G   It's all mind over matter and it's not really that bad once you get past the idea of eating a whole bird.  Take Borger and eating dog for example. For most people in North America the idea alone of eating dog is enough to put them off the idea of ever trying it because it's not normal for our society while those who are open minded will chow down as there really is no difference between us raising chickens to eat and Filipino's raising dog to eat. I cannot understand how some people think that raising cows or pigs for food is 100% acceptable yet they think those who choose to eat horses, cats or dogs should be jailed for animal cruelty. Us humans are a weird bunch."

903705,crappieperchhunter,2015-03-15 04:04:00,2582,"Not a fan of salting. Yes it does tenderize...no doubt. But it alters the texture, taste. You are either on board or not. I am not. Aging however works for me, I put a thawed prime rib roast in the fridge uncovered for a week before i cook it and then cook it slow at 225 degrees until the internal temp is 135-140...heaven....and very rarely have left overs. Only problem... when you do a roast this way...no juice for gravy. But we have a killer mushroom gravy recipe to solve that."
903271,Headhunter,2015-03-13 14:28:00,5703,"Thanks for this! I had no idea, but I will certainly be giving it a go with cheaper (is that possible anymore!!!!??) cuts. As far as BBQ'ing in the winter, well anything below minus 15 and I won't BBQ as it is just too cold for the BBQ to retain heat. Slightly off topic... I spoke to the butcher at my local Metro. Just a heads up! When meat goes on sale there, it has been aged for 28 days prior to the sale. They order what they think will last for the entirety of the sale. When they run out, they just order in whatever they can get to meet consumer demand and that usually means meat that is not aged as long! So, if you see a sale that you want to take advantage of, be sure to buy in the first three days of the sale and you will be getting a better quality of meat. Now I gotta go replenish my stock of Kosher Salt!!!! HH"

903444,Salmonidstalker,2015-03-13 23:27:00,265,"Have you actually tried this?  I'm a butcher of 15 years, and in my experience, salt dries it out too much causing the meat to be tougher, you want to keep all the juices in it that you can.  Another tip for cooking any meat other than birds, leave it sit on your counter top for at least 2 hours prior to cooking, bringing it to room temp causes the the muscle fibres to relax and cook more evenly and be more tender and juicy.  You can also pick up a pack of Frenchs Marinade for $1.50, just add water, or any other liquid you want, let the meat sit in it for an hour or so.  When it comes to meats, you truly do get what you pay for.  Try to buy AAA or better, pick out a steak or roast with good marbling, don't pick out the leanest piece in the counter.  Animal fats are natural fats and are actually good for you and for your joints.  There's a reason why prime rib is more tender than sirloin, and its because of that marbling. Agree 100%.  except for animal fats being natural fats part.  They are not good for you.  Fat from fruits, vegetables, some oils, seeds and nuts are your healthy fats.  Sorry to sidetrack the OP's post.  I think if you have to let a steak sit in salt for an hour and a half, you've got a crappy piece of meat.  Unless you're making some kind of jerky or salt cured salmon, but even doing that requires more seasoning than salt to maximize flavor."

By the way I am fussy when it comes to good quality steaks but when rib eyes are $40.00/kg I get nervous.  I purchased a whole loin the other day - all steaks $7.99/ lb. Aged 21 days.  Most grocery stores age their beef only 7 days.  no need to do that with blade steaks, they are awesome on their own.  the blade comes after the prime rib, and its basically the poor mans prime rib, it has great marbling, and loose fibres, making it very very tender, and its why its used to make pulled beef sandwiches!  also, $7.99 for a loin of beef is little pricey! we just had to raise our price to $6.39/lb that AAA aged minimum 21 days Ontario beef, no growth hormones added or antibiotics.  Nah.. nothing better than waiting for the 50% off in the meat counter because they're not BRIGHT red anymore! Then a night spent marinated with Olive Oil and the Keg secret receipe, then out to warm up before hitting the Q.   Butchers secret! take the darker steaks, they have the most age on them.  We had a customer buy a whole prime rib, but had us age it, he would take a steak a week off of it.  it made it to 87 days old, reached its peak flavour at around 65 days"

It may be common knowledge to some but I just learned this trick myself a couple years ago and it really works!  You can transform the cheapest, toughest cut of beef into ultra tender steak by tenderizing it with coarse salt.  Cover the cut of meat with salt and let it sit 1 hour for every inch, so if it's 11/2"" thick you let it sit for 11/2 hours. The salt draws moisture out of the meat and breaks down the protein molecules making it unbelievably tender.  Thoroughly wash off all the salt, season it as you wish and grill it. You won't believe how good it is.  There's a youtube video describing the process:  "
