To me, it seems to be the most natural way of addressing a male and a female at once, but I have homestly never thought about addressing groups people this thouroughly until now.  On a side note, I was at Cdn Tire earlier tonight buying some Seafoam for my outboard, and when I was paying, the cashier, a woman probably in her mid 50's or so, kept on addressing me as ""sir"". I thought it sounded pretty funny considering I'm basically a kid."

902666,mattybculp,2015-03-10 13:24:00,388,"I was always taught that calling someone Mr. or Mrs. was a sign of respect, I could never imagine being 10 or 12 and walking into my friends house and saying Hi Doug, how's Linda? It just wouldn't seem right. Now that I'm an ""adult"" I will address people by there first name. I deal with a good number or seniors in my business and a lot of them are veterans, so if they come in and they are a senior or vet I will begin our conversation by saying ""Hello Mr. Smith, can I call you John or would you prefer Mr. Smith.""  Most of the time they will say ""Mr. Smith was my father and John is just fine."" I just look at it as an initial sign of respect, nothing more. Its the way I was raised same as please and thank you and holding the door for a stranger.  What I find with young tykes that friends have, instead of them calling me by my first name only they call me uncle matt, (even though there is no blood relation) which is a lot easier on me feeling my true age and that I'm not 19 anymore. It has never done me a dis-service to address someone by Mrs, Mr, or Sir, and right after the  introduction ask them how they would like to be addressed, its surprising sometimes to find out what name they would like to be called, one time an individual came in around the age of 87 and went by the name ""Scoops"" apparently it had something to do with ice cream from his child hood in the 30's and his whole life that's what he was known as, and as weird as it was to address a gentlemen that many years my senior I respected his request and from there on out he is just ""Scoops"". So I guess what I'm trying to say is that I will teach my children to address there elders as Mr, Mrs, Sir, and if that person would like to be addressed by a different name then that would be perfectly acceptable. When I went to school I called my teachers by Mr, Ms, or Mrs, not there first name, but when I went to school I feared/respected my teachers, knowing any report to my parents may result in a tanning, I don't know if that's so common anymore."

They're older and often wiser so using the formal term acknowledges that assumption.  Many kids today are taught that they are just as important and valued as anyone else so don't call older people by the formal names; in fact use their first name if you can.  Wonder why the younger people have less respect for elders than their parents did. Blame it on the parents who convince the kid that the cop, teacher, doctor, etc are no better than him/her."

They may have proved that they have the ability to attain a good respected, in most cases, position but as far as importance I think everyone is as important as the next person. Pick up a newspaper or read on the world wide web some in positions that in the past were supposed to garner immediate respect have screwed up, big time. I remember some years ago I went into my Dad's Dr's office with him and questioned some of the things he was prescribing for my Dad as well as the way he spoke down to him. My father went up one side and down the other on me afterwards saying "" You can't talk to a Doctor like that!"" Yes you can Dad, he is no better than you or I. He still thinks professionals are to be held in higher esteem than others. Respect is earned not based on title. One can respect the office but at the same time not have respect for the individual. Prime Minister comes to mind. This particular ""professional"" I do not have respect for. My father changed his tune when he found out this MD ,rightfully I must add,pulled his drivers licence without talking to him about it first."

I'm currently studying civil engineering at McMaster University, and what I think is really funny about some of my peers that will also be professionals in the next few years, is the way some of them dress and act.  I'm not allowed to say or even hint at some of the names they call eachother without even thinking about it, and I find it kind of funny that somebody attending university finds it perfectly fine to go around wearing a baggy white T-shirt capable of covering a bed mattress, a snap-back baseball cap, and $300 tennis shoes.

902261,lew,2015-03-08 13:17:00,12766,"There's one restaurant my wife and I frequent and we often get the same waitress. She's very nice and great at her job but she calls my wife ""dear"". My wife is probably 45 years older than her but just shrugs it off.  Kinda bugs me but I shrug it off too"
902263,John,2015-03-08 13:40:00,2956,"I was never in the military but know how to treat people with respect after 40 years in a service profession. We taught our kids and they are teaching our grandkids to be polite, have good manners be tolerant and have respect for all living things AND even to be polite to those egotists who demand respect and subservience for no other reason than they like their ego's to be stroked. One earns (commands rather than demands) respect through example and leadership and is not a one way street. As for the greeting ""guys"", I have mixed feelings. Would I like my wife and I to be addressed as ""guys"", not really but could live with it rather than making a scene if the person addressing us was friendly and sincere."
902267,kickingfrog,2015-03-08 14:09:00,8333,"People call my wife miss at their own peril. I'm more concerned with someone's actions then their words.  Now, get off my lawn!"
902269,Joey,2015-03-08 14:25:00,9122,Just don't call me Ma'am
902270,Old Ironmaker,2015-03-08 14:33:00,8243,"I don't expect anyone to call me sir, it's this "" Hi guys"" we get from waitresses that is my pet peeve. I don't lose any sleep over it that why it's called a pet peeve, no big deal. As for kids calling adults their parents age by their first names, blame us, it was the children of people my age that let it pass. I have a Godson that was calling my father who was old enough to be his Grandfather, by his first name. His Father never said a word. I calmly explained to him why he should call someone 60 years older than him Mr. The kid was good with that, and for how rude that child was when he was a kid he is the most polite young men you will ever meet."

But I absolutely don't care how others do it.  Once had a guy who appeared to be the same age as me call me ""sonny"" during our whole conversation. That was a little weird."
902283,lew,2015-03-08 15:19:00,12766,"Even as a small kid back in the 50's I called all my parents friends  by their 1st names and that's just exactly how they wanted it. When my kids came along it was the same, they called my friends by name and their friends called me Lew  As a kid my aunts & uncles were 1st names and my cousins called my parents by their names.  Only people in all our families that has titles were Grandparents  All of my wife's family was the same and still is.  And in case anyone is wondering, EVERYBODY turned out great."
902285,mike rousseau,2015-03-08 15:24:00,4661,"Not to be a smart guy but what's a waitress supposed to say to a group of 4-10 people...? Address each one individually as ma'am or sir? Or good afternoon ladies and gentleman...?  I've worked in restaurants (all about as classy as the next... Kelsey/east side Mario's...) and they all said ""guys"" or ""everyone""... It's more how you great a friend then a customer... Its to make thdm feel like regulars... It's like the show cheers... If they yelled sir or mr.____ instead of Norm it would be weird...  I work for one of the biggest companies in the world and the director for my region who is higher then the highest person at my site of 1200 people is addressed by his first name... We all are... If someone says Mr.______ it's more jokingly... We all talk to each other as equals with higher or lower levels of responsibility... Not many people use the term ""my boss"" where I work... If my direct reports that I supervise called my Mr.Rousseau and sir It would be weird... Most of them are twice my age..."
902286,Fisherman,2015-03-08 15:25:00,7201,Just don't call me Ma'am Okay Ma'am....I can run faster scared that you can with a rusty screwdriver..
902288,Big Cliff,2015-03-08 15:30:00,6899,Okay Ma'am....I can run faster scared that you can with a rusty screwdriver.. That I'd have to see
902289,kickingfrog,2015-03-08 15:32:00,8333,Last night at the Colt's game I sat next to 2 guys who were in their 30's. Every second sentence was punctuated with a fist-bump. My 6 year old son knew they idiots.  Get off my lawn!
