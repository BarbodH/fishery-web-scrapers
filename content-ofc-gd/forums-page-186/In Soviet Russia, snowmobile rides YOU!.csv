902238,Old Ironmaker,2015-03-08 08:17:00,8243,"Vodka, amazing stuff it is. Want to make your friends laugh, just pretend the machine is a human pasta roller.  When I opened the file the A years worth of dash cam in Russia video came up, you have to see that. I guess in Russia the first thing the passengers do is get out of the car and run like a Bat out of Hell. Those little cars in Russia basically explode when hit. Sorry can't cut and paste for some reason Oh I know it's a Hewlett Packard piece of excrement."
