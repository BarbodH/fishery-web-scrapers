I say make it legal to grow in your own backyard and only tax it if you're too lazy or can't grow it and have to buy.  Regulate it like alcohol for operating motor vehicles etc.

Just from what I have read about testing people on welfare here for drugs? That plan is costing more than the savings from it."
904680,netminder,2015-03-19 16:50:00,514,"I'd vote for Trudeau over Harper for many reasons other than this, but that's beside the point.  I think it's fascinating how it seems pretty much everyone is in favour of this, even some of the hard-line conservative old-timers posting here. I agree that pot is a lot less harmful than most other drugs, especially the legal recreational drugs, and especially the prescription drugs big pharma would like us to be addicted to. That being said, saying it's ""of the earth"", or completely safe is completely assinine.  1. It's currently illegal and for sale on the black market. Do you honestly believe that the growers are paying close attention to safe levels of pesticides or synthetric fertilizers they're using?  2. Even breathing in super heated air is harmful to your mouth, throat and lungs. That's beside the point that it contains way more tar than even tobacco smoke.  I would love for it to be legalized, but that's mainly because I hate the idea of buying it from the black market, and the people who sell it now often come accross as the scum of the earth. Keeping it away from kids? yeah, let's trust the drug dealers now to ensure that doesn't happen... Hell, there are soon to be at least 4 states that will have it legalized, it's time for socialist Canada to follow suit."
904681,fish_fishburn,2015-03-19 16:51:00,1311,After reading all this I think it should be legalized and taxed for both medicinal use as well as recreation use. Why one and not the other. Also let each adult over 18 in any household grow a max of 6 plants each or a max of 12 per household for personal use. This will keep the price reasonable for all. If the govt doesn't allow us to grow our own plants if we choose to they will have the monopoly and can charge whatever they want and will screw up the whole system by charging way to much. If the price is reasonable most people would be happy to buy it and pay taxes on it from some type of dispensary. No different then buying veggies at the grocery store. You can make your own wine and beer at home and grow your own herbs and vegetables so weed should be no different. Its really just a harmless plant
904689,DRIFTER_016,2015-03-19 17:16:00,10439,"Last month pot became legal in Alaska. Now there is no problem having it but they have laws on where you can partake and also growing your own. For instance, there is a limit of 6 plants per household and only 3 can be flowering @ once. Smoking weed in public is against the law and ticketable just like drinking out of residence. Also because the feds still have pot as being illegal big trouble can be had consuming on federal land."
904692,Rod Caster,2015-03-19 17:24:00,5784,"If they are gonna legalize it, make it a free-market item, just like beer and most every other item you can name. Free-market means anyone can build it, make it, manufacture it, grow it and the market decides it's fate. I can make all the crappy beer I want at home, but I prefer good quality beer, not homemade swill, so I purchase it instead. The market hath spoken."

His study, the largest and longest running of its kind, concluded that marijuana use had no measurable correlation with lung cancer.  In fact, it determined that occasional marijuana smokers had better lung function than non smokers.  A lot of what people believe about marijuana now days are are holdovers from the propaganda war on weed.  There is a lot of quality info out there now from reputable sources, I suggest you might want to re-examine the genesis of your opinions.

904698,manitoubass2,2015-03-19 17:45:00,11391,"I mentioned it is of the earth, and it is left fairly unadultereated. Im not saying it doesnt have its risks but its minimal at worst. Its far less processed then say cocaine or heroin.  And if something that exist in nature isnt safe to consume, thats not the governments call IMO.  Im guessing the body has cannabinoid receptors for a reason, same with nicotine. Heck there is even opiate receptors."
904709,netminder,2015-03-19 18:45:00,514,"Fair enough. I've heard plenty of evidence on both sides of the argument. I guess what you could say is there doesn't seem to be any health benefits for healthy people to smoke it. Just like everyone else here, I ""used to""    smoke it, and probably more than my fair share. From my experiences, it does effect my breathing and performance in athletics, especially from daily smoking. One thing you need to realize when reading some of those articles and studies, ""regular"" or ""frequent"" smoking is classified as more than once a month.  The plant isn't heavily processed, but the chemicals that it's treated with are, and they're still there when it's smoked. There are also plenty of things that are ""of the earth"" that are incredibly toxic."

904715,manitoubass2,2015-03-19 19:12:00,11391,"Chemicals come in more in large scale harvesting, not homegrowing.  Yes many things exist in nature that are incredibly toxic, thats not debatable. BUT, does the government regulate those?  They have no business IMO telling anyone which plants they cannot harvest, smoke etc.  Of course smoking weed hurts your lungs to a degree, your inhaling smoke. Its a moot point. You could smoke a dandelion and it will effect your lungs. But if you enjoy it or get some benefit from it do you think I should tell you you cant do it?  Lots of studies portray marijuana as bad because its an elicit substance. Since when does the government want to admit they are wrong and backtrack to make it legal?  These are the same folks that pushed codeine on toddlers for anything and everything in the mid 1900's.  They have an agenda, so all studies done by them or supported by them are flawed in their very nature.  You need independant, double randomized placebo studies on large groups, varying in age, sex, nationality etc to draw any informed conclusion."

I don't know how many times I have been sitting around with a bunch of guys (not necessarily guys I know) when someone that is hammered on alcohol starts into those that smoke pot, calling them pot heads druggies etc. I just laugh to myself because I can't say I have seen drunken behaviour from someone who was stoned on weed. Another issue with legalizing is what to do with vehicle operators. It is my understanding that THC remains in your body for approximately 1 month. ""Call into work, sorry boss I smoked a joint last night, so I will have to take a month off before I can drive to work again"" What kind of breathalizer would they use?

What Im talking about is really just a different prospective on how the mind and body function.  Your biology is the addiction to live.  They are very closely intertwined.  Part of my point is addiction is kinda a dirty word.

Some are saying that it will cost the upwards of 50k a year if they are forced to buy from the govt program, so they won't be able to afford their medicine.  So..... If the people who need it for medicine aren't allowed to grow it, basically for free. Then have to buy it but can't afford too. It will stop being produced...  Then a natural product that works, by all accounts, will probably be replaced with some chemicals dreamed up in labs by the Pfizers of the world...

Realistically there no way that minors will stop using it, if it is legal, because they sure are smoking up now when it isn't. That being said Colorado has proven the legal Pot industry can control the sale of Cannabis to minors better than alcohol retailers are of selling booze to them.  Well I agree it has to taxed and monitored, some states, are finding if the taxes are too high, the black market suppliers still fill the need for it. The trouble is once it is sold who knows where it was bought?  I envision seeing people at home putting black market pot into legit packaging. Sort of like when my mom would put store brand Honey O's into a Cheerio's box to make us kids think we had money. Or like Herb Tarlek aging scotch on WKRP LOL."

I have read all the comments and it seems like most are for legalization. I am for legalization as well because I cannot think of one reason  prohibition of pot benefits society. If there is, hopefully someone will shine some light on that for me. Now the cons are running their attack adds on tv about the libs legalizing pot and our kids are going to be getting pot from the libs and pot is 400% stronger then it used to be. These are all lies and the cons should be ashamed of themselves for thinking that the general public is so stupid to believe this.  I asked my 16yr old nephew this question on the weekend. I said to him. What is easier for you to get at school, pot or booze. His reply was anyone can get a bag of weed at school within 10 to 20 minutes, but for booze it would take a couple of days due to the logistics of getting someone to purchase it for you. So nothing has changed since I was in high school in the 70's. I am thinking that Harper will be announcing that he will legalize pot as well if he gets back in. If I was him I would do it now so the libs cant use that as part of their platform"

What people do in their free time doesn't bother me in the least so long as I don't have to be a part of it and they aren't harming anyone else.  As for beer to relax and unwind?  Yes, if you NEED it to relax and unwind then that means you have an addiction of sorts in my books.  I NEED nothing to relax and unwind, and I can't imagine why someone would need a substance to do so.  Nonetheless, if someone needs that crutch, I'll refer to the earlier part of my post.  I don't care what people drink or smoke, so long as they aren't hurting or affecting anyone else.  Lots of folks won't like that, and I get it, but there it is nonetheless."

I will admit I smoked my fair share in high school and university, and will partake from time to time now....(been a long time) only when I know I have zero responsibilities. ( which is rare) I can't remember the last time I bought it to be honest and the last time I blazed was years ago...  It is already legal if you hold a license. You can even grow it for personal consumption with said license or purchase it from a government approved grower.  I say legalize it, use as little legislation as possible to make it happen.  The problem I see here is Harper would not let this happen... Given the amount of money his government has invested in setting up grow-ops and licensing others to be able to grow for the medical licenses... His cabinet will have to admit they wasted a boat load of your $$$$.  As for young Mr. Justin...... I pray he never gets to sit in the big boy chair. Not that I am anti liberal...

Its in the courts now and he will probably lose because he is stomping all over their constitutional rights to do this. They have been allowed to grow their own since 2002.

But if someone wants to cloud their perceptions, fill yer boots as far as I'm concerned. But if that grandstander is elected on the lets legalize pot platform, we are in huge trouble as a nation!

So they try other things to find out what else they lied about?  I don't use it myself anymore, but did in the past, they should spend the time, money, and manpower to get rid of the really dangerous drugs out there?

904185,AKRISONER,2015-03-17 18:44:00,5558,there are some fantastic statistics about the effect legalization has had in places like Colorado.  perhaps the most interesting one  http://rt.com/usa/182940-medical-marijuana-opioid-overdose/  personally I wish it got legalized so that stoners would have nothing to talk about anymore lol
904189,John Bacon,2015-03-17 18:57:00,3277,"I don't smoke it myself; however, I do support legalization.  I know some otherwise law abiding citizens who hold steady jobs or run businesses who do smoke pot.  I don't think they should have criminal records just because they smoke a joint one in awhile.  That is still not enough to get me to vote for Trudeau though."
904196,aznphil,2015-03-17 19:18:00,73,now theres an actual idea that can actually boost the economy...one more idea than all the other parties
904202,Joey,2015-03-17 19:37:00,9122,"I used to smoke it but don't anymore.  I'm definitely for it being legalized, but don't think I'd vote for him myself."
904203,lew,2015-03-17 19:46:00,12766,"Never tried it either but have plenty of friends who did and it wouldn't bother me in the least if it was legalized.  As for Trudeau, I'd vote for a dead carp before him."
904204,Terry,2015-03-17 19:49:00,14456,"vote liberal   legal pot  legal pot      vote liberal      sorry marry jane, you will just have to wait"

904209,dave524,2015-03-17 20:09:00,4508,"Tell me they don't looked blasted   I'm not making fun of anyone's physical appearance, again. "
904210,123chadder,2015-03-17 20:16:00,165,"the frustrating thing is hemp is cannabis,the natural fiber that built the us.....strongest organic fiber in the world!billion dollar industry not utilized cause the government cant admit they were wrong"
904214,dave524,2015-03-17 20:27:00,4508,"I see hemp products all the time in stores and BTW I support the legalization of marijuana, actually lived a block or 2 east of Rochdale College while attending U of T 69 to 74, Yorkville was a couple of blocks the other direction, not the high end yuppie shops in those days, everyone did it then."
904216,Blue Lk,2015-03-17 20:42:00,337,"If by some miracle this ""drama teacher"" becomes our next PM,I have 2 things on my agenda, 1 Increase the size of my herb garden. 2 Buy shares of snack food companies. "
904217,craigdritchie,2015-03-17 21:34:00,1586,"The two problems with Justin Trudeau are that (1) he's a liberal, and (2) he's a moron. Unless you really want to lose your house and life savings, pray to God this is the high point in his political career."
904222,Paudash,2015-03-17 21:47:00,273,"For him to lead with this shows what else he has got to offer nothing at all, he is a waste of space living off his Dads good name  can't wait for his first debate"
904229,glen,2015-03-17 22:12:00,2641,It's settled then.  he will get in.

904233,Rizzo,2015-03-17 22:25:00,4754,"don't really care about the legalization or not, but anyone who votes for Trudeau has clearly smoked waaaayyyy too much already"
904234,manitoubass2,2015-03-17 22:27:00,11391,Sad but probably true lol
904236,GbayGiant,2015-03-17 22:40:00,1780,I wouldn't trust that guy at all. He's the biggest fraud of them all IMO. This country would go downhill fast with him running the show. Scary!  Cheers Like Harper has done such a fantastic job. The country couldn't be in worse shape. Wait and see.
904237,NAW,2015-03-17 22:45:00,4022,I'm not to sure about this one.  For sure. 100% agree with the pot thing.  And I was raised Liberal. But I don't know about this Justin kid...
