901589,outllaw,2015-03-04 20:05:00,1232,well folks the Detroit river musky thumper had his day in court. he received 1000.00 fine and 2 year suspension.
901592,landry,2015-03-04 20:15:00,1005,He will likely not pay and keep fishing. That's my prediction
901595,BillM,2015-03-04 20:25:00,17367,"I'm pretty sure he won't be able to renew anything (drivers licence, etc) if that fine isn't paid."
901597,cheaptackle,2015-03-04 20:32:00,849,Just curious - was it the first offence for him?  Heard he'd been around the block a few times before.  Michael

901613,Bill Shearer,2015-03-04 22:07:00,456,"Angler who purposely killed a musky he caught on the Detroit River receives harsh penalty for action We reported in September about an encounter on the Detroit River where two anglers video taped another angler who caught and purposely killed a musky and threw it back in the water. They confronted the man. Their video led to the identification of Edmond Parent. Parent was sentenced and fined on March 4, 2015 by the Ontario Court of Justice. Parent apologized for his actions publicly on video in this article from The Windsor Star. Here is the full release on his sentence and fine. Release from Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry: A Windsor man has been fined $1,000 and is banned from fishing for two years for a fishing violation. Edmond Parent pleaded guilty to failing to release an under-sized muskellunge (musky) he caught in a way that caused the least harm to the fish. In addition, he is banned from fishing for two years. He cannot possess or associate with anyone possessing any fishing equipment on any body of water or adjacent shoreline. Court heard that on September 3, 2014, two anglers were fishing on the Detroit River at the mouth of Lake St. Clair near Windsor when they saw an angler in a boat next to them catch an under-sized musky. The individual struck the musky on the head killing it, and then threw the fish back into the water. The anglers captured the incident on video and posted it on YouTube. Conservation officers started investigating after they learned of the video and were able to confirm its authenticity. With the help of the public, officers identified Parent as the person responsible for killing the fish. The Detroit River is located in Fisheries Management Zone 19, where anglers with a sport fishing licence can catch and keep one musky that is 112 centimetres (44 inches) or more, while anglers with a conservation fishing licence cannot keep any muskies caught. Justice of the Peace Salma Jafar heard the case in the Ontario Court of Justice, Windsor, on March 4, 2015. Anglers are reminded that they must immediately release any fish they catch that are illegal to possess, such as fish caught of a prohibited size, during the closed season or in excess of the catch and possession limits. This rule does not apply to invasive species like gobies which should be destroyed.

902049,esoxansteel,2015-03-07 00:29:00,1307,"He will be looking over his shoulders now, as many know his name, and who he looks like after his interview with the local press, the 1000.00 is fine, and the 2 year fishing ban as well, at least the courts are starting to value our natural resources for a change, and make the efforts of our CO's worth while"
902054,leaf4,2015-03-07 01:02:00,2466,"Seems a little light but at least justice was served, would've liked to have seen his stuff seized"
904040,frodobuggins,2015-03-17 00:16:00,127,Made the cbc. http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/windsor/edmond-parent-on-online-shaming-for-clubbing-illegally-caught-fish-1.2997259
904053,Tom McCutcheon,2015-03-17 01:39:00,627,"I don't believe it......The guy still doesn't get it does he?......He's feeling sorry for himself now......  ""the fish had no chance of surviving""  Yep he's right, especially after he bonked it.....  Stupid ASS."
904114,landry,2015-03-17 13:58:00,1005,I agree with you Tomfoolery. He is not being honest or accountable in even the smallest manner.
904115,SirCranksalot,2015-03-17 14:00:00,3291,I agree with the guy who caught him on video----time to let it go and move on.
904128,landry,2015-03-17 15:06:00,1005,"It'd be easier to move on if he was accountable. However, he is who he is and I can't change that. Justice was served - it's unlikely but hopefully he becomes a more respectful outdoorsman."
904235,outllaw,2015-03-17 22:35:00,1232,"its obvious,he wants limelite. cyring to cbc wow...loser... bullying c,mon. if you folks had any clue of this person you would yell louder. letting it go YES but the continuence of his antics?..sadly my taxes in Windsor will help pay as he,s on assistance ."
904245,landry,2015-03-17 23:00:00,1005,I loved the examples of online shunning in the cbc article - all those people deserved what they got.
904297,Pigeontroller,2015-03-18 02:22:00,2793,If this guy had a brain at all he'd shut up and stop making himself recognizable to the entire fishing community!
904331,outllaw,2015-03-18 11:47:00,1232,pigeontroller... dead on that comment.
904407,SuperDave,2015-03-18 15:53:00,204,I agree he's just made himself look worse. Didn't think that was possible. Glad he got fined and lost his license.
