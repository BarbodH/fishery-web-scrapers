905291,sleepjigging,2015-03-22 02:55:00,207,I read that Lake Simcoe whitefish are special subspecies. They are prized by some anglers. Are they prized because they are bigger than usual?  
905292,Freshtrax,2015-03-22 03:01:00,2215,I'd say so there's a 14 lb er.  Hanging on the wall at the tackle shop at minuets point.
905304,Joeytier,2015-03-22 04:36:00,3990,"The average size of whitefish in Simcoe is pretty huge compared to just about everywhere else, that's for sure."
905307,BowSlayer101,2015-03-22 08:59:00,296,They're pretty big but you should see nip whities if you think simcoe whities are big!
905320,captpierre,2015-03-22 12:35:00,2521,Lots to eat compared to Haliburton  and Muskoka lakes.
905321,Terry,2015-03-22 12:39:00,14456,i know nips herring can be big but I have never got a real big whitefish on nip simcoe humpback whitefish are big
905380,Sinker,2015-03-22 16:56:00,8692,There are no whitefish in simcoe!!
