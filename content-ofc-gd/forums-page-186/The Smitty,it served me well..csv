903768,misfish,2015-03-15 18:21:00,29133,"Before I made this Smitty,( my first) I seen a lot of them out on the ice the last couple of years. After this first year of having it,I cant believe I didnt have one before. It held all my gear that I needed for my days outing. Heater,finder,shovel,auger,drill and hub and of course,my fighting sticks.  It served me well I must say. The only mishap was the one ski broke off when towed by the yamadoo. Was not surprised,as it was built to be pulled by walking, not meant to be banged off snow drifts at warp speed. LOL. With the new rebuild,it is solid now to be towed with ease.    I know the new owner will get alot of fun out of it next season and seasons beyond.      We still got a bit of time for some perching and pike.  I cant wait til I get my new one built.  Been a fun ice season .  "
903769,davey buoy,2015-03-15 18:26:00,5505,Can't imagine the next one  lol.Love the rod holders.Mine ran very well on Sat.Looks like rod holders will be my next addition.What size tubing did you use Brian?.
903771,Terry,2015-03-15 18:29:00,14456,if the guy driving the yamadoo wasn't trying to break speed records it may not have broke...lol it does work well
903774,kickingfrog,2015-03-15 18:37:00,8333,You sold it?  Can't wait to see 2 point oh.
903804,misfish,2015-03-15 20:38:00,29133,"Dave,it,s 1.750.  Rob yes,along with the tow bar.  I cant keep everything in my truck, 12 months of the year.LOL Condo living will do that to ya.  It,s ok bud,you were built for speed."
903807,kickingfrog,2015-03-15 20:43:00,8333,So you're making a new one every fall? You should take some orders. It might only take you twice as long to make 4 as 1.
903811,misfish,2015-03-15 20:49:00,29133,"So you're making a new one every fall? You should take some orders. It might only take you twice as long to make 4 as 1.  No,my next one is something Im thinking about doing a production run.  I see that there was a dragons den thing here in Barrie a week or so ago. To bad I didnt know about it.  My next one is way different.  If you missed it,I call it a ,smitty in a bag. Just working on how to get it in a bag.LOL Well I do,but need to find a supplier.  Always thinking, but no money to make it happen.LOL"
903820,Basschaser77,2015-03-15 20:59:00,32,It looked very well fabricated. Please post pics when you complete the new and improved version.
903922,wormdunker,2015-03-16 08:23:00,1711,Awesome rig!  I like it!  Tie all your gear down securely.  I'm reading a lot of posts about guys looking for lost gear.
903925,misfish,2015-03-16 10:23:00,29133,Ya  I seen a lot of them. Even guys leaving stuff behind. Are they all in that much of a hurry to get home? Im not.LOL  Thanks
904041,SmokestackLightnin,2015-03-17 00:16:00,390,The rod holders bolted to the back - Great Idea!!
904042,PUMP KNOWS,2015-03-17 00:27:00,937,That's awesome!  And good luck on your next design.
904268,ketchenany,2015-03-18 00:12:00,3229," Now that I know what a smitty is, I think I built one in the 80s sort of. It was blue box bolted to skiis and it wasn't raised. I only used it to carry wood to the hut. pulled with a snowmobile. Never had tow bar, went all owner the place when empty on the way back lol  Nice build Brian."
