I was throwing a big Rapala flat rap in hopes of catching a big Walleye or Bass.  I had a feeling that a musky would hit it, but knew how hard they were to catch.  Lessons learned: -Need a bigger net.  We bought the biggest net Le Baron had the next week.  Of course it didn't stop there. Immediately I needed all this musky gear and now I'm poor and living on the streets.  Anyways enjoy, sorry for the newbies getting excited over a 36"" fish LOL.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqnXC0hOyC8&feature=youtu.be  No harm was done to this fish, had the hooks out and it took off like a bullet as soon as I got it in the water."

904444,James77,2015-03-18 17:57:00,175,Sorry fixed it
904446,James77,2015-03-18 17:59:00,175," There's a picture, any idea why it was missing part of it's gill plate? Poor guy."

904521,lew,2015-03-18 21:54:00,12766,"Congrats on your 1st musky, that's the one you never forget.  Don't be concerned about the gill, they get all kinds of injuries that don't affect them. I've got at least a couple with 1/2 the upper jaw missing."

I've got at least a couple with 1/2 the upper jaw missing. Thanks Lew, Are these spawning injuries normally? I see a lot of them have bite marks or scars near the tails. Is there a way to tell Male and Female muskies apart?  Thanks James"
904660,lew,2015-03-19 15:08:00,12766,"I'm no expert James but I'd imagine a lot of the smaller injuries are from spawning fights or even from being caught by fishermen, but the major injuries like missing jaws may be birth defects.  As for  telling the difference between males & females, I have no idea, but perhaps at mating time the males are the ones with the biggest smiles"
904718,James77,2015-03-19 19:32:00,175,Haha good one!
904726,TenInchJake,2015-03-19 19:54:00,21,Probably the most expensive fish you will ever catch. That's been my experience anyway. Congrats.
