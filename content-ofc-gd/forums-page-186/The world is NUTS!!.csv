Billy Currington said ""God is great, beer is good, and people are crazy"""
904847,Big Cliff,2015-03-20 12:49:00,6899,"Here are a few from Canada:  In Alberta, there is a city law that states that any person being released from prison must be given a handgun with bullets, and a horse so that they can ride out of town.  In British Colombia, it is illegal to kill a sasquatch.  In Hartland New Brunswick you are not aloud to make jokes about people with mustaches. Unless that person or persons first name begins with the letter ""A"" and last name begins with the letter ""N"".  In Etobicoke, the bylaw states that ‘no more than 3.5 inches of water is allowed in a bathtub’.  Guelph, is an official ‘NO-PEE’ zone.  In Toronto, it is illegal to drag a dead horse down Yonge Street on a Sunday. Apparently any other day of the week is fine!"
