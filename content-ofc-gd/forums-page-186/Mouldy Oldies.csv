905037,spincast,2015-03-21 00:38:00,3279,those scenes a the memorial bring back some memories.
905126,smitty55,2015-03-21 14:04:00,928,My wife caught that show a couple of weeks ago and loved it. I don't think she knew much about them at the time but now has spent some good coin at itunes.  Cheers
905142,bigugli,2015-03-21 15:40:00,6138,That whole folk music culture had a big influence as I grew up. When Mary Travers died of cancer I thought I had lost a dear friend.
905219,Ice Fishing Ham,2015-03-21 22:45:00,83,"I did see some of the special, so many memories. If I recall there was some issues about Puff the Magic Dragon being a song about toking. Kind-a fits if you thing of it!"
