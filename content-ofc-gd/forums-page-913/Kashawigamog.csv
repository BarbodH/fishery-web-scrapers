291972,burnerator,2009-01-13 23:53:00,3,My son and a couple of his friends have invited me to go ice fishing with them this Friday/Sat/Sunday and we will be staying at Kashaga Cottages.Any advice regarding what the walleye or crappie are hitting on would be much appreciated.  Thanks
292000,mikegta,2009-01-14 00:50:00,39,"i fish at kens place a few times a year and do fairly well.  most of my luck has come fishing 18-25 fow with a silver buckshot tipped with a minnow. swedish pimples tipped with minnows have also been good producers for me.  my best luck has come from the bite seemed to be at its best just as the sun is setting. if you look t the right of the large cottage on the shore you will see where a small stram feeds into the lake, there is a point there with gradual rocky slope,i would try 20-30 feet off shore on this point   ken has minnows on site and also rents marcum flashers.  good luck mike"
