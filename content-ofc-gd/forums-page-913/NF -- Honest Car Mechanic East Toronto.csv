290871,musky_man,2009-01-11 21:16:00,159,"Hi,  Like many of you, I am always looking for an honest car mechanic. I was going to Owens Automotive, but they had to close up due to illness.  Looks like I need a head gasket replaced on my 1996 Toyota Camry and I am loathed to get raked over the coals at the dealerships.  So -- anyone got a mechanic they are real happy with in the east end of Toronto?  Thanks,  Mark"

290931,Guest skeeter99,2009-01-11 23:04:00,0,  well if it aint overheating or antifreeze is not disappearing or the oil is not going light brown(mixing with antifreeze)then it is probably not a head gasket  what makes u think u need a head gasket  extremely...extremely rare in that year of car

He doesn't need to advertise, his reputation is so good that his entire business is built on referrals and he is always busy! Karr's Cars on Snug Harbour Rd. just N of Lindsay. I have nothing but respect for this young man. I have referred several people to him and never been disapointed! If you are willing to travell this far, let me know and I'll get his phone # for you."
291203,musky_man,2009-01-12 11:21:00,159,"Clap-it,  A toyota mechanic said it did and I can see it leaking.  The oil still looks OK and it may be leaking outward only i.e., not going in to the cooling system.  In my search around the internet, head gaskets were a weakness of this car.  It may go years without leaking into the the colling system, but I donly like to take the chance.  If anyone else had any other opinions, please le me know.  Thanks for the other referrals, guys."
