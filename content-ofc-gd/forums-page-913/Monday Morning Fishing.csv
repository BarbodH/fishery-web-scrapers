291189,rbaquial,2009-01-12 07:13:00,968,Where you fishin'?
291211,Riparian,2009-01-12 11:46:00,269,good luck!
291213,Paully,2009-01-12 11:54:00,712,Good luck out there... Was down by an eastern trib sunday evening..... 75% frozen but did see a bow in the clear icy waters! Too bad i did'ent have a rod with me....
291655,profisher25,2009-01-13 04:38:00,185,Which river did you go fishing at?
291674,young_one,2009-01-13 07:27:00,620,"Went east of TO, within 1hrs of driving. A few creeks had small openings, very hard to fish. Tough condition for sure, hooking January Steelhead is not an easy thing. Last time I was lucky, today, nothing. Well the book that taught me everything about Steelhead fishing said Janurary is the toughest month to fish for them. I should probably start mixing fuel for the ice auger and hit the hardwater soon, well the temperature for the rest of the week is going to be extremly cold! Safe ice after that!"
