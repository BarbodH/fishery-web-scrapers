290985,joefish,2009-01-12 00:01:00,165,"Question for those of prior knowledge. We are a group of 11 men that fish every year for a week in Sept.  Lately our fishing lodge hasnt been producing as it has in the past. L Nippissing isnt the fishery it once was.  We are in the midst of possibly looking for another venue. Some requirements are:  Accommodations for up to 12  Clean bath, shower, toilet  Kitchen facilities for eating all at once  We like to provide our own food and cook it as well  Boats are needed and must be reliable- gas as well  We have our own bait  We could drive a little further north maybe 7 to 8 hours north of Niagara  We usually go the first full week in Sept. so that the long weekend crowds are gone and there is no boat traffic.  If there are any questions that I may have left out please ask and I'll try and respond ASAP.  We need to get moving on this quickly as time slots fill up fast.  Thanks for your time and input!  Joe"
