291811,Handlebarz,2009-01-13 18:52:00,3790,I was just wondering if anyone knows who Bass_boy7 is as he won the Spinner baits for Ricks auction I thought he might have forgotten that he bid on them if ya know him give him a shout and remind him that he won if he does not want them or cant afford them some one else can have them I would guess I have sent a Pm to him back in Dec with no reply.  Hope someone know him thanks Mike
291820,BassAsin,2009-01-13 19:12:00,806,if no-one can get ahold of him send em' this way lol
291908,Rizzo,2009-01-13 22:14:00,4754,"don't know him, but to hijack your thread does anyone out there know tangledlines? I ""won"" the item they auctioned, sent the cheque out the next week,  and have been waiting for my gift card ever since. Tried a couple of pm's which have gone unanswered. Now I've got Roy looking into things (which is unfortunate, as I'm sure Roy has better things to do)"
291919,Big Cliff,2009-01-13 22:29:00,6899,There seems to be some confusion over the way receipt of payments were supposed to be acknowledged. I suspect that is all that is holding things up as I know TangledLines and you WILL get what you bid on. No idea why you haven't got a response back yet but I am sure you will!
291963,Handlebarz,2009-01-13 23:37:00,3790,  I had the same thing from a couple years back the guy never sent the stuff I know him well and am confused as to why he never did heck soon after that he went awall I know he is still around and fishes alot but he never responds to my email. I talked to Roy and Tj and let them know what happened it is all good now ( I was not up set I know the $$$ went to a good place) but I still wonder why he has done it and still does not come around to fish???
