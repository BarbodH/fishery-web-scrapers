If anyone does, can they tell me if the Lake Wilcox ice conditions are safe to go on? I plan on heading up there some time soon, and wanted to try my luck ice fishing! If anyone knows about the ice conditions on Lake Wilcox, let me know, and if you can, asap, it would be greatly appreciated!  Thanks in advance!"
