291398,Roy,2009-01-12 19:56:00,13728,"I use the Gold+ Emil. The platinum gives points of interest and some 3D overlays....I don't need nor want that. I took this off the Navionics site.  ""The marine Gold+ charts have depth contours, spot soundings, buoy information, obstruction information, show the chart in a paper like view (the water has different shades of coloring), the Xplain feature (which explains different icons on the chart), has major coastal roadways, NavPlanner compatible, enhanced port services & the availability of the free Fish'N Chip (offshore bathymetric information). The marine Platinum charts have the same information as the Gold+ charts but additional advanced ""award winning"" features such as Coastal Points-Of-Interest, Panoramic Port photos, geo-referenced Coast Pilot Books, top-down satellite photo overlay and 3D view for land & water."""

Here's just one site selling them but if you Google Navionics Hotmaps you will find MANY more.  http://www.cabelas.com/cabelas/en/template...requestid=28836

In reply to your question, it depends on a couple of factors: 1) What plotter are you going to use? 2) Where are you fishing? 3) What size kind/size boat? 4) What is your budget?
