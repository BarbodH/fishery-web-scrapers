292011,scugpg,2009-01-14 01:21:00,1373,"Hi all,  I recently bought a new fishfinder and I'm trying to figure out what kind of coverage I'll have below the boat. I was wondering if there is a calculator or chart that I can use to figure out the amount of area I'm covering at a certain depth below the boat. Let me know if you guys are familiar with this.  thanks,  scugog"
292014,Roy,2009-01-14 01:23:00,13728,I'm sure that your user's manual has that info in it....does it?

292037,scugpg,2009-01-14 01:46:00,1373, Hi Roy - I went through it again and didn't see anything. I believe mine has a 20deg cone angle on the transducer if that helps.
292038,Terry,2009-01-14 01:48:00,14456,so in ten ft about 2.4 ft coverage in 150 ft of water about 52 ft of coverage
292039,xeon,2009-01-14 01:51:00,350,"http://s86.photobucket.com/albums/k102/x_x...t=mathrules.jpg Just change the 19degrees to whatever your transducer is, then change the 10feet to the depth you want. Use the formula and your set."
292040,scugpg,2009-01-14 01:52:00,1373, Thanks Terry for the fast response. Much appreciated.
292042,scugpg,2009-01-14 02:00:00,1373,"Stumbled across this as well http://www.fishfinder-store.com/howfifiwo.html   Sonar Beam Coverage Area   Below is a quick reference chart for the area covered by the specific cone angle listed. For example, if you are fishing in 10 feet of water and the cone angle on your transducer is 20 degrees, the area across the bottom is 3.5 feet.  * 20 degrees - 0.35 or roughly 1/3 of depth * 24 degrees - 0.42 or roughly 2/5 of depth * 30 degrees - 0.53 or roughly 1/2 of depth * 40 degrees - 0.72 or roughly 3/4 of depth * 50 degrees - 0.93 or roughly 9/10 of depth * 60 degrees - 1.15 x depth * 70 degrees - 1.4 x depth * 73 degrees - 1.48 x depth * 80 degrees - 1.68 x depth * 90 degrees - 2 x depth * 100 degrees - 2.38 x depth * 110 degrees - 2.85 x depth"
