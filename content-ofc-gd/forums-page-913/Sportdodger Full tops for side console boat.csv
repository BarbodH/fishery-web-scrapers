291767,tinbanger,2009-01-13 17:08:00,1028,"Was wondering if any one has any experiences with this item or has even seen one ?  They are a 'universal' fit full top for side console boats , $1,000 plus tax and shipping they aren't cheap , but if they work as good as they say I wouldn't mind the cost. Made in Winnipeg.MB  My biggest concern would be the 'univeral fit ' part and how they hold up to a 40 MPH run into the wind on GBay in November ?  Appreciate any feedback.  http://www.dufort.mb.ca/products.html  TB"
291791,diggyj,2009-01-13 17:53:00,548,That is a good looking top. I would say that you should check with your boats manufacturer to see if they have a full top for your model.  Sometimes manufacturers don't show something on a website or catalogue but if you ask for something specific they can make it for you or pass you onto someone that has what you are looking for.  I don't see this top being universal for every boat out there. Sure it will keep you somewhat dry and somewhat out of the wind. I would rather have it then not have one at all.  Ask them for feedback from customers with similar boats to yours.
291825,irishfield,2009-01-13 19:20:00,26272,Hate to break it to you Dave... but THAT'S CHEAP !! If it will work grab it before they change their pricing. Get a guarantee that you can return if it doesn't fit/work for you.  Dufort is the mfg of my Lund full top and trailering cover. My drop curtain alone cost $500+
291828,BITEME,2009-01-13 19:27:00,1969,  To bad it wasnt made of kevlar might of saved your fishing rods
291832,irishfield,2009-01-13 19:28:00,26272,Be nice Peter.... LOL
291836,tinbanger,2009-01-13 19:35:00,1028,"But Wayne .. its like buying a sparkplug for a ferrari compared to chevette!  Loaded question ..but are you happy with top/drop curtain they provided ,especially the zippers and hardware ?  I feel better knowing its the same manufacturer . will ask about thier return policy  TB"
291839,irishfield,2009-01-13 19:40:00,26272,I actually had to have my drop curtain custom made... Lund didn't have Dufort do a drop curtain for the Baron.. but Lund quoted $500 for one before stating they didn't have one !  Dufort has been around for a LONG time. Still doing nice work and good quality material Dave (other than the clear vinyl they use is a tad thin). Mine shows no sign of fade or deterioration after 2 full seasons in the sun.
291843,Lowe Rider,2009-01-13 19:44:00,79,"Am I stupid? I found the page and the top but didn't see a price. More, bigger pictures would be nice but I couldn't find them. That would be perfect for my boat. Need that front and top sometimes right Canadian Copper .  LOL"
291844,tinbanger,2009-01-13 19:44:00,1028,Thanks Wayne  Now I just have to save my pennies !  TB
291859,Tom McCutcheon,2009-01-13 20:08:00,627,Just a question on the tops. Does it interfere with a GPS signal if the GPS you use has an internal antenna?
291866,tinbanger,2009-01-13 20:34:00,1028,"Lowe Rider Don't know you , but not a stupid question  I had to contact them via email to get more info ie  quote of  $995 plus taxes and shipping . just waiting now for info on return policy and actual shipping costs .  Hoping this will get my wife out fishing more .  TF -doubt it would effect handheld GPS which works in my car .  TB"
291868,irishfield,2009-01-13 20:37:00,26272,"Click the ""Forms"" link. Has basic pricing to give you an idea."
291879,Lowe Rider,2009-01-13 21:07:00,79,"Thank you, I've been putting the little arrow thingy on everything. Saw the forms thing but could not find that top listed. The one you are looking at is the Black Lund with the Bluebombers sticker on it, right? The price seems very reasonable to me. One size fits all? Boats come in different beams, I wonder how that works?"
291902,tinbanger,2009-01-13 22:05:00,1028,I couldn't find the 'Sportdodger' either . but they did repond to my email ...hence the quoted price of $995 plus tax and shipping  why don't you order one and let me know if you like it   LOL  tb
291960,medmart,2009-01-13 23:29:00,587,That is a nice looking top would look good on my Lund but is there any one local that makes the same style
291997,young_one,2009-01-14 00:41:00,620,"Interesting, the Sportdodger top will definitely make those Early Spring Late Fall BoQ runs much nicer. Universal eh? how about a Tracker Tundra?  I can already see a huge decrease in speed, and like other mentioned, will it stand the test of time?"
292017,Rizzo,2009-01-14 01:27:00,4754,I say slap on a warm coat and a pair of googles...enjoy nature in its fullest
292019,Rizzo,2009-01-14 01:28:00,4754,...of course I mean goggles rather than googles...but if anyone has some spare googles let me know
