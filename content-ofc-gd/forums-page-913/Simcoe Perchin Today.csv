291436,Joey,2009-01-12 21:12:00,9122,
291437,Joey,2009-01-12 21:14:00,9122," That's hilarous Joe.  My cat doesn't like them when they're flopping around either, but sure did like the taste of them.  Such a wuss!!!"
291440,Terry,2009-01-12 21:21:00,14456,Yeah Ron what Joey said
291516,irishfield,2009-01-12 23:04:00,26272,That Ron.. .always the anti - social ! lol
291616,Bly,2009-01-13 03:13:00,1556,"Nice report Joey, loved the cocoa shot.  Haven't got a cat but if anyone even looks like they might be preparing something in the kitchen, Harley is their best friend  hehe"
291637,snag,2009-01-13 04:07:00,1932,"The only thing hotter than that chocolate is you.    Conversely,  I hear you don't drill holes,  You just talk to the ice and it melts.   In addition,  If I was a fish (and I'm glad I'm not)  I would hop into your lap.       Groooooowl."
291641,highdrifter,2009-01-13 04:17:00,2534," Grant, tell the missus to let you out of that crib, it's not for grown-ups, and have her feed ya for god's sake!!  It's making you gooify dude..  Plus I saw her first.."
291644,snag,2009-01-13 04:21:00,1932, Give it up Castrotti!  She's mine!  We swing in this house.   (call me Joey 1-800-HOT-FISH)  
291651,Ron,2009-01-13 04:34:00,1683," Will do Joey, hitting Quinte this weekend, first time in years.    What I said to Joey   Hey Wayne, it was a misunderstanding on my part. I thought you guys were down for the weekend, not just for the day. I called Lloyd up to see where you guys were going for diner and I was gonna meet up with you and Terry then.    my bad, I fell like an"
291726,Joey,2009-01-13 15:11:00,9122,"  Hahahaha, thanks for the laughs this morning guys, you just made my day.  Joey    Ron, good luck at Quinte.  Let me know next time your heading to Simcoe."
291732,Handlebarz,2009-01-13 15:18:00,3790,looks like a great day out there Joey congrats to ya all and thanks for sharing
290945,Joey,2009-01-11 23:16:00,9122,"Met up with Terry out from Gilford today.  It was a tad bit cold this morning    as can be seen by my lovely mug of hot chocolate.    Perch came in schools, on and off all day.  As soon as I heard the boys say here comes some fish, both watching their respective fishfinders, they hit.  Mostly small but there were some keepers.  This is one of the smaller ones - not a keeper, kind of looks angelic in the sunbeams lighting up my clam    Terry thinks he has a nice big jumbo on, then realizes it is bigger than a perch.  Finally he yells out its a pike, and figures he'll not be able to land it on the light tackle he has.  Play by play pics and like a pro, Terry lands her            Paul and Terry yakking.    Me out of my hut for a short moment.    Then Terry gets a nice perch, biggest of the day.    My take home fish.    Terry taking off after a lovely day of fishing.    Got home and started to filet and my cat had other ideas.  He sat there from start to finish and ate about 2 whole perch sushi     He's my best friend now.    The bag on the left is the pike (Thanks Terry   ) and the bag on the right are the perch.    Going to get the pan warming in a minute ready for a fry  Hope we see you out there again next weekend Terry.  Cheers,  Joey"

290949,blakewalk,2009-01-11 23:23:00,86,Great day & nice catch! That must've been a tough pull with that pike on. Your chi-chi has great taste =)
290950,solopaddler,2009-01-11 23:24:00,8605,That pic of the hot chocolate is pretty cool! Looks like a fantastic day Joey  .

290960,medmart,2009-01-11 23:35:00,587,Looks like everyone had a good day but did Paul catch any fish?
290975,Joey,2009-01-11 23:54:00,9122," No, I kept him in line today Wayne, but he did keep calling out your name periodically, then cried like a baby and went into the fetal position.  We talked him through it tho.  Joey"
290977,Joey,2009-01-11 23:54:00,9122," Well he said he did Memart, personally, I didn't see it  Joey"

291248,packrat,2009-01-12 14:02:00,93,Hardly original( the reply that is) but that shot of the hot chocolate is bang on  Thanks for sharing
291256,limeyangler,2009-01-12 14:24:00,5204,Great report joey...start to finish.  The colour on those perch is incredible!  Congrats to your buddy l;anding that snotty rocket on the light gear.  Does your cat bug ya too for scraps?!....lol...mine are all over me as soon as they hear me sharpening a knife...they know what that sound means....lol.
291278,Joey,2009-01-12 15:19:00,9122," Yes Simon, he is relentless with his meowing.  As I mentioned, he ate two perch - sushi style.  He was my best friend the rest of the night too  Joey"
291282,Leecher,2009-01-12 15:36:00,7832,Great report and pics Joey  Loved the play by play pics of Terry landing the gator on light tackle     WTG Terry Great job you guys and thanks for sharing Leechman
291332,Ron,2009-01-12 17:12:00,1683,"You were so close to us Sunday, you could have hit us with a snowball! Never you guys were out there, nor did you know we were.  That is Cupcakes blue clam over your shoulder. My hut is hidden by your beautiful mug. "
291341,Headhunter,2009-01-12 17:44:00,5703,"Thanks for the report Joey! Sunday looked like a prefect day to get out, alas, it was not in the cards for me! I still can't beleive Paul caught a fish though! LMAO! Re the cat... one of the funniest things I recall about my cat was the time I came home from Cooks Bay with a bucket of perch. The fish as the bottom of the bucket were frozen solid and as I was cleaning them, they began to thaw out. Well, my cat came down stairs to see what all that smell was about, climbed up the side of the bucket, just in time for one of the frozen fish, to start flopping in the bucket. I swear that cat jumped 4 feet straight into the air! Heck, I'm still laughing about that one! HH"
291424,douG,2009-01-12 20:45:00,2693,"Very nice shots, Joanne, the one of the cocoa was fabulous.  Nice to see Terry and Paul again with fish too.  Thanks for your post."
