291939,rhare,2009-01-13 22:53:00,387,get a photobucket account and load your photos to photobucket  when you post you just click the little picture box beside the smilies and post the direct link from photobucket  then the pics are in the post.

291945,Leecher,2009-01-13 23:00:00,7832," Mike if you get a Photobucket account, you will be able to set the size that you want your photos from the available options and it'll do it when you upload them automatically.  Give it a try.  Leechman"

292015,ccmtcanada,2009-01-14 01:24:00,7971,"Here's a little tutorial I put together for posting pictures to the forum.  First step...get a photobucket account and upload your pics.  From there you need to copy code...do this by clicking on IMG Code as seen in this picture...   Once you've done that, you paste that into your report.  When you start your post, you'll see the posting window.  Simply paste into the spot you want to see the image...again here's a pic.   If the pictures are too small, click on them...you should be able to read what's on the screen...  Good luck!"
