291993,MJL,2009-01-14 00:30:00,2427,"Definitely a beauty piece.  Let's see some Christening pics!  As far as letting the wifey know, it's always great to stick words like ""discount"" or ""fire sale"" into the sentence. Or ""It costs less than the price of a cup of coffee per day"" without actually taking into account the length of time needed to acquire the equivalent  funds.  It's always worth more than what you paid"
292001,Greencoachdog,2009-01-14 00:51:00,8163,"I don't care how pretty it is... you can still be admonished for it!!!  ... if you're close enough to net them, you're close enough to tail them!!!    I've heard it here before!"
292009,Bly,2009-01-14 01:17:00,1556,  Was wondering WHO was going to say it  ROFL!!!
292012,Greencoachdog,2009-01-14 01:22:00,8163," I hear ya ""net girl""!!!"
292020,danc,2009-01-14 01:29:00,4677,Amazing what you can do with an old tennis racket!!!!
292025,solopaddler,2009-01-14 01:34:00,8605," That is correct unless A: It's freezing cold and you don't want to get your hands wet, B: You're landing the fish alone from a high vantage point that makes tailing difficult, or C: You're landing the fish while standing in waist deep moving water with no place to beach them (tailing is difficult in those situations) and finally D: Shut yer pie hole ya putz!"
292026,BillM,2009-01-14 01:37:00,17367,"Hell, even with two people in decent moving water, tailing a fish is a pain in the ass.  Even with the magical white glove and the grip of death!!!"
292028,kemper,2009-01-14 01:40:00,2232," I always thought that it would be easy to just tail a fish in waist deep water....then I tried it! Hardest thing!  I was fishing a deepish run and there was ice at the banks that was NOT safe to stand on so I waded out and fished in front of it...I know its not the smartest thing to do but sometimes these things happen. Long story short its nearly impossible to tail a fish when its -5 and you are standing waist deep in the water. Ended up pinning it against the ice with my waist then getting it with both hands!  That net is beautiful Mike   Of course the one thats been hanging in my garage for 15 years would work too, the holes in it are too small for a steelie to slip through...   Just kiddin, that thing is a work of art man!"
292051,ironstone74,2009-01-14 02:23:00,201,"Nice Mike, that's a collectable, a thing of beauty!  I would gladly carry it around for you and assist you landing the plethora of Steelhead you catch with apparent ease.  Paul"
292056,solopaddler,2009-01-14 02:30:00,8605,  Arrgh! More fodder for the dawg!!  
292059,ccmtcanada,2009-01-14 02:33:00,7971,Mike...you take obnoxious pills today or something?? LOL
292061,solopaddler,2009-01-14 02:36:00,8605, It could be the fact I havn't slept a second since Sunday night and I'm starting to get twitchy  .
292063,ccmtcanada,2009-01-14 02:42:00,7971, Ok...that explains it...I'll cut you some slack...today....
292065,Greencoachdog,2009-01-14 02:44:00,8163," Well if y'all steelheaders woudn't spout that crap, I wouldn't hear it eh!!!  It is an excellent work of craftsmanship (for a Squash racket... sorry Dan, you were wrong) and would look better hanging on the wall with some vintage fishin' tackle... then you wouldn't have to face the embarrassment of being seen landing a fish with it on the creek!!!  Can I shut up now?"
292070,ccmtcanada,2009-01-14 02:47:00,7971," Yes, please."
292071,TJQ,2009-01-14 02:49:00,7806, thats the truth...  good for you!
292073,solopaddler,2009-01-14 02:49:00,8605," Naw, keep it up. I need something to keep me awake  .  (Just don't call me a steelheader. I hate being lumped in with (most) of those rubes)."
292074,solopaddler,2009-01-14 02:51:00,8605," Thanks guys, that's just what I was thinking this morning."
292076,ccmtcanada,2009-01-14 02:53:00,7971,What I want to know is why can solopaddler use a net and Bly cant?  I mean she is a girl...  I gotta go...hope she doesn't read this thread....
292079,solopaddler,2009-01-14 03:04:00,8605," Don't worry buddy we won't spill the beans, and definitely use a net! Wouldn't want your girlish hands to get chapped!"
292080,ccmtcanada,2009-01-14 03:05:00,7971, I surrender...
292081,solopaddler,2009-01-14 03:09:00,8605," Oh man, I can't stop laughing!! LOL!"
292088,ccmtcanada,2009-01-14 03:16:00,7971,You and me both!!  You've been on a roll today Mike...LOL.
292125,forrest,2009-01-14 05:28:00,1032,  Are these the new G17s that Dr Evil is modelling?
292136,drwxr,2009-01-14 06:08:00,453,"nice net . Mike, if you into stuff like that you will like this:   "
291754,solopaddler,2009-01-13 16:24:00,8605,"For practically my entire life I've always wanted something but could never justify it's purchase: A handmade wooden steelhead net. There's plenty of occasions where beaching a fish is just not feasable and a net is needed though.  Functionally a cheap aluminum version will work just as well, hence my 30 year hesitation.  I finally took the plunge a while back contacting Lloyd Hautajarvi, an amazing craftsman who lives in northern Minnesota near the banks of the Brule river.  The presentation quality net he built for me is in fact his ""Brule"" model.  Made with a truly incredible marbled black ash, it's an absolute work of art!  Check it out, and for those that truly appreciate a fine piece of wood check out the burl on this baby, it's unreal:        It wasn't needed, but it sure is purty, and it'll look great in my steelhead pic's  ."
291757,DRIFTER_016,2009-01-13 16:27:00,10439,Nice Mike. Just remember the warning I gave you about accidently kneeling on the rim as they are not that strong. Don't ask me how I know.
291759,ccmtcanada,2009-01-13 16:31:00,7971,"So, is that net more expensive than my steelhead rod and reel?? Wait...don't answer that....LOL."
291768,highdrifter,2009-01-13 17:15:00,2534,"MMMmmmm...  has a nice, warm feel to it..  very decadent!  thanks for the eye candy dude.  HD"
291769,Ramble,2009-01-13 17:20:00,713,the burl in that maple is impressive. It's a beautiful net.  -Dave

291779,dobee,2009-01-13 17:37:00,301,beautiful for sure!
291783,highdrifter,2009-01-13 17:47:00,2534, half wood eh?!!    woulda been full wood if it was bird's eye..  YYEEEEHHHH HD
291788,Evan Gallimore,2009-01-13 17:49:00,37,Don't even want to know what you paid for that!
291789,jonnybass,2009-01-13 17:51:00,346,Now THAT is the kind of fishing net that you pass down to your grandson.
291803,aniceguy,2009-01-13 18:18:00,1094,tie some roe up and we can give er a spin this week lol
291806,BillM,2009-01-13 18:29:00,17367,"So this was the infamous net you were waiting for  Well worth the wait man, I'm sure it will be put to good use!"
291808,blaque,2009-01-13 18:43:00,2419," Yes you do.........you want to know EXACTLY what he paid for it.   Dont feel bad, its human nature"
291810,DRIFTER_016,2009-01-13 18:52:00,10439, I believe he paid 6 Billion Dollars for it.  
291819,solopaddler,2009-01-13 19:11:00,8605,"   (The monetary cost is minimal compared to the time spent trying to justify it to Joanne. I havn't crossed that bridge yet, but it will come......soon  )"
291822,BassAsin,2009-01-13 19:17:00,806,"that is definatley a gorgeous net!   i made several in shop class in gr. 12 for auction for the shop course to profit, they were all made of white ash and cocabola wood very simple to make until you try to get the mesh on the darn frame!!!!  congrats on the new net knowing you i can picture many shots of gorgeous steel laying beside it!  Matt"
291823,highdrifter,2009-01-13 19:17:00,2534,"I'd say you'll have ta butter her up mister!!  I have a solo Turtle paddle made of black ash myself...  I hate to use it, but it looks better on the side of a cedar strip than on the wall!!  mmmm wooood  HD"
291826,solopaddler,2009-01-13 19:23:00,8605, Do you mean that literally? That could be fun!
