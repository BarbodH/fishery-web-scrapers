Brought back flashbacks from (....shudder....) one of my trips last fall:     A brave local took it upon himself to free the beast from my line:    Moments after that pic was snapped the creature wrestled free and launched itself at my face.  I feel your pain. It was a......horrifying experience."

291991,Joey,2009-01-14 00:28:00,9122,"Wow, a man who can catch a bird and cook it too     Are they hard to gut  How to concur your fears.  BTW, I called that number you left and it referred me to a website called Gullsonaleash.com.  I left you a message there.  Awaiting your reply  Kisses  Joey"
291998,MJL,2009-01-14 00:44:00,2427,"Great post  My sister also has a phobia of birds.  When we were kids, one sharpshooting seagull dropped a bomb right on her head.  She doesn't fish or like the outdoors anymore."
289989,snag,2009-01-09 19:28:00,1932,"I have Laridaphobia If you don't know what it is, you soon will.  It all started when I was a wee lad. First, they seemed friendly. (as seen here with my mom, happily feeding)   Then one day with my Dad, they turned on me  I've been consumed with fear ever since   Don't laugh. Other members here have the same Phobia. We have a support group. Here's GCD when he was a lad. (circa 1932)   Here's CCMT when he was a young lad(?). Pigeons are his thing.  Carole says his night screams are brutal and she can't cook with breadcrumbs anymore.  I understand Cliffy. This is my nocturnal nightmare messenger from hell     The Plan  So I look up some therapists in the phone book and find a radical Master who uses extreme techniques to conquer your worst fear by combining it with your greatest passion. Well obviously mine is fishing!   Under the guidance of my Master I will strive to abolish this debilitating fear  First day of training involved a symbolic consumption of my Nemesis's spirit. He made me eat them all.   Then it's off to the war zone. I fell to my knees but got back up again determined to beat this thing People need signs like this?? Wake up before it's too late.    Where are they? I asked the master  Master says to look for the fat ladies who chum the waters   Or the old ladies who will use children as bait (sickening)   But Master had a friend who was a conjurer or a Seagull Siren, if you will. FreakyFingersFreida  She brought our Nemesis closer   Then out of the heavens or up from HELL they came!!  Master sees a flock of seagulls approaching!    Sorry wrong ones, here they are     Master quickly pulls out his rod, First cast and Master screams, ""BIRD-ON!!""   It's putting up a fight but the Master pulls in his prey  Closer, my precious   Master calms the winged beast with an ancient cross-handed-tiger-style grip.   He removes the bait like a Zen vet   He then reveals to the captive the tool of it's demise   Master is happy because he sees the fear in my eyes melt away He has broken down my walls   Our prey has been warned and released to inform the others of their peril shall they decide to pursue us in the future.   ONE YEAR LATER  I am doing much better.  I got a tattoo to celebrate 1 year of fearlessness   I can read and fall asleep peacefully   In fact, here is a little gem I caught this year all by myself   Though, I am not quite as forgiving as my Master     Conquer your fears.  You can do it,  Yes you can.  S."
289990,fishermccann,2009-01-09 19:35:00,655,"What a great read , thanks for posting. Glad your intervention went well ."
289992,bassman,2009-01-09 19:36:00,384,Hilarious!!!  I experienced the same thing while fishing the shores of Port Colborne a few years back. We had to walk through the nest of thousands of seagulls to get to our spot.  Your post brought back some memories.
289996,Terry,2009-01-09 19:43:00,14456,"well, I am not invisible however I too suffer from Laridaphobia and not only seagulls..  anyway that was funny you have way too much time on your hands"
289997,douG,2009-01-09 19:44:00,2693,"Vintage Snag.  Great stuff, but I gotta say that you are one strange child.  I'm just not sure you're healthy."

290016,Whitespinnerbait,2009-01-09 20:39:00,2038,Well it was a good read until I got to the part where you weren't praticing Catch and Release  
290017,tbayboy,2009-01-09 20:41:00,1497,Always count on Snag for a great story to make me laugh.  Not that Laridaphobia is a laughing matter of course
290022,b2kptbo,2009-01-09 21:10:00,1505,Is that MuskyBill on the far right??? 
290024,misfish,2009-01-09 21:12:00,29133,Very funny read. Whats that side dish in the last pic?

290048,ccmtcanada,2009-01-09 22:23:00,7971,ARGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
290051,crappieperchhunter,2009-01-09 22:28:00,2582,I've been waiting for a post from you.  AHHHHHH ...I've had my New Year's fix now. Should be good for a couple weeks now...before the twitching and drooling starts again!
290060,ccmtcanada,2009-01-09 22:49:00,7971,"Ok...now that the original shock is over (thanks snag for bringing back that horrifying childhood memory), I thought I'd respond.  Birds have destroyed more than a few fishing trips for me...  One time I was shore fishing...I looked behind and like ferocious Velociraptor, they snuck on me...surrounded me....and I had nowhere to go but to jump in the water!!!  Little did I know that these guys were adept at swimming.  Luckily the coast guard was close by to save the day..they found me a kilometer from shore.   Then there was the time Fishnsled took me fishing.  I got out of the car at sunrise...stretched, took a look around and saw this terrifying sight...I spent the rest of the day in the fetal position with the muskie cradle over my head mumbling ""If I cant see them, they cant see me....""   Then, although with best intentions, Big Cliff and my little one shows me how harmless they can be.   Sure...they were ok, but I sure miss my dog.  I'm not 100% convinced those things had nothing to do with it....."
290086,mepps,2009-01-09 23:39:00,1301,When I fished in Mexico I think we caught more birds then fish - great report Grant!
290087,crappieperchhunter,2009-01-09 23:39:00,2582,Did anyone else see the albino pidgeon in Cliff's last post?
290091,JEREMY,2009-01-09 23:44:00,300,I think i will be laughing about this for a few days.Thanx for the chuckle.
