290779,misfish,2009-01-11 17:17:00,29133,"How many zeros  in a billion???  This is too true to be funny...  The next time you hear a politician use the  word 'billion' in a casual manner, think about  whether you want the 'politicians' spending  YOUR tax money.  A billion is a difficult number to comprehend,  but one advertising agency did a good job of  putting that figure into some perspective in  one of it's releases.  A..  A billion seconds ago it was 1959.  B.  A billion minutes ago Jesus was alive.  C.  A billion hours ago our ancestors were  living in the Stone Age.  D.  A billion days ago no-one walked on the earth on two feet.  E.  A billion dollars ago was only  8 hours and 20 minutes,  at the rate our government  is spending it.  While this thought is still fresh in our brain...  let's take a look at New Orleans ....  It's amazing what you can learn with some simple division.  Louisiana Senator,  Mary Landrieu (D)  is presently asking Congress for  250 BILLION DOLLARS  to rebuild New Orleans .. Interesting number...  what does it mean?  A.  Well... if you are one of the 484,674 residents of New Orleans  (every man, woman, and child)  you each get $516,528.  B.  Or... if you have one of the 188,251 homes in  New Orleans , your home gets $1,329,787.  C..  Or... if you are a family of four...  your family gets $2,066,012.  Imagine, now $700 billion bailing out banks in the US.  That's enough to fund complete medical care for every man, woman and child currently alive in the US for 11 years!!  50 billion to bail out the auto industry???  Washington , D.C.  &  Ottawa ON.  < HELLO!!! >  Are all your calculators broken??  Accounts Receivable Tax  Building Permit Tax  CDL License Tax  Cigarette Tax  Corporate Income Tax  Dog License Tax  Federal Income Tax , Federal Unemployment Tax (FUTA)  Fishing License Tax  Food License Tax  Fuel Permit Tax  Gasoline Tax  Hunting License Tax  Inheritance Tax  Inventory Tax  IRS Interest Charges (tax on top of tax)  IRS Penalties (tax on top of tax)  Liquor Tax  Luxury Tax  Marriage License Tax  Medicare Tax  Propert y Tax  Real Estate Tax  Service charge taxes  Social Security Tax  Road Usage Tax (Truckers)  Sales Taxes  Recreational Vehicle Tax  School Tax  State Income Tax  State Unemployment Tax (SUTA)  Telephone Federal Excise Tax  Telephone Federal Universal Service Fee Tax upon Tax  Telephone Federal, State and Local Surcharge Tax  Telephone Minimum Usage Surcharge Tax  Telephone Recurring and Non-recurring Charges Tax  Telephone State and Local Tax  Telephone Usage Charge Tax  Utility Tax  Vehicle License Registration Tax  Vehicle Sales Tax  Watercraft Registration Tax  Well Permit Tax  Workers Compensation Tax  Income Tax  Everything Tax  STILL THINK THIS IS FUNNY???  Not one of these taxes existed 100 years ago...  and our nation was the most prosperous in the world.  We had absolutely no national debt...  We had the largest middle class in the world..  and Mom stayed home to raise the kids.  What happened?  Can you spell 'politicians!'  And I still have to  press '1'  for English.   What the heck happened???"
290787,OhioFisherman,2009-01-11 17:44:00,6623,"If you spend 1,000 dollars a day one million will last almost 3 years, don`t worry about it with a billion spending at the same rate, you won`t live long enough to spend it all.  Pretty sad when the people that write the tax code have to see a tax man to get theirs done? Dang if we had thought this up we might be in Washington or Ottawa?  Great work if you can get it? Make other people give you money so you can spend it? All while wearing a suit and tie and not getting your hands dirty?  Now if they can figure out how to get people that don`t have jobs to pay taxes? A perfect system?"
290789,jediangler,2009-01-11 17:46:00,1923,Very interesting. Maybe capitalism doesn't work. At least not for 99.9% of us. That's not to say that anything will change. Those who make the decisions aren't going to mess up a profitable (for them) situation. The gates in the gated communities will get taller and they will be guarded by more and more armed security.

290829,forrest,2009-01-11 19:52:00,1032,A buddy o fmine told me that he has caught a zillion fish.  How much is that?
290844,blakewalk,2009-01-11 20:39:00,86,"If Jesus caught 10 000 fish in a day, and I caught zero today, then a billion fish is an eternity away. haha! Interesting comment JediAngler, I agree that capitalism betrays each and every working person for the benefit of the few greasy buggers on parliament hill."
290850,kemper,2009-01-11 20:44:00,2232,"Interesting, but its how the world is. Fact, not fiction and probably not going to change. Capitalism works, you just gotta go after what you want."
290853,diggyj,2009-01-11 20:47:00,548,"Very interesting read, but also very scary when you think about some of those numbers mentioned."
290864,Vtucciarone,2009-01-11 20:59:00,38,Imagine we were all billionairs. Who would do all the work? (Politicians) NOT!!!!!!!!!!!
290866,Guest skeeter99,2009-01-11 21:09:00,0,"a billion dollars  is nothing   it is just a number on a peice of paper  similar to all our money these days just a number on paper   dont worry about it u will die young  the government can just print more or have a technical glitch and everything is paid   besides the U.S. already is in debt trillions let alone billions   The Current national debt owed by the USA is well over 8 TRILLION dollars, approximatly $8,128,207,427,249 and RISING. But don't take my word for it, check out the constantly updated and award winning USA Debt Clock.  So, with the current USA population at about 295,734,134, a quick division tells me this works out to $27,484 USD for every man, woman, and child in the United States. Of course, by the time you read this it'll probably be over $27,500 per capita...  In comparison, Canada's national debt is a ""mere"" $805 billionish (or $690,726,990,157 USD), AND FALLING. Keep in mind that we have a much smaller population, sitting at around 32,805,041, so our per capita debt load, coverted at today's exchange rate of $1 CAD = $0.863408 USD is around $21,055 USD/Canadian, and, thankfully, falling."
290870,diggyj,2009-01-11 21:13:00,548,"Every player on the Toronto Maple Leafs would get paid more than 45 million. Wow, what a team we would have then. Come on MLSE, start coughing up some dough!"
290872,Bernie,2009-01-11 21:18:00,3190,"Capitalism does work. Not being operarated proper though. It's just that bailout's are not part of the system. If your business fails, you shut it down, If you can't afford it, save until you do, work a full day for a full days pay."
290894,holdfast,2009-01-11 22:05:00,1813,"Thats so us Hosers lend, oops give money for these Guys.  Im sure the Pay Guide doesnt end there.  Ya think Ball Players just might take a pay cut?  http://money.cnn.com/2007/04/05/news/companies/ford_execpay/"
291467,jonnybass,2009-01-12 22:09:00,346,"As for that list of taxes - I bet not one person here has a problem with paying the fishing license tax.  I'm sorry, please remind me why I have to pay to fish?"
291477,misfish,2009-01-12 22:24:00,29133, SO YOU CAN
291481,jonnybass,2009-01-12 22:27:00,346,"Yeah, but I used to fish before the tax."
291523,OhioFisherman,2009-01-12 23:20:00,6623,"johnny you pay to fish to cover enforcement fees, restocking programs, probably to clean up after some er sportsmen?"
291571,Markystang,2009-01-13 01:01:00,131,BINGO!!
291575,Daplumma,2009-01-13 01:12:00,1961,What is the definition of a billion?Is it a thousand million or a million million?Depends on where you live. Joe
291584,douG,2009-01-13 01:44:00,2693,"In these here parts, a billion equals a thousand million.  10^3 = thousand 10^6 = million 10^9 = billion 10^ 12 = trillion 10^15 = quadrillion.  Don't worry, we'll get there soon.  The notation I used means 1 followed by that number of zeroes. Hope this hleps."
291610,hammercarp,2009-01-13 03:01:00,964,Were we the most prosperous nation a hundred years ago? Did the middle class even exist? I know that in 1909 Ford came out with the model T and so here we are today. Oh and it was one of the 50 worst cars of all time a real lemon.
