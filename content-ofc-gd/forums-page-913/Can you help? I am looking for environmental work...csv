I possess an ecosystem management and a fish and wildlife management diploma (attained april 2008), and unfortunately, I cannot seem to find work....  If you, or somebody you know works in the environmental field and is looking for somebody to help out, work, volunteer etc (it doesnt matter)....I am looking to network and meet new people in my field of work, along with getting some hands-on field experience.  My preference would be something within 30mns of Toronto, but would be willing to travel further on occasion, pending the type of duties I would perform.    Thank you for your time!  -Mark"

If any significant projects come by soon, I will certainly post here to let you know- although it would only be contract work (still good for the resum√©, however).  Keep up the search! In the mean time, you might wish to check with some of the firms found on this site."
