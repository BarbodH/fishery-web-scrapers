292050,snag,2009-01-14 02:23:00,1932,"Baracuda, hmf! Indeed.  Suuuuuuuuure Ryan whatever you say  Tell the truth,  Ginny had a craving for fresh sushi!!  What a gal, she saved you a $100 japanese dinner that way!   Pure envy from me to you!"
290372,The Urban Fisherman,2009-01-10 20:09:00,2050,"Long story short, Dave phoned me up a few months back to let me know we'd be shooting a Bonefish show in the Bahamas, and wanted to know if my wife would like to tag along for the shoot!    Better friends and employers you will not find!!! Sunday morning Dave, Myself, Richie (other camera operator) and our wives headed to the Bahama's for 4 nights @ Emerald Palms Resort for some world class Bone fishing.  We shot an awesome show, and enjoyed a couple days away from the cold.  It was the first time either myself or Ginny had been on a trip like this, truly a trip of a lifetime!   Bone fish are hands down, pound for pound the hardest fighting fish I've ever seen.  A 6 pounder will spool you with little effort!  They just never give up...   Ginny was fighting this guy and a barracuda smashed it on the way in, ripping it in half!   The next day I did a little bit of surf fishing while Ginny walked the beach looking for shells for our daughter.   I was just  throwing a powerbait twister tail on a jig, and there was plenty of these little guys to keep me busy.     Then reality set in and we had to head back to Canada thursday morning.  So friday I spent the day catching up on some computer work, and at the crack of dawn this morning I hit a local reservoir for some perch action.  By the time I got bait and a coffee it was 8 a.m. and the fishing was on fire right off the bat.  I got 11 keepers before 9 a.m. then it died down and I only managed 1 more keeper and a couple OOS largies by 10 a.m. So I packed it in and was home with dinner by 10:30.  First Ice fish of 2009 and healthy 11.5 incher.   Most productive bait was a small buckshot tipped with a minnow.  Bounced off bottom in 18 to 23 FOW.   And tonight's dinner....   Good luck out there and be safe.  I found a few spots on the lake that only had 2 inches of good clear ice with 6 inches of slushy frozen stuff on top.  Cheers, UF"
290380,Grimace,2009-01-10 20:23:00,2020,Wicked.   I would say you have an awesome boss.   The experience must have been enhanced greatly with having your wife invited.    Great perch as well.

290479,Moosebunk,2009-01-11 00:03:00,3970,Fantastic UF.  Always enjoy the far and away reports no matter what but this was made even better by having both success with the bones and the company of your wife.  Congrats to you two.  Thanks for the report.   And btw... Dave who and what show?
290485,Dano,2009-01-11 00:12:00,719,"Ha ha, thats awesome. Thanks for the report."

290673,The Urban Fisherman,2009-01-11 13:17:00,2050," Thanks Solo - I know I'm a lucky man, at work and at home.... and can't wait for the new baby come april!   Hey Moosebunk - I know it wasn't as extensive as your remote reports, but I've got a lot on the go right now so had to keep it short.... I work for Dave Mercer on Facts of Fishing THE SHOW.  I just don't want to sound like a broken record so I don't repeat it all the time when I do reports... As I said in my original post, him and his wife are awesome friends and employers.  They'll do anything for anyone without asking for anything in return.  Cheers, UF"
290696,Greencoachdog,2009-01-11 14:35:00,8163,Great report and pics Urby!!!  That Dave is really a stand-up kinda guy eh!!!  I'd have had to cut off a chunk of that bitten Bonefish and thrown it back out there to see if Mr. 'Cuda was still hungry!!!
290711,limeyangler,2009-01-11 14:56:00,5204,"Great report!   Ahhhhh....gonna have to call my brother in law and use his place in Antigua some time soon.   Never caught a bone fish myself but the exact same bite off thing happened to me in antigua. I was fishing the mangrove flats....had waded half a mile out into the bay....was pulling in a 3 foot barracuda...when somthing ripped into it, lol...pulled in a 1 1/2 foot barracuda....i felt a bit vulnerable standing waste high in the water in the middle of the bay a good 1/2 mile from land with a 3 foot baraacuda eater nearby...lol.  Thanks for sharing   and congrats to you and Ginny for the baby.  Simon"
290756,The Urban Fisherman,2009-01-11 16:17:00,2050," The guide and I did go in after it!  but by the time we got a picture of Ginny holding the half eatin' bone he had peaced out.    Tell me this gore shot of the bone wouldn't look appealing to a cuda! lol   Here's some scenery shots I dug up to.  What a place man, I'd definitely recommend Emerald Palms for anybody looking to do some flats fishing in the Bahamas!        "
290800,tibbs,2009-01-11 18:02:00,650,Great Pics!

291106,ccmtcanada,2009-01-12 03:11:00,7971,"Wow...great report Ryan!  Your wife at 6 months pregnant looks stellar!!  It's awesome you got some fishing in during the time down there...as much as it's hard work what you do, it looks like it can be pretty darned exciting at times too.  I literally felt the cold weather when the report switched from sunny and warm to the ice report!!! LOL"
291520,Markystang,2009-01-12 23:12:00,131,Thanks for the great report!
