291535,Greencoachdog,2009-01-12 23:39:00,8163,"Like I mentioned in a couple previous threads, we've been getting an enormous amount of rain down here (we needed it). I fish Lake Neely Henry on the Coosa River, it's the 2 lake down in a chain of 6 lakes. Logan Martin is the 3rd lake and it has been about 8' above normal for this time of year. I've been waiting for the water on Henry to clear up and for most of the debris to be washed away, today I couldn't wait any longer. It was a fairly decent day weather wise, light winds and a high of 55*F.  I got to the lake at about 10 a.m and was kinda disappointed at my first look at the lake. The water was still chocolate milk and still a large amount of debris in the lake. Leaves, small tree branches, large branches, big logs, and litter.  I said ""what the heck, I'm already here"" and launched the boat.  The first thing I had to do was run the gauntlet!!!  They were everywhere!!!  It brought back the hellish nighmares of my childhood!!!   This one stood in the same spot all day and watched me... I just knew he was goin' to attack any second!!!  ... but he didn't! *whew!*  I took this pic for Bernie, he mentioned in another thread he'd like to see a boat and some wake!   Like I said the day was nice, but my confidence was low. The cold muddy water and dropping water levels are just not condusive to good fishin' (catching).  I just baited up one Sabiki rig with big shiners (2 1/2"") and drug it around the lower end of my favorite creek. I drug that thing up and down the creek for 2 hrs. and not even a sniff. Kept checking the shiners to see if any had gone AWOL or were dead... nope!... everybody was still alive and accounted for.  I had lulled myself into a daze daydreaming of fish caught and days gone by when I was rudely interrupted by a ""rattle rattle"" and then a zzzzzzzz zzzzzz zzzzzz, I thought to myself ""what in the hell is all that racket about??? Then I looked over to my rod in the holder and saw it bent over double with the top half in the water... then thout to myself ""damn! snagged!!!"" Then saw the rod strt to jump and more drag peel zzzzzz zzzzz! I said to myself ""Wake up dumbass, you've got a fish!!!"" ( I have to get pretty stern with me sometimes!  )  Grabbed the rod outta the holder and feel good weight!!! Something was heading for the bottom!!! About a 5 minute battle ensued and I finally got this thing to the net!!!  YUP!!! A gigantic World record Bullhead!!!... if I had kept him for the record, it wouldn't have been for the money... or the fame... it would've been for the Groupies!!!... but then I thought about the    whippin' I'd have to tote if Ol' Yeller ever even caught me TALKIN' to a groupie... so I let him go, after playing the picture takin' game. I know how some of these radioactive brainwave fish are around these parts, so I took three pics (returning Mr. Gigantic World Record Bullhead to the livewell after each pic)... Well, after the 2nd pic... Mr. Gigantic World Record Bullhead got tired of playin' the picture game and proceeded to latch onto my thumb and rotate himself thricely in the livewell when I grabbed him for the third pic... mangling my thumb not unlike a baby Muskrat on meth would do!!!  ... but that's ok, I prolly deserved it!... I wear my fish battle scars proudly!!!  After that all was quiet again... until I decided to eat lunch... as soon as I grabbed my bag of tater chips the rod went off again.... this time, much smaller and much more worthless.  That's right! A baby Sheepie!  After that... NOTHING!!!... hung around for an hour or so and decided to pack it in calling it a slow but surprisingly good day!  Stay tuned for your next softwater fix!!!"
291539,Sinker,2009-01-12 23:45:00,8692,Thats a nasty ole cat right there!!!   The fish are nice too  Sinker

291545,Roy,2009-01-12 23:57:00,13728,"That is one BIG bullhead, Glen! And here I thought it was customary to use a boga on those things.  Another few days and you'll have clear water again. A great outing for you for sure. What size hooks on the sabiki?  BTW, did the Giant World Record Bullhead show up on the quadrabeam?  HEY! Wait a minute....you took 3 pics and showed us ONE!

291560,Greencoachdog,2009-01-13 00:37:00,8163, I don't own a Boga and was very lucky to avoid the deadly stinging whiskers on that brute... they could killa horse yanno!!!  Sabiki rig hook size is #14 Japanese or #2 U.S. ... but high carbon steel Hayabusa Rig hooks!!!... they don't bend... they dont break!!!  I got the Gigantic World Record Bullheads nasty    before the quadrabeam had a chance to hit him!!!     If y'all will look closely... I'm wearing my Ontario Fishing.net hat!!!    Tourney is underway Jack!!!
