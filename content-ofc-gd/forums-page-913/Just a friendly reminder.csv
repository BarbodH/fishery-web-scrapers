291929,misfish,2009-01-13 22:37:00,29133,"So please dont leave yer pets out to long. Thier little paws will get cold and they will be very uncomfortable. If you all have a stray that comes around,give it a box with an old blanket or towel to curl up in.  This is what my aunt K did,and I have seen first hand,how they show thier thankful effection back."
291946,brkygetr,2009-01-13 23:01:00,425,"Well said... I'll second that. It's bloody cold out...remember your friends.  it was -39 here when I was makin my coffee this morn...no wind or chill, just COLD!"
292060,snag,2009-01-14 02:34:00,1932,"Good reminder Misfish,  I actually went to Value Village and bought a used coffee/tea cup warmer and placed it under my cats blanket in the garage.  Works like a charm. Perfect temp. not too hot."
292069,TJQ,2009-01-14 02:47:00,7806," Carefull!! Monique did that with me, and that was 20 some odd years ago.. lol"
292095,bigugli,2009-01-14 03:43:00,6138,"My wife did that 12 years back and we wound up, a week later, with two stray mommas and 15 kittens taking over the house."
292102,danc,2009-01-14 03:56:00,4677,"Good advice Brian. It's looking like the coldest week of the winter so far up here. -34, -37, -34 are the expected lows for the next 3 nights. Good thing I'm on workers compensation at the moment and I get to stay in bed through all of this. But then again, having something drilled out of your eyeball isn't much fun either. Back to the eyeball specialist tomorrow morning."
292111,DRIFTER_016,2009-01-14 04:22:00,10439,I love it when southerners say its really cold. Our average temps for the last 8 WEEKS have been -30 The warmest it has been is -27 and the coldest was -46 with wind chills to -56. Couple that with 5 hours of daylight then you can complain.  This weekend is supposed to be completely different with highs near 0.  And yes bring your pets in out of the cold. Mines asleep on his couch right now.
292112,irishfield,2009-01-14 04:24:00,26272,"You talkin about them lap dogs Brian..... I couldn't get my 108 lb lab to come in when it was -40. Couldn't drag him in... he was content curled up in a snow drift, drinking out of his water dish with the aquarium heater going full blast in it ! lol"
292113,danc,2009-01-14 04:26:00,4677," Similar temps here. Just a few degrees difference. It really doesn't matter if it's -20, 30, 40 or 50. You'll never see GCD without a shirt in those temps."
292120,KelfuN,2009-01-14 05:03:00,246,the winds are really picking up now...  my car was frozen solid with the melted snow from the morning... it was tough scrapping the ice off  i heard thursday is suppose to be even colder?!
292142,outllaw,2009-01-14 11:21:00,1232,now  im actaually glad i fell thru the ice rescuing my jack russel last week.. in this freeze it would be over. bye the way straw is a better thung then blankets. it wicks away the wetness.
292174,misfish,2009-01-14 14:27:00,29133,"Little cuddles made 4 steps out the door this morning,had a quicky and back to the pillow. LOL Dang thats nippy out there this morning."
292181,Governator,2009-01-14 14:56:00,879,"Yea my little dog scratches to go out, I open the door than she sits there thinking ""Uhmm... what the hell is this?""  lol"
292210,irishfield,2009-01-14 16:23:00,26272, Very true George... only issue is straw mites. Went thru that a few times unfortunately with them cycling off the poor dog until the vet woke up and asked if we had hay in the dog house.
292226,blakewalk,2009-01-14 17:10:00,86,"Good day to work from home, thats for sure- especially considering how the trains were running over 85 minutes late this morning."
292352,outllaw,2009-01-14 22:13:00,1232,wow straw mites. they gotta be tough. irishfield they must be winters fleas. i just learned something new t-day.
292366,misfish,2009-01-14 22:39:00,29133,"  Na, the flies came from Wayne,when he was curlling up with the pooch to keep him warm."
