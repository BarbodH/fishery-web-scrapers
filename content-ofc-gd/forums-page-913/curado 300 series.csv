290374,workwear,2009-01-10 20:10:00,592,was up at bass pro this mornin and was checking out the curado's.....the 300 series is on special for 189.99 preity decent deal as this reel  regularly retails at 299.99   cheers peter
290387,OhioFisherman,2009-01-10 20:34:00,6623,"Good price I guess, even in the US 2009 catalog it is listed at 249.99. Might be a lot of sales this year if buying slows."
292172,bucktail,2009-01-14 14:25:00,1857,"Good deal. I love mine, use it for bucktails and big spinnerbaits for musky. The low profile is alot easier on my hands since I have small hands."
292179,trapshooter,2009-01-14 14:51:00,1234,So far mine has performed well as a 'light duty' muskie reel.  Bucktails and topwater.  That's a great price too.
292187,diggyj,2009-01-14 15:07:00,548,"Wow, that's a great deal. Do you know if they still had them in stock? Might go for a drive at lunch to pick one up."
