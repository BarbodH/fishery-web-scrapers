For the last couple of months I've been incredible busy with work, the Christmas holidays and several trips to the doctors and specialists.  Great that work has been going so well in these tough times and I'm very thankful for that.  The holidays were very nice with the normal hustle and bustle of the season.  Santa was pretty good to me as well.  The not so great stuff has been my health. Been back in for more eye surgery (Right eye) with the left to be done next Monday.  Getting use to that after several procedures.  Last fall when I had my annual physical the doctor thought I should have an ECG done because it had been a few years.  Heart disease runs on both sides of my family.  The ECG had some irregularities to it so I was sent in for an echocardiogram which came back OK.  From there I was sent to a cardiologist and had a stress test done which was labeled as abnormal.   The cardiologist said it wasn't bad but something wasn't right.  So this Friday I'm going in for an angiogram to get a closer look at the ticker and arteries.  I'm guessing on the brighter side of this that whatever it is, they've caught it early enough to do something about it before it causes any real damage.  Or they'll say it's nothing to worry about and go fishing.    Hopefully I'll have that answer after the procedure this Friday.  Hoping to do some catching up here while I recover this weekend.  Take care and tightlines."
