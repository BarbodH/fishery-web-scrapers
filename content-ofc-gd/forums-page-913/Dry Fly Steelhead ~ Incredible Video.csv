288695,MarcusDiGiovanni,2009-01-07 00:36:00,182,When does a rainbow become a steelhead?
288703,blakewalk,2009-01-07 00:45:00,86,"I'd love to see them rise like that on the Grand; but still, I wouldn't bet on a dry fly."
288726,solopaddler,2009-01-07 01:16:00,8605," True steelhead are anadromous, spending their lives in the salt and ascending the rivers to spawn. Our steelhead here in the great lakes are mistakenly called anadromous. To be really anal about it they are in fact potamodromous, meaning they live there lives in large freshwater lakes and migrate up our tributary streams to spawn. Anadromous or potamodromous the common element is these fish we call steelhead live their lives in large bodies of water and migrate into streams and rivers to spawn. A much different animal than a river fish born and bred. Trout that live there entire lives in a river key on whatever food source is readily available. In most cases insect life of some type...Obviously this makes them easy to catch on dry flies. Migratory fish on the other hand have lived most of their lives roaming the wide open depths chasing baitfish. Yes, you can catch them on flies quite readily, BUT most of the best fly patterns represent eggs or minnows. Subsurface nymph patterns are also a deadly and subtle bait. For whatever reason steelhead are just not predisposed to hit insects on the surface... I believe the ones that do hit dry flies have had that feeding instinct imprinted on them as smolts in the river before they migrated out to the big water to become ""steelhead"" and frankly it's just not that common a thing..."
288727,forrest,2009-01-07 01:16:00,1032, steelhead are rainbow that are not permanent residents of the river.......its kind of a grey area.  For around here the steelhead would be those rainbow that hang out in Lake Ontario.  They have more fight due to all the exercise they get in the lake.  From what I read people debate about steelhead vs rainbow  forrest
288748,pirlo06,2009-01-07 01:46:00,17,"great video!!! going fly fish'n tomorrow for sure!!!! supposed to be a little warmer maybe a little rain, sounds like a perfect day!!!! thanks again for that video!!!"
288758,tibbs,2009-01-07 01:56:00,650,Cool video!  I'd sure would like to see that one day.
288770,DMASSE,2009-01-07 02:18:00,420,"I had the privledge to dry fly fish for steelies in early winter with RICK WORWOOD (FFF MAster) and BILL SPICER (FFF MASTER) and we ALL got some good hits on WHITE MILLERS.  They hatch when the temps are starting to drop but not freezing.   Penn.  rivers and with good colour water.    I even say a guy get a chromer on a hopper-dropper ,  but i think it was taken when the hopper was being dragged under the water...  Dave"
288772,trapshooter,2009-01-07 02:23:00,1234,I heard a lot about Smithers last winter in BC.  A girl I talked to had spent the entire fall there chasing steel everyday.  She said they had 5 fish in the 30 lb class........
288774,kemper,2009-01-07 02:25:00,2232,I have watched this 5 times today now.  Just unreal.

288883,BillM,2009-01-07 13:14:00,17367,"Mike, that's a wicked video man.  What do you think those fish rising on the Elk were doing?  Seemed to be quite a few of them breaking the surface...  I'm getting the itch again, lol"
289051,jdmls,2009-01-07 18:26:00,575, Can I have her name and # ..... BOX and STEEL are a combo that weaken me at the knees
289109,kennyman,2009-01-07 20:19:00,737,"Great video. Now about Gord Deval. His book Fishing for Brookies, Browns and Bows : The Old Guy's Complete Guide to Catching Trout was great. Anyone interested in this thread should read this book."
289201,Rich,2009-01-07 22:42:00,3927,"I watched a guy get one on a dry fly on the Grand once.. thought it was cool, didn't know it was a rarity"
291625,Paulus,2009-01-13 03:29:00,522, Thanks for that bud. I think I've watched it about 20 times now. And I don't even fly fish!!!  lol!  p.-
291635,snag,2009-01-13 04:01:00,1932,I give up  (and I haven't even started!)
288580,MJL,2009-01-06 21:54:00,2427,"Fantastic video.  Read lots about waking flies on top for steelhead but not so much about dead drift drifting them.  I’ve had one mind blasting experience with steelhead on top. Not exactly with a dead drift dry fly but on the Friday before 2004 May long weekend, I got one fish around 4lbs on a waked dry fly on the Humber. By far one of my most vivid memories of all time.  I was off school for the summer and had no car so the Humber was one of the few places I could get to by TTC. Fished the river 4 straight days (Tues – Fri). The last 2.5 days were spent trying to get one on top. Managed to do it on the last day (Friday morning around 10:30am). The fish fell to a size 8 'wake n' bake' fly with a flat piece of yellow craft foam tied to the back of it for additional buoyancy - Pretty much looks like a muddler minnow with a piece of yellow foam on it (saw it on a website).  1st was spent float fishing.  Got 1 steelhead around 6lbs, several dozen suckers and lots and lots of chub on trout worms. Saw several steelhead in the run roll on top every so often and one exploded on a dish washing sponge floating down river.  2nd day I had fly gear with me (8wt + floating line).  Swung flies most of the day and beyond snagging a sucker in the head with an egg sucking leech I blanked. Again saw several fish (probably the same fish from the previous day rolling on top.  Tried drifting unweighted leech patterns without any split shot on the line to get them to hit but that didn’t work – The flies also sunk.  That evening I went to the tackle shop to pick up a few dry flies which might work for dry fly steelheading and got some basic advice on how to fish them (I had no experience whatsoever with dry flies).  3rd day water was low and clear.  Forced myself to use only the flies I bought the previous night and left the split shots, sink tips and wet flies at home.  Tried dry fly fishing with 3 different flies - Small Bomber, red and yellow Chernobyl ant and muddler minnow soaked with floatant (which still ended up sinking after a while).  I tried dead drifting and waking them but hooked nothing and saw nothing roll for the whole day.  Went back to the tackle shop for some fly tying materials to make my own dry flies.  4th day.  Got to the river around 7:30am.  Tried swinging flies and got nothing for the first 2hrs.  Saw a few suckers jump straight out of the water but no signs of steelhead. Switched up to the fly I tied myself. Around 10:30am on one drift I see a V-wake heading upstream and didn’t think much of it till a few seconds later, I saw a flash of silver torpedo itself across the surface and connect with my fly.  I was so awestruck I initially didn’t set the hook nor did I realize I had loose fly line tangled around my leg and the fighting butt of my rod.  After 20 seconds of sheer panic of getting my situation sorted; finally realizing that I probably should set the hook; having my digital camera fall into the drink when it slipped from my wader side pocket (which as I explained to my dad was the reason why it no longer works as well) and 4 minutes of battling, I get my prize to hand.  I asked a nearby dog walker who watched the whole thing unfold to take a few pics with her cell phone camera (she promised to send me the pics but never did).   That was the one and only time I’ve ever caught something with a dry fly.  I’ve also heard a few stories at the local tackle shop of steelhead falling to dry flies on the Saugeen and Maitland from guys who were chasing browns and brookies – Saw the pics too of 5-6lb fish with the flies in their yap.  They told me it was a total blast on the 4wt!"
288585,solopaddler,2009-01-06 22:05:00,8605,"  Now that's cool, and on a fly you tied yourself no less  ."
288620,douG,2009-01-06 22:54:00,2693,This sounds like the steelhead equivalent of topwater fishing for muskie or bass.
288691,forrest,2009-01-07 00:32:00,1032, I think it sounds more like the chess clubs equivalent to capturing all your opponents pieces with just knights (its the geekiest thing that requires brains I can thing of right now).  You guys are creek geeks.  OK...I give...I would have thought that rainbow could be caught this way so why is this such a special thing?  what is the difference between the rainbows and other river fish?  Forrest
