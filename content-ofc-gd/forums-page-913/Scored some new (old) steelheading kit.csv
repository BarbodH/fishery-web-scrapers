A rare find (at least for me), I picked up 5 new Olympique spinners from the local tackle shop.  Found them tucked away in a dark corner of a reel case – They were the last ones.  The shop-keep gave me a good discount to take them off his hands figuring that no one else would ever buy them.    I can’t remember the last time I saw these for sale in shops.  I actually can’t remember ever seeing them for sale anywhere.  A few of the older anglers told me they used to get them back in the 70’s (before my time).  My uncle Mark gave me 1 of these spinners along with a few other lures for my 5th birthday.  I caught my first steelhead the following spring on the spinner when my uncle took me to the Ganaraska to fish for some silver bass – Certainly a welcome surprise and no doubt the moment that got me hooked into steel.  Over the years I’ve purchased less than a handful old and tarnished Olympique spinners off fisherman who no longer use hardwear (or gave up the game completely). I always seem to have great success with these lures…At least till they end up in snags.  Can’t wait to use these babies, I’m sharpening them at this very moment!"
