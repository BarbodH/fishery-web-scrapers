287592,rbaquial,2009-01-04 06:58:00,968,"Hey Guys,  Just curious on what NF means? I'm a n00bi3!  Thanks!"
287593,HTHM,2009-01-04 06:59:00,4082,NF = not fishing.
287594,rbaquial,2009-01-04 07:02:00,968, Quick and simple -  Thanks Bud!
287774,Radnine,2009-01-04 22:46:00,1538,"Wait a tic, you don't get off that easy....DUH! No I'm just kidding. What I want to know is what does it mean when someone says ""BUMP""? Jim"
287777,Gerritt,2009-01-04 22:50:00,6129,"they are just ""bumping"" the thread back up to the top...  G"
287778,kemper,2009-01-04 22:53:00,2232,NF = not fishing OOS = Out of season bump = thread to top TTT = same as bump BOQ = bay of quinte BOG = scugog   that should cover some of the ones you will see here often
287785,Radnine,2009-01-04 23:25:00,1538,"Thanks guys, for the definitions! So, just so I have this straight, If someone wanted to refresh a subject and bring it to the top of the thread list they would reply with ""BUMP""? Also (while everyone is in such an accommodating mood) why is Scugog known as the BOG? Thanks in advance, Jim"
287836,kemper,2009-01-05 00:43:00,2232, Ever fished scugog?  That will answer your question
287839,JeffBornFishin,2009-01-05 00:47:00,260,  Thats why all those new million dollar homes on the east side have 300 foot docks  If you want a laugh go to google maps and use the satellite view.  Take a look at Scugog
287845,ccmtcanada,2009-01-05 00:54:00,7971,Most of the mid to south end of scugog is just a big old shallow weed bed.  More of a weed carpet actually.  Hence the Bog.
291944,rbaquial,2009-01-13 22:58:00,968, Thanks Kemper!!
291957,Beans,2009-01-13 23:16:00,3339,"Before Mr. Purdy got permission (200 some odd years ago) to build a dam for his mill and flood the land it was mostly a swamp (bog) with a small river flowing through it...  The area that was called Purdy's Mill is now known as Lindsay, Ontario..."
291967,Handlebarz,2009-01-13 23:42:00,3790,The part I like best about BUMP or TTT it is not used here much which is great once in a blue moon some one will use it but for the most part if a thread has died its gone.  On the other side we are just a little goofy around here and will use some stupid saying or add something to a thread to get it BTTT I have been on some boards where most threads are filled with that BUMP and TTT crap.
291971,Rizzo,2009-01-13 23:52:00,4754,how about rotflmao...or rotfLMAO...or (nobody slap me on this one) what's his name
291977,kickingfrog,2009-01-14 00:00:00,8333,LMAO - Laugh(ing) my   off ROTFLMAO - Rolling on the floor laughing my   off  Took me months to figure some of these out.
291982,solopaddler,2009-01-14 00:13:00,8605,"Okay your question was answered, now exactly what is a ""noobi3"" LOL!"
291986,diggyj,2009-01-14 00:20:00,548,Here's a pic of some of those monster docks on the BOG.... 
292035,Rizzo,2009-01-14 01:44:00,4754,"hahaha somebody censored me to read ""What's his name""...either way, it was an acronym for do I...."
292090,River Rat,2009-01-14 03:29:00,161,"was it Monty Python that tried to cross he ""BOG of eternal stench""?.......they couldn't do it either"
