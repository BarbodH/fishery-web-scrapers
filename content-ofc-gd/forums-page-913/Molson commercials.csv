290423,Sandbag,2009-01-10 21:52:00,533,I laugh my A$$ off evrytime I see that new Canadian commercial.  Awesome writers.  Cheers  Craig
290451,Mark Kulik,2009-01-10 23:08:00,348,I enjoyed them a lot more before they shut down the plant right after I moved up north!
290482,Greencoachdog,2009-01-11 00:10:00,8163,These 2 are my favorite!!!    
290487,bigugli,2009-01-11 00:19:00,6138,Love the killer beaver
290528,rob v,2009-01-11 01:43:00,535,Chas'in beaver - every red blooded Canadian's favorite thing to do !!!  eh ?
290538,TennesseeGuy,2009-01-11 01:57:00,957, I hang out in a community where only half the population is into Chas'in bearer.
290680,crabbs,2009-01-11 13:33:00,14,I find they have there moments but can be a little patronizing and self agrandizing just like Don Cherry all in the name of making money...  These are pretty funny      More      
290740,Daplumma,2009-01-11 15:50:00,1961,The ones with the Proclaimers singing are great.
290916,holdfast,2009-01-11 22:43:00,1813,"Very Funny commercials, up there with the Beer commercials during the International Hockey games, speaking of which they dont play anymore.  I guess they were to Racist or too un Canadian eh Crabb."
291462,jonnybass,2009-01-12 21:55:00,346, Huh?
291562,Markystang,2009-01-13 00:38:00,131,"The ""Joe Canadian"" ones always made me feel warm and fuzzy and real patriotic. Great commercials, but the beer gives me the squirts, lol!"
291572,holdfast,2009-01-13 01:02:00,1813, I only found one    I couldn't find the Swedish Player about to get stabbed in the shower by a Team Canada Player with a Btl of Shampoo in his hand with the psycho music in the Background.  I think the Russian one showed a Russian player faking injury so he wouldnt play Canada  Molson Canadian caught a lot of flak for apparently distasteful commercials belittling other countries.
291596,brw,2009-01-13 02:20:00,101,"As an American, I think they're hilarious. It's perfectly Canadian--to the point, with some good old fashioned humor thrown in for good measure. This past summer I bought a 12 pack and noticed a free T-shirt giveaway on the box, so I bought another 12 (so I could get 2) and went online to fill out the info. I got one that said on the back: ""Answer honestly: would you prefer to come from a country known for apologizing or famous for being rude?"" I laughed like h*** when I read it.  I wear it to the gym occasionally and sometimes get this wierd, ""hey I think they're dissing us"" stare when people read it. But most laugh and say: ""yeah, pretty much on the money........"" Wish I knew how to get another one.....this one is gettin kinda ripe and may not make it North this year. Long live Canada, Molson, shore lunches, Timmies, poutine, and ketchup potato chips..."
291598,Stoty,2009-01-13 02:35:00,2910,That last one KILLS me! hahahahahah
