291111,MJL,2009-01-12 03:14:00,2427,Great pics Cliff.  Love the vintage pics.
291134,Ramble,2009-01-12 03:46:00,713,"i love the old pictures. My grandmother has all of my grandfathers old pictures, and there is some amazing stuff in their. He was quite the ubush whacker before he enlisted for WW2.  Here is a picture of him on the Obabika river near Temagami back in 1942 i believe.    -R-"
291442,jonnybass,2009-01-12 21:23:00,346, Nice pic. I see that fishing is in your genes too.
291479,Moosebunk,2009-01-12 22:27:00,3970,"Hey man... in 76 you were just a little runt.  You can't be much older than me.  And here I though the wee Hobbit was in his 4rth century.  Great old pics.  Short shorts are out these days, but the walleye still look the same."
291650,snag,2009-01-13 04:31:00,1932,"Those were awesome Cliff.  Looks like your Dad liked to get outdoors with you guys.  I always treasured the times spent outdoors with my dad and look forward to carrying on the tradition.  Thanks buddy,  G."
291687,solopaddler,2009-01-13 10:54:00,8605,"Great to see the old pic's bud, and hey put a little facial fuzz on your dad and it's you LOL! (Can definitely tell he was your dad  )"
291935,ccmtcanada,2009-01-13 22:44:00,7971, Jim just got back to me...those first pics were Lake Couchiching....July 1961.
291942,solopaddler,2009-01-13 22:55:00,8605, Cooch? Really? The mystery of why the walleye crashed has been solved!
291948,ccmtcanada,2009-01-13 23:03:00,7971, Boy...you really are a smarta$$ today....LOL
290575,ccmtcanada,2009-01-11 02:32:00,7971,"I have been meaning to head to my mom's place to find the old photo albums to scan some older fishing pictures of my dad and his buddies.  After seeing Bernie's post, I decided to get off my butt and finally do it!  So, today I went over for a visit and came back with two huge boxes of photographs!!  Here's a few that I managed to scan today...  This is my dad...on a fishing trip with buddies...July 1961.   Another one of my dad...same fishing trip...   This was his best buddy at the time...Jim....   Group shot....   Not sure who this is...but it looks like he's trout fishing a small creek. v  This is Mr. Cooper.  I never knew his first name, but he was my dad's boss back in the 70s.  He had a cottage in the Belleville area that we spent a lot of time at...my first memories of fishing are here...with a stick, some fishing line and worms.  I caught sunfish after sunfish here....   Here's a few of us kids at that cottage...  Older brother and cousin...   Me and my younger brother...I'm on the right...about 1976.   Mr. Cooper's boat...my dad and us three kids...   Even though I hadn't fished in 10 or so years, my dad, who was battling cancer in this picture, invited me to go on a fishing charter.  This fish is the last fish he ever caught...he passed away 6 months later.   Would have loved to have had the chance to fish more with my dad, as I didn't really get into it until after he died in 1994, but the memories were cemented by him when I was a kid."

290612,jonnybass,2009-01-11 03:59:00,346,"   Nice pics. Fishing with a stick and string, you were hard-core even back then."

290706,WeedLine,2009-01-11 14:51:00,322,Your dad was stylin' with the Blueblocker glasses and that leather jacket. Cool fishing attire. Sorry he is not around so that you can take him fishing now.
290712,limeyangler,2009-01-11 15:02:00,5204,"WOW...and i thought shorts in the '80's were short!   Great pics Cliff, i especially like the one with the waders in the river...i have a very similar one of my dad.

290719,jediangler,2009-01-11 15:21:00,1923,Very nice Cliff. Thanks for sharing those with us. Now I'll have to get at my scanning new years resolution.
290911,Radnine,2009-01-11 22:35:00,1538,"I love that stuff. Do I detect a Mitchell 300 (first picture, reel on the left)? I still have one. Jim"

290970,Beans,2009-01-11 23:50:00,3339,Sure wish I had a camera way back when...unfortunately the only pics I have are in my mind's eye...(tough to scan)
290972,kickingfrog,2009-01-11 23:51:00,8333,Great photos Cliff! Any ideas on where the first ones were taken?
290976,kickingfrog,2009-01-11 23:54:00,8333," But you never run out of film, they are always in focus, the exposrure is perfect and the fish are all personal bests."
291006,ccmtcanada,2009-01-12 00:30:00,7971," I have no idea...but I can ask Jim (one of the guys in the pics).  11 years after my dad passed away, Jim married my mom...so he's my step dad now"
