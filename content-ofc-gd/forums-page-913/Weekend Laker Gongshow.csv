290996,steverowbotham,2009-01-12 00:17:00,1800,"I had Friday off work and figured I giver a go on Lady Simcoe, my old stompin grounds.  I got to my spot by 7:30 on Friday morning, walked to 98 FOW, dropped my vex and saw this ..... The pic is blurry, but either way, its a big school of herring.    I drop my spoon down and before it hit bottom it stopped, I set the hook and I iced a little laker, around 2 pounds, back she went.  Drop down again and jigged just below the herring... about 10 mins later, wham, fish on! A nice 5 pound laker... she ate it on the flutter and was bleeding heavily so I lunched her.    About 20 mins later my spoon got thumped and up came this lady, decent size.    I stopped taking pictures after this because the -20 was not nice on my hands.  I landed a couple more little lakers (1-2 pounds) and a few herring.  At around 11am the bite died.  I had a live minnow out all morning on 8lbs test that never got touched, so around 2pm I brought out the perch gear, 3lbs test and put a minnow back down the hole.  Not 30 seconds later, the rod buckled, after about 15 mins I got her to the hole, a beauty laker around 10-12 pounds, one head shake and snap, good bye, catch ya next time.  Around 3pm I was reeling up the umpteenth herring of the day when my rod reared back down then got light again, here was the result...   Would like to have seen the laker responsible for that.  I packed up around 4pm with my tally at 7 lakers, 1 whitie (only around 2 pounds) and countless herring.   SATURDAY  Not much of a report.  I went to a different spot today.  I was cold, left early and had to work early afternoon. I only landed 1 laker and 1 little whitie, and of course lots of herring... but the some guys around me just spanked them, lots of fish.  SUNDAY  A few people called me Saturday night to report their success, so I had to get back out.  Brought my g/f, Bojan (Bojangles) and Ryan (troutguy) and his buddy Dan.  It was a slow start to the day, not much happenin, then finally after some communication, we ended up fishin the same spot.  We all got our share of 1-3 pound lakers with a few diesels mixed in, and Kelli got her first lake trout ever, a beauty too.                  Hope you enjoyed.  be safe out there.  still only 4 inches where we were fishin"
