291818,irishfield,2009-01-13 19:10:00,26272," Now that was pretty easy wasn't it.. and I did it from the comfort of my home! lol  And Jonnybass... Stoty knows that I'm razin him... mind your own ...... business.  If you wanna live in a ""perfect retail world"".. go out and buy yourself a CTC franchise and run it how it should be run IYHO.  Guess I just have too close'a ties to CTC's going on's is all and these threads rub me the wrong way... like a loose jock cup!"
291845,jonnybass,2009-01-13 19:47:00,346,"So, your solution is for me to buy a CTC and run it myself? Do you wear a helmet?"
291847,irishfield,2009-01-13 19:50:00,26272, Not during sex... but you probably should !   NO... you can find some stellar employees to work for you.
291848,Stoty,2009-01-13 19:51:00,2910, OH GEESH....HAHAHAHA  I don't care who you are....that's funny.
291852,jonnybass,2009-01-13 19:59:00,346," That's a pretty lame comeback attempt.  OK, this ain't a fair fight so, I'll stop before I get banned. lol  "

291855,jonnybass,2009-01-13 20:05:00,346,"LOL, now he went back and changed his initial response after I already responded. How lame.  Just give it up man."
291856,irishfield,2009-01-13 20:05:00,26272,LOL Raf...  Jonny... you know what they say.. don't start a fight you can't finish. You seem to do a lot of that around here...  If Stoty had a problem with what I said... he would have told me... he has no problems that way ! lol Guess we go back further than your time around here.
291857,irishfield,2009-01-13 20:07:00,26272, I changed nothing... I added to it for clarity.. oh and check the times.
291858,Stoty,2009-01-13 20:07:00,2910,Dang....why can't it be two blonde's in mud and/or jello fighting about me?!?!?!?!?

291905,Photoz,2009-01-13 22:07:00,792,Weren't we discussing Crappy Tire somewhere in this thread?
291915,jonnybass,2009-01-13 22:20:00,346,"I was discussing Crappy Tire until I was told to mind my own darn business among other things.  Anyway, I stopped shopping at CTC long ago because of their customer service. The final straw: Instead of giving me an exchange, I was told to send my item to the manufacturer even though I had bought a defective product and brought it back within 30 days with my receipt.  That was a long time ago. Now I very rarely step foot in any of their stores. And I NEVER buy anything expensive because I know that I won't be taken care of should anything go wrong."
292067,TJQ,2009-01-14 02:45:00,7806,I think everyones spoke thier piece.....   lockulance!!!
291800,solopaddler,2009-01-13 18:08:00,8605,  HAHA! (We'll work something out  )
291330,Canuck2fan,2009-01-12 17:11:00,1444," I guess they didn't tell you the rain checks are good at any store.... You just have to check at your store after the sale. If they have stock they have to honour the raincheck. If they tell you they don't it just takes a quick cellphone call to CTC head office and they happily explain to the store staff about the franchise agreement and yadda yadda yadda LOL.  I love going in with a rain check from Kitchener to the Stratford store just to irritate them in Stratford because they never have items in stock after a sale starts on good items. Which means if you don't run in and pick it up on the night BEFORE the sale starts it will be sold out. I used to do that if I really wanted something and just get a price adjustment after... Recently I found out though that at both the Zellers and CTC in Stratford that the ""staff"" who do the pricing changes don't seem to work past 6PM at either store so the price is almost always changed by then the night before. So no trip back for an adjustment or rain check. I am hopeful when Walmart comes that the stores here will grow a brain and get it together so they actually have stock but I won't hold my breath.  St.Marys CTC is the best one in the chain for my money. One time I picked up a rain check for a friend who couldn't find something in Kitchener or Cambridge where they wouldn't give him a rain check just because the ad said there were no rainchecks. St.Marys said no problem I could get a raincheck which I did... I then promptly forgot all about it. 6 MONTHS later they called and told me the my items were in... I called my buddy who had wanted them for Thanksgiving but since Easter was in two weeks he said to go get them if I could. The next day I was delivering right beside the CTC so I go to pick them up and they didn't have the item on the raincheck... they had a similar model that was more than double the price instead.  The owner came out apologized for taking so long, he said when he was going through the rainchecks that were outstanding, he authorized the staff to upgrade a number of items like that. He said he wished sometimes the staff would clue in and do that the week after the sale instead of waiting for months to ask him if it is OK.  Since it is a small town they pretty much know every customer by name and he said that keeping a customer happy like me who he knows spends a TON of money there is a worth losing a few points of margin every now and then... I guess all the times I made a point of telling him I am from Stratford but drive to St. Marys to buy there because it is faster than waiting for 40 minutes while the teenaged staff in Stratford hide in the back room before coming out and saying I know the computer says we have it but I can't find it can you come back tomorrow and check again when Bill is here..."
291335,icefisherman,2009-01-12 17:27:00,952,"Joe, your post reminded me I wanted to grab one of those....called and my local store had ONE...just went and picked it up few minutes ago. Best thing to do is try to find which store close to you have one and go and grab it instead of waiting for stock on a rain check....it may never happen. Just make few phone calls...they are usually pretty good holding it for you until you go and buy it. It seems to be pretty gopod sled ....I've been using double kids sled but this one is taller and shorter so it'll fit in my car easier and even has spot for my auger. Will try it on the next whities/lakers trip ;-)  Cheers, Ice Fisherman"
291336,bigugli,2009-01-12 17:30:00,6138,"For all those who've been around the block for some time, remember Towers?  They had the same shoddy track record for not carrying adequate inventories of advertised items. The government received so many complaints about the practice, and enough pressure, that the law hit them with huge fines for the misrepresentations and bad ad practices. It amounted to a lot of negative PR and millions in fines. Shortly after conviction they folded.  Put simply, if you don't like the practice, start hollering at the government, the BBB, and every other consumer watch dog. Stop shopping there, and let them know it.  Get the local paper interested in the story."
291339,Headhunter,2009-01-12 17:38:00,5703,"Glad you were able to grab one Emil! I did just what you suggested... I had the clerk look at all the stores within  my area and they showed none in stock. I wasn't about to ask him to check within 60 miles of my location as that would have meant spending the $20.00 I was saving on the sled, on gas! HH"
291342,LeXXington,2009-01-12 17:44:00,1928,I went into CTC for other things but thought I would just check..   They never sold them to being with.  You will find that as each store is individualy owned sometime they just don't bother as at the end of the season they have to hold onto these things that don't sell.  I agree why put it into a flyer and not have stock!! hummm false advertisement just too get you into the store
291345,Moosebunk,2009-01-12 17:54:00,3970,"HH  Consider yourself lucky you ""have"" a store to go to for fishing stuff. lol.  Nahhh, I hear ya.  CTC's are usually great spots but at times they can simply sell out."
291353,Photoz,2009-01-12 18:14:00,792,"I had a bad experience getting chased around last spring trying to get a metal detector CTC stores were advertising. They sold me a model number that had been discontinued after being sent to THREE different stores that showed them having the item they listed. I finally mailed a letter to CTC head office, customer relations, and copied it to the managers of the 3 stores that had it listed as being in stock. Within a few days I recieved a call from  a customer service manager, who offered to courier me the right detector, at the advertised price at their cost. She also said I'd be receiving a letter of apology, which I did! Plus . . .    a $50.00 cheque for my trouble! I posted this in May of last year, with a photo of the letter & cheque. Jumping up and down & foaming at the mouth here will get you NO PLACE. First . .   go to the store nearest you with the ad, ask for the product . . . .     if they do not have it, and either can't prove they've ever had it, or admit this, ask for the manager. THIS is where you start documenting things . . .  date . . .   time . . .   who you spoke to, and the gist of the conversation. If you get dicked around, leave, call a few more stores in the area AFTER checking their sites to see if your item is listed as in stock. If it turns out they don't have it either, ask for the customer service rep. Again, DOCUMENT everything, including the name of the rep, also explain you would like the name of the store manager, because you will putting your complaint on paper. Then, call head office, ask for the name of the customer service manager and their mailing address. Then write a letter explaining you've been a loyal customer for XX amount of years, but lately the service has been getting very poor, then explain your plight and ask if this is a good way to treat a log-time customer? And what you think is fair? AT NO TIME DO YOU BECOME IMPOLITE, DEMANDING OR THREATENING . . .    this will getcha NOWHERE. The names you are writing to MUST be spelled properly, the spelling in the rest of the letter should NOT have mistakes or inconsistencies either. When you're finished your letter, check it twice, then check it again . . .    there's nothing that has more power than a well written, factually correct letter of complaint! A poorly written letter, rife with inconsistencies, factual errors, spelling or gramatical errors will likely get filed under 'G!' Do this the way I've suggested, follow it to a 'T' and I guarantee you'll get results!  P. S.  It's not a bad idea to read the fine print at the bottom of the flier . . .    occasionally store specific . . .     you nearly need a lawyer to go over some of 'em! I'm not sure which arm of the government (Consumer & Commercial Relations?) would look after this if you STILL aren't satisfied, THAT is the big stick you save as a last resort!"
