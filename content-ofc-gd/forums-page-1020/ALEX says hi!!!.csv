His computer is toast and he's very busy with his new daughter!  He misses the board and hopes to be online in a little while.  He wishes everyone a great summer...with great fishing!  Here's what's keeping him busy.... 
210591,Greencoachdog,2008-06-04 03:36:00,8163,I was wondering where he had run off to... out propagating the species eh!

Say hello and what a cute child (cant believe i wrote that ,but its true) must have come from the wifes side of the gene pool. Hard to believe but there are other things more important than  fishing, but ALEX has found one it looks like, but I bet she looks even cuter with a fishing rod in her hands  ."
