Surface temps were 58-60 weeds were coming in all fish were taken in 14-16 ft of water just outside weed edges, guess i should play a day or two of hooky off work this week as well seen some mayflys on the windows the past two nights."

209801,Sinker,2008-06-02 20:04:00,8692,Thanks for the report!  I think this is going to be the week for eyes on the kawartha's. They're starting to settle into their summer locations.  I'll be out once or twice for an evening this week for sure.  Sinker

We got our tourny limit both days and I nailed a 27"" skinny spawned out female that took 'Big Fish' Award for the overall 2 days.  We finished up 2nd place overall.  We got lots of fish working the deep w/l points and also took some on some rock shelves in 30'.  Here is a pic of the Walleye..... Greg. "
