210356,MuddyWater,2008-06-03 17:46:00,218,im buying a boat off my buddys neighbor and i was just wondering about trailer plates and numbers on boats and stuff about ownership? or can i just slap her in the water? anything would be cool because ive never owned a boat before!
210365,bushart,2008-06-03 18:07:00,2628,Safety gear---bailing bucket--2 oars/paddles--heaving line--pealess whistle (mine on lifejacket) floating flashlight---running lites if out in the dark  Used to be no licence on boat if under 10hp
210374,Reef Runner,2008-06-03 18:24:00,981,"To add to busharts comments on safety gear:  An anchor, floating rope and lifejackets to accomodate occupants.   I would also say having two short (5foot) ropes with clips on hand for easy tie up to the dock.  Clips on each end of the ropes are a good idea so you can easily change what side of the dock you want to park it at, depending on the winds, depth and so forth.  Otherwise I would add... GPS/sonar stereo with waterproof speakers rod holders downriggers swivel seats bikini models"
210379,Victor,2008-06-03 18:44:00,1609,"i guess bushart and reefrunner already covered all the stuff you need in the boat.  As for trailer plate go, you'll need to go to an ontario drivers licensing centre and register for one. You'll need a Bill of sale (ask the seller to write one up), proof of ownership and you'll have to pay tax for the price of the trailer (you can ask the seller to just write $50-100 on the bill of sale). Do up a search on OFC, there's some info on here... i'm going through the same process as well, have to get mine licensed this week.  Is your boat motor bigger than a 10hp? If so, it will need to be licensed. Go to Transport Canada to do that."
210380,Victor,2008-06-03 18:45:00,1609,"o to add to the trailer plate registration, there's a $35 fee."
210410,bushart,2008-06-03 19:57:00,2628,Man I should have said Bikini models---I guess it should be a given
210417,Reef Runner,2008-06-03 20:25:00,981,  LOL
210485,HTHM,2008-06-03 23:07:00,4082,Here is a place that can sell you all kinds of different models of bikinis http://www.bikinivillage.com/en/default.idigit
210751,JFR,2008-06-04 14:36:00,498," 1.  What is the HP of the motor,  under 10hp no registration required.  Over 10hp, must be regisetered through Service Canada        http://www.servicecanada.gc.ca/en/sc/boats...surecraft.shtml  2.  If the boat already has registration numbers, then the owner must give you the original form signed by him.  You then take this to the Service Canada office in your community and change the registration.  Service Canada does not collect the GST  3.  Check this link to know what safety equipment is mandatory  http://www.tc.gc.ca/marinesafety/tp/tp511/menu.htm  enjoy your new toy  Just JOHN"
210820,Meely,2008-06-04 16:56:00,282,Question:  I am in the midst of selling a boat as well. On the back of the original Licensing (Registration) Form ( from the dealership ).....it mentions the Vendor must notify the customs house of the change in ownership.  Does this still hold true or have things changed since I bought the bought 8 years ago?  Meely
