Secondly does anyone have any experience with these crafts?  I think it would be really handy to take out in small lakes/rivers since I don't have my own boat yet."
210327,jdmls,2008-06-03 17:04:00,575,talk to Urban Fisherman...he has one that is quite rigged out...
210419,super dave,2008-06-03 20:29:00,323,Which Costco location did you see it at?  I would like to take a look.  Thanks.
210421,nancur373,2008-06-03 20:36:00,1211,Saw a guy using one on a fishing show few days ago. It looked like he had total control and very easy to manuvre.
210476,forrest,2008-06-03 22:54:00,1032,It weighs quite a bit (77lbs) so it may limit your access to certain areas but looks like it has everything. I know the Hobie float cats strap to your back....don't know if this one does the same.  Better than standing on shore.   forrest

210761,Zubris21,2008-06-04 14:55:00,563," It was at the Kingston store,  wasn't advertised on their website so it might be this location only, I don't know.   It does seem kinda heavy (77lbs) but it does at least disassemble, and has a drop down wheel, so it can be assembled car side then wheeled into the water."
210873,huntervasili,2008-06-04 18:22:00,1604,Generally Pontoons of that size are that heavy... It all depends on what you want... if you want really light you go with a tube... Check out the comments on the cabelas site... they are usually pretty accurate.
