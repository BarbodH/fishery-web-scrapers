210403,bucktail,2008-06-03 19:44:00,1857,Might be going up to Wolseley Bay next week if everything works out. I was wondering if any one could throw me a couple patterns for eye's. I have never been there so i am not quite sure where to start.  Thanks  Darren

If you aren't familiar, and especially with the weather we've been having this year, I would suggest looking into getting a guide for half a day.  They know the habits of eye's in there better than anyone.  There's alot of water up there and I remember someone saying that a major factor in their location is determined by the season, water temps and fronts passing through.  We did not have a GPS so no coordinates to PM ya on one spot that held eyes for us.  Motor up the French from the Bay and just maybe a couple kms (estimate..around Dokis) before it opens into Nippissing is a single buoy in the middle of the river.  A nice hole there to drop jig and minnow.  Not too many buoy that way so it should be easy to spot.  Sorry if there are alot of    but as I said we did not have the appropraite gear to mark spots.  Just site and memory.  Hope it helps  reefrunner"
