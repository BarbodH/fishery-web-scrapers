Always willing to give a tip or have a chat with a casual angler or someone looking to take fishing more seriously.  Some excellent prizes up for grabs here but the most important thing is helping out a friend.  here is the link   http://www.ofncommunity.com/forums/index.php?showtopic=19874  anyone looking to donate can PM Matt for tickets, I will have a block next week as well.  Any corporate donations are appreciated as well. I am working on a separate draw for anyone who is an OFC member that buys tickets.  Thanks to everyone who has already supported this great cause  Jamie   "

210373,bpsbassman,2008-06-03 18:20:00,941,"Went to one of his seminars at the Sportsman Show a few years ago.  It was in the afternoon on a weekday.  My buddy and I ended up being the only ones in attendance.  Spent the hour just listening to stories that he normally wouldn't tell during a seminar.  My gut ached from laughing so hard. Have met hime several times since at BPS.  Just a genuine good person. Jamie, you have a PM  "
