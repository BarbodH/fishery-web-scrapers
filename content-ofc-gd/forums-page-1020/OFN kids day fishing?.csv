210430,splashhopper,2008-06-03 20:54:00,2931, Great pics... I am open to helping with some kind of prizes for all the kids too.  splashhopper
210432,splashhopper,2008-06-03 20:56:00,2931," Goby?  they want the kids to catch the GOBY!  I was thinking of an OFC tournament to put ""some faces to the names"".  Splashhopper"
210436,ccmtcanada,2008-06-03 21:07:00,7971," I have refrained from replying because I had to check our summer schedule.  I think it's a great idea....problem is finding free time.....  As it's turning out, I'm booked until August....and 2 of the 4 weekends in August are already booked.  One that is not booked is the long weekend, but I'm sure lots of other people already have plans for then.  We already have our little one in a kids tourney....albeit not an OFC tourney for the first weekend in July.  I'd say go ahead and plan, and if some of our plans get canceled we can show up....I'd hate to committ now and then not show."

210464,Handlebarz,2008-06-03 22:28:00,3790,The best game I have ever saw for kiddies and keeps your work down also.    For the Belle River Chapter of Muskies Canada we do a fishing clinic and help out with two different fishing derbys (one for many years and just added another this year) they are held at the Belle River boat launch and marina there is a splash pad there for the kiddies to get wet a beach and tipical park area. The best thing is there are alot of HUGE trees that shelter you from the sun as in the past years we have had some hot days last year it was over 90 in the am and looking to be a bad day but with the shade and water it saved everyone.   Like Brian said keep it about the kiddies and think of them when doing stuff just because you are not having fun or it does not interest you DO IT ANY WAY and then look into there eyes you will receive the best gift from the gleam they will have. One thing fish a bit then chase frogs or play a bit then back to fishing let them dictate what you are doing that day as its there day. The will remember it for the rest of there lives. Bring lots of drinks for everyone as many will for get this stuff.
210516,Gerritt,2008-06-04 00:11:00,6129,"I too would be interested in this, My almost three year old loves to fish! be it from the dock or the boat,  I would be willing to help organize such an event,  A quick suggestion?? it would be nice to find a place that might also allow camping? then we can make it an adventure! fish during the day, have a ""family meal""  group activities etc... Bring our wives so they can mingle and meet one another etc..  Or we could just organize a quick tourney for the kidlets... I think Binbrook Conservation area would be ideal for something like this.. large pavillions, Easy shore fishing access all over the lake, boats are allowed (no Gas motors) and a playground..  If some are into the camping Idea as well.... say for a night or two..?  just throwing thoughts out there..  G"
210522,danbouck,2008-06-04 00:17:00,4380,Camping would be great! Maybe we should pick a few places and have a poll to see what place is best
210559,splashhopper,2008-06-04 02:09:00,2931, This place looks interesting to me. How about the others?  splashhopper and botbot
209614,splashhopper,2008-06-02 11:44:00,2931,"Is there an OFC kids fishing day this summer?  If so, when?  If not, who else would be interested?  splashhopper and daughter (Botbot= pretty little girl in Filipino>> pronounced like the word good good   )"
209786,misfish,2008-06-02 19:14:00,29133,"I dont understand WHY,there would be no interest in this. Theres an ADULT week away .LOL Im sure theres got to be some interest out there? Take yer kids fishing."
209791,Puckhead,2008-06-02 19:28:00,377,I would be more than happy to attend - my three year old daughter has been bugging me to go fishing all spring...  I've just been trying to find sure fire spots to take her pan fishing that isn't too far from the Oakville/Burlington area!
209796,splashhopper,2008-06-02 19:51:00,2931,Maybe some of the parents that have posted pics of them with their children could help us start up an annual OFC kids day some where?  We would be willing to help start this from the London to Toronto area. ( and can also attend in the Markham-Oshawa area as well)  Splashhopper and Botbot
209829,GBW,2008-06-02 21:19:00,8460,"What about a crappie or perch event out on Scugog? I just don't have a way to get my 14' tin can there... if the date and time is good, I'll be in with my little girl.  just need to get the boat there..."
209851,misfish,2008-06-02 21:52:00,29133, YOU DONT NEED A BOAT TO TAKE A KID FISHING.
209857,danbouck,2008-06-02 22:08:00,4380,I'm in! let me know when and where (as long as it's not too far).  I am willing to help out to organize this also.
209859,misfish,2008-06-02 22:16:00,29133,"OK IF I MAY. IF YOU WANT TO HAVE A GREAT DAY FISHING WITH THE KIDS ,YOU GOT TO HAVE  A PLACE THAT HAS LOTS OF PAN FISH FROM THE SHORE,AND HAVE AN ALTERNATIVE TO THOSE LITTLE WEE ONES THAT GET BORED OR NOT WANTING TO FISH ALL DAY,YOU GOT TO HAVE A PARK WITH SWINGS AND A SLIDE AND ALL THAT FUN KID STUFF. IT,S ABOUT THE KIDS HAVING A GREAT DAY AND NOT ABOUT US. KEEP IT SIMPLE.HOTDOGS ,BURGERS,ON THE BBQ. YES,HAVE A BBQ FOR THEM.MAYBE EVEN SOME LOW COST PRIZES JUST FOR PARTICAPATING."
209862,danbouck,2008-06-02 22:28:00,4380,"There are many Conservation Areas that would be great spots for this. They have the playgrounds, beaches and lakes.  I think it's a matter of finding a central location for everybody that is coming."
209866,misfish,2008-06-02 22:35:00,29133,"My last post, must be the grandfaddur coming out of me.LOL Sorry fer shouting.  Try this place http://www.creditvalleycons.com/recandleisure/islandlake.htm"
209892,GBW,2008-06-02 23:47:00,8460,"You don't know my 4 year old.  She chirps when we are in the big boat (17'6"" with a 115 on it) and I'm not going full speed..."
209899,misfish,2008-06-03 00:06:00,29133,My last word on this.YER MISSING IT FELLA.
209901,danbouck,2008-06-03 00:12:00,4380,Fishing and Boating are two different things!
209919,TJQ,2008-06-03 00:33:00,7806,"For the kids... its quantity of fish not quality,,,  rock bass off off docks was always our kids favorites when they were little..."
209922,GBW,2008-06-03 00:35:00,8460,"I'm not missing a thing. That I know so if there is a kids day, I want to have access to our boat as well.  I know I do not NEED a boat to take her fishing as we fish off the dock at the cottage 2, 3 or 4 times a day when we are there.  That all depends on the weather and her mood. Geez, string a guy up for saying he want's to partake in a kids fishing day and bring a boat a long...  WOW..."
209996,splashhopper,2008-06-03 02:19:00,2931,"ok,, how about we think of Port Dover for some Perch fishing?  Maybe we can all put our own locations up and then get an idea of what makes sense to us all.  I like the idea of ""stuff to do"" other than fishing for the little ones too.  We are in London and are willing to travel up to 2 hours.  Thanks  Splashhopper and Botbot"
210093,jediangler,2008-06-03 05:07:00,1923,"I have a 7yr old, and agree that a conservation area with decent shore fishing, a playground and beach area would be a slam dunk. I like Island lake, but Valen's is a kid's paradise.  http://www.conservationhamilton.ca/parks/visit/valens.asp"
210101,SlowPoke,2008-06-03 08:50:00,2984,"I would be very interested in attending a family/kids day. If I can throw out an idea... Turkey Point Provincial Park - http://www.ontarioparks.com/english/turk.html It is pretty central to London/Kitchener/Hamilton, has great facilities and a huge clean beach. For those bringing boats, they can launch nearby and anchor off the beach. A group picnic shelter is available for $50 and is located by the play area. -Brian"
210204,Carp,2008-06-03 13:49:00,1488,Sounds like a great idea.  Had my 2 oldest (6 & 8) out on L. Simcoe just over a week ago. Thought it was best to have them fish with a float rather than off bottom. That way they didn't have to hold the rod and concentrate so much. Kids love watching that float go under.  We hooked over 100 perch in the same spot. I only caught about 10 because most of my time was spent baiting hooks and casting lines. They had a blast.
210242,steve_paul,2008-06-03 15:03:00,658,"Splashhopper, there is a Kids Fun Rock Bass Derby in Long Point this weekend put on by Rotten Ronnie's.  I used to take the kids every year to it, Ron always puts on a good tourney for the kids and they each receive a little grab bag of fishing goodies at the end.  Lots of shore spots too around the area to fish from and the weather looks like it is going to be great.  Here is some info on it if you are interested:  Hey guys! Don't forget to bring the kids and grandkids out to this year's Rock Bass Derby. Juniors age 2 to 8 and Seniors age 9 to 13. Prizes for all. Contact Rotten Ronnie's 519-586-7990 or [emailÂ protected]  It is a 2 day derby. Last time for registration is 10 am Sunday morning with final weigh in at 3pm Sunday. If you fish both days you can weigh in one fish and upgrade the next day if you catch a larger one. Remember, this is for the kids so we are flexible. You can fish anywhere in Long Point Bay (except the sanctuary)Ages are 2-8 and 9-13. A good time is had by all. Draw prizes for all kids at weigh in on Sunday as well as grab bags for every entrant. Entry fee is $3.00 per child. "
210250,Puckhead,2008-06-03 15:15:00,377,Misfish - 100% bang on - exactly the type of thing I would have in mind...
210252,JEREMY,2008-06-03 15:25:00,300,Thats  a great idea.My son would be in if it was the right day and location.
210272,MoriaRiverMan,2008-06-03 15:57:00,314,Oldest would be in for sure depending on location Would also sponsor event for say food or something. Caught his first two fish lastnight trolling and reeled in himself  
210277,TJQ,2008-06-03 16:04:00,7806,What about this one???  http://www.ofncommunity.com/forums/index.php?showtopic=20220
210427,splashhopper,2008-06-03 20:50:00,2931,"  That would have been a good start for us, however, my daughter ( 10 yr old) is in a Taekwondo tournament in Toronto that weekend. (Patterns only, due to her broken bone in her hand yet). ..........  As for a location, we are open to both the Long Point and the Hamilton location. If we get some families from the Toronto region,( BIG HINT TO CLIFF AND BLY AND FAMILY   )location due to the driving times.  Splashhopper and Botbot"
