210087,bucktail,2008-06-03 04:23:00,1857,"Wings should have won this game 4 times by now, Pens will probably steal it, thats how it seems to go most of the time! Outstanding play by Fluery! Go wings!"
210089,Stoty,2008-06-03 04:47:00,2910,What a crappy ending......Pit definitely didnt deserve to win that game.
210092,Marty,2008-06-03 05:00:00,873,Want some cheese with that whine?   The wings were outplayed . . . again.   The score finally showed it!!!!!!!!!
210125,pigeonfisher,2008-06-03 11:24:00,696,"Was a good game, but it ran too late for me."
210127,MCTFisher9120,2008-06-03 11:27:00,3761,The older guys on Detroit got to tired. WTG Pittsburgh!
210128,danbouck,2008-06-03 11:31:00,4380, Great Game  BTW I made it to work
210146,Stoty,2008-06-03 12:06:00,2910," The Wings got outplayed????  The Wings outshot, out face-offed, outhit, outskated and out chanced the Pens. Not to mention killed off 2 penalties in OT on crap penalties.  I am not sure which game you were watching!!  Either way though, its not going to matter. They wont beat Det two straight."
210408,Sebastian,2008-06-03 19:56:00,208,LOL Detroit outplayed the Pens big time. The only thing that saved the Pens was Hudlers 4 min high sticking penalty. Great game none the less. Props to Zetterberg. He is one hell of a player.
210489,gone_fishin,2008-06-03 23:16:00,481,  the only thing that saved the pens was Fleury standing on his head!
210514,danbouck,2008-06-04 00:10:00,4380,"I agree that Detroit outplayed the pens but as my old coach (well everybody's coach) said ""There is no I in team""  Fleury was amazing but didn't do it all!"
210521,richyb,2008-06-04 00:15:00,774,"Man did malkin look bad ...  With him saying that he wants the big bucks, I say trade him and keep hossa ...  I fell asleep at the end of the 2nd OT.. . But i loved that fast paced game ..   GO PENS @!!!!!!!    Oh and one more thing ... Give Malone a bonus .. I bet his face is sore today !!!!"
210568,gone_fishin,2008-06-04 02:37:00,481,"Well, Malkin did get the assist on the winning goal... he did play aweful for most of the rest of the game though... and Malone is an unrestricted free agent at the end of this year actually, so is Hossa... could be interesting..."
210589,scuro,2008-06-04 03:31:00,386,Hope? The old wings can't flap anymore after triple overtime. The young guns will take over especially tomorrow. Wings will get blown out Wed.
210612,Sinker,2008-06-04 05:15:00,8692,I made it to 5 mins into the 3rd OT.....and BAM.....my flippen power went out!!! I had to run out to the car to listen to it on the radio.....LOL.  GO PENS!!!  Sinker
210636,Chris,2008-06-04 11:29:00,405,"Like the great one said ""it's not how, it's how many"". The score was 4-3 and that's what counts....not how many face-offs you won or how many shots you had. Pittsburg has shown, in game 3, that they are every bit as good a team and can play along side the Wings when they decide to actually show up and play. The difference so far is Detroit is the more hungry team and they are finishing plays. Malkin seems confused and frustrated, quite a difference from his earlier rounds. Maybe his assist on the game winner will break him out of his funk. I give credit to the guys like Kennedy who play hard every shift. It would be nice to see them rewarded with a key goal.  Being behind 3-2 in the Stanley Cup Final is not too shabby for a team who has been ""dominated"". If the teams keep playing as they have, Detroit should win. If the Pens show up the cup could go to either team."
210650,Stoty,2008-06-04 12:12:00,2910," You're darn skippy! I would take him or Datsyuk over Malkin on my team ANY day.  Should be a goooood game tonight though! Cant wait. It will be a true test of the hunger for both teams tonight, after playing so much Monday. Now, its down to mental strength more so than physical strength. Everyone is tired, so its who wants it more.  Did you know? 10 of the past 12 Stanley Cup OT games have been won by the Visiting team. The visiting teams have a 15-4 record in OT games in the Cup Final since 1990. Thats crazy! Here's hopin that the game goes to OT tonight! hahaha"
209940,danbouck,2008-06-03 00:55:00,4380,We will see what happens in the next 40 minutes. I just wish Sid would start playing like we all know he can.
209945,gone_fishin,2008-06-03 00:57:00,481,"i wish Malkin would pick it up a bit, he's been useless this series... did you see those 2 give-aways during the power play in the first period... oh well 2-0 Pens!  Go Pens Go!"
209946,MCTFisher9120,2008-06-03 00:59:00,3761,Yup Let's go Pittsburgh im watching also. GO PENS GO!!!!!
209947,danbouck,2008-06-03 00:59:00,4380," Ya I'm not sure what's going on in his head. Maybe they should bench him for 5 and see if he gets it back. The commentator said it perfect when he said ""look how confused and angry he looks"""
209949,gone_fishin,2008-06-03 01:05:00,481,he is not playing well at all... he was amazing in all of the previous rounds too... i don't get it...
209955,Gerritt,2008-06-03 01:09:00,6129,He cursed himself...  No playoff Beard...  and no doubt... his GF is in the stands.. waiting for the after game **** ***....  G
210002,danbouck,2008-06-03 02:23:00,4380,It's over!
210013,Stoty,2008-06-03 02:36:00,2910,woooooooooooooooo GO WINGS GO................3 mins left!!!!!!!!!!
210017,danbouck,2008-06-03 02:39:00,4380,  hahahahahahahahaha

210021,danbouck,2008-06-03 02:42:00,4380,I'll stick with my original statement. Pens in seven!
210022,Stoty,2008-06-03 02:43:00,2910,OT!!! Cant get much more exciting that this......  I can just see it now...  Zetterberg scores the OT goal to win it......also takes home the Conn Smythe.
210023,danbouck,2008-06-03 02:45:00,4380,"More like this... Crosby gets the puck, goes through 5 red wings and hits the top shelf. Pens then go on to win the cup."
210024,Sinker,2008-06-03 02:46:00,8692, I like that much better......  Go Pens!!  Sinker
210027,Stoty,2008-06-03 02:47:00,2910,"Then Dan's alarm clock goes off.......    But....if that happens, then they totally deserve to win!"
210028,danbouck,2008-06-03 02:47:00,4380, 
210029,Gerritt,2008-06-03 02:48:00,6129,ok that there was just funny!  G
210034,Stoty,2008-06-03 02:52:00,2910,
210036,danc,2008-06-03 02:52:00,4677,Watch out for that Staal kid. The Staal's are the pride of Tundra Bay. I used to play against the old man.
210041,Gerritt,2008-06-03 02:54:00,6129,Were you at his retirement party too?  LOL!
210042,danbouck,2008-06-03 02:54:00,4380, Bet ya he's got a decent house these days!
210043,Stoty,2008-06-03 02:54:00,2910,I would like to see Flippula score it actually...he has played a KILLER game!
210044,Stoty,2008-06-03 02:54:00,2910,HERE WE GO....!
210046,danbouck,2008-06-03 02:56:00,4380,Pens win in 28 seconds!
210056,Stoty,2008-06-03 03:07:00,2910,Man oh man...Fleury is standing on his head!!!
