210257,TJQ,2008-06-03 15:33:00,7806,"After seeing the number of bears out there by our camp this year, plus the fact that the kids are older and exploring around camp more...  its occured to me that I should probably send them out with bear spray when they are walking around...  funny thing is I dont remember seeing it anywhere for sale....  Does anyone know where to get it in Ontario?????"
210259,cranks bait,2008-06-03 15:38:00,721,"Try a specialty camping store, army surplus, MEC.  Should be able to get it from any of them."
210261,Roy,2008-06-03 15:39:00,13728,"TJ, call your CO bud....he'll help you out with that."
210264,Headhunter,2008-06-03 15:42:00,5703,"I'd recommend equipping the kids with bear bells... they will certainly help keep them away, but pepper spray will help as well. HH"
210266,Roy,2008-06-03 15:44:00,13728,NOOO The bells and pepper joke would be inappropriate at this time.
210267,cranks bait,2008-06-03 15:55:00,721, You mean dinner bells and seasoning Roy?  I lived in Jasper Alberta and they were a hot item out there
210270,TJQ,2008-06-03 15:56:00,7806, Thats never inappropriate.....  except when it happens to you..
210271,troutologist,2008-06-03 15:56:00,951,"Just a suggestion if you do go that route of getting the spray, buy an extra can or 2, expensive yes but a instructional session in a gravel pit or somewhere could very well make a big difference. Knowing how spray reacts will greatly assist in effective safe use.  Be sure to instill observing the wind direction before spraying...."
210274,TJQ,2008-06-03 15:58:00,7806, Ya know... thats very good advice....
210281,Headhunter,2008-06-03 16:07:00,5703,"Cranksbait is correct... my wife's cousin lived in Jasper for 30 years and never left the house for a trip in the woods without her bells! She is an avid climber and most times, spent her time alone on the mountain. The most dangerous thing one can do with bears is catch them by surprise, it will put them in defense mode very quickly. Carrying bells with you lets the bear hear you well before you encounter it face to face and they will tend to run away before you even knew they were there. HH"

210288,Greencoachdog,2008-06-03 16:19:00,8163,"You may want to consider investing in a couple of these TJ:  Not only will the sound skeer the she-yit outta the bear, but will also alert you that they're in trouble.  I keep one in my boat at all times incase of an emergency.  You can buy them online here: http://www.safetycentral.com/orsasiairho8.html  The bear spray can also be purchased online. Just google bear spray Canada."
210297,TroutnMuskieHunter,2008-06-03 16:31:00,1362,TJ....Le Baron sells Bear Attack Deterrent canisters which are made up of Nitrogen and Dymel 134a...it's a liquid/gas combination that is supposed to be very effective.  Here's a link to a site that you can order from on-line....  http://www.macecanada.com/canada/animal.htm  Steve

210448,aplumma,2008-06-03 21:33:00,6896,I have never set off a can of bear repel  so this might not be the same thing. how would a small fire extingisher compare as far as to show the kids how to use it? It might be cheaper and safer than actually setting off the pepper spray.  Art
210452,danbouck,2008-06-03 21:48:00,4380,I bought a can of it off ebay last year for very cheap.
210518,Dozer,2008-06-04 00:13:00,896,"Wind direction, as mentioned, is very important.  First time I blew off pressurized spray I was pointing it up wind and man was I in for a surprise!"
210557,Greencoachdog,2008-06-04 02:03:00,8163,"   Didja learn a ""life lesson""???  ... don't whizz or bear spray into the wind!  ... especially if you have your mouth open!!!"
210597,luv2drift,2008-06-04 03:47:00,147,"the question was ""where can I get bear spray"" ...................the answere I got a huge can at bass pro! there you go..........arm your kids with it after you teach them and feel better..................as I would too............good luck budd."
210622,jace,2008-06-04 10:21:00,472,"From what i've read, consensus is that the bells don't do much because they are too high pitched which means the sound doesn't carry nor will an animal associate a high sound with something large like a human or predator.   I have a lot of friends who have remote cabins in bad bear areas and none recommend  using bells.  They say you should talk to someone or yourself, step on a lot of sticks to break branches, and carry spray.  They all carry handguns themselves...of course this is in the US."
