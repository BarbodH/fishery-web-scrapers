209370,Rybren,2008-06-01 22:15:00,28,"After 4 years of living in a far-away land with no fishing, I managed to tie up with a couple of my buddies for a rather wet weekend of fun on the Ottawa River near Pembroke.  We fished the river pretty hard on Friday afternoon & evening and for most of Saturday (in between thunderstorms) and did okay, all things considered.  We had gone hunting for eyes and managed to pick up 15 - 20, all under the 40cm size limit.  Unfortunately, we never did manage to find any worth bragging about.  There were a lot of hammer handle pike to be had as well.  In addition, we hooked into a couple of 10+ and 14+ pounders.  There were also a few smaller (2-5lb) channel cats, a few OOS smallies, some pan fish, and a bunch of some kind of silvery fish that none of us could identify.  My first thought was that they might be whitefish, but I haven't seen one in 30+ years and they didn't  match my mental picture of what I remember them looking like.  I think that our guy with the camera took a picture of one and once he sends it to me, I'll post it to see if anyone can ID the beast.  Boy, I have to tell you that it sure felt good to be back on the water with a rod in hand, drag screaming and the lads yelling ""look at the size of that thing!""  Cheers"
209473,holdfast,2008-06-02 01:25:00,1813,Love fishing the Ottawa and Petawawa.  You never know what and how big you may catch.
209483,fishindevil,2008-06-02 01:39:00,6254,"Well that fish was probly a mooneye,they are very scrappy,and fight hard for being a small shad like fish,their scales come off by the millions and they smell real bad,. they are spawning at this time of year ,and they will be around for a few weeks and then dissapear. some of the locals say they are good to eat,but i have never tried one....cheers"
209559,Mike the Pike,2008-06-02 04:14:00,3421,yup lots of moonie on the Ottawa be sure to show us some pics next time sounds like agood time despite the poopy weather  
209872,Rybren,2008-06-02 22:55:00,28,"I have to agree, the Ottawa is a very interesting river to fish.  After doing some research on the net and looking at the photo, I think that you guys are right - they were mooneyes.  Here's a shot of one....    This pike came in at a tad over 14 lbs...    and this one at 10 1/2 ilbs...    As I mentioned in my original post.  It was a blast to get back on the water and start fishing again.  My poor wife, I'm afraid that she'll soon be a fishing widow once again.  Cheers"
209895,woodro,2008-06-02 23:58:00,168,"Nice fish, my cousin lives on the Base in Petawawa and he said he'd have a great fishing season so far this year too. That fish looks like a shiner to me. Not postive on it though"
209905,Rybren,2008-06-03 00:15:00,28,"The fish was about 12-14"" long.  Don't know that I've ever seen a shiner that big.  Could be, though."
210009,Mike the Pike,2008-06-03 02:32:00,3421,Mooneye for sure nice chuncky pike thanks for the pics
210030,Crazyhook,2008-06-03 02:49:00,1154,"you 14 pound pike looks like a musky, any other pics of it?"
210038,Sinker,2008-06-03 02:52:00,8692,  Thats what I was thinking too.....sure looks like a lunge to me.
210077,Markus,2008-06-03 04:00:00,25,That looks like a muskie.
210164,Rybren,2008-06-03 12:53:00,28,I've caught many muskies before and I'm sure this isn't one.  Here's another pic.  It's not very good.  
210177,Victor,2008-06-03 13:15:00,1609,Thanks for the report and nice fish! You can take your wife fishing!
