We fish for Pike, Walleye, lake t's, and pans. (although Ive never caught a lake trout) http://flickr.com/photos/youngvedder/1366616364/ other pics are on there from the camp.  fishing is pretty good, but the peace and quiet is even better. anyone fish this area?  cheers,  Yv"

209802,Rich Clemens,2008-06-02 20:13:00,3131,Glad to have you on board and don't hesitate to share some of your pleasure.  We like pics of all species no matter how big.  Heck - just look at my first report for the year ... nothing bigger than the palm of my hand.  Hope to fix that in just under 3 weeks.
