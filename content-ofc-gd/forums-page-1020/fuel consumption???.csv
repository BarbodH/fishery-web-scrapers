I have'nt been able to afford to fill it completely yet (60 gal tank), and I was wondering what it costs others with a similar setup (ballpark) to troll for a few hours. I use my 9.9 kicker whenever possible. Any examples or ideas would be great. I have no idea yet what this boat will cost to run."

Never been out more then 4hrs yet tho..till this opener weekend anyway.. Ive a problem tho,..the freaking gas gauge doesnt work and you cant see the sides of the tank only the top.(Builtin)  Ive checked everything electrical wise and cant find the problem..(Incl.Fuses)..my radio doesnt work either????? Everythng else works just fine....its a new to me boat...Ill have to take it in to find out for sure. Last time out I spent about 3 of the 4 hrs on the trolling motor so's it dont count...still the $50 went in. From past posts, Ive just heard that if your not full throttle all the time the consumption should be fine....or less. Is it a 4strk you have????? Wish I could have been of more help. bNb  EDIT: the first time I put gas in it It took probably about twenty minutes pumping very, very slowly until the fuel in reached the top of the funnel I was using to just make sure it was completely full."

210566,Guest robw,2008-06-04 02:34:00,0,"It;s a 2 stroke. I'm hoping it does'nt cost too much more then $40-$50 each time I go trolling, or my fishing trips will be cut short by my personal banker (wife)."
210569,Guest robw,2008-06-04 02:39:00,0,"I think I might just have to bite the bullet and fill it full. Go out fishing, then fill it again, to get an idea. Just trying to think of a way to explin the importance of speding $300 of gas on my boat, to my wife........stupid speed bumps. lol"
210570,Guest skeeter99,2008-06-04 02:46:00,0,it costs to much  but if you can afford the toy you can afford the fuel!!
210578,Guest robw,2008-06-04 02:58:00,0,"Thats what I figured.......all in all, its still cheaper then the wife. LOL....let me try that argument."
210595,Mike the Pike,2008-06-04 03:44:00,3421,Well I love having a 4 stroke .50HP Honda 4 stroke and 2hp Honda 4 stroke Kicker  I took my motor off my Lund SSV 18 footer it burned more gas on this boat because of the flat hull.  I now have a Lund 1660 Classic twice the weight and uses less gas.  The new IPS hull technology is amazing.  A recent trip to Quinte fishing 10 hours per day for three days  Total fuel cost $32 for 3 days.Can't complain about that.
