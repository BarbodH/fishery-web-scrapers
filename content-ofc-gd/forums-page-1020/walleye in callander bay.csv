Coming up this weekend for my annual trip and wanted to see what the mood of the fish and anglers is like?  Any help would be appreciated.  Thanks"
207267,Mike01,2008-05-27 22:47:00,378,"Fishing is still pretty slow up here.  We have a big cold front coming through right now(it was below zero last night).  Try Gautier's Bay, was there yesterday and had some luck.  Slow trolling memorial drive is also a good bet."
207270,Andy,2008-05-27 22:51:00,330,"I was all over South Bay last week Tuesday to Thursday and found it very slow. I tried various flats, especially if I marked fish, and was only able to pull up a couple small perch out of 25' to 30' of water. I did catch a few pickeral, but I wasn't able to come up with a consistent pattern in the unsettled weather. Andy"
207444,love2fishhave2work,2008-05-28 02:32:00,212,That is what I figured.  Have been looking forward to this weekend since last year's first weekend in June but looks like mother nature did not cooperate.  Hopefully they turn on while I am there.  Maybe I will get to avoid the armada.
207480,love2fishhave2work,2008-05-28 03:43:00,212,"Sorry, one last question.  What is the water temp like right now?"
207592,Mike01,2008-05-28 14:20:00,378,"Callander Bay was 55 on the surface on Monday, but I suspect it has droped a bit over the last couple of days.  However it should warm up by the weekend."
