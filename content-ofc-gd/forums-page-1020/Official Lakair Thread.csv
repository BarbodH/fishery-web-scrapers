208581,Greencoachdog,2008-05-30 13:09:00,8163, Quit spreading Musky propaganda Lew!  ... There aint no Musky in Nippissing!!!
208632,SlowPoke,2008-05-30 15:09:00,2984,"ASS, GAS or GRASS - NOBODY RIDES FOR FREE! As far as ""Shotgun"" goes... no problem, I want the back seat all to myself. zzzzzzzzzzzz"
208673,JohnF,2008-05-30 17:36:00,3494,"I told myself last year that it sounded like a good time, and had every intention of making it this year. Of course now I've made no plans for accommodation or a boat ride. If anyone has to cancel let me know. Perhaps I can fill in. I'm no Walleye/Pike fisherman. All I know is bass, but I have boxes of lures of all sizes and styles and a variety of rod/reel combos so I'm sure I'll have the right gear.  I'm housebroken with only minor vices. Other than my pedantic personality the occasional cigar or pipeful is perhaps my most offensive habit. I'm old enough to have learned not to try to match the young guns beer for beer. A few drinks (brews or otherwise) each night is enough for me and beer is definitely NOT a breakfast food any more.  My river fishing buddy Rob would be up for it too if there's enough room, or an extra cabin. I could probably talk him into providing some fishart as a prize. Here's an example that hangs over my computer desk here. He'd hate the lousy photography but I used the only camera that was handy.    So if anyone knows of an extra spot or two (room and/or boat) let me know. For the moment I have no commitments for that weekend and I have a very very flexible work schedule. I don't expect a free ride.  JF"
208723,huntervasili,2008-05-30 19:54:00,1604,"If anyone has room in their vehic and wants to share gas costs, or split on my car PM me... Also if anyone has an open seat on their boat, I am good for half the cost... I would be leaving Burlington early afternoon Friday and staying till sunday/monday"
208756,JohnF,2008-05-30 21:29:00,3494,"Okay, here's a stupid question or three. It hadn't occurred to me there might still be cabin rentals available, and boats. I might even consider camping in a pinch. Rob's fine with camping but he's a nature boy/artist and we know how peculiar they can be, especially when they've been wading the creeks for the last 50 years all alone. Does anyone happen to know if there are any accommodations, and are the rental boats okay? I'm fine with a tiller unit. I grew up piloting them around the river beside our house. Are there any modern licencing restrictions on the little bitty boats cuz I have no kind of boat licence?  The more I think about this trip the more I like the idea, and I know Rob would really be into it, even if he does have to go in a boat. I might even entice my bil to join us but I suspect he'll be long gone to his fishing camp on Manitoulin by then. If I thought my son would join me I'd invite him, but I'm pretty sure he's still young enough, and musician enough, to think that fishing with the ole man is very uncool, although he did get a permit and borrowed a bunch of my stuff for a holiday at Huntsville last year. Who knows?  JF"
208757,Tarzan's Jane,2008-05-30 21:36:00,1183,Hi John...I received confirmation from Lakair yesterday that all the cabins are rented...but they do still have space in the tenting area.  Not sure about the boats...but if you do go to their site and give them a call...I'm sure they would help you out.  Good Luck
208778,JohnF,2008-05-30 22:30:00,3494, Thanks for confirming that. I'm not surprised. I'll check the camping thang.  JF
208811,ChrisK,2008-05-30 23:59:00,2772," Hey Mike, I like riding in the back seat but hey if you want to switch around I'm good for that too !! Joe, Did someone say hooch, bring it on bud !!"
208812,ChrisK,2008-05-31 00:05:00,2772, Hey wait a minute....lets not forget to mention the guy(other mod)who caught the biggest pike in that derby and walked away with a really cool prize.....ME  Thats right folks there is a really great prize not only for the fisherperson who catches the most combined inches but also the biggest pike overall !!!!  Hope to see you all there !!!!!  Chris
208816,mistyriver1,2008-05-31 00:25:00,600,Hope everyone has a good time.  I had the pleasure of being Kevin and Leslie's first guest of 2008 a couple of weeks ago.  Class A people all the way.
208926,kickingfrog,2008-05-31 12:28:00,8333, I didn't know that they had a tent area!!! I should have a vehicle that I can put my canoe on by then too. I may be there after all. No more hiding behind my keyboard.

209051,Greencoachdog,2008-05-31 17:40:00,8163, You can have the prize... but I think all the credit should go to the netman on that Pike! *we net a netman icon*
209282,ChrisK,2008-06-01 14:47:00,2772," Got me there Glen,got to give credit where credit is do. I must admit though, it is tuff finding good help these days"

208524,Roy,2008-05-30 10:23:00,13728,I can't be there before very late Friday night. It's too bad cause last year's inaugural shore lunch looks like a winner. I'm really looking forward to being there again this year though. I haven't missed a single one since the very first. Those of you who are teeter-tottering over whether to go or not....just make it happen. You won't regret it.
