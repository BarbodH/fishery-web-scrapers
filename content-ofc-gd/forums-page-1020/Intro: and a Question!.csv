My names Aaron, im from London, I enjoy fishing the odd time and outdoors, especially offroading  Now that im past that, here is my question:  Has anyone heard or been to the area in northern ontario called "" east bull lake"" ?  I tried looking on the net but all i can find is a thunderbearlodge.com website and a small page about mining for some metals.  Does anyone personally know how the fishing and hunting is up there? My dad is looking to purchase some property, he has never been there but likes the location, we still have to travel tthere to check things out but would love some opinions on the area  thanks  -aaron"
