210755,johnnyb,2008-06-04 14:44:00,3413,"from what I've read...big lake, excellent fishing...maybe worth going with a guide for half a day or so.  If you have a fax number, PM it to me, and I will send a copy of a map I have for it. (sorry -- i don't have a scanner) It's from an old Hines-Herringer-Jensen book, but it could give you a few spots to boost your confidence with, if nothing else."

Basically you go there to fish walleye. Fish the dam, but beware of the sanctuary in that area. Jigs and worm harnesses work well. Get a map off the internet and any bays, points and tribs all hold fish. Also bring alot of bug repellant.  tight lines  spawn"
