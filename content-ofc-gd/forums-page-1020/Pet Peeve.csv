210326,Stoty,2008-06-03 17:03:00,2910,Almost as tacky as random pictures and youtube videos in almost every thread.

210334,danbo,2008-06-03 17:10:00,2646,I'm talkin' bout all the mouthpieces that interfere! If the shoe fits..shove it!
210338,GBW,2008-06-03 17:15:00,8460,"Hum, so rules don't apply?  ""If this area is used for your first post, it will be deleted"" so no, your little cinderella shoe doesn't fit..."

210348,Stoty,2008-06-03 17:29:00,2910,"PM from Danbo to me:  So, Danbo can send PM's to others, but has chosen not to be able to recieve them. Why am I not surprised?   I am beginning to think that Danbo is horrible at grammar/typing because he never says anything. Just pictures and links. Either that, or its a representation of his mental capacity.  Hows your bike running? Get a bell of the handlebars yet?"
210350,GBW,2008-06-03 17:33:00,8460,maybe this will help  
210358,TJQ,2008-06-03 17:53:00,7806,OK... thats enough.....  Maybe we should disable  comments in the classifieds???
