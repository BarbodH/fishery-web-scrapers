209842,kentooley,2008-06-02 21:36:00,208,"Hi All  Spent Sunday fishing for carp with a buddy and boy did they cooperate! We started at about 8am and the bite didn't slow down until about 5pm but  we were both carped out by then.  :lol: I landed 18 and lost 3, all good size, with my buddy not far behind. The weather wasn't the greatest  (cloudy and windy) but the fish didn't seem to mind. Cheap way to spend a fun day(2 cans of Mr. Goudas corn and a 10 min drive from home).  Here's a couple of pics.        "

210506,lazybum,2008-06-03 23:53:00,142, I was thinking the same thing as I looked at the pictures  . Ooooh that fragrance will last for a while and no doubt attract something - a racoon maybe possibly a female?.
