210144,lew,2008-06-03 11:57:00,12767,"I know when the kids say something is bad, they actually mean it's really good, and if it's bad azz, it's even better, but I'm not sure what they mean about something being sick.  I've got some really nice chrome wheels on my truck...at least I think so...and last evening I was stopped at a red light and 2 kids were standing at the bus stop, and the one kids says to me ""Heyyyyyyyyyy doooood, those wheels are really SIIIIIICK MAN""   I dunno if he was complimenting me or taking a shot at me   That's one of the problems with getting older, I never know what the heck the kids are talkin about anymore"
