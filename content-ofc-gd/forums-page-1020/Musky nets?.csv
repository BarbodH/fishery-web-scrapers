209997,buckster,2008-06-03 02:20:00,530,Looking to purchase a musky net.  Have had to many close calls trying to scoop them outta the water with my mits.  Anyone know of somewhere where i can get a good quality net?    Anyone recommend a certain net?
210001,Pigeontroller,2008-06-03 02:23:00,2793,"You have 3 main types/brands that are popular, all are in the $150-$200 range.  Beckman- Finsaver Magnum Pen Net  Frabil- Big Game or Big Kahuna  Stowmaster, not sure of name but the large one!  www.protacklemuskyshop.com, www.muskyshop.com or JB's Fishing Depot in Toronto"

210072,silveradosheriff,2008-06-03 03:50:00,1025,I am very happy with the Frabill Kwik Kradle.
210175,BillM,2008-06-03 13:10:00,17367,Old salmon fishing net is going to make due for us this weekend.  I've seen some homemade cradles out of burlap and some 2x2's..  Looks like a cheap and viable solution.
210187,Meely,2008-06-03 13:24:00,282,"I had a craddle sitting in my closet for about 2 years. I finally decided to give it a try last summer. I was trolling believers when I got me a nice ski. Out comes the craddle, craddle the fish in the water, one good thrash and I got me a craddle stuck with believer hooks. I had a heck of a time trying to pull each hook out. After that, I rolled her back up and put her back in the closet. I think she'll stay there. Frabil nets are the only way to go now.  Meely"
210190,mattyk,2008-06-03 13:29:00,2110,i have a frabill big game and really like it.
210200,muskymike,2008-06-03 13:42:00,772,"I also have the Frabill Big Game net and am really happy with it. Although I think I would have purchased a Fin Saver now that I have the Frabill. The bag is not as stiff. Either way they are both great products. I bought mine from Stacy at Pro Tackle, great guy to deal with and great service. JB's has them as well just like Dax said.  I would trust just about anything Dax says actually, so go with what he said."
210209,DANIMAL,2008-06-03 14:00:00,215,The Frabil big kahuna works great for me. I've never tried the big beckman but I've only heard good things about it.
210214,lew,2008-06-03 14:07:00,12767," I somewhat agree Mike.  I've  been using the Frabil Big Game for several years now and find the handle & hoop much stronger &  far superior to the Beckman, but even after a lot of use the bag is still extremely stiff, plus it tapers to a point basically.  I prefer the Beckman pen-style square bag in that it's much softer, yet still fish friendly, and I find it easier to work on the fish with it rather than the Frabil bag.  I'm thinking very seriously about ordering a Beckman bag & using it with my Frabil frame, giving me the best of both worlds."
210246,Pigeontroller,2008-06-03 15:09:00,2793,"Excellent idea Lew! I consider the Frabil yoke to be far better and user friendly, but I really like the Beckman Bag.  Anyone that can afford the rods/reels/tackle to chase Muskie should be able to afford the proper NET. An old Salmon net can do alot of damage to a big Muskie's fins!"
210265,mattyk,2008-06-03 15:43:00,2110,"Pigeontroller is right. I remember the first time i caught a musky and i didnt have the proper net and it did a lot of damage to the fish's fins, and felt pretty bad. After that incident i decided that i would purchase a proper musky net. Well worth the money if you ask me."
210287,TroutnMuskieHunter,2008-06-03 16:19:00,1362,I use the Frabil Big Kahuna and love it!!!
210474,buckster,2008-06-03 22:51:00,530,thanks for all the feedback!  I took a look at the Beckman.  Great net i might just do it!
