210107,cisco,2008-06-03 10:01:00,597,"Sorry to say, but the gas can you've got will be venting inside the new below-decks area. I'd install a fixed tank with a proper vent line to the outside of the enclosure, so gas fumes don't build up in there especially on hot days.  Many folks have been blown to smithereenies by not doing so.  What you've got there is a ticking time bomb waiting for a spark."
210240,Bly,2008-06-03 15:00:00,1556,"Looks awesome Tim!   Been thinking of making a few mods to our boat, thanks for taking the time to post the pictures and some of the tech info.   Assuming you are heading out for the opener this weekend..hook lots!"

210313,GBW,2008-06-03 16:51:00,8460,Very GOOD point!  Thanks for pointing that out so now I know better for when I work on mine in the off season...
210372,Doctrt,2008-06-03 18:19:00,141," If you look closely the compartments with the gas tanks , they are well vented already.  Infact I looked into spec standards and I was told my  venting was more than enough.  Standards require a 3/4 inch vent from what I recall.  My vents are 3-4 inches.  As far as the tippiness debate goes, all you weekend physicists could not be more wrong.  After having studied physics for nine years post grad I did pick up a few things.  The story of Beans falling into the water happened because he was sitting on a seat 8"" above the gunnels.  That puts his fixed centre of mass (somewhere about the belly) approximately 12-24 inches above the gunnels.  That could present an issue.  If you read my posts closely, you'll see that my floor (weighing less than 100 lbs) is situated at the same height that the seats were, minimally elevating the centre of mass.  To offset this, there is a great deal of ""weighty"" clutter stored in those compartments, including the gas tanks, tackle, anchors, not to mention the extra battery for a total of 2 at the back of the boat.  These combine to actually drop the centre of mass allowing for increased stability.  If there is any argument for increased tippiness, it has only to do with the trolling motor as it is mounted above the gunnels.  This doesn't concern me as it is only positionned as such while driving.  While I'm fishing, the heavy motor section is well below the centre of mass, infact, well below the waterline.  As you can see, every aspect of this project was very well thought out.  Thanks to all for you're concerns but I'm quite content with how it turned out.  T"
210385,GBW,2008-06-03 18:59:00,8460,Thanks for clearing up the gas tank venting comment! I still say it's a nice looking boat and I would love to check the boat out!

I am currently trying to rebuild my boat over but I procrastinated and now I would rather be fishing than fixing. It is a slow process.

205577,glen,2008-05-24 02:38:00,2641,Stan you might be able to use deck screws.  I have used them in my boat. Homedepot has marine vinyl but it aint cheap.  It cost me about 500 for the wood floor and vinyl.  500 more for seats and pedestals.

205581,fishinfool,2008-05-24 02:52:00,366,"I have purchased 3/4 smooth one side regular ply to start and have cut all the pieces that I require to put the floor and covers etc back on. I also purchased indoor/outdoor carpeting which I will glue onto the ply once I have Thompson water sealed all of it. I am now looking to buy or build a new console and new seats and pedestals, so if anyone has anything they might be interested in selling let me know Then I need to rewire the whole boat front to back and while I'm at it, I will be rewiring the trailer with new LED lights. Whewwwwww, I'm tired just typing what I have to do...  A friend gave me an older Minn Kota trolling motor which I will install on the bow which I will also install ply into. If you have any advice or tips, please feel free to throw them out there, I am learning as I go.   Sorry for hijacking your thread.  Glen, did you use marine ply?"

205666,Guest Johnny Bass,2008-05-24 14:09:00,0," What? You don't fish from a yacht or a $60,000 dollar ranger?  I agree with Clamp-it. I think all boats are tested for bouyancy(Sp?) in rough waters.  Weight re-distribution might effect how the boat handles in really rough waters. Other than that? Its a great looking boat and looks like it was proffessionally done. Enjoy!!"
205808,jwl,2008-05-24 22:56:00,1056,"good job on the boat man, I have a few things I want to do to my 14 footer as well but am taking added weight into factor..I am going to build cusions for the bench seats that can come on and off depending on fishing needs and hoiw many in the boat..it's rated for 4 people...but the rating is based on like 150lb people...come on now who goes fishing with..or even knows 4 fishing buds that only add up to 600lbs or so  not to mention that every little thing you add to the boat....bigger gas tank..battery for the accesories, electric motor and so on all does take away from the total load capacity of the boat.  I must say...you did an awesome job on the boat for sure..hope it treats you well this season"

205989,POLLIWOGG,2008-05-25 14:58:00,835,"Its not so much the weight as where you put it, when you put pedestal seats in these tinners and raise the weight so much higher than center of gravity you loose a lot of stability."

Stan, Brafaso for SS screws, Robert Bury for Marine Ply and Special Touch for marine vinyl... and for the alum, I used Maintence metals..

206600,sunfish,2008-05-26 18:54:00,57,Thats awesome!  So what does a job like that cost?  Great Job.
206695,Doctrt,2008-05-26 22:29:00,141," Nope.  All metal and wood is connected internally to the structure of the boat via the seats and the front tow eye.  The one exception is a hole I drilled below the tow eye to secure the front frame section to it.  Everything from there on is bolted together.  I had made a concious effort to not drill through the boat at all costs.  That's when leaks happen!!!  Although the bolts are accessible via compartments should they become loose, they were all ""lok tited"".    One suggestion I can give you, Fishinfool, is that Jumper Cables (with the ends clipped off), make for very inexpensive, heavy guage (4 or 6 guage) wire that can run the length of your boat for your Bow Mount (about $30 for 20ft).  Most bigger motors (mine is a 65 lb thruster) require fairly heavy wire as they can draw as high as 38 amps at a full stall, which would burn through anything lighter.  When I searched for Marine Grade wire (4 or 6) your looking at close to $7 a foot for a junk and neg.  If you like you can insulate it in a hose or piece of conduit.  Just make sure you also fuse the line.    We may be up this weekend actually.  Tonka boys got an itch, and that Kawarthacillin isn't working!    All things considered I probably only spent $500 to $600 for the floor and deck.  I could have spent a great deal more had I used all marine grade plywood, but instead I used 5/8 in Ply, pressure treated and sealed, as well as wrapped in carpet and lathered with carpet glue.  If it lasts me 5 years I'm ecstactic!  The Trolling motor was a steal at $340 and the two batteries, another $200.  After all is said and done, the whole boat has cost me about $2000 (I bought the boat and Johnson for $1000).  I'm not including the cost of my time - that would be depressing!  But what else are you gonna do when the rivers are frozen and you can't go ice fishing!"

210040,forrest,2008-06-03 02:53:00,1032, A good and funny read.  Maybe I should have mentioned the same thing happening to me b4.....and I am only 160lbs.  On lake Simcoe and without much force the bottom of the chair ripped out fro the non-marine grade plywood.  Luckily I did stay in the boat.  My immediate thoughts: if I built something similar I would use a large steel plate on the underside of the plywood that he seat could bolt into.  forrest

205118,HTHM,2008-05-23 01:19:00,4082,Well done!
205123,MoriaRiverMan,2008-05-23 01:22:00,314,I was going to do the exact same thing at the front on mine aswell..........but talked myself outa it thinking it may be to top heavy.  Ended up setting floor level at same height as rear.  Be curious to know if it is ok like it is.  Also got any pics of how u mounted the rear seat?  Want to change where and how mine were mounted.....
205135,Doctrt,2008-05-23 01:42:00,141,The way I looked at it I was standing on the seats all the time anyway.  The floor is now at that same level.  It's definitely not tippy the way it is.  Even with the trolling motor (which is the heaviest of all the upgrades).  As far as the seat goes I just carpetted the wood that was on the seat in the first place and bolted the swivel to the wood.  Here's a pic.  
205139,MoriaRiverMan,2008-05-23 01:46:00,314,sweet..........  going to add wood on the tops off my bench seats like that to..........  good idea  guy had bent aluminum brackets mounted on bench seat to bolt swivel seat to............dosent work so good............  will do mine like yours......

205175,pikehunter,2008-05-23 02:20:00,1659,"Looks good!  As you said the added weight in the bow would help to get her down when alone. And yes the possibility of it becoming top heavy could be a consideration and the fact that you have taken away some of the boats weight carrying capacity if you were to take along a couple of passengers, especially if they are on the heavy side. Just something to keep in mind."
