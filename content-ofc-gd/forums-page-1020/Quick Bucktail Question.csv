210461,MCTFisher9120,2008-06-03 22:20:00,3761,What color of Bucktail would some of you guys be throwing at different times of year(including this weekend). Would a Super Vibrax #5 work. Just reading what it says on the spinner blade. The color is orange with red feathers through it.The upper part of the bait is chartruse. (is that spelling right)  There i found a pic
210466,richyb,2008-06-03 22:30:00,774,I like that colour and also silver blade with black .....
210467,Billy Bob,2008-06-03 22:30:00,5865,"When you asked ""what color bucktail"" I immediately thought BLACK Bucktail JIGS but then I see you are referring to muskie fishing where I am NOT a good source of info. Walleye BLACK, smallmouth BLACK, largemouth BLACK, pike BLACK, muskie ????? I would try black but other muskie guys might have better info.  Good Luck, Bob"
210468,Zib,2008-06-03 22:35:00,369,I like brighter & lighter colors early in the season & dark colors late in the season.
210481,Weeds,2008-06-03 23:03:00,782,"If I recall correctly (which is not likely) 3 out of 4 of my muskies last year came on bucktails with black or black and red tails, all had silver blades.  I think 2 also had a white plastic Kalins grub on there as well.  My first Musky probably came mid to late June (so my experience might not apply to this years opener) and was a slopmaster, ""natural"" pattern/colour I think. Good Luck!! I've had very little luck with firetiger when fishing for anything but I know alot of people think highly of it."
210491,gone_fishin,2008-06-03 23:21:00,481,i agree with Black... probably the number one colour for muskies! the one in my avatar was on scugog with a double (2 section - 2 treble hook) black bucktail with silver blade. i'll be using that this weekend again on scugog.
210495,lew,2008-06-03 23:28:00,12767,The color of the bucktail in your picture will work just fine.  Just be sure the rest of your equipment will also handle a musky if you happen to hook one. You don't want her breaking your line and swimming off with those trebles locking her jaw shut.
210510,Rich Clemens,2008-06-04 00:00:00,3131,Just picked up a couple double cowgirls fromm Musky Tackle Online.  (gonna give them a bath in a few weeks).  One is black and the other is Black w/ some Red.  Another vote for Black.
210512,Musky or Specks,2008-06-04 00:06:00,2710,Mike thats my favourite bucktail for the kawarthas Got my second largest on it on Katchawanooka. A 47 incher heres a pick.      Had a big crowd for this one some touristy big sight seeing boat came by right as I hooked it everyone gathered at the rails and I held the fish up for them and got a round of applause
210515,MCTFisher9120,2008-06-04 00:11:00,3761,WOW
