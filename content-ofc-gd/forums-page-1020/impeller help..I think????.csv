209900,Guest buick14,2008-06-03 00:12:00,0,I just put in a new impeller in a 60 hp nissan  the little housing the impeller was in was giving me trouble putting in the impeller....so i used a little bit of grease and slid her in  I was later informed that I should not have done that.....................  Is that a problem???  Putting a little grease around the inner housing to allow the impeller to slip in easier???  any help and answers would be greatly appreciated!
210051,BFSC Kevin,2008-06-03 03:03:00,1351,well I'm thinking that because it is the water pump and that's where the water will come through... the water might push some of the grease and run it through the engine while cooling it and therefore interfering by getting clogged or??  but this is just a wild guess of mine....
