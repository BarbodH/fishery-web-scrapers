210319,Marty,2008-06-03 16:55:00,873,"Going into one of the toughest venues to play, down 3-1 against a much more experienced team and beating them in triple OT, that's impressive.   Two of their key players are in major slumps and their youth has hurt more than I thought it would.  The Pens are one game away from tying it up despite being outplayed for virtually the entire series.    ""Clearly on another level""?   I want what you're smoking.   This series is 3-2 and going back to Pittsburgh.  The Pens rarely outshoot their opponents.  They usually just make them count.   I'll take where we are."
210322,Stoty,2008-06-03 16:58:00,2910,"1) It wasnt the team that beat DET it was Fleury. 2) They didnt even score their 2nd goal, lucky bounce 3) Got a lucky bounce (again) to tie it with 30 secs left. 4) They had 3 PP in OT. (The first two looked like they had no idea what to do with an extra guy on the ice)  Being outshot, outhit, out chanced...I hardly find that impressive."
210337,Kirk,2008-06-03 17:14:00,347,"Its a young mans series now...lets see who has the legs after triple 0T.  I fell asleep in mid-2OT, my buddy (real big Wings fan) drove down to see the game, back in the office at 9am today feelin the pain.  30 seconds from winning the Cup, boy thats gotta hurt LOL  I smell game 7."
210339,Stoty,2008-06-03 17:18:00,2910,"Not as much as it is going to losing game 7!      wondered when you were going to pipe up! hey, how are you making out in the pool?"
210341,John,2008-06-03 17:20:00,2956, Isn't that playoff hockey?????????????
210375,Marty,2008-06-03 18:26:00,873,"Stoty, the way you whine it seems like your team is losing the series.   Feeling the pressure, eh?   If only we could get Malkin and Malone to wake up.  I'd be a little concerned if my team was ""dominating"" the series but still finds ways to lose.  Especially at home with a chance to eliminate a much lesser opponent, as some say.  The Wings PP is nothing to brag about either.  Fleury is a huge part of it but he doesn't score goals.   Every playoff team needs great goaltending.  You act as if it's something new.  Say what you want, nobody gave them a chance last night and they pulled it off despite very long odds.  Regardless of who wins the Cup, that was a big win for those guys.  If it gets that far, I'd love to watch a Game 7 with you.  Too bad we're so far apart."
210394,Stoty,2008-06-03 19:23:00,2910,I hardly think shelling out the facts is whining. PIT got lucky last night plain and simple. Det is just that much of a better team. They have dominated them in each game. Just shows what a hot goalie can do.  Are the Pens a good team? Yes Do they deserve to be there? Yes  Lets hope that the Pens actually show up tomorrow and force a game 7.
210412,Kirk,2008-06-03 20:02:00,347,"Fine, you beat me in the pool (and probably won it) after the scores in the first two games of the finals...I picked all Pens whenI was in 7th and everyone ahead of me was heavy into the Wings, hoping for Crosby Malkin and company having  a goalfest, but that didn't happen and even if detroit loses and its only by one goal I don't make up any significant ground...  Malkins been MIA for a while  so congrats to you cause I give credit where credits due (also Kudos for doing it without any trades)  This is my official surrender in the pool, unless Pens beat Detroit 10-0 in the next 2 games.  Really just glad to see a contest forming and I'd like to see Crosby hoist the Cup instead of the old timers getting it again for the fourth and fifth time."
210415,danbouck,2008-06-03 20:20:00,4380,  
210418,steve_paul,2008-06-03 20:26:00,658,"Go Leafs Go   (there now we can all have a laugh, get along, sing kumbaya, etc etc etc)"
210425,oncogene,2008-06-03 20:44:00,154," 3a) Fleury got away with an interference just be4 the goal there IMO... when Wings dumped the puck into Pens zone and Fleury got all the way out of his net to along the end board trying to block the Wings forechecker from getting to the puck. 3b) Zetterberg had the puck in the neutral zone and couldn't clear/shoot the puck (net was empty I think?) as the puck kept bouncing over his stick due to the bad ice.  If the goalie was being superman like Fleury did, eventually someone is gona scored, off a stupid mistake, a lucky bounce etc, even if their team isn't doing jack.... and to me that's exactly what happened there with Pens. They got a chance (oh wait, 3rd chance) off a stupid mistake by the highstick... AND a good bounce in their favour and scored... And that leads to:  5) During that final PP... Pens left pointman's shoot missed the net completely and was gona bounce over to Osgood's right side... the whole Wings PK unit looked/shifted/collapsed to the right side, naturally.... only to see the puck bounced off the linesman's butt and reversed its direction going back to the left side AND landed right on the stick of Malkin, who hadn't done a thing whole game. That 1 second of bouncing puck pretty much was the main reason why Sykora got opened up in the left slot.   I'm not a big fan of Detroit nor Pitts.... but I'd like the better team wins... which will be Detroit from what's been shown so far this series... by a mile and then some. Being a Canucks fans myself, this is all too familiar... when the whole team don't show up to play and it's all the superman goalie (Luongo) keeping the game close. I can't even count how many Canucks games I've watched this year that it's basically Team Luongo vs opponent Team. It's sad. Yesterday's Game 5 was exactly that for the Pens."
210554,pinerider,2008-06-04 01:48:00,8,"It's been great playoffs this year and here we are 1st week in June and hockey should be over this week. I remember the finals in the 6 team league being held the same weekend as opening for rainbow (1st wknd in May) Last night's game was great to watch, lots of action, lots of opportunities.  Shows how dominating a game doesn't mean much, scoring more goals wins games. I mispent my childhood being a Wings fan, was ready to jump back on the bandwagon, but I'd like to see Pittsburgh win too.  I'll wait for game 7 and flip a coin."
210655,Stoty,2008-06-04 12:18:00,2910,well said oncogene! Lots of great points there.  Zetts will (hopefully) hoist Lord Stanley's Cup tonight!!! wooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo  GO WINGS GO!
210662,beerman,2008-06-04 12:30:00,118,"Hi guys, I am from pittsburgh and I live 20 minutes from the city. The city is going nuts right now. Geez, I cannot even concentrate on work.. A few things, its been a great ride. Great games and fun stuff to watch. The wings have looked really great in all the games. I think right now though the Penguins will take over. Its just a gut feeling.. I will be at the game tonight, with the other 18,000 pens fans.. Its a white out and the Igloo will rock.. One thing I did notice is, the Pittsburgh crowd is WAYYYYYYYYYYYY more into it than the detroit fans.. I thought detroit was hockeytown???    GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO PENS"
210666,Stoty,2008-06-04 12:34:00,2910," Ya because they only sold the tickets to the PITTS area! Which I am still VERY ticked about. Its pathetic actually. ""We dont want DET fans in the building"" is what I am taking from it. Thats not what sport is about. Nothing wrong with a little competition."
210672,beerman,2008-06-04 12:36:00,118,"I don,t think you are right stoty.. The games are all sold out. 1,000 tickets went on sale yesterday and they sold them in 3 minutes. First come, first serve... And they were all standing room only seats.. I actually could of went to game 5 in detroit. They had over 5,000 seats left. Not good.."
210674,Stoty,2008-06-04 12:38:00,2910,Believe me....on ticketmaster they only sold tickets to the PITS area. I was online waiting for them to go on sale. Only to have that notice pop up 2 mins before they went on sale. I wasnt a happy camper.
210675,Stoty,2008-06-04 12:40:00,2910,"Here is the blurb.....directly from ticketmaster right now.  ""Additional Information: Mellon Arena is located in Pittsburgh, PA.

210111,Rich Clemens,2008-06-03 10:46:00,3131,"Let's not start counting those chickens before they hatch (but, I have to be honest and say I thought it would end last night too)."
210150,John,2008-06-03 12:14:00,2956,"I thought that it was all over too Rich. Detroit were beating them to every puck. If Pens win the next one, what a game 7!!!!!!!!!!!"
210151,Stoty,2008-06-03 12:18:00,2910,"How it is unreal to think you are going to win the cup when there is 30 second left??  I hope it goes to Game 7 now too, and watch Pittsburgh fall apart.  By the way.....is that Malkin guy even playing?"
210154,John,2008-06-03 12:33:00,2956," As much as I hate to do it, I agree will you Stoty. That's what happens when young gun talent gets overwhelmed by the pressure. I would like to see them win this year, but next is probably more likely."
210158,Stoty,2008-06-03 12:37:00,2910, ........
210160,Marty,2008-06-03 12:40:00,873,"Malkin and Malone have been invisible.  We wouldn't be here without them but it sure would be nice to see them show up for a game in the finals.  Boy, sure is fun here in Pittsburgh."
210161,JohnF,2008-06-03 12:47:00,3494," Malkin has been anything but invisible, wallowing around looking for ever better giveaways to pull off.  I suspect most Pitts fans wish he would be more invisible in that department.  He carried the team for a quite a while while Crosby was down. Mebbe he's just worn out, physically and mentally.  JF"
210165,Stoty,2008-06-03 12:57:00,2910, 
210198,Marty,2008-06-03 13:41:00,873,"If he can pull up his pants and play like he did all year, we can give Stoty some anxiety.    He made some plays last night but he's just not finishing the job."
210201,muskymike,2008-06-03 13:42:00,772,Spezza?
210206,anders,2008-06-03 13:55:00,1168, I dont know about that...the puck found Malone's face all night...ouch!  Malkin....well....he is creating more turnovers than Tim Hortons's.  The wings wont lose 3 in a row...the Pens are just delaying the inevitable
210208,Marty,2008-06-03 14:00:00,873,"Maybe, maybe not . . .  The Arena will be rocking.  You may think so but I think our youngins aren't so sure the Wings won't lose 3 in a row.  What they showed last night was pretty impressive.   Everyone, including me, wrote them off.  Sometimes the ignorance of youth pays off.  By the way, the kick save Fleury made on the two man break was pretty unbelievable.   Wow!"
210213,Stoty,2008-06-03 14:06:00,2910, WHO????  The only thing impressive about PIT last night was Fleury.  What game were you watching last night?? You think PIT actually outplayed DET?????
210224,Puckhead,2008-06-03 14:30:00,377,"Fleury was amazing...  Any other tender and it's 5-2.  I haven't seen a Stanley Cup final preformance in net like that since Roy stole game 6 in 01.  Detroit dominated Pittsburgh in every aspect of the game, minus goaltending, after the first period and should be the cup champs right now...  Fleury could just steal one this year - the same way that Roy and Brodeur have done in years past.  Unbelievable how he played last night and there is no reason to think he isn't going to play the same in games 6 and 7."
210228,steve_paul,2008-06-03 14:37:00,658," Yup, final score PIT 4 Det 3.  How it got to the end is not what matters, it is the final that matters.  And it's ok Stoty, having to wait a couple more days for a parade won't kill ya.  I been waiting 41 years and am still kicking."
210231,JohnAB,2008-06-03 14:41:00,178,"If Malkin ever showed up for a game this series would be a dandy. Even Staal last night was lost. Conn Smythe trophy better be going to Fleury as without him, this series would have been done in 4.  I do not think Detroit really wanted a game 5 like this. They totally dominated but still lost. Man that has to be a bit deflating for them and a serious boost for the Pens. Game 6 should be good and Detroit best be careful as Malkin has to come out of his funk soon and then look out as Crosby and him both rolling will be pretty tough to deal with."
210243,Stoty,2008-06-03 15:05:00,2910,"Wow, if you think that PIT outplayed DET last night.....then there must have been a few too many pints consumed during the game."
210248,steve_paul,2008-06-03 15:11:00,658," Quantify too many  And where it matters most, Pittsburgh topped Detroit.  Now on to game 6.  Hope the Pens win that one too, would love to be able to sit back and relax at the trailer this weekend with a bonfire, box of beer and Game 7 on the tube."
210279,JohnAB,2008-06-03 16:06:00,178,"Stoty, you saying I said Pit dominated last nite? If you think that you better reread my post."
210285,Stoty,2008-06-03 16:18:00,2910,"JohnAB, wasnt talking about you.  A few others seem to think that PIT outplayed DET last night."
210286,Headhunter,2008-06-03 16:18:00,5703,"Did anyone else notice that the refs seemed to have become fans with the best seat in the house? Man, there were un-called penalties from the 10 minute mark of the third until the end of the game. Now, before you all come down on me for that statement, I prefer a wide open game, but holy clutch, grab, hold, trip... dude that scored the tying goal took a cross check to the head right after it went in... Looking forward to 7 games and watchin Gary Roberts carry the cup again... I'll just pretend he's wearing a leaf uniform under his Penns jersey! HH"
210289,Stoty,2008-06-03 16:20:00,2910, If he can even lift his arms above his head....that is.
210299,Puckhead,2008-06-03 16:32:00,377,"Hmmm... 2:1 SOG, almost 3:1 possession and basically winning every puck battle from one end to the other... I dunno, maybe it's just me, but I think Detroit not only outplayed Pittsburgh, but basically beat the crap out of them all over the ice.  Fleury stole the game and may very well steal the cup the way he's playing but make no mistake about it, Detroit is a complete team from front to back and clearly on a different level than the Pens.  It's amazing watching that team play..."

210306,kgroen,2008-06-03 16:39:00,4,"triple OT, what a game.  the pens lucked out getting outshot that badly."
209206,Stoty,2008-06-01 03:32:00,2910,"Not looking good for the pens! Just like predicted, the more experienced Red Wings are showing them how its done!  1 more to go!!!! woooooooo"
209210,kennyman,2008-06-01 03:40:00,737,"Yep, the Pens are done. I doubt they'll win another one, but I still hope they do? You had to know the Wings would win the series. My brain said the Wings, but my heart said Pens. I hope the Wings put Chelios back in, he deserves to be there for the cup win."
209213,danc,2008-06-01 03:47:00,4677, They're still playing hockey?? I never would have guessed.
209220,jediangler,2008-06-01 04:17:00,1923,That defensive play Zetterberg made on Crosby at the side of the net during the 5 on 3 was amazing. And what a slapshot by Lidstrom.
209227,oncogene,2008-06-01 04:41:00,154,Good game Wings!!!
209228,gone_fishin,2008-06-01 04:43:00,481,  i think that's how most of us felt! i hope the pens pull at least one more win out of the series!
209230,GBW,2008-06-01 04:59:00,8460,I would love to see Roberts bring the cup to Whitby.  But that seems like a dream now...
209254,Gerritt,2008-06-01 11:54:00,6129,Absolute Laziness on the Pens behalf.. it was sad to watch them just float around the ice..  Malkin was driving me insane. you see a guy with the puck you hit him on the way to the bench!  They deserve to lose this series if play like this continue..  Not to mention the cry baby antics @ the end of the game..  G
209260,MCTFisher9120,2008-06-01 12:09:00,3761,Nope Pittsburgh is going to win it all.
209261,Spiel,2008-06-01 12:14:00,9065," ....You didn't know Dan? You oughta check in here more often, it's how I stay informed."
209297,bucktail,2008-06-01 16:06:00,1857,"Malkin really is the laziest player in the NHL, wouldnt trade for him for a bag of pucks. 2 Way play  and proper positional hockey is showing the gap between these teams. Picked the wings in 6 but it sure looks like 5 now!"
209298,Stoty,2008-06-01 16:11:00,2910,"Ya, its almost as though the Pens aren't even trying. They have been totally outplayed in every aspect of the game. Its too bad because they are one of the most skilled (if not the most) skilled team in the league.   I totally agree. I have never seen a player cry so much about everything (getting hit, losing, etc). Its sad to watch."
209366,Billy - Curtiss,2008-06-01 21:38:00,241,This has been unfortunately one of the most boring Stanley Cup finals in quite some time. I don't care for either team but I don't at all enjoy the style of hockey Detroit plays though it's obviously working for them. I couldn't believe that Malkin getting hauled down and sent flying into the Detroit net wasn't called. The ridiculously inconsistent officiating in the NHL these days all around makes it tough to watch for me. I found this to be pretty much the case all season long.
209474,holdfast,2008-06-02 01:27:00,1813,"Yup, can't wait till Detroit wins and kisses each other."
209667,Stoty,2008-06-02 14:08:00,2910,Tonight could be the night!!!  The playoff pool is mighty close!  Here's hoping for a big Detroit win tonight!
209672,danbo,2008-06-02 14:23:00,2646,
209689,Stoty,2008-06-02 15:03:00,2910,No random picture this time? Disappointing.
209691,Marty,2008-06-02 15:11:00,873,"Detroit is just too experienced.  Say all you want about the Pens but for such a young team, they played tough.  Game 1 was tight until mid 3rd period.   Game 2 was bad.  Game 3 a win and Game 4 went down to the wire and the Pens had far better chances than the Wings.  They just couldn't pull it off.  Youth is getting the better of them but the Wings are very good.  They don't make stupid mistakes and make you pay when you commit some, which the Pens did quite a bit.  I'm glad I get to this these guys in Pittsburgh for some time.  Rather be here than dealing with the mess in TO.  The Wings deserve it.  They are the better team."
209699,Kirk,2008-06-02 15:36:00,347,"16th game is the hardest to win, Pens have the youth to launch a comeback, one game at a time.  Detroits gonna be lazy tonight with a 3-1 cushion, Pens fighting for their lives. Its the old rabbit running for his life and the fox running just for lunch.  3-2, back to the igloo,  Pens won't lose at home 3-3  Anything can happen in game 7, momentum with the Pens,  Pens in 7   Easy as that.  It ain't over till the fat lady returns to her bag of chips backstage"

209734,Stoty,2008-06-02 17:14:00,2910,"The Red Wings arent going to sit back tonight. Being at home (in which they are unbeaten), to win the cup?  Det is going to come out flying. 4-2 Det tonight. Its going to the the best game of the series though, cause Pits has no choice but to show up tonight. Det is by far the superior team though.  Pits wont lose at home? (Game 4)"
209747,JohnAB,2008-06-02 17:26:00,178,"This series reminds me a lot of 1983. Young upstart Oilers against the powerhouse Isles. Oilers learned the first time, next year they dominated. Pens are going to be a major force to deal with and Detroit, this is like their last hurrah, age is catching up with them."
209752,Stoty,2008-06-02 17:30:00,2910,"I (kinda) agree with that John. Pens will be a force to reckon with in the next couple years (as long as they keep everyone signed). I think they will win it next year.  But Det isnt that old, they only have a few old players, which will be finished within the next 2 seasons. All their top players are still fairly young. Zetts, Datsyuk, Franzen, Hudler, etc will all be around for a while, so Det will continute to be a top contender the next few years."
210091,Marty,2008-06-03 04:57:00,873,Dang Kirk.   Prophet?    Stoty?    Even I may be wrong.    Feels good to be a Pens fan.
210110,MCTFisher9120,2008-06-03 10:43:00,3761,"And Pittsburgh wins the game 4-3....it's unreal the Detroit fans thought they had the cup in the last minute of the 3rd, bahahahaha. I hope we get a 7 game series.  LETS GO PENS!!!!!"
