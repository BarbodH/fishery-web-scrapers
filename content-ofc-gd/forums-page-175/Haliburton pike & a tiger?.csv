915747,fishboy,2015-05-19 02:05:00,550,"I was out Saturday for a few hours and managed to boat & release 5 pike-nothing huge but averaging about 24"".  I also landed what I think was a tiger? The lake has both pike and muskie as I've caught both personally.  What's the consensus?  Out of curiosity, what are the regs on a tiger muskie...pike season and limits or muskie?  "

915750,chris.brock,2015-05-19 02:20:00,4053,"I say tiger.  It seems like when pike recently invade muskie water, tigers are more common."
915751,cram,2015-05-19 02:24:00,1733,Nice catch!  That's a super pretty fish
915760,Sinker,2015-05-19 03:26:00,8692, Ive noticed the same.  S.
915777,dave524,2015-05-19 12:07:00,4508,"I'll say it's a pike, juveniles often have that barred appearance turning to spotted as they mature and the fins look too rounded for a hybrid."

915793,jimmer,2015-05-19 14:18:00,2730,100% tiger.
915795,fishnsled,2015-05-19 14:30:00,3520,"I'd say tiger and a beauty fish too.  Rounded tail, markings on the cheek and the ""tiger strips"" are a good give away. (Chin pores are another) I hope all is well in the Hammer, great to see you getting some water time in."
915809,BillM,2015-05-19 17:29:00,17367,I think that's a bit big to still be a juvenile pike with the vertical stripes.  I'd guess Tiger.

(Chin pores are another) I hope all is well in the Hammer, great to see you getting some water time in. Things are great, and an interesting debate-as I half expected   . In any event a pretty cool looking fish.  Maybe due for a repeat visit to Cameron?"
915856,TenInchJake,2015-05-20 00:02:00,21,I'll just leave this here.....(I'm with the tiger guys) 
915878,PUMP KNOWS,2015-05-20 01:54:00,937,Nice markings
915999,fishnsled,2015-05-20 19:16:00,3520,.  Maybe due for a repeat visit to Cameron? That would be great!  It's been far too long since the last one.
