We have great fishing right here but the unique thing about FLA whether fishing salt water or brackish water is you never know what you are going to hook into. From Sea Trout to Shark. I would use lighter tackle compared to the locals using 2X2's and chainfalls and always hooked up 3 times more than they did, and I lost a lot of tackle even using 100 pound flouro leaders."
