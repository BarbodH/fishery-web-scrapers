Was wondering if anyone knew how the fishing was in the area and what species can be found. Have to admit Im not too familiar with the area but would love to wet a line this weekend.  Any advice is appreciated!"

915423,Toronto_Angler,2015-05-16 13:52:00,698,Would be shore or near shore as I will have access to a tinny but don't want to get onto the big water with it.
