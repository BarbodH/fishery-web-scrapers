916537,manitoubass2,2015-05-24 01:47:00,11391,Me too!  F this im eating musky from now on
916415,manitoubass2,2015-05-23 02:12:00,11391,  Apparently this musky took a walk through couchiching lol.  Geez
916416,leaf4,2015-05-23 02:13:00,2466,"That's a hog! I wonder what he did with it, mount or eat lol"
916418,Joeytier,2015-05-23 02:15:00,3990,I can smell it from here
916419,Gallie,2015-05-23 02:16:00,1215,Well unless its from the long long ago i hope he didnt catch it in couchiching.... They are having a hard time getting them to stick there for some reason?
916426,Joey,2015-05-23 02:50:00,9122,Is this a recent pic?
916427,manitoubass2,2015-05-23 02:54:00,11391,"Couchiching first nations in NW ontario.  Pic is from today. My exes sisters boyfriend lol.  Apperently he took it to a daycare to show the kids, then ate it.  I dont know though. Looks like its been outta the water for awhile(pukes in mouth)"
916429,manitoubass2,2015-05-23 02:56:00,11391,And it was +25 here today
916441,Old Ironmaker,2015-05-23 09:44:00,8243,"I tried Musky years ago before they were considered as holy as a Hindu cow. It was not a big one, maybe mid 30's and it tasted like Bass minus the ""B"". That is a big fish, looks more like road kill than a fresh Musky. Maybe it was in that parking lot when it got hit."
916454,davey buoy,2015-05-23 12:26:00,5505,You pull the picture Rick?.
916456,manitoubass2,2015-05-23 12:50:00,11391,Yeah.  I felt bad. Hes a good guy and i dont wanna paint him as a bad guy.  Still wish he woulda released the fish though. But its his legal right to harvest so what can ya do
916458,kickingfrog,2015-05-23 13:17:00,8333,"""What can you do?"" Say ""No thank you"" if he asks you over for fish diner.  No issues with someone keeping whatever for sustenance but that would be just about last on my list."
916460,Gallie,2015-05-23 13:55:00,1215,I agree with kickinfrogs statement.
916463,manitoubass2,2015-05-23 14:39:00,11391," But if you seen the pic, it looks like its been outta the water for hours. So I dont really believe he ate it.  But thats his call i guess and not mine.  Wicked fish though. Gotta be pushing 53"""
916478,NAW,2015-05-23 16:45:00,4022,Put the pic back up!  I'm curious.  Even though I'm sure I don't want to see it..  I want to see it!  Like the two girls one cup video..
916479,manitoubass2,2015-05-23 16:50:00,11391,Check your messages
916493,Terry,2015-05-23 19:26:00,14456,Put the pic back up!  I'm curious.  Even though I'm sure I don't want to see it..  I want to see it!  Like the two girls one cup video.. you just had to make me look I am going to have nightmares over that
916494,leaf4,2015-05-23 19:27:00,2466,LOL
916497,musky666,2015-05-23 19:56:00,126,Two years back I had a big girl die on me- took the double bladed bait way deep and I couldn't save her. I felt so bad- luckily I was meeting a fellow fisherman later in the day on the lake- I texted him and he said he would eat her. I got 4 big slabs 'o meat off her and he said it wasn't too bad. At least I didn't have to let her drift away...
916505,Paudash,2015-05-23 21:34:00,273,Worked at a trailer park on Chemong lake near Peterborough 30 years ago and every day I would see people bring them in to eat.  I could  never figure it out because I was always told you were not suppose to eat them as per my Dad
916510,manitoubass2,2015-05-23 22:03:00,11391,Hahahahhahaha
916519,lew,2015-05-23 22:53:00,12766,"Saw the pic when you 1st posted it Rick, that was a very impressive fish for sure."
916524,outllaw,2015-05-23 23:45:00,1232,reality check. he ate it. not my choice but it was not wasted..years back we also ate musky. .not exactly a fish I would line up at a dinner for lol.
916532,manitoubass2,2015-05-24 01:37:00,11391,"No way to tell other then his word  But if im keeping any fish, its gonna be kept cold and alive as long as possible.this fish looked like it had seen better days.  It doesnt take long for a fish to turn to mush. And parading the fish in +25 temps doesnt help matters.  But if he ate it good enough. Like i said, its legal. I just dont agree with it"
916535,irishfield,2015-05-24 01:42:00,26272,"Last time I saw it.. it looked in pretty good condition. Had been set on the grass and was dirty, but the eyeball was still very defined and fresh looking! I hear they're good steaked !"
916536,Fisherpete,2015-05-24 01:46:00,1814,"First muskie I ever caught was a 36"" Kawartha fish that inhaled my lure and didn't make it. We ate it and I have to say it was just like pike... a bit firmer though. But I'll bet a big old fifty would not be all that tasty lol."
