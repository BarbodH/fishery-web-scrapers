916403,Joeytier,2015-05-23 00:45:00,3990,"Not many trout reports these days, so I thought I'd share my trip from today...  Spent a full day on the water chasing specks and greys (something I do a lot) on the fly rod (something I never do!) and it was an absolute blast, despite the absolutely horrid conditions.  And by horrid, I mean borderline gale force north wind, subzero temps and intermittent snowsqualls ALL day.  Despite this, we boated 3 nice size specks and the 14-17"" lakers were non-stop action all day as per usual for this lake.  Used mostly leech flies and wooly buggers on a full-sink line, and I can't wait to do it again!  Took home our 4 lakers, plus the specks making for a meal fit for kings!
