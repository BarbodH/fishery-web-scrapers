916140,scugpg,2015-05-21 16:35:00,1373,I'm debating whether to take advantage of rebates and get a Gen 2 touch or go with a new gen3 unit.  Anyone have experiences with them yet or have used both? Wondering which route to go and if it's worth it to go gen3. Chirp and actual buttons on the gen3 have my interest.  Thanks
916155,ecmilley,2015-05-21 17:33:00,2163,Yes have used both the gen 3 is nice but hardly noticble differences over gen2 i would get the gen2 touch for differencenin price
916156,G.mech,2015-05-21 17:38:00,830,The newest software update for the Gen 2 touch (version 4.0) makes it look and operate very much the same as the Gen 3 units with a lot of the new Gen 3 functions built in.  It is a lot different than the version 3  but has a lot of nice new features as well... check it out before you decide one way or the other.

I was set to pick up and ipilot unit off a guy I know, and came across a guy selling a slightly used XI5 on here.  He showed me all the features of his new unit linked in to a gen 3 and it blew my mind a bit.  I ended up buying the XI5 instead (which is unbelieavable by the way). Gen 3 is a bit out of my price range as I just got a Raymarine unit, but I will be looking for a used gen2 to replace my bowmount with eventually so I can link the XI5. I don't know how much practical experience you will hear about this side of the border yet.  Most guys are probably just getting into the swing of things with them.  He did mention that the Gen 2 updates brought the 2/3 into  pretty close competition.  I have chirp on my Ray.  The jury is still out on this as far as I'm concerned, even after using it all weekend.  You could try looking for more info on walleye central.  Those guys are pretty hardcore when it comes to the latest and greatest and no doubt there will be a bunch of guides that have used the gen 3 a lot."
