Actually it has an appropriate name, a Raptor is after all a dinosaur.  Actually before Toronto had a NBA team I associated Raptors with Birds of Prey, hawks, eagles and falcons, but then I was a avid birder in my younger days. Between the team and the movie Jurassic Park people pretty much think of dinos now. My present ride is an 06 Jeep Liberty with 69000 kms on it, solid little suv that tows fairly well, maybe harder on gas than some but then I don't drive many klms in a year."

The Hyundai Excel we got for my ex doesn't count. $7200,00 out of the showroom, all in.  Someone spent a lot of money on the engine before rust got to her, the GMC not the ex.

LOL  This 86 Corvette was one of my customer's cars; that I had worked on it for at least 20 years. The lady that owned it (Original owner) came into the shop one day, about 6 or 7 years ago and asked if I wanted to buy it? She told me a crazy low price; but it came with a condition. I was not to sell it until she passes away; she didn't want to see the car go too someone that would destroy it. Her reason for selling it was that at 72 she couldn't get in or out of the car very easily. I kept true to my word; but I did give the car to my daughter, as a law school grad gift. Michelle had her first ride in the car when she was 7 years old. The owner had seen Michelle checking out the Vette and offered to take her around the block in it. Michelle was hooked and fell in love with it; so it was only fitting for her to have it. I keep telling her, she has to stop polishing it; she going to rub the paint off it.  "

Back when I was about 14 or 15 my buds older brother souped up a 47 Ford and put in a big motor, although I don't know what it was.  It had a 3 speed column shift and to be ""fancy"" he put a chrome ball on the end of the shifter. He took the pair of us out one day to show us how fast the car was. Took off from a light screaming in 1st gear, then when he slammed it up into 2nd the chrome ball flew off and busted his windshield.

Dad had a 51 Chev when I was born, your's is very similar to the one I have seen pictures of. I remember chewing on the leather seats of his 55 Chev 2 door hard top, hey I was 4, Hunters green and white, what a beauty that was. He doesn't remember what exactly powered it but it was an 8, probably small block. I called him inside and the identical 55 was being sold on Barrett Jacksons auction many years ago while we were watching TV. It went for over 100K. He couldn't believe it  I've sold them all and am kicking my butt for it now. But that was at a time when I needed to buy a roof for over my head. I was well on my way to putting together a cool collection as I never sold a vehicle I ever had until I was 24 and got married. I had parked in my uncles barn, 63 Pontiac Parisian 2 door hard top, 65 Chev Impala 2 door SS, 65 Ford Galaxy 500,  67 MGB, 70 Ford T-Bird, 2 door hard top, 69 Mercedes Benz 280S, 70 Ford Econoline Van (shaggin waggin), 72 Triumph TR-6, 76 Chev Monte Carlo, 76 L-88 Corvette. Plus I had a 73 Harley Sportster and a Hard Tail that was 5 different bikes of different years. I sold them all in the summer of 79 to put the down stroke on my first matrimonial home. Then I bought a 79' Audi 5000s and drove it for 9 years as the family car. Then after I got divorced I started another collection and sold all of them in 1996 when I took my early pension and took that money to buy a cottage. The 2 cars I wish I still had was the 72 Triumph TR6 and 83 Benz 560 SEC 2 door 5.6 litre rocket (from my second collection), both were beauties, I was more into the European stuff for some crazy reason.  If I had a few of those first cars now I think 500K wouldn't be an exaggeration for what they are going for at auction. An identical 69 Benz went for over 100K USD last week on Barrett Jacksons, maybe more because that when I shut off the TV in disgust!  My 3rd vehicle is a 19 foot StarCraft now.

Halfway through an intersection, you'd be looking for second gear; out on the hwy trying to do 60mph, the tac was running about 4200 rpm. With today's type of driving, I knew that the poor old 6 wouldn't be around for long; not without blowing it up. Now at 60mph with the 290hp injected engine, overdrive trans and a 3:42 gear, the engine is running about 1200rpm. I love it pulling out onto the 401; everyone is trying there best to stay in front of me. (They don't want to get stuck behind an old car.) They give up most times, when they realize I'm 3 or 4 car lengths ahead of them before I leave the on ramp. LOL  Lew. I have a customer that has a 64 Chevy convertible with a 283cu"" in it.

Used to be a car would go down the street and you instantly new the year, the model and probably what engine was in it.  Today they all look the same going down the road and I don't know if it's a Honda or a Rolls Royce"
912596,DanD,2015-04-27 19:30:00,2223,"I know what you mean Lew. I'm a mechanic, working the trade and I have to go looking at the nameplate or run the VIN too see what the hell it is. Oh sure it's a Ford Focus; but what sub model is it. The 2Lt engine Focus has 10 different subs; that all carry different options for suspension, steering, brakes and body differences. LOL  Dan."
912603,Old Ironmaker,2015-04-27 20:26:00,8243,"As Lew said those were the days you knew exactly what year and model a car was going down the road. We lived at a stop and would play a game sitting on the front stoop. The first kid to call ""it"" won. Today my wife will ask me what type of car is this or that, until I can see the badge on the trunk I have no clue. Trucks are more recognizable but cars, who knows? A mass of plastic is just that. In the 60's an uncle had a Studebaker Avanti, now there was a car.  They say they don't make things the way they used to, in most cases that's definitely true. Cars today are light years ahead of those classics. My 63 Parisienne  didn't have power steering or power brakes. Turning the wheel was a workout and if you wanted to stop fast you better start a block ahead of where you want to stop. I have used the emergency brakes many times back in the day.. Most people today don't even know where the emergency break is. I was told by someone they didn't have an emergency brake but they have a parking brake, that would be my beautiful wife.  I don't want to hijack this thread so I will ask Dan, what was your favorite car over the years?"
912606,lew,2015-04-27 20:35:00,12766,"In the 60's an uncle had a Studebaker Avanti, now there was a car.   Studebaker had some really flashy cars back then and one of my favorites was the Hawk."
912614,DanD,2015-04-27 21:01:00,2223,"I don't want to hijack this thread so I will ask Dan, what was your favorite car over the years?  Oh that's easy. 1969 Chevelle Malibu SS 396 cu"", 4 speed manual and 3:73 gear. Back then you could special order cars and change up things as the car was being built. My dad would not help my brother finance this car; if he thought it was a ""sports car"". To dad anything with bucket seats was one; so my brother ordered this SS with a bench seat. LOL   Just an on-line pic.  That was my first car; I bought it off of my brother, when it was 6 years old and pretty tired from the beating he gave it. I was 15 then and spent the best part of the next year getting it ready for a safety and for me to get my driver's license. OH man the memories of the street racing and the view from the back seat at the drive-in (what movie was that?). I sold it and have never found another that I could afford to buy; but some day I'll find one. Hopefully, I;ll still be able to get into the back seat. LOL  Dan."
912619,DanD,2015-04-27 21:23:00,2223,"Sorry to double post. But studebakers were way too far ahead of the times, compared to the other manufactures; people didn't understand the cost difference. They were the first to make seat belts, double latching doors, safety hooks for hoods, reinforcement beams inside passenger doors, dual braking system as standard equipment; the list is long, with all their attempts to make their cars the safest ones out there.  Even my 50, seat belts were not even an option, when it left the factory; if you wanted them, you'd have the dealer install them at a large (relative terms) fee.  Dan."

I actually found the time 2 Falls ago to get one of mine running.. well yah it is a Chrysler product, it required a battery and turning the key after sitting for 8 years!  I've ignored a good friend for way too long. It's been at least 7 years since we spent any quality time together. Today I made the effort and had an enjoyable few hours with her. The reward was hearing her sing again and in appreciation I gave her a nice sponge bath!"
912631,Joeytier,2015-04-27 22:27:00,3990,"My beast...'13 Sierra 5.3.  It's too bad its getting so hard to find a half ton in a extra cab/long bed configuration.  Guess I'll have to spend a lot of time with this one.    It's got a Flowmaster super 10 exhaust setup with Gibson headers and a custom Diablosport 91 octane tune, and just a 2"" front level and 33"" rubber for some extra clearance.  Think I'm done with the engine work but id like to add an extra leaf sometime soon.  Don't like the rear end sag when my snowmobiles in the box."
