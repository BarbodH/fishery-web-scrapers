916752,shimano19,2015-05-25 01:19:00,196,"Thanks SPOOLED, I think I'm going to go with the 12 seems like the best bet. Thanks john I appreciate the help. And drifter I've been looking into the 4 blade and I think I'll stick with the 3 I actually wouldn't mind trying one before I picked that up"
916795,shimano19,2015-05-25 11:42:00,196,Also those results were with 3 people in the boat. If I have 2 people in the boat would it affect my rpms? I would have a greater top speed but would my rpms raise or lower?
916803,scugpg,2015-05-25 13:03:00,1373,Less people would mean higher rpm and more speed. So 11p is definitely too small pitch.
916805,shimano19,2015-05-25 13:17:00,196,With the 12p will my holeshot be slower than the 11p?
916809,scugpg,2015-05-25 13:43:00,1373,Most likely yes. Think of it as taking off in second gear rather than first in a car. Starts slower but goes faster once it gets moving.
916819,shimano19,2015-05-25 14:51:00,196,"Okay I'll give it a shot, I'm looking for it to stay around 6000rpm and get somewhat the same speed"
916168,Mister G,2015-05-21 19:56:00,1429,"It has power trim, maybe I was to much over trimmed, and they are installed in the second or third hole This statement doesn't sit well with me.  If you have power trim/tilt your motor should be set on the last (lowest) trim hole so you have full trim capabilities. Do this before spending a lot of money on a new prop."
916270,shimano19,2015-05-22 11:01:00,196,"Not sure the diameter but the pitch is 13.  MisterG I got my boat second hand, the motor was mounted by the marina on the 3rd hold from the top. i can tilt the motor up and down by a button, when I start I trim all the way down, and the prop faces down slightly rather than horizontal"
916284,BillM,2015-05-22 11:39:00,17367,It should be stamped right on the prop 13-XX

Can you post a pic with the motor down looking @ the back of the boat? It's possible the motor is not mounted high enough and causing too much drag. With the motor straight up and down the cavitation plate should be about 1"" below the bottom of the boat.  Take the pic from a low angle (cavitation plate height) so we can get a good look."
916322,Stef,2015-05-22 16:39:00,63,"Yeah... motor mount to position the cavitation plate not being correct sure fits the symptoms being described to a tee.

The problem was the on plug coil pack on the bottom cylinder was not properly plugged in so it wasn't firing. I pulled the plugs one at a time to check how they looked.

916328,NANUK,2015-05-22 17:33:00,797,Are you sure 13 is the pitch ? Sounds like diameter to me
916330,DRIFTER_016,2015-05-22 17:37:00,10439,Yes it's the pitch. Diameter is first on the prop sizing. Also pitch is sized in whole inches not fractional.
916336,shimano19,2015-05-22 18:11:00,196,I'll check the plate and make sure the coils are plugged in correctly once I get home. Thanks
916343,scugpg,2015-05-22 18:51:00,1373,If it's mounted on the 3rd from top holes I'd be surprised if the cav plate isn't close to the bottom of hull except if it's an x-longshaft motor.

Thanks  Do yourself a favour if the coils are plugged in properly check the plugs to make sure they have all been firing. Could have a dead plug if it is not the coil connection. I bought brand new plugs for my old engine once and had a dud.
916357,Big Cliff,2015-05-22 20:07:00,6899,"Have the same engine on a Princecraft 164. Top speed about 32 mph, I never push mine past about 5000 rpm but it will go a little higher.  On plane in under 30 seconds with one or two people in the boat, a bit longer with 4 people depending on where they are sitting. Excellent engine, quiet and fuel efficient. Bought mine new and baby it a bit but love it to pieces."
916359,DRIFTER_016,2015-05-22 20:12:00,10439,DANG!!! 60 seconds to get on plane? I thought my boat was slow. With the old 90 two stroke it took me about 2-2 1/2 boat lengths to get on step. With my new 115 four stroke and spitfire prop I get on step in a boat length!!!!
916367,Big Cliff,2015-05-22 20:59:00,6899,"Sorry, re thought that, not 60 seconds, more like 30 or less."
916611,shimano19,2015-05-24 17:51:00,196,With new 11 pitch prop I hit 31mph at 6100rpm but I don't like pushing it past 5800rpm so I keep it there and get about 28mph with 3 people. Still lower than other people are getting. Merc says this motor performs best at 5500-6000rpm
916644,scugpg,2015-05-24 19:41:00,1373,Good to hear you got the rpms up but yes they're a little high. Any chance you could try a 12p? Might strike the right balance for your setup.
916663,shimano19,2015-05-24 20:36:00,196,"I'm thinking about doing that, I wonder if I'll get the same speeds with the 12. With the 11 if I adjust the tilt to sit level I can have it at WOT and just below 6000rpm. As I raise the tilt I will gain more rpm so I'd have to let off the throttle"
916685,scugpg,2015-05-24 21:51:00,1373,Might even be slightly faster with a 12.
916699,shimano19,2015-05-24 22:55:00,196,Why do you say that spooled?
916701,Sinker,2015-05-24 23:14:00,8692,"It will drop rpms, and increase speed. Prop pitch is basically inches of boat travel per turn of prop. 12 pitch, 12"" per turn......something like that anyways.  You were over propped with the original, now slightly under propped.  12P should be the sweet spot.  S."
916704,scugpg,2015-05-24 23:16:00,1373,"Higher pitch generally results in faster speed but lower rpms. So if your maxed out at 6100 with the 11p but can still be in the optimal 5500 to 6000 with the 12p, you could get a bit higher top end.  That was my experience when I was experimenting with a 13p and 12p prop a year or two ago.  Handy link about pitch and rpm  http://boatpropellers.iboats.com/propeller-tutorials/rpm/"
916705,cowanjo,2015-05-24 23:18:00,249,Mike just got the boat back yes 3 blde 12P - I actually have the 11 as well

915924,shimano19,2015-05-20 13:57:00,196,I recently bought a 08 mercury 60hp efi 4 stroke and took it out for the first time Sunday. At WOT it takes about 35-45 sec to plane and reaches a max speed of 21mph and 5100rpm. It's on a 16' smokercraft pro angler xl. Prop pitch is 13. Gas is from last season the owner said but stabil was put in the tank. My friend has the same boat and motor and he gets up on plane in 5 seconds and hits 37mph and 6000rpm. What could be the issue with mine?
915926,irishfield,2015-05-20 14:11:00,26272,"Just the rpm tells me you have too much prop on the boat. What prop is on your buddies... see if you can borrow it for a run. Old gas / new gas. Doubt this is your issue, unless you can noticeably see your engine is running rough, but good practice is to always top your tank in the spring with fresh (ethanol free) fuel to give the old stuff a boost."
915931,Bondar,2015-05-20 14:23:00,817,"My 50 hp 4 stroke merc will get my 16'8"" lund to 29-1/2 mph at about 5400 rpm and planes fairly quick. My boats about 150lbs lighter than yours. 6000 rpm seems a bit high for your buddys boat but I'm not positive. And your rpm is low. Have you done a compression test on the motor? Any pictures of the engine on the boat?"
915934,Sinker,2015-05-20 14:30:00,8692,"Yep, something isnt right there for sure.   My 40 pushes my 16ft starcraft 28-30mph depending on conditions.  S."

915940,DRIFTER_016,2015-05-20 14:44:00,10439,Way too much prop by the sounds of things. WOT on those Mercury 4 strokes should be between 5500-6000 RPM. Look @ the prop and let us know what the info on it is.  According to my guesstimation on the Merc prop selector these would be the best options for your boat. I would suggest one of the 4 blade aluminium spitfire props. Not expensive and great performance.  https://www.mercurymarine.com/en/ca/propellers/selector/#/step-one  
915942,shimano19,2015-05-20 15:05:00,196,"I already have a 13 pitch, I would need a smaller one"
915946,shimano19,2015-05-20 15:42:00,196,So with the different prop and higher Rpm is could get my speed up to 30+ mph like my friends
915948,Sinker,2015-05-20 16:08:00,8692,It should run +/- 30mph no problem.
915965,shimano19,2015-05-20 17:25:00,196,I've been getting different answers about prop and motor
915967,DRIFTER_016,2015-05-20 17:35:00,10439,"When I calculated your boat I used 1000# hull weight, 20 gallons of fuel, and 500#'s of people & supplies. You may need to adjust depending on your particular setup."
915970,BillM,2015-05-20 17:50:00,17367,Call up Kawartha Prop and ask one of the guys.

915987,irishfield,2015-05-20 18:46:00,26272,"Like I said earlier.. take the 5 minutes and borrow your buddies for a test run, if he lives close anyhow."
916003,shimano19,2015-05-20 19:26:00,196,His boats at a marina 3 hours from me so that's not an option and he's unsure of his prop specs
916041,craigdritchie,2015-05-20 22:07:00,1586,"Mercury says a 2008  60 hp four-stroke should run somewhere between 5,500 and 6,000 rpm at wide-open throttle.  If you're tapping out at just 5,100 rpm but the engine seems to run fine otherwise, you're most likely running too much prop. As a general rule, prop pitch alters engine rpm by about 200 rpm per inch. In your case, dropping two inches of prop, that is going from a 13-inch pitch to an 11-inch pitch, should give you another 400 rpm or so, and put you into the correct rpm range at WOT. Dropping one inch further, to a 10-inch prop, would theoretically put you around 5,700 rpm at WOT and likely give you optimal performance. On the Smokercraft, you should be in the 35 mph range running properly trimmed at full throttle.  Understand, these are averages and estimates - your mileage will vary somewhat.  Many on-water dealerships will allow you to try a prop before you buy it. Go find one, and try a smaller prop. The Mercury Spitfire four-blade comes in sizes from 9.5 to 23 inch pitch. As a four-blade prop, it won't be quite as fast wide open as a comparable three-blade, but it will get you up on plane much faster, and hold the boat on plane at lower speeds, even when it's heavily loaded. That's a fair trade-off for maybe 2 - 2.5 mph at the top end."
916089,shimano19,2015-05-21 10:38:00,196,"Awesome thanks for your help ^^ I will be picking up a 11 pitch today, the store told me if i want he'll switch it for even a 10 if I'm not satisfied, thanks!"
916092,DanD,2015-05-21 11:21:00,2223,"When you're trying out these props, don't forget to trim the boat out; it'll be different with each prop. My rule of thumb for a fully trimmed boat is, at wide open (on smooth water) keep bringing the bow up, until the boat starts to porpoise and then bring it down just enough for the porpoising to stop. I can usually squeeze out a couple hundred more rpm and 2-4 mph by doing so. You'll know you're getting close to the proper trim; you'll hear some of the load coming off the motor. I can't find the pic that a friend took, when we were running side by side. I was in my 16' tiller starcraft on plain and trimmed out; only the back 3' of the boat was still in the water, with the rest of the boat level to the horizon.  Dan."
916115,scugpg,2015-05-21 15:12:00,1373,If your hull weight is only 1000lbs and 13 pitch on a 60 I wonder if something else is going on with the engine. Hopefully the prop change fixes things up though but watch those rpms with the 10/11's.  That 60 isn't a Bigfoot is it with a different gear ratio?
916121,Garry2Rs,2015-05-21 15:42:00,1425,"Certainly total weight and hull design are factors, but most 16 foot boats with roughly 50 HP should be seeing about 30 mph carrying one or two men. I once had a glass 16 ft bow-rider that was a birch to get up on plain until I went down an inch on pitch.  One inch less gave me a much better hole shot, and didn't really hurt my top speed.  If you're only getting 5000 RPM. it might bring you up to 5800-6000 which would be just fine.  Some Marinas will let you test a new prop... Question...Where is the wake? It should be coming out in the area of the last 1/3 to 1/4 of the hull. If the motor is trimmed too low, you are pushing the bow into the water and loosing speed. For the fastest hole shot, trim the motor all the way down, putting the prop under the boat. As you come up on plain, start raising the motor.  You will hear your RPM's increase. At some point you will hear and feel the prop breaching, or you will start porpoising. Trim down and fiddle with it to find the sweet spot. The sweet spot will change depending on wind direction and water conditions.  "
916123,Stef,2015-05-21 15:45:00,63,"Check the height of the motor on the transom.  Many so called marinas just drop the motor onto the transom until it rests on the bracket and bolt it up.  Properly, the motor should be mounted so that the cavitation plate is at the bottom edge of the stern or so.  Most installs mean your bracket is not touching the edge of the motor well but sits 1-2 inches above.  If you can fit some fingers under there you're probably good to go, if not lift the motor and re-bolt in some of the other holes..."
916139,Walleye72,2015-05-21 16:35:00,156,"I am wading into a subject that I know very little about but I thought I would at least share my layout for comparison because I think it's similar to yours.  I have a Tracker Pro Guide 16 WT with a 2012 Mercury 60 HP 4-stroke.  My boat is a fairly stocky, heavy boat for it's length.  The max HP is 75.   With just me and my normal fishing gear, the boat get's up on plane fairly quickly, (under 10 secs I would think, although I have never timed it), and tops out at approx 30-31 mph at 5800-6000 RPM.  Trimming the motor is required to achieve that speed. With another full sized adult, (ie not my 40 lb daughter LOL), time to plane is noticeably longer, probably more like 15 seconds, but again I haven't timed it.   I am a new boat owner, and if I forget to trim the motor back down before taking off I notice substantial difficulty and immediately remember to adjust the trim back down. I had hoped the performance would be a little better with two + adults but for a first boat to learn on I'm pretty happy.  It would seem that your package is fairly similar to mine.  I'm surprised that your time to plane and top speed is so much different than mine given the similar boat style and motor size and prop pitch.  I'm wondering if there isn't something else going on to help explain it.  Trying the other props might yield useful information, but I would consider other factors as well.  Good Luck!  Bill"
916147,DRIFTER_016,2015-05-21 17:01:00,10439,I would still like to know what prop the OP has on his boat currently. Diameter and pitch.
