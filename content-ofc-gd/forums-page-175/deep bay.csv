915846,chris.brock,2015-05-19 23:13:00,4053,I can think of 4 places named Deep Bay. I'm guessing you're asking about the one on the road to Killbear?
915847,can u fish,2015-05-19 23:24:00,326,If you are referring to Deep Bay on Georgian Bay you can launch at Inverlochy Resort it is off of Hwy 559 the road to Kill Bear PP as Chris was saying.
