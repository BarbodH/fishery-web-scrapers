Sorry guys,having trouble getting them to enlarge.The top screw is line 1 and the lowest screw is marked line 2."
916619,ecmilley,2015-05-24 18:36:00,2163,Lopks like line 3. Lots of times going back to 115 vts it gets internally jumpes somwhere. Change lots of pumps  back and forth
916621,davey buoy,2015-05-24 18:44:00,5505,Going to add these two pictures again. 
916622,davey buoy,2015-05-24 18:46:00,5505,The other picture. 
916623,davey buoy,2015-05-24 18:48:00,5505,"On the terminal picture,that black e wire is on tab 4.I believe it says violet to be on 4?."
916637,G.mech,2015-05-24 19:24:00,830,"White goes on the top screw (L1), Black goes on the bottom screw (L2). Black connector goes on the tab on the L2 post, Violet goes on the post where black was (4).  (3) is left open.   Just did one of these yesterday at my neighbours....."

Change lots of pumps back and forth There is only a violet and smaller black wire marked with e.Just don't know where they would go as well as the main black and white coming in.I used to know this stuff ,getting older sucks lol."
916648,irishfield,2015-05-24 19:49:00,26272,Gmech just told you exactly how to do it Dave! Follow his advise before the magic smoke comes out !!!
916652,davey buoy,2015-05-24 19:57:00,5505,"Gmech just told you exactly how to do it Dave! Follow his advise before the magic smoke comes out !!! Did it that way and not even a hum.Triple checked everything,the connections are right as advised.Didn't even trip a breaker."

916665,davey buoy,2015-05-24 20:38:00,5505,"Now I put a actual plug on,working fine.Tried several times sticking the wires in the extension cord,but guess it wasn't  making a good enough contact. Thanks all,G mech and Wayne.Wealth of knowledge here I will say !!!!!!!"
916667,Terry,2015-05-24 20:38:00,14456,did you see it running on 220 never mind replied same time
916672,davey buoy,2015-05-24 21:06:00,5505,"Terry,the fellow had no clue,I thought the way it was it was wired for 220volt.I plugged it in for a second at his house and just hummed.Figured 220.Trying to figure out that drawing was a tad confusing.All looks good now."
