916237,icedude,2015-05-22 02:22:00,459,Paul you need to try more blight resistant strains..We switched to Sicilian saucers when they were the only survivors in our garden the one summer..Since then I harvest my seeds from them tomatoes. I haven't lost a plant to blight in 2 years now.  Where are you located? I wouldn't mind giving you a 6 pack of plants to try in your garden if you would like. Thanks for this-very kind of you--cell pack of 6 would be Terrific--am currently in Bradford--you could drop them off @ Joes Garden Center on the main drag and mark them Pickup for Paul  Cheers Mate  ID1
916464,crappieperchhunter,2015-05-23 14:47:00,2582,Some nice looking shots on here. Thx for sharing all. Got home from work last night at midnight and raced out to cover everything up. Good frost on the ground when I got up at 7. Went out to get my peppers tomatoes and basil plants in the ground. Tried to turn my hose on but it was froze solid enough that water would not come out  Came back in the house for a coffee to warm up a bit and the furnace is running. It is May 23rd isn't it.  Have had a veggie garden since I got my 1st house in 1984. I can't recall a frost this hard this late before here in Oshawa.
916465,manitoubass2,2015-05-23 14:51:00,11391,We just got 7 days of rain. Im thinking awesome!  Then i wake up and its snowing and everything is froze.  2 days later its in the 20's  Friggen weather  All the mint plants made it though?

There is risk of frost again in the long range for the week. They are expecting another polar down draft from the jet stream like the one that hit southern Ontario last Thursday.

We have a hobby *x8 greenhouse that i built from scrap patio doors. We raise 9 egg laying hens and keep Rabbits for meat.. Use all the rabbit manure to make organic compost tea..Everything goes full circle around here. What goes in our animals goes right back into the gardens.This year were growing Red, white and black currents, Strawberries, Rhubarb. Were also making our own tea this year for the second year in a row. We grow Tulsi (Holy Basil) tea Lemon bergmont and Chamomile teas. As for vegetables this year were doing the following.Sicilian saucer and heritage cherry tomatoes .Swiss chard, collards, 2 types of kale, broccoli, cabbage, green and yellow beans, Brussels Sprouts, zucchini and winter squash. All the stuff I mention above I started in the greenhouse..It sure is nice to be out there messing around in soil with a foot of ice and snow out there..

915893,bigugli,2015-05-20 03:28:00,6138,"  Before I retired I had done crop assessments and quality control. The focus of pest management in Ontario has been on the concept of integrated pest management where a greater reliance is put on more natural controls, but does not exclude chemical alternatives when things get out of hand. On the use of predatorial insects, there are so many to choose from depending on crops planted on your property and the neighbouring area. There are a number of braconid type wasps in use for soft skinned pests. Spider mites like Orius for controlling aphid and whitefly. Mantis and ladybug also have their place. While the predators are in play, other controls will hinder effectiveness.  We have also found that predators need to be introduced into our crops twice in a season.  I know that we get our predatory mites from Global, but I'm not sure where my buddy gets the  Braconids from. Unfortunately, a number of sources are wholesale agricultural suppliers. You might try a company called NIC in Stevensville. Also talk to the local co-op  On tomato blight, we have had some problems with some tomato varieties, as well as in late season. Spores are soil, water and air transmitted.  The cooler your nights, and the more overnight moisture, the greater your rate of spore germination. Last year was cool compared to others.  Our San marzanos and other Roma variants were hit hard with an 80% loss. Other plum varieties remained far more resilient. A soil drench prior to planting followed by another drench a few weeks after planting, with a fungicide is your best defence in slowing the blight. As a preventative, avoid evening watering like the plague. Bacterial and fungal spores need only 20 minutes of moisture contact and cool temps. to germinate. The longer the plant is wet, the worse it gets for your plants."

915910,Rod Caster,2015-05-20 11:24:00,5784,I cleared three 3/4acre fields with an excavator last fall and this year two of them will be plowed and the discs put to them. We have been spreading chicken and rabbit poop and compost on the clay since the winter. The field you see pictured will have 100 pumpkin seeds (1 giant seed from CBC) and the neighbors will use a plot for their potatoes and turnips.      The main garden has an awesome manure mix and will likely grow like it's nuclear-powered! We have seeds for: Tomatoes Peas Yellow and purple beans Kale Spinach Carrots Herbs ...and my wife likely has more.
