916300,123chadder,2015-05-22 14:23:00,165,"yes illegal,i think this is a case of ignorance.....still...."
916301,BillM,2015-05-22 14:23:00,17367,"Well it's better then a guy with a giant treble and a marshmellow  In all seriousness, the dog should be on a leash.  Stupid owner."
916303,dave524,2015-05-22 14:32:00,4508,The first reddish brown one looks very much like my dog
916307,PUMP KNOWS,2015-05-22 15:10:00,937,"This is why I don't bring my doberman to the river...  he would go nuts if he saw spawning salmon.  The last time I took him fishing for steelhead, he ate someones fish on the bank."

916351,PUMP KNOWS,2015-05-22 19:42:00,937,He ate about 6lbs worth of fish... 30mins later.. he puked it out.  Lucky it wasn't in the car
916363,tb4me,2015-05-22 20:37:00,3295,I dont see why not.. I would have stopped him after one fish though..Not sure if any laws were broken or not..
916364,NAW,2015-05-22 20:52:00,4022,I'm sure the dog was having the time of his/her life!!
916365,Canuck2fan,2015-05-22 20:54:00,1444,"Yeah that is ILLEGAL, not much better than letting your dog run deer out of season in my opinion."
916370,dave524,2015-05-22 21:04:00,4508,"Illegal?? seriously, that would mean if a cat catches any songbird the owner could be changed with hunting a protected species, My dog chases the squirrels in the backyard that turn around and chatter at her from the trees, better hope she don't get one. Guess if he encouraged the dog to get the fish and was keeping the rotting boots a CO. might have a case. Stupid , ignorant yes but illegal no."

LOL  I agree it couldn't be enforced for women and their cute murderous little felines, but I do believe it is illegal to willingly let any pet kill any wildlife, when you aren't in control of them on a legal hunt.  I use the example of ""letting"" your dog run deer out of season and unsupervised. The C.O. I took hunter safety from years ago, claimed to have shot dead many a farm dog that he found running deer on more than one occasion. If he saw the dog twice he didn't have to worry about seeing it three times. Never lost a court case brought against him over it either.... So that tells me, that maybe he had the LAW on his side? I could be wrong though."
916377,aplumma,2015-05-22 21:51:00,6896,Looks like he has a license. lol   Art
916408,Freshtrax,2015-05-23 01:26:00,2215,"Funny , my dog would be all over that....I think the brown dog is over his limit."
916409,manitoubass2,2015-05-23 01:42:00,11391,Dogs gone wild!  Hahaha could you imagine a CO approaching this guy?  My dog caught all the fish...  Here is your ticket sir.  No! Watch!  Baffled
916425,Gerritt,2015-05-23 02:41:00,6129,Might as well shoot all the Bears that do this season after season.... POACHERS!!!  I see no problem with this. Spent fish anyway.  G
916435,OhioFisherman,2015-05-23 04:50:00,6623,"LOL, those dogs have big eyes, I hope their appetites are as big! One of those fish looks like more than a meal to me! Do C/Os write tickets for bears?"
916439,Old Ironmaker,2015-05-23 07:28:00,8243,"The red could easily be charged as it was well over it's limit. There is a judicial system for animals it's ""Kangaroo Court.""  I can imagine the fish saying ""What the hell is this thing?"""
916806,SirCranksalot,2015-05-25 13:20:00,3291," I see no problem with this. Spent fish anyway.    How does he know the salmon are spent?  In any case it looks like the dog would be destroying, or at least disturbing, the redds. Get that do and it's stoopid owner out of there!!"
