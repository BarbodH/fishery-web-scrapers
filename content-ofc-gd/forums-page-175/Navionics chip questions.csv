905198,Fisherpete,2015-03-21 21:23:00,1814,I have an older Navionics chip - which is standard SD card size  Hotmaps Premium Canada SD/PREM-C4 VO1.19  My Lowrance units all take micro-SD cards - do I have any options for exchanging my older chip for a micro-SD version? Either through Navionics or a retail store? Or does anywhere accept trade in towards a new chip?  Can this chip be updated as well to reflect most current available map data?  Thanks Pete  
905287,mattaw,2015-03-22 02:44:00,162,"Pete,  I would just try calling Navionics USA and asking, they should be able to tell you what the standard protocol is, and maybe you can ask for a favor if it's outside of it. You never know if you don't ask!

905296,Freshtrax,2015-03-22 03:27:00,2215,Can you not just save all the files onto your computer.  Then put the micro in a blackberry ( or other phone)  Plug  it into your computer and save the files to the micro?
905460,Barneybass,2015-03-22 23:21:00,14,Navionics sells and update that is about $99. I don't think it's available for all order cards so it depends on how old the card is. If you have a USB sd card reader you can plug it into your computer and go to the Navionics site and see if can recognize your card. It will give you the options of upgrade if it's available. If not you'll need to get a new card.

916444,ColdH20guy,2015-05-23 10:35:00,312,do the navionics cards fit directly in the computer if you have an sd slot just to 'look around' at the different lakes without necessarily updating anything or do u need a special card reader? thanks

916448,ColdH20guy,2015-05-23 11:31:00,312,ok thanks
