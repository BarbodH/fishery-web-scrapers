916823,manitoubass2,2015-05-25 14:56:00,11391,Yeah ontario. Thats what I thought.  Way back when I originally posted those someone else broke it down for me on OFC and said they are NOT grizzlies.  I wish I remembered the convo but it was like 4 years ago or so
916824,BillM,2015-05-25 14:56:00,17367,"Yeah.  See that brown i put a picture of on the first page?  I thought those were brown bears for the longest time.   Well they are brown, I probably would have thought the same thing, lol!"
916825,manitoubass2,2015-05-25 14:57:00,11391,Lol bill  Doesnt it look like a grizzly though?
916829,Old Ironmaker,2015-05-25 15:16:00,8243,"Akrinsoner, how you describe you buddies experience is graphic. Better than those fake re enactments on TV. How did he survive that attach and did he loose his leg? Brutal. Happy to hear he survived and surprised too."
916830,Joey,2015-05-25 15:17:00,9122,"I've run into a few black bears in my Elliot Lake days when I was a kid.  They ran from me so most definitely, they are usually harmless.  They just wanted apples from the tree.  The townsite would just trap them in big bear traps and relocate them.  No need to kill any animal that is not a threat.  Cool pics Lew.  Probably is the same bear"
916832,lew,2015-05-25 15:22:00,12766,No need to kill any animal that is not a threat.    Too bad more folks don't think that way Joey.
916846,AKRISONER,2015-05-25 16:42:00,5558,"Akrinsoner, how you describe you buddies experience is graphic. Better than those fake re enactments on TV. How did he survive that attach and did he loose his leg? Brutal. Happy to hear he survived and surprised too.  As mentioned earlier the bear began eating his leg, he then gave it a hard enough time that it moved away for a bit, it then came back and started eating it again and then finally he was able to convince the bear that eating his leg while getting its eyes gouged wasnt worth it.  My understanding is that he was able to call for help and be rescued. He saved his leg, but im pretty sure its still pretty severely damaged.  My cousin made a point to take his boy to see him in the hospital and be aware of just how seriously hurt his ""uncle/godfather"" really was. He wanted to insure that his son had a respect for the wilderness and what can happen.  My cousin lives off the grid outside of Hinton Alberta. I went out and visited him last year and Grizzlies are no joke, you should see what they can do to a tree when sharpening their claws."
916847,manitoubass2,2015-05-25 16:47:00,11391,Lotsa guys in the grande prairie area that were surveyors quit and looked for jobs elswhere when they lost there right to carry guns  I used to see some huge bears too but I was always on work site or in a work truck
916851,lew,2015-05-25 16:55:00,12766,"AKRISONER, that's an incredible story and good to hear he survived the grizzly attack as many folks don't."
916853,manitoubass2,2015-05-25 17:05:00,11391,"Yes, surviving a grizzly attack is crazy.  Cant imagine the thought process of being eaten alive"
916870,James77,2015-05-25 19:45:00,175,"Colour is not an accurate way to identify a black bear from a grizzly. Body shape is. A grizzly has a pronounced hump on its shoulder, a build up of powerful muscles for digging. The grizzly has longer and straighter claws better for digging not so good for climbing although a smaller grizzly will climb a tree. The grizzly bear has a pronounced and longer nose and a dished face (older bear). Neither bears are particularly dangerous. The grizzly is more dangerous if surprised or has cubs and feels threatened. Grizzly attacks although rare are almost always self defense hence the reason many people are not killed during the attack. Black bear attacks are extremely rare. A black bear may attack in self defense, but more often the black bear has a means of escape such as running into the forest or climbing a tree."
916873,James77,2015-05-25 19:53:00,175,"I've been super interested in bears since I was younger, having never seen one in person it was always in the back of my mind that I might be mauled while fishing, or walking when up north. The media really make bears out to be way more intimidating than they should be. Black bears never kill humans out of defense for cubs, or for defense of food, when black bears kill it is normally an older male bear that is killing to eat. With most black bears when they charge it is just a warning sign, saying you're too close. The noisy charging bears normally never attack.  I'm not saying this woman is smart, this video could have gone the other way but it really opens your eyes."
916881,Beans,2015-05-25 21:32:00,3339,All I got out back today Lew is a big old jackrabbit...I've seen it a couple of times now but it disappears behind my shed before I can grab a camera...one of these days.....
916896,Beavertail,2015-05-25 23:04:00,331,"That's very cool too, not enough of those around anymore."
916938,cram,2015-05-26 01:42:00,1733,"That's a nice looking bear, Lew.   Must be a treat to have her nearby."
916632,lew,2015-05-24 19:15:00,12766,"Went out on the back deck a few minutes ago and found this big ole black bear in the yard.  He's in the shadows so is a bit hard to see.     I took a picture of this bear in the yard last summer and who knows, maybe it's the same one.    Bears aren't un-common around here and it's always nice when they show up."
916633,misfish,2015-05-24 19:18:00,29133,He just wants to know when dinner is.  Carefull out there Lew.
916636,manitoubass2,2015-05-24 19:24:00,11391,Nice!  I like when they show up too( even though the neighbours go nuts)  But yes be careful?
916642,lew,2015-05-24 19:37:00,12766,"Yup, always careful when their in the area.  We're down the end of a mile & a half dirt road and I go for a 2-3 mile hike most mornings before sunup and always make some noise while walking.  My wife and some girl friends in the day and always carry air horns with them just in case. does the same hike later"
916689,Old Ironmaker,2015-05-24 21:59:00,8243,"Man Rick, carry an air horn???? First off I wouldn't be going for any walks in the dark unless the path had street lights, if I did I sure wouldn't be carrying an air horn, it would be a 50 cal. minimum. Since we moved to what we call the ""country"" I won't take the garbage out after dark 40 feet from the door. You country folks are nuts.  edit, strike that, you are completely nuts!"
916690,Beavertail,2015-05-24 22:02:00,331,That IS a big boar!
916712,manitoubass2,2015-05-24 23:36:00,11391,"Meh, bears arent out to kill ya.  Frig in ear falls I could almost pet them(thats kinda pushing it lol)  Ive been charged once but totally my fault, i got between the momma and her cubs(without knowing at the time)  Live in NW ontario and bears are just normal appearances.  Thats a healthy bear lew  Here ya go OI, just sayin hello lol  "
916716,manitoubass2,2015-05-24 23:45:00,11391,  Same big girl plus a healthy black.
916720,Toronto_Angler,2015-05-24 23:59:00,698,Bears are as scare of us as we are of them. Just don't piss them off or there instinct kicks in. Nothing to be scared of from blacks though
916729,manitoubass2,2015-05-25 00:32:00,11391,Yeah blacks are purdy stable  Im not too sure about those browns yet lol
916757,Old Ironmaker,2015-05-25 01:42:00,8243,"Is there something in the water in the Artic watershed for G's sakes? I would rather deal with the Bloods or Crips or a couple of wiseguys in the club than a Bear .Charged by a Bear? What kind of dinner conversation is that? ""Oh honey a funny thing happened to me on the way home, I got between Mama Bear and Baby Bears and she charged at me."" How exactly does one get between Bear and her Cubs? I'm afraid to ask."
916759,Moosebunk,2015-05-25 01:52:00,3970,Don't trust 'em at all. Better it not be around than around Lew.
916772,OhioFisherman,2015-05-25 02:34:00,6623,""" He's in the shadows so is a bit hard to see. ""  LOL, he is not that hard to see! Had a deer in the yard myself this morning, that is a dangerous enough animal for me!"
916778,manitoubass2,2015-05-25 02:46:00,11391,"That was a gnarly experience. I was shore fishing with my kids.  Behind us was a hill and in front some tall grass.  I seen the bear early but it was a good 150 yards away or so. I just told the kids to keep an eye on it. Never did nothing for like an hour so i wasnt too worried.  Then the kids told me shes moving. So i sent them home on a route around the rapids and told them to tell mom to call 911 and get down there in the vehicle right away. I didnt have a cell phone back then lol.  Just as the kids left the bear came at me full tilt. Covered that 159 in no time flat. I had nothing but tackle lol and outta instinct i grabbed a fillet knife haha.  She stopped about 10ft away, stood up and pounded the ground. She did this for a few minutes then turned and walked into the long grass. Maybe it was seconds im not sure? But it sure felt long lol.  Took like 3 hours for my heart rate to return to normal hahahaha  But outta hundreds of encounters thats the only scary one"

916790,FloatnFly,2015-05-25 10:18:00,1640,"Bears are only dangerous in certain situations, get between mama and her cubs, walk up on them suddenly, or when they're feeding, other than that, they're pretty calm and serine,  They're beautiful creatures, just give em a little respect.  Just don't be like these citiots!  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgT1jEzPMDw"

My neighbor says we should all throw in some $$$$ and hire a hunter to kill all the bears in the area cause they ""may"" cause problems some day."
916808,manitoubass2,2015-05-25 13:33:00,11391,Wow Lew! Thats crazy talk.  Is there something back there they like to forage on? Or just taking a break while passing through?
916811,lew,2015-05-25 14:02:00,12766,Nothing out of the ordinary for them to eat Rick but they get spotted quite often.  This is a mom & 4 cubs up a tree just 150' from the end of my driveway a couple years back.    Nobody around here has ever heard of a bad incident between them and people though and some folks have been here 50 odd years.  I think this is the 4th I've seen in my yard.
916814,AKRISONER,2015-05-25 14:19:00,5558,"black bears are usually totally ok, however brown bears....you are quiet simply food to them.  My cousins best friend was mauled by a brown in Alberta, the thing clamped onto his head and then started eating his leg. it then left for a bit and left buddy dying, he then came back and started eating his leg some more, the guy finally convinced the bear that he wasnt worth the tasty meal after gouging its eyes enough.  He then was rescued and survived but was in intensive care for months. They are no friggin joke."
916816,dave524,2015-05-25 14:37:00,4508,"I thought that in Ontario anyway black and brown bears were just different colour phases of the same species, just like black and grey squirrels, red phase and grey phase of Ruffed Grouse and Screech Owls. The Brown bears on the West Coast are an entirely different species. Don't think the colour of the fur could cause any behavioural differences."
916817,manitoubass2,2015-05-25 14:43:00,11391,"I think your right dave.  I used to think they were totally grizzlies around here and I remember on here a much more knowledgable fella broke it down for me.  I dont think they are totally the same, you can see a structural difference in the head and the ones ive seen are def. Bigger then the blacks.  Never seen one aggresive though."
916821,lew,2015-05-25 14:53:00,12766," I used to think they were totally grizzlies around here  You talking about Ontario Rick ??  I always understood Grizzlies were Alberta, BC & Alaska"
916822,manitoubass2,2015-05-25 14:54:00,11391,Yeah.  See that brown i put a picture of on the first page?  I thought those were brown bears for the longest time.
