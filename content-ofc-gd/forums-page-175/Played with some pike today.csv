915394,kickingfrog,2015-05-15 23:33:00,8333,Nothing fancy just 2 guys in a boat fishing.  My brother had one in the boat before I had even decided what lure to use.    Most of them today were that size unfortunately.  Only in focus photo of me with a fish today.    Big fish of the day casting a suspending husky jerk. 36-37 inches  
915396,spincast,2015-05-15 23:39:00,3279,I'd take that over my day in the office - any time. Good start to the long weekend.
915401,manitoubass2,2015-05-16 00:12:00,11391,Nice!!!!  Looks like a great day and that one fish is a fatty?
915403,Rizzo,2015-05-16 01:05:00,4754,sheesh. All these reports and I haven't got out once yet. That second one is a beaut!
915420,kickingfrog,2015-05-16 12:25:00,8333,My brother got a few on zaras and I got some on a syclops both in fire tiger. Husky jerks in natural colours produced the rest including a real beauty that was lost at the boat that might haunt us both all season. That's fishin'.
915421,lew,2015-05-16 12:31:00,12766,Always enjoy your stories with you & your brother Rob.  My brother and I fished together all the time and if he was still with us him and I would have left yesterday for our annual trek to Quinte for spring time eyes.  I miss those trips alot but reading your tales always brings back many great memories.
915451,Pickeral eater,2015-05-16 20:32:00,155,"Nice fish dude, boats been in for over a week and yet to get out!  Your bro's looks chunky!"
915461,misfish,2015-05-16 22:36:00,29133,Do I see you wearing SPAM?  Nice as always Rob.
915465,kickingfrog,2015-05-16 23:05:00,8333,Do I see you wearing SPAM?  Nice as always Rob. Nope. I'd either had to have got it for free and/or received payment it lieu of.
915482,BillM,2015-05-17 02:40:00,17367,"Nice job Rob, any weed growth out there yet?"
915535,kickingfrog,2015-05-17 23:43:00,8333,There was. More than I remember from last year at the same time.
915605,BillM,2015-05-18 16:38:00,17367,"Yeah last year was pitiful for early season weed growth.   I'll be out there this week with the oldman (I like to avoid weekend boat traffic, lol)"
915628,MJL,2015-05-18 17:41:00,2427,The last one is a fatty!  Nicely done
915656,fishindevil,2015-05-18 19:23:00,6254,Well done guys !!! Great day on the water for sure ...nice color on that pike too.
