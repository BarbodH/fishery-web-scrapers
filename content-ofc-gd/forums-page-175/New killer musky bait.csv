My brother grabbed the wrong crankbait box and only had deep diving bass cranks. Instead of using one of mine he put this on and caught a 40ish inch musky within 5 minutes. My money was on a drum or channel cat before it came to the surface.  Only had a few hours and it was a foul wind.

916538,kickingfrog,2015-05-24 01:49:00,8333,Ya I wouldn't know the difference. Shoulda' got a photo.
916541,manitoubass2,2015-05-24 01:51:00,11391,Lol
916721,Grimace,2015-05-25 00:02:00,2020,I think he is referring to the musky in the water.  He would not take an OOS picture.  The other picture is a different fish.. A pike.
916730,manitoubass2,2015-05-25 00:33:00,11391,Twas a joke.  His intent was clear?
