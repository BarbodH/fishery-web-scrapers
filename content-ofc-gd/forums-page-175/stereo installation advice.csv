915883,callatis,2015-05-20 02:16:00,5,"Hi,  I am looking for advice on how to install a marine stereo (AM/FM, SD card digital player) and two speakers on my Legend Xtreme. I don't want to install the stereo inside the glove compartment and I am hesitating of drilling 6 1/2'"" speaker holes.  Thanks a lot!  "
915894,BillM,2015-05-20 03:40:00,17367,"You should be able to get an installation kit for the console.  as for the speakers, put them in each footwell."
915929,lookinforwalleye,2015-05-20 14:17:00,4399,Bluetooth speaker + Bluetooth streaming device = no muss and no fuss and certainly no holes!!!
915932,BillM,2015-05-20 14:26:00,17367,Bluetooth speaker + Bluetooth streaming device = no muss and no fuss and certainly no holes!!!  Doesn't work very well if you want to listen to the radio
915935,AKRISONER,2015-05-20 14:34:00,5558,"if you dont want to drill holes, a couple of small boxes for the speakers and install them that way."
915941,MrSimon,2015-05-20 14:58:00,217,"There are lots of marine grade, fully enclosed speakers out there that you could use.  Some are even wireless.      "
915955,lookinforwalleye,2015-05-20 16:48:00,4399,Listen to the radio...that one should not be very hard to figure out..
915963,BillM,2015-05-20 17:23:00,17367,Listen to the radio...that one should not be very hard to figure out..  Didn't you just tell him to install a bluetooth speaker and a streaming device?  Where does the radio fit in?
915973,Raf,2015-05-20 18:08:00,3495,"bill, they have radio on the internets now."
915989,dave524,2015-05-20 18:55:00,4508,"My cheapo phone has FM radio and quite a few gigs of music, I can stream it to my Bluetooth hearing aids , I would assume you could do the same with a Bluetooth speaker in a boat."
915992,BillM,2015-05-20 19:01:00,17367,"bill, they have radio on the internets now.  That's going to work great with no cell coverage"
915994,Raf,2015-05-20 19:04:00,3495,"Fair enough Bill -- for the 5% of cases.. most people I think, fish well within cell/wifi/fm antenna range.  if you're out of cell range, you're propably out of range of any radio stations too.  I stream media on my phone when out & about from my media server at home LOL.  If I really wanted to, the same media server could serve up fm/am."
915996,BillM,2015-05-20 19:10:00,17367,This thread reminds me that I never use the radio in the boat
916011,DRIFTER_016,2015-05-20 19:52:00,10439," Doesn't work very well if you want to listen to the radio  It does if you pair it with your phone and stream from your favorite stations web site. Actually works better than a radio. I stream CFNY 102 here and I know my radio can't pick it up from 5,500kms away!!"
916063,dave524,2015-05-20 23:54:00,4508,"  I stream CFNY 102 here and I know my radio can't pick it up from 5,500kms away!!  Haven't listened to CFNY since Dave Marsden left, the format changed and the "" Spirit of Radio "" died. CHUM FM was actually great station back in the early 70's too. Thank god  for internet stations no good OTA stations anymore.  Remember Pete and Geets"

Been listening since they started broadcasting out of the old farm house in Brampton. I used to work a Friday night show @ RPM with Chris Sheppard, The Live Earl Jive and Beverly Hills back in the day too.  Yes, it certainly isn't what it was but at least Allan Cross is still around."
916077,lookinforwalleye,2015-05-21 01:55:00,4399,Like I said trying to figure out how to listen to a radio signal is not difficult...however I am with Bill no radio on in my boat!!!
916560,callatis,2015-05-24 11:35:00,5,"Thanks everyone! BassPro offer on stand alone speakers is very limited, only one bulky model.    I got some gift cards from BassPro for my B-day and I wanted to get something there. The US web site says $299 for stereo installation. Did anyone use their services?  I just saw this YouTube review and building two MDF speakers boxes and attaching them under the port ans starboard consoles might be an idea. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t_E3yukEkc  Too bad I cannot find these ones. Maybe online order.  "
