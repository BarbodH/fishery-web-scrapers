916866,Gallie,2015-05-25 18:53:00,1215,Thanks for the kind words fellas! If bunk is jealous then i must be doing something right?
915563,Gallie,2015-05-18 11:22:00,1215,"I just got back from my annual pike fishing trip and it went well, the fishing was definitely slow at times especially early mostly due to a cold front early in the week. Everyone managed a nice sized fish but the way it happened for us was kinda strange. We had entered a bay on day 4 with the only decent fish so far being the skinny one i had gotten on day 2 and the middle man in the boat hooks a monster, he protests that its just a baby but watching as it hugs bottom on the way in we know better. We slide the cradle under after a brief fight and its our first truly nice fish of the trip. . She was a little worse for wear on her tail and dorsal fins but a pretty fish nonetheless, she was quickly released and we continued fishing.  Not 5 casts later the bow man appears to get snagged near the shore so he starts dragging the boat towards the ""snag"" about 30 seconds in however it takes off to his right and the fight is on. This fish had a couple good runs in her but was also in the cradle in good time.   So after releasing this long beauty we head to the top of the bay on the opposite side to start a new drift, we had all been a little down due to the rough start we had but had completely turned around and were through the roof with excitement after these two fish back to back, well dont i fire my first cast of the drift off shore and hook into something that feels pretty heavy, could we catch our 3 biggest fish in a 15 min time frame back to back to back? The odds seem astronomical after 3 3/4 days with only 1 nice fish to show. After a nice fight and an unfortunate struggle in the cradle causing me a sliced thumb and the fish a good couple hook marks we had fish number 3.   At 39 1/2 in it was a touch shorter than the one i caught early but she was a bruiser where it counted.  This trip definitely made us work for it but our perseverance paid off allowing us something to think about until next years foray into the bush, Thanks for reading here are a couple more pics.  My entry fish at just a hair over 40""    Its amazing how much smaller it looks than the bruiser with her sleek build.   Silly whitefish, spoons are for pike    Always nice to get a nice mid range fish    Another little piggy    1 more for the road.  Until next year... Tightlines fellas."
