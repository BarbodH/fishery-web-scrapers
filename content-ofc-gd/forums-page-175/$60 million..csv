916327,NANUK,2015-05-22 17:29:00,797,"Lot of Lures, yes I don't know about a Ranger, ?"
916329,manitoubass2,2015-05-22 17:35:00,11391,"60 mill and ill have 2 beauty houses, one on rainy lake and one on LOTWs  A few vehicles, a couple nice boats, quads and atvs, alot of good food and the rest can sit in the bank till i decide i wanna ocean fish with the fam."
916335,crappieperchhunter,2015-05-22 18:00:00,2582,Take a Zero off that and it's still more then I'll ever need. Can't even imagine that kind of money. Nobody in my immediate family would ever have to work again with the full 60 million though.

916346,adempsey,2015-05-22 19:12:00,1498,An  El Gordo style lottery would be interesting.
916347,NAW,2015-05-22 19:13:00,4022,"Well.  I would by very expensive, powerful car, then go blow doughnuts in the front parking lot of my work."

916352,captpierre,2015-05-22 19:51:00,2521,Why don't they pay athletes and coaches based on performance?
916355,Big Cliff,2015-05-22 19:56:00,6899,"Same reason they don't pay politicians based on preformance, they couldn't live on it!"
916371,Canuck2fan,2015-05-22 21:05:00,1444,60 Million could do a lot good and a fair bit of damage too LOL.
916375,Fisherman,2015-05-22 21:23:00,7201,"I wish they would give out 240 prizes of $250,000 each. That would change a lot of lives. Exactly, a lot of the million winners just blow it and don't set themselves up right."
916376,Beavertail,2015-05-22 21:36:00,331,Chevette power! I love it! too funny. You could buy a few of them for 60M.
