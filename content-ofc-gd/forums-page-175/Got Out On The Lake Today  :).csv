Two hours of trolling was all I could handle. I strained a tendon in my left elbow back when I was hauling wood to the cabin and it is pretty sore now.  Gettin' old sucks!!!!  There is a mile or so of open water right now but last weekend there was barely any at all. I was surprised how much disappeared in less than a week.      Time to get the boat ready and out on the lake for a run next weekend.
