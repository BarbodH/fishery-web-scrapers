916527,Cosmos,2015-05-24 00:32:00,588,"6-12 fow, moon eye jig with 3 inch gulp minnow caught all fish today."
916542,Big Cliff,2015-05-24 02:16:00,6899,"Talked to a couple of guys fishing the tournament on Sturgeon today about noon, at that point they only had 2 and they were small."
916567,Garfisher,2015-05-24 12:26:00,229,"Day 1 leader had 11.18lbs (only team who weighed in over 10lbs if I remember correctly), 10th had 5.67lbs"
916570,Big Cliff,2015-05-24 12:41:00,6899,"Same two guys I talked to yesterday were back again this morning, they had already caught two nice size fish and said they were in the money. A lot of boats in the Goose Bay area this morning, not seeing a lot of fish being caught though."
916627,shimano19,2015-05-24 18:59:00,196,Went out today got 8 between the two of us. Most fish caught in the early morning then one here or there throught the day
916855,msp,2015-05-25 17:21:00,1336,The bite was amazing on Friday. 20km north winds. Boated 17 in 5 hrs. Bucktails and jerkbaits
916858,Pickeral eater,2015-05-25 17:42:00,155, Was there yesterday and managed 8.  One keeper everything else too big which was nice to see.  Good chop out there.  Half came with jig/worm and half came on the troll.
915521,captpierre,2015-05-17 21:07:00,2521,Unfortunately I have to work this weekend. But what's everybody's experience been so far with this springs walleye bite? I got a 22 incher trolling a Clown Husky Jerk  and a 15 jigging a buck tail last weekend. That's it.
915526,tbayboy,2015-05-17 21:56:00,1497,Was out on Rice from 8-1 Saturday with nothing but a couple out of season bass and some pesky perch.  Didnt see a lot of catching going on but I only hit a couple spots so certainly not the whole story (though those spots have never failed in May before).
915527,Garnet,2015-05-17 22:13:00,2056,Rice is just being Rice.  Wicked mayfly hatch today. Started at 10 my trolling motor quit at noon. Got a doz.
915545,206,2015-05-18 02:32:00,563,"opener on rice i only managed 2 16"" eye both on a crank. I hope to get out tuesday this week."
915548,gino,2015-05-18 03:00:00,400,"got 4 on saturday, and lots of perch"
915560,fishindevil,2015-05-18 08:20:00,6254,Did the Kawartha lakes opener last weekend and did great for eyes !!! Also did the Haliburton opener for eyes too this weekend and did well too  lots of big walleyes over the slot last weekend and all had to go back  it's been a workout trying to get a few in the slot for a meal !!!!  I am looking forward to a few days holidays I have Comming up in a week or so and can get out during the week and should be even better fishing as it won't be a weekend on the kawarthas and most if the gong show will have gone home .....
915645,Sinker,2015-05-18 18:25:00,8692,"Got 11 saturday, and 9 today. Just a few hours on the water, mid day to boot. Its been pretty darn good so far!  S."
915848,chris.brock,2015-05-19 23:33:00,4053,"What was the surface temp if you guys remember?  I was out Thursday, mid day, cool, clear day, and couldn't find them. Just pike and bass. Water was 58 to 60 degrees and frost overnight the night before."
915852,Acountdeleted,2015-05-19 23:54:00,2562,Got 2 on Saturday despite the mayfly hatch. Sunday morning was nada.
915855,Sinker,2015-05-20 00:00:00,8692,"We got 6 in the slot today, a lot of under slots, and 2 over. It was tougher in the wind today. Fish were there, but boat control was a lot of work.  Water temp was 65ish  S."
915986,esoxansteel,2015-05-20 18:45:00,1307,"fished Monday landed 9 and 4 of those fish were on a gammie stinger hook tied to the back of the bucktail, via 30 pound power pro, all fish were caught on hair, on both 1/8ths and 1/4s, that was my maiden voyage, as I fish steelhead up to that point, but am off next week   water temp was 64.7 when I put in, and 66.2 when I pulled out. most of the fish were upper end in the slot skinnies, 18 to 19 inch fish, with 2 under, and 2 over"
916059,Garnet,2015-05-20 23:27:00,2056,Sturgeon has been giving me a butt whooping.
916197,Big Cliff,2015-05-21 23:24:00,6899,"Sturgeon has been giving me a butt whooping. You aren't alone, I have talked to quite a few locals that tell me the bite on Sturgeon this year is MUCH slower than normal. Most of them feel that the super low water levels have really played havic with the walley and I have had a few tell me the crappie bite was very different and in some cases they just weren't where they would usually be, again because of water levels."
916203,Sinker,2015-05-21 23:47:00,8692,"I havent tried sturg for walleyes yet, but the crappie fishin sucked this year for me!  Crappie fishing in general was not good at all for me.  The walleyes have been good so far though, I cant complain.  S."
916214,porkpie,2015-05-22 00:36:00,2521,"You aren't alone, I have talked to quite a few locals that tell me the bite on Sturgeon this year is MUCH slower than normal.

Same deal on buckhorn.  Crappie weren't where they usually are in any numbers, and the pickerel we really had to work for.  The last 2 years have been fantastic.  I think the low water levels just upset the apple cart a bit.  Thats fishing!"
916224,ecmilley,2015-05-22 01:24:00,2163,goofy weather patterns have the most effect imo some tactic changes for walleyes were in order but the fish are there lack of weeds and cold water makes it tough but doable. crappies were where i looked for em and there still on the beds as of sunday
916276,shimano19,2015-05-22 11:29:00,196,"Went to rice last sun, got 4. May fly hatch was on and bluebird skies no wind made it tough. Bucktails and cranks. Anyone else get any recently on rice?"
916304,jimmer,2015-05-22 14:37:00,2730,"I have found it tough after the opening day. Water is low, cleared up in most spots and very little weed to target cover. Went out last night and caught one in the slot, 3 under and some massive perch for Pigeon Lake. I do think the constant pounding of the usual crappie spots is having an effect on the success this year. This is my opinion, but how many fish can be taken before you see a decline. Sounds like most people want that to happen anyway."
916319,aznphil,2015-05-22 16:32:00,73,"they should put a +12"" slot for craps, being cold water fish they dont grow as fast as people think they do...  but ya tough last weekend on rice for eyes saw the bug hatch, crappies however have been consistent and yes not in the ""usual"" spots"
916321,Acountdeleted,2015-05-22 16:39:00,2562,Tried Scugog last weekend. What a disaster. You can really see the effect the fishing pressure has had on it. Not a single fish.
916368,Sinker,2015-05-22 21:02:00,8692,"Carp are going like crazy, you have that bow yet? Could of nailed them last weekend!!  S."
916392,Acountdeleted,2015-05-22 22:59:00,2562,I must not know where to find em. We didn't see any.
916431,Sinker,2015-05-23 02:59:00,8692,I do. Lets get 'em! I would LOVE to try it!  S.
916440,Old Ironmaker,2015-05-23 09:38:00,8243,"Finally got the "" Bassassin"" in the water after doing a slew of PM and a new steering cable on it for the last 2 weeks. We tried for the elusive Grand River Eyes below the Dunnville Dam to Pt. Maitland. After trolling a selection of hardware, bottom bouncing Lindy Rigs and drift jigging plastic for a few hours we were rewarded with a 12"" young Pic. Trolled a few different body baits out onto the lake and found some fish on the Humminbird but no takers. They may have been a scattering of Perch or some very tired post spawn female Smallies. Not many folks were out either the river or the lake but it will be a Zoo this morning I would guess. I'll tell you all something, what a beautiful and fantastic afternoon and early evening it was. Everything on the boat worked, I can steer with one finger almost with the new rack and pinion set up and I got some colour on my pasty olive hue skin. Some fish may have been nice but fish or no fish we are blessed just to be able to get out on the water. Some of my fishing buddies can't even get in and out of a boat any longer. Some because the bodies are done for and a few because they passed over the winter and they are no longer are with us. So I count my blessings."
916488,Cosmos,2015-05-23 18:32:00,588,Spent this morning on Rice. Bite was really good in the early morning. Got 7 and lost 2. Biggest was 19 inches.  Wind pushed me away at 10 am.
