916333,manitoubass2,2015-05-22 17:44:00,11391,But americans might not have stop signs!  Ever been to internatuonal falls mn?  Half the intersections have no stop signs at all. How safe is that?  When I was about 15 a friend and I watched a young boy bike through one of the intersections and was met by a full speed delivery truck.  Not cool at all and forever burned into my memory.
915901,spincast,2015-05-20 10:16:00,3279,"Just a public service notice - the attached article gives details on an airbag recall affecting almost 34 million cars. In the article is a link to the manufacturer's website for both CDN and US registered vehicles. The logistics and costs of this recall are mind boggling. I suspect it is going to take years to complete, and I can't help but wonder if Takata will be able to support that level of replacement requirements from either an operational or financial position. If I had one of the vehicles affected by this, I would be getting my spot in line as soon as possible. Don't wait for the recall card in the mail  article: http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/takata-now-has-biggest-recall-in-history-33-8-million-vehicles-1.3079490  CDN link:http://www.tc.gc.ca/eng/motorvehiclesafety/safevehicles-defectinvestigations-1412.html  US Link: http://www.safercar.gov/rs/takata/index.html"
915908,Fish Farmer,2015-05-20 11:13:00,2234,Thanks for the heads up. Just to get them deactivated would be good till there is a replacement. You would think all news channels would procast this. Makes me think about those 2 kids that got killed on the Red Hill Creek Expressway last week???
915914,DanD,2015-05-20 12:14:00,2223,"Just to get them deactivated would be good till there is a replacement. You would think all news channels would procast this.   That's what I'd do, if I owned one of these cars equipped with that airbag. But can you imagine the consequences of someone being injured or killed because the airbags were purposely disabled. I wouldn't want to be the person who made that decision to have 34 million vehicle's air bags disabled. When GM was in the middle of their ignition switch fiasco and the replacement parts were not available after the announcement of the recall. All the owner of one of the affected vehicles had to say; I feel unsafe and I want a rental, until it is repaired. My wife is a service advisor at a GM dealership, they had so many cars on the lot; that they had to start parking them at the rental agency where they were getting the replacement car for their customers.  Dan."
915968,DRIFTER_016,2015-05-20 17:37:00,10439,"Yep, mine is on the list of recalled vehicles in the US. Doesn't show up on the Canadian recall list though. Going to have to call them up."

915982,G.mech,2015-05-20 18:36:00,830,I think I'd rather have a potentially defective air bag rather than no airbag any day.....there have been no reported issues in Canada so I think the risk is pretty low.
916032,spincast,2015-05-20 21:28:00,3279,"I think I'd rather have a potentially defective air bag rather than no airbag any day.....there have been no reported issues in Canada so I think the risk is pretty low. The risk,based on the currently available information may appear low, but consider a) statistics - significantly lower number of vehicles on the CDN roadways than the US, so it only makes sense that not only would the defect be discovered and identified in the US first, but the number of instances would be significantly higher; and  this wasn't really identified as a situation to look for in accidents in Canada till now, so who knows how often it has happened and the facial lacerations were put down to other factors? Then consider that the pressure from an exploding airbag that is not over charged will, by design have enough force to  break a wrist if the hands are at the top of the wheel when they explode. These ones are exploding with such force they are splintering the metal container that holds them and turning it into shrapnel. Also, consider that an airbag will deploy at slow speed as well as high. So you driving to the store and have a fender bender at 40, and the passenger bag goes off and sends shrapnel into your passenger,blinding them or worse. Who is that most frequently in your car? The car company / takata are paying for the repairs IMO  - let e'm and the sooner the better"
916035,manitoubass2,2015-05-20 21:42:00,11391,"34 million recalls?  This day and age this should never, ever happen with such sophisticated testing.  I smell a bailout or some sort of tax manipulation.  No way does any company willingly overlook this without a very demented outlook."

Over- regulation and a global economy.  I've got a crappy, wannabe truck and a baby in a car seat and I can't disable the airbags. I didn't have the option for the airbags in the first place."
