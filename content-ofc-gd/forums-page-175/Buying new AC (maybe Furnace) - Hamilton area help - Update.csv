914263,chris.brock,2015-05-08 04:06:00,4053,"Exactly. Package deal, the guys do it in one trip and one day.  Don't expect to save a lot on energy costs. My furnace was 30 plus years old and the new one only gives me a little savings.  Sears did all the paper work and I got my gov't rebates."
914413,xxgoaler,2015-05-09 19:31:00,106,Bigger savings when you get d/c motors in your furnace ( inducer and blower ) and gas savings on a 2 stage gas valve .  Motors are much more expensive to replace when they fail though.
914475,Steve,2015-05-10 13:57:00,2075,"well, I met two fella's that are family of one of my best friends (his stag and doe was this weekend).  they are coming over on Monday to give me an assessment.  thanks for all the assistance. I'll let you know what I decide to go with."
915100,Steve,2015-05-13 23:31:00,2075,"So I've had two companies by the house so far, and will have the ""friends"" of my best friends family come by last.  The first company showed up late, was rather rude, and too pushy on the sale. They were $7,700 for furnace and a/c, 10 year parts and 5 years labour. Then 650 energy return. (so they say, I have to send it in).  The second company just left. This company spent a lot longer with me, gave me a much more professional quote, $4K for A/C on its own, GSX16 Goodman. Or, $8,478, less $650, which these guys guarantee, and they send in your information. If you don't receive return in 6 months they will pay you the $650 (and they put that in writing). The furnace is a GMVC86 Goodman. This package is 10 years parts and labour guarantee.  Friday the two ""dudes"" come by. These guys installed full furnaces and AC's at four of my friends places all without issue....and I've heard they are cheaper.....but.....  Leaving the ""dudes"" aside, how does that second quote sound?  I expected a bigger savings by doing the furnace at the same time. The second quote is $4K for a/c, but another $4.4K to add furnace...shouldn't that furnace charge be less?  Makes me think about just doing the a/c and waiting on the furnace. but then again ....."
915102,John Bacon,2015-05-13 23:43:00,3277,Someone mentioned a few posts back to stay away from Goodman.
915103,Big Cliff,2015-05-13 23:50:00,6899,Both those quotes sound high to me!
915104,G.mech,2015-05-14 00:11:00,830,"Both those quotes sound high to me! x2...those prices are pretty bad especially for the Goodman stuff.  I had mine replaced in a panic two years ago (I was out of town and had to get the local a/c guy to do it while I was gone to keep the wife happy).  He put in a 2 ton Goodman condensing unit, new A-coil, new 50 foot lineset, all for $2500.  I put a new 1.5 ton Payne condensing unit, coil, & lineset in my mom's house last year for her and the total parts were under $1200, labour was about 8 hours.  The high efficiency furnaces list for about $2000 (installers get 50% off list).  You can't buy the parts yourself at too many places and even if you can, most guys won't install or service it.   I really hate these guys and they all seem to be cahoots.  As mentioned, the Goodman stuff is okay but it really isn't up the York, Carrier, Payne standards by any stretch. I am very  lucky to have a good friend in the business so we can get parts and he's got the license and tools needed.  I think all you can do is keep shopping around and see if you can find an honest Residential HVAC contractor (aka Unicorn).  Good luck and my heart bleeds for you....sometimes the 'dudes' are far more honest and reliable than the name brands, hopefully it works out."
915118,livinisfishin,2015-05-14 01:26:00,661,You havent really mentioned what the actual install would be like. Are the quotes possibly high because of what the job entails and materials needed?  Edited because i reread and saw the model and rebates.
915121,leaf4,2015-05-14 01:52:00,2466,"Those prices are high wow. the actual price on the ac and furnace would be under $2000 as a business buying it, I just installed a horizontally mounted furnace plus coil and condenser the cost on it was $1700"
915286,mikemcmillan,2015-05-15 03:00:00,50,"We have been installing Goodman for a few years with no problems. Are your prices taxes in? I would think we could do this for $6000.00 all in maybe less but would have to see it to be exact. We do 6 or 8 a year just to pay for our atv & snowmobile trips. Yes it's a sideline, guy I work with with is a licensed industrial electrician with his gas license. we have been doing this for 6 or 7 years. Just putting it out there, if your interested. And yes we have all heard the stories of using a friend of a friend or guy who works on the side but we have all been burned some way or another. thanks Mike"
915297,wormdunker,2015-05-15 08:13:00,1711,I had Aplus air from Hamilton install a new Carrier furnace & 15 seer AC unit 5 years ago.  10 year parts & labour warranty on everything.  They also installed a new flow through humidifier & cartridge type air filter.  They advised me to get the variable speed DC fan motor.  My fan runs 24/7 on low speed - keeps the humidifier operating & the air filter is filtering the air continuously.  My electric bill is very reasonable - less than 80 bux per month.  I like the fact my inside air is being constantly filtered.
915308,Steve,2015-05-15 11:14:00,2075,"KW, those prices are taxes in.  They also include upcoming my fluce (sp) on my hot water heater to code.  I have another company company coming tonight for a quote.  Freaking HVAC scams."
915390,mikemcmillan,2015-05-15 22:45:00,50,"Steve, you are right about hvac scams, but is there any industry that doesn't have people like that. Car repairs, home reno's, take your boat in and see what happens, lots of places do great work and some not so much.  Just like Lucas said about Goodman, he's not a fan but we haven't had any problems with them so who knows. There are many good brands out there with problems but the trick is to try and find someone who will stand behind there product.  Yes the price might be a little high but you have to think what goes into it running a business like this, lots of expenses when you have trucks, sales people, a shop, advertising, insurance and the liability that goes along with it. No that doesn't make it right that they are pricey but there is a reason and that's to make a profit.  I personally think that price is very high but have not had a close up look at the job so it's pretty easy to criticize from the computer. Sounds like they are going to put in a chimney liner so the water heater is safe and that's important.  From my perspective your furnace, a/c unit & condenser, programmable thermostat, lines and materials to install will be under 3 grand or there abouts, so anything over is labor. Again this is from my desk in front of my computer so take it as just my 2 cents. Good luck in your search. Mike"
915400,NANUK,2015-05-16 00:10:00,797,"Steve, I don't have any body I can recommend in your area, I am a licensed HVAC mechanic (commercial) with 35 years in this trade, I don't do residential, sorry. I am not well versed on makes of residential HVAC equipment but I work and talk to people who install/repair residential A/C & furnace on daily bases, one thing I can tell you, it is very important that installation should be done by a licensed HVAC mechanic with good experience and reputation, equipment's make, model, warranty does not mean much if the equipment was not installed properly, A good mechanic will have good workmanship, piping practices like brazing and evacuating the lines (very important), equally important is a well maintained vacuum pump. contamination in the system is one of a major cause of premature equipment failure,  proper electrical and thermostat hookup, proper sheet metal work right down to running the condensate drain, A simple example is roofing, A 25 year shingle warranty means squat if the roof is not done right. The reason it feels like a scam because there are too many fly by night ""artists"" installing A.C and furnaces. no different than any other trade. There is a reason you have to go through 5 years of apprenticeship to get your ticket. A higher price doesn't always reflect higher quality of work, BUT at the same time, ""GOOD"" and ""CHEAP"" shouldn't be used in a same sentence when it comes to tradesmen, a good tradesman deserves to make a decent living. I wouldn't install Goodman in my house. Trane and Keeprite are also not what they used to be, lots of bad reviews, If you have any other questions, I can answer via PM,"
915408,Steve,2015-05-16 02:08:00,2075,"thank you gentleman.  I have Cosmopolitan Mechanical Services coming by Sunday evening for a quote.  they seem like good people on the phone, and have four or five different brands available...they also told me to stay away from Goodman when I asked."
915410,leaf4,2015-05-16 02:56:00,2466,"A good brand in terms of availability in parts would be York, carrier or trane,( I have a Payne which is basically a carrier) Lennox has a nice product but we have sometimes had issues with getting parts in a timely manner, York is also going through some re engineering or something as they've put all of their economisers for certain sizes of their predator series rooftops on hold and won't ship any out until they figure out the engineering behind it"
915413,NANUK,2015-05-16 03:07:00,797,"Careful with Lennox, they have a line of furnace with aluminum heat exchanger, not durable. No experience with York residential stuff but their rooftop stuff is POS"
915515,Steve,2015-05-17 20:04:00,2075,"Well, I purchased a York YCJD 24 2.0 TON AC this afternoon.  $2,480, installed, incl taxes.  10 Year parts/labour warranty.  $1,500 less than my first two quotes, and they were Goodman AC's.  Read some reviews on the system...like all reviews, some were good, some were bad. Only time will tell.  At least it was in our price range...  Thanks for all the help folks. Being installed this Thursday."

915814,mikemcmillan,2015-05-19 18:28:00,50,"Congrats Steve, that's a nice deal. Now all you need is some hot weather to put it to good use. Enjoy Mike"
913867,Steve,2015-05-06 00:12:00,2075,"Need new central AC for sure.  May upgrade furnace at same time.  I'm located on Hamilton Mountain.  HVAC is a trade that I'm very leery about. Anyone have any trusted recommendations?  Not looking to skimp out on quality. 3 years in my home and plan on being here for a while. So I'll pay the $$$ required for top quality.  Just want to ensure I'm dealing with a good, reputable company."
913887,ketchenany,2015-05-06 01:25:00,3229,Look out for energy upgrade rebates from the government and contractors. You can save lots of $$s. Shop around for deals.
913893,irishfield,2015-05-06 01:31:00,26272,Rattletrap2...
913894,Old Ironmaker,2015-05-06 01:32:00,8243,Boonstra  is a company my family has dealt with for 60 years in Hamilton. They are above board.
913918,leaf4,2015-05-06 02:09:00,2466,"Wouldn't deal with Boonstra, hackers. I've had to repair some commercial work of theirs on a few occasions. I work for Arvin air and while we mainly do commercial/industrial, I'm sure the office wouldn't turn away residential work. we aren't the cheapest out there but we do it right the first time"
913939,chris.brock,2015-05-06 03:32:00,4053,"I went through this 2 years ago. Boonstra was a about $300 cheaper than Sears but I went with Sears, better warranty.  My furnace was old but working fine. My AC was toast. It was worth it to do both at the same time.  I had 5 estimates. A lot of weaselly, used car salesmen types in that business."
913948,Old Ironmaker,2015-05-06 04:58:00,8243,I'm surprised if Boonstra doesn't have the reputation they once had. But a comment from a competitor calling them hackers drumming up business on a fishing forum might be somewhat biased.
913955,leaf4,2015-05-06 10:57:00,2466, And as I alluded to earlier I'm not even sure the office would accept residential work as we do mainly commercial industrial. And I'm not sure how long Boonstra has been around but Arvin has been around since 1972 and there's a reason for that
913978,G.mech,2015-05-06 13:51:00,830,Reputable residential HVAC contractors are about as common as unicorns.
913981,leaf4,2015-05-06 14:16:00,2466,"+1 to that. Residential workers are the reason a lot of people are leery and I don't disagree with them, there's a reason their trade ticket is half as long as mine is"
914128,Steve,2015-05-07 13:18:00,2075,so then.........who can I call not to get ripped off?  I'll get a quote from boonstra.
914129,leaf4,2015-05-07 13:37:00,2466,"Rennie is a decent operation, I had a buddy from school used to work there"
914143,Canuck2fan,2015-05-07 17:29:00,1444,"Whatever you do DO NOT count on getting any guberment rebate cheque. My parents got a new furnace and were ""promised"" it would get a guberment rebate by Reliance. When they applied for it, the guberment said it didn't meet the criterion and Reliance didn't know my parents were customers (unless they were cashing a payment cheque.)  When I looked into it there was no reason it shouldn't have went through all the paperwork was right, the furnace did qualify according to the specs, but even a call to the MPP's office couldn't change the ruling... So don't count on it coming through."
914153,Steve,2015-05-07 18:04:00,2075,"C2F, I've read that story likely 10 times from different people.  I don't trust the government to ever give me money.....  I own the house. I will own the system. I don't need to government to give me money because I'm buying something for my house.  I just don't want to get ripped off on my purchase....HVAC, Roofers, and Plumbers all need to be carefully reviewed."
914155,LostAnotherOne,2015-05-07 18:10:00,956,Just a thought Steve.  You said you may upgrade furnace too.  You never know you could get another 5+ years out of it.  Not sure how much you save if purchase together.
914158,Steve,2015-05-07 18:25:00,2075,"i know i could get another 5 years out of my furnace...at least.  but part of the sham/concern with HVAC is they will always try to convince you that you need a furnace at the same time as well....  after reading tons of info on the net, it truly does sound like sometimes you do, but other times you don't.  that's one of my concerns relating to finding someone reliable and honest."
914161,LostAnotherOne,2015-05-07 18:30:00,956,Your doing your due diligence for sure Steve
914167,leaf4,2015-05-07 18:52:00,2466,How old is your existing furnace and is it a mid or high efficiency?
914170,Steve,2015-05-07 19:10:00,2075,mid efficiency - not high.  don't have a big house. heats it very quickly.  I believe it is 1988. I believe my AC unit is original (likely late 60's or early 70's).
914172,leaf4,2015-05-07 19:19:00,2466,If it were my house I'd replace both you'll see a nice energy savings
914176,G.mech,2015-05-07 19:46:00,830,"If it were my house I'd replace both you'll see a nice energy savings  x2, if you can afford it change them both,  You will see a huge difference on your hydro and gas bills with the new equipment over that vintage.  Your furnace was likely only 77% efficiency when it was brand new and will be down considerably from there even if well maintained.  A new one will be 92% or higher which is a fair difference.  The furnace change will mean more installation work however as the venting, gas, ductwork and condensate drains will likely need to be re-worked or replaced.  With your A/C, you will see a difference from the old worn out 9 or 10 SEER stuff to even a new 13 SEER unit.  You can get anywhere from 13 SEER to 17 SEER efficiency ratings on your condensing units but the higher rated ones cost a lot more and I'm not sure the cost is justified (the SEER rating system is somewhat misleading).  I think you would be pleasantly surprised how much better the 13 SEER is than the old clunker on power usage and performance.  As far as brands go, they're all pretty similar any more.  I would stick with Carrier, York, Trane, or Payne as they are all fairly popular and most guys can service them.  Goodman is popular now too and there's lots of other stuff on the market but from what I've seen they're quite as nice as the ones I mentioned.  Choosing a contractor is the hard part unless you know someone or have a good referral.   Most of the installers will give you similar prices but you'll really have to grill them and make sure you're clear on what each is providing."
914178,leaf4,2015-05-07 19:58:00,2466,"I'd stay away from Goodman, have some quality issues other than that all are a good quality.. If you're going to be in the house for a considerable amount of time I would look at a dual stage furnace you'll save a ton in gas, one of my co workers had a $50 gas bill this past winter when mine was $130 and I have a 6 year old high eff. Given my house is older by about 40 years lol"

I don't think it a case that you need to get both at the same time.  Replacing both at the same time is lot cheaper than replacing each one individually.  If you replace your A/C now and your furnace two years from now you will spend more than if you replace them both at once.  Based on the age of your units; I would replace both."
914233,livinisfishin,2015-05-08 00:16:00,661,If you replace them both get a case coil for the a/c. It will be a nice tight fit to the furnace and it should match. No fabricating the ductwork for the a/c coil that way. It makes a cleaner looking job and a smaller transition from the plenum to the furnace would be needed .
