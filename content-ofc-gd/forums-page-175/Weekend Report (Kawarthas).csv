It's been a bit of a slow spring so far compared to last year at the same spot.  On the plus side, I haven't seen many anglers either, so we haven't had to share our spot with others as much this year.  We did get some nice fish, but with long droughts in between them.  We ended up with a half dozen walleye, a couple of hefty OOS smallies (promptly released, no pics), and quite possibly the biggest crappie I have ever seen in person (16.5"", 1.9#).  We also saw a 36""-40"" musky cruise right by the shoreline, it was quite the sight!  All in all, I couldn't have asked for a better weekend fishing with friends and family.  We didn't take too many pics, they are tough at night sometimes, but it's not a report without the porn (sorry for the crops but trying not to advertise my spot  ):             "
915633,Dutch01,2015-05-18 17:45:00,1431,My friend's Son caught the crappie of a lifetime.  What a smile!    
915643,Sinker,2015-05-18 18:14:00,8692,That crappie is massive! WTG!  S.

915649,Joey,2015-05-18 18:43:00,9122,"Woohoo, nice fish.  That crappie is a monster, way to go"
915659,Dutch01,2015-05-18 19:32:00,1431,It's going to be a tall order for the little guy to catch a crappie bigger than that one.  That's actually the only crappie I've ever seen caught at that spot. We were very surprised when we first saw it.
915675,Gallie,2015-05-18 21:30:00,1215,"Wow that slab is a slob,thats the biggest crappie ive ever seen!"
915701,BillM,2015-05-19 00:26:00,17367,"That crappie actually made me chuckle, what a toad!"

915771,MCTFisher9120,2015-05-19 11:00:00,3761,"Nice report guys, the crappie is massive haha nice job!  Thanks for posting."
915799,fishnsled,2015-05-19 14:56:00,3520,Great crappie!!  The walleye ain't so bad either but man that is a hell of a crappie!
915815,AKRISONER,2015-05-19 18:32:00,5558,jesus that is literally the biggest crappie ever ahaha wow
915816,adempsey,2015-05-19 18:57:00,1498,Nice fish.   The Crappie in the Kawarthas can be monsters.  Weird thing for me is that I usually only catch one mixed in with other species.
915817,NAW,2015-05-19 18:58:00,4022,Holy cow..  That's a beast eh!!
915820,blaque,2015-05-19 19:06:00,2419, That's actually the only crappie I've ever seen caught at that spot.  Of course it is.............it ate all the other crappie
915843,can u fish,2015-05-19 23:04:00,326,Awesome that sure is a huge Crappie congrats to the young fella.
915851,Dutch01,2015-05-19 23:43:00,1431,"Thanks for the 'gratz all.  Hoping to make it back there this weekend.  Good luck guys.   :Gonefishing:     EDIT just looked up the Ontario record, it's 17"" (3.78#) so this guy was close on length but nowhere near the weight.  Still beats any crappie I ever caught!"
916159,T-Bone,2015-05-21 18:51:00,160,"(sorry for the crops but trying not to advertise my spot  ):  Seriously? The area known as the 'Kawarthas' is about 3,400 square miles, and the pics are taken at night. I think you're spot is safe....  Nice fish. That crappie is ridiculous..."
