Looking for a place where they sell farm fresh cow's milk (not the watered down version lol).  I am sure there are places but if anyone knows of any farms along those routes (hwy 8 or surrounding highways going to Goderich) I would appreciate it.  Also I am pretty sure you guys know the answer to this, but if I do find that milk, and boil it, I wont get sick right?"
916468,manitoubass2,2015-05-23 15:34:00,11391,Boiled milk?  Drink some water
916470,huzzsaba,2015-05-23 15:37:00,884,boiled then cooled down lol.  That's what they do back home
916471,manitoubass2,2015-05-23 15:41:00,11391,Lol sorry i cant help  We dont drink milk
916472,Freshtrax,2015-05-23 15:42:00,2215,The only place I know of is just outside Alliston. Sheldon's dairy.   I believe there are only a few in ontairo allows to pasteurize and sell on site.    It's one concession west of  hwy 50.  In between 20th and 25th sideroads    The chocolate milk is crazy good.   And they also make Iice cream.     Not on the way for you though.
916474,huzzsaba,2015-05-23 15:53:00,884,Thanks Freshtrax.  I will be heading up that way sometime this summer so I will definitely check it out!
916486,tb4me,2015-05-23 18:05:00,3295,"Call around to the local dairy farmers.. They are not supposed to sell raw milk..In the USA farmers are being arrested and hauled off to jail for selling raw milk..Your best bet would be to find a farmer that is willing to ""trade"" for some fresh raw milk. Perhaps inquire at your local fall  fairs."
916489,ketchenany,2015-05-23 18:39:00,3229,"There is a farmer in Ontario that was selling shares in his heard so he was not legally selling it the GOV took him to court, I think it's still ongoing."
916490,captpierre,2015-05-23 18:41:00,2521,"That's right. It's illegal for a dairy farmer to sell you raw milk. The reason is for your own safety. There are several potential pathogens you can pick up. The farmers drink it raw themselves  but they are used to it. If you're not, DON'T!  Especially  kids. Homo milk is barely watered down. About 3% fat."
916513,Gerritt,2015-05-23 22:25:00,6129,Schmidt.  He lost in the end  G
916525,huzzsaba,2015-05-23 23:53:00,884,"Thanks for the replies. Its not like I got to have whole milk, but being originally from india,  and having tried what they use which I believe is 7%. They use the milk to make their special tea,as well as other things like butter etc. No doubt it can be made with homo milk but its nice once in a while to use the heavier stuff.  I heard some stores like whole foods may carry it, so I will be checking it out.  thanks!"
916533,manitoubass2,2015-05-24 01:41:00,11391,I used to be a milk addict lol. Every meal needed milk.  Ive quit that years ago. I prefered homo  I cannot imagine 7% at all lol.  How thick is that? Must be a milkshake lol
916548,huzzsaba,2015-05-24 04:12:00,884,"Yeah Its pretty thick but I have no trouble drinking it when I visit the in laws back home. Now the cream that comes up after boiling it is a different story lol. Thats the stuff they make butter with and I literally tried half a spoon of it and it felt like the room was spinning lol.  At home here, I use 2%."
916553,Old Ironmaker,2015-05-24 09:39:00,8243,Milk is for weaning children and mammals. No other mammal but humans drink milk as adults. Milks for babies.
916555,dave524,2015-05-24 09:47:00,4508,"There is what we call half and half cream at 10% and a light cream at 5% , would either of those not work for your teas?"
916584,huzzsaba,2015-05-24 14:39:00,884,"lol yes I have tried all the creams upto 35% just like I would put in coffee.  The way the tea is made over there is that it is boiled in the milk for a while.  Like I said, I don't have to have it.  its just nice to try it once in a while if its available."
916670,Musky or Specks,2015-05-24 21:02:00,2710,My family are dairy farmers going back a couple generation. It's illegal to sell milk. My uncles have to pouur it down the drain when they are over quota.That being said family gey all the free unpastuerized mik we can stand.
916684,Old Ironmaker,2015-05-24 21:49:00,8243,Buy a Cappuccino machine and pour it in your Tea instead of Espresso.
916697,Gerritt,2015-05-24 22:39:00,6129,"Indian tea is different then what we consider tea....  The tea itself is boiled in the milk, vs water.... And is often very sweet.  I personally have had it several times, it's awesome!"
