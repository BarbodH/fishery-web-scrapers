915372,misfish,2015-05-15 21:20:00,29133,"I have caught 2 lakers at the same time while down rigg,n. Both on seperate lures though, but same main line.  Thats pretty cool to see two eyes (well really 4) on one lure.LOL  Im sure you were as surprised as I was."
915502,SHAD,2015-05-17 14:20:00,134,That's awesome!  Great when the feed bag is on eh!  New definition of a 'double header'
915508,manitoubass2,2015-05-17 17:04:00,11391,I like that lure too mike.  Thats a go to for me on the river
915867,Sinker,2015-05-20 01:10:00,8692,"Had a neat one happen today. The GF was trolling a worm harness, with her rod in the holder. Shes messing around on her phone and I see her rod getting picked at by a panfish....i tell her, and she say yeah, I know. I keep watching her rod, she keeps messing with her phone and BAM...the rod goes berzerk. Turns out she caught a walleye, and a small perch on the same spinner. I guess the walleye went for the perch....nice eye too....23""er.  S."
916248,mike rousseau,2015-05-22 05:05:00,4661,"Almost had it happen again Sunday night... We got a walleye and a second one folllowed it right to the boat and you could see it was trying to go at the lure... We almost got both in the net before the second fish spooked.,. Lol"
916569,Rod Caster,2015-05-24 12:39:00,5784,Holy cow they like your bait! That's awesome haha.
914772,mike rousseau,2015-05-12 08:41:00,4661,"So I went night fishing after work tonight as the night bite has been amazing so far this season... We are catching plenty of fish and the night is going good... Then I get a bite and the fish is coming in easily... Them I feel a hard thump and everything got heavier... Now on the st lawrence river first thought is ""a musky got my walleye"".... But after a few seconds passed it didn't feel like a musky... Then I see something surface and I said ""I musta hooked a walleye in the side"" cause it looked like my lure was hanging off the side of the walleye... As it got closer I realized that the thump I felt moments into the fight was actually a second walleye hitting my lure... That's right I got a double header on a 2 hook crankbait and successfully landed them both... I've never seen that and I doubt I ever will again... This is a catch I'll never forget...  "
914774,crappieperchhunter,2015-05-12 09:40:00,2582,Thx for sharing Mike. I had a similair experience years ago at my parents cottage. Two 3LB smallies on a rapala. Not much of a fight because they where kinda doing a tug of war against each other. I was glad my brother was in the boat as a witness as I never had a camera with me.
914784,Steve,2015-05-12 11:02:00,2075,"I've done two walleye on a 3 way rig (""two lure"" 3 way rig)....  but never two walleye on one lure.  cool!"
914788,Acountdeleted,2015-05-12 11:41:00,2562,Wow! Super cool.
914789,BillM,2015-05-12 11:42:00,17367,Sweet!  Done that twice with smallmouth!
914790,wallyboss,2015-05-12 11:43:00,1095,"Nice ,  my surprise double-header was a bit different I was reeling it in and when it got close to the boat I put the net in the water and as I was guiding the  1  1/2 lbs walleye into the net all I saw was this huge pike jump out of the water and straight into the net with the walleye.  It was an 8lbs pike. scared the crap out of me.  I am sure glad I didn't try to grab the walleye with my hand or it would have been a trip to teh emergency!!"
914791,kickingfrog,2015-05-12 11:44:00,8333,"Wow. I've seen that with bass, panfish and pike on a fly-in but never with eyes and big ones at that not 2 juveniles."
914792,NAW,2015-05-12 11:55:00,4022,Thats awesome!
914796,PBenson,2015-05-12 12:30:00,154,That's crazy
914800,Sinker,2015-05-12 12:52:00,8692,"That's cool! I got two eyes on a worm harness one time, but one of them was only about 10"" long.....the second one must have tried to get the little guy, and got hooked on the back hook. It was a nice one....landed them both. Pretty cool!  S."
914801,Joey,2015-05-12 13:50:00,9122,That's pretty cool !!!
914803,manitoubass2,2015-05-12 13:54:00,11391,Hahahaha thats awesome Mike!
914813,mike rousseau,2015-05-12 14:58:00,4661,Thanks everyone...  Now I get to chirp up my buddies a bit cause they've got all the biggest walleye this year... They were chirpin me up then I did this... They shut up pretty quick and I got lippy... Lmao

914820,Toronto_Angler,2015-05-12 15:46:00,698,And here I am with trouble catching one! lol great stuff!
914822,Joeytier,2015-05-12 16:09:00,3990,Awesome story...they aren't small fish either!
914830,DRIFTER_016,2015-05-12 16:52:00,10439,Somewhere I have a picture of 32# and 18# lakers on the same rig. Landed too.
914839,mike rousseau,2015-05-12 17:43:00,4661,"Both were 20-23"""
914840,mike rousseau,2015-05-12 17:44:00,4661,That would be nuts
914845,Headhunter,2015-05-12 17:55:00,5703,"I've caught two Largies on the same Rapala, J11 once... but never pickereyes! What a coup! HH"
914848,jbailey,2015-05-12 18:14:00,866,That's awesome! thanks for sharing
914869,netminder,2015-05-12 20:06:00,514,That's awesome. Best I've ever done is catch two perch with a jig and a 2 inch trailer. One took the jig the other took the trailer. Same worm too the greedy buggers
914871,fishnsled,2015-05-12 20:10:00,3520,"I've had it happen with largemouth, smallies and panfish before.  Always cool when it happens, never seen or heard of it with walleyes though.  That is very cool!"
914873,davey buoy,2015-05-12 20:18:00,5505,"Nice Mike,once in a lifetime,if your lucky lol."
915302,Mister G,2015-05-15 09:42:00,1429,"I once witnessed  while fishing in a stream, a sucker caught by two different anglers on opposite sides of the creek. They both reeled in and the fish was hanging mid-stream over the water. WEIRD and wish I had a camera back then."
