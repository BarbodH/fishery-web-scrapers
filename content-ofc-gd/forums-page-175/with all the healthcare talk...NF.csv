Wake up at 530 this morning to my 11 year old son(Jigger) crying about a stomach ache. Quick daddy diagnosis, appendicitis. Wife gears up and shes off to rainy river emerge.  Dr sees the signs, blood work and urine sample and hes off to fort frances for more tests. Diagnosis was right and hes under the knife by 5pm  He should be discharged tomorrow after a few morphine trips and on the road to recovery.  Well played drs, well played?"
915756,limeyangler,2015-05-19 03:17:00,5204,tell him get well from me Rick.
915758,manitoubass2,2015-05-19 03:19:00,11391,Will do Simon! Thank ya!

915762,bigugli,2015-05-19 04:09:00,6138,I am glad your son was looked after quickly and effectively. It's the type of outcome we would like to see and hear all the time.
915787,manitoubass2,2015-05-19 13:38:00,11391,"Hopefully hes discharged today?  He off morphine and just on tylenol, feeling good but really hungry lol.  In over 35 hours hes had one jello, my poor boy is starving!"
915797,fishnsled,2015-05-19 14:48:00,3520,All the best to your son for a speedy recovery.  Nice to hear the process went quickly.  I'd be ready to go postal if I hadn't eaten for that long!  lol  Hopefully he has something soon!
915802,manitoubass2,2015-05-19 15:09:00,11391,Lol I hear ya. 8 hours tops for me.  Methinks the morphine kills the appetite though.  Just got word hes still in alot of pain. More morphine. Ill think they will end up keeping him one more night if necessary.  Sucks only having one vehicle and being an hour away. Id sure like to go see him
915804,manitoubass2,2015-05-19 15:10:00,11391,And thanks for all the well wishes?  Its gonna drive him bonkers to be laid up in the nice weather. Poor boy

They were so good to him it was unreal. Surgery is so scary for a child, and they had him so comfy he wasnt scared at all?  First day off morphine, at home with family and doing well?  Thanks again for the comments/well wishes.  Never fun to see your son in surgery but some drs/nurses are just plain awesome:)"

After reading it-  I'm another well wisher Rick and happy to hear things are looking good. Scary for sure, but a good news story in the end."
