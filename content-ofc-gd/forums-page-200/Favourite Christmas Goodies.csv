886353,Old Ironmaker,2014-12-13 08:30:00,8243,Oh man these cookies are reminding me of Moms Christmas Rum balls and making me hungry. Basically a round short bread cookie with big chunks of walnuts and a big amount of Ron Bacardi sprinkled with icing sugar. She hasn't baked in years due to her health. Need to get the recipe for my wife. The only thing I bake is home made Pizza.

I asked her for the recipe before she died and it was a pinch of this a spoon full of that , plain voodoo science. Anyone got a recipe for maple fudge?  The trick with fudge is that is always a formula, so measuring correctly is important, I know my grandmother could make fudge by just grabbing some of this and a bit of that. It always worked. When I started cooking for a living I asked her for recipe and she said she didn't need one.  The funny thing was when she went to show me how she made it, her favorite pot for making it was full of soup on the stove. She grabbed a different pot and knocked together her ingredients and made the BEST chocolate SAUCE anyone who had it had ever tasted.  So she was measuring it and usually fairly accurately by how far up the ingredients went on the side of the usual pot when she put them in. Without THAT pot she was just a bit off and it wouldn't set, but made into milkshakes it was delicious LOL.  The other important thing for getting the consistency you want is to get the sugar mixture to the correct temperatures. So either being good at using the cold water and drop method or having a decent candy thermometer is a must.  Once you get it a few times you will shocked at how simple it is."

My Mom has advanced Alzheimers and all her recipes (at least all my favorites) are all locked up forever in her mind.  Any baking that I watched my Mom do for XMas was done without a recipe.  It was all by habit.  When it was baking time in our house she would be at it for days on end.  I remember her making 250 meat pies in a weekend.

887010,bigugli,2014-12-16 15:38:00,6138,"  Sorry to hear that about your mother.  I am thankful that in our household life centered in the kitchen. Long before my grandmother developed alzheimers and dementia, I had already learnt and mastered most of Gram's old favourites. Part of growing up meant sitting yourself in the kitchen to ""help"" Gram with the baking. At 5 or 6 that meant ""testing"" the batter and helping to decorate the cookies, making your own personal sticky bun, and scraping the bowls clean when all was done.  Man, what a sugar fix that was. By age 13 it meant you were doing the mixing and kneading of the dough, and shaping the loaves of bread when Gram's arthritis started to bother her hands. Going to the meat shop to pick out the biggest and best turkey and ham under My Gram's watchful eye and helping her prep the beast  for the oven. Same went for Swedish meatballs or cabbage rolls. There was/is no recipe. it's all about taste and texture. I'd give up everything just to relive one of those Christmases with my Gram"
887373,wallyboss,2014-12-17 21:13:00,1095,I do have all the techniques down path but not the recipes!!!   I was also the Taste Tester. I do remember saying that I wasn't too sure and that I would need a bit more to be sure. I seemed to have the touch of how much ground clove to add into the meat pies!!

In my family, that means getting very busy in the kitchen, preparing a feast of Christmas goodies. Like most Finns and Swedes, there is no shortage of comfort foods in the household. Last night  we started by making 5lbs of Swedish meatballs.  I still have to crank out 4  or 5 batches of cookies, 1 or 2 batches of pulla (Christmas bread), pumpkin pie, turnip and squash casseroles, devilled eggs, etc... From the store I need a supply of fresh nuts, ambrosia, and 3 or 4 types of sil.  This list does not include all the favourites that mother has started to prepare. She already started a week earlier."
