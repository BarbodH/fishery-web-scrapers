While not yet confirmed, it is believed that he has now passed from this mortal coil into the ether of eternity. We will miss you as we now have no-one left to tease about not making dates."
887962,DRIFTER_016,2014-12-21 05:05:00,10439,"So sad, he was sooooooo young."
887967,Freshtrax,2014-12-21 07:05:00,2215,"man i red the title and was like ""man i'm gonna miss that guy""   i almost had a heart ttack"
887973,Spiel,2014-12-21 13:29:00,9065,"Sad really, guess I'll have to close his account."
887976,Fish Farmer,2014-12-21 13:48:00,2234,"Lets teach him and not go to his funeral.   And we even had a nice cold glass of beer waiting for him and 2 lbs. of his favorite wings.  We couldn't see that go to waste, so I hope he forgives us for drinking his beer and eating his wings.  Kinda made me feel guilty"
888015,manitoubass2,2014-12-21 18:23:00,11391,I can see the humour in this (if you followed the GTG thread)  id edit the title though for sure.  and im sure hes chillin with a beer watching the NFL right now!!!  ?

888024,Blue Lk,2014-12-21 20:09:00,337,"""Lets teach him and not go to his funeral"" I don't go to funerals because I know they aren't coming to mine"
888025,Burtess,2014-12-21 20:20:00,901,"Lol..... I guess somebody thought my comment and condolences was serious too since it was deleted.... but you should have noted that I referred to Old Ironmaker as ""Old Ironman"" lol....  Burt"
888054,LostAnotherOne,2014-12-22 00:13:00,956,I appreciated the advice he gave me on my upcoming trip to Nipissing next month.  RIP
888068,Old Ironmaker,2014-12-22 01:21:00,8243,"It was close. the Dr's didn't think I would make it through the night. Bottom line is the boys and I celebrated a bit yesterday afternoon and I won't drink and die. When they dropped me off my wife said "" you are not going anywhere!"" Smart lady she is.  I guess I'm going to miss my own funeral, again, but thanks for the condolences regardless. Please send money.  Sounds like you all had a good time even without the free entertainment."
