887012,chris.brock,2014-12-16 15:53:00,4053," thanks guys,  Mr Spiel you're in, and we'll make an exception for Bunk. Jeff, the big lakes were wide open, I didn't drive by Cedar but I'm guessing that would be a little dicey.  Stockers Julian"

887443,Fish Farmer,2014-12-18 13:25:00,2234,Great report guys. Kinda reminds me years ago snowmobiling into the park for Specks.

887808,Locnar,2014-12-20 04:02:00,645,Couple of bruiser brookies! Well done guys. I'm off all winter if you want a fishing pal
888229,Tim Mills,2014-12-23 03:41:00,476,"cool report thanks for posting, glad you guys did well"
886800,chris.brock,2014-12-15 18:17:00,4053,"There's a small appendix in the fishing regs. It gives the gps coordinates for a small lake, and a special regulation that only people with the first name Chris are allowed to fish the lake. Very bizarre. So away we go...   We took off some layers and bushwacked into Chris Lake.     Just so Ironmaker doesn't give us heck , we took some safety precautions. I take the axe and start working my way out, checking as I go.      We each had a long rope. We had a towel, dry clothes and waterproof matches in a dry bag, just in case.   These little guys kept us busy, banging into our set lines, pretty frequently.      I was first to set the bar a little higher.      We had some interesting conversations.  Chris- ""Did you know I have only 2 toes on my left foot"" Chris-`That`s awesome! What happened?"" Chris- ""Muskie, Chemong Lake""   Chris- ""I just tried to pass gas but it may not have been all gas"" Chris- ""I didn't really want to know that""   Chris- ""Have you ever seen a sasquatch?"" Chris- ""Yes, I can communicate with them vocally and by tree knocking""     Chris gets a light bite and the battle is on.      Titanic brookie, big fish of the day.     A fun day, all fish released."

886994,crappieperchhunter,2014-12-16 15:01:00,2582,Specs through the ice still on my bucket list so I'm green with envy right now. Good job guys and thx for sharing.  Kudos on releasing them all too. I grew up fishing creek specs and love the little buggers in the frying pan. Would have been difficult for me not to keep a few little ones.
