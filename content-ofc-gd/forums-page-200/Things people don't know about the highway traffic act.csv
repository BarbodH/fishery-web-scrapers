Driver arrives at stop, waiting for traffic to clear on main to make a left turn. In the meantime I arrive at stop waiting to go thru. When traffic clears driver waits for me thinking I have the ROW-----but I don't! I wait a few secs in case he/she just has slow reaction time. Then one of us waves the other on. It would be nice and make for better traffic flow if the drivers knew that the 'left is last' rule is just a tie breaker for the case when both drivers arrive at the same time.  It's funny you mention that one because I was taught that 'left was last' when I took drivers ed many moons ago. My teenage kids recently corrected me as they have been taught that the first one there has the right of way (which I argued but lost when we looked it up)...and here I thought I knew everything"

It didn't have standard turn signal lights either but instead had a switch on the dash that you flipped left or right and a little lighted arm would pop out of the door post just behing the front doors. When you completed your turn you flipped the switch back to center and  the little arm folded back in again.  Funny little car but alot of fun to drive.  Wonder how many folks would even know what it was today if they saw those little arms flipping out   I too took my test in an Austin, 1966 in a '59 A55 Austin Cambridge. It had the directional turn lights but previously we had an '49 and a '52 that had the flip out arms , they were retired b4 I started to drive.  As to turning left on a amber, if I see that the intersection has an advance green, I often will now wait at the white bar on the pavement without entering the intersection  unless I see a break in on coming traffic, wait out the red and go on the next advance green. Had a few scares over the years with oncomers who have plenty of time to stop running the amber. This however really PO's the vehicles behind me and my wife if she is with me. Great to be old"

Approaching, following emergency vehicles Stop on approach of vehicle with flashing lights or bell or siren sounding   It's been 47 years now since I joined the Fire Dept. and back then when Toronto drivers heard a siren, they moved outta the way and stopped just like their sposed to.  When I retired 14 years ago things had changed in a BIG way and 1/2 the drivers on the road had absolutely NO idea what they were sposed to do. Some seemed completely oblivious to the sirens and just continued on their merry way. Others got totally confused and I've even seen them come to a complete stop in the middle of the road forcing us to go around them.  Toronto is a wild & crazy place to drive now and IMHO I think a huge problem is the fact that so many new immigrants have come from places in the world where they never saw heavy traffic and emergency vehicles are totally foreign to them and when they encounter them they just don't understand what to do.

192723,Canuck2fan,2008-04-26 16:35:00,1444," I guarantee any cop his yearly quota of tickets in about two hours then if they follow that part the HTA at these intersections.... To keep traffic moving I can't see a cop giving a ticket at these intersections I am talking about unless there was an accident.  However, only charging the guy turning left in the event of an accident would ignore the part where the driver with the green light can only enter the intersection when it is clear and safe to do so regardless of the colour of the light as well. Not to mention the part about a car being in an intersection has the right away over cars stopped at a stop sign or red light..... If the officer doesn't charge both drivers that isn't fair either.  Situations like this are where the judges and lawyers earn their money deciding which of the contradictions in the law(s) applies and to whom.  Another thing about these intersections is that you would probably wind up being shot or tire ironed to death if you didn't enter the intersection if your car would fit during the green light.... Rather than have to face the mob behind me I would take my chances on a cop having a bad day, heck most of the time they are the 6th or 7th car to go through. I am pretty sure once you met with the crown, told them you would fight it because of the location and why they would drop it or reduce it to a weaker charge if you agreed to pay the full fine. The crowns I have met could give a crap about anything but the cash first meetings are more like lets a make deal than justice as you probably well know. If that didn't work then I would definitely roll the dice in court, maybe at some time your brethren have charged the JP for the same thing (yeah like that would ever happen)LOL"
192738,Bernie,2008-04-26 17:02:00,3190,Not trying to be an    here but you may want to double check the lighting. When doing safety inspections all that is required is one taillight and one license light on non-commercial. Turns and braking can be signaled by hand. Been over this with the MTO a couple times. I think that it is a poor regulation and should be updated but no one seems interested in changing things. There are many changes I would like to see but get stonewalled every time I make a call.
192752,fishing n autograph,2008-04-26 17:36:00,2540," no problem bernie...... there's a lot of the Ontario Regulations that I couldn't really tell you about...especially for commercial trucks etc.....in fact, to know that stuff there's a course you have to take called ""heavy truck interdiction"" which basically gives you the qualifications to do MTO inspections."

Unless something is completely obvious or one driver is completely honest then it's easier. But if there's no third party witness it's harder to get a conviction because both drivers are looking out for their best interest and aren't 100% honest....."

192798,Canuck2fan,2008-04-26 20:24:00,1444, That seems fair to me to not charge anybody if there is any doubt in a collision with no injuries. Their insurance will likely cause them more pain than a charge could anyway.  As an aside I pity any officer who has to rely on eye witnesses for anything though. I work at two different jobs and I can count on the fingers of one hand the times that when something bad has happened that any two people tell the same story but you know they were THERE and the was no way they could have missed what happened..... it is all about spin.

Yea I think the reg says something like, a vehicle less then 20 feet long and less then 8 feet wide; only require those two lights on the rear. The driver's side window must be able to open, to perform hand signals. There's nothing about that window having to go back up. Window doesn't go down, vehicle fails inspection; throw a hammer through window, vehicle now passes. LOL  I was pulled over in my 50 Chevy by a city cop, for making an improper lane change. I was in the left lane and needed to be in the right; I made the hand signal and moved into the right lane. The cop was already in the right lane a couple cars back; because he didn't see a turn signal light, he pulled me over. At first he didn't believe me that the car never had signal lights when the car was built. After having a look inside the car and saw no sign of a signal light switch; he admitted that if I did make a hand signal, he wouldn't have been able to see it and let me go. The next day I installed a universal switch and rewired the car to accommodate signals. No more people waving at me while I was making a turn; not to many now what hand signals are anymore.  Dan."

192639,Andrew,2008-04-26 12:49:00,54,Back to running amber lights... I've noticed in the City or Toronto now that instead of the pedestrian hand flashing they have COUNTDOWN timers..  Who's bright idea was this?  As far as I can tell it just tells the car coming towards it and the person crossing the street that they need to SPEED up before the light changes?  How many people do you think see that timer at say 3 or 4 seconds and gun it to get through the light?  Which is more dangerous?
192652,Gerritt,2008-04-26 13:35:00,6129,FnA stay in Vaughan PLEASE!!! noone in that god forsaken city knows how to drive! they turn left from whatever lane they feel like and even indicate they are doing so just so they can get through the advance green and not have to wait behind a truck...  THOUSANDS of trucks in the Creditstone and HWY 7 area... red light runners are rampant!  G
192660,bigfish1965,2008-04-26 13:59:00,3382,"A few more.. Boat trailer safety chains must be fastened in such a way as they do not become easily dislodged (thanks so much for such a vague and silly rule). This essentially means you need rubber stoppers or metal clasps on your trailer chain hooks. I was going to do a demonstration on making your own. If I get a chance this week I will do it and post it. I'm sure more than half the trailers out there don't have that and I still see places like CTC and others selling trailers without them...how on earth that is legal I have no idea.  Something that should be illegal.. Dogs riding in the backs of pick up trucks!! How many times I see this! One quick move and your pup is airborne and likely to die and also likely to cause a crash. PLEASE FishNAutographs and other officers...start writing tickets for unsecure load for these fools. It is my number one pet peeve. If you must have your dog in the back, put in a crate and secure it with tie-downs..give your dog SOME safety."
192678,Tomcat,2008-04-26 14:37:00,395,"Whether your windows are tinted too much is left solely to the discretion of the police officer who stops you. It's my understanding that no police force in Ontario uses a device to ascertain the degree of tint (different levels of Government couldn't agree on who would pay for such a device). Consequently, one officer might ticket you while another officer wouldn't. Regardless the inconsistency involved in the enforcement of this law, I don't understand the need for drivers to be able to see other drivers. I have tinted windows for two reasons:  1. to prohibit people from seeing into my vehicle; and 2. to keep my vehicle cooler (less AC used = less gas burned = less emissions)  The law, such as it is, is only on the books because police forces argued that they must be able to see (through the window) to be able to ascertain whether the driver of a stopped vehicle has a gun. The typical ""shotgun"" approach. I'll suggest that 99.9% of all Ontario drivers stopped by police don't have a gun in their hand. Rather than the existing law,  police should simply request drivers to roll down all windows before they approach the drivers door. If any driver doesn't comply, break the nearest window with a baton."
192697,POLLIWOGG,2008-04-26 15:32:00,835,"If you use hand signals you can rest assured that the guy that just killled you was friendly and waving back.  Extended left arm does not mean ""please pass me"""
192709,shane,2008-04-26 16:14:00,652,"""I don't understand the need for drivers to be able to see other drivers.""  I think being able to see the other driver is a very important part of defensive driving.  I spent my first few years driving a motorcycle and I can tell if a driver is going to cut me off or turn left in front of me just by seeing his/her face.  And it's even more important for pedestrians or cyclists.       JMHO"
192317,fishing n autograph,2008-04-25 17:01:00,2540,"So...after a while i've found out some things that people didn't know about the rules of the road.....so i'll shed some light so guys on here don't get dinged....  1. If you are turning left and the light turns red ONLY ONE vehicle can complete their turn.....i usually see 2-4 people run it....  2. Your permit HAS to be signed in ink  3. You have to have a real insurance card in your vehicle, not a photocopy. Your permit can be copied, but you must have both sides photo copied  4. You cannot make a U-turn: 150m from a hill, dike, bridge, where there's a sign that say no U turn, or where there's a curve in the road  5. You windows cannot be tinted so dark that the driver cannot be seen  6. you have to have both headlights working, identification light (licence plate light) has to be working), but you only need one working break light  7. You have to come to a complete stop at all stop signs and red lights...rolling stops are not stops  8. Amber light means slow down and prepare to stop. Technically running the amber light and going through yields the same penalty as running a red light.  9. When turning left, you must yield the right of way...especially when the light is amber and people running the yellow...if you get into an accident you're at fault.  10. When consuming alcohol the legal limit is .080, however, any reading between .05 and .079 will result in a 12 hour licence suspension.  11. If you have your G2 licence you cannot have any alcohol in your system, drive after midnight with people in the car who are not family or over 18 and drive on 400 series highways  12. Your validation sticker has to fixed to the upper right corner of the rear licence plate - for cars  13. Having a loud stereo, squeeling your tires or having a loud muffler is considered excessive noise and can result in a ticket  14. I recommed not having your dog in the front seat of your car...if it's on the lap of the driver its considered crowding the driver  15. All occupants of your vehicle has to be wearing their seatbelt UNLESS you're a cab driver with a fare, you're reversing, ambulance with a patient, police officer with a prisoner or have a note from your doctor saying that you cannot wear your seat belt for medical reasons  16. Driving with a suspended licence or disqualified licence will get your car towed.  17. Bet you didn't know this...... you can drive ANYWHERE on the road if there is no other traffic on the road  18. Bet you didnt' know this....... if you do not affect other drivers...ie see 17..... you don't have to signal  19. all loads in your pick up truck must be tied down and secured  20. 3Km/hr is a $12 fine lol"
192321,irishfield,2008-04-25 17:07:00,26272,Problem with one brake light is you probably are then in violation of not having a signal light.  ..and Yes I did know 17 and 18 and regularily drive up the center of the road when you can see there's no traffic for miles (especially in places like #11 between Cochrane and Hearst).. gives you more sliding/spinning room when you blow a tire and cuts down on the sucked up dust from the side of the road dirtying up what you're towing.
192323,bpsbassman,2008-04-25 17:09:00,941,Good stuff. Learned a few things there.
192326,fishing n autograph,2008-04-25 17:13:00,2540, on newer vehicles the brake and indicator lights are separate

And, for #17, I thought you can speed and drink as well so long as there was no other traffic."

192387,Victor,2008-04-25 19:07:00,1609," Please correct me if i'm wrong, when i took driving lessons i was told that you can move up towards the first vehicle making a left (assuming you're not the first car) ... when the light turns red, you are allowed to turn if you are passed the white line. That way you won't be blocking the pedestrian crosswalk or the cars going in the perpendicular direction.  I know what you mean about having 3-4 cars turning sometimes though...some people just push it too far sometimes..."
192404,wallyboss,2008-04-25 19:28:00,1095,How about passing a car when you have double full lines.  Some places you have those 2  solid lines but you can clearly see way ahead . Is it illegal to pass or just not suggested to pass???

192444,Andrew,2008-04-25 21:13:00,54," Way back when I had driver training this is the way it was explained to me.... yellow means caution..signs with cruves in the road etc.. they are are warning you to take caution, yellow signs with the speed limit, well thats a recommendation that you should go that speed, and not the actual posted speed (the white sign).  Also, back to the yellow line.. If its safe its my understanding you can pass.  Someone please correct me if I'm wrong."
192448,SlowPoke,2008-04-25 21:27:00,2984," AFAIK double yellow solid suggests that it is unsafe to pass in that area but is prohibited (50 Meters?) before a turn, tunnel, railway crossing or approching the crest of a hill.  Another little known law... Unsafe left turn. If you approach your left turn and are slowing down, check your mirrors prior to turning. You can be charged if some moron hits you while trying to pass on the left even if you have your signal on. I encounter this almost daily at work... it's so tempting to make my turn and let them stuff thier car under my trailer but it's not worth getting charged. -Brian"
192449,Canuck2fan,2008-04-25 21:32:00,1444,"I have disagree with number 1 only allowing one driver to turn on a red light has to be at the discretion of the officer. At more than a few intersections in Waterloo region 4 or 5 cars easily fit past the white line and road sign that indicate the proper stopping point. Once you are past that marking you are considered to be in the intersection and should have the right away regardless of the light changing. Since the HTA reads that all drivers must yield to drivers all ready in the intersection at stop signs and red lights.... (While we ALL KNOW any marking on the surface of any road in Ontario is NOT legally binding and just suggestive because of the fact that they can be covered at anytime by leaves, snow or road grime) the signs designating the stopping position for a red light would be binding. At a few of those intersections any car past the marking would impede a truck from turning on the green, so  the officer would probably lose in court for charging someone turning in those places second to even fifth, if they couldn't back up safely.  Also how could an officer pull over all 3 or 4 cars at once to charge them? Once in court you could make the argument that your being charged, while the other drivers weren't was unfair...."
192454,SlowPoke,2008-04-25 21:42:00,2984,"You can make any argument you want in court but you're dreaming if you think the ""unfair"" defense will get you anywhere."
192464,Jigger,2008-04-25 22:15:00,1237,"  A fellow I knew back in high school killed someone passing on a double solid. When it came to court, he was let off on that very technicality. It is advised/suggested that you don't pass on a double.  Very unfortunate."
192470,Canuck2fan,2008-04-25 22:40:00,1444," It won't hurt to bring it up along with your other arguments.... if you have a witness in the car with you it could help. Remember all you have to do is raise reasonable doubt with the crown first and you might not even get to court. Also if you are lucky and there was a traffic camera at the intersection you can require the footage if available to be entered into evidence to support your statement of unfair treatment. Just remember that all such charges under the HTA that aren't the result of an accident are nothing more than a tax grab, so usually if you show you are willing to fight and not just roll over and pay. The crown will likely give you a deal of a lower charge or withdraw the charges altogether.... Is it worth having an officer go to court to fight a 150 dollar ticket when no one was hurt or no property was damaged? NOPE it is all about maximizing the dollars that roll in not about safety or justice in a lot of traffic charges. Oh and if you can speak another language insist on them providing an interpreter for your case that really cuts down on the profit for them so they tend to let you off a lot easier...."
