888139,manitoubass2,2014-12-22 17:06:00,11391,"im no cop but from the incidents around here its seems to fluctuate wildly.  one young man get a dui and gets a heavy fine and 30 days in jail. lost his license for 3 years I think  another older man with like 7 dui's get another, swings at two officers spends the weekend in jail and a two year license ban.  one other guy gets one dui and serves 7 months weekends in jail with a $5000 doller fine and needs that breathalizer machine to drive again"
888140,Joey,2014-12-22 17:09:00,9122,LOL!
888141,Joey,2014-12-22 17:10:00,9122,Remember when our parents used to drive drunk all the time and we never wore seat belts !!!!!!
888147,fishing n autograph,2014-12-22 17:58:00,2540,"The average I see is a plea out to careless driving, $1000 fine and a 1 yr suspension. I've seen very few drunk drivers go to jail. Maybe 4 of the 300 or so I've dealt with in the last 8 yrs"
888148,irishfield,2014-12-22 17:59:00,26272,"Yah.. I can say I do Joey. My dad ripped me one morning for finding a beer between the seats of the 'Bee when I was 18.. and I ended the conversation with ""who parked your car, at least mines straight!"".  You get that cab returned yet Cliff?"
888152,manitoubass2,2014-12-22 18:23:00,11391,I would think maybe the penelties vary with prior charges etc???
888153,lew,2014-12-22 18:28:00,12766,My bud was driving to his cottage in Dunsford and a car came around a bend on hwy 35 at an estimated 80 MPH on the wrong side of the road and hit my friend head-on. John was decapitated and died instantly and the other car flipped upside down in a ditch and exploded and 4 men burned to death. Autopsies showed the 4 were all stoned drunk.  My bud was father to 4 kids and didn't drink.  There's nothing good comes from drinking and driving.
888154,jbailey,2014-12-22 18:35:00,866,"haha, quite the punchline.  On a serious note, its a terrible desicion. Two of my cousins, 9 and 13 were killed by a drunk driver years ago on highway 6 near caledonia."
888205,Ralph Field,2014-12-23 00:13:00,1018,"Back in 1971 my sister was killed by an impaired driver. The driver was driving a stolen car & had a suspended licence. Because he had many outstanding criminal charges they did not pursue the traffic offences, which has never seemed right to me."
888210,Big Cliff,2014-12-23 01:04:00,6899,If this post offended anyone it wasn't intended to make a joke out of drunk driving or to treat it lightly. I have over the years called in several impared drivers and will do the same as often as I see it.
888213,Entropy,2014-12-23 01:37:00,747,I don't think anyone would take it the wrong way Cliff.  No worries.

888280,fishing n autograph,2014-12-23 18:26:00,2540,Felonies are American. It's an indictable offence however they aren't treated the same as someone who say commits an armed robbery
888289,HTHM,2014-12-23 19:54:00,4082,"My understanding is that the crown has the option to proceed summarily, or by indictment. A summary procedure would carry a max sentence of two years less a day and is held in a lower level court, while proceeding by indictment will result in an exposure to the maximum sentence allowed by law and is held in superior court. Similar to felony vs misdemeanor in the US. Correct me if I am wrong."
888293,davey buoy,2014-12-23 20:22:00,5505,"I think 99% of us got the joke,that was all it was.We all know drinking and driving is a offense Let's have a laugh for what it is ,thanks Cliff!!!!!!!!!!"
888295,Steelheadphycho,2014-12-23 20:36:00,470,Thanks everyone for the clarification..........  ........ And the joke was pretty funny Cliff!   Happy holidays everyone!!
888296,lew,2014-12-23 20:40:00,12766,"Just to clarify Cliff, when I told about my friend being killed by a drunk driver I didn't mean to say anything against your joke, which I thought was darned good.  Sorry if it came across the wrong way.  "
888303,Big Cliff,2014-12-23 21:50:00,6899,"Thanks Lew, and anyone else that have had friends or family killed by a drunk driver. None of you came across in the wrong way but reading some of your posts reminded me what the real cost is!  I am guilty of driving drunk; when I was a teen we always had a six pack (or more) on the seat beside us. We drank and drove all the time and no one ever seemed to get hurt. Maybe the cars were better built, maybe there were just less cars on the road, might be they just didn't go as fast, I'm not sure what the answer is. (I do remember sitting drinking with a couple of the cops when I lived in French River and we all drove home and made it)  Quite frankly I think that anyone who causes injury or the death of someone while DUI should be charged with attempted murder or murder but this is not that kind of world.  Anyway, it is far better to steal a cab than to drive drunk, just don't combine them!"
888307,fishing n autograph,2014-12-23 22:02:00,2540,I've had several friends and coworkers seriously injured by a drunk driver. I've also been rear ended by a drunk
887823,Big Cliff,2014-12-20 12:17:00,6899,"With the Holidays upon us I would like to share a personal experience with my friends about drinking and driving.As you may know some of us have been known to have brushes with the authorities from time to time on the way home after a ""social session"" out with friends.Well, two days ago I was out for an evening with friends and had several beers followed by some rather nice Blanton's Bourbon. Feeling jolly, I still had the sense to know that I may be slightly over the limit. That's when I did something that I've never done before -- I took a cab home.Sure enough on the way home there was a police road block, but since it was a cab they waved it past. I arrived home safely without incident.This was a real surprise as I had never driven a cab before. I don't know where I got it, and now that it's in my garage, I don't know what to do with it.  "

888000,Entropy,2014-12-21 17:02:00,747,"Thanks for doing that.  I don't have a problem following a drunk while on the phone with the cops, and even stop to see if they are OK, after they ditch their vehicle.  I have spent some time in court, ensuring they don't kill myself or my family the next time they do something stupid.One guy is currently spending his weekends in Lindsay, and has no hope of getting a license again.  Be good out there.Entropy  "
888133,ch312,2014-12-22 16:23:00,1590,"I wish everyone made that choice.  Too many impaireds on the road, don't get tired catching them.  What punishment would a first time offender receive if they're driving drunk and injure someone? What about if someone is killed?  On average, are drunks typically let off too easy or are the courts hard on drunks?"
