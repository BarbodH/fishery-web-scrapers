I remember a little while ago a few board members talking about obstacle course races. Which ones did you like? Which ones are you doing again and which ones are you looking forward to?  Last year I got my spartan trifecta which was cool and I'll be looking to get a double trifecta this year. (The more you get, the bigger the medal. My buddies double medal last year was massive)  Also heard of a fun little 5k called 'prison break' where you run, do obstacles and avoid 'police' who try to steal your flags (a la flag football) to throw you back in jail."
