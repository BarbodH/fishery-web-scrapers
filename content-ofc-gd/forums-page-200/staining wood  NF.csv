887602,mistaredone,2014-12-19 01:33:00,913,I built my 2 year old a bunk bed play house out of pine and used a wood conditioner and stain. It's been a week and the smell is still pretty strong. Is it safe for my boy to sleep in his bed with the odour?
887604,workwear,2014-12-19 01:40:00,592,unfortunately the off gases will be in the room for quite awhile  what type of stain did you use...alcohol based or oil based
887605,mistaredone,2014-12-19 01:45:00,913,Oil base I think. Mini wax brand stain and conditioner
887629,Freshtrax,2014-12-19 04:43:00,2215,It might smell but in my opinion won't hurt anyone.   Leave the bedroom door open.
887652,aplumma,2014-12-19 12:30:00,6896,I checked with my Pops who is a wood worker and he recommended that you raise the temperature (5-10 degrees F) in the room to help flash off the oil as well as create a breeze in the room. Keep the door closed and open the window enough to get the fumes out for 8-10 hours if you can. The oil may make them cough or their throats feel slightly scratchy but it will not cause any real health issues.   Art
887718,captpierre,2014-12-19 17:33:00,2521,You aren't going to finish with a water based varethane?
887757,mistaredone,2014-12-19 22:18:00,913,"Thanks for all the replies.  As for the varethane, I'm not a fan of the glossy look on wood. I opted not to keep the wood looking raw."
887758,mistaredone,2014-12-19 22:19:00,913,I'm going to put a few heaters and a dehumidifier in the room and open the window for the day
887837,captpierre,2014-12-20 15:05:00,2521,"Varethane comes in satin.  Only slightly shiney Will need 3-4 coats. Dries in an hour. Very tough. Protects from spills, oils from fingers etc. used it a lot. Can also use oils like tung oil or wax  polish ."
