All the best to you and yours over the holidays,  Mike Hey Mike, we had put stuff on the back burner this summer and fall as we were in negotiations to buy into a fly in fishing lodge, unfortunately the deal has fallen through as of a few weeks ago.  We will be doing a relaunch in the new year with a new kind of format and shorter release clips. We have dozens of hours of footage in the bank which is good, and hopefully get them into post production soon. Just need to find some sponsorship $$$$ LOL. All the best to you too over the holidays!!  Looks like you have an awesome 2015 ahead of you!!"
