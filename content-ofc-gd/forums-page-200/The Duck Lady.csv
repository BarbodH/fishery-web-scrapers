887615,mike rousseau,2014-12-19 03:06:00,4661,Negligence pretty much sums it up...  She did something incredibly stupid by stopping in the fast lane of a highway to save a few ducks... And people died...  I'm guessing if they had of survived they would have been charged as well...  Both parties in the wrong...
887617,lookinforwalleye,2014-12-19 03:42:00,4399,2 counts of criminal negligence causing death...2 count of dangerous driving causing death and she gets 90 days on weekends bloody ridiculous!!!! I can't even contemplate how stupid one would have to be to stop their car in the left lane of a highway! And as far as the 10 year driving ban goes it's not long enough!!!
887622,DRIFTER_016,2014-12-19 04:05:00,10439,"But a car in front of the bike was able to avoid her, why didn't the guy on the bike?  Because the guy on the bike can't see through the car in front of him to see the stopped duck woman. That car swerved out of the way and there was not enough time for the bike dude to react and do the same.  Same kind of thing happened to a buddy of mine in the 90's on HWY 10 South of the QEW. Taxi driver in front, then tow truck and finally my buddy in a Jetta. Taxi guy slams on the brakes and stops to answer his phone, tow truck swerves to miss stupid taxi guy and my buddy rear ends taxi. Taxi guy was charged. My buddy was not."

Then he's way too close to the car.   You shouldn't have any issues seeing around the car in front of you, especially if you're on a bike."
887633,northernpike56,2014-12-19 05:16:00,717,"I'm pretty sure she stopped her car IN the passing lane, and even though I don't ride, I have some friends that do ride and they say that four wheels are more maneuverable than two when sudden reactions are needed. The car that was able to swerve out of the way, was not able to stop, so how would the motorcycle be able to outmaneuver it?"
887649,lew,2014-12-19 12:20:00,12766,"If a car stops and you either hit him or have to swerve to miss him your following far too close, driving too fast, or your not paying attention to what your doing."
887676,lookinforwalleye,2014-12-19 15:02:00,4399,True enough but given the circumstance of the moving car a head of the biker shielding his line of sight somewhat and the fact that this absolute moron stopped her vehicle in the passing lane of a multi-lane highway....the guy was probably a tad surprised!!! Yes the guy was driving too fast but that in it`s self should not have meant a death sentence for two people...accidents happen everyday and people die but this IMHO was not a accident this moron committed a criminal act that caused the death of two people!!!
887677,BillM,2014-12-19 15:06:00,17367,"Surprises happen when you drive, paying attention is important."

887685,BillM,2014-12-19 15:53:00,17367,The only thing they are going to appeal is the 10 year driving ban.
887688,Terry,2014-12-19 16:02:00,14456,that is what I heard too
887725,SirCranksalot,2014-12-19 18:13:00,3291,I thought it must be right---it was in the paper!!!!!
887752,Dara,2014-12-19 21:31:00,3052,"See, the guy on the bike didn't hit the car he was following...if it had stopped, he would have too...it jumped out of the way of something dead stopped in front...2 people dead for a duck  I had to jump out of the way of a ladder that fell off of a morons van on the highway once, the guy behind me hit it, if it was a bike behind me there would have been a fatality"
887753,davey buoy,2014-12-19 21:47:00,5505,"All I was ever told is you have to be in control of your vehicle at all times.Meaning you hit someone,you are at fault. Sure a strange circumstance here I must say.Right or wrong what she did,as many have mentioned you still have to be in control of your own vehicle."
887766,wkrp,2014-12-19 23:32:00,656,This just proves that a human life isnt worth a flying duck.
888263,moxie,2014-12-23 15:24:00,1566,"Excuse me ma'am, contrary to what you might believe or what others may have told you, your actions directly cost two people their lives and the mere fact you are appealing the sentence because you feel you have done no wrong proves beyond a shadow of a doubt you are in fact an idiot. Drop the appeal, serve your time and shut up."
887567,BillM,2014-12-19 00:31:00,17367,"Because if you just plowed right into a deer at 120 kph you'd probably be dead too, if you mow over a couple ducks at 120 the worst possible thing that could happen is you need a new bumper. No humans killed  You're missing his point..  His point is, if a car is stopped for a deer and you plow into the back of it...  You get charged.  If you plow into the back of a car that stopped for a few ducks, what's the difference here?   The reason for that person stopping doesn't make any difference.  You've still gotta be paying attention."

887570,Cookslav,2014-12-19 00:37:00,1457,"Gotta say if my wife stopped for a cat... And some one hit her from behind and died I wouldn't be crucifying her and thinking she's deserving of punishment.  She tried to avoid hitting ""somthing"" Doesn't matter if its a big 'ol tree branch....  The driver who hit her was not paying attention. I can totally see her appealing and winning that apeal unless there is somthing I'm missing here?"
887573,Terry,2014-12-19 00:40:00,14456,"she did not stop to avoid ducks or deer  she stop on the highway because she saw ducks on the side of the road and thought to herself, I will block traffic and pick up the ducks  and take them home..  it is 100% against the law to stop on the highway. if you hit a deer and end up stopped on the highway is one thing, a car accident ahead  but not some random wild life on the side of the road. her action was the major reason for the accident and would be charged, the guy on the bike could be also charged but would only be a contributing factor  and is often not charged"
887574,BillM,2014-12-19 00:43:00,17367,"But a car in front of the bike was able to avoid her, why didn't the guy on the bike?"

887577,Cookslav,2014-12-19 00:50:00,1457,"Ok so she stopped on the ""side"" of the road? How'd she get hit??? Was she still in the lane, or did the bike Drive on the shoulder?"
887578,SirCranksalot,2014-12-19 00:50:00,3291,"People grieve and deal with tragedy in different ways. For you to pass judgment on what you THINK others are feeling would be speculation on your part.  Well, she's appealing the verdict!! I rest my case!"

887581,Terry,2014-12-19 00:52:00,14456,"she saw her and swerved without signaling or looking , she did not have time to stop the driver of the bike , was either not a quick minded  as her or just took longer to realize she was stopped or there was a vehicle beside him or he just was not as luckly  I have come up on a stopped car and it took my brain way too long  to realize the car was stopped first I thought thought this car is going a lot slower then me, slow down a bit,, then it was holy crap it's stopped hit the brakes  and I first saw it 40 car lengths away... the brain does not expect to see a car on a busy highway stopped for no reason"
887582,bare foot wader,2014-12-19 00:52:00,1354,"I'm not an expert rider, but my time riding a motorcycle vs a car/truck, sudden high speed manuevers felt MUCH more safe in a 4 wheeled vehicle vs a bike  she didn't just stop, she parked on the highway without her hazard lights on...if she had her lights on that very well might have provided enough reaction time  I was coming down a highway this summer and there were tourists taking pictures, no hazard lights flashing, it took me an extra second or two to realize what was going on, those couple of seconds make a big difference"
887584,Terry,2014-12-19 00:54:00,14456," Well, she's appealing the verdict!! I rest my case! no she is not...unless they changed her mind minutes ago  she had said she excepts the verdict and the 90 days but is appealing the 10 year ban"
887585,BillM,2014-12-19 00:56:00,17367,  CARE AND CONTROL ON BOTH PARTIES HERE IMO  Agreed 100%.

887590,glen,2014-12-19 01:05:00,2641,You ever get rear ended while stopped at a light or a sign?
887591,Cookslav,2014-12-19 01:07:00,1457,Ya...I think there is a bit on both sides here the more I read into it.  She stopped on the side of the road which by most standards would be fine. But she had no hazzard lights on...thats her mistake  The motorcylce was also doing 129km hour....  I have to agree
887592,SirCranksalot,2014-12-19 01:07:00,3291,"no she is not...unless they changed her mind minutes ago  she had said she excepts the verdict and the 90 days but is appealing the 10 year ban  ""Labelle has already indicated he is appealing the conviction."" the 'bottom line' from that article."
887593,Cookslav,2014-12-19 01:09:00,1457,if only the motor cycle had snow tires non of this would have happend
887594,glen,2014-12-19 01:09:00,2641,On the side? I thought she stopped in the lane. Should be able to stop for ducks all day on the side.
887595,Terry,2014-12-19 01:10:00,14456,people do  even with all the signs telling people to stop like a cross road and stop signs and brake lights coming on you brain is trained to recognize these signs
887596,Terry,2014-12-19 01:10:00,14456,no she was in the lane
887598,Cookslav,2014-12-19 01:21:00,1457,"The woman had stopped her car in the left-hand lane of a provincial highway in Candiac, south of Montreal, to help the ducks cross the road....  ya its dumb, but...the girl got out of the car, tried to catch the ducks...time passed...cars passed... Then wham the bike hit... Long story made short, she's at fault....but the guy riding the bike doing 129km on a 90km zone was also not paying attention.  Had the car broken down and been there it would have had the same result. the only difference is she should not have stopped vs a break down which seh could not control"
887614,manitoubass2,2014-12-19 02:54:00,11391,oh gawd OFC is passing more legislation?

887497,Terry,2014-12-18 19:56:00,14456,I think 90 days served on weekends is too light  10 years of no driving is a lot
887498,lew,2014-12-18 19:57:00,12766,That was a sad case all around.  I can see the jail time and even the community service but don't really know if the added 10 year driving suspension is really necessary.  I dunno...
887500,Dara,2014-12-18 19:59:00,3052,I think the ten years is totally proper . She said she would do it all over again from what I remember....correct me if I am wrong
887504,BillM,2014-12-18 20:11:00,17367,I think the ten years is totally proper . She said she would do it all over again from what I remember....correct me if I am wrong  She said she'd do what all over again?  Certainly not trying to help a few ducks knowing what happened as the result of it.
887506,Dara,2014-12-18 20:41:00,3052, She said she'd do what all over again?  Certainly not trying to help a few ducks knowing what happened as the result of it.    Not a hundred percent sure but I kinda remember hearing that...no matter though. There was a lot of talk about it here earlier so I thought I would post up the results.
887511,Spiel,2014-12-18 21:21:00,9065,"Given the severity of her actions and what I would call a more than fair (extremely light sentence) she still feel's it unjust and is appealing the conviction.  I think she should accept the decision, serve it accordingly and shut her pie hole! If she appeals I hope they hand her a more severe sentence.  Appealing would to me suggest she is without remorse."
887512,craigdritchie,2014-12-18 21:28:00,1586,"I think it's completely inappropriate.  If traffic had been stopped because of an accident, the guy on the bike would still have hit and would have still killed his daughter. The accident is the result of the motorcyclist not being in control of his vehicle, simple as that."
887514,Spiel,2014-12-18 21:38:00,9065,"He would not have hit her Craig if she had not have stopped for the ducks, a violation in itself. Is he (the motorcycle driver) at fault, tough call but he would not have collided with her had she not stopped for the ducks.  I still say she should serve the sentence graciously and be grateful it was not more severe."
887515,outllaw,2014-12-18 21:41:00,1232,well if it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck.... still can not believe that happened she should never drive again in my opinion. sorry but people come first
887517,kuhaman,2014-12-18 21:46:00,503,well if it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck.... still can not believe that happened she should never drive again in my opinion. sorry but people come first I agree with you 100%

She'll never be the same and is not a threat to society. I believe her conscience will impose more of a sentence than anything the courts can. I wish her well."
887535,Terry,2014-12-18 23:20:00,14456,"problem is and even the judge said , she keeps saying she felt she did nothing wrong and she would do it again you can't fix stupid so ban them"
887536,Mister G,2014-12-18 23:23:00,1429,The 10 year no driving is FAR too much. Murders get less for intended acts. We should not put barriers in front of her making a living........we have way too may of them folks already.

I still say she should serve the sentence graciously and be grateful it was not more severe.  I agree she should serve her time graciously. And I will concede that stopping on a highway was very much a rookie mistake. But at the end of the day, the guy on the bike must bear some responsibility too. He has to be in control of his vehicle, and clearly, that was not the case. Otherwise, he would not have hit her vehicle.  Sorry Chris, you and I may need to agree to disagree on this one. I do believe both parties share responsibility for this accident."

I think all of us have seen people do dumb things like tailgaiting or weaving on the 401, but for someone to be so stupid that they stop their car in the passing lane is just ridiculous. I'm only 18 but this was one of the very few news stories I heard that really upset me. I can't imagine what it would be like to just watch your family die literally right infront of you."

887563,Cookslav,2014-12-19 00:25:00,1457,"mmm...Ok I'll ask the question even though maybe I'll get smacked lol...  So if I rear end you when you hit the brakes to avoid ""insert here"" (car, kid, cow, deer) And I hit you, I am usually charged with following to close.  But if rear end you when you hit the breaks for a duck...you get charged?  I think its sad someone lost their lives over this, and I think its incredibly stupid to stop for Ducks...but What it is the difference between stopping for a duck and a deer??? Legally speaking?  Am I missing part of the story?"
