Hi Dave. You could get away with that to a certain extent with a rear driven, front engine vehicle. Most of the weight is forward biased and that weight is on the front tires which creates traction for braking and steering. Still is best to put all 4 winters on though."

Many reputable tire shops will refuse to install 2 snows only. They know the risk. Lets say you have two top notch winter tires on the front of your front drive car. You are cruising along in a couple inches of snow or ice covered road. It feels real good cause the tires are working as they should.

Also Food for thought ...all weather radials vs all season radials...big difference. That youtube video featured a standard all season radial. All weather radials have a more aggressive tread pattern. and based on our southern ontario winters...i think they are more applicable IMO  There are down sides to snow tires to...they are not the miracle tire you might think. Snow tires have a more open tread pattern that bites down into snow better and then allows the snow to be thrown out of the groove. The pattern typically is not so optimized for channeling away water as with an all season tire. At low speeds the differences in water channeling are not significant. However, because of the open pattern, there is less rubber surface area to contact the road with snow tires. This can make for longer stopping distances in rain.  If your in snow...heavy set snow, yep winter snow tires are gonna be the choice.

There is simply no comparison between all seasons and winter tires. On winters, the tire compound remains pliable at temperatures below 7C and has more traction with the road. The lugs are also designed to clear slush and snow. If you haven't tried them, you really don't know just how much of a difference they make. I used to drive an Acura Integra with a set of Michelin X-Ice snows on it, and that vehicle was absolutely incredible in the winter. I remember coming home from ice fishing in a severe blizzard once and passing hundreds of SUV's and trucks and other vehicles on the 400 because they were sliding all over the place or were already stuck.  It is my opinion that you won't change the majority of people's poor driving habits, but through law you can force their hand to change their equipment for the greater good of all. This will reduce the amount of accidents and injuries as well as reducing gridlock issues by vehicles getting stuck or not being to drive up even small hills. The data from Quebec certainly supports this.  I would also  be fine with the German system of no snows no insurance coverage during the winter season.  It seems like a big initial expense, but really it is not when you factor in the wear and tear savings to your all seasons/summer tires.  I get that people don't like being told that they have to spend money - but when public safety is the main issue than it really should be a no brainer. And many people simply don't know just how good snows even are so they would fight against it uninformed. Maybe the government could give a significant tax write-off for the first five years that the law is passed to soften the initial blow."

When jet skis first came out it was just ridiculous out there. You will never get rid off all the bad ones.  Improving their equipment by mandating snows - which are superior equipment below 7C - makes a change, and improves the saftey of driving in winter conditions. Not to mention reducing gridlock and all the frustrations and economic impact caused by it."

So much for legislation, making people put snow tires on; if people are allowed to do that. A yearly safety would make more sense to me; because the people that are willing to drive on worn out ties; are likely not much into maintenance and only have their vehicle checked, if there's a large enough issue stopping them from driving the car at all. I've always wondered how many of the 401 crossover crashes that we use to hear about (before the wall went up); wasn't because a tie rod end or some other steering or brake item had failed and they couldn't steer or brake the car?

If you suck at driving, you suck at driving, what tires you have aren't going to make a lick of a difference.   I call them False hope tires, learn to drive. Been driving since a kid and learned to slow down when it's slippery I wonder how many accidents have happened since they brought out those winter tires, great I have winter tires now I can go faster. It's like I have 4 wheel drive I won't get stuck, BULL! I have a F150 Crew 4X4 and I'm going out and pay $2000.00 for a set of tires that I only need for a couple days and in five years they must go in the garbage because they are out of date.

Oddly enough, every winter there is a long and somewhat steep hill in Brantford that people get stuck on after every decent snowfall and I have zero issues going up the hill in my Ram in 2wd with all season tires and no weight in the back. This is where driving skill comes into play.   With over drive off simply approach the hill at a steady speed and maintain that speed, or even gradually slow as you're climbing, so your tires don't break loose. Do not apply more throttle while climbing to maintain or gain speed, change lanes, or think about touching your brakes and you'll climb the hill no problem. You want to climb the hill with the vehicle shifting as little as possible.  Going down? Apply the brakes at the top of the hill and maintain steady pressure to prevent sliding.    As for shorter stopping distances with winter tires, you can have the same effect with all seasons by driving according to conditions (slower), keeping proper space between vehicles, and braking much earlier than you would in the summer."

Most often you won't be, and will have to try and maneuver safely around those spinning their wheels on the hills.  As I said before, I don't think they should be mandatory by any stretch of the imagination.  Another guy here said that anyone who says winter tires are no better, and that it's all driving skill have likely never had a set.  I'd say he is dead on correct.  Winter tires aren't intended to allow you to drive faster, or outside of what conditions warrant.  They are there to provide traction with the road.  If a driver wants to kid themselves into believing winter tires are just a placebo, thats alright.  But they are missing the point of the matter.  Winter tires just make safe drivers safer!

886820,John Bacon,2014-12-15 19:47:00,3277," But what about the days when the roads aren't dry John ??  Just be on any road when there's a decent snowfall and cars are slipping & sliding all over the place and can't get up even smallish hills and they've got fuming drivers lined up behind them.  As I said earlier, there's absolutely NOTHING worse than being fully equipped for winter driving but you can't go anywhere because of all the drivers that say they don't need winter tires.  On those days it will definitely be better to have winter tires.  But it is not practical to change the tires on a day by day basis.  I am not convinced that it makes sense legislate the tires that may only beneficial for two or three days in the winter.  There will still be people who struggle to drive even with winter tires.  And it only takes one person to mess things up.  There will still be issues driving on snow days even if winter tires are required."

I don't see people driving with 4 spare wheels and tires to get down south and back and stopping and changing them when driving conditions change. For anyone that has made that trip you know that in 24 hours conditions can go from ice and snow to road temps over 100F.

I was an apprentice mechanic then and guess what job I had; go change the tires go change the tires. LOL  Then when the radial all-season came out (mid 70's) we were all told, (by the tire manufacturers) there's no need for a snow tire; run these all year round. Now 40 some odd years later we need snow/winter tires again? Yes winter tires do make a difference in traction, there's no doubt about it; but do we really need them here in SW Ontario, I don't know? The one thing that is for sure; it has been a great marketing scheme, by the tire manufacturers too get people on board with buying them. I sold close to $20 grand worth of snows/winter tires in the month of November; so I say yea bring it on. LOL If they do bring in mandatory winter tire; the people who can't or don't want to afford two sets; will buy the cheapest tire that has the snowflake rating and run them all year. After the first season these snows won't be worth crap for the next winter; but they'll be legal.  Dan."

X2  Never believed in them, never needed them, put a set on Sue's car for her a couple of years ago and couldn't believe the difference. We now have winter tires for both our cars and would never do without them again!!!  Better stopping better starting, doesn't make us more careless, just lets us adjust more quickly for the others that don't have them or don't know how to drive on bad roads.  I don't care if they are mandated or not, I use them anyway!"
886588,Old Ironmaker,2014-12-14 19:42:00,8243,"No. When we got hit last week I was driving along in 4 wheel in my pickup with my knobby winter tires on clean blacktop when I hit a foot or so patch of drifted snow on the 80KPH road. Just missed the ditch. I was going too fast, simple as that."
886589,John Bacon,2014-12-14 19:50:00,3277,It may make sense in northern Ontario.  But in southern Ontario we often have dry roads and warm temperatures in mid winter.
886590,dave524,2014-12-14 19:52:00,4508,"We don't get a lot of snow here, bought a snowblower when I retired in 08, never used it one winter and maybe 5 times last year , that was the most. I just don't go out when the roads are bad. Not an option for most but I would be really pisssst if I had to put them on the Jeep , it does OK for what we get with the Goodyear's Wranglers on it. I would probably get them if I lived in a snow belt and had to go out every day."
886593,lew,2014-12-14 20:10:00,12766,"It may make sense in northern Ontario.  But in southern Ontario we often have dry roads and warm temperatures in mid winter.  But what about the days when the roads aren't dry John ??  Just be on any road when there's a decent snowfall and cars are slipping & sliding all over the place and can't get up even smallish hills and they've got fuming drivers lined up behind them.  As I said earlier, there's absolutely NOTHING worse than being fully equipped for winter driving but you can't go anywhere because of all the drivers that say they don't need winter tires."
886598,Spiel,2014-12-14 20:30:00,9065,"I have a complete set of 4 winter tires on rims for 3 separate vehicles (mine and my daughters), several years ago I had never driven with snows. The difference is night and day, if you believe differently you are not as informed of the difference between ""all season"" and ""winter tires"" as you should be.  The life lost because of a poor and uniformed decision could be one of your own family members or even yourself.  Mandated, slippery slope but I will give my daughters every advantage available, cost is not a factor!"
886614,Burtess,2014-12-14 22:15:00,901,"Yup as said above if you don't think there is a difference then you obviously have never driven a season on winter tires.  I never used them until my previous car ('04 Buick LeSabre).  Slapped a set of X-Ice on it and I could drive around (literally) all wheel drive SUV's that still had all seasons on, it amazed me.  I drive around 70,000Km per year.  Just got a set of rims and Nordics for the van the wife and daughter drive.  $900 and change but it is much worth it if it prevents an accident.  I think it would be great to see it mandated as in Quebec.  Burt"

886624,glen,2014-12-14 23:06:00,2641,I have all weather hankooks on my car.  Winter rated but rated for year round use.  No changing tires.  No extra rims. If you drive less then 15000km a year there great.

We can't legislate ""bad drivers"" that's already a given and proven! The incompetency with the MTO and licensing is abysmal at best!  But we can legislate the incompetents with better tools for the job.  Lord knows I value my life, my children's lives and yours as well along with your families.  It's a proven fact that all season radial tires are not designed to perform in temps much below ..... brrrrr, cold!"

886640,glen,2014-12-14 23:48:00,2641,Guess no one saw my post.
886536,LostAnotherOne,2014-12-14 17:18:00,956,"So guys what do you think.  Should they or shouldn't they.  Studies have shown that winter tires do allow you to stop earlier, but do you think every car should have them on in winter time in Ontario.  My opinion is that it's not the tire it's the driver.  I'm 100% sure that one day the minister of transportation will say it's time to have them on and you will have no choice but to have them on.  I would just feel sorry for those families that are living pay cheque to pay cheque where they will have to dish out X amount of dollars for tires."
886538,Sinker,2014-12-14 17:26:00,8692,"I don't think it should be mandated, we have enough stupid laws as it is, but I do recommend them, and swear by running dedicated winter tires. The initial cost sucks, but they pay for themselves over time......by saving your all seasons. My car is BRUTAL in snow with all seasons. Dangerous. Put the snows on and it goes anywhere I point it.  S."
886539,Raf,2014-12-14 17:28:00,3495,if your address is north of 7 i would say yes.  the snowfall on thursday was a joke in terms of amount  yet i wasn't laughing when the guy ahead of me couldn't climb a minor grade.  the extra cost is offset by the fact that your tires will now last twice as long (ok snows typically wear quicker but you get the gist) and most insurers will discount your policy 5-10% if you use them.
886540,cram,2014-12-14 17:34:00,1733,"Mandatory on the hwy, otherwise not."
886541,lew,2014-12-14 17:40:00,12766,"I'm another one that always has dedicated winter tires plus 4X4 for the snowy months and absolutely hate getting stuck behind someone who doesn't have them.  There's plenty of folks though that just don't bother to drive in nasty weather and because of that I don't really think they should be mandatory. My dad was a good example as he lived in Toronto where the roads get cleared relatively fast and he just didn't bother with winter tires in his later years and would just wait till the roads were clear.  On the other hand, I had to go down to Peterboro last week when we got around 4-5"" of snow and I saw a couple folks who had absolutely NO idea how to get around in that bit of white stuff and should have been riding the bus."
886542,Terry,2014-12-14 17:41:00,14456,"my work truck has winter tires, and I got stuck 6 times, I just added 200 lbs to see if that helps  my own truck does not have winter tires and was fine"
886548,wkrp,2014-12-14 18:15:00,656,I would like to see  an insurance rebate if you use them .
886550,cram,2014-12-14 18:18:00,1733,I would like to see an insurance rebate if you use them . I bet your insurance company already does this.
886551,Freshtrax,2014-12-14 18:20:00,2215,We're already living in a nanny state.   I don't want  the government to make my tire decision for me too.   ( I do have sever mud and snow rated tires on my truck).
886558,lew,2014-12-14 18:27:00,12766,Winter tires have been mandatory in Quebec for a few years now and they have to be used between certain dates although I don't recall what they are.  Wonder if winter accident rates have changed since the new law was introduced ??
886559,Acountdeleted,2014-12-14 18:29:00,2562,"I wouldn't mind the government nannying us if we were rewarded for it. I'll put winter tires on my car if I can tax write off half/all of it.  The government keeps telling me not to smoke or drink because I'll go to the hospital at a younger age and spend more tax dollars. Ok fine, I don't. But then how about the government subsidize my gym membership so that I can keep fit and stay out of the hospitals for longer? I can't understand why it only works one way."
886560,misfish,2014-12-14 18:30:00,29133,Heres what I heard on the radio this morning.   Two separate driving tests. Summer and winter.  I can understand this.

886563,c10,2014-12-14 18:41:00,131,"After using winter tires I think they should be mandatory, I can tell when its snowing out who has them and who doesn't.  but like some of the other guys said.  Where will it end then? Do I need to have a government sticker to validate my mandatory winter tires annually after? lol (reminds me of that South Park episode on the TSA- toilet safety administration one lol) Interesting though, I would like to see the Quebec stats though, maybe the amount of accidents has dropped drastically.  I mean if it comes down to safety, at the end of the day if it saves lives I am in hands down. Well no, but I know so many people who got their license in the summer, then totaled their cars their first winter because they were stupid, I think its an interesting idea Brian.  but maybe you should be required to have a minimum I.Q instead? ahahaha"
886564,kickingfrog,2014-12-14 18:45:00,8333,"I am a big fan of winter tires. Both of our vehicles have 2 sets of wheels/tires.  It's easy to switch them and over the lifespan of the tires it doesn't cost very much at all considering what they do, so if it was law it would not impact me at all from that stand point.  However I'm on the fence as to whether or not it should be mandatory. I do feel that any accident in winter conditions with no-seasons should be charged heavily if the driver is at fault.  People drive like fools in all types of weather but in the winter it would be nice if the fools at least had better traction."
886566,misfish,2014-12-14 18:45:00,29133," Then what's next Brian, a test for daytime driving and another for driving after dark ??   LOL Lew  The problem is the ones that have all wheel drive and 4x4 and think they are super drivers.  Way to many new drivers that dont know how to drive in the winter. No disrespect here,but do places like India have winter roads? They come here and have never driven in snow. Like I said,no disrespect here. It is what it is."
886567,Joeytier,2014-12-14 18:47:00,3990,No kidding!  Really ridiculous idea.  I see enough people in Quebec with basically bald winter tires or 2wd trucks with zero weight in the back to know that mandating winter tires does not = safer roads.

886569,misfish,2014-12-14 18:54:00,29133,You would be surprised how many people cant see properly driving at night. Not saying there should be a test for that. Thats what doctors are for.
886570,kickingfrog,2014-12-14 18:54:00,8333,"Back in the day (When did I get old?) when I learned to drive there was no Sunday shopping. I got to practice a lot in the snowy mall parking lot.  Part of it is knowing how to keep from loosing traction, but the bigger part might be to know what to do once you have lost control.  I still ""test"" the car/myself a little when we get the first snow. I'll try in a safe place to slip a little around a corner to see how things are. I tried that with the brakes as well this week. I guess it was the first time my son had heard the ABS cause he didn't have a clue what was making the racket."

No one on the essa hill early morning. Slam the brakes on to see how the brakes work. Once with the traction mode on. Oh my god,not pretty. Turn it off. Slam again and then slow pumps.

886576,kickingfrog,2014-12-14 19:07:00,8333,"For the most part I had driven front wheel drive cars with manual trannys. When my wife wanted a small suv when we had kids it was all wheel drive and had some big nobly, noisy, tires. I though maybe they'd be ok in the snow. That year we had a snow storm in October before Thanksgiving. They were junk. I was ""safe"" for the most part because I was careful and learning the new vehicle but when I was stopped at a light I couldn't get going again up the hill.  For much of the province the summer/winter conditions vary too much not to take  advantage of the advancements that have been made in tires."
886578,crappieperchhunter,2014-12-14 19:17:00,2582,Never ran anything but all seasons and never had a problem. However  many people who's opinions I respect have told me that the difference is night and day..so I believe it is true.  I to would like to see data from Quebec as to whether it makes any real difference at the end of the day.  Bottom line for me is I will stick with all seasons because they have served me well for the driving I do. However if the government mandates it I have no problem switching over. Some have mentioned lower insurance rates if you run snows. This was something I did not know and will look into.
