She doesn't like touching the bait so the joke was always that I would take my time rigging her up to give the others in the boat a chance to catch something lol"

How many feet of ice up there? Heck it's December you must have been drilling holes for a few months now.  edit: I see the program here replaces s oh bee with buggers. To make a long story short, which is most difficult for me, the origin of that word is actually associated with the practice of sodomy dating back to the 13th century to disparage a group from Bulgaria that was in a war with the Pope and the Catholic church. That's funny, the word replacement not the 20,000 men women and children killed."

At least you got her to take it off, we are still working on my buddy's g/f and I dont think my grandmother is going to change now at 89...  lol, I never minded baiting the hook or taking the fish off when we had people out anyways because it usually means we are catching something, and that in turn usually results in a good time lol  If you liked that vid.

She was totally fine with baiting her own hook and taking off her own fish, but she had a 6th sense.  Their cottage was on the French. All of us guys would fish all of the far corners of the River, coming back later with an empty boat and freshly washed fishing lures. When we got back there would always be pike and walleye cooked and ready to eat on the table. And the conversation would always go the same way.  'Grandma, where did you get those fish? We ate it all last night' 'Oh, these? I caught them while you were out?' 'Where?!?' 'Just off the dock'.  Somehow she just knew. She would be sitting, watching tv or knitting and all of the sudden, she would get up, grab a fishing rod, not caring what was on it, throw a few casts off the dock and have something ready for dinner within 10-15 minutes. I'll never fully understand it, but that's what makes the story that much better."

It happens to me especially when fishing in waters that could produce a huge musky or pike.  That fish where when you first see it and you look in amazement.  When you get your hands on it you say to yourself that's a fish that needs to mounted on my wall.  Maybe I fantasize to much, but that's just me lol.  Anyways I haven't crossed paths with that fish yet.  A few weeks ago I caught my biggest musky which was a fat 44"" maybe 25lbs, but it's not that fish.  I always say that she's out there, but we haven't crossed paths.  So guys what's the fish you've always wanted to land and will land someday."

Now I don't even bother with trying to get some sleep. Why should I waste time tossing and turning and waking my wife that has to get up early to go to work so I sharpen lures and put a plan together for the Walleye assault on Erie or wherever we are heading? Plenty of time to sleep when your dead.  My bucket list fish next has to be Tarpon. Got my Musky in Nippissing (my first non Tiger Musky) this past October with Dan Columby, thanks again Danny, no sleep that night either. So Tarpon is next.  We go to Charlotte Harbor as often as we can and it is smack dab next to the best Tarpon waters in the world. Sportsmen come as far as Japan and Australia to fish them. I have tried but no luck yet. If it's in the budget and the season is open I want to split a charter soon. Anyone interested? I'll even take a small 50 pounder.  For here I would like to get one of the many Gar Pike I see all spring and early summer spawning along the shore here."

Ah, on second thought any trophy regardless of species is good for me, as long as they get to swim again.
