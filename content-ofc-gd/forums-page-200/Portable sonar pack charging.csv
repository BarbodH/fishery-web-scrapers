887690,mike rousseau,2014-12-19 16:05:00,4661,Quick question....  I need a charger for my small 12v battery for my humminbird portable pack...  How high of amps is safe for a battery like this...?  I found a 1 amp battery tender junior but it's $40... If I'm gunna spend that I might as well get a car charger with a 2a setting... But is that too high of amps for  these batteries...???  Thanks  Mike
887692,Terry,2014-12-19 16:10:00,14456,get the one amp  the 2 amp might work well but sometimes the higher amp chargers don't see the  small batteries as needing a charge until they are really low
887706,Sinker,2014-12-19 16:56:00,8692,I've been using my smart deep cycle battery charger on the 2A setting for about 5 or 6 years now on my gel battery. It works fine.  S.
887707,Terry,2014-12-19 16:58:00,14456,yeah so work great others don't like small batteries

887716,Fisherman,2014-12-19 17:28:00,7201,"Most batteries don't like being charged at more than C10, that being 10% of capacity.  Therefore, as most portable packs are run from 7 Amp batteries. they shouldn't be charged at more than .7 Amps or 700mA.  Get the right charger for the job."

887730,Fang,2014-12-19 18:50:00,1330,Another very good one is the Tecmate Optimate 4. I bought mine at Magnacharge when I picked up the bigger 15 A battery packs.

887739,mike rousseau,2014-12-19 20:18:00,4661,I picked up a Noco genius G750 smart charger...  $42.99...  750ma
