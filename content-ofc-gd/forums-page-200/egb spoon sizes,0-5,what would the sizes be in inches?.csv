887762,123chadder,2014-12-19 22:31:00,165,"hey there,im about to order some egb spoons,they come in sizes from 0-5 i believe,does anyone know the actual lengths of the sizes 0-5?"
887807,solopaddler,2014-12-20 03:51:00,8605,"Not sure on the length but if it's brook trout you're after the 1/4oz number two is what I use 90% of the time. On really big water I'll throw a #3. I have no use for the 0's and 1's. The 4, 5 and 6 are a different shape, totally different spoon. Those larger ones are good for lake trout."
887812,Joeytier,2014-12-20 06:18:00,3990,"Yep, 1/4 oz for brookies and the bigger ones are pretty dynamite for lakers."

Probably #4 and 5.  I have 7 fly in trips booked already for 2015, but won't be going back to Dayo. One of the trips is with White River Air though to Shekak Lake in July.      i will have to procure some of these egb spoons if Borger, and Joey endorse   .  For as long as I can remember, which is almost 40 years, the EGB spoons have been the gold standard when it comes to brook trout lures. My uncle started using them back in the sixties when no one had even heard of them before.  They're easy to get now as it seems more stores carry them and you can buy them online, but I can clearly remember the pre internet days when they were ultra scarce. If I stumbled onto some in the right colours at some obscure dusty old shop I always grabbed them up."
888030,Joeytier,2014-12-21 20:51:00,3990,I cant endorse the price!
888041,123chadder,2014-12-21 22:40:00,165,I cant endorse the price! till you use them....  i dont find them that expensive...$5.75-$7.50
888047,Joeytier,2014-12-21 23:07:00,3990,"Around here they're closer to ten bucks, for smaller sizes too"
