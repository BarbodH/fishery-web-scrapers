886826,northernpike56,2014-12-15 20:34:00,717,"Hi guys, my car (2008 BMW 335i) has been stalling a lot at slow speeds recently, and has a lot of trouble starting up, I get the code for a faulty crankshaft sensor on it. Does anyone know approximately how much this costs in parts/labour to fix? Just so I get a rough idea of what the repair bill will be...  Thanks, Matt."
886856,Freshtrax,2014-12-15 22:35:00,2215,Part is about 150.  1 hour labour.     It's pretty easy to do....literally 1 bolt. If it's 4wd it's a little trickier.

886860,irishfield,2014-12-15 22:41:00,26272,"I wonder about the ""two per vehicle"" it states though?"
886862,HTHM,2014-12-15 22:58:00,4082,Dual camshaft??
886864,irishfield,2014-12-15 23:20:00,26272,I may have pulled up the wrong thing in a hurry... looks like I did grab camshaft vs crankshaft..
886865,Burtess,2014-12-15 23:21:00,901,"Note OP said crankshaft....... I am assuming camshaft sensor is a different part?  I once had a camshaft sensor error code and it was the GM mechanic that banged it loose when he was ""fixing"" something else lol....  Burt"
886866,Burtess,2014-12-15 23:22:00,901,Lol.... one minute too late...
886867,Freshtrax,2014-12-15 23:23:00,2215,The camshaft ones are more of a pita. And more spendy.
886868,BillM,2014-12-15 23:24:00,17367,While you're replacing the sensor check the harness as well..
886871,bigbuck,2014-12-15 23:35:00,2449,Check out one or two of the bimmer forums out there. It may be an easy diy fix that could save you a couple hundred bbucks that you could spend on tackle......just saying.
886875,irishfield,2014-12-16 00:06:00,26272,It's just one bolt and a wire harness clip. All depends where it is and what you need to get to it. Heck with it being temperamental (in my history they just die = no start) it might just be a loose mounting bolt or chafed wire.
886899,Freshtrax,2014-12-16 02:02:00,2215,It's on the back of the block access is easiest from underneath.

887100,bigbuck,2014-12-16 20:40:00,2449,"I remember those SCs, they were a nice car back in the day. One of the first to go with platinum plugs. My eyes popped when I saw how much they cost as compared to regular Autolites."
887552,northernpike56,2014-12-19 00:01:00,717,"Thanks guys, new crank sensor and changed the oil at the same time. Codes cleared and she runs perfectly"
887610,Freshtrax,2014-12-19 02:42:00,2215,Nice. Did you d it yourself?
887634,northernpike56,2014-12-19 05:29:00,717,"Kind of, I had my uncles help with the tools and expertise LOL. We have done stuff like brakes and coolant flush together too, its pretty cool stuff"
887635,northernpike56,2014-12-19 05:35:00,717,"I have also done sparkplugs on an inline 4 engine and I'm going to change a clutch on a miata with a friend, just thought I'd throw that out there its pretty useful knowledge to have"
887636,Freshtrax,2014-12-19 05:37:00,2215,Way to go man!   Love helping people learn.
887637,Freshtrax,2014-12-19 05:38:00,2215,"Miata clutch will be a breeze.. 10 bolts and your done !   Fwd,  is a little more involved."
887638,northernpike56,2014-12-19 05:51:00,717,"oh yea for sure, I feel like its good knowledge to have as well as if you get really good at doing standard maintenance you will save so much money over your life, especially if you love cars lol. We figured miata would be the easiest because its rwd (which apparently is the simplest setup for a car) as well as the vehicle is so small and light. Miata's are a blast btw, I don't care what anyone says, they're hilarious to drive!! Thanks again for everyone's input here, this is exactly why I love forums"
