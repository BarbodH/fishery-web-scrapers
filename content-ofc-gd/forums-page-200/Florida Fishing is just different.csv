I've been trying for sharks off the beach for the past few days but today we went to do some backwater fishing. Caught next to nothing for 3 hours, then suggested we try fishing under a bridge, and we catch one basically every single cast! Just shows that you have to find the fish. Shark bait for the rest of my time here!  "
887626,Freshtrax,2014-12-19 04:32:00,2215,See everyone should reel leftie.   Doesn't make sense to change hands after hook set!  . Cool vid.
887628,PBenson,2014-12-19 04:36:00,154,I reel both but do prefer lefty. The rod I was using isn't mine. Completely agree though.
887934,captpierre,2014-12-21 01:10:00,2521,Nice. What are those?
887964,scuro2,2014-12-21 05:29:00,904,The fish in my avatar pic is a jack.  My guess is that you lucked on perfect conditions just as you went to the bridge.
887965,PBenson,2014-12-21 06:25:00,154,They fight very similar to small mouth bass IMO
888010,OhioFisherman,2014-12-21 18:02:00,6623,"I went to Florida in 2009, Largo near Tampa and the gulf coast. Just west of Largo was Indian Rocks Beach ( like 1 mile from where I stayed), the gulf on one side and some type of inland waterway on the other.  Call it your typical tourist trap? Miles of hotels, motels, beaches, motorbike and bike rentals places, gift shops and restaurants.  We went out to eat one evening, the seafood place had a deck-dock dining area that was on the inland waterway and overhung the water. One of the main attractions seemed to be watching the servers scrape the food scraps into the water and seeing schools of fish appear to eat them! LOL  I have no idea what type of fish they were, some were pretty darn big, those back waters, especially near a restaurant might not be a bad place to start fishing if you go there?"
888376,Rizzo,2014-12-24 03:18:00,4754,oh man I remember as a kid fishing for those things in the intracoastal. Once you found the school it would be literally nonstop til your yellow bucktail jig was destroyed or you got tired of catching them.
