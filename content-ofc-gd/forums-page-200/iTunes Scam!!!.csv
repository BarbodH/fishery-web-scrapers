At the bottom of the email it says click here to cancel...  When I did it brought me to a website that ""LOOKED"" like apple but was not... asking for all my information....  I did not... My visa has not been charged and it has been a week since the email...  Good old holiday spirit...  Mike"

He asked me to hit my ""control"" key, I told him it didn't work. He asked why and I said because he told me it was infected, I stuffed Kleenex into all the holes on the key board to prevent further spread. I then asked him if he could help me get the cup holder in my computer to stay open. I then called him a fraud, a leech and words I can't say here... It was fun! Just beware, Microsoft DOES NOT CALL YOU!!! Following this scum's instructions will give him control of your computer.  Have fun with them and the most hurtful thing you can do to them, is waste their time. Acting dumb as a rock to a guy stealing can be fun! HH"

Mike  Been getting a similar e-mail regularly from ""Apple""  requesting that I update my security information or my i-Tunes account will be locked  Bunch of scam artists looking for credit card info. Though I did forward on the e-mail and address of the sender to Apple to make them aware of the scam. I also asked how the scammers know I have an i-Tunes account??? I'm thinking security at Apple may not be all they claim it is? Haven't had a reply from Apple yet."

I received an email from CRA (revenue Canada) stating I was entitled to a further tax refund due to new information they had received.  Then they wanted my personal information such as social insurance #, email address & the amount of refund I was claiming.  Immediately I became suspicious.  If they're sending me a refund - wouldn't they already have my personal info?  Sure enough when I phoned CRA the guy at CRA told me they never send out emails such as the one I received.  Just a heads up guys!"

And sure enough it is an official looking government website...  It was asking me for all kinds of info... Including my credit cards and their pin numbers..  I knew right away as soon as I got the email it was a scam, but clicked anyeays to see how dumb these morons are.  I just hope those less technical ie seniors can see this for what it is.... A scam!"
