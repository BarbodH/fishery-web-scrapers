888118,mike rousseau,2014-12-22 14:30:00,4661,One year I found a mounted largemouth under the tree... Mounted on a piece of driftwood we found in our creek...  I caught the big bass in our boathouse on a micro tube.... I thought dad released it...  Probably the biggest Christmas surprise ice ever had...  20 years later it still looks beautiful
888126,manitoubass2,2014-12-22 15:32:00,11391," thats awesome!  In our house fishing gear is very common for gifts especially for me and my boys. last year my oldest boy, 11 at the time had saved money all year and much to my surprise it was for my lowrance fish finder. amazing gift and $300 is alot of money for an 11 year old. ill never sell it and i plan on fishing it as long as it lives.  that year I got him a curado and $1000 tackle box fully loaded. so he was stoked as much as i was.  problem is we now have everything we need lol  no fishing gear at all planned for this year."

Before that I fished with a hand line for carp, suckers and catfish or cut down a good length of a branch or a bamboo pole with a hook, line, sinker and a float..."
888132,fish_fishburn,2014-12-22 16:15:00,1311,When I was about 8 I wanted and got for Christmas a pair of Bobby Orr skates. They were pumpkin orange/yellow on the sides. I was beside myself when I ripped that present open. I actually thought they made me skate a lot faster because I had the coolest skates on my team.
888134,NAW,2014-12-22 16:36:00,4022,"Every year, my fishing/hunting partner do a small gift exchange.  That is the only fishing related gift I get.  Every year, its something different.  My favourite was a few years back, he made me a real slick gaff.  Which bounced off the quad later that season...."

888137,fishnsled,2014-12-22 16:54:00,3520,"Don't recall getting anything for Christmas that was fishing related as a kid.  There was a birthday gift one year of a new spinning rod and reel, still have them.  Best Christmas gift that was fishing related,  would be the gas auger my ex-wife bought me.  I've had it for close to 20 years and still runs like a champ! Spark plugs, gas and oil, sharpen up the blades and that has been it, awesome gift!"
888182,porkpie,2014-12-22 22:01:00,2521,"When I was a teenager I received a custom wrapped loomis float rod from my Dad.  Still fish it today, but only occasionally as the blank and the memories are irreplaceable."

888219,bigugli,2014-12-23 02:31:00,6138,"As a kid. we didn't get fishing gear at Christmas. That was the time for sticks, skates, pads, sleds.  My birthday was when I got most of my fishing gear"
888257,dave524,2014-12-23 12:54:00,4508,"At Christmas we didn't do fishing stuff as a kid, Christmas was a time for guns and ammo. My birthday was May 8th, it was a tradition to go trout fishing in Norfolk County, usually Big Creek for my birthday and I would get new stuff for the trip."
