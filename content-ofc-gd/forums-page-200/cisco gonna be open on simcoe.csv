This applies in most other areas of the province, but NOT on Lake Simcoe where the total possession limit of cisco is 2 (Sport Licence) and 1 (Conservation). Nicely Done!

887786,irishfield,2014-12-20 01:38:00,26272,"I brought home a  19"" Lake Herring the year Terry, Andy and I sledded out from my place onto GBay. Filleted, battered and deep fried like any other fish... and it tasted no different than a pickerel or pike done the same way."

887805,dhickey,2014-12-20 03:41:00,1038,Are they putting a size limit on them?? 11-14 inches are the only ones good for eating. Kinda like perch.
887819,Terry,2014-12-20 10:14:00,14456,no
887820,Big Cliff,2014-12-20 10:29:00,6899,"I have a hot smoker, cold smoker and a really good recipe for pickeled herring. Soooooooooo if any one wants to supply some, I'll do the hard part, you get half, I get half"
887842,gaspumper,2014-12-20 15:39:00,393,Is it worth pickling or smoking 2 herring being the possession limit is 2 .
887843,Fisherman,2014-12-20 15:50:00,7201,Sure it's worth it.
887859,ecmilley,2014-12-20 17:51:00,2163,home sunday afternoon ? Drop some specks off if  i get back at a decent time
887874,Big Cliff,2014-12-20 20:05:00,6899,Looking forward to it!
887654,ecmilley,2014-12-19 12:33:00,2163,Heard there opening herring so really any recipes on pickling out there. I know a neighbour that has a cold smoker coukd try that as well
887655,Terry,2014-12-19 12:38:00,14456,"2 fish limit,  is it worth pickling  2 ?"
887658,manitoubass2,2014-12-19 12:41:00,11391,pike bait  how big do they get on simcoe?
887659,BillM,2014-12-19 12:43:00,17367,Going to be a gong show out there this year (If we get any ice)
887671,Beavertail,2014-12-19 14:33:00,331,"Yup, although I always found Simcoe to be a gong show."
887672,Beavertail,2014-12-19 14:38:00,331,"I can picture it now...all the guys playing dumb keeping too many whities, claiming they thought were Cisco."
887673,crappieperchhunter,2014-12-19 14:46:00,2582,pike bait  how big do they get on simcoe? Most of the ones I get perch fishing are between 10-14 inches. Very annoying some days. You can't even get your bait through them to get to the perch on the bottom
887679,Locnar,2014-12-19 15:28:00,645,Is this for real?
887680,manitoubass2,2014-12-19 15:30:00,11391,Yeah bout the same size here. For some reason I thought they got bigger on Simcoe
887681,BillM,2014-12-19 15:34:00,17367,Is this for real?  Yes.
887686,Joeytier,2014-12-19 15:54:00,3990, Good news for the simcoe guys though.  I'll have to try pickling a fish or two this winter
887696,manitoubass2,2014-12-19 16:30:00,11391,I see. Thats probably where I heard about the monsters lol.
887713,Mike Pike,2014-12-19 17:25:00,1332,I heard that this was being considered buy the MNR but I couldn't find any official report that cisco season will reopen at any time specifically.  Does anyone have anything official?
887714,Terry,2014-12-19 17:26:00,14456,yeah hard copy 2015 regs are out
887715,BillM,2014-12-19 17:27:00,17367,"yeah hard copy 2015 regs are out  Yup, right on the cover no?"
887719,lookinforwalleye,2014-12-19 17:35:00,4399,Going to be a gong show out there this year (If we get any ice)  I have inside information......no ice this year!!!
887732,BillM,2014-12-19 19:12:00,17367, I have inside information......no ice this year!!!  You're getting coal in your stocking!  lol!
887733,Terry,2014-12-19 19:14:00,14456,walking skidooing atv or boat  we will be fishing for them on simcoe in the new year
887735,BillM,2014-12-19 19:17:00,17367,"I really wouldn't be upset and not being able to fish them through the ice, the boat is ready to go anytime"
887737,NAW,2014-12-19 19:34:00,4022,"I am interested in trying a Simcoe herring.  I've had Nippising herring before, but wasn't a big fan.  The ones on Simcoe are long and skinny compared to the fatties on Nip."
887745,jimmer,2014-12-19 20:48:00,2730,"They should leave them closed. They will get abused/overharvested whatever.. However, it might be a good way for the MNR to make extra $$$$."
887772,Mike Pike,2014-12-20 00:25:00,1332,"Thanks Terry.  That's why I couldn't find anything online yet.  Without knowing the limits and such until I get a hardcopy in my hands, at first blush, I think it's great news.  If the science says a harvest is ok now, then I'm all for it.  I remember back in the day, having a couple of Cisco mixed in with a cooler of perch to take home, clean(  arghhh ), and enjoy.  Nice to have those days back."
887773,misfish,2014-12-20 00:29:00,29133,"They should leave them closed. They will get abused/overharvested whatever.. However, it might be a good way for the MNR to make extra $$$$.   Over harvested?  2 LIMIT SPORT AND 1 LIMIT CON.  I think the biggest charges that will come from people not knowing the dif. Then again we will hear,didnt know the dif."
887774,Mike Pike,2014-12-20 00:35:00,1332,I remember they were considering an aggregate limit.  In other words:  2 whitefish..   or 2 herring..   or 1 whitefish and 1 herring.   This would eliminate the confusion between the two.  I'm guessing that's not the case?  Gotta get me a hardcopy of the regs!!!!!!!!
