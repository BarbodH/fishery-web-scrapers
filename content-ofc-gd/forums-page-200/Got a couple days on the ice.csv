I got out on a couple trout lakes and unfortunately for my brother, the days that fish were caught... were the ones where he had to work haha. The walks in and out were pretty rough on these lakes, plowing through 2 ft of snow, up and down hills and through downed trees.  The splake lake  The splake  The hill, the picture doesn't do it justice.  Rainbow lake  Another  Couple for the table  The wolves liked checking out my spots, on both lakes everytime I went back there was tracks. At this site, there must have been about 5 or 6.   We also went to the Sault, and snapped this photo of Lake Superior   It was friggin nice to step onto some ice and land some fish, now to wait for southern ontario to freeze up... doesn't look promising with this weather."
887286,NAW,2014-12-17 14:37:00,4022,Wicked report man!!  Pics never do hills any justice.  That one looked like a tough slug!  But well worth it eh!
887288,LucG,2014-12-17 14:38:00,779,Nice pics! I know oh to well about those dreadful hikes haha. Seems as if most of them were worth it tho!

887319,chris.brock,2014-12-17 15:53:00,4053,Sweet!  How much ice up there?
887365,Locnar,2014-12-17 20:24:00,645,There was about 7 inches of ice under a foot of snow. I'm thinking about driving up to the gooderham region to scout out some areas for the upcoming season. Maybe take a look at a river that's supposed to have browns in it... wonder if they're still in there and biting.
887381,TDunn,2014-12-17 21:45:00,680,"Nice! Fished the area a lot! Were the bow and splake lakes just north of nagagamisis lake? If so, deadly lakes. If your heading back up pm me, I can give you some info on some great laker and brookie lakes. Nice report!  TDunn"

887403,Locnar,2014-12-18 00:04:00,645,"TDunn, yeah those lakes were north of Nagagamisis. The rainbow lake was just north of it, and the splake lake was closer to HWY 11. I'll let you know if I'm heading back up.  Rainbows through the ice was a blast, wasn't expecting that size either. I was expecting more the size of the splake, but then it ran and just zipped a ton of line out. There was a couple that snapped my line pretty easily."
