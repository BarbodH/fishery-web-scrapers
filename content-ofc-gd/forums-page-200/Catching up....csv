886702,Cookslav,2014-12-15 02:46:00,1457,"Its been a while since I've been around and posting, and I have received a few ""where have you been"" PM's that reminded me of how much I love posting here  Long story made short...I've just been busy. 2014 was a year of absolute insanity for me in a great way though. I saw one of my best freinds get married, my brother got married as well, which meant 2 wedding parties, 2 Bachelor parties, 2 Stag and does and 2 receptions. At 38 years old I thought I was just about done with that stuff lol... Then to further eat away into my fishing time I took a new job which involved some schooling and certifications that took some time and prompted a bit of travel but thats all done. I've climbed another step on the latter and I'm happy to have taken on a Operations Manager position at one of the hotels with in my chain...an exciting time for me to be running my own place.  With that change came furthe fiscal opportunity, and I finally pulled the trigger on purchasing some land with on of my best freinds who happens to be a fellow board member Big Swede. We purchased 120 acres just north of Havelock on a sleepy remote access lake. Complete with a rustic log cabin and all the chattles one would need to live off the grid. With that purchase came a lot of work... It needed some TLC maintaining the road, launch, dock, roof etc...  I also moved my Trailer this spring to a new park close to sauble beach and built a deck, land scaped...and I built her a shed until...well...6 days lated a tornado took the shed and My BBQ....Found the shed about 45yards away.   It used to be Here LOL....    So....I iguess I still have some work due in the spring  Anyway, I was busy to say the least. So I do appologise for the silence, and lack of posting and here is my breif catch up... The 5 minute version!  My spring algonquin trip did happen, and we did catch fish, but not as many as usual. Weather sucked...lotta rain, water was cold....here are some pics Day one and two...we went fishless, but Day 3 we managed to get a feed of Splake.    Day 4's feed     Magic lure was a Panther martin ran shallow over boulder feilds and open water.         Cooking in the kitchen     Looking down the Lake     Chippawa Table we built in camp...always a must have     Manditory Campr fire shot....we kept it rocking all weekend. We saw everything from snow to a full on Thunderstorm, high winds and torrential down pours that weekend.     Ok so thats my usual algonquin trip in a less ""spec"" tacular fashion... Moving on lol...  Some highlights from the new Hunt camp we purchased. Water front veiw looking back.     Active bass      Kids catch too...right from the dock    I got out for some Muskie again this year And I managed a pretty decent musky again so I'm 2 for 2 on my June Musky trip as well.    My new toy to keep the road nice and flat...front end loader     Covered Porch for balmy nights, and composting crapper for those not wanting to make the midnight run for the out house....which comes in very handy as the kids are not a fan of leaving the cabin at night       Ok and whats a hunt camp with out some hunting pics....if your squeemish stop here  From this,     to this...     To this....     and finally.... (previously to being an Operations Manager...I was a Chef so this is my ""thing"")      Full circle of life there, and not a drop wasted. The hide is now a rug at the camp and every non-tender peice became ground venison or Sausage. I even gave the bones to the dogs for a job well done  Ok....so I think thats it? I'm caught up and will try not to store it all up at once any more. And I hope to work less and have a lot more time to fish in 2015 so here's hoping!    "

886926,Moosebunk,2014-12-16 04:03:00,3970,"Need extra thumbs for the thumbs up this report needs.  Congrats on acquiring the new camp, what a little home away from home that's gonna be for you and the buddies.  So the report has deer, skies, trout, kids, friends, Algonquin and a front-end loader... Gotta say that pretty much amounts to a whole pile of man-awesome. lol.  Tougher spring for most in the park this past year.  Just such a weird spring.  Ya did alright though and I'll look out for next years chapter too."
