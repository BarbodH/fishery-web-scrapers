But that aside I'd bet I recognize you before you would me."

Works out great as we have a party that night and it's on 56 in Binbrook so I can stop in the Creek for an hour or so then meet my lady at the Xmas party, perfect. If anyone from Hamilton wants at least a one way designated driver PM me, if I have 2 beers it's one over what I usually drink on a wild night on the town. I can't stay too long but unless you plan on closing the place I can drive you home after a few hours.  Look forward to it, again. Forgot last year to mark it down. Same goes for last months Stelco club meeting, again."

Now if I find my note I need to date them. Hit my noggin one too many times on a Stock shed bin door."
