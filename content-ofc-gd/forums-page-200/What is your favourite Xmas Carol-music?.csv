And then once and a while Uncle Sammy would be missing and my Noni told us he was off to college for 3 to 5.  It kind of got better in High School when I could be exposed to other families Christmas traditions. As an adult without kids I was bah humbug and if I had a rare Christmas off I would switch shifts with guys that did have young children. Around 9 PM Christmas Eve or day at around 1PM everyone would ask where you goin' you old Scroog? Off to put the furnaces ahead. Had the best lunches those shifts.  Favorite music now, Pavarotti's ""O Holy Night""."
