887395,misfish,2014-12-17 23:29:00,29133,I have been looking in that area for the past 4 weeks since I got the intel. No sightings yet. Deer and a cooper hawk.
887411,musky666,2014-12-18 01:04:00,126,Could have swore I saw a couple of them hanging out behind my facility in Newmarket last week- will try to confirm...
887412,BillM,2014-12-18 01:15:00,17367,"They'll gladly hang around pretty much anywhere there's a food source.  Although 9 times out of 10, I'll spot them on the ground, not perched up on a telephone pole, etc."
