1078362,crappieperchhunter,2022-01-28 14:40:00,2582,Hit Tim Hales with Cliff yesterday. Have not fished in a rental hut since the 80's. They have not changed much since then. Warm and comfortable huts lotsa pinhead minnows and no walking and dragging all my own gear out. Action was pretty steady for perch although yesterday the smaller ones visited more frequently than the bigger ones. Came home with 2 feeds for Debbe and I. Cliff did a little better than I did. However my favourite take away from the day was just hooking up with an old fishing buddy who I have not had face time with for far too long. Thx Cliff it was a great day.

It was really nice to have a chance to catch up and reminisce about some of our previous outings, we sure have created some fond memories.Â  The new blades for my electric filleting knife got a great work out, these ones are a little longer than the originals which I really liked. As discussed, we will be doing it again before the ice out. Oh, and I still think those ones that got off had to be at least 3 lbsðŸ˜‰"
