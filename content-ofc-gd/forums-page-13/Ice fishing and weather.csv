1078375,Big Cliff,2022-01-29 15:37:00,6899,"Cold front coming in, fishing is going to be slower, warm front coming in, the bite seems to improve. The amount of varation in the cold/warm seems to be in direct correlation to the change in the bite."

But if I’m keeping it 100% I’ve always done best on brighter days. if a storm is coming in it can be really good just like softwater. but I’ve found more consistent bites when it’s blue bird softwater, cloudy calm warm days are the juice"
1078408,Garnet,2022-02-01 09:44:00,2056,The steadier the weather the better the bite? On Simcoe the bite would normally get into a every 3 days it's very good. This Year that hasn't happen yet . And like always just go the days you have time.
1078409,Big Cliff,2022-02-01 10:42:00,6899,"Well, yesterday we had a warm up from extreme cold to a fairly mild day by comparison, the bite was amazing, we caught well over 100 fish."
