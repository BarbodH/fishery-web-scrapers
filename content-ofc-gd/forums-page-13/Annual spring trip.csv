Almost all of them to Rice Lake, Nipissing or Hay Bay and always very end of May or early June. In recent years, walleye fishing on these lakes has been disappointing so I'm looking for a new destination. Any recommendations would be greatly appreciated. Ideally something within 4-6 hours drive from Niagara. TIA"
1078052,huey graphite,2022-01-13 01:35:00,362,I would consider a different part of Rice Lake or Quinte but the slot size and possession limits on Nipissing are a deterrent. We don't keep alot but it would be nice to do a fish fry one night of our 3 night trip. When on Rice Lake we usually fished the southwest end between Hall Landing and Gores Landing.
1078054,Chuck Enwinde,2022-01-13 05:59:00,247,They changed the slot size on Nipissing this year.  Limit is still 2 but you shouldn't have a problem putting together a fish fry.
