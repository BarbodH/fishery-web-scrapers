1078529,Dara,2022-02-09 17:18:00,3052,I was just given a eagle cuda 300 depth finder for ice fishing. I need to hook a battery to it but I don't have the portable battery pack or plug that connects to battery wire. it has a plug with a T slot and a pin each side. Is there any way to know which side is pos neg without cutting the plug off and just using the red and black

1078533,DanD,2022-02-09 22:04:00,2223,I found a user manual. Manual It definitely is a 12-volt unit and the red lead is the positive connector. So any 12-volt battery pack (8D cell battery pack?) will work. It would likely be better to get a rechargeable 12 volt supply that can handle a 3amp long-term discharge. There are all kinds of packs that you can find in places like Animalzon. (Amazon) Dan.

If you have the correct transducer it will have a cable from the transducer to the plug and another cable coming from the plug that is the power cable. Within the black outer jacket of this cable you will find a black and red wire (positive/negative) Hope that helps"
1078542,Dara,2022-02-10 15:32:00,3052,Thanks guys. I have the manual and plug but not the battery box and need to know what side of plug is red. Gotta do what smitty said and poke a hole in the black and see what pin it connects to in the plug. Unless the guy that gave me the unit finds the battery box
1078550,DanD,2022-02-10 20:39:00,2223,Below is a quote from the manual. So connect it to positive and negative one way. If the unit doesn't turn on. Reverse the connections at the battery. Dan...
