1078076,akaShag,2022-01-14 17:16:00,2073,"Thanks for this.  It had been a while since I looked at it.  Yes indeed, it gives me the names of a number of lakes, some of which are known by me to contain whitefish.  But I know of nobody who catches whities with anything like regularity on any of them.  😢  Kind of like hunting for unicorns around here."
