1078032,scottyiam,2022-01-12 17:43:00,5,I catch a lot of bass in the lower niagara river. I'd love to catch a few walleyes. Any tips on what you use  and the average depth you fish would be appreciated. I drift for bass using a carolina rig 15 to 25 feet and in the fall fish the mouth of the river tossing crankbaits and such. There are some bruts in there
1078065,Steve Piggott,2022-01-13 22:54:00,196,"Hair jig, jigging spoons, swim baits. Same drifts as the bows and bass"
1078066,scottyiam,2022-01-13 23:51:00,5,Thanks for the reply......That is one beautiful walleye....
1078150,SuperD,2022-01-17 00:37:00,12,Very Nice! Have a wonderful year!
