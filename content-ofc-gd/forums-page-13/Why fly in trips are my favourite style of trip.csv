1077947,gordy28,2022-01-07 00:11:00,638,"I get asked a lot about my favorite outdoors trip. ¬† While they have always been amazing if pressed I would say my most memorable trip was the first fly in outpost trip I did in 2014. At this stage I would say fly in outpost trips are my preferred trip, for a lot of different reasons. ¬†¬†¬†A big one for me is that feeling when the plane leaves you at the dock on ‚Äúyour‚Äù lake for the week Here‚Äôs my reasons why https://www.northernjacks.com/post/why-fly-in-outpost-trips-are-the-best Andrew "
1077976,Bill,2022-01-08 19:55:00,140,I enjoy your reports. They are kind of like I was with you by the way you write.
1078000,gordy28,2022-01-10 01:03:00,638,Thanks appreciate the compliment! ¬† Have a few trips on tap for 2022 to be written up 
1078001,Rizzo,2022-01-10 13:39:00,4754,must be nice!
1078004,410001661,2022-01-10 17:15:00,127,Something about the plane pulling away and leaving you there for 7 days!  
1078017,BillM,2022-01-12 00:42:00,17367,"I love fly-ins, but some of my best trips have been drive to.¬† ¬†Although there are trips like the Sutton River, which will basically be impossible to top."
1078025,Iggy,2022-01-12 16:10:00,19,"I used to fly in to the Dumoine in Quebec every year, it was a lot of fun, but now you can drive and it saves a lit of money, fishing is just as good to. Flew into Esnagi (sp) out of White River, McQuat out of Atikokan and a couple out of Nakina. I agree, when the plane pulls out, it's like the weight of the world is pulled off your shoulders"
1078260,gordy28,2022-01-20 13:42:00,638,For sure. ¬† Drive ins are a solid option as our bait ins or paddle tos A big chunk of my fishing is done on busier cottage lakes which is why I think I love getting away from the crowds so much thanks for all of the comments Andrew 
1078323,wvmedic,2022-01-25 01:54:00,144,Love reading your stories
1078324,Iggy,2022-01-25 02:07:00,19,"Try one, then you'll know what we mean.¬† They are awesome I once flew in with canoes strapped to the pontoons to paddle out the Dumoine River. A white water canoe trip. The only thing I regret is I didn't bring a fishing rod. My kids were with me. A bit scary because of the kids but a great memory"
1078326,wvmedic,2022-01-25 02:25:00,144,"I was supposed to do a fly in with Air Ivanhoe two years ago, would have been my first one. I was so looking forward to it, then Covid hit. Maybe in the near future I will try again.  Jeff"
1078330,Iggy,2022-01-25 12:24:00,19,"Probably the safest place in the world during covid, not only are you away from covid, your away from all the media flatulence. ü§£"
