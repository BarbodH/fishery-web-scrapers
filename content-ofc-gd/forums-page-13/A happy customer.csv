Yesterday, fishing for perch, buddy beside me was fishing a dropper above his bottom lure (usually a Buckshot), and I was fishing with a Buckshot, or a Forage Minnow, and no dropper.Â  I would say that I outfished him for numbers, and we were about even for larger perch.Â  No jumbos hit the top hook, which was interesting.Â  We were inside a shelter and able to sight-fish for the most part.Â  The perch were mostly coming in as singles and doubles, rather than in schools.Â  I think if we had been seeing schools of fish, the dropper would have been more successful.
