1078514,aplumma,2022-02-07 22:55:00,6896,Well Karma really is a good friend. After drooling over pictures of small lures for Crappie and other panfish I made a wish and Misfish sent me a care package in the mail. I am amazed at the creative mind and the talent in his hands that found a new home down here in the South. Thank you once again Brian for the more than generous gift and I will report how well they work after the thin ice melts and allows me to go fishing again. Art
