PS) I did not originally write ""difficult"" to find, but the auto-correct did not like my choice of words and substituted a stupid word (""jerk"") for what I wrote.Â  Don't we love technology...ðŸ™„"
1078146,Dara,2022-01-16 23:45:00,3052,This being a family forum I am happy with the auto correct. Too bad it didn't correct the demeaning r word you managed to slip in as well

1036323,PUMP KNOWS,2018-11-11 02:46:00,937,"Iâ€™m looking for slip on tractionÂ cleats to put on my boots for ice fishing. Â They gotta be easy to slip on and off and provide good traction. What are you guys using on the ice? I forgot which ones I bought last year but they were very hard to slip on my boots. If I canâ€™t find any, I was thinking of drilling studs to my Baffin Titans."

1036339,crappieperchhunter,2018-11-11 12:23:00,2582,I've been telling people this for probably 20 years. Get a box of 3/8 hex head screws and drill them into the bottom of your baffins. Replace worn screws as necessary. Â I usually have to do a few every season. A box of 100 screws will last a long time. No slip on crap to worry about.
1036343,SirCranksalot,2018-11-11 13:55:00,3291,"I'd be worried that the screws would put a hole in the sole of the boot, but I guess it's a matter of using a shortish screw and leaving some margin of error. "
1036362,Sinker,2018-11-11 20:44:00,8692,"Had the same set for many years. I only wear them on glare ice, but they are tough and work very well if its slippery. A little heavy, but better than smacking your head off the ice. S."
1036363,misfish,2018-11-11 21:05:00,29133,Dont forget to take your boots off before driving home though. Right Steve ? I remember that story you told.
1036364,misfish,2018-11-11 21:06:00,29133,Had a pair. Hated them. Velcro comes off and your walking on the edge of them.
1036365,DRIFTER_016,2018-11-11 21:47:00,10439,The ones I hear about most on my ice fishing boards and groups areÂ KahtoolaÂ MICROspikesÂ andÂ Yaktrax Pro.
1036375,Sinker,2018-11-12 01:32:00,8692,Mine have worked great for me. I have a size 14 boot. They are tight. Heavy though. And horrible in snow.

1036715,David Chong,2018-11-19 21:20:00,836,I've been using the HT Omni-Tech Sandals for the last couple of years and have been happy with them! They are a little heavier than the slip on ones but they almost never come off!Â http://htice.com/SCL-2/
1036722,SirCranksalot,2018-11-19 23:19:00,3291,Really? I have a pair like that and they keep falling off no matter what I do. Maybe it depends a lot on the boots. I have Titans. 
1036724,David Chong,2018-11-20 00:03:00,836,I wear them on a pair of Baffins! Now I have noticed that there seems to have been different versions of these. Not sure if I just got the right pair or not!

1077934,Canuck,2022-01-05 16:18:00,491,I am refreshing this thread to add a thumbs up for Icers cleats for walking on ice. Â Lee Valley sells them and my wife got a set and called them a game changer for walking the dogs on icy trails around our place. So I got myself a set too. Fantastic. And made in Canada too (New Brunswick).
1078028,akaShag,2022-01-12 16:39:00,2073,"If you can get your size. Last year they had sold out of my size by this time of year, and I bought the cheap ones from CTC that work good enough."
1078036,Canuck,2022-01-12 18:43:00,491,We tried last year too. They have much more stock now. At least in Burlington store. Â  I did see a similar style at Crappy Tire last week when I was looking for thermal undies. They did not have as nice strapping though.
