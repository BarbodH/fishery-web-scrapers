OMG, That is more snow then I thought that's for sure.I thought the wind would of swiped most if not, at least half that snow off the bay. 10,000 steps and 6 lbs lost I think. I will pay for it tomorrow. Getting old sucks EH.LOL. I managed one on the Williams and a juvi on my high hook sow fly that was released, along with a few dink herring. When I was packing up, there was a 16 ft radius of slush around me under the snow. It is going to be a mess out there with Wednesday temps reaching +2 here. .The one kept is going to be smoked candy tomorrow.   "
