1078374,lovetofish,2022-01-29 15:30:00,500,Hey guys. Me and a buddy are taking the kids to Bellwood tomorrow to target some pike. Have never fished there in the winter. Any advice on where to start or a depth to look for? Thanks in advance for any help
1078376,Wallyman,2022-01-29 15:42:00,31,I found you didn't have to go far.  I would stay in the 10 -20 ft range.  Pike cruise at all depths.   There are two bays you could try.  One is straight across the other is to the right of the boat ramp.  Good luck.
1078381,lovetofish,2022-01-30 01:40:00,500,Thanks for the info.
1078382,Rizzo,2022-01-30 02:16:00,4754,let us know how it goes!
1078401,lovetofish,2022-01-31 23:42:00,500,Not a bite! Sooo many people out too!
1078402,Rizzo,2022-02-01 00:36:00,4754,I have some friends who fish walleye there. Pretty far from the access point though. Don't know what the pike fishing is like
1078405,AKRISONER,2022-02-01 02:27:00,5558,"Go to island lake, there’s a billion pike in there"
1078428,Rizzo,2022-02-02 01:19:00,4754,agreed. I have heard nothing but success stories about Island Lake and pike. I don't think you will get big ones there but the numbers are apparently good. And for a kid...even a 20 inch pike is a huge fish
1078429,lovetofish,2022-02-02 01:35:00,500,Gonna hit the Grande River tomorrow on a solo mission.
1078434,AKRISONER,2022-02-02 15:44:00,5558,"This was in 2016 (Wow i cannot believe it has been that long yeeeesh) but we caught if I remember, 4 this size on island lake that day. Theres a million snot rockets too, plus a pile of perch. Any time we dead sticked a minnow head on a small jig on bottom we would catch perch. "
1078449,lovetofish,2022-02-03 01:04:00,500,"Did get out for a few hours today. Marked some fish, no hook ups. Weren’t there for any prime time action. Got there at 10:30, left at 1:30. It was nice to get out and explore some new ice "
1078454,akaShag,2022-02-03 13:51:00,2073,"Thanks for adding to my education.  I did not know they made pants in ""teal"" colour.  😁  I had an F-150 that colour.............. Doug"
1078466,misfish,2022-02-03 18:20:00,29133,"I finally got to me this young fella a couple weeks ago. He drives a black ram. The teal pants I will let slide, this time.LMAO I had an F-150 that colour.............. And Doug,I am not sure I would be telling anyone that,,,,,,,,,,,,,,LOL"
1078467,akaShag,2022-02-03 18:28:00,2073,"Yep.  It cost me about $1500 on a trade-in value.  When I wanted a new pickup, the sales guy said the only one they could find was TEAL.  I said I did not care what colour it was.  But when it was time for a new truck, it turned out that people DID care about colour.  Oh well, live and learn...............🙄 Doug"
1078468,AKRISONER,2022-02-03 19:30:00,5558,"Funny story about those pants, had an old roomate/tennant that left my place in a hurry and left a bunch of crap behind. My buddy wanted to go ice fishing and all of my gear was up north. I found those teal snowboard pants in the storage room. They were wayyyyy too big for me but I made them work for the day. I specifically remember my feet being so damn cold that day because I only had a crappy pair of Walmart bush boots that I borrowed from my other roomate lol"
