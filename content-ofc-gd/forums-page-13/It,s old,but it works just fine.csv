I hated to take it and do what I was going to do,but he was fine with it. SO,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, Skies Crates A detachable push handle Today was it,s first load and go .This is so easy to push. It,s like pushing a shopping cart. No restriction at all. Thanks pal.     As for the fishing, a perch and herring and snapped a huge pike off at the hole. His head was as big as the 6"" hole. I would say it was pushing 15lb. It was huge.   "
1078038,akaShag,2022-01-12 19:30:00,2073,"Good guy, Fisherman.Â  I've probably known him since that sled was built.Â  ðŸ˜‰  Why push, instead of pull, Brian?  	Doug"
1078039,Terry,2022-01-12 19:36:00,14456,It looks good
1078040,misfish,2022-01-12 20:02:00,29133,"It is so much easier Doug. I started by just pushing my old smitty with my spud bar. I could do it with one hand, it was that easy. This is why I went this method. and ya, his boys sat on this as he pulled them around. He told me the story of the sleigh. The braces are copper pipe. I will disassemble after this winter and give it a good she lac ."
1078041,akaShag,2022-01-12 20:06:00,2073,"I am guessing you are just using it on the flat, like not up and down hills and such?"

1078046,akaShag,2022-01-12 20:44:00,2073,1977 I think.
1078047,Fisherman,2022-01-12 20:58:00,7201,"I was still in Bagotville until 78, then went to Moisie until Aug 79 and then 1 MP PL."
