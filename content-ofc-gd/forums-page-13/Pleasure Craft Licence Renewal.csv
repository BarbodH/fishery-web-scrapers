1077807,akaShag,2021-12-23 00:32:00,2073,"now THERE is a new expression for me. Does it mean ""raping""? Doug"
1077808,aplumma,2021-12-23 01:12:00,6896,"Doug it is a very old saying dating back to an authors famous book from Mark TwainÂ  "" The adventures of Huck finn"" It was where he conned another person into painting a fence telling them how much fun it was. He was Huckle Bucked into doing hard labor disguisedÂ  as something fun. Chubby Checker also had a song and dance called the huckle buck as well. Art"
1077810,akaShag,2021-12-23 13:52:00,2073,"Thanks Art.Â  I have read that book, many moons ago.Â  In my home tome, we called that ""huck finn""Â  as in, I huck finned him into moving the woodpile for me."" Interesting expression! Doug"
1077935,Reelpro,2022-01-05 17:37:00,73,"Yes Transport Canada is going to make us all ""safer"" by renewing a lifetime boat registration number every 10 years for a fee. Another MONEY grab by the Federal Government - they also are attempting to extort more money for the commercial registration of vessels in Canada, at a time when most Canadian commercial vessel owners are on the brink of bankruptcy - especially the camp owners and outfitters - they do not need another fee hike by the Federal Government in 2022. Most people are unaware but about 10 yrs ago the FEDSÂ  - TC - changed the antiquated Vessel Registration for Canada -Â  Legislation that was intended for ships - Ocean going Ships. Well in their incredible incompetence they wrote the legislation to include EVERY commercially owned vessel. Well ""vessel"" means anything that floats basically - so yes they actually required a Canoe, rowboat, peddle boat to be Federally Registered in Canada if it was owned by a business for about a year until we got it changed - the morons had registration requiring notorized documents, photos, gross tonnage calculations for a darn canoe and peddle boat and rowboat. We were only able to get it up to a 10hp or more boat - so no more canoes etc, but still a disgusting piece of legislation emplaced by TCÂ  - every little fishing camp, lakeside resort in Canada is supposed to RE - register all the little boats they have for the camp from the free lifetime pleasure craft registration number they had to a Commercial Registration number and a renewal fee every 5 Years.Â  A legislation for Ocean going Ships applied to a 10 hp tinny in a tiny little lake in remote Canadian wilderness - nuts. Sadly there are thousands of camp and resort owners totally unaware of this legislation or are aware and have not bothered with it, and now they are subject to litigation exposure in the event of any accident, because their boat was not correctly registered with the government. Yes this is the same group of Bureaucrats who now want the Pleasure Craft licence to have a renewal date and a fee instead of the Free lifetime system, that has worked perfectly fine for decades. Perhaps its time for EVERY pleasure Craft owner in Canada to ignore TC - toss the pleasure craft renewal paper in the garbage where it belongs. The current system of pleasure craft licencing works fine, this new TC renewal plan is a pure money grab, it is intended to support the bloated sunshine list payroll of TC - it does not make anyone any safer - even if this ""agenda"" came from the JOKE - ""office of boating safety"" - yes the same ones that invented an online PCOC licence - yes that really made us all better/safer boat operators right ? Money Grab - no benefit to any Canadian citizen, only benefit TC payroll support. Renewal - toss it   "

1077938,JMFJMF,2022-01-06 01:22:00,18,"I guess it depends if the paddles are the upscale carbon fiber models. And if you also have carbon or graphite rods and reels, and a cooler full of carbonated drinks, the carbon tax could become quite scary."

1077728,HTHM,2021-12-17 18:43:00,4082,I thought that the boater card and the hull registration were for life.

1077740,LeXXington,2021-12-18 01:02:00,1928,I would think the hull picture is an attempt to slow thief's. Like a car registration you also need to update when you move.
1077741,Fisherman,2021-12-18 01:39:00,7201,"No, mine expires in Feb 2022, just by chance I looked.Â  You can renew 3 months ahead of expiry.Â  Already got an email back saying it's accepted and should get an email copy in 2 weeks or so."
