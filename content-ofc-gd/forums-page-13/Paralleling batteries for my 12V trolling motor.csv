1078199,Salmon Catcher,2022-01-18 17:51:00,15,Paralleling same voltage batteries increases total ah ampere hours. Ampere hours is same thing as battery capacity. While charging such parallel batteries no wire connection change is required. Treat it as one battery. All else is a myth. 
1078201,Salmon Catcher,2022-01-18 17:56:00,15,"While paralleling batteries try to keep them close in ampere hour size , similar capacity. It is better to parallel two batteries 50 hr each then paralleling 50 ah battery  with 5 ah one."
1078202,Salmon Catcher,2022-01-18 17:59:00,15,"Reason for above, if you charge them connected as is, the smaller one will get overcharged or bigger one will get undercharged."
1078226,410001661,2022-01-19 17:17:00,127,"Hooking up batteries in series or parallel the batteries should only be done with identical make and specification of battery or you will have issues. In my application I am connecting two new and identical batteries 27DC-180 (MCA=1,000, RES=175, Ah=105) in parallel with #2AWG with crimped and shrink wrapped jumpers.  I am connecting each bank of my ProSport 2-bank onboard battery charger to a battery."
1078249,DanD,2022-01-19 22:52:00,2223,"Regardless of series or parallel circuits, depending on the application. The circuit is only as strong as the weakest battery. Yes brand new identical batteries are the best to start with; but after some time, even these batteries need to be tested individually. Making sure they have all survived being discharged and recharged numerous times. Here's a good example of what I'm saying. My golf cart we use at our trailer is a 36 volt system. 6, 6volt batteries connected in series. Being a used cart I replace all the 6 batteries with the same make and size. The cart worked perfectly for about 5 years; using a self regulating charger. After that the carts running time slowly decreased to the point that at a full charge, we wouldn't get a weekend out of that charge. Being a mechanic I have equipment to test batteries. After allowing the battery pack to fully charge, I performed a discharge test on the pack and it seemed to pass but barely. Disconnected the batteries from each other, charged and tested them individually and found that 2 of the batteries were not accepting a charge properly. They quickly fell well below the manufacturer's rating during a load test. After only replacing those 2 batteries the cart ran as intended. Yes eventually I replace all the batteries again; but by doing so I added a few year worth of use with the original batteries that I installed. Dan."
1078255,Salmon Catcher,2022-01-19 23:44:00,15,"Battery Capacity, battery power, battery AH ampere hours is same thing. Benefit of paralleling batteries is to increase total battery power. Two batteries in parallel will run your trolling motor longer then one. That is the benefit."
1078262,AKRISONER,2022-01-20 14:53:00,5558,"Theres math involved and Im sure a graph somewhere that will show you running a more powerful 24 system will outperform a 12v system with more AH and reserve capacity. This is the main thing here, if you are carrying two group 31's in the boat anyways you should be running them for 24v."
1078269,410001661,2022-01-20 16:36:00,127,You are correct.  At the similar Ah rating a series rated 24V system will out perform a 12V system.  The have a 12V system and wiring them in parallel this is the best solution for what I am running - short of dripping $3k for a new trolling motor. 
1078271,Salmon Catcher,2022-01-20 18:27:00,15,"All chart plotters, sonars, radars, downriggers run on 12 volts DC. What is the point complicating electric circuit wiring it to 24V?  No matter how you connect your batteries in series or parallel you will have same total capacity=total power=combined ampere hours.  Can not violate formula Power= Voltage * Current If you need some exotic voltage like 18DC,  use dc to ac inverter and ac to 18V dc supply. That complicates circuit and introduces more potential problem down the road. I would not run my critical navigation equipment on such power source.   "
1078273,Salmon Catcher,2022-01-20 18:51:00,15,The higher voltage systems can supply same amount of power with smaller power loss due to wire resistance. This is why most high power AC lines feeding  large industrial consumers are at 24 000 volts. 24K transformer outside each plant drops it down to 600V fed inside the building. If you run large electric motor at 100A current at 600V you need finger size copper wire. On a high side 24kv of this step down transformer you have  only 2.5 A current and only requires telephone size copper wire to run this motor. Talking about boat application this power loss over boat el wiring is miniscule. Not worth discussion. Keep in mind: two 12v  batteries in series for 24v if one of them goes bad it will drag overall performance. If one battery goes open (internally) you loose your power. Two batteries in parallel if one goes (open) you still have power from a good one. Redundancy. There is no redundancy in 24V configuration for two 12v batteries. 
1078283,BillM,2022-01-21 04:01:00,17367,"Who said anything about the guy rewiring his boat for 24V?   We're talking trolling motors here.  Some guys mentioned he'd be better off running a 24V setup, vs a 12V setup.  But, as the OP stated, that's not in the cards so he'll be simply increasing the capacity of his 12V setup by adding an additional battery. "
1078287,AKRISONER,2022-01-21 13:50:00,5558,"Not to hijack the thread, but since it is being brought up…you should see the insanity around going 24v now for guys running livescope/mega live etc etc. im personally a big time believer in over gauging, looming and really clean dedicated runs to avoid line loss for your electrical installation. Garmin even shows you by displaying the unit’s voltage plain as day what kind of line loss you experiencing  but I’m not a believer in the whole 24v Bull. by the way, If you wire your marine electronics into your boat’s bus fuse block, you’ve just waisted all of that money. My father is the “function” over “form” type being an old farmer…sure as turd, he’s running the exact same electronics set up as me and his looks like absolute garbage and there’s a disaster of interference all over his livescope and 2d sonar. I offered to rewire it all for him because I enjoy dc wiring and use his boat regularly, but as far as he is concerned, he did a great job because the thing turns on! Can’t ever tell your old man nothing lol"
1078288,Salmon Catcher,2022-01-21 15:19:00,15,"As you mentioned above, most modern electronics display dc voltage it is feeding on. Just bought cigarette lighter plug with dc voltage display. While all your gadgets are down when starting engine this meter shows how low your battery dips down at starting time. This cranking voltage should not go lower than 10V. If it does you have undercharged battery or it starts to go lazy and may need replacement soon.

1077451,410001661,2021-12-02 22:58:00,127,"Hi Guys, 	I purchased a Minnkota Powerdrive V2 (12V) with iPilot for my StarCraft Renegade 168DC boat.  I would like to wire up (in parallel) two new, identical 12V marine batteries (27DC-180   MCA=1,000  RES 180 min  A.H. 120).  These two batteries will be feeding my MinnKota PowerDrive V2 trolling motor with iPilot.  Can I hardwire these batteries in parallel using and #2AWG flex cables and then connect the leads to the trolling motor. Is this a best practice or should I wire both batteries to a transfer switch and then toggle between them as needed.  The only issue I see with this is charging the batteries - I would have to charge battery #1 then move the switch to the second position to charge battery #2.  Presently I am using a ProSport 12 two bank battery charger. Thanks - John  "
1077452,Terry,2021-12-02 23:29:00,14456, you can only use one bank of the charger to charge the batteries
1077453,Fisherman,2021-12-02 23:29:00,7201,"Yes you can use 2AWG, that way both batteries get identical use.  You can charge them in parallel this way with one charger."
1077454,BillM,2021-12-03 00:31:00,17367,You definitely don't want to switch between batteries.  Wire them in parallel and enjoy the extra capacity.
1077459,Garnet,2021-12-03 11:20:00,2056,24 volt troller is the way to go. You have the battery's . If you buy quick connects to change battery's and the cables for parallel would be cost of the 24 volt troller plus your 12 volt.
1077461,410001661,2021-12-03 14:47:00,127,"I already have a 12V trolling motor with iPilot.  To replace that motor for a 24V unit it would be around $2,400 even if I could find one. Paralleling the two identical 12V batteries doubles my capacity (120A.H. x2 batteries - 240A.H.) while keeping my voltage the same.  If I wired the two identical batteries in series my system voltage would double to 24V but my capacity would remain the same (120 A.H.).  I would much rather have the increased capacity IMHO."
1077462,410001661,2021-12-03 14:55:00,127,I received an email from ProSport and they are advising me to connect one bank of charging leads to one battery and the other bank of charging leads to the other battery even if they are wired in parallel.
1077463,Fisherman,2021-12-03 15:55:00,7201,"Yes that can be done, just undo one of the 2AWG wires between the batteries when doing that."
1077464,Terry,2021-12-03 16:17:00,14456,"Exactly, when in parallel they act as one battery you can’t charge one battery with 2 chargers they shut each other off when they detect the voltage from each other Disconnect  one connector will let you charge them with 2 banks"
1077466,Sinker,2021-12-03 21:00:00,8692,"I have this set up, and do it as you described. I just have the two batteries wired together with the 2 AWG jumpers, then the TM connected to one battery.  My charger is connected to one battery, and they both charge. It takes a little longer to charge them if they are low, but still faster than charging 2 separately, and its very rare that I drain them. I charge them on 10A. I can troll steady at 1.5mph for hours and hours with no worries about draining the batteries. S."
1077469,AKRISONER,2021-12-03 21:44:00,5558,"Honest question about your application and usage...is there any specific reason for wanting two batteries for that much capacity? Are you a heavy troller using specifically the trolling motor? The boys and I have put some extremely long hours on the boats and never once has anyone ever ran out of juice for their TM. To the point that our main batteries were low from running the graphs all day. Do you specifically fish places for multiple days without access to a charger in open water? The idea of using two batteries simply for capacity seems like a lot of weight for not much benefit, especially if you only have a 2 bank charger. personally? save yourself a hell of a lot of money, weight and hassle, buy yourself 1 really high quality large AGM battery and call it a day."
1077477,Garnet,2021-12-04 15:39:00,2056,Hooking 2 battery's in parallel doesn't make 24 volts. It's still 12 volt system and runs out of stuffing quick. A 24 volt system you will run your troller on a lower setting and still have  plenty of up power when wind gets mean. 24 volt system is worth every dime.
1077478,Fisherman,2021-12-04 15:45:00,7201,I think you need another look at basic electronics.  12 volts with 240 AMP/hrs will get you just as far as 24 volts with 120 Amp/hrs.  Either way you get 2880 watts of power.
1077479,Terry,2021-12-04 15:53:00,14456,A 24 volt system pulling a boat  at the same mph as a 12 volt system will last much longer mostly because of the amps needed to obtain the same speed the more amp the more heat is produced and heat wastes extra power
1077480,410001661,2021-12-04 17:11:00,127,batteries in parallel double your capacity.......and will last longer Batteries in series double your voltage
1077483,AKRISONER,2021-12-04 19:02:00,5558, this
1077486,Garnet,2021-12-05 14:34:00,2056,24 volt trolling motor will 100% less amps. So your 12 volt  on 6 a little over half your 24 will be on 3. If the wind blows your 12 volt will quickly be on 10. The 24 comes with larger prop so will handle the wind much better. So 100% more efficient use of battery power and larger prop to handle conditions.
1077504,DanD,2021-12-06 20:36:00,2223,"Sorry to some of the guys here; but the OP didn't ask for opinions of 12 volt verses 24 volts. OP asked, if the way he's wired his 12 volt batteries was a good way to do it. Yes (IMHO) it is probably the best way of getting the most out a 12 volt system. As for charging the batteries, just use the one bank of the charger for the two that are connected in parallel and the other bank to charge the starting battery; assuming you have one? As Shane (Sinker) said it will take longer to recharge the TM batteries; but 6-10 hours at 10amps should bring them back to full. Every fisher needs to sleep sometime. LOL So plug in the charger; let your Toddy of water, honey, cinnamon and your favorite whiskey warm and enjoy. Knowing the batteries will be happy and ready to go in the morning. Dan."
1077508,410001661,2021-12-07 00:42:00,127,"Thanks Dan.  I already have a 12V TM with iPilot and forking out $2,400 - $3,000 for a 24V TM is not gonna happen."
1077548,Sinker,2021-12-09 17:25:00,8692,"Forgot to mention, it is a lot easier on your batteries. I can kill one 31DC battery in a day trolling for walleye, but with the 2 in parallel, they only get drained down maybe 60%, so they aren't getting as much abuse. Before I added the second battery, i was lucky to get 2 full seasons out on one battery. With the two batteries, I am going into my 4th or 5th season and they are still as new.  I also have the option of removing a battery if I wan't to lose 80lbs of weight out of the boat (ie duck hunting) and it helps a lot.  S."
1078030,Salmon Catcher,2022-01-12 16:48:00,15,Wiring batteries in parallel or in series will not change your total battery capacity (total power). Im salmon troller on Great Lakes. Before that while fishing in small boats used to have electric charger built in to 7.5 Johson outboard to run graphs.
1078033,410001661,2022-01-12 17:49:00,127,Sorry but connecting batteries different ways you get different results: - Series:  Capacity remains the same but your voltage is additive (12V+12V=24V) - Parallel:  Voltage remains the same and your Ah is additive Trust me on this.......I'm a master electrician
1078034,Salmon Catcher,2022-01-12 17:59:00,15,
1078035,Salmon Catcher,2022-01-12 17:59:00,15,"My message above does not dispute your statement. It says ampere hours do not change. P=U * I You must be familiar with this formula. Folks on this site attempting to play with two batteries to get more power. Industrial electrician, retired."
1078197,410001661,2022-01-18 17:39:00,127,I think you might want to look at that again.  If you parallel two identical batteries your Ah rating of your batteries double (you add them together).  Remember doing series and parallel circuits in trade school? If your battery capacity did not change what would be the benefit of paralleling two batteries?
