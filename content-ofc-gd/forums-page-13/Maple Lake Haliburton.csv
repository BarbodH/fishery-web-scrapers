1078072,bobowski,2022-01-14 12:58:00,360,Hey guys. I have a trip planned for Maple Lake next week. I've never fished it before so I'm going in blind. Does anyone have any info on where to start to get into some Lakers and Walleye? Any info would be greatly appreciated. I want to get the boys on some fish. Feel free to PM if you like. Thanks. Tight lines

Permanent huts are on the 35-40 reef off the north west end. On the north shore, guys fish off the parking area in 20 feet of water. Same for the south shore. I have caught wallys in 20ft and 50 ft of water. Lakers & Wallys hang around the reef. Watch for thin ice around the Gull River exit on the west end. Good luck."
