1078669,Snakecharmer,2022-02-17 00:22:00,30,"Back in the day, I rec'd my introduction to Canadian fishing at Rock Garden Camp on Blackstone Lake. The cottages were housekeeping with no showers and we used an outhouse. I would like to break in my grandsons to a place with housekeeping cottages with indoor plumbing. Any recommendations in the Parry Sound area. Species of interest- bass and pike. Musky and pickeral will do too. Kids will just want to catch fish. I enjoyed Pleasant Cove near Pointe Au Baril which is now probably #1 if they are still in business. Any other options? "

1078677,Snakecharmer,2022-02-17 02:59:00,30,Looks promising! Thanks.  Have you stayed there?
1078691,AKRISONER,2022-02-17 18:36:00,5558,yup if pleasant cove isnt a go rockpine would be my number 2 choice. They rent boats too.

Running that business is probably not as lucrative as we would think. For some giggles look at the prices for these rentals. Whoever is renting them has some serious coin....What's $5,000- $15,000 a week. YIKES Boutique Cottage Rentals & Waterfront Cottages - Jayne's Cottages (jaynescottages.com) "
