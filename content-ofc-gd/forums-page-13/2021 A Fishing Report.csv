1077945,JonnyButts,2022-01-06 21:29:00,40,"Howdy folks , thought it was time to do an annual report . I’m always on here and appreciate everyone that takes the time to post.  2021 is a year I’ll never forget and not because of the fishing but we will get into that .  Started off the year doing my normal Winter steelheading and trout chasing . Nothing really to report there . Some cold days and some warmer than usual , lost a ton of streamers but that’s how it goes sometimes .  Had one Pike outing with Mepps but we didn’t dial them in , new waters and all but it was fun .  Since I’ve caught this Musky bug all my focus and preparation has gone into getting ready for June.  We did a scouting mission the end of May and made some great observations and put down a few pins .  Just as things were about to get fired up , I got the news that my old man had stage 4 terminal cancer . One of the many downsides to this pandemic is that the lack of Dr appointments, virtual appointments and delays in testing and they just aren’t catching things in time .  It was a tough blow and I packed up and headed to Peterborough to spend the last 3 months he had with the old man. I gotta give props to the Peterborough hospital palliative care team and also Hospice Peterborough . Those people and what they do are the true Hero’s of our communities.  I managed to get a couple of trips in whenever Pops would tell me to take a day off . Caught one small juvenile ski on a shadzilla jr. on a day trip .  Really gotta thank Mepps for the support during that time and getting me out to fish and just clear my mind .  It was a way too short battle with cancer and I am grateful I had the opportunity to be with him everyday till his last . Rest In Peace Pops , I know you are looking down on me.  With the funeral taken care of and his affairs settled I headed back to Niagara and back to life , the family and chasing Muskies .  Mepps and I got back on schedule and usually were out once if not twice a week working the spots we had success at last year while discovering new structure and techniques.  Thanksgiving Monday we took our first of a few trips down to Lake St. Clair , it was so warm we were in T- Shirts . Insane for Turkey Monday.  We entered the lineup of 60 other boats that morning trolling the mouth of the Thames . The water was a chocolate brown and reminded me of the chocolate milk we got as kids in school.  Managed to catch a decent pike trolling a jointed believer in the prop wash. Snot rocket went nuts boat side and wrapped itself up good in the 65 lb braid .  Come early afternoon we packed it up and took the short run to the Detroit River , got a decent fish on the troll, she smashed a Supernatural Headlock towards the end of our run.  Spent a couple of days down on St Clair In October and November but the constant poor conditions didn’t lead to much luck in the ways of boating fish . Last trip down there the water temps had hit 37 degrees and it was a long shift of trolling to come up skunked. Safe to say Lady St. Clair still hasn’t come through for us lads lately.  Back on the home waters I had much better luck the month of November , multiple hook ups and ended up landing 5 decent fall fish .  Mepps and I sure did put the time in. Learned a bunch and figured out a couple of good runs , I finally felt like we were building a pattern .  Let me just say that jigging for Muskies in fast current is not for the faint of heart. You catch a snag and if someone doesn’t get on the main motor quick you will find yourself spooled . Happened to me once or twice lol.  December hit and any pattern We thought we had just shut down , dang Muskies changed it up on us .  The weekend before Closer we had a monster storm roll through on Erie , I’ve never seen the water that stained in the river . Sure did make fishing tough , we put in long days the last 2 days of season to only see one fish on the end of Mepps line .  Ended the season not too successful but when I looked back on the season as a whole I did better than last and learned a ton .  The one thing about being out with Mepps is we are always talking , analyzing our last trips , sharing knowledge and pushing each other to be better Anglers . It sure doesn’t take fish to have a good fishing trip , you just gotta have the right people around ya.  2021 is a year I’ll never forget , one I’m both happy and sad to put behind me and as I settle back into steelheading and chasing trout , I’m already dreaming and scheming for this June.  Life is short , my Fathers advice to me at 71 , only 6 years into his retirement and stuck in a hospital bed fighting a losing battle was “ Don’t wait on doing anything you want to do, get out and live your dreams now. Don’t waste your life busy working all the time.  When you reach to the end of your time here , all you have is the memories you made with the ones you loved. Always put your family first and yourself second “  Words I’m trying to live by now.  Thanks for reading and tightlines everyone. "
