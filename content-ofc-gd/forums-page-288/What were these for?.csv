Unfortunately I can't contact the previous owner, and when I bought it I never really asked. I was thinking they were either for down-riggers or some kind of mast attachment :/ "
802053,fishindevil,2013-08-07 10:51:00,6254,"yes the 4 screws look like the mounting plate for big john riggers and the 2 single ones look like they could have been for rod holders ?? most times a planner mast is on the front ...thats what it looks like to me,if you are not going to use them at least seal them up with good quality marine silicone,so water will not get down inside there in case you have wood inside there...."
