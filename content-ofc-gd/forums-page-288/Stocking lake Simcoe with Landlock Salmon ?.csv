802984,glen,2013-08-13 01:14:00,2641,I can see walleye being very popular.   Ok now go.
802989,dhickey,2013-08-13 01:34:00,1038,x 2. I just looked to find Native fish in Simcoe and came up with nothing but perch? I find that hard to believe seeing as it was at one time an amazing place to fish many/many years past. That stocking is the only way to prevent depletion.???? That puts me on to another topic you all don't want to hear.  Simcoe has become nothing but a stocked lake and there is nothing we can do about it falling short of banning any economic growth?(pollution)  Not to mention people that have complete disregard for rules or conservation.  Example.  Last long weekend I as well as my kids witnessed  persons not from Canada keeping everything including bass 6 inches as well as sunfish/perch and rock bass and they thought they hit the Mother load? Meanwhile our kids are out there catching 2-4 pound bass and thinking nothing of putting them back.???  This is a back lake 4 hours away for us and 14 away for the people Im discusted at.  Rant is done for now.  Don.
802990,glen,2013-08-13 01:37:00,2641,Yep might as well dig a hole and crawl in.
802996,Terry,2013-08-13 01:48:00,14456,"  they have cut back on stocking on simcoe because lots for natural reproduction of lake trout and whitiefish herring are coming back  bass fishery on simcoe is amazing  and lots of, well not lots but many people are getting walleye too and remember More people fish Lake Simcoe then all the lakes in Manitoba"
803000,ehg,2013-08-13 01:56:00,2666,"Ya rainbows are native to Pacific.   Musky are native and once dominated the lake. They should do well.  Walleye are native, there are some huge ones, but are never targeted. They should stock them."
803007,dhickey,2013-08-13 02:18:00,1038,Yes Terry it is bouncing back.  And its about time.  My point is let it bounce back. I just don't feel that introducing new fish is the way to go. The smelt are coming back and the herring can be a pain in the but at times but its bait for the big girls we want to catch?  My point is that most of the fish  we catch are stocked bass included.  In my little place in this world I would like to hit Simcoe and have the choice of fishing lakers/whiteys/pike/perch or smelt. Like when I was a kid and my Dad took me out fishing.(pipe dream)  Don.
803009,glen,2013-08-13 02:23:00,2641,Everybody likes pickerel.
803013,irishfield,2013-08-13 02:34:00,26272,mmmm.. Pickeral !
803016,dhickey,2013-08-13 02:43:00,1038,They have been doing that its not working so good??
803020,ehg,2013-08-13 02:58:00,2666,"The only fish they stock are about 150,000 lake trout and 100,000 whitefish a year. Now some musky are stocked which were over fished  about 60- 100 yrs ago. Even a couple of decades ago heard about the odd one caught.  My PB walleye/ pickerel at 16 lbs. came from Simcoe about 15 yrs. ago. Never stocked."
803036,dhickey,2013-08-13 04:17:00,1038,Where? And from everything Ive seen its a stocked fish... 15yrs ago? You got one of the first big girls.
803041,Terry,2013-08-13 08:57:00,14456,"for years my biggest walleye was 13.5 caught on simcoe from shore, same day a guy walked by with a 15 and an 18 lb walleye I have caught about 20 walleye between 8 and 13.5 lbs on simcoe half in beaverton and the rest in cooks bay  and when I was a kid we caught a few muskie every year , simcoe"
803185,fishindevil,2013-08-14 00:23:00,6254,Sturgeon are native to lake simcoe as well !!!! They used to net them by the thousands !!!! There are still some around too !!!!!
803228,Cudz,2013-08-14 05:35:00,2652,"About 27 years ago when I was in grade 9 I remember reading an old book on Simcoe.  At one time in the lakes life there were salmon in it. I think they were stocked Atlantics way back.  I might be wrong and they may have been pacific salmon.  Either way, it has already been tried. I looked at that little book about a thousand times throughout my high school days. I also remember seeing a pic in that book of a burbot that was caught in Simcoe and they slit the belly open to reveal something like 20 perch inside."
803277,Musky or Specks,2013-08-14 15:08:00,2710,I'm thinking it was Pink Salmon I think I might have read the same book.
803288,Fish Farmer,2013-08-14 16:07:00,2234,"I think Simcoe is to small a lake to stock Salmon and could eliminate the Herring. Just getting the Herring back has been a chore. They are great table fare for those who like eating fish, one of the best. Stock more Walleye and Whitefish would be a more natural fish for the lake. Now if we could get a catch limit for Herring would be great or a Herring stocking program."
803301,BillM,2013-08-14 16:55:00,17367,"Simcoe is just fine the way it is...  Great laker/whitie/smallmouth fishery, along with pike and largies...   Can't really complain about that."
803383,Cudz,2013-08-15 01:25:00,2652,Agree.  (I would also add perch to that list)
803385,BillM,2013-08-15 01:50:00,17367,Forgot the jumbos!
802883,misfish,2013-08-12 20:08:00,29133,"With the new testing of bringing the musky back to Simcoe and not really hearing or reading anything  saying they are making it,I was wondering if landlocks would be a better choice. The lake has enough bait fish and hearing imo to support them.  I think it would be a great addition to the lake. Both soft and hard water seasons. Seems they are very sustianable.  I was reading a bit on this and came across this interesting read..  http://www.maine.gov/ifw/fishing/species/identification/landlockedsalmon.htm   Your thoughts on this?"
802885,Christopheraaron,2013-08-12 20:16:00,3525,"I think it would be a pretty interesting experiment, doesn't seem like there are a lot of spawning area though."
802886,Rich,2013-08-12 20:17:00,3927,"This is the problem I believe. Most of Simcoe's creeks and tribs are hardly prime salmon run material. I believe the beaver would support a good run.  Also in retrospect, didn't the government scrap their chinook stocks and randomly switch to atlantics a few years back?"
802887,glen,2013-08-12 20:19:00,2641, Stock a two million rainbow a year.  Think about that.
802888,Rich,2013-08-12 20:20:00,3927,2 million lake sturgeon a year.  Think about THAT!  
802890,glen,2013-08-12 20:28:00,2641,The landlocked salmon are too small to troll for average 1.5lb.  Simcoe is a deep trolling lake and the lakers don't get me excited.  I wonder if Cabelas will help improve some of the fishing around here.
802891,glen,2013-08-12 20:29:00,2641,You arnt aloud to fish for sturgeon in ont.  also there is enough bottom feeders.
802893,Terry,2013-08-12 20:30:00,14456,works for me
802894,misfish,2013-08-12 20:31:00,29133,"Rainbows would work for sure,as they are] in the lake already,just not in big numbers and the tribs on Simcoe  could handle them. Theres an artical I read in the Canadian mag about improving the tribes for brook trout,which use to be a big thing back 40 years ago."
802895,Christopheraaron,2013-08-12 20:32:00,3525,"Forget rainbows, what about big browns?"
802896,misfish,2013-08-12 20:36:00,29133, Lets hope Glen.
802897,glen,2013-08-12 20:37:00,2641,Simcoe would be hot for walleye if they stocked them. I change my mind stock a million rainbow and a million walleye every year.  I would give up the lakers and whitefish for bows and walleye.
802898,Rich,2013-08-12 20:39:00,3927,That little laughy face at the bottom meant I was joking.
802900,John Bacon,2013-08-12 20:45:00,3277," No, Chinook stocking has remained steady at about ~540,000 fish per year in the Canadian side of Lake Ontario.  Georgian bay is stocked as well.  Metro East Anglers took over the rearing of Chinook for Lake Ontario for five years; but the MNR is raising them again.  The Atlantic (which is what the 'land locked' salmon are) program has not have any effect on the Chinook stocking so far."
802901,Richie Razor,2013-08-12 20:58:00,536,"How about stock chinooks and coho's in Simcoe?? You'd develop another fishing industry worth millions and be able to catch edible fish, unlike what comes out of Lake O.  Yeah, not a big laker fan either...., or how about more whites?"
802904,davey buoy,2013-08-12 21:03:00,5505,"A buddy,Tounament fisher,Last Sunday had a 4'plus muskie figure 8 him for a minute or so and just turned down.He has had several over the last 5 years grab or circle his figure 8.There are some veterans still in there and they do come around every now and than.""told me his secret lol""The last few years of stocking,I believe can't be bad.Any additional stocking won't hurt as well!! All for it!!"
802920,glen,2013-08-12 21:57:00,2641,As soon as they lift the ban on fishing them I will be the first one there.
802930,BillM,2013-08-12 22:34:00,17367,"Stock giant, triploid rock bass.  Instant classic!"
802934,OhioFisherman,2013-08-12 22:52:00,6623,How is Simcoe's smelt population? From reading the article Landlocks seem to center on them for food?
802935,Musky or Specks,2013-08-12 22:54:00,2710,"Atlantics were never native to Simcoe. Same with Chinooks and Coho's. The Ministry is a about rehabilitating existing or former existing fisheries not about experimenting.Those days are long over. I think the last time the minstry introduced an exotic species to an Ontario body of water was the Conestoga River with brown trout. But someone can chime in if I'm wrong. As was mentioned Rainbows,Walleye, and Musky already exist in Simcoe so you have to ask why hasn't the fishery taken off. In all cases its because the habitat isn't suitable or degraded to the point where succesful spawning and recruitment is impossible.In these times of austerity spending money on stocking is not a reality Let's spend our dollars on protection and rehabing of the existing fisheries-Conservation officers and spawning habitat improvement."
802938,kickingfrog,2013-08-12 22:58:00,8333,The rainbows would have been introduced as well.
802946,craigdritchie,2013-08-12 23:31:00,1586,"MuskyorSpecs is correct - MNR won't even think about stocking non-native species in Lake Simcoe. It's fun to fantasize about what could be, but no new species introductions will happen until there is a substantial shift in government policy. In other words, not in our lifetimes.  If we were to add any new species to Simcoe, my personal vote would be striped bass. I've fished for them in a lot of US lakes that are very similar to Simcoe (i.e. big, deep, cold, and great smallmouth fisheries). Stripers would be awesome - imagine 10 to 15 pound fish that are dumb as a bag of rocks, travel in large schools, and eat buzzbaits and Zara Spooks like crazy.  I guess I'll have to keep driving down to Tennessee and Kentucky to get my striper fix. Oh well. It sure beats ice fishing!"
802960,Terry,2013-08-13 00:09:00,14456, so how many trips would we have to do bringing stripers up from the US in our livewells   yeah I know we can transfer fish in livewells      we need a tanker truck   lol
802962,Richie Razor,2013-08-13 00:10:00,536,^^^^^ GREAT IDEA!!!!!!  But it's probably too cold for them. Sigh.
802965,danc,2013-08-13 00:23:00,4677, Best reply yet.
