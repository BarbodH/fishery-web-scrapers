802432,Beans,2013-08-09 16:56:00,3339," Strange kind of bite... Yesterday I thought it was about time I gave the old carp equipment a workout..it had been way too long since May 30th...  Got down to my friend Ron's area at 08:30 am and salted the area with boiled maize before I set-up...It was a strange kind of bite yesterday...all in all I had several wicked bumps (the kind that damn near bounces the rod out of the holders and only strips out a couple of feet of line). I had 4 long runs but after shutting off the ""free spool"" and setting the hook all I felt was the hook pulling out of the mouth of something small (not much weight to it) I also had 2 long runs and managed to land 2 big boys around 20 pounds (educated guess) One was a light beige colour and the other was a darker brown...(made me wish I had brought my camera...next time  )...  The old arm was pretty sore driving home but it was a nice kind of hurt knowing how I got it...Toying with the idea of going back down after my doctor's appointment next Tuesday...  Btw...the price of fishing just went up...when I reeled in for the last time it appeared that my palomar knot had come undone costing me the hook and  the swivel on my hair rig, a spring feeder and my boilie and kernel of monster maize...prob close to $3 worth of stuff...  Hang the expense...I'm going back on Tuesday anyways...!"

802467,vance,2013-08-09 22:34:00,719,"You cant admit to loosing gear EVER the fish huggers will be up in arms with you polluting the lake with things known to cause cancer in California.    Oh yeah pain is good, you KNOW it was caused by a really big one.."
802486,wormdunker,2013-08-10 01:05:00,1711,I only wish my arms were sore from reeling in fish!!  Lucky you!
802507,Sinker,2013-08-10 03:27:00,8692,I'll take strange bites any day! Better than no bites!  Easy on that arm lol  S
802513,dhickey,2013-08-10 05:36:00,1038,they were probably just a little lazy today.  As for next time you never know?
802566,Beans,2013-08-10 15:53:00,3339,     they were probably just a little lazy today.  As for next time you never know?   I'm thinking maybe it was small carp or bullheads...The carpers down Stratford way get the odd bullheads taking their corn and lots of smaller carp around 2 pounds...We never seem to catch carp less than 12 pounds in Ron's area but there must be smaller ones somewhere...might try putting a single kernel of corn on the hook of my hair rig next time...maybe the boilies or monster maize are too big...
802863,mercman,2013-08-12 17:07:00,7054,Great report Beans ! 3 bucks is a lot of cash to spend to have a great time!!!! I blew through many 3$ in my day ;-)
803287,Beans,2013-08-14 15:55:00,3339, Yesterday was quite a bit less expensive...lost three boilies and three monster maize to the carp...  Landed one around 15 pounds...lost one on a long distance release and the last one I had a hook pull-out at the net (saved me unhooking it)  Of course I forgot my camera again...When I do remember I'll probably get skunked...
