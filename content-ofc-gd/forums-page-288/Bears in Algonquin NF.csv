802782,northernpike56,2013-08-12 03:36:00,717,"I'm going to algonquin for half a day sometime this week, going in the west corridor. Are there any good spots such as dumps etc that I would have a good chance of seeing a blackbear at? Never actually seen one before. Will be heading in super early anyways so they would probably still be out looking for garbage to eat"
802783,John Bacon,2013-08-12 03:48:00,3277,"I am not sure about the park itself; but, if you are heading home through Bancroft the North Baptiste Lake Road dump used to have a lot bears.  I am not sure if this is still the case; people used leave fish there to attract them."
802784,backbay,2013-08-12 04:07:00,773,"The biggest black bears I ever saw were at the Dwight dump, on Oxtounge Rapids Road, just off 60. You can look down on them, as the dump is in the edge of a cliff. Great vantage point, and they won't be far away!"
802795,Rich,2013-08-12 10:15:00,3927,"That's really the only dump you can even get close enough to see them anymore.  We went to a few dumps south of there and they were locked up like fort knox. Way too many people trying to feed the bears, so we were told!"
