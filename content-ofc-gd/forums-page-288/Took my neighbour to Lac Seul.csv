Chad and Jordan were up from down south and were really excited about the chance to fish Lac Seul......it did not disappoint.  The boys scoffed a bit at the size of minnows i revealed to them the morning we were headed out....but after only thirty seconds fishing when i hauled in a 28""er......no longer were 5-6"" sucker and dace minnows ridiculed....they were embraced wholeheartedly as the pickerel waltz ensued!  Things got off to a slow start, but the fish were all slot (18""-21"") and above up to 28"". This gave us the chance to tour a few of my hotspots and take in the scenery on a beautiful day. We got into some smaller ones midway through our 4 hours on the water which filled the cooler nicely.  We decided to return to the first spot we tried as that had produced the best results. Just as we got there the wind picked up enough to get quite a chop on the surface....this sent the big girls into feeding mode and for an hour we got 20""+ walleye non stop....right up to another 30"" for Jordan on his maiden voyage to Lac Seul.......WHAT A GREAT FISHERY IT IS!  All fishing done with 3/8 - 1/2 Oz jigs in various colours in 20'- 45' FOW on or near rock structure.   Here is some footage of some of the fish we caught....not easy to film with 4 in the boat...lots to watch...lol.                                                    Might be getting out to lac suel again on Sunday in someone elses boat....will post if it happens......till then     TIGHT LINES.      "
