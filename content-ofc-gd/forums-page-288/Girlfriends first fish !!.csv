802755,mercman,2013-08-12 00:18:00,7054,"I havent posted a fish in a while, because, well, i havent fished in a while. My girlfriend and I just bought a house together, and we have been really busy feathering our nest. She has never fished before, but has always shown an interest in trying it. Well, this past weekend the timeing was right, and i called my bud Mike Rousseau, and we headed out for a mixed day of Musky and walleye. I had shown Natalie pics of Musky and told her as much as i dared so she wouldnt get scared, but when her rod got hit, she almost jumped out of her seat, Here is her very first fish ever. A fish of a lifetime !!!!!     53 inches of BEAST !!! Now to get a scale, Mike is 6'5"" Natalie is 5'. That fish was 7 inches shorter than her  Sorry for the pic quality, in all the excitement, i didnt realize the sun was in the foreground  Couple of shots, and back she went. Cool water temps made for a quick release, and after trailng her for a few minutes to protect her on the surface while she caught her breath, she swam off back to her lair. I was ecstatic, and my girl friend was shakeing with excitement.Me......Out fished again as usual She like that, but she really had fun with the walleye. She had 5 caught before i caught my first, but all in all we boated 22 walleye and 6 smallies. We kept a limit of good eaters, and released the rest.    By the way....Natalie accepted my marriage proposal back in May, and we are sheduled to wed next June or July. Its never ever too late to find your soulmate !!! Hope you all enjoy this  Paul"
