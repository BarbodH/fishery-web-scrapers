802917,Cudz,2013-08-12 21:52:00,2652,"It was not me.  I got back from the cottage on saturday and have not been out in the boat since. I don't do weekends in the summer on the bay.  I will do the odd SUnday night but not during the day. I might get out tomorrow morning though (going to try and take 2 of my kids, and both of my parents)."

802924,kickingfrog,2013-08-12 22:03:00,8333,"Really? It even looked like your boat.  If I could, I'd only fish during the week as well."
803085,Cudz,2013-08-13 17:40:00,2652,Got out today.  Was going to fish lakers but it was too rough (had the kids with me). Went to the shore and caught a couple little bass and perch.  Still nice to be out on the water. OPP stopped by and did the most thorough check ever.  At one point I thought he was going to get his rubber glove out I had all the documents and equipment. He made me move my lifejackets so they were visible. I had 3 flashlights and 2 whistles but one of my whistles was not peeless so it failed.  He gave me  more fox40s so that was good.
