803105,Joey,2013-08-13 19:18:00,9122,"Found a dead heron while out taking photographs the other evening.  Decided to go back and take the skull, a wing for feathers and a foot.  The skull was pretty picked clean except for a few feather and other icky bits, but I've pretty much got it cleaned up now, just need to get it sun bleached.  The foot need some more ant work, so it's outside getting gnawed on by them.  The feathers are all cleaned up and are nice and big and in great shape.  So for any skull enthusiasts, here is the newest addition to my skull collection, which previously only consisted of a Steer, a deer, a marten and a robin skull.    "
803107,Sinker,2013-08-13 19:24:00,8692,Very cool! Not a skull you see every day!  S.
803112,Roy,2013-08-13 19:53:00,13728,A perch skeleton would look good in there.
803119,Joey,2013-08-13 20:31:00,9122,"Hahahaha Roy, it would indeed!"
803122,dhickey,2013-08-13 20:41:00,1038,Never would have thought.  Sweet find. How bout a musky or pike skull they look cool.
803123,lhousesoccer,2013-08-13 20:45:00,442,"Wouldn't say I'm a collector, but I did make this skull mount of a longnose gar I caught last year.  I thought it came out pretty good.           "
803124,Sinker,2013-08-13 20:51:00,8692,That gar is cool too! I might have to start a new collection!  S.
803129,Bill Shearer,2013-08-13 21:10:00,456,"Not really into the macabre, but I have to admit the gar skull is very cool. Dinosaurs in our lifetime for sure."
803150,kickingfrog,2013-08-13 22:33:00,8333,Sell it on ebay as a pterodactyl skull.
803161,HTHM,2013-08-13 23:21:00,4082,"Why can't you hear a pterodactyl urinate?   The ""P"" is silent.   I kill me..."
803164,kickingfrog,2013-08-13 23:33:00,8333,I thought it was because they had a cloaca.
803165,dhickey,2013-08-13 23:36:00,1038,Hmmmm.  Don't go for the cross bones. That just creeps me out.
