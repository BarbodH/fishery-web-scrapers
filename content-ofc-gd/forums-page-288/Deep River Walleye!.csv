Left Thursday morning and arrived in Deep River around noon. Never fished the area so started asking around for places to stay and most importantly where to fish. We got a room at the Bear Inn (real nice! And reasonable rate) Had lunch, had a nap , then went fishing. A few people suggested Swisha so thats were we started. Caught our first fish around 15 min into our first run and our final tally was 6 fish for the evening. The best time seemed to be around 6-8 and bite slowed after that. I really have no luck (or skill!!) when it comes to fishing for Walleye so thought we did real well for a new place. We caught all the fish on hot pink and chartruce (sorry about spelling, no check!). The next morning was a bit different as we only boated one fish. Had to get home to check on dog so it was short and sweet but am definatly going back!!! A couple of things to note though. First off the ramp off of Swisha road was great and free, i note that because the one in Deep River, on the Ontario side was $6.00. The boat ride was short and sweet as we got most of the fish across from the dock which is about one kilometer. If anyone knows where a good place to hook up with a sturgeon is I would love to experience that, and am all ears!!!"
801021,Rod Caster,2013-07-30 23:45:00,5784,sturgeon is closed  all year on the Ottawa as far as I know...  Good job catching them walleyes...I've always had a tough time figuring out that river except at river inlets or dams.
802526,Waterdawg,2013-08-10 11:36:00,4,"Yes I think your right but I just want to catch one and let it go, not keep it . Im heading back end of August and hope to do some exploration in the mornings as the walleye seem to be evening biters."
802529,Terry,2013-08-10 11:41:00,14456,it is  illegal to intentionally fish for them
802536,Rod Caster,2013-08-10 12:51:00,5784,"ya, don't do that. If the MNR or anyone who knows the regs sees you, they are gonna snap. It won't be like catching an out of season perch, it will be like catching a bottlenose dolfin out of season haha. Seriously, I wouldn't even bother, especially since you've stated your intentions already....if you want sturgeon, hit up the other zones in the north that have an open season or get a status card."
802580,Waterdawg,2013-08-10 16:51:00,4,Ok
