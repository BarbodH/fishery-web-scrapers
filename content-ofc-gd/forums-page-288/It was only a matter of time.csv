802705,misfish,2013-08-11 18:19:00,29133,"It started out a beautiful morning. Calm waters,sun just coming up.Perfect day for fishing.    So we thought. It wasnt for the lack of trying. Only fish we had on,was one that hit my spoon after I released it and it fluttered up from the depths. The word ON,is the only part that happen.No landing.  Many selections of lures were washed.Old and new. Terry was banging my head of the gunnel wells  . It,s all your fault..I in return, was ready to throw him over board for good luck.   Now you tell me what happen   If you seen this all morning,wouldnt you be pulling yer hair out.        This is the first skunk for the new boat. It will be the last.   A pano shot that turned out cool.  "

802708,BillM,2013-08-11 18:33:00,17367,"Probably whities, not lakers."
802711,misfish,2013-08-11 18:44:00,29133," Lots of boats out Bill. We seen no one reefing rods. Riggers or jiggers.   Terry,did the under water vid work?"
802712,Terry,2013-08-11 18:45:00,14456,"crap, I  forgot   to take it off Simulator   I have not checked the vid...still putting the boat away"
802714,Terry,2013-08-11 18:51:00,14456,yeah it's there now half an hour of watching to see if I caught anything
802721,irishfield,2013-08-11 19:51:00,26272,"Probably Herring... take the damn thing off Demo Terry, you showed me the same screen on Tuesday!!"
802722,misfish,2013-08-11 20:06:00,29133,"Thats what I figured too Wayne. Lots of line jumps. Terry did have a good knock off. But,he was slow to get up. He was busy chillaxing.LMAO  That new 9.9 is sweet. It justs purrrrrrs. That dial troll controller,is the cats a  s  s"
802746,BillM,2013-08-11 22:24:00,17367,"Trollmaster is killer, got one in our rig.   Nice to be able to control the kicker without a complete set of controls up front."
802747,muskymatt,2013-08-11 22:30:00,2608,"Wow, that's some pretty awesome screen shots."
802750,davey buoy,2013-08-11 22:52:00,5505,"I'd say,whether there herring,whities or lakers.I hope they are a little more cooperative this coming Sat. Will be my first outing this year!! Still looks like a lot of fun guys!  ."
803032,Twocoda,2013-08-13 03:37:00,4130,fish are scattered ...looks like the Lake turned over...no thermocline = mass confusion for the fish and no one knows what depth the dinner bell is at
