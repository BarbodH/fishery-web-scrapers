802643,AmongU,2013-08-11 02:54:00,10,"Hey Everyone.  Recently made a trip with my Wife, 16 yr old Son & dog with outpostcamps.com  to Abbey Lake in the Chapleau game preserve.  I will try not to repeat info from previous reviewers. But add my 2 cents!  This was a first ever flyin adventure for all of us.  I started to plan for this trip via the web.  Well this is where I found Mike Borger.  Enjoyed a few of his videos on YouTube.   He has a much more thorough & well written report here:  http://ontariofishingcommunity.com/forums/index.php?showtopic=56667&hl=abbey  Made the first contact (email of course) to Martin & Jennifer @ Park’s.  Initially was looking for  Anginami but Abbey was only available.  My Son & I were pumped.  Asked my Wife if she would  join us & she said only if she could bring our lab.  Well Jennifer said it was no problem, so.... We Booked!  Made the drive from London, ON down to Sarnia & crossed into Michigan then north to Sault  Ste. Marie where we spent the night @ a pet friendly hotel (Sleep Inn) actually pretty good if  You pay the advance Internet rate ($120).  Headed the next morning to Wawa where we picked  Up our worms (flat for $60) @ Young’s general store [email protected] then off  to Hawk Junction for our flight.  Martin emailed me that the generator had been malfunctioning for the current group.  I offered to pick one up in Wawa’s Canadian tire & He was onboard for that.  So a little  scramble at the last minute but    We were just in time for our flight.  Hawk air – very professional.  Checked us in & loaded us fast.  Very efficient.  Offered to hold  My car keys.  Pilot was very nice; Lenny I believe. Take offs & landings extremely smooth.   On a  trip back my car was waiting @ the foot of the dock – nice touch!    Arrived @ Abbey Lake, The cabin was everything that Mike Borger….  & Terry http://ontariofishingcommunity.com/forums/index.php?showtopic=55985&st=0&p=610043&fromsearch=1entry610043  & jds63 http://ontariofishingcommunity.com/forums/index.php?showtopic=57301&hl=abbey  & Bronzeback http://ontariofishingcommunity.com/forums/index.php?showtopic=65268&hl=abbey  reported on in their reviews.   Above is a panoramic view of the site from the cabin.  Generator worked great (charged the ipad & ran the magic bullet) Fridge was cold & made solid  Ice! We opted to pump the water from the well drilled on site- treated it with tabs & all was  good. Sattilite radio was a perk.  There were 3 boats & motors – the Gentleman that had stayed  before us said he had an issue with 2 of the motors – I tried the third & worked flawlessly the  whole time.  Plenty of gas/kerosene & mosquitoes! Bring repellant the more deet the better.  The mattress in the cabin are singles and memory foam; very comfortable – I’m a BIG guy &  Usually end up on the boards all night but not so with these- slept great!  Had everything we  needed as far as cooking goes. Cheated a little and brought some paper plates.  Brought a bbq  brush (now there’s 2) still needs a metal spatula for the bbq – there are a short pair of tongs.  Had some fun with the meal plan – and made a pineapple upside down cake in the dutch oven.  (rainy day) and tried Mike Borger’s fish tacos – very good!  We were a little worried the first few days as the rain only allowed us midday fishing –  which was tough; Caught a few pike & a walleye trolling 15ft diving perch like rapala.  Then we were able to get out in the morning & evenings (Terry mention’s this) & WOW  what a difference.  One after another - white head & duo tail jig with orange eye with  worm & the walleye coloured worm harness were best.   http://youtu.be/qlPCYQ9u9WI       We sure didn't have to go far  from the cabin- the rock pile really produced!  Left a laminated copy of a map Mike was  very kind to provide in the cabin alongside another that was there.  It was a great help.  Thanks Mike!    Overall, I would rate Park’s quite high. Very reasonable pricing & Everything they  promise is delivered.  Haven’t been this isolated in a long time.  Felt good to enjoy the quiet.  The stars were  incredible you could definitely see the milky way & shooting stars abound.  I believe my Son & I  have become closer from this trip would recommend to all Dad’s.    Last day was a bit of a scramble as I didn’t expect the plane till about 12:30pm... Well he arrived  about 10am!  (Best to pack most everything the night before.)  Did the drive back all in one shift with a few rest stops along the way.    Had packed some walleye kebobs & a cheese tray in the cooler for the ride.  You guys gotta try these they are fantastic!     Great trip for a total Newbie!  Thanks everyone.  Scott  "
