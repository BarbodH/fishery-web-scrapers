802263,mattybculp,2013-08-08 13:07:00,388,"It was a pretty intense in my neck of the woods in Peterborough last night. I sat out on the front stoop of the house and watched the weather roll in, till the rain really started pounding. Storm of the summer for us! Looking at the clouds you could see the rotation which was neat. It was a great lightening show, and the winds were intense for about 45 minutes or so. Glad to hear everyone was fine!"
802285,DRIFTER_016,2013-08-08 16:02:00,10439, Welcome to tornado alley Raf!! I lived in Grand Valley from 1995 until 2005. We only had one tornado in that time and it was an F3. Came through the marsh heading straight for our house and when it got to the field beside us it hopped across the road and wiped out all the farms and houses over there. We had some minor damage from micro bursts but nothing more serious than a couple of broken trees. After the storm we found a 3# small mouth in the back yard about 20 yards from our pond. My guess is it was picked up out of Damascus reservoir. I wonder if it would have lived it it hit the pond?
802289,SylvanOwner,2013-08-08 16:27:00,266,"That's too funny, kinda brings whole new meaning to food delivery....maybe one did and you just don't know about it"

802333,Sinker,2013-08-08 22:32:00,8692,We watched it from east of you. Quite the light show for sure! Hardly anything around cavan.  S.
802668,Raf,2013-08-11 11:41:00,3495,"in case any of you are into this sorta thing, here's a video of the arthur to grand valley tornado last week as captured by a storm chaser i follow on twitter  "
