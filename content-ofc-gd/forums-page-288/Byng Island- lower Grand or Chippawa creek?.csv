802595,hotsky,2013-08-10 20:13:00,400,I'm looking to go camping this coming week and choseing between Byng Island on Lower Grand in Dunville or Chippawa creek concervation area. I'd be fishing off my campsite  . I've been to Byng last September but never fished the Chippawa creek before. What can I expect to catch there?  Which one would you go to?

802686,danbouck,2013-08-11 13:46:00,4380,I'm not a fan of Byng Island but can't comment on Chippawa.

803060,Rich,2013-08-13 14:04:00,3927,"I'm not a byng fan myself. The upper river can be good as mentioned. Or drop bait right at the dunnville dam for bullheads, sheepies and who knows what else. Never been to chippewa."
803079,northernpike56,2013-08-13 17:13:00,717,"I've been to Byng island a few times myself actually. I remember one year I was there in late May, lets say the third weekend appx, and I was mainly using walleye spinners (erie dearies) tipped with a big fat worm, casting them below the dam. Within about 2 hours, i remember catching at least 5 or 6 channel cats, a bunch of sheephead, a bunch of white bass, one of which was huge, and 2 very large OOS largemouth. Also the two guys that were fishing beside me also caught 2 walleye also on erie dearies."
803081,northernpike56,2013-08-13 17:15:00,717,"Asides from those, i have also caught smallmouth, carp, bullheads, rockbass, perch, and pumpkinseed there mid-summer ie around this time. Using a simple worm and splitshot"
