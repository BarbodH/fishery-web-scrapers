There's a small bass tournament this coming sunday on lake dalrymple, it's $25 per team to enter, 6 fish limit, first 2 teams get paid. There are only 15 teams allowed, all with motors under 80hp and canoes/kayaks. If anyone wants to team up let me know via PM and we can work out details, if you have a proper boat that's great otherwise we'll be using the canoe (with outriggers). Thanks!"
802080,Christopheraaron,2013-08-07 15:19:00,3525,"Bump, if anyone's interested I need to know before the end of tomorrow."
802142,misfish,2013-08-07 21:38:00,29133," This part has me thinking Chris  Canoe,no livewell. Is this a catch and keep or live release? Im thinking it,s a Trailer park tourny."
802149,davey buoy,2013-08-07 21:46:00,5505,Brian they will allow a tuperware container/cooler with air pump from what I've heard.Something like you would use for your fish tank at home.
802157,Christopheraaron,2013-08-07 22:34:00,3525,"yup, live release, most people will have livewells but everyone else will use coolers/rubbermaid bins, I've fished them before and most fish seem to be quite healthy at the weigh in."
802158,Christopheraaron,2013-08-07 22:34:00,3525,I'll have a bait bucket airator with it.
802206,SirWhite,2013-08-08 02:47:00,210,I like your determination. Good luck
802208,Christopheraaron,2013-08-08 03:00:00,3525,"Ok, if anyone wants in I need to know ASAP, the organizer will wait but I don't want to make him. Thanks, Chris."
802212,dhickey,2013-08-08 03:17:00,1038,Sorry bud. If I could . I would go check it out.  If you do find a partner I got a couple lures for you to try.
802213,Christopheraaron,2013-08-08 03:18:00,3525,"Ah, those are the lures you meant, for sure!"
803211,lookinforwalleye,2013-08-14 02:10:00,4399,Did you manage to get in the tourney?
