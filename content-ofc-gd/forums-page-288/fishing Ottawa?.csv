802480,chong,2013-08-10 00:54:00,102,"I'm coming to Ottawa in 2 weeks for the weekend, Is there a place I can fish for bass SM or LM. Do i need an Ontario permit or my Quebec permit is ok??"
802481,irishfield,2013-08-10 00:55:00,26272,The only place you could fish with a Quebec licence would be the Ottawa River and you'd have to be in a boat!
802494,craigdritchie,2013-08-10 01:26:00,1586,If you fish in Ontario then you will need an Ontario license.
802496,irishfield,2013-08-10 01:38:00,26272,Not so Craig.. you can fish the Ontario side of the Ottawa in a boat with a Quebec licence.
802499,darsky,2013-08-10 01:49:00,586,same with the St Lawrence near Lancaster or Ottawa R near Hawksbury
802500,chong,2013-08-10 01:51:00,102,I'm going to be by foot.
802502,irishfield,2013-08-10 01:59:00,26272,Then you'll need an Ontario licence to cover the time period!
802505,chong,2013-08-10 02:20:00,102,"ok for the permit,any place i can fish for bass?"
802510,dhickey,2013-08-10 05:06:00,1038,They are in the water.
802524,Whitespinnerbait,2013-08-10 09:44:00,2038,You can walk along the bike path behind the Parliament buildings and fish from shore........your Quebec permit will be sufficient.!!  Smallmouth can also be caught behind the Museum of civilization. There is also a bike path you can walk along.......   Good luck
802527,chong,2013-08-10 11:38:00,102,DUH??
802528,chong,2013-08-10 11:39:00,102," Thanks,any LM in the river?"
802532,Whitespinnerbait,2013-08-10 12:13:00,2038,"There is a lot of large mouth in the river , but the area you will be fishing has a lot of current so mostly small mouth ."
802717,wallyboss,2013-08-11 19:15:00,1095,"I agree with whitespinnerbait, he can fish the Ottawa River from shore with his Que.License.  If you can find your way down to the bottom of the Rideau Falls, you might be able to catch some walleyes."
802720,irishfield,2013-08-11 19:49:00,26272,"Licences for Provincial Boundary Waters Ontario-Quebec Boundary Anglers may fish in the following waters with either an Ontario Resident Fishing Licence or a Quebec Resident Fishing Licence. • Clarice Lake (48°20’N., 79°32’W.). • Labyrinth Lake (48°14’N., 79°31’W.). • Raven Lake (48°03’N., 79°33’W.). • Lake Timiskaming (47°20’N., 79°30’W.). • Ottawa River (45°34’N., 74°23’W.). • Lake St. Francis (45°08’N., 74°25’W.) and the waters of the St. Lawrence River between the dam at the Robert H. Saunders Generating Station and the Ontario-Quebec boundary.  Yep.. I'll admit I could be wrong. But you'll be standing in Ontario and some CO will find a way to take you to court. All depends what the full regulations state, the guide is just a summary."
802729,Roy,2013-08-11 20:35:00,13728,"Here's another hook. If you're a resident of Quebec AND are over 65 years of age, you can fish anywhere in Canada without a permit (only need proof of age). In Quebec however, you'll need a permit but the generous buggers give you a $4 discount."
802733,misfish,2013-08-11 21:05:00,29133,"  What IF,you catch a salmon in Ontario waters and take it across,Quebec boarders,at the age above 65? is that legal?????"
802872,Bassassins,2013-08-12 18:12:00,111,Ok - so IF you are standing the shore of the Ottawa on the Ontario side you need and Ontario license.  If you are fishing from a boat - which we know you are not but want to take this point so others know - and your CAR is parked or you launched from the Ontario side you STILL need an Ontario license and vise versa.  As far as fishing get your Ontario License and fish for largies in the canal or smallies in the rideau at new edi... Where are you staying? We will help draw you up a little action plan.  Ottawa ROCKs for urban fishing and you will love it!!!
802914,Whitespinnerbait,2013-08-12 21:50:00,2038,YOU DO NOT NEED AN ONTARIO LICENSE TO FISH FROM THE SHORE ALONG  THE OTTAWA RIVER......A QUEBEC LICENSE IS ALLOWED. Several of us have been stopped by a CO in the past !! ALL GOOD !!!
802950,Bassassins,2013-08-12 23:45:00,111,LOL - 3 or 4 times a summer you say right?  Sorry Mr. Whitespinnerbait I didn't realize who was chimming in on this.  Go with what he says - but I still recommend coming up the feeders and fishing them...  :)
803014,chong,2013-08-13 02:35:00,102,Thanks everyone for the info. But i won't be coming to Ottawa  my gf wants to go to quebec city instead.
