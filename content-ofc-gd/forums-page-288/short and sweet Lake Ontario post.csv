Got out this morning with the father in law and youngest brother into Lake Ontario, got up around 5:30 headed out from binbrook by 6 and in the water around 6:30.  Everything went quickly to get setup and we were off, it was slow for the first half hour and then I got one on, hoping for a salmon and after a minute or 2 up I pull, a trout solid first catch 8.5 pounds  from then on it was consistent through to about noon at which time we were getting ready to head on in, the fish had other ideas we were pulling up and as we were, we thought we'd gotten tangled, instead there was a 10 pound laker and a 4 pounder on 2 lines? so we decided to stick around a little bit longer and ended up with...  A 9 pounder for me! I also picked up a 6 pounder with a huge fight to it, didnt get a picture of it though, so all in all great day we ended up getting 9 fish on all to fight another day  "
