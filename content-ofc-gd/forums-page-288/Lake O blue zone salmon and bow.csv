803093,sleded,2013-08-13 18:32:00,96,well lanched out of grimsby around 7 went out to 60 feet dropped riggers and trolled out to the weather marker. Tough moring but we ended up getting 3 salmon and a bow. First nice salmon for me this year got it down 60 ft in 130 ft of water just passed the weather maker. The bow hit 60 ft in 100ft biggest bow i have seen out there looked like a big salmon coming in.
