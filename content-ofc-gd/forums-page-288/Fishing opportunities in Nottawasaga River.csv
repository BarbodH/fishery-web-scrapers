I brought my two rods (and waders) and was hoping to get out for an evening or morning of fishing opportunity.  There is a river here, Nottawasaga, and was thinking about fishing it.  Any access points around here or local spots?   It'll make my work trip that much more bearable.  Not looking for your secret spots.   If you like, you can PM me.   Thanks, Miro"
