Last Saturday my Dad, Uncle and I took off to my favourite lakes for a week of camping and hardcore bass fishing. We had pretty good weather through the week and was the frog bite ever on. Back in June we crushed em and caught lot's of nice big largemouth but not so many numbers. Round 2 was awesome as we caught a few dozen nice largemouth with many in the 2lb class. Good fighting bass. One biggin showed herself later in the week and with a few over 3lbs I was more than happy.  Dad and my uncle got into a few nice fish this trip, the learning curve is growing and they are starting to get the hang of it, as a past guide I have always has a passion to teach family and new anglers the basics and the ways around bass fishing. When you see them hammer some fish its a great feeling.  Alright on with some pictures from out week on the lake.  Froggin in the evening on the first day produced a couple chunky fish for us   The new Bleedin Frog's from the shop, trying some new colours out   Slop bed, one of many...this bed showed a lot of bass but not 1 over 3lbs, shallower mats didn't hold bigger bass we found yet again, lot's of fun tho!!   Dad with the first of our trip   Water levels went down a foot since June, our little hole off the camp...paradise in my eyes popped a few here this week.   Nice morning largie on the sick stick   The bassin machine   Flippin, plastic   Talk about a fight, nice northern from the slop, crushed the frog like a train haha   Big largie on the 3.5"" TRJ, love these things last trip last years trip they always work. Very versitile   Froggie bass   Smaller but fun, this was the ""average"" bass this week. Must be eating well all fish were big and fat.   Every day, quarter to 5 in the morning. I'm running to the first spot   Finally getting the hang of fishing big worms, 10"" with sliding weight, found a few bass in the 18-22ft range this week. Water temps were between 68 and 76 on the hottest day.    And another after a long morning   Another quick largemouth at one of the holes   Dad with a snot rocket   Swimait in the deep, one of the biger ones this week, just over 4   Dad with a football of a largie, first cast one drink of coffee in him. Woke him up pretty quick haha   One spot and over 7 fish in under a hour, love paddling into to untouched slop   Another   One for dad too, this was between 7 and 8am   Largie punchin, trying the skirts on my favourite baits seems to work well   Threw in I missed him, got dad to throw quick and bam perfect setup was stoked for him   Nice bucket in the heavy cover flippin   Another for dad   Just under 4lbs on the popper, bad pic but it wasn't even 5am yet haha   Another on the hinge worm   Skinny pike, slammed the popper awesome fight   Chunky largie for me   Nice bass froggin   3-11, notice the background   Next throw and wham, the lake gave me the piggy I was looking for. Always nice to see a bass over 4   Well thanks for having a look, back to work for a few weeks and come mid september well be in for round 3.  Tightlines guys and gals!  MTBF"

Lot's of baitfish too, saw a few frog leg's and heads in the back's of throat's this week it's crazy.  Let's see em!! Weather was certainly nice"
