802530,Waterdawg,2013-08-10 11:50:00,4,Was planning on heading out to deseronto this weekend for an evening fish but not sure if walleye are biting. Has anyone had any luck and if yes what areas are you trying? I live on loughborough lake and its been pretty slow for me the last two weeks. ?Thanks in advance for any tips.

Fish the south shore if Mohawk bay along the east/west weed bed in and around 12-20ft it's a great spot or troll or jig the trench and shelf out from foresters island !!!! And cause its quinte you never know what you will catch there's big pike around there too so be prepared  good-luck    Cheers
