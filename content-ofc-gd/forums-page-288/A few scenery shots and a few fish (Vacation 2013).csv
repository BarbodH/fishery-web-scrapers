We have had the pleasure of renting in the Bancroft area, Big Rideau lake on an island, PEI(saweeeet) and this year, the Thousand Islands just west of Gananoque. WOW, what a beautiful area. I have been fishing the Larry for about 10-12 years now, but most of the time was spent looking at a GPS/Sonar rather than the scenery. This year was different. We spent 7 days relaxing, swimming, skiing, tubing, relaxing, fishing, playing games, having fires and did I say relaxing...lol.  here is a few pics of the area            "
