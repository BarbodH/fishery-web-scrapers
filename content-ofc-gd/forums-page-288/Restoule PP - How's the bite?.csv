801827,Stoty,2013-08-06 01:19:00,2910,Anyone been fishing Restoule/Stormy/Clear lakes recently? How's the bite for bass/walleye/pike? What's the water temp?  Any info is much appreciated!
801830,chrispyke,2013-08-06 01:29:00,51,"Was on the french river side of Restoule Rapids a couple days ago.  Water temp around 72 - 73.  A few Pike on spinners, some small smailles, but no walleye in the 30' holes.  May not be you exact area of interest, but gives you some info."
801832,atvaholic,2013-08-06 01:39:00,271,I fished stormy a few weeks back. Had some t-storms whilst up there and didn't do very well. Hope you have better luck...
801837,Stoty,2013-08-06 02:47:00,2910,Thanks for the replies gents.
801845,bow slayer,2013-08-06 03:50:00,1074,"got back about 2 weeks ago,fishing was hit and miss,if you hit it,it was nuts,lots smallies,pike and walleye,not much musky action...headed back up in a week"
802018,msp,2013-08-07 02:11:00,1336,I will be up there from Thursday to Sunday this week. I will let you know how I make out

Plenty of cover and structure, and your skills are no doubt better than mine, should have success."
802048,Stoty,2013-08-07 10:23:00,2910,"Thanks for the reply Dave, however I will have my Nitro with me. That might be a little heavy to portage."

802160,solopaddler,2013-08-07 22:44:00,8605,Some pretty good and underfished Musky in Restoule. Good enough that if I was going Musky would be my target species of choice.
802779,Dan668,2013-08-12 03:13:00,1120,"How did you do? Seen your truck there, i left on friday. Was slower than last year. Landed a few ski's, biggest being 36"", all small guys. Managed to land two 20.5"" smallies ~5lbs minutes from each other which was pretty awesome. Surprisingly the fish were pretty chunky, lots of bass in the 17-18"" all over stormy."
802846,msp,2013-08-12 16:07:00,1336,"Hey guys, I was up there from Thursday to Sunday with limited time to fish. Never fished there before this weekend. Fished a total of 5 hrs. 1 hour on Restoule and 4 hrs on Clear. 1 hr on Restoule and boated 3 decent smallies ( my son got his first smallie on a top water ) and had a 8- 10 pound musky slash my jerk bait 4 hrs on Clear Lk.  The wife gave me a pass to fish for 4 hrs on Sat. Boated a 10 pound musky in the first 10 min of fishing and thought it was going to be a killer day. Figured that the bite was on, I targeted musky with big baits and raised 2 nice muskies to the boat. Nothing else. Nice looking lake. Beautifull park. Not sure if I will be back anytime soon. I can see the potential for great fishing. A little far to travel IMO"
