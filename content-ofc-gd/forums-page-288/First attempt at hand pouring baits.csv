803099,landry,2013-08-13 19:05:00,1005,"I made some plaster of Paris molds and re melted some old plastics to try and hand pour my some drop shot baits. It went well but I need an old microwave and a great mask cause this stuff is nasty and toxic I am gonna clone and design some drop shot and paddle tail baits this winter - just wanted to do a test run before I ordered plastisol, glitter, colour... I will not be selling these and I know they r copies. I plan on doing my own design with plastic end or sculpey. Just wanted to share. Landry "

803134,Richie Razor,2013-08-13 21:18:00,536,"Nice, look pretty good! Whats the difference in cost do you think to make one of those compared to say a X-zone type or Berkley? Also do you plan on adding scent?"
803145,Cudz,2013-08-13 22:26:00,2652,cool. love that colour
803147,landry,2013-08-13 22:31:00,1005,"Making the plaster mold and coating with 50/50 wood glue mix costs next to nothing and was easy. If I pick it up in the states my order of plastisol, color, flake and alumidust powder paint will be under 200$. Apparently a gallon of plastisol will make over 700 senkos so it should make a 1000 drop shot style baits. That's $0.20 a bait. Colors, flakes... Add up in cost but that will be the fun part:) Slammers, jackall, Yamamoto and set the hook dropshot baits are all at least 0.80 each. My plan is to make my own version and tweak the softener and salt content to get my own horizontal bait. Plus it will be fun. I am new to this so we will see how it goes. I enjoy fly tying and rod building and paint a little so this is right up my alley. Landry"
803148,landry,2013-08-13 22:32:00,1005,And I do plan on bagging them with a little lake fork craw scent.
803156,Djeep,2013-08-13 23:03:00,199,some sweet looking plastics. cant beat the price and i bet itl be fun to create new designs too.
803158,MJL,2013-08-13 23:10:00,2427,"Totally awesome! The baits came out great  I've been looking into making soft plastics of my own for my trips to BC (pink worms, artificial egg clusters, etc). Finding unscented and unflavoured baits locally is tough. Soft-plastics with scent constitutes to being bait out west - Not so great for rivers with a bait ban."
803221,landry,2013-08-14 03:58:00,1005,Thanks guys!
803232,Ice Fishing Ham,2013-08-14 08:40:00,83,Nice work Landry.
803247,Garnet,2013-08-14 11:48:00,2056,I got my micro wave from yard sale $5 and a range fan for $7.  I to have no interest in producing baits that are readily available.  My goal is a bait that catches large and smallies equally and can be rigged many ways. So far I'm still semi retired tournament guy.
803264,landry,2013-08-14 13:49:00,1005,What plastic are you using Garnet?
803265,Garnet,2013-08-14 13:58:00,2056,I bought mine from Bass Magnet before they move to injection so it's no longer available.  I tried re melting old baits you just don't get the consistency.
803290,landry,2013-08-14 16:12:00,1005,Thanks.
803300,Garnet,2013-08-14 16:55:00,2056,Gravity molds just don't work that well.  A friend made injector from air cylinder (princes auto). After we got heat resistant seals it worked great for more complex baits.
803302,Old Ironmaker,2013-08-14 17:00:00,8243,"Landry,  I have a Comfo 2 respirator with type2 cartridges  that I am never going to use again, you can have it if you figure a way for me to get it to you. I am in Selkirk On that is on the north shore of Erie south of Caledonia and 50 minutes from the outskirts of Hamilton,  I'll bring it to the post office and find out the weight for shipping, or if you know someone in the Hamilton area I can get it to.  For what you're doing the cartridges will last you a lifetime.  Let me know if you want it.  Johnny D"
803305,crappieperchhunter,2013-08-14 17:22:00,2582,One of the things I have always loved about this site. Good on you for the generous offer
803311,lookinforwalleye,2013-08-14 18:05:00,4399,At 20 cents a piece I will take a couple hundred!!! Where do I send the check???
803357,landry,2013-08-14 22:20:00,1005,Jonny B That is very generous of u. I will pm u Thanks Landry.
803430,Garnet,2013-08-15 14:35:00,2056,Spray your mold with your chosen scent Oil base (not water). Gets the scent process going.  Water and plastisol  gets ugly quick.
