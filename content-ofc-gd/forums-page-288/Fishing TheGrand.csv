I used to fish the area from Caledonia to Cayuga  in my younger days but haven't been out there in years.  Caught most of my fish around York and a bit towards Caledonia, (particularly the old dam),  and Cayuga (upriver) The old girl has changed somewhat since then, and now with more time on by hands, would like to try it again. Thanks"

Mostly caught silver bass although I remember being surprised once by reeling in two gar-pike in 30 minutes. Yeah, a couple dozen worms, maybe a pail of crayfish would keep a guy going most of the day. Might go out this week and see if some of the old haunts are still accessible."
