800845,Moosebunk,2013-07-30 01:41:00,3970,"You're awesome with that camera Joey.  Thought those baby gar shots were slick.  Some great times had by all I'm sure, and congrats on your boy's first ski and a fish getting caught on your super lure."
800922,quickme,2013-07-30 13:56:00,261,Those are some Amazing photos!  Great job capturing the fun times and the beauty of your surroundings.   Nick
800963,davey buoy,2013-07-30 19:08:00,5505,"Looks like good times again Joey!,great report and pics."
801031,MJL,2013-07-31 00:28:00,2427,Great report Joey! Really loving all the bird pictures. It's hard to choose which one is my favourite
801037,danbouck,2013-07-31 01:02:00,4380,Awesome report! Too bad you didn't get to try any of Art and Joe's jerky but I am glad they left it at Spiel's... it was great!
801049,Daplumma,2013-07-31 02:04:00,1961,Dan....You suck!
801083,John,2013-07-31 11:27:00,2956,"Yep that was awesome jerky Dan, glad you and Spiel left me a few pieces... :-)"
801154,Joey,2013-07-31 21:31:00,9122,"Yes, we heard about the jerky.  I think Spiel hid it on purpose   Thanks again everyone.  Still tired from the trip, but it was worth it.   Can't wait to get up there again.  Every time I go, I find a new bird that I have never seen before.  That's pretty cool!"
801158,lew,2013-07-31 21:57:00,12766,But you haven't met my pet Lakair swan yet Joey  
801159,Roy,2013-07-31 22:00:00,13728,"I could tell by Spiel's voice on the speaker phone up there that he KNEW about the ""missing"" jerky. However, Joe and Art gave me some of their 'can't be beat' poulet gumbo that J and I had Monday night and it was great! Thanks guys."
801161,aplumma,2013-07-31 22:16:00,6896,Glad you enjoyed it. Few things taste as good as Cajun Gumbo or our signature red beans and rice.   Art
801162,misfish,2013-07-31 22:23:00,29133,"Now thats good eats.I cant fill my face enough of that stuff . Just need a piece of oyster,from the jerk chicken to go with it.LOL"
801170,aplumma,2013-07-31 23:33:00,6896,You are correct Brian you are the only person outside of my family that has that recipe guard it well.   Art
801220,Old Ironmaker,2013-08-01 07:59:00,8243," I'm painting the fantastic pic of the wooden boats today Joey, if you are OK with that?  What fantastic balance and composition!"
801309,Joey,2013-08-01 19:08:00,9122,"  No I haven't Lew, I guess my sandwiches are not as good as yours hahahahah!      Had the red beans and rice the other day, it was delish, Thanks!!     Wow, neat, I'd love to see the finished product!"
802265,Billy - Curtiss,2013-08-08 13:13:00,241,"Joey, this sounds like a really great time! I'd love to get back up to Lakair again. Your photos are simply stunning. What kind of camera setup are you using? Or is that highly guarded, top-secret information?!"
802298,highdrifter,2013-08-08 17:34:00,2534,Perfect lunch hour viewing material Joey!  Much obliged me lady..  cheers
802402,Joey,2013-08-09 12:27:00,9122,"  Hi Billy, you will definitely have to come up again, and bring your partner in crime Fidel with you.  That was a blast last time you two joined us up there!!!  The camera is a Canon 60D with a Canon 100 - 400mm EF IS Zoom lens on it.  Been really enjoying it!!!"
802406,TroutnMuskieHunter,2013-08-09 12:59:00,1362,What a great report and awesome photos Joey! Looks like everyone had a good time.
802778,pidge,2013-08-12 03:09:00,438,"Thanks for sharing. I enjoyed looking at you pics. Very nice and clear. I did like the pic of the gar pike, that was neat."
802791,spincast,2013-08-12 09:12:00,3279,looks like a great time. Those shots of the mink are awesome  Thanks for sharing
802864,highdrifter,2013-08-12 17:12:00,2534, BC...  I'm a big jerk..  I'll send ya a pm.  The distance is killing me dude.
800536,Joey,2013-07-28 17:30:00,9122,"We had planned to go back up to Lakair for a week with Roy and J again this year, and take my son Alan along as he had such a great time last year.  Art and Joe joined us again and Rich hopped aboard much to our delight!!  The weather changed from blistering hot and humid to a nice, sunny low to mid 20's for the week we were there, which was just fine by all of us.  We started our trek up on Saturday morning and traffic was pretty slow, and then we found out why.  This guy was having a bad drive for sure:       Traffic was a bit better after that, except for the usual morons who go real slow, then speed up when you come to a passing zone   Rich pulled in shortly after we got there and Paul and Alan helped launch the boat.    Apparently they were not very good first mates as a short while later, Rich realized a very important detail to launching a boat had been overlooked     Hey, we've all done it before!!     Rich relaxing by the fire pit     Rich was kind enough to offer to take my son Alan out so we were two in each boat.  It worked out great and Alan made a new friend this trip.  Thanks so much Rich!      Roy and J arrived on Monday afternoon and got settled in and we had some laughs on the deck.           Tuesday was very windy and we decided to fish from the dock while waiting for Art and Joe to arrive      Buddies     Art and Joe arrived safely and launched the boat      TJ and Monique even showed up for a dinner one night, Ribs!!!    And we spent a few nights inside due to the mosquitoes, but had a great time nevertheless.    Ralphie loves it up there and got lots of attention.  He also got lots of bug bites, but then so did all of us.      Sooo, on to the fishing:  Paul with a nice 46"" er and the release. Caught with one of my homemade lures too   Ralphie was interested in the release part and watched with interest.            Alan got a really nice pickerel, but it was in the slot.    Then he got his first musky, a nice 37"" er.  Now he's hooked     Paul and I with a pike double header    Dink perch instead of our target pickerel      Some pike, of which we caught in excess of 50, and some random in the boat shots               On to some wildlife shots.  Here is a baby gar having lunch.  It was cool to watch it turn the minnow around in it's mouth to swallow it.        This little mink came right up to me while I was taking pictures.  I also found it later eating a frog on the dock.        Supper time!!!!        Check out the teeth!!      Then we had this snake go after a large leopard frog.  The frog got away much to Ralphie's delight.  He had never seen a frog before and wanted to play.  The frog did not           continued........"
800537,Joey,2013-07-28 17:30:00,9122,"A hard day of fishing for Ralphie, and his lower eye got swollen this time.  Both eyes swelled up either top or bottom from mosquitoes each night.  We may have to go in August instead of June or July so he doesn't get so bug bitten.    Another Frog     Then we had a bunch of ducks come jump on the dock, and for some reason, they all took off the dock real fast later one, wonder why                 So, now onto my bird pics.  Sorry if there are alot, but I enjoy finding and photographing them.   BIRD!!!!!!                                                                     Some other random shots and some sunsets                         So once again, it was a pleasure going up there.  Leslie and Kevin run a top notch lodge.  Thanks for the company and laughs Rich, Roy, J, Joe, Art and for a fleeting moment, TJ and Monique!!  Lets do it all again next year"
800539,Rich Clemens,2013-07-28 17:39:00,3131,"It was a great time with everyone.  Laughs - yeah, quite a few.  Hey - somebody has to do something stupid to get the laughs going.   Great to see everyone again."
800541,misfish,2013-07-28 17:43:00,29133,Wow what a great report J. The pics as always superb.  This one tells time IMO. Great shot.    Thanks for taking the time to post. Great people to hang with.
800543,Sinker,2013-07-28 17:54:00,8692,"Looks like a great trip guys! Joey, your photos are awesome! love the wildlife shots, and I agree with Brian, the boat shot is awesome!  S."

800562,Handlebarz,2013-07-28 19:38:00,3790,Awesome report Joey I sure do need to get back up there but where is the time of day to do it. Thanks for taking the time to put the report together
800573,lew,2013-07-28 20:17:00,12766,"Fantastic Joey, I've been wondering all week how you guys were making out up there and your tale didn't disappoint. Congrats to Paul on the nice musky and to Alan for his 1st.  As usual, your pictures are outstanding, was the eagle the one that hangs out at Aikenheads ??  Hope you & Paul can get back up with Diane and I in a couple weeks.  BTW, did you get the goodies that Diane left for you ??"
800588,Joey,2013-07-28 21:18:00,9122,"Thanks all, we had a blast.  Yes Lew, there were two at Aikenheads, they flew by and landed way down at the south end, then one flew back.  Had his mouth open the whole time for some reason.  It wasn't that hot so i wondered why?  Yes, got the goodies and they are pretty much gone now.  Thanks so much and give Di a big hug for making and bringing them for me."
800591,Tim Mills,2013-07-28 21:50:00,476,Impressive photography and fishing thanks for sharing glad your family had fun
800611,aplumma,2013-07-29 00:03:00,6896,"While the photos were great it was the people who came that shines in my eyes. Thanks to everyone who made this another special trip up North . Rich you tried ( as well as Lew last year )but I have beaten both of you and remain muskie free. Spiel Thanks for the bed and friendship you have shown us over the years the Musky Rod you built for me is great but the fenwick is a work of art for sure.. Fish farmer thank you for your yearly visit you are a class act for sure. Joey Paul and Allen  you all made the trip special with your company and open arms. Roy and Miss J  as always it was a pleasure to see you both the food was excellent and while Miss J spoke little English her eyes were filled with joy the whole time. Maureen thanks for taking the time and effort to drive out for a day of fun and fishing. A trip up North is not complete until T.J. and Monique comes to visit. Thanks you both for making the trip even though you both felt bad you made it special. As always the Lak Air Lodge did not disappoint it was excellent as always the rooms are comfortable the fishing grand and the people who run the lodge made every effort to make sure we had every thing we wanted in a timely manner.  Until next year, we love you Canada   Art"
800613,Jds63,2013-07-29 00:16:00,1365,great report and your photography is superb !
800623,wormdunker,2013-07-29 01:55:00,1711,"You're not really a fisher lady?   You're a photographer disguised as a fisherman(lady)!!  Your pix are awesome!!  The shot of the humminbird was great!  You must have an expensive camera.  How far away were you to ""shoot"" the hummingbird?"
800627,corvette1,2013-07-29 02:06:00,1765,awesome trip and photo's
800629,Daplumma,2013-07-29 02:14:00,1961,"Awesome pics Joey.Its almost like I was there!The food,the friends and the accommodations were as good as it gets.The fishing was better than it has been,tons of pike especially the last two days.No monsters but a steady stream of toothy critters was welcome.Congrats to Al on his first.Good to see Maureen , even if it was only for a few hours.Thanx for the good times again!"
800640,Joey,2013-07-29 03:08:00,9122,"  Hahaha, I'll take that compliment  The hummingbird was only about 10 feet away.  First time shooting them.  I didn't realize how fast they move when you are trying to photograph them, and how odd they act with other hummingbirds.  Doing little dances etc.  It was cool.   Thanks so much everyone.  Been tired here all day trying to get back to normal, but all that sun, long days and laughter wore me right out.  Lets do it all again real soon"
800653,lew,2013-07-29 09:59:00,12766," I'm leaving in 13 days for another 2 weeks up there Art and there's plenty of room in the boat for you, c'mon back up"
