802642,landry,2013-08-11 02:49:00,1005,"When u go - #18 isopods, green caddis larva with brown head and and pheasant tails are killer there. If u pm me i will send u some pics and recipes. Tailgaters are known for having great numbers of small mayflies. Most on the bottom of rocks are #18 or smaller. The river is loaded with caddis, mayflies and scuds(isopods). The cedar run area just upstream of the ferguson arena/community centre (on bend of road) is a great place to start. The run is immediately above the path to river at the big willow tree. Nymph fish it. There are some monsters there. I used to fish the upper river 30 days a year befor I got married and had kids:) The river fishes much better in May and June as it gets a good bloom later and the best hatches are in those months.
