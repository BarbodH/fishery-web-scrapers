802520,fishindevil,2013-08-10 09:09:00,6254,Well I have been very busy chasing bass around this summer and I made a point if fishing lots of different lakes this summer so far I have fished 13 different lakes !!!!! And learned lots of new spots some lakes were new to me some were not and a few are now on my favorites list for sure !!!! Most trips were solo but I do have a few pics of some decent bass !!! It's been a different season for sure and some lakes were hard to figure out but I just stayed at it and worked it !!!!
