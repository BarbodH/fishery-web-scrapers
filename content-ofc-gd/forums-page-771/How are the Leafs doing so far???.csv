396118,muskymatt,2009-10-25 01:57:00,2608,Any updates??  My tv's out ...what was the score??  Did they win??
396120,danbouck,2009-10-25 02:00:00,4380, Do you have to ask?  They lost
396121,muskymatt,2009-10-25 02:01:00,2608,Aww..that's too bad!
396126,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-10-25 02:35:00,0,sens choked huge tonight!  eff off!
396154,Paully,2009-10-25 11:17:00,712,Whats the differance between the Leafs and a triangle...                   .... A triangle has 3 points.
396156,dave524,2009-10-25 11:28:00,4508,Hamilton didn't even get a team and they're still only 1 point behind the Leafs.
396157,Bernie,2009-10-25 11:29:00,3190,"Even the team in Hamilton (that should exist- cheer on Basilli) is tied with the Leafs. Bettman is an idiot, why shun a guy with money that wants to put in a team that MAKES MONEY !"
396158,MCTFisher9120,2009-10-25 11:39:00,3761,Leafs played a good strong defensive game with more than enough offensive pressure. Luongo just didn't let up in the 3rd. If we see this again against a weaker goalie and a win will come out.  Good game for on the road.
396182,Twocoda,2009-10-25 14:33:00,4130,to be a leafs fan you have to brush up on your excuses...   SHINE FLAMES SHINE
396431,anders,2009-10-26 14:40:00,1168, Wasnt that beautiful...I Love It!!
396453,Governator,2009-10-26 15:24:00,879,For what it's worth the leafs can still finish the season with an nhl record 150pts.
396687,jediangler,2009-10-27 04:55:00,1923,"Well they finally won a game. First win since April 11/09, 6-3 win over the Ducks. They scored 5 of their goals on the PP, 3 of which were with a two man advantage. The refs were wearing their Leaf jerseys underneath their stripes. Some of the worst officiating I've seen this season. Start planning the parade route again .  What does a triangle and the Leafs have in common?  They both have 3 points."
396688,ADB,2009-10-27 05:10:00,444,"Great win.  They looked a lot more confident in front of the Monster.  As Jedi said, hard not to win considering all the PPs.  I'm still a bit concerned that they can't score playing 5-5.  Nevertheless, hopefully this will be the confidence boost they need to put some into the Win column."
396699,muskymatt,2009-10-27 11:01:00,2608,"Well it makes sense after the memo sent out by Gary Bettman yesterday morning. I was a bit shocked but figured the league would have to step in sooner or later..  Attention officiating staff for Leafs Ducks game  I find it incredibly difficult to deal with the Pheonix issue at hand with the embarrassment and distraction the Leafs present as being the only team in the league without a win. At this time it's in the best interests of all parties that we ""level"" the playing field. Therefor during tonights match up I would like to see as many 5 on 3's as possible, 5 on 4's will also do but in the event of a mass of short handed goals by the Ducks further intervention will be needed. How do you expect me to screw up the rest of the league with the Leafs grabbing the headlines? It's not fair.  G.B."
396708,Whitespinnerbait,2009-10-27 11:52:00,2038," $64 ,000 dollar question right there.....  Why do '' Adults '' making million s of dollars a year need a Confidence Boost.."
396711,PikeMolester,2009-10-27 12:30:00,428,obviously this thread is ignored for the whole time they are winless...then they win ONE game and  WOW the thread is back to life and you guys are talking about the leafs again after hiding for the last 2 weeks LOL
396720,ADB,2009-10-27 12:55:00,444," I would hardly argue that any of the guys who are 25 or less are adults.  You can't build any life experience when from the time you were 5 years old you spent every free minute at a hockey rink.  Besides, what does their salary have to do with their confidence?  If anything, it makes them more self-conscience considering the very fans who allow them to be paid so much will berate them if they make one mistake.  They may have job security, but there aren't many professions where your day-to-day work is PUBLICALLY scrutinized."
396724,Jer,2009-10-27 13:10:00,1426,"  ...yeah, that's why they missed the elbow to Gustavson's head on the 1st Ducks goal..."
396774,Whitespinnerbait,2009-10-27 16:15:00,2038,  Ahhh..  Boo Hoo Hoo.........
396777,Governator,2009-10-27 16:23:00,879,"  Uhmm.. No it wasn't?...   Anyway it's a good thing they pulled through last night. Considering the Ducks spent half the game in the box, if the Leafs didn't notch a victory from that they would've let a lot of fans down. Thankfully they did what any NHL team should do in those cases and took full advantage.  You can't blame the Leafs for the reffing.  They outplayed them 5 on 5 just as much as the power plays.  They've been playing great the last few games and they were bound to get some breaks sooner or later.  They outplayed the nucks the game before and would've won that game too if it wasn't for Luongo."
396930,jediangler,2009-10-28 02:10:00,1923,"Hey Jer, didn't you see Exelby drive him into the crease?"
396965,muskymike,2009-10-28 03:11:00,772,"  Okay, so we should start the parade at Front and Spadina, head straight up through China Town, swing down up College, through Queens Park, Down Bloor to Jarvis, down towards the lake, on to the Gardiner, all the way up to the 401. Lets shut down the DVP for the celebrations.  Who's with me?"
392835,PikeMolester,2009-10-14 05:30:00,428,ya the riot was last year LOL and the year before..after winning game ONE! not even series 1. just 1 game
392845,Whitespinnerbait,2009-10-14 10:56:00,2038,How are the leafs doing ??????    Their right on pace for another disastrous season .....
392846,Whitespinnerbait,2009-10-14 10:59:00,2038,  
392850,jaydub,2009-10-14 11:31:00,145," Wow, you are an optimist man!  First of all, they've been in ""rebuilding"" mode   for what seems like forever.  That phrase is getting REALLY old.  Second, if they are in ""rebuilding"" mode (for two seasons you say) why did Burk just trade away two first round and one second round draft picks?    He must be hoping to get to the playoffs this year but if they don't pickup a win soon it's gonna be an aweful tough uphill climb.  Go JAYS...I mean ARGOS !!!!  HaHaHa  Sports team in this city SUCK right now.  P.S.  I was at the game last night (don't get mad at me the tickets were free) and it was great to see the standing ovation for Tucker!  Now that guy knows when to draw a penalty...this goon Orr just comes out his first shift every game, picks a fight and   opps were down 1 nothin early folks!!"
392851,bushart,2009-10-14 11:33:00,2628,It is the media driven blue team machine---finite  I would not be suprised to hear discussions on TSN or Sports net go something like this......  Wow Bob that was some Tsunami that hit the south Pacific Huh?.......Wonder how this will affect the Leafs chances to make the playoffs...  or how about the commercials where they show Leafs scoring on Sens and or Habs to that rockin beat.  How's about the biggest attention grab in the last 5 years----the leafs were going to change teams with Edmonton in the Gretzky era---yea right!  Even the Mike Myers Love Guru was a bomb----possibly cause he hitched his wagon to the Leafs.  This could go on and on  Centre of the universe I believe is a black hole (Or blue)  Bushart
392878,Mike Pike,2009-10-14 13:08:00,1332,A Sens fan making fun of the Leafs.   Hah hah hah... good one.
393577,siwash,2009-10-16 03:13:00,683,  about as bad as the habs  hahahaha  habs suck... another loss... 5 losses in my books cause that win against the Leafs was a fluke..totally outplayed
393579,siwash,2009-10-16 03:15:00,683,  you had 7 players on th ice and you still couldn't score  SMURFS Suck
393598,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-10-16 04:36:00,0,"sens won again! habs, not! and the leafs, well, we won't talk about them right now."
393602,holdfast,2009-10-16 05:08:00,1813,"Worst Division in Hockey, unfortunately anyone that wants to see an Eastern Canadian team do something in the Playoffs may be out of luck.  When are the Habs going to learn that you cannot play a European type Game with small players.  Unless they are building for the future, banking on that the Anti-fighting and Hitting Crazies get their way.  But its got to spread West and South to the States."
393631,blaque,2009-10-16 12:38:00,2419,My Sabres are 3-0-1...........their latest win being over the Wings 6-2.......yet that one overtime loss came to the Red White and Blue habs?????? Somebody make up an excuse for me as to how that happened lol!!!  Just finding out they've lost every game but Buffalo and Toronto by reading this thread.  How is it a team with a lucky horseshoe for a logo can have such little success
393651,anders,2009-10-16 13:37:00,1168,  Its not a horseshoe...its a toilet seat
393694,John the Fisherman,2009-10-16 15:20:00,45,What's the difference between a cigarette vending machine and the Leafs?     The vending machine has Player's  JTF
393742,blaque,2009-10-16 19:06:00,2419," Ha, all these years and i never saw it"
393749,jimmer,2009-10-16 19:53:00,2730,"Sorry, but Nash signed long term with Columbus.  I always believed that he would consider coming to TO when he became a free agent (my hopes anyways).  However, between the media and various forum attacks on the Leafs, I don't see how the team can attract any worthwhile free agents.  What player in their right mind would want to live under a microscope, when they can go to Columbus, make millions and remain unknown. A true fan! Go Leafs Go!"
393759,jediangler,2009-10-16 20:30:00,1923,Kessels favourite center Marc Savard is free agent this summer and with the cap going down by possibly as much as 10 million Boston will not try to resign him.

394212,Rizzo,2009-10-19 00:38:00,4754,"the fans in Boston must be ecstatic about how crap the leafs are. I know I would be if one of the worst teams in the league gave me their next 2 first rounders - seriously, would anyone in their right mind make this trade? I would do it for a top 10 player in the league...but not for a guy who had one good season, and that playing with a fantastic set-up man in Savard"
394230,Twocoda,2009-10-19 01:20:00,4130,i heard the leafs are going to sign Elvis Stoiko...but i dont think it will help the cause ...cuz he cant play hockey either  ....maybe they should take the year off !! ha ha ha

394486,Jonny,2009-10-19 21:04:00,1380,"Another case of truth being stranger than fiction...  TORONTO, ONTARIO (CP) -  A seven-year-old Toronto, Ontario boy was at the center of a Toronto city courtroom drama yesterday when he challenged a court ruling over who should have custody of him.  The boy has a history of being beaten by his parents & the judge initially awarded custody to his aunt, in keeping with child custody law & regulations requiring that family unity be maintained to the degree possible. The boy surprised the court when he proclaimed that his aunt beat him more than his parents & he adamantly refused to live with her. When the judge then suggested that he live with his grandparents, the boy alleged they had also beat him. After considering the remainder of the immediate family & learning that domestic violence was apparently a way of life among them, the judge took the unprecedented step of allowing the boy to propose who should have custody of him. After two recesses to check legal references & confer with child welfare officials, the judge granted temporary custody to the Toronto Maple Leafs, whom the boy firmly believes are not capable of beating anyone."
394533,Twocoda,2009-10-19 23:08:00,4130,Well said Jacko...

392655,BUSTER,2009-10-13 20:56:00,1336,"Well most of them have fallen off the tree up here , give it a couple more weeks and they'll all be on the ground, like usual."
392663,siwash,2009-10-13 21:31:00,683,It's Oct 13... don't get to happy about the Leafs losing  They're much better than what you see..  Just rewind to game against Mtl. That is the real Leaf team... and they fully deserved that game   They're trying to get Toskola going so they can trade him. He stinks but Macdonald is SOLID and the new swede MIGHT be ok.  They have a top-five D that is playing like crap.  They will get better... Post again in 6 weeks...
392665,JohnF,2009-10-13 21:34:00,3494," As a dyed in the wool Leafs fan I can answer you, honestly, in one word - theysuckbutarecertaintogetbettercuzthatistheonlywaytheycangorightnow  Last night I was so frustrated with their abysmal performance that I changed the channel to a rerun of StarWars. At least Luke Skywalker is still a hero at the end of his 2 1/2 hours of tv time.  Teeter Kennedy et al could probably come back to the ice and do a better job, even dead.  JF"
392671,JohnF,2009-10-13 21:41:00,3494," You're right, but then you're probably a lot younger than me, most are, and you haven't had all the years of disappointment and frustration. We'll all come back to the fold when they win a game though, whenever that might be. My problem is that I'm already into my 60's and they're on a pace to bury me winless right now. Us oldtimers know better than to expect perfection, or even a Cup, or even a division championship and a run at the Cup. We'd settle for one win in a row right now.  JF"
392673,jediangler,2009-10-13 21:43:00,1923,"Toskala ranked 45th out of 47 goalies last year. MacDonald ranked 46th. Exelby and Komesarik are penalty machines and Beauchimen only looks good playing along side Neidermayer. Burke builds a team that would be at home in 1975 and trades away 2 first rounders and a second rounder for a little speedster that won't hit and will be lucky to play 40 games a year. Wilson is a good coach but has very litle to work with, it's not his fault but he will probably be fired by x-mas to save Burkie's job. Kaberle will gladly wave his no-trade this year to get out of town since the team is so bad. Only Stajan and a couple of youngsters on the Marlies show any promise and will probably be trade bait to get another goalie. I heard Burke's old buddy from Anaheim, J.S.Giguere is on the block. No matter, next year around the end of September, the Leaf fans will once again be plotting out the parade route after a steller pre-season."
392719,Radnine,2009-10-13 23:13:00,1538," Most sensible thing I have read thus far (with all due respect to all others) on this topic. I can't believe that there still are any fans. I mean we all watch because they are jammed down our throat every Saturday night by Leafs TV oops, I mean CBC. How come Don Cherry loves to show clips of himself predicting things that come true, but has never shown the clips where he says the Leafs will make the playoffs (and he does every year)? And is it written in the contract of the CBC that they must promote the Leafs? I mean to hear Craig Simpson ask Glen Healy ""what do they need to do Glen (to pull this one out of the bag)?"" When there is obviously no answer that anyone could possibly say, because the only real answer is ""nothing"". Watching the Leafs and all of the TV salesmanship that goes with them is an insult to everyones intelligence. But to play the ""all they need to do is trade so-and-so"", or, ""if only Wendall were still here, etc."" is nothing short of daft. Sorry Jim"
392728,Dutchy,2009-10-13 23:34:00,416," Exactly, couldn't have said it any better. Neidermayer's work rate was phenomenal and Beauchimen's was anything but. Kessel is good for 50 points with Savard, without him we will see.........if he stays injury free"
392737,bucktail,2009-10-13 23:53:00,1857,HAHAHAHAHAHA.......Sorry nothing gives me more pleasure then watching them lose. PLEASE..... STOP GOING PEOPLE...its the only answer!
392744,Radnine,2009-10-14 00:10:00,1538, Agreed. But the amount of people that actually go to a leaf game are minimal compared to the rest of us that keep the machine alive. Stop watching on TV. That is the key. If CBC and TSN ratings tanked (even a bit) you'd have a new team in a year. Jim
392748,Rizzo,2009-10-14 00:27:00,4754, rriigghhtt...because Montreal is the standard to measure other teams against. Other than beating the Leafs they only have one win! Saying the Leafs looked good against Montreal is like saying I should enter my Hyundai Pony in Nascar because I nearly beat a Dodge Neon at a stoplight.
392750,BassAsin,2009-10-14 00:34:00,806,"i'm pretty sure the leafs are the only team that could be 0-81 and still manage to sell out for game 82, no clue how."

392764,Governator,2009-10-14 01:09:00,879,To be honest I'm surprised Wilson hasn't reduced komisarek's playing time or perhaps even bench him for a period.  So far he's been the worst on the team imo and yet everyone seems to praise him?  He coughs up the puck more than McCabe did and takes more useless penalties than anyone in the league.  Just tonight we score to make it 2-1 on the power play and less than 30sec later he takes a massive elbowing penalty to tucker who gets revenge on the scoresheet.  Bench his a$$

Sens fans REALLY suck, even more so than the 40 year old business class LEAFS supporters. Montreal likes to be loud and party...what can I say"
392834,holdfast,2009-10-14 05:24:00,1813," Well i wouldnt brag about Habs fans too much, as soon as you do, well they pull something stupid.  Remember the Riot after winning one game in the Playoffs a couple of years ago.  However as far as Sens fans are, What can I say, Plastic, if Molson Ex changed the looks of their bottle, Ottawans will change brands, because, well its Preppy, went to a bar and I watched two men, I think, cat fighting, went to a hockey game, felt out of place because I should of worn a suit and watched the game with my cell phone.  They deserve Alfie.  Only fans that can call him an Idol."
