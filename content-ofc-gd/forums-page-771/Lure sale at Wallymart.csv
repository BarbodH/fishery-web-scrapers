396866,HTHM,2009-10-27 23:23:00,4082,I just saw lots of lures and plastics on clearance at my local wal-mart. Deep diving tail dancers for $7.00 as an example
396869,mbosh1980,2009-10-27 23:32:00,349,thanks
396986,Stern Rules,2009-10-28 04:14:00,342,I know the one here in Brantford used to do that around this time for a couple years in a row but haven't done it in a few years.
396995,bassmasta,2009-10-28 05:26:00,27,they've been on sale at mine for the past 3 weeks.  Look at the end of the isle or at the bottom racks of the fishing section.  Picked up 2 tail dancers for $7 each 3 weeks ago.

397045,Fishnwire,2009-10-28 14:56:00,983,"  I couldn't agree more.  Goggle a phrase like ""Wal-mart is evil"" and spend a couple of minutes learning about the utter disregard Wal-mart has for everyone that stands in its way of making greater and greater profits.  They stick it to everyone they come in contact with from their employees to their suppliers.  Those low prices come at a high cost...and don't forget that once they've successfully undermined enough of their competition those competitive prices will give way to monopoly imposed gouging.  Make no mistake, that is their ultimate goal.  Wal-mart is the perfect example of how corporations can generally not break any laws but still demonstrate how completely and utterly ammoral they truly are.  Moral highground aside, I've seen the fishing section and the walmart in Sudbury and it's a freaking joke.  Pretty much all kid's stuff."
397091,fishinfool,2009-10-28 18:05:00,366," I feel exactly the same way about the Tim Hortons Monopoly, they knocked out all the Ma and Pa coffee places and now you can't go a block without running into a Timmies. Watch the price increases fly, in fact didn't we just get hit another 10c a cup recently? Monopolies like that cut down on our options as consumers and allows them to set the price wherever they like. Sorry about Hi-Jacking your thread Hometownhandyman!! Had to get it off my chest..."
397120,fishinguypat,2009-10-28 20:28:00,547,7.00 bucks for a taildancer ha that'll be the day...good for trolling though
397126,Ben_Daniels,2009-10-28 20:41:00,435, Tim Horton's isn't a Monopoly.....
397132,grt1,2009-10-28 21:03:00,638,"if you can't go a block without running into a timmies, I guess I live on one of the worlds' longest blocks 215 km to my timmies"
397139,SBCregal,2009-10-28 21:18:00,688,I drive by at least 3 on my 5km trip to work.
397265,Radnine,2009-10-29 01:18:00,1538,"Never mind lures at Wallyworld, has anyone stopped in at Epp's lately? Fully stocked and unbelievable prices. I picked two Walley Divers for 4.49 each, they are over $8.00 at Canadian Tire. Bags of YUM grubs and worms in the $4.00 range. I couldn't believe what I was seeing (this was two weeks ago, lots of stock). Jim PS. regarding Tim's, take a thurmos from home if you like and let others do as they see fit. It kills me though, that people would go on strike to make $35 more a month but don't think twice about dropping that much and more on their ""Timmies"" every work day. But to each his own (and get thee to Epp's)"
397271,fishindude,2009-10-29 01:25:00,220,"Stopped by my local wally world today to take a look at the clearance fishing items, didn't see a single tail dancer  , plenty of husky jerks though"
