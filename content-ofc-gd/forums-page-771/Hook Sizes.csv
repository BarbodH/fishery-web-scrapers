397041,Fishnwire,2009-10-28 14:31:00,983,"I'm looking for a chart or something that gives info on the the physical size of hooks relative to their nominal size...meaning I want to know the dimensions of various styles of hooks for each commercially available size.  Basically, I want to be able to measure the gap of a hook (I have a micrometer), refer to the chart and know what size that hook is.  I found this, but it's not quite what I'm looking for.  There are many sizes of various styles not included...for example, look at the octopus hooks...they only show three sizes, and where are the real big trebles?  Also, this chart doesn't actually give dimensions, but just reproduces examples in actual size.  http://www.jannsnetcraft.com/Content/Parts_Sizing.htm  If anyone has a more inclusive chart, I'd appreciate it.  Thanks."

You'll have to do them one manufacturer at a time. There are no more than 5-6 countries producing big name hooks....USA, Finland, Norway etc...  Size charts will be similar but not exactly the same.  Good luck."
