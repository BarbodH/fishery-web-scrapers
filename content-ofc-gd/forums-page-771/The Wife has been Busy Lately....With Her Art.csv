396504,aplumma,2009-10-26 17:54:00,6896,Very nice work she has a hand /eye coordination that I do not see often but I am in awe of whenever I see it.  I hope that when the Tyler event comes up she would offer up a piece for the cause I am sure it would be a real money maker.   Art
396543,misfish,2009-10-26 20:59:00,29133,Awesome .WOW You must be a proud husband/father.

396587,Mike the Pike,2009-10-26 23:41:00,3421,Wow thanks for the kind comments and remarks folks .I think Lisa will come on later to say a few words.  She is overwhelmed with the response from a fishing forum.  Here are some more pics of paintings.                         This is a painting from my 14 yr old Daughter.    Another from my 14 yr old daughter.  MTP
396603,Radnine,2009-10-27 00:37:00,1538,"I drew unemployment once, and flies after leaving fish guts in the back of the boat. But I think your wife and daughter's works might be better than that! Jim"
396604,NAW,2009-10-27 00:41:00,4022,That's some amazing work!  I particularly like one from the first group; the one with the leopard on the tree branch.  I still think it's a picture..
396645,Moosebunk,2009-10-27 02:35:00,3970,Superb work.  Especially like that second one of your wife with the butterfly.  As delicate a concept as the art itself.
396660,Skud,2009-10-27 02:59:00,739,Great work. Your wife could make a great living selling her art so you can retire and fish.
396764,LeXXington,2009-10-27 15:42:00,1928,Holly Molly Batman those are amazing.. Thats a huge talent@!!

397164,Mike the Pike,2009-10-28 22:25:00,3421,"Wow... I just want to say thank you to each and every one of you who have commented on the pictures of my paintings that Mike posted... as well to all of you who took a moment just to take a peek, and especially to the lurker for admitting so, and commenting on top of it!!   I am so very humbled by all of your praise, and admittedly overwhelmed by your response.  I had pretty much almost given up on painting, as I had barely done a stroke of anything for about 15 years (raising the kids).... I have only just returned to it this past year, and I can tell you that I am so very thrilled to be painting and drawing again, and you all have provided me with a little more encouragement to continue full force.  Oh, but Skud, there are no guarantees that Mike can retire so that he can fish full-time... for a few years at least!! lol  Thanks again!!  Lisa"
397165,steverowbotham,2009-10-28 22:28:00,1800,incredible!

I don't know of a soul who would or even could negatively criticize your work. Thank you for sharing it with us."
396302,Mike the Pike,2009-10-26 00:39:00,3421,Well with all the work I have to do around the house these days and Quinte just under 3 weeks to go I thought I would show you folks what my wife Lisa loves to do with her spare time.Here are some Drawings and Paintings.

Does she take commissoins or do it for the love of it only (understandable, since when it becomes a job, some of the love can go with it)?   Thanks,  Mark"
