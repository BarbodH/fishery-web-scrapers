397416,Raf,2009-10-29 13:25:00,3495,might be time for that 'split topic' feature before this one gets outta hand  nice workMike.
397585,lhousesoccer,2009-10-29 23:13:00,442,"Mike ... glad to see you're sticking to your guns and following my advice.  I built up nearly a 2-page list of volunteer Fish & Wildlife activities on my resume over the years while I gained experience to finally get the Fisheries Scientist job I have now.  The volunteer work opened a ton of doors and got me many summer seasonal PAID jobs with the OMNR, OFAH, Environment Canada and so on.  Keep at it!"
397598,MCTFisher9120,2009-10-29 23:29:00,3761, Shootin with the PT/FT job with the Hatchery this summer...We will see what happens.
397600,Twocoda,2009-10-29 23:31:00,4130,regardless of the bantering that may go...  GOOD FOR YOU MIKE ! It is a labour of love and your attidude is perfect for helping ....its an experience through out the whole process and you are richer for it for volunteering...your payoff comes when one of the complainers about the stocking( or any angler) actually catches one and becomes a fan of the atlantics that YOU had a hand in making it possible...since the atlantics ARE suckers for shinny things ( as stated) maybe consideration should be made to shut down the release river from lures permanently to fly rods only  ...just like the Miramichi in New Brunswick...  New handle : Mike the Salmon Releaser
397606,MCTFisher9120,2009-10-29 23:38:00,3761, That might stick man lol
396413,MCTFisher9120,2009-10-26 13:27:00,3761,"For my ""reading"" week I'll still be up here in Lindsay. I got into contact with the Fleming Hatchery and it turns out this week we will be taking part alongside the MNR with the release of approx. 22'000 Atlantic Salmon. From what I know it will be in the Cobourg area but I'm not 100% sure at the moment.  Got my self all dressed up and I'm looking to be adding many pictures towards the end of the week. Also, I'll keep my eye out for what Television stations will be visiting us on our visits out there.    Have a great week everybody, I am soo excited and grateful to be taking part in this event.  Tight lines, MTBF  Edit*  Ok, so I have now added the pictures below, have a look. Have done 4 runs so far, doing 2 more tomorrow out to the location. Out Fall fingerlings are between 10-30isg grams a piece so really nice sized fish2""-4.5"")  The Hatchery   Lifting those buckets full of water and fish     New home   Group Shot   The Setup   The first time out is the best, Steve and I get to do the releasing  (btw other guy was doing underwater filming) Me!   wow   There I go   Another group shot  And two more     We are still going out tomorrow but there will be no more pictures.  Different kind of report but I like it, good luck fella's!  MTBF"
396415,Roy,2009-10-26 13:33:00,13728,Good on ya Mike. It'll be a really good experience for you too! Keep us posted please and have a great week.
396416,MCTFisher9120,2009-10-26 13:34:00,3761,  Will do Roy. Picture's to come. Most likely on the topic starter
396824,MCTFisher9120,2009-10-27 20:29:00,3761,Should be able to get the photo's off of my buddy's camera tomorrow evening after the run to Cobourg
396826,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-10-27 20:43:00,0,good stuff.
396843,Greencoachdog,2009-10-27 22:26:00,8163,"See if you can ""snitch"" a couple dozen to use for live bait!"
397030,bucktail,2009-10-28 13:39:00,1857,Now are you sure there Atlantics and not browns!!  LOL Are they all going to Shelter Valley and the Ganny I assume?
397102,MCTFisher9120,2009-10-28 19:05:00,3761,Added the Pictures!!  /Bump
397103,sconceptor,2009-10-28 19:08:00,146,Should do it at night so the commorrants don't find them as easily.........like they did the odd time over here along Lake Huron hatcheries......release thousands of trout and salmon in the morning and watch those things come on over and eat them all by evening.........
397130,kemper,2009-10-28 21:01:00,2232," Ive heard somewhere else, but I want to check if its for real before I say anything...  If it is true its an interesting choice..."
397142,Paully,2009-10-28 21:26:00,712,  I would bet on somewhere else.. Interesting indeed..
397143,canadadude,2009-10-28 21:26:00,769,Great job......nice to see that old trailer is still working
397157,NAC,2009-10-28 22:03:00,369,"nice line of work there Mike, buddy, pal, friend....  Did you get a bunch of PM's on the location yet? I hope the return rate is better there than what it has been elsewhere in Ontario."
397172,kemper,2009-10-28 22:43:00,2232," what, you mean that they didn't return like many hoped...   I really really really hope this program works....I do.  But, i dunno.  *edit  Im not trying to bash ya here Mike, its great that you're getting involved and its more than I am doing! I hope I'm wrong, I would REALLY love to tangle with one of those little beauties when they get bigger!"
397192,MCTFisher9120,2009-10-28 23:15:00,3761," What was the ""bash""/ question lol?"
397195,MCTFisher9120,2009-10-28 23:17:00,3761,"If if any of you were bashing, bash me all you want. I loved what I was doing and took gratitude towards Chris and Russ. Those guys really achieved something there, Atlantic's are tricky to create from what I heard.  O and it's not the Granny. A smaller inland river in the Cobourg area"
397217,MJL,2009-10-28 23:51:00,2427,Well done Mike...Good stuff for getting out there    What Kemper is referring to is the fact that Atlantics have been stocked into Lake O creeks since the 80’s without any noticeable returns.  Probable causes to the lack of returns and a self sustaining population of Atlantics in Lake O include: Thiamine deficiencies due to the smelt and alewife they eat out in Lake O (it screws up their ability to reproduce). Competition from juvenile rainbow trout while they’re still in streams is another factor.  There’s some thinking that the redds spawning Atlantics dig to lay their eggs are sensitive to sediment and silt (Ironically they were stocked in rivers known as ‘dirty Duffins’) and the success of the eggs surviving is low.
397221,irishfield,2009-10-28 23:55:00,26272,"Maybe the Atlantics are just smarter than the rest and don't come back to the rivers to be snagged during spawn !!  Great stuff Mike... good to see a young lad participating in this and not spending the week doing what most of the students were...  Oh... you did that too, well that's all right !"
397226,Spiel,2009-10-28 23:59:00,9065,Whether or not the atlantic salmon fishery takes off or fails is a moot point. What matters Mike is that you got out and helped.
397242,ciceri,2009-10-29 00:33:00,535,Cool Mike. Did Steve take most of those pictures?
397254,highdrifter,2009-10-29 00:48:00,2534,Good stuff Mike.  Field work is way sweeter than taxonomy eh??  Hope you weren't followed...  cheers HD
397351,Ron,2009-10-29 03:52:00,1683,"Good on ya Mike.  In my eyes, there is nothing more gratifying than putting something back into what someone has a passion for. Ironically lots of people have a negative opinion on the Atlantic Salmon program. The sad part of it is, most of them are avid fishermen/women and do squat for ways to improve the fishery. What I don't understand, people harp and whine about what a waste of money. I always ask them, ""what did it cost you?"" They don't have an answer because it didn't cost them a dime. It didn't cost them a dime for the amount of volunteer hours spent to improve the stream sides. It didn't cost them a dime for the amount of volunteer hours spent raising awareness in the high schools where students took on a handful of fry to raise as fingerlings and then to release them into the streams. It didn't cost them a dime for having volunteers organize a ""clean up day"". It didn't cost them a dime to have volunteers improve the structure on the river and stream beds. It didn't cost them a dime to have volunteers stock these native species in the water sheds. In fact, the people who hope this stocking program fails should know it didn't cost them a dime to improve the over all fisheries of native, naturalized and introduced species. The Atlantic Salmon Restoration Project was funded in large part by Banrock Station Winery, OFAH and the LCBO. Here is a web site for those of you who think this is a waste of time. http://www.bringbackthesalmon.ca/ Mind you, how can it be a waste of time if it's not your dime?"
397383,MCTFisher9120,2009-10-29 11:09:00,3761,"Thanks Ron. It was great to get in with those guys and I am hoping to be out there for every event. Last year only the 2 bosses did it because there were no volunteers  I am shocked that with so many fishermen at our school nobody was there at times.  I'm in for good like I told Chris, if a tank needs to be cleaned or the floors in there whatever. Anything to give those guys a break I'll be there to help out.    If you have released Ron then you know how it feels, Mike"
397384,Garnet,2009-10-29 11:11:00,2056,"It was Durham Region Anglers Assoc. and Bowmanville Creek Anglers Assoc. that got the Atlantic Program started. We had a meeting with Ministry of Natural Resource Newman in his office about Salmon stocking.  Atlantics are a heritage species and we got browns stocked in small numbers in Oshawa Creek,Bowmanville Creek and a couple locations out east when we were there.  There was a MNR policy to not stock Chinook east of the Rouge, we but 7&8 clubs in a room developed a plan that included research materiel, coverage in local news papers, additional press releases and had that policy dropped.  The MNR took a bus trip fact finding trip to New England, New Hampshire and New Brunswick to strat off the Atlantic program.  I believe the only person that read all the study's and reports was me.  One thing I remember is that the Atlantic in prints to the creek and the location in the creek so any stock stocking should be in smaller #'s in every hole.  And the most damming thing is    they are suckers for flashy spoons and spinners, with our charter boats they don't stand a chance.  I really haven't seen any stream work directly focused on the Atlantic program so the money is being wasted.  Garnet"
397386,canadadude,2009-10-29 11:27:00,769,Sadly you seem to leave out the MNR and Conservation Authorities who are 100% funded by my dime. I don't totally disagree with what your saying but lets get all the facts correct.
