397177,redneck666,2009-10-28 22:47:00,563,"right  on man. i myself learned to ride on my uncles old panther 440 but learned how to ride properly on my old 377 single carb. she runs like a top too, some days when it hits -30 it'll take a few tries but its still strong. im thinkin about a dual carb kit. but i got to worry about buyin a bigger faster sled first."
397209,ciceri,2009-10-28 23:38:00,535," I've been thinking of getting a REV 440 for some time now, but I'm not sure if I'd really enjoy it for my rips across the lakes. I know I'd have a blast in the ditches, islands, shorelines and powerlines though."
397591,Jack-of-all-fish,2009-10-29 23:25:00,53,"   Here's my winter ride. I drag my sleigh behind it and behind that my portable hut, but the hut only when its really cold out. This was taken last January northwest of Sudbury. It was -37 C that morning! My buddy is behind me in this pic with his sled."
397676,Dara,2009-10-30 01:42:00,3052,"Had to bring up cold eh....       This shot is warming up before a long days ride. It was only -15F but we left at 8 am and got there at 6 pm. Total miles for the day was 304.6...yes, miles. The next day we rode back. I think I totaled 1100 miles for the week.  stupid pic won't post again"

396733,Dara,2009-10-27 13:46:00,3052,"  Move up to a 500 fan venture and put a 1 1/4"" track on it. Very reasonably priced sled and just as reliable but you will never run out of power. I ran mine with the trail guys for years, throttle squeezed to the bar for hours on end and not a wimper out of it"

396194,JohnF,2009-10-25 15:35:00,3494,"I haven't had any sleds for years but this thread is bringing back great memories. I put myself thru university working in a Skidoo shop, then after my university years worked for the eastern Cdn distributor of Rupp products. Those were great years. I got to ride some very cool (and fast) sleds and didn't have to pay a penny for 'em. The fastest stockers were probably the Rupp F/A's from the winter of '75. My last ride was the day I exploded the track showing a local Skidoo F/A rider that his sled was in fact NOT the fastest thing ever to run on snow. Fortunately he had already conceded defeat when the track let go. Dunno how fast I was going at the time but it was an exciting ride at the end. It looked something like this. I had to find pics on the 'net as I have nothing at all in my own photo collection.    The sled I really coveted was Gene Bloom's factory Mod 440. Saw him race up at Ironwood Mi. and smoke the other factory guys driving bigger sleds (Cat, Polaris, Motoski, Blizzard, SnoJet etc) and he did it with a high mounted engine against the new low front mounted angled engines.  I think though that the best thing Rupp produced for trail guys had to be the Nitro II sleds. They were very fast for F/C sleds but considering that they were the same engine as the SnoTwisters of the day it stands to reason. We ran them pretty competitively against F/A's back in those days with only a minimum of cheating involved, but then the F/A guys were no doubt cheating too. Again a borrowed pic  .  All this talk about hard water sledding got me thinking about the good old days when we occasionally ran the sleds on soft water, sometimes not very far, but it was fun. There used to even be competitions for distance. I never did that. It had to be very hard on the sleds to get dunked hot. There was a guy up in northern Ontario who was pretty well known for it, I think his name was Frenchy Cloutier, from Timmins.    And speaking of racing, do any of you from the French River area know any old racers by the name of Haas? They were fun to watch. They'd show up at OSRF races in a converted school bus with a wood burning stove inside. Seems to me they were Blizzard riders in those days.  JF"
