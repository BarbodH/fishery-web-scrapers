391173,bicephalic,2009-10-08 01:56:00,112," Not that it matters at this point, but he also said he wasn't 100% on the year.  The ad was relatively new at the time - I had a quick look and saw it - figured it was worth the shot.  Thanks for the feedback."
391256,mistaredone,2009-10-08 14:47:00,913,"I used the serial number to find the exact year and it turned out to be a 93.  I took the boat to City Marine in Etobicoke since they do repair, glass body work and used motor sales.  One stop shop.  My quote for the job should be in by the end of the day and ill pass it straight on the the insurence company.  Figers crossed.  Ill update again when I get all the info.  Steve  For those wondering about the serial number.  The model number is TE90TLETS  T = Tracker E = Evinrude 90 = HP T = Tilt & Trim/Electric start L = 20 inch shaft ET = year of manufacture: 1993 S = production run identifier  the rest is the serial number."
397163,mistaredone,2009-10-28 22:22:00,913,"So after 2 weeks of City Marine dragging thier feet to get me a quote and dealing with the marine adjuster and RBC it seems to all be wrapping up.  I got book value on the motor $2800, repairs and labour on boat $2200 and electronics $1000 minus deductable $500 and im getting a check for about $5500.  It ended as a cash settlement due to city marine quoating on a motor that was a few years newer than the one I had.  All in all im pretty happy with the settlement.  RBC were good people to deal with.  Ill be at City Marine bright and early tommorrow to talk to them.  Its been a long and painfull time being land locked.  Thanks to the guys who offered to take me out even though schedules never worked out.  Wendle, Glen, Skipper Sam, Workwear much appreciated  Another school of thought I have right now is blowing off the end of the season, selling the boat and trailer and upgrading in the spring........  It might be the smart thing to do but the thought of being on the water next week might be too much."
388286,mistaredone,2009-09-29 21:30:00,913,"I have been storing my boat in my sisters building underground this summer and when I went to pick up my boat today I find an empty spot where my motor used to be.  Damn!!!!!  It was a 90hp Evanrude tracker 92-93.  I have insurence on the boat but im sure this will still cost me a bundle.  Also my gps with navionics chip and fish finder consols are gone.  These guys must have known what they were doing to pull this job off.  The engine weighs 300lbs, cables, wires, bolts under the deck, ugh!  So far I have checked kijiji and craigslist looking for my motor but no luck.  If anyone can think of other places I should look or advice for the process ahead would help.  Thanks  Steve  Im not 100% on the year      The carnage    "
388287,[emailÂ protected],2009-09-29 21:33:00,290,Damn man. That sucks  Sorry to hear.
388288,watertight,2009-09-29 21:38:00,50,Sorry for your loss. Happened to me too a while back. You are correct it will cost you $ to replace even if you have insurance.
388289,mistaredone,2009-09-29 21:39:00,913,I was getting ready for two days of musky fishing on Lake St Clair.  Hope im not land locked for the season.
388294,Terry,2009-09-29 21:50:00,14456,"yup, I feel for you  I had my ATV stolen and the insurance only gave me half of what it would take to replace it, less then 500km on it I would like to cut their manhood off"
388295,Tom McCutcheon,2009-09-29 21:57:00,627,That's scary... where bouts in missisauga was that? will keep an eye out in the Kawarthas also.
388355,mistaredone,2009-09-29 23:55:00,913," It was taken Erinmills and 403.  I appreciate you keeping an eye out.  I just got back from making a police report.  A good tip going forward was to take down serial the numbers for your gps, trolling motor, fish finders ect in the rare case of recovery.  Man I feel low."
388365,smokin joe,2009-09-30 00:11:00,226,"Sorry to hear about your losses, I'd keep an eye on E Bay as well.  Best of luck to you man. I hope you get everything back."
388367,ketchenany,2009-09-30 00:24:00,3229,"Sorry to hear about your loss; a lot of  :asshat :S out there looking for a quick $. I park in an underground where I work and just recently noticed a camera in the ceiling at the exit door, maybe you can ask them if they have one and get the tapes.  My son in law a few years back got his car taken (Honda SIR) out of a Canadian Tire parking lot at 1 pm. He is the GM and when his employees asked where he went for lunch he told them he hadn't gone yet; maybe not you but the car did, NOT a trace of it.  Good luck."
388382,CLofchik,2009-09-30 00:53:00,854,"Be sure to check other provinces, alot of stuff flows down the 401.  There's been an epidemic of motorcycle theft out of condos in the last few years, the only one I know of that was recovered was on the Montreal Kijiji."
388401,johnnyb,2009-09-30 01:36:00,3413,That sucks man....sorry to hear it...some good ideas here with the kijiji and video cameras....hopefully it ends well  :s
388420,moparhawk,2009-09-30 01:59:00,146,"Now theres someone that ought to be shoved off a bridge ( into a dry lake ) Thieveing bugger, hope you catch him"
388421,irishfield,2009-09-30 02:01:00,26272,Yep... long pier ..when the tides out !  Unfortunate Steve. Will be stripped and parted out on Ebay.
388452,muskymike,2009-09-30 03:08:00,772,"I'll keep an eye out the Ottawa way, see if any Yamaha deals are floatin' around for ya."
388488,Fish4Eyes,2009-09-30 11:18:00,1022,They got all the time they need when its in an underground facility. The other day I saw an older bowrider UNLOCKED in a GO carpool lot. My co-workers are telling me its been there for months too.
388489,JEREMY,2009-09-30 11:23:00,300,There is  a magazine called smart shopper with lots of motors.We print it at where i work and we are printing it tonight i will take a look.Good luck with the hunt
388500,bicephalic,2009-09-30 12:07:00,112,http://brantford.kijiji.ca/c-cars-vehicles...QAdIdZ155993806  ?  Sorry to hear this man...really stinks.
388935,Fish4Eyes,2009-10-01 14:24:00,1022,He mentioned its 92-93 model year. That motor on kijiji is 94.
388954,keiths,2009-10-01 14:44:00,30,"If you have it, someone will try to steal it.  Any marks or whatever on the motor so it can be recognized? Or maybe a photo."
389011,mistaredone,2009-10-01 16:54:00,913,Pics added.  I have a marine guy coming tomorrow to asses the damage done to the boat from the butcher job.
389036,ohhenrygsr,2009-10-01 17:48:00,947,Sorry about your loss.  Does anyone know of any outboard locks we can get?.  I know they sell them for the smaller 9.9 and 20Hp outboards
389052,mbosh1980,2009-10-01 18:36:00,349,"that happened in an underground?  that sucks...I usually think of my underground parking as safer than above ground.  I leave tonnes of gear in my car in plain sight when i'm in my lot.  Check that, I USED to keep lots of gear in my car.  Not any more."
389072,mistaredone,2009-10-01 19:52:00,913,"Just finished with the marine guy from the insurence company.  He said to have a marina do an estimate done for the whole job, motor, cables ect.  Any marina sugestions would help.  Hopefully this dose not drag out and I can get back out on the water before the season ends."
389079,Tom McCutcheon,2009-10-01 20:02:00,627,"Sounds like you are in good hands with the insurance guy (pun intended if with State Farm or is that All State?) Are they replacing your motor with new or used equipement? The reason I ask is it might be the time to upgrade to a four stroke, even if you have to pay the difference.  Tom."
389102,mistaredone,2009-10-01 21:01:00,913,"  I will get a quote of the whole job, motor included but I think the motor will be given a book value.  The equipment will be used.  The value on the insurence for boat, trailer and motor as a whole is $10,000."
