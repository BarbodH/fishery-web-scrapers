Will the bass be biting this time of year?  My backup plan is to bring the atv and some grouse load but dont like the idea of tones of moose hunters running around the woods in the area.  Thoughts?  Thanks!"
395441,basskicker09,2009-10-22 16:12:00,144,bring the boat but then again i dont hunt bass should be biting
395688,Carp,2009-10-23 02:38:00,1488,"Haven't been there in years, but I'd definitely bring the boat. Baptiste Lake is connected to Elephant Lake and offers some good fishing as well."
395732,singingdog,2009-10-23 10:32:00,1047,"The smallies are definitely still biting...not super aggressive, but lots of big ones to be caught if you have the patience. There is some good rainbow fishing in that area as well.  Yes, there are lots of moose hunters out right now: leave your antler-hat at home!"
395807,Sinker,2009-10-23 17:01:00,8692,"Waterfowling is decent on elephant lake too. Why not do a duckhunt in the morning, and fish the afternoon/evening? There are plenty of grouse up there too.  S."
395813,jimmer,2009-10-23 17:40:00,2730,Good pike fishing and some muskie in Elephant also.  I would stay out of the bush if the Moose guys are still banging away.
395929,singingdog,2009-10-24 01:41:00,1047, Ditto that. There are pickups parked everywhere....and lots of citiots out for their yearly dose of Daniel Boone.
396091,GeorgeJ,2009-10-24 23:29:00,207,"I was up to Bancroft several times this past summer, I was lucky enough to be able to bring both. ATV on the back of the pick-up boat on a trailer behind. I'm glad I didn't have to pick, but right now with all the hunting and this area basically shuts down to hunt I'd probably bring the boat."
397067,cityfisher,2009-10-28 15:50:00,959,thanks all for the comments... decided to bring the ATV... found some nice trails in the area and went for a couple nice runs... surprised to not see one grouse during my couple days out there.. noticed 2-3 boats a day on the water.. not alot but the weather was better than expected... I came down with the flu the day i go there so the ATV was good enough...  If i was feeling better the boat would of been the way to go... great scenary this time of the year up there!
