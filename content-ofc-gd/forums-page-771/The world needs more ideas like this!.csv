397462,bigfish1965,2009-10-29 15:35:00,3382,"I live in St Catharines...still the fattest city in Canada..woo hoo!! We are proud and want to thank our sponsors, THD and McD's!!"
397466,bubbles,2009-10-29 15:41:00,591,That is Awesome!  I always find it amazing how something so simple can make us monkeys change our ways! We (myself included) are far too fat these days and something needs to change to help address the situation.
397489,DRIFTER_016,2009-10-29 17:12:00,10439,"Taking the stairs doesn't help. I take the stairs many times each day and it hasn't helped me at all. Maybe if they stopped putting growth hormoes in everything we eat, then that might help."
397504,Bly,2009-10-29 18:38:00,1556,That is really cool Rick and it does look like fun!    Couldn't help but ask though.....wouldn't it be cheaper and increase the number to 100% by just turning off the escalator?
397506,bigfish1965,2009-10-29 18:49:00,3382, Never take away someones choices..they don't like that. But you can easily get them to make the other choice given the right stimuli. We are definitely sheep as a whole. Remember the good thing about escalators..they can never break. Worst case scenario is they become stairs (Mitch Hedberg very funny comedian said that).
397508,bigfish1965,2009-10-29 18:51:00,3382, Yeah..thats what it is..lol. Those growth hormones that target my gut!!! How do they do that anyway...lol.
397516,Roy,2009-10-29 19:22:00,13728, Must be lotsa guys wishing they went somewhere else eh? Not to mention the women....
397517,kickingfrog,2009-10-29 19:24:00,8333,I knew not takin' piano lessons as a kid was gonna bit me in the butt!
397519,Roy,2009-10-29 19:27:00,13728,"I could see me running up the stairs to the tune of "" she had hair on her belly like the branches of a tree""  and catching a snootfull of purse once at the top."
397520,DRIFTER_016,2009-10-29 19:27:00,10439,  Mitch Hedberg was indeed a very funny man. Too bad that he is no longer with us.
397521,BillM,2009-10-29 19:33:00,17367,"  How is St.Catharines the fattest city in Canada?  The most donut shops maybe, but the fattest?  We made it on to Letterman!!! lol  I was born and raised there, moved at 26."
397526,bubbles,2009-10-29 20:06:00,591," That is easy, put it in a brown bottle!"
397609,Greencoachdog,2009-10-29 23:41:00,8163,  It would help if you'd stop stuffing the groth hormones in your mouth!!!... try leafy green vegetables instead!!!
397619,misfish,2009-10-30 00:02:00,29133," Right on Drift.  It,s in that poop too dawg.  Just watch some of your own food channel.  Great clip Rick."
397634,Greencoachdog,2009-10-30 00:17:00,8163,  I've seen you cook.. I know you're a veggie hater too!... typical Canadian!!!
397659,Daplumma,2009-10-30 01:02:00,1961,"Mitch kicked ass,one of the best to be sure. Dawg loves his leafy veggies,tobacco IS a veggie...right?"
397660,danbouck,2009-10-30 01:02:00,4380,Everybody should go repair elevators for a week. They will never use elevators and escalators again  Wife get's pissed when we have to go to the 8th floor
