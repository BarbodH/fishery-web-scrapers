396344,pike slayer,2009-10-26 02:17:00,1177,So today my buddy and i headed up by aubery falls for some fall pike action. We headed out at 7am and it was a 2hour drive up from the sault. We drove a couple different bush roads for partridge and never seen a single bird! We only seen one on the ranger and well thats to much of a highway to stop and blast him. We went up into my favorite pike lake. The bite was extremely slow today and were hitting light. We got only 10 pike which is sad for this lake where i normally get 40-60 in a day. The largest shown was 10lbs 35.5inches. My buddy got it on a matzuo deep diver haha it was funny cause i always bash the matzuos and it caught the fish of the day. We set my minn kota to number 1 and put on deep divers and just slowly dragged bottom. usually you work x-raps and other crank baits as hard as you can and they just normally smash them. I might get out once more but the pike are shutting right down. bring on the ice!!!
