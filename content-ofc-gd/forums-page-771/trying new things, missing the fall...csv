Went out to Ganonoque twice this past week to learn the waters in the area and have a look at that famous 40 acre shoal. Different style of fishing than I am used to. So we haven't gotten a pull yet, but the fish we mark out there are simply enormous!!  We have been running the typical setups, with very long flat lines, burger king rigs, and even mixing up things from our home waters and trying to make them work out there. Anybody familiar with the big water troll for muskies out there?  I plan on spending a few more days out there again this fall, so I am willing to risk sacrificing my usual musky days localy in hopes to maybe get a spotted 45+ pounder out there... even tho I might just come back empty handed at the end.  So while I am learning a new way and new waters for big muskies, I was not missing much localy, seems to be a bit tough, but my buddy got himself a nice 30 pounder.  "
