396822,alexmedic,2009-10-27 20:14:00,186,Has anyone ever heard of these rigs?  I heard they are great for perch.
396828,rbaquial,2009-10-27 21:18:00,968,"Yup, They seem to appear @  random in Canadian Tire stores. (at least that's where I've seen them most). Sometimes I'd spot them @ WAL-MART too..."
396842,Greencoachdog,2009-10-27 22:24:00,8163,Do yourself a favor and consider purchasing some of these!  http://www.cabelas.com/cabelas/en/template...&hasJS=true  I kill the Crappie with them and I know they'll catch Perch too!
396844,Terry,2009-10-27 22:28:00,14456, but don't forget to cut 2 hooks off
396852,Greencoachdog,2009-10-27 22:51:00,8163,  .. or you can just bait 4 and leave the other 2 bare!... 4 baited hook points or 6 hook points to a lure eh!!!   ... or you can purchase the much stronger but more expensive 4 hook Hayabusa Sabiki rig!
396865,Terry,2009-10-27 23:22:00,14456,"the way I read it  4 hooks, I don't see any other way of looking at it  Hook – A hook includes a single-pointed or multiple-pointed hook on a common shaft but does not include a snagger or spring gaff. The number of hooks includes any single-pointed or multiple-pointed hooks that are part of a lure. Hooks and Lines – An angler may use only one line, unless otherwise stated in the regulations. Two lines may be used when angling from a boat in parts of the Great Lakes (see Exceptions to the General Regulations) and for ice fishing in many areas (see Ice Fishing, page 11). A fishing line must not have more than four hooks attached."
