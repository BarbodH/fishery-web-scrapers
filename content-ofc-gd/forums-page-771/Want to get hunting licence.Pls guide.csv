397346,SBCregal,2009-10-29 03:34:00,688,i believe basspro does them.  dont know the price or the schedule for the classes.  check out local gun/shooting clubs and from what i've seen from the club pages i've seen most have some handy links or offer classes as well.  from a few posts that have been posted in the last while it seems like the paperwork/process takes quite a while so it'd probably be best to do it as soon as possible.  i really dont know any of this firsthand but i've been looking into getting my license as well.  ryan
