397022,Roy,2009-10-28 13:03:00,13728,Her name was Gis√®le Benoit.
397023,legacey,2009-10-28 13:10:00,127,"   I love this picture...almost spit my coffee out.  Those guys look like they're doing a ""Dances with Moose!"" move.  ...isn't that a patient transfer vehicle? Maybe the moose already had 1 down.  Cheers"
397026,Muskieman,2009-10-28 13:22:00,2472,   Like Roy said ; Gisele Benoit IS her name .... not dead    I found her site but cannot find a video.  http://www.giselebenoit.com/accueil.html
397048,Fishnwire,2009-10-28 15:05:00,983,"I'm a little surprised that no one has suggested that the photo is not genuine.  It looks very real, except for the fact that the moose itself seems impossibly large.  I hope it's real, but I'm cynical about such pics I see on the net."
397060,Bob,2009-10-28 15:38:00,370,Ain't Photoshop a wonderful toy?  I've seen that first one in about a dozen different emails from almost as many different locations (reportedly) from Port Loring to somewhere in Alaska.
397066,Whitespinnerbait,2009-10-28 15:48:00,2038,  Photoshopped if i've ever seen one....
397069,moemoe,2009-10-28 16:00:00,352,"if you look at the site http://www.stevesugrim.com/blog/2009/01/big-moose.html, the second photo definitly looks photoshopped"
397073,SylvanOwner,2009-10-28 16:21:00,266,"Check out the ""Grizzly Man"" movie or Google Timothy Treadwell if you're into real life stories of people playing animal.  Dan"
397075,Roy,2009-10-28 16:23:00,13728,"When I opened the thread, my first mental image was of Chuck Norris soiling his shorts."
397077,Cookslav,2009-10-28 16:38:00,1457,I don't know...I don't think its photo shopped? Even if it was its not as though they don't get that big?       I've seen them big enough to surmise they can and do get bigger. If its a Photo shop then its a good job I suppose
397085,legacey,2009-10-28 17:34:00,127,"I remember as a kid, someone in Napanee where I grew up, had shot a hige moose...just under the world record they had told us.  People from all around came to see it hanging in the tree there.  Amazing!"
397087,bigugli,2009-10-28 17:45:00,6138,"Pic may be photoshopped?  In life they do get that big. Helped drag one that big north of the Soo some 27 years back. The bull was dressed, out and quartered where he dropped, and dragged back in 5 pieces. It was a very long walk dragging our chunk back to camp."
397089,Rich Clemens,2009-10-28 17:54:00,3131,That's just un-real.
397097,TJQ,2009-10-28 18:37:00,7806,wow.... id run too....
397161,aplumma,2009-10-28 22:20:00,6896,"  ""moosie""   Art"
397272,Skud,2009-10-29 01:25:00,739,Good thing this is just a small one. 
397287,siwash,2009-10-29 01:56:00,683,the first pic has been circulatiing on hunting sites... apparetly its a hoax
397291,siwash,2009-10-29 01:58:00,683, Bear in mind that the moose is in the foreground and the people are background so it looks a lot bigger...
397302,rickster,2009-10-29 02:17:00,495,and this is what hunts those big moose    
397336,justwannafish,2009-10-29 03:27:00,82,If I was anyone but Rocky I'd be runnin from Bullwinkle! That is a LARGE animal!! Damn!
397468,anders,2009-10-29 15:46:00,1168,"Like others..ive seen that email a few times now...and its been everywhere from Alaska, to Maine to NFLD and everywhere in between. Although i know moose get to be massive...im a skeptic of this photo."
396860,bigfish1965,2009-10-27 23:17:00,3382,   Take from http://www.stevesugrim.com/blog/2009/01/big-moose.html
396863,Pigeontroller,2009-10-27 23:21:00,2793,"Holy cow, I mean Bull..."
396867,Terry,2009-10-27 23:23:00,14456,my god that looks big
396870,bassdreamer,2009-10-27 23:33:00,128,Holy crap  !!!!
396872,Skud,2009-10-27 23:43:00,739,Hope that big boy spreads out is genetics before he takes a bullet. That is much bigger than average.
396873,MCTFisher9120,2009-10-27 23:43:00,3761,"2nd on that site   Incredable man, just incredable. Never got to see a Moose like that before but is a ""Bull"" the biggest of them all aka that!"
396887,danc,2009-10-28 00:24:00,4677,It's always nice to get out of your vehicle to get closer for that awesome photo when you see a Northwestern Ontario Moose.    
396892,danbouck,2009-10-28 00:54:00,4380,Wasn't that pic posted on here last year?
396893,irishfield,2009-10-28 00:54:00,26272, Like Jasper and the goal is a close up of the bear...
396895,drwxr,2009-10-28 01:04:00,453,wow those beasts are giant. can't believe some hunt these big creatures for fun. any idea how old are they?
396904,danc,2009-10-28 01:26:00,4677, Maybe. Some of us weren't here last year.
396906,Dara,2009-10-28 01:30:00,3052," 5 to 10 years old likely. They are only fun till you shoot them, when you have to drag them out of the bush it is all work."
396908,bigugli,2009-10-28 01:34:00,6138,"That there would be a year's supply of meat for some lucky family.  Don't snigger, I've known a few families who have depended on game as the sole supply of meat over winter."
396914,Greencoachdog,2009-10-28 01:47:00,8163,"Mooses!!!... they're such a ""killer"" vegetarian species eh?!!!  I guess they're fair game if you're too afraid to hunt wild hogs with a pocket knife!  Canadian wussies glorifing killing mild mannered vegetarians... what's next???... Steelhead fishing???"
396918,Bernie,2009-10-28 01:54:00,3190, That fact still holds true.  I also know of some to this day.
396919,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-10-28 01:54:00,0,mild mannered? come up to canada in october and walk through the bush with a fake rack on your head!   then you'll see how mild mannered a pissed off bull is!
396920,danc,2009-10-28 01:57:00,4677," Fake racks are a dime a dozen these days. Speaking of which, has anyone else ever seen that documentary about that woman artist from Quebec that walks with the Moose?? I've seen it twice but haven't seen it in over 10 years. Amazing show. She does exactly what you're talking about Doc and she has the Moose in the palm of her hands. And her artistic talents are amazing."
396929,Twocoda,2009-10-28 02:07:00,4130,Imagine if you will.....pedal to the floor in reverse on a dirt road in an astro van....why ???? because a mild mannered moose wanted to ask for directions to the water hole??? i dont think so ...  luckily the dust storm from going so fast in reverse stopped him from charging on  GCD i had bow for supper last night ...and Caribou tonight ...if there was wild boar  around these parts i would have that tomorrow night ...but i think ill settle for an American delicacy of a milked out Holstein from our local Mc Donalds
396955,muskymike,2009-10-28 03:03:00,772," Seems like a reasonable thing that most people would do for fun.  Then travel to the arctic covered in seal blubber and blood and throw ice at a polar bear, surely it wont be provoked."
396959,wuchikubo,2009-10-28 03:05:00,1114,It's the first time I've seen that pic.  That bull moose looks massive! Either it's big or it's walking through miniture world.
396967,Cookslav,2009-10-28 03:14:00,1457,Geeze those are Huge  I've seen a fair share from a distance and a handfull up close and personal but none quite that big. Beautifull and healthy I might add....  If one of my buddies brought me that to butcher I think I'd have to charge some overtime LOL!
396988,thalweg,2009-10-28 04:32:00,112,Certainly a trophy Bull if you're into that sort of thing.  I prefer the taste of calves myself and rather let those big fella's keep makin em!!
396994,fishindude,2009-10-28 05:17:00,220,"What a beautiful animal, a true symbol of Canada. Never understood how someone could kill such a large animal, but to each their own.  Cheers"
397012,canadadude,2009-10-28 12:08:00,769,"Thats one big old bull, probably on it's last years of fertility.......probably taste like an ole boot aswell not a very good specimen to hunt for the table, better off to leave this old dude alone to live out it's last days."
397019,Muskieman,2009-10-28 12:59:00,2472,"  "" La Femme aux Orignaux""  She was killed by a bull a few years back...........  I'll try to find a link...........  RFS "
