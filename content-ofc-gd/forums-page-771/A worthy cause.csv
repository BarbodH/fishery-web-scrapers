I'm joining several police services/departments from across the Globe to raise money for prostate cancer. Yes....it's true, I'm growing a mustache for charity!  If you are interested in making a donation, please feel free to donate. It doesn't matter if it's a dollar or twenty, every cent helps.  I know I'm not supposed to post things of this nature on OFC but many of us have lost out brothers, fathers, grandfathers and friends to this terrible disease.  Thanks guys.  Here is the link  https://www.movember.com/ca/donate/your-det...mber_id/135281/  All proceeds go to Prostate Cancer Canada"
