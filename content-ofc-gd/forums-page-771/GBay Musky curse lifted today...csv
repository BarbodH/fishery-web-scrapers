396487,limeyangler,2009-10-26 16:45:00,5204,"Great stuff wayne, really nice fish. I'm jealous, i cant say i've caught a musky yet."
396494,Headhunter,2009-10-26 16:57:00,5703,I bet I can guess Terry! HH
396495,Terry,2009-10-26 17:03:00,14456,"no, not that one, it's for walleye  I don't know why the fish swam away as fast as they could    "
396501,Headhunter,2009-10-26 17:36:00,5703, Now that's funny! HH

396534,johnnyb,2009-10-26 20:28:00,3413,"You guys are too much!  Way to go, Wayne"
396598,Spiel,2009-10-27 00:09:00,9065,"Cursed? I think not, perhaps you had a monkey on your back, or the proverbial ""white stripe"" but cursed, no, definitely not.  Congrats Wayne, it's a nice wittle musky....."
396646,Moosebunk,2009-10-27 02:37:00,3970,Great looking fish Wayne.  I don't know that spot???
396670,irishfield,2009-10-27 03:28:00,26272, Terry was quick to add it to his way points though....
396681,Bernie,2009-10-27 04:06:00,3190,"Hee Hee. Well done Wayne. How are ya with carp?  Terry, Headhunter Joe has been schooled from time to time too. Can I tell you a story?   I love this stuff. This is the type of thread this forum was built on."
396690,AzuluSpookd,2009-10-27 06:12:00,348,Nice report IF...good job on the ski'   Me's thinkin' that you and Bruce need to sit down and have a chat...get all of that hostility out of the way....
396713,Vanselena,2009-10-27 12:35:00,269,A shotgun mic will help with your sound issues.
396714,Headhunter,2009-10-27 12:35:00,5703,Bernie... Terry doesn't need any help to take shots at my fishing abilities! LMAO HH
396773,Terry,2009-10-27 16:15:00,14456,you know I didn't put a waypoint where you caught the fish......dang that was dumb of me.......
396799,irishfield,2009-10-27 17:49:00,26272,"That's good... then only I know the spot...... oh and Andy, as I told him where it was !"
396813,Guest gbfisher,2009-10-27 19:14:00,0,Wayne?  He lied.......
396817,Terry,2009-10-27 19:32:00,14456,"hey  no I didn't but I know where we were trolling to, so I could find the general  area  besides I figure he will hit the same spot next time LOL"
396819,mikeh,2009-10-27 19:40:00,824,"Congrats on getting the first one out of the way,  last fall I was up there and the water was like glass, I was going from one spot to another , when I saw a big swirl on top of the water, I think it was a big musky feeding on a cormorant, as there was a flock of the in the area a few seconds earlier,  here is a tip for ya..troll between the north tip of the big island that is infront of the new development that is being built in Port and Sturgeon Point, that's where the above fish is hanging out.  good luck"
396830,irishfield,2009-10-27 21:22:00,26272," Hey Marty.. I've got no real issues with Bruce. He's a fine lad... just can't handle his fishing muskie with a conservation license speech... nor can some of his fellow CO's I've talked with that have been in his presence when he launched into it on some poor bugger. He's doing his job and protecting the resources... I just wish there were more of them out there. The only thing that bugs me... is spending the fuel money for the HMS Coffin to be way up in a back bay, hoping to find someone fishing.. vs sitting in the main channel and getting everyone that comes thru or does the final loop around snake... but then again I can see as well that they're making sure everyone is on the up and up with no extra lines, etc. with the element of the BFNW surprise !"
396889,AzuluSpookd,2009-10-28 00:46:00,348,"That's funny  I talked to a CO up in Nakina this past September about the fishing for Musky with a Conservation License and he was the opposite of him, just goes to show the different interpretations...They've got a huge area to cover and I'm glad that they are all over the place....  I hear ya though, I wish there was more of them as well..."
396897,Guest Johnny Bass,2009-10-28 01:05:00,0,Its not a monster but its a start. Its only a mater of time.
396911,ciceri,2009-10-28 01:38:00,535,Wish I could catch a musky outta there.. Nice fish no matter what.
397072,Dano,2009-10-28 16:14:00,719,"Looks fun, congrats on your cherry pop."
396286,irishfield,2009-10-25 23:47:00,26272,"Lots of work to get done around here    .. but late last night I decided it could wait and told Terry to be here for 9am !    While I have put Muskie in my boat, on GBay, for guests... I'd yet to stick one on the end of my own line, until today. No new world record... but it's a Georgian Bay Muskie for me none the less. So now that the curse is lifted I can move onto bigger and better ones (well I sure hope so anyhow!)  37"" without a pinch and clean as a whistle. Back swimming the depths.    Funny for the day was having the OPP boat the HMS Tom Coffin pull up on us in a back bay.. and Bruce Ward the CO asking us to show him our fishing licences through the screen in the window.. while the OPP officer was on his hands and knees trying to get their sliding door open. They couldn't get out of the cabin to do a full safety inspection!"
396287,bucktail,2009-10-25 23:50:00,1857,"Way to go Wayne  GB can be owfully hard to crack, but when i finally did it they started to come a LITTLE bit easier!!"
396288,Kerry,2009-10-25 23:51:00,383,Great place to start Wayne.Now YOU got size to work on out there! Kerry
396291,Leecher,2009-10-26 00:00:00,7832,Sounds like you guys had fun out there..... Congrats on the beauty ski Now I understand why you wanted a spook shipped that fast  Thanks for sharing Leechman
396292,danc,2009-10-26 00:03:00,4677,"Looks like a doctored photo of one of your many, many Nipigon Pike."
396293,irishfield,2009-10-26 00:04:00,26272, Recognized the background eh...
396294,Terry,2009-10-26 00:05:00,14456,"thanks again Wayne I had a great time  there were so many bait fish or some kind of fish that the screen showed the fish as being the bottom        poor cop and CO, that will teach them for stopping us      it was a bit windy/wavy but a great day,.... if you watch the video turn the sound down.... "
396296,irishfield,2009-10-26 00:12:00,26272,Nice shot of my feet bud!!! Anyone hear an engine running??? @ 4500 RPM...
396301,Terry,2009-10-26 00:25:00,14456,I was bounced around LOL  yeah I just hear wind
396313,MCTFisher9120,2009-10-26 01:12:00,3761,"Spectacular catch sir,  Great job! MTBF"
396335,Joey,2009-10-26 01:58:00,9122,"That's fantastic Wayne, way to go.  Paul lifted his LSC musky curse today too (report coming up shortly).  Looks like the weather we had all weekend too  Joey"
396337,OhioFisherman,2009-10-26 02:01:00,6623,Nice of you to catch bait for Lew Wayne!
396339,irishfield,2009-10-26 02:02:00,26272,LOL Paul ! I still think I'm one up on Lew for GBay ... the pike love him out there !
396357,corvette1,2009-10-26 03:08:00,1765,congrats wayne now the ice is broken
396379,Ron,2009-10-26 08:09:00,1683,"Hey good catch Wayne.  Ya gotta start somewhere! It still aint the bottom of the barrel fish at least.  Cheers, Ron..."
396387,OhioFisherman,2009-10-26 12:01:00,6623,"LOL Wayne, lipped one at a bass tournament about 1/3 that size, that one might have got the hand. Always nice to catch something on a trip? with out shedding blood over it? LOL"
396389,solopaddler,2009-10-26 12:08:00,8605,"Excellent fish Wayne, congrat's!"
396397,Roy,2009-10-26 12:40:00,13728,"Glad you two had a good time out there, Wayne. Thanks for the report   brrrrrrrr."
396421,Headhunter,2009-10-26 13:56:00,5703,Nice work guys! Uhmm.... what did Terry catch? HH
396425,bigbuck,2009-10-26 14:14:00,2449,"NICE!!! You've got me beat for GBay muskie!! I've been skunked so far this year but I'm hoping to change that tomorrow. My boat's in the water till the weekend so I've got to finally catch one. I had 2 follows last week, I hope to convert the follows to catches."
396437,snag,2009-10-26 14:50:00,1932,"Cursed?  From what I've seen from you being ""cursed"" does not seem to be problematic.  Well done,  p.s. you could've tossed those poor chaps a can opener!"
396470,Squid,2009-10-26 16:05:00,1656,"Way to go Wayne, great effort to get the first one and now that the curse has been broken, many moere to come."
396478,bigbuck,2009-10-26 16:32:00,2449,"Oh I forgot to mention the 'Coffin'. Those poor guys were stuck in there!! Did Bruce Ward give you a hard time or was he in a good mood? Just kidding, he's a good guy and I've talked to him and the OPP guys on several occasions over at Picnic Island over an ice cream or a coffee. I razz them about the name of their patrol boat."
396482,irishfield,2009-10-26 16:39:00,26272,I wouldn't raz them too hard... it's named after an officer that was shot in the back of the head in a Penetang bar... by the chairman of the policing commission.  Bruce was a little embarassed and a tad hard to give you a hard time if you can't get out of your boat !   No sermon... because we both had sport licenses!
396485,Terry,2009-10-26 16:42:00,14456,"   shut up, you        LOL   but can't you guess what lure I dragged all day long"
