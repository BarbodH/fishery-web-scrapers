396755,Fish Farmer,2009-10-27 15:22:00,2234,"7 Guys, 3 full days of fishing, Fri.Sat.Sun. 15 Walleye 2 Drum. Biggest Walleye was 8.8 lbs. We caught all our fish west of Keith's Shoal. Seems deep water held most fish. I think most fish were caught on a different lure. All deep runners. Stretch 20's, Tail Dancers, Fingerling's. 150 to 250 back behind boards. We got 1 fish straight off the back, flat line. Between the 2 boats, fish caught, was almost even. Everyone caught a fish, except one, and I'm not tellin  his face is not in the pictures  . Most fish released We fished 4 guys in my boat and 3 in the other, festival boat.  Ferry ride across      Dragging   fish to the boat.        My buddy with a stretch 20 that he stuck purple tape on the sides, caught the biggest, plus 2 fish on that same lure.  This was our other crew. Boat was won in the Perch Fest.          Don't you just hate it when it comes to an end of a good trip.   Were heading back for 4 days on the 25th. of Nov."

396762,Fish Farmer,2009-10-27 15:37:00,2234,Your right Lex 15 Walleye for 3 days 7 guys is not a big count. If it wasn't for enjoying the camaraderie with just getting away with friends. That drag a meat fishery down there wouldn't be my bag. Some times you don't know you got a fish on. Give me drifting or jigging any day. I think it's dragging that big trophy in is what keeps people going.

396838,fishhunter,2009-10-27 21:56:00,604,Great to see you got into them. It was a great weekend with sunday being the big day. Fish had the feed bad on big time!! I was looking for you but you were miles further down then me.
396839,msp,2009-10-27 21:58:00,1336, I agree. When you look down through the crystal clear water and see a 12-14 pounder at the end of your line...........WOW !!!!! Thanks for the report.Great job out there !
396859,Greencoachdog,2009-10-27 23:15:00,8163,"Great report and pics double F!!!  I understand about the comradery thing making it all worth it!... there's nothing better than getting together with a bunch of friends and going fishing!!!  .. and it is almost embarrassing when an old ""trash fish"" like a Sheepshead outfights the targeted species!  ... but hey!... y'all pulled in a few nice ""dirty wet diapers"" and had some good yuks I'm sure!!!"
