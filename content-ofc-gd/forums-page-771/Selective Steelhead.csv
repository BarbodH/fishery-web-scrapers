397115,silverstreak,2009-10-28 20:11:00,146,Hit up a trib yesterday only to find that the steelies were a little hook shy. I guess clear water and heavy Angling pressure will do that. Several presentations later this 33.5 inch steelie found a plain Black spinner/red tubing to it's likeing. My best advice......carry it all and switch it up!!! Good Luck.

397138,tdotfisherman,2009-10-28 21:18:00,317,Throwing small inline spinners in the fall or spring can produce some great Steelhead.. fiesty ones that give you a teriffic fight.  Nice fish.

The best ones were what were marketed as baby dews, they were like a half growed dew worm without the collar, thread them thru the nose on the hook the length of the shank. Haven't seen them in a while though for sale."

They sell live 'trout worms' at one of my local tackle shops (I think they're also called red worms - they don't look red.LOL).  They look like smaller, thinner versions of the cobra sized dewies.  Great bait...Unfortunately chubs and suckers love them too."
