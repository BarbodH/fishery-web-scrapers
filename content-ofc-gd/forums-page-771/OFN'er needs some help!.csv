Although we've had a few incidental walleye catches over the years....usually on the troll, I would like to be able to target them at some point over the weekend.  I'm not looking for someone's hotspot or secret hole, but paterns/past success in this area would be a big help!  If you would prefer to exchange via private msg that is great, maybe I can exchange some succesful muskie patterns from the past few years!"

Good luck"
