972697,Dave Bailey,2016-06-07 20:44:00,1641," http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/windsor/upper-thames-river-spiny-softshell-turtle-1.3618568  Apparently poaching is exacerbating the problem. Other than fish, the only other aquatic animals that may be harvested in Ontario are snapping turtles and bullfrogs, but only from July 15 to September 15, and only in certain Fisheries Management Zones. If you see anyone collecting anything else, no matter where or what time of year, they definitely ARE breaking the law by poaching. If you see such activity, you can call crime Stoppers 1-800-222-TIPS (8477), or call the Ministry of Natural Resources Tips line at 1-877-TIPSMNR (847-7667)"

While all the other species would come onto land from the marsh side of the point this time of year to lay their eggs, the Softshells made the lake side home and would return there after laying their eggs. I suspect while most turtles like to get out of the water on logs or such to bask in the sun the Softshells live their lives in the water."
