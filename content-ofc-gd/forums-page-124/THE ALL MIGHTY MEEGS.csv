972597,akaShag,2016-06-06 18:02:00,2073,"The short rods were basically all anybody used in open water for splake, whities, browns, bows, you name it up on Georgian Bay back in the 80s.  Mind you, most were custom tied rods and slightly longer than your average ice rod.  And yes, jigged vertically, most often with roe.  It was my favourite fishing of the year!!!  And that was when I was spending lots of days in the various rivers and streams chasing steelhead.  As much as it was a blast to tie into a chromer on the long rods, it was just fabulous jigging the short rods for good numbers of often good sized fish.  My biggest whitie weighed 12.49 lb on a grocer store butcher scale.  I had weighed it with my spring scale in the boat and it was showing about 14 pounds, which was close to Terry Frook's record of 14.6 as I recall, so we hauled up the anchor and drove to a grocery store to weigh in my ""potential"" Ontario record.  Well, it was a full two pounds under the record.................and we did eat it.................and never even took a picture of it!  Good memories, and thanks Brian for that trip down memory lane!Doug"

Doug Yep we did that at the mouth of the Notty fun when you got a nice Bow on the short rods  my biggest Whitefish came from flat line trolling at the mouth of silver creek in Creigleith  it was 12.3 LBS weight at the small tackle and bait shop in the house In Singhampton"
972605,misfish,2016-06-06 20:09:00,29133,Ah the old days of the mouth of the notty. Now theres some great memories. Splake and whities.  Thanks gang
972369,misfish,2016-06-04 17:12:00,29133,"The start    It,s has been serving me well the past few weekends, getting me my whities. My confidence is through the roof with this bait now. I have heard and seen it will catch lakers as well. This, I had yet to conquor.  That was until, this morning. First lets get the whitie out of the way. Yup, nailed one the first 5 minutes. In the well it went for adinner for me bud and his mrs,s.    Back down goes the meegs. Theres a fish on the graph zipping around. Big marks from this one. I keep moving the jig up 3 ft or so, smash it back on the bottom and repeat. Then as Im lifting, the mark makes a beeline for the jig. Fish on. At first I thought it was a good whitie. Then it decided to make a run and another run and yet another run. Ok, not a whitie. A 15 minute battle, with a 46"" R-TYPE ice rod,loaded with 10 pound Nanofil and a 4 ft leader of P-Line floro clear, joined only by a uni to uni knot.  Get it to the boat,me bud nets it up. Inhaled the meegs    Can only amagine the battle if it had a whole tail. Not sure what happen to it.    My first on the meegs and biggest on a ice rod. A quick pic and back it went to the depths to rest and yet play with another angler some day.    Both fish onboard just before 6am. The rest of the morning we washed spoons. LOL  If the rain holds off, I,ll be out on the toon in the AM."
972370,manitoubass2,2016-06-04 17:17:00,11391,Nice! I gotta try those meegs up here
972371,misfish,2016-06-04 17:21:00,29133,"Nice! I gotta try those meegs up here   No, you need to try a uni to uni for braid and floro. LMAO  Thanks"
972372,Rodbender,2016-06-04 17:26:00,1027,Nice fish Brian wonder what happened to the tail of the Laker
972373,manitoubass2,2016-06-04 17:37:00,11391,"I do, just not very often.  Perhaps thats why I cant catch many whities lol"
972385,misfish,2016-06-04 19:07:00,29133,"Nice fish Brian wonder what happened to the tail of the Laker  It looked like it was freshly eat,n off. Not sure what would trying to chomp down on that."
972393,Terry,2016-06-04 19:50:00,14456,"  see, relax...I got the net in plenty of time lol"
972395,misfish,2016-06-04 20:00:00,29133," see, relax...I got the net in plenty of time lol  LOL Buddy, yes you did."
972409,Old Ironmaker,2016-06-04 21:18:00,8243,Brian your name and a Meegs are synonymies. I have caught exactly 1 whitefish in my entire life many Moons ago on Bear Creek on Nippising. It tipped the scales at 9 freakin' pounds and the Ontario record was 10 something then. It was the largest fish to date in my novice fishing career around 1980. We didn't even know what it was until we asked a neighbour to ID it and weigh her. I have to admit it wasn't entirely legal as I was having a nap in the cottage when I caught it.
972411,chris.brock,2016-06-04 21:29:00,4053,"Beauty tank laker Bri!  I wonder what the story about loosing half its tail.  I've never heard of using an ice rod for open water jigging, what's the advantage?"
972412,misfish,2016-06-04 21:39:00,29133,"Beauty tank laker Bri!  I wonder what the story about loosing half its tail.  I've never heard of using an ice rod for open water jigging, what's the advantage?  Thanks bud  It,s my set up for the toon, so it,s what I used today. I will say though, it gives the same feeling as when ice fishing. Movement wise. Although, I was using the same jig on a 6.6 UL Ugly stick last weekend and still got fish.LOL  Those R-Type rods have some major back bone. I have 4 now, and love them."
972415,manitoubass2,2016-06-04 21:53:00,11391,"Id imagine using an ice rod for jigging in a toon would be alot of fun! And save alot of space, increase mobility"
972417,misfish,2016-06-04 21:58:00,29133,"Id imagine using an ice rod for jigging in a toon would be alot of fun! And save alot of space, increase mobility  Space for rods is not a problem. I have rod holders behind the seat. I,ll be adding 2 more before the bass season opens."
972418,manitoubass2,2016-06-04 22:02:00,11391,So whats with the ice rods? Just for vertical jigging lakers and whities?
972419,misfish,2016-06-04 22:04:00,29133,So whats with the ice rods? Just for vertical jigging lakers and whities?  WINNER
972420,chris.brock,2016-06-04 22:08:00,4053,"  I've got way more hours vertical jigging lakers on an ice rod rather than a long rod in a boat, so there's a comfort factor there too  this could be a new trend"
972423,manitoubass2,2016-06-04 22:12:00,11391, Watch it catch on and ice rods get up to the $80/$90 dollar range???
972429,chris.brock,2016-06-04 22:23:00,4053,"There could be some money to be made on this, the bass guys likely NEED 3, 3.5 and 4 foot drop shotting rods to cover all their bases for all circumstances"
972430,manitoubass2,2016-06-04 22:43:00,11391,Lol
972444,spincast,2016-06-05 00:18:00,3279,nice one .... you'll know that one if you find him again...
972501,shimano19,2016-06-05 19:50:00,196,"I caught one with the top of the tail missing 2 ice seasons ago, was wondering myself what could have caused it "
972524,Meegs,2016-06-05 22:15:00,249,Way to go Brian.  Your on fire!!!
972527,kickingfrog,2016-06-05 22:26:00,8333,Interesting to see a similar injury of 2 different fish.
972569,manitoubass2,2016-06-06 09:09:00,11391,"Is it possible these fish are in an area competing for space with pike and or muskie?  Ive seen pike take a swipe at other fish, not to eat them, but just kinda a ""hey, this area is mine"" type a thing"
972574,shimano19,2016-06-06 11:54:00,196,That's the first thing I though of was a pike since this laker came out of 25fow. It looks pretty fresh to
