Rear deck plates are off, and I can see where I want to run everything, but how difficult is it to remove and re-route then reattach everything? Hydraulic assist steering- pretty sure I can simply bleed air out after reattaching. But cables and wires to motors- straightforward to trace and remove?"
967081,John Bacon,2016-04-20 18:17:00,3277,"I don't have any experience.  But I suggest labeling the cables, hoses, etc. and also labeling where they are attached to the motors."
967083,DRIFTER_016,2016-04-20 19:23:00,10439,"Cabling us pretty easy. There are usually one or two multi-pin connectors under the engine cover that need to be disconnected. Then there are the throttle and shift cables, fuel lines and battery cables and of course steering."
