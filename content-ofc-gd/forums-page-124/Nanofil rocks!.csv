972230,captpierre,2016-06-03 15:50:00,2521,A few weeks ago I asked you guys about a better casting braid on a spinning reel I had been using 10 lb Crystal but wasn't happy with casting distance. Some recommended Nanofil. Bought some 12 lb and tried it. So far it's great. Way smoother and casts probably 10-20% further and with less effort. Kinda pricey but only put 75 yards on my 2500 reel with leaving 1/4 spool of the Crystal on as a backing. Thanks Gents for the recommendation.
972232,manitoubass2,2016-06-03 15:52:00,11391,"12lb!  Crap, try 8lb lol.  Glad ya like it.  Remember double palomars for the dental floss"
972236,BillM,2016-06-03 16:07:00,17367,"If you want to cast like Jesus, used 6lb, lol!"
972237,manitoubass2,2016-06-03 16:23:00,11391,"Yessir.  Op thinks 12lb casts good???  6lb youll cast across a lake??? dont even need a boat. Cast over the first lake and the portage.  Capt, with nanofil get ready for dead accurate casting."
972257,porkpie,2016-06-03 18:14:00,2521,"I use 10lb, it casts as far as I need it to.  Use a leader, either mono or fluoro, whatever makes you happier.  Otherwise you'll have line loss due to fraying, especially with zebra mussels.  It's good stuff, and my favorite next to powerpro."
972259,GBW,2016-06-03 18:53:00,8460,My 12 year old daughter cast's 3/4 up the lake (4 mile lake) using #8 nanofil line so #6 means she'd be hitting Balsam... lol

972277,captpierre,2016-06-03 20:40:00,2521,Too many muskies around to dink around with 6-8 lb.
972282,manitoubass2,2016-06-03 21:15:00,11391,Thats a good reason lol
972285,misfish,2016-06-03 21:30:00,29133,"Too many muskies around to dink around with 6-8 lb.  Yup, and yup, quote works too.LOL"
972290,aplumma,2016-06-03 21:58:00,6896,If you really want to improve distance put a set of Boca bearings in.    http://www.bocabearings.com/bearing-applications/fishing-reel-bearings   Art
972293,misfish,2016-06-03 22:12:00,29133,If you really want to improve distance put a set of Boca bearings in.    http://www.bocabearings.com/bearing-applications/fishing-reel-bearings   Art  You lost me there Art.
972301,manitoubass2,2016-06-03 22:49:00,11391,"Ebec 9 is where its at for bearings, oh and ceramic  Think skateboarding lol  (Powell swiss) is what we use in skateboard wheels"
972304,misfish,2016-06-03 22:55:00,29133,"Bearings have nothing to do with casting a spinning reel. LOL  Now if your talking a pin/float,bait cast reel, I can see the point here."
972312,backbay,2016-06-03 23:18:00,773,"I have 10 lb on a light setup I've been using this spring but I've noticed the fraying too. Casts a mile, though"
972315,manitoubass2,2016-06-03 23:47:00,11391,"True,but why not mention it?  Gotta keep the sponsors happy with active posts right?"
972316,manitoubass2,2016-06-03 23:48:00,11391,Its dental floss man! Its horrible for abrasion resistance lol.  Other than that its friggen perfect line IMO
972333,DRIFTER_016,2016-06-04 02:43:00,10439,
972402,aplumma,2016-06-04 20:19:00,6896, You lost me there Art. Sorry my goof  I haven't used a spinning reel in 20 years. I use baitcasters which with a set of ceramic bearings will cast 30-50% further than factory bearing.   Art
972414,misfish,2016-06-04 21:53:00,29133,"Sorry my goof  I haven't used a spinning reel in 20 years. I use baitcasters which with a set of ceramic bearings will cast 30-50% further than factory bearing.   Art  No worries Art. I was just wondering where you were coming from.  As for the palomar knot, braid to floro, to each thier own. I tie my baits palomar, but use uni to uni when going from braid to floro or mono. If I cant pull it apart, it will hold. As it did well this morning."
972448,Joeytier,2016-06-05 01:27:00,3990,"Why should I opt for this over powerpro?  Just curious as I've never tried it, but I certainly don't feel like I need to increase my casting distance, 8 or 10 lb PP on the right rod will cast a country mile."
972449,manitoubass2,2016-06-05 01:38:00,11391,You really dont to be honest.  PP is a better all around line
972462,davey buoy,2016-06-05 11:40:00,5505,"PP for me,tried a few,works well enough I won't change.Great info though."
972466,singingdog,2016-06-05 12:50:00,1047,"Glad you guys like the nano. I tried it from 10 right down to 4 lb and it was nothing but trouble. Yes, you get 10% more casting distance, but knot failure and general poor handling - compared to PPro - weren't worth it for me."
973256,Dabluz,2016-06-11 19:35:00,701,I've been using 4 lb test Nano for a few years now and it's great.  Got some 8 lb test the other day and I am still deciding which reel I will put it on.  I ordered 2 spools for my Shimano Stradic 1000 and will maybe install the Nano on one of the spools.
