972842,glen,2016-06-08 18:04:00,2641,I put gold in the money pit just so they would keep digging.
972843,JoshS,2016-06-08 18:10:00,729,"I'd buy properties on Georgian Bay, LOTW, maybe something with boat parking close to st clair, something by the larry and a villa down south with fantastic marlin, tarpon, and whatever else bites down there fishing. Maybe purchase that really expensive ranger or two amongst a few other toys. I'd learn how to invest like a pro and spend a ton of hours on the water!"
972847,manitoubass2,2016-06-08 18:42:00,11391,"Id buy a nice place on rainy lake and another on LOTWs.  2 new boats, a few side by sides, two new trucks and thats about it.  A nice vacation once or twice a year and set the kids up good.  Id have alot of toys but not much would change"

972907,Dara,2016-06-09 02:37:00,3052,Really not much would change for me. I'm 5 years from retiring and likely would right away Kids have it made right now. Both have careers and school they love so that would just go on. I doubt I would move unless it was the 60 mil but charity would get most anyway.  Maybe build a windmill in Kathleen's back yard Just a bit more fishing and a bit of travel Life is pretty good as it is now
972912,DRIFTER_016,2016-06-09 02:56:00,10439,"Maybe build a windmill in Kathleen's back yard   With 50,000 whistles taped to the blades!!!!"

Since you cant be two places at once, id just rent spots down south on surf breaks whenever i felt like it.  invest a ton, pay for my future kid's educations. Buy myself a very nice car and a very nice pick up truck to pull my brand new alumacraft fully loaded.  Finally id drop 100 grand on the full exclusive private package at mark Wiegel heli ski...110 grand gets you a week for you and 11 other people to chopper around blue river BC in some of the best skiing in the world all inclusive.  oh and id buy myself a nice lil sled and a nice ATV  so...ive spent about 1.5 million...jeez i dont even need to hit the jackpot, i just gotta hit encore"

She was a wonderful person and she was on disability when she won in Hamilton due to her bad knees from slinging Beer for years.  I always wondered what I would do with all that money. After taking care of family and friends `I guess I would go fishing with Moosebunk or many here if they would have me along. Heck with that much coin I could have a building or Hospital ward with my name on it, Old Ironmaker's Physiological Wing for Old Steelworkers. I'd make Spiel CEO and M2B2 head chef.  What would you do with all those many millions if it came along?"

My Garmin sonar, Hummigbird combo and stereo face plate and was freaking out. Big flippin' deal. On the plus side maybe I can up grade to a bigger screen!!!!"

972725,kickingfrog,2016-06-07 21:51:00,8333,So many places to fish so little time. I'd fish/hunt my way from one end of this country to the other and then go top to bottom doing the same. During those travels I'd look for the perfect place to build a home to fish and hunt. On those rare times I wasn't fishing or hunting I'd travel the world.
972732,DRIFTER_016,2016-06-07 22:08:00,10439,South of the Artic circle? Don't forget your OFC pals.  Mostly. Would need a little place in Alaska and BC but the rest would be in tropical places where the fishing is insane.

Or are you being sarcastic about bad news? Congrats if the first, good vibes flying your way if the latter.  I've often thought about it. First thing would be to divide it into 5 equal amounts; one for me, one for my wife, and one for each of our three children. From my share I would give a significant portion to my brother and sister. Then I would start some serious industrial-strength relaxing.  Travel? Definitely. I would love to retrace Darwin's voyage on the Beagle, and perhaps take a camera crew and have it broadcast live. Next, Australia and New Zealand would receive extensive nature study and pub crawling. Then the British Isles from top to bottom, east to west. That small area has an incredible mix of geological structure. And pubs. Oh, and the Whisky Trail in Scotland.  Canada would not be missed. A lazy boat trip along the Trent-Severn from end to end, the Rideau, and all around the Great Lakes. lots of interesting small towns to experience. And pubs.  Newfoundland, always wanted to see L'Anse aux Meadows, the Viking settlement. And I hear there are some great pubs.  Lots of plans, lots of plans... But no money."

I already own a truck, so wouldn't need to buy anything to tow with.  the rest, put away for retirement"

After taking care of family and friends `I guess I would go fishing with Moosebunk or many here if they would have me along.  Don't need the lotto, just need the gas money to get up to Ottawa John.   While driving with my youngest the other day she asked the same question. Needing to be the responsible parent I explained investing... interest... credit and potential. Hoping of course that she (like her sister) would begin the think about savings as, she is the quick spender of the two.  If I won the Lotto I know a small percentage would be spent from the start, but otherwise it would be invested wisely, as that's what has really helped our family along since Bren and I started doing the same in my mid 20's."

Take a dull fillet knife and insert it into the urethra, then give it a good jab into the Bladder, then twist 360 degrees for 5 minutes. Then piss razor blades for a few days. Quit smoking now,    That's the smart thing to do with coin. Those kids have a leg up with you guiding them. We had a place south of Pembroke on the Ottawa Westmeath, actually north looking on a map, a special place in this world let alone Canada."

I'd have to say I'd invest a rather large amount in both my kids names and they cannot touch it till a higher education has been completed (so say by 25 yrs old?).  If said investments paid off they would have more then ever needed but there would be ground rules in place like 'must continue to work and not just spend the free cash till you're broke and then find a job'.  Then of course my parents would be set too.  Let them tell me what they need as I'm SURE I COST A WHOLE LOT TO THEM growing up...  Then I find some me time, maybe the pub?  HA!  Travel across Canada 1st and foremost to keep the money I spend and share here.  That would be a year long trip only.  I've been where I want to travel mostly other then 2 places.  England and Ireland.  I'd be booking to go there for a bit and play some golf at the historical courses, have a beer in said pub on site and then go fishing there (in said pub and out of the pub if you get my point).  Then to invest more for me, like maybe a few investment homes around the GTA and in the 705.  Find a cottage for me and the kids and get a new Ranger with all the toys.  I know all that is a dream as I just don't have the luck to win... Oh and I'd need to start and buy a ticket to play too!"

I thought about that, but nixed it. The higher education would be nice, and I wouldn't object, but, so long as they appear to be handling the whole windfall idea with some maturity (they're all legal adults now) I would probably object to them getting a job. It sounds noble, at first, to tell them to get some experience in the working world, but there is one problem: They won't need one, and some other poor slob will. I am assuming, of course, that the win would be enough to set them up for life. Let's say it was the $60 million biggie, that would make their share $12 million. Heck, you could bank that and live off the interest quite comfortably. Wise investing could give them a crapload more, so that when inflation inevitably eats into it, they would still be set."

Yes I have a list.  I would give 20 Million to the Shriner's hospital. They help all at no cost to the patients or family. They operate on donations .  I'd set up a trust fund of 10 million each for both of my children  That would leave me 3 million to do what ever I want. That's still a lot of money.  Maybe get a new truck and fish everyday like I used to when I was single."
