972342,Joey,2016-06-04 11:46:00,9122,"I have been buying lure parts from luremaking.com for years and through the years have formed a good relationship with the owner/manager Steve through some ups and downs of a few broken parts here and there, but also the great products he sells.  This year he offered to make me a set of blades, as he knows I love my photography, of any picture of mine I wanted, for free.  He said they bought a piece of equipment that lets them superimpose a picture onto a blade.  So I sent him a few of my fave pics and we agreed the Eagle I took a picture of a few years ago on Lake Nipissing turned out the best on the blade.  I received these in the mail yesterday.  #10 blades with my eagle pic.  Sweet!  Thanks Steve!!!  IMG_0109 by Joeyfishing, on Flickr"

972351,Joey,2016-06-04 12:25:00,9122,"LOL, yes they certainly will    Nope, Paul will have to go naked eared, or take his own pics and make a set of his own   Maybe some clip ons as his ears are not pierced"
