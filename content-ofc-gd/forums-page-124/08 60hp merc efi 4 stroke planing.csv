972205,hutch4113,2016-06-03 14:06:00,374,"a close friend has a 16 foot smoker craft with the four stroke merc and the thing wont plane with one person in the boat...  once it does get on plane it bounces around and feels like you are getting in a car wreck every time it hits a ripple...not a fan at all. Tell him to check the Prop he has installed - going to guess it has too much Pitch for the motor/boat setup.  When I bought my Smokercraft, it had a 23P prop installed - what I found out is that Marina's will often take the original prop off (or never got it on the sale) and will just install what they ""think"" will work.  So Plane took forever, top speed was great, but it would porpoise all over the place, and as you describe at the slightest ripple - generally speaking could not run it WOT.  I was going to go smart tabs, etc. - but decided first to properly size the Prop for the Motor and Boat. Big difference - does not hop around at all."

I would love to make the suggestion, but id feel bad talking negatively about the boat. probably best if i kept my thoughts to myself. its their first family boat, so im pretty sure they just dont know any better.  Exact same problem though, with 3 of us in the boat we have to do all sorts of maneuvering just to get the nose to sit down."

If the boat is under powered nothing is going to change that problem unless you remove the lard butt in the rear of the boat.......LOL

My live well is in the front so if I have 3 or 4 guys in the boat I just pump the live well full and that extra weight in the front makes a huge differance.

Just my opinion but if I spent $15K - $25K on a boat and couldn't take two buddies out, I'd be unhappy. I certainly realize hp choices play a huge part and this may be the issue here, but many of the subsequent posts are surprising."

It's on a 16'  smokercraft pro angler XL rated for max 75hp. I have the motor trimmed all the way down, and at WOT it will sit at 4000rpm no matter how much I trim up, eventually after about a half km the rpms will increase, get on plane and will hit 6000rpm. I have switched the factory prop from a 13 pitch to a 12 pitch and have a hydrofoil on the outboard. The motor runs very smooth and always starts first shot. Could there be any issues with it or is this just how it is with 3 guys? Thanks"
972098,Dara,2016-06-02 17:24:00,3052,I would say thats just how it is. My 60 yamaha is the same way  especially loaded and into the wind. Them 4 strokes just don't have the hole shot snap of a 2 stroke

972108,DanD,2016-06-02 18:17:00,2223,"Is the motor mounted at the proper height? With the motor trimed parallel to the keel, the bottom of the cavitation plate should be in-line with the keel. If the plate is to low, it can cause gear case drag and make it harder to get on plane and you'll loose some top end. If to high it can cause cavation and again make it harder to get on plane or the prop will just spin out. I been tolled no more then 3/4"" either above or below the keel. With you saying that the rpm stay low for a long time; I'm thinking the motor might be to low?  Dan."

972117,DRIFTER_016,2016-06-02 19:10:00,10439,"First a question: what do your RPM's max out at while running? You need to prop so you get close to max RPM to be running most efficiently. As stated check your motor height. Generally you want the cav plate to be level to 1"" below the bottom of the boat.  I have a couple of suggestions for after you check out motor height and WOT RPM.  1/ ditch the hydrofoil and replace with a pair of Smart Tabs. 2/Change out your 3 blade prop for a 4 blade."
972118,lifeisfun,2016-06-02 19:39:00,99,"I'll second the suggestion DRIFTER_016 gave you on smart tabs, have them and love them. http://www.nauticusinc.com/smart_tabsSX_automatic_trim_tabs.htm Make sure first that your motor is properly mounted as suggested by others above."

972122,shimano19,2016-06-02 20:24:00,196,"WOT is 6000 while on plane, when it's trying to get on plane with 3 people it will sit at 4000rpm and will randomly start climbing and hit 6000rpm. Boat planes quick and fine with 2 people. Cav plate sits level to bottom of boat. I've read of a lot of people having this issue. I think it's just a weight issue since it's good with 2 people. Was just wondering on everyone's insight"
972131,DRIFTER_016,2016-06-02 22:13:00,10439,By putting a set of smart tabs on it you will be able to get the back end to lift faster and hopefully pop up on plane faster. A 4 blade prop will also help getting out of the hole and up on plane more quickly. It does sound like your boat is pretty maxed out weight wise with 3 in the boat.

Less power than yours, but two stroke, and probably similar hull to yours as I think Smokercraft made Legend at that time (if not still).  Trimmed down, my boat won't plane out with 3 in it. When I feel it stall out a but I trim up a little at a time and she gets fully planed. Eventually.  My top speed is about 31-32 mph with 3 guys.  I'm guessing that you're just maxed out with 3 guys in the boat as it's currently setup.  If you get the trim tabs please let me know how they work. Maybe they'll work for me too."
