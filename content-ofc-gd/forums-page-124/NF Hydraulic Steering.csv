961449,mike rousseau,2016-03-08 06:07:00,4661,A bit of a side note  If any TILLER guys are reading this and are considering hydraulic steering for a big tiller it makes a HUGE difference.  I run a 50hp without I often drive my cousins 90hp with And I also use my brothers 115hp without  I can honestly say my old 9.9 and 25hp motors were harder to use then the 90hp with hydraulics...
972481,grimsbylander,2016-06-05 15:50:00,3016,"Better late than never...here's the update to my steering swap. I bought the hydraulic HK7400 steering kit and spent a good part of a day installing it. The toughest part was opening the hole in the console to accept the 3"" helm pump. But all in all, pretty easy install. The bleeding of the lines was straightforward as well. As mentioned, I also installed a jackplate so I'd have easier access to motor height adjustments. This made a huge difference to how the boat handles and has made pad to prop tuning dead easy.  I love the feeling of the steering...especially when small quick adjustments are necessary, like driving onto the trailer. Surprisingly, even at WOT the steering is extremely stable. Yesterday I was testing some adjustments I'd made and the boat tracked perfectly straight and I could let go a the wheel at 64 mph on the GPS. This was impressive, I expected it to be ""loose"".  I would hesitate to switch to hydraulic."
972493,Old Ironmaker,2016-06-05 18:11:00,8243,"The boys picked up a big boat last week that I want to go in on, 27 footer, 10 foot beam twin screws at 160HP each. At a price you can't refuse. The discussion is to go hydraulic steering so a Auto Pilot system can be installed. I'm voting hydraulic and Auto Pilot myself. No more being blown off the water often.  Thanks for the info guys, it will help greatly when we go hydraulics.  edit: I had the opportunity to run a 115HP tiller a few weeks back. I couldn't believe how effortless it was to turn that 300lbs or so of steel."
961181,grimsbylander,2016-03-07 00:43:00,3016,"Soft water is approaching and it's time to replace the steering on my boat. I timed it just perfectly; if I buy in the US, the exchange will kill me and if I buy in Canada, the Canadian suppliers have already jacked prices to more than compensate. ?  hydraulic steering is big bucks now!"
961183,aplumma,2016-03-07 00:49:00,6896,Yes it is but I will never have cables again. The ease of replacement made it easier to swallow. It took about 3 hours to do the conversion and the hardest part was removing the old stiff cables. The new ones are flexible lines that feed thru the hull area. The steering install of the pump is bolt in place. Check to see what adapters are needed for the motor. The end results where I did it at home and while it cost more than the cables it was cheaper than sending it to the shop to have them put in a set of cables.   Art
961220,Consigliere,2016-03-07 03:29:00,121,If you ever plan to add autopilot it is a must. Luckily used boat i got had it already. It's pretty sweet and much better long term.
961221,HTHM,2016-03-07 03:35:00,4082,"Another benefit is, if you fall overboard all the have to do is backtrack on your heading and they will find you. (What I am trying to say is that it will maintain a stable heading)"
961313,grimsbylander,2016-03-07 16:52:00,3016,"Thanks Art. I've never read anywhere that someone regretted going to hydraulic steering despite the cost. Since I won't be replacing my boat anytime soon, I might as well dive deep and spend the extra. I just got a quote this morning from a recommended US supplier of $880 USD for the Seastar Pro with 16' hoses shipped to Niagara Falls NY. That's about $1170 CDN, plus tax and the cost of crossing the border to get it. My Canadian pricing from a local marine supply has the same equipment at $2219.98 plus tax. That's a substantial difference I can't afford to absorb. I'll try to find a better price here before I pull the trigger but I doubt I'll get close."
961315,grimsbylander,2016-03-07 17:03:00,3016,"No autopilot in my future, but I have been eyeballing the Motorguide Xi5 trolling motors. Amazing tool for following a contour and ""anchoring""."
961316,hirk,2016-03-07 17:04:00,571,"U flex makes a really nice system too, maybe less $??? I have had hydraulic and dont really prefer it over cable, wouldnt bother me to have either system. A set of cables could be had for about $350"

I was looking at this myself recently and there is a slightly less expensive series than the Seastar Pro series for boats up to 150 HP.

If you get something shipped US post, will it skip through customs without brokerage and taxes?? Even at that price point?"

Well! Instead of physically crossing the border where I'll be paying the taxes regardless, maybe I should just get it shipped to me door and save the drive! Thanks guys"
961345,Old Ironmaker,2016-03-07 20:19:00,8243,"It will depend on the size of your boat to see the benefits of hydraulics. I changed my rack and pinion on my 19 footer last year and it feels like power steering now. Not an easy job since I didn't take the 115HP off to do it like every marine shop said they had too, not true. Rather than try and pull the old cable I just cut in sections with a bolt cutter. Making the 90 degree turn at the gunnel and transom was the challenge. I know a guy that went to hydraulic on a smaller aluminum and he doesn't see the difference."

I am running the seastar set up on a 350 commanche Ranger with a 150 and it runs great.The removal of the old cables are easy as mentioned by cutting them out but to get the new cables in you need to pull the motor or really fight to get them in.

Art  I disconnected the helm and cables a couple weeks ago and pulled the cables out. I tied a wire to each cable before I pulled them out so I have two wires in the gunnel I can use to pull the hoses through. I'll have to open up the hole on the console to accept the 3"" helm pump...should be fun. I imagine your Ranger console is similar to mine...it must be darn near an inch thick at one spot! I hope the bolts are long enough. Oh, and to add to the fun, I'm going to add a jackplate while I'm monkeying with it."
961401,hirk,2016-03-07 23:13:00,571,You will likely need a new wheel too or if your lucky just an adaptor
961405,grimsbylander,2016-03-07 23:29:00,3016,You will likely need a new wheel too or if your lucky just an adaptor  That I didn't know! I assume because the stem on the helm pump is different?
961406,DRIFTER_016,2016-03-07 23:32:00,10439," That I didn't know! I assume because the stem on the helm pump is different?  It depends on what you had for a steering system to begin with. Most boats tend to use the same types of helms (Tapered 3/4"" with key). If your old system used this then the wheel should fit."
961410,aplumma,2016-03-08 00:01:00,6896,  Here is the picture of the shaft with a 1/2 moon key. Remove your steering wheel nut and you can see a key down on the shaft in most cases.   Art

961424,Consigliere,2016-03-08 02:08:00,121,Ship USPS is key to avoid duty. Ups and others all have brokers so you are automatically charged duty to import. Insist on usps or get a Kinect account.
961432,irishfield,2016-03-08 03:14:00,26272,"I can't quote... but to answer Grimsby all packages with taxes and s/c require pick up at the postal outlet in our town. Mind you all packages do that won't fit in our site boxes. They take cash, cc and debit.  A small tip... when you order, put a ""Grimsby enterprises C/O your name, address, etc"". I have found over time that 85% of my packages addressed to a business only get nailed for 5% gst, but if they are in my name only they get hit for 13% hst 100% of the time."
