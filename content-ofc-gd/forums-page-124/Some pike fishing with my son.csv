Casting a blue/silver cyclops:   Trolling a husky jerk:   I caught a twin of ^that^ one casting a x-rap and we had 3 fish for dinner.  My son didn't get any pike into the boat but he did snag this casting one of his favourite lures (He bought it last year with his own money, then caught a pike with it the first time he used it, and no matter how much we suggested better pike choices he insisted on using it).

Having confidence in the lure your throwing is half the battle, lol  Looks like a great day on the water with family.  Ya, I have a few hundred lures and yet it's the same handful almost every trip. I had hoped that we'd catch a few quick pike and then he'd switch but since we didn't provide the evidence he never felt the need to change."
