972469,Rizzo,2016-06-05 13:12:00,4754,"Finally getting the boat out (tomorrow) for the first time. The plan was to go to St Clair out of Belle River. Winds are forecasted for 30 k out of the west. Any higher I dont go for sure. Any lower I do go for sure. That 30 just puts me in the ""What to do"" zone.  Not interested in driving farther and fishing Windsor area. My back up would be kawarthas instead. I am in a 16.5 foot alumacraft full windshield. Any thoughts?"
972473,davey buoy,2016-06-05 14:11:00,5505,"Not sure ,but Lake Simcoe 30km is a no no.Even 20km is a rough ride.If I am not mistaken isn't 20km small craft warning?. Be safe and good luck."
972483,misfish,2016-06-05 16:12:00,29133,Gonna have to get you up here for a fish Rog.
972486,Rizzo,2016-06-05 16:38:00,4754,ya...maybe tomorrow!
972487,landry,2016-06-05 16:38:00,1005,I would cancel at that speed and direction for sure. The fishing was terrible yesterday anyways for us and everyone we talked to. Detroit R may have been better?? Heard of one giant caught there.
972488,OhioFisherman,2016-06-05 16:43:00,6623,"I don't know Lake St Clair, but Lake Erie was a no no with a 20 mile an hour breeze in my 17 footer."
972492,Old Ironmaker,2016-06-05 18:00:00,8243,"Good choice not to go today. Every year my ""no go"" wind speeds are getting lower and lower. It is calling for very high winds here on Erie all week. 60KPH some afternoons. This week it looks like a bust here for fishing, this lake can kill you faster than a bullet as can many waters like Nipissing and Quinte when the wind is up. Pick your days."
972494,Rizzo,2016-06-05 18:15:00,4754,I wish I could pick my days. There is a reason tomorrow is my first day out! Lots of commitments will do that to a guy. Sounds like we may be heading to kawarthas if forecast doesn't change
972495,Old Ironmaker,2016-06-05 18:21:00,8243,"I hear you Rizzo, work and life can sure cut into fishing time. There was a time before all this information highway when we would head out sometimes a 6 hour or more return drive for the day and pray the water was fishable when we got there. Like Hamilton to Quinte and back or Hamilton to Port Severn just for the day. Sometimes is wasn't safe but it never stopped us dough heads."
972496,misfish,2016-06-05 18:50:00,29133,"I wish I could pick my days. There is a reason tomorrow is my first day out! Lots of commitments will do that to a guy. Sounds like we may be heading to kawarthas if forecast doesn't change   Although this city is starting to piss me off Rog, I do like the fact Im minutes away from Simcoe and short distance from many other lakes to fish."
972537,Rizzo,2016-06-05 23:40:00,4754,...don't let the city piss you off too much Brian...its a great spot. We left for other reasons but should life situations change I would return to Barrie in a heartbeat
972542,outllaw,2016-06-06 00:51:00,1232,west stay home I live here. b.rivers 10 miles from Detroit river. 10 miles to hump to b.r. 3-4ft waves.
972556,Rizzo,2016-06-06 02:01:00,4754,yup decision has been made...we are heading somewhere in kawarthas figure it out in the am!
972563,Joey,2016-06-06 03:20:00,9122,This day it was  
972565,Rizzo,2016-06-06 08:50:00,4754,good times been there done that not doing it today! Off to kawarthas we go
972577,Old Ironmaker,2016-06-06 13:11:00,8243,"Come on Joey, windy? that's just a nice Walleye chop here on Erie."
972689,boombap,2016-06-07 20:17:00,310,Would love to see how my 16.5 deep v would handle that
972700,Old Ironmaker,2016-06-07 21:01:00,8243,"I remember a time that there wasn't bumper to bumper traffic around Barrie. When it was ""Up North"". I couldn't drive there everyday now. It is really a suburb of T.O. now. When I go to Hamilton now I always say there is more cars on this corner and gridlock than all the cars in Haldimand County. I spent most of my adult life downtown Hammertown. I just cleaned the floors at our place and there were bird feathers on the floor. I never found bird feathers even on the 37th floor of my place in Century 21 in Hamilton. Bird feathers, look at what your cat dragged in my dear one."
