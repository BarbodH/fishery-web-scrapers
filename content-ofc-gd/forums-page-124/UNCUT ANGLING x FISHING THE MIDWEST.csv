972273,AKRISONER,2016-06-03 20:21:00,5558,"weibe consistantly catches monsters and he doesnt eff around with camera cuts and Bull. He will straight up tell you if hes getting skunked, or if hes catching them first cast. dudes my all time fave pro angler,"

972568,manitoubass2,2016-06-06 09:06:00,11391,"Always love these.  Wish the other guy showed some enthusiasm lol.  Weibe is a boss  Ive fished falcon. It has some BIG pike. When he hooks the pike, if ya look to the right and down the shoreline, there is a lil feeder creek there that just stacks fish"
972578,Moosebunk,2016-06-06 13:18:00,3970,Always watch Uncut. Great stuff every time.
972590,netminder,2016-06-06 15:29:00,514,"that was a quality episode. I might be showing my ignorance here, but is there a reason they were grabbing at those laker's tails and not netting them? It would have been hilarious (for everyone but him) if the hook suddenly came out and caught him in the face. He already took a hook to the finger. Just seems like the safer alternative."
972592,PUMP KNOWS,2016-06-06 15:43:00,937,"^^^ yea, I didn't get that part.  Using the net would've been so much easier.  Here's another one  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2lSUQjN-EI"
