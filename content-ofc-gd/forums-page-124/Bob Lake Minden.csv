972184,stasbrute,2016-06-03 11:06:00,206,"Thank you for the info Chris, the MNR website only mentions smallmouth bass, no mention of largies......."
972223,msp,2016-06-03 15:25:00,1336,I fished it one a few years ago. We caught so many stunted smallmouth it became annoying. Didn't catch any largemouth but heard that they are in there
972309,esoxansteel,2016-06-03 23:07:00,1307,"Go for the smallies and lakers, largemouths are swamp donkeys anyways, and god made largemouths for people who cant real fish"
