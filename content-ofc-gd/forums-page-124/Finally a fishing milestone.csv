973172,esoxansteel,2016-06-10 17:38:00,1307,"Thanks everybody. It was quite the adrenaline rush. She took some hard runs too, my wife wasn't sure which side to take the net since it was back and forth.  I had another BIG one turn on a figure 8 today but just wouldn't open it's mouth. 3 follows and no takers, first time I've been skunked in 6 trips but I don't even care right now lol.   She showed you where she is, pick your time and she will bite,"
972916,Dontcryformejanhrdina,2016-06-09 10:29:00,535,"Well I started out musky fishing in 2011. I didn't know what I was doing but this board helped me out a lot. Special shout of to Mike Rousseau, the day we got out fishing was a real learning experience. I was still stuck on that 44.5"" musky as my personal best, though. I was catching fish, just nothing big. That changed yesterday.          My first 50"" fish!"
972917,DanD,2016-06-09 10:34:00,2223,Nice fish!!!! Congrats.  I see you still have the same boat; I sure do miss that thing.  Dan.
972918,Dontcryformejanhrdina,2016-06-09 10:38:00,535,She's been awful good to me Dan. Though she's not as pretty as she once was.
972921,DanD,2016-06-09 11:10:00,2223,"She's been awful good to me Dan. Though she's not as pretty as she once was.  All that means is that you're getting good use out of her.  Congrats again on the 50""er!!!  Dan."

I heard yesterday was a crazy day on the water everywhere. Something about that kind of early summer weather pattern that gets animals revved up I guess. Got that big girl to eat!
