972899,dave524,2016-06-09 01:14:00,4508,"I believe they are both trout lakes, lakers and specs. Just before you get to them you will find Louie and Little Louie Lakes, I remember a couple of trips with dad were we caught lots of specs up to 3 or so pounds in Louie predominantly but that was in the mid sixties with the canoe on top of the 64 Pontiac wagon on Victoria Day weekend."

Shame, fond memories of that area as youth. Thanks, for bringing back the memory of a great trip with dad, still got the 308 Mitchell and Heddon Pal ultralight I bought for those trips,  http://www.muskokawaterweb.ca/images/mnr/Louie_Lake.pdf  http://www.muskokawaterweb.ca/images/mnr/crown_lake.pdf  http://www.muskokawaterweb.ca/images/mnr/Wolf_Lake_Livingstone.pdf"
