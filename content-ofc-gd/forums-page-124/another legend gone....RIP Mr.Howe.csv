973149,AKRISONER,2016-06-10 15:19:00,5558,"man, i swear something about this year is really crazy...like some big names are going in one big clump..  I cannot recall a year where so many people that I really hold close dying in such a short span of time. Seems like every day the past few weeks someone dies.  Malik the 5 foot freak, prince, ali, gordie, gord Tragically hip gets brain cancer...even kimbo slice died this week and I was a big fan of dude...what the heck is going on!"
973152,fishing n autograph,2016-06-10 15:44:00,2540,Kimbo needed a new heart though. He kept his health condition quiet

973160,manitoubass2,2016-06-10 16:24:00,11391,"Nah those have been around for a long time.  But thats impressive! Especially in an era when many players drank and smoked like chimneys!  Never knew he liked to fish? One more reason to like him  I think it aired last season but anyone remember as his health was failing, they had a show during an intermission that showed him with his family? How close they were and how awesome of a parent, great grand parent he was. I really enjoyed seeing that.  RIP Mr. Hockey"
973191,npt1,2016-06-10 20:34:00,220,"Gordie  loved fishing, I have a vhs show of him and Red Fisher on a trip . He was my hero when I was a boy, never missed an episode of ""Hockey Night In Canada""  years ago when the original 6 played great games. R.I.P.  Mr. Hockey."
