The other one is just north of there on the same side of the lake. Don't know of any on the other lakes. Watch for zebra mussels if you want to swim from any rocky shore. They tear up the feet pretty good. I would second anchoring around the islands on Upper Buckhorn. I hate the deer flies.  They are not as bad on the north end of Pigeon."
973009,AKRISONER,2016-06-09 21:04:00,5558,"muskys on pigeon for sure...Gannon narrows always shows the skis  dont shy away from crankbaits, maybe you could feed a few mouths on some walters."
973170,ichan,2016-06-10 17:21:00,8,"make sure the driver watch the map, stay in the main channel, on pigeon, all the green markers are within 20 feet of very big and shallow rock shoals, pulled a few boats and houseboats off them over the years, quick way to ruin a weekend"
973174,Mister G,2016-06-10 17:50:00,1429,Make sure you guys take the INSURANCE option on that boat .........
973187,jimmer,2016-06-10 18:46:00,2730,"Yes, there are some rock shoals on the south side of Big Island that can get you. Three Sisters Shoals and Hurricane Point are others to watch for."
973216,FishFinder17,2016-06-11 01:21:00,139,"Thanks for the tips guys.  I may change the route a bit based on your advice. I'm thinking we might spend a night on big island, then next day head through gannons narrows and spend a night tied up to one if the islands just outside the narrows. From there we can head up to Buckhorn or just stay in that area. I'm hearing the muskie fishing on pigeon/buckhorn will be best..."
973229,GBW,2016-06-11 03:34:00,8460,"There are some decent numbers of musky in Sturgeon (all sizes) as EC and I seem to find those buggers while walleye fishing...  One we never seen but I hooked into burnt out the drag on an Ardent reel in NO TIME and EC was on the electric motor full speed to keep up with it too, then it decides to hunker down and *ping* it was gone....  Good luck and have FUN!"
973235,Hank Jr,2016-06-11 11:49:00,146,I vote for Sturgeon its one of my favorite lakes and most of the time doesn't get the pressure Pigeon does . We do well on numbers and size . I sent you a PM hope it helps some . Have a safe trip .
964411,Tom McCutcheon,2016-03-30 00:24:00,627,"Do what we did one time, head to the sand bar on pigeon and set up for 3 days  That's about a five minute trip from Happy Days.......  If you are doing some fishing with the smaller boat and using the houseboat as a base camp, you could cruise around the North end of Pigeon on the first day and then stay on the East side of Boyd Island (big island) that night. The next morning after breakfast, use the small boat for fishing while the Mother Ship heads to Buckhorn lock. Meet up there and depending on time of day lock through or spend the night. Once on Lower Buckhorn you might need to visit a marina for a pump out (that's two full days and nights of 11 guys on board) something to keep an eye on. You can fish and cruise Lower Buckhorn all day, but if you need to be back at Happy Days by a certain time on the fourth day, it will take you a few hours of cruising to get back after you have locked back into Upper Buckhorn. No problem with the smaller boat, but if the prevailing westerly winds are up, it will slow the Mother Ships return. Be careful on Pigeon Lake with the smaller boat if the winds are up. It can sometimes get quite nasty. I live on Pigeon and have had some white knuckle rides in an 18 foot Lund. Just use your common sense in that case."
964459,FishFinder17,2016-03-30 13:39:00,139,"Thanks Tom, I like the idea of using the houseboat as base camp. We probably won't spend any full days fishing since it's only a few of us that are into it but definitely will start each day in the tracker .  How concerned should I be about hazards/rocks heading out to the east? I know how to navigate a lake but I don't want to put any pressure on some of the less experienced guys who will likely do some driving.  And thanks for the heads up on Pigeon winds. I had the tracker out there last September and it was not a fun ride once the winds picked up. Scared the hell out of my buddy lol!  Again, thanks all for the help!  FF17"
964461,Tom McCutcheon,2016-03-30 14:07:00,627,"I am not sure what the houseboat will have as far as instrumentation, but if it has a fish finder/GPS combo, you will be fine. I am also pretty sure there will be paper charts on board as well. These you can study over a cold beverage and plan your next days travel. The preferred waterways are well marked and just stay within those boundaries and let the inexperienced guys operate here. When proceeding towards an overnight anchorage or lock, go slow and have a lookout on the front deck/rail of the houseboat and one on the back with an experienced person at the helm. Not all the hazards are marked. If the houseboat doesn't supply a pair of binoculars it would be a good idea to bring your own.  Don't worry too much about it. These things are built like tanks and take a lot of abuse. A lot of NEW TO BOATING renters have the use of these vessels every year. A few props get damaged and it is all part of the experience. Depending on how badly they are bent, you may lose a damage deposit and this should be discussed amongst all the boys beforehand so no one (YOURSELF) is stuck holding the bag at the end of your trip."
964464,KLINKER,2016-03-30 15:13:00,256,Might want to make sure the guys know how to use the anchor and spring lines and vhf if it has one.

And as far a damage, they will KILL you on that end...........DON'T damage anything and they will also COUNT all your silverware, plates, pans, etc.............they are not in business to have endless supplies of anything on the boat.........you will also be responsible for anchors and pipe poles, etc..............so keep a eye on everything."

The lake is very scenic and boasts some good fishing for bass and musky as well as walleye and panfish and does have lots of sheltered bays where I often see houseboats tied up for the evenings but again getting into those areas is risky so be careful and have fun.

965271,Tom McCutcheon,2016-04-05 00:23:00,627,"The trip to get below Burleigh Falls would take the better part of a day with the houseboat. It all would depend on how busy the locks are at Buckhorn and Burleigh Falls. I would think that if you got underway from an anchorage off Boyd by 8:00 am you could easily make the lock in Burleigh Falls by late afternoon (without side trips). Ask about fuel consumption at Happy Days and judge accordingly if you can make the trip with what you have in the tank, from Boyd Island to the Falls without having to stop for fuel. It's not that far by water. It just takes time to get past several speed limit zones and the locks. Not as though the houseboat needs to slow down a lot.......LOL. But it will use more fuel if you are running wide open."
