972676,mr blizzard,2016-06-07 17:57:00,1589,"Bunk as usual a shear pleasure to read, pics are awesome but I have to admit I am a little partial to your fishing machine, you have in your words ""pimped it out"" very well sweet looking boat for sure, well done  Sorry u did not get up this way for some summer work but I am sure we will share a meal when u get up here again, hopefully fall into winter  Say hi to all the family and again thanks for sharing a most pleasurable read"
972687,Old Ironmaker,2016-06-07 20:03:00,8243,"Fantastic as expected from all of us living vicariously through your exploits. In other words I'm jealous Johnny,,,,, again."
972701,AKRISONER,2016-06-07 21:01:00,5558,"reading about your new boat makes me think so much about ""tinner magic"" back home in ontario...its sitting waiting for me to come back...almost brings a tear to my eye.  Ive also done the casting deck, bow mount trolling motor rig...i really like your approach. We did it a little different mounting to a piece of wood on a bracket at the front and then bolting down. Same kind of idea though. We tried using plasti dip, but the moisture in the wood has caused a few problems so I will be thinking of a more permanent solution in the near future.  I might just have to steal your idea."
972763,Moosebunk,2016-06-08 01:03:00,3970,"Sorry u did not get up this way for some summer work but I am sure we will share a meal when u get up here again  John... I'll be staying in the usual hotel for a night late July while rolling through for work and Arctic char.   See ya then.  Fantastic as expected from all of us living vicariously through your exploits. In other words I'm jealous Johnny,,,,, again.  Well, keep it only at jealousy please John... I fear that it could turn to hate as it has with some in the past.  I might just have to steal your idea.  Thought some of the ideas were worth posting about. Steal away.  Nice thing about having that removable casting deck is, I can store it in the winter and store things underneath it in the summer, and get at the trolling motor battery easily.   Thanks gang!"
972784,BITEME,2016-06-08 03:13:00,1968,Always cool outings Beautiful family And really nice job on the boat!!!!!!!  Cheer Peter

972788,manitoubass2,2016-06-08 03:40:00,11391,"Sweet lil rig and fantastic exploits!  Please come through NW ontario sometime lol. Lets fish!  As usual, amazing report and I know for a fact its not just that dirty italian thats jealous?"
972790,chris.brock,2016-06-08 04:15:00,4053," Happy belated 40th Bunk! 40 is kind of an ugly number when you're 38 or 39, I thought anyway.  Cool old canoe and nice new boat.  You're still living the dream as I can see from all the other pictures and stories."
972794,adempsey,2016-06-08 04:44:00,1498,"Very nice!  Always enjoy your gar exploits.   Love the boat build.  I vote for ""Headstone"" or ""Gravestone"" given the ""death"" of WarCanoe."
972796,manitoubass2,2016-06-08 05:14:00,11391,"Nme, my vote for a name?"
972800,wormdunker,2016-06-08 06:57:00,1711,"Nice job on your new ride.  I love doing my own projects as well.  The gar pix are awesome, but I really like the walleye.  I'm a walleye hunter. Happy birthday!"
972811,BassMan11,2016-06-08 12:17:00,583,"Another stellar report Bunk.  The fishing portion is epic as per usual,  but I really like that boat build as my main rig is something very similar. You can get a decent tiller handle extension at Chandlery in town if the short arm really bother you. I have one on my Honda 30 tiller that works fairly well.  Happy hunting"
972841,JoshS,2016-06-08 17:56:00,729,Nice breakdown of the spring adventures. Sweet job on the rig as well.
972903,PUMP KNOWS,2016-06-09 01:21:00,937,Nice multispecies!
972914,spincast,2016-06-09 09:24:00,3279,"enjoyed reading that over the morning coffee - making the most of what life has to offer, excellent"
972945,Moosebunk,2016-06-09 14:20:00,3970,"Please come through NW ontario sometime lol. Lets fish!  I hope to someday soon Rick, and would certainly look you up.  Good friend of mine moved out that way couple years ago and I have to get out to see him.  Happy belated 40th Bunk! 40 is kind of an ugly number when you're 38 or 39, I thought anyway.  Thanks man!  And I have seen a couple of those interesting pics of specks floating around with you in 'em.  You'll have to write that one up Chris.  Very nice!  Always enjoy your gar exploits.   Love the boat build.  I vote for ""Headstone"" or ""Gravestone"" given the ""death"" of WarCanoe.  Headstone... do like that.  I have no clue so far really.  Boaty McBoatFace, who knows..? lol  You can get a decent tiller handle extension at Chandlery in town if the short arm really bother you. I have one on my Honda 30 tiller that works fairly well.  Gonna bookmark this little tidbit of info dood!  Good to know. I would like to extend it a foot or so.   Thanks for reading gang!"
973231,Steelheadphycho,2016-06-11 04:51:00,470,You've done it again Bunk and the good ship lolli-GAR! Is quite the build. Nice work! Always enjoy your contributions!
973234,Guidofisherman,2016-06-11 10:57:00,206,"Always one of my favourite reads. Enjoyed the family trip, fishing adventures and boat pimp. By the way...the fish'n trip with your mentor is now set. Hope to make it a success for him."
973248,Fisherpete,2016-06-11 15:47:00,1814,"Always love the gar reports Bunk - been on my bucket list for a while now. Great photography as always!Love the boat pimp too - I pretty much did the same with my 16' Legend Prosport. Having floors was the key, mine had a livewell and lights as a bonus. I'm still tweaking it after 5 years! Might just have to do up a report too to show what I have done to make the ""Muskie Whisperer"" into my fishing machine.Pete"
973267,Joey,2016-06-12 01:29:00,9122,"Once again, simply amazing report!"
973290,Moosebunk,2016-06-12 13:42:00,3970,"Thanks guys, and Joey.   Always one of my favourite reads. Enjoyed the family trip, fishing adventures and boat pimp. By the way...the fish'n trip with your mentor is now set. Hope to make it a success for him.  Went looking for a pic of me at home here pre-digital taken the first day I ever sat in a float tube, held a fly rod and fished specks.  In the pic I'm also holding a homebrew... which is a no-no and a first tough lesson to float tubing. (nowhere to pee)  John (my friend's father) taught me 10 and 2, a little rhythm and tied a black/brown/red Mickey Finn onto the end of my line.  A remote portage lake in Zec Dumoine, I trolled awhile in the tube with that setup and hooked my first speck ever, and when the fish started to rise later on I tied up an Adams and missed hooking a couple fish that sipped it up on the surface. John's enthusiasm not only to fish but to fish speckled trout, is comparable to only a few people I have known since. From the west, You, Dan and Randy are a few of those people.  John will be happy with however the day unfolds Al, and thanks again for hosting my old friend who first allowed me the opportunity to fish specks.  Might just have to do up a report too to show what I have done to make the ""Muskie Whisperer"" into my fishing machine.  You should. Those kinds of posts are always good to read no matter.  But, I betchya the Whisperer is done up just right... especially for toothies."
