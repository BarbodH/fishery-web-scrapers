846081,chefboi17,2014-04-06 23:49:00,128,"I'm so down, it would be something else to hook into a steelhead on one of those setups lol"
846087,manitoubass2,2014-04-07 00:08:00,11391,I'm down but got no dollarama near me:( can one of you good folks from the south hook me up if we do this tourney? Looks like the funniest thing ever!
846095,HTHM,2014-04-07 00:27:00,4082,Perhaps we could make it part of Fishing for a Cure? I'll leave that choice to Dan.
846142,GBW,2014-04-07 02:23:00,8460,I'll hook you up Manitou if needed. from the looks of the thread coming back to life I need to go again soon
846148,Gallie,2014-04-07 03:29:00,1215,I think i could troll up a simcoe pike with one of those combos...
973249,shawnboyfishing,2016-06-11 15:50:00,1,Nothing wrong with dollarama lures. All you need to do is change the hooks and your good to go!
973250,manitoubass2,2016-06-11 16:01:00,11391,Thank ya sir!  Really wanna do this! Would be a blast!
973257,Rodbender,2016-06-11 19:49:00,1027,OMG this is a great Idea for a boys weekend a 4 hour tourney I just happen to have one comming up June 24 25 26 on Nosbonsing I'm gonna pitch this Idea to a few tonight
973263,Old Ironmaker,2016-06-11 21:36:00,8243,"Thanks for resurrecting this thread. How did you find it?  It's nice to see some names that were regulars here but have disappeared. I don't know of Dollarama still sells that crappola tackle. It's just as effective as my 17 buck Live Target crappolla. I have gotten some great deals at the Sally Ann in Dunnville on tackle. Nothing lately.  Maybe a tourney for tackle that are antique now. Daredevils, Original 5 of Diamonds. Rappala's that say $2.99 from Towers, I would never want to lose that baby as I took it out of Len Malloni's tackle box years ago and it was old then. Sadly he passed last year. I miss him big time."
973292,G.mech,2016-06-12 14:12:00,830,"OMG this is a great Idea for a boys weekend a 4 hour tourney I just happen to have one comming up June 24 25 26 on Nosbonsing I'm gonna pitch this Idea to a few tonight  We used to do a pike tourney up at the camp where each guy got a boat, a spinning reel spooled with 50 yds of 6 lb mono, 2 wire leaders, and 2 lures of their choice.  Most lbs of pike caught before you lost your gear won.  There were some monster pike there and you kind of had to avoid them.  It was fun trying to drive the boat and fight a fish who was about to spool you but you'd be surprised how many decent fish were landed."
376769,bigugli,2009-08-26 15:45:00,6138,"Finally got my D'rama special out for a workout and do some jigging.  The jigs worked fine. One willing victim:   Unfortunately, there are 2 very large smallies with jigs stuck in their yaps. The line was far too brittle to hold a larger fish. I saw both. Almost had the one in the net. The bamboo pole, wrapped in duct tape, held up quite well. The reel doesn't cast for snot."
376784,Jonny,2009-08-26 16:27:00,1380," I was wondering how you'd make out with your ""home-made"". After all that effort in trying to find stuff, and jury-rigging, you got yourself an entry. Good show!"
377043,Cudz,2009-08-27 06:32:00,2652,"This has to be my fave pic so far this year.  To most people it doesn't look like much, but if you own this set up (which I do) you will know how rediculous this is.  lol.  I love it!"
377051,Fish Farmer,2009-08-27 10:25:00,2234,"Cudz I hope it stands up today, Chasing Rainbows off 50 Pt. I think it will be the last time I see the rod.   Will post verdict  I didn't get out on lake O, to rough  , went to Erie, should have stayed home, no luck on the Walleye. Lost 1 at the boat."
377620,bigugli,2009-08-29 02:44:00,6138,"Worked the D'rama special hard again. Ths smallies and gills really like them micro jigs they sell. I was having a ball jigging with the big cane pole. Had more than a couple of strange looks from folks passing by. Who cares I was catching a lot of fish.   The biggest to be landed at 12 1/2""    Had another go at one of the big smallies, the old jig still stuck in the side of his face. I even though I had him beat but one last run and snap.   Here's tomorrow's dinner guests.  A good number more went back before my evening was done. Good thing I always have 2 or 3 rods with me when backpacking."
377623,bigugli,2009-08-29 02:46:00,6138,D'OH!
377662,Fish Farmer,2009-08-29 04:00:00,2234,"No more dollarama tackle for me  , I've just witnessed one of their rods break   Bigugli, you gave it a work out  . Plus a fry to boot."
378658,Cudz,2009-09-01 01:03:00,2652,"I finally have an entry but with a bit of a tragic story. I busted out the dollarama gear and I tried to cast a bit.  Anyone who owns one of these reels knows that they don't cast worth a crap and they reel in the line even worse.  At $2 per reel I feel somehow I got fleeced.  Anyway, bad reel aside, I decided to troll one my baits that kind of looks like a little big O.  It was doing well and I had a fish on but lost it.  A few minutes later I got another hit and manged to land a 12.99"" smallie.  I don't think this combo can actually handle much more than that unless in the hands of a fishing Magician (TJ).   My line was a mess and I ended up hand bombing the fish in for the last 10ft or so. After landing the fish I was eager to get my nait back in the water but it would not run true.  It kept surfacing behind the boat.  The eye which connects to the line had come loose and made the bait spiral.  I tried trolling my other lures but no luck.  I had good intentions to start jigging when an unfortunate accident ended my dollarama dream.  My reel broke apart. Here are my pics.  Two easy perch and I could have won this thing. the setup  The fish (note birds nest line)  The measurement  The carnage "
378682,MCTFisher9120,2009-09-01 01:47:00,3761," lol, the birds nest and the last pic made me chuckle....lol good job on the bass"
378720,bigugli,2009-09-01 03:24:00,6138,"Well I gave one more kick at the can. I cannibalized the cane pole and still had a 44"" pole to work with. So I strapped the reel onto it and headed to my little honey hole for some more jigging.  the bass and blue gills really like the D'rama micro jigs. Lost a lot more using the short stick with absolutely no bend or flex. Pulled the hook out a few times.   My biggie of the evening  Shortly after, my reel collapsed. The Plastic holding the bail wire snapped off, ending my D'rama adventure for good this time. Certainly a neat challenge.  So I ended up with 3 bass: 10"", 12 1/2"" , and another 12"" tonight"
378723,Jonny,2009-09-01 03:35:00,1380,"I was planning one more shot with the crap gear but it was too windy to get the boat out today.  So the reel gets thrown in the trash, the rod gets emergency status or given away, the baits I'll continue to use once in a while."
378747,Fish Farmer,2009-09-01 11:43:00,2234,"Don't matter if it's over, still going to rigger fish this excellent tackle  and will post results. That is the fun part. With any luck it'll make Quinte Cudz When will the second annual Dollarama be held Cudz, maybe you should get yourself some Dallorama Crazzzy Glue"
378768,Cudz,2009-09-01 12:44:00,2652,I am going to get another reel.  I am going to get another lure as well.  I want to catch a 4+ bass on the rig.  I love the rigger pics.  Youhave to ctch something.  Be prepared to hand line it in though.
378781,Cudz,2009-09-01 13:01:00,2652,"Here are the official unofficial result of the Dollarama Derby.  It was a cut-throat tournament that went down to the wire.  One agler ros above all others to claim the title.  Congrats to Bigugli with a total of 34.5""!!!  Congrats to T.J. Quesnel with the Big fish of the tournament a 15.5"" smallmouth! Lots of broken equipment and lots of should have could stories.  Good job to those who actually participated and tried to catch fish on such qualiyt equpment. Here are the results: Fisherman - number of fish - total length 1. Bigugli          3 fish   34.5"" 2. T.J. Quesnel  2 fish   25.5"" 3. Fish Farmer   1 fish   13"" 4.

378787,JohnF,2009-09-01 13:13:00,3494, Weren't you worried about the tape invalidating the lifetime warrantee?  JF
378801,bigugli,2009-09-01 13:52:00,6138,  You owe me a new screen
379002,Jonny,2009-09-02 03:15:00,1380," Thanks for a great idea, Cudz. It generated a lot of interest and amusing comment. I thought it would generate a lot more entries as people rose to the sporting challenge, but maybe it wasn't so easy to forsake good equipment even for a little while (I know for me it wasn't). Or maybe the timing just wasn't right for some reason.  I wouldn't be surprised if the Dollarama Derby is tried again next summer. I've had second thoughts about chucking out that awful reel; I think I might just store it away in case another opportunity comes up to use it."
379046,bigugli,2009-09-02 11:56:00,6138, It was fun. I'd certainly be up for another kick of the can.
379048,Fish Farmer,2009-09-02 12:17:00,2234,"I had more laughs at this Derby, Even my buds shook there heads at me. Best derby I fished all year. Thanks Cudz for a great idea and time  . Can't wait till the next one"
383813,chandru,2009-09-16 13:48:00,63,is this competetion only for bass??? i cought a 2 and half foot pike at mountsberg conservation area on a dollarama popper... i dont have the rod and reel in the shot though if i cannot be entered no problem but can i still post the pic? please pm me thankyou.
384444,Cudz,2009-09-18 02:24:00,2652,Hey Chandru The tourney is over for this year. You had to be using the whole dollarama kit including the rod and reel. Maybe next year.  Those poppers are good though.
385108,chandru,2009-09-20 08:29:00,63,i see cool thanks for the reply and yeh i've caught so many pike on those things! cheap and effective! dosen't get any better!

369377,throne7,2009-08-04 13:23:00,15,I am amazed that you caught anything with stuffs bought from a dollar store.  I guess that means I will stock up on dollar store lures from now on.
369457,TC1OZ,2009-08-04 16:54:00,987,I'm going to get started tonight  Who's down for organizing a Hamilton/Niagara Region g2g?
370989,Jonny,2009-08-09 20:52:00,1380,OK set to go.  Rod and reel - $4  Steel wire - $1.25  4 lures selected - $4 
370990,bigugli,2009-08-09 20:55:00,6138,"Nearby dollaramas don't have the pole, just the reel. Can I bodge one from natural materials, wire and duct tape( purchased at dollarama)?"
371112,Jonny,2009-08-10 02:40:00,1380,"OK, I have an entry --- such as it is! It was a calm evening on Nipissing so I figured I'd give it a try.  That $rama reel is a screamin' piece of crap - even for a small bass. The rod is OK, and the baits are pretty good --- for a buck.  Fish and lure photo...    Fish and tape photo...    That little bass coughed up three large shiners before got him in the boat. He must have liked the ""tinfoil"" lure.  Another fisherman out at dusk...  "
372195,Jonny,2009-08-13 01:30:00,1380,"Well, so far we've got 1st, 2nd and 3rd place sewn up, TJ!  I thought there would be a slew of entries by now, but it's off to a slow start."
372836,bigugli,2009-08-15 01:54:00,6138,"I searched high and low clear across Niagara looking for the Grail. been to 6 different stores.  Finally, after fending off bus loads of dollarama frenzied migrants who just got paid, I finally found a Dollerama bamboo pole. Here is the swag:  Here is the armoured version of the pole with a woven wrap of dollarama duct tape to compensate for certain weaknesses in the cane.   We now be ready, Aaargh!, to do battle with the mighty Leviathans of the deeps"
372911,Cudz,2009-08-15 18:26:00,2652,Still early boys.  Those are good entries but one pike will crush them.

373196,bigugli,2009-08-16 21:24:00,6138,Are you trying to tell us that Monique is gonna give us all a run for the glory?
375233,Fish Farmer,2009-08-22 12:37:00,2234,How long does this derby run? I haven't had a chance on using my stuff. The line is to short for trolling  . I've got to get some casting in.
375294,jaydub,2009-08-22 18:03:00,145, The derby's running for the whole month of August as far as I know.
375504,bassman87,2009-08-23 14:21:00,586,What happened to all the eager participants and all the people who started this derby. Did they all flop?
375744,Cudz,2009-08-24 02:56:00,2652,I am going out tomorrow.  And probably tues and sat.
375945,GBW,2009-08-24 20:39:00,8460,"work has gotten in the way for me...  that and my ""honey do list""..."

This is all the time I put in, got me 1 entrée.  Don't laugh, I even tried for an Erie Walleye. Theres only 50ft. of line on the reel. looks like about 20 LB. test. I had 5 ft. behind the ball 40ft down and only a couple raps on the reel. My buddy said this is going to be interesting. If I caught anything on that rod, LOOK OUT. May get out one more time before it's over. "
376344,MCTFisher9120,2009-08-25 16:44:00,3761, haha that's awesome dude!
