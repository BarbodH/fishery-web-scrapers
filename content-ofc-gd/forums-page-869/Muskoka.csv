327315,johnnyb,2009-04-07 01:42:00,3413,"According to the regs, lake trout is open from Jan. 1st to Sept. 30th, but you should check for exceptions on lakes you plan to fish.  I think that your biggest problem is going to be finding water to fish safely...from what I've read/heard, the ice is pretty much shot, but I don't think it's ready for boating yet.  Good time to scout out those backlakes you've always wanted to find, and plug in a route on your GPS"
327378,fishboy,2009-04-07 03:31:00,550,  I think johnnyb is right...you're in that dreaded week or so of no good ice and not enough open water
