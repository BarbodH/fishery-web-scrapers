327484,BUSTER,2009-04-07 14:51:00,1336,"well iam not selling my extra 4 tickets now untill i know who's opening,i heard alice in chains?  just a rumor tho as of now some said maryln manson others say mastrodom? so who knows..  i check metallica forum often waiting for confirmation, loads of guessing out there"
327522,Paulus,2009-04-07 16:27:00,522,"1) Orion 2) For Whom the Bell Tolls 3) The Day that Never Comes  I saw them first in 86 or 87, during the Master of Puppets tour. When they did ""An Evening with Metallica"" to follow up the Black album (which is a hilarious reference to Spinal Tap, btw) it was a double show. During the first show, they played Orion - which I'd never heard them play live til then - so I went out and bought a ticket for the second show just to see them play it again.  I agree with the person who posted that the latest album is good. Let's say it doesn't suck as badly as Load and ... was it ""Re Load""? I've been listening to The Day that Never Comes basically non-stop for a couple of months now... still not tired of the guitar work in that tune (i.e. full version, not solo-less, de-cojonified radio version). I think it made me feel.... young again.  p.-"

326375,Handlebarz,2009-04-05 00:18:00,3790,harvester  of Sorrow is one hell of a tune. As for favorite that is a hard question to answer there are just to many of them from Justice back. I do like the Black album. Jump in the fire brings back some great memories I know Buster will remember alot of these days gone by.  I wish I had known that they were on sale today I would have had the wife try for us that sucks to miss out Oh well I will most likley be out on the boat that day
326376,BUSTER,2009-04-05 00:22:00,1336,"oh boy , mike  no stories on jump in the fire and pit parties!!!"

326444,SBCregal,2009-04-05 03:00:00,688,"one is right up there on my favourites list... like many have said, anything up to and including the black album is great...after that, meh.  they seemed to lose a bit of edge around then....  lost edge?  i WILL be going to the show in october...gonna have to get scalped seats, i missed them with guns and roses and im still kicking myself.  ryan"
326464,Fishnwire,2009-04-05 03:54:00,983,EVERYTHING up to and including Justice is just so freakin`metal!!!!!!!!  The stuff from the Black album on is really good...they`re still one of the world`s greatest bands putting out amazing music...but the first four (studio) albums are so much better it`s like comparing two different bands.  Seek and Destroy is just about as good as it gets.
326466,Joeytier,2009-04-05 04:04:00,3990,"I'd like to see them live, but I can't justify paying big money to see a group of musicians that haven't created music for any reason other than fattening their wallets for almost 20 years now.  Not to mention James' vocals are completely done now, and him, along with Kirk's horrendous guitar tone, would completely butcher the classic songs.  Oh, and Ride The Lightning is probably my favourite."
326473,Angler16,2009-04-05 04:43:00,188,everyone has a different opinion..
326518,anders,2009-04-05 13:38:00,1168,I am so jealous to those that got tickets...i tried to get 2 to the Monday show but to no avail.  If anyone bought tickets to sell again..let me know!!!!!!!  One and Whiskey in the jar are my faves....pretty big fan of Cyanide too.
326561,nancur373,2009-04-05 15:26:00,1211,One would have to be my fav. James really needs to start drinking again.
326611,holdfast,2009-04-05 17:55:00,1813,Enter the Sandman.  Used to play that song in the Dressing Room before going out on the ice for our Broom ball Games in the Military.  Good incentive music to get the team in a Rough and tumble mood.  Got to say number two is KING NOTHING  But the more I hear the new on CYANIDE the more I'm liking it as top two.
