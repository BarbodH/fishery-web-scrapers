326694,Radnine,2009-04-05 21:23:00,1538,Great shots. I hope you were working inside. Thanks for sharing. Jim
326795,Pigeontroller,2009-04-06 01:06:00,2793,53 stories? I thought is was 58?  I worked across the street at that other big building with the onion on the top!...Which doesn't seem so big now...  Cool pics!
326865,RuNnYoOzE,2009-04-06 02:24:00,270,that building is huge!
326920,pikehunter,2009-04-06 10:50:00,1659,Thanks for posting some great shots of Lake Erie's ass. We had a free room for one night at the Fallsview several years ago. The view was similiar to that...that is it would have been if we hadn't been fogged in for 2 days!
326932,lunkerbasshunter,2009-04-06 12:05:00,2585,"greta pics, sure is a different world from up there!  Cheers!"
326956,bigfish1965,2009-04-06 13:22:00,3382,Nice pics! What is the structure they are  building behind it? Parking garage??
326958,bigfish1965,2009-04-06 13:23:00,3382, From the side it doesn't look like an onion!! lmao....
327035,Steve,2009-04-06 16:26:00,2075,- dont fall.  I underwrote the Insurance for that project.
327040,ch312,2009-04-06 16:38:00,1590, yes its a parking garage. if i were still with my previous employer id be working on it   when i tell people im one of those guys that hangs off the side of a building 30 stories up they think im nuts or have a death wish. if they only knew how nice it is having an awesome view almost every day. plus there is nobody to bug you up there...  hopefully whoever built the new hilton did a bad job on the exterior to give me a chance to do some restoration on it in the future
327069,Steve,2009-04-06 17:32:00,2075,"ummm, lets not hope that.  (as we will be the ones paying for it)  I love this stuff.  Putting a price to Insure it is an amazing process, as are the ongoing inspections as the project progresses.  We also did the Absolute Towers in Mississauga - the rotating towers.  But as the highrise market dwindles, we are focusing more towards infrastructure work - cause the govn't is throwing so much money at it!"
327169,Rich Clemens,2009-04-06 21:21:00,3131,Really net pics Steamerguy ... that would be one heck of a cast from there.
327205,Streamerguy,2009-04-06 21:56:00,121," It was suppose to be 58,city only allowed them 53   Yes like ch312 said..except the part behind the Renessance is an addition.Don't understand how they can build these huge buildings with no tourist to fill them.Niagara falls usually has so many people walking around this time of year but the streets are empty right now.   Not worried about falling but those out door lifts(elevators)I don't trust   LOL ...I Thought about that many days looking down there,that big rock at the bottom of the american falls looks like the perfect drift.  Glad you all enjoyed it,cheers Streamerguy"
327357,Leecher,2009-04-07 03:01:00,7832,Thanks for sharing the view of the presidential suites with us.... Awesome
327377,fishboy,2009-04-07 03:29:00,550,sweet view-thanks for sharing
327444,Troit,2009-04-07 12:53:00,19,"nice pics there 20, i new the view was nice but that sunrise wow"
327694,Baptiste,2009-04-07 23:14:00,37,"Great shots. My family and I spent a night at the Marriott before crossing over to catch a flight to Florida a few weeks ago. The weather was great and my kids loved the whole Niagara Falls experience. As for the 3k a night Hilton suite, for that money you could spend the night in the Paris Hilton but I hear it's a bit dirty."
