326810,darsky,2009-04-06 01:23:00,586,"I am on the fence about this purchase. Eagle 640c is a bit cheaper. Also has the edge on pixels-640 x 480. Has a screen that is not quite 5 inches. Lowrance 522 has 480 x 480 and the screen is a TRUE 5"" . Also Lowrance has 2400w vs 1500. Input?"
326857,grt1,2009-04-06 02:03:00,638,"I got a 640c last year and really like it. the price was the factor for me, why pay more for the lowrance name when you getthe samereadings with a cheaper unit. as far as the wattage, I guess it depends on how deep the water you fish is. In my case the deepest is 50 feet so the power isn't a real factor."
326863,Radnine,2009-04-06 02:12:00,1538,"You know that they are made by the same company, right? That may sound like a dopey question, but you need to know that you are getting Lowrance quality (or lack of, depending on your take) in both products. I was not aware until I saw them together at the fishing show and  said ""hey, wait a tick..."" Remember, I'm gifted. Jim"
326922,Billy Bob,2009-04-06 11:13:00,5865,The more powerful Lowrance make a lot of sense if you will be fishing the Great Lakes or any other deep lake. Also the Lowrance 522 can be networked together while the Eagle cannot. There are also some other smaller features on the Lowrance that you might not be aware of if you purchase the Eagle but will enjoy if you get the Lowrance. I have always been a Lowrance fan. ALL the Pro's have Lowrance as do ALL tournament anglers. But that's not saying there is anything wrong by saving a few dollars on the Eagle brand. It just has less bells and whistles than the it's bigger brother.
326984,scugpg,2009-04-06 14:25:00,1373,lots of great deals on the 522 right now!
327073,Uncle Buck,2009-04-06 17:41:00,1000,"then go to a humminbird at 5"" with 640x640 res and 4000W... and cheaper...  personal preference is what it comes down to..."
327092,ecmilley,2009-04-06 18:18:00,2163,"generally the lowrance is made with highr quality internals, i would pick the lowrance over the eagle hands down"
327356,darsky,2009-04-07 02:56:00,586,really-where abouts ??
327379,fishboy,2009-04-07 03:32:00,550,the good news is they're both quality products
327841,scugpg,2009-04-08 12:11:00,1373, Radioworld $599 http://radioworld.ca/product_info.php?cPat...roducts_id=3051  ...also check Angling Outfitters in Woodstock as well Jocelyn might be able to put together a 522 & chip package for you
327960,Kerry,2009-04-08 20:59:00,383,If you are really interested in a product from Eagle/Lowrance or Humminbird you might find going to the companies websites and checking up on their Legacy lines (ie discontinued) might be of interest before purchasing a unit.Especially if it's a combined graph/gps plotter.
