326285,tinbanger,2009-04-04 19:21:00,1028,"Those stong east winds pushed that ice off the west side , but sure made a mess on the east side.    My sister in law sent these pics over this morning of the damge done to my inlaws ( cottage next door) water front. May not be as bad as it looks .  happens about every 7-10 years , the joy of water front living .  TB"
326286,Terry,2009-04-04 19:24:00,14456,I bet now the south shore is getting hammered
326320,pikeie,2009-04-04 20:55:00,380,WOW! Deja vu! i remember when that happend to their cottage when i was 8 or 9. hope you guys can fix it soon enough!!
326321,tinbanger,2009-04-04 20:56:00,1028,maybe we'll wait till you are home from school! our House needs a roof too  Dad
326554,fishboy,2009-04-05 15:05:00,550,ouch..hope the work needed doesn't steal too much fishing time
326565,tinbanger,2009-04-05 15:40:00,1028,"  Not to bad , pike are close by  TB"
326639,lookinforwalleye,2009-04-05 18:49:00,4399,Would a home owners policy pay for that?
326641,irishfield,2009-04-05 18:51:00,26272,"Even my cottage insurance won't cover a ""wet"" boat house.. so I doubt it... unless of course it's just a patio.. and not a dock."
326714,fishinfool,2009-04-05 22:23:00,366,"Every two or three years we have that problem at the cottage on Balsam, just depends on which way the wind blows. The good thing about it is we are kinda hoping to take possession of our neighbors dock which he just built two seasons ago when it ends up on our shoreline. LOL I will likely be building an aluminum dock system in the next little while which can be winched up on a pivot pin at the shore for the winter months to avoid this bi annual headache."
326767,Dara,2009-04-06 00:08:00,3052,"  Umm,,how is spring breakup a ""semi-annual"" event"
326769,fishinfool,2009-04-06 00:11:00,366, Read the first line of my post and try and stay with us Dara.

327080,douG,2009-04-06 17:55:00,2693,I think that 'semiannual' means twice a year.  I do not think it means what you think it means.
327083,Roy,2009-04-06 18:06:00,13728,"It's the word filter. When we type ""BI"" it shows as ""SEMI"""
327144,fishinfool,2009-04-06 20:43:00,366,Ha fixed it! You guys need to go fishing real bad!!!
327218,Rizzo,2009-04-06 22:23:00,4754,so that's where all our ice went. Hope its not as bad as it looks
327426,tinbanger,2009-04-07 11:40:00,1028," Often it settles back down and only requires a few hours of work. For 40 plus years it was piles driven in by hand ( cedar post) backed up by railway ties   . You only had to replace the odd piling every year . When my father in law bought the place in the 60's he 'reclaimed' about 20' of the waterfront ,stuff you can't do now ( thankfully) Ice took that out about 10 or so years ago . its now rip rap with the PT 6x6 in the photo just to hold back the sod.  If it was my call I would opt for a more natural water front and let the ice have its way .  TB"
