327745,BassAsin,2009-04-08 01:55:00,806,went for a walk today with my buddy rob (stylincatch) lookin for some antler sheds. didnt find a one but got a few cool pics.  the first is an uprooted poplar tree where a brick yard existed years and years ago. (pretty obvious)  second is near a small spring that sprays into the air  and lastly is a few deer kinda shaky and blurry at about 80 yards just a few of the 30 we saw   all within 100 acres and surrounded by city in one way or another  Matt!

Ive had a dry spell the last couple weeks, only finding a few here and there, but ive managed to find 50 sheds so far this season.  keep your eyes on the ground mike"

Matt!"
