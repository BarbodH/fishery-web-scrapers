327698,purekgw,2009-04-07 23:28:00,585,just use a big bait holder with egg sinkers and you will know when they want it if ur not holding your rod u might lose it they usually run with it
327709,aplumma,2009-04-07 23:53:00,6896,I found that if you want to catch more cats you should switch to circle hooks. The important thing to remember is not to set the hook but to sweep the rod with a slow steady pull. I have found that when using bait and a circle hook that the cats will mostly pick up the bait and move away with the bait in their mouth. As they leave they are crushing the bait to kill it and as the line tightens it pulls the hook up into the corner of the mouth. You will find it is an easy release and more hook-ups just remember if you set a circle hook you will pop it out of their mouths. If you are going for channel cats use a fresh bait either chicken livers or cut bait. The smaller fish will go for the stink baits but as they get bigger they are used to eating fish they are meat eaters and a 10 lb fish will eat a bait that is 4 inches with ease. I use shad here for the big Blue cats and use baits up to 10 inches for the 40-50 lb fish....   Art

327889,ohhenrygsr,2009-04-08 15:18:00,947,"I usually use a 3-way swivle. I leave about 8-12"" leader between the hook to the swivle and the same distance between the sinker and the swivle. I usually either use liver or shrimp, just toss it out and grab a stick where you can peg it to the ground and rest the rod on it. Some guys like to use a bell I usually just tie a small ribbon or something bright to the end of your rod so you can see the strikes."
