If your comming up this way, i recommend bringing your boat and anchoring off the mouth of the river are casting or roe bagging for bows.  The whitefish are now comming in real strong of the mouth of the notty, so bring some light action gear and try for some whities if the bows arnt hitting.  Every river along the south shore of geogian bay is completely mudded out, hope this helps  cheers mike"
