327207,siwash,2009-04-06 21:59:00,683,  I agree.. the wolves help keep it all in balance..  how ome i hear some hunters complain that there are fewer dear the days?!!
327210,richyb,2009-04-06 22:02:00,774,  Because they arent very good hunters and spook the deer before they get the chance to see them. OR they go to the stand and fall asleep and miss all of the deer that walk by lol
327216,misfish,2009-04-06 22:19:00,29133, You met my pop?????????LOL
327217,RuNnYoOzE,2009-04-06 22:22:00,270,"   wolves are opportunist hunters ,,they usually only hunt weak or sick animals...The movie "" never cry wolf "" there main stable is rodents!"
327224,steverowbotham,2009-04-06 22:30:00,1800,"I had 4 run out in front of my truck a few days back just east of Lindsay, almost popped the last one."
327228,Bigworm,2009-04-06 22:40:00,119,"I have had that same picture e-mailed to me and it states that the picture was taken in Nova Scotia, not in the Kawarthas. However, I've seen almost as many up there as well.  Mark"
327232,Roy,2009-04-06 22:46:00,13728," The Ojibwa word for poor hunter is ""vegetarian""."
327240,RuNnYoOzE,2009-04-06 23:00:00,270,"I knew a farmer who said it was legal to shoot deer out of season if they walked on your property? Can you imagine all those families who go without , the deer population is out of control ..how many mouths could be fed!  but then you got some guy on a deer farm selling it!  I don't want to sound like a hippie but seriously the whole province of Ontario could supplement their diet on all the deer running loose! I heard it was in the millions!"
327246,Terry,2009-04-06 23:06:00,14456,I just got this emailed to me it's all the deer showing up in keswick skidoo trails this winter           LOL
327264,misfish,2009-04-06 23:33:00,29133,My pop would still miss.LOL Sorry pop.LOL
327278,Leecher,2009-04-07 00:05:00,7832,  Terry.... Now that's photoshopped  LOL Great job on doubling the herd LOL  TJ sure is amazing to see that many on a skidoo trail!!!!  Thanks for sharing Leechman
327319,Radnine,2009-04-07 01:45:00,1538,Nevermind! Jim
327323,RuNnYoOzE,2009-04-07 01:50:00,270,if you look close enough you will see some bad cropping on the deer on the right! I don't think deer have edged backs and white stuff on their bellies. all the rest were done pretty well!
327324,Terry,2009-04-07 01:56:00,14456,"if you are talking about mine, it took me all of 30 seconds to do I never tried to be good, it was a joke, because some said he was sent the picture and they said the picture was taken somewhere else so I thought I would do the same   good was never important"
327326,TJQ,2009-04-07 02:03:00,7806,"LOL... alll I know is that picture make smy tummy grummble...  I just though it was cooll  Im leaving at 6 am...  if theres any internet where im going, lol..  ill be sure taunt ALL OF YOU..."
327338,ozaibak1,2009-04-07 02:20:00,401,"Absolutely beautiful. I like the Kawarthas since they are a great balance of proximity to Toronto, excellent fishing, and excellent citizens. One of my key goals in life is to have at least one cottage on the Kawarthas w/ all the trimmings (wife, kids, boat). My favorite lake is Stoney Lake. That picture is absolutely awesome, thanks for posting TJ!"
327339,irishfield,2009-04-07 02:22:00,26272, Just remember what pay backs are.......  ..and I can get to your beer!
327396,Stern Rules,2009-04-07 04:35:00,342,I saw that pic last year and it said it was in New Brunswick so who knows. Same with the albino moose pics and that one said New Brunswick too.
327411,RuNnYoOzE,2009-04-07 08:28:00,270,   LOL AS a hunter I would send a shot in the air to scatter them..I just don't see any sport in shooting into such a huge herd and oooh knowing how skittish deer are most would have scattered as soon as they got the photographers scent!
326935,TJQ,2009-04-06 12:22:00,7806,Umm....  ummm....     I dont know what to say... this was taken very recently on a Kawartha lakes skidoo trail.  LOL...  
326940,Skud,2009-04-06 12:34:00,739,"Not recently, there hasn't been that much snow there for over a month. And why are they not afraid of the people at both ends of the crowd? I don't think it is the Kawartha's. Maybe Manitoulin or Restoule. North west of Ottawa has crazy numbers of deer also.  And why aren't you in Cuba?"
326941,TJQ,2009-04-06 12:37:00,7806,HMMF... lol.. ok  fairly recently???  Its from the Kawarthas snowmobile club... anyway... leaving for Cuba Tomorrow!!!
326945,FLEX ROD,2009-04-06 12:44:00,394,"Great picture TJ, thanks for sharing.  I don't know, is that a reflection of what the Deer population is like in the Kawarthas? If it is, then that shows that maybe the regs need to be adjusted by the MNR? If the deer population is that badly out of whack then what is the over all situation like? I live in Vaughan and I know that the heard behind my house is multipling big time. As a NON HUNTER I think that the season has to be looked at and the tag draws and controlled hunts also have to be re-evaluated.  FLEX"
326950,TJQ,2009-04-06 13:03:00,7806, Ill go!! ill go!!!
326954,trapshooter,2009-04-06 13:18:00,1234,Was there a lot of snow up that way this winter?  They must have been enjoying the easy travel on the trail.  Cool pic though TJ.  Thanks for sharing.
326971,Zubris21,2009-04-06 13:45:00,563,"wow, that is unreal!  thanks for sharing!"
326972,irishfield,2009-04-06 13:47:00,26272,Time to thin them out... they got that thick in oro/medonte a couple decades back and they were so interbreeded they had some serious defects...
326987,chukkk,2009-04-06 14:38:00,57,photo shopped  in my opion
326989,kemper,2009-04-06 14:42:00,2232,photoshopped  there is like 6 or 7 deer in different positions and they are repeated look closely
326992,Beans,2009-04-06 14:52:00,3339,We had anywhere from 3 to 4 feet of snow on our front and back yards most of the winter...  The most deer we had walk accross was 12...mostly 2 or three...nice to watch!
326996,BillM,2009-04-06 15:10:00,17367,"Kemper, that's not a chop.."
326998,richyb,2009-04-06 15:23:00,774,Deer yard up for the winter. Looks like they are being fed at that location. That is likely every deer for a 3 mile range that have yarded up there. My buddy had 17 deer in his backyard everynight over the winter.. Cool pic.
327008,misfish,2009-04-06 15:45:00,29133,Not chopped. Pops yard looked like that all winter.
327022,Bernie,2009-04-06 16:03:00,3190,"That picture is something like our bi-monthly Pike from Europe. Seen it last winter, supposedly from Wisconsin. Who knows?"
327024,Skud,2009-04-06 16:06:00,739,"Misfish,  That many deer at your dads and you still didn't get one. tsk,tsk"
327036,buckster,2009-04-06 16:26:00,530,I dont care where this was taking i just wish it was under one of my stands!
327038,Bernie,2009-04-06 16:31:00,3190,Take a drive any direction around up here in the evening this time of year and count a hundred in four or five KM.
327061,BassAsin,2009-04-06 17:14:00,806,"port loring yard sure is amazing, aint it!!"
327125,misfish,2009-04-06 20:00:00,29133, My mudder tells them when were coming and they all hit the high road.LOL
327128,siwash,2009-04-06 20:04:00,683,Where r the wolves?
327140,Cookslav,2009-04-06 20:28:00,1457,I've seen a crowd similar but not to that extent. I live on the edge of town here and when the snow is on the ground....the Farm feild next my place is FULL of them around 8pm religously. They eat the left over Corn stalks just beneith the Snow. On occasion My Wife and I have been able to count 18 of them. The Problem here is its Technically in the City limits...no shoot'n allowed. The Turkey population is crazy as well but its a bloody Sancutary out here LOL!
327150,misfish,2009-04-06 20:52:00,29133," Pop has two wolves on his property.They have taken 2 deer this year from the herd. Ones a black and the other a blond colour.  It,s natures way."
327152,smokin joe,2009-04-06 20:56:00,226,Hey Wayne just put a couple of gun mounts on the side of your plane   You'll make a fortune
327178,DRIFTER_016,2009-04-06 21:31:00,10439,"When I lived in Grand Valley we had as many as 2 dozen in the field next door. Up at my buddies cabin in Kenora the deer are as thick as weeds as well. Manitoulin has stupid #'s of deer too. On one trip from Espanola to the Ferry I counted over 50. It was the worst white knuckle drive of my life!!!! It was after dark and the things were everywhere. I had deer crossing in front of me, standing and running in the ditches and running along the shoulder of the road looking at me. There were a number of nice bucks too. I don't think I drove faster than 45 or 50 K."
