Would it be just like the police and they would have an auction ? or is there some warehouse jam packed with all sorts of outdoor gear ?"
326615,purekgw,2009-04-05 18:06:00,585,i have always wondered that to i would think they would have an auction to clear the stuff out
326617,irishfield,2009-04-05 18:08:00,26272,Held until your court date comes up or you pay the fines. Sometimes given back.. other times for public auction.
326629,Fishnwire,2009-04-05 18:30:00,983,I'm fairly certain Irishfield is right.  If you go to court and just a fine is imposed (and paid) you generally get your stuff back.  Don't poach and you've got no worries.
326674,Handlebarz,2009-04-05 20:26:00,3790,This is one of the biggest JOKES around (NOT THE MNR GUYS AND GIRLS BUT THE LAW THEY HAVE TO DEAL WITH)  as they take your stuff lets say a person get's caught to many rods they take the extra rods this person pays a fine of $150 or so then they get the stuff back that's not bad for the ones who are running 4 or 6 extra rods heck only paying $150 to get the stuff back is cheap.  The part that really sucks is that there is no record of it so this same person can go out and do it all over again and again and again and only pay the fine and get there stuff back unlike when you get a speeding ticket or seat belt one you loose your right to drive with to many violations maybe if they were able to keep track of this info and start to keep the tackle and auction it off or donate it to good will or some kids club for them to use this would make some think before they go out and do the things they do.
326813,moose,2009-04-06 01:26:00,266,i know the barrie district of anglers and hunters had a action a couple of yrs ago with stuff the mnr had taken
327105,Stoty,2009-04-06 18:53:00,2910,I bet half the people keep the stuff for themselves!
327107,hammercarp,2009-04-06 19:03:00,964,They take your stuff as evidence in the comission of the offence. If you are transporting over your limit in your boat it can be seized as evidence. They can't just seize stuff willy nilly.
327108,Guest gbfisher,2009-04-06 19:07:00,0,Just ask the Midland OPP that carry the MNR with them.  They keep it.   They can do what they want...
327111,2 tone z71,2009-04-06 19:23:00,1311,id snap the rods in half and see if they could swim before anyone took anything
327177,outllaw,2009-04-06 21:30:00,1232,"normally what happens in southern ont. the fines issued or a summons to appear in court. if the subject pleas or is found guilty, the equipment is returned.innocent the same results. the persons then go to the mnr detachment and gets their stuff returned.. after all fines are payed.."
327203,PAZE,2009-04-06 21:54:00,132,"As said they normaly give it back, they use to have public auctions but they stopped them as far as I know, so who knows what happens to the stuff now, to be honest they can do whatever they want with it, the people that lost them deserved it anyway they where breaking the law.  Paul"
