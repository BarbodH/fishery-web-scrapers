327883,Fang,2009-04-08 14:58:00,1330,I've seen these 3 guys fish. There would have been nothing to report anyways.  Glad you got the roof done malcolm. Shame you didn't get Rick back up to clear the trail into my new moose stand though. Looks like it'll be you and me in that new spot unless Rick sells it out to the guys in the first week.
