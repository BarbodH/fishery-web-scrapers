327463,danc,2009-04-07 14:03:00,4677,STORY  Can you believe this??
327465,Joey,2009-04-07 14:09:00,9122,"Wow Dan, that's a little close to home eh, sheesh.  Joey"
327466,irishfield,2009-04-07 14:09:00,26272,"You know what they say about leaving the keys in your car... .. Same deal ! Flight school owner admits she leaves the keys in all the airplanes, not that you really need them anyhow.. but sure makes it easy to walk on the ramp and fly away.  Problem is.. this is just what homeland security needed to gain support for the security nonsense they are trying to push thru in General Aviation south of the border. Pretty soon GA will be dead."
327467,kickingfrog,2009-04-07 14:10:00,8333,Read about that. My first thought was were was Irishfield?
327470,danc,2009-04-07 14:15:00,4677,I hear ya Wayne. Not a good story for private airplane owners.  Here's a link from CNN's Anderson Cooper show. This was a serious situation. Click HERE
327474,Gerritt,2009-04-07 14:24:00,6129,Looks like we have his motive.....  http://cnews.canoe.ca/CNEWS/Canada/2009/04...9037356-ap.html   G
327476,tinbanger,2009-04-07 14:35:00,1028,  I thought he had read Moosebunks report and was looking for some good pike spots LOL  TB
327497,Beats,2009-04-07 15:15:00,543,That's quite the plan that guy had..
327499,danc,2009-04-07 15:21:00,4677, Geez. Waynes landing on Lake Nipigon was more of a suicide attempt than that. What a wuss...
327532,irishfield,2009-04-07 16:40:00,26272,"  Yah got that right Dan!!!  Here's the real issue though......!  ""This has been a test.................This was a test of the terrorist delivery network...........................Had this been an actual attack, our brother would have been able to delivery a WMD to your town. We thank you infidels for showing us that you do not have the '####' to shoot down a threatening plane. We will keep that in mind when we plan our next attack , err We mean our next ""man made catostrphe."""
327538,2 tone z71,2009-04-07 16:51:00,1311,oh how true
327552,hammercarp,2009-04-07 17:29:00,964,Wanna bet some poor guy is going to get shot down as a result of this.
327554,irishfield,2009-04-07 17:34:00,26272,"Hammer carp... HE should have been shot down.    There are so many rules these days to fly a GA aircraft across the border that they only had one choice... and they failed to take it. This is going to have a HUGE impact on General Aviation that is already going into the dumpster in the USA and getting worse here in Canada. How would you like to call in before starting your car... get a trip plan and transponder code to squack so they can track your trip from your laneway to Bass Pro...oh and don't leave without your new fangled security card or you can't walk from the BPS doors to your car before departure. That about sums up what it takes to fly around the ""patch"" in your old J3Cub state side these days."
327555,danc,2009-04-07 17:37:00,4677, Scary stuff Wayne. The pilot was a recent Turkish immigrant I think and a new member of the Canadian society.
327556,irishfield,2009-04-07 17:39:00,26272,I should have pointed out that that quote was taken from another news site...
327558,Cookslav,2009-04-07 17:47:00,1457," Absolutely... If it were my call, he would have had until he was 10km off the coast. If he didn't respond by then it would have been over.  The fact he saw them, and didn't make contact or answer should have constituted action. To play Devils Advocate... His Radio could have been off or not functioning, but when they made visual contact, and he didn't react I would have added the equasion. Stolen Plane + on course for the States + radio Silence + Ignoring Visual contact = Potential for BIG trouble, lets bring him down.  I'm surprised they let him fly by, or near populated areas?"
327561,POLLIWOGG,2009-04-07 18:03:00,835,"I would think they did a great job of assessing the risk from this guy, far better than our mounties, and I'm sure he was a half second from getting blown away for most of the trip.  Truth is you don't need a plane to deliver a wmd anyone can get their hands on a  wmd in a couple hours and deliver it in a couple more and be home in time for wheel of fortune the trick is not to make them want to."
327564,Guest gbfisher,2009-04-07 18:13:00,0,If suddenly you find you are being escorted by fighters......it's time to land!  same mistakes all over again. Shoulda blasted it out of the sky!
327575,xeon,2009-04-07 18:42:00,350,"My friends and friends of friends actually know the guy (theyre aviation students at Confed in Tbay and Sault College).  At the time we all had a pool going what he was going to do: Run, Stay, Suicide, or Enjoy the wrath of a Sidewinder. I lost 5 bucks, but technically I should have won according to his claimed motive."
327589,lunkerbasshunter,2009-04-07 19:10:00,2585,i would have shot him down.  period!
327614,Maverick,2009-04-07 19:58:00,371,"Send him to Guantanamo Bay and let them use their ""enhanced interrogation techniques"" on him."
327668,holdfast,2009-04-07 22:22:00,1813,"All I got to say is another embarrassment to this Country thanks to our so called new Canadians.  I think the Yanks should send the plane back, Escort the so Called Canadian back to Turkey, and then bill him.  But that wont happen, someone in Ottawa will cry ( Non Conservatives) that they want our new Canadian out of jail and back to Canada.  Wish I had the controls, because I would of made sure Mr. Dumbass would only land back to earth as Pink Mist.  I suppose this will get locked up because I said something wrong over your way."
327675,Maverick,2009-04-07 22:35:00,371, That's what usually happens . Now keep your opinions to a minimum!
327686,Roy,2009-04-07 22:52:00,13728,"Yes holdie, this will get locked but don't go snappin' your suspenders just yet. Your words had nothing to do with the key getting shoved in the lock. Yes this is a scary scenario but our neighbours handled it like the professionals that they are.  I don't think that this thread will give us (as a fishing board) much more than a chance to dislike each other for the things that we've said. So, for that let's all take a deep breath, get yourself a beverage and then go read/re-read Moosebunk's report."
