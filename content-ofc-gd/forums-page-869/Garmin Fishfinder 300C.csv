327236,Lunker777,2009-04-06 22:57:00,866,Hey everyone....  I'm in the market for a fish finder for my little 12' aluminum. I want to be able to transfer it to a bigger boat if I get one... like a 14-16'.  I budgeted $200-300 for it... so the Garmin 300C caught my eye. Im just curious who has experience with this unit and what people have to say about them !  Thanks
