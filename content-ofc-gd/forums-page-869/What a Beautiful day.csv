327015,ohhenrygsr,2009-04-06 15:54:00,947,"Orillia - Lagoon City - Washago 10:29 AM EDT Monday 6 April 2009 Snowfall warning for Orillia - Lagoon City - Washago continued  Heavy snowfall today.    A significant low pressure area currently tracking across Lake Erie will pass along the lower lakes today. Wet snow associated with the low has enveloped the extreme southwest through the Dundalk Highlands into southern Georgian Bay. It will continue throughout much of the day for many regions. General snowfall amounts up to 15 centimetres are forecast by tonight.  The snow will taper off to a few flurries tonight with the exception being areas to the south-southeast of Lake Huron and Georgian Bay where flurries and localized snowsqualls are expected. Several more centimetres of snow are likely in some of these areas. A snow squall warning is not out of the question for some snow belt locales, but seems somewhat unlikely as the squalls are not expected to be particularly intense.  Some blowing snow is also expected in many regions - mainly tonight as the mercury dips below the freezing mark.  Travel may be difficult due to accumulating snow and some blowing and drifting.

327127,glen,2009-04-06 20:02:00,2641,Thanks Henry.  I was wondering who was doing the filming for Casey and Jennifer.  Your good with a camera.
327129,richyb,2009-04-06 20:05:00,774,"  Coldwater to orillia is only a 80k limit anyways. whats wrong with driving 60k if the roads are crap? My g/f used to drive like you ( i have to do the speed limit, screw the conditions) untill she wrote off her car on the 400. Better to be safe than sorry."
327274,irishfield,2009-04-06 23:59:00,26272,"I pulled 9"" of snow off my boat cover at 4 PM and it's still coming down. Did manage to get the hangar rotated... after putting the plow back on the truck and plowing the darn snow.."
