327296,kemper,2009-04-07 00:59:00,2232,I would head for crappies too.  It rained all morning in Oshawa... on and off and then pretty hard rain for 2 hours in the afternoon and started snowing around 7 I heard. I was back on my way to Guelph and all the rivers on the way out were toast. Credit looked like small barns might start flowing past at any time.  Gotta write an exam but I will be spending some time on the water next week wednesday till sunday so maybe ill see ya out there
