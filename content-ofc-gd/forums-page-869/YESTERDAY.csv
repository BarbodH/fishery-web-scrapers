WAS GLAD TO SEE ONLY HALF THE GTA OUT TODAY ON MY LITTLE CREEK LOL CAUGHT A FEW SMALL ONES AND THIS NICE HEN. LOST ANOTHER MONSTER IN THE WOOD. WAS LIKE BASS FISHIN FOR STEEL. ALL FISH WERE HUGGIN THE WOOD. WAS NICE TO RUN INTO SILVIO AND SHARE A FEW STORIES. RIVERS BLOWN TODAY BUT THERES ALWAYS TOMOR  LOL

327359,douG,2009-04-07 03:07:00,2693,CC wants a cold night?  I think he gets his wish in spades.  I saw two BIG SUVs into the QEW guardrail near Jameson tonight around 10 pm.  Water Resource Management folks at the MNR (me bruvvah) are hoping for cold temps too.
