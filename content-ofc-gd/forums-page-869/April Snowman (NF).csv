327119,Cudz,2009-04-06 19:37:00,2652,As if I am building snowmen in April.  Only took a few minutes.  Some really heavy snow and it is still coming down.  This is the first time I can remember a snow day in April.  All the houses in my neighbourhood are sporting snowmen. Pic of me with my two older daughters.  My youngest was napping and missed out on all the fun but she is outside playing in the white stuff now.
