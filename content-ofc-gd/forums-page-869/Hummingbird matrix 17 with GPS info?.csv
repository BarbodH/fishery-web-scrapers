327475,Mr Twister,2009-04-07 14:30:00,71,I just picked up a used Matrix 17 and has a GPS hooked up with it but no buttons on the face of the unit has way points and such? I printed out the maual for the Matrix but mentions nothing about the GPS functions with this unit???  Any help would be great!  Thanks
327503,cranks bait,2009-04-07 15:33:00,721,I have the Matrix 97.  Not too sure what you are asking here.  All you have to do is plug the GPS puck into the unit.  It will set itself and all that jazz.  As for marking way points and stuff there should be buttons for that or use the menu button?
327527,bassjnkie,2009-04-07 16:35:00,1101,"I have the same one, you have to by the receiver puck.  Here's a link http://www.basspro.com/webapp/wcs/stores/s...__SearchResults  If you have the puck, then just plug it in and it will recognize it. BTW doesn't work indoors."

327585,Maverick,2009-04-07 19:07:00,371,Yeah I have the same unit too but I haven't used it yet. I might be pming you this summer UB if that's alright but I'm usually pretty good with elec's so we'll see.
327642,Uncle Buck,2009-04-07 21:10:00,1000,"no worries, PM away... LOL"
327693,boatman,2009-04-07 23:13:00,350,"I bought one of these very units from Uncle Buck last year. I don't have the GPS puck as I use a handheld GPS. However, the unit itself is great and UB was very helpful. I think he's owned most of the Matrix line."
327973,steelhedrmatt,2009-04-08 21:40:00,278,"Good unit!!  Just press menu while in GPS mode, and an option screen will appear.  First option is MARK.  Press arrow right and you have marked your waypoint"
