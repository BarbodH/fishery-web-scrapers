I've only ever fished for bass, walleye and pike so I am doing some research to see what I need to take on trout in Lake Ontario.  I'm hoping the group here can give me a head start on my research and provide me some recommendations (that won't break the bank) on rods, reels, lures and tactics that would help me in this new pursuit.  I live in Orleans (suburb of Ottawa) so I will begin my search of trout out of the Kingston/Belleville area.  I've never fished Lake Ontario so if someone knows of a good boat launch area, that would be greatly appreciated as well.  Thanks for your help."
