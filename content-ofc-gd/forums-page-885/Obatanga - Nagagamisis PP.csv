Might make a trip to Nagagamisis. Any good fishing to be had there? Am only really looking for some tips or suggestions on where to go as that area has a vast amount of lakes and were only going for 12 days.  Thanks !"

315693,troutologist,2009-03-10 17:34:00,951,Ive passed by obatanga many times heading to the white lake/regan area but never stopped to fish it. I hear both PPs offer good walleye fishing. I'd be interested to hear how you make out.  Best of luck.
315694,Dan668,2009-03-10 17:39:00,1120,we went two years ago. Great pike fishing in some of the lakes around. Numerous fish caught. Nothing huge. Biggest were just over 10lbs.
