315049,randy jennings,2009-03-09 03:38:00,6,"Hey there,  I just picked up a 2 man Frabill ice hut from CTC in Oshawa. (across from Oshawa Centre) Regular 300 for only 150 ! Great deal!"
315051,irishfield,2009-03-09 03:42:00,26272,Did yours come with the folding seats... or the 3 leg camp chairs?? Troutnmuskiehunter got the camp chairs with his... not the folding shown in the manual and like I got last year with mine.
315060,discophish,2009-03-09 04:35:00,392,"- To spend or not to spend -  Over the many years I have accumulated ice fishing gear that stacks like a lead pyramid on my sled.  It's getting out of control.  The walks are progressively becoming a threat rather than something to look forward to.  Obsession and impulse are two things that light your way through the store isles, and it makes it hard to pass by something and say ""I don't need it"".  We have the huts, heaters, sleds, rods, tip-ups, augers, tackle bags, too many lures, snow shoes, fuel stoves, cameras, survival suits, goggles, electronics, buckets, bait buckets, lanterns/lights, chairs, gas cans, snacks and food to feed a douzen.  But really, at the end of the day, I wish I went out on the ice with nothing more than some crap stuffed into my pockets to create a little more bulge to make the walk more honourable, if you know what I mean.  If I really think about this, I buy 10 new lures that I don't need, try to stuff it in a tackle bag that is too full to stuff, end up using and old scuffed up rusty lure and not any of the new lures for the entire day because the walk was too exhausting and lazy to rummage through the stuffed bag that makes it impossible to find anything, rip open a package, and tie something else on.  Anything new hasn't helped me catch more fish.  New things only catch the consumer.  I lived to tell the experience weekend after weekend, and for most of this winter.  I broke my back drilling about a hundred holes this weekend in Haliburton, hauled everything out including the weight of a frothy jowled moose and 6 rabid deer, and couldn't find a fish by the end.  Of course that's the way it goes.  You become consumed either way ... buy stuff you don't need, and pretending to fish for fish that aren't there.  At some point things get ruined when it becomes too much.  I'm going to start stuffing my bulge from now on and leave the rest in the place that has no room for anything including itself.  I think I wrote this because my winter wasn't so good.  Cranky?  Perhaps, but I still want to bulge.  Disco Phish"
315106,Fishmaster,2009-03-09 13:16:00,920,Crap Tire needs to have a 50% off sale just to match the small stores retail prices lol..Buck Shots $8.99 Big Os $8.39 what a steal opps Rip Off...thing i love is when guys leave Crap Tire walk into my shop and see they just paid allmost double at CT of what i charge ...
315301,JMahon,2009-03-09 21:09:00,48,"I agree that they are a rip off!   I really only go to CT if there's a ""supposed"" sale to see what they got..99% of the time I leave disappointed & disgusted at their prices!    Hell, I've noticed even wally mart has uped the prices on their fishing equipment!   ex. A spinnerbait I could buy last year for $4.99 is now $9.69! Unless I come across a good deal, or really need something, you won't see me shoppin at these places!  Hey FM, maybe you can tell me, what's the deal on the Clackin Raps?  Why so expensive? Just cuz they are new?    CT here has them for $14.99 & WM sellin'em for about $11"
315307,Fishmaster,2009-03-09 21:29:00,920,Like all Rapala Cranks they are way to much $$$ they say the retail is $14.99 in the book but they go by 70 to 100% mark up I use a way lower  mark up instead  thats why i sell a ton of  Rapala Cranks for $10.99 and thats even to much money for a lure in my books ...
314149,discophish,2009-03-06 22:11:00,392,"Just letting everyone know about the big Canadian Tire sale on most ice fishing gear, incl. augers and huts!  They never go on for half.  Suits too.  Sale starts tomorrow!  Hmm, but with the Sportsmen's Show coming up ...."
314150,FISHINGNUT,2009-03-06 22:20:00,253,"Ice fishing sale!!! 50% off, Spend or not to spend Dont worry remember its Canadian tire they wont have anything in stock   thanks for the heads up"
314155,Handlebarz,2009-03-06 22:24:00,3790,Yep CTC here sucks hard they dont know how to have anything in stock that is in there flyer.
314169,waterwolf,2009-03-06 23:18:00,556," all to true ,, what a pant load these sales are ,, reel in the masses . oh ,, you can count on me being there ,, for sure ,, just in case."
314171,irishfield,2009-03-06 23:24:00,26272,Well the flyer doesn't say what is for sale.... but I gotta go to CTC anyhow tomorrow...so I'll see what I can spend. If I get a few augers at 1/2 price how many na sayers want to buy them at 75% retail?
314177,Roy,2009-03-06 23:36:00,13728,"I've never ever had a problem with Canadian Tire. I give them about $100 a week which surely isn't making them rich but I know what to expect when I go there. I've purchased things there that didn't fit, wasn't what I wanted, was defective...whatever, and have always had an easy time bringing the item back for an exchange or refund. I see Canadian Tire as a convenience store for anything you might need that's not food. It's Sunday and a faucet springs a leak... I can get washers there....that kinda thing.  You want to buy something specifically for ice fishing? Go to a specialty shop. Don't complain about them not being so good at having all the latest and best products out there...it's just not their vocation. As for having in stock what's on sale..well....it's a national outfit and there are any one of a number of reasons why your particular location doesn't have it. It's not a big deal.....I won't get upset over it."
314218,Handlebarz,2009-03-07 01:00:00,3790,"Our store here in Chatham was great up to a couple years ago when a new owner took over, the old store had everything you needed when you went in and the employees to help you out then the new guy comes in and cleans house the managers are changed and let go new CHEAPER help is brought in and the service went down hill here it sure does suck as I loved the store until it changed hands.  I dont know who the owner is but dont care for alot of the changes we have here heck this year I think there might have been 3 ice rods in there all year long a dozen or so lures and not much more when in years past they had a great selection in Dec and it was always gone by end of Jan or early Feb.  Like you said Roy I dont go there for special fishing stuff I am lucky to hit BPS gander and Janns Net Craft I am kinda spoiled that way to have alot of choices not to mention the locals here and Angling Outfitters these places always come through.  It just sucks when they have a flyer and then you go in and find out that they dont have the stuff and in alot of cases they never did the old store was great but what can ya do."
314223,irishfield,2009-03-07 01:14:00,26272,"Well if you ever wanted an ice auger.. now's the time to track one down. ALL 6 power models they carry are on sale at 1/2 price as are all hand augers.. every single one they carry. Sale is already on... a day early, so stuff may be sparse by tomorrow."
314226,diggyj,2009-03-07 01:20:00,548,"Hearing about that sale could be bad news. I'm not an ice fisher, but this sale may persuade me to just go out and purchase the required gear should I choose to take it up. CONTEMPLATION.  The wife would never see me then.  Dirk..."
314230,irishfield,2009-03-07 01:25:00,26272,Is what happened to me last year Dirk... power auger and 2 man hut.  Just did a quick search on the 2HP Jiffy Legend Lightning Power Auger and there are at least 5 stores in Toronto with it in stock.
314231,Leecher,2009-03-07 01:25:00,7832," Hey Dirk, you had your chances the other day for your first ice outing LOL  J/K LOL  Go for it my friend    It's totally different from soft water"
314238,DRIFTER_016,2009-03-07 01:43:00,10439,"  My store up here in Yellowknife doesn't have any power augers but they do have a bunch of hand augers as well as a one man polar express shelter and a 2 man ice cube. Errrrrr I mean used to have a 2 man ice cube.  Can't go wrong for $130 +GST. Now tomorrow I will return the one man polar express shelter I bought at the beginning of the season for $105 +GST. Nice upgrade for 25 bucks!!!!!!! There is nothing wrong with the one man, it's just too small."
314244,bbog,2009-03-07 01:59:00,665,Remember everyone it is a CLEARANCE of what is left over. So lets not have a repeat of last year when certain people got their shorts in a knot.
314246,discophish,2009-03-07 02:02:00,392,"You can go to their site and follow up on what they have in their ice fishing area.  They have store availability, but that doesn't necessarily mean that they have it.  I suggest you call first for what you are looking to buy.  If only this sale was on when I bought my replacement jiffy that was stolen out of my garage this year!  CTC was good to me through high school and college, so I'm fairly loyal to them at times.  It was fun working their as a kid!  Good luck and be safe on the ice from now."

But I did manage  to drop $150 on more ice tackle I really dont need but who can resist 1/2 price  The Waterloo store had a lot of lures and rods but all the combos were already gone I got the last windless tip up and HT rod case wish they had more of those ,Now to find a place for all these new lures till next season"
314266,GeorgeJ,2009-03-07 02:32:00,207,"Just got back with a 8"" Jiffy auger 3hp two stroke, $225 I'm very excited I would have paid $150 for a very used one  2 weeks ago but it sold before I could get there to get it. Out of 5 CT in a 45 minute range from my house 2 had them in stock, all the 10"" were sold out or maybe they never carried them."

Kerry"
314407,lunkerbasshunter,2009-03-07 14:13:00,2585,yeah remember this is a clearance sale so if your local store doesnt have anything its because they already sold out.  i like ctc they are a canadian company and i rather support them then there big us competitors. sure ctc isnt perfect but what retailer is?  cheers!
314521,bbog,2009-03-07 18:15:00,665,"Just came back from Pickering Parkway store (in Pickering of course). They had a 3HP Jiffy 8"" Auger for $224 and a 2 man Sub-Zero hut for $125. If you want them you'd better hurry or call ahead to hold. They are new in boxes and hadn't sold already because they were hidden on the top shelf."
314681,alexmedic,2009-03-08 00:59:00,186,"The CTC in south-end Barrie, had the majority of rods sold.  No huts or augers left, but still a great selection of lures, as of Saturday afternoon."
314879,mjack 7,2009-03-08 18:42:00,22,"Hopefully parts will be accesible for tecumseh engines for a long time as they went under back in December,   After so may decades the U.S. company could no longer compete with china made engines.  So most of the power augers next year by jiffy and strike master will be considerally less expensive due to the new chinese engines.     That being said there engines are very relaible, as long as there maintained.   CDn tire is loosing alot of dollars on every auger so by them up."

314969,DRIFTER_016,2009-03-08 23:25:00,10439,  Shouldn't be an issue as they were bought out last month. This is from another board:  Tecumseh engine company has been purchased. Janesville businessman Jim Grafft on Monday bought the assets of the engine division of Tecumseh Power Co. and plans to move the operation to Rock County.
