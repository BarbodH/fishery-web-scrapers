Was wondering if anyone had any information and knew of any spots you can fish from shore? I've tried scouting using Google!Earth and Google!Maps - but resulted in only showing 1/4 of the lake."
315069,Spiel,2009-03-09 10:26:00,9065,Is this the Little Lake on the north east side of Puslinch Lake?
315084,danbouck,2009-03-09 11:46:00,4380, Yes it is.  In my experience fishing from shore isn't that great but I've usually taken a little boat in there and caught a few perch and pike. I'm sure you can find a spot on shore that will produce.
315086,Spiel,2009-03-09 11:54:00,9065,"Yep, pike and perch as well as largemouth and crappie. Personally I've only fished it through the ice."
