Having seen them featured on TV, and having visited the website, they look like they offer some amazing fishing, especially the walleye outpost trip. (Camping on a small tributary of Lake Superior, I believe, while the walleye are in full swing during August).  So, I'm just wondering if anyone has been, or if anyone has heard anything - good, or bad.  Thanks for your thoughts and information."

315325,mikeratface,2009-03-09 22:03:00,7,pasha lake is a home base. I think the outpost is on Lake Nipigon which is 1/2 hr drive plus a good boat ride. We use to go to Onamen Lake that was a 45 min. drive plus a 20min. walk great walleye fishing. I haven't been in 7yrs. Lately they have been going to Northwind. lots of little lake to go to as long as you have a truck to get you in.
