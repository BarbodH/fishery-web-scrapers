315359,purekgw,2009-03-09 23:34:00,585,can you run 2 deep cycle batteries on a 12v trolling motor to make it run longer or can you only use one at a time ?  if you can how would you do this?
315366,Roy,2009-03-09 23:40:00,13728,Yes you can but they have to be connected in parallel...here's a link that will help you.  http://www.nyc-arecs.org/Connecting_Batter...nd_Parallel.pdf

315453,Sinker,2009-03-10 02:08:00,8692,"Just make sure your batteries are the same. You will only get as much power as your lesser battery. If you use an old one with a new one, you'll only have as much power as the old one. Then its better to run them separate.  Sinker"
315475,bigfish1965,2009-03-10 02:31:00,3382,How long are you getting out of a charge? i was going 3 or 4 days of heavy use per charge on a deep cycle.
