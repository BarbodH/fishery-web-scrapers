314336,snag,2009-03-07 05:53:00,1932,"It took far too long, but douG and I finally met up. We had great plans but the ice ruined our fishing expectation.  No matter, we took it very easy and chatted while lazily chucking lures at ice chunks.  Even ran into Diggyj-Dirk. (We’ll meet again!)  I warned Doug that we might be mess’d by the ice. He didn’t mind and we agreed that simply meeting was essential.  He INSISTED on bringing his famous sandwiches (‘quiches) How could I say no?? One roast beef w/provolone and one Salami w/ provolone both on fresh Panini’s  Massive  Meaty   He kept leering at them? Suspiciously........  ""What’s the big deal""? you’re thinking? ""It’s just a sandwich""??  Well, one bite and I went into lala-land Mmmmmmmm  I can’t describe it. You just want more. You need more. You would KILL for another bite.  I composed myself after the last bite. So, when Panini-leering pusher isn’t looking, I slip a sample into my pocket.    Back at the lab I notice a small lump with a red protrusion.    The tweezers find something shocking.    Is this Matrix meat?    Does anyone know what that was???  So I's figures; If it works that good on humans, It must work better on other organisms. Hmmm    The day isn't quite done so I head back out to find an open area.  Success! douG's meat is favoured by other toothy critters!!      Another hit   Tourney Fail.   Cliff, I tried what Glen suggested. Poor camera angle!  Please douG, Don't cut me off. Name your price.  S."

314360,Greencoachdog,2009-03-07 12:07:00,8163,"Another entertaining read and a couple nice fish!  I've had one of douG's Gweeches and they are good!  Don't give up on the tourney entry, I'm sure you'll get it one of these days."
314361,highdrifter,2009-03-07 12:12:00,2534,Good thing for me you're not allowed to fish on weekends...  Time to plunder the ressource!!  Good one budday!!  cheers HD

314379,rockfish,2009-03-07 13:17:00,91,"Pretty funny stuff Grant and nice toothies, guess that was a ""dual"" Matrix pill, since it was both red and and blue, lol."
314387,ehg,2009-03-07 13:47:00,2666," I can see now why those ('gweeches) sandwiches were so popular!  Nice pikes as well, that firetiger pattern seems to be working for ya."
314458,Leecher,2009-03-07 15:54:00,7832,Awesome report and pics Grant  I guess will have to call you Inspector Snag from now on   Nice looking gators and great job Thanks for sharing Jacques
314462,limeyangler,2009-03-07 16:03:00,5204,"too funny, good one guys!"
314467,salmon,2009-03-07 16:22:00,334,Grant Must be Viagara  BTW great report  Jose
314476,douG,2009-03-07 16:45:00,2693,"Grant, that was the funniest fishless fishing report I've read yet.  It was a treat to meet up, with lots o laughs.  I think that it won't be the last - I'll keep a rod and reel and a lure or two in the car for the next coupla weeks.  Thanks."
314487,smokin joe,2009-03-07 17:25:00,226,"Great post and congrats on getting into the toothie critters there snag  Try this for your tournie sign, just keep in mind the more wind the larger the clip to use  "
314538,jwl,2009-03-07 18:56:00,1056,"that's hillarious man, I could use me one of those kind of sandwiches right about now..I am going nuts from not being able to go fishing for like 10-11 days  great report,I don't know where you come up with these demented repotrs, but keep em coming man, they are a laugh and a half"
314571,diggyj,2009-03-07 21:38:00,548,"That report takes the cake. By far, the best, the funniest I have ever seen.  Reminds me of when Gord Stellick used to have people call in for ""Lunchbag Letdown"" lmao  Getting shut out due to mother natures cold fury is one thing, but to then receive such a monster guiche, truly awsome.  Looks like something from Californias or Colangelo Bros. Gonna run out and get me some Mortadella. Seems that mystery meat may be the ticket to big bad Pike.   Maybe that was a GPS chip for Doug to be able to track you to your hotspots?  Cheers, well done guys."
314843,snag,2009-03-08 17:02:00,1932,"Thanks All!   Correction,  I believe it is pronounced ""Gweech""   Pleasure to meet you Doug!   I need more sandwiches. There is a monkey on my back.  "
314844,snag,2009-03-08 17:04:00,1932,"  Thanks Joe,  I think a heavy wind might be an issue though.  I thought you created a tape that had the OFC stuff right on the tape??  Thanks again!"
315521,snag,2009-03-10 04:07:00,1932,"Hey Joe,  We could try this: read the description below!      You love fishing so much that a fish as a belt buckle sounds like a good idea. And that is not all this belt buckle offers you. When you land that monster fish, you can just pull the tape measure that is tucked into this guys mouth. On the dowonside, some may suggest you measure other items that are in the general area of your waist. And that is not good for anyone.   Yup, actual quote with poor grammar and spelling too!  Only $9.99!!!!  Sizing?  I've got nothing to worry about"
315524,Greencoachdog,2009-03-10 04:12:00,8163, I think in your case it would be more fitting if the tape came out of the fishes butt-hole!!!
315530,snag,2009-03-10 04:17:00,1932,"Hey Look Glen!  It's pre-set for you already!    GENEROUSLY, I might add.......  "
315538,Greencoachdog,2009-03-10 04:36:00,8163, Try not to be so jealous!  ... it doesn't become you.  
315591,capt bruce,2009-03-10 13:34:00,820,"Was gonna come out at lunch , but I can see the harbor from my office and too much ice was moving around would of enjoyed to meet Doug . remember Snag the first ones are free and than before ya know it Dougs yours and selling Carp at the corner of Spadina and dundas to get enough for maybe a bite of an open faced no more Panini's for you ..
