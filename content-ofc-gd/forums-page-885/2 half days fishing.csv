HEADED OUT AND FOUND A GROOMED TRAIL TO A SPOT I""D CAUGHT NICE 26"" WALLEYE IN THE SUMMER        SOMEONE ELSE ALSO THOUGHT THIS A GOOD SPOT, THEY DRAGGED THEIR SHACK OVER 6 MILES TO PUT IT THERE         IT WAS A BEUTIFUL AFTERNOON,  I SET UP AND WAITED....AND WAITED.............NOT EVEN A FISH ON SCREEN FOR 2 HOURS!        I WAS ACTUALLY PACKING UP TO LEAVE WHEN MY OTHER  LINE WENT, GOT THIS LITTLE GUY        THEN I WAITED FOR ANOTHER COUPLE OF HOURS AFTER THE PIKE THATR GOT ME TO STAY....WATCHED THE SUN SLOWLY SINKING, ANTICIPATING BIG WALLEYE        I MOVED OVER ABOUT 50 YARDS TO A HOLE IN BEHIND A ROCK I KNEW WAS THERE FROM TROLLING IN MY BOAT, AND THERE WERE SOME WALLEYE HIDING IN THERE! NOT BIG BUT BETTER THAN I HAVE BEEN CATCHING ON WABIGOON ALL WINTER                    IT WENT QUIET FOR TWENTY MINUTES, THEN I GOT MY FIRST WABIGOON WHITEFISH IN JUST OVER 7 FEET OF WATER ON A GLOW JIG AND MINNOW. A REAL FATTY            After that little excursion I was itching to get out again so took off early in the morning across Lake Wabigoon from the house to Thunder Lake for some trout fishing, really nice weather we had this weekend, not a cloud in the sky yesterday and today, no wind either! perfect for buzzin about the lakes.     SET OFF FROM THE HOUSE EARLY, A BIT CRISP OUT, BUT ANOTHER GORGEOUS DAY       STUNNING MORNING ON THUNDER LAKE, AND IT WAS WARMING UP  A BIT, BUT UNFORTUNATELY NOT ENOUGH TO BE OUTSIDE THE SHELTER AT 9AM        WAS MARKING LOTS OF BAITFISH, AND SOME ACTIVITY ON THE BOTTOM IN 43 FOW, STARTED OFF WITH ONLY MY 3RD EVER THUNDER LAKE WALLEYE       AFTER THAT I GOT INTO A SMALLER TROUT AFTER A BIG ONE CAUGHT THE BOTTOM OF THE ICE AND I WATCHED IT SWIM AWAY       I MISSED ANOTHER 2 DECENT ONES, THEN GOT THIS WEE BABY TROUT       THEN SOME WALLEYE CAME THROUGH ON THE BOTTOM, REALLY DIFFICULT TO GET THEM TO BITE, BUT GOT ANOTHER IN THE END      That was it , packed up soon after that walleye and headed home, great few hours over the weekend.     ."

315093,bigugli,2009-03-09 12:31:00,6138,I'm just plain jealous I am    That is some fun fishing you are having up there.
315121,limeyangler,2009-03-09 13:49:00,5204,"   Thanks, but i dont think its as great as jumping in my own plane and taking my pick of the lakes....lol....you gotta drop by my house with that toy of yours and take me fishing, damn we could get into some god lakes!         Thanks Jacques, i have to admit that once again it was you that i have to blame, your reply to my post the other day asking for pics/vids really got me out the door, thanks bud! and thanks for your well wishes for baby Limey.        yup, i'm really enjoying being mobile this winter, was mobile last winter.....dragging my @#$# around on my pink plastic sleigh, but the snowmobile is an awesome piece of fishing tackle!"
