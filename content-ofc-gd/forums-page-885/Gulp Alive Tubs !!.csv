315203,rbaquial,2009-03-09 17:51:00,968,Good question!! I'm curious to find out the answer too...
315205,jwl,2009-03-09 17:56:00,1056," try a couple out in a small container for a couple days......if ya got 5 tubs and they are taking up too much room, I would gladly take one of the tube of ""juice"" of your hands next time I see ya"
315207,Bondar,2009-03-09 17:58:00,817,ill keep you posted Jack
315247,hirk,2009-03-09 19:24:00,571,"They won't bleed,you can buy mixed tubs now with different colors."
315267,Beats,2009-03-09 20:07:00,543,"  Yeah, I've seen the mixed pack as well.  I think it was different styles of bait with a variety of colours, if I remember correctly."
315383,danbouck,2009-03-10 00:07:00,4380,I've mixed some and it has been fine.
315641,Blake,2009-03-10 16:05:00,418,Yes you can mix any Gulp Alive products in the same tubs without any issues.  They even sell assorted tubs with different colours of baits now in one tub.  You can also put any regular Gulp in the tubs also to recharge and they won't bleed.  Hope this helps.
315704,legacey,2009-03-10 18:24:00,127,I too have mixed....but out of need.  Crappy container spilled all over the boat and wifes purse....had to put all those in the one that spilled into another one.  Cheers
