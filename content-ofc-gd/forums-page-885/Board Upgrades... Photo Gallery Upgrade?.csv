I think that most members would agree that if any section of the board needed upgrading it would be the gallery.  I've pretty much declined to use the photo gallery because of all extra work to shrink pics and stuff.  I'm not trying to insult the existing gallery, you do what you can... but it would be nice to see an upgraded gallery."
