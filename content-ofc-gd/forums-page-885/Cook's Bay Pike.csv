Set up shop in 9 fow and baited my tip-up with a 9 inch Portugese sardine, not even 20 minutes later bam fish on!!! I would guess she was around 34-36 inches.. The next 2 hours was non stop action and all the pike were caught on deadbait... Marked a fish on the finder and peered down the hole wow a nice size Pike sniffed my jig a few times then swam off wasnt intrested in my plastic minnow...The area produces some nice size Pike and it just so happens I'm on afternoons all week so I can catch the moring bite all fish hit between 8 and 11am..   Although I only landed two it was still a awesome morning...."
