Went 3/6 from 7 till 10: 30 in water that was pretty much milk. Big honkin roe bags were the trick for the first monster female. I didnt get a picture with me holding it (solo mission) but its my PB hen, pushing 12 pounds for sure an absolute slob of a fish.  Hard to judge size from the pic but keep in mind that my pin is 5"", and the fish makes it look like a cheerio.    That was by far the strongest fight I have ever had from a steelie,  I was fishing withing 500m of the lake and the fish were FRESH out of the big water. Really wish I had a pic of me showing how monsterous the fish really was.  After that  I lost three straight    ah well it happens when you are using gigantic bags and tiny hook.  Next up was a nice fish that inhaled one of my jigs tipped with a pinky    For size reference, this fish ( a solid lake O fish) was completely dwarfed by the first one. Made a respectable fish look silly.  Didnt get a picture of the last one but it also fell to a jig and was between the size of the first two. Its tough to get a picture up to your waist in fast water. Nothing small in the river today.  ...and I apologise to team 2, forgot my sign and measuring tape today. I wasnt really expecting this kind of fishing but dont worry I have lots of trout left in me!"
314536,MCTFisher9120,2009-03-07 18:46:00,3761,Good job Kemper! I'll have to take a walk to the creek and see if there's any fish up where i am  Thanks for sharing!
314537,Leecher,2009-03-07 18:51:00,7832,Great report and pics Kemp  Those are real nice looking trout you got into    congratulations Just never know what to expect when venturing onto new territory  Great job and thanks for sharing Leechman
314564,trapshooter,2009-03-07 21:10:00,1234,Congrats on a PB Kemper.  Still a nice pic of your fish even though you're not holding it.

314664,ccmtcanada,2009-03-08 00:32:00,7971,Way to go Kemper!  Just so happen to have some monster roe bags tied...problem is I'm sure things will be completely blown tomorrow
314669,BUSTER,2009-03-08 00:39:00,1336,nice job!  so when you got home did you insert sign and tape into vest?  lol
314673,TroutnMuskieHunter,2009-03-08 00:46:00,1362,Nice bow Kemper...congrats!!
314676,Joeytier,2009-03-08 00:48:00,3990,"I'm sure the creeks will be well over the banks by tomorrow morning, unfortunately."
314698,BillM,2009-03-08 01:35:00,17367,Good job man!!!  Got into a couple up on the Sauble today  :)
314717,Greencoachdog,2009-03-08 02:48:00,8163, Use them for Burbot bait thru the ice on Simcoe at night!!!   ...Troot is overgrown minnows!!!
314796,kemper,2009-03-08 14:50:00,2232,"thanks dudes,  Really not impressed that I have to head back to guelph for the next two weeks, fishing is  going to be UNREAL"
314832,snag,2009-03-08 16:26:00,1932,"Good job Kemper,  Good to see that I'm not the only one failing our team!   Pics are a tricky thing. I'm usually disappointed with the pics of a big fish when I view them later.  A 2lb fish can look 10lbs and vice versa. but that looks like a beast for sure!  "
315163,kemper,2009-03-09 16:09:00,2232,"a bumpetty bump for HD on this fine monday morning.  every time I look at how small the first pic makes that monster look i get sad.  Note to self, FREAKIN TRIPOD"
315167,highdrifter,2009-03-09 16:36:00,2534, OH hahaah!  Thanks doode.  Beauties!
315169,solopaddler,2009-03-09 16:42:00,8605,"That's a biggun' for sure, good job!"
