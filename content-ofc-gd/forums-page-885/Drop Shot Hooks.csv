315135,diggyj,2009-03-09 14:34:00,548,"I normally just use the GAMAKATSU DROPSHOT HOOKS when dropshotting but saw these new DAIICHI STANDOUT HOOKS. Does anyone use them? Any advantages?  The small arm on the Standout hook forces the hook to always remain in the proper postion, but if you tie the Palomar knot correctly with the Regular Gamakatsu Dropshot Hook, it does that anyways. Thanks.....  Dirk..."
315139,dheitzner,2009-03-09 14:47:00,314,"I use the ""Gamees"" myself, didn't like the stand outs so much: found them to be extremely dull out of the package and didn't hold the bait in the proper position that well."
315158,hirk,2009-03-09 16:04:00,571,"Dirk I sell the Diachi's but fish with Gammy circles  ,you have the best set-up now."
315209,diggyj,2009-03-09 18:01:00,548,"Dave,  you are so right, I've been using that rod a bit on my last few outings to get a feel for it and is so so awsome. Super sensitive, lightweight, casts a mile, great all round rod. Have yet to land one with it but that will come.  Cheers and thanks,  Dirk......"
315244,misfish,2009-03-09 19:22:00,29133,I use owner 1/0 2/0 dropshot hooks.Very thin and strong and also very sharp.
315250,hirk,2009-03-09 19:27:00,571,"Yup the owner downshot hook is a good one too,especially if you rig the bait texas due to the long shank."
315271,Markystang,2009-03-09 20:12:00,131,"I've used and like the stand out hooks, but they're all I've used for dropshotting, so i can't compare."
315279,Dan668,2009-03-09 20:27:00,1120,i use the owner ones. i like em
315289,ecmilley,2009-03-09 20:46:00,2163,I really like the owner 1/0 2/0 sizes for texas rigging when fishing weedy areas and use short shank gamu's when nose hooking my drop shot offering in rocks current areas
315292,Cudz,2009-03-09 20:54:00,2652,"I use size 2, 1, or 1/0 octupus.  Usually Gamagatsu or owner."
315376,walleyemen,2009-03-09 23:56:00,316,"I use nothing but the owner hooks , best on the market, i have about 100 of the stand outs and am willing to give them away , nice idea, crappy quality!"
315398,Mark Kulik,2009-03-10 00:33:00,348,I use Owners -especially when $$ on the line!
315419,tschirk,2009-03-10 01:06:00,261,I've never tried Owner's just Gammy's. What makes the Owner's better? I'd like to try them...
315423,Greencoachdog,2009-03-10 01:14:00,8163, They is the Katz   !!!
315479,walleyemen,2009-03-10 02:39:00,316,"The hook point of a owner hook is cut like the end of a syringe, instead of poking threw it's more like a double edged knife, nver lost a fish on a owner hook ."
