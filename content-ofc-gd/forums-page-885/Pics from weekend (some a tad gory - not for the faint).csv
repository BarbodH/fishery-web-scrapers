314123,Peps,2009-03-06 20:50:00,191,"great report and beauty spec!!!  i'm no wolf expert, but that doesn't look like a wolf to me......the snout looks to short and the ears are to rounded.  looks more like a sled dog to me (husky)   Peps"
314126,highdrifter,2009-03-06 21:16:00,2534, Ya know I was thinking the same thing?  Could it be a cross?
314130,highdrifter,2009-03-06 21:22:00,2534,Oh and Glen...  Psycho Killer... qu'est-ce que c'est?  FA-FA-FA--FA-FA-FA-FA-FA  ETAAHH!!!  WUUUUUUTTT
314188,Moosebunk,2009-03-07 00:03:00,3970,"Yes man!!!  Must agree with the rest, your snowshoes and frosty beardin' paid off with a beaut.  Nice job guys."
314299,Paulus,2009-03-07 04:00:00,522,"Christie'd belle truite, Môssieu!  I liked the shot of the wolf/sled dog, too. That's reality in the Wild. Looks pretty cleaned up... When you said that there was some gore in your post I thought you meant that you might be touching the fish's gills in the pics or something  Spring is here, or close enough, so.........  p.-"
314305,camillj,2009-03-07 04:12:00,1988,Wow .. great speck ! Now those tracks are definitely worth following !   I agree .. it looks like a sled dog more than a wolf
315109,WeedLine,2009-03-09 13:19:00,322,"If that speck is a cookie cutter average from that lake, I would love to see the big ones outta there. Great fish none the less! You earned it."
313805,highdrifter,2009-03-06 01:49:00,2534,"Hi gang,  Billy-Curtiss and myself fished the back lakes this weekend for brookies.  A friend of Billy's has a trap line up this old logging road and had invited Billy to come up for a few days..  so of course I invited myself up too!!  Our efforts were hampered by the extremes..  Deep snow..  a foot of slush on the lakes..  and some bone chillin cold.. We even had a little visit from the law on Saturday and he made us empty the last of our beers..  But we did have an incredible experience..  And I even managed to ice the one fish of the weekend.  A FAT 21 incher!  I'll just save the banter.  It's been a heck of day, and we all know why were here.  Hardcore fish porn!!   Billy-Curtiss breaking trail to the camp.     Ya like my new kicks?!  They're made with authentic babish!     First lake we fished, just a little ways from the camp.  The snow would come later that night..  The calm before the storm..  It was incredible!     We had a wolf cross the lake just as Dan poked through with his sled.  We were hauling the gear behind him ahahah!     Here's what really made the trip.. My personal best brookie!!  A cookie cutter speck (the lake is stocked), but she tasted just as good..   We'll leave the best lakes for the spring, when we won't have to worry about covering our tracks.      Had to get the halos..  Shame it wasn't a wild fish..     Billy:  ""Is there something funny about my beard??""     Dan:  ""Where's your fro comb?!""     Saw a bald eagle feeding on some carrion a little ways into the logging road.  It wasn't until we were making our way back into town when we found out what it was the bird was feeding on.  No meal here can be passed up, however gruesome.  I was feeling queezy after seeing this..  your imagination tends to wander..     Just a puppy too from the looks of it..     Here's another puppy..  Dan's dog.  An Argentine Dogo!  A fine animal, once it warmed up to us.     10 months old, and 105lbs!!  Just awesome.     I'm a man of few words.  Gnight everybody!!  luv, HD"
313812,Leecher,2009-03-06 02:03:00,7832,Great report and pics Highdrifter  Une très belle speck que tu as pris    Félicitation  Je ne pense pas que ce loup était un petit car ces pattes sembles grosse pour cette animal. Je pense plutôt qu'il était vieux et c'est pour ça qu'il est devenue la proie  Looks like you guys had a blast and again great job you guys Thanks for sharing Jacques

313822,Sinker,2009-03-06 02:15:00,8692,Doncha just looove those specks!!  Looks like a great time fella's.......  Sinker
313824,Leecher,2009-03-06 02:17:00,7832, Oui c'est domage de voir un si grand prédateur de nos forest devenir proie aux grand oiseaux comme les aigles
313826,highdrifter,2009-03-06 02:18:00,2534, Will do Mike.  Let's git 'er done!
313828,Mike the Pike,2009-03-06 02:20:00,3421,Good report I had no idea an eagle was that powerful

313861,Joey,2009-03-06 03:20:00,9122,"What a great report Fidel.  That is an awesome fish.  Very cool pics     Wonder what took down that animal?  Well, life goes on tho and I imagine it fed a slew of other animals.  Joey"
313862,trapshooter,2009-03-06 03:35:00,1234,"That's a great spec, congrats.  Looks like a fun trip you guys had."
313863,Cudz,2009-03-06 03:38:00,2652,Be careful of your buddy's dog.  105 pounds and he looks powerful and in the last pic he is sporting a 'red-on' !!!! He might have his way with you. Good luck with that. PS  Nice Speck!
313866,highdrifter,2009-03-06 03:45:00,2534, LMAO!!  I hear ya.. Whatya do when a dog tries to mount you and gets snarly when you try to push him off?!!
313885,Cudz,2009-03-06 04:27:00,2652, I guess you just take it and be his poodle (provided you are talking about your leg).
