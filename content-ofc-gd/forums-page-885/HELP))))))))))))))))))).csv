315543,ohhenrygsr,2009-03-10 05:13:00,947,check out Bass Pro shop they have an excellent spot i'm sure you'll find the honey hole LOL.  yea your only about 1hr-2hr drive from really good fishing grounds check out google maps for the lakes in that distance
315544,yo_guy,2009-03-10 05:30:00,111,"If you like Perch you are approximately 45 min away from Gilford and Lefroy. Fish near 14 fow to 30 fow as a starting point and you can go deeper or shallower for that matter. Hook and minnows works well but so do the tiny Rapala jigging raps etc...  If you want whitefish and lake trout, Kemp area is about the same distance give or take a little and try Bear Point, Big Bay Point, Innisfil Beach, 6th line 8th line etc... You can find these fish in the 80 fow range as a start and you can can go way shallow or way deeper. You can use hook and minnows, williams jigging spoon, bad boys, meegs, blue fox foxxies etc....  That should get you started!!!"
