If your thinking of a new bait caster this reel deserves a serious look better than my new curados and  picked it up on sale at Hirk's in courtice for 165 with a rod purchase (also can't wait to feel a big bucket pulling on the all-star rod i grabbed)"
315218,Drew_10,2009-03-09 18:21:00,111,"I love Shimano Stradics when it comes to spinning gear, but for baitcasters, the Revo is the way to go IMO.  A top of the line Abu Garcia for the price of a mid-range shimano.  I hope you enjoy your new SX!"
315269,Dan668,2009-03-09 20:12:00,1120,i just picked up the revo stx. excellent reel imo. Liked it a lot better than the new curado.
315306,Joeytier,2009-03-09 21:28:00,3990,"I'm in the market for a new baitcaster for a pitching outfit, and I'm leaning heavily towards the Curado.  I like the Ambassadeurs, but I've had a TON of problems with Abu's spinning reels lately, so I'm unsure as to whether or not I want to give them another chance."
315316,Dan668,2009-03-09 21:46:00,1120,"well i have an older curado. both are good. the revo feels more solid, also got it because i prefer the magnetic braking system and it has a superior drag."
