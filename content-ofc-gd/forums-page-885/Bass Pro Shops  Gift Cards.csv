314803,Muskieman,2009-03-08 15:11:00,2472,I'm trying to redeem my BPS  Gift Cards on -line I have 3 cards each values at 50$  but when I punch in the pin to try to check out they tell me that's it's only worth 40$.......Any Ideas?   Thanks  RFS 
314804,Gerritt,2009-03-08 15:12:00,6129,perhaps they are rounding the exchange rate.....
314805,JohnF,2009-03-08 15:12:00,3494,  Sounds like it's converting to US$$  JF
314808,Muskieman,2009-03-08 15:16:00,2472,  That's what I'm thinking.... I should call customer service
314811,Handlebarz,2009-03-08 15:22:00,3790,if they are converting that is a good rate if I did the math right at $1.25 you are ahead unless it is more then your out the door price here.
314812,2jack2,2009-03-08 15:23:00,92,"If you have a Canadian $ gift card, it will convert to US$ when you check on the web-site. When you are buying from the web-site, you are paying in US$."
314814,ColdH20guy,2009-03-08 15:30:00,312,I also got one for Christmas that is burning a hole in my pocket: I was going to order on line but found the same thing...road trip to BPS soon!
314816,Cudz,2009-03-08 15:37:00,2652,I too got one for Christmas and I was at the sale yesterday and forgot to use it
314906,ColdH20guy,2009-03-08 20:44:00,312,so what did you pick up 'cause I have a feeling you didnt come away empty handed! lol
314916,MCTFisher9120,2009-03-08 21:06:00,3761,Yup i had the same problem. The BPS web site is in US funds so it automatically converts it.
315620,2jack2,2009-03-10 15:07:00,92,"If our dollors goes up again like last year, you gift card will worth more on line! CAN$50 gift card may equal to US$55! keep waiting. although I don't think it will happening soon....."
315621,Stoty,2009-03-10 15:15:00,2910,"What happens if you buy a card up here, and use it at a US store.....? I'll be in Fort Myers next week..."
315677,Whopper,2009-03-10 16:57:00,2174, It will be converted from Canadian funds to US funds I went through this last year
315678,Stoty,2009-03-10 17:00:00,2910,Darn!  Thanks.
315680,TennesseeGuy,2009-03-10 17:03:00,957,Better not to look a gift card in the mouth of an exchange rate.
315682,Whopper,2009-03-10 17:09:00,2174, True  Plus from the sounds of it pricing is better on this side of the border
