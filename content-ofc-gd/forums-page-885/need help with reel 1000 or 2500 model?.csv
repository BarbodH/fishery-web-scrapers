Is there more to this reel or ..  stradic priced well, but I want to try something a tad diferent possibly..but 100$ difference..will i even notice?  stradic mgfb anyones thoughts..???? not even much light even though magnesium?  Now, it will be for a dropshot rod, ML  whats the best size to go with? 1000 is what i was thinking for weight, Ihave never done under 6 lbs...but want to try 4....is 4 lb on a ML strong enough for solid hooksets etc.?  help me decide please, I kinda want a 1000 but am affraid i will end up with a 2500(not that its a bad thing either...)  thanks! -Mark"
314728,Garry2Rs,2009-03-08 03:16:00,1425,"I owe a 9 or ten year old Stradic 1000.  Since I use baitcasters for anything over about a 1/4 ounce, it's my favourite spinning reel, Last year I landed a large mouth of over 5 pounds and several Smallies of over three pounds with it. I was using 10 pound Power Pro on it. The 2500 might be a better all around size, but for plastic worms and drop shot-ting I love the smaller reel. When I bought this reel I felt the Stradic sat at the point of diminishing returns.  Up to that price you got quite a bit more each time you moved up a price bracket.  After the Stradic the steps were bigger and the additional gain was smaller."
314731,Raf,2009-03-08 03:21:00,3495,i think you'll enjoy the 1000 size a lot more for that application.  2500 series reels are good all-round reels if you need them to do many things but for a specific ML application the smaller reel will be better IMO  i can't comment on the stradic vs sustain
314732,trapshooter,2009-03-08 03:29:00,1234,"Stradics have been great to me.  I own 5 - 2 1000's and 3 2500's.  I honestly like my 1000's better.  Lots of size for a walleye/drop shot combo AND I use both my 1000's all winter on ice rods.  Double duty, gotta love that."
314757,rhare,2009-03-08 10:20:00,387,"I only use stradics they are the best bang for your buck.  I have mostly 2500 and 3000.   I find the 1000 too small for most of what I do.  The mgfb is a sweet reel, its a little lighter but not all that much. the new FI's are deadly and unless money is bo object I would save the extra cash and get a FI.  The 3000 series has a sweet paddle handle and holds a bit more line, great for braid. you can also interchange your 3000 and 2500 spools.  I personally think a 2500 would be a better all round reel, but it comes down to what suits your needs"
314781,walleyemen,2009-03-08 13:00:00,316,"i use the the 1000 for dropshotting and i find it balances out the rod more in your hands than the heavier 2000  or 2500 series, nothing but 6 pound 100% berkely fluro never had a problem or break off fishing erie for smallies, before buying bring in your rod and put both on you will see what i mean, good luck with your purchase.Wayne"
315724,Guest buick14,2009-03-10 18:58:00,0,"thanks for the help, here was my conclusion:  The stradic was probably the best bang for the buck, but I noticed a difference between the sustain and the stradic for sure....now the mgfb, I noticed no difference except price and color  So I got a sustain...  The 1000 series balanced much better with the rod without a doubt....but there were no 1000 sizes left, so I got the 2500  I am still happy with my decision, as I feel with time it will be more versatile for me, and I may feel that little bit better knowing I can change it up if I wanted  thanks for all the help again! -Mark"
315747,Dan668,2009-03-10 19:29:00,1120,i bought a 2500. obv heavier but the extra line makes it more versatile. The difference in weight is barely noticeable in some series of reels.
