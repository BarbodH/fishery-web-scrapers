315155,BillM,2009-03-09 15:47:00,17367," No other boats out, except for a car topper that was ramming ice at the mouth.   All that room and they decide to smash ice about 15ft from us.  I am sure the fish enjoyed all that noise."
315157,fishnsled,2009-03-09 15:53:00,3520,Great report gentlemen.  Some very nice specimens.
315222,Moosebunk,2009-03-09 18:35:00,3970,Don't think there is a steelie river you can't fish Mike.  Good outing guys.
315243,Dozer,2009-03-09 19:22:00,896,"Wowzers!  Nice fish solo, you're the man!  When you writing a book?  Can I buy a copy?"
315362,brkygetr,2009-03-09 23:38:00,425,"  ah, the jig is up...I looked at the map, found the most water with the least roads, and went!!!! Best move I have ever made, except no bows to catch, but thats equalled out by all the water and the bush."
315368,solopaddler,2009-03-09 23:42:00,8605, You're a lucky man.
315417,Ramble,2009-03-10 01:04:00,713,Another solid report. They were beautiful fish fella's nice work.  -Dave
315458,Sinker,2009-03-10 02:14:00,8692,"Nice report and beautiful fish, but seriously, and no offense meant, you need to find a new pose man! You do the same pose with every fish.....LOL........nice job on the launch too i might add  Thanks for the report!!  Sinker"
315478,solopaddler,2009-03-10 02:38:00,8605, I know you're right. Some of those pic's are virtually identical to a few from my Manistee trip when I fished from a boat...
315501,DRIFTER_016,2009-03-10 03:18:00,10439,  I was giving him grief about that this afternoon.  Then he rubbed in the fact that it was -45 up here this morning.
315565,BillM,2009-03-10 11:35:00,17367,I'll make sure to get Mike to pose differently the next time we're out!!! lol
315606,Zubris21,2009-03-10 14:15:00,563,Looks like you guys had a blast!  thanks for sharing!
314853,solopaddler,2009-03-08 17:42:00,8605,"Met up with Bill (BillM on the board) on Saturday for a day of steelheading on one of my favourite north Huron rivers. The river is hard to access in its lower reaches, wide, deep and somewhat featureless. This makes fishing from a boat a huge advantage and that was our game plan utilizing Billy's 15' Legend. Would the boat launch be usable and the river free of ice? We really had no idea, driving the 3 hours up there and taking our chances was the only option.  Upon arrival it was a good news bad news scenario. On the plus side the river was wide open and looked prime. On the downside the ramp was still partially snow covered and blocked in with a sizable snow bank compliments of the road plow.  Still Bill gave it a shot, and although we did get the truck stuck for a short while perseverance prevailed and we finally launched and loaded the boat.          With zero wind we first cruised out to the lake to see if we could connect with some pods of staging fish. Pack ice halted our progress not too far out, but man did it look good!    Alas there was nothing happening at the lake so we began the task of slowly and thoroughly working our way up the river, anchoring just above likely looking seams and drifting our offerings down to the fish.  We didn't get a ton of fish yesterday, but there's definitely something to be said for quality over quantity. All the fish were bright chrome and a couple were absolute tanks putting up long and drawn out battles.  I'll let the photos speak for themselves:                                Several other fish were hooked, fought and lost, including one that felt absolutely huge (never even got a glimpse of it).  We had planned on staying overnight, but the river was rising from snowmelt throughout the day and was pretty much trashed by the time we left.  Not complaining though, what a fantastic day!!  Cheers,  Mike"
314864,b2kptbo,2009-03-08 18:00:00,1505,"Certainly was well worth the effort, good on ya's..."
314868,Cookslav,2009-03-08 18:09:00,1457,"Nice job,  Some quality fish there for sure and I can't think of a better way to spend a Balmy March afternoon. In retrospect I Shoulda tried that myself....dang!  Cheers,"
314878,irishfield,2009-03-08 18:35:00,26272,My F150 would have backed my boat in there one shot Bill ! lol  Some nice fish there fellas!
314882,trapshooter,2009-03-08 19:14:00,1234,"Beautiful chrome gentlemen.  As far as I can tell, steelhead and wild turkeys are the only things missing from Sioux Lookout."
314886,BillM,2009-03-08 19:24:00,17367," hahaha!!!  Those pics make that bank look really small.  I never though I'd highside my oldmans 2500HD Duramax but I did it yesterday.  The ramp itself was great,  but the snowplows made a nice little obstacle over the winter.   A bit of digging later and all the weight was over the wheels and not the front skidplate, lol.  It sure was fun to lay the hammer down in 4LO and displace some snow.  Good day for sure, not a huge number of fish, but man were they ever pretty!!   Mike put a clinic on today on how to read water.  Luckily I paid attention..  Thanks again Mike!  till next time bud"
314887,yo_guy,2009-03-08 19:30:00,111, Nice chrome fellas...
314898,Spiel,2009-03-08 20:09:00,9065,"Hmmmmm, perhaps it's time to get my boat out, been some time since I wet a line there.  Nice work guys."

314960,Scott S,2009-03-08 22:52:00,203,Nice fish fellas. That's my old stomping ground were you were. We use to drive the boat up onto the ice and fish under the ice! The last cottage on the left heading out to the lake has a real nice deep hole right up to the bend. Man I got to make some arangements and get up there. Scooter
314961,camillj,2009-03-08 22:57:00,1988,Sweet !
315005,brkygetr,2009-03-09 01:16:00,425,  Ah...the mighty Bruce... that cedar tree has produced a LOT of fish...LOL. Every time I see pics of back home makes me miss bouncin the bottom!!! Well done. Also my favourite river.

315085,solopaddler,2009-03-09 11:48:00,8605,"  Yep, the same spots continue to produce year after year, the old river doesn't change much.  How'd you find yourself moving to N/W Ontario? That's a move I'd love to make myself."
315099,highdrifter,2009-03-09 12:56:00,2534,"AH that shoulda been me!!  Beauty trouts boyz.  Well worth the distance travelled...  All my creeks were blown, save one unexpected little nook!!  Good fun, Mike and Bill.  cheers HD"
