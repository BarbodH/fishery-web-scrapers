How frustrating...  Still going to make the drive up to the cottage and hope this passes by the afternoon.  As a side note, my daughter was in a battle of the bands last night and they totally rocked! They wont find out until Monday what the results are. But were immediately offered a paid gig sometime later in the year! The kids are all 14-15yrs old, but man, can they play.  All said, great night last night, crappy morning. Lets see how the rest of the weekend plays out..."
