On my way home last week I stopped to get gas in grimsby, happened to see a sign for grimsby tackle and thought no one's expecting me homeyet-may as well check it out. Was not disappointed - great selection, fair prices and the staff was very helpful.  One of the younger guys saw me looking at swim baits (for our upcoming Brennan Harbour trip, based on this month's in fisherman   . He offered tips, thoughts etc but not pushy at all just helpful.  Even pulled me over to show me his go to multi species killer bait for the Grand  Anyway great shop-will be stopping there for gas a lot my more on the way home from golf. Cheers Gordy"
