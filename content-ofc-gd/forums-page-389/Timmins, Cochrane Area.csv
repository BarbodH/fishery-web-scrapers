I've taken several Manitoba/NWT/northern Quebec trips, but they are awful expensive. So, I've started to look at some other and somewhat closer lodges. Last year I went to Fireside Lodge on Little Vermillion Lake in August, and had great fishing.  This year, I'm thinking about an August trip to the Timmins/Cochrane area, and am looking for some recommendations. I'd appreciate any thoughts from the group."

Mattagami lake is another good lake but it is closer to gogama than Timmins, Miniakwa lodge is a good place to stay also. And another lake would be horwood lake, probably one of the best lakes in the north. All the lakes have great fishing and you will have a blast here in the north"
