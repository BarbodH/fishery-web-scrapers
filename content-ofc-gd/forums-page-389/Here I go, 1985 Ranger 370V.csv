711905,RangerGuy,2012-07-05 14:34:00,564,"WOW! Great Job!... You now have one of the toughest/best looking boats on the water  My last boat was a 1989 Ranger Fisherman Tiller.. So pretty much the same vintage.  I think I read somewhere you were concerned with the transom. DON'T BE! Here's why..  I was rear ended a couple weeks after buying my Ranger Fisherman. The goof hit me while I was stopped at a red light with a full size GM Pickup. Yes he was talking on a cell phone!  Anyways, he literally pushed me and the boat 1/2 way through the intersection. The hit took 2 blades off the prop, crushed my transom support bar and that's it.  I had no pressure cracks or anything in my transom , I had the boat & motor inspected at a marine repair shop just to be safe.  Great job man! Enjoy"
711923,kickingfrog,2012-07-05 15:08:00,8333,Not sure how I missed this either. Lots of hard work and persistence. Sweet ride that is a lot of fun.

711993,bubbles,2012-07-05 20:29:00,591,"I missed this completely as well.  Great job, I love how negative people were and you proved them wring, I love a challenge and can completely appreciate the satisfaction of doing the job yourself.  Well Done!"
510966,SRT8 smoker craft,2010-10-11 02:52:00,1107, Judging from the olmost new motor hangin off the back I'd say pretty good.

510996,Handlebarz,2010-10-11 10:38:00,3790,great work on the resto that boat looks like you should have many great days out on the water with her. always nice to read reports like this and see other members helping out.  I have a question about your hammer how many people make fun of you for using that to build a wood casting deck? I know my buddies here laugh at me well at least they look at me like I am nuts when I pass my big hammer over when they ask for one. Its nice to see that I am not the only one why uses one for making things fit.

I'm thinking that other than the motor it really didn't matter what shape everything was in, you would have gutted it anyway. Great result. I wish I'd contributed ssomething but mayhap you'll still let me on it.  JF"

The project was not done to make money, because if I add up the hours that I put into it, i would be lucky to realize $5/hour. What I did get, is the satisfaction of a job reasonably done. I would not be able to put a value on it, as I do not have the training to survey a boat. I will have to get that done for insurance though...."

You seemed to have made some friends along the way, and created that terrific opportunity.  The experience that you gain during a project like this sets you aside from most of us boat owners who just try to maintain a tidy boat.  It takes a lot of mental endurance to keep up and overtake the work.  I'm sure you can go back to the first day that you took a step back from its original state, and remember when you doubted yourself ... as others did.  Now look!  That's priceless!"

434208,aniceguy,2010-02-17 13:52:00,1094, Usually I would agree but a total restoration to a bass boat is like a car these days...take apeek at these HTHM its inspirational for sure  http://bbcboards.zeroforum.com/zerothread/...tera-ii-project
434228,CLofchik,2010-02-17 14:53:00,854," You're confusing two different hull problems.  Osmosis (water blistering) and a moisture meter is only something you need to worry about if the hull is constantly submersed for long periods, like a sailboat.  Aniceguy was talking about the wooden structure rotting, in your hull there's a lattice work of wood ribs.  The glass itself can be fine, but if water is left in the bilge for awhile those will rot out, and if they're done so is your hull.  You'd be doing body work on a car with a rotten frame.   I'll leave the hull crack for somebody else..."
434478,ecmilley,2010-02-18 14:17:00,2163,"Hirk helped my with my 363 ranger and is worth talking to on any issues, bbc boards have some very skilled people into restorations bookmark that site! Any help with your livewells bilges ect and electrical issues shoot me a pm have done most of these issues on my ranger already and there pretty straightfoward"
434535,Uncle Buck,2010-02-18 18:56:00,1000,bummer...  factor cost and time required to do the work. then factor in how much fishing time you'll lose and you'll see it's not worth it...  buy something that is water ready...  although no boat is ever water ready... sonar/downriggers/rodholders/etc....  you'll be much happier that way in the end...  here's what i opened up and found on my boat...      in 5 years it seen water once and still isn't ready...  it's a long/slow process and to do it right will cost you $$  my advice put it back together as is and get rid of it ASAP
434563,aplumma,2010-02-18 21:06:00,6896,You can price out the needed material to do the jobs and then the labor you can't do yourself. Add 30% to the number and then you will have an idea if you want to proceed. Most rebuilds of a mechanical nature exceed the resale value of the original item. If this is not the perfect boat for you and does not have sentimental value and the rebuild is not enjoyable then you might decide to look for a different donor.   Art
434564,Gerritt,2010-02-18 21:09:00,6129,Albert did you not just purchase this boat? did you not check it out before forking over the $$? Looks like you have ALOT of work ahead of you brother. Hope you did not put out too much for it.  I wish you all the best..  G.
434567,JohnF,2010-02-18 21:36:00,3494,"Sometimes these restoration jobs are about the fun, the satisfaction of resurrecting something nice. The nicest sled I ever had was also one of the slowest and took the most work. It was a '70 292 Blizzard that I reconstructed after a few years hard track years. It was my favourite of all the sleds I owned, I think mainly because of the work I put into it. And any of you who've done frame up car builds understand the feeling. I helped put a '28 Chev body on a Ford frame with a 283 driveline. It took us all winter and a lot of work but were we ever proud of it.  I think that if we only look at the dollars we'd just buy what we want but what fun is that?  JF"

When I look at the condition of this boat I would swear it had been sunk. I would spend the time and do it properly. Remember to take lots of pictures as you're stripping it so you know what goes where when you go to reassemble it. Also label all the parts you take off, again to make it easier when you go to put it all back together. It's going to take a lot of time and effort to bring it back to it's former glory, but at least it will keep you out of trouble!!!"

510950,HTHM,2010-10-11 01:29:00,4082,"Back on January 1 2010, I finally fulfilled a lifelong dream. To get a go-fast fishing boat. As I did not have a passport, my wife went over the border to pick it up, I waited by Sarnia customs office for her to arrive and when she did, I said to myself, Oh feces. It was too late, the deal was done, and as my mother would say, sometimes you just have to row with the oars you've got. We pulled it home, and here is where the fun started, I went to back it into the shop, and it turned out that my door measured 89"" and the boat measures 93"". That delayed the work until I installed another roll-up door in the shop. A month passed before I found a door at a price I could afford, (free), and installed it. First job, thorough inspection of the hull, I found this:  And this:  And this:  And when that was not enough, I found this:  Ok, so I have some fibreglass work to do. On to the engine, which the seller assured me was fine. I expected to do some work to the hull, but the motor was OK. My brother came over and we fired it up, started no problem, and ran great, on FIVE out of the SIX cylinders. Pulled the heads and this is what I found:   The inside of the head:  The cylinder and piston:  This was starting to turn into a big job. Well, the way to get big jobs done is the same way a small job gets done, one step at a time. The first step, strip the interior and carpet. Then de-rig the hull. That was done by others, as I had made a deal for another motor, much newer, much nicer. More on that later. Then I had to flip the hull, I took it off the trailer using the tried and true, tie 'er to a tree and pull the trailer out from under method. To flip it I was stumped, until we finally just flipped it over with 6 men and a lot of care.  Then came the fibreglass repair, grind out the poor work, lay resin and roving, lay mat and resin, grind to shape, apply fairing compound, and sand, and sand, and sand, and sand, and sand, and sand, and sand, and when that is done, more sanding. I was using a 5"" random orbit sander that is meant for finishing wood.     There is not one square inch of that hull that has not been rubbed by my hands at least four times. I have to say that at this point I was getting a bit overwhelmed, and Dan Bouck came over to help for a night. We did not get a lot done, but we established a friendship, and I was encouraged to carry on. The next week, I bought a large compressor off of Kijiji, and an air sander that is meant for bodywork. What a difference!  Well all of the sanding on the bottom of the hull was finally done, and I called my older brother to come by and spray it. He came by, and we had to sand, and sand, and sand, and sand, and sand, and sand, and sand, and sand, and sand, and sand, and sand, until it was up to his standards. I glad we did. However, twenty minutes after the paint flashed over, it rained! This caused a series of craters in the paint that was applied, so after it dried, I had to sand, and sand, and sand, and sand, and sand, and sand, and sand, and sand, and sand, and sand, and sand, and sand, and sand, and sand, and sand, and sand, in order to get the hull ready again. Once again, he came over and sprayed the hull.           Finished:    The weather cooperated, the paint cured for four days, six guys came over and we flipped the hull right side up. With incredible care! Now, to get it in the trailer…..The bow eye having been reinstalled, and tightened very well……OH THE TRAILER!  While I was working on the bottom of the boat, I also redid the trailer. The fibreglass fenders had been shredded by a blowout, and the lights did not work very well. Also, the paint looked like crap, the carpet needed to be replaced on the bunks, the tongue jack was on the side rail causing the rail to twist, and the bearings were shot. I took the fenders off and had them re-done at a local fibreglass shop, faired the repairs, and then I had to sand, and sand, and sand, and sand, and sand, and sand, and sand, and sand, and sand, and sand, and sand, them until they were ready for paint. They were painted at the same time as the hull. Then the frame was wire brushed with a wire wheel on a grinder, (note to self – remove lighting wire before wire brushing or you may get your grinder caught up in the wire and ruin your grinder…), sprayed with tremclad, and the bunks wrapped with carpet and re-installed. The bearings, I had to have help with, Vinnimon came over and helped me with that. I was not sure what I needed and he took one look, ran to the parts store and had them done in a jiffy. Thanks again! Now back to the narrative…. Being nervous about ruining the paint and having to sand, and sand, and sand, and sand, and sand, and sand, and sand, and sand, and sand, and sand, and sand, and sand, and sand, and sand again, I decided to pull the trailer under the boat rather than pull the boat on the trailer. Dry carpet??????not with our happy lube, dish soap. It slid under lickety split! Well, now I have a nice hull, but a unpleasant top cap, so guess what needs to be done to the top cap? You guessed it I had to sand, and sand, and sand, and sand, and sand, and sand, and sand, and sand, and sand, and sand, and sand, and sand, and sand, and sand, and sand, and sand, and sand, and sand, and sand, and sand, and sand, and sand, and sand, and sand, and sand, and sand, and sand, and sand, and sand, and sand, and sand, and sand, and sand, and the sand some more! There was more sanding and fairing involved with the top cap than with the hull. Off to the paint shop, (no rain on this one), three coats of primer, HAND sanded between coats, and it was ready for paint. I gave my brother complete freedom in the paint and striping details so I was not around to tell that story, however I heard it involved a 3 am finish time….. Then it was time to build the deck extension, pics will speak for me:        Now for re-assembly, make a new dash panel, install the mechanicals, and look at the wiring. I looked at the wiring, threw up my hands in holy horror and took the TV route.    I phoned a friend. Dan Bouck, saddled up his white stallion, and came riding to the rescue. He took a full Saturday to help me out with the wiring, and when he left, everything was working fine.  That day would be another post on its' own. Time for the carpet, it went in a lot easier than I though it would. A lot like doing sod, but your cutting errors do not grow in, they stay and you only lay one roll to prevent seams.    Finally ready for the motor. I had made a deal for a 2004 Optimax, 150 HP where I paid $ X for the motor and traded the blown Yamaha for rigging. The motor portion of this [project is still being worked out so I will remain silent on that for now. So it has gone from this:   To this: "

433139,DRIFTER_016,2010-02-14 05:03:00,10439,"  Shifter should be held on with 2 or 3 bolts. Reach in behind the gunnel and you should be able to get at them.  As for the helm, this is what I did with the helm on my Fisher SV-18 GT.  Before    After      The Bow panel is for the trolling motor and there may be an outboard tilt switch there."
433150,Terry,2010-02-14 11:29:00,14456,the bow controls left is for the trolling motor you can plug in a charger so you switch to charge up down is trim tilt for the main motor manual/auto is for the front livewell and  the last ones are lights

I pulled the bow controls out to see what was going on there and also to access the bow hook bolt. It is a little loose. When I pulled it out here is what I found.  cut wires on the run and charge switch... CAn these be restored and or used to control an aftermarket on-board charger?

434034,HTHM,2010-02-16 23:31:00,4082,Apparently there is a way of checking the transom for rot with a multimeter something to do with the conductivity of water. I have taken the motor and reefed on it with no flex seen. However I was by myself and may not of had the best perspective to check as I worked it. Does anyone here know the multimeter procedure?
434040,greenfshrmn,2010-02-16 23:52:00,65,"Hi HTHM, I don't want to sound pessimistic here but I would be concerned about that crack in front of the pad.  All the carpet, wiring etc  is straight forward to repair.  However, I learned the hard way that it is very difficult to repair cracks in gel coat and not have them return soon again afterwards.  That one on the pad looks like it even has rust coming through it from the interior."
434042,greenfshrmn,2010-02-17 00:03:00,65,"Hi HTHM, carpets, wiring, even gel coat chips etc can be relatively straight-forward to repair, but I would be very concerned about that crack in the hull ahead of the pad.  I learned the hard way that it is very difficult to repair cracks and not have them return again soon afterwards.  That crack in the hull looks really bad and even seems to have rust showing through it from the insides, which makes me wonder how long the boat was in the water allowing the fibreglass to soak up the water.  You also haven't mentioned about the work required on the motor, steering cables, steering helm etc.  They are all very expensive parts.  Personally I would be looking for another project.  I don't doubt that you have the determination to get it done, I just wonder if you will see the rewards at the end.  Best of luck."

434069,danbouck,2010-02-17 01:06:00,4380,"I don't think it's anything that you can't handle and like aniceguy stated, put $3000 into her and you'll have a sweet ride!"
434075,aniceguy,2010-02-17 01:20:00,1094,put another 1000 in beer and I ll come help
434076,hirk,2010-02-17 01:22:00,571,"Albert as much as you want a nice setup,if it was mine I'd be looking at taking care of the basics like carpet,seats,wiring, steering cable,GC seals and do the glass work myself (don't worry about it being factory perfect) while spending as little as possible (under 1k for above if do it yourself) and enjoy the boat.It's not worth putting anymore into it as your investment would far exceed it's value when done.Just use it till the bugs bites for a bigger boat cause it will lol."
434077,danbouck,2010-02-17 01:23:00,4380,I'll help for 2 beers/hr
434099,HTHM,2010-02-17 02:07:00,4082,"Mechanically the boat is fine, except for the lower unit seals. Steering is excellent, I do not know about the wiring yet, but I am confident it will be relatively easy to toubleshoot if there is a problem. The glass work will be done to the best of my ability, heck if I can tape drywall, I should be able to smooth fiberglass. Only trouble is getting the boat upside down. Good thing my neighbour has a mini ex and a skidsteer. The seats I am going to get done by a local shop, depending on the cost."
