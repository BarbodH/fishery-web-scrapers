I'm really thinking about dropping the cash on the Oregon, but I'm a bit worried about spending almost as much on maps.  I've seen some of the Ibycus maps, but I've heard there might be torrents with what I'm looking for. PM's readily accepted!"

It's a little pain to download the map because of the use of torrents, so there is some hoops to jump through. The reason he doesn't offer a direct file download is because the file is huge (2-3GB) and his server can't handle it.  You could also buy the maps from ibycus in DVD form for $25. Still a lot cheaper than $99 from garmin."
