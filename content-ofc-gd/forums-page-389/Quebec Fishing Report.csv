I know it's the Ontario Fishing Community but I figured I'd toss out a little report on a week spent at Lake Kipawa just across the border near North Bay.  This is our second year going to Kipawa (my wife and I) so we're still exploring a lot - the winds were up most of the week so we had to explore lots of new water.  Luckily the hosts (3 seasons camp) and other guests were great sources of info.  Anyhow, we had a great time and ate plenty of fish and of course got to meet the locals:   Untitled by Sean Maurik, on Flickr  Here's my notes and a few photos:  Saturday: water temp was about 78 and we spent the afternoon swimming in a nice rocky bay, didn't really do any serious fishing  JIMG_0105 by Sean Maurik, on Flickr  Sunday I went out and fished mid lake humps which worked but a storm blew up in the afternoon so it was movie night (ipads are great)  Monday was more trolling around the humps, brought up a nice sucker  <object type=""application/x-shockwave-flash"" width=""640"" height=""480"" data=""http://www.flickr.com/apps/video/stewart.swf?v=109786""'>http://www.flickr.com/apps/video/stewart.swf?v=109786""'>http://www.flickr.com/apps/video/stewart.swf?v=109786""'>http://www.flickr.com/apps/video/stewart.swf?v=109786"" classid=""clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000""> <param name=""flashvars"" value=""intl_lang=en-us&photo_secret=0ec7d674b3&photo_id=7480457648&hd_default=false""></param> <param name=""movie"" value=""http://www.flickr.com/apps/video/stewart.swf?v=109786""></param>'>http://www.flickr.com/apps/video/stewart.swf?v=109786""></param> <param name=""bgcolor"" value=""#000000""></param> <param name=""allowFullScreen"" value=""true""></param><embed type=""application/x-shockwave-flash"" src=""http://www.flickr.com/apps/video/stewart.swf?v=109786"" bgcolor=""#000000"" allowfullscreen=""true"" flashvars=""intl_lang=en-us&photo_secret=0ec7d674b3&photo_id=7480457648&hd_default=false"" height=""480"" width=""640""></embed></object>  In the afternoon we trolled shorelines  and of course pike where out and about  JIMG_0132 by Sean Maurik, on Flickr  During the evening Julia decided to show me how it was done jigging up a nice 'eye then picking up another trolling a blue chrome taildancer:  JIMG_0140 by Sean Maurik, on Flickr   JIMG_0153 by Sean Maurik, on Flickr  Monday was also the first fish fry night:  JIMG_0157 by Sean Maurik, on Flickr   Tuesday was a lazy windy day with Julia landing another nice one but we didn't stay out much - the mosquitos really came after us with a vengeance for some reason.  Wednesday I spent mostly targetting bass.  Had a monster on with the video camera filming when the net got stuck (I'd lost another large one earlier so this time I wanted to be sure and use the net). I'm sure we can all relate:  <object type=""application/x-shockwave-flash"" width=""640"" height=""480"" data=""http://www.flickr.com/apps/video/stewart.swf?v=109786"" classid=""clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000""> <param name=""flashvars"" value=""intl_lang=en-us&photo_secret=60d088ff08&photo_id=7480784094&hd_default=false""></param> <param name=""movie"" value=""http://www.flickr.com/apps/video/stewart.swf?v=109786""></param> <param name=""bgcolor"" value=""#000000""></param> <param name=""allowFullScreen"" value=""true""></param><embed type=""application/x-shockwave-flash"" src=""http://www.flickr.com/apps/video/stewart.swf?v=109786"" bgcolor=""#000000"" allowfullscreen=""true"" flashvars=""intl_lang=en-us&photo_secret=60d088ff08&photo_id=7480784094&hd_default=false"" height=""480"" width=""640""></embed></object>  We spent the evening jigging and did quite well with lots of boats hanging out, a great evening was had by all.  Thursday we went to one of the back lakes hunting for large pike but didn't do too well, did get quite a start when this guy actually crawled up my shirt and got onto my shoulder  Dock Spider by Sean Maurik, on Flickr  Julia did get to hold her first pike though - it was a monster  JIMG_0202 by Sean Maurik, on Flickr  Jigging during the evening in the same spot in Wednesday turned up lots of fish but the size was way down - only one keeper.  Friday I worked shorelines and rock piles for bass again but instead got this guy - he hit my spinner bait in 7' of water  Untitled by Sean Maurik, on Flickr  Anyhow - For the full slide show with lots of scenery shots go here (sorry, can't embed it into the post: http://www.flickr.com//photos/emosworld/sets/72157630372863320/show/."
