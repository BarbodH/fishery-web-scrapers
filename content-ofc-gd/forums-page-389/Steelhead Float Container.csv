712033,Sharkbait22,2012-07-06 00:05:00,297,What are folks using to hold their floats?  Last spring my floats took-on some damage. I was thinking of using some kind of hard sided container BUT I don't want something bulky if possible.  I like to go light on tackle. Thanks

712099,SRT8 smoker craft,2012-07-06 03:23:00,1107,I use a old tylenol bottle one of the big ones real tough and a nice wide opening to get them out from but I pretty much only use drennan slip floats so they are fairly small
712109,Twocoda,2012-07-06 06:03:00,4130,i normally keep mine just outta reach in the heaviest current...not the greatest method i know because ya have to wait for the water levels to drop to switch em up
712118,Ron,2012-07-06 10:04:00,1683,"I use a hard case for prescription glasses. Can easily fit a dozen in there, all sizes."
712159,Ralph Field,2012-07-06 13:05:00,1018,"I use a plastic food container that holds about 20 floats and fits my inside pocket of my vest. I likely never use more than 2 or 3 floats in a day, so I cannot give you a reason for carrying 20."
712355,Sharkbait22,2012-07-06 22:06:00,297, Best idea I've heard. Thank you.
