711023,hoby5,2012-07-03 00:54:00,42,"Hello all,   Ive been doing alot of research lately on which 60hp tiller motor ill be buying new next year but have not been able to find a good comparison thats 2012-2013 models. I have found alot of comps of 50hp but they are from 2008-2009-2010 would like some perspective on which models offers the best Tiller options.   thanks"
711034,RangerGuy,2012-07-03 01:35:00,564,When I was shopping around I liked the merc big tiller handle and Yamaha tiller handle.  I choose Yamaha I didn't like that merc wanted to charge for variable troll on top of the cost of the tiller arm.  I got 6 hours on my 75 Tiller and I am very pleased. I'm comin from a 89 60 Johnson 2stroke tiller. So not a fair comparison really.
711403,hoby5,2012-07-04 00:32:00,42,"Thanks RangerGuy,    ive been leaning towards the yammy 60 four stroke as well just because off the control options on the big tiller handle. Still not 100% sure which ill go with hoping a comp comes out that is more recent to help me finally nail down my decision."
711485,Sinker,2012-07-04 02:52:00,8692,"My next tiller is going to be a yammy, hands down.  I don't have a 60hp for comparison though....  S."
711488,Steve,2012-07-04 03:05:00,2075,are you looking for any specific information?  i run the yamaha 60hp tiller.  currently about 2000 hours on it.  2009 model.
712037,hoby5,2012-07-06 00:13:00,42, Yea im looking for general insight as to the pros and cons of owning diff models that are available on the market. Performance and durabillity mainly.
712102,bigcreekdad,2012-07-06 03:44:00,546,"[  I had a Yamaha 50 tiller 4 stroke for 10 years....flawless. Traded it 3 years ago for a 60 tiller 4 stroke.....flawless, and increased my top speed from 29 mph to 35 easily. I also think, but cannot prove, my mpg have not changed. Although this is likely my last motor, if I bought again, I'd buy a Yamaha with no hesitation.

712152,Raf,2012-07-06 12:44:00,3495, I think you'll find they are all pretty close.  The merc guys love their motors and I love my Yamaha.  It may come down to best deal and closest dealer.
712181,Mike the Pike,2012-07-06 13:58:00,3421,    I have the Yamaha 60HP Tiller bought new in 2009.At first I put my older 50HP Honda on this boat and I was dissapointed with the performance so one year later I upgraded to the Yamaha.  The Yamaha comes standard with the RPM control to troll down slower.I think it may be an option on a Merc.  Buy the Yamaha you will be pleased with the performance and reliability.  All the Yamaha owners on this board have great satisfaction from their outboards.  Good Luck with your purchase!!!  mtp
