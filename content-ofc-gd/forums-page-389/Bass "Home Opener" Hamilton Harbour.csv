709200,solopaddler,2012-06-25 22:54:00,8605,Cool report.  I've lived in and around Hamilton my entire life and have never once fished the harbour. I'll have to throw a canoe in there and give it a shot.
709228,dave524,2012-06-26 00:24:00,4508,nicely done   those are pretty respectable largemouth
709291,Christopheraaron,2012-06-26 02:58:00,3525,"""smallish""? Those are some nice fish!"
709294,cwpres,2012-06-26 03:12:00,14,"Wow, nice job!  Got to get my kayak out there!"
709295,Christopheraaron,2012-06-26 03:17:00,3525,"I just saw it, but has Brian seen this yet? If he has expect him to be at the harbor tomorrow with a net, boiling water and turtle bait."
709298,stasbrute,2012-06-26 03:21:00,206,Sorry a few were biggish.....
709337,Joeytier,2012-06-26 12:19:00,3990,"Man, there is some nasty slimy slop in that harbour.  Good job on making the most of it"
709548,Snidley,2012-06-26 22:17:00,620,Sheepieville. Bass are not the main target in Hamilton Harbour
709605,smally21,2012-06-27 01:18:00,993,ive never caught sheep in the harbour. hundreds of bass though.
709625,Snidley,2012-06-27 02:05:00,620,The Bass are 2-3lb. The Sheepies are 10-13lbs. Big difference. They really pull and you actually sacrifice some gear to get them.
709630,Christopheraaron,2012-06-27 02:08:00,3525, ya 200 bass in the whole harbour.
709651,solopaddler,2012-06-27 02:35:00,8605,If I launch my canoe in there will the gel coat melt off?  Just wondering.
709715,Aaron Shirley,2012-06-27 12:16:00,655,Cool report. Can't beat trips so close to home
712617,redpearl99,2012-07-08 00:21:00,259,are there any particular good spots for shore fishing the harbour? I've never gone and would love to take my girlfriend (she just caught her first fish yesterday)
