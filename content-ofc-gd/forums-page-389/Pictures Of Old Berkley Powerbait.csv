712049,MCTFisher9120,2012-07-06 00:44:00,3761,"So I got this sample worm bag with a few packages of powerbait from what looks to be a long time ago. The plastics are in great shape and I just wanted to share some pictures of these old age plastics. Really is neat to see some old stuff. I was hoping to get a idea of when these plastics might of been made?   The Binder with the pack's inside   The individual packs.   Power Tubes   Power Worms   One of the Walleye Rig packs   Power Shad   And the power grubs   Is there any value to these? I don't need to use them on the water but will use the binder, the shads and these walleye rigs look interesting. Going to try and search some, heck I might have a a bunch of collectibles here   Tightlines  MTBF"
712061,EC1,2012-07-06 01:12:00,930,"Don't know if you've got anything of too much value, but it is pretty cool to see the old packaging! I believe seeing one of those bags at my house before.  Come to think about it though, I don't think powerbait has changed their formula in a long long time... They still smell the same!  Have fun with them Mike!"
712068,krixxer,2012-07-06 01:24:00,274,I'd guess 90's  I remember the stuff from CT.
712075,Roy,2012-07-06 02:01:00,13728,The oldest it could be is 1988. That's when it hit the market. Pretty worthless I'd say.  Edited to add: It appears to be a kit that Pure Fishing would have given to stores and reps to try out and pass along to guides and pros and such.
712078,MCTFisher9120,2012-07-06 02:11:00,3761,"Neat to know guys, thanks for the info. I couldn't find much for pictures online of these packs. The shads look like they would work well"
712084,kickingfrog,2012-07-06 02:23:00,8333,Thanks for making me feel old MTBF.
712086,danc,2012-07-06 02:30:00,4677,I've got some of those welded into the tray of my Old Pal tackle box. Thanks Mike!!
712087,kickingfrog,2012-07-06 02:34:00,8333," Ya those old boxes did not like the ""new age"" plastics. I've still got a few melted boxes somewhere."
712089,craigdritchie,2012-07-06 02:39:00,1586,"Mike those baits are from the mid 90s. Berkley went with the yellow wave pattern (shark teeth?) along the bottom of the label somewhere around 94 or 95, and kept it till about 98 or 99. I have some old fishing magazines from that period and you can see the same label in the ads.  These will all work just fine. May as well use them, since they have basically zero value. They're not collectible, because there's still way too many of them out there.  Baits marked ""Sample"" were normally given free of charge to fishing writers, tournament guys and sponsored pros so they would use them and start hyping the new product. They were marked ""sample"" to discourage unscrupulous people from just selling it. I have a garage full of this stuff. Whenever I got samples I always kept one or two packages in perfect condition, so I could use them as photo props. Still have most of it .... I mean boxes and boxes of stuff now .... so its kind of like my own personal museum.  By the way, if you like old baits, keep an eye out on eBay for old Power Bait Neonz. They were produced around the same time. Man alive, did those baits STINK!!  I have no clue what Berkley put in that stuff but once you got it on your hands you couldn't get it off. I still remember getting the samples in the mail and opening a bag in my office. It almost made my graphic artist puke, and my desk smelled like a dead animal for two weeks. Berkley discontinued the Neonz baits after a short while (likely due to people being afraid to buy the stuff) but they did catch fish."
712090,kickingfrog,2012-07-06 02:44:00,8333,Interesting about the Neonz. Next time I get in that back corner in the basement I'll have to take a look. I don't remember them smelling that bad thoughâ€¦ maybe that's why no one sits near me on the bus?
712192,Garnet,2012-07-06 14:36:00,2056,"Yes late 80's early 90's for the red bags. They smelled much like dog food until they changed them in middle 90's caught a ton of bass on 7"" and 10"" worms still have some."
712341,MCTFisher9120,2012-07-06 21:30:00,3761,I hate to use them but am not happy they are not worth much moola. I looked for those Power Shad's and couldn't seem to find info on them. The rest of the baits are still out today I believe.  All in all it's nice to take a step back and see some older gear.
712361,kickingfrog,2012-07-06 22:27:00,8333," Geezzzze, I've got a cell phone that's older then that stuff Mike."
712364,bare foot wader,2012-07-06 22:31:00,1354," those power shads got me hooked on bass fishing, deadly on a gravel pit i grew up fishing...i'll buy that bag off you for 10 bucks, sentimental value lol"
712366,Gerritt,2012-07-06 22:40:00,6129,  Welcome to the club... I still have my old bag phone... and the first flip phone.... what a monster. just gotta remember where they are for old times sake...   G
712405,Kerry,2012-07-07 02:32:00,383,Yep! I still got a bunch of those gold/black power shads. Great for rock smallies on a black 3/16 oz jig head with the larger hook. Kerry
