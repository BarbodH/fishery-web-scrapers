711868,taper,2012-07-05 11:59:00,611,Just wondering what a pair of Cannon mini mag electric down riggers would be worth. These are the older white bodied units. They have cable a pair of balls and swivel bases. Both work fine. Any one have an idea on what they are worth?
711869,Christopheraaron,2012-07-05 12:05:00,3525,If they're going to the classifieds I'll say $25 for the 2.

711877,Pikeslayer,2012-07-05 12:35:00,1443, If you go to spoonpullers.com and search 'cannon mini mag' you will find some older listings. Quickly looked @ 3 listings dating back to 2010. They were priced anywhere from 100 to 175 each depending on age/condition. No idea what they actually sold for but I'm pretty confident that there was a there was probably a $25+ haggling factor built in.  Slayer
711927,taper,2012-07-05 15:17:00,611,Billy bob what part are you referring to when you asked aluminum or lexon?
711981,Billy Bob,2012-07-05 19:33:00,5865,The main frame......older one's are aluminium....then Cannon went to Lexon....and now I believe even the booms are not metal..
712303,taper,2012-07-06 19:39:00,611,Billy bob I was going to say aluminum but I went out and checked and they are a white plastic of some sort so I would say the lexon you are talking about. The booms are metal. I did notice they say Mini mag A on the side.
712308,Billy Bob,2012-07-06 19:49:00,5865,"I not sure if your selling or buying them......since they are the ""MINI MAG"" and not Cannon MAG 10 or even a MAG 5.....I would say $200 at the most.  Bob"
712421,NANUK,2012-07-07 04:34:00,797,"I sold a pair of those older mini mags last year for $370, they didn't have swivel bases."
712422,Sinker,2012-07-07 05:03:00,8692,"A buddy of mine bought a pair about a month ago, just like yours, for $200. Cables, swivel mounts, cannonballs, releases, and power wires included.  We haven't installed them yet, so can't say how well they work.  S."
