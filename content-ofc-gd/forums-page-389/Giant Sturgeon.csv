712091,SirCranksalot,2012-07-06 02:48:00,3291,"Here's a pic someone sent me.   This Sturgeon was caught on the LAKE OF THE WOODS , KENORA , ONTARIO two weeks ago. It weighed out at over 1,000 lbs (463.6 kg) and measured out at 11'1"" (3.3563 meters). It was 56"" around the girth and took over 6 and a half hours, and 4 dozen beers, for the 4 guys taking turns at reeling it in.  Any Sturgeon OVER about five feet has to be released unharmed and cannot be removed from the water.  They are brood / breeding stock and probably older than most of us. "
712092,uglyfish,2012-07-06 02:50:00,981,"im gonna go on a limb and say no... not caught on lake of the woods. looks like a white sturgeon to me, which doesnt reside in lake of the woods. that would be from BC on the fraser river most likely. gorgeous fish though"
712093,danc,2012-07-06 02:51:00,4677,Lake of the Woods and every other lake on the planet.
712094,hooked!,2012-07-06 02:55:00,38,That pic is a few years old - I believe it is from British Columbia.  A great pic none-the-less!
712097,Dutch,2012-07-06 03:06:00,831,BC Fish - Fraser River if I recall correctly.  Gorgeous fish.  Pic has been floating around since the early 2000's.  Cue the pic of the huge pike that's been caught on almost every lake that holds pike in the last 5 years.....
712098,manitoubass2,2012-07-06 03:19:00,11391,"the sturgeon in our chain are not white sturgeon, and they only get to about 7ft, and around 100lbs giver take. And most the sturgeon reside in the river, not in Rainy Lake or LOTW, although you can still incidentally catch them.  and size doesnt matter as far as I know??? None of them can be removed from the water nor can you target them, its closed all season"
