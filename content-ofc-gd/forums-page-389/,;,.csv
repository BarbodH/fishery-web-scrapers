712401,mike rousseau,2012-07-07 01:59:00,4661, Very cool...  I didn't LAND my first musky till I was 18...  But it's a bit easier to find information nowadays.... Learn new techniques... Etc... And it's turning out some great anglers like yourself...  Heck  We didn't even have Internet at our house growing up....
