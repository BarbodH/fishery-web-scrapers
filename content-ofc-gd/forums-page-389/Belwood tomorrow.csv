We usually fish from a boat, but since the water levels are probably low and there are lots of hazards in that lake we will be fishing from shore.  Where would the best spot be to fish in the reservoir? I'd assume from the dam but there is all rock down that side and it looks hard to get down.  Since it is so warm would it even be worth my time trying for brown trout in the river below the dam?   Thanks in advance  - Matt"
