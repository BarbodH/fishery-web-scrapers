I told him it's pretty much all private land except for that spot with the tiny beach and canoe house and there ain't room to bbq.  So is it illegal to BBQ outside on public lands without a permit?  Most city parks (like Erindale Park) and conservation areas require a permit that could be from $50 to over $100 from what I understand and also require you to pay the gate fee too if it's a conservation area for instance. And not only that but I'm guessing that most city parks at least are booked up weeks in advance. Not sure about conservation areas.  Anyone have any experience with any spots where's it's cheap to book and might be available on 1 or 2 days notice? Or better yet, that is free, if that's even possible?  Not the Bluffs and not Milne Dam in Markham.  Thanks for any suggestions. I'll pass them along."
