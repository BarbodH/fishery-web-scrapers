711705,lew,2012-07-04 21:28:00,12766,I can vouch for the quality of both MikeP & Joey's baits.
711706,bare foot wader,2012-07-04 21:30:00,1354,"CT isn't always the best for selection (aside from Lindsay location) but I always check the fishing aisle for clearance stickers, seems to be inconsistent store to store and sometimes get some great deals...got some rapala DT for 5 bucks and max raps for 9.99 (usually 16-20 bucks)  IMO fishing spinnerbaits is like fishing plastics and getting tails bitten off...you're going to lose skirts and blades sometimes, just how it is, good thing is swivels, split rings, blades and skirts are cheap to replace,,,20 bucks will give you the basics to replace things for the season"
711715,Steve,2012-07-04 22:12:00,2075,here ya go.  trust me.  http://www.nicholslures.com/pulsator_metal_flake_spinnerbaits.htm
711718,davey buoy,2012-07-04 22:19:00,5505,Another thing that bothers me as why most manufactures choose not to twist the eye of the spinner bait. This would defineatly help with snap swivel sliding out every once and a while and having to reset it in the groove.
711736,BillM,2012-07-04 23:02:00,17367, Use the rubber tubing you do for your floats..  Works great at keeping the snap where it's supposed to.
711770,Steve,2012-07-05 00:14:00,2075,tie you line directly to the spinnerbait...  no slip.

711830,manitoubass2,2012-07-05 02:17:00,11391,"I always tie direct. The time it takes if far less than correcting fouled lures, no doubt about it. Even if it has a loop instead of an bend, using a snap swivel lessens the action and control of the lure. Also, a snap will pick up debris. If you fish an r bend on a snap, even a slight wind or current will foul you almost every cast"
711834,Pikeslayer,2012-07-05 02:43:00,1443, My 2 best 'go to' SB's  are both made by Mike P (gifts from a fellow OFC'R). Seems I might need to acquire a couple of Joey's for comparison
711835,mercman,2012-07-05 02:56:00,7054," I hate knots...i put a tiny o-ring available at most hardware stores, over the R bend.It keeps the snap from fouling during a cast."

711841,spinnerdoc,2012-07-05 03:57:00,556,"Have you tried making them? I was into making spinners when i first started visiting OFC a few years back. I used heavier gauge wire, actually i used the leaders used for marlin or sail fish. The wire was awesome stainless and coated so it wasn't snapping that's for sure Blades you can go with different kinds and you can add beads as well and hooks you can get really good ones, basically you can get good components that won't be breaking on you.The beauty about it is you just need a pair long nose pliers and your ready to get crakin some wicked spinners. I have not made any for a long while but here are some from the past...these are the only pics i can dig up       "
711844,Cudz,2012-07-05 05:43:00,2652,"Not to hijack this thread but BillM, Frank can make you whatever spinnerbait you want. I love his spinnerbaits.  Northam spinnerbaits.  I believe they are now called big hit lures. http://www.northamfishing.com/  I have several 3/4 oz and 1 oz spinnerbaits from him.  He lives in Barrie and I go to his place once in a while.  If you want we can go and talk to him."
711851,singingdog,2012-07-05 10:04:00,1047,"IMHO, putting a twist eye on a spinnerbait frame takes away a lot of the vibration."
711862,BillM,2012-07-05 11:24:00,17367,"Chris, sounds like a plan man... How'd you make out lastnight?"
711963,DaveMc,2012-07-05 16:59:00,89,"CL Fishin Premium spinnerbaits!!!!! there is nothing else for me. have been fishing them exclusively for the last few years (was fishing some of the first prototypes a few years ago) they have out lasted everything else i have fished, they run better than anything else i have fished, and have caught me more fish than anything else i have fished."
712001,fish_fishburn,2012-07-05 20:51:00,1311,Thanks Dave gonna look into CL fishing.
712088,Cudz,2012-07-06 02:37:00,2652,3 for 5 but I lost a monster. It was pulling drag and I have my drag locked down.  I set the hook really well too. It was a tank. Would have loved to have seen it but no go.  The fish weren't at my spot so I had to move.  I did not go out in boat but simply fished off docks.  Went out for less than 2 hours.  Mosquitoes were stupid but I dressed for the occasion. I can bring by a few samples of those spinnerbaits if you want. Let me know.
712138,BillM,2012-07-06 12:01:00,17367,"Yeah man, I'd like to see a few of them before I dump $10 per on them, lol.   Let's make sure we get out soon man, I still gotta show you the new Lund!"
711524,fish_fishburn,2012-07-04 11:55:00,1311,"Hi guys. Was fishing on the weekend and realized my spinnerbait selection is in sad shape. Tied on a Boyou bait and lost a nice fish because my spinnerbait broke in half. First time that has ever happened, the wire broke on the business end. Also the skirts on a few brand new out of the package Strike King spinnerbaits came off on the first fish. I guess the small elastic bands broke. What is with this at 7 bucks a piece and they fall apart after one fish. Were talking smallies here and not pike. So I was wondering if anyone on here makes quality spinnerbaits and would like to sell some. If anyone is interested let me know and maybe we can do some business. Im tired of buying junk and figure I will try the custom bait route and see how that goes.Thanks"

711533,BillM,2012-07-04 12:38:00,17367,I'd like to find some short armed heavier spinner baits (3/4 to 1oz) for smallies.  Anyone know where I could pick up a few of these?
711548,bigmac1984,2012-07-04 13:19:00,193,"Try luremaking.com. you can buy pre-poured heads and then paint them and put whatever skirts on them you see fit. You can buy all the other accessories like blades, beads, clevices, swivels, etc. for relatively cheap and the quality is good. If you are looking to re-build your aresnal of spinnerbaits, this route will be much cheaper, and you know the quality because you made them! It also is a cool feeling when you catch a fish on something you made.  The people at luremaking.com are also great to deal with. I've bought 4 rounds of stuff from them now and they ship it same day in most cases, but it arrives within 2 days typically.  Good luck"
711549,BillM,2012-07-04 13:20:00,17367,"Very cool, appreciate the info."
711581,bigmac1984,2012-07-04 15:22:00,193,"Forgot to mention they are also located in Owen Sound, so they are a Canadian seller."
711582,Steve,2012-07-04 15:26:00,2075,"There is one brand of spinnerbaits that sits well above the rest.  Nichols.  Folks up here used to sell them, but due to their price (10.99 at min) they didn't sell.  We order direct from Nichols."
711583,EC1,2012-07-04 15:29:00,930," Strike King Bottom Dweller has been great! Honestly though, 3/4 to 1oz spinners are ok to use once you're fishing about 10FOW.  As for good spinnerbaits, the KoManChi one is decent, looks great in the water and caught me a few fish. Only problem is that it used to be a double willow until a pike destroyed the secondary blade. The bait still works, and I still throw it once in a while. If not, I also liked the old terminator T1's with a single colorado blade.  If you're not looking to drop a ton of coin for spinnerbaits, I guess almost all of the strike king spinnerbaits are decent."
711585,Handlebarz,2012-07-04 15:39:00,3790,For bass I would also sugges cl fishin Carl is a member here. If you want a good flshsabou pike size ones I make them about 2oz they are built with the same heavy stainless steel as all my baits are so you will be safe for musky that's what we use them here for on LSC.
711590,Joey,2012-07-04 15:59:00,9122,I make them and can make them to your size if you want.  Any colour etc.  PM me if you'd like.
711591,BillM,2012-07-04 16:02:00,17367," That's exactly what I was fishing this weekend.  Breaks from 8-10ft down to 14-20ft..  In order to get the baits down on the weekend, I had to slow roll them like crazy, would have liked to speed things up a bit and still keep my depth consistent.  I've seen those bottom dwellers, I'll have to grab a few of them."
711596,bare foot wader,2012-07-04 16:42:00,1354,"smallies will bust spinnerbaits just as hard as pike, wouldn't feel too bad about that...I think it's a balance between too thin and too stiff wire used, too stiff and it detracts from the vibrations, in theory, I have a friend who ties musky bucktails on what I would consider bass guage wire  I've never had a terminator spinnerbait break on me....and i like their skirts, the one piece design, no elastic band"
711608,fish_fishburn,2012-07-04 17:11:00,1311,"I used to use Picasso's which I really like but they must of changed their materials because they seem to be of poor quality as of late so I don't buy them any more. The Terminators are good but pricey. I checked CL spinnerbaits and they look good. The sassy shad looks like a killer bait, might have to give them a try. I bought some of the Izumi bleeding shad I think they were called and they were junk. Think they were made by Strikeking. Couldn't get any of them to run right and the skirts were cheap. I have a few Reef Runners I bought a few years ago in the 1 and 11/2 sizes they work great for deeper water and ripping  in shallower water but I cant remember where I bought them and can't seem to find them in my area."
711624,bare foot wader,2012-07-04 17:54:00,1354,"one of my favourite spinner baits is the KVD in bluegill, deadly"
711625,Raf,2012-07-04 18:05:00,3495,"the mass market bass sized SBs of today are pure garbage plain and simple  i am disgusted at the chickenpoop wire which bends and breaks very easily in the booyah, strike king etc products  not to mention i thoroughly hate the r-bend design which they all come in.  give me closed loop any day.  i have several SBs of late 80s/early90s vintage (blue fox and others) that are still solid after many years of use, many fish with teeth and many tail replacements."
711628,fish_fishburn,2012-07-04 18:09:00,1311,I hear ya loud and clear Raf. I prefer the closed loop as well.
711662,davey buoy,2012-07-04 19:16:00,5505, Bill those terminator spinner baits at CT look heavy and well made with a slightly higher price tag.

I'll let you know Saturday evening how it stood up.:PI still think I'll pick up one of the terminators,I believe they are 1/2 or 3/4 oz thou.Bigger gear time I'm sure."
711690,aplumma,2012-07-04 20:44:00,6896, I would order more of them from you Joey but I haven't been able to tear up the last batch. Your quality is going to put you out of business.   Art
711695,manitoubass2,2012-07-04 20:52:00,11391,"I like the Terminator spinnerbaits and the StrikeKing Potbellies, but I replace the split rings on both of them. I've had bad  experiences losing blades up till I decided to change em out. They catch alot of great fish (especially the potbellies) if your wondering why I still buy them, lol."
711696,davey buoy,2012-07-04 20:55:00,5505," I haven't seen the pot bellies,but what weight works for you with the terminators? .Can't remember the exact weight size I saw."
711699,manitoubass2,2012-07-04 20:58:00,11391," The terminators I use are 3/4 oz, and I prefer them shallow in the heavier current.  If I'm fishing walleye/bass/pike throughout the water column, I gotta use the pot bellies in 1 oz. I fish em as deep as 25ft, and never have issues with them outside of that split ring that like to break (on both models)   "
711701,206,2012-07-04 21:05:00,563,"I stick with the Strike king and they seem to work fine...although i have this one old one in the box fish can't resist but i don't even know who makes it?  Heads up not sure about all, but the cobourg crappy tire had the pot belly on clearance for $2.63/2.73 don't feel so bad to loose a 3 dollar spinner then a ten dollar one."
711703,manitoubass2,2012-07-04 21:08:00,11391," Thanks for the heads up, I'll be looking tomorrow as I have to pick up some new camping gear anyhow. I'll be looking for chart. and black/silver, just for back ups. I think they were around $6 a pop last time I bought any   "
