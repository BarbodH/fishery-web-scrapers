712426,Billy Bob,2012-07-07 09:11:00,5865,Yes....but sometimes there are ignorant laws too.
712437,ecmilley,2012-07-07 13:00:00,2163,this would apply to provincial boundrys like the ottawa river
712448,GbayGiant,2012-07-07 13:35:00,1780,"You fish an area where you know you can run into problems. You know where the lines are and I would think your friend does as well. If you were not sure where the lines were, I would think you would stay well clear of any boarder. Do you not have to ""check in"" by going to shore first when fishing US waters? You are crossing the boarder after all. Your friend should Pay the fines and realize not to do it again.  cheers."
712460,mike rousseau,2012-07-07 14:10:00,4661,  This situation was regarding a PROVINTIAL border not INTERNATIONAL...  And no you do not have to check in by going to shore when crossing to the usa side....You require special paper work... And check in by calling with your ID #...  And like I posted earlier... He IS paying the fine...  I'm trying to point out a really stupid set of rules that should be changed....  And when I said I hoped he would fight it it was only in hopes of shedding light on a confusing situation...
712465,ch312,2012-07-07 14:24:00,1590," while i agree that it's not exactly the way thing's should be done, in the end it's up to the fisherman to know the laws for the water he/she is fishing in order to avoid stuff like this. as previously mentioned, staying well away from the border is the easiest and most reliable option.  saying that your friend is innocent because he didn't know where the border was is the same as saying it's ok to keep out of season fish if you weren't aware of the season in the first place. ignorance often costs $$$"
712468,Woodsman,2012-07-07 14:30:00,1286,"Not entirely accurate. My guess the ""special paper work"" you are referring to is a Nexus card. Only valid if everyone on the boat has one. Also only good for entry into the US & not valid for entering Canada. No reporting in to the US authorities is required as long as you don't anchor, go ashore or enter inland waters. In this case border rivers are not classed as inland waters. Your first entry of the day into Canada from the US waters requires a call to Canadian Customs."
712477,mike rousseau,2012-07-07 14:46:00,4661,  I was referring to the I-68  Not nexus
712483,Woodsman,2012-07-07 15:04:00,1286,"The I-68 works similar to the Nexus card. All aboard must have one. Again not required to fish US waters as long as you don't anchor, go ashore or enter inland waters. For just fishing without anchoring no reporting in is required."
712484,Terry,2012-07-07 15:12:00,14456,"ok  your friend may have accidentally broke the law, but they can't just let people slide because they were in a canoe and no electronics or the next day every low life will learn the ""canoe and no electronics"" loop hole and will be using it to circumvent the slot regs  just like the guys that posted that the MNR was morons for charging them for having a slot fish and they tried to justify it by saying it was dead and could not be released, so we kept it...they were surprised to see that almost everyone told them they were wrong and to just pay the fine..cause if they stopped charging people who said it couldn't be released....people would just let slot fish die so they could keep them..the law and boundaries may be confusing but we still have to follow the rules"
712144,kickingfrog,2012-07-06 12:16:00,8333, THAT would be correct.
712145,mike rousseau,2012-07-06 12:20:00,4661,  But what I'm saying is you shouldn't have to buy a gps...  It's not fair that every angler in my area has to own a gps so they know where the border is...  It wouldn't be bad if the shipping Chanel was the border... Then there would be no confusion... But that's not the case... It's a jagged border line that makes many turns and cuts back and forth in the middle of nowhere...
712146,BillM,2012-07-06 12:26:00,17367,"I agree that it should be marked as well and easily visible.  If someone still goes through it, then it's nothing but stupidity."
712147,mercman,2012-07-06 12:35:00,7054,"   And unless the angler is a repeat, or known poacher, a warning, and a quick education should be sufficient the first time."
712148,ecmilley,2012-07-06 12:39:00,2163,"not as cut and dryed as you may think it has always been my understanding that fishing in border water area's the regulations are in effect for the license you carry, ontario license ontario rules. http://www.mnr.gov.on.ca/en/Business/LetsFish/2ColumnSubPage/STEL02_165335.html start reading pretty sure i am correct but the OFC crack legal team of experts will figure it out i am sure"
712149,ecmilley,2012-07-06 12:41:00,2163,"it's easy mike, when you see the pountine truck and beer in the corner store your in quebec"
712150,smally21,2012-07-06 12:41:00,993,"If the GPS argument was brought up the prosecutor types could simply say the border is clearly marked on the chart that you are legally required to have on board your boat at all times..  GPS is not an acceptable form of knowing where you are, or navigating, according to the establishment anyway only govt charts are acceptable..  BTW I don't agree with anything i just wrote GPS is THE way to navigate and know where you are but i do beleive it would be entered in the argument...  Just tossing this out as the GPS seemed to come up repeatedly...and yes i know that 'significant local knowledge' is written into the language as well but the 'defence' is basically ""i didn't know where I was"" so essentially you can't argue that you dont have charts cause you are familiar with the area but i dont know where i am in the same breath...  starting to ramble was up late...  difficult scenario should be streamlined of course the problem goes away if you just let the fish go...but they are tasty no matter what passport they carry or language they speak!"
712155,Ralph Field,2012-07-06 12:50:00,1018,"Last year if you were fishing the Niagara river you were suppose to phone the customs office when you crossed the border, even though you had no intention of landing on the opposite shore. I think it was the Canadian customs that were causing all the problems. Hopefully commonsense prevailed there and this is no longer is demanded. I would guess that these same stupid rules could apply here."
712168,ctered,2012-07-06 13:22:00,40,"No they have not changed anything on the Niagara. The coast guard has been out this year sending people back if they had not called in to say they were crossing the border. I hope your friend has all 3 licenses for Ont,PQ, and NY or he could get charged for no license as well."
712171,mercman,2012-07-06 13:39:00,7054,"  Poutine trucks are illegal now in Quebec You have to go to a ""Pataterie"" to get the provincial delicacy Just look for the rough water, that means your in Quebec."
712186,Billy Bob,2012-07-06 14:04:00,5865,When I fish the boarder waters on Lake Erie (and I do this almost every time out for walleye) the boarder is CLEARLY marked by a line on my Navionics Mapping...I know exactly when I'm in Canadian waters or NYS waters....If I remember tomorrow I'll switch it to Eastern NY and check if there are boarder lines in the questioned area.
712206,bubbles,2012-07-06 15:20:00,591,"I think we are all just a little spoiled with our relationship we share with the US.  If we bordered Russia or North Korea I bet you would know exactly where the border is or you would learn mighty quick.  I fish the detroit river all the time, I know ROUGHLY where the border is and stay clear of it to avoid any issues like this one."
712225,Fisherman,2012-07-06 16:27:00,7201," Not according to this:  If you are operating a boat under 100 gross tons, you do not have to carry these charts, documents and publications on board as long as you know:  the location and type of charted: shipping routes; lights, buoys and marks; and boating hazards; and the areaâ€™s usual boating conditions such as tides, currents, ice and weather patterns."
712234,BillM,2012-07-06 16:52:00,17367,"So if you're fishing border waters, one would think you should know the boundaries no?"
712239,lew,2012-07-06 17:04:00,12766, Sometimes there's no way to know Bill as there are absolutely no markers of any kind where Mikes talking about. It's a huge body of water that touches 2 provinces and the US.  Sorta like trolling across Lake O with nothing on your GPS and putting your finger directly on the Canada/US border.
712241,BillM,2012-07-06 17:06:00,17367," I realize that, but the thought should still be in the back of your head.  I agree there should be some kind of marker out there.  Better safe then sorry (In this case to the tune of $355)"
712246,smally21,2012-07-06 17:21:00,993,"Fisherman ""local knowledge"" was covered in my post. you require charts unless you know the waters and the items you mentioned.  it was clearly stated that if one was to argue they had local knowledge, ie of the items you stated, then they would also have to state that they 'knew' where they were and the explanation 'sorry didn't know i was in another region' would be contradictory.  yer guilty of failing to have charts, OR knowingly fishing outside the licensed territory, but not both....  perhaps read the post again."
712248,aplumma,2012-07-06 17:25:00,6896,I would think if in doubt move to an area that you are sure of. Fish are all over they are not only in the sketchy areas he fished in. We have boundaries here between D.C. Maryland and Virginia. If you fish D.C. without their license your busted. If you put a bait net out in Maryland your busted. If you possess a Striper in the wrong zone you will get a ticket. It is something I live with every time I fish.I also took the time to learn and use a GPS to keep from getting a ticket. If you can't afford the tools needed to obey the laws then you don't have the resources to fish there it is that easy. I spend over $200.00 a year in licenses to be able to fish in the three zones it's not a gray area it is in black in white and easily verified with modern navigational equipment that is available to everyone.   Art
712270,Billy Bob,2012-07-06 18:40:00,5865," I just checked that area with my Lowrance GPS unit using both Navionics and Lowrance mapping software.....Navionics has detail just about EVERYTHING you need to navigate through that area....it shows all the channel markers and channels you need to stay in for safe voyage...BUT not the boundaries of NYS, Ontario or Quebec....However when I switch to my USA form of Lowrance mapping software it does show the boundaries BUT then loses all the water in Canada....so that's pretty useless.......maybe a Canada version of Lowrance mapping would so more water detail of the Cornwall, Ontario area.  Now on Lake Ontario my Navionics does NOT show the Ontario/NYS boundary but when I switch to Lowrance Mapping software it does show the boundary...however it's a very faint line, but it's there......  Now on Lake Erie near the Buffalo area, my Navionics CLEARLY shows the USA/Canada boundary line and every detail I need to fish that area.  GO FIGURE.....   Bob"
712298,lew,2012-07-06 19:26:00,12766," When I said there were no markers Bob, I meant nothing to show the provincial or Canada/USA boundaries.  Everything else is well marked as you say."
712302,Billy Bob,2012-07-06 19:38:00,5865,YES......that was my point......everything BUT the boundary lines....
712318,John Bacon,2012-07-06 20:25:00,3277," Don't you require a license for the juristiction you are fishing? If you are on the St. Lawrence and want to fish the U.S. side, wouldn't you require a US fishing license?"
712324,Terry,2012-07-06 20:35:00,14456,yeah but bottom line is  did he know the border was somewhere in the area that he was going to fish...you are obligated to know knowing he was fishing near the border did he buy all the licenses and if you know there is some chance you could be in their waters how can you help but expect to respect the limits in all areas and that if stopped you would have to expect that you could be charged
712391,mike rousseau,2012-07-07 00:55:00,4661,on an provincial border water you dont need both licenses... i can fish QC with my ontario license...  however...  you cannot fish NY border waters with any ontario or quebec license...... thats international... and a different ball game...
712413,danc,2012-07-07 03:27:00,4677,"You can use the sun and the moon and the stars, or fancy electronics to know just exactly where you are on the water, but bottom line here is that its up to you figure it all out. Like the old saying goes, ignorance of the law is not an excuse."
712026,mike rousseau,2012-07-05 23:34:00,4661,"My buddy just got charged by the Mnr for poaching because he crossed into Quebec with walleye in his live well outside the slot... But these fish were caught in ontario... And he would have been returning to Ontario with these fish...  And Im in an area where USA Ontario and Quebec intersect... So if anglers follow all slots and regs just incase they wanna fish spots in different zones... They have a 5 inch slot they can keep fish in without being charged....15.5-20.5  inches... On a normal day most don't catch many that small... So basically in order to keep ANY walleye anglers will have to fish each zone at a time starting with USA(over 18"") then Quebec (14.5-20.5) then Ontario ( no size limit)... And this is the same water body and the three zones intersect each other...  And worst of all... The Quebec/Ontario border isn't shown on navionics... So most people don't really know where the line is...  I think a far better set up on border waters would be to follow the rules according to your license... And where you launch from... That way there is less confusion amongst anglers...  Luckily the way I do my daily run it's actually convenient for me to fish Quebec then Ontario... Or NY state then Ontario... Up/down river on one side then back to Ontario to head back the other way... And ""I"" am aware of these slots... However most are not aware of these little Bull rules and loads of anglers in my area follow Ontario regs on the Quebec side.... So pretty well most walleye anglers in my area are poachers according to these regs... All because there's 3 sets of rules for the same area... And im not talking a big area... I can do a couple minute drift and go through USA-Quebec-Ontario.... So depending on where you are in the drift you can keep different sizes of fish... But if you do... Chances are you cannot do the drift again because you'll be in possession of a fish outside the slot in one of the 3 zones...  I find it hard to believe that those who make/enforce the rules can't see this and can't make it simpler like I said... Follow your regs based on licence and launch zone... If your fishing an Ontario Quebec border water you follow the regs according the the province you launch from and you need to posses a licence for the Provence you launch from...  By the way...  It was $325  For being 100 feet over a line in the water that isn't event show on navionics....  They sure aren't making things easy for new/casual anglers...   Sorry my rant...  Mike"
712030,Pikeslayer,2012-07-05 23:46:00,1443,My psycho senses are screaming Mike. I see a court date in your buddies future.
712031,Billy Bob,2012-07-05 23:47:00,5865,"I fish BOTH NYS and Ontario waters at the same time on Lake Erie.......until this year NYS had a five fish limit while Ontario has a 6 fish limit....AND Ontario does NOT have a size limit for walleyes.....but here's the thing.......if I fish ONLY Ontario waters I can get away with walleyes under 15"" as long as I DON'T stop and fish in NYS waters while I have those under size fish (according to NYS) in my live well......  NYS FINALLY went to a 6 fish limit on Lake Erie.........WHY.....because Ontario, PA, OH and MI all had a 6 fish limit and our fishing clubs got together with the NYS Federation and put pressure on NYS DEC to raise the limit to all other boarding states/Canada....and remember......Ontario is the only government agency that allows commercial fishing on Lake Erie.."
712035,mercman,2012-07-06 00:08:00,7054,  eggzackly what i told him
712040,mike rousseau,2012-07-06 00:18:00,4661,  Problem is... This IS the law... There's no grey area...other then not knowing where the border lies... So by going to court he MAY shed light on this stupid situation... And he has the money to take it pretty far...
712045,danc,2012-07-06 00:34:00,4677,Tell him to save his money and pay the fine. He broke the law. End of story. My hand held Garmin shows provincial and USA borders within 20 feet just fine.
712050,mike rousseau,2012-07-06 00:46:00,4661, And for those that don't have a gps?  Or have a gps that doesn't show provincial borders on the water....  I know he broke the law... He now knows he broke the law... The problem is the law...  Like billy bob said... Erie borders changed their limits to be the same.... So why not get rid of the slots all around on the st.lawrence river... Or have a slot but make it the same...
712057,mercman,2012-07-06 01:02:00,7054,"if enough groups and anglers complain Mike, things may happen.Unfortunately i cant see that happening in my lifetime.Maybe give navionics a call, an ask em why we pay hundreds of bucks for thier software, and they cant put borders on it? I just spent 260 bucks for navigable waters, i never even thought .about provincial and US borders.I assumed it would be on it"
712059,ctdd2006,2012-07-06 01:03:00,531,Very curious how this plays out.
712060,Roy,2012-07-06 01:05:00,13728,Didn't your bud know the slot and possession limits for those jurisdictions?
712067,mercman,2012-07-06 01:19:00,7054,  LOL !! He's gone to work and left us hanging
712070,danc,2012-07-06 01:32:00,4677," ""But your Honour. My navonics chip doesn't show provincial or state boundaries, therefore I'm innocent"".  You really think that this is gonna cut it? As for the three jurisdictions getting together on slot sizes, they all have their own reason for setting it where it is. Who's is most right is anyone's guess."
712076,Pikeslayer,2012-07-06 02:05:00,1443,"Just for kicks and giggles Mike, I'll throw one of the associates on it. Actually, Dan C. Gave me an idea with the mention of ""within 20 feet"". Check with your friend and see if the GPS coordinates are inclusive and documented. Email me the docs if you prefer."
712083,danc,2012-07-06 02:21:00,4677," Actually I was being generous with the 20 feet. My hand held is often within 8 or 9 feet according to it, and waypoints that I've previously marked. But if I was using it for legal reasons, I'd give it at least a couple hundred feet myself."
712121,mike rousseau,2012-07-06 10:44:00,4661, Wow... I guess I'm gunna have to simplify a bit...  How is buddy in a conoe without electronics supposed to know he's 20 feet over an invisible line????   And that invisible line has different rules on the other side...  So he crosses the line by 20 feet not knowing and gets nailed for poaching walleye... And you dont think it would get overturned on court...?  At least 9/10 boaters in my area probably couldn't tell you where the border is exactly... It's rediculus for authorities to expect this...
712124,mike rousseau,2012-07-06 10:50:00,4661,BTW He's not fighting it...  The ticket is cheaper then a lawyer....  Off to the Ottawa for some musky...  Have a good day fellas

712126,Fisherman,2012-07-06 11:15:00,7201,"Maybe we should change the scenario to something like this and see how it plays out:  Lets go tresspass 20 feet into China with just thinking about poaching a fish or two.  You get caught, have a trial on the same day and get shot.  So maybe it's called responsibility, something that a lot of people shirk and blame everything and everybody else but themselves."
712130,DanD,2012-07-06 11:37:00,2223,"Kind of reminds me of the West Arm, when the slot was first introduced. Then West of Hwy64 was a different zone, which didnâ€™t have a slot size. So youâ€™d catch a legal fish in letâ€™s say Warren Bay; but youâ€™re staying east of 64, cross under the bridge to go home and now you have an illegal fish in your possession. We were never stopped but I always wondered how that conversation would have gone? Honest officer we were over there; but you and the fish are now over here. I guess it would have been a judgment call on whether the CO believed you or not; I guess this CO didnâ€™t believe your buddy? Some official finally clued in and made the whole area the same zone.  Dan."
712132,mike rousseau,2012-07-06 11:48:00,4661, As long as you don't stop between the one zone and you dock/ramp your ok...  Like here... Perch is open year round on the NY side... So once perch closes here lots of guys cross to NY and target perch there... But you CAN NOT stop between the border and launch/dock...  That's what I was told by the MNR anyways...
