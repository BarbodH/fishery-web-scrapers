711886,Grimsby Tackle,2012-07-05 13:43:00,10,"week 1 winner 20lbs 6ozs. looking to be a good fun series of derbies stop in and grab your ticket by friday for this saturdays derby, forecast is looking good and the fishing has been great       edit: print error, derby runs until sept 1st"
711888,Christopheraaron,2012-07-05 13:46:00,3525,If it runs to september then could the salmon be taken from a river?
711889,BillM,2012-07-05 13:50:00,17367, It ends August 28th....
711891,Christopheraaron,2012-07-05 13:53:00,3525,Read the edit
711896,BillM,2012-07-05 14:04:00,17367, I don't see why not.  A salmon is a salmon (River or lake shouldn't matter)
711911,Grimsby Tackle,2012-07-05 14:44:00,10,"yes, september 1st is the last event of the series and river fish are permitted  "
711915,Christopheraaron,2012-07-05 14:57:00,3525,Maybe I'll just have to enter! I forget what order do the salmon run in?
711919,kickingfrog,2012-07-05 15:05:00,8333," Chronological in odd numbered years, alphabetical in even years."
711921,Christopheraaron,2012-07-05 15:07:00,3525," LOL, I mean when does each specie enter spawning grounds?"
711937,BillM,2012-07-05 15:42:00,17367," If you're fishing around Sept 1, you won't be fishing in the rivers, you'll be fishing the river mouths.  They'll still be out in the lake staging for the most part.  Guys do really well off the piers."
711938,Christopheraaron,2012-07-05 15:43:00,3525,"Would I be expecting chinook, coho come first right?"
711941,Steve,2012-07-05 15:49:00,2075,"i'd think they don't want fish coming from rivers, as anglers should catch, not snag fish, in order to be eligible."
711943,BillM,2012-07-05 15:56:00,17367," Chinook first, then the ho's."
711948,dave524,2012-07-05 16:05:00,4508," Actually, it has been my experience that the main Coho runs come after the main Chinook run is a rotting memory , in years gone by I've seen very bright fresh Cohoes in the river as late as Dec with ice forming in the river."
711956,Christopheraaron,2012-07-05 16:37:00,3525,"Thanks! And who said anything about snagging steve? you can still legally catch salmon in rivers, it's just harder..."
711957,BillM,2012-07-05 16:38:00,17367, Let's not open that can of worms.
712022,miller,2012-07-05 22:57:00,223,yeah no need to open that up. the point of the derby is just to keep it fun and have something guys can enter in when they plan on fishing a weekend rather than spending over $100 on a single ticket. as of the past few days i've heard theres been some big ones kicking around so this weekend will hopefully produce some of those bigger fish
