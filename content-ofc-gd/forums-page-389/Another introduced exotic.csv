712137,Dave Bailey,2012-07-06 11:59:00,1641,Fortunately they probably won't survive the winter: the Pacu
712151,mercman,2012-07-06 12:42:00,7054,"Man............. What a way to go!!!!The should rename that fish. The Ex-Fish, for obvious reasons.  "
712153,johnnyb,2012-07-06 12:45:00,3413,That's nuts.
712160,Rod Caster,2012-07-06 13:05:00,5784,"Nice ""post-op""tion.  "
712163,UglyBug,2012-07-06 13:10:00,148,Holy crap batman  Time for steel jocks....  
712165,Roy,2012-07-06 13:14:00,13728,Make swimming in the lake only open to civil servants and they'll starve to death.
712169,Headhunter,2012-07-06 13:27:00,5703,Ha Ha Ha!!!!!! HH
712174,NAW,2012-07-06 13:42:00,4022," Litterally!!  ""recently two men were horribly mutilated and died when the same type of fish viciously attacked and bit off their testicles...:  Is this a joke?  That is crazy.  This is totally ironic, because I had a dream last night that I lost my boys to TC."
712182,capt bruce,2012-07-06 13:58:00,820,"  Saw these fish on that river monsters  show with that guy Jeremy Wade, locals call them nut cutter fish . He catchs one and holds open its mouth to show the teeth that look alot like human teeth , they eat nuts that fall into the river and use their teeth to crush them ."
712184,John,2012-07-06 13:58:00,2956,I guess I'm safe mine were matrimonially removed years ago.....
712189,SRT8 smoker craft,2012-07-06 14:16:00,1107,these are definately not new people have been dumping them into lakes for years and they can survive our winters the one I caught was on corn carp fishing and they fight really good there were 2 more caught after mine and none since so it was probably 1 person dumping their aquarium .here's a pic   
712194,mercman,2012-07-06 14:42:00,7054,"  Thanks  have been looking for the proper terminology for that, for a long time"
712235,EC1,2012-07-06 16:52:00,930,"Didn't you guys watch River Monsters? The locals of wherever named them the ""Ball Cutter"""
712236,uglyfish,2012-07-06 16:58:00,981,"Yea, I don't buy that story much at all. But they can survive winters here. Pirhanas too. I seen 3 caught in local waters one being pulled through the ice.  I believe the pacu's that were caught were in lake simcoe?"
712261,Locnar,2012-07-06 18:15:00,645, You made a punny! hah haaaa
