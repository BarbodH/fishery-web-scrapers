711973,GreenCanada,2012-07-05 18:39:00,375,"1) The Leafs have some pretty decent defencemen already, and their prospects are also pretty solid on the blue line. So it would be nice to get Suter, but not for that ridiculous contract.  2) Parise isn't worth nearly that much. Period. Look at comparable contracts and point production.  The Wild need to attract some attention for their fans, but these two players are not worth the superstar contracts they got. Suter is definitely a top two d-man on any team but that contract will hurt the Wild in the long run. Hopefully this move won't end up causing the team to move, but I believe within the next five years the Wild will be looking to relocate. Not just because of these two contracts, but it will be the catalyst.  I'm sufficiently happy with how Burke has been playing this out. He hasn't gotten himself tangled up in ridiculous signings this off season and the notion that we NEED Nash is overrated. Yes, Nash is a good player, but Columbus isn't going to move him unless they get a kings ransom. Let me assure you, Nash is a good player, but definitely not worth giving up all our depth (and cap space) to get.  There are lots of good first line centres available for trade and I hope Burke keeps his lips shut to the media so they don't ruin it for everyone. The ridiculous media intensity (and micro analysis) around the Leafs is in my eyes the primary issue that needs to be fixed. With Burke keeping his cards close to his chest, hopefully we can make some moves to improve the team.  Oh, and it would be nice to get Luongo but again not for a ridiculous price. Maybe Komi and a mid-level prospect or Komi and 3rd (or later round pick in 2013)  Go Leafs!"
711998,davey buoy,2012-07-05 20:46:00,5505," I'm glad your happy with the way Burke is handling things:whistling:Don't spend any money ,that will do it!lol."
711999,fish_fishburn,2012-07-05 20:47:00,1311,"What do the raptors, leafs argos and blue jays have in common besides playing in Toronto?               None of them can play HOCKEY."
712000,davey buoy,2012-07-05 20:49:00,5505,
712004,misfish,2012-07-05 21:12:00,29133,What happen to the Tim Thomas talk with the leafs?   HYPE AGAIN  :dunno:
712005,davey buoy,2012-07-05 21:16:00,5505, I heard he was taking a year off now.Can't be 100% positive.I'm sure he would cost the leafs a few bucks so I can't see that happening!!lol.
712008,misfish,2012-07-05 21:19:00,29133,Wanna bet? LOL
712010,uglyfish,2012-07-05 21:24:00,981," Parise is still young, he's only gonna get better. The contracts won't hurt the team. And no, no player is worth the money they are paid. Toronto already overspent on a lackluster player... Grabovski. No need to dump more money  Komisarek is the only defensive dman they have left. If they play him proper minutes, he'll be solid on the back end. Gardiner is still learning and we'll see how he handles year 2. Phaneuf and liles were useless last year."
712011,jedimaster,2012-07-05 21:32:00,3472,  They have more Championships than the Ottawa Profesional Sports teams.
712042,Jigger,2012-07-06 00:28:00,1237,"I like what Burke has done so far. McClemont sounds like a terrific signing and deepens the C position. JVR, if he can stay healthy, is a huge boost for the top6. BB has alot of cash to play with, and with the right manoeuvering, a 1C could be all the team needs to gain some ground in the East.  Nash is redundant at this stage. As long as he stays in the West."
712237,jedimaster,2012-07-06 17:01:00,3472,"So I heard that carlisle said he is going to be running jvr up the middle on the top line through camp.... I recall a thread a while ago where I said jvr will be tested at center and if nash got here so would he.... I got ripped up for that. Haha.. Now I am not saying it would work just that its gonna happen at least for a test.  Anyway... Not much left on the market lou doesn't sound like its gonna happen, and nash who knows.... Is anyone left? What trades are available? It'll be interesting to see what the lines are coming out of camp."
712268,davey buoy,2012-07-06 18:40:00,5505,"I have not given up,but what I've seen so far,IMO,is no where near what they need.If Burke was to get fired before season starts I will be sad for the organization not giving him enough of a chance:whistling:."
712329,Jigger,2012-07-06 20:58:00,1237,"Let me get this straight. JVR, who hasnt played center since college and has a 40% faceoff, is going to C the 1st line? With Bozak, Grabo, Connoly, mcClemont and Steckel on the big club? Kadri and Colbourne are also going to get a look, or are they?? My high opinion of Carlyle has already taken a hit. Silly move is putting it mildly."
712330,davey buoy,2012-07-06 21:00:00,5505," Don't hold back jigger,tell us what you really think!!lol. Just kidding.As I said earlier someones going to have to pull a rabbit out of there :asshat:to make this team a contender!!!!"
712352,GreenCanada,2012-07-06 22:02:00,375," haha, beat me to it!  With regards to JVR possibly moving to centre, I'm not sure about this. He is a natural winger and was only moved to centre in college because they had injury problems, if memory serves me correct. When he was drafted by the Flyers he was drafted as a winger (the move to centre in college happened after the draft), and the move to centre was not appreciated by the Flyers management. So we'll see how the experiment at centre works out for him as he is a big body (though not a checker by nature).  Bozak can hopefully up his game and fill the centre role if JVR doesn't work out there.  Tim Thomas? I'd rather not make the playoffs for another 5 years than have that ignorant self serving bum on the Leafs."
711606,DRIFTER_016,2012-07-04 17:05:00,10439,Looks like the Minnesota Wild just got a lot stronger as they have agreements in place with both Suter and Parise!!   Free Agent Signing
711630,kickingfrog,2012-07-04 18:11:00,8333,That's big for the Wild. Looks like they got matching deals.
711631,BillM,2012-07-04 18:12:00,17367,I can't believe NJ would let Parise go...  That's one move I would have bet against.
711633,kickingfrog,2012-07-04 18:18:00,8333,The devils have serious cash flow problems.
711636,jedimaster,2012-07-04 18:20:00,3472,Burke better start picking up something.... nash...???
711638,kickingfrog,2012-07-04 18:27:00,8333,How high are the expectations now in Minny?
711650,misfish,2012-07-04 18:44:00,29133,Whats with Jugar getting 5 mil for one year???????????????
711653,kickingfrog,2012-07-04 18:54:00,8333," The Stars not only missed the play-offs, but they didn't watch them either."
711667,Rod Caster,2012-07-04 19:35:00,5784,Also very suprised to see parise move. I would have dropped Kovy well before I got rid of parise.
711669,jedimaster,2012-07-04 19:39:00,3472,"I don't minni will have much expectation this year considering they missed the playoffs by a good margin last year, but they will be looking forward to making the playoffs."
711674,kickingfrog,2012-07-04 19:52:00,8333," Parise was a UFA, he had total freedom to go where he wanted. Highest bidder or team that had the best future (in his opinion) or he could go home."
711675,davey buoy,2012-07-04 19:52:00,5505,"Are you all getting the feeling nobody wants to come to Toronto?. I don't know if Burke is being cheap,or the year after year after year etc not doing anything productive.Not to mention the pressure with a losing team.Sorry guys,just on the outside looking in."
711676,jedimaster,2012-07-04 19:54:00,3472,"I think burke could have had a few free agents over the last few years, but burke hasn't wanted to pull the trigger... Richards is one I think he could have had if he had of put the term out there. I am hoping he can get a deal on luongo before the season starts as I doubt vancouver will want to have both goalies at camp.  I am still holding out for nash as well."
711679,davey buoy,2012-07-04 19:58:00,5505, I'd like to see something as well but won't hold my breath. I hear there's a lot of talent in the farm team..That should help us in the future(5 years?).
711680,jedimaster,2012-07-04 20:00:00,3472,"There is some talent in the farm team, and cap space... Not many guys need to be re signed so I am hpoing that Nash, Luo or both can get done."
711681,kickingfrog,2012-07-04 20:05:00,8333, The cap changed a lot of things. Lots of teams can offer the same amount of money. The result is the player can play in a city that he can walk a block from the rink and be just another face in the crowd. The money spends the same but the anonymity is priceless.
711878,bushart,2012-07-05 12:36:00,2628,Well never mind the usual frontrunners in the east for the top 8 playoff spots   you'll need to add TB lightning  They got better adding Salo---now Defenceman Carle---they already got firepower up front  Can't see Sens or Leafs havin an easy run to post season next year  Don't forget Stall and now Corvo gone to Hurricanes
711887,jedimaster,2012-07-05 13:44:00,3472,"IMO tampa is aging, I am not worried abut them. I think The Jets and Carolina will be better this year."
711897,Headhunter,2012-07-05 14:17:00,5703,"Why would anyone want to come to Toronto to play hockey under a microscope? I've had that feeling for quite some time... the Leafs are an organization that is the laughing stock of the NHL... you only had to watch the Allstar Game a couple of years ago to see evidence of that (the treatment Kessel got during the captains picks) Four newpapers, countless radio talk shows, multiple TV channels and each one has atleast one or two reporters who follow every move the team makes. It takes a special kind of athlete to survive, much less thrive in this sort of environment... most just want to play and get paid. HH"
711901,jedimaster,2012-07-05 14:24:00,3472,Not to mention the attention the leafs get on the various internet forums not even related to hockey whatsoever. Most forums can't even go a week without talking about the leafs. lol
711903,John,2012-07-05 14:33:00,2956, Steve Nash may help them more........
711907,Broker,2012-07-05 14:40:00,482,"I'm hoping the habs will bounce back this year , they look good on paper to me , with the added gritty players like prust and armstrong. I wouldnt wanna play a fourth line of white moen and prust.. that new draft pick should help out there smaller fowards if he can crack the line up!"
711912,bushart,2012-07-05 14:54:00,2628,  Gionta should be back  Gotta find a home for Gomez  They'll be tougher  Never should have traded their goal scorer last year to Calgary IMO
711945,uglyfish,2012-07-05 16:02:00,981, Nash won't be in toronto. Burke won't give up the ridiculous amount that columbus is asking for.
711949,uglyfish,2012-07-05 16:09:00,981," Well before the signing, cup odds were 200-1  And after, 20-1  What's that tell ya about the expectations?  And toronto won't get luongo, #1, price is stupid high to get him. #2, he doesn't wanna play in toronto and has reportedly taken them off his list of teams to accept a trade too.  Problem solved, go with the 2 young, good, capable goalies u have, keept ur draft picks and prospects, build on ur defense, try to replace luke schenn on the back end, hope JVR can play 82 games and contribute something and work on getting a scoring center for the top 6, and see what the kids can do"
