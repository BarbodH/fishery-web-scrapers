712409,mercman,2012-07-07 02:57:00,7054,I think i got her beat. Caught a 6 inch walleye tonite Im sure the pic will be up soon enough
712410,Canuck2fan,2012-07-07 03:02:00,1444,If you were taking pictures who poured water over the reel to keep the gears from burning up? LOL
712414,nroadrunner,2012-07-07 03:30:00,113,A smart man would have told her that was 8 inches  .  All kidding aside hopefully she is bitten by the fishing bug.  My wife loves to fish which is great.   Ian
