Phenominal fishing.... honestly it was like fly-in type of fishing, only the walleye were bass.  My main goal was to learn some techniques for my area of Erie.  He spent a lot of time teaching me some great new techniques and even some great boat control tips.  Biggest fish of the day was 4.5 pounds, but we caught tons pushing 4.  Anyone looking for a guide, I would not hesitate to recommend him!"
