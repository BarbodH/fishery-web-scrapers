I've done similar things in the past and never thought twice about it (giving people crap for tossing garbage on the ground).  I just want to make sure everyone is on the same page with one thing though, which was touched on earlier.  CIGARETTE BUTTS ARE TRASH! If you smoke, save your used butts in your pocket or ash tray and empty them out at a later time into a garbage can.  Do they smell? Yes, but that is your problem not mine or the environments. You choose to smoke, so choose to throw your garbage into a garbage can. Don't throw it onto the ground and step on it, don't try to grind it up under your foot so no one notices, don't flick it out your window (good way to cause a forest fire), don't make excuses.  Don't do it."

It's disgusting. I guess I haven't paid much attention to trash on my trips into Canada, but I remember as a boy Mom and Dad always remarking about the lack of litter, it was one of the things they admired about Canadians."

I was in a lineup at a Timmies drive through rescently and the guy right in front of me missed the garbage can and was stopped about 10' past it. He opened his window and proceeded to throw a pile of trash out onto the pavement. Even reaching into the back seat to grab stuff and add it to the pile.  Normally I'm not one to start anything, but that was just too much. I guess I kind of snapped, ultimately making the guy pick all his stuff up and put it in the garbage can 10' away.  People waiting in line around me were clapping LOL!  When I got to the drive through window they'd seen and heard the entire altercation and my order was on the house.  Mike Borger urban hero."

So when I go out to cut my grass I have to pick it up first or I get filtered try again please all over my lawnmower tires. This has been going on for years and finally I noticed her coming out of her driveway one day as I was driving by. Right on now I know where she lives. In early june I picked up a bag and delivered it to her front step one evening. I taped a note to it that said"" I believe this belongs to you, I am the guy on the corner by the beach where your dog relieves himself when you walk him"" She no longer walks on my side of the street when she passes by"
712007,lew,2012-07-05 21:18:00,12766," Years ago my old pal Andy had a very miserable neighbor who hated absolutely everybody she ever knew.  Andy also had a very tiny dog that never left his property.  One day the old lady came out the front door and found a very big pile of doggy doo on the front lawn. She was outraged and scooped it up with a shovel and tossed the doo over the fence onto Andy's front lawn.  Andy screamed at her and asked ""what the hell are you doing lady"" ?? to which she replied, ""that mess must belong to you as I don't have a dog""  Andy was a pretty laid back guy and said nothing more but just waited his turn.  Andy had no trees on his property but the old girl had 2 massive oak trees, one in the front yard and one in the backyard.  As Autumn approached all the leaves began to fall and as always, 1/2 of them ended up on Andy's property. As he always did, he raked them up and filled about a dozen big bags with leaves, then set them aside and waited.  Over several days he watched the old girl rake her leaves from her side, then haul all the bags to the curb for pick-up.  After the garbage truck left, Andy methodically took all his bags next door to her nice clean lawn and began dumping them all over the ladies property.  She eventually saw what he was doing and came  storming out of the house screaming and asking what the hell he was doing.  Andy calmly said, ""these leaves must belong to you lady, cause I don't have any trees""  I miss my old pal Andy, he was a pretty kool dood !!"

So for those that don't know, don't LITTER!"

712214,JoshS,2012-07-06 15:46:00,729,"I think we've all seen it way to many times. I wish the culprits would get what they deserve. Nothing is worse then litterers, especially in the country."
712216,lew,2012-07-06 15:49:00,12766," There's not garbage everywhere in the Kawarthas, infact 99% of the area is beautiful and very clean, it just seems to be a small percentage of the spots that have the garbage problem.  It's been my experience after a lifetime of fishing this region, that the worst place for the pigs to throw their garbage is the places where  folks fish from shore, or else the free boat ramps like the causeway on Chemong. The vast majority of ""pay as you use"" boat ramps are kept clean."

712223,John,2012-07-06 16:11:00,2956," I think that is an unfair generalization. The Kawartha's like other regions, Haliburton and Muskoka included, each have their slobs, but thankfully still in the minority."

I was blown away by the amount of garbage all along the shoreline. All fishing related garbage. The locals have 2, 1 day river cleanups after freshet and the amount of garbage is awfull, were talking tons. Everyone blames everyone else about the litter problem. The locals say it the people from Vancouver. I talked to alot of locals on the flow and watched some of them walk away and leave their empty roe containers and other crap behind."

Started a thread last year, after watching a guy (older gentleman, not a kid) open his packaging in the Walmart parking lot...then just drop it on the ground.  Moments later a young couple pulled up, he removes a Timmies cup from his vehicle, and drops it on the ground.  By this point I had enough, walked over to his vehicle, picked up the cup and put it under his windshield wiper...hopefully it made him think (although I doubt it)!  So, it isn't just anglers.

Once nobody is looking, they fling the bag.  I've got a friend who saw this happening repeatedly near his house, so he gathered up all the bags-o-doo and returned them to their rightful owner.

These   go through the effort of putting there garbage in a bag but when they leave the camp they leave all the bags behind thinking that the garbage man is going to fly in on his magic helicopter and pick up the bags and of course the local critters/varment rip the bags apart as well making it even worse !!! I was just at a remote camp a couple weeks ago and someone threw a garbage bag full of about 100 beer cans in the fire pit and lit it up , well the bag melted away but the 100 beer cans were left in the fire pit for the next guy (me) to pick up .

711910,CRUD150,2012-07-05 14:43:00,87,  For real?  No not perfect. But alot of responisble people at least try. I bring a bag along when hiking/river fishing and always ty to pick up some of the trash people have left behind. Now my eight year old son does the same when he is with me.
711914,Squid,2012-07-05 14:54:00,1656,"Yes for real Crud, you  would be surprised how many people complain about people throwing grabage and yet they do the same.

I never dropped a pop can or similar piece of non-biodegradable garbage on the ground. Even when I was 5 years old I knew this was wrong and would keep my garbage until I found a garbage can.  Do you think it is okay to just toss your garbage on the ground.
711942,Luke V.,2012-07-05 15:53:00,286,"i see this all the time at our local launch. People seem to think that becasue they pay to launch means they can leave behind their garbage. This really isnt ok. However there should be garbage cans placed in public places like the launch. This launch seems to be missing the garbage can everytime im there. Still not having a garbage can does not give anyone an excuse to litter. I actually caught my buddy doing this last weekend. Had him out on the boat after we came back in he had some garabge (worm container, bottle of water etc) and he just threw it under my truck after we packed up. I wouldnt leave till he picked up the garbage. I told him to throw it in my truck and I would get rid of it at home. (however i was not so polite to him)  Bottom line is people are ignorant, and my generation does not give a rats ass about anything. They think they own the world and that everything relvolves around them. Sometimes I'd like to give some people a smack, and tell them to have some respect. But that won't end well im sure.   Ways to improve: I always carry a garbage bag, plactic bag with me in my truck. If you see some garabage around pick it up, find a public garbage can and dispose of it.   Rant over.  Luke"
711953,bubbles,2012-07-05 16:22:00,591,"  Exactly.  We were camping this past weekend and I was explaining this very thing to my son ""take nothing but pictures, leave nothing but footprints""  I was very proud when I heard him explaining it to his cousin the next day.  Besides picking up after the ignorant this is another way we can help."
711967,bigbuck,2012-07-05 17:19:00,2449,"All it takes is to pick up after yourself and to pick up one or two other pieces of trash and you will be able to see a big improvement in our environment. People that are lazy, and I used to be one should not leave a mess everywhere they go, plain and simple. There are plenty of trash receptacles all over the place, USE THEM!!! As for dog owners that don't pick up after their dogs, they are boneheads as well, it takes one second to reach down and scoop it up. If I don't have a bag with me, I go back to get it."
