712325,danbouck,2012-07-06 20:36:00,4380," the pee up is this weekend, Friday the 13th the following"
712326,dave524,2012-07-06 20:39:00,4508," OMG, that what happens when you are retired, not only do you not know what day it is, I'm having trouble with weeks now"

711395,Pigeontroller,2012-07-04 00:20:00,2793,"Any recomendations on whats the best place to launch to fish Long Point? I don't need cememt and a dock either, I'd rather use a less than perfect ramp and avoid the crowds...Waited at Crystal Beach to load for near 30 minutes in a line-up of 10-15 boats Monday..."
711405,Live2fish85,2012-07-04 00:36:00,1633,I usually launch in Port Rowan. Alot less traffic and you are in the inner bay. I found the launch at the provincial park to be a bit busy as well as some along the way.
711407,snackpack5150,2012-07-04 00:44:00,79,I have used the old cut out at Long point not a bad launch and very close to the perch grounds. Hope this helps  Ken
711408,smally21,2012-07-04 00:45:00,993,"i use booths harbour mostly, never busy, easy run to ec10 or pottohawk. fin and feather is right next door havent used theirs dont know if its available to public  if you drive around to longpoint itself there are 3 launches at marinas there..a little cheaper but it is quite a bit further to drive and id rather be in the boat than the truck."
711412,danbouck,2012-07-04 00:54:00,4380,Old cut is best imo
711417,SRT8 smoker craft,2012-07-04 01:00:00,1107,I have a seasons pass at the PP only time I ever wait is when a inexperienced boater decides to load their boat on the ramp or someone decides to drive their brand new RAM down the ramp to boost their dead battery (saw that this weekend ) its usually pretty slow I find not much traffic
711424,Pigeontroller,2012-07-04 01:13:00,2793,Where and what is old cut?
711430,danbouck,2012-07-04 01:20:00,4380, It's on Roger's ave in Long Point

711453,hotsky,2012-07-04 01:40:00,400,  Next time I will go to Sandboy Marina.
711457,danbouck,2012-07-04 01:43:00,4380," Sorry to hear, Ray and Sue have been nothing short of fantastic to me my whole life."
711493,ch312,2012-07-04 03:47:00,1590," odd. i think you'd be hard pressed to find another person with the same opinion as yours. i've always been met with smiles and don't have a single complaint after buying minnows, snacks, and launching there 15-20 times.  i could be wrong, but me thinks you're somehow associated with sandboy after reading your post  :spam:"
711497,hotsky,2012-07-04 04:34:00,400,"Lol, just shearing my experience. I had a friend with me that can prove it... Never spent a dime at Sandboy actually and don't know anyone there either, but will be renting a boat from them in a couple of weeks.  Edit: old cut had better prices and is located at a better spot, which why I went there first. But if someone doesn't want my money I simply won't go there."
711510,krixxer,2012-07-04 10:41:00,274,Shady Akers is 15$ and has live bait
711556,Broker,2012-07-04 13:38:00,482,"I find long point PP isn't usually that busy if you go early in the morning or a night, id just avoid being there mid day"
711840,ch312,2012-07-05 03:48:00,1590," well, i did say ""i could be wrong"" and apparently i was. i guess there is a first for everything    :D  i'm not looking for each marinas prices, but what kinda prices have you been finding for renting boats?"
711853,Rich,2012-07-05 10:21:00,3927,"Tp, booths, akers, sandboy, marina shores, old cut, the provincial park.. All decent ramps. Port rowan slightly trickier, but also generally a good ramp. I launch based on the area i plan to fish. Bring 20 bucks as that is the going rate for most ramps on the bay nowadays."
711854,Rich,2012-07-05 10:21:00,3927,Oh and booths / old cut i find the busiest on the bay.
711939,Alumacraft,2012-07-05 15:44:00,139,Dax what were you expecting the Crystal beach launch to be empty on the long weekend.
711940,skinny,2012-07-05 15:47:00,442,there is  place just before the old cut livery called Post Marine I launch there most of the time ramp is smooth 10.00 to launch it also has a deep spot to power on to the trailer if you load that way.  Randy has always been great with me I run some old equipment and he has always helped me out if need be.
711944,BillM,2012-07-05 15:58:00,17367,I doubt Crystal Beach would be packed during a normal weekday.  Anyone launching on the holiday Monday should have expected long wait times.
712082,Pigeontroller,2012-07-06 02:20:00,2793,"Jeez, I just asked about launches at Long Point...I've been launching at Crystal beach since I was teenager...I know what its like there..."
712198,dave524,2012-07-06 14:58:00,4508,"Long Point launches might be especially busy this weekend, think this is the weekend of the big Pottohawk Party, well past the age of participating but a wild time in my younger years"
712299,SRT8 smoker craft,2012-07-06 19:27:00,1107,  Yep the P up is this sunday
