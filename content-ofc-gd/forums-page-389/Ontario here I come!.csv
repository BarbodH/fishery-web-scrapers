710095,mepps,2012-06-28 18:57:00,1301,"Hey guys, I'm glad to report I'll be moving back to Ontario in August! I'm looking forward to fishing with many of you again!  I am looking for a place near High Park in Toronto so I can be close to my beloved TO pike! Glad that fishing ban has been lifted!  Clive"
710099,Hooked,2012-06-28 19:10:00,891,Excellent news!  Looking forward to seeing some of your reports again.  Btw how's the fishing been treating you on the east coast?
710102,Spiel,2012-06-28 19:17:00,9065,"It'll be nice to have you back local Clive.  Hope all is well and also hope that you'll provide us with some local reports again, not to mention the possibility of a G2G."
710104,misfish,2012-06-28 19:17:00,29133,Clive.did you get knocked on the head? LOL  Welcome back.
710108,TennesseeGuy,2012-06-28 19:37:00,957,"Hey Clive, meet me at the Outlet around noon August 11 to pick up a few walleyes for a Table Rock shorelunch."
710112,highdrifter,2012-06-28 19:54:00,2534, Brah I was just looking at places in High Park.  We could end up being neighbours!!
710137,Slop,2012-06-28 21:39:00,151,Unleash the fury!
710151,Christopheraaron,2012-06-28 23:17:00,3525,I'm sorry if this offends anyone but I take nova scotia over ontario any day of the week!
710156,lew,2012-06-28 23:27:00,12766, C ya
710160,Christopheraaron,2012-06-28 23:34:00,3525,"sorry, over richmond hill."

710232,solopaddler,2012-06-29 10:19:00,8605,"Hey, that's good news for the rest of us! Welcome back."
710395,SlowPoke,2012-06-29 19:55:00,2984,Yay! Maybe we can hook up again to rescue more aircraft! 
710545,Joey,2012-06-30 15:05:00,9122,Great news Clive.  Will be nice to have you back
711639,mepps,2012-07-04 18:28:00,1301,"Thanks guys! I will definitely miss this slower pace here in NS, but I'm looking forward to catching carp, largies, walleye, pike and muskie again!  I've really enjoyed the 5 years I've been out east! The scenery is great and having the ocean nearby is amazing! You really gotta work for your fish here...well work for the big ones anyway, they are few and far between!  Slowpoke - that was a great day on the water despite the lack of fish! HD - just got a place about 4 km west of High Park, just off Dundas W - minutes from the humber!  TG - Don't tempt me!! I've got a wedding to attend in Peterborough on that day!"
711643,Christopheraaron,2012-07-04 18:31:00,3525," Ya you have to work for them, but a great place none the less, we're leaving for our annual trip to wolfville in a few weeks. Did you ever try striped bass?"
711686,mepps,2012-07-04 20:19:00,1301,"I only got out a couple of time for striped bass, didn't get any unfortunately. I didn't take full advantage of all of the species here"
711688,Christopheraaron,2012-07-04 20:23:00,3525,Where'd you try? I go to the mouth of the gaspreau and am almost guaranteed a nice fish every time. Hey you still have another month.
712107,motv8tr,2012-07-06 05:36:00,2587,"Hey Clive it will be good to have you back in TO, I'll look forward to your reports....and Congrats on finding a place close to where you wanted to be, not always an easy thing to do  Maureen"
712166,Victor,2012-07-06 13:19:00,1609,Welcome back! Loved your reports back in the day.   Peterborough!? How sick would it be to see a dude double fisting bass in a suit?
712495,Fisherpete,2012-07-07 15:40:00,1814,"Hey Clive, welcome back! If you want to chase some esox or anything else that swims when you get here let me know, always a seat for you in my boat!  Pete"
