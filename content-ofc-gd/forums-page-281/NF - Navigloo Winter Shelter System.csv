808700,John Bacon,2013-09-21 04:54:00,3277,Does anyone have a any experience with Navigloo systems for outdoor storage?  I have generally built my own supports and put a tarp over it.  But Costco has a good deal on these so I was considering picking one up.  They look like a great system; it would be great to hear from someone with first hand experience.  http://www.navigloo.com/product/fishing-boat-shelters.html   
808722,walleyejack,2013-09-21 15:10:00,358,"i built my own with central vac tubing and some abs fittings. probably cost me less than $50 bucks,  didn t feel like spending 500 on the system and a cheap tarp from princess auto."
808723,John Bacon,2013-09-21 15:34:00,3277,"Thanks, I wouldn't spend $500 on either but Costco has it for $289.  I am surprised that you could get all of that tubing plus fittings for under $50.  Where is the best place to purchase these items?"
808780,farsider,2013-09-21 20:21:00,456,"I was thinking it would be pretty easy as well.  Lee Valley sells some unique PVC connectors that should make it simple.  You could glue up one side of the 'A' frame and have the other side hinged or dry-fit to collapse for off-season storage.  http://www.leevalley.com/en/garden/page.aspx?p=67332&cat=2,66758  Cheers, Mark"
808786,mike rousseau,2013-09-21 21:13:00,4661,I built my own frame from PVC...  And use the boat cover I got with my boat...  No issues...  Just clean the snow off if it's heavy or thick....
808872,John Bacon,2013-09-22 14:21:00,3277," Thanks, which size PVC did you use?  I checked the Lee Valley link above and the largest I saw was 1"".  I am not confident that 1"" pipe would be strong enough."
808907,mike rousseau,2013-09-22 18:03:00,4661,I forget the actual size... 2 inch I think....  Home Depot had everything I needed...
808982,GYPSY400,2013-09-23 01:04:00,191,I built mine from 2x3's.. 10 of them..and a tarp from princes auto
