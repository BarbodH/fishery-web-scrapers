808728,Terry,2013-09-21 16:27:00,14456,"ok first let me say I blame Misfish for putting the idea in my head but however it happened I said something about it to my wife, she decided to get it for my birthday not for couple of months but she likes to buy early  now she figures I should try it out before she puts it away  I did not know it would be so heavy I read about the size but did not know  it was so big  I don't think it would fit in a trunk...takes up a lot of room in my jeep, and I do have the roof racks  but any how.....now I have to give it a try sunday if the rain holds off   and blowing it up...I need to find the best pump for that too      look out world  ,here I come  or orr"
