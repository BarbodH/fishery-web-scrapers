I don't have the cash to get a true pin right now, but was considering converting a fly reel. I've found a couple reels at a decent price that are big enough to use, but before I commit I want to know what the process is for stripping a reel down. So can any of you who have done this explain exactly how much work is involved? Thanks!"
808765,kickingfrog,2013-09-21 19:37:00,8333,"For all that, I wonder if a spinning reel with a nice drag or a baitcaster might be an easier stopgap?"
808769,Christopheraaron,2013-09-21 19:51:00,3525,"I have both of those, but it isn't as smooth."
808772,kickingfrog,2013-09-21 20:00:00,8333,"Smooth drag? Or smooth free spool? A spinning reel spool can be ""palmed"" for drag and use an open bail for the drift. A baitcaster can be thumbed and the cast control can be backed off and the line fed by hand. Neither are as good as a float reel but I would think both might be better then buying a fly reel and converting it."
808775,misfish,2013-09-21 20:06:00,29133,"  Chris. The combo I just bought,was for those colder days and I can get away with wearing mittens. Long river rod with a nice smooth ABU bait caster. I know it will work well. Been watching alot of the west coast you tube stuff. Thats why I bought it..  This combo is lighter then I thought. Cant wait to use it."

808819,Christopheraaron,2013-09-22 01:48:00,3525,"Thanks Bluegill, I'm looking at a few reels now, but that one you posted looks pretty good. Do you find the line gets caught between the spool and frame a lot? I don't really want to carry a screwdriver with me."

808866,spinnerdoc,2013-09-22 13:41:00,556,With regards to your question fly reels esp. The cheaper ones don't use the same bearings than the ones used on a float reel. The one I had used roler bearings (dowels) housed in a plastic case. So you might have to bore out the journal to accomodate the appropriate bearings. I did not measure so I am only guessing youll have to. If your lucky and they have the right kind of bearing you can modify or change them. So could be a lot of work and not nbe as good as the real thing. Looks like Bluegill got the solution for you. I'd look into used cp and see what you can dig up.
