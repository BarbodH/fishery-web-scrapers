807966,Tayzak15,2013-09-16 17:18:00,318,Luckily where I live were allowed to target them with a catch and release policy. Me and my buddy's fish for them from mid-late august right until the end of october and always do well (catching anywhere from 10-20 in a day). For people that want to kill them just for the meat SHAME ON YOU!  These fish are the kings of freshwater fish and should be treated that way. It is a privilege to say you've caught one and have the opportunity to fight one. The least you can do is release it to let somebody else catch it someday.
807996,jimmer,2013-09-16 19:56:00,2730,"Anyone that eats a fish that old should change their eating habits!  So, the MNR has a mandate to make sure native species continue to survive (I support this), however, they are not there to ensure that there are healthy fish populations for anglers to harvest, but yet the anglers are the ones that pay for this? Hmmm don't know if that makes sense, but it sounds like what I'm reading."
808020,manitoubass2,2013-09-16 21:22:00,11391,Smoked sturgeon is delicious. Typically small fish are used to smoke ie 10-15 lbs so there not too old.
808027,Christopheraaron,2013-09-16 21:48:00,3525,just out of curiosity is it possible to catch them on lures?
808045,manitoubass2,2013-09-16 23:44:00,11391,Jig and a grub will catch them. Never heard of one taking a lure though

808121,fishindevil,2013-09-17 07:58:00,6254,I have caught a few sturgeon trolling worm harnesses along the bottom in current with bottom bouncers !!!! Same as big channel cats Chris we get them trolling as well ....like mike says the Larry & Ottawa rivers  have lots of big ones I have seen them jump and roll too !!!! Amazing to see !!!! Love to get one on camera jumping !!!

805022,dhickey,2013-08-26 03:28:00,1038,Its not about pillage and plunder. Its about conserving a resource that is native to Ontario and that my friend is the goal of MNR .  I back the MNR  100% simply because they at least try to find solutions to depleting native fish stocks.  Stocking lakes with fish that are not native is a circle  of failure. It can and does disrupted the ecology of a lake with repercussions that  can be detrimental to a lake or river.  Catch and release works!!! I just wish Ontario would adopt a trophy lake system.(0 fish kept) in more  lakes and rivers/ not just sanctuaries.  Don.

805045,porkpie,2013-08-26 12:19:00,2521,Glad to hear of some success in the program.  I continue to hear of greater and greater numbers of Sturgeon entering the Notty.  I remember a guy caught one near the mouth 25 years ago and at that time it was an EVENT!  I support succesful reintroductions of native species.  When it comes to throwing millions down the rabbit hole on an unsuccessful venture over a period of more than 20 years (cough.. atlantics.... cough) I agree they should switch gears and move the funds to a more succesful program.
805047,BillM,2013-08-26 12:20:00,17367,"I haven't had the luxury of being bumped into by one of these monsters yet while waist deep in the Notty, but I sure look forward to it"

805077,manitoubass2,2013-08-26 15:15:00,11391,Oily but good smoked. You can only eat abit before you'll be running for a washroom

The First Nations in my area put out set lines for them and sell smoked sturgeon...,  I have a friend that is great at smoking... He has stopped me on the water to give me some....

805110,davey buoy,2013-08-26 19:21:00,5505,Nice catch Love to accidently catch one if only for the fight.Watching too many fishing shows lol.
805114,fishindevil,2013-08-26 19:47:00,6254,I'm glad that they are protected I have caught a few while walleye fishing the Ottawa river and we were asking almost 20yrs ago up in the Ottawa river district to have it closed and nobody listened the MNR In pembroke said they were considering it and did nothing for years !!!!! I saw them caught and left to die and treated like they were a garbage fish !!!!! I see a few and catch the odd one now and agin so I'm hoping they are protected for along time as its gonna take years to get the numbers back as they do not reach sexual maturity apparently till they are 20-25years old !!!!!! So it's gonna take some time no problem I can wait !!!!!! And yes they fight hard in the current with that big tail for sure.....
805122,manitoubass2,2013-08-26 20:24:00,11391,"Just down Down from my house I see catches quite often and some are comical to watch, pulling boats all around the river lol. They are so strong it's crazy! The big one I landed from shore took a little over an hour to get to shore. Caught it first cast and that was the end if my day lol. My shoulders and back just took a beating, as did my bass rod. I could feel the pressure right down to the reel seat. Incredible fish, I'd love to be able to catch and release one day"
807898,J-M,2013-09-15 22:52:00,65,"Hi Misfish, I helped run the sturgeon program with the Nottawasaga Conservation Authority a few years back. Not sure where you're getting your information from but the MNR isn't currently stocking Lake Sturgeon in Georgian Bay/Huron. Currently, the NVCA/MNR are monitoring there presence, mapping their spawning habitat and improving riparian habitat which indirectly improves habitat for species such as salmon and trout in the Notty. SO, actually, the fact that sturgeon are protected means there is more government funding to help imrpove the habitat in the Nottawasaga which will also help salmon/trout.  You need to understand the mandate of the MNR, its not about improving the populations of gamefish for anglers, its about bringing back native fish to their historic populations. Which I totally agree with...."
807901,glen,2013-09-15 23:19:00,2641,That's great info thank you. Can they use my lic money (that I buy so I can catch fish) to improve fish stocks?
807907,Dan668,2013-09-16 00:00:00,1120,"Seen a nice sturgeon, id estimate ~40 lbs sitting in the shallows over by Bone island in gbay today. Was a pretty cool sight."

807963,misfish,2013-09-16 15:46:00,29133," Thank you for your reply.  From what I took from the sign,(which is posted in Angus at the Notty) they were doing restoration and stocking . But maybe I read into it to much.  Thanks again."

I have heard stories of anglers wadding in the notty and getting their legs bumped and bruised from these guys. I believe they are so cool,but like said,WHY? Cant fish for them,they are protected. Guess maybe like the Doves were protected for so many years ,they now are open to hunt once again,since they have rebounded so well.  BTW,Doves taste great. Just like Quail."
804925,BillM,2013-08-25 19:29:00,17367,"They aren't stocking them for consumption or sport, they are trying to establish a self sustaining population in Gbay/Huron.    Once they do, maybe they'll open up a season for them."

804927,misfish,2013-08-25 19:36:00,29133,My question is WHY? Moneys spent on a fish we cant fish for or take for consumption.   What the reason behind this?
804933,Dutch,2013-08-25 19:45:00,831,"They are trying to re-establish a self-sustaining population so that one time in the future, they can maybe open up a season for them.  Great endeavour if you ask me."

We never kept any and I don't know anyone that did so why do they have to stock them now? Is the environment not a good one for them?  Oh, and I agree, the money would be better spent on stocking other species or protecting the fisheries that do exist."
804948,BillM,2013-08-25 20:34:00,17367," You cannot target sturgeon in southern Ontario.   If you're actually fishing for them, you're breaking the law."
804949,MJL,2013-08-25 20:36:00,2427,"From my understanding, the lake sturgeon was once super plentiful throughout the great-lakes. They were by-catch for commercial fishermen and their nets would often be destroyed while trying to get them out – They were slaughtered and left to rot on shore. Once commercial fishermen realized that caviar was popular, numbers further plummeted. Dams blocking migration routes up river and environmental degradation have also taken their toll on sturgeon numbers everywhere. It takes many years for sturgeon to reach sexual maturity. Stocking sturgeon makes absolute sense to me. It would be my first species of choice as something to stock our waters with in this day and age (despite not being able to fish for them)."
804951,manitoubass2,2013-08-25 20:44:00,11391,"I literally have sturgeon in mass quantities  100 yards from my house. The numbers here are staggering. I never have targeted them, but I've watched a lot of people do it. And the MNR is present. They don't seem to care as long as its catch and release. Then again, I'm on the us border, and maybe it legal for them?  In 5 years, I've caught two incidental sturgeon, and I must say the fight is like no other. One was about ten lbs ice fishing, the other was 80-100lbs, that I had to walk into the water to release. I wish I coulda took pics, but by the book, that's illegal"
804953,Rich,2013-08-25 20:48:00,3927,"The answer is simple : so one day, we can fish for them."
804954,MCTFisher9120,2013-08-25 20:53:00,3761,"Because older generations have abused a species yet again. Native species deserve to be here. It's the Ministry of Natural Resources job to do there best to keep our lakes, fish, animals well here for us to target, catch or release, hunt and well enjoy. I see no problem in seeing species come back to ""normal"" levels....money spent on trucks, gas, parties, or pretty signs, is a waste...creating new life for a particular fish and well years of enjoyment for future anglers is great. Maybe our kids will be able to enjoy a productive Sturgeon fishery one day in the mix of great bass, pike, walleye and all the other game fish we have these days. Atlantic Salmon is another that yes people are catching on Lake Ontario. Something 10 years ago may of been impossible to see. Money is money and it's going to be spent. It's a thing with no meaning. Spend it make the world better. A fish is a fish, the more out there the better"
804959,danc,2013-08-25 21:05:00,4677," I've seen them in the river right from the paper mill. Awesome sight. I also remember going to a bar in International Falls that had dozens and dozens of photos on the wall of guys holding massive Sturgeon. Sportsmans bar maybe? There's a river a few hundred yards from my house that has a good population of Sturgeon as well, but I've never targeted them there, even before the regs changed. The only one I've ever caught was in the Winisk River, which flows into Hudson Bay. I remember seeing dozens of them in a single pool up there. Some of them were almost a foot across the back and 6 or 7 feet long. An incredible sight."
804970,fishindevil,2013-08-25 22:03:00,6254,For one reason it can take them 25 years of age before tey even spawn once !!!!! And can go several years in between them spawning again!!!and they were a native species
805001,Musky or Specks,2013-08-26 01:25:00,2710,"Very short sighted opinion IMHO. Fish have a value outside of whether or not you can angle for them. They are part of a ecological chain that has existed for millions of years until we showed up and decimated their population with harvest and environmental degradation. You can't shoot peregrine falcons yet they ""waste"" money reintroducing them to downtown Toronto. Fisherman despite this boards egocentric opinion are not the only users of the environment.

805011,lhousesoccer,2013-08-26 02:17:00,442," I was reading down through this thread, hoping to see someone provide this response, and finally I did.  Thanks Musky.  I couldn't agree more.  IMO, it's an odd attitude for people to have, thinking that if they can't use something, or that that ""something"" doesn't provide a direct benefit to them, then it's not of value.  The place and purpose of any species on this planet, whether it's fish, plant, or animal, has so many more far-reaching and multi-faceted values than just whether it can tug on someone's line or wind up as someone's dinner, and it's a shame that so many are blind to that.  It's that attitude that is a root cause of widespread habitat and species loss worldwide, whether it's Toronto and other urban centres chewing up thousands of acres of farmland to urban sprawl every year, or slashing and burning Brazilian rainforest to pump out beef for the McDonald's machine.  If people fail to see the inherent value in the sheer existence of natural, wild ecosystems and the creatures that inhabit them, and they only see what can be provided directly to them for their benefit, then no wonder species decline and habitat loss are no big deal to most of the world's population, right?  Big deal - it's just a swamp.  Big deal - it's just some trees.  Big deal, it's just some fish that I can't catch.  The restoration, conservation, and protection of all organisms, for the plain purpose of ensuring their continued survival in this world, to continue providing all of the ecological and intangible roles and values they serve is something we should all strive to support.  And yes - this is coming from someone who ate a 17"" smallmouth bass for dinner tonight, caught by me fresh this afternoon.  As John Muir wrote .... ""When we try to pick out anything by itself, we find it hitched to everything else in the Universe.""  This quote has often been incorrectly misquoted as the following more commonly referenced statement: ""When one tugs at a single thing in nature, he finds it attached to the rest of the world.""  I actually find the latter usually resonates better with most people."
