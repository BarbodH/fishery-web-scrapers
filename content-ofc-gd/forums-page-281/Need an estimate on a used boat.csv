808681,danc,2013-09-21 01:02:00,4677,I'll just tell him that I own the back half. The half with the motor on it.
808690,HTHM,2013-09-21 02:34:00,4082,"Find a good divorce lawyer, He may end up giving you a monthly stipend...."
808692,muskymatt,2013-09-21 02:54:00,2608,"Seriously??  $8500???  This coming from the same guys who said a 20 boat with a 2 year old 115 etec with 3 year warranty,a 9.9 pro kicker with full controls, ipilot 80 24v, hds7, new Gal trailer with brakes and all the extras you could think about for only $8000-$10000.  For a 12 year old boat with a 60 four stroke bare bones. I'd say $6000 to start, with top price of $7500.  a few years back I bought a  17 princecraft with a 50Johnson on it, fully loaded with a new trailer for $4000.  I guess it's all what someone is willing to pay"
808695,nexstar,2013-09-21 03:31:00,63,Bring it to your closest marina and ask them how much they will take it for then add 25 to 30% on top of their price. My guess is around $7000. Does it come with any electronics or trolling motor? Those can affect the selling price significantly.  Good luck with the sale.
808696,danc,2013-09-21 03:40:00,4677,"There is no trolling motor, electronics, or closest marina. So 6 grand it is."
808815,ch312,2013-09-22 01:09:00,1590," I dunno about ""needing"" the max HP each boat is rated for. My G3 Angler (bow mount, 3 batteries, lots of gear) has a 90 on it and it gets up on plane very quick with two guys and a full livewell up front and it's rated for a 150. The only time i'd like a bit more power is when I have 4 people in the boat and i'm towing someone on the knee or wake board.  I think the aftermarket prop may have something to do with how quick it planes, but I'm not sure as I never tried the stock aluminum prop."
808820,BillM,2013-09-22 01:52:00,17367," A 20 year old boat is still a 20 year old boat no matter what kind of goodies you put on it, lol."
808824,danc,2013-09-22 02:48:00,4677," I've seen the ""you must max out your motor or you'll be sorry"" thing on here at least a million times. Unless you're a tourney guy where getting from point A to point B is critical, I disagree. I often fish with, or travel with 3 guys and gear in my rig and I get the same power up and top end speed as I do with only me in the boat. So I just don't get it either."
808830,SlowPoke,2013-09-22 03:37:00,2984,"Your boat appeals to a limited market, much like your hockey team. Dan's boat is more appealing to a larger market and has key words such as Lund and Four Stroke. Dan's boat is also much less likely to disappoint him in the spring, unlike your hockey team."
808831,SlowPoke,2013-09-22 03:48:00,2984,"It really depends on the boat. My boat is powered to 85% of its rating and I would really benefit from maxing out or beyond due to such a steep deadrise. Best I can do is 43.4mph because it's the equivalent of trying to keep a knife on plane. On the plus side, I can do 40+ in a 3' chop while sipping my coffee. As a rule of thumb, you're better off to max out and not need than to risk being underpowered. I didn't have an option when I bought mine because it was a non-current package deal. I can live with 43mph and keep $10k in my pocket."
808526,danc,2013-09-20 00:36:00,4677,"Need some help on pricing on a used boat guys. It's a 2001 Lund Pro Sport, 60 hp Merc 4 stroke. EZ Loader galvanized trailer with new spare tire. Custom cover about 6 or 7 years old. No real extras included. It's in excellent  mechanical shape. Visually it has some paint scratches and such. What would you pay for this rig??"
808527,walleyejack,2013-09-20 00:45:00,358,"seen a 2002 pro sport 16.75, 115 yam.  16900 on boat trader. if that helps you any."
808529,danc,2013-09-20 00:52:00,4677,"Thanks Jack, but that's a little more boat than the one I'm inquiring about. This one is rated for 90 hp max."
808533,landry,2013-09-20 01:00:00,1005,Look for it on the web. U will find similar in states. Add 3000 to the average American price is a good estimate.

808536,trevy727,2013-09-20 01:07:00,351,$7000
808537,danc,2013-09-20 01:12:00,4677,That's more like what I wanted to hear. Anyone else?? What do you base this on Trevy?
808544,Rizzo,2013-09-20 01:38:00,4754,"Used boats really hold their value especially if its a Lund and in good shape. I'm not a huge merc fan but I bet a boat like that would be worth maybe 8500. Too bad it doesn't have bowmount trolling motor or electronics because those will set you back another grand or more, also it sounds underpowered with a 60 on a boat rated for 90."
808545,danc,2013-09-20 01:42:00,4677,That's more good news. Actually the 2001 Merc is a Yahama. And the 60 hp is perfect for me. Thanks for you input Rizzo.
808564,ah_long,2013-09-20 03:20:00,354," I actually think that's a conservative estimate. I think this rig can fetch around $8500 given the Lund name.  Edit: if it's a Yammy, it should be somewhere around $9k"
808568,glen,2013-09-20 05:52:00,2641,Dan boats in your area are cheaper then southern ont and its the cheapest time of year. $7500 to $8500
808571,fishindevil,2013-09-20 10:16:00,6254,"if its rated for a 90hp max and its only got a 60hp,its still quite under powered and you will notice that for sure 2 guys with gear and tackle and gas trolling motor a few batteries...see where im going with this???  nothing worse than an under powered boat, i would always go with the max rated for the boat then its there when you need the power in my opinion you will regret  not having the extra get up and go that the boat was designed for..."
808579,BillM,2013-09-20 11:57:00,17367,I think the $8500 range sounds about right.
808584,mike rousseau,2013-09-20 12:50:00,4661,Agreed...  I paid $7000 for a 10 year old Lund... 16 foot... With a 40hp Honda 4 stroke... That was a few years ago... Galvanized trailer... Boat cover... Down rigger... Etc....
808611,bare foot wader,2013-09-20 16:44:00,1354,"I bought a 2000 lund 17' with 90 johnson, the usual scratches and 1 small dent but above the water line, pretty decent shape, at auction for 7,250 for hull and o/b, no extras....trailer paint was rough looking but solid, no issues, new tires....i bought in march, initially I didn' want to bid more than 6 or 6.5 but things happen....lol  if that boat has a 60, I'd definitely think you would find it under powered...and at this time of year I would start low on your offer"
808628,Lape0019,2013-09-20 18:52:00,647,"Helped my Dad purchase a 1994 lund pro angler 1700 with a 1993 75 suzuki 2 stroke on it for $5500 this year so I would think the $8500 figure would probably be pretty close to what to expect to pay. But as Glen said, it is the cheapest time of year to purchase a boat.  And I think what the OP is trying to say is that it is a Merc Motor that was built by Yanaha. My 2006 4 stroke is the last year they did that i beleive."
808632,davey buoy,2013-09-20 19:06:00,5505,"Dan seems to think the 60hp is no problem ,good for what he needs. Seems like pricing with that package is key"
808639,Lape0019,2013-09-20 19:35:00,647," Although it is a valid concern if you want the most performance out of your boat, I also don't find that to be a big deal.  My boat s rated for a 135 and has a 75 on the back of it. It hits 40 MPH with the right prop and only loses about 1mph with 3 people in it instead of just me..."
808643,aplumma,2013-09-20 20:28:00,6896,"DanC I would also say offer a low ball at this time of year and work on the price from there. I would also want to see it in the water and running before ice up. Good luck and I would offer $6,500.00 as a starting point.   Art"
808649,Rizzo,2013-09-20 21:23:00,4754,well if that merc is an undercover yami it sounds like a nice package
808652,trevy727,2013-09-20 21:36:00,351," I looked them up. Found a 2003 pro sport with a 90hp and it was going for 9500. Two years newer, 30 more HP. $7000 seemed reasonable. $8500 not so bad either. Good luck."
808654,frodobuggins,2013-09-20 22:01:00,127,8000$ Might be able to get a better price since you will have to store it for the winter.  I sold a car recently on Kijiji. I had a price in mind but it went for less. Things are only worth WHAT PEOPLE ARE WILLING TO PAY
808659,jonboy,2013-09-20 22:17:00,10,"Good and only choice to go with a Lund I would say without looking at it , $8000 to $9000 in Toronto area and $7000 to $8000 in Thunder Bay, try motor first"
808660,danc,2013-09-20 22:32:00,4677,"I should clarify something about this situation. I do know a little bit about the history of this package including it's performance level and maintainance records because I am a co owner of it and have been since it was bought new in 01. I am simply trying to buy my partner out and want to know what a reasonable offer will be. I have that info now, thanks to you guys. I think I'll low ball him and tell him that you guys said it was worth 6 grand. Whatever it's worth I'll only be paying half, since I already own the other half. Wish me luck."
808680,Rizzo,2013-09-21 00:45:00,4754,...haha ya until he googles it and finds this thread with everyone saying 8500...know how to delete a thread?
