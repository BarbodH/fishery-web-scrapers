806935,10point,2013-09-09 16:18:00,165,Not sure if Ontario has any of these wipers but I've been catching quite a few here in Indiana. Here is a big one I got yesterday.  
806936,Musky or Specks,2013-09-09 16:21:00,2710,"Jealous,no we don't have em. And I would love to catch one someday  Very nice fish BTW"
806937,BillM,2013-09-09 16:22:00,17367,Now that looks like fun!
806939,10point,2013-09-09 16:25:00,165,It has been fun. Catching them all on topwater lures. This fish broke my pole.
806944,Angler management,2013-09-09 16:39:00,280,"I saw very similar looking fish come out of lake Ontario, but im not familiar with the type of bass. Or could have been some variation of white bass/smallie. Friend showed me a pic a couple weeks ago of a 9lb fish that looked identical caught in GTA."
806952,quickme,2013-09-09 16:57:00,261,I use to catch those in Lake Ontario when I was a kid in the nuclear plant ( when you were still allowed in there)  Great fight and when you caught one there was more of them to follow.  never caught one that big thou.  Good looking fish.   nick
806959,Angler management,2013-09-09 17:13:00,280,"Ya i confirmed it was wiper he caught, also near powerplant few weeks ago. He got a few, largest being just over 9lbs. I will be going to give it a try for sure!"
806974,Joeytier,2013-09-09 18:45:00,3990,World record class wipers have been caught out of lake o within the last few years (not sure if it was an official record though).  Very cool fish.
807200,Rod Caster,2013-09-11 00:31:00,5784,Great catch indeed. I'd love to get into some of those...
807204,trevy727,2013-09-11 00:47:00,351,I'll be down in Indianapolis next week. Are you catching those anywhere close?
807354,10point,2013-09-11 20:05:00,165, The Dam at Lake Freeman just south of Monticello. About 1 1/2 hours from Indy.
807395,John Bacon,2013-09-11 23:26:00,3277, You were probably catching white bass.  A wiper is a white bass / striped bass hybrid.  There are a lot of white bass in Lake Ontario.  I have heard of some wipers caught in Lake Ontario as well; I don't think there is a large population of them though.
807415,trevy727,2013-09-12 01:36:00,351,Cool. Thanks
807426,Richie Razor,2013-09-12 02:57:00,536,Are they good eating? I've had saltwater stripers and they were delicious. Nice plump fish
807654,10point,2013-09-13 13:33:00,165,I have just started catching them this summmer and have only ate a  couple when the water was higher and I could get my boat in there. They are fine to eat. Anything fried in peanut oil and shore lunch batter is good.
807655,ehg,2013-09-13 14:01:00,2666,Really? Caught many 3-4 lb. white bass at nuke plant in Pickering. Haven't been there for few years. It would be super cool to get into a 9 lb. wiper if they are there now too. Wipers at Pickering? Is this true?
807686,rhymobot,2013-09-13 19:51:00,174,love the boilers hat. and love that fish. impressive. i just caught a similarly sized sheepshead. closest thing i've gotten to that fish you're holding.  this is what my boilers hat looks like. and this is the kind of fish you settle for when you need to scratch the itch after a long winter. not quite as nice as the beast you got. lol:  
807712,Angler management,2013-09-13 22:53:00,280,"Ya my buddy caught a few wipers a little while back this year. I have pic of a 9lb wiper from the plant in pickering, i would post it if i could figure out photobucket..."
808123,Joeytier,2013-09-17 09:59:00,3990,Yes i believe it was even featured in an ontario OOD.  I used to catch lots of what i thought were huge white bass in the 3 to 4 lb. range...thinking some of the bigger ones may have been wipers...or i've caught multiple world record white bass haha
