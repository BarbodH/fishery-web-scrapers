808442,danc,2013-09-19 02:17:00,4677,Looks like a fun day for the Rice Bros. I enjoyed that Rob.
808443,nexstar,2013-09-19 02:45:00,63,Nice.. poor smallie.

808448,Joey,2013-09-19 03:21:00,9122,"Cool, I love when that happens.  Confusing at first, but exciting to see when you finally realize what has happened.  Some nice fish there!!"

808474,mattyk,2013-09-19 16:25:00,2110,very cool! I had that happen with a smallie and I was able to land the musky on 6lb mono. It was very fun!
808477,kickingfrog,2013-09-19 16:53:00,8333,Ya my walleye jogging rod is a 6'6 crucial/1000 stratic with 15lb nanofil. T'was fun while it lasted.
808682,Rizzo,2013-09-21 01:14:00,4754,Wow that is a great story. I have had many beasts attack fish while ocean fishing but this has yet to happen for me while fishing in Ontario...maybe its because I go straight for the big guy in the first place. Glad to see you got some good fun out of the boat this year!
