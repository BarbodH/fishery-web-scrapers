808614,bobowski,2013-09-20 17:12:00,360,I am currently doing some research for an ice fishing trip this season. I would like to go to Lake Abitibi but I can't find any ice hut operators on the lake. Does anyone know of any hut rentals and accommodations on this lake? I heard there was a ice bungalow operator on this lake a few years ago but I heard he closed his business. Any help would be much appreciated. Thanks
