My dads, heavier but measured an inch shorter at 20"".    The smallmouth fishing was excellent as usual. You could catch tons pretty much anywhere on the lake. Only managed three musky, two off topwater. All were around 10lbs. Lost a big one which hit my lipless crank, boat side he shook it off. Too bad i didn't have my new Frabill Big Game net!!!  Labour day weekend, we hit Pigeon Lake. 5 muskies between me and my brother. Nothing of size. But fun nonetheless. All came off spinnerbaits fishing for bass off points in the north and casting in weeds in the southern portion. We surprisingly did very well with walleye. Managed around a dozen off lipless cranks near the islands in the north and gagnon narrows. All were within the slot/released as i dont keep any catch.  Last week we hit Gbay. Stupid amount of 1-2lb largies and hammer handles. Almost got sick of landing them lol. Cranks and spinnerbaits in 8-12 ft of water caught most. Brought out the new Calcutta D to toss around some double tens. Of course the only time i forget to figure 8, a musky is waiting boatside.. common occurrence with me. Was a odd day, lots of bigger pike would chase lures but not hit ~10-15lbs.  Tried for some smallmouth in deeper water. Managed a few 3-4lbs. Catches were spaced out, couldn't find any bigger schools yet.    I did see a nice sized sturgeon, sunbathing in the shallows. I tried to take a picture, but of course my friend just had to toss his spinnerbait at him which scared it off.  This week ill be trying my luck on Couchiching for the first time this year."
808667,danc,2013-09-20 22:57:00,4677,Nice. That one your Dad is holding is a brute!!
808673,Dan668,2013-09-20 23:14:00,1120,"Off course photobucket goes down when i tried to add more photos. Ah well, ill try to get back to them later. Thanks for reading."
808675,misfish,2013-09-20 23:20:00,29133,  Yes indeed he is. Fat piggie.
808685,MCTFisher9120,2013-09-21 01:29:00,3761,Very nice smallies thanks for sharing!
808702,mattyk,2013-09-21 09:51:00,2110,Some nice fish!
808732,JoshS,2013-09-21 17:04:00,729,"That's funny - I fished the same bodies of water recently, with the addition of balsam. Didn't do to well on Gbay tho, one follow in 2.5 days. Guess that's what it's all about. Just accidental pike and a nice walleye but no musky to be found. I really liked Restoule and Stormy being my first time up there. Got into a few there... and I lost what felt like a pig on Stormy, I did a no-mans cast and it hit a bulldawg in 40 feet. Nice lakes."
808735,limeyangler,2013-09-21 17:13:00,5204,nice bass for sure! (nice looking boat too  )
808755,Dan668,2013-09-21 19:09:00,1120,"Its a nice PP. If your new there, you may struggle to catch at first. I strictly fish stormy/clear when im up there. Gbay, anywhere in honey harbour will net you tons of pike and small bass, the big ones are hit and miss."
808756,Dan668,2013-09-21 19:15:00,1120,"Cool shot of the rig from the water    The other, is a friend whom i introduced to fishing. He now owns his own tackle and gear and loves getting out.  Boat/Truck. Love the boat, but already want a bigger boat, have a 21 glass boat in mind when i finally finish uni in the next 2 years.    Brother with a small ski, im pretty sure everyone can guess that spot.    Brother with the WGSF, wouldnt be a complete report without it  "
808794,Sour_Squirrel,2013-09-21 22:40:00,196,"I was fishing out in Honey Harbour last Saturday and didn't do that good.  It was my first time there.  Only managed three Bass - two Smallmouth and one Largemouth.  All of them were small; about a pound each.  The two Smallmouth were caught using a drop shot rig over 14-16 feet of water.  Close to the area with the ""bullseye"" painted on the rock. The one Largemouth was caught on a Bomber squarebill casting over a large weed flat about 6-8 feet deep adjacent to the boat channel.  Tried casting crankbaits, jerk baits and spinnerbaits for Pike in the weed flats, along weed edges and along drop offs just outside of weed flats. Not a single bite.  Not a Pike to be seen. I blamed it on the cold front that had passed last weekend.  Do you think I was fishing the wrong areas??"
808801,Dan668,2013-09-21 23:20:00,1120,I was out Sunday during the cold front. We boated over 50 bass/pike. Ill shoot you a pm when i come back tomorrow evening.
