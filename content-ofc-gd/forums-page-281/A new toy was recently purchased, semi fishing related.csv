807988,chris.brock,2013-09-16 19:29:00,4053,"  a 16', Souris River Prospector, in ultra light Kevlar, it weighs a claimed 42 lbs  we bought it used from the Portage Store, it's pretty beat up, that's fine because it's going to get even more beatings from it's new owner   on the topic of canoes, I bought this cheap off Kijiji a few years ago, and hope to convert it into a light, back lake portage boat, I haven't got around to it yet    it's some kind of racing canoe, with the high seat/ center of gravity, it's as tippy as hell, paddles fast though  "
807989,davey buoy,2013-09-16 19:32:00,5505,"Nice catch!!,I also found the Grumans,mind you heavier,but the high up seats,sure made you behave yourself.Tippy as well."
808016,aplumma,2013-09-16 21:04:00,6896,Nice catch Chris  kevlar is the bomb when you need light and durable. The racing canoe for me is nothing but a quick trip to a swimming opportunity.    Art
808021,leaf4,2013-09-16 21:23:00,2466,weighs less than half of my scanoe! with that racing one I'd be putting the seat on the floor haha
808022,chris.brock,2013-09-16 21:26:00,4053,"   yeah, it's brutal, I only go for a paddle when the weather and water are warm, and I'm in my bathing suit  exactly!, when I get around to it, that seat is gone, and a yoke goes in"
808029,gogu392,2013-09-16 22:00:00,142,"Try a fishing kayak like Hobie, Wildernes. A lot more stable and smaller."
808032,chris.brock,2013-09-16 22:34:00,4053," yeah, I hear ya, they're heavy and hard to carry though  the racing canoe caught my eye because it weighs 20 to 25lbs, perfect for bushwacking into lakes that don't have portages"
808035,kickingfrog,2013-09-16 22:40:00,8333,"You think that is tippy, try an olympic type racing canoe. I didn't unclench my cheeks the entire time."
808039,chris.brock,2013-09-16 23:21:00,4053," remember ""the real art of conversation"" KF, a little too much information there, hahaha"
808105,Sinker,2013-09-17 03:54:00,8692,Nice!!
808111,Moosebunk,2013-09-17 04:03:00,3970,Good pick-up Chris.  Somewhere under a pile of dust and hay in a friend's Mother's old barn is a fiberglass canoe of mine.  Reminiscent of days when I was fit. lol.
