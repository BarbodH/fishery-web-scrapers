774403,Big Cliff,2013-03-18 19:49:00,6899,"Just a bit of an up date.I got to have a bit of lunch with Pikeslayer last Friday. There isn't much to report on Sean's condition, I guess guardedly optomistic is about the best way to put it. There are some very minor changes but boy it is slow! Little steps that make you want to hope but at the same time you are afraid to hope for too much.There is a chance that Sean could be transfered back to the GTA in the next 6-8 weeks which would be a big help to the family. Lets give those prayers and good thoughts another shot of Viagra (for you young guys that is just like thinking of a hot girl walking into the bar and locking her eyes on you) (for us older guys it's a little blue pill).Anyway the whole family is going to need our continued love and support so lets keep it up!"
774409,lew,2013-03-18 20:09:00,12766,Thanks for the up-date Cliff.  It'll be great when they can get Sean closer to home.
774410,davey buoy,2013-03-18 20:29:00,5505,"Again best wishes,I'm sure things will get better!"
774423,Rich Clemens,2013-03-18 21:56:00,3131,The little steps add up over time.  At least it sounds like Sean is moving in the right direction.   Thanks for the update Big Cliff
774507,moxie,2013-03-19 10:08:00,1566,Hoping for positives.
774508,Roy,2013-03-19 10:16:00,13728,"Thanks for the update, Cliff. It IS a slow process but as long as Sean stays stable and improves however slowly, he will get better. Thoughts and prayers from J and I."
774544,quickme,2013-03-19 14:32:00,261,thanks for the update!  Its a marathon not a sprint.  Keeping positive thoughts and please keep the updates coming.   nick
774710,motv8tr,2013-03-20 10:17:00,2587,"Thanks for the update Cliff, little steps are way better than no steps....fingers are crossed for Sean to be able to return to the GTA soon  Maureen"
774734,TJQ,2013-03-20 13:45:00,7806,"Yup, thanks for the update.  I hope things get better  .. faster!"
774738,The Urban Fisherman,2013-03-20 13:55:00,2050,Thanks Cliff!
774751,fishnsled,2013-03-20 15:10:00,3520,Thanks for the update Cliff.  Would certainly be nice for the family if they can get him back to the GTA very soon.
774781,mercman,2013-03-20 16:58:00,7054,"Thanks for the update my friend. I continue to send positive thoughts thier way. I know they are keeping the faith, and thats the key here.   Paul"
776493,Pikeslayer,2013-03-30 22:15:00,1443,"Hey OFC!! Happy Easter!! First off, thanks for the continued PM's & emails.They are most appreciated by myself & Sean. Apologies for the delays in posting updates, but I'm trying to limit them to 'milestones'. . So here is the latest. It's a 'biggie'.  03/29 Update We've been waiting for something 'significant' to report and post in an update and so here's a great news update on Sean; Troy (Sean's brother in law) visited last weekend and we noticed that Sean's ability to 'track' and attention had improved in duration. Troy was showing Sean some videos of Leah and NHL highlights and we noticed Sean was able to focus for intermittent 10 second spans. A week later, Mom & Tyler are here to visit and his attention span is easily 30 seconds or more, and definitely more frequent. Sean is responding to voice now by turning his head in the proper direction to follow voice and movement. This seems to be very challenging for him but he is trying very hard. The increased activity is also somewhat exhausting for him and our challenge is to not over stimulate him and allow him to rest appropriately in between activity. Sean's neuro nurse has instructed us to constantly encourage and let him know he is improving and getting better day by day. Technically Sean is still comatose, but he is trying like hell to wake up. We are more optimistic day by day and these small steps are positive progress to continued improvement and recovery. No matter how long the road is, and without doubt, we know your thoughts, prayers and messages of hope and encouragement have been, and continue to be, as important as the medical team efforts and ongoing treatment.  Please keep them coming. We are all truly grateful.  03/30 This morning, Sean’s treach was ‘capped’ to evaluate whether he could breathe through his mouth/nose. He passed the 8 hour test with flying colours. Obviously this was more physically demanding for him and his awareness level was somewhat subsided vs. yesterday. We’ll take that though. It’s another step towards his recovery and eventual return home to Ontario.   Sincererly, The Murphy's  "
776498,lew,2013-03-30 22:37:00,12766,Every small step forward is a step in the right direction.  Great to hear about the improvements and thanks for letting us know of the progress.
776551,Joey,2013-03-31 03:33:00,9122,"Wonderful news Simon.  Those are some dramatic changes, even tho they seem small, they are huge!!!"
776565,Rich Clemens,2013-03-31 10:41:00,3131,Great news Simon.  Sometimes we have to take the hard road - to make us stronger in the end.  Looks like we're starting to see it
776566,motv8tr,2013-03-31 10:55:00,2587,"Excellent news Simon, every little step adds up to a great leap, Keep it going Sean, the fish are waiting for you...  Maureen"
776822,quickme,2013-04-01 13:55:00,261,fantastic to hear!!!   Seem like small steps but they are BIG leaps to recovery.  Remember to also take care of yourselfs also.   You're family is in my prayers!   nick

808430,HTHM,2013-09-19 00:31:00,4082,"From Pikeslayer:  Time for another update;  BTW, this Friday (Sept 20) is Sean's 25th birthday. We'll be keeping it ""low key"" and hope to celebrate sometime down the road. That said, birthday cards would certainly brighten his days (and his room) so I would respectfully ask that everyone goes ""20th Century"", buy a card & a stamp, and drop the envelope in a mailbox (they're red & say Canada Post on them). Doesn't matter if it arrives late BTW. Address to;Sean Murphyc/o NRIO1320 Woodeden DriveMississauga, ONL5H 2T6 Sean has settled in quite well @ NRIO and continues to receive daily therapy and care from the awesome team @ the Mississauga Residence. Speech & Language Therapy focus is on primarily strengthening his swallowing process which uses the same muscles as the larynx/voice box. Hopefully Sean may regain speech sometime in the future.Physiotherapy is the other key focus in order to relieve muscular spasticity and Sean is receiving intense sessions 2-3 times per week. More Botox injections are scheduled in the coming weeks and this should help relax his upper body & arms. A new custom fitted wheelchair is scheduled to be delivered just after his birthday, so we will be able to get Sean out for neighborhood walks & fresh air. Although Sean has been @ NRIO for less than 3 months, we have seen measured progress and remain guardedly optimistic that he will continue to recover and are well prepared to remain patient for however long it may take. Thanks to everyone for the continued support, best wishes, prayers and visits with Sean."
808480,mercman,2013-09-19 17:45:00,7054,Good news !!! Thanks for posting this Albert !! Let him know that I think of him often.
808572,Big Cliff,2013-09-20 10:25:00,6899,"It is good to hear that Sean is getting the kind of care and support he deserves and needs! Time, prayers and the love and support of family and friends will all go a long way to helping this fine young man on his journey to recovery."
