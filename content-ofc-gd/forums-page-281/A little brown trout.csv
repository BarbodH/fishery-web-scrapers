I did have a little bit of time before I picked up the kids, so I hit the stream just down from our house. No monsters. No interesting tales, or tails for that matter, but a nice couple of hours splashing in some riffles. May get out for some grouse and trout this Friday.     Looks fishy      Caught another brownie same size as the photo and maybe 4 chub all on flatfishes."
808034,chris.brock,2013-09-16 22:38:00,4053,looks like a great way to spend an afternoon
808038,Locnar,2013-09-16 23:12:00,645,"It may not be the biggest fish out there, but it sure is pretty"
808112,Moosebunk,2013-09-17 04:04:00,3970,Rob.  Ya could have been working.  Seems much better a day than that.
808414,wildeye rainbow,2013-09-18 22:13:00,123,nice brown! I was out on a brown stream today. water was low and gin clear. Tried a few deep holes with worms - just chubs.  had 2 small brown flash at my spinner but no hookups.  Nice day to be bushwacking.  WR
808419,Joeytier,2013-09-18 22:26:00,3990,Cool. Never thought about using a flatfish for the stream troots
808422,kickingfrog,2013-09-18 22:46:00,8333,It's all about the wiggle.
808500,misfish,2013-09-19 20:06:00,29133,"I always have my micro kwik fish on hand Rod. Great for hot shotting in currents.  BTW,Why are you fishing my spots? I guess I need to work on my back grounds."
808531,kickingfrog,2013-09-20 00:56:00,8333, We've both likely been fishin' that crick longer then the net has been around.
808635,MJL,2013-09-20 19:17:00,2427,Nicely done Rob. I don't have any flatfish in my box but Kwikfish have taken some of my bigger resident browns
808647,misfish,2013-09-20 20:47:00,29133,"Lets see what I can get in the morning.  I,ll be doubled up. Fly and spinning rod.    Thats the best part bud."
