808368,Joey,2013-09-18 18:12:00,9122,"We all carry cameras on the boat, so this can be sorta fishing  Found this great camera bag at Costco for $39.99.  Just an FYI for anyone interested.  It even comes with a waterproof cover you can put on if it rains.  I figured it would be great for the boat, or for slinging over your shoulder on walks etc.  I found it great because it fits my long lens, and I was having a hard time finding a carry bag that did that was not ridiculously bulky or awkward to carry, or pricey.   ** I do not work for Costco**  http://www.costco.ca/National-Geographic-Explorer-DSLR-Sling-Camera-Bag-.product.100013231.html"
