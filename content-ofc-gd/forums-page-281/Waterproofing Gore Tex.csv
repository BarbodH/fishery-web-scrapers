I have done the sprays and wash ins before but they don't seem to work very well . They seem to ""wet out"" way to fast compared to when they were new . I know I will probably not get the repellency back to when they were new but there must be something out there that works . Anyone here like to share some ideas/techniques or products that you have personally used that worked well . Thanks"
807663,BillM,2013-09-13 15:02:00,17367,I like Nikwash on my Loop wading jacket.  No complaints.
807666,NANUK,2013-09-13 16:21:00,797,I have been using Nikwax or ReviveX on all my Gore Tex gear with good results.
807691,Bill Shearer,2013-09-13 20:10:00,456,"Both products mentioned,  are best for the renewal to factory standard. Simms recommends Revivex. Just follow the directions."
807692,wallacio,2013-09-13 20:18:00,475,"Similar to what has already been stated, Nikwax or Revivex.   Personally I've had the best luck with Nikwak wash-in products.  I first clean with this:  http://www.mec.ca/product/4004-475/nikwax-tech-wash-cleaner/?f=10+50544  Then waterproof with this:  http://www.mec.ca/product/4003-388/nikwax-tx-direct-wash-in-waterproofer/?f=10+50544  I just treated my Simms G4 jacket before this trip and it stood up all day to heavy rains without wetting-out!  "
807978,FrankTheRabbit,2013-09-16 18:48:00,479,"If it's wetting out too quickly, after applying the cleaning/treating products, it might be time to send them in for warranty. If the manufacturer won't honour the warranty, Gore will definitely honour their materials used for the jacket/pants.  I had that happen to my jacket and I sent it in, they ran a few tests, and I received a brand new jacket. In cases like this, you do get what you pay for."
808055,musky_hunter,2013-09-17 00:28:00,328,Just bought the Nikwax kit (cleaner and treatment) for $23 at lebarons. Will give a review after a few outings.
