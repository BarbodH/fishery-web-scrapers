807868,walleyejack,2013-09-15 16:55:00,358,"Was thinking (doesn t happen often) about down loading navionics in my android phone, Read some reviews on thier site, some said it was great, but i think more didn t like it, some paid the fee and didn t work at all, Any opinions would help me out..      Thanks  Al"
807869,kickingfrog,2013-09-15 17:05:00,8333,"I put it on my andriod phone 2 years ago and I can't say one bad thing about it. I don't use it on the water too much because I do have the chip in my finders, but I do use it to pre-scout and those ""I wonder"" times."
807870,walleyejack,2013-09-15 17:39:00,358,good to know       thanks 
807885,Freshtrax,2013-09-15 20:17:00,2215,Works fantastic on the ipad
807886,danklegrand,2013-09-15 20:27:00,55,"Awesome for iphone5.  I was skeptical at first too, but totally worth the price.  I also rarely use it on the water, but it's great for planning where you're headed tomorrow morning."
807887,walleyejack,2013-09-15 20:35:00,358,gonna tryi i guess. hopefully works on android
807914,porkpie,2013-09-16 01:18:00,2521,"Works great on my iphone, but hotmaps on my sonar is even more amazing!"
807917,Richie Razor,2013-09-16 01:30:00,536,"Highly recommend for scouting areas, and during ice fishing. Does what it's supposed to do, go for it."
807934,mike rousseau,2013-09-16 06:12:00,4661,Great on iPhone
807935,Stoty,2013-09-16 08:12:00,2910,"Anyone who doesnt have it, is missing out. Great app. Plays a massive part in hauling 10lb+ eyes through the ice on Quinte."
807950,quickme,2013-09-16 13:23:00,261,I've had a little issues with it on Scugog during overcast days but still worth it.  Its great on the ice also.  You won't regret getting it.   nick
807953,walleyejack,2013-09-16 13:47:00,358,"ok  thanks everyone,  gonna give it a shot....... the cheap one $15. or the HD $55.  ? am sure the 15 buck one will do just fine tho. put me in the zone possibly."
807961,Freshtrax,2013-09-16 14:50:00,2215,  This is a screenshot of the cheaper one...I also like the speed readout while trolling
807962,walleyejack,2013-09-16 15:19:00,358,kewl.. just what I am looking for      Thanks  mainly going to use it to get an idea of where I want to head to. to find  structure and things.
808089,Stoty,2013-09-17 03:02:00,2910,"Does the $15 one have the 1ft contours? If not... I'd highly recommend the HD one. It's a one-time purchase, so well worth it, IMO."
808116,mike rousseau,2013-09-17 06:50:00,4661, I was thinking about upgrading...  Can you get hd on iPhone....?  I thought it was only iPad....  ..
808118,Stoty,2013-09-17 06:58:00,2910,1ft depth contours     
808119,fishindevil,2013-09-17 07:19:00,6254,Wow !!! That's awesome Jamie !!! Is that like the hot maps version ?? And does it still show the same as the non hd ???? Like the same coverage??? Thanks
808120,Stoty,2013-09-17 07:27:00,2910,"I have the Navionics ""Marine & Lakes: US & Canada"" app version 4.7.1  It literally covers all of Canada/USA."
808124,fishindevil,2013-09-17 10:01:00,6254,So that's the one I should get ?? How much is it ?? Thanks
808126,Stoty,2013-09-17 10:19:00,2910,When I got it... it was $15
808162,mike rousseau,2013-09-17 15:33:00,4661,Can't get it for iPhone I guess... The HD  Just showing up for the iPad....  That sucks...
808208,Jigs,2013-09-17 19:40:00,136,I have the 15$ one for Iphone 4S and I get 1 foot depth contour but not for the St-Lawrence. Might be that certain lakes have that feature and others don't.
808326,walleyejack,2013-09-18 13:49:00,358,"hmm tried to purchase for my android, went through the whole deal, reluctantly put in my credit card number, and all the info. then comes up currency not acceptable or something, so I tried another card, same thing, anyone have issues purchasing navonics ? I sent them an email, but no response."
808336,quickme,2013-09-18 14:59:00,261, pm richnavionics .   He is pretty good with Navionic issues.
