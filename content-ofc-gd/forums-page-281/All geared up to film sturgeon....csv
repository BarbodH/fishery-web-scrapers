Ill do my best to film some big old sturgeon jumpin for the good folks here! Sitting on the deck now and not hearing much? Maybe the cold front turns them off jumping? But I'll give her a shot!
808701,mattyk,2013-09-21 09:49:00,2110,Good luck!
808703,Terry,2013-09-21 09:54:00,14456,they would be great to record
808704,Roy,2013-09-21 10:12:00,13728,Looking forward to seeing what you can get. Lots jumping around here but I haven't the patience to film.
808749,kickingfrog,2013-09-21 18:35:00,8333,I look forward to seeing that.
