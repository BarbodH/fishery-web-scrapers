808167,manitoubass2,2013-09-17 15:44:00,11391,People should always have the right to bear arms. Looks what happens in countries that do not allow people to bear arms. People need to be able to protect themselves and feed themselves. A population without guns quickly turns a government into a tyranny
808169,ch312,2013-09-17 15:50:00,1590," It's funny that those who know nothing about firearms try to say what should be banned, yet the misinformed can't distinguish the difference between a semi auto firearm (which is the exact same as semi auto rifles used for hunting) and a fully automatic firearm (true assault rifle).  But, but, but that rifle is black and looks scary so it MUST be an assault rifle and MUST be banned"
808171,Tim Mills,2013-09-17 15:58:00,476,The fear mongering is definitely a factor. A year ago we were all saying how sad and disturbing the Conn school shooting was. If there was ever an event that should have brought the Dems and Reps together to bring about common sense gun legislation that was it. In the months that followed the Conn shooting gun sales went through the roof. Americans were fearfull that gun restrictions were coming and that if they didn't buy certain guns now they would not be able to in the future.  I was born in the states and enjoying visiting but stories like this remind me that I'm lucky to live in Canada.

The shotgun was purchased legally in Virginia and then brought illegally into Washington D.C. It is still believed Alexis stole the handguns off of police officers at the scene. According to NBC Washington, Aaron Alexis, the man who carried out a deadly rampage at Washington D.C.'s Navy Yard yesterday, purchased a shotgun legally and passed a background check through the FBI NICS system. The other firearms Alexis used in the shooting were two 9mm semi-automatic handguns and were stolen after he made it onto the base. hxxp://townhall.com/tipsheet/katiepavlich/2013/09/17/report-navy-yard-shooter-stole-firearms-used-in-rampage-n1702267   So, it appears that it wasn't even a scary assault rifle like the media assumed it was when multiple false reports were broadcast yesterday. He bought the firearm legally after passing an FBI background check (meaning clean record, FBI deemed him safe to own a firearm) and proceeded to take the firearm into an area where firearms are prohibited by civilians before stealing handguns from officers.  If this isn't enough proof that stricter laws will do nothing to prevent such tragedies then I dunno what is."

My own personal feelings regarding the gun epidemic in the U.S. aside, I believe that if the various levels of governments had any concern for their citizens well being, beyond their financial contributions, we just might see less of these kinds of incidents. When poverty and a sense of despair take over anyone, some will become disillusioned and some will move to violence. I truly think our friends to the south have bigger issues to deal with then gun control. Gun violence is only a symptom of many other ills.

808207,aplumma,2013-09-17 19:16:00,6896,"The best part of this thread is it will never change anyones mind on their views on gun control. Both sides can give 10 reasons on why it is right/wrong and neither side will give an inch of ground. The fact is what your government allows is what it will be as far as gun ownership. The gun owners (legal) do not see a flaw in the system because it works for them. Once you take it into the illegally owned guns there are already laws being broken and new laws will not prevent those intent on having illegal weapons in their possession from doing so. If we had 100 Canadians with guns in there house and 100 US Citizens with guns in their house you would find the same # on both sides pulled the trigger to defend their lives and family. If we have 100 Canadians armed with baseball bats and 100 US Citizens armed with guns you would find the same # of people used their weapon to protect their lives and families. Guns are not evil they do not have any choice in the act of using them for their intended function. You can shoot targets from now till doomsday with it legally as well as save your life or family legally and that is a mind set you either have or not both are correct in each ones views. To ask how many guns does one need is the same question you can ask of someone who has more than one fishing rod/reel. The answer is the same, what is the tools job to be done. I have 34 fishing rods that have different jobs or requirements and like each one of them for what they do. I will have 35 rods if I find a niche that it will fill and it makes me happy. I feel the same way about guns some of my guns may never get fired but I see them as a work of art or a piece of history that can't be replaced. Some of them are built for a specific purpose one pistol is for target shooting it is sooooo smooth and balanced I can shoot 500 rounds and walk away happy and satisfied. One pistol shoots a hunk of lead so big it turns a watermelon into airborn soup or lifts a 1 x 1 chunk of sod up into the air. You ask why do I have it ? It makes me smile and it is legal just like the custom rod and reel you treasure. Arguing gun control with a nation that has different laws and different mindsets will never provide us with a winning solution or even a change of thoughts on the subject.  Please keep this thread civil and respectful of others views as it progresses. Thank you   Art"

808214,bigugli,2013-09-17 20:21:00,6138,"Every time this issue comes up, it has the same polarization of evil/ not evil. However, to play devil's advocate..  Lets agree that guns are evil because of the harm they can cause.  Ban them.  Ban sharp knives. They can kill, therefore they are evil.  Logically, we must also ban alcohol, and cigarettes, as they also kill.  Cars kill too, perhaps we should also ban them?  We could go on and on with this line of simplistic argument.  Regardless of the circumstance, these are merely objects. Incapable of doing any harm of their own accord. I The problem is the people using and abusing the objects. Good and evil reside in people, not objects."
808215,lew,2013-09-17 20:22:00,12766," Your right Art, most of us would do whatever we could to defend our families.  Things is though, there's a HUGE difference between Canadians and Americans in the way we think about guns....at least handguns. For you fellas it's a very large part of your lives and something you all feel very strongly about, whereas Canadians don't think of handguns the same way. In all my years I've never owned a handgun or ever even thought of wanting one, infact I've never known anybody who has one either.  I read a few of the American websites and am actually amazed at the number of guys that carry guns. One boating website has threads where they talk about what guns they carry when they go fishing and where do they mount the holsters.  If I EVER felt I needed to take a gun fishing for protection I'd definetely take up another sport.  Another site is about pick-up trucks and there they talk about where everyone mounts their guns inside the cab of the truck. They've got them in the center consoles, under the seat, or even mounted to the steering column, where they say it's easiest to reach in a hurry when you need it. My gawd, I'd be afraid to travel in places where I need fast access to my gun.  That's the way Americans live...at least some of them...and if that's the way you guys want it,  so be it, but it sure isn't the way most Canadians think...at least none that I've ever known.  I lived in Toronto for 62 years and never once was I ever threatened by anyone, let alone threatened with a gun. Toronto has a population of roughly 2 1/2 million people, yet there's only around 60 murders a year and most of those are gang and drug related. Take any American city with 2 1/2 million people and the murder rate is probably at least 100 times more.  You folks have your guns and your ""right to bear arms"" thing, but you also have mass shootings on a regular basis, and it doesn't seem to matter whether it's military bases, schools, movie theaters, shopping centers or anything else.  Guys grab guns, whether they be pistols, shotguns, automatics or whatever and walk into a crowd and just start killing as many people as they can.  I was watching the Today Show this morning and they even talked about classes people can take to learn what to do when your caught in the cross fire of a mass murderer with guns.  Canada on the other hand doesn't have everyone wanting to carry a gun everywhere , and we also don't have all the mass murders, infact it's very rare to hear about them up here and I don't even know the last time an indiscriminate mass murder happened in this country.  I don't have the answers and probably nobody else does either, but it just seems odd that the country with so many guys talking about their right to bear arms has all the devastation, while we don't think about guns the same way and we don't have the trouble.  I just hope someone can figure out a way for you guys to stop the insane murder of so many innocent people on such a regular basis."
808216,lookinforwalleye,2013-09-17 20:30:00,4399, If you think the American economy is not based on weapons of all kinds you better think again...the usa is the largest exporter of weapons in the world an one of the largest importers in the world.

808220,Richie Razor,2013-09-17 20:45:00,536,"   I have absolutely no problem whatsoever with people using rifles for harvesting food for consumption. Actually I plan on taking my hunting courses in the next several weeks and acquiring hunting rifles as I have many friends that hunt and have own land in which to hunt deer, turkey, pheasant and rabbit. I’m all for guns used for hunting, now that’s me typing this as I live in the GTA and must abide by the laws of my jurisdiction. However, if I was living in say Florida or Texas (for example) where owning a gun could mean life or death – and the laws allow ownership of such weapons for protection, your damn straight I’d be packing heat.  Personally I think it’s a lost cause in parts of the USA due to all the illegal weapons, drugs, and the sheer amount of Americans living under the poverty line (40+ million !!!) which have a much higher propensity to be involved in nefarious activities. I guess some places in the States you have no choice but to own weapons for protection, I don’t see how American can be proud of this, but with the amount of Gun sales in the USA last year (30+ Billion – non-military) I can say that it’s come down to an arms race on a civil scale."

808237,aplumma,2013-09-17 22:09:00,6896,"Well written Lew thanks for your view. I guess the easiest way to answer it is you are right there is no easy answer for the US to prevent illegal ownership of guns. The lid of pandora's box has been opened in this case. Closing the box will not cause this issue to go away or change the way we think about guns.  I do know that at no time where you afraid to talk, drink, eat or fish with me when we get together other than the odd bad joke I am famous for telling. I was brought up to know that a gun equals meat, safety, recreation, and a real resalable value in a legal manner. This is what I strive to protect the legal ownership of guns and a tradition of responsibility that is available through ownership of guns.  The amount of times I hear on this board that someone broke into their car, house, boat, etc. amazes me and I can't believe how often it happens. What happened to respecting others property and personal space?  I was brought up with the view if it is not mine don't touch it and it is not the fear of being shot at that leads me to act this way. It is the culture I was raised in that makes me follow this path as well as the culture you were raised in. I personally know that you  hold this value so being Canadian or being a US Citizen is not a dividing line here. The issue here is strictly when we add the word illegal/ immoral or unethical is when the gun issue goes bad. That said we can substitute now any weapon (we meaning both Canadian and American) here and all have the same argument should knives/ crossbows, cast iron frying pans be illegal. All can kill but all can be used for legal purposes also. If people  look around them they can find a way to abuse anything and kill or maim anyone. Even knowledge can be abused and turned into a weapon take the man approaching you with empty hands he is a SEAL he can kill you burning less than 50 calories or the man passing the other way he can hack into a hospitals power grid and kill 50 people. The point is it is our values that make us do the right thing not the availability of objects that surround us.   Art"

It's the simple fact that our high standard of living combined with strict gun laws have in essence weeded out most of the purveyors of gun crime. We still do have gun crime, but on such a smaller scale, it's almost a non issue for the majority of Canadians.  In the United States however the despairity between classes, social and economic factors which drive certain aspects of Amercian culture, combined with easy access to guns (both illegal and leagal) are the 2 largest factors behind the amount of gun crimes that occur south of the 49th.

The key facts are: • The US has the highest gun ownership rate in the world - an average of 88 per 100 people.

Because you certainly couldnt kill 12 people with one of those, or actually you could, easily.  So maybe we ban those too, pump actions?  Well gee, idk, but they seem like they could be pretty deadly, cant have em, single shots, well ok, but be careful because if we could ban those and it only saves one life it could be worth it.  Rifles of any kind are another story, they are all basically sniper of potentially fully automatic baby killing machines so, their gone too.  The vast majority of all of those murders you mentioned were by hand gun, but no one has even talked about banning them, and they wont be, instead people who hold your attitude are trying to ban firearms that are the weapon of choice less often than hands or feet.  You can make an argument to ban any gun if your belief is that they are inherently bad and it could save a life, but then there are a lot of other things that we could ban for similar reasons, or we could accept living in a free society with the risks that come with it, which includes getting shot by a mad man, the good news is that gun violence and violent crime in general has been decreasing there and here, so your odds of being shot are less, but you wouldnt know it."

808166,ch312,2013-09-17 15:44:00,1590,"  Sorry, but it's people like you who rely on the media for your ""facts"" and you are the one who is sadly misinformed. This doesn't happen in Canada because of the firearms we can or cannot access?  The shotgun he used to kill is 100 % accessible by anyone in Canada with a firearms license. The AR-15 he took from the murdered guard is 100 % accessible by anyone in Canada who chooses to write the restricted firearms exam.   No, this is NOT totally different than hunting firearms we're permitted to use here. Know why? Because the AR-15 he used is NO DIFFERENT than ANY semi automatic firearm that Canadians use for hunting, including semi auto's many of our grandfathers used. I'm not sure if you're aware of this or not, but handguns are easily accessible here in Canada too."
807976,lew,2013-09-16 18:37:00,12766,I just put the TV on a few minutes ago and their reporting yet another mass murder in the States. It's evidently in some sort of naval installation in D.C. and they say there's 12 people confirmed dead plus a bunch of others injured.  Unbelievable how this sort of thing keeps happening down there.
807990,grt1,2013-09-16 19:37:00,638,"I've been watching the coverage on tv, it is amazing that in this day and age with all the security concerns and issues surrounding a vital military installation that someone could do this kind of damage, 12 dead, (including the suspected gunmen) and a number of people wounded. with all the various agencies responding to the call for help makes you wonder how any accomplice could escape ( since the chief of police for the city said they are looking for another 2 suspects)  it is just so sad to see something like this happen,"
807993,OhioFisherman,2013-09-16 19:50:00,6623,"I can just hear the folks in the house and senate now, we don't need no gun control! but more taxpayer funded security for us is on the way! I think they sent the senate home, so they could crawl into taxpayer funded shelters. LOL"
808000,Richie Razor,2013-09-16 20:10:00,536,"Unreal, but i'm not surprised. With lax gun laws, and a large contigent of mentally unstable people created by Amercian sub-culture, its no wonder that these type of events happen on a yearly basis. You can only imagine what the families of the victims are going through."
808001,Terry,2013-09-16 20:13:00,14456,"and when it happens in Canada, is it from watching America tv...........lol"
808002,fishindevil,2013-09-16 20:16:00,6254,Ya it's all over the radio just heard it as well !!! What the hell is this world Comming too ??? Is it terrorism related or they don't know yet ??? This crap is unreal....
808003,Richie Razor,2013-09-16 20:23:00,536," Canada and The United States are more similar than we think, I do somewhat agree with your statement... However, when was the last time something like this happened in Canada? Also - How easy is it to obtain hand guns and automatic assault rifles in Canada? In some parts in the States, it's as easy as showing them a drivers licence. Although we are very similar in some cultural aspects, the differences in gun legislation is the key difference maker imo."
808004,ch312,2013-09-16 20:24:00,1590,"Sigh...I really wish the misinformed would leave ""gun control"" out of this as it has NOTHING to do with this. Why? Criminals and nut jobs will get their hands on guns and other weapons regardless of what some law says. Look at all the ignorant folks who supported the gun registry that was supposed to stop gun crimes in Canada, when in fact it did nothing at all to lower gun related crimes. What it did do a good job of was punishing law abiding citizens and wasting a couple billion dollars.  Sad indeed, but more gun control (even a 100% ban of firearm ownership nation wide) definitely would not prevent firearm related crimes. The fact is the majority of firearms used by crooks and wacko's are imported from different countries meaning punishing law abiding firearms owners with even more rules would do diddly squat."
808005,misfish,2013-09-16 20:27:00,29133,"   People kill,not guns."

808008,ch312,2013-09-16 20:32:00,1590," Very easy to obtain a handgun if you have the money and know someone who is in the drug trade. While I have never been involved in such Bull, I did hang around with the wrong crowd as a teen for a short while and can assure you that only a few hundred dollars will ""hook you up"". Automatic firearms (NOT semi auto, HUGE difference!) , not so easy as they're prohibited in Canada, but still obtainable. FYI...buying a fully automatic firearm requires permits in the US. An AR-15 for example is a semi auto firearm, not full auto like the media would like you to believe.   As for obtaining a legal firearm in Canada, it's as simple as reading a book and challenging the firearms exam which then permits you to buy an unlimited number of non restricted firearms. To compare apple to apples, it's much easier to obtain a firearms license than it is to get a drivers license."
808010,Richie Razor,2013-09-16 20:41:00,536,"  Sorry, but you are sadly misinformed. Yes, gun crimes happen with stolen guns, this is 100% true, also gun crimes happen with legally bought guns, 100% true as well. I'm not talking about hunting rifles, this is totally different - I'm talking about hand guns and assault rifles that are easily accessible and available in the USA in different states. You don’t have crimes like this happening in Canada due to the types of guns we can access with the proper licensing, however the criminals will always find a way to access whatever they want."
808011,woodenboater,2013-09-16 20:44:00,2277,"the more I hear/read about these types of events, the more I truly believe part of western culture is on the verge of collapse..."
808012,BillM,2013-09-16 20:44:00,17367,Apparently one of the gunman who was killed had a CCW.    They are looking for suspect #2 now.
808013,aplumma,2013-09-16 20:51:00,6896,I don't mind you chiming in with your statement but get the facts straight. You can not at any place in the USA legally get a gun with just a drivers license. You do get a back round check and the gun is registered to you. No felons or people who have been deemed mentally ill or convicted of a violent crime can legally have a gun in their possession. Now to clarify all of the people mentioned can get ahold of an illegal gun just as any one born in Canada can. The rifles used for violence are not legal to own weapons in most cases but are military rifles that have illegally been purchased. Sorry for this rant but it is an important difference for all to know that legally owned and responsible citizens of the US far outnumber the few illegally gotten guns used in these heinous attacks that can occur in any place in the world.   Art
808015,Richie Razor,2013-09-16 21:00:00,536," Hey Art, all i'm saying is this stuff happens more often then not down south than up here. Sure there have been incidents in canada, but thankfully it's few and far between (i'm not talking about gang shooting in the big smoke) I'm referring to the mass killing by the hands of deranged people that buy these guns with the proper licencing - You can't deny that this is a major issue, as these peole for the most part are undiagnosed with any mental issue before buying a gun and going on a killing spree."
808017,misfish,2013-09-16 21:20:00,29133," So it,s the undiagnosed people with any mental issue ?  Any law abidding owner, can snap and do the same. We dont know what triggered this person do what he did.  Lets not put the horse before the wagon here sorta speak..  Art,well said."
808018,OhioFisherman,2013-09-16 21:21:00,6623,"I don't know about that Art, they have guns for sale at the local flea market all the time. It is my understanding that a gun dealer needs to be licensed to sell guns, but a private citizen selling his own personal firearms does not.  I have never seen anyone at the flea market ask for anything more than cash when selling a gun."
808019,aplumma,2013-09-16 21:22:00,6896,The truth is if we compare apples to apples meaning  violent crimes against fellow man with an equal access of deadly weapons per percentage of people you will find the numbers are comparable. There is no more mentally ill people in the US per population density as in any other nation including Europe and the Middle East. (barring our politicians but that is an a discussion for another day lol). To date I have not ever seen a gun kill anyone I have seen people use the gun (read Tool) to do a job it was made for. A point to raise is there are only a lack of Legal handguns in Canada there are plenty of illegal ones though. A fact that I am comfortable with is this if I placed 5 boxes on a table and told you that under 4 boxes are envelopes with anything from $100.00 to $500.00 and the fifth box will kill you would you play the game with me? It is the same thought pattern we have down South which house is armed and will use a gun? 1 in 5 is the answer. Back to the original post this is a true tragedy and one that hits close to home. I live 30 miles from the Capitol and the manpower that was massed in such a short time is comforting and the resources we will deploy will be considerable. The people or groups involved will be dealt with in a manner that will be more compassionate than I choose but in the end justice will be the judge which is what is the cornerstone of freedom in the USA.

808023,aplumma,2013-09-16 21:29:00,6896,The key here is a legal sale. Any gun that is sold must be done thru a licensed gun sales point. If I give a gun to my brother as a gift to legally do it I have to go with him to a gun shop and fill out a form to transfer it to his custody. Many guns are sold illegally but if the paperwork is not correct the person that the gun was last registered to as an owner will be charged with a felony. I loaned a rifle to a friend last year to hunt groundhogs on his property and after 6 months he was still not sure if it was the rifle for him so I brought him to the gunshop and transferred ownership to him till he decides if he wants to have one custom made like this one is.   Art
808024,OhioFisherman,2013-09-16 21:34:00,6623,"Summary of Federal Law Federal law imposes various duties on federally licensed firearms dealers.  Firearms dealers must, among other things: (1) perform background checks on prospective firearm purchasers; (2) maintain records of all gun sales; (3) make those records available to law enforcement for inspection; (4) report multiple sales; and (5) report the theft or loss of a firearm from the licensee’s inventory.19  Federal law imposes none of these requirements on unlicensed sellers, however. The Gun Control Act of 1968 provides that persons “engaged in the business” of dealing in firearms must be licensed.20  Although Congress did not originally define the term “engaged in the business,” it did so in 1986 as part of the McClure-Volkmer Act (also known as the “Firearms Owners’ Protection Act”).  That Act defined the term “engaged in the business,” as applied to a firearms dealer, as “a person who devotes time, attention, and labor to dealing in firearms as a regular course of trade or business with the principal objective of livelihood and profit through the repetitive purchase and resale of firearms.”21 Significantly, however, the term was defined to exclude a person who “makes occasional sales, exchanges, or purchases of firearms for the enhancement of a personal collection or for a hobby, or who sells all or part of his personal collection of firearms.”22 According to a 1999 report issued by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF), the current definition of “engaged in the business” often frustrates the prosecution of “unlicensed dealers masquerading as collectors or hobbyists but who are really trafficking firearms to felons or other prohibited persons.”23  http://smartgunlaws.org/private-sales-policy-summary/"
808026,Richie Razor,2013-09-16 21:40:00,536," So would you consider someone who commits these types of henious acts a sane person, or in the right state of mind as your self??? If that's the case I'd say have a governmint and chill out lol.  If you feel that you can snap and murder several people then you shouldn't be allowed in public until further mental analysis has been done, simple as that."
808028,misfish,2013-09-16 21:56:00,29133," have a governmint and chill out lol.  Oh Im chilled,and know first hand. So I speak of what I have seen.  A very good friend,known for almost 20 years. He was the nicest guy you could know. Never ever had a fight in his life. One day ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,   Im not going to spill what happen,but Im sure you of all,get my point here.  HE SNAPPED. It,s in all of us. Knowing how to control it,thats another thing.  Taking life,I dont agree with. Taking your own,go for it."
808036,blarg,2013-09-16 22:50:00,289,"In other words you believe what the CBC tells you. yep, lets ban 'assault rifles' that actually aren't because they account for a tiny fraction of overall gun murders, not even to mention total murders, fewer than things like hammers, or fists, or feet.  But they are scary, and we know what scary looking things do to people without critical thinking skills.  Hand guns will surely never be banned, they are simply accepted as a personal defence tool, rightly or wrongly, but complaints about how the terrible assault rifles that arent need to be banned are simply wrong, the stattiscs don't lie."
