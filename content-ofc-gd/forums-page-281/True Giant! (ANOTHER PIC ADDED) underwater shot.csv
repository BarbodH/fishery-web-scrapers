807972,muskymatt,2013-09-16 18:09:00,2608,  And finally!  
807973,lew,2013-09-16 18:19:00,12766,"More great pictures Matt, looks like that big ole girl has lost a few teeth over the years."
807974,muskymatt,2013-09-16 18:23:00,2608," LOL , yes she does seem to be  a little shy in the tooth dept. I was wondering how much of that was due to the hookset and fight. She was hooked in her left side corner of the mouth or right side as you look at the pic, the sheer weight and pull was incredible as she dragged that bait back and forth over the jaw as she battled."
807975,lew,2013-09-16 18:29:00,12766,"Yeah, a fight like that with a big bait in her mouth could sure do some damage to her teeth I'd imagine."
808095,Moosebunk,2013-09-17 03:23:00,3970,OK Matt... you and your gang are on 'em... we get it. lol.  Nicely done again bud.  Congrats to Luc on a huge Ottawa R. ski.
807816,muskymatt,2013-09-15 02:14:00,2608,"Wow, what a fish. Luc and I have hooked up fishing together through FB twice this year. The first time I lost a giant, today Luc more than made up for it with this giant.  52.125"" long and an incredible head and girth.  It hit a bucktail while working a shallow weed edge.  Man am I going to replay it coming into view in my head for a few days lol   "
