807206,beertech,2013-09-11 00:51:00,118,wondered what everyone uses for jiging mr twisters for walleye   .   what action length fast or xfast tip
807212,Joeytier,2013-09-11 00:57:00,3990,"Jigging with plastics i like shorter blanks with faster tips.  Im using a 7' quantum accurist right now and like it a lot ( the price was right).  Basically anything 6'6"" to 7' with a fast/xfast action and a soft tip will be ideal."
807226,Richie Razor,2013-09-11 01:27:00,536,Shimano compre and crucial 7ft medium with fast action. There are a ton of good rod options out there in this category.
807227,Stoty,2013-09-11 01:34:00,2910,"Simax Loca 6'6 MH are one of the nicest rods around. Nice to have the fast tip, with still some good backbone behind it for those Quinte monsters."
807237,beertech,2013-09-11 02:07:00,118,I own 3 simax rods and like them.  Dont know of any stores that carry them at this point though.  I loved the quantum smoke i had in my hand today but the micro guides im guessing wont past through the braid to fluorocarbon knots
807241,Joeytier,2013-09-11 02:19:00,3990,My quantum has microguides and the uni to unis go through without an issue...just trim your ends tight lol
807249,Stoty,2013-09-11 02:44:00,2910, Pro J and Angling Outfitters have them in stock right now I believe.
807253,mike rousseau,2013-09-11 03:06:00,4661,Cabelas XML walleye series  Jig & pitch model...  They're really great rods...
807294,Fish4Eyes,2013-09-11 12:51:00,1022,6' St Croix Avid ML fast action. Medium is too stiff for jigging in my opinion (when jigging away from weeds). It is best kept for ripping bucktail jigs through weeds.
807297,Ralph Field,2013-09-11 12:57:00,1018,"Shimano 5'9"" extra fast stiff spinning rod."
807304,adempsey,2013-09-11 13:35:00,1498,"When I looked for a jig rod I aimed for a 6' 3"" medium extra fast or fast rod.   I got lucky and found a G Loomis WJR 752S 6' 3"" medium fast action on sale.  It's my favorite rod."
807337,bigreddog,2013-09-11 18:00:00,84,"I've been mostly alternating between a Megabass Kirisame Limited F1-66ZKS (6'6"" with an extra-fast solid tip) and a Megabass DirectZ F2-70XSD (7' interline rod with a fast tip), depending on weather and water conditions."
807347,bigbuck,2013-09-11 19:26:00,2449,I have a 6'6 Fenwick Elite Tech jigging rod. Ml action with a fast tip. Love it. I would not go longer than that for an in boat rod. Anything from 6 to 6 1/2 ft in an ml action. Med is a bit too heavy for jigging.
807397,captpierre,2013-09-11 23:36:00,2521,Been doing a lot of rip jigging this year.  Looking for as light a rod as possible.  Hard on the arms otherwise
807408,2 tone z71,2013-09-12 00:31:00,1311,"I use the St Croix Eyecon,,works well"
807460,porkpie,2013-09-12 12:56:00,2521,"Another vote for the st. Croix eyecon series, I have a couple now and I love em!"
807810,scugpg,2013-09-15 00:40:00,1373,st croix eyecon series 6'3 ml or m xfast action.  for higher end st croix legend tournament in 6'3 ml or m xfast.
808286,musky_hunter,2013-09-18 03:35:00,328,"I've been using the Simax Exclusive 6'6"" MH rods all this year for walleye"
808287,Stoty,2013-09-18 03:40:00,2910,"The Exclusive's are still on clearance for 40% off as well! Unreal prices right now. PM me if you're looking for any, and I'll hook you up."
808294,Moosebunk,2013-09-18 05:38:00,3970,Ugly Stix and Lightning Rods... Bamboo Series.  Seriously though... there's too many good to great options for simply jiggin' up eyes.
808299,porkpie,2013-09-18 10:49:00,2521,"Hey man, I used 7 foot lightning  stick for years as my number one live bait rod!!  Good stuff! I still use ugly sticks when I need a rod I can step on!  LOL"
