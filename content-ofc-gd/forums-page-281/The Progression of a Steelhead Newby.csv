405281,laszlo,2009-11-25 00:09:00,487, pound for pound the best fighting fish i've ever caught. straight up! thanks for getting me started Miagi.

405352,[email protected],2009-11-25 05:06:00,290, It looks like red hooks to me.
405363,laszlo,2009-11-25 11:34:00,487," yes, they are red hooks."
406591,laszlo,2009-11-29 13:51:00,487,Haven't had the chance to get out this weekend. Worked Saturday and today is my wife Anna's 33rd birthday. Here comes Monday to the rescue!  The weather forecast has been all over the place. Now with the rain coming today I'm left with a situation regarding where to go. The spot I've been fishing as of late will more then likely be too stained on Monday depending on how much rain actually falls.  It might be time to try one of these gin clear eastern ditches I keep hearing about.  Hopefully a successful report to follow Monday evening.
406773,lucabrasi,2009-11-29 23:42:00,114," Not so fast on the rain thing. It changed again. Originally they were forecasting 5-10. Now it's only five, which means we'll get 2   Seems to be the theme this year."

407320,azebra,2009-12-01 14:49:00,168,"BIG FLOATS. my rod is rated 1/8  - 3/8 Oz, 3/8th is 10g,  so I dont go bigger to 12 or 14g. can I? but then wont my rod me to bouncy? i have a raven IM8 14ft.. when i first started, i used a 20g piker on the niagara. thats way to large isnt it?"
407331,BillM,2009-12-01 15:30:00,17367," You rod isn't going to be 'bouncy' when you are drifting, lol..   I use whatever float I need to in order to get the bait down and get it down quick.  If you are fishing big, fast water you need a big float and lots of shot..  The only ratings they should put on float rods are the line ratings"
407333,Paulus,2009-12-01 15:38:00,522," Correctomundo. And no, a 20g Piker on the niagara - when you are fishing slip float - is not too big, provided you have enough weight & the conditions allow for it. i.e. if you're only fishing in about 10' of water and the water is pretty clear, the Piker is overkill. But some sections of the Glen have over 20' - in spots like that the Piker is a great way to enable you to put on enough weight so that your bait gets down fast and stays down. All you need to do is slip the stop up and down, depending on the depth you need to fish at.  p.-"
414157,laszlo,2009-12-21 14:39:00,487,"After a very difficult attempt on Sunday, I thought I should bring this thread back to life. Last minute I decided to fish a river I hadn't been to since mid November. Water levels were up a bit and the forecast was calling for a calm not so cold day. This area lacks depth a bit so the water being a little higher was good.  I drove into town to see the water looked great! I don't fish in town though as it's wide open and too many anglers. Once I got to my spot things looked crazy. The banks had plenty of ice, which I expected, but there was also a ton of slushy ice being washed down river exactly at the spots I needed to cast. I continued on...  After three hours I went 0/0 fishing next to impossible conditions. The slush was everywhere preventing my float to sit right and my bait from getting down below the surface properly.  I understand that timing is everything when it comes to Steelheading and I'll be the first to say that I was way off on this one. Lesson learned.   This was one of the pools that didn't have as much slush washing down but it's not the best spot and lacks depth.     As I approached this pool I could see that it was next to impossible to fish. See the line of ice coming down. That's exactly where the fish are.     The best pool there, that had produced most of my catches earlier in the year, wasn't even close to fishable. It's the main artery of the river and everything was washing down there.   Till next time... Thanks for reading.  Laz"

404776,laszlo,2009-11-23 00:18:00,487,"Up to this point, early in my Steelheading ventures, I’ve fished areas that have been recommended by others. This was the first attempt that I picked a spot that I felt would hold fish. The River isn’t necessarily proven…well at least not this area, but I had a feeling.  Highdrifter (Fidel) and I decided that today was the day to give it a shot. When we arrived optimism was high which slowly faded. We worked every possible structure feeling like fish were there but no hits. It wasn’t until 3 hours later that the work paid off and we found a spot that looked prime.  And it paid off…  First, I caught this strong fighting male.       Followed by an acrobatic little female.      Sure, Fidel was feeling happy for me but felt like we needed to stick around just a bit longer. He finished the day with this beauty and we decided not to take another cast and end it on a major high.           Lot's of info gathered in this new Steelheading spot which surely will lead to another successful attempt.  Mission Complete.  The Progression Continues..."

I mean...we all love the sounds of more fish right?  And to be clear, I don't think anyone has an issue with saying ""A RIVER"". Clearly Steelhead are caught in ""A RIVER"".  Now I'm off to fish...which is what this is all really about. I say we keep it that way. Sounds good to me."

Ended the mild, somewhat damp morning 1 for 2.  My friend Cam went 1 for 1 and caught this fresh fish full of attitude.     No pics of my catch. A 3lb male that was training for the Olympics for Vertical Stiff Jumping. Another high energy fish.  At least 10 fish came up for flies or something on the surface during the morning. They were coming up almost in slow motion just to say hello. I wish I had a fly rod. Oh snap...let's take it one method at a time.  Till Monday...weather permitting. Now back to work."

402329,laszlo,2009-11-15 12:27:00,487,   Anyone notice the egg trail falling out of this fish??? How common are the fall spawners?
402349,wallacio,2009-11-15 13:50:00,475," Again, congrats on your first fish!  Fall spawners are relatively common and are usually stocked fish which originated in a NY hatchery where they manipulate the photoperiod in order to induce fall spawning characteristics so that eggs may be taken in the fall.    Based on the appearance of your fish's dorsal fin which is somewhat deformed (a common trait of hatchery fish due to crowding in the rearing pens) it's probably safe to assume that fish came from one of these NY hatcheries."
402453,laszlo,2009-11-15 22:29:00,487,GEAR UPDATE:  #12 Hooks Micro Swivels 5.6 lb Flourocarbon Leaders  Up to this point I've been using larger hooks tied straight on to 8lb Flourocarbon main line. Going fishing Monday morning for a few hours. We'll see if this improvement in gear leads to more fish. It is going to be tough though with clear low water conditions.
402464,StoneFly,2009-11-15 22:58:00,574,"Gettin better all the time, although, I wouldnt reccomend that Raven Leader,...they make quality rods,..but I have lost way too many fish on their leader,...I have always been a fan of Drennan (owned by Raven) and although the diameter is huge for the line rating, it rarely lets me down.  Recently I became a fan of Froghair also.  Try Drennan 3lb or Froghair 6.6 lb (same diameter, hence the diameter of the leader is usually more important than the lb test quoted) for the slower clear conditions.  You can go lower and land small fish, but when you get the big one on,..you will wish you hadn't.  Also, that location we have pm'd about can stand Drennan 4lb ,5lb, and even 6lb leader almost anytime due to how dirty it usually is.  cheers, good luck.  Forgot to mention, Hook type/brand is important also, some are alot stronger than others, and go to #14 in the clearer conditions.  When the brute gets on, even if your leader is well suited, if your hook sucks, it may bend and still cause you to lose fish,...this has happened to me MANY times.  That being said, I prefer to lose a fish this way than with a broken leader and hook stuck in the fish's yap."

402594,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-11-16 03:01:00,0,"in my steelhead infancy i was told similar info to this:  ""when fish are biting, you can toss spoons in the morning and any kind of float presentation much of the day and have results.  when fishing is slower, pick a leader and a hook you think might be JUST too small, and go one size smaller.""  this gent's steelhead career was in VERY small tribs, very short runs, and very clear/shallow water...  p.s. i like raven 4.5 lb."
402599,fishinguypat,2009-11-16 03:18:00,547,i just got 8 lb and 6lb fluorocarbon ... the six is the thinnest line i have  ever used i think its 0.08 mm or lower

402605,danc,2009-11-16 03:40:00,4677,"Great thread guys. Steelheading has certainly come a long way since I cut my teeth on a few local rivers in the early 70's. The ultimate setup back then on the north shore of Superior was a Fenwick fiberglass fly rod (8' was good. 9' was better) suited up with Martin 72  multiplying fly reel loaded with 10 lb. test Stren mono. Bottom bouncing with a stream side tied yarn fly was the ticket. We used to have a sinker pouring party each spring. 3/8 oz. egg sinkers were the choice. We'd go through thousands of them back in the day. And we caught fish. Lots of fish. In my hay day I used to catch a few hundred fish per spring. Times have certainly changed. It seems that you need a long rod and and expensive line holder to be successful now.  I don't know why that is. I don't fish Steelhead in the traditional way way anymore, but I can catch a bunch with a 7 or 8 ' spinning setup when I'm so inclined. I'm guessing that I've caught well over 1000 Steelhead in my day and not one has been caught on a float setup. I wonder what Steelhead fishing will be like 30 years from now?"
402607,Twocoda,2009-11-16 03:41:00,4130, Thanks Bill i was going to go look at the box ...but i was too lazy.....Just curious ...  Spell check for Daiichi  Daiquiri Dairying Daisie Daimler
402608,Twocoda,2009-11-16 03:46:00,4130,  sit at a computer and operate a mechanical fishing dude so you dont even have to leave the house   or go to the supermarket and buy farmed fish suitable for consumption

402615,StoneFly,2009-11-16 04:04:00,574," Ummmm Dan,...Are you talking North Superior?  My guess is the next spot in 30 years is the moon,..they just discovered water there dont you know lol"
402622,danc,2009-11-16 04:24:00,4677,"There's no Steelhead on the moon. Only Brook Trout. But we will plant them there just because we can, and because it will be convenient for some people to catch them there. And thus, the moon will be ruined too. We discovered water on the moon just last week. Look for invasive species to be there in a month or two."
402627,fishinguypat,2009-11-16 05:12:00,547,  wait its actually 0.09 mm and what do you mean pairing it with 12 lb mono?

401547,justin elia,2009-11-12 01:29:00,151,"Lazlo,   First off, great thread!  I'm sure many anglers, new to steelheading, are learning as well.  Below is a link to shotting patterns.  90% of the time, I will bulk shot.  I would also suggest one of two things, 1) wait for a decent amount of rain so that the rivers rise and fish them while they drop and clear up (your chances of hitting some fish will be higher), and 2) if you are adament on hooking into a steelhead before we get rain, target the estuaries and river mouths.  Fish will move in and out waiting until the rivers rise so they can make their way upstream.  Good luck.    http://www.anglersinternational.com/Shotting%20Patterns.pdf"
401548,Twocoda,2009-11-12 01:30:00,4130,"Las ...pick up a couple more colours of netting ...natural /pink/red mix up the colours till you find whats working chartreuse and white are prominent colours for here ...but you arent here  when i go to other areas i usually have an arsenal of colours until i figure out whats working ....  man are you ever going to appreciate your first hook up....keep it up "" it will happen"""

That being said,..you dont always have to wait for a rain if you know where to go.  What I would do on one river is extremely different from what I would do on another, not too mention different holes on a given river,...given the same rain patterns....take an inch of rain and some rivers arent fishable for days, some are immediately.  Some are always so dirty you can stand with a clown suit on and not spook the fish, others you have to hide bigtime,...then theres the rigging and bait differences,...blah blah blah,...you will learn dude,..you mentioned DMASSE, he knows his stuff, I have learned ALOT from him and I dare say he has learned a little from me,...but I kicked his butt a couple times under tough conditions...that being said,..he beats me 10x more,..not that its a competition...lol..."

Earlier this week Fidel was saying to me he was thinking of taking you out to try to get you into some fish...Glad he did  Once you hook your first one, there's no stopping the urge for another, or another  Steelheading is like an addiction which can't be cured...My own life has been spiraling out of control mainly because of my need for chrome steel"

402178,laszlo,2009-11-14 17:45:00,487,"First cast and my float went down, I set the hook, 'thought' I had a fish on to realize it was just a snag. Couldn't get it off and ended up braking my line but right at the hook so I just had to re-tie a new one. Next cast and...float goes down again, set the hook and...fish on!!! One nice jump and brought her to the bank. Beauty 3.5 pound female with great colours. Picked her up for a couple pics to see eggs were coming out of her. Let her go.  15 minutes later Fidel (Highdrifter) hooks a fish. Very little fight. Once we got her to the bank Fidel says ""is this the same fish you just caught?"" Looked exactly the same, didn't have much energy and eggs dropping out of her. Let her go again.  This was around 7am and I stayed until 8:20. Off to work. Fidel will be sending me pics this evening."

400781,laszlo,2009-11-09 23:53:00,487," Nice meeting you as well Dave. Thanks for all the info and help with the set up. Your patience was really appreciated.  I'm not sure what was off exactly. I know my floats were way too small and light. The current was making it sink and tilt on weird angles all day. I'm going to get some longer, heavier ones for bigger, faster water. I've never fished rapids that intense before so it was kind of new to me."
400790,Musky or Specks,2009-11-10 00:18:00,2710,Incredible important tool for steelheading is a thermometer. When the water is cold fish mid to tailout but if the temp of the water climbs even a little fish the whole pool even run water. Ive had days in december that water was 33 degrees first thing and temps climbed a degree and half and boom lots of fish.
400801,chandru,2009-11-10 00:38:00,63,"hey man just don't give up when i first started fishing i went 2 years only catching sunfish, sometimes not even! only in my 3rd year did things really pick up along with increase in knowledge the right conditions and the right gear!"
400807,laszlo,2009-11-10 00:59:00,487," It's not fishing I'm having trouble with. Pike, Bass, Walleye, Resident Trout = NO PROBLEMS!  Steelheading is an entire different situation. No worries though. I'll put in the time which will eventually pay off."
400875,BillM,2009-11-10 03:54:00,17367,In fast water you'll want to upsize your float and bulk shot...  The key is to get it down quickly and keep it there..  Running small floats is a waste of time in those conditions.  I've made that mistake on way to many occasions..
400880,StoneFly,2009-11-10 04:09:00,574,"Unless that fast water is the only hole out of many on the stretch you are fishing,...you can also adjust how you drift, keep your line tight and rely on the 'feel' of the hit.  In my experience the Big fish dont sit in the middle of the rapid,..is the mid to smaller ones,..especially at this time of year when the water is cold enough to hold the O2.  Once you have rigged heavier, it is difficult to downsize for the next pool without retying.  I would suggest just adding a couple micro's to the leader in rapid section, move your float up.  when you are done with it,...you can either retie your leader only or slide the micros up to the swivel and slide you float back down.  Make sure when you cast that your bait lands directly down stream from you float.   this is always important, but utmost in fast water."
400881,BillM,2009-11-10 04:11:00,17367,"Buy a pair of decent pliers to remove the shot if you need to downsize...  I can fish the 'Geen one day, then the Notty and not have to re-rig.  I hate re-rigging, so I do whatever I can to avoid it."
400890,StoneFly,2009-11-10 04:20:00,574," I personally re-rig every outing and well even more for those slingshot mishaps with trees above, lol.  those little nics in your main line from sticks, rocks and any number of things can cause you to lose fish,..removing the shot will for sure weaken your line.  I also like to get 20 ft or so of water soaked line off every time I re-rig.  just a preference that i find works for me.   In fact with regards to the leader, the fish I lost Sunday in wood was on a leader I had already battled a smaller fish plus on bird nested once.  Last way I want to see my rig is not top notch is on a big fish lost when it could have been."
400956,laszlo,2009-11-10 12:46:00,487, I'm glad you guys brought this up.  I've been using the Raven pack of multi size split shots. I realize once they're pinched you can't remove them.  Scenario:  Fishing 9 feet of fast moving water and bulk shotting my rig. Then I decide to move slightly down river where the water changes to 5 feet and slowing down a bit.  Question:  Do I have to re-rig everything for the change in conditions???   Thanks
400959,MJL,2009-11-10 12:57:00,2427," I use the split shots called ""Sure Shot"" (Got them on sale in bulk for cheap)...I normally just slide the shots up and down the mainline to get whatever shotting pattern I need (I might switch floats and add more shots if need be).  If my shots are rigged evenly spaced between the leader and the float and I need to get down fast to fish faster water, I just slide them down and clump a bunch together just above the leader (I do put a few small shots on my leader though which most people don't)...Not sure how hard the Raven shots are but some shots do fray and crimp the line as you slide them up and down (always check for line damage)."
400964,timmeh,2009-11-10 13:10:00,609," I use the same shots, I just don't pinch them on overly tight, that way I can move them around to avoid re-rigging if possible. Sometimes however if you're changing from very different conditions you'll have no choice but to re-rig.  As MJL mentioned if you're moving shots around make sure to check your line for frays every now and then."
400967,StoneFly,2009-11-10 13:27:00,574,"Just position the shots so you can move your float as low as 5' from your hook,...then you can move it as high as you want.  moving the shot around by sliding it helps for some drifts, but no you shouldnt have to re-rig."
400970,laszlo,2009-11-10 13:37:00,487,I guess I'm pinching my shots way too tight. Once I pinched them there was no way they would move. I was also looking at the shot patterns Bill linked on here earlier and it seems I was using a pattern for slower moving water in 9 feet of insane rapids.  Looking forward to another attempt and hoping this info hooks me my first fish.  Stay tuned...
400978,BillM,2009-11-10 14:08:00,17367," 9ft of insane rapids?  lol  You'll want a monster float (11-14g) and a lot of shot right above your tippet (Even some dust shot on your leader never hurt)  The thing is, you don't want to fish IN the fast water, you want to fish the seam right besides it..  And like Stonefly said earlier, fishing this type of water is a bit tricky..  You'll feel the hits before you actually see the float go down.  You need to make sure you are trotting (keeping the line a bit taught as the float goes downstream) and pay attention.   Any time the float bobbles, or does somethig funky, set the hook..  These hits are extremely easy to miss.  I had a hell of a day a few weeks ago fishing similar water.. After a few tips from a buddy the next time out, nailed a bunch."
400983,tonyb,2009-11-10 14:25:00,1637,"Great thread...it's fun reliving the learning curve through your post laszlo...you're well on your way to success.  The Internet is an amazing tool for anglers isn't it?  I learned by watching successful guys, being patient, practicing and experimenting and asking a LOT of questions to whoever would talk to me on the water  Good luck this weekend...it's can only get better bud and remember etiquette first, fish second  Tony"
400990,MJL,2009-11-10 14:47:00,2427," You could always try bottom bouncing the fast water provided it isn't too snaggy – I like doing this.  I do quite well fishing artificials like plastic minnows, plastic worms, plastic eggs, sponge eggs, yarn flies, bigger flies with stiff hackles, etc.  You can also try what Bill mentioned…Big floats (11gr to ?) and use a ton of lead (split shots, slinkies, pencil lead, bass worm weights, etc) to get down to the bottom.  When I fish the Niagara (fairly fast water and deep in a lot of places), I carry an assortment of floats (mostly slip floats) ranging in size from 11gr to 28gr (I think).  This spring when I was down there, I set my float to 25-30ft and launched it in the middle of no where in the really fast stuff and got into a few fish – Really made me rethink about the way I cover water.  Really liking the big blackbird balsa slip-floats and the Raven slip floats for big fast water - I destroyed way too many Drennans   .  For size reference, the 2 floats on the left are what I normally use for small/med sized Lake O tribs...The other floats with a stack of shots on them are for the Niagara and pier fishing "
401001,dave524,2009-11-10 15:15:00,4508,"I learned a lot from watching the fish as to where to fish in a run. Get a set of polaroids and a good vantage point like a bridge or a high bank above a hole where you can look down and see the fish, watch them. You will see patterns of movement and resting places.  Get to know a couple of stretches of a few rivers well under different conditions. Once you have got their holding patterns down you can apply it to unfamiliar waters. Take a break and sit close  to some one who is obviously successful and watch, like I tell my daughter "" if you see some one who is more successful than you it is probably because he/she is doing something your not "" Think you got the basics of rigging down, it's in the application now."
401015,[email protected],2009-11-10 16:02:00,290,Someone should draw up some sample rigs in MSPAINT or photoshop  I'm having trouble following the correct way to put the float/sinkers on.

401158,laszlo,2009-11-11 00:10:00,487,Tied my own roe bags for the first time this evening and am heading out to give them a shot tomorrow. For some reason I have a good feeling.

401512,StoneFly,2009-11-12 00:35:00,574,"Weird, that spot is usually hopin by now, did you go where you told me (dont post it here).  If So, did you walk the stretch or just fish by where you parked?"

398444,thalweg,2009-11-02 00:14:00,112,"A 7 foot medium action rod is ok if thats all you have.  A longer rod provides for greater presentation control and enables you to use lighter line and finesse setups for wary steelhead.  Mind you, if your just starting out...going light will help you get more hookups. 8lb mainline and 4-6lb flouro leader with 12-14 size trout hooks.   As you become more experienced and really want to experience a great high impact fight...then you can move up to heavier setups with 11lb flourocarbon leader and 65lb braid mainline and size 6 even 4 hooks.  If there is any piece of advice I can give you...is time on the water.  Just go...as often as you can and keep your eye out on the other fishermen on the river.  You'll see a wide variety of tactics and presentations. Its not as hard as you think it is...and it has more to do with timing your trips when fish have made the move up the river.  Search some other posts relating to steelhead. There's some great info and methods from a lot of different perspectives.    Cheers"
398445,Paully,2009-11-02 00:15:00,712,I starthed steelhead fishing with a 9'6 fenwick and a spinning reel.. it dident cost too much (around a hundred bucks). It was good for drifting pools and throwing hardware.
398465,Hellfish,2009-11-02 00:46:00,308,"If you ever want to come fish the Niagara shoot me a pm, ill show you some tricks"
398479,MJL,2009-11-02 01:17:00,2427," Like ‘Musky or Specks’ mentioned, your set-up sounds just perfect for tossing spinners and lures to steelhead.  My favourite set-up for spinner fishing small to medium sized tribs is a:  -	7ft Shimano Convergence (3pc) rated (8-17lb) but has a soft tip with a very meaty butt section.  Handles lines down to 4lb just fine -	2000 Shimano Stradic -	6-8lb mono (I hate fluorocarbon mainlines…They are a pain to use)  When fishing bigger rivers with spinners or lures, I bump up to a 9’ medium light or medium action spinning rod (Rated 6-10 or 8-12lb).  I find with shorter rods while fishing small to medium sized rivers, I can pitch the lures more accurately to spots than I can with a longer rod and I can actually feel the spinner blades ‘sing’ as I retrieve it.  I don’t find that I’m seriously hindered by the shorter length of the rod…If anything, it makes tailing fish a heck of a lot easier as well as bushwacking.  I often carry both my float rod and my 7’ spinning rod when I fish.  My spinner selection is pretty basic.  Mepps, Vibrax, Olympique and ones I made myself in Size 1-4   A 6-7’ medium action spinning rod handles fresh steel just fine   My 5’6” ultra-lite handled this one pretty well too   Steelheading isn’t just a pastime, it’s an addiction.  Instead of buying a pack of smokes like some people, I just buy a pack of pink worms or hooks instead   .  Like others have mentioned already, go out to one of your local rivers and chat with some of the other anglers.  Most steelheaders I meet on the rivers are for the most part polite and willing to give tips to others who ask.  95% of the time when I ask another angler how it's going, I get a straight up answer with a list of things that worked or didn't.  Pick their brains every opportunity you can and learn."
398513,muddler,2009-11-02 02:11:00,623,"Ok, let's cut to the chase. Back to the original question.  It really doesn't matter much what gear you use for steelhead as long as you can present your offering in a natural way. Spinners and plugs are an exception to this as they are usually retrieved upstream. Roe, worms and flies (and thier derivatives) must be presented as naturally as conditions allow to consistently catch fish. This usually means using smaller hooks (6-14) light leaders (usually florocarbon) in the 4-8 lb range and the lightest float and shot that will get you bait into the strike zone. Usually downstream.  Each river system is different. Some of the ""ditches"" in the east of the GTA are easier to fish than some of the larger Georgian Bay rivers. The east rivers are usually narrower and the deeper spots where you cannot see the bottom wil hold fish at some time or other. Any wood debris  or other materials that offer overhead cover will also hold fish. The drifts on these eastern rivers is usually shorter than larger flows, so finding productive spots is usually easier. I once saw a fellow use a 5 ft ultra light outfit with a float and he was nailing one fish after another. Not my weapon of choice but it worked for this guy. His presentation was very good. He would bump the same tree on every drift and often he'd hook up. He lost alot of fish too.  Rivers like the Nottawasaga, Saugeen and Maitland to name a few, are a whole differnt story. Longer casts and much longer drifts are manditory most of the time here. You still have to have a natural drift to catch steelhead constently, but a short rod can make that a lot more difficult. The longer rod make it a lot easier. The float reel has become the reel of choice, but a lot of very good fishermen still prefer the spinning reel and yes a few  use baitcasters.  Use the best equipment that you can afford. Not everyone can drop $1500 for a state of the art float reel and rod. Learn how to present your offering in the most natural way and you will catch fish, lots of them.  I think that every fisherman/fisherwoman should be forced to fly fish for 2 years before they fish any other type of gear (LOL). It would force you to fish your offering as naturally as possible or you just catch much. I know I learned how to read the water much better after I learned to fly fish. My presention of the fy had to be as natuaral as possible to consistently catch fish. I would use this knowledge for many other spicies later.  8 or 10 lb mainlines are the norm. 2 to 8 lb florocarbon leaders and small hooks are the norm too. Use the heavies leader that conditions allow. The clearer the water the lighter the leader. Some guys prefer mono leaders but I like the duarbility of florocarbon.. Shot patterns vary for each condtion. The link posted earlier in this thread had some good ones. Use good knots that you confidence in. I use the Orivis tippet knot to join floro leaders to mainline and the Orvis knot for tying hooks and flies to the leader. They hold extremly well for me.  Use a variety of baits. Don't fall in love with one type of bait (I've done that too many times). If most guys are using roe without success. try a worm or fly or jig. Some days are just better than others. Sometimes the fish are just not there. Watch the guys that are successfull. Where they fish, how they fish and what they use. Watch the water for indicators of life. Are the insects active? Are the minnows being chased? get a thermomater. A rising temperature indicated greater activity of the fish. I use rising to 50 degrees F as my switch over temperature. I'll use woolly buggers, bigger pink worms and larger stone flies then. A dropping or low temp I go with egg clusters (I like the fake bead ones) and single egg flies or beads. 3 inch pinkies and jig round out  my choices. I use those whenever I want or if nothing else is working. All of these are presented as naturally as possible with a short swing on a tight line at the end of the drift.  You may have noticed the ""natural presentation"" theme over and over again. Often it's not what you are using but rather how you use it. Don't be intimidated into believing that they is jsut one way to do it. I remenber about 20 years ago when everyone in my neck of the woods would never use anythin lighter than 15 lb test for walleye and a heavy pike leader and a bait casting outfit. Now 8lb is the norm and no leader. Mediun to light action rods ranging fro 7 to 9 ft now. But a long as a natural pesention can be made, fish will be caught. The same goes for rainbows.   muddler"
398515,ehg,2009-11-02 02:30:00,2666,"Great post Muddler! Lots learned there, but being where there is fish is most important and what i find to be the hard part.  Too bad about most of this thread turned into a hissyfit, a lot of new knowledge could be gained. Maybe the self indulgent crap can be deleted?"
398520,Twocoda,2009-11-02 02:41:00,4130,muddler - nice post for information for the new steelheader- good on ya
398745,laszlo,2009-11-02 21:16:00,487,"I went to JB's Fishing Depot today. What a difference dealing with people who love fishing, giving good service and helping people out.  Rod of choice: Raven 13' 6"" 3pc IM-6  Should be in by Friday and ready to put to use next week. Also took a look at some Center Pins. Next spring I'll deal with that beast. Probably get an Islander of some sort.  I will report back after my first try at it."
398884,StoneFly,2009-11-03 02:32:00,574,"Good Work bud,...I agree learning to catch these fish with a spinning reel for a season will help you for sure,..then next year you can have all of the Frustration with the Pin,...lol  Fighting them on the pin is absolutely awesome in comparison"
399380,laszlo,2009-11-04 17:26:00,487,"After some research and recommendations, it's looking like I will be going with the Raven 13' or 14' IM-8. Wish I could find it in stock though. Would love to fish this weekend but I may have to wait until next week."
399382,young_one,2009-11-04 17:35:00,620,I highly recommend checking out the classified section of OFC and floatfishing.net and other forums. There can be some good deals on rods and reels.
399388,solopaddler,2009-11-04 17:58:00,8605, Excellent choice on the IM8 over the IM6. If I were you I'd go with the 13'er.
399406,laszlo,2009-11-04 19:26:00,487, Looks like I may have found a 13'er in stock which means this weekend will be the first time using a rod longer then 6.5'. I imagine it will feel kind of weird at first. Even weirder when I match it up with a center pin next spring.  Let's bow our heads for a moment to the fishing gods praying that I catch my first Steelhead this weekend.
399409,gogu392,2009-11-04 19:36:00,142,"I have an Okuma 13'6"" used once. Paid $160+tax. See PM for more details. Give me $80 and is yours. I like baitcaster games, no steelhead. I am from Toronto."
399818,laszlo,2009-11-05 23:47:00,487,13' Raven IM-8 bought today and ready for use. Sunday can't come soon enough!
399821,StoneFly,2009-11-05 23:55:00,574," Just a thought,..dont focus on seeing them.  The ones you will catch you will not see beforehand.  Focus more on reading the water,..and think,...""if i was a steelhead,...where would I be?"""

399910,Twocoda,2009-11-06 03:33:00,4130,Good stuff on the purchase Laz....now you WILL hook up with a bow this weekend but ....will you land your first????     not many people do ....the fish this year are very healthy and strong ...you will need all of your new rod to get them onshore.
399912,BillM,2009-11-06 03:42:00,17367,"I got real lucky and landed my first fish on a pin (It was all of about 3lbs, lol)  Just take it easy and don't horse it."
399913,StoneFly,2009-11-06 03:44:00,574," A Weeeee  bit Postitive,..but I guess the take home message would be CONFIDENCE,....that is huge!!!  you have to have the right gear, and you need to be with fish,..and you need to do it right,....but then you also need to know when the float just moves a bit,...to set it or not,..considering it could be a snag and you may have some retying time ....you will figure it out...  lookin forward to the pics   you will start to realize your zone and perfect drifts,....I persnally like to call it the Babe Ruth... when you know you casted a perfect drift and you call a fish hitting it,...I get it around half the time...lol, when i know the fish are there that is...lol"
399970,ricoboxing,2009-11-06 13:24:00,398,"i caught a bunch of steelhead in the spring with my 5'6"" ugly stik, 8lb test using the small berkely pink trout worms and some tiny split shot.  Just found a pool, drift and let the worm bounce along the bottom.  you can have the most expensive setups but it dosent matter what you use if you're fishing in pools that don't hold any fish."
400707,laszlo,2009-11-09 19:27:00,487,Went 0 for 0 on Sunday but did learn a lot in the way of set up. What I was doing before was way off. Also learned that having a variety of floats is a must. The ones I brought were way too small for the fast water.  So the progression continues along at a slow pace but it continues...
400735,douG,2009-11-09 21:15:00,2693,"This is a great thread, Laszlo.  I bet that everyone who has read it will keep coming back looking for the *bingo* update.  Best of luck."
400776,Twocoda,2009-11-09 23:38:00,4130, its kinda funny now in retrospect...the river was literally on fire last week ...saturday slowed a bit as the water cleared ....Sunday ( when Laz came up) the water was even clearer...but still pleanty of fish ...i went 0 for two in the bow sector but did land a chrome salmon ( weird year)...   Laz ....next ttime ill take you elsewhere sooner if the bite isnt hot right away...was good to meet you ...maybe the water temp was off or something ... would you concur ?
398297,laszlo,2009-11-01 12:25:00,487,"This fall is the first time I've attempted targetting Steelhead. Starting off with little knowledge has had many factors working against me. This has led to 3 outings that have produced ZERO fish.  Gear:  6 foot Medium Action Spinning Rod. 10 lb Mono Line Big Float Big Hook  What more could I be doing wrong???  In the next week I plan on buying a 13' Float Rod and will be using my spinning reel for now and purchasing a Center Pin next Spring.  Got some small trout hooks.  I re-spooled my reel with 8 lb 100% Flourocarbon.  Plan on buying some smaller slip floats.  Now I just need to get out to understand reading the water to determine where fish are holding. Regardless of success, I'll be reporting back after every outing. Let's hope this leads to posts with lots of pics."
398300,Musky or Specks,2009-11-01 12:53:00,2710,With the 6 foot rod you might be better off utilizing other techniques than floatfishing. Try spinners and wobbling plugs on fresh fish. Keep at it and pick one river to learn to start with.
398303,raptorfan,2009-11-01 13:36:00,126,"Ultyma and myself are also going steelheading for the first time this morning Laszlo.  I am sure our learning curve will be just as steep as yours.  I will let you know if we find anything that works, or we learn something interesting."
398308,[email protected],2009-11-01 14:00:00,290, Yup!.  BTW I'm leaving now.... Be there in a bit lol...
398334,BillM,2009-11-01 15:41:00,17367,"Gotta start out with the right equipment if you want to be successful.  I'm not talking about a $1000 float reel and a $1000 custom float rod, but you are really handicapping yourself running the gear you are.  Why not go pick up a cheap Shimano Convergence 10'6 spinning rod?  They are like $80..  This will help greatly with keeping your line off the water when you are trying to make a drift...  Also pick up a few balsa floats (2g, 4g, 8g, 11g) some shot, and a few small hooks (8,10's)..  Read up on shot patterns.  http://www.fishonlineca.com/Float-Fishing/...g-Patterns.html  Get some roe, some bags, maybe some 3"" Gulp pink steelhead worms, a few small jigs etc etc...  Biggest thing I'm still learning is reading the water..  It's great to have someone with you to point out what you should be fishing and what you shouldn't be wasting your time on..."
398337,steelhead197,2009-11-01 15:55:00,38,"I think we all appreciate your honesty........Sometimes people forget how long it takes to become a ""better than average steelheader"". I had alot of days catching nothing when my buddy's were doing well! The most important thing to remember is to keep an open mind and not be stubborn. If something is working....utilize it!! It takes years to become a good steelheader...so be patient and hang in there!! It will come! I think your wasting your time trying to float fish with a 6 foot rod.....Someone suggested getting a 10.5 convergence.....Thats what I started with some 15 years ago. Actually it was a 10.6 Browning and spinning reel!! A set up like this will get you into some fish, until you want to jump in feet first, with a 13 footer and a float reel!! Good luck!!"
398338,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-11-01 16:01:00,0,"another trouble with the short rod, when you manage to hook into one, could be landing it. steelhead make some pretty ferocious runs when they have enough river to do it in which leads to a lot of broken line for newbies. the long rod REALLY puts the advantage back in your court when fighting these bruisers"
398340,Greencoachdog,2009-11-01 16:06:00,8163,I know a fella on this board that does pretty darn good on the steelhead with a spinning rod and reel!  I wonder what they used to catch them with before all this fancy stuff came out???
398342,laszlo,2009-11-01 16:34:00,487,"I just came back from Bass Pro Shop. It was busy, I couldn't get help and the rod selection looked a little lacking. I plan on going back on a weekday to buy a 13ft rod and some accessories."

398350,Paully,2009-11-01 17:17:00,712,  I was there on saturday and i was also disappointed with the rod selection... For such a big store you would think otherwise.  LeBarons had a few that were fairly priced..
398352,wallacio,2009-11-01 17:26:00,475,There are far better places to go than BPS if you are after a float rod.   Give some of the smallers stores (that specialize in this equipment) a try...there are lots of them around in the GTA and Southern Ontario for that matter.
398355,Paully,2009-11-01 17:41:00,712,  Perhaps you could name a few..
398357,wallacio,2009-11-01 17:57:00,475, Would be happy to...is there any particular area of the province that you are close to/interested in?

Also to the OP, maybe take a look into a baitcaster as well (just a option) thats what I use on a 10.5 and 13.5 and I catch just as much fish as anyone else. the spinning gear will work fine though maybe a little cumbersome at times but will definitely work when you get the hang of it."
398384,BillM,2009-11-01 22:36:00,17367,  There is a older gentlemen that fishes the 'Geen with a big rod and a full sized Abu Garcia..  He cleans up all the time

398388,[email protected],2009-11-01 22:42:00,290,I took my 8 foot Berkley Lightning Rod out today and I liked it  I might get a Float Rod/Reel.. depending how addicted I get...  If only we landed a fish
398390,BillM,2009-11-01 22:48:00,17367," 8' isn't bad for smaller creeks/rivers...  I wouldn't worry about landing any fish, if you hook into a few then you know you are doing something right!  Stick to it man, it's a lot of fun once you start to figure things out..  Also, if you want a float setup, buy used..  If you hate it, you won't lose much money at all by reselling it."
398393,[email protected],2009-11-01 22:53:00,290,"  I had a blast today.  We saw the one bow fighting against the current up a REALLY shallow stream. We could have probably netted it, but wheres the fun in that  And we only saw 1 other fish, that was just hanging out in clear water.  I need to get better waders and some more comfortable gear, and I'll be happy to stay out there all day!"
398403,Hellfish,2009-11-01 23:16:00,308,"8ft is alright for the smaller creeks like bill said keep at it, its a load of fun when you start getting it down. Don't forget quickfish and flatfish, k7 or k8 should work. If you think creek fishing for bows is fun , you should try out the Niagara River 16lbs+ is not uncommon."
