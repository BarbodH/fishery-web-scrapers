808644,ch312,2013-09-20 20:29:00,1590," You could be right, but this fish was longer and felt quite a bit heavier than the one I got last week which was 14.5 lbs on the scale.  As for the rod setup, the boat came with those dinky little big jon riggers with single rod holders so I made up this rod holder so I can run 4 rods when someone goes fishing with me. Simply remove the seat from the pipe and plop the rod holder in place using the rigger holders for the divers and the middle two for the riggers. Works very well and I was testing it's strength running two dipseys off it at 3.5 mph while I took the pic.  Trust me, bigger riggers with dual rod holders and a track system with ratcheting rod holders are on the wish list.   I'm glad I pulled the dipseys and switched to riggers or I would have missed the king out there."

808664,SlowPoke,2013-09-20 22:47:00,2984,"You might consider doing what I did. I replaced my downrigger rod holders with Bert's ratcheting rod holders... really slick setup! I mounted a custom plate on top of the Bert's swivel base and then a 17"" track to support the rod holders and the downrigger in between them. You get the benefit of the ratcheting rod holders and the ability to swivel them as if the were part of the rigger like the factory rod holders. Hope that made sense? lol"
