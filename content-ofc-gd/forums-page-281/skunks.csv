808226,davey buoy,2013-09-17 21:06:00,5505,"Three dogs marking there territory,1 female,two males. Never had a case ever .Touch wood. Have had at least two dogs at a time for close to 30 years.Lucky I might guess."
808227,John Bacon,2013-09-17 21:14:00,3277,Skunks eat grubs so controlling the grub population in your lawn should help.  Most chemicals have been banned in Ontario but you can try nematodes.  You probably won't get any benefits until next year.  It the short term; you can try commercial coyote urine scent... I would assume that skunks would want to avoid coyotes.

808250,danc,2013-09-17 22:44:00,4677,They come and go. Some summers are worse than others. It's never been a big deal for me.
808252,manitoubass2,2013-09-17 22:54:00,11391,"We have lots around our yard. I just pay attention when out in the evening our night. They don't hurt anything unless threatened our startled. There are a few people I'd like to smack though openly stating they dip food in antifreeze and leave it on their deck or property, aholes"
808313,outllaw,2013-09-18 12:24:00,1232,well. me and my lab got a dose t-day. . I guess food will be a little off tasting eh.
808334,Beans,2013-09-18 14:36:00,3339,Horrible way for any animal to die...we lost one of our cats 5 years ago due to antifreeze poisoning...shuts down their inner organs and burns their mouths and throats...
808372,manitoubass2,2013-09-18 18:22:00,11391,I think I lost a dog to it as well? Not really sure though. I was told of a person here offering dogs food with anti freeze. But it was just speculation. A few weeks later I found a bone near my boxers house that we hadn't given here. Later that day she could barely walk and appeared blind. Then horrible convulsions. She died in my arms a few hours later with no use of her back legs. Traumatizing. My kids especially. Anyone that would do such a thing is a horrible horrible person
808374,manitoubass2,2013-09-18 18:25:00,11391,"She foamed a lot at the mouth too. But the vet said it could have been poisoned, or she may have had a type of cancer that isn't too rare in boxers. Either way it sure sucked"
808382,jimmer,2013-09-18 19:37:00,2730,"Those skunks are my lawn aerator (?) Hardly ever see them, but they like the grubs, that's for sure."
808383,jimmer,2013-09-18 19:38:00,2730,Why do people move to a rural area/bush area and then proceed to want to kill all the wildlife???
808392,manitoubass2,2013-09-18 20:41:00,11391,Good question jimmer. The wildlife is exactly the reason I love living in the bush
808394,manitoubass2,2013-09-18 20:41:00,11391,Well one of the many reasons
808415,outllaw,2013-09-18 22:13:00,1232,"this striper was on his turf when he got me. dog training has its downside. I heard they use that juice to make perfume. . theres gotta be an easier way to get it in a bottle... have a laff now. ,2 cans of febreeze and still spraying."
808485,mercman,2013-09-19 18:08:00,7054,"I leave a radio playing in my garden shed. Usually on a news or talk chanel. The little stinkers will avoid the sound of a human voice. There are also electronic devises you can buy at most big hardware stores, that you plug in and leave. Works well and I haven't had 1 im my yard this summer."
