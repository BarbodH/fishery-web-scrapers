I'm going to be in St' Pete's for the month of March and being a Canuck I can't be without my hockey fix for that long so I picked up some Lightning tickets to go catch some live hockey over in Tampa. It seems that Tampa is the third cheapest market in the NHL so seating is quite reasonable there. I took in a game last time I was there and had 7 row on the visitors blue line for $90 a seat. Be lucky to get nose bleeds in TO for that price.  So, since I'm going to be there for the whole month I figured I would take in a few games.  I got tickets for the Bruins on March 8th and Canucks on the 17th both sets are 5th row next section closer to the visitors net. I also just picked up tickets in the same section 4th row to watch the Sens lose on the 24th.  The most expensive tickets were Boston (premium team on Saturday night) at $100 a piece. The cheapest were the Sens (anyone really surprised about this?  ) at $45 a piece. With service charges etc my pair of tickets to the Sens/Lightning game were $116.40 US.  "

808345,tb4me,2013-09-18 16:28:00,3295,LOL thats funny.. Sens games should be free..I mean who wants to pay to watch them? lol
808346,DRIFTER_016,2013-09-18 16:30:00,10439, The Sens part of the ticket is free. The Lightning part is $45.   :rofl2:  :rofl2:
808367,Tim Mills,2013-09-18 18:11:00,476,You can't beat the value.  Saw the habs there with the family a few years ago.  Costs us around $80.00 Included in the ticket price was pizza and pop for the family.  Free parking.  Also good pre game and post game party outside the arena.
808370,muskymatt,2013-09-18 18:16:00,2608, We'll see about that after the SENS (Praise Spezza) dominate your laffs this season. Most of the hockey analysts are already picking the laffs to miss the playoffs.
808371,Joey,2013-09-18 18:17:00,9122,  LMAO
808389,bow slayer,2013-09-18 20:19:00,1074,with the crap product the leafs have been putting on the ice for the last 45 plus years...they should be paying the fans to show up at all....but then again leaf fans are suckers for punishment
808403,bobogo,2013-09-18 21:22:00,76," When were hockey analysts right about anything? Armchair is armchair, and nothing else"
808425,bigugli,2013-09-18 23:14:00,6138,it's a Canadian thing.  Just like our government. We love doling out millions of dollar to be fed crap
