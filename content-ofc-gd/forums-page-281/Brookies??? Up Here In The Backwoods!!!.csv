808049,Walleye'm Fishing,2013-09-16 23:55:00,310,"Thanks for the comments gang! Yes indeed, they are naturals. This is the main reason why I only fish this lake once or twice a year. I really don't want to put too much pressure on such a small but magical lake. I've respectfully fished it with great success for the last 20 years and hopefully for the next 20 as well."
