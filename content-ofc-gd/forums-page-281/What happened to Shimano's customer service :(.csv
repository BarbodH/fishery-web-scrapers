807690,musky_hunter,2013-09-13 20:08:00,328,"This is why i only buy rods from few manufacturers / tackle store that goes out of their way to help me as a paying customer. Bring in my broken rod, they give me a replacement and they get their replacement from the manufacturer. If a charge is needed then so be it but at least i don't have to wait a few months !"
807693,lew,2013-09-13 20:22:00,12766,"I've been using Shimano gear for many years and have always found it to be excellent. I've had to have a few items repaired at the P'Boro office and have always been very pleased with their service. Couple years back I had a Calcutta that stopped working and dropped it off to them and picked it up the next day. It was made like new again and there was no charge. It wasn't under warranty, but was still a freebee.  Sad to hear these stories now of how the service is no longer what it used to be."
807779,sauce,2013-09-14 15:22:00,219,"I've got a funny story about how a dummy broke my compre. I almost cried. I'll leave those details out... but I shrugged it off and brought it in to my local tackle shop. Over the counter replacement / upgrade to the new ""walleye"" series. Phew, don't like the way the foam handle compres balance. This was back in April. I'm a satisfied customer.  So your broken cumara...  is it the new style or an old one?  I suspect that stock on old model cumara is low.  I don't buy shimano gear because of how it looks, price, or for the warranty. 100 percent performance. Their reels are solid. Their rods are light and strong. If you break one it's almost a guarantee that someone that handled that rod at some point did something they shouldn't have. A sharp impact might crack the blank.  All you have to is load it up on back cast and snap!!! Graphite + impact=damage."
807889,buckhorn250,2013-09-15 21:08:00,85,"I thought I would provide a bit of an update. Did take the advice to post on TackleTour and received this response from Shimano Rep. Although not a great response and a bit deflective...they did respond. Will let you know what happens.  From Shimano Rep  You have every right to be discouraged. Currently US Customs is holding a container full of rods for inspection. They are saying it will be a 3 week hold...unfortunately this is completely out of our control. Since all of the rods ship from our location to Canada, they have less control over the situation. We are at the mercy of customs on this one. The backorder situation is something we are trying to improve. Demand caught us off guard and due to lead times with the factory we simply cannot speed up production. We anticipated this container to show up last week which obviously has not happened due to the problem I discussed above. Unfortunately there is nothing I can do to speed this process up and get your rod back any sooner. The dates the CS rep sees on the computer are generic. They will update daily/weekly/monthly depending on the date of the PO. More than likely the rod will be here sooner than October. Given your original rod order was placed earlier, the rep should try to move your new order up in time. If you send me a PM with your info I will see what I can do. I will send the info up to Canada and maybe they can bump your order up.I also wanted to add that we respond to every email we receive. More than likely the response when to your junk or spam folder. The address from us will be from fishsitefeedback."
808417,MCTFisher9120,2013-09-18 22:19:00,3761,"I called in many rods again today...some from July, August others from the start September even...no charge warranty replacements happy customers. Warranty has to be looked at more, a cardoor is no longer being accepted. Were at fault so why should Shimano pay. I am not stabbing at you buckhorn but we see it weekly. crushed guides rods broken at the handle, it doesn't happen much. A clean cut blank was not in a bent motion (fishing) so many people fraud the system and why not for years money was wasted thousands of rods were replaced. Even though I only deal with several rejects when you tell the person why the rod is not being warranted it's understood and usually they own up to walking on there pole.  A $20 processing fee to replace a $179.99-$599 Loomis is not much to ask, as far as NRX reel seat problems those are long gone unless guys still have ""the first of the NRXs"" that are only failing now.  The new Wildcard Program on the GL2, GLX and NRX Lineup is unreal, register your rod through filling out a forum and you have a 1 time no questions asked replacement regarless if a fish breaks it or you did. That's a + in my eyes.  Glad Bantam got back to you regarding the rods, didn't know that looks like more calls to make come a few weeks!"
808418,MCTFisher9120,2013-09-18 22:25:00,3761,"  I haven't had older model rods replaced with the same lineups. A ""old"" Compre, Crucial, or Cumara will be replaced with a new current rod. Your 7' will now be a 7'2 your 6'6 will be a 6'8 and so on.  Glad to hear you got looked after."
807459,buckhorn250,2013-09-12 12:55:00,85,"I'll start by saying that I have been a loyalty Shimano customer for years have have over 50 rod and reel combos (nobody tell my wife). Over the years I have been vocal at the amazing service I have received and have posted such messages on OFC.  But something has happened. Over the winter I purchased a new Cumara rod and in the day of bass opener the rod snapped on a cast ( at the handle). I dropped it off at Shimano in Peterborough and they said it definitely looked like a flawed blank..but that the rod had to go in for review to see if it qualified for replacement...not the greatest experience compared to the past but tolerable. 3 weeks later I was shipped a replacement rod...a Crucial. They downgraded the replacement for some reason and I called in. 'No problem just ship the Curcial back and we'll send you out a Cumara'...which I did. Then I was told the Cumara was back ordered until mid August...late August comes..no rod. I call in, now its backordered until end of October. So I buy a top of the line rod and miss out on the entire season.  This type of frustration with Shimano was a new experience for me, in the past it has been all surprise and delight. I submit a complaint through their website, no response, I submit an escalation complaint...that was 5 weeks ago. Still no response.  I hope that Shimano monitors OFC for related topics (if not, they should this is a wealth of customer feedback for any manufacture) So my question is simple  Shimano, what happened to your customer service !!?? If this is a strategic change in direction, its the wrong one. Focus group of one, but I'm looking for 3 new combos, in the past there would be no decision other then which Shimano product to buy...not so any more. Sad day.  thanks for allowing a forum for me to rank  A former loyal Shimano customer"

807465,BillM,2013-09-12 13:07:00,17367,Pick up the phone and talk to someone.  Relying on email is like relying on a letter put in the mail.
807466,musky_hunter,2013-09-12 13:08:00,328,"Sucks, your dealer couldn't help you?  G. Loomis is even worse now..."
807469,buckhorn250,2013-09-12 13:19:00,85,Sorry...forgot the mention the numerous phone calls I have also had.

807478,jimmer,2013-09-12 14:02:00,2730,Sad. Some companies lose sight of what got them their good reputation amd a successful business.
807479,wkimwes,2013-09-12 14:02:00,76,"I would be raising more hell right now.  That Bull what they did personally and I'm a loyal Shimano/G Loomis fan too.  Thankfully over the 20 years I've owned a Shimano product I never broke a rod..*knock on wood* so I haven't tested their warranty ever, why I am fan because they are just reliable.  I hope I don't have to go through this.  By the way, if you frequent the TT boards, you could always post there in the Shimano Support Forum - Bantam1 is the Shimano Rep there and is top notch at assisting people.  Maybe try him?  (I actually have a V Rod that has a minor issue with the reel locking, he said I could get it replaced since it's a defect after years of having it.  I didn't replace it because it has sentimental value, it was a rod I first used when I started bass fishing hardcore.  I'll probably just get it fixed locally because I don't want to replace it with a new rod.)"
807485,musky_hunter,2013-09-12 14:25:00,328,he'll just tell you to call the canadian office.....been there done that.
807535,curryale,2013-09-12 17:23:00,26,I took a G-Loomis Rod in to a local shop in January.  I am still waiting for a replacement as of today.  According to the shop the rod has now been backordered for 9 months.
807546,wkimwes,2013-09-12 18:05:00,76,"Weird, he gave me all of the information via PM regarding my issue and provided me the paperwork too."
807555,MCTFisher9120,2013-09-12 19:44:00,3761,"I should hold back a little here as Shimano takes care of more customers rods and reels than anybody else, but you have made some good points. I see dozens of rods yearly turn around quickly and not very quickly and a lot of hit has to do with new lineup's of rods and backordered products. The US gets many rods before us north of the border and a backordered replacement is quite common. Ugly Stick travel rods were backordered for 4 months from Pure Fishing so customers waited months for those...just a example.  When I send out rods Shimano gets them within 3 days and what is in stock and around them in Peterborough get's sent right away. If they told you the rod would be back late August then you should of got it then or at thee worst early September. What model did you break? I've seen some Worm & Jig replacements come back as well as several in the ""Spinnerbait"" lineup in under 4 weeks time. I love Shimano still because they always seem to offer a no charge warranty and they do a immense about of contributions in our fishing industry.  Hope you see your new rod soon. I'm still waiting 2 month's for my uncles Pflueger Spinning reel, and on week 13 on a friends Fenwick so your not the only one. Chris Giles is a pleasure to deal with at Shimano in Peterborough (Warranty/Repair) if you can find his contact speak with him over the phone. Timing is not Shimano's fault or yours...you could of broke it earlier in the year and had it by now...It's just bad timing man I called and knew ahed my 6'10MH Cumara Spinnerbait rod was backordered after it broke so I ordered a Looimis so I wouldn't miss out (guide rapped too tight instant snap opening week just like you).  Regardless don't hate too much, Shimano is very good but I wish they stocked more rods for warranty."
807557,buckhorn250,2013-09-12 19:59:00,85,"Thanks Mike...it is a worm and Jig rod...the 6-6.  Like I said, I have been a huge fan of Shimano. I work in the Customer Experience and Loyalty industry and I have used them as an example of a company that get customer experience. Writing this post was really tough for me. But I did some searching and it looks like this is not an isolated incident and that something has changed.  It sad to see a company that really got CE fall so far so fast."
807584,Richie Razor,2013-09-12 22:40:00,536,"In my experiences with rod breakages (few and far between) the retailer would simply exchange out of stock. This is the kind of service you get when shopping at bps, sail, lebarons and JB's in my experience."
807587,Angler management,2013-09-12 22:50:00,280," Sail replaced my snapped Abu Villain over the counter and it was 2 months after the purchase with no receipt.... Gagnons also was willing to replace a snapped carrotstix e21, but didnt have the model i wanted. Offered me any other rod, or wait 3 weeks for replacement. I waited the three weeks and they sent me a spinning rod by mistake, so he gave me money back and i bought a worm/jig Cumara instead. He phoned me a couple weeks later and told me they finally received the right rod, and i took that as well. Lol"
807593,Whitespinnerbait,2013-09-12 23:21:00,2038,Their out of stock !!...what do you want them to do ??  BTW...50 RODS AND REELS !!!
807609,landry,2013-09-13 02:15:00,1005,He wants them to at least engage in a discussion and call him back. Maybe offer him some kind of option. Is that too much to ask spinnerbait?
807611,glen,2013-09-13 02:28:00,2641,Waiting for two months is nuts.   If you brake a bass rod they take so long you might as well get an ice rod.
807633,buckhorn250,2013-09-13 10:31:00,85,"Thanks Landry...that's exactly it. Customer loyalty (and mine with Shimano) is often built when something goes wrong, The manner in which a manufacture treat you during issues is critical. I had 2 warranty experiences with Shimano bad guides on 2 rods...exchanged the rods no questions asked and actually upgraded me, and I broke the handle on one of my Curados...went to get a paid repair and the refused to take my money...kept saying "" it should not have broke"". These happened several years ago and based on these types of experiences, why would I buy anything else. But like I keep saying...something has changed.I kept reading that they were clawing back on their warranty process but didn't want to believe it. Thanks again for all the feedback  C"
807643,buick14,2013-09-13 12:21:00,741,Warranty and quality went downhill? No I dont beleive it.  Thats crazy talk.  Ive had problems in the past but they sorted it out.  One took me 5 months...then they shipped wrong rod. I hope they getback to you its annoying...they better get their act together......especially loomis related !
807661,mattybculp,2013-09-13 14:47:00,388,"Never had a problem yet with shimano. I have broken 3 crucials over the years. Drove 10 mins to the warehouse here and Peterborough, never asked for a receipt or warranty paper. Just my address and every time within 3 weeks a new crucial was at my door. Sure they were foam handles instead of the cork ones which the broken ones were, but I remember saying damn that aint shabby broken rod after 3 years of use and I get a new one, ok I will keep buying shimano. Now maybe that's because they weren't high end rods like cumaras but its too bad everybody hasn't had the good luck ive had with the customer service. Perhaps my lucks gunna run out."
807670,DRIFTER_016,2013-09-13 16:42:00,10439, G Loomis is owned by Shimano so why should that surprise you? :-/
807671,davis,2013-09-13 16:48:00,128,"if you're not already, sign yourself up on Facebook and post your grievance on their page (facebook.com/fishshimano). guaranteed you'll get a response and a speedy resolution."
807687,Steve,2013-09-13 19:58:00,2075,shimano's customer service has fallen off the cliff and is spiraling out of control.  i had a broken crankbait rod that took 10 months to replace the rod.  i had four nrx reel seats fail (glue issue).  i had shimano 4000 ci4 drags fail on the FIRST king salmon hooked.  the list will go on and on.  unfortunately no other manufacturer has picked up the slack when comparing to high end equipment.
