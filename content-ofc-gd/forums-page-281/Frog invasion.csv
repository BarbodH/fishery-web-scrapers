807791,lew,2013-09-14 19:14:00,12766,The last couple weeks I've seen more frogs than I have in years.  I just finished cutting all my grass and must have seen 40 of them jumping outta the way. I've talked to other guys on the road and everyone is seeing the same thing this year.  I guess it's a good thing as I remember reading a couple years ago where frogs were on the decline all over the world and nobody seemed to know why.  Anybody else seeing a HUGE increase in them ??
807792,big guy,2013-09-14 19:55:00,414,"Yes, lots of them in the grass here as well and cheap entertainment for the dog."
807793,Roy,2013-09-14 19:56:00,13728,"Yup, since the middle of July, thousands of them in the yard, toads though, not frogs. I've never seen that many in one small area. I've been having trouble cutting the lawn."
807795,Rich,2013-09-14 20:05:00,3927,"Have definitely been seeing a lot on my nightly pond walks.. bullfrogs too, like wow i cant hear myself think in the evening over those guys! Haha"
807796,Andy,2013-09-14 20:08:00,330,I think it must have been the wet start to the summer year. I've also seen a lot more of those prickly wild cucumber vines on trees everywhere I go. And a friend up north says that he's seen more snakes than in the past years as well.
807797,mattyk,2013-09-14 20:14:00,2110,I've heard that when there is a lot of amphibians around its a good thing and is a sign of a healthy environment. They are the first to disappear with high pollution levels.
807800,aplumma,2013-09-14 20:54:00,6896,I have a few toads down my way as well. They live under the front porch and feast when the outside light is on.   Art
807802,lew,2013-09-14 20:57:00,12766," That's the part I find strange actually, the fact that I HAVEN'T seen a snake around here all  summer when they could be having a feast with all these frogs.  I've got some toads around here as well but their all in the vegetable garden...guess they must like tomatoes"
807813,dhickey,2013-09-15 01:27:00,1038,Frogs and toads are a good thing. Leave them alone and they bounce back in droves.
807815,Rod Caster,2013-09-15 01:41:00,5784,Lots of snakes up here! Frog levels seem about normal but it's only my first year on my property.
807828,OhioFisherman,2013-09-15 05:14:00,6623,"It was a good year for them here too, a decent spring with enough rain so the breeding areas didn't dry up with the tadpoles still swimming in them.  As a kid I remember a small shallow pool in a field next to my uncle's home in the country. It wasn't more than a foot deep but held water in the spring as long as there was a decent amount of rain.  It was always full of tadpoles and newts in the spring, in dry years full of tadpole and newt spots in the dry ground by June."
807843,bigugli,2013-09-15 12:50:00,6138,Cool wet summers always bring an increase. A lot of ponds are often dried out before the tadpoles can fully develop. That wasn't a problem this year.
807851,Richie Razor,2013-09-15 13:36:00,536,"Does anyone here catch frogs to eat? I would say then, it's probably been a bumper year!!"
807915,sofabed,2013-09-16 01:20:00,119,I am in the Kitchener area and lots of frogs and snakes this year. It's been a few years since I have had to pull dead frogs out of it but this year it was a regular occurrence. Frogs not snakes
807916,manitoubass2,2013-09-16 01:29:00,11391,Insane amounts here this year and about a month or two late. Hard to now the lawn but the kids sure don't mind catch and releasing them:)  I'm expecting a lot of big pike and bass here this fall
807951,Headhunter,2013-09-16 13:33:00,5703,Frog migration = Pickereye in the shallows at night... oh my! HH
807967,fishindevil,2013-09-16 17:22:00,6254,shhhhhhhhh...... nobody knows that joe....
807991,jimmer,2013-09-16 19:38:00,2730,"It's great to see. My wife keeps commenting on how many frogs there are. Also, saw some snakes for the first time in years."
808131,bucktail,2013-09-17 11:57:00,1857,"Lots of tree frogs this year thats for sure, even in the city!"
