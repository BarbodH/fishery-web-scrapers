PS.~~I am also trying to sell some land in Florida, lots of area at low tide"
808217,Big Cliff,2013-09-17 20:30:00,6899,"Well, if you tell me what spots you have already claimed I'll tell you which ones were mine. BTW, that land in Florida, I'll send you a bank draft if you promise to take out the cost of the land and send me the balance by wire transfer."
808318,Nipfisher,2013-09-18 12:46:00,2449,I have the perfect lure for you to use there. It will cost you $1000 but it is worth every penny because it is guaranteed to catch lots of big fish! PM me for info and payment options.
