384763,mpagnan,2009-09-19 01:41:00,84,Wading question. If I enter Whiteman's Creek from the Pottruff bridge can I make my way downstream to the Grand if I stay in the water and not have to worry about trespassing?

384851,danbouck,2009-09-19 12:40:00,4380,I believe there are trees blocking the water and they don't like trespassers
