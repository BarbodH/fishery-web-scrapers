384615,TJQ,2009-09-18 19:17:00,7806,"This is my dillema... Right now at the camp, in the sauna, I have shower setup.  It is comprised of a small 12v bilge pump hooked up to a 12V car battery.  I have an on/off switch inline and the bilge pump goes in the bucket of warm water.  Of course it runs off a 12v battery, which I trickle charge of the generator during the day.  Well the 12V battery is toast, and I'm exploring options as to how to power the 12V bilge pump directly from the genny/plug, rather than a battery.  I have tried using some 120V to 12V transformers, from the myriad of electronics equipment I've had over the years but the output amperage isn't enough to power the pump.  Any suggestions??   I'm at a loss.. and I'd rather not buy another battery that I have to haul in and out of there every year."
384616,Muskieman,2009-09-18 19:20:00,2472,Use a cheap battery charger .. That's what I do  works great....   RFS    by the way I caught 6 this morning  kept 4 and was back home at 10:20.
384620,Terry,2009-09-18 19:35:00,14456,many battery chargers will not work without a battery attached ...  but there are small 120v pumps around you can buy  this should do the job $10.00  http://www.homedepot.ca/webapp/wcs/stores/...tk=P_PartNumber  might need 2 to get enough pressure
384621,TJQ,2009-09-18 19:42:00,7806,Thanks!! I will explore both options!!  I hadn't thought about a fountain pump!!!
384624,scugpg,2009-09-18 19:52:00,1373,CTEK makes a charger that has a 7A supply mode designed to do this.
384629,TJQ,2009-09-18 20:02:00,7806,Looks like CT carries CTEK as well!
384632,Jonny,2009-09-18 20:13:00,1380,I have a somewhat related question.  What I want is a charger that will power a 12V winch from 120V current. The winch will take up to 90 Amps.  Any recommendations?
384640,Terry,2009-09-18 20:52:00,14456,"again many chargers will not work without a battery hooked to it, so things will not run off them but if you also run  it off a battery, get a charger that has booster charge  http://www.canadiantire.ca/AST/browse/4/Au...ine%2BStart.jsp"
384643,Jonny,2009-09-18 20:56:00,1380," Yes, that looks like the kind of thing I need!  So you're saying that in bewtween the charger and the winch there would still have to be a 12V battery?"
384646,Terry,2009-09-18 21:01:00,14456,yes they do it could be a really small one but you do need one
384661,Ksword,2009-09-18 21:38:00,40,"TJ - I betcha a battery charger will be cheaper than a fountain pump.  Just make sure that you get a manual charger - that way it should work without a battery.  Besides, this way you will have a charger in case you leave the lights on your 4 wheeler!"
384663,danbouck,2009-09-18 21:42:00,4380,How many amps does it use?
384670,aplumma,2009-09-18 21:51:00,6896,pump idea T.J. here you go....The reason that your pump will not work is the amp draw is to high. Look at this link it is for a low amp draw even a solar application. I would ask the service rep to make sure but I see no reason why it will not fit the bill.  The Southern Contingency
384673,tjsa,2009-09-18 22:03:00,1578,"How about a pc power supply? There are 750 watt and higher versions. Only problem is trying to figure out which wires are the On/Off switch, they usually just plug into the motherboard, and the switch on the front of the pc also plugs into the motherboard. Then, you have regulated 12V and 5V DC power, with extra connections available."
384683,Terry,2009-09-18 22:29:00,14456,I think that watts is on the 120v ac side and would be somewhere around 6.2 amps
384703,Jonny,2009-09-18 23:25:00,1380," OK, thanks Terry.  Now I know what to look for in time for the 2010 season.  ---  I wonder how we're going to pronounce that ---  ""Two thousand ten"" or ""Twenty-ten""?"

384767,Jonny,2009-09-19 01:53:00,1380,Good info on inverters. I wanted to avoid those because they're so damned expensive!
