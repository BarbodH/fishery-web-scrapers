384925,LucG,2009-09-19 20:02:00,779,"I found a deal this weekend and just wanted to run past a few of yous. I pretty much have allready made up my mind, but just havent handed over the cash yet.  Package includes:  12 ft alluminium in very good condition, but has a slow leak 6 hp Evinrude w/ hose and tank (not sure of year, but its an older one) Crappy trailer, Need to add lights and it'll do the job just fine.  I tested the whole package and it was great, besides the slow leak.  Not anything I would want to take out on any big lakes, but it beats my canoe.  All for $500  Should I be jumping on this deal?"
384926,Greencoachdog,2009-09-19 20:14:00,8163,Have you been shopping long?... does it look like a good deal compared to others?  It doesn't sound like too bad of a deal to me.
384954,Beans,2009-09-19 21:27:00,3339,"I originally paid $250 for a 14 ft aluminum boat and trailer (the Tin of Beans) but by the time the Kawartha Lakes Old Farts Commitee (Renovation Division) (Big Cliff and Nanook) got finished tearing out the seats and transom, removing the trailer hubs and wheels, they handed me a shopping list for a sheet of plywood, new hubs and wheels c|w tires, a wiring harness for the lights it ended up costing me $500...  You notice I don't mention a motor...My bro-in-law had one sitting in his basement that he was storing for another bro-in-law(4.5 hp Mercury...no remote tank) so we agreed to go partners...  So, in my opinion, you're getting a good deal For $500  BTW...have used it 7 summers now and still haven't stopped the leak...I fashioned a portable bilge pump and got a big bailing plastic bottle so it is good to go !!!"

384974,smally21,2009-09-19 22:08:00,993,i burn 500 in fuel   every month!!!
384976,misfish,2009-09-19 22:16:00,29133,"Grab it. 500 bills? Thats a deal,even if you got to put a couple hundred into it."
