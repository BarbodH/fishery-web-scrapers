384945,Slayingm,2009-09-19 21:06:00,204,The north winds and dropping temps the past couple of days have definately played a roll in the action being somewhat slower then the previous week but making some adjustements and slowing down still brings the fish into the boat.  I had folks out on Simcoe and Couchiching on Thursday and Friday and we caught a number of fish in the 2-6lb class on tubes and drop-shot rigs in deeper water on hard bottom areas off of deep weedlines.  The fish in the shallows just seemed to shut off on us so fishing deeper was the key for smallies as was dunking tubes and jigs in the deep weedlines for buckets.  My guests were from Louisiana on Friday and had a great time on the water.        Simcoe was really rock'n with the North wind yesterday so the N. end of the lake was the place to be.  The new Rapala 'MaxRap' new for 2010 did the trick on a couple of nice Simcoe smallies... the key was working the bait with longer pauses during the agressive jerks as the fish were not as agressive.          Remember that when conditions get tough and the fish are in somewhat of a negative mood often slowing down you presentations is the key to getting bit.    Take care and be safe out there..... Greg.
