( Thanks again Dude! )  We were finally able to round up all the pledges and Ginny did the draw a few days ago.  You've won a Coffee machine, and 2lbs of Coffee.  Once I sort out picking it up from Tinbanger we'll have to figure out an excuse to hit the water so you can get your prize!  Who say's giving to a good cause doesn't pay off?  Cheers, Ryan"

Got on the computer cause I couldn't remember entering an contest, lol.  Thanks Ryan and thanks Tinbanger for your donation.  It was all for a good cause Ryan and good on ya for doing what you did.  It's quite amazing what can happen when you get a group from the board together, some great people around here.   Looks like we may finally get that day on the water Ryan!"
