383601,Rob,2009-09-16 00:03:00,467,"Just wondering if you have them and if you like them, cause for 120 bucks it better be worth it!  Rob"
383604,Terry,2009-09-16 00:09:00,14456,dang didn't know they had them do they have a list of lakes..I will have to check into this edit: yes they do http://www8.garmin.com/cartography/inland/...sts/Ontario.pdf
383622,Jack-of-all-fish,2009-09-16 00:50:00,53,Wow thats an impressive list of lakes. Anybody know how much detail is included. I own the Navionics Canadian Lake Platinum card for my HDS-7 and it has no where near that many Ontario lakes on it. It cost me $230.
384563,sully,2009-09-18 16:05:00,40,Are these Hydro maps of the lakes? or just a regular map?  Sully
384564,Terry,2009-09-18 16:08:00,14456,you have to look at the list  the ones with * only show outline/shoreline of the lake
384589,Jds63,2009-09-18 17:26:00,1365,"here is a link to some sample images of the depth contours  I have the Garmin GPSMAP 60cx, use it a lot for canoeing , hiking and marking fishing spots this software looks like it will really be helpful, at least if i'm not catching anything my gps will keep me entertained ...LOL   https://buy.garmin.com/shop/shop.do?pID=37821#imageTab"
384597,DMASTER,2009-09-18 18:00:00,4,"OK, but a lot of people in reviews are saying that depth information and reefs data are missing for major lakes like Lake Simcoe, Lake of Woods, Musoka lakes, etc., many lakes counted What's up? I saw at least Lake Simcoe data available on GARMIN BlueCharts... May be something wrong?  Who ACTUALLY have it and can share his opinion?"
384614,canadadude,2009-09-18 19:11:00,769,"seems like lots of kawartha lakes do not have the depth available, in fact most southern Ontario lakes I fish are just shoreline maps"
