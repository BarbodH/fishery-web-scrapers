384824,Twocoda,2009-09-19 04:08:00,4130,never ever ever have i ever been sea sick ...until....the steelback brewery dude got a hold of me for the night (complimentary drinks at every bar we went to )...next mornin on the water ....lets just say there were a few pickled fish that were caught ..    Syn ...now thats funny stuff
385066,The Urban Fisherman,2009-09-20 02:10:00,2050," thanks dawg... so deep fried fish and bud light limes the night before wasn't a good idea? I was find until I went into the cabin and tried to write a few things down... hit me like a ton of bricks...   haha that story reminds me of a scene from ""Stand By Me"".  This chubby kid slams a micky of booze then enters a pie eating contest...you can guess the rest from there..   Thanks for the ginger tip..never heard that one before...   The coke/Pepsi thing worked, but not so much for the pop content, more so the carbonation.. you feel better when you burp..   It's going to be a good one dude!   yeah dude..the diesel smell gets to you for sure if you're down wind... nevermind the smell of Rabies Baits?!? lol   Thanks man... Ritchie (the other camera op.) made it through the whole trip without a problem... he even shot some stuff from the fly bridge on our way back!!"
385067,The Urban Fisherman,2009-09-20 02:10:00,2050," lol dude I'd love to see you driving a boat, or sailing with goggles and a snorkel on!  Some funny stories there John..thanks alot for taking the time!   lol usually once you get into a fish or two and the blood starts pumpin' you're a-ok   So no morning coffee? I don't know if I can do that.. especially on a ""work day"". lol   lol funny picture Syn.  I got it right away!  I'm a little out of touch with that sort of stuff compared to some of my friends but still young enough to have kept myself in the loop a little!   lol yeah man - Snag styles...  Thanks for comin' out today dude!  Nice to finally put a face to the blurrs and swirls! hahaha jk  cheers, Ryan"
385074,snag,2009-09-20 02:31:00,1932,"Good to see you too.  Thank you for the swag gift for my son. (he wouldn't take the hat off all day/night!)  Please thank Dave and the rest of your crew for their generosity. Thanks to you and your sponsors, we enjoyed our day at Ontario Place for free.  What a great way to extend the summer!  You've busted your butt for your career and home.  I look forward to an outing with you.  Thanks again,  Grant"
385171,fishnsled,2009-09-20 15:01:00,3520,"Been there done that.    I think it is even worst when you have to look through a viewfinder all day.  Happened twice to me when I use to shoot the fishing show.  Gulf of Mexico fishing the wrecks and Lake Huron for salmon.  GCD has some good advise there.  One thing that I've found that helps me are the Seaband bracelets, you can find them at you local drug store.  Another thing that my girlfriend's sister and brother-in-law use is a patch, similar to a smokers patch.  They've sailed from Vancouver to Austrailia and have experienced some nasty weather.  One storm they were in had 9 metre waves throwing them around.  Not much you can do to prevent sea sickness when you are being tossed around in that but only one of them got sick.  Nothing like being on dry ground once you get back now is there?"
384658,The Urban Fisherman,2009-09-18 21:30:00,2050,"Hey guys,  Anybody have any tricks to avoid getting sea sick?  I don't post stuff from Dave's website often because there's to many haters out there that will accuse me of ""spamming"" but this is a good one...  We recently went on a shoot out to the east coast and I got sea sick to the point where I was face down a bucket.  I was good to go until the 40 mile run back to shore...  Oops, apparently ""dynamic Pages in  Tags aren't allowed so you can see the pix here:  http://www.factsoffishing.com/photoblog.php?id=138  Have a good one! - and by that I don't mean a good laugh at my expense....  Cheers, Ryan"
384659,danbouck,2009-09-18 21:34:00,4380, Sorry   :lol:
384667,muskymatt,2009-09-18 21:48:00,2608,Happens to the best of them Ryan. Could have been worse..it could have happened in a canoe on flat water fishing for perch!!  Looked like a great trip and at least you made it till the way back...great pics.  Matt
384668,Greencoachdog,2009-09-18 21:50:00,8163,"Sorry Ryan, but I got a good laugh out of just reading the title before I even opened the thread!  I've never been sea sick but have seen many people that did get it!  My best tips are to stay out of the cabin and in the fresh air... watch the calm horizon and think about the fuzzy bunny!... if you're going to take sea sickness meds, start taking them the night before!... limit your intake of alcohol (none is best) and avoid greasy food.... if you do eat food make sure it's seafood so as to make a good chum when you hurl over the side!!!"
384669,Billy Bob,2009-09-18 21:50:00,5865,"No I have never gotten sea sick............but once we went on a stupid whale watch out of Boston, Ma and it was HOT and SUNNY........the boat had a air conditioned LARGE cabin but that looked like sick bay because it was filled with Asian people who puking....so I finally found some shade just outside the cabin door where the roof extended........I was sitting there for only a few minutes when this nice looking Asian man started to walk up to me.....I thought he wanted to chat.......but then he bent over and puked in the garbage can next to me.......I went back to the stern of the boat and baked in the sun for the 4 hour tour......it was only suppose to be 3 hours but they couldn't find any whales so we stayed out a extra hour.........they gave us tickets for another trip that are good anytime........that I find hard to believe because the first time was good......LOL"
384677,danjang,2009-09-18 22:07:00,148,"Stay in the middle of the boat, look out into the horizon, take dramamine (I was on a plane in a thunderstorm with the flu and did not yak once), chew ginger anything or plug one ear with your finger. These usually work for me."
384679,Syn,2009-09-18 22:18:00,519,lol Dave's face in the last pic.  http://www.goddesscruise.com/SeaSick.htm  Natural remedies: Eating peppermint in conjunction with ginger and drinking coke/pepsi for some people.
384680,MCTFisher9120,2009-09-18 22:21:00,3761,"That sucks man, can't wait to see the show!"
384697,kickingfrog,2009-09-18 23:08:00,8333,"Yep.  My lesson:  Don't combine lots of Mexican food from the resort, with lots of free beer on the bus ride to the deep sea charter and then proceed to sit in the cat bird seat sucking in diesel fumes in 12 foot swells.   Second lesson:  Working in the back of a low flying twin otter in horrible turbulence, dropping rabies baits that stink like nasty chicken. Fifteen odd years later and sometimes I still can't eat chicken soup."
384700,kickingfrog,2009-09-18 23:14:00,8333,"Quote from the web site:  ""I have to give it to Ryan he held it together all day while we were shooting and never complained. I guess when the show was done and we started heading back it became a little too much.""  Sounds like Ryan is a real pro.  Using a camera is not the way I would want to spend my time on a boat."
384707,JohnF,2009-09-18 23:37:00,3494,"Dawg's got it right. Stay abovedecks and keep an eye on the horizon. I always laffed at the pukers on the dive boats (and the ones who had to yak into their regs underwater).  Back in my young and foolish days we often sailed in weather that should have scared us - but it was always in open boats (we weren't rich) so I had no idea about the consequences of losing sight of the part of the world that was forever flat. Then one day I went sailing on a rich guy's boat, with a cabin & a head. I made the mistake of going below decks to get a camera and the Mal de Mer hit me in spades, like a great stinky truck. - INSTANT PUKERY!!!  From that day ever after I stayed above decks on the lakes and the oceans and never again suffered the joys of feeding the fish. Even when those around me were tossing their cookies left, right and centre, my own tummy stayed the course, and you don't know puking till you've spent a few hours with 5 other divers on a small boat in 10-12 foot waves. I'm so committed to keeping the horizon in sight that I've been known to ride out nasty water by wearing my mask and snorkle on board so I can breathe while being washed by the waves and spindrift - and sitting out where I can see the shoreline.  But really, I think the Great Lakes are worse than the ocean for puke inducement. Those choppy short wave lengths are murder. The ocean gives you big fat rollers that let yer tummy get tuned in. On the Lakes yer belly's goin' up as the boat's goin' down, and that means yer lunch is goin' north faster than yer esophagus goes south - baaaaad juju.  And there's no shame to getting seasick. Experienced divers take it in stride. I've seen grown men hold up a finger and say ""Excuse me."" in the middle of a sentence - turn and hang their head outboard letting forth with a mighty YYYAAAKKK!!!, wipe their lips and return to the topic with nary a blink. One guy I remember from Mexico was even trying to talk around the massive outletting to let us all know there was a sea turtle riding the waves beside the boat. Unfortunately for the turtle he blew chunks all over it, but it didn't seem bothered by the lunch shower.  So as far as I'm concerned, when it comes to seasickness, real men just let 'er fly - and damn the consequences. It's only food, after all. Divers call it chumming, but what do they really know about fishing?  JF"

384711,JohnF,2009-09-18 23:42:00,3494," A real man would have worn a turtle neck, pulled it up over his lips when the intestinal unrest started and kept on filming. Clothes can be washed but great images missed are gone forever.  JF"
384719,BUSTER,2009-09-18 23:57:00,1336,"havent got sea sick yet, and by the look on your face i dont think i want to!"
384729,Bly,2009-09-19 00:23:00,1556,"I feel for you Ryan......recently experienced a bit of that myself.....was lucky though and kept my stomach contents in my stomach.    Looks like most things that I know of have been mentioned already but here is one or two just in case...  avoid caffeine the day of pretzels and ginger ale on the boat....small bites sips be well rested and hydrated before hand banana a few hours before  keeping your eye on the horizon is key, unless you are out at night..pray for lots of boats in the area lol"
384734,Greencoachdog,2009-09-19 00:36:00,8163,"  Hahaha!!!... sorry bly but I can't help it!!!  I've heard that being in a boat in the fog is the worst!... you know you're moving (trolling) but it doesn't look like it!... bleeeeeah!!!... Raaaaaalph, Eaaaaaaaarl.. where'd you park the Buuuuuuuuuick???"

384741,Syn,2009-09-19 00:53:00,519,Kayne meme going around. I wonder if some of you will get it.
384743,Jonny,2009-09-19 00:55:00,1380,Ginger capsules from the Vitamin section of your pharmacy.  Take a couple two hours before you go out.  If I was really prone to the heaves I'd follow all the other advice as well.

384766,Cudz,2009-09-19 01:51:00,2652,Ryan that is funny.  I have never been sea sick and Ihave been in some serious swells in the sea but I am sure my day will come.
