I think that Heinz knows this was a mistake and that could be why everywhere you go that huge problem bottle is on sale for $2.99."
384213,johnnyb,2009-09-17 14:40:00,3413,"Totally hear ya, Randy!  The ketchup bottle I move back and forth so that when it finally comes out, it doesn't hit in one spot....but I can't figure the relish thing out...will try shaking it like someone suggested. But I don't buy those bottles...only use them when I'm forced to, at classy occasions"
384332,JohnF,2009-09-17 20:32:00,3494,"Ketchup is for eggs, and only tastes right when the bottom of the bottle has been slapped by hand.  More importantly, green relish does not belong in a squeeze container. It comes out like a cow voiding it's bladder with enuf relish for any 3 hamburgers and the noise it makes should be accompanied by a disgusting smell. I just can't get past that imagery with my hamburgers. I bought one and one only of those squirt bottles. Never again will they darken the door of my fridge.  Squirt bottles are for yellow mustard only.  JF"

384370,Handlebarz,2009-09-17 22:30:00,3790,I fail to understand the problem here you are saying to much ketchup I never heard of such a thing I thought that was just a dash of goodness whe nit went everywhere then again we buy the stuff by the cases yep two or more at a time that way I dont run out.
384372,splashhopper,2009-09-17 22:33:00,2931,  man... u got problems!!   lol
384442,Cudz,2009-09-18 02:20:00,2652,All I am going to say is this: 
384451,sturgman,2009-09-18 02:45:00,249,Hp sauce and Franks Red hot sauce in my fridge.. What is this Ketchup stuff?
384476,ohhenrygsr,2009-09-18 05:02:00,947,does anyone like any other brands of ketchup?
384506,Fish4Eyes,2009-09-18 12:09:00,1022,I hear ya on the relish. You have to give it a real good shake and then squeeze it out. I find it comes out in big clumps though. Smaller ketchup containers you dont have to squeeze as hard.
384507,Fish4Eyes,2009-09-18 12:11:00,1022," compliments ketchup sold at sobeys is my favourite, half the price too."
384511,JohnF,2009-09-18 12:34:00,3494, You put those on food - or catfish bait?  JF
384531,ssminnow,2009-09-18 13:52:00,48,"It's a sad state of affairs when you have to take your ketchup bottle out to the garage for modifications before use.  Don't get me started on the way some kids toys are fastened to the packaging,  or the fact that my coffee pot spills half the coffee until you have poured the first couple cups."
384556,lhousesoccer,2009-09-18 15:33:00,442,"Yep - same deal here.  You can't lightly squeeze the ketchup bottle for a ""little"" ketchup.  You have to grab it with a vice-like death grip, and squeeze, and when that little valve finally gives way, you get 10 hot dog's worth of ketchup all at once.  I hate it."
384569,blaque,2009-09-18 16:18:00,2419,"This thread is pretty funny, more differences I didnt know existed between us Yanks and you guys from canader lol......even in condament usage  1) i WONT put mustard on a hotdog..........ketchup will do, relish is fine (dill) 2) i WONT put ketchup on eggs, yicckkkkk.......French's mustard is a staple for my scrambled though 3) Chili Dogs arent sold in Canada?????? Texas hots???  Dont you guys have ketchup flavored potato chips too???  What a country    LOL"
384584,gone_fishin,2009-09-18 17:15:00,481,funny that you bring this up now... i was up at Rice this past weekend for 4 days and our group had the exact same discussion... the relish cap... only juice comes out. LOL.  as soon as i saw your topic i knew it was going to be about the relish cap. hahaha
384594,Jonny,2009-09-18 17:52:00,1380," Best hot dogs --- Roasted over an open fire and put in a top-sliced bun with yellow mustard, green relish, maybe some diced onions. You can ""shortcut"" the separate mustard and relish with ""Hot Dog Relish"", a combination of the two.  Ketchup --- only on French fries, home fries (re-fried potatoes and onions) for breakfast, and tourtiere (meat pie).  Never had a chili dog in my life.  What's the attraction in making a drippy mess of your hot dog?  Yes, we have ketchup-flavoured potato chips. They must be popular enough because you can always get 'em."
384622,blaque,2009-09-18 19:43:00,2419, I actually prefer boiler dogs lol (water boiled oscar meyer)  Chili dogs.............the hot dog isnt the only thing thats a drippy mess when your done. Give it about an hour  Ketchup flavored chips.....?? why dont you just dip plain chips in ketchup lol
384623,Jonny,2009-09-18 19:49:00,1380," Yeah, they're OK too. Best kind in Canada --- Schneider's Red Hots.  My wife and I will be down in the States for about a week soon. Maybe I should try to scare up a chili dog somewhere, despite their explosive qualities.  Forgot to mention wieners and beans --- an old standby, and not just for camping. With fresh buttered bread... hits the spot!"
384631,blaque,2009-09-18 20:13:00,2419, Now THERES something we can agree on LOL! GCD may also be able to attest to that by looking at his last report.  My grandfather used to work for Campbell Soup when i was a kid and he brought home cases full of Campbells Beans and Franks...........my favorite childhood lunch. They havent made them in years though??? Dummies
384635,kickingfrog,2009-09-18 20:28:00,8333,Thank goodness heinz has nothing to do with peanut butter.
384639,Jonny,2009-09-18 20:49:00,1380," You can be guaranteed that if there's something you really like and would keep on buying, eventually some corporate ""bright light"" will decide it should be discontinued."
384645,Fishnwire,2009-09-18 21:01:00,983,"Chillidogs are good and available in Canada.  I make them at home with leftover chilli and they are messy, but still really good.  If you have chilli you don't need any other topping or condomint.  The taste of beans and franks together is totally awesome too.  They should come packaged together in the same can."
383970,Muskieman,2009-09-16 22:18:00,2472,"....  I decided to make Hod Dogs on the BBQ for supper tonight. On the condament list is ...Ketchup... Relish ... Mustard ... Onions.  Well...In my house Mustard goes on first  Then the Ketchup... this is where it gets me mad...  I was getting my Daughters HD  ready and there is a Bottle of Heinz Ketchup that says ""Easy Squeeze""  You have to squeeze  so hard on the friggin' thing  that when it comes out it's like a ""Turbo Jet"" the Ketchup came out so fast it almost blew the food off the plate while covering everything in it's path.  #2  Squeeze Relish.... Nothing but juice comes out and the relish stays in the bottle... then try to get a knife in there after !  Whatever happened to good old glass bottles  or the original squeeze bottles?   I just had to tell someone..   RFS    "
383972,danbouck,2009-09-16 22:36:00,4380,lol ya the ketchup is brutal. Never have an issue with the relish though
383975,Dabluz,2009-09-16 22:40:00,701,Another alternative are the small plastic packages that are almost impossible to tear open and then you end up spreading the stuff more on your fingers than on the HD.
383977,misfish,2009-09-16 22:47:00,29133,"I like salsa and corn relish,both are in a JAR. Still."
383979,SRT8 smoker craft,2009-09-16 22:56:00,1107,LOL I love that it P-ed you off so much that you even took a pic ! I won't buy them like that anymore pain in the butt.
383981,Muskieman,2009-09-16 22:57:00,2472,date is off in the pic .....    My  VCR  still flashes   12:00   RFS 
383991,crappieperchhunter,2009-09-16 23:15:00,2582," Yeah I hear you about the ketchup. Been there, done that  I just took my fillet knive and carved that pesky little plastic membrane out of the hole. No more worries. When the bottle is finished I transfer the modified lid to the new bottle. My family think I am crazy   ...but it has restored peace to my world"
383997,Lunker777,2009-09-16 23:33:00,866,hahah we solved the relish problem at an open house a few weeks ago..... We took the lid off and it seemed to come out fine..... just a light squeez and it was good to go !
384014,bucktail,2009-09-17 00:04:00,1857,The relish is the worst....like you said nothing but relish goo on my burger!
384016,dafishman,2009-09-17 00:08:00,11,so true had the same problem with my 6 year old on her burger nothing but ketchup.
384018,chandru,2009-09-17 00:10:00,63,lol awsome topic i think everyone who has used those things can relate to this! awsome idea with the filet knife and cutting out the membrane though... a true master of innovation!  but then isn't pretty much like the regular plastic bottle with the flip top?  but i definately feel the same. good point! we should get someone from heinz to see this topic!
384021,CLofchik,2009-09-17 00:16:00,854, You have to go to the specialty stores and pickup the fancy imported Dijon ketchups...

384029,Muskieman,2009-09-17 00:26:00,2472,"    I just did the same......  I eliminated the ""Turbo""  Now what about the relish???  RFS "
384030,solopaddler,2009-09-17 00:26:00,8605,It takes a gentle touch boys.  Don't squeeze them too roughly!!  Treat your condiments like women and in due time you'll have them mastered.  I've never had a problem with mine.

384046,ohhenrygsr,2009-09-17 00:50:00,947,I like using this bottle when i'm at home.  But hate it when i'm at a restaurant.   What about this    it was weird but i liked it
384058,Toronto_Angler,2009-09-17 01:10:00,698,If you give the relish bottle a good shake before you use it it should eliminate the problem. The ketchup bottle I store upside down so its already at the top and just needs a gentle squeeze
384082,Radnine,2009-09-17 01:45:00,1538,If you knew what was in that stuff you'd be glad that it didn't come out. If you're lucky next time you won't be able to get the wiener package open as well. Jim
384099,Rizzo,2009-09-17 02:36:00,4754,"same problem here. Why the heck did they mess with the old squeeze bottle anywho...someone in product development should lose their job. They took something that worked fine, tried to turn it into a gimmick and now it sucks"
384108,Jonny,2009-09-17 02:58:00,1380,"Good thing Heinz ain't the only game in town!  Some things aren't meant to come out of squeeze bottles --- relish is one of them.  We always buy our relish in glass jars. Bick's.  Mayo is another of those strange things to put in a squeeze bottle. Tried it a couple of times and won't buy them any more. I'm sure they market this because once the bottle is 2/3 empty you can't get anything out of it any more.  We use GT (Giant Tiger) ketchup - can't tell the difference from Heinz. Their squeeze bottles work fine.  Funny story... but true...  In the 60's my Dad got P.O.'ed with Kraft caramels because the cellophane wrapping was so hard to get off. Whatever possessed him to write to Kraft about that I don't know, but he got a rather snarky letter back from them and to this day he has never eaten another Kraft caramel!  Good luck in the Condiment Wars, Randy!"
384122,kickingfrog,2009-09-17 03:42:00,8333,"Mustard is the only condiment allowed on a hotdog, period.  Having said that, I to am tired of companies turning my condiment dispensers into toys. Ever tried mayo in a squeeze bottle?"
384159,bigugli,2009-09-17 12:03:00,6138,"  SACRILEGE!!!!!!  What is a good jumbo without fried onions and saurkraut, and for our Yankee friends, the sacred chilidog.  The only advantage to the squeeze bottle is that you don't have to carry extra cutlery along. Big advantage for the manufacturer is that you have to buy ketchup/mustard more often"
