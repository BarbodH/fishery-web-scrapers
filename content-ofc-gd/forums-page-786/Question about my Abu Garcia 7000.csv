Would it be easy to take apart and fix it myself?  I don't really want to be without this reel with the pending fall musky season upon us!  Thanks!"
384987,muskymike,2009-09-19 23:19:00,772,"Hey Wendel, its probably not broken. there is a small copper or brass piece of metal that fits in the outer housing attached to the plastic button. (the newer reels have plastic, the older models are metal)  I have pictures of it all taken a part, send me a message and i will send them over to you. Its a very easy fix. Most likely it is either bent out of shape or has come off of its holder.  It should take you no more than 20 mins to fix yourself.  Mike"
