384474,GBW,2009-09-18 04:58:00,8460,Hey all.  So today I was out with my father and he told me when the time comes to sell the cottage he is going to give me his Northstar Scorpion 185 bowrider boat.  So now I need to start rolling my change for a new bow mount trolling motor.  The problem is what to get?  The bow is a seat section but I can add a deck to it that can pop out.  The key is that it must pop out so I can take my kids out on the boat either fishing or tubing.  Any thoughts ideas?  Thanks.  Geoff

Ive fished in various boats that have 40-55lb 12V systems and if you plan to venture out in any weeds or winds you'll wish you'd have spent the extra money.  The higher lb thrust motors tend to also have infinte speed control and in Minn Kota, the maximizer system to prolong battery life"
384523,Garnet,2009-09-18 13:25:00,2056,Look at the battery storage area if theirs room for 2 more 13 inch batteries or room for 3. Now how big of water are you fishing. How long of shaft is a concern?  The answer is go big or stay home.  Garnet
384524,scugpg,2009-09-18 13:33:00,1373,I'd get at least a 70lb Minnkota powerdrive or Terrova with the co-pilot remote. Terrova would be my choice if I had my pick its way easier to deploy and a much better pedal.

384634,blaque,2009-09-18 20:24:00,2419,"I was faced with this dilemma a couple few years back.........i built a custom aluminum bracket and bolted on a 65 lb thrust power drive 60"" shaft (i believe) 24 volt system.  Bracket was a project for sure.  I dont have any issues with thrust, but would have maxed it out if i could do it over. The footpedal on this unit is a bit cumbersome.........and the deployment is a sheer pain in the arse. But it doesnt bother me so much that i cant sleep at night.    "
