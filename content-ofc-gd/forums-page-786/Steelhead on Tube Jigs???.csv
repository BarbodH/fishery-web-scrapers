383987,laszlo,2009-09-16 23:11:00,487,So far this year I've caught the following on Tube Jigs in the river I fish:  Longnose Gar Smallmouth Bass Largemouth Bass Rock Bass Walleye Pike  I was wondering if anyone has had success using Tube Jigs for Rainbow Trout (Steelhead)???  I know they'll be running soon now that the fall breeze is in the air and rain is in the near future. They do feed on crayfish and small minnows so it would seem to make sense.  Thanks  Laszlo

383996,niagara jeep,2009-09-16 23:28:00,20,In the Niagara when things slow down we switch to tubes for lakers and pick up Steel here and there......use to be a group from Brantford I met years back that used small one inch to 2 inch tubes under there floats and did well.
383998,solopaddler,2009-09-16 23:33:00,8605,Yes they work. Have been using micro tubes under a float for over 20 years.
384001,Bernie66,2009-09-16 23:38:00,123,"1-2 inch white tube jigs are great in some of the eastern Ontario tribs, especially near the river mouths late fall and early winter.  When everyone is drifting roe and not getting bites, give it a try.  One problem with fishing tubes is finding a small jig head with a strong enough hook to handle those big chromers. Goodluck."
384006,dnb_cbr,2009-09-16 23:51:00,61,"3' watermelon pattern tube.  She hit it like a freight train. Mind you these were caught in July in the mighty Niagara, so weather or not they are ""steelhead"" or rainbows, i really dont know. Like solopaddler, I like to drift micro tubes under a float, they work best tipped with a  waxworm.  "
384009,misfish,2009-09-16 23:57:00,29133," I was amazed when I caught a brown on one. I asked this question along time ago,and yes they work."
384011,Burtess,2009-09-16 23:58:00,901,"I have used 1 to 1.5"" tubes in white and pink for bows under a float with limited success.  They definately have their place in the arsenal, although I prefer marabou bead head jigs myself.  Burt"
384012,laszlo,2009-09-16 23:59:00,487,"Thanks guys. I'm going to give it a shot later in the month and into Oct.  You know when you get your confidence with a certain bait it's hard to switch it up but at the same time, sometimes a change is due.  I will report back soon enough... Until then...dreaming of steelhead"
384015,ironstone74,2009-09-17 00:05:00,201,"Yeah like I said, they've been using for decades"
384079,troutologist,2009-09-17 01:43:00,951,Its weird. Ive caught fish on them in L Ontario tribs and a few other places. Never had a hit on them in Superior tribs. I've given them a good go too in multiple types of conditions.  Then again jigs dont produce for me up north like they have other places.   Heres a question for you guys. Do you rig them with a small tube jig head or just a small hook? Ive caught them both ways with neither really better than the other.
384085,solopaddler,2009-09-17 01:53:00,8605," Hey bud, I've always just rigged them with a jig head. I use them in slow estuary type water only. A tube head allows for a more horizontal minnow-like presentation under the float.  Also, while you will sometimes catch fish on them dead drifting, either a small ripple on the water or occasional twitches of the float help immensly.  Pencil style floats work better for this than round or oblong shaped floats.  If you attempt to twitch a roundish shaped float you'll invariably end up pulling it off whatever seam your drifting.  A pencil style float will ""waggle"" back and forth. You'll still give the jig action with a twitch, but won't pull it off course.  Cheers"
384086,jediangler,2009-09-17 01:53:00,1923,"My buddy Rand the Impaler caught this 38"" musky on a tube jig in Pigeon lake 3 weeks ago.  I'm sure you'll catch a nice steelhead on a tube if you keep at it."
384091,super dave,2009-09-17 02:09:00,323,I have been using micro tubes for about 5 years now.  I don't use a lead head but instead shove a small split shot in the body to make it sit horizontally.  Then just hook it through the back like a live minnow.   Works fine for me.
384137,KelfuN,2009-09-17 05:16:00,246,"yup, they work.. 1.5-2in micro tubes along with a 1/32oz tube jig under a float.."
384138,Bondar,2009-09-17 05:23:00,817,"i use just a bare jig hook fed through the tube , works good"
384152,solopaddler,2009-09-17 11:45:00,8605," When fishing dead slow estuary waters, using an actual jig head allows you to use little to no shot below your float. Used in conjunction with a self cocking (stem is weighted) pencil float it's a deadly way to rig, very finesse, and usually accounts for more fish."
384301,Harrison,2009-09-17 17:47:00,2202," Agreed 100%!  90 degree eye is ideal.  Deadly off piers in Jan/Feb.  I internally weight them and use a ""custom"" slip float setup.  Turned onto it over 20yrs ago while fishing along side the Hartman bros.  Man, those were the days at the ganny."
384320,trapshooter,2009-09-17 19:20:00,1234,I don't see why not... every other fish eats them!
384365,CLofchik,2009-09-17 22:21:00,854,"I've seen bows hit bottle caps in the rivers, I don't see why tubes wouldn't work if you catch them in the right mood.  They're not exactly the toughest fish to get a hit from."
384443,camillj,2009-09-18 02:23:00,1988,Heh .. I dropped a tee into the Humber today (by mistake) as I was looking into it from a bridge on a golf course ... and was surprised to see about eight fish attack it ... two were small trout ... so I am thinking ... small white tubes may work as well on the tribs as they do on the ice ...
384472,OhioFisherman,2009-09-18 04:43:00,6623,A tube will catch anything that will eat a baitfish or crawfish. Around river mouths where baitfish are schooling in the fall try white with silver glitter or watermelon blue glitter to imitate emerald shiners.
384497,River Rat,2009-09-18 11:25:00,161,"  Same scenario, if the wind is low and you can get away with only a jig head in the tube and a regular stemmed float (no weight) you will detect the ""riser"" hits.....when everyone else is running 6ft weighted leads, I run a 2.5 ft lead bare to the jig head........when the float moves up, or down, any movment...he's there. This is a cold water technique mostly........use a slip float the same way if you want to twitch em without disturbing the surface.  but I'VE been fish tubes with Buck Tyler for 25 years!......do I hear 30 ? anyone ? LOL  RR"
