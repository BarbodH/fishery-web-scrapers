384227,capt bruce,2009-09-17 15:11:00,820,"""Myself if the weeds are higher and I don't want to burn a single buck in, I've always just used a lighter spinner with a larger blade.""  That will work also , as Raf said baits are just tools , if you put A shiny fishy looking thing in front of a hungry fish IT WILL BITE IT , the trick is to get that bait (shiney thing) in front of or at least near enough for a fish to see it . So its no good to use a heavey single in shallow weeds because you will just be pulling weeds off your bait all day , no matter thats its the lure you caught your biggest fish on . Same as with a shallow running double in deep weeds hard to get the bait down in front of the fish . IF I had alot of big bladed light singles I would do as you do , but for me I just load three rods , one with a large body bait for trolling , one with a big heavey single (big because in the St Law. where I fish most, we get hammer handles bothering you if you go smaller , still get some on big but not as many)and A big double on the last. I choose  the number of blades for  depth mainly , if you can adjust your depth by size of blade and weight , so be it , my point is you have to get the bait in front of the fish , what bait it is ????? I leave to the fish scientists.been guideing for over thirty years and I have not as yet found any magic baits , when bite was good I have caught fish on just about anything on the boat we could put a hook on to that made a flash in the water .."
384246,Uncle Buck,2009-09-17 15:52:00,1000,"Just an FYI... I made 2 doubles and the back 2 wouldn't spin...    Bottom spinner, only the front 2 would spin"
384264,Syn,2009-09-17 16:30:00,519,  Maybe the front two spinners are making so much water turbulence that the back blades can't catch enough water to spin?  or maybe the top two spinners when spinning are pressing the brass beads rearwards and this creates too much friction on the clevises of the back two spinners preventing them from spinning freely. Try soldering in place (or wedging a wood sliver) in the brass bead hole just above the rear two clevises so that there is some space between the rear clevis and the brass bead just above it.
384289,canadadude,2009-09-17 17:18:00,769,"Try smaller blades on the front, I always use at least 1 size smaller on the front of a tandem rig  worm harnesses are the same always use a smaller blade on the front or the rear one won't spin"
384293,tonyb,2009-09-17 17:30:00,1637,Interesting question and answers....my thought was increased water displacement and they are retrieved slower because of the increased resistance.  Great information marc
384429,dada2727,2009-09-18 01:36:00,108,"I guess I can only speak of personal experience, but my big fish catch rate between me and my buddies has gone up almost 400% since we started throwing these things.  Now, that will probably slow down once the fish get used to these baits, but right now they're hot and I'm gonna keep throwin' them till my arms fall off!  And by big fish I mean over 45 inches, which I consider big for teh kawwarthas.  All those big name guides and pros don't throw them because they catch the same as the smaller blades, they make a living catching muskies and it's pretty hard to find another guide other than marc thorpe that doesn't believe in them, no offence Mark, as I wish I knew half as much about muskies as you, but most guides always have atleast one guy chucking these double 10's in their boat.  And I'm guessing a lot of your fishing on the ottawa river is trolling to right?"
384432,solopaddler,2009-09-18 01:39:00,8605,  It's hard to argue with statement.
384434,Roy,2009-09-18 01:48:00,13728," Ummm yes, you make a good point."
384436,Guest gbfisher,2009-09-18 01:56:00,0,Im all confused now....
384499,Marc Thorpe,2009-09-18 11:30:00,621," Nope,I always find funny how some know more about my business than I do,No I did not take it wrong Its just funny  Re-read my post ,you will see I was using # 10 before Cow girls existed,made em myself with single #10 for specific use and purpose We used doubles also,ratio from doubles to singles was the same,same goes for #8 I was using them before they ever became popular  like I said ,if it makes you happy use em Look on the bright side,you might end up having Swarthy ,Chiseled features like I do bwahahahahaha  tell me how good they are 2 years from now Muskies ate Deer 30 years ago and will eat Deer 30 years from now with #8 blades  I will tell you # 8 blades with a deer rear end will still be good 30 years from now  Like I said,its whats used the most that catches the most,after some 20 years I have come the conclusion if it makes you happy use it and if it moves its food  Now if ya want to start a discussion about vibration and noise and how fish get condition to it and learn avoidance,then you will understand where I am coming from You will most probably learn it in 2 years from now  There will always be some that will still bite on them but you will see the avoidance begin to settle in  so go buy all the # 10 you can and start Chucking hahahahahahha   TonyB,I think you know where I am coming from"
384676,Syn,2009-09-18 22:07:00,519,"one blade or two ---who cares, as long as you can get them for cheap.  hehe can't wait to try them out next week.  "
384005,solopaddler,2009-09-16 23:47:00,8605,"I'm a huge fan of oversized inline bucktails for musky and pike and have been for years. I've got dozens of standard single blade bucktails that I've had forever, most collected when I was heavy into musky fishing.  I've noticed that the vast majority of larger inline bucks being sold these days are tandem blades.  Why is that? Are they that much more effective?  Just wondering"
384007,misfish,2009-09-16 23:55:00,29133,"Could it be the same as tandem spinner baits? Resembles a school of bait fish? Well it is said, it gives that effect."
384017,solopaddler,2009-09-17 00:09:00,8605," No, the ones I'm referring to the blades are side by side like this:    Obviously there'd be more thump and flash, but are they that much better than normal bucktails?  I'd love to hear from some musky guys."
384026,Roy,2009-09-17 00:20:00,13728,"Mike, they're a lot harder to pull through the water. Sure they're ok but, IMO the extra Colorado or whatever will not put extra fish in the boat. It WILL however wear your reel gears and arms a lot more quickly. If the two blade ever gets popular, the three blade will be the next ""super"" invention. I have a couple but they don't impress me. You want an extra blade on there?, tag it on the end of the tail treble......just as much flash, much easier on the gears and arms. Hey, it's just my opinion."
384031,solopaddler,2009-09-17 00:29:00,8605,  Roy I'm with you totally. What prompted the question I did a quick search and this type seems to be the most common.
384035,dada2727,2009-09-17 00:34:00,108,"Not sure about it putting more fish in the boat, but it will put BIGGER fish in the boat.  Has worked for me personally, and have seen it work out of the back of my boat as well.  Just watch a few episodes of Musky Hunter and you'll see.  And I'm pretty sure Musky mahem isn't one of the sponsors either.  I forgot the stats on how many fish it's responsible for over 50 inches, but it's mind numbing!"
384038,solopaddler,2009-09-17 00:39:00,8605," Okay, but why do they catch bigger fish? What's the reasoning behind the 2 blades?"
384039,Pigeontroller,2009-09-17 00:40:00,2793,"The ""Double 10"" Inline Bucktail(most have flashaboo, or tinsel as we've always called it) have definately acounted for alot of big fish in the last 3 years. Particularly on LOTW and Mille Lacs in Wisconsin."
384040,solopaddler,2009-09-17 00:42:00,8605," Awesome, but why? LOL!"
384042,Roy,2009-09-17 00:47:00,13728, Must be the flashaboo eh?
384048,Terry,2009-09-17 00:53:00,14456,"are they more productive in dirty water  I would think they would hit each other every now and then, making noise 2 blades more flash and more water displacement all should be important for darker water  but that's just a guess"
384049,Guest gbfisher,2009-09-17 00:54:00,0,Looks like a bigger food item. Makes a wake!......Like a big squirrel or a chipmunk or weasel or large rat....lol Moves more water. Gets more attention. They work but little Pickerel spinners work too.
384121,kickingfrog,2009-09-17 03:31:00,8333,The tandem blades put out more thump so it sounds/feels different for the fish maybe?  Like with other hot/new lure it may just be a case of the fish seeing something different.
384126,Skud,2009-09-17 03:48:00,739,"I have several doubles and they have yet to catch me fish, even in Beteau Lake. A threw one for hours up there without a sniff."
384127,solopaddler,2009-09-17 03:54:00,8605," HAHA! See? There you go.  I have to admit my question was mostly rhetorical, but I was still interested in what people thought. I'll admit they may give off more thump, chatter, flash...whatever. But I think they probably were made to catch fishermen not fish."
384133,Raf,2009-09-17 04:30:00,3495,stick to your singles then!
384136,sconceptor,2009-09-17 05:14:00,146,One of the musky show's on WFN either Musky Hunter or the Esox Angler show did something on tandum inline spinners.  More thump in the water.....they even upgrade their gaint double cowgirls to a larger sized blade at times.   Double cowgirls seem to be the way to go.
384143,Marc Thorpe,2009-09-17 10:32:00,621,"the only reason a particular bait produces more fish is because more people use em Its the new bait craze Just like PT said it was a western bait craze Now the fish run for their lives when they hear the clanging of the 2 blades  I used single # 10 for years,doubles just like Roy said wears anglers and gears down I think I even caught 1 when fishing with Roy on a single # 10 I made do they put up more flash and vibration,sure does it matter to the fish???? nope Does it make the angler happy and build self confidence ???? Yup  I used single #8 blades all season this year,no # 10,I did not see a difference in my capture rate or size Caught just as many on # 8 as I did when we threw # 10 I will say this,a single # 10 does offer more lift when fishing thick weeds  if it moves,its food"
384151,solopaddler,2009-09-17 11:40:00,8605," I think I will.  Thanks for the insightful comment.    Thank you for your input Marc, your confirming exactly what I thought."
384153,Guest gbfisher,2009-09-17 11:50:00,0, You're funny you already knew that.........
384157,solopaddler,2009-09-17 12:00:00,8605," Hey I'm not a musky guy. Just because I think I'm right doesn't make it so. I made the thread to solicit responses from anglers more experienced with these baits than myself, in the hopes that my thoughts would be confirmed.  For all I knew these tandem spinners are like musky and pike kryptonite. Deadly destroyers of giant fish LOL!"
384165,Raf,2009-09-17 12:46:00,3495,"they're just another tool - no doubt their catch rate is high because people are using them & internet lore has spawned 'confidence'.  the two giant blades generate a lot of lift which makes them a great very shallow/bulging bait.  they move a lot of water, their large profile and 'thump' make them a great lure in the dark too.  i use all kinds of different inlines, from giant willowleaf bladed singles to indianas to double 13 colorados depending on the situation.  is it a 'fad' bait? sure.  is it meant to catch fishermen? aren't they all?  is it the same bait as a single bladed? no."
384173,solopaddler,2009-09-17 13:04:00,8605, Some excellent thoughts.  Although I'd argue the point that all baits are meant to catch fishermen.
384184,capt bruce,2009-09-17 13:38:00,820,"When I choose a bucktail , its size and running depth that are my major concerns, (color To me is not so important but I may be wrong there as some will swear by colors). So if the weeds top out at 4 feet or less I go with a double for the more lift I get , 4 feet or more I go with a single. I can get more lift with a single by speeding up my retrieve BUT than I will tire out me and my reel faster . I have also gone with a double in stained water (like lotw) for the more noise they create even when fishing deaper but generally If IM fishing shallow its allways with a double , deep is with a single . But what do I know . I bet if we all just went back to a hook and worm fish will still be caught , dam there are just fish , this is not rocket science lol ... let the flames begin"
384203,solopaddler,2009-09-17 14:22:00,8605,"  More good input. Myself if the weeds are higher and I don't want to burn a single buck in, I've always just used a lighter spinner with a larger blade."
