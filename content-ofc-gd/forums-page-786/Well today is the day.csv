383517,BassMan11,2009-09-15 20:00:00,583,Got mine the week of Aug. 21st. JUst recieved it in the mail yesterday. Its just a cash grab really.
383521,BrownTown,2009-09-15 20:14:00,103,I don;t even own a boat and have mine
383528,Cudz,2009-09-15 20:33:00,2652,"Got mine the other day but had technical difficulties wehn I printed out the temporary copy.  It is tiny!!!  Can't wait to give it to a policeman.  Here you go officer, hope you brought your magnifying glass!  It's wafer thin "
383537,Slop,2009-09-15 21:09:00,151,"Heres a wee tip to print a larger version of the temporary card.  When logged in, go to print temp card. Put your cursor over the actual picture of the card and the right click. Select print picture. This should give you the Fred Flinstone sized version."
383541,Cudz,2009-09-15 21:23:00,2652,I kind of like the mini version.  I want to show it to a cop.
383686,Fishnwire,2009-09-16 02:40:00,983,I don't have one.  I'm really not even sure how to go about getting one.  And I have no intention of doing so anytime soon.  My camp is way in the bush.  I forgot to buy a fishing licence one year and would have made it through the season but I remembered on my own and bought one in September.  No governmnent official has ever made his way out to my neck of the woods and the only laws that apply are self-imposed.  We don't need your stinkin' boat badges where I wet my lines!
383790,Dara,2009-09-16 13:10:00,3052,"  They were just developed to slow down the crazies on the PWC's in southern On. We all gotta pay the price for it. I did learn that the side of the boat that the mainsail is on is called the ""windward"" side. Like, how stupid can a test be?  I have written a few government exams and have found that the hardest ones are the ones that have the simplest subject matter. They feel a need to try and trick you with stupidity if the subject isn't difficult. Its like, a certain number of people have to fail or they haven't done their job."
383795,JohnF,2009-09-16 13:22:00,3494," You nailed it, I think. These regs aren't so much for the responsible people among us, rather for the responsibility challenged. Of course it doesn't guarantee they'll all do any better, but it might keep a few away from boats or make them get smarter about how it all works. Either way it can't lower the bar at all. I kinda like the idea that the card may just stifle a few of the yahoos we've all seen on the water.  Imagine what our roads would be like if there were no driving regs or licensing in place. It's scary enuf with all the rules and the cops on the prowl for offenders. Imagine if every musclehead in a muscle car thought he could let it all out whenever and wherever he felt like it, or every droopypants ricerocketrider thought the highways and byways were his own personal bumper car derby.

383805,Twocoda,2009-09-16 13:33:00,4130,just a reminder ....you are now required by law to carry your trailer registration ...
383807,bushart,2009-09-16 13:35:00,2628,Here's a thought.....  10 million potential licencee's--------2 million obtained=8 million not gots  Say half or even 1/4 go ahead and fish without licence---still leaves bout 4 million dudes sittin at home on da couch cause they aint legal.  Whats it all mean-------Ya Baby way more fish and room on the water for this cowboy  Creeks and wading rivers may be a bit busier though
384591,GBW,2009-09-18 17:26:00,8460,"I ran into the Durham cops today (at Timmy's) with the boat and I asked what's going on with the card.  They said they will fine anyone $305.00 who does not have the card, then he said the course is $50.00 now.  I asked where they were going and he said, out on the water looking for bad guys...  what a joker..."
383335,HTHM,2009-09-15 10:44:00,4082,Got your boaters card yet???
383339,Roy,2009-09-15 10:51:00,13728,Pretty well everyone must have theirs by now.
383346,cambo,2009-09-15 11:09:00,62,"Just got mine on Friday, I'm a bit ofa procrastinator"
383347,tjsa,2009-09-15 11:18:00,1578," You would think that with all the posts about this that it would be true, but I doubt it. Probably only over half of us have the card. I have had it since the first 6 months that it was imposed on us. Being that the cutoff date was mid September 2009, when a lot of us put their boats into sleep mode, I suspect they figure they will now do the test in the upcoming months before spring, if they remember. I know a couple of guys at work who have not not done it yet. I will remind them of the requirement."
383352,bushart,2009-09-15 11:36:00,2628,I'm offishilly a captain  Ya'll can call me Commodore Bushart  Funny thing is though I now have a thirst for Rum and an eye for wenches  AAARGH!!!
383356,backbay,2009-09-15 11:49:00,773,I'm at total last-minute guy. I'll do it this weekend at the marina....
383357,Fish Farmer,2009-09-15 11:52:00,2234,Mines wore out. You can't even read it.I hope they have a Central data base. I've been waiting for a renewal.
383358,Muskieman,2009-09-15 11:53:00,2472,"I passed my course 6 weeks ago or so  and am still running with my  ""yellow"" copy... card is supposed to be here soon.  RFS  "
383364,Roy,2009-09-15 12:07:00,13728," There is no central database. If the shysters you took the test with went under, you're out of luck if you need a new card. Folks who took theirs with any of the Canadian Power and Sail Squadrons are in a bit of a better position.  WOW!  I can't believe how safe our waters will be now!"
383379,Dara,2009-09-15 12:40:00,3052,Yeah...This is gonna be amazing. I got mine Saturday and I feel so much safer for it
383384,JohnF,2009-09-15 12:47:00,3494, Yup. That was the affordable part.  JF
383395,bubbles,2009-09-15 13:08:00,591,"Got mine a couple years ago, what a SCAM!    I am no longer going to wear my helmet while fishing!"
383403,anders,2009-09-15 13:18:00,1168," I was reading a report yesterday and out of the 8 million boaters that require license, only 2 million had it."
383404,Greencoachdog,2009-09-15 13:19:00,8163,  I was born with that!... Yar!
383416,johnnyb,2009-09-15 13:42:00,3413, Friday?!  Hah...I procrastinated right up until Monday
383425,solopaddler,2009-09-15 14:29:00,8605,     Mine was stolen with my wallet a couple years ago. I've been trying to get it replaced but with no central database I'm outta luck. What a joke.
383428,Dara,2009-09-15 14:39:00,3052,  Goes to show the amount of faith we have in our government and their safety laws.  We will protect you from yourself...please pay here.
383433,Skud,2009-09-15 15:00:00,739,Talked to the OPP on Doe Lake. They said less than half had their card when asked.  $300 fine for not having it now
383458,Greencoachdog,2009-09-15 16:19:00,8163,  It shouldn't take more than one of those tickets to get someones attention!  I think the fine down here in Bama is $250.
383461,GBW,2009-09-15 16:32:00,8460,now that's funny! I got mine well over a year ago and thinking I better make a photocopy of it just in case....
383465,SRT8 smoker craft,2009-09-15 16:42:00,1107,  I was going to say the same thing but the report I saw from a the power and sail squadron member was 1.5 million out of 8-10 million boaters had got it by sept 1/09 I won't be getting mine for a couple more weeks as I'm back to work monday after being off for 7 months and won't be using it till I start targeting fall pike and ski's in mid october they will prolly scrap the hole thing in a few years anyways .
383468,Bondar,2009-09-15 16:48:00,817,Got mine last year in june
383471,bushart,2009-09-15 17:01:00,2628,Seriously though I got mine this summer knowing the deadline was Sept. 15 and the best fishin of the year always happens after that date.  Admiral Bushguy
383482,Dara,2009-09-15 17:53:00,3052,  Why would they be asking for something you don't need to have. Today is the day they can start asking for it.
383484,Dara,2009-09-15 17:55:00,3052,  I heard that a $150.00 course was mandatory after the due date.
