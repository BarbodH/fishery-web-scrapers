383059,Stoty,2009-09-14 20:12:00,2910,"Hey all,  As most of you are aware, I am hardcore into hockey pools! I'm willing to set it up, if enough people are interested in joining.  I am thinking 8 teams.  So, let's say the first 7 people to send me a PM with their email address, get in.  It will be a Yahoo! Pool. You need a Yahoo email account to join the pool. If you dont have one, you can sign up in about 45 seconds, lol.  Don't hesitate to ask any questions!  Cheers, *Stoty"
383061,muskeybugged,2009-09-14 20:14:00,282,Cash or bragging rights?
383062,Stoty,2009-09-14 20:14:00,2910,"Bragging rights, sorry I should have mentioned that!"
383063,Stoty,2009-09-14 20:18:00,2910,"Sorry, also....it will be a LIVE ONLINE DRAFT.  Sunday, Sept 20, 7:00pm.  If you cant make it to a computer, then you can pre-rank your players, and the computer will automatically choose your team for you. It will go by your pre-ranking list first, then just choose the next highest ranked player that hasn't been chosen yet. It's a wicked system.  Obviously, if you can be on the computer its much better, then you can choose your own team!"
