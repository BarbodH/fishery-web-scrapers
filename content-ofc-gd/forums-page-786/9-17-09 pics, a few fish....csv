384554,muskeybugged,2009-09-18 15:23:00,282,"An ""OK"" report I guess!  Thanks for sharing.....Thanks for wearing a shirt.... Never would've thunk about the sonar thing."
384555,Leecher,2009-09-18 15:27:00,7832,Great report and pics Glen Been a while since you last posted a report eh and whats up with your face     are you growing facial hair for the winter or something  You certainly got into a great mix bag and that last slab and spot were gigantic Good on ya for figuring the sonar thingny Again great job G and thanks for taking the time to post this excellent report and sharing!!! Jacques
384581,Headhunter,2009-09-18 16:59:00,5703,Nice report GCD! Would it kill yah to put yer life jacket on! LMAO! HH
384585,Roy,2009-09-18 17:17:00,13728," Yeah, Glen sits on his....thinks it might save his ass."
384596,dunner27,2009-09-18 17:58:00,6,Let's be real here my friend........unless you are 11 feet tall those fish are not 9.5 lbs and 4.1 lbs.  The world record is only 10.27 lbs...  http://www.insideline.net/2001/news/world-record-spot.html   If you can't be honest then we are not interested in your posts
384602,bigugli,2009-09-18 18:20:00,6138,"We may have been kept waiting for a report from you, but it was worth the wait.  Some good fish and an equipment tip."
384606,muskeybugged,2009-09-18 18:29:00,282," You'll soon learn about our ""Friend""! hahaa"
384609,dunner27,2009-09-18 18:40:00,6,Oh and here is the world record Crappie 4lbs 8oz........you were so close to the world record on both fish.....wow what a day u had!!!
384610,Whitespinnerbait,2009-09-18 18:54:00,2038,   Slown down there Captian.....  Your sounding more and more like 24/7 everyday....
384627,Greencoachdog,2009-09-18 19:57:00,8163," They come in 4 flavors too!!! Original which is good, Bar-B-Hue is so-so, Baked is too sweet for me... and my favorite, Chilee!!! Kinda like a chilidog in a can!!!    You should be catching more fish than me Johnny!    That was one of the truest statements in the report Ben!    I'l try that next time glen.    If I had it to do over again knowing what I know now, I'd have purchased this unit.  http://www.cabelas.com/cabelas/en/template...&hasJS=true    Damned if I do and damed if I don't Victor!    Can I borrow your digital scale?... you won't be needing it this winter, will you?"
384628,Greencoachdog,2009-09-18 19:58:00,8163," Honest Injun Bubba!    De Sac-a-laits is in for a world of hurt this winter!!!... I Gare-ron-tee!!!    Damned if I do and damned if I don't!!!    I'm trying to look more like you Jacques!!!    Well the water was 80*F, I wasn't around any strong current, I was using the trolling motor to propel the boat, and there were other people whitin earshout... yeah, I prolly shoulda been wearing it!    He don't know me bewy well, do he?    That's what I was trying to tell you in my report!!!... actually I was poking fun at the people that overestimate the size of their fish in their reports, and also making fun of the people that belive the pics of a record/near record fish in a report without proof.  The Crappie was actuall 13"" long, and the Spot was 18 1/2"" long with very thich shoulders... I didn't weigh either fish because I'm not really interested in the weight of any fish under 10 lbs.    That's the same exact thing that the Lovely Miss Stephanie told me!!!"
384630,fishinguypat,2009-09-18 20:05:00,547,get that crappie checked out man you might have some kind of record
384672,Joey,2009-09-18 22:02:00,9122,Great report Glen.  Maybe its not the sonar but your chili farts thats scarin them fish away  Joey
384688,jaydub,2009-09-18 22:50:00,145,"Nice report Glen!  Interesting about the fish finder for sure.  Nice double double header     We Canuktiuks (or whatever you call us) can't get those double headers on our own unless we're ice fishing.  How many rods are you allowed per person in Rednec...I mean Alabama?  P.S.  I know it's been said, but I think that your scale needs some calibrating...that things gotta be at least 9lbs 6oz."
384708,Greencoachdog,2009-09-18 23:39:00,8163," Dammit man!!!... Ireleased it... but I'll catch a bigger one!    The chili fartz is what brings in the BIG cats Joey!!!  The more rotten it smells, the better they like it!!!    On the particular lake I fish we are allowed only 3 rods (but I usually only fish 2) any time of year, it is one of only two lake in the state that has a limit on the number of rods that can be fished... the rest of the lakes are unlimited on the number of rods you can use... you can use 100 or more if you want to.  The 3 rod limit was deemed on Neely Henry (the lake I fish) and Weiss lake (directly above Henry in the Coosa chain) to protect the Crappie population from the ""Spider"" fishermen, they use up to 30 rods per boat and literally can filter out all the keeper Crappie in a body of water in a matter of just a couple of years. Our Crappie have to be a minimum of 9"" long to keep on most lakes but some lakes have a 10"" limit, and we have a creel limit of 30 in addition to the length limit.  We love the Crappie down here and suck them down like they were candy!!!  They're the most popular table fare down here with Catfish a close second!  We don't have any closed seasons on freshwater fish down here, everything is open year 'round!!!"
384780,Dutch,2009-09-19 02:22:00,831,Thanks for sharing GCD.  Nice spots.
384788,ehg,2009-09-19 02:32:00,2666,"Looks like a good day of fishing there GCD  Lots of fish and some big ones in what sounds like tough, debris filled waters.  Nice going!"
384817,snag,2009-09-19 03:33:00,1932,"You just love stirring the pot dontcha??  Your vertical holds are sickening.  Yer canuk wifey phoned,  ""quit smokin'"""
384822,Greencoachdog,2009-09-19 03:51:00,8163,  My Canuck wife would never even speak to your Walrus lookin' ass!!!  sined. yer boyfriend da retnek
384869,dave524,2009-09-19 14:38:00,4508," Nice fishes, you could send a bit of that rain up here, 21 days without here in Niagara and the steelhead are waiting for that first cool rain, expect a big initial run when it happens.  As for the sonar question, I couldn't find what I wanted online but I think the output signal (what the fish hear)on most sonars is constant, the sensitivity adjustment is precisely that, you are adjusting the sensitivity of the unit to the received signal/echo . Hope you understand what I mean, turning down the sensitivity in that case would have no effect on spooking the fish. Maybe there is a sonar guru with tech knowledge could clarify if this is the case?"
384871,Greencoachdog,2009-09-19 15:03:00,8163,"Thanks for the input Dave! I plan to keep using the older weaker unit in shallow water if I want to catch a fish.  ... I'm still kicking myself in the butt for taking it off in the first place!!!  btw... it's been raining cats and dogs here for the last 12 hrs. and the end isn't in sight yet, I haven't checked the rain gauge but I'm sure there's over 50 mm in it!"
385000,Leecher,2009-09-20 00:03:00,7832," I guess you got some tough work ahead of you to try and look like me   :lol: Next time I trim, I'll..... well what I'm trying to say is..... ahhhh never mind..... just razzing ya Jacques"
385005,Greencoachdog,2009-09-20 00:12:00,8163,"  Too late Bubba, I shaved today!... I do find that the mangier I look when going fishing, the more fish I catch... that might also explain your success!!!"
384393,Greencoachdog,2009-09-18 00:05:00,8163,"Got out on Lake Neely Henry at about 10 a.m this morning. Evidently the monsoon type rains we've been having have flooded the lake recently, there was all kinds of Floatsam about! Nasty navigation hazards!!!  This one was about 6' in diameter and I don't know how far it went onder the surface!  This one was about the same size as the first!  This one almost got me, was almost completely submerged and was hidden by the chop on the water... it was about 7 or 8' long and a foot or more wide!  This is a well known deadhead that moves every time the lake floods, I estimate it to be 30-40' long!  So, after carefully traversing the gauntlet of obstacles... I made my way to the dam to check out the action. It was pathetic!!! The fish were gorged and only nibbling at the tail of the spinner and I had to really let them chew on it for a while to get a hook in them... and then they were all small!  They weren't pulling water thru the dam, but did earlier in the morning... and that's when I suspect they fed. All the fish I caught were puking up 1"" shad during the fight and in the boat.  The Dam dinks:  2 or 3 dinky Spots like this.  A dinky Largie  ... and a couple fair sized 'Gills is all I could muster at the dam.  I was fairly disgusted with the action at the dam, so I decided to drop shot the live shiners I bought at my favorite creekmouth.  The action was slow on the dropshot so I decided to eat lunch!  Sonar question answered  Q. Do high powered sonar units spook fish in shallow water?  A. Damn straight they do!!!  Proof  Last year I upgraded from my 2400 watt Humminbird Wide Optic to a 4000 watt Humminbird 747C, it's a beautiful unit with high definition and incredible clarity!!!... BUT!!!... since I've installed it on my boat, I haven't been able to catch anything on the dropshot in less than 25 FOW! At first I thought I'd lost my touch or that the fish just weren't there, but it went on for too long! I then began to suspect the high powered sonar unit was spooking the fish. The fancy 4000 watt unit.  A couple of weeks ago I had some spare time, so I reinstalled the old 2400 watt unit. The old 2400 watt unit.  Whenever I tried dropshotting with the 4000 watt unit in less than 25' of water, I wouldn't see anything or catch anything! Today I put the old 2400 watt to the test, I ran it exclusively in 15-20' of water and let the 4000 watt unit rest.  The results:  Starting off I was beginning to wonder, only a couple small channel cats in 18 fow.    but I knew the fish weren't very active and I stuck with it... well!... at about 1:00 p.m when the started pulling water thru the dam, I was slow trolling my favorite point in 15 FOW and all hell braks loose!!! The rod with the 4 hook Sabiki rig goes off and is jumping wildly in the rod holder, I pick it up and start fighting the fish and then my second rod with the 6 hook Sabiki rig goes off!!!  ... HELL YEAH!!!... I reel up the 4 hook rod quickly and do a rod lift of the fish into the boat, much to my pleasure there was 2 nice sized spots on that rod... then I grab the second rod and start reeling, a little more carefully because the 6 hook rig is a lot lighter than the 4 hook rig... get the rig to the surface and much to my delight there's 2 more Spots!!!... a double doubleheader... by myself!!!   It was pure pandemonium in the boat for a minute with 4 fish flopping around wildly and 9 razor sharp Sabiki hooks flying thru the air... It would have been 10, but a third fish had broken off from the lighter 6 hook rig!  The first 2 Spots that hit the heavier 4 hook rig  The second 2 Spots that hit the 6 hook rig  After that, I thought I'd run back over to the dam and checkout the current and maybe throw for some Stripers for my dinner, but was disappointed when I got there because the were already running 2 turbines and that's a little more current than I want to deal with and it splits the fish up too... so back to the point I go!  So I start doing the slow troll thing again and after a little while I get a surprise!!!  A small crappie from 16 FOW!  Then another surprise!  another small Crappie from 15 FOW!!!... I couldn't believe it, it's not even Crappie season yet!!!  Then a few minutes later another nice hit!  Another nice sized little Spotted Bass!!!  Then a few minutes later... a huge surprise!!!  This Crappie was 17"" long and weighed 4 lbs. 1 oz!!!  ... and then the big fish of the day came!!!  This Spotted Bass hit the light 6 hook Sabiki rig and put up a helluve fight, he even broke water once (and I think he broke wind twice!) This fish was an amazing 25"" long and weighed in at 9 lbs. 5 oz. on my digital scale!!!  Truely an amazing day!!!  In conclusion, is my dinky little 2400 watt sonar unit High Definition?... no... does it have a fancy color screen?... no... does it help me catch fish???... you better bet yer ass it does!!!  Thanks for taking the time to look at a poor old honest Rednecks report!!!"
384399,misfish,2009-09-18 00:26:00,29133,Wow what a report there bud. Nice gentle hold on the fish.You care after all.LOL  I gotz to ask? What the hell is that can?  You gotz beans and wieners in a can? I want some of that.
384402,splashhopper,2009-09-18 00:31:00,2931,9lbs 5 0z?  huh ?  
384405,timmeh,2009-09-18 00:46:00,609,"Nice mixed bag of fish you got there, looks like a great day. Never even thought of sonar scaring off the fish, but results are results."
384406,johnnyb,2009-09-18 00:47:00,3413,Way to go GCD    Want my old Humminbird LCR?  Reeeaaalll old school   Maybe you'll catch even MORE fish!
384407,Greencoachdog,2009-09-18 00:49:00,8163,  You got a problem with that son???

384453,glen,2009-09-18 02:57:00,2641,Nice work on the fish.  The sonar info is interesting.  Thankyou.
384455,glen,2009-09-18 03:00:00,2641,I wonder if it would make a difference if you turn the sensitivity down on the new unit.  Try that for me and report back please.
384457,troutologist,2009-09-18 03:17:00,951,"Quite a day you had good work on the report...lots of variety and some nice sizes.  Interesting on the sonar for sure...the ones Ive been looking at fall into the fish spooking category you mention, which I don't appreciate. I can spook fish quite adeptly on my own without the extra help of electronics."
384459,Victor,2009-09-18 03:18:00,1609,double-double header... all by urself too.. wow.  4lb 1oz crappie? I would have guessed that it's at least 6  Is it just me or we haven't seen one of the signature-topless picture of yours for quite some time?
384460,Guest gbfisher,2009-09-18 03:18:00,0,I'm sure glad I didn't buy a fancy Humminbird. Yup.
384463,Cudz,2009-09-18 03:32:00,2652,about time we got a fishin report from you. Your digital scale is screwed.  That bass fish is 7-8 pounds at the most.  You probably have one of the cheap digital scales.  You need to buy a $18945785 scale if you want to get an actual correct weight.    Nice fish by the way. PS that crappie is a hair under 4 pounds I bet.  You guys from down south always exagerate the size of your fish.
384464,habsforthecup09,2009-09-18 03:32:00,9,"very nice fish GCD,"
384475,ohhenrygsr,2009-09-18 05:00:00,947,Awesome Job and you stink phee whew.  a 4Lb Crappie come on really
384479,Sinker,2009-09-18 05:31:00,8692,"Good info Glen. Another thing is flashers thru the ice. I don 't know how many times I've pounded perch in shallow water, while my buds with thier fancy schmancy high power flashers got one here and there. If I can hear it, a fish can dam well hear it too!!!!  Nice haul too bud.......that one slab is a beast!!!  S."
