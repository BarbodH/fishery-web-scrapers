Anyways, you can get FREE admission into Ontario Place by going to Dave's website and downloading your ticket here:  http://www.factsoffishing.com/news.php?id=73  I wasn't able to make it out last year, but judging by the photos and stories I know the kids will have a ton of fun.... Hope to see you there!  Either way, have a great weekend!  Cheers, Ryan"
