We had a strong west wind, so we ran up to Hawkestone area and north towards Orillia fishing the west shore out of the wind.  Fishing wasnt stellar by any means but we managed to take about 12 fish between us.  Started throwing jerkbaits and spinnerbaits but had nothing but followers.  Gave my dad a dropshot slammer and he caught a few 2.5 pounders.  We have a tourney in a couple weeks, so we kept our biggest 4 each to see our weight at the end of the day, just to get an idea and stay in tournament mode.  After he put some in the box, I tied up a Strike Zone Slammer on a split shot rig and started getting into them pretty good.  No giants today, we each caught a bunch of 3- 3.5's and each had one ""real"" simcoe Smallie.  Fish today were in about 16 feet.          Waiting for use of the launch, I was firing a spinnerbait around and picked up this guy..    Heading over to the west side of the lake tomorrow for some GIANTS"

384768,Cudz,2009-09-19 01:59:00,2652,"West side?  THere are no fish on the west side!  Stay away from the west side!  I repeat, no fish on the west side of Simcoe.  Nice fish Steve.  I have some slammers in a very similar smoke colour.  Just a quick question.  Are you hitting weedbeds?  Just wondering because it looks like you are texas riggin the hook.  I usually nose hook them with a 1/0 or 2/0 octopus or circle.  I guess draggin on the bottom like that you are just getting less snags.  I have often thought about carolina rigging or split shot rigging the slammers but I tend to just go with the old faithful dropshot rig.  PM sent."
