382640,pikehunter,2009-09-13 12:06:00,1659," Misfish here's the story. The picture was taken at in Boca Raton Florida 1961 or 1962? when I was a little guy, that's me looking on in amazement   as my father held up the king for the picture. It was probably taken at a the motel owned by my fathers friend where we stayed when we first moved to Fla. My father was astounded by deep sea fishing and loved fresh water fishing as well. I can remember going on several charters with him and my mother and he would drive us down to the docks almost daily to see the catch come in on the boats.  I posted this picture as a memorial on the passing of my father 2 years ago come October 1st. He loved fishing and if he was still here today and computer savvy he would have loved OFC . My memories of moving to Florida at the age of 5 and the short time there are among the best memories I have, even though they are a little sketchy and get a little more vague as the years flow past."

I still wear that lid, all sweat encrusted and grotty, as a fishing cap, although then it was socially acceptable golfwear.  My wife has declared it too disgusting for the Country Club now though. I have replaced it with a sweet smelling pristine unstained Ping hat better suited to friendly stroke play & the club bar.
