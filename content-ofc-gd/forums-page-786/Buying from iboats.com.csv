383773,scugpg,2009-09-16 12:18:00,1373,Anyone ever ordered parts/accessories from iboats.com ? They take care of all the duties etc for Canadians just wondering if anyone has had good/bad experiences ordering from them.
384145,boatman,2009-09-17 10:44:00,350,"I ordered a prop from them a couple years ago. They had the best price on the prop I wanted. I still had to pay customs, though."
384155,Fish4Eyes,2009-09-17 12:00:00,1022,"Ordered my boat seats from them. It took about 3 weeks, but I liked the fact that I knew how much it would cost for it to arrive at my door (brokerage included). Their prices cannot be beat if you look around. I saved 60$+ a seat compared to bass pro and cabela's prices. They also had good customer service when I called to ask when they would arrive. I would definetely order from them again"
384169,scugpg,2009-09-17 12:50:00,1373,Thanks guys. A $37 light I want is going to be almost $100 by the time someone here special orders it in. I can have both a light and base to my door $75US shipped.
384510,Fish4Eyes,2009-09-18 12:26:00,1022,Told ya!
384528,scugpg,2009-09-18 13:43:00,1373," Haven't ordered yet but I called them because 2 items (light and base) were to ship from 2 different locations....so it was $25 shipping per item  The person on the phone discovered one was out of stock in the other warehouse, and told me when it would be back in stock so they could both ship from same spot thus cutting shipping in half"
384572,Fish4Eyes,2009-09-18 16:21:00,1022,"You can't be in a rush when ordering online, most suppliers take a while. I have ordered items from bass pro and cabelas that have taken upwards of 6-8 weeks. Thats ridiculous."
384598,Uncle Buck,2009-09-18 18:07:00,1000,My cabelas order come in 6-10 days thats without paying for the quicker shipping...
