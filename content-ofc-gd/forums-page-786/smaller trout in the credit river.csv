384045,timmeh,2009-09-17 00:50:00,609, Enjoy your time fishing now. I think you may find once you start working you'll have less time to fish than when you're in school. I've certainly found this true. Anyhow best of luck on the weekend. I've been meaning to get out there all season but haven't yet.
384088,chandru,2009-09-17 01:56:00,63,that's too bad i really hope my pans get set right im in nursing and shifts always run 12 hours 3-4 days on and about the same off with those stretches of days off i'll go insane if i dont fish man!
384412,maicolg,2009-09-18 01:03:00,1,"Hi Every body I am new to the forum and to this sorts of things, But I want to help chandru since he wont find much information on Erindale Park referring to resident trout. A little info about me. I had been fly fishing for the last 4 years love it every minute, but at the beginning  I was in the same position that you are now no money and no time to go far, so I heard about Erindale park it's 15 minutes away from me. so I start going to Erindale park since I could not afford going any where else. My first year I did not caught anything, but I figure good water flow even during the summer good hidden spots lots of food (insects ) .....there must be fish living there and calling that stretch of the river home... to make my story short finally a dialed in  my technique and presentation and bum i got my first trout a little ( 4 inches ) rainbow trout that was photograph and put back and the river. I fish Erindale park in fall summer and even winter. Resident fish is not big 4 to 14 inches ( salmon and stealth head are big but they are seasonal runs ), so my advice go try even if you do no catch any trout you will have fun with chubs and suckers but if you want big browns yes you need to hit the upper Credit River as every one said. I attached one picture of a rainbow caught sep 16 2009 at erindale park very close to the parking lot with a bushy #16 hair nymph brown color one split shot 10 inches from the fly a 5x 12 foot long leader  tapper to 7 x with a indicator at between 4 and 5 foot from the fly"
384470,chandru,2009-09-18 04:08:00,63,thankyou for the advice hopefully i can try all that tomorrow im hoping angling specialties carries mayfly nymphs.
384567,BillM,2009-09-18 16:15:00,17367," As in live bait?   Some sections of the river don't allow live bait, only artificials."
384727,chandru,2009-09-19 00:22:00,63,oh no i was actually talking about artificials. mayfly immitations.
383539,chandru,2009-09-15 21:21:00,63,"hello everyone,  im new to the site, just wanted to put my question out there...  im looking for some spots to try fly fishing for some resident trout. just picked up fly fishing, looking to practise and catch some fish. i know the season ends soon so id like to get in some action before then. i live in mississauga near square one if anyone knows any good areas other than erindale....:-p its so busy there! i would be wading most of the time. any intersection names and directions to locations that are within 30 mins would be greatly appreciated. (im a 4th year nursing student very low on gas money!!!! closer the better but i want some results too....) thankyou for your time and any advice would be appreciated!"
383551,Paully,2009-09-15 21:56:00,712,Goooooood Luck...  You're askin for alot...  Try erindale park....
383558,Musky or Specks,2009-09-15 22:14:00,2710,LOL just LOL
383568,johnnyb,2009-09-15 22:40:00,3413,"Welcome to the board, Chandru   You may find that asking for spots--especially spots for native trout on the credit-- has a bit of a low success rate.  Here's what I can tell you about the Credit and trout: 1) Pay attention to the special regulations and access areas...most of which are posted, but check your regs summary as well 2) Start scouring the net for info....it's out there...I've done okay by googling and driving.  And walking.  And fighting off biting ants  Good luck!"
383586,StoneFly,2009-09-15 23:33:00,574,"How long have you been flyfishing?  How many resident trout have you caught?  If you want Residents, they are up and down every stretch of pretty much every river!!!  We catch them by accident all the time while going after bigger game.  I assume you know what to look for and where to cast?  The ones we have caught are in the 12-14"" range generally, and they are fun for sure.  Best way and most satisfying is to learn on the river, not ask for on the internet where to go.  BTW, whoever mentioned 'Native trout', the only natives we have around here are lakers and specks and I doubt any will be had within 30 min of Mississuaga, on any river, unless of course you drive 250km/hr to Niagara, lol.  Rainbows and Browns are not 'native', they are introduced, arguabley have established themselves to a degree as 'Wild'.    Cheers and goodluck.  By the way, what weight is your flyrod?  There are some Bigass salmon in some tribs right now, we catch them on flies but not with a flyrod, there are much better ways.  Please no comments on lining or snagging...PLEASE...its done to death already, lol."
383609,solopaddler,2009-09-16 00:21:00,8605, Most every Lake O trib has native brookies in the headwaters.
383615,wallacio,2009-09-16 00:32:00,475,"If you are after ""smaller trout"" ie resident fish, the Upper Credit is a reasonable drive from Mississauga - 30-40 minutes.  As mentioned, no one is going to post specific directions however I suggest focussing your efforts almost anywhere above the Village of Inglewood.   Between and Inglewood and the Cataract you'll primarily find Browns.    Above the Cataract, it's Brookie water.     There are lot's of access points at road/trail crossings and unless it's posted land, you are usually good to go.  There are limited hatches right now so I would stick to nymphing for your best chances of hooking up.  Because of the fishing pressure and the fact that it's all C&R water, the fish get educated quickly so don't expect easy success but if you put in the time, it can be incredibly rewarding.  Here are a few shots of what lurks up there to get you motivated!!!   Good luck!                  "
383641,BillM,2009-09-16 01:12:00,17367,God I hate nymphing...  
383646,wallacio,2009-09-16 01:19:00,475, That's 'cause you suck at it!
383649,BillM,2009-09-16 01:21:00,17367, Definitely the most frustrating type of fishing I've done yet.
383693,chandru,2009-09-16 02:54:00,63,"wow lol i had no idea this was such an active community! thats awsome thankyou so much to all of you, thanks for the pics they definately do help to motivate! i will be heading up this weekend and yeah i was checking out the google earth maps north of inglewood the river has alot of bends up there im expecting some nice eddies to cast into.  as for the nymphs... anything in particular?"
383703,jjcanoe,2009-09-16 03:10:00,744," Yep what he said,  look for flyfishing only areas, Trout season closes at the end of September except as noted in the extended seasons section of the regs.  Good luck.  jjcanoe"
383722,StoneFly,2009-09-16 03:50:00,574," So from Mississauga, you have maybe 3 main tribs that all meet in the same spot really,...arguable that u cant get there in 30 min from Erindale unless driving real fast,....and yes they are stocked,..but have any been caught over 8 ""?  meamning do they take? and shhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh"
383770,wallacio,2009-09-16 12:07:00,475," The Brook Trout in the west end headwaters are not stocked and other than a limited Brown Trout stocking program on the upper Humber, the Browns are wild too.    Brook Trout over 8"" are definitely present in relative abundance - as with any resident fish, they get tougher to catch as they get bigger but I've fooled my share of bigger Brookies on flies up there.  As for nymphs, most of those fish in the pictures took various Mayfly nymph patterns.   I like Prince Nymphs, Pheasant Tails, Copper Johns etc...all with lots of ""triggers"" such as gold or copper bead heads, gold ribs, and even crystal chenile in the place of real peacock herl on the thorax portion of the fly.   Don't be afraid to go big as well - ie #10 or even #8 flies as opposed to the typical #14 and#12 sizes...they get the attention of bigger fish!"
383775,chandru,2009-09-16 12:28:00,63,thanks for the fly advice I'll be sure to pick some up on Friday!!!
383786,BillM,2009-09-16 13:00:00,17367, Check the regs to make sure you are not fishing out of season
383791,aniceguy,2009-09-16 13:12:00,1094,  god time you bring a 4 wt and show me the ropes lol
383806,chandru,2009-09-16 13:35:00,63, i checked the cvc website and it currently says the trout season ends sep 30? .... please correct me you know otherwise! i wouldnt want to get booked on my second time out fly fishing!
383809,BillM,2009-09-16 13:41:00,17367,  Any trout fishing you'll wanna do now will most likely occur south of the 407  Everything else is pretty much closed. (check the exceptions in the regs)
383817,wallacio,2009-09-16 14:07:00,475," Chandru is correct Bill - there are still two weeks to go in the regular Trout season, including the Upper Credit.     Good luck if you go!"
383818,chandru,2009-09-16 14:13:00,63,I'll definatly be heading up with a buddy on Sunday wow reading all these posts is really getting me amped! If I didn't have to finish up school this year I'd be out there every day but of course I'll have time for that after graduation and the cash starts rolling in! Or so I hope LOL
383842,BillM,2009-09-16 15:14:00,17367,"  Why the hell do I think it's October?  Seriously, all this travel is messing up my brain."
383895,chandru,2009-09-16 18:25:00,63,LOL well the travel must be nice atleast !
383901,BillM,2009-09-16 18:58:00,17367," I dunno man, my brain isn't working right  Let us know how you make out!!  (also pinch the barbs so you don't kill any of those pretty little fish)"
384004,chandru,2009-09-16 23:44:00,63,good tip thanks for that. i will definately let you know how i did thanks for all the help!
