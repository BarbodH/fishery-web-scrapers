384342,skinny,2009-09-17 21:16:00,442,just wanted to send out a thanks to splashhopper we met up today and his pontoon boat is now mine. I'm hoping to use it to go to some places I can't get the tinner into due to access  Splashhopper has also sent me pm's on lots of the subjects I have posted . He seems always willing to help    great guy
