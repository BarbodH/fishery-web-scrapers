379363,CLofchik,2009-09-03 04:51:00,854," Seeing as how there were only 54 returning Atlantics recorded last year I'm assuming you were hitting a school of stocked yearlings before they returned to the lake.  For every Atlantic you caught I'd take 100 returning bows or 200 returning Kings for the same investment in hatchery space & stocking power.  THAT'S the next best thing.  Chinook salmon will be gone from Lake Ontario in a few years, a casualty in a political war that has been waging for many years.  Nobody really thinks that Atlantics will provide a viable angling opportunity,  but while there are many agendas at work promoting Atlantics, angling is at the very bottom.   Game, set, match.   You do know there's a big question mark with the reliability of Scale Pattern Analysis, somehow in a decade we've gone from a 2% reproductive rate to 50%.  Not to mention the bios that authored this now infamous and oft quoted paper are balls deep in Lake O's Atlantic program, hmmmmm  Either way there'll be a rebuttal to the wild spawning argument in a few years with the mandatory fin clipping going on."
379378,wallacio,2009-09-03 10:54:00,475,"  Yeah, and the ""experts"" that are always refuting the results of the study are almost always those who have a selfish interest in seeing more Chinook stocking (ie the downrigging crew including charter captains).    The eastern tribs support natural reproduction of Steelhead but not Chinook, whose smolts spend even less time in the rivers (and don't tell me that the Eastern Steelhead are primarily strays from US stocking programs)???  The adipose clipping will provide a rebuttal?   So you already know the outcome of the study before it's complete?"

385161,john from craa,2009-09-20 14:28:00,39,"Some funny posts...I was wondering what Dave has been doing after work.  With respect to a few questions and comments:  Streetsville fishway - it is a fish ladder and if opened every jumping specie can pass.  Pacifics are held back for egg collection (under the fmp as Rich noted), trout, Atlantics, bass, sucker and all native species are lifted.  CRAA volunteers have operated the fishway for the MNR since 1991.  Norval fishway - I have been working on this project for 12 years, getting the land owner on board and going through the long delays of the FMP and red tape.  The MNR is very supportive and CRAA and MNR are working closely to get the project done.  I spend several hours every week dealing with engineers, designs or other matters for this project alone.  If all goes well it wil be built in the next 8 months.  Wild chinooks - A new study done in NY on the Salmon River shows roughly 60% of chinooks are wild in Lake Ontario (not the bios involved in Atlantic studies).  As noted above, in 2011 we will know for sure.  Early creel studies on small salmon this summer are pointing to a 50:50 ratio of wild versus adipose clipped chinooks under 4 pounds.  Chinooks are also begining to adapt to our tribs and more are staying until fall or even for a full year in Eastern tribs (based on MNR and CA electro-shocking data).  This has been found on some Gbay tribs since the late 90's (MNR and U of G info).  Chinooks are also adapting to the thiamine shortage, as their offspring are surviving in both wild and hatchery.  CRAA has documented wild chinook fry in large quantities in the Credit since 1998!  Some years are good, some are poor.  Anchor ice and spring floods seem to be the main factors in poor year classes.  More river access would likely improve natural reproduction dramatically on the Credit.  Wild coho - in 2006 three tribs of the lower Credit were found to have wild YOY (young of the year) coho salmon.  Coho are stocked at an older age so they were wild fish.  Funny, they got past Streetsville even without the fishway.  So do many steelhead.  Brook trout - First off, 99.8% of the wild, self sustaining brook trout populations exisit above barriers that lake fish (except Atlantics) and resident browns do not have access too.  There is a very short section (200m) of a major trib that brookies and rainbows can overlap at present due to adult transfers.  This still provides over 2/3 of the watershed to brook trout water only.  There are two other tributaries that support brook trout in the middle section.  One is separated by a large dam.  This trib has seen over 10,000 trees planted and a bunch of cattle fencing, and rehab done by CRAA.  The other trib only became a cold water section last fall, after work initiated by CRAA in 1998.  The trib was hitting 30.5C in 1998.  With our partners on the project (MNR, CVC, OS, etc) we added 2.5km of cold water habitat by removing a 3 acre on-line pond, dropping water temps by an astounding 6-7C.  This summer electro-fishing found good numbers of brookies where they had not been (since sometime in the 1800's or so).  Guess what else they caught, Atlantics, browns and rainbows.  All together - uh oh!    The bottom line is lake run steelhead will not be entering 99.8% of the brook trout water - so why all the concern?  With rehabilitation and other work CRAA is trying to grow the brook trout population and habitat.  I'd like to see more people get involved in that sort of work with CRAA rather than the 'don't hurt them' comments.  How about more 'let's help them' comments!!!!!  Brook trout - CRAA is heavily involved in trying to protect their habitat and rehabilitate lost populations. We are also involved in helping any migratory brookies as rare as they are (wait till my next post).  Brook trout - as Louis noted, are in serious trouble in the headwaters and a sewage treatment plant appears to be the culprit.  Some water samples and fish survival data has been taken, but no major action has been made by the group involved to stop the problem (that I am aware of).  One site that normally produced 50-150 brookies every summer is now just about void of trout.    Very sad.  Most brook trout populations that have been lost in Ontario were damaged by habitat destruction, dams, ground water takering or polution, water polution and my favourite, stocking onto wild populations and breeding out the wild genetics (oops).  Because browns and bows are able to survive in the degraded habitat and have grown populations they are often blamed for the brook trout decline.  Just like lamprey have been demonized for the lake trout crash in the 1940's, but that was recently proven to be pollution that caused the crash.  I grew up fishing two major brook trout creeks that are both all but void of trout today.  The first (upper Pine) was supported solely by stocking in the 70's.  Steelhead utilize the habitat too and some blamed them.  Nope, it was stocking and the 5 acrea lake that warmed the water 5-6C just upstream.  On the other (tiny trib of the Geen) it was over fishing.  Any brookie over 3"" was taken and this remote stream had boot tracks and full creels from many a trespasser.  Atlantics - while genetically they are not identical, the specie is still a native fish.  The extinct population was derived from ocean salmon 10,000 years ago.  The specie adds a new component to the fishery.  A few hundred Atlantic's are not taking away any other salmonids so why all the fuss?  American strays - I noted Clofchick said 1/3 of eastern tribs fish are strays?  NY clips about 1/2 their stocked rainbows every year.  Yet in the Ganny US clips account for less than 1% of the run.  On the Credit (largest north shore river) US clups account for 3-10 fish out of 1000-1500 per year (or about 0.5%).  Accounting for unclipped NY stockers this still only gives us 1-2% NY strays, not 33%.  Stray rates are very low, as we have only had 2 Credit fish reported from eastern tribs, out of several hundred tag returns (one in duffins, one in Bowmanville).  Steelhead declines - Some MNR bios beleive it is caused by lower lake survival, yet this is not supported by other Great Lakes research and annual fluctuations in river juvenile production.  Rivers produce young based greatly on the summer weather and winter freezing.  Some year classes are huge (like 1992, 1994, 2008, 2009), others are very poor.  The subsequent return rates in following years changes based on this.  While the lake is a bottleneck to survival, runs can easily increase 50% from one good year class.  What causes the strong year class to then slowly disapear?  Angler over-harvest and natural mortality.  We cannot control the latter, but we can control the harvest.  Look at www.northshoresteelhead.com for more info.  Look at research links for portage creek.  The bottom line - we need to see a lot more of you getting involved in rehab efforts!  Many hands make light work.  Tight lines,  John"
385176,Steve,2009-09-20 15:20:00,2075,"""A few hundred Atlantic's are not taking away any other salmonids so why all the fuss? ""  John, say what? A few hundred?"
385203,CLofchik,2009-09-20 17:41:00,854," Then explain the fantails that show up every year?  They can only come from NY hatcheries and there's a few caught out of the Ganny every year, and I've seen atleast two in the flesh come out of the Wilmot.  Given they're a genetic hatchery anomaly that only happens with one fish out of a thousand, if there's one fantail odds are there are several hundred of his hatchery brethren around.  Not dozens.  If you have a run of 10,000 fish, then an extra 500 doesn't really have an impact.  But when that run drops to 3000, suddenly that 5% has become a more substantial part of your run.   Oh and apparently you missed the memo from the MNR, the correct wording should be ""take away all other salmonids for a few dozen Atlantics""."
379067,laszlo,2009-09-02 13:59:00,487,Does anyone have any info on what the MNR plans on doing to improve The Credit River? I think there is a fish ladder at the Streetsville Dam but the dam itself is difficult to pass or can't be passed.  Also I've heard that the Norval Dam can not be passed at all.  Is the MNR working to address these issues? If so how would this improve the fishery?  Thanks  Laszlo
379070,BillM,2009-09-02 14:20:00,17367,Leave the steelhead where they are and let the resident brook trout prosper.
379100,Hairpy,2009-09-02 15:23:00,73,"Bill , the steelhead need the upper stretches to successfully spawn if we want to improve things. They can live just fine with the brookies.  Joseph"
379101,bigreddog,2009-09-02 15:24:00,84,"Check with the Credit River Anglers Association.  They are the organization that is driving most of the rehabilitation work around the Credit, including managing the dam and fish ladder in Streetsville, and coordinating the transfer of fish above the dam in Norval.  Also, the Norval dam is a privately-owned structure, so it will continue to exist for the forseeable future.  However, there are plans for a fishway to be built so that fish can bypass the structure, similar to what's currently in place for Streetsville -- including the ability to manually operate in order to block or separate fish.  I suspect that there will also be a new barrier built above the spawning areas in order to protect the indigenous brook trout populations."
379102,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-09-02 15:25:00,0,I'M WITH BILL!
379108,laszlo,2009-09-02 15:34:00,487,I just read a couple long articles regarding these issues. Seems like there are a lot of different opinions going around. Removing dams seems to solve some issues and create others.
379112,ehg,2009-09-02 15:55:00,2666,"Have caught atlantics, fairly large browns, and rainbow trout at the Forks of the Credit area along with decent brookies. Only the Atlantics and Brook trout could be considered native to the fishery, so there is some introduced and stocked invasive species above the Norval dam. Keeping the Pacific salmon out of there might be good since they don't spawn successfully much anyways."
379132,CLofchik,2009-09-02 16:54:00,854," 1)  The strain of Atlantics being used are no more native to the Credit than the browns & bows.  There's actually plenty of argument to say that after 100 generations or so bows are more native to the Great Lakes than any East Coast transplants.  2)  Pacific salmon never had a shot at successfully spawning in the Credit because of the mentioned dams keeping them out of any areas they (or any other migratory fish) need to spawn.  There simply isn't any suitable stretches below Streetsville, which is the way the MNR wants it to stay.  Streetsville isn't a ladder, but a trap to stop migratory fish unless they are physically lifted over.  Salmon don't get that oppurtunity, that's reserved for the trout and the vaunted Atlantics (who get a limo ride right to the Forks).  The CRAA folks will be able to answer alot more question about the bows but I believe they worked hard to finally lift bows above Norval, so you should see them start to reproduce in the numbers they should.  3)  Contrary to the fears of the tweed wearing spaghetti whipping fly fishing folks migratory trout & natives can and do coexist on the same rivers just fine.  More steelhead doesn't mean less headwater natives."

379190,Richard S.,2009-09-02 19:18:00,75," Chinooks do successfully spawn below streetsville because unlike steelhead, coho's, and browns they smolt out in may the same year they hatch before the lower river gets to hot. Streetsville does have a ladder and it does work, all fish can make it over when allowed. Now the reason the Pacific’s aren't allowed above streetsville is because the credit river fisheries management plan does not allow them too. As the FMP stands now Pacific’s are allowed up to streetsville, migratory trout are allowed up to Norval, and atlantics which are a native species are allowed un-restricted access to every part of the credit river and it's tributaries.  When the ladder gets built in Norval, which is going to be happening this year. An electro barrier built in Inglewood, migratory trout will be allowed access up to Inglewood and Chinooks hopefully will be allowed to Norval.   Rich."

Sadly with the demise of the green drake population, poor water quality due in most part I suspect to Orangevilles poor sewage treatment practices thier range is soon to be less and less, sad considering some user groups  and in particular one of thier bio's on the Credit does'nt want CRAA's help with it go figure  .  Since we can safely say there is no measerable brook trout population below the East Credit, then all species of salmonids are non native and as such should all be allowed to intermingle that should include brown trout rainbow trout coho chinook and Atlantics, if someone wants to prove to me there is a difference between a migratory and resident fish beyond life stages Im all ears but until then I ll stand by my comment. Sadly some stakeholders like TU and Issiac Walton in past didnt see it that way and we have the current credit scenerio where Rainbows cant access .above the papermill dam without a barrier Chinooks and Coho's are scurge of the earth ( in thier eyes ) and cant access above Streetsville) and even browns out of the lake cant get dropped at the cataract because they are some how different then the ones up there ...again go figure.  It is inappropriate for ANY angling group be it migratory guys or as said earlier tweed wearing spaghetti whipping fly fishing folks )thanks man that was a good chuckle) to be allowed to have special access to any water for any reason.  I had an elderly man come to me almost in tears because someone on the upper chastised him for bringing his grandson to fish and heaven forbid he had a worm on, a typical mentaility of how some in the upper watershed care only about thier experience but could care less about anyone elses.  Now to dam mitigation, there are hundreds of dams on the Credit from some with heads in the double digits to some that are mearly a speed bump, many are in disrepair, many provide some species segregation, but for the most thety should all be gone. Its a long ardious process to remove a dam as not only are land owner rights involved but as you see above stakeholders will argue the smallest of facts.  For the record i wish they all were gone. Norval is scheduled to recieve an active fish ladder this year, we are in the advance stages of design and are inches from seeing it start construction, while I knwo many bash the MNR this is one project where the district the local bio and even the Minister want to all see happen."
