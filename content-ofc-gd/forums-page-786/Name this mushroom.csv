384358,Aaron`,2009-09-17 22:08:00,25,From what I understand those are poisonous. I forgot the name and I may be wrong since it's been awhile.
384360,Roy,2009-09-17 22:14:00,13728,"Offhand, it looks like a Fred. I see the lil' dickens who chomped on Fred also had a side of green salad."

384364,Aaron`,2009-09-17 22:19:00,25,Ahh here we go.  I believe it's called Amanita muscaria or Fly Agaric  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amanita_muscaria
384395,Rob,2009-09-18 00:07:00,467,"I thinks its called a mushroom  I thought you were suppose to take picture of deer with that bait camera?  Good luck huntin this fall Brian, may nobody pee near your stand!  Rob"

384400,brkygetr,2009-09-18 00:27:00,425,"not sure if it is Agaric or not, just looked through the Autubon Society Feild Guide to Shroomy goodness, either way its orange/red and that means do not touch or eat!!!!!Unless otherwise advised.Either way I am sure it is a member of the 'Amantia' family which is often deadly. So no, don't eat it!!! lol"
384413,Daplumma,2009-09-18 01:04:00,1961,Now thats funny there.
384431,keram,2009-09-18 01:39:00,585,"Difficult to say 100%, but in 99%    I think it is Amanita pantherina (Panther Cap) It is one of those, that can be eaten only once. I prefer different kind for the table Some of the â€œcatch"" from last 3 weeks      "
384454,Joey,2009-09-18 02:58:00,9122,"I found a mushroom I thought was a morel in my backyard a few years ago (it ended up being one but I was too afraid to eat it).  What stuck with me tho was a sobering saying I found on a website about mushrooms.  Something to the effect of ""One of two things will happen when you eat a mushroom, you will live or your will die.""  Sobering words for sure.  Joey"
384456,4thgen,2009-09-18 03:11:00,157, This is correct. They are coming up all over the place around here right now. The boletes are coming up as well -- it's always nice to find a big porcini.
384473,ohhenrygsr,2009-09-18 04:55:00,947,Can anyone name these  
384515,capt bruce,2009-09-18 12:47:00,820,"henery you bad , eaten a few of those in my day , Mis stay away from the Amanita muscaria , ate a few of those myself ,was a time a wanted to return to my viking beginnings , Im old now and a little (very little) smarter .. lol was up in Bancroft on the weekend and could not believe all the different kinds of mushrooms that I found , in just one 2 hundred yard meadow I found 27 different kinds ."

384522,Ziki,2009-09-18 13:25:00,128,"Psilocybin mushrooms, something everyone should experience at some point in their lives."
384525,Kawartha Kev,2009-09-18 13:39:00,281,I believe it is an Amanita but not the Fly Agaric that has been suggested it is more likely the Amanita flavoconia which is the most common Amanita around. The fly agaric is deeper orange rather than the yellow colour of this mushroom. The damage done to the mushroom is probably from slugs but I would not want to eat it all Amanita species are not edible beware. Here is a site with info about it Mushroom Site  Kawartha Kev
384526,highdrifter,2009-09-18 13:40:00,2534,"mmhmmm yip flavivolata!!  Sure brings back a lot of sweet memories...  Boiled in a tea, it's effects are a lot like those of leaf buttah!!  Good one dude.  HD"
384530,BITEME,2009-09-18 13:50:00,1968,Psilocybin mushrooms
384539,Dara,2009-09-18 14:18:00,3052,"Try it misfish...if you're still posting a week from now,,,we'll know it was edible...if not, well, we'll know that too"
384542,Dara,2009-09-18 14:19:00,3052,  I don't believe they are for everybody
384550,4thgen,2009-09-18 15:01:00,157," Amanita muscaria has many sub-species based on colour variation. Regardless of what variety it is, it is still A. muscaria. The majority of ours up here are white, yellow and pale orange. I've heard you can make tea out of them but you will feel pretty rough before the muscimol and ibotenic acid do their job.  If you want the Psilocybes, you would have better luck out on the east coast."
