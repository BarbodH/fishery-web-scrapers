380950,Terry,2009-09-08 22:52:00,14456,that great good luck  smallmouth     largemouth    and a bit of reading  might help http://www.strikeking.com/journal/00210/1.php http://www.angelfire.com/home/lake/lmsmall.html http://www.angelfire.com/home/lake/lmlarge.html http://www.wmi.org/bassfish/reports/151914.htm
380951,Roy,2009-09-08 23:10:00,13728,"I hope you do well. It's one of the best bass lakes in the US/Canada. I'm 45 minutes from there, where will you be staying?  Edit: OK, I assume you'll be in Ticonderoga on the NY side."
380967,darsky,2009-09-08 23:46:00,586,you need to decide on a smallie or largie bag and focus efforts accordingly.Water temps are dropping and smallies will be schooling.Be ready for multiple fish of same size coming in with hooked fish. Best of luck and I hope the winds are light.
381027,Fang,2009-09-09 01:18:00,1330,"After seeing them so much on fishing shows and trying them with very good success this year I'd pack a few 4-5"" swim baits. Biggest SB for me this year have come on them. I rig them texas rigged with a 1/2 weight and burn them just like a spinner bait over and around cover."
381123,ohhenrygsr,2009-09-09 03:10:00,947,I wouldn't downsize your gear just put it in a tube and drag it behind the boat lol
381129,spinnerbaitking,2009-09-09 03:17:00,1622,"Thanx Guys I love this Quote but my boater may not like that, I made the team as a Non Boater so will be limited to the amount of room they give me, I haven't had much luck on the swimbaits, I have a lot of Bassmagnets and some other brands but they haven't worked for me, but OK I'll take them just in case, I've been surfing the net,watching shows And reading articles Thanx Richard "
381207,Harrison,2009-09-09 13:35:00,2202,If it was me.  5 Rods.  1- 6lb flouro - drop shot 2 - 8 lb flouro -  1/8 tube 3-  8 lb flouro -  1/4 tube 4- 20lb braid - jerkbait 5 - 20lb braid - topwater (sammy/pop r)  Find the deepest weedlines you can adjacent to deep water.  Find 5 or 6 stretches of them and rotate. Just something else to try.  Good Luck
381469,misfish,2009-09-09 22:35:00,29133,I would listen to him.^^^^^^^^^  Best of luck.
381833,Harrison,2009-09-10 16:07:00,2202," Sorry, just saw you are a non boater. (above post is SMB)  If you hop in with a LMB guy  1,2,3 rods - Extra heavy flipping stick - 80lb braid - topwater frog bait.  (you'll probably be back boated, this is a wicked bait to open up more water for you to fish and for following up and fishing the same water your boater just fished) 4 - 17lb flouro - spinnerbait / buzzbait (same reason as above when your out of the junk) 5 - 50lb flipper/pitch rod - incase you can deck fish with your boater.  If your boater wants to mix it up during the day, you best get a tube like Henry said  Hope this helps.  Brian, their on fire! lol"

383112,spinnerbaitking,2009-09-14 22:36:00,1622,"2nd practice day in, 1 lmbass on the frog this morning & then we ran for smallies, had 1 follow on a break from 13' to 24', caught 1 on a jerk bait & had 2 more follow left there, found a couple more spots that looked good but no takers, Dave got a nice pike on a crankbait & we caught a few perch all over the place, sounds like it was a little tougher for some of the other guys , 1 more practice day Richard"
