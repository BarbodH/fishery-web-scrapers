809357,Stoty,2013-09-25 02:47:00,2910,"Hey all, we have ONE spot left in the pool and we have to fill it or else we can't draft tomorrow (Wednesday) night. Anyone else interested in joining? PM me with your email address ASAP please!"
809426,Christopheraaron,2013-09-25 18:08:00,3525,if we don't get someone is the whole thing off or just postponed? One more is needed I could make another account and it would just be a dummy...
809477,LefroyFisherman,2013-09-25 22:28:00,602,"I'm the 11th guy, I'd like to play..."
809485,Stoty,2013-09-25 23:08:00,2910,"The pool is a go. We ended up with 10 teams. The draft is now open, click the link on the pool page.  Good luck to everyone!"
809487,Jigger,2013-09-25 23:12:00,1237,I cant even access the league page? No Bettman to be found either?

809489,Jigger,2013-09-25 23:16:00,1237,Im in
809493,Christopheraaron,2013-09-25 23:34:00,3525,"Can't be there as I'm in the car, hopefully you guys will be open to trades"
809503,tb4me,2013-09-26 00:30:00,3295,crap I missed the draft..I just got home from signing my daughter up for skating lessons....I like my goalies but man the only Leaf I got was Cody Fransen..Man my team sucks..My top center is ranked 11th..Booooooo
809514,TDunn,2013-09-26 01:42:00,680,Missed it too because I was fishing lol. Don't mind my team tho!
809522,Stoty,2013-09-26 02:43:00,2910,"Ya, there was only 4 of us for the majority of it, with a 5th joining late. Hopefully those that didn't show had their players pre-ranked and are satisfied with their teams.  If anyone that hasnt been in a Yahoo pool before has any questions please don't hesitate to ask.  Let the trading begin!"
809523,jedimaster,2013-09-26 02:48:00,3472,Spezza for a bag of pucks... any takers?
809524,Stoty,2013-09-26 02:56:00,2910,"Spezza went in the 5th round.... Kadri was one of the last picks, in the 13th round.  "
809525,Stoty,2013-09-26 03:08:00,2910,"For those of you in the pool, I am creating a new thread on the pool page with some important pool info. Goes over Trades, Adding/Dropping, Rosters spots, etc."
809549,leaf4,2013-09-26 12:56:00,2466,"Damn, franson signs a 1 year deal the night after the draft lol"
809605,tb4me,2013-09-26 22:09:00,3295,Ya and I have him.. Thought I got shafted with that pick.. With (gag) bobby ryans game yesterday im becoming more and more happy with my team..bring on week 1..
809606,tb4me,2013-09-26 22:10:00,3295,Hey how did I end up with 3 goalies?
809614,Christopheraaron,2013-09-27 00:02:00,3525,there are 2 active goalies and a bench goalie.
809643,Stoty,2013-09-27 07:06:00,2910,"Exactly Chris. If both ""active"" spots are filled for a particular position any additional players of those positions are automatically put on the bench. You could technically have 6 goalies if you wanted. 2 ""active"" and 4 on the bench. But then you couldn't have any spare of any other position. This is true for every position, as well."
806710,Stoty,2013-09-07 05:51:00,2910,"Since the season is just around the corner and I see that people are already loving the ""Leafs"" thread.... so it got me thinking.  Would any fellow OFC members be interested in a hockey pool? No entry fee, just for fun....  Yahoo! has amazing pools, and I could easily set one up if there's enough interest in it...  Maybe even turn it into a competitive keeper pool that continues year to year?"
806720,fishindevil,2013-09-07 12:30:00,6254,Sure Jamie !!! Do I win if I predict the leafs will NOT win the cup ?? Lol....lol...lets see a template of what you have in mind??
806732,Stoty,2013-09-07 13:59:00,2910,"The most popular format is the ""Head to head"" format.  You go 1-on-1 against another manager each week and you get a ""record"" based on how you do against them in the stat categories on that particular week. (great for bragging rights as well)  Example 7 categories (goals, assists, +/-, ppp, shots, win, shutouts)  Team 1 vs team 2, team 3 vs team 4  Team 1 goes 4-2-1, Team 2 goes 2-4-1 Team 3 goes 5-1-1, Team 4 goes 1-5-1    Pool Standings  Team 3 (5-1-1) Team 1 (4-2-1) Team 2 (2-4-1) Team 4 (1-5-1)  Records just keep adding up each week.  Great pool for active owners. Nice competitive pool where adding/dropping/trading players comes into play and a bad few weeks can kill you.  And obviously the more managers and stat categories, the better."
806747,duxbware,2013-09-07 19:24:00,102,Sounds like fun and a great way to meet some new people. I would love to join.

And of course I'll be available for any questions as well, just shoot me a PM on here or through the pool website."
