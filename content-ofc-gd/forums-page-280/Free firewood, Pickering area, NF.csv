If you've got a chain saw to cut them up then you can have them, take as many as you like. Just PM me on the board for details.  Man, am I ever glad to see those things gone. According to one horticulturalist they are the worst tree to plant anywhere. Exceedingly brittle, they drop twigs and branches constantly, clogging up our rain gutters and littering the lawn, making it difficult to mow without using a wood-chipper for the job. The wife misses the shade, but maybe now I can refurbish my old telescope and do some astronomy from the back deck, it was impossible before because they effectively covered the entire yard."
