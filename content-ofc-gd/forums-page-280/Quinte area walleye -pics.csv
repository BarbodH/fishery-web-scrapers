808862,Pangle,2013-09-22 13:04:00,64,"Hi Thought I would share my quinte trip.  It started by visiting the local tackle shop and speaking with the owner.  Very nice fella who recommended using worm harnesses with huge Colorado blades (1 1/2 - 2 inch wide).  I was a little apprehensive as my go to lure is the earie dearie, anyway we bought 2 of them and some worms.  Sure glad we took his advice as 10 of the 12 walleye we landed came on these harnesses.  Any way we managed our limit and more.  Good times for sure and an awesome feed! Thanks for reading.             "
