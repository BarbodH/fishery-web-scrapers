Here's the tools of the trade     My main destination lake, the trail deteriorated quickly, I thought this is good, not a lot of people getting in, got too nasty with too many blow downs, and I had to turn back    there was more of this than any signs of people    I mentioned to the owner of the local bait store that I had tried to get to this lake, he said ""oh yeah, great brookie fishing eh?"" -I couldn't make it, how did you guys get in? ""we went in from, uh, well, I can't remember""  (I don't blame him at all) ""there's a big grow-op in there too, you could easily get shot or killed sniffing around there, been there for years""  I guess I'll try again in the winter on the sled   damn walleye!    here's my Dad in his element    we used to fish here a lot, 25+ years ago, a lot of great memories, things have changed since then, more pressure and far less angler etiquette  a laker on the spoon    "
