Wonder what year it got drank? LOL  "

809449,Richie Razor,2013-09-25 20:09:00,536,"Coulda been a red stripe or a red cap bottle, which are currently still being brewed in mass quantities."
809453,misfish,2013-09-25 20:32:00,29133," Interesting. Never thought of that. Im a can guy,but only back at home or the camp. Not into littering.  Maybe I should take pics of the timmies cups."

809564,misfish,2013-09-26 15:46:00,29133,"THIS CHINNY WAS ON THE EXPRESS ROUTE  Know here,s a story. LOLI was making a drift,when I noticed the line had gotten in the back of the spool. I quickly start to take the cap off,remove the spool,get the line right,put back the spool,just start putting the screw back on and wham,OH CRAP. Hold the reel and rod with both hands,set the hook,get the screw tighten on and fights on. Big steelie,so I thought.Head shakes,dives to the bottom. 5 minutes later I get a slight look at it. It,s silver,ya big chromer. Another run. Man,powerful fish. Finally get it landed. Double take and it,s a silver chinny. This fish must of been on the express route cuz it looked like it was just out of the lake. Not a mark on it. Have a old fella here that wanted a fish,so I took it home. "
809573,Twocoda,2013-09-26 16:44:00,4130,anyone notice how white the steelies are this year...almost albino looking fish...and exceptionally acrobatic...this has put a new charge in my heart
