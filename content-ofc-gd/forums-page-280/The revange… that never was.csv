Then once we got to the spot where the musky beat up on that smallmouth we had to help a house boat that lost power at just about the worst spot it could have. I was on the engine and my brother was on the rope.    I was hoping our good deed would be rewarded with some musky karma but no such luck.  More bass on top.            Had a small musky follow a spinnerbait and then jump out from under the boat after my brother made his zara dance at the side of the boat but no dice.
