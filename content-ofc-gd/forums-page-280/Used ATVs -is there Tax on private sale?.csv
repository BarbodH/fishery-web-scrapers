809629,Terry,2013-09-27 01:40:00,14456,yes
809649,Fisherman,2013-09-27 10:56:00,7201,"You really don't think the tax man is going to give you a free pass the taxman card.  If they could put a meter onthe toilet bowl, I'm sure the'd tax that too. "
809652,Bernie,2013-09-27 11:40:00,3190,They do. It's called a water meter
809657,FloatnFly,2013-09-27 12:19:00,1640,"yes there is. when you change the ownership, they charge you sales tax.  and they charge you it everytime the vehicle is sold, so say you buy it, pay the tax, turn around and sell it a week later, someone else will have pay sales tax, they sell it a month later, then another person will have to pay sales tax. kinda Bull ifyou ask me.    now, you can negotiate the price down to cover the cost of the sales tax without having to extend your budget"

809807,captpierre,2013-09-28 21:28:00,2521, Importing from the US saves you about $2500 after everything is said and done...  yes but will the manufacturer honour the warranty here
809819,ch312,2013-09-28 22:57:00,1590," yes but will the manufacturer honour the warranty here  It's my understanding that something like IWS warranty services has a better package than factory the extended package and for a lower price too. I've been told they cover imported vehicles, but I couldn't find anything on their website."
