The last 4 nites I spent in a small 2 bedroom cottage rental on the lake out in Eastern Ontario. The weather was cool but the fish were around the first 3 days of the trip. Finding a couple over 4lbs puts a cap on a unreal summer of bassin. Now on with some pictures. We got there late Friday night.  I was working the outside edge right at the beginning of one of the connection channels, prior to the upcoming tree this 4-1/4lb Largemouth came out and smashed the 3.5""TRJ. Only rigged on 1/2oz this time. Needed a slower fall.  After 1 full hour pitching the first ""tap"" on the line what a fight   I went back for a bite to eat after this as I got on the water at 2pm so it was 4pm I ate some food then got out  around 5pm once more, took my mom with me this time. My brother got a few small bass and of course caught the first of the trip haha. First year she's bought a fishing license. She gets a nice largemouth on the wacky worm was excited as hell   At this point I again was pitching the deeper lilly pads for about a hour at this point. I take another pitch and the this big fat largemouth came out at my bait, set the hook and in it was coming. 4.96lbs, hair under the nickel mark.   The next morning I went to a bay and started covering water with a popper working it a mile out over productive areas. Temps were at around 63-68 degrees through the 4 days. Caught a few smaller bass then all of a sudden a  nice one hit, shes quick with photos. I asked her to get the net but right as she takes the pic she got a bite on her worm again   Weighed at 4lbs 9oz so I was excited, I netted my own fish then netted hers as well   Her's was around 3lbs I figured.   Only 2 fish of the morning   Went out cruising some new ground and found a couple smaller bass, here is one of the chunky fish. Slop just wasn't holding the bigger bass, it was a pad thing similar to last September. I just found special areas this past June and August.   3 Bass but all round 2lbs Tried mr frog lot's but no largies came up.   Tried the lower end of a channel way and was working a rock wall with fallen trees every 50ft or so, this bass was 10ft down on a strip of weeds in between a bait of branches. Unreal fight very long fish. Weighed just over 4 1/2lbs   2nd photo, all the bass were healthy this year very fat not skinny like in years before on these waters   Can't have too many rods  Ok 3 of those are not mine   On with the next morning. It was 6:15 just like the last but this time it was windy, not very wavy with maybe a 1ft chop going across the lake but the wind was at least 30-40k I put my popper down and grabbed the Spinnerbait went to the first point I knew. In the past I've lost a big smallmouth or two on tube jigs. Right away I had maybe 4 or 5 casts in and this 3lb range Smallie smashed the bait boatside, there always a treat when I can find them, such hard fighting fish.   Ran around for awhile after that but couldn't get any bass going just Pike. Here is a few pics from that cold start   Drivin to the next spot   Found more small bass later that afternoon in the 2lb and under range after the storm cleared. Pitched cover for a little over a hour with no luck, looked at the vision 110 jerkbait and tried the outside edge of a weedline and got a few this size   Working the bait over 16-22FOW seen a few small Pike and lost 2 baits but here was another fighter   The next day it was foggy out could see 20ft either side of the boat, went straight across the lake and threw the swimbait through the pads for a half hour only had 2hrs to fish before we had to pack up for the road home. Mid 3lb largemouth. Hard fight but it capped of a great summer.   And the Largemouth Bass   Might get out again for a weekend next month for some fishing with my uncle.  Tightlines and thanks for looking  MTBF"
