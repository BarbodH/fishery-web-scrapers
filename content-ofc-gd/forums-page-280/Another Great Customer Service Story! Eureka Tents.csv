Marie, when I was setting up the tent one of the cross member poles snapped on me. It was quite windy that day, one of the ground pegs pulled out while I was clipping the tent to the poles. I had nobody to hold the tent as I was alone.  When I got home I called Eureka and explained to them what happened. They in return shipped me not 1 but 2! replacement poles.. No questions asked! I didn't even have to ship the broken pole in for warranty inspection.]  This is the best tent I've ever owned, never leaks and still looks brand new even after 6 years of use!  Thank you Eureka for the great service!"
