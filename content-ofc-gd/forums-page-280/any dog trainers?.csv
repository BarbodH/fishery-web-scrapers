809414,chickenhawk,2013-09-25 15:53:00,612,Hey guys i just picked up an englush springer pup.  He is only 9 weeks but starts basic obedience classes next week.  I would like to train him to flush rabbits and upland  birds but mostly rabbits as there are more hunting opportunities where i live in southwestern ontario.  My question are there any trainers on this site that would be willing to work with him and myself as i am new to this as well over the wknds during the winter months or does anyone know someone who they could refer me to?  Thanks for any responses i am open to any suggestions guys as to the steps i need to take to make Loomis a great flushing dog.  Thanks guys!

I'd wait until he's closer to a year before you work on advanced training, and that's when an experienced handler can do wonders with you and your dog....I wouldn't pay for training in the first year, you won't see as much return on your investment so to say lol  you need to be consistent, you can see weekly improvement with your dog but then if you take a break from training you'll see just how quickly bad habits can form.....always keep toys separate from training tools, decoys, etc....he'll learn the difference between play time and hunt time, never let him chew on a training bag, or bird, etc"
809478,Big Cliff,2013-09-25 22:36:00,6899,"Very very well written post! I have done a lot of training with bird dogs but this post outlines the basics of training any field dog! Most of my experience is with GSPs which are a versitile field dog so it is a little more complicated but if you follow the advice above you will get good results. I would consider contacting any beagle clubs in your area, they may be able to help you with the tracking aspect of the training."
809495,outllaw,2013-09-25 23:36:00,1232,"for now. keep it fun. most important is teach him the basics. come,heel and such. as he grows. show him where bunnies have sat. show him excitement he will catch on fast. I trialed draathars years back. every sporting dog wants to learn.. one thing you will be doing is shaving him down. bunnies love the rough stuff. please remember after runs check his feet /pads for burrs.. your gonna have a great decade of loyal fun."
809499,wormdunker,2013-09-26 00:16:00,1711,Bare foot wader Very well written.  I have had similar experience with a Golden Retreiver.  Paid for training courses with an experience handler.   My dog was awesome.  Better behaved than people!
