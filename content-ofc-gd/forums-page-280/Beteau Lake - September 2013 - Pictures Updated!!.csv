808155,hutch4113,2013-09-17 15:08:00,374,"Thought I would share some of the pictures from a recent trip to Eddie North - Beteau Lake (last week in fact).  Had an excellent trip (but tiring).  This is my 2nd time going - first time was in the Spring - when the water was high.  This time the Fall - and what a difference. I had in my mind the spots from last time - 99% of which we could not access due to water levels.  It also looked completely different than what I remembered.  The first few days then were hard work - finding new spots/and trying the old ones that produced before (Hello Caribou Bay).  There was also one frustrating day - Tuesday - lost 5 30+ plus that day - 2 of which I am pretty sure were 40+, judging by how they looked.  Some were bad hook sets, some hit right at the boat - and one snapped my line at the leader (bye bye top producing spoon - I hardly used you).I brought a first time fly in person with me on this trip (have to get his pics later).  He caught his first big Pike - 39"" (and maybe more - forgot I had a tape measure).   Here are a couple of pictures:First - my big walleye - 26"""
808156,hutch4113,2013-09-17 15:09:00,374,"Now that looked impressive - until Skudlord came a long.  What was it Skud? - 28""?  "
808157,hutch4113,2013-09-17 15:13:00,374,"The rest for me were pretty much pike.  I was hoping to break my PB from last time - 44 1/4.  I am pretty sure I had one that qualified on Tuesday....and think I had the same one on the hook Friday (repeat after me - hook sets are free - hook sets are free), but the best I could do was 41"".  Here is the 40"" - I like it the best simply because the picture is awesome (not me - the fish).    And the 41""  (It was heavy)  "
808158,hutch4113,2013-09-17 15:14:00,374,"Of course Skud had to chime in again.  Picture it - last cast on the last day, and the plane is on approach.  45""  "
808160,hutch4113,2013-09-17 15:18:00,374,Anyway - have a couple more to post - will do it later.  But thought you would enjoy.  Cannot wait to go back again.
808229,BillM,2013-09-17 21:20:00,17367,Doug always catches the big ones   Nice job fellas!
808295,Moosebunk,2013-09-18 05:42:00,3970,Great show Tupes.  Nice to see Doug into an esox plank too.  Beteau sure coughs 'em up!
808322,adempsey,2013-09-18 13:21:00,1498,Some real beuts from Beteauts!  Looking forward to seeing the rest of 'em.  Thanks for putting them up.
808469,corvette1,2013-09-19 14:18:00,1765,awesome trip nice eyes and gators
808470,Carp,2013-09-19 15:21:00,1488,Those are some really nice fish. Thanks for sharing.
808521,Skud,2013-09-19 23:12:00,739,"I will just add some more of my pics to Adam's thread here. I was up at Eddie's with my son again. He was up with me two years ago and bested everyone with a 43"" pike. He did well again but I got back the trophy with a 45""er and a couple of 28"" walleye. Enjoy  A flurry of pike.             And some decent 'eyes          The rare white sucker that was snagged in the back by a spoon.    Last but not least my two pike that keep me going back.  A heavy 42'er      And my new PB 45"" which Adam already posted.     Being fully satisfied with my success I walked out on the river and hailed a plane which promply flew me back home.     I will be going back up in a few weeks to chase down a Bull moose and catch more trophy pike and walleye."
808605,hutch4113,2013-09-20 16:14:00,374,"Some additions.  Would like to introduce a new person to the fishing forum (no idea if he has signed up yet) - Darrin.  I took him out fishing a few times last year - he hooked into a reasonable size pick in Cooks Bay - but it broke his line - and ever since then he has been one bitter bitter fisherman (I jest).  Anyway - I told him that what he caught in Cooks Bay would be peanuts.  I think you can tell by his expressions that he does agree.      I told him he did not smile enough...this might be over the top:    Have one more to add for him, as his big one it not on here yet."
808608,hutch4113,2013-09-20 16:20:00,374,"Finally - Skud berated me incessantly (well..not really) on posting a horrible picture of my 41"" - and truthfully he was right.  The fish hold is not the greatest, the sun is behind me - what kind of a fisherman does such a thing?  Presenting the new shots - one cleaned up by Skud, and one by myself.  Let the voting being!!  (Disclaimer - these pictures have been cleaned up, but not enhanced  ).  Skud:    Tupelo:  "
808609,hutch4113,2013-09-20 16:23:00,374,Being fully satisfied with my success I walked out on the river and hailed a plane which promply flew me back home.     So it was your fault we had to leave early.  I wondered why the plane came so early.  Next time I am hiding your water shoes.
808622,msp,2013-09-20 17:52:00,1336,Looks awesome guys
808998,Skud,2013-09-23 02:06:00,739,"Here is another pic of my buddy. His biggest pike before this trip was 32"". He landed this beauty 42"". He had a larger pike on a few days later but it snapped his rod and then his line. He will be back up there for another shot at a monster.   "
809035,Gallie,2013-09-23 02:54:00,1215,Nice fishin fellas!
809056,lew,2013-09-23 07:35:00,12766,"Lots of impressive fish on that trip boys, well done !!"
809060,Rich Clemens,2013-09-23 09:50:00,3131,"Man, they sure do grow 'email big up there.  Congrats guys and glad to see you got them figured out."
809348,Fisherpete,2013-09-25 01:59:00,1814,Wow some real beauties! That 42 is FAT... and congrats on getting to the 45 mark - not easy to do.  Pete
809375,solopaddler,2013-09-25 10:00:00,8605,Way to go Adam and Doug! You boys did very well up there.
809513,Skud,2013-09-26 01:34:00,739,Thanks for the comments guys. A shout out to my son who snapped all those great pics of me with my trophies
