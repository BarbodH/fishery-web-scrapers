809758,Burtess,2013-09-28 02:27:00,901,I was looking at the Nat's in Sail today.  VERY light weight and rated -60C.  Like crazy light!!   I realize that they are not at all breathable being a EVA foam shell but they can't be any less breathable than my Titans.  Can anyone comment on the snow and ice traction of the molded EVA sole?  It would seem to me like wearing Crocs on the ice  Burt

Lightweight, warm & bonus is they grip ice & hard packed snow very well - similar to a winter auto tire.  I am very pleased with them.  I'm a little older than most board members & having the added security of good traction is important to me.  -60 rating is stretching the truth.  Having said that I've been on Nippissing at -15 & been comfortable.  Go get a pair.  $90.00 at Ramakko's in Sudbury."
