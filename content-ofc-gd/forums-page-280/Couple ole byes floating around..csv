808924,misfish,2013-09-22 20:11:00,29133,"  After flipp.n for four hours,it took a bit to get the land legs back. Weird feeling.  Nice float a boat bud. Need to work on a anchor for that.  When the water cools,Im sure the bite will get real good. Im not into keeping perch ,that are out of bath water.  Was a real fun morning for sure."

808967,Nipfisher,2013-09-22 23:58:00,2449,  By the way I am considering selling it and will list it in the Classifieds come spring. On kijiji North Bay right now.
809024,Moosebunk,2013-09-23 02:41:00,3970,Like the pics.  Cool set-ups guys.  Will watch the vids in the morn.  Spent the day at Funderland with the kiddies today.  Sick with man cold and sleep deprived from some hotel partiers last night.  I'd have rather had an easier day floating around in a tube jigging up fish.  Better medicine.
809028,danc,2013-09-23 02:46:00,4677,"Nice pics Brian. But for the life of me, I just can't picture myself fishing with a condo in the background. Maybe I'm spoiled."
809075,misfish,2013-09-23 12:23:00,29133,"Dat would be the place Norm.  Dan,I hear ya,but the walking/jogging path is a must."
