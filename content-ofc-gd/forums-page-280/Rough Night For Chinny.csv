Now at this time of year, I'm accustomed to seeing dead fish that are slit from their butts to their chins. And I'm used to seeing a lot of garbage. After all, we're talking about the salmon run, and all the riff-raff that attracts.  But this was just too much ...      Dead chinny, with an empty whiskey bottle and a condom.  What on earth goes on down there at night ???????  "
809438,davey buoy,2013-09-25 19:16:00,5505,"That's just nasty,what more can you say?."
809439,highdrifter,2013-09-25 19:17:00,2534,Me thinks you oughta start hiking away from the river... save yourself the aggravation.
809441,misfish,2013-09-25 19:19:00,29133," Ya I seen some stuff today that pissed me off,but you did answer your own question.   riff-raff"
809442,Roy,2013-09-25 19:21:00,13728,So they're no longer snaggin'?  Just dinner and a few drinks now?
809443,MJL,2013-09-25 19:24:00,2427,"On the brightside, at least it was a safe spawn.LOL"
809445,highdrifter,2013-09-25 19:30:00,2534, Exactly.  Hearing splashes in the river usually sends them out of the wood work.
809447,craigdritchie,2013-09-25 19:34:00,1586,"Safe spawn indeed. Gives a whole new meaning to ""soft plastics.""  Wow."
809450,Richie Razor,2013-09-25 20:12:00,536,"Slit bellies, cheap canadian whiskey, and domers - a sure sign the fall river slaughter is well underway. It's tradition!"
809451,highdrifter,2013-09-25 20:17:00,2534, Nothing like a good romp after a floss sesh!!
809452,Dozer,2013-09-25 20:28:00,896,I look a lot worse waking up with an empty bottle and spent connies by my side.
809457,Rich,2013-09-25 21:05:00,3927,I fear when the level of respect for nature goes down the next bar.
809459,fishindevil,2013-09-25 21:13:00,6254,Pretty disgusting for sure !!! And getting worse everyear ..... It was no different 20yrs ago when I stopped fishing the creeks in the GTA and there is a lot more people now so I'm glad I don't have anything to do with the annual carcass hunt !!! They are way nice in the lake in the summer anyways !!!!! We need more CO'os for sure ....
809479,lurechucker,2013-09-25 22:42:00,28,thats funny i also seen a cigarette in the mouth before i had a picture before but every year is the same the worse come out
809491,Locnar,2013-09-25 23:29:00,645,I'm surprised it spawned at all... Drinkin' all that whiskey n all...
809565,Tim Mills,2013-09-26 15:46:00,476,"Is that 5 star or canadian mist?  I was told that the MNR stopped in at the Bronte Snagfest at the Trestle earlier this week.  Not sure if any charges were "" laid"" ."
809584,Twocoda,2013-09-26 19:19:00,4130,"Whiskey was the marinade and the condon supplied the ""seasoning"" its almost sun dried ...bon appetite"
809598,Fang,2013-09-26 20:49:00,1330,drove up Bronte at 9:30 pm the other night and the Halton Police was turning into the park entrance. Almost wanted to follow along and watch the gong show.  Tried casting the pier the other night too and the overflow from the river must have showed up there. Lined up elbow to elbow on the break wall after that rain. I turned around and went home when I saw the crowd.
809602,misfish,2013-09-26 21:16:00,29133,"Paul,  Want a nice walk and catch a few,and not worry about the ass in heads.  Give a shout.  Then again,Im sure you know where to go with out them."
809616,danc,2013-09-27 00:25:00,4677,"I'm not a big fan of Chinooks being transplanted into the Great Lakes in the first place. Go to the Pacific Ocean if you want to catch one. Kill them all I say. But there's an annual thread on here that says you have to line them, or snag them once the enter the rivers. Not so up here. The locals catch tons of them trolling or hot shotting with big ugly crankbaits every day in the fall. I'm talking about dragging your ugly crankbait upstream so the fish have to attack it. The river fish bite up here. I'm not so sure why they don't down there."
809666,Twocoda,2013-09-27 13:45:00,4130,they do Dan ...but they will shut down the regular diet once they get to their business and only bite out of protection/aggravation to their eggs....
809675,Bearss,2013-09-27 15:52:00,21,Wow looks like Luca Brasi got to that one.
809756,ehg,2013-09-28 02:20:00,2666,  HaHa! That photo about sums up river/trib. salmon fishing in  GTA! lol
809866,Rich,2013-09-29 10:01:00,3927,"Lol, they surely do. Anyone who assumes they dont eat when entering rivers has obviously never thrown a lure in the river for them."
