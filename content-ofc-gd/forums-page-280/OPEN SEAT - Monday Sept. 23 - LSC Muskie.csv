809180,Rizzo,2013-09-23 23:21:00,4754,"Good meeting up with you guys today! Man its a long drive to Kitchener but we're home. We were able to get a few today as well, but nothing huge. Didn't take any pictures, sorry! Water temps were around 63 and there was a pretty big ""slick"" of chocolate milk out from the Thames. All of our fish were caught trolling. Would have liked to cast but my buddy had a surgery not that long ago and the casting was bothering him a bit."
809215,outllaw,2013-09-24 10:34:00,1232,surprised how clean the water is
809302,mistaredone,2013-09-24 21:49:00,913,Thanks to Brian!  I had a good time on the water.  We raised a few fish and although we didn't land any monsters we got into some healthy fish.  I'll be back out this weekend on my boat but we will defiantly G2G again on a Monday this fall.  Steve
808796,SlowPoke,2013-09-21 22:53:00,2984,Leaving from London for Lake St. Clair Monday early and return by mid afternoon. I've got plenty of gear for trolling & casting if needed or bring your own. Weather forecast looks great. 
808804,outllaw,2013-09-21 23:27:00,1232,wish I could brian. but building baits has a priority
808810,Rizzo,2013-09-22 00:20:00,4754,where you going out of? I'm heading that way Monday as well!
808814,SlowPoke,2013-09-22 00:53:00,2984,"Okay George, but let me know anytime you want to do some 'research and development'!  It's too difficult to describe, Roger. Probably easier if I just show you. lol I'll be launching from the Thames River and fishing nearby with water conditions dictating direction. Let's hook up! I have lots of room if you already have a partner."
808821,Rizzo,2013-09-22 02:21:00,4754,Well I have 2 other guys with me...not sure you want 3 people along for the ride! What kind of boat are you in? We will be in a black alumacraft. If you do want 3 guys then let me know!
808823,HTHM,2013-09-22 02:44:00,4082,"Make it two and two, SWMBO said I was not allowed to go."
808825,SlowPoke,2013-09-22 02:57:00,2984,"Possible maybe. I have the room...20'er, lots of seats, 12 rod holders (16 if I brought the downriggers!) but I only have one net. How will we handle the double and triple headers? Actually, with 8 rods in the water we would have to run the big boards and my planer mast is bent. I'll work on it tomorrow and follow up with you on the progress."
808826,SlowPoke,2013-09-22 02:58:00,2984,"I understand SWMBO but what does ""Make it two and two"" mean?"
808827,Rizzo,2013-09-22 03:18:00,4754,well let me know sometime tomorrow if it works if not I will see you there from my boat!
808828,Rizzo,2013-09-22 03:19:00,4754,...and I can bring a net
808833,HTHM,2013-09-22 03:51:00,4082,"Two in each boat, you have three total he has one total, = 4 /2 = 2 people per boat."
808836,SlowPoke,2013-09-22 03:57:00,2984,"Ahhh, boat math. I thought it was a Chuck Woolery reference."
808898,Rizzo,2013-09-22 16:57:00,4754,"One of my guys just cancelled, if you got room for me and one other we'd be happy to join up!"
808910,SlowPoke,2013-09-22 18:37:00,2984,I think someone is coming from Milton. He's read the PM but not confirmed. I'll ask if he's in or out and get back to you.
808911,SlowPoke,2013-09-22 18:38:00,2984,"oh nevermind, he just sent a message lol"
808912,misfish,2013-09-22 18:46:00,29133,"Yer another on my bucket list to fish with,but so far away,and ya want to travel even further.LOL  You heading up this way again Brian?"
808913,SlowPoke,2013-09-22 18:52:00,2984,"Probably not until the water stiffens up a bit lol Hook up with Terry or kickenrob and make a trip down here. I owe Rob a fish, we go skunked and I made him shop at George's discount muskie warehouse last time he was down lol"
808919,Handlebarz,2013-09-22 19:07:00,3790,Well I will look for the report and then maybe get out tomorrow night. Good luck out there guys
808929,Rizzo,2013-09-22 20:36:00,4754,So the other guy is in I guess? If so I will take my boat and hopefully see you on the water! What time are you launching and at what launch? I have never been out that way before so even launch guidance is appreciated.
808932,SlowPoke,2013-09-22 21:01:00,2984,Check your messages
809169,SlowPoke,2013-09-23 22:35:00,2984,"Nice day today. Broke-in a new muskie rod and reel on the third cast. Also nabbed a pike trolling. Both on Handlebarz Double 10 'blazin walleye' Two low 40"" blowups on a red head super spook top water. Both hit and spit.  My fishing partner for the day, 'mistaredone' landed one to chase off the skunk also. Another Handlebarz victim, Double 8 this time.          "
