You can purchase individual lures for $1.99 each...  Purchase everything for $49.99...  Or lifetime for $99.99... With this any lure aditions are free for life....  Downfall I see so far...  Doesn't seem to have lead core chart...  And the snap weight info is devided into 4... So you paying $8 for all the snap weight info..."

809773,fishindevil,2013-09-28 10:41:00,6254,It's about time !!  I have had the books for years and some have been ruined or just get beat up
