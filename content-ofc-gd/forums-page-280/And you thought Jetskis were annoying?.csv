809275,mercman,2013-09-24 18:58:00,7054,Better reinforce my Musky gear. Gonna be a blast catching those on a figure 8
809279,jbailey,2013-09-24 19:17:00,866,thats amazing
809299,misfish,2013-09-24 21:47:00,29133,"Seen this vid a while back. Pretty cool stuff,and the song rocks."
809301,Roy,2013-09-24 21:49:00,13728,Just watch...there'll be a bow season opening for them soon.
809304,Gallie,2013-09-24 21:54:00,1215,I guess rifles open two weeks later than?
809305,Terry,2013-09-24 21:54:00,14456,"they had one on the bay at barrie this  summer,, it was cool"
809307,SirCranksalot,2013-09-24 22:04:00,3291,Don't need to guess where some of us would like to shove those hoses!!~~!
809308,tb4me,2013-09-24 22:12:00,3295,Thats awesome! Where can I test drive one!
809309,bigreddog,2013-09-24 22:15:00,84,Doesn't seem extreme enough. Maybe if they flew at each other at high speed carrying lances or something...?
809310,davey buoy,2013-09-24 22:16:00,5505,Not even a little part of you would want to give that a try??.Looks like fun to me.
809311,Joeytier,2013-09-24 22:20:00,3990,I wonder how many deaths it will take before its outlawed!
809317,i2cool2fool,2013-09-24 23:09:00,349,I wonder how much the future special sticker for your operator card will be worth. LOL  Crazy idea tho.
809322,fishindevil,2013-09-24 23:32:00,6254,"I thought they were like $50,000 ?? The muskokas will probly have a few ..... Lets make sure we have an open season on them as well as no limit !!!!!!"
809335,Rizzo,2013-09-25 00:42:00,4754,someone will lose control and launch themselves down to the bottom of the lake for a serious case of the bends on the way up
809371,fishindevil,2013-09-25 07:53:00,6254,I see some fancy hotel resorts in the Caribbean already have them for tourists !!! Seen them on the travel channel !!!!   Lets hope they outlaw them here. !!!!! Annoying for sure
809382,blaque,2013-09-25 12:08:00,2419," I searched and found a guy is starting it up here in Buffalo on Erie, Lake Erie Flyboard. Book it and let us know if you broke any bones"
809384,Roy,2013-09-25 12:13:00,13728,"Berkley will have flyboard rod holders available in no time. As for the rods, sorry Shimano, the term ""fly rod"" has already been taken."
809404,jimmer,2013-09-25 14:28:00,2730,Just speechless! What next? They would be more impressive if they were stand alone without the jetski.
