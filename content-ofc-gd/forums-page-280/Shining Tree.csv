809053,wormdunker,2013-09-23 07:04:00,1711,"I just returned from the Shining Tree area.  Stayed at 3 Bears camp, accomodations were very nice, fished 5 - 6 hours every day, had a blast!  Caught lottsa walleye, & pike.  There was frost on the ground 3 days in a row!!  The fish were on fire when the weather was the worst, cold & windy conditions seemed to turn them on.  When I went out on a calm morning or evening it was slow.  This area the wallys are small compared to our Lake Erie hogs.  I released alot due to their size.  Best evening was 6 walleye in 2 hours, all were released.  Wednesday afternoon I trailered the boat 42 kms on a gravel road -  all for good reason.  I trolled go getters for only 10 minutes to hook a 14"" walleye, then landed 2 more rather quickly.  Result - 3 walleye in about 20 minutes, largest was 17"".  Then I get a hard hit, I'm thinking a 5 lb walleye.  Nope, I landed a pike approximately 26"" about 7lbs.  Didn't measure it or weigh it, wanted to get it back into the water quickly as possible.  I fought it for about 8 minutes it was tired.  I usually don't target pike & caught it on light walleye gear.  Wifey & I had 3 fish frys, all other fish were released. I have pix on my iphone but don't know how to post them.  Would someone be kind enough to post them if I emailed them your way?  Thanx"
