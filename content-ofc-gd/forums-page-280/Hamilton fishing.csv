809262,Tantiii,2013-09-24 18:06:00,3,"Hey guys I'm a bit new to Hamilton I have fished in orangeville Brampton, Ottawa and multiple areas in Muskoka. I'm a bass fisher I have an Abu Garcia vendetta and a browning baitcaster I want to find nice ponds or little lakes if anyone could help me out? Preferably free"
809611,pidge,2013-09-26 22:40:00,438,"The Grand river is just a tad south of you in Caledonia. I've never fished it, but see people there all the time from shore. Walleye, bass, and pike apparently from the locals. Another one is that conservation area one just a tad closer to you....oh the name eludes me right now, but it's between the Grand and you. Binbrook. That's what it is. Check there. I'm not from the hammer, but due to work I see a lot of neat water crossings."
809645,Rich,2013-09-27 09:29:00,3927,"Check out the conservation areas on the northwest side of Hamilton, namely Valens and Mountsberg as well as the other great suggestions. They aren't free but still very reasonable priced for a day of fishing."
809672,Tantiii,2013-09-27 15:33:00,3,sounds good and you know any which have boat rentals? preferably electric motor?

809786,hotsky,2013-09-28 15:22:00,400,Binbrook has jon boats for rent but they are closed after Thanksgiving. No trolling motors but I usualy bring mine and use it. Actually going today since it's proably going to be th last time I can do it this year. They reopen May 1.
809868,Rich,2013-09-29 10:09:00,3927,"I believe conservation areas across the board mostly close thanksgiving, so get out there! I THINK valens had boat rentals last time I was there. Definitely not mountsberg."
