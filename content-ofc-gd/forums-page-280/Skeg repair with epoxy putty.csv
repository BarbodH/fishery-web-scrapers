808829,captpierre,2013-09-22 03:28:00,2521,"A rock took a bite out of the back of my 115 hp  skeg.  About 2""x2"" area.  Fixed it with epoxy putty.  Used hack saw and sander to shape it just right.  Been on for a couple weeks.  So far so good.  Will it last?"
808832,HTHM,2013-09-22 03:50:00,4082,Probably not the whole season. Look into getting it welded up when you do your impeller this fall.
808834,SlowPoke,2013-09-22 03:52:00,2984,I'd agree. The vibration will likely shake it loose. Skeg repairs aren't horribly expensive or you can also instal a skeg guard. http://www.basspro.com/SkegShield-Skeg-Guard/product/10200068/
808844,Big Cliff,2013-09-22 11:28:00,6899,can't say if it will last but what I want to know is where did you hit the rock?
808920,captpierre,2013-09-22 19:09:00,2521," it's like a bite was taken out the back of the bottom,.-circular chunk gone  also clipped the tip of one prop blade"
808993,DRIFTER_016,2013-09-23 01:52:00,10439,Did the same thing this summer here in YK. Even with the high cost of things up here the repair only cost me $250. Well worth the cost. Call Citywide Welding in Mississauga and see what they want for the repair.
809065,Big Cliff,2013-09-23 10:55:00,6899,"No, what I meant was where were you fishing when you hit the rock? I have only hit one in Sturgeon Lake in 12 years and that was just off Sturgeon Point when I tried to go between the red marker and the shore."
809167,SlowPoke,2013-09-23 22:17:00,2984,"He was in the boat, Cliff.... Geeesh!"
809191,captpierre,2013-09-24 01:14:00,2521,too close to the point coming out of Big Bald channel into Little Bald
809205,wormdunker,2013-09-24 08:36:00,1711,I've had great service at Kawartha prop repair in Buckhorn.
809208,Big Cliff,2013-09-24 09:45:00,6899,X2 on that one. Excellent service and workmanship!
809252,captpierre,2013-09-24 16:26:00,2521,"I dropped in to them with a photo.  said they'ld have to get a mechanic to break her down.  would be nice if they could weld a piece on without disassembling the lower unit on the trailer  welding a 2""x2"" piece at the bottom  could wreck the seals in the lower unit, I guess."
809278,DRIFTER_016,2013-09-24 19:12:00,10439,"I had the skeg repaired on mine this summer. It had a similar issue. They actually cut it off about 2/3's of the way up where the metal is thicker and you get a better, stronger welding job. They did not have to remove the lower unit to do this. Talk to Citywide and see what they have to say."
809283,buick14,2013-09-24 19:31:00,741,Just leave it....it will fall off and who cares....  2x2 area on a 115 no biggie.  Ive done it and seen it done all rhe time without any noticeable differences
809296,aplumma,2013-09-24 21:00:00,6896,Shielding paste can be used often to keep you from disassembling the bottom end. A machine shop would be a better option than a boat repair shop they specialize in metal and will have the correct equipment and talent to make you happy.   Art
809580,Fish4Eyes,2013-09-26 17:46:00,1022," Yep, the heat from welding will melt them was what I was told."
