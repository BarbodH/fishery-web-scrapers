809159,LefroyFisherman,2013-09-23 21:21:00,602,"Hey guys,  I was just wondering if any of you have used or are currently using the Iron Blaster from Water Depot? I live just south of Barrie and the water here is super hard and has a lot of sulpher, I am thinking about getting the Iron Blaster. To rent they are about 56 bucks a month or 2600 outright."

809164,LefroyFisherman,2013-09-23 21:52:00,602,"I know it's hard water with lots of iron and sulpher, was just wondering if anyone had an experience with the Iron Blaster model and/or from Water Depot"

809204,wormdunker,2013-09-24 08:29:00,1711,"Not sure if this helps.  I have a Kinetico water softener, works great.  Lottsa soap bubbles while showering.  I live in Fonthill, town water has iron in it.  Also - if high concentrations of iron in your water it will wear out your plumbing fittings, taps, & toilets prematurely."
809228,Sinker,2013-09-24 13:12:00,8692,"I""m not sure about the iron blaster, but do you have a water softener?  Like aplumma said, a water chemistry analysis would help.  S."
809240,SirCranksalot,2013-09-24 15:13:00,3291,"A softener will take out quite a bit of iron as well, but not sulphur. We had a guy from Barrie install ours and it was a lot cheaper than Water Depot. We just got a mechanical timer (similar to a light timer) to control the backwash timing. It's the fancy computer that Depot and others use that costs a lot of $$. A bit of overkill for most households, IMO. If interested PM me and I'll dig out the guy's name."
809316,LefroyFisherman,2013-09-24 22:56:00,602,"I've got a water softener, but it doesn't cut it, water is too hard. Thanks for the help guys, I think I don't really have a choice if I want to get rid of the iron and the sulpher smell, also have a little baby boy coming in two months aswell !"
