809788,Cosmos,2013-09-28 16:46:00,588,I used to fished that lake during spring time for last 3 years. Always had a great success for pike. During summer time traffic on the lake is too heavy. Bass is also in this lake in good numbers. I caught only 1 small walleye long time ago.
809792,F_ast,2013-09-28 17:26:00,154,Sparrow once upon a time was a great fishing lake.  Im sure it still is at times.  We have caught monster pike and muskie out of Sparrow.  The walleye population seemed to dwindle but largemouth and smallmouth are abundant.
