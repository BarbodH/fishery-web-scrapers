808734,JoshS,2013-09-21 17:12:00,729," I've never used a calcutta TE for musky.... How does it compare to the calcutta D for casting big blades? I find the calcutta D workable but trying to burn them all day is tough... I almost prefer using my abu C3 with the power handle but demoted that to my trolling rod.  The calcutta D fits good in the hand, very nice reel."
808741,kickingfrog,2013-09-21 17:32:00,8333,Another way to get a bit more bang for your buck is to mark your braided line in 10 foot increments and any casting reel becomes a double threat as a trolling reel that allows you to repeat settings on your trolls.
808757,Dan668,2013-09-21 19:18:00,1120,"I like my 401D, used it the past weekend. Ive heard that the 300 sized gears will make it a bit better with blades."
808886,Fisherpete,2013-09-22 15:41:00,1814,"The Calcutta TE with power handle makes pulling in 10's and even 13's very easy. Much easier than with the D. The D is very smooth and casts a mile, and is OK for blades, but not the best. The Abu winch is in the same class as the TE for blades as well.  Pete"
809094,mercman,2013-09-23 14:47:00,7054,"Well I may only get out for them once or twice a year Lew. But like you say, they will be with me for life, and I always wanted to own them."
809124,mepps,2013-09-23 18:06:00,1301,"I just picked up a Curado 301 this year and I absolutely love it! I think I paid around $250 in July. I've also got a Calcutta 251 that I picked up back in 2004 and was on light musky duty and its still in great shape (I mainly use it for bass and pike now). You cant go wrong with a larger used one that should fall in your price range.  As for the Quantum Cabo, I have mixed feelings about mine. I love the look and feel of the reel, but it didnt stand up well to the stress of casting musky lures. The main gear cracked, and since Quantum/Zebco dont make the part I need anymore it just sits on my shelf collecting dust. I'd grab another, but wouldnt pay must over $100 personally - and I wouldn't cast any heavy baits with it.  theres the crack...   Then it fell into peices after pulling the reel apart.  "
809125,Rich,2013-09-23 18:13:00,3927,"BPS Musky Angler reel.. i fish muskies once every two years, works just fine for that. Lol"
809128,kickingfrog,2013-09-23 18:21:00,8333, I've wonder about them as a loaner if I've got someone with me who can't reel my lefthand reels.
809129,Rich,2013-09-23 18:23:00,3927,"Honestly, I have no complaints about the reel. It has done the job just fine for me and after trolling for pike with it, and occasional musky fishing over 5 years it performs just as well as my Shimano Cardiff (albeit I've used it a LOT more)."
808343,jeffw,2013-09-18 16:18:00,267,I second the lexa 300 i bought my last year and have no complaints. Caught alot of skies and pike with no problems. Cheers jeff
808344,2 tone z71,2013-09-18 16:21:00,1311,"I use a Calcutta and Tekota,, and if the Muskies don't start being friendly you can have them cheap lol"
808354,mattyk,2013-09-18 17:10:00,2110,Calcutta TE for the big stuff and Curado 300 for the small baits.
808359,Squid,2013-09-18 17:39:00,1656,"Don't fall for the advice where you need reels for specific applications like cow girls or whatever. A good solid reel that will do it all is what you are looking for. Like dax mentioned, Diawa Luna 300 or the revo toro. No need to go and get a calcutta 400 TE, it really is a waste of money when you can buy two really good reels for the price. I have one and am happy with it but I can't see/feel the performance difference that 300 bucks make."
808360,Squid,2013-09-18 17:40:00,1656,Perfect example of why not to buy the most expensive one. Mid range is fine we are not catching 80 lb fish here.
808369,adempsey,2013-09-18 18:15:00,1498,"Abu Garcia 6500 C3.  I only musky fish a few times a year though.  I would have picked up a used Calcutta, but couldn't find a good enough deal on one.  Regardless, I love the Abu and it's weight is a non-issue for me.  I ain't no wimp!! Lol."
808373,BucktownAngler,2013-09-18 18:24:00,582," its not for the fish, its for the baits."
808377,Squid,2013-09-18 19:18:00,1656,So some foks think that expensive reels cast big musky baits better than cheaper ones? Really? Its not the bait or the fish its the person holding the equipment.
808378,Squid,2013-09-18 19:20:00,1656,carbon fibre brakes will increase your reel performance substantially from the original ones installed in your reels. I plan on giving all my reels to a musky inc member after the season and he will clean the reels for 10 bucks each and then add top of the line disks into my reels which will greatly improve their life and performance.
808380,mercman,2013-09-18 19:33:00,7054,"Shimano Calcutta D for casting, Tekota for trolling. For me its over kill, but I wanted them, and I bought them with cigarette money I saved since I quit"
808385,BucktownAngler,2013-09-18 19:41:00,582," not only do they cast better, they hold up better to the abuse of reeling in big baits.  the lexa 300 has a plastic bushing for the pinion gear, unlikely to hold up a long time"
808387,lew,2013-09-18 20:00:00,12766,"I use both Calcutta CT's & TE's and in my opinion, the TE is FAR superior to the CT.  For cranking big bladed baits or or working large jerkbaits, I like the Abu 7000's and for trolling the Tekota 600LC is my reel of choice.  Everybody has their own opinions on reels and that's the way it should be."
808391,Richie Razor,2013-09-18 20:33:00,536," No issue with my reel after some good fishing time with it. I believe the Lexa 300 also has 22lbs of drag, plenty for fighting skis. Read many of the reviews online and no one has had an issue with this. It's a solid reel and I was glad I bought this over a more expensive option."
808393,JoshS,2013-09-18 20:41:00,729,"My friend had a cheaper shimano Cardiff, he only got a few seasons out of it before it died and had to buy another reel... he got a calcutta D and will most likely have it for a very long time. Worth the money.  I use a calcutta D (they don't make the TE's anymore) for most of my fishing. I have a curado 300 too but pretty much use the calcutta most of the time, just feels more solid, even with the smaller baits.  I also have an Abu C3 that I've beat up for 5 years and it still works great. That's a good strong cheap reel IMO. I've put a lot of hours on mine and it's really easy to service yourself if needed. Think it's around the $120 mark."
808395,lew,2013-09-18 20:53:00,12766, Why is buying quality gear overkill Paul ??  Much better than buying cheap stuff and replacing it every 2 years.
808436,Raf,2013-09-19 01:31:00,3495," yep.  i can see Pete's (squid) point about a good all-round reel for someone looking to outfit a combo or two and that's just fine  but once you start obsessing over these stupid fish, i do think reels specific to a task can become advantageous - mainly in terms of durability of gear and angler.  i tried an avet salt water reel strictly for dbl 10s & 12s this year  -- makes it a lot easier to throw them all day and work the lures fast.  my 7001 is good for big blades and it can do much more but for this purpose the avet's much better.  along the same lines, i find using a curado 301 so much easier throwing suicks and other jerkbaits.  i am not talking about carrying a whole arsenal of rods in the boat either.  I typically have 2-3 casting outfits in the boat plus a trolling rod.  Depending on the where and when, the starting lineup changes.   In the fall, i may only bring one or two casters and 2 trolling combos, one wire and another braid."
808441,muskymatt,2013-09-19 02:10:00,2608,"Lots of good comments, some questionable ones as well. A more expensive reel has some qualities others can't touch, period.  If you spend the money you will get a reel that; If you are a seriously addicted caster who throws heavy bucktails and big glide baits all day every day, you will want to spend the money on a high quality reel. On the other hand if you only get out a dozen times a year, cast 40% of the time and are not into heavy baits, and troll the rest of the time, then a less expensive reel might fit the bill. Personally, I wore out an abu 6500 in a single season. I now own 2 Curado 300E reels and have had them for about 4-5 years now. They are in fantastic shape and have caught a ton of fish on hundreds of thousands of cast(Estimate  ). Get what fits your needs and you can build from there"
808456,lew,2013-09-19 12:18:00,12766," My daughter uses a 300E for muskies and is very happy with it, specially with the low profile making it easier for her to hold."
808459,muskymatt,2013-09-19 12:43:00,2608," Yes they are easy to palm and very comfortable,  when you are working and burning the baits in this reel won't wear you out just holding on to it.I see a lot of guys out here using the 300dsv, 300e, revo  and now guys are spending the crazy bucks on the tranx. That said, a lot of 50-50 cast/trollers are still using the abu 6500/5500 series. Shopping around f or a discounted second hand reel is also a good option."
808464,Sinker,2013-09-19 13:59:00,8692,"I've been using a couple abu's (5500, and 6500)for more years than I care to mention. No issues yet. I fish for everything though, not just musky. I only use the abu's for musky. One of them I bought used to boot.  S."
808478,fishnsled,2013-09-19 17:03:00,3520,"x2  The ABU's have been a very good reel for me as well, trolling or casting for close to....I better not say either...lol!   With only one reel that gave me some grief out of the 5 or 6 I have in all that time.  They have seen a lot of use over the years, I'd say they are pretty tough to beat for the price.  Not sure if they are built as well now a days but the ones I have are tanks."
808589,Fisherpete,2013-09-20 13:31:00,1814,I use a Tekota 500 for trolling Calcutta D for all around - and is ok for blades Curado 300 EJ for surface baits or anything that requires fast line pickup Calcutta TE for blades - can pull twin 13's all day with no problem  I have used cheaper reels like the Abu C3's and they are ok - if you just fish muskies a day here and there. But if you fish them hardcore (ie 8 straight days on LOTW) you and your arms/wrists will appreciate a Calcutta TE or Abu Winch. If you have the budget get the good stuff - resale value on these items are solid as well.  Pete
808591,kickingfrog,2013-09-20 13:53:00,8333,"Well my most recent musky was on a 1000 Stratic but I would not recommend that as a first choice.  I have calcuttas, TEs and Bull. I also have a curado 300 dsv. And a big old 700 Abu. I've long been a shimano guy but I have tried, and will try, others as well. After what shimano did to the TEs and the curados I'm just afraid that they'll also wreck the Bull and that will be just about the end on the line."
808646,Handlebarz,2013-09-20 20:46:00,3790,Sorry missed this thread somehow I just sold a revo toro winch 60 for $225. Keep your eye open great deals come up all the time.  If you can handle a large reel I love the white Abu 7000 I still have mine for a backup and got it from the USA a couple years back for $149
808684,Gregoire,2013-09-21 01:28:00,1397,"If you are looking under 200 and want to get one now I would recommend the Daiwa Lexa. As others have said the better reels are worth it, but only really worth the money if you fish them hard, as Pete said. If you are willing to wait the Lexa 400 looks like a really nice reel, and as a lefty I have a soft spot for them. Another option would be a calcutta b 400 if you can find one kicking around."
808218,Sour_Squirrel,2013-09-17 20:37:00,196,"I'm looking for a decent reel for my Muskie rod.   I have a budget of approx $200. What are some suggestions of which reel I can buy.   The Revo Toro, Calcutta are nice but out if my price range.  I also don't really like the bulk of the round Abu reels like the C6500. I was thinking a Daiwa Lexa 300. Does anyone own or have any first hand experience with one?"
808221,davey buoy,2013-09-17 20:46:00,5505,"I've only seen the round reels used for musky, Gear ratio I presume. Will be good to hear from the experts!.Good luck."
808222,Believer,2013-09-17 20:57:00,40,"A little bit over what you are looking to spend but i've been using a Daiwa Luna this year and absolutely love it. $269 from Cabellas. I havent used the lexa but i think Daiwa gets a worse reputation than it deserves over the past few years, lexa might be a little light from the looks of it for dbl 10's if thats what you were thinking.  http://www.cabelas.ca/product/29559/daiwa-team-daiwa-luna-baitcast-reels"
808224,leaf4,2013-09-17 21:04:00,2466,"for what you want to spend the revo toro winch is in the area of that, 229 retail at bills bait. the revo Toros ratio is too high and will give you a workout on a day of retrieving big lures look for something in the 4:6:1 area but it all depends on your needs some go into the area of 5:3:1 and some go down to 4:1:1 so there's a lot of variance"
808225,Richie Razor,2013-09-17 21:04:00,536,"I've used the Lexa 300 this year a few times, and can say it's a great reel for the price!!! Next year however, Diawa is coming out with a 400 series version, similar in size to the Shimano Tranx but half the price. The Lexa 300 is made in Korea, and I must say the quality is pretty decent...."
808233,scugpg,2013-09-17 21:46:00,1373, I prefer the low profile bait caster over a round reel.  I just got a Toro nacl and really like it.  The toro winch is also great but depends what you are using it for. pro tackle in Belleville should have both and has free shipping!  Sorry just noticed your budget what about a curado 300?
808238,leaf4,2013-09-17 22:10:00,2466,"yeah sorry the revo toro winch, I didn't realize there was a difference lol but yeah excellent reel for the price"
808239,bigbuck,2013-09-17 22:12:00,2449,"Depends on what you are going to use it for. Double 10s/Cowgirls are damned big and need a low gear ratio. Big jerkbaits/glidebaits not so much. Smaller spinnerbaits such as slopmasters, you can get away with a flippin stick with a good low profile reel. I really like my record 65 from abu, the winch is a great feel in your price range. Save up another week or two. Buy a good reel, you will have it for years and years."
808240,landry,2013-09-17 22:13:00,1005,The curado is a great overall choice. Revo winch is good for big blades but it will be hard to fish with speed. It's kind of a specialty reel. On the cheap side the cardiffs  are affordable and I have had three that have all been durable. Abu C reels do not last long. I have the revo toro and it is a great all around reel. Good for big plastic and everything but big #10 blades. But it will do that in a pinch too.
808244,Pigeontroller,2013-09-17 22:25:00,2793,I second the Diawa Luna 300. Best (all around) reel you can buy for the money.
808248,BucktownAngler,2013-09-17 22:31:00,582,what do you plan on throwing with it?
808257,Weeds,2013-09-18 00:03:00,782,"You a lefty or a righty? A real good reel for the money, although no longer the flavour of the month are the Quantum Cabos. You can still get em brand new on Ebay for as little as 100 bucks sometimes. I got mine without the clicker for 80 if I remember correctly. Durable, smooth, semi low profile.  Heres one. http://www.ebay.com/itm/NIB-Quantum-Cabo-CBC31PTs-Left-Handed-Baitcast-Reel-WideSpool-Baitcast-/380716265861?pt=LH_DefaultDomain_0&hash=item58a4753185  Just an example.

808263,Gallie,2013-09-18 00:39:00,1215,If you want a good quality reel on a budget have you considered kijiji or craigslist? I wouldnt trade my shimano calcutta te for ANYTHING. I saw one on kijiji for 250 after i bought mine for 410 plus tax at jbs warehouse. Good luck P.s.the wife was not pleased with my purchase but it is still worth every penny
808264,Raf,2013-09-18 00:42:00,3495,"the calcutta 400 series is propably the best all - round reel.  i know you said its out of your budget but, the seasons coming to an end and you may as well save your pennies and / or beg grovel for christmas.  if not, then reconsider a abu 6500 or 7000 series or look for a used calcutta.  you are not gonna find a low profile reel that can do it all, they are all a compromise of sorts.  i dont own a calcutta btw, i have different reels for different baits / rods / purposes."

I'm just a rookie for targeting Muskies.   I have a few Grandmas, Swim Whizz, Suicks and a few Musky Killers. Right now I have a medium action 7'9"" G Loomis Muskie rod. I've checked Kijiji and have seen a few Abu Revo Toro 60's for around the $200 price range.  I'm seriously considering that option. I have a Abu Revo Winch 50 that I use for Bass on my crankbait rod.   It's a sturdy bullet-proof reel that casts and retrieves smooth so I'm sure the Revo Toro is of the same quality. The Revo Toro has a ratio of 5.4:1 and the Revo Winch is 4.6:1.  So it's a good compromise between speed and cranking power.  I don't know how all you married guys explain your fishing purchases to your wives.....??"
808278,Raf,2013-09-18 02:36:00,3495,best advice i was given  get all your gear & boat *BEFORE* you get married.
