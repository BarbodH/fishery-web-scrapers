808852,Rich,2013-09-22 12:29:00,3927,"For 12v batteries (ie trolling motor batteries) on sale at CTC this week for $9.99, just a heads up ! I know battery life is an issue for me as I only run electric motors now so this little panel will be handy dandy."
808855,Gerry,2013-09-22 12:49:00,257,"Not likely.....perhaps to charge a cell phone battery.....and that's if you have direct sunlight for a week. For a 12 V lead acid, deep cycle battery you'll need 2,  2' x 4' premium panels (not those at Can Tire). This will give you approx. 150 watts and it will still take a week of quality sunlight to charge your battery from half level."
808864,lookinforwalleye,2013-09-22 13:21:00,4399,"Pretty much useless like gerry said perhaps a cell battery, and as far as being weather proof the one I had was hardly weather proof, not even sure what that is."
808896,Bernie,2013-09-22 16:55:00,3190,"They are good for keeping a battery topped up in a vehicle that sits for long periods, but to charge one it will be useless."
808909,davey buoy,2013-09-22 18:08:00,5505,It worked well in my 40hp runabout I had.With no alternator and/or electronics.Sitting in the driveway during the week was more than long enough to keep the boat starting from May-Oct.Never had to put the battery on charge throughout the fishing season. Remember it's $9.99 for the charger.But $29.99 for the controller.
808941,woodenboater,2013-09-22 22:42:00,2277,I think the key thing for solar panels is the amperage they put out. Most are maintainers but 1-3 amps would be fine by me for topping up a battery...
808961,Rich,2013-09-22 23:39:00,3927,It puts out 2.5 amps ... My charger trickle charges with 2amps and fully charges my spiral cell in 9 hours from dead. Should work fine.
808962,lookinforwalleye,2013-09-22 23:44:00,4399,"Perhaps  if you live near the equator, not likely to get any where near that output here."
808963,Terry,2013-09-22 23:44:00,14456,"I can't find it , but no way it puts out 2.5 amps for 10 bucks  if it was 12 watts at 12 volts it would be one amp   found it Coleman 2.5W Solar Battery Maintainer thats watts not amps"
808969,lookinforwalleye,2013-09-23 00:06:00,4399,Put a voltmeter on it when the sun is out and if you get 2.5 amps I'll buy you a beer.
808972,Richie Razor,2013-09-23 00:13:00,536,Lol there is no way this solar charger will be of any benifit when charging a 12v. Did you mean it'll charge a single A battery? Cause that's all it's good for.
808978,Nipfisher,2013-09-23 00:42:00,2449,It is better then nothing. No alternator on my 90hp Yam and the maintainer helps.
808983,sofabed,2013-09-23 01:05:00,119,I have a 24V electric motor on my boat. I bought 2-40W coleman solar panels this year since I do not have power by my boat dock. They would keep the batteries topped up to about 12.7V  as long as there was a lot of sunlight and I charged the batteries for about 6 hours a day and used them for about 4 hours. I ended up using my generator must of the time to charge the batteries I found the panels were a waste of time.
808985,glen,2013-09-23 01:32:00,2641,Thanks for the heads up rich.  I have two connected to my boat all the time it's in the garage.  Keeps the batteries topped up when not used for a while.
809061,Rich,2013-09-23 10:05:00,3927,"Man people have to argue adding a $10 solar panel to your boat.. like really? It produces power, it helps more than nothing."
809067,Fisherman,2013-09-23 11:21:00,7201,"2.5 watts at 12v is like trying to fill an empty 100 litre tank with 10 litres, some people just don't understand."
809102,Terry,2013-09-23 15:57:00,14456,"me,  not arguing however I do correct bad info and give facts as needed"
809107,Rich,2013-09-23 16:23:00,3927,10 litres would get you home. I speak common sense.
809127,Rich,2013-09-23 18:21:00,3927,How about use it for your phone then.. fish finder.. aqua vu... Whatever needs power will appreciate it.
809144,davey buoy,2013-09-23 19:35:00,5505,"Can't argue that back in the day ,it kept my 40hp starting for at least 5mths.Enough power or not.It did the job for 3 years."
809145,Terry,2013-09-23 19:45:00,14456,"hey without a doubt they would be better then nothing, but based on the watts it would take 400 hours of sunlight to charge a battery under perfect conditions"
809148,Richie Razor,2013-09-23 19:57:00,536,I guess the consensus is to save your $10.
809184,Ksword,2013-09-23 23:35:00,40,"These low wattage (Small)panels are ok for keeping batteries topped up during storage, but they will never charge a battery.."
