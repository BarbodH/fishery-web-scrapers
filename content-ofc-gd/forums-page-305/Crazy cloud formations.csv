789985,Terry,2013-06-02 16:39:00,14456,didnt see that but goes from bright sun shine to rain and back again every few minutes
789986,Luke V.,2013-06-02 17:01:00,286,Yes! Very Erie. Over lake O it looks like she's gunna pour This is what I faced two miles from shore on Friday evening.  Was not a fun ride back 
789988,davey buoy,2013-06-02 17:19:00,5505,That's pretty scarey stuff!!!!!
789990,Luke V.,2013-06-02 17:27:00,286,For really choppy very fast 1 footers to 3 foot swells in 5 minutes  Here's a couple more pics      
790000,Raf,2013-06-02 19:04:00,3495,we saw a tornado touch down on our way home from tobermory yesterday.. between mt. forest & arthur along hwy 6.
790018,Old Ironmaker,2013-06-02 20:34:00,8243,A small twister touched down on Argyll St. in Caledonia Friday at 5PM in front of my wifes car. Right around then the wind blew up on the lakeshore from dead calm to batten down the hatches in mere seconds.  I have worked on the docks in Hamilton and been here on Erie for years and have seen some strange weather and cloud formations like never before. Then you see all the havoc this spring has brought in the US. Records are being broken everyday.  Armageddon? Sure is scary.
790023,Nipfisher,2013-06-02 20:54:00,2449,We had about 4-5 different fronts blow through this morning. Nipissing had huge whitecaps on it and the water is up 6 inches from last week.
790027,lew,2013-06-02 21:07:00,12766, I was up at the West Arm a month ago and the water was up probably 8-10 inches or so and just above the docks. I'm heading back up in 3 weeks so I sure hope it goes down somewhere around normal by then.  How much above normal do you think it is now Nipfisher ??
790038,Handlebarz,2013-06-02 22:28:00,3790,Raf I saw a video of it today it's 8 min long but still was cool to watch.  http://m.youtube.com/#/watch?v=HsG-Pe4nfMk&a=&feature=youtu.be&desktop_uri=%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DHsG-Pe4nfMk%26feature%3Dyoutu.be%26a
790043,Jigger,2013-06-02 23:04:00,1237,"Was looking for some info for a trip next weekend, lew. Came across this page.  http://www.tpsgc-pwgsc.gc.ca/ontario/eaux-water/renseignement-information-eng.html"
790053,Raf,2013-06-02 23:50:00,3495," yup, that's pretty much what we saw from a different angle.  having never seen one before, there was a bit of a 'no, that can't be' moment at first but we could see it form then dissipate.  it was odd because we were under that cell -- there was no lightning or heavy rain at all, just light showers."
790108,lew,2013-06-03 08:17:00,12766," Thanks Jigger, that's what I was looking for."
790354,jammer,2013-06-04 13:53:00,43,Surprised the weather didn't get worse then it was on the weekend with the way the sky looked...  Just the odd scattered shower...
790355,jammer,2013-06-04 13:54:00,43,I have no idea why my response is underlined...  :/
