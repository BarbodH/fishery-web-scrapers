789618,Rizzo,2013-05-31 20:22:00,4754,holy smokes pulled down the pole and everything...I miss Barrie for goofy stuff like this. Now I live in Breslau where the Millard hanger is
789627,wkimwes,2013-05-31 20:43:00,76,Ha ouch that is a big bill.
789633,Rod Caster,2013-05-31 21:07:00,5784,Should have known to take the mast down while transporting it
789635,fishindevil,2013-05-31 21:14:00,6254,"Even when I read the thread I thought it must be a guy towing a sailboat !!!! It happens quite a bit actually they are famous for hitting bridges as well !!! Ya and I bet he gets a nice bill for that as a pole is about $3,000 not to mention the wires the road closed for a day or so !!!!!! It's not gonna be one of his better days that's for sure !!! Lol"
789656,Fisherman,2013-05-31 22:24:00,7201,"And these blowbaggers are supposed to be good sailors, hate to see that nitwit in the water."
789657,Rich,2013-05-31 22:29:00,3927,Haaaaaaaa!
789659,misfish,2013-05-31 22:43:00,29133,"Towing with mast up,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,DARWIN."
789662,Terry,2013-05-31 23:07:00,14456,but it would save him time once he's at the ramp to already have it up...darn low power lines.....lol
789676,BillM,2013-06-01 00:04:00,17367,He's towing that thing with an Expedition?  LOL!!!!!
789721,Joey,2013-06-01 02:57:00,9122,DOH!!!
789731,Moosebunk,2013-06-01 03:23:00,3970,Whole incident reeks of stupidity. lol.
789733,kickingfrog,2013-06-01 03:29:00,8333,I wonder if he forgot to factor that his mast was riding on top of 15 odd feet of boat?
789873,FloatnFly,2013-06-01 23:09:00,1640,"  if that were a chev, he;d be stuck where he hooked up the trailer!   built ford tough!"
789874,BillM,2013-06-01 23:12:00,17367, Now that's even funnier!  LOL!
789881,kickingfrog,2013-06-02 00:01:00,8333,Not the brand of vehicle so much as the class.
789882,BillM,2013-06-02 00:02:00,17367," Yeah, my original remark wasn't about it being a Ford so much as being the wrong tow vehicle for that boat."
789889,FloatnFly,2013-06-02 00:36:00,1640,"  not really, the expedition is built on an f-150 frame, and was the replacement for the ford bronco.  just because its called an suv, doesn't make it an suv, its basically a 1/2 ton pick up without a bed"
789890,BillM,2013-06-02 00:37:00,17367, I wouldn't be towing that with a F150 either.
789918,FloatnFly,2013-06-02 04:52:00,1640,"  why not? its really not that large of a boat, just sits really tall, especially if you forget to remove the mast lol"
790055,bare foot wader,2013-06-03 00:14:00,1354,FloatnFly - I bet you won't forget the mast next time!  just kidding lol
790105,FloatnFly,2013-06-03 04:39:00,1640,"  haha, wouldn`t catch me on a wind yacht, i`ll take a nice searay instead"
790130,oldphart,2013-06-03 12:48:00,665,"~~~~ Years ago waiting at the Ramp at the Glades, some twit was pharting around with his sailboat, trying to get it just right on the trailer, finally he has got it and away he goes. Then eveyone one started for him to stop, he forgot his mast was still up, and had just snagged the power lines crossing the road. Luckly he stopped in time"
