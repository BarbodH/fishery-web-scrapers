790060,Rich,2013-06-03 00:31:00,3927,"50k winds? Oh no problem we'll just go to a smaller pond. Ha. Right.  Battled insane wind, and luckily very little rain, 8 hrs today casting for pike. Threw the anchor down and knew we were in for a day when all it did was slow us down enough to fish. Every 5 min we were into fish though... oos bass. Wherever we went, whatever we did to avoid them. There they were. Small pond disadvantage.  The winds didn't let up, but at about 4 pm they changed direction. Things got exciting, the bass were gone, and the pike were hungry! Well. Agressive. Add in the ultimate frustration. As we're drifting shore to shore in 20 min intervals, we're getting follow after follow, short strike after short strike. FINALLY .. It comes, a true big girl follows to the boat, flares up at the figure 8... And a 1lb bass comes out of nowhere and hits the spinnerbait, and the pike swims away.  Oh yeah. Some days you kinda wanna forget."

790067,SirWhite,2013-06-03 01:19:00,210,"I hear ya. I was up in Peterborough area all weekend. Area flooded on and off Rain then later i got a sunburn. Couldn't get a follow on my 10"" Believer so downsized to a #5 mepps, caught an almost pound and a half Rock Bass, when up to 6"" Grandma an caught a three pound Smallie. Went back up to a willow blade tandem treble mepps and caught a 20"" Musky,I had no more sizes to try. Makes me question why I've spent so much money, ok that was a lie, it makes my Wife question it. Oh and I lost the screw retainer nut on my old Abu c4  Tough weather weekend"
