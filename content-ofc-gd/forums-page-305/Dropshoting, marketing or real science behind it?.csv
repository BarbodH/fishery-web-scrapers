789192,Roy,2013-05-29 22:22:00,13728," ""Drop shotting"" was all my brother and I did when we were kids. And yes, we always used live bait but that was only because plastics had not been invented for fishing yet. Rubber worms started to make their appearance in the late 50's and they were dreadful pieces of garbage compared to what we have today."
789194,Moosebunk,2013-05-29 22:23:00,3970, That's as good an explanation as any right there.  But that thar fancy shtuff does a darn tootin' good job of catching fish.
789205,Fish Farmer,2013-05-29 23:17:00,2234,"Some young guy just starting out thought he discovered something, a hook tied to a line with a bell sinker on the bottom. They have been using that technique for years in the east coast, they used to call it set lining, but with 50 hooks on the line for Cod fish or Tommy's. Of course you can only use 4 hooks hear on a set line, excuse me ""DROP SHOTTING"" Try using snelled hooks, it takes the hook out from the main line. A good example is a Sabiki Bait rig with Hage Skin. Only if we could get them here instead of over the border. They come 6 hooks in tandem, just cut in half and modify , run them upside down with a longer line to the sinker. One of these days I'm going to try and order some here, maybe Bass Pro? A good buddy brings them back from Florida for me. Click below for info "
789220,Lape0019,2013-05-29 23:56:00,647,"The easiest way I can describe it is a hook attached to the main line and a tag of whatever length you want with a pencil styled sinker on the bottom. You then attach a plastic of some sort to the hook and fish (for the most part) vertical beside the boat. The finesse name comes into play with how you move the bait. With a tight line you either provide a little movement to the bait by raising and lowering the rod tip very slightly while leaving the sinker on the river bed. You can also move it side to side a little bit to get the bait to dance in one spot.  It could also be described as finesse because of the style of baits that are typically used. In bass fishing, this would not be called a power fishing technique ( cranks, jerks, spinnerbaits... I think you get the idea) nor would it be a top water so I don't think it would have anything else to be classified as.  Adam"
789247,SirCranksalot,2013-05-30 01:31:00,3291,Thx L19-----I understand what you're saying quite well.----good explanation.
789343,Rich,2013-05-30 14:14:00,3927,"Everything in fishing is a variation of an older tactic.  Clothespin spinnerbaits evolved from in-liners.  Twitchbaits, jerkbaits, evolved from crankbaits.  Texas rigged plastic worms, well thats just a plastic worm on a hook right?  ""Wacky rigging"" .... Did anyone really believe they INVENTED that? I remember when I was a poor kid, we re-hooked the plastic worm in a million different ways, and caught fish, because we couldn't afford more plastic worms.  ""Flippin jigs"" ... Evolved from jigheads.  It's an ever changing, ever evolving game.. this does not detract from the effectiveness of the technique."
789354,Roy,2013-05-30 15:24:00,13728,"  You're absolutely correct Rich BUT, must we buy a flipping rod, a pitching rod, a worm rod, a dropshot rod etc??? That's where the marketing comes in."
789357,Rich,2013-05-30 15:41:00,3927,"I guess we'd have to ask people who bought such products. Did it , in fact, enhance their success with those techniques? If so , yes marketing, but also evolution."
789367,SirCranksalot,2013-05-30 16:17:00,3291,I assume that some of you have tried this for lakers near the bottom. Does it work well? I intend to try it later in June.
789378,jbailey,2013-05-30 16:50:00,866,"it works well. If you have a sensitive rod already then no need to buy a specific ""dropshot"" rod. The marketing involved just makes it easier to find the appropriate rod for the desired fishing techniques.. I mean, I'm not going to be dropshotting with my muskie rod, or throwing an 8"" jake with my ultra light. You don't HAVE to do anything, it just simplifies things - and its not like you can't use the ""dropshot"" rod for casting plastics etc."
789389,Lape0019,2013-05-30 17:14:00,647,"That is true.  I use a dobyns champion 702SF for dropshotting. The rod is recomended to be used for Dartheads, Shaking Worms, Shaky Heads, Tubes & Gitzits. It is a medium light rod with a fast tip and works just fine.  I used this rod as well on the long weekend for Perch and it worked fine.  I have had some people tell me that the 701SF which is recomended for dropshotting is too light of a rod for the purpose.  Personal preference when it comes to fishing is Key. Like JBailey said, you don't have to buy a specific rod for that technique, but if you wanted to the recomendations for that rod really help pick the right one."
789818,Dave Bailey,2013-06-01 18:04:00,1641,"I just make a quick and dirty set-up. Palomar a hook about 2 feet up the line, pinch a good size split shot or rubber core on the bottom, head for a rock fall that continues underwater, and enjoy pulling in smallmouth. Works for me. Anything complex is too much like work."
790161,The Urban Fisherman,2013-06-03 16:59:00,2050,"My opinion is that it depends on who's absorbing the information.  When I first shot a dropshot show with Dave for instance, I had never seen anyone fish a ""pickeral"" rig or any variation of the drop shot rig.  If I used live bait it was on a jig head, or below a few split shots.  So this was something completely new and interesting to me.  To you it's just a small variation of a pickeral rig, to me it's a drop shot.  After watching Dave smash smallies all day right infront of my eyes I was pretty well convinced that having the weight below the hook was something I should try.  I didn't have any pencil weights or ""dropshot"" hooks.  I also didn't have any bell sinkers and only a few tiny split shots that wouldn't be heavy enough.  So I grabbed some ""drop shot"" weights and  used wacky rig hooks that I already owned.  Do you have to use specific ""drop shot"" weights? NO.  You could use big giant split shots if you have them, or bell sinkers etc.    Do I use specific drop shot weights? Yes, but only because it's pretty well one of three types of finess fishing techniques that I do and I don't have any use for bell sinkers or big split shots etc.  Why wouldn't I use them?  That's what they're made for, they don't cost any more if you shop around and they work great for me.  As mentioned before, I use wacky rig hooks, because I truly believe that wacky rig hooks are better for wacky rigging which is also something I do often.  So I buy one kind of hooks and use them for both styles of fishing.  I don't see the need to buy specific drop-shot hooks for drop shotting.  For somebody who's been using a ""pickeral rig"" for years and has bell sinkers and hooks they're comfortable with, why would they go out and buy specific drop shot stuff?  Maybe said person desides they really love fishing a ""dropshot"" and when they run out of bell sinkers they pick up dropshot weights instead.  Maybe a teenager watches somebody fishing a drop shot on TV and has never heard of the pickerel rig?  To them it'd be something completely new to try out.  They try it out using whatever hooks and weights they have and BLAM start catching some fish.  Now they might want to pick up some drop-shot weights and hooks because that's a style of fishing that they might primarily use?  Some people just LOVE having ""the best of the best"" and if they can afford it why not let them.  They've likely worked hard to earn their money and if that's what they want to spend it on then who's to tell them they can't.  That's not my style, I'd mix and match hooks and weights depending on what I fish for, and I frequently use the same rod for drop shotting, tube jig fishing and throwing a Senko.  I say to each their own - and it should come down to common sense.  If you see something on TV or in a magazine, jimmy rig the gear you already have and give it a shot.  If this new technique works for you, then you can choose to keep jimmy riggin' your set up, or if you think it's something you're going to do often, you can buys specific weights and hooks.  As for my experience - I've seen some pretty finicky bass and walleye caught on a dropshot that wouldn't eat anything else.  So I don't think the hook being tied onto the main line is an issue at all.  Providing of course that the line isn't 65lb test power pro! lol  Aside from throwing crankbaits from time to time, my 6 year old and my 4 year old exclusively throw a drop shot.  They catch just as many fish and almost never get snagged because the hook is off the bottom. Any parent who takes their little ones out fishing should learn to rig thier kids up with a dropshot... it'll save them a ton of headaches!!!!!!!  anyways that's my rambling!  Cheers, Ryan"
790162,wkimwes,2013-06-03 17:07:00,76,"Also, drop shot works on multi species, works great on Crappie and Perch.  If you downsize your bait to 1-2"" minnow imitation it works well.  Just this saturday caught some nice panfish, of course did get a few OOS bass.  They seem to be very aggressive lately (caught 12), I caught 4 crappie and 10 perch."
790186,jimmer,2013-06-03 19:30:00,2730,"The whole fishing industry is about marketing and coming up with new ideas to market old techniques.Have you seen some of the paint jobs on those crankbaits?? That is for us. We give fish way too much credit, their brain is about the size of a dime?"
790276,Dave Bailey,2013-06-04 00:32:00,1641," Now you're giving them credit! Haven't dissected a bass head, but if its brain is the size of a pea I would be surprised."
790310,Old Ironmaker,2013-06-04 03:44:00,8243,"Thanks for all the great feedback folks, what I really couldn't grasp is the method of the hook tied directly to the main drop line. It goes against what I have come to learn. It seems to me that the fish needs to take the hook dead on. If it takes it from the rear the line would spook the fish. I may be way off here and overthinking the whole thing.  As for the marketing, I feel it is marketing by naming an old tried and true with a new name. But anything sold on any shelf or at any garage sale is marketing. Heck hideaway headlights were sold on cars in the 30's. When they came back some 30 years later it was something new.  Call it what you wish, it works."
789064,Old Ironmaker,2013-05-29 10:00:00,8243,"I am often called old fashioned, a human paradigm, even a dinosaur going down the river the wrong way whatever that meant, and that was 30 years ago. Please educate me, I hope old dogs can learn new good tricks. I'll try anything to put a fish on my line. I even bought a Colour Selector once.  Dropshoting, Aren't we talking about still fishing with vertical presentation. I always wanted to know the science behind this dropshot system. With that hook tight to the main drop line a fish needs to take the bait strait on I think. Point of hook first. If the fish strikes from the rear or side it would most likely feel the drop line and let go as that main line would not be free as it would if it was on a light tag. When we set up this type of drop shot the tag line was always made of the lightest diameter mono you could get away with and light split shot, just enough to hold the line vertical, keep the bait moving naturally if alive, up, down, left right. Dropshoting looks to be too static and goes against much I have learned. If you watched panfish and some game fish feed through crystal clear water IE ice fishing shallow Erie or snorkeling, you would see the fish inhale the bait by vacuuming in the bait, if something was amiss they would spit it out. Then often will suck it back in again. If they felt something was up they spit it and ran. Walleye are a inhale, spit and restrike if you have ever watched them diving. For another thread, don't want to digress here.  They are selling dropshot hooks, dropshot weights, do they have custom dropshot rods? Are we getting sucked in by marketing gurus in New York looking for our hard earned money? Or is there a science to this phenomenon that I'm not getting? I was one of those guys that ran to LaBaron or the Sportman show in the 80's everytime Al Linder mentioned a new product and tried to buy it.  I haven't tried the setup, should I?"
789067,Roy,2013-05-29 10:27:00,13728,"No need to learn this new trick. There's a good chance that most people started fishing as kids by ""drop shotting"".  BTW, I also have a combo-C-lector."
789068,buick14,2013-05-29 11:08:00,741,"Dropshot has worked for me for lakers through the ice, walleye soft/hard water the list goes on.  It's my go to finesse when going gets tough, in gin clear and muskoka type lakes for bass. It's the real deal.....I guess the principal behind it is a fish comes and looks at it, thinks about it, nips a little on the tail, likes what it feels and inhales and runs.  Most of my fish are all caught in the same place in the mouth.  Sensitive rod is a must or you'll be missing fish......it's a super soft take most the time.  No lie a great technique for almost all species.  So let me get this straight: Colour selectors are a gimmick?...next I'll be hearing the original banjo minnow doesn't have the same action as the infomercial"
789069,fishindevil,2013-05-29 11:36:00,6254,"The technical aspects are not new,but it's a lot more finnese presentation and yes it does work very well and is a fish catching application,and with the correct finnese rod you can feel everything and fish it in many different ways for example: following a nice drop off from 5ft down to 25ft and stay lightly in contact with the bottom and feel every single bump the whole way down !!!! It's amazing !!!! And the fish don't complain at all sometimes it can make totally inactive fish go crazy for it !!! The more arsenal you have to catch fish and use them the better your results will be !!! You should try it and you will see what we mean !!!"

789084,Mike Pike,2013-05-29 12:50:00,1332,I could not have voiced my confusion about dropshotting any better Old Ironmaker!  Looking forward to the input.  - A Fellow Dinosaur -
789086,Rich,2013-05-29 13:00:00,3927,"It is for WAY more than bass.  75% of my winter steelhead were on dropshots. What a great alternative to float fishing, and very productive.  90% of my spring crappies were on dropshots. I know of no other efficient way to fish deep crappies. Other ways work, but the dropshot eliminated time constraints and hookset issues caused by slip floats.  Perch? Try a dropshot with two hooks instead of a pickerel rig then tell me if you ever buy a pickerel rig again.  How about smallies? Ever drag tubes, jig spoons, and still cant get a bite? Put a big old Gulp minnow on a dropshot, and try to keep the bass off the line.  Grand River smallies inhale dropshots like nothing else in my arsenal.  I haven't done it, but I'm sure it would be a whole new world of tactics in a walleye or lake trout fisherman's boat.  The tactic is sure old. But as with anything , it has evolved to a far more productive tool than it ever was before."
789088,wkimwes,2013-05-29 13:09:00,76,"Yes, drop shotting isn't just a ""light tackle"" presentation.  You can use this in heavy cover too, like timber, vegetation etc..of course you would have to upsize the ""standard"" ML rod with 4lb test!  I have a MH/XF 7'2"" Casting rod I use for heavier application with 30lb braid and 12lb floro leader and use a 1/0 or 2/0 EWG texas rigged plastic."
789090,Moosebunk,2013-05-29 13:36:00,3970,"Funny first response Rich.  Gave a chuckle here man,  Dropshotting dramatically increased smallie numbers and size of fish last fall.  First season really applying it all, I was amazed.  Tactic would likely come easy to anyone who jigs walleye regularly, and this presentation on a couple totally foreign lakes worked very well.  Didn't go out and buy anything ""special"" for it other than the VMC hooks and some pencil weight sinkers.  Normal braided 10-20lb line, medium spinning rod, floro lead, hook and sinker, usual things required really. Yeah.. that way it all sounds old school, but it is a little more refined with some new products and even ideas for doing it.  Don't blow the bank getting all the marketed tactic specific gear if you have a rod that will do the job already, seriously.  Some guys seem to prefer all floro main lines...  Watched a buddy pluck a couple stubborn sunning specks that just wouldn't go for any other thing, even a worm under a bobber right over their heads.  Dropshotting is just one more tool for the trade."
789095,Roe Bag,2013-05-29 13:58:00,246,"Sinker. Two hooks. First one 8 inches up from bottom. Second 8 inches above that. Minnow on one hook. Worm on the other. Drop it over the side of the boat to the bottom and wait. Didn't matter if it was weed edges, weed pockets, shoals or holes. Started catching fish that way over fifty years ago.  Dropshotting new or marketing? Refined a little but just marketing."
789109,Sinker,2013-05-29 15:01:00,8692,"I still prefer the smallest 3 way swivel and a the smallest bell weight you can get away with, on light line.  It works better than having the hook tied direct to the line. Lure/bait has more action, and fish can suck it in with less resistance.  That's the way I started fishing, and will always use that rig.  S."
789118,adempsey,2013-05-29 15:19:00,1498,"Well, I always associated drop shotting with a horizontal presentation of primarily artificial plastic baits (the hooks stick straight out from the main line) .  The old school pickerel rigs or Kentucky rigs are most often pre-snelled hooks tied onto your main line and baited with meat.  It's not quite the same thing.  Even if you tied the hooks directly to the main line they would not stand straight out (unless you tied them that way) as they are supposed to in Drop Shot.   I really don't see this as marketing any more than saying trolling is a marketing term.  It's a technique and you don't need any special hooks or weights to do it.  It's all about how you set it up."
789152,Old Ironmaker,2013-05-29 18:44:00,8243,"Of course I've been dropshoting, apparently for years, just didn't call it dropshoting,  vertical still fishing or bottom bouncing a pickerel rig or Lindy rig was the term. Get as vertical as possible. A pickerel rig didn't always come with the horizontal wire, beads and pre tied snelled hooks, you could make them any colour and distance apart as you wanted, and they worked very well when all else failed, still do. The pitch and retrieve guys looked down their noses at you when we were "" dropshoting""  The confusion for me is the hook tied directly to the main vertical line sticking strait out and up. If dropshoting is setting few 3 way swivels and running a horizontal tag well we have been dropshoting since you were a minnow Rich.  We used to have a fullback, a half back and a tailback, now it's a running back, same guy.  Now I'm convinced it's marketing in my humble opinion. Dropshot weights, please. A thin pencil weight so not to get hung up, wait is that a Dropshot weight?  My colour C Lector always says chartreuse, always, just ask Al and Ron Linder."

I understand it's basically having a sinker below the hook, or hooks, but are there any other defining characteristics. I don't understand what would make that a 'finesse' technique. I'm not being sarcastic, just curious."

789181,Rich,2013-05-29 21:32:00,3927,"It gives your bait essentially a still, suspended approach. With today's plastics, normal movement gives your bait action. You have basically live bait, right in the fish's face."
789183,Moosebunk,2013-05-29 21:37:00,3970,"Why it's likely considered ""finesse"" is because of the subtleties of bait/lure movement.  One idea for best results with soft plastics for example, is to have a weight that puts you on bottom but isn't overly heavy, and just the line lightly jigged but keeping the weight still, will give the bait enough action to entice a strike.  It's a very unaggressive way to fish that works well.  But again, overall I guess it's almost as old as time... just back in fashion in a different sort of way."
789186,SirCranksalot,2013-05-29 22:01:00,3291,"Ok, that's the part I don't understand> What makes the modern way different?  Thx for the replies, guys. I thought folks mostly dropshotted with live bait, but it sounds like many, if not most, use plastics(Gulp minnows?)"
789188,Terry,2013-05-29 22:08:00,14456,"we use to use live bait and a big hunk of lead and any hook we had now it's plastic, special hooks and fancy sinkers"
