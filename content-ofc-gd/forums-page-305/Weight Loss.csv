780654,Handlebarz,2013-04-18 23:19:00,3790,All I can say is Pete looks like a new man I can not believe the changes he has made from Dec 13 to mid Feb to last Saturday I am so proud of you Pete its awesome to see how far you have come. And yes I could not stop staring at Pete all day in amazement.  Btw Danna did not know that was you until we were 5 min from home she asked why you were not at the odyssey but when I said yes you were and explained she was relieved as she wondered who the guy was that would leave his stuff with the booth I laughted so hard. Heck she did not even catch on when you left your shake bottle she thought why did this guys drop his bottle here lol.  Keep at it Pete
780655,Christopheraaron,2013-04-18 23:19:00,3525,That's amazing!
780766,Squid,2013-04-19 15:06:00,1656,Thanks everyone!! Mike thanks buddy and apologise to Danna eh lol!!!

783629,Squid,2013-05-01 00:10:00,1656,201.4 pounds this morning. Still in size 34. Total weight loss to date is 80.4 pounds. Tomorrow  commence two 300 calorie meals a day along with two shakes. 8 more weeks to go.
783635,Whopper,2013-05-01 00:17:00,2174,That is great news Pete. You should be extremely proud of yourself
783656,NAW,2013-05-01 01:14:00,4022,Just in time for summer!
788357,Squid,2013-05-24 17:52:00,1656,"Wow what a journey it has been. I want to wish all a very big and warm thank you for all the support, encouragement and positive vibes. It made my ride a lot smoother and for that I thank OFC. I had my last shake on Tuesday May 21st. So good to be free of the shakes and back to food again. I continue with 4 meals a day at 300 calories until June 21 or for ever if I wish. I am still losing weight due to me excercise. I weigh 196 now and I am 3 lbsaway from 90. My goal now is to hit the century mark and that is only 13 lbs away LOL. Truth be told it will be the hardest weight to lose throughout the entire duration of the diet. So the first picture is how all of you who knew the old me remember me by. The second picture is of a guy who morphed out of the first picture and threw away all the excess garbage physical and emotional. Thanks Folks. Maybe I will revive this post next summer and post a 1 yr after photo.  "
788358,lew,2013-05-24 18:04:00,12766,"Next time we fish together Pete, you better hang a name tag around your neck so I know who the heck you are"
788363,NAW,2013-05-24 18:31:00,4022,That's AWESOME Pete!!  The pic made me laugh out loud at work!
788365,Raf,2013-05-24 20:11:00,3495,svelte!!  congrats Pete.
788366,Roy,2013-05-24 20:22:00,13728,Just think how huge those muskies will look this year!  Congrats to you Pete.
788367,Joey,2013-05-24 20:33:00,9122,"Wow Pete, so proud of you!!!   You look amazing dear!"
788371,Squid,2013-05-24 21:23:00,1656,Thanks so much everyone!! Yeah for sure Lew!!!
788379,Ron,2013-05-24 22:48:00,1683,"Just incredible Pete!  I wish I had of followed this from the get go. A friend of mine has also done this. i see him at the coffee shop every morning. I keep thinking about doing the same program, I just haven't had the right time to start it.  You have given me encouragement simply by reading this thread from the first post. As soon as I get a chance to see the Doctor in Oshawa, I'm on it.  Thanks for taking the time to put these posts up Pete."
788417,Handlebarz,2013-05-25 03:12:00,3790,Pete as you know I'm so happy and proud of what you have done you are killer at sticking this out congrats. I'm looking forward to next Saturday to see what is left of you
788425,Squid,2013-05-25 11:40:00,1656,"Go for it Ron the positives far out weigh ( sorry) the negatives. It makes you feel like a 35 yr old again. Just the changes in testosterone levels back to normal is a strong enough reason to lose the weight. As I stated earlier, the more weight you add on the more estrogen ( female Hormone) your body produces and who wants to cry at a Expendables 3 eh ?! LOL.   6 days to go Mike!! Can't wait to put a 50 incher in the boat again!!  I can say that it makes me feel very good knowing that I stuck it out to the end.  It went by so fast yet it was 5 months of struggles to stay on course. Now lets go fishing folks!!"
788427,Whopper,2013-05-25 12:06:00,2174,Well done Pete!
788438,bigbuck,2013-05-25 13:37:00,2449,Keep it up!!!! You are looking like a completely different guy.
788639,mikeh,2013-05-27 02:50:00,824,"Congrats on the weight loss, I bet you were very excited when you broke the 200 lb barrier."
776794,Squid,2013-04-01 12:15:00,1656,Thanks Paul!!
777212,Squid,2013-04-02 19:53:00,1656,"WEEK 10 complete!!  Hard to believe that I have been at this for 10 weeks already, wow it has just flown by. Walleye/Pickerel opener is just around the corner followed by MUSKIE!! C'mon June 1st!!, need to get over to Chris's house and have a guide replaced on my walleye rod.  I dropped 6 lbs over the last week bringing my YTD totals to 61 lbs lost. Now I am on week 11 and then finishing the 4 shake a day portion on April 16th. April 17th will be my first meal for us and I am so looking forward to it. My Bariatric doctor has commented that he is revising my goal weight loss from 80 lbs to 100 lbs. As it stands now I weigh 218 lbs in the morning on my digital scale. I have 18 lbs to go to achieve my goal weight of 200lbs and it looks like I will achieve this weight before the end of April. This will leave me two more months of dieting to lose the remaining 20 lbs to achieve the 100 pound mark. I could end up at 180 lbs which I have not seen since I was 19 years old and could climb a tree without even thinking about it. I sit here and just shake my head looking at the potential numbers that I could reach. I used to take a chair out and place it next to the truck to stand on and then step on the tailgate to get into the box. This past weekend I unloaded a cord of hardwood and basically placed my foot on the tailgate and lifted myslelf onto it.  Peter"
777216,lew,2013-04-02 19:58:00,12766,"Your gonna have to put a sign around your neck with your name on it Pete, or I'm not even gonna recognize you the next time I see you."
777217,Squid,2013-04-02 19:59:00,1656,You are so right Lew. People are walking past me at work now not realizing it was me. Kinda weird at times. But BOY do I FEEL GOOD!!
777227,Joey,2013-04-02 20:26:00,9122,That is fantastic Pete.  Can we see an updated pic now?
777266,NAW,2013-04-02 21:52:00,4022,"That's great Pete!!!  Man, I keep opening this thread hoping to see some before and after pics..  But I guess you are a little ways from the ""after"" shot."
777290,Squid,2013-04-03 00:03:00,1656,"I want to 'weight' until April 16th, two more weeks and I will post a picture."
777292,Handlebarz,2013-04-03 00:04:00,3790,Pete your killing it doing a awesome job keep at it
777307,bigbuck,2013-04-03 01:07:00,2449,"Good for you Pete!!! Keep it up. I have to start my own change of lifestyle next week now that I am done chemo. I managed to put on over 50lbs in the past 6 months or so with all the steroids I was taking. My goal is 100lbs. I want to hover around the 200lb mark. I plan on being reasonable with portions, no more 16-20oz steaks with all the fixins. Long walks with the dog every night are also a big part. Thats why. I got the dog last year anyways."
777459,family guy,2013-04-04 00:40:00,22,Good luck!   Just remember if this isn't the solution don't give up.  I must have quit smoking a hundred times but one time it finally worked and have been smoke free for 12 yrs.  I to am now working on the weight over the last year of ups and downs and some persistence I'm down twenty pounds.  I'm hoping to drop another twenty this year to get my goal.  Your health is worth it but don't give up!
777535,Squid,2013-04-04 17:27:00,1656,Way to go Family guy. Yes this is the solution for me. There will be no other diets in the future as this lifestyle change is permanent for me. My past history of being a sports fanatic is rearing it's ugly head. I am already booked for indoor ball hockey through the summer inside an arena and I have signed up for hockey next fall and that will be 3 times a week at a minimum. Add to that weight lifting - walking/ running and you have quite the excercise program. My fitness particpation will be way higher than the average 54 yr olds excercise regime.
777554,NAW,2013-04-04 19:09:00,4022,"Put in a chin up bar Pete.  Man, I've been burning for 2 weeks straight.."
777669,i2cool2fool,2013-04-05 03:16:00,349,"WTG Squid and others. Focus, discipline and determination will be needed by me to get my lazy arse moving and doing the same - gut busting time. Hearing your stories help. Take care."
777685,mikeh,2013-04-05 10:55:00,824,congrats on your weight loss and sticking with the program. also nice to know that there is a program like this that will help people lose weight.
777770,Fishaholic,2013-04-05 21:01:00,22,"Wow, this thread has got fairly big.       Transforming your lifestyle instantly CAN be done (Often due to a scare/doctor's orders), but is VERY hard.        Often if you incorporate small gradual changes it is much easier. It can be as simple as cutting out pop, or cream+sugar in your coffee. Target one small goal at a time and once you feel it is a habit (They say it takes 21 days) move on.Gradual changes in diet/exercise makes it easier to be successful in the long run. Easier said then done, it is a constant battle to lead a healthy lifestyle.        If anyone wants to PM me on my two cents in terms of workout/gym routines etc, feel free. I would not consider myself an expert but I have a decent background in fitness/exercise. My degree is in kinesiology, I'm a qualified high school phys.ed teacher, and worked as a personal trainer in university."
780152,Squid,2013-04-16 17:05:00,1656,"Week 12 complete!!!  212 lbs from 283 in January. On four shakes a day I lost 71 lbs. Truly amazing stuff!! I started wearing a size 46 and I am now trying on size 36 which I may add are loose  Tomorrow begins with a new chapter in this journey. We start replacing one shake a day with a meal, 300 cals mind you, for the week. Next week its two 300 cal meals and two shakes and so on until May 15th where I am off of shakes for good. The remaining 6 weeks will be 1200 calories a day eating four meals. I will post the very first picture I took of myself and one from today."

Every one here  that is trying to lose weight seem to be all doing very well. I started to try and lose all that pizza and ice cream I've added since the last round of golf in November just this past Sunday. Every year the weight started to come of by it's own as soon as the spring thaw started, every year now I'm in my 50's it just doesn't happen naturally, takes hard work now.  If you haven't read the blog written by Shane on this thread that he posted the link to is below,  it's a must read.  http://instablogg.com/OR3kV4T  Again way to go all."
773880,mr blizzard,2013-03-15 20:30:00,1589,"Great job Pete, you have inspired many of us. You should be very proud of yourself. I told this to my 86 year old mother, she says Bravo,,,,She shares your victory, years ago she was the first woman to lose 200 pounds with a registered weight lose clinic in Ontario. I also want to thank you as u gave me things to think about,  for the first time in 7 years my bp is down from the 100 range to 85 range,  THANKS Blizz"

When i got divorced last year, it was as if i awoke, and realized that i was going downhill fast. Decided to get a grip, so i started watching what i was eating, ate when hungry, didnt when not.Started excersizeing in my gym, treadmil, weights, stationery bike. I can do 25 situps with no problem now, and 25 rep'ing with 75lbs weigths for biceps and pecs, no problems at all.I walk 5 k every nite, and bike 10 k twice a week.I love myself now, and so does my new honey  Paul"

I can't wait for this to be over so I can start my own weight loss plan. Its called keep yer dang mouth shut after 7:30pm. Only water after then. No sweets and reasonable portions of food. That combined with lots of walking seems to do the trick for me. 30 push ups, 30 leg raises and 30 sit ups for muscle tone once some weight comes off. And the drs orders, 1000 casts for muskies once a week."

774622,Squid,2013-03-19 22:55:00,1656,Week 8 complete  All is going well and we are being prepared to go on soild food again. I still have 4 weeks to go on the shakes so solid food is still a dream. Good news on the weight loss front. Today marks the day that I officially lost 50 LBS !!! Amazing that it all happened in 8 weeks. Its looking more and more like I will lose 80 lbs that I originally thought that I would lose. I have gone from a tight 44 to a 38 and that is it for the clothes. Once the 38's start getting loose there will be a shopping spree and oh its my birthday on the 28th! Maybe I will lose 54 lbs for my 54th birthday!!! Anyways thanks for following and supporting my journey it has been a blast to say the least. I will go out this weekend and buy an 8'6'' st croix Premiere extra heavy split grip as my gift to myself for losing 50 lbs!! Until next week!!   Peter
774629,mercman,2013-03-19 23:13:00,7054,"Awesome !!!! Nothing feels better than accomplishing a goal, especially one that changes your life. You are a lean mean machine now Bud !! Enjoy the gift and happy bithday in advance. I bought a Calcutta TE and a Tekota LC as my gift with the money i saved not smokeing. I will appreciate them more when i think of that."

774662,Rattletrap2,2013-03-20 01:21:00,1652,"Congrats on the 50 lb. mark! Way to go! Amazing given the short 8 week span. Just imagine, that is like lifting 5 sacks of potatoes off your body!  Your inspiration had a very good effect on me as well. I have dropped 21 pounds in the same 8 weeks. Not as awesome as yours, but I am feeling much better all the same. We changed our eating habits and lifestyle. It is slower, but steady all the same."
774719,Squid,2013-03-20 12:25:00,1656,Way to go RT!!! good job man. Lew thanks and thanks to Diane.
775732,Squid,2013-03-26 18:47:00,1656,"Paul ( Mercman) I read your comment and way to go on the 45 lbs weight loss and not smoking for Ten weeks!!! Oh man that is awesome!!  Week 9 complete.  5 lb loss over the last week bringing the total to 55 lbs. I set a goal on January 22nd to lose 54 lbs. by my 54th birthday this Thursday. Well I BEAT IT!! All health indicators are green or better. Now the doctor is discussing the potential of me losing 100 lbs by the time I end this ""diet"" on June 15th. Have to tell you that it is getting boring. Losing weight every week. It is becoming like groundhog day for me. I want to move on to the next phase which is drinking it up and partying!!! LOL JK. On April 23rd we will replace one shake a day with one 300 calorie meal a day, our choice of mealtime but their choice of what we get to eat. This pattern continues for the week and then the next week we remove 2 shakes and replace with 2 meals a day and so on until May 15th. Come May 15th we will be on 4 meals a day consisting of 300 calories a meal. This will bring our total caloric intake up from 900 calories to 1200 calories. We continue see the team until the end which is June 16th. From there it is maintenance once a month for a couple of years.  I hope that all that are dieting are seeing results and are sticking to it because the results are so worth it."

775856,NAW,2013-03-27 11:51:00,4022,"  Don't do it man..  If you can hold off on buying new cloths until you have reached your target weight and leveled off), that is a much more cost effective solution.  Trust me.  My clothes stopped fitting me halfway through my weight loss.  So I bought new clothes.  Then I lost another 20 lbs, and all the NEW clothes that I bought didn't fit me, and I had to buy ever MORE new clothes..  And I HATE wasting money on clothes.  Money is much better spent on fishing gear!!!"

End game is on April 22nd; we begin coming off of the shakes.One meal replaces one shake daily for a week and the following week it is 2 meals 2 shakes etc. until May 7th which is my end date. We continue to go to class for another 4 weeks for maintenance and more meal planning, portion control and nutrition classes right to the end. The staff provide you with all the necessary tools to succeed once you are set free. From there we can go to maintenance classes monthly for up to two years or so they say. All in all tons of mental support and medical oversight as we progress through this weight loss life altaring program."
770373,Harrison,2013-02-26 20:35:00,2202,"Awesome Squid.  I recently made a change in diet too, feel amazingly different.  It blows my mind how a change so simple to make can pay off so quick.  This diet is not so popular here it seems, but it makes sense to me.  And if you feel good doing what your doing and your getting positive results.... HK (who cares) what others think.  Keep it going pal.  May have a hard time recognizing you down at the launch now a days huh?  edit.. diet is a bad word... more of a lifestyle change."
770375,Roy,2013-02-26 20:37:00,13728,Well done!
770387,lew,2013-02-26 21:17:00,12766,"That's fantastic Pete, your really doing well."
770388,musky_hunter,2013-02-26 21:25:00,328,Is this covered by ohip?  I'm started my diet few days ago. Are you allowed veggies and some fruit??
770435,Joey,2013-02-27 00:40:00,9122,"Well I'm really proud of you Pete!!!  It does take willpower and determination, and you are doing exceedingly well IMO!  I started a ""lifestyle"" change the same time you started this one and I'm down 12 lbs now and have 14 to go to get where I want to be.  Some days are easier than others, but when you see results, it makes it all worth it.  Your clothes must be falling off you now.  Have you gone on a shopping spree for new clothes (that's the best part)  Keep up the good work bud.  Can't wait to see the end results and I'm very happy to hear they will be counselling you in the after part of it.  That is not easy either but it sounds like they are very professional and know what they are doing."
770513,Squid,2013-02-27 13:41:00,1656,"Doctors visits are all covered by OHIP along with the classes. The shakes are 80 dollars a week. Nothing but water, and 4 shakes a day is the life style change. Thanks Joey. Way to go on the weight loss and yes when you see the results your spirits soar!! No new clothes yet. When I am past size 40 is when the fun starts.  Thanks for all the kind words. What a journey.."
770514,solopaddler,2013-02-27 13:44:00,8605,Hey good for you man I can relate. I've dropped 27 pounds myself since Dec 31 myself and am feeling great.
770515,solopaddler,2013-02-27 13:47:00,8605,"Funny you mention that. I refuse to spend money on what I consider to be transition clothes. Value Village had a 50% off sale on Monday, I got an entire new wardrobe for $38 LOL!"
772032,Squid,2013-03-06 02:22:00,1656,"Week 6 complete and feeling great!! weight loss of 4.6 pounds and a total of 38.2 lbs. Its all down hill from here on in!! The weight loss has re-invigorated my desire to play hockey. I signed up as a pool player in the Burlington old timers and I already have a game tomorrow, my usual Friday and a Saturday. Looks like I will have no trouble finding exercise. To all the dieters out there, keep it up it is worth it!!"
772041,NAW,2013-03-06 02:46:00,4022,That's great man!  Sounds like right in the groove.  Now it gets really easy!
773356,Squid,2013-03-12 17:42:00,1656,"Week 7 complete: 5.6 lb weight loss over the last week. I am now down into the 230's and going strong. It has been quite a journey so far with the body throwing stuff at you to try and rattle you. Now I am fighting insomnia. But this could be due to me playing hockey 4 times last week  Doctor told me today to STOP it. Go for a light skate during public skating and pick up with the guys on Fridays is ok too but beyond that no more   I have so much more energy now. My garage is spic and span now. I installed new shelving with hooks and managed to clean up the entire garage. Into size 40 pants from a 46 and the 40's are starting to get loose now. As I mentioned before, I have pants to size 38 but I will need new shirts within the next week.  Being an fat man for all these years has taught me an appreciation for the daily battle that we go through just to get ready for work. No wonder heavier people have a higher metabolism, we need it. Be kind to folks that are carrying extra weight. It is not an easy life by any stretch of the imagination."

765315,NAW,2013-02-05 01:28:00,4022,"How you holding up Pete?  Here's some food (shakes) for thought.  I recently lost a pile of weight.  So I decided to have some fun and crunch some numbers.  I lost 50 lbs.  I drive a VW Golf. I commute  30,000 km a year in my car.  Due to the reduced weight in my car, I get marginally better fuel economy.  The math tells me $90 a year.  That's about 9 Baconators biggy sized.  Or a free Tim's double double for every time I fill up with gas."
765361,darsky,2013-02-05 04:09:00,586,what about the hunger pains-do you get them? They are very hard to ignore.
765501,Squid,2013-02-05 20:23:00,1656,"LOL NAW!!  Todays total is 7.2 lbs. For a grand total of 18 pounds over the last two weeks. The doctor took me off of one of my blood pressure medication so that is another positive. This weeks goal it to start walking every night and get back into light weight lifting to get the muscles going,"

765518,Squid,2013-02-05 21:31:00,1656,Dar I will not lie about the hunger pains. If you go beyond the 4hr intervals then yes you will experience some light hunger pains. I was not sure if I had eaten at 9PM last night so I had to ask the wife. I could have gone to bed without the shake because I was not hungry. The number 1 complaint regarding this diet is that most patients have a hard time getting the fourth shake in.  Yup nakid is not an option LOL. New clothes by the end of the month for sure. I am already struggling to keep in the clothes that I wear now.
765520,Joey,2013-02-05 21:37:00,9122,"That is terrific Peter, keep up the good work and please keep us updated."

One of my goals was to get off the meds and it is coming to fruition. Pressure without the 1st pill is now 117/70 used to be 155/95 with meds. Weight loss for this week is 6 lbs bringing the total to 23 lbs in 3 weeks!! Never felt better or stronger. It is going to be a great summer!!

762441,torco,2013-01-25 14:45:00,656,Good luck...In the last 3 months I have moved to a DASH like diet. I wouldn't say its a full dash by an means but I have cut out alot of sodium and other crap and its helped me lose weight gradually. I got off track abit over the holidays but am back on now. I have found it to be fairly easy and the biggest change as be substituting carbs and red meats with more vegetables.  I don't buy the cave man diet myself as on many levels it does not make sense to me but that said you should see results as it shares alot of the same premises with many healthy diets in that is big on fruits and vegetables and lean meats and cuts out the salt and sugars which are found in processed foods.  I think what turns me off the caveman diet is how restrictive it is if followed correctly.
762509,lookinforwalleye,2013-01-25 18:29:00,4399, What are your thoughts on Pork Rinds....any info???
762523,Freshtrax,2013-01-25 19:12:00,2215,"Your ridiculous , enjoy your McDonald's and Doritos . Your obviously misinformed on the topic of paleo diet.  My breakfast yesterday was sprouts , one egg and some grilled chicken.   Lunch  was raw carrots, peppers and grilled chicken.   Dinner was roast beef on the smoker for 5 hours) , salad, carrots, and cauliflower.    The beef and chicken all come from my dads farm , no hormone implants in the beef and the chickens aren't pumped full of antibiotics.  Now I cheat,  I do eat salad dressing , and make my own BBQ sauce using honey as a base instead of sugar.  I'll eat pork rinds , as long as they don't come from a factory"

Everyone seems to think eating paleo means steak, steak, steak and more steak.  Allot of people poke fun, and say its unhealthy ( most of my friends that did are the ones feeding their kids Kraft dinner and frozen pizzas multiple times a week)   I started eating the way Sinclair does and have honestly never felt better.  For the most part it means not eating processed foods. I thought it proved my point.  I'll eat pork rinds if I want to.  As long as they don't come from a factory, just like the rest of the food I put in my body. If you have any more questions feel free to ask.   I apologized for the Doritos part via pm.

To each their own. My girlfriend has been on the diet 5 months and does not feel better, nor worse, nor different."
762748,bigbuck,2013-01-26 15:13:00,2449,"Losing weight is all about making healthier choices for yourself. I have found the best way is to not eat anything after 8pm, cut down the amount of starchs I eat and stay away from fast food. The best advice was given to me by a cardiologist regarding vegetables, eat all you want of veggies that grow above the ground, limit your intake of those that grow below the ground. Stay away from WHITE, whether it be bread, sugar or potatoes. Good luck fellas."
762753,Musky or Specks,2013-01-26 15:28:00,2710,True pork rinds are a great breading substitute for fish or chicken while your on a ketogenic diet. I'll dip my fish in eggs and roll them in a mix of crushed pork rinds with some pepper flakes then fry em in butter. Now thats diet food

You can read it here if you like (they just posted it there and linked it on their FB page): http://instablogg.com/OR3kV4T  It was already out of date by the time they published it, but if I re-wrote it now the only things that would change really are the weight loss, which is now north of 100lbs.    I have no doubt that you'll lose weight doing this shake thing. Hoepfully the medical team also trains you on how to maintain it afterwards when you return to eating sustainable levels of food. Good luck..."

I have lost 38 lbs since Nov 1, 2012, the day my wife left while i was fishing :-) I decided then that if i was going to find me a new fishing partner, i would have to get lean and mean again.It does take something like that to force me into a new pattern of liveing.I started exerciseing, (i have a tread mil, stationery bike and weights down stairs), and i do it faithfully each nite after i get home. I eat when i am hungry, and if i am not, then i have a light breakfast type of meal.I add lots of veggies to each meal becaus ethey seem to fill me up, and are easy to digest and are low in calories.I have fought the battle all my life, and emotional eating is very difficult to cure with dieting and medication.You have to decide that its not worth being fat, if you are going to die younger.What i am trying to say here, is that it takes more than diets and doctors, it takes a complete lifestyle change to make weight loss a permanent thing.But if i can do it, anyone can, cause i am a wimp LOL !!! Good luck, and keep us posted.There is loads of support on this site.  Paul"

Unfortunately I have gained pretty much all of it back. The hard part for me anyway if maintaining the weight loss. I wish you all the best with that.  The last time around I lost 97LBS in 3 months, with proper eating and excercise. I have got about 50 of that back"
762104,Squid,2013-01-24 14:04:00,1656,Well I have managed to survive my first day. 4 shakes a day for the next 90 days. They do not tatse bad at all really. The vanilla one tastes like melted ice cream and the chocolate one tatses like cow patty and aspertame. Sitting in the fireplace romm last night I was struck by a need to get up and go to the kitchen and make a peanut butter sandwich. This trigger occured while I was watching a movie not a commercial. It happened to me several times through the course of the evening. I am starting to understand that this is not just a weight loss diet of shakes but a diet that also breaks your habits. I stay out of the kitchen as much as possible and I do not sit down for dinner with the family. I will give it a week before I rejoin the dinner table. Down one pound already and I only started the first shakes yesterday. Doe not sound like much but it does provide me with encouragement. Until next week.
762105,Squid,2013-01-24 14:06:00,1656,"Yes CPH losing weight is easy it is breaking the habit/cycle of eating that is very hard. It is almost like an addiction, when something gives us pleasure we want more of it."

Or cave man diet for the last month because I was tired of eating crap.  I'm always on the road for work and it was fast food 5 times a week.  The premise is simple.....the human body has evolved for 150 000  years to digest meat, fruit and vegetables.  Only In The last 10 000 years was grain and agribusiness introduced.   If a cave man couldn't eat it either can I.   I've never felt better.  No counting calories, lots of steak chicken fish lobster whatever. Just no grain, watch the sugary fruits and limit potatoes (carbs)."

762116,DoubleDigits,2013-01-24 14:44:00,140,"I'm no nutritionist, (my own diet is fairly horrible) and if a certain diet works for you great...but the logic behind the 'paleo' diet, the idea that what our paleolithic ancestors ate (which ones? from what part of the globe?) is somehow what we as a species were intended to eat, is silly on many levels."
762117,Squid,2013-01-24 14:45:00,1656,"Well to be truthful, this diet is high on protein so I am not experiencing any hunger pains at all. I almost forgot to have my last shake last night. I was fearful that I would wake up very hungry this morning but it was not the case. Thanks for the support. On another note, I was amazed at how many of my friends suggested other diets including cave man knowing full well that I had already committed to this one. I do not understand why this is. Is it not better to just support your friend regardless of what diet he or she is on??"
762127,Freshtrax,2013-01-24 15:06:00,2215, I think most of us were just saying great gob for taking that step as many of us have also had the same realization you did. We need to shed  a few pounds and eat healthier.
762130,NAW,2013-01-24 15:15:00,4022,"Thanks for the Update Pete!  It's all a mind game.  Loosing weight is so easy, once you master your mind.  Call them Triggers, or cravings..  What ever.   Your body / mind need to get used to a new routine, and once that happens, you will be so amazed at how fast the weight will fall off.  Keep it up man!  As, for some people suggesting other diets to you..  Don't take it the wrong way.  They are just letting you know what worked for them.  If they feel that what you are doing will be detrimental to your health and well being, I would fully hope an expect my friends to voice their concerns.  You just need to practice selective hearing, and do what you feel is best for you.  Keep us posted on your progress!"
762181,TJQ,2013-01-24 18:29:00,7806, Ahhh... upbeat as always!!  Hey... Squid!!  Good luck...  now if they only had diet beer..... (well maybe they do.. but I aint drinkin' that!)  Im sure you'll be ok!
762213,Rich,2013-01-24 20:52:00,3927,"I lost 130 lbs 6 years ago.. 1 1/2 hrs walking a day, no change in diet besides no pop and far less candy/chocolate/pastry.  However you do it, good for you!!!! Stick with it, you'll feel 100% better when you do!"
762222,Rich,2013-01-24 21:09:00,3927,"Maybe wheat? Lol  All in all it took 12 months, from there I uncontrollably lost another 20 or so in the next few months, but I lazied up my metabolism and kept the weight for a while, though since summer I've been packing it back on steady despite my efforts to walk as much as before. Guess I'm getting old and the diet may also have to change drastically to keep a healthy weight."
762225,jim,2013-01-24 21:12:00,124,Geeze man! Really?  212 and you diet!  That's my target weight!!
762255,Squid,2013-01-24 23:13:00,1656,"Not taking it it the wrong way at all, it is an observation. I already understand that this 'diet' is also a habit breaker. Thanks so much for all of the support from the OFC!!!"
762256,Squid,2013-01-24 23:14:00,1656,Too funny HD!!!
762257,Squid,2013-01-24 23:16:00,1656,Excellent work Paul!! It will make you much healthier. I was getting fed up with almost passing out when realeasing a muskie lol
762262,Squid,2013-01-24 23:19:00,1656,Totally agree with you Sinc. Processing and pasturizing is slowly killing us. Sugar is the worst IE fructose. Drinking black coffee is not that bad at all.
762264,Squid,2013-01-24 23:20:00,1656,LOL!!!
762267,Rich,2013-01-24 23:27:00,3927,"I understand wheat, dont believe I could completely give it up but could certainly use less buns and bread.  Soy I gave up years ago. I'm not religious about it but I do a pretty good job avoiding it.  Corn however, why? The starch?"
762268,misfish,2013-01-24 23:28:00,29133,"When I went on the dump the weight,it was from 235 down to 170.Waist from a 40 down to  34. It took me 5 months. it was all natural. Ate vegies and fish,turkey and chicken. NO SUPLIMENTS AT ALL Did the gym 6 days a week for 3 hours a day. Swam for an hour each day. (The best thing you can do. Working all your body)It was a great feeling. After about 4 months later,I felt it was way to light for me. Worked my way back up to 190.  Missed chips,dressing and gravy.LOL.Kept my waist at 36,and boosted my upper body structure to a good bulk of muscle and fat. Muscle alone is not the best. I have gotten a bit behind now,as I,m up to about 206 now.It,s just in my geans. Im not fat,just a bit over weight,but I feel good with it. I feel healthy,  I seen my two brothers about 3 weeks ago. They were always slim,could eat and not put any weight on. Their catching up to me now.LOL  Good luck Pete."
762276,NAW,2013-01-24 23:43:00,4022,I did the same diet before my wedding Brian.  215 down to 168. Gained it all back.  Then lost it. Then gained it back.  Alex was born 4.5 months ago.  220 down to 174 this morning.  I've done it 3 times in the last 10 years.   Can't be healthy.  But I feel great!  I lose weight fast and I gain weight fast.  It all my fault though.  I eat like a pig until I hit a breaking point.  Then I work out like crazy and eat really well for 6 months.   Repeat...
757621,Squid,2013-01-08 21:48:00,1656,"First came the quitting of cigarettes 6 yrs ago already!! My how time has flown by!! My next phase is to lose the 70 or so extra pounds that I have put on over the last 20 yrs. I am fed up with asking my buddies to tie my skates LOL just kidding. I see this as an opportunity to improve my health and allow me to live longer LOL. So starting on the 15th of January I will be in the bariatric clinic in Hamilton General embarking on the biggest challenge of my life. My freinds tell that it will take will power, determination and courage to go through with this. I hope that I have what it takes to go through with this.The diet consists of 4 optifast shakes a day ( 900 calories) for 3 months. Nothing else but water and excercise. While on the shakes we will be overseen by a staff of nurses, nutritionists, doctors, nurse practitioners and psychiatrist. I know that folks will say that this is dangerous etc... but it is very carefully monitored by the staff to ensure that our health is of utmost importance. I am tired of being the fat guy in midlife and I want to improve my life. It is so easy to say 'hey just excercise' or stop eating etc.. What folks need to understand is that everyone is a unique indiviual with unique needs and wants. For me, I have never really tried to lose weight. Being a jock most of my life up to having kids gives me a perspective of what is needed to stay in shape and if I started working out now with the weight I would probably have a heart attack. I am thinking of taking a picture of myself at the front door of the house on a weekly basis to see how I look and progress over the next 12 weeks. Wish me Luck!!!"
757627,irishfield,2013-01-08 21:55:00,26272,"Good luck Pete... You can do it.... if you want a peek at my families cardiology history it would be enough to scare you there alone! I dropped from  a high of 228 to  a consistant 191, simply by taking regular Pepsi out of my life and switching to diet. Same amounts... just removed the sugar."
757628,lew,2013-01-08 21:57:00,12766,"Best of luck Pete, you quit smoking successfully, now you've got another challenge to take on."
757630,Whopper,2013-01-08 21:58:00,2174,"Geez Pete I had no idea you felt that way about your stature, I kind of thought you were like me, vertically challenged and horizontally endowed  Seriously good luck with the weight loss, I hope you just don't lose your sense of humor. "
757637,Joey,2013-01-08 22:25:00,9122,"Best of Luck Pete.  I know you can do it, and although 900 cals a day will be hard, it can be done.  The hardest part I'm afraid to say is keeping it off after.  I hope they have a plan for you for the ""after"" part.  If not, I'd suggest Weight Watchers to keep you on track.  I've done lots of diets and weight loss programs, as I don't like to get over a certain weight.  I can attest that it creeps back on very easily, but if you stay on top of it, you can keep it off for good!!  Updates would be great !!"
757648,Guest,2013-01-08 22:56:00,0,If it doesnt work try getting a paper route.  Walking around 6-7 days a week delivering newspapers will do it.
757661,bigbuck,2013-01-08 23:14:00,2449,Good luck!! I lost 25lbs last year by going on the 'keep your dang mouth shut diet' I have patented it. Nothing but water after 8pm and be more realistic about what you eat. Try to walk as much as you can. Exercise makes any diet much more efficient.
757663,Musky or Specks,2013-01-08 23:15:00,2710,Or you could change your lifestyle to paleo or ketogenic and lose the weight gradually.
757686,lookinforwalleye,2013-01-09 00:23:00,4399,"Good luck with quest to drop some weight, after stepping on the scale after the holidays and weigh in at a all-time high of 212 pounds on Jan. 3rd I decided it was diet time again. The only good thing is I seem to be able to lose it just as fast as I put in on.....weighed in today @ 199"
757689,Handlebarz,2013-01-09 00:32:00,3790,I know how you feel Pete I hope to drop done by musky season in June. I was shocked when we were fishing in december snd you said it was 6 years since you quit smoking that time went so fast.  I'm trying the cutting some junk out of my life and actually moving route. I wish you the best of luck and I hope that come summer neither of us have our shoe laces tied to the side.  For anyone who is not or has not been over weight you have no clue how hard of a choice this has to be for Pete.
757709,NAW,2013-01-09 01:43:00,4022,Good luck Pete!  I just dumped 40 lbs in 4 months.  Proper sized portions of food.  Run 5 to 10 km per week.  Drink lots of water.  That's how I did it.
757714,Acountdeleted,2013-01-09 02:03:00,2562,"Good luck. You can do it. 2 years ago I dropped about 40 pounds and the first couple of months was the hardest thing I ever had to do in my life, but now having succeeded I would do it all again in a heartbeat. Although everyone has their own needs and wants one thing everyone needs to be successful is support. We're all rooting for you."
757721,adempsey,2013-01-09 02:14:00,1498,"Good luck on your mission!  I think that's a really tough way to do it, but I do hope it works out for you."
757739,Hooked,2013-01-09 03:43:00,891,"Good luck with it.  Figuring since you were able to quit smoking, you should be able to conquer this as well.  A guy I work with went through the exact same place you are going to.  He did lose weight but I guess he lost his will power and put it on again.  But you are right, determination and courage will be needed in large quatities for your task.  But after awhile, if you keep with it, will hopefully just be a normal life-style for you and won't require all that much courage and determination.  Good luck."

757748,lookinforwalleye,2013-01-09 04:16:00,4399," Don't think so I did this diet 10 years ago and dropped 33 pounds in 10 weeks, ketosis works for me while other people have difficulty with it. Appreciate your concern!"
757774,Squid,2013-01-09 13:25:00,1656,""" I hope that come summer neither of us have our shoe laces tied to the side"" Too funny Mike!! Anyone who is overweight totally gets this comment!! LOL Thanks for all the wll wishes and stories of weight loss. It is really encouraging to read so many stories of weight loss. I wish all who are on this path to continue with the battle of weight control. My biggest fear is Diabetes. This disease will creep into your life without a thought and strike you down with no warning. To all of you who do not watch your weight or do not have annual blood tests done, I strongly recommend that you get checked out. It could be your live saver. Joey I will update this thread as I progress through the weight loss journey. Best part about this diet is that you have to attend a class every week on nutrition and proper eating habits. So when you do start back on regular food you become accustomed to your new life style.  Sinclair, I believe that this diet is kind of a ketosis diet. I will look further into it but I believe that I will be consuming less than 23 grams of carbs a day. This is what is required to go into ketosis. Forces  the body to attack the fat for energy in lieu of the carbs kinda thing."
757775,lew,2013-01-09 13:32:00,12766,No more steamies for you bud
757779,Squid,2013-01-09 14:01:00,1656,LOL you got that right Lew!! No more beer  etc....
757784,Raf,2013-01-09 14:22:00,3495,"try to put on some muscle, lift some weights -- it'll make keeping it off afterwards easier; speeds up your metabolism, and gets your body consuming more energy even while you're sitting on the couch munching on celery sticks.  while it may be a little difficult on 900 cals / day tho, most people who are overweight can still gain muscle on a calorie deficit before plateauing.  good luck!"
757785,lookinforwalleye,2013-01-09 14:22:00,4399, Rum and Coke Zero!!!!  0 carbs!!!
757788,BillM,2013-01-09 14:49:00,17367,900 cals a day is going to be a tough gig to keep up...   Goodluck!
757789,highdrifter,2013-01-09 15:14:00,2534,  Oh yes you can!!  Best of luck.
757805,Rattletrap2,2013-01-09 16:40:00,1652,"Good Luck Pete! All the power to you! Maybe this will inspire me to do something similar. Maybe not as drastic, but I need to do something!"
757812,gordy28,2013-01-09 17:05:00,638,"Hey there - good luck on your quest Last March I decided I wanted to lose some weight - and for added motivation my brother and i made a bet largest % weight loss by Sept won  - loser bought winner his choice of single malt scotch  I followed the Eat Clean diet to begin with and then made my own modfications plus I started to walk the dog for 30 minutes every night and do 50 push ups a day  I lost 45 lbs and have kept it off - started at 230 and have been 185 for 6 months Check out eat clean - bottom line - limited salt and refined sugar, good carbs and limited booze - and for me the weight melted off For carbs - i ate a lot of sprouted grain bread - ezekial is the brand - and always began the day w plain rolled oats with flax seed and bulgur wheat added in - fills you up Cheers Gordy"
