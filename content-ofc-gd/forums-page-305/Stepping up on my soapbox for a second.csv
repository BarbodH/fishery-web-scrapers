788462,capt_hooked,2013-05-25 18:21:00,212,"Good post Jeremy ... the guy knew what he was doing... (bass fishing)... maybe did not know the local regs... possibly? So you tell him bass fishing is closed.. see what he says.. and go from there..  Now as laPlumma... says.. many areas.. down south have no closed season.. and plenty of bass... and just this year... the area around and west of Sudbury open bass year round... (too many bass?)... so the rules... may not be the best...?  Now about the other issue of one guy pretending to fish one species but really targeting another.. on Nipissing we closed it ALL fishing until opening day... that eliminates the ""perch"" fishermen hauling off boxes of walleyes.. just prior to the Long Weekend opening...  We also had a fall closing on Oct.15.. (to all angling) but the local ""meat eaters"" convinced the local MNR to reopen the fall season for pike... (Local people here would never be caught eating pike (well o.k. most of them anyway)... But now after October 15 walleye closing ... when the walleyes are really aggressive; you should see all the ""pike fishermen"" packing into the good walleye spots..."
788472,northernpike56,2013-05-25 20:53:00,717,I've seen a guy catch an 8+ pound walleye in Hamilton harbor with a white spinnerbait. Weird thing was it was from shore in the middle of summer too.
789980,fishermccann,2013-06-02 16:02:00,655,I catch crappie under docks with spinners every spring. Yes in the kawarthas.
787915,camillj,2013-05-22 03:11:00,1988,"Yep .. I left the pike alone this weekend so the bass could guard their nests .. and bagged a tasty little three piund laker for my troubles  Just off my dock there's about a 5lber ...he scoots whenever I go down to the water .. so I've been avoiding that ... hopefully in a week or two it'll be safe to go down again ... the perch and sunfish dart in as SOON as they are off their nest ... not devastating but if it happens alot the results will definitely have an impact... so its not just about targeting the fish .. its about disturbing them ...  (BTW my biggest musky 44"" was caught flipping - for musky - right under a guys dock who told me he'd been there 30 years and never caught a musky ....next day there musta been ten cottagers in a row all casting off their docks ... so I moved out to deeper water and landed another 40+  just to prove it wasnt luck ...heh  And YES I always do the figure 8 for pike and for musky .. and I use pretty much the same baits ... only chasing the big girls .. no snot rockets here"
787924,Dontcryformejanhrdina,2013-05-22 04:45:00,535,"I've tried jigging for walleye this year in deeper water, only got bass/perch. Tried casting diving baits for walleye in deeper water, only got bass. Went to shallower weeds and caught 6 pike on jerkbaits but also got bass (even a rock bass), didn't seem to matter where I went or what I used, there was the odd bass. Hard to fish exclusively for 1 species in these shallow lakes and rivers, different species all occupy much of the same water where I fish.I've used small musky baits for pike fishing once before (all of my biggest pike have come on musky baits) as a way to avoid the bass, caught an OOS musky instead. So I switched to using husky jerks the next time out, ending up catching 3 pike, another OOS musky and even more OOS bass. Not to mention I've had bass hit 9"" musky lures, seems like you're damned if you do and damned if you don't. The only time I DON'T catch the odd bass when they're not in season is when I'm fishing for lakers. If I'm catching walleye or pike, you can be damn certain there's bass there too. Am I supposed to avoid fishing pike/walleye because I can't stop the insanely aggressive bass from hitting too? I don't even target bass anymore, once June comes around I'm usually musky fishing so it's not like I love catching them and can't help myself. It's actually frustrating getting a hit and finding out it's just a bass. I wish I could hammer 1 species while avoiding all others, but I've never been able to figure that out. At the same time though, I'm not pitching docks either lol.By the way, I figure 8 for pike too. My biggest pike came on a figure 8 and I've caught more pike boatside than musky."

787960,Old Ironmaker,2013-05-22 12:46:00,8243,"I just returned from an upstate NY lake. Met the boys from across a few states. Prime target? Spawning Largemouth. It's legal, it's all mind set. I don't know how long it has been legal in NY state but can tell you sight fishing for spawn beds isn't easy, and that lake which is only about 400 acres is heavy with bass. I don't know how I feel about it. I cross the border and an hour latter if I climb down to my beach, pinch down a Barb and toss a topwater I'm now a criminal. I've been looking to hook a Gar for years, can't this year, the gar are spawning 2 feet from the bass beds. When they are done they will be too close to the beds as I know I will hook an OOS smallie.  I have been watching Smallmouth spawn here from the deck for 18 years, the guarding males are more concerned about other males taking their beds than other species eating coffee grind size fry."

787964,outllaw,2013-05-22 13:09:00,1232,get a pair of dark sunglasses. you will see less. here on st clair guys walleye fish everywhere 4-9ft for post spawn walleyes . they catch tons of basss/muskies/sturgeons. they just unhook and let em go. proving a persons targetting a specie is super hard to prove... as posted above its when guys get weirded out then fish bass on beds in an open area but whine when guys accicedentily catch bass . new york state and michigan have early season catch release.. the issue will never change. mnr/dnr cannot patrol everywhere.
787977,ch312,2013-05-22 14:15:00,1590," i'm not a musky fisherman and i've caught many pike beside the boat while doing figure 8's and do it every time when pike are following to the boat. saying that anyone who does figure 8's (especially when you know the area is full of pike) is automatically targeting musky is as silly as saying anyone who owns a gun is going to kill someone    believe it or not, but many people could care less what assuming spectators think they're doing.  also, it's quite silly to suggest people targeting pike should downsize lures and avoid figure 8's because some musky fisherman might assume they're targeting OOS musky. on many of my pike outings i'm throwing 10-12"" baits to convince even the small pike to bite."
787985,Lunker777,2013-05-22 15:19:00,866,"People catch bass while fishing for Perch, Pike, Crappie, and Walleye this time of the year.  In order to satisfy all of your wants and needs..... they would need to close all fishing in order to keep bass from being caught.  I used to be all hardcore about not catching/fishing for bass OOS..... I still don't TARGET bass OOS.... but I have a tough time drinking the kool-aid when the imaginary line dividing lake St.Clair dictates weather its OK or not OK to fish for large/small mouth. I caught a 10"" smallie on monday while pulling harness for walleye.... should I have left at that point ? Fishing 10-12 ft of water... I surely wasn't trying to catch smallies.  A buddy caught almost 400 small mouth while jigging for walleye on the Detroit river this year, in ONE WEEK mind you. What was he suppose to do ? pack up and go home after the first bass was caught ? Move to a different spot on the river ? Well news flash..... THEY ARE EVERYWHERE !!!!!!!  As it was already said here..... if you came home from a day of fishing and this is the taste left in your mouth..... you missed the point of the day."

I've even had pike wait for me at the side of the boat while I put the lure back in the water and start it moving again...dang silly pike. Long story short...I figure 8 both species (as apparently some other guys here do...and here I thought I was the only one!)

788435,John Bacon,2013-05-25 13:20:00,3277," You are right, you never know... I caught a bull head on a jitter bug once.  I don't think that there are any lures that would only catch one species of fish.  If one species will bite it, so will others.  If a lure is more appropriate for a specific species it is probably because it is good at getting into the species habitat.  I.e. surface lure for large mouth bass because they often feed at the surface; spinner baits are good at getting weeds and other structure so they are good for fish that live in those habitats."
788444,BillM,2013-05-25 14:03:00,17367,"I've caught more walleyes this year while fishing for crappie then I ever have before.   Not complaining however, lol."

Lots on spinnerbaits, caught a few on topwaters ( zara spook, and skitter pop), huge musky jerkbaits, musky bucktail spinners, big musky bucktail jigs, and right down to 1"" tubes for crappies. At this time of year, eyes are very aggressive.  If you put it in their face, they will take a poke at anything!  S."
787731,Acountdeleted,2013-05-21 17:45:00,2562,"If I'm out of line on this, please someone tell me but this really bugs me.  My parents have owned a cottage in the Kwarthas before I was born and our lake is fortunate (after this weekend I'm thinking unfortunate) enough to have great bass, walleye and muskie fishing. With the long weekend and walleye being open there were a lot of people on the lake. As a rule, I have a couple of spots that I like to hit up for a walleye but if I catch a bass I won't go back to that spot until after bass opener (call me a little neurotic but I don't like bothering or hooking into spawning fish)  There were a few spots I saw people fishing, rocky shoals and weed beds in <4 feet of water where I knew all they would catch are bass but I kept my mouth shut as, they are just trying to have fun and probably didn't know where to target walleye.  What really really got me was, on sunday afternoon, a guy with a a bass boat worth more then my car, comes trolling by all of the docks on our side of the lake, tossing what looked like a spinner bait in and around all of the docks. Now, again, don't judge a book by its cover, but this guy looked like he knew all too well what he was doing and all he would have been doing is pulling spawning bass off of their nests.  Has it got to the point where people just don't care anymore? The mentality of 'I'm going to catch the fish I want, when I want and unless I get a ticket I'm going to keep going?'  Don't get me wrong, I like keeping fish for dinner as much as the next guy, but I would really like it if, when I have children or grandchildren, I can take them out to catch more then just White Sucker an Carp."

787739,Harrison,2013-05-21 18:08:00,2202,Bass boat means nothing. It's like saying everyone who drives a Porshe is a good driver and knows all the rules on the road. Complete nonsence.  Any dolt with $50k can buy a boat.  Some of my favourite water is the thickest milfoil and in less then 4ft for walleye on the Kawarthas.
787740,Acountdeleted,2013-05-21 18:15:00,2562," Was up on the deck. didn't get a chance to.  I didn't mean because of the boat. 4ft of Milfoil I totally agree with you on that one, but the guy who really burned my bacon was pitching and flipping under docks. I haven't fished a lifetime but I've never caught a walleye under a dock with no surrounding veg before."
787741,aplumma,2013-05-21 18:16:00,6896,Please note that I am in a place where it is legal to fish for bass all year around. I have fished in the time of the spawn and returned the fish back to the water in a timely manner. This is what I have observed. The bass will return to the nest area and continue to guard it. I have seen very little predatory reactions from the surrounding fish. I  know there are many that say this condemns the nest and we have wiped out a whole brood of bass. I think the impact is minimum on the bass as far as the breeding and year of the young. Now the important point is if it is illegal for them to be fished  then that is what I would be angry about. As far as devastating the lakes population I think that it is not likely.   Art

787745,mike rousseau,2013-05-21 18:35:00,4661,Happens everywhere...  As soon as one predatory species opens its a free for all....  For example... If pike is open... A spinnerbaits is a great pike bait...  It's very hard to prove...  I used to pound pike in the opening few weeks on buzz baits.... Legitimately.... But then the next guy could be using the same bait for OOS bass... Only a few feet shallower right beside me....

It bugged me but what can you do as they were in a area full of pike of they down sized and were not doing the figure 8 it would not look so bad.  I really get a kick out of the guys whining about OOS bass fishing but head to the NY side of the big lake to target the same fish the cry about on our side of the water.

787788,Acountdeleted,2013-05-21 21:52:00,2562," See, but I have no problem if you're targeting crappie. This lake has zero crappie, zero pike. It has perch, walleye, bass, muskie. If you were in 3 feet of water tossing a 4 inch spinner bait into docks, I think it would probably look a little suspect too.   When I'm out on the water, I love it. I caught nothing  but some sunshine this weekend and I loved it. I was happy to be alive and outdoors and even just washing a few lures.
