789876,Old Ironmaker,2013-06-01 23:26:00,8243,"I try and avoid the rain if possible but hate having wet feet. I took the spikes out of a pair of old soft sole waterproof Footjoy Dry golf shoes and saved myself more than a few bucks based on what some of you guys pay for footwear. No they don't slip on the floor of the boat. Then if I absolutely must golf in the rain I screw the spikes back on, 2 for 1 specials."
789917,glen,2013-06-02 04:35:00,2641,"Mike I am wearing a pair of waterproof breathable runners from crappy tire. I saw them on sale for 50. Not sure if they are still on sale.  Good all round shoe.  I wear every day. 2"" of puddle and still dry.  For deep sea I have cabelas boat shoes. The deal for fibreglass deck"
789933,bigcreekdad,2013-06-02 12:20:00,546,"Believe it or not, I cut the boots off an old set of waders. Amazingly warm, dry, and they don't slip in the boat. I go thru a set of waders every couple years, so I get ""new"" rain boots."
789934,MCTFisher9120,2013-06-02 12:24:00,3761,"No shoe is waterproof especially when fishing a week straight and getting poured on every day (Last August my camping trip) The answer is Shimano Evair sandals, there like croc's but much much better. Very light, comfortable, and made with EVA foam similar to the material used on the rods.1  http://fish.shimano.com/publish/content/global_fish/en/us/index/products/gear/Footwear/evair_sandal.html  They dry fast too"
789941,kickingfrog,2013-06-02 13:01:00,8333,"In the spring and fall I wear a good pair of insulated rubber boots. In the summer I don't care what I'm wearing on my feet when it's wet as long as they don't slip.  On a side note I never wear cotton anything cause it sucks when wet. Nylon pants and tops (or quick dry or what ever trademark name you prefer) makes for very comfortable fishing hot or cold, wet or dry."
789945,lew,2013-06-02 13:09:00,12766," Sorry Mike, but my Sorrell Gortex hiking boots are about 14 years old and they are still absolutely waterproof to this day even after all the wear they've had.  I payed $185 back then for them and their worth every $$$$"
789947,kickingfrog,2013-06-02 13:13:00,8333,Water proofing is easy. Soaker proofing is not. Soakers are when you step into 13 inches of water with a 12 inch boot.

789961,lew,2013-06-02 14:33:00,12766," Merrell has had a great reputation for years but I'm wondering if their starting to go downhill.  I bought a pair of Merrell sandals 2 years ago and payed $115 and when I got home and took them outta the box I noticed alot of the stitching was already loose. I took them straight back to the store and exchanged them for another pair, but checked them carefully before leaving and they looked fine. I wore them for 2 weeks and then I noticed the stitching was fraying and coming apart so I took them back for a refund.  I complained to the manager about the garbage they were selling and was told that because nearly every make of sandal is now in the far east   that's what we could expect from now on.  The Merrells were made in China  I ended up with a pair of Columbia's made in Viet Nam and after 2 years their still in decent shape."
789202,Handlebarz,2013-05-29 23:02:00,3790,I am a barefoot fisherman but when it's raining I don't want to have soaked feet this year. What do you all use for keeping your feet dry when fishing in the rain. I don't mean waders or just rubber boots I will be in the boat and need to be comfortable.
789206,Rod Caster,2013-05-29 23:22:00,5784,Mike Borger recently posted about the Neo Overshoes. They seems like a very dry and comfortable option.  http://ontariofishingcommunity.com/forums/index.php?showtopic=69768&hl=%2Bproduct+%2Breview
789210,Rizzo,2013-05-29 23:24:00,4754,"Mike I'm like you. Lots of the time barefoot, occasionally in crocs"
789212,woodenboater,2013-05-29 23:34:00,2277,I'm wearing either Teva watershoes or World Wide Sportsman shoes (BPS). I like foot protection whether in a boat or on land.
789215,Ron,2013-05-29 23:39:00,1683,I will stick with my Merrils when it's raining. It's like a hiking boot but Gortex.
789216,Lape0019,2013-05-29 23:40:00,647,"The last few years I just got wet feet from wearing tennis shoes. This year I have gotten sick of being wet and cold and just ordered a bps 100mph rain suit. To compliment the suit, I am planning on buying a set of of Soloman shoes like these that are made with gore tex to be waterproof yet still breathable.  http://www.gore-tex.com/product/salomon-exit-2-gtx-shoe/1324239403453/  Hopefully I am done with being wet while fishing in the rain!!!!  Adam"
789231,danc,2013-05-30 00:30:00,4677,"I bought a pair of Gortex lined Kadiak brand hunting boots about 15 years ago. They look like work boots but are very light and comfortable. They were pricey, about $300.00, but have paid off for me. Downside is that they are very warm and your feet could get overheated in warm weather. Fortunately that's rarely an issue for me."
789235,Dontcryformejanhrdina,2013-05-30 00:50:00,535,Cold weather: insulated rubber boots. Warm weather: crocs. They don't keep my feet dry but with those on I don't care if my feet get wet or not. Also saved me from hooks once or twice. I'm too disorganized to fish barefoot. That would just be an accident waiting to happen.
789245,Ainsley,2013-05-30 01:24:00,142,Waterproof merrells for me.

789303,FloatnFly,2013-05-30 12:20:00,1640,"either sandles or a pair of $7 swimming shoes from canadian tire, mesh top with a rubber sole, i also use em for wet wading in august an september.  that way you're feet aren't sweating an you don't have to worry about stepping on a misplace hook"
789307,lew,2013-05-30 12:41:00,12766,"If I'm alone in the boat in warm weather it's usually bare feet, anyone else along and I'll put on sandals. When the weather gets cold it's either  my Gortex lined Soloman hiking boots or the lined rubber boots."
789325,mattyk,2013-05-30 13:28:00,2110,I always wear my gortex rain shoes. If its a nice day in the summer I wear my flip flops.
789334,BillM,2013-05-30 13:58:00,17367,"Flipflops, my Salomon 4D GTX's or rain boots if the weather is really wet."
789338,wkimwes,2013-05-30 14:04:00,76,"I have a pair of work boots that is rated for chemical spills and has steel toe protection.  I know it's overkill, but I don't have a need for them anymore as they were for my previous job when I did have to go in a dangerous area.  it is waterproof of course, I have used them a couple of times this year very comfy and always have dry feet.  Not to mention if something tried to bite my toes they are in for a treat."
789346,Raf,2013-05-30 14:31:00,3495,"when it's warm i go barefoot or sandals..  when it's cold i have waterproof goretex socks and wear them alone, in sandals or in whatever footwear."

789477,scugpg,2013-05-31 01:13:00,1373,asics gt 2000 gtx runners are waterproof and very comfortable. I have the older model and they are great. ecco makes nice hikers that are gore tex.

789815,Dave Bailey,2013-06-01 17:57:00,1641,"For jumping in and out of the canoe, or wading in the water for fishing, or to put the outboard on the back of the inflatable, I just buy those cheap $10 running shoes at WalMart, the ones with the velcro closures. They only last a season but at that price who cares? Can't find an on-line link, but they're on the shelf.  Oops, didn't notice you wanted to keep your feet dry, just assumed that it's pretty well impossible when fishing."
789844,Fisherpete,2013-06-01 20:11:00,1814,I wear Merrell hikers with goretex - awesome and around $150.  I bought a pair of the waterproof but not goretex Merrells the year before - HORRIBLE - and almost as expensive! Waterproof is useless if it is not breathable!!! You get wet from the inside!!!  Pete
789872,ColdH20guy,2013-06-01 23:09:00,312,gotta love my Zeko's..not waterproof by any means but they dry pretty quick and weigh only 5 ounces...
