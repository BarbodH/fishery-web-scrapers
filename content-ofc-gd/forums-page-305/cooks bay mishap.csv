790387,jammer,2013-06-04 16:31:00,43,Could have been much worse...  Wonder what happened for them to end up in the water??
790389,BillM,2013-06-04 16:41:00,17367,My guess is that they were in a 10ft dingy trying to jig for whitefish.
790402,cityfisher,2013-06-04 17:45:00,959,"must of been a mini boat for them both to fall overboard .. or a canoe.. Reminds me of the day I saw a 100lb man and a 250lb women in a 10 ft dingy trying to go for walleye on quinte(electric motor).. i warned them that just because it was calm right now doesnt mean it will be all day.. quinte is known for harsh waters..they laughed at me.  when i came back in from fishing they still werent back, i called the opp...they had capsized near shore and were stranded somewhere.. the helicopter spotted them and opp came to save them in the dark...they came back to shore and didnt say a word to US... too embarssed to thank someone for saving their lives .. lol"
