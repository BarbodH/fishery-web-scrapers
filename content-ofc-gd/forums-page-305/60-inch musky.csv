And when the local media and politicians will not take on the important issues. For fear of stirring up the hornets nest.  Unfortunately, not at all unexpected.  I do get tired of hearing the red-neck line.  It is so predictable.  And my meds are just fine...!!! I will try and behave myself in the future......  O.K. I am going to bed now and dream of catching a 60-inch musky....!  I need to relieve the stress!  the cap't  ouch...!"
