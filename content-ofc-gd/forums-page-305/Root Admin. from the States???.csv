790221,Bigworm,2013-06-03 21:42:00,119,How is it that the Root Administrator for Ontario Fishing Community is from the States. Isn't there anyone from Ontario that can do that job? Just askin'?
790227,aplumma,2013-06-03 21:49:00,6896,The root Admin  was the 77th member of this Board 14 years ago if you have an issue with Americans being part of this board you will not have a long and happy life here. Feel free to discuss this in a P.M.   Aplumma  Art Melancon  US citizen
790228,Terry,2013-06-03 21:49:00,14456,why are our fishing licenses done in the states?  lol  dang they get all the good jobs
790231,Roy,2013-06-03 21:57:00,13728,This root admin is from Quebec. Did I win?
790233,Sinker,2013-06-03 22:03:00,8692,Does it really matter where anyone is from? I don't understand the question?  S.

790238,aplumma,2013-06-03 22:13:00,6896,He is irritated at me because I  informed him his ad for the 2006 smoker craft was not following the rules and broke the link. I then got a p.m. from him asking why and I sent him a copy of the rules with the rule part bolded. He has since corrected it and I am sure in a little while he will wish that he had not started this thread.

790241,FloatnFly,2013-06-03 22:17:00,1640,"if the location wasn't there, would you have noticed?"
790242,Bigworm,2013-06-03 22:21:00,119,"It has nothing to do with that, I was just curious. Besides, anyone with any administrative prowess would not have said that over an open forum after he clearly stated any further discussion should be done in a PM, in his last post. Nice move, RA."
790244,lew,2013-06-03 22:25:00,12766," Yup, you got that right Art  "
