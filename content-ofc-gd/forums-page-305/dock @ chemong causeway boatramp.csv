789931,lew,2013-06-02 11:56:00,12766,Does anyone know for sure if the dock is in place at the boat ramp on the west end of the Chemong Lake causeway ??  I may fish there tomorrow if the dock is in but will go somewhere else if not. It's a great ramp with good parking but can be a pain by yourself without the dock to tie up to while parking the truck.

789984,HTHM,2013-06-02 16:35:00,4082,"I could consider it, however I have a job interview tomorrow. Raincheck?"
789991,lew,2013-06-02 17:32:00,12766,"You available tomorrow Shane, I'll probably fish till early afternoon. .   Absolutely Albert, anytime at all."

790005,lew,2013-06-02 19:26:00,12766,"Thanks Steve, I know about that one but just prefer the causeway ramp but will be a back-up if need be, or maybe even run up to Emerald Ilse."
