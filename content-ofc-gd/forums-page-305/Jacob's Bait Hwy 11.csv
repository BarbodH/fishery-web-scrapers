790197,davey buoy,2013-06-03 20:14:00,5505,"Great info everyone,wonder how she stays in business?,not all of us are chippy/happy first thing in the morning.lol."
790203,misfish,2013-06-03 20:51:00,29133," It,s still the original owner,just a different SERVER."
790210,davey buoy,2013-06-03 21:11:00,5505,"????,missing that one."
790215,Fisherman,2013-06-03 21:27:00,7201,"""Different server"", I dunno, last time we got minnows there, it was a nice little blond, maybe 20 years old.  I wouldn't care if she could boil water,  she gave us one monster sized scoop of minnows.  Heck she could even be my boat bunny."
790216,davey buoy,2013-06-03 21:29:00,5505,"Mine too by the sounds of it ,lol.Thanks for clearing that up."
790217,misfish,2013-06-03 21:31:00,29133," That she does.. Then again,that place always gives you yer bucks worth."
789450,Rizzo,2013-05-30 22:18:00,4754,Anyone been up there lately? We'll be going by around 6:30 am on Wednesday and would like to grab some bait. Just don't want the woman of the house to yell at me again. Anyone been up there mid week before 7 am? Is the shop open at that time or will I be taking my life into my own hands if I ring the bell?
789454,kenzy31,2013-05-30 22:54:00,261,"We were there Monday last week for shiners and worms and if I remember correctly the sign said 6am to 8pm, 7 days a week. Good luck"
789458,Cosmos,2013-05-30 23:19:00,588,Answering machine says the same - they are open at 6 am. You can call them day before (705) 323-9111 and arrange the time.
789463,Rizzo,2013-05-30 23:56:00,4754,I did that once...call the day before. They said no problem. I warned them that if they didn't get up I would be relentless. Next morning they didn't get up...then I was relentless...then she taught me some new words.
789464,Fisherman,2013-05-31 00:05:00,7201,Bring her a big Timmies and muffin.
789469,Rizzo,2013-05-31 00:25:00,4754,...oooo bribery...good thinking!
789522,misfish,2013-05-31 10:03:00,29133,  YA THAT WILL WORK.
789525,wallacio,2013-05-31 11:11:00,475,"Whenever I've gone into the basement of that place, I have this fear that I'm going to wind up like Bruce Willis' character in ""The Gimp"" scene of Pulp Fiction LOL."
789528,Rizzo,2013-05-31 11:53:00,4754,wallacio...its been a while I think. They no longer use the dungeon and its not the woman who comes down in the nighty and bare feet. Now they have a shop in the shed/garage
789533,wallacio,2013-05-31 12:12:00,475,Heh...thanks Rizzo...good to know!   Maybe I'll start going there again LOL!
789556,Squid,2013-05-31 14:13:00,1656,I just flirt with her and she gives that gorgeous grin and stuffs my order with extra minnows and that was at 5AM in the morning a few yrs ago. I will be swinging by there next Friday night on my way up past marten river for a 4 day peace and tranquilty trip with my youngest. I will make sure to give her a hug for all of you. Oh anyone remember her name?
789569,Roy,2013-05-31 14:52:00,13728," Yeah, I think they call her Frank."
789576,fishindevil,2013-05-31 16:03:00,6254,
789577,fishindevil,2013-05-31 16:04:00,6254,thanks roy !!!!! coffee just came out my nose.....
789585,misfish,2013-05-31 17:16:00,29133,"It,s a different woman Pete. This one has an addittude. No peep show. If you look above the tanks,it wont be long til the roof caves in. Scary."
789587,adempsey,2013-05-31 17:29:00,1498,Is that the place with the sign that has the 24 hours crossed out? Lol.  That always makes me laugh when I drive by it.
789594,Rizzo,2013-05-31 18:01:00,4754,"hahahahaah sure you do. I bet you're thinking of the last lady who was super nice any hour of the day. The new one, although more presentable, is unflirtable."
789640,SirCranksalot,2013-05-31 21:46:00,3291," You mean as in ""Let's be Frank. I'll  be Frank tonite, and you can be Frank tomorrow nite'? (old joke)"
789647,misfish,2013-05-31 21:57:00,29133, LMAO Good one

789706,SirCranksalot,2013-06-01 01:48:00,3291," You must know the unedited version of the joke, then!"
790070,Squid,2013-06-03 01:35:00,1656,OK now I have to stop there RIzz!! I need some simcoe shiners for my walleye trip with my son anyways. I will report on the visit
790119,Rizzo,2013-06-03 11:36:00,4754,"Good luck Pete. Rememeber, never look her directly in the eyes and speak with confidence....she can smell fear. And when you leave, back away slowly. Remember, never run."
790121,Rizzo,2013-06-03 11:44:00,4754,"...and if you can crack a smile out of her you da man! I have a buddy who is a good lookin dude, and a major flirt. He flirts with all ages and sizes. And I mean ALL ages and sizes. Just loves to make the lady's day. He doesn't flirt with her, sometimes doesn't even get out of the car...pretends like he's sleeping. We used to have a hoot chatting with the former ""belle"", now its just all about the bait. Get yer bait, get the heck out. Get back in car and laugh about the glare."
790123,Roy,2013-06-03 12:06:00,13728,oooooooooo  I smell a contest in the making.
