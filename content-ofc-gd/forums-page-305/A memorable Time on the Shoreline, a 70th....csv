789878,Leecher,2013-06-01 23:39:00,7832,"A good friend of mine, Raymond, called me last night, asking if I wanted to go specks hunting tomorrow.... reply was... YOU BET   even though the weather forecast wasn't at it`s best   but who rely on a forecast anyway  Then it dawned on me.... Ray's birthday's is tomorrow (70th - June 1st 2013)....  AWESOME    Let's make the best of it  Up at 5h00am, car packed by 5h30am, couple of stops for gas and breakfast and made my way to Ray's home.... got his gear pack in the car and when he got into the passenger side, had a gift for him laying on the seat....  Inside was a card and a framed picture of his last trout he had caught last week    like this one below:    His smile made my morning even though rain was coming down pretty hard... got to destination at 7h15 and by 7h30 were setup and fishing  Rain was coming down a little and the black flies weren't too bad... then I hear Ray say:  Fish on     Got his first trout in the box  Then he says to me: "" C'est 1 Zéro  ""  Well, that right there, put a big smile on my face  As the morning progressed, the black flies got busier but the pokadots were shy... so I decided to light a fire next to shore and lay a few layers of pine needles... that created a cloud of smoke for a while and kept them at bay  By noon, the black flies were relentless and we just couldn't take them  anymore   so we left  Trout count... 6    all caught on my slip bobber rigs Made my day  Last pic... trying to get creative... this what I was able to get  Bonne Fête Raymond!
