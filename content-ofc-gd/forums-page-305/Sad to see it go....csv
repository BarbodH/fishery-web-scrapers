I cant say I was addicted to steelhead fishing until this fall. I had a blast on a trip with Mike last spring which did keep me interested. Then my friend Josh harassed me enough, I gave in and went with him. I picked up my first float combo, a cheap one but good enough to get me hooked.  Well the first fish I hooked on the float was enough to for me to know I was going to like it. Surprisingly I landed it and it was a half decent chrome hen.    Well I ended up hooking into one more that afternoon and it broke me off. That day truly was enough for me to become addicted to float fishing and steelhead.  I fished a ton this season. Over a hundred days on the river easy from fall to spring, my longest streak was like 15 days straight on the river and I loved every moment of it. The coldest day I fished was -22 with the windchill, it sucked but we caught fish and that was worth it.  I couldn’t truly count how many I hooked or landed but in my eyes it was good.  On top of the addiction of float fishing, was the gear addiction. After fishing with Mike and him kindly letting me use his higher end gear and try it out. It wasn’t long before I was building my first custom float rod.  I had Chris build me a rod before and I loved it. I wanted to try and build one myself. I asked Chris and I got a lot more then I could have imagined in return. Not only Chris was going to help me but I could build it at his place with his tools and one on one lessons, you could say. I couldn’t thank him enough and still cant.  Well here are some fish from this season.                                 Thanks Mike, Chris and Josh. You guys helped make my season that much better.  Now that the float fishing is done it is time for Lake Ontario trolling until musky opener. A good start to the season on Lake Ontario as well. First fish in the boat was my first Atlantic Salmon.    Oh I almost forgot. This is my PB steelhead.    Hope you enjoy.  Chris"

789634,Live2fish85,2013-05-31 21:11:00,1633,"Thanks guys, I appreciate it. It was a blast out there this season. As soon as the crowds finish with Salmon I will be out again all winter.  Chris, lol. I got rid of the glasses about a week after getting them haha. After I dropped my Revo's in the river I needed a pair bad and they were all I could find for the next day haha.  Brian, we wll have to get out this fall."
789651,spincast,2013-05-31 22:12:00,3279,"Awesome year dude  and great report- watched you bag them one (two, three,  five) at a time drewling over each one. A great show of not letting the curve balls life throws you slow you down."

789734,Moosebunk,2013-06-01 03:29:00,3970,"Been getting more into tribbin' as well.  Really liked the fall time spent, and then this springs first efforts.  Don't have the custom pole and pin though, so to the elite my experience might just be considered ""gay.""  lol.  Impressive post to say the least Chris.  Amazing inaugural year to great steelheading and certainly some perfect time spent on the rivers.  All time fishing is time well spent.  Solid pics too."

789782,Live2fish85,2013-06-01 12:33:00,1633,Thanks guys.  I can say that with out the help I received I wouldn't have hooked near the fish I did.  Thanks all.
