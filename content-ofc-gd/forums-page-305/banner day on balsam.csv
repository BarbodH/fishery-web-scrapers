789176,fishindevil,2013-05-29 21:07:00,6254,It's not just balsam lake either pike have spread all through Haliburton as well !!!!!! The beech lake maple and grass lake chain all have pike now as well as boshkung and they are spreading like crazy I reported my pike catch 3 years ago to the MNR in minden and I gave them a picture of it as well and they just said they are there to stay now and are established !!!!!! And that same chain has muskies too !!!!!  Big trouble on the horizon
789178,fishindevil,2013-05-29 21:18:00,6254,Sorry to contribute to the off thread discussion !!! Great day you had on the lake and well done !!!! Tight-lines.     Shawn

789257,sofabed,2013-05-30 01:58:00,119,What happened to Darryl Choronzey and his tv show?
789468,beagle dad,2013-05-31 00:23:00,224,ran out of places that would let him stay for free?????..lol
789504,Rich,2013-05-31 02:36:00,3927,Ha. ^^ .... What does cronzy have to do with this?!
789568,ehg,2013-05-31 14:52:00,2666,"Seems that in smaller, shallow Kawartha lakes (Mitchell, Canal, Percy's Reach) the pike take over.  In larger, deeper lakes (maybe Pigeon, Buckhorn, etc....), there is a good chance they co-exist as musky spawn in and live in  deeper waters. There are many examples of larger bodies of water where both species live."
789595,Ron,2013-05-31 18:07:00,1683,Where can I read this study? I don't believe it for a minute. Who wrote this thesis?
789757,Rich,2013-06-01 10:18:00,3927,"I would think #1 would be perch, as the kawarthas are littered with them.  That being said, it never fails when I visit the k-lakes - EVERYTIME I jig for walleye, one gets eaten by a musky on the way up during the day at some point."
789847,Fisherpete,2013-06-01 20:20:00,1814,"If I am not mistaken, different strains of muskies spawn in different areas - some in deep water, some in the shallows like pike - I would imagine the Kawartha strain spawns shallow - and the tigers coming out of Balsam probably prove this. As mentioned, maybe in the Kawartha lakes with deeper waters the muskies will adapt and spawn deeper and the two species can co-exist like they do in Gbay and certain other bodies of water. Maybe stocking of that strain in the future?  I think the Darryl Choronzey comment was to suggest a solution - if he had a few pike fishing episodes filmed in the Kawarthas with his famous shore lunches the pike population would be greatly reduced lol!  Pete"
789854,Rizzo,2013-06-01 21:11:00,4754,"nice call pete...never thought of the shore lunch chronzy angle. I just thought they meant when you mention the chronzy name you get a heated debate, kind of like the ""invasive pike"" debate"
789858,Rich,2013-06-01 21:35:00,3927,You know swaying of the locals and visitors to believe that pike are a tasty nuisance should not be hard. Fishing pressure can actually have a huge impact on them.
788889,JoshS,2013-05-28 17:04:00,729,"I think the issue other than competed for food and spawning grounds is that pike spawn and hatch earlier than musky, and juveniles eat musky fry potentially impacting the population. It's happened on other lakes like canal, crowe, where musky fishing used to be good until pike invaded... Now the musky fishing sucks. Look at what happened to Elephant and Baptist!!! It's scary to think that could potentially happen on Balsam, really scary.  However I can't really notice an impact on musky fishing yet other than catching lots of snot rockets and seeing the odd tiger. Let's hope they coexist fine. I remember 4-5 years ago pike in Balsam were kind of rare, now we see them every trip. It's really interesting how other musky fisheries were destroyed with the intro of pike.. I'd love to know exactly why and how long that took. Fingers crossed this doesn't happen on Balsam! I pray they stay out of cameron, sturgeon, pigeon and the others but realistically it's inevitable."
788980,Sinker,2013-05-29 00:00:00,8692,"I guess when your favourite musky lake is full of dink pike you will understand where I'm coming from.  If you want pike, fish a pike lake, not the kawarthas. Kill 'em all!  S."
788986,Sinker,2013-05-29 00:11:00,8692,"Back in the day, crowe lake was loaded with musky. Lots of them.....and many of them were big! My dad and I have had 15 fish days there for musky. Try catching one there now........good luck! Have fun with the dink pike. If your lucky, you'll get a 30""er.  When that fishery went to pot,w e started fishing around our cottage, on elephant lake/baptiste. AMAZING musky fishing. My PB musky is outta there, and many,  many many fish over 45"". I haven't caught one there in about 5-6 yrs. Just a couple years after I got my first pike. Its hard to catch bass and walleye there now too........but......if you want dink pike, its like shooting fish in a barrel. They're a dime a dozen, and nobody wants them.  Ask the owners of elephant lake lodge how pike affected their business. Oh yeah, that's right, they're out of business.  Inevitible is a good for nothing pike fishery in a lake that used to be amazing for musky. You guys who think its neat to catch the odd pike, and tiger musky will be the first ones whining when ya can't catch a musky in the kawarthas anymore.  I promise to kill every single one that graces my boat, and I hope everyone else who catches one does the same.  S."
788998,beagle dad,2013-05-29 01:13:00,224,go fish a muskie lake not the kawarthas.. u are obviously not old enough to understand the cycles a lake and nature goes through or just out for your own satisfaction not the future of lands and waters
789002,Terry,2013-05-29 01:22:00,14456,pike in balsam has nothing to do with cycles  just look how bad canal lake is 25 years after pike moved in....balsam cameron then all the kawarthas
789003,Sinker,2013-05-29 01:23:00,8692,"I'm older than you might think, obviously. Educated too. You clearly didn't read my next post where I wrote my experiences of two separate lakes, one shield lake, nowhere near the kawarthas.  I've never seen muskies do any harm. To a walleye population, have you? Anyone else? Its an old wives tale, unless you can show me some proof!  S."
789005,beagle dad,2013-05-29 01:25:00,224,fishing is not about catching !!! its about the time you get to spend outdoors and sharing those special moments with family and friends  GO OUT CATCH A FISH WHILE ALONE...YES ITS SPECIAL GO OUT WITH FRIENDS AND FAMILY CATCH A FISH OR NOT....THATS WAY MORE SPECIAL
789009,beagle dad,2013-05-29 01:34:00,224,and yes be prepared those that think that in the future pike will not be in all the kawarthas if they are not be warned THERE HERE!!!!!!!!!
789010,beagle dad,2013-05-29 01:38:00,224,as per studies MNR/SSFC... THE #1 FOOD SOURCE FOR MUSKIES IN THE KAWARTHAS WALLEYE!!!!!!!!!
789011,ccmtcanada,2013-05-29 01:40:00,7971,Back to the original post.....  Great day fishing for sure!   Conditions were tough and you managed to catch some nice fish.  Congrats!

There are thousands and thousands of pike lakes in ON. I'd bet less than half of that have musky. Protect them while we have them. Once they're gone, they're GONE!  S."

789015,beagle dad,2013-05-29 01:48:00,224,and so I guess your fishing days are comeing to an end or you will have to travel elsewhere to catch your precious musky
789016,Sinker,2013-05-29 01:50:00,8692,"Ok, so muskies eat walleye. Geeze, your smart. Wait a minute......the kawarthas are full of musky......AND walleyes.....now I'm confused.  You can argue with me all you want, wreck your fishing report, and make yourself ( and me) look like an idiot, but pike are NOT a good thing in the kawarthas.  Agree??  S."
789017,MJL,2013-05-29 01:52:00,2427,I don’t fish for muskies – I have actually never caught one (but would like to one day)  Here’s one article I found which details the issues of pike/muskie relationships in the Kawarthas  http://www.mnr.gov.on.ca/stdprodconsume/groups/lr/@mnr/@letsfish/documents/document/264328.pdf  I’m surprised that they found pike and tiger muskies in Scugog  Pike are open year round in the Kawarthas. Darryl Choronzey did say that pike tasted as good as walleye during one of his fish fries on TV...
789018,Sinker,2013-05-29 01:55:00,8692,"Yeah, my precious musky. Are you saying I'm some sort of musky elitist? I'm far from it. As a matter of fact, I spend less time fishing for, and catch less musky than any other fish.  If you think pike getting into these lakes is a good thing, you need to give your head a shake, or do some research.  S."
789019,buckster,2013-05-29 01:57:00,530,Pike have no place in the kawarthas IMO.   Kill them all!   I'm with sinker on this one in terms of the value of a Muskie fishery.
789022,beagle dad,2013-05-29 02:00:00,224,good thing or not irrelevant...they are not going away my report was just that a report! catching fish to me is what its all about....who cares about species! fished across this great country of ours am privileged to have the ability to go fishing I enjoy others catching fish as much as myself no matter species your kill them all attitude is the issue ...statements like that makes real fisherman everywhere look bad
789050,glen,2013-05-29 06:40:00,2641,Sinker is right.  Have they had this problem anywhere else?  US maybe.  If so did they have any success fixing it?
789074,Rich,2013-05-29 11:42:00,3927,"How do you know pike were 100% the reason for the decline of musky in your lakes?  You know I caught a pike in Rice Lake 12 yrs ago. They havent overpopulated it in that time yet. Maybe, pike thrive when lakes change?  Lakes just change.  I could tell you a whole bunch of lakes I fished before, that USED to be amazing fisheries.. for pike, bass, musky, crappies, perch... Guess what? The well always runs dry. There were no new species introduced to those spots.. just new fishermen.  It's easy to immediately blame a scapegoat for the decline of your success... But unless you're a biologist who never leaves the lake, you dont know for sure that pike did anything to your muskies."
789087,Terry,2013-05-29 13:05:00,14456,on canal mitchell  and balsam it was the MNR biologist that said no pike should be released back into the lake
789103,Fisherpete,2013-05-29 14:39:00,1814,"I do agree that I don't think pike getting into Balsam is a good thing - but with the numbers that are in there now, I seriously doubt that anglers can fix the problem - that`s all I was saying. After reading this post yesterday, I decided to take a run up there yesterday - and in 5 rainy hours caught ten pike, nine of them in about an hour and a half window. The smallest was 25 inches, the biggest two were a 33 and a 34. Gotta tell ya, it was a blast catching them! I`m a musky diehard, and hope that they can co-exist, but only time will tell.  I also caught a 20 inch walleye (slot) and a LMB. Didn`t see any skis in my travels, but then I was fishing my fave pike spots with small lures, not my ski areas. Water temps (60-61F) and weed growth are still behind - hopefully the hot weather in the next few days gets things going for opener! (I won`t be out though - stuck working   )  I don`t keep a lot of fish in general, but Balsam pike do often come home with me - I eat a few, and have family and friends who love them. But I would never kill one just for the sake of killing one. I have seen locals on Dalrymple catch a pike, slit it`s throat and throw it back - and when I asked them why, they said it was to protect the walleye that they had paid for to be stocked in there.   Not the way to do things in my opinion. Did someone from the MNR really say to keep or kill any pike that come out of Balsam? Maybe years ago when they were just getting reports of pike in there? I wonder if they would still say this today - can anyone find out?"
789104,Sinker,2013-05-29 14:41:00,8692,"Ever wonder why pike season in the kawarthas is open all year?  I'm honestly shocked that so many people are arguing that pike are OK.  Do some reading.  I'm no biologist, but I do have a biology background, and I've seen first hand what happens when pike get into a new lake.  Rish, its was 100% pike that decimated the musky fisheries in both lakes I mentioned, and that is fact, not something I made up, or assumed. Do some reading, its all out there.  Every pike that comes in my boat is getting bonked, filleted, and fried, if its from a kawartha lake.  Sorry for caring.  S."
789105,Sinker,2013-05-29 14:44:00,8692,"I'm not saying to kill them for the sakes of killing them, I'm saying kill them and eat them!  S."
789144,fishnsled,2013-05-29 17:12:00,3520,"It's not just Balsam either being affected by the pike.  Careless anglers have been throwing them over the dam at Coby into the head waters.  Reports of them being caught on Cameron and from the report that MJL posted it is much wider spread.   (Pigeon and Scugog) Worth a read.  http://www.mnr.gov.on.ca/stdprodconsume/groups/lr/@mnr/@letsfish/documents/document/264328.pdf  I've been told by the MNR when stopped on Balsam in the past to kill all pike caught.  Now I haven't been stopped in few years out there so I'm not sure what they would say today.  Too bad your original post got off topic, and congrats on a great day.  There are some very good points being brought up on this invasive species though."
788591,beagle dad,2013-05-26 21:56:00,224,high winds chilly morning and fish eating  went out early lake was rough picked Cpl areas worked them hard with hair jigs. took a little to zero in on the fish 11-14 ft was the key.. crazy thing was not only walleye in that depth but also bass and pike..in numbers..bass not on nests or even spawned out yet. both lm and sm all fished released as walleye were not big enough or small enough (balsam slot) none the less numbers are very encouraging for the future of this lake
788592,davey buoy,2013-05-26 21:59:00,5505,That's always good to hear! Sounds like a fun day!

788746,davey buoy,2013-05-27 23:54:00,5505,I understand that. There still seems to be a good variety of other fish as well. What can you do once a invasive fish gets in and gets a good hold.Same can be said about other lakes and different species of fish taking over that were not there at one time.
788760,beagle dad,2013-05-28 01:12:00,224, who knows whats next
788762,beagle dad,2013-05-28 01:17:00,224," I suppose you believe walleye,musky lm and sm bass are all native to the kawarthas imo we will just have to work with what we get..the big problems seem to be when we try to control the fisheries"
788783,Sinker,2013-05-28 02:09:00,8692,I didn't say anything about native species. What I'm saying is I think a musky fishery is more valuable than a pike fishery.  S.
788826,Harrison,2013-05-28 12:01:00,2202,I hope Balsam does not go the way of Crowe Lake where pike KILLED the musky fishery.  Sinker is right. Snot rockets on Trilakes or Rice would suck. Great for the tackle store though.
788849,BITEME,2013-05-28 15:09:00,1968,Im curious how people think pike should not be in the Kawarthas Its not like locks are going to keep them from traveling. as far as balsam goes they have been in there a long long time I remember when i was a kid fishing with my uncle you would get the odd one and really nice walters at that time Muskie was the bad guy in there and i dont agree the muskie fishery is of more value then pike or any other fish in the kawarthas. Each has its place and nature and evolution will sort it out.  Peter
788862,glen,2013-05-28 15:38:00,2641,"Musky are way more important then catching 3lb pike.  There are thousands of lakes where you can go catch a 3lb pike.  How many lakes are there were you can catch a 10lb or larger musky. Lets vote. Who would like to catch a 3lb pike?  Now who would like to catch a 10lb or larger musky? To figure out what is going to happen to all of the K lakes look at what has already happened.  Canal, Mitchell, Crowe and others are reported snot rocket lakes. With fewer muskie all the time. The votes just came in.  People want better muskie fishing on more lakes."
788865,Fisherpete,2013-05-28 15:55:00,1814,"As others have mentioned,pike have been in Balsam for a long time already. I have been catching them there for almost 10 years, and heard about them in there before that. It is way beyond the stage where keeping and or killing any pike catches will impact the population in the lake. I have caught pike there in numbers, and of good size out of Balsam (up to 39""), as well as many tigers (biggest 41"") which are truly a beautiful fish. Tigers up to 51"" have been caught in Balsam already, so again that is a testament to just how long pike have been in there. If the muskies are slow on any given day, I have several go-to pike spots that always give up a few - which keeps things interesting.  In the past few years, my fishing partners and I have also continued to catch good numbers of muskies, including many smaller ones - so muskies are still successfully reproducing in Balsam. Will Balsam end up like some of the other lakes that have been overrun by pike? Maybe, but I don't think that is anywhere in the near future, or anything that anglers can really control. I say just enjoy the fishery for what it is today and leave the species control processes to experts like the MNR and MCI.  One more note... big muskies like hammer handle snacks  Pete"
788869,Rich,2013-05-28 16:09:00,3927,"This is the kawarthas were talking about. Per capita, they have the smallest muskies on average. Most are in the 30"" range. So ... Same size as pike then.  So whats the problem? There won't be EASY muskies anymore. Just big ones.  3lb pike or 3lb muskies?  What weighs more? 100lbs of bricks, or 100lbs of feathers?"
