Shortly after I started talking to Greg Mercer who's a beat reporter for the paper who covers the Panthers. He asked if I was interested in allowing him to use some of my photos for his ongoing Panthers Blog..so after talking with him we came to an agreement that in exchange for my photos he would talk to the Photo Editor to see if I could freelance for the paper.  Anyway, everything fell into place today:   http://www.therecord.com/sports-story/3252070-still-some-bite-in-this-old-panther/  FYI the paper didn't expand the photo...it's gonna be fixed lol"
