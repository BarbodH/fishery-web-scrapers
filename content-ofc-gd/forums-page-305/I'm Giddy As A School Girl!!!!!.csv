789059,Old Ironmaker,2013-05-29 08:12:00,8243,"Good for you man, I'm jealous, 4 stroke eh? I better get myself a paper route or something before I retool my rig. As soon as my piggy bank says OK it's toy time this shack of mine says oh no you don.t. Today is was a new pressure washer (which is almost fun) and another wedding invitation, goodbye new GPS! My neighbours and friends told me my old washer was acting up."
789060,Terry,2013-05-29 08:59:00,14456,nice  I know just how you feel

789165,RangerGuy,2013-05-29 19:59:00,564,"What boat are these (tools, wife might read lol!) goin on?"
789209,DRIFTER_016,2013-05-29 23:24:00,10439," No wife to worry about. They are going on ""The Subhunter Too"" my 1991 Fisher SV-18-GT that I bought new 22 years ago. The boat's rated for up to 125hp.      "
789227,DRIFTER_016,2013-05-30 00:25:00,10439,Just got confirmation that my goodies have left on the truck North bound.
789426,RangerGuy,2013-05-30 20:18:00,564,"Right on!  I remember seeing one of those new at the boat show. Probably about 20 years ago they looked awesome, I always wanted one but couldn't afford it back them lol!  Congrats again on the toys! She should fly with that motor! You'll love the mileage.  I would fill my 12 US gallon tank and bring 2 25litre cans with me on a long weekend with my old 89 60hp and run out on the last day.  Now I fill my 19 US gallon tank and come home with a 1/4 tank!!! On my 75 Yamaha and I actually have an extra 60lbs dog and adult in the boat the last 2 trips..4 strokes rock!"
