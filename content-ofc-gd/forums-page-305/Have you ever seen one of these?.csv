785823,dhickey,2013-05-11 03:35:00,1038,I came across a 25 cent note(paper) Its dated January 2 1900. Dominion of Canada Authorized by R.S.C. Car.31. Ottawa.  It looks real and is in good shape.  ??????? What do I do with this?  Don.
785824,DRIFTER_016,2013-05-11 03:42:00,10439,It's worthless. Send it to me. Take it to a coin/note collector for appraisal. Seems they can be worth varying amounts.  http://www.imaginaire.com/indexv2.jsp?buildResult=false&changeLangue=true&langue=en&&url=/recherchev2/avance2.jsp&cat1=MO&cat2=BC&cat3=25&buildResult=false

790341,Floren Lukatsky,2013-06-04 12:50:00,23,"i cant see a picture, not sure if you posted one or not.  i collect quite a bit. depending on its condition it can be worth from $100 to $400 for the 25 cent note.  gold coins ar only worth whatever it weighs in gold unless its extremely rare which isnt often."
