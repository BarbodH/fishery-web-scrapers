790001,RJackson,2013-06-02 19:05:00,113,"Since I began doing a bit of guiding 3 years ago it's been a really rewarding experience, but every now and then a day on the Lund is a little bit more special compared to others....  This past Tuesday I had two blind anglers aboard, Lawrence from the http://blindfishingboat.com/ and his buddy Dirk in the photo below is from Alabama and had high hopes of knocking Lake Trout off his ""fish bucket list"".  Watching these two fellas jig for lakers was a treat.  They needed very little assistance other than depth we were fishing and where the fish were in the column.  Dirk set into this one hard and played it like a pro.  Laying it down in front of him so he could ""see"" it with his hands may be the neatest things that has ever happened in my boat.     What a treat.  RJ"

790009,Chappee,2013-06-02 19:57:00,10,"Great stuff RJ I guess the sayin holds true ""even a blind man could catch a laker on the B.R."" We have boated 22 in two morning fishes since opening."
