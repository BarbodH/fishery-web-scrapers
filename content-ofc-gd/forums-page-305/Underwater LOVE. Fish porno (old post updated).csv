LOL...Hero 3 Black Edition.....what a pain in the arse it has been....really buggy....loads of issues....no battery life....freezes up.......finally the firmware update seems to have solved some of the issues.....but now it gets too hot to touch.....not good for my very expensive 64gb Class 10 sd card.       Yup....it has its own waterproof case, i need to work out how to mount it somewhere in the boat.       I think i'll stick to walleye and trout ....but might get a couple next year for the smoker...heard they aint bad."
