It was delivered a week ago but since we had some renos going on we asked the delivery guys to not take the packaging off. Today the renos were finished so I unwrapped the sectional pieces. Try as I might I could not get the pieces to fit in a way that made sense to me. We figure one of the end pieces must be the wrong one.  Head to Sears and it turns out that there should have been another piece that we needed for the configuration that we wanted but the sales person didn't include it on our bill. A manager says sorry and the missing, unbilled, piece will be delivered this Saturday. No charge. On sale, this piece is $699 plus tax, plus delivery.  We are very happy customers and will shop there again."
788789,Old Ironmaker,2013-05-28 04:18:00,8243,That must one big missing piece for $699.00. I wouldn't want to be the guy that sold it to you. The manager must be really happy with them.
788813,Terry,2013-05-28 08:55:00,14456,good to hear some good customer service
788829,outllaw,2013-05-28 12:23:00,1232,sears canada is well known for warranty and satisfying customers. glad you had a great experience. customer relations from un-named other stores can be a nightmare

788842,craigdritchie,2013-05-28 13:54:00,1586,Sears (and The Bay) are well known for providing over-the-top customer service. That's why they're still around after all these years. Can't go wrong dealing with them.
789598,kickingfrog,2013-05-31 18:47:00,8333,"Surprisingly the piece isn't that big.  We were thinking the same thing about the sales person. It was a bit confusing because it was a sectional that we needed to get the mirror image of the floor model.  It's easy, just throw the bills in the garbage when they some in.  And anyway the house and the boat were used.  And we will be shopping there again, once we pay for some of this stuff. I need a ""man's"" recliner and a tv for the rec room. I saw a video of a recliner that has a keg in the bag and the beer cup fills up from the arm of the chair, but that's what kids are for no?  Found the video: http://gizmodo.com/5988791/i-cant-wait-to-sit-in-this-chair-thatll-fill-up-my-beer-from-the-bottom"
