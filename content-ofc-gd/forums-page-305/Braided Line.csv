789353,aero_ball,2013-05-30 15:13:00,19,Rapala Carbide Pro Pliers - up until it jumped overboard on me last year.  Now I'm considering a set of P Line Adaro. Haven't decided whether to go with the Sparrowhawk or regular straight model though.
789359,Sinker,2013-05-30 15:53:00,8692,Lighter or a cigarette works for me. I like to melt the tag end so it will never slip thru if I tie a weak knot too.  S.

789437,davey buoy,2013-05-30 20:56:00,5505,I carry a lighter. that flame to melt the tag end doesn't hurt. A friend has that battery operated element .That works well!
789444,Rich,2013-05-30 21:35:00,3927,What? This is an issue for people? I use nail clippers... Been using the same pair for 3 seasons. Always used em on mono. Now I use them on braid. Works fine.
789445,Rich,2013-05-30 21:37:00,3927,"When I forget the clippers, my swiss army scissors, my pliers and my lighter.. i use the edge of a rock."
789446,davey buoy,2013-05-30 21:39:00,5505,"lol,we all get it done one way or another. Some of the ideas are great!"
789490,Lape0019,2013-05-31 01:47:00,647,Just bought a boomerang clip tonight!!! That thing works great!!
788732,sofabed,2013-05-27 23:23:00,119,What do you use to cut braided line? I have been using the berkley line cutter but find it does not last very long and would like to find a different tool to use.
788734,Lape0019,2013-05-27 23:28:00,647,"Wire cutters or really sharp scissors works best for me.  When you are saying the Berkley product, are you talking about the one that cuts or the one that acts like a soldering gun?"
788736,Rich Clemens,2013-05-27 23:35:00,3131,Sharp knife
788738,fishindevil,2013-05-27 23:37:00,6254,I use special scissors that are made by rapala and they are for cutting braid they work great and I think they were only $12 I have a few sets and they last and are durable ... At least in my opinion anyways
788739,sofabed,2013-05-27 23:37:00,119,I use the one that heats up like a soldering gun.
788741,sofabed,2013-05-27 23:39:00,119,Fishindevil Where did you get the rapala scissors? 
788744,Dave Bailey,2013-05-27 23:49:00,1641,"Despite being told it won't work, I used nail clippers, and they work fine. Press as you normally would, and then pull the line sideways between the cutters."
788747,salmon,2013-05-28 00:24:00,334,kids safety scisscors. Do not laugh until you try it.
788748,kickingfrog,2013-05-28 00:27:00,8333,I've used the scissors and they work fine but last year I bought something called snips and I like them. There a little less bulky than the small scissors.  http://www.tackletour.com/reviewboomerangsnip.html
788749,Dontcryformejanhrdina,2013-05-28 00:30:00,535,I just use my fillet knife. Slices right through it.

788792,Old Ironmaker,2013-05-28 04:26:00,8243,"Must be very sharp choppers Moose.  I use my wifes best nailclippers. Then when they wear down I tell her I found her nail clippers. I have a black multi tool that has sharp clippers on them and a hook for carbuncklements from baitcasters. I think someone left them in my boat, they are the best I have found for all lines and they were free other than the $150.00 of fuel and everything else that goes with owning a boat.."
788807,mike rousseau,2013-05-28 06:21:00,4661,Knife...
788809,sauce,2013-05-28 06:25:00,219,A sharp knife and always remember to leave yourself a couple inches tag so you have something to grip when cutting.

788827,Fish4Eyes,2013-05-28 12:16:00,1022,"I use the braid specific scissors that Bass Pro sells for 3-4$. Work great, have comfortable handles and stay sharp after prolonged use."
788831,Harrison,2013-05-28 12:25:00,2202,Musky/Pike teeth or Zebra Mussels. They slice it like butter!  Someone should market a cutter based on one of those.

788839,Fang,2013-05-28 13:28:00,1330,Dollarama sells a pair of scissors that has the word TITANIUM on the blade. These work great for cutting braid and don't seem to wear out too bad. I bought one pair and tested them out in the garage with great results. Went back on the next trip to Dollarama and bought 4 more.
788852,adempsey,2013-05-28 15:13:00,1498,"I have the special braid scissors, but find a sharp knife works just as well.  I've used regular kitchen scissors as well, as long as I treat it like it's a knife and not a pair of scissors."
788960,sofabed,2013-05-28 23:04:00,119,Thanks for the suggestions I will check some of them out
