790196,porkpie,2013-06-03 20:09:00,2521,"Fluoro as a main line is crap, fantastic for leaders, and all of my braid rigs with a few exceptions for trolling or fishing heavy cover have a couple feet of Fluoro lead.  But as a main line, forget it!"
790198,Dan668,2013-06-03 20:37:00,1120,"Fluoro for everything but frogs and flipping. Sunline, works great."
790252,lookinforwalleye,2013-06-03 23:02:00,4399,"Flouro  been there done that never again, Trilene XL for spinning gear and big game for the baitcasters= no issues. Tried a lot of expensive gimmick lines from various mfg over the years and I always end up going back to Trilene."

789747,davey buoy,2013-06-01 08:26:00,5505,"What size braid do you recommend?,still using a fluro leader Bill as well?."
789751,MCTFisher9120,2013-06-01 09:16:00,3761,"Still have to try that, I was impressed with Seguar Senshi when I fished it. But also hear good things about Sunline, there Fluorobarbon is #1 and there braids are pretty nice too."
789761,BillM,2013-06-01 10:42:00,17367, I run 6lb Nanofil to 8lb Drennan Mono for shot line then usually 4-6lb flouro for a leader.
789763,fishindevil,2013-06-01 10:49:00,6254,Trilene big game is great line !!!! Have been using it for 20yrs !!!! The great thing about big game is you can always drop down a size and not usually have to worry its tough and stands up great especially for trolling I find !!!! But as Brian said aka misfish I used ande line for years too and it was always great too ....
789764,Rich,2013-06-01 10:51:00,3927,"It was when I hooked a 5lb brown on 8lb big game, he wrapped around a tree and I brought both the tree and the fish to the bank, that I realized thats some dang tough stuff!"
789853,Burtess,2013-06-01 21:09:00,901,"Another vote for Ande here, always consistent and never any issues with it.  Burt"
789904,NANUK,2013-06-02 01:52:00,797,"The only reels I use mono are my downrigger reels, and the best line I found for that is P-Line CXX Extra strong. Almost  everything else I use braid."
789910,BillM,2013-06-02 02:03:00,17367,I run 17lb Big Game on my riggers..   Cheap and it does the job.
789913,dhickey,2013-06-02 03:20:00,1038,XL And don't kiss a smelly fish. Couldn't resist...
789915,Sinker,2013-06-02 03:59:00,8692,I run big game on the riggers too.  For ultra light pannies I've been using P-line Fluoroclear. Good stuff!  I use braid for just about everything else.   S.  S.
789949,Lape0019,2013-06-02 13:19:00,647,"Another vote for but game!!!!  I have tried suffix as well and it was way too stretchy so I missed a few hook sets. Went back to bug game and all is good. It is cheap compared to other products, but if it works, I am not changing."
789960,FloatnFly,2013-06-02 14:16:00,1640,"seagaur abrazX $22 but its very good especially on a pin  i would not reccomend braided line for a main line pin setup, as braid will eventually sink"
789966,Leecher,2013-06-02 15:06:00,7832,"Trilene XL as well... and XL Armor Coated is good too, both very strong line"
790052,porkpie,2013-06-02 23:39:00,2521,"Trilene  XL on spinning rigs and my float reels,  XT on casting rigs.  I have several casting rigs that get tuff line, and several spinning rigs that get nanofil, but my mono usage is consistently trilene!"
790059,Ainsley,2013-06-03 00:30:00,142,What is everyone using their mono rigs for? I only use it floating or for topwaters. Otherwise I'm throwing floro.
790078,Moosebunk,2013-06-03 01:49:00,3970,Maxima Ultragreen for floatfishin'.  Found it great this spring but poor in colder fall weather.  Pretty well use braid/floro for everything else.  Do chuck the odd spinner from the float-tube using a mono set-up.
790079,Lape0019,2013-06-03 01:50:00,647,I use it on one rod only. The rod is my spinnerbaits/buzzbait rod. I prefer the stretch of it for both Techniques.  I use mostly braid but I am trying a mainline floro for a crankbait/jerkbait rod this year.
790153,Dabluz,2013-06-03 15:58:00,701,"There are a good bunch of monofilaments on the market.  I have been using Berkley Sensation(clear) for a number of years now and I really like it.  It's not a monofilament but a copolymer line.  Trilene XL is still a great line.  It's elasticity makes it a very forgiving line.  I would match it with a long stiff rod and use it for short line situations.  4 lb test Nanofil does cast further than 4 lb mono but it is not as forgiving as mono.  I've used both Nanofil and mono during the same day of fishing and fishing results were similar so even though Nanofil is white, the 4 lb test is thin enough to not bother the fish.  I have to retie my hook more often with the Nanofil.  I'm giving fluorocarbon another try.  It's Berkley 4 lb test Trilene professional grade.  It's a tad thinner than 4 lb test Sensation at .007"" and it is a bit weaker when I break it with my hands.  It still is stronger than 2 lb test mono that I often use.  So far, I've had terrible results with fluorocarbon line and I kind of regret buying the fluorocarbon pro grade.  If it's as good as 3 lb test mono.....I will use it when I want a sinking line.  Yes....Berkley Big Game is strong but it is also larger than other lines of the same weight class.  Might as well use Original Stren which is the same size but much cheaper and limper than Big Game.  The reason that Stren is so cheap is due to the fact that it has more irregularities throughout it's length.  However, never below the marked weight class.  It's hard to find clear Stren.  I only use clear lines unless it's a braid or a fused line.  We have to be careful of what we buy and not get carried away by advertising and opinions from people who don't even look closely at the packages.   There are monos, copolymers, fluorocarbon.  Some lines are harder than other lines but with the hardness comes the loss of manageability, increased memory and loss of casting distance.  All lines touted at being stronger than others just have a larger diameter....no mystery there.  When using very fine clear lines, I have seen no difference in catch results between monos, copolymers, fluorocarbons, braids or fused lines.  Another thing....fused lines are thinner than braided lines."
790154,Dabluz,2013-06-03 16:12:00,701,To add a bit of spice to the discussion......I hate fluorocarbon.....even though I am going to try out some Berkley 100% pro grade in 4 lb test.  I've tried a few different fluorocarbon lines over the years and I have had terrible results.  Yes....I can tie my own knots and I know many of them and I use them all when I need to use them.
790167,BillM,2013-06-03 17:47:00,17367,"Not a fan of flouro as a main line either.  Tried it once, was quickly removed and tossed in the garbage."
790179,Angler management,2013-06-03 19:17:00,280,
790183,Ainsley,2013-06-03 19:26:00,142,What are you guys using floro on and for? I use the larger diameters (10-15lb) on my bait casters and really like it over standard nylon mono.
790190,Angler management,2013-06-03 19:37:00,280,"I only used it for high clarity water when targeting eyes. Usually 10-12lb test. And would never put it on my baitcaster again. I dont know why, but cant go a dozen casts without getting a nest."
790192,davey buoy,2013-06-03 19:49:00,5505,Agreed!That's why most of us love braid on a baitcaster. I would never change line on them.IMO.
789582,bigcreekdad,2013-05-31 16:43:00,546,What is the thinnest and strongest 8-20 pound mono you have used?
789586,bare foot wader,2013-05-31 17:28:00,1354,"i've been a trilene person my whole life, I like sensithin...recently started using spiderwire ultimate mono (can't quite remember if that's the exact name right now) and am pretty impressed with it"
789588,mike rousseau,2013-05-31 17:29:00,4661,"I don't know about thinnest... But the strongest toughest mono I know is Berkeley ""big game""  It's a great price... Like 8-10$ for a 1/4lb spool....  And tough as nails... I drag it across rocks... Muscles... And get lots of accidental musky on it and it does very well...  Very stiff... if your putting it on a spinning reel it's not the best..."
789589,Joeytier,2013-05-31 17:38:00,3990,Yep...big game and xt are great for baitcasters...super tough.  I run XL on my spinning reels...ive yet to find a lighter mono I like more.
789596,Roy,2013-05-31 18:32:00,13728," 8lb mono runs anywhere from .008"" to .012"" in diameter. XT is one of the thinnest at .008"". I use XL on spinning reels as well."
789599,musky_hunter,2013-05-31 18:48:00,328,Sunline Super Natural Mono... best i've used and cheap ! $10 for a 330 spool
789601,davey buoy,2013-05-31 19:00:00,5505,Wonder how good for float fishing?.The price is right!
789609,bigcreekdad,2013-05-31 19:39:00,546,I will be using it on spinning reels
789617,Ron,2013-05-31 20:16:00,1683,Trilene XL for me thanks. Never had problems with the stuff so I have had no need to try something else.
789619,brkygetr,2013-05-31 20:31:00,425,"Said it before and I will say it again... Ande... No idea how thin it is, but married to right rod and real combo it is outstanding.  I will however back the XT for abrasion resistence....you can bang that stuff on anything and it still holds up. Just not as subtle as the Ande."
789621,Ainsley,2013-05-31 20:33:00,142,I picked up some sunline super natural to try this year.  Haven't even spooled it yet but I'm looking forward to using it for topwaters. In the past I've used XT or silver thread.
789624,snagged,2013-05-31 20:41:00,67,Suffix siege has never let me down. More supple than Berkeley IMHO
789625,wkimwes,2013-05-31 20:42:00,76,"I agree, I used big game back when I use to use Mono as my main line more."
789631,young_one,2013-05-31 20:55:00,620,Sublime supernatural! Thinnest for the same lb rating.

789670,Rich,2013-05-31 23:40:00,3927,"Trilene XL Armor Coat is up there, but I usually use Berkley Big Game and it's pretty darn tough."
789675,BillM,2013-06-01 00:02:00,17367," If you want a good mono for your float rig, get some Drennan Super Speciallist Super Mono.  Although you should just run Nanofil/braid instead   Once you do, you'll never go back."

789688,Muskieman,2013-06-01 00:34:00,2472,Trilene XL on my spinning outfits and Trilene XT on baitcasts ... no problems ever .
789696,hirk,2013-06-01 00:57:00,571,"I have not used every mono out there but I think stren magnathin is still after all these years and new mono lines the best for combining limpness, diameter, stretch and abrasion resistance all rolled into one."
789701,danc,2013-06-01 01:15:00,4677,I think it's safe to say that mono has come a long way. It seems that everyone is happy with their choice. And that's a good thing.
