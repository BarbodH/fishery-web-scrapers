I couldn't believe they would still be spawning in these temperatures but they were , strange spring indeed ! I won't give exact location but will say they were in a small trib. of the Notty and a looong way from the bay . Here are a couple pictures .    "

789711,danc,2013-06-01 02:24:00,4677,Got a few spewing eggs last weekend. But I've also got them in early July doing the same. Water temps dictate when they are ready and I fish perhaps the coldest system on all of the great lakes.
