On water around 7:30, and within the first hour I had a lot of action with 4 pike and a handful of stupid bass who couldn't see the heavy black wire leader.My buddy, not so much action, had to wait til later on to remove the skunk later on with a few pike and aggressive bass. I couldn't stop the fish from hitting, even catching a 12"" crappie when I switched lures, dropped it overboard and set my rod down to put away the previous lure and grab a drink. I notice my rods moving, pick it up, and I have a crappie on.Finished the day with 8 pike between the two of us, including a 34.25"" which was my last fish of the day and a bunch of largies all released including an 18-19"". Left around 6:00 when it decided to just keep raining.Spinnerbaits were the lure of the day, willow leaf, hatchet/fluted, and inline mepps in both natural and florescent.  All pike were kept and were delicious."

789324,mattyk,2013-05-30 13:26:00,2110,Looks like the pike have taken over Mitchell Lake.
789340,Rich,2013-05-30 14:08:00,3927,"Send the people of norfolk county to the kawarthas, give them a month they'll wipe out your pike.  Nice catch. Looks like a great day with tasty results!"
789360,glen,2013-05-30 15:57:00,2641,Great report.  You got them dialled in.
789381,jbailey,2013-05-30 16:56:00,866,"that last pike is ugly as hell, good job though! makes me want to get out there and slay a few gators!"
789470,Rizzo,2013-05-31 00:27:00,4754,nicely done! Keep em all
789527,Toronto_Angler,2013-05-31 11:40:00,698,Crazy how quick the pike took over. When I started on this board a few years ago pike in the kawarthas was just an ugly rumor!
789529,Rich Clemens,2013-05-31 11:55:00,3131,"Sweet.     Two weeks from today, I start my season at Lakair.     Can't come soon enough - I'm in the mood for some teeth"
789530,Rizzo,2013-05-31 11:56:00,4754,"I've fished Balsam for years. 7 or 8 years ago pike were a rumor, maybe 3 years ago I got my first, now I get one every time and I'm usually using some serious sized baits not husky jerks or 3/8 ounce spinnerbaits!"
789630,wkimwes,2013-05-31 20:50:00,76,Nice catches.  Sounds like it was a fun day!
