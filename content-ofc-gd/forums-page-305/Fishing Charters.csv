As of right now, not 100% sure of what species... so I'm guessing Lake Ontario for Salmon/Trouts or Lake Erie for Wallys. Can anyone recommend any charters for either? I'm leaning towards Salmon, since I can't really get out for salmon on a regular basis... but I can get out for walleyes... then again I hear Erie has some beastly walleyes. Decisions, decisions... Anyhow, any ideas are greatly appreciated."

790021,Old Ironmaker,2013-06-02 20:39:00,8243,"Call Steve Hardcastle at Fishmasters in Dunnville. He just got a new bigger boat and is doing very well on Ontario this spring. He brings the boat back to Erie for walleye in the summer. I know of no one that has had any complaints. He has done a few TV shows with Charlie Wray and the guys from Fish'n Canada.  He is a contributor on this board.  This is his latest post here,  http://ontariofishingcommunity.com/forums/index.php?s=e7d3af71a64f83afef4aefcdf27712d0&showtopic=69616"
