Surprisingly no black flies to be found. Last weeks heat must have put a beating on them. First night sleeping in my Jungle Hammock and it was great I don't think I've ever been as comfortable sleeping while I camped. Started off the day using my 6 foot 4 weight custom cane flyrod and had a 13"" smallmouth nail a muddler.WOW what a battle on that stick.Definitely going to have to revisit it come opener of bass. No photo of said smallmouth, cuz, u know, OOS and Homey don't play that game.  Despite surface temps of 61 degrees fishing was tough and I ended up switching back to spinning gear. This was my best fish of the day    Another shot of fish.      Gave up around 1 PM and came back home.  Cooler temps through the week next week could extend speck season right through next weekend for me.  Feeling great by the way and determined to fish my brains out till I croak."
