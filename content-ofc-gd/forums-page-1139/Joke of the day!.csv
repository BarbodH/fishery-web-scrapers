120037,Joey,2007-10-02 17:11:00,9122,"A Mountie pulled a car over on the Trans Canada about 2 miles west of Winnipeg.  When the Mountie asked the driver why he was speeding, the driver answered that he was a magician and a juggler and he was on his way to Brandon to do a show that night at the Shrine Circus and he didn't want to be late.  The Mountie told the driver he was fascinated by juggling, and if the driver would do a little juggling for him then he wouldn't give him a ticket.  The driver told the Mountie that he had sent all of his equipment on ahead and didn't have anything to juggle.  The Mountie told him that he had some flares in the trunk of his patrol car and asked if he could juggle them.  The juggler stated that he could, so the Mountie got three flares, lit them and handed them to the juggler.  While the man was doing his juggling act, a car pulled in behind the patrol car.  A drunk, good old boy, driving through from Alberta got out and watched the performance briefly. He then went over to the patrol car, opened the rear door and got in.  The Mountie observed him doing this and went over to the patrol car, opened the door and asked the drunk what he thought he was doing.  The drunk replied, ""You might as well take me to jail, cause there's no freakin` way I can pass that test."""
