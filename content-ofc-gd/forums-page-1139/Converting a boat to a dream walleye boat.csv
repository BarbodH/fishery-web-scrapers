119276,DonC,2007-10-01 01:02:00,36,My oldest brother for our annual brother's French River trip took a new Lund 18 foot SSV and converted it to his notion of what a dream fishing boat for him would be.  It worked great.  4 of us brothers fished the French this year in it.  Here is the boat and his story on how he did it.  http://www.correllconcepts.com/boat_conversion.htm  Don C
119283,silveradosheriff,2007-10-01 01:13:00,1025,Nice work! Where is the console? (Just kidding).  :-)
119307,Mike the Pike,2007-10-01 02:03:00,3421,Well thanks Don for sharing that I own the same boat but I have a full bench instead of a split bench for the widest seat.I plan on tricking this boat out now I have lots of ideas.    MTP
119365,Roy,2007-10-01 11:12:00,13728,"Very impressive, Don. Really fine work."
119366,pigeonfisher,2007-10-01 11:18:00,696,"That is impressive.  If you could find a way to do it for less than $15,000 per boat you could likely find buyers.  18' with motor and all accessories for $24,000???  is that in the right range?"
119369,solopaddler,2007-10-01 11:28:00,8605,"Hey that's awesome! I can relate as well, I did a very, very similar conversion to my 16' Lund SSV."
119376,Beans,2007-10-01 12:00:00,3339,"Wow !!!...I'm impressed...especially like those rod holders...should work in the ""Tin of Beans""...Thanks for posting..."
119398,Terry,2007-10-01 12:42:00,14456,great job
119444,spooner_jr,2007-10-01 14:14:00,193,"Your brother has given me a bunch of ideas for my own boat.  One question: Did he remove the foam floatation from under the seats entirely, or move it to a different part of the boat?"
119484,DonC,2007-10-01 15:23:00,36,"Spooner, My brother John can answer you question.  Contact him at [email protected] Thanks, Don"
119485,POLLIWOGG,2007-10-01 15:23:00,835,I like that he can change the seating from the pedestal and lower them. If you take a boat rated for four and change to higher seating the rating would change to less people because of raising the center of gravity.
119508,Golfisher,2007-10-01 16:43:00,586,"Very, very impressive.  Gives me all kinds of ideas, too, but I can't even hammer a nail straight.  LOL."
119512,Fishnfiend,2007-10-01 16:54:00,357,Pretty slick indeed!  About the only thing it doesn't have is a brass pole for when the ladies entertain during a slow bite.
119671,DonC,2007-10-01 23:18:00,36,"Here are my brother John's reply to 2 questions.  Reply to spooner – post #9  All of the in-seat (or under-seat) flotation was left in place – no need to remove any of it.   ---------------------------------------------------   Reply to Pigeonfisher – post #5  Here’s the cost breakdown for the entire rig (Spring 2006, U.S. dollars, including tax): 4250	Lund SSV-18 450	Lund boat cover 200	Cover support bows/hardware 1800	EZ Loader trailer 7500	Evinrude E-TEC 60 hp 370	Three Cabela’s AGM 12v batteries 160	Pro Sport 20 plus battery charger 800	Minn kota Powerdrive trolling motor 800	Two Humminbird sonars 60	Two 6-gallon fuel tanks 500	Four Tempress seats 300	10 stainless seat bases 100	Four 13” seat pedestals 150	Four stainless seat mounts 150	Two 3/8” sheets marine plywood 120	Deco Dot vinyl for floor (5 running yards) 1500	Hardware: extruded aluminum; stainless steel nuts, bolts, etc. (high estimate) 225	Five nets for side storage 45	Portable running lights 45	Hatch cover 50	Rule bilge pump 500	Whatever else I bought but couldn’t recall for this list $20,075  TOTAL  Although I aspired to create an affordable rig, my main objective was to create exactly the boat that I wanted. After completing the project, I saw ways to create a really nice walleye rig for about $15,000 (by coincidence, the very price that you mention). It wouldn’t be exactly the same as the above rig, but it would be similar in many ways. I’m in the process of writing an article, for posting on my website, that explains how it could be done. I expect to have it written in a few weeks."
119710,ccmtcanada,2007-10-02 00:56:00,7971,Wow...what a fantastic boat!  Carefully designed from years of experience out there.  I'm just trying to get my hands on a 14 foot tinny with a 20hp motor on it...maybe one day I can aspire to have a boat like this...wow...that's all I can say!
119760,fishindevil,2007-10-02 01:42:00,6254,Man thats one sweet walleye boat thats for sure !!!!!!   the whole story & pics are amazing im lost for words...LOL..LOL.. thanks for sharing    cheers
119795,lookinforwalleye,2007-10-02 02:31:00,4399,"I certainly admire anyone who has the skill and patience to take on such a project and the finished product has some features I wish I had on my rig but I think if you added 10-12 grand or more for labour your at 32+ grand, you can get a lot of boat for that money in the States I would guess near Pro V money."
119816,HTHM,2007-10-02 03:30:00,4082,This posting should be pinned at the top in my opinion
119825,stuntman,2007-10-02 04:08:00,96,"Wow, nice boat.  Great work, thats something to be proud of.  Maybe there should be a ""my rig"" section or album?   stuntman"
120050,DonC,2007-10-02 17:42:00,36,"Stuntman, Appreciate the sentiment. Don"
