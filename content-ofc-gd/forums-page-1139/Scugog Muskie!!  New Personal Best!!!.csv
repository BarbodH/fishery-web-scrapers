119995,fishnsled,2007-10-02 15:04:00,3520,Great fish there Cliff!  Congrats on the another PB!!!
119408,ccmtcanada,2007-10-01 12:53:00,7971,"Thanks everyone!  Had a great day out on this lake for the first time ever!  I can see how addicting these fish can be...they sure are thrilling to see in action.  Crazyhook....I knew it was 15 pounds because as I brought it out of the water, I weighed it while it was still in the net....taking into account the weight of the net of course."
119449,Guest Johnny Bass,2007-10-01 14:18:00,0,"Congrats on the personal best! We caught a fish last year that was Identical to that fish! It was 36 inches, so it grew 3 inches in one year. Not bad!!!! We caught it at the middle north end of the lake."
119471,wuchikubo,2007-10-01 14:55:00,1114,WTG Cliff on your new PB!
119473,Terry,2007-10-01 15:00:00,14456,"dang  hasn't anyone told you , you can't catch big ones all the time.......  isn't about time for those monster walleye reports.......LOL  anyway..well done again"
119502,bigbuck,2007-10-01 16:05:00,2449,Nice 'ski!!!! Quite an adrenalin rush getting one of them in the boat isn't it??!!
119503,wolfville,2007-10-01 16:12:00,396,"Congrates, Cliff.  One question though...I've always wondered whenever I see those release shot. Has anyone ever had the fish turned around and bit your hand/arm when release a muskie/pike that way?"
119504,rickster,2007-10-01 16:16:00,495,WTG Cliff that is  a beauty fish congrats on the PB
119510,Golfisher,2007-10-01 16:49:00,586,Any species that Cliff  & Bly haven't covered yet this year?  How about some Belugas?
119514,GbayGiant,2007-10-01 16:56:00,1780,"Nice job CC, great looking fish."
119515,ccmtcanada,2007-10-01 16:57:00,7971, Thanks....in talking with the owner of the marina...water levels are down 2 feet from normal....which in that lake is HUGE!!
119526,Badger Shark,2007-10-01 17:39:00,291,"Wow Cliff nice fish and really nice colours, congrats!"
119549,SlowPoke,2007-10-01 18:24:00,2984,"You know you've had a good weekend when you can say ""oh yeah and I also got a 38"" chinook"". Congrats on the PB Cliff! -Brian"
119555,misfish,2007-10-01 18:31:00,29133,Awesome report Cliff. Nice ski and what a nice king.
119594,mikeh,2007-10-01 19:36:00,824,"nice colours on that fish, congrats."
119649,Roy,2007-10-01 21:58:00,13728,Great story and great fish Cliff and Carole. Congrats to you both!
119666,Joey,2007-10-01 22:52:00,9122,"That's fantastic Cliff, way to go.  The Fish Whisperer strikes again  Joey"
119687,fishindevil,2007-10-01 23:59:00,6254,"Nice catch !!!!! well done cliff,congrats on your new PB.  ..for that muskie great pics as well...cheers"
119713,Crazyhook,2007-10-02 00:58:00,1154,nice fish Cliff!   it only gets worse from here man
119716,Minnow,2007-10-02 01:00:00,177,Congrats on the Nice Muskie! Really nice good lookin fish and I am sure you will be setting some more PB before this season is done!
119718,ccmtcanada,2007-10-02 01:05:00,7971," Well, I dont have a lot to go by for either species, but I'd have to say the salmon take longer runs, but the muskie have a more ""ferocious"" attack on the lure and seem to have more aggressive fight overall.  For excitement, I'd have to give the edge to muskie."
119786,Dutch,2007-10-02 02:16:00,831,"Pretty heavy fish for 39"" at 15 lbs.!  Must be eating good.  Great job WTG!"
119845,solopaddler,2007-10-02 08:55:00,8605,"Seems like every single report of yours there's a new personal best, LOL! Nice fish, congrat's!"
119894,ccmtcanada,2007-10-02 11:58:00,7971, The first fish I ever caught larger than a panfish was less than a year ago...so getting new PBs isn't that hard...LOL.
119945,ehg,2007-10-02 13:57:00,2666,"My first impression of photo was 'what a fat fish!'.  Congrats,  Erik"
119962,nelly,2007-10-02 14:13:00,256,"Great catch and pic there Cliff! You sure have caught alot of good size fish within the last year. You seem to have caught almost everything, maybe it time to try for a sturgeon? (LOL)"
119282,ccmtcanada,2007-10-01 01:11:00,7971,"Saturday morning, our oldest came up to us and asked if she could go to the mall with one of her friends.  We said sure...no problem.  She then asked for more money than we were going to give her...and she ended the request by saying ""I'll babysit Sunday for you so you can go fishing!!"".  Well, she knows how to get what she wants doesn't she?? LOL.  Anyhow, with our new found fishing time, Bly and I decided to head somewhere, rent a boat and see what we could bring in.  We were still looking for a decent sized muskie, so we decided on a Kawartha Lake.  We had rented boats two times before on this lake, but never caught anything....not even panfish....LOL.  We always joked that the weedline in that lake was the shore...haha.  With that in mind, we decided to rent from Island Marina, instead of the one right in Port Perry.  They were very friendly and helpful there, and they have brand new 14 foot aluminums with 9.8hp motors on them.  I had brought my trolling motor along, but ended up having not much need for it as they idled right down to a great trolling speed...and surprisingly quiet too.  As we headed off across the lake, Bly suddenly says ""Hey...STOP!! There's a weed line!!""  We couldn't believe it...an actual weed line in this lake...LOL.  We started out by trolling along this edge, but wouldn't you know it....all we caught were...well....weeds.  I then put us about 20 ft off the weedline and drifted along it.  We were throwing some spinnerbaits when suddenly I feel a pretty good weed.  I go to pull it thru the weeds and it pulls back...LOL.  I set the hook properly and suddenly the fish starts pulling drag off my reel.  It takes a few nice runs, but I didn't want to horse the fish in, so steady as she went...me gaining some ground...it pulling some drag, until finally it was close enough to net.  What a thrill it was to see this fish come in...my first decent sized muskie.  It measured in at 39"" and weighed 15 pounds...not a trophy, but my biggest muskie ever. (also only my second one...LOL).  Here's the pic.   And the obligitory release shot....   Wow...we decided to try a few deeper part of the lake (also not easy if you know this lake...LOL), without any luck, so we decide to head back to the area we had action earlier on.  We figured we'd drift a bit around the same area.  About 10 minutes later, as I'm reeling my spinnerbait, I'm lazily looking into the water.  My lure is about 3 feet from the boat when suddenly this huge shadow snakes out of the weeds below.  It startled me (or I shrieked like a school girl), so when I saw it's huge mouth take the bait, I set the hook, but the hook came right out.  DAMN!!!  I left the spinnerbait in the water and it turns and and hammers it again!!  This time I set the hook and the fun started all over again....at least until it jumped and cleared the water and spit my hook.  Wow...it was soooo close....  It was getting later in the day, so we decided to troll back to the marina for one last run.  About half way back, Bly yells FISH ON!!!  Her bait was about 150 feet off the back of the boat, so it took a long time to get this fish close to the boat.  It stayed deep and went under the boat and around the other side.  As she begins to bring it to the surface, there were a few head shakes and it spits the hook!!! ARGHHHH!!!  Oh well...at least there was some great muskie action today.  Now that we've found a place on this lake to hook into them, we'll be back a few times for sure during this fall to wrestle with them again....  Oh yeah...the other night, I went fishing...pulled this Chinook in....38"" and 19.5 pounds....(not in Scugog...LOL) "

119298,tbayboy,2007-10-01 01:50:00,1497,"Congrats Cliff!  I told you there were fish there, welcome to my world of love-hate with Scugog .  Oh and yeah by the way here's another 20lb salmon - nice throwin"

119304,Pigeontroller,2007-10-01 01:55:00,2793,"Nice fish Cliff!   Now that you have the Muskie bug, all those ""other"" fish won't seem nearly as interesting..."

119335,Toronto_Angler,2007-10-01 03:34:00,698,Good stuff CCMT! We also rented from Island Marina but didn't have much luck that day. They are a very nice couple that owns it and we would rent from them again.
119338,scuro,2007-10-01 03:37:00,386,You are on freaking fire this fall!!
119346,mikeymikey,2007-10-01 07:08:00,376,Awesome catch there...  So... Musky vs Salmon...  Which fights harder?
119347,Tarzan's Jane,2007-10-01 08:06:00,1183,Shrieking like a girl could be considered another personal best too ya know.  LOL   Great report and I have a feeling that you may be adding a new boat to the wish list...probably much easier fighting those big ones from the boat you were in.  Regardless...you two will always get the fish no matter from where or from what.  Congrats.
