119908,bigcreekdad,2007-10-02 12:36:00,546,"I think I mentioned before that I was thinking about getting a larger outboard for my Alumacraft Magnum 165. I presently have a 50 hp Yamaha 4 stroke. I noticed the specs for my boat call for a max tiller hp rating of 60 hp. Two questions:  1) Will I really get much more speed going from the 50 to the 60 ( I get max of about 29mph presently). 2) What's the danger of going beyond the 60hp rating for my boat?  Thanks in advance for any advice.  I'm still all worked up over that 54"" French River fish posted recently......I WANNA GO BACK!!"
119910,Pigeontroller,2007-10-02 12:43:00,2793,"I have a similar boat but with a console/full windshield, I upgraded from a 60hp 2 stroke to a 90hp 4 stroke and it made the boat so much more responsive!(and quicker) I don't think the 10hp difference would be worth it, unless there was another reason to change motors...Then what the heck!"
119956,OhioFisherman,2007-10-02 14:09:00,6623,"I wouldn`t spend the money for a 10hp difference, unless I was able to find a 60hp real cheap. Another thing to consider, a motor over the MFG`s recommendations might void the hull warranty?  It is hard to catch fish at 29mph, nice to get to the spots quicker though."
119966,Headhunter,2007-10-02 14:25:00,5703,"You may end up with insurance issues as well, if you over-power the boats recommended rating. HH"
119971,lew,2007-10-02 14:30:00,12767," I was given the exact same information from the Canadian Coastguard..  According to them, it's perfectly legal to overpower your boat, but if it leads to an accident, your insurance company may not cover any of the costs."
119992,EVINRUDE-DUDE,2007-10-02 15:00:00,39,HAD A GENTLEMAN PUT A 90HP 4 STROKE ON A BOAT RATED FOR 75HP AND HIS INSURANCE CHARGED HIM AN EXTRA $100 A YEAR.WORTH IT IF IT HELPS YOUR PERFORMANCE BUT LEW HAS IT RIGHT JUST BE CAREFUL.
119999,Entropy,2007-10-02 15:07:00,747,Put an Evinrude Etec (advanced 2 stroke)  60hp on it and you will notice a difference !!  Or Mercury Optimax .... do they make it in a 60 hp?
120022,Tybo,2007-10-02 16:21:00,1373,"You will get fuel economy and a couple of MPH,s. But nothing substantial.  The max horse rating is more about weight then ponies.  In most cases the next size up is usually in a different weight class."
120080,Zib,2007-10-02 19:18:00,369,It's not worth getting 10 HP more if you don't need a new motor. If the 50HP takes a dump on you then get the bigger motor.
120082,misfish,2007-10-02 19:25:00,29133,"  Yep, what Zib said."
120213,boatman,2007-10-03 02:54:00,350,You won't see an appreciable difference and overpowering your boat can be dangerous.
120214,Dondorfish,2007-10-03 02:58:00,1000,Why not look at getting a better prop for your 50 hp - one that will give you a few more mph. It would be alot cheaper then to change motors for 10 hp.  just my thinking.   Don
120259,bigcreekdad,2007-10-03 12:09:00,546,Tracker....didn't realize a different prop would do this. Can you explain and do you have any recommendations?
120266,Mike the Pike,2007-10-03 12:36:00,3421, Yup what ZIB says not worth it.My cousin has a lund classic with 50hp merc tiller top speed 35mph my buddy has the same boat side console and a 60 merc top speed 37mph thats all 2mph more.MTP
120269,didoban,2007-10-03 12:46:00,65,assuming you have the right size prop and motor is set up correctly on your boat....change to a higher pitch prop than what you have now. u go faster at top end but suffer on take off.
120273,Randy,2007-10-03 12:58:00,115,"I think it depends on how you fish. If you do a lot of trolling, it may be hard to get the trolling speed down to walleye speed if you use a big engine. Depending on your boat, you may need to go with a kicker for trolling.  I changed my motor last year and had the same dilemma. I didn't want to sacrifice low end speed for top end speed to I stuck with the same HP rating but got an e-tec."
