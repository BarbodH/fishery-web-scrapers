118885,Muskieman,2007-09-29 17:28:00,2472,found this on the Sylvanic home page from a video... video clips the guys and witnesses sound convincing...who knows?  in the reports they had a NFL athlete try to run the same course and he was unable to do it .. these guys say they will take you there for free so long as they can blindfold you ... they've offered the T>V networks ...such as discovery  and so far they refuse to go without knowing exactly where it is.  Do you beleive?
118887,ilario,2007-09-29 17:46:00,166,definitely Bigfoot
118891,sharper,2007-09-29 18:06:00,279,Can I have the link for the clip?
118892,misfish,2007-09-29 18:09:00,29133,Thats just Irishfield after his summer of non shaving. Dont be alarmed.LOL
118896,Muskieman,2007-09-29 18:24:00,2472,http://www.sylvanic.com/Media%20Page%2002.htm  here ya go.
118901,ilario,2007-09-29 19:01:00,166,"But seriously, that is ridiculous... i mean there's absolutely nothing in that tiny piece of footage that would convince any rational human that it was some undiscovered creature...  the problem with ALL of these types of clips, pictures, videos, etc is that all of them are vague, blurry and brief images.. obviouslly some people get off on trying to trick others into believing such rubbish!!"
118903,misfish,2007-09-29 19:07:00,29133,"Well after watching and listening,if I was a multy millioniar,I would pay to see this."
118968,Rizzo,2007-09-29 23:30:00,4754,"hahaha that narrator is a total buttnut.  I especially liked the part where he claims that they were ""dominated"" by this animal.  Luckily he edited out the footage when the sasquatch plays the banjo and forces them to squeal like a pig."
119048,danbo,2007-09-30 07:49:00,2646,If there was a Bigfoot somebody would've made a rug out of it by now!
119050,HIMTI,2007-09-30 10:07:00,33,"now, thats a big foot "
119079,John Bacon,2007-09-30 13:10:00,3277,"Where is proof that it is "", defenitely not a bear""?  The quality of the video is way too poor to rule out a bear, a human (he wouldn't even need a costume for a video of this quality)... it could even be squirrel.  If he studied them so much and repeatedly show that his methods are scientifically repeatable, or something to that effect, shouldn't he have something better than this to show us?"
119087,bassmastermike,2007-09-30 13:23:00,295,Looks Like someone in a halloween Ape costume!!!
119097,BFSC Kevin,2007-09-30 13:48:00,1351,i give this video a thumbs down.
119114,lunkerbasshunter,2007-09-30 15:03:00,2585,i second the 2 thumbs down!  This guy is a few cards short of a full deck.
119127,glen,2007-09-30 16:10:00,2641,Its not bigfoot its an alien.
119179,aplumma,2007-09-30 19:54:00,6896,It's T.J. Q out at camp Jiggity Jiggity Umpa Loompaville. You can tell because if you look closely you can see were the TuTu has scruffled the hair around his waist from repeativily wearing the item of clothing.   Art
119203,holdfast,2007-09-30 21:24:00,1813,"Pure Hogwash, Just like Nessie, Fake, Fake.  Yup the narrator is doing more preaching than anything.  I bet you he is the Bear-mans twin brother.  Unlike what he says, I would shoot that thing so we can study, and prove once and for-all if its legit.  Problem is Id be up for attempted murder of a nutcase in a hairy costume."
119206,Rich Clemens,2007-09-30 21:31:00,3131,Oh my god .... he DOES exist.     Anyone got a clip of the tooth-fairy ?
119228,Rizzo,2007-09-30 22:51:00,4754,"no clip of the tooth fairy, but Elvis stole a cheeseburger I had cooling on my window sill"
119236,Greencoachdog,2007-09-30 23:37:00,8163," Eggs Actley!!! I was thinkin' the same thing because I was wonderin... where have I seen that clumsey but ballet-like gait before??? > > >Then it dawned on me!!! T.J. + Lakair + ""Shine""!!!"
119881,doubleheader,2007-10-02 11:29:00,497,Much more entertaining than arguing about what is the best brand of motor or boat. Looks like a lady I dated back in my drinking days.
119913,2kj,2007-10-02 12:52:00,77,There is no question a creature call it bigfoot that has been sighted on every continent exists but I'm sorry that looks like a grizzly to me.
