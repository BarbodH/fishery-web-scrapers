119117,Tybo,2007-09-30 15:13:00,1373,Has enyone used leadcore on a inline planer board.  Was thinking of giving it a try with some 10 colour 17lb.  Will the leadcore stay clip to the board.  I have all 3 type of the clips.
119126,Sherriff,2007-09-30 16:04:00,252,"I would think it would stay clipped but may kink the lead core and may release too easily or not at all .  You can splice in some mono or braid every few colours in your 10 colour core setup for attaching the clip for the planner board, or just use a smaller core.  Eg 5 colour, 3 or 2 spooled up...  I have used a 5 colour with the boards no problems...  Sherriff"
119194,fishindevil,2007-09-30 20:36:00,6254,"yes it will stay clipped you have to use the right one,but we use leadcore for salmon & walleyes all the time and its ok,you can rig it a few ways so it wont come off,just make sure it wont rip...we have run up to 7 colors and i know guys have run 10 so you will be ok.....cheers & good-luck"
119416,Headhunter,2007-10-01 13:10:00,5703,"Hey Tybo... been running lead core off of in-line boards for a while now... 10 colours, no problem as long as you have the following; - for Off Shore boards, be sure to change the clips to the snap down locking kind -Mr. Walleye boards do not require a clip change... they work great right out of box. HH"
119425,Uncle Buck,2007-10-01 13:49:00,1000,No worries bud... works good...  i've got the offshore SST boards (red ones) and the OR-18 Snap clip (black) upfront and the red one on the back...  never had any issues with it...

120055,tonyb,2007-10-02 17:49:00,1637,"You may want to consider going to the 27lb lead instead of 17lb, that way you can also use it for spring Kings    Tony"
120088,dwc67,2007-10-02 19:45:00,140," it's pretty much the same dive curve.  you might want to get a 600ft spool of 30lb copper instead of the core. it doesn't have the same rise/dive action of core but at least you feel the fish(no stretch like braid). 270ft of copper will do what a 10 colour does and you can make a few reels out of a spool. i have a 275, 125, and a 50 for coho  my 275 rod was top rod through august out of bronte and all lengths will run on an updated clipped offshore  i freaken hate core  edit if your fishing eyes be prepared to keep fish because you will be taking them from deep water with a full core."
