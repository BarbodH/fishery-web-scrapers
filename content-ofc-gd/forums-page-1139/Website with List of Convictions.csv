I was surprised how many commercial operators were convicted, including seafood operators, restaurants, lodges, guides, and marinas.  I will not mention any names of these companies, but I'm sure some are familiar to us, and we might have been customers of their's in the past.  I suggest using their search tool to find previous criminals before dealing with these companies.  Personally, I will not be a customer to any of these companies who have harmed our natural resources."
