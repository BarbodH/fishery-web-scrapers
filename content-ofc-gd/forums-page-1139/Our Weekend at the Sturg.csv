119251,joonmoon,2007-10-01 00:23:00,528,"Well my wife and I had another enjoyable weekend at Big Cliff and Sue's. Fishing, relaxin, and good eats with great company...couldn't ask for anything more...well except maybe a few decent eyes in the boat...lol. No dig at you Cliff I know you were trying hard to get me into some last night and this morning...lol. Cliff had tinkering to do Sat and Sue had plans as well so Gus and I were left up to our own ideas to find some fish. Started out in the morning with some small perch and a cigar walleye Sat. We trolled a few areas Cliff showed us on the charts and GPS. We did find lots of these little guys...   We were able to cover a lot more of the Lake than we have fished before with use of Cliffs boat(Thanks big time), and by the time mid afternoon rolled around and no walleyes to show we decided to hit our fav Musky spot. Where I promptly after a few casts found a toothy eager enough to take my orange and black spinnerbait...he on the other hand was a little camera shy and decided to have no part in being landed by me. Rocketing himself in the air and writhing like a snake....pppppiiiittttuuuuueeee...and out flys my spinnerbait. Me laughing and smiling tipped my hat and continued to fan cast the area hard. Gus took the initiative to toss the black and gold Mepps Musky Killer bucktail recently purchased at CTC in Lindsay and moments later FISH-ON. This wasn't as big of fish as the LDR fish I played with but definitely not lacking in the spunk category. Airbourne as well and bulleting down into thick weeds until dead calm like you have snagged the cork in the bottom of the lake. As the wind drifted us farther away I sparked up the motor and reversed until we were directly over the last know spot that we saw a fish...hmmm, pretty stiff hold on the weeds I thought to myself, several yanks on the line by hand and finally it came up. A couple of pounds of fish and about 10 lbs of weeds....lol. Hand landed the little smegger, unhooked em, a few quik shots and back to the drink he went...  All the action in the first drift thru the area...then nothing until the third drift. BANG and my spinnerbait does a few flips above the surface of the lake. Nice fat Largie comes willingly to my awaiting thumb. This fish was short and chubby at 14"" he almost weighed 2.5 lbs. What a football piglet...lol...  We came back to Cliff and Sue's place around 4pm cause it was our turn to BBQ and I was hungry by then. Steaks, yams, and Gus's famous broccolli salad were on the menu...MMM. Cliff had plans to get me out in the eve to find some walleyes so we ate and ran. Jumped into the boat and zipped to the spot, his first cast bang hooks into a hyper Crappie not a bad sized one too. We thought we were in for a good eve with a start like that but...nothin doin. Rockbass was the only thing bitin my hook and we called it a night. We woke to a quite calm lake and headed out again. Same as the eve for me, rockers and a small perch. Cliff on the other hand was into some good keeper sized perch and was attempting to liven up the breakfast table but after only pickin up 3-4 keepers he decided to release them from the livewell to swim another day. Our weekend was very relaxing and we enjoyed our stay once again with Big Cliff and Sue and can't forget Andy too. Thanks alot guys cya soon."

Glad to see you got into some musky action....the orange and black has been the ticket for me on sturg so far this season as well. I haven't targetted  eyes since labour day weekend, but we did well on them then........I don't fish as much once hunting starts though.  If your heading up there again, shoot me a pm. My boat is docked just up the road from Cliffs.  Sinker"

119353,Big Cliff,2007-10-01 09:59:00,6899,"I could write a big long post about how much we enjoyed your visit but I think the best way to say it is: You guys are welcome here any time, we really look forward to your visits!  By the way, thank you again for all the chain saw and trimmer parts.  They have found a good home!  Hope you can make it back again before the season closes.  Big Cliff, Sue, & Andy"
119405,ccmtcanada,2007-10-01 12:49:00,7971,"Great report and pics!  At least you got into some nice fish there.  Sounded like you had a great time...great fishing, great friends....that's what it's all about."
119521,jediangler,2007-10-01 17:12:00,1923,"Way to go Bro, and Sis in-law. Good variety of fishes you got there. Everything but the eyes eh? By the way I've still got your cradle from the Big Jake weekend in my car. E-mail me when you're going to be home, I'll bring it over before work. I know you and Gadget are getting out later in the week and will need it."
119625,ecmilley,2007-10-01 20:30:00,2163,"better than a skunk, i had a tough go at my end of the lake as well that cold front really shut down the eyes for the weekend"
119698,Big Cliff,2007-10-02 00:39:00,6899,"Jeff, do you remember where I told you that I wanted to try? Well, I tried there tonight, first time since I moved here. 3 walleye in about 30 minutes then they shut down. Nothing big, biggest about 2.5 lbs but good eaters. Will show you if you can get back soon."
119745,joonmoon,2007-10-02 01:29:00,528,"Yup we had a good weekend. Cliff not exactly sure where you're talking? Did we fish there together? My buddy Gadget and I are headed up that way on Thurs for some Ski action, hopefully find them where Gus left em...lol. Sure would be nice to have a second angler guided by yours truly nail thier first Ski...lol. Hey Cliff I think we will have to make sure we head up your way before the end of the season to find some eyes."
119754,joonmoon,2007-10-02 01:38:00,528,Wait a minute now I know where you're talking Cliff. Good for you. Did ya try using what you use off your dock?
119852,Big Cliff,2007-10-02 09:20:00,6899,You got it Jeff!  Good luck on Thursday!
