The lake was flat and the water clear, we could see some nice pike cruising and even had a couple of good fish follow our baits but it was tough getting them to eat.  I finally got a couple of fish to hit, the first Pike ate a Perch Jointed X-Rap and the second which was a thicker heavier Pike took a large silver/black Husky Jerk. A medium twitch pause retrieve seemed to be key. The funny part was that the smallest fish we have ever caught in this area hit the largest bait, the jointed X-Rap. We had 2 very respectable fish also follow a white Kick 'n' Minnow but just couldn't get them to bite - Pictures below.  Cheers, Shaun    "
