119943,Headhunter,2007-10-02 13:53:00,5703,"A man took his wife to the rodeo and one of the first exhibits they stopped at was the breeding bulls. They went up to the first pen and there was a sign attached that said, ""This bull mated 50 times last year.""  The wife playfully nudged her husband in the ribs and said,""He mated 50 times last year.""  They walked to the second pen which had a sign attached that said, ""This bull mated 120 times last year."" The wife gave her husband a healthy  jab and said, ""That's more than twice a week! You could learn a lot from him.""  They walked to the third pen and it had a sign attached that said, in capital letters, ""This bull mated 365 times last year."" The wife, so excited that her elbow nearly broke husband's ribs, said, ""That's once a day. You could REALLY learn something from this one.""  The husband looked at her and said, ""Go over and ask him if it was with the same cow.""  UPDATE: The husband's condition has been upgraded from 'critical' to 'stable' and he should eventually make a full recovery. HH"
