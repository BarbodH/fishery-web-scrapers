They were on today, we got them on everything from jerkbaits, to spinnerbaits, to tubes and dropshots.  Even got some on my new prototype bait, you'll see it when it's ready.  We caught about 15 fish today, about 19 pounds for a tournament, not overly big for Simcoe but respectable.  Even got a n ice pike, which I havent caught to many of outside of Cook's Bay.  Threw some tourney shirts on for pictures, but it was not an actual tournament, just figured the pics would look more professional haha.  Notice the same name on both shirts haha, i might have to photoshop those later.    Cal with his spinnerbait pike.    A nice dropshot fish    Our four biggest fish of the day, all in the 4 lbs class.  Hope you enjoyed, keep readin'"
