My partner caught the 3 largest  while I brought in a few more to fill our bag of 15. for a total weight of 10.4lbs.  only to be beaten by this guy Greg Kratts, with 13+lbs. DRAT  Here we are pick up our 2nd. place prize,and also largest phish in at 1.7lbs.  A big thank you to Rocky and Don, for setting up another great Derby see you guy this comen Ice phish season   ~~~~Will be heading out again this weekend, again to tease our Yankee Cousins"
