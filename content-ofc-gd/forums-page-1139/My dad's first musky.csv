119372,mattyk,2007-10-01 11:46:00,2110,I was up in canada for a wedding and i was able to get out with my dad to go fishing for a few hours on a kawartha lake. He has never caught a musky before so it was my goal to put him onto a nice fish. After an hours fishing he was able to land this little guy. It was really exciting seeing him reel in the fish.  We let the fish go.  Picked her up on a oversized black and orange spinner bait.
