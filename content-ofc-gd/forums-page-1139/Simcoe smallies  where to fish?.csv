120129,glen,2007-10-02 22:14:00,2641,After seeing the posts about the smallies in simcoe i would like to give it a try.  I would like to launch out of alcona if the launch is free now.  Or should i go elsewhere?  Any help with a general area to fish would be great cause my boat is real slow.  That is why i dont fish simcoe much.  I can only run about 5 miles out and feel safe.  Thanks for any help.  PM if required.
