119289,Jen,2007-10-01 01:28:00,833,"It seems I come to this place to document all my firsts... Today was one of those... After dropping my first goose from the sky this week I just had to do a wild game dinner...  It truly was spectacular...  The hunting day,   From a goose that was maybe 6 pounds before it went in the oven. This is what it looked like after a couple of hours.   I was surprised how easily it came off the bone.  The kids totally enjoyed tonights meal, and only found one little piece of steel so no major complaints.   Now I think I need to get back to fishing this week... Hunting has been my focus but reading all the posts here makes me miss having my line in the water.  Cheers,  Jen"
