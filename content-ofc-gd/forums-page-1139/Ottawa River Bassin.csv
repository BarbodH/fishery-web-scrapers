119942,Seaweed,2007-10-02 13:48:00,135,  Well I finally offloaded a bunch of pictures of some river bass that I managed to entice into hitting over the past month or so... non during tournament action though unfortunately but hey that's life.  The largemouth should be fattening up out there now though so if you can get out there and wail on them..... :wink:  Chris Bass  Chris Bass   Chris Big Bass   Johnny Bass   Yet another shirtless JohnnyBass...
