119737,G-loomis,2007-10-02 01:23:00,19,HI I am looking for a good trolling motor battery from canadian tire. can you recomend a good battery.
119741,ccmtcanada,2007-10-02 01:26:00,7971,I bought this one....it's a Nautilus Deep Cycle  http://www.canadiantire.ca/browse/product_...D=1191288358707  Also bought a Nautilus dual charger as well.  I use it for a 30 pound thrust trolling motor....used it for 5 hours one time on settings varying from 3 to 5 (5 is the max) and still had 50% charge left at the end of the day.

Man did that ever confuse me when I hooked it up in the boat, couldn't figure out what I had done wrong.  Took me a good half hour before I considered the battery was the problem!"
119787,holdfast,2007-10-02 02:16:00,1813,"I also have a nautilus deep cycle and charger,  Three years now and not one problem."
119799,Pigeontroller,2007-10-02 02:42:00,2793,"Beware the dusty battery, some of them are sitting on the shelf for years, they get monthy charge ups but its better to get a fresh one! Buy one somewhere that sells alot and you will be happier..."
119810,GbayGiant,2007-10-02 02:56:00,1780,"Yes try to get a fresh one, but the Nautilus big deep cycles are good."
119820,bassfighter,2007-10-02 03:48:00,366,COSTCO - BEST PRICE SO FAR.
