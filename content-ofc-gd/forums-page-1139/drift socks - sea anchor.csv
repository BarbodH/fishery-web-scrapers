119660,jimca11,2007-10-01 22:35:00,34,Hi. Does anyone know of a inexpensive way to make a drift sock. Does the 5 gal pail with a hole cut in the bottom work? Any thoughts or ideas are welcome.
119670,Sinker,2007-10-01 23:15:00,8692,A 5 gallon bucket with no holes has worked for me in a pinch.  There is a way to do it with an Ikea bag.....someone here will know.  Sinker
119757,OhioFisherman,2007-10-02 01:40:00,6623,"Another cheap way to slow the drift down is to use old style window weights, they are about 18 to 24 inches long, made of cast iron with holes on at least one end. 3 to 5 pounds or so. A rope thru the eye and let it drag behind the boat, they are about 2 inches in diameter, smooth and will slide over the bottom in a lot of places."
119819,Garry2Rs,2007-10-02 03:39:00,1425,"Pop or milk crates will also work. To slow myself down even more, I once used a left over piece of plexiglas to cover about half of the bottom. A shingle, or a scrap of plywood would work just as well. The crates are light and strong and the handles won't pull off...grin. garry2r's"
120308,jimca11,2007-10-03 15:10:00,34,Thanks for the help. I hace drilled some holes in a 5 gal pail and will try that and I will take a milk crate too. I will let you know what works gonna try them this weekend.
