Gordy "
1018558,Sinker,2017-11-30 18:27:00,8692,"Tim Hales will do that. He always checks on the huts at noon, so if you want to leave, you should be able to no problem. He also has his huts set up for kids safety, with covers for the large holes. Best perch operator on the lake IMO.  S."
1018570,DJGeneral,2017-11-30 19:39:00,163,I use Lucky sons on cooks bay every year nice and warm huts for kids take my little niece every year with me and shes 6 now its non stop action all day and the odd keeper here and there and you can even get  pizza delivered on the ice!
1018577,Garnet,2017-11-30 20:34:00,2056,Almost all operate do a noon check. Steve's on Homes Point rd for early perch and Tim's later.
1018601,turtle,2017-11-30 23:04:00,274,"I also recommend Tim Hales, well run, organized, well maintained equipment & huts.  Plus his office has a collection of spears & decoys from the old days and fish & game mounts."
1018602,RickOnt,2017-11-30 23:12:00,669,Hey Gordy Where are ya coming from? Tim Hales out of Beaverton for the East side Terry Goy out of Gilford for the West side  Likely with a midweek trip you could dictate your hours Cheers Rick 
1018608,gordy28,2017-12-01 01:27:00,638,Thanks all greatly appreciated Rick.  Coming from Mississauga but maybe picking up folks in Markham so sounds like both spots work i have fished cooks before but never out of Pefferlaw. Cheers Gordy
1018616,Big Cliff,2017-12-01 10:52:00,6899,"Tim Hales without a doubt! Excellent service, nice huts, and he keeps them on the fish! I also like the safety covers he has for the kids (and unsteady old men )"
1018620,DanD,2017-12-01 12:21:00,2223,"I'll also chime in for Tim Hales.                                                                                                                                                   As for the safety covers; yea we used them the one time we were there. My daughter's X boyfriend, thought it was an ice drinking, not ice fishing excursion. Yup he walked right in and down to about his neck. If we weren't there to grab him; he would have been under the ice. What a dumb ass!!! Dan."
1018844,buckhorn250,2017-12-05 14:38:00,85,Im looking to do a day of Perch and another day of trout\whitefish....is there a better time of year for perch? thanks 
1018847,Garnet,2017-12-05 15:52:00,2056,For perch earlier the better I go with Steve about the earliest main lake. Dave's setup in virgina  Beach a little earlier. Them I switch to Tim's in 30+ ft off back of Thorald. I'm sure there is good operator's off the 400.
1019008,Shloim,2017-12-07 21:06:00,515,"Ive only been twice, once with Tim hales and it was fantastic, second time with another operator and it sucked in comparison, Everything was better with Hales!!! "
