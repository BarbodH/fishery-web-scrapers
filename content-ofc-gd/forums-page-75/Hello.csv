The dog and I left Bridenorth around the 10th. and travelled west on the Trent system to Georgian Bay. By October we had entered the USA and started sailing south on Lake Michigan. At Chicago we entered the Inter Coastal Waterway... The next two months were spent moving south on the ICW.  This series of rivers connects  the Great Lakes to the Gulf of Mexico. We arrived at Mobile Alabama in time for Christmas.  Dockage with power and water, showers and the use of a courtesy car was less than $300.00 a month, so we spent the winter there.    "

I just shoveled snow for the first time in 2 years, at least. Where will the winds bring you after Christmas? I guess all you have to do is point the bow in a direction and that's where you are going. Livin' the dream there Cappy. By the way what a great 1st mate you have there Garry with 2 R's. Keep those pics coming so I can warm myself up before we head to Fla."
