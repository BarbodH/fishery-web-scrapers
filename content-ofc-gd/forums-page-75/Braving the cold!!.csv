1019311,DJGeneral,2017-12-11 20:52:00,163,Got a chance to get out this weekend for some winter steelhead the weather was brutal but since i dont own a car i get any chance i get to go fishing my buddy picked me up around 1pm and we were at the river by 3pm my first time fishing this trib and its always nice to see a new place other than seeing it on youtube videos apart from the wind smacking me in the face and the trek down to the river it is was an amazing experience we decided to leave the float fishing gears at home and throw spoons and vibrax spinners instead Pink and chrome seem to be the colour they wanted that day we did pretty good going 3/4 and i decided to keep this nice steelie for the dinner table! Sorry for the blood in the picture i couldnt feel my hands to wash her off!

1019410,AKRISONER,2017-12-12 21:35:00,5558,you must not ice fish when its -20 lol
1019411,Old Ironmaker,2017-12-12 21:41:00,8243,"I was thinking you are nuts soft water fishing in this weather. Then I saw you in the pic, you aren't unbalanced you are young. Keep it up and son put on a toque. When we skied years ago it wasn't cool to wear a toque, so we all froze to death but sure looked cool with my Elvis shades on for all the young Dollies."
1019467,DJGeneral,2017-12-13 13:14:00,163,I do but thats what warm ice huts are for lol Thanks Ironmaker i will take your advice and start wearing toques when fishing in cold weather! Which might be this weekend....
