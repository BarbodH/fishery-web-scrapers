1019650,muskymatt,2017-12-15 19:30:00,2608,I finally pick up my 2018 Skidoo expedition 900 le tomorrow and am now thinking of purchasing a GPS to mount on it. Any recommendations would be great! Are there winter models that won't freeze up? Thanks
1019652,barrystrs,2017-12-15 19:37:00,75,I have been using a used garmin car gps with the snowmobile map sd card installed for about 5 yrs.  The gps plugs into a 12v outlet on the sled.  I would never ride without a gps again.
1019653,muskymatt,2017-12-15 19:39:00,2608,No issues with freezing? What is the SD card model and make? Thanks

1019726,barrystrs,2017-12-16 13:53:00,75,"The car gps has never frozen or given any problems other than an occasional bad connection where the wires plug in.  The sd card comes from OFSC, ontario federation of snowmobile clubs.  I believe you can just download the data for the maps, but a friend buys a new updated version every year and gives me his old one.  He is using a montana, the cadillac of offroad gps, but the unit and mounts were very expensive, and then you need to worry about losing it or have it stolen."
1019735,BillM,2017-12-16 16:11:00,17367,I have had a Garmin GPSMap 62 I've used for years.    Only thing I need to remember to do is carry spare batteries..  That thing has taken a beating and hasn't stopped yet.
1019789,limeyangler,2017-12-17 02:12:00,5204,"I have a 62 also, been through hell and back and still performs flawlessly. I think they are discontinued now and the latest model is the 64. You could pick the whole deal up from GPSCity for $380 taxes and shipping included in that price. http://www.gpscity.ca/garmin-gpsmap-64s-newly-overhauled http://www.gpscity.ca/ram-mount-garmin-gpsmap-62-62s-62st-mount-cradle-ram-hol-ga41u http://www.gpscity.ca/ram-mount-diamond-plate-with-1-inch-ball-ram-b-238u http://www.gpscity.ca/ram-mount-medium-arm-b-socket-ram-b-201u http://www.gpscity.ca/ram-mount-tough-claw-universal-quick-release-clamp-base-1-inch-b-ball-rap-b-400u"
