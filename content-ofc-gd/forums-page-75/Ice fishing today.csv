1019219,lickmyarmpit,2017-12-10 21:19:00,359,Hit the lake in town today for a couple hours.  It was freezing out there with a strong north wind but fish were caught.  First trip out this season decent conditions with 8 to 10 inches of ice.     
1019222,Old Ironmaker,2017-12-10 22:00:00,8243,"Way to go my man. Looks like a great spot you can walk to. Always nice to get on the ice before the New Year and a bonus to actually catch fish. I would always keep at least 1 Pike out of icy water, any fish for the table is best out of cold water. I always have to chuckle when I see those weather reports -20C feels like -30, when it hits -20 what's another 10 degrees."
1019224,Woodsman,2017-12-10 22:30:00,1286,Nice. Great to get out early. I plan on being at Temagami in just over 2 weeks.
1019225,irishfield,2017-12-10 22:46:00,26272,"Nice !! I'm just about ready to go.. but in no hurry !! LOL Woodsman, pray for lots of steady cold and no snow fall. I still can't get to my island near town and the main hub is still wide open."
1019226,Woodsman,2017-12-10 22:59:00,1286,irishfield I just got a report from a local that they are running snowmobiles down the arm from town. I stay in town with locals. With the forecasted low temps & very little snow I suspect ice will be fine by the 26th. Forecast looks great if it goes as called for. We usually fish Snake Island Lake & Cassels Lake plus Temagami at times. Also an open speck lake.
1019228,irishfield,2017-12-10 23:04:00,26272,"Should be good by then.. one of the neighbours just had to break the 2"" of ice from town right up the channel past my place last week, just when it was starting to take hold! Snake and Cassels generally tighten up before the big lake!"
1019229,Woodsman,2017-12-10 23:07:00,1286,Was good last year at that time. The year before not so. 
1019230,Woodsman,2017-12-10 23:08:00,1286,Since last week I suspect it has tightened up some.
1019246,Joeytier,2017-12-11 01:47:00,3990,"Yeah, the cold came early!"
1019254,Acountdeleted,2017-12-11 02:57:00,2562,Oh man does that get the itch going. Very nicely done.
1019258,sleepjigging,2017-12-11 03:59:00,207,Nice start. I heard that the lake in town had no fish. I guess they lied. Looks like that pike was feedn on the wallies pretty good.
1019260,Dutch01,2017-12-11 04:23:00,1431,"Super jealous right now, not gonna lie! Nice fish guys."
1019322,NAW,2017-12-11 22:21:00,4022,That's a great first outing of the year!! This saturday will be my first day on the water.  Then home to get cleaned up for the work Christmas party!  Should be a fun day!
