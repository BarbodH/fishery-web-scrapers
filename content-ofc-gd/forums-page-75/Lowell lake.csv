1019236,mrbrown95,2017-12-11 00:20:00,6,Going to Lowell Lake. ice fishing this winter 2018 has anyone fished it also what species of fish am going to get on that lake or am I wasting my time going there.
1019239,irishfield,2017-12-11 01:03:00,26272,"You talking Lowell Lake just South of Temagami??? If so Lake Trout (only open from Feb 15th to 3rd Sunday in March), Northern Pike, Small Mouth Bass (not open in winter) and perch. Mapping I have makes no mention of Whitefish or Pickerel (walleye)"
1019245,Joeytier,2017-12-11 01:45:00,3990,"Mostly small lake trout and a crack at a big pike.  If you have a sled there's some good backlake options, but you should be able to scrape up some fish on Lowell.  It's a highway-side lake with a lodge and a few camps on it, so don't expect lights out fishing, but if you know how to catch lakers you'll be able to get into a few.  Very pretty lake too."
1019249,mrbrown95,2017-12-11 02:06:00,6,Thnks same with the map I found
1019264,Old Ironmaker,2017-12-11 04:32:00,8243,Welcome aboard Mr.Brown95. It must me great to be able to get out ice fishing at your age.
1019269,dave524,2017-12-11 11:16:00,4508,maybe he was born in '95
1019341,Woodsman,2017-12-12 02:04:00,1286,Current reports I'm getting from the area state ice is forming up quite good now. Cold temps & little snow are helping out nicely.
1019344,Old Ironmaker,2017-12-12 02:30:00,8243,"I figured that Dave, just being as wise crack. When I meet an adult that says they were born in 95' I realize how old I am really getting."
1019374,Rod Caster,2017-12-12 15:25:00,5784,I put in many hours on Lowell. I caught a few small lakers... nothing of real substance. I did see a monster pike come out of there. Some nice rock cuts to slide/jump off if you have enough snow.  
1019382,mrbrown95,2017-12-12 16:26:00,6,Is it worth going there starting to rethink my trip no pickerel no white fish and no ling and the odd small laker
1019386,Rod Caster,2017-12-12 16:46:00,5784,"Rabbit lake, or Temagami, even Net Lake might be better. I'm assuming you chose Lowell because you can drive right to it... if the conditions are good, you can also drive onto Temagami and fish around the ice road. Whitefish, lakers, pickerel all  The other option is Nipissing. If you can find/get to a good spot, the fishing can be lights out awesome.. it'll keep everyone busy and entertained. Sometimes we even drive cars on the ice (exception more so than the rule) My wife and Jerpears with ling.  "
1019395,mrbrown95,2017-12-12 18:37:00,6,We chose this spot because the price was right and it was a cottage close to the fishing spot my dad gets cold easy and wants to be able to walk in if he wants is there any operators on temagemi that is recommnded
1019427,dave524,2017-12-12 23:51:00,4508,My oldest grand daughter was born that year
1019434,mrbrown95,2017-12-13 00:31:00,6,I was not not born in 95 wish I was then this cold as in cough cough would not feel so crapy I am an early 70's child
1019440,Rod Caster,2017-12-13 01:27:00,5784,Try it! There are definitely some big Lakers in there. I've just never caught them... I didn't fish Lowell a dozen times because I thought it was empty.
1019441,Old Ironmaker,2017-12-13 01:29:00,8243,"Just about the time I was off to University. As far as picking a good spot to fish, like all fishing it's a crap shoot. I have seen my sonar screen chock full of fish many times and not a single fish was had. Pick a spot and have fun with the Old Guy. Catching fish is way down the list compared to sharing quality time with your Pops. At this time in my life I would rather walk a mile than take one of those vertebrae crushing sled rides on bumpy ice for a mile.  My back is sore just thinking about it."
1019448,mrbrown95,2017-12-13 01:50:00,6,Great and sincere reply thank-you I will do that my dad did not go last year and the way he talks this might be his last so I will make it a good one fish or not.
