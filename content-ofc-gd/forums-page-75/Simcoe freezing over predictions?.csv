1019287,Shloim,2017-12-11 16:53:00,515,"Was thinking about the winter holidays, and was wondering where i can take the kids fishing with an operator besides Simcoe, that likely wont be frozen over...."
1019289,Tjames09,2017-12-11 17:09:00,664,"Forecast for the next two weeks looking really cold. I’d imagine with two weeks of solid cold weather a lot of lakes will be fairly frozen. Sturgeon is frozen as far as I can see, not sure how thick though, and that’s only 2 days."
1019290,Mister G,2017-12-11 17:36:00,1429,I hope you guys that are interested in ice fishing have a great year. I now like my ice in a glass with rum & coke......I am more interested in when is the lake gonna thaw . . . . LOL
1019292,Shloim,2017-12-11 17:54:00,515,"So here's the deal I've only been ice fishing twice, both with operators. One was Tim hales and it was great! The other was with another operator my buddy chose and it kinda sucked. Im not exactly ready to just get out there and go get em, especially with impatient kids in tow. So if theres an operator on a smaller frozen enough lake Im in!!! otherwise fairly frozen isnt grabbing me,,,,,lol"
1019293,Acountdeleted,2017-12-11 17:58:00,2562,"If you can make the drive, Bay o Quinte will be frozen."
1019330,misfish,2017-12-11 23:36:00,29133,"If there is ice over whitie grounds come Jan 1st, I,ll be on it. You wont miss me. LOL Jer, your most welcome to join me.  "
1019335,Shloim,2017-12-12 01:13:00,515,Like I said I am a complete newbie to ice fishing. But I borrowed a few rods and a bucket from a friend and even have a survival suit. So if ya ever need company or are looking to do some charity work ? Im your guy!!!
1019346,Old Ironmaker,2017-12-12 02:53:00,8243,"That can be tough fishing there. There are a few spots that hold the panfish kids love to catch but operators usually set up where the big Moma Walleye lurk. I don't see an impatient kid lasting all day without a nibble or trying to haul in a 8lb Pic. I wouldn't pick BOQ for kids. There won't be ice on Erie it looks like this year, hope so though. A place like St. Williams is the place to take a kid. The visibility can be 10 feet or more and it is in HD. Kid's love watching the fish swim by, catch or no catch. Too bad. Come on Shloim, I have a great spot to take the kids fishing in winter (you not me,), Disney World. For most working Dad's all you need to do is win the 649 first."
1019347,Old Ironmaker,2017-12-12 03:00:00,8243,"I won't be back from south until sometime in February but if you are still up to it the gang of 4 of us old fogies are  planning on a late February  early March venture north. Some of the best ice fishing is year end. You guys will be more than welcome to get a hut and tag along. Probably Simcoe. We love to get kids out fishing. I have enough ice fishing stuff to open a store, and I already donated a mess of it because I thought I was done with ice fishing, nope. Man, I'm listening to the Voice and Monday Night Football is on grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr."
1019351,Chuck Enwinde,2017-12-12 05:23:00,247,You might look into Orangeville reservoir.  The Conservation authority puts huts out.  It will certainly freeze before Simcoe but not sure how quickly they'll have the operation up and running.
1019353,Tjames09,2017-12-12 06:51:00,664,Call Tim hales. Never know when they have they’re huts  out.  I’m sure if it’s safe they’ll be out as soon as they can
1019356,Old Ironmaker,2017-12-12 07:46:00,8243,"Not sure where you are but if there is ice Binbrook Conservation Area is an easy, kid friendly ice fishing spot. They rent clams. Only 10 minutes to McDonalds."
1019358,Shloim,2017-12-12 11:45:00,515,"Thanks for tje tips and invite Johnny. I'm trying to make a small tradition where I take my kids on their PA days. Last year was our first and was great, except the ice was lousy and wet. But im not one to often pass on opportunities so let me know when you are going sir! Thanks again!"
1019360,Acountdeleted,2017-12-12 12:55:00,2562,Thats a good point.  I'd honestly wait until Cooks freezes over. I've never had anyone have a bad time when the school of perch come rushing in.
1019365,AKRISONER,2017-12-12 14:19:00,5558,go to island lake...non stop pike and perch action and it freezes early.
1019366,Acountdeleted,2017-12-12 14:23:00,2562,Where do you get the perch on Island? (Won't ask about pike. Thats just rude) all I've ever gotten there is a frozen rear end. (PM if you don't feel comfortable posting here?)
1019367,AKRISONER,2017-12-12 14:31:00,5558,ill send ya  a PM
1019368,Shloim,2017-12-12 14:43:00,515,Me too please
1019369,AKRISONER,2017-12-12 14:44:00,5558,lol
