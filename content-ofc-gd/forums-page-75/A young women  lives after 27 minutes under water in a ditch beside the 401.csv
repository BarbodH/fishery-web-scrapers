It was last winter and the article is from The London Free Press. The heroics off our brave first responders, in this case a few special OPP officers and a citizen outside London. It is a must read all. It explains what a person goes through when submerged in icy waters and that miracles happen. I don't see the authors name but will find it, he or she deserves accolades for their writing. http://special.lfpress.com/27-minutes/chapter-01"

I got emotional just following the story, I can't even imagine how emotional it must have been for all those involved. They all deserve medals. Tks for the link OI. Btw the author is the Jane Sims lady in the videos. Shows it on the first page. Kudos to her.  Cheers"
