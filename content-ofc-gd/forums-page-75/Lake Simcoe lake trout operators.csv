Hoping this year will be different.  However, I belive there are a few operators on kempenfelt bay that did get out for lakers last year.  Can anyone recommend one I should book with?  I would like to try it out at least once or twice this winter.  Also with laker fishing, I am guessing its not catching one after the other like perch fishing.  I have never ice fished for them.  On average, how many can I expect to hook into in a single 8-4 outing considering I get out with the good operator and use the right bait.  Just checking so that I don't bring my impatient friend on this trip lol in case it is normally slower type of fishing.  Thanks  "

1019523,huzzsaba,2017-12-13 23:31:00,884,"Thanks Bill and Brian. I will probably book with Donny and if that doesn't go well, try Ryan."
1019525,misfish,2017-12-13 23:41:00,29133,"Check the many laker chasing videos on you tube. That will get you started. It,s the game of all games to play. Bring lots of quarters. LOL"
1019527,huzzsaba,2017-12-13 23:58:00,884,"Believe me, I have been watching those videos!  How is laker fishing during the night hours?  I noticed they have a 24 hour rate as well for $100.  Not a bad price I think,"
1019529,turtle,2017-12-14 00:28:00,274,"I've fished on the east side with both Hales and on K-Bay with an operator since passed away.  Agree with either dead or exciting.  Could do better if mobile rather than the operator's hut.  Definitely trout chase both up & down, I had them come up and grab spreaders on the way down."
1019530,misfish,2017-12-14 00:34:00,29133,Would you be talking about Clarence? Grumpy. Cannings fish huts?
1019539,turtle,2017-12-14 10:37:00,274,Fontaine.
1019558,AKRISONER,2017-12-14 18:04:00,5558,"I wouldnt take someone expecting non stop action lake trout fishing, thats just my two cents. If he doesnt understand that catching 1 laker is better than catching 10 perch then you should stick with perch lol"
1019559,BillM,2017-12-14 18:10:00,17367, Pretty much.
1019729,huzzsaba,2017-12-16 15:23:00,884,"Thanks for all the replies. Hopefully last question, does the weather, daylight, barometric pressure affect being that they are so deep. I have booked with Tim Hales for february.  fingers crossed it is safe to get out there."
1019730,Garnet,2017-12-16 15:42:00,2056,Let all that crap go. Listen to the fish and keep adjusting until the fish listen.
1019732,huzzsaba,2017-12-16 15:57:00,884,Yes Sir..  Thanks
1019733,BillM,2017-12-16 16:07:00,17367,Some times they just don't listen     I yell down the hole all the time!
1019736,misfish,2017-12-16 16:19:00,29133,Bear Point booth was a busy place this morning. Taking bookings. That and at the finder. Stupid fish. I know your down there.
