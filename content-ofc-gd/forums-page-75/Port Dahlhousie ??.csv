1018160,BillM,2017-11-22 21:40:00,17367,"I didn't mean they weren't nice guys, but if you're the guy interrupting everyone's drift, you'll get told real quick.   You gotta work together in a place like that or else it's a crap show."
1018181,DJGeneral,2017-11-23 13:08:00,163,Point taken!
1018796,PUMP KNOWS,2017-12-04 14:58:00,937,Anyone know if theirs a website to show an update on the water flow?  I went down recently and they had shut off the dam.
1018815,spyder3g,2017-12-04 20:02:00,50,"Yes, they did. I was there as well. Maybe 12M creek data helps. https://wateroffice.ec.gc.ca/report/real_time_e.html?mode=Graph&type=&stn=02HA031&startDate=2017-09-04&endDate=2017-12-04&prm1=46&y1Max=&y1Min=&prm2=47&y2Max=&y2Min="

1019403,lureme,2017-12-12 20:58:00,21,"Hello everyone, this is my first post as you all guest, so no laughing or poking please. I love fishing and sharing stories as well as information. I have acquired a lot of information and experience in all aspects of just about every type of fresh water fishing there is . But as we all know one can never have enough and know it all . So that being said I hope you forgive me if I pick your brains  from time to time as I want you all to do the same to me . So to start with most of my trout fishing has been in the north , Owen sound South Hampton areas and would like to know of some closer areas in the golden horseshoe area and times to do so. Also I have never gone brook trout fishing and would like some spots to try."
1019406,Old Ironmaker,2017-12-12 21:11:00,8243,Welcome lureme. Nice introduction. I suggest you post what you wrote under your own thread heading. This will be buried and not everyone will see it. You are in the middle of the best fishing in southern Ontario. Lake Ontario and its tributaries including Trout from The Niagara River to well east of T.O.  and 45 minutes from Lake Erie and some World class Walleye and Smallmouth Bass. Here is one of the small  Pics from this summer!! 
1019419,lureme,2017-12-12 22:27:00,21,"Thanx for your kind advice , will do as I learn to navigate this forum sight better. And nice walleye, makes me drool . Just to return a favor here is one my son is holding up that I caught at fall time in the grand river. "
1019477,DJGeneral,2017-12-13 14:35:00,163,IronMaker take me walleye fishing with youuuuuuuuuuuuuu
1019497,AKRISONER,2017-12-13 19:16:00,5558,iron has finally figured out how to post pictures it seems....its almost strange to put a face to the voice/words
1019506,Old Ironmaker,2017-12-13 20:48:00,8243,"I'm going to post pics of me 15 years ago, muscles and all that are gone now. I should have first. And anyone here is more than welcome to join me here on Erie for a Walleye hunt next year. A recent CV or resume may be required. Also a list of recent medications you are taking for psychological issues. 110% true story I swear on the lives of my parents. I once went out with a guy from a different site I met online, in his boat, 1st mistake. Not 5 minutes into the trip he took out his Bible and started reading me passages trying to convince me to join his team. Absolutely nothing wrong with having Religion but there is a time and place for everything. I was stuck out there because his boat. Then I came up with the idea to tell him I had diarrhea and if I could use his bait bucket and towel for toilet paper. I also took out one of our longtime members here and he fell out of the boat, I'll take responsibility for that one regardless of who fell out of the boat and why, in 52F water to boot. That was about 6 years back, still not long enough ago for him to think it's funny."
1019507,Old Ironmaker,2017-12-13 20:52:00,8243,"Here is a pic of the last venture out this year. Most of the Wally's this year were smaller fish, which is just fine, 2 to 4lbs. They are rare here and the tastiest by far. The big fish are not that old and taste fantastic too. A fish as big as our biggies up north are old fish and I would never keep one for the table anyway. That's a big size Coke bottle. "
1019538,lureme,2017-12-14 07:20:00,21,"I agree with you Ironmaker, there is a time and place for everything, when I go fishing  I leave all my cares and stress behind. Some people say I'm obsessed and crazy about fishing, that is their mistake as I proceed to tell them what fishing is all about for me any way.. "" The excitement, anticipating, the scenery, fresh air, friendships, stories, adventures, learning, and sometimes the fight."" Even if I fail to catch a fish or just catch and release I still find something from that adventure to take home in my memories. I really do not know of another sport that has so much going for it where you can go or take someone and enjoy the day in such a way."
1019540,DJGeneral,2017-12-14 11:19:00,163,Ill get that Resume and CV ready Ironmaker btw do we need references ?
1017760,DJGeneral,2017-11-16 20:48:00,163,Hey Guys going to be in St Catherines Visiting my sister in law I was thinking to check out the port in the morning What are the best access points this time year if I'm targeting brown trout or rainbow trout any help would be appreciated i have my mind settled for the dam right in town Also the 12 mile creek runs through her backyard i was thinking about going there as well but any other suggestions would be grateful !  Thanks Guys
1017770,bigugli,2017-11-16 22:10:00,6138,"You have 2 choices of drift for trout. East side  up stream from the Game & Fish Clubhouse, or behind the Legion.  The 12 Mile creek is very muddy right now. You could try martindal pond for bass or pike."
1017814,DJGeneral,2017-11-17 12:43:00,163,"Thanks for your help, looked at some videos on youtube and think ill try that spot near the dam even seen a comment that browns were being caught there yesterday and if that fails ill stroll down to martindale pond like you said Thanks!"
1017816,Old Ironmaker,2017-11-17 13:02:00,8243,"I always drive by there to get to my brothers place. I hope it isn't like it was last week when I went by, it was shoulder to shoulder. Fish early and go slay em' DJ."
1017818,DJGeneral,2017-11-17 13:08:00,163,Thats the plan brother! The weather has other ideas but im dressing for it!
1017822,DJGeneral,2017-11-17 14:08:00,163,Another question guys Whats Parking Like down there?
1017832,manitoubass2,2017-11-17 16:08:00,11391,I wish I knew the area so I could offer some input bud Sound like a good chance to fish a new area which is always exciting! Tightlines!
1017840,Old Ironmaker,2017-11-17 19:19:00,8243,"If you get there early there is parking, but things may have changed since I last stopped there. I'll see if I can get a hold of my brother and ask."
1017841,Old Ironmaker,2017-11-17 19:22:00,8243,
1017994,DJGeneral,2017-11-20 12:54:00,163,Thanks for everyones help I had a good day on saturday landing 3 browns in 3 hours its was really packed counted 40 guys shoulder to shoulder but the bite was fire and yes ironmaker a lot of cars from the USA were there i got there by 5am and the was already 15 cars in the parking lot but 7am there was 40 + people fishing Glad i got there early by 8am it was a zoo so i took off! 
1017998,grimsbylander,2017-11-20 13:59:00,3016,"3 browns by 8am is awesome. Good job but... the rules are, no pics no fish! lol"
1017999,AKRISONER,2017-11-20 14:17:00,5558,impressive! I saw this thread last week but was out on a course and didnt get to reply. Seems you didnt need any help from me anyways!
1018007,DJGeneral,2017-11-20 15:22:00,163,I knew someone was going to say that lol but i strategically left my phone in the car so the girlfriend doesnt bother me! Just kidding forgot the phone in the car was to scared to leave my spot and run back to the car because it was so packed!! I promise pictures when i go back this weekend!  The fishing was so hot anyone could have hooked up i probably seen over 15 fish landed it was insane i couldnt believe it
1018029,huzzsaba,2017-11-20 20:53:00,884,"Were you bottom bouncing? Last time I went there a few weeks ago, the dam was wide open due to some construction and the current was too strong. Even the regulars were complaining about the current."
1018045,misfish,2017-11-20 23:40:00,29133,"Im sure you can remember the days standing on the wall at the dam . That was the spot to be there at 3am. Even then, you were the 5th guy in the row. I know it,s off limits now. When they did close it off ( property owner ) we brought the tinny in there. LOL Those were the days."
1018069,DJGeneral,2017-11-21 12:45:00,163,"Yah Huzzsaba i was bottom bouncing with roe bags,"
1018074,grimsbylander,2017-11-21 14:03:00,3016,"LOL Yup! You have to be careful with a boat in there now. With the new technology in reels and longer rods, guys can almost cast halfway across the river and there's guys on both sides! I'll head down there in December/January...less fish but way less guys. A good snow storm or cold snap seems to thin the herd."
1018076,AKRISONER,2017-11-21 14:10:00,5558, last time i was out it was during a torrential downpour on christmas eve...needless to say we were catching and so were the other 3 guys on the pier.
1018077,grimsbylander,2017-11-21 14:13:00,3016,FIFA LOL joking Good on you for persevering through that!
1018080,DJGeneral,2017-11-21 15:33:00,163,Hopefully i see you down there ! There was a boat on saturday about 30 feet away from the dam as well wish i can upload the video i took when i was leaving of the herd that was there! My buddy was curious as to why no one centrepin fishes here? i couldn't give him a reason anyone care to enlighten us?
1018101,BillM,2017-11-22 00:36:00,17367,Because everyone is bottom bouncing
1018130,DJGeneral,2017-11-22 12:40:00,163,duhhhh lol should have thought of that haha
1018143,misfish,2017-11-22 16:22:00,29133,Cant remember the last time I did that. Im a visual guy. LOL
1018147,BillM,2017-11-22 16:45:00,17367,They'd throw you off the pier in Port D if you're started float fishing in the middle of all the bottom bouncing guys lol.   That's one place where everyone needs to be in sync
1018149,misfish,2017-11-22 16:50:00,29133,"Ya, I have heard that."
