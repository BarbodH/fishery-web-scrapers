1019147,Tom S,2017-12-09 20:24:00,362,For all those who may be fly-curious. It's good when we can laugh at ourselves.  
1019256,HTHM,2017-12-11 03:23:00,4082,"I watched on a Sunday, so it is now a Sunday funny."
1019259,Old Ironmaker,2017-12-11 04:02:00,8243,"Sorry Tom but that wasn't funny on Sunday either. Listening to his fake accent is like the sound of  nails across a chalk board. I lasted to 5:06, does it get funnier? Maybe you have to know fly fishing to get it. Plus it's fake news. He doesn't have a Tilly on so no way he knows how to fly fish. OK to be fair to the guy I watched the rest. The funniest person was the guy in the yellow hat that didn't say a word, he stole the show. The Dunnville Community Theatre is putting a  Norm Foster comedy on this spring, I don't think Hank will get a part. Sorry neighbour."
1019271,Tom S,2017-12-11 12:19:00,362,Huh. I thought it was a pretty good satire of both stereotypes - the elitist fly guide with an Orvis-endorsed pickle up his arse and the meat hunting spin fisherman using marshmallow for trout. But I guess if you need to explain something it's probably not that funny in the end.
