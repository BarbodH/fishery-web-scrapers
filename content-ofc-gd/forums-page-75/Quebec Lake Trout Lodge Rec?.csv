1019458,Joeytier,2017-12-13 03:07:00,3990,Any excuse to stay home eh...I guess the thousands and thousands of Americans that flock here year-round are out to lunch.  
1019459,Old Ironmaker,2017-12-13 03:19:00,8243,"Please don't take it personally Joey but I can see how you would. You don't represent the entire Province. I haven't had  good experiences there. We went to Reserve Beauchene and were not treated very well at all.  I went with a few Yanks and they were overtly disrespected and it embarrassed me as a Canadian. They didn't know I spoke some French and some things they were saying wasn't good, and we are paying them? When we had a camp on the Ottawa we often went over the bridge at Pembroke to Ft. Coulange and some of those folks were wonderful, some complete ass jacks. When in Verdun we had to fight our way out of town more than a few times after a game, why? We were from Ontario."
995837,douG,2017-03-01 03:18:00,2693,"I haven't been around much for a while, but I am still kicking.  Good to see so many ol timers are still active on the board. Yes, I know - rest easy, joey. You will be deeply missed.  I am planning one more fly in with my Dad and his buddies, and want to look at Quebec this time.  Something kinda cushy is the request as the old folks are in their late 80s now,with good fish and facilities a must, American plan, with a float base within say 8 hrs of Ottawa. Lakers or specs.  Thanks in advance. Cheers!"
995839,chris.brock,2017-03-01 03:43:00,4053," I gave up on researching outfitters in Quebec. Even the provincial tourism websites suck. I'm sure there's some really cool places to go in QUE but with the language barrier and the outfitter's poor web presence, I just said fucht this.  Good luck though"
995846,misfish,2017-03-01 11:33:00,29133,"Hey, it,s that samidch guy. LOL"
995939,douG,2017-03-02 00:24:00,2693,"Thanks for the reply, Chris.  I hear what you are saying about the frustrating web presence.  I am hoping that this will mean less traffic and better fishing, as long as I can find what I am looking for.  I will keep you posted and throw up a trip report on my return.  Yep, Brian!  I took a page out of Meely's book about the gweeches, and I still take em fishing with me when I go.  Hope all is well with you."
996024,Joeytier,2017-03-02 18:34:00,3990,"You have many many choices and the fishing is pretty much excellent anywhere.  Are you bringing your own boats?  How big of a lake would you tolerate?  Not sure how cushy is too cushy for your group, but Reserve Beauchene is pretty much the epitome of excellent trout fishing, and 5+ star accomodations.  The main lake is great for lakers, and they have tons of backlakes loaded with specks, splake, and lakers (some stocked, and some natural).  Cabonga reservoir is an amazing lake trout fishery, and apparently a pretty beautiful and gigantic piece of water, don't know any particular outfitters but I'm sure there are some very nice facilities on the lake.  There are many ZEC's in the province which operate nice outfitters in areas with lots of small brook and lake trout waterbodies.  Go on the main ZEC website, click english and spend a night investigating your options if you're more into the small lake thing."

I speak english just fine."
996143,douG,2017-03-04 06:11:00,2693,"Thanks, Joeytier.  That's some good info.  No, we won't be dragging boats on this trip, so the size of the lake would be limited by the boats provided by the lodge or outfitter.  Large open water is a challenge for most lodge-provided boats.  I am looking into Beauchene and Cabonga now, and grateful for your help."
996144,gaspumper,2017-03-04 12:24:00,393,"Take a look at ""labrador air safaris"" we went to lake Berti a few years ago nothing but speckle trout,biggest we got was 7 lb."
996150,gaspumper,2017-03-04 13:14:00,393,Just read this on another site =  
996171,douG,2017-03-04 16:18:00,2693,"Gaspumper, did you fly in to Berte from Baie Comeau?"
996200,gaspumper,2017-03-04 21:28:00,393,"Gaspumper, did you fly in to Berte from Baie Comeau? Yes we did,we fished the Berte North camp."
997678,douG,2017-03-22 22:49:00,2693,"OK!  It's done!  Four of us are booked into Lac Roz for the second week in June.  Lac Roz is about 100 km north of the Transtaiga road that runs E/W across the James Bay region, serving Hydro Quebec and the La Grande river system of generating stations.  We will fly from Montreal to LG-4 airport in a PC-12 Pilatus, about 1000 km, and then take a float plane from there, about 150 km, to the lake.  The camp has hot and cold running water, shower, propane stove and fridge.  Food is provided for us, along with 21 ft Vercheres river boats and new 20 hp four strokes.  The targets are lake and speckled trout, and there are pike as well.  Just 80 more sleeps!  I think BigCreekDad has been up that way with MIrage Outfitters almost 10 years ago, and maybe Fishnsled? Has anyone else fished Roz?  Thanks again, joeytier, for your great advice.  Perseverance paid off!"
997682,misfish,2017-03-22 23:16:00,29133,So your roughing it I see. LOL  Enjoy your trip douG.
997687,douG,2017-03-23 00:06:00,2693,"Thanks, Brian. It could be the last trip I make with Pa who will be 85 this summer.  His days of sleeping four to a tent on LaVieille, Hogan or LaMuir in  Algonquin are behind him. Even if the weather turns crap we will all be comfortable. There will be a report of course."

Great choice, you won't regret it. You'll catch more fish than you ever have in your life."
997729,Big Cliff,2017-03-23 13:09:00,6899,"Check on the availability of potable water, one would assume that with hot and cold running water the water would be potable, not always the case! I just picked up some Aquatabs for our trip in June.  I'll be interested in seeing your report when you get back, enjoy!"
997780,douG,2017-03-23 17:28:00,2693,"Thanks, BillM.  You know there will be a report.  Solopaddler has offered to set me up with some flyfishing gear and casting tutorial on the Grand as well before we leave. Now THERE's an offer I can't refuse! We agree it would simply be a crime to fish river-run brookies without a fly rod.  Mike is a standup guy, I don't care what anyone says LOL.  Appreciate the comment, Sterling.  Pa worked up there in the late 70s and early 80s, commissioning the hydro stations, so this will be a chance to return to his old stomping grounds and do some serious fishing.  It will be a first for the rest of us to visit the subarctic.  Thanks, BigCliff, for the drinking water tip.  I bought a katadyn filter system a few years ago for my algonquin and fly in trips, and it has served me well.  It will definitely make the trip.  Cheers!"
997834,floater,2017-03-24 09:39:00,220,We drove by the Trans Taiga Road two years ago and fished a few lakes along the James Bay Highway. Lots of pike and pickeral. You will have a great time up there. You might even see the Caribou Heard roaming around!
997866,BillM,2017-03-24 14:39:00,17367,"Doug, make sure you bring a bunch of top water mouse patterns, don't let Mike talk you into fishing nothing but streamers!   :)       I've also got a bunch if you need them, just let me know."
997873,Carp,2017-03-24 15:46:00,1488,Nice to see you're still around douG. I can't offer advice on the trip you haven't already received.  Have a great trip and don't forget.......pictures......we want pictures !!!
1019400,Nemo,2017-12-12 20:15:00,727,Hi just got an email this morning and wanted to track down douG. Glad to see so many names I still remember. douG where is the report . My son did a 6 week canoe trip up there and wants me to go up fishing. Let me know how it went.
1019420,Old Ironmaker,2017-12-12 22:39:00,8243,I was wondering why this old thread came up. I'm glad I noticed the date before I replied. Maybe Art can help you tracking down doug Nemo. I know he can't give out any email addresses but maybe he can contact douG to contact you. I won't fish in Quebec ever again. Like being beamed down to a different planet.
1019425,akaShag,2017-12-12 23:35:00,2073,"tagged for interest. Missed it the first time around, and I am always looking for a new spot!!!  (This year it was Haida Gwaii....) Doug"
