1019544,FLEX ROD,2017-12-14 12:16:00,394,"Hi Folks, have not been on the site in ages, like the new look. It has been crazy year for me, broke ground on the new house construction first week in July, and having to deal with mother nature all summer and all fall with the rain has really been a challenge, any way, anybody on the site or anybody on know some one who does septic systems? I have some quotes but the numbers a crazy hence the reason for the plea of help, I really would still like to get the septic this year so that I can then get rid of the porta potty and continue with my internal finishing. We are building up around Flesherton area, any info would be greatly appriciated as this is really holding me back right now.  Thanks in advance, FLEX - John"
1019554,grimsbylander,2017-12-14 16:08:00,3016,I'll make a call for you. I grew up in Flesherton and my buddy owns the large septic tank/portable potties business there. Just talked to him yesterday in fact. He'll know who to go to in the area.
1019569,AKRISONER,2017-12-14 20:41:00,5558,the pricing friggin shocked me as well when we had to redo ours last year...i honestly couldnt believe it. Good luck man!

1019594,Rizzo,2017-12-15 01:11:00,4754,I don't know anyone up that way...but I think you'd be looking at around 25k for a residential septic. We got quotes a couple years back when we were debating replacing ours (haven't yet) and I think 25 k was about the norm. Are your quotes in this price range?
1019603,Mister G,2017-12-15 11:20:00,1429,"Whatever guy you pick, NEGOTIATE with him. There is a LOT of room in those quoted prices when it come to stuff like this. Their quoted price is not in stone........if they say the best price they could do it for is $5000, tell him you are budgeted for only $4400 ( for a example). Good Luck and hang onto that wallet because they want it ALL.."
