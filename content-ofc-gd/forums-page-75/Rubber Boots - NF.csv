1019032,Weeds,2017-12-08 00:30:00,782,"I've got to be the only guy who ever got a bad pair of the Baffin Titans. Mine leaked (both I think) within a very short time of getting them. They were definitely warm though prior to the leaks. If I ever needed another pair I'd still consider them, I'd just be sure to keep my receipt for the first time in my life. It's also worth noting that these are big, cumbersome boots, not light by any stretch of the imagination."
1019037,chris.brock,2017-12-08 01:13:00,4053,"No you're not. I had a Titan leak really early and no I didn't step on a nail or cook them beside the campfire. I get a pair of boots/ year from work so I've stockpiled quite a few boots. I still think Titans are good (my other pairs). I live in them in the winter, I don't seem to mind that they are heavy (mine are steel toe) and they are warmer than the Kamiks and stuff when it's really cold."
1019041,Old Ironmaker,2017-12-08 01:55:00,8243,"I picked up of Kamics last year, they come above the calf and draw strings keep them water proof. No model name just Kamic Canada. Good aggressive treads, and removable liners. They are toasty and dry and a good value. I think they were less than 100 bucks, actually I'm positive because I wouldn't never pay more than that. Al's shoes in Simcoe On. Not very fashionable with my Citiot Armani suits."
1019059,ratherboutdoors,2017-12-08 15:23:00,132,I have a pair of Muck's that have been great and I hear Nokians are great as well but they are hard to find.
1019065,jimmer,2017-12-08 16:59:00,2730,"I think much depends on whether you have a problem with cold feet or not. I went to the Titans and don't have that problem anymore, all other brands in the price range never did it for me."
1019074,bare foot wader,2017-12-08 17:55:00,1354,"Been a while since I've logged on here, sure looks different!!! If you're looking for a multi purpose boot, best rubber boot I've ever worn is the dunlops....with a light weight wool sock I'm comfortable in them down to about -10ish, wear them with bama socks or heavy wool sock when it gets colder out...I like them much more than the baffins, easier for walking around and lighter if you're looking for a boot to sit all day ice fishing/treestand and stay warm, minimal activity, I'd go for a bulkier boot with a liner https://www.marks.com/en/product/34478.html?cid=DRMKT&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIy8n-uv361wIVCspkCh3vSQqbEAYYAiABEgKcDfD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds&dclid=COyS1rz9-tcCFRDewAodtToB8w#34478=CHABLK&34478=8&34478[width]=REG&fo_c=1301&fo_k=f7794104a34ed6210570efcbefb4bb41&fo_s=gplaca&cid=KWGoogle_[*Campaign*]_[*Adgroup*]  "
1019099,grimsbylander,2017-12-08 22:21:00,3016,"Thanks for all the great feedback guys! So I went to TSC today and tried on a pair of Titans. I normally wear a size 10 and when I tried them on, they were tight. Not short on length, just squeeze my foot tight. The liners are super thick and maybe they'll flatten down a bit?? Plus I just had on a pair of white sport socks....the worse cold weather sock there is. For the Titan guys, did you have to buy a larger pair to compensate for the thick liners? Do they loosen up after a few miles? Thanks!"
1019100,misfish,2017-12-08 22:27:00,29133,"They are like that Dave when new. Every ones foot is different. I like the way ( when new ) they were very supportive. They do get more comfy once your foot has molded the foam. I wear mine only in the fall for river fishing if I dont want to wear waders, and for ice fishing, thats it.  They are not for everyday mucking. I have my kodiacs for that. As for socks, I only wear those redheads that are guarantied for life. Those are sweet comfy warm too."

1018917,grimsbylander,2017-12-06 21:40:00,3016,"Just looking for advice from those in the know. I'm wanting to buy a new pair of insulated rubber boots for all round use...fishing(ice and river), hunting, working outside, whatever. Any particular brand suggestions? LaCrosse? Redhead? Thanks"
1018922,misfish,2017-12-06 22:29:00,29133,"Going on my 7th year with these. Yes a bit heavy if your a walker ( I dont mind though ), but warm as hell. Many ice anglers use these.  http://www.baffin.com/product-p/23550000.htm"
1018923,DRIFTER_016,2017-12-06 22:35:00,10439,I've always just used these for the most part. http://www.canadiantire.ca/en/pdp/kamik-hunter-mens-and-boys-insulated-rubber-boot-green-0873282p.html#srp I wear them here in Yellowknife in the winter when working outside the house here in town and use them in the spring and fall when fishing/launching the boat etc. Inexpensive and they last quite a long time. When ice fishing/snowmobiling etc I wear my white US military bunny boots.
1018925,mike rousseau,2017-12-06 22:39:00,4661,I’m pretty sure I have the same ones  love em  super warm and comfy like slippers  not very supportive for walking though  if I gotta hike I use gore Tex Rocky boots
1018932,Terry,2017-12-06 23:15:00,14456,yup i have the same ones and they do work well
1018943,porkpie,2017-12-07 01:03:00,2521,"I buy the deluxe kamiks that go on sale at Canadian tire for $40-45.  They last 3-4 seasons and work well for everything, including ice fishing.  Can't beat it!"
1018948,SirCranksalot,2017-12-07 02:50:00,3291,Titans all the way!!! 
1018951,Old Ironmaker,2017-12-07 03:16:00,8243,"I have CDN and US Military Bunny Boots, going on 15 years with these things. The Canadian and US military are issued  these white things in the Arctic. Not great for long walks but just fantastic to keep warm and dry and that's what you want. If you see them come up on Kijiji or EBay buy them. I paid 50 bucks for mine at the Army Surplus in Hamilton. When you watch all these reality TV shows in Alaska and the Yukon you will see most everyone wears them."
1018954,DRIFTER_016,2017-12-07 04:09:00,10439,These are my ice fishin' booties. Got a set of the black Mickeys too. 
1018955,Old Ironmaker,2017-12-07 04:20:00,8243,"Them there are the ones big fella. I'm surprised I don't see more in Ontario. I've seen a few Yanks with them on the Bay of Quinte. They may be hard to find down here. Like I said some find they aren't great for long hikes. I have never had a problem with comfort myself. See guys, The Yukon! I may just have to find a source and flog them here, at OFC member prices of course. I said I paid 50 bucks, a typo, it was 100 bananas!!"
1018956,grimsbylander,2017-12-07 04:42:00,3016,"What happens if you get half way across the lake and get a flat?? lol Yeah those are great boots. I knew a place in the US that sold the black Mickey boots 30 years ago and being a young feller, I couldn't afford them. I should keep my eyes open now for a pair. In the mean time, I'll decide between the Titans and the less expense Kamiks. EDIT: I just checked out the bunny boots on ebay...they're cheap compared to years ago! $50 - $100 bucks canadian...wow. I remember them selling for a couple hundred bucks 30 years ago! "
1018982,jimmer,2017-12-07 15:37:00,2730,"Titans all the way also.  The Kamiks just don't cut it for me in the frigid temps. Just make sure you get a snug fit, which is better for walking."
1018984,Rod Caster,2017-12-07 15:41:00,5784,"The baffins are awesome. Awkward, but warm as hell. I bought Muck boots... they are super comfortable for walking, but my feet get cold. Not impressed with the warmth factor"
1018985,jimmer,2017-12-07 15:48:00,2730,TSC usually has the Titans on sale at some point throughout the year. http://www.tscstores.com/Rubber-Boots-C1450.aspx
1018988,SirCranksalot,2017-12-07 16:06:00,3291,"I don't know about the 'deluxe kamiks' but the normal ones are really crappy. Not waterproof about the rubber shoe part. Also, wears out quickly in the nylon material part above the rubber.   My bros swear by Prairies. Can't buy them in my area, though. They are apparently a lot lighter than Titans.  Might be 'worth the drive to Acton"" .  http://weaverdevore.ca/products-page/winter-footwear/mens-winter-footwear/acton-prairie-insulated-rubber-boot/ "
1018989,porkpie,2017-12-07 16:14:00,2521,"I've been wearing kamiks in different variations for hunting and fishing 3 seasons of the year for the last 15 years or so.  Every 3 or 4 years they fall right off my feet, but until that happens they are pretty warm and waterproof.  Sorry you have had poor luck, but I wear mine all the time and they do the job just fine.  I steelhead quite a bit, and for a lot of rivers in southern Ontario especially the smaller ones, you don't need waders and I detest wearing waders to start with so I wear the kamiks an aweful lot.  I've had very good service from them."
1018991,SirCranksalot,2017-12-07 16:42:00,3291,I think we must be talking about 2 different kinds of boots here. Mine were definitely not waterproof above that rubber shoe part.
1018995,AKRISONER,2017-12-07 17:32:00,5558,can we all agree to try find some Titans on sale lol my sorrels used to be awesome before we got these global warming winters where 60% of the time the lake is a foot of water and slush. im in the market for something to keep my feet dry this year.
