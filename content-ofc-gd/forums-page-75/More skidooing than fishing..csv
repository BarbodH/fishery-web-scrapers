Finally got a few hours off work and decided to head out from my place. The lake I went to was sketchy, 9"" of crappy ice at the landing, and then only 5"" of solid black ice in the main basin, took a long time to finally drill a hole after breaking trail and checking ice as I went............  https://youtu.be/L_HYYxMMm5U"
