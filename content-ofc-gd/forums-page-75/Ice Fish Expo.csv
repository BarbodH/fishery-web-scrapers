1019791,SirCranksalot,2017-12-17 02:31:00,3291,"I found this guy interesting as a shelter from the wind and possibly the rain. Pop-ups are a bit of a PITA, flip overs a bit heavy to pull if you are walking. \ "
1019792,irishfield,2017-12-17 02:41:00,26272,"Yah, they've been advertising in the local buy and sell here for a month or more. Still don't understand why no material flap to kick some snow up onto.. so the wind doesn't freeze your feet or blow snow into your hole."
1019797,Old Ironmaker,2017-12-17 03:27:00,8243,"More outhouse than ice fishing shelter, Yea what about the feet? Silly really and people buy them."
1019804,Fisherman,2017-12-17 13:23:00,7201,"If you're not sitting in it on a windy day you better have it anchored down, otherwise you'll be doing a marathon run trying to catch it."
1019807,BillM,2017-12-17 15:21:00,17367,"Yup, kinda useless if your hole is being blown over with snow."
1019819,wkrp,2017-12-17 17:04:00,656,I thought the Snowdog wasÂ  pretty cool
1019830,misfish,2017-12-17 18:11:00,29133,"It was a packed house yesterday. Not so much today. The snow dog was interesting to look over. Price tag was not so friendly, but realize, it,s a 12 month machine.   Granddaughter had a great time. "
1019832,Terry,2017-12-17 18:23:00,14456,"so, how much for the snow dog "
1019833,misfish,2017-12-17 18:25:00,29133,$4300 +. It came with the pull sled and seat this weekend for that price.
1019834,Terry,2017-12-17 18:26:00,14456,ok way too much
