1019618,Tjames09,2017-12-15 15:24:00,664,Good stuff. Cant imagine how cold that would feel.
1019620,Acountdeleted,2017-12-15 15:36:00,2562,Takes a brave man to willingly put yourself through the ice. Kudos.  Back in college we did ice safety training and I can honestly say it was near impossible to get out without ice picks. Should be mandatory for anyone ice fishing. Even for anyone with a float suit (or in our case we had dry suits) its still a fight to get out of the water regardless.  Stay safe out there everyone.
1019625,SirCranksalot,2017-12-15 16:14:00,3291,Wow. That took guts! I must admit that my picks are not always around my neck. They won't do me much good elsewhere! 
1019633,NAW,2017-12-15 17:18:00,4022,"Thanks for posting that video Steve!  Could you see any open water from shore??  I'm going for Crappies tomorrow assuming there some decent ice on my lake.  But I am almost certain that if couch is mostly skimmed over, then my lake will have a good 3-4""...."
1019634,Old Ironmaker,2017-12-15 17:36:00,8243,"Or a stupid man. Not you Steve me. 35 years ago I decided it would be fun doing the Polar Bear Swim on New Years day in Lake Ontario. It was neither fun nor smart. If I went through today I wouldn't have to worry about drowning, I would be dead from the heart attack well before I drowned. Please guys I know you die hard ice fisherguys are chomping at the bit to get out on the ice. Be careful, this is the time of the year you hear about lives being lost on the lakes, especially on machines."
1019637,Tjames09,2017-12-15 17:52:00,664,"Not sure how far north you are, I measure only 2"" where I am....and most of its white ice."
1019641,BillM,2017-12-15 18:01:00,17367,Great vid Steve!
1019656,farsider,2017-12-15 20:36:00,456,"Everyone who boats in the fall/ spring or ice fishes should watch the 1hr Cold Water Boot Camp video.  Or at least the 10 min version. Research from U. of Manitoba's Dr. Giesbrecht. Very informative, not overly sensational but, could help save someones life. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GeP0DHImJdc  http://www.coldwaterbootcamp.com/pages/home.html  Cheers, Mark"
