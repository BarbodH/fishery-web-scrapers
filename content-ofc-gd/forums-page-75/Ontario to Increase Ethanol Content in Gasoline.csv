1018957,Old Ironmaker,2017-12-07 04:50:00,8243,"I hear you Geoff, we have to do our part. What irks me is with this Global economy we have to compete with it just isn't a level playing ground. I have visited Steel Mills all over the world. What costs us in the millions to put in place and run environmental controls to reduce air and water emissions as well as maintain the health and safety of the workers and the local community there are countries like China, India and Iran that doesn't have them nor are legislated to have them. I once asked a Chinese representative attending an AISI (American Institute of Steel and Iron) meeting in Hamilton how many Blast Furnaces are running in China? He said he didn't know because some backwater areas have furnaces to produce Pig Iron for their own local community and ship excess to market using technology from the early 1900's. The main producers as well do not have many emission controls in place. They have been talking about a Global excise tax for these producers including Brazil to make it fair, I forgot Brazil,  that's been part of the G- whatever talks for years, it's all lip service. They don't produce Coke in Brazil, metallurgical Coke, the black stuff not white. They burn charcoal. They get the wood from the rain forests. Imagine how many thousands of acres of rainforest is felled to make Iron every year. The last numbers I saw Brazil out produced Steel in Canada by 80 to1. There is a global environmental impact from loosing these forests as well. Many of these countries operating and labour costs are often far less than 50% of ours yet they sell in the same Global market as us. It isn't the high labour and benefit costs of Unionized workers many North American managers blame for market loses it is simply that we can't compete with them at their operating costs. I had better stop now. A quick look showed that China now produces 50% of world Steel production at 808 million tons of finished Steel in 2016. Canada sits in 19 place with 12.6 million tons/2016. Just ahead of Viet Nam and well behind Korea and a few 3rd world countries such as  Iran and Brazil. Why make it if you can't profit from it?"
1018969,Acountdeleted,2017-12-07 12:56:00,2562,Fascinating. Some really good reads and well written articles. Thanks for sharing.  I guess there is no 'Quick Fix' or simple soloution to slow down global warming and reduce the effects of greenhouse gasses. : /
1018974,AKRISONER,2017-12-07 14:20:00,5558,"funny the comment about electric cars...up until the ban on coal consumption in ontario and the implementation of ""clean coal"" in the United States, Electric Cars were dirtier than gasoline. Funny how short sited people can be. I honestly believe that the electric car is the real deal though as long we can keep the cost of electricity down...which in Ontario is a joke...(thanks for stealing a billion dollars...ok too political sorry Art!) It is true that the global economy is unfair because countries like china and india do not maintain the same environmental standards as we do in North America, however at the same time the cost of pollution to those local populations when it comes to cancer and respiratory illness is astronomical. At the end of the day we can sit and point our fingers and say China should do a better job...but at the same time I think we need to take pride in doing things the right way...thats why we are canadian and not Chinese. I have pristine lakes to fish within a half hour of the downtown of Toronto, try that in beijing or New Deli.  I would rather have a sense of pride and be known as the highest standard than stoop to a lower level just because its easier that way. My old man is a metallurgical engineer and he does projects all over the globe, as a rule anything they design is built 100% to Canadian Environmental standards...thats just how canadians do business. When it comes to really dangerous stuff like pressure leaching using acids etc, third world countries cant hire garbage to build these types of plants anyways so they are forced into doing things the right way. Obviously there are also publicly traded companies with invested stake, so they cant be part of an environmental disaster. I am definitely interested in this discussion about the required amount of resources and carbon emissions it takes to create ethanol vs simply refining fuel and using it in a gasoline engine. In fact that is an entirely different discussion and really a feat of pure ingenuity. The efficiency of gasoline and diesel engines is mind blowing. We can talk about cars being a POS...but seriously, what other thing is there out there that you can run for 1,000 hours straight in wildly variable conditions and basically not expect a single blip aside from minor maintenance like a couple of oil changes."
1018990,Old Ironmaker,2017-12-07 16:15:00,8243,"I may know or have met your Father Akri. And yes, we Canadians do it the right way. And encourage other nations to follow our lead. Our environmental emission standards here in Ontario are some of the most stringent in the world and we should all be very proud of it. But try telling that to a laid off worker in manufacturing and the up to 10 workers that support a single job in manufacturing from transportation to sales."
1019081,BITEME,2017-12-08 18:25:00,1968,How dumb is it really to be using a important food source for fuel i have never had a problem burning alcohol based fuels ever so I’m not sure what the issue is aside from your using an important food source
1019097,SirCranksalot,2017-12-08 22:08:00,3291,"I'm not sure this is still true about China. From what I have read and heard they seem to be really cleaning up their coal burning plants, for e.g. "
1019102,Old Ironmaker,2017-12-08 23:13:00,8243,"Of course they are, the plants their Government wants us to see."
1019121,grimsbylander,2017-12-09 13:45:00,3016,"I recently got a Costco membership, though I haven't used it yet, and have a question about their gas station. Do you just have to show your membership card or do you have to have made a store purchase too?"
1019122,porkpie,2017-12-09 13:55:00,2521,"Just drive up, swipe your membership card and then swipe your debit card.  No purchase required.  Whenever I head down to shop I usually gas up.  Their prices are always better than city prices, but not a whole lot better than small town pricing. Worth it if your already there though."
1019123,grimsbylander,2017-12-09 14:16:00,3016,Thanks!
1018875,G.mech,2017-12-06 14:34:00,830,"It looks like we're going to have to deal with even more ethanol in our fuels now that the Ontario government has mandated 10% average ethanol content in gasoline.  The current 5% and the new 10% are the average content across all blends so unless they can put 15% in the regular or something, we're likely going to see some ethanol in the premium blends.  Currently regular has up to 10%  which allows them to keep the premium ethanol free but most cars can't handle any more than 10%  so it's hard to say what the fuel companies are going to do to achieve the new averages.  At any rate, this is not good news for boaters & small engine users.... https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/industry-news/energy-and-resources/ontario-to-double-gasolines-ethanol-content-requirement/article37145115/"
1018876,kenzy31,2017-12-06 15:00:00,261,"This is no good, not for cars, outboards or small engines of any kind! 2 strokes hate that crap they sell now, its only going to get worse and cost the average Joe even more money ?"
1018877,jimmer,2017-12-06 15:01:00,2730,I'm not happy about that. That crap makes a mess of my tank and boat.
1018878,BillM,2017-12-06 15:41:00,17367,Time to by more bottles of Startron for the boat I guess.
1018879,AKRISONER,2017-12-06 15:44:00,5558,Does not effect premium grade...however most marine gas around me is mid grade...looks like ill be hauling more jerry cans around to get the ethanol free gas.
1018882,Acountdeleted,2017-12-06 15:56:00,2562,"They said it'll be the equivalent of taking 130 000 cars off the road every year in terms of CO2 emissions.  Though i feel they need to stop screwing over the consumer to try and be more environmentally friendly, at least they are trying to pretend they are doing something about this."
1018883,fishindevil,2017-12-06 16:11:00,6254,ethanol gas is just plain friggin garbage period..................at least let us have premium that's corn gas free......grrrrrr
1018884,jimmer,2017-12-06 16:18:00,2730,I guess it's one of the easiest things to hit and make it look like they are doing something for the environment.

1018887,LeXXington,2017-12-06 16:39:00,1928,Wonder if they will lower the carbon tax on premium gas? I find most marinas don't even bother with regular gas anymore.  
1018888,John Bacon,2017-12-06 16:39:00,3277,I do recall reading that using ethonal in gas actually leads to a net increase in carbon emissions.  They may be screwing us over for nothing. I did a quick search and found a few links.  I am sure that other studies will show the opposite.  But at least according to some; this isn't even going to help. https://academic.oup.com/bioscience/article/55/7/593/306765 https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/ethanol-not-cut-emissions/ http://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/293291-study-ethanol-increases-carbon-emissions   
1018891,G.mech,2017-12-06 17:02:00,830,How do you know this?  It's kind of up the air as near as I can tell and the oil companies are the ones who will ultimately decide aren't they?
1018892,DRIFTER_016,2017-12-06 17:15:00,10439,Better buy a 45 gallon drum.
1018894,AKRISONER,2017-12-06 17:44:00,5558,"i guess i wasnt clear, the law would only effect regular grade fuel.  If you buy Esso Premium it already has ethanol in it. I know shell v power has no ethanol and i believe Crappy Can's premium is also ethanol free."
1018896,John Bacon,2017-12-06 18:06:00,3277,"Doesn't Canadian Tire get their fuel from Esso?  Or, at least some of it."
1018897,G.mech,2017-12-06 18:22:00,830,"Again, I am not clear on where you're reading this.  The law doesn't stipulate which grades of fuel the ethanol goes in, only that it must average 5% (or now 10%) ethanol for all fuel supplied.  The refiner/distributor determines which brands get juiced.  They could put 10% in all grades or increase the percentage in some and lower it in others.... If you really want to twist your mind, the formula is in section 4 of the legislation:  https://www.ontario.ca/laws/regulation/050535"
1018906,AKRISONER,2017-12-06 19:32:00,5558, https://www.theweathernetwork.com/news/articles/ontario-government-wants-to-double-gasoline-ethanol-by-2020/90322/  Sorry i was reading a different article.
1018913,porkpie,2017-12-06 20:48:00,2521,"At this point in time, Canadian tire premium as well as Costco premium are ethanol free at all stations.  Will this change in the future?  I hope not."
1018914,lew,2017-12-06 21:10:00,12766,UltraMar premium is also ethanol free.
1018924,GBW,2017-12-06 22:37:00,8460,I've seen the same delivery truck at the Esso and the Can Tire in Lindsay.
1018927,gaspumper,2017-12-06 22:51:00,393,"When a delivery truck fills at the gas depot ,the depot blends the gas for which ever company they are delivering to.Some trucks pick up at the Belleville depot on Tank Farm Rd., and deliver any where in Ontario to any company."
1018928,Dutch,2017-12-06 22:53:00,831,Gas excise tax should go down as well as gas prices then since we are essentially paying for water and not fuel.
1018944,DRIFTER_016,2017-12-07 01:22:00,10439,Only Nestle gets free water!!!!
1018950,Old Ironmaker,2017-12-07 03:08:00,8243,"Apparently my 2011 Silverado can run on up to 80% Ethanol fuel.  For how long before the fuel system gets pooched I can't guess. They must have it south, certainly not here in Ontario. I must drive an extra 70K to buy Shell V Power for the boat and it ain't cheap. Dairy farmers out here are ditching the Bovine and selling the corn for fuel, better ROI I'm told. I would love to know what the total Carbon footprint is for transporting and processing the millions of tonnes of corn needed to turn it into fuel? I can remember the outcry when we went to Lead free. Same bee ess different century. I can't get Ethanol free gas in town but Tim Horton's has a plug in spot for electric cars there, what a joke we live in here in Ontario. It's not that I don't want to see us further pollute this World but it is us that has to pay and pay now for the sins of our Fathers."
1018952,GBW,2017-12-07 03:46:00,8460,Our father's father's and all those before them.  We didn't have the info we had even in the 70's as we do now so those working to the 'new world era' have to work with what we had and now have.  I hate the idea too as it means my boat that has been rather bullet proof for the last 10+ years may cost that much more to run and more down time to fix and new issues.  *ARGH*
