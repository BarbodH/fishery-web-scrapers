1018770,boombap,2017-12-03 20:54:00,310,Did some searching but couldn't find much on here.. did the new layout mess with the searching or something? A friend and I are looking to do a 1 week trip to lake of the woods May/June 2018. We are looking for resorts with guides and catered meals. Will be primarily after bass and musky... maybe some pike. Any recommendations? Thanks.

Great people, great place, and the fishing was great too. Scenery is out of this world. We targeted musky for the week and we all put good fish in the boat, my biggest was 48"". My son got his PB at 45, and my buddy also got a PB on the same day. Not to mention a bunch of real good gators as well. If you are going at that time of year, I assume you are wanting walleye, and you can catch limits right off the dock. along with TONS of JUMBO perch.  I can't wait to go back!!  S."

1018824,boombap,2017-12-04 22:13:00,310,Thanks everyone. Will be giving Pat a call soon. Anyone else I should look into?
1018845,Gregoire,2017-12-05 14:56:00,1397,"Look into Wiley Point Lodge http://wiley.totemresorts.com/. In my opinion it is the best place to stay in terms of location and amenities on LOTW by a large margin, but It is not the most economical. Keep in mind that if you want to target musky the season does not open up until the 3rd Saturday in June on LOTW."
1018846,grt1,2017-12-05 15:00:00,638,"take a look at the regs for the area, musky are only opening the 3rd saturday of june. so if you are aiming for them in may you will be in violation of the law"
