1019549,Sinker,2017-12-14 14:17:00,8692,Thats a great contact to have. I can't seem to find one lol.  S.
1019550,Old Ironmaker,2017-12-14 14:27:00,8243,I have seen wood stoves and inserts in the States that have a NG burner in the unit to light the wood. I have never come across a unit like that here. Does anyone have 1?
1019614,pics,2017-12-15 14:30:00,1268,"If you call the tree companies, they may have a call list that they will put you on...I will be looking for more in the new year even though I have 2 more years worth of wood....You never know when a good thing will come to an end...."
1019617,dave524,2017-12-15 15:17:00,4508,"I had a tree removed due to storm damage a month ago, they piled it on the side street( corner lot) and it was gone in 3 or 4 days with an add on KIJIJI , even though it was Willow . I had to call when it was gone and he took the add down."
1019627,Mister G,2017-12-15 16:44:00,1429,Good campfire wood.....
1019821,ch312,2017-12-17 17:09:00,1590," Jeez, we get blasted by the wind from fields on 3 sides and still only use what you have stacked at the end of the sea cans all winter. I could care less how much propane costs, if I used that much wood I wouldn't mind spending the money to heat with propane. How or why do you use so much wood? Last year I spent $80 on hardwood 3x3's to heat all winter and had a 3' square pile left. This year, all free trees from Kijiji and I was even paid to remove some. Those 3x3's are awesome as they're dry, clean, and stack nice and tidy while producing extremely little ash."
1019845,irishfield,2017-12-17 21:27:00,26272,"3 zero clearance fireplaces in the house (5700 sq ft), 2 that we use and that I barely let go out and a wood stove in my 1800 sq foot work shop. As noted earlier, a bush cord of wood costs me about 5 bucks in gas/oil and chain wear .. and a lot of work that keeps me in shape. I could cut wood everyday for the next 2 months and just keep up with the dead falls and diseased trees in our hardwood forest."
1019894,ch312,2017-12-18 16:45:00,1590,"I hadn't considered more than one fireplace being in the house. Is that 5700 sq ft the footprint of your house or total living space with all floors combined? Between cutting, splitting, stacking and moving the firewood indoors combined with maintaining said fireplaces, you're likely nearing full time weekly hours to heat the house. A lot of work, but I would hate to see the propane or oil bill if you heated that way.  Have you used propane or oil to heat the house? Just curious what that amount of wood translates into one of the other heating fuels to heat for the winter to compare costs."
1019905,irishfield,2017-12-18 19:03:00,26272,"Oh, I have a 125,000 BTU oil furnace in the house too, wood just keeps the consumption/bill down a tad. In the shop I have an electric 6KW heater that keeps the shop at 48F (60F when I have TIG work to do) and I stoke the stove while I'm working out there and just before I quit for the day. Combined.. 2 story + full basement that has about 45' of windowed walk out to the yard. Sure wood's a PI TA, but it's good exercise and for me at least basically free. A bush cord cut, split and piled is about 8 hours work. So a Fall/Winter's burn is about a FULL weeks worth of work on the original piling to dry and the wife has always been right there beside me piling. Once it's dried for 2 years, we put a bush cord at a time into the basement and that does two things. Adds a bit of moisture to the house and it dries the wood out completely for burning. We're about half way through our second house loading. Those go pretty quick, load the Kubota bucket from the pile, drive to the sliding basement door and re-pile inside. If we ever finish off the basement (been in the house 20 years) not sure what we'll do... lol Fireplace maintenance to date, a door rope on 2 out of 3 for a better seal. Nothing else. We've inspected, video'd, etc the two insulated chimney's on the Napolean zero clearances and we have ZERO issues and they've never had a cleaning brush down them since installed in '96. I was on the roof last Fall with a 10 million candle power looking down both stacks to see zero creosote build up in the top 30' or so and my 12' inspection camera from the bottom showing the same. Chimney from basement is 40' long and main floor 30', both running side by side through a chimney enclosure to the last 2.5 feet of stack. Don't smolder a fire and burn good wood, and thing stay simpler. I also use a couple of the ""CSL""  creosote ""logs"" each season that help clean the chimney. That said, my old shop stove (that came out of my grandmas parlour in Gooderham)... I throw the 25' of chimney away about every 5 years. It goes through the shop wall and from there as soon as the smoke hits the cold pipe its creosote city! "
1019907,Sinker,2017-12-18 20:09:00,8692,"By burning wood I save about $60/month on my gas bill. I'm not saving much money, but I like having a fire, and i enjoy the work cutting/splitting/stacking. There is nothing like walking into a wood heated home in my eyes. Its just a different kind of heat that I love. I load a bush cord at a time into my basement through a built in chute into my basement about once every 4-5 weeks, depending how cold it is, and how much I'm home. If someone is in the house, the fire burns 24/7.  I use 3-4 cords a year, mostly oak, some maple and ash. Gas bill right now is about $80/month with a gas hot water tank, and heating. 1500sq/ft split level bungalo with finished rec room where the wood stove is. S."
1019218,captpierre,2017-12-10 21:00:00,2521,"Here in York Region you can buy seasoned hardwood  firewood at Lowe’s, CT, Home Hardware etc. I often count the split pieces and it usually costs between  50 cents and a dollar a piece!  And that doesn’t include delivery. I guess it’s mainly people who use it for looks than heating that buy this stuff. I’m sure it’s cheaper to heat with propane unless you can source your wood for considerably less."
1019220,Old Ironmaker,2017-12-10 21:27:00,8243,"The only accurate way to pre determine if a gas fireplace will do the job of heating your place entirely is to do an accurate heat loss calculation. If you know how to use a tape measure and know all the construction hat will give you the BTU's required. Heat loss calculators are free on the net. The 50,000 unit could not keep up so we had to supplement with electric in the rooms at the back, 1 bedroom and bathroom. When the wind was blowing off lake and it was -10C or so we slept upstairs in the loft, it was hot up there. After those 2 terrible winters 3 and 4 years ago we finally bit the bullet and installed a direct vent hi efficiency NG furnace and ran duct work through the floor of the upper loft. Now all the rooms are crispy warm and zero electric heaters to supplement. I bought the 80,000 BTU or so  unit wholesale and all the ductwork wholesale as well. I didn't tear out drywall we ran the registers in the ceilings. My brother installed it for the family price, not free though, and it was less than another gas fireplace. In my opinion a forced air furnace is far better then any single gas fireplace as primary heat. A wood stove trumps a NG fireplace for primary heat. A fireplace cranked can not give you anymore BTU than it is rated for. Log burning  is giving off 900F, a gas unit will never reach that. The bonus of forced air is cleaner air and humidified air,  plus I can add central A/C.

1019223,irishfield,2017-12-10 22:16:00,26272,Red Oak and Maple costs me about $5 per bush cord in gas/oil... and 8 hours of hard labour! Somewhat less when the better half is helping..

But then again you don't live south of Buffalo NY as we do so I guess it depends how cold it gets up there and it gets cold. There is a guy that has a place in Turkey Point and he brought up 3 huge Palm trees in his 53' trailer 15 years ago. He sticks them in the ground ever year then I guess stores them someone warm over the winter. I convinced my B-I-L from Halifax they grew here, he passed on that info to his beys down home."

1019298,fish_fishburn,2017-12-11 18:53:00,1311,Yep there comes a time when we  all get to old to haul wood and carry by the armload into the house. I have been doing it since I was old enough to carry wood My stove is in my living room so its easy for me no basement stairs. I am 56 yrs old and will probably do it for another ten years or so. That's as long as the cost doesn't get much higher. This year I paid 300.oo for a full chord of red oak split and dried for a year and a half. I use three chords on average per winter.
1019299,ch312,2017-12-11 18:54:00,1590,"We have a quality wood insert (Pacific Energy) in the house we bought two years ago and we are loving it as it's super easy to control and is very efficient. Three wheel barrow loads of split wood last about 10-14 days so it's not too time consuming loading up the basement with wood every couple weeks or so and with it's large firebox I am using larger than normal pieces of wood for longer burn times. I do not bother with kindling and just load the stove with some newspaper in the right spots and the fire is burning in no time. I use a Fiskars 8lb maul so splitting is effortless and the wood carrying bag practically eliminates the mess inside. I could see someone older wanting to switch to propane, but being younger and having such a great insert I can't see myself getting rid of it any time soon. I'm not a fan of propane prices fluctuating so much between the seasons (nearly $.20/l between summer and winter) so my goal is to use as little propane as possible. I think our 2 year old high efficiency propane furnace has been on 3 times int he last year?   "
1019303,jimmer,2017-12-11 20:05:00,2730,"I sure wish I could talk my wife into switching from wood to propane.  I can't stand the mess of the wood and the dust it creates in the house, never mind the affects it has on our lungs."
1019306,SirCranksalot,2017-12-11 20:29:00,3291,"If you have a wood stove you shouldn't be smelling(or breathing in) smoke, or do you mean when you go outside?"

The mess in the yard sucks, but thats my wifes job lol.  The neatly stacked firewood is a thing of beauty. I also scored about 3 cords of maple for $300. I had to go pick it up, but still a great deal. I have a chute in my garage that goes to a wood room in my basement, so filling the wood room is pretty easy. Once its inside there isn't a lot of mess.  S."
1019314,jimmer,2017-12-11 21:24:00,2730,I mean the dust that comes from it when cleaning out the ashes or loading it up.
1019315,jimmer,2017-12-11 21:25:00,2730,It is a challenge to find good wood at a reasonable price. I just can't handle doing log lengths anymore.
1019317,pics,2017-12-11 21:26:00,1268,I have a tree company that supplies me for wood.. They text me the address and I go pick it up. I bought a splitter from Canadian tire for a grand and so far my buddy and I have split 20 face cords.. I have a high efficiency wood insert but they don't seem to heat like a wood stove can.. Either way the gas fireplace upstairs and the insert downstairs has the house warm enough that the furnace is still turned off..
1019320,SirCranksalot,2017-12-11 21:59:00,3291,Here's a trick I use when cleaning out: I lite up some paper or cardboard in 1 corner. It creates enough draft up the chimney to take most all the dust with it. I don't get much dust at all when loading. 
1019118,lew,2017-12-09 10:59:00,12766,"When I bought this home 8 years ago it had a wood burning fireplace in the living room and it was really nice. I found a wood supplier at a good price and loaded up.  The next year I decided I wanted a stove downstairs in the family room too and seeing as I was using wood anyways I went with an airtight wood stove.  It worked great and threw off enough heat that it migrated upstairs and heated the whole house.  Hauling the wood 70' from the shed wasn't a problem as I  like hard work anyways but I was getting a bit tired of the constant mess carrying it thru the house, specially the living room,  so after 2 years I decided to switch over to a propane insert in the living room and reface the fireplace while I was at it.  The new propane insert works great, looks nice and throws off a ton of heat even with the blower off so I decided to get rid of the wood stove downstairs and go with propane there too. I used it for the 1st time this past week and it's also excellent and I'm happy I made the switch.  I'll be the 1st to admit a natural wood burning stove or fireplace looks and even smells  nicer, but the new, modern appliances are pretty darned nice too plus I'm not constantly cleaning up the mess and hauling ashes out every few days. Simply pushing a button to start them is soooo much easier than hauling wood, splitting kindling, tending the fire and the constant cleaning. They also come with a thermostat so it's very easy to maintain a comfortable room temperature which isn't always so easy with wood. Just thought I post my opinions incase anyone is trying to decide between wood or gas."

1019132,crappieperchhunter,2017-12-09 16:48:00,2582,Looks good Lew. We still have wood. Debbe especially loves the wood stove. You just can't get the same heat from gas or propane IMHO. But you are 100% correct about the extra work and the mess. We will probably travel the same road some day but for now wood is still winning.
1019136,lew,2017-12-09 17:29:00,12766,"Thanks boyz. Steve, I hear you about not as much heat from propane and you're correct but what I like about the propane stoves is you can control the heat with the thermostat just like a furnace whereas a wood stove or fireplace can drive you outta the room until it burns down a bit. I figure once the room gets up to a comfortable temperature anything else is just too much heat. We have a big Christmas party every year and tonight's the night, and I clearly remember the 1st couple years with the wood fire upstairs and 30 people yelling at me to put the fire out...it's too darned hot in here LOL After spending the last 8 years experiencing both wood and propane stove, I find propane suits me more but obviously everyone has their own likes & dislikes.

1019142,crappieperchhunter,2017-12-09 19:15:00,2582,I know exactly what your talking about Lew. We have 3 family birthday parties during the winter and the whole gang for Christmas as well. A big group of people... the stove and oven going all afternoon up in the kitchen...woodstove downstairs.....it gets a little too warm sometimes. Have it figured out pretty good now....but in the beginning it was quite the sweat shop more then a few times.
1019171,captpierre,2017-12-10 01:43:00,2521,Nice going Lew Been thinking of replacing the air tight wood burning fireplace at the cottage for the same reason. Tired of the mess and having it go out during the night. Was wondering how well the propane inserts heated compared to the stand alone models like you put in the basement. Seems the later would be more efficient since heat  would radiate from all around the unit. What do you think? And can you give me an idea what both units cost installed? Thanks  
1019173,bigbuck,2017-12-10 02:42:00,2449,We are kicking around the idea of putting in a propane wood looking stove in the basement up at the cottage. Anything beats baseboards these days.....
1019174,Old Ironmaker,2017-12-10 02:59:00,8243,"You and Mrs. Lew have a very nice shack there Lew, and it is next to Burleigh Falls which was one of my favorite places in the entire world.  I bet Lovesick Lake Camp is more than 10 bucks a night now, if it still exists. My wife makes custom slip covers and did them for the love seat and chesterfield that match yours. My former wife forbad me from sitting let alone lay on her former 500 count Egyptian Cotton livingroom furniture, the last time she told me that I didn't see her until we met in court. As far as wood vs. gas there definitely is a different feel even though 1 degree of heat is 1 degree. Especially a stand alone wood burner vs. gas set into a wall or the corner. It feels hotter because it may be. It may be 90F and you would most likely never set gas at 90 and there will be times your wood will give off 90F, or more. Plus  gas is, clean, labour free, set the temp and walk away for 12 months. Rather than fight to get it lit every fall I just leave the pilot lit all year. Something like 5 bucks a month cost and there are some cool summers morning I will turn it on if just to take the dampness out of the air. I do service it myself every year though but don't need to fight to relight it. The most I miss about wood is simply the smell. When I am outside and a neighbour has the wood stove going it brings back some memories, great memories. We would come out in the dead of winter, light the wood stove and head into Dover for some Perch and come back to a toasty warm Cottage, that we miss."
1019176,crappieperchhunter,2017-12-10 03:29:00,2582,Like I said to Lew...Debbe is way more attached to the wood stove then I am.  She absolutely loves the smell and earning her girl scouts badge starting a fire. I do ALL the labor....hauling the wood in.... chopping the kindling...but man she rocks the fire starting part I think she was a pyro in her last life. Plus she has always loved the heat. Your right about the 90F because I betcha it's at least that warm in my family room right now which is why I'm up here in the kitchen in shorts and a T shirt and she's downstairs with a glass of wine enjoying one of her shows on Fibe TV or whatever you call it. It all comes back to Happy wife Happy life.
1019178,Old Ironmaker,2017-12-10 04:14:00,8243,"You got that right CPH. Happy Wife= Peace and quiet. Wine helps too. Just thought of this. Like I have said here before my good pal has a very large building out here that has turned into a hobby Marine. The insulated section of the building is about 40' X 60' X 20' high. It is totally insulated except the floor, well insulated with closed cell spray 6"" in the walls behind 8"" block. Up to last week it was heated with a very large wood stove. He was burning 1/2 a cord minimum a week last year. He is blessed to have 10 acres of bush. Last week the guy came in and hooked up overhead tube heater. What a difference. With the wood stove at the back of the shop you could see your breath and near the wood burner you had to take your coat off. Now it is 66F everywhere. I know that because I walked around with a thermometer Friday. So 1 difference is that there is fairly equal heat through out the space. Another thing I want to mention is that most gas fireplaces have problems with burning out the bearings in the internal fan blowers, no way on mine to simply change a bearing or small drive motors. Majestic anyway sells you a complete system with a new turbine complete with external outlet that is not needed.  Lots of heat to contend with inside the unit. After the second fan kit on my Majestic unit at $225.00 per I decided to leave it as is and simply put a fan on the floor. It probably worked better to move the heat. When we had the Sunroom business we also sold gas fireplaces on the side. I told the supplier about me going through a fan every 2 or 3 winters. He told me to insulate the bearing and small motor with heat tape to protect it. I never did this as I never replaced the turbine blower. It sounds logical. A big argument when it comes to moving heat with a ceiling fan is, clockwise or counter clockwise, especially with a vaulted ceiling. Building Science .com says pull the heat up to create some kind of vortex that creates a greater volume of air moved, (they are scientists) I say one you start to circulate warm air it doesn't mater. Argue amongst yourselves."
1019187,Big Cliff,2017-12-10 10:17:00,6899,"We did the same thing at Snug Harbour Lew, started with a wood fire place, went to an air tight  then after a few years switched that to propane. I actually found that the propane ended up costing less than the wood in the long run especially if you figured your labour into the mix. Good choice!"
1019192,lew,2017-12-10 12:05:00,12766,"The new propane stand alone doesn't give off huge amounts of heat from the sides or back and can be installed fairly close to the walls but throws out a ton of heat through the front vent with the fan on. My gas insert is the same and also throws out a crazy amount of heat, specially when set on high flame with the fan on and even on the lowest flame setting without the fan it's nice. My main floor is about 1500 sq. ft. and mainly open concept and it easily keeps it warm. I'd say the biggest advantage of the insert for your living room is the fact that you could probably get one to fit right in where your wood insert already is and you won't be taking up any more space like you would with the stand alone. Prices vary greatly depending on size and make but figure on probably being north of $5000 all in. Chemong Chimneys in Bridgenorth is who I dealt with and I'd highly recommend them if you're serious about switching. Outstanding company and people and I know others who say the exact same thing."
1019197,SirCranksalot,2017-12-10 14:04:00,3291,We have a wood stove. It's kind of messy and a lot of work but so far my wife and I both like it.  OI--the best way to move the heat is to stick a fan on the floor in the corner of the room furthest away from the stove. That way you are pushing the cold air toward that stove and helping the natural circulation. Ceiling fans just stir up the warm air regardless of which way they rotate 
1019198,Mister G,2017-12-10 14:14:00,1429,Our wood burning stove is a convection stove that draws in the heat naturally and no fan is need to heat the house. Great way to build it and I wonder why more are not built this way..... this is the stove we have in our living room. http://www.lopistoves.com/product-detail.aspx?model=208 Another thing is that we don't vent the pipe out the wall but instead out the ceiling as it's a single story ranch house. This way even more heat is being distributed because the pipe is also hot before it leaves the living space.
1019199,SirCranksalot,2017-12-10 14:22:00,3291,"Ours is similar and likewise goes thru the ceiling. Whether a fan is 'needed' or not is a matter of opinion. My wife complains if I 'overshoot' and put too much wood in(I think I could peel the paint in the living room if I went right to town with the wood! ), but then again she doesn't like the sound and the 'draft' of a fan tucked away in the far corner!! But she 'loves' the stove. Go figger!!!"

I kinda like it, and try not to kill myself doing it, but it is a lot of work. The stove burns 24/7 here unless we aren't home. S."
