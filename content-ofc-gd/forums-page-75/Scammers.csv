1019621,Fisherman,2017-12-15 15:38:00,7201,"Got a text this morning from 1-705-493-1735 indicating they were sending me money.  Click on www.etransfer-interac.ml to receive your refund.  .ml is Mali, somewhere out there in the jungle.  Bunch of baboons thinking I pull my pants up with vice grips."
1019628,misfish,2017-12-15 16:50:00,29133,"Vise grips work, when there's no tag to pull up the zipper."
1019639,Terry,2017-12-15 17:57:00,14456,"yeah, i got the very same one"
1019640,BillM,2017-12-15 17:58:00,17367,My mom called me yesterday about an email from Paypal saying she sent someone $140...  'Click here to login and verify' heh.
1019648,aplumma,2017-12-15 18:47:00,6896,My latest one was a message from my phone number that my account shows suspicious activities and to log in  using my password to verify my gps location.  Art
1019685,dave524,2017-12-16 00:37:00,4508,"I just get "" Window's Technical Dept"" saying there is a problem with my computer,  some chick with important info about my present credit card balance ( never says which card ) and our daily air duct cleaning services with an AngloSaxon name and a heavy Punjabi accent"
1019706,SirCranksalot,2017-12-16 02:51:00,3291,"Just watched a Marketplace episode about ducts etc and how ""effective"" the ""Do Not Call List"" is!!(Doesn't really qualify as news, though!) "
1019722,Fisherman,2017-12-16 13:07:00,7201,"Quite the episode, the do not call list is pretty much a waste of time.  I'm sure the duct monkeys have us all on speed call via Pakistan or India.  Every day it's a different number."
1019724,fisherman7,2017-12-16 13:27:00,325,Had the same text message yesterday. Just hit delete!
1019758,DanD,2017-12-16 19:12:00,2223,"Yeah I get those emails all the time. I also have a next door neighbour that is, well just say sketchy; with his conduct. The last email i got for duct cleaning, I replied but gave his address and sat back to watch the fun. A day or two later a truck shows up and pulls into his driveway. After a few minutes there's a bunch of yelling and he's (neighbour) is  chasing the guy back to the truck. I have no idea what he was yelling; it was all in Lebanese. But I know for sure it wasn't inshallah (God willing) Unless he was asking god to help kill the poor sales man. LOL Dan."
1019773,mukluk,2017-12-16 22:01:00,196,Would agree with  (pretty much a waste of time).   Something like our Senate and our CRTC.
1019778,Fisherman,2017-12-16 22:30:00,7201,Most definitely.
1019844,Old Ironmaker,2017-12-17 21:03:00,8243,"The Canadian ""do not call"" thing is a private endeavor, not a Gov. mandated thing like the US. It has been talked about here before. And they know that. I am constantly bombarded by someone with a thick accent that says his name is Bob telling me I have a problem with my computer. I tell him I don't own one, I have fun with these people. If you waste enough of their time they will put you on their ""No call list."""
