1018359,Joeytier,2017-11-28 01:48:00,3990,"Spent the weekend in the bush enjoying the early onset of winter in certain parts of the north, broke trail through some fresh powder and punched a lot of holes on a few lakes that we were lucky enough to be the first ones out onto this season.  Fishing was mostly excellent, as first ice almost always is, and my first landed fish happened to be an absolute beast, and my PB brook trout by a pretty large margin. I am not endorsing widespread safe ice in northern Ontario, don't be an idiot. https://imageshack.com/a/rhbl/1 20171125_142235.mp4"
1018360,chris.brock,2017-11-28 01:56:00,4053,Holy Christ that first one is a beauty specimen! It must have felt pretty good to get back out on the hard water again.
