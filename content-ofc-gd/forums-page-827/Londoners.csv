356367,Twocoda,2009-06-28 15:31:00,4130,head down to springback park and work from the dam to storybook gardens
356373,Beats,2009-06-28 16:06:00,543,IF you can't find carp and suckers in the Thames then you are doing it wrong   Greenway park area is always good as is the lower side of any dam.
356379,shane,2009-06-28 16:20:00,652,"If you don't like the in town spots, you could try Fanshawe dam. Either below the dam or above it. Lots of carp."
356383,justin-salmon,2009-06-28 16:26:00,17,i cant remember but dont you need to pay to fish at Fanshawe?
356386,Twocoda,2009-06-28 16:34:00,4130,not if you fish from the bridge on Clark in to the dam ....might pick up some fish if you do walk in ..
356387,Beats,2009-06-28 16:34:00,543,"  Well, I think it's 5$/person or 10$/car to get into the park, but you could park out at Clarke Rd and walk to the lower dam if you really wanted to skip the fee."
