355791,Jonny,2009-06-26 00:24:00,1380, Cool. Your avatar has me wondering too. It looks kind of like an African woman holding up laundry. And she has WWI flying googles on her head.  Am I close?
355804,Woodsman,2009-06-26 00:49:00,1286,Honestly I believe using your real name is only opening you up to possible problems. If you had a disagreement on the forum with a less than upright individual with your real name & by reviewing your profile or past posts it would be easy to determine where you live. This is more info than I am comfortable giving out to those I never meet. Over the last few years I have had the pleasure to meet with more than a few members here and everyone one of those have been given my real name if requested. I do not hide my first name as I often sign off with it. And I have not even touched on the possible consequences that organizations such as P3TA may do with this information as I believe they and other such groups monitor many of these types of forums.  Best Wishes: Rick
355806,BillM,2009-06-26 00:50:00,17367,RICK I KNOW WHERE YOU LIVE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  
355815,Woodsman,2009-06-26 01:08:00,1286,Yeah within about a 100 square miles. Without my full name and other resources you would have some work ahead of you to actually find out where I live. One member here has been to my house though.  Rick
355819,stan_133,2009-06-26 01:18:00,77,Whats next. i'll have to provide my driver license number or mail in a copy of my birth certificate to prove my real name. keep things the way they are and if you feel like posting your real name then post it. but don't force people to post there names if they don't want to.

356122,JohnF,2009-06-26 21:56:00,3494," I used to use my company email addy in a newsgroup that was renowned for it's argumentative nature. It never occurred to me that my innocuous posts would draw anyone's ire, but they did. One of the posters from Florida pm'ed me asking if I thought it was wise to use my company's name in posts that the world could see. I replied ""Ehh"". He gave me a kind of lecture about how the real world operated (real world to him being the internet, which spoke volumes) but I decided that discretion being the better part of valour I should cease and desist dragging my company's good name throught the mud of that particular newsgroup. He must have been impressed as he availed hisself of my services when it came time to buy a property in Canada, even though it wasn't in my own back yard. That proves it pays to suck up.  Sometimes I think we read too much into the power of the internet. That being said, we perhaps also give it too little weight. Does that make any sense at all?

On the other hand most of the regulars here have pretty much figured out who's who by now. We even refer to each other by real names rather than nicks most of the time.

Yes 15,000 posts, one of our top vetern members.  Needless to say he posted inappropriate material from time to time and was reported and fired from his job froma  client.  The client was googling the company and came across his account.  I don't like people hiding behind a keyboard either, but this is the internet and being anonymous definitely has its pros."
355269,charlesn,2009-06-24 19:28:00,551," Agree with you wholeheartedly TJ.  If you think about it, why would anyone post anything on here (or another board) that they don't want to sign their name to?  And if they were forced to sign their name to it, would some of the inflammatory or racist or other disruptive type of stuff happen as frequently?  I'm guessing the answer is that a lot of the crap would go away.  Could be wrong, we could just end up with 450 John Smith's instead of nicknames...  I also agree that you would lose some users so it is a tough trade-off, but one I have seen as beneficial on some other forums.  Charles"

Some were given when we were younger and others took a lot of thought, humour and even some original thinking.  Our names were not chosen by ourselves or given to us after a few decades on this planet.  My first name is Daniel.  There are tons of those all over the place.  For some reason, in all the movies, the name ""Dan"" is never associated with a bad guy....which is nice but there is a limit to seeing the same name.  My nickname immediately shows that I like/play blues music.  Being on this site means I like fishing.  It sounds like a masculin name (very important) and there very few people use this nickname.  As for my true identity, I give it out freely for the asking."

A picture says a thousand words right.  I think there's a foot ball league out there that you can have a nickname on your jersy, rather then your real name (maybe not any more).  I guess it's ""fun"" to give yourself a cool nickname rather then your real name.  Either way, I think the choice should be up to the user.
