338753,RobHall,2009-05-06 16:34:00,261,"It's been several months since i last posted, so decided I was way overdue.    I've been busy with work and other stuff, so i havent been spending as much time on the forums lately.  A couple of weeks ago I wet my line for the first time in 2009.  We fished at the locks near Manotick (south of Ottawa) and caught a couple of small perch.  It was a great time with old friends.  I will be heading up to Lovesick Lake for 1 week this summer with some family and friends. We are arriving July 4th and will be staying at Forest Hill Lodge on Lovesick lake.  I will be spending a good amount of time on Stoney and Buckhorn as well. I'm almost all set for Musky gear (just need to get a 60"" frabill cradle).  I will be taking lots of pics and video.  Only 59 more sleeps.  I hope to boat a couple of toothy critters before i leave.    The map below shows were i'm staying.    I've never fished this part of the Trent Severn Waterway before and was wondering if some folks had any information/tips they could share on Lovesick, Stoney and Buckhorn Lakes or Forest Hill Lodge.  I have a few spots i have already marked based on information obtained from the Navionics HM 2009 lake contour maps for this region, but i'm always open for any tidbit of information i can get.  Thanks in advance for any help.  FOTB"
338800,ciceri,2009-05-06 19:00:00,535,"Camped there once with canoes, caught a load of smallmouth on jointed rapalas, and what i think was a muskie hit, nailed it! Also caught some walleye at the locks. It's not very big, and pretty rocky from what i remember, I would just fish everywhere if you have a boat."
338805,ozaibak1,2009-05-06 19:12:00,401,"Hey I typically fish Stoney Lake mostly, as well as some other Kawartha Lakes. I've been on Lovesick Lake 3 times now. It's a very scenic, and small lake. This means you should be able to cover the entire lake in two full days of fishing if you wanted to.  There are walleyes at the lock / dam, try to fish them early morning or around sunset for best results. Apart from that, just cast into the bays, and off of islands, shore... its a small enough lake that you could just fish it all!  I found fish sizes were much smaller than Stoney since its a lot shallower and smaller.  However, one thing I remember well. We were motoring back, and about 100 yards in front of us a HUGE fish surfaced. It was weird, it looked like it just floated up and was dead. When we were about 20 ft away from it, it dove back down!!  Didn't know what fish it was, it was FAT and not too long. Coulda been a 5pn+ bass, not sure, or maybe even a carp (more likely). Good luck!"
338809,Jacques,2009-05-06 19:14:00,97,Lots of bass in lovesick these days.  Muskie fishing is good -- I caught my first there and if I can do it then there's hope for everyone.  Walleye can be finicky and on the small side but fun when you get onto them.  Have fun.  It's a nice little lake.
338821,FLEX ROD,2009-05-06 19:53:00,394,"From what I remember, a healthy population of small muskies, but that is going back almost 20 years now.  FLEX"
339075,Jackie,2009-05-07 16:25:00,124,"Try to fish around the islands for both largemouth and muskie.  Look for the weeds.  It's a very scenic lake.  I'm sure you'll enjoy your stay there.  But be careful with the rocks.  Get a good map as I once steered off course and the rock ate my prop.  To fish the shallow area in the island area, it's best to use a canoe, imo.  The lake is small; a canoe can easily cover a good part of the lake in even one day."
339122,RobHall,2009-05-07 21:08:00,261,Thanks for the info folks.  I will be spending a fare bit of time on Buckhorn and Stoney.  Deer bay looks interesting.  Looking forward to this trip.  It can't come soon enough.  FOTB  
339295,Musky or Specks,2009-05-08 12:00:00,2710,I have caught a wack of smaller muskies there up to @44 inches. Most of my luck has come in the northwest part of the lake. At that time of the year burning bucktails across cabbage bed is very productive. Start at Rose Island in the NW part of the lake and work your way around to Beaver Island. Cast to all the cabbage and any good looking structure that you see
339347,tbayboy,2009-05-08 14:09:00,1497,I've been on Lovesick a couple times but never managed to do terribly well but there's lots of nice looking structure (up in the NW corner behind the islands for sure).  Here's some photos from the trips  Lovesick Sept 2007  Lovesick Aug 2007
339532,Billy Bob,2009-05-09 11:37:00,5865,Stayed a couple times at the Beachwood Inn on Lower Buckhorn Lake. Did pretty good with walleye in that bay that the lodge is on off of Lower Buckhorn Lake. Fish the weed edges with a black bucktail jig tipped with just a pinch of nightcrawler.
339639,RobHall,2009-05-09 18:26:00,261,Thanks again for the tips folks.  It's looking like my brother and i will be getting a crash course on Musky and Bass fishing on Lower Buckhorn by a local guide and member of this forum.  I'll be sure to take lots of pics and video.  Rob 
356155,Craig.O,2009-06-26 23:52:00,1,"Hey there,  New to the site... but I'll be on Lovesick at Forest Hill Lodge (I can't freaking wait) for the 2nd, 3rd and 4rth.  If I catch you before your gone I'll let you know how we made out.  Keep Reelin'"
356179,GoneFishin,2009-06-27 02:46:00,349,I got the bass in my display picture at love sick. It was in between the red cottage that is on an Island and wolf island.
356214,RobHall,2009-06-27 14:45:00,261," Welcome to OFC Craig.O.  I'm sure you will not get skunked so be sure to post some fish porn when you get back.  Everyone loves Fish porn.  Only 7 more sleeps.  I will be arriving on July 4th at around 2 or 3PM (check-in time) and driving a red ford ranger 4x4.  If ya see me let me know how you made out.  I'm staying in the 1 bedroom cabin.  Cheers,  FOTB"
356216,RobHall,2009-06-27 14:53:00,261," Nice bucket GoneFishin.    I hear the North West corner (weedy areas) is the best for Bass.  You might be talking about Rose Island, when you mention the red cottage.  Cheers,  FOTB"
356230,angrypigeon,2009-06-27 18:48:00,31,Hi guys - long time reader of the forum.  Great info and great people on the board.  Is there somewhere to launch a canoe on Lovesick Lake or on the north shore of Lower Buckhorn?
356323,Jackie,2009-06-28 04:08:00,124, For Lovesick Lake you can launch right at Burleigh Falls.  There is parking and washroom there.
