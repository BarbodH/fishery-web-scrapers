After a few minutes with the  power on the transformer starts to make a squealing noise.Still everything works but the transformer box starts to get hot. I asumed it was the fan that died,but I pulled out the box and replaced the fan and the exact thing is still happening. Is it the circuit board in the teransformer ? Do I have to replace the whole transformer?  If anyone knows of a site that could answer my questions please post  thanks."

Some of the older units require a good battery to be hooked up otherwise the converter goes into warp drive.  It appears by your description that the converter is trying to power ""something"" that's taking a lot of power and then causing the overheat. There most likely is a circuit board, but whether it's a modern 3 stage unit or basic 13.8V DC battery burner depends on age of the unit."
