356208,Greencoachdog,2009-06-27 14:07:00,8163,"I was highly offended Beansy!!!... that lille rant didn't say one bad thing aboot Rednecks!!!  (Ilive for the abuse yanno!  )  I know exactly how you feel about having to miss the Lakair G2G!!!  All those lucky turds up there fishing, cavorting, and carrying on!... I hope the bugs eat them up real good this year and they all have a mild case of skull cramps when they wake up tomorrow morning!!!"
356212,ecmilley,2009-06-27 14:40:00,2163,"I am not offended, in fact I am usually the one doing the offending."
356213,Terry,2009-06-27 14:45:00,14456,"well I was offended, the only way you can make it right is for us to go fishing some time      so what was it that offended me........LOL"
356234,Big Cliff,2009-06-27 19:46:00,6899,"Oh, and I thought you didn't go to Lakair so you could stay here and help me slime the new boat, now I find out that you didn't go to Lakair for other reasons? Now I am deeply offended!  Just checked the weather forecast for tomorrow, 60% chance it won't rain on us, a little cool, (I need a brake from the heat after this past week)winds light and out of the South @ 10k sounds like a perfect morning for fishing, I know you like to sleep in but does 8:00 am sound ok to you? We'll fish until about noon if the weather holds for us, I know your back bothers you if you are at it too long and we can come in earlier if you need to.  Oh, btw, liked that post of yours"
