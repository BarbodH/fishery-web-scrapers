By the way, I hear conflicting stories. If a C.O. checks the length of your fish, is it with the fish's tail in a natural position, or is the tail squeezed out to maximum length? I tend to measure the bottom of the slot with the tail squeezed out and the top of the slot with the tail natural, just to be on the safe side... but if I were sure, that wouldn't be necessary."
