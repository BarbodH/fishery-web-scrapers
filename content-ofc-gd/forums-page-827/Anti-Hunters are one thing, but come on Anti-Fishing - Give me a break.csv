When people try to defend the sport of fishing by pointing out that others are not perfect because they eat meat or some such thing...this is pointless.  I obviously don't agree...but any P3TA-head with half a brain would counter that just because he or she has accepted the harvest and consumption of meat products for sustenance doesn't mean that they can't be opposed to a pastime which they view as being unnecessarily cruel.  Before the flame war starts...like I've already stated...I don't agree with that opinion, I'm just stated the obvious response any tree-hugger with basic reasoning abilities would counter with.  One could oppose 99% of what organizations like P3TA stand for, while still finding certain common ground with even the most hard-line of animal lovers.  Just because P3TA is against something...it doesn't mean they're automatically way off base.  For example, I'm pretty sure not too many of us would support dog fighting to the death for sport...P3TA member or not."

355995,bigreddog,2009-06-26 17:01:00,84,"On a more serious note, it might be worthwhile to have a conversation about all the good that many anglers and hunters are responsible for.  Getting out there means that we see what's happening with the environment, with the animals and plants, and their populations.  It also means that if we want to keep hunting and angling, we have a vested interest in making sure that the environment stays or is restored to the best condition possible.  There are a lot of interest groups out there (trout unlimited, ducks unlimited, credit river anglers association, OFAH) that are not only interested in just hunting and fishing, but are actively engaged in restoring and improving habitat for the very creatures they hunt and fish for, and the ecosystems they are a part of.  Tree planting, stream rehabilitation, actively lobbying private organizations and government agencies to change their development plans for the good of our precious natural resources are just a few of those activities.  Ultimately, the goal is to create sustainable resources that are healthy enough to prosper even while supporting hunting and fishing activities.  This is in contrast to some of the more militant animal rights ""activists,"" who are more focused on labeling and judgingothers, rather than rolling up their sleeves and doing something constructive to improve the world.  You can ask your colleague when the last time she planted a tree was.  (Of course, it's even better if you're actually involved with a group or in some of those activities yourself.)"

She is always trying to make me out as a horrible person for what I do.  This isn’t anything new though, there is lots of people who are vocally against hunters, and I’ve learned to deal with that.  I thought she was only like this with regards to hunting.  However, she is now starting to trash talk fisherman/woman for killing and eating fish.  (she doesn't eat fish herself)  I have a large repertoire to defend myself against anti hunters.  But I have never had to defend myself from someone who doesn't agree with fishing, and the act of cleaning, and eating a fish. (Which has been a part of my life since I could hold a fishing rod)  I need some good responses to tell her, and I can't think of any good ones.  There's lots of summer left, and I'm going to have to deal with this every time I talk about fishing in the office.

It's clear that humans used to be like every other animal struggling for survival and killing was part of it. It's fact. Yet people like such act as though we were put on the earth mere decades ago to all the luxuries we enjoy today, including not having to kill to survive. D.C Reid, a fishing writer, summed up this perspective well:  ""We live in a world, now, where most of us never had the life of another creature in our hands. We do not regularly kill. Remember though, before the 1950s most people had their own cows and chickens and when they wanted dinner, they butchered an animal. Every person knew that today's roast came from a stunned cow strung up by the sinews of its hind leg, its throat slashed so the blood could seep out in its copiousness. That is the way of the world. For many to things to live, they must kill other animals or plants. But over the decades, the activity of butchering has more and more become the basis of business rather than a killing each of us must do.  Our meat comes to us in sanitized, in clinical foam trays, with bright labels for payment. The meat is clean, neat, attractive. No guts. No hair disfiguring the cut. No sawdust. No crap. We have become separated from ourselves, separated from the reality that living necessitates killing.  Thus today, those who wish others to stop killing fish or other animals can sway opinion because all of us have become distanced from the killing our lives necessarily involve.""    There will always be those who can observe the wider perspective and those who believe they have the complete picture with only a view through narrow cracks. By understanding where this person is coming from, as many members here already do, your wider perspective already has you two steps ahead."

While we all (as anglers) despise having our rights and freedoms challenged and/or trampled on by these animal rights terrorists and their agenda (raising money for their leadership - check out their salaries), many of us will turn around and utilize the same form of ethical projection against fellow anglers that don't live by the same credo or fit our personal definition of an ethical angler.  I'm not talking about our united protests against poaching or illegal activities, I'm talking about the marginalization/demonization of completely legal fishing practices such as keeping copious amounts of little panfish in a white bucket or any other container, bow-hunting carp, fishing tournaments, fishing during the spawn, eating a musky, etc.  It's so easy to divide anglers, it's no wonder we lose access rights and see our angling opportunities at the whim of any politico looking to score easy points.  We fight with each other all the time.  When these AR terrorists such as ALF and P3TA are involved, we unite together and the bond (fishing) that holds us together is strong.  Yet many lose sight of that and would just as happily prevent another angler from enjoying their passion if it doesn't agree with their favored technique/species/season/area/etc.  Think of how strong the fishing lobby group should be compared to what it is.  8 million anglers in Canada.  That's a lot of votes and dollars spent each year.  I know my words won't change anything, but just something to think about for all of us that have fallen in to this trap."
