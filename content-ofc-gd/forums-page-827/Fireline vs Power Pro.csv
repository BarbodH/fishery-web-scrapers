So far, the problems with it have been few and far between...actually the only complaint I have is the black coating coming off almost instantly. I figured this would weaken the line considerably...it has not! I've been really running the crap outta this line to try and get it to fail...I haveb't been able to yet. I'm running 10 lb on my spinning reel. I can drag it across rocks and it will barely fray...and even after fraying I've purposely left it frayed and reeled in fish after fish with it and have yet to break the damned stuff!  If I were you guys I'd give it a shot...whats the worst that can happen? You dont like it and take it off after a day of fishing?"
353855,Garry2Rs,2009-06-20 14:26:00,1425,"The two fibers, Spectra and Dyneema, won't hold dyes.  Most companies use a powder ink type of colouring.  Powerpro uses wax.  Whatever the colouring agent,  it will come off with use.  This has no effect on the strength of the line. The old Fireline, that was fused, got hairy looking as ends of fibers split off and became loose from the herd.  Whatever loss of strength these loose ends represented, it was negligible, although it looked bad. I believe that all of the ""Pure Fishing"" braided lines, Fireline, Spidercast, Stren Microfuse etc. are made by the same third party company.  The reason I think this is because all of these labels came out with new lines made of Dyneema, with slightly different but very similar features, at the same time."
353904,Garnet,2009-06-20 17:03:00,2056,Spider Thread has no wax and is dyed before weaving so the color stays better and because there's no wax the weave is tighter ans stays tighter greatly reducing spool lock and wind knots.  Garnet

Recently spooled up my spinning outfit with 8lb Fireline after hearing positive reviews. My first Carp of the season broke my line yesterday, was surprised as I really didn't think I had the drag set that tight. I also dislike the Red Powerpro, seems more plasticy than I remember the moss green being."

It is the closest thing to an unfair advantage that I have seen since the gaff."

I just spooled 2 of my rods with Power Pro last night. 50lb on a MH baitcaster (slop-fishing, jig & pig, etc.) 20lb on a medium spinning set-up (worm, jig, senko, etc.)  I used to use Fireline a number of years ago, but stayed away from ""super-lines"" ever since. There was a lot of things I liked about the Fireline (sensitivity, no stretch or memory) but I found I broke a few rods and wore out a few cheap reels and the fraying was a constant challenge.  Now that I have some better equipment, I thought I would give the Power Pro a try. With just a few casts from the dock, so far I'm impressed. Tomorrow will be the test.  I think I'll stick with mono on my other rods for now and see how it compares."

Getting too many birdnests, and even made one cast with a brand new spinner for musky... 50ft out and in the air.. SNAP. Spool birdnested on me and snaped while in mid air.. go figure.. Only had the line on there a week or so!  Made some casts today with a 4"" Rapala, 3/8 Oz Jig, and a 5"" Shad Rap on Rice Lake. Awsome line, love it.. Gradually all 6 Spinning Reels will be moved over to PowerPro from mono like I did today with my baitcaster. And any other reels in the future!"
356200,jace,2009-06-27 10:07:00,472,  12 and 16 strand carrier?  but for what pound test and is that hollow core or solid?  Most lines are 4-8 strand until you get into seriously high tests where you get up to 16 strand.   I saw a few boutique lines last winter that were 12 and 16 strand but they were hollow and started at #50.  It was around $80USD for 100yards and I was tempted to try it only because that's the lightest hollow i've seen.
356203,Jonny,2009-06-27 13:22:00,1380," Great price for PP.  I'm going to try mine out on bass this afternoon and if it works well again (which it should), I think  I'll pick up another spool or two."

Last night I went throught the comments about Fireline and Power Pro.  There were lots of postive comments about both but there were more negative points about Fireline. I didn't copy out all the positive stuff. I thought any perceived negatives would be more interesting.  Here's some of what I found:   Good knots of course are important, especially with non-monofilament lines. Here's a very good site for that:  http://videofishingknots.com/basic-fishing-knots.html"

353610,jediangler,2009-06-19 19:00:00,1923,I like the Fireline for spinning rods. I use 8lb on my ultra-light and 15lb for my medium set up. I use Power Pro for baitcasters.

The line itself now almost looks like thread. I've caught everthing from small walleyes and bass to 40"" pike  with this stuff.  I do run power pro on my bait casters and like it too 30lb & 80lb but for the smaller braid I'm sticking to the fireline"
353629,Jonny,2009-06-19 19:43:00,1380,"I have never used Fireline, but the comment I see frequently is that the light tests will ""tuck under"" on your spool if you're fighting a large fish. So if you use a light test, do you always find that you have to back off on the drag to avoid that? In other words, try to avoid ""horsing"" a fish?"
353633,Hooked,2009-06-19 19:56:00,891,"I've used both, including the new Fireline Braid.  I like PP but I did experience issues casting PP with my spinning reel, wind knots....even when there was no wind, but I do use it trolling quite abit.  Found the regular fireline a little noisy going through the guides, and a little stiff, but still a pretty good line.  I was however extremely impressed with the new Fireline Braid.  Smoothest line I have ever used and casts great so far.  I would check it out."
353634,Fisherpete,2009-06-19 19:56:00,1814,"I used 8lb Fireline on my spinning setups for a few years, and found that it tended to get frayed very easily, leading to breaks. I have since switched to 20lb Powerpro on my light spinning, 30-50lb on the heavier spinning outfits, and LOVE the stuff. I also have 80lb on the baitcasters. Last year CTC had the Fireline Crystal on sale, so I could not resist and bought a couple spools of the 14lb, and same deal - it frayed very easily. I still have it on one of my reels, but find myself having to cut off the frayed sections and retie several times in the course of a day of fishing. I'm sticking to PP from now on."
353636,Rich Clemens,2009-06-19 19:57:00,3131,"I prefer Power Pro as well.    I spooled one of my bass outfits with Fire Line and had all kinds of trouble with it - a lot of fraying and it wasn't due to dragging across rocks and such.  This just could have been a bad batch or something.   I've never used it since (Switched to Stren for my bass outfits).   Now, my step-mother uses Fireline on her bass and ultra-lite outfits and just loves it .. and doesn't want to use anything else."

353674,Burning Babies,2009-06-19 21:34:00,150,"I like them both.  I've been using Fireline for over ten years on all my spinning rigs, without any issues.  It can start to look frayed quickly, but the multifilament design retains waaaay more strength than mono when it wears.  When I started using it and couldn't afford frequent line changes, I got a lot of mileage off frayed Fireline with virtually no break offs.  Since I started using mono and flouro leaders, I get a lot less fraying.  I've used Power Pro a bit for muskie fishing, and I like it fine.  It doesn't seem to have the abrasion resistance of Fireline, but I'm using totally different weights of line for totally different applications, so that may be an apples to oranges thing.  Lol at some of the reviews.  Many of the clowns posted have no business reviewing anything."

I put it on my new spincast outfit and I'm not thinking a lot of it. After 50 years of strictly trilene mono, its hard to change. I'm going to spool up some 8lb mono on the other spool just to be comfy again."
353720,Spiel,2009-06-19 23:02:00,9065,"I have reels loaded with Fireline from the first year it came out, I also have reels with PP and of course mono. Bottom line, used in the right application they're all good, get it wrong and it's all bad."
353723,Garry2Rs,2009-06-19 23:08:00,1425,"Fireline has two distinctly different products. One is fused and the other is a braid. The fused line is quite flat, the braid is made with eight strands and is round. Both lines are made from a fiber called Dyneema,  a Dutch company called DSM is the source.  Chemically it is the same or very simpler to Spectra, the fiber used for Powerpro.  Spectra is a Honeywell product. Spectra fans believe that it is a superior fiber...I agree, but what do I know?  Spectra lines have generally been made to a smaller diameter per pound test than Dyneema lines.  The way I heard it, the line making process was stolen and the thief only had first generation product knowledge.  Anyway the information was sold to the Japanese and they are the source of the non-Spectra lines.  There are several basic problems with Spectra/Dyneema lines. 1: Although the braids are super strong on a straight pull, the fiber is soft and will abrade easily. 2: The fiber is very slick, so it is hard to knot. 3: It is not anything like mono, so there is a learning curve. 4: Ten years ago, the major line companies spread lies about the new line because they were scared to death of it when it was coming to market.  The cure for #1 is to forget about pound test and use a line of the similar diameter to what you would have used in mono, until you figure out what works best for you.  Problem #2 requires learning a couple of good knots.  Problem #3 requires a little common sence...  Ten pound braid (or fused Fireline) is between 2 and 4 pound test mono diameter.  This means that it will cut off just as easily as two or four pound mono...see cure #1.  Braids are also very limp, so they handle differently than mono, which has a natural springiness.  Problen Four, the lies, is tough.  You still hear them all the time. Braid will cut the line guides...false Braid will dig into the spool...Not if the line is properly spool, and that means tightly spooled. Braid will slip on the arbour...False.  Leave a long tag end on your arbour knot.  The first row of wraps will anchor everything...and the list goes on.  The new Fireline braid is a very nice product.  But I have found a west coast source for multi-strand braid...I'm talking 12 to 16 strand braid...And it is cheaper than Fireline or Powerpro, plus it is made of Spectra fiber.  I like this new line better than either Powerpro or Fireline.  The only disadvantage is I have to buy it in 600 yard spools."
353727,Jonny,2009-06-19 23:24:00,1380," Well, it sounds like the guy DID learn... the hard way!  ""Man on the street"" opinions can be amusing, but there are sometimes things to take from them anyway.  I like the fact that some guys are just as dumb as I am when trying something new!"
