""Invitation"" from the Nature was spectacular   Fishing and catching  was pretty decent, few small LMB,  some pike ( traditionally two of them accepted invitation for fish fry contest) , and weather was still cooperating    Around 11:00 dark clouds started rolling in from NW. This time the weather man was right. O.K. few more casts and I'm gone. Couple min later reel starts ""screeming"" (I was trolling on my way to boat launch), but this time it was not a snag,  Few min later I've landed my new PB   ( 35"" / 8 lb 14 oz ) pike. After quick picture, went back in the water like a bullet, but I know where she lives  "
