356194,bigfish1965,2009-06-27 04:33:00,3382,"I do find it amusing that so many want newcomers to adapt to 'our culture' when our culture is a.) barely defined due to widespread regional variations b.) an amalgamation due to our efforts to be a cultural mosaic rather than the US style melting pot.  Canada is a very secular nation and that has served us very well. Freedom of religion and freedom from religion is hard to accomplish. There is no prayer in public schools...nor should there be. Gay marriage is legal and the earth did not swallow us whole. We built this country on one principal...TOLERANCE. Practise it. Your forefathers had a hard time giving up what they were used to and it likely took generations to get to where you are now. We do not have huge demonstrations bordering on rebellion, we do not see (these days) parts of the country seriously wanting to leave....cause we all just go about our business and do not spend too much time wondering or worrying what everyone else is up to. Thats tolerance."
356195,danc,2009-06-27 05:23:00,4677,Rick. You can go to bed now. I'm taking over on the graveyard shift. Be sure you're back at noon sharp for your next shift so I can get some sleep. Good thing that we're getting paid double time for all this work this weekend.      ZZZZZZZZzzzzzzzzzzzzzz...........
356056,Beans,2009-06-26 19:54:00,3339,"Received this from a fellow carper in the UK...but it can apply for my country...  CANADA !!!   TOTALLY TOTALLY AGREE    I think this really sums it all up.  After hearing that many cities did not want to offend other cultures by putting up Christmas lights, so DIDN'T!  After hearing that the Birmingham council changed its opinion and let a Muslim woman have her picture on her driver's licence with her face covered.  After hearing of a Primary School in Birmingham where a boy was told that for PE they could wear Football League shirts (Aston Villa, Birmingham, West Brom etc) but NOT an England shirt as it could offend others !  This prompted the editorial below written by a UK citizen. Published in a British tabloid newspaper.  IMMIGRANTS. NOT BRITONS, MUST ADAPT.  Take It Or Leave It. I am tired of this nation worrying about whether we are offending some individual or their culture. Since the terrorist attacks on London , we have experienced a surge in patriotism by the majority of Brits.  However, the dust from the attacks has barely settled and the 'politically correct' crowd begin complaining about the possibility that our patriotism is offending others.  there are a few things that those who have recently come to our country, and apparently some born here, need to understand.  This idea of London being a multicultural centre for community has served only to dilute our sovereignty and our national identity. As Britons, we have our own culture, our own society, our own language and our own lifestyle. This culture has been developed over centuries of wars, struggles, trials and victories fought by the untold masses of men and women who laid down their lives and one of the millions of men and women who have sought freedom.  We speak ENGLISH, not Spanish, Lebanese, Arabic, Chinese, Japanese, Russian, or any other language. Therefore, if you wish to become part of our society, learn the language! 'In God We Trust' is our National Motto.  This is not some Christian, right wing, political slogan. We adopted this motto because Christian men and women, on Christian principles, founded this nation, and this is clearly documented. It is certainly appropriate to display it on the walls of our schools.  If God offends you, then I suggest you consider another part of the world as your new home, because God is part of our culture. If St. George's cross offends you, or you don't like ' A Fair Go', then you should seriously consider a move to another part of this planet.   We are happy with our culture and have no desire to change, and we really don't care how you did things where you came from. This is OUR COUNTRY, OUR LAND, and OUR LIFESTYLE, and we will allow you every opportunity to enjoy all this.  But once you are done complaining, whining, and griping about Our Flag, Our Pledge, Our National Motto, or Our Way of Life, I highly encourage you take advantage of one other great British freedom, 'THE RIGHT TO LEAVE'.  We didn't force you to come here.  If you don't like it GO HOME!!  You asked to be here. So accept the country YOU accepted. Pretty easy really, when you think about it."
356060,BillM,2009-06-26 20:05:00,17367, Oh the irony... more religious banter...trying not be to seen as religious banter.
356061,Hellfish,2009-06-26 20:07:00,308,"well said i must say. I agree with it totally, not going to go into detail but why do they think they even have the right to complain to try and change OUR culture and OUR rights something WE have been fighting for 100 years, it really perplexes me."

356071,Cookslav,2009-06-26 20:21:00,1457," I'm Catholic...people generally hate me and I'm ok with that LOL! But in truth this statement says sooooo much.  How is it people of one faith are soooo offended by another faith simply practiceing their way of life in a country they have ALWAYs lived in? And how is it Practical to be offended for simply practiceing this age old tradition of faith in their home nation when its always been a tradition? It kills me... I do not deonouce other faiths, or even those who practice none.... But I find it such an oximorron when in principle most faiths at one level or another preach tolerance do they not? I guess its just in the back of the text in fine print right LOL!"
356075,singingdog,2009-06-26 20:27:00,1047," So, I assume you are eating bannock, wearing buckskins and typed this in English because your keyboard doesn't have all the Ojibway characters? Oh wait...you mean all the other cultures, not yours. Not interesting at all....just typical."
356076,pikehunter,2009-06-26 20:30:00,1659,"I received a very similiar email months ago from a friend, and yes this friend is a one time immigrant to Canada. So I was a little surprised to see that these are somewhat his views too.  Prime Minister Kevin Rudd - Australia  Muslims who want to live under Islamic Sharia law were told on Wednesday to get out of Australia , as the government targeted radicals in a bid to head off potential terror attacks..  Separately, Rudd angered some Australian Muslims on Wednesday by saying he supported spy agencies monitoring the nation's mosques. Quote: 'IMMIGRANTS, NOT AUSTRALIANS, MUST ADAPT. Take It Or Leave It. I am tired of this nation worrying about whether we are offending some individual or their culture. Since the terrorist attacks on Bali , we have experienced a surge in patriotism by the majority of Australians. '  'This culture has been developed over two centuries of struggles, trials and victories by millions of men and women who have sought freedom'  'We speak mainly ENGLISH, not Spanish, Lebanese, Arabic, Chinese, Japanese, Russian, or any other language. Therefore, if you wish to become part of our society . Learn the language!'  'Most Australians believe in God. This is not some Christian, right wing, political push, but a fact, because Christian men and women, on Christian principles, founded this nation, and this is clearly documented. It is certainly appropriate to display it on the walls of our schools. If God offends you, then I suggest you consider another part of the world as your new home, because God is part of our culture.'  'We will accept your beliefs, and will not question why. All we ask is that you accept ours, and live in harmony and peaceful enjoyment with us.'  'This is OUR COUNTRY, OUR LAND, and OUR LIFESTYLE, and we will allow you every opportunity to enjoy all this... But once you are done complaining, whining, and griping about Our Flag, Our Pledge, Our Christian beliefs, or Our Way of Life, I highly encourage you take advantage of one other great Australian freedom, 'THE RIGHT TO LEAVE'.'   'If you aren't happy here then LEAVE. We didn't force you to come here. You asked to be here. So accept the country YOU accepted.'   Maybe if we circulate this amongst ourselves, WE will find the courage to start speaking and voicing the same truths.  Funny thing, I have said the same for years. I don't hate, I don't dislike immigrants, and I don't discriminate even though I like minority based jokes even about my own background, if you can't laugh at yourself then you have no right to laugh at others faults.  I also have a Muslim fellow at work that agrees to the above.  Thanks for starting the thread Beans."

I can't help thinking of that old line ""Is that a gun in yer pocket, or are you just happy to see me?""  I suspect Beans' post was done in exactly the same vein as this one. It's giving us all a little laff. We know our wprld is rife with hypocrisy, and there's not much we can do but laff at some of it. Given all the do-gooder bleeding heart types around we sure ain't gonna fix it any time soon.

356156,blarg,2009-06-27 00:04:00,289,"I agree with the op 100%.  And yea aboriginals were here before us and this matters why?  I could explain how all over the world thoughout recorded history and before people fought over and took land from each other, there is plenty of evidence to suggest that the aboriginals now took the land from other aboriginals, who is going to compensate those people, oh wait, they were most certainly all killed, I could point out that we took this land as fairly as anyone else ever took land from anyone else, it's the way of the world. But whats the point, you can't speak logically to a socialist.  But now, this is our land, and while maybe sometime in the future someone will take it from us, for now it's ours, and there is no requirement for us to give it away to any group, while it's ours we make the rules, and what could be wrong with that.  Are we too nice for that? does it hurt some peoples feelings? aww thats just too bad."
356160,Radnine,2009-06-27 00:49:00,1538," Every time I read one of these rant threads I cringe. The one above is particularly sad. I just can't figure out why people can't be happy with who they are and not worry so much about everyone else. What makes someone think ""the country would be a lot better if everyone was white and just like me. Or if they couldn't be white, why can't they at least act white"" 'Cause that's what these types of rants are saying. You may use the word ""Canadian"" but you mean white, like you. I don't know Bean's from, well, beans and if this was a wind up (as JohnF suggests) it was a good one. But the subject (in various forms, earlier this week it was the ""two black guys and the teenage girl"" like their colour was actually pertinent to the so called story) comes up far too often here. I realize that I might be painting with a pretty wide brush here, and don't really want to make judgements on a group of people unjustly, since that is really what I think is the problem with all of these ""immigrant"" type threads. But they get locked down every time and there is always a good reason. I can hardly wait for the time when they don't get started in the first place. I promised myself a while ago that I would not dwell on what I consider to be the dark side of the board, so I am not going to read this post anymore (so take your best shots). Jim"
