We still spent some decent time on the water, and caught a few eating-size pike. We didn't waste much time in getting them into the fryer:   With morning mist, calm water and a quickly-downed breakfast on Sunday, I was good to go. This is what it looked like from the dock:   A bowfin tends to her young in the shallows by the dock:    The weather turned out to be almost too good. We caught a 4 or 5 weed rockets and a couple of more respectable pike, but I decided if the bite wasn't really happening, then I would go big. I broke out my heavy gear and started throwing a big black Bucher Spinner bait with a Berkley gulp perch on the trailer hook. Then this guy came along:     And that made my day! I've never thought of myself as a walleye fisherman, and don't generally go after them, especially where we were, because they're very seldom caught. We were fishing an area that is fairly shallow; the strike came in somewhat deeper water, adjacent to the weed beds. Coming up, I thought he was maybe a muskie, knew he wasn't a pike, and was pretty surprised when I saw the dorsal fin. At 31 inches, that's my best 'eye ever. A couple more photos, and back in the water he went. A great way to wind up the weekend! Backbay"

355973,ciceri,2009-06-26 15:52:00,535,"Wow, that is a nice Walleye, they are pretty hard to come by on Southern Georgian Bay, if thats where you were."
355976,backbay,2009-06-26 15:58:00,773,"You're right on both counts, Ciceri! I was pretty surprised to catch it, especially on the big spinnerbait, but really felt great knowing they're around."
355977,ciceri,2009-06-26 16:06:00,535," Yeah, Georgian Bay is a great lake to fish, has every fish there is. I still haven't caught my first walleye or musky out there yet though.  Nice picture, I hope to be out there tomorrow looking for some big Smallies!"
