Example, their 230 series reels are about the size of a regular 2500 size, but will hold 300m of 15lb. PowerPro, weighs 9oz., made out of carbon fibre and apparently cast further than anything else!  Only con is that they're not cheap (but not stupid expensive), and made in China so longevity is probably on par with Shimano's  Anybody tried these guys?  http://www.usreel.com/products/SpinningFeatures.aspx"
356232,dave524,2009-06-27 19:17:00,4508,"I like the idea of the large diameter spool , there is really no advantage to a small diameter spool other than size and weight , everything else about a small spool takes away from the performance of a spinning reel. I would look at one for steelheading and shore casting for trout .  The 180 SX with 170yds of 8lb. test @ 7.3 oz. SWEET thats the weight of my old 308 Mitchell."
356261,salmon,2009-06-27 22:02:00,334, Cabela's has some of them on sale now.  Long link to it. Great for the salmon pier guys.  http://www.cabelas.com/cabelas/en/template...&hasJS=true
356271,Garry2Rs,2009-06-27 22:41:00,1425,I remember reading the spec's and thinking there were a lot of carbon parts for the price... Anyway you probably wouldn't like it...it was made for Bass fishing...HAHAHA
356321,Cudz,2009-06-28 03:34:00,2652,I have used them.  They have a smooth drag and the amount of twist seems to be reduced.
