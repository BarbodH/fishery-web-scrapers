Total Hours on the Water - 15  Total Pike - 17  Best Day - 10 fish landed  Largest - 25"" X 2  Smallest - 14""  Once again, was not able to catch a fish larger than 25"". Three years in a row with the largest being that exact size. The section of the lake I fish has no deep water so that may play a factor as all the pickerel are in a different area of the lake.  I have one more trip booked in August in the same area but next year I will be going to a different lodge on the lake where there is deeper channels mixed with shallow structure.  Note that almost all pics were self timed and done alone as I was fishing by myself for the most part. My wife Anna did come out once with me to take a couple shots.  All fish released!       This is one of the longest ones I caught. Trying to self time the photo, in high winds, approaching a shoal, with bright sun, with the dog in the boat, was too tuff a task.          Couldn't pass up some swimming being that the temp was 32 feels like 37     Crazy sunset to finish the trip off in style!       Bass report coming up next by the end of next week!!!"

356166,msp,2009-06-27 01:29:00,1336,Nice goin on the pike. Great lookin Weimaraner. I have two of the neurotic buggers at home. They seem to like steelheading with me on the river. They also love eating roe bags and dead salmon. Makes for great breath.
356202,laszlo,2009-06-27 12:07:00,487,i also take my weimeraner (IDA) wading in the river with me. she can't get enough of the water and even catches the odd cat fish that's been partially stunned by a heron.  i do have to leash her around my waste though because her fetch instinct is way too strong when she see's me cast.  great dogs as long as you give them that 45 minutes of leash free play 5-7 days a week. as for me running and biking does the trick well.     ida scanning for cat fish.       after being outside swimming all day.
