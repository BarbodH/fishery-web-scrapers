If my wife says I am NOT listening to her and that I am somewhere else this week?  If the van is gassed up, oil checked and air is in the tires?  If I wish i could afford a boat to get to a few places I ""know"" are holding some lunkers?  If my daughter is is telling mommy that daddy will be ok after he comes home with some bass?  If i jump when the cell phone rings, in anticipation of my buddy agreeing to an all nighter tonight?  If I keep checking the weather station "" to make sure' all is good in that area?  If I keep checking this damned board to see if I am the only one just about out of his mind in anticipation for the opener?   If all of this is happening in my ""addhd"" brain of mine... does it mean I have to go to some 12 step group for fishermen?  Please help me...  I called the fishermens anonymous hotline... and they asked me to ""hold"".. I started looking for my rod!  lol"

Rowing out in near silence to your starting point with only the odd creak of your oar rubbing the gunnel to disturb the tranquility and keep you grounded in reality. As you prepare for that first cast, you survey the surroundings and tie on on your choice of weapon. All the while sipping on a steaming hot mug of half and half while you take in the beauty of it all.  And then,     it begins."
