However the cottage itself doesn't have a boat launch so I'm hoping if someone can point me in the right direction. Free/public launch would be nice, if not, at least reasonably priced I guess, I did a search on here and saw some that's over $20 near the HH area ...  O btw, i'm pulling with a nissan pathfinder and it's a 14' tinny, so we should be able to get in/out of any launch without too much problem.  Thanks and have a safe+fish-ful opener,  Victor"
356021,BillM,2009-06-26 18:24:00,17367,Apparently you can put the boat in across from the post office in HH.  Just down the road I've heard rumors of some guy letting you park on his lawn for $10 or so.
356045,bigbuck,2009-06-26 19:39:00,2449,"Across from the Post office, uh-uh!! No way, there is  an old unmaintained boat launch that I would not even think about. I'd give Village Marine a call and see how much they want, it's about a mile or 2 from South Bay and the guys there are great, it's a good concrete launch and you don't need to worry about damage from bad launches. Pull out from there and hang a right when you get to the main channel and you'll be in South Bay in no time. If you see me, say hi, I'll be fishing out of a 19ft Larson Fish 'n ski with a green top. Good fishing!!"

356302,mikeh,2009-06-28 01:59:00,824,"I have no idea where to launch, but try some of the back bays for crappie they may still be there. Use a slip float and one inch tube or small jig.good luck."
