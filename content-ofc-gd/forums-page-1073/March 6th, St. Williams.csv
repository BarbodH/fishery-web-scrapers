Fishlips managed to haul in a lot of big fish today, outfishing both lefty and I using a small buckshot and a Big N Float...  We were fishing out of St. Williams, about 107 fish caught between the three of us, what a day.  A special thank you to Propers Fish Huts for helping us get on the fish today...  Get out there while the bite is on!  A reminder to carry your licences, insurance and ownerships, wear your helmets if running out on sleds or quauds.  Ministry was there checking everyone that came in ... Watch your limits, it's 50 perch per person...  Ice was 12"" to 13"" in close and varies out by EC-10 from 12"" to 6"" in some spots. Water was clear in some spots and not in others.    "
