166433,beertech,2008-03-02 00:59:00,118,I agree i stopped in there on friday didn;t buy a thing. Stuff was either overpriced even on sale or just closeout junk colours ect that is outdated.  For example stopped by grimsby tackle today and picked up a quantum energy baitcaster for 99 bucks basspros sale is 137.99 that easy math. Oh and by the way their sportsman show price is going to be 99 no taxes.
166504,BFSC Kevin,2008-03-02 05:31:00,1351,lunch? how about a fishing trip?? eh G? lol  kevin
166591,bramptonjerry,2008-03-02 16:25:00,132,"the gift card is gone....it's not tied into your name at all....the couple in front of me yesterday, husband smiling and wife really ticked she says ""what do you think this is Christmas?""...he just kept his head down and mouth shut but kept on smiling!"
166639,Mike the Pike,2008-03-02 17:36:00,3421,Its a good thing we don't have a BPS here in Montreal or I would be in trouble.  The wife can't believe what my new boat costs so spending even more is not good.  This is all I spent in October at BPS $120.00    We are supposed to be getting a Cabelas here in Quebec .There goes the bank account
166688,SlowPoke,2008-03-02 20:49:00,2984,"I can see it now.... (translated loosely) ""Salut le miel, je suis à la maison. J'ai posé un nouveau compte aujourd'hui et je devrai probablement aller là deux ou trois fois par semaine."""

166890,LundGuy,2008-03-03 07:26:00,169,"Hi guys, I am new to this site. I live in the London area and I usually visit BPS at least 5-6 times a year. I stop in on my way by heading up north to my camp.I pick up the odd thing,mostly clothing,blue jeans are usually less expensive there.As far as electronics,electric motors and fishing gear, there is no one better or cheaper to buy from than Angling Outfitters who are located on HWY#2 just west of Woodstock(They just relocated). I have bought from just about everywhere,but these guys are the cheapest by far. They also take trade ins.The owner Joslyn knows his stuff,especially electronics. The place is always busy.Since finding this place I just visit BPS for something to do now."
166919,Gerritt,2008-03-03 13:20:00,6129,"Welcome aboard LundGuy!  I also shop @ Angling Outfitters. I was directed there when I was buying all the new electronics for my boat and your right, He has great pricing! and if he is higher in price he will lower it even against Cabelas!  There is a reason he is the #1 Lowrance dealer in Canada He has the best price and man can Jos push buttons on those units.  I was just in there a couple days ago... sadly he did not have in my '08 Navionics.  G"
167067,LundGuy,2008-03-03 19:19:00,169,"Nice to meet ya. I was also there a couple days ago and picked up two Minn Kota  Terrova electric motors. He blew everyone out of the water on the prices.Also picked up a new Stella 1000FA reel and again nobody could touch his price, including eBay.  PS: .....I agree,when he gets pushing those buttons on the electronics its all I can do to keep up."
167085,Gerritt,2008-03-03 20:36:00,6129,"  After meeting him... let me tell you what a rarity he is... (I am sure you know this already) I drive there from Hamilton.. not only for the price but the service... I have to thank the OFC'r that took me there (Rod) as this guy (Jos) is truly a rarity here in the Hammer we have 2 main choices... Fishing world and Bills Bait N Tackle... Well I give the boys @ Bill Bait all the business I can... however they just dont have everything, although the service is Phenomenal! and the other place... well everyone knows my feelings...  Having said that... Jos knows his electronics.. he may be a bit different... but he knows his stuff!!!! and his customer service is at par if not better then Bills N Tackle...  Sure I will spend a few bucks across the board.... and maybe I went excessive @ BPS.... but these two companies NOW see the majority of my fishing dollars (and I spend alot! lol)  Gerritt."
168582,BFSC Kevin,2008-03-07 21:28:00,1351,"lol... second round yesterday....i already held back a bit.. dang,..  "
168712,BillM,2008-03-08 02:32:00,17367,"Dropped off at BPS today and picked up some stuff.  To bad they were out of the Bluefox muskie buzzbait I was after (go figure).  I did however pick up some nice plastics..  I asked a guy in a pro shirt a question about a swimbait I was looking at, and he walked me around the plastics and showed me exactly what I needed to match up what was already in my basket.  Real nice guy, didn't seem to mind my newbie questions (I'm not much of a plastics guy, I rarely jig, but am making a point of jigging this year for smallmouth and pickeral)"
168727,tdotfisherman,2008-03-08 03:26:00,317,"I was there today, first time at the sale.. picked up an Abu C4 5600, 2 Rapala's, jigs, plastics, and a few other odds and ends.. Thank God I'm broke or I would have spent hundreds of dollars more.."
165952,Gerritt,2008-02-29 15:56:00,6129,"Because I blew 600.00 in 10 minutes!  Bought a sound system for the boat... now TJ and I can have SPL contests on the lake...  Picked up the New Stradic 2500 FI Picked up a new St. Croix Premier 7'6"" and a new Net....  Now to get the boring stuff like a new anchor etc...  It was busy in there! man people everywhere!  Kevin I look for you but did not see you... even asked a guy that kinda looked like you if he was Kevin... I looked like a fool LOL!  G"
165954,grt1,2008-02-29 15:59:00,638,"Be thankful you can get to BPS. I'm planning to go to Cabelas in April and it's a 2 day drive.  JUst got the old plastic card down and now it's going to take another licking,   damn I hate that!"
165955,Douger,2008-02-29 16:05:00,116,I often wonder how many of the regulars at BPS are divorced
165958,cthewrld,2008-02-29 16:25:00,99,"I'm with Gerritt.  I was there for around an hour, and blew $600. as well.  Drift socks. new PDF, new line etc.  The place was packed, but was running efficiently.  The sales are good.  Can't imagine what the place will be like on the weekend!"
165960,irishfield,2008-02-29 16:35:00,26272,"I skipped the drive... casually browsed ebay and, for a change, bought nothing! (today ! YET   )"
166014,lazybum,2008-02-29 18:16:00,142," Hey Gerritt, that was none other than our carp fanatic MJL that you asked.  We were busy chatting away   with another fella and didn't clue in that it was you.  Sorry about that.  And no don't feel bad, you didn't look like a fool."
166017,OhioFisherman,2008-02-29 18:25:00,6623,Cha-ching!   600 in 10 minutes? you won`t have to spend as much next year?
166023,Photoz,2008-02-29 18:53:00,792,"Geeze, when I saw your title ""Back from BPS...., Man I hate that store"" I was just gonna recommend 'Fishing World."
166027,Gerritt,2008-02-29 19:06:00,6129,  HAHAHHAHAAA!!
166064,Gerritt,2008-02-29 22:14:00,6129,   Awww man! I thought he looked familiar.. but after asking if he was Kevin... there was no way I was coming back to ask if he was an OFC'r! lol... Would have loved to have chatted you guys up!  G
166149,Markystang,2008-03-01 02:52:00,131,$600! Damn! Thanks guys! Now I don't feel so bad for dropping $300 on a bunch of stuff I really don't need....
166154,wallyboss,2008-03-01 03:01:00,1095,I did the same today in 15 minutes but just because that's all the time I had in there(Thank God) I had a business meeting that finished a tad early so I took a taxi there got there at 150:pm and I was walking out at 2:15 pm cause I had to be at Pearson airport for 3:00pm. But if I would've known my flight was delayed by about 1 hour then we spent another hour on the tarmac before taking off. spent 15 minutes in the store but then I had to get to the Airport. Man I could've spent 3 times the amount I spent.
166156,tbayboy,2008-03-01 03:06:00,1497,Here's my crazy spending logic - since the drive home from the office is going to be miserable i might as well just drive right to BPS so at least at the end of the miserable drive I'd be at a wonderful spot .  Luckily I managed to get out without any really big ticket items but still put together a decent pile    Of course then I get home to find the spring Cabelas catalog in the mail box...
166164,SlowPoke,2008-03-01 03:24:00,2984, If you went in with a plan you could have been out in 5 minutes but at least you had a chance to browse and almost meet some OFC'ers! -Brian
166167,Tarzan's Jane,2008-03-01 03:28:00,1183,what did ya get the missus....ah never mind....she's probably going shopping tomorrow right.  lol
166171,BFSC Kevin,2008-03-01 03:36:00,1351,"ahh.. sorry Gerrit, missed you.. i got there around 10:30.. well here is my damage.. i don't know if i need 4 combos.. might return two of them.. or could keep them.. lol..  "
166172,ccmtcanada,2008-03-01 03:37:00,7971,Gerritt...dont feel bad about the Kevin/MJL thing....us Asians all look alike....  Just like all you white people look the same to us.....LOL
166176,BFSC Kevin,2008-03-01 03:40:00,1351, LOL
166202,Gerritt,2008-03-01 05:02:00,6129,"  LOL race never entered my mind, you should know me better than that Cliff!... but now that you mention it.... LOL!  I saw MLJ and thought to myself HEY! this guy looks familiar!  I was expecting to see Kevin there... and well... from little avatars. they look the same, hell Kimbo Slice and I look the same if we look at avatars alone...... I remembered one thing after asking though.. MLJ wears glasses! DOH! (hind sight is 20/20)  anyways.. I spent way to much, on thing I did not need... but wanted...   Does anyone else have the new Stradic 2500 FI?  I also have to that the boyz from Extreme Angler for the St.Croix rod they donated @ the Tyler event.. because I picked up another one.... just because I liked the feel of it! but this one is a 7'6"" one peice...  anyways Kevin, we have to do lunch one day... and well we might as well invite Cliff too....  say between Vaughan (where I work) and downtown (Where Cliff works)  ??  I am game for anything.... so long as it has meat in it.  G."
166207,Carp,2008-03-01 06:01:00,1488,"I don't feel so bad now. Passed by around 8pm for a bit. I don't know when they started charging for browsing? 20 minutes of looking at stuff I didn't really need cost me $220.  Also looks like someone scooped a BPS gift card and my credit card at the cash. Had 'em in my hand, put everything on the counter for the cashier, then couldn't find the cards. Guy ahead of me seemed in a bit of a rush to leave. HMMM ??? Don't they have cameras in that store? I should call or pass by after they open in the morning and ask. Credit card has been taken care of, but the gift card could be lost. Can't remember if they ask for ID with the gift card?  See Wayne, I'm multi-talented. I can lose more than just boat keys. Credit card & gift card at the same time. Now that's talent."
166214,Marc Thorpe,2008-03-01 09:50:00,621,"I see my favorite flavor "" Blueberry Muffin"" Bring on the reef runner season"
166233,cranks bait,2008-03-01 13:26:00,721,"Torture, absolute torture.  I am going through withdrawl here and all you guys can do is talk about all these deals and show pictures.  You're all cruel, the whole bunch of ya's!  Reef Runners are one of my best producing lures and seeing those deals really hurt.  Guess I'll settle and go to CTC in Kingston.  However I did luck out last Sunday and manage to get into Lebaron in Ottawa.  Guessing they were open because of the show and family free fishing weekend?  I wasn't going to get much because the last time I was in there I got really peved.  Just a look around, never hurts to look.  I grabbed a couple of muskie lures out of the sale bin for less than $3.00.  Then my wife came in and had mentioned that it was also a no tax day.  Oh crap the pressure mounted.  Needless to say I ended up $350.00 poorer.  Gerritt I looked at the Stratic 2500 FI.  I got the FH model last year and really like it.  I opted to go with the Saros instead it was about $60.00 cheaper and seemed to be very similar.  All I can say is it took to line really well.  All it's doing right now is sitting in the corner waiting to get used and abused."
166285,fishindevil,2008-03-01 17:59:00,6254,"Well thanks for the update gerritt,so at least i know what im up against tommorow morning,although last year i went right when it opened and got what i needed on my list and was out of there in less than 1 hour!!!!!....i think thats the key to avoid,having a stroke,or heart attack !!!! LOL..LOL i have a list already made,so hopefully it will be the same....cheers"
166385,Corey,2008-03-01 22:47:00,355,That's a lot of money in 10 minutes... Timed shopping spree?
166426,fishing n autograph,2008-03-02 00:36:00,2540,I have to say I wasn't too impressed with BPS. The deals weren't that good......i figured that with their size they could give us better prices so next time i'll save the gas and go to a local shop...or shop online
