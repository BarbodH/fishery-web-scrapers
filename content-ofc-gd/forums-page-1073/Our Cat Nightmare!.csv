Hes a good cat, just loves to scratch and play (typical kitten)  Dropped him off at 8am this morning and was to pick him up anytime after 3.  I show up and this woman takes me in a room and says their has been some complications. Apparently our cat is allergic to the anesthetic, his heart stopped at the end of the surgery and they had to revive him.  Well he's now temporarily blind, they arent sure if he has any long term damage. He is responsive when they touch  the inside of his eye, he was up walking around but Iam extremely concerned.  Andrea had just put her cat down after 7 years when she moved out here, the poor thing had a tumor in her stomach.  This is turning into a disaster, the cat was extremely sick when we purchased him....infact he almost died the first week we had him...we thought we were in the clear and now this happens!  Has anyone heard of this happening before?  His names Tucker. "

168719,BillM,2008-03-08 02:53:00,17367,Ah man that's awful!!!  Hopefully the blindness is due to swelling and that will get better after time...  My 2 kittens go in Monday morning for spay/neuter along with declawing..  They'll be there 3 nights..

168730,blizzcat,2008-03-08 03:31:00,92,"aww  geez i'm sorry. i lost my two kitties the last couple years and i was just heartbroken. i googled it and there are other cases similar to yours, some have regained vision and others lost it forever.. I really hope your cat gets better!"
168734,crappieperchhunter,2008-03-08 03:40:00,2582,"Jeez Kyle sorry to hear about Tucker's bad luck. I'm rooting for things to work out. Those little bugger's look all soft and cuddly....but they are pretty darn tough too!  All the best, Steve"
168735,ccmtcanada,2008-03-08 03:41:00,7971,Wow...very sorry to hear this news!  I hope your little kitty fully recovers!!
168742,shane,2008-03-08 04:01:00,652,Always sad to hear about pets having hard times.  Best wishes to your little guy.
168748,ChrisK,2008-03-08 04:33:00,2772,"Kyle, Sorry to here about your kittens unfortunate visit to the vet. I'm shure he'll be fine one way or the other...  Cheers !!!"
168871,Cookslav,2008-03-08 16:15:00,1457,"Geeze.... Thats ruff for sure.  Did they offer to do a pre-opp blood work test? Just curious, as our Vet tests for this situation....its appearently common So we paid this fee for all our pets, so its on file with their office The blood work is generaly $70-$100 so.... Unfortunatly many Vets skip this step and don't even ask the ownner being some people veiw it as exsessive.  I've not known any one who had it happen to their cats, although I do know a PERSON who its happened to. They were fine after the fact, but it was scarey for sure. The Reaction caused swelling that cause pressure on the optic nerve...I'm no doctor but thats the explanation I remember? Once the swelling went down the sight returned, and now they were a pretty little braclet(medic alert)  My wife is also Alergic to it... We found out the hard way, when she had her wisdom teeth taken out. She wouldn't wake up...had to keep her on the oxygen, but it could have been worse  I agree with Crappie.... They are cute and cuddly but they can be pretty resiliant.  Sounds like your little furball has used atleast 2 of 9 lives"
168873,TJQ,2008-03-08 16:32:00,7806,Thats tough... at one time we had 5 cats... down to two now... circle of life stuff....  I hope the kitty recovers for you.
168875,nelly,2008-03-08 16:35:00,256,Sorry to hear about your cat and hope things will turn out for the better.
168894,blaque,2008-03-08 17:14:00,2419,<Prayers going out for the little one>
