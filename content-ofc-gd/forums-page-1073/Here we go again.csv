Esso stations in Calgary have begun to run out.  The Radio station petroleum supposed expert, says that Esso is keeping whatever the problem is a secret.  Here we go with price increases AGAIN.  Hallelujah"
168583,aniceguy,2008-03-07 21:31:00,1094,gotta love when its a secret yet we need to pay
168588,urbanangler1990,2008-03-07 21:59:00,933,"easy ways to deal with it, GO TRANSIT, TTC"
168593,Cory,2008-03-07 22:13:00,170,"They just leaked the secret to me....              March Break....  Shhh, don't tell anyone else."
168595,ccmtcanada,2008-03-07 22:18:00,7971," GO transit?  You're kidding right? LOL.  You are right though UA...there are alternatives.  I usually take the GO when there is bad weather, and the on time rate plummets to around 50% during rush hour...If you have a flexible manager who doesn't mind you being late, then all the better.  The problem is that it's more expensive for me to take the GO and TTC than it is to drive, even when you consider the price of gas, parking and wear and tear on my vehicle.  Also, in good weather, it takes me longer to take public transportation."
168598,Terry,2008-03-07 22:21:00,14456,do you think go or ttc would swing by my home and take me up to willow beach for some fishing
168601,urbanangler1990,2008-03-07 22:24:00,933,"CCTM, longer perhaps, but isnt it cheapier in the long run to take GO and TTC?"
168602,urbanangler1990,2008-03-07 22:24:00,933, sorry i was referring to the METROPOLIANS
