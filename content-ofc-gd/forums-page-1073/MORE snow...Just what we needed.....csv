168138,ccmtcanada,2008-03-06 13:23:00,7971,"The ONLY good thing about all this snow this winter, is that hopefully water levels in the tribs and other shore fishing spots will improve to the point where fishing can actually happen in the spring!  Then again, if you've read the article the Spiel posted about Lake Simcoe in the news section, this could add to an already potential disastrous situation.  I've attached the latest weather statement, but there are no snowfall totals in there.  Accuweather.com is saying the potential from London to Toronto (as well as Eastern Ontario and Southern Quebec) is 30+cm of snow.

168262,ccmtcanada,2008-03-06 20:23:00,7971,Update from Environment Canada.....  City of Toronto 2:43 PM EST Thursday 6 March 2008 Winter storm watch for City of Toronto issued  ..Another winter Wallop threatens spring forward weekend..  This is an alert to the potential development of dangerous winter weather conditions in these regions. Monitor weather conditions..Listen for updated statements.    A winter storm is currently brewing over Texas with the potential to bring significant snow to most of southern Ontario. It appears that the snow will come in two doses. The first shot will begin as early as Friday afternoon for southwestern Ontario and Friday evening in eastern Ontario. We may have a brief reprieve overnight into Saturday morning where snow may become light and more intermittent. The heaviest snowfall is then expected in the second shot beginning later Saturday. Keep in mind that this storm is expected to last for 36 to 48 hours.  Storm totals may be near 30 centimetres along and east of a line from Long Point to the Golden Horseshoe then to Petawawa. There is potential for 30 to 50 centimetres of snow over the Niagara Peninsula and parts of eastern Ontario. Areas west of the Long Point to Petawawa line should see between 10 to 20 centimetres with lesser amounts near Lake Huron and Georgian Bay. Behind this system we could see strong northerly winds to 60 km/h. On Saturday strong winds combined with fresh snow will cause blowing snow to lower visibilities and create dangerous driving conditions. Whiteout conditions are possible so travellers should be prepared to alter their plans accordingly.  Total snowfall amounts will depend on the track of this system. There is still some uncertainty as to the exact track of this storm. Environment Canada will closely monitor this situation and issue warnings as required within the next 24 hours.   Yep...I read that right.....30 to 50cm!!!!
168263,Raf,2008-03-06 20:24:00,3495,see hunny it was a good idea getting that 4x4..  the roads will be mine again this wknd!
168268,Guest gbfisher,2008-03-06 20:36:00,0,"  You and me both........ Makes for a shorter spring. I hope the ice doesn't come off the lake until last week in April.  Be another good opener again this year.    Good Syrup too!! We still have the best ice fishing yet to come. The snow will melt....the sun will stay out longer....only means for a longer day out on the ice. It's Canada gentlemen, may as well enjoy what comes your way.  "
168272,Rich Clemens,2008-03-06 20:50:00,3131,Been hearing about this and the latest for where I am is that the worst of this is to pass to the North and West.  Snow pretty well gone now around my parts ... except that which had been completely frozen.  Spring is just a couple weeks away.
