167202,mepps,2008-03-04 02:00:00,1301,great report! nice to see those spinner baits catch fish - theres nothing better for pike if you ask me!
167205,lovetofish,2008-03-04 02:14:00,500,"Wow! great report, thanks for taking the time!!!   lovetofish"
167219,gekhunter,2008-03-04 03:10:00,61,"great report with vids and pics, thanks for taking the time to share.  You are lucky to have that experience up there.    Greg"
167225,Weeds,2008-03-04 03:19:00,782,Awesome report. You have my dream job.
167227,trapshooter,2008-03-04 03:39:00,1234,"Wow Dave!!  I've been away from the computer for a few days and just found your report now.  Epic!!  Thanks for taking the time to get all those photo's up and recount your season.  There were a lot of points I could relate to and it made me laugh thinking about how us guides aren't that different from lodge to lodge.  Bears in camp, bad weather, sleeping in past breakfast, good guests, bad guests, gread fishing, tough fishing, broken boats, making due with what you've got.  I'm going to have to move someone's bedroom out on the lawn this year too.  Funny stuff.  I remember Ryan D talking about Gary Lee!!  That's amazing.  I don't know about you but I'm already thinking about the coming season.  Only a couple months now.  You convinced me to keep a journal this year as well.  Thanks again for such a great read."
167243,sharper,2008-03-04 04:28:00,279,"I read it over 2 days, but an amazing report! I wish I could fish up there."
167247,Rob,2008-03-04 04:42:00,467,Well that read was something else! I am sure one day we'll be reading your reports in a fishing magazine. Great pictures and video to boot!   Well done and hope to see more in the future.  Rob C
167255,Mike the Pike,2008-03-04 05:24:00,3421,Absolutely fullfilling report young man.Wow and Wow.  Man that took hours to prepare and it is very much appreciated I really enjoyed the videos of the Pike snackin on the minnows.  Looking forward to the next report  MTP
167617,Ramble,2008-03-05 01:32:00,713,Thanks again for all teh comments guys. I enjoy reading them.
167620,nelly,2008-03-05 01:38:00,256,"This has to be the longest report that I have read from the board. I don't know how much time I spent but it was well worth it and interesting. I really felt I was there, great job on the pics and report."
167720,scuro,2008-03-05 05:30:00,386,"I simply loved the staff. We actually didn't talk to Dave much but whenever we asked something he helped us out with a friendly smile. All the staff were like that, Sweetpea was about as friendly as you can get. Nice seeing the pictures of the staff again. Yup, Dave totally saved our donkey. Out 10 k down the lake and we haven't seen a soul all day. The motor is dead and I mean useless and we are being blown/rocked against the scrub shore with 1 ft waves. It's 10 degrees..windy and there is drizzle...and me still hungover. I'm doing a calculation of the soonest they get us by....9pm...perhaps they would not come down so far because who in their right mind would go so far on such a crappy day...and then Dave comes around a point and we are waving everything like frantic lunatics...and rescue.  We are thinking of going back this summer. It certainly is a trip that me and my wife will never forget. Karma dictates that Dave will guide us on our first day back."
167721,Ramble,2008-03-05 05:44:00,713,"If you come back, book me when yoiu make you reservations and make sure charlie writes it down.  -Dave"
167817,Kirk,2008-03-05 16:00:00,347,"Kesagami's on my short list for a group trip.  I haven't finished reading your report but from what I've seen so far, it has the makings of a great book.  Good job."
167971,BLACKFISH88,2008-03-06 00:27:00,191,Great report thanks for taking the time enjoyed it thorougly!
168235,goteeboy,2008-03-06 18:05:00,175,great report. it's my brother's and my dream to make it up there one of these days.
168395,hillbilly,2008-03-07 06:42:00,14,"awesome report pal  BEST PRANK EVER on robs part, but i do hafta say even tho the report was brilliant. if you spent more time studying and less time writing novels you would be able to go fishin with me this weekend   ass hat.  you need to git your    down here so we can hit some more hard water b4 it's viagra runs out.  gone fishin....."
168684,GregF2,2008-03-08 01:25:00,46,Hi Dave - great report!!!  You always make our experience a fun one at Kesagami.  Hopefully we will have the honor of you guiding us this year too.  Greg Fish
168721,Ramble,2008-03-08 02:57:00,713,GREG!!! Good to hear from you. Maybe i'll end up guiding you guys again this year. Do you guys have a copy of the photo from my 1st year with you guys when i fell out of the boat?  -Dave
166565,Moosebunk,2008-03-02 14:45:00,3970,"Dave, Dave, Dave... you can surely make life harder to live with a soft water report like that which comes in the winter.  I think I'll surely miss going there this summer, but hey... I'll be getting that ride on Hearst Air's twin otter instead.  Will keep an eye out for the gnats.  I think you did quite well during what I felt ended up being a difficult weather summer up here.  It's great you keep the journal because when you mentioned some dates, how you did and what the weather was like I was able to look back into my own notes and see how I did fishing just 90 miles away.  One thing as a newcomer that last year Float and I had not enough time to really concentrate (find) on were mid lake shoals.  Not wanting anything to do really with walleye (in more suitable walleye weather) we kept after the pike.  I love that lake man.  Fishing northerns in shallow waters is the best way to fish-em.  Float and I had some bad luck with the big fish.  Losing a mid 40 on the west side first day while on a troll is etched in my mind as one of my biggest ""one that got away"" memories.  Told Charlie when I was there how I'd had thought I'd like to guide... 2009 when I likely quit the north to move south that summer.  I couldn't start as deckhand or anything else.  If I wasn't in the boat everyday I'd slit my wrists.  I wonder if Charlie would let me work there for free (just meals and room) if I could guide and fish everyday???  I'd seriously do it.  We'll reschedule the fly-fishing lessons too.  Keep working there as long as you can Dave.  I'm going to stop in and say hi to Rob this week, I'll pass along the link for him.  He'll love the bedroom pic and I think all of the report.  You and the crew there were a great bunch... and man, I don't know how you couldn't get yourself into some fun with some of the housekeeping and other staff. lol  Now that you've done this big report; which I'll be reading again because I enjoyed it top to bottom, what are you going to do next time???  People will be waiting man.    I'll be expecting 2008's Kesagami report to not come like 7 months after the fact.  I knew you'd do it well...  You remind me of my best friend in highschool who was a real quick-witted jokester, to be that kind of person requires intelligence.  To have both can easily create talent.  You find time before or after your trip this way next year stop in and see Rob and I in the Moose.  The fishing ain't as good but you'll have another story to tell I'd bet.  And, buy some better waterproof fishing gloves, or keep a few pairs.  If you were my guide there'd be no wimping out on the shorelunch over cold thumbs.   j/k"
166567,mattyk,2008-03-02 14:46:00,2110,simply an amazing report!
166595,irishfield,2008-03-02 16:32:00,26272,"I browsed it quick and then decided to grab breakfast to sit down and read it. THANKS Ramble... I'll be sure to look for your kidney next time I""m in Cochrane!  What a fantastic read !!! And as for the second picture... been there done that... learned a thing or two! LOL"
166599,lew,2008-03-02 16:47:00,12767," Your right Ramble, that probably IS the longest report ever on this board, but it was also one of the BEST  Thanks for taking the time  !!"
166625,Radnine,2008-03-02 17:22:00,1538,"Wow. And I mean wow. I am sitting here feeling the way you do when you finish a good book, and you just sit quietly digesting what you just took in. I’m spent is what I am. I don’t know what you do for a living when you’re not guiding, but you could write resort reviews or create websites, or what ever you please. The way the season climaxes with the epic pike in the weeds and under the boat battle is nothing short of literary genius. Throw in the odd sexual dalliance and you’ve got a movie script. Can you tell I liked it? Wow man!"
166630,Casey123,2008-03-02 17:25:00,461,"Awesome report, thanks for sharing."

166887,highdrifter,2008-03-03 05:46:00,2534,Ahhhh  yyeeeeaahh...  Awesome report..  The pictures and narrative are right on.  Incredible scenery shots too!  I've had the opportunity to guide northern waters and it was unforgettable.  What a priviledge it was.  I'm very satisfied.  Thanks for that!  cheers HD
166902,solopaddler,2008-03-03 11:34:00,8605,"Well done! That was quite possibly the longest internet report I've read, LOL!, and one of the best! As a former guide at Kesagami there was much I can relate to... Curious on a couple of points, what's the new ownership like to work for compared to Bob and Marsha?, and does Darcy Lee still work there? (he was a good man).  Cheers!"
166916,Moosebunk,2008-03-03 13:06:00,3970,Crikey Dave.... your report is still on fire.  Burn baby burn. Haha
166971,Ramble,2008-03-03 15:59:00,713,"Thanks for all the comments everyone. I wrote it with hopes it would be enjoyed, and I was quite concerned about the length. You wouldn't believe some of the stuff i left out!! Your comments make the reports worth writting.  Solo...i much prefer the new owners, rules are less strick and Charlie is more relaxed. No Darcy doesn't still work their, but Gary still does!!! He lost a tooth this year in the boat. He tried to tell us he was hit in the mouth with a lure, but he was actually eating licorice lololol He's still doing the bear hunting stuff, and pulled boats with us. We gave him a few nights off he's almost 70 now and his knees arn't gettin any better.  Moose I'll get back to you with a PM, becuase i have essay to write today on Foster's rule for my evolution class.  Tight Lines everyone!!  -Dave"
