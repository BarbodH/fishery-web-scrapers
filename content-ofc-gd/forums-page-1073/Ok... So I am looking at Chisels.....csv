168311,douG,2008-03-07 00:58:00,2693,"Gotta love Lee Valley, always catering to the domestic market.  They also have a great sense of humour too."
168312,taper,2008-03-07 00:59:00,611,"Pretty lazy, betcha he's sold a bunch already even if they are as gag gifts he's making money."
168313,PatrickGG,2008-03-07 00:59:00,562,"Thats pretty funny, i guess somebody out there had tired thumbs and thought of a alternative."
168314,ccmtcanada,2008-03-07 00:59:00,7971,"So, how many did you order Gerritt?? LOL"
168316,Radnine,2008-03-07 01:10:00,1538,"I had a roll up the rim moment today. One of the kids in my class showed up after making a Timmyâ€™s run and naturally brought me one. After finishing it, I took off the lid to have a go only to realize that the rim had already been rolled! Oh well, maybe he can get the credit at summer school."
168318,mikeh,2008-03-07 01:22:00,824,   now thats funny..
168319,shane,2008-03-07 01:23:00,652, HaHaHa!!      serves him right
168323,tjsa,2008-03-07 01:32:00,1578," now thats just crazy, but I think lots of people will buy them, gag gift or not, lazy or not. I won 2 yrs. ago, the Coleman Camping package, using my thumbs and fingernails, along with about 12 coffees and cookie/donut freebies. Gave all the Coleman stuff to my nieces and sisters who could use them( I already have stuff like that for my personal use), for free, I would have bought the coffee anyways, regardless of winning."
168333,OhioFisherman,2008-03-07 02:07:00,6623,If you use sanding sticks probably a better deal here  http://www.blackbearcc.com/Tools.htm#x_acto
168335,danbouck,2008-03-07 02:08:00,4380,It's actually a very good idea! A lot of my clients have trouble handling things ( a lot have MS) and would not be able to roll them up.
168336,HTHM,2008-03-07 02:16:00,4082,"I have seen one in action, and it works very well."
168339,steve barrett,2008-03-07 02:20:00,142,Well guys it may be not mutch.But it is Canadian and is made in Canada. Way to go guys!
168341,mepps,2008-03-07 02:28:00,1301,I got one for my step dad for Christmas  He loves it.
168342,Casey123,2008-03-07 02:31:00,461,I am still pretty happy with my thumbs.
168343,bucktail,2008-03-07 02:33:00,1857,Thats brutal!!!!! But funny in a twisted sense!
168344,Bernie,2008-03-07 02:34:00,3190,I wish I had thought of it. Could take the summer off for the next ten years from the money it would make.
168352,Beans,2008-03-07 03:00:00,3339,"Looks like it would be great for guys like me with arthritic thumbs...  Unrolled a rim last Saturday with difficulty then they said ""Try Again""...thanks a helluva much..."
168383,Gerritt,2008-03-07 04:34:00,6129,am I the only one here they unrolls it with their bottom teeth?? grab is n pull... simple.  G
168397,KyleM,2008-03-07 07:49:00,218,"Gerrit, Im a tooth roller too!!!!  If its from LV, its probably the biggest rip-off going.  I think they have tools to de-claw your cat, they cater to the DIY, lazy, and brainless!"
168452,blaque,2008-03-07 14:23:00,2419,i was gonna say.......i didnt know anyone actually tried rolling it up with their thumbs......Im a bottom teeth guy myself.
168456,Raf,2008-03-07 14:40:00,3495,<-- bottom teeth guy
168469,wallyboss,2008-03-07 15:03:00,1095,Those came out last year and they were selling like hotcakes. they couldn't keep them on the shelves.  For  $2.50 why not encourage the guy that thought of it.
168498,walleyejigger,2008-03-07 16:05:00,876,"i'm a bottom teeth guy also  i also saw them in the lee valley catalog, last week i saw them for sale at the cash at the zellers in north bay, no i didnt buy one"
168504,crappieperchhunter,2008-03-07 16:17:00,2582,"Teether all the way !!! But I gotta tell yah, I'll be grabbing one for Debbe if I can get one local. She is a Horton's junkie and I know she would get a kick outta it. Besides her key chain weighs about 50LBS already. She wouldn't even notice a difference by sticking that little guy on there."
