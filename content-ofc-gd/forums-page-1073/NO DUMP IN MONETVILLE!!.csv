168291,Muskieman,2008-03-06 23:23:00,2472,The plan for a recycling plant in Monetville was shot down..... congrats to all how signed the petition..  Just heard it on MCTV news   ..:   
168294,Roy,2008-03-06 23:35:00,13728,Great news Randy. I know a few people who'll sleep easier now.
168409,SlowPoke,2008-03-07 10:26:00,2984,"Great news for Monetvillians but it'll just end up in someone elses backyard instead of finding a better solution. Gee, can't wait for Toronto's trash to arrive in London"
168415,Rich Clemens,2008-03-07 11:22:00,3131,"THat's great news for the folks in that area and for the French River.  Unfortunately, they'll be looking for another place now."
168539,wallyboss,2008-03-07 18:47:00,1095,I wonder why that it is not whoever makes the garbage recycles it.  Can't seem to understand why one by one all Northern Ontario towns will have to sign petitions not to have Toronto's garbage dumped on them.  The Ontario Government will keep trying until one town isn't big enough to fight back.
168541,Ben_Daniels,2008-03-07 18:53:00,435,I was under the impression that most of our garbage in Toronto and Ontario goes to the US...am I wrong?  -Ben
168553,Greencoachdog,2008-03-07 20:02:00,8163,  Like we don't have enough of our own???  I thought y'all fed it to the Bears.
168562,Greencoachdog,2008-03-07 20:30:00,8163, You are wrong... the Leafs have to go back to Canada when the hockey game is over.
168591,SlowPoke,2008-03-07 22:07:00,2984,A lot of it does right now but that is coming to an end. Michigan has been trying for several years to put a stop to it and introduced mini-bans on such things as plastic pop bottles etc. The Toronto-Michigan contract ends in 2010 and London will absorb the trash from that point on. http://www.cbc.ca/canada/toronto/story/200...onto-trash.html
168597,Cory,2008-03-07 22:21:00,170,"While this is good news, I'm still waiting to see it posted on some type of news website or the municipal website before I will believe it....call me cynical.  Wallyboss, this isn't the government doing this.  The townâ€™s council passed a bylaw to allow the rezoning of the land after Halton recycling purchased it.  Then the town tried to have the bylaw rescinded, but could not.  So they decided to spend more money and hire lawyers to appeal the bylaw.  Leave it to politicians to screw up a great area.  Hope everyone remembers them come the next election.  Here is the previous thread regarding this issue.  Halton in Noelville"
168682,wallyboss,2008-03-08 01:23:00,1095,Is that the same outfit that wanted to dump there garbage in the abandoned mine in Kirkland Lake???
168843,Cory,2008-03-08 14:57:00,170,"No the companies involved with the Adams mine project were Notre Development, Canadian Waste Services and Miller Waste Services."
168880,ChrisK,2008-03-08 16:41:00,2772,Thats great news !!!!!
