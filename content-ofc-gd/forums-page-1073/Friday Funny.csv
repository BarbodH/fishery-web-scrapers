All of the typical answers came up -- Fireman, Policeman, Salesman, etc.  Little Johnny was being uncharacteristically quiet and so the teacher asked him about his father. Johnny replied, 'Well, my dad's an exotic dancer in a gay bar and takes off all his clothes in front of other men. Sometimes, if the offer is really good, he'll go out to the alley With some guy and make love to him for money.  Little Johnny's teacher, obviously shaken by this statement hurriedly set the other children to work on some colouring, and took Johnny aside to ask him, if that was really true about his father?  'Well, not really said Johnny', 'He plays for the Leafs but I was too embarrassed to admit it in front of the other kids.'"

168440,Stoty,2008-03-07 13:41:00,2910,yes that one has been around for quite some time now.  but I think it would have more of an impact today if it was the Sens he played for.  Losing 2-0 to the worst team in the league...wow.
