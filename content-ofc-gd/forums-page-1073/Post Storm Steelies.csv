167923,ccmtcanada,2008-03-05 23:03:00,7971,"Well, after waking up this morning and seeing the snow and traffic heading into Toronto, I decided to take a snow day.  I took my little one public skating in the morning and then when she was off to school, I had nothing to do.  I thought about heading to the local trib, but was unsure.  Bly said I should at least go and look at the conditions, so I got all my gear together and headed down un-plowed streets to see what was swimming.  When I got there, most of my favourite holes were frozen solid, but did notice a few runs that had some open water.  The visibility was about 6 inches, so I had high hopes.  The first hole I went to was pretty slow, but I did manage to get one on....and promptly lost it.  It was then quiet for a few hours.  I kept trying different holes, and by this time the sun was out and it was a great day to be drifting.  I found another open spot and drifted as close as I could to the ice edge on the opposite bank.  My float went down and I set the hook....and lo and behold there was a fish on!  It was a little female....with some great colours.   After snagging a few times and re-tying, I tried to drift the same spot again.  This time my float went down and when it came to the surface it's tail actually broke thru the ice shelf!  I knew this one was bigger!  I was fishing high on a bank, so I had to lead the fish towards a spot where I could actually land the fish.  The battle went on for about 15 minutes...it kept trying to head down stream, but I managed to keep it's head facing upstream.  Finally, the this steelie came in.  It was 27.5"" and weighed 7 pounds!  My first decent sized steelie this year.  Here's the pic right after it was landed.....   Someone who was walking by offered to take a pic, so here's the same fish....   All in all, had a pretty good day out there....3 hours and 3 fish on...two landed."

168007,ccmtcanada,2008-03-06 01:47:00,7971," Thanks Scott...after reading your report yesterday about waters being muddy, I checked the levels of the creek online and they were steadily going down despite the snow.  I figured that if I could get out before the big melt, the waters may have cleared enough to catch some.  Looks like for once I was right...LOL."
168011,ccmtcanada,2008-03-06 01:58:00,7971," I already called my boss and told him I wasn't coming in because of the snow...  Mind you, he may have assumed I stayed at home all day and worked, but that's his fault...not mine...LOL."
168019,Joey,2008-03-06 02:20:00,9122,Now that's what I call a snow day.  Way to go Cliff  Joey

168057,ccmtcanada,2008-03-06 03:06:00,7971," Hey Grant...didn't know you wanted to try creek fishing.  We should try...the spring thaw is coming, so lots of opportunities next month!  We'll be in touch."
168062,tbayboy,2008-03-06 03:25:00,1497,Nice fish Cliff.  I skipped the drive today as well yet for some stupid reason I DID do work from home.  What a schmuck .  Next snow day I'm calling your place!
168068,kennyman,2008-03-06 03:38:00,737,"Wow,another beauty. Okay Cliff,teach me how to do this. What exactly did you catch them on? Is that some sort of floating egg pattern fly?"
168069,Greencoachdog,2008-03-06 03:43:00,8163,"You can't drive plowed salted roads to work, but can drive unplowed roads to go fishin'???   ... sounds like a good deal to me!!!  Great pics and beautiful fish!!!... How did it feel to have your string stetched?"

168124,fish_finder,2008-03-06 12:46:00,370,"gotta love those snow days!!     unfortunately, I don't get that luxury......ever  Nice fish man!"
168127,ccmtcanada,2008-03-06 13:08:00,7971," Hey Kennyman....I use my float setup....13foot rod, with a spinning reel.  Because of the visibility, I went with a shorter lead....about 2 feet.  From the swivel to the float was about 2 feet as well, with weights to keep my leader down.  I used roe (salmon...I haven't got any trout roe left), about looney size in chartreuse and pink bags."
168147,ricoboxing,2008-03-06 13:34:00,398,"nice fish! u gotta show me the ways sometime! I still havent caught a steelie. I checked the creek on monday, and it was mostly frozen"
