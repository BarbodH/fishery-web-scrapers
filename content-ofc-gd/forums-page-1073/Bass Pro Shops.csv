To my surprise there was not only one but two yes two $50.00 gift cards. Along with the cards was a nice letter of thanks for participating in the Tyler fund raiser from a George Wallace, Canadian Market Manager.  Thought this was a very nice gesture on their part and a very pleasant surprise.  The following are quotes from the letter  "" As you did so generously bid $100.00 in support of charity: we in return will extend our thanks by way of providing the same Gift Card Value""  "" Again thank you for thinking about the betterment of the communities we live in.""  George Wallace Canadian Market Manager Bass Pro Shops"
