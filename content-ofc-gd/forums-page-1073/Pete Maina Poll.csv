168757,bigbuck,2008-03-08 05:01:00,2449,"Pete, it was great talking to you and the rest of the TNB crew!!! Too bad you didn't have any of the signature Pete Maina pink fuzzball hats!!! LOL!!! Good fishing good buddies!!!"
168775,Marc Thorpe,2008-03-08 11:10:00,621,"  Ya and if it keeps going, Maina will have more wrinkles than Keith Richards"
168853,Pete Maina,2008-03-08 15:33:00,213,"Wrinkles? (That wasn't very nice John   Yikes ... I suppose I deserve it after the short comments)  I just can't resist though  AH, don't worry shorty, I'll be OK ... no worries ...   Anyway, it's impossible to have more wrinkles than Keith Richards.  Good to be able to chat with you Buck. Yeah, I think should have signature series pink hats for Bass Pro Shops. Speaking of that, dunno if any of you were watching Fox & Friends (get that up north?) this morning, but partner in The Next Bite, Gary Parsons, was on there with Jimmy Houston talking about a great promo Bass Pro is putting on. Kinda neat to see him on there with all the kids and reels and ...  Sweet J? I'm lost Sandy  Still cold as heck here. Hope spring comes soon.  Pete"
165925,SlowPoke,2008-02-29 14:16:00,2984,"Spicoli, Frampton, Plant... all good but you guys are missing the obvious.    Dee Snider"

166443,irishfield,2008-03-02 01:47:00,26272,I was gonna say.... at least Pete knows now who you're thinking of.....
166473,OhioFisherman,2008-03-02 03:43:00,6623,"Pete and Mark Zona were on tv here this morning, fishing, and catching Muskies in wisconsin. Pete didn`t even have his fish attracting head gear on!  Nice show!"
168307,Pete Maina,2008-03-07 00:44:00,213,"HI,  I just had to check in here to see what went on while I was away touring Bass Pro Shops stores ... still playing catchup here upon return, though can see a little light. (Was great to see you there at the Toronto store, Big Buck, if you're reading.)  (I see Miss Ess showed up here; cute ain't she   )  I see the vote tipped Framptonish ... a little scary after seeing him on that commercial.  Hey Marc, are you still short?  Roy?   (Got a letter from you btw, FYI, thanks)  Glad some of you saw and enjoyed the show I did with Mark Zona. We sure did have a good time. He is one crazy dude. Hey Ohio, funny you should say that about the headgear, it was actually in the boat but sadly didn't make the show. If you saw the part where we plugged the Brian Schram CD in though (I danced & ZOna did his Gene Simmons immitation) - the music worked big time ... literally right after what you saw on the show there - the cameraman was diving for the volume knob on the player as a fish was peeling line and he needed our audio to work (guess I had it a little loud).  Have any of you caught The Next Bite show I did with Shorty-Thorpe yet? It airs again tomorrow on Versus at 8:30 eastern.  Good to hear from you all and hope things are well. STill cold here, jeez ... supposed to be -15 tomorrow morning. Global freezing.  Pete"
168321,douG,2008-03-07 01:30:00,2693,"Wow, Pete Maina, right here.  Almost like a Chuck Norris post.  If you want to have hair like Chuck Norris, check here.  And...  No toupee for Chuck Norris.  His hair is too scared to fall out.  Hope this hleps."
168332,Crazyhook,2008-03-07 02:04:00,1154,damn if you think Marc is hsort.. he is about 4 inches taller then me!
168340,OhioFisherman,2008-03-07 02:27:00,6623,"LOL Pete, I enjoy seeing the pike and muskie shows on TV, nice to see how the tough guys fish, way too many rods out for me, looks like a lot of work!"
168450,Pete Maina,2008-03-07 14:18:00,213,"HI,   Good to hear from you guys. Great stuff DouG ... ""hair is too scared to fall out"" ... like that.  Ooops. Well I bet he likes hanging around you Crazyhook  I'm not so about being very tough, but when I troll on big flats, I do put lots of stuff out there ... to me, that's part of the fun.  Pete"

165755,OhioFisherman,2008-02-29 00:42:00,6623,"Pete looks younger than me, maybe the hat? LOL I saw The Nuge back when he played with the Amboy Dukes at a local concert here in Ohio. Woke up on a different planet someplace in Indiana to Journey to the Center of your mind, concert billed as the second woodstock back in the very early 70`s.  Nuge has got to be older than me. Pete just looks like he is having fun! It`s nice to be tall!"
