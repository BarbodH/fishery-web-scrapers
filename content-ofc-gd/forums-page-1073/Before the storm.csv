168854,silverstreak,2008-03-08 15:40:00,146,I wondered if it was worth breaking a path in the knee deep snow earlier this week (someone had to do it!!!) I got my answer soon enough. P.S. don't look for my foot prints today cause the path is gone again. Can you say Global Storming. Have fun digging out of this one.
