609082,John Bacon,2011-08-04 04:24:00,3277,"This is great timing... my parents sold the family cottage last year, not I can get my own.    Good day,  I am Dr. Linda Hill, I am a US citizen, 48 years Old.  I am one of those that took part in the Compensation in Nigeria many years ago and they refused to pay me, I had paid over $20,000 while in the US, trying to get my payment all to no avail. So I decided to travel over to Nigeria with all my compensation documents, and I was directed to meet Mr. Michael Craig, who is a member of COMPENSATION AWARD COMMITTEE, and I contacted him and he explained everything to me. He said whoever is contacting us through emails are fake. He took me to the paying bank for the claim of my Compensation payment.  Right now  I have received my compensation funds of $1,500,000.00 Moreover, Mr. Michael Craig, showed me the full information of those that are yet to receive their payments and I saw your name as one of the beneficiaries, and your email address, that is why I decided to email you to stop dealing with those people, they are not with your fund, they are only making money out of you.  I will advise you to contact Mr. Michael Craig directly through the below information.  ZENITH COMPENSATION HOUSE Name: Mr. Michael Craig E-mail: [email protected]  You really have to stop dealing with those people that are contacting you and telling you that your fund is with them, it is not in anyway with them, they are only taking advantage of you and they will dry you up until you have nothing. The only money I paid after I met Mr. Michael Craig was just $420 for the paper works, take note of that.   Thank You and Be Blessed.

609814,HTHM,2011-08-06 20:46:00,4082,"Reminds me of a story my father told me: He was working in a steel plant, and as a joke they sent the new guy to get a skyhook, so the kid goes to the yellow pages and orders a crane from a company called ""Skyhook"" The plant ended up having to pay the bill, and management was none too happy about it. They never tried to pull one over on that kid again."
