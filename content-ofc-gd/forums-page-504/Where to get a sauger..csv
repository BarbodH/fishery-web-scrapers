610277,bucktail,2011-08-08 17:20:00,1857,While reading thru posts I noticed a nice sauger on Rod Caster's avatar there is a picture of a sauger. It came to me that I cannot remember ever catching one. Where would the closest place to the GTA be for a good sauger bite?   Thanks  Darren
610281,ehg,2011-08-08 17:32:00,2666,Seems like sauger are found mostly around Kenora/Dryden and Ottawa river drainage. The Ontario record was caught in Detroit R. and weighed only 4.4 lbs.  Seems like somewhere on the Ottawa R. might be your best bet closest to GTA.
610283,Rod Caster,2011-08-08 17:42:00,5784,"  Also there are sauger in some lakes approaching the muskokas, but catching them is essentiall unheard of. Ottawa River is the best place for me."
610289,ehg,2011-08-08 17:47:00,2666,"Ya, there is a PDF from ministry that lists lakes with sauger in Ontario. I noticed Cecebe lake there but thought it would be waste of time. http://www.mnr.gov.on.ca/stdprodconsume/groups/lr/@mnr/@letsfish/documents/document/226829.pdf"
610290,Roy,2011-08-08 17:51:00,13728,Lots of sauger in the Larry and the Ottawa.
610301,Nipfisher,2011-08-08 18:10:00,2449,Tooo many Sauger in Big Abitibi if you ever head North. There just may be as many Sauger there as Mooneye and Walleye. They can get up to 3 lbs. in Abitibi as no one keps them do to them being so old and Mercury (heavy metals) content
610303,tomO,2011-08-08 18:12:00,363,Lot's in the Ohio River and saugeye also.
610305,Spiel,2011-08-08 18:14:00,9065,Some in Nipissing as well though I'm not sure they're easy to find.  I did have Joey out with me one evening when she caught a small one.
610309,Rod Caster,2011-08-08 18:16:00,5784,"  Really?? cool, didn't know they were there...although I'm not suprised as Nip seems to hold every species minus trout."
610312,Spiel,2011-08-08 18:18:00,9065, Nor did I till I saw it. I don't have a picture but Joey may have.   
610326,Joey,2011-08-08 18:49:00,9122,"I remember that Chris, let me see if I can dig it up."
610330,manitoubass2,2011-08-08 18:59:00,11391,"There are lots in Rainy river, not anywhere near that area though, lol.  Sometimes I fish them in the summer. They like to school up in the shallow mud flats in the evening. Easy fish for the kids to catch, and they get all excited thinking WALLEYE!!!!  They are feisty little fish though, they dont seem as finnicky as the walleye can be. Biggest on I've ever caught though was probably about 2lbs, butthey all seem to be that size here.  Some of them are really pretty fish though, when they aren't super dark at least"
610331,mike rousseau,2011-08-08 19:15:00,4661, really??  ive caught thousands of walleye on the larry... never seen a sauger... you learn something new every day i guess...
610385,Roy,2011-08-08 23:16:00,13728," There are places on the Larry that only hold sauger, very few yellows. Certain areas and times of the year on Lac St-Pierre for example."
610390,HTHM,2011-08-08 23:21:00,4082,I caught one at a lake near Solopaddlers camp last year. About a pound in size.
610401,Terry,2011-08-08 23:38:00,14456, yeah but Joey catches everything that swims
610405,Roy,2011-08-08 23:42:00,13728, As long as they're not suspended.
610413,mike rousseau,2011-08-08 23:55:00,4661, Neat...
610451,craigdritchie,2011-08-09 01:32:00,1586,"Ottawa River has lots, if you just want to catch one to say that you've done it. Most sauger are smallish fish ..... two pounds, tops."
610458,Joey,2011-08-09 01:57:00,9122,"    Damn straight  Can't find the picture, must have been on the old computer that bit the bippy this year"
