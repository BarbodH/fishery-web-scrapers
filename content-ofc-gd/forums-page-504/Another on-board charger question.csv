609639,wallyboss,2011-08-06 02:00:00,1095,I have another question. I just bought a Minn Kota 2 Bank charger. My motor is 12 volts I have 2 batteries hooked up in parallel so when I hook up my 2 bank charger do I need to disconnect the parallel circuit when I charge my 2 batteries. That is easily done but do I need to?
