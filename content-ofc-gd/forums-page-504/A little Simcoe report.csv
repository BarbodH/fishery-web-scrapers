I figured it was going to be a tough due to the conditions and my general lack of knowledge of Simcoe, well it was a tough day for me for sure Tried every technique I know and managed a measly 6"" perch for my efforts!!!  My son Brad on the other hand had a decent day he managed to land 3 nice smallies, by the Berkley scale they were all just shy of 5 pounds!  I will keep trying!!!     "

610434,lookinforwalleye,2011-08-09 00:58:00,4399,"yes indeed taught him everything he knows!!!  I haven`t caught a decent fish all year not helping team 8 much, I am saving myself for the upcoming Richter fly-in!!!  Seems everytime I take one of my sons to Simcoe they get a decent smallie, took Brad`s brother out a couple of years ago and his first ever smallie pushed 7 pounds. He has never bothered to go back and try and catch another his reason being he will in all likelyhood never catch another that big!!!"
