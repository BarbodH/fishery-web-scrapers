604355,BillM,2011-07-19 14:41:00,17367,"80-130lb flouro, why mess around?"
604586,Cookslav,2011-07-20 01:27:00,1457," Ditto, Wire leader, or Flouro depending on the conditions.   As far as hurting fish via them rolling in the line....I guess it happens, but I'm yet to have it happen to me. Maybe I'm lucky"
604751,Moosebunk,2011-07-20 15:31:00,3970,"I've caught a few pike before... some longer than my children.  Always been fine with 45lb steel & black nylon coated leaders.  Make my own with Berkeley wire and, P-Line or Berkeley snaps and swivels.  Lost two (bite offs above leader) and used 3 more on the last trip to Pym.  Two are still fine to use.  I swear, the two of my lost leaders in one week might have cost me... $2.  When they get mangled I just reuse the snaps and swivels on a new cut leader for pennies to make.  IF I hadn't been secure with this choice I could have used the 60lb.  Used the same for ice fishing and making quick-strikes.  Alot of the other stuff is expensive and overkill for pike... IMO.  And, floro less than 120lb makes me cringe after once interestingly seeing a pike ""greenstick"" fracture slice it's tooth through it for several inches..."
604982,highdrifter,2011-07-21 02:48:00,2534,"Pike aren't normally leader shy...  But if a fluoro leader gives you more confidence and inspires you to fish your baits well, then I'd say give them a try!  If your focus is more on the bait, you're less likely to get ansy and switch up baits all time, so your bait sees more water and there's a better chance that you get bit.  I use min 80lb fluoro and the best snaps and swivels I can buy.  My preferred length for casting is about 16in.  I've had baits ""outrun"" a shorter leader on the pop and you end up with more fowls.  cheers HD"
604997,Glaucus,2011-07-21 03:33:00,48,"Why not make your own fluoro leaders? It's quite simple. You can use what ever strength leader material, as well as snaps and swivels that you desire. Fluoro leaders are cheaper than steel leaders in the long run...they don't fray, twist, get mangled, or kinked like steel leaders do! A $15.00 fluoro leader will outlast $15.00 worth of steel leaders!!! It's not about invisibility....but durability.  Here's my old blog that was deleted by the powers that be here on Oh!FN.  Luckily it was saved and cached:   DIY fluorocarbon leaders  BTW,if you see a pike following your lure...then speed up your retrieve!"
605013,adolson,2011-07-21 05:36:00,783,"I'd never seen a pike follow a lure before, until last month. I saw one follow a Lucky Strike Bug Eye right up to the shore of the Montreal River, and along the side as I walked, watching it.. I don't know if it was because of the leader, but I was using a wire one. It was odd to see."
605098,mike rousseau,2011-07-21 15:57:00,4661,   Great how to ... Very descriptive ... Thnx
609649,walleye wanderer,2011-08-06 02:27:00,64, Great detailed DIY for the leaders but where does one find the SS thimbles?
609958,Dabluz,2011-08-07 17:12:00,701," I hate fluorocarbon.  I have tried it in 6 lb test, 15 lb test and 30 lb test and it's far weaker than mono.  It also stretches as much as most mono and clear mono is just as invisible. Sure, I could use 80 lb test instead of 25 or 30 lb test fluorocarbon but then, why not use 80 lb test clear mono?  The problem with 80 lb test mono or fluorocarbon is the fact that the lure no longer has any action.  I use stuff that I get from Europe.  It's 49 (10 kg) to 54 strand (15 kg) steel.  It's finer than 4 lb mono.  Flexible enough to tie knots in it but I prefer using tiny sleeves.  I admit that the stuff is very expensive but for a few dollars more, I'm sure that no pike can cut it with his teeth.  It's a primary principal of physics....something harder than fish teeth (steel) simply cannot be cut by fish teeth.  80 lb test....can you imagine using stuff like that?  No fishing rod on earth can lift an 80 lb weight so why use it?  I tried 80 to 100 lb test mono for handlining cod in over 300 feet of water with 1 to 3 lb sinkers but I have now turned to microfiber lines with much smaller sinkers and I have the benefit of almost zero stretch."
610009,baironhorse,2011-08-07 21:48:00,145,I used power pro 40-50lb without a problem
610012,Dave Bailey,2011-08-07 21:57:00,1641,"Just made some myself with some spare 20lb braided line. I was fishing for bass last week in an area where there were pike and/or musky, and after one or the other took a Slammer with a quick swipe of its head I decided I needed a steel leader. Also decided to try some topwater action and put a Chug Bug on. Mistake. Even a short steel leader sank the bug and made it useless, so it was back to the Slammers. Might try the braid leaders down at the bay tonight."
603734,Jacob,2011-07-17 23:31:00,186,"I'm just wondering what you use as a leader for pike, because i've noticed that a lot of pike are following right to the side of the boat when i use wire leaders.  So i thought about trying flourocarbon next time and i wanted to know lb test to use.  Most of the fish are in the 35 to 40 inch range, i'll mainly be fishing big hard bodied swimbaits, minnow baits and big soft plastics, most of the lures are 5 to 10 inches.  Thanks in advance  Jacob"
603735,Pikeslayer8,2011-07-17 23:42:00,336,"  hi Jacob, Im probably in the minority, but with the newer lines out, I havn't used a leader in years.  Easier to cast and more proficient in the water.  Good luck  Slayer8"
603740,DRIFTER_016,2011-07-18 00:00:00,10439,"On my recent trip to the Attawapiskat I only used 40# Seaguar flourocarbon leader material. I only had to retie a couple of times the whole week and I caught a bunch of big pike to 45"" and didn't have a single biteoff.  I use a good quality snap/swivel on the lure end and use a back to back UNI knot to join my leader to mainline."
603746,ChrisK,2011-07-18 00:15:00,2772,I'm one of the ones that count my blessings and go leaderless when targeting pike. Now if I'm targeting muskie well thats a different story all together. I like to use 80lb mono of some sort. Usually Triple fish or Seaguar with good heavy duty snap swivels.
603749,GoneFishin,2011-07-18 00:20:00,349,I've been using 17lb suffix flouro for years for pike chucking bass baits and almost never break my line. But if your chucking bigger baits I'd go with 40lb possible more if your baits are expensive
603796,LefroyFisherman,2011-07-18 01:42:00,602,"I use 40 pound power pro, no leader, caught tons of pike."
603797,LefroyFisherman,2011-07-18 01:42:00,602,I also use a double catch 80 pound swivel
603800,farsider,2011-07-18 01:57:00,456,"Now I always use min. 80lb Fluoro Leader.  I have had pike break 50lb braid like it was candy floss.  And personally, I would not want to have a break-off and have a lure stuck in the Pike's mouth...possibly killing it.  I know I am not the only one who has caught a fish with a lure or hook still stuck in its mouth.  I think the whole ""It'll rust out or work its way out"" is something we tell ourselves to lessen our guilt.  Pike are not leader shy.  I always catch as many or more as those in the boat who don't use a leader.  But don't think switching to Fluoro will stop follows.  It just comes with esox fishing.  Cheers,  Mark"
603801,GoneFishin,2011-07-18 02:04:00,349,The thin titanium line also works pretty well a lot of guys swear by it.
603805,mike rousseau,2011-07-18 02:28:00,4661,"I use 100lb floro to cast for musky... Part of the reason for the high lb test is the thicker diameter line doesn't hurt the fish as much when they ""death roll"" So I would use 80-100lb floro for those pike..."
603810,Roy,2011-07-18 02:40:00,13728, Changing type of leader will not encourage pike to strike. Use what you're comfortable with. Pike will hit a 6 ounce bottom bouncer tied to anchor line. I use fluoro leaders 50lb and up....not because they are less visible but because they are more convenient to tie and are available in a larger range of strengths.
603822,adolson,2011-07-18 03:16:00,783,"According to my grandpa, pike will hit an ANCHOR tied to anchor line!"
603828,TDunn,2011-07-18 03:40:00,680, Thats what I use during the summer and winter....Never have had a bite off. Send highdrifter a PM. He ties up some sweet leaders!   TDunn
603861,Rod Caster,2011-07-18 11:28:00,5784," Yup, a big pike tore a piece out of a walleye I had on a stringer tied to my canoe the other day. use a good steel stringer as a leader and you can tie several lures at the same time."
603868,bassman,2011-07-18 12:05:00,384," Ditto, i use 30lb fluoro for pike, 80lb for musky. No breaks off yet."
603882,Joeytier,2011-07-18 12:47:00,3990,"I've always just used whatever 40 or 50 lbs mono I could find that is relatively inexpensive.  I prefer xt.  But if i'm fishing dark/murky water, I'll just throw on a steel leader if I happen to have any."
604186,Jacob,2011-07-19 01:09:00,186," That's the same way i feel about breaking fish off, also a lot of the hooks that are used on pike lures are salt water hooks, which wil never rust out.  Thanks for all of the replies, i picked up some 50lb flouro for the next tome i'm out pike fishing.  Jacob"
604195,Gregoire,2011-07-19 01:31:00,1397,I'm going to try making the transition from fluoro to mono leaders for musky fishing.
604273,singingdog,2011-07-19 09:52:00,1047,"Was reading a great article on esox leaders the other day. The author was commenting on the irony of using ""invisible"" leaders on lures with 7/0 hooks dangling off of them"
604274,Roy,2011-07-19 09:58:00,13728, Ding Ding Ding! We have a winner!
604300,Gregoire,2011-07-19 12:19:00,1397,I use leaders made out of mono or fluoro to protect the fish. I feel as though braid would be more likely to damage the fish.
604302,Joeytier,2011-07-19 12:39:00,3990,I've had a wire leader pretty much tear the eye out of a fish once.  Thankfully he made a nice dinner.
604310,backbay,2011-07-19 12:55:00,773,"I use 30 or 40 lb seven strand wire available at BPS, and tie my own."
604331,mike rousseau,2011-07-19 13:40:00,4661,I believe it's also about fish safety...  Heavy floro or mono is less likely to hurt the fish if/when they roll up in your line... Thin wire leaders can bruise and cut the fish...  It's more about fish safety then you losing a fish
604337,NAW,2011-07-19 14:00:00,4022,"I make my own leaders using crimps, 55lb flouro and high quality swivel snaps.  Just started using them this year, and so far so good."
