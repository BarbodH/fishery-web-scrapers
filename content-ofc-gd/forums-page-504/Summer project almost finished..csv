609808,Daplumma,2011-08-06 20:12:00,1961,"Spent the morning ripping around town on this little number.Art and I bought a vintage cafe racer and returned her to the street.The previous owner had built this bike after he crashed his old one.He took it out once and lost his nerve.This motor has more horsepower than my Harley has!Its a 1978 SR 500 thunper.Lots of guts and a very sweet exhaust note.We had to install all the wiring and switches to run lights,horn and brake lights as well as a battery. Here is the before shot.  Here are some after shots.Still need a mirror and chain cover as well as some graphics after the paint is set up.       Joe"
609809,Big Cliff,2011-08-06 20:19:00,6899,"Around here we'd call that an ""organ donor"" bike, plenty of HP to get you into trouble. I must say though, it sure looks nice!  Nice job,   ride safe and enjoy!"
609810,kickingfrog,2011-08-06 20:21:00,8333,Sweet! Got one with training wheels for a canuck?
609817,aplumma,2011-08-06 21:06:00,6896,Cliff the horsepower to weight ratio is 1:7 roughly it is a blast to ride and with the high performance brakes and other additions it can be reeled in as fast as it accelerates. We spent a lot of time and money to bring this classic back to road life for all to see and enjoy. You are correct though you can be as safe as you can be but its the other person driving that can get you.   Art
