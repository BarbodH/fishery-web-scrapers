609903,ch312,2011-08-07 11:32:00,1590,"so, i finally decided to buy a 17.5 to 18.5 ft lund or princecraft walk through dual console for fishing big water. but, i am having a very hard time finding any used ones.  ive tried classifieds on forums, kijiji, autotrader, buysell, dealers, etc. is this just the worst time of year for buying a used boat or are people happy enough with these brands that they keep em forever?  any ideas?"

609915,Roy,2011-08-07 13:49:00,13728,I know it's quite the run for you but Thomas Marine is the largest Princecraft dealer there is and new or used they'll get you what you want. They have 5 outlets. They're now switching to a new format website so it's a little wonky but it'll give you some ideas.
609926,BillM,2011-08-07 14:49:00,17367,"Funny, I'm looking for something similar for the oldman.  You cannot beat the prices stateside."
609934,purekgw,2011-08-07 15:25:00,585,not sure of your price range but   http://www.hullygully.com/PreOwnedShowroom/tabid/75/Default.aspx?cat=Watercraft&sortPrice=ASC#top   they have a few used princecrafts
609951,mike rousseau,2011-08-07 16:42:00,4661,  Price range???? Year range??
609987,ch312,2011-08-07 19:55:00,1590, price range? whatever it costs to get a 2003 and newer (preferably 06+) 17.5+ boat   the prices on US boats is a lot better than here. i guess it's time to get a passport...
610008,baironhorse,2011-08-07 21:46:00,145,keep on looking End of AUg to Oct is a good time when boats pop up...search States side close to the boarder is an option...question is how much you wanna spend and how far would you go out of your way to get a boat!
610138,registerfly,2011-08-08 02:50:00,198,yep if you can wait hang back and wait til the season is almost over. Many will be looking to upgrade to the next best thing and sell off so they don't have to store for the winter.
