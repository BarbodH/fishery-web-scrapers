So last night I made arrangements for some quality time between my son and his grandma and off we went... Left the house and the weather was beautiful... Partly cloudy and basically no wind... 10 minute drive later... Blowing 30+ km/h and a storm cloud moving in... But surprisingly... The girls said ""let's give it a try... We are already here..."" no problem I says... Put the boat in the water... 5 minutes we got our first walleye... Now I'm starting to think it'll be a good night... So we hit a couple spots close by to be safe... Get a couple more walleye... Then the bad weather disappeared... Time to run the river... We finished the night at 11 walleye in 3 hours and I lost a big fish... If it was a walleye... And it felt like it was... It would have been my biggest... And the sister in law got her first walleye and even held it for a pic... 25""  "
