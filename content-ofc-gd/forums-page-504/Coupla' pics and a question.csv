I don't get out much anymore (baby) but have had a few outings under my belt thus far.  Quick question for yas, with some fish pics to share below...  Some friends and I are looking to get away for the weekend (next w/e).  What I'd like is a lake that offers a boat launch (any quality is fine for my dinghy) as well as crown land camping.  I've seen this on Wahwashkesh in the Parry sound area but am interested in the north Kawarthas/Apsley area - though I'm open to anywhere.  Decent fishing for any of bass/pike/walleye/muskie would be great.  Thanks for any suggestions.  Now, pics...  Family vacation to New Jersey beaches yielded loads of DIY baby sharks and a tasty skate (ray).  Also got some flounder, no pics.          Evening trip to scugog produced a hog LMB - spinner bait in the reeds.    Cheers,  MoB"
