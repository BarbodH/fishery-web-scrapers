609886,Dan668,2011-08-07 04:21:00,1120,"Vitor should be dq. First franklin now akiyama, so many shots to the back of the head. Dangerous, see how akiyama dropped dead. Yes vitor prob would of won, but those were straight illegal punches to the back of the head. Tito was finished after the first, looked like he had the guilotine like the bader fight but rashad was in half guard making it impossible. Rory mcdonald looked impressive again against pyle who is a tough fighter"
