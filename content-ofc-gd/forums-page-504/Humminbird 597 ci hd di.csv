610302,mike rousseau,2011-08-08 18:10:00,4661,hey  looking at a new color combo unit to replace my old black and white units... i have gps and fishfinder seperate right now...  anyways... looking for opinions on this unit or a comparable one... these are selling for about 600 buck... wich i dont think is very expensive for a color sonar/gps unit... especially with the down imaging...  thnx
610310,bigbuck,2011-08-08 18:16:00,2449,I looked at it during the Sportsmen's show and it looks like a decent unit esp. for the price. I'm probably going to pick one up next year for the boat.

Anchored solidly, the gps says i am moving .5-1.5 mph. the depth jumps around so much, i cant tell how deep i am.Lowrance on the bow say 8ft, humminbird on the console says 11.0, them 13.8, then 12.5, then 13.5 etc Bought it brand new in January and i am going to try and get a brand new one. If the new one does the same thing, you want to buy it  "
