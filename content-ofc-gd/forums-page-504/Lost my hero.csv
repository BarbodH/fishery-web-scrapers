609805,Pikeslayer,2011-08-06 19:34:00,1443,"Blair, Our sincere condolences to you and your kin. I cant think to add anything that hasn't already been written above. I hope many years from now, my grandchildren will remember me with fond memories and a kind tribute such as yours. You are truly blessed by a great man.  Sincerest sympathies,  Simon & Sean"
609813,NAW,2011-08-06 20:45:00,4022,"My condolences Blair,  I can tell from personal experience, that your grandpa did a perfect job is a mentor in our life.  He would be very happy to know you are naming your boat in his memory!  I'm sure you will be thinking of him when you break that 9lb Pb.. Heck, maybe you'l try to land it with out a net in his honor.."
609816,Black_Blade,2011-08-06 20:53:00,258,"Sorry to hear about your grandpa, Blair, but wow lived a good long life eh.  Reminds me of my dad and what he passed on to me.  That idea of putting graphics on your boat is a good one!"

609482,Nipfisher,2011-08-05 17:16:00,2449,"After posting last night on Wiser's thread about my grandpa living out his last days...he died peacefully in his sleep at 2am this morning. He was 97 years old.  Earl Rupert Duffield born March 25, 1914 - Not an ordinary Grandpa. My mother left my father in 1980 taking us 3 boys with her from B.C. to Kirkland Lake, Ontario. My Grandpa immediately stepped up and took on the ""fathering role"" He taught my little brother how to ride a bike the 1st summer we were there. He taght us all how to hunt, fish, drive, and how to be a man. Not sure how many hockey skates he tied lol. He NEVER drank or smoked a day in his life. He was a tough man that didn't complain. I have only seen him cry once, when my Grandma died 5 years ago. He continued to live independantly, drive, and joined his hunting group every fall until he was 95. He landed my P.B. walleye (9 lbs.) without a net and I will never forget that day. I have a great picture I will scan and post later.  Just wanted to share with you all. I will celebrate his life and miss him every single day.  Mercman, My boat will will have E.R.D. 97 added on with vinyl graphics as soon as I am back in town."
609486,blarg,2011-08-05 17:20:00,289,Condolences to you and your family.
609490,adolson,2011-08-05 17:27:00,783,"I'm sorry to hear that, man. He sounds like an excellent role model, and I'm glad you got to spend that time with someone so respectable. I'm really sorry for your loss.  I lost my grandma last year, the sweetest lady I've ever known. The sting of losing her was amplified by my family deciding that her birthday was most certainly not an appropriate day to hold her funeral. Instead, they held it on MY birthday. I couldn't even stay for the whole thing because I had scheduled my G driving test for my birthday, figuring, there's no way that if she passed on, that my family would put it on my birthday. Oh how wrong I was. I don't think she would have been impressed with them. But anyhow, it sucks when we lose true gems."
609494,Big Cliff,2011-08-05 17:39:00,6899,"What a wonderful tribute! The legacy he left behind is in you and your brothers and I am sure will be carried on through your children and their children's children. While he may be gone the things he did will have an effect for ever. Keep him in your heart, I have a feeling he'd like it there!  God Bless!"
609498,John,2011-08-05 17:51:00,2956,Very sorry to hear of your loss. You wrote a great tribute to your Grandpa. I'm sure that he will be with you always.

609582,bigugli,2011-08-05 21:48:00,6138,"Do not be sad. He lived a long and full life, and blessed your family with more than a lifetime of memories. He was, obviously , a great influence on your life. Pass on what he passed on to you, and he lives forever."
609589,spincast,2011-08-05 22:04:00,3279,"Condolences on your loss. He was obviously a man of great stature  - (height is measured in inches; stature is measured by how others percieve us). As others have said -  From what you have shared I do not think he would want you to mourn his passing, but rather celebrate his life."
