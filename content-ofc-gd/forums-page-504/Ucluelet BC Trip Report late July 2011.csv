Gorgeous colours!   This was my fish-the scrapes you can see came from a  Shark who tried and failed to snatch the fish as I was fighting it.   Local denizen   Waiting on a Hali bite   Good Night Nurse!   Lotsa Butts!   Self explanatory   This is how you spell success!   One of the nicest WCVI days in recent memory        Closeup of Shark bite/scrape
