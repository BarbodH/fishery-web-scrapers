609709,Photoz,2011-08-06 11:51:00,792,"I musta somehow missed your post . . .    was just checkin' back this mornin,' and there ya wuzz, proudly displaying a 20+ pounder, so ya STILL got it! I was up on Saturday & Sunday, 5 fish both days, same as Ron. I think there was only one over 20 pounds . . .     most were 'turbo-charged 10  -  12 pounders. I had to give up the best fish of the weekend though . . . .     I just got 'im on, and I received a rather urgent message from Mother Nature, that I would be needing a 'nest' within the next few minutes. I hollered for Ron to 'reel in,' and navigate my fish in . . . .    I NEEDED TO DO SOME BUSINESS . . . . .    NOW! I didn't have a prayer of breaking off the 65 pound Power Pro, and was considerin' tying the fish to my back bumper, and reefin' 'in with the van! Lucky the 'nesting area' was only 2 minutes away . . .    3 minutes would have been messy! I have next Thursday & Friday off . . .    might go to Peterpatch, maybe to Trent River . . .   interested . . . .    Ron & the Brit are going too?"
