My point is it'd be physically impossible to drink enough near-beers to get drunk.  You can't physically consume that much.  Get it?  You can't even drink as many near-beers as beer....because the beer dehydrates you.  Coffee and soda as well.

609586,RyanT,2011-08-05 21:59:00,72,  It seems like most of the 0.5% beer actually doesn't have 0.5%... most have less... like 0.1%  I saw a chart that had all the percentages.  Another poster earlier said they just label them at 0.5% because have to or something.   
609588,RyanT,2011-08-05 22:03:00,72," He just means you couldn't drink 50 non-alcoholic beers and get drunk in the boat...  Like, try as hard you want... but you'll never get drunk off the stuff.  I think I even saw something on tv where they did try.. maybe it was Mythbusters..."
609593,brkygetr,2011-08-05 22:08:00,425,"Well fellas...interesting topic??? I can tell you from first hand experience that I have gone through 2 RIDE programs with a near beer in the console, blatently visible and indicated to the officer. No real booze in the system, I have a long drive every day and I like beer, and they did not have a problem. If they had asked for a roadside test I would have been more than happy to oblige as I am actually quite curious as to the results. As far as the boat is concerned I am sure that if you had no 'real' booze in the boat there should be no problem. If there was a problem then don't worry about it cause I highly doubt a court of law would find you guilty of anything except wasting their time and our money. Just my 2 cents. Not a lawyer,doctor,scientist, or cop... but I think I am on the right track. Just don't drink 50 or your fishing partner is gonna be pissed, at your pissing. Have at' ER!!! She's all good."
609624,BillM,2011-08-06 00:39:00,17367," You think a 5% alcohol content makes that much of a difference?  LOL!!!  You make it sound like I could drink 10 normal beers, but couldn't come even close to drinking that same amount in water.  Seriously man, think about it for a second..  Beer is 95% water!!!!"
609645,mercman,2011-08-06 02:20:00,7054,"Amateurs, all of you.................  Before i almost died, i would drink 12-14 beers from 6 till 11.30 pm.Every weeknite. On the weekends, i could easily put away 2 cases of 24 per day.Easily, and without feeling bloated.The AVERAGE person could not do that. People like me have a natural tolerance of alcohol,which decreases the longer we keep drinking. So, yes you can drink 50 cans of near beer, or any other liquid for that matter. But why would you want to. If you are drinking them cause you like them, and prefer them to soft drink, then Bravo to you!!! Enjoy !! But if you are drinking them cause they help you get by until you get home to the real stuff...then.... maybe you should be asking yourself a few questions."
609665,Rich,2011-08-06 03:16:00,3927,"Whatever kinda beverage you prefer, keep your 50 cans in the boat."

609685,cram,2011-08-06 04:33:00,1733," Beer dehydrates you as you drink it - drink a litre, lose more than a litre in pee.  When you drink near beer or water, you don't dehydrate faster than you take it in.   In fact, its even possible to die from drinking too much water if you're taking it in way faster than your kidneys can get rid of it."

""drink a litre, lose more than a litre in pee"" is a ignorant statement.  I see where you are coming from, but alot of your statements are false.  Water is also a diuretic, and if you somehow managed to measure water intake vs. water loss, or should I say fluid loss,  they would not be equal, nor would water loss be greater.   and drinking 50 near beers would not likely kill you, unless there was pending medical issues or ridiculous circumstances involved.    "
609690,RyanT,2011-08-06 05:08:00,72,"  You can't drink that much...not in any time-frame that would allow for the alcohol in Non-Alcoholic Beer to take effect.  Also, most Non-Alcoholic Beer falls way under the 0.5% mark... so if you're trying to get drunk off the wrong brand you're twice as stupid if not more.  Also, drinking too much water reasonably fast (like 50 cans of water or not even that much) can also cause serious problems... messes with the electrolytes/metabolism/chemistry/blah blah blah...   just don't do it."

If you drink 2 500ml bottles of water, per hour, for a 24 hour period, the odds of any adverse effects would be slim to none. Maybe lack of sleep due to frequent urination???  Nobody is going to drink 50 near beers anyways, not in one day anyhow. So how did this thread get so off topic???  If you really want an answer to the original question, call the MNR or police and ask them.     "
609695,RyanT,2011-08-06 06:01:00,72," Wow, you've  missed the point buddy... just right over your head.  For someone to get drunk off Non-Alcoholic Beer they would have to consume (let's speculate and say 50 beers is the drunk mark) 50 beers in like 30 minutes...  nobody can physically do that with NA Beer or with water.  (Google Hyper-hydration, buddy)   Now you ask how this thread got so off topic... well, it WAS on topic until your post actually.  I've highlighted the parts of your post that do not help...  there's a serious logic and comprehension fail on your part in your main point with respect to what has been discussed."

609420,RyanT,2011-08-05 14:47:00,72,I'm a big fan of the Quebec Regulations.  It's okay to drink in the boat... just not the driver/operator.  It's not okay to get drunk in the boat though... they will bust you for that if they think you're intoxicated even if you're not driving.  Had a good conversation with a Quebec CO about it while my buddy searched his truck for his license.  They were nice enough to follow us back to shore to get it and give him a day  or 2 to produce it when he couldn't find it.

Getting served with a ticket for BWI is about blood alcohol content not about the % in the bottle of what you are drinking. The worst they could serve you with is open container on a nerbeer and that could be challenged in court. If the breathalizer is above the limit then the BWI becomes an issue. I don't drink often so waiting till I am home or in a place were their is no question if it is legal is easy for me.   Art
609489,cram,2011-08-05 17:22:00,1733,Guys - it is literally impossible to get drunk on near beer.  Your kidneys would fail before your blood alcohol increased to a measurable level.  It is completely legal.

609492,RyanT,2011-08-05 17:32:00,72,Most non-alcoholic beers aren't even 0.5%... they're less.  I saw a chart that had about half of the ones listed at 0.1%.

609538,cram,2011-08-05 20:19:00,1733,One of the reasons you can drink a lot of beer is because alcohol dehydrates and you end up peeing out the fluid.  Not so with near-beer or water.   You could not sit down and drink 50 near beers.  Your kidneys would fail and you'd die first.
609542,fishing n autograph,2011-08-05 20:29:00,2540,Yes but you don't swallow mouthwash....or you shouldn't lol and if you spit it out the mouthwash then the mouth alcohol or the remnant of the mouthwash is out of your system in 15 minutes
