610195,Roy,2011-08-08 13:00:00,13728,Gagnon's have no worry with sail. They sell clothing more than anything else. If you enjoy shopping for haberdashery you'll like the place. Try their website as an appetizer.

610217,Dave Bailey,2011-08-08 14:21:00,1641," Agreed, a lot of people were predicting the demise of local tackle shops when BassPro opened up, but Barkley's was the only one that appeared to close. BP has a dizzying selection, but if you just want to grab something quickly and get going the smaller local stores are still the way to go. Gagnon should survive."
610445,asdve23rveavwa,2011-08-09 01:24:00,2690," It will be interesting to see if Sail improves on their current stores, but, for now it's a good thing I won't be able to make this event at Gagnon's, cause they definitely have a thing or two, or three, or  that I would be interested in."
610464,backbay,2011-08-09 02:21:00,773,"Haven't been to PQ to visit Sail so I can't comment, but I have to say I'm trying to rearrange my schedule to get out to Gagnons's tomorrow!"
