We had picked up a dozen worms and had a few hooks, pretty basic just to see if we could get a bite.  We pulled into the old Scandia Inn and walked down the the lake.  Sure looked good with lots of minnows swimming around...good sized ones too.  Didn't get any bites with our hook and worm under a bobber tho.  Does anyone know what kind of fish swims in this lake by the highway?"
609855,irishfield,2011-08-07 00:55:00,26272,James is supposed to have Pike and Smallies in it.

609905,Black_Blade,2011-08-07 11:37:00,258,"ahh ok, no surprise then it was quiet fishing from shore then.  Yeah took a pic of lake with my phone, always on the lookout for a new desktop pic  If had the money, that location (Scandia Inn) has so much potential, with all the traffic hwy 11 sees..."
610005,Nipfisher,2011-08-07 21:32:00,2449,I have googled Scandia Inn and James Lake (Northern Ontario) and there is not much about them. Anyone know why it closed? My little brother attended a friend's b-day supper there about 25 years ago.
