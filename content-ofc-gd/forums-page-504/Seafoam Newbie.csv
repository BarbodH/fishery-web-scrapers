609703,solopaddler,2011-08-06 10:28:00,8605,I would dump the entire can into a full gas tank to clean up an older 2 stroke.
609706,scugpg,2011-08-06 10:59:00,1373,After full can change plugs and use amsoil synthetic oil  for 2 stroke mix going forward
609846,baironhorse,2011-08-07 00:29:00,145,where could I get some amsoil synthetic oil ? 
609847,baironhorse,2011-08-07 00:30:00,145,what about quicksilver 2s oil? 
609848,baironhorse,2011-08-07 00:36:00,145,hey solo So you suggest dump the whole can? Ok dump the can and operate engine as usual? Or should I let it get into engine let sit for a hour or so and the start engine again? Let me know exactly what to do. thanks

609885,danc,2011-08-07 04:05:00,4677,"If you go to the seafoam website, it will tell you exactly how to use it for your situation."
610004,Nipfisher,2011-08-07 21:29:00,2449,I used 1/2 can at the beginning of the season into about 80 litres of gas. I add a bit more when I refil. I like to keep it above 1/4 because I'm out on the big lake. Ask Randy from Sturgeon about Sea-Foam I think he drinks the stuff.
