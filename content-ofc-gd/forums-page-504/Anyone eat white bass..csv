Are they any good? BTW got 2 5 pound eyes and a 3 pounder in 60 feet, right on the international border.   D"
610286,Rod Caster,2011-08-08 17:44:00,5784,"  FANTASTIC!!! it's suprising how good the meat is, I'd recommend it to anyone. It's also the easiest fish to clean...  I gave some fillets to my parents and they are seasoned speckled trout/walleye/perch eaters...they couldnt' stop talking about how nice the meat was and that they liked it more than walleye...yes, MORE than walleye!"
610293,Rod Caster,2011-08-08 17:53:00,5784,"  Hahaha, I have two more white bass filets in the freezer and a few walleye sides, maybe I'll do some blind taste tests to seperate the facts from the hysteria!"
610295,cl_fishin,2011-08-08 17:55:00,138,"They are quite good just be sure to remove the ""mudline"" on the skin side, it can spoil the taste of the fillet"
610311,Spiel,2011-08-08 18:16:00,9065,"I have a friend who goes nuts for them every spring on Erie Darren, says they're to die for.  Personally, never tasted one."
610323,Headhunter,2011-08-08 18:43:00,5703,I decided to try some a while back... they tasted like a dried boot... but that may have been a result of the body of water they were caught in... ie Quinte... the colon of the Trent system. Fishheadjoe
610332,Joeytier,2011-08-08 19:20:00,3990,"I kept a couple out of Nip this spring...Pan fried and battered, they're on par with walleye and perch as far as I'm concerned.  Excellent eating fish."
610441,pikehunter,2011-08-09 01:19:00,1659,"All subjective I think. Tried it, didn't like it, son likes it though. To me it tastes a little strong but fried up nice white and flakey. To me it tasted nothing like walleye."
