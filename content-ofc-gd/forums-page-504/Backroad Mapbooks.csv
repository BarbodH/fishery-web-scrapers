609920,Jer,2011-08-07 14:18:00,1426,"Does anyone know who carries the ""Backroad Mapbook"" publications?  We're off to Crotch Lake tomorrow for a few days and the only decent map I had of the lake was in my Backroad Mapbook for Eastern Ontario. I can't find the book and wanna grab another copy. For the life of me, I can't remember where I bought them previously. I still have the Kawartha and Haliburton books, just need the eastern Ontario version.  Thanks."
