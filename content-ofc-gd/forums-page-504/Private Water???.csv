609720,audio_mad,2011-08-06 12:53:00,28,"We were fishing at Cook's Bay yesterday and tried some docks. All of a sudden an owner of a dock showed up and threatened to call the cops if we don't disappear within 2 minutes, the guy was super aggressive and claimed we need not to get closer that 300ft to his dock because 300ft of water in Simcoe (straight from his dock) is his private property indicated in his survey. As far as I know water is public, he begged to differ. Does anyone know if there is such a thing as a private water??? On a separate note, we were not even casting under his dock, just working the weeds about 12-15 feet from his dock....."
609723,dada2727,2011-08-06 13:02:00,108,"here we go again.......  tell him to call the cops, by the time they get there you'll be long gone anyways and he'll look like an idiot."
609724,Jer,2011-08-06 13:02:00,1426,You should have let him call the cops...
609725,kickingfrog,2011-08-06 13:04:00,8333,"Option 1: Tell him you know he's full of it,and encourage him to call the cops because it is illegal to harass an angler who is legally fishing.  Option 2: Just continue fishing and act like you can't hear him. Video tape him jumping up and down like a 3 year old who isn't getting he's way and post it on the net so we can all laugh it him.  Option 3: Tell him he's full of it, but move on. Life's too short to worry about trying to correct every moron who is talkin' out his  ."
609728,Rod Caster,2011-08-06 13:08:00,5784,  I like Option 2
609729,kickingfrog,2011-08-06 13:09:00,8333,A combination of 1 and 2 would be better.
609743,spincast,2011-08-06 13:53:00,3279,"Option 4. Carry a super soaker, give him a dose, and THEN video tape him jumping like 3 year old"
609744,Garnet,2011-08-06 14:01:00,2056,Communicate with him in sign language it just total baffles idiots.
609745,hookerdown,2011-08-06 14:16:00,110,  Now thats funny!!!!
609749,mercman,2011-08-06 14:35:00,7054,"He has probably had a bad experience with anglers in the past, pitching under his dock.Maybe scratched his boat, or left a hook somewhere on his dock.Not everyone who fishes is polite and respectful like all of us in here. I would have said sorry for disturbing you sir, we will be gone in just a moment. Then when he turns to go, flip him the bird  But thats just me"
609751,4x4bassin,2011-08-06 14:54:00,1025,Option 2 would be my choice
609755,lplp,2011-08-06 15:08:00,83,"You should of asked him how much he paid for the water ,and made him an offer ,or tell him that this is my water from yesterday and just trying to bring it back to my place because i own 320 feet of water ."
609763,chessy,2011-08-06 15:34:00,610,becareful boys as there is some water lots out there... for instance port hope has a few ..i do not know this case but have done the research in my area and the town of port hope even owns a 50 - 75 feet out into lake ontario ..
609764,Dutch,2011-08-06 15:44:00,831,"Not worth it to raise a stink, especially with an aggressive property owner even if they have no foot to stand on.  They probably know they don't own the land and are just making that comment to get you to move on.  Confrontations are the reason fishermen get a bad name, that's not good for our sport.  Best just to not respond and move on."
609765,Roy,2011-08-06 15:44:00,13728,"I know of a few privately owned chunks in Ontario. Personally, life's too short to start bickering with someone who thinks he owns the water. Just smile, wish him a fine day and move on. From a legal standpoint though, without signage, his stand is unenforceable.  Edited to add: Just saw Dutch's post. You're right on the money."
609768,bushart,2011-08-06 15:53:00,2628,Dang---I was all set to git me a new slingshot  Then ya'll went adult on me
609780,Tootsie II,2011-08-06 16:57:00,162,"Chessy is correct. There are such things as ""water lots"" on some Ontario lakes. I once had to survey one ( install the on-shore monumentation  ie: iron bars ) for one on Lake Minisinakwa in Gogama when I worked for an OLS in Timmins in the late 60's. I believe that one also extended about 300 ft into the lake. I believe they are meant primarily to permit tourist type development such as fishing camps and the like. I also believe you have to have a heck of a lot of political pull to ever get one."
609784,bushart,2011-08-06 17:09:00,2628,I could see someone owning the bottom extending into the water a bit  But your actually levitating so to speak over said bottom.  And if it's navigible water---good luck
609785,adempsey,2011-08-06 17:31:00,1498,I remember reading about some private land on Lake Simcoe that includes part of the lake.  I believe it had something to do with harvesting ice back in the day.  No clue if it's still the case now though.
609787,chessy,2011-08-06 17:40:00,610,"what you have to do is go to the mnr and get the ""patton Deed""  the deed will tell you .... and as far as the water issue ... the deeds usually says ""together with the woods and waters forever"""
609791,Big Cliff,2011-08-06 18:03:00,6899,"Well, my understanding is that: ""It is illeagel to unauthorized post or restrict access to any navigatable water way in Ontario and the fine for doing so is $150.00"". I would inform him of this and ask him to please call the cops because you will ask that he be charged with that and harassment! Would you like me to dial the number for you sir?"
609794,cram,2011-08-06 18:18:00,1733,There are private water lots in Lake Simcoe.   Not sure where though.
609801,Cast-Away,2011-08-06 18:56:00,790,The only private water I know of is just south of King's Bay on GBay. The Queen deeded it to The Tadenac Fishing Club back in the 1800's.
609802,splashhopper,2011-08-06 19:11:00,2931,I would have given him some face language that resembles me licking an ice cream from the bottom up.... then video taped him !
609828,Rich,2011-08-06 22:16:00,3927,"I've been in similar situations. I just keep fishing and tell them to call the police. Say nothing else, just keep fishing. Either the cops never come, or they come and ask you kindly to leave to avoid incident."
