610040,mercman,2011-08-07 23:37:00,7054,"When i asked her if she liked to fish, she said ""Dont know, never tried.I had stopped fishing shortly after she was born, 29 years ago.Too busy in self destruct mode back then. Got her a rod, and the wife and i and my daughter hit the water around noon. Within 20 minutes she said ""Dad, something is wrong here, i think i'm on the bottom"" From the front of the boat, i could hear the line screaming off her reel.Then i remembered that i hadnt set the drag on her reel. I made my way to the back, tightened the drag and told her to bring it home.As it got closer to the boat, i saw it, a nice 36 inch pike covered in weeds.No net in the boat I grabbed the leader, and it came out of the water comletely, and proceeded to shake, pulling apart a 30lb snap swivel. Here is the only pic that my wife was able to get. Cant see the fish, but you get the idea   After that, we moved and she got into  a nice little Smallie    She was pumped, and i was a proud Dad. The seed was planted,, and she is itchin to get back out again"

She learned to cast really quick today, and had no fear of holding the fish or putting bait on her hook Chip off the ole block?   I do know she has all the right moves."
