52580,frozen-fire,2007-03-28 03:02:00,542,When you say spits.. .you mean Leslie street spit?  I was at the spadina quay marina cause i read somewhere that they can bring in some nice pike... nothing. Did see a couple guys try the marina out in a boat too... nothing.  I thought I was gonna catch my first pike ever...but it didn't happen.

52588,frozen-fire,2007-03-28 03:14:00,542,"haha...urbanangler, I thought I was gonna have a pic like your av to show you guys on here tonight...  So I can fish any part of the downtown shore all the way to Ontario Place? Is there any place I should watch out for? Like places that don't allow fishing and whatnot? I noticed at the marina that there were no fishing signs on the docks... but i was casting from the concrete shore. This allowed? I want to go out another time before April starts."
52670,BFSC Kevin,2007-03-28 12:45:00,1351,"hey frozen fire.. if i were you, i'd look around your local ponds, some of those hold some nice fish.."
