When I walked in I noticed an Etrex handheld GPS, not having a GPS for the boat I negotiated a trade of the clubs for the GPS  . It is a basic unit but at least now I can have accurate trolling speeds, and route backtracking on unfamiliar lakes and finally save some waypoints of hotspots. This season is slowly looking up, and don't worry the clubs were a cheap set of Dunlops from years ago and I have been playing with the GPS already and it works fine."
52023,walleyejigger,2007-03-26 17:37:00,876,"good for you, i'm sure you'll get more use out of the GPS than the clubs"
52027,Terry,2007-03-26 17:44:00,14456,"yeah I through my clubs away years ago, got in the way of fishing.....  you are going to love having a GPS in the boat"
52028,misfish,2007-03-26 17:46:00,29133,"Just make sure you tie it down.  Ah golf,I remember when it was only 20 bucks to play,now you cant leave without dropping 150 bucks."
52038,express168,2007-03-26 18:14:00,327,"After buying a boat I can't justify not using it everytime I have sparetime, so golf took a back seat years ago."
52166,Blake,2007-03-27 01:12:00,418,Good trade for sure.  You can always rent a set of clubs if you go golfing.
52216,POLLIWOGG,2007-03-27 04:37:00,835,"If you can get paper charts for your water you got it made, I still use the gps with a chart on my lap."
