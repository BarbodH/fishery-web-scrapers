52167,Marty,2007-03-27 01:14:00,873,The problem for the Leafs is that there are more than 6 teams in the league.   It was alot easier when they only had to beat out 5 other teams.  Go Pens!
52178,Terry,2007-03-27 01:32:00,14456,"I don't know about that, it seems the whole league now has the same number of really good players that the league  had back with the original 6, just spread out over more teams"
52022,Northhunter,2007-03-26 17:35:00,214,"Blaque - every team that's expected to be a ""contender"" or a finalist is over-hyped. It's a different group of teams every year, but from the first minute of the first playoff game on, it's a free for all where anything can happen. Detroit, San Jose, Anaheim, Buffalo.. all ""contenders"". I wouldn't be surprised if none of them make it and it's a Minnesota/Atlanta final or something of that nature.  The home and home on the weekend were playoff atmosphere games.. for the Leafs. Buffalo currently has a 5 point lead and a game in hand over Ottawa for the top seed. They've done their job so far. Maybe they remember last year and are waiting until April to show they have something to prove?  Better than being Montreal right now, IMO, who started out 20-7 but have to play playoff hockey for a month and a half just to make it to the big show."
52058,blaque,2007-03-26 19:08:00,2419,"I know guys, im being a little facetious, a little. I just dont think they are the powerhouse, freight train team that  alot of people are calling on to go all the way.   Like North said,.......once the series start , its a fresh slate, new season.....just like last year when no-one chose buffalo to make it to the semifinals. They were playng amazing in the playoffs. Like nothing could go wrong (which in the end it did) but Im not getting that ""feel"" at all goin in this year. The effort, the chances, the bounces , everything that goes with stompin your way thru teams to get to the finals....just isnt there right now if ya ask me. Maybe overrated is a harsh term. Lets just say i dont think they are playnig to their ability right now. And they better step up their dismal power play and questionable penalty kill if they want to go anywhere. Let alone a work ethic. I didnt mean to sound ingrateful at how we are doing over all this year lol. I know were pretty lucky to have a team like them to watch, I also know they have tailed off a bit and it is concerning to think of wasting such a wonderful season by not having their heads together for the playoffs.  Im a pesimist   Im the first guy to throw in the towel when they go down 3-1, The ""forget it, its over"" guy lol, till they come back to tie it up, and then im back up in my seat all fired up again. lol. I rarely miss a game (tv, or live if i can) and actually dont think i missed watching a game all year this year. Im also pretty firm that if the Sabres dont win it all, Id like to see one of the teams up north take the cup back to canada. See, even some of us ""Yanks"" know where the heart of hockey really lies."
52071,Headhunter,2007-03-26 19:46:00,5703,"The best thing that could happen to the Leafs, from a Leaf fan's perspective would be for them to not make the playoffs, for the next three years! They have to re-build and in todays NHL, you can't buy a team like you used to! The best thing that could happen to the Leaf's from a management point of view, would be for the Leafs to get into the playoffs, so they can gather all that playoff money and give it to the Teachers Pension Plan! It's pretty obvious that these two groups have completely separate agendas. The only way the situation at MLSE will change, is when The Teachers Pension Plan no longer holds the shares they do and the upper managment of MLSE, Peddie and his cronies, are turffed out the door! The Leaf's need a hockey guy in charge, not the current management or ownership! HH"
52073,bassmaster4,2007-03-26 19:48:00,801,   Raycroft is good hes came through when they relied on him most of the time and sometimes they relied too much on him when they blew that three goal lead for instance it was horrible a goalie cant play good without some help from the guys around him.
52096,Puckhead,2007-03-26 20:52:00,377,"Sorry man but I completely disagree with you.  He's a decent goalie, and he seems like a good guy - plus he's got to have the best goalie helmet in the league,  but he's still got the second or third worst save % in the league.  Granted the leafs D is so so, but you can't expect to be playing behing pronger and neidermayer every day before you can crack the 900's in SP.  You need a goalie to steal a game 6 or 7 times a year (or in NJ's case, every week), to win in the NHL.  Raycroft isn't that kind of goalie.  Raycroft needed to make a big save on Friday night to stop the momentum. (Maurice needed to call a timeout too - big screw up on his end IMO).  These are the situations that defines whether a team is going places or busting out the golf clubs.  You need your goalie to make that big save and he isn't stepping up to the plate.  Especially considering Rask and about 4 mil in cap space over the next three years was sacrificed for the third worst goalie in the league.  I hope he turns it up somehow - but it seems to me, high 800's is about all you can expect from Raycroft."
50953,misfish,2007-03-23 19:34:00,29133,"The buds need 3 of the four points this weekend,starting tonight with the sabres to have any hope at all.  Im not sure they have the heart like the old buds of past,but I sure would like to see a Sabers/leafs first round.That could be a real donny brook. Put the first place team out, after that, who knows what they could do.  Time for Sundin to step up,be the captian and lead them on. If not, well give the ""C"" to Darcy,atleast he,s in every game he plays.  Kabby is back tonight,not sure if he will be over his shell shock. Time will tell.  Raycroft, well time to earn your wage.  If they dont make the play-offs,Im going with the young guns,yep the Pens. They can and do,have the ability to do what the Oilers did back against the Islanders."
50954,ccmtcanada,2007-03-23 19:38:00,7971,"This series with the Sabres is akin to the home and home losses to the Canadiens last year near the end of the season.  They did well after that for the final 12 or 13 games, but that Canadiens series was the turning point for sure.  They went with Aubin in net for the final games and he played amazing for us.  If they can win both games, they should make it....if they split, it'll be a nailbiter....if they lose both it's goodnight.  I've been a Leafs fan my whole life...even thru the crappy 80's....LOL.  GO LEAFS GO!!!"
50956,blaque,2007-03-23 19:42:00,2419,Never know which one of my sabres teams is gonna show up boys lol. Cant wait till they drop the puck though. I see a split comin.
50960,easton13th,2007-03-23 19:47:00,371,Toronto should have picked up Roberts at the deadline. I would like to see the Leafs in the playoff but that is going to be a strech.  I am a Montreal fan so I can be seen over the next two weeks bitting my nails...
50964,valerie,2007-03-23 19:54:00,83,I agree with you both i have also been a leaf fan all my life and i dont know how much more my heart can take. I just dont understand how they can get skunked by washington but can play a great game against new jersey.
50967,spanky,2007-03-23 19:59:00,195,"Raycroft could get the record for most wins in a season by a leafs goalie, not too shabby... Tucker, man sometimes i just wanna slap him around a bit for his loud european style of play (re: diving, embellishing and then whining and tantrum throwing), but Sundin, he's the man, gonna tie the record for most goals as a leafs tonight and break it tomorrow...  Hope Kabby is the same... and Wellwood has been looking kinda dodgy, like he's still in pain or something not the Welly from October... we shall see tho, but as a die hard Leafs fan, don't think they're gonna make it this year and JFJ will hopefully lose his job"
50990,xrap,2007-03-23 21:02:00,683,"Leafs have had alot of injuries this year, surprised to seem them still near a playoff spot. If we can atleast egt 2 pts out of the sabres tonight/ tommrow night then it should be a good fight till then end.     GO LEAFS GO"

51023,Corey,2007-03-23 22:59:00,355,"If Maple Leafs fans weren't such idiots, they would stop supporting a team that never wins until they get the right talent to win. The Leafs management are smart... why spend all the extra money on a winning team when your dumb-ass fans will always support a team they know will never win. duh."
51049,Rizzo,2007-03-23 23:54:00,4754,"If they can get some points out of tough games this week-end, hop right on that bandwagon (again).  Unfortunately, I'm thinking after this week-end more will be getting off than on."

51143,holdfast,2007-03-24 03:30:00,1813,"Sorry Boys, hate to sound like a broken record, No chance for any of our Canadian teams with European Captains winning the cup, It takes leadership.  They're minds are spending time back in their home countries instead of drinking from the Stanley Cup.  As far as Im concerned, there is no way that the leafs and Canadians deserve the Cup.  As far as Ottawa is concerned, Alfedson better step it out and get dirty otherwise, like his peers, he can watch the stanley cup in the land of the Volvo, ABBA.  By the way, like it or not statistics prove me right. One American, the rest are Canadian Captains that held the prize.  Bettman eat your heart out. Your dream will happen soon at the cost of our Canadian Tradition.  As far as Im concerned, Im getting ready to cheer on Pittsburg.  Mario has been more than outstanding for that club."
