51993,Steelcat,2007-03-26 16:27:00,191,"LOL~ Too bad ""Mythbusters"" didn't test this out while they were trying to bust the myth of other ways to beat the breathalyzer~! LOL"
51994,FinS,2007-03-26 16:29:00,463,lol
51997,Grimace,2007-03-26 16:31:00,2020,I have never had to eat the ass out of my shorts when i called a cab.   Cheers
52008,iceguy,2007-03-26 17:09:00,341,That guy in picture is 18 ouch! Drinking can age ya.

52072,grt1,2007-03-26 19:47:00,638,"Hey, you gotta remember, this guy is from Alberta, you know those farm boys, who knows what else they eat!!!"
52141,GbayGiant,2007-03-26 22:48:00,1780, Judging from the thick mustache and huge aviator glasses I would guess that's a picture of the cop. lol. standard police look.
52206,ch312,2007-03-27 03:16:00,1590,i had to do a breathalyzer when i got pulled over by an opp. drank 3 beers in 10-15 mins and got pulled over about 20-30 minutes later and blew 0  thought for sure it would have at least shown something.  the funniest thing ive heard for beating the breathalyzer is to drink alcohol asap before doing the test because it will overload the scanner....  if that is a pic of the guy that ate his underwear...i feel sorry for him. by the time he is 40 he will look like he is 150
52263,caper,2007-03-27 13:59:00,210, Then you will be doing the main breath test at the Police station after being arrested because it will show that you failed the roadside. Not so sure you want to go down that road..
52269,dustink,2007-03-27 14:22:00,526,"LOL...wow...  ""Fat, drunk, and stupid is no way to go through life son.""  Dean Wormer (Animal House)"
52451,Woodsman,2007-03-27 22:43:00,1286,"One of the funniest thing I ever scene in court was on the case before the case I was to testify on. A man was charged with refusing the breath test. Lawyer: Why did you refuse to give the breath test? Accused: Just before the officer inserted the tube into the breatherlizer ""I observered the officer picking his nose"". I wasn't blowing into that. Case dismissed if for nothing other than oridginallity."
52545,ch312,2007-03-28 01:37:00,1590, lol i know. i just found it amusing that this idiot actually thinks that. the sad part is he was serious...
52690,easton13th,2007-03-28 13:37:00,371,I was always told by my mother to wear clean shorts in case your in an accident BUT now I think it has other advantages.
52705,Garyv,2007-03-28 14:23:00,547,Geeze I wonder what his breath smelled like?
52721,verno,2007-03-28 15:06:00,178,Nuts
