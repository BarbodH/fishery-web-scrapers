51898,nelly,2007-03-26 12:29:00,256,The posters says there no limit on this lake and he catch THOUSANDS of crappie each year. Maybe it's me but I think it is morally wrong. Just how many crappie does this person need? Wondering if this person might be selling these a side or feeding the whole town.   http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wApOIe-Zv-4
51915,Steelcat,2007-03-26 13:41:00,191,"I've seen several people fish for Crappie and keep them as if they feed an army.  The worst I've seen was a guy with a Home Depot bucket filled with Crappie to the top, he stood beside the bucket and called his other friend from somewhere, wait till he arrived with yet another empty bucket then the 1st guy left.  After an hour or so the 2nd guy got his full bucket of Crappie, called the 1st guy with the now empty bucket.  The cycle continues until there's none for them to catch."

51930,OhioFisherman,2007-03-26 14:06:00,6623,"Dad and his buddies used to do that here, even started us out that way, made little or no sense to us kids. Every weekend in April they brought home bucket loads, gave them to neighbors, buried ones they didn`t clean and freeze. Just to impress?"

52045,Entropy,2007-03-26 18:38:00,747,What lake /  location does it look like?  (can't do the youtube thing right now)  Entropy
52142,steverowbotham,2007-03-26 23:12:00,1800,"crappie are taking over our lakes anyways, thats why there is no limit.  And with the amount of meat on them, you need a few dozen to feed a small family for one meal.  I've kept upwards of 80 crappies in a day from Simcoe, and fed my house for two nights."
52183,Fishmaster,2007-03-27 01:41:00,920,Ok how many people watched the weasle carton ..
52270,Puckhead,2007-03-27 14:22:00,377, Show me where and I'll help you!  PM me your spot(s) and it's a done deal  :).  Crappie are yummy...
52285,bigbuck,2007-03-27 15:05:00,2449,"If they're encroaching on the other fish in the lake then by all means, keep fishing till the car is packed to the gills (ha-ha!). Crappie are nice but I prefer a couple of nice walleye fillets any day. Up on Rice Lake for the closer last year a bunch of guys showed up on the Bewdley pier and started laying in on the crappie like they were going out of style, they kept absolutely everything they caught. Between the 6 or so of them while I was there until about 6:00, they must have caught upwards of a couple of hundred and were still going strong. I was tossing everything  back in and they were looking at me like I had one eye in the middle of my forehead, I dunno........some people can be really greedy and those are the ones that can mess up a good fishery."
