52489,Landlocked,2007-03-27 23:41:00,171,"Just looking for opinions on these two motors...I'm looking to upgrade the motor on my 16ft. Lund and have heard the newer four strokes won't ""rev down"" enough for proper trolling speed?!  Is that true for this size of motor and would the ETEC be a better option?  I see there is a 7yr warranty being offered on them if purchased by end of month. Thanks!"
52499,Pigeontroller,2007-03-28 00:03:00,2793,"Wow, a 7 year warranty is impressive! I have a Yamaha 90 hp 4 stroke on a 16 foot Lund. It will troll down to about 2.2 mph."
52501,Landlocked,2007-03-28 00:06:00,171,For sure..I'm just wondering if they are offering the 7 yr. warranty because you won't need it!
52526,Bernie,2007-03-28 01:00:00,3190,3 seasons on my 175 E-TEC and 200 hours. Changed spark plugs once and gear lube each season. Add gas and go. Thats it. Love it.
52527,Pigeontroller,2007-03-28 01:04:00,2793,"200 hours, gas and go, I'm assuming you added some oil?"
52533,Bernie,2007-03-28 01:12:00,3190,"O yes Pigeontroller, some oil too, but they dont use a lot of it. Because the fuel is injected above the piston it doesn't wash the oil below off. Consequently the oil required is greatly reduced. Last season I used about 8 liters."
52539,Pigeontroller,2007-03-28 01:22:00,2793,"Nip, i'm aware of how enviromentally friendly direct-injection 2 strokes are. I have heard the quality oil required can be costly though!"
52573,Bernie,2007-03-28 02:51:00,3190,Just use the Evinrude regular Etec oil through the summer. I put in the synthetic for October though. Gets kind of chilly some mornings. They recommend it for below freeze points. I ran a 130 Honda for 3 years before this one. Used synthetic engine oil in it so there wasnt much difference in total cost for the year between the two. The Evinrude makes up for that though..Its about 40% better on fuel than the Honda was.
52577,fishdawg,2007-03-28 02:59:00,912,"check & see what the max. transom weight is: 4 strokes are generally heavier then 2's, could influenece your decision - i know my Crest has a sticker that says ""engine weight not to exceed xxx lbs""  go 4 stroke man - you'll love it"

52659,Randy,2007-03-28 12:21:00,115,I just recently put on a new 50HP Etec on my 16' Princecraft and I'm itching to get it in the water.
52707,Bernie,2007-03-28 14:24:00,3190,You are going to love it Randy.
52709,PERCHER,2007-03-28 14:27:00,787,The Merc 4 strokes are made by Yamaha.I have 50hp 4 stroke Merc and luv it.It sips gas and low maintance.
52710,taper,2007-03-28 14:32:00,611,"I have a Yamaha and love it, but I almost went ETEC because of that wrranty. The new Mercs are not made by Yamaha. Yamaha made some components( I believe the power head) for Merc but that ended right after Mercury tried to sue Yamaha for undercutting the market."
