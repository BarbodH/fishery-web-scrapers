52428,buckster,2007-03-27 21:47:00,530,I have to transfer a boat into my name where would i go to get this done.
52430,lookinforwalleye,2007-03-27 21:55:00,4399,I always thought Canada Customs looked after this but I just looked at my boat registration and it is a Transport Canada document.
52431,Eddyk,2007-03-27 21:57:00,195,I beleive you have to go to MOT the same as a car.
52444,express168,2007-03-27 22:32:00,327,"Canada Customs does oversee the registration, if you call them they will tell you where the local centre is to do the registration."
52448,Mike the Pike,2007-03-27 22:39:00,3421,Here you Buckster  http://www.tc.gc.ca/MarineSafety/TP/Tp13414/menu.htm  MTP
52460,JFR,2007-03-27 22:57:00,498,  Here is the link to Service Canada's webpage dealing with ship registration:  http://www.tc.gc.ca/marinesafety/oep/shipr...ration/menu.htm
52463,Sherriff,2007-03-27 23:01:00,252,Mr J is correct.  Services Canada now does this and issues new boat numbers as well.  Sherriff
52466,irishfield,2007-03-27 23:10:00,26272,"Was Canada Customs service for free..then I heard it was changing over so you could go to any Social Security/Services Canada or something like that...but note that Temagami Marine no longer goes to North Bay and do them...they fax them into  Services Canada Pleasure Craft Licence Ctr. Fredericton, NB E3B 5G4  Fax number 506-462-5322  required..  Front of existing licence  Back of licence signed over to new owner and new owner has completed appropriate section  Complete an ""Application for Pleasure Craft Licence"".  Complete third party authorization letter... if you are doing it for someone else  Photocopy of both sides of your drivers licence  Bill of sale"
52467,express168,2007-03-27 23:12:00,327,"Sorry for the misinformation buckster, it must have changed from Canada Customs the last time I looked into it a couple of years back."
52468,Fisherman,2007-03-27 23:15:00,7201,And here's the link to the new Service Canada site for pleasure boat licencing:http://www.servicecanada.gc.ca/en/sc/boats/pleasurecraft.shtml
52472,buckster,2007-03-27 23:19:00,530,ok what about ownwership do boats have them  bit of a silly question
52483,irishfield,2007-03-27 23:31:00,26272,"If you read the link JR provided you will find that you can ""Register"" a vessel or get a ""licence"" for the vessel. Registering is an ""ownership"" and a licence is just that with your bill of sale required to prove you own it. I think I read pleasure craft fee was $100 if you want to register. Sounds right..cause the buggers nail us for $110 to do an airplane."
52671,didoban,2007-03-28 12:50:00,65,"and when you're boating, make sure you carry the registration with you...without the registration, a $300 fine...another grab!"
52752,irishfield,2007-03-28 16:31:00,26272,Was the only thing the OPP asked for when they pulled JR and myself over late last November. It's an easier way to make $300 than bothering with all the other stuff..since most don't even know where their Vessel Licence is. We never had one in our 26' Tempest for almost 20 years. Theft deterant isn't their excuse either...as they don't ask you for ID to show it's actually your boat....so I suggest putting your vessel licence in a less obvious place than your glove box so a thief might get ID'd for the fine writting at least..
