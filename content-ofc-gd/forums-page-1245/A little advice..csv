If ya know of a good place to go, or  some good advice to give me, it would be greatly appreciated.  Also, don't be afraid to talk to me like I'm 4 years old, because in regards to fishing, I might as well be.  So with that in mind, I'll leave you all to your busy days.  Thanks in advance.  John  PS  I need to purchase some new line for my rod.  Any recommendations?"

Take a drive along the lakeshore and do a bit of exploring. If trout are running you'll find people fishing there.  As for needing line on your reel, that really depends on what type of reel you have and what line it is rated for. I always try to go with the lightest line I can get away with for any given situation but that is a personal choice. If you have a spinning reel it will usually give you three line weights and capacities. A good choice would be the mid range  as a starting point."
