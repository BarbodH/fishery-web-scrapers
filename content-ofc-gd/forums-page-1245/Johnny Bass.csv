His winter hybernation should be complete and his reprots should start to come in. Anyone know what's up with Johnny B? His spring arrival is like a ritual! HH"

52427,Cookslav,2007-03-27 21:43:00,1457,Soon enough he'll drop in. He's out of season right now anyway.... Another month or so he'll be in here shooting the breeze... Especially with all the election talk for June
