52150,BillyBarilko,2007-03-27 00:03:00,28,"Is there any spring time action out of Victoria Harbour for Trout/Salmon?  I know the Sturgeon has a small run of bows, but is it worth trolling out in the bay? How far out do I have to go to get Salmon/trout?  How about the summer time, is there any action out past Giants Tomb?  I've never really fished out in the open waters of Georgian Bay, just mostly around Honey Harbour for pike/musky, bass and the odd pickerel during lazy days of summer.   thanks, Bull."
