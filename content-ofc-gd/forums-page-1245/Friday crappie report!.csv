51639,Mr Twister,2007-03-25 18:28:00,71,Made it out on friday for a last go at some crappie fishing on the Ottawa river system.What a great day with good company for the afternoon Trent showed up till dark with me!Managed to take home a few for the table and let lots go for another day.The ice is still very thick but caution is to be had made to shore.Looking forward to some open water fishing soon
