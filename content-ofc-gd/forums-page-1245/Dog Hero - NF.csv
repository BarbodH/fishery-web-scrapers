Pretty cool story! http://www.citynews.ca/news/news_9211.aspx  Dog Saves Woman's Life With Heimlich Maneuver Wednesday March 28, 2007How smart is your dog?  However clever your four legged friend may be, your pet likely can't hold a candle to a two year-old golden retriever named Toby.  He lives with a woman named Debbie Parkhurt in the small town of Vert, Maryland. And what he did last week simply defies explanation.  The 45-year-old owner was alone in her home eating an Apple on Friday when a piece of the fruit got lodged in her throat. She began to choke and tried to perform the Heimlich maneuver on herself.  It didn't work.  She then began beating on her chest in an attempt  to dislodge the obstruction, but that failed, too.  The jewelry designer was in danger of choking to death and didn't know how she'd get help in time.  That's when her 'wunderdog' went to work.  Toby suddenly came up to Parkhurst, got up on his hind legs, put his paws on her shoulders, pushed her to the ground and began jumping up and down on her chest.  Incredibly, his efforts succeeded and the apple bit came out of the relieved woman's mouth, allowing her to breathe again.  Most people aren't trained in the Heimlich procedure and Parkhurst has no idea how her dog knew what to do.  ""I literally have pawprint-shaped bruises on my chest,"" she told her local paper. ""I'm still a little hoarse, but otherwise, I'm OK.  ""The doctor said I probably wouldn't be here without Toby. I keep looking at him and saying 'You're amazing.'""  After his effort was over, Toby kept kissing his owner to make sure she didn't fall back into an unconscious state, allowing her to get up and call for help.  It seems this pet went from Heimlich to dog lick. And it's one trick her amazed owner hopes he never has to repeat."
