Computer Stuff The computer and internet help area run by Gerritt and Corey has become more popular than anyone thought it would and is a great place to get all the info you may need. Corey is a dedicated PC guy and Gerritt is our resident Mac Man. If you need computer help see them here.  Games Many of you liked the point and click styled games we were all trying a few weeks back. For a complete list of hi quality, online games of that style, try Casual Gameplay.  Image and Picture Control Lots of members are always asking questions about image editing, organizing and resizing. THere's several free applications that can do this for you. From Google there is Picasa2, there's also Irfan View, and for more advanced edits there is Gimp and it's Photoshop clone, GimpShop.  Add-ons For Firefox  If you like Firefox, then here's a few add-ons you shouldn't be without. If you are trying to make a web page, then Web Developer is for you. It allows you to view how pages are made by seeing the relationship between the page and its code, its CSS and the table elements. I have learned alot with this tool and it is absolutely a must-have for trouble-shooting a web page error. Need to kill some time? Sure even this site can't fill up all your web browsing time. If you are looking for sites about a particular subject you can use Google, but it only gets you sites that index well, not necessarily sites that are relevant and useful. StumbleUpon can not only find you sites you will like, but it only takes you to sites that are recommended and with the info you are looking for. Simply add the extension then register to program your favourite type of websites. Click the Stumble button and away you go. Need a quick peek at the weather for your area? Try Forecast Fox. Like to listen to music while you surf? FoxyTunes is awesome.  Fishing Stuff  Find your new FMZ at the MNR website. Enter your fish in the OFAH online tourney and get bonus points for your team in the OFC tourney. Renew your fishing license online! Get your renewal instantly. Sponsor of the Week  This weeks  pick is Fishing World. A huge selection of fishing tackle and equipment. Just off Centennial Parkway about 10 minutes from the QEW."
