52423,Minnow,2007-03-27 21:35:00,177,Hey Guys  Was wondering if the sucker have started their run up the holland river? I usually fish around the dam near Newmarket. Not really my favourite fish to catch but not much else to do and it is so close to my house thought might as well get out wed or thurs for some early spring sucker. So does anyone know if there will be any fish or is too early? Also was wondering when the channel cat run will start in dunnville?
52425,Terry,2007-03-27 21:40:00,14456,I would think it's a little early for the suckers...
52426,xrap,2007-03-27 21:42:00,683,"Not sure but if your looking for big kitties at Dunnville you should pm fishmaster, he'll hook you up with some bait and give you some tips."
52429,Minnow,2007-03-27 21:51:00,177,Last year I went up in the first weeks of april and got about 15 suckers so they were already there just wondering if there are even a few suckers in the river or is it still too early? Thanks for the tip xrap
52433,Terry,2007-03-27 21:58:00,14456,"if we get a good hard rain, the run  will be on but I think we need the river flowing  and the ice in the river gone"
52481,pikeie,2007-03-27 23:27:00,380,"lol i was just going to post somthing similar. there is a creek by my house that has the suckes running up it in huge numbers but whatever i do i cant hook one, all i get are the creek chubs (great dead bait for witer pike) ive tried bottom fishing, ive tried float fishing. ive used worms, and corn. any idea what im doing wrong??"
52488,troutologist,2007-03-27 23:41:00,951,"I wish I had your luck I can catch suckers at the drop of a hat. its uncanny. Icefishing for specks...suckers. Trolling for specks...suckers. Trolling for lakers with a rapala...suckers.  I digress, Ive found suckers start to run heavy a week or so after the bows are up in numbers."
52500,aplumma,2007-03-28 00:03:00,6896,"well if you hurry you can be the first sucker their. Sorry just could not resist I havent ever fished for sucker but I don't know their patterns yet. Keep us posted when you get a few ""Suckers"" in the same place.  Art"
52597,Fishmaster,2007-03-28 03:43:00,920,The Suckers are running thick right now at the Dunnville Dam the Cats won't be far behind another week or so i will start fishing for the Big Blue Cats ...i seen a guy dip netting Sucker today had a bucket full ..
52689,Headhunter,2007-03-28 13:35:00,5703,I thought this thread was going to be about the Leafs! HH
52711,ccmtcanada,2007-03-28 14:35:00,7971, LOL...hey wait...I'm a Leafs Fan....  Nice one HH.
52764,Marko,2007-03-28 17:30:00,854,"Worm and a sinker, thats how you should be able to catch them in big numbers."
52802,The Urban Fisherman,2007-03-28 19:39:00,2050,"I'm not sure about that area, but the past three years going to school in london I was always able to get into the redhorse suckers by the end of march/beginning of april.  I'm going to try for pike this weekend, and switch to suckers if the pike action isn't happenin'!  Good Luck dude!  UF"
52815,mattyk,2007-03-28 20:08:00,2110,like marko said worms and sinker should get you in business.
