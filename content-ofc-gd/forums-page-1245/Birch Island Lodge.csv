I use to be on this board but had computer problems and server problems and on top of that I forgot my username and password.  That is what happens when you get old.  I have been coming up to Ontario for over 30 years and have enjoyed every trip.  I have fished from the Niagara River to the Albany River.  I have meet a lot of nice people, especialy in the Fall at Owen Sound, but have not made it back there for the past couple of years.  West Virginia is Wild and Wonderful but Ontario is Heaven.  After 30 years of doing our own cooking and eveything, I am getting old or lazy.  We are looking at Birch Island Lodge in the North Channel.  The Lodge sounds very good from the fishing to the meals.  Never had maid service when I have been fishing, but want to check it out.  I would appreciate it if any of you have any information on the fishing or the quality service Birch Island Lodge has.  Cannot believe they have bass, walleye, muskie, and trout in the same area.  Bob"

It was completely boarded up, and obviosuly shut down for the season. The cottages look ok, worn down from the winter i am assuming. There were about 15 cottages and a main lodge. Im sorry i cant tell you about the accomodatons becasue ive never actually stayed at the lodge but I do know they have some nice big safe looking aluminum hauls for the sometimes unpredictable waters of georgian bay."
