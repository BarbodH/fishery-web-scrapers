51342,HUKDONFAWNIX,2007-03-24 21:46:00,135,"Hey everyone,  I'm getting very anxious waiting for the first weekend in May.  So I'm thinking about heading to BPS and Lebaron to pick up some new lures for my Pike adventures.  I have the basics covered.......Red/white Williams wobbler, Half gold/half silver hammered williams wobbler, Yellow five of diamonds, White spinnerbait, perch x-rap etc.  I'm sure most of you can relate to my feeling that I can always use more lures!  SO my question is.........Can you suggest a few other lures/colours that are effective for Pike?  Thanks in advance!"

51346,express168,2007-03-24 22:05:00,327,Large buck tail spinners have worked well for me as well
51354,OhioFisherman,2007-03-24 22:20:00,6623,"Johnson silver minnow with a pork trailer, like mentioned large spinners, mepps have worked for me, caught a lot on 7 inch f18 rapalas perch, silver, rattle traps like mentioned chrome with a black back for me, any bass bait will work, hooked them on plastic worms and jig and pigs. safety pin style spinner baits. Zara spooks, hula poppers, flatfish. List is long, just have to see what they prefer on a given day."
51358,GbayGiant,2007-03-24 22:29:00,1780,"Get something you can put in there face.  honestly I think they eat anything that gets in their way, from walleye jigs to musky spinners.  Large spoons, spinners,bucktails, and 1/2 jiggs with large rubber worms or shads are all top choices for me, I've also caught many with suicks the 9"" and a 6"" suick is deadly in the spring.  Oh, and you might want to pick up some quick-strike rigs and bobbers if you like live or dead bait fishing."
51361,trapshooter,2007-03-24 22:46:00,1234,"One of my fav. early season pike baits is a large, 7"" or so, sluggo type plastic bait.  They can save your day if the pike are being picky."
51373,taper,2007-03-24 23:24:00,611,Large bucktails and an original red devil as well as an assortment of spoons in different shapes and colours.
51382,FinS,2007-03-24 23:53:00,463,"anything silver,lots of vibration something with rattles i personally like the 6"" smithwick rogue"
51384,Rich Clemens,2007-03-25 00:04:00,3131,Had some good luck on larger spinner baits and a big old Lucky-Strike Spoons.  Always try top have a couple of the Lucky Stikes with me.
51386,Daplumma,2007-03-25 00:10:00,1961,If I could only pick one it would be a firetiger husky jerk.I dont get up there for early season pike but have done well from Late June until late Aug. with this lure. Joe

51408,ryanheritage,2007-03-25 01:23:00,180,"Here's a cheapie lure that has produced very, very well for me. Blue fox spoons. I have had great sucess with them, they seem to work well for me. And they are real cheap!!!"

51480,Northhunter,2007-03-25 09:08:00,214,"Bottom line is sometimes they'll hit anything. Generally stuff that's moving and half their length or less is the normal food, but even that doesn't always apply  But for quicker moving baits I've always done well with things in green/chartreuse/firetiger. A yellow/green Little Cleo is good - heavy bait that casts far and can be fished fast or slow, shallow or deep deep. Has a proven action and throws good vibes (""thumps"" the water).  Slower moving baits and I go with more natural colours. Add another vote for the suspending Husky Jerk. Blue/silver with an orange belly is good when they look at the bait a little longer or hit on the pause. Perch is good too... can't go wrong with a perch pattern."
51483,Big Cliff,2007-03-25 10:17:00,6899,"You have just about every one of my favorite standbys. From there, the trick is presentation. One thing I like to do when fishing pike is troll in the wake about a foot below the surface or, back the boat up to a weed bed crack the throttle throwing prop wash back into the weeds then cast back along the weed edge. You'll piss off any big pike hiding in there and they'll hit almost anything they see."
51522,Bing,2007-03-25 13:20:00,33,"Last year I was in the McKellar, Ontario area and bought a polish something pike lure, I couldn't believe I how big this lure was and how much it looked like a real pike and I caught pike about the same size as the lure. Can't wait to try it out again this year. Bing"
