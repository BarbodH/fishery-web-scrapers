52116,BFSC Kevin,2007-03-26 21:40:00,1351,sorry. but just wondering how much a mid 80s 5hp honda is worth and a late 80s 8hp honda is worth? of course 4 stroke. any particular comments on them? thanks
52117,grt1,2007-03-26 21:53:00,638,One of my fishing buddies sold his Honda 10hp (an older blue colored version) for $400 and thought he got a good deal so I would suggest if you pay over $500 for these it is a BAD deal
52118,BFSC Kevin,2007-03-26 21:56:00,1351,really? a 80s 4stroke not even worth 500? its already hard enough for me to find a 2 stroke 80's+ for 500...
52122,Bernie,2007-03-26 22:05:00,3190,"At that age I would look at what kind of condition it was in. If properly maintained and low hours it would be worth the $500 bucks. If not maintained and beat up it is worth nothing. A quick visual check-starter rope,is it badly worn? The engine itself- oil coated and dirty or nice and clean? Is the throttle and tiller handle nice and smooth or loose as a goose? The shift lever move easily? ( sometimes you need to turn the prop by hand to align the gears) Ask the seller if you can take it to a reputable mechanic to give it a quick checkover. If he refuses -dont buy it. If he accepts, a few bucks checking it out may save you some money. Just a few things off the top of my head here but you should get the idea."

52172,BFSC Kevin,2007-03-27 01:24:00,1351,some of those don't look too right.. a 1985  for only $65...
52215,POLLIWOGG,2007-03-27 04:21:00,835,Hmmm  Check out the price on Irish's bird.
52222,pikehunter,2007-03-27 10:47:00,1659,Those prices do look low. Maybe that is a sight the insurance companies use to judge a boats value when they have to pay off a claim!
52223,Terry,2007-03-27 10:50:00,14456,"I have not seen a 5 hp Honda for under $600, they always seem to hold their value wish I could find a 10hp for $400"
52226,Bob,2007-03-27 11:21:00,370,"As with any market, it's a supply / demand issue.  Most people selling something used insist the item is worth more than it really is and those looking to purchase insist it's worth less.  That being said, I personally wouldn't pay more than $500 for a 20+ year old outboard in the 10 hp or lower category.  On the other hand, if someone was offering one for less than $100, I'd be highly suspicious of condition.  Today, I know where to lay hands on an 88 Buick, certified, for $1000.  Look around and you'll find deals."
52247,Mike the Pike,2007-03-27 12:35:00,3421,Kevin I sold my 1980 Honda 7.5hp for $650.00 3 yrs ago it ran like new.  Not to long ago you were talking about picking up a 9.9hp and now you are looking at 5hp.  Spend a bit more money and find a 9.9hp.  5hp on a 12 foot tinny will go very slow.  I run an 8hp on my 12 foot tinny and I would still prefer a 9.9.The Maximum horsepower allowed.  Go bigger its better.  MTP
52260,LeXXington,2007-03-27 13:45:00,1928,Not too steal the thread by any means but watch out for lots of older engines going on Sale soon. With the new gas regs in Ontario 10% eth could eat away at some older seals making them need replaceing sooner.  I would not pay $500 for a 80's engine under 9.9..  consider getting one used from the USA lots to get and much cheaper
52301,POLLIWOGG,2007-03-27 15:30:00,835,Theres a big difference in the 5hp and the 8hp as your going from a single to a twin. there are some outboards out there that are used on rag haulers and have very low hrs on them and have more resale value.  I paid 800 for a    8 hp yami  2 st.  because it only had a half lt of oil through it and it was clean as brand new. It was used to take a small sailboat in and out of the harbor for a few years.
52424,salpro,2007-03-27 21:40:00,7,"Hey kev!  I got a shock at the Toronto show few weeks back.  I have a 1956 (mint) 5 1/2 seahorse.  Run's amasing.  I asked the dealers what ist worth?  $100.00  if u r lucky u may get upwards to $300.00.... I told him he was nuts, but thats how it is.   If i sold it for 500.00 I would never get a kicker, any yr,that runs that good to replace it.   So hold on, use it....Only way to get a fair buck out of it.  Its a shame, but i'm going to run mine till it puks.  Should be in a collection somewhere.   Sal"
