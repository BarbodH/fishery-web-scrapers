As the trip was a long and quiet one, he stopped the car and asked the Cree man if he would like a ride. With a silent nod of thanks, the man got into the car. Resuming the journey, Sam tried in vain to make a bit of small talk with the Cree man.  The old man just sat silently, looking intently at everything he saw, studying every little detail, until he noticed a box on the seat next to Sam.  ""What in box?"" asked the old man.  Sam looked down at the box and said, ""It's a case of beer.  I got it for my wife.""  The Cree man was silent for another moment or two.  Then speaking with the quiet wisdom of an elder, he said, ""GOOD TRADE."""
