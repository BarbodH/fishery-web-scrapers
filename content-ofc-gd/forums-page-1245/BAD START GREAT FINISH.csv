52482,spoonman,2007-03-27 23:28:00,103,That a boy Scotty 6-11 that is a great day on the river. Nice pics
52502,young_one,2007-03-28 00:06:00,620,"I knew today would've been an excellent day to start early on this week's fantastic weather. I'm so jealous that you don't have to work, mind if I ask what you do for living? I remember something related to electricity repair or something, :S I could be wrong. Hmm if you continue feeding these pics online, soon enough I'll skip school to go fish  Screw Grd12, who needs a future when you can catch Steelhead all day.  Joking... but I am considering going early to the river when I have double morning preparatory period/spare. My copy of Jim Butler is on its way, soon enough Iâ€™ll have my Steelhead 101 guide."
52510,canadian_copper,2007-03-28 00:20:00,925,IM A HEAVY EQUIPMENT OPERATOR!!! 6MONTHS WORK 6MONTHS FISH  LOL READ THE BOOK WELL BRO!!! JIM BUTLER WAS ONE OF MY MENTORS AND I LEARNED SO MUCH FROM HIM!!! TX AGAIN ALL
