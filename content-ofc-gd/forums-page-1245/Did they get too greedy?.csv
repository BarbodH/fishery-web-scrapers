52664,easton13th,2007-03-28 12:37:00,371,It's a start to control the population of the great lakes. I hope the Americans are on board with this as well.
52693,OhioFisherman,2007-03-28 13:38:00,6623,"As far as I know Ohio doesn`t allow commercial fishing for walleye, they bought the licenses back in the 70`s? Just my point of view is there is enough pressure on the Great Lakes with sport fishermen. Everyone complains about poachers? when those guys do it they excede by thousands of pounds."
52703,lilkynan,2007-03-28 14:05:00,173,did you know that 99% of all Walleye and Perch caught commercially in Lake E is shipped to Japan!!!! -
52712,taper,2007-03-28 14:38:00,611,"My understanding is that the quotas were hammered out in a meeting of 7 US states,Ontario and Quebec as well as both federal governments, this is the result. They also said it is following the spawn patterns to try to keep a viable amount of fish for future spawns. It said in the paper that the walleye spawn on Erie is on a 3 year cycle."
