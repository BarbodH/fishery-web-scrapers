49157,bigbuck,2007-03-19 16:33:00,2449,"Either or. They are both fantastic reels. I picked up a Stradic in January and will probably ene up picking up an Energy Pti sometime during the spring/summer. I have Shimano, Quantum, and Abu reels and don't have anything bad to say about any of them. Get what you like better. Unless you fish every day and/or are really hard on your gear, you should not have any problems with either."
49228,spanky,2007-03-19 18:40:00,195," That's a huge reel Photoz, carping i guess? My local shop has 1 in stock and he showed it to me yesterday and i was totally taken back by it's sheer size.... that's when i picked up my Stradic 2500 and compared the 2, looks good for surf and carp fishing tho!!  I personally don't like quantum spinning reels, seem to be alot heavier then shimano and Daiwa... love the baitcasters tho!! So who knows, their upper lines might be lighter (makeslonger days easier for me)"
49235,mdej,2007-03-19 18:52:00,98,I have the Stradic 2500 and the only thing I don't like is the handle.  I prefer the thumb type grip or handle over the bar type (power handle).  Seems to me that the 2500 having a power handle is a little too much.  More comfortable for me all day using the more thumb grip type handle.
49236,douG,2007-03-19 18:54:00,2693,Daiwa for spinning reels.
49242,Headhunter,2007-03-19 19:02:00,5703,"I'm a Quantum guy! I really like the feel of the reel, the sensitivity of the drag etc.. . I've only ever had one Shimano, I don't recall the model, it was years ago. I ended up throwing it in the garbage as the drag system kept loosening on it's own and one day, the spool flew off on a cast! That was it for me! Been buying Quantums' ever since! I have a Penn spinning reel, but it's pretty heavy. I still have a number of old Mitchells that still work well, but If I was to buy another reel, it would be a Quantum! HH"
49252,tonyb,2007-03-19 19:31:00,1637,Daiwa over Shimano over Quantum
49266,douG,2007-03-19 19:58:00,2693,"Exactly, Tony."
49271,urbanangler1990,2007-03-19 20:04:00,933,"difference right off the bat is the bail on the energy is nearly indestructable (or is it undes..) bail is made of nickel titanium only 1 of that kind, u can twist it, step on it, lol,  that reel can take more punishment than the stradic by far, whatever u chose is an awsome choice!"
49284,David Chong,2007-03-19 20:21:00,836,"The Stradic & Energy are both good reels. I've own & used them all at some point! Daiwa as far as I'm concerned makes the best spinning reels. Do yourself a favour and have a look at the new Daiwa Tierra! They sell for around $129.99 mark phenomenal reel! Unbelievable for the $$$ Eight bearings including CRBB's, Digigear design, Air Bail, Sealed water-proof drag system & Twist-Buster line twist reduction. It also includes a spare aluminum spool! BTW, nobody makes a better drag system than Daiwa! My 2 cents, Dave "
49431,bucktail,2007-03-20 01:34:00,1857,Daiwa Tierra!   I feel like a princess already!!!!
49767,Guest Johnny Bass,2007-03-20 21:36:00,0,"First off, I'd have to say that Diawa makes the best reels by far. Though it depends on what your going to use it for. Most Diawa reels have low gear ratios. I've noticed when the fish bite is slow. Low gear reels produce more fish.  The Quantum energy is also a decent reel with an average gear ratio. The Stradic has a higher gear ratio and is better for fishing with plastics, tubes, ect.. Its great in situations where you have to pick up alot of slack line fast.  Basically, slow gear ratio gears are better for all around fishing IMO, but for a specific type of application as I mentioned above,the stradic is better.  As far as service? As was mentioned above, Shimano is tops and is local. Diawa? If your reels get damaged? Prepare for long wait times or for expensive replacement parts."
49781,charlesn,2007-03-20 22:05:00,551,"The Stradic is a very nice reel.  But for less money, and not much performance difference, the Symmetre is a great reel.  Last year I went with Symmetres, because I needed 6 and couldn't afford/justify Stradics.  I still own some Stradics, but the Symmetres to me felt just as solid, just as smooth and for the purposes of what I did, totally satisfied my needs.  When I need more I will be getting more Symmetres.  The green goes better with my boat anyways.  I don't think any reel maker nowadays can afford to market junk.  One reel I'd love to see in action is the Doug Hannon WaveCast spinning reel.  Seems pretty novel idea and spool design and if it does what they claim (eliminates the twisted line mess that happens at times with spinning reels along with longer casts) then it is well worth giving a try.  Charles"

50392,Minnow,2007-03-22 05:23:00,177,"First of all Thank you guys so much for all the feedback by far best fishing site on the internet and it great to be a part of this community, so much info i read every post and was a very hard choice to make but went with the quantum energy pti, I still am tempted to return it for the shimano but I have so many shimano reels and my dad just got the magnesium stradic so i decided to try something new. I also got the quantum energy pti baitcaster last year and loved it, my other two baitcaster's are shimano the castaic, and the curado both amazing reels no complaints. So decided to try out their spinning reel even though I am still a shimano kind of guy. BTW I have never really known about diawa reels and did some research and they have some high quality reels, thanks David Chong for the insider info! Only problem is the only place that carries them is BPS in the states and I will probably order one online this summer, unless someone can tell me where I can get one here in Canada. I will test out the quantum and let you guys know how it does.  Thanks again everyone for all the help!  Tight Lines Kirill aka Minnow"
50439,Viscount,2007-03-22 13:26:00,52,"Looks like I got to this thread too late! But here's my 2 cents anyways  I'll never buy a reel that isnt a shimano. I broke the anti-reverse out of a diawa baitcaster many moons ago. called california and they said they didnt have a parts department, they'd transfer me to SALES!!!! haha It would appear from previous posts that they do indeed have a parts department now. that's good. Other reels may be better choices for certain types of fishing. i'm not knocking the Quantum, i've never even seen a picture of one. But I am so impressed with the customer service at shimano, they've won me over forever. Anyone's reel could outlast your fishing days, but personally I feel better knowing that shimano has my back if anything goes wrong.  Keep us up to date on that quantum...."
50560,David Chong,2007-03-22 17:38:00,836,"Hi Minnow, Daiwa are available thru BPS & Cabela's down in the States but I find with most reels that you are better off buying up here! They are available at BPS-Vaughan, LeBaron's, JB's Fishing Depot, Rock'n Reel etc. No one can argue with Shimano's service, it is definitely top-notch. Daiwa is working on it's repair issues hopefully there will be an annoucement soon! Cheers, Dave"
52741,98Fahrenheit,2007-03-28 15:52:00,108,Stradic ONLY.  I have the Stradic MgF2500 .... Japanese Domestic Model.  It's awesome!  Love the drag!
48394,Minnow,2007-03-17 19:30:00,177,"Hey guys  Went down to Bass Pro yesterday to take a look at the sale and decided to purchase a new spinning reel today. Will probably go tommorow to pick one up. Narrowed it down to the Shimano Stradic 2500 and the Quantum Energy 20 Can't decide which one to go with, both are exactly the same price and have very similar features. Guys please help me out if anyone you own either reel or have heard complaints or praise about one of them let me know! Which one should I go with?  Thanks"
48400,danbo,2007-03-17 19:50:00,2646,Save $$   Daiwa Exceler is my current fave!
48402,Crazyhook,2007-03-17 19:56:00,1154,stradic is an awesome reel!
48404,TennesseeGuy,2007-03-17 19:59:00,957,"I have two Stradic 2500, Extreme 6' M combos and they're great for walleyes.  They don't mind pulling in a nice pike every once in a while."
48407,Burtess,2007-03-17 20:14:00,901,Between those two I would take the Stradic.  But......  Have you looked at the Team Daiwa Advantage line?  I have the TDA-2500 and it's an excellent reel.  Same price range as the others you've mentioned.  Its definetaly worth a look...  Burt
48408,ccmtcanada,2007-03-17 20:25:00,7971,Just get both!!!
48426,lew,2007-03-17 21:17:00,12767,"Given the choice, I'd always take Shimano."
48430,Mike the Pike,2007-03-17 21:20:00,3421,Go for the Stradic it is the best spinning reel I own.
48461,hawg_hauler,2007-03-17 22:24:00,69,"Stradic, hands down. You won't be disappointed."
48498,silveradosheriff,2007-03-17 23:23:00,1025,I'm very happy with my Stradic - I second hawg hauler.
48509,musky66,2007-03-17 23:41:00,273,"I am a Shimano guy, but last season I picked a Quantum Energy over a Stradic and it is a better reel IMO."
48515,danc,2007-03-17 23:51:00,4677,Nobody has said why one reel is any better than the other. And that's my point.  Reels have come so far that it is difficult to choose these days. I needed a cheap spare reel last summer for a friend to use so I picked up a $39.00 shimano at Walmart. It's an awesome reel. Don't get me wrong. I use much more expensive reels. I'm not sure why after trying out the Walmart reel. Personally I use Cabelas  spinning reels exclusively. I like the price. I like the quality. And I like the Cabelas guarantee. I'll be ordering a Cabelas Prodigy soon. Check it out.
48524,Mike the Pike,2007-03-18 00:01:00,3421, Ok I don't know much about the other reel from Quantum but I do love my Stradic.I have alot of Shimano reels and have had 4 Quantums.2 of my Quantums died last year no more good don't work anymore so Like Lew says he likes Shimano products and I think there built to last because I have not had one fail me yet.I have nothing bad to say about my Quantum bait casters.For me spinning reels for now on I am going to stick to Shimano.  MTP
48526,Slowhand,2007-03-18 00:05:00,13,"Ultimately, you should go with what you're comfortable with. Both the reels you mention are good. In fact most middle range reels are pretty good these days. I have a number of spinning reels made by different manufacturers. Penn, Daiwa, Abu (old C4) and Shimano. My Stella 2500 is my best spinning reel. But I also like using my Penn Z714 Ultra Sport. Why is the Stella better than the Penn?: Tighter tolerances, smoother, great styling, more bearings, etc. Does that mean my Penn is no good? Not to me. It all depends on what you are measuring: Price, quality, engineering, Reliability, personal comfort with the reel? Me? I probably would buy the Stradic. But then again I also bought a Sahara. And on it goes (like this post of mine)"
48556,mattyk,2007-03-18 02:03:00,2110,shimano!
48557,Zib,2007-03-18 02:08:00,369,I like my Quantum Energy 20 a lot better than my Shimano Stradic. The drag is so much better on the Quantum plus it's smoother. I was always a Shimano fan until I bought that Quantum.
48558,bucktail,2007-03-18 02:08:00,1857,I have found the shimano's built to last better then other reels. The Symetry is probably the best bang for the buck.....I have 5!
48632,Photoz,2007-03-18 09:09:00,792,"I have several Stradics, 2000 & 4000 . . . .    and about to pick up a 6000 . . .   because the ones I have have done so well, I didn't even consider anything else. A few years ago I had some Fireline cut grooves in the bale, where the line goes on the spool . . .     dropped into Aikmans, they didn't even ask for a receipt, just fixed it on warranty. If anything goes seriously wrong, Shimano's main parts depot is in Peterborough . .  where do the parts from OTHER manufacturers have to come from? I like Daiwa too . . .    but after calling Aikman's about parts availability, I was cautioned there was NOT ONE PLACE IN CANADA for parts (3 years ago) and the closest place was California, I stuck with Shimano!"
48656,hawg_hauler,2007-03-18 12:16:00,69,"Years have gone by and I have gone through Quantum's, Abu's, Shimano's and even Zebco. The only Product that has survived is Shimano. I still have my original Curado from 10 to 12 years ago (used mainly Quantum up till then and replaced them about every two to three years) and it works as good as it did when I bought it. I am all Shimano now, (5 Curados, 2 Chronarchs, 2 Stradics, 1 Castiac and 1 Citica) why would I go to anything else. ""If it ain't broke, don't fix it""  This is my 100% biased opinion."
48744,mepps,2007-03-18 17:31:00,1301,"I havent had good experince with Shimano spinning reels, never used the stardic though.  I have the Quantum PTi and it is easily the best quality spinning reel I have ever used.  Going into my thrid season with it and it has been used mostly for bass, walleye and pike."
48843,Fishmaster,2007-03-18 21:46:00,920,I like my PTI both bullet proof reels

48849,lickmyarmpit,2007-03-18 21:54:00,359,I've got a pti quantum and a symetre both bought the same season I use the quantum more but its the symetre thats more beat up dunno if im just rougher on it but my vote goes to the quantum.
48877,Bernie,2007-03-18 22:52:00,3190,Two years ago ran into a friend working the fishing show. He advocated the quantum as a great reel. I bought one. Used it for a month just to give it a fair shake. It now sits on a shelf unused as a spare. Back to Shimano. Guess in the last couple years improvements may have been made but I am happy with what I'm using now.
49002,holdfast,2007-03-19 04:04:00,1813,"When I was in Edmonton a couple of years ago I deeked into the REEL DR (a popular fishing reel repair centre) and asked the repair man a few questions about reels.  He stated that he found that the most reliable reel was a Quantum Energy.  Also a reel that he had the fewest repairs.  He also told me that more bearings doesn't necessarily give you better quality.  Personally I never used a quantum, But my Shimanoo spirex and symetry have never let me down.  I love the Idea that they don't use any springs on their trigger bail."
