479394,10point,2010-06-25 13:56:00,165,So we are coming up to the Temagami area this weekend and staying for a week. Weather not looking oso hot for Monday and Tuesday with lows around 5 and highs around 13. I assume this might effect the bite some. Any species of fish that we should concentrate during the cooler days?
