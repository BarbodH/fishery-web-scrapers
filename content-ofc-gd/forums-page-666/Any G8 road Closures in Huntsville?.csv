479189,Kingsalmon,2010-06-24 21:43:00,107,Heard ramblings from two of my friends that hwy 11 will be closed this weekend in Hunstville.  Any truth to this?   I have looked and looked and the only thing I see is that Hwy 60 will be closed in sections around Deerhurst.  Leaving fro Nipissing tomorrow and don't want to get stuck somewhere.  THanks.
