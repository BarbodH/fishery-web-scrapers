478731,bassjnkie,2010-06-23 20:10:00,1101,Does anyone know a place/person that can tune up a cb radio? I already called Radioworld and Queensway is gone. Thanks in advance.
478755,Burtess,2010-06-23 21:24:00,901,"Do you mean to match to an antenna or are you looking for a boot (linear amplifier)? You can easily match yourself with a cheap swr meter... Linear amps are illegal so doubtful you will get a response for this...  Most truck stops will have a CB shop, you could check one of those out.  Burt"
478762,bassjnkie,2010-06-23 21:39:00,1101,"It's matched with the meter, I'm not looking for an amp. I want it peaked and tuned to the LEGAL 4watts. I should have mentioned that, sorry, thanks."
478764,Terry,2010-06-23 21:46:00,14456,you can try this place...10/4  http://www.durhamradio.com/

478815,Fisherman,2010-06-24 00:21:00,7201,"Give radioworld a call, just down the road from you www.radioworld.ca"
478819,Terry,2010-06-24 00:27:00,14456,didn't his first post say he tried radioworld
478837,Fisherman,2010-06-24 01:16:00,7201,"okay, okay, ya got me on that one, but I'm keeping a eye on ya."
479329,irishfield,2010-06-25 04:42:00,26272,4 watts is for wussies !! Right Terry... lol
479346,Terry,2010-06-25 09:21:00,14456,you got that right...LOL
479351,Handlebarz,2010-06-25 10:23:00,3790,"Dang 4 watts I guess that's why so many truck drivers are running 5 trucks deep and 6"" apart and all this time I just thought they were afraid to get lost.  Most places charge around $25 for peek and tune I dont know what are good places here in Ontario as alot of us get our work done in Ohio they have some good shops down there hope that guy works out for you."
479396,dave524,2010-06-25 14:00:00,4508,"   HMMMM! bells and whistles going off in my head, Terry, you didn't perhaps run a salmon charter operation on Lake Ontario back in the eighties, 40 foot Post Sportfish and later a 46 footer. The CB talk and the pics in your avatar say we may have crossed paths for a while ?"
479428,Terry,2010-06-25 16:11:00,14456,LOL..not me  I was a CBer before I became an Amateur/ham radio operator......
479510,bassjnkie,2010-06-25 20:45:00,1101,"Thanks Terry. I went a different route, Durham is going to set me up. Thanks again."
