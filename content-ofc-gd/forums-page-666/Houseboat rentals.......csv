I was hoping someone may have some info as to the best place to rent one??  Preferably north, distance from Toronto does not matter......obv would like a decent area for fishing.  Any input would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks"
479214,alexcba,2010-06-24 22:30:00,634,"bob caygun (sp?) i believe has it, also pretty much all over the 1000 islands is a ton of house boat rental places.  google ""house boat renals"" you'll fill the page rather quickly."
479218,lew,2010-06-24 22:47:00,12766,"I don't have any personal experience with this company or know anything about them, but I've been seeing their houseboats on the Kawarthas for years.  It's a place to start your search anyways.  http://www.houseboat.on.ca/"
479220,SBCregal,2010-06-24 22:51:00,688,we did a trip 2 yrs ago with houseboat holidays out of gananoque.  the area is really nice and there are plenty of places to dock for the night.  fishing was pretty decent.  ryan
479222,canadadude,2010-06-24 23:08:00,769,"Check out Lac Suel if you want a real adventure, there are 3 or 4 houseboat rental agencies on th lake"
479234,crappieperchhunter,2010-06-25 00:03:00,2582,Rented twice from Egan Marine. A 32 footer both times. Once a couples trip when Debbe and I went with my brother and his wife and the 2nd time we did a family trip with our 2 kids. Two of the best vacations I have ever had. We had awesome weather both times which was the key. A poor weather week would be a lot less enjoyable.  Have fun.
479239,Tom McCutcheon,2010-06-25 00:18:00,627,"I have used Egan Houseboats in the past and they are reliable and well equipped.  You could also try happydayshouseboats.com they have two new ones in their fleet that are 52' long, sleep twelve and have satelite tv and a fireplace.  both of those outfitters are on Pigeon Lake and you can get anywhere you want in a week.  Tom."
479334,irishfield,2010-06-25 05:16:00,26272,I'd do Temagami.. but slim chance you'll find one still available for this year!  Lakeland Airways/Three Buoys.. up to 10 persons.. 1-705-569-3455  Leisure Island.. 2 people perfect.. or 2 VERY friendly couples.. 1-705-569-3261
479347,Chuck Best,2010-06-25 09:26:00,308,I've done the Leisure Island tour many times and Peter and his family never did us wrong....TC and tight lines....Chuck....
479360,Billy Bob,2010-06-25 11:45:00,5865,"I rented from Three Bouys Marina back in the mid '80s and that boat was GREAT.....also rented from Egan in 2005 and we had nothing but bad luck with their boat, especially the fridge that wouldn't get or stay cold....they ended up crediting us some $$$ but it still was a bummer for the week always trying to purchase ice wherever we went....if I would do it again I would definitly go with Happydays House Boats."
479484,shan&jay,2010-06-25 18:31:00,55,rented from egan on pigeon lake last may. had a blast
479488,bow slayer,2010-06-25 18:52:00,1074,"something to consider  if you don't mind lots of other traffic,and company and going through locks and waiting then any of the ones on the trent system will do you fine. If you would like some privacy,more of a wilderness setting ,a lot less boating activity and some seclucion and no waiting at locks then Temagami would be a better choice,not to mention it has some pretty good fishing. For me it would be a no brainer,Temagami."
