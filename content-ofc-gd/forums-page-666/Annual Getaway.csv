Had to add a trolling motor and a board to hold the rods / riggers before she was ready but she looked pretty good once the sun came out   That was day 2 however - day one POURED rain. We left the cameras in the cottage - and good thing too as I was wet even through the rubberized rain suit. Day 1 fishing was pretty good - couple of walleyes in the slot we had to let go, one over (Just),    one under    in addition a few pike released and oos bass  day two was a great start in the morning with the pike banging mepps #5    for the first 24 hours we hit 24 fish,includinga couple really large sm bass that were definitley not guarding nests from their location - all were still released boat side as quickly as possible (oh man - one was like 21 inches if he as a minnow) My buddy Kev - devout trout man - never used to use spinners - he is a changed man     This guy was seriously hungry - note the bulge in the belly; hit the spinner so hard we couldn't release him   Turns out he had a taste for sunfish:   We banged over 50 fish in three days, --- and then someone closed the door. For the next 24 hours we had only two 1 perch and 1 walleye. I hear it may have had something to do with an invasion of fisherman to Lakair Lodge?  Fished from sun up to sun down with a break for a quick bite.        Took days of fishing to unwind me and make me feel relaxed -  been back to work for 5 now, and by day 2 all the benefits were gone.  Into the jaws  How long till I can do this everyday????? Sorry team 7 - usually I would come back with at least one entry but the one that could have took me under the boat and anchor rope."
