Apparently the land has a river that runs through it with a little dam attached.  My question is what kind of fish can I expect to find in this area,  has anyone been fishing there and is it worth brining the fly gear for stream trout ( if any in the area)  Any help would be appreciated  Dave"

I forgot their name, and I'm not even sure if they are there anymore.  The kayak store is still there.  They held all of the angling information to the area, so when you go through, stop in to talk to the guy.  The Gull river that runs along 35 is a white water preserve and paddling park.  It's almost impossible to fish because boaters are always paddling the white water, especially on the weekends.  There are trout in there, I know that for sure.  If the bait shop is not there, the paddling guys will know.  The owner (Strano) is an avid local angler, especially for lakers in the surrounding area.  Good luck!"

Lots of bass in the gull river, they seem to swim in schools. the burnt river in kinmount hold nice walleye, musky and bass. The bottom of the whitewater reserve also holds rainbows as they were stocked in minden lake. If you need any more info pm me as i live in minden."
