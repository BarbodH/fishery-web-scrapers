478814,Canuck,2010-06-24 00:19:00,491,Anyone confirm that Tornadoes significantly damaged Midland are?
478833,fishinfool,2010-06-24 01:00:00,366," My cousin lives in Elmvale, he tells me that it hit the Walmart in Midland and made a bit of a mess. Hopefully it dies out quick!"
478849,livinisfishin,2010-06-24 01:50:00,661,"I live in midland, trees down and power lines on the mainstreet. Honda dealership will be having a scratch and dent special soon.. Roads blocked off. Smiths camp had some severly damaged mobiles. That is all I was able to see heard there was lots more damage on hwy 12..."
478851,livinisfishin,2010-06-24 01:51:00,661,Also heard walmart was fine.
478854,LegitFish,2010-06-24 01:56:00,69,"The tornado went through king st/Hwy. 12. it ripped apart trees and power lines, and destroyed most of a trailer park. Flipped a few trucks, and most of midland is without power.  http://www.citytv.com/toronto/citynews/news/local/article/79690--possible-tornado-hits-midland"
478912,kickingfrog,2010-06-24 07:40:00,8333,"Can't confirm it, officials will be there in the morning. Sure looks like it from the photos and videos.   News reports say many other areas as well. May not hear from any in the area for a bit. Hope all is well.  Hardly a drop of rain here in Barrie."
478915,Terry,2010-06-24 09:11:00,14456,I have not seen Wayne post hope he and everyone else is fine
478919,lew,2010-06-24 09:58:00,12766,"Watched CTV this morning and it showed the trailer park where 40 odd house trailers were destroyed, but there were no deaths or serious injuries.  Unbelievably lucky."
478995,bigbuck,2010-06-24 13:19:00,2449,"Smith's Trailer Park in the south end of town was badly hit, most of the trailers were either destroyed or badly damaged. The Honda dealer had the windows blown out and about 30 odd cars were damaged. Trees were damaged and hydro got knocked out. I have a couple of calls into friends in town there and am waiting to hear back from them. I heard there were only 12 people injured and there were no deaths. Thank God for that. I will be up there tomorrow and will get a first hand look and will report back on Monday."
479042,NAW,2010-06-24 16:00:00,4022,"I was at Smith's Trailer Park until 2:30 last night with my volunteer search and rescue team.  One section of the park is destroyed, and the next section looks like nothing happened.  Even in the destroyed section, there would 3 or 4 areas where there's nothing left but cinder block foundation, and right beside it, 50' away, a trailer seemingly un-touched, flower pots still on the deck..  The section of the part that was hit hard just happens to be a spot that's mostly empty thru the week.  But very busy on the weekend.  If this would have hit on a Sat afternoon, it would have been a true disaster.  We search thru the ruble for 5 hours and didn't find anyone, thank good.  Midland dodged a bullet.."
479063,Cudz,2010-06-24 16:41:00,2652,"Well, I teach high school up in those parts and was given a phone call this morning from the principal telling me our school was closed as there is no power and hasn't been any since the tornado went through. Day off for me. Glad to hear that so far there have been no fatalities."
479177,motv8tr,2010-06-24 20:43:00,2587,"They still have Hwy 93 closed from hwy 12 to Balm Beach Rd, I assume King is closed as well.  It also hit a couple of businesses on Hwy 12 from what I heard, as well as a few trees down at Martyr's  shrine.  I had to come up the back rd and while it's clear there were trees uprooted and lots of limbs that were clearly put to the side of the rd. and the lines were still on the ground there.  I got power back roughly a little over an hour ago I'd guess.  Irishfield may still not have power back, some areas will take a little longer, hopefully by tonight..  Maureen"
479219,Tdel,2010-06-24 22:49:00,393,"  My power in Penetang came on at approximately 3:00pm today. Approximately 21 hours without hydro. Lots of damage in south end of Midland and Hwy 12. Damage on hwy 93 too. From what I have heard, the most severe injuries were broken bones. Unbelievable day.  Tom"
479308,irishfield,2010-06-25 03:52:00,26272,"Yep.. I'm still alive! Sorry! Thanks for the text messages Terry.. at least I know someone cares! lol  Thought I was gonna lose the hangar.. the airplane I was sitting in (that have been working on for the last 2 months...with 2 days left to go!) and my own stuff.. not once,, but TWICE in one day!  Spent 5 hours today getting my laneway usable again.. we had to use the runway to get to the concession road.  Genny got a good work out.. and thankfully Leah went to visit her cousins in Sarnia back on Tuesday..  What they haven't shown on the news.. Huronia Steel on #93 is out of business.. as is Sargent's Cement next door. Kindred is missing a roof.. Baytech is superficial.. as it's a steel post and beam building with none supportive cinder that came down. Ideal supply and the sports store are gone on King Street.  And I've gotta say it... God really does hate trailer parks..."
479321,alexcba,2010-06-25 04:19:00,634,glad to hear your alright irishfield.
479398,bigbuck,2010-06-25 14:01:00,2449,"Wayne, good to hear you are OK. I talked to the park owners (our place in HH) and the bulk of the damage was in Midland so I wasn't too worried about you. There is considerable damage in Midland but it can be fixed. Thankfully nobody was killed, that can't be fixed."
479399,wuchikubo,2010-06-25 14:07:00,1114,Good to hear that you're okay Wayne.
