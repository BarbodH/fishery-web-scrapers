478639,Bernie,2010-06-23 17:53:00,3190,Had a car on the hoist. It was sure moving around!
478642,16 Footer,2010-06-23 17:56:00,191," We did in St Catharines, just a small vibration."
478650,bushart,2010-06-23 18:01:00,2628,The house was shakin here in the Ottawa Valley---tried to convince the wife that was me
478651,xpedx789,2010-06-23 18:03:00,11,"Ok...This is gonna sound weird. I'm sitting in my office, and an employee calls me who is at lunch and asked me if i felt that...I said that I did not feel anything, he said his car was rocking back and forth...The weird thing is...I'm in Cleveland !"
479302,irishfield,2010-06-25 03:39:00,26272,Well Bernie.. I was sitting in an airplane suspended from the steel beam above and two block and tackles... 2 days to go on it after 2 months and I thought the hangar was coming down on it! If that wasn't bad enough.. a tornado roared thru 5 hours later...
479309,muskymike,2010-06-25 03:53:00,772,"Just like Bushart, over here in Ottawa I felt it pretty good. Was on a second floor of a house/office and it felt like the building was gonna come down.  Pretty scary yet really neat.  Wayne, I hope there is not too much damage at your place.Hope all is well around you."
479313,a.cortellessa,2010-06-25 04:03:00,142,"I was on the water.. didn't feel a thing. I kinda wanted to feel it though, not a usual thing thats for sure."
