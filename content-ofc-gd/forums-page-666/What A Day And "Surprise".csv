479541,Rizzo,2010-06-25 22:19:00,4754,Good stuff! My parents lived at lowbanks for a few years and all I ever caught were pesky 5 lb smallmouth (and the king of freshwater fish the mighty sheephead)
478544,Fish Farmer,2010-06-23 14:15:00,2234,"Glenn, Joe and myself went Perch fishing yesterday. Weatherman said the day was going to be bad, but we went anyway. Got to Erie at Lowbanks were we launched and not a soul to be seen. Bought minnows and headed out. I must say the Perch fishing was slow, maybe because of the storm moving in. It rained a few times but was fishable. We were catching a few nice size Perch, then all hell broke lose, when I was reeling in a small Perch, ""BAM"" My Spiel ultralight  rod bent almost double. The line just screamed off the reel, 6 LB test with 4 LB backing. OH NO all I could think was start the motor and chase my line. I was down to were the backing was and I could see this being the end of my screamer which at this point we didn't know what was on the line, maybe a Carp, Channel Cat, Walleye or what ever. Never thinking it would be this. Pictures will tell all.     We chased this fish, seemed like a 1/2 hour. Soon as I got it to the boat it screamed away again. What a circus.    All we had was a small net, what are we going to do? Glenn did a great job netting for what he had.        Almost 40"" Muskie, snapped a couple quick pictures. Never did find the Perch that he grabbed. The small #6 egg hook was just in the corner of his mouth. I was using a couple homemade snelled hooks and sinker below.  Back in to live another day    She started to blow up and we ran out of minnows. Plus I think we had enough. What a great day. Thanks guys for making the day possible, Joe taking the series of pictures, holding each other up from falling over in the boat, and Glenn for being a great net man. I wish we had a recorder, as we each were coaching one another. "
478547,leechunbao,2010-06-23 14:19:00,23,Nice fishing! Looks like it was a windy day~~
478550,NAW,2010-06-23 14:25:00,4022,Right on man.  Suprises like that are fun eh!  Now..  How long before a Musky man reams you out for not cutting your line right away?
478560,Roy,2010-06-23 14:44:00,13728,"Really great stuff, Dave. Avery nice fish and kudos for the skill shown bringing that one in on that pound test...not to mention the small net. There's also something to be said for those Spiel rods eh? Thanks for sharing."
478561,discophish,2010-06-23 14:45:00,392,"Darn right that was a big surprise!  When there are perch, there are bigger fish around!  Now you know what to use the next time you head out musky fishing!  <kidding>.  You have the seat that I have been looking for.  I will PM you."

478568,alexcba,2010-06-23 15:15:00,634,wtg fishfarmer! love the fight of a monster on an UL set up. great work bringing her in.
478593,kickingfrog,2010-06-23 16:32:00,8333,"So a Spiel UL rod will stand up to a muskie, but Irishfield's Spiel muskie rod can't stand up to a low bridge???  Glad your knot to your backing held, I'm always concerned mine won't."
478595,Spiel,2010-06-23 16:34:00,9065,Would you like me to build you a custom musky rod for perch fishing.
478598,fish_fishburn,2010-06-23 16:48:00,1311,"Thats awesome fishfarmer, and a million bucks of advertising for the SPIEL MONSTER UL."
478673,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-06-23 18:26:00,0,What a pleasant surprise! I know you were hoping for a 10lb perch.lol
478675,castgame,2010-06-23 18:28:00,161,on 6lb?! excellent work. you must've done a hell of a job finessing that thing
478757,cowanjo,2010-06-23 21:27:00,249,All I can say is awesome - this is going to cost you huge. yes you will hear should have cut line but this could be someone who is trolling at 30 feet or more who probably do as much damage  Anyway why this will cost you is simple. This happened to me a few years back - sons bobber and perch.....musky ate (I didnt catch like you) but I can not even fish for anything but musky now...i am addicted.  Good on you and good luck  John
478758,TJQ,2010-06-23 21:29:00,7806,Good STUFF!! Congrats!!
478767,lew,2010-06-23 21:55:00,12766,"Thanks Dave, I luv stories like that"
478846,Fish Farmer,2010-06-24 01:37:00,2234,"Thanks everyone. As many days I fish, I still get excited as it was my first. It doesn't mater what I fish for Salmon, Trout, Perch, Crappie, Whitefish, Walleye, etc. Size doesn't mater. As long as I'm on the water fishing, plus fishing with good buddy's. I guess that's why my wife says I'm a fishaholic. The Spiel Ultra Light stood the test, now my buddy wants one. Chris can you make me a Lew & Roy autograph series Muskie Rod"
479009,ccmtcanada,2010-06-24 13:57:00,7971,GREAT story!  Next time go fishing for rock bass....maybe you'll pick up a sturgeon!!!
479016,a.cortellessa,2010-06-24 14:19:00,142,Awesome job man! A muskie an an ultra light.. who would have figured? Congrats and thanks for sharing.
479035,ChrisK,2010-06-24 15:30:00,2772,I love hearing about incidental catch's like that. Something unexpected and huge tearing off line to the backing..Now thats a fight worth telling your friends about. I've only had that happen a couple of times in my fishing career but I can remember those moments like it was yesterday... Thanx for sharing FF
479412,Fish Farmer,2010-06-25 15:20:00,2234,     Thanks Guys Always seems when I'm fishing for other species I get a Muskie. I may have to start targeting them one day.
479479,lunkerbasshunter,2010-06-25 18:18:00,2585,thats great!  thanks for sharing!  cheers!
479491,OhioFisherman,2010-06-25 19:21:00,6623,LOL great! all those fish that I hooked in Lake Erie and never saw must have been Muskies! They couldn`t have been carp or sheephead!  Nice job Fish! and nice to be in a boat for the follow?
479515,ehg,2010-06-25 20:49:00,2666,"Real nice fish! Erie musky aren't pictured much, many thanks for post."
479523,lew,2010-06-25 20:58:00,12766," Hey Dave, order me one of those rods too will ya, maybe Chris will give us a deal on them if we order in bulk"
479526,Duckie,2010-06-25 21:08:00,305,wow awesome!
