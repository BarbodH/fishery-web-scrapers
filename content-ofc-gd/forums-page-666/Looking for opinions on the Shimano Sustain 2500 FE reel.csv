476214,Duckie,2010-06-16 02:09:00,305,"Hello all. well, that time has come when I want to upgrade my older stradic to a new spinner. I was looking at the Shimano Sustain 2500 FE reel. I know this isn't a cheap reel, so I was looking for experiences from those that have it or have fished with it.  any insight would be greatly appreciated!  thanks  -12 Volt  "
476340,corvette1,2010-06-16 13:59:00,1765,i have two sustains they are nice ? but are they the money over the price of a stradic if you have the money go for it
476377,fish-miester,2010-06-16 15:25:00,864,"nice reels, but so are the stradics"
476380,bigbuck,2010-06-16 15:43:00,2449,Great reel but so is the Stradic. If you want to spend the extra money go for it. Shimano's higher end stuff is really good. I'd go for one but that would mean yet another rod to go with it..... If only I had the time to use what I already have.

I also have several 2000 & 4000 Stradics . . .    if you have the extra money, and a couple hundred ain't gonna make ya go hungry . . .   go for it. If you're figuring on getting twice the reel for nearly twice the money, don't! I like the Sustains I have but they aren't much better than the Stradic, which in my estimation is a GR R R E A T reel. Good luck!"
