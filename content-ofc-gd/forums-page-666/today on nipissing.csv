479556,pikeguy,2010-06-26 00:06:00,195,went out for a run today and we maid out pretty good i would say  Shorty caught 4 and i got 4. yahoo i did not get out fished today unlike last weekend         Sorry to ppl that came up to lakair guess you came up to erly  no but we did catch them at the mouth of the west arm. It would be about 15-20 boat ride i'm guessing from lakair should have listened to corvette1 and went for a run to there.
