Didn't have much chance to run it last year. I use it on the end of my tender and I always thought it was sluggish due to style of the tender. This year, motor stalls when I give it the gas. Brought to local mechanic and told him about the reed plate exchange. He tried to fix it and can't. Sends it to local Yamaha dealer who tells him that changing the reed plate won't do anything to increase HP. Have to change exhaust system, etc as well. So, needless to say that I am pissed at the dealer who sold me the motor, then charged me another $100 for the work and now everyone is scratching their head trying to figure out why it won't go.  I won't say the name of dealer on this forum other than to say he's in the Kawartha's. I am considering reporting him to Yamaha though. I'm sure they'd be interested in this."
