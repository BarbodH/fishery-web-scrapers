479653,love2fishhave2work,2010-06-26 13:06:00,212,I have never cleaned the carpet on my Sylvan but decided this is the year.  Are there products/methonds out there that work better than others?  Advice would be greatly appreciated.

After the pressure washer, I used the shop vac then let it sit in the sun for a couple hours and it was done.  Have the transom of your boat on the downside of a slope if posssible and pull the drain plug and 99% of the water will drain out as your doing it.  Lots better than renting a carpet cleaner plus the cost of the cleaning solution."

I know that it depends on usage but generally speaking....do you clean your boats out thoroughly once a year? Once a month? After every outing?  And yes, I use a pressure washer too...spray any dirt spots with a mild detergent...a few scrubs with a brush then wash away."

I had been looking for a way to clean the carpet in my boat for several years and used spot cleaner etc.  Recently the people on this board recommended the power wash system - and it worked great.   Set your washer on fan spray and like Lew suggested - open the drain plug and try to have your boat tilted to the back. I wouldn,t recommend using too much/any soap - apparently that just takes longer to was out.  I was amazed at how much crud washed out of my carpet and how good it looked when done.  I used the shop vac to suck outta the carpet as much water as I could. Half a day in the sun the boat was dry.  This will certainly be something I do much more often."
