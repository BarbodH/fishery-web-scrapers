479671,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-06-26 15:10:00,0," Uruguay maybe. They have good defense and have yet to be scored on.  I think Germany will take England out.  Well Argentina has a significant amount of Italians(more than anywhere else) and that is the next best thing.lol  Ghana may very well pull the upset. They are very poor defenders but they have offense and have been the most impressive African team for the last two world cups. Bad calls is the only reason they didn't make it further last time around. This year it looks like they are having a hard time finishing. If the strikers can find the back of the net, they will eliminate USA."
479672,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-06-26 15:13:00,0, lol. This time England doesn't have Canada to back them up.  What ever did happen to team Canada? You telling me they didn't qualify? I would have loved to see the qualifying match. They should air it next time around!
479702,BillsTheBassMan,2010-06-26 18:06:00,932," Well Johnny, you know I always appreciate your posts, but this one makes me   :wallbash:  Italy DID NOT have a very strong team.  They had a weak transitional team that couldn't get out of a group of nobodies (Paraguay being a slight exception, but still a nobody on the greater scale of things).  Italy had a team that, like last world cup, hoped to defend defend defend (as stated by Cannavaro himself) and hoped to get random goals here and there.  They had NO playmakers on this Italian team (with the injury to Pirlo).  They were left with a bunch of subpar goons, who looked the part, but certainly didn't play the part.  If you remember the last world cup, it was the same strategy.  DEFEND DEFEND DEFEND and just wait for a goal scoring opportunity.  Totti dove in the box vs Australia in the round of 16 and was foolishly awarded the penalty.  They tried to push 0-0 games to extra time and break them down in extra time with the likes of Del Piero.  It worked.  It stood no chance of working again as that team featured the likes of a younger Gattuso, Pirlo, Totti, Del Piero, Nesta, Buffon, a decent Cannavaro (man is past it now), and a decent Zambrotta (same as Cannavaro).  And again, you're right, they have recently had disgusting offence and they need to figure that out sooner rather than later.  You're right about the Dutch too.  They won't win as they lack any measure of defense.  They're not what people are cracking them up to be.  I predicted this at Euro (I couldn't at the last world cup as they couldn't muster qualification), and I'm predicting it again.  Betting against the dutch is generally a safe bet."
479707,bongo,2010-06-26 18:29:00,67,"Oh Johnnybass changes his mind now, Uruguay might go on, you were just making fun of them last night, what's the matter you found out that there is one guy on the team that has an Italian last name? LOL   Italy is out, that's it you have no more say in the matter, lol. just teasing you"
479727,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-06-26 20:35:00,0," Hey, everyone is entitled to their own opinion. In my opinion both Italy AND France had strong teams and that is why they made it to the finals. For a team to shut down Brazil like France did says it all.  We had guys like Grosso, Matterazzi, Zambrotta, Cannarvaro, play defense. We had powerful midfielders like Gatuso and Pirlo. We had some great offense like Totti(who was always double teamed, Luca Toni, not sure if del piero was there. ALl of which could put the ball in the net.Not to mention one of the best goaltenders(if not the best) in the world(Buffon). All these guys are world class soccer players.  Most of our offense is retired I'm thinking(should have played Gilardino more)? Where was Luca Toni? And Di Natale stunk. We still had one play maker. Camoranesi, which the coach did not play in the third game. But other than that, the entire team played poor with the exceptions of Zambrotta, Camoranesi,De Rossi and Pepe.  Apparently there is another Rossi that is supposed to be good but Lippi didn't pick him on the team.  Italy has always been a defensive team. That's their style, but I think they may have to work on their offense. On the weak teams they were playing, they could have came straight up the middle as opposed to trying to come in from the sides.  It is clear Italy and France are rebuilding so it may take awhile before they are back on top."
479728,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-06-26 20:37:00,0, Ya one of the guys last name sounds a little Italian.lol I said there is a possibility. I didn't say I was cheering for them.  Hey that's what the world cup is all about. Teasing and bragging rights.
479729,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-06-26 20:39:00,0,"Anyways, good luck to the rest of the teams and may the best team win!!"
479160,misfish,2010-06-24 20:03:00,29133," Yes Japan has played very well. Just watching now.2-0 for them,but having some mental lappes."
479161,jedimaster,2010-06-24 20:04:00,3472,Watching Japan take it to Denmark right now.
479167,JohnF,2010-06-24 20:24:00,3494,Maradona must have been really something to watch as a player with all that intensity.  JF
479168,alexcba,2010-06-24 20:25:00,634, BAHAHAHHAAHA i hope john see's this!
479169,BillsTheBassMan,2010-06-24 20:25:00,932," I'm 90% sure the Germans will beat the English.  Germany can beat anyone in the world @ any given time, including Argentina.  That Argentina backfield could crack at any given time.  People consistently under-estimate the Germans as they're not flashy.  Germany is balanced.  This time around they are young and Ozel is ridiculously good.  The Ballack injury was an absolute blessing (and I say this as both a Chelsea and a Germany supporter).  I'm not saying we're going to beat Argentina should we both get there, but the game will be extremely close and hard fought."
479179,bongo,2010-06-24 20:57:00,67,"  I'm not underestimating Germany, they are powerful, they run as hard as the African teams, and have amazing ball passing. But Argentina has been waiting for this moment for the past 20 + years, and that short little Messi guy, lol, has amazing aim not to mention the rest of the Argentinians.  Anyway, Germany, Argentina, Brazil, and the Netherlands are all powerful teams this year"
479181,JohnF,2010-06-24 21:03:00,3494," Is that what they mean by a ""clutch player""?  JF"
479182,alexcba,2010-06-24 21:07:00,634,yeah if were talking about a clutch of eggs.. lol  he was probably the most badass and hardest player on the pitch.. now he's a movie star.. lol
479185,Syn,2010-06-24 21:21:00,519,I like when the camera man shows clips of the game fans.      
479196,Mattones,2010-06-24 21:57:00,587,Yes! Italy is out and Netherlands won! What a GREAT day!!!  If I see any Italy flags on cars from now on I will be sure not to only give the 'dive' hand signal but point and laugh then wave my Netherlands Flag
479207,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-06-24 22:18:00,0,Very nice syn. The first one has a great set and the last one has a beautiful face. Whats with all the Italian haters?? If Robben gets back to form Netherlands might have a chance.
479349,bigugli,2010-06-25 09:54:00,6138,Italt was certainly dominated by the Slovaks. Well played.  Why the italian haters? Italians play a dirty game of football. Very good at fouling the oppposition without drawing the penalties.  Then again one could write books about the Scots.
479455,cuzza,2010-06-25 17:46:00,467, Doing what? Not qualifying for tournaments? Supporting any team the English play against?
479506,lucabrasi,2010-06-25 20:29:00,114,"Yeah, why all the Italy hate. You don't win 4 cups without being great at football. To the Germany supporter, no diving when the Italians beat the Germans 4 years ago. That was one of the greatest displays of European football (by both teams) that I've seen in a while. In light of that I might understand your hate. I certainly don't hate the Germans. All teams engage in diving and dirty play. If you don't think so, you're not watching closely enough or you're letting your bias get in the way. I've also noticed a lot teams whose only recourse to surviving the group stages is to play a great game of rugby. That's kind of sad too.  My favourites the rest of the way, Argentina, Netherlands. I'd like to see the Netherlands win, I've got them in my office pool."
479570,misfish,2010-06-26 01:14:00,29133," You sound just like the guy at work. Whatever they won it 4 years ago.Just like his ice hockey team the Pens.They won last year.        It,s all history.     Get over it    Stop living in the PAST.   Thers always someone bigger and better.   Lookout for the dark horse,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,   Japan"
479586,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-06-26 02:15:00,0," Name a team that doesn't dive. You think the Slovaks weren't killing time at the end of the game faking injuries? And to use up all your substitutes to kill time? Its part of the game but all this spells bad sportsmanship. Unfortunately, they all do this and it is part of the game.  Slovaks played well, but I think the real reason we lost is bad goaltending. If Buffon wasn't injured and was in net? NONE of those goals would have been in. 3 BAD goals. As bad as our team played? We would have still chipped in a goal.The second reason is bad coaching.  We had one of the easiest divisions and we blew it. I didn't expect Italy to win, bujt they should have advanced to the next round. Oh well, we will wait for the next WC. Unfortunately most of the veterans will not be there....  Japan???LMAO!!!!"
479587,Mattones,2010-06-26 02:27:00,587,"Good riddance to Italy. The only reason they won the World Cup last is that they cheated their way and cried like a 4 year old girl every time someone touched them. Oh my leg, my leg, mamma mia!  These guys would earn my respect and countless others as well if they played soccer the way they play it is meant to be played and won on skill.. not on cunning.  PS: Go Netherland"
479589,bongo,2010-06-26 02:28:00,67,"  Yes everyone noticed how the Slovaks killed time at the end of the game, you know what gooooood!!!!  Now the Italians understand how annoying it is when someone does it to them  Just because you are Italian, you gotta support your Italian Heritage (Italy), okay good but except defeat, Italy is not the best. And when you mentioned Argentina, you said that because there lots of Italians in Argentina you are rooting for them, what is that man???  I support Argentina because they are a great football team. Same goes for Brazil and Portugal, everybody is sick of the cockiness. People want to see a team play like a team, not a bunch of showoffs. And a good example of that is Germany, Argentina, Netherlands, Japan, USA, and Uruguay.  Expect to see one of those as champions"
479590,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-06-26 02:33:00,0, Ya right!We had a very strong team! And we played well. But I think Italy should start working on their offence. Every year they start off slow and barely get by to the next round and they get better as the tournament progresses.This time they didn't squeek by the first round.  When was the last time Netherlands won a World Cup? And you could bet money they aren't going to win this year either. Even if they cheated and played like a 4 year old girl. What does that tell you?  It tells you that DEFENCE wins world cups and Netherlands is very much lacking in that department.
479591,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-06-26 02:36:00,0," Like I said. All teams do it. So dont single out the Italians. Did I not accept defeat?lol  What is that? its just like the Portuguese that go fro Brazil when their team is out, claiming Brazilians are Portuguese.  USA?? Uruguay?? Japan?? Win the world cup????You must be joking."
479596,bongo,2010-06-26 03:13:00,67,"   Trust me it could happen, just like Italy won it before and came out last this year, lol, but the two teams i'm rooting for are Argentina and Germany  And Argentina is not Italy, it might have a 15 or 20% Italian population, but most of Argentina is Spanish, the rest Eastern European, Middle Eastern, and others, I guess like other North American countries  Now tomorrow's games are Uruguay vs. South Korea and USA vs. Ghana  don't be surprised if Uruguay and USA move on to the next round"
479606,CLofchik,2010-06-26 03:28:00,854,"Heh, they're already calling this the ""WW2 Cup""  The French and Italians surrendered early, USA doesn't show up to play until the last 15 minutes of the game and the English are left to face the Germans."
479611,bongo,2010-06-26 03:35:00,67,"  You got a good point, but you forgot the Ruskis, they are not in there"
479617,a.cortellessa,2010-06-26 03:47:00,142,Italy crap the bed
479631,Dutchy,2010-06-26 04:30:00,416, And your point is what?  I will never support engerlund no matter the sport.   :thumbsup_anim:
479053,kickingfrog,2010-06-24 16:17:00,8333,"As someone with no allegiance to a specific team it is very entertaining to watch the world cup.  Supreme athletic ability Great spectacle Drama Questionable calls and grown men flopping on the ground like 7 year old girls who have been slapped.  A true fan of a team I'm sure would be driven mad, but for me, it is simply great entertainment."
479054,alexcba,2010-06-24 16:20:00,634,"even when my team is in it i still make fun and call them morons. ""oh no a gust of wind! im gonna fall down and grab my face and knee at the same time hoping the wind will get a card..""  this is why hockey players will always be tougher than soccer players. stamina maybe not, but toughness for sure. no argument."
479059,JohnF,2010-06-24 16:34:00,3494,Hopefully we can keep this soccer thread alive with no one trying to turn it into a personal political football (pun intended).  I'm not a soccer fan but it's gotten so first thing before dinner I'm turning the tv to the FIFA report and then watching the feature game rerun later in the evening. My wife's not thrilled but that's why we got a tv for the bedroom. Soccer is more important than survivor or one of those silly shows. I can't believe my apparently intelligent wife wastes time watching shows like that.  I figger I'll soon know enuf about it to start picking teams to cheer for.  JF

After all of these injuries I got up and ran back to my goal. The players on the field take the same hits as hockey players do, but without the equipment and the ability to hit back for fear of ejection."
479064,Governator,2010-06-24 16:41:00,879,"I've never been a fan of soccer, infact up until this tournament I had never seen a full soccer game in my life.  But thanks to some great streaming of the games on CBC.ca I've been watching most games monday-friday while working.   It's actually become a bit of an addiction and I've finally understood most (if not all) of the rules of the game.  These guys are true athletes, albeit some are very disrepectful to the game itself.  I couldn't imagine running for 90min+ with only a short break inbetween."

Next Match Vs England, The following match in all likelihood vs Argentina.  VERY VERY Difficult.  The world cup, the eurocup, and Champions league are always great events, even for casual fans.  This world cup, as kicking frog stated, has been providing tons of great enterntainment.  My hats off to the South Africans for putting on a very well organized show and hosting this great tournament.  It only gets better from here.  No Italy = Awesome - always been my second most hated squad - bunch of divers.  No France = Great - They shouldn't have been there anyways.  No Portugal = Hopefully - They are my most hated squad.  Divers, Cheats, Whiners, Whimps, Actors, you name it, they play it.  I suspect I'll support whoever beats the Germans (should they lose) whether it be the three lions or Maradona and Co (which is where I think the Germans will lose)."
479154,cuzza,2010-06-24 19:50:00,467,I think Argentina look ominously good along with Holland. I don't hold out much hope for England on Sunday.  This is Vinnie Jones in action on Paul Gascoigne......  
479155,BillsTheBassMan,2010-06-24 19:55:00,932," The Dutch always unravel.  At the last Euro they looked more devastating before falling apart in a 3-1 defeat against the Russians (who couldn't even qualify for the World Cup).  The Dutch will fall apart somewhere along the way, and their defensive incapabilities will catch up with them.  The Argentinians could very well win this tournament and they seem more passionate than I have ever seen them, and love him or hate him, I credit that much to Maradona.  He has easily been the most entertaining manager to watch.  Like the dutch, Argentina suffers a bit in the backfield, but they have more firepower than anyone else in the tournament.  They'll be relying on that out-balancing the subpar backfield (which is still significantly better than Hollands)"
479156,misfish,2010-06-24 19:57:00,29133," Im not worried.They will beat England.     This one scares me more. If the Geramns can get past them,they should take the whole thing.   Finaly dont have to put up with a lard ass co-worker.HAHAHAHA.Boy were the  Slovak fellas given him the razz after that game.    Thats all I got to say about that."
479158,bongo,2010-06-24 19:59:00,67,"  Definitely Argentina and the Netherlands in the end, glad Italy and Greece are out too much drama!!  Also, Japan, USA, and Uruguay have played some superb Football"
