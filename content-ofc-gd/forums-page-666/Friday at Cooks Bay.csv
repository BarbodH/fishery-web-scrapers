479615,a.cortellessa,2010-06-26 03:44:00,142,Fished cooks bay on friday for pike.   Caught this big bass on a husky jerk with a 12 inch steel leader while going for pike! Seemed pretty tired out. The spawn must have done it.  I have other pics but the files are too big to upload apparently. Anyone have any tips to help me upload them?  Thanks
479675,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-06-26 15:21:00,0, upload them to photo bucket.com And then copy and paste the direct link between And presto.  I went fishing at Sparrow yesterday and cleaned house! I was fishing deep waters and caught some decent bass which means they are off their beds!
