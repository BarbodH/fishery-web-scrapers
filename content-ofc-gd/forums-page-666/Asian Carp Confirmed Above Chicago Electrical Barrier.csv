479507,craigdritchie,2010-06-25 20:29:00,1586,"It's a little more complicated than that. We have all seen how nature took its course after ""immigrants"" like sea lamprey and double-crested cormorants gained access to the Great Lakes. In each case, the results have been nothing short of catastrophic.  This is no different."
479518,Roy,2010-06-25 20:52:00,13728,"When this Asian carp fiasco was first being discussed quite a while back, a very good friend and guide told me that the ONLY option was to poison the affected waterway(s). At the time, I thought that his option was a little drastic. I now know better."
479536,Terry,2010-06-25 21:40:00,14456,"and now that is too late  unless they poison Lake Michigan too  well it wasn't that many years ago they thought it was dead, I guess they could kill it again"
479567,Dave Bailey,2010-06-26 01:10:00,1641," The cormorants are native actually, they have simply undergone a population explosion lately. But they have always been around."
479584,wuchikubo,2010-06-26 02:08:00,1114,"Here's an idea, why doesn't someone at the MNR send some people to capture as many cormorants as they can and sell them (MNR could use the money) to the areas just south of Lake Michigan where the Asian carp are, clip their wings so they can't fly away. Since cormorants are natural fish predators they should eat the smaller carp and continued netting of the bigger carp will still be needed, wouldn't they make good organic fish fertilizer? We also need to find a market for the cormorants, how far from the taste of duck would be, anyone know?  Some other thoughts:  If the fish has edible meat: Fish meat balls or fish paste. Places down there could set up a new attraction or festival that would draw more attention.  Free Asian carp fishing license with no limit or seasons in the affected areas. With no C&R allowed.  Just some thoughts."

479647,Dave Bailey,2010-06-26 12:16:00,1641,Howzabout this - Asian carp = free organic fertilizer. Chop 'em up and plow 'em under.
479039,craigdritchie,2010-06-24 15:56:00,1586,"I guess we all knew it was just a matter of time - pasted below is a news wire report issued an hour ago confirming the presence of adult Asian carp upstream of the electrical barrier designed to keep them out of the Great Lakes. The fish was electroshocked in Lake Calumet, which flows directly into Lake Michigan near Chicago, IL.  Craig     Asian Carp Found Above Great Lakes Electric Barrier   A bighead Asian carp has been found in Lake Calumet, the first confirmed above the electric barrier system designed by the Army Corps of Engineers to prevent the fish from entering the Great Lakes.  The Asian Carp Regional Coordinating Committee announced the finding and said it plans to follow up with more sampling, then with efforts that include netting and electrofishing in the next several weeks.  The 34.6-inch, 19.6-pound bighead carp was discovered about six miles between Lake Michigan and the T.J. O'Brien Lock and Dam during regular samplings taken by an Illinois Department of Natural Resources contracted commercial fisherman.  Within the Chicago Area Waterway System, this was just the second Asian carp discovered.  Silver and bighead are the two most aggressive types of Asian carp. A common weight for either of them is 60 pounds and they can consume up to half of their body weight in a day. If they establish sustainable populations in the Great Lakes, they could devastate these ecosystems.  In addition, Asian carp in the Mississippi and Illinois rivers have physically injured boaters by leaping out of the water when disturbed.  ""We commend the IDNR for their ongoing vigilance in catching this fish and identifying evidence that the Asian carp has now been above the barrier. The Great Lakes Boating Federation advises the less-frequent use of the Chicago-area locks,"" said Ned Dikmen, chairman of the Great Lakes Boating Federation."

Putting faith in a barrier that was continually proven not to work was a great plan. I suggest you take up waterskiiing in the Chicago area, for a chance to fully address this issue."

479255,timmeh,2010-06-25 01:20:00,609,"Well this may be the first confirmed catch, but I suspect they've been in the lake for much longer. Just like the case of cougars in Ontario, the MNR has just confirmed what many have known for years.  This certainly is bad news but I will hold out hope that this will not be the end of the great lakes. Keep in mind that both zebra mussels and gobies were supposed to destroy the lakes as well. Large ecosystems such as the great lakes are resilient. Not good, but I'm not going to sell the fishing gear yet."
479284,livinisfishin,2010-06-25 02:35:00,661,"All I meant was that as humans we can be accepted to wherever we move to or travel. What's so bad about nature taking its course and seeing how it plays out. Sorry splashhopper I shouldn't have used the word immigrant, and I should have gone more in depth at the very beginning. Yes I am comparing this species of fish to humans."
