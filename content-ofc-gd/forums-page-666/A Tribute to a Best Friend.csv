478948,John,2010-06-24 11:53:00,2956,"We have been there a few times ourselves Jer. Take solace in the fact that you had 12 great years and that his life could not have been better. The loss is tough but the reward of having them in our lives more than makes up for it.  There is a bridge connecting Heaven and Earth. It is called the Rainbow Bridge because of its many colors. Just this side of the Rainbow Bridge, there is a land of meadows, hills and valleys with lush green grass. When a beloved pet dies, the pet goes to this place. There is always food and water, and warm Spring weather. Those old and frail animals are young again. Those who have been maimed are made whole again. They play all day with each other. But there is only one thing missing. They are not with their special person who loved them on earth. So, each day they run and play until the day comes when one suddenly stops playing and looks up. The nose twitches, the ears are up, the eyes are staring, and this one suddenly runs from the group. You have been seen, and when you and your special friend meet, you take him or her in your arms and embrace. Your face is kissed again and again and again and you look once more into the eyes of your trusting pet. Then you cross the Rainbow Bridge together, never again to be separated.  Author unknown"

479174,Flappn,2010-06-24 20:40:00,245,"Sorry about your loss, sounds like Mister Bear was quite the dog and family member. It's never fun when we lose a Pet. My condolences."
479176,fishnsled,2010-06-24 20:42:00,3520,"It sucks to loose a good friend. Treasure the good times, shouldn't be difficult as there seems to be many. Sorry for your loss."

I lost my hound 6 years ago from being poisoned and my wife and I were torn....she didn't want another dog but I was persistant and we went to the local Humane Society in Arnprior.....these were the 2 brats left from a litter of 8 and we couldn't find it in our hearts to leave them there....we adopted them and the household was happy again   They're are boys now!!

479205,Big Cliff,2010-06-24 22:16:00,6899,"I am so very sorry for your loss, it's obvious that he loved you as much as you loved him. That was a beautiful tribute!  Keep him in your heart forever!"
479209,alexcba,2010-06-24 22:21:00,634,"this is the second time i went thru that tribute, and even tho he's been walked and fed i decided to take my little guy for another nice long walk and gave him a big bone and a hug. its amazing how much of an impact an animal can have on a human life. they go from being a pet, to a part of the family, and almost like a child."
479245,esoxansteel,2010-06-25 00:45:00,1307,"Sorry to hear of your loss, losing a best friend whos been with you for that many years is devastating, when my German Shorthaired Pointer had to be put down, it was hard to believe I was doing the right thing again after 12 years, you have lots of great memories and pics that will carry your family through those tough days. I purchased a large picture frame which holds 8 pics of my GSP so I see her every day in my rec room ot my memory room as I like to call it.  "
479333,irishfield,2010-06-25 05:07:00,26272,Happy Sunfish hunting Mister Bear!! A sad day Jer... but I wish we could do the same distinguished deed for our human friends as well..  Still miss our Lab(s)
478769,Jer,2010-06-23 22:03:00,1426,"Yesterday was sad, sad day. The day finally came that Mister Bear had to go to sleep.  He had been quite ill for awhile, the last week he was unable to keep any food down, the last couple days he refused to eat anything at all and his back end was failing badly.  The house feels so empty today. For twelve years, since I was blessed with his company at nine months of age, he has been at the door when I got home. I think it will be awhile before we get another dog, it just hurts too much when it's their time to go.  I put a little photo montage together of the big guy. Sort of the ""Life & Times of Mister Bear"":   One of his favourite past times, on the sunfish hunt:   He was a handsome fellow:     Loved to go for walks with his family:   Introduction to his new house mates:   It wasn't long til they were the best of friends:   Hangin' out with his buddy Freddy at Emily Park:   Camping at Crotch Lake:     Gimme a belly rub:   Checkin' out the catch of the day:   To swim or not to swim:   Hangin' out in the camper, what a good looking dog:   He loved boat rides, this was my last time out with him, crappy fishing early this spring:   This is one of my favourite pics, Woof Woof, Mr Bear, Woof Woof!    He was GOOD dog, the BEST.  Take care Mister Bear, I'll always miss you!"
478771,Gregoire,2010-06-23 22:07:00,1397,Sorry for your loss. That was a touching tribute.
478775,camillj,2010-06-23 22:22:00,1988,Sorry for your loss - looks like it was a great 12 years for the both of you - hang on to that bud !
478776,lew,2010-06-23 22:24:00,12766,"It's pretty obvious that Mister Bear was a wonderful friend to you Jer, and I'm sure he felt the same about you. Always a terrible day when we have to make that decision, but we know we're doing the best for our pals.  That was a beautiful tribute to your friend.  You have my condolances Jer, I'm also a dog lover."
478778,Jewelbee,2010-06-23 22:29:00,422,"I'm so sorry to hear of your loss It seems he was a true member of your family.   THE DOGS WHO HAVE SHARED OUR LIVES  The dogs who've shared our lives. In subtle ways they let us know their spirit still survives. Old habits still make us think we hear a barking at the door. Or step back when we drop a tasty morsel on the floor. Our feet still go around the place the food dish used to be, And, sometime, coming home at night, we miss them terribly. And although time may bring new friends and a new food dish to fill, That one place in our hearts belongs to them... and always will.  ---Linda Barnes ---"
478781,bigugli,2010-06-23 22:48:00,6138,"It is so sad to have to let them go, but it is for the best. I'm sure Mr Bear loved you as much as you loved him."

478870,Nipfisher,2010-06-24 02:32:00,2449,"I fear this day is not too far for me now. My 11 year old border collie lab cross is not the spry dog he once was. We have had 2 children who have climbed on him , poked his eyes, and pulled his whiskers and all he'd do is get up and move. Mister Bear is playing in the big doggy park in the shy. My dog Duffy will be there too. My condolences Jer."

478873,Nanook,2010-06-24 02:44:00,565,Sorry for your loss Jer. Always a hard decision.I've had to do it 3 times. Never easy.
478886,BillsTheBassMan,2010-06-24 03:19:00,932,"I can really feel for you here and I think your tribute is amazing and touching.  Let me tell you from personal experience - it will get much better and the memories are PRICELESS.  The feeling of connection never goes away and you'll hope that one day, you'll see the big fella again  My dog, Bo (got him during the Bo Jackson Era, and I was young), lived to 14.  He was a yellow lab, 130lbs of pure beast ahaha, he almost died in a hunt camp accident at 2 years old, and $2500 later he fully recouped after intensive surgery.  My dad carried him out of the bush, tied him up with the shirt off his back, and saved his life.  He was diagnosed with cancer at 11, but being the charmer he was, he got himself into the Guelph University Vet program for free treatment.  Their help, and the help of our amazing vet, extended his life for 3 happy years after being said that he only had 3 months.  I had him from when I was 8 to 22 and he was definitely the best friend anyone could ask for.  On the day he was going to be put down (after the cancer finally started getting the best of it) I was hugging him in the back hall and with his last bit of energy he licked my face.  To this day I think he knew what was going on.  I still don't have another dog (6 years later)as it just didn't seem right until a few months ago.  Our family often sits around talking about him for an hour, laughing at the hilarious things he did (plentiful until the day he died), and all the good memories.  There is limited sadness now and lots of laughs.  You'll reach this point too.  Just recently, I've decided I'll soon be ready for another dog and my girlfriend and I have been going to the Humane Society to walk dogs and make their days a little brighter (sneak some treats in sometimes too!).  All the best in your grieving - My condolences are strongly offered as I know EXACTLY how you feel right now.  I found that talking about it (such as this tribute) helped a lot.  Laughing at some of the memories is always good.  Regards and thanks for sharing, Ryan"
478901,alexcba,2010-06-24 04:47:00,634,"truly sorry for your loss. you clearly loved him tho, and he did you as well. he's on the big dock in the sky now. probably chasing the sunfish he put there lol. great tribute man."

478929,FLEX ROD,2010-06-24 11:15:00,394,"I have been in your shoes before, it is hard, very hard to put your best friend down.  When I did it with my first dog, 32 years ago I said that I would not get another dog, and I held that thought for 28 years. 4 years ago the kids and the wife ganged up on me and wanted a dog, so I caved in, and this is the shocking part as much as my first dog was a fantastic part of my life our dog today is even more of a family member.  Don't do what I did and wait that long, the bond that comes from our best friends is really priceless.  FLEX"
