The amount of poaching on that lake is sick in the spring. Ya - I could tell you what one of the wraps was (an apple farm sponsor of all things) but what is the point - they'll just try to deny it. The same boat cut me off by 100 feet and proceeded to start fishing last summer as I was fishing a shoreline with my children. Just a minor rant. I am home sick this morning and a little bitter!"
