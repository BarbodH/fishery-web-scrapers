474475,fish-miester,2010-06-10 17:52:00,864,"Hey I have a few friends that live on and near Bay lake. in around Novar/Emsdale area. they honestly normally dont have much luck on the lake. and instead they prefer to fish other surrounding lakes. I believe there are LM/SM Bass , Splake , and rock bass in Bay Lake.. though I have yet to fish it as they dont really like to when there are so many other lakes to choose from up there! but if you do go let me know how you make out!"
474502,cityfisher,2010-06-10 18:51:00,959,"I stayed and fished there for a week last year, SMALL lake with lots of cottages and boats. We caught a couple bass here and there but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone."
474514,fish-miester,2010-06-10 19:20:00,864,ya like Cityfisher said.. If your in the area and have acess to a boat and trailer.. try a few of the other lakes. but I have been told to stay away from Bay Lake and I think the other 1 right next to it is sand lake.. but i could be wrong.. but its not to great either..
479109,BucktownAngler,2010-06-24 18:09:00,582,thanks for the help. i wont have access to a boat (unless i can rent one around that area) but ill do what i can off shore and let you guys know how it is.  im heading up there Canada Day weekend btw
479126,Flappn,2010-06-24 18:59:00,245,"I have a trailer on Sand Lake and ya I would not plan on going fishing there or Bay Lake. I travel to surrounding lakes like Bernard, Doe Lake and so on."
479311,BucktownAngler,2010-06-25 03:57:00,582, how far are these lakes from Bay Lake? any boat rentals out there?
479318,a.cortellessa,2010-06-25 04:15:00,142,If you're stuck on it you could always go for crappie
479378,fish-miester,2010-06-25 13:08:00,864,liek live.to.fish said.. if your stuck on that lake then why not try and learn the lake.. who know you might end up showing us Bay lake/sand lake haters up!
