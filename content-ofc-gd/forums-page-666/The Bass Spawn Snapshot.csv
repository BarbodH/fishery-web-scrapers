For those of you that have been hunting the Georgian, Kawarthan and Muskokan waters regularly I'm wondering what your general opinion is as to the current state of the bass from those OOS you've seen or caught recently?  Would you say the spawn beds are clear and they're in the lethargic post-spawn or have they recovered from that already and starting to feed actively again?  Rigged  "
479435,Raf,2010-06-25 16:36:00,3495,everything's a month ahead.  bass will have spawned long ago.
479450,uglyfish,2010-06-25 17:21:00,981,"yup, bass spawn is long over. they're not even post spawn now... its a summer pattern for this opener!"
479490,Harrison,2010-06-25 19:18:00,2202,"Agree with the above. I'll be fishing a summer pattern on opener.  However, if they tell me different I'll switch.  There's some solid slop mats already with early boating season."
479516,BillsTheBassMan,2010-06-25 20:49:00,932,"Yep Rigged, pretend it is Late July, close to the ""dog days"" of summer.  You may have to slow things down a little more than you typically would come the opener.  GL"
