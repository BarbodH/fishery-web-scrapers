478958,FLEX ROD,2010-06-24 12:18:00,394,"Okay folks when my dad died in March, my mother gave me his 2000 Jeep Cherokee but the truck only has a radio and tape deck. One would have thought that a 2000 Laredo would have had a cd player in it, well it does not and in 6 days my son and I are heading up to Nakina to go and visit EDDIE, in Attawapiskat but that is just too long and too far to travel without some toones. Does anybody know how or what is needed to connect an IPOD? The radio / tape deck does not have any auxiliary ports it is a standard unit from Chrysler.   Any and all advice is appreciated.  Thank you,   FLEX"
478964,Raf,2010-06-24 12:24:00,3495,fm transmitter  it will play on an fm frequency on your dial  inexpensive units can be had at factorydirect
478965,Rattletrap2,2010-06-24 12:27:00,1652,"You can pick up an adaptor. I got mine at Costco. You just plug it into the cigarette lighter socket with iPod in it and tune the car radio to a station not in use. When the adaptor and radio are set to the same station, it plays the ipod over that station. Works okay, better in some places than others."
478967,FLEX ROD,2010-06-24 12:28:00,394," Many thanks Raf, that is what I was looking for as I do not want to replace the exsiting unit, just not worth it in my oppion.  Thank you.  FLEX"
478968,Raf,2010-06-24 12:29:00,3495, it's not.. especially when you figure out how much stuff you gotta yank to get at the stereo in the jeep
478969,Sudzy,2010-06-24 12:30:00,88,Canadian Tire often has a half decent FM transmitter than goes on sale for $10 at 50% off fairly often. Keep an eye out for it.
478971,FLEX ROD,2010-06-24 12:33:00,394,"  Great thanks, I will check our Cosco and see if they have it as it is closer than Factory Direct, but it sounds like we have two different solutions, which one would work better any ideas?  Thanks,  FLEX"
478972,Raf,2010-06-24 12:33:00,3495,same solution worded differently
478976,FLEX ROD,2010-06-24 12:39:00,394," You are very correct about the point of how much effoer would be required in replacing the unit in a Jeep, it would not be as easy as it was in the past.  Any way, Cosco here I come.  Thank you, all, gents.  FLEX"
478977,Rattletrap2,2010-06-24 12:40:00,1652," Yep, the adaptor I am talking about is an FM transmitter. This is one, mine is slightly different.  My link"
478979,dave524,2010-06-24 12:45:00,4508,"If it has a cassette deck, there used to be a kizmo that looked like a casette with a wire hanging out of it that you plugged into. Really don't know if they are still being made, but they don't need power as I recall, had one for playing a CD player through a vehicle."
478983,cuzza,2010-06-24 13:01:00,467,"This is the thing Dave is referring to  http://www.canadiantire.ca/AST/browse/4/Auto/AutoAccessories/Plugin12VoltAccessories/PRD~0374464P/Digipower%252BAudio%252BCassette%252BAdaptor.jsp?locale=en  I had one in a car with no aux and it was great, the FM transmitters are good but I've found quality can be a problem (no idea why when the transmitter is next to the radio!!!) the cassette adaptor is hardwired so is more consistent.  The FM transmitters do charge the ipod though, so you might want to add one of these and plug the ipod lead into it.  http://www.canadiantire.ca/AST/browse/4/Auto/AutoAccessories/AutomotiveCellPhoneAccessories/PRD~0374457P/Certified%252B12V%252BUSB%252BBattery%252BCharger%252BAdaptor.jsp?locale=en  Cheers"
478987,Raf,2010-06-24 13:05:00,3495,"fm transmitters:  if you're in a major metropolitan area, sometimes you can have problems with interference from ""real"" radio stations.  it's a matter of finding a clear frequency.. in toronto they are few and far between -- i think i use 104.1.  you will not have that issue north of 7.  if you start getting interference, switch to a different frequency."
478988,BillM,2010-06-24 13:06:00,17367,"Yup, like Raf said FM transmitter is the easiest way to go.  They should have 4 separate frequencies to choose from also if you encounter interference..."

479061,JohnF,2010-06-24 16:38:00,3494, My audiophile son says the tape deck adapter is the absolute best way to go. And they are still available for about $10.  JF
479066,Devious,2010-06-24 16:48:00,49, Yup I find these a lot better then the AM/FM transmitters.  Futureshop Cassette Adaptor  Best Buy Cassette Adaptor  Canadian Tire Cassette Adaptor

479095,otter649,2010-06-24 17:39:00,118,    The cassette adaptor is the way to go as you can use for IPOD & MP3 players as well.........
479114,FLEX ROD,2010-06-24 18:20:00,394," Wow John please tell your som Matt a big thank you for the offer.  I will swing by Best Buy on my way home and scratch another thing of of my list.  So now I just have to sit and wait 7 more long days, till we will actually need it.  Thank you,   FLEX"
479233,mistaredone,2010-06-25 00:03:00,913,Fm transmitters suck!  I've bought cheep ones and $148 Monster top quality ones with same result. If you love music you need an aux plug.
