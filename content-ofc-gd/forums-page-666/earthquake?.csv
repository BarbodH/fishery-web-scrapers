478746,blaque,2010-06-23 20:57:00,2419,"got nothing here in lockport NY area, despite having reports all over the area of feeling the quake. hmmmm"
478752,highdrifter,2010-06-23 21:17:00,2534,Was staring at my fish tank when it happened..  My cichlids sure felt it!  Our precambrian shield is aging..  Could this be a sign of things to come?!
478770,Leecher,2010-06-23 22:07:00,7832, Leechman's personal log **** Star date twenty-three dot zero six dot ten.....  strongest tremor felt to date.... was working at a client's site and all hell broke loose.... first reaction..... get the Hell out as quick as possible.  Location 3rd floor.....  No damage reported but one hell of a scary moment.... lasted what seemed to be an eternity     Building was closed and people were sent home. End log *****  This one hit pretty close to home.... Buckingham which is about 20 minute drive on highway 50 from where I live..... glad to report that all is well and no damage of sort to report  Leechman
478782,Jer,2010-06-23 22:51:00,1426,"I was at the office in Peterborough when I thought a truck had hit the building, except there was no bang, and then there was another shake. The ""Health & Safety Committee"" decided we should leave the building which I think was a little extreme. From the parking lot I was looking to the southwest and northwest to see if the G-20 or G-8 had got nuked.  For half an hour or more afterwards, I guess the cell phone circuits were jammed with traffic. I couldn't make a call for the life of me. Makes you wonder how effective our little electronic crutches would be if crap really hit the fan."
478784,[email protected],2010-06-23 22:58:00,15,"  Felt it in markham too, was writing my final exam when it happened"
478793,canuckjack,2010-06-23 23:24:00,121,Felt that loud in clear at work in Ottawa.  We were evacuated and sent home for the day as a precautionary measure while they inspect our buildings.  So I strolled over to the local watering hole had a pint while waiting for the Mrs. to pick me up.
478896,GBW,2010-06-24 04:06:00,8460,"Because the PUB is the best built building around, I swear..."
478933,Tarzan's Jane,2010-06-24 11:20:00,1183,Getting out of the city was interesting.   Kinda makes you wonder how we all will fair in a true emergency/catastrophe.  I believe this is our rehearsal.  We can't suck the blood out of the veins of Mother Earth without something happening....
478939,lew,2010-06-24 11:35:00,12766, Earthquakes are just as natural as sunrises & rainbows.  If we decide to build our homes on fault lines we need to be ready for some shaking every once in awhile.
478947,doubleheader,2010-06-24 11:48:00,497,"We felt it here in NW PA. A number of folks called the news stations from Erie, Warren, Bradford. I'm not sure where the fault line runs, does anyone know? My recollection is it runs down thru the Niagara region kind of SW to NE and that it's one of the bigger fault lines."
478970,Spiel,2010-06-24 12:31:00,9065,"  Read this, this morning.   ""The epicentre of the quake is located on an active fault known as the West Quebec Seismic Zone, a region Godin describes as one of the more quake-prone regions in the country."" Hamilton Spectator   "
479011,doubleheader,2010-06-24 14:00:00,497," I was speaking with my insurance agent yesterday, getting paperwork ready to show proof of insurance for my upcoming trip to the west arm. So I asked her if my homerowners policy covered earthquake damage, and I learned it doesn't I and they can't even add it if there has been any seismic activity withing the last 7 days. I think I might just add it when I get back. It's less than $40/year."
479019,wallyboss,2010-06-24 14:26:00,1095,I read something last night that really opened my eyes.  It seems like that fault line has an earthquake at least every 5 days. Most are not noticeable but earthquakes nonetheless.
479099,pike n' whities,2010-06-24 17:44:00,131,felt 'er up here in Sault Ste. Marie too! I thought it was just my dog and cat knockin things down again...... that's the last time I try and jam stuff onto a shelf.
479195,OhioFisherman,2010-06-24 21:54:00,6623,"It was on the news here in Ohio also, lol since Stevie (PigeonFisher) slimmed down and moved south we can`t blame it on him falling? Some huge salt mines under the Great Lakes, and with the disaster in the gulf I have to wonder, what happens if a quake fractures the roof of one of them? It would be sort of nice to see the great lakes stay freshwater?  LOL I am sure they have an emergency plan? Too like save the Walruses?"
478656,Lunker777,2010-06-23 18:11:00,866,"Felt it here in Chatham !!!! The funny thing about it is, I was on the phone with a customer west of Ottawa and he went silent in the middle of our conversation.... I asked if he was still there and he says "" Ya, they are blasting sewers about 3 miles from my place and one just shook my truck !! "" hahah I said oh yea ??? thats crazy..... then we went on with our convo and about 2 minutes later... I went silent  ! hahaha All of a sudden i felt like i was drunk rockin back and forth and the displays in the show room were shaking !!!!"
478657,torco,2010-06-23 18:14:00,656,Felt it out here in Guelph.
478660,fishindude,2010-06-23 18:17:00,220,"Started rocking on the chair here in Vaughan, very erie!  Epicentre is believed to be in Quebec, will there be tremors?"
478661,ccmtcanada,2010-06-23 18:17:00,7971,"From the Toronto Star Website  People in Toronto are reporting feeling tremors at about 1:45 p.m. today. Workers in office buildings reported feeling the buildings shake.  ""It felt like the building was swaying,"" said Alex Carter, who works in a tower at Bloor and Yonge Sts.   In Ottawa, dozens of members of the national press gallery poured out onto the streets across from Parliament Hill as a tremor shook the National Press Building. Public servants and political staffers also began to empty their offices as the realization set in.  The tremors shook for about 30 seconds.  The U.S. Geological Survey reported this afternoon that the quake was 5.5 on the Richter scale, and was centred on the Ontario-Quebec border 19 kilometres deep."
478662,solopaddler,2010-06-23 18:18:00,8605,I'm currently at work at the weather office in Hamilton. I work in the base of the control tower and the controllers almost evacuated when it happened.  Personally I thought I was having a heart attack LOL!  My compadre from Environment Canada was sitting beside me and he said the closest fault line is in the middle of Lake Ontario.  Apparantly it's a filled with contaminated sludge from the Love Canal.  Hopefully the quake didn't disturb too much of that crap (if that was indeed the epicentre).
478666,xpedx789,2010-06-23 18:21:00,11,Felt it in Cleveland !
478670,lew,2010-06-23 18:23:00,12766,I live on a dirt road and was driving along it while listening to the quake report on Peterboro radio but didn't feel anything..... Gotta luv the suspension on an F-150  I got home a couple minutes later and my wife said everything was shaking in the house.
478671,alexcba,2010-06-23 18:23:00,634,"weird, felt nothing in etobicoke."
