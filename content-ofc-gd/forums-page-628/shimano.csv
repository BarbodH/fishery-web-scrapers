506975,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-09-26 13:13:00,0,You have to check the classifieds regularly. Shimanos usually sell quickly. I picked up one and was slow on another 2. Plus I was slow on some awesome rod deals.
506987,timmeh,2010-09-26 14:14:00,609,Check ebay. That will give you more options since you can ship it in. There are some good deals to be had from time to time.
506988,walleyejack,2010-09-26 14:18:00,358,I been checking ebay and kijiji. all they have to offer that i have seen are kind of cheap reels. Thanks anyway Al
