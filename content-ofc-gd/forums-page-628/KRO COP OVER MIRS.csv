506944,chessy,2010-09-26 04:47:00,610,mir knocks out cro cop... with a nice knee to the jaw
506945,BillM,2010-09-26 04:58:00,17367,"Man, that fight sucked regardless of the ending."
507071,steverowbotham,2010-09-26 22:07:00,1800,"yea pretty dissapointing card all together. Stephens / Guillard was still entertaining but could have been WAY better Serra / Lytle was pretty awesome Dunham / Sherk again, was pretty awesome and Dunham got robbed big time Nogueira / Bader was dissappointing, judges made the right call with Bader Mir / Cro Cop was terrible.  I miss the old Mirko!"
507380,PainInTheBass,2010-09-27 20:21:00,102,"I pretty much agree with all of that.  I want my money back.  The Mir/Cro Cop fight reminded me of Kimbo and Houston Alexander.  They danced for nearly 15 minutes.  Serra/Lytle was pretty bad ass.  I am not a Serra fan, but man, can he take some punishment!  There is no way that Sherk should have gotten that decision, with a 30-27 no less.  I didn't think you could award all 3 rounds to a fighter based on a cut he gave his opponent in the first round."
507383,Terry,2010-09-27 20:29:00,14456,yeah the best night of fighting
