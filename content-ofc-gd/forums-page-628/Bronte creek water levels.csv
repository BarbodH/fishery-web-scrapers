506656,fishinguypat,2010-09-25 01:25:00,547,with a yak you can fish the sanctuary area? lucky
506669,Guest LivingLegend,2010-09-25 02:05:00,0,"  Good question, buddy was there so we are gonna try it out, can u find fish at the sanctuary in a yak??"
506677,sauce,2010-09-25 02:32:00,219,"You are not allowed to fish in a sanctuary. So please stop refering to that stretch of the creek as a sanctuary. It used to be a sanctuary. Shore access is non existant. It can be fished from a boat, inner tube, kayak or canoe. Build a raft huck finn style and giver."
506693,Guest LivingLegend,2010-09-25 03:10:00,0,"  Hmm yet on the MNR site they still refer to it as a sanctuary and gives u the details on its no fishing dates. Why is it that u cant fish from shore? Private property? Good thing a got that yak, time to attack!"
506699,fishinguypat,2010-09-25 03:49:00,547,ok so its not a sanctuary anymore
506702,sauce,2010-09-25 04:00:00,219,"Ask the town of oakville why you aren't allowed to fish from shore there. I think its because they see the mess in petro park and don't want it happening elsewhere. That's a good enough reason in my books. As for the sanctuary, not sure of the reason for opening that section up. But we are now allowed to fish for trout and salmon from lake o all the way up to 407 till dec 31."
506717,Guest LivingLegend,2010-09-25 09:28:00,0,It states that there is no fishing at the sanctuary from Oct.1 to Dec 31. Its time to see if they are hungry.............L8R.
506878,Stern Rules,2010-09-25 22:33:00,342,I was there last week and you can only walk up so far. There was a pipeline leak in March and they have the creek blocked off before the train bridge. They have some sand bags set up in one spot and pumps and a lot of wells drilled to try to clean up the contaminated soil and water.
