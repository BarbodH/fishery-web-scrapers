506676,Dutch,2010-09-25 02:28:00,831,"Terrible avoidable tragedy.  Hotfoot should be standard on every bass boat.  IT would have at least slowed the boat to idle when the driver's foot came off.  Still, the kill switch is fool proof."
506731,fish_fishburn,2010-09-25 12:06:00,1311,I agree with Dutch. Maybe the bass clubs should institute a new rule stating that all bassboats fishing  their tournaments must have a hotfoot installed.
506732,Terry,2010-09-25 12:10:00,14456,in all the tourneys I fished in canada a kill switch and the cord attached to the driver is mandatory  can't believe every tourney doesn't do the same
506735,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-09-25 12:37:00,0," Agreed. Every boat that goes over a certain speed(especially tournament boats), should have a hotfoot."

506785,NBR,2010-09-25 15:37:00,163, I disagree on the hot foot. I have a nerve problem in my right leg and can't hold it in the same position for very long. I do fasten the kill switch every time I start the big engins. I think hooking up the kill switch should be the same as putting on your seat belt.
