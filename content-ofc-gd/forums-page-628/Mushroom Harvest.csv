506632,Dozer,2010-09-25 00:24:00,896,"Well, 'tis the season.  Been cleaning mushrooms for the last 6 hours which were harvested this morning.  So many mushrooms we had to stop picking them.  Back to the cutting board, not looking forward to back pain tomorrow but its well worth it.  Anyone else finding unusally high numbers of 'shrooms this year?  We've been twice so far and hitting some serious loads, todays hunt yeilded 5 bucket fulls ( between two people ) of superb quality, fresh, firm fungi.  The weekenders are sure going to be disappointed, haha."
506642,Muskieman,2010-09-25 00:53:00,2472,I don't know them enough to pick and eat them.. but I have notice a lot up here....  Randy

506647,Sinker,2010-09-25 01:06:00,8692,What kind are you finding?
506701,Paudash,2010-09-25 03:59:00,273,This is something I have always wanted to learn about as I love food.  I did notice a lot more this year
506749,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-09-25 13:53:00,0,the only time i ever picked mushrooms i spent 8 hours staring at the tiles on my kitchen floor...
506751,fishing n autograph,2010-09-25 14:00:00,2540, did you hear colours and see sounds??? good ol' synesthesia!
506758,Mahumba,2010-09-25 14:25:00,28,Staring at the tiles on the kitchen floor. My God I can remember doing that. I'm sitting here laughing at that comment!  Imagine taking those now? I would end up flipping right out.  Roger
506764,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-09-25 14:37:00,0,"there's definitely reasons i don't ""pick mushrooms"" anymore.  i like the looks of my tiles just the way they are!"
506815,Gerritt,2010-09-25 17:51:00,6129,for some reason.... mushrooms and ice fishing seem to go hand in hand... not that I have ever tried it...  G
506867,fish_fishburn,2010-09-25 21:36:00,1311,They say the best ones grow in the western provinces.
506868,hunterjoe84,2010-09-25 21:37:00,52,however there are 5 known species that grow in ontario.
506875,kickingfrog,2010-09-25 22:15:00,8333,"For as hot a summer as we had in central/southern Ontario, we also had a very wet summer. I would think that would help the crop."
506888,misfish,2010-09-25 23:21:00,29133,Honey mushrooms.Yum.
506900,dave524,2010-09-25 23:58:00,4508,"The only ones I trust myslf with are puffballs, sliced and fried they are very good."
506908,aplumma,2010-09-26 00:58:00,6896,I went to an ethnic store that specializes in Asian ingredients and found a 20 lb bag of sliced and dried shittake mushrooms for $56.00.How long will that amount last your average mushroom ?  Art
506938,keram,2010-09-26 03:17:00,585,I do it every year  for as long as I can remember Some of them 
507063,bare foot wader,2010-09-26 21:42:00,1354, haha...isn't that true  anybody ever hear of fire morels?  grow in coniferous forests but they explode in burn paths following the 1-2 yrs after a fire....I'm not the biggest fan of shrooms in my food but these things are amazing and if you can't find any to pick IMO worth splurging at least once in your life to try them at a restaurant
507079,lew,2010-09-26 22:43:00,12766,"Don't know what they are but I've had them popping up all over the place in the last week or so. I've seen them grow up to 6"" high practically overnite.    "
507080,danbouck,2010-09-26 22:44:00,4380,I noticed about a dozen growing in the sand at the cottage yesterday.
507280,canadadude,2010-09-27 16:08:00,769,"Picked a couple of bags this morning, lots around this year, walked about 50yds into the bush and the stumps are just covered could fill the back of a pick-up if I went through the whole bush."
507370,ehg,2010-09-27 19:53:00,2666,"Honey mushrooms are like N. American shitakkes. Very fine edibles!  Many, many excellent mushrooms to be found with a little research. Chantrelles are abundant and found in the early fall. Also Black Trumpets, Ceps, Sweet Tooth, Blewit and on and on this time of year."
