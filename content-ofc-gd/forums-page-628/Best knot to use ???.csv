506385,Lunker777,2010-09-24 15:26:00,866,"Hey everyone  I want to tie 30# Trilene ""big game"" to some leaders a fellow OFC'er tied up for me.  The have a Snap I need to tie to.... what would be the best knot to use ? I will be musky fishing with the set up !  Thanks for any help !"
506395,SlowPoke,2010-09-24 15:48:00,2984,"I use a nail knot for almost everything. Line splices (any diameter), terminal connections, snelled hooks. Simply put, a very versitile knot, non-slip with braid and amongst the stongest."
506396,Lunker777,2010-09-24 15:51:00,866,Its not braid Im using though... its Mono I believe ? hahah I like to use braid but was talked out of it when I bought these new reels...
506399,SlowPoke,2010-09-24 15:59:00,2984,It's good for all lines but is especially good for braid vs. the commen clinch knot which has a tendancy to slip.  Watch the video http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5b5b_32Cexs
506401,Lunker777,2010-09-24 16:12:00,866,is the nail knot only for tieing 2 pieces of line together  ???
506405,SlowPoke,2010-09-24 16:18:00,2984," LOL!!! ver·sa·tile   (vûr'sə-təl, -tīl'): adj. Capable of doing many things competently. Having varied uses or serving many functions.  I use it for everything except drop shothooks. -Tying off swivels -Tying off hooks, trailer hooks, snelled hooks, harnesses -Line splices of any diameter (braid/mono/fluoro/wire/leadcore)"
506406,lookinforwalleye,2010-09-24 16:22:00,4399,I like the Trilene knot!!
506413,Lunker777,2010-09-24 16:39:00,866,hahahah ok... so what your telling me... is i can use this to tie on my leaders ???  Just playin !!! thanks slowpoke !! Check your PM
506415,walleyejack,2010-09-24 16:47:00,358,"but then again, anyone cheering for Habs would like any knot !  "
506423,SlowPoke,2010-09-24 17:11:00,2984," Ohhhh, you want to tie on leaders? Then, no."
506426,tknohpy,2010-09-24 17:18:00,162,palomar
506427,Guest JPCT,2010-09-24 17:21:00,0,Palomar and Improved clinch.  Davy knot is good too
506430,Leecher,2010-09-24 17:26:00,7832,Uni would be your best knot for tying leaders..... I use it all the time  Uni Knot Animated Leechman
506609,spincast,2010-09-24 23:52:00,3279,"perfection knot, with a swivel on the leader.  The leader knot would depend on the weight of the leader. Then you can switch out leaders and lures with snap- literally."
506670,Vanselena,2010-09-25 02:08:00,269,"Palomar for terminal or florida no name knot for splice of same type of line, eg. mono to mono. Use a small swivel when tying different types of line."
506680,Carp,2010-09-25 02:37:00,1488,I use a palomar knot for most applications.
506686,HTHM,2010-09-25 02:49:00,4082,"Whatever knot you are happy with, it seems to be the theme of the replies to this thread."
506687,ld17,2010-09-25 02:50:00,319,I recommend the surgeons knot.  Very easy to tie braid to mono or any other leader.  I've been using it all year and have not had the knot slip once.  But I did like the video for the nail knot.
506912,adempsey,2010-09-26 01:04:00,1498,"Palomar Improved Clinch [i personally thread the line through twice at the start].  http://www.netknots.com/html/fishing_knots.html  According to this article, the San Diego Jam knot is the strongest terminal knot (of those they tested): http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_7535/is_200902/ai_n32328791/  Of course, the Fish'n'Fool knot won Knot Wars 2009 and the Berkley Braid knot won Knot Wars 2010."
506913,Kinger,2010-09-26 01:13:00,351,"I like uni-uni for leaders. Rapala knot and improved clinch for lures, palomar for hooks."
506917,Muskieman,2010-09-26 01:41:00,2472,"At the rate that I change and tie on lures lately, I use a bow.  Depends on what I'm using... Jig or Single = *Noose or Fisherman Cranks        = Rapala Knot or Bolen Leader        = Uni or Nail  ** (not a) (kinda like a) Noose ... actual name of this knot was on the board a few weeks ago.
