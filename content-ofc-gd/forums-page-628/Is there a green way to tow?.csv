506756,Shaun Rickard,2010-09-25 14:22:00,144,"I found this intersting article and thought you guys might be interested. The piece talks about how we can have less impact on the environment while enjoying outdoor activities that include tow vehicles.  Is there a green way to tow?  Cheers, Shaun"
506757,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-09-25 14:24:00,0, I'm not sure about green tow but battery run boats would be a great idea. Do you know how much gasoline a boat spews in the water?
506809,Fisherman,2010-09-25 17:33:00,7201,"Going green..maybe send this to the bass pros that run around in those 250HP boats at breakneck speed, stop, then roar off to the next spot..talk about a waste of resources."
506817,lookinforwalleye,2010-09-25 17:53:00,4399," I was thinking the same thing,but there are plenty of weekender`s that do the same thing!  For the most part for the kind of fishing I do I could probably get by with 14 foot jon boat and a small 4 stroke heck I could probably tow it with my Subaru but instead I have a big gas guzzing V8 for the 2 times I towed my boat this year."
506818,scugpg,2010-09-25 17:55:00,1373," That said, someone with a 15hp 1970's 2 stroke leaking & burning oil could possibly do much more harm than those guys."
506820,Fisherman,2010-09-25 17:57:00,7201,"The oil sludge, yes, but I think those big motors would take just a few more drops of gas than a 15hp."

506866,fish_fishburn,2010-09-25 21:33:00,1311,theres a reason for a 3/8 fuel line on a big V6. And it aint got anything to do with green
506874,Whitespinnerbait,2010-09-25 21:59:00,2038,  Nice come back right there.  Anyway  Bass Boats Rule...its just the way it is
506890,Fisherman,2010-09-25 23:30:00,7201,"Never ever seen a bass boat go downrigging, but then again, those bass don't really get anywhere near the size of a salmon."
506893,Bernie,2010-09-25 23:34:00,3190," I'm not sure Johnny, care to enlighten me?"
506972,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-09-26 13:04:00,0, Simple. TOO MUCH!
506991,dave524,2010-09-26 14:43:00,4508," there was a time when it was 150 hp. max for tournies, might be time to go back"
506994,aplumma,2010-09-26 15:18:00,6896,  Do you feel enlightened now Bernie?   You got to give a mechanic a better answer than that John if you want to continue the debate.   Art
506996,bdox,2010-09-26 15:23:00,329, Almost positive the 40lb salmon caught in the first week of the derby was caught from a bass boat.
507004,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-09-26 15:44:00,0," There is no debate. If anyone looks at the water around their engine, it is clear there is gasoline being dumped into the water. This is just at idle. As boat traffic continues to increase(and size of engines), so will the amount of gasoline. I don't think that is good for the vegetation, wildlife or fish.  Although technology has been compensating? I think technology can do a bit more."
507012,Bernie,2010-09-26 16:43:00,3190,"No debate? OK, if you say so JB. Some minds are too closed to listen anyway."
507049,aplumma,2010-09-26 19:13:00,6896,"The majority of the motors that have been manufactured in the last 5 years actually have lower emissions than your car. This is of course a properly maintained engine with no fuel leaks before it is burned. I have a 1989 Johnson 150 that when I bought it was a great source of pollution and it sickened me but after replacing the fuel lines, rebuilding the carburetors,replacing the ignition system and adjusting it the outcome is a very clean fast running boat. It is not as clean as the new motors with computer controls and fuel injection but the price was right and it is more economical than the big boat with twin 318's.   Art"
507050,danbouck,2010-09-26 19:43:00,4380, I invite you to come check the water around my engine
507056,Whitespinnerbait,2010-09-26 20:08:00,2038, Thats what life's all about right there...
507119,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-09-27 00:35:00,0, Listen to what? I've owned a boat and been in many boats.  There is no question that engines pollute our waters. And like I said. I would like to see some eco friendly(possibly battery operated) motors. You have a problem with that?
507177,Twocoda,2010-09-27 02:57:00,4130,ive heard of green thumbs   ...but never green tows
507202,Fisherman,2010-09-27 11:18:00,7201,Green tows..leave your wet boots on long enough and you'll have green tows....
