That was Friday, the wet weather and clouds on Saturday seem to bring out the walleye    ....and the fry pan shots....   one largemouth  and these guys dropped in to see if the fish were in the river  alot of this  and not enough this  a very good time looking forward to next year!"

The fish were caught mostly on a simple jig and minnow, or just a minnow on a hook with a split shot. Good times......"
