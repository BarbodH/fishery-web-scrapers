506027,Andy,2010-09-23 14:55:00,330,"I will have an opportunity to fish Mississauga Lake NE of Bobcaygeon in the coming week. I have never been and have a few general questions. Any idea what is available re; species? I assume both types of bass, and I've heard lake trout, but what about pike and/or musky? Am I correct in assuming it has the potential for pickeral on shoals, similar to the north end of Pigeon, Lovesick and Stony? My GPS doesn't have a map for it. Any idea of there if maps are available at nearby stores? Any thoughts would be appreciated. Andy"
