506630,FlyGuy5,2010-09-25 00:20:00,101,Hit up the Ganny a couple of weeks ago after a good rain checked out the river on my way home from work to see nothing but black due how many salmon were in the river.  I ran home grabbed my fly rod and ran back to the river.  Using brown body and pink and orange head eggsucking leaches I was able to hook fish after fish.  Fishing along the seams of the fast water I was able to hook into a few little Jack's and 2 very nice coho which were by far the catch of the day!!

To be honest, in the rivers I actually prefer fishing Cohos, they seem to get further upriver in better shape than Kings, more willing to hit especially the males and more acrobatic when hooked. Good shooting"
