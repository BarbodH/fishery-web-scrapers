506922,ch312,2010-09-26 01:54:00,1590,"as posted on 6-8...  due to the heavy winds and chance of rain i was iffy about headin out today in my little 14 ft tinner. but, at 10am i finally decided to head down to old cut and was on the water by 1130am. headed straight east and marked a school and anchored. non stop action for an hour and then nothing. nothing again by ec 10 and over by the crowd. nothing by the next markers east. headed back towards old cut to 6-7ft and non stop action again. i was putting half a minnow on each hook and went through 3 scoops by 6pm.  most of the larger fish were caught on a 2 hook drop shot rig with a red hook down low and chartreuse up top. i always have much better luck using colored hooks and some days they prefer different colors. pickerel rig brought in more fish, but they were mostly smaller fish.  average for the day was probably 10-11"" fish with very few under 9"". 90% of the fish were females with eggs. i thought they spawned in the spring?

507014,Fisherman,2010-09-26 16:49:00,7201,"Beat ya to it, went in to Barrie this morning, sat on my folding chair, launched a Berkley gulp a few times, no action, fed that to a seagull and went with the small 1"" perch coloured Slurpee, bingo..just finished a couple of Perchwiches. After numerous tries, Berkley Gulp has found a new resting place, in the garbage..stinky @#*#."
507053,misfish,2010-09-26 19:52:00,29133,Lots of people down there today.Crazy. Barrie should hold a perchfest here in the fall.Great revenue for the city.
507064,Fisherman,2010-09-26 21:44:00,7201,"Don't go there...you know those twits in ESSA make you pay to fish the river, all in the name of garbage clean up, yada, yada. Next thing every municipality will be charging extra. Look at Innisfil with their retarded parking prices at IBP."
507074,steverowbotham,2010-09-26 22:10:00,1800,"they do spawn in the spring, but eggs begin development much before that."
507086,Leecher,2010-09-26 23:24:00,7832,Awesome ch312 Sounds like a good time Leechman
