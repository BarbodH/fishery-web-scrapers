505637,Fisherpete,2010-09-22 02:23:00,1814,"Not much time tonight to write a novel, but here is a quick rundown of yesterday's outing...  Conditions for most of the day - glass calm and sunny. Yech. Led to Al's spaghetti ski. She was 42.5"", and probably 7 pounds. Rounding up. LOL! She was a hurtin' unit, but at least she was trying to eat something!  #102   Guess what happened at the end up the day when just a LITTLE bit of chop came to the water? The meatballs. They are definitely starting to pack on some pounds...  #103   #104   Thanks Al for not leaving when you wanted to... that last hour saved the day for me!"
505642,Nipfisher,2010-09-22 02:25:00,2449,That is one sickly looking fish.
505652,ctdd2006,2010-09-22 02:38:00,531,That first fish needs a big mac or two!  The last two sure are getting chubby!  You're my hero
505654,SRT8 smoker craft,2010-09-22 02:41:00,1107,that first ski needs a chicken carcass LOL other 2 are nice!!
505684,solopaddler,2010-09-22 09:08:00,8605,I'm beginning to dread opening your posts. Serious esox envy here.  That first fish is either sick or dying of old age.
505696,corvette1,2010-09-22 11:35:00,1765,nice skis congrats
505699,Rod Caster,2010-09-22 11:45:00,5784,half eel/half musky
505703,Gregoire,2010-09-22 12:06:00,1397,Looks like a good day. Some of the fall ski's are getting pretty fat. Your 50 incher has got to be comming soon.
505704,Joey,2010-09-22 12:09:00,9122,"Man, that poor first musky, he needs some food and love  The other ones are nice and healthy, way to go Peter  Joey"
505729,muskeybugged,2010-09-22 14:51:00,282,Poor little guy.... I don't think he stands a chance making it through the winter..... Did you share your lunch with him?  The other two are gorgeous
505856,Rizzo,2010-09-23 00:18:00,4754,"I won't be able to sleep tonight after seeing that first fish...nasty. The other two look ready for winter already, packing on some good pounds. Another great report!"
505936,PikeMolester,2010-09-23 03:01:00,428,what the hell is wrong with that first one?
506105,jbailey,2010-09-23 18:24:00,866,damn that first one is uggglyy those other 2 are gorgeous tho congrats i dont know how you do it!
506187,muskymatt,2010-09-23 21:58:00,2608,  It's a leaf fan......hasn't had anything to feed on since '67  Couple good looking sens fans though...
506438,Leecher,2010-09-24 17:51:00,7832,"Is the first one anorexic or what Some nice couple of ""meatballs"" as you say Pete  Question:  Ever thought of tagging the muskys you catch since you've caught so many? Leechman"
506538,Fisherpete,2010-09-24 21:46:00,1814,"I would gladly participate in a tagging program... I intend to join Muskies Canada in the near future, maybe I could get steered in the right direction there."
506552,fishing n autograph,2010-09-24 22:21:00,2540,looks like that ski had gastric bypass surgery....gross
506778,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-09-25 15:23:00,0,WOW! I bet that Musky just recently lost some jewelry( a lure stuck in his mouth).......Hopefully he/she's ok. It looks like a survivor.  Some nice musky and I know that spot anywhere!!Great spot!
