506259,perchslayer666,2010-09-24 00:39:00,280,"I recall reading his posts on the Simco board, and keeping everyone on the board up to date with his battle with Throat Cancer. Very sad news, cause it seemed like he was doing good, and on the path to a full recovery.  Just curious, but was he a smoker?  At least the guy will be fishin in paradise for eternity. RIP Slytv"
506260,icefisherman,2010-09-24 00:40:00,952,What a nice guy Shane was! Fished with him on hard and soft water...always fun always pleasure to be near him. Helped every one and was ready to help anyone. Wish the best to his family...you can be proud with him!  Ice Fisherman
506287,Joey,2010-09-24 02:32:00,9122,"Wow, what terrible news.  Very sorry to hear this.  I met Shane several times on Simcoe and he was always very helpful and friendly.  The world lost a great one  My condolances to Donna and family.  Joey"
506288,NAW,2010-09-24 02:34:00,4022,"The first time I met sly was at a ice fishing tournament.  We where competing against each other.  He couldn't speak at that point in his life.  But he sat there for a 1/2 hour writing on a peace of paper telling how I could catch a ling that would win me the tournament..  We have lost a true gentleman today.  It's really is sad.  But as others have noted, not unexpeted.  This week, I have lost to freids to Cancer, one of which was only 21 years old.  Sad week.."
506298,crappieperchhunter,2010-09-24 04:34:00,2582,"First time I met Shane I got to Sibbald and the early ice was pretty sketchy..so I set up my fish trap in shallow and started fishing. Then I see this skinny guy with a spud doing the chip, step, chip step...and man he went a way out there...and there was VERY VERY little ice. It started to rain and I waved him over to my trap pro to sit inside and try to wait it out. We chatted a bit and then the rain slowed down and he got back at it. That evening he gave a report on the Simcoe board and used the chip, step...chip, chip, step in his post and to this day whenever I see someone doing the chip step to check the ice I think of Shane that morning at Sibbald.  I can't think of a single soul who was more helpful to other fishermen then this man.  A tragic loss for all of us who knew Shane or fished  Simcoe.  My heartfelt condolences to his many friends and family."
506329,Tdel,2010-09-24 12:54:00,393,I never met Sly but I frequently go to the Simcoe message board and have been doing so for years. I first learned about the man there.  I could tell from all the posts that he was great guy and a truly Good Samaritan. He was always there when people needed help no matter what and for the last few years he was the glue that held the Simcoe board together.  I am sure Shane never knew how many hearts he really touched.  My deepest sympathies and condolences to Donna and family.  Tom
506541,Fisherpete,2010-09-24 22:00:00,1814,"As many of you have already mentioned, Shane was one of the most helpful and knowledgeable guys out there. I had the pleasure of fishing with Shane once on open water, and a bunch of times on the ice. Here's how I met him - it pretty much sums up what a nice guy he was.  Probably seven or eight years ago, LONG BEFORE I WAS ON OFC (lol) I used to frequent the Lake Simcoe Message Board... and one fall, I posted a question on where my brother and I could rent a boat for the day to go perching. Shane sends me a PM moments later with his phone number, and the message ""Call Me"". I did, and he simply said: ""Rent a boat? Nah. You and yer bro get up here and let's go. I'll show you where the perch are in Virginia Beach."" I was shocked - it sounded too good to be true! But we went, had a blast, and Shane and I fished together a number of times on the ice after that at some of the outings that board held. He was always the first guy to help out if somebody needed a rescue, and the first to test the thickness of the Simcoe ice every winter. Fishing rod on the ice??? Jigging stick and a Williams, or you are a wuss...  You will be missed bud... tight lines up there."
506579,wormdunker,2010-09-24 23:01:00,1711,My condolences to Shanes family.  Although I never met him I feel very sad to loose such a special person. Brian
506653,fishdawg,2010-09-25 01:15:00,912,"Shane ""guided"" me & Bricknblock (Peter) one march day in 2006...  took us out in the old ""tonka truck"" and hauled us around to a few spots over the day trying to get us on the whiteys  ive herd many fine stories about him over the years.... he certainly lived hard, worked hard & played hard & has now left us too earlyRIP Shane, condolences to the family, friends & buddies"
506654,mukluk,2010-09-25 01:20:00,196,"Sure going to miss seeing Sly out on the ice.  He was always there if you needed any info on Lake Simcoe conditions.  As far as I see it there will aways be a ""Slyville"" out there.  Rest in peace Shane."
506662,wuchikubo,2010-09-25 01:35:00,1114,"I met Shane once about 5 years ago when I had just got back into ice fishing. Definitely a great guy, he even went out of his way to try and locate my short lived portable hut that got blown away one January spring thaw.  Shane, may you rest in peace, you will be missed by many.  Stan"
506665,speckchaser,2010-09-25 01:48:00,17,"As with many others here I never had the pleasure to meet Shane in person. I used to go throgh all the posts on the Simcoe board to see what he was catching and possibly where he was catching them. I had the oppoutunity to add Shane on my Yahoo friends list and I would send him messages whenever  I saw that his I.D.was lit up. They went unanswered for the most part, but then on night he replied back. We chatted for about an hour telling fishing stories,(his were way better than mine),he finally told me he was tired and needed to sleep to build up some strenght to fight the illness.As we were signing off he told me to stop by and we would hit the lake amd do some fishing. I truely regret not being able to make time this summer for that outing. RIP Shane, it was good to know you even in our limited way.......FISH ON!!!!!!"
506671,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-09-25 02:09:00,0,Yup. Heard nothing but good things about Sly. It really sucks when they die so young.....  My condolences to Shane's family and friends.
506742,brickNblock,2010-09-25 12:56:00,598,"Sly....Never to Be Forgotten my freind!  Our condolences Donna and to the Family.. Distance made getting together difficult these past 5 years but Shane, you were never far from thought. I know you'll have peace now..To one of the most thoroughly giving people one will ever know!  Peter & Charmaine..."
506831,Beans,2010-09-25 19:20:00,3339,"Only met Shane once, Big Cliff and I were to meet Chevy and Shelley at the end of Sally Anne Road but there was a large crack they had to go around so Chevy asked Shane (via cellphone) to show us the way out to Slyville and they would meet us out there...Like Big Cliff said about Shane...""what a nice young man!""...R.I.P. Mate"
507069,BillM,2010-09-26 22:03:00,17367,"Never met him, but fished a certain spot out on Lake Simcoe last year that was dubbed 'Slyville'  I'm sure that name will be given the the hot spots for years to come..  Nice tribute if you ask me.  RIP."

506131,spoon,2010-09-23 19:28:00,74,"wow, I'm shocked. Very sad day.  Rest in peace Shane."
506147,SylvanOwner,2010-09-23 20:09:00,266,Only knew the man from reading the Lake Simcoe board but clearly a real class act.  Rest in peace.
506149,Spiel,2010-09-23 20:14:00,9065,I'm truly saddened by this news.  While I never met Shane we had talked via the net on a number of occasions. I had hoped to share my boat with him one day on Simcoe but sadly that opportunity has now passed.  My sincerest condolences to Shane's family and his many friends.
506172,Ron,2010-09-23 21:06:00,1683,"It is always terrible news to hear when a fellow angler passes away. I'm sure Shane is now into the trophies of Perch, Lakers and Whitiefish, all day long. Rest in peace dear friend, rest in peace."
506173,cityfisher,2010-09-23 21:12:00,959,Very sad.... great guy.. Had the pleasure of fishing with him a couple times on simcoe.  RIP

506214,danbouck,2010-09-23 23:17:00,4380,I never met him but heard nothing but great things about him  condolences to the family
506222,misfish,2010-09-23 23:36:00,29133,"Maybe add when you met Shane.  Although I only met him a few times on the water, both hard and soft,I still remember the first time. It was at a Simcoe board ice fishing M&G. The Simcoe board had put out an open invite to the OFC group to meet up, out off the 7th line. Here I got meet others like, Simcoe Bob and Big Jim ,Rybak,Chevy and many others. It was close to the finish of the day and here comes this bad ass 4x4 from the south/east. I thought to myself,what a crazy MTF. This little guy jumps out and is greeted by many. I was more interested in the truck then the driver. I thought he was a little off.   Boy was I wrong.He was just one of those ,,,,,,,Lets say, one of those Canadian redneck guys.  The last time I seen him was with Andy out for some whities in my old bass boat.Remember that Andy.You knew Sly was out there."
506223,vinnimon,2010-09-23 23:38:00,2593,RIP SLY  
506229,ch312,2010-09-23 23:44:00,1590,i met him up at a lake simcoe message board meet and greet probably 5 years ago or so. although we didnt talk much it was very easy to tell from online conversations that he was a great guy and would help anyone.  RIP
506237,pikehunter,2010-09-24 00:00:00,1659,I'm very saddened by the news. Like Spiel I had always intended to visit him on Simcoe or drop in so I could meet him in person. We had conversed many times a few years ago on the internet or email and sadly I have let the opportunity to meet with him pass. Someday Shane we may have the chance to meet spiritualy.  All the best to the family and I'm sure your spirit will fish Simcoe's waters for ever more. R.I.P.
506251,Sinker,2010-09-24 00:19:00,8692,"I'm getting sick of losing friends to cancer.  Sly was a great guy. First time I met him, we were stuck in a truck out on simcoe. There was a foot and a half of snow, in a white out, with 6"" of slush. NASTY. We had all the gear to get unstuck, but Shane stuck it out with us and made sure we got to shore. He'd  give you the shirt off his back in a blizzard......and take nothing in return..........just the kind of guy he was.  Another time we got up to the lake, and forgot our helmets at home. No prob, Sly hooked us up, and we got out for the day.  Seen him come running out of a burning ice hut one time too.........crazy bugger!!  You won't meet a nicer guy, with more passion for fishing.  A major loss to the icefishing community around lake simcoe. Full of great, real time info on conditions, and always willing to help out.  RIP Shane, your going to be missed by many. I'm sure there will be many great stories with your name mentioned on the ice this winter, and for many more to come!  S."
