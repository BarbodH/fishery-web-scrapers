506828,Muskieman,2010-09-25 19:03:00,2472,"I stepped on the front panel door of my favorite tacklebox.. Plano 777 ..and snapped the hinges .. since it's  pouring rain and I'm watching fishing shows.. I figured that it was Rednuck Repair time.  I used a pencil has a hinge , with the help of my Dremel I carved it out to fit, and some blasting wire with a couple of zip-ties to attach it all together.  Works well and saved me 60$ on a new box.     Randy "

507152,wallyboss,2010-09-27 01:37:00,1095,"looks like it will be sturdy, but just for the heck of it send Plano an e-mail and tell them what happened. If they do the same for you as they did for me they might replace the front panel. .  Make sure to mention that you really liked that tackle box."
