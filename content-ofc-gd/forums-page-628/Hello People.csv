506678,Mike the Pike,2010-09-25 02:34:00,3421,Have not been around for a while.Had some health issues to take care of.  Completely made a lifestyle change for the better lots of exercise and eating much more healthier. Dropped 30lbs and feel much better.Had the high blood pressure high cholesterol. 10 yrs of sales on the road caught up with me so I finally listened to the doctor and what a difference it has made. Still been doing alot of fishing have some nice reports to post but I need help from someone again on how to post pics from photobucket.anyhoo I should be a little more present now good to be back.
