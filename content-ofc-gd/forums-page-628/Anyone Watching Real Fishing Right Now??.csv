506753,lhousesoccer,2010-09-25 14:07:00,442,"While I love Bob's show, I lose interest quickly in episodes showing fishing that I know I'll never be able to afford to do myself.  It's not just Real Fishing either.  It's all fishing shows out there.  Mostly, if I'm watching fishing on TV, it's because I want to see and learn about things I can do myself.  There are probably many people in the fishing TV show audience that CAN afford trips to Costa Rica for marlin, or Knee Lake Lodge for giant pike.  Sadly, I'm not one of them."

506760,fishing n autograph,2010-09-25 14:26:00,2540, i didn't know that...i figured it's free advertising for your area...
506761,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-09-25 14:27:00,0, Maybe for the shop owners but not for the fishermen. You'll come and steal THEIR fish.lol

506797,fishinguypat,2010-09-25 16:31:00,547,technically it's not THEIR fish
506870,lookinforwalleye,2010-09-25 21:40:00,4399,"Great way to write-off your Costa Rican vacation,lets do a show!!!  I`m jealous I have to pay for my vacations!!!"
507232,johnnyb,2010-09-27 13:52:00,3413,"Yup...as soon as I see a BC salmon lodge or a Carribbean destination, I change the channel....after a while, all the episodes look the same.  Shrug.  Of course....I should be out fishing....not wishing..."
