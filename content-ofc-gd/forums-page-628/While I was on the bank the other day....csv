They headed out to the end of the marina outfitted with what looked to be a snoopy pole and tackle box. After fishing for a half hour or so they came walking back to my location. The boy was so happy because he had caught the first fish of his life. The grandfather said ""It was this big,"" holding his arms stretched out wide. The little boy replied ""no."" The grandfather then said ""He still has some things to learn."""

506985,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-09-26 14:02:00,0,lol. Yup. There isn't a fisherman on this forum that hasn't exaggerated the size of his fish in his youth! That's why I am easy on the newbies!
