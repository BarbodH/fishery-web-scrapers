505723,FishingTheGTA,2010-09-22 14:26:00,28,"I've been looking for a good used Quantum Energy PTi, Daiwa or Shimano spinning reel and not having a lot of luck. Tried Craigslist and Kijiji here in Toronto. Any other suggestions where to look? I was hoping for a local Toronto deal if possible. Maybe someone here is considering selling? Thanks!"
505730,adempsey,2010-09-22 15:00:00,1498,"eBay?  I bought two used reels from the US using eBay (and a lot of other stuff too).  Never really had a problem, but it's certainly not risk free.  Best of luck."

505741,Fisherpete,2010-09-22 16:02:00,1814,Give Steve at JB's fishing depot a call @ 416-614-7222... I think he has some NEW Quantum Energy PTI's (size 3 I think) on sale for $100!!!
505751,FishingTheGTA,2010-09-22 16:47:00,28,  Boy that would have been great but just called and they're not on sale.
505999,hirk,2010-09-23 13:22:00,571,How about a Shimano CI4 1000?
506001,FishingTheGTA,2010-09-23 13:26:00,28, Would depend on price but I think a 2500 or so is more in line with what I need. Please feel free to email or PM me.
506008,Lunker777,2010-09-23 13:41:00,866,"I have a couple Shimano Sahara 3000's I need to upgrade... they are almost 2 seasons old.... I got them in the winter of 2009. Great reels.... just looking for something a little bit ""better"" for tournaments."
506011,ra95,2010-09-23 13:49:00,49,Someone is selling Steeze... It should be good enough.
506128,thatleetboy,2010-09-23 19:21:00,143," If FishingTheGTA isn't interested, I would like to get a price on getting one of these...  Cheers"
506132,FishingTheGTA,2010-09-23 19:28:00,28, Yeah I'm hoping for a Toronto deal if possible. I am in the Beaches as well.
506308,FishingTheGTA,2010-09-24 10:26:00,28,Still looking and would like to buy today. PM me!
506718,FishingTheGTA,2010-09-25 09:40:00,28,Guys can you hook me up?
506721,Roy,2010-09-25 10:39:00,13728,"Go to one of the many tackle shops in the GTA...fondle them all to find which one you like best, then pay the man $10 more than you you would have paid for a used reel shipped to your door. You'll have the advantage of seeing all of the brands and models, you'll have the manufacturer's warranty and you'll have it today.  Or, Take up Hirk's generous offer.  Good luck on the water."
506728,FishingTheGTA,2010-09-25 11:51:00,28, Pretty sure there's a good chance I can find one here from someone looking to sell an older reel.
