505988,jbailey,2010-09-23 12:59:00,866," because Toronto is much like New York as a city, believing the country revolves around them"
505991,jbailey,2010-09-23 13:03:00,866,"on another note, why do half of you get so worked up especially on a fishing forum write your complaints to the toronto sun or something  or alteast wait till november when we can really see what the teams are like.."
505993,stubbex1,2010-09-23 13:09:00,164,feed bag time guys!!!!!
506407,Chance,2010-09-24 16:23:00,420,"How many Leaf players are paid more than $500,000 per goal? I will save .......you know the rest."
506454,siwash,2010-09-24 18:37:00,683,"Hey Habby fans, the MUNTREAlers were NASTy on Wednesday!  Listen dude, Mtl fans are the worst when it coms to TURNING on their team - by far the WORST   It is the shittiest place to play when your losing. Why do you think so many players don't want to play for them?"
506455,siwash,2010-09-24 18:38:00,683,"  It does, And when you get as big as us then so will you!!"
506456,siwash,2010-09-24 18:40:00,683,  At least ethnicity doesn't factor into the equation! Mtl is all about French v the rest..  THANK GOD we don't have to deal with that crap here...
506503,lookinforwalleye,2010-09-24 20:28:00,4399,"  Careful you don`t step in it, you obviously do not know anything about the Montreal Canadiens franchise!"
506517,mercman,2010-09-24 21:03:00,7054,  french versus the rest of what??? and be careful how you answer this cause we may see a whole differnt side of you that may have nothing to do with hockey....
506743,siwash,2010-09-25 13:02:00,683,"  Les Anglos, les autres vs la pure laine. ..  I know more about that franchise that you probably realize. I also lived there. The media was obsessed one year after a very early playoff exit about the lack of Quebecois onthe team. That was the reason they lost!?!?!!?!?! Bahahaha  Very weird.    Just read Mordecai Richler's ""Oh Canada, Oh Quebec"" !!!   Peace"
505777,TC1OZ,2010-09-22 19:08:00,987,I guess hockey started eh?
505778,muskymatt,2010-09-22 19:19:00,2608, For the Sens it did....leafs....well .....we aren't quite sure yet
505800,jjcanoe,2010-09-22 21:06:00,744," unfortunatly the Jays are going to go the way of the Expos (remember them?) decent to excellent teams but no attendance, they'll be gone in 10 or so years    so after a summer off and 4 days of training camp everyone's expecting strangers to have great on-ice chemestry ( is there a ""shaking my head"" smiley?)   9 players last night that are expected to be on the opening day line-up 45%, excellent math from the ottawa fan (must work for Revenue Canada) LOL  Ottawa fans should be the last ones to be laughing at the Leafs, no cups in the last 80 years.... come on someone say it........."
505803,ctranter,2010-09-22 21:18:00,543, Hahaha... you just made my day!    :thumbsup_anim:

505835,lookinforwalleye,2010-09-22 23:31:00,4399," Wow you Leaf fans are a sensitive lot, lighten up guys it was a joke!  And Chance you can kiss me bleu blanc et rouge"
505836,lookinforwalleye,2010-09-22 23:35:00,4399,I hope the Leafs win tonite or a couple of guys here may cut their wrists!!!
505837,Roy,2010-09-22 23:38:00,13728, I'd go with the Colorado.
505838,tb4me,2010-09-22 23:38:00,3295,"good game so far, couple o good fights! Rosehill and Komi are out for blood as it seems"

505848,Rod Caster,2010-09-23 00:09:00,5784,2-0 boston in first period. Price has a whopping 2 saves.  
505855,BUSTER,2010-09-23 00:17:00,1336,COM'ON FOOTBALL JUST GETTING ON IT'S WAY AND HOCKEY START'S????????????? BASEBALL WILL START AND HOCKEY WILL STILL BE ON???????????????????????????  SEASON IS WAAAAAY  TOOOOOOO LOOOOOOOONNNNGGGGGG...........  :wallbash:  :wallbash:
505857,Grimace,2010-09-23 00:19:00,2020,Colorado or willow blades.  No one ever talks about Indiana blades. They just do not get the respect they deserve.
505860,Rizzo,2010-09-23 00:26:00,4754," I'm not a huge follower of the game, but it sure looked to me that Ottawa had a lot more talent not dressed than the leafs. If our young ""unprovens"" can't beat their young unprovens the leafs are even worse than I though they were."
505862,ctranter,2010-09-23 00:27:00,543,"  Seeing how badly habs fans embarrassed themselves last postseason, flooding the streets after early playoff wins like they had just won the cup, I'd say we are all a little too invested in our teams.  It's funny, yet pathetically sad, how everyone in the hockey world wants the leafs to do badly, except Torontarians.  Are we really the yankees of hockey?  I think everyone is just upset TSN doesn't care about them"
505897,SBCregal,2010-09-23 01:34:00,688,anyone happen to catch the score tonight?
505908,lookinforwalleye,2010-09-23 01:51:00,4399,"  I think the leafs won,details on the parade route to be posted shortly!"
505923,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-09-23 02:24:00,0,Yup 4-1. Should have been a shut out. Our goalie(back-up) let in a weak goal.  Looking good. I think I will start watching hockey again! We will definitely make the play-offs.
505924,ctdd2006,2010-09-23 02:26:00,531,...how about we talk about Price's performance LFW?  Typical Montreal fashion boooing and then cheering when he gets yanked!?  Gonna be a long season at the Bell Centre me thinks....kick him while he's down habbers...especially when you need him most!  Smart?  Go Leafs.
505927,Guest LivingLegend,2010-09-23 02:34:00,0,
505931,mercman,2010-09-23 02:47:00,7054,"you said Seeing how badly habs fans embarrassed themselves last postseason, flooding the streets after early playoff wins like they had just won the cup,  i say To live in Montreal last season was an incrediblle experience.I cant ever remember seeing such a diverse population in such total solidarity. It wasnt just FANS, it was everyone, young, old, english, french,men,women,......everyone. Its all we talked about, and all we lived for. It was ""We have a chance so lets rally behind our team!!!!!"" I'm not even much of a fan,but i was caught up in the craze. One of my employees works a second job at the Bell Center,and he was amazed by the spirit he witnessed by Habs fans. Embarrassed, nay nay, we were proud !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
505943,ctranter,2010-09-23 03:22:00,543," I'm sure it was fun.  Enjoy it, because it's the closest you will see Lord Stanleys siler in a LOOOOOOOOONG time with the group you are are showcasing this year.  I bet Halak is looking pretty sweet right now?  Classic habs fans booing their own tender minutes into a game."
505950,bow slayer,2010-09-23 04:09:00,1074,"yea and leaf fans have never booed one of their own,where should i start Toskala,Raycroft,Hoglund,McCabe,Murphy..............man they even booed the whole team in the first pre season game of the year."
505664,lookinforwalleye,2010-09-22 03:20:00,4399,First pre-season game and the fans are booing the team off the ice!  Oh well you can finish low again this year and get a good first round pick...opps sorry Burke traded that pick!!!
505665,ADB,2010-09-22 03:23:00,444," Considering most of the regular lineup wasn't playing in the game, I'd say it's a bit early to start the Leaf bashing.  Enjoy your season without Halak..."
505666,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-09-22 03:24:00,0,a little early to be writing them off but i definitely expected a little more passion out of new guys/guys fighting for a roster spot.
505667,jjcanoe,2010-09-22 03:27:00,744,I sure hope he knows thet the pre season doesn't count....... although he is a montreal fan  jjcanoe
505669,kickingfrog,2010-09-22 03:34:00,8333,"Ah... yes it is fall, and the class of the montreal fans is in the air."
505670,ctranter,2010-09-22 03:39:00,543,Don't know what I hate worse:  - Another crappy leaf season  - More know-nothing habs fans who never played a game of hockey and think their crappy team is worse talking about.   Get more Canadian players then you might go further in the playoffs.
505672,lookinforwalleye,2010-09-22 03:52:00,4399,LOL Geez you leaf fans have no sense of humour at all and I can understand why!!!
505675,otter649,2010-09-22 04:21:00,118,"If (big if) The Leafs make the playoffs Coach Ron Wilson will be a candidate for coach of the year award since last season - Leafs were 30th place in PK & PP,  29th place in the standings & goals against as well as being in 26th ? in goals scored. Also Toronto & Florida are the only two teams not to make the playoffs since the lock out ended so The Leafs have something to shot for & this team has almost turned it's complete squad over since Burke arrived except for Kabele,Finger & Grabovski and maybe a couple others............."
505678,bucktail,2010-09-22 05:42:00,1857,It's fall Time when the leafs fall. What do you expect from a team who's name is misspelled!!!! LOL
505680,solopaddler,2010-09-22 08:53:00,8605, An enormous loss for sure.        Agreed.    The Leafs will go as far as Giggy and Gusto carry them.
505693,Fisherman,2010-09-22 11:29:00,7201,"Whizzin and moanin, I really don't understand why you even bother watching them anymore, you know what the eventual outcome is, you people are suckers for punishment and some even pay to watch them."
505701,Rod Caster,2010-09-22 11:49:00,5784,They had a GOOD pre-season last year. These games mean nothing. GO COYOTES GO. come back to Canada would you?
505705,Harrison,2010-09-22 12:41:00,2202,"Good article in the Star today.  Atleast Quinn admits there is such a thing as ""blue and white disease"".  NO matter how brutal a team, they well always sell out.  Although in the article, it SOUNDS like he is trying to repay the fans.  Here's hoping.  Sorry.. meant Burke."
505708,Governator,2010-09-22 13:21:00,879,"Jays are so much more fun to watch, too bad they only get half the attendance of the leafs in a stadium nearly 3x larger."
505709,crappieperchhunter,2010-09-22 13:24:00,2582,"Haven't watched an entire Leafs game since Palmateer played net for them. Don't see that changing anytime soon. Living in Oshawa I can go to a Generals games pretty easily...and I find the ""O""  hockey 100% more entertaining then regular season NHL games.  For the true Blue fans though I would really like to see the Ownership try to put a good product on the ice. They can afford it and the loyal fans definitely deserve it."
505710,Dave Bailey,2010-09-22 13:29:00,1641, 
505714,canadadude,2010-09-22 14:02:00,769,"WOW...I know it's just pre-season but the Leafs were embarising,how a professional hockey team can look so bad.It's just pathetic how these guys played, no spark,no effort,nothing at all. Good thing is it can't get any worse then that so called performance."
505719,MuskieWannabe,2010-09-22 14:13:00,79,Whoever thinks that Toronto had most of its regulars not playing is mad..They played almost everyoen outside of Kessel and Komisarek....Whoop-dee-do!  That line-up last night was probably 80% of their 'regulars' so they will indeed suck again this year.  Ottawa really didn't play too many players last night so what'll happen when the rest come back to play.  Maybe if Toronto over-pays for more players they will do better?
505722,ADB,2010-09-22 14:25:00,444," Players who played in the game that WON'T make the team: Mike Zigomanis Matt Lashoff Brayden Irwin Marcel Mueller Joey Crabb Ryan Hamilton Simon Gysbers Jerry D'Amigo Jay Rosehill  Plus, after letting in two goals Gustavsson was replaced by Jussi Rynnas, who won't be on the team either.  Out of the 20 players dressed, 10 will be playing for the Marlies next year...  Plus, their best player, by far, Kessel wasn't in the lineup...to me, that makes a big difference..."
505726,Chance,2010-09-22 14:29:00,420," Nope...At this time of year the ""leaves"" fall.The Toronto Maple Leafs are named after the Maple Leaf regiment from world war one.This would be a noun and ""Leafs"" would be the plural form."
505728,Chance,2010-09-22 14:45:00,420," As always if you want the latest Leaf news ask a habs fan.You spend more time watching the Leafs waiting for them to fail than actually watching the habs play.Yes Burke traded away that pick and what did he get in return..Phil Kessel.Hows Gomez workin out for ya?? If you actually think pre season is a good judge of a team you really need to spend more time watching the Leafs..err sorry I mean the habs.  As I recall the habs basically played a few more games than the Leafs and neither ended up with the cup soooo not really something to get excited about.  Just curious why post a Leafs jab in a fishing forum???Kind of like asking what is better for muddy water bass fishing,colorado or willow leaf over at the habs forum."

505744,mercman,2010-09-22 16:12:00,7054,I LOVE A GOOD BOXING MATCH !!!!!! oops...sorry this is about hokey
505772,bow slayer,2010-09-22 18:39:00,1074,"  you forgot to add Kadri to that list,the kid is not even close to playing in the NHL,it might be to early yet to say bust but I do see a little Alexander Daigle in him"
505775,ADB,2010-09-22 18:54:00,444, I agree that he'll probably start with the Marlies and come up when there's an injury.  I didn't mention it because I didn't want to start more arguing lol.
