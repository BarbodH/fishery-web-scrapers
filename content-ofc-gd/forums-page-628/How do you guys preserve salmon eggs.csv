506999,Dusky,2010-09-26 15:29:00,310,This is the first time I am trying to preserve salmon eggs for the remaining of the season and for next year. Eggs are in cluster and were exposed to air for around half hour and then I put them in a shopping bag. Since last evening they are lying in my fridge.  Wondering what is the best way to preserve them. Thanks in advance for all the help.

507057,aplumma,2010-09-26 20:16:00,6896,"Salt and sugar are regularly used as a preservative to keep the roe from spoiling. Since both absorb water, it hinders bacterial growth through dehydration. Make sure they have time to absorb the cure before the drying process. (see Brians post above).   Art"
