506100,BillsTheBassMan,2010-09-23 18:10:00,932,"I've started sensing that Winter is on its way and that the season in the rivers is coming to a close!  I've been pounding the river religiously and trying to get as much fishing in as I can before the inevitable winter-shack-nasties hit.  On many occasions I've had OFC'ers Tybrad and Timmeh join me, and we've seen continued success.  Here are some of our outings in pics! Tybrad's Night:  Well, this one was Tybrad's day.  Tim, Tyler, and myself went to a stretch of river that the three of us had rarely fished in the past.  We started with three different presentations and Tyler's proved most successful.  He was topwatering (this was a few weeks ago now, the topwater is starting to slow down big-time).  Here was one of his smaller fish - you'll notice the feedbag wasn't even on yet:    He caught 4-5 more fish that were bigger than that fellow.  Tim and I did alright, but we didn't catch anything over 14"".  Tyler also performed a miraculous unhooking on one of my fish - here he is right after the unhooking, ready to swim another day after almost getting one right in the gills:    Also, it has been a frequent observation of mine that a lot of the fish I am catching have recent Catch & Release wounds - this is a great sign.  Thanks to anyone who keeps our fisheries in good order:    Fishing Familiar Waters  This next spot is one of my honey holes and it has produced on EVERY occasion that I manage to get to it.  It's always a pleasure to reacquaint myself with the area (even if I do get sore legs whenever I go).  Tyler and I had planned to go to this spot one night after work . . . I started the drive to the spot, after having agreed to meet TB there, and I was driving through 40KM winds and Sideways-Rain.  The sky was black and grey and I figured it was a write-off.  I had agreed to meet a fishing buddy though (and you can't break that vow   ), so I made sure I was there.  Thank God, the fishing was HOT despite the awful weather.  Eventually the sun decided to miraculously come out too!  Tyler and I were fishing the same presentation except I was using a fluro-leader whereas he was fishing straight braid.  I had caught 10 fish and he was still on the skunk.  I tied a leader on for him and it only took one cast.  He caught a FAT 14"" SMB.  Sadly, the picture has been misplaced.  Here are a few of my catches from this night (sadly, I had 2 16"" bass break off while I was trying to prep them for a photograph  ) :      Also, this night marked the closest I ever managed to get to a Heron - I was within 10 feet of the bird and it was non-the-wiser.  I managed to snap a few photos:   Saturday-Afternoon-Solo-Fish:  Mildly Hungover, Tired, Mind-Blown, I decide to suck it up and go out for an afternoon of bassin' before a stag party later that night.  It ends up being another weird day at a spot that is continously weird.  I caught three suckers throughout the day, including a kind that I had never seen before.  I snagged this guy underneath a fin - he fought like crazy and I thought I had a monster bass:    He swam away just fine despite the relatively nasty snag.  Here is the species (that Timmeh has identified as a North American Hog Sucker):    Here are some of the smallies from the afternoon (I caught about a dozen in two hours, but none bigger than the first fish pictured):      I think the feedbag is on . . .  I went out by myself to the spot Tyler, Tim, and I first fished (in this post) and I was short on numbers, but hammered a bass that made the trip worth it on its own!  If there was ANY doubt about the feedbag being on or not, this fish ended any speculation.  This brute measured in at 19.5"" and he looks to have just engulfed a nerf football:    That fellow is probably the fattest, most disproportionate smallie I've seen all year!  I also got into 4 fish on my Koppers Live Target Smelt Crankbait (which had underperformed for bass in previous situations!  As always, the fish were all returned to swim another day!  Also, here's wishing Tyler a Happy Birthday today!  Hope you enjoyed, Ryan BillsTheBassMan"
506109,Mike Pike,2010-09-23 18:32:00,1332,Good shootin' as usually Crew!  Nice job on 'em and that 19-inch plus one is a PIG!  You put in the time and you deserve 'em.
506114,tb4me,2010-09-23 18:43:00,3295,"Nice report, Thanks!"
506235,Leecher,2010-09-23 23:57:00,7832,Great report and pics BillsTheBassMan Nice bronze backs Thanks for sharing Leechman
506709,BillsTheBassMan,2010-09-25 04:38:00,932," Yeah, it was even more surprising as he didn't come out of traditional ""big fish"" water.  I'm on to browns now though . . . until Thursday anyways!  Hopefully the Bass are still feeding thereafter."
506713,sauce,2010-09-25 07:59:00,219,You'll be happy to hear that it ain't over. One of my favorite spots on the grand is just starting to turn on. And its going to stay on till the season closes. Started a bit later this year than last. The key is finding deeper water. The deeper the better. Find the deepest in a section and that's where the big ones should congregate. No fish in the hole you're fishing then try another one. Its a pattern that repeats every year. Suspending jerk baits fished with long pauses. Does anyone know why a certain dam on the Grand becomes a sanctuary after sept 30? Well its not because of trout.
506722,Guest jaeteriusZero,2010-09-25 11:08:00,0,you guys need to save some of those basses for me lol
506769,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-09-25 14:54:00,0,Great report. Looks like the bass are still active in the rivers. Gotta give those gulp leeches a shot. They look awesome.
506777,Kwan,2010-09-25 15:20:00,132,"great report. great job with the black jig-  I guess when a bait has been really working you want to get a picture with it in the fish's mouth, haha.  that is a lot of bass in the river!  "
506792,BillsTheBassMan,2010-09-25 16:11:00,932," Most jig presentations are very consistent, people are just scared to fish the bottom - it can be a hassle."
506793,BillsTheBassMan,2010-09-25 16:16:00,932," Yeah, they've already started schooling up in deeper pools.  Lots of presentations are still working, but I think topwaters are starting to turn-off.  Rapalas still seem to be fishing strong.  I'll be trouting until Thursday (extremely aggressive right now) and after that it's back to the bass and steelies until end of season."
507173,Guest jaeteriusZero,2010-09-27 02:42:00,0,"I decided to go solo as always trying my luck and went out this past afternoon to shore fish at the Grand.  Let's just say I think I caught a cold from the wind chill, but in the end it was worth it!  The Grand strikes again! Thanks guys!!!"
507176,limeyangler,2010-09-27 02:56:00,5204,Hey Bill...great report!  That is the most calorifically challenged (fat) smallie i've seen!
