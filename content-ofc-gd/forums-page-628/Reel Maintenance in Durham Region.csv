507023,fishinfool,2010-09-26 17:20:00,366, Hey Matt I give mine to John @ Tightlines on Brock and he sends them in to Shimano to do the service. They usually take up to 3 weeks but the job is done A1. Good Luck.  Stan

507037,Matty,2010-09-26 18:10:00,19,"Thanks guys. Aikmens is going to get me them back in a few days, great service and very responsive. Its just a ways out of the way, so I was looking for something closer"
