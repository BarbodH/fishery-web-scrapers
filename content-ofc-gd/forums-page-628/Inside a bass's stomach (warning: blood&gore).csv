506301,Kwan,2010-09-24 04:47:00,132,"http://i833.photobucket.com/albums/zz256/pkwanf/IMG_1945.jpg?t=1285303200heres the link if you want to see it.  I also found a perch inside one of the bags.  I do this to see exactly what the fish was eating since when I pull the guts out, theres something like rock hard and solid inside and I get curious what is in there, lol.  crayfish come up more often than anything, although I've found a sunfish before.  Don't look if your stomach gets queezy when you see stuff like this...  its nowhere near as bad as that zombie carp though  steamed bass and rice, mmm..   (it ends up in my stomach, so don't feel too bad about him, he does look pretty sad, though)   "
506335,johnnyb,2010-09-24 13:03:00,3413,Nice!  That's a hungry bass allright....my most impressive stomach contents to date from a largie has been a small bird.  
506363,tb4me,2010-09-24 14:16:00,3295,We keep the odd small bass. 1lb max sixe..they are nice eating..

506412,Brettiop,2010-09-24 16:37:00,279,"Ive seen a 40"" pike with a small Duckling inside that was over a pound for sure.....that thing was hungry!"
506535,scugpg,2010-09-24 21:39:00,1373, Yup the little guys out of a clean lake taste quite nice!
506674,MillerPhoto,2010-09-25 02:19:00,147,"Once I caught a Brown Trout and when I took him home and cleaned it, there was a frog... Still alive in its stomach!"
506738,OhioFisherman,2010-09-25 12:47:00,6623,"Caught a steel head one fall and thought it was full of eggs, nope, when I cleaned it like 22 3-5 inch shiners, shad, perch in it."
506771,Kwan,2010-09-25 15:13:00,132, eww haha a whole bunch of minnows that is gross  live frog is ridiculous...reminds me of the Biblical Jonah inside the whale until the whale pukes.... froggy inside trout still kickin'
506930,BillM,2010-09-26 02:41:00,17367,"The last pike I gutted had a nice brookie inside it, lol."
507019,SRT8 smoker craft,2010-09-26 17:06:00,1107," Go to the cleaning station at long point PP on opening day you are deffinately not 1 of the ""few"" that like the taste I have seen guys cleaning $1000 fish and have no clue they could have won if they bought a ticket .they pretty much fill a small size dumpster ever year of carcasses it's nuts .But the small ones are very good eating"
507021,danbouck,2010-09-26 17:13:00,4380, Yep bass are what people eat mostly down there.
507313,k-max,2010-09-27 17:31:00,20,"i agree smallmouth bass are good eating, but not fond of largemouth.... I think the fact they spend a lot of time in warm, shallow water affects the taste somehow"
507315,asdve23rveavwa,2010-09-27 17:35:00,2690,"   Couple of hungry Erie perch ate these crayfish.  Expect to see them in bass, but, was surprised to find them in perch!"
507344,S.M.05,2010-09-27 18:34:00,145,"Love the fish gore  I caught my limit of bows within a few hours last year on first ice and I think the ice up meant buffet time to them. They hit and ate everything they came upon.    This one had bugs, a minnow and even a frog that it must have dug out of the mud assuming it was hibernating.     Fish gore"
507351,asdve23rveavwa,2010-09-27 18:44:00,2690," More of a ""combo"".  The crayfish in the first pic is actually bigger and was in a perch that measured 10""."
