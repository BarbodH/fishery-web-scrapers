I have an Arctic Armor suit so I can take off the jacket if things warm up a bit. But being a scrutineer on the B1, and having to sit in the middle seat in a bassboat going 65mph down the lake on an October morning.. curious if it's worth bringing it or not! The thought just gives me chills already!  Thanks for the input!  Oli"

507015,Twocoda,2010-09-26 16:53:00,4130,For sale...one Arctic Armour Survival suit ...sadly its barely used...previous owner is no longer requiring a means of survival  is this a look into the future ???  IMO if ya have it ...use it... the water is already cold  Cheers and may this ad never run for real...

507310,ld17,2010-09-27 17:26:00,319,if you can fish comfortably and stay warm with a life jacket on then I would not wear the survival suit.  If you have to bundle up and that would prevent you from wearing a life jacket then I would wear a survival suit.  Just use common sense.
507336,Harrison,2010-09-27 18:16:00,2202,"Yes Sir.  Wear it when running around, then strip down if need be.  It can blow up where you are fishing the B1, better safe then sorry."
507354,HTHM,2010-09-27 18:49:00,4082,I'm hoping to wear your old one tomorrow. That way I stand a good chance of getting home.
