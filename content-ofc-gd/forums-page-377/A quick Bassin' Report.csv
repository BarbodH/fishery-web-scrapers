I haven't had the just to be online much, so I'm saving much of my pics for an epic end of the year report, lol. But I thought I'd touch base with the members here with a short report.  We woke up early today with plans to shore fish in the rapids. So after a quick breakky and checking the weather/water levels, we were off. Water is dropping and is really murky, maybe 6"" visibility. Water temps dropped a good 8 degrees last night, and started around 71 at the begging of the morning, finishing around 74 early this afternoon.  THe first thing the kids usually do at this spot is explore. They found a big garter snake, a whole wack of frogs, a turtle, and some really weird looking parasitic type worm (it looked really gross, no pic though)  I started off by tossing a Berkley Jigger craw to some submerged rock cover, and that quickly landed us a few quick bites! Really, really small bass though. So I switched up and tried a few other baits, taking one or two bites on each bait. Again, no size to speak of, but withing the first hour were on the board with about 15 fish, so nobody is complaining .          Next up, the kids all take some casts. They opted for a 1/4 oz black jig with a black/silver fleck salted grub. I thought to myself, ""great choice, I love black in the muddy waters!""  Right away, they get bit!!! Small but a good fighting bronzeback!!! Again, then again, then again! They all took turns cause this spot is pretty dangerous and I have to keep all the kids in line at all times. The kids landed about 3-4 fish each, but still all around 8-14"" mark.            My turn again, and I just decided to fish that black/silver grub for the next hour. It produces on almost every cast. Finally, I remember this submerged table rock right in the rapids, that has this overhang to it. I cast the bait and let it drift to the rock, and BOOM! Oh yeah baby, that's the type of bite I'm looking for!!! Three or four jumps later of what appears to be in the neighborhood of a 4-5lb smallie, it spits the hook. DARNIT!  We monkeyed around with some other baits for the next few hours, and everything from cranks, sticks, plastics worked to produce bites. But everything was small...  We sat around after and had a quick snack, then decided to call it a day. We'll head back out tonight and see how that works out.      Oh yeah, we got one rare summer walleye too! It fell prey to a X-Rap popper right in the rapids! First time I've ever seen that!!! It was a hugemongous walleye too, at about 12"", hahahahahaha.     All in all we musta landed about 50-60 small bass. Had a few 20-25"" pike, and missed about 7-8 bites. We had alot of fun and the action was constant!!!  Anyhow, hope you enjoy . And I hope everyone is having a great summer with family, friends and fishing!!!  "
