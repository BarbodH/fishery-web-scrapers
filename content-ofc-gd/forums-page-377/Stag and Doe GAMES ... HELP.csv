721640,Lunker777,2012-08-10 20:09:00,866,"thanks again everyone... lots of good ideas.  It sucks because the hall we are having it in wont allow outside alcohol bottles to be brought it. So the ""toonie toss"" has to be done with an empty bottle... doesn't change the game, but ya know    and I want to do a wheel barrow of booze... but again, we either need to make cardboard cut outs , or find a bunch of empty bottles haha"
721927,fishinmortician,2012-08-11 22:55:00,100,We also did hammer and nail competition. Players go head to head to see who can drive a 3 1/2 inch nail into a log in the fastest. Most wins at the end if the night wins a priZe.  Good for the typical male ego!

We are getting together tonight to plan the stag and doe and I was wondering if anyone had any cool game ideas ?  Everyone has the same stuff around here... hammer the nail in a block of wood, toonie toss, raffle, etc.  Im looking for some un-ordinary games that would be cool to have  Or any ideas for a stag and doe in general.  Thanks for any tips"
721360,danc,2012-08-09 20:37:00,4677,"They do minnow races up here. 6 or 8 pvc troughs and a starting gate which holds back the minnows before the race starts. Lift the gate and whoever picks the minnow that makes it to the far end of the trough first wins. Lots of laughs, great fun and a good moneymaker."
721362,bigmac1984,2012-08-09 20:40:00,193,"I've done this one at several stag and doe's and it has generated alot of money....  Set up a jail area (rope off a corner of the room).  Anyone can send anyone to jail for a cost of $2 and while they are in there, they cannot drink or do anything. From here, set bail at $2 for someone not in jail, or $4 for the person in jail, meaning that anyone outside the jail can bail someone in jail out for $2, or the person in jail can pay for themselves to get out at a cost of $4.  Get the DJ involved because he/she will announce the name of who must report to jail. Also, make the biggest human being you can find the person who must escort the people to jail. Throw in some handcuffs and a fake cop, and you can have yourself some fun.  People have fun with this, at least in my experience. Even if 30 people end up in jail, at minimum that generates $120 of cash for the couple to be.  Goodluck"
721366,misfish,2012-08-09 20:45:00,29133," Now I got a problem with that rule.LOL  Dan,thats too funny."
721367,bigmac1984,2012-08-09 20:47:00,193,"Also, along the minnow/worm/fishing type plot line, you can buy a box of worms or some minnows, have them at the front, and sell ""insurance"". What the insurance gets you (sell for say $2) at the door is insurance from having to ""eat"" the worm/minnow if your name is drawn sometime during the night. You will find that for the $2 at the door, almost everyone will buy the insurance. Make some cards, if someone buys insurance they keep half the card, you keep half the card as proof later in the night that they have the insurance. People don't like the idea of having to eat the worm/minnow.  Of course, you wouldn't actually force someone to eat a worm/minnow (or maybe you would), but you can do one of the following options:  1. Buy a gummie worm/candy fish and make them eat that 2. The person who gets drawn (if they don't have the insurance), can opt to pay $5 or $10 to not eat the worm/minnow   Its a sick game, but I've seen it work well also."
721368,bigmac1984,2012-08-09 20:49:00,193," You can ammend the rule and say ""no new beer"" but believe me, people will bail themselves out if they feel they won't be able to drink the rest of the night. I was skeptical at first too about the not drinking thing, but it didn't have an impact - especially if you have to buy tickets at the door rather than pay the bartender the cash."

One handed Cast into the bucket (no bouncing off the floor etc) successfully gets to draw. Miss, no card. Five Bucks to enter or Buck per cast, 2 or 3 for a buck, or buck per card won, your choice of how to charge. When 5 cards won/drawn per player, they can wait for the round to end or buy in for another hand BUT no switching cards between hands (keep it a natural draw) best hand wins...50% of pot? Options - make players use their opposite hand, stand sideways, put a lid with a hole in it on the pail,  etc. etc. to increase the challenge Oh - only underhand casts - don't want to take out any lights or windows!

721387,fishnsled,2012-08-09 21:58:00,3520,"A day in the life of_________  Depending on the venue, outside is preferred for clean up, you auction of items for what the groom to be might do/have in a day. For example, ""Bob"" starts his day with a shower - you auction off a pail/bucket of ice water and the winning bidder gets to dump the ice water on the groom. Next would be breakfast and you would have coffee grounds, maybe pancake mix, maple syrup, orange juice, eggs - all as separate auction items. Be creative with their favourite foods for all the meals. Whatever activities they like to do, make that apart of it. Ie. Likes to fish, needs bait, auction off a can of sardines to be dumped on them. The people doing the dumping will be creative as to how and where they dump, rub and pour the items on the groom.  Tons of laughs and lots of money will be generated from this. Just keep a garden hose ready for the clean up or lots of tarps if doing it indoors and close to the shower. One stag we did this at raised over $1000 on this auction alone."

721445,Default User,2012-08-10 00:57:00,72,"Also - have you seen the movie ""Just Go With It""? There's a scene where Jenifer Aniston and Nicole Kidmans characters start battling each other.  Anyways, the tie-breaker was a couples game where the coupe had to move a coconut from the floor up to their lips without using their hands.  I would suggest using a balloon instead of a coconut though"

721509,DanD,2012-08-10 11:37:00,2223,"Yea the jello shooters are usually a big hit with the woman; we used those small paper cups, like what you see at Mickey D’s for ketchup. Mix whatever flavor of jello with about 1/3 the water subbed out with vodka or tequila; sell them for a buck a shooter or 2 bucks for three.  Another thing that seems to get a lot of attention is take a large plastic garbage can, like those Rubbermaid ones. Large enough that it takes the whole length of your arm to reach the bottom. Put 12 or more cans of beer in the garbage can; marking the bottom of one with a magic marker. Fill the can ½ to ¾ full with ice and then fill to the top with water. Now charge a buck or two for a chance to pull out the marked beer can and win whatever prize you attach to it; no they don’t get to drink the beer. LOL It sounds kind of goofy but there was always a line up of people waiting to stick their arm in that ice cold water. The bonus part of this game is that the clean up crew at the end of the night has some nicely chilled beer to drink.  Dan."

Once everyone is outfitted they corall everyone in the middle of the hall, start the music and the object is to stomp eveyone elses baloon and be the last one standing.
