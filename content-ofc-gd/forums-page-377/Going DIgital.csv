Got a PiranhaMax Portable 160 for 129 bucks and a Berkely 15lb digital scale for 10. Grabbed a headlamp and a couple other things I needed also.  This will be my first year with this type of gear in the boat. I'm worried about whether all my 5lb+ smallie stories will be shattered once I get a chance to weigh a few of these fish. Anyone else find their world shattered when getting these?  Any tips for a first time sonar operator? I've read the book and I'm fairly sure of how to operate it but is there anything I haven't thought of?  I am going with 3 rods. My Abu medium with 6lb Spiderwire invisibraid (1lb thickness which I think is sweet). Also have a Mitchell/Shimano ultralight with 4lb Trilene XL on it. Any tips for a first time braid user? Is it going to be too visible in clear northern water? I typically fish Berkeley Transition. Also bringing the St Croix for some fly practice.  Can't wait. I've got that stupid excited feeling and I can't help it."
