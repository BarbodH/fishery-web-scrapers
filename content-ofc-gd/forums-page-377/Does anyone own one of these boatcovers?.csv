720911,JoshS,2012-08-08 00:24:00,729,I'm looking for a fitted boat cover and am close to ordering one from www.boatcovers.com. Anybody have any experience with them and their products?
720912,danc,2012-08-08 00:26:00,4677,I have one. I bought the best material and am very happy with it.
720914,John,2012-08-08 00:31:00,2956,I have one too. I too bought the best material and it works fine. However I should have paid the money and got a custom cover with snaps. The ties downs are a bit of a pain in the
720920,danc,2012-08-08 00:40:00,4677, I bought a bunch of high quality bungee cords for securing mine to the trailer. I couldn't imagine using the straps that came with it.
720987,John,2012-08-08 12:35:00,2956, I bought high end bungees too Dan. They make it easier to use for sure.
721003,Fang,2012-08-08 13:49:00,1330,"I bought the Sunburst version for my '02 Crestliner 1750 Fishhawk and ordered it with motor and trolling motor hoods. Door to door delivery was quick and I use mine year round on my boat in the driveway. After 3 years I'm seeing a little bit of color fading but it does get a ton of direct sun. In the winter I run a full blue poly tarp over it to help shed any snow  Mine has tie down rings every 3 ft around the boat and I have 4ft sections of 1/8"" rope that loop around the trailer frame and then can snug the tarp down for a tight fit  No complaints on the one I bought. Much better performance that the one size fits most at Canadian Tire. I went through one of those in one season."

721071,bare foot wader,2012-08-08 19:10:00,1354,I'm looking at a cover from these guys right now myself...considering a custom fit with the travel tuff material...it sounds like installing snaps on the gunnels is worth the effort compared to bungees?
721621,JoshS,2012-08-10 18:21:00,729,Thanks for the input. It seems like a decent deal for a custom cover. Think I'm going to place an order today for the weathermax.
