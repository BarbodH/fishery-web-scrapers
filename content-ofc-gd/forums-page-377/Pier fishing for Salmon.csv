722085,esoxansteel,2012-08-12 16:19:00,1307,"ear plugs will be a hot commodity now, the games have begun"
722096,John Bacon,2012-08-12 17:27:00,3277,  Did you mean Canadian Wiggler? If not what is a Canadian Wobbler? I have heard of Canadian Wigglers and Toronto Wobblers.
722118,kyle7273,2012-08-12 19:49:00,65," Yes, my mistake. It is the Canadian Wiggler that I have had success with."
721651,davey buoy,2012-08-10 20:57:00,5505,"I'm sure this has been brought up before, but now the season is beginning again. Other than a roe bag at the bottom,what brings you most success. Personally I like the Lymon lures and #28 panther black spinner baits. Bigger than most people would use but any one who have tried them, killer arsenal. Float and fly fishing is a whole different ball game. I use others as well but will leave that for later! Let us know if you wish?. Lol."
721656,spinnerbaitking,2012-08-10 21:11:00,1622,Haven't done it for a while but Ping-A-T's were my favourite while floating around in a canoe at the mouth of the Kincardine River Tight Lines SBK
721661,ccmtcanada,2012-08-10 21:20:00,7971,Glow in the dark little Cleo's in green or orange for me.   Retrieve slowly and be ready because when the hit they take you for a ride!
721667,Acal57,2012-08-10 21:56:00,10,Glow cleos or reef runner ripstick retrieved real slow.
721668,misfish,2012-08-10 21:59:00,29133,  Shouldnt you be practicing with your pin?
721672,Burtess,2012-08-10 22:08:00,901,"3/4oz glow Cleos or J-13 Raps in firetiger or chartreuse, occasionally the larger size of Gibbs Croc.  Burt"
721675,ccmtcanada,2012-08-10 22:15:00,7971, I haven't pier fished for them in 3 years! Lol.  I need that lesson on how to use the damned thing first!!!
721677,JoshS,2012-08-10 22:20:00,729,"Out on the pier various spoons and cranks, it's more all about timing. Big juicy ball of skein in the lower stretches. Roe bags aren't really effective, most fish caught on them are salmon running into the line, then sliding down the line to the hook."
721678,asdve23rveavwa,2012-08-10 22:23:00,2690,"My favorite, back when I fished for them off the pier on Huron rivers was the chartreuse/pearl Fat Rap...AKA The Canary."
721796,kyle7273,2012-08-11 12:44:00,65,"You have to try the often overlooked Canadian Wobbler but I can't stress enough the effectiveness of the small (about 1.5"" long) casting spoons from Moonshine Lures.  One charge up and they glow incredibly bright for hours.  They can be hard to find but I have seen them at Bass Pro and Rainbow Sports in Waterloo.  "
721799,davey buoy,2012-08-11 12:55:00,5505," How do you charge one of those moonshine spoons?.,and how long?."
721800,davey buoy,2012-08-11 12:59:00,5505,"People swear by the green Canadian wiggler,personally I have never had any luck. On the other hand, the green cc super spot has produced many hits and misses."
721801,BillM,2012-08-11 13:03:00,17367,"Anything you can cast a mile, chinnys aren't exactly picky."
721802,kyle7273,2012-08-11 13:07:00,65,  Only a few seconds with a flashlight or I now use a flashlight app on my phone that uses the built in LED and they glow way brighter and last much longer than the popular glow cleos.  They cast out a country mile as well.
721804,bow slayer,2012-08-11 13:11:00,1074,"have not pier fished or even trolled the river mouths in years but back when we did,ping A Ts,canadian wigglers(jointed green or silver),cleos(blue/gold,green/silver hammered finish),AC shiners and quikfish(green or skunk) all worked well."
721827,jimmy v,2012-08-11 14:52:00,33,"When Owen Sound was on it was glow cleos , ping-a-tees or flutter spoons. On Lake O piers I use the glow cleos and rattle traps alot.It definitely is more of a timing thing than lure selection as the early arrivals are much more aggresive.They are already getting a few out east off some pierheads."
721830,wallacio,2012-08-11 14:59:00,475," As stated, a few seconds with a flashlight works fine but I've found that one of the best ways to get a long-lasting charge on a glow spoon is to use a camera flash.   I've used one from an old SLR or even an old point and shoot film camera.  X2 on the Moonshine spoons...Cleos are decent but the Moonshines hold a charge for much longer.  Rattle Traps and J13s are my go-to lures for daylight fishing."
721865,ccmtcanada,2012-08-11 17:18:00,7971,I picked up an old camera with a flash on it at Goodwill for a few bucks.  Worked like a charm!
722006,Canuck2fan,2012-08-12 04:16:00,1444,"In the dark glow cleo's, or rattle raps especially the colours I see other people catching them on, why try to reinvent the wheel?  Location plays a huge part too. Just after dawn at a certain river mouth you will want to have the smallest skunk pattern kwikfish you can buy, and about 300yds of line because when a king goes out to the lake you aren't going to stop it too quickly. A few miles downshore at another river mouth when the sun pokes up you best be using a perch pattern blue fox... Once the sun is up there you need to break out the wardens worry in the correct pattern.  Of course I haven't caught a salmon in just over a year so my info might outdated LOL. Damn near time to go through my stash of lures and order those I am out of."
722015,cja,2012-08-12 10:34:00,29,difinitely anything that will have some glow in the dark
722035,davey buoy,2012-08-12 12:53:00,5505," The rattle traps are very similar to the cotton cordell super spots I have ,and have produced very well over the years."
722045,mirogak,2012-08-12 13:13:00,387,"Down by the river next to my house, I have seen Newfies catch'em on pieces of sponge ... apparently they aren't very picky.  Just gotta piss'em off sometimes."
722047,davey buoy,2012-08-12 13:22:00,5505," I agree,usually I will cast up to 3 times in the same spot,and if there there they will strike mostly out of anger I believe. Although having said that I get a lot of follow ups as well. Curiosity? hmmmm."
722051,Rich,2012-08-12 13:36:00,3927,Whatever everyone else on the pier isnt using is usually what will smash them
