I know on simcoe they are deep.  Any tidbits of information will be greatly appreciated.  If I catch anything worth talking about I'll post a report when I get back.

721172,ccmtcanada,2012-08-09 02:47:00,7971,I've fished it a few times in August...those hot days of summer.  I had moderate luck with largies in 5-8 feet of water in the bays.  Texas rig a senko weightless and toss it into the weeds and on the edges and you'll find some.  The map Chris talks about is definitely a good start.  Good luck!
721190,Toddyc20,2012-08-09 09:18:00,141,Thanks for the replies. I'm heading out shortly so I'll hopefully have a pic or two later this afternoon.
721732,Toddyc20,2012-08-11 01:31:00,141,Well we caught all kinds of fish. I think I caught almost every species in the lake. Nothing too big but it was entertaining.  Thanks for all the tips.
