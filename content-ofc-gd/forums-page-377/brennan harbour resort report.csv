721888,peter23,2012-08-11 19:27:00,95,"well the week at brennan harbour flew by and it was awesome. we arrived saturday at around 1 pm and already the hosts were great they got an atv with a trailer and brought all of our luggage up the the cabin. i will make this report short becauise i can go on forever but let me just say, fishing, food, hosts and service is amazing. ive been looking for a lodge like this for years and after trying many different lodges i found the perfect one. the weather was garbage and the owner james even said they had never had weather like this before. in 7 days we fished a total of 12 hours and caught abotu 20 walleye, 20 pike, 25 bass, 1 muskie and lost NUMEROUS amounts of fish including another big muskie. we met people up there who have been going to brennan horbour for over 8 years. believe it or not we were the only cabin there from ontario everyone else travelled from the us to keep coming back here year after year. the week was considered ""slow"" according to alll of the cabins and the host but i was thiinking to myself boy im having a great time! and this is considered slow? i can imagine when its on fire. everytime boats went out on the lake, including us, fish were always caught or brought back. worms harnesses were recommended but everyone caught on them except us. our most productive baits were spinnerbaits, xraps, and jigheads with nightcrawlers. the muskie was caught on a chartreause spinnerbait. we had met up with a guy who comes every year just for the pike and muskie fishing and he also did amazing! well i will sum this up quick, fishing was amazing especially because it was a ""slow"" week and we only fished 12 hours, food is outstanding, hosts and service is incredible. i highly reccomend it to anyone, you will not be dissappointed. here are some pictures of some fish, and our boat and the area from our cabin. i took way too many pictures and dont feel like putting them all sorry  and we only took few pictures of fish because i dont think i would have any memory left on my phone lol  hopefully you will see this muskie picture on the brennan horbour resprt books they have in the main lodge.  sitting on our deck just a quarter of the surrounding area   the boat we had   fishing         the muskie, he was a decent guy, we saw one bigger hit our lure at the boat and he actually smashed and hit the boat aswell, i wish i brought my muskie tackle   realeasing him    overall a spectactular time! probably going to head up in september and maybe next august again!  cheers, Peter."

721988,Handlebarz,2012-08-12 02:30:00,3790,Very nice looks like a great time thanks for sharing
721993,adempsey,2012-08-12 02:43:00,1498,Looks like a nice place.   Was your fishing time limited mostly due to wind?  I really like the lodges on big water since you can access so many different species of fish.  Thanks for putting that report together!
722000,peter23,2012-08-12 03:37:00,95,"the wind was what messed us up bigtime, its not that big of abody ofwater bu it stirs up pretty fast. the last 2 days raned wit lots of wind"
722025,gordy28,2012-08-12 11:47:00,638,"Thanks for the report We head up there in 3 weeks Interested re the weather. I have heard that even when it's windy etc there's still spots where you can fish out of the chop (bays, the river). Was it so bad that wasn't an option or you just didn't want to bother with the combo of wind and rain Finally love to know any thoughts you have on muskie-we have a guide for 2 days but Casey pre warned us that he's a walleye/bass guy. So any thoughts you have on lures etc would be great. If you'd rather send a pm cool. Would be appreciated Cheers Gordy"
722030,solopaddler,2012-08-12 12:30:00,8605, A friend is up there right now for a week doing some musky fishing.  I'll shoot you a pm with the lowdown when he gets back next week.  Cheers
