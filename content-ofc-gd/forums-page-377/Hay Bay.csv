721737,Gord,2012-08-11 02:08:00,20,Anyone fished Hat Bay mid Sept. and know any good resorts. Thanks
721741,ctered,2012-08-11 02:16:00,40,I have not fished it in september but I have stayed at perfect view resort quite a few times and it has always been great. The launch is a little steep on land and shallow once you hit the water but they will launch it for you with a tractor if you want. They can get the trailer farther in with the tractor than you can with a vehicle.
