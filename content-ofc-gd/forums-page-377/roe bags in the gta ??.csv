721440,kyle7273,2012-08-10 00:47:00,65,Try hanging around the weigh station for the derby in the evening around dusk. There are usually lots of fresh roe available going down the drains of the fish cleaning stations.
721450,jeffw,2012-08-10 01:19:00,267,thanks i forgot about lebarons.
721454,rocheleauc,2012-08-10 01:27:00,205,SAIL has them as well.
721518,Fishing4Tails,2012-08-10 12:34:00,38,Jb's Fishing depot as well .

722128,Locnar,2012-08-12 21:20:00,645,Tightlines in Pickering sells em
722129,BillM,2012-08-12 21:24:00,17367," Roe bags at Sail and BPS?  highly doubtful, unless you are talking Berkley Powerbait or something like that."
722150,jeffw,2012-08-12 23:23:00,267,thanks for the replies i ended up getting some at sail. Lebarons gas them but basspro doesn't. Went out yesterday but the rivers Were blown. Went for specs instead. Cheers Jeff
