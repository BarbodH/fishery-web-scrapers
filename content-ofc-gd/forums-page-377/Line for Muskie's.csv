721535,Millhouse2020,2012-08-10 13:57:00,152,"I was wondering what the muskie hunters opinions were on the minimum lb test of line they use when muskie fishing.  I know fisherman these days generally use braids between 65-80lb test, maybe even 100.  Does anyone use 50lb test line?  I would think for casting especially the smaller diameter line would give you better casting distance?  50lb string is pretty tough to break as well, especially if you have a good leader on the business end."
721537,Raf,2012-08-10 14:00:00,3495,"80lb minimum is what I use, casting distance is not an issue with baits that weight 2oz+.  A weak(er) lb test line is when the $20 lure suddenly stops mid-air on a 'professional overrun' and sails off into the distance after the 50lb line snaps."
721549,Handlebarz,2012-08-10 14:20:00,3790,Yup Raf hit it I lost a couple lures with a high speed stop with 50lbs PP I now only use 100lbs on my casting gear with no fear of a repete
721553,Gregoire,2012-08-10 14:36:00,1397,"Most of my reels have 80-100#. I lost one og my favourite lures at LOTW when I hooked into a fish with 65#. The fish raked me across the rocks and broke me off. I'm not sure if stronger line would have made a difference, but I know the 65# feels significantly weaker than 80#+"
721555,Dontcryformejanhrdina,2012-08-10 14:43:00,535,I wouldn't feel comfortable using less than 80lb.
721563,Rich Clemens,2012-08-10 15:05:00,3131,I have 80# Power Pro on all my Musky Rods - been using that for years now.   Never had a problem with it.
721564,backbay,2012-08-10 15:11:00,773,"Another vote for 80 lb, happen to have PP on my reels. I don't like losing muskie lures: they're expensive........"
721570,Thrilla,2012-08-10 15:37:00,164,I use 65# As that is what the maximum my rod is rated for
721580,Djeep,2012-08-10 15:50:00,199,"I currently have 50lb on and its not a good idea at all. Heres why.  After missing a beaut fish on a figure 8, my 65lb that was previously on the 300e, did a high speed stop and I lost my favorite bulldawg. Talk about heartbreaking. I obviously had to continue fishing that day and the shop at shore only had 50lb so i spooled it up. My buddy ended up boating a real nice one and i got a couple snots after we went back out so it was worth it.  I'm going back to 80lb asap!"
721589,mistaredone,2012-08-10 16:33:00,913,"My first spool on a musky reel was 50lb power pro, end up loosing $75 in lures that day. Re spooled with 80lb power pro and never lost anything since."
721591,Jigger,2012-08-10 16:37:00,1237,Yup. 80# is the way to go.
721595,kickingfrog,2012-08-10 16:55:00,8333,"Sure you could use it (Smaller baits and a soft, long rod) but I don't think with the size and weight of baits (and cost) used it would be really worth it."
721598,Millhouse2020,2012-08-10 17:18:00,152,Thanks for the input guys.  I guess I will have to get me some 80lb braid to go on the new Calcutta.
721712,Rizzo,2012-08-11 00:08:00,4754,"ditto. started with 80, thought I'd try one rod at 65...lost a lure on a backlash...back to the 80"
721714,mercman,2012-08-11 00:25:00,7054,"80lb on my casting combo, 100 lb on my trolling combo.  "
721715,backbay,2012-08-11 00:30:00,773," Paul, that's interesting. I think the bigger stress occurs on casting the heavier lures. What's your thinking on the heavier test for trolling? Thanks, Chris"
721722,mercman,2012-08-11 00:52:00,7054,"I think its more of a confidence thing with me.My only experience trolling Musky is on the St Lawerence.Fast current, lots of weed mats floating in the current,snags and zebra muscles.If i lose a lure casting, i will switch  "
721746,backbay,2012-08-11 02:53:00,773,"Thanks, All the Best! I have to troll myself, it just seems more efficient, but don't happen to vary the pound test. I don't have to deal with any current to speak of, though."
721747,Gregoire,2012-08-11 02:54:00,1397,If you are banging cranks off the bottom of the lake a heavier line makes sense.
721817,F_ast,2012-08-11 14:21:00,154,"Another supporter of 80# or better.  I see a lot of you guys run powerpro.  I however have a serious dislike for it.  A little tougher to find, but I use P-Line Spectrex.  Almost zero fade, zero fray, and zero line bleed.  Plus it seems much quieter running through the guides."
721821,Lunker Larry,2012-08-11 14:47:00,122,80lb minimum. Think when you're trolling at 5mph and a muskie hits the bait at about 30. You need the shock strength. Same as if you snag up at those speeds. Power Pro is excellent but don't overlook Tuff Line. A lot cheaper and I have never had any issues with it at all.
721838,cowanjo,2012-08-11 15:17:00,249,I am a real fan of 80 but Suffix 832 - switched a year ago and would never go back - I know PP has a good following as well but find it noisy in the guides
721854,Gregoire,2012-08-11 16:35:00,1397,John I thought you liked the power pro super slick
