721915,kickingfrog,2012-08-11 22:00:00,8333,I all seriousness I've only had problems with them not coming apart.  Maybe clean up the inside with a q-tip?
721916,solopaddler,2012-08-11 22:00:00,8605,Rub some candle wax on the male end of the ferrule.
721918,aplumma,2012-08-11 22:06:00,6896,Check the female side while it is together for a split if it is not split apply wax to both sides. If it comes apart easily take a small strip of sandpaper and cut a thin strip and put it into the female side with a tag to hang on to and push the male part into it. Tear off the tag and it will stay put and still can be disassembled for storage.   Art
721953,cheaptackle,2012-08-12 00:32:00,849,"If all else fails raid your missuss's nail polish, put a light clear coat on the male end (shaddap ya sewer brains!).  Let it dry completely.  Test fit to see if the fit tightens any, repeat if necessary.  If this does work expect to repeat the entire process on occasion based on how often the rod is taken apart. If you put on so much you can't get them together - back to the original source for nail polish remover!  Or return the rod for a new one...?  Michael"
721957,Leecher,2012-08-12 00:38:00,7832,It happens to me from time to time... this when I whip / force the rod on a cast... just don't over do it and it all should be fine
721963,Pikeslayer,2012-08-12 00:51:00,1443, Oxymoron?  JK
721968,Andy,2012-08-12 01:06:00,330,Rub the wax used for preserves on the one end.
721995,captpierre,2012-08-12 03:06:00,2521,Thanks Gents.  I'll try some wax first
722003,DRIFTER_016,2012-08-12 03:51:00,10439,Or you could use a product specially designed to fix this problem you are experiencing.   http://u-40.com/ferrulelube.html

722055,Whitespinnerbait,2012-08-12 13:40:00,2038,Lift lid on Garbage can...let rod fall in .........lower lid !!
722061,Rich,2012-08-12 13:58:00,3927,A couple wraps of electrical tape on the male end always sufficiently solved the problem for me.
722087,esoxansteel,2012-08-12 16:24:00,1307,"   Now that was funny, thanx for the chuckle WSB"
722088,Roy,2012-08-12 16:31:00,13728,Listen to Spiel on this one. He won't lead you astray...unless of course you're looking for an excuse to dump that rod.
722106,GBW,2012-08-12 18:50:00,8460,finishing nail if you want to keep it solid and not as a 2pc unit.
722114,adempsey,2012-08-12 19:34:00,1498,Any chance you mixed up your rods?
