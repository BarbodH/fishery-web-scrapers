721833,solopaddler,2012-08-11 15:09:00,8605,Yes I have. Don't mean to burst your bubble but it's a shadow of what it used to be.  There's a large native community on the lake that does a lot of netting.  The first narrows is as good a place as any to try for walleye. Lindy rigs with a live minnow or leech would be the way to go.  The smallmouth population is largely unaffected if that's your thing.
