Anyways here in Northwestern BC, the Sockeye have entered the streams. I remember back when I was younger seeing some underwater photos of spawning salmon out east and since then I've always wanted some shots of my own. Now this whole thing is still a work in progress as there's still not too many fish in the streams, but here's a couple keepers so far. I hope you like them and keep an eye out for some more in the near future!  And for those wondering, these were all shot with a GoPro Hero.
