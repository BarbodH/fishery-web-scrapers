721969,hammercarp,2012-08-12 01:06:00,964,There was a pretty good turnout despite two bouts of rain.  These two pictures show a good part of but not all crowd.    Here's what it's all about. A father helping his son land a big one.   His sister gets the net ready   Heads turn in anticipation of landing the fish.   The young angler waiting for the official measuring.   Fish on the board and one happy kid.   Two of the many volunteers that make it happen.
