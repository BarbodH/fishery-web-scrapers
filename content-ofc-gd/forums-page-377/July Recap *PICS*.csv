Mid-July, I cracked the hull of my boat in some rough water out on Simcoe. I cant remember the last time I was boatless, at the mercy of the dealership.  Well, long story short, they didnt come through for me but a good friend, Bill Vardy did.  He took the boat off my hands and had it fixed up in 2 days.  A far better outcome than the 2 weeks it sat at the dealership just waiting for an answer. Anyways, I did get some fishing done in July, but not nearly as much as I would have liked. Fish this summer seem to be deeper than usual but the heat has got to be a big contributing factor.  X-Zone Slammers as well as flipping jigs have accounted for most of my fish this summer. Enjoy the pics and as usual, any questions, feel free to ask away.   Fun day on Couchiching with the wife!  Some nice ones from my new home lake       Teaching Lunkerboy some new tricks...   http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W5D0YyJ3sg"
