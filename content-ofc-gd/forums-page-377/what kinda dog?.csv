722164,Steve_R,2012-08-13 00:19:00,81,Hi. Im wondering what breed of dog is in her..i know lab but im not sure what else is in her.? she has a strip of fur that goes the other direction down her back im thinking maybe German Sheppard but not sure.....we looked at pics of Rhodesian Ridgebacks and they look similar too. It goes right down her back from neck to tail about 4 inches wide the hair grows the opposite direction to the rest of her body. She's all black with brindle on her face and chest legs and paws. Any ideas?  
722167,Broker,2012-08-13 00:43:00,482,All i can think of is a lab/shepperd because of that long nose. Shes cute though!
722170,motv8tr,2012-08-13 00:56:00,2587,"From your description definitely Rhodesian Ridgeback with maybe a sheppard, and a lab in there as well or a type of hound perhaps...if you really want to know, and have the money your vet can do a DNA test to find out...  Maureen"
722192,Richard S.,2012-08-13 02:29:00,75,"Judging by the discription you gave and the pictures although not very detailed, I would say that the it is most likely rhodesian ridgeback x plotthound. Ridgeback because of the ridge of hair and plotthound because of the brindle but without doing a DNA test you can't be 100% positive.  Rich."
722193,captpierre,2012-08-13 02:37:00,2521,perhaps Doberman in there
722221,davey buoy,2012-08-13 08:40:00,5505, I'm sure as well there is a tad of Doby in there .

722268,Old Man,2012-08-13 15:55:00,822,"From looking at the hips, I'd say it maybe lab/greyhound but there's no way of knowing for sure just from the looks. Lab/doberman would be my second guess."
722269,NAW,2012-08-13 16:02:00,4022,"By the description, I would agree with a ridgeback.  However, from the pictures, I really don't see the ridge.  I've had lots of contact with ridgebacks, and the ridge is very distinct."
722272,Roy,2012-08-13 16:12:00,13728,Dachshund.
722274,cynmar,2012-08-13 16:16:00,169,Given the way the body frame looks in the picture and the brindle colouring I'd say a greyhound mix for sure.
722280,dannyboy,2012-08-13 16:42:00,367,I'd say Heinz but Occam's razor says its a Shepherd crossed with Lab.  Dan
722378,Billy Bob,2012-08-13 22:59:00,5865,It could be a Setter.............like a Curb Setter......
