722125,Fisherman,2012-08-12 20:37:00,7201," Just shrink the size of the holes in the nets and then there won't be anything left.  Nets are for hockey, soccer, etc.  It would be cheaper to just throw more bad money out there with no nets allowed.  At least then there would be no more nets full of rotting fish at all."
722135,Billy Bob,2012-08-12 22:35:00,5865,SIMPLE SOLUTION.......just have a Lake Nipissing fishing stamp for lets say $5 per year and all the proceeds go to the natives....they get their money and the fishermen get there fish.

The ice fishing for walleye was much better then it has been recently but as Rod Caster points out the perch fishing is getting better.  There are still plenty of walleye to be caught and 35 fish days are still possible. I read a report on another site where 2 people caught 132 walleye in one week."

720045,solopaddler,2012-08-03 21:03:00,8605,"  Of course the mayor is saddened by the OFAH's statement. Valuable tourism dollars will potentally be lost.  Anyone who believes gill netting isn't the major cause of the decline in the fishery either has a direct stake in the commercial fishery or is simply deluded.  If the mayor wasn't so typically Canadian, afraid to ruffle feathers and stir the pot, he'd do something to stop the netting. Then maybe there'd be tangible results resurrecting the fishery and boosting the local econonmy.  Isn't Mike Harris from North Bay? Let him run for mayor and maybe something will change.  Why do I always get sucked into these discussions? LOL!"
720047,bushart,2012-08-03 21:20:00,2628,Funny all the good ole folks want the netting stopped  Not many saying sports fishing should be altered or stopped (Short of the leaf fan)  Guess the nets are a big easy target to the solution  Better not fish...Lac Seul---Eagle Lake---Wabigoon/ Dinorwic---cuz the Nets are on those as well (and many others including the quinte area)  Maybe Nippissing needs more thought than knee jerk reactionary finger pointing---maybe it has special needs  Cuz netting is happening in these othe walleye factories
720049,Salmonidstalker,2012-08-03 21:29:00,265,"The gill netters blame the rec fishermen and vice versa. Just as the lake guys blame the river guys for low rainbow trout numbers.  In either case no one group is right, but they should work together to ensure the fishery stays healthy for future generations. Lakes and rivers are unique to their own characteristics and pressure and should be treated as such.  Finger pointing is for babies."
720081,Snidley,2012-08-03 23:38:00,620,Steve makes a great point. Why don't they break out the shotguns and salvage 100kg of walleye and walleye forage. If they get good at it I  know some other spots they can address as well.

720192,kickingfrog,2012-08-04 20:31:00,8333,"Third article about Nipissing walleye:  http://www.nugget.ca/2012/08/03/soapboxing-fishy-business-this-week   SOAPBOXING: Fishy business this week  By DAVE DALE, The Nugget Friday, August 3, 2012 7:41:39 EDT PM   It's almost funny how people play with words to further their own point of view.  We're all guilty of it at one point in time, although it can lead to problems when there's exaggeration for political purposes.  The Ontario Federation of Anglers and Hunters played a little loose with terminology this week when it declared Lake Nipissing's walleye fishery “in crisis” and “virtual collapse.”  Spread that around the province like it's a fact and half the problem will disappear. Nobody will book ice hut bungalows for weeks at a time next winter and maybe the summer tourists will head elsewhere, too.  Take away half the anglers and the people making a living off them and the problem virtually disappears.  The good people who run tourist outfits can get jobs packing up files and furniture when they close the Ontario Northland head office.  OFAH said it chose its words carefully, not actually saying the fishery has “collapsed.” But when I spoke to them Friday after they read how local mayors didn't appreciate how they jumped into the issue, an OFAH official referred to the walleye fishery as “entering a crisis level.”  Some might think I'm splitting hairs here, but there's a big difference between “crisis” and “entering a crisis level.”  OFAH timed its announcement well, too, because the Ministry of Natural Resources had planned a secret and confidential advisory committee meeting to discuss options to control recreational fishing harvest.  Many local stakeholders are participating in the discussions, including members of the North Bay Anglers and Hunters, tourist operators and other interested parties.  Most of the same people participated in the Lake Nipssing Summit organized by Nipissing First Nation this spring. Many aspects of the fishery and other issues were explored, with the idea they should work together firmly embraced.  It's not news in North Bay that the walleye fishery is stressed and everybody is tired of fighting each other.  Calling the situation a crisis when stakeholders are collaborating was irresponsible and opportunistic of OFAH.  It merely stains the lake's reputation and drives away tourists.  Truth be told, it's probably a quicker solution to overfishing than OFAH's recommendation, which was for the MNR to suspend commercial gill netting until it can manage and enforce it effectively.  The problem with that recommendation is that the province is broke, and it's cutting the MNR budget and mandate back to fit its deficit budget. The fat was cut long ago. They're down to amputating departments and consolidating districts, letting many lakes manage themselves.  Ontario can't even afford the legal bill if it lands in court with Nipissing First Nation defending its treaty right to access the resource. It barely has the staff to enforce the regulations recreational anglers are supposed to abide by. Hiring conservation officers to oversee native fishing is beyond its capacity.  OFAH is correct, the province does have the legal authority suspend a fishery, even if a native community has commercial access rights, if conservation of a species is in question.  But I'm pretty sure they'd have to close down the recreational fishing too and not many politicians or bureaucrats have the guts to take on fishermen and natives at the same time.  The days of the MNR having muscle and willpower appear gone.  There's a better chance of a positive outcome if all the stakeholders keep talking and working together. OFAH should grab a seat at the table instead of grandstanding.  Dave Dale’s column appears Thursday and Saturday. He can be contacted at [email protected]."
720195,kickingfrog,2012-08-04 20:36:00,8333,"4th:  http://www.nugget.ca/2012/08/03/ofah-didnt-consult-local-group-executive   OFAH didn't consult local group: Executive  By DAVE DALE, The Nugget Friday, August 3, 2012 7:22:31 EDT PM   North Bay Anglers and Hunters executive were not impressed with how the Ontario Federation of Anglers and Hunters waded into the Lake Nipissing walleye fishery.  “If you want to throw gas on the fire, they sure did a fine job of it,” Lee Payne, treasurer of the local group, said Friday.  OFAH issued a media release Tuesday which said the walleye fishery is in “crisis,” blaming depleted stocks on commercial gill netting which is managed by Nipissing First Nation. It urged the Ministry of Natural Resources to suspend gill netting until it can properly regulate and enforce the non-recreational harvest.  “There's no point in finger pointing. It only gets people's backs up,” Payne said, adding the situation is “not a crisis. It's a problem and as a group we think it's workable.”  Daryl McLure, president of the local group with about 65 members, shared Payne's concern.  “None of us liked not being consulted ...,” McLure said. “I personally wouldn't have called it a crisis.”  But McLure also said he agrees with the OFAH that the MNR needs to do more to manage the fishery.  “We've been pussy-footing around for a long time. The Ontario government doesn't know how to handle the situation,” he said.  About seven years ago, the MNR imposed an aboriginal communal commercial fishing licence on Nipissing First Nation with a quota of 30,000 kilograms annually, which was less than half the estimated sustainable harvest target of 66,000 kg.  Nipissing First Nation rejected that, creating its own commercial fishing bylaws with a management and enforcement system in 2005. It set its commercial harvest quota at 43,000, knowing that the recreational angling harvest was less than 23,000 kg in 2004.  OFAH said angling effort and success has decreased significantly since the season was shortened, limits reduced and slot sizes imposed to protect spawning-size walleye.  Based on a graph OFAH created with MNR data, angling harvest peaked at almost 60,000 kg in 2002 and decreased to less than 7,000 kg in 2010.  Greg Farrant, an OFAH executive, said Friday the federation will meet with local anglers and hunters clubs to discuss its actions.  Farrant said the federation has 675 clubs which aren't always consulted when it addresses conservation issues.  The MNR's review of Lake Nipissing walleye data since 1967, provided as a draft report to OFAH for its comments in May, has been shared with stakeholders but not provided to media despite requests.  Farrant said the province has the legal authority to shut down commercial fishing if conservation of a resource is required and he said the data shows the resource is “approaching a crisis level.”  Whether it's a “crisis” or “approaching a crisis” is not the most important issue, he said, “it will get toward collapse if something is not done.”  McLure said it would be fair to suspend all fishing — angling and commercial — if it really was a crisis.  “I would think you couldn't suspend one without suspending the other . . . if it's that bad,” he said. “But I'm not convinced it is.”  [email protected]"

721999,danc,2012-08-12 03:36:00,4677,"  Likewise Drew. There's probably been hundreds of Nipissing reports posted here, and not one has me thinking that I should put it on my bucket list. In fact, there's a river a few hundreds yards from my house that would blow away the Walleye fishing on Nipissing, from what I've seen. It seems to be a party place to meet up and have fun. Nothing wrong with that though. Parties are always fun."
722037,Rod Caster,2012-08-12 12:54:00,5784," I have a few ""great"" days on Nip, but other than that, I know of about 5 nearby lakes that are far better for walleye fishing. Nipissing is a great ice fishing lake in my opinion, but that is because I catch all the perch I could ever want....the walleye fishing is not as consistent.  I must have missed out on the hay-days at nipissing because I can't remember the fishing ever being fantastic... maybe that's why I don't see a huge problem in the fishery and the commercial netting. I do have a problem with the poachers and the greedy people who take too many fish, even though it is within their rights...but that applies to every lake."
722052,Bernie,2012-08-12 13:36:00,3190,"Years ago there were no depth sounders or GPS. The fishing lodges were full, boats were everywhere. Yet the fishing remained good. You could pull up to your favorite fishing hole, catch your 6 pickerel, no slot limit. Yet the fishing remained good. When the nets were no longer producing good numbers in the French River, they then came to the opposite end of the lake and started netting on the Gull Island reefs. That was the end of the good fishing in the South Bay.  Yes, some guys do well on occasion. But keep in mind that they are using modern equipment and homing in on the last refuges. To say Nipissing fishery is still OK is a fallacy.  In the summer there are only a few boats out fishing, certainly not the near the amount there once was, at least at my end of the lake. There are many fish shacks on the lake compared to what there once was. But most remain unoccupied unless the lake surface and weather co-operates. Even then, many are just there to party. Through the week on the ice it's pretty quiet with the weekends being more active. But keep in mind that ice fishing has been going on for a long time as well. My earliest memories of doing it go back to the 1960's. There were many shacks then too and those that had them were more serious fishermen. Also taking 6 home.  Yes, sport fishers do take fish from the lake, but Nipissing is not large enough to sustain commercial fishing. I agree that the first Nations should be able to take enough to sustain thier own nutrition, but to take and sell it is not a viable option."
722057,Rich,2012-08-12 13:42:00,3927,"I personally have seen nothing but bad, in any freshwater lake being commercially fished for anything but panfish. Maybe they could focus on perch to supplement their quotas, instead of walleye, if only just for a few years. Perch fillets average $2/lb more at the grocery store i work at, and a far more plentiful. Leave the walleye for the great lakes netters!"
719779,Rod Caster,2012-08-02 23:04:00,5784,"We certainly want your money!  I'm on the fence with this issue. I believe nip can handle a small commercial fishery, but the overharvesting of fish from native, non-commercial sources seems very unsustainable. Same goes for non-native poachers! I've heard lots of stories of people getting bags and bags of free walleye from their native friends. The fact that my parents can get a couple pounds of cheeks for free from a person who knows a person is very disturbing."
719783,mike rousseau,2012-08-02 23:12:00,4661,"I'd bet it's pretty equal between NFN and anglers/guides...  I'm guessing guides on nip keep over 1000 walleye during open water season.... Plus walleye anglers that get out at least once a week keeping a few hundred a year.... Plus all the ice hut operations.... I have no clue what they would likely keep in a year... So if you do the math id imagine that the number of fish taken by guides... Tourists... Local anglers... Ice anglers... Would be pretty high... Maybe not 660,000 pounds of fish like the NFN but it woul be substantial...   I think  the key is getting educated anglers to try and break the old school mentality of others of keeping everything you catch... A 3lb walleye feeds me and my wife... So any time I keep a limit of 4... We take a fish... Mom gets a fish... Dad gets a fish... Grandparents get a fish... Or I keep 1 or 2 and feed my family and that's it... Otherwise it goes in the freezer... And I prefer fresh fish...  Like others have said... Pointing fingers doesn't help anything...  Everyone should have their limits trimmed a bit... Because all sides of the fishery are to blame somewhat...  The world has changed and is still changing fast.... And it's up to all of us to take responsibility to ensure these resources are here for our kids... I know I've changed... When I was younger I kept as many fish as I legally could and would give it to friends and family... Now that I know better... I keep what I need for supper here and there... And same goes for my fishing partner for the day....  We also don't have any slot here(in Ontario waters anyways)... But I have boat rules regarding size of fish kept...  I don't know of I'm right or wrong... Just how I see things..."
719788,Billy Bob,2012-08-02 23:21:00,5865,We went through this on a MUCH larger lake.....Lake Erie....walleye populations crashed.......so GILL NETS were outlawed all along the USA side of Lake Erie.......since then the walleye populations rebounded and now it's the BEST walleye fishery in the world.....

Same fingers getting pointed at all the same parties.  In today's politically correct climate, it seems that our politicians keep  the hands-off approaches by journalists,  and the conservation community. And there's the modern separate-and-unequal race politics - central to the new tribal ""sovereignty"" - that celebrates differences instead of commonalities."
719816,Fisherman,2012-08-03 01:22:00,7201,"My grudge has always been that thing get turned in the commercial netters favour.

I was talking to many of my peers today about this subject and all seem to be having a pretty good year catching walleyes here on Nipissing..  that is not to say we do not need to protect our walleye fishery or that it is not in some stress.. But it is not necessarily all doom and gloom.  Reading carefully there are some very well thought out replies here...  However, instead of pointing out all the problems I would like to point out solutions...   In my opinion one very practical solution would be to greatly increase our re-stocking efforts.  I use the word re-stocking as Lake Nipissing's yellow walleye are NOT natural to Nipissing but were introduced in the 1920s and 1930s through MNR stocking efforts.  I do not like gill nets... and have read articles were box-trap nets are a reliable and economic alterative.. with NO bi-catch.  However, the commercial fishing industry could not exist without consumer (mostly local?) demand.   Look up stocking efforts in New York State... http://www.dec.ny.gov/outdoor/21666.html   There are many good arguments for stocking... If we take more fish out of the lake than can reproduce naturally then we either need to stop taking fish or we need to replace them.  Stocking makes a lot of since as the sports fishing industry contributes greatly to the local economy.   the cap't  "
719844,eman,2012-08-03 03:07:00,101,"I would say both regs need to be reexamined. Gill nets over harvesting and killing of other species, and there's also many fisherman out there who never practice cch and release and keep whtever the regs  allow."
719873,Sharkbait22,2012-08-03 12:01:00,297,"  Stocking fish is not the answer. Lake Nipissing was doing fine in the past and likely still has the ability to come back IF harvest is restricted. There are so many bad things about stocking. It only takes a little research on the net to learn about how it has screwed-up so many fisheries. If you want a great book to read which has a lot of references check out ""An Entirely Synthetic Fish: How Rainbow Trout Beguiled America and Overran the World""  Although it is mainly about rainbows much of the info applies beyond just them.  http://www.amazon.com/An-Entirely-Synthetic-Fish-Beguiled/dp/0300140878"
719883,Billy Bob,2012-08-03 12:43:00,5865,I have to agree.......stocking is NOT the answer......Lake Erie was not stocked......just outlawed the killer gill nets and the walleye population took off....  BTW you would be stocking fish for commercial boats to net them....doesn't make a bit of sense to me.....  BUY OUT THE COMMERCIAL BOATS and then outlaw gill nets....this is how it was done in NYS....we had a 3 year Lake Erie Stamp to fish Lake Erie at the cost of $3 per stamp per year....but after 2 years they had enough to cover all costs and it was dropped and Lake Erie has been GREAT since.
719904,cynmar,2012-08-03 13:33:00,169,"Each side of this issue has their own valid points, but the one that sticks out is ""the lake doesn't care who has the right, the fish don't care either"". This is all to true. I was at Nipissing this summer and enjoyed the fishing. I don't target walleye (pickeral I'm Canadian hey!) and like bass. Still, when I';m out fishing I'll keep maybe two fish for a meal and the rest get released. If I catch a larger fish, it's a picture if I can get it done and not harm the fish. It doesn't matter if it's perch, pickeral, bass , pike or what, the joy is in the hunt , yes I agree with keeping some to eat, but not to excess. I saw a fisherman keep a 47"", 25lb. Muskie to have stuffed. I dont' class him as a sportsman. We need to appreciate the resource and treat it with respect. That basic attitude will go farther than any legislation. This applies to everyone, if you are a commercial fisherman, you won't be for long if the resource crashes.  Bill"
719926,doubleheader,2012-08-03 14:27:00,497,"To use a phrase that's been popular here in the US recently, ""I'm kind of an all of the above guy"", meaning, everyone needs to give some if this is going to be a top tier fishery. IMHO, there is no need for fishermen to take more than they can reasonably consume. I never give fish away. Sorry, I'll take you with me if you'd like, but I won't give you fish. I never have more than 10 fillets in the freezer, I never take fish home from Nipissing, and whenever possible I release everything over the slot (although, if I ever get an >30"" it's coming home). I dare say if others did the same the lake would be better for it. As for commercial fishing, there needs to be a common understanding, their livelihoods depend on having a healthy sustainable fishery, and if there is a better way, such as the traps Kevin mentioned, they should be investigated, piloted. Why not stocking walleye? I don't get why that's even debatable. Not stocking is like having a 500 acre field that's not being cultivated. Sure, I get that there is natural reproduction going on, but at least study the impact, determine the survival rate of stocked fish, and proceed accordingly. I mean if the mortality rate of stocked fish is acceptable, stock for goodness sake. Finally, as for outlaws, they should be dealt with firmly. Establish a Crimestoppers toll free hot line number to report them anonymously in return for reward. They are stealing from everyone. All this said, I often look at walleye fishing a little differently now than 20 years ago. For me, it's like playing a round of golf. The score doesn't tell you anything without knowing the course it was shot on and the conditions it was played under. I can fairly regularly catch more than 10 walleyes/outing, sometimes as many as 50, on my home water. I can fairly easily catch an over 30"" walleye on Lake Erie, but I'd much rather fish the Nip, regardless of the numbers. Last year was our worst by far, and we tried everything. That's fishing, deal with it. Now if we started stringing years like this back to back I'd have another decision to make. Unfortunately others don't share my view, and that fine, except the livelihoods of so many people are jeopardized. The Nip is like a national treasure to Ontario. It needs to be treated with the respect it deserves."

719964,Stef,2012-08-03 15:52:00,63,"I will add a few personnal observations from living on the West Arm for the last 13 years, a relatively short time perhaps but I have noticed changes.  This area has seen a collapse of Whitefish and now Cisco.  When I first moved here Whitefish were caught in the winter in very small mumbers, all very large ie. 7lbs+ and old.  Over the past 5-6 years I have not seen or heard of any caught.  Discussions with longer term residents indicated Whitefish of all sizes were plentiful 20+ years ago.  Ciscos used to be everywhere and easily caught in great numbers.  Even caught them incidentally in the summer.  The past 3-4 years the catch has decreased to practically none.  Older residences can relate the decline from years ago and it has accelerated.  These are cold water fish, not netted in this vicinity and other than some limited winter activity not targetted by anglers, certainly not enough to cover the rapid decline.  Coincidentally, the winter temperatures have dropped each year I have been here and precipitation ie. snow also declining to the point where it is difficult to maintain snowmobiling as a viable sport.  Water temps in the summer also seem higher although I haven't kept track of this and its anecdotal.  It seems that the west side of the lake is in a state of very rapid change.  Just some observations........."

OFAH said the walleye fishery is in “crisis” and the Ministry of Natural Resources has allowed it to happen despite data indicating walleye stocks are at their lowest point in decades.  “I was saddened by OFAH's media release,” North Bay Mayor Al McDonald said Thursday. “I believe it unfairly criticizes both the Ministry of Natural Resources and Nipissing First Nation.”  McDonald also said OFAH's decision to call the situation a crisis will hurt the area financially.  “I'm actually hearing the fishing is good this year. I honestly believe their media release will harm tourism in our area,” he said.  Nipissing First Nation started managing its native commercial with community bylaws regulating harvest quotas and methods seven years ago. It has imposed a moratorium on gill netting during the spring spawn, sanctioned members caught breaching it and funds fishery research and enforcement.  OFAH said Lake Nipissing has seen its walleye fishery virtually collapse and “the problem is not the recreational fishery. The problem is, and continues to be unregulated commercial gill netting,” said Terry Quinney, an OFAH manager.  Callander Mayor Hec Lavigne came to the defence of Nipissing First Nation, adding it's policing its fishermen more than the province is policing recreational anglers.  “I think they deserve some respect from OFAH for what they've done . . . nobody polices the other fishermen,” Lavigne said.  OFAH made its comments in a media release Tuesday based on the MNR review of walleye data between 1967 and 2011.  Estimates of walleye abundance peaked in the 1980s at about 400,000 kilograms, while estimates this past decade have declined by half.  Communities and stakeholders around Lake Nipissing dependent on the estimated $130-million in economic impact of the lake participated in a summit conference this spring.  Organized by Nipissing First Nation and hosted by Nipissing University, all types of ecological and harvest issues were discussed with presentations by officials and scientists. The MNR did not address the fishery.  A summary of the MNR review of historical data showed the human harvest target of 66,000 kg, which includes commercial and recreational efforts, is unsustainable at the current abundance estimates.  “Although there have been other ecosystem changes, such as the colonization of Lake Nipissing by double-crested cormorants and the spiny water flea, fishing has placed the walleye population in a vulnerable state,” the review states.  The MNR created an advisory committee last month to develop recommendations to address the decline of walleye.  “With the help of local anglers, stakeholders, First Nations and fisheries experts, we will develop solutions to help this socially and economically important fishery rebound,” the review states  The committee met Thursday, but participants were asked to keep discussions confidential.  “The group is very engaged,” First Nation's Dwayne Nashkawa said during the lunch break. “There are a lot of issues that have to be discussed.”  McDonald and Lavigne both said the impact of the cormorants should be taken seriously.  McDonald said the 50 nests found on islands in Lake Nipissing in the early 1990s have multiplied to more than 2,000.  And he said scientists have estimated colonies that size can eat more than 100,000 kg of fish annually, with walleye part of their diet.  “We have to look at all threats and what can be done,” said Lavigne, adding that restocking programs such as the ones in the South Shore and Nipissing First Nation should be expanded.  Lavigne said the MNR doesn't support restocking as a viable or effective option, but he said the walleye in Nipissing are the result of stocking.  The native blue walleye in Lake Nipissing were fished out more than 80 years ago and yellow walleye were introduced.  [email protected]"

That's the latest information according to a Ministry of Natural Resources review of data collected between 1967 to 2011.  A summary of the review indicates walleye numbers are half of what they were in the 1980s. It further states fishing is putting pressure on the fishery, which is in a vulnerable state.  “The abundance of walleye has declined to its lowest level and may continue to decline in the future,” the MNR states.  The Ontario Federation of Anglers and Hunters is putting the blame on First Nations gill netting and calling for the immediate suspension of such activity.  Terry Quinney of the OFAH said the situation will deteriorate if gill netting remains unregulated.  “It's a crisis now and it's only going to become worse,” he said Wednesday.  He said the OFAH wants to see regulations imposed that would govern commercial gill netting operations.  But Nipissing First Nation said its gill netters are not to blame.  “It's not the Nipissing First Nation gill netters. We're putting in so much money trying to manage the walleye fishery,” said Chief Marianna Couchie.  “Year-round fishing is putting steady pressure on the fishery. Anglers are catching and keeping too many walleye. But what has to be looked at is the sport of fishing and the impact it's having on Lake Nipissing,.”  Couchie said Nipissing First Nation gill netters are having difficulty meeting their quotas.  Specific numbers weren't immediately available from the MNR or Nipissing First Nation. The MNR imposed a commercial licence on the native fishery in 2005 following a dramatic depletion of the walleye population which was blamed on a small number of commercial fishers. The commercial licence included 30,000-kilogram limit, but Nipissing First Nation adopted its own set of fishing management regulations which saw it set its own quotas.  “We haven't bothered to look at the quota because we're not meeting it. We're not finding the fish in Lake Nipissing,” Couchie said.  Yolanta Kowalski, spokeswoman for the Ministry of Natural Resources, said an advisory committee is scheduled to meet today and Friday.  She said the committee is made up of of MNR officials, representatives from Nipissing First Nation and sport fishers.  The OFAH was invited but refuses to attend because it says the meeting is focusing only on developing management options for recreational fishing and not implementing regulations for commercial gill netting.

719522,Joeytier,2012-08-02 01:11:00,3990," Give me a break.  NFN, MNR, and the OFAH are ALL doing their fair share of finger-pointing, which is absolutely pathetic.  There are so many factors that have led to the lakes depletion (read: Nipissing still has lots of walleye) that is absolutely childish to try and point the finger at any one cause."
719581,Pickeral eater,2012-08-02 04:20:00,155,"We had a great spring this year out there.  Many smaller walleye which in my opinion indicates the slot regulations are working. But the first nations must realise that if they want this fishery to thrive they need to drop the ""we're entitled to"" approach as well. Please don't take what I post as a slam but we all need to do our part."
719584,Andy,2012-08-02 04:34:00,330,"Interesting. My friend has a camp on Nipissing and he has seen good #s of fish this year, I found the winter fishing really slow this past winter tho. I was up last week and near the middle of June and I was very surprised how few boats are out on the lake this year. I'm not saying the recreational anglers are innocent, I just don't see the few boats I saw out making a difference like a quota (how is that determined and accounted for?)of tens of thousands of kgs. Not slinging stones, just sayin'. Andy"
719620,Lip-ripper,2012-08-02 13:11:00,228,I found the figures pretty interesting. Curious to see where this goes...  http://www.ofah.org/fishing/nipissingwalleye
719630,bushart,2012-08-02 13:29:00,2628,A good reminder why I do not want to be anywhere near anything to do with OFAH  Sling mud and take two steps back from solving any issues here   Funny nobody wishes to address other points---ie; how your average angler today is better informed and armed with the latest technology  Using new very successful methods and still keeping the old keep and catch mentality  Did'nt we recently read how Scugog walleyes are hurting----  A nearby lake has several campgrounds on it----funny how stringers of over slot walleyes slip into camp  Or when you know some anglers are on a targeted pattern and will not leave it alone daily----till they're looking to unload walleyes on their neighbors  It's the old--- if I don't keep it the next guy will attitude  This article is irresponsible in my opinion
719632,Headhunter,2012-08-02 13:41:00,5703,"I am by no means any kind of an expert on anything... I know it's hard to believe, but it's true! That said, hasn't Nip stocks crashed in the past? Hasn't the lake rebounded in the past as well? So, let's have a look at what practices were in place... The first crash came not long after gill nets were used on the lake... gill nets were banned, the stocks came back up. Gill nets re-instated, stocks begin to deplete... and during both of these time frames, sport fisher types were plying the waters... You do the math! HH"
719634,jedimaster,2012-08-02 13:56:00,3472,"Just ban keeping any walleye for 5 years. That'll rebound the stocks of walleye. I do like to eat walleye for sure, but it seems the answer is so obvious. Stock it heavily once, don't allow any to be taken out. Catch and release is ok. Sure some illegal poaching will occur but that's what the MnR is for. Give it time to heal itself.  There are other lakes with walleye, heck even the grocery store. Why not try a spring trip to eat pike instead of walleye. Or crappie... Give em a rest I say.  Everyone wants to point fingers here or there, the reality is they are all right. Everyone is to blame."
719645,Headhunter,2012-08-02 14:24:00,5703,"Banning walleye fishing on Nip would affect far too many folks, on both sides of the issue. The fact that NFN feel that it is ok to remove 660,000pds of walleye every year is more likely the problem. That number does not include the species that are not desirable, but caught in the nets. Does anyone really believe that anglers can come even remotely close to catching and removing that number of fish per year. My personal opinion, NFN missed the boat on this... if they really wanted a sustainable revenue stream, they should have used their expertese to lure anglers to their state of the art fishing/casino/lodge. That's sustainable! Instead, they built a fish processing plant. HH"

See many wooden boats with 6 hp on them fishin bobbers on the typical spots lately---very few  No---hot spots are targeted by finders/info and gps--and returned to constantly---and they are hitting them daily  wonder why possession limits and slots were introduced??  too many garbage bags of walleyes found in trash bins at quinte--cause somebody got tired of cleaning them---etc.   Nipp is not in the same position it was even 30 years ago----exponential population growth in southern/central Ontario  twinned hwy now taking a fraction of the time to get there  expanding ice fishing businesses  But no---lets take ofah at their word and disregard when the Chief states their self imposed limit is less than allowed
719654,Lip-ripper,2012-08-02 15:24:00,228,"I'm not saying an increase in the Ice fishing pressure or even softwater anglers taking limits isn't a contributing factor.  Your point was technology.  Your quote: ""See many wooden boats with 6 hp on them fishin bobbers on the typical spots lately---very few""  No, I don't. But I don't see natives paddling canoes out to gill net with hand woven nets either... Nylon is technology, and so is the aluminum boats with outboards on them.  Fact is, there are many causes for the lakes population being in trouble. Gill netting is the method that takes the biggest chunk of fish from the lake so it needs to be the first looked at."

719661,paulyboy83,2012-08-02 16:00:00,54,"It's funny. I know a lot of Sport anglers that have said its been one of te best years that they can remember. The only ones complaining that they aren't catching as much are the gill netters. Would it stand to reason that if you net the same area long enough you might deplete the population of fish. If the anglers are returning to their hotspots and having success still I would seriously doubt that it more the fault of the sport fisherman than the commercial fisherman.  That being said, I believe all of us play a part and all of us should be working together to maintain the population of walleye as so many people depend on that for their livelyhood."
719668,Millhouse2020,2012-08-02 16:23:00,152,"I've said before on this forum that I have watched this fisheries decline for a number of years now.  The good old days of walleye fishing are long past on this lake right now.  If people are still catching fish, its because they have the equipment and technology to be able to do it.  I can recall many years ago that if you could not catch walleye pulling a crawler harness, jig & spinner or rapala, you may as well just go back to camp and play cards for the day because the fish had lock jaw.  I was out on opening day this year near Lavigne and saw only a handful of boats around the hardwood islands.  This place used to be teaming with fisherman every opening weekend.  I can even remember MNR boats patrolling the waters with armed officers many years ago on opening day.  I'm certain the decline in the walleye population has made it very hard for the lodges around the lake to keep people coming back.  Not to mention the exchange on the US$ has hurt their business as well.  How can you have a Canadian wilderness fishing experience with so few fish????   Gill netting has hurt the population of fish immensely in the lake in my opinion.  It has been know for some time that some in the native community net plenty and do not report their catches.  How can netting be monitered properly if people are not following the rules.  Sport fisherman don't take anywhere near what the gill netters do, heck there seem to be so fewer of them from what I can see.  Gill netters also have plenty of by-catch.  I dont even want to know how many healthy bass, pike, muskies, whitefish and whatever else gets killed along with the walleye catch.  I know of some fisherman personally that have witness these fish left on the shoreline of iron island after the gill netters had gone.  Very little is truly being done to manage this.   Add to the above the rise of cormorant population in the last 10 years and you have a lake struggling to maintain is formerly healthy balance of fish.  It has been a shame to watch for me because this lake is where I first learned to fish and hunt and I hope to see it return to what it once was.  The slot limits have helped somewhat but it has not been enough to ensure the future of the fishery IMO."
719673,bushart,2012-08-02 16:32:00,2628,I have a buddy who's one of Canada's best walleye fishers---likely has forgot more than any of us will ever know  He attributes the sustainability and increase in population to the slots and reduced limits---where even in northern communities often thought to be fish factories---has seen improvements  So by implementing these rules is like a forced education---and is showing on the numbers  And still many of these lakes have Native nets as they always have been

Is this part of an eb and flow or a problem we have created?"

How many of us would go to a lake that is only catch and release? Sure there are some very isolated lakes that are that way, but there are only a limited number of lodges on those lakes. They are typically ""trophy lakes"". A lake like Nip, with it's bordering cities, towns, camps and lodges would see their tourist dollars drop like a stone. As it is, I'm betting that the lodge owners on Nip are hurting as a result of the last number of years and the reputation the lake is now getting. How many members here now look elsewhere when they are planning a fishing trip. There is only one reason...they are not catching numbers or size anymore. HH"
719721,blarg,2012-08-02 19:48:00,289,"I have only been fishing out of North Bay for 5 years, right about the time the native fishery became sanctioned by the government.  The first year fishing was pretty good by my standards, i spent a number of years in Yellowknife before that so it wasn't what i would call phenomenal, but definitely good.  It's gotten worse every year since, there are fewer fish, and the season along the eastern shore is shorter.  Now during that time we have had low water, bad weather early in the season, and early ice off and faster warming then normal, these things could certainly have affected the early shallow water season.  That isn't the only sign though, if the gill netters aren't finding fish chances are they aren't there, all of this anecdotal evidence about your buddy who lives on the lake doesn't mean anything in the face of that.  I think the ice fishing season is certainly a problem, it gives too many people easy access to the lake, allowing them to get to those places they couldn't without a boat, not to mention having people on the best spots day and night for months.  Of course there are anglers poaching, and there are a lot of people out there all summer as well, keeping all they can.  If the limit was two fish a person that might help, but in reality people will still poach and that will just leave more fish for the gill nets, it doesn't help the lake.  You know it's disturbing to me that i read a lot of worry about the conservatives and the new laws or removal of old laws, and perhaps rightfully, but you're willing to gloss over the impact that gill nets have on this lake, gill nets are the most destructive form of fishing maybe aside from trawling, and we managed to basically fish out the oceans but somehow gill netting this lake is going to be just fine?  I don't care if it's their right, i don't care because the fish don't care, the lake's ecosystem doesn't care either.  Gill nets are never a good idea, i have personally seen a couple dozen white suckers thrown over the side from one net, all dead, multiply that by the years and the number of nets, most of us would be upset by the angler who kills unwanted pike for the sake of the walleye, but when it's death by gill net, it's a shrug at most.  I promise you that the gill nets in Nipissing are doing more damage to the fishery than any new legislation will. Shrug."
