721237,Pikeslayer,2012-08-09 13:56:00,1443,"Got out last night with I'mHooked (Craig) & HTHM (Albert). Fishing was not fast & furious, but both landed their new PBs. Both fish tipped the electronic scale @ 22 lbs. TWINS  Both revived & released to swim the river. Craig'sAlbert'sA A quick vid of Craigs landing (unfortunately it was a little dark to shoot vid for Albert)  <iframe width=""560"" height=""315"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/c6TO4oqJ4_M"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>"
721239,Broker,2012-08-09 13:59:00,482,"Looks like you guys had a great night, nice video of the fish!"
721245,asdve23rveavwa,2012-08-09 14:19:00,2690,Couple of beauties Simon...not talking about Craig and Albert  Congrats on the PB's guys!!
721246,Moosebunk,2012-08-09 14:27:00,3970,Some great evening nooks PSlayer.
721247,Billy Bob,2012-08-09 14:27:00,5865,You let them GO......  ...now what are your cats going to eat...
721263,Pikeslayer,2012-08-09 15:19:00,1443, Did indeed.   Saved those for Juli Frank (talking about the fish!!)   It was a perfect evening on Lady O MB   Ninja & Oliver eat exclusively perch & walleye Bob. Can you bring me some in September
721268,I'mHooked,2012-08-09 15:27:00,525,"Hey Simon, you beat me to it! Was going to post the report shortly. Darn fine looking cast of characters! I didn't realize you were even shooting the video, I must have been in the zone with focused determination! Thanks for the video memories!...(there was some weird freaking bug that kept landing on my cranking elbow)  Great time ""as usual"" Simon. (Been out enough together that can use that phrase ""as usual"" now   )  Great hanging with you as well Albert...(so, do you have the GPS coord's to Mike's camera on the Grand? Cuz you know there's still some great never seen pictures still on it  )"
721270,Salmonidstalker,2012-08-09 15:33:00,265,Going out tonight for some of that action. Nice job on the nooks.
721273,Live2fish85,2012-08-09 15:37:00,1633,Nice work. Those are some nice fish and still pretty silver.
721275,belippy,2012-08-09 15:41:00,88,Nice video and nice fish. Why did u keep blowing your arm?
721279,I'mHooked,2012-08-09 15:47:00,525, There was some weird freaking bug that kept landing on my cranking elbow.  Was annoying as heck.
721335,misfish,2012-08-09 18:43:00,29133,  I thought you were just cooling off.LOL  Nice fish and vid boys.
721358,CRUD150,2012-08-09 20:24:00,87,Nice fish! Amazing to think that an 18lb'er has been  leading the Chantry Classic all week over here on the ON west coast.
721396,fishnsled,2012-08-09 22:33:00,3520,A great evening on Lady O. Nicely done!!
721403,mercman,2012-08-09 23:03:00,7054,Great reprot Simon!!! Nice to see Albert with a fish in his hands  
721424,Leecher,2012-08-10 00:13:00,7832,"Simon, here I thought, I was going to see, two beautiful speckles, perfectly cook, pan seared, laying side by side in a butterfly position  Some good looking fishes boys    Congrats"
721428,mike rousseau,2012-08-10 00:23:00,4661,nice catch....  looks like a great night on the BIG O
721434,spincast,2012-08-10 00:38:00,3279,Nothing like putting someone onto a PB. Great experience
721435,alphaalpha,2012-08-10 00:43:00,475,"Great report and vid, thanks for sharing.  I picked up the same net you have this year and it seems more hooks get stuck in that than my old blue nylon mesh.  I have had to slice holes in it a couple times to get a fast release.  how do you find it?  -AA."
721466,skeeter,2012-08-10 02:18:00,1907,Another awesome report Simon. And 2 happy fishermen.  I'm glad you didn't have that video camera when you took me out. You would have had to much editing to do cause I tend to get a little more excited then them when I catch fish like that.
721472,Skipper D,2012-08-10 02:43:00,1970,"Awsome Simon , nice to see guys getting a chance to do what they like  . WTG guys ."
721511,HTHM,2012-08-10 12:03:00,4082,"Thank you for a great night, Craig your pics are probably swimming somewhere in Lake Erie right now. Sucked up by a monster catfish......"
721551,Pikeslayer,2012-08-10 14:26:00,1443," Jacques, the speck pix are on my new phone. Still figuring the damn thing out  Just as awesome as getting your own  Which I am still waiting for this year.   Alfy, yeah about the hooks, but over time you get used to 'de-hooking' the net and it becomes a little less aggravating. The upside is that it is strong & big enough to bring in a 32.5 lb salmon, so it is a bit of a trade off. Have yet to hear of the perfect LO net.   ""Screaming like a ______"" comes to mind Skeeter  Thanks to all who viewed and commented. Now I have to figure a plan for this weekend for a couple of more OFC guests (I think a Tyee is in the near future). Weather is gonna be a bit of an 'itch', but we'll 'git r dun'."
721666,cowanjo,2012-08-10 21:44:00,249,"Hey craig nice work, about time you started getting new PB.....salmon or musky your going to have to decide??"
721703,spincast,2012-08-10 23:31:00,3279,Good luck if you're tryin' this weekend. Bouncy would be a mild description form what I see? Hey Frankie - be sure to take some vids for me - oh and wear your Kevlar shirt
