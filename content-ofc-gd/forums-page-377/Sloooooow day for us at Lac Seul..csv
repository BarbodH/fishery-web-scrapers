721036,limeyangler,2012-08-08 16:47:00,5204,"Hi all,  Ok....the disclaimer.......I know fishing is better than working....i know that 30 fish is not a bad day.......and this is not in anyway a statement about not appreciating and/or taking for granted being able to fish some outright awesome locations right on my doorstep. This is just a report for 6 hours on Lac Seul....that by previous standards was SLOW....for us anyway .  Fishing was slow.....started off good, I guess we should have stayed and dissected the first spot as we hit into 3 decent fish right off the bat, and saw more on screen....although they were shy to commit (watching your jig on screen helps to determine what action will trigger a bite). First stop was the front of a midwater reef in a small bay facing into the wind in about 30FOW.   We then went to try some wind swept shores where i have hammered them before in anything from 17' to 4' FOW.....NADA....NUFFINK.....ZERO....WEIRD!!??    Still confident this was just one of those things...fish move...whatever...we headed to my other deep water/reef/ structure spots......again....hardly a bite except Jackfish in 3 seperate locations.....really weird.  I was marking fish...and they would follow the jig up maybe a few inches off bottom before hunkering back down. At 5pm they switched on in a couple of my spots....but i think the majority of the fish were further out in the main basin...i did not have enough gas to get out there.  The boys back at the landing gave mixed reports...from ""awesome fishing""...to ""you were fishing too deep"" , to ""it was slow"" Anyway....great to be out....thats the slow day out of the way....lol....tight lines.

Tight lines   Simon"
721041,Jds63,2012-08-08 17:00:00,1365,would love to be up there and experience a slow day like  that .... still awesome Simon ...
721055,Toad Hunter,2012-08-08 18:31:00,261,I'll take a slow day like that any day
721146,spincast,2012-08-09 00:05:00,3279,Yep - I'll trade one of your slow days for a week of my average days anytime - deal? Them is still some beauties
721195,Grimace,2012-08-09 10:33:00,2020,Good stuff.  When they won't commit to a jig I switch to a Lindy Rig and and slowly drag it with a minnow.  Those are some beautiful fish.  Lac Seul is on my list.
721449,Leecher,2012-08-10 01:13:00,7832,"Are you serious dude?

721647,limeyangler,2012-08-10 20:50:00,5204,"LOL....  People....people.....you dont understand...lol.   I am not complaining about a slow day....just saying it was.   Was still an awesome day out. I just go up there expecting a normal 50-100 fish session with countless 25"" - 28"" fish."
