721898,Joeytier,2012-08-11 20:28:00,3990,It's ridiculous how well white spinnerbaits work on those big largies.
721902,kickingfrog,2012-08-11 20:59:00,8333, â€¦ and the small ones too.
721906,manitoubass2,2012-08-11 21:23:00,11391,"Nice fish RC!!!!! First cast fish always make the day so much better, at least for me"
721909,Toad Hunter,2012-08-11 21:41:00,261,"I notice your location says Nord bay, but I swear 2nd and 3rd shot look like the narrows between K-mog and Soyers Lake lol nice fish regardless of location. And I apologize if i've said too much"
721917,Rod Caster,2012-08-11 22:03:00,5784, This lake is only 20 minutes outside of North Bay.
721942,Leecher,2012-08-12 00:00:00,7832,It's kind of weird to see you holding largies since it's not your usual style Got to love it when they come out to play Great job Chad   Good luck on your laker hunt Jacques
721949,spincast,2012-08-12 00:14:00,3279,"sweet fish there Chad   I really shoudl make a trip out for those -love their energy . Good luck on the laker hunt - and if the opportunity ever permits, make a trip down here  and we'll see if we can't put you on  a few Lake O spring lakers. Just send the PM  "
