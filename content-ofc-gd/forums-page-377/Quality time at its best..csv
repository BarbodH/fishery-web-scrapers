He is going through a stage where certain parts of his body are the hot topic of the moment, so last night, according to Jack, we went to 'Willy' Lake.  I tried to convince him of the lake's real name but he was not having it. I had to laugh though...he was only a chromosome or so away from getting the lake's name right( anatomically speaking) since the lake in questions actual name is 'Beaver' (snigger)   Anyhoo....while mum is on a girly road trip to TBay....the mice will play. Unlike our last trip out he had little interest in fishing, but i think that has more to do with the guide's inability to put him on some decent perch action .   I cant even imagine him growing up anywhere else.......      <iframe width=""560"" height=""315"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/iKZoovWJZ9g"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>                             "
