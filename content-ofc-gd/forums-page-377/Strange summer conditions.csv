721193,singingdog,2012-08-09 10:27:00,1047,"Several of the lakes that I fish regularly are very different this summer: much lower plant growth, much higher water clarity. Most years the plants - especially cabbage - on a couple of lakes are so thick that the fishing gets difficult. This year the cabbage is waaay more sparse. As well, the water clarity seems much higher. Yesterday I was flyfishing for LM. It was like flats fishing: sight fishing super spooky fish that I could see easily in 6 FOW. I have even started using different presentations on a couple of lakes that are usually very stained, but are very clear this year. Anybody else notice a change in plant growth/water clarity this year? Change in fish behaviour?"
721206,bushart,2012-08-09 11:40:00,2628,I noticed this last year-----no idea why??  True though---makes it tougher
721217,Broker,2012-08-09 12:14:00,482,"I've actually expierenced the opposite of you, I've seen more plant growth since the river is so shallow this year."
721229,cheaptackle,2012-08-09 13:28:00,849,"Opposite here too - weeds way up & algae bloom so bad it almost looks like I could walk across it in our small cove (waves washing it in, looks like a thick green & white pond scum).  Tons of weed washing up on shore too.  Water is very low as well, but it's only my 3rd summer here so I have to believe what I'm told is normal.  Michael"
721232,kickingfrog,2012-08-09 13:47:00,8333,The sun is the engine (or is of motor ) that powers plant growth.
721322,Live2fish85,2012-08-09 17:48:00,1633,Yea Lake Erie has a ton of weeds this year. More then usual for my area. They are alot higher as well.
721332,Toad Hunter,2012-08-09 18:33:00,261,"I know the pond in my back yard tends to get cloudier after a few rain days, maybe the water clearity might be due to less rain murkin it up ? As for plant growth, well most of mine are scortched."
721499,singingdog,2012-08-10 10:07:00,1047,"I would have thought that the hot, sunny summer would have driven lots of plant growth (thanks for the Gr 4 biology lesson kfrog), but that doesn't seem to be the case in the Highlands...at least not the lakes I have been on."
721501,bushart,2012-08-10 10:50:00,2628,The lake I referred to is gin clear---should be gettin lots of sun---always has  just some weird phenomenon-----sparse weed growth when there traditionally has been some

721778,Whitespinnerbait,2012-08-11 10:43:00,2038,Same thing in my neck of the water.......weede growth is very sparse
