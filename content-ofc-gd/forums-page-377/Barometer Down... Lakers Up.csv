722392,Out4Trout,2012-08-14 00:03:00,98,"Slipped out for some trout ahead of a rainfall, the overcast skies were perfect for the trout to be on the feed. Pulled up a few small lakers right away, then several Cisco. This particular one had been chewed on before...   After trying a different spot on the lake, a solid hit stopped the lure. After a few good runs, this fella came in to say hello...   Dropped the lure back down, and in 10 lifts had another good hit, and another chunk came up for air. Nearly a twin to the previous fish, but this one had a bit more girth. The slime was literally dripping off this fish. It had an interesting pattern in the spots, from the right ventral fin up to the dorsal fin. Good identifier if I catch it again someday.   Always a good time chasing the Lakers... and a falling barometer makes it that much better!!  O4T"
