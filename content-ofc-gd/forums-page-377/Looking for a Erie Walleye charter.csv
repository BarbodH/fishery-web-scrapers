Was thinking of doing a Erie Walleye charter. I checked the Classifieds but did not see anything. Can anyone suggest a good one that is affordable for 2?  We are in Milton so closer to East is better. Any other suggestions are welcome as well. Would be last week of August and a weekday. Maybe Simcoe would be good too. Not really into Salmon fishing so I would prefer something with the oppurtunity to catch warm water species.  I know there are a ton of guides on the web but was hoping for a personal referral or even a board member.  Thanks."

721784,ctered,2012-08-11 11:19:00,40,Try Erie Tracker out of Port Colborne. Both Erie Tracker and Fishmaster own tackle stores so you should be able to google for phone numbers.
721788,Woodsman,2012-08-11 11:53:00,1286,That could be a tough bill to fill depending on your definition of affordable. Most charter boats charge a flat rate for the boat. Expect $400 to $600 for a half day charter (5-6 hrs). Divided by 2 is far more expensive than if you have 4 to split the costs. Not all boats handle the same number of customers with the smaller boats being less money generally.
