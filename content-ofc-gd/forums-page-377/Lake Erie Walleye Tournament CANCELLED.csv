It is also with regret that due to our busy club events schedule, the event will not be rescheduled in 2012, but we look forward to planning the event to return to Port Bruce in 2013. Thanks to North Erie Marine for your help in spreading the word to those calling about the event. Be sure to return to our website for more on the event in 2013 and we look forward to your participation.  Our next upcoming event is our Crystal Beach Bass Challenge on Aug 18.  http://straitlineang...eries_index.htm   Thank You for your understanding.  Strait Line Anglers Club Committee "
