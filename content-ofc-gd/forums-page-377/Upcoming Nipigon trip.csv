I will have my boat with down riggers and all the rods, reels and tackle I'll need for all species. I'd just like to ask any of you Nipigon vets if there are some go-to lures you don't leave home without specifically for Nipigon. I am sooooooo pumped for this trip as I have driven past over 20 times and never had the time to stop. If all goes well, I will be making this an annual trip. I'll be sure to post a report on my return. Any advice or tips would be greatly appreciated. Thanks"
