721879,chefboi17,2012-08-11 18:25:00,128,"I got a pair at sail in burlington, 35$ each, a few weeks ago"
721883,Christopheraaron,2012-08-11 18:44:00,3525,Really? I keep looking there and the only ones I see are the cheaply built $60 holders that I can't even use for my canoe. What section did you find them in?
721885,Terry,2012-08-11 18:50:00,14456,basspro has them http://www.basspro.com/DownEast-Salty-S10-Rod-Holder/product/52317/96407  http://www.basspro.c...All/Ntt-holders
721886,Christopheraaron,2012-08-11 19:01:00,3525,"Thanks terry, I knew that they sold them but on their site it says that they're out of stock, but.... I just called and they have them! Thanks!"
721889,chefboi17,2012-08-11 19:32:00,128,"I didn't see them when I went to the vaughn location, but they were right at the top of the stairs at burlington, full display of the saltys and the single clamp model"
721892,Christopheraaron,2012-08-11 19:53:00,3525,Sorry I was talking about vaughn...
721895,chefboi17,2012-08-11 20:20:00,128,"Depending on how soon you need them, etackle is another great option. There was actually a threadabout these last week with a few other places that would have them if bass pro happens to sell out before you get there"
721951,Christopheraaron,2012-08-12 00:23:00,3525,"Alright I got one at bass pro, so far I love how smooth they are to use, thanks!"
