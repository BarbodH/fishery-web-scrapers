I need to have an early retirement dream...  lol  I recall working from about the age of 9, but I think that was legalized child slavery from my parents as I don't recall being paid a wage per se, but I also don't recall paying rent so maybe we were even...  Charles"
318065,rob v,2009-03-16 17:52:00,535,My son was delivering papers well before he was 14 - but I think I needed to sign a parental consent.  I sure wish there was some kinda act when I was younger than 14 - growing up on a farm meant you were doing plenty before you were 14.   My guess is if there was some type of legislation like that then it wouldn't have carried much weight with my folks.
318069,Bernie,2009-03-16 18:02:00,3190,Every kid in Canada should have to work a farm for one summer in their teens. Was a real eye opener for me at 14. Great physical training.
