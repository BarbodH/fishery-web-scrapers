317594,lew,2009-03-15 18:14:00,12766,"This has to be the best day we've had so far with sunny skies & warms temps  Been cleaning up out side in shorts & T-shirt, did some work on my truck, then figured it was sooooooo nice, I put the snow shovels in the shed along with a bag of salt I had left over and even put the snowbrush in the basement.  Gonna take the winter tires off this week and put on the summer rubber & chrome wheels.  Even heard some robins in the woods this morning.  Gotta love the 1st signs of spring !!!!"
317596,Terry,2009-03-15 18:23:00,14456,"oh, I just looked out the window          LOL"
317598,HTHM,2009-03-15 18:35:00,4082,We know who to blame for April's snow storm now.
317600,Greencoachdog,2009-03-15 18:39:00,8163,Those bananas ought to be ready to harvest soon eh Lew!?
317601,lew,2009-03-15 18:44:00,12766,"1st thing my wife said when she saw what I was doing was that we'll probably get hit with a blizzard next week, but I figure we hafta think positive   Those little yellow buds are forming on the trees as we speak Glen"
317602,Raf,2009-03-15 18:52:00,3495,"been relaxing in the yard and i think i saw an oriole today.  i'm not a bird expert, waiting for him to come back with camera in hand.  18"" of ice on simcoe yesterday though, some time before open water."
317603,jwl,2009-03-15 18:52:00,1056,"I hear ya on that one!!!  beautiful, I been outside puttering too, had to change a rim/tire on my boat trailer, now I am going to do some spring cleaning in the boat from all the steelhead slime in it, too cold to clean it up the last couple months when I get home after fishing  Then it's time to give all the screws, nuts and bolts the once over and see what needs to be tightened up ect, and she is good to go fishin again ..maybe even tommorrow"
317608,JohnF,2009-03-15 19:04:00,3494,Opened the sun roof on the car and went off to make the rounds of the local fishing spots. Water's high and dirty but spring is definitely in the air.  JF
317616,Raf,2009-03-15 19:24:00,3495,"well he came back  so is it an oriole??  if it is he must've snuck in my carry-on, i was in maryland last wk.  "
317620,JohnF,2009-03-15 19:29:00,3494, Looks like a plain ole robin to me.  JF
317622,Raf,2009-03-15 19:30:00,3495,robin it is!  think i'll call him oriole.
317623,JohnF,2009-03-15 19:31:00,3494, But it's one more than I've seen so far.  JF
317671,JohnAB,2009-03-15 21:47:00,178,"Woke up to cold temps and a light dusting of snow out here in Alberta! At this rate, ice will be gone sometime around the August long weekend."
317712,bigugli,2009-03-15 23:01:00,6138, Now you're teasing!
317728,camillj,2009-03-15 23:17:00,1988,"  Lew, we must have been reading the same Farmers Almanac ... I swapped my snow shovel for a rake on the front porch yesterday .... everyone commented on my freshly raked lawn ... and today when I got back from fishin on Simcoe ... I couldnt help myself .. I tossed both bags of Artic Traction and my auger out of  the trunk into the basement for next year along with the scraper/brush ... and tossed my golf clubs into the trunk (just in case) ... I was worried that I was gonna make it snow for sure... now I'll rest easy knowing it was all your fault"
317732,Mike the Pike,2009-03-15 23:22:00,3421,Now you did it Lew .Maybe you won't get another storm down south 500kms but I know we will get at least one more here in Montreal.  I was lookin at the snowblower today in the garage .I wanted to put her away in the garden shed but I know mother nature will most likely give us one more snow fall and NOW my friend I know I can blame it on you
317736,GBW,2009-03-15 23:25:00,8460,"Don't feel bad Lew, I took my snows off last weekend and sure enough I woke up to snow the next day..."
317740,mistyriver1,2009-03-15 23:29:00,600,"Beautiful day outside Lew !!!  I'm ready for spring, especially in 49 days"
317752,jwl,2009-03-15 23:49:00,1056, not teasing...I AM going fishing tommorrow
317756,Greencoachdog,2009-03-15 23:59:00,8163, He looks kinda pee-peed off about being called an Oriole Raf!... be nice to him or he'll peck yer frakin' eyes out!!!    Spring is only 5 days away... for the numericaly challenged.
317831,crappiesteve,2009-03-16 01:42:00,220,"Lew,wishful thinking Bud.  Stave"
317906,mistyriver1,2009-03-16 11:03:00,600, Thanks TIPS    but I wasn't referring to the change of season.
317909,lew,2009-03-16 11:24:00,12766,"I understood fully Jim, but it sure seems like a loooong ways off when you say 49 days  ......well, make that 48 now......& counting"
317921,John,2009-03-16 12:35:00,2956," Yeah, I understand that excitement Jim...same thing for me last year and I only had to wait two weeks..."
