318269,Grimace,2009-03-17 01:23:00,2020,Just ordered tickets for the Fly Fishing Film Tour at the Bloor St Cinema Saturday night.   Should be pretty wicked.   Gonna head there with the old man after the sportsman show.  www.flyfishingfilmtour.com  I am not a spammer or anything I have no vested interest in it.   Just think it should be neat and worth a look.
