317935,Tarzan's Jane,2009-03-16 13:23:00,1183,Very tragic and so sad.  The mind can take us to horrible places....but they were together and I hope that the father/husband will find some comfort in that.
318115,Laker272,2009-03-16 20:47:00,45,"What a devastating read that was. It proves that even though we, as mankind, with all our machines and ideas are still just a midget when it comes to the power of mother nature. Our thoughts and prayers are with the family and friends. Please use caution around our thawing lakes."
318176,musky66,2009-03-16 23:15:00,273,"Can't believe they were strapped into the machine while ice riding- very stupid, and very, very sad."
317530,lew,2009-03-15 12:23:00,12766,Heard on the radio just now about a mother and son who were riding an ATV on the ice in Muskoka yesterday and went through the ice and apparently both died. Said the father was on another machine and saw them go through but couldnt do anything to help.  Lotsa sad things happening on the ice this year.
317531,BUSTER,2009-03-15 12:26:00,1336, soooo sad my deapest sympathy's
317532,Greencoachdog,2009-03-15 12:27:00,8163,That is a terrible tragedy that could've been prevented.
317538,smokin joe,2009-03-15 12:46:00,226,That is a tragedy   my condolences to the family.
317539,Handlebarz,2009-03-15 12:50:00,3790,Wow that is crazy I cant imagine how that would feel to be so helpless our thought go out to the rest of the family.
317549,Squid,2009-03-15 14:01:00,1656,Pretty sad indeed.
317555,lunkerbasshunter,2009-03-15 14:59:00,2585,very very sad news
317560,Roy,2009-03-15 15:22:00,13728,That father/husband was spending quality time with his family when this tragedy happened. I hope that his family and friends can give him the support he's going to need to get through this. It's not going to be easy at all I'm afraid.
317562,Moosebunk,2009-03-15 15:32:00,3970,Unbelievably upsetting to hear these kinds of things every year.
317570,HTHM,2009-03-15 16:05:00,4082,Here is a link to the news story: http://www.citynews.ca/news/news_32911.aspx
317582,Sinker,2009-03-15 16:54:00,8692,"Brutal. I really feel for that father.  I also read the safety suggestions below that arcticle, and nowhere does it say one thing about pressure cracks. Its the cracks that eat you up, yet nobody seams to mention it in any safety resources. There was probably TONS of safe ice all over that lake.  Sinker"
317584,FishOn,2009-03-15 17:08:00,136,My condolence to the family. Very sad.
317586,JohnAB,2009-03-15 17:21:00,178,A terrible tragedy that will take the father a long time to heal from. My thots are with him today.
317633,RuNnYoOzE,2009-03-15 19:51:00,270,thats terrible they should have more education on ice conditions! and possibly monitoring!
317637,misfish,2009-03-15 20:07:00,29133,Dont know how you would deal with that.Apparently another sad story out of Rassoue.SUV went through there last night.Still looking for the bodies.
317641,codered,2009-03-15 20:22:00,123,That is one of the most tragic things I have ever heard . A mans wife is his world and the child they share  is the greatest thing a man could dream of . loosing your world like in a splitt second .. My heart goes out to this poor soul  This brought tears to my eyes ... God Bless......
317691,Joey,2009-03-15 22:22:00,9122,"Very tragic indeed Lew.  My condolances to the family.  I just saw the news report and what bewilders me is the vehicle they were in, not sure what kind of machine personally, but they said they had their seat belts on     That seems kind of a bad idea to me on the ice.  Joey"
317702,camillj,2009-03-15 22:42:00,1988,"What a devastating tragedy !  My deepest condolences to the family.  I can't imagine how he must feel... I am sure I would also have wanted to go in after them ... but that would probably have added to the tragedy  The ice varies alot on those big Muskoka lakes ... can go from a foot to just 2"" in a only matter of yards its a scary place to be bombing around on machines at the best of times."
317707,ccmtcanada,2009-03-15 22:53:00,7971,Cant even begin to imagine what he's going through.  To read that anglers had to restrain him from diving in after them....  I would have tried the same thing...  Sad...very sad...
317735,Fisherman,2009-03-15 23:25:00,7201,"They said it was a UTV, the kind you sit in side by side, sort of like an open jeep."
317741,mistyriver1,2009-03-15 23:31:00,600,That's horrible.  I don't know how that guy will be able to get over that.
317814,Rattletrap2,2009-03-16 01:14:00,1652,"Very sad indeed! Joey, It was a side by side, like a John Deere Gator they were riding. These are called utility vehicles, rather than an ATV. The two passengers sit beside each other.  I was out on the pond this morning and can see holes opening up all over. I think the ice will be gone by weeks end if this weather keeps up. The bigger bodies of water could be even worse with the wind."
317817,danbouck,2009-03-16 01:21:00,4380,"Very Sad, couldn't imagine going through that."
317914,Gerritt,2009-03-16 12:16:00,6129,A bit more info on the mother and daughter..  http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/sto...y/National/home   G
317918,holdfast,2009-03-16 12:24:00,1813," Yea, especially if it was his Idea"
