We will be hitting a couple lakes in the Orlando area. Not sure exactly which ones, but Ill be sure to mention them in the report.  The wife and I are going together, Im hoping she catches a nice BIG one so it will give her the taste of what its like... hahah then she might be a little easier on me when I want to go out back home !  So its time for bed ( long day at Universal Studios ).... early rise tomorrow.  WISH ME LUCK !!! The report will be here tomorrow night !!! Hopefully with a picture of my fist down a fishes mouth !!!!!   Talk to you soon !"
