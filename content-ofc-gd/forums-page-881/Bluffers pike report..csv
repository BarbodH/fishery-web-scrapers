Here's some pictures:    Figured I try out zoom on my new camera:   For the record, the launch area still has ice as well. I didn't venture to the launch, but I could clearly see birds standing on ice a good distance out from the launches. At least I got some good exercise walking down from Brimley and St. Clair AND back out again. Ah well, maybe next time."

318068,nofrills,2009-03-16 18:00:00,89,"Well, I think I know the difference between water, and ice.  The only fishable water was near the bridge that leads to the marina, and there was allready a number of ppl there so I didn't bother. The pictures were taken just over an hour ago. Considering it's March break, the launch area was full of ppl and birds. I don't know, maybe it iced up a bit over night, but it was there."
