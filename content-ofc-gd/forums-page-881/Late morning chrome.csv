318131,Joeytier,2009-03-16 21:45:00,3990,"I decided sleeping in was in order, so I wasn't on the creek until about nine.  Even on a weekday, there was still about 15 cars parked on the road.  After seeing a few fish get caught, I finally tied into a fish.  It turned out to be a nice, fresh, 2-3 lb male, with a wicked set of teeth.  Just before I left I hooked into a nice 4-5 lb fish that thrashed around on top and spit the hook.   Both fish were caught on roe.  I only had small roe bags, and with the off colour conditions, I think I could've done a bit better with bigger bags.  I'll be back at it Wednesday.  "
318138,kemper,2009-03-16 21:55:00,2232,Sweet fishin.  I never do well there... Did you get a drift in at the big slow bend just upstream from there?
318141,Joeytier,2009-03-16 22:00:00,3990,"Thanks. And no, there was people on the hole when I arrived and when I left.  I don't like to barge in on people.  Not that ever seems to stop some other people though."
318143,kemper,2009-03-16 22:02:00,2232, Haha no kidding man  Have you explored that spot down down to the lake? There is some nice holes in the lower reaches...one in particular that I plan to stop in at on my way out east friday morning  good luck
318144,Joeytier,2009-03-16 22:06:00,3990,I've gone as far as that big log jam.  Doesn't the trail stop after that?

318146,kemper,2009-03-16 22:08:00,2232,"  Yep, but you can bash in farther"
318151,Joeytier,2009-03-16 22:16:00,3990,"I'd rather fish upstream now that it's getting into spring, and large numbers of fish are probably already quite a ways upstream."
