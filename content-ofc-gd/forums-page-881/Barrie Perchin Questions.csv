317461,duckdog,2009-03-15 01:55:00,162,"Going to visit my brother this Monday, can anyone tell me a easy to park/walk out area for some perch right in Barrie?  Thanks guys"
317474,Fisherman,2009-03-15 02:18:00,7201,"No guarantees, but you can try the Barrie Marina on Lakkeshore Dr, lots of parking."
317488,Cudz,2009-03-15 02:37:00,2652,Whitefish and lake trout I cannot help you with but I do know a couple of easy access spots for perch. You can fish just outside the Marina if you want. I would try south of the fountain.  There are a few humps there and a wreck as well.  About 150 yrds off shore.  Fish the North shore off Kempenfelt drive.  There is a small park. Easy park and walk except for a steep decent to the lake.  Fish about 30ft of water  about 200 yrds off shore.  You might hook into a pike there as well.

317499,Cudz,2009-03-15 02:56:00,2652,lol That has been my spot since 1985 summer and winter!
317501,kickingfrog,2009-03-15 02:59:00,8333," No worries about whitefish and lake trout, they close on Sunday the 15th (Beware the ides of March). All good spots mentioned above, although that spot out from the fountain can be tricky because the outflow from the water treatment plant can/does make the ice thiner."
317508,misfish,2009-03-15 03:34:00,29133," Walked out this evening and all was fine.Also there are signs to warn ya where not to go. 30 Yards out yer safe. Hell ,ya dont even have to go that far out."
317519,duckdog,2009-03-15 10:00:00,162,"Awesome guys, thank you very much, I dont get to see my bro very much and we both love fishing this will be a treat, one more question, is there a place near by for minnows or should I bring some from up here?"
317528,Cudz,2009-03-15 11:44:00,2652,I know it closes today.  I just pitched a shutout all season with regards to lakers and whities so I am NO authority on them.
317536,Fisherman,2009-03-15 12:36:00,7201,"Bring minnows from somewhere else, apparantely Lou Simcoe Bait is out and won't get anymore fora while."
317818,duckdog,2009-03-16 01:22:00,162,Well thanks for all the help but looks like my bro bailed on me so now I am going to find a lake to hit here in the N bay area
