318055,eze76,2009-03-16 17:40:00,70,Does anyone got a link on an ontario boating license and what i need??
318056,ohhenrygsr,2009-03-16 17:43:00,947,"well you can do the test online if you wish, http://www.boaterexam.com/canada/corporate...0010619-en.aspx  But what i would do is go to the sportsman show this weekend and take the test it's a lot cheaper.  I'm sure they will have a booth set up http://www.sportshows.ca/Toronto/index.html"
318057,eze76,2009-03-16 17:46:00,70,"Well what else do i need, i don't need to do no tests on the water.   Yeah i was thinking about going down."
318058,ohhenrygsr,2009-03-16 17:46:00,947,Just looked on the website for you it looks like http://www.boaterexam.com/canada/ will be at the show
318060,eze76,2009-03-16 17:48:00,70,Alright is that all i need to use a boat or?
318066,ohhenrygsr,2009-03-16 17:56:00,947,Yea it is.  I would pick up a boating book i think you can get it at canadian tire. there is no test on the water just true/false and multiple choice questions.  36 questions (multiple-choice) 75% needed to pass (27/36) Print a temporary card when you pass Permanent Card mailed to you in three weeks FREE retries!  Boat exam has a study guide http://www.boaterexam.com/canada/education/default-en.aspx  it's pretty much all you need to prepare yourself for the test.  When your done the test you'll think it was a joke lol
318067,eze76,2009-03-16 17:59:00,70,What about the Pleasure Craft Operator Card ??
318070,ohhenrygsr,2009-03-16 18:02:00,947, that card is your boating license
318072,eze76,2009-03-16 18:04:00,70,Oh snap for real lol ok gotcha now
318236,POLLIWOGG,2009-03-17 00:58:00,835,"There is no license, just the operators card. The Canadian Power And Sail Squadron will probably be at the TO sportsman show or any local show or you can contact them locally, cost around $30, 50 questions and the card is good in most of the US. as well."
318524,eze76,2009-03-17 18:15:00,70,LOl awesome i thought you had to do a test like a drivers license test lol
