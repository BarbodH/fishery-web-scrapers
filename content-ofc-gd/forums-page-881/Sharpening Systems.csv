317548,PERCHER,2009-03-15 13:49:00,787,Mike I  see the fish I sent you finally arrived.
317629,dsn,2009-03-15 19:46:00,1018,I picked up a Chiefs Choice 110 from basspro few years back it is still works great. Sharpens everything from full size Samurai Swords to the small pocket knives. But it did cost me about $100 bucks and is worth it still going strong   DSN
317797,holdfast,2009-03-16 00:47:00,1813,   OOps  Wrong Quote  I meant the easy sharp at Canadian Tire thats on sale. Yup they work great.   I was in Mtl two weeks ago and picked up 10 made in Japan fillet Knives at the Dollerama store $1 each.
317798,Greencoachdog,2009-03-16 00:53:00,8163, ... but you squawk aboot the made in China Buck knives? 
317803,holdfast,2009-03-16 01:03:00,1813," You betcha, when I picked up that Buck knife that was cleverly packaged hiding the made in China, it disappointed me.  Well at least my Chicago cutlery folding fillet knife made in USA makes up for it.  The dollar fillet knives are actually pretty sharp.  Not sure how they will sharpen, but for a buck, even if its disposable what the hoot."
317809,Greencoachdog,2009-03-16 01:10:00,8163, The Nippon do have a way with steel eh!
317825,holdfast,2009-03-16 01:39:00,1813, LOL nice coverup.  I like it.
317103,Mike the Pike,2009-03-14 00:27:00,3421,Ok folks I need to know if someone has purchased a good system for sharpening the good old filet knife.  The old fashioned sharpening stone does not work for me I know I am not doing it right I seem to make it worse.  That little piece of crap that comes with the Rapala is only good for the plastic recycling bin.  I bought this hand held unit that looks like a set of brass knuckles it worked nicely for a year and a half and that too also wore out.  So I don't mind paying a little more but I want something that sharpens my knife so I can sizzle thorugh those filets.  BTW I have the electric Rapala knife which is amazing and I do love it but sometimes its not worth it to take it out for a couple of fish.  Mike
317125,BillM,2009-03-14 01:06:00,17367,Those simple plastic V sharpeners are great...  Oil up the blade a bit before hand and it's easy to keep it razor sharp.
317128,Leecher,2009-03-14 01:16:00,7832,"Mike, like Billm said that little gizmo is for getting the edge back on your knife blade..... If it does not, I suggest you bye another.  I've had the plastic V sharpener for the longest time and when it's time for filleting, a couple of pass and I'm good to go.  How old's your knife anyway?? Jacques"
317129,Fisherman,2009-03-14 01:27:00,7201,"I bought a Lansky Sharpening kit about 20 years ago, works fine for me, if you can afford it, get the diamond stones."
317131,Snowball,2009-03-14 01:29:00,167,"Take a look at this site:  Visit My Website  I purchased one of these units from CTC. My knives were all sharp when I tried it, but I could still feel it sharpening.  Regards, Snowball"
317150,Greencoachdog,2009-03-14 02:10:00,8163,"Throw that piece of junk away and get yourself some good steel!!!  http://www.gerberstore.com/index.php?xpage...age&xid=443  I have the 9"" and a couple swipes through the sheath sharpener before, during, and after each cleaning session keeps the blade surgical sharp!!!"
317151,Sinker,2009-03-14 02:13:00,8692,"I have one of those  small plastic V type sharpeners your talking about made by lansky. It has steel on one side and ceramic on the other. I ONLY use the ceramic side of the sharpener, and only once in a while. 99% of the time, I just use a steel to maintain the edge.  Sinker"
317162,Greencoachdog,2009-03-14 02:26:00,8163, Retneks prefer the ceramic... and that's prolly why Team #1 The Slammers are in the lead!!!      Whut???
317196,johnnyb,2009-03-14 03:41:00,3413,Go to Canadian Tire this weekend -- Rapala Knife with sheath and little plastic sharpener for $9.99!
317206,Sinker,2009-03-14 04:01:00,8692,You reading this Chickenhawk?
317207,kickingfrog,2009-03-14 04:02:00,8333,"If it is a good knife the edge can be saved by someone who knows their stuff. If it is just a regular ""disposable"" fillet knife, dispose of it and get another.  Wet stone to do the major stuff and steel to keep the edge keen after each session is all a knife should need. A bad knife blade is a pain in the butt, slow, wasteful and dangerous."
317224,tschirk,2009-03-14 05:26:00,261,"You may have trashed the edge, so it may need to be reground 1st, then I would use the Lansky V crock stix with sharpening oil...works really well"
317225,Maverick,2009-03-14 06:17:00,371,those Speedy Sharp's are on sale at CT this week for 1/2 off. Apparently they are pretty good but I still prefer the stone.
317244,Greencoachdog,2009-03-14 12:50:00,8163, Bwahahahaha!!!!
317279,Mike the Pike,2009-03-14 15:12:00,3421, Jacques my knife is 6 yrs old its the big rapala with a wooden handle I also have a little 4 inch model for trout and perch.  I don't use much only for Dore .Most of my fishing is catch and release.  I replaced the rapala sharperner and the new one has no effect.Perhaps my knife is too far gone or it needs to be sharpened by a professional.
317282,Greencoachdog,2009-03-14 15:27:00,8163," The Rapala sharpener is for maintaining a sharp blade, use it before, during, and after you use your knife every time!  Take a good pair of wire dykes and break the point off of your knife... then you can use it for a screwdriver!"
317288,Leecher,2009-03-14 15:40:00,7832," Mike I know exactly which one you talking about.  Those are good knifes and from what you saying, a sharpening from a professional is in deed required here.  Here's my tools I use for filleting.... and like you, I mostly do catch & release except for ""dore"".  This knife was given to me by my brother a long time ago and using the V sharpener every time before, during and after does the job very well.  Here a pic of it:    My brother was given this knife from Snap on company when he was a truck mechanic and since he doesn't go fishing at all, gave it to me"
317298,Greencoachdog,2009-03-14 16:04:00,8163,"I like those Kershaw knives Jacques!  I have an old ""exchange-a-blade"" Kershaw has a fillet blade, a meat cutting blade, and a saw blade.  I'm not really sure if Mike has anything to worry about.. he has to catch a fish before he can even start to worry about cleaning it!  ... but it is better to be ready if the moment should ever arrive!"
317306,Leecher,2009-03-14 16:41:00,7832," Yes Glen them Kershaw knives sure are one of the best ones out there... I simply love mine. The characteristic that I like about it is that the blade is not too stiff, makes for easier stroking along the fishes spine to get both fillets.  And I agree that Mike needs to be prepared when he finally lands a fish on ice LOL  Just kidding Mike"
317315,Tybo,2009-03-14 17:09:00,1373,"I use to be a butcher. Was A oil and stone for 30 years. Went to the lansky diamond rod. I don't have to steel the knife as often. This means the edge is not as coarse. Which in turn prevent the edge from rolling over, when struck or pull over a hard surface. cutting board,bone. Put the wrong edge on a knife doesn't help. You don't put the same edge on your fillet knife as your buck knife.  The lansky is a good sharpener. But it takes time to get use too. I practice on old knifes. It's not hark to destroy a knife."
317318,Burtess,2009-03-14 17:19:00,901,"I highly recommend the Spyderco Sharpmaker:  http://www.spyderco.com/catalog/details.php?product=77  You can sharpen or profile to a 30 or 40 degree edge.  Super easy to use, and super effective.  At LeBaron for $73...  Burt"
317452,Mike the Pike,2009-03-15 01:31:00,3421, I know one think Glen I will eat Walleye before you this year.      
317481,Greencoachdog,2009-03-15 02:25:00,8163,Those pics don't mean anything without the date displayed in the bottom right hand corner Mike.  Sobey's finest?
317484,kickingfrog,2009-03-15 02:30:00,8333, Dates can be changed to protect the guilty.
317502,Mike the Pike,2009-03-15 02:59:00,3421, We don't have Sobey's in Quebec .
