317656,fishinfool,2009-03-15 21:18:00,366,"I got out this morning with a bud (Newfieman) and we had a bit of luck at the warm water outlet. This would be my Personal Best Brownie to date, I put him at about 9 or 10 lbs. Got him on a grey and white Tail Dancer bouncing off the bottom with a real quick retrieve. Boy they hit hard and fight like hell, lot's of aerobatics too. We had 3 or 4 good solid hits each but this was the only one to end up in the boat. Of course he went right back in to be caught again!  Gotta love it!! Hope to get out and nail a few more in the next couple of weeks.  Stan  I also got a small movie on the camera of me catching it but I still don't know how to post it here. The file is about 7 and a half megs.  http://s5.photobucket.com/albums/y175/stan...outMar09001.flv"
