317810,Beans,2009-03-16 01:10:00,3339,"Just what we need...another carper...  The only reports of carp catches I have heard recently have come from the warm water outlets down Hamilton, Dundas, St. Catherines areas...  Maybe ccmt can take a look at the picture properties of some of his early season carp catches and give us an idea when Lake Ontario starts to produce...  Not much doing in the Kawarthas until late May...  I hope this helps...  Suckers should be running in the rouge soon...not as much fun as carp but still better than nuttin'..."
317877,CLofchik,2009-03-16 03:39:00,854,Where can you fish a water outlet in Hamilton or Dundas?
317895,Photoz,2009-03-16 08:55:00,792,"Not much carp movement until all the ice has cleared. Usually they head for the shallow protected little bays & backwaters where the water warms up quicker, first. If we have a warm April, Etobicoke Creek (west side) down near the lake & the west side of the mouth of the Credit starts to hold some. They're still a bit lethargic till mid-May though."
317951,Beans,2009-03-16 13:52:00,3339," I have only read the reports for those areas on the Carp Anglers Group forums for ""Canada""...give them a look..."
317975,Garry2Rs,2009-03-16 14:38:00,1425,"There is a carp barrier between the Bay and Cootes Paradise.  That's where I would start.  The barrier is under the High-Level Bridge, there's a path leading down...Follow Dundurn Street passed the cemetery, toward Burlington to find the bridge."
317980,Marko,2009-03-16 14:42:00,854,Never had much luck catching carp early in the spring. July-August and September is when i would start catching them consistently just about anywhere.
