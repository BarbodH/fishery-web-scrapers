It is a Bob Izumi signature rod reg. $79.99 on for $31.99.  There is only one and it is hidden a bit behind other rods.  There are other rods as well but none as good quality as this one.  Just thought I would give a heads up if anyone was interested in a cheap decent spinning rod."

317952,Cudz,2009-03-16 13:52:00,2652,Hey Bill I was at Mapleview yesterday and there was still one 6lb XL 1000 yrd spool for 6.99.  I almost bought it but I bought the 8lb one last week so I don't need anymore.
