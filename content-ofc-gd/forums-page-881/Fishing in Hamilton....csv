312943,rbaquial,2009-03-04 07:58:00,968,"Hey OFC'ers...  This coming Friday is supposedly going to be excellent weather. Was just curious if anyone knew if  THIS PART OF THE LAKE  is frozen?  CLICK THIS LINK  to see what I'm talking about. Anyone from the area, or fish in that general area can help? It would be GREATLY APPRECIATED!  Thanks! Rob"
312950,brifishrgy,2009-03-04 09:51:00,559,its part frozen part open water on the opposite side of the Hwy 403 ... would not trust it to be frozen solid enough to fish ( I need alot of ice to fish on .. I dont like swimming) ... better off going to the lift bridge or Bronte if you want to fish in the rain
312955,pikehunter,2009-03-04 10:30:00,1659,"Haven't been to that part of the city for a couple of weeks, I can say that from the QEW I can see that most of the harbour is open water and where Cootes enters it is open. Pier 4 park boat ramp area may well be still iced in."
312981,sonny,2009-03-04 12:25:00,511,it's frozen but not safe in that area
313016,rbaquial,2009-03-04 14:21:00,968,Is it good enough to fish from shore? (my buddy and I aren't much ice-fisherman)...??
313250,NAC,2009-03-04 23:06:00,369,"totally wide open everywhere...  just passed over the skyway an hour ago.  All the ice has shifted to the south side of the lake from Stoney Creek to Niagara, for now."
313373,solopaddler,2009-03-05 02:48:00,8605," Drive 15 mins down the hwy and fish Port Dalhousie in St. Kitt's, that'd be your best bet."
313401,rockfish,2009-03-05 03:33:00,91," Well the site keeps cutting out on me but maybe I can finally make a post.  The area where u have the marker on the map at Valley Inn rd would still be ice. I was at Cootes Bay last week which is ice and there was open water where it flows into the harbour but we had a bunch of cold nights and there is still lots of ice towards the Bayfront side.  The piers under the Skyway bridge is open water and if u were going to Port Dalhousie from Hamilton, it's at least a 40 min drive and that's speeding, lol."
313419,solopaddler,2009-03-05 03:47:00,8605," Speed limit, 15 mins, 20 max, no problem. (assuming no traffic)"
313423,rbaquial,2009-03-05 03:53:00,968, Can you point me to an area on google? I'm not all that familiar with Hamilton area... Thanks Solopaddler! (or just PM me)
313437,rockfish,2009-03-05 04:27:00,91,"The Port Dalhousie harbour is in St. Catharines and I've been going there since the early 90's, if ya can drive 55 km which it would be from the Burlington Skyway in 20 mins without speeding, good luck."
313454,CLofchik,2009-03-05 07:19:00,854,"The whole Bay is either still locked up or full of floating ice.  No softwater fishing (well maybe one tiny spot but I want to fish it first)  Bring lot's of lead if you go to Dalhousie, there's a ton of current and plan to get snagged up alot. And it's 50km from Hamilton, with lot's of enforcement.  Longer than 15min.  http://maps.google.ca/maps?f=d&source=...e=UTF8&z=13"
313773,jakey420,2009-03-06 01:00:00,4,It looks Like I will be fishing under the skyway on eastport dr. tom. looks real good.  
317881,rbaquial,2009-03-16 04:10:00,968,"Hey Guys/Gals,  I'm planning to go fishing around the  Hamilton Harbour  area on Tuesday - was wondering if anyone's been around the area to see if it's been completely iced-out yet?"
317884,RuNnYoOzE,2009-03-16 04:47:00,270,still be shore ice close to that area! wait a few weeks until we get a good thaw Id say!  Try it and see ...most often things can and might change over night!
318017,bdox,2009-03-16 16:32:00,329,"The entire main bay is open, the channel at Bay Front was still half clogged with ice, but didn't look too thick. You can launch at LaSallle in Burlington right now, or try the Yacht Club (Follow Bay St. past Bay Front and it's on your left). The water was really muddy yesterday."
318275,rbaquial,2009-03-17 01:31:00,968,Thanks Guys... I really appreciate it.
