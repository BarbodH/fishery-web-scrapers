318034,Cudz,2009-03-16 17:03:00,2652,Just got back from Simcoe Bait and Tackle to see if they still had minnows for my outing tomorrow.  They do have both small and mediums.  Someone earlier mentioned that they do not have any more small minnows but they do.  Just thought I would post this because some people are having a hard time getting minnows at the moment.

318118,Guest gbfisher,2009-03-16 20:57:00,0,"No knots here..  ... but I do respect the ones who don't make things up and tell it like it is.  Minnows on Simcoe are not needed. Havent been skunked once this year on the Lady. Even my 7 year old Son has it down pat. Now we're just talking Simcoe here. Other lakes I wouldnt put a line down with out bait and if Simcoe B&T were the only ones selling. I'd buy from them. Then again, there are other ways....lol...."
