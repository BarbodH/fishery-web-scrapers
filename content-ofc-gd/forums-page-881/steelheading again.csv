318103,MJL,2009-03-16 20:19:00,2427,Absolute stunner Silvio!  Some of the biggest fish I've ever seen have come from that river (Including my PB).  A job well done...Congrats
318182,bbnotty,2009-03-16 23:22:00,93,Massive steely and a few nervous moments as it showed itself from under the slush and came to the net. Hey bud i wonder what you would have done to me if i had muffed the net job eh.
318255,msp,2009-03-17 01:12:00,1336,"Beauty fish dude !!!!!!!  I have seen lots of 20 # steelhead over the years on eastern tribs. It just goes to show that the grass is not always greener on the other side. I would be very shocked if any body can show me a L.Erie fish that big. No more calling these rivers ""ditches"" any more.  LONG LIVE THE NORTH SHORE OF LAKE O !!!!!!"
318259,BillM,2009-03-17 01:15:00,17367,"Find a Lake E trib that has a naturally sustained population of fish and I'm sure you wouldn't have to much of a problem  I don't care what eats my roebag, 20lb monster or 3lb chromer.."
318345,silverstreak,2009-03-17 03:30:00,146,MONSTER BUCK. Very nice
318367,Bly,2009-03-17 10:11:00,1556,Congrats Silvio!!   Definitely a fish to remember
318409,limeyangler,2009-03-17 13:36:00,5204,"Great report Silvio, that big one is awesome...keep up the good 'work'"
318422,Steel28,2009-03-17 14:22:00,160,"Silvio, nice steel tank!"
318431,silvio,2009-03-17 14:52:00,433,Thanks Bly I dont think all ever forget that fish.  Stan my brother let me know what your doing this weekend. I am heading out tomo most likely for a bit before they blow out if you want to join me the offers there bud.
318435,Steel28,2009-03-17 15:02:00,160,"  will let you know bud, thanks"
317673,silvio,2009-03-15 21:49:00,433,"Its been a few good days of steelheading.  Friday I decided to start march break early and head out steelheading with Berge. We talked the night before and agreed to fish a river I’ve never fished and that he hasn’t in a very long time.  I woke up at 4:30am packed my truck and was off to grab Berge. After the hour and half drive we were there  but not pleased.  The river was flowing thick slush, we decided to try anyways. It was hard to get your setup in slush pockets the size of basketballs but when we did we were rewarded. All fish that we got at this river handed us are   . After a few hours the slush had backed up over the spot so we packet it in and left to explore. We went to 2 other rivers with no luck. It was getting late in the day and we had time for one last river. We talked it out and decided to hit up a river that left us with a sour taste in our mouth last time we were there. We got to the river headed down and it wasn't long before Berge got one. I had forgotten the net so I was forced to go waist deep in water trying to land his fish, after a few grabs of the tail she finally spit the hook. I got back onto the bank and started drifting.  Within a few drifts I had one on and managed to land it.    Berge was up next with this one     I followed with this    Me trying to land a fish.    After these fish we lost 2 more it was getting late so we called it a day.  With the good fishing we decided to head out again Saturday. We got to the same first river Saturday that we did Friday. The slush had cleared a lot which looked promising. I set up and it wasn’t long I found myself yelling FISH ON followed by coming down…way down … way way way down… followed by a few chosen words when she broke me off. Needless to say I had a great day hooking but not so much landing going 2 for 10.    Although the landing ratio was pour I made up for it by landing this pig, hog, cow, whale, anything else you want to call it.         We headed out today hoping for another good day but it wasn’t meant to be. I went 0 for 1 Dave got a few shakers along with Berge.     I will never forget this fish, and Berge’s beautiful net job."
317676,ccmtcanada,2009-03-15 21:51:00,7971,Some great fish there...and that was a hog for sure!  Congrats on getting out there...you guys did well.  Great to see you back in action after the problems you had last year...awesome report Silvio!

317686,kickingfrog,2009-03-15 22:17:00,8333,Great day!!!  Nice Buck!!!
317708,camillj,2009-03-15 22:55:00,1988,Beauty fish !  You need to adjust your date stamp on your camera ... looks like thos pics are a couple years out of date
317711,silvio,2009-03-15 22:58:00,433,LOL I know.
317721,Leecher,2009-03-15 23:08:00,7832,Great report and pics silvio Must of been an adrenaline rush to land that pig..... congratulations  Now you got to change your avatar with an excellent choice of pics!! Thanks for sharing Leechman
317768,jwl,2009-03-16 00:13:00,1056,"right on, that's a nice one, it's that time of eyar where the fish in the teens are coming out to frollic"
317789,KelfuN,2009-03-16 00:30:00,246,great seeing you friday man! that last fish is a monster..how did you land that??lol
317792,BillM,2009-03-16 00:38:00,17367,"Good job Sil!!!!!!  that is a pig!!!!!!!!  I got my ass kicked by the wind and cold on Sat, then had to change a waterpump in the gf's car today.  So much for my weekend of steel, lol  We'll have to get out again and lay a beating on them"
317806,okumasheffield,2009-03-16 01:06:00,318,That is not a fish! too big to be a fish!
317849,HTHM,2009-03-16 02:20:00,4082,"I opened this looking for a pic to fill my screen, all the pics are the same size.....what gives? So much for the huge fish pic.  .  That is a nice sized fish in the pic though..."
317851,Paulus,2009-03-16 02:23:00,522,"Great post and pics, Silvio. It was nice meeting another OFC'er, on Saturday. Glad to see you getting out!  p.-"
317861,The Urban Fisherman,2009-03-16 02:49:00,2050,"lol love the kicks! Sportin' the Puma's for some giant steelhead action.  And WHITE to boot! haha  Nice fish guys...keep slammin' them.  cheers, UF"
317862,OhioFisherman,2009-03-16 02:51:00,6623,"Great fish! A question, fish in the 2nd 2 pics, the heads look blunter than the big fish, all that I have seen here look like the bigger one but a good bit smaller. More of a longer jaw."
317878,kickingfrog,2009-03-16 03:42:00,8333, I think what you're referring to is the male/female thing. Mature male steelhead will start to develop a kipe (that whole jaw/mouth change) and show more colour when they are running the rivers for the spawn.
317908,solopaddler,2009-03-16 11:20:00,8605,Silvio very impressive fish! Did you manage to put a tape measure on it?
317941,silvio,2009-03-16 13:32:00,433,Hey mike put it up against my rod and measured at home it came in at 37 inches. I was impressed with myself to say the least.  It was nice to meet you as well Paul hopefully we can share a few drifts in the near future.  Hey cliff I am happy my wrist healed well but it gives me a ton of problems while out on the tribs hopefully I can find something to help. We were on the same trib yesterday Dave told me he saw you were going to have to meet up soon and put faces to our names.  Thanks everyone for the nice comments.
317944,Paulus,2009-03-16 13:43:00,522," 37""! crikey! That beats my pb by at least 3! Well done, indeed. You might have missed those others, but obviously they were a warm up for this one. Good job landing the monster  http://www.myoan.net/fishing/weight_calc.html  according to the fish weight calculator, if it had a girth of 20"" then it was in the 18.5 lb range. I hate to tell you, but it's all downhill from here - your only good chance at bigger than that is out west! lol!  p.-"
317953,solopaddler,2009-03-16 13:58:00,8605,"Was thinking 18ish myself, awesome fish."
317962,kemper,2009-03-16 14:08:00,2232,"Dangit Sil,  I was just feeling good about the 34"" I caught two weeks ago and you come on here with a 37....where I do find one of THOSE  Fishin this weekend? Im gonna be out friday, and and probably sat and sunday as well"
318035,jdmls,2009-03-16 17:03:00,575,Here's the action shot 1 got on my camera  What a hog Dude .... waita set the bar for this season !! or should I say until next weekend  
318054,silvio,2009-03-16 17:38:00,433,Hey Dave we need to talk tonight so we can get out one day this week after your done work. I am going north for a few days of northern steel since I am on march break. This weekend should be fun hopefully we rail them lol.
318101,tributaryhunter,2009-03-16 20:11:00,108,I was down that area on sun mourn and the three of us got 4 and died off around 10 nice fish
