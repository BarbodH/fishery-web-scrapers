After heading out to 80+ feet of water & setting up things started happening. I quickly had a fish on shortly followed by another. Not long after things slowed down for our group of three. 3 total whities for the 3 of us. Marking lots of fish which would come up & look at our baits but would not hit. Moved 3 times and tried many types of baits with same results. Finally moved in for a few perch to close off the day. Here's the two I caught to start the day.  Largest was 27"" and 6 1/4 lbs.  Best Wishes: Rick"
