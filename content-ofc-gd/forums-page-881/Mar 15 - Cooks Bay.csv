318081,Uncle Buck,2009-03-16 18:39:00,1000,"Went out to Cooks Bay with one of my customers who's never ice fished...  Beauty day to be out, 3 things though,  1. Should have left the hut in the Envoy  2. Should have brought the 4.5"" auger and left the 8"" at home  3. Should have bought minnows  on the ice for 7:30 and off by 3:30...  worked various depths 22, 9, 19, 31  it was a slow pick at them...  all fish were released to fight another day  Great day to be out except for the sunburn..."
318090,Terry,2009-03-16 19:12:00,14456,"well you picked a good day to get out, I guess you didn't need a hut............"
318126,Joeytier,2009-03-16 21:26:00,3990,I've been there.  Drilling through 14-15 inches of ice with such a big hand auger is not fun at all.
318129,Roy,2009-03-16 21:41:00,13728,Glad you had a good time Goran. OK now...HOW MANY FISH were released??
318132,Leecher,2009-03-16 21:50:00,7832,"Great report Uncle Buck  Couldn't ask for a better day that's for sure     I use a 6"" manual auger and it doesn't require much efforts in drilling them additional holes that is required throughout the day.  Live bait is not essential but comes in handy when the fish are finicky  Again good job and thanks for sharing Leechman"
318134,Joeytier,2009-03-16 21:52:00,3990,"Instead of minnows, for perch I'd rather tip small spoons with gulp waxies.  They last forever, as long as they don't come off when unhooking fish, and work just as well IMO."
