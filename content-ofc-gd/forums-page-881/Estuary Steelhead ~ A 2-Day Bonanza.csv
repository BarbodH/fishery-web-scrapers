318301,DRIFTER_016,2009-03-17 02:04:00,10439,I see you still haven't found any new poses.
318302,KelfuN,2009-03-17 02:04:00,246,"great report man!!! i love fishing that creek.  i was told the smolts are now in the creeks, was the lower stretch full of them??"
318305,solopaddler,2009-03-17 02:12:00,8605," Just for Sinker's sake (and yours) I had planned on inventing some new and bizarre poses.  Didn't do it this time, the creative juices just weren't flowing.  So what would you have me do?"
318306,jwl,2009-03-17 02:16:00,1056, ya probably couldn't becasue your ams where too sore from catching all those fish
318308,MJL,2009-03-17 02:18:00,2427, You could try doing the polar bear club thing and strip down into a speedo while balancing your rod on your neck and holding the fish...Surely the cold water on bare skin will bring out your inner creative juices.
318309,solopaddler,2009-03-17 02:19:00,8605, That would've been a perfect excuse but no I was just lazy.
318311,bigugli,2009-03-17 02:23:00,6138,Quite the successful daytrip. Some fantistic looking fish.
318323,solopaddler,2009-03-17 02:39:00,8605," Ummmm...no, keep thinkin'!"
318325,HTHM,2009-03-17 02:42:00,4082,"Thanks again, I really enjoyed the vicarious experience."
318328,douG,2009-03-17 02:44:00,2693,"You would be more photogenic if you were a girl,  that would really help."
318332,solopaddler,2009-03-17 02:51:00,8605, Once again keep trying.  (Sorry if I just squashed your fantasy Doug)
318333,Leecher,2009-03-17 02:52:00,7832," Here's one for you Mike.... The one harm extension pose, Like this one    but wouldn't want you to harm your arm on those heavy steel you catch  or may be a close up like this one    and that's just a suggestion"
318335,solopaddler,2009-03-17 02:57:00,8605,"  Ah yes the old one arm (also known as the Izumi special LOL!).  Good one bud, (at least I wouldn't be in a speedo or a woman   ), but fellow steelhead anglers frown on the gill hold.  I do like the 2nd one though I think I'll give it a shot."
318340,Sinker,2009-03-17 03:18:00,8692,"   I was going to say at least there are less pics of the ""pose""!  Great report though, as always.  Sinker"
318385,Paulus,2009-03-17 12:39:00,522,"Mike, you kept me waiting but you didn't disappoint.  With all those little shakers, it almost looks like a fish fry was in order. Ah, the streamside fishfry...   yum!  I have a pose for you to try...  p.-"
318395,Steel28,2009-03-17 13:05:00,160,"Mike, we have to talk lol Great report as always bud."

318412,The Urban Fisherman,2009-03-17 13:39:00,2050,"dude, you never cease to amaze me..... well written and beauty shots!  The fish are alright to I suppose...lol  Better than anything I read in OOD the other day.  Cheers, UF"
318429,family guy,2009-03-17 14:48:00,22,Nice day!!!  Now I can't even think about work.
318206,solopaddler,2009-03-17 00:16:00,8605,"A long time ago an old timer told me ""when in doubt fish low"". Now he wasn't referring to stance, but meant, fish as close to the lake as possible. Those words have stuck with me over the years and it's proven to be sage advice. On most rivers regardless of the season there's usually always going to be catchable numbers of fish in the rivers estuary. Whether it's fresh run fish that are staging or darker dropback fish, there's almost always something.... The added bonus of larger (albeit slower) water and more room for the fish to play makes it an easy choice, especially on most of the smaller watersheds (I despise small skinny water).  With that in mind my good friend Fergie, his 10 year old son Liam and myself headed for one of my favourite estuaries last Friday. The conditions couldn't have been better, the water was just starting to clear after a huge blowout and the daytime temps looked warm. We had good reason to expect numbers of both freshies and spent fish and we weren't dissapointed.  The last time we dragged Liam along with us he was really into it, this time not so much. Over the course of the 2 days he fished a total of 5 minutes. The rest of the time he spent crawling around in the bush by himself building survivorman forts and spying on people LOL! Ferg outfitted him with a 2-way radio so they were in constant contact (pretty good idea I thought), and by all accounts he had a blast. Kids, go figure eh?  Anyhow on to the fish. We both caught enormous numbers of fish, the vast majority being bright chrome jacks. Not huge, but a pile of fun on the long light rods. Just to make things interesting we were surprised every now and again by larger spunkier versions. No need to finesse these fish, we caught them on anything and everything. Most were tricked using thumbnail sized bags of fresh roe, but many more were caught on a variety of jigs, flies and small pink and white worms. The roe worked best early on when the water was still cold. As the days warmed up and the fish became more aggressive the artificials really shined. When using jigs and flies in such slow froggy water, twitching and occasionally popping the float every so often resulted in more strikes......and they were absolutely savage. Breathtaking really  .  Enough chatter, on to the pic's.  As mentioned the mornings were quite cold. There were still vestiges of winter to be found in various cool, dark recesses....    I thought this pic was priceless. I caught a fish early on and dragged it to shore to unhook it. After releasing the fish I turned around and this was the sight. I had just put my net down maybe 20 seconds earlier    Without getting into a detailed description for each pic I'll let them speak for themselves. Suffice it to say these are a fraction of the numbers we caught....it was surreal.                                                                 Great trip!   Cheers,  Mike"
