317566,spinnerdoc,2009-03-15 15:46:00,556,hi guys.. here's a lil project i have along with tying flies and them spinners. worked on it when i had time to spare at the shop...well there seem to be lots of that nowadays with what's been goin on the last few months. something to cheer us up...hey spring is here!!!!    
317577,brifishrgy,2009-03-15 16:40:00,559,Looks good .. the only thing I would do different is replace the socket heads with stainless hex bolts .. I have made a few thing for my boat and socket heads rust real quick
317583,spinnerdoc,2009-03-15 16:57:00,556,that's a good idea..we didn't have any at the shop at the time but i'll get some...thanks brifshrgy
317593,bassjnkie,2009-03-15 17:52:00,1101,Looks study and light. Very nice. Next step is to test it out.
317599,HTHM,2009-03-15 18:39:00,4082,"Nice job! The hex nuts are for adjusting the height, right? If so, why not weld a ""T"" handle on them to make it easier to loosen and tighten in the field?"
317614,Muskieman,2009-03-15 19:20:00,2472,You could miniaturize them and sell them to Ice Fishers.....Awesome set up!  Great Concept!!!   RFS 
317654,spinnerdoc,2009-03-15 21:06:00,556,"hometownhandyman, i thought of that but i tried the hex i found were enough to keep the strike indicator  and back posts. i used aluminum pipes and both aluminum and nylon inserts so the last thing i wanted to do was to over tighten them and they are easy to hand tighten. the bores are quite snug and gives a nice support. all the legs are screw in type, so the whole thing store nicely. danielm, yup i just have to try em out, i put my rod and reel setup and it looks good. and yes i was aiming for the ""light""  part, that's why i chose aluminum and nylon inserts with the exeption of the socket heads. thanks randy"
317662,spinnerdoc,2009-03-15 21:31:00,556,here's how it is disassembled 
317666,ccmtcanada,2009-03-15 21:42:00,7971,That's pretty sweet!! I've seen the prices of some of those pods...this is a very professional looking home made project...that's looks great too!
317695,spinnerdoc,2009-03-15 22:24:00,556,thanks ccmt
317705,Beans,2009-03-15 22:48:00,3339,"Much purdier and professional lookin' than mine...but it works...    Normally, I just pound in the bank stix but that is not always feasable...cement piers, wooden docks...  Big Cliff gets quite perturbed when I drill holes in his dock so I came up with this..."
317710,spinnerdoc,2009-03-15 22:56:00,556,thats a pretty cool idea and i'm sure it works. ha ha... i used to wedge my strike indicator in between planks on a dock
317832,Beans,2009-03-16 01:45:00,3339,Here's another idea I saw on a carp board...kinda nifty...    I understand the owner keeps his ground bait in this pail so that keeps the alarm stick steady...

317938,fishnpro,2009-03-16 13:27:00,93,So when can I place my order? lol. Thats a really cool pod and it looks nice and light. How much did it cost to make it if ya dont minid me asking? I am thinking of making my own now so I can avoid chasing after rods in the water.  -Fishnpro
318233,MJL,2009-03-17 00:55:00,2427,Very slick set up Spinnerdoc.  Great job on the pod.  A few guys in Hamilton have also made their own pods using various materials.  It sure saves you from having to walk around with a power drill when you want to get a set of banksticks into concrete or wood boardwalks
318242,hammercarp,2009-03-17 01:03:00,964,"Very nice, simple, light weight  looks good."
318272,spinnerdoc,2009-03-17 01:28:00,556,cost wise...well i had the strike indicator w/ stand originally. the main body and 2 legs at the front i got around $20(home depot). the rest are materials we had around the shop....it's the time mainly. i fabricated the inserts i used. it's my prototype. i would change some stuff later on but so far it looks and feels light and strong. i'd still keep it simple though. I'm looking into the materials and where to get them better.  thanks for all the props guys
