632541,Gregoire,2011-10-20 01:17:00,1397,"I know what a cougar is, and that a puma is older than a cougar, but I never run into mountain lions on ladies night."
632542,manitoubass2,2011-10-20 01:23:00,11391,"  Nope, Lynx are bigger, and generally have a different coat than a bobcat. I'm no expert, but I have seen a few of each, and I believe bobcats are far more common in ontario than lynx.  Cougars are def. around too, I've seen 3 in the past 4 or 5 years, two up in Ear Falls area, and one just off the dryden highway on cedar narrows. Pretty badass looking animals to see in the wild, thats for sure  "
632543,Nipfisher,2011-10-20 01:52:00,2449,  Looks like a lynx to me. They are much bigger then bob-cats.
632551,fishindude,2011-10-20 02:18:00,220,I think the Doc was hinting towards the pickerel/walleye joke that was floating around hehe
632552,Rod Caster,2011-10-20 02:27:00,5784,"Look at that, you might be right Dr. Sal. The cat in the OP's pic looks smaller.  Awesome photos Blair! We were never able to capture the lynx's up close."
632621,cjgraham,2011-10-20 14:22:00,104, hahah the reason I didn't add bobcat or lynx to my post is because Im really not sure. Its too dark to really see if the hair on the ears extend up at any length and the angle at which hes walking makes it hard to really distinguish the longer hair a lynx has around the face. Size wise there isn't much to gauge its height too. If I had a gun to my head I'd cross my fingers and call it a bobcat  . But hey same genus and very little difference in species.
632622,limeyangler,2011-10-20 14:26:00,5204,  AWESOME!
632634,Roy,2011-10-20 15:17:00,13728,"I'll call Canadian Lynx on that one. Very little doubt. While their ranges overlap, there are far more Canadian Lynx in your area than the smaller lynx (bobcat)."
632636,cityfisher,2011-10-20 15:33:00,959,"Thanks for the post! Great pics... all i get are deer, turkeys, and the occionsal bears on my cameras"
632639,cjgraham,2011-10-20 15:39:00,104,  I'll take a few pics of your deer please. Not one deer on the camera yet. Think it may be time to move the stand
634149,archie_james_c,2011-10-25 22:22:00,618,"  Deer hunting is not for you. Maybe you should take up knitting, and knit yourself a somebody."
634157,irishfield,2011-10-25 22:39:00,26272,..and then there's the night I slid out of the hot tub to go grab my camera in the cottage and she still didn't leave (Leah didn't flinch an inch left behind in the tub alone either! LOL)    Nip.. that first shot could make your brother some good money in prints!

632347,jbailey,2011-10-19 15:43:00,866,awesome pic!    always wanted to see one in the wild

632394,Spiel,2011-10-19 17:46:00,9065,"Great picture , not sure there are many of them floating around from trail cams."
632396,BillM,2011-10-19 17:50:00,17367,It's a Liger!!!!
632405,Remastered,2011-10-19 18:07:00,143,That's my cat. Feel free to pet it. It's nicer than it looks.
632413,craigdritchie,2011-10-19 18:28:00,1586,"A friend of mine had an interesting series of pics show up on his trail camera. Someone must have saw it in the tree and decided to have a little fun, because he wound up with about 30 pictures of someone's nekkid arse."
632418,Rod Caster,2011-10-19 18:44:00,5784,"Two years ago, a lynx showed up at my parents window and looked directly at me from 10 feet away. I was in disbelief and completely blown away. This was 5 mins from downtown north bay. Beautiful cats! Nice pic."
632420,NAW,2011-10-19 18:52:00,4022,That's awesome   Thanks for sharing.
632451,Rattletrap2,2011-10-19 20:28:00,1652,"That is certainly Awesome! I have seen some big cat tracks out back at our place, but never seen the actual animal that left them!"
632454,lew,2011-10-19 20:46:00,12766,"Gorgeous critter for sure and like everyone else, it'd sure be nice to get a look  one ""in person"""
632495,Dutch,2011-10-19 23:02:00,831,In the thumbnail view it kind of looks like a tiger - fooled me until I looked at the full size image.  I was thinking - man a tiger would be really rare to see.....lol.
632514,GBW,2011-10-19 23:47:00,8460,Nice pic!   AHH HAHAHA...  oh and sorry....
632519,Nipfisher,2011-10-19 23:56:00,2449,These are all from the Kenogami area just 2.5 hours North of North Bay. My brother took several of these in his yard.        Sorry if I hijacked the post.
632524,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-10-20 00:11:00,0,lynx are amazing animals but isn't the OP's picture of a bobcat?
632531,Dutchy,2011-10-20 00:35:00,416,"OK, maybe I am missing something. I thought the MNR said there are no big cats left in Ontario?  Or is that just the mountain lion?"
632539,fishing n autograph,2011-10-20 01:10:00,2540,Great capture! I've never seen one outside of the zoo! How far north was it?
632540,fishing n autograph,2011-10-20 01:12:00,2540, I thought lynx and bobcat were synonomous? Kinda like cougar and mountain lion
