633455,Bigworm,2011-10-23 22:22:00,119,"Put a solid days fishing in on Quinte this weekend only to end up empty handed....along with a number of others I'm sure. Fished the gap after seeing our fishfinder light up and wasn't able to get a single fish to cooperate. Talked to a couple locals and they said the same. Only saw 2 fish caught, one on a bottom bouncer and the other by ""U and Me"" charters. Maybe if he is on this board he can tell you a better story then mine but for us the livewell remained empty this weekend. On Saturday there were 15-20 boats and when we drove by today only 2. Tried everything in our arsanal to no avail.  Hopefully it is better when we go back in November. Attached is a picture of our fishfinder.  Mark "
633457,Terry,2011-10-23 22:26:00,14456,don't you hate it when that happens  I have seen the same hooks on the finder and they just will not bite  I am hoping they turn on by the 18th
633464,spincast,2011-10-23 22:49:00,3279,"Me and Frankie65 had the same experience last year. The screen was so full you just had to get one, but no...."
633467,fishnsled,2011-10-23 22:56:00,3520,Saw the same hooks on Saturday but we managed a few thanks to U and Me Charters. Report to come asap.
633646,johnnyb,2011-10-24 14:05:00,3413,I don't know if there is anything more frustrating than seeing the graph light up like that all day without getting anything.  Soon they'll be ready....  
633665,jimmer,2011-10-24 14:41:00,2730,Did you try after dark. I have heard that some do well in the fall by concentrating their efforts in the evening.
633669,manitoubass2,2011-10-24 14:52:00,11391,"Sorry to hear, always frustrating when that happens.  When I know I'm on fish, and I already have the depth/temp, off goes the electronics. Staring at that all day might cause some frustration, lol, and fishing frustrated is not the best idea, lol"
633675,Harrison,2011-10-24 15:01:00,2202,Don't fret too much Bigworm.  Alot of active fish are still deep.  Too deep for C&R.  Cool temps at night this week should help get things rockin.
633706,irishfield,2011-10-24 16:17:00,26272,Frustrating.. but I do know of a couple boats that were doing double time with multiply double headers on Sat and Sunday.
633752,Fang,2011-10-24 18:58:00,1330,"Saturday was tough. Was out testing out my buddies(FamilyGuy) new to him Ranger 621 (picked it up in Michigan on Thankgiving). What a sweet ride. I can't get in my crestliner again after fishing in that passenger liner for the day!!!  We got a late start and hit Picton boat ramp around 10 am. Fished till dark and managed to go 2 for 3. Met up with some old buds at the ramp GMAN (Gavin) and found it was a slow day for the pros too, early bite and slow the rest of the day. Talked to several who blanked and a few guys had 2/3/4 fish for all day.  Highl;ight of the trip was this surprise. Hit a Taildancer right after Rob pulled the planer board off the line. What a rip it toook and then peeled off a ton of line, jumped 2-3 times way back. We both said alomost at the same time - That ain't no Walleye. Nice male around 12-13. It was twisted when he was holding it, really thick and deep fish  "
633811,bdox,2011-10-24 22:19:00,329,"Had you been fishing the 1st annual ""slam the lamb"" tournament on Saturday, and concentrating on sheepers, you surely would have got some of those pesky walleye! Almost always works the other way around!"
