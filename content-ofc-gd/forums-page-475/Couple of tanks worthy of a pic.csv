Fished a friendly tourney on Saturday for bragging rights against a couple of buddies.  We fished G Pool and launched out of Little Lake. I have been fishing there a few times this summer and have done relatively well, mostly on the Little Lake side.  Saturday wasn't a numbers day as me and my partner didn't get our 5 fish limit but the 3 we got were enough for the win!!! a total weight of 14.5lbs.  The 2 in the pic were mine and they came back to back on a wacky rig senko fishing stumps and rocks..... the left is 5.9lbs and the other is 4.7lbs, the 5.9 is a new PB for me!!  I hope the pic works....... if not can someone help?  http://i1081.photobucket.com/albums/j356/Peps0618/lunkers.jpg"
