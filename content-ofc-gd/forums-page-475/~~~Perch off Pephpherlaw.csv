633685,oldphart,2011-10-24 15:22:00,665,"~~~What better day to be out there on Simcoe, Slug, Paul, and I headed out of the Glades on Sunday morning, with light winds, warming temps, and bright blue sky, this is going to be a great day to be on the water. As we left the breakwall I spotted the main fleet sitting out on the far shoal, but the Terns were diving and hovering just off the river mouth, so like always I followed Capt Ahab's advice, and went to where the birds were, and sure enough in 24' a large school just off the bottom, and like usual Slug was first with a nice Jumbo, and then another and another, well I was finally able to catch up, well came close any way,  Then paul started to catch up  Our top lure was a gold spoon tipped with a minnow. Here's a shot of our harvest minus the 5 dead Gobbies, and My cell phone that somehow landed in the well with the Perch. we took home about 15 each "
