633445,bushart,2011-10-23 21:47:00,2628,Hey Guys  The boat has not been used for some time now--prob 3 weeks to month  I opened the storage compartment lid--and there was a real bad sulpher smell lingering in there.  Both batteries are charged right up  Wonderin if I should be more concerned with them during hook ups now---never smelled that before?  Do Think they're on their way Out??
633446,Roy,2011-10-23 21:53:00,13728,Any sign of a leak in there?
633447,Roy,2011-10-23 21:56:00,13728,They might have gotten a power surge or been over charged somehow.....
633449,bushart,2011-10-23 22:12:00,2628,Hey Roy  Don't see any leaks---I'll check that tomorrow again--but nothing evident
633451,bushart,2011-10-23 22:13:00,2628,Also I did charge one battery up after the last trip--never used it after being charged
633472,Fisherman,2011-10-23 23:14:00,7201,"Sulphur smell is the common sign that a battery has been ""boiled"" or over charged.  I would think whatever you are using for a charger may be the culprit or one of the batteries has an internal short causing a problem.  Take them out of the boat compartment and test each individually.  Remember battery safety, wear goggles when dealing with suspect batteries."
633477,bushart,2011-10-23 23:24:00,2628,Thanks Fisherman  I'm using the onboard Minn Kota charger
633503,fish_fishburn,2011-10-24 00:47:00,1311,Before you do any more charging you might want to pop the tops and check the levels. If there a bit low top em up with distilled water and recharge. Good luck.
633531,Dabluz,2011-10-24 01:39:00,701,"  Also wash them with a water and baking soda solution, rinse well and then make sure they are dry.  High humidity and/or moisture on the batteries can cause a current flow from one battery post to the other and slowly discharge your batteries."
633537,bushart,2011-10-24 02:03:00,2628,Thanks Guys
633551,skeeter,2011-10-24 02:43:00,1907,Be VERY CAREFUL when working with batteries. I had 1 EXPLODE in my face when I was boosting a car. They do explode just like a bomb.
633590,Billy Bob,2011-10-24 09:15:00,5865,Lots of good solid advice here.
633599,bushart,2011-10-24 10:32:00,2628,Thanks again guys---will look into these
