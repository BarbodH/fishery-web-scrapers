633534,irishfield,2011-10-24 01:48:00,26272,Somewhere in the Ottertooth forum there is a thread on how to build one... and if you can't find it I'm sure a simple post as above will have the canoe lads typing (for something to do post season if nothing else).
633535,Pickeral eater,2011-10-24 01:49:00,155,That's the first place I checked as I usually buy most of my gear there.  They only sell the outback oven.  Thanks anyway for the quick reply. Bill

633760,dannyboy,2011-10-24 19:24:00,367,Here is a link to Kraiker's Baker one that you can build yourself with simple hand tools. We have used the Outback oven for several years and find it works well.  Dan
633774,kickingfrog,2011-10-24 19:52:00,8333,"  The Kraikers are the ones who I traveled with to the Arctic Ocean. We used the oven to make biscuits and buns... and a ""cake"" type desert for someone's birthday.  http://ontariofishingcommunity.com/forums/index.php?showtopic=41414&hl=Horton%20river&st=0"
