She suggested i call Garnet as she had been told by his wife that he was aching to get out. I called and he took about 0.000000001milliseconds to reply ...YES.  I had some errands to run and suggested we head out around 3:30pm.   Got a nice surprise when i got there...his wife and young son were also there. Michelle is my wife's best friend and their son is Jack's best buddy. Michelle hadn't planned on joining us...its just that Garret had got up late and was not napping.   Anyway...we got supper...non stop bite...mostly small ones tonite...but they taste sweet just the same if not better.    Michelle and Garret joined Garnet and myself tonite.      Garret is quite into his fishing too      One of the better fish tonite      Everyone got their limit except Garret....but he wasn't trying really       Supper was good.....     The End."
