634497,icefisherman,2011-10-26 19:48:00,952,"OK, Here is the question - I have some Yamalube lower unit gear oil SAE-90 for my 9.9 HP Yamaha 4 stroke kicker. Can I use the same oil also in the lower unit of my Suzuki 115 HP 2 stroke, fuel injection/oil injection motor? Suzuki calls for Hypoid 90 (what ever that is?!?)... http://store.brownspoint.com/detail.asp?product_id=99105-50041  Thanks."
634499,Fisherman,2011-10-26 19:57:00,7201,"Yes, same stuff."
634518,chris.brock,2011-10-26 20:20:00,4053,"I would go for it, it's a good quality oil"
634524,misfish,2011-10-26 20:24:00,29133,90 is the grade.  I always used Nautilus.Bottom end and gas/oil mix and injection.
634566,bigbuck,2011-10-26 22:21:00,2449, Just double check to see what standard your Suzuki calls for. It will be a combination of letters and/or numbers ie. GL-5 which my Volvo Penta outdrive calls for.
