Capitalism might be the best system there is, people have the opportunity to improve their lives through work and often some luck.  At the same time bad luck or laziness can sink you, but the system is being pushed into extremes, constant downward pressure on wages so we can compete with china and ceo's making 100's of millions while their company is being bailed out by the middle class, that is simpy wrong, indefensible.  The governement has failed to regulate these corporations, in fact they have enhanced the problem by reducing barriers to outsourcing and making it easier to bring in cheap goods from asia.  It is really complicated, but as an earlier poster pointed out, the idea of the american dream where you work hard and get rewarded is becoming harder and harder to attain, more of the wealth associated with that hard work is now being accumulated at the top of the pyramid while the bottom is being squeezed out."

633766,kickingfrog,2011-10-24 19:37:00,8333,"Sorry for bringing a thread back from a few pages ago. I saw this in today's Globe and Mail and figured it was relevant.  The Facts and Arguments section is unsolicited essays submitted to the paper.   http://www.theglobeandmail.com/life/facts-and-arguments/the-essay/yes-im-the-man-but-i-support-the-kids/article2209713/?from=sec434   By RICK WHITE  Yes, I’m The Man. But I support the kids  From Monday's Globe and Mail Published Sunday, Oct. 23, 2011 4:00PM EDT  I vividly remember being 17 in 1967. I wore bellbottom pants, a leather braid around my shoulder-length hair – and I truly believed that my generation would change the world.  The slogan “don’t trust anyone over 30” was not about ideology so much as our generation’s observation that once you had kids and a family, the aspiration to be rich (or at least comfortable) would supersede any aspiration to be fair.  Part of our momentum came from our parents, who seemed so out of touch – seemingly devoted to maintaining the status quo (and, in hindsight, understandably so). Unlike today, their status quo was not about protecting monster homes, private schools and German cars. It was driven by a need for stability after two decades of depression, war and uncertainty.  We dressed differently, our music became our anthem and we insisted on peace and love over war and hate. In retrospect it all seems naive now. Or perhaps that’s the smugness of growing older.  There is certainly nothing naive about what today’s youth are concerned about – unemployment, the distressing gap between rich and poor, the exploitation of cheap labour, the sustained war in the Middle East, the chemicals and pesticides throughout our food chain, to name just a few of today’s calamities.  I am wondering if I am still naive because, like most boomers, I forgot about our right to protest and demand change. I became part of what we used to call “The Man.” Back then, “The Man” maintained the status quo. He wore a suit and tie or a uniform – and had an uncompromising desire to keep things the same.  Part of it was inevitably moving beyond 30 myself and wanting to earn an income that could support my family of three kids. I work in the financial industry, having no doubt “sold out” long ago. But thank goodness there is a new generation who realize that the politics of corporations and governments are too closely aligned and that there are bigger issues to solve than next quarter’s earnings.  Today, young people are gathering on Wall Street and occupying our downtown parks and squares in the same spirit as their parents, who occupied university presidents’ offices or marched to end the war in Vietnam. It was an expression of freedom. Then, as now, the government had lost relevance.  But today’s protests aren’t an expression of freedom. Something different is happening. The media seem confused about how to portray this movement. Inconsequential or significant? Politicians are uneasy and I am sure we won’t hear any speeches about ethical oil or other spin-doctored concepts during this period.  The mission is not as clear-cut as it was back then. Even with the relatively weak world communications of that time, My Lai and Kent State came to express part of the fabric of what was terribly wrong. I am sure the iconic images and stories for this time will also become apparent. But it is so much more complicated. Collateral damage on top of collateral damage means that the real cause of any one issue of our time is difficult to identify.  Take global warming – it’s not just about burning oil or driving cars or the plight of rain forests or our reluctance to adopt alternative energies, but rather the cumulative effect of all these detrimental decisions. It’s not the protesters’ fault they don’t have a single message. How can you choose a single message when there are so many?  Personally, I am relieved that people are protesting. Many of us know that things just aren’t right. Capitalism shouldn’t come at the expense of democracy, and corporate might shouldn’t eclipse the rights of everyday folk.  I know in my heart that our tremendously compromised political system will not make the tough choices unless there is a groundswell of protest. I am sure I am not the only one my age who feels this way, though we don’t talk about it enough.  I bought into the Canadian dream of getting comfortable and somewhere along the way realized that comfort could be wonderful indeed. I never gave enough thought to all the social costs. But of course it’s now so obvious. In fact our kids, those who are protesting, don’t even know how much things have changed because they were born long after our pristine environment became so murky.  I fervently hope this wave of protests is not just an autumn season but the real deal that will form a coherent political force for the future. I also hope that it will become the voice of reason and the inspiration for a generation that needs to repair the damage of the past 50 years and not perpetuate our rationalizations. We need facts, not politics. And in good conscience we should be lending our best voices, our most effective media and our passionate belief in the rightness and timeliness of this movement.  I remember one of the anthems of my youth, a Janis Joplin song: “Freedom’s just another word for nothing left to lose.” The young generations of today have everything to lose.  Rick White lives in Toronto."

The people with whom I dealt were tightly held to constraints that governed the types of businesses they could invest in, and these people, charged with the responsibility of investing on behalf of others, took, and still take their responsibility very seriously.  Where the astonishing level of malfeasance has taken place in the financial industry has been in the corporate finance space that deals with the fixed-income and attached derivative industry in Canada, and the mortgage lending industry in the US. This is not news. The investment bankers involved have always been paid on profits, and that area of the business represents the final frontier of the industry. It has never been heavily regulated, and the players you're up against are some brilliant individuals. They have stolen from the ""Common Man"" more times than you know, and under circumstances that most people would have to work for years to understand. They're not the only industry to have ever done so, and yes, some of them should be in jail.  That said, the protest we see today is so fragmented, and so diluted, that to me, it seems all but pointless.  Now, back to the real issue at hand. In two weeks I'll be back up in Georgian Bay. I'm gonna stop off to see that real good guy who runs Mactier Bait and Tackle, and buy the biggest minnows he has. Do you think I'll be dealing with turnover by then?

632075,danjang,2011-10-18 22:33:00,148,"I am not very educated on how the global economy works but what would be the solution to this and what is the eventual goal of this movement? In my opinion based on what I've seen, it would appear that some of the protesters are expecting hand outs of some sort. The main difference (IMO) between here and the US is that our healthcare system is socialized. Medical expenses is the US is discriminating against the poor and even the middle class. What issues do we have here? If everyone were to live above the poverty line (whatever this is defined as) wouldn't supply and demand increase living costs due to wage increases and other processes anyways and start the whole ""flawed"" system all over again? I believe this is called inflation. So again what is the solution?"

632108,cisco,2011-10-18 23:28:00,597,"A worthwhile movement IMO. Here's where I hope the movement goes on to achieve.... Each country needs a 'council'....here a Canada Council made up of reps like gov't, university, industry, labour, to work with the public to set national goals... eg. % unemployment, annual new housing starts, gas prices/fuel inflation allowances, new immigrants, etc..  Gov't at all levels will thus have these as issues to address and to strive to attain during and after election. Voters can then vote for who has the best plan to achieve these goals. Canada Council would keep watch and if the party is just BSing then it won't get in next time.  This approach addresses many issues like.....now political parties don't have much accountability and each has its own pet issues while being wooed by corporations.  Canada needs a plan for the future. A blueprint. Right now it's just reacting to problems caused by corporations whose only goal is profit maximization. They sure have a plan.....pay the least amount to workers and make the most $."

What happen with the bank bailing out is taking toll on all of us at mass level, but it’s frustrating to see that people who were responsible for this mess didn’t held accountable in court of law, instead they were allowed to continue screwing us with their outrageous salaries, perks and bailout money eventually coming-out from our pocket.

632123,Rizzo,2011-10-19 00:12:00,4754,"...bingo. That's why I started this thread in the first place. After watching a few people get interviewed I realized I was watching a bunch of lazy people who would rather complain and protest than go out there and work for it. Couldn't even coherently describe their cause or goals. I'm not saying that's true for all the protesters, just the one's they interviewed! If you go out there and work your hardest, making yourself irreplaceable, you will be rewarded. Show up early, stay late, don't complain and keep your nose clean - at a minimum you will lead a comfortable life (financially). The problem is, most people nowadays see how good the previous generation had it and they want it immediately. They never saw the hard work that generation put in to get where they are. They want the lifestyle now, instead of putting in your time, working your way up, getting rewarded, and most importantly, being thankful for what you have, rather than worrying what the other guy's got"

Not to sound really complicated but the monetary system is horrendously flawed, and since we depend on that system for virtually everything, all is flawed for the most part.  Don't get me wrong, there are certain advances that definitely help my family and I live a little easier, but man, I think we need to take a few huge steps back in time to actually move forward and improve peoples quality of living.

So the message is not necessarily clear as a save the whales kind of protest.  One message that does stand out especially in the US is that the American dream is dead for many. Americans have long prided themselves on the fact that if you worked hard enough take some risks you can become wealthy, whether it ever truly existed I am not sure but the myth seems dead since they bailed out the banks.  As the banking community played high stakes poker and lost but instead of being accountable and taking the hit they forced the house (john and betty main street) to foot the bill while they were allowed to stay at the table and make millions more on their money. How would you feel if that was you?   I wish them well, as we need change, and it needs to start somewhere, and this could be the start."

Part of the issues start with people not having an open mind to how things in our country, and all over the world are operating. But, this shows that people are starting to really think about such topics, and are trying to figure out answers/solutions, as well as showing their displeasure in the current system.  The sad thing IMO, is that we are what we consider, ""too far ahead"" to turn back, when its actually the other way around.  Every part of our worlds systems are built on money, and whether we want to admit it or not, its true. And this pertains to education, health care, civil rights, war, poverty etc.  When goods and services were available for trade, and it was mans right to harvest the land, we were on the right track. When we allowed the so called economy to control all aspects of living, is where we took a wrong turn. And now like cancer, its effected everything.  IMO"

It's still possible, just people are too lazy and complacent to bother. Very few Timmies don't have a Help Wanted sign out front.
