Last week on simcoe my finder was giving really bad reads, the whole screen was clutter, lowered sensitivity but then I couldn't see anything. Not to sure what happened, transducer and everything is hooked up properly. anyone care to share/pm settings for the sonar so I can try em out this weekend, and rule out my transducer as the problem. Thanks"
634081,scugpg,2011-10-25 18:29:00,1373,I find these work in most cases quite well.  Fishing mode: Shallow Water Surface Clarity: Off Noise Reduction: Low Colour palette: 13 Ping speed: 15 to 18 Sensitivity: Auto (in most water should be fine) FishID: Off Transducer: HST-WSBL (for Lowrance Transom mount transducer) this is located under Settings-Installation.
634096,Dan668,2011-10-25 19:26:00,1120,"Hmm mine are very similar. Except I use manual, ping speed of 18-19. and low noise reduction. I was in 30 feet of water, even on auto and my whole screen was just covered.I could reduce the sensitivity on auto but than I'd get no definition on anything. Do these units have problems with wire interference?"
634100,aplumma,2011-10-25 19:39:00,6896,Go to their website and download the latest software. It has updates that have made my hds7 more accurate and refreshes quicker.   Art
634101,Big Cliff,2011-10-25 19:39:00,6899, I have almost exactly the same settings on my HDS 5 and I can see a 1/4 oz jig in 20 fow no problem.
634102,Dan668,2011-10-25 19:40:00,1120,"I have the lastest software. I know my settings are good because all season it was fantastic. I read something that if the wires are around other electrical wires, the signal gets distorted. Something i never checked though, didnt come to me that day. I was also using my hummbird finder on the bow, (hds on the console) at the same time. If they both operate at 200khz, do you think thered be crosstalk? But then my humminbird display was clear."
634108,scugpg,2011-10-25 20:04:00,1373,Do you have surface clarity off ? It can really mess with things if its turned on.
634158,Rizzo,2011-10-25 22:41:00,4754,"thanks for posting those settings Scugog, i was actually going to get in touch with you about optimal settings so the timing of this is good. Danbob,as far as electrical interference, it can really do a number. I had to reroute the wiring on my last fishfinder because interference made it non-usable."
634162,ecmilley,2011-10-25 22:59:00,2163,"i have the same set up bird on the front hds out back and havn't seen ant cross talk between the two, try switching to 83mhz and see if that clears it up or makes it worse. I also have the structure scan and this weekend the normal sonar was a mess showing hooks and clutter everywhere downscan was clear marking weeds perfectly ect i put it down to all the debris in the water from the blow we had and all the weeds dying off, let us know what you find out, don't forget there up to version 4.0 for the finders as well"
