633837,Terry,2011-10-24 23:43:00,14456,ok  I just set up an account to see  the only way I saw to get a picture here is to be in your picasa album  click on the photo you want then you should see a larger photo then right mouse click on that photo and in the menu go to view image  then right click on image and in menu click on copy image location then go to your post and click on the image link above where you type in text and paste in lenk and click on insert image  it just worked for me
633838,mercman,2011-10-24 23:44:00,7054, Congrats !!!! You just helped me ruin another keyboard Thank god they are on special at Staples.Ya silly man.
633840,Terry,2011-10-24 23:46:00,14456,what it is the image I used to see how to upload an image..LOL  not everything I do is just for giggles well not completely...LOL
633843,mercman,2011-10-24 23:50:00,7054, You sure you didnt take part in any experiments back in the 70's involving Lysergic acid diethylamide. 
633844,Terry,2011-10-24 23:53:00,14456,well yeah but they were not the government ran experiments that we were involved in  it was more of a local privately funded brain trust  that only had a budget to experiment on the weekends
633846,mercman,2011-10-24 23:58:00,7054,"Whew.....thats good to know, cause that green and purple graphic makes my retinas itch"
633847,Terry,2011-10-25 00:03:00,14456,yeah that photo has no moving part  if it seems to move then you are having a flash back..  cool there it goes moving again
633850,mercman,2011-10-25 00:06:00,7054,"i can feel the tiny sinews behind my eyes, bunching up into knots.....palomar knots.  Now to the OP, open an account with Photobucket, upload your photos there, then add the link to your photos in your posts.Thats about the simplest way to do it.  now i have to go get my eyeballs re aligned thanks to Uncle Terry."
633851,newb09,2011-10-25 00:08:00,49, Thanks a lot.. I will try your steps..before I saw your response I was able to just drag the pic from picasa
633852,newb09,2011-10-25 00:10:00,49, Actually it make me feel kind of High or hypnotized
