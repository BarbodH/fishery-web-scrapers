633317,irishfield,2011-10-23 02:25:00,26272,"Well it was just about a year to the week since Jen was diagnosed with bone cancer....    ..and Leah and I finally had the time to go North to pretend it was summer at camp (and to close up what we haven't used). We got delayed by another day, thanks to the bulldozer fiasco, and didn't get to leave until Wednesday morning.. missing a beautiful day on Tuesday to get out to camp. Unfortunately mother nature didn't wanna make it easy for us and we drove up thru rain from Parry Sound on. We did get a small window thankfully and it stopped raining long enough to get the boat in the water, motor on,      ..boat loaded and across the lake to our island. Important stuff inside and the sky opened up again.... and continued to do so for 10 days.  There was a lot of this.. ""Sun Dance"".    And a little of this..    ..and some more of this..    ....and then some of this..    Oh... and always be sure to have a complete first aid kit around...    Then we saw a bit of blue sky and bundled up and headed out. No Leah's not fat... she's just wearing 8 layers of clothes!    We managed about 3 hours on the water before mother nature chased us back in. 40K gusts and 2C with heavy rain. Not good for a gal with lung issues out in a 12'r, but she's a champ. Everyone should have a mate just like her, unlike most wives that wouldn't go out in that weather, let alone fish in it.    Amazing how much fun you can have sitting around for 10 days in the rain. Wasn't the weather we were looking for, but it was definitely a much needed time away. Now onto that year of backlogged work... oh and some serious Muskie hunting!"
633323,Roy,2011-10-23 02:59:00,13728,"Great report guys. A much needed rest and change of pace.  Oh, and about that dancing video. Keep it private...you have my email addy anyhow eh?"
633344,danbouck,2011-10-23 09:00:00,4380,Nice little vacation. Still waiting for the video link though
633346,Terry,2011-10-23 09:51:00,14456,great that you guys got away for a while
633348,spincast,2011-10-23 11:25:00,3279,a well deserved get away for  for you both. Bummer about the weather.
633353,HTHM,2011-10-23 12:31:00,4082,"Sometimes it's about the trip and not the fishing, I'd say this is one of those situations. Looks like you both had a good time."
633354,Jewelbee,2011-10-23 12:34:00,422,Looks like you had a much needed good time!
633361,woodenboater,2011-10-23 13:25:00,2277,"Sounds like you guys still had a great time in spite of Mother Nature although maybe we need to see photos of your rain dance Wayne . I'd trade a week or two of rain at the cottage vs working in the city any day, any time !  What I want to know is, who outfished who"
633397,Joey,2011-10-23 16:38:00,9122,"Nice to get away no matter what the weather.  So what did Leah do to her arm?  Was it that rough since you were so bored  Getting ready for 8 layers myself here soon for the BOQ trip  Even under 8 layers Leah, you look Maaaavelous!!"
633401,Tybo,2011-10-23 17:34:00,1373,9.5 days and Leah is in a sling.
633406,irishfield,2011-10-23 18:36:00,26272,"She slipped off the pole Joey !!  Seriously, her shoulder popped out of joint a tad and was clicking... so I immobilized it so she couldn't fight back!"
633421,The Urban Fisherman,2011-10-23 20:08:00,2050,"Awesome sticker Wayne!    glad to see u guys got away for a mini vaction!  Awesome place you have!  Cheers, Ryan"
633556,Moosebunk,2011-10-24 02:55:00,3970,"Place actually feels weird around here when you're at the cottage and offline.  Funny though, at the cottage for you when you're offline and it's raining, you get a little weird too.  Haha!"
633557,irishfield,2011-10-24 03:00:00,26272,"HAHA Bunk... you should know, you've been there to witness it !"
633578,Jen,2011-10-24 04:22:00,833,Sometimes it rains to keep ya locked inside together ... just saying  We all need that kind of time together ! I am glad to hear you finally managed to find a moment to get away together.  |Thanks for sharing!
633640,johnnyb,2011-10-24 13:48:00,3413,"That's pretty much all the rainy days you missed out on this summer, rolled into one trip.  Glad you guys had fun....I'd take wet cold Temagami over sunny warm city anytime"
633671,bigbuck,2011-10-24 14:53:00,2449,"It must have been nice to disconnect for a few days. So the weather sucked, big deal, you got to spend some quality time indoors and you did manage to wet a line. The two of you deserve some time to relax, you have had a very rough year."
