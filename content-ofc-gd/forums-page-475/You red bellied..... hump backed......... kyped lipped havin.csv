633686,S.M.05,2011-10-24 15:22:00,145," The awesome fall specs of course.  Especially the male specs with their full on spawning features. With their tangerine red/orange bellies, their puffed up backs and lets not forget their kyped jaws.  Well I canceled my trip out west   and had and as much as I had looked forward to it at least I had couple days of prime time to chase these beauts.    The face of rejection, a small girl quickly released in hopes of finding some brightly painted males.     In one week the trees went from this.......   â€¦....to this. With the trout feeding patterns turning on and off just as fast.                     GOT KYPE?        (all fish caught in stocked, yr round open, non reproducing lakes)  Judging by all the great replies on my last post I'm sure you'll enjoy these."
