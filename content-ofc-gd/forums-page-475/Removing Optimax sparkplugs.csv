This year I would like to do it myself but I have heard that removing the bottom plug is a pain in the Anybody have any experience with this?  TIA"
622169,mbac31,2011-09-16 23:16:00,904,"If you think yours is hard try doing 6 of them like on mine. Simple procedure. Google it and you will find nice videos of it. I would recomend buy a $27 dollar Hayes manual and doing alot of them stuff yourself. Dont buy the Mercury manual as it only reccomends Merc tools the Hayes reccomends normal tools. I just did my friends small opti and was done in under an hour, geal oil, plugs, fuel filter, stabalizer and winter cocktail etc."
622170,rob v,2011-09-16 23:40:00,535,must be the shape of the 75 - my 115 isn't too much of a problem - i winterize my own every year - in accordance with the owners manual instructions - never had too much problem getting my plugs out.
622176,HTHM,2011-09-17 00:37:00,4082,"In order to remove the bottom plug you need to take off the lower cowling as I understand it. I plan on having mine done by a pro, cuase he will check other things over at the same time."
622200,Roy,2011-09-17 01:38:00,13728,Same on my 60hp 4 stroke. Looked it up and did it myself.
622256,Billy Bob,2011-09-17 09:48:00,5865, Then you know it's done RIGHT....
622257,lew,2011-09-17 10:02:00,12766,I do all my own stuff too and find an articulated socket wrench can sometimes save alot of aggrevation for getting at the sparkplugs that are tucked away in hard to get at spots.
622293,Tybo,2011-09-17 14:49:00,1373,"Flex head ratchet,crows foot and a proper spark plug socket. With thees tools I haven't come a cross a plug that I couldn't change."
633484,lookinforwalleye,2011-10-23 23:46:00,4399,Don`t know what all the fuss was about that third plug was a piece of cake!
633593,Billy Bob,2011-10-24 09:23:00,5865, Amazing what can be accomplished in 5 weeks...  LOL  Now you know it's done right.  Bob
