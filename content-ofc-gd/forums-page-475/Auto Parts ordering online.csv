632755,Hooked,2011-10-21 00:47:00,891,"Just wondering if anybody here knows of where to order quality\and cheap  auto parts online?  I have visited some US parts sites and they can only ship certain items...or not at all to Canada. I'm looking for the following:  Left rear ABS speed sensor 2003 Toyota Highlander V6 3.0L AWD  There's a possibility of having to order more parts, since this part will be stage 1 of trouble shooting my problem...hopefully solving it though.  My shop wants $330 for the part, but I'm sure there's cheaper out there.  Any help?  Thanks"
632758,vance,2011-10-21 01:28:00,719,from my understanding the manufacturer OWNS the right to sell parts for their vehicles for 10 years.if this part was used on an older vehicle you might be able to get an after market one but I doubt it.   vance

632770,Dusky,2011-10-21 02:20:00,310,"  A coworker of mine usually get his stuff shipped at some Buffalo business, guys at business charge $5 service charges for each item."
632777,BillM,2011-10-21 03:41:00,17367,"Ship it to the UPs depot in Buffalo, go pick it up.  There are also all kinds of places that charge you a flat rate to ship something to their address."
632778,Canuck2fan,2011-10-21 03:42:00,1444,Try www.rockauto.com I have done lots of business with them. The price you see is the price you pay. No extra duty or taxes at the door.
632779,BillM,2011-10-21 03:56:00,17367, It's not up to Rock Auto if you get charged duty or not..  Unless you are paying for expedited shipping.
632780,Dutch,2011-10-21 04:14:00,831,Since you are in Stoney Creek - use these guys:  http://cbiusa.com/  I have used them in the past and it is really easy to find and close to the border.  Not worth playing around at the border to save the taxes on the way back.  Make sure you claim it coming back across and pay the tax.  The savings from getting it shipped to the USA will more than pay for the tax.
632791,Billy Bob,2011-10-21 09:22:00,5865,"I have used RockAuto with good success when I had my Ford Escape...check online and your part is $147.89.......I'm in the Buffalo area and if your going to ship it here, PM me and I'm sure I can help you out.  Bob"
632799,Big Cliff,2011-10-21 10:55:00,6899, I can see a new business venture starting up here: Billy Bob's fast freight forwarding LOL. Not only that but it would give you lots of excuses to come up to Canada
632824,skinny,2011-10-21 13:03:00,442,I have used these guys a fair bit in the past with very good results  http://www.autopartsonlinecanada.com/  even did a return once with them all was smooth think they ship out of T.o. area and they use to do free ship after a set amount
632850,Hooked,2011-10-21 14:36:00,891,"Thanks for all your input, appreciated.  I looked into all the options and looks like I can get the part shipped to my door for 212 from rockauto.com, taxes included...."
632855,mukluk,2011-10-21 14:46:00,196,Rockauto all the way.  Just ordered 2 wheel sensors for my Equinox for half the price the dealer was going to charge me. Genuine Ac Delco sensors.  Cost me $22.00 UPS shipped right to my door. Have used Rockauto in the past; no problems;  secure sight.  As Canuck2fan mentioned; the price you see is the price you pay. The sight even shows pictures of the parts you are ordering.
632869,bigbuck,2011-10-21 15:16:00,2449,"RockAuto.com all the way. When you check out, all taxes, duties and the like are included.I've bought parts from them with great savings and success."
632889,Hooked,2011-10-21 16:37:00,891,   How long did it take to get the parts typically when you guys ordered?
632940,bigbuck,2011-10-21 19:28:00,2449,"Rock auto will have them to you usually within a week, I had some parts in 2 days and some took 5-6 days. I can live with the wait since I'm saving large. If it can wait, definitely go with them. Remember, this is coming from someone who has a good friend with a shop and pays HIS price for parts, not marked up for the end user. I ordered an ignition coil pack for my car a couple of years ago that was $465 here (shop price), Rockauto had it to my door for $270. Guess where I got it from??"
634031,Hooked,2011-10-25 15:59:00,891,"Wow, ordered the part from Rockauto yesterday and it came in today!  Thanks everyone for your help."
