634097,adolson,2011-10-25 19:27:00,783,2011 Ontario Recreational Fishing Regulations state the following:   and   and   This seems pretty clear to me.
634098,Remastered,2011-10-25 19:29:00,143,I guess it gets on people's nerves for some reason. Pharmacy actually IS spelt with a ph
634103,NANUK,2011-10-25 19:43:00,797,"OP, keep them in the boat, down wind from yourself, thats like throwing them in the gas chamber."
634129,Roy,2011-10-25 21:05:00,13728, Leave him alone. He's not well. I think it's his PH level.
634181,Twocoda,2011-10-25 23:52:00,4130,you guys are being so fylisofical...
634261,Dabluz,2011-10-26 03:41:00,701,"  Is ""spelt"" and actual word.  I thought it was ""spelled"".  I think he spelled ""spelt"" rong."
634295,fish_finder,2011-10-26 12:53:00,370," well, spelt is a species of wheat actually...."
634321,oldphart,2011-10-26 13:49:00,665,"~~~~I im neever rong, may not be always write, but neever rong"
634425,Remastered,2011-10-26 17:32:00,143,Looks like we've been trolled by oldphart the whole time.
634430,oldphart,2011-10-26 17:41:00,665,~~~~~AAAAAAH it's been great PHISHEN here
634439,GoneFishin,2011-10-26 17:59:00,349,"The first gobie I ever caught was snagged in it's side. It was over 10 years ago when they had just been introduced to the BOQ. Every one around put up such a big fuss over the 3 inch long fish (maybe smaller) because no one had seen one before, and we had heard about the gobie being an invasive species. Every one insisted we kill it. We were camping at pickerel park and took the gobie up to the park office and they froze it and were sending it away to the ministry to be studied as the ministry had requested. They said to kill all invasive species, they are not worried about how you catch them imo. It was a pretty exciting catch at the time..."
634501,Photoz,2011-10-26 20:04:00,792, 2011 Ontario Fishing Summary . . .   Page 6  IT IS ILLEGAL TO: Catch a fish by impaling or snagging it with a hook through any part of the body other than the mouth - ANY FISH hooked in this way must be released immediately.  It would be very interesting to hear how a C. O. who dinged somebody for 'snagging gobies' would present his case before a judge!
634522,Remastered,2011-10-26 20:22:00,143,No C.O would do that
633977,oldphart,2011-10-25 12:46:00,665,"~~~~While out this past weekend I got into a large school of Gobbies, and of the 5 landed 4 were foul hooked. Now I know as a Phisherman you should release any foul hooked phish, but does that also include Gobbies????"
633978,Roy,2011-10-25 12:49:00,13728,"JEEZ No, gobies are not considered deserving of a life. They should be squashed with much vigor."
633980,BillM,2011-10-25 12:50:00,17367,"Throw them into the woods!  Or smack them off the motor like my oldman used to do with rock bass, lol!!!"
633982,Rizzo,2011-10-25 13:00:00,4754,"yes...release the head first, then sometime later the body"
633986,NAW,2011-10-25 13:24:00,4022,While we're in the subject of Gobies..  Is it illegal to feed a dead goby to a flock of seagulls while on the water?
633996,fishindevil,2011-10-25 13:49:00,6254,KILL ALL ROUND GOBIES !!!! THATS AN ORDER....
634000,BillM,2011-10-25 14:05:00,17367," Goby isn't a sport fish, I don't see why that would be illegal."
634003,mercman,2011-10-25 14:18:00,7054,"My wife thinks they are cute, so i release them in my hand under water.    After i crush the life OUT OF THEM  "
634010,tb4me,2011-10-25 14:47:00,3295,I spoke with a MNR guy at the spring fishing show this year about this.. They say that they would like you to kill them and NOT throw them back in the water. It isn't  law but this is the best method of disposing them. Myself I like to use them to catch big pike and bass. Only if its already on my hook tho. My neighbour up at the trailer actually goes fishing for them to use as bait for pike. He will fish the shallows in the river with a tiny hook and a chunk of worm till he fills his minnow pail. I'm not to sure if that is legal or not but he does well with them
634015,fish_finder,2011-10-25 15:14:00,370, Not a good move bud...  definitely illegal.
634016,BillM,2011-10-25 15:21:00,17367, Great way to introduce an invasive species..
634022,mercman,2011-10-25 15:29:00,7054,  Not legal.I was informed of this earlier this summer.
634024,Remastered,2011-10-25 15:31:00,143,Not legal.
634029,Whitespinnerbait,2011-10-25 15:56:00,2038,Gobies have rights to you know.....
634030,Remastered,2011-10-25 15:59:00,143,The right to get killed.
634032,fishing n autograph,2011-10-25 16:01:00,2540,The right to remain dead.....
634052,tb4me,2011-10-25 17:05:00,3295,not at all...he is using the gobies in the same body of water.just goes from 1 or 2 ft deep to 12 to 25 foot deep.
634056,Remastered,2011-10-25 17:13:00,143,Either way. Keep in mind it's illegal.
634062,oldphart,2011-10-25 17:22:00,665,"~~~~The question was if I foul hook them, to be a proper phisherman, should I release them??"
634063,Remastered,2011-10-25 17:27:00,143, no  Also phish is spelt fish lol!
634065,Roy,2011-10-25 17:28:00,13728,And the question has been answered. Gobies must be killed prior to their release anywhere no matter how they were caught.
634073,tb4me,2011-10-25 18:01:00,3295,"Actually Roy thats not entirely true. The MNR officer I spoke with said they cant expect everyone (women, childern and some men I know) to kill a fish. So if seen releaseing them they wouldnt be charged. They would be informed of the species and the risks...But you know how the opinion of one officer can vary to another.."
634075,skeeter,2011-10-25 18:08:00,1907,"CHOOT""M CHOOT""M Lizabeth  Merc man, I beat you to it!!!!"
634087,NBR,2011-10-25 18:54:00,163,If your neighbor is using them as bait in anothe3r body of waqter he is most likely breaking the law and worse could be introducing gobies to another body of water.
634092,oldphart,2011-10-25 19:16:00,665,"~~~~So it's okay to snag them, great, but what this that Phish is spelt with an F, next you'll be telling me Pharmacy is also spelt farmacay, some of uses guies spell phunny"
