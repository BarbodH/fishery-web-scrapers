633474,DundasSteelheader,2011-10-23 23:15:00,166,"I Got out today for the day to my favorite steelheading river with my old man . Today I wanted to try out using beads under the float for steelies. It worked pretty well I'd say, went 1/4 on the bead. Got a few questions:  1. I pegged the bead with a toothpick as tightly as I could, but the bead would still slide down to the eye of the hook when I set, how do you bead pros prevent this? Do you use something other than toothpicks?  2. Is it better to use beads with the fly rod?   Anyways, to the fish -  My first chromer of the season - about 4-5 pounds I reckon     A few for the old man who was on the fly rod today:          Thanks for looking"

633496,Rod Caster,2011-10-24 00:20:00,5784,Looks like a top-notch day weather and fish wise.  
633504,super dave,2011-10-24 00:52:00,323,Loop ur leader through the bead twice.  Then take the tag end and through the line that is on the outside of the bead three times.
633506,spinnerdoc,2011-10-24 01:04:00,556,Try this method My link  You wont be needing any toothpicks on this one
633512,DundasSteelheader,2011-10-24 01:20:00,166, Thanks spinnerdoc. Just a quick question - Does the knot in the leader not cause it to weaken?
633514,BillM,2011-10-24 01:23:00,17367,Great fish!  Those little chrome rockets are a lot of fun.
633520,spinnerdoc,2011-10-24 01:34:00,556,"No it does not,maybe to a certain point, but it's way up there in terms of keeping the knot strength close to 100%...not sure of what the number is...put it this way, you won't be loosing fish if you do it right  Awesome fish btw"
633606,DundasSteelheader,2011-10-24 11:30:00,166," Thanks a lot spinnerdoc, I'll try it next time I'm out  Thanks everyone for the comments!"
