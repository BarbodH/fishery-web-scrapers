Dogs agree that you have to raise your voice to get your point across.   6. You never have to wait for a dog; they're ready to go 24 hours a day.   7. Dogs find you amusing when you're drunk.   8. Dogs like to go hunting and fishing.  9. A dog will not wake you up at night to ask, If I died, would you get another dog??   10. If a dog has babies, you can put an ad in the paper and give them away.   11. A dog will let you put a studded collar on it without calling you a pervert.   12. If a dog smells another dog on you, they don't get mad. They just think it's interesting..   13. Dogs like to ride in the back of a pickup truck.   And last, but not least:   14.
