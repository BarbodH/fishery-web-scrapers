629640,Kayakmike,2011-10-11 11:17:00,20,Went fishing at Mountsberg yesterday and what a difference from June's water level.  I'm glad I decided to bring a pair of rubber boots as the new exposed shoreline and shallows were all mud! This also made things interesting at the boat ramp for a lot of people.   The fish seemed to be quite active...jumping everywhere....but they weren't hitting as frequently as I would of thought.  Or perhaps they just didn't like what I was throwing.  Landed two nice bass....and miss another two fish (bass or pike).  I also saw several decent fish but they were very skiddish and seemed to swim away quickly.  Parking lot was near full with a lot of folks fishing by the dam.  I seen other people with fish so the fish were obliging.  A beautiful day with hardly a breeze!!

629840,northernpike56,2011-10-11 21:04:00,717,nice report  what were you using to catch them? I was up there last weekend and the weeds were right up to the surface and the water level was down about 5 ft
629877,Kayakmike,2011-10-11 22:48:00,20, Thanks Roy!
629880,Kayakmike,2011-10-11 22:58:00,20," I think the real question is what didn't I try to catch them with  ...that list much shorter.  Mountsberg has skunked me on occasion in the past as well , but I'm getting better....earlier in the year I did ok with spinnerbaits but with the heavier weeds, weedless plastics seem to be the way to go as far as I can tell.  Haven't found the knock-out lure or plastic for this lake yet....but I remain hopeful and enjoy trying."
634269,kman,2011-10-26 07:41:00,15,Every time I go to mountsburg I use a silver Williams wabbler and me and my buddies make bets on who will catch the first pike. Usually get 1 in the first few casts
634283,Kayakmike,2011-10-26 11:52:00,20, Thx Kman...I will have to give that a go.  I typically go after the bass more than the pike....but I am often surprised how few pike I catch in the meantime figuring they would be a little less fussy....but I will be sure to pack a silver bullet next time out  .  Weather permitting...I'll be there this weekend
634472,kman,2011-10-26 19:01:00,15,bass fishing eh I know a sweet place for bass fishing. This place is literally infested bass every catch but they are all small I need a canoe to get to the deeper water
634485,northernpike56,2011-10-26 19:29:00,717,  My buddy landed 2 5pounders in one trip  I'd say that there was more big bass then pike there!
634509,Kayakmike,2011-10-26 20:13:00,20, A canoe...or perhaps even a fishing kayaking....be sure to take a look at those before settling on a canoe  .
634533,kman,2011-10-26 20:59:00,15,Mysecret place 5 pounds are normal but its hard not to get the small ones they eat every thing u throw
