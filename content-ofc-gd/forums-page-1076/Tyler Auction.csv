165173,Beans,2008-02-27 18:49:00,3339,Maureen has had a brain freeze what with starting a new position at work and all she missed telling Roy that there is another 1 person portable Fish Trap (like the one Tony B chose as his prize at the Tyler event and that there is an I-Pod Nano also up for bids...  Roy is up to his (you know what) in alligators but the items  should appear in the auction area soon...
