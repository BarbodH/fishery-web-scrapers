With the mercury dropping below -22 degrees Celsius, that idea didn’t last for long.  As soon as I had marked a fish on the Vex, it was time to pull off the travel cover and get inside the trap.  Once the heater was up and running, my fingers started to thaw out a bit.  Earlier this week we were a little worried that the cold snap might shut the fish down.  So this morning the fish were not very cooperative, but they weren’t shut down completely.  With a little negotiation, I managed to close the deal with this one.  Jeff  "
