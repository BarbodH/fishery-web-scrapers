166283,bramptonjerry,2008-03-01 17:52:00,132,waiting for the reel trade in...is it just my imagination or is the reel trade in less of a deal this year?
166290,tdotfisherman,2008-03-01 18:24:00,317,"By the sounds of it, by the time the reel trade in guys like me get out there, nothing's gonna be left.."
166335,Carp,2008-03-01 21:02:00,1488,Bought a couple of reels yesterday. Wasn't worth waiting for the trade in to begin. At least not for me. I would have only saved ten dollars and take a chance the ones I wanted would be sold out.
166377,Corey,2008-03-01 22:40:00,355,I can't make it.
