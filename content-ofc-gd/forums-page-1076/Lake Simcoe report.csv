The group as you can see from Shelly's report were already into the fish. we set up and no longer then 5min and my friend chris had her first whitie of her life through the hole a nice 5lbs'er we made out well getting 4 fish each and loosing a few more. I finally got a 10+ lbs laker quick shot and back down the hole. what a great day to be on the water. no definatly no shortage of fish      "
