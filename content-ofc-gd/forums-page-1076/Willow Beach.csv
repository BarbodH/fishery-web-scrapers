166001,fishnsled,2008-02-29 17:55:00,3520,Wondering what the driving conditions are like off of Willow beach?  Any pressure cracks that may not be passable? Thickness of ice is good for driving on?  Thanks in advance.

Out from willow you can get to the snake island shoal without crossing the nasty crack. I won't drive over it, but lots of guys are. There is lots of water to fish without going over it.......  Good ice (15"") and not much snow...so travelling is great right now.  Sinker"
