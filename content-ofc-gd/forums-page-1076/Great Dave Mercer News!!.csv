165610,mcallister.grant,2008-02-28 19:16:00,327,Congrats Dave! Good luck!
165626,kennyman,2008-02-28 19:50:00,737,"Wow, congratulations Dave. I enjoyed your seminar at the Spring Fishing Show as well. Always entertaining (or edutaining). Just wind you up or put a quarter in and away you go, stopping every twenty minutes for a breath (or Subway sub LOL) and away you go again. All kidding aside, you're a great ambassador for the sport and Canada. P.S. I still haven't seen my first full length ""Facts of Fishing"" show. I have the BPS videos and everyone has seen the ""shorts"". I'm looking forward to it and having more opportunities to catch the new show is all good."
165666,bigbuck,2008-02-28 21:14:00,2449,That's great for us who don't get WFN!!! I loved your seminar at the fishing show and thoroughly enjoyed lunch at Subway on you. Now I have something to watch on Sunday mornings now!!!
165667,Blake,2008-02-28 21:18:00,418,Truly awesome Dave.  You are doing all of us members and Canadians Proud.  I am fortunate to be on some of the same sponsorship teams as Dave and he truly is a great ambassador to our sport and the future of it.
165673,cityfisher,2008-02-28 21:51:00,959,Sweet ! when it first started on WFN i was skeptical but after i started watching it I really enjoy it !  Keep it going !
165693,tdotfisherman,2008-02-28 22:34:00,317,"That's great news.. I can't believe The Score actually picked up a fishing show.. That doesn't seem like something they would broadcast, but hey, thats sick.. can't complain about more quality fishing shows on TV!"
165709,motv8tr,2008-02-28 23:00:00,2587,That's GREAT!!! Congrats Dave!!!  Maureen
166048,Dave Mercer,2008-02-29 20:21:00,148,"Hi guys!  Thanks for all the positive feedback.  I am super excited to be joining The Score. It's awesome that they have finally decided to air a fishing show and even better that its mine (LOL)!  Just to show you how excited I am and my whole team of sponsors, tomorrow I will be doing a seminar at Bass Pro Shops at 2pm. Immediately following that seminar, I will be hosting a meet and greet with everyone and the first hundred people in the lineup are actually going to get a free 6-inch Subway sub. Who says nothing is free in this world? I hope to see a bunch of you out there tomorrow, Saturday March 1st at 2pm and please make sure to say hi!  Also, I sure wish I could be there on Sunday as well to see Pete and the gang's seminars but BPS has got me doing seminars down in their Auburn, New York store on Sunday. So, if anyone's around there, I won't have any free subs but I sure would like to say hi!  Once again, thank you to all the great OFNers that continually support me.  Dave"
166067,Gerritt,2008-02-29 22:17:00,6129,That is awesome news!!!  Ohhhh and Dave... your commercials on Q107 are friggen hilarious!  G
166074,Joey,2008-02-29 22:31:00,9122,"Yes Gerritt, I heard one of the commercials on 102.1 today and laughed my arse off.  The one about some people putting lures in their hats, but Dave recommends they put them on the end of their fishing line, too funny.  Joey"
166109,Dave Mercer,2008-03-01 00:24:00,148,Thanks guys! Glad you like the spots they are on almost every major station around. Stay tuned that is just one of a whole series of commercials that will run over the next few weeks. Hope to see you all tommorow for the free Subway subs after my 2:00pm seminar! YUM
