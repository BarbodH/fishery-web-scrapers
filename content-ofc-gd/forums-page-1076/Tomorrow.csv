Me and the Misses wanted to capitalize on the nice weather and make up for the lack of ice fishing we have had this year(4 times this year vs over 25 last year.)  We were going to head up to Restoule, but we are not sure about the area of the sanctuary and don't want to take the chance.  Is anyone doing anything other then Simcoe or BOQ.  We were thinking of heading a little further North.  Any suggestions (Other then jumping of a bridge) would be great, and some company tomorrow would be an added bonus...  Thanks,  Michael and Michelle"
