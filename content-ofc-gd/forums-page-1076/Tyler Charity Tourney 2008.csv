It was nice to see so many familiar faces again. Always a great time. I had to scoot early, so I missed the festivities on shore.  Unfortunately, the fish didn't co-operate for me, except for about a dozen perch. Strange to see so many perch hauled up from 75-80 ft. depths. I tossed back the first one, thinking it was a fluke. Then came the flurry, including a few double hook sets.   The monsters of the deep.    Big Chev 4x4 & Lady Walleye discussing strategy.    Gerritt hard at work. Double hook set perch for him too. I think he landed a whitefish after I left.    How big was it Shelley?    DouG was trying to convince Percy's relatives to make the ultimate sacrifice for a good cause.    My uncle Rick and cousin Andy made it out to join the fun too.    Sunrise. Looking across the lake from tourney headquarters at Innisfil Park. "
