166260,irishfield,2008-03-01 16:30:00,26272,.. and at least this time it wasn't a three story Cabbagetown building collapsing on me that got me there!  Thanks for the heads up Cory.. and anyone that believes the part about where we were fishing.. well..  http://www.baytoday.ca/content/news/details.asp?c=24510  I'd almost forgot out our Lake's Stewardship contest for a replica mount by advanced.
166262,Sandbag,2008-03-01 16:33:00,533,That's awesome Wayne....  That sure is a beauty Laker.  Good luck with winning the mount  Cheers  Craig
166265,Big Cliff,2008-03-01 16:41:00,6899,"That is fantastic Wayne, good to see that she got released to spawn again and help the fishery. Hope you win the mount!"

166279,tbayboy,2008-03-01 17:43:00,1497,"Thats great Wayne, and you can even see the OFC hat.  Good luck on the draw!"
166281,bramptonjerry,2008-03-01 17:46:00,132,good luck....been a long time since I've heard of a laker that big up there
166284,Clampet,2008-03-01 17:57:00,1947,Good Goin' Irishfield! Would be interestin' if you shared the Cabbagetown incident.
166287,irishfield,2008-03-01 18:17:00,26272," Dats a small one Jerry ! Last year there was a 30lb caught. 2006 a 56lb and 2005 a 43 ! None thru the ice mind you !  Nothing major Clampit... three stories of floors... a 2+ foot thick brick firewall,,, 12 stone fireplaces and me... ALL on the first floor/basement. Thank God there was no roof as well! The wall came straight down like a liquid spreading/pouring out at the bottom..and didn't fall to either side. Was a couple blocks east of the Eaton Centre..can't remember the street, but I opened my eyes to a shattered helmut and a floor joist behind me and in front of me. Good thing I was slim then.. LOL. Historic so had to retain the front wall and modify around it to build condo/townhouse units and they still managed to do that. I was working as a ""cash grunt"" to cover my education late that summer. Just one of a few ""lives"" I've used up over the years."
166294,Muskieman,2008-03-01 18:48:00,2472,"Congrats !!!!  hope ya win the mount.  By the way to you sometimes fish for Pike in Temag  ?  I do,  and actually do pretty good....I lived there for a few years, worked in the seniors complex.  caught a 26.2lb Pike in Ferguson Bay..right by the Island withe the 2 little white cottages on it.  I usually do good there in winter for Lakers.   Here's an example of a Big Temagami Laker.  http://www.temagamifishing.com/44lb-temagami-lake-trout.html"
166302,danbo,2008-03-01 19:22:00,2646,Atta boy!
166304,mepps,2008-03-01 19:34:00,1301,"Nice one, congrats!"
166305,wuchikubo,2008-03-01 19:35:00,1114,"Great Job Wayne, I'm with Roy on this one, I think that mount will be there shortly after the draw."
166307,bucktail,2008-03-01 19:38:00,1857,Awesome fish!
166324,BFSC Kevin,2008-03-01 20:19:00,1351,very cool wayne.
166327,Terry,2008-03-01 20:33:00,14456,that's great and to think we didn't need to photoshop it
166328,Carp,2008-03-01 20:35:00,1488,Excellent job Wayne.  You won't be disappointed if that mount ends up on your wall. The Advanced Taxidermy guys are old school friends of mine and have done many mounts for my friends and family. They are tops in their field.  
166330,John,2008-03-01 20:39:00,2956,"Good job bud! I assume that one didn't come through an 8"" hole? That's a pretty decent fish through the ice, don't want to jinx you, BUT, I'm with everyone else thinking that the replica mount is coming your way!  J..."
166334,irishfield,2008-03-01 20:54:00,26272, It woulda fit.... but glad Terry'd drilled me a 10 !
166337,fishnsled,2008-03-01 21:06:00,3520,"Now I was expecting a profile shot with some numbers under it.  Great news!  Good luck with the contest, the prize couldn't go to a nicer guy.  Well maybe Terry for drilling that 10"" hole.  LOL!"
166340,Moosebunk,2008-03-01 21:10:00,3970,Again superstar Wayne... very nice.
