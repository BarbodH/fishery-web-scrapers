I was hopeing someone would be able to tell me a general area to walk out from for white fish on simcoe. i was hopwing to head out for my first time on simcoe for whitefish and Lakers with my dad and a friend. Also what is recommended line test and what lures would recommend? Thank you so much for helping me out hopefully i get a few. i see many are driving trucks on the ice is it safe for that because if it is we would do that also but walking is much preferred. Thanks everyone.

I was thinking Jackson's point but don't know if I am in good enough shape for the long walk. But if there'd a whitie at the end of the tunnel then maybe I'd make it. Thanks.
