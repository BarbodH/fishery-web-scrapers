166178,Canuck,2008-03-01 03:47:00,491,You guys talking about the Blanche and Round near Kirkland Lake?  I really miss it up there.  My father grew up in Chaput Hughes and I spent most of my summer vacations in that area for about 20 years.  Fished all around there.  Put thousands of miles on the 12ft aluminum car topper on all of the lakes and rivers.  Nice part of the world.  Since my grandmother passed a few years ago I haven't been back.
