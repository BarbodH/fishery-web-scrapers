166016,Roy,2008-02-29 18:18:00,13728,There's no real good reason to lock this thread but I will...I have some knitting to get back to.
163181,Toronto_Angler,2008-02-22 19:37:00,698,"  You don't have control what you catch but you do have control whether to take it out of the water, lip grip and pose for pictures with it."
163182,Terry,2008-02-22 19:42:00,14456,"many people are much quicker  and safer at taking the hook out while holding the fish, and as for taking the picture often I have the camera out and snap the picture before the person who caught the fish even knows that I am going to take one....whether it's in season or not....it's legal so do what you want as long as you don't target them"
163191,Stoty,2008-02-22 20:08:00,2910,"Exactly. You pretty much have to take the fish out of the water to remove the hook. You would do more damage keeping the fish hanging in the hole with the hook in its mouth.  Most fisherman have a camera handy anyways, so while you are holding the fish to remove the hook, your buddy takes a picture. No harm in that.  As long as you weren't deliberately targeting an OOS fish."
163220,glen,2008-02-22 21:00:00,2641,You can't  fish (catch&release only) for Bass when its not bass season ??  Catching a OOS fish is like snagging a fish it doesn't count.  Let it go and i don't need a picture of it either.
163291,Greencoachdog,2008-02-23 00:01:00,8163,"I don't have to worry aboot all or any of that, we don't have any closed seasons on freshwater fish in 'Bama."
163328,Casey123,2008-02-23 01:17:00,461,"  Hey, last time I checked we were not in any state.... This is Canada, we have our own regulations here, not related in anyways to our friends to the South."
165862,ADC,2008-02-29 05:00:00,82,"Boys boys boys,  Im a little shocked at some of the posts. I thought this was a place of cool and non-violent folk.    However, I forgive you.... I understand that you are all grumpy and need some form of action while awaiting the summer months.  Let me clarify the reason for my questions as for some reason I feel the need to defend myself.   I like to fish, I want to fish,  I want to fish as soon as it is warm enough to fish.  I dont have a cottage, I dont have a boat.  The places I have access and know of to fish at are all places that have Bass, Pike, Perch, Rock Bass.  Ive never been ice fishing, I have no idea what kind of fish are legal to ice fish for.  So what I really wanted to know was if it was legal or not to fish catch and release bass out of season. To which I received a clear answer.  ""NO"".  I also wanted to know that if I fish for something IN season and caught a Bass. Would I be screwed. EVEN THOUGH I WAS NOT TARGETING THE BASS  (just to clarify for those with vivid imaginations)   Let me try asking again  What type of  fish I AM LEGALLY ALLOWED to fish for that may inhabit the same waters I currently fish as those are the only places I know of to fish. So if lets say ""Perch"" are in season.... I want to fish for for them if I can.  I just want to fish and do it legally  Remember, before you label me some type of criminal, please make sure you know exactly what is going on before you let me have it.  I came hear for strait answers out of respect so I could follow the rules. I am just asking questions and if you look at my original post... I already had claimed ignorance.  Im just too lazy to go and read this stuff myself and figured it was something to talk about.  "
165929,David Chong,2008-02-29 14:24:00,836,"Bass Marley, if you happen to accidentally catch a bass out of season while legally pursuing another species that is in season then you just release it quickly and you're fine. If you happen upon an area where there are all kinds of spawning bass then you are best to leave because targeting bass out of season is kind of a discretionary call on the CO's part. In other words if you happen to catch one and let it go no problem but if you catch several and stay then a CO may interpret that as targeting bass out of season.  Now if you go to New York, they do have a year long C&R season for bass now! Hope that this clear! Cheers, Dave"
165931,cranks bait,2008-02-29 14:30:00,721,"NO.   If you have time to read this forum, you have time to read the regulations. http://www.mnr.gov.on.ca/MNR/pubs/pubmenu.html#fish or visit almost any place that has fishing stuff and pick up a hard copy.  It is your responibility to know what you can and cannot do."
165937,Terry,2008-02-29 14:46:00,14456,"maybe it's the way you are stating it, but by the way you are stating it you want to know what fish you can legally fish for where you know and want to catch bass that are OOS..with that statement you are saying you know you will be catching bass but you can say you are fishing for perch...that is illegal  and if a CO sees you catch 2 bass in a row without catching a number of perch he will charge you with poaching and almost everyone on this website will be patting the CO on the back for charging you..now maybe we are getting the wrong message from what you are typing but if you knowingly fish for bass  even under the pretence of fishing for a fish that is in season you are breaking the law and as far as I am concerned not welcome here..but like I say maybe we/I am misunderstanding you comments..I hope so"
165962,Golfisher,2008-02-29 16:42:00,586," You just answered your question there:  whatever species that's in season.  Just make sure that your tackle and approach are appropriate for the fish you are targeting--throwing a buzzbait to catch a perch would not be looked upon kindly.  Also, if you end up hooking more bass than the fish you are targeting, then you are just out of luck: move to another location."
165985,Bernie,2008-02-29 17:32:00,3190,I see guys targeting bass from May 24 weekend until bass season all the time. When I see them casting in towards my dock with a topwater they catch hell from me. They mouth back and say there is nothing illegal what they are doing. Hmmmm? Gets me some hot under the collar but I tend to leave it at that point. Not much for heated arguments.
165987,Stoty,2008-02-29 17:35:00,2910, Nothing solves that problem like a paintball gun!
165990,Bernie,2008-02-29 17:38:00,3190,Or maybe take the kids waterskiing.    Just to cool my temper.
165991,Stoty,2008-02-29 17:39:00,2910,"Guarantee they wont fish your dock again, when they see 200 paintballs coming their way at about 300 pfs!  hahaha"
165993,Casey123,2008-02-29 17:41:00,461,"I gave up yelling at people long time ago, I find waving a gun arond has pretty much the same effect."
165994,Stoty,2008-02-29 17:44:00,2910,"hahaha, no doubt!  But then you're not getting target practice in at the same time!"
165998,Gerritt,2008-02-29 17:49:00,6129,and that is the end of this thread......
165999,addy79,2008-02-29 17:51:00,573,"sorry gerritt, lose a friend to someone with that mentality and see if it doesnt rub you the same way..."
166000,Stoty,2008-02-29 17:54:00,2910,"waving it and using it are two different things. his reply was in a joking matter.  sorry for you're loss, but that type of reaction wasn't necessary."
166005,Stoty,2008-02-29 18:00:00,2910,"Joking about waiving a gun around isn't a personal attack on a board member.  Roy, I say lock this before it gets ugly.  Apparently some people dont understand the concept of a joke."
166007,Terry,2008-02-29 18:01:00,14456,"yeah, I took the gun comment as a joke but a camera taking their picture and the boats picture goes a long way..."
166012,addy79,2008-02-29 18:11:00,573,"i digress...lock it if you want, i've said my piece. i can take a joke as much as the next guy, but see little humor in gun violence."
166013,Stoty,2008-02-29 18:16:00,2910,"Cheer up, its Friday!"
166015,addy79,2008-02-29 18:17:00,573,true enough... and spring is just around the corner! cant wait to NAIL those protective male bucketmouthes!! just playin...
162841,ADC,2008-02-21 20:25:00,82,This may be an ignorant question but I figure this is the best place for a good answer.  Can u still fish (catch&release only) for Bass when its not bass season ??  I know you cant keep any but is catch and release out of bass season legal ??   any insight would be greatly appreciated.   
162843,Whopper,2008-02-21 20:26:00,2174,No you can not target out of season fish period.  Unless your fishing Lake Erie during the closed Smallmouth bass season in the State of Ohio which makes no sense to me
162844,huntervasili,2008-02-21 20:27:00,1604,It is illegal to target any species out of season.
162845,Tinman,2008-02-21 20:27:00,376,Thats a big NO
162849,ADC,2008-02-21 20:32:00,82,are there any fish that are in season all year round?  and are there any fish in season right now that would be found around the same places bass would normally be in the summer?   thnx
162851,Tinman,2008-02-21 20:36:00,376,your best bet is to pick up a regulations guide as it is different fish are open at different times in different areas.
162852,shane,2008-02-21 20:39:00,652,Carp are in season year round.   But only for the truly hard-core.
162853,Rich Clemens,2008-02-21 20:40:00,3131,"That be a BIG  ""NO NO"" and quite costly if anyone would be caught."
162885,douG,2008-02-21 22:21:00,2693,  I think you are still a little unclear on the concept.
162894,bassjnkie,2008-02-21 22:41:00,1101," Funny you post this question. I have an ex friend that goes for pike (he says) in shallows, with a spinnerbait, cranks, all the lures that ""would"" catch pike. As he is targeting pike(ya!), he hammers the OOS Bass. But he is targeting PIKE. He has been stopped many times and he tells the CO he is going for PIKE and gets off.  Please answer this one.  Like I said EX FRIEND.  Daniel OCH"
162918,GbayGiant,2008-02-21 23:50:00,1780,"I catch bass everyday out of season unitentionally in the spring fishing walleye, pike ect... simply because they are everywhere and eat any bait all day, but the reason they have these periods is to let the fish spawn in peace with no stress so it is very important not to target them. All you can do really is make sure to keep the fish in the water and release it quick as possible, honestly I don't even target bass hardly at all, all year, but I bet I catch more bass then all other species put together, they are usually a nuisance to me, they are fun to catch but when your looking for something else and they steal your bait all day it gets annoying. Bass are doing very well on Gbay I would say almost too well.  But try other species in other spots, don't go to your secret bass hole and pretend to target something else, for me the bass happen to be everywhere the walleye and pike are and theres nothing you can do about it."
162953,kentooley,2008-02-22 01:37:00,208,"I think I read somewhere that the reason you can't target oos bass is because male bass guard their nests and even if you practice c&r, any time spent fighting these fish leaves the nest unguarded and the eggs vulnerable to predation from smaller species."
163000,Rich,2008-02-22 03:33:00,3927,Is this question for real?
163008,bassman,2008-02-22 03:57:00,384,  It a legit question. There are regs in certain states that allow you to C&R out of season fish.
163017,snag,2008-02-22 04:22:00,1932,Have you been fishing with Bonghitts yet?    
163024,Ben_Daniels,2008-02-22 04:56:00,435,HAHAHAHA!!!
163026,charlied,2008-02-22 04:59:00,584,"I tried telling that to some guy here in Fort Erie...he didn't want any of my advise....told me he was just catch and releasing them and said that it was alright....told him NO of course.  Guess I lost the battle of the stupid on this one...LOL  Trout are year around in Lake ontario, lake erie and Niagara river."
163031,OhioFisherman,2008-02-22 09:07:00,6623,""" No you can not target out of season fish period.  Unless your fishing Lake Erie during the closed Smallmouth bass season in the State of Ohio which makes no sense to me ""  Well said Phil! If you truly care about the sport and maintaining a first class fishery why would you want too?  One of my major complaints about the pro bass tour, they seem to think fishing for bedding bass is a good plan. Nice to see big fish at a weigh in, but at the cost of those fish with a failed spawn?"
163047,brickNblock,2008-02-22 12:27:00,598, Right on douG...... Please do the RIGHT THING buddy......These are our waters as well.
163049,Whopper,2008-02-22 12:36:00,2174,  Go get em tiger!
163083,LeXXington,2008-02-22 14:23:00,1928,"No! and always check your regs.  Think of it this way. Do you stop at stop sign's when no one is there??  Yes cause its the law, targeting OOS fish is a no, no"
163087,Terry,2008-02-22 14:33:00,14456,"but is there somewhere I can do it that no one will see.....  I mean if a tree falls in the forest and there is no one to hear it, does it still get protesters complaining about logging companies......                 yeah I was kidding"
163093,Toronto_Angler,2008-02-22 14:45:00,698,I agree that oos fishing is wrong. I find it funny though that everyone is complaining about it yet when someone poses with the OOS bass they catch while ice fishing they get complimented.
163174,snag,2008-02-22 19:00:00,1932,"  Yeah, I love that.  And when it's an OOS Musky, the ""pros"" LOSE IT!     BTW Bass Marley,  Good for you to have the interest and guts to ask your question. "
163176,Stoty,2008-02-22 19:08:00,2910," True, which is funny.  But in all fairness, when your ice fishing your using the same technique, and aren't moving. So, you have hardly any control as to what you catch.  Its a different story when you see someone out there in May using topwater baits, in back bays.....those are the guys that I want to smack with a paddle up-side-the-head!"
