166146,Markystang,2008-03-01 02:47:00,131,"Personally, I use Fireline Crystal on my spinning rods and PowerPro on my baitcasters. I'll use a bit of mono or flouro leader in clearwater/finesse situations. I use masking tape or electrical tape or some mono to back the braid and have never had slip problems. 2 of my friends who have not backed their braid have had bad slippage, costing them fish on the hookset."
166151,Sinker,2008-03-01 02:56:00,8692,I've had braid slip too.......I always put a few wraps of mono on just so that never happens again. The tape trick would prolly work just as well.  Sinker
166213,Garry2Rs,2008-03-01 08:26:00,1425,"Like you I enjoyed using Stealth, and looked forward to Ultracast Invisabraid. I ordered a 300 yard spool of 30 pound test, and I am very disappointed! Invisabraid is similar to Fireline Cryistal, in that it looks like plain white butcher string.  It is not a tight weave like Powerpro. My spool may be defective, but I have had numerous break offs... The line breaks in mid-air 20 or 30 feet away from the reel!!??? The line is also sticky...I find light lures hard to cast because the line sticks to the spool and foals the cast. This is the line, not me or the rod/reel...I can cure the problem by switching to Powerpro or Fireline. It might be okay on a spinning reel, but I wouldn't advise anyone to buy it for a baitcaster.  In fact I wouldn't suggest that anyone buy it at all!!! I will put the balance of my 300 yards on a spincast reel for the kid next door. Garry2rs"
166215,Marc Thorpe,2008-03-01 09:56:00,621,"Bill on my muskie baitcaster I use Dacron 63 pound test as backing,only do a couple wraps to cover the bottom of the spool. As Irish pointed out,first year I use as is,the second year I reverse it onto another reel.You get 2 years this way. Unless I chop it all away during the season from re-tying I've used invisibraid but 80 pound,have not had any issues with it,I still like the stealth line  You can spool direct,the prob with slippage is not emptying your reel and reeling in line before using for the first time upon getting on the water"
166293,BillM,2008-03-01 18:40:00,17367,Appreciate the help Marc.  I'll make sure to empty out the spool and re-spool while on the water.   Is it June yet?
166300,Crazyhook,2008-03-01 19:16:00,1154,I love the stealth as well... I did try Sufix braid and really loved it. I will be respooling in a few weeks and have to figure out what I am going to do.
166308,mepps,2008-03-01 19:39:00,1301,"I agree with Weeds - braid is easier for me to untangle.  On these deep tangles, I usually just pull as hard as i possible can and 9 out of 10 times it slips out.  Mono gets all stretched and breaks easily if you really pull on it.  I started using Seagar Fluro a couple years ago for pike and musky leaders and its been great.  Its fairly pricey, but I 25 yard spool has lasted more then 2 seasons and a lot of pike fishing!  When I spool braid, I take that white sticker thats attached t the  end of the line and put it on my reel spool.  Even half the sticker will prevent slippage.  A small piece of hockey tape would work too."
166344,irishfield,2008-03-01 21:14:00,26272, Just be sure to do like Marc does and get someone else to reel that 4 ounce bucktail back in at 5MPH...all 350 yards of it !
166354,BillM,2008-03-01 21:41:00,17367," I am sure if I ask my oldman to, he'd promptly tell me to go (insert expletive  here) myself"
166370,Corey,2008-03-01 22:33:00,355,I must be old school... I use trilene on all my reels.
165819,OhioFisherman,2008-02-29 03:14:00,6623,"A buddy and me were trolling on the Georgian bay years ago, he was using an over sized spinning reel spooled with 40 pound mono on what looked like a ocean boat rod, like 6 foot long and the action of a broom handle. Dang thing had to weigh a ton! He hooked what had to be a Muskie that busted him off, drag a bit too tight.  Dude was 6' 5"" 270 and could bench 535, outfit might have been ok for him, but not most humans. 40 pound mono looks like rope, kind of handles the same on a reel, 65 pound Power Pro is the same diameter as 16 pound mono, just easier to deal with, and a heavy fluorocarbon leader takes the place of a steel one, less visible.  Not much experience with braids myself, I tried the original Spider Wire and didn`t like it. Bought some Power Pro, 65#, easier to deal with, but not much actual fishing time with it. Few casts around the yard a few at a lake.  I use 10 to 20 pound test mono most of the time, no trouble feeling a tiny nick, and I am not shy about retying or re spooling. Sucks to lose a fish cause you got lazy or in a hurry.  The plan was to re-try muskie fishing with a little more focus on actually landing them, power pro seemed like a better plan than those in the past."
165827,BillM,2008-02-29 03:29:00,17367," Hell, it could be me  I had to cut out the last 2 backlashes I got with braid (20lb) while up at the French last year.  I am going to be running 50 or 65lb Spiderwire Stealth this year on my muskie setup, we'll see how that turns out"
165830,irishfield,2008-02-29 03:34:00,26272,"65 Steath wraps cleaner/evener than PPro. It's also limper than PPro. I've got PPro on all my muskie gear except my new trolling reel. If I had of fished with Thorpe before I bought that 1500 yard spool of PPro 80 they'd all have Stealth on them. I bought the 700B after fishing with Thorpe and loaded it with 65 Stealth. If it works for Marc 7 days a week at 6 MPH and 50"" + fish... it'll work for me."
165869,waterwolf,2008-02-29 05:27:00,556,"braid for me has been a godsend .bought my first baitcaster last year [ a decent model] and had a couple of birds -nests , fewer than expected, but had fewer cutouts than i'd thought . icefishing ,,same deal ,rock hook-sets in deeper water ,no stretch. 30lb wipes out worry of breakage in most app'sand is very manageable.20lb with a flouro leader is undetectable and casts like a bullet the new braid ,,,,is the new black."
165881,Marc Thorpe,2008-02-29 10:52:00,621,"Big trick with most lines ,once you have spooled your reel up with fresh line is to un-spool and re-reel it all back in When you hit the water with it for the first time ,un-spool it all and reel it back in,it spools back on tight plus the fact it gets wet when it dries it tighten everything up real nice All reels ,baitcast or open face"
165907,cranks bait,2008-02-29 13:39:00,721,"I fish very clear water on the St. Lawrence and up near Bancroft.  I use Power Pro 50 on my baitcaster (had a few birdsnest becasue I'm a rookie, but never had to cut it out.)  On my spinning rods I use PP 20.  I do not use a Floro leader and only use a Ti leader when targeting pike.  I've never had a problem catching fish.  But also like mentioned earlier, I also don't make any money fishing"
165920,snag,2008-02-29 14:03:00,1932," $3, what can I say, I shop around  I always use an 80# leader with my 30# braid for pike.  Bass can be any line for me but braid is always my first choice in case a suprise toothy critter, weeds, logs etc. are in the area.  Braid saves money and time 1. lasts longer 2. less line breakage, therefore: 3. less lures lost 4. more hook-ups 5. less re-spooling downtime.  Birdsnests with braid, I have learned the pattern of birdsnests with a baitcaster so that 99% of the time I can reverse engineer the nest in a minute and get back to casting.  cheers!"
165921,David Chong,2008-02-29 14:04:00,836,"It depends also on what presentation that you are using whether you should have a fluoro-carbon leader or not. Slower finesse presentation in gin-clear water is definitely a situation for it. As for the Fireline, it is more sensitive, thinner, better on hook sets and cast further. You also shouldn't be filling up your whole spool with Fireline, put a mono backing on and then about 50-75 yds. of Fireline. It also last longer than mono, it doesn't deteriorate as quickly. Fluoro-carbon is also super tough as a leader, it is very abbrasion-resistant. For all you Stealth lovers out there, you have the SpiderWire UltraCast. I started using it last year and I was blown away by how much better it was than Stealth. And I love the Stealth, mind you the Ultracast is more expensive. I'm looking forward to trying the Invisa-Braid in the Ultra-Cast this year. Cheers, Dave"
165934,BillM,2008-02-29 14:36:00,17367,"Irish/Marc,  Do you guys use a mono backing?  I've read on many sites that most people run some mono backing just to cover up the spool, then switch over to braid.  Also, what type of leaders should a newbie be looking at?  I'm probably not up to making my own flouro leaders yet, but anything good I can pick up at Bass Pro or perhaps via the Internet?  -Bill"
165941,irishfield,2008-02-29 14:54:00,26272,"I don't. Why be putting something that deteriorates under something that will last for a few, or more, seasons. It (line) ain't that expensive in the overall picture of things...especially Muskie. Most say they put mono on as backing so the braid won't slip... I think it's a cost issue for them instead. Spool knot and 6"" of electrical tape is what I learned, right here on OFC, or the spool lug if equipped...just don't get spooled !  I do all my lake trout/walleye trolling stuff the same way. Full reel of 30 lb PPro and do so by watching ebay close and grabbing 1500yrd spools of line.  2 or 3 years down the road... reel the line off one reel and onto another reverersing it's direction. How much does the line now cost compared to Mono changed every year... it's cheaper!"
165944,cranks bait,2008-02-29 15:02:00,721,I do that same thing as Irishfield and have never had a problem with my line spinning on the reel.  Another trick I learned was to respool your line from one reel to another after a years use.  This allows you to get the most out of your line as the back half generally doesn't get used as much.
165947,BillM,2008-02-29 15:14:00,17367,See these are the little tips I'd never know unless I asked    Thanks guys!
166053,Fishnwire,2008-02-29 20:57:00,983,"That re-spooling from one rod to another is a good idea!  I'm gonna do that.  I think I may also try adding a fluor leader to my more finesse presentations too.  What brand should I look for?  Also, I've only used spiderwire and fireline.  (I liked fireline better than spiderwire)  I notice a lot of guys are using PowerPro...how does that compare to fireline?"
