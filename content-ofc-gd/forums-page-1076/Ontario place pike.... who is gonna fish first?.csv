164961,highdrifter,2008-02-27 06:54:00,2534," S'up ya'll.  Rick, you should make a break from the island for a weekend.   The harbour feels so horribly underfished since the segregation of the mctrio.  Come on down son!!  cheers H to the D"
164962,highdrifter,2008-02-27 06:56:00,2534, yyeeeee oooh man I'm jonzin.  How does Sunday sounds to anyone?
165032,BITEME,2008-02-27 13:57:00,1969, IM IN  TIME AND PLACE
165035,BillM,2008-02-27 14:03:00,17367,I'll most likely be fishing after work during the week if anything.
165154,BFSC Kevin,2008-02-27 18:21:00,1351,i might be down for sunday. but is it too early? i still need to pick up some stuff!!! can't wait for the spring classic!
165443,Toronto_Angler,2008-02-28 03:49:00,698,What are your favorite tactics for spring Pike? I'm going to be using Smelts either fished on the bottom or under a float. I heard that works well. Also heard Rapala Countdowns are pretty good for cold water.
165488,BillM,2008-02-28 13:21:00,17367,"I was talking to Grant yesterday at Bass Pro, he suggested suspended huskie jerks should be a good idea.  Monday looks like some decent weather, I think I might head down to Ontario Place after work..."
165528,dunder,2008-02-28 15:19:00,14," Hi  I'm curious? Can you tell me what ""snot rockets"" are?  Thanks in advance"

165532,gekhunter,2008-02-28 15:28:00,61,Has anyone seen the conditions up closeâ€¦.I'm looking over the harbour from downtown and looks pretty frozen out there except for a path for the ferry.
165535,Toronto_Angler,2008-02-28 15:35:00,698,  The latest cold snap froze up most spots pretty good. Some Marina's have warm water pumps near the boat launches which might be open. But with this cold weather not sure how active the pike will be.
165545,BFSC Kevin,2008-02-28 16:13:00,1351,yeah.. i think im gonig to wait for atleast another week before i head out.. just a tad too cold..
166028,tdotfisherman,2008-02-29 19:12:00,317,"  You can say that again.. I was just out at a local spot, fishing the big Lake O.. The winds were howling, the waves were pounding, and the snow was blowing.. but it was still an absolute blast because I was wetting a line for the first time in over a month! Nothing even close to a bite, but I dont care, it was still great.."
166032,Stoty,2008-02-29 19:20:00,2910,"I have never fished anywhere near the city before, so I would like to give it a try! Someone post the date/time when a few of you will be going, and I will try and join ya!  Cheers, *Stoty"
166043,PatrickGG,2008-02-29 19:58:00,562,"OMG! ROFLCOPTER!, I will hit all those good spots before you guys i just hope none of you SNAG"""" any bikes, i did my routine drive and found a couple of open spots i am just gonna wait and sneak up on them toothy critters.  P.S Lets not forget the 3k walk."
166144,waterwolf,2008-03-01 02:42:00,556,"it was nasty out there when i drove by in the mornin' i'll be waiting a week for sure there's still alot of ice ,, you'd be limited in where you could throw for 'em. what's involved in getting a harbor permit when i do get primed to hit the lake?? anyone have an idea?"
166147,Ben_Daniels,2008-03-01 02:48:00,435,"I'm definitely ready for some TO Pike Action!!! I think its gonna be a while though...I was at one of my local spots, a small bay,  trying for some Brown Trout earlier this week. I ended up walking a good KM or two before I even got to open water. I was going to fish this bay but ended up fishing wide open Lake O because everything else was frozen over  .  Someone mentioned goin out in float tubes....I got one this winter and I'm yet to use it. Id be down for some float tube Pikin!!!  -Ben"
166168,FishHeadRic,2008-03-01 03:29:00,226,"        Ahh, Waiting for the ice-out. The one thing I don't miss    Remember this day Fidel?  FHR"

166181,ranger520vx,2008-03-01 03:52:00,164,  nice job FHR. that is pure hardcore fishing.
166188,Ben_Daniels,2008-03-01 04:07:00,435,"Holy Crap FHR! with the ice right next to you...your Hardcore! I still don't have waders, I'm headin up to BPS this week though, cant wait till the ice is out!  -Ben"
166197,FishHeadRic,2008-03-01 04:35:00,226,Yeah a little nuts.  Great fishing though. I used to go out on Christmas day under OP It's a great area cause it's fairly protected from the wind but your could only spend half and hour at a time in the water otherwise you'd just start cramping up.  It also got dangerous going between the ice sheets. I'd sit there and wait till they parted and gun it to the other side. I did have them close on me one time and had to hop up on top of the ice sheet before my legs got pinched off.  I also used to love the way people would look at me when I got on the TTC covered in Pike blood and smelling like a China town supermarket floor. Hehe!   FHR
166212,young_one,2008-03-01 07:45:00,620," LOL, that might happen to me one day"
164664,gforce,2008-02-26 17:31:00,63,Anyone starting to itch to do some fishing at Ontario Place?  Any target dates?
164666,BillM,2008-02-26 17:36:00,17367,"I've never fished there, but if anyone needs some company let me know!!!  (I work 401/Dixie not to far away)"
164668,tdotfisherman,2008-02-26 17:41:00,317,"I'm itchin' to do some GTA pike fishing, but not really at Ontario Place, it's a tad out of the way.. I can't stew indoors for much longer though.. I'm really starting to go through withdrawls.. my unofficial target date for some local pike is probably going to be for next Monday because I have the day off, and the forcast calls for +2 with sun/cloud mix, so lets hope I can get out to a few local spots.."
164671,BFSC Kevin,2008-02-26 17:47:00,1351,"im itching to go.. but ontario place is a tad west of me... we'll see! well if anyone goes, send me a PM"
164675,Oktravis,2008-02-26 17:57:00,62,ill be out as soon as the ice is gone and there is an hour of light after 6:00 when i get off work.i cant wait.
164686,ranger520vx,2008-02-26 18:13:00,164,"By March 10th I would hope, itching to get out again for sure in the boat.  For anyone more interested in learning more about the great fishery around Toronto Harbour, visit my new Facebook site.  link"
164697,tdotfisherman,2008-02-26 18:36:00,317,"I don't have facebook, but am interested in attempting to fish the islands more than the 1 time I did last year.."
164701,cranks bait,2008-02-26 18:41:00,721,"I'm confused.  I checked the regs. and could not find where pike is open?  I do not know exactly where the harbour is, but it looks like pike does not open till May.  What am I missing?  How do I get into the action?"
164713,Toronto_Angler,2008-02-26 19:39:00,698,I'm also looking to do some Pike fishing. Probably second weekend of March. Usually hit Bluffers or Harbour. Anyone is interested let me know. Maybe we should do an OFC GTG for Urban Pike fishing. lol
164725,ranger520vx,2008-02-26 20:26:00,164,Page 93 of the regs.......regs zone 20   Open Jan 1st-March31st & 1st Saturday  in May-Dec31st. Its zone 20 and the regs are simpler then ever to understand.  Used to be year round open season.
164729,cranks bait,2008-02-26 20:34:00,721,ooops my bad.  I misread it for March 1st wondering why everyone was heading out next week.  I'm guessing the ice has just (or will be soon) left and it is time to get some soft water in before it shuts down.
164730,mepps,2008-02-26 20:34:00,1301,I SO wish I was in Ontario - GTA pike fishing is top notch.  Dont forget your spinner baits and xraps gentlemen!
164731,BillM,2008-02-26 20:35:00,17367,Can anyone drop some hints as to where I can wet a line from shore?  I don't think I'll be dragging the boat down to work anytime soon.
164735,highdrifter,2008-02-26 20:49:00,2534,"Hey let's set a date.  We could even have an OFC meet and greet!!  Does anyone here have a float tube and good neoprene waders??   Harbour security are starting to crack down on people fishing from shore, especially at Ontario Place.  I usually tell those glorified night watchmen to gimme a wide berth, as I've never had problems with the police, who are responsible for patrolling the area I'm told.  They're such a pain in the arse!  Still, the bite should pick up very soon!!  cheers HD"
164740,snag,2008-02-26 21:10:00,1932,April is the best time to go             Not

164751,capt bruce,2008-02-26 21:44:00,820,"been a few of us (5-6 regulars and more on some days ) going at it at lunch time all winter from the foot of spadina towards ontario place. I work just up the street and spend my lunch hour casting to any open water I find . Its a hit and miss thing but you manage a fish or two every few days ( had a few browns two weeks ago but mostly snot rockets , hopefully the big guys will show up soon) keeps me going (better than the walk up the street to  hootters) hope to see you guys down there ."
164757,BillM,2008-02-26 22:03:00,17367,"I'm done at 4pm Monday-Friday and just want to wet a line, I couldn't care what I catch (or don't catch).  Just getting the baitcaster back in my hands will be good enough!!!  If anyone wants to meet up, just tell me where and when"
164777,cthewrld,2008-02-26 23:05:00,99,"I would be happy to join up with anyone for some fishing.  I am on LTD at the moment, so am available anytime.  It is definitely time!"
164807,FishHeadRic,2008-02-27 00:02:00,226,"The season always closed in April in lake O. Geeze, I wish I was back there at this time of year! Guys, the pike are out there all winter! Some of my best days were in Late Feb, and all through march. Just look for open water! I used to fish between the cracks of ice! I don't want to burn spots for the guys that are doing the leg work so I won't openly. If some of you guys want though PM me and I'll point you in the right direction. S'up Fidel, Grant!  FHR"

164960,discophish,2008-02-27 06:48:00,392,"If you guys get together, let me know.  I live in the core of downtown Toronto.  Would be neat to catch some fish less than 5 minutes down the road.  I have a boat, but don't have a harbour license.  Hooters ... hmmm, now that's a toss up."
