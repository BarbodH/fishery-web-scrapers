166029,OhioFisherman,2008-02-29 19:14:00,6623,"I have never tried it. I make a lot of my own jig heads but soft plastics are for the most part pretty cheap. A flea market a mile from the house that sells closeouts, discontinued items from wal-mart and such for 50 cents to a buck a package. A couple pre-spring fishing shows with similar pricing on name brands.  I have also bought directly from the manufacturer 100 quantities usually warrants some kind of deal."
166035,cthewrld,2008-02-29 19:30:00,99,"I wish I could find something like that around here.  We buy a package of Senko's for anywhere from $6.50 to $10.00.  I pour my own for around a buck.  I can also make whatever colour I want, whenever I need them.  It takes about 30 minutes to make around a dozen.  Keeps me entertained ......."
166044,OhioFisherman,2008-02-29 19:58:00,6623,"I guess one of the advantages of living here, cheap tackle.  http://www.ohiogamefishing.com/community/s...ead.php?t=85592   http://www.ohiogamefishing.com/community/s...4500&page=2   http://blog.cleveland.com/sports/2008/02/f...around_the.html  Lots to see and do if you get around ok."
166051,Whopper,2008-02-29 20:48:00,2174,Nobody here wants to tote OhioFisherman's jig & plastic box around  Trust me on this one right Paul!
166060,OhioFisherman,2008-02-29 21:44:00,6623,"LOL Phil, that was the boat bag, the reason I liked fishing out of my own, didn`t have to carry it! My boat was slow to plane though, should have had it in back? Just easier to carry stuff than decide to try something you don`t have with you.  You guys had breakfast you needed to work it off!"
166122,JEREMY,2008-03-01 01:08:00,300,"I was thinking about trying to make my own this summer,so i did a little search and came up with this site.         www.tacklemaking.com.It shows you how to make your own molds.Hope this helps."
166253,cthewrld,2008-03-01 15:23:00,99,I actually bought some stuff in order to try it out.  I'm pretty pleased with the results.  I have been making Senko style worms in various colours.  Let me know if you would be willing to try some out for me.
166261,cranks bait,2008-03-01 16:30:00,721,When I can buy a bag of 100 Salty Cincos (made in Canada) for $40.00 I don't think much about making my own.  I'd rather be on the water
