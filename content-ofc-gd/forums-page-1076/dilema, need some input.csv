Heavily pressured? yes, limited numbers of quality fish? yes.  I also was a tournament guy here in Ohio, for bass. Some lakes you need to spend more time on to get an idea of what approach to take locating the fish and what methods work best to catch them.  Took me 3 trips to Lake Chautaqua in New York before I caught a bass, first two trips all I could hook were Muskies. I did learn the first two trips where not to fish! For me a different game plan for fun fishing, I want to go to lakes I have had success on.  I have had lakes where I look like a bass master on practice days, like a bum on the tournament day. Situations changes, the faster and better you adapt to them the better of you are.  LOL a pattern is only a pattern if your catching fish on it."

166475,irishfield,2008-03-02 03:47:00,26272,Not only the 350 that likes it's juice Dan !
166488,waterwolf,2008-03-02 04:59:00,556,"i'll slow it down a bit for you . hope to catch a couple of fish to warrant the extra attention the wife would appreciate for my absense on sunday {our quality-time day. the 350 [being my truck }likes  her gas so without someone to share the costs , it's becomes somewhat expensive . thanks anyway guys."
