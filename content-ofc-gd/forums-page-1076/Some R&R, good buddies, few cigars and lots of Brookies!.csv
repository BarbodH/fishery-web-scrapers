Anyhow, our objective was to get away for a couple of days, FISH, tell ""stories"" true or false, FISH, smoke a few cigars, FISH, eat like Kings, FISH, have a lot of beverages and FISH!!  We caught over 80 trout, and it was just the perfect trip!! Not a lot of pics due to my forgeting to bring spare camera batteries up with me!!!!  The first trout of the day for my good ole buddy ""Billy Jack""    The fish cleaning station     Me and ""Butch"" with a few more trout lying on the ice beside him...    BREAKFAST!!!!    LUNCH!!  "
