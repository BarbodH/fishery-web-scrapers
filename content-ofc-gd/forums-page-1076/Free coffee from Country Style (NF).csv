165735,pikehunter,2008-02-29 00:10:00,1659,"WOW! Country Style could potentially give away a whole lot of coffee with that deal. It is a good advertising gimmick if just for the publicity this promo could generate. It will be tough for them to sway those die hard lovers of Hortons coffee.  Me, I'm not  particularly fond of Horton's beverage and would rather drink the competitions. But as usual Hortons has all the good locations wrapped up leaving little choice so. . ."
165760,shane,2008-02-29 00:52:00,652,"Good for them.  I'm not a big fan of Tim Horton's either..., for numerous reasons.  But like pikehunter said, they're everywhere.  Now I just need to find a 'Country Style'."
165850,Hooked,2008-02-29 04:13:00,891,"I actually prefer Country Style over Tim Hortons.  I do pass by a Country Style on my way home from work to boot.  And I can come up with several Tim Horton cups/day between me and my buds at work.  Looks like I'll be making several trips to CS, plus they have the best Danishes!  Thanks for the heads up!"

165951,Marko,2008-02-29 15:45:00,854,I think you are allowed to have only 1 free coffee a day per customer. So I am not sure if you can go in with a bag of empties from timmies and ask for free coffies at country style
