I hosed it down to melt the ice and to make sure that the outside was free of dirt.  However, whenever I turn it on it almost immediately begins to ice up again.  Is this a sign that it is low on coolent?  What is the price range of adding coolent and fixing a leak?  What is the price range of a new air conditioner for a ~2,000 sq' home?  My current unit came new with the house which was built in 2003.  I would appreciate any advice you can offer."

707966,tb4me,2012-06-21 13:57:00,3295,Im sorry.. is the unit outside freezing up or the condenser in the furnace itself? Either way call your local service guy. Thats not somthing you can fix yourself..

Call a certified technician, the system has to be leak tested and recharged, Make sure the technician attach an ODP sticker when finished, that basically means that there are no more leaks in the system at the time he leaves. It is illegal to charge a system with refrigerat without repairing and leak testing it,"

708171,John Bacon,2012-06-21 23:40:00,3277,Thanks for your replies.  It is the outside unit that is icing up.  Can that be caused by a clogged furnace filter as well?  If the filter doesn't work I will have the coolent checked.
708666,John Bacon,2012-06-24 12:55:00,3277,Thanks for all the replies. It looks like problem was caused by the filter in the furnace. I haven't had an issue since replacing the filter.
