When I don't work I use all my time to fishing but I think that this hobby is more beatiful when you can share it with someone!!!!If someone want fishing with me I'll be happy!!! I love fly fishing and spinning and the next week I'll have also my first belly boat!!! I'm also a rod builder and I have here some of my ""babies"". Have a great fishing day!!!! Riccardo"
