707647,Locnar,2012-06-20 16:37:00,645,"My buddy and I are plannin' on hitting up either Canal or Mitchell lake for some invasive pikes. I've heard they're pike factories, is this true? Any tips for lures or certain kinds of structure to look for? Is one lake better than the other? I'll be sure to write up a report on how it went, being that we hook into some of those toothy my mom hates me. Anyhow, any kind of advice is much appreciated."
707651,Cosmos,2012-06-20 16:47:00,588, I was on the Mitchell last Sunday. Water level is low. It's hard to navigate - you have to clean up your prop every minute because of the weeds. Fishing was slow. Didn't fish Canal Lake this year.
707905,baironhorse,2012-06-21 11:05:00,145,Mitchell buy far if want some solid pike action.....east of bridge is excellent also on west of bridge north end is great too....also there are tiger's in there too!
707907,baironhorse,2012-06-21 11:06:00,145,All u need is a good trolling motor!! Full battery and ur set!!!
707919,Rizzo,2012-06-21 11:56:00,4754,"personally I would go Mitchell. Lots of pike and you might get a musky or 2 as well. I've never caught a musky in Canal (having said that, I've only fished it a couple of times and was after pike)"
707936,Locnar,2012-06-21 12:42:00,645,"Right on, Mitchell it is then. Yeah, all we have is a small flatbottom boat with trolling motor. When you say east of the bridge, do you mean the southern section of the lake?"
707959,richyb,2012-06-21 13:39:00,774,Good call on mitchel. My grandparents live on canal and they say the fishing sucks this year. There are a few big musky in there tho.
707961,16 Footer,2012-06-21 13:47:00,191,Where is the public access to Mitchell Lake?
708130,Locnar,2012-06-21 22:15:00,645,"AHAHAHAHAH, I didn't notice until now... I wrote toothy Bas tards , but it replaced it with ""my mom hates me""  That is awesome."
708132,addy79,2012-06-21 22:22:00,573,Lmao!! I was wondering what u were saying there. Awesome
708138,funfishing,2012-06-21 22:40:00,147," Make a left off the County Road 48 bridge if you're heading eastward, it's a right if you're heading westward."
708147,mirogak,2012-06-21 22:56:00,387,"If it was me, I would go to Balsam provincial park, launch the boat there, and fish my way into Mitchell from Balsam.  Food for thought."
708149,Locnar,2012-06-21 22:58:00,645, We have a small flat bottom boat propelled by a trolling motor. About the speed of paddling a canoe.
708266,baironhorse,2012-06-22 11:28:00,145,"Launch boat off 48 just before Shallamar if u passed gas station went to far....ur rig is perfect for that lake.... Go under bridge eastward and u will see a field of weeds hit the lines u will hit.... I have seen tiger musky come out of there and they r ffffkin nice!!!...also when u lauch troll around island and on ur right there r stumps....experment u will catch....my buddy uses a 12"" flat botton with a cooler live will set up and a 30lb trust tm and he catches a ton...dont need a big boat on this lake!"
708267,baironhorse,2012-06-22 11:30:00,145,He better have a couple of batteries then if u plan to launch thru balsam!!!! 
708271,Locnar,2012-06-22 12:23:00,645," Oh no, I'm not launching from balsam... probably take us all day to get to Mitchell haha."
