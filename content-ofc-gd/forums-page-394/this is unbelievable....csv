707530,iFish4real,2012-06-20 11:32:00,386,"it's not like it can really affect us in any way but it's really annoying seeing what our gov. is doing for a few bucks  ....is like hiring an American corporation to operate Canadian Utilities like Water Supply Plants ...in other words, let's help the ""poor"" Americans make an honest buck"
707534,DaveMc,2012-06-20 11:56:00,89,"From what i have been told (and i made sure to ask when i found out AO was a US company) is that they are one of 3 companies in North America with this hardware. All 3 are US based, and AO has their equipment in 30 states. Again, when i called in and asked this is the answer i received."
707550,BillM,2012-06-20 12:26:00,17367," If they kept it here and passed on their 'savings' to us, people would be complaining about the higher prices."
707571,cram,2012-06-20 13:26:00,1733,"I'll say it again. The guys who build the software for that are in Mississauga.  As in, Ontario. Canada.  The data center may be in the US, but the majority of workers providing that service are here."
707572,whiskywizard,2012-06-20 13:30:00,305,  well said.
707689,tooski,2012-06-20 19:17:00,12,Well I'm not sure what country is in charge of your licensing and outdoor cards but any change would be an upgrade...
707778,tschirk,2012-06-20 22:54:00,261,"With the Patriot act the US Gov can freely access the MNR data in the US, identify hunters and flag them as gun owners for additional scrutiny when crossing the border. Then with NSA algorithms they machine scan our posts, tweets, txt msgs, etc... then correlate the multiple sources of info to profile us as we travel to and around the US. Privacy does matter for honest citizens when overzealous police agencies take notice of you for any unassuming reason. Think of no-fly lists, where you cannot find out why you or someone with your same name gets listed and there is no way to get your name off."
708039,smally21,2012-06-21 18:24:00,993,are not gun owners already flagged as holders of POL/PAL's when they cross the border?  ted raised good points if the info does result in unearned scrutiny.
708052,jedimaster,2012-06-21 19:13:00,3472,"Don't forget that in the US, people generally don't give a rats ass about people that hunt because way more people already hunt down there and they are perceived as Redneck American freaks like we are perceived up here.  I don't care if they know, I would just the jobs rather stay here."

707191,iFish4real,2012-06-19 11:20:00,386,"I just got the July issue of Ontario Out of Doors magazine and I read this article on page 12 called Licensing Privacy Risk saying that Ontario's licensing information is being stored outside the country, when you call MNR to purchase licenses you can hear a message about this but I've never really paid attention to it...this is quoted from the magazine: ""Currently, Active Outdoors, a US-based company, administers Ontario's licensing, game-tag allocations and information collecting""  I don't know what you guys think about this and I hope nobody feels offended, but to me...it's retarded"
707192,Roy,2012-06-19 11:27:00,13728,We've discussed this before and I don't see what difference it makes.
707197,Stoty,2012-06-19 11:45:00,2910,I hear ya.... I agree that it should be stored inside Ontario.  Let's make a trade..... Leafs 1st and 2nd rd picks for all of our stored info back! They're bound to trade them for USELESS players... at least we'd get something USEFUL back!
707199,jigsnreels,2012-06-19 11:48:00,133,"It's all about competitive bidding for government services.  If Active Outdoors submitted the lowest bid to the MNR for info admin services, and they can do the job as well as anyone else, then they get the contract, and I'm fine with that.  After all, we're all ultimately paying for the service with our tax dollars, so if it keeps costs down and keeps our information secure at the same time, then it's all good.  We start to get into problems when we see non-competitive contracts go out for government projects, and we end up with things like skate shacks for the Rideau Canal that cost $750,000 each..."
707201,mercman,2012-06-19 11:51:00,7054, Its just a computer server anyways.I was surprised to find out that the a/c units in most government and many public offices are controlled by computers and people in Navada and South America
707203,Roy,2012-06-19 11:57:00,13728,Everybody in India has your home phone number and your bill payment history. Even Rachid called me yesterday to warn me that the freezer I bought at Sears is about to run out of waranty. His cousin Dipti asked him to remind me that I should also be looking to upgrade my life insurance.
707205,Stoty,2012-06-19 12:00:00,2910,Is that before or after your carpets get cleaned???
707216,iFish4real,2012-06-19 12:52:00,386,"yes of course competitive bidding...but what would you say if Canada would allow the imports of meat from China, India, wherever...it would be a lot cheaper right??? ...but it would kill Canadian farming industry and I would turn vegetarian  And btw, if government makes some savings like this it doesn't mean they will tax you less  "
707218,cram,2012-06-19 13:07:00,1733,"Cool the jets.  This isn't like buying your swiss chard from china.  I don't know where the data is stored, but most of the people building that software are based in Mississauga."

707222,Roy,2012-06-19 13:13:00,13728,Shiny side out Bill. Don't forget.
707223,whiskywizard,2012-06-19 13:15:00,305,  On a container ship coming from India.  we'll all have to wear aluminium pots until it arrives.
707356,Parisite,2012-06-19 19:58:00,66,"There is a little piece of legislation in the US of A called the Patriot Act which can put the privacy of Canadian's personal information at risk.  The US govt can access any Canadian's personal information if that information is outsourced to a US company.  If the MNR is outsourcing to a US based company and one of our names happens to match a name on the 'watch list' any info stored by that company can be accessed.  On a side note, anyone traveling into or through the US carrying a smartphone or laptop can have the memory and hard drives searched by US officials without the right to refuse."
707358,Terry,2012-06-19 20:06:00,14456,"yeah my god, what if homeland security finds out I have a 3 year fishing license and my home address.....  I don't see the big deal really..when they take over the canada pension and OHIP I will worry"
707360,BillM,2012-06-19 20:26:00,17367," Conspiracy theory aside, what are you so worried about?"
707363,smally21,2012-06-19 20:35:00,993,"but you willl (if it applies to you, insert name) go on a fishing forum talk about home insurance, boat tax, incomes, family history, tax returns, marriage and divorce, sickness, colonoscopy results, death/birth in the family, lost job, got a job, want a job, got a ticket, neighbours dog barks, secret coleslaw recipe, etc.  and then get freaked out cuz some yank knows yer address."
707371,jedimaster,2012-06-19 20:46:00,3472,"Personally I don't care who knows I hunt. The stickers on my car take care of that. As for the choice of using American resources, yah that part bothers me. Keep it in Canada if possible. I am pretty certain a Canadian company could do it."
707372,misfish,2012-06-19 20:48:00,29133,"   I have been looking for a decal that shows a bow hunter on a stand,with bow drawn. I have seen them,but cant find one."
707373,jedimaster,2012-06-19 20:50:00,3472,"Stand up and be counted or hide in the closet? I choose to be counted. I work and live smack in the GTA, 80 percent of my coworkers are liberal females. Every single one knows I fish and hunt. I have even taken a few fishing, and several want to come up with me to shoot some guns when I do some sighting in this fall."
707377,misfish,2012-06-19 20:55:00,29133," They want to learn to shoot,so they can protect themselves."
707378,jedimaster,2012-06-19 21:02:00,3472,Likely from me.

707435,smally21,2012-06-19 23:49:00,993,well first there is mayonaise...wait...active outdoors has eyes everywhere.  carry on like we weren't talking....
