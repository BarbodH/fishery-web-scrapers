Appreciate the tour of Simcoe and the perch. Got a good feed scheduled for tomorrow. Few too many dinks caught, but not for lack of trying. We fished from Barrie to Cooks Bay. Cliff the venison summer sausage is great. Skipper, the computer is fried. I only have the one pick of your bass and its not that great."
