708623,Dan668,2012-06-24 01:35:00,1120,Awesome. Missed bass opener. Stuck working the next two weeks because my boss took a holiday. Just had to leave for the opener! Anyone think the rain might hold off tomorrow. Considering scugog or cooks bay tomorrow during the day
708642,asdve23rveavwa,2012-06-24 02:49:00,2690,"Great morning to be out. Nicely done Terry, you'll get them next time Brian."

708687,davis,2012-06-24 14:24:00,128,Nice job. Was an awesome morning on Simcoe. We had the same results - boated over 20 by lunch. Most came right out from the grass. Fantastic opener
708519,misfish,2012-06-23 17:20:00,29133,"Im not going to say much,except,I suck.  This guy on the other hand,was putting on a clinic.Believe his number was 10/16.I stopped counting.  I cant believe I got smacked down. Losing my touch I guess.            Lets just say,the bass gods are against me,for turning to the dark side.  Hopefull things will change when we go smallie hunting buddy.. Thanks for the morning out."
708520,esoxansteel,2012-06-23 17:23:00,1307,"Lets see some fly rod Bass, you havnt turned to the dark side, just the elitist side"
708521,Spiel,2012-06-23 17:26:00,9065,"It looks like you were stuck in the back of the boat Brian, silly you.  Good stuff Terry and way to go keeping Brian at the back of the boat.  "

708527,kickingfrog,2012-06-23 17:33:00,8333, Yep back of the boat can be tough. Usually gotta go with a curveball.
708528,misfish,2012-06-23 17:39:00,29133," I did make a flip out in front of the boat,but the guy up front,flipped out."

708616,misfish,2012-06-24 01:08:00,29133, See how great a poacher I am.  Even you cant catch me. lm mis spelled
708617,kickingfrog,2012-06-24 01:12:00,8333,I believe that snapping turtles are the only turtle in Ontario that you can capture and consume legally if you have a licence.
708621,misfish,2012-06-24 01:21:00,29133,"I am fully aware of that Rob. My stringer, is just getting yanked by a young gun.    Seams to have a marsh theme to it."
