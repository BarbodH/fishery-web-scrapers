708104,misfish,2012-06-21 21:15:00,29133, Well said Bruce.   
708241,mirogak,2012-06-22 03:27:00,387," Good points there bud.  I have been fishing for two or three years now and if I hadn't come across this site, there would have been no way in hell to educate myself as much as I did in just the last few months.  It was only a few weeks ago where I learned what OOS stood for.  We do need to chill out a bit ... not everyone is bad at heart. Miro"
707877,Musky or Specks,2012-06-21 04:23:00,2710,Can someone PM me a link for this vid Im very interested
707879,Stoty,2012-06-21 04:30:00,2910,Same here.... I missed it!
707884,funfishing,2012-06-21 04:40:00,147,"It has since been removed from Youtube.  If you know how the Maitland typically looks, imagine a few guys fishing a pool. They catch I believe to be 3 smallmouth, of decent size, and release them, somewhat half-hazardly, but released nonetheless. They also catch a steelhead in the video. I think they called themselves the Bronte fishing club."
707890,SRT8 smoker craft,2012-06-21 06:06:00,1107," They new exactly what they were doing was wrong and if you read any of the comments you would have seen that, I also reported it and may have a copy if the MNR needs it"
707892,funfishing,2012-06-21 06:17:00,147, The comments showed that they did NOT know it was illegal.  Youtube comments - always a source of thoughtfulness and respect.
707917,DaveMc,2012-06-21 11:52:00,89, from what i read in the comments when the video was originally posted told me they knew full well that bass were out of season.
707991,DRIFTER_016,2012-06-21 15:28:00,10439,"   Well as luck would have it, I downloaded it before reporting it so that if it got taken down before the CO's got a chance to see it the proof would still be easily available.  I uploaded the file to my site. Be patient as the file needs to download to your machine before it starts playing.  OOS Bass Fishing Video  I also took a screen grab of the video description.  "
707997,UglyBug,2012-06-21 15:55:00,148,"Taking a picture while common is NOT! Legal, the reg's say any OOS species MUST be returned immediately to the water, taking a picture is NOT immediately. I happen to know a CO who will ticket you. so let's all beclear. It is not legal.....  Heres the section from the regulations   ""Fishing season opening and closing dates vary depending on the species and the area. It is illegal to attempt to catch fish for which the season is closed, even if you are going to release them. Fish accidentally caught during the closed season must be immediately released back into the water. Closed seasons protect fish at vulnerable times of the year, especially when they are spawning or protecting their young.""   "
708002,Terry,2012-06-21 16:09:00,14456," you name the amount of money and I will bet you that amount that it is not illegal to take a picture of an OOS fish.  oh and PS. members of this forum have emailed the MNR and posted the replies and while it could be possible to be charged while taking a photo, there is nothing illegal with taking photos of OOS fish"
708005,Spiel,2012-06-21 16:13:00,9065,"   By that logic anyone taking a picture of a slot sized walleye or slot sized musky, or any musky while fishing with a conservation license is breaking the law since they're not legally able to possess the fish."
708014,spinnerbaitking,2012-06-21 16:37:00,1622,"Talked to 2 C.O.'s at the Saugeen Bluffs Maple Syrup Festival & they said if you are caught taking a picture of an out of season Bass they would charge you, been told this before by other C.O's also, I've asked them after reading posts on different forums, we used to take some photos but not since I've talked to them back a few years ago, have a GREAT OPENER everyone Tight Lines SBK"
708017,Gregoire,2012-06-21 16:50:00,1397,"I started a conversation about this regarding Musky that are under the slot size earlier this year. There is a lot of room for interpretation in the regulations. As a result different CO's seem to interpret the regs in different ways. The fact that in Saugeen if you are seen taking a picture of an OOS bass you will get charged, but if you do the same thing in Kawarthas you will be fine. In the interest of not getting away from the topic too much I will not say any more about it. My problem with the video is the way the bass were treated. They had a net, net the fish, unhook the fish in the net and release the fish from the net. Letting fish role around on the rocks is not cool."
708018,Terry,2012-06-21 16:53:00,14456, I offer the bet you you to  you can not be convicted of taking photos of OOS fish
708021,kickingfrog,2012-06-21 16:59:00,8333,"Charged, convicted or convinced?"
708030,Terry,2012-06-21 17:20:00,14456,"lol  yeah some dumb CO could charge yo,u but no court would convict you"
708041,UglyBug,2012-06-21 18:26:00,148,Do what ever you want i really don't give a rats backside. just goes to show you the level of care some people have....So go ahead and justify whatever..  
708042,Gregoire,2012-06-21 18:33:00,1397," I have no doubt that with some effort, and the assistance of a lawyer that charge would be overturned, but not many of us have the resources in terms of time and money to fight such a charge."
708045,Terry,2012-06-21 18:43:00,14456,I will make the bet and will defend myself  and by the way there has never been anyone in ontario charged with taking photos of OOS fish ever.. about 5 years ago the MNR sponsored a winter derby on simcoe a muskie won the longest fish category along with a photo  and the same thing happen on Temagami an OOS fish won the MNR photo contest...no charges and they allow the entry and it won..
708049,misfish,2012-06-21 19:00:00,29133,"I finally watched the video. Is it normal practice in that area ,to use live minnows for trout?  My personal opinion is,Im fishing for trout,no problem. Bass are in the same area,no problem.Bass on,bass reeled in,released.  If a quick photo is to be taken,then do it quick.Don,t parade the darn thing around.And for letting the bass flop around on the rocks like they did,thats worse then taken an OOS pic of a fish.  Bottom line,they knew exactly what they were doing. IMO GUILTY.  Have I done something that others would find not kosher,yep,but I  wouldnt be throwing it out there on youtube."
708062,mercman,2012-06-21 19:49:00,7054,"MUST BE IMMEDIATELY RELEASED.  thats the law. But what is causeing the problem amongst us is the ETHICS of ANGLING  As good law abiding citizens and anglers with high ethics, we all would put the fish back in the water as gently as possible, with out pics.  In a perfect world, maybe, but i am sure there are pics of OOS fish in all of our personal photo books.  The problem is caused when photos are shown and bragged about on fishing forums and you tube.  This community, in the regs, frowns upon the display of OOS fish.Its not against any forum rules if you do, but its not an accepted practice.  In stateing that, this community is doing its part to stop OOS fishing and poaching, IMO.  By removeing the audience, you remove what drives these people to do such things.  Legal ? No  Common Practie? Yup.Unfortunately so."
708069,smally21,2012-06-21 20:02:00,993,"Does anyone know about the bronte fishing club? Are all of their members travelling around filming rock flopping oos fish caught one after another? IMO these guys  got all dressed up to go fishing and dont care what they catch as long as they get something to post. Personally, i wouldnt  want this video to represent my fishing club. Pick up the fish! Ya got gloves on sally!"
708070,jedimaster,2012-06-21 20:07:00,3472,"I have have had a lengthy discussion with this several times with several CO's as well as office staff at the MNR. They way its written is to allow the CO discretion in laying a charge.... EG you catch a Bass out of season, snap a pic and return it, no harm no foul, CO lets you off. You catch a Bass Take its picture, drop it, pick it up toss it in the livewell while you get your camera batteries changed, take it out, take a picture, measure it, spend a few minutes reviving it in the water and let it go. The CO can charge you at the there discretion.  Be careful, be mindful and use your head. I don't take pictures of OOS fish purposely because i am afraid I am the one thats gonna be made an example of. If its oos, it goes right back in asap. End of story."
708079,Terry,2012-06-21 20:38:00,14456," and you almost hit the nail on the head the regs. summary doesn't give enough detail but the long winded full regs. do and if you handle a fish took long ie: taking many photos or leaving the fish on the deck while you are doing something else or putting it on a stringer or livewell they will say that fish is now in your possession at that point they can charge you if it's OOS or a fish in the release slot or a fish with 0 limit... if it's a legal fish even if you release it it can count against your limit. because they have determined you had it in your possession now if the fish floats to the surface, that is even more charges if it's OOS...but the taking of the photo is not a chargeable act ... taking to long as to imply possession of the fish is a chargeable offense and in defense of taking photos they have stated that taking photos of muskie with a 0 limit license is perfectly legal....unless the fish dies , then it goes back to the charge because you kept it long enough to have possession of the fish"
708087,jedimaster,2012-06-21 20:54:00,3472,"I didn't want all the glory, I'll hold the nail you can swing the hammer... just let me know when your on the way down so I can let go of the nail."
708088,capt bruce,2012-06-21 20:54:00,820,"All I can add to this is Myself and all my Extended family have hunted and fished for over 50 years in Ontario and thu out Canada and the U.S. and NOT A ONE !!! has ever been charged by a CO . Been stopped checked out hundreds of times over the years , BUT NEVER been charged .. Its not that hard guys , read the regs error on the side of caution , no folding over the tails or streching them out to meet the slot limits , leave skin on fillets , no oss fish , if your fishing pike and all you are getting is bass MOVE, no going too close to damns ,etc. etc. ,Your only hurting yourself because if you truely love fishing YOU WILL DO EVERYTHING you can to not harm the resourse ."
707695,DRIFTER_016,2012-06-20 19:33:00,10439,Last week there was a thread poseted about an OOS smallmouth bass fishing video. At the time I sent in a complaint to the MNR about the video. Well I just got an email back from them. Enjoy!!!! 
707707,UglyBug,2012-06-20 20:00:00,148,:good:
707708,Roy,2012-06-20 20:04:00,13728,"Well I for one am glad that they're ""actioning"" on it.  edited to add: Maybe the wrong icon used there. You just so seldom see the present participle of some words."
707710,Live2fish85,2012-06-20 20:07:00,1633,Good to hear.
707717,funfishing,2012-06-20 20:35:00,147,"MNR:  ""Hey guys. Glad that you were out enjoying sport fishing. Looks like you guys are well on your way towards becoming accomplished anglers. Nice high quality gear by the way. Fishing is a wonderful contributor to our economy. Your license fees allow me to feed my family - thanks for that.  I see you were out doing some late season steelhead fishing on the beautiful Maitland River. That's awesome. Very generous of you guys to film your adventures and put them online for others to enjoy. I see that you happened into some OOS smallmouth, and released them all. Good on you guys. You guys probably didn't know, but catching OOS fish and releasing them is still technically illegal.  Allow me to clarify. If you come here again for late season steelhead, try to fish pools and use baits that allow you to hook up with steel but keep the bass off. If you find you are consistently catching bass, the law stipulates that you need to switch baits or move on to another pool, so as to avoid catching OOS bass.  Since you guys posted this video online, you obviously weren't intentionally breaking the law.  We've had some anglers send in your video to complain. So we thought it would be fair to give you guys this warning, so next time you can follow the regs appropriately.  If you guys only caught a few incidental bass, and released them all, you did not break any laws. Taking a picture with an OOS fish is legal. Try to be as gentle as possible with the release of fish. This comes with practice and experience."""
707718,funfishing,2012-06-20 20:36:00,147,"Or some unreasonable, insane CO can try and charge them, because, my God, look what they've done!"
707728,Terry,2012-06-20 20:51:00,14456,"the guy who chopped up the student did it on video and posted it on-line so I guess he didn't know it was wrong/illegal to kill a person and send the body parts around the country  some insane cop can try and charge him, because, my God, look what they've done!"
707729,funfishing,2012-06-20 20:56:00,147,"I can't believe you brought that up on a fishing forum, speechless. Mods best delete that asap, that's disgusting.  I for one will not perpetuate the cynical attitude that all people are inherently ""bad"" and need to be ""disciplined"", the attitude that is behind so much of society's woes.  Just awful.   "

707750,misfish,2012-06-20 21:25:00,29133, Answer the real question please.  Dave is a true standing member with fact.
707751,SirCranksalot,2012-06-20 21:27:00,3291,"I posted the original thread---twice---and it got deleted both times. I assume it must have been a software glitch because there didn't seem to be any good reason to delete. I know God works in mysterious ways, but there seems to be a lot of that going around."
707752,funfishing,2012-06-20 21:27:00,147,"I just hate to see phronemophobia, especially directed at fellow anglers.  Educate your fellow anglers and treat them with respect. I mentioned in the first post on this topic, that these guys obviously are not experienced anglers based on how they were trying to hold that steelhead in the vid. Not everyone has the privilege of being taught to fish as kids. Many are self-taught later in life and don't have decades of experience. Learning takes time.  Please refer to my first post in this thread if you need to be reminded that there are ambiguities surrounding the laws of OOS fish. Not everyone will immediately comprehend them - I guarantee you many on this forum think that it's illegal to take a photograph with an OOS fish - it isn't!  Currently there is no test administered by the MNR that an angler must pass prior to obtaining their license. If you can't bare the sight of someone catching OOS bass, you should write the MNR and petition for a test. And you should also avoid all of the Kawartha Lakes before opener - because everyday guys are catching oodles of OOS bass and feigning innocence when they are the ones that do know better."
707753,NAW,2012-06-20 21:27:00,4022,Good on ya Drifter.  No comment on anything else in the thread.
707756,funfishing,2012-06-20 21:29:00,147,"I am glad that Knuguy posted this thread initially, as it brings to the table grounds for a productive discussion. We need to encourage thinking, not censor it."
707758,Terry,2012-06-20 21:38:00,14456,and I think we should let the MNR decide the outcome and ignore peoples personal opinions base on their opinions and not on facts  you might even be right or you could be dead wrong
707761,Marko,2012-06-20 21:42:00,854,so what exactly happened/? was somebody fishing for steelhead and catching bass accidentally or some people were being stupid and catching bass out of season and filming it?
707767,funfishing,2012-06-20 21:49:00,147," Thank you Terry.  These guys might have been breaking the law. They might have been breaking the law intentionally. If they drove to the Maitland to target bass that day.  They also might have simply caught a few incidental bass, filmed it, and posted it on youtube. Not illegal.  My own fishing experience tells me, that based on viewing how those men handled that steelhead, that they are relatively new to fishing, however successful they may be at catching. Each of those guys will have a different amount of experience.  I hope they don't waste too much time and taxpayers money. Signs indicating that bass are off limits, even with C&R, posted along the Maitland River - would be a great step forward and cost effective."
707769,DRIFTER_016,2012-06-20 21:55:00,10439,"In the US they use online videos against ""sportsmen"" all the time. Sometimes the person in the video makes a mistake and sometimes they know exactly what they are doing. For instance, earlier this year Ted Nugent was convicted of an offence in Alaska. He was up filming a bear hunt and winged a bear with his arrow. They tracked the bear and after quite a long time determined that the bear was ok and merely winged. They carried on with the hunt and harvested a nice bear. Unfortunately by winging the previous bear under Alaska law they should have stopped hunting because in the regs when you take a shot at an animal it is considered in your bag limit if you hit it or not. By law Ted's hunt was over the second he released the arrow. Unfortunately neither he or any of his crew knew about this law as their hunting regs are like Ontario's fishing regs.  Any how, someone saw a video online of him missing the first bear and then harvesting a bear and let the ADFG know about it. Ted was charged with taking game without a license as he only had one bear tag. He plead guilty and paid his fines and did a bunch of public service pieces to air during his show.  So you see anyone can make a mistake and if they aren't made aware of their mistake it will continue. Even if the guy who posted the vid is only made aware of the error of his ways that is good in my books.  So you see I only want to educate the feller about the error of his ways."
707772,Roy,2012-06-20 22:18:00,13728,And you did well. Thanks Dave.
