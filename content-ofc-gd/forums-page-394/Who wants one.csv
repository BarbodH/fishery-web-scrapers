708089,blaque,2012-06-21 20:59:00,2419,Something ive been toying around with in my CAD programs  Machining it would be a whole different story.  
708091,misfish,2012-06-21 21:01:00,29133,"Now your just teasing me.  Nicely done.  I would ask the guys in the engineering room to design one,but were so frigg,n busy.  If you market that,let me know.LOL"
708093,davey buoy,2012-06-21 21:05:00,5505,Be nice as rims on my ford:lol:.
708094,blaque,2012-06-21 21:06:00,2419," lmao, you got me interested in doodling again"
708096,blaque,2012-06-21 21:07:00,2419," Modeled in Autodesk Inventor, and rendered in Studio"
708098,capt bruce,2012-06-21 21:08:00,820,"You get them made , Im in for two ."
708099,misfish,2012-06-21 21:09:00,29133," Stop doodling,and make.LOL  That is a sweet design."
708100,NAW,2012-06-21 21:10:00,4022,I was going to say.  That background image in the mirrors sure looks like Inventor to me.  Are you a CAD jockey?
708133,krixxer,2012-06-21 22:29:00,274,"making the parts would be the easy task.  finishing it to make it look that nice will triple the price.  hours upon hours of de-burring, polishing, plating/anodizing/masking installation. .........only to find out that some tolerances are out by a few microns.   does that not look like a car rim? "
708139,crappieperchhunter,2012-06-21 22:42:00,2582,I have a table fan at the cottage that looks just like that
708142,Moosebunk,2012-06-21 22:47:00,3970,That's some pretty slick designing there!!!
708143,misfish,2012-06-21 22:47:00,29133," Welcome to the center pin club ,,,,,,,,,,,,  :rofl2:"
708148,steel&chrome,2012-06-21 22:57:00,46,can you provide spec's? maybe I can machine it
708152,blaque,2012-06-21 23:02:00,2419, I am indeed lol. And yep u can see the telltale autodesk parking lot reflection in the center nut of the reel
708155,blaque,2012-06-21 23:13:00,2419," Everything is modeled except the ""spoke"" section of the reel, which is a wheel design decaled onto the model"
708174,BillM,2012-06-21 23:45:00,17367,Looks like something you'd find on an Escalade
708176,misfish,2012-06-21 23:48:00,29133, I should send him a pic of your left rear rim Bill. That would be a nice reel design.  :rofl2:
708216,blaque,2012-06-22 02:03:00,2419," If autocad has parametric 3d capabilities, it would be news to me. I rarely launch autocad anymore lol. Modeling was all inventor.  However with my premium suite license I get all kinds of add ons I'm excited about. 3dsmax being one of them.  Ive done some work with solid works here and there.....nice program"
708219,backbay,2012-06-22 02:14:00,773,"Um, do you have anything by Cragar, or maybe an old-school spoke look?"
708222,blaque,2012-06-22 02:18:00,2419,"Cragar....lol, how 70's"
708225,backbay,2012-06-22 02:21:00,773,"lol, how 60s! But a pretty enduring design, I think."
