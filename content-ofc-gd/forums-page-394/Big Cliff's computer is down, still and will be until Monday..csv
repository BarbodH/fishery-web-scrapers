708451,camillj,2012-06-23 00:51:00,1988,Sorry to hear Cliff .. if you still have the hard drive and need to save something from it ... I have some 'special' tools for that ... cant promise ya it will work but if its real important ( pictures etc) it is worth a shot ... drop on by and we will give it the old college try

I used them when my iMac went south and they recovered pretty well everything and placed it on a portable drive. Cost, as can be expected, varies depending on how deep you want them to dig.  http://www.cbldatarecovery.com/"
