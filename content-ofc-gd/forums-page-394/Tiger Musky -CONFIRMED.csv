707777,Pikeslayer,2012-06-20 22:37:00,1443,"Probably a good time for: The rest of the story......... My childhood friend was T boned while fishing on a 16 ft tinny by a (very wealthy) drunk piloting a Scarab (I think 35 ft CC) approx 22 yrs ago. He drowned, was rescued and revived. End result, he functions at the level of an 8 yr old but never has to worry about $$$$ for the rest of his life. He loves to fish (travels the world with his caretaker, NZ marlin fishing he survived another near drowning when he and his chair were pulled overboard by a black marlin but that's another story...) and takes particular joy in enjoying his harvest where/when allowed (CT is quite the chef BTW). BUT,  he does have a clear understanding that there are rules for possession and ethics for C & R for fish & seasons. he just can't decipher them. There is no doubt he is catching tigers. His CT has sent me clear photos and I have verified them. So given the confirmation of the regs & big assists from Sinclair & Craig (thx BTW), I emailed CT and told him to go for it (as long as I'm invited for dinner). And Mike P., there's no doubt in my mind that there will be another replica added to his (most impressive) collection  Thx to all for the input.  Slayer."

708010,Lunker Larry,2012-06-21 16:32:00,122,"In regareds to eating muskie, being an apex predator the MNR lists them as toxic in the consumption guide so it's not a good idea. With the spread of pike throughout our waterways, tiger muskies are becoming more prevalent meaning, pike will eventually displace muskie in those waters. Pike spawn 2 weeks before muskie and they share the same spawning areas. Both species are canabilistic so with the pike hatching first, muskie become a food supply."
708023,whiskywizard,2012-06-21 17:08:00,305,"My copy of the guide to eating Ontario sport fish says this...  ""Consumption tables in this guide do not provide advisories for muskellunge. To maintain healthy muskellunge populations, the Ministry of Natural Resources encourages catch and release of this species as it generally cannot sustain heavy fishing pressure. If you do wish to keep a legal-sized muskellunge for consumption, it will likely have elevated mercury levels, and should not be consumed by women of child-bearing age and children under 15. Trophy-sized muskellunge usually have very high mercury levels and should not be consumed by anyone."" "

TIGER MUSKY is a hybrid but still falls under the same regulations as MUSKY.  So my next question is; Seeing as the tiger musky is a hybrid, would the same 'ethics' apply in terms of catch and release practices? Would one get 'flamed' for actually harvesting a tiger musky????  Ps. Keep in mind that I am inquiring on behalf of a friend, so please don't shoot the messenger.  Thx, Slayer     I touched base with an old friend/fishing buddy of mine and he told me he is catching an 'unusual' amount of 'Tiger Musky' on his lake this year. Unfortunately, he is functionally illiterate and unable to read at the required level to interpret our regulations. He asked me if I could find out what the MNR regulations were specific to catch/possession limits. So after spending a little time on line today, I have come up with zero, zilch, zippo. The only useful information I have found on the site is:  tiger muskellunge (pike-muskellunge hybrids)  So do tiger muskys fall under Musky or Pike when interpretting the regulations? Anybody have any additional insite?? I figure somebody with 'musky' in their name or avatar might know??  Thx, Slayer "

707024,Terry,2012-06-18 21:36:00,14456,Tiger muskie are designated as a muskie by the MNR and they have the same length and catch limit as regular muskie unless stated in the exceptions for each area

While I can see the confusion in identifying the regulations for tigers, as they are not clearly identified as a species in the regulations the link below instructs people to the KTD signage, indicating that Tigers are considered musky, and as such are subject to the same regulations http://www.mnr.gov.on.ca/en/Business/LetsFish/2ColumnSubPage/STEL02_173217.html I did do a web search and found information on this topic to be lacking, but as a general rule when interpreting laws and regulations you should err on the side of caution, which would mean treating Tigers as Musky."

I release all my muskie and would do the same with a tiger. Ikeep the odd pike for a fish fry and don't mind doing so since they are farmore plentiful than muskies. The areas I fish have both species available. Ihave never caught or even seen a live tiger muskie but would consider it a privilegeto do so. "

While I personally wouldn't harvest one, I don't know if the same type of ""let them live to spwan"" reasoning is generally followed with a hybrid?  Would be interested in hearing others take on it as well."

But muskie of any kind are pretty valuable fish - too valuable to be caught just once.  Besides, I might be the guy who catches it again next time around, when it's even bigger.  Why anyone would kill a muskie is beyond me. There are far better eating fish out there, and replica mounts look absolutely fantastic. There's just no valid reason to bonk one."

707732,esoxansteel,2012-06-20 20:58:00,1307,"1st if the Tiger Muskie meets the minimum length requirements, you are within your rights to harvest, with a proper license, why would you want to harvest the fish in the first place, when there is much finer table fare out there for consumption, and if you want one for the wall consider the replica mounts, which will last much longer, and have come along way since there inception, if hes catching alot please post us some pics as they are a beautifully naturally occuring hybrid, that do not need a test tube and man's help."
707738,jedimaster,2012-06-20 21:04:00,3472,"I would think they would taste similar to pike, and people really enjoy eating pike. Once you learn how to fillet them that is. As for why? I wouldn't, but then again I don't eat pike either. I think if walleye got to 50 and 60inches long people would have a faux pas against eating those as well.
