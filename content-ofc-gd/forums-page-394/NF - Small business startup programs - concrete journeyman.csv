Self employment can be a strain, but amazing if you make it. Community Futures Development usually provides some grants for companies starting up that have a strong business plan. They are worth checking out."

I started a small business 6 yrs ago with personal savings and just thought I would deal with my existing bank at the time (TD). Despite the JD Power Bull, they really don't care about the little guy (based on my personal experience). Then one day (approx 3 yrs ago) out of the blue, a Scotia representative showed up at my place of business doing a 'cold call' introducing herself to the area businesses. After speaking with her for 15-20 minutes, I was determined to give Scotia a try out. I placed a just enough of a deposit on account to manage my payables. Long story short, 3 months later I walked into the TD bank, got a six figure draft and closed my account. It took my TD account manager 6 weeks to call and ask why I had closed my account.  Just my experience and food for thought. Best of luck to you.  Slayer"
