708618,Joey,2012-06-24 01:15:00,9122, You home Rich?
708653,lew,2012-06-24 09:21:00,12766,"Always fun spending time with you guys Joey and as usual your pictures turned out fantastic.  We left about 6:30 yesterday morning and got home about noon.  Here's a few pictures I got with you, Paul & Ralphie.  See you again in a few weeks.                "
708662,Roy,2012-06-24 11:51:00,13728,"Super report, Joey. Glad to see everyone had a good time. Fantastic pics in there too! With a little luck I'll be able to make it up around August sometime."
708674,Rich Clemens,2012-06-24 13:24:00,3131,"  We pulled out around 4:30am and got home around 3:30pm.  11 hours as expected.   One little surpise coming home up on 69.  Driving along and hear something hit the side of the truck.  Patsy looked back and it looked like a crow that was along the road decided to take flight and smacked into the truck.  Not a sound I like to hear ...  stupid bird.  No damage.  Traffic was fine except when we crossed Hamilton Harbor on QEW.  From there to our side of Niagara, it was pretty busy. For some reason, everyone likes the middle lane and quite often, don't even go the speed limit.      But, it was a good trip home and it's good to sleep in an air conditioned bedroom.  Hope you all have fun up there in August."
708689,Joey,2012-06-24 14:38:00,9122,"Glad you and Lew are both home safe Rich.  Wonder why the crow decided to fly into your truck?  Glad there was no damage.  Yes, the slowpokes can screw up traffic and is a general annoyance of Paul's on that trip.  But we're all home safe and sound and had a good time, and that's all that matters.  Air conditioning definately rules"
708832,spincast,2012-06-24 23:47:00,3279,great report - the shots of Lew casting are v. cool. Looks like a great time was had by all.
707969,Jds63,2012-06-21 14:04:00,1365,Great pictures ... love the video of Ralphie snoring ....
707988,fishnsled,2012-06-21 15:22:00,3520,"Great report and pictures Joey, looks like everyone enjoyed themselves and you're making others wish they had gone. Hopefully there will be a bigger group next year."
707998,Joey,2012-06-21 15:57:00,9122," We hung at Lew's or our cabin site, or mostly down at the dock really.  Was nice and relaxing!"
707999,Joey,2012-06-21 15:58:00,9122," I sure hope so Will, many were    surely missed!!   Thanks for the kind words on my pictures everyone, really appreciate it.  Sometimes I'm not sure which I want more in my hands, my rod or my camera"
708000,ehg,2012-06-21 15:59:00,2666,"Excellent photographs!  From the yellow bellied sapsucker, osprey fighting over bullhead, Lew casting musky spinnerbait, pickeral, etc... looks like a good time outdoors."
708001,aplumma,2012-06-21 16:04:00,6896,Thanks for all of the photos I am down here sweating in the upper 90's wishing I was a little further North right now.   Art
708013,Joey,2012-06-21 16:37:00,9122," Thanks Art.  You won't find any relief up here tho, the temp is the same if not hotter  As Diane said yesterday, chair in the water day"
708145,Moosebunk,2012-06-21 22:52:00,3970,Bunch o' doggers up there this year at the L.A. eh!?!? lol.  Like the pics of the loons and Lew.     Kinda go together nicely.    j/k   Good times all!!!
708187,FisherJuli,2012-06-22 00:19:00,125,Great pics-- I especially like the osprey and the ones of Ralphie! It looks like you had a fantastic time!
708197,Rich Clemens,2012-06-22 00:54:00,3131,"Some great shots - but why the snake ? Glad you folks could come up for a while.  For a while there, Patsy and I thought we'd be all alone - so we really appreciated the good friends.  Too bad abount the camp fires, but we did have some heavy rain, but that didn't stop the fishing.  Had dinner with Lew and Di this evening in their cabin and we've spent the last couple afternoons over there - enjoying the shade.     One more day and we have to head home as well.   Hope to put something up this week-end.   Oh yeah - did you eat all your coke bottles yet ?  We're already booked for next year for the musky opener.  Hopefully we all can hook up again."
708201,Dutch,2012-06-22 01:09:00,831,"Wow - amazing pics, thanks for the report."
708217,bucktail,2012-06-22 02:06:00,1857,"Nice photos girl, you have really gotten the hang of the camera, you just needed a nice 55 inch beast to set the weekeend off!    Thanks for the pictures I loved them    Darren  "
708218,BillM,2012-06-22 02:13:00,17367,"Joey, your pics are getting better and better!  I am jealous of that 100-400mm!!!"

708237,Joey,2012-06-22 03:00:00,9122," Was great seeing you guys again too, and ya, too bad about no campfires.  Safe drive home guys, and I finished the first pack of coke bottles today, will start the next pack tomorrow     Thanks for those"

708258,corvette1,2012-06-22 08:27:00,1765,great report joey looks like a great time awesome pictures

708507,Squid,2012-06-23 15:18:00,1656,Wow Joey!! What an awesome report with super photos!!
708509,Spiel,2012-06-23 15:32:00,9065,I'm a little this   and a little this.  But well done and thank you.
708513,Joey,2012-06-23 16:04:00,9122," Yes, Kev, you can use any pics you want  Glad you taught Lew how to avoid those pesky muskies"
708515,Whopper,2012-06-23 16:13:00,2174,"Excellent report J The pics are outstanding, well done"
708562,Christopheraaron,2012-06-23 22:32:00,3525, I Like it. Great report and shots!
708605,Rich Clemens,2012-06-24 00:29:00,3131,  Yeah.    Lew was keeping the pike out of my way. (ha ha ha)
707840,Joey,2012-06-21 02:31:00,9122,"Paul and I decided last minute to head up to Lakair to join Lew, Diane, Marvin, Rich and Patsy, and for one night Dan Bouck.  We had a great time and wished we didn't have to leave.  Weather was off and on, hot, rain, storms, we got it all.  This was Ralphie's first time up north and he was a bit skittish at first, but loved it after that.  He and Marvin made fast friends, even Digger came around to liking Ralphie in the end.  We arrived about 3:30 on Saturday, a little later than we had anticipated as Paul realized as we passed Holland Marsh that he had forgotten the trolling motor.  So a turn around at the Bradford turn off and back home to Richmond Hill we went.  Added a bit of time to our travels  When we got there we were welcomed by Leslie, then Lew and Diane and Marvin.  Rich and Patsy came by after fishing and Dan arrived a bit later.                 Best Buddies!!!    And Lakair just wouldn't be Lakair without Digger!    Took Ralphie for a walk and got some wildlife shots.        A very sappy tree    We had a crappy Sunday with rain and storms.  Woke up to thunder but headed out in the afternoon for some muskie.  We only managed a few pike (didn't take any pics of them) but found Lew out pounding the water          These loons did a nice little dance for us            These next photos are a sequence of two osprey fighting over a fish.  The first osprey caught it and was trying to land in a tree to eat it and the other was trying to steal it from him/her.  It was pretty far away so I'm at full zoom and the boat was moving in the waves but I did the best I could.  The original osprey managed to keep its catch and ate it.                  Still trying, circling!    Finally he gets to eat in peace     Some seagull shots      The crew down on the dock!!          Eventually, a few needed a nap.  Marvin went to sleep in his chair with a little coaxing, Ralphie in my lap, and Paul on a rock        We had a few visitors down there too          We did manage a few fishing pics.  I got a couple of pickerel (we went out most nights fishing for them) and got a good 20 incher for our team, and Paul got a 9.5 inch perch for the team     Unfortunately, the bigger one was in the slot, so back she went, actually, we never kept any of the fish caught.  Let them get bigger    The deer in the headlights look      Ralphie did awesome in the boat and eventually we let him run around free in it without tying him up.  He is a great fishing/boat dog now.  The waves and fresh air tend to tire him easily tho.  See how stresed he is here :    So it's back to work tomorrow, but it was a fantastic few days off with some wonderful company.  Thanks to Lew, Diane, Rich and Patsy for the great company, and Dan for the short time he was there.  Thanks to Marvin for teaching Ralphie how to swim, and thanks to Leslie and Kevin for the great service and accomodations.  We had a super time.  Joey"

Woodenboater, the deer flies were a pain during the day, and the mosquitos came out at 9:20 sharp each evening.  No campfires for us this year.  They were nasty, especially after the rain."
