707736,moxie,2012-06-20 21:03:00,1566,Friends of the family have recently purchased a small cabin in the woods in the Arden area and we have been invited for the Canada Day long weekend. Since they are as unfamiliar with the area as I am I was wondering if anyone on the Board has any knowledge of the area as far as which lakes to access and how accessible the access. They are situated close to Buck Lake and my Rig is a 16ft Crestliner. I realize I've asked for enough already but  any info above and beyond the access would be greatly appreciated as well. Thank you.
