34429,Cast-Away,2007-02-14 12:45:00,790,"What part of the bay are you staying in? If it is the east part, there are Pike and Perch. From the government dock west, it is pretty much only Salmon."
34659,Gary George,2007-02-14 23:13:00,33,Not to far from the Government Dock directly across from the Indian reserve.  I think it's fairly deep water.
34661,Cast-Away,2007-02-14 23:19:00,790,My buddies and I use to fish right around the area in the winter and never had any luck. Granted we were fishing near shore hoping for Perch. In the summer I see locals trolling out towards the mouth of the Bay with down riggers on. I fish down near the east end of 12 Mile in the summer and catch Pike and Perch there.
34664,irishfield,2007-02-14 23:23:00,26272,Should be fish around that one island..shouldn't there?  
34678,GbayGiant,2007-02-14 23:38:00,1780," Not fare Irish, you get the birds eye view of all the potential hot spots."
34681,Cast-Away,2007-02-14 23:42:00,790,"Wayne you are very funny! I remember asking you to take those pictures! The end of the bay closer to your plane is where the Pike are in the summer. The whole bay around the island on both sides is 30 feet deep or less.  Sorry RivRat, the fishing in 12 Mile is not very good at the best of times."
34778,Gary George,2007-02-15 02:30:00,33,Thanks Guy's  I probably won't bother then.
34842,bdzyngel,2007-02-15 06:26:00,6,"RivRat,  I fished off my friend's cottage in February 2 years ago close to where you are talking about and caught about a dozen perch, a 10 pound laker and a ling.  The ling bite was good after dark...  Good luck.  Bruce"
708483,bunhead,2012-06-23 06:10:00,1,I know this is an old topic but wondering if anyone has any new information on the salmon and trout fishing off of 12 Mile Bay or the San Sousi area.    Thanks
