707773,Broker,2012-06-20 22:19:00,482,"Hey guys, going to Algonquin to fish for some trout this summer ( and bass but I have the tackle for bass..) and I'm heading out to do some shopping for lures and whatnot for the trip. Will be using both the Spin and fly rod, so what would you suggest for lures and flies? Thanks"
707821,Ainsley,2012-06-21 01:32:00,142,In the summer the lake and brook trout are in the deeper parts of the lake. I usually troll spoons or small jointed rapalas on a 3-way rig with 1 to 2 ounce weights.
707827,Broker,2012-06-21 01:45:00,482,"Thanks , my plan is to troll during the day and toss flies at dusk an dawn.. Is it worth my time to fly fish ? Heard that the trout come into shallows to feed"
707843,BillM,2012-06-21 02:33:00,17367,"If there's a hatch you might get a few fish on dries, if not pulling a streamer with a sink tip (Letting pretty much all your line out) is a good way to get them trolling."
707870,chris.brock,2012-06-21 03:50:00,4053,"I'm guessing the flyrod won't be any good for the brookies or lakers in the summer, I'm assuming you won't have a sonar unit, try to find (guess-ti-mate) 40 to 70 feet of water and vertical jig just off bottom with a spoon for lakers"
707873,Musky or Specks,2012-06-21 04:10:00,2710,Flyfishing summer trout in lakes is a tough go. I'd fish wolf river rigs with Yozuri minnows or a perch rapala.
707903,Christopheraaron,2012-06-21 11:00:00,3525,"Depends where you are, there are some pretty decent rivers up there as well."
707911,Broker,2012-06-21 11:36:00,482,"Starting in rock lake, and heading into the interior from there"
707927,Ainsley,2012-06-21 12:21:00,142,"Pick yourself up the depth contour map book. I believe it has rock lake in it, if you're doing a circuit it also has Louisa which is a gorgeous lake. If you do hit up Louisa let me know, I was there last year and caught many lakers."
708083,Broker,2012-06-21 20:39:00,482,Is there a point of even trying for trout on rock ? Or would it be a waste of time that i could be on the other lakes?
708234,mirogak,2012-06-22 02:52:00,387,"They are tough enough in the spring and fall, summer is going to be way harder.  The 3 way jig might be your only option."
708246,SirCranksalot,2012-06-22 04:17:00,3291,Find a river mouth at dusk and use flies.
