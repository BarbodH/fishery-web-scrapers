Trying to figure out if i should haul the boat for the 4 1/2 hr drive    I have a 19 ` Alum mostly used for  great lakes fishing  .. Just wondering what the lake is like.  Any  bad spots  to keep a eye on. Should i bring the riggers. Anyone know of a map  for the area i  found one online however  it never showed  that much . Not looking for any hot  spots just a general idea  We are camping at lake bernard camp not sure  how good thier ramp facilties are..   Thanks    yep thanks for that fishlogic

708167,adempsey,2012-06-21 23:31:00,1498,"I am not sure if you mean Lake Bernard in Sundridge or not, but if so, here is a map of the lake I found online.  Not sure if that's what you were looking for?   Don't know much else about the lake as I've only fished it in the winter."
708202,Nipfisher,2012-06-22 01:13:00,2449,"  You won't need a boat that big for Bernard. Might save some gas and see if there is a boat you can rent there. If you do bring your boat bring your down riggers. No bad spots on the lake...in fact...it is the world's largest body of fresh water without an island. Fish species in the lake include smallmouth bass, lake trout, whitefish, yellow perch and rock bass. Because Lake Bernard is large and deep, fishing is relatively poor for bass, but quite good for lake trout and whitefish."

708209,reelinrolly,2012-06-22 01:42:00,281,I'll be up at the cottage on July 5th to July 8th which is two minutes from lake Bernard camp.  There is a very shallow launch right in front of the camp ground. There is a better launch on the other side of the lake in Sunridge  Definitely bring downriggers as you will want to troll deep for lakers. There are also a few rainbows in the lake. I have done quite well for smallmouth as well in front of high rock  and Bernard creek as well as in the shallows close to Sunridge  If you are up for a short drive there is a great largie / smallie and pike lake five minutes north of Sunridge. Message me if u want details  Have fun up there it's a beautiful lake be sure to take the kids up to high rock lookout it's pretty neat
