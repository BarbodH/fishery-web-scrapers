704174,fishinfool,2012-06-09 14:27:00,366,"Hello All Heading up with the wife July 9/12 to do some Walleye fishing. It will be my first time on Red Cedar, I usually fish Marten River. It looks like a pretty big lake! Looking for any advice on what to watch out for in regards to shoals, shallows etc and any tips on where to start for the eyes would be much appreciated. Not looking for exact co-ordinates, just a starting point or two. Thanks in advance. Stan"
704388,fishinfool,2012-06-10 17:04:00,366,"Anyone!! ?? I thought someone would have some input, maybe nobody has fished this lake..."
704452,Rod Caster,2012-06-10 21:21:00,5784,"I was gonna respond since I fish this area a lot... Unfortunately for you, I've never tried Red Cedar and have no real tips for you. I've actaully avoided it because I prefer the smaller/harder to access lakes with my canoe.  Best of luck either way!"

705871,davew3,2012-06-14 18:41:00,430,"fishinfool,  are you staying at the North camp or the South camp? When I stayed at the north camp we fished at night right out front with minnows.  Seemed to be the best.  Also from the North camp if you keep to the right you will come to a small dam.  In front of that worked.  Also down below. Just make noise when walking and keep your eyes and ears open.  Regards"
706218,fishinfool,2012-06-15 23:35:00,366, Any Luck TJ?
706219,fishinfool,2012-06-15 23:37:00,366," Hey davew I'm not sure what camp I'll be at. I will be sure and check out the damn though. What did you mean ""just make noise when walking and keep your eyes and ears open""? Are there lots of bears in the area or what??? lol"
707694,fishinfool,2012-06-20 19:30:00,366," Hey TJ, any luck with that map??  Stan"
707700,TJQ,2012-06-20 19:44:00,7806,"Yup I got it!!! Pm me an email address, ill scan it and send it."
707929,TheLegend2012,2012-06-21 12:34:00,7,"4 summers and 3 summers went here we stayed at 2 different lodges and didnt have much walleye success. We trolled for hrs a day and 4 of us caught under 10 in a week. A buddy of mine who has been going for about 7 yrs also stopped going although we did mark plenty of fish we certainly didnt catch many. I no the fall is real good but we went both times in july. Hope you do better than we did, this time were trying a place in sudbury for something different"
707943,TJQ,2012-06-21 13:07:00,7806,Ive fished it a few time. I do know that for some reason the night bite is better for pickerel and live bait is a must.
707950,Spiel,2012-06-21 13:23:00,9065,"I've stayed at the North Camp a few times and yes, night is when they bite and some real brutes too! As mentioned not far from the docks and our most productive lure was a good ole Mepps 3."
707951,davew3,2012-06-21 13:23:00,430,"This is who we stayed with, at thier north camp. http://www.duenorth.net/temagamiriverside. When we were there there were a lot of blueberries.  So yes  some bears around.  And as I mentioned at night where the Temagami river came into the lake is where we caught fish.  Good luck."
708441,fishinfool,2012-06-23 00:09:00,366,"Thanks to all of you for your comments. I will definitely be trying the night bite with live minnows. I thought I might try a couple of the deep holes for Lake Trout too. Has anyone ever done the Lake Trout thing? At least if I can't get on the eyes, there are plenty of Pike, or so i've heard. lol  Thanks again guys.  TJ - I sent you a pm with my E-Mail address, if you have time please send me that map.   Stan"
