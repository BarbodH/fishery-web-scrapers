703847,mirogak,2012-06-08 11:08:00,387, Lol ... Shouldn't have attached that pic.
703853,Billy Bob,2012-06-08 11:54:00,5865, So you're wishing and not fishing.....
704107,young_one,2012-06-09 04:26:00,620,How did it go? It was sure windy as hell on Simcoe
704113,mirogak,2012-06-09 05:22:00,387," It was a bummer.  I was all set to go and thought I'd give the engine a start just to be sure and not give myself a surprise once I hit water. Lesson learned from a previous time. It started beautifully, let it run for 2 minutes BUT then she won't turn off. I even pulled the key out, she won't turn off. I yanked the wires from the batteries but she won't turn off. I finally had to cut off the gas supply and even then the engine took a good 3 minutes before dying out.  No idea what the hell happened to her. Tried again but same thing  Am thinking its the ignition switch or some wiring has gone loose.  So I mowed the lawn, watered the plants, cleaned the shed, thinking I'd save the day by hitting a creek nearby for some evening dry fly action but only to have the freaking monsoon pour down on me.  So in the end I gave up, cooked some dinner and just finished watching the movie ""the help""  Lol  There is my Friday report. Miro"
704114,mirogak,2012-06-09 05:23:00,387,And thx for asking
708879,mirogak,2012-06-25 01:59:00,387,"Thought I close this thread.  Rice lake was pretty good fishing, especially after 8pm.  I had always heard about the fishing getting turned on  at the flick of a switch.  And that's precisely what happened on Rice Lake especially around the islands.  They came to the surface and were splashing left and and right.  I never knew walleyes fought so hard. In the summer time, they seem lazy and don't wanna fight.  But this day, there were fighting hard.  Loads of fun.  Here is a small clip.  http://youtu.be/-Bo5-vQMJWw?hd=1"
708889,Musky or Specks,2012-06-25 02:45:00,2710,Good for you. Other than they are fish I thought you were describing me in the summer.
703702,mirogak,2012-06-07 20:30:00,387,"Hey gang,  Wanted to take the boat out for the first time this year for some walleye fishing.  Those of you who have already done so which lakes did you have more success with Scugog, Rice or Balsam?  Historically I have been skunked by Balsam many times.  Thx, M"
703703,mirogak,2012-06-07 20:31:00,387,Apologies for the typo in the subject line.

703725,ecmilley,2012-06-07 21:23:00,2163,x3 rice
703735,Dutch,2012-06-07 21:50:00,831,Rice is absolutely on fire. Fish from the mouth of the Ottonabe to the island south east with pretty much anything and you will get them.
703737,Roy,2012-06-07 21:59:00,13728,"Looks like Rice is the winner but if I were you and had a new boat and had always been skunked on Balsam, I'd go there and give ball some hell."
703750,mirogak,2012-06-07 22:20:00,387,Lol. Okay thx gents. Rice it is then. I am planning to be on the lake the entire day but I think it goes without saying that dusk and dawn are probably my best bet.
703751,Roy,2012-06-07 22:24:00,13728,Darker times are definitely better. A slight chop doesn't hurt either. Don't forget the camera.
703753,mirogak,2012-06-07 22:35:00,387,Lol Roy. Did u check out my noat's hull reg #'s.
703758,Roy,2012-06-07 22:47:00,13728," No, do they contain a secret code?"
703777,Dutch,2012-06-08 00:03:00,831," Honestly, if they are still on, you will only need about 2-3 hours to get a limit of slot fish."
703789,esoxansteel,2012-06-08 01:21:00,1307,  faster then that if you fish in the dark with an 8wt fly rod and streamers over the tops of weeds.

703817,hooked!,2012-06-08 03:21:00,38,Was on Rice tonight for a few hours after work with a buddy.  We caught 8 walleye - 7 of them were in the slot.  We also caught two crappie and 3 OOS largemouth.  All fish were caught on bucktail jigs.
703818,Stoty,2012-06-08 03:23:00,2910," Not entirely true... the past two weekends, my best times have been in the middle of the afternoon with bluebird skies and water like glass."

703820,mirogak,2012-06-08 03:31:00,387, Are you serious about streamers and walleyes? I was thinking about taking my fly rod with me?
703821,mirogak,2012-06-08 03:33:00,387, Saweeeeet ... Thx bud. Gives me reason to be on water the entire day.
703823,mirogak,2012-06-08 03:36:00,387,"Oh My God!!!!! Who hacked my account and fixed the typo in the subject line. I had misspelled ""walley"""

703827,Sinker,2012-06-08 03:52:00,8692,"Best action for me has been mid day on rice as well. As long as there is a bit of a chop, they will bite all day long in there. Choose your weapon, and find a weed edge, and you'll find some fish in there.  S."
703837,206,2012-06-08 05:08:00,563,"I'll be out for a few hours in the morn as well. Oh wait, it is morn already....better hit the hay 6:30 comes fast.
