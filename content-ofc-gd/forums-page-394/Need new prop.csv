708499,pacman,2012-06-23 13:15:00,6,"If you are in the Grey Bruce area and you are looking for a repair Bill Morrison who owns Morrison's Marina fixes them. Does a good job and is very fair and a good dude. As to your question about going to a four blade it depends what you are looking to achieve, typically you will get a better hole shot but lose a bit at WOT in saying that if you are going to stainless from aluminum you might gain all around (in my experience). That being said another ding will be more painful with stainless $$$ so if your not looking to tweak performance and in the G/B area I'd see Bill with a few twenties and you will be back in business."
708501,jedimaster,2012-06-23 13:52:00,3472,Do you have a reason to switch to a new one?When you have your boat running good its usually because you have the right prop. If all is well I say get it fixed or get the same one.
708504,strik,2012-06-23 14:20:00,175,stayed with the  same  and had the old one fixed  for a back up    i kinda figured  everything was working well so stick with the same   just try to advoid the rocks next time      thanks
