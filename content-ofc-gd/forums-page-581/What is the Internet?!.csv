546096,Terry,2011-01-31 23:42:00,14456,1994 ...and they didn't know what the internet was...  man I am trying to remember my internet timeline  I started on billboards and moved to compuserve which I think was really the start if the internet in Canada...if I remember right it was in Montreal... thank goodness for dialing programs and hacker kits.... the long distant phone calls could add up otherwise....  but I am sure that was before the 1990s ... 	it was dos.....on the puters........
546101,Joey,2011-01-31 23:49:00,9122,"We got it at the office in 1995 and there was barely anything on it at that time, and it took forever to look something up."

546118,Old Man,2011-02-01 00:20:00,822,"Bulletin Boards Systems were around starting in the late 70's and hit their peak in the mid 80's. CompuServe, while being in business since 1969, started to offer Internet connectivity as early as 1989. We all use the internet so much for everything today, that it's hard to imagine living with out it. I guess every generations feels like this. For my great grandparents it would be the telephone; my grandparents the radio;my parents TV, and for myself computers and the internet."
546122,Leecher,2011-02-01 00:37:00,7832," Yep you got that right Terry.... good old MSDOS.... Back then, I use to write some great batch file for clients so that they can launch their favorite applications  Wow how time has changed.... it's all about the GUI now"
546152,Muskieman,2011-02-01 01:46:00,2472,"When I was 13, I got a Commodore Vic-20 for Christmas and then upgraded to a Commodore 64.. I enrolled onto something .. well It wasn't a website.. since there was no Web back then. and no OFC.. it was called Quantum Link (Q-Link).. a place where you could chat ... look at some pixelated pictures and order stuff... download games and share files.  Pretty cool Eh? for the mid 80's.   Well.. I used to have a ""butterfly lock"" on my bedroom door... seems to keep every 13yr old safe ... my son has one.           Anyways...  after about a months use of Q-Link... I was sitting at the 64 with a friend playing World Games... WOW what a game that was!!   <a href=""http://s183.photobucket.com/albums/x268/suran_photos/?action=view&current=WorldGames_D3_Animation.gif"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://i183.photobucket.com/albums/x268/suran_photos/WorldGames_D3_Animation.gif"" border=""0"" alt=""Photobucket""></a>    The door to my room burst open , sending the ""butterfly lock"" onto Pat's cheek cutting him pretty good...It sent Pat running for a Band-Aid and a Kleenex..  It was my MOM Armed with a pair of Wiltshire Staysharp Scissors... waving a 750.00$ Bell Phone Bill in my face .. she was screaming profanities in French ....  Mom tore the keyboard from my desk and cut the phone lines to my modem.  (modems on the 64 were plugged into it's   )  Turns out that I was calling L.A. California 4 times a week for a month ... Hmmm  .   The following month we got another for about 400.00$....  needless to say that Q-Link was no more.   Now, my Son, Tyler   is 13 ... he has the Net in his room with all the bells and whistles $$$.. under conditions that I get full access to his 'puter and that he never makes a 750.00 bill appear in the mail box..   We've come a long way.. since the mid 80's   ... now I'm kinda scared to think what the NET will be like in another 25yrs..   But without it's advent we all wouldn't be here discussing it ..    I think that T.J coined this one ""Y'a can't go fishing without the NET""   The posted video is a reminder on how ""We knew it all"" then... my 8 year old is more advance now than Katie Couric was then... ya gotta wonder how the next generation will turn out Eh?
