547033,cityfisher,2011-02-02 20:02:00,959," It is open from what i was told(not 100 sure), its more of a softwater fishery and there isn't much action but im sure you could catch some Pike with some nice big minnows, maybe even a walleye that made it over from Baptiste.  Let us know how it goes as I always thought to give it a try during the winter."

If your up in that neck of the woods, you have literraly thousands of better options than elephant though. i wouldn't waste my time there when there are trout lakes all over!! Specks, splake, lakers, and bows are a lot more fun than small pike IMO.   S."
