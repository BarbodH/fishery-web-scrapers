546249,ckrb2007,2011-02-01 05:25:00,449,What species are you wanting to target?
546785,ozaibak1,2011-02-02 05:40:00,401,"Assuming you're targeting perch / pike, I would recommend either Dave's Fish Huts or IceFishingOutfitters out of Virginia Beach, Lake Simcoe. I've fished a fair amount at each and they're both equally as good, I can't recommend one over the other I like them both. pm me if you're interested in more details about them, and good luck!"
