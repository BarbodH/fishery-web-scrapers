546148,scugpg,2011-02-01 01:25:00,1373,I recently bought some duracast ice line to try out. Works great except for one issue.....for some reason it shows up on the sonar really bad. Tried turning down the sens. to the point I couldn't see my jig anymore and could still see it. Had a buddy that has a vex try my setup and even on the vex it was showing up. http://www.tuf-line.com/products_Ice-Fishing-Lines_21.html  Any one else notice some lines aren't sonar friendly?

You'll probably also get a lot of people telling you they like PP, Rapala braid for ice too. I really dislike the ice you get on the line though. For me, unless I'm fishing more than 70FOW, I will not use braid.  I thought Duracast was terrible when I got a spool of the softwater stuff. 24lb test braid equaled 12lb mono. The line numbers on your link looks better, but I don't recall how much."
