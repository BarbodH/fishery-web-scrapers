546480,Fisherman,2011-02-01 21:43:00,7201,"Hmmm, all I see is some nimblenut roaring around, wasting gas and trying to break something.  One minute with a good sawzall blade and you can do it right.  And they probably let him vote and breed too."
546593,misfish,2011-02-01 23:58:00,29133,"What ya mean wasting gas,he,s proving a point,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,LOL  Get back in yer Otter an catch more pan fish."
546604,fish_fishburn,2011-02-02 00:27:00,1311,He's proving to all how big of an idiot he is.
546607,mercman,2011-02-02 00:36:00,7054,I`ll say !!! That cant be good for the bottom or the fish habitat either.
546608,Fisherman,2011-02-02 00:37:00,7201,"Now if he really wanted to prove how strong they were, the anchor sticks should have held their ground and ripped the transom right off the back of the boat,  then he would have made two points, the anchor sticks are strong and yes, he's an idiot for trying.  Now back to panfishing"
546627,misfish,2011-02-02 01:12:00,29133,"Ok he did abit of over board,but he did prove they are tough and strong. Did you hear how that motor  dropped hp?  Hey Erich,you might one for the new machine.You could you it as a fish finder. STOP HERE.LOL"

546682,mbac31,2011-02-02 02:30:00,904,"  Can you imagine that video, that ould be hilarious for sure. I just ordered my Talons from Minnkota Brian so I hope they are what they say they are or it will be the Power Pole. We shall see."
546763,mukluk,2011-02-02 04:14:00,196,Just wondering how many duck and loon eggs got wasted; as well as silting the bass nests .  Awesome anchor sticks!
546774,thebigcatch,2011-02-02 04:44:00,138,I'm getin them oh my nitro in may I'll let you know how they work !!!!
546778,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-02-02 04:55:00,0,I'm glad meatheads like this own a boat i've only dreamed of to this point.
547097,misfish,2011-02-02 22:55:00,29133,"  You might be on the wrong site,,,,,,,,,I believe P3TA is around the corner just down aways."
547098,misfish,2011-02-02 22:55:00,29133," As for you,yer hot and cold."
547100,misfish,2011-02-02 22:57:00,29133," Thanks,looking forward to your report. I seen some on some bass boats here at the launch and talked to the owners how they worked. Positive so far."
547101,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-02-02 22:58:00,0, better than being cold all the time.
547102,misfish,2011-02-02 22:59:00,29133," Cool, let me know yer thoughts on them?"
547133,aplumma,2011-02-03 00:33:00,6896, I am pretty sure that no loons were harmed in this video...he lives in Florida.    Take this for what it is...it answers the question of how fragile are the sticks and if the hydraulic rams are strong enough to survive the one stupid thing we all will do and thats forget to raise the rams before taking off. I would after viewing the video buy this anchor system if I fished a style that it would be beneficial.   Art
