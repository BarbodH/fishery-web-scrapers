Clifford Wise of Eagle River was convicted under the Fish and Wildlife Conservation Act and charged $1,500 for unlawfully selling moose antlers and $600 for providing false information to a Ministry of Natural Resources conservation officer.  Court heard that during the fall of 2008, Wise was acting as a hunting guide for a Wisconsin hunter who shot and wounded a bull moose that got away from them. Wise found the carcass two weeks later and removed and took home the antlers. He later offered to sell the antlers for $500 US. In the fall of 2009, Wise sold the antlers to a plainclothes conservation officer in Vermilion Bay.  The case was heard August 12 and November 16, and the verdict handed down in the Ontario Court of Justice, Dryden, on January 25."
