546443,TDunn,2011-02-01 20:39:00,680,"Was out for a day of brookie fishing about a week and a half ago. Hit a lake north of the Soo by snowmobile. Biggest was a little over 20"" and skinny...smaller fish were still a decent 16"".  20""   18""   Since then Iv have just been sneaking out to some panfish and pike territory.  Lake Superior....Deep basin perch     Lake George... Weedbeds heating up!     St. Marys River   Steadily hitting pike on the tip-pups. This next month should heat up and the big girls should start to steadily roll in. Ive only seen one 36-40"" fish hooked so far this season, only to be lost in the hole....      Even stopped by the locks one afternoon for some downtown whitie action!    I hope to report back next with some nice pike results....Maybe even a trip to LSPP!  TDunn"
