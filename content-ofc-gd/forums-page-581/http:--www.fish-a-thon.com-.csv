537453,skinny,2011-01-10 16:08:00,442,it was a great time out there for sure. I need to figure out what I'm going to use for a boat this year sold off the 14ft I had so now just the 16 and my electric troling motor just doesn't seem to cut it on that boat for some reason. Just might have to find me antother small boat or better trolling equipment

537703,GBW,2011-01-11 00:55:00,8460,"hey guys, I read my name on the site, thanks but it's not needed to have me as a sponsor. however, if I win the current contest from TJ and Dave, I will donate the $200 gift from Dave to the event (I may take a lure or two though, LOL). If I win from TJ, forget it, I want an OFC summer and winter hat.  The rest can go to the event (if there is anything left   ) Cheers and I hope the site get's a lot of hit's and can raise some cash at the same time.  Cheers. Geoff"
