546687,MCTFisher9120,2011-02-02 02:40:00,3761,"This isn't my motor, just came across the motor. Just wondered why such a fine running motor blew like that :S"
546689,Old Man,2011-02-02 02:43:00,822, Low oil or faulty oil pressure sensor.
546734,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-02-02 03:37:00,0,owner negligence.

546408,skeeter,2011-02-01 19:48:00,1907,lack of oil?
546410,TDunn,2011-02-01 19:51:00,680,thats what I thought....not much of a mechanic here tho...   TDunn
546411,aplumma,2011-02-01 19:52:00,6896,Red light and a buzzer should be in the manual as to the cause.  Art
546413,bubbles,2011-02-01 19:53:00,591,My vote is for lack of oil
546418,HTHM,2011-02-01 20:00:00,4082,I hope that was not your motor.
546420,mercman,2011-02-01 20:04:00,7054,judging by the smoke-steam piston ring failure
546424,Old Man,2011-02-01 20:11:00,822,"According to my manual, a 6 second continuous beep indicates low oil pressure. Most likely caused by low oil level.  Cooling system problem such as low water pressure or engine over heating is 6 seconds of intermittent beeps.  So it sounds like an oil pressure problem."
546426,Calender Don,2011-02-01 20:14:00,39,Either low oil or water pressure. My four stroke has the light too. I would start by looking at the oil.
546432,jimmer,2011-02-01 20:23:00,2730,Lack of Oil or water. Never a good sound. Probably all the rings are gone and major work needed.
546436,DanD,2011-02-01 20:28:00,2223,"With that amount of smoke that (too me) looks more like steam; could be the thermostat stuck closed or the impeller wiped out of it and the motor is overheating? Didnt hear any knocking and it did crank & restart on the few attempts that were shown in the video. Lack of oil and that much smoke; I dont know if it would turn over, let alone restart?  Dan.  Just watched the vid again and the tell tail spit hole has water coming out of it so the impeller is OK; maybe just a stuck thermostat; if this particular motor has one?"
546448,Shaun Rickard,2011-02-01 20:49:00,144," Not sure if the same would apply on a 25, but I had a very similar issue with my 200, it turned out to be a faulty sending module, it was telling the engine there was no oil when there was. The part cost me $25... and then about $100 in labour lol!  Good luck mate, i hope it isn't anything serious."
546452,Old Man,2011-02-01 20:54:00,822," The Engine Guardian System will shut down the motor if it detects a critical engine condition, so it stands to reason that it also could be a faulty sensor. One way or the other the motor either has or thinks it has a low oil pressure situation."
546470,lookinforwalleye,2011-02-01 21:27:00,4399,Why with all that smoke would you try and restart!
546474,fishermccann,2011-02-01 21:34:00,655,
546508,steelhedrmatt,2011-02-01 22:17:00,278,"I just traded the same motor in for the exact same reason. maybe 30 - 40 hours on it.  Had it in to be fixed 3 times to no avail. computer says oils sensor.  had it changed twice only to have the same prob.  Upgraded to a evinrude e-tec 40, and never been happier.  Those mercs are crap.  Made in China, Assembled in Mexico."
546532,Billy Bob,2011-02-01 22:47:00,5865,"Huh, and my 1985 Johnson ""VRO"" 50 hp is still going strong after many here said the VRO system is junk........go figure....  BTW...that was taken in the summer as the trees have leaves on them...  Bottom line, get something other then a Merc...."
546542,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-02-01 22:55:00,0,Mercs aren't what they used to be. Buy a yammie!
546613,Fisherman,2011-02-02 00:41:00,7201," Ah, go stick a prop on the back of yer Yota, throw a quart of Seafoam in the tank and then ya can join the outboard race  And BTW, I put up the snow defence shield, it's all blowing back to NY."
546617,BillM,2011-02-02 00:53:00,17367,"I like how he just keeps starting it and starting it, lol.  The light is on for a reason, figure out why it's on before you caused even more damage."
546645,mercman,2011-02-02 01:46:00,7054,opinions are a dime a dozen.  Facts are priceless. http://www.marineeng...e-outboards.htm  40 60 90 hp models are co designed with yamaha.
546661,vinnimon,2011-02-02 02:00:00,2593,"OIL issue, shes peeing like a race horse."
546671,Old Man,2011-02-02 02:16:00,822,  :good:
546674,mercman,2011-02-02 02:24:00,7054,"  guess ya can tell, i like Mercs. Fact is, most components of all the other makes are all made in China anyways. Even if the motor wasnt made there, it may as wel have been, with all the chinese components in em."
546684,Old Man,2011-02-02 02:35:00,822," My 2007 60HP has been great so far. Living on a lake, I put a lot hours on it and I have no complaints."
