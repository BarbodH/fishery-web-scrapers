Thats been my experiences anyway. Ive had my fair share of beer out on the ice and have never been ticketed or warned for that matter. Politeness and Responsibility goes a long way!
546688,mike rousseau,2011-02-02 02:40:00,4661,I emailed the O.P.P. Myself on the topic... And no... You can't drink in your ice shack
546752,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-02-02 03:55:00,0," The MNR isn't always right you know!  If you want to know the answer, ask a judge or lawyer.  This past weekend, they threatened to charge a man on a nearby lake for sitting in his camp with a tipup out front.  Apparently the CO needed to be reminded of the language of the law which states:  ""Two lines may be used for ice fishing except in a limited number of waters (see the exceptions for the Zone in which you are fishing). You must be within 60 m (197 ft.) at all times of any line or tip-up you are using when ice fishing and you must have a clear and unobstructed view of the lines being used at all times.""  This means that you are fully entitled to sit in your warm camp as long as you can see your line clearly and it's not beyond the specified distance.  It's just an example, but it goes to show how they add their own overzealous spin to the legislation."

546754,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-02-02 03:58:00,0,"Carry the regs, and ask for the specific legislation they are issuing a fine based on.  Some of them are as full of misconceptions as some anglers."
544432,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-01-27 23:56:00,0, and i'd say that would make you a responsible angler. here in ontario however having one of those beers could land you a 100-something dollar fine. my uncle has received a fine 2 summers in a row for having ONE beer in the boat.  he's not a drinker at all but took a single beer in the boat for his evening troll.  it's despicable!
544443,Fisherman,2011-01-28 00:16:00,7201,In other words he's not a fast learner eh..
544447,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-01-28 00:19:00,0,"   well, he is a steelworker!  have you ever brought a beer in YOUR boat?"
544485,smally21,2011-01-28 01:16:00,993,"how about this one - EMPTY beers in the boat?  cop says do you have any alcohol on board.  boater - no  cop searches finds 4 empty beer cans in the livewell.  cop - you said you didn't have alcohol?  boater - i dont have alcohol i have garbage. there is an empty tim hortons cup right there, if you asked if i had any coffee i would also say no.  so the cop wants to pursue the issue, so the explanation is we were in our residence (campsite) and drank these beers legally.  we are now responsibly returning our garbage on the way out, as it would be illegal to leave it.  the issue im raising is the transportation of empty liquor containers can be an issue as well. once a year we clean out the island of empties. im talking a bargeload, hundreds of cases of bottles and bags of cans. its about the only money the lodge makes!  so if a cop pulls the barge over and discovers 50000 beer bottles are we in violation of the law?  im talking two guys on a 38foot barge so loaded with bottles you cant see over the top!  the answer is yes, if you can get grilled over EMPTIES in your bassboat, and of course you're not loaded.  but here common sense rules out, beers have to get to island properties and empties have to come back.  well the opp officer found out who the group was and 'let us off with a warning'.  translation - too hard to prosecute empties without prooof of consumption.  just something to chew on. you'd would have liked the look on his face when the tim horton comment was made...."

544512,Guest gbfisher,2011-01-28 02:20:00,0, It's called water... Water on the water Beer over here.  The registration for your hut is the reason behind being on crown land.  Ya need to do some reading Mr Fisherman.
544514,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-01-28 02:21:00,0,"Hear, hear!"
544515,mercman,2011-01-28 02:23:00,7054,I can understand not having beer in a boat.Its like drinking and driving.But in an ice hut  What the heck is that all about. Such an uptight little community.
544520,Fisherman,2011-01-28 02:33:00,7201," The registration for your hut is the reason behind being on crown land.   The last time I checked, you registered permanent huts so that the MNR knew who the owner was in case of it being left after the ""hut off the ice"" date, nothing to do with crown land.  That's why you don't have to register the smaller portable huts, people take them home at night so they are not left to be trashed or burned down like the big ones."
544522,Guest gbfisher,2011-01-28 02:37:00,0, I meant to add that your INS and registration for your ATV or snowmachine is to ride on crown land as well. That would include frozen lakes.

544559,brkygetr,2011-01-28 03:48:00,425,didn't read past the first page of posts... but... its illegal unless you got a bed and a crapper. Drink water or near beer.
544562,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-01-28 03:53:00,0,i'll drink to that.
544569,Dara,2011-01-28 04:05:00,3052,"Seems to me we have a lot of rules and different interpretations.  So just why is it illegal to drink a beer while fishing, lets say, in a hut. There are laws against being drunk in a public lace. there are laws against drunk driving. So why is there a law against drinking at all. What do they think we are...little kids. As long as you don't disturb others or drive impaired, whats the problem.   And why don't the cops issue a release officially stating the rules on ice huts. Are they scared we might not kiss their butts when they come to interogate us.  Its not like there is a G20 summit out on the ice"
544576,ctdd2006,2011-01-28 04:34:00,531," ... but they sorta did on our local news this week, but the terms used were ""some sort of permanency!""  Very vague and quite obvious nobody still knows the true law????  Very grey!.  I'll continue to ""sip"" in my hut and deal with the consequences....doesn't mean I'll ever operate anything impaired!  It's all Bull.  spell it out once and for all and we'll react accordingly."
544579,fishing n autograph,2011-01-28 04:46:00,2540,"Because most who drink do stupid things including driving atvs or snowmobiles drunk... People on this board may have self control and common sense, but there are MANY people out there who aren't  Alcohol makes people do really stupid things and from what I see day in and day out there are a lot of good people who become absolute idiots when they drink"

544582,Jonny,2011-01-28 05:00:00,1380,"I'd just like to add that if you have a vehicle or a sled parked next to your hut, it seems to me you'd better pull the ignition key while fishing.  Depending on ""officer discretion"" if you've had a couple you might get slapped with a vehicular offense, and that means losing your driver's license and all the other nasty stuff."
544588,cram,2011-01-28 05:25:00,1733," ""most"" who drink, drink and drive?  Is that honestly how you see the world?"

Surely you must know collegues who enjoy a drink or two...perhaps you do yourself.  I know I do...but that doesn't mean that any of us drink and drive."

544276,skeeter,2011-01-27 17:04:00,1907,"Yes it is illegal. Most likely you'll be asked to dump your booze instead of getting a ticket, it all depends on the officer and your attitude. Personally, I have never been more than 20 feet out on the ice so I don't really interact with the guys on simcoe so I don't really know what goes on. If I see a beer or two I'm not going to get bent out of shape but if I see a dozen crushed empties and a 2-4 in the corner then we'd have issues  I agree with you 100% ! It's called moderation. "
544277,DRIFTER_016,2011-01-27 17:08:00,10439,"  HMMMMMM, so you're advocating drinking and snowmobiling eh? Drinks are usually slushies by the time I get to where I'm going to fish. Only way to get them down before that is to drink them before leaving the house or while riding to my destination. Drinking and snowmobiling is against the law, but you wouldn't know it."
544279,fishing n autograph,2011-01-27 17:16:00,2540," There's been a debate about that for the last few years.....  LLA states that in order for it to be a private place or residence it has to have a toilet, kitchen and sleeping quarters like on an anchored cabin cruiser. However, in a camp ground, case law has stated that a camp site that you've purchase is a private place....like a hotel room. So, now some are considering a rented ice hut as a private place, however, some aren't...it's one of the grey areas in Provincial Laws"
544280,Terry,2011-01-27 17:17:00,14456,"as said depends of what officer of the law you get, decides your fate now I can't prove it but I think before they go out on duty each day they spin a big roulette wheel to see what way they want to read the laws   spppppinnnnnnn click click click click.we have a winner .....today no drinking in huts but you can use perch parts as bait...tomorrow..wellwe will not know till they spin the wheel again"

544285,smally21,2011-01-27 17:25:00,993,"ok, i think the description of residence is agreed upon.  it is legal to drink beer in a campsite upon crown land. that one has always stumped me. so i cant drink in the boat, or on the ice, or just about anywhere else. but i stop my canoe for the night at a campsite on lake temagami, and its ok to pound back 100 beers, provided i clean them up. go figure. as much as the def'n of residence is pretty clear, how can we explain the press releases that state clearly that the ice hut is ok? tough to keep up with the law on either side of enforcement if you ask me.  hey billy bob, enjoy that ice cold beer.  sometimes (SOMETIMES) its the united states of common sense."
544291,Terry,2011-01-27 17:40:00,14456,"if the place occupied and used as a dwelling is a tent, includes the land immediately adjacent to and used in conjunction with the tent    just remember when you are on the ice/water there is no adjacent land"

544304,smally21,2011-01-27 17:59:00,993,"is that the 3rd or 4th def'n of residence - just in this thread alone!  a citizens due diligence is to make themselves aware of the law and operate within it.  a peace officers job is to enforce the law.  the reason the lawbooks are long and onerous is to remove the doubt left by less wordy descriptions.  making it easy for joe public to behave lawfully and joe officer to do his job by letter of law as opposed to using his/her interpretation of it.  when different agencies view/interpret legislate law at their descretion joe public is left at their mercy.  while there will never be a replacement of the ""good judgement"" of the investigating officer that person should not be left to decide or interpret the law.  the whole idea is to remove the idea that the officer could have applied any bias as to who the party was they were investigating - both for the protection of the officer and the public.  interesting to see that the opp releases their take on a common question asked by the public, and their own officers and local agencies take it upon themselves to act against this clarification.  oh well - HIDE YOUR BEERS THE MAN'S COMIN!!!  you can insert POLICE DISCRETION where i put good judgement.  they have pretty much the identical meaning here."

544319,Guest gbfisher,2011-01-27 18:17:00,0,Although I don't drink myself as far as I know you can't drink in a public place. The ice on the lake makes it crown land. I know that anytime I have ever fished with police they themselves drank on the water. In boats and on the ice. There was no concern with it what so ever. Take your chances and deal with the consequenses if that is what you have to do while out fishing for the day.

544396,aplumma,2011-01-27 21:43:00,6896,I would apply the same rules as summer boating...use a coozie on your beer can. Place all empties back in the cooler and carry no more than 3 beers per personal cooler.   Art

544121,irishfield,2011-01-27 04:20:00,26272,"Illegal.. unless it's a full living quarter bungaloo with full head etc. Technically even the Nip bungalo's aren't legal as the head is outside.. but since it's a rental they consider it your ""residence"".. like a campsite. Basic hut.. illegal"
544122,Gerritt,2011-01-27 04:23:00,6129,It needs to be considered a residence.. meaning an attached bathroom.. most homemade huts do not have one.. rentals don't either... but because you're paying they take it in to consideration..  very much the rules as a boat.   edited to add.. as Wayne stated while I was doing my post.
544123,cram,2011-01-27 04:29:00,1733,"Okay - has enforcement of this picked up recently, or have I just been lucky?  Never had an issue...though not on super busy lakes either."

544127,irishfield,2011-01-27 04:34:00,26272, Print that one out and keep it in your hut... better yet find the official press release if there is one. Georgian Bay OPP go hut to hut and lay Liquor other than residence charges every winter.

But yes if you are falling down drunk, act like a jerk when checked, or are blatantly disrespecting the law.. (ie.. open alcohol while tending you're lines) then you can expect a ticket..  most officers are decent about this. However, there is an exception to the rule.....

544131,cram,2011-01-27 04:39:00,1733,I understand if people are being yahoos and disturbing others or endangering themselves.....but going hut to hut to lay tickets seems pretty overboard to me.  Especially for huts where you stay overnight.
544132,irishfield,2011-01-27 04:40:00,26272," sounds like an OFC get together at Hooters..  Sharp hooks.. sharp power augers.. sleds.. towing portable huts.. questionable ice or machine breakdowns.. we wait 'till we come in off the ice! Would probably be a different tune I'm sure if we were all 20 years younger, but we've been there done that and wonder how we're still all here!"
544133,cram,2011-01-27 04:41:00,1733," This has been my experience as well -- have often had police drop by while i'm fishing (including last year) and didn't seem to care that i had a beer.  Good chat about the lake/ice/etc and they went on their way.  Nice guys just checking in. Someone told me its been a big deal this year (hut to hut, like Wayne said)...as though it changed."
544134,cram,2011-01-27 04:44:00,1733, Didn't mean smashed.....i don't want to carry that much beer with me anyway (too heavy).  But 3-4 over an afternoon isn't going to hurt me (or others).
544135,Fishnwire,2011-01-27 04:46:00,983,"Depends on who you talk to.  This discussion was on another board and various posters had differing opinions on this which they based on their on experience and/or what they heard first hand from COs or police officers.  Guys went to the trouble of asking this specific question and the ""authorities"" gave different guys different answers.  Some people were told that open liquior is allowed inside the hut and within its immediate vicinity.  They were also told the hut doesn't require sleeping or cooking facilities, nor does it require a bathroom.  Another guy (who had all those things and was charged anyway) was told by the cop that none of that applied to a hut...only a boat.  There were various stories of cops and COs displaying a wide range of leaniance (or lack there of) so it would seem that sadly, the only way you can be sure of not having problems it to leave the high-test at home.  One guy posted this...  ""Thank you for your enquiry.  MNR Conservation Officers are appointed under the Liquor Licence Act (LLA) and can enforce its provisions and regulations. Similar to the Off-Road Vehicles Act and The Motorized Snow Vehicles Act the LLA is not necessarily considered to be a mandated piece of MNR legislation however they all can be and are from time to time enforced by Conservation Officers, particularly in instances where public safety is at issue.  Ice huts and tents located on Crown land, at this point in time are accepted by MNR as being a ""private place"" as defined in LLA Regulation 718. Therefore it is MNR's interpretation that alcohol may be legally consumed within them. While there remain some grey areas in respect to portable ice huts meeting the definition of a ""private place"", once again the primary decision of a Conservation Officer to enforce the LLA in any situation will be related to the safety of the individuals involved and to the public in general.  If you have any further questions, please contact the Natural Resources Information Centre at 1-800-667-1940.  Regards,  nric web reader - gh ******************************************* Natural Resources Information Centre""  But another guy posted this...  ""Reference: Liquor Licence Act. Section 31, 32 Criminal Code of Canada Section 253  The law enforcement agencies in Ontario that enforce the legislation that governs the consumption of alcohol (Liquor Licence Act, Criminal Code of Canada) consider an ice shack to be a residence only when it is equipped with cooking, sleeping and washroom facilities. Alcohol may be consumed inside the shack and in the area immediately adjacent to the building. Most importantly however, the persons consuming alcohol must plan on staying and actually stay overnight. If the ice shack is not being used as a residence but merely as a temporary day shelter, or if it doesn’t meet the criteria of a residence then charges could be laid.""   ---  A poster eventually said he just got off the phone with the OPP and was told it would basically depend on the officer and what kind of mood he was in that day.  How do you like that?  I guess it could also depend on whether you were dealing with a CO or actual cop."

544142,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-01-27 04:58:00,0,"i've seen people get charged for having one beer in their lunchbag for a day of fishing.  it's totally ridiculous and insulting that instead of chasing poachers, they harass anglers."
544147,dhickey,2011-01-27 05:10:00,1038, no toilet  no  booz.  thats the standard rule.   singed  new guy .don h.
544157,misfish,2011-01-27 11:46:00,29133,"In most cases,they will not charge you here if you are well mannerd and not out of hand. They will however ream yer   if your not.  I with Doc,but also with Wayne on this.Chase the real perps,and wait til yer off,and yes been there done it many times years ago."
544160,mercman,2011-01-27 12:01:00,7054,"  welcome to the ratrace Don  !!Jump right in,,,the waters fine"
544174,fishing n autograph,2011-01-27 13:03:00,2540,"Yes it is illegal. Most likely you'll be asked to dump your booze instead of getting a ticket, it all depends on the officer and your attitude. Personally, I have never been more than 20 feet out on the ice so I don't really interact with the guys on simcoe so I don't really know what goes on. If I see a beer or two I'm not going to get bent out of shape but if I see a dozen crushed empties and a 2-4 in the corner then we'd have issues"
544176,canadadude,2011-01-27 13:07:00,769,"On lake Nipissing we were never bothered for liquor in or around the hut, however the OPP set up a R.I.D.E check point right off the landing every Saturday afternoon till around 8:00pm. They also never failed to nail at least 2 or 3 ice fishers, like previously said if your polite out on the ice the MNR or OPP ask a few questions and wish you a good day."
544180,skeeter,2011-01-27 13:15:00,1907,"ok so as i understand this, i have cooking facility's, and sleeping facility's in my hut, so all i need is a plastic bag in a milk crate to make it legal? ok, party time. im on my way to the store to pick up a case of root beer......  ""Would probably be a different tune I'm sure if we were all 20 years younger, but we've been there done that and wonder how we're still all here!"" Wayne i have no idea what you mean!"
544241,hockeyplayerz_14,2011-01-27 16:04:00,160,I look at it like Water on the Water and beer on the peer
544245,DRIFTER_016,2011-01-27 16:12:00,10439,"No rules about it up here in the far north that I know of, but good luck keeping it from freezing while sledding to your fishing spot. I keep drinks in a cooler with hand warmers and still have them freeze up."
544253,Sinker,2011-01-27 16:26:00,8692,"I've never seen whiskey freeze!! Beer is for the ladies. I pretty much always have my flask full of something in the ice. Not enough to get drunk, but just the right amount to keep me warm  S."
544256,cram,2011-01-27 16:31:00,1733, Think i'd rather get a ticket than have all of our beer dumped.
