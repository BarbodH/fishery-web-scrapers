546620,brkygetr,2011-02-02 01:00:00,425,Anyone heading out this weekend that wants a tag along. Went with 2 buddies last weekend after perch but all I wanted to do was head to deeper water and sit STILL and jig!!!!!! Couldn't do it as the boys were after perch and I was the taxi....if anyone is going out this weekend I am coming up with the sled and am willing to go anywhere with fish that hang out deep....oh and I WILL be riding alone this weekend!!! Send a pm if not into full frontal postings. I will be there and would be great to meet up with someone with patience...even if no fish at least we will be fishing for the right ones!  Cheers all...

Forget the perch...only fish for it when no big boys around  Cheers, Ice Fisherman"
