545963,Hoppy,2011-01-31 18:45:00,95,"Hi all,  peeps call me Hoppy, I am basically a grumpy old man. I live in Innisfil and Ice fish when I can. I use to love steelheading rivers but can't anymore because although I still have two legs I have only one knee between them. So wading has been out the last almost decade now. I find the Ice the easiest access to fishing now and look forward to the hard water each year. Hope to see you all @ the fishing for Tyler event.  Hoppy"
