546669,BillM,2011-02-02 02:13:00,17367,"Just picked up a sled and it sticks out quite a bit past the tailgate when in the back of my S10.  I've been searching the MTO site without much luck.  Is there a limitation as to how far my load can stick out past the tailgate?  I realize it will need red flags or similar, but I just want to make sure I'm legal driving down the road (with it secured in place with tie-downs obviously)"
546677,Fisherman,2011-02-02 02:26:00,7201,"Here ya go: The Highway Traffic Act states that any load overhanging the rear of a vehicle by 1.5 m (5 ft) or more should be marked by a red light when lights are required (one-half hour before sunset to one-half hour after sunrise) and, at all other times, by a red flag or red marker.  Oh ya, if your kidoo hangs over by 5 feet, I think you'll be doing a wheelie all the way to the lake in an S-10."
546686,BillM,2011-02-02 02:38:00,17367,"LOL!!!  Yeah, it's no 5ft, maybe a foot and a half at most, I appreciate the info!  One less thing to worry about.  Damn ZR2's and their shortboxes!  The interesting part is how I'm going to load this sucker, lol."
546695,Gerritt,2011-02-02 02:52:00,6129,Ramp from princess auto?
546697,skeeter,2011-02-02 02:53:00,1907,"no worries about marking it,fisherman hit it on the head. as for loading it...... you can buy a ramp/build a ramp. another limited option is to make sure you pile a snow bank high enough to load it each time. save the hassle and start looking for a single or utility trailer!"
546698,BillM,2011-02-02 02:56:00,17367," I already have access to a trailer, the problem is storing it.  No room at my place..  I'll check out the ramps at PA!   I actually off loaded it tonight into a snowbank at the front of my house.  Pulled it out, put it into reverse and off she came."
546701,irishfield,2011-02-02 03:02:00,26272,It grows old real fast though Bill... 
546703,solopaddler,2011-02-02 03:04:00,8605,Sweet you got a sled!
546724,smally21,2011-02-02 03:22:00,993,"just stay off the 407 with your tailgate down, they have no sense of humour with that."
546726,irishfield,2011-02-02 03:26:00,26272,"Brother rides the 407 all the time on his Harley.. standard config, as manufactured, storage box overhangs the plate and the camera can't pick it up. Plate is not ""obstructed"" and not his problem that camera angle can't pick it up. Same deal with a tailgate down with load in truck. Plate can still be read by the police following.. it's not ""obstructed"". There are no ""exceptions"" in the HWTA for the 407."
546735,John Bacon,2011-02-02 03:37:00,3277,GMC Jimmy's with the rear mounted spare tire are also eligible for 'discounts' on the 407.
546745,BillM,2011-02-02 03:47:00,17367, Add the Pathfinder to the list as well with the rear mounted spare
546759,DRIFTER_016,2011-02-02 04:05:00,10439,And my old Ford Bronco.
546793,misfish,2011-02-02 10:08:00,29133,Bill you can keep it in the back of my ford if yer worried about it.  No walking for you I see.
546798,12footspringbok,2011-02-02 11:40:00,459,So what did you end up buying?
546874,BillM,2011-02-02 15:04:00,17367," Older Polaris, 2000 Indy Trail Touring.  Twin 550, 2UP, reverse, etc etc.  Should be a great ice fishing machine."
546878,troutologist,2011-02-02 15:08:00,951,"Bill check out cabelas.com. I bought a yukon trifold ramp in dec, it was on sale, something like 134 shipped to my door. PAs ramps were 169.  I see some still on sale there."
546885,Roy,2011-02-02 15:16:00,13728, Ramps are on special starting Thursday at CTC.
546887,BillM,2011-02-02 15:17:00,17367, Thanks buddy!  I'll check them out.
546912,12footspringbok,2011-02-02 16:00:00,459, Great ice fishing sled. I could see where it might stick out of the back of an S10 being its a touring longtrack model LOL. I'll have to keep an eye out there for ya. If you see someone pulling up on an even older indy trail its me.
546928,BillM,2011-02-02 16:30:00,17367,"I'll keep my eye open for ya  Roy, thanks for the info!!"
546996,bdox,2011-02-02 18:28:00,329," Same with my ZR2 Blazer with big 31"" spare hanging off the back."
