Some of the crazy buggers even fished naked from the waist up on Saturday! Great prizes, great food, great activities, great guys and great times. If anyone is interested, or perhaps were there, you can see many of the pictures on our Facebook fan page: Shaun Rickard's Urban Outdoor Adventures  Cheers, Shaun"

The winner of the 'No shirt fish off' actually won a $1500 prize package for his trouble (first guy to land a fish), not bad for catching a 4oz Perch, so it was worthwhile to have goose bumps and erect nipples for a few minutes  LOL!  Cheers, Shaun"
