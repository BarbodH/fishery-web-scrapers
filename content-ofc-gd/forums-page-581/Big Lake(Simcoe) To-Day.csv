546264,Spiel,2011-02-01 12:12:00,9065,"Sheeeesh, they don't look like Lakers Rick but I'm pleased your enjoying the rod.    They're not so hard to get Jacques, I'm taking orders for next years ice season."
546268,RickOnt,2011-02-01 13:19:00,669,"Chris  No Lakers on The ""Rod"" To-day  But the season is not over!!!   Rick"

546275,Spiel,2011-02-01 13:54:00,9065,"  Just teasing you Rick, you asked for a trout rod and you're catching whities, don't get me wrong, I love whities. I'm just looking forward to the report where your new rod puts a hurt'n on some big lakers."
546278,limeyangler,2011-02-01 13:56:00,5204,"Nice big whities Rick. WTG keepin' moving till you find 'em. We had to move lots the last time out for whities too, i find its hard to drag myself off to another spot when its really cold."
546291,RickOnt,2011-02-01 14:30:00,669,Chris  I did get a Laker but I was not using the New Rod.  I will get you that Pic before the season ends.
