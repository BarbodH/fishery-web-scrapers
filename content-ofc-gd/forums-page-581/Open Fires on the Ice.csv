546035,Muskieman,2011-01-31 20:34:00,2472,"I fired off an E-Mail to the MNR regarding this topic.  My question..........  Q:  Is it legal or illegal to have a fire directly on the ice , ie:frozen waterway.. must it be contained? like in a stove or bucket or portable pit, chimmnea?  A: from E-mail Reply: Yes Hello Randy,  Thank you for your enquiry. Under the Public Lands Act;  Unauthorized filling -  27. (1) Except with the written consent of the Minister or an officer authorized by the Minister, no person shall deposit or cause to be deposited any material, substance or thing,  (a) on public lands, whether or not the lands are covered with water or ice; or  ( on water or ice covering public lands. 2010, c. 16, Sched. 10, s. 4 (2).  Having a fire on a frozen water body would leave debris and ash on the ice surface, which would be considered 'deposited material'. Therefore you can't have a fire directly on the ice of a lake or river. You may have a fire in a barrel or other contained vessel as long as it's removed after use and leaves no trace behind.  We hope you find this information helpful. If you require further assistance, please contact the Natural Resources Information Centre at 1-800-667-1940.

546058,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-01-31 21:33:00,0,good to know!  thanks for sharing!
546059,Fishnwire,2011-01-31 21:43:00,983,"I could be wrong, but the way I read that...you can't have a fire on the shore either.  -  Isn't it basically saying you can't leave debris (from a fire) on land or ice?  Does that mean every camp fire I've ever lit has been illegal?"
546064,Muskieman,2011-01-31 21:53:00,2472,  I re-read it as well...  You seem to be right.. No stone circles.. Hmmmm.. time for another E-mail  Randy 
546088,steverowbotham,2011-01-31 23:27:00,1800, LOL
546098,Jonny,2011-01-31 23:45:00,1380,"You could be fined for building a duck blind, building a tree stand for big game hunting, a few other things too, I guess, that guys regularly do.  ""I'd like to hunt that tree stand.""  ""Well sorry, you can't. I built it and I'm using it.""  Out comes the badge.  Ever get the feeling that no matter what you're doing and how legal you think you are, they'll always find something they can nail you with if they want to?"
546162,Muskieman,2011-02-01 02:07:00,2472," Right again, no matter how precocious one is ... It can all come back to bite you in the   ... ya gotta wonder sometimes.  Baseball... we have to use 3 bases and a home plate... they already have 9 bases covered and home plate is a courthouse."
546174,Sinker,2011-02-01 02:25:00,8692,"There is a law somewhere about having a fire for the purpose of warmth, or cooking. I'm not sure if it relates to fires on the ice though. I know one thing, when Im in the woods speck fishing, I have a fire on the ice. If a CO ever came along, and gave me a ticket, he'd be seeing me in court. Its tradition, and I'll keep doing it until someone physically stops me from it!!  I can understand on a busy lake in southern ontario, but in the back woods, your not gonna stop me from having my fried bologne and a nice cup of tea off the fire!!  S."
546182,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-02-01 02:43:00,0,"i'll build a fire, but on shore on small lakes. i scavenge a few dead trees and leave nothing but char on the rocks.  no harm, no foul.  the CO's in my area are too busy harassing cottagers about sitting inside their camps watching their tipups to pay any mind to me having a fire on a back lake."
546202,mercman,2011-02-01 03:22:00,7054,"Again, the laws were put there to try and stop the ever present yahoos from throwing empty beer cans and garbage into an open fire, and leaving all this crap on the ice or ground.Charred wood and ashes are completely biodegradable and return to the ground whence they came.Glass, plastic and aluminum dont, and stay there long after the wood residue is gone. We, as concerned people pay again for the stupid few who take advantage. Not a thing we can do about it."
546204,moemoe,2011-02-01 03:26:00,352,"The inside drum of a dryer, makes a great fire pit on the ice, 2 on top of each other is better yet"
546285,SmokestackLightnin,2011-02-01 14:07:00,390, I guess this would also make it illegal to mark a spot on the ice where you have moved a hut from.
546301,Jonny,2011-02-01 14:39:00,1380, So you can find it in the summer?   
546504,SmokestackLightnin,2011-02-01 22:12:00,390,"  Nope, so people don't hit them and damage their ATVs or Snow Machines; or worse, get hurt.  Also helps people walking so they don't fall in old holes or worse large squares that have been cut in the ice.  I have gone through an old hut placement, while putting my own hut out about 10 years ago on Boshkung Lake.   Many people mark the old hut areas with Christmas trees or other foliage.  This law makes that courtesy illegal.  In some cases it's a matter more than courtesy, it's for the safety of others."
546506,irishfield,2011-02-01 22:15:00,26272,"Yet the MNR didn't even bother to answer my email, a couple years back, in regards to 100's of Christmas trees that get used to mark the sled trail from Midland and Penetang Harbour towards Honey Harbour every year..."
546709,camillj,2011-02-02 03:08:00,1988,ohhh welll ... I guess my three hour log idea is just gonna be a problem then ... unless of course I do it in the lid of a steel garbage can .. hey wait a minute ... that could just work
546710,Fishnwire,2011-02-02 03:08:00,983,  I'm not a bigger fan of the trail plan organizations...but I think they have permission to put them up with the agreement that they are removed before ice-out.  I could be wrong and it was not cool of the MNR to not respond to your question.
546716,irishfield,2011-02-02 03:11:00,26272,They do not remove them.. they let them melt out and float around for prop strikes in the spring.
