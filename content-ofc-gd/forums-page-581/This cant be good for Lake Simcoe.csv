546813,12footspringbok,2011-02-02 12:51:00,459,You're right brian it s not good.... Its GREAT.... Last year by this time everybody and their brother were roaming around the lake in their cars. I figure it'll give the fish a bit of a break and separate the men from the girls....   I put a 1 1/4 lug track on the old polaris for a reason.
546814,cityfisher,2011-02-02 12:51:00,959,Atv travel should be interesting ...
546818,Fish Farmer,2011-02-02 13:09:00,2234,"Could be a good thing, less pressure on the Whities and Trout, save gas money staying home. OH and Innisfil not getting my 10 I know, shut up Farmer."

546844,fishnsled,2011-02-02 14:09:00,3520,And to think I was going to sell the sled....really glad I didn't now. It will be the better way of getting around out there I would think.
546853,Fish Farmer,2011-02-02 14:20:00,2234,"fishnsled, can you go out and flatten the snow with your machine and pack her down and I'll follow your trail with my ATV  . Just make sure your trial takes me to the Whities"
546854,fishnsled,2011-02-02 14:22:00,3520, Anytime!  I better leave work now and start packing the trail for the weekend. Hey boss!!.......
546860,Fish Farmer,2011-02-02 14:32:00,2234,"Be nice if we could get together some time out there Brian, you me and the Spieler.  Thanks fishnsled,   I'll be watchin for your trail, just don't take me over think ice I can't swim"
546864,RickOnt,2011-02-02 14:44:00,669,I got up at Half past Lew O'clock and had a look outside   and went back to bed  At about 8:30 the snow stopped and i was thinking of heading out  But now its Snowing and blowing harder than before   So I am gonna get some things done on the Honey-Dew list   The wind should blow a lot of the snow off the smoother packed areas on the Lake   BUT   there will be some deeper drifts around any cracks ridges that will for sure cover up the Slush   I have not needed my shovel So far   But I will not be leaving home without it from now on   have Fun and be Careful out there  Rick
546910,Rob,2011-02-02 15:57:00,467,Well when the drifts are about 2 to 3 feet apart it will make for a slow and bumpy ride out there. Not to think about how much slush is going to be out there.  Rob C
546939,highdrifter,2011-02-02 16:47:00,2534,More kickers for Tybo's new sled..  Yeeeeehhaawwww!!
546946,BillM,2011-02-02 16:55:00,17367,"Sounds like I'm in for some fun with the new to me sled, lol."
546954,Fisherman,2011-02-02 17:07:00,7201,"Ya, but how wil the S-10 make it in the snow to get you there.."
546962,BillM,2011-02-02 17:29:00,17367, This truck doesn't get stuck  
546965,4x4bassin,2011-02-02 17:43:00,1025,"Nice rig Bill , I have an old toyota 4x4 and you are right these small trucks do not get stuck"
546966,BillM,2011-02-02 17:46:00,17367," Thanks man!  My oldmans '81 Toyota was similar (Actually, it was probably better then mine) impossible to get it stuck.  I've had to unhinge my fair share of highsided fullsized trucks, lol."
546974,MCTFisher9120,2011-02-02 17:53:00,3761," Nice truck man, Lindsay is not too bad at all. Very light snow right now where I am. Was up at 6:45 and it was really looking like a snow storm out there. Fresh snow was only 5 or 6 "" outside my door on way to garbage bin.  Ice Fishing this weekend!"
546978,BillM,2011-02-02 17:56:00,17367,"Mike, seems like a trend for pretty much everywhere!  People expecting lots of snow, waking up to only a little bit!"
546993,Hoppy,2011-02-02 18:22:00,95,Still snowing here in Innisfil. It big flakes now. Going to take the sleds out on the lake for a look see.    Hoppy
