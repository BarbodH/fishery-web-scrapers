543363,Twocoda,2011-01-25 03:53:00,4130,"On New Years day I decided to head down to the Saugeen river for the first time in many years WITHOUT a fishing rod. It was a missed feeling of years long gone by as i walked from the parking lot seeking ""something"" with a camera instead of a fishing rod. We know as fishermen and photographers that ""zen"" moment is not a garantee but a treasure albeit a capture with the camera or setting the hook on a trophy trout.As I aquainted myself with the D90 from my former FA /F3 days i decided to venture out on Dennys Dam because the water levels were insanely high for this time of year and there were trees hanging over the dam with no hope of freeing themselves from thier implanted positions....so i thought it might make for an interesting slow exposure because of the broken ice and debris flowing through the raging water.... and snapped a couple of shots ...some looked cool but for the most part i still hadnt found my ""zen"" and like a fisherman discovering a ""perfect"" fishing hole ...i noticed a rather large tree flowing up river from me close to my side of the dam and thought ""this has potential"" for a good depth of field test from the other lodged trees . The free flowing tree came within feet of where i had perched myself as it went over the dam. I braced myself for the shot and found i had turned the camera off so i missed a few seconds as the tree was going over...(interesting enough i NEVER had to turn off my other Nikons......so i quickly turned it on and without thought dropped to the floor of the dam...luckily these DSLRs dont reset from your previous settings. As i was turning on the camera and checking the exposure i noticed the ""new "" tree was violently bouncing from the rushing water and wasnt going to stay for very long as the ice started to build at the base of the tree....I took my shot....and this is what i got .....then it broke free.... Like most fish that meet the weigh in stations they never get captured again ...i think i found my 'zen""  again...well at least for the first day of the year!.
