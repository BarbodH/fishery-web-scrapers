546534,kickingfrog,2011-02-01 22:48:00,8333,"This has been talked about quite a bit in the last few weeks, so it's not news to hockey fans.  Not really sure how this billionaire will spend his money differently than the last?"
546537,Billy Bob,2011-02-01 22:51:00,5865,From what all indications are (news reports) this guy LOVES his hockey and the Sabres.....he donated MILLIONS to Penn State....something like 80 million for their hockey program so he's not afraid to spend money unlike Galisono.
