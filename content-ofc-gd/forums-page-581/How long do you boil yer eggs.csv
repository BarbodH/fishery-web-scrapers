As I walked in, almost awake, she turned to me and said Softly,"" You've got to make love to me this very moment!""    My eyes lit up and I thought, ""I am either still dreaming Or this is going to be my lucky day!"" Not wanting to lose the moment, I embraced her and then Gave it my all; right there on the kitchen, table.   Afterwards she said, ""Thanks,"" and returned to the stove, Her T-shirt still around her neck.   Happy, but a little puzzled, I asked, ""What was that all about?"" She explained, ""The egg timer's broken."""
