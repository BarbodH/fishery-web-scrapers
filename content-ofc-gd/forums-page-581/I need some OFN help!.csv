545960,NAW,2011-01-31 18:38:00,4022,"I need some advice.  I have a very big customer at work that loves fishing.  He’s coming up to Ontario the last week of July for a fishing trip with his family.  Here are the details: 1 week cottage / resort rental Looking for around $1000 a week Last week in July 1-2 hours from Toronto (His wife and daughter want to shop..) Fishing must be good  He’ll either want to rent a boat, or be taken out by a guide.  I’m sure he’s open to options.  Does anyone know of some good places that fit that above criteria?  I’m hoping for some comments from people with first hand experience.  I want this guy and his family to have a great time.  I would really like to get a list of places for him to choose from.  Any thoughts??"

545967,HTHM,2011-01-31 18:49:00,4082,For a guide I would suggest getting in touch with Garry2rs or any other guide on the board.
545970,GBW,2011-01-31 18:53:00,8460,"My wife, kids and I go here for a week or weekend every year.  Great people and food plus you can catch fish right in that bay so take a canoe out for free.  *edit* forgot the link... http://www.halimar.com/index.htm"

545979,NAW,2011-01-31 19:09:00,4022,"I think he's leaning toward Simcoe, and area.  Maybe Lake O.  Thanks for the links so far guys!"
546019,Harrison,2011-01-31 20:03:00,2202,When I ran my guide biz I used to set guys up at a resort on Rice Lake.  Then I would guide them for wallye and bass on Rice and then a day or two out of Port Hope for Salmon/Trout.  Maybe they can get set up on Rice at a place and I can forward you some guides info for Rice and Lake O if you like.  Just an option.
546020,Ron,2011-01-31 20:07:00,1683,"Rice Lake,  Golden Beach Cottages  Chris Giles Outdoors for a guide. Chris really knows his stuff, afterall I taught him everything he knows.  Seriously, this guy does know his stuff, not only on Rice Lake but pretty much any lake in the Kawarthas, Bay of Quinte, and certainly knows the Haliburtains as well."
546024,misfish,2011-01-31 20:13:00,29133,What that big resort on Couch? Fern or something like that? You could get Sir catch alot to guide.He knows Couch and Simcoe.Best of both lakes.
546026,NAW,2011-01-31 20:15:00,4022," I was thinking the same thing.  Kawartha eyes one day, Simcoe smallies for another, Lake O salmon/trout.  Maybe go for some Muskies one day too    Show these guys what Ontario fishin is all about eh!  Feel free to PM some good guides in these areas."
546027,NAW,2011-01-31 20:16:00,4022, Thats Steve right?  or is this Sir Catch alot?  I was going to PM him..  Thanks Brian!
