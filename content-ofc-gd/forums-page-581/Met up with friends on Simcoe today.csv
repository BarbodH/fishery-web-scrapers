546106,highdrifter,2011-02-01 00:05:00,2534," HAAH!  It's all starting to come back now..  Tybo's always good for a larf..  Oh, and hun?  I just got a call from a John over at 12th division..  Someone turned in my wallet!"
546108,Joey,2011-02-01 00:08:00,9122, That's fantastic  I assume without the cash?
546110,misfish,2011-02-01 00:09:00,29133,Glad you didnt say the 11th.That would of brought back nightmares.  Glad ya got it back HD.  Who carries cash these days J?
546112,highdrifter,2011-02-01 00:10:00,2534," Dunno..  Still have to go pick it up.  That would be the day, eh?!"
546115,highdrifter,2011-02-01 00:16:00,2534, Funny you mention.  Dad used to have a place a Black Creek and Lawrence..  a tiny spec of a house amongst subsidized high-rises.  Talk about colourful!!
546130,Handlebarz,2011-02-01 00:53:00,3790,Dang sorry to here of the damage you guys had.  I am just wondering how Keith got out with out that Ron fellow  Glad to see that some have time to enjoy the fishing
546136,misfish,2011-02-01 00:59:00,29133," LOL I was referring to the place my pop always had to pick me up at as a young juvvy. Bad boy,what ya going to do now."
546155,Rod Caster,2011-02-01 01:54:00,5784,"Great photos and nice fish everyone. That laker sure is pretty. That's a good gash on your sled...hopefully it's only cosmetic.  Was the wallet left on the ice? If so, that's amazing that somebody found it. Maybe it was the guy who moved his shack when he returned to mark the spot... haha not likely."
546175,danc,2011-02-01 02:31:00,4677,"Man. This thread reminds me why I quit ice fishing years ago. I had a similar experience with my Dad on the back of my sled many years ago. Turns out he dislocated his shoulder and was off work for 6 months after that. I did a lot of ice fishing in my day. Not like you guys do though. Most often it was a 5 to 10 mile sled into a secluded lake where you'd not see another soul all day. No huts, no rods, no heaters. If there was  another party on  the lake, it was crowded. And we did this at -40 a few times. Now I'm happy to spend my weekends at home on my couch when the lakes are frozen over. You ever hear the old say that says ""With age comes wisdom""?? It's true."
546220,fishnsled,2011-02-01 04:10:00,3520,Scary stuff!  Very happy to hear that everyone is OK. Great that your wallet was turned in HD. And a few managed a couple of fish. Not too bad of a day considering the way it started off.
546222,vinnimon,2011-02-01 04:17:00,2593,"Ouch on the sled part, at least you guys were ok.  "
545584,Joey,2011-01-31 00:30:00,9122,"We met up with our usual partner in crime today, Terry, on Simcoe to do some fishing.  Had a special guest with us, Fidel (Highdrifter) and headed out to the planned spot where Lloyd and Keith were already set up.  We followed Terry out, making a Fidel sandwich on our sled, pulling two huts with all our gear.  Before you know it, Terry is airborne, and then so were we.  Must have cleared a good 12 feet before we landed with a thud.  We all got off and made sure nobody was hurt, flipped back over the overturned huts and had a good laugh.  Epic was the word Fidel used I think.  Checked the sled and found some cracks     Some yahoo moved his hut and did not put a branch or tree to mark it and you couldn't see the big mound until you were right on it.  Oh well, nobody too hurt so time to move on.  Total damage to us was the sled, Paul's fishfinder and my new thermos.  Terry broke a rod and a few other items, he can post his losses!          Got to where Lloyd and Keith were already set up and got ourselves set up.  Not long after, Terry has a fish on and a nice whitie at that     Yes its true, Terry caught a fish      Shortly after that, Keith got a nice laker, followed by a whitie!!!        Paul had one on, but it got off     And I've come to the conclusion that its easier for a man to do everything with his tongue sticking out      Then I had one on, but it got off too  Lloyd also had some on and then off again.  We still marked fish the rest of the day, but no takers.  Some good follows, but then back down they went.  Paul and Fidel shared a hut and I could hear laughter all day      We had a pretty uneventful ride back (thank God) and are home safe and sound, ready for the next outting.  Great to see you Terry, Lloyd, Fidel and Keith, we had a nice day fishing with you today  Joey"
545586,ckrb2007,2011-01-31 00:34:00,449,"Good job guys! Looks like a fun day had by all...........minus the meat-head who didn't mark his hut hole. That could've been a lot worse. Glad you guys came out ok after that ""launching"".  Colin"
545590,Leecher,2011-01-31 00:38:00,7832,"Just doesn't get any better than that.... out fishing on the hard stuff, amongst fiends and hooking into a few Glad nobody got hurt Joey.....  but looks like your new sled got some serious damage Thanks for sharing Leechman"
545594,Grimace,2011-01-31 00:40:00,2020,"Nice day.  I am assuming that is the new sled, what a heartbreaker.   With almost zero depth perception in the snow there would have been no way of knowing until too late.  Nice to see a good day of fishing otherwise."
545609,Fisherman,2011-01-31 00:53:00,7201,"Main thing is you're okay, the rest can be fixed."
545615,I'mHooked,2011-01-31 01:05:00,525,Sounds like a great day! (minus the airborne portion)
545618,Terry,2011-01-31 01:10:00,14456,"always exciting when we go fishing  but we didn't need the evil knievel trick...really glad no one was hurt,,  I was really surprised how many things were broken that were in my hut  when I went to put my auger back on the rack I saw the rack was broken too I tried to give it a quick fix but half way back I saw it was almost dragging on the ground so I had to sit the auger on my lap  it's going to be a lot of work so I can go again next weekend but I will be ready  can't wait to get out with you again"
545621,Sinker,2011-01-31 01:19:00,8692,Looks like fun guys!! Also another reason to leave the expensive gear for the softwater!!! Stuff takes a beating out there!  S.
545683,SlowPoke,2011-01-31 02:43:00,2984,"Great post Joey, sorry to hear about the damage!"
545684,Dusky,2011-01-31 02:47:00,310,Glade you all are ok. Nice report.
545686,icefisherman,2011-01-31 02:48:00,952,"Nice report and pictures as always Joey...are you a photographer for living?  Cheers, Ice Fisherman"
545748,fishhunter,2011-01-31 11:49:00,604,"Well it was good to see you all out on the ice once again. It was a slow day but as they say "" you should have stayed a bit longer"" lol soon after you left the fish thought it was safe to come around and start hitting. Will see you next week. Kieth and I will be taking Dano   out with us next Sat."
545753,Roy,2011-01-31 12:06:00,13728,Great report Joey. It looked like a fine day on the ice but those sled flips are SCARY! How about if you drive and Paul be the navigator?
545759,corvette1,2011-01-31 12:50:00,1765,well that sucks glad no one got hurt
545760,skeeter,2011-01-31 12:53:00,1907,"Morning Roy. If you read her post carefully, you will find that she was driving. she said terry went airbourne first then they did... if paul was driving then they would have been the first to go airbourne, cause they would have been way ahead , and terry would have seen them and avoided the launch ramp. you know paul, if ya aint at mach2 then get out of my way..."
545768,solopaddler,2011-01-31 13:20:00,8605,"Great day on the ice, but wow scary stuff! That could've been a lot worse."
545771,motion,2011-01-31 13:25:00,403,"Hey Joey, not much fun when some idiot almost ruins your whole day. I wish they would be a little more considerate for others out there. These are most likely the same guys that leave their garbage on the ice hope that it will miraculously evaporate before the ice melts."
545790,irishfield,2011-01-31 13:59:00,26272,"What's with you and Paul always playin around on the sleds out there Hun?  Glad the day went well from there out.  BTW.. stop following Terry, isn't that how this happened last year?"
545796,TJQ,2011-01-31 14:12:00,7806,Ill have yto give ya snowmobile driving lessons.. lol.. NOT... its the reason I have a 250..
545805,EC1,2011-01-31 14:24:00,930,Good Stuff Joey! Glad you guys didn't get hurt. Did you get any fish yourself?
545809,Harrison,2011-01-31 14:29:00,2202,"Great report.  Glad everyone ""landed"" their jumps and everyone is ok.  Scary for sure.  It almost happened to me on Scugog one year except I was in my truck and towing the 8x6 hut behind me on the trailer.  I saw it last minute and swerved putting me into full blown 360's on the glare ice with drifts.  Spooky looking out your drivers side window and seeing your hut on the trailer beside you.  Luckily, all turned out ok.  PLEASE mark your hut holes!"
545851,Joey,2011-01-31 15:26:00,9122,"Thanks for all the replies guys, ya, it was scary, and my back and neck are a bit sore today (and chin) but as was said, we landed safely so I think Terry and Paul both know what they are doing in the sled driving department.  EC1, no fish for me, but I did get to play with one that took a good long run on me  Also yes, please mark your hut site if you move it!!!  Joey"
545902,misfish,2011-01-31 16:38:00,29133,Glad yer all ok.Crazy. To bad about the damage on the new sled J. That sux.
545923,highdrifter,2011-01-31 17:07:00,2534,"Joey!  Thanks again for a great day.  It was pretty awesome to spend it amongst such good company..   A costly day for you and myself (I still can't find my wallet) but, it's all good.  Or was it ""Life goes on""?!  And about the laughter coming from Paul's hut?!  I think that might have been the leaky propane heater..  Hope we can do that again real soon, hopefully when it's not so darn frigid outside.  Great to meet you Terry and Lloyd."
546077,Tybo,2011-01-31 22:25:00,1373,"The way I hit.It was a good thing I was pulling two boggens. The second one stop the first one from flipping on top of use.  The way I feel today,is like I hit a immovable oject."
