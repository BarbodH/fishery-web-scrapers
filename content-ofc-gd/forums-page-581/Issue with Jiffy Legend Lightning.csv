546431,hunterjoe84,2011-02-01 20:22:00,52,I have a problem with it stalling out 3-4 times before it stays going to drill holes.  It just bogs down when you give it throttle.  I run the recommended 24-1 ratio but it seems a little oil heavy.  Anyone else have this model?  What mix do you use?
546447,Old Man,2011-02-01 20:48:00,822,"All the Jiffy's I've ever seen, use 40:1. Check your manual."
546458,canadadude,2011-02-01 21:03:00,769,"it may need to warm up abit, also there are 2 idle screws on the carb that may need adjusting. My brother adjusted mine(he's a marine mechanic), it took him about 5min to have it running like a top."
546459,John the Fisherman,2011-02-01 21:04:00,45,"I run 24:1 as well, so I don't think it is fuel.  Do you let it warm up enough?  If mine is not warm it will bog out and stall.  I have to let it warm up at about half choke, slowly give it throttle until it runs steady.  When it is warm it will start without issues."
546462,Old Man,2011-02-01 21:11:00,822,This came right from the Jiffy website.  What is the correct mixture of oil and gasoline to use for fuel in a Jiffy?   The correct ratio for all Jiffy Power Ice Drills is 40 to 1. This means 3.2 oz of Jiffy Two-Cycle Oil is mixed with 1 Gallon of fresh gasoline. If you don't use a 40:1 oil mixture it will void all warranties.
546481,wallyboss,2011-02-01 21:43:00,1095,Run it longer on half choke.
546489,irishfield,2011-02-01 21:49:00,26272,Depends on year.. the old Jiffy 3 HP are 24:1.. newer ones 40:1. I run 50:1 in my 2 HP Jiffy as I already have 50:1 mixed for my Stihl saw and weed eater (ya I have a weed eater! lol). Runs like a charm.. but still needs to be warmed up for a few minutes before drilling.. like any engine should be..
546667,Fisherman,2011-02-02 02:10:00,7201,"Bogs down when you give it throttle?, needs a wee bit more gas on the high speed jet if you have an adjustable one.  Gas/oil mix doesn't affect it.(at that rate)"
546722,trapshooter,2011-02-02 03:21:00,1234,Sounds normal to me... just the same as any Jiffy I've ever seen out on the ice.
546728,limeyangler,2011-02-02 03:27:00,5204,    all the above...mine does the same
546865,canadadude,2011-02-02 14:50:00,769,"Thats right, We adjusted it 1/4 turn and it made all the difference no more bogging. Still needs to warm up especially on the really cold days"
546868,Harrison,2011-02-02 14:58:00,2202," So true...  I comes with age, I have an oldie goldie Jiffy, but still does the job.  Try half throttle until she starts to bite, then slowly give it to full."
546918,CRAPPIE,2011-02-02 16:07:00,213,"I bought a strikemaste laser electric ice drill 2 months ago and the only word I can say is ""perfect""  drill 20-30 holes easily and one time I forget to charge it but it's still good to go. No fuel, no warm up, no smell and light too"
546927,Old Man,2011-02-02 16:30:00,822," Yup. Next time I buy, it'll be an electric."
546975,fishnsled,2011-02-02 17:54:00,3520, So you only get 20-30 holes per charge?
546988,Bluegill,2011-02-02 18:14:00,197," My Jiffy Lightning has the same problem.  For me it works well after these steps:  1 start with closed choke 2 after a first short run it stops immediately. Open the choke now 5 mm and start again 3 if it runs now, then open the choke complete and give it throttle  After that procedure I can drill without problems"
