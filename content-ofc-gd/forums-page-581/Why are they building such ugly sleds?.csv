546720,skeeter,2011-02-02 03:15:00,1907,"when the new ones came out i didnt like them either. now i love the looks, and the fuel milage..... if i could i would take one of those in a heart beat!! but i still love my 97 ski doo.  "
546780,Jonny,2011-02-02 05:20:00,1380, The machine does look nice beside the portable hut. And your custom attachment for the box sure fixed you up to carry gear.  The lake looks like any number of Northern Ontario lakes. Without prior knowledge it would be hard to tell the pics were taken in the NWT.   
546783,thebigcatch,2011-02-02 05:33:00,138,IMO the arctic cat crossfire 800 or the k1 (k1000) is the one for me !!
546792,Handlebarz,2011-02-02 09:22:00,3790,this one here might be good on gas but a little chilly when heading out fishing  
546924,myot,2011-02-02 16:20:00,131,Ride a new sled and you will understand the reason for the disign they may not be as fast top end but the handling and bottom end are second to none  Dan
546509,Jonny,2011-02-01 22:17:00,1380,Why have they started building such god-awful UGLY sleds?  Some of them look like they hit a wall before they even got out of the showroom.  I see them running by my place on the lake and they look ridiculous.   
546510,GBW,2011-02-01 22:19:00,8460,one and a 1/2 words. X-games...
546511,SmokestackLightnin,2011-02-01 22:22:00,390,The yellow one is pretty.  I went on a run with friends from my place in Phelpston to Coldwater on Sunday for lunch with friends and there were four of the new 1200 Ski Doos with us.  They looked awesome but the only complaint came come from the ladies.  The new ski doos are really wide compared to the previous generation which my wife and I run (2006).  The girls can't stand up like they used to when riding bumpy trails.  Bit once again they were real nice and real quiet.
546512,Old Man,2011-02-01 22:23:00,822,"It's what the youth of today are demanding. I personally aren't into the higher riding position, but most of younger riders like to pretend their snow cross riders nowadays."
546518,Jonny,2011-02-01 22:33:00,1380, One of my fishing buddies used to have an 80's model Yamaha Phazer --- you couldn't bog that thing down in anything. But it was a sleek looking machine.   
546521,Jonny,2011-02-01 22:34:00,1380," Yeah, in a kind of ""stealth fighter"" way.  And not quite as pug-nosed as some.   "
546522,misfish,2011-02-01 22:36:00,29133," Skidoo is working on a sled for the ladies. Just for the points you said. They could ride side saddle,but is out dated.LOL"
546530,DRIFTER_016,2011-02-01 22:43:00,10439,How about this thing? You get to pay 15 grand for 1/2 a sled!!!  Polaris 800-RUSH-PRO-R
546533,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-02-01 22:48:00,0,"the new platform sleds are kind of weird looking, but the performance and handling is not even comparable IMO.  i myself still ride an older sled, a 2002 ski doo grand touring, but the REV platform model sleds i've ridden are awesome.  they are lighter and handle much better on the trails.  also, the new 4 strokes are wild!  my sled gets something like 11 mpg where the newer 4 strokes are getting just shy of 30.  in this day and age, that's a big deal in fuel costs."
546536,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-02-01 22:49:00,0,i have a few chums that still ride the old phazers...  i loved that light on the steering wheel!
546544,DRIFTER_016,2011-02-01 22:56:00,10439,"  You bet!!! Gas milage is awsome on the 4 strokes, although they are quite a bit heavier. I have a 2008 Yamaha RS Venture GT that has a 1000cc 120hp 4 stroke and get 160kms per tank pulling 2 loaded boggans while the 2 strokes get 1/2 of that. The looks of the GT are nice as well. When I bought the sled I steered away from the regular RS Venture because it looked like an angry wasp."
546546,SRT8 smoker craft,2011-02-01 22:58:00,1107,"  I like that one prolly rip your arms outta the socket when ya crack it wide open, the 800s were fast years ago in the last chassis they had I can't imagine what that thing would be like."
546547,Bernie,2011-02-01 22:58:00,3190,"I know what you are saying Jocko, they seem ugly to me too. But hop on one and you will understand. These new sleds work incredible.  There is a reason for the way they are engineered. Low center of gravity (gets the engine down low) long travel suspension for a smooth ride, less belly pan which slowed them down in snow, wide ski stance for stability, lightweight construction for power to weight ratios, handling and fuel economy."
546552,JohnF,2011-02-01 23:03:00,3494," Function over form. Back when I was neck deep in the sled biz the sleds were still pretty homely, and the functionality sucked too. They did get a bit prettier for a few years (decades perhaps) but the prettiest ones were always the sleds that were designed for performsnce like the Kalamazoos, the Speedways and the Thunderjets etc. Even the Blizzards were pretty. But that's just a matter of personal preference I suppose. I happened to like the noisy fast ones.  JF"
546567,DRIFTER_016,2011-02-01 23:20:00,10439," Mine is a luxury touring sled, not one of them racing dealies but when I can get it to hook up it tries to separate my arms from the rest of my body. It's more streamlined than the performance jobs which I like as well. Plus I can rip along at 110 with me, my buddy and frabil flip over across the lake. Gotta watch out for bumps though.  "
546569,Rod Caster,2011-02-01 23:25:00,5784,"Good call Jocko. The new edge design is very techo-geeky. I liked the 2002 ish polaris prox's, the indy trails, older Machs , yammy SRX's etc. I'm relatively young but appreciate good design. The new ones belong in video games.  Can't compare with the engineering though!"
546610,phiphntek,2011-02-02 00:40:00,115,"I also had Blizzards back in the eary '80s.Awesome machines.Haven't ridden for a long time but would love to try one of the new Gen X machines.Higher CG , more power and handling like never before sounds like a blast.To pull the Clam ? I don't think so but most of the manufacturers still make utility, touring machines."
546632,Twocoda,2011-02-02 01:22:00,4130, not just the youth        
546634,F7Firecat,2011-02-02 01:26:00,347,gotta love a cat
546636,Jonny,2011-02-02 01:30:00,1380,"    You fellas are right of course.  I figured it would have something to do with performance. No sense monkeying with the motor position, the rider's position and the track if a sled handled worse. Maybe they just get the look wrong (in my taste) in some models, just like the car companies can produce some UGLEEEE cars and trucks.   Now that's still a seriously good-looking machine by any standards. It doesn't fit the pug-ugly category.  It would be nice to see some of your own pics of it some time in operation when you get it out fishing. I'm still motoring along on my old Pantera. Always liked it and still do. For the running I do - simply 4 to 6 miles out on the ice, and then the same back home - I don't think I could talk my wife into a new one. If I did, it wouldn't be one of the real pug-nosed jobs.   "
546638,Jonny,2011-02-02 01:34:00,1380," Hell if I did that, my back would not thank me! My track stays firmly planted on the ground (or the ice).   "
546639,Old Man,2011-02-02 01:36:00,822, I think those late 70's early 80's Blizzards were one of the best looking sleds ever made.  
546643,Rod Caster,2011-02-02 01:42:00,5784,  Looks like the Challenger of sleds.
546651,Old Man,2011-02-02 01:51:00,822,Another classic which looked great and was one of the fastest in it's day. My cousin had one and it was ahead of it's time.  
546691,DRIFTER_016,2011-02-02 02:48:00,10439,  Ask and ye shall recieve.
