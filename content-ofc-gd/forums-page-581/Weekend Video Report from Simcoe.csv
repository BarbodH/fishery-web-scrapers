We never smashed them at any point but it was steady catching, and as always there were better times than others.  For the weekend, we managed close to 20 whities and only 3 small lakers haha. No herring this weekend at all, I dont think we even marked one.  Kind of a nice change. Fish caught on the usual, williams spoons, tubes and laker takers.  Fished 88-95 feet Got a few of the fish on video for you guys to have a peak at.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aR7mGh4i29Q"
