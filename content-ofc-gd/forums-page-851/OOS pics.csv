C'mon, the fish is out of season. Rules burn, but they're there for a reason, to protect our ressources.  Two different issues in one statement..    The board rules(suggestions) and the Regs. What rules are you referring to when taking picture of OOS fish? There are none."
339988,ch312,2009-05-10 16:24:00,1590, so now someone who takes pics of an OOS fish would be a poacher? i sure am glad you are not a CO. i highly doubt any CO out there has the same attitude as you...and thats a good thing  holding a fish out of the water for a few seconds will not cause it any harm and is no different than while the fish is in season.
339991,Greencoachdog,2009-05-10 16:32:00,8163,  I was wondering why you sounded kinda cranky... until I read that part!  Say no more!  ... I'm serious... don't say another word!  
340003,highdrifter,2009-05-10 17:03:00,2534," Really?  I thought it's quite clear.  The regs say:  "" Fish must be released emmediatly"".  Board rules state:  No OOS fish pics.  Maybe we outta tweak the rule a bit.  No OOS fish pics, unless it's a bass."

340010,TroutnMuskieHunter,2009-05-10 17:28:00,1362,"   Hey ch312......what's your definition of the word ""immediately""????????  Here's what the dictionary reads:  1. without lapse of time; without delay; instantly; at once: Please telephone him immediately. 2. with no object or space intervening. 3. closely: immediately in the vicinity. 4. without intervening medium or agent; concerning or affecting directly  A few seconds (probably more) to fight the OOS fish, a few seconds (probably more) to unhook the OOS fish, a few seconds (probably more) to pose and have your mug taken with your OOS fish......if you've caught this OOS fish and it's in a spawning stage, and you're in a strong current or strong wind, you're taking this fish further away from it's spawning area....  I just don't get it...unhook it ASAP and let it go!!"
340012,kickingfrog,2009-05-10 17:34:00,8333,"The Ontario regs say you must release an OOS fish immediately. If you can justify taking a picture to a CO good on ya, you are still wrong however. If you get a fine, don't look to me for a sympathetic ear because you are breaking the regs, cut and dry.  If you think the regs should be changed, do something constructive to that end. Provide some science, although you may need a bio for that. oh oh.  The board would prefer you not post pictures OOS fish. If you post pics of OOS fish here you may expect some congratulations and some rhubarbs. Don't act surprised.  A true sportsman not only follows the regulations but he/she will help set an example and educate others to help preserve and improve our resources for the future.  Many people may come across this site and look to it for examples of acceptable or best practises, best way to hold a musky for example. Vertical, horizontal or in the water? None of the three are set out in the regs, that I am aware of, but we can help explain the merits of the better options and why. I still see people holding walleye and pike by the eyes (not here) before releasing them.  Everyday that I learn more I realize how little I actually know. If you think that there is nothing else left to learn then I would like very much to have a beer with you because I have lots more to learn."
340014,Spiel,2009-05-10 17:40:00,9065,How many folks here have had there picture taken with a slot fish?  How many folks using a conservation license have a picture of themselves with a musky or perhaps a sturgeon?  How many folks here follow (to the letter) all the board rules (even the ones you don't agree with)?  How many folks here are posting while under the influence of illegal drugs?  Or perhaps under the influence of alcohol (besides me)?  Did I leave anyone out?
340016,alphaalpha,2009-05-10 17:47:00,475,"  if you want to get that literal with the term ""release it immediately"" you should probably cut your line the second you realize its an OOs fish."

I think there is a rule on here saying that all Out Of Season fish need to be clearly marked with OOS so the viewer knows that the catch is indeed out of season. Respect the fishery and there will be fewer problems. Remember by releasing the fish quickly you are doing the fishery a favour as you are limiting the time it takes for the panfish to creep in and eat all of the eggs and fry.

It usually has to do with bass because bass, in the more populated areas of the Province, opens later and tons of folks inadvertently catch them. I think it was a couple of years ago that a dad and young daughter went out fishing and the child caught a really nice bass, yes, it was out of season and as proud as they both were, her dad was lambasted on the board for having posted it.  This thread and other similar threads is the reason that we have the 'kind' suggestion to not post pictures of out of season fish. There's absolutely NOTHING illegal about it. It just rubs some people the wrong way.  Please, give it a rest folks. I understand that some folks are unhappy with it but that's the way it is.  Get out fishing.  ps. I hope that that young daughter is still fishing and wasn't turned off by what was done to her dad here."

339926,Radnine,2009-05-10 13:54:00,1538,"How is taking a picture of an out of season fish any more harm to it than taking the picture when it is in season? Because a Gobi is clever enough to say ""hey, he's taking a picture, get in there and pig out!!"" We whine about the treatment of fish on what seems to be becoming a more frequent basis, and when you think about it, it is generally based on a picture. Don't roll them in grass, don't hang them vertically, don't squeeze them too tight; How about don't put a metal hook in their mouth in the first place? Or, how about don't have a site on the Internet that is basically there for the purpose of bragging via photographs? I think that the idea that one can selectively fish is basically flawed. If a bass would attack anything thrown their way while on the nest, isn't the problem that we are on the water in the first place? A can of worms indeed. All that being said, posting a picture of an OOS fish is a bit like bragging about the hole in one you got, after you put your first shot in the pond (actually a hole-in-three). It doesn't count so keep it to yourself. Jim"

The only thing I disagree with in Bass fishing, is sight fishing for them and pulling them off the bed when they're nesting... dumping them into the livewell and hauling them around the lake for a Bass Tournament weigh in!  They don't all breed at the same time, so you can always catch some that aren't on the nest!"

339939,jediangler,2009-05-10 14:17:00,1923,"A panfish can clean out a nest completely in 5 seconds. Chances are the nest has been pillaged before you even land your OOS bass. You might as well take a pic and brag to everyone about your new PB (Poacher's Best) and how none of it's offspring will grow up to be caught in the future. Some conservation areas have made changes to how they run things to try and cut down on this happening. Island lake in Orangeville for example. They used to have a pike derby to help reduce the high numbers of pike in that lake. The idea was that the bass fishery would improve if the pike numbers went down. They found that during the tourney too many bass were pulled from the beds and the crappie and other panfish were cleaning out there nests. They no longer hold that pike derby, which is too bad for people that fish Belwood lake, because that is where the 200 or so pike that were caught during the tourney were live released. Valens conservation area doesn't even open till the end of June. They have pike and crappie and could make considerably more money every year if they opened at the end of April. The reason there is that it's a nesting area for many bird species and boaters would interfere with that. The result remains pretty clear though as many large bass are caught during their derby in July. Just follow the guidelines (not laws) of this site and don't post your OOS fish in your reports."

339960,richyb,2009-05-10 15:05:00,774,"Whats the biggie in taking a pic of an OOS bass ? and why cant it be a PB ? because they will hit anything ? . How about the channel cats in the grand ? they are concentrated and they will nail most baits. Guess you cant count a PB untill they are out of the river and scattered out again in the lakes.  Steelhead are in the rivers to spawn and people target them while spawning ( yes open season but is it really different?)  I dont see any harm taking a quick pic of an OOS fish as long as your not targeting them and it was an accidental catch. I think the people that do see the harm are just jealous. Its not like they are catching them , filleting the sides off and then trying to release the fish.  ps. My PB pike is 14 pounds that I caught while fishing in the perch festival and it was OOS . I caught it , reeled it in , held it in my hands and released it , is that not the definition of CATCHING a fish ?"

The regulations clearly state "" Fish accidentally caught during the closed season must be immediately released back to the water"" and holding the fish out of water for a picture does not fit into immediately.  Sometimes I wish I was a CO and nail all the ignorant poachers. The MNR set seasons because fish should not be handled at that time of year period.  Sounds like you guys would publicly state that grabbing a squeeze doesn't hurt anybody it's not a rape. And they call us all sportsman."

So you might want to read it over a little better because its not ""all good"" when their well protected eggs/nests are getting raided because you decided to target out OOS fish, or decided not release it right away.

I don't think that fish would be sitting on a redd this time of year..  it may have been slowly making it's way to spawning grounds, but this catch didn't affect the spawn much in my opinion.

339806,Jigger,2009-05-10 02:20:00,1237,"Just want to direct you to line 6 of the rules guys. I can understand that you got a sweet fish. But if its OOS, theres no reason to keep it out of the water, let alone have a moment to get the camera out and take a pic. I probably wouldn't say anything if it was one post. But thats 3 in a week. More bass are going to be caught as the season gets closer. Especially on the May long weekend, as the bass are on their nests, there is a valuable conservation mindset that every moment off the nest is precious. Please keep it to yourselves. By posting and keeping a pic of an OOS fish on the board, you're giving the impression that its ""just a few seconds out of the water, no big deal"". This validates other thread starters who in turn post more OOS pics of their personal best bass.  To the thread starters in question. I was going to PM you guys with this message, but thought it may be better as a small reminder of our common goal. A better fishery. Its a topic that comes up every year, so don't think this is a personal attack. Hope you can get that PB when the seasons are all open and you can strut your stuff with pride!"

I was on simcoe for pike today and the bass were everywhere, u just have to be responsible and change up your location if you start catching too many bass. we always move out of an area if we catch two or more out of season fish, we not only do this to protect the bass... we also have our ethics when it comes to fishing.  on a good note i was happy to see that all of the bass hooked, hardly any were brought into the boat. almost all fish were released at the side of the boat with the help of some needle nose plyers."

339846,pikeie,2009-05-10 04:50:00,380," As of yet...  I could say the same thing about lake ontario steelhead, that lake has huge numbers of fish. what if i went out of my way to catch a fish that was out of season or in a sanctuary (past the CN bridge) and post it? the fish was caught then relesed nothing wrong there... right??"
339848,Ben_Daniels,2009-05-10 05:29:00,435,"Wheres the can of worms, where is it!? O my god its open  I don't think its a huge deal but i do get mad for the sole reason that I can't go fishing for what you caught! makes me jealous   I personally don't think we should even have a closed season but I do respect it and follow the laws. In most places fishing for spawning bass is a moral/ethical question. Here in Ontario its a legal one. I don't think its wrong to fish for bass during the spawn but i do think its wrong to target bass on beds. Even when there are bass on beds there are also usually bass finished spawning and bass that haven't spawned yet. I guess most people don't understand that and I guess that's a big reason why we have a closed season. If you catch a bass off a bed and keep out away for more than a minute or two it probably won't go back to the bed and all those eggs will get eaten. Fish that aren't spawning I don't think it has any affect on them really when their caught. And I gotta say it does take skill to catch a big bass on a bed, not as easy as you think! When I lived in Florida where there was no closed season we'd catch more big fish when the spawn had finished. I found it a lot harder to catch a big bass off a bed with lures than after the spawn finished using a big shiner under a float. But after seeing the affect that taking bass off beds had, I stopped fishing for bass that were on beds, because morally/ethical I felt bad about it. When you take a bass of a bed and it goes back to the bed the fish loses all its color, looks pale, its eyes look weird (it basically looks like its cracked out) This was in Florida where I could legally fish for bedding bass. Just my two cents on the bass season.....What was this topic about again? I think I need another beer.  -Ben"
339849,Jigger,2009-05-10 05:36:00,1237," Says the the walleye fisherman. Whats next? Guys posting pb musky pics that they got fishing walleye? Point is, if you're taking OOs fish, which find their way onto your line alot at this time of year, they should be released as soon as possible. Unless you plan on harvesting that fish, which is illegal because they're OOS, the priority should be in the the best interest of your catch. Having the fish out of the water for more time than is required stresses the fish out which could lead to an unsuccessful spawn. Theres also predation from other species to consider when the bass are on their nests as pikie already mentioned."
339856,Terry,2009-05-10 10:12:00,14456,"it is not against the law to take a picture of a OOS fish, so if you catch  fish that screams out to you to take it's picture, then do it. do,'t let other peoples morals influence you, it has nothing to do with the law but you may want to respect the rules of this board and not post it, cause many self rightest people will complain"
339870,bushart,2009-05-10 11:25:00,2628,"There's many sides to this one.....and the moral high ground is a slippery slope.  If you catch a spawning fish on a windy day and during fighting the fish you blow 50-100 yards down the lake--how long will it take to get back to it's nest? about as long as a snapshot?  IF we're looking for the moral highground---lets discuss the ""Tournament"" bass anglers targeting these fish 2-3 weeks prior to opener.  I live beside a very popular bass tourney lake and witness this with my own eyes while out for walleyes.  Maybe we should all move to northwestern Ontario where the season does'nt close and you can catch spawning bass till your arms fall off.  Rules say You can.  I wish everyone luck because enforcing ethics is far different than teaching them  Bushart"
339871,Terry,2009-05-10 11:35:00,14456,"but we don't need to apply moral or ethics to fishing for bass before season is open it is against the law period no need for discussion call tips and turn them in...... but  if you catch one while   fishing for crappie, that is a whole different story and if you want to take a picture it;s not against the law, so is it really any of our business...hate the law not the person acting within the law, don't  fight the person obeying the law, fight the law makers  if it is not against the law.....leave people alone"
