I was just wondering if there are any casting anglers out there who've used these and had some success?  If so I'd love to hear what's the proper techniques for using them.   Ciao,  MJP"

You may need to use a longer or heavier leader. Keep experimenting until you start catching fish!  ... you'll want to consider floating tippet material for Dry Flies, fluoro sux for topwater."
