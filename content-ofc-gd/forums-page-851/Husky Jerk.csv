340034,SBCregal,2009-05-10 18:30:00,688,"ive had some luck with the blue/orange ones, as well as the clown.  i also have black/silver which has seen a few fish"

340044,Garry2Rs,2009-05-10 19:06:00,1425,"What are you trying to catch? The size of the target will give you an idea of what size the bait should be... What are the target species eating? The size and species of the food will give you an idea what the size and pattern of the bait should be... What will the bottom colour be? Bait fish camouflage themselves to blend-in with their background...  Do you know how to fish this bait? It is not a toss and crank-it-back lure. You cast and give it  sharp jerk... There might be other ways, but I start and end each jerk with a slack line. This lets the bait turn to the side at the end of each jerk. The next jerk snaps it around in a new direction, it glides and then turns again on the slack line... Good Luck"
340060,Mike the Pike,2009-05-10 20:43:00,3421,This 5 inch suspending Husky Jerk ............   Caught this nice Walleye last weekend.     I like the clown colour also red head chartreuse and gold.  Blue turquoise is also a hit with walleye and pike black and silver for bass.  I love these lures.Good Luck
340063,Roy,2009-05-10 20:59:00,13728,All colours are good. The colours you keep in the water are the ones that work.
340079,Joeytier,2009-05-10 22:09:00,3990,I have a deep diving 5 inch husky jerk that's probably caught me the most walleye out of any crankbait I've ever used.  I also use a white shallow diving husky jerk for brown trout with great success.  Great baits.
