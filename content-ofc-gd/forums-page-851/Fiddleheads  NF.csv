338992,Stern Rules,2009-05-07 04:06:00,342,Buster looks like you're a fan of Stern too or at least Artie Lange. Nice.
339106,BUSTER,2009-05-07 18:57:00,1336,  stern junkie here!  daily.
339248,superdad,2009-05-08 02:39:00,353,"We travelled far and wide and we picked up sometoday at A&P, no cleaning or walking thru mud.  Been there, Done That and bought the tee shirt....  They'll be yummy on Mothers' Day.....  David  aka  Superdad"
340200,Stern Rules,2009-05-11 03:01:00,342,I found more today so I'm good for the year now. Now I know where to go next year. No need to get 'em in N.B. now. Here's 2 pics. Got 9 lbs.   Thanks for the info on where to find some.  
340222,Paully,2009-05-11 10:11:00,712,  This looks more like a picture out of High Times
337383,Stern Rules,2009-05-02 23:37:00,342,Does anybody know if there are any areas around Brantford where you can pick fiddleheads within an hour radius? I don't mind going far to get them. Any info would be appreciated.
337385,Fudd,2009-05-02 23:44:00,94,I always went to the Elora gorge park. Probably a bit more than 50kms but a load there. Go in the park... drive down to the bridge that crosses the river. Just as you head down the hill to the bridge on the left hand side there is a spring/creek set back in the bush... tonnes here and also some nice water crest
337389,Fang,2009-05-02 23:50:00,1330,"Fiddle heads and brook trout creeks go hand in hand. If you know anywhere local that has brookies, browns or rainbows take a walk and have a look. My spot is the credit river just north of Inglewood right through to the forks. Since they made it artificial only I don't get back up there too much."
337393,Musky or Specks,2009-05-02 23:57:00,2710,Check along Whitemans Creek at the CA Property  2nd weekend in may special on my menu Fresh Brook trout and Fiddlehead Risotto
337456,tinbanger,2009-05-03 01:58:00,1028,don't know your area but if you miss out this spring ( they don't last long) keep an eye out for the mature plants ( ostrich ferns) during the summer months and make a mental note.Wet boggy areas are the key good hunting  Now if I could just find some morels  TB
337492,douG,2009-05-03 03:17:00,2693,"Hmmmm, risotto."
337524,Spiel,2009-05-03 10:48:00,9065,  Exactly what I was going to post.
337616,Zubris21,2009-05-03 17:14:00,563,"Remember to do your research and pick the oestreich ferns, not the Bracken ferns.  Brackens contain some sort of toxin, that when eaten in large quantities can be harmful.  I've never picked either myself, but having done some research I seem to remember that one of them grows in small clumps while the other is more spread out.  Im sure there are experts around here on the subject."
337711,Stern Rules,2009-05-03 23:05:00,342,Thanks for the info guys. They were few and far between but managed to find some. Stumbled on a patch on my way back and got 2 1/2 lbs. Not too shabby.   
337930,Mr Twister,2009-05-04 11:54:00,71,Where those pic's from last year or recent?
337974,Fisherman,2009-05-04 14:12:00,7201,"Definitely worth doing the research, apparantely it takes a while for the toxin to take effect."
338066,Stern Rules,2009-05-04 17:41:00,342,This year's pics.
338112,Paully,2009-05-04 19:45:00,712,What do you do with them after you pic em'..... besides eat them? I know an area that has possibly millions of these..
338192,fish_finder,2009-05-05 00:06:00,370,Here's a little more info.......  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiddlehead_fern  tasty little things they are!
338230,ehg,2009-05-05 01:21:00,2666,Always added Black Morels to dishes prepared with those seasonal items. Haven't seen morels yet this year though. 
338345,Fisherman,2009-05-05 11:44:00,7201,"They are coming out slowly, another week or so.."
338351,tinbanger,2009-05-05 11:56:00,1028,"Bracken grow via 'runners' so the individual shoots are seperate .( Single) Fiddle heads ( Ostrich ferns) grow in clumps with several shoots together.Look for a  little mound from the previous years gowth.   Never tried morels , would they be in the same areas at fiddleheads?  TB"
338382,Fisherman,2009-05-05 14:09:00,7201,"I've found there's no hard and fast rule for morels, we find some in the hardwood stands,(maple) and have found some around pine forests."
338648,ch312,2009-05-06 02:50:00,1590,im also in brantford and know of a few honey holes within city limits. but giving out their locations would be like telling the world about a secluded little trout lake...NO DICE!  just get out and look for lower places that are usually more wet than other areas. close to swamps but not in them...  good luck
338649,KelfuN,2009-05-06 03:08:00,246,i was at duffins over the weekend and i saw an area FULL of them..it'll take you days to pick them all..
338650,Beats,2009-05-06 03:11:00,543,"My backyard in London has dozens.  We didn't plant them, a past owner must have.  Never tried eating them though.  Perhaps I should."
338655,Stern Rules,2009-05-06 03:35:00,342,I wouldn't tell where honey holes were either. I guess I'll have to go out looking for more spots. Thanks for all the info guys.
338662,KelfuN,2009-05-06 04:57:00,246,"Stern, PM me if you are willing to drive to Duffins creek for them...i'll let you know which part of the river i saw the ferns"
338887,fish_finder,2009-05-06 23:17:00,370," They're literally just about anywhere stern,  when you find them though, be sure to harvest just a couple of heads off of each crown.  If it looks like someone else beat ya to it, keep moving as you should be able to find an untouched patch nearby."
338917,BUSTER,2009-05-07 00:37:00,1336,"I drove past a house tonight in guelph , the person had a sign in the front lawn fiddleheads for sale?  i never ever heard of these before today.  learn something new , cool"
