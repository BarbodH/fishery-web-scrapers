Rushed to the water from the parking and was so excited seeing nice water color started setting up my rod and noticed my clicker is not as responsive as before ...  guess what ... it was fatigeed ... nearly broken into half  I have lost the original part list and am also wondering where I can order it  Thanks"

JOHN, NEW BRUNSWICK CANADA E2J 4C6 (506)696-8389  - STRYKER ROD & REEL - 15044 CANARY DR. SURREY, BC CANADA V3R 4V1 (604)585-6958  Probably your best bet in finding or ordering replacement parts for the reel.  In terms of getting parts in the GTA, Tom at Angling Specialties or Aikman's might be able to order and get the right parts for you.  In the meantime, you can always wrap a rubber band around your rod near the reel seat and stretch it over one of the handles on the reel...Works better than most clickers IMO."
