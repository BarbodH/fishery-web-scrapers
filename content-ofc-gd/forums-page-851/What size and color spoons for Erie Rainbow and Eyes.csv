339877,Handlebarz,2009-05-10 11:50:00,3790,I am picking up some spoons in the next couple weeks for fishing Erie from the West end this summer and was wondering what colors and size you all like for fishing the bows and eyes?  Also is there a big difference from Stinger to moonshine or sliver streak or others?   thanks for the help Mike
339902,Cudz,2009-05-10 13:09:00,2652,Send Dave Mercer a PM. Did you see his show on Erie bows salmon and eyes.  It was insane.  I am sure he could point you in the right direction.
339916,Greencoachdog,2009-05-10 13:35:00,8163,There's a rather large and unsightly truck driver on this board that swears by the Watermelson spoon.  
339923,LeXXington,2009-05-10 13:50:00,1928,Watermellon and blueberry muffin for spoones.. For eye's can't beat the old worm harness
340190,Wendel,2009-05-11 02:20:00,213,"Hey Mike, I've done quite well on Greasy Chicken Wing, Monkey Puke, Watermelon. Silver Green/Silver Blue are all quite productive. As for size, I get the 28 or magnum size(Those are northern king, but will give you an idea of the size) You can never have too many of each kind either, some days they will only bite one colour type!  Most of my spoons are Northern King, I have some stingers as well, they all work, just have to be doing the right thing in the right place at the right time!"
340213,taper,2009-05-11 04:39:00,611,"Mike all the colours mentioned so far produced for me. As far as size is concerned get a few of each, some days you can't buy a hit on a large spoon other days that's the only thing that will work. Also pick your self up a couple ripplin red fins they were really hot last year."
340216,Dnthmn,2009-05-11 05:49:00,128,Had a lot of luck with a purple/black spoons for bows last year when the sun was out. They are Northern Kings. If you go to the website they are listed as bw-1 & pt.
340253,Uncle Buck,2009-05-11 13:01:00,1000,blue/silver riplin redfin Mike...
340432,Sandbag,2009-05-11 22:06:00,533,I concur with the worm harness in monkey puke or blueberry muffin for the eyes.  Cheers  Craig
340436,DRIFTER_016,2009-05-11 22:17:00,10439,"For eye's I always did well with perch or chartreuse Ripplin' Redfins sporting a night crawler. For bows silver/blue, silver/green, silver/purple, firetiger, strawberry shortcake, monkey puke, watermellon and clown are all good colours. I have also had good success with Rapala J11's and J13's in blue/silver and gold/orange."
340437,Billy Bob,2009-05-11 22:20:00,5865,I agree with just about every color already mentioned but as also said WORM HARNESS have out fished all other baits combined the last 3 - 4 years. Go Figure...........
340455,dave524,2009-05-11 22:52:00,4508,"My go to lure for yellow pickerel on Erie has been jointed Canadian Wigglers, firetiger, chartreuse/green or Jack of Diamonds. You can hang half a crawler off the front treble if things are slow."
