339397,Steel28,2009-05-08 17:54:00,160,"Looks like it's time to get my first baitcaster reel, any suggestions which one would the best in $200-$250 range? I'm planning to use it for throwing cranks for eyes and pike.  Thanks in advance"
339398,MCTFisher9120,2009-05-08 17:57:00,3761,I do not know from first hand but i have heard from many many people that the Shimano Curado is a amazing reel. I'm guessing somebody will recommended it as it's a great deal for $179.99
339400,BillM,2009-05-08 18:05:00,17367,Curado is a good reel along with the Citica..  I don't think you can go wrong with any baitcaster from a number of companies...  They all make a decent product.
339401,Whitespinnerbait,2009-05-08 18:28:00,2038,"It doesn't matter what Brand of reel you get Whatsoever aslong as its a Shimano ....Curado or a Citica ,,"
339402,highdrifter,2009-05-08 18:33:00,2534,"250 bones?!  I'd say spend a few extra bucks and go with a Calcutta!  Eye candy wise, they're real purty, they'll take beating and they're a great all around reel for any application.  If I had that kinda scratch, first choice would be the Calcutta.  The Curado D would be my second.  cheers HD"
339404,Steel28,2009-05-08 18:39:00,160,"Thanks guys!  Fidel, I'm leaning towards Calcutta 200B."
339405,highdrifter,2009-05-08 18:49:00,2534, You lucky sod!  Drool...
339407,Spiel,2009-05-08 19:00:00,9065,"I have a Calcutta TE, 200DC, very sweet reel. But my Quantum Energy PT's get more use and are far more affordable, definitely worth looking at."
339410,Steel28,2009-05-08 19:11:00,160, Thanks bro
339411,Steel28,2009-05-08 19:13:00,160," Hey Spiel, 200DC cost almost as much as my Ang spec    Will take a look at Quantum PT as well, thanks as always."
339416,Garry2Rs,2009-05-08 19:45:00,1425,"I have owned a Curado, seven Calcutta's aand three Chronarch's. They are all good reels that you can have repaired, if neccessary, in Peterborough. That's worth a lot!"
339426,mepps,2009-05-08 20:26:00,1301,Mosdef go for the Calcutta!  I got teh 251 for $250 a few years back and its been very good to me!
339440,salmon,2009-05-08 22:09:00,334,Shimano Low profile: Citica or Curado Round: Cardiff or Calcutta B series  Daiwa LP: Tierra or HSTA  Abu LP: REVO SX  Jose
339686,cpguy29,2009-05-09 20:32:00,148,Curado! Have fun!
339691,Cudz,2009-05-09 20:58:00,2652,"You just thanked him for calling you a sod.  That is funny!  Curado, low pro and lighter."
339693,Bondar,2009-05-09 21:01:00,817,"Revo SX is my choice , I like it but dont have much experience with anything else LOL oh except for a Revo S"
339720,gogu392,2009-05-09 23:03:00,142,Shimano Curado 200E - right handle 201E - left handle
339820,Steel28,2009-05-10 03:01:00,160,"Thanks for all responses guys, got one more question though..is it true that right handed caster are better served by right handed reels?"
339851,Ben_Daniels,2009-05-10 06:10:00,435,I would definitely recommend a Shimano Cruxis. I've used this reel for the past couple years and think it is awesome! Ive gone back and bought 2 more at like $130 each. I just saw it on sale at Tackle warehouse for $70! Here's the link   http://www.tacklewarehouse.com/descpageRLCSHIMANO-SHCR.html  If I were you I would buy two of these for less than the price your looking to spend. Great reels in my opinion!  -Ben
340084,theRJ,2009-05-10 22:21:00,55,"Right hand cast go with a left hand reel. Not having to switch hands is great.  I would second the Energy PT, great reel. As for the calcutta I hate round reels but that is a personal thing.   RJ"
340218,Ben_Daniels,2009-05-11 06:05:00,435,"I cast with my right and it just doesn't feel right with a left hand reel. No lefties and lots of switchin hands for me RJ lol, how ya been? Haven't seen you out since the opener last year?  -Ben"
