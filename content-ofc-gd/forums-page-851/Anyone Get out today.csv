I believe these are just pop ups because if you look at the radar, its clear one minute, then storms the next.  I'll just go shopping.  I'll sacrifice"

339648,JohnF,2009-05-09 18:44:00,3494,"Mid-afternoon, it's getting dark, windy and cold here. At least I had a long enuf dry spell to cut the lawn. Think I finished just in time.  Now I have a good excuse to stay in & replace a few crappy trebles with the Gamakatsus (sp?) that I just picked up.  JF"
339651,Joeytier,2009-05-09 18:51:00,3990,"I waited until the storm was practically right over my head today.  Why does that always happen? ""Just one more cast.  I mean it this time."" ""MY BAITS TANGLED THAT ONE DOESN'T COUNT"" ""I JUST HAD A HIT I HAVE TO CAST BACK!"""
