339132,lew,2009-05-07 21:34:00,12766,"Well, it's finally that beautiful time of year again, the van is packed and me & the Mrs are outta here tomorrow morning at 8 A.M. for our little hide-away in the Kawarthas and we won't be back home again till mid-October  Nuthin for the 2 of us to do for the next 5 1/2 months but enjoy my new boat, plenty of musky fish'n, or just lay around under the shade trees and enjoy life.  I'm going to Lakair for 7 days in June for the g2g and I'll see a bunch of you there,  then a few of us have another 7 day Nippissing trip booked at a different location in August. There'll also be a couple more musky trips to both the Ottawa & St. Lawrence Rivers and where ever else the roads lead me.  I'll probably have to come back to the Smoke a couple times taking care of business, but they'll just be quick trips and I'll head back north as fast as possible.  I seldom take fish pictures anymore, but I always have my camera just incase.  So have a great summer everyone and stay safe on the water and I'll see y'all in the fall"
