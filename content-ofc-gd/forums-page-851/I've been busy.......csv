339253,johnnyb,2009-05-08 02:53:00,3413,"Sheee-yoot!!  Awesome stuff, man...thanks for the inspiration!!!"
339301,Spiel,2009-05-08 12:31:00,9065," Well I was refering to ""whities"" but hell BC sturgeon sounds like a ""reel"" blast, have fun with that man. Those other whities will still be there when you get back."
339367,Sinker,2009-05-08 15:42:00,8692, I'm hoping fun  is going to be an understatement!!!  I want one to rip my arms off  Sinker
339669,Joeytier,2009-05-09 20:05:00,3990,Nice going.  You've been getting into some great numbers of quality fish.  Thanks for sharing.
339703,Sinker,2009-05-09 21:48:00,8692," Thanks bud, your not doing to shabby yourself!!  Sinker"
339797,Jigger,2009-05-10 02:02:00,1237,"Sweet Jeebus man, I was wondering where you were hiding out! Not a moment wasted eh? Nice going. You making any jerky out of the gobblers?"
339811,Sinker,2009-05-10 02:29:00,8692," Nope, no jerkey. They're just too good to turn into jerky  We ate the tom, it fed 10 people, and lots left over for a big pot of soup. One of the best birds I've eaten. I'd buy cheap turkey to make jerky  Sinker"
338966,Sinker,2009-05-07 03:17:00,8692,"Yep, spring is here, that's for sure.  I've been busy, as I am every year at this time. Turkeys, panfish, and trout......life is good.  I started with the perch. and did very well with them. We got into some great fish, and crazy numbers. I didn't take many pictures of them unfortunatly.  Next up was turkeys. I headed out with a buddy of mine and tagged out in two days. First day got me a 16 lb. jake, and my buddy got a 21lb tom. A true double to start the season......sweet! Jake....        Our double....    Second day, my buddy was tagged out, so he called for me. Had a lot of birds work us, but none that I could get a shot on. We had a pair of toms in range, but they wouldn't separate enough for a shot.  Finally, had to let them work away from us, and do a quick run around the property to cut them off on their way to a feeding area. We got set up just in time for me to whack this big fella.        Pretty feathers on them.....      Heres a s hot from the first day. Our two birds are there, dead, and there are 6 more legal birds in the shot. they hung around for at least an hour after we shot.    These guys were also in the field in the other direction.    Next up on the spring list is usually crappies, but most years I do this in between turkey hunting. No time for slabs yet, but they're gonna get it tomorrow. Instead of crappies, this week I noticed a lot of bugs coming out. It must be trout time!!!!!  First up was specks. We arrived at my favourite speck hole to this.....    We said hello to the locals.....    And started our first troll. I had  silver/red worm harness dragging behind the boat. On the first point, whammo....fish on. It took less than 5 mins to get my first fish.    I swung the boat around and hit the same structure again, and it was a repeat. I had my dinner    My buddy was having troubles in the hook set department,and couldn't land a fish to save his life. Luckily, I pulled through and got us these 4 for dinner.    We were off the water around 11, had lunch and refreshments, then headed to lake #2. Not a hit, not a rise, nothing at that lake, so we headed back home to eat our trout, and kill a 26er of gibsons around the campfire.  Next day, up early, and on the water for first light. Today was a new thing for us both. Inland rainbows. Neither of us had fished them before, so we figured what the heck, lets giver a go. Boy, did we have fun. We found the fish feeding on the surface. I was kicking myself for not bringing the fly rod!! It would have been chaotic with a light fly rod in there today!! The fish were over deep water, anywhere from 30-60fow, but feeding off the surface. With no flies, we needed to find a pattern that would get these guys. I kept my same set up with the silver/red spinner, but took off all the weight, and only let out a short cast behind the boat. It was game over for them bows after that.......we had a blast!!!!!! Landed easily over 20 fish, lost at least that many more. They were on fire!!! I got my first,  my PB and the most inland bows I've ever seen in my life. Truely a day to remember!! I guess you could call it EPIC        Our take home    Did I mention I love this time of year   Slabs are gonna get a beating tomorrow  Sinker"
338973,RuNnYoOzE,2009-05-07 03:31:00,270,love to try wild turkey ....are they more leaner than grain fed?
338988,Jet,2009-05-07 03:56:00,364,Thanks for the great pics. I hope to get out there and hunt this year too!
338989,Stern Rules,2009-05-07 04:01:00,342,That's one beautiful bird and nice trout. Nice pics.
338991,e-z-out,2009-05-07 04:04:00,1052,you're going after slabs tomorrow lucky you. I have to wait tll this weekend for that.  Good luck and stay dry it's going to rain from what i hear.
339000,wolfmachine,2009-05-07 10:17:00,89,sweet report. those trout look tastey! LOL at picture of dead turkey heads with ammunition lol           hahahah
339003,Greencoachdog,2009-05-07 10:56:00,8163,Those Turkey's aren't nearly that ugly when you buy them in the store.... and there sure does seem to be a lot of them all bunched up there... were you hunting in a pen???  Those are some real purdy Troots!!!... how do you cook them?  Excellent report and pics Sinker!!!
339004,danbo,2009-05-07 10:57:00,2646,"Awesome brother! U sure are livin' the Good Life!! Cheers, Dan'l"
339009,tinbanger,2009-05-07 11:21:00,1028,"Them s good eatin !   Nice report , love that feather close up .  TB"
339012,Spiel,2009-05-07 11:33:00,9065,That's the kind of busy anyone could be happy with. I guess you'll soon be throwing whities into the mix.
339016,solopaddler,2009-05-07 11:41:00,8605,That's awesome man!  Can't believe those turkeys hung around with 2 of them shot LOL!  I remember years ago I fished a rainbow lake in the Haliburton wildlife reserve and encountered the exact same scenario. They were boiling and rising everywhere over deep water and I had no fly rod.  I ultimately threaded a nightcrawler onto my hook with no weight and lobbed it out into the rising fish working it back slowly. That worked as well and pretty similar to your story.
339020,corvette1,2009-05-07 11:52:00,1765,awesome report what a spring grand slam
339021,Jay T,2009-05-07 11:52:00,282,"That is some great hunting and fishing, congrats. Looks like you will be eating good."
339027,alphaalpha,2009-05-07 12:12:00,475,"very nice report, those are the outtings that make up for all the days of skunk stench!"
339031,trapshooter,2009-05-07 12:30:00,1234,"Sinker, you sly dog!!  That's some awesome fishing and hunting.  Congrats buddy."
339038,bigugli,2009-05-07 13:09:00,6138,"Nothing like keeping busy, is there?  Great report."
339063,highdrifter,2009-05-07 16:05:00,2534,Now if only you could get paid..  Great report brotha!!  cheers HD
339070,drwxr,2009-05-07 16:20:00,453,"wow sinker, good job man, i see you had some productive trips. congrats. with all the turkey reports i might try it out next year."
339080,Sinker,2009-05-07 16:37:00,8692," They are very lean, but awesome eating. The tom fed 7 adults and 3 kids, and still enough left overs for sandwhiches and such, then a big ole pot of turkey soup!! Even my wife loved it, and she doesn't do well with wild game!    Glen, this property was stacked with birds. We had 18 legal birds in front of us the first morning. They didn't budge, even after we both shot a bird. They're really wary, but pretty dumb..... LOL The specks were just rolled in flour,and fried in butter. Easy sleasy.........the bows are marinated and ready for the BBQ tonight for dinner    Well, I won't get at the whities until after the long weekend, but if your talking white sturgeon, well, that's next week in BC    Its quite the site to seem them rising like that. They were coming up right at the boat even........I was in shock!! They didn't hesitate to smash our spinners though. You could see them fighting over which one was going to get it......unreal. We were trolling fast, and the spinners were no more than 50ft back. You'd see a boil, then a bow come flying out of the water........friggen awesome!!!  Sinker"
339082,Guest gbfisher,2009-05-07 16:41:00,0,Good Luck with the Sturgesses....
339088,NAC,2009-05-07 17:27:00,369,Great stuff there Sinker!  Team 8!!  Sound like a killer May for you fishing.
339096,LeXXington,2009-05-07 17:47:00,1928,"WOW, you do have the life  turkey and fish dinner."
339100,Leecher,2009-05-07 18:16:00,7832,"Great report and pics Sinker  That is one hell of a great season starter!!!!  Congratulations Just doesn't get any better than that and like you said at the beginning, life is good!!! I also liked to close up shots of the feathers  Tell me, how many birds are you allowed to take for the season??  Again great job and thanks for sharing Leechman"
339112,Sinker,2009-05-07 19:28:00,8692," Thanks Leechman,  Your allowed 2 birds per hunter, but only one per day.  Usually turkey hunting takes up my fishing time, but this year has been a lucky one for me  Sinker"
339143,irishfield,2009-05-07 22:08:00,26272,Great stuff fella !!! What no tourney sign on the gobblers....
