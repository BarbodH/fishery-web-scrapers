339681,silverstreak,2009-05-09 20:25:00,146,Hit up a trib yesterday and was surprised at the larger fish that were around. Only managed a few average size steelies on previous outings.Only goes to show that ya never know. Fish hit a unscented worm 
339700,mpagnan,2009-05-09 21:20:00,84,"Nice catch,  I was wondering how you rigges your pinkie, what size it was and how it was fished?  Thanks,  MJP"
339709,rbaquial,2009-05-09 22:18:00,968," I'm guessing rig it right down the middle of the Pinkie... Almost like a ""Wacky"" rig?"
339711,silverstreak,2009-05-09 22:19:00,146,"Pags There are a number of ways to rig a Pinky. My fav involves a little work however you will not lose as many worms while fighting fish. You will need a sewing needle (about 2 inches)and some small beads. Start by tying the needle onto your fishing line then thread your worm onto the needle about 2/3 of the way. Next - cut the needle off then add your small bead and tie on your hook. You could also use jig heads however the worm will have more action if rigged as above. I do not like the whacky style of rigging simply because I use larger,thicker worms plus you could go through a lot of woms this way. Simply fish worms under a float. Hope this helps "
339713,rbaquial,2009-05-09 22:22:00,968,Thanks for sharing that style of rig - I'm definitely going to give it a shot on my next outing!
339714,Guest gbfisher,2009-05-09 22:28:00,0,Was on a GB trib last weekend and pulled 15 out of one hole. Not to mention the amount of fish that were still spawning. Good job..
