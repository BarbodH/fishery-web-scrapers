314555,Weeds,2009-03-07 20:25:00,782,I can only imagine how happy you must be. Congats! I've been fishing a few spots along the T.O. waterfront for a good 6 or seven years chasing pike and never caught a single one! Thank god I moved away from those cursed shores to a land where musky are as plentiful as the birds in the sky. Lousy pike....Actually I'm kind of hoping to get down to Toronto for a day and take another kick at the can.
314557,Victor,2009-03-07 20:37:00,1609,congrats anton! I still remember the day that I caught my first TO pike ... it was just awesome.
314566,diggyj,2009-03-07 21:20:00,548,Great report Anton. That truly captured the essence of what fishing is all about. First of many more to come.  Dirk.....
314573,Dusky,2009-03-07 21:43:00,310,Your persistence paid off!!  Congrates on your first Pike!  And this remind me that I still have to catch my first
314591,Anton Kanagasuntheri,2009-03-07 22:30:00,160,Thanks guys... your replys makes it all worh it!!!
314594,irishfield,2009-03-07 22:33:00,26272,Some nice fishies there for sure Anton and thanks for sharing your story!  When you get used to them toothy critters and gain some confidence handling them.. lose the boga or pass it to another novice !
314841,snag,2009-03-08 16:51:00,1932,"  Sorry it took so long to reply Anton!!  But...  Look pal,  I don't want to be a part of your shenanigans.  Just because we share the same birthday (for real everyone!) and we both like to fish, Doesn't mean I want any part of your amazing story.  I'm not worthy Anton.  That was a great read!  You totally brought me back to the excitement of my 1st T.O. pike!  I was also surfing when I came across this site by accident and saw a report from FHR, LUCID and HIGHDRIFTER.  The rest is downhill.  I'm very happy for ya buddy!   "

314294,Anton Kanagasuntheri,2009-03-07 03:51:00,160,"Hi Guys and Gals,  After trying for almost 2 years finally I got my fist pike! It all started about 2 springs ago (I think), I was searching the net for Piking techniques and I came about this board. I read the thread from “Snag” about his adventures with urban piking… I was hooked!  I became a member of this board that day. I have to be honest, my intentions were to quickly learn the methods, tricks, tips and score some nice pike grounds to start my adventure  . BUT, what was a quick pass by through this board lured me deep into it and made me different person. I realized, how hard these anglers in this board tried to hike and scout out their own locations (well most of you anyways) and how passionate they were about fishing.  I stayed, and I learned, I read many topics and when ever I had something to contribute I did. So I took on a new spirit, and a new challenge to seek and find my own spots and my own methods while incorporating what this board had to offer me. I am greatly thankful to all the members specially Snag (I am a big fan  ).  When the day came last week, I gathered my rod, various xraps, husky jerks and some spoons and headed out to the one spot I knew which will produce my first ever Pike. Over the past 2 years, I have scouted many locations and this was my favorite. So I arrived there around 10:30 am. The sun was out but it was somewhat cold, I parked the car and immediately ran to the waterside to check weather it was frozen. It was!! All but some, a small strip size of a tennis court length. I was disappointed  , but did not give up, after praying to the gods I started to cast!.  After about 20 minutes, I hooked pretty well into a log while I was retrieving!!! I took a deep breath and started to reel in the log (I did not want to loose a $10 Xrap). When I got it almost to the shore, the darn log just slowly moved to the opposite direction!!! I froze… it was a PIKE!! And there in that very moment, I realized, I’ve finally done it! Of course I was alone and scared to death unhooking the monster quickly to release and realizing after releasing that I forgot to take a picture!!!  Fear not my friends, since that day I have gone back 4 times and I have caught 3 or more on each trip. Here are some worthy picts. My hands stop shaking after while and I was able to take some good pictures. Finally, I like to thank all the members who have been helpful and encouraged me not to give up. And a special thanks to Snag  P.S. No pike or fingers were harmed! lol   "

Somehow you captured the essence of fishing in your post, and said things we all feel are important. And you found success!  Congratulations, your efforts paid off.  Stay away from Snag, tho, that chile is strange."
