339641,Joeytier,2009-05-09 18:27:00,3990,"After seeing the weather report, I couldn't pass up walleye fishing.  And the weather did not disappoint.  Light winds, overcast and pi$$ing rain most of the morning was how she went.  It only took about twenty minutes for my side to go off.  A nice two and a half pound eye on a perch walleye diver spit it at the boat after a few violent head shakes.  After that, the trolling bite went dead, so we decided to look for some weed beds.  We finally found something to our liking in about 10 - 12.  We managed to pop one nice 3 lb walleye, two nice OOS largemouth and an absolutely ENORMOUS sheepshead.  I've caught plenty of them before, and this was easily the biggest I have ever seen.  I kept hoping it was an eye but deep down I knew it wasn't.  The bigger of the two largemouth:   The gigantic sheepshead, weighing in at 14 pounds flat.   And of course, dinner.   And I managed to lose two crankbaits to what I can only assume were pike."
