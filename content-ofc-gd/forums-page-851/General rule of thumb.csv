339551,Kenny G,2009-05-09 12:27:00,118,"Is their a general rule of thumb for knowing what size hooks go with what size worms? I just bought some 7"" black worms and have 5/0 Gamakatsu hooks but they are too small. Mmmmm.... Kenny G."
339563,jediangler,2009-05-09 13:11:00,1923,5/0 hooks will work fine with 7 inch worms. I only use 4/0 for worms that size.
339564,Kenny G,2009-05-09 13:13:00,118,Do you put the hook threw the middle or the end? When I put them threw the end it looks like a fish could miss the hook? Mmmm...... Kenny G.
339568,Beans,2009-05-09 13:21:00,3339,Most fish will strike a lure head first except pesky panfish and pickerel...
339573,jediangler,2009-05-09 13:34:00,1923,"What are you fishing for with 7"" black worms this time of year?"
339575,Kenny G,2009-05-09 13:36:00,118,Pike and walleye opener next weekend. Worms are only one of many lures I will be washing in lake Muskoka. Kenny G.
339581,bushart,2009-05-09 14:36:00,2628,I'm not a pro or even a wannabe--But---My experience has me using smaller baits in spring------a lot of baitfish is still pretty small--match the hatch grasshopper
339584,bassjnkie,2009-05-09 14:44:00,1101,"I sometimes use a 1/0 Gammy wide gap with a 7"" worm for Bass. It will sink a little slower."
339611,MCTFisher9120,2009-05-09 16:17:00,3761,"Not sure on the worm your using but when using Dingers (cheaper Sinkos) Texas rigged I like to use a 4/0 hook on a 5"" & 6"" bait but on anything bigger a 5/0 will be sufficient and a good match for what your doing."
339661,Kenny G,2009-05-09 19:18:00,118,Thanks Gents for the advice. Kenny G.
