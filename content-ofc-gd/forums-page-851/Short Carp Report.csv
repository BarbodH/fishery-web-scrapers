339473,dsn,2009-05-09 00:45:00,1018,Second day out carping. After seeing CCMT's carp report I decided to check my local hole. Normally I don't fish for Carp this early usually Mid May to the end of May. But they were in. Very sluggish on the take thats for sure. I tried using the 2.5 ounce lead but they didn't hit it hard enough.And no runs. I had to watch the line intensly for line movement while usinga single split shot and hair rig. With 8lb Berkey Transition. I tried the bait-runner with 30lb Power Pro but I guess the line was too visible after using it for a few seasons it turned light greenish and highly visible from what I could tell above water. Here are some pics            So much fun with light tackel  DSN

339558,kenzy31,2009-05-09 12:53:00,261,"nice pics! as for your Power Pro, try perminate green marker on the last 20 feet.  heard it works well"
339593,Victor,2009-05-09 15:19:00,1609,"Good to see you back denison! That seemed like a good sized fish, it's sometimes hard to tell because I can only reference the size with the piece of maize lol"
339617,MJL,2009-05-09 16:33:00,2427,You're missing too many hits because you're not using your carp rod...Gotta go for the full Euro experience  Great catch
339654,Twocoda,2009-05-09 19:04:00,4130,i like what you were trying to do with the pics....get the fish on camera while fighting ...not an easy task to say the least....ive been trying REAL hard to get a bow dancing to no success but i did manage to get a carp while i was fighting him.... 
339937,dsn,2009-05-10 14:16:00,1018," The Key is to once you set the hook !! Reach for your digital and bend down close to the water, while holding your rod tip high. Make sure the digital is set to Tele-Photo and the shutter speed is set to a high speed to freeze action. I set the rapid firing setting also so you hold the button down while the camera clicks away just in case the fish takes a jump out of the water !!  DSN"
