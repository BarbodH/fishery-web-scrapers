All this sun and warmth is taking it's toll on our ice....................yeah, yeah, I know Boo Hoo!!!! Yesterday was my last day to drive my truck on the lake this winter as the landings are getting sketchy.  :'( Now I'm going to have to haul my gear on foot, DOH!!!!!  Here's the approach to the lake yesterday. It's starting to look a little soft in places.    Luckily there is safe ice on both sides of this soft section to gain access to the safe 3 foot plus ice beyond.    A random shot on the way to my favorite lake.    Arctic Ice Porn!!!
