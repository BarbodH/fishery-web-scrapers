DONT! lol  They had a small 14 foot alum Boat.. Had the rear hatch open and waves were coming in the back!  He should of dragged the boat up as far as he could before hand loading it expecially when you have a launch that is dirt!  Good thing for a local person that used his truck to assist with pulling the van out of its situation..  I shot this today in Gores Landing, on Rice Lake "

If you're a virgin, once a year launcher, or just plain inept BOZO.. please step to the back of the line so the folks that know what they're doing can get their boat in the water without having to wait/LTAO at you for being a dumb"
340237,Billy Bob,2009-05-11 11:53:00,5865,For MANY years we would have about 8 - 12 guys every year sleep in our vans at Godfrey Point on Oneida Lake for the opening weekend of walleye season. We would get out early (4:30am) and fish to light then come back to Godfrey Point (very small harbor) for breakfast and the ALWAYS entertaining launchers there. We would set up our folding chairs and coolers with adult refreshments and enjoy the fun. We were never disappointed. Sometimes this was as much fun as the fishing. Over the years I had seen it all at the launch site. I miss that now that I'm older and no longer willing to sleep in a van for the weekend..... getting old sucks..
