339682,Fang,2009-05-09 20:25:00,1330,Hikers Haven in Oakville has a big tent sale this weekend. Loads of yaks and canoes out front today
339717,jediangler,2009-05-09 22:38:00,1923,"Don't buy anything until you try out at least a half dozen different yaks. Things like your height and weight, where you intend to fish and how you intend to transport it, all have to be taken in to account. If you can rent or go to some demo days you can narrow down what works best for you. Last week there was a demo by Adventure Guide at Laurel creek conservation area. The week before that Swift had kayaks and canoes for demo rides at Guelph lake conservation area. Check out Yakfisher.net, join the forum, and tell the gang your size and type of fishing you intend to do as well as your budget restraints. There is a huge amount of experienced yakfishers on there that will be happy to help you out. Many of them have more than one yak and would probably let you try one out. Many OFC'ers on there as well like Crazyhook, Pure, Nomad, Ricoboxing and many others."

339736,fishing n autograph,2009-05-09 23:51:00,2540,thanks for the info guys!  Hey Jedi....Can I borrow yours????
339744,charlied,2009-05-10 00:18:00,584,well if your ever down near Fort Erie..you could take mine out for a test drive on lake erie.  Then we could chat and I could pick your brain about Police work.
339747,jediangler,2009-05-10 00:23:00,1923,"I would lend you my old one but my daughter has claimed it as her own now. If you search ""kayak"" on kijiji they sell a Canadian made kayak by Clearwater in Kitchener called the Iqaluit that has a large cockpit, good for fishing, for $599. It is a sit inside kayak. Not sure if you want a sit in or a sit on top model.  http://kitchener.kijiji.ca/c-buy-and-sell-...QAdIdZ126229501"
339755,charlied,2009-05-10 00:29:00,584,"wow....$599 for a kayak....ouch.  I bought mine at dicks sporting goods in Buffalo for $329US, about $400 canadian."
339770,jediangler,2009-05-10 01:06:00,1923,"The sit on top style that are popular with most fishermen start around $900 and rise all the way to $2000, and used ones are hard to come by. I like the sit in style because I like my butt to be dry when I fish   ."
339800,charlied,2009-05-10 02:06:00,584,"Ya I like the sit in ones too for the same reason, try and keep the water out.  The opening in my kayak is quit large, even a fat guy could fit in my Yak.  Don't know how balanced it would be with a big guy in it, but I find it perfect for me and I am 5'8 and about 200 pounds.  But aren't the sit on top ones hard to add stuff to like rod holders?"
339817,Crazyhook,2009-05-10 02:54:00,1154,"hey man, I wish you were closer I could lend you one of mine... if you have any questions PM me. Check out a demo day and try a few out before you buy. They all do the same thing but some are more comfortable... Check out the new Ultimate fishing guide book at Chapters as well... good read with alot of good info"
