I left the lake at 11am thoroughly soaked. They were small fish(23-24 inches) but very chunky for their length. Must be all those perch they have been eating. The 24"" was a female and still full of eggs. Anybody have any thoughts on this. Also, the launch in Gilford at the end of Hwy #89 is in poor condition. The high water and soft mud makes it difficult to get in and out. Having a 4x4 is helpful.  I will be out tomorrow again."
