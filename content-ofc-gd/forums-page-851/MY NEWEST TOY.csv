The deploy button alone seems to be worth the extra bucks over the powerdrive, just push the lever in, press down and the thing just glides out of the cradle...sweet!  Only seven more sleeps till she hits te water....hmmmmmm.....now all i need is a hd Lowrance GPS combo unit so i can hook my trusty old X67c to the front and use the big GPS with me by the tiller! then i woke up from my dream....lol any ways....here's my new addition....     "

339909,Greencoachdog,2009-05-10 13:22:00,8163,"  That's what the tourney is all about Simon!... The ""Trash Talk""!!!  .... there aren't any prizes except ""Bragging Rights""!   Try not to be so darned polite and join in!!!"

339978,SlowPoke,2009-05-10 15:55:00,2984," LOL, never mind G, he's just a redbloke  The Terrova is a sweet peice of equipment. I'd have one on the bow this year myself if I didn't blow the boat budget on frivolous things such as a floor!"
340251,RangerGuy,2009-05-11 12:47:00,564,You will love this motor.. I put an 80# Terrova on my 17' Ranger Tiller last year.. Ran bottom bouncers all may long weekend and still had 1/2 my battery juice left when we got home after 4 days of fishing!  Will move my boat 2+ mph into wind.. motor is awesome!
