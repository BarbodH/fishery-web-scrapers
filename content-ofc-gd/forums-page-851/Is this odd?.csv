He kept the fish and when he cleaned it, it was full of roe.  It was caught near the mouth of the river.  Isn't it a bit late to be just entering the river now??  Maybe that is normal for trout up there.  Surface water temp in the lake was anywhere from 6-9 degrees and the river was about 13 degrees."

There is also a few ""under development"" programs to produce fall run rainbows that operate in that area. The sandfield hatchery release some summer spawn bow in the mid 80's as well."

Some are ahead of the pack, the bulk are right in the middle, and just like in life some bring up the rear. On top of that some just may not spawn at all, for various reasons, and will be reabsorbing their eggs."
