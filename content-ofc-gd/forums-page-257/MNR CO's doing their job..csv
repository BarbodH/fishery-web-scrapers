Wow that's odd.  Most CO's I encounter out on Simcoe are really nice.  I've forgotten my ID in the truck before, he just took down all my info and that was that."

When its a blatant abuse of the laws half measures as in this case make me wonder why we have laws at all. And CO's for that matter."

As a matter of fact; at one time the fine for not having your license with you was higher than the fine for not having a license at all."
