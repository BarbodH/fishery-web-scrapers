Anyone  have some first hand recommendations?  Will also be taking some surf fishing gear, and spinning setup for fishing from shore."
832009,SmokestackLightnin,2014-01-22 13:20:00,390,"Mike is the guy, he runs out of Cap Cana.  I have used/known him for years.  He has a policy of 100% release of all billfish.  Keep in mind that all fish that are keepers are property of the crew but they filet and give you plenty of fish to take back to your resort for your own consumption.  Pick up and delivery to all resorts.  And you can ask him about the surf fishing and his recommendations as well.  Here is a link to his site and FB page:  http://www.mikesmarina.info/  https://www.facebook.com/Mike.Fisher.PuntaCana  "

I used him for a shared charter (other clients cancelled leaving me the whole boat for the day) when I was last in the DR and had an amazing time, while it was not billfish season, I had a blast with all the Mahi Mahi I could handle. As stated above the crew keep the fish you catch. Bring the Sea sickness meds!  G"
