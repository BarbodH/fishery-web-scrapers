834068,bass_man,2014-02-02 13:20:00,43,On 90% of my fishing spinner baits of various sized are my lures of choice but over the years I have been very successful with Colorado bladed spinners but not so much with willow leaf.  Anyone else have a preference or an opinion as to why this should happen?  Jim
834069,BillM,2014-02-02 13:23:00,17367,"Depends on the fishing conditions for me..  If I want to stay up high in the water column and have a slower presentation, then Colorado blade it is..   If I want to burn, then I'll run a willowleaf in that same situation..   If I wanna fish some deeper weed edges or drop offs, nothing beats a slow rolled spinnerbait with willowleaf blades."
834070,Terry,2014-02-02 13:23:00,14456,speed and how dirty the water is and activity level of the fish all play a part in which blade works best
834080,Andy,2014-02-02 14:13:00,330,"I am the opposite. I definitely prefer willow leaf spinner  baits for everything from 1/4 oz to 1 1/2 oz sizes. In my mind they shed weeds easier, pull easier, maybe run a little deeper. I like that they are more subtle and don't thump as hard. And I like them better for trolling. Does blade type really make a difference ? Maybe a little from day to day, but probably not as much as we think. You just use what feels right. Andy"
834097,OhioFisherman,2014-02-02 17:07:00,6623,"I think getting the lure in the fishes face might have a lot to do with it. My biggest walleye 28 inches came on a slow rolled spinner bait with Colorado blades, the very next cast got me a 14-15 inch Crappie. Stupid fish! It's a bass lure! LOL"
834119,aplumma,2014-02-02 19:08:00,6896,I match the bait fish if they are thin then I use a willow if they are wide then a colorado. I over ride this with water clarity willow for clear and thumpers for murky.   Art

834224,fishindevil,2014-02-03 09:03:00,6254,"Colorado for shallower presentation Indiana blades for medium depth and a deep or faster presentation a willow !!!! I mostly use Colorado and Indiana blades on my worm harnesses !!!!! They both put out a lot more ""thump "" and vibration than a willow blade they are more visual and make less vibration than the other blades !!!!"
834238,Lape0019,2014-02-03 14:17:00,647,"I use willow leaf spinners about 90% of the time. They are a confidence lure for me and have always produced well for me. If the water is stained, I will switch to 1 willow blade and 1 Colorado blade for the extra thump so the fish can find it.  Adam"
834243,bigmac1984,2014-02-03 14:59:00,193,"I have found that for LMB I use Colorado blades most of the time, I find they like the thumping blades and the slower moving bait. For SMB I use the willowleaf and reel that spinnerbait about as fast as I can. I find the SMB like the bait to be burning since they love to chase bait down.  Water clarity also comes into play, when murky I use colorado, when clear, its willowleaf."
834244,mike rousseau,2014-02-03 15:16:00,4661,I use the baits with both if I can  A small Colorado on up the shaft and a big willow on the end.... One silver and one gold....  For depth control I have different weights....
834335,bare foot wader,2014-02-03 23:10:00,1354,"one of my favourite spinnerbaits is the BPS model with an interchangeable clevis...I'm always tinkering with blades, bending blades, drilling offset holes to mount them, adding a strip of flash, etc, etc  some days it just doesn't matter if the bite is hot, but there are the days that tinkering pays off big time"
834366,bass_man,2014-02-04 00:31:00,43,"Thanks guys, I thought that there may be more to it than just dumb luck. I think I will go ahead and try a few willow blade spinners this year. What do you think about a number 3 willow leaf on a safety pin with a 1/4 oz jig and a twister tail.  Jim"

834411,fishindevil,2014-02-04 07:49:00,6254,For spinnerbaits I like to use the titanium baits and they have a small number 2 Colorado blade at the bottom and a large willow blade on the top of the wire !!!! They work awesome !!!!

Jim  I run crappie spinnerbaits for bass when the conditions call for it, they absolutely destroy them, lol!"
