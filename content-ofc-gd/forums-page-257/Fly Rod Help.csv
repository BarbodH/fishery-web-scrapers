833835,strik,2014-02-01 01:08:00,175,"Hi everyone need some help ..  Dad's turning 60 we are thinking of getting him a new rod and reel.  For a couple years he has talked about fly fishing.  I would like to get him a decent set up  rod, reel, line and a couple flies. This way he all set up . I do not  believe he knows much about fly fishing, he does enjoy using a spin cast on creeks and river so this will be a new adventure.  The thing is I have no clue what to get,  were to get it,  or what he needs.  Any ideas what a decent set up would be and were to get one? Anything I should look into ?. Anything I need that I am not thinking of ?  I live in Bruce county but travel  to London often, also could get something shipped   Any help would be great  Thanks"
833840,bare foot wader,2014-02-01 01:29:00,1354,"if you travel to London, I'd really recommend Steve at Lambeth Rod and Tackle,  he can get you going in the right direction  basically the sky, aka your budget, is the limit here....  what would your dad target mostly?  a 5 or 6 wt is often considered a good all purpose rod (use that term loosely with fly fishing, kind of like golf clubs lol) and will handle most fish in your area  I always recommend a medium action for beginners, it will help you feel the road load and is much more forgiving...stay away from the fast action stuff  unless he plans to target steelhead and salmon, the reel doesn't need to be fancy, a click pawl drag reel would be fine, and cheaper....spend more of your budget on the rod and fly lines or extra spool, a good rod and line are more important than the reel, which is essentially just to hold line unless your targeting strong running fish  a weight forward line or double taper for the lines...if he's new to fly fishing I wouldn't bother with a sinking or sink tip, can add that later if needed and nothing a few bb sized split shot can't fix on the creeks  the st Croix triumph and premier are both affordable rods with good warranties  a couple of flies won't last long with fly fishing, they get chewed up quick...and you usually save a few bucks if you buy by the dozen...again, talk to your local shop about matching the hatch if he's into trout fishing...most shops tend to carry some sort of trout collection, with a little sample of everything, nymphs, dries and streamers"
833852,Christopheraaron,2014-02-01 02:26:00,3525,"What does he fish? How big are the rivers? Are just a couple questions that need to be answered here. BFW made some good points, and I'd second the recommendation of a fiberglass or other deep bending rod. If you need flies shoot me a pm, I can make you whatever you need, even make a box of all the basic flies he'll most likely need"
833856,strik,2014-02-01 02:49:00,175,Thanks for getting back guys  he fishes now for  trout on the Saugeen  and many local creeks. Saugeen would be the biggest river he will fish. Have not set a limit  really have no clue about this stuff.  Thanks Christopher I had a idea I would be chatting to you on this topic I have a idea I will pm  you about  when I get some stuff figured out
833857,BillM,2014-02-01 02:54:00,17367,"I would also get him a day on the water with a good guide, Graham Bristow comes to mind.  He'll learn more in one day with a pro then anyone else..   Great way to start off his fly fishing adventures."
833869,Christopheraaron,2014-02-01 04:43:00,3525,"  Thanks Christopher I had a idea I would be chatting to you on this topic I have a idea I will pm  you about  when I get some stuff figured out Sounds good! Also, if you can get out with Graham I'd do it, he's a great guy and very knowledgable."
834064,FloatnFly,2014-02-02 13:01:00,1640,"if hes fishing the geen for steelhead, maybe go with a 7wt rod, TFO, Echo and Ross make really nice rods that won't break the bank.  To go along with Graham, i'd also add in Rick Whorwoods name, very good guy as well  heres the links to both pages  Rick Whorwood http://www.flycastingschool.com/index.html  Graham Bristow http://aperfectdrift.com/index.html"
834220,mosquito,2014-02-03 07:43:00,111,"Well the price range can be insane, but I agree with what I have seen here.   Graham would be a good one to go out with, he knows his stuff, a bit of a fly fishing snob but a nice guy and with his enthusiasm should make a good instructor. There is also the Orvis website that has videos on http://howtoflyfish.orvis.com/  If you are near Fletchers north of Owen Sound he often has used rods and reels or will make a custom one up and he has quite a few flies, but his prices are a bit high sometimes and Wilsons has a Fly Fishing shop in Fergus. http://www.canadasflyfishingoutfitter.com/  There is the boat and fishing show coming up Feb 14 -16th and they will have alot of flies for sale for cheap and some rods and reels (cheap sometimes (quality and price) and on up the price range until your credit card screams uncle, there but if you go you should have an idea what he wants to fish for.  Bass = streamers, poppers, leaches and wolly buggers  5 to 7wt Pike = streamer, poppers and you will need a short wire leader   6 to 9 wt Trout = alot of options depending on location, season...    3wt wet spaghetti noodle to 9 or 10 wt etc.  You can go cheap like a Crystal River Spinning/fly setup (prob. $40 at the Fishing show, easy to cart around but lacking in quality) and ok for light fishing,  March Brown makes some travel rods that fit in a suit case for going south but START at $150 a rod and you will need a large arbor reel and warm water fly line.... and the list goes on.   But if you want something just to give it a try then look for a used on Kijiji or the local shop (like Fletchers) where you can buy a package and with the Fishing (starts F. 14) and Sportsman show(starts this week I think) Bass Pro and Le Baron will have some sales on too.  There is a cheap setup on Kijiji near Owen Sound, not pretty and you might need a new line and you will need leaders but it LOOKS like it is usable. http://owensound.kijiji.ca/c-buy-and-sell-sporting-goods-exercise-fishing-camping-outdoors-Old-Shakespeare-FLY-REEL-and-8-5-ft-Mitchell-FLY-ROD-W0QQAdIdZ550255087  or a few near London http://london.kijiji.ca/f-fly-rod-Classifieds-W0QQKeywordZflyQ20rod  If you go too cheap (quality) then he might not enjoy it and get frustrated, some backyard practice time will help in the casting timing, you both can watch the Orivs basic casting video and then you can stand back and offer criticism but there is no substitution for a day with a person that knows AND can teach.  IF you are going to try the Fishing show I might go on the 14th or 15th, send me a message and I might have some advise on setups there or if it is worth the run if you are there at a different time.   P.S. there is also some material on Sport Fishing on the Fly http://www.sfotf.ca/ and http://www.thenewflyfisher.com/  That both specialize in Canadian Fly fishing"
