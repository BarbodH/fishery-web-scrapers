833501,Freshtrax,2014-01-30 06:43:00,2215,"I'm looking for a hardtop aluminum in the 22ft + range. It's going to get rigged out for  the Great Lakes.  So far my choice seem pretty obvious .  I'm thinking starcraft Islander.   Hoping to find a 26 ft hardtop,   If someone knows of another  boat that I might not have considered that meets these criteria please let me know . It needs to be able to sleep 2  ,trailerable , and  big enough for 4 out on the Great Lakes.   I got the spoon puller bug. What can I say.  I'm also hoping to stay under 15 k  Pros  Easy to repair Light Fuel efficient Cheap Takes to banging of rocks better than glass   Cons  Rougher ride than fibreglass"
833503,fishindevil,2014-01-30 08:15:00,6254,My buddy had a 19ft islander with a V4 in it and had a little sleeper berth and a small portable potty in it was a very great salmon boat and was pretty good on fuel and was awesome in fairly rough water good choice is you can find one in decent shape but there are many options out there !!!! I hope you have a truck to pull it  they are not feather weight that's for sure

833527,dave524,2014-01-30 14:32:00,4508,"15 should get you a good Islander, but move quickly they are at a premium now that Starcraft has stopped making them."
833535,BillM,2014-01-30 15:21:00,17367,"I love those Islanders, if I was going to rig a boat specifically for the Great Lakes, that would be the boat."
833558,Freshtrax,2014-01-30 18:25:00,2215,"I think it will be pretty good on simcoe greasers too.  Me and the wife need a few years to save for a cottage, and with this we can do weekend trips , and weeklong trips up the noth end of georgian bay.   And enter a few tounaments down on lake o."
833614,esoxansteel,2014-01-30 23:59:00,1307,"There was one on here in the classifieds last year or so, i believe Sebastian had it listed if memory serves me correct, not sure if he sold it though"
833615,Pikeslayer,2014-01-31 00:00:00,1443,You may also want to look @ Sylvan Offshore 2300. Nice setup including forward berth. I run a 1991 Sylvan 2150 open bow and it is a solid boat for LO & light enough to trailer anywhere.
833766,doubleheader,2014-01-31 19:07:00,497,Thre is a 22 ft islander advertised here with supposedly low hours. http://community.walleye.com/showthread.php?t=7245
833883,Sebastian,2014-02-01 13:44:00,208,I had the 22' Islander but sold it. It was not a hardtop though. It was a nice boat for big water.
833920,mcdougy,2014-02-01 19:10:00,274,"I'm sure you saw the soft top on kijji in sault ste.Marie. within your budget, add looks a little weird though."
833921,Steve,2014-02-01 19:17:00,2075,"i know your looking at aluminum, but don't discount the 'sportcraft' line of boats.  yes, fiberglass, but smaller, lighter, and awesome boats!  the 24' version is my dreamboat!"
834134,JoshS,2014-02-02 19:42:00,729,"They are sweet boats. I'd love to own one for a few seasons and just concentrate on rigging lake O, then move it to quinte in the fall... that would be the life!  I saw one on kijiji a few weeks ago out of st catherines, but think it was smaller then you're looking for...  Anyone know if the islander and sylvan offshore are the same hulls?"
