834317,Garnet,2014-02-03 22:20:00,2056,Use to be some old timers used dipping sticks like that for walleye on Rice.
834322,bare foot wader,2014-02-03 22:29:00,1354,"definitely not a spey stick..agreed on the dipping stick idea?  or perhaps a pin rod for coarse fish from England?  whatever it is, it is worth more with the patina, don't clean it...there's a few vintage forums, I've always had an answer fairly quickly after posting a pic"
834324,bare foot wader,2014-02-03 22:30:00,1354,no maker marks? anything scripted?
834326,Fisherpete,2014-02-03 22:31:00,1814,"Yeah I was going to say it looks like a rod for fishing pockets in the weeds, or for panfish like crappie? Either way, very neat!"
834331,davey buoy,2014-02-03 22:41:00,5505,"Nice rod!!!  ,my grandfather left me a 5 piece rod over 30 years ago.Figured not knowing what I know now,I left it and took all the tackle and flies,as well as a couple rods.  .Wish I was smarter than,but had no clue what it was.He did two fly in trips a year for years from what I remember.Sorta looked a bit rough like yours(compliment)but what would a 20 year old want with that.I would be a  ."

834394,fishing n autograph,2014-02-04 02:55:00,2540,A spear? Lol
834395,dave524,2014-02-04 03:04:00,4508,"Could possibly be an old greenheart flyrod, doesn't appear that different from some of the ones I see on google.  https://www.google.ca/search?q=greenheart+wood+fly+rod&rlz=1T4GZGN_enCA451CA451&tbm=isch&tbo=u&source=univ&sa=X&ei=r1fwUrD0EunYyQHv0YHYDg&ved=0CF0QsAQ&biw=1920&bih=901#imgdii=_"
834483,John,2014-02-04 18:45:00,2956,Probably Greenheart but don't think it was a fly rod. What part of the UK did he originate from?
