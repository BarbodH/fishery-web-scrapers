834161,lew,2014-02-02 22:55:00,12766,With all the deep snow this year it must be tough for alot of the animals to get around. This guy was walking across my yard an hour ago and the snow is up to his knees and we've still got a couple months of winter to go.  
834162,Terry,2014-02-02 23:07:00,14456,well get out there and shovel them a nice path  lol   poor thing
834163,Bernie,2014-02-02 23:09:00,3190,Coming home from the cottage today there were two deer on the road. They ran down the road a long way before they found a place to get off. The banks are certainly getting higher and we don't have anywhere near as much as others.I was wondering about the wild turkeys too. This kind of winter could be hard on them.
834167,NAW,2014-02-02 23:25:00,4022,My snowshoe trails cross some game trails..  And the deer bellies are dragging in a few spots.  It's not going to be great for the population..
834168,kickingfrog,2014-02-02 23:31:00,8333,"Deep snow with no crust is better for the deer then it is for the their predators. In the end, those who survive are better off. Predator or/and prey."
834171,lew,2014-02-02 23:41:00,12766,"Deep snow with no crust is better for the deer then it is for the their predators.  Yeah Rob, I spose the wolves & yotes have a tough time too with their shorter legs."
834180,irishfield,2014-02-03 00:17:00,26272,"The turkeys just fly and roost Bernie and eat what ever frozen berries and such they can find. And as Rob points out this snow is doing the deer a service as the 'yotes are having a tough time of it. I've watched a few trying to move through the yard and they could never run down a deer unless they caught them on a laneway, road or lake. Great shot Lew!"
834183,Bernie,2014-02-03 00:25:00,3190,Thanks for the info Wayne. Still a rare sight to see a turkey around here so I don't know what they do.
834186,esoxansteel,2014-02-03 00:53:00,1307,"Healthy looking deer by the way, no shortage finding food, i was worried about wolves and yotes too, but will sleep much better knowing that they will be having a harder time then the deer"
834190,lew,2014-02-03 01:11:00,12766,The turkeys just fly and roost Bernie and eat what ever frozen berries and such they can find.  And bird seed too Wayne  
834191,Joeytier,2014-02-03 01:26:00,3990,These cold winters keep the population healthy!
834192,irishfield,2014-02-03 01:32:00,26272,LOL Lew.. mine wait for the area in front of the Avgas tank to thaw out in the sun and the grass to come back up. That and the front circular laneway to do same.. they'll be waiting a LONG time for the later.. it's under 7 feet of plowed snow.
834201,Sinker,2014-02-03 02:48:00,8692,"Ive been keeping an eye on a nice flocl of turkeys since the fall, but havent seen them the last couple weeks. This deep snow will be hard on them for sure.  Its a tought winter. Survival of the fittest will certainly become a reality for some critters. It will only strengthen the one that make it.  S."
834204,mike rousseau,2014-02-03 03:29:00,4661,Just nature taking its course...  My brother shot a deer close to Christmas this year... Due to the deep snow with an ice crust on top the front of the deers legs were raw and wounded....  Survival of the fittest....  Lots of snow is bad for some... But think about this spring.... Should be great for fish spawning in creeks and rivers... And maybe bring up water levels...?    Nice pic Lew..... Must be nice to sip your coffee and watch that scene....
834211,BillM,2014-02-03 04:01:00,17367,"Lew, my dad snowblows a path for the turkeys to and from the feeder!  LOL!!!"
834222,fishindevil,2014-02-03 08:52:00,6254,"Our snowmobile club in bobcaygeon has had to post about ""be careful of the deer and even moose"" as the snow is so deep they really prefer to walk on the hard packed snowmobile trails instead of the deep snow in the bush !!!!! We have had a few close calls already this winter !!!!!! Even the turkeys as well seen a few of them on the trail yesterday just east of fenelon falls !!!!!!"
834246,Entropy,2014-02-03 15:22:00,747,There were a lot of animals on the roads and sholders right after the ice storm.  I think some of the trees falling in the forest scared them out.
834303,misfish,2014-02-03 21:53:00,29133,"There were a lot of animals on the roads and sholders right after the ice storm.  I think some of the trees falling in the forest scared them out.  This time of year,it,s not hard to find moose and deer at the side of the road. It,s do to the salt thats being spread. They will come out and lick the road/snow due to the salt."
834309,lew,2014-02-03 22:05:00,12766,"I was talking to a neighbor the other day and he said 4 deer have been hit around here in the last couple days and yesterday I had one run across right in front of me.  I'm on on a dirt road a mile & a half  in off the hiway and pretty well every time I drive in or out lately we see deer on the road. I guess their just trying to get on a decent smooth place away from the deep snow for a change. Pretty tough for them too with snow piled 4 & 5 feet deep everywhere.  Your thoughts about the salt seem good too Brian, I know deer like it."
