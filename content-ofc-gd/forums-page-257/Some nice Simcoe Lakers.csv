The biggest fish was big and almost took 10 mins to get in.  Very strong and very fat.  It was a new PB lake trout for me. My fishing rod is 28"" long Here they are from smallest to largest.  Caught all fish fro 10:30 am to 1 pm.  All fish were released.  fish 2  fish 3  Biggest fish   sometimes Simcoe can be very rewarding but other days so frustrating"
