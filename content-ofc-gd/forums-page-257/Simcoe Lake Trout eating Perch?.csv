833943,richyb,2014-02-01 21:51:00,774,mine have all had herring and smelts. I have caught them in the past with perch in them.
833945,MJL,2014-02-01 22:17:00,2427,"3yrs ago while fishing out of Lefroy, I was reeling up a perch and a laker took a swipe at it 10ft below the hole. I saw a line on the sonar rocketing up off bottom, I looked down the hole and saw an 8lb laker miss my perch by inches.LOL"

834058,flippin,2014-02-02 10:37:00,34,I remember cleaning 1 a couple yrs ago it had a smallmouth bass in it.. Bass was about 1/2lb. Caught em with perch in em too.

I have caught them with perch , sunfish , rock bass and even smaller lake trout in there gullets . I read an article in a fishing mag. a little while ago and they wrote about a laker that was caught and it was full of rubber worms and senkos and they even had a picture of it"
834457,OhioFisherman,2014-02-04 16:26:00,6623,"Most fish eat other fish, or what ever else is easily available. I cleaned a late fall Steelhead from Lake Erie one time and it had like 24 smaller fish in it's gut, emerald shiners, shad, perch, so I assume what ever was easily caught by it."
834459,BillM,2014-02-04 16:28:00,17367,"Lake trout will eat anything like Dave mentioned above.  Whitefish, perch, gobies, smelt, whatever."
834464,Christopheraaron,2014-02-04 16:38:00,3525,I'd think that it mostly depends on which part of the lake you fish.
