833205,davey buoy,2014-01-28 19:59:00,5505,"You can shim those all you want, they're not gonna cut ice. But if it stays centered,he will know that the mounting part of the auger may be alright?"
833206,Fish Farmer,2014-01-28 20:05:00,2234,"You can shim those all you want, they're not gonna cut ice. My manual auger blades look like his and cuts no problem. Shims are a cheap fix, nothing to lose. Worth a try. Just saying"
833212,DOS,2014-01-28 20:55:00,119,"Will try and keep better care of the blades from now on, self teaching ice fishing, theres a lot to remember and you learn a lot of new things through trial and error Its all good, I change many blades for customers for this exact reason.  Consider it a cheap lesson.  I try to tell people, place your auger down as slow as possible, if it makes any noise when it contacts the ice you were too fast, LOL.  also never redrill old holes.  When done drilling, it is tempting to 1/2 drill way into the ice and stand the auger up.  DON'T...  ice will form on the blades and you are back in the same boat. Hope this was helpfull  RED"
833462,pics,2014-01-30 00:37:00,1268,I had my blades sharpened by clints in Binbrook but I haven't tried them yet. If you have been out to Jordan harbour fishing your blades can look like that due to the dirt and grit blowing off the highway ...
833467,Broker,2014-01-30 00:57:00,482,Thanks! This worked very good and the blades are cutting again getting through ice in about 20 seconds. Thank you again
833468,irishfield,2014-01-30 00:59:00,26272,What worked? Shimming.. replacing...?
833469,Broker,2014-01-30 01:01:00,482,"Sorry, thought I quoted fish farmer, the shimming worked surprisingly."
833470,Fish Farmer,2014-01-30 01:03:00,2234,"That's great, glad it worked  It's a good possibility that your augers pitch could have been bent a bit, it doesn't take much, you won't see it with the eye. I have a few augers hanging in may garge that are toast. I've shimed them till I can't shim any more. One day I'm going to try bending them in the vise to try and re pitch them. Nothing to lose."
833471,irishfield,2014-01-30 01:04:00,26272,Good to hear.. means you banging it flattened out the cutting angle.
833593,pics,2014-01-30 21:39:00,1268,I just want to know how they got chewed up...lol
833657,Fish Farmer,2014-01-31 03:00:00,2234,"I just want to know how they got chewed up...lol The steel is so hard & brittle Phill, after a couple hundred holes drilling ice they do chip. Could be dirt in the ice or what ever. Cheap steel, not like the good steel you and Glenn made. Probably Arcelor or US crap"

833032,Broker,2014-01-27 23:29:00,482,"Hey guys,  Fairly new to ice fishing, started last year and my auger worked fine all year and worked fine for my first outing this year. Its a low end Rapala Nordic (probably my first problem) However today it just wasn't grabbing on my local creek for sunfish, when trying To start a new hole it would just spin all over the ice and make a very wide awkward hole and what normally takes me 30 seconds was taking me 10-20 minutes. Somethings not right just not sure what exactly it is haha. New blades, sharpen blades, new auger I have no clue. Just wanted some experienced input before I made an unnecessary investment. (Ive Maybe drilled 20-30 holes with this auger) Thanks guys!"
833033,irishfield,2014-01-27 23:37:00,26272,Did you lose the centering bit / spade off of it?
833034,Broker,2014-01-27 23:39:00,482,"Didn't notice anything out of the usual, maybe it will help if I post a picture, will do that after dinner, thanks."
833045,mukluk,2014-01-27 23:58:00,196,Did you?  Cut the hole first time out and bang the blades on the ice to clear chips etc.  Let the blades come into contact with metal objects with the blade cover not in place.  I did all the above at one time or other over the years and solution was  to replace the blades.
833049,Sinker,2014-01-28 00:02:00,8692,"Yep, your blades have been damaged. Replace them and it will work again.  Doont bang the blades, dont cut old holes, dont cut thru junk in the ice, dont push down on auger, and never touch the blades with anything but clean ice. They need to be razor sharp, no nicks or dings, or they wont cut ice.  S."
833062,Broker,2014-01-28 00:44:00,482,"Excuse the last post, didn't go through as I wanted. Anywho yes I have admittedly bashed the blades of the ice in order to get chips off of it, my bad! haha so I guess I need these replaced. Can I possibly sharpen them on my own by chance?  Heres the picture, most likely backing you guys up on the bashed up blades idea... sorry for my stupidity "

833066,misfish,2014-01-28 00:48:00,29133,have you been told   Not today.First time in a long time.
833080,Fisherman,2014-01-28 01:27:00,7201,"My freakin plastic butter knife is sharper than that rusted piece of foreign slag iron.  Pay attention, get the Made in Sweden blades, keep the cover on when not drilling, just like when you keep russell the muscle in your pants during idle times.  Protect with oil/grease during off season and never bang it on the ice to get stuff off.  Do you do that to russell?"
833081,irishfield,2014-01-28 01:29:00,26272,No he bangs that to get the ice off the hole fm !  Those blades look like you let your neighbour drill post holes with it!  Guess that model doesn't have a centering pin.. looks similar to the Strikemaster
833089,Broker,2014-01-28 02:06:00,482,"Will try and keep better care of the blades from now on, self teaching ice fishing, theres a lot to remember and you learn a lot of new things through trial and error"
833093,irishfield,2014-01-28 02:17:00,26272,Get it warmed up and running good... remove cover...drill hole... flush hole if you like.. pull auger out and blip the throttle to throw the water off. Shut off and then set it carefully on one handle (with fuel filler up) and cutting blades resting on cover cap until it dries/water freezes. Put cover on... Repeat.. (and NEVER put your hand on the auger shaft if the engine is still running!)
833115,porkpie,2014-01-28 04:14:00,2521,"Ya man your blades are badly pooched!!! Buy new, keep em in good shape!!"
833118,Sinker,2014-01-28 04:46:00,8692,Its a manual auger Wayne LOL  S.
833121,irishfield,2014-01-28 04:55:00,26272,"LOL Shayne... I guess when I saw ""it spins all over the ice"" and viewed Thorpe's Rapala powered auger this morning I threw two and two together and got Zero! ......  Now I'm REALLY wondering how you do that to the blades on a manual..."
833137,Fisherman,2014-01-28 12:50:00,7201,Postholes..
833139,Broker,2014-01-28 13:21:00,482,"Ok I get it, no more banging it off the ice to get ice shavings off of it, can't think of anything else I've done wrong but I'll take more precaution from now on. Thank you guys."
833144,Rod Caster,2014-01-28 13:40:00,5784,"New blades will make a world of difference. Don't bother sharpening them either, it never works the same."
833151,Joeytier,2014-01-28 14:36:00,3990,"Oh boy, those blades are mangled!  Kudos to you if you even managed a single hole!"
833152,BillM,2014-01-28 14:48:00,17367,"Those things are far beyond sharpening, lol.  Once you cut a hole, put the cover back on and leave it be."
833159,Cosmos,2014-01-28 15:50:00,588,There is a place in Orillia called Rockey's. They do sharpening of those blades. They have a special machine from Sweden. It's $4 per blade. Cut like new after that. Only one problem he is closed on weekends.
833170,Broker,2014-01-28 16:33:00,482,"Thanks Costa, but that's too far for me to drive just to get it sharpened, I think ill just buy new ones from around here. Thanks again."
833176,fishnsled,2014-01-28 17:20:00,3520,"Thanks Costa, but that's too far for me to drive just to get it sharpened, I think ill just buy new ones from around here. Thanks again.  I'd get a new set and ship the old ones to Rocky's for sharpening and have a spare set on hand.  I would imagine the turn around would be pretty quick on these.  Might be worth a phone call and or email with the pic to get his opinion."
833186,Fish Farmer,2014-01-28 18:25:00,2234,"Before you throw the blades away try shimming the blades. Take a soup can or a piece of thin tin and cut 2 pieces 3/16 X 2"", loosen the screws a little and shove the pieces under the cutting side of the blade then tighten. Try that. It will tilt your blades a bit and dig-in. Sometimes it doesn't matter if you buy new blades, if you have banged it, it can throw the pitch off the auger and you're augers toast. Hint: when you drill through the ice and clean the hole, reme with the upper screw part not the cutting end.  Lots of used augers in garage sales that are toast because they have been banged and the pitch is gone."
