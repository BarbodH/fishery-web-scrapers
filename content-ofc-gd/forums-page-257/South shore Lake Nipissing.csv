If anything is working better than others? Would love a bit of input, this will be my first time fishing hard water there. Thanks!"
833329,jbailey,2014-01-29 07:07:00,866,the last few days have been tough.. and cold haha. Wish i had better info for you!
833330,b_cdot,2014-01-29 07:15:00,270,looks like the weather will be a bit more tolerable next week
833344,Jay T,2014-01-29 12:18:00,282,"I was just up in Callander Bay last weekend, fishing was great! Between 5 of us we caught 75 picks, 6 pike, 16 perch and 2 whiteys."
833363,Rod Caster,2014-01-29 13:45:00,5784,"I just started fishing south shore again (ice conditions finally good for driving). We did ok, but have to move a bit to find 'the spot'.  Generally, everyone is reporting a good season."
833482,b_cdot,2014-01-30 02:59:00,270,Anything working better than others? Is the live bait bite the go to or have artificials been producing just as well. Have some small clackin raps and rattle traps that I have been willing to try with the eyes. Has this been working for some anglers? I am new to vertical jigging with the lipless cranks but it seems more exciting than deadsticking minnows. Thanks
833485,steelhunter,2014-01-30 03:37:00,81,Spoons Williams work well as well as chubby darters Live bait is always good
833515,Rod Caster,2014-01-30 13:12:00,5784,"If the bite is on, live bait is a pain in the butt. Any flashy spoon or lure you mentioned above will get you into some fish."
833523,Joeytier,2014-01-30 14:17:00,3990,Williams Nipigon is usually a deadly spoon
833555,b_cdot,2014-01-30 17:52:00,270,"thanks fellas, getting the itch, hope we get into em. 2 more days of work then were off! South shore condos is our guide."
