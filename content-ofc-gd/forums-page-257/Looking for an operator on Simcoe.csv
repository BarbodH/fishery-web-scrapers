Don and his dad went way beyond the norm to make sure everyone was comfortable,  and I've been out a couple other times with him on my own.  I have my own hut in a different part of the lake, but its nice to fish different water from time to time.  Best part is he's on fish..."

Back in the day,we fished out of Chubbs. Not sure they are around any more. East side of the lake. Fished out of Hanks after that.  Since then,I have done the wild open.  MOVE MOVE MOVE."
