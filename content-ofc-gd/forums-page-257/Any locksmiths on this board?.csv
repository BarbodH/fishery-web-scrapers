834382,tb4me,2014-02-04 01:41:00,3295,Last year I bought a new Garrison Key-less entry deadbolt with the remote controlsWell I went to install it tonight and I cant program it without a code? The code is supposedly in the manual that either it never came with or it got lost over the last year. I wouldn't think they would just hand out the codes over the phone to anyone..So can anyone here help me out at all?

834439,HTHM,2014-02-04 14:24:00,4082,"Check on the inside of the unit for a sticker with the code on it. Failing that, call with serial number and they should be able to help you.  Here is another resource: http://www.ehow.com/how_6038755_program-keyless-lock.html"
