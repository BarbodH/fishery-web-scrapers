833505,fishindevil,2014-01-30 08:20:00,6254,My friends have been fishing the north east section up by view lake and that's where there huts are and it's good acesss if the snowbanks are not too high and they have been doing well he says a few days of tough fishing then a few days of great fishing but overall he says well worth it !!! They usually move around but this year says the fishing is good enough to stay put !!! They have got into a few big slabs of crappies and some nice perch too !!!! Hope this helps      Tight-lines

833694,fishindevil,2014-01-31 08:21:00,6254,When you head from view lake head on a slight angle towards where the river mouth is there's a nice hole there !!! You will see the huts pretty much across from oakdene point but I don't think you can get on ice from that side ?? Or you can set up just off the small island there's a few rock piles there and lots of scattered weeds in the 5-7 foot range !!!! If you have a map it's easy to locate if you are walking with a portable hut it's about a 10-15 min walk or head for the bouys toward the river mouth !!! Always did well there 5-9 feet
833845,skdds,2014-02-01 02:07:00,195,Thanks for the suggestions. I was thinking about starting out from Caesarea-maps shows some deeper water there..looks like a bit of a walk to the island..!
