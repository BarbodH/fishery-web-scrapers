833611,DRIFTER_016,2014-01-30 23:33:00,10439,Looks like they're changing up the chase this year. Don't know how I feel about the new format yet. We'll have to see how it goes this season.  http://www.nascar.com/en_us/news-media/articles/2014/1/30/chase-for-the-nascar-sprint-cup-championship-format-changes.html
833616,Bernie,2014-01-31 00:00:00,3190,From what I understand at this point it may be OK.It could make an exciting final race.I'd have to say it will be better than it was.
833628,lookinforwalleye,2014-01-31 00:54:00,4399,Nascar has been a big bore since  Winston left...imho.
833634,Handlebarz,2014-01-31 01:36:00,3790,"Run what ya brung let's see them puppies fly who has the biggest set to keep the foot to the floor 4 wide into turn 3, 16 tires are better the 4 as DW would say."
833645,Joey,2014-01-31 02:25:00,9122,Well it will be interesting by the sounds of it.  Anything is better than what has been the last few years.
833756,mcdougy,2014-01-31 18:12:00,274,"I will go out on a limb and guess.... with this new format and attempt to spark interest and to start filling their half empty stands. That D.E. II will have a little something extra under the hood by race end, and win the Daytona 500.  It will be like poetry written by the Franze family.  I do believe there is some advantages awarded once in a while. MM"
833761,Garnet,2014-01-31 18:45:00,2056,Last years 500 was the worst race I've seen.  They just lined up and everybody was afraid to make a move. Had to be the worst last 10 laps in Daytona history.
833768,wallyboss,2014-01-31 19:11:00,1095,"This might just get me back into being a fan.  Ever since they've started the CHASE I've lost all interest.  And only watched a few races a year, Daytona and Talladega.   I agree last years Daytona 500 was one of the worst races of the year."

I do believe there is some advantages awarded once in a while. MM Back in the day when I was a big fan I would go to 2-3 races a year and you always had to order your tickets months in advance or you would be SOL, I was shocked two years ago when I was in Daytona with a buddy and a couple of weeks before the race he walked up to the box office and basically could get any seat he wanted. The new good ole boys just don`t have it in my opinion....miss... DW,Rusty,Dale, the Allisons etc. these guys came to race...today`s drivers seem to be more worried about their hair style!!!! IMHO"
833798,lookinforwalleye,2014-01-31 21:49:00,4399,Last years 500 was the worst race I've seen.  They just lined up and everybody was afraid to make a move. Had to be the worst last 10 laps in Daytona history. I don`t think they wanted to scare Dannicka!!!
833806,misfish,2014-01-31 22:30:00,29133," Don't forget the best little track on the circuit, Bristol!!!  Use to be the best ticket to get.3-4 year waiting list. Now you can buy a ticket like said,at the gate.  I cant remember seeing seats empty as they were last year. ALL RACES.  Bring a super track to Canada. SOLD OUT everytime I,ll bet."
833814,Tayzak15,2014-01-31 23:48:00,318,I love the new format however if the final race is for all the marbles wouldn't it be cool if they moved the Daytona 500 to the end of the season to be the championship deciding race rather than Homestead Miami?
833868,tb4me,2014-02-01 04:39:00,3295,Looks like they have changes qualifying too. They switched to the Indy and F1 style..From what I understand the best cars will race.Sadly I quit watching most races after the may long weekend as its river fishing time..Walleye n pike are way more fun to watch...
833875,danc,2014-02-01 05:37:00,4677,"Problem with the new format is that Jimmie (or insert any name here) can win the first 35 races, and finish second in the 36th race, and not win the championship. I know that its not gonna happen but I dont like the idea of racing well all year long and losing the championship on a loose lugnut."
833927,misfish,2014-02-01 20:08:00,29133,"God forbid,JJ didnt win again.LOL  I like the new set up. I want to see restricter plates GONE.  Fast as fast can be,you cant catch me. LMAO"
833928,Steve,2014-02-01 20:09:00,2075,"anything will help.  nascar is just a shadow of what it once was.  my uncle used to be the biggest nascar fan....went to about five races a year....  at christmas I asked him what was up....he said he's lost interest....  if uncle jimmy lost interest, then something definitely is up.....cause he was a nascar nut."
