834289,Fisherpete,2014-02-03 21:16:00,1814,"I have had my Fuji XP10 camera now for a few years, and the battery would no longer hold a charge. I looked around, and to get the same replacement Fuji battery would be between $40 and $60... yikes! Found a dealer on Ebay that carries aftermarket ones... with higher capacity (1200 mAh vs the stock 700)... the price - $3.69 each! Two of them to my door, including the shipping, for $10.60. Tested one out yesterday - took over 100 shots and the battery still read full!  Happy camper!"
834292,mike rousseau,2014-02-03 21:20:00,4661,That's great...  Amazing what you can get aftermarket
834294,Fisherpete,2014-02-03 21:23:00,1814,"I was a sucker on a previous camera... which was high end at the time in 2003 (Canon G3), and paid $110 for a second battery from Future Shop when I bought it... never again!"
834296,lookinforwalleye,2014-02-03 21:27:00,4399,I hope it works for you...personally I like my camera too much to trust it to a 3 dollar battery.
834297,Steve,2014-02-03 21:27:00,2075,laptop batteries the same way.  Future Shop etc will charge $100+  ebay - $12
834299,misfish,2014-02-03 21:41:00,29133,Ya I have had my XP for 2 years now. The battery will not hold a charge well now. I have used it alot though..
834300,davey buoy,2014-02-03 21:47:00,5505,"Can it really hurt your camera?after market or not?When is dead is dead,maybe spikes in voltage?,not sure that would hurt it on a battery.Anyone know for sure?."
834315,lookinforwalleye,2014-02-03 22:17:00,4399,Not sure I was thinking leakage...I wouldn`t trust a camera worth several hundred dollars to 3 dollar battery but that is just me!
834320,Fisherpete,2014-02-03 22:27:00,1814,"I doubt it would leak, it is similar to a cell phone battery... Li-Ion... but I guess only time will tell. The camera owes me nothing, it has taken thousands of pictures and quite a few underwater videos... and it was only $150 to start with!  Like Ivan Drago said in Rocky IV... ""If he dies... he dies...""  LOL"
834327,misfish,2014-02-03 22:33:00,29133,Another Rocky fan.
834370,woodenboater,2014-02-04 00:52:00,2277,"I'd be worried about poor build leading to circuit fry age or worse. As lookingforwalleye says, why spend a good amount of hard earned money on a camera to cheap out on batteries ? Same with memory cards  ymmv"
834392,BillM,2014-02-04 02:53:00,17367,"If you guys want a good set of batteries, buy a set of Eneloops and a decent charger (i just picked up a La Crosse BC700)..  It will charge any AAA or AA NiCad/NiMH and will restore/refresh any of your old rechargeables as well.   I've had too many packs of 'brand new' Duracells be completely dead out of the box to waste anymore $$$ on store bought batteries."
834399,John Bacon,2014-02-04 03:14:00,3277,Not sure I was thinking leakage...I wouldn`t trust a camera worth several hundred dollars to 3 dollar battery but that is just me!  I can understand your logic if it is still a new camera.  But if the battery is dead the camera is probably several years old and not worth much.  My first digital camera cost me about $800; but I probably couldn't get much more than $20 for it now.  Technology changes fast.
834417,solopaddler,2014-02-04 10:46:00,8605,"I bought half a dozen batteries online for my Canon camera for under 5 bucks each. Mainly so I'd never run out of juice on any of my extended trips in the bush. Was a Canadian online retailer, can't remember which.  Still going on strong well into my second year with these batteries.  Can't imagine why anyone would pay full pop but each to their own."
834453,Steve Piggott,2014-02-04 15:47:00,196,Tmart for online battery
834460,bigugli,2014-02-04 16:28:00,6138,I paid $10 for my last set of 4 rechargeables for the camera. 3 years later and still going strong.
834471,Freshtrax,2014-02-04 17:25:00,2215,Great tip thanks for the info.   I could see if it was a thousand dollar camera not cheating out but with a point and shoot who cares.     The batteries are probably made across the street from where the originals were made some place in china.
834475,BillM,2014-02-04 17:45:00,17367,"I definitely wouldn't put an off brand battery in my DSLR, but a P&S?  Absolutely."
