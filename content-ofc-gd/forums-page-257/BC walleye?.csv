833659,bare foot wader,2014-01-31 03:22:00,1354,"When most folks think about fishing in BC it tends to be mostly about the salmon and trout, but I am fortunate to live pretty close to one of the few natural walleye lakes - Charlie lake, which is located at about the 50 mile marker up the Alaska highway. Not many eyes over the 5lb mark, but is a fish factory for the 18-24 inchers. Figured I'd post a few pics, most of my buddies are surprised when I tell them I fish walleye in BC.  My ice season got off to a slow start, rats found my otter portable, which in turn collected rain water all summer (why don't I check up on things! damnit) and also about 20 lbs of rat turds and urine. Back before Christmas I was dealing with a 5' long block of frozen ice/turds/urine...perfect excuse to pick up a new pop up while I thawed and sanitized over and over and over until the stench slowly went away  I would not wish this stench on anybody, in hindsight, I should have been wearing a mask and gloves hahahah    the only positive was those plano waterproof boxes are actually waterproof and 2 of my 3 ice boxes were completely ok, without any cleaning...the other box took some CLR and about 50 bucks in new hooks  We had some very mild weather and ice got sketchy...froze up again and this past Sunday I was itching to get out. The navionics app is pretty handy, starting to use it more (this trip was essential as I forgot my GPS) and it was pretty accurate on water depth and easy to find one of my favourite hot spots.     I drilled a few shallow holes in advance of the evening bite, and then got setup out deeper, before I had even dropped my line I was already smiling, love the LX7....I knew this was hard bottom, and I knew exactly what I was looking at    I was on top of fish the whole day but it was a tough bite, I had to really downsize and they were incredibly light bites...all the walleyes were barely hooked in the tip of the nose...I kept my limit and threw back a good half dozen or so....the jig had to be perfectly horizontal, I usually tie loop knots but had to tie a clinch and set the knot so that the jig suspended nicely horizontal...once I downsized and got it dialed I was getting bit, lots of missed bites and lost fish halfway up      landed a few small pike too    and this guy was from my last visit, before the ice got really mushy    all the walleye came on a tiny lindy jig I think it was, tipped with a sliver of tail or shrimp....but the pike came on some little jigs I tie up, feels a tiny bit nicer catching a fish on something you spun up yourself      you can see how wide the pressure crack opened up a couple weeks ago      That was it for the walleye, still gotta fry them up...but I don't post reports too often, so I'll throw in a few extras....   dogs enjoying the extra room in the pop up...and me enjoying focusing solely on fishing, and not constantly scanning for wolves or them dang coyotes, it's very nice having the extra room in the pop up to keep the mutts comfortable instead of exploring the shoreline    a pennask strain stocker from a nearby lake    my last steelhead trip of 2013 resulted in zero steelies, but I did get a big resident bow....there is not a single stocked trout in BC that can compare to a wild trout, the colours, the fight, totally different ball game with the wild guys    and everybody should know who built that rod, I always get tons of compliments on it...thank you again Spiel!  these perch I caught just before last ice 2013 and are from a northern AB lake, it has some pretty tight regs but I gotta say that I think the management plan is working, these fish are honestly the average size...and that's a tall boy can to clarify LOL...that big guy is a little better than average, probably close to my PB but I have seen others catch bigger  this lake has a 5 perch limit and there are some legit 2 lbers in there    I joined up on the OFC tourney this year, I'm fairly confident I can contribute with some big springs...this was my largest from 2013, 43"" x 29...as always, I lost bigger but that only makes you fish harder      largest sturgeon this year, not much to brag about on the fraser but any sturgeon is an awesome fish really...didnt' insure my boat for tidal but hoping to this year, if stupid work doesn't get in the way lol    another small guy from the same day      and for the hunters on here, a small 4pt mulie...that I missed   spent 2 days tracking him after the shot and it is sick feeling indeed, I was very relieved and happy to see he survived the season      that's it for now, since I joined the tourney this year I better work on more fishin reports lol  cheers.

833668,BillM,2014-01-31 03:40:00,17367,How many guys does that drift boat hold?   :)   Great report man!  I have no idea BC had walleyes.
833675,Sinker,2014-01-31 04:14:00,8692,Great report! Good mixed bag of fish there!  S.
833695,fishindevil,2014-01-31 08:49:00,6254,Amazing report with lots of species !!! And nice ones at that !!!! Glad to see some walleyes in BC !! Great program they started as well as in Alberta! Thanks for sharing !!! Tight-lines

I have no idea BC had walleyes.  that thing is basically a massive bath tub, one of the better ones I've been in....it has a row of 3 seats in the front, and a seat in the rear for the guide to row  we'll drift the smaller rivers in our pontoons, but the big rivers it's hard to beat a real drift boat with an experienced guide, some real nasty sweepers and rapids    my next report will probably be Cold Lake, AB/SK for lake trout...tying up some 1oz jigs for those pigs now"

833732,fishnsled,2014-01-31 16:18:00,3520,That was a fun read.  Lots of variety and some good fish as well.  5 fish limit on the perch eh?  Well if the fish are getting to that size it's a good thing.

833832,67ZL1,2014-02-01 00:50:00,51,"Hey Bare Foot, if you want to hit Slave Lake this year just PM and maybe we can hook up. I assume you live around Fort St. John? I'm in GP. When the bite is hot in June it's nothing to catch 150-200 walleye in 6-7 hours!"

Holy cow, exactly where is it you live??? (If you're ever looking for a steelhead fishing partner I'm there!)  Just an outstanding report, very cool! I had heard rumors of walleye in BC but had no clue there were natural lakes. I'll bet no one fishes for them either.  Nice float rod too. Was yours the one with all the counterweights in the butt?"
834063,RDR,2014-02-02 12:50:00,125,Great report! Nice variety of fish from some very interesting locations. The Walleye portion really surprises me as well. They look to be a very healthy population and a nice option to have when surrounded by some of the best Salmon and Trout fishing on the planet. Just awesome! Thanks for sharing!  So you were the one who requested that build. Very nice! Chris does a fine job and it's good to see his customers enjoying the fruits of his labour
834091,bare foot wader,2014-02-02 16:30:00,1354,"Yes, I had the rod with the counterweight kit from bps, works great for me, I like the balance ...amazing work and I always get compliments....the reel is a Milner reel from cranbrook, bc...a complete Canadian combo  67ZL1 got it, I'm right near fort St. John and those perch were caught not too far from lesser slave   And I'm always willing to point guys in the right direction if they visit BC, I lived around van and whis and did a lot of river fishing...now thst I'm further north Im slowly learning the skeena and bulkley watersheds...that salmon was on the kitimat river"
