833648,Joey,2014-01-31 02:37:00,9122,Groan.  Comical but I wonder how much crap ended up in the water from all those vehicles.
833654,Steelheadphycho,2014-01-31 02:51:00,470,What a bunch of brainiacs........
833693,fishindevil,2014-01-31 08:03:00,6254,Reminds my of the 80's at the launch ramp in deseronto when it was a single ramp and a 1hr line up to get into the bay people were trying to launch anywhere they could and it was just like that !!!! I have seen fist fights and cars & trucks stuck as well !!!! Pretty crazy ..... With those waves rolling the sand around it holds onto your vehicle like glue bunch of rookies for sure !!!!!

If they had left the first truck in the water a little longer, it would have floated out to the first sand bar and they could have had a picnic! Those tractor guys are there every weekend in the summer... the smart boaters just pay the guys some $$ and are done with it. The other guys provide entertainment for the sun babies! LOL HH"
