833870,Can_38,2014-02-01 05:06:00,152,I have a Garmin dakota unit loaded with city streets map.  This map does not show the river system (Montreal River) I fish every June .  Does anyone have either of the two mentioned maps loaded on a Garmin device.
833873,chris.brock,2014-02-01 05:21:00,4053,I've got Topo on my computer I use for my Etrex
833874,Can_38,2014-02-01 05:31:00,152,Can you zoom in enough to see the Montreal river as it connects up to lady Evelyn ?
833876,chris.brock,2014-02-01 05:59:00,4053,"yeah, it zooms right in, the actual connection has no detail though, just a blue line at Mattawapika Dam  I tried to paste a picture of it, but couldn't figure out how to do it (if possible?)  are you concerned about how much detail you can see?"
833877,Can_38,2014-02-01 06:04:00,152,Would like to know where I am in relation to camp.

833882,Jon,2014-02-01 13:39:00,209,You can also try Ibycus maps (free) or Backroad Mapbooks (paid).  Here is a screenshot from Garmin Basecamp of the Ibycus mapping http://www.flickr.com/photos/91080279@N05/12250454075/  Link to Ibycus mapping web-site http://www.ibycus.com/ibycustopo/  Jon 
833890,Can_38,2014-02-01 14:36:00,152,Thanks Jon I will check it out.
833891,SirCranksalot,2014-02-01 15:07:00,3291,"I paid the Ibycus guy $20 and he sent a DVD to me with topos for all of Canada. I guess I could have done it myself if I'd spent some time figuring it all out, but it didn't seem worth the bother."
833895,Jon,2014-02-01 15:40:00,209,I got the Ibycus mapping 3 or 4 years ago when it was downloadable from the website. The install was pretty easy. I think you have to use Bit-torrent to get the free one now but I assume the install process is still pretty similar. I don't know if the guy regularly updates his mapping or not. I assume the others are more current?  Jon
833938,BillM,2014-02-01 21:15:00,17367,"Yup, Ibycus is available on a number of torrent sites.  I've also use the Garmin Ontario Topo v4 quite a bit."
