834153,Joey,2014-02-02 21:27:00,9122,What a shame.  Great actor!
834155,GbayGiant,2014-02-02 21:40:00,1780,feelings go out to the ones he left behind.
834156,Dutch,2014-02-02 21:57:00,831,Too bad for his kids. Lost a dad for being a selfish drug addict.
834206,mike rousseau,2014-02-03 03:38:00,4661,Great actor...  He had a special ability to make you believe he was the character he was playing.... I mean truly believe...
834239,mattybculp,2014-02-03 14:21:00,388,"to be honest with you, he always creeped me out ! But perhaps that's how good of an actor he was. Its too bad."
834280,moxie,2014-02-03 19:32:00,1566,"First glimpse of him for me was in Scent of a woman and again in Twister .Thought he did alright for the bit parts he was given in those but haven't seen any of his other works. A shame indeed cause by the sounds of it he really found his groove and earned his chops after that. But alas as many in the parallel world known as show biz his demons followed him and eventually led him to an early demise. Guess it might be time to see just what everyone was goin on about cause after all, the ""Show""  must go on."
834407,Stoty,2014-02-04 06:13:00,2910,Couldn't agree more Dutch. Completely selfish.
834435,Headhunter,2014-02-04 14:06:00,5703,"I know not what demons he dealt with in his life, I have to think they were pretty powerful. It's a shame that such talent is now gone and even more so, for his family. One of my favorite actors... if he was in a film, you just knew it would be a good film. He will be missed. HH"
