833958,redpearl99,2014-02-01 23:00:00,259,I've skunked the last 5 times I've gone ice fishing with my dad  at Simcoe and other kettle lakes.  Im thinking of trying Little Lake for the first time tomorrow and cant afford to get skunked again.  So has anyone been out there lately???
833962,irishfield,2014-02-01 23:07:00,26272,"You can always afford to get skunked, it just makes the days you don't that much more rewarding. Get out there and tell us how you did tomorrow night!"

834006,redpearl99,2014-02-02 01:28:00,259,"I've never fished Gilford.  Is there easy access?  If fishing little lake, should I be fishing the deepest spot since it's a bowl?"
834095,Beans,2014-02-02 17:03:00,3339,"I guess you are not referring to carp fishing in Little Lake, Peterborough..."
834103,bobowski,2014-02-02 17:25:00,360,Fish are never guaranteed. What species are you looking to catch?
834108,misfish,2014-02-02 18:23:00,29133,"I dont fish there  til after march 15th.. I would bet theres got to be 20+ inches of ice on it now.. I was on 18"" where I fished Simcoe this morning."
834149,Joeytier,2014-02-02 21:16:00,3990,"You seem to like being spoon-fed information.  Do your homework and get out there, man!"
834151,misfish,2014-02-02 21:23:00,29133,"You seem to like being spoon-fed information. Do your homework and get out there, man!   It,s a little lake.LOL"
834422,fisherman7,2014-02-04 12:41:00,325,I can't tell you how the fishing is but I drive by there every day and there's about a dozen huts close to the 400 side. Been there for a while now.
