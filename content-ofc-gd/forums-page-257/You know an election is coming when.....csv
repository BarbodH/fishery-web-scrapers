Don't forget that when harpo was elected PM he was 45 or 46 and disappeared for a few days because he was terrified and anxious. He was put on a valium type of drug and came back to the public eye. Trudeau is too young or no experience? This would have applied to harpo when he won in 2006 but hey everyone ( 32%) voted for him LOL. Harper disappeared for a few days while this kids mom was puffin and swiggin up a storm for years leading up to the 9 months till his birth.  I'll take my chances with Harper.  I hear ya though Squid. They're all the same once they take office. Seems like they forget everything they learned in the real world. Theres the other difference. This kid has never and will never live in the real world. He majors in acting at 40+!!! This boy is a hollow puppet. This guy is going to lead who, where and how???  That is a scary proposition."

Why would you focus on just 3 people?.... it's the party you vote for, not the person. There are lots of good/bad people within every party. If you don't get that, then step away from the keyboard.  Modern politics reminds me of a Sens/Habs/Leafs debate."

If you don't get that, then step away from the keyboard.  Modern politics reminds me of a Sens/Habs/Leafs debate. With all due respect I beg to differ. The argument of good vs bad strikes me as a simpletons view. The leader has everything to do with any group being led. Armies, Corporations, Families, Animals. They can and are usually a galvanizing force and can be the difference between the groups success and its ultimate failure. No?  The lieberals have been reaching for a while now and when this kid came along they saw a simple solution to a very nagging issue. How to win an election. The very fact they chose this kid for his looks rather than what he brings as a true leader is more of a reason to throw out the baby and the bath water. They are as useless to this country as he is. Since when did governance turn into pageantry? You remember the lipstick on a pig thing?"
833140,Rod Caster,2014-01-28 13:23:00,5784,"Nope, it's the entire party. Focusing on one person is simpleton and raw raw go sports team stuff. He certainly is a symbol, but an entire party he does not make. Eliminating the senators, aides, the MP's and the party's combined forces leads to misguided opinions and fanfare. For example, the loss of Hugh Segal is a bit hit to the Conservative party imo, but no one talks about that.  I still can't figure out why the Liberals didn't choose the astronaut as their leader."
833147,moxie,2014-01-28 13:44:00,1566,"Focusing on "" ONE"" person is simpleton and raw raw go sports ""TEAM ""stuff? Ok then. Glad you made that clearer for me. The kid is a dolt and was chosen by the other members of that party. Does that say nothing about them?  If I had my way every time there is a gross misstep by a politician they would be made an example of in a way to be remembered and feared to be repeated. These clowns play games with our very lives with no repercussions and knowing that a party holds our intellect in such high regard by trying to swindle an electorate with this punchable faced Rookie tells me all I need to know about what they have in store for us if they ever become the governing party. Save the lipstick. Smells like pork to me."
833148,Rod Caster,2014-01-28 13:54:00,5784,"'punchable- faced' ? hahaha.  If you had your way, we'd all be in trouble. You sound like a very angry and violent person."

Business is business and at least they're trying to get the word out regardless of the pie in the sky bull they're looking to sell. The lesser of three evils would be an option instead of sitting on my ass and refusing to vote. Those that choose not to should be ashamed as it is a freedom of choice that was bled for.  As far as this Justin kid goes he should stick to something he's good at and if someone has any idea what it is let me know what it is cause it sure isn't politics. All he shares with his late Pappy Pete is his last name and one look at the other side of the gene pool he was spawned from seals the lid on that coffin of debate for me. No nine inch nails needed unless the masses of unknowing and easily fooled, forever down looking generational unwashed vote for this boy. Votes for this political  lightweight would solidify my belief that the Zombie Apocalypse is truly upon us.  No name calling here, simply an independent observation."

He has turned many heads..I don't support him but I don't support Harper..Honestly, im lost. i don't know who to vote for..Doesn't seem to matter who we vote in they ALWAYS turn out to be thieving loser bags that should be put in prison.

I can tell a few of you support Mulcair.  You were/are probably  union ppl  looking for added security but unfortunately we cannot afford that anymore.  Why? The leaders of the worlds largest economies forced forward a global economy that is erasing the middle class.  It would of been a good decision, if we had other worlds to trade with!   Its the worst thing for the planets longterm health and for countries, like Canada, that had a strong middleclass. Trudeau only admitted to pot smoking as he knew it was recorded by someone and did so to take the shock and awe away from whomever has it.   Granted it will get him some votes from young heads, if they remember when and where to vote.  He will get a lot of new Canadian votes due to his father opening the door so wide.   It is the ONLY reason he is going to be on the ballot.   Imagine if he actually gets in! I know Washington's and Colorodo's economies are currenty very high!   hmmm. I'd rather be fishing!"
