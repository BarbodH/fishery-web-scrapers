Several emergency vehicles were lost in a fire Sunday morning when the Mount Albert, Ont., fire station went up in flames. Emergency crews from Holland Landing and Queensville fire stations were called to the blaze shortly after 8 a.m. at 22 Princess St., Mount Albert, northeast of Newmarket, Ont. Officials said no one was injured, but there was a significant loss of property and equipment. The station housed six fire and support vehicles. ""This is a significant loss to our community and to the firefighters of the Mount Albert Station,"" Mayor Virginia Hackson said in a release. East Gwillimbury Emergency Services is made up of paid on-call volunteer and full-time firefighters who work out of three stations, including Holland Landing, Queensville and Mount Albert."

834369,Fisherman,2014-02-04 00:41:00,7201,"Don't know all the requirements, but I would have thought that ""newer"" buildings would have an auto sprinkler, especially when unattended."
834379,Rich Clemens,2014-02-04 01:17:00,3131,"We had a fire company in the area who lost their building and a lot if equipment.  Everyone came together, donations of equipment from neighboring fire companies.  Didn't take them long to get going again.  Tragic as it could happen anywhere - fire companies are not immune."
