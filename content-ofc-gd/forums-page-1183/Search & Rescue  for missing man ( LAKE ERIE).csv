92778,Mike the Pike,2007-07-11 02:58:00,3421,If you can't wear your PFD all the time at least wear it when the boat is moving.I have been in others boats and lets just say your PFD is useless in the boat storage compartment.I do wear my PFD almost all the time.Did you know 85% of boaters who drown were not wearing a PFD.  My next purchase will be a self inflating PFD the automatic model.SO sad.MTP
