This is our first trip to Trout Lake and I am wondering if anyone has been on the lake and has any reports.   Naturally, any tips or advise would be appreciated.  As a side note, I have traveled into Canada well over 25 times for fishing trips and am obviously impressed with the fishing, scenery etc.  Just want to pass along what a nice bunch of people you all have been literally every time we visit.  I hope we are as friendly and helpful if any of you ever visit Texas.  Thanks,  John Steffens"
