92434,jediangler,2007-07-10 13:57:00,1923,Just a heads up for OFC'ers that the Burns memorial fishing derby at Valens is this Saturday. This is a great family event as children can enter any panfish to get great prizes. For the adults there are categories for largemouth and pike. This is a live release derby with bonus weight added if your fish swims away. They have many 12' aluminum boats for rental if you don't own one yourself. Here's a link to the events page.  http://www.conservationhamilton.ca/parks/events/default.asp  At Valens there are great campsites and a really nice beach for the kiddies. Just thought some of the fishing families would enjoy it.
