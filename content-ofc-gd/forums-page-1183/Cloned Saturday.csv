91746,keram,2007-07-08 14:34:00,585,"Went with my friend again to the same lake (like last Saturday), and almost everything has repeated itself  .  . We hooked 8-9 pikes and two LMB. Landed four pikes and both LMB ( exactly like week ago). The only difference was that we were on the water 1 hr earlier and fished different part of the lake.  Some picks   Few min after 5:00 am    No pics of bass, but both were in 2 lb range And as usually, two pikes have ""accepted""  invitation for fish fry contest         "
91753,Roy,2007-07-08 14:42:00,13728,"Jeez Keram, looks like you both had a great time. And look at the stuff in that boat! You look like Tim the toolman Taylor. (bless your little heart)"
91799,nofish4me,2007-07-08 17:52:00,404,"Well, it takes alot of gear these days, just to hide a couple of beer. Nice pictures and I bet the fish tasted great!"
91811,bbog,2007-07-08 19:02:00,665,Looks like the amount of gear I squeeze into my canoe  Great report and pictures.
91882,Joey,2007-07-09 00:41:00,9122,Great report Keram.  Any bass inches for Team 2?  Joey
92202,keram,2007-07-09 21:24:00,585,"Thanks for the blessings Roy, next time I'm on the water I will need them. . In regards to ""staff"" in my boat, this is just optical illusion. The reason is simple: I'm big and boat is small. If Iwork hard I can even find enough space to stand up ( not because I want to, but because I have to )    Sorry Joey, not yet. Untill now, all the inches were ""insignificant"", or slightly below the ""inches"" already entered. But I can assure you I'm working on it."
92253,addict,2007-07-10 00:57:00,475,i love those pike that accept the invtation to a fish fry contest lol.once u remove the y bones in my opinion i think the tastey better than pickeral.
