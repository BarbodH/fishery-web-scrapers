Heres Jaden eating some frog.... at a great Vietnamise restaurant in Chinatown...   Heres a picture we took today at the World Trade Center site...  I got all choked up just standing there... it was the most moving experience I've had in a while..... I don't want to have a political discussion here... but standing there may change a few opinions...   We went down and jumped on the Staton Island Ferry and too a ride (FREE!!) accross the bottom of Manhattan to Jersey and got to snap some pics of Lady Liberty along the way..  On the way back to the motel we walked through little italy...   Were gonna go walk around Times Square....  tommorow. hopefully its Central Park and the Museum of Natural History before catching the train back to Saratoga Springs!
92280,Jen,2007-07-10 02:02:00,833,"Looks like the trip is really adding a whole new perspective to your thoughts... Some amazing pictures but even more noticible is the amazing family time you are sharing.  Something can be said for kids who will order food when they can not really read the menu...  Thanks for the pictures... you certainly know how to share a vacation!  Cheers,  jen"
