So if you catch a big one, you can officially enter it into the derby.  You can also buy 1-day licenses aboard the boat for $10 a person if they don't have them  http://www.salmonexpress.com  Tony"
92068,FishFinder,2007-07-09 15:41:00,481,"How many people are going to be on the charter? Do you want food provided with the charter? Do you want big fish(generally later in the season), or smaller fish for a better meal? Just some questions you should consider I work on a Charter out of Port Credit so feel free to shoot me a PM if you have any specific questions."
