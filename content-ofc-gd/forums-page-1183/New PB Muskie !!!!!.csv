92479,bigbuck,2007-07-10 14:54:00,2449,"Sweet!!! Gotta love catching an incidental muskie like that. 8lb test, must have been a fairly long fight to bring in that 47 incher, she musta weighed about 20-25 lbs easy. Good work!!!"
92485,kemper,2007-07-10 15:06:00,2232,"8 pound test!  impressive, Ive hooked into a few while smallie fishin with 8 pound test and every one has taken me hook line and sinker. I happened upon a musky this weekend as well, only it wasnt quite that large...  Cool to get a surprise fish like that"
92533,cityfisher,2007-07-10 17:51:00,959,"first thing i said it ""how the fck am i gonna land this thing"" lol  after 15 mins and many runs for the bottem I got my chance at the jaw and went for it !  Luckly I got only a couple scars on my hand !  I got him on a drop shotting rig with a bell sinker and a circle hook... the Line was destroyed after i looked at it .... twists and kinks everywhere... I was lucky to say the least !"

92312,cityfisher,2007-07-10 03:35:00,959,"Hey all,  Rented a cottage up in the haliburton area for the weekend with my GF.  Planning on quadding saturday and fishing sunday.  Quadding was fun but I was itching to fish since its really been a while since I fished hard on a more remote lake ( compared to simcoe every weekend ).   Nailed 5-6 pike ( 2-5lbs ) throughout the day and my GF landed a nice 2-3 lb bass !! Shes a  Keeper !    Then while working my Yum Dinger I get a hit and BANG set it hard.... I feel dead weight but then it starts to move and all of a sudden this beast rockets to the surface and jumps a couple feet into the air right beside the boat... Gave me and my GF a Heart attack !  Now im freaking since I got 8lb test mono and a size 4 circle hook in this guys Jaws !    after what feels like forever I go for the jaws and lift the monster out ( no net of course !! )    WOW ! 47 inches !!!!    After a couple pics ... I revived the musky until she gave me a splash in the face  well worth it !     Rest of my trip was a blur  .. Now i need a 50 ++"
