92339,Roy,2007-07-10 09:34:00,13728,Does anyone know where I can get the quickest delivery on 130lb Seaguar at a reasonable price?
92342,SlowPoke,2007-07-10 09:54:00,2984,"What do you plan on towing with it?  Try Boatfix.com, they show 100lb on the site but maybe you can call. Some good prices there.  -Brian"
92348,lew,2007-07-10 10:43:00,12767,"Roy, give Brian a call at JB's......416-614-7222......I think they do a bit of mail order on smaller items.....tell him your a friend of mine.  If not, I'll pick it up & mail it to you."
92349,Roy,2007-07-10 10:49:00,13728,"Thanks Brian and Lew.....I'll get it done today.  I was visiting Rollie and Helen's earlier this morning and I saw 100lb Climax fluoro in 10 yard lengths for something like 10.99. I've never heard of anyone using the stuff though.  ps. I just happened to look at the 3 avatars on this thread and it's strange that the skies and the wind, water etc. look pretty similar."

92606,Greencoachdog,2007-07-10 20:06:00,8163,"you can get it Next Day Air from Cabelas or BPS for the price of the line + shipping + $20, if you don't need it that quickly... Cabelas is twice as fast as BPS on regular shipping."
