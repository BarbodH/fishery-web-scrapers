You have the best community of anglers I've seen to date so great job. I hope to contribute a more often as I do fish myself fishing about 120 days a year and have for about 25 years.  Weekend was great participating in Fishing Week festvities and Toronto Island. Pike and Bass fishing was PHENOMINAL all weekend.  Bass all caught on Green Senkos and Northerns on White Spinnerbaits 3/4 oz double willow.
