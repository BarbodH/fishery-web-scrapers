Always remember, when wearing sandals to put sunscreen on the tops of your feet. I forgot. I hurt   . We got lucky with the weather though. The rain just missed us, and we had overcast skies the whole day. It made for beauty fishing weather. We caught a lot of fish, but our biggest was 19"" which didn't beat the Team #4 current Largemouth. This lake has both Large and Smallmouth and both were turned on that day. We even got into some mid day topwater action thanks to the overcast skies. Here's some pics....nothing huge, and the camera flash didn't go off on the biggest fish so the picture is kinda dark. Had a blast though, and my buddy showed his rock bass prowess by catching 2 at once lol.        Hookset."

Two rock bass at the same time? now that is impressive!! LOL.  Nice pics...the topwater action must have been pretty cool.  Thanks for the report"
