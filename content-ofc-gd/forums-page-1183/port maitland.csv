92241,danbouck,2007-07-10 00:41:00,4380,There are walleye between Dunnville and Port Maitland but last I heard they were pretty deep. Check out Fishmasters board to hear the latest on catching eyes down there http://fishmaster.proboards46.com/index.cg...rd=fishhunttalk

92289,Jen,2007-07-10 02:11:00,833,Worm harnesses a 20 jet and worms that look like snakes... ( I think they get that way if you leave them in a little moister soil then they are used to.)  I am kinda new at this but am learning a little...
