Picked up worms instead but decided to head to dunnville dam. Got there and started tossing worms on a pickerel rig bunch of small channel cats no bigger than 8 inches each got about 3 of those. Then i hooked into something bigger a sheephead about a pound. Hours had past and ive already lost about 5 pickerel rigs, not even a nibble since the sheephead. The snags below the dam started to get frustrated so i went to the other side in search of better fishing. Well i got just that right off the bat a bigger channel cat about 12 inches and then another about the same size. We were running low on worms and wanted to try and get some pickerel so i walked down to fishmasters for leeches he was sold out so i picked up a bucket and a scoop of minnows. I returned to my spot and caught a sheephead and decided to go jig for some bass back at the dam. So back i went and after 5 minutes i hooked into something not a snag it was moving within seconds i saw it was a decent smallie about 12 inches. Not much longer i hooked into something small figured it to be a rock bass but it was a tiny smallie about 6 inches. These fish were caught on a yellow (blue eyed if it rlly matters) 1/8 ounce jig head with a small emerald shiner (thx steve). I decided to call it a day after that last bass and headed home quite satisfied. Got a bit brunt bit its alright better than staying home all day on the computer.   Bassmaster4"
