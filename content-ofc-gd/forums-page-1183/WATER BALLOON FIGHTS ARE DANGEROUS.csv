92538,fishnsled,2007-07-10 18:05:00,3520,Well that's going to leave a mark!!    I guess it could have been worst.    Speedy recovery!
92539,ccmtcanada,2007-07-10 18:06:00,7971,"ACK!!! It'll be hard to fish with a hand like that!!!  He almost looks proud of his ""war"" wounds!!  Ahh...the last water balloon fight I was in ended with me being banned from residence in university...apparently setting off fire alarms during final exams is frowned upon!!"
92540,tonyb,2007-07-10 18:09:00,1637,Ouch! If there is a will...there is a way...  My favorite phrase 'What are the chances!?'  Heres to a speedy recovery...hard to operate a weed-eater or lawnmower with a hand like that!
92547,BITEME,2007-07-10 18:20:00,1969,  i have the will there will be a way

92554,Stoty,2007-07-10 18:25:00,2910,"lets hope he's a ""righty"" "
92556,Tybo,2007-07-10 18:28:00,1373,"""Hey, hold my beer and watch this.......""  Sheesh, that looks painful Pete.  But remember at that age, nothing can hurt us  Joey"
92560,lunkerbasshunter,2007-07-10 18:33:00,2585,"the nurse was pretty cute, maybe a water ballon fight shoudl be in store for me tongiht.  Opps the wife is reading over my shoulder!"

92563,BITEME,2007-07-10 18:40:00,1969, Are you sure you got the nurse right is there something your wife should know!!!!!
92564,ccmtcanada,2007-07-10 18:41:00,7971, LOL...I wasn't going to say anything....but that Doctor sure is cute...the nurse...not really my style.
92565,BITEME,2007-07-10 18:44:00,1969,
92579,Bcee,2007-07-10 19:20:00,25,When I was 10 I was running while putting my filet knife in the sheath..buried it 3 inches into my thigh.  My dad was ticked. He had to take me from sandy Isle to Sturgeon Falls to find a Doc on a Sunday.  Lake was rough..i felt every chop!  LOL.  He still complains how ai robbed him of a Sunday of Fishing!
92646,motv8tr,2007-07-10 21:38:00,2587,OUCH!!!  That's gotta hurt....but I gotta say he doesn't look too upset...guess he liked the Doctor  .  Hope he didn't get any nerve damage.  Maureen
92648,Joey,2007-07-10 21:39:00,9122,  Didn't yo mamma teach you to never run with sharp objects     Scissors you can run with....    Joey
92657,aplumma,2007-07-10 21:58:00,6896,Don't let them get you down bud SCARS are cool and the more fun you had getting them the more they are worth. Man the joys of riding a bike without a helmet  or playing ro sham bo with out a cup are gone now with the over protective scar preventing measures that the parents are taking just make me sick. So go out and get a few new scars before you get old and have to pay for them... make sure they show so people will ask how they happened and you can tell them about the 5 guys that jumped you and one of them pulled a knife on yaa....... but you should have seen them when you were done. Tattoo's and piercings HA they aint so tough they were planned pain and a little bit of ink. They don't hold a candle to 15 stitches in the old brain bucket or getting that fingertip sewn back on that will never get the feeling back so you can stick pins in it without flinching. That my friend is nothing short of great entertainment. I guess alls I am saying is I hope you hand heals quickly be careful but still have fun.   Art
92658,aplumma,2007-07-10 22:00:00,6896,the board is a little squirrelly and seems to be doubling up on the posts.    Art

92671,Bly,2007-07-10 23:03:00,1556,"  Amen!!  Have a few scars myself that were earned while ""playing"" lol  As you said, they make for great stories later........  Hope the hand heals quickly and as for stories......""well, see, I was dangling my hand in the water and this huge musky came out of nowhere....... ""    That should keep the girlfriend close next time you are swimming in the Kawarthas  LOL"
