Interestingly, many of the lakers were caught trolling streamers on a long fly line......they are one fighting fish. Biggest disappointment was the pike fishing......only 3 between six of us for the week, although they ranged from 8-14 pounds.        Back to the French River in 2 weeks.......this retirement gig is a bear!"
