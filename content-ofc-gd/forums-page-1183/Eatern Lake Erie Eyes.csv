91868,bucktail,2007-07-09 00:10:00,1857,Hoping to try to figure out the eastern Erei eyes this year. I never seem to have much luck. Has anyone heard of any Erie reports for eyes yet this year. Willing to share the boat as well if someone could help me out. Have everything needed.
91871,charlied,2007-07-09 00:13:00,584,"well a month ago they were getting them 2 miles out of point abino...last I heard they were 5 miles out from port colbourne, you can never go wrong with fishing near the gas wells...which I think are about 5 miles out also.  I don't fish in a boat so this is second hand info and not sure if its true or not, hope it helps!"
