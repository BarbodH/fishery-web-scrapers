92242,Roy,2007-07-10 00:42:00,13728,"No Little Angler, fish are not safe to eat there. Drop them all off at Lakair Lodge and I will pick them up in late July for a proper autopsy. Thanks"

92326,motv8tr,2007-07-10 06:19:00,2587,"Go ahead little angler, the fish there are safe to eat...have a great time and don't forget to take your camera.  Maureen"
92392,tonyb,2007-07-10 12:52:00,1637,"...and remember to leave a small amount of skin on the fillets if you are planning to bring them home.  If you are checked by the MNR, they will ticket you for not having the skin on the fish for identification purposes.  Have a great trip and catch lots of bass!"
92399,lew,2007-07-10 13:13:00,12767,"Nippissing fish are most definetely good to eat, infact it's recommended by many of us  "
