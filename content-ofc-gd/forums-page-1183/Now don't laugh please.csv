92557,HookNrelease,2007-07-10 18:28:00,85,"Hey English, I enjoyed reading your posts and remembering the days,,,lol,, i came over from the North west, Lancs, 18 years ago, and now cant believe the salmon fishing we have here in Toronto, right on our doorstep, got the boat that we would never dream of back home, kitted out and ow my kids fight 30 pound plus salmon during the summer, sure beats heading up to Ulswater for a day of 2 lb browns and then to seaforth docks for flatties and makeral, Oh but i do miss the stop off in Blackpool on the way home at night,,,hahahaha. Its hard  for people here to understand that you need a seperate rod license for each county, plus you have to pay to fish or join a club to be able to fish anywhere except the sea. If your ever over this way we should set up an ENGLISH salmon charter trip...lol get all the expats on my small boat,,,hahahahha  cheers  Ian"

Couldn't understand a word anyone was saying...LOL.  Hey now  i sounmd somehwta like a yorkie...& you understand me.  Were you at the conference centre cliff?  Harrogate is a beautuful town they call it the snob town of yorkshire.....  English u must know about the famous bed races then? I was in it a couple of times myself all dressed up as...Well i'm not going to say!.  ..I got photo's too but no way am i posting em in here.   You must know mother of shiptons too? & yes indeed  small world.  The pub looks to have changed alot since i was living there what you can see as gardens now out back used to be just a graveled car park."
92585,007,2007-07-10 19:31:00,537,"English,  You're right - I'm certainly thinking twice about returning to England and not just because of the great fishing here in Ontario.  Unfortunately though I have to go where my job takes me and where I will have the best career prospects.  Though just iun case I will be looking into how to get Canadian residency status - not sure how easy that is though?  If it was a fishing decision - it would be an easy decision.  Compare my local day ticket fishing for tiny roach and perch in a muddy looking canal in London, England with fishing for huge carp and pike, hard fighting bass, beautiful looking sunfish and strange creatures like bullhead and bowfin in the 'clear' waters of the Toronto Islands (for free!).  There's no contest.  One good thing though about the UK is that you get a lot more holiday/vacation entitlement - so I could probably see/fish more of Ontario by coming over from the UK! Not quite so good on the bank balance though :-(  Cheers 007"
92936,njones,2007-07-11 16:13:00,24,"Hi, there, I see you're talking about me. I'm Neil, the buddy English was talking about. I was over in Ottawa in the first week of June, heading up to Lake Temagami for a week with 8 Canadians. Second time up there, weather not as good as last year, Caught northerns, lakers and walleye drank a lot of beer and rum. Stayed with Rick (used to be at Ketchn'any Lodge, now sold it and started up Wishn'you were fishin) really great guy, and his cabins are the best, even a hot tub. Also he keeps some 13 footers for hire on back lakes so you can portage in with a small outboard.  After a week up there, it was back to Ottawa for some fishing on the river and some good Canadian hospitality, plenty of beers and barbecues. Looking forward to next year."

92995,njones,2007-07-11 18:11:00,24,"Hi,mate, good to see you're enjoying the site. I was telling English in an e- mail that I'm going to the Isle of Man next wedneday. It's an island halfway betwwen England and Ireland, I'm hoping to fish off the jetties and even try to get a boat  out to do some sea- fishing. It's a lovely place and I'm looking forward to it   Though what chance have you got when there's a line of seals along the jetty, waiting for someone to catch a fish? You haul like crazy and you're lucky to haul out a pair of lips on your hook."
92439,John,2007-07-10 14:05:00,2956,"I too left for a new life in Canada. No question that in my opinion this is the best country in the world, bar none. However, let's not create a false impression of a country that still has some of the most magnificent scenery there is...  http://www.visitcumbria.com/amb/winderm.htm"
92447,lew,2007-07-10 14:13:00,12767," Your absolutely right John, I've been to England many times and it's a gorgeous country !!  My dad & his family emigrated from Derbyshire in 1930, but unfortunately I never got up to see his old hometown....maybe someday though."

92543,English,2007-07-10 18:12:00,90,"Hi guys, with all my moaning about the state of fishing over here I may have given off the wrong image like, don't get me wrong I love England whats left of it anyway, as Nautifish says we have some of the most beautiful scenery in the world, not saying ours is better or not, because  beauty is in the eye of the beholder, the lake district is purely magical, Wales and Scotland too. I guess you just have to be there to appreciate the atmosphere and all.  But we have our problems over here with the sucessive governments selling us down the drain to Europe, they won't let us have a referendum because they already know the outcome. There is virtually no border control and if you do make it over here, it takes the government so long to try and send you back you may as well buy a house and get rich. But get this if you don't have a passport? apparently they eat them on the plane on the way here?? Then they can't send you back because they don't know who you are or where you are from?? just apply for refugee status and you are in?? Something to do with the stupid human rights act which is supposed to protect the innocent but has been all bent out of shape by the crooked lawyers and now favours the criminals, the work shy and illegals get that!  As I said we have our problems but there are a lot of pluses. You are not going to get your house shaken to the ground by an earth quake or the roof ripped off by a tornado, forest fires are usually under control in a day or so and no one looses there house because of them, you can camp in the woods and not worry about getting eaten by bears or midges. In winter only in the most remote places you may be snowed in for a day or so and I don't think I have ever lost a days work because of it. It goes down to about -5 only on the coldest days ever nearly tropical I hear you say  Our summers are something else you can get all 4 seasons in one day but you are guaranteed it won't get too hot for long like it nearly got to 100F last year the hottest day on record but mostly you can be sure 80F is the hottest alright if you are not a sun worshipper like myself. Hardly any houses are built with aircon mostly for offices that stuff.  Any way back to the fishing, I started off fishing like most lads when I was 4 years old for newts, stickle back, minnows gudgeon and bleak in the pond out back and canals and rivers locally, my grandfather thought it would be a good idea to take me fishing with him one day and that was that. And i have loved it ever since, I think I remember that we didn't catch much that day and as he lived miles away he left his gear at ours promising one day to come back and do it again but we never did. I used to practice in the back garden casting and that, I am sure most of us have done that at some point. I used to be allowed to go over the back on my own and we used to fish for newts in the pond with bits of chopped worm. When I was about 7 I used to be allwed down the local river which was 3ft deep and about 10ft wide so not much chance of drowning. I think back to what it was like then and it is a shame that kids over here nowdays aren't allowed out on there own until they are about 12 and older and that would only be to play next door or something like. If we caught a dozen fish then we had a good day, we had no idea really how to fish properly but all part of learning and life, happy days. The Thames at Weybridge was about 25mins on our pushbikes and a pint of maggots used to last 3 of us all daywe used to catch hundreds of bleak then basically the Thames then was slowly being poisoned by all the businesses pouring their waste straight into it. Thank god the NRA National rivers Authority was set up to deal with the problem, it took them a while but now there is a good head of carp in there and as I said earlier trout and salmon are back but in a small way still could take ages who knows.  007 Thigs have changed quite a bit here, if I were you I might think twice about coming back, but if you do hope it aaall goes well for you.  APLUMMA thanks for the offer maybe in about 5 years when the business is all ticking along nicely and the kids are a bit older that would be one of my dreams fulfilled.  Nautifish small world isn't it used to go out with a girl from Knaresborough, Yorkshire and I used to try and practice the accent lol nice website the pub has got if I am ever up that way I may pop in.  My mate Neil who recommended I pop in here and take a look lives in Durham, he fishes in Canada 2 or 3 times a year on Lake Temagami mostly, he has some mates from up that way who I presume get on here?  Thanks for not laughing all.  Tight lines"
