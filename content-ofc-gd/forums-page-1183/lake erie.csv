92282,sonny,2007-07-10 02:03:00,511,"nope not at all,, they have to be screened very carefully,,,drop them off to me and i'll let you know if they are ok to eat!!!"
92283,bassmaster4,2007-07-10 02:04:00,801,lol ok thanks i was wondering because of the carp dying and everything thats in the great lakes right?
92284,waterboy,2007-07-10 02:05:00,17,I'll second that.  LOL!
92286,Jen,2007-07-10 02:08:00,833,"Bassmaster4,  There has been a lot of talk about fish consumption from the great lakes... I was at a fish fry yesterday, with ppl who eat fish from erie all the time... and let me tell you, the almost 90 year old man there looked very healthy to me.  I haven't read what the book on consumption says, but there is nothing wrong with a walleye or perch dinner ever now and again.  Enjoy your day,  Jen"
92290,bassmaster4,2007-07-10 02:11:00,801,thanks a lot Jen
92291,pikehunter,2007-07-10 02:15:00,1659," Yep, but that green glowing hue to his skin looked a little peculiar though.  We have had several meals of L. Erie perch this year, one thing I liked was that there was not one grub or worm in any of them. I wish I could say the same for L. Simcoe perch"
92294,fliptheslop,2007-07-10 02:20:00,112,"they saynone of the lakes that areaffected posse any risk, Im not sure how they make this claim, but cant tell anyone what the problem is"
92385,Landlocked,2007-07-10 12:35:00,171,Erie is the cleanest of all the Great Lakes if that helps!
92418,nautifish,2007-07-10 13:34:00,1416,  Yup it is....I fish LE all the time have eaten alot of perch from this lake. Am not glowing or got three eyes well not yet anyways!
92476,ccmtcanada,2007-07-10 14:50:00,7971, I heard that guy was actually 35 years old  hehehehe.
92478,ccmtcanada,2007-07-10 14:53:00,7971,"bassmaster...if you are concerned, just read this....it's the Guide to Eating Sportfish in Ontario...this link is specifically for Lake Erie...  http://www.ene.gov.on.ca/publications/590b13-LE.pdf  After glancing at it quickly, it appears perch are fine if you are just eating a few!"
92480,shawnf,2007-07-10 14:55:00,46,"The 20+ walleye we ate from there turned out fine, and yes.... everyone is still alive."
