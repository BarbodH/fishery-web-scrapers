91292,Scott,2007-07-06 13:41:00,7,"Hi,  I'm posting this for a friend who is FINALLY getting out with his brother this weekend in Quebec.  If anyone can provide shore fishing information or spots to try around Campbell's Bay or Fort Coulonge it would be great for them.  They don't get together often and would like to help them out.  Maybe there's a guide around you could recommend as a last resort.  Thanks."
92090,Scott,2007-07-09 16:49:00,7,Lets try this again.   Please.
92170,Stoty,2007-07-09 19:43:00,2910,This is the OFC (Ontario Fishing network). Maybe try searching for a Quebec fishing forum?
92171,Roy,2007-07-09 19:50:00,13728,"Scott, Campbell's Bay is sitting in one of the best fishing areas in the country. Anywhere on the Ottawa River they'll be able to get LM bass, SM bass, pike, muskie and walleye."
92174,Zamboni,2007-07-09 20:07:00,235,"Ottawa River is the Quebec-Ont border there Stoty-their fishing the river West of Ottawa almost to Pembrooke. Not sure on shore fishing Scott but its great area for eyes, 2 friends both got PB's near Calumet from boat on same evening."
92198,darsky,2007-07-09 21:13:00,586,Stoty-how old are you?
92300,Stoty,2007-07-10 02:51:00,2910,25
92377,Scott,2007-07-10 12:09:00,7,"Thanks for the info.  Link to FishHawk pm'd to me, guy says there are lots of Quebec fisherman there.  Hey stoty, if you're going to post something useless like that, why don't you do something decent and include a link or at least recommend another site.  I don't need bold letters to see Ontario, i'm 31 and not stupid.  Seems like you wrote that just to see yourself and show those who see it your maturity level.  Cheers."
92379,lew,2007-07-10 12:18:00,12767," Stoty, we've got alot of members on OFC from Quebec, who offer plenty of useful information for those of us us who travel there.  We've also got plenty of members from Ontario who fish Quebec on a regular basis and can also offer advice to those who ask.  This board isn't just limited to Ontario."
92380,Stoty,2007-07-10 12:21:00,2910,"Don't see what is immature about that. Don't you think that someone would have better luck finding out about spots in Quebec, from a site based on that?"
92394,Guest Trophymuskie,2007-07-10 13:01:00,0, I'm sure you could find him an English Quebec site as well.
92401,Stoty,2007-07-10 13:17:00,2910,"Google, is a wonderful thing. These are all fishing in Quebec sites, in english. I am sure one of these would have the information he is looking for.  http://www.quebecfishing.net/ http://www.lodgesresorts.com/Quebec/quebec-fishing.html http://www.infohub.com/Lodgings/fishing_lo...ing_lodges.html http://www.fishingcanada.com/Quebec/ http://www.advancedbassin.com/  Don't understand why people are taking offense to my post. I was simply making a suggestion about looking up Quebec site, they would probably have lots of info on Quebec fishing."
92405,Whopper,2007-07-10 13:22:00,2174, Amen to that Lew
92412,Stoty,2007-07-10 13:29:00,2910,"I wasnt saying that it was, but that he might want to check out a forum that is based on Quebec fishing. That might have more detailed info about the location he is looking for."
92419,Scott,2007-07-10 13:37:00,7,"Thanks for the links stoty, i've sent them off to him.  Bolding to make a point has tone to it, thats all.  Same idea for writing in capital letters and yelling.  Cheers."
92420,Stoty,2007-07-10 13:42:00,2910,Your welcome for the links.  I am sorry if I offended you by the bolding. Didn't mean for it to be taken as a negative tone.
92421,Scott,2007-07-10 13:45:00,7,No worries.  Good luck with the rest of your season.
92423,Stoty,2007-07-10 13:47:00,2910,"Thanks, you too!"
92426,Zamboni,2007-07-10 13:50:00,235,"Lets not get too sensitive here guys-Stoty's post is far from offensive. Mine pointing out to Stoty that Ottawa river is border etc could be taken wrong way also.  I sometimes visit GTHL hockey forums on N54 to see whats going on with sons opponents. Posts there are as bad as the net can get-people slaming 10 year old kids, coaches, teamates-each others wifes!....nothing is off limits. This site is great with so few arguments."
92454,Guest Trophymuskie,2007-07-10 14:20:00,0, Wow you had me fooled I tought one of those may actually lead to an English message board.
92458,Stoty,2007-07-10 14:24:00,2910,Doesn't have to be a forum to have good info on it.
