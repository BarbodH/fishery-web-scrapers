The weather proved to be unpredictable but we still found time to wet a line between thunder storms, canoeing and beer drinking.  The owner of the cottage said the bass fishing was great and one of the best spots was off the point just at the end of his land.  Well he wasn't lying...  Here's my Dad with a well deserved smallie on our first morning...    Later that evening we got back at it.  I landed this guy on my first cast using a skitter pop...    A storm was rolling in quick and offered up some great scenery before it hit...      As the days went on the fishing action didn't fade.  At dusk I got into bass after bass on the trustworthy dew worm rig...        It was quite the task keeping them out of this stuff once hooked, the bass were putting up a great fight...    Our final morning we got up early, despite the hangover, and headed back to the point for one last kick at the action.  Turned out to be a great way to end the trip...  My Dad picks up this brute minutes after our first cast...    Followed shortly by this scrapper that gave me a good go...      Next up my sister gets into the action and lands this...    I had a great trip and look forward to returning next year for a rematch.  We found that there was a small window of when the bass were on but the slightest cold front moving in could shut them off quickly.  Big thanks to Hookset for giving me some insight on this lake.  Much appreciated man.  Corn Nug"
