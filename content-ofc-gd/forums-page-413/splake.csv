692058,Christopheraaron,2012-05-01 23:32:00,3525,"I've been thinking of spending a little time this summer targeting splake up in algonquin because I know that there are a few lakes just off of 60 that have in the past been stocked. I could use a few pointers on tactics, depth, etc. Also, does anyone know if we're counting splake in the tournament this year? I am not sure if they are present in algonquin or anyplace nearby but info on tigertrout would also be appreciated."
692060,Christopheraaron,2012-05-01 23:37:00,3525,"Just ran a quick search and realized how rare they are to catch, maybe I'll just stick to splake."
692061,Nipfisher,2012-05-01 23:41:00,2449,????????? Splake in both posts????????? What are rare and what are you going to target instead?
692062,Christopheraaron,2012-05-01 23:42:00,3525,tiger trout = rare spake =target
692064,Roy,2012-05-01 23:51:00,13728,"Tigers are probably less abundant than auroras. Splake is a nice fish that is reasonably easy to find but if it's just for the OFC tourney, I'd go for lakers. You'll score a lot more inches with lakers than splakes for the tournament in the NGL category.."
692066,Christopheraaron,2012-05-01 23:54:00,3525," Ya, more reason to chase them though. Although I'd rather catch an aurora. Wouldn't just be fishing for the inches, just heard that they aren't too hard to catch and put up one heluva fight!"
692116,mikeseb,2012-05-02 03:02:00,201,"tigertrout?  dont think ive ever heard of them before, with a name like that they defiantly sound like a wild catch!"
692117,BillM,2012-05-02 03:11:00,17367,"Tiger trout, half brookie half brownie..  Goodluck ever catching one of those, lol."
692134,Gregoire,2012-05-02 11:08:00,1397,"The Tiger trout are really cool. I'm really interested if anyone has caught one. As far a splake fishing goes, earlier in the year is your best bet. I have had some luck in July with 3 way swivels in July. Much like lake trout, splake go deep when the water warms up."
