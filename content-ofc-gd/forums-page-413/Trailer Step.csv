690903,mercman,2012-04-28 16:16:00,7054,"A little while back, i posted asking for info on where i could get some sort of step, that i could use to get out of the boat, after trailering it alone at the boat ramp. I really didnt want to risk breaking an ankle jumping from the boat to the uneven ground of my local ramp. The other day, a member who will remain anonymous, sent me a PM, showing me what he had just purchased at Princess Auto. Simon  said it had cost him 24.99 plus tax. I replied that, that was exactly what i was looking for, and could he pick one up for me . He replied that he already had picked up a second one for me . I cant believe the goodness of the members in this Community. I received it on wednesday by puro, and here is what it looks like. It adjusts to 5 different heights  and is very solid.  Thanks a million anonymous member You are a great friend and a good man.    Another idea i had. A tool pouch from CT. held to the console with a brass drawer handle keeps all your fishing tools at hand. They do not fall out while traveling.I have driven hundreds  of miles and have never had a tool come out of its place. "
690906,DRIFTER_016,2012-04-28 16:29:00,10439,Nice!!! Here is a Link to purchase online direct from Princess Auto for those who want one but don't live any where near a store.
690908,mike rousseau,2012-04-28 16:54:00,4661,Nice mods Paul... Your becoming an efficient fishing machine!!!!
691034,skeeter,2012-04-29 00:46:00,1907,To bad he can't spell.  Pricess Auto.  :rofl2:
691036,Rod Caster,2012-04-29 00:54:00,5784,"That's a nice looking mod. Easy on the ankles and fairly priced, too.  When are you installing that hockey stick spoiler?"
691038,mrpike,2012-04-29 00:57:00,151,Now that step is just the cat's ass man . I got to get me one.  MAYBE TWO ONE FOR EACH SIDE. O YA!!!
691068,Joeytier,2012-04-29 01:46:00,3990,
691075,Mike the Pike,2012-04-29 02:11:00,3421,Jeez Paul you are way too organized.Do you have a little red carpet that I walk on before I step in to your boat.  You have just as many gadgets as a swiss army knife and the boat is the same colour  Ok I must admit all looks good looking forward to fishing with you bud.  Oh and you need to leave the boat motor  muffs at unless you use those on your ears  Mike 
691099,mercman,2012-04-29 03:02:00,7054," Only the boat is organized.Hell, you saw my office If my boat was like that, i would be shore fishing I am really looking forward to fishing with you also.  Paul"
691162,Billy Bob,2012-04-29 13:11:00,5865,How PURDY.....now what's it for....
691329,mercman,2012-04-30 01:54:00,7054," Maybe this will help answer that question Bob    ""Say hello to my little friend"""
691644,Leecher,2012-04-30 22:24:00,7832,Nice mods Paul  Ya can't be too careful around a fishing rig when comes time to pull it out of the water at any boat ramp   The step will most certainly be practical and safe for you to get in and out
691729,tb4me,2012-05-01 00:45:00,3295,Nice freakin boat! Love it
691736,Mike the Pike,2012-05-01 01:06:00,3421,You really have that thing well laid out.  An organized fishing machine.  MTP
691745,mercman,2012-05-01 01:28:00,7054,"thanks guys  Its just right for what i need. She's a small boat, 16ft, so no big water for me.I did have her out on St Francis in 3 ft waves.It was interesting LOL."
691761,DRIFTER_016,2012-05-01 01:52:00,10439, With enough experience you can handle some really snotty water in a 16 footer. Spent a year guiding in a 16' Lund and was caught out in some nasty waves (to 10') on many occasions and was never worried.
691781,mike rousseau,2012-05-01 02:58:00,4661,  Interesting.... That's an understatement.... You got so frustrated we ended up taking the big ranger out... I thought I was gunna need gloves for you to hold the musky we got...lol  It was blowing pretty good that day tho.... And waves are shaped different on a river.... I think the wind was against the current as well... That makes big sharp waves...
691783,DRIFTER_016,2012-05-01 03:22:00,10439," Shallow lakes produce sharp, close together waves as well. I like big, deep lake waves much better. 5'-6' waves on Erie are painful."
691784,kickingfrog,2012-05-01 03:31:00,8333," Ya, I've heard Lake Winnipeg is real bad because of that."
691786,DRIFTER_016,2012-05-01 03:36:00,10439,"  Yep, as well as Nipissing."
691801,Billy Bob,2012-05-01 10:35:00,5865,"Been out MANY times on Lake Erie in my 16' Grumman fishing for walleyes during tournaments, etc when Lake Erie was ANGRY......but that was when I was much younger.....many times I caught so many walleyes during these blows I didn't know what to do with all of them, while looking for MR 12 pounder...."
691812,Fish4Eyes,2012-05-01 11:53:00,1022," It is actually ""too bad"" and not ""to bad"", wise guy.  Edited for Billy Bob."
691814,Billy Bob,2012-05-01 11:58:00,5865," Correct me if I'm wrong....but wouldn't that be ""Princess"" Auto"
