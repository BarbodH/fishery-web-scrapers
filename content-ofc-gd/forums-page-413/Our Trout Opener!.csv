692099,The Urban Fisherman,2012-05-02 02:27:00,2050,Thanks for all the great reply's guys - I've been busy but will get to them shortly...    This is a small part of why I'm busy and the reason Will and I didn't get much sleep saturday night.. lol  
692172,wildeye rainbow,2012-05-02 13:38:00,123,Nice fish and nice pups!  Did the early bird catch the worm or were the fish biting later in the morning?  I find that later in the day is best both for traffic and fish - I was on a stream with no one else around except for footprints of the early risers.
691378,The Urban Fisherman,2012-04-30 13:13:00,2050,"Hey Guys!  Mike & Danna Parker put on an amazing facebook auction to help raise money for our Fish-A-Thon for a cure and it turned out to be a complete success!  I donated a modest prize which was an exclusive day out on my local lake fishing trout for opener.  The cool thing is that the park isn't open yet, so aside from a couple of shore anglers and 2 people who dragged little boats in from shore we pretty well had the entire lake to ourselves.  My good buddy Will ( fishnsled ) from here on OFC bid A HUNDRED BUCKS to fish opener with me.. poor guy haha  We've been trying to hit the water for over 5 years, as we used to work together when I was back in Toronto.  This was long overdue and we had an awesome time!  Will came by Saturday night, we drank a few cold ones, talked fishing, and barely got any sleep at all due to the fact that my Dog had puppies! lol In the end I couldn't have asked for a better trout opener  Onto the fishing - We struggled all morning (could have slept in haha) but with some help from the graph we located some fish and after changing up the game plan a few times we finally laid a pretty good beat down on them.  It turned out to be a great trout opener and multi species day!  Thanks again for everything Will - I had a ton of fun and look forward to doing it again.... and it better not take 5 years this time!  Feel free to fill in the blanks as I had to rush this report through!  Frozen blueberry bushes on our way to the lake...            I thought I was supposed to be the guide? lol                       Will was the rock bass master today.. he hammered a bunch! lol heres a couple bigger ones..      Check this out... this guy was full of shiners and had a big goby in him and he still ate my bait! lol    Last nights snack...   Have a good week folks!  Cheers, Ryan"
691383,Harrison,2012-04-30 13:28:00,2202,Awesome.  Will's a great guy and fun to fish with.  Have to do something about his hat though....
691388,Roy,2012-04-30 13:33:00,13728,Wow! What a report! Those browns are my favorite. Really good photos too. Thanks.
691389,Ralph Field,2012-04-30 13:38:00,1018,A better opener is hard to imagine.
691390,asdve23rveavwa,2012-04-30 13:39:00,2690,"Nicely done guys!!  Good seeing you both out there.  Definitely a slow morning bite with those -4 overnight temps. Big round of applause for Will, and, his Fishing For A Cure bid!!!"
691396,The Urban Fisherman,2012-04-30 13:53:00,2050,Bonus pictures - Averie introducing the next generation... her baby sister!  
691429,chuckymcd,2012-04-30 14:53:00,144,"Those are some killer fish man, good job! those brownies are fantastic looking fish!"
691474,fishnsled,2012-04-30 17:35:00,3520,"It certainly was an awesome day Ryan and looooong over do. Nice to know that the Fish-A-Thon for a Cure will benefit as well from our day on the water too. Thanks Mike and Danna for putting together the auction. Certainly a day that I will remember for a long time.   Sorry Phil.    Nice to meet you as well. I told Ryan that we could sleep in and the bite would be better after 11.  No applause necessary but I am looking for pledges for the Fish-A-Thon in July.  If a got a buck or 2 from all the members here, that would certainly bump up the totals in July.    Cool pic. Thanks again for a great day Ryan and looking forward to the Fish-A-Thon in July."
691477,rocheleauc,2012-04-30 17:37:00,205,well done
691509,Realsteel19,2012-04-30 18:39:00,19,WOW to the SHINERS!
691515,Spiel,2012-04-30 18:44:00,9065,"Awesome, simply awesome!"
691528,lovetofish,2012-04-30 19:04:00,500,Love the colors and spots on those fish!  Thanks for sharing  LTF
691565,Moosebunk,2012-04-30 20:12:00,3970,Beautiful pics and a great combo of fish.  Awesome stuff!
691637,Headhunter,2012-04-30 21:57:00,5703,"Great pics guys! (Better be good pics from you guys!) Those browns look killer! Just so yah know, never get in the way of FnS when there's a foot pedal involved! HH"
691667,Leecher,2012-04-30 23:06:00,7832,NICE    The colors on those browns are stunning Awesome opener for sure Congrats Ryan and Will   :clapping:
691672,spincast,2012-04-30 23:16:00,3279,Wow - sleep deprivation obviously sharpens your guys skills - these are some beauty browns
691676,misfish,2012-04-30 23:26:00,29133,OMG thats a fat one.     Great outing guys.
691697,FisherJuli,2012-04-30 23:56:00,125,"Great icy pics, and of course the fish are beautiful!! But nothing beats Avery passing on her knowledge to her little sister. Very nice donation, Ryan... It can be very rewarding to fish with a 'master' of the area, and you proved it!! I fished it the afternoon before you, and only managed some blue gills!!"
691721,Victor,2012-05-01 00:29:00,1609,The colors on those fish are phenomenal! Great pics and congrats on a successful opener Ryan!
691725,Twocoda,2012-05-01 00:40:00,4130,Nice shootin bois!!
691758,limeyangler,2012-05-01 01:47:00,5204,Ryan.......speechless....what a great report....love the blueberry shots....and nice to see avery sorting out the next generation.  I am in awe of your multi species opener....what a fantastic day!
691891,fishnsled,2012-05-01 15:35:00,3520," LOL!! We mixed up the boat control through out the day. Given the lack of sleep it was quite nice to chill at the back of the boat and catch fish.      I don't know if it (lack of sleep) sharpened our skills or just the fact we just got lazy and slowed down the presentation.    It was a great donation!! It finally got us both in a boat for a day (after all those years of trying) and a few bucks to a very worthy cause. The fish - a bonus and certainly nice to fish with the ""master"" even if I had charge the batteries, hook up the boat to the truck, load the gear, tow, launch, drive the boat..... yep Ryan is a good guide. 	We actually made a great team on and off the water, had an incredible day filled with lots of laughs and fish. VERY much looking forward to the next trip."
691974,highdrifter,2012-05-01 19:10:00,2534,Not too shabby brother!  Some inquiring minds want to know how you pegged them beauties..  What did you use?!  FnS that ain't a shimano magnumlite you're casting is it?  cheers HD
691976,fishnsled,2012-05-01 19:24:00,3520," I have one of those at home, baitcaster, that I still use for muskies. The rod in the shot is an old Shimano Speedmaster. Good eye."
691991,highdrifter,2012-05-01 20:04:00,2534, I still have my ultra light magnum with the aero guides...  Great rods!!
