After a long search, I was unable to find some replacement co-pilot rod clips, so I decided to post here to see if anyone had any.  Limey Angler said he had a couple and would mail them to me....sure enough they arrived in the mail today.  Class act."

692263,johnnyb,2012-05-02 19:10:00,3413,Limey is class all the way.  Except for when he posts walleye through the ice while we are still on softwater in November....or April.  Or when he posts tank smallmouth in April and May.  Or when he posts pics of launching in his backyard and catching muskie in view of the house.  Man that guy really burns me up!
