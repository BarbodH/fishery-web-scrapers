690726,irishfield,2012-04-27 22:32:00,26272,That's one small picture.. but it sure looks like Ontario's finest game fish to me! A rock bass...
690727,skidoosafari,2012-04-27 22:34:00,46,Oops guess I should have resized.  Have to work on that.
690728,Joeytier,2012-04-27 22:34:00,3990,Just a rock bass...I mean WOW sweet rock bass!!!
690730,Nipfisher,2012-04-27 22:40:00,2449,Yep a rock bass (that is crappie to catch). We get them pretty big here in a few local lakes and they can get really dark mid summer.
690741,skidoosafari,2012-04-27 23:16:00,46, Yes we get some monsters up at my camp. ( suburbs of barrys bay! ) lol
690760,Christopheraaron,2012-04-28 00:03:00,3525,"I didn't realize how big it was when I caught it , last year in AP I caught a rock bass that must of been about 2.5 pounds, pretty close to an ontario record"
692120,98Fahrenheit,2012-05-02 03:24:00,108,That's a rock bass ... not a cross ...
692122,mikeseb,2012-05-02 03:39:00,201," A buddy of mine got one that was at least 2 pounds maybe more last summer, i wish i would weighed it now lol  they get pretty big if theres not many other fish to compete with for food, there very aggressive and will eat almost anything"
