Got into a hole pile of these little guys...  http://i867.photobucket.com/albums/ab236/lovetofish123/2012-04-29090248.jpg  http://i867.photobucket.com/albums/ab236/lovetofish123/536423_10150859998505351_589895350_12163307_1019983736_n.jpg  http://i867.photobucket.com/albums/ab236/lovetofish123/2012-04-29090323.jpg  All fish were caught beside or underneath fallen trees, on salmon roe.  Maybe because the water was so clear?  A little bigger...  http://i867.photobucket.com/albums/ab236/lovetofish123/2012-04-29110650.jpg  We also walked up on a huge dead turkey!  http://i867.photobucket.com/albums/ab236/lovetofish123/2012-04-29092134.jpg   Some scenery pics...  http://i867.photobucket.com/albums/ab236/lovetofish123/545672_10150859995375351_589895350_12163288_345346752_n.jpg  http://i867.photobucket.com/albums/ab236/lovetofish123/529972_10150859997655351_589895350_12163305_1000113658_n.jpg  http://i867.photobucket.com/albums/ab236/lovetofish123/522849_10150859996290351_589895350_12163296_773567873_n.jpg  Turned out to be a pretty nice day!  http://i867.photobucket.com/albums/ab236/lovetofish123/545983_10150859994350351_589895350_12163284_162450737_n.jpg  It was a great day, caught some fish and we walked and walked and walked.

691533,BillM,2012-04-30 19:08:00,17367, Steelhead smolts...  If you get into a bunch of them it's wise to move to a different run/drift.
