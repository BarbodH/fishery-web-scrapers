Half the fun with these trips is just getting out and enjoying the drive, the scenery and the company.. or at least I tell myself that to help cope with all the lost lures, money spent on gas and empty-handed drives home. No, seriously, I like getting out regardless!  This mission was to an undisclosed lake known to be stocked with specks; this was also a return trip, as an earlier visit had unfortunately yielded sights of ice still skimming the water's surface. Fortunately this time the ice was gone and the back roads a little firmer.  The sun was out but the wind stole any heat it provided and gave us chills. We were hiking in with an assortment of spinners, but unfortunately no worms. Those guys seem tough to find out on the shield. Having not brought the canoe, we were very limited to the spots we could fish, though we found a couple.    Between the couple of spots we had available to us, we spent most of our time there casting out into open water. I appreciate the lack of hidden rocks and stumps as I've lost enough lures to them on recent trips out, but I know it doesn't make for the best trout fishing. After some time with no results, I began to have that doubt in my mind - are there fish here? Or is it just me? I started looking to a more promising spot nearby, though fishing it would mean walking out onto a narrow tree that had fallen into the water. Deciding to risk it, I edged out as far as I could go and began casting toward submerged logs and grass. After a while of this that same doubt began to creep back into my mind.. but was then cast out by a fish breaking the water, likely going after one of the million little flies buzzing about. I didn't see it but it was enough to keep me going. Shortly after that, my girlfriend came over to ask how much longer we were staying. I cast, turned and said quietly as possible, ""A fish just broke the surface-"" ..and before I could even look back, there it was - that familiar pull, my rod tip bent over, a fish was on the line.    I tried to be patient, keeping the line tight and reeling when possible. Soon enough I could see the trout through the water, fighting my line, flashing it's white belly, diving and pitching about. I could only bring it in so far before I found myself trapped on my tree and unable to do too much. My girlfriend came over as near as she could and took the rod, and I dropped down, straddling the tree between my legs, trying to reach in for the trout. It had gotten the line twisted around fallen branches and I was worried the line would snap or it would spit the hook. After it's fight though, it was tired, and after a few more struggles I managed to break off the tangled branches and lift him out of the water and get back on shore.     The colors were beautiful, pics don't do him justice, but I'm sure I don't need to tell you guys. Admittedly I don't like killing, but I'd been hunting for a speck for a while so he was coming home. I dispatched him quickly, and shortly after we headed out for the drive back. Not much for size or quantity, but man, what a satisfying day!  4lb mono with a small black snap swivel, small Panther Martin."
