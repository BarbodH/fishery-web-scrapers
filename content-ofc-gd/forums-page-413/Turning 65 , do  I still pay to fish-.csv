692319,Jer,2012-05-02 20:27:00,1426,"   I was just speaking for myself personally when I go fishing from my dock for a few hours, usually no more than a mile from home. I have my boat, my boater's card, my fishing license and my phone, they'll figure out who I am soon enough. I wasn't in any way advocating for everyone in every situation to go without their wallet, that's your choice. When I'm away from home, of course I carry my wallet like everyone else."
692338,Big Cliff,2012-05-02 21:44:00,6899,"ID? Heck, I can go into almost any store in town and give them my phone number and they can tell me where I live, how old I am, how many credit cards I have, if I'm married or single, what my annual income is and a whole bunch of other stuff about me.  The Canadian Government needs my birth certificate, SIN number, Mothers maiden name, date of birth, drivers license number and secret pass word (who the hell can remember that?) and they still don't have a clue who I am.  I hardly ever carry ID with me any more, I'd forget I had it anyway. If I get stopped for anything I just give them a blank stare and when they ask me how old I am I just mumble something about ""almost as old as beans"". With that they usually just shake their head, tell me to drive carefully and to have a good day.  Who needs ID when you are almost as old as my buddy Beans?"

692032,npt1,2012-05-01 22:27:00,220,"Hi all, I am turning 65 soon and I would like to know if I can fish for free or do I need to purchase anything?  Thanks for your help. Sarmoti."
692035,davey buoy,2012-05-01 22:30:00,5505," 65 plus,no licence ,just make sure you have id. I do believe you have to abide by the conservation licence limits.Good luck."
692037,grt1,2012-05-01 22:31:00,638,"you will need a licence up to your birthday, last year i turned 65 in october so i had to buy one for the year. if you turn 65 before the season starts you won't need one, but if the season starts before your birthday and you plan on fishing don't tempt fate, spend the money and get one."
692038,lew,2012-05-01 22:31:00,12766,No license required once you reach 65 but you'll need I.D. to prove your age if the police or CO's question you.
692043,solopaddler,2012-05-01 22:49:00,8605,Yeah what the other guys said....assuming of course you're a resident of Ontario.
692044,irishfield,2012-05-01 22:49:00,26272," Then you'd believe wrong. Under 18 and 65+ have the right to a full Sport limit, as do those that hold Handicap permits."
692047,davey buoy,2012-05-01 23:04:00,5505," Well I'll be damned,always heard that from my father.Thanks for the correction."
692049,Roy,2012-05-01 23:15:00,13728, Or a resident of the rest of Canada.
692055,kickingfrog,2012-05-01 23:23:00,8333,Glad some others were able to step up with the answer. I am far too young to have known.
692074,grt1,2012-05-02 00:30:00,638,"now i know you are supposed to be able to prove your age, but i just checked my outdoors card and it has the date of my birth embossed on it. since it is a document issued by the provincial government , shouldn't it count as proof of age? Is it really necessary to carry a drivers licence or some other document?"
692079,BillM,2012-05-02 00:36:00,17367,"No you need a ID such as a drivers license, passport, healthcard to prove age.  Not a previous outdoors card.  My oldman just brings his drivers license along."
692082,Roy,2012-05-02 00:57:00,13728,Doesn't everyone just keep their wallet on them at all times?
692100,mike rousseau,2012-05-02 02:28:00,4661,  I know eh...  Like its safer sitting in the truck at the launch...  Considering I need my boating licence as well as multiple fishing licenses... It all goes with me...
692102,Beans,2012-05-02 02:32:00,3339,I use my senior citizen card the federal government sends you just to remind you that you are getting old...
692107,grt1,2012-05-02 02:37:00,638,"I don't have a seniors card, when i called service canada because i hadn't recieved one, they told me they had run out of them and were hoping to get more, then play catch up with the waiting list for those who need them."
692132,Jer,2012-05-02 10:24:00,1426,"   Not necessarily, when fishing from home my wallet stays in the house. Boaters Card is in the boat, fishing license is in the tackle box, what would I need my wallet for?"
692145,mike rousseau,2012-05-02 12:00:00,4661, ID... A $20 for when you break down and need a tow from a fellow boater...or gas...  ID for emergency situations...  Organ doner info...
692149,Jer,2012-05-02 12:07:00,1426,
692168,mike rousseau,2012-05-02 13:32:00,4661,"so i guess with reasoning like that you never carry a wallet...?    i guess its a bit different for me here... im on the st.lawrence river... i buy my gas and food on the water by boat... i also cross into NY state and Quebec by boat... and there is the possibility of being hit by an ocean liner if i get stuck in the channel...im not fishing a little back country lake where everyone knows you by name...  as for the $20 for a tow... nobody ""charges"" for a tow here either... but if i spend a good chunk of my day off and a bunch of my gas towing you so you dont have to paddle and waist the rest of your day....and a $20 is offered... i dont hesitate to take it... and if i ever do need a tow... ill be more then happy to give the guy that helps me a $20...last time i towed a boat it was huge and i burnt about $15 in gas and an hour and a half of my day on the water...i actually had to go get gas right after i left em at the dock...waisting another 45 mintues... so as a boater that has lost track of how many boats ive towed compared to myself who has never been towed... i appreciated the ""thank you"" $20 i got for my troubles... i dont go into the situation thinkin ""this guy better have money for me""...and im not upset if its not offered... but its nice to be able to replace the gas i burnt helping them...  i wish i could leave my wallet at home when i went fishing and leave society behind like you..."
692169,BillM,2012-05-02 13:33:00,17367,"ID isn't for you, it's for someone else to identify you...  I didn't realize that actually had to be explained to someone."
692170,mike rousseau,2012-05-02 13:33:00,4661,    and notify family in an emergency   ...
692174,lew,2012-05-02 13:48:00,12766," Don't worry about it Mike, those things can stop on a dime"
692181,dave524,2012-05-02 14:02:00,4508,"I just carry all my fishing , hunting , boating, firearms and radio stuff in a separate small wallet. If you hunt you still gotta keep up the outdoors card and hunting licenses, still a couple of years from 65. The sport has sure got buried in paperwork over the last 50 years"
692218,bigugli,2012-05-02 16:33:00,6138,Makes it easier to identify the corpses bobbing face first in the water
692226,BillM,2012-05-02 16:48:00,17367, You got it! LOL!
