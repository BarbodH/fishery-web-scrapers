I am fairly new in the steelheading and river fishing, this being my 2nd opener.  Last year I got skunked and only managed one all last year.  This year I was determend to get into some fish.  I was out of the house at 4:30 and at the river by 5:30.  It didnt take long to get into the first one, a little shaker.  Then I had to re-tie and first drift after I hooked into my PB!  All in all went 2/2 in 2 hours of fishing, all fish were returned to the river to live another day!  Cant wait to get back out!  "

691664,spincast,2012-04-30 22:59:00,3279,Nice shootin - nothing wrong with that score for opening day  -  you must have walked a ways to catch 'em - cause every opener I used to do there was always more people on the bank than fish in the river - even after a 2 hour drive and a 45 minute hike. Mostly the reason I dont do them anymore. That and Lake O anyway.
