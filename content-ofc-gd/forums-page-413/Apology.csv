692012,Snidley,2012-05-01 21:23:00,620,"I had a smokin', drinkin', gamblin' father in law, a great guy, who told me that leaping to conclusions was the only exercise he got   . The booze and cigs got him unfortunately and he died at 55, of throat cancer (but not before I made some money with him on NFL games)."

691833,mikeseb,2012-05-01 13:02:00,201,"I wanna apologize to fishhero and anyone else that i had offended yesterday. I was 100% out of line with what I said and defiantly should have just simply reminded him about the OOS ""pic rule"" instead of being an  about this whole situation.  I never try to be a tough guy but sometimes my emotions get the better of me (especially when it comes to fishin).  I have come to a realization that all of us on this amazing forum share a passion for one of our countries greatest past-times, and based of that alone we should all get along.    Once again i sincerely apologize to you FISHHERO, you did not deserve that at all.  Mike"
