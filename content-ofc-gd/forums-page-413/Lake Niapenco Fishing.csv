692081,Canitalian,2012-05-02 00:40:00,75,I hear they're open for Pike C & R as of May 1st. Anyone else know about this?
692086,pics,2012-05-02 01:24:00,1268,Pike opens the same time there as anywhere else.....
692098,Canitalian,2012-05-02 02:26:00,75,"I thought,though that Pike opened with Walleye on Sat. May 12 ?"

692124,pics,2012-05-02 04:36:00,1268,May 12 is when they both open....
692177,Fish Farmer,2012-05-02 13:52:00,2234,Can't wait for the derby.
692364,Canitalian,2012-05-02 22:57:00,75,Same here. ?
692368,Christopheraaron,2012-05-02 23:12:00,3525," x2, maybe not, just found this http://www.viewmag.com/13563-FISH+CONTAMINATED+AT+LAKE+NIAPENCO.htm"
692375,Canitalian,2012-05-02 23:42:00,75,I never planned on eating any of the fish anyway. Perfer more just to catch and release. ????
692377,Christopheraaron,2012-05-02 23:46:00,3525,"I wouldn't be eating any either, but imagine how that's effecting the health of the eco-system, no point in fishing if there aren't any fish! Also, now I'm not sure what to do because the rice lake festival is that weekend as well."
692402,pics,2012-05-03 01:03:00,1268,The lake is absolutely full of fish but until we find out more about the contamination and its effects on human health I would recommend catch and release. In the future more structure will be added to enhance the fishing further.
692416,vinnimon,2012-05-03 01:50:00,2593,hopefully I can make it out to the derby.
692422,Christopheraaron,2012-05-03 02:10:00,3525,In that case x2 confirmed!
