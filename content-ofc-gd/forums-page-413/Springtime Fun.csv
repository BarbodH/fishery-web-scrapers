691688,danbouck,2012-04-30 23:44:00,4380,"I haven't really had anything to write about for a while. This past winter fishing for me was nonexistent, even this spring I have rarely made it out. The few trips out have been fun as usual with family and some good friends.  The first trip of the year was with SRT8 and The Urban Fisherman. We headed to Dunnville to search for some cats. It was a miserable day and I froze my ass off    We didn't get a nibble but shared stories and laughed all day which is just as fun. Before we left town we had to at least hook into one cat each so we made a stop.          The next trip was a short perch trip with my 3 year old Jamie. I knew that rain was on it's way so I hurried out to a spot to get into some quick fish.    Jamie, as usual had a fish on before I was even ready.    We were only there a few minutes before the rain started so we headed in. I was happy because the first fish of the year was in the boat.  This past weekend we finally got down to the cottage for the weekend. To say that I missed it is an understatement. The dogs were happy to be back too.    Saturday was the day of the perch derby in Long Point. I took my 6 year old Jacob out and he destroyed me    I couldn't catch a keeper for the life of me, Jacob on the other hand was just pulling them in non-stop. It was a tough day out there and cold out but Jacob managed to get 5th place in the derby (not in a kids division). Jimmy Riggin set him up with some new gear and lures  He was one happy kid and I was one proud father!    Now as some of you may know, I decided to start running at the beginning of March. Not only to lose weight but to feel good in general and have more active fun with the kids. I set a goal of running 5k by the end of May. I didn't anticipate that my boss would start running as well and set a goal of 5k by the end of April. I am not one to be outdone so I started running hard and often. The pain went away and it became enjoyable. Shortly after we set a new goal of 10k by the end of April   Shortly after that he got an injury and had to stop. I got a couple 10k runs in and even a 15k but they were slow and painful.  I woke up Sunday morning and decided that I have to go for it. It was a perfect day and there is nothing like running down an empty beach.        Next up is the 5k in the Toronto Marathon next weekend, the day after a pike tournament  So today I finally had a chance to chase some trout. We made the long drive to my favourite stop and had only 30 minutes to fish before it started pouring. We ended up catching a few and Jamie was having a ton of fun.        Can't wait for the summer!   Dan"

691698,Christopheraaron,2012-04-30 23:59:00,3525,Are you sure that's ontario? I never seen mountains like that around here. Looks great!
691701,Dutchy,2012-05-01 00:06:00,416,can't fool me dan. Those mountains are near Kitchener. Nice try though  :whistling:
691704,danbouck,2012-05-01 00:08:00,4380, Thanks Merc    There is a picture on this board of me fishing with that one      It's quite a hike
691706,danbouck,2012-05-01 00:09:00,4380, closer to London
691712,asdve23rveavwa,2012-05-01 00:17:00,2690,Great stuff buddy!!  You truly are a great dad  We'll be fishing together in less than three weeks.
691727,Rod Caster,2012-05-01 00:44:00,5784,Congrats to Jamie on 5th place! I'm quite a bit lighter than you and there isn't a chance in hell I'd last for 5k let alone double digits. I barely managed to lose a hockey tournament this weekend haha.You picked the perfect ground to run on..well done!
691735,Nipfisher,2012-05-01 01:05:00,2449,Looks like the Cambrian shield to me. Great fishing with the young guy.
691738,Twocoda,2012-05-01 01:11:00,4130,Great report Dan...i just bought some seeds to grow my own mountains too....hope to heck mine turn out as good as yours...  How often did you water them?
691746,bigugli,2012-05-01 01:28:00,6138,"You never heard of the ""Blue"" Mountains?"
691749,FisherJuli,2012-05-01 01:30:00,125,"Great pics, Dan... But we can put that warm up to the test with the boys in a week and a half. I must say that your son looks pleased in the mountains with his dad-- we sure have gotta learn that shortcut!! Nice adventures so far this spring, Dan!"
691752,Christopheraaron,2012-05-01 01:35:00,3525,
691753,Rod Caster,2012-05-01 01:37:00,5784,    you are 1% wiser now.
691756,Christopheraaron,2012-05-01 01:40:00,3525, So now I'm 101%  smarter than you!
691817,Rod Caster,2012-05-01 12:17:00,5784," Hahaha. Meet me at the base of the London, Ont mountain range and we'll settle this like men."
691859,Harrison,2012-05-01 13:52:00,2202," Awesome Dan!!  Congrats on this PB, keep at it, there will be a lot more PB's to come if you keep this up!"
691919,danbouck,2012-05-01 16:55:00,4380," haha, The beach is actually worse to run on than most other surfaces. It goes from soft sinking sand to unlevel hard sand often and you can't get use to it.   Thanks Nip   Two gallons per hour   Thanks Juli, 2.5 more weeks!   Thanks Phil, My ultimate goal for this year is a half marathon in September"
691926,fishnsled,2012-05-01 17:11:00,3520,Great report Dan and congrats to Jamie on 5th place! Congrats to you as well on your running accomplishments!! Well done sir!!
691954,John,2012-05-01 18:05:00,2956, Hope that you Dan and the girls have a great time.........sorry I couldn't be there.
692065,solopaddler,2012-05-01 23:52:00,8605,"Awesome Dan, very inspiring! It wasn't that long ago I was an avid runner. Was regularly pulling off a sub 38 min 10K  then I stopped, let everything slide, lost all my latent fitness and I'm shadow of the man I used to be LOL!  Been thinking of starting again. I've been doing 4K off and on with the dog since Feb pretty easily so I'm feeling fairly good about it.  Keep it up bud, it will change your life."
