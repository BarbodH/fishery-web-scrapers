690739,Leecher,2012-04-27 23:00:00,7832,"Hey everyone,  hope you guys and gals are good?  Talk about a waiting game fishing wise   April 27th 2012 couldn't come soon enough for me     was anxiously waiting since late February   because our hard water season up here was cut short due to unsafe ice  Plans back then was already in the works  Had a couple of local lakes I needed to target for trout opener and today was the day  Was hoping to get into a Grand Slam this year consisting of catching a rainbow, a laker and a speck but instead got into OOS species at first  and then a few specks  Mother Nature, made it hard to achieve this goal  and proved once again that no one can mess with her     It was dead freezing out there    with temps of -2C, a North Westerly gusting 30 - 40 Km/h, wind chill UNKNOWN  somewhere around -12C maybe more  Ask my digits... they are stiff and sore from the abuse they took today casting hardware  Left home late... not wanted... but... was supposed to leave at 6h00am and instead left at 6h30am   got to the first lake around 8h15am... no one in sight    Got the rods out and tied a Black Fury #2 dressed to start with...  Whitespinnerbait... get ready... you're going to love this  First cast and on the retrieve, get a solid hit    At this point I'm thinking rainbow.... fought this fish for a good minute until it surface... not OOS largie   Back she goes  Got into a few more and decided at this point to tie a Black Fury #5 dressed to see if the rainbows would come out to play.... not OOS pike.  Then I hear the sound of an oncoming vehicule    They backed out to the boat launch and at this point decided to head to the other lake I had plan to target    So I pack up and leave.  Once at the new destination, get the rod out that was already prepped with the Black Fury #5 and make my first cast... to my surprise, a lovely speck decide to have the offering for a lunch    and land my first speck of the season WOO WHOO  Here's what she had inside her gullet    Talk about an hungry fish eh    Then I tried a few more time casting but the guides on the rod just got ice buildup so I switch to a slip bobber type rig with a piece of worm and got a couple more   Went 3 for 6, the last one was 12 1/4"" long, a good start for Team 9 on the NGL category    After that, it went dead and I decided to call it a day... left and got home around 4h20pm Hope you enjoy the read!!! Tight lines TJunkie"
690744,Rod Caster,2012-04-27 23:21:00,5784,"NICE  Great start to the season. I'll have to catch a 13"" NGL this weekend to keep you guys back! haha"
690748,misfish,2012-04-27 23:28:00,29133,"Nice, long day my friend.Did you find any wild garlic?Im still looking. When I think I found some and pull up,I see roots,  I,m all set up with my go to spinner.Picked up this sweet rod off of Daniel,and on the same morning, bought this California tackle reel at the Hamilton swap.     I,ll be looking to put team 1,in the 1 spot,for the  NGL category . "
690752,kerr,2012-04-27 23:39:00,77,4:20 seems like the perfect time to get home there bud
690755,Whitespinnerbait,2012-04-27 23:48:00,2038,"Nice trout there Junkie, But 24/7 and Cprince hit Paydirt......going 28 for 40, all in the 2 pound range  :worthy:  :worthy:  :worthy:  :worthy:"
690756,Joeytier,2012-04-27 23:54:00,3990,World's greatest sport fish.    Nice shootin!
690766,asdve23rveavwa,2012-04-28 00:19:00,2690,"Way to go Jacques. Specks were the fish of choice on openers for my dad and I for years as I grew up.  We trudged along many paths and through alot of bush looking for those beauties! Heading out tomorrow for our opener with Juli's dad and brother for, hopefully, some small lake rainbows and/or browns."
690771,Twocoda,2012-04-28 00:37:00,4130,very nice shootin...the bounty was well worth effort
690807,carll2,2012-04-28 02:00:00,443,"nice specs buddy!! when are you coming down this way(grenville) for some private speckled lakes i know?  we went 12 for 17 today all between 8-14 inch, it was a slow roll bite"
690861,Leecher,2012-04-28 11:53:00,7832, Thanks Chad!!!  lol... Good luck this weekend!   Thanks Brian!!!  I know where to find wild leeks up here but we are not allowed to pick them... Parc de la Gatineau is where there is tones of them... against the law to do so    Good luck with the NGL category!   Just before rush hour   Thanks Paul!!!  COOL!!! they hit the mother load eh   You got that right Joey!!! Thanks mon chum!   Thanks Frankie!!!  Good luck with your opener   Thanks Dave!!!  It sure was   Thanks Carl!!!  12 for 17... You guys did great    Let's make it happen   Would be honoured to go fishing with you in your neck of the woods
690862,Stoty,2012-04-28 11:56:00,2910,LMAO!
690894,Christopheraaron,2012-04-28 15:15:00,3525,"Nice fish there! I tried my hand at some trout fishing this morning, I'm fairly sure that I got a good bite but I'm not sure, no action after that so now I'm headed for perchville."
690915,carll2,2012-04-28 17:23:00,443,"any time man i leave may 10th for my guiding season up north so let me know!!! and btw i was under the impression for the wild garlic its a limit of 50 plants per person per year, and no selling allowed?"
690918,carll2,2012-04-28 17:33:00,443,"yep jacque, i just checked on the mnrf website and wild garlic collecting IS legal as long as you dont go over your 50 bulb limit, selling them is a big no no .... great because i went and got my 50 yesterday and they were DELICIOUS!!!"
690924,bushart,2012-04-28 17:54:00,2628,Beauty fish
690928,limeyangler,2012-04-28 18:02:00,5204,Great (if not a little chilly)opener mon ami!  Whats with the skinny fish?  anyhoo....enjoy supper.
691001,Leecher,2012-04-28 22:36:00,7832," Thanks RFH!!!  Sometimes they do nibble at the offering and other times, you will definitely know they are hungry  Thing is to keep at it    Good luck in perchville!!!   I will most definitely let you know!  Yes Carl, the 50 bulb limit is what is currently the law and no selling   Collecting is legal on crown or private land but in the Gatineau Hills it's illegal to harvest... Signs are posted everywhere and it's a shame cause I knew a great spot to go to and not that far... Once arrived at the spot you can see the plants as far as the eye can see   Thanks Terrence!!!   Thanks Simon!!!  Actually, for better words, was bone chilling out there yesterday  I froze my bejesus standing on shore and waiting for the byte    my fault    didn't have long johns on   Thank god I had a deluxe clam shelter that was gas powered and had a great heater  As for the skinny fish, that was the first fish I had put in the cooler and got squished when I put the other 2 on top of it  Supper was awesome thanks"
691008,mercman,2012-04-28 23:16:00,7054,"Awesome day Jacques.Nice specks. Never got into trout fishing,not saying i wouldnt try it someday, just not right now"
691011,Leecher,2012-04-28 23:25:00,7832," Thanks Paul!!!  If you ever decide to take it up and come up this way, give me a hauler.... would be my pleasure to share some shoreline time with you"
691020,Fishing 24/7,2012-04-29 00:11:00,709,DUDE! paul just told me that you switch your user name!  WHAT THE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  :worthy:  nice trout buddayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
691033,Leecher,2012-04-29 00:41:00,7832, Thanks Kev!!!  Yeah I switch name since I've rediscovered my love for trout and truly only targeted them this past year    figured it was proper and logical to me don't you think?  You guys sure got into some brutes   I'm pretty sure we weren't to far from each other yesterday
691064,carll2,2012-04-29 01:39:00,443,well then we can make it a speck/garlic day and maybe even innitiate mercman into speck fishing
691066,Leecher,2012-04-29 01:45:00,7832," Sounds like a plan Carl   Let's get a G2G for Grenville with Paul, you and I  The specks don't stand a chance   and the garlic.... well the more the marrier  Heck we should get Roy too   That would be the icing on the cake   What do you say Paul & Roy... ready for a Grenville G2G???"
691071,carll2,2012-04-29 02:06:00,443,im down for it... im free anytime during the week or next weekend
691079,Leecher,2012-04-29 02:19:00,7832," Carl,  I'll send a group PM and see what the consensus is... I'm free pretty much every weekend"
