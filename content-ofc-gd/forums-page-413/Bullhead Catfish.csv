692112,Beans,2012-05-02 02:52:00,3339,"MMMmmm...spring bullheads...My granddad and I used to catch them using a ""bob"" (about twenty dew worms sown on a strong thread stringer then tied into a ball...no hooks)...we used a four foot stick with about the same amount of heavy green cord attached and tied the ball of worms to that...We would anchor in about three feet of water at dusk and when you felt a bite you just lifted the catfish into the boat...seems they won't let go until they touch sumpin'...Dumped them in our ""live box"" near shore and took out a dozen or so anytime we felt like having fish for dinner..."
692142,mike rousseau,2012-05-02 11:54:00,4661, We had long Bamboo poles...like 20 footers... I remember that line too...black or green heavy braid line... And hand carved red and white bobbers shaped like a fish... With the kerosene lantern hissing behind us on the dock...
692151,Rod Caster,2012-05-02 12:19:00,5784,"Good stuff Mike. I'll shadow Beans' statement of ""Mmmmmm"". We call em' ""barbottes""."
692162,mike rousseau,2012-05-02 13:10:00,4661,  a lot of french people around here call them that too...
692166,Beans,2012-05-02 13:24:00,3339, We used the bamboo poles when fishing from shore or from the nearby bridge...  The green line came in a paper wrapper from the local hardware store...cost a quarter I think...back in the 40's...   
692232,Christopheraaron,2012-05-02 17:07:00,3525,"Will be out this Saturday for suckers with locnar, after that I know of a good place to pound the bullheads all day!"
692246,aplumma,2012-05-02 18:15:00,6896,It's funny about regions around here they are called mudcats and most consider them to be even below carp on the eating scale. Now Chanel cats and blue cats will hit just about anyone's table here for food.   Art
692311,snowdown,2012-05-02 20:12:00,24,i caught them a lot in lock 38 a few years back.
692428,Beans,2012-05-03 02:23:00,3339," I heard that restaurants in some states have mudcats on the menu as ""mountain trout""...   "
692487,aplumma,2012-05-03 11:34:00,6896," I haven't come across that in the areas I have been but you can bet I wouldn't order any food with the word mountain in it since my order of  ""Mountain Oysters"" and found out what they really were.   Art"
