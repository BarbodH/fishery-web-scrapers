Also, any suggestions for apps that are useful to an angler/outdoorsman???  I have wrote down some of the suggestions from a previous thread  Thanks for any advice!"

687344,manitoubass2,2012-04-17 04:52:00,11391,"Thanks Drifter, I already had that link but it wasn't showing the right apps.  Turns out, in small print in the news section, that as of april 11 the marine apps are not available, they are under maintenance"
687475,Cosmos,2012-04-17 15:50:00,588,  Does it say when this app will be availalbe again? Thanks
687526,manitoubass2,2012-04-17 17:57:00,11391," Yeah, one would think that would make sense    The end of April is when it says it will be available again, with upgrades  I guess I'll be left waiting anxiously until it's available again"
687531,Cosmos,2012-04-17 18:05:00,588," Me too,  Actually i was curious what's going on with this app, thanks to you now i do know."
687722,Jer_H,2012-04-18 00:05:00,25,My GPS app is actually pretty bang on with my Garmin.  Gotta love iPhones
687935,muskeybugged,2012-04-18 16:22:00,282," My app map sucks, missing a small island which has a memorial cross for some unlucky fella. I guess he had the app too.  I'm on the horn with navionics to see whats up, they seem to be good at responding quickly."
689916,Cosmos,2012-04-24 21:39:00,588,App is available again
689920,limeyangler,2012-04-24 21:56:00,5204,and i got a stupid Blackberry for my birthday. What a piece of poo...does not seem to support any mainstream apps.
690009,ohhenrygsr,2012-04-25 03:51:00,947,Navionics is alive and kicking I just got another update  yesterday.
690010,manitoubass2,2012-04-25 04:26:00,11391,"I just downloaded it for no reason,  I only have iphone 3g.  My god I'm not tech savy at all, says right there my phone wont support it.  Good waste of a half case of beer"
690078,The Urban Fisherman,2012-04-25 15:34:00,2050,Has anybody tried using it on their Ipad?
690091,blaque,2012-04-25 16:18:00,2419,"Speaking of using your iphone out on the water, in the rain, etc etc.......has anyone found a good waterproof case for when the innevitable happens. Waterproof and flaoting would be an even better find??"
690099,DRIFTER_016,2012-04-25 16:41:00,10439,  Ask and ye shall receive. Not floating though. You could always clip a float on.  http://www.lifeproof.com/
691484,blaque,2012-04-30 17:48:00,2419, This looks great........not a thrilling pricetag though.  Id be interested if it had a clip on location to put a floaty on
691486,DRIFTER_016,2012-04-30 17:55:00,10439,"  I don't know, $78 to save you from bricking a $700 phone seems cheap to me. Try contacting them and see if there is a tethering spot on the case."
691493,blaque,2012-04-30 18:16:00,2419," well, ive got a $50 deductible for the first time i toss her in the drink lol  But again, good find and ill definitely look into it"
691526,Realsteel19,2012-04-30 19:03:00,19,Cant wait to get my i phone for the apps
691741,DRIFTER_016,2012-05-01 01:14:00,10439,  Check out this one. My buddy down south just got one to check out and he say it's pretty good. And it has a strap too.  Dri Suit Technologies   My buddy has posted his initial review on his web site.  Read it and watch the video HERE
691984,blaque,2012-05-01 19:49:00,2419, Thanks again drifter.....looks good
