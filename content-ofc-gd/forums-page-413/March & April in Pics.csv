692430,laszlo,2012-05-03 02:32:00,487,Enjoy...  I found this guy in the first week of March. Strange.      The week before closer.    3 weeks ago the amount of Steelhead in this trib was mind blowing.      Drop back Steel looking as Chrome and Clean as ever.    Carp count too right?    This one put my Raven IM8 to the test.    Another critter.    Over and out. Laz
