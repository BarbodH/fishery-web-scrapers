They'very only had it a short time and will only be my second opener on it. Any suggestions?? I have 1 or 2 potential spots but seems like everyone knows them. The place is so shallow and weedy was hoping for some guidance lol. If anyone is going to be up that way stop by, its the third cottage from the launch. thanks in advance."
