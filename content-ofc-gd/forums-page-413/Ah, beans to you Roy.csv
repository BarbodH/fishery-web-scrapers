691415,Billy Bob,2012-04-30 14:20:00,5865, Frank.....you need to set the bar a little higher....
691433,asdve23rveavwa,2012-04-30 15:01:00,2690,  LOL!  As for setting the bar higher (or maybe just add to the bucket list) check out Fishing 24/7's post with the brookies.  Juli's dad and I were talking about that during our trout opener on Saturday.  A dream for both of us!  Now back to our regulary scheduled bean talk
691442,misfish,2012-04-30 15:41:00,29133, I just have kippered and smoked herring and crackers in my drawer. They just love the smell at lunch time here.  Thanks for the recipes.
691445,Roy,2012-04-30 16:03:00,13728,I have a dried cod on the dash of the truck.
691460,Fang,2012-04-30 16:47:00,1330,OK Roy wins!!!!!!!
691483,blaque,2012-04-30 17:45:00,2419,"Member these? Wouldnt go too well on the side with walleye or perch, as they are actually candy coated peanuts lol  "
691485,misfish,2012-04-30 17:52:00,29133,  Not any more.

691820,Fish Farmer,2012-05-01 12:28:00,2234,"X10. Can't beat homemade beans, Johnny cake, Biscuits, and molasses. For canned I'll take Heinz Maple style beans."
691916,Snowball,2012-05-01 16:47:00,167,"I decided that I should add a few pictures of my homemade beans so I whipped up a batch last night.  Slow cooker ready to roll   Beans prior to cooking. Used homemade smoked bacon in place of store bought.   Beans after 13 hours cooking.   Yummy......lunch!   Note: For some reason the bean mixture was quite dry this morning but a 1/2 cup of water cured that. These beans do not bark back at you, if you get my drift.  Enjoy Snowball"
692010,bigugli,2012-05-01 21:19:00,6138,Beans have goota bark back
692016,misfish,2012-05-01 21:48:00,29133,"Thats mighty fine look,n vitals.  Thanks."

691242,Gerritt,2012-04-29 21:17:00,6129,Gotta love Bush Beans!!!!!!! I wish it was easier to find them here in Canada... not to many places carry them.   Edit to add: Those ribs look awesome!! (in the smoker? or the boil and BBQ method)  G
691244,misfish,2012-04-29 21:19:00,29133," Their every where G. Zhers,walmart,Metro.  Just wished they had dem big cans."
691246,Gerritt,2012-04-29 21:20:00,6129,Recently they have em here... I used to have to go to the states to buy em.... and your right when you do find em here... small cans only and not all the varieties...
691248,misfish,2012-04-29 21:24:00,29133," Dry rub,put in the fridge for 12 hours,then indirect heat at 275 on the BBQ for 4 hrs. Mop of home made sauce,on the hot grill for 3-4 minutes each side to glaze.  TY."
691249,lew,2012-04-29 21:25:00,12766,I buy the Bush beans in Foodland in Lakefield but when I was there last week they were outta stock. I went and enquired and was told their supplier no longer carries them but they were searching around for another supplier.  With my wife cruising somewhere on the Pacific Ocean I'm eating alot of beans and Heinz doesn't compare to Bush.
691251,Billy Bob,2012-04-29 21:27:00,5865,"Brian, you need to try the ""Country Style"" Bush Beans....and they have about 4-6 more varieties to choose from."
691253,misfish,2012-04-29 21:29:00,29133, Yes I know BB.  We have limited varieties here. Im  a mallasoss guy.
691254,Gerritt,2012-04-29 21:32:00,6129,I love the Grillin' Beans Steakhouse flavour.... Mmmmmmm!

691264,misfish,2012-04-29 21:58:00,29133, Thought you would like that Paul.  I eat dem cold. That can was in the fridge since yesterday.
691265,Roy,2012-04-29 22:04:00,13728,Buy a bag of beans and make your own. They're much better.
691267,misfish,2012-04-29 22:07:00,29133," I leave that to me mudder me brudder,who learned from her mudder. Dem the best.  Bush will do for now.LOL"

691269,Joeytier,2012-04-29 22:12:00,3990,Bush Beans!  My favourite on-ice snack.

691278,Billy Bob,2012-04-29 23:04:00,5865, Looks GOOD....but those latex gloves can be dangerous around hot items like that pot....
691292,Fisherman,2012-04-29 23:54:00,7201," I think I'll eat the latex gloves.  I don't know what was more in quantity, the variety of sugar based products or beans."
691297,ketchenany,2012-04-30 00:17:00,3229," Shame on you Lew, a fireman eating out of a can! I chat York Region's finest and when they shop they seem to avoid canned goods! the best I've had with them; one asked what peanut butter should I buy - me, the one with the peanut on top - they broke up. ( my advertising training) Venison in the Yard sound good."
691313,bigugli,2012-04-30 00:49:00,6138,"No better combination than beans, meat and beer.  Bush are no substitute for homemade, but they are pretty good. Just remember, no more than 2 bean eaters should be in the room at any given time.  "
691318,Fang,2012-04-30 01:00:00,1330,Heck Brian I have several cans in the overhang cupboard at my desk. Nothing like eating them right out of the can while at work!!!!

Worcestershire sauce 1 Tbsp. chili powder  salt and pepper to taste  Sauté onions and garlic in heavy dutch oven, add everything else and place the dutch oven in a smoker with lid off for at least 2 hours at 200F. You can also go indirect on a gas grill using a smoke box.  If they start to dry out add a bit of beer or water to keep them liquid. If using pork hocks remove and debone when cooked and add the meat back into the beans.  If you're feeding women, children, or Liberals you can use only half of the hot peppers.  Dan"
