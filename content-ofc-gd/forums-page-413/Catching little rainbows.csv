692179,tbaltovski,2012-05-02 14:00:00,38,I was fishing the creek behind my school where there are big rainbow trout but I kept catching the small ones.  Am I doing any harm to the fish by catching them? I use a barb-less hook.
692183,BillM,2012-05-02 14:06:00,17367,"Those are steelhead smolts...  You really don't wanna be putting hooks into them, but good job at making sure you're barbless.   If you are getting smolt after smolt, definitely move spots."
692184,chuckymcd,2012-05-02 14:07:00,144,you usually have to fish out all the small ones before you get to the big guys.  Oh and welcome to the board!
692206,tbaltovski,2012-05-02 15:40:00,38,Thanks guys.  I try to get my bait the drift to the bigger fish but the little buggers hit it first.  I did move after trying for a bit.   Is there any way to get the bigger ones to bite in the situation?
692208,BillM,2012-05-02 15:48:00,17367,"Try tossing a big spinner through the pool or even a stick bait.  Usually you'll get the bigger, aggressive fish first."
692211,tbaltovski,2012-05-02 15:57:00,38,Anything on a cetrepin? Big jig?
692215,BillM,2012-05-02 16:15:00,17367,"Big jig, big nightcrawler, etc. (You can also run hardbaits under a float as well)"
692233,tbaltovski,2012-05-02 17:12:00,38,"Thanks Bill, I will try tomorrow morning or evening after class.  I'm new to float fishing. When using a jig in a 1-2 foot pool with clear water, do I make near the bottom or in the middle?   Will the fish bite the big bait out of hunger, curiosity or rage?"
