691842,mirogak,2012-05-01 13:16:00,387, Sounds like GoPro action ... Good luck.
691852,BillM,2012-05-01 13:37:00,17367," Nah, my Canon 60D and some really nice glass a buddy is letting me borrow    This water is going to be very tea stained, not ideal for any underwater action."
691858,SirCranksalot,2012-05-01 13:49:00,3291,   So how was your trip? Trout pix?
692288,mirogak,2012-05-02 19:38:00,387,"  Hey Knuguy,  Got to AP at 11:30pm Friday night and what was interesting is as I was driving up, the temp was dropping by a degree every 20minutes of driving...  Anyhow, very cool Friday night/Sat morning (-10 or -11) and the following day hit a brookie lake with a 1 hr portage with a (novice) buddy of mine.  Within 10 paddles I saw splashes near the shore but long story short, my buddy couldn't position the canoe properly, didn't know the JStroke, banging the paddle against the canoe, and worst of all he was trying to work the shoreline too.  Spooked any fish that were there.  Came back to the same spot the next day but it was too sunny and windy - no action.  That same day then decided to hit the Oxtongue river but it was pretty high, no chance of wading it.  Got disappointed and came back a day early than I wanted to.  But came back with experience and some lessons learned.  Either go alone or go with someone who knows what they are doing.  I will be hitting AP one more time this spring and hope to share some trout pix with you all then.  This is all I got for pix:   Haha - this is that Friday night/Sat morning I was talking about.  I had to abort the tent and get to the car but didn't help.  Froze my #$ off.  Woke up every 2 hours to take a leak ... damn.       "
692293,solopaddler,2012-05-02 19:45:00,8605,"Sorry it didn't go as planned Miro.  Small tip: When it's that cold outside consider using some kind of ""truckers bottle"" in the tent rather than crawling out into that brutal cold.  I have a small widemouth nalgene that I use for just such emergencies. (note the use of the word ""widemouth""  ). Even a large zip lock works great.  Too bad about your luck, I'm sure you'll do better next time."
692294,mirogak,2012-05-02 19:46:00,387," As I sit here in office and going over this post I just left, a thought hit me ... ""I never worked this hard even to get girls when I was younger"" ... strange isn't it."
692298,mirogak,2012-05-02 19:51:00,387," Lol @ widemouth ... hahahah  Okay thanks for the tip - I will definitely keep that in mind.  Like I said, came away with experience. Miro"
692299,solopaddler,2012-05-02 19:52:00,8605, Personally I didn't pursue girls at all when I was younger. Was always too busy fishing or paddling.  For me at least females just got in the way of what I really wanted to do.  I had the occasional girl pursue me...but I put zero effort into it until I reached the age of 32.
692312,jedimaster,2012-05-02 20:13:00,3472, Umm is that how you got the solopaddler name? jk...
692313,solopaddler,2012-05-02 20:18:00,8605,"  All jokes aside, yes. I more or less spent the ages of 19-32 paddling solo all over NW Ontario.  I worked nothing but crappy jobs just long enough to finance my next expedition. Many years I was in the bush from May 'till September..."
692322,Fishing yoda,2012-05-02 20:35:00,29,"Nice to hear about the park fisheriy doing so well, I hope one day myself in the near future to head up there for opening weekdn for some gorgeous spring brooks and lakers,   does anyone go west of temagami?"
692323,jedimaster,2012-05-02 20:43:00,3472,I'll be up for the opening to my season this weekend. the weather looks perfect for a Speck fest....Hopefully I'll have some pictures to bring back.
692335,SirCranksalot,2012-05-02 21:31:00,3291, At that age and with all that time in the bush I'm surprised that even a moose would start to look good!   
692340,solopaddler,2012-05-02 21:52:00,8605,"  It's funny you say that Harold. I remember times when oddly shaped pieces of driftwood were strangely attractive LOL!   I remember one time I was on the Albany River about to ascend the Attwood River when I ran into a group of natives from Fort Hope fishing out of 3 Lund boats.  In one of the boats was the chief of Fort Hope and his wife.  What I found ironically funny, the chief was aghast when I told him I was on day 47 of a 65 day solo trip. ""I'd never do something like that, you're crazy!""  They were quite gracious though, offering to share there food with me as they were about to cook up some pork chops for dinner.  I politely declined but said if they happened to have a 19 year old blonde nympho in the bottom of their boat I'd take one.  Well I guess I tickled their funny bones. I set up camp about a km away and for the next 11/2 hours they'd spontaneously burst into hysterical laughter about every 15 minutes.  In all seriousness there were very very few times on any of those lengthy solo expeditions where I actually felt lonely.  I've felt much more alone in the city surrounded by mass humanity."
692341,mirogak,2012-05-02 21:54:00,387,Pretty cool.
674163,solopaddler,2012-03-08 11:52:00,8605,  I paddled it once years and years ago but my memory of it is vague beyond the good brook trout fishing.  We'll be flying into an outpost camp on Dusey lake and fishing the river upstream and down. The outfitter recently cut trails around rapids/falls and cached squareback canoes to open up miles of new water.  Which book talks about the Dusey being haunted? I'd love to read it.
674178,SirCranksalot,2012-03-08 13:21:00,3291,"Well, I have a kevlar canoe and all the gear(Heck, I have several canoes)I, so if anyone is looking for a partner PM me."
674204,chris.brock,2012-03-08 14:54:00,4053,"Berger and Terry ""Canoe Atlas of the Little North"", it's pricey but an awesome reference book (I keep it in the bathroom so I can skim through it while I have some time sitting there) they don't say much more than that about the haunted stuff looks like 7 Lakes Outposts, I bet there isn't alot of parties going in there I'll say it again, you're a lucky guy, looking forward to the report on that one"
674216,solopaddler,2012-03-08 15:13:00,8605,"  Cool thanks man, I'll give Chapters a call and see if they have it.  It is 7 Lakes. The owner Brad recently aquired the Dusey camp and yeah it hasn't been fished much at all in recent years. Should definitely be interesting."
674222,mirogak,2012-03-08 15:20:00,387, Ok I must admit.  I have never been to AP in spring (been only in summer and fall).  What makes the Spring time so great?
674225,BillM,2012-03-08 15:40:00,17367, Brookies in 6ft of water or less.
674233,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2012-03-08 16:07:00,0, and a willingness to smash small spinners with the ferocity of a hungry bass.
674248,4x4bassin,2012-03-08 17:04:00,1025,"I don't know about you guys but I start planning and thinking about my spring trip as soon as the snow flies the previous year so its been a long winter thinking about it and anticipating the good times with friends and catching those shallow lakers ! As well as the sights , sounds and smells of spring in the bush are indescribable , you just have to experience it !"
674250,trevy727,2012-03-08 17:08:00,351,No bugs in the early spring. Hungry fish. Fall is great too. Right before closing.
674296,mirogak,2012-03-08 20:39:00,387, Really - OMG! like a bass.  Can't wait.
674299,BillM,2012-03-08 21:07:00,17367, You gotta find them first   Elusive little buggers at times!
674327,SirCranksalot,2012-03-08 23:35:00,3291,"And if you get there after a good hatch(Mayflies etc) you can forget about using bait or anything other than flies----with the early spring that seems to be on it's way, who knows what it'll be like on opening day."
677566,HarryBB,2012-03-19 17:55:00,13,"I'll be fishing the Dusey river north of Nakina for a week in early June, then in late August a 12 day float trip down the Sutton river to Hudsons Bay.     I'll be on the Sutton from Hawley Lk to HB 8/28-9/7.  Please leave some for my group."
677572,solopaddler,2012-03-19 18:12:00,8605,  We'll do our best to sting every single aggressive fish before you arrive.
677580,jedimaster,2012-03-19 18:40:00,3472,This is where I'll be for the speck opener in algonquin....  
677604,BillM,2012-03-19 19:41:00,17367, Sounds like a plan
677607,HarryBB,2012-03-19 19:47:00,13,"We'll do our best to sting every single aggressive fish before you arrive.    That's fine - you can have the low hanging ""aggressive"" fruit.  We're more into the challenge of pursuing those that are more difficult to obtain.  (Kind of like the Home Coming Queen I took to tthe prom.)  The tougher the pursuit the sweeter the meat."
677609,solopaddler,2012-03-19 19:52:00,8605,  Actually we're going to take them all.  We're travelling with a native Ojibway who will be systematically gill netting the entire river from Hawley lake to the bay.  You might as well cancel your trip now.
677611,HarryBB,2012-03-19 20:00:00,13,  I'm familiar with the concept.  I live an hour from Mille Lacs in MN.  Does the technique work as well on Trout as it does on Walleye?  In seriousness - this will be our group's 29th annual trip... starting with Albany River canoe trips before the road to Armstrong was paved and when Wabakimi was just the name of a lake and not a park.  I spend months drooling over these trips and Sutton is going to be special I'm certain.
677612,solopaddler,2012-03-19 20:06:00,8605,"  You sound like a kindred spirit Harry, I've paddled most of the rivers in N/W Ontario myself. Much like yourself this is a much anticipated trip for us.  For me it's literally been in the works since my uncle told me wild tales of huge brookies in the spring of 1972.  It's too bad our trips are slightly overlapping. Otherwise I'd have been happy to share my trip notes with you.  There's really not much info floating around on this route.  Cheers"
677614,HarryBB,2012-03-19 20:10:00,13, If it's on the net we've got it already - but you are correct - not much out there.  We're good at making it up as we go along though.   Just don't leave any chewing gum wrappers laying around for us to pick up!  Hopefully we won't ride up on your bumper and compare notes post trip.
677618,solopaddler,2012-03-19 20:16:00,8605,"  Well you'll be about 5 days behind us. It's not impossible especially since we're taking 12 days and are planning several layovers.  Honestly that was my greatest concern when I booked with Hearst Air. I have no desire to have a flotilla of canoes herding me down the river.   They supposedly schedule the parties far enough apart and assured me of that, but there's many variables and nothing is certain."
677628,HarryBB,2012-03-19 20:29:00,13, 5 days should be plenty.  We aren't going to be in a hurry even though we've only got 9 river days.  In fact - now that we have this conversation we can manage our time to avoid overlap - we can stay in touch as we get closer to the dates.  If you know then when you are laying over maybe we can plan accordingly and do the same.  Might not be completely spontaneous but better than a crowd.  We will be a group of 4 - and we can barely stand to be around each other so we avoid strangers when we can!  Melanie was pretty clear about how she times the groups.  One of our guys screwed up the dates originally and we tried to shift to a day later - but she wouldn't have it given the next group coming in behind us.
677629,HarryBB,2012-03-19 20:31:00,13,  PS:  With 5 days there might even be someone in between us....
677633,solopaddler,2012-03-19 20:36:00,8605,"  That's a good idea Harry, I'm an antisocial jerk too.  It's not going to be easy to predict though. It'll be entirely based on weather and the quality of the fishing.  I suspect with it being later in the season the greatest concentrations of trout will be in the upper half of the river so it's more likely we'll layover there.  My direct email address is solopad[email protected] if you'd like to touch base later this summer."
673722,mirogak,2012-03-07 01:51:00,387,"Even though this wasn't much of a winter in the GTA, I am slowly coming out of my hibernation and there is only one thing on my mind - April 28 at the Highlands.

673787,irishfield,2012-03-07 04:27:00,26272,"Keep in mind, there are other places (without the traffic or fees) that can give you more solitude than Algonquin as well as Brookies!"
673788,chris.brock,2012-03-07 04:32:00,4053,"true, but there is alot of tradition with the Algonquin opener"
673790,irishfield,2012-03-07 04:37:00,26272,"I'm fairly certain that with the lack of ice on Temagami this year you'll be able to do a late April paddle/power boat to Brookie land with numerous places to camp. Ice out is usually early May... but I don't think it will hold out this year. Was gonna go up again next week, but not with +10 temps most days.."
673809,solopaddler,2012-03-07 10:41:00,8605,"I'm tentatively planning a short trip to Algonquin in early May. It's a fantastic time to be in the bush, a true harbinger of spring and the first real test of winter weary muscles. Nothing like it I agree.  I've been neglecting my favourite fish for far too long anyway, so this will be the year of the brook trout for me.  I'll be fishing the Dusey river north of Nakina for a week in early June, then in late August a 12 day float trip down the Sutton river to Hudsons Bay."

673818,simonl,2012-03-07 12:25:00,28,"Living on the Barron Canyon Rd, opening wknd is always an anxiously awaited tradition after the winter (that and the Quebec opener!) Usually it is touch and go as to whether or not the ice will be out, but this yr it seems there will be no question. I am currently in Curacao and not back for a couple weeks, but the weather reports seem very warm at home and friends that I have been in touch with say that it has been mild as well. When we left in Feb mind you, it was very much winter on the east side of the park. I will be interested to get home and check it out for myself and of course start to get my speckled gear ready!"
