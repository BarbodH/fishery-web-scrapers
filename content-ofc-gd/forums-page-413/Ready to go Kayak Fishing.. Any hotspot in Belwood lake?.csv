690293,juan96,2012-04-26 12:45:00,23,"Hi  I have finished installing my GPS,Fish Finder and Rod as shown.  Anybody know hot spot for Pike and walleye in Belwood lake? I'll go there this Saturday.  Or other lake is Ok for pike and walleye in spring season around GTA area.   "
690294,Nipfisher,2012-04-26 13:03:00,2449,Great job on the install.
690295,NAW,2012-04-26 13:04:00,4022,"Are Pike and Walleye open on Belwood Lake.  You might want to check the before targeting them  Sharp looking install!  Interesting location for the rod holder.  It looks like you will have limited range of motion for the rod when trolling, cuz it will hit the fish finder if at a 45Â° agle."
690296,mikeseb,2012-04-26 13:06:00,201,"PIKE AND WALLEYE ARE OUT OF SEASON RIGHT NOW!  AND WILL  BE THIS SATURDAY!  before you bought your fancy fish finder and gps, you should have looked at the fishing regs that were most likely available for free wherever you bought your kayak and fishfinder,  like the rest of us and you would see pike and walleye dont open until mid may.  You wouldnt want to get out on the lake and have the mnr come take all your new stuff would you?  Edit: also not a good idea asking  for specific spots on lakes that are within an hour away from the GTA.  If there are any sweet spots on that lake, nobody is going to give them up"
690297,juan96,2012-04-26 13:13:00,23,"I always catch n release also never bring the fish so far. Even though if I catch and release, it still illegal?"
690298,NAW,2012-04-26 13:14:00,4022,"YES..  IT IS ILLIGAL TO TARGET OOS FISH.  OOS = OUT OF SEASON.  The MNR will take the fance new kayak away from you, and all of your gear!"
690301,mikeseb,2012-04-26 13:22:00,201, READ THE REGS !!!!
690322,bigbuck,2012-04-26 14:57:00,2449,"Read the regulations. You can't go fishing for fish that are out of season, don't even think about trying. The MNR will confiscate all of your gear and you DON'T GET IT BACK!. Be patient, fishing season approaches quickly."
690327,juan96,2012-04-26 15:07:00,23,Thanks all. I gave up my schedule but trout season will be open from this 4th Saturday on zone 17. I will try to catch trout. Thanks.
690332,Rod Caster,2012-04-26 15:40:00,5784," That's pretty much all I can target up north as well... dont' get me wrong, I love fishing for trout or all kinds, but this is typically my least active time of the year for fishing. Can't wait for walleye/pike...but of course I will wait"
690808,northernpike56,2012-04-28 02:02:00,717,"go pick up the regs, they're free... belwwod lake is zone 16. walleye and pike are OOS right now.  edit: and it is illigal to target any OOS fish regardless if you release them or not."
690813,lovetofish,2012-04-28 02:16:00,500,  Good thing for the information on this site!
690814,NAW,2012-04-28 02:20:00,4022,"Just think of the thousands of people who don't have a clue, that don't read this site, and fish OOS all the time.  Not even knowing they're in the wrong."
690816,lovetofish,2012-04-28 02:32:00,500,"I know some of those people!  They think because they only fish a few times of year, that the rules don't apply to them."
690819,waterwolf,2012-04-28 02:42:00,556,"but these are the worst,out of season for a reason.. spawning! the most vulnerable time for many species."
690821,NAW,2012-04-28 02:50:00,4022,That's what makes it so Brutal..  Some people just don't have a clue.
690825,northernpike56,2012-04-28 03:16:00,717,we need more CO's out there.  
690832,lovetofish,2012-04-28 04:11:00,500,Signs in popular fishing areas would help!
690838,Stoty,2012-04-28 04:55:00,2910, Agreed 10000%. But wait... that would mean the gov't would have to SPEND money....  Or reading a regs book...?   I can see it now.... the GRADUATED FISH LICENSE system!  Step 1 - Pass a written test on the opening/closing dates of each species in your area ($49) Step 2 - Pass a casting test (Another $49) Step 3 - Pass a setting hook and playing fish test ($49 + gov't fee for using a rod) Step 4 - Pass a landing/unhooking/fish test ($49) Step 5 - Pass a HOW TO HOLD A FISH IN A PICTURE test ($299 cause they charge you for a gov't issued camera) Step 6 - Pass a releasing fish test (on sale $29.99) Step 7 - wait a full year (or 8 mths if you attend classes) until you can get your full license
690847,Christopheraaron,2012-04-28 10:13:00,3525, For a one year license that expires at the end of the year!
690848,Stoty,2012-04-28 10:16:00,2910, That's in the fine print.... LMAO!
690923,mikeseb,2012-04-28 17:52:00,201,"I think that upon applying for a fishing licence, reading the entire regulation book should me mandatory.  Most people dont know the fishing seasons and fish OOS all the time."
691792,pics,2012-05-01 07:43:00,1268,Enough about regs...how the heck do you get into a kayak without getting wet??? The thought of one I like...thinking how I get into one...not so much! It has to be easier than a float tube though.....
