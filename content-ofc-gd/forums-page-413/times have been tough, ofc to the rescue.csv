692050,woodenboater,2012-05-01 23:18:00,2277,"x2 what TJ says, Dave.  I went through this a couple of years ago with my dad and it was relatively fast. I still think if I'd done a few things differently, he'd still be here but I tend to believe in fate so...  All your dad needs is to see you there with him and that'll give him tremendous support through these days. Be strong for him in spite of how much it hurts you to see him like this, and that will give him great comfort.  I wish the best for you and your family.   Freddy  ps-my neighbour and some friends are OP's and I know they'll move mountains to make sure your dad gets better."
692077,tb4me,2012-05-02 00:32:00,3295,Sorry to hear this Dave. Positive thoughts and prayers sent you way..
692078,Fisherman,2012-05-02 00:32:00,7201,"Wish you the best in your efforts, hope he gets better."
692193,fishing n autograph,2012-05-02 14:44:00,2540,"Dad is starting to feel better, his speech is still slow and so is his thought process and he's still very weak. The good news is that he raring to go home and several times the nurse found him out of his bed trying to get home!"
692219,ketchenany,2012-05-02 16:33:00,3229,Our best thoughts coming your way Dave. I went through it with my mom last year. Healthy all her life no problems at all. She started feeling a bit of pain and we got her to a hospital and she never came out!  Your dad will be fine as long they keep a close eye on him.  A
692321,HTHM,2012-05-02 20:33:00,4082,"That is an encouraging sign, Dave. You and yours are in our prayers."
692333,Big Cliff,2012-05-02 21:27:00,6899,Our thoughts and prayers are with you and yours! Glad to hear he is showing signs of improvement. Being at the hospital when it happened probably saved his life!
692359,Billy Bob,2012-05-02 22:41:00,5865,"Glad to hear you dad is doing a little better....you're a good son....  If at all possible, get him to Buffalo General Hospital in Buffalo, NY...they are the best around when it come to heart problems....I speak from experience....he is NOT that old....he has another 10-20 years to go...at least..."
692380,Carp,2012-05-02 23:52:00,1488,Hope he gets well soon. Best wishes.
691876,fishing n autograph,2012-05-01 14:33:00,2540,"Hey All,  Well I guess it's true what they say, life kicks you when your down. I blew out my shoulder 3 weeks ago and things were looking bad for me, lost my chance to play in a baseball tournament against many great teams from across north america.  So I got a text message from my dad last week. He had finally heard from the heart surgeon in London and after waiting over a year for much needed/life saving surgery he was scheduled to have it in September. A huge relief to him and my mom. Things were looking up.  The yesterday at about 2pm I get a frantic call from my mom saying that dad wasn't feeling well and he went to the family doctor. Dad's heart has been out of whack for 15 yrs, but its recently gotten really bad. So I picked him up and brought him home. He flat out refused to go to the hospital because he was tired of waiting 4-8 hrs to see the doctor who would just send him home.  So, after much coaxing I got him to the hospital. Thank god. He was so stubborn he refused to sit down. So he got himself a bottle of water because he was thirsty.  Then it started, his mind left him, he had the 1000 mile start, mouth gaped open and he collapsed. I was lucky I was there to grab him. I was even luckier that my best friends fiancee in a nurse at the hospital and she was right there when he fell. So he was brought in right away.  It was tough to watch and tough to deal with. His mind was gone and all of his strength was gone. It still is.  He was transferred to another hospital, but right now he's talking and can walk. Slowly. He's still confused and unable to remember most things. He's tough as nails and is worried about getting home because he has work to do.  The emergency room docs think he had a stroke but the doctor up here at the stroke centre isn't sure because his weakness is on both sides.  I wanted to bang out a thread last night as I paced my living room from 10-2am but I figured I'd let my brain settle.  Its hard not to think of the worst and what's gonna happen.  Thanks for listening."
691884,Ralph Field,2012-05-01 15:00:00,1018,"I wish all the best for your father. The staff, for the most part, do an excellent job in the emergency rooms. The fact that your father is talking about going home I would take as a good sign, however if he needs an operation he will get it faster if he is already hospitalized."
691886,NAW,2012-05-01 15:09:00,4022,"Not good to here.  We're all sending positive thoughts your way!  I hope your Dad has a speedy recovery, to what every is causing these problems."
691888,Gregoire,2012-05-01 15:14:00,1397,Very tough news to hear. I hope his recovery is quick.
691890,lew,2012-05-01 15:30:00,12766,Best of luck to your Dad Dave.  It's always hard to sit back and watch loved ones going through this type of thing.

691895,fishing n autograph,2012-05-01 15:41:00,2540,"Thanks guys, it was heart breaking to watch him work with the occupational therapist....he's a shell of what he once was"
691899,fishnsled,2012-05-01 15:51:00,3520,"All the best to your Dad and the family Dave.  Been on a reel roller caster ride with my mom over the past year with her heart. Several trips to the hospital, 2 last week of which one was to put in a defibrillator/pacemaker in, it seems to be helping her. Hopefully they can fix your Dad up and get him back to being himself real soon. As Sinclair said,"
691905,TJQ,2012-05-01 16:09:00,7806,"I've been dealing with some serious issues with my Dad. It's very very hard, I don't know how old your Dad is, but ill tell you this. Sometimes its important to remember a few things. #1 - some things will just not get better. It sucks to say it, but the sooner realized the better. Plan for the worst, hope for the best. #2 Suffering on his behalf, won't solve anything and he wouldn't want you to anyway. The best way to take care of him is to make sure your taking care of yourself. That way you have the strength both mentally and physically to do whats right and what needs to be done. I didnt do that for a while, and it nearly put and end to me as well.  It's taken me 4 months of thinking non stop about his situation to come to those conclusions... although there are days I still slip.  I hope things work out well for you and your Dad."
691909,mercman,2012-05-01 16:16:00,7054,"All the best wishes for your Dad Dave.The greatest gift we can give to our parents, is to just be there when they need us. Sounds to me like you are there for them Dave.That will make all the differance in the world.   Paul"
691910,Harrison,2012-05-01 16:18:00,2202," Man, these words hit home for me pal.  I watched my Dad slowly fade away over a year.  If I could share any of my experience it would be that I began to mourn while he was still here. Wish I would have of focused more on cherishing the time he was... there is lots of time to mourn.  Enjoy every moment you can.  Positive thoughts your way."
691911,bubbles,2012-05-01 16:18:00,591,Well said TJ.  Best of luck to your Dad Dave.

Good to know that he has a son that acts against his stubbornness, and that the incident occurred at the hospital.  Moments like that are critical to get immediate attention.  You can look back on how you stressed about the results of your shoulder injury.  It isn't so bad compared to the things that are happening around you.  All the best"
691957,Twocoda,2012-05-01 18:11:00,4130,Positive thoughts sent your way Dave for you and your family...
691965,Dontcryformejanhrdina,2012-05-01 18:40:00,535,"  I was in the same situation last year, it's extremely hard to see your father struggle like that and change so quickly. I hope your dad has a full recovery, it's good news that he's talking  and wanting to get back to his normal life."

692017,spincast,2012-05-01 21:52:00,3279,Positive thoughts for you and your family Dave. I  hope your Dad makes a full recovery and lives many more years to come. Take note of TJ's words - very true. Watching my Dad fade through Alzheimers almost ripped our family apart as I tried to do what could not be done. Luckily I realised the affect it was having and changed the tack before it was too late.
