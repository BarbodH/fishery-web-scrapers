691593,saneryin,2012-04-30 20:32:00,39,"Hi my friends (a couple) are heading down to Niagara Falls this weekend. May 4th, for one night.  Does anyone knows or have info about some websites to search motels, or any motels recommend?  I need clean rooms for 2 adults. Otherwise price will be first consideration.  As for location, surrounding 20km near the falls are ok'd too if price takes.  Any suggestions would be appreciated.  Thanks in advance"

691606,misfish,2012-04-30 20:46:00,29133,"What are their intentions? Fishing,sight seeing?  We recently stayed at the travel lodge. Close to everything. Walk out and turn left.Your in the heart of everything. Do the strip,hit the fallsview casino. Walk the falls path. Walk up the hill and hit the next casino. walk the other half of the strip back to the hotel. LCBO is a short walk right of the hotel as well. The Keg right across the street.  Cost us 112 bucks for the night (very clean and smoke free),and that included breakfast the next morning before we headed home. There are cheaper,but you get what you pay for. We liked the fact,we were right there. Fill up a traveler and we were off. WALKING."

691613,Billy Bob,2012-04-30 20:57:00,5865,Try this place.....VERY close to the falls and it's on Cliffton Hill where all the action is.....  http://www.nfcourtyard.com/
691614,esoxansteel,2012-04-30 20:59:00,1307,"Travel lodge by the Falls, was very reasonable around 70.00, its the one with the smittys rerstaurant in it, on Lundy's Lane"

691619,esoxansteel,2012-04-30 21:17:00,1307,Sorry the travel lodge is on ferry st. not lundy's lane
691632,misfish,2012-04-30 21:42:00,29133," Yes,and at that price,you must be a senior? My parents always brag, they get better rates."
691646,irishfield,2012-04-30 22:27:00,26272,48th floor of the Hilton is nice for a couple. Whirlpool tub with a peak a boo window from the bedroom and a seperate living room. The falls is so dead this time of year you can stay there almost as cheap as the travel lodge.
691656,misfish,2012-04-30 22:39:00,29133,Thats a nice view.
691684,gordy28,2012-04-30 23:38:00,638,Wife and I just got back from our annual Niagara Falls trip.  We are big fans of the Four Points by Sheraton.  Same complex as the Hilton but less expensive. Joined to the new casino and close to the falls.   Plus if you do the package deal you get a shuttle pass and a $40 gift cert for the Keg in the Embassy suites (which has an awesome falls view section). If they are planning on a weekend visit make sure they make a reservation at the Keg. Another tip-park at the casino-walk is easy to Four Points or the Hilton and its $5 for as long as you stay during the week and $10 over the weekend.  Most hotels charge you $12 - $20 a night Cheers Gordy
691705,wormdunker,2012-05-01 00:08:00,1711,"There R many hotels to visit.  Sheraton Fallsview, Hilton at the casino,Marriott, Sheraton 4 points etc etc.  If u R  looking for a cheaper rate travel a little west of the Falls along Lundys Lane.  The further U go from the Falls the cheaper it is.  Depends what U need/want.  Cairn Croft Best Western is reasonable, indoor pool, bar, live bands at night.  Best food is Mama Mias, 4 Brothers, for fine Italian dining go to Casa Mia on Portage Rd.  Tons of restaurants.  For wings, pizza, finger foods, best in the area Mick & Angelos on Lundys Lane.  Travel 15 minutes west on Hwy 20 (Lundys Lane)to Fonthill you'll be at my house!"
