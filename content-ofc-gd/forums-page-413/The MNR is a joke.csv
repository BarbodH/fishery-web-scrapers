691824,Harrison,2012-05-01 12:38:00,2202,  Huge market.  Turtles (Snappers and painted) and bull frogs.  If you run into a rope tied off to wood or brush with a big siwash hook on the end of it.  Chances are it is a turtle poacher rig.  Report the area right away.  Only reason I know this is I found some in the back of a Kawartha bay once in the spring.  Yellow nylon rope painted black.  Bring in big money in certain markets.

Don’t blame the CO,s As for  CO's I have seen 4 this year in the Oakville area and last year had them out on the boat I can guarantee they will be up the creek in Bronte this year and allot of people that shouldn’t be doing what they are doing are going to get a rude awakening we have been bending their ear a whole lot and its going to get ugly. As for pictures Ill take a picture of whatever the hell I want doesn’t mean I will make people crazy with it goes into the files. And yep I have ruffled feathers on here in the past and really can’t say for sure whether it won’t happen again.  Just Fish Dammit  Biteme"
691832,Christopheraaron,2012-05-01 12:49:00,3525," Say, what do you use to unhook a turtle?"
691835,mike rousseau,2012-05-01 13:05:00,4661, The probably leave the hook in the turtle and cut the line.... Maybe remove it once it's dead?  I've caught snappers while fishing for catfish with worms... But dont worry everyone...I won't post pics of OOS turtles... Wouldn't wanna get torn apart...lol
691843,mikeseb,2012-05-01 13:16:00,201, dont try to unhook a snapper! ittl be the last thing those fingers ever do lol
691857,Headhunter,2012-05-01 13:49:00,5703," Use a stick... a snapper will not let go of a stick, if you are holding it. Should you be unfortunate enough to hook a snapper, grab a stick and wave it in front of the turtle. It will grab and hold onto the stick. You can now remove the hook (assuming it not in it's mouth!)but never let go of the stick, until you have the hook out. HH"

692326,Twocoda,2012-05-02 21:02:00,4130,CO was at the river last night in my area...he was writing a fine up for someone fishing too close to the dam....i didnt get checked because i was out in the middle of the river...i would have gladly waded back to him if he would have asked...its refreshing to see them out and about.  If i had of noticed the guy fishing too close i would have said something to him and it would have saved him the fine...so to all that never speak up...keep it in mind your just trying to help someone else out
692345,Billy Bob,2012-05-02 22:02:00,5865,"I don't remember if I mention this or not.....back in late March I fished lake Erie for perch.....we were at about 1.5 away (east) from the pack of boats that were directly off Sturgeon Point.....we were anchored and another boat started to come in close to us....even before this happened we kept hearing a loud noise from the Canadian shore......as the other fishing boat was cruising around very close to us I looked behind us and could see a boat with something on the top of it closing VERY fast....I figured the U.S.A. Coast Guard.....I YELLED to the other boat to drop anchor and if they have to, put on PFD's......(before May 1st the new law requires this)....they did and as their boat settled in the Coast Guard went right on by us to check them out.......I said to my fishing partner ""were next"".....but after close to 30 minutes and everything was OK with other boat....the Coast Guard left and headed back to Buffalo....they had (3) two hundred horse outboards on that puppy.....that is what we heard from a distance.......As they pulled away I thought, that doesn't make sense...we are about 18 mile from Buffalo and there is about 30 boats less then 2 miles away and can be easily seen......but then as they were about 1/2 mile away, I looked at my watch...it was exactly NOON...lunch time I would guess...  So there goes your government agencies.....more waste then results I thought AGAIN...  BTW the other guys thanked us for the warning as they did not have any PFD on.......   Bob"

Just because some people do not speak English, does not mean that they are ""foreigners"" and that the rules do not apply to them. The only way for new fishermen and people new to Canada or the Province will learn what they can and can not do is by being informed, either by the Regulations, the CO's, or by fellow fishing enthusiasts.

Its a safety thing...........I have NEVER once seen a CO at bronte, petrocan or the bridges! As for the guys who claim the only reason theyre in the run tribs is for suckers...... nice try!

691406,mikeseb,2012-04-30 14:06:00,201,"So over the month of april, i did a ton of sucker fishing on a local creek.  Almost every time I went out i saw people clearly targeting rainbow trout (using roe, 10ft+ rods etc).  Every time I would call the MNR report line but of course those CO`S are to busy sleeping with the dog (for lack of a better word).  Then one day i encountered two people, a father and son, that were fishing roe with centerpin reels and raven float rods.  I told them they were breaking the law and they looked at me as if i was speaking a different language.  When i was leaving the creek to go get picked up i saw the 2 guys loading a steelhead into there car!! once again i told them it was illigal and they ignored me.  I took tons of pictures of them including there licence plate and filed another report to the MNR including pictures and after following up with them i found out again nothing was done.  Then about a week after that i saw the same 2 guys snag a bow and cut out a hole where the roe is on the fish and squeeze about half a ziploc bag of roe out of the fish, and then he threw it back!!  Again i was taking tons of pictures and filed another report to the MNR and after following up, NOTHING WAS DONE!!  Im not one to take the law into my own hands, but i think next time I see people fishing OOS (especially the father and son) and continue to do so after i warn them its illegal, i might accidentally step on a 500 dollar rod and warp a 500 dollar reel.  What would you guys do if you where in my shoes?"
691409,Fisher_1,2012-04-30 14:12:00,22,Thats NOT right. We have those rules for a reason and people need to follow them. The fact that the MNR isnt doing anything is crap. Down my way i heard about a couple guys tossing crankbait with a steel leader tied on for pike got a fine.
691411,woodenboater,2012-04-30 14:13:00,2277,You're doing all you can do short of writing to your local MPP. Would be great if local tackle shops posted photos of said miscreants on a wall of fame for all to see.

691426,whiskywizard,2012-04-30 14:50:00,305,"Don't do that; you'll wind up in more trouble than it's worth.  I understand and empathize with your outrage, but don't go so far that's it's you who is doing the explaining to the police, CO, or court.  Just keep reporting the event/date/time/location and the licence plate number. You've certainly done your part and should be able to sleep well knowing you did.  And be discreet taking any photos; you never know when one of these clowns will take serious offense and turn it into something really ugly.   I agree. You know of pike poachers being fined. I know of white-bucket-brigaders getting checked. We shouldn't say the MNR is doing nothing. The MNR is doing what it can with the resources it has. The MNR needs more COs. We should all tell our MPPs, in wiriting, that we want more MNR enforcement.    Your first point is a great one; I will do it too. Point 2 really won't fly. If you owned the tackle shop, would you post the poachers' pictures? They aren't guilty yet. And how do you know the guy telling you the story is any more legitimate than those he's complaining about.    I like this idea.   ."
691427,Headhunter,2012-04-30 14:50:00,5703,"Correct me if I'm wrong, but wouldn't local police be interested? Do they not work hand in hand with MNR in these situations? Kudo's to you for trying. HH"

I've called the tips line on more then one occasion and they've shown up every time, late, but they did show up.  I see the same group of CO's pretty regularly and speak with them when I get a chance. Even they say it's tough because that one boat is patrolling a huge stretch of the river.  Your doing what you can and should feel good about that. One day that couple will get what they have coming to them."
691457,BCLT,2012-04-30 16:33:00,86,"   Hmm this seems shady to me....... a ton of sucker fishing eh. I dont know one guy who fishes a pin, or spin for bows who TARGETS suckers...... are  you telling me that if you nailed a bow, or a brown you wouldnt reel it in?  Now I can agree with you about the cutting a hole in the fish for roe, that is brutality at its best......But Its rather convenient that this has been posted right after the lad who posted his bass! Ill tell ya man, I agree with you when it comes to poaching etc...... but sometimes you have to mind your own business..... are you a cop? are you a part of the ministry? As for the ministry there is a reason why they dont go to certain places where poaching is considered an everyday thing..... its because some cultures dont understand our laws and to them fish is food....... now have you ever tried to take food from a hungry dog? Not a pretty sight.... and its for this reason many COs dont go to these places........ why endanger themselves...if this wasnt the case they would be down at bronte all the time! Moving forward I see the ministry everywhere I go, and im out 5 days a week at least....... I have seen them at credit, bronte, hamilton harbour (laselle, pier 8, valley inn) Brantfords wilkes dam just to name a few............. You need to relax a little! Next your going to be asking people for the license lol  "
691461,BillM,2012-04-30 16:53:00,17367,"I'm sure those guys with expensive float setups are just dying to put food on the table, give me a break.  I also didn't realize that coming from a certain culture was an excuse to ignore the fishing regulations..  Can you make up anymore excuses for these idiots?  I've phoned the TIPS line on more then one occasion and will continue to do so."
691469,Headhunter,2012-04-30 17:20:00,5703,  REALLY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! You have got to be kidding me... condoning illegal activities at any level is not cool! And a huge plus a million to what Bill said! HH
691472,mikeseb,2012-04-30 17:31:00,201, is this a joke?
691476,rocheleauc,2012-04-30 17:36:00,205," Me and a few buddies all fish Pins and we legitimately went out to target suckers a few times before opener.  Of course only in open water.  They're actually a lot of fun on the pin especially the bigger ones..  Also agree with what BillM said, coming from certain cultures doesn't mean the rules don't apply to them."
691479,HTHM,2012-04-30 17:40:00,4082,"Call the OPP or local police, they will have to respond to a complaint of a ""crime in progress"". (Am I correct in saying that F&A?)"
691480,Harrison,2012-04-30 17:43:00,2202,Do contact your MPP and the Minister of Natural Resources. Let them know exactly how frustrated you are and include your examples above.  CO's are run thin as it is.  I think this is turtle poaching time too if I am not wrong.
691487,fishindevil,2012-04-30 17:59:00,6254,yes the mnr is out looking for turtle poachers right now seen them last friday !!! its a huge problem in the kawartha lakes area where i live !!! its not just all about trout ??/ so many miss informed people ....
691490,adempsey,2012-04-30 18:04:00,1498,"I can't say that I am up on the operations of the MNR, but I have a feeling that there is no money ""to go anywhere"" and they are under staffed.  Have you visited a public school or hospital lately?  IMO, everything is a mess and unfortunately the MNR is not a top priority.  Maybe they need to start a volunteer CO program or something."
691491,mike rousseau,2012-04-30 18:14:00,4661,on the other side of the coin... ive aquired the cell number of my local CO...theres only one... and i call him directly... hes usually at the scene in 20 minutes....one time it was 5 minutes tops...   there are good and bad people throughout the mnr im sure... in your case thats discusting.... i guess im lucky my CO cares
691494,jedimaster,2012-04-30 18:17:00,3472,"I saw a CO writting up a pair of guys fishing on the credit somwere this weekend. He ad is ticket book out and was pointing somethign out to tem in the regs. I am not sure what it was, as I was just driving past. All you can really do is cal it in. take a picture and mail it to the MnR. To my understanding the MnR focuses there efforts on areas where they are most likely to catch someone. If an area keeps getting calls then is may get checked next season.  I don't think I would support a volunteer CO setup. It would cost so much money to get up and running. What if te volunteers get shot or beat up, or start a fight. Not a good scenario. CO's have alot of powers, and this is not something I would want to give to a volunteer CO."
691499,dave524,2012-04-30 18:25:00,4508," You have to remember that they enforce the hunting regs too. In the past a couple of my buddies were CO's back when I worked for the Ministry. During the controlled deer hunt in the south all manpower was focused on that, you could have got away with murder with a rod in your hand, I expect the spring tukey season is drawing manpower away from fisheries enforcement as well. I would expect a guy with a gun would take priority over a fisherman when a call came in."
691516,Realsteel19,2012-04-30 18:46:00,19,I see volunteer groups that are more educated then the MNR!
691523,Billy Bob,2012-04-30 18:51:00,5865,From what I have seen here at times.....  They would not only arrest the culprit but also hang him/her in the city square by his stringer before nightfall......
