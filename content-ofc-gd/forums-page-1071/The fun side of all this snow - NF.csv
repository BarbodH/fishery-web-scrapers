169735,ccmtcanada,2008-03-10 23:18:00,7971,"I took the day off work today.  With all that snow on our front lawn, and a bored 5 year old inside the house, we decided to head to the front yard...I gave her a shovel and said go make a hole in the yard...LOL.  Here's what it looked like before we started...   That worked for about a minute...she then said, ""I need help daddy"".  So, I went out and dug a huge hole in the ground that measured maybe 3 by 4 feet.  Here's a shot of her standing in it.....   Then she informed me that just one hole was boring and could I make a hallway and a bedroom?  I just laughed, but she was dead serious.  20 minutes later, with me out of breath, she walked through her new house and tried it out....   She THEN informed me that she needed stairs because it was too hard for her to get in and out of her new house....10 minutes later and here they are....   Then came the final inspection...I was out of breath, ready for a nap....you can see the stairs, the first room, the hallway and the bedroom.   I told her it was time to head inside for hot chocolate, but she said ""Daddy...we cant go yet...my bedroom is too small and where am I supposed to eat?"".  I just looked at her completely flabbergasted....sweat pouring off my face and said ""Are you serious?"".  She put her hands on her hips and said ""Do I look like it?""  We ended up coming inside...the third room and expansion will have to come tomorrow....LOL.  Here's a final shot of her making a secret entrance to her room....   I get to go back to work tomorrow so I can relax....LOL."
169738,Mike the Pike,2008-03-10 23:24:00,3421,Very nice Cliff looks like you worked hard .Now fill up the hole with water stock it with fish and pratice your ice fishing.
169746,Joey,2008-03-10 23:35:00,9122,"Very nice Cliff.  Gives me memories of when Big Al was Little Al and he loved the snow.  Here's a funny story that comes to mind.  He was about your daughters age and it was halloween.  It was in Calgary and there was alot of snow and it was COLD.  He was going to be Daniel Boon and I wanted him to be warm, so I got him dressed in his one piece pajama, two pairs of sweat pants and shirts and his jacket and snow pants and then his outfit on top complete with coon hat.  We made it one house down and he says ""Mom, I have to go to the bathroom.""  Joey"
169836,ecxstriper,2008-03-11 01:19:00,343,Hey where are the fish pictures . I have seen enough snow shots I want some fish porn. Oh and when do you think she'll be ready for the sheet rock ?
169849,fatherof3,2008-03-11 01:46:00,1769,"great story,brings back childhood memories"
169853,irishfield,2008-03-11 01:52:00,26272, Wonder whom she learned that one from....
169856,ccmtcanada,2008-03-11 01:56:00,7971, Ahh...those dreaded words...LOL.  I did that to my parents a few times too....haha.
169858,ccmtcanada,2008-03-11 01:57:00,7971, The fish are safely swimming around in water somewhere....LOL.  Sheet rock....hmmm...can you be here tomorrow?
169862,ccmtcanada,2008-03-11 02:03:00,7971, I have no idea what you're talking about Wayne.  
169863,Greencoachdog,2008-03-11 02:06:00,8163," Looks like you're gonna have your hands full with the drywall Alex... that hole doesn't look to ""square"" to me.   Great Pics Cliff!... next time make her an Igloo!!!"
169985,wallyboss,2008-03-11 16:19:00,1095,"The tunnel to the other room???  Just a friendly advice but did you hear the news about the 8 year old from Campbellton N.B., the tunnel collapsed!!"
170011,ketchenany,2008-03-11 18:29:00,3229,"Cliff, do collape the tunnel when you're not with  them, you never know."
170017,TJQ,2008-03-11 18:45:00,7806,Make sure you take your aspirin for your heart....
170019,ccmtcanada,2008-03-11 18:49:00,7971,"   Shortly after that pic was taken, I told her that it couldn't be any bigger than it was...just for those reasons.  She now filled it up with diamonds (snowballs)....LOL.  I did have the safety thing in mind, and told her she could not dig it any further than she had already...after I explained why, she said ok.  She had a friend over today playing, who wanted to make it bigger and I heard her say that they couldn't because it's not safe...makes a dad proud....haha."
170022,wallyboss,2008-03-11 18:55:00,1095,The right age to teach them new things.   Cause if you wait until there teenagers they will already know everything
170146,ketchenany,2008-03-11 23:46:00,3229,"Cliff, kids that listen to their parents end up working at CT's head office  . .   I have two and proud, just like you."
