I think that I remember getting some in the past in the newspaper. By the time I drive there and park and pay to get in (with wife and kid in tow) I am looking at $60; and thatâ€™s before eating and the odd beverage! ($9 for my six year old, can you say ""gouge"") Yes I know this is like the Mecca for outdoorsmen, but sixty bucks would buy my power baits for the season. Thanks."
169506,John,2008-03-10 13:35:00,2956,There is a family pass available for $38.00 (2 adults and two children) and I believe free parking at Ontario Place if you don't mind a 10 minute walk.

169515,ricoboxing,2008-03-10 13:59:00,398,your kid is only 5 years old.   i just saved you 9 bucks!
169517,bbog,2008-03-10 14:21:00,665,OFAH members received $2 off coupons attached to the latest Ontario Out of Doors magazine.  Seems your family rate/free parking at Ontario Place are your best bets.
169729,pikehunter,2008-03-10 23:10:00,1659,There was a $2 off coupon in the Sun a few days ago.  Just take the 60 or more bucks you'll spend and go to LeBaron and BPS and make a day out of it. Spend what you save on fast food and gear.
