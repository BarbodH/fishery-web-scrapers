169674,irishfield,2008-03-10 21:31:00,26272,"The hold doesn't do it justice at all. I know how big my 37""r was... and this thing stays thick right to the tail. Wish you had of got a two hand hold shot Robert...and a head close up. I might be able to zoom on the head as I have the 3meg original.  That thing swims around swallowing 5 lb whitefish whole!"
