170438,K-K-DAWG,2008-03-12 18:35:00,31,"OK, you asked for it....now your gonna get it!!   My email in-box is full...my phone message system is full...you have dragged me away from my back-busting workout.... so now your gonna sit up in that chair of yours, lean in real tight to the computer screen and hear `da DAWG`s bark weather you want to or not!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  got your attention eh???? thought so-  What kind of world would we live in if there was only ONE fishing show? One lure company? One boat manufacturer? One lake to fish? One specie of fish to fish for? One fishing host? pretty darn boring stuff eh?  I personally grew up watching every show mentioned...hence the inspiration to have the guts to try it myself...easy?, far from it.  I take my sponsored-logo hat off to each and every fishing show and host our there...  Watch the shows you like. Turn off the shows you don`t like. Negative comments by negative people do NOTHING but bring negative attention to our great sport, hobby and passion!  To those who like Extreme Angler TV, watch us, order our swag, enter our contests and have said so, ""thank you"". Our show, and others with the same format are created to ENTERTAIN, EDUCATE & INSPIRE ENTERTAIN...as in entertainment. EDUCATE, meaning teaching YOU, how to do the things we do, on YOUR favorite bodies of water. INSPIRE, ...as in the anglers of tomorrow, the NEXT generation.    We should be grateful that we as Canadians have freedom of speech. unlike some of the countries our proud military are presently occupying.... be-heading is not yet a penalty for having an opinion.  There.... I have said all I want to say on this subject. now go to our website and buy something expensive already....and lots of them!  KK (with a DAWG in his name)"
170441,TOM C,2008-03-12 18:44:00,76,"INSERT THIS ABOVE DAWGS POST LOL I type slow  Gee now you have gone and done it, I wasnt going to post on this but I TOOKS ALL I CAN STAND AND I CAN STANDS NO MORE (not spelling errors, just a great quote from bugs bunny) Its amazing how different everyone looks at things, I give Mike alot of credit for coming on here and even responding to what is being said,( and I dont care who you are, some of this has got to sting) as I have gottin to know some of the guys who are doing some of the shows, I have seen how hard they try and put on a show that people want to watch, and if you take bits and pieces of just the post in this thread you will see how hard it is to please everyone, there are only so many ways you tell or show someone how to catch a fish, so once you have seen 100 LM bass caught what more do you think anyone can show you, So what is someone to do to keep your interest week after week, I for one thank these folks for even trying to entertain me for an hour. Is there a show out there that I make sure I dont miss, NO, but am glad they are there when I want to watch. So if anyone out there thinks they can do a better job, feel free to put up your money and film a show, but remember to tell me about the sting when I tell you I hate you and your show."
170443,fishinggeek,2008-03-12 18:50:00,325,"This thread has certainly brought out our local fishing celebrities!  Welcome to the board Mike and Karl.  Karl, you seem to speak out against negative comments of your show but in favour of free speech.  Maybe I'm reading it wrong, but this sent mixed messages to me.  In any event, should we not simply speak our minds openly and honestly?  If I have a bad experience with a poorly manufactured reel, rude resort owner, or don't like the colour schemes of a lure company, wouldn't it be nice to let others know my opinion, such as fellow OFC'ers, sponsors, and networks?  I see no difference in these examples as in being honestly critical (without being defamatory) in a fishing show.  Like a few others, I do not care for Extreme Angler or Fishing Canada for various reasons.  Many OFC'ers, however, are big fans of the show.  I respect your fans and expect the same in return."
170446,Millertime,2008-03-12 18:58:00,2,Hey I take the criticism and the compliments. I'm not here to Justify what I do. KK well said......Been a long time! Tom...Total respect your obviously a decent human being.  I am just glad We have given you guys so much to talk about!  Meantime I have job to do and will continue to do it the best way I can.....  And hey Like FNC or hate it......It is not even on anymore and was two years ago! Get with the times......  Miller
170453,Terry,2008-03-12 19:14:00,14456,"so you say...We should be grateful that we as Canadians have freedom of speech.... but then.. Negative comments by negative people do NOTHING but bring negative attention to our great sport, hobby and passion!  but free speech allows us to say what we think....the good the bad and the ugly..... the last 2 referring to Fish'n Canada ....LOL and if I like something I will be just as outspoken about it..not just the negative ones...."
170463,cityfisher,2008-03-12 19:26:00,959,There are many great shows on WFN and lots of crappy shows. Fishing with Shelly and Courtney for example..lol... sorry but chicks that are scared holding fish and ALWAYS have guides with them shouldnt be hosting a show.  I like both shows FNC and EXTANG . If you dont like it dont watch it.  ROCK ON !
170486,TJQ,2008-03-12 19:55:00,7806,"I gotta say this, I've done a few ""Internet Only - amateur shows.."" and I tell ya... it is very difficult to come up with anything new all the time like that... (I have to cook a turkey for something to do...) I'm just glad I don't have to make a living doing it, cause it really isn't easy.  Ive seen some show production and its not easy to put all that together.  Criticizing shows is one thing and Its GREAT that Mike got on here to defend his show!  It shows that someones paying attention, which is good!  One thing about forums is its easy to criticize when your not standing in front of the individual that your criticizing, I expect the conversation would be a bit different if you were...  However, being on the top of the heap, does put you in the line of fire and most fishing show hosts I know have pretty thick skins and can handle it.  I think constructive criticism is great, we get comments here every day and sometimes we take 'em and sometimes we don't.  thats just the way she goes.  Once again though kudo's for the replies."
170488,Hookset,2008-03-12 20:01:00,367,"Nope ...sorry...not impressed with those replies at all.  If you want to learn, grow, and improve, patting yourself on the back, or getting patted will do you absolutely no good. I've been in the customer service field in one way or the other for over 20 years.  Ok you asked for it now you're gonna get it ? Give me a break.  The absolute BEST tool for insuring your show can stay on top and improve is to ""man up"" and listen very closely to criticism. You should almost be begging for this type of response. You have no information to improve upon when people are blowing sunshine up your butt. The best reply you guys could have made would have been a mature response to thank all those who posted both positively and negatively and in some form or other attempt to address the negative issues that you are so very lucky to have read and hopefully understood.  You've got a great opportunity to improve, and if you decide not to, then you at least cannot say that you do not know the reason for which you failed. Personally i love both shows, except the music on one, but that's why I have a volume control on the remote.  Good Luck,   Hookset."
170490,TJQ,2008-03-12 20:09:00,7806,Good ending to the thread.. i think we all get the point here.
170387,Millertime,2008-03-12 16:19:00,2,"Hey...nice to see you all have an opinion! Sad to see that you can be so vile.... LOL!!!!!! The life of a professional angler is not as simple as you all seem to think...but it is a fun one... For those Fans out there,,,,,Thanks for watching....BBM and Nielson Ratings don't lie... FYI...Fish'n Canada is Number one on Television ""Nationally"" The old saying ""everyone likes to hate a winner"" obviously applies here.  I'm sure all your criticism has a place...... But chill out guys and enjoy fishing and these forums for something a little more productive.... Like what you like and watch what you watch, Every show has a place on the tube.  At the end of the day we are all just guys that like to cast for little green fish......  Thanks for the forum......  Mike Miller"
170401,Mike Pike,2008-03-12 16:42:00,1332,"And Mike remember, it's when we STOP talkin' about ya that you have to worry!  LOL  Cheers and welcome to da board!"
170407,GbayGiant,2008-03-12 17:04:00,1780,"Damn, I thought Izumi and Real Fishing would be number one. Honestly I like Extreme and Fishin Canada, at the top of the list for me next to Bobby, Mercer's Fishing Facts and Musky Hunter. As for the music and sound effects I think there trying to appeal to a younger/middle age American audience, personally I only watch the shows to see the fish being caught, witch are the real stars of any show anyway. One show that drives me crazy is Cronzie's show where he waists three quarters of the show talking about shore lunch, lol, and then theres that American show (I forget the show, think it's Lunkerville) the guy breaths heavy like he just ran a 100 metre sprint every time he gets a musky or pike, lol,  but all in all I like all the guys but all the shows are repetitive and have the same advice over and over it's just whats new each year for lures, so once again I watch for the fish being caught anyway, they all have their flaws like everyone."
170408,pigeonfisher,2008-03-12 17:09:00,696,Nice first post Mike...hahahaha  Some of the criticisms may be warranted.  It's easy though to be a critic on the internet.
170425,Terry,2008-03-12 18:02:00,14456,"Mike Miller, if you think that I hate  Fish'n Canada  because it's number one..you are dead wrong and I am sure as the new numbers come out they will go down faster then a ..well I shouldn't say....  it has become a joke.... the day they put on that show where  they all thought they were 13 again and swearing and what not they lost me..for ever..till that point I had never missed a show, now you couldn't pay me enough....   if that is being number one and they looked more like number 2, I think I will watch the higher numbers..cause they stink period...... I hate  Fish'n Canada  because it's number one..what a joke....they jumped the shark.."
170432,Headhunter,2008-03-12 18:18:00,5703,"Millartime... it seems to me that a large number of your show's viewers have opinions about your show, and have expressed them here... admittedly, some more eloquently than others, but what I find most disconcerting regarding your post is this; Here you have a captive audience and instead of using the criticism to perhaps ""improve"" your show, you have taken exactly the opposite tact. I wish I had a place like this for my clients to discuss what they do and don't like about my service. I'd be sure to keep an eye on it and introduce effective measures to help keep my business number one! To be honest, I'm pretty disappointed in your response. HH"
169641,bassman,2008-03-10 20:04:00,384,"About 1 1/2 years ago I called one of the local radio stations during the Outdoor Journal, which is hosted by the Fish'nCanada guys. As a caller I was awarded a prize for calling the show. I waited about 2-3 months and received nothing. I have sent 3-4 messages to the FNC folks over the past year with absolutely no response, and I have yet to receive my prize. Initially, I was disappointed that Fish'nCanada changed their format which was absolutely ridiculous, but I'm also upset that these idiots lost a fan and a viewer over a $20-30 prize. Has anyone else had any problems with these guys?  Cheers!"
169644,irishfield,2008-03-10 20:12:00,26272,Did you give them a waypoint to send it to?
169645,bassman,2008-03-10 20:14:00,384,"Yes sir, once on the show, and a few times via e-mail."
169646,PERCHER,2008-03-10 20:14:00,787,
169649,Terry,2008-03-10 20:22:00,14456,well I gave up on these morons after they tried to be 14 year old gangsta rappers cursing and swearing and slapping fish back into the water in the motorhome going down the road they were harassing the driver and throwing things at him......  it was late night tv at best and had little to do with fishing...and if 40 and 50 plus year old tv hosts thaought that it was a good idea..then I would have nothing to do with them again....  and in the year and 1/2 I have not watch their show   and I put them down ever chance I get.......they are almost as bad as the dime bag fishermen show
169651,bassman,2008-03-10 20:26:00,384,"Thanks Terry, I told them the same thing when I called the show. Not a surprise that I never got my prize. Oh well, their loss not mine."
169653,Big Cliff,2008-03-10 20:27:00,6899,"Glad you posted this! If they ignore you long enough, you will go away, I wonder how many other people will go away too? Customer service is a rare commodity these days. It costs a lot of money to generate a new customer, I wonder what their $20.00-$30.00 gift will cost them in lost customers?"
169665,fishinggeek,2008-03-10 21:18:00,325,"I've given up on them too.  Ever since they hired Mike, the show has gone way downhill IMHO.  It's much less informative.  I keep meaning to get the address of WFN to complain about this show and extreme angler, which is another one that annoys me.  If anyone does the same, please PM me the address.  Not only do I find these ones annoying, but I actually do other things (like errands, watch other channels) so I don't have to watch it.  I think letters like this might sway them to change their programming.  I have heard complaint letters, especially ones explicitly stating the viewer is both dissatisfied AND not watching the show, send a strong signal.  Any show that has to do an ""uncut"" version (in quotes as it seems more scripted than uncut) or has middle-aged hosts with ""dawg"" in their nicknames are not worth my time.  I know they are trying to draw a younger audience, but I'm not that old myself and cringe everytime I click past these shows."
169667,walleyejigger,2008-03-10 21:23:00,876,^^^^^^^^^uhh ohh ^^^^^^^^
169668,fishinggeek,2008-03-10 21:25:00,325,"Just my humble, candid opinion, of course!"
169678,Gerritt,2008-03-10 21:33:00,6129,Even though they are a paid advertiser here.. and help out with donations for the Tyler Fundraiser etc.... He is still entitled to his opinion WJ... you cant please everyone all the time unfortunately.  G
169681,walleyejigger,2008-03-10 21:38:00,876,"sounds good, i'll remember that"
169685,Gerritt,2008-03-10 21:44:00,6129,It killed me to say that.... you know that right? LOL! as I am the most opinionated................   G
169694,bigfish1965,2008-03-10 21:55:00,3382,I don't know that fish'n'canada is a sponsor here....
169700,Terry,2008-03-10 22:03:00,14456,hell I hope they aren't .................
169701,sonny,2008-03-10 22:03:00,511,"Well as i was growing up i was always told that if you didn't have something nice to say then you shouldn't say anything at all,,,,hmmm  i happen to enjoy the show as i enjoy all the shows,, I might not enjoy all the types of fishing a show is doing but i just might see or hear something that might help me in my adventures,,,If a show makes it to air there's proprably a reason it did,,,,maybe not enough for you but maybe for someone else,,,,and as for your prises bassman,,,,i am sure it was the resposibility of the radio station to award prises for calling in,,,which would be the norm"
169702,Gerritt,2008-03-10 22:04:00,6129,I meant Extreme Angler....  G
169708,kennyman,2008-03-10 22:30:00,737,"Sorry I like them both. Extreme Angler and Fish N Canada. I'd love to go fishing with Pete Bowman or just about anyone from Extreme Angler. I can understand why some don't, but that doesn't mean it shouldn't be on the air. To each his own. Now them not coughing up a prize is wrong, but it sounds to me like it was the radio stations responsibility and them you should have been going after. Now if you called  Fish N Canada and explained what happened and I was runnung the place I would take care of customer and just send it out anyway ......... but if you called with some serious attitude (as above) and I had already fulfilled my end of the bargain (assuming the radio station is at fault) I wouldn't blame them for not sending it. Put yourself in their position. Sometimes it's the way you approach the problem that gets it solved or not. Sorry, JMHO."
169743,holdfast,2008-03-10 23:29:00,1813,"Yup, I agree 100% with what Bassman has to say.  I got no personal ties with that show, and all All I can tell ya its almost as bad as the Dimestore Idiots but at least their jokes arent half as bad.  I havent watched it for a while Thanks to the that new host who has to go.  Its too bad because at one time they fished waters not too far from where I lived and that Fishing Cull show in NorthBay was awesome to watch.  Sadly I now rate them just above the Dimestore Morons, The Rod and Reel, Shellys and Courtneys Horror Show."
169754,dheitzner,2008-03-10 23:44:00,314," IMHO, Extreme Angler is the best show on WFN, hands down; especially if you are a Southern Ontario fisherman.  They have strong segments, pertinent information and useful tips,  not to mention the Extreme Fishing Annual, which is a killer magazine. Don't badmouth those guys, they are doing great things. Darcy"
169779,fishindevil,2008-03-11 00:12:00,6254,"Well the show used to be alot better in the old days,and yes the new host,well has got to go,im not a regular viewer thanks to him,as there is much better shows on now,as i have WFN,shows like the next bite,extreame angler,the FLW walleye/bass tour.  ...man there is lots that are far better and more sincere than the fishin-canada show,they once asked my buddy and me to move out of our fishing spot at the wilmot,so they could catch a fish as they couldnt catch one for over 2 hours......so of course we said hell no !!!!!as they wernt even polite,then came the """"DO YOU KNOW WHO WE ARE LINE OF CRAP !!!! you can have it when we leave,they didnt even say thanks !!!!!so yes i know how you feel i do hope you get your prize...cheers"
169791,danbouck,2008-03-11 00:28:00,4380,I personally still like the show. It is still very informative and A LOT of people are still watching!
169811,Jigger,2008-03-11 00:49:00,1237,"Apples and oranges. FNC shows you where to go and how much of a great time you can have if you follow their co-ordinates. Extreme Angler is a much more in-depth look at the techniques and tools to use in an appropriate situation. The target audience is probably a little different, too.  FNC= casual/recreational  X-Treme A= more than casual... much more."
169822,kennyman,2008-03-11 01:03:00,737,I don't want to upset anyone!
169828,MuskyBill,2008-03-11 01:09:00,311,"HAHAHA, ya gotta be careful what you say about these guys on this board, or they'll threaten to sick their lawyers on someone in admin.
