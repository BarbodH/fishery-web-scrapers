I want one that collapses like most other fishing boats.  I have in the last two years built my own temporary tops and they worked great but I want an actual top that looks like it belongs and is a bit more asthetically pleasing.  I want to be able to make it enclosed with side plastic windows too.  I am just wondering if any of you know where I can get one made for a reasonable price and not more than a couple of hours from Ottawa.  I looked for an Alumacraft dealer but cant find any reasonable close and besides they would charge a tonne.  Any infor would be appreciated.  Thanks  Don"
170291,cranks bait,2008-03-12 12:48:00,721,Try contacting the local marinas to see if they can recomend someone.  Also try an upholster.  I had a soft top made for my Blazer way back when.  It was in Hinton Alberta though so no good on giving you the name.

170427,Terry,2008-03-12 18:07:00,14456,I would also contact the boat company and see if they have standard tops for their boats custom boat tops can be pricey
