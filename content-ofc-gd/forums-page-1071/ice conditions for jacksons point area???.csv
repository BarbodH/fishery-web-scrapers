170023,fisher,2008-03-11 18:57:00,451,My buddy and I are planning to head out of Willow Beach tomorrow morning  - not sure if that is when you were planning on going.  We llan to be at the grocery store at the corner of Lake and Kennedy at around 6:30 - 7:00 am to pick up some minnows there.  It would be great to have others to go together with - we can try different patterns.  I am not comfortable taking my vehicle out there so we are currently planning to walk in - but I do hear there are others taking their vehicles out.  Let me know.  Plan on signing off the computer by 4 this afternoon.  Feel free to call me.  I have pm'd you my cell.

170116,Skud,2008-03-11 22:28:00,739,"I was at Willow Beach on Sat and there were many trucks driving around. There is over 20"" of good ice but there are pressure cracks too. A truck did get stuck in one on Sat.  Lots of snow to make driving tricky and walking a hard chore.  I got skunked out there. I blame it on the weather"
170139,steelhedrmatt,2008-03-11 23:31:00,278,"Hey Al... went out yesterday to shanty bay. There I would say no. snow was knee deep. Mid lake MIGHT be different with the winds out there but I doubt it. plus temps for the next couple a days, so Saturday might be a different story. Take a shovel if you go and make sure your phones charged. let me know how you make out.."
170232,snagmaster,2008-03-12 05:08:00,250,"thanks Matt and skud....getting alot of mixed reviews..but its knee deep in shanty bay, that doesnt sound good....guess i got to wait till thursday night to decide..... Lay into those Brookies up there Matt its going to be sweet weather and im sure the fish will be on.."
