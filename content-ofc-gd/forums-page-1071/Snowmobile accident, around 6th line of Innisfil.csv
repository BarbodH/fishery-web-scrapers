It's been reported to us that there was a snowmobile accident around the 6th line of Innisfil, on the lake today.  Someone hitting the pressure crack and hurting themselves bad...  We don't have details but heard A Channel was there...boat and helicopter was out as well as police and paramedic’s.  We were all commenting on the snow depth and how it covers the pressure cracks, yesterday when we were out there... Please be careful out there...  I hope who ever it was, that they are alright…  Lady…"
