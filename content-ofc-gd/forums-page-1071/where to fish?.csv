Would appreciate any feedback you can give me on these lodges and the fishing in either of these two bodies of water."
36832,ehg,2007-02-20 14:14:00,2666,"You probably couldn't go wrong at either place. Bass and even pike usually hit topwaters on the many quiet bays of Kashawakamak on July evenings. There are some walleye a little deeper there as well.  Good luck,  ehg"
37182,lunkerbasshunter,2007-02-21 00:20:00,2585,"kash has some decent fishing, about 5 years ago we were cathcing alot of small ones but the small ones should be great sized now.  but i would go for marten river.  i here the fishing is outstanding.  Cheers!"
37192,irishfield,2007-02-21 00:34:00,26272,"I bet Martin River Lodge is in tip top shape and they'll take great care of you...as it's for sale. Bet the service is top notch as they search for a prospective buyer. Martin River is a beautiful place, but the fishin (like many places) can be tough in the summer months.  "
46743,kipdynamite,2007-03-14 01:52:00,6, How about the Marten River Area in late May for Pickerel?  I've been fishing the Rice Lake/Trent Waterway area for Pickerel but have has limited success the last few years.  I was thinking of heading up to Marten River or Red Cedar Lake.

My Uncle and my Parents owned it many moons ago when I was just a wee grasshopper. Yes thismissfishes, the fishing is great if you know where to go and depending on the time of year. Lots of Pike and Lake Trout as well as Walleye. If you can find a map of the area, I will mark a few awesome spots for you to try. You may want to consider having the Lodge put a boat up into Wickstead above the damn and spend a day up there as well, the fishing is amazing in certain spots."

Jigs with white twister tail grubs caught us a good meal of walleye the one day and the next day we hooked into a few smallies and a pike.  Really enjoyed the fishing and scenery."
