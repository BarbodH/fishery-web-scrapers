I have found many to be exceptional in providing technicial support/customer service (a company called Cutco is one such company, lifetime warranty on their products and they mean it and support it) but I have also found several to be almost impossible to deal with. Dropped calls, long waits, technical staff that either don't have a clue or don't care. Sometimes you can't even get through to a person or if you do, they promise to get back to you and you never hear from them again. (Bell Sympatico, GM, are you listening?)  Anyway, I have found it to be a really good measure of what I can expect from a company and/or their products and just thought I'd like to share it. might even save someone some money or frustration!"

When you are asked right at the start which language you prefer, and you choose ENGLISH, why do you, nearly 50% of the time, get someone with an accent so heavy that you have to ask them 3 or 4 times to repeat themselves? Although I realize they need a job too, and very well may be very good at what they do, I often just hang up, and try again, hoping to get someone I can understand. I KNOW that's rude, and NOT the technician's fault, but what are you to do, if you simply cannot understand them? The call centre is in New Brunswick, at least that's Canada!"
