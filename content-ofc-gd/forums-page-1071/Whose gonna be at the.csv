170220,maybe,2008-03-12 04:02:00,307,"Google maps aerial photo of the Direct Energy Center.  Tomorrow I'm aiming for the lot directly across Princes' Blvd from the building entrance.  Had no problems getting nice spaces there on weekdays during the boat show this year & last.  For Saturday, we'll likely get stuck in no-man's land again - the lot southwest of Nova Scotia Ave.   I'll be the long-haired 30-something gal in a light green Bass Pro t-shirt.  Small cartoon walleye on the front, and a big one on the back.  I wear glasses, and will be carrying a black shoulder bag.  Don't be shy about tapping me on the shoulder to say hi."

169226,TJQ,2008-03-09 17:17:00,7806,I will likely be wandering around all day Saturday.  I've never been before... always went to the fishing show.  Is there anywhere where we could schedule a time for OFC'rs to gather and have a ... um beverage??  Maybe we could put an evening together as well.

169241,blizzcat,2008-03-09 18:15:00,92,oh!! thanks for the reminder! i almost forgot it was this weekend..
169253,LundGuy,2008-03-09 18:59:00,169,"Will be there on Saturday with my bother-in-law and son. I have been going every year since the late sixties. It was fabulous back then, could make deals on everything. Always came home with new equipment or a new boat ( wife used to warn me each year,not to come home if I even thought about a new boat)  .Things changed over the years and the Tackle shops became less and less and did not barter much. Grimsby tackle still does. I heard this year was going to be more like the past, we will see."
169255,lew,2008-03-09 19:04:00,12767,Wednesday for me.
169258,fishindevil,2008-03-09 19:06:00,6254,"Hey lew i might be going on wednesday myself,if i do i will pm you and we could meet up,and take it all in !!!!  cheers"
169260,lew,2008-03-09 19:10:00,12767,"Sounds good Shawn, I'll be there when the doors open Wednesday morning.  I'll be smilin all day too, I'm picking up a Shimano TE400 & another  musky pole"
169263,fishindevil,2008-03-09 19:16:00,6254,"Those tekotas are a great reel,for the money there is none better  ,my charter fishing buddy bought 10 of them a few years ago,and they all work amazing even with wire line,the drag system is second to none,they can handle a salmon doing a 300yrd run at 20mph,with ease,good choice lew....those muskies better watch out !!!!!"
169264,lew,2008-03-09 19:20:00,12767,"Actually Shawn, the TE400 is a Calcutta casting reel, but your right about the Tekota's, their also an incredible reel and I use one myself for trolling."
169317,BFSC Kevin,2008-03-09 22:10:00,1351,the tekotas are on special at LB for $150 i think i might be heading there on wednesday myself..!
169333,Toronto_Angler,2008-03-09 22:53:00,698,I'll be there sunday

169347,Loonietoon,2008-03-09 23:23:00,1450,I'll be there on Saturday all day At the Fishinontario Booth... Yea I know some off you think they are crooks but if you know them they are great people.. stop in and find me and I will try to help you out.. Just ask Gerritt... He likes to shop with me there
169392,BillM,2008-03-10 01:35:00,17367," Sounds like my game plan, I'll be there on Wednesday also.  Lew, can you barter with the vendors much?  I was looking into a 8' Shimano Compre for my muskie rod, but if I can save some $$$ on something better perhaps a St.Croix Avid?"
169394,kickingfrog,2008-03-10 01:38:00,8333,"I think Friday is my day. All the fun stuff (fun for me, dull, dull, dull for my wife) in the afternoon, and then I'll meet my wife and see everything else in the evening."
169439,walleyemen,2008-03-10 03:11:00,316,"BillM try yhe Grimsby tackle booth, i just purchased a st. croix trimph rod, 7' med heavy for $59.99 no tax, they were packing up that day for the show, i believe they have the no tax thing going as well, tax from $200 sure make for upgrading to something better."
169475,Cory,2008-03-10 10:07:00,170,"TJ, If we show up please remember to keep the 30 meters distance in the court order....  just smile and wave"
169476,lew,2008-03-10 11:00:00,12767," Bill, your making a good choice with the Compre, it's an excellent musky rod & comes with a lifetime warranty too. I've got a couple myself and IMHO, they're every bit as good as my St. Croix rods.  As for the bartering, yup, you can often work some nice deals with a few of the vendors."
169477,tinbanger,2008-03-10 11:16:00,1028,"Thursday for me and the gang!  Vendors will bargain , often throw in some freebies , shirt , line and the like  TB"
169493,David Chong,2008-03-10 12:52:00,836,"I will be in the Daiwa booth on Wed. & Thurs. I will also be in the Lakeport-WFN ""HOT SEAT"" at 3:40PM on Wed. Look forward to seeing anyone who might drop in! Cheers, Dave"
169542,maybe,2008-03-10 15:02:00,307,"I'll be there by myself on Wed, likely from 11am or noon til closing.  Planning on catching 4 seminars at the Fish TV Zone.  At 1pm it's walleye, then from 4-6pm it's trolling motors, general bait tricks, and largemouths.  Will be back on Sat with Hubby, likely arriving 2-2:30pm and staying til closing.  We'll split up to see the smallmouth and crankbait seminars at 4, and then both be at the muskie seminar at 5 and Italo's multi-species at 6.  Would love to put some faces to the names here.  If anything's going on for Wed/Sat, please keep me in the loop."
169568,huntervasili,2008-03-10 16:42:00,1604,I am thinking so we all know who is who we should cut out boxes and put some string on them and hang a piece on the front and on the back saying OFC and then your Handle... Here's what I mean... of course this is a little bit smaller of a sign than I was looking for this is what he had already made. See you there  Ohh and I know I am not so great with photoshop lol  
169570,BillM,2008-03-10 16:49:00,17367,"Everyone needs a  ""Hello my name is ______________""  sticker"
