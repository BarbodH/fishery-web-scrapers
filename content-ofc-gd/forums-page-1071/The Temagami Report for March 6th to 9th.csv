169705,Roy,2008-03-10 22:25:00,13728,Thanks for the report Wayne. Some really nice pics in there too. You're fortunate to be able to get away like that from time to time.

169739,lew,2008-03-10 23:24:00,12767,"Good stuff  Wayne and definetely better to be playing in the snow, rather that shovelling it all weekend like most of us"
169741,Clampet,2008-03-10 23:27:00,1947,"A big thanks, Irish, for yet another glimpse into what I wish I could also do.  It goes to show that fishing can be pretty tough even on these seldom fished remote lakes."
169752,Tomcat,2008-03-10 23:42:00,395,Thanks for sharing the story and the pics.
169772,fishindevil,2008-03-11 00:00:00,6254,"Nice fishing trip/report wayne !!!!.  ..too bad about loosing a few days being sick,but at least you got to go sledding and hit a few new lakes to explore later on,  and it must have been cool to meet up with all those guys and go ripping around on all those nice machines !!!! better luck next time...cheers"
