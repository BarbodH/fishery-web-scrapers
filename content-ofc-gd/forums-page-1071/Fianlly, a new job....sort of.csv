I got the news the day before the Tyler event and have spent the last two weeks studying and taking my 9 day requalification course.  Thursday afternoon I was given my certificate and it's now official.  Starting Monday, if any of you have occasion to use the Yonge/University/Spadina line, ya just never know who might be bounching you around or closing the doors on you  This change will take at least 30-45 minutes off my commute each way    along with about 60km/day shorter, should save me a bit of money.  No more fighting with the traffic, worrying about the weather, oh it's going to be so nice to be underground  .  I will miss the customers I met while at Wheel Trans, but I really needed the change.  So now that the stress of tests is over, I can focus on sending out the auction items and start thinking about what I'm going to do with my boat  Maureen"
168786,ChrisK,2008-03-08 12:25:00,2772,"Mo, Main thing is your happy with the move and 45 minutes closer to the kids I'll be looking for a driving job as well after the plant closes in July. Going back to the Otario Driving School for my ""C""...Got a DZ right now but I would really like to drive a Greyhound eventually. Around here you got to wait until someone retires and the line up for this job is pretty big but I got nothing but time.  Cheers !!!"
168788,Sandbag,2008-03-08 12:32:00,533,Congrats Maureen  Can't beat a shorter commute these days.  Every day there seems to be more traffic.  I commute to Oakville every day from Niagara.  I've been doing it for about ten years.  I can't believe how much the traffic has increased towards Niagara over those ten years.  Enjoy  Cheers  Craig
168789,Roy,2008-03-08 12:36:00,13728,"Congrats to you Maureen. Personally, I think it's a conspiracy. The TTC just doesn't want you steering anything.  Glad you came through this so well."
168816,Fisherman,2008-03-08 13:42:00,7201,"Congrats, don't stop now, life a a learning curve, just have to figure out how to make a straight line of it.  45 minutes off the commute, more time in the boat."

168844,Tdel,2008-03-08 14:59:00,393,"Congratulations Maureen.  I cringe everytime I find out I have to go to Toronto.  With your new job you shouldn't have to worry all day long about the crazy drivers down there doing the unexpected, until you are going to and from work.  Tom."

169666,bpsbassman,2008-03-10 21:19:00,941,"Congrats Maureen! Does that make you a ""Train Engineer""??"

I've been working shifts for a few years now Cliff, I won't get the hours I was getting but I'll do ok, starting April I'll be working from 10:30am to 6:30pm, not too bad with my measly seniority ...oh and I'll have Tues/Wed off, so I can be on the water when everyone else is at work  Maureen"
