163562,Cookslav,2008-02-23 21:44:00,1457,"My Brothers out there...went to Grande Prarie(were Kyle is) As a 2nd year Welding apprentice for almost double what he was getting per hour in Ontario. Only 3 months laters jumped ship to another contractor for $3 more/hour plus a company phone. 4 months later the same company sent him to Calgary...and added another $2/hour to his pay along with a company truck, and they slotted him into this past fall season of School.  He's gonna be licenced shortly, and has a tough decision to make....stay, or come home licensed. His origional plan was to go out there, pay off some debts, come home with his license, get married, start a family.  Now he's questioning the leaving part. Jobs in Ontario are not plenty, and not as rewarding... Family and freinds are here, but the moneys there...tough decision for sure."
163621,KyleM,2008-02-23 23:49:00,218,"Grande Prairie isnt much to look at but a little over an hours drive puts you into the Northern Rockies near Grande Cache.  To the north I have Great Slave Lake which is a 6-7 hour drive....Dont forget the thousands of back lakes that see no more then a few fisherman a year.  Jasper is a few hours away.........amazing Kokanee Salmon, Rainbow fishing on the head waters of the Fraiser River.  The Yukon is do-able.  Grande Cache is known for its spectacular Bull Trout fishing, the view from the rivers look like theyre taken from a magazine.    Was a no brainer for me! "

Lots of tough nuts out West so you can easily be led astray.  What I would do first is find out where you want to go.  You need a place to lay your head, or go back to if you are doing the camp thing.  Housing is really tough to find.  Once you have an Idea where you are going, secure a job before departing Ontario.  People are begging for workers so that company may set you up for an Apprenticeship.  Probably the best Apprenticeship program in the country.  Paid schooling is also involved.  Now here are the Benefits, lots of money to be made, as a young fellow you have the chance to move up the ladder extremely fast.  As a young tradesman you have an excellent chance to own some of your equipment, have a decent truck, and then go into your own business leasing your self to the Oil and Gas Industry making huge amount of cash.  Find a good woman, buy a good house in a small town, work your arse off, and you may find yourself way ahead than in Ont a few years down the Road.  By the way, if things don't work out, move to Sask like all the Albertans are doing now.  Sask is opening the Tar sands, Mining is Booming, and to the south of here, parts of USA and Saskatchewan are going to exploit one of the biggest deposits of oil in North America along the Fault line.  The future here says, Ont will slow down, the West will not.  But do your Homework as you will not regret.  What can hurt, you will gain an experience at the minimal."

164123,holdfast,2008-02-25 02:47:00,1813,"http://www.jobbank.gc.ca/Intro_en.aspx http://www.saskjobs.ca/   Couple of Links just to get you perking.  What I did was found out what area I wanted to go to, checked the MLS, then changed my mind from AB to SK.  I phoned a couple of Companies, got interested in one.  I then asked them about housing, Map Recced good fishing areas, and then moved the family.  I am lucky though, I bought 2006 for 104,000 and now its worth 240,000.  Sask is getting crazy because Albertas cost of living is bringing back all the Sasktonians that had once left the province.  DO YOUR HOMEWORK"

So all in all it worked out itself! Thanks for all your help guys."
169541,mepps,2008-03-10 15:01:00,1301,Go for it!  It's harder to do things like that when you get older!
169552,superdad,2008-03-10 15:38:00,353,Remember Alberta has 800 lakes - so there's a considerable amount of fishing pressure on those resources.  It's the land of milk and no taxes - but everything comes with a price.  Your age will allow to relocate should you find it not to your liking.  Lotsa Luck  David  aka  Superdad
