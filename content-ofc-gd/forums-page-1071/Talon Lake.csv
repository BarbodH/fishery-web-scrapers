Have caught quite a few walleye here.  There are some good numbers of Muskie in there and Pike and Bass are in abundance.I have been told there are some lake trout too.  You want to be on the lake early before the pleasure boaters get up and zoom around there are many cottages on this lake .  you will like this Lake very nice place .Have a good time.Mike
