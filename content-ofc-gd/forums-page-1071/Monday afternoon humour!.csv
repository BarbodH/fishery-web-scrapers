169612,Headhunter,2008-03-10 19:09:00,5703,"A Florida senior citizen drove his brand new BMW convertible out of the dealership. Taking off down the road, he pushed it to 80 mph, enjoying the wind blowing through his sparse hair.  Amazing, he thought as he flew down I-75, pushing the pedal even more.  But, looking in his rear view mirror, he saw the State Trooper behind him, blue lights flashing and siren blaring. He floored it to 100 mph, then 110, then 120.  Suddenly he thought, 'What am I doing? I'm too old for this,' and pulled over to await the Trooper's arrival.  Pulling in behind him, the Trooper walked up to the BMW, looked at his watch and said, 'Sir, my shift ends in 30 minutes. Today is Friday. If you can give me a reason for speeding that I've never heard before, I'll let you go.  The old gentleman paused. Then said, 'Three years ago, my wife ran off with a Florida State Trooper. I thought you were bringing her back.'   Have a good day, Sir,' replied the trooper. HH"
