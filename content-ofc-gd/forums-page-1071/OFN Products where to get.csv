165857,2 tone z71,2008-02-29 04:34:00,1311,Wolf yah those rulers dont cut it when your Muskie fishing
165872,waterwolf,2008-02-29 06:03:00,556,"you're right over 48 would be a shame to boat and not have an accurate measurement . different pond ,, those subs come in big. good luck and hope the larger tape is required this summer."
165935,BillM,2008-02-29 14:39:00,17367,Ohhh.. I think the oldmans boat needs some OFC stickers...
169584,2 tone z71,2008-03-10 17:16:00,1311,got it Today thanks TJ great stuff man
169586,douG,2008-03-10 17:29:00,2693,"To use a short ruler for a long fish, just cut it off at the 48 in mark, then measure the next 4ft piece, and repeat as needed.  Hope this hleps."
169635,Terry,2008-03-10 19:50:00,14456,ah..yeah that would work..!!
169782,camillj,2008-03-11 00:18:00,1988,"Just a suggestion ... do it at the 20"" mark ... that way the math is ALOT easier ... and I suspect 68"" is more than most of will need to be concerned about"
169815,Mike the Pike,2008-03-11 00:53:00,3421,TJ I guess you have alot of the old stock remaining will you be making some new items available in the near future .  Items that are written OFNCOMMUNITY.COM  So is it in the plans?
169827,Roy,2008-03-11 01:08:00,13728,"No Mike, there are no immediate plans for OFC apparel. OFC and OFC though closely tied are distinct and separate entities. Ideas are always welcomed, however."
