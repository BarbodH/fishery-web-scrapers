If we don't take this ""Due diligence"" in these cases, the company and not the credit card company is on the hook for the loss and they do try to prove it's our fault."
170418,Pinch,2008-03-12 17:46:00,231," Did she ask to see any other card after you signed it to compare the signatures?  If not I always wonder what the point is!  Sort of a half hearted attempt really....kinda like when I went to Disneyland last year, they searched everyones bags, but no ones pockets and no metal detectors!  Why bother!"
169730,lew,2008-03-10 23:10:00,12767,I made a purchase in RONA's the other day with a VISA card and the cashier noticed my signature had worn off and asked me to sign it again before she would accept it.
169756,huey graphite,2008-03-10 23:44:00,362,  I've got a solution for you. Whenever my wife goes on a shopping trip.....I just call and report my cards stolen.
169793,camillj,2008-03-11 00:32:00,1988,Good topic ...  I have at least a dozen times been standing in line behind someone taking a fit on the cashier for not asking for photo id - when it clearly says to do so on the back of their card .... I have NEVER heard a cashier ask for photo id (except for mine) - because my card is ALWAYS impossible to read after about a week ... either way I have yet to see someone be refused service - Id say the consumer is much better protected than the bank or the store in this instance so you can probably rest easy either way - but stay vigilant on your statements so you can mitigate the damages is something unpleasant does happen to you.
169799,LeXXington,2008-03-11 00:38:00,1928,"My favorite is when you go too a store, They take your card say its not signed... Ask you to sign it, never ask for other ID then compare the signatures to make sure they match the bill.  Now thats closing the barn door after the cows escaped"

If I'm not careful, irritating it can knock out the fine motor control in my right hand - and I'm right handed.  Let's just say my signature doesn't always look like what's on my cards.  Never had a clerk so much as raise an eyebrow when I'm having a bad hand day.  They do seem to perk up if I forget to sign a new card, though.  At the end of the day, I just put my faith in the cardholder protection clauses, and get on with it."
169890,Vanselena,2008-03-11 03:33:00,269,"On the back of my cards I write ""See Drivers License"" I have been asked many times even at the bank. If you do this then make sure you have taken a photo to document it."
