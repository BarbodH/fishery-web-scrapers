Currently on the boat is the 83/200hz beams which is really nice.  My dad and I do quite a bit of shore busting and the side view would really help with those sneaky bass underneath the docks/boat houses.  Anyone have anything good or bad to say?  Transducers are pretty cheap, around $70US or so..."
169977,Greencoachdog,2008-03-11 15:26:00,8163,I have the 747c as well and will be installing the quadrabeam transducer in a week or two. I'm going to install it with the optional splitter so I can keep the dualbeam hooked up for deeper water and switch to the quadrabeam for shallow water. I'll let you know how it goes.
