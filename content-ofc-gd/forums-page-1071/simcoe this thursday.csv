Looking for some advice regarding access and parking, we are heading up from Richmond Hill, so south end would be best. We will be walking out and all I have is a hand auger.....so hoping to find some open holes already (or maybe come across some friendly OFC'rs with gas augers). Any suggestions are greatly appreciated. Thanks everyone."
