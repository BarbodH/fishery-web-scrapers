It was a last minute thing as I was supposed to be busy this weekend,  but thankfully the wifey is letting me get away.  Man I love her.  This will probably cost me BIG TIME though!!!!  So anyways I was just curious as to if anyone has been up this week and could tell me what to expect.  Should be a good time and the fish will be a bonus.  Leaving at noon tomorrow so any help is greatly appreciated.  Thanks  Brian"

168377,Bernie,2008-03-07 04:03:00,3190,Hello Brian. I don't think too many here have fished the Bay lately. I fish the south end of the lake but usually in the summer. I have heard of a few guys starting to catch them again. But it has been really slow on the lake.

Only managed two pickeral, they were hitting super light.  Anyways we all had a blast and will do it again next year.  Later  Brian"
