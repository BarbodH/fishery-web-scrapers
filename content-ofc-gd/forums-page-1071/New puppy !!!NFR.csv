169480,Spiel,2008-03-10 11:50:00,9065,....Great looking dog Chris. Hope you're bringing him up to Lakair.
169509,Rattletrap2,2008-03-10 13:40:00,1652,"WTG Chris! He is adorable! I have an older, larger version of him at home. Looks like Lab / Border Collie cross? They are very intelligent dogs and make the best of pets. You have done a good thing by bringing him home.  Ours loves the snow. As soon as he gets out there in the yard, he immediately buries his head under the snow and tosses his head in the air!  Enjoy your new bud!"
169512,TJQ,2008-03-10 13:48:00,7806,Good for you bud.. hes pretty cute!

Aug 9 I will be returning to Lakair with Carol and my folks and...........Arnie and Sam,the dynamic dual !!!! Arnie will have to teach Sam proper boat edicate...Wait till dad catches fish and sets it on the bottom of the boat and then lick the fish and bark like hell!!!!  Chris"
168758,ChrisK,2008-03-08 05:01:00,2772,"About three weeks ago Carol and I adopted a puppy from a good friend of mine. He was one out of ten pups in the litter. The rest of the pups were adopted first but he was left behind,unwanted by all who came and you will never guess why.....He's blind in one eye.He was born with a condition that occured in mothers womb that stops the retina development in the prestages. Carol and I couldn't help ourselves... We took him home and named him Samson because of his strength and courage.......Here are a couple before and after shots so far.      Here's mom   Now he's about 25 pounds and still growing !!!! Pics to come.....  Cheers !!!"
