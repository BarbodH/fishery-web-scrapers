Well thats about it, had fun here met some really nice people. but lately not really impressed."

170467,fishinggeek,2008-03-12 19:30:00,325,At least they have a dedicated audience relations email address.  I'm going to write them and suggest they put only the best fishing shows on 24 hours a day so I can stop paying extra for WFN!
