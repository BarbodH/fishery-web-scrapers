If they become blocked by the snow they can cause carbon monoxide poisoning, they all have safeties in place, but stay on the side of caution and keep them clear as well as your meter!  Take care guys Denis"

169239,Rattletrap2,2008-03-09 18:11:00,1652,"Thanks for the reminder! Of course, I should know this, but totally forgot about the meter. It sits really low and the regulator vent could get blocked."

169412,Tinman,2008-03-10 02:10:00,376,"nope, not the meter, but if it gets water in it and freezes, it could crack, causing a gas leak"

169996,Tinman,2008-03-11 17:05:00,376,Just a reminder with the snow coming in the ottawa area again to keep those vents and meters clear! Apparently there were a few visits (20 something) to the local hospitals and many calls to the local fire department.
