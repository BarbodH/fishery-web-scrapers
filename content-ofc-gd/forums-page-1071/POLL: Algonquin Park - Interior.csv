168550,Stoty,2008-03-07 19:23:00,2910,"Thanks for the input so far everyone.  Just a shame its not making my decision any easier, being tied 3, 3, 3! hahaha"
168552,dannyboy,2008-03-07 19:58:00,367,"Any spot in Algonquin is great, there are fish everywhere. Pick a spot, make your plans and enjoy. We alway find ourselves making plans for our next trip on the way home from the last one.  Dan"
168803,Stoty,2008-03-08 13:23:00,2910," Thats soo true Dan! Heck, since I cant make up my mind which spot to go, I am planning my next trip, before I take this trip! hahaha."
168813,solopaddler,2008-03-08 13:34:00,8605,"Between the 3 you listed Farm, Booth and Crotch for sure. Beautiful area with the added bonus of big pike."
168836,Stoty,2008-03-08 14:41:00,2910,Big Pike are always welcomed on my line! Thanks for the input!
168972,fishindevil,2008-03-08 22:08:00,6254,"Yes crotch lake has produced some very big pike for the size of the lake,my friend fishes there in the summer and i have seen some pike close to 20lbs,  it would be my choice for sure,and catch & release keeps them getting bigger and bigger as he and his dad have fished there for over 40yrs,and when his dad first started there they never got a pike for over 10lbs or so !!!!   so its proof that letting the big ones go pays off,so good luck in your choice as they are alll very good fish holding bueatifull shield lakes !!!!!....cheers"
168974,Stoty,2008-03-08 22:10:00,2910,"wow, thats awesome. thanks again for your input! much appreciated!"
169029,ehg,2008-03-09 01:25:00,2666,"Voted for Shall/ Booth/Farm etc.. Good bass fishing, some pike there and trout in Booth. Can even access Opeongo through Booth.  Smoke/Ragged etc is good for bass with brookies in S. Porcupine.  The best Algonquin fishing has to be Petawawa R. from L.Travers to McManus however. Non- stop smallies, channel cats, even chance at walleye and musky.  Hope that hleps,  ehg"
