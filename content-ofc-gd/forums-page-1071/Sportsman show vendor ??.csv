169516,Alumacraft,2008-03-10 14:21:00,139,I am trying too find the name of the hydrographic map vendor that's at the show every year.I just went through the vendor list on the shows  website and could not find anything. I need a hydrogaphic map of Nosbonsing lake and if the map vendor is not there this year there's not much point of me going. I hope I missed them under the vendors list. Thanks Rob

If not just go to the Canadian Hydrographic Services site and you can order it there. You will just have to do some searching as the site is not user friendly.  I will check when I am home tonight to see if i can find the card.  Mike"
