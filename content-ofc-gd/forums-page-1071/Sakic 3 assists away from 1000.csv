Hit the scorboard up for 3 points tonight   A gentleman for the ages and a true captain not only for his team but our country.  Cheers to Joe Sakic.    Not only a natural role model for kids but for all of us as men.     hahaha I know I am laying on thick but I have been watching this guy since I was young along with Steve Yzerman.    2 of my favourite players.   alot said from a die hard leaf fan.  So ""here here""   for ole burnaby Joe"
