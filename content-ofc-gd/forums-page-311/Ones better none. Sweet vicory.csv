784474,misfish,2013-05-05 16:56:00,29133,"It,s been a long dry spell for me this spring.The last fish I caught was a 2 pound rainbow back in early March. Not sure if I was doing something wrong,or I just didnt adapted to the weird weather we have been having. Blown rivers,high waters,cold for a week,then the +20 temps for a week. I,ll tell ya,I was getting depressed. Well not really,but it was getting frustrating. Yesterday I was out on the Notty (told there was lots of fish) HAHAHAHAHAHA,get yer turkey yet bud?  Atleast I got my feed a fiddel heads.    So for todays outing,Im trying to decide,what,where,how,to fish  Do I hit the notty for one more try,or do I go with the fly and streams? Well I decided to give the notty a try. I went,I saw,and after a couple of hours,I left. It,s only 7:30 plenty of time to try another spot. I had my 5 wt in the trunk,so headed to a nice stream.  As Im walking down to it,the bugs are crazy. In my ears,up my nose,in my eyes. Then it dawned on me,,,,,,,,,,,,,theres a hatch going on.SWEET.  I watch to see what they are. They look like black flys,but their not. Then I see a few larger ones,and get an idea of what I can try.  Not sure if you can see them flying around.      So I start throwing this little fly for about 10 minutes,with nothing to show. I was really watching the water for action,but there was no fish surfacing. Then it happen,yup,back swing,and catch me a nice tall pine.   Pull and I lose it.  I remember a post  about late spring fishing,and it felt like it was today,with the warm weather and the water wasnt really that cold. So I go through my inventory and find me a #14 halgimiight.(sp)  I try a nice ripple area that goes into a nice pool. First swing,lands just nice. It makes it way down and hits the slack water WHAM. I lift,and the short fight is on. A few nice jumps and it was on the bank.  PB on a fly. A nice resident rainbow.Quick pic,and off he was, back to his play ground.       Long post for a small fish,but I havent made a fishing related post in sometime.  OH WHAT A RELIEF IT IS.  My names not Terry any more."
