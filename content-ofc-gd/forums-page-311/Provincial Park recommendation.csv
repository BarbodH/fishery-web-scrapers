784106,mirogak,2013-05-03 03:04:00,387,Specks in Frontenac? Get outta here!
784107,mirogak,2013-05-03 03:06:00,387,"Go Algonquin Park. Hit Tea lake, Cannisbay or Kearney lake campgrounds. AP is the best."
784112,HTHM,2013-05-03 03:28:00,4082,"Consider the Bruce National Park, the Grotto will take your kids breath away."
784133,Musky or Specks,2013-05-03 10:59:00,2710,"I'm going to say Arrowhead. It was my favourite PP as a kid. Natural waterslide, three beaches and most importantly for kids. Lots of other kids to play with. Huntsville is 5 minutes away so the wife can go to town to break up the wilderness experience. My fondest memories growing up are my 2 weeks spent there every summer."
784151,torco,2013-05-03 13:03:00,656,A little further is Halfway Lake or Restoule....But can't go wrong with Algonquin or Arrowhead
784160,bow slayer,2013-05-03 13:48:00,1074,"right at about 4 hours for you is Restoule,quiet park,good hiking trails,bike trails,park has 2 beaches,,can access Stormy lake from the park to give you a more secluded remote experience,park and lake has little traffic compared to others farther south. The fishing is great for walleye,smallies,musky,lakers and pike.Excellent waterfront sites also. North bay only 40 minutes away for day trips.Amazing scenery.  Another is Bonnechere PP near Pembroke,again will be 4 hours for you,but great park with an awesome beach. Has a ton of great waterfront sites and fishing is good for bass,pike and walleye. When we went we did a day trip to Ottawa and Hull and also did a day of whitewater rafting.Again amazing scenery.  If you want anymore info on either just ask,I have also been to Bon Echo and Sharbot Lake both are nice and have great features as well.  Some of the parks farther south such as balsam,six mile,emily  and south  Algonquin are nice but very busy and lots of boat traffic,if you want a quieter more relaxed setting the others will offer more of that."
784180,Old Ironmaker,2013-05-03 15:19:00,8243,"Do you have a back up plan? Don't get too upset if they don't share your vision or passion for camping. I never liked it, my idea of roughing it is a Holiday Inn Express. The last few times I tried, and I've tried more than a few times, I stayed at a motel and went back to the campsite every morning after a soak in the spa and a breakfast served to me on real plates with silverware.  When I have to hang my food from a tree so the bears don't get to it I'm outta there. I asked my girlfriend at the time, how in the hell did the bear get out of the zoo?"
784197,SylvanOwner,2013-05-03 16:27:00,266,I don't think you'll find the trails very inspiring at Balsam but the beach is pretty good although usually very busy.
784354,fishing n autograph,2013-05-04 18:52:00,2540,"Hey guys, thanks for all the help. My wife and I have decided on algonquin"
784359,ketchenany,2013-05-04 19:34:00,3229,"Good choice Dave I've been there. We advertise a lot about Ontario's parks in our Ontario Travel Magazine but don't get into details about noise  . . .  We let the comsumer decide on what they need.  My wife and kids wanted to try it many years back and we bought tent, sleeping bags. . . Only used once, they like Yorkdale better lol."
784360,fishing n autograph,2013-05-04 19:37:00,2540,I loved Algonquin when I was there many years ago. I've been able to get my wife into baseball and a few other things and she really wants to try camping
784364,muskymatt,2013-05-04 20:08:00,2608,"Murphys point PP has everything a family would want. If you're considering Silver lake then the Big Rideau is not much further. Very nice, did 7 years there when my kids were young.  Quiet, private(depending on which site you get), lots to do and good fishing"
783994,fishing n autograph,2013-05-02 18:48:00,2540,"Hey All,  I want to take my wife and kids camping for the first time. I grew up outdoors and loved camping but my wife and kids aren't exactly the outdoorsy types lol.  Can anyone suggest a good place for first timers?  I'm looking for a place where I'm not going to run into partying teenagers etc  Thanks in advance!  Dave"
783996,torco,2013-05-02 18:56:00,656,"depends on what you are looking for but the parks tend to get more wilderness like the further north you go. How far do you want to travel, what are you looking for outside of a non party place?"
784000,fishing n autograph,2013-05-02 19:02:00,2540,"Well I'm not worried about driving too far. Within 3-4 hours I kitchener-Waterloo.  I'm not too picky about emenities. A place for the kids to swim, hiking trails, some privacy would be nice"
784001,davew3,2013-05-02 19:06:00,430,You could try Silver Lake on HWY 7 east of Marmora.   Or Sharbot Lake out that way.
784002,Cast-Away,2013-05-02 19:07:00,790,Awenda in Penatang is quite nice with larger sites and a great beach. The beach is a 15 minute walk from the parking lot.
784003,fishing n autograph,2013-05-02 19:16:00,2540,Has anyone camped at craigleith or earl Rowe!
784005,BillM,2013-05-02 19:28:00,17367,"Oastler Lake in Parry Sound was nice when I was there a few years ago.  Same with Six Mile, but it's a lot busier."
784006,SirCranksalot,2013-05-02 19:34:00,3291,"Killbear is one of the best but may be booked up already---has good swimming, hiking, some massive big hunks of Cdn shield. And can nip over to Dillon, rent a boat, and go fishing."
784009,Rod Caster,2013-05-02 19:38:00,5784,"Mikisew in South RIver is perfect for kids! We went there many times growing up. Also, great fishing for Daddy!"
784028,SylvanOwner,2013-05-02 21:27:00,266,"Has anyone camped at craigleith or earl Rowe! Earl Rowe isn't very nice as far as provincial parks go.  The river is small and just won't do justice to the camping experience, IMO.  Craigleith would be much better I think.  Most of the other suggestions are good as well (in no particular order); Six Mile, Oastler, Killbear, Awenda, Bruce Peninsula National Park will all give you a solid camping experience.  Hope the family enjoys whatever you decide on."
784040,irishfield,2013-05-02 21:55:00,26272,You could go all the way to Temagami Dave... nice sand beach for the kids and the choice between no power and power sites in two areas of the park. Pending what you want.... and you choose to head that way... I can recommend the best sites depending on what you want as a site and how close to the comfort station or just a privy that you require.
784046,spincast,2013-05-02 22:14:00,3279,"Bon Echo; hardwood hills campground. do the hike into Joe Perry for a of day fishing, or head to the group campsite lake."
784049,woodenboater,2013-05-02 22:30:00,2277,"Never camped at Craigleith myself but friends have and now avoid the place like the plaque. Noisy campers is all she remembers. ymmv.  +1 on Oastler, Awenda and Killbear. Although it's on the edge of your driving circle, I'd look into Arrowhead. Haven't camped there but from my winter visits there, it looks alike a nice campground and it's close to Huntsville if the family needs a break"
784054,fishing n autograph,2013-05-02 22:44:00,2540,"I'm thinking Balsam lake, Wheatley or algonquin"
784055,irishfield,2013-05-02 22:49:00,26272,Lake of Two Rivers... has a nice swim beach Dave.
784057,cram,2013-05-02 22:53:00,1733,"Algonquin would be far more ""camping experience"" than Balsam.I don't know Wheatley.  Restoule is nice, though a little further than 3-4 hrs from where you are.  Have heard good things about Massasauga, though I have never been."
784058,Fisherman,2013-05-02 22:57:00,7201,"I'd avoid Craigleith also,  if you want to be a sardine for the weekend, that's the place to be.  Along with being situated right along highway 26, no thanks."
784060,woodenboater,2013-05-02 23:08:00,2277,"If you go to Algonquin, my suggestion would be to pass on Rock Lake. It has some great attributes but there are enough noisy campers to make it very annoying. Mew or Two Rivers would be  good choices (more so Mew) although Two Rivers is very wide open with pretty well zero privacy."
784061,irishfield,2013-05-02 23:11:00,26272,VERY True... unless you can get a site along the river.
784062,Terry,2013-05-02 23:24:00,14456,"balsam is nice,,,,,well it was the last time I stayed there  10 or so years ago  there are lots of trails  a nice sand beach    canoe rentals and fishing  book early to get a good site"
784063,SirCranksalot,2013-05-02 23:24:00,3291,Avoid Balsam if you don't like noise!
784068,irishfield,2013-05-02 23:51:00,26272,The campground past the Mews and Lake of Two Rivers campgrounds has a radio free zone.. can't remember it's name but it's at the East end of Lake of Two Rivers.
784069,woodenboater,2013-05-03 00:04:00,2277,Mew has a radio free as well although not sure how well that works out as sound just shoots across the lake/pond. I think the size of Mew and the fact that it's beside the highway make it seem less desirable. I really like it and it has access to several trails in close proximity and a field full of blueberries just waiting to be picked...  and there's the 'waterfall/rapids' on the Madawaska that makes for nice summer lounging
784071,irishfield,2013-05-03 00:14:00,26272,Yep... we've walked the trail from Mews to what ever the other campground is down the East end of the lake.. and it's a little further in on hwy 60 than Mews and Lake of 2 Rivers so should be quieter.  Just wish we could still fly in there... considering the area East of the Mews was a runway through the 60's /70's and caused less noise than the 10's of thousands of cars on hwy 60 !
784098,Moosebunk,2013-05-03 02:04:00,3970,"Frontenac Park is a great scenic spot too.  Lake trout, speckle and bass fishing opportunites."
