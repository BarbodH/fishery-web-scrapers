784066,mr blizzard,2013-05-02 23:38:00,1589,"Just a heads up, my 86 year old mother was involved in a serious collision yesterday just outside of Woodbridge Ont just north of TO.  The car was a write off, fortunately she survived  and is being held for observation for a couple of days,,,and she was not at fault either, just difficult being this far away when something like that happens. (but she is a tough old farm girl from TJs neck of the woods)  She has always had the philosophy that the cup is half full not half empty, carrying on that tradition I decided to go out on the ice for a bit of quiet time after digesting the news and drop a line and try my luck at fishing, being thankful for what I still have.  Well it took 2 years to write a poem so I could use that to propose to my wife, believe me I am not the artsy type, but this came to mind while getting a tug on the line yesterday, I actually ad libbed my wife's poem,,,,here goes hope u enjoy  Roses are red Violets are blue My little cleo was silver and blue Your surface was like rubies Your hooks were like sapphires You always presented yourself In the greatest attires Your character was like that of the Maple Leafs You were always persistent Regardless of the disbeliefs We had a 6 year relationship Which started at the CTC Barrie south store Today was your day, today was game on You faced that BEAST like an Alice Cooper rock song You fought a tough battle You did your job well But the line that tied us together Did not fare so well The raveges of the teeth were too much to bare, The reel was smokin He dragged you away without a care And with a sinking heart All I could do was look down the hole and stare But no worries my friend Theres more fishing days ahead Maybe  I will catch him again someday And you'll be back in the old homestead Compartment number three Right beside the glowing jig head  LOL  Hope it made someones day, and made you laugh anybody else lost a favourite piece of tackle  Blizz "

This was real and I was hoping it would inspire some others to see the positive side of life and maybe count their blessings. But maybe to some those things are not important anymore"

784271,mr blizzard,2013-05-04 00:11:00,1589,"Thanks, when I saw where u live I thought that was pretty cool. The family dates back in the Woodbridge area since the latter 1800s, one of the original homesteaders, I have old old pics from my mom of the area that would blow your mind away. When growing up we only had one policeman in town and he went home at 6pm.  If u needed assistance after hours  you had to go to his home.  The only time he used his red light was for the Santa Claus parade, sometimes he had to tap it to make it work. When he had a day off the Maple Police filled in . I will have to give u a call sometime,  She should be out of the hospital Sunday, thanks again for your thoughts, really appreciated."
784310,Old Ironmaker,2013-05-04 05:40:00,8243,"Sorry to hear about you mom, it can be tough being far from someone that you need to be with. I can tell you He made those folks from the 20's as tough as iron. I got a call 2 weeks ago from a very close dear friend telling me his 92 year old dad was in intensive care in Hamilton. The priest had been in to see him and Dominic and the family was staying at his bedside around the clock.  Tonight I sat with that tough old nut at a stag party for his future grandson and had a glass of wine with him!!!!!!!!!! 2 weeks ago he was on his death bed. He told me that he saw St. Peter and was told to get his ass back home because his grand daughter was getting married in a few months and momma needed a date.  Chin up bro, she's going to be fine."
784313,ketchenany,2013-05-04 10:57:00,3229,"I'll kee an eye out for her if she is out jogging! I've been here 20 years and love the place. The surrounding forests the two Humber rivers at gorgeous, the odd log cabin adds character. If you remember the one on Clarence, by the river, they took that down  I tink they moved it. If you ever come down would love to chat. Scan those pictures and make copies, they are valuable.  Albert  If you ver come down"
784336,Joey,2013-05-04 13:55:00,9122,"Sorry about your mom, glad she is okay.  Loved the poem"
784349,mr blizzard,2013-05-04 17:00:00,1589,"Thanks Old Ironmaker, so happy to hear about your friends recovery, thanks for the kind words, I'll tell that story to my mom tonight, that will cheer her up, she should be home tommorow, I can tell she is feeling better, she is complaining about the hospital food LOL  Thanks again, we lived in the house beside the laneway on Clarence north side, dad built the house, he was born across the road where the golf course is, his mom was born and lived in a house at the very base of old church st and his moms mom was born and raised in a small home at the base of the hill that leads up to the fairgrounds, Dad had 5 acres and 5 cabins on the property where the house stands, people used to come up from Toronto and rent them on the weekends,   after the hurricane came thru the govt took 4.5 acres away to realign the river,    sadly mom had to sell the house last fall after being in it for almost 67 years, but fortunately she has moved in with my sister just a couple of miles up on clarence, all the spruce trees were planted by dad after the hurricane,  ironically a few were taken out when the tornado came thru a few years back. John  Thanks Joey, maybe it will inspire the Leafs as well LOL, it was a pleasure hearing the birds singing the past couple of days,,,,,,,celebrating life,,  u know what I mean.  She has only been in a plane once in her life, we are hoping she will be  up to making a plane ride up to Yellowknife this summer, as obviously she has never been, thanks again all of you for thinking about us, we don't know many people up here and to read the postings from all of you are appreciated John"
784352,ketchenany,2013-05-04 17:40:00,3229,"How Ironic, I just drove on Clarence one hour ago. I'm the end of Claremce and  just west, where Eddie  Shack had his golf course. THe  log cabin I told you about is gone   and replaced witha ""box"". I had and old map I found on the net may years ago and lost it and it even showed the island in the midle of the Humber where the two branches meet. I have to find it again. On another note, I saw evidence of beaver just at the Langstaff bridge just east of Islington, nice to see them in there. How long have you been gone? This area charges by the week. Reeves  garden centre has been gone for a while and is now home to million dollar homes?"
784386,mr blizzard,2013-05-04 22:17:00,1589,Just 16 months
784407,ketchenany,2013-05-04 23:59:00,3229,"I don't know exactly where she is but I do go up Clarence a lot and if by chance I see her out with walking I may stop and say hello. The people who live/ contributed in our life style should be admired. Wallace House is  a thing of beauty, did your family know them?"
784452,mr blizzard,2013-05-05 13:16:00,1589,yes for sure I will pm you later today.
