784614,NAW,2013-05-06 11:52:00,4022,"I am sure most of us have driven by this building on the 401, west of T.O.   What the heck is this place?   From what I can tell, it is some sort of Rad / or cooling system.  Maybe a big geothermal cooling system for something????        Anybody?"
784619,woodenboater,2013-05-06 12:17:00,2277,ya got me curious as I don't even remember seeing that  in all my drives along the 401 lol....so I hit google and found this.   http://www.power-technology.com/projects/halton-hills-combined-cycle-plant/
784620,Roy,2013-05-06 12:18:00,13728,It looks pretty impressive from the top on Google maps. I dunno what it is.
784621,Roy,2013-05-06 12:19:00,13728,Thanks....now I know what it is.
784622,BITEME,2013-05-06 12:21:00,1968,Its a natural gas generating station
784633,Dave Bailey,2013-05-06 13:25:00,1641,"You will notice that there is a large sign, facing the highway, that says HALTON HILLS (in your final picture). That makes it all clear. Obviously the Township of Halton Hills has decided to save money on politicians wages, and simply install a large hot air generator."
784634,NAW,2013-05-06 13:30:00,4022,That's funny Dave!!  I think they need. Bigger facility then!!
784635,NAW,2013-05-06 13:31:00,4022,Very cool.  Thanks for the link WB!  I'll have to read the hole article tonight.
784637,salmon,2013-05-06 13:35:00,334," Correct  There is one also one on Goreway Drive, Brampton."
784638,torco,2013-05-06 13:40:00,656,That is what the residents of mississauga and oakville didn't want in there communities....
784669,adempsey,2013-05-06 17:42:00,1498,"Lol, I asked myself the same question many times I drove past that place.  I just assumed all factories I don't know what they are make beer."
784670,Christopheraaron,2013-05-06 17:46:00,3525,"Thanks, always wondered myself..."
784671,kickingfrog,2013-05-06 17:47:00,8333,"I asked about it a while ago when is was under construction, no photos though. This place is sort like a mini Wiki (sp?) but with more personality."
784677,NAW,2013-05-06 18:38:00,4022,Yep.  OFC rocks!!  Had my question answered in no time at all!  Forgot to put NF in the title though...
784689,SirCranksalot,2013-05-06 20:10:00,3291,"  Yeah, wouldn't want Miss to become any less attractive!!!"
784691,misfish,2013-05-06 20:24:00,29133," LOL Last time I drove through Miss,I said to myself,what a waste land it,s become. Bramptons no dif. Glad I moved north 25 years ago.."
784696,lookinforwalleye,2013-05-06 20:41:00,4399,"Yep Brian moved to O`ville in the mid 80`s best thing I ever did, Barrie is now on the radar for the "" golden years""!! !!!"
784882,young_one,2013-05-07 14:31:00,620,"I believe the plant was in construction 2008? Never knew what it was until now. It's fascinating, part of the structure is suspended off the ground, I wonder what purpose it serves?"
784891,NAW,2013-05-07 14:54:00,4022,"I am assuming it has something to do with cooling.  Pulls air up from underneath, and blows it up thru some sort of Rad.  It looks like big fans on the bottom side of the suspended part of the building.  I'm sure one could Google search the construction plans for a natural gas power plant."
784901,Headhunter,2013-05-07 15:46:00,5703,"It cost us tax pay over a billion dollars to cancel the construction of two of those plants... at that price, they should be handing out beverages and meals to all of us! Can you imagine what the MNR could do with a billion dollars added to their budget? Instead, we get two holes in the ground and we get to start all over building two facilities somewhere else... oh, wait a minute, it appears that the OEB don't ""think"" we need them anymore as Ontario's consumption rate has dropped considerably since the idea was first floated. I wonder how that happened? Oh I remember, we lost tons of manufacturing jobs since 2008 and folks working at the drive through don't need as much energy as a manufacturing plant! So, one BILLION dollars and counting... Thanks Dalton! HH"
