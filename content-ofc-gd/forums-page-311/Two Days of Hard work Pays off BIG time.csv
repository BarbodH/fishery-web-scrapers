NOTHING NADDA ZILTCH KAPOOTE NONE NEGATIVE!!!  tried 2 lakes and nothing.....  the same night paul (whitespinnerbait) calls me and he is   about the brute he got in the lake right beside the ones we tried.  WELL LADDY DA!  day 2 .  start of the day  with a shower.     Then back to specks.  run through the beaten paths hoping not to get a flat tire from broken shards of glass.  portage to the lake . and there it is . speckled trout heaven.  :worthy:         these trout are feeding on leeches , minnows, flies, rock worms............ i mean everything!   Pure Sings of Health!"

784572,Moosebunk,2013-05-06 01:03:00,3970,I'd love to see some area lakes on the Ontario side of the Ottawa closed to ice fishing.  Just to get some better spring opps.  Nice speckles doods.  Familiar faces in this one.  What's the verdict on things Craig?

784579,TroutnMuskieHunter,2013-05-06 01:54:00,1362, The F-H verdict?????
784582,Whitespinnerbait,2013-05-06 01:58:00,2038,  I'd say the F-H verdict is .........Bobber is probably on another 6 month VACATION
784584,cprince,2013-05-06 02:06:00,6,F-H Verdict...?  No clue. Totally in the dark on this one. Multi messages unreplied. Your guess should be just as good as or better than mine.  Craig

784668,smitty55,2013-05-06 17:35:00,928,Nice fish guys. Craig I ran into RJ yesterday and it seems that everything was lost from the site. He was going to chat with Bobber again this week to see about getting the site up again but he didn't seem very optimistic. There was some talk of FatLuke maybe getting involved as he is a web guy but we'll have to wait and see. Cheers
