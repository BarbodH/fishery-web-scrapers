782212,jedimaster,2013-04-25 16:18:00,3472,Algonquin lakes are still frozen so I would guess most everything north of that is also still frozen.
782233,Lunkerhunter,2013-04-25 17:59:00,455,"i figured it was still frozen, my question should have been more like how much ice is there still. hahah"
782296,Rich,2013-04-25 20:57:00,3927,I wonder what the ice fishing will be like in July up there!
782297,irishfield,2013-04-25 21:02:00,26272,HARD ! Neighbour on Island across from ours... still sledding to town !  
785016,Parnelly,2013-05-07 23:21:00,108,"Assuming ice is still on the lake, are you of the opinion it will be gone by next weekend? Really cutting it close to the anual fishing trip."
785050,chris.brock,2013-05-08 00:32:00,4053," from the satellite pics today, Temagami is wide open and ice free"
777852,Fishaholic,2013-04-06 01:41:00,22,"Nice to see some of the ice (finally) fade away. For those looking for a good ice out opportunity, pike fishing is open year round in section 17! (Please stay away from primary muskie lakes!)"

778492,4x4bassin,2013-04-09 15:53:00,1025,"Just got a report from the Algonquin Park area from the weekend . Opeongo still has 15-18"" of ice and all ponds and streams in area were still locked up, as well the park is expecting 10-20 cm of snow this week . Any interior trips planned for Algonquin come the opener at this point will probably be in jeopardy   Locals in the area are still calling for a first week of May ice out . No reports from the Parry Sound - Dunchurch area but should have something in the next couple days ! One positive out of this is no blackflies for the May long weekend"
778859,SirCranksalot,2013-04-10 21:25:00,3291,"Lots of open water in the farmers' fields today----can't vouch for the fishing, though."

778862,Roy,2013-04-10 21:43:00,13728,With 35K winds Thursday and Friday you should be alright.
778864,irishfield,2013-04-10 21:44:00,26272,May 1st is opener.. have a birthday boy we need to get out there that day. Issue might be... we can't get boats in as the water is still 3 feet below datum !

I went to check Koshlong yesterday, and it was just coming off the banks.  If we get 2 days of good winds, it will start to break up fast. We have 3 days of 30 Km/h forecasted."

The trent by 12 is open water, not sure how far that extends towards the lake.  The harbour area of the bridge between cooch and simcoe is open water about 500 yards on either side of the causeway... Not much else to report on...Looks like a cold month at night still, the speckle lake might still be frozen for the opener."

777017,Handlebarz,2013-04-02 01:14:00,3790,Dang we have had open water for a month in lsc just waiting for them eyes to get out to the lake here.
777019,BillM,2013-04-02 01:22:00,17367, That's going to be tight.  If there is no ice that water is going to be so cold you'd probably have better luck ice fishing!
777033,grizzlybri,2013-04-02 02:26:00,565, That makes me want to drive up and get out on the ice one last time

777110,Musky or Specks,2013-04-02 15:40:00,2710,A week will only help the fishing. First to fish it?? That will depend on other things as well including condition of the road into the access point.

I think all lakes north of hwy 60 and even some south in Algonquin will be ice covered come the opener as well from past experience you need the water to warm up a bit and get the whole lake ecosystem moving again for optimal trout fishing (1-3 weeks after ice out is the best) If you time it right due to late ice out , this spring could be a good one If I here of any more conditions in the next couple weeks I will let you guys know . If I was you CK I would be pushing your trip back a week !"
777189,Sinker,2013-04-02 19:01:00,8692,"Yup, we pushe our trout trip ahead 2 weeks this year. Its always nice to be first on the lake, but not very often does it mean the best fishing.  The best spring troutin is when the bugs are just starting to bite."

The big river in town never did freeze over this winter but the ice was gone from Pigeon by the end of March last year...
