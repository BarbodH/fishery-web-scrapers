784659,ah_long,2013-05-06 16:13:00,354,"Went out for some Spring fishing, it was fun catching pan fish on hard baits. Got a chance to try some new equipment.  G Loomis TSR 791 GLX Shimano Cardiff Ci4+ C2000SS Seaguar Invizx 4lb Fluoro Ecogear SX40  I'm liking this set up a lot, very happy with the reel and line. For fluorocarbon line, the invizx is very manageable and there's no breakage to report so far.      "

784678,Dan668,2013-05-06 18:38:00,1120,"Nice. Whats your opinion on the rod? I want one, but am debating on grabbing a basic rod instead, since i only head out for crappie a few times a year. Did you happen to see the daiwa t3 mx? (I posted in your thread on tt earlier)"
784686,SirCranksalot,2013-05-06 19:59:00,3291,"Those fish look real crappie, but the reel much less so.!!"
784700,TheMaverick,2013-05-06 20:56:00,93," Agreed, I use to get ridiculed on ""other"" forums for loving tackle! Nice change of pace.  I've tried the Invizx, I didn't like it, I was tying a improved clinch knot.....and I kept losing my cranks. What kinda knot are you tying?"
784759,ah_long,2013-05-06 23:15:00,354," Love the rod, if you don't want to spend that much money, consider the regular TSR series. It could also multipurpose for micro line finesse applications. I also have a TSR792.  I saw the T3 MX and I like it alot, I would've went for the MX if it was available last year. The T3 is an amazing reel out fo the box, but the MX at a lower price offers room for upgrades which is what I like to do.  You probably saw my T3 with accent pieces on TT   I'm using a uni knot to Evergreen wide snap #0, no issues with losing cranks. Did the line fail @ the knot? also remember to wet the line before tightening and retie a new knot on every outing."
784764,TheMaverick,2013-05-06 23:22:00,93," Yes it was, probably heat issues!  Thanks  I must say, your steez with blue accents look pretty nice!"
784770,mbac31,2013-05-06 23:51:00,904,Where did ya get the Ecogear sx40
784787,NAW,2013-05-07 00:22:00,4022,"That's a slick looking rig!  To be honest, I am more interested in those little cranks.  I've got a few questions.  How deep are you getting the down to get bites.  Do you tie them direct to the 4lb? Or a swivel?  Are they sinking?  How do you work them?  I've got a few crappie spots I want to try, and casting cranks sounds like a fun way to target them!"
784847,ah_long,2013-05-07 07:00:00,354,"I got the small cranks from Bass City in Markham. I use an Evergreen Wide Snap #0 which makes it sink at a very slow rate. I use small twitches. I find the slow sinking action more effective when the crappie are suspended in 3~4ft and when they are not actively coming up to take the lures.  I would also look into Daiwa and Rapala offerings, they make some good small baits as well. Daiwa has one called the SC shiner and it comes in a 1.5"" size, great bang for the buck."
784850,mbac31,2013-05-07 09:50:00,904,I wonder where they got them from. I thought the distributer went bankrupt in ontario. I will have to go make a visit to Basscity. Where are they located again.
