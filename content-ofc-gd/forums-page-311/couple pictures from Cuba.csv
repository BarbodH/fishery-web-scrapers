783974,bare foot wader,2013-05-02 16:38:00,1354,"Looks like a great trip, awesome pics  DIY or did you use a guide at all?"
783976,Chance,2013-05-02 16:55:00,420,"I was there at the same time,awesome weather!!"
783977,Bondar,2013-05-02 16:56:00,817,"We mainly went on our own , we did hire a guide on the boat 2 out of the 14 days but its mostly on our own"
783978,aplumma,2013-05-02 17:18:00,6896,Cool deal nice place to go I have heard.   Art
783984,solopaddler,2013-05-02 17:40:00,8605,"Awesome, was wondering how your trip went."
784023,Shloim,2013-05-02 21:02:00,515,Well done! I was in Cuba at Christmas and caught a bunch of fish but only 2 worth mentioning...
784035,workwear,2013-05-02 21:50:00,592,awwwsome looking bonefish!!!.....congrads!!!
784039,SirCranksalot,2013-05-02 21:54:00,3291,Nice silver colored fish!  Re pic 2----you're supposed to disguise background not foreground. pic 3--I think I recognize the background!  I avoid the swim-up pool bars. Nobody ever seems to leave to take a leak!!
784076,fishindevil,2013-05-03 00:27:00,6254,Awesome looking bonefish man !!!! They are silver rockets !!!!! Great scenery as well !!! What is the first fish ?? Is that a puffer ?? Cool lookin
784080,Ryan Landry,2013-05-03 00:32:00,128,its a box fish! similar to a puffer but it can't ''puff''. it has a hard body.
784124,spinnerdoc,2013-05-03 09:45:00,556,I like the bonefish pics and that puffer is quite big too. Glad you had fun
784125,mattyk,2013-05-03 10:02:00,2110,Very cool!
784181,Old Ironmaker,2013-05-03 15:29:00,8243,"Sight fishing for Bonefish has to be one of the best experiences ever. Did it several times in south Florida. Just be careful not to step on a Ray. Can be the last thing you ever do. Need to learn to walk and kick, walk and kick. I suggest a guide until you can safely do it alone. Just ask the Crocodile guys widow from Australia."
784208,Jds63,2013-05-03 17:41:00,1365,"very nice , interesting that you could find these places on your own, i would think you need local assistance Caya Coco is a separate island north Cuba , am i correct .....    what resort did you stay at ?  bonefish and permit .... on my bucket list ..."
784283,Freshtrax,2013-05-04 01:09:00,2215,If you bring a few cheapo spools of line and some cheap reels to give away you can get local assistance real quick down there.   I  caught a few small tarpon and lots of cuda near the bridge to pilar beach
784286,mirogak,2013-05-04 01:24:00,387,"Oh wow - what's that second pic. I was debating between Cayo Coco and Varadero ... If i had seen this post earlier, I know where I would have gone. Next time. Thx for sharing."
784298,NAW,2013-05-04 03:09:00,4022,Cool trip man.  That would be a great way to enjoy a southern vacation.!
784786,Bondar,2013-05-07 00:20:00,817,"Its by far my favourite fishing that i've come across so far, i love the sight fishing on a flat"
784792,Joey,2013-05-07 00:59:00,9122,Cool
