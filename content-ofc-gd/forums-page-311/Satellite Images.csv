Yes there wasn't any satellite photos public, you had to be James Bond or something of the like, but you know what I mean. Today youngsters must shake their heads thinking about long distance land lines and party lines. One of the kids thought a party line was one of those 1-800 chat lines someone pays 10 bucks a minute for you know what."
