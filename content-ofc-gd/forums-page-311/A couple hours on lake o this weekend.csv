784611,Roy,2013-05-06 10:26:00,13728,"Great looking rig. I'll bet you're both looking forward to a full season of outings. First fish in the boat is a laker....I'd say that was a good omen,"
784618,BillM,2013-05-06 12:14:00,17367,Boat is bigger then the truck!  I think you know what your next upgrade should be  :)
784624,Rod Caster,2013-05-06 12:29:00,5784,"I thought the boat was pulling the truck haha, those trucks are brutal on gas for their size, but great off-road and in trails.  Nice rig, nice fish, nice day on the water!"
