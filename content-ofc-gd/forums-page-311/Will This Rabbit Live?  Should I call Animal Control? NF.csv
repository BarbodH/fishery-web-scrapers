783743,Dara,2013-05-01 14:13:00,3052,"Leave him be, and don't wack him  2 reasons  for one, Its not a good time of year for killing rabbits to eat  for 2, if you don't have a hunting license its poaching"
783744,Sinker,2013-05-01 14:16:00,8692,"It could even have a litter around there somewhere. You could feed it though.....lettuce, carrots, celery etc. I'm not sure it would eat dog foog, probably not.  Just spread snacks out on your grass where you generally see it and it should eat it.  S."
783746,Raf,2013-05-01 14:20:00,3495,hasenpfeffer!!  
783756,Harrison,2013-05-01 15:02:00,2202,"Just put a patch on one of its eyes, nothing will mess with Capt then."
783758,Joey,2013-05-01 15:15:00,9122," Yup, sounds like a bit too much time there Art    Hahahaha, now I like that idea"
784153,ch312,2013-05-03 13:15:00,1590," The wound isn't too old as the majority of flesh isn't dried up or healed yet and that black is either dirt or infection. Also, rabbits are well known for being very easy animals to kill which any hunter (both human and animal) would agree with. Squirrels and birds have a stronger will to live than most rabbits.  As for your buddy prolonging the suffering of those 3 rabbits for no reason other than to increase meat production, that's borderline animal abuse and very selfish on his part. Are you sure it was coons that chewed their feet and not the mesh that was too large on the floor that was tearing up their feet? It just doesn't sound right that the rabbits would sit still long enough while a coon chewed on their feet?  I raised and slaughtered rabbits for two years. Isn't it nice supplying your family with one of the healthiest meats out there at a lower cost than raising chickens?   Any update on this little guy?"
784166,Joey,2013-05-03 14:08:00,9122,"Nope, no update.  Did not see him yesterday.  Although there were a few sitting in my yard about 11:30 p.m., but it was too dark to see if Capt. Rabbit was one of them   I'll keep my eye out for him tho!!"
784169,SirCranksalot,2013-05-03 14:21:00,3291," Aw, c'mon---the guys are just joking around ('cept for Harrison. I think he was serious about the eye patch!)"
784170,tb4me,2013-05-03 14:24:00,3295,"Actually, id say they are very tough. Raising rabbits for many years now. I have seen some things that would shock and awe...I wont go into details as most here couldn't handle it.. As for the cage wires , nope.. It was coons or rats in his barn. He had well over 500 rabbits at that time.. only 3 had their feet chewed almost right to the bone. Wire wounds are quite different. After looking at that picture again I still say that wound is old..No bood on the fur and the meat is dried out where exposed..He will survive just fine..If prey doesn't eat him that is...."
784279,Sinker,2013-05-04 00:45:00,8692,We had a rabbit outside in a pen that coons got to. Not a nice thing to see. Those coons are smart!  S.
783610,Joey,2013-04-30 23:44:00,9122,"Saw this cute little Rabbit in my yard tonight and was shooting a few pics then noticed his paw                    He otherwise looks healthy and there is obviously no way I can catch it, so should I call animal control or just leave him be????"
783613,Terry,2013-04-30 23:47:00,14456,well that wasn't a lucky rabbits foot  or maybe it was
783614,Gerritt,2013-04-30 23:47:00,6129,"Joey,  I would say let nature take it course... it may have battled to free itself from something.. or escaped a fox/coyote.... if it is still alive and adapted I would say it has a fighting chance... if not... well they take the weakest first... leaving the stronger bunnies to procreate  part of nature hun...  G"
783615,irishfield,2013-04-30 23:47:00,26272,"Leave'm be Hun.... he'll do just fine and if not, let nature do what it's supposed to do."
783616,irishfield,2013-04-30 23:48:00,26272,..was that like a 3 for one deal.
783617,misfish,2013-04-30 23:51:00,29133,"Like others,nature takes it,s course. Great pics."
783619,Joey,2013-04-30 23:52:00,9122,"  Okay, guess I'll just leave him be then.  Thanks guys.  Just seems so sad and it looks kind of black and sore.  Guess that's nature tho"
783622,DRIFTER_016,2013-05-01 00:01:00,10439,Whack him on the head with a stick!!! Then stick him in a pot.
783625,misfish,2013-05-01 00:04:00,29133," Yer sick,,,,,,,,,,,,,Just like me.LOL"
783630,Sinker,2013-05-01 00:11:00,8692,I'm with drifter...
783631,StarTzar,2013-05-01 00:12:00,51,.... with carrots and spuds and onions and celery. Salt and pepper.
783633,crappieperchhunter,2013-05-01 00:15:00,2582,Thx for sharing this Joey. I hope the little bugger makes out OK. Years ago in the spring  by accident I ran over a toad while tilling my vegetable garden. Took one of his back legs clean off. I felt terrible when I discovered him. But I let him be because he seemed to be doing fine.  For anyone who doesn't know...Toads are very territorial. That 3 legged toad was in my garden for 2 summers!!!!  I guess I had enough food and shelter out there for him so he hung around. I sure missed him the third summer when he never turned up again. Hopefully your bunny   hangs in there so you can enjoy his company as well.
783634,ch312,2013-05-01 00:15:00,1590," x3  odds are it'll get infected and he'll suffer for a while before it kills him. if not, he'll be an easy meal for whatever predator decides to eat him as rabbits rely on a speedy escape if sitting still/camouflage doesn't work.  sometimes finishing the job is better for the animal..."
783641,SirCranksalot,2013-05-01 00:43:00,3291,Let your imagination run wild!! http://www.food.com/recipes/rabbit
783642,Fisherman,2013-05-01 00:49:00,7201,"Imagine yourself stumping around like that, if you have the means, speed up the process and put the poor hopper out of its misery."
783646,Joey,2013-05-01 00:54:00,9122,"  Aww, that's kinda neat.  I'm glad he made it 2 more years.  I'll keep my eye out for the rabbit and see how he's making out.  Maybe putting him out of his misery would be better, but I don't think I could do it.  Might have to get Tybo on the case"
783651,tb4me,2013-05-01 01:04:00,3295,"Actually Rabbits are very strong. That wound looks old. and not infected, he should be fine. I raise rabbits for meat sometimes im surprised to see what they can endure. I once seen my friends rabbit hutch invaded by a coon. They chewed the rabbits feet to bits thru the cages at night. He was able to save the 3 adult rabbits long enough to get them in the freezer.."
783689,vance,2013-05-01 03:12:00,719,"In my area we have a lot of wild rabbits,the dogs are actually scared of them.Its funny to see a 100lb dog running from a rabbit.I bet your bunny will live out its natural life span.  vance"
783694,Joey,2013-05-01 03:28:00,9122,"Thanks Vance, I hope it does."
783706,motv8tr,2013-05-01 07:05:00,2587,He looks pretty healthy other wise so there's a good chance he'll make it.  Just so you know animal control would not likely come out unless you had the rabbit contained somehow.  Good luck to him...  Maureen
783710,Big Cliff,2013-05-01 10:15:00,6899,"I say let him be and let nature take it's course, there is no need to kill anything unless you intend to eat it or it is a threat to you or your property. I have seen plenty of animals survive with only three legs, you'll be surprised at how well they can adapt."
783717,NAW,2013-05-01 11:35:00,4022,"Like most others here, I say go with Nature's plans...  Hopefully there not some sick twisted person in your neighborhood snaring rabbits, and steeling their lucky feet!  Maybe it's a crazy leaf fan!!!  If that's the case, then watch out for more one footed rabbits, cuz it's going to take a lot of them to give the leafs a shot at the cup!!!!!"
783719,Joey,2013-05-01 11:37:00,9122,  Thanks for the morning chuckle Nick
783728,aplumma,2013-05-01 12:32:00,6896,Funny thing about the toads I have an area under my deck that this great big toad lives. He decided it was a nice place and he eats bugs so I decided to help him out with the food thing. I put out a night light next to his hole and he would sit under it and feed. I then found 2 more toads in the area that were in the garage and feeding from the same light. It got to the point that they would line up in the garage in a 8ft area and feed together because I started to catch crickets and slid them over to them. The big boy thru summer was up to 4 crickets a night I guess I had to much time on my hands. lol   Art
783729,DanD,2013-05-01 12:33:00,2223,If the rabbit is still hanging around today; put out some food (your dogâ€™s kibble?) and water; you may end up with an outdoor pet and at the same time give him a safe sanctuary?  Dan.
