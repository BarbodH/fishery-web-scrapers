783010,chris.brock,2013-04-29 01:36:00,4053,"checked my spot today (Sunday), even with the sunny, warm weather, it's still too early  the all knowing town of Oakville posted a sign saying they've sprayed pesticide for bigweed over my fiddlehead spot, no more picking for me down there  at least they took the time to post the sign why not take the time to remove all the garbage strewn everywhere thoughout the woodlot,  I guess those educated, civil servants are more knowledgeable than me with respect to managing this shithole called Oakville"
783060,turtle,2013-04-29 10:58:00,274,"The wild leeks (ramps) are up, I've been picking them for a week.  The first photo looks like them but where I find them they are in clumps not usually singles. The smell is distinct-like an earthy garlic. Lots of info on the net how to identify and prepare for eating.  I mainly fry them up bulb & greens or pickle the bulbs."
783084,smitty55,2013-04-29 13:50:00,928,"Those flowers look like bloodroot to me. The first pic is similar but not wild garlic. At my place the leeks are up about 6"" and I'm picking a few. Fiddleheads are close but not ready yet.Cheers"
783093,TheMaverick,2013-04-29 14:08:00,93,Good info guys....this is even better then my cooking forum!
783714,turtle,2013-05-01 11:12:00,274,Picked my first fiddleheads this season yesterday.  What was up was mostly small and some havent started.  A few more days of sunshine they should be good.
784343,misfish,2013-05-04 15:41:00,29133,What a difference of week of warm weather makes. Most are already unfolding     But I managed to find a nice 30 square foot pod of pickers.. IMO This is the perfect pickers.     They will all be done in a few days.    
781586,Gerritt,2013-04-23 01:57:00,6129,"I am starting to see the ferns in my backyard start to come up... So I figure it is time to hit the bush behind my house..  But I am unsure which ones are the right ones to pick!... I understand some can make you sick and wish for death... I don't want that...  But I do want to try them! So what do I look for? I am thinking of heading into the bush tomorrow and start picking  any tips would be helpful... and if I dont post tomorrow after supper, please call a doctor.  G"
781601,fishnsled,2013-04-23 02:43:00,3520,I've never picked them but this might help.    Or this  http://www.ehow.com/how_7366937_identify-fiddlehead-fern.html
781629,young_one,2013-04-23 03:44:00,620,"Nice video Will!I've been told, there are two types of edible Fiddlehead in Ontario.  One type grow near the river and another in the hills.  Can anyone clarify this?"
781656,NAW,2013-04-23 10:32:00,4022,Ahh..  The official start to the search and rescue season!  I love fiddle heads!  I didn't realize there where ones that could make you sick..?  I'll have to do a little more research before I go out this season.
781665,turtle,2013-04-23 11:26:00,274,You want to pick the curled ends of ostrich ferns before they un-curl.  They are large ferns when up and the green curled ends start coming out of a blackish clump that they grow out of.  I don't know the proper terms.  The stem of the ostrich fern has a groove in it.  i find them in the drier part of swampy areas and along river banks.  There is lots of info on the net to identify them and how to prepare them to eat.  Don't eat raw fiddleheads.  Last Thursday I checked my spots but they hadnt started yet but will be soon.  Sunday I found the wild leeks were up and just big enough to pick.
781697,mr blizzard,2013-04-23 14:19:00,1589,"Do as turtle mentioned, he is right on the money, my parents lived in the same house in Woodbridge for 68 years along the Humber, The fiddle heads grew in the back yard under the spruce trees treat every spring, as a kid used to get them from my dads old homestead across  the road , his parents had the home which dates late 1800s, used to get them there but subdivisions tokk care of that in later years"
781703,mistaredone,2013-04-23 15:01:00,913,"They MUST be cooked, I eat them raw two years ago and it made me REAL bad!  Gov Ont web sites have warnings"
781714,misfish,2013-04-23 15:46:00,29133,I looked for them to be starting next week up this way. All I seen was brown. Nothing happening yet. Let ya know when it does. Gots to get me a few feeds.
781719,smitty55,2013-04-23 16:04:00,928,"I've been picking fiddleheads for over 30 years now. Always along rivers and creeks. I cringe sometimes when I read inadequate instructions in mags and online. Here is what I always do no matter how I'm using them. Clean and rinse well. Boil in salted water for two minutes. The water will be brown. Drain and rinse in cold water. Boil again for 1 to 2 minutes. The water will be light brown this time. Rinse well again. After that I saute them in garlic butter for about 5 min. and serve them with sour cream. I also make a fantastic cream soup with fiddleheads, wild garlic, mushrooms and green onions that is to die for. I freeze fiddleheads and leeks every year just for that soup. Good luck guys. It won't be long now. Cheers"
781731,chris.brock,2013-04-23 16:57:00,4053,"checked a fiddle head spot here in Oakville on Saturday, some where visable but still curled up tight, too early, likely later this week will better"
781734,Gerritt,2013-04-23 17:02:00,6129,Are they not supposed to be curled up tight?
781735,Christopheraaron,2013-04-23 17:17:00,3525,"I think they are supposed to be between 4-7"" long, someone correct me if I'm wrong."
781753,misfish,2013-04-23 20:12:00,29133," Hey G. Hope alls well bud. Ya,I pick them from the size of a nickle to a loonie.  YUMMY    "
781754,Gerritt,2013-04-23 20:19:00,6129,Thanks B!  Well I went out for a walk to the bush behind my house there is a tiny creek that runs through the property. They are definatly sprouting however they are very close to the ground... I think I will wait a few more days and check their progress. I cant wait to try em!  G
781755,chris.brock,2013-04-23 20:21:00,4053," yeah, the same as what I saw, visable, tight to the stump, and hard to pick without wrecking them in the process"
781758,misfish,2013-04-23 20:30:00,29133," While I,ll be creek and stream fishing this weekend. I,ll be watching out for them. My go to spot is along the main river here. I,ll be checking it out next weekend,once the opener has passed."
781853,smitty55,2013-04-24 01:32:00,928,"You absolutely want to pick them as short as possible in my opinion. Not like the stores with the long stems to add weight for sale. Specially for freezing you want them as tight as possible. Blanch for 2 minutes, rinse with cold water to cool quickly. I've had good luck adding a bit of water to the bag before sucking the air out and freezing. It may take more time to pick but my favorite is less than one inch of stem and if there is green showing I have no prob taking them off the clump. If they get fuzzy on the sides I leave them be.  Most important to me is to keep my harvest to half a clump at most. I've been picking one early area for over 25 years and it is fine still. They can grow inches in a day with warm sunny weather so timing can be critical. Keep a close eye on things. Cheers"
782136,icefisherman,2013-04-25 02:18:00,952,"I picked bunch last year this time for the first time....not sure what I did wrong but they got very mushy and soft after boiling them....we still eat them but from the pictures I've seen it seems I might have overcooked them or something? Will go and check them in the next few days...hope I can find a good recipe in the meantime.  Cheers, Ice Fisherman"
782194,turtle,2013-04-25 14:14:00,274,"Checked my fiddlehead spots today after turkey hunting (not killing). I heard 2 turkeys and saw 1 but unfortunately it was airborne after I managed to spook a deer and a turkey at the same time. My first double species spook.  Not up yet but the odd odd one is starting to show.  Maybe up in another 2-3 days depending on the weather,  I usually steam the fiddleheads for 10 minutes if fresh and 8 minutes if previously frozen..I don't boil them. To freeze them I clean the brown husk and dirt off, blanche in boiling water for 1-2 minutes, chill off for 1-2 minutes in an ICE bath, dry off in a salad spinner, then freeze in zip loc bags after sucking the air out."

782473,GBW,2013-04-26 15:20:00,8460,went for a walk yesterday and the tips are starting to FINALLY show.  It will be another week I bet in my spots.

Are they edible? How do you prepare them?  And there were lots of those pretty flowers...what are they called?      Cheers,  Ice Fisherman"
782762,chris.brock,2013-04-28 01:44:00,4053,"no, they're not leeks, I've still got a bunch in my freezer  leeks are after fiddlehead season, often during the height of blackfly season  the flowers, early trilliums?"
782771,NAW,2013-04-28 02:36:00,4022,I'm going fishing tomorrow.  I'll grab some if I see me.  But they are not up on my house yet.
