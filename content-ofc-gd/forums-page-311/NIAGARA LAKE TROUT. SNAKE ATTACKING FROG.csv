Another another Lake Trout around 8lber at 4pm .Two more lost during short fight. Number of anglers fishing in our area: 10 Number of lures we lost- I lost three 3/8 jigheads and 2 spoon. My buddy lost 6 lures from mostly spoon to crankbait. He lost a fish during a short fight. Location- FIshed the river from 8-12, went to US to pick up some stuff bought at Ebay, then fished again from 4-6pm Water clarity- 4-5ft visibility. Very high at this time of the year. Temp-: 12 degrees in the morning , then 20 in the afternoon, it was already over 18 one day before. A Sunny day. Wind direction- NE 12km. No wind at all down below  I have to semi-hold the fish close to its gills, (no fingers touching the gills) since it was slippery and trashing so much, the fish was release very fast. This 8-10 lber Lake trout gave me a great fight, I thought I snagged a Carp, since it took a while to surface. http://i223.photobucket.com/albums/dd294/bassfighter_album/trout2_zpsb65a87f1.jpg  Another 5 lber Lake trout from whirlpool in the morning. Also release http://i223.photobucket.com/albums/dd294/bassfighter_album/5lbertrout_zps36bb5495.jpg ' Story: We got down below by 8am. Met couple of anglers on their way up the whirlpool stairway, they stated they did well during night fishing from 2am-7am when water was low. Very snaggeable and hard to control our lures due to high water by the time we start fishing at 8am. We need to go back when water is low during the night. While on our way back up the Whirlpool Niagara Stairways.  Witness this 24 "" snake trying to swallow a Frog that was bigger than what it can handle. http://i223.photobucket.com/albums/dd294/bassfighter_album/snakefour_zps246c302e.jpg http://i223.photobucket.com/albums/dd294/bassfighter_album/snake3_zpsb4eda34c.jpg http://i223.photobucket.com/albums/dd294/bassfighter_album/snaketwo_zps3623d18b.jpg http://i223.photobucket.com/albums/dd294/bassfighter_album/snakeone_zps3f46e8b3.jpg My buddy grabbed the snake by its tail, and it refuse to drop the frog.  http://i223.photobucket.com/albums/dd294/bassfighter_album/vatchesnake_zpsb119e882.jpg  Sorry for the shaky amateurish video. The frog tried to escape and hid under a rock, but the snake persisted, and refuse to allow the frog to get inside further. http://s223.photobucket.com/user/bassfighter_album/media/MVI_0006_zps9203309a.mp4.html This short video showed the snake just initially grabbed hold of the tip of the frog legs, http://s223.photobucket.com/user/bassfighter_album/media/MVI_0004-1_zps27629115.mp4.html"
