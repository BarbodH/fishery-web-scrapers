783939,mattyk,2013-05-02 12:24:00,2110,"Just wondering if rice lake has a fishable population of muskies? I'm not looking for anybody's spots, just want to know if I should take musky gear with me or if I should just stick to bass fishing in the summer? Thanks. You can PM me if you want. Thanks and have a great day!"
