784093,Handlebarz,2013-05-03 01:59:00,3790,Well I'm so stoked that things are coming along for my family 2013 is our year. To many great things to list but the latest is our house that has been on the market since June last year just sold today. I had to share I'm to happy right now. Woohoo.  Many great memories there but it feels great to move on.
784101,Christopheraaron,2013-05-03 02:14:00,3525,Congrats!!
784103,Rizzo,2013-05-03 02:22:00,4754,Nice! Where are you going (or did you already go and you've been waiting for it to sell)?
784104,kickingfrog,2013-05-03 02:33:00,8333,What a huge relief that must be.

784229,Handlebarz,2013-05-03 20:35:00,3790,Thanks all yes it is a load off the mind. We moved out when dad passed Nov 2011 so we could live with mom so she did not have to go to a crappy nursing home and did not list it until June last year or July. All is going great for my family in 2013 this is just one more of the awesome positive things happening.
