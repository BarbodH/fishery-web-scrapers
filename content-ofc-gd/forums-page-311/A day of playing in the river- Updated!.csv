784287,Christopheraaron,2013-05-04 01:28:00,3525,"Went out again yesterday (and will be again tomorrow), not as eventful as the last trip but I was much happier with the colours of the fish and the lack of other fishermen  We left later than the last time, on the river by 10 am, we tried about 1km above the last spot, since we figured most of them had moved up. Found some great water and saw fish, but they didn't seem to want anything to do with flies or bait, caught 3 smolts though which were fun. So we headed back down not far from the last week's pools. Almost immediately I saw and hooked fish. I was fishing some riffles just above a larger pool, there were some not so experienced anglers (aka tuna rods) in the pool and with every cast they spooked fish up to me, I waited 5 minutes or so and then casted to them, a nice little system lol! Heres the first... (I know it looks like I caught it in the fin, but if you follow the line you can see the fly in it's mouth  )      After that we headed down to the fast water, not as many fish as last time but enough to keep me busy  It took a while and we went through some suckers first but eventually I got another, took some drag, jumped a couple times and eventually subsided.     Got 1 more smolt after that, hooked a really nice silver one but lost it at the bank, and lost a few others, and that wrapped up the day. Here are a few more pics if anyone is interested.   "
784290,Freshtrax,2013-05-04 01:53:00,2215,I can't catch a cold on any of the notty tribs this sping.  Well done.
784291,4x4bassin,2013-05-04 01:56:00,1025,"Great pictures CK , you are having a good spring eh !"
784309,Old Ironmaker,2013-05-04 05:21:00,8243,"Can you hear something from where you are? That's the sound of me shaking my head.............................................again. Way to go sir. I used to call you kid, you are no kid, maybe an alien but no kid."
784335,Djeep,2013-05-04 13:44:00,199,thats awesome! i wish i could find a spot within a couple hours of here to get back on some steel. were you swinging flies again or nymphing?
784338,solopaddler,2013-05-04 15:02:00,8605,"Nice job Chris, and some of those pictures are great!"
784362,Christopheraaron,2013-05-04 20:04:00,3525,"Thanks everyone, djeep, it was all nymphing except for 2 that were on bait"
784429,danc,2013-05-05 02:27:00,4677,What a great shot of the fish jumping. One of the best fishing shots that I've seen in quite some time.
783082,Christopheraaron,2013-04-29 13:48:00,3525,"Trout opener is a special day, it marks the start of spring and softwater fishing. The fish thought they had made it from the danger when they passed the exception limits, just sitting in the pools, unknowing that soon there would be an army of fishermen barreling down at them, throwing as much roe as they could eat passed their faces.  Our day started at 4am, on the road by 4:30 and at the river by 5. The sun was still hiding behind the trees but there were already as many anglers as you could count on the river. My favourite pools had at least 20 anglers on them but the fish didn't care, 5 casts in and I landed just my second lifetime steelhead, measured 27"" on the tape and put up one hell of a fight.    After that the anglers flooded the pool and we decided it wasn't worth it to try and battle for casting room, we headed to the next river instead. The water was high and fast, a few people got fish but it was tough fishing overall, so we headed upstream to the spawning grounds. We found good numbers of fish, but they were easily spooked and casting room was at a premium. One person that we asked caught a fish, possibly because now the sun was high in the sky, so we broke for lunch to look at a map to decide where next. On the way back we met a very kind man who directed us to 2 spots, one was strictly fish watching as the property was private, the other turned out to be heaven. But first, here's the view on the no fishing pool  Viewing pool  Once we had enough of that (took a while) we headed to the second spot, this is by far the most fish I've ever seen in one spot, so instead of bait fishing I pulled out the fly rod. Started by nymphing pocket water with wooly buggers, maggots and stoneflies, got a few takes but couldn't land any of them. So I switched to leeches and spey flies and swung them in slower water. It was easy to see the fish, and if you made a good cast easy to catch too. This was the first of the evening.   Should've taken the stupid hat off!    and the second fish      And the third     Finished roughly 4 for 10, had at least 30 takes that I missed, I'm hooked!"
783086,Christopheraaron,2013-04-29 13:52:00,3525,"Just realized the second and third pics don't match up, the first of the 2 pics was on the bait rod, and the second was on the fly."

783201,Musky or Specks,2013-04-29 21:39:00,2710,Good action on the fly Chris. It was  a long time before I ever managed to catch one on the fly. Your becoming quite the accomplished angler.
783204,Moosebunk,2013-04-29 21:47:00,3970,"Great post Chris.  Thought the pictures from the other bank were refreshing.  Don't see many taken that way.  And bud, ya really beat up on some beauty bows on a busy river.  Great fishing."
783214,Christopheraaron,2013-04-29 22:10:00,3525,"Thanks again everyone!  My goal for this year is to catch every sportfish in southern ontario (besides catfish) on the fly this year, might be a long shot but I think I can do it"
783225,StarTzar,2013-04-29 22:23:00,51,Nice

783877,c_shep,2013-05-02 01:13:00,4,"Nice report C. I'm jealous as well. There are plenty of catfish around ottawa and I've caught a number on the fly (muddlers, white minnow patterns, black wooly buggers and standard nymphs. The best pattern on the Ottawa river for me is a hot pink hammils killer with a white wing (mallard flank) tied in over the back. The river I fish has good clarity and I target them in the evening in relatively shallow water.  You can catch most fish with a fly if your persistent. Best of luck.  Ches"
