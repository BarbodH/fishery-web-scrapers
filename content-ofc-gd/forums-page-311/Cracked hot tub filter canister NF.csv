784492,davey buoy,2013-05-05 19:13:00,5505," Once again I'm looking for a bit of advice. This plastic canister cracked at the plug in three spots.This is a Juccuzi tub and it's about 20-25 years old. I think I might have troubles getting a replacement but not sure.This just happened when tightening the drain plug in. Was not even tight when it cracked. With all of todays adhesives anyone know of something that might work?.I know being at the thread is not a ideal spot for repair,but thought as I'm watching the Jays leading,and the Pits/NYI game into overtime. lol. Maybe there is something that may work?  Pits just won btw.  "
784498,chris.brock,2013-05-05 19:38:00,4053,"I run my hot tub without a filter, no problems, mine has a little screen for water entering the heater  there maybe a little more suspended stuff in the water, but my filters are $80 a pop, so I don't bother with it, oh yeah, I'm always looking for ways to save a few $$$"
784499,davey buoy,2013-05-05 19:47:00,5505,"My filter Chris is  reuseable/washable . It is quite long,and all piping is that white PVC looking material with glued joints. To change will be a son of a gun fore sure.I don't think mine has a filter screen by the heater?,I will check. Thanks"

He can set you up with everything you need and get you the parts if theyes are around. I have seen that often though and usually find a replacement no problem."
