Got a few including John's first brown in a few years.     Now he left today for BOQ opener and that left me partner less yet eager to get out. I hate fishing by myself. The joy of sharing the experience is what I live for. Beside the conversation is dull and pedantic.  The problem lies in that we've been getting 25 degree days and this is tremendously accelerating our late spring.  I've explained in previous spring reports how there is a small window where trophy specks are available in large rivers in southern Ontario. With the heat I had a gut feeling(And that's some gut) that the front end of that window was starting.  I grabbed a selection of Panther Martins and headed out.  When this time is happening the specks start to congregate in the thalwag of streams. They are feeding like crazy and pretty easy to target.  I missed my first two hits and being superstitious changed PM's and started to get some results.  Opener was just last week so I had to get a few runs away from the access before Success! A healthy 12 incher    Yes worth getting off my ass and out from behind the keyboard. From that point on every place I expected to hit a trout I did.  Another 12    A really Fat 13    Better shot of his colourful flank    Still bigger 14""    Fished right till last light(Pain in the ass wading back to the truck though) and even saw a few risers.  Last fish of the night    As I was coming upriver I came on this gorgeous looking hole that I just knew had to hold a trout.    This was the best photo I got   nother shot as I'm landing it   A beautiful 16 inch southern ontario speck Popped a chubby I was so pumped. I hope the rest of my spring goes this well.  I really wish I had someone to share this with in person tonight on the river cause it was magical but at least I have OFC to share it with after"
784300,MJL,2013-05-04 04:17:00,2427,Beautiful specks Brad. I don’t think you’d have a hard time finding guys wanting to join you on that water (myself included). Looks like my spring trout fishing is shot this year…Definitely Itching to get out on the streams for those pretty gems before closer
784303,Musky or Specks,2013-05-04 04:31:00,2710,Not to many guys willing to be blindfolded though till we get to my spots. And let me check their person for GPS trackers.
784304,Christopheraaron,2013-05-04 04:35:00,3525,"Go ahead and blindfold me, see what I care! Lol, nice fish"
784305,Old Ironmaker,2013-05-04 04:44:00,8243,"What a great report sir. Very well done. I like the video done solo. It has been years since getting a few of those beauties. You have bagged more last night than I have in a lifetime.  I  agree whole heartedly that sharing a good outing is greater than when done alone. Kind of like sex, it's just not the same alone."
784306,Musky or Specks,2013-05-04 04:51:00,2710,Seexxx? What is this word you use?
784329,Rod Caster,2013-05-04 13:01:00,5784,Thanks for sharing that! Once again I'm inspired...now lets see if I can actually catch this time haha.
784339,solopaddler,2013-05-04 15:07:00,8605,"Holy cow Brad, that's awesome! (I'm available anytime btw LOL!)"
784428,danc,2013-05-05 02:14:00,4677,You certainly seem to have a knack for finding those beauties. Well done. Awesome small stream Brookies.
784454,mr blizzard,2013-05-05 13:36:00,1589,"Great report and a pleasure to see the pics and the video, a good work out for sure but what a way to spend the day, colours are amazing."
784455,Musky or Specks,2013-05-05 13:54:00,2710,Thanks if only it was true for both halves of my moniker.
