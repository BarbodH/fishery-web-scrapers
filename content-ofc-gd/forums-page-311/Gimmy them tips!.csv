783762,manitoubass2,2013-05-01 15:41:00,11391,"These are some of my rules.  Always bring food on a fishing trip, nothing worse then traveling a long distance to fish only to be starving half way through the day and unable to concentrate on fishing/the experience.  Make sure your essentials are laid out in close proximity ie line cutters, pliers etc. and if fishing in a boat with a partner have the same utilities at the front and back of the boat.  Always have spare line ready to go.  Get all your gear/food etc ready the day before the trip. Then just a quick inspection is needed before takeoff to be sure your not forgetting anything.  I always pack extra glasses (I think that was already mentioned)  I always pack alot of water and suncreen too. When its super hot and calm weather and your fishing all day, you'll def. need these things"
783763,Jigger,2013-05-01 15:46:00,1237,"If you're taking someone out on your boat, show them the basic controls. If you become disabled for some reason, the time you spent showing them where and how everything works could mean the difference between life and death."
783765,Jigger,2013-05-01 15:48:00,1237,"Also, if youre out solo and fall in, use the trim switch on the motor to hoist you up if youre too tired to haul yourself up and into the boat."
783770,SirCranksalot,2013-05-01 17:16:00,3291, I have an important corollary to that rule: Make sure your buddy brings food too! Learned from experience!! My buddy has been known to show up t with just a couple of granola bars in his pocket for an all day trip. I got tired of sharing my food with him so now I very clearly remind him beforehand----I think his wife caters to him a bit too much at home.
783824,captpierre,2013-05-01 21:15:00,2521,"let your fishing buddy know that he pays for fuel, bait, launch and food -as a minimum"

784600,Old Ironmaker,2013-05-06 03:48:00,8243,"Be ""cautious"" about sharing information... Nothing worse then hitting your favorite spot and seeing you ""friend"" has spent all morning filling their live well on the spot you worked hard learning...especially when your in a tournament or something... I only show buddies ""community"" spots anymore... The spots that already get beat up... Keep my more ""secret"" spots for family fishing or when I need fish on a tough day...  I disagree, share and share alike. That's what we do here isn't it? That I really disagree with.  If someone offers you nada for gas after burning 80 bucks worth when they asked you if they can join you, never take them out again, ever. If you invite someone along don't accept a dime if they offer, It's like inviting someone for dinner and telling them when they are leaving they owe you 10 bucks for the steak and 20 for the booze.  I have a neighbour I invited out a few times and he actually invited his friend onto my boat the last time, no problem, then offered me squat for fuel, I paid for the ramp and gave them a sandwich each, again no problem that's how I was raised. But the last time we were out he tells me he knows a good hole nearby but can't tell me where it is. I thought he was joking, he was dead serious, it was a secret!!!!!!  . I should have made him swim back. Then he asks me today when were' re going out again? When Hell freezes over, that's when neighbour."

783667,Canuck2fan,2013-05-01 01:58:00,1444,"The most important tip I ever got was from my Grandfather...  If you are going to take the time, spend the gas money and other expenses involved to go more than an half hour from home. TAKE at least 2 rods and reels with you!!!  I have had many pals who constantly natter and chirp about my bringing too much equipment only to have THEIR trip saved by my having another setup they could use when theirs broke, went in the water or had line that had all but rotted off because they left it in the sunlight all summer before the fall steelhead season started. (Fortunately, though I have never needed a second setup for myself but I always have one just in case.) Also it is an EXCELLENT excuse to buy this year's model of rod and reel when I really don't need too LOL.  On a side note does anyone know of a fishing swap meet coming up?"
783705,mike rousseau,2013-05-01 06:23:00,4661,"Watch nature...  Look for diving birds... They feed on the same bait that game fish eat...  Learn to read water... I've been driving down the river and whipped a u turn because I saw something with the current I liked on the surface... GPS shows nothing special... And the spots usually have fish to offer up...  Time on the water is the most valuable tool...  If an angler is willing to put in the time and try different techniques... They'll be successful...  Be ""cautious"" about sharing information...

If you like fiction, you'll love dock talk.   3. IF you lose your hat in 5ft swells on Lake Ontario, forget about it. Life goes on.   4. If your better half harps on you for your lure collection, remind them shoes are not the only things that are seasonal and come in pairs.   5. If your going to buy a rainsuit, buy a good one.

Mine for fishing is pretty simple and yet one of the hardest to convince others to do. Invest at least 1 hour searching/scouting/preparing gear for every hour you want to fish. Even if you get half that accomplished you'll be way ahead of everyone else real quick  For this years trout opener I did 2 trips to walk rivers about 3 hours each trip. With open eyes you learn stuff everytime out.  In the long run you'll have way more water to fish, be better prepared and discover lots of stuff that'll make you a better angler"
