784720,mr blizzard,2013-05-06 22:00:00,1589,We have a chain drive and a shaft drive in Polaris atvs. Both do well.  My son is looking at the 2006 but apparently it is a belt drive.  If anyone has had a belt drive  atv are there any issues.  Any comment is appreciated  Thanks  Blizz

784747,mr blizzard,2013-05-06 23:03:00,1589,"Thanks IFH, that gives me the reassurance I needed to hear, never have had a belt drive but with your recomendation I am not to worried, 8000 sounds pretty good, thanks again."

Finally changed the belt for the first time this year, it was still working but I use mine for hauling logs out of the bush and all sorts of things, it is a real work horse! After 6 years of towing other ATVs, trailers full of stuff and treating it like a tractor I just figured it was preventive maintanance."

Thanks Cliff, it pays to seek some advice from others on the board who have field tested an item before you make a purchase , sounds like yours has already payed for itself, thanks again, if u go to Buckhorn catch a couple for me, miss those lakes, have a great week.
