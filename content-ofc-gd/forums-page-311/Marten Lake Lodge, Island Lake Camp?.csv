I don't know the area well and we are looking into a fishing camp to spend a few days in early June. Looking for pike and walleye as bass won't be open. Marten Lake Lodge, Agnew Lake and Island Lake Camp have been recommended. Also looking at Brennan Lodge on North Channel. Any advise would be greatly appreciated. Thanks,"
