285534,Spiel,2008-12-30 12:19:00,9065,Thanks for the compliments folks. I'm pleased to know you like it Paul and I hope it brings you many years of good fishing.   Don't know where I found the time Joey what with all the Christmas shopping and such that I had to get done. But I knew how important it was for you to have it Christmas day and what's done is done.    Now if I could just find time to get busy on the rest of them....
285812,Big Cliff,2008-12-30 23:10:00,6899,"Made by a true craftsman given to a true sportsman from a true sweetheart, it just doesn't get any better than that!"
285815,Rich Clemens,2008-12-30 23:13:00,3131,"Lookin' good Paul.   Do me a favor though .... when your giving it a workout at Lakair, don't be having it sticking upright while going under da bridge."
