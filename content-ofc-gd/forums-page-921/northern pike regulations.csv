Edited to add: I'm sure if you dig a bit, you could find regs in your country that have more to do with lobbyists and certain agendas as opposed to real biology."

284900,Greencoachdog,2008-12-28 23:44:00,8163,"  i know it...  I'm so vile...... nevermind, I've already told that one.   .. but really, all special interest groups can do is ""ask"", petition, and lobby for reg changes... they don't make the regs!  Conservative regulations and the current breeding stock are the future of our fisheries!!! Not the little immature fish. If you take the current breeding stock out of a water body, you'll have year class lapses in size and that's not good.  If you have a slot limit on a lake that is protecting the prime breeders, there's going to be a bunch of small fish. That's why the MNR encourages the taking of the smaller fish!!!  I personally feel that people that oppose conservative fishing regulations may have just a touch of greed in them, if you can't catch enough of one species to feed you or your family... target a second species to go with them, and if that isn't enough... target a third species!!!"
284930,Northhunter,2008-12-29 00:40:00,214,"I hear where pike slayer's coming from as I'm going through it on Nipissing with walleye.  The fish in the slot are prime eating. I would prefer to keep 1 or 2 larger fish but can't unless I land something over 60cm (something I would probably prefer to release anyway - just me). Now if I want to eat walleye I have to keep fish under 40cm. There's exceptions, but generally fish just under the slot are less than a year from reproducing for the first time.  Keep 4 fish that are immature but have beat all the odds and are one step away from contributing to the the health of the population.  OR  Keep 1 or 2 fish that have already made a couple trips to the spawning grounds.  You're getting roughly the same amount of meat from either option, now which would you rather choose? One removes an awful lot of reproductive potential from the population (both do - but 3 or 4 fish that haven't spawned vs. 1 or 2 that have?) The other will get you a nice fine.  I know why the regs are the way they are. Is it a problem that I have issues with the above scenario?   Re; special interest groups, etc. Believe it, GCD. That kinda stuff does go on up here. We live here. We work here. We play here (us Canucks) - a few of us even know a thing or two about what goes on around us.  The ministry recently amalgamated/revised all the divisions. Their reasoning was to make everything simpler, easy to follow. But they are also broke and trying to cost cut. Changes were made in areas where the regs had been the same for years and worked, didn't need revision. But we got stuck with larger and fewer divisions. A lot of the fisheries within these larger division got painted with the same brush in terms of regs - it doesn't really make sense to a lot of guys like pike slayer, or myself for that matter. He's just voicing what he thinks. ""Marine Biologist"" or not."
284941,pike slayer,2008-12-29 01:00:00,1177,"thanks alot northhunter! you couldnt have said it any better. this is my exact thinking, you explained it way better then i ever could."
284946,Greencoachdog,2008-12-29 01:16:00,8163," I keep hearing this, but nobody can seem to name any of these groups or the regs they supposedly changed.. why is that?... especially if you know what's going on around you!    Did you happen to catch this part of my last post?"
284964,Northhunter,2008-12-29 01:51:00,214,"Try google Greencoach. I'm on holidays.  Off the top of my head... the Aurora trout season was closed because of a new species at risk act a few years ago. With the exception of 2 places where they reproduce naturally, they are stocked, and these stocked lakes are open on a rotation. 2 of 9 lakes for a short season every year. The season still got closed.  I did catch the last part of your post. Did you read mine? I'd prefer to keep fewer walleye. Limit your catch. The problem (and need for the slot) is there will be 800 huts on Nip Jan 1st full of guys who are mostly from out of town and don't because they are here once a year. A good number of the fish they keep would have spawned for the first time this spring."
285014,steverowbotham,2008-12-29 03:45:00,1800,"what are you gonna do with a bunch of 7 pounders?? Honestly?  Regs are in place for a reason, I wouldnt argue.  If no one takes the small ones, then they reproduce so fast that the fish get stunted from over population and competition for food, then you'll have no big ones to catch.  Keep some little ones for a while."

Source: http://www.ofah.org/bear/History.cfm  Events Leading to the Cancellation of the Spring Bear Hunt  Please find below a list of chronological events leading up to the cancellation of the spring bear hunt. Click here for the official press release that was released by the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources on January 15, 1999.  December 18, 1997  F.W.C.A. receives Royal Assent; Spring Bear Hunt remains intact. December, 1997 - December 1998  Regulations being considered. October 7, 1998  Minister John Snobelen, through his Deputy Minister, promises the Ontario Federation of Anglers and Hunters (O.F.A.H.) and Northern Ontario Tourist Outfitters (N.O.T.O.) that there will be no changes to the spring bear hunt unless both O.F.A.H. and N.O.T.O. agree. December 17, 1998  Minister Snobelen states in a letter that there is no basis to cancel the spring bear hunt and that the spring is, in many ways, the best time to hunt bears. January 1. 1999  F.W.C.A. is proclaimed into law with the spring bear hunt intact. January 5 or 7, 1999  Robert Schad (who in November/December 1998 launched a two million dollar public advertising campaign against the spring bear hunt by targeting vulnerable Conservative MPP's in Southern Ontario), met with Premier Harris. January 8, 1999  On the January 8. 1999 weekend, N.O.T.O. past President Roger Liddle received a telephone call directly from Premier Harris who advised the spring bear hunt was being cancelled. January 12, 1999  Premier received the Premier's Briefing Note entided ""Implementation Plan for Closing the Spring Bear Hunt"" January 14, 1999  N.O.T.O. President writes to Premier's office expressing extreme disappointment in the Premier's decision to cancel the spring bear hunt (contrary to the position stated by the Crown, there was no response to this letter or denial that it was the Premier who made the decision). January 15, 1999  Government publicly announces cancellation of spring bear hunt because ""it will not tolerate cubs being orphaned by hunters mistakenly [and illegally] shooting mother bears in the spring.""   Source: http://www.iwmc.org/IWMC-Forum/JamesLawrence/040209-01.htm  Robert Schad is listed by Canadian Business Magazine as the 45th richest man in Canada. He likes bears… all kinds of bears… but in particular he likes Ontario black bears. He and his minions struggled against public opinion for many years trying to get the province's bear hunt cancelled. They bombarded the public with radio, billboards and television advertising claiming the bears were endangered, they were being killed to extinction for their gall bladders, and hunting black bears over bait was unethical.  His plea was totally emotional and had little to do with truth. The fact that the spring hunt was no threat at all to the healthy black bear population of Ontario (estimated to be at least 100,000), was of little or no importance to Schad and his doomsayers.   Bottom line.... Sometimes Special interest groups can actually change the regs. It does happen, and I'd bet the farm local lodges have their say with the MP's in ""some"" instances when it comes to fishing. My guess is its a rare, but happening occurance."
285118,Guest gbfisher,2008-12-29 15:19:00,0, I was gonna add that little tid bit...but 'The Nuge' never answered my email as to the who and why it got banned.  ....   Its to bad that Hunters and Anglers don't stay together on these things. Divided we fall.  
285236,Cookslav,2008-12-29 20:25:00,1457,"Yup... Its true, give an inch & they try for a mile... We gotta stick together.  I gotta say a slot for Pike does seem odd for northern Ontario? I find it a bit hard to believe populations of Pike are hurting up that way? I'm no expert by any means, and wouldn't have any grounds to dispute the slots, But I could see the Ban being more related to Tourism, and breeding Trophy Pike then conserving their population given the geographic area. Heck most Guys Up that way that I know catch so many they consider them a pest LOL..."
285240,Northhunter,2008-12-29 20:39:00,214,"There's the ""white moose"" (near Chapleau?) as well. A few people got together (I guess you could call that a special interest group) and started lobbying to protect them. There's nothing special about the moose except their colour. They are part of the normal population and gene pool and are not a distinct species or anything like that. The ones that are white just have a recessive gene, but now you cannot shoot a ""white"" moose in 2 WMU's in the north because they are of ""spiritual significance"" - no biology needed.  Someone mentioned the lake trout and Irishfield's neck of the woods. Temagami is it's own fishery, a large secular lake. At one point their lake trout regs were to be changed to be the same as the ""provincial standard"" (I dunno if that's the case now or not). Their walleye regs were changed to ""harmonize with FMZ 11 - North Bay"". North Bay is 80km away and lies on one of the heaviest pressured walleye fisheries in the province!  There was opposition to such drastic changes, but they went through. Now what went on in the meetings and who went to them... I dunno. I wasn't there."
285256,Northhunter,2008-12-29 21:10:00,214," The populations are not hurting, and the slot is odd as there wasn't really a need for it. The ""6 fish, any size"" deal was working. Don't fix it if it ain't broken. Pike are probably the most abundant and widespread sportfish in the north, and most people release them. You can fish for them year round, even while they are stacked up like cordwood in the spawning bays... kinda odd, if a slot system is needed, no?  Same deal on Nipissing. The musky fishery flourished under the old regs. It was mostly C&R, self regulated. Now in order to keep one it pretty well has to be a trophy class fish. It doesn't make a whole lotta sense. Why the change? Again, I dunno... I wasn't in the meetings. You could call the MNR and ask... but you'll likely get their PR response."
284485,pike slayer,2008-12-27 21:54:00,1177,"ok my zone is #10. I know in my area that the regs for pike are 4 under 24"", and 2 over 24"" but the one cant be bigger then 33.9inches. I think this is pretty stupid! keeping pike under 24"" is such a waste, the amount of meat you get from one just isnt worth keeping. if its under 24"" or 3lbs i dont like to keep it. when i was out fishing the other day there was guys keeping pike the size of pan fry speckled trout, like come on give the poor little fish another chance to get bigger. i realize that a pike 3-5lb is probably the perfect spawner but like come on here. change the regualtions to only keeping 2-3 over 24"" or 6 of whatever you want, bringing home 6 5lbers are perfect. every lake i know with pike in them are the dominate species in the lake probably because of their aggressiveness and not having a slot size probably wont affect the lakes. well thats my rant."
284585,Greencoachdog,2008-12-28 01:44:00,8163,Are you a marine bioligist?   The regs were written for a reason!!!
284595,pike slayer,2008-12-28 02:03:00,1177,yes i know they are there but what is the reason?
284599,BassAsin,2008-12-28 02:10:00,806,"the reason is becasue your main spawners are in the 24-34 inch range thats why u are allowed 2 over 24 and one of which can be over 34 at least they are open year round in 10 now consider yourself lucky try being in zone 11 now where u can only keep one speck over 12.1 inches i cant remember the last time i caught one under 12 inches and its to protect natural lakes and creeks that i can understand but i ask why is this ""slot"" limit on stalk lakes one of the bio's i work with said so u cant say that it came from a stalk lake but meanwhile came from a natural. that being said there are 25-30 stalk speck lakes open year round so the CO must take your word for it that in the season from the end of sept-mid feb that the fish you have came from these lakes that they are not protecting, so why the ""slot"" on these lakes from the period of oct-mid feb? talk about being ""screwed"" over with the new regs consider yourself lucky that zone 10 got better."
284608,pike slayer,2008-12-28 02:48:00,1177,specks and pike are totally different. to me they seem like a fish that just wont go away or kill off in a lake. most anglers i know dont keep any pike cause they dont think they are good eating mainly cause they dont know how to clean them so they are released. pike dont seem to get much fishing pressure in my area while walleye get hit hard.
284616,Greencoachdog,2008-12-28 03:04:00,8163,"A Pike over 34"" is an old fish and they don't grow on trees!!!  You can harvest 34"" Pike a helluva lot quicker than you can grow them!!!  Be thankful for your resourses and your regulations... otherwise you'd be siitin' on your arse bellyachin' and cryin' aboot the lack of fish and blaming it on everything and everyone but yourself... just like the commercial fishermen!!!"
284619,pike slayer,2008-12-28 03:12:00,1177,"i have no problem about the reg over 34inches. i just feel you should be aloud more in the 3-7lb range and also ppl taking fish to small. what about changing the reg to only 3-4 pike of any size. i find the pike under the 24"" slot size just arent worth keeping and should be released to grow big"
284628,bigugli,2008-12-28 04:02:00,6138,I have to admit there just isn't enough flesh on the bones of a pike under 3lbs. for the purpose of filleting. Down in Niagara they used to be open all year and netting was allowed. A lot of folks would pickle the smaller pike.
284652,richyb,2008-12-28 06:50:00,774,if you know how to use a knife at all a 3 pounder has plenty of meat ...  but i have been known to fillet a shinner minnow !!!! and to the people who say pike are too hard to clean .... they are pretty much the same as every fish i have ever done
284659,Chris,2008-12-28 11:38:00,405,GCD  Yes and sometimes the reason is because there was a lot of pressure from special interest groups....NOT because of scientific reasons. Not all regs are written by marine biologists.
284667,Greencoachdog,2008-12-28 12:30:00,8163,  Oh reallly?... and what regs would those be?... and what special interest groups?
284677,Greencoachdog,2008-12-28 12:58:00,8163," When there's a slot like that it's because they want you to take the smaller fish because there are to many of them, and like you said... nobody really wants to mess with them.  Without the slot, people will take all the nice sized fish and you end up with a body of water with nothing but a bunch of little ones.  They also want to keep a good breeding stock, and those would be the fish in the slot."
284702,forrest,2008-12-28 14:51:00,1032,It is not to wonder why....call MNR and they might give you the reason.  Fish population could be hurting and you don't know it.  A lot of meat is a relative term.  I have done well with smaller pike.  If I caught a fat 36 inch pike I would not know what to do with it so back it would go.  forrest
284704,forrest,2008-12-28 14:54:00,1032,  How about fishing lodges?  They would have an interest in leaving big fish in the water.  forrest
284705,modny,2008-12-28 15:00:00,502,i just had a wicked idea   DONT KEEP PIKE  now all your problems are solved

284726,pike slayer,2008-12-28 15:28:00,1177,"i can fillet a tiny little pike but the amount of meat i get off it just wasnt worth keeping the fish. i say you should be aloud to keep 3-4 pike 3-7lbs then maybe one big one depending on the lake and once it reaches so big your not allowed to keep it. personaly if i only went out to fish to catch and release i'd pretty much just stop going. fishing is sooo much fun and its also nice to bring something home and fish tastes soooo good! or just be able to keep 3-4 pike of any slot size, arent the small ones the future? and the lake is reproducing so that means the lake is doing well?"
284739,Guest gbfisher,2008-12-28 15:39:00,0,At least you weren't TWO'd to death as Georgian Bay was for just about every species..  .................Oh except Bass... Yup....suks large.. Have some kids and take em along with you. They have fun and hopefully everyone goes home with fish IF they so choose to....
284743,forrest,2008-12-28 15:54:00,1032,"  Yes, we could all just stop fishing altogether too.  That way all the fish that currently die after release won't die.  forrest"
284745,Spiel,2008-12-28 15:56:00,9065,....Years ago I used to bring home small ice caught pike for the smoker. They were actually quite good and the numerous small bones easy to remove from the smoked fillets. Might be an option for the smaller pike you're forced (not) to keep?
