285235,buckster,2008-12-29 20:15:00,530,Nope not me but i was wondering what the ice conditions where on that lake........... More than just whities to be caught out there........ but it is tuff fishing
285237,fishindevil,2008-12-29 20:37:00,6254,"I have caught lakers and eyes in crystal,but man its tough fishing,even in the winter,the guy that owns the marina says that not too mant trout that are ever over the slot limit,as most are small 1-3 lbs  !!!! i have never done the whitie fishing there,but i would think it might be slow as well,the lake gets hit very hard,and lots of fishing pressure...but you never know if you dont try right???....cheers"
285317,buckster,2008-12-29 23:26:00,530,only ever caught 2 lakers....... both over the slot and one big smallmouth........ all through the ice in about 5 outings. Not the greatest but u know what they say a bad day fishing...............
