284498,ciceri,2008-12-27 22:18:00,535,"couple nights ago the hose came out of the compressor for my bubbler, and all the minnows died.  so now i got a bunch of dead perch minnows, what should i do with them?"
284499,irishfield,2008-12-27 22:20:00,26272,Salt them and throw in freezer.
284500,danbo,2008-12-27 22:20:00,2646,freeze 'em in zip lock baggies.
284503,brifishrgy,2008-12-27 22:22:00,559,cover them with pickling salt .. lay out to dry .. either a coffee tin with holes punched in the bottom or some mosquito mesh will do .. dry for a couple days... flip over and repeat .. bag em up and freeze them
284504,misfish,2008-12-27 22:23:00,29133,"Fry them in butter and garlic. Dont laugh,thier tastey. Just like smelts.  Ok they do taste good this way,but if you want them to fish for another day,just throw them in a bucket of salt,but do not FREEZE them. I use to use this method for fishing browns off the old generator wall. They will last you a good 2 months without freezing.Just keep them cold."
284507,irishfield,2008-12-27 22:25:00,26272,No wonder minnow prices are going thru the roof... someone thinks their a delicacy !
284508,danbo,2008-12-27 22:25:00,2646,
284509,ciceri,2008-12-27 22:27:00,535,"lol. I donno how long it'll be till im back out there, but i'll start drying them out."
284510,misfish,2008-12-27 22:29:00,29133, Have you both been told today???????????????
284511,danbo,2008-12-27 22:32:00,2646,
284516,ciceri,2008-12-27 22:38:00,535,is that hummis on the other slice?
284517,danc,2008-12-27 22:40:00,4677,It's a shame that they died. You could have opened your own day spa had they still been alive.  Newest use for minnows
284520,ciceri,2008-12-27 22:44:00,535,i can put them on womens face and when they peel off it leaves a nice glitter look
284528,hammercarp,2008-12-27 23:36:00,964,Put down several layers of newspaper. Dump a few handfuls of rock salt ( the stuff you throw on the sidewalk). Spead the minnows out over the salt. Check daily to see how dry they are. You can actually overdry them this way and they'll float. Put in a jar or plasic bag a keep in the fridge.
284581,Whitespinnerbait,2008-12-28 01:40:00,2038,"Well ,,Leechman and I went out today  when we got to the lake the skies opened up and down came the rain   So I brought the minnows home and froze them..........     Then spilt them up into two bags      "
284583,ciceri,2008-12-28 01:42:00,535,"ok, i'll just do that, then they wont stink up the joint."
284590,BassAsin,2008-12-28 01:50:00,806,"i always salt them and the first pike i caught this year was on salted minnows i had a in a ziploc bag from march never frozen i had forgot them in the compartment under the seat on my skidoo and they still worked.  and are you allowed to use perch minnows as bait? better look into that  i think there is a lawa against using a game fish as bait, someone correct me if i'm wrong please"
284592,brifishrgy,2008-12-28 01:57:00,559,  I believe he meant minnows small enough for perch bait not actually baby perch .. you are allowed to use perch as bait but only in certain water bodies
284593,BassAsin,2008-12-28 01:58:00,806,i imagine pinheads then. ok thats what i thought about the perch. thanks
284594,Greencoachdog,2008-12-28 02:02:00,8163,Feed them to the cat!
284607,ciceri,2008-12-28 02:48:00,535,"yea, the small minnows you get a scoop for $5 or whatever. Pinheads."
284740,fishermccann,2008-12-28 15:42:00,655,Dont freeze to many as they count against your 120 possesion limit!
285308,ciceri,2008-12-29 23:11:00,535,"salted and dried them lastnight with road salt, but it had some blue pieces in it and dyed some of them blue  put them in a ziplock bag, and they'll freeze when it gets cold enough."
285311,misfish,2008-12-29 23:13:00,29133,Im very disappointed. I though you would of atleast tried the butter an garlic.LOL  Hope they work out for ya kid.
285312,ciceri,2008-12-29 23:15:00,535," haha, their kinda small and they'd probably just shrivle to nothing  i'll probably use them soon, since my sled is down and out."
