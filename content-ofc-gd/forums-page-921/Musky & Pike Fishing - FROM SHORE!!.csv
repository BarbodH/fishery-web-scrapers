285003,rbaquial,2008-12-29 03:15:00,968,"Hey Guys,  I just have a few quick questions.. I mostly do my fishing from shore, and this season I decided to give it a try with MUSKY and PIKE FISHING. So, out I went to buy the equipment necessary. After doing extensive research on 'Recommended' equipment.. I now own proper MUSKY and PIKE equipment... Anyway... my question to you guys is...  1) Is there a good place to do some SHORE FISHING for PIKE/MUSKY? If so... Where?  2) Here are a few lakes I get to fish out of...(In order of MOST OFTEN) - Lake Ontario - Lake Huron - Rice Lake  I do MOST of my fishing in LAKE ONTARIO (from shore) - Anyone know of a good place or area to try for PIKE/MUSKY? Otherwise, if not; I may have just spent all this money - only to put it up for sale  Ahhhhhhhhhh!! I need help on this topic!!  Oh, I've also been doing quite a bit of research on PIKE/MUSKY HABITAT (How, When and Where to look for them)... The only problem is, Where I fish in Lake Ontario (from shore) doesn't look like much of an area that are PIKE/MUSKY inhabited. I mostly fish out of ...  - SADDINGTON PARK in MISSISSAUGA - Link: http://maps.google.ca/maps?hl=en&ie=UT...019312&z=16  LAKEFRONT PROMENADE in MISSISSAUGA - Link: http://maps.google.ca/maps?hl=en&ie=UT...038624&z=15  - ROUGE RIVER in SCARBOROUGH - Link: http://maps.google.ca/maps?hl=en&ie=UT...038624&z=15  If ANYONE could help me on this topic, I would be SO GRATEFUL!! I'd love to even do some SHORE FISHING with some OFC'ers to share their knowledge on this topic.  Thanks again for all the help... Sorry for the 'Yammering' Rob"
285010,MuddyWater,2008-12-29 03:35:00,218,ive have caught them some hefty ski's from the dock at cesearia dock on scugog (i might have spelt that wrong) cloudy cruddy days around noon and you should get some ski's after some time out their.
285025,farsider,2008-12-29 04:20:00,456,If you have fished from Promenade park then surely you have caught some Pike there.  I just gave it a try there this fall.  I almost always hooked into at least one.

285044,rbaquial,2008-12-29 09:21:00,968, What are you using when you catch into a Pike? Live Bait or Lures?
285045,rbaquial,2008-12-29 09:25:00,968, Is there a SPECIFIC AREA in PROMENADE that you catch 'em? And what are you using when you catch 'em? Live Bait or Lures?
285108,farsider,2008-12-29 14:59:00,456,"I have caught them all around the two main government ramps.  I only use lures.  Mostly spinners but some on x-raps, spinnerbaits, etc.  I also would see the occasional salmon swimming around but could not get them to go."
