I THINK BERT COULD USE THUMBS!  <embed width=""448"" height=""361"" type=""application/x-shockwave-flash"" wmode=""transparent"" src=""http://i263.photobucket.com/player.swf?file=http://vid263.photobucket.com/albums/ii158/vishuscirquel/bertVminnows.flv"">"

285663,Dozer,2008-12-30 17:49:00,896,Love it!
285667,tbayboy,2008-12-30 17:54:00,1497,"Thanks for making my day Simon, about the only way that could have been better would have been if Bert went through the ice at the end .  I think this one will be in the running for best ice fishing video of the day.  Thanks"

285675,crappieperchhunter,2008-12-30 18:13:00,2582,Enjoyed that. Thx for sharing. Teach Bert how to run the auger and you have got a fishing buddy for life!!!
