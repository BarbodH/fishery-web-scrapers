284877,bigugli,2008-12-28 23:16:00,6138,"Should be able to obtain marine ply through Rona, the Depot, Lowes.  Although it might not be in stock over winter."
284894,glen,2008-12-28 23:37:00,2641,"Homehardware told me that they could order it in for me.  Get your wallet because two years ago i paid $90 a sheet for 1/2""."

284899,Ron,2008-12-28 23:44:00,1683,"In my neck of the woods, I had to order mine through Rona. They can special order that no problem."
284910,HTHM,2008-12-28 23:57:00,4082,"There is a place in Toronto that supplies the local lumber yards, I cannot think of the name right now. Here is a link to a supplier in Burlington. http://www.exotic-woods.com/plywood/marine.aspx As well, you may want to try Turkstra in the Falls."

285057,Pigeontroller,2008-12-29 11:54:00,2793,Thanks guys.  Just a little winter project Tom...  
285063,Roy,2008-12-29 12:13:00,13728,"What the heck happened there, Dax??"
285077,Pigeontroller,2008-12-29 12:56:00,2793,"Thats what eventually happens to wood when it gets wet Roy...My boat has a nice warm garage to reside in now, but its first 2 seasons(may-Oct) were spent at a dock."
285080,mbac31,2008-12-29 13:01:00,904,Some of my suppliers stock it still. I bought some for my trailer interior last year. Central Fairbank Lumber (Toronto) Peacock lumber on Ritson Rd (Oshawa) Britannia Lumber in Mississauga I think has it as well.
285101,forrest,2008-12-29 14:25:00,1032,"I checked out Peacock Lumbers price list (not in Niagara) They sell Mahogany marine grade.  ""Marine sub"" 3/8th 5 ply = $78 (4x8) ""full marine, solid core"" 1/2 7 ply= $105 (4x8)  Whats the difference?  Is mahogany better than other woods?  forrest"
285111,Laker272,2008-12-29 15:04:00,45,"I am a contractor who uses Peacock Lumber in Oshawa quite frequently. I asked about marine plywood a while back and they told me that marine plywood is constructed differently then regular plywood. It's all in the the way they construct the core of the sheet. All plywood is made up of a series thin layers that are laminated together to reach the specified thickness. In regular plywood these layers are made up of smaller pieces that are placed beside each other during laminating, this causes voids in the sides where water can get in and do it's damage. On marine plywoods the core is made up of pieces of laminate that stretch the whole length of the sheet, eliminating the voids from the melding of the layers side by side. They also use an exterior grade glue. When you hear of it being a mahogany sheet this only refers to what the exterior layer of laminate is made of. I hope this clears up the confusion."
285122,forrest,2008-12-29 15:38:00,1032, Yes a bit.  thank you. What about Full Marine vs Marine Sub  forrest is this OT?
285154,mbac31,2008-12-29 16:48:00,904, The finish layer is Mahogony which is used to show an exterior finish better looking than the Green sided layer usually associated with marine plywood. Usually not in alot of wet aplications. The full marine grade is designed to be in very wet conditions and is usually used as a backer for fiberglass applications as well. Marine grade plywood is also much stronger than regular ply material due to the glue and the full veneer process being made of full sheets rather than peices. If you are only using one or 2 sheets I would go with the full marine grade. It will last you longer. Remember to seal all screw holes or points of entry and also exposed cut ends properly before covering. This for some reason seems to prolong the life and keeps the water completely out.
