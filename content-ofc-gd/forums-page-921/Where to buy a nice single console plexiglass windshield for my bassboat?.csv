285145,charlesn,2008-12-29 16:25:00,551,"What model is your boat?  Some dealers in the states such as C&O Marine buy a lot of parts close outs so they have parts for a lot of brands of bass boats.  If they don't have it, a big dealer in the states would probably have something for you make and model.  I don't think a one-size fits all solution exists because every bass boat is somewhat different in their console design.  Charles"
285192,legacey,2008-12-29 18:40:00,127,I had a hard time finding one for my boat....this place was able to make me what I needed and shipped at a reasonable cost.  http://www.updplastics.com/index.htm  Good luck.  Paul

They are ok if you need raw plexi but as a custom fab way over priced.  Charles had it best whats the make and model, I have seen in the last 2 months every single windshield for sale on one forum or another A suggestion is also to take exacting dimensions and see if another manufacturer has it.  Is it a twist in  that holds it I found a lowe windshield for a previous boat that I tweaked a bit and it fit like a charm cost 120"
285592,legacey,2008-12-30 16:03:00,127," Sorry Buick14.....I can get in without problems. Not sure what's up but I do know they have had trouble with their site being jacked a while back....maybe still an issue.  I got my windshields for under $300 for the pair and that included taxes and shipping. They're pretty much the same as the Triton I believe.   Cheers,  Paul"
