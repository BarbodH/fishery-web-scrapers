284859,Leecher,2008-12-28 22:30:00,7832,"Update.... Well guys, got skunked and soaking wet yesterday afternoon with all that rain     Lasted about an hour and had to get back home LOL   Just wasn't meant to be  Today could not get out cause the rain had flooded the bay and now with the hurrican winds, just did not see myself going fishing in those conditions  Was 10C this morning and now dropped to 4C and dropping.... just might be able to head out in the new year     Will just have to wait and see.  Thanks for the kind replies and want to wish you guys a Happy New Year Jacques aka Leechman"
284942,TroutnMuskieHunter,2008-12-29 01:07:00,1362, if we don't talk before hand...Happy New Year to you to Jacques....We'll see you guys next weekend on our trout adventure  ...not sure which lake we're going to target yet...toss up between Splake and Specks...maybe Rainbows to
284945,TroutnMuskieHunter,2008-12-29 01:14:00,1362," 24/7....don't worry mon chum...I have some secret weapons in the deep freeze that will entice the BEASTS which i will share with you and the other 2 amigos.....when are we going to ""paradise lake""?????"
284954,Whitespinnerbait,2008-12-29 01:32:00,2038,"Whoa, Whoa, whoa..wait a minute Steve,,When are we going to Paradise is a question for me to answer, not 24/7   But yeah Paradise Lake is a must this year   That secret stuff you have in the freezer is more than welcome because last year hardwater was a write off on that lake"
284958,Leecher,2008-12-29 01:36:00,7832," Hey Steve, still plenty of time before new years.... how bout the 31st Dec??  I get off work at noon and be home for 12:30pm and then we could hit the bay for some fun fishing??  Sure looks like a plan to me to hit specks or splake or rainbows.... which ever comes first, I'm in for sure  Let me know if it's a go for the 31st..... weather permitting of course    I'm sure that Paul and Kevin would join us  But if it's not to be.... want to wish you and yours a very Happy New Years"

284135,Leecher,2008-12-26 22:32:00,7832,"Hello everyone, hope you guys had a wonderfull Christmas and that Santa was good to you all  For me, couldn't ask for anything more.... Christmas eve and Christmas day was spent with family, had a great time, a few drinks and some good food... just doesn't get any better than that  The 3 amigos had planned to hit good old Mcbay today for some ice fishing.... and what a day we had.... caught my first Pike and LMB    and lots of perch   Temperature was -16C early morning with no winds but once we got to our spot, it picked up to 20Km from the east  Had a hard time finding local shops that were open to buy minnows    but finally found one and the way we go.  We had originally plan to leave at 9:00am but with not being able to find open shops got to our spot at around 11:00am  Got our tipups setup in 12' to 15' fow rigged with hooks and live minnows and each had a jigging rod.... We caught 5 pikes, 2 bass and 20 perch all together  Here is Paul's first pike    and mine...    Then one of my tipups go's down and to my suprise, was an LMB.... my first    Real nice bucket, took a couple more shots      Then it was Paul's turn    and last but not least... the perch that Paul and I caught    There are more pics that Kevin and Paul were able to snap.... I'm sure they will follow Had a real fun time out there.... Thanks Paul and Kevin All fish were CPR'd except the pannies Hope you enjoy!! Jacques aka Leechman"
284150,fishindevil,2008-12-26 23:45:00,6254,"A nice mixed bag for sure !!!!.  ..and even a few buckets for a little excitement,some very nice perch morsels as well !!! i bet they will taste better than turkey     cheers"
284156,Greencoachdog,2008-12-26 23:54:00,8163,"Great report and pix the Jacques!!!  Our Bass get real paled colored like that too when the water gets cold.  Why aren't y'all lipping those Pike like the last report?  Wasn't it a bit tough CPRing those Perch?... they look kinda stiff  I know what you mean about the wind, it can be dead calm here and all I have to do is touch my boat cover and it'll pick up at least 10 mph!"
284158,holdfast,2008-12-26 23:54:00,1813,"Wow nice Pics, never seen so many posts of Bass under the Ice"
284162,lunkerbasshunter,2008-12-26 23:58:00,2585,great report!  largies through the ice is a nice surprise for sure!  cheers!
284166,Whitespinnerbait,2008-12-27 00:19:00,2038,How do you CPR  perch after they've been frozen on the ice for a couple of hours then filleted and coated with batter and  fried up for a snack   
284168,wallyboss,2008-12-27 00:24:00,1095,"Good outing Leechman.  I was going to go out this morning but the Boxing Day Sale at LeBaron's won out , I picked up a few things I needed and according to my wife a few things I didn't need.  You can never have too much fishing stuff. Never caught a largemouth on a tipup, does it grab the bait and take off like a pike or just slowly brings down the tipup like a walleye does?"
284175,ciceri,2008-12-27 00:36:00,535,"lol, nice job, but that largie doesnt look to good,hah."
284186,Fishing 24/7,2008-12-27 00:50:00,709,yep verry nice day to be out with the gang!  at one point we were 7 guys a gals on the ice no  shack nothing!  we ARE hard core!  i bet all those perch leechman caught are going to fill some plates tonight!  here are a couple of our catches!        enjoi!
284207,Leecher,2008-12-27 01:29:00,7832," Glen the water is so cold that just taken a pic while holding the fish and your fingers go num    The bass are light colored at this time of year compared to summer Lipping a gator..... no way.... not this amigo CPRing the perch.... yeah me bad    should of said ""all CPR'd except the pannies""   Dan, when bass hits, it's like a walleye, except the tipup stays half down and you have time to feel the weight when tugging the line and setting the hook."
284220,Leecher,2008-12-27 01:56:00,7832, Thanks Kevin for the extra pics    Congratulations to Stephanie for the fine gator she landed
284226,Whitespinnerbait,2008-12-27 02:23:00,2038,"Speaking of supper with family the last couple of days....  When Leechman and I got to the Bay,,He decided to walk across the Lake ,,, I chose to take the Nature Trail and work off some of that food  Cardinal    White Breasted Nuthatch    Heres a pic of Chippy     I don't know where this Dude was headed....    Oh yeah some pics of Fish...    Like Leechman said,, the wind was raw this afternoon"

284382,misfish,2008-12-27 17:40:00,29133,"What a great report and pics by all. The wildlife ones are superb. No Jacques,not you.LOL   In one pic I see a NO NO. That auger in a hole standing up. Not good for the blades. The melted ice once it hardens back up,with ruin the blades."
284383,Leecher,2008-12-27 17:45:00,7832," Thanks Simon.... weather wise here, freezing rain on the menu and right now -3C but that won't stop Paul and I, going to try Lac Leamy for some walters this afternoon  We just might have another report to post soon  Good luck to ya tomorrow.... forgot to mention, keep moving around drilling holes to locate the SMB.... once you find them won't be long before you hook into one for sure.... they're usually sitting on bottom just waiting"
