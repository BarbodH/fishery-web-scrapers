285777,Sinker,2008-12-30 22:08:00,8692,"The best thing to do this early in the season is get out there and see for yourself. What is safe for me, might not be safe for you or visa versa.  I don't take anyones word on ice conditions.  Sinker"
285779,irishfield,2008-12-30 22:10:00,26272,Exactly.. what Sinker said. If you wanna cast... come visit Midland Harbour !
285783,silvio,2008-12-30 22:22:00,433,I didn't ask weather its safe or not. I asked for conditions so I can determine if its safe and weather or not to make the drive. Thanks  Anyone else with info would be greatly appreciated. I would like to get out and spend some time with my old man.
285799,Sinker,2008-12-30 22:55:00,8692,"Ok, sorry.  I didn't know you could decide if it was safe or not from the conditions someone posted on the internet!!  Just go......hop in the car with your old man, and take a drive around. That's what I did yesterday, and it ended up working out just fine. You'll never know if you don't go!!  I have no info on the mentioned lakes, or I'd tell ya what I know.  Sinker"
