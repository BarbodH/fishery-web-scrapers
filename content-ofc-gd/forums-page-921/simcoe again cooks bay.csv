285728,Terry,2008-12-30 19:59:00,14456,"well got up this morning,.... always a good start to the day  and decided to check out cooks bay I got to the bottom of Gilford road and saw about 30 people out on the ice   well grabbed my stuff and I ventured out  right off the bat the ice at the shore is broken up and you have to move fast to not go down...not a good start  but I know the water is  under a foot deep there   as I walked I could hear the ice making noises, lots of noises  kept checking and seemed to be 4/5"" everywhere I came up on a slush field and when I first broke through it scared the hell out of me, but I think it was just the top crust of frozen slush that broke...I hope..did a detour around it and continued on out fished around 17 ft.... fishing was slow and I moved around a bit there was a air boat tied up out there and I think that is what broke up the ice at the shore...  it was snowing real hard so I didn't want to drive home in bad weather so I packed up and headed in, found the same slush field again but made it in just fine there shouldn't be any problems for people going out as long as they keep checking as they go  be safe if you go and wear a floater suit like I did    <a href=""http://s25.photobucket.com/albums/c52/Mrbeee1954/?action=view&current=cook.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://i25.photobucket.com/albums/c52/Mrbeee1954/cook.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photobucket""></a>  <a href=""http://s25.photobucket.com/albums/c52/Mrbeee1954/?action=view&current=cook1.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://i25.photobucket.com/albums/c52/Mrbeee1954/cook1.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photobucket""></a>  <a href=""http://s25.photobucket.com/albums/c52/Mrbeee1954/?action=view&current=cooook1.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://i25.photobucket.com/albums/c52/Mrbeee1954/cooook1.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photobucket""></a>      was great to get out again"
285730,johnnyb,2008-12-30 20:03:00,3413,"Nicely done, Terry -- glad you made it back"
285731,douG,2008-12-30 20:03:00,2693,"Very nice, Terrance.  The Lady Simcoe looks beautiful."
285738,BUSTER,2008-12-30 20:45:00,1336,"that ice Scares the heck out of me.   not sure why but i think thats my biggest fear , falling thru the ice."
285751,Terry,2008-12-30 21:20:00,14456,"yeah it can make me pretty nervous too  if you want scared sit in a fishhut at 3 in the morning and listen to the ice cracking, sometimes it sounds like it's coming right through the hut...."
285802,ciceri,2008-12-30 22:58:00,535, Scugog is good for that.
285803,Sinker,2008-12-30 23:00:00,8692,Looks like some good black ice out there still. Thats always good to see. I'm hoping to get out for some perch tomorrow......  Thanks for the report!  Sinker
285822,lookinforwalleye,2008-12-30 23:22:00,4399,"Waiting a week or so would be prudent for those who don`t like to tempt fate.  At least they don`t have their vehicles parked on the ice yet, the Simcoe crowd likes to see 6"" before using the lake as a parking lot! LOL  Stay safe out there!"
285833,misfish,2008-12-30 23:32:00,29133,"Yer just crazy.or the wife said ,get the he ll out of the house,yer driving me crazy.LOL"
285839,Terry,2008-12-30 23:43:00,14456,yeah that pretty much sums it up  but it was safe or I wouldn't be there
285846,forrest,2008-12-30 23:56:00,1032,You re one safe dude Terry.  Was a fan boat I saw out there?
285848,Greencoachdog,2008-12-30 23:57:00,8163,So... what?  Like the top of the lakes freezes into ice or something and you fish thru little holes in it???  ... aren't the fish frozen too?... or is that why all fish in the GWN have teeth.. so they can chew thru the ice???
285866,Clampet,2008-12-31 00:23:00,1947,"Keep at it and b4 you can say: ""Bob's yer uncle"" the tiny Perch will have a close up of yer sad lookin' mug."
285896,fishindevil,2008-12-31 01:13:00,6254,Must have been nice to get out terry !!! thanks for the report & ice up-date...maybe i can get out real soon with percher !!!....cheers
285902,Terry,2008-12-31 01:18:00,14456,with a high of -13 tomorrow I would think skidoos will be running around by the weekend
285976,Joey,2008-12-31 03:35:00,9122,"Oh Terry, that's scares me just to read that.  When we meet up again this season, you go first K??  C'mon cold weather  Joey"
