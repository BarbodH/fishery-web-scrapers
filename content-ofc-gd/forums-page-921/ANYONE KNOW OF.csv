285512,Twocoda,2008-12-30 06:11:00,4130,Although reports were not favourable for the credit ...im sure there are bows in there ...ill tell ya where to go .....go right into Missisauga Erim Mills Park ....walk up river till you come to the rock baskets...( river is narrow there and makes a sharp turn ) fish down from the sharp turn ....really nice pool and if you havent crossed the main river and still on the side of the gracel path ...stand on the rock baskets ( meidum size rocks in wire mesh)and just fish ...there is no need to cast very far as the bows will more then likely be tight to the baskets....i have literally caught HUNDREDS of fish in this pool...but havent fished it in several years ....great salmon and bows....  down at the mouth of the credit is a good spot as well ......fish will be fresh out of the lake ( either side of the river is great under the walkover bridge) good luck ....if ya do go ....bring worms ....real and pink
