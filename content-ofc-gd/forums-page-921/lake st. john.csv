285767,fishnpro,2008-12-30 21:52:00,93,I would not recommend going to johns for a couple days......the shore ice at the plant is gone and you have to walk across water to get on the ice and airport is the same. We walked over 3ft of water on logs just to get out onto the ice. Believe me its not worth the walk out there.
