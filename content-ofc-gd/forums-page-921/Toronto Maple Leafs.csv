284433,MarcusDiGiovanni,2008-12-27 20:03:00,182,"sorry about the tittle I can't spell  . Anyways I just thought i'd bring up the maple leaf subject once again. I believe that deep down everyone who's from Toronto or lives around Toronto ie. GTA etc. wants the leafs to suceed. I know that some people migrated from other cities and have grown attachments to other teams and thats great, what i'm talking about is people who were born and rased hear. We'd be hard pressed to have a montrealer root for the leafs   Take me for example I lead everyone to believe I hate the leafs and I think I do, but theres a little place in my heart where I want the leafs to win. Now winning might not be ""winning""  . ""winning"" could be losing and getting a high draft pick so that they can pick up a talanted youngster who they can rebuild around. I played Rep hockey since I was 7 and recently quit, however I still love and follow the game, it'd be great to see them build A dynasty in the greatest hockey market in the world.  . Anyways  I just wanted to express my thoughts and contribute to the forums, And I know most if not all of you will disagree but HEY it gave you somthing to do for a couple of minutes didn't it  PEACE, Marcus"
284446,irishfield,2008-12-27 20:35:00,26272,A brave young man... starting a hockey thread ! lol
284447,MarcusDiGiovanni,2008-12-27 20:40:00,182,haha lol
284448,richyb,2008-12-27 20:41:00,774,"yep they seem to suck just enough to miss the playoffs  but not enough to get a great draft pick ... Im also a habs fan but i can atleast cheer for the leafs to make the playoffs one year !!!!  I like the new leafs team , they look faster and playing with tons of heart. I cant wait for the game tongiht  HABS vs PENS  my 2 fav teams"
284450,MarcusDiGiovanni,2008-12-27 20:46:00,182,"They've got some fast young guys, I like the way Grabovsky plays, as a matter of fact he's my friends cousin!!!. Yup pens have a solid team along with the habs, should make for a great match up."
284459,BillM,2008-12-27 20:57:00,17367,Gotta rebuild sometime!  Last time they were even in the running was '93-94..  To bad it took them 15 years to realize this.
284466,misfish,2008-12-27 21:10:00,29133,"Anyone notice whos behind the Juniors bench?  Now theres a coach,and a team. Leafs will be here for many a years,but these young bucks have to prove something."
284470,Stoty,2008-12-27 21:19:00,2910,"It's just too bad neither, the Leafs, Habs or Pens are any match for my Red Wings again this year!"
284488,BillM,2008-12-27 22:01:00,17367,It's to bad the Red Wings are in a town that can't support them.  When was the last time they sold out the Joe?  Their ticket prices aren't bad at all.  I wish they were a bit closer.
284683,lunkerbasshunter,2008-12-28 13:25:00,2585,dont be surprised if come trade deadline the leafs are a total different team with a pile of draft picks and prospects in there pockets.  Going to be a tough couple more years for leaf fans!  Cheers!
284707,nofish4me,2008-12-28 15:03:00,404,"The problem is, they don't need a winning team to fill the rink. The population base is big enough, they can fill the place with fans of the visiting teams. If they were hungry to fill the rink, they may do better."
284713,fishboy,2008-12-28 15:13:00,550,  hmmm...wonder if it's time for another team in S. Ont..maybe a little competition for the market would smarten the Loafs up...and give us true hockey fans the chance to perhaps get our hands on an affordable ticket?
284799,MarcusDiGiovanni,2008-12-28 18:12:00,182,"kithchener/waterloo perhaps, thats where balsille, wanted to take pitsburgh! Imagine Crosby and Malkin In S.O"
284816,chickenhawk,2008-12-28 19:30:00,612,you poor poor leaf fans......they might finish in 10th place in the eastern conference this year......at least its a step closer lol.....
284827,uglyfish,2008-12-28 20:28:00,981,"until the leafs get rid of that waste of space called vesa toskola, they'll be destined for disappointment and failure. fortunatly, all us leafs fans... happen to be seasons vetrans in THAT department!"
285161,bassmaster4,2008-12-29 17:13:00,801,did you not watch the season opener??
285380,chickenhawk,2008-12-30 01:01:00,612, have you not watched the rest of the season thus far?
285569,F7Firecat,2008-12-30 14:26:00,347,"i dont watch the leaves  When they are on TV I just turn them off.  MLSE is waste of time and until leaf fans realize this they will get nothing but the same they have got for the last 40 years.  Sell out another one, MLSE just loves it and doesnt care to put a team on the ice."
