285158,misfish,2008-12-29 16:57:00,29133,"Dont tell me this.It,s a bright sunny day out here and warm in the sun. Little wind,but from the south."
285166,Tdel,2008-12-29 17:20:00,393,"I feel the same way Misfish, please don't shoot the messenger.    I thought the wind warning was all over last night and was surprised to see another one on Environment Canada website.  I noticed the weather channel only mentioned Grey-Bruce so I double checked their website and it is the same as Environment Canada.  Looks like more wind coming for a visit.  Nice to see the sun once in a while.  We have had our share of snow, although after the rain it doesn't look quite so bad.  Tom."

We had two or three last year, we had one yesterday and we're getting one tonight."
