My dad at first spotted a doe, and with some patience, I watched another 3 more does emerge from the bush. While watcigng them feed, I noticed somediturbance just past them, luckly enough, a coyote came out of the bush to check out the deer!  Though, the yote' didn't seem very interested in the deer, so it eventually ran off. I attempted some shots at the deer, but they were too far off to get a clear view, but I was able to get some pictures, quality wasnt very satisfying, but I didn't have my zoom-in lens    "
