284781,Jen,2008-12-28 17:34:00,833,"The ice went out this morning on the river, still holding in the marina! For how long I have no idea! Watching the water rise has been amazing today.  Here are a couple of pictures of the marina,    The poles are usually 5 or 6 feet above water level...   Rock point on the flag side is under water and the entire cement pad on the lake side.  Crossing my fingers that the levels don't raise enough to crest the banks today!   How is the weather in other parts of the world today?"
284835,xrap,2008-12-28 20:47:00,683,"At first I thought you guys cut off half the pole, that is insane."
284837,Garry2Rs,2008-12-28 20:59:00,1425,"Winds from the north at 11 MPH, sunny and 59F in Yuma Arizona. The forecast is for highs of 72F all next week. The nights are cool...around 40F, but it warms up fast once the sun comes up. The Bass fishing has been slow, but I have my daughter here for a few weeks, so I don't get out much. By the time she heads home the pre-spawn bite should be on...at least I hope it will be."
284839,fishindevil,2008-12-28 21:14:00,6254,"I hope you guys are past the high water mark by a few feet jen !!!! they have high water warnings out for the trent severen waterway as well !!!!....im sure there is going to be flood damage somewhere,lets hope everyones ok !!!! keep us updated jen !!!...cheers    shawn"

284891,Sandbag,2008-12-28 23:36:00,533,Hey Jen...I remember Steve posting pictures of the same thing last year.  If I remeber correctly it dropped just as fast as is rose.  Thanks for the update..hard to believe that Steve was out on the river a few days ago.  Cheers  Craig

285051,Rich,2008-12-29 10:54:00,3927,I guess the bright side is that when that water drops again and she ices up there could be a few fresh runs of 'eyes up there for the taking!
285095,Mike Pike,2008-12-29 13:54:00,1332,"Just drove over the Grand in Kitchener a few minutes ago, Jen, and she's high and over the banks.  Thanks for taking the time to post that update and pics from down your way!"
