282149,BassAsin,2008-12-21 02:00:00,806,"yes jaques just the two and live minnows are not allowed in all lakes and personally think that dace are the only live minnows that should be allowed here as they dont disturb and eco system too much. how many lines are you allowed across the creek?   where abouts ""up north"" you and your son headin DONT GET CAUGHT?"
282157,Leecher,2008-12-21 02:14:00,7832," Thanks DGC Wish you and your son the best of luck I'll be keeping an eye out for your report   Here we are allowed 5 lines / tipups per permit and the only zone that we can use live minnows is 25.... the Ottawa river.   All of the other creeks, lakes and rivers dead minnows only  That's OK.... just need a little elbow juice to keep the tipup jigging"
282160,BassAsin,2008-12-21 02:27:00,806,"well lucky you!!!! i normally use salted minnows any how and only two lines!!! elbows must be hurting at the end of the day, although i have to say that Quebec does have a what i would say is a better fish and wildlife program than here especially wildlife and dont blame them for trying to keep it that way!"
282167,Leecher,2008-12-21 02:42:00,7832," Matt, two lines is enough to handle..... heck today, was only able to set 3 of them and could not keep up    as the perch was on fire.... but a lot of hit and miss  There are some wildlife rules that are different in QC from Ont and can just don't understand why it shouldn't be all the same Canada wide"
282169,BassAsin,2008-12-21 02:47:00,806,its the days when the bites slow that 5 would be nice! and as for why its not nationwide is because how do u reulate alberta deer numbers to quebec and so on and so forth but ontario is behind the ball on the wildlife aspect for sure in many areas!
282177,Leecher,2008-12-21 03:03:00,7832," Matt what I'd like to see for QC is the group hunting party.... I think that it does not matter who shoots the animal... what counts is the results from a group aspect  Here in QC, once you tag a deer your hunting is over.  We don't even get extra tags like you guys have... if we are lucky, we get a doe tag from a draw.  Enough said about that and lets get back to hard water fishing.... going tomorrow for sure around 9ish if the  winds cooperate  Tight lines J"
282200,Fishing 24/7,2008-12-21 03:34:00,709,HEY jaques great to have been out with you and WHITESPINNER!  i was looking for the EYES but they never showed up!   are we still up for tommorow????  the pike are calling my name!
282204,Leecher,2008-12-21 03:39:00,7832," Yes Kev, come on over tomorrow for sure... if Paul don't want to go I will     We should be leaving aroung 9ish"
285328,joco,2008-12-29 23:47:00,57,onother great report  man i should come here to look at you guys report more often.  this is where i might head out tomorw morning..if i am not going to the little bay across the river or mc bay.  its so close to my house like..3min.  .  thanks to share those picts/report  joco
285336,limeyangler,2008-12-30 00:03:00,5204,"Nice one guys (the 3 amigos....lol)  By the looks of it a busy day!   Like Whitespinner bait said in a reply tomy post earlier,lots of perch to keep ya active and warm....but the walleye   Great pics guys   thanks for sharing.   Simon"
285349,Leecher,2008-12-30 00:28:00,7832," Joco, if you are going to Leamy I'd recommend that you go towards the beach and setup in the drop off, I'd say about 100' from shore.... that is where I caught all of the perch and it was none stop from the very beginning.   There was about 8' to 15' feet of water and a nice weed bed...  If not McBay is another good area.... Good luck to ya tomorrow"
285358,tbayboy,2008-12-30 00:39:00,1497,Nice stuff leachman.  Bit chilly but the perch probably helped keep you warm running back and forth.
285378,joco,2008-12-30 00:59:00,57,the beach is the place or one off the place i go wen going to that lake..one other place is on the far right wen looking the lake frome the restaurant...goo place there to...but the beach is usely better.  but to go there and park at the parking you have to go true that channel..not as mutch ice..current in that channel...  remeber that machine that went true 2 yers ago there.?  joco
285381,Leecher,2008-12-30 01:02:00,7832, Thanks Sean.... It sure did
285388,Leecher,2008-12-30 01:09:00,7832," On the far right, the lake is deeper and rocky bottom.... Me and Paul tried last Saturday afternoon but the rain was coming down so hard, we had to leave cause we were soaking wet  I remember that machine that went throught the ice in the channel a couple of years ago..... directly in front of the channel about 150 yards is a good spot..... there is another drop off and is where Paul caught is very first muski, not the biggest but a lot of fun."
285431,Whitespinnerbait,2008-12-30 02:16:00,2038,  What machine was that   ????????????
285437,Leecher,2008-12-30 02:22:00,7832, Skidoo Paul

282040,Leecher,2008-12-20 21:25:00,7832,"Well guys the plan was for the three amigos Fishing 24/7, whitespinnerbait and me to go to Lac leamy and try for the elusive walleyes.  Got there at around 9:30am this morning, temperature -16C with 10 Km north east winds and sunny..... just what the doctor ordered  Since it was our first time going this year, as soon as we arrived at our spot on shore we drilled a hole with the auger to check the ice thinkness...... 4"" of black and 2"" of white..... safe to walk on    and got setup.  Since this lake is in zone 10 and part of the Gatineau river we were only allowed dead minnows.  I was fishing in 8' to 10' fow on top of a weed bed.  As soon as I had my first tipup ready.... I get a hit.... turn around and start to pull in the line only to see a decent perch make a U turn at the top of the hole  Got a couple more tipups setup and it was none stop action, a lot of hit and miss but truly lots of fun.   Took a pic of my tipups and the other two amigos jigging away    A few hit & miss later and I get my first perch.... about 9""    Since the perch was somewhat active, I truly believe that we would hook into some eyes but alas wasn't meant to be  Got into a few more and at around 2:00pm called it a day.... here a few pics            Fishing 24/7 got one jigging    Was great to be out on the ice and had a great time amongst friends Hope you enjoy Jacques aka Leechman"
