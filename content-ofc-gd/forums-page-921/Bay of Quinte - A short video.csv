284513,Stoty,2008-12-27 22:34:00,2910,Where on the Bay is it safe to venture out? Picton? Belleville?
284518,Jeff_C,2008-12-27 22:41:00,50,"After today's rain as well as tomorrow's, I'm not sure if even where we were fishing will be safe.  We were on 5-7"" this morning, but we are loosing it fast.  I'll be out checking it again soon and we'll have to see.  So at the moment, I would say that nothing is safe.  Jeff"
