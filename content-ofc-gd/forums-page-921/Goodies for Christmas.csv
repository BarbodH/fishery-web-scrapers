As you can see what was lost in quantity was made up for in quality. I am excited about the GPS. The map card is for the Great Lakes and Trent system and seems to cover many of the lakes that I frequent. It was a great surprise and I can't wait to put it to good use. The Live Target lure was a suggestion from the salesman (much like the GPS, I am appreciative but would not likely have spent my own money on it) and you can never have enough stuff from Berkley. Happy New Year to all! (while I've got your attention) Jim "

285360,fishindevil,2008-12-30 00:40:00,6254,"Nice presents from santa jim !!!!   you will love the gps,i have mine on my boat as well,with the navionics gold chip,xl14 and it works great,you can mount the unit on a ram mount,that way you can swivel it around for different angles so you can see it from wherever you are,i use it as a back up,to my lms -lowrance,ill leave the graph on sonar,and use the h20 on the map,its a great set-up !!! those live target perch lures are nice too,im looking forward to using them as well,they look so real ??? and you can use the h20 for ice fishing too!!!...cheers"
285361,Radnine,2008-12-30 00:40:00,1538,"Yes I have, I've got bags of gulp stuff. Essentially it's a Mr. Twister that tastes good. I used YUM plastics a lot last year as well. Jim"
285366,Radnine,2008-12-30 00:45:00,1538,"I guess that I should mention that the GPS was a complete shock to me. My wife decided on it by picking the brain of my nephew and no doubt, a brother-in-law or two. I am a lucky man. Jim"
