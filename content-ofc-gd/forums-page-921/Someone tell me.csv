285467,misfish,2008-12-30 03:29:00,29133,"And NO,Im not drunk,just incase, ya,ll are wondering. I just could never figure this one out."
285468,Fang,2008-12-30 03:29:00,1330,caused by the wind fluctuating the air pressure in your plumbing vent/stack. When the wind blows hard pressure builds up inside the stack and actually will push water back up into the plumbing system.  My wife calls me a wealth of useless information!
285470,Muskieman,2008-12-30 03:34:00,2472,Bang On!!  My wife also calls me that..        .Did you know..that..

285500,douG,2008-12-30 05:09:00,2693,What Fang said.
285519,tschirk,2008-12-30 07:29:00,261,If the wind blows perpendicular (across top of pipe) it will create a venturi effect that will cause low pressure in the vent pipe and it will draw water upwards! This is the same effect as in a paint spray gun or carburetor. Also ingesting extreme quantities of alcohol can create the same visual effect too!
