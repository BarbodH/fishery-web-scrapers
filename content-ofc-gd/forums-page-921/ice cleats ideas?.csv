284610,jjcanoe,2008-12-28 02:49:00,744,Or buy 15 pairs from Dollarama for the same price! LOL  jjcanoe
284614,danbo,2008-12-28 02:57:00,2646,15 pairs of what?
284703,pameladallaire,2008-12-28 14:52:00,470,"We have Dollarama up here but I never looked for that, could use them today.    It's solid ice and pouring rain outside my door.  You can be sure I'll check next time I'm there.  Pam"
284714,fishboy,2008-12-28 15:15:00,550,maybe I'm just lucky with the boots I have or all those years of hockey gave me some balance but I've never had a need for cleats.  Reasonably soft soles seem to grip just fine.
284775,jjcanoe,2008-12-28 17:26:00,744, 15 pairs of pull on ice cleats.  $1/ pair  jjcanoe
284782,misfish,2008-12-28 17:36:00,29133, A simple hip check would solve that.LOL  Dollar store you say. Just may need to take a gander for them.  Thanks for the heads up JJ
