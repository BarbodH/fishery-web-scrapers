285169,fishboy,2008-12-29 17:29:00,550,Italian breadcrumbs & (real) parmesian cheese (not that stuff on the supermarket shelf) makes an awesome coating.
285170,Canuck2fan,2008-12-29 17:30:00,1444,"I like Cronzy's better but fish crisp is decent enough.  I found out that with Cronzy's if you don't like a ton of sodium just take one 1 cup of it and add 2tbsp flour to it or if you want it come out extra crispy add 2tbsp of corn starch. Blend it well together and then use it the same as directed, it still has plenty of flavour.  If you really want to freak someone trying to figure out how you made it take some chicken wings dip them in Franks red hot sauce. Throw them in a ziplock bag with Cronzy's mix diluted as above. When then are coated take them out of the bag after squeezing each wing really firmly. Knock of the excess coating and deep fry until done. Serve with a good home made blue chesse dip NOT crappy old store bought salad dressing. Oh and have the odd wobbly pop available because this will make your guests thirsty. You can keep the first batche(s) hot in a 250 degree oven on a baking sheet while you cook enough for everyone or bust out your turkey deep fryer to be able cook enough all at once.  As an excellent side dish soak 3/8"" wide onion rings in buttermilk overnight and then toss them in the diluted Cronzy mix BEFORE you coat the chicken to avoid cross contamination. Separate the coated onion rings and just leave them on a baking tray that you covered with wax paper. Since they won't stay as hot as the wings or hold in the oven as well fry the onion rings after the chicken. Make lots though because people will scarf them down...."
285176,Walshskie,2008-12-29 17:44:00,58,"Try putting the left over fish crisp on you potatos, you can oven roast them that way or fry them.  Personaly I won't use his crap just because his name is on it."
285239,bigugli,2008-12-29 20:38:00,6138,"After having coated your fish with the fish crisp do not throw it out. Mix a little milk to the dry coating to make a thick batter, or thicken your left over beer batter with flour.  Fry it up  as a bannock. put some chopped onion in the leftover mix if you like. The result is quite tasty."
285319,Rich,2008-12-29 23:31:00,3927,"They should call it Salt Crisp.. blegh, I'll stick to Rich Crisp"
285329,BUSTER,2008-12-29 23:48:00,1336,"well i had it and the kids ate it the wife loved it, ill use it again for sure!  i'd love to try it on onion rings and pork chops too... made 3fillets and the rest i chopped up into nuggets"
285421,steve barrett,2008-12-30 02:05:00,142,Guys I have tried the fish crisp I really find it too salty.I don't really use a lot of salt on my food and I found this batch a bit too salty.Maybe I should have cut it with a little beer and some for myself and after a few more beers It might have tasted better. This year I might try you know who's stuff I hear it tastes not bad mixed with beer.
285491,Beats,2008-12-30 04:53:00,543,"I don't mind fish crisp.  I always somehow manage to sneak beer into almost any of the varieties.  If it calls for liquid I find a beer is always handy.  IT all depends on the species of fish you are using.  Fish like perch I just cook in nothing but butter, but something like pike, to me, is always better battered.  To each his own.  I do say that I really liked the pike I had in the spring with the cajun version of fish crisp."
285495,Twocoda,2008-12-30 05:00:00,4130,"i must be tired cuz i didnt see what kind you tried... sorry if i missed it ....  ill get away from this ""MINNOW"" status somehow...lol....blah blah blah"
285509,birddog,2008-12-30 05:51:00,1," MrEh....It's called Pickrel Perfection, I spoke with folks during the summer and he sold the business and have not been able to find any since. Good stuff!!"
285654,mark02,2008-12-30 17:40:00,27,"Try this and it'll save you money and save your health.  Go to the grocery store and pick up the following:  - White corn flour - Yellow corn flour - White cornmeal - Yellow cornmeal  Each bag contains 750 grams.  This will cost you about $8. Mix equal parts of each.  That's 3000 grams of home made fish coating vs $4 for 350 grams of Fish Crisp. Add your favourite spice eg. salt, pepper, garlic powder, paprika, onion powder, etc. Dust fish and fry away.  FishCrisp and Daryl's fish coating both contain hydrogenated oil.  Google hydrogendated oil - not pleasant stuff.  When you read hydrogenated oil or partially hydrogenated oil think sludge for your heart and arteries."
285737,fishinggeek,2008-12-30 20:35:00,325," Thanks for the recipe.  I also won't try these coating because of all the junk ingredients that are in them.  I've made coatings like the one you mentioned and not only are they better for you and cheaper, but I find they taste better too.  Plus you can control the amount of salt and spice to your liking.  They're really easy to make, and I make bigger batches so I can store the rest."
284931,BUSTER,2008-12-29 00:42:00,1336,"I bought some fish crisp for the 2 pickeral's i caught yesturday, I was wondering if any of you guys like it or hate it?  and what flavor?"
284934,fishindevil,2008-12-29 00:46:00,6254,"I love it !!!!   i like all the flavours,but if i had to pick one it would be the original,followed by italian !!!!cheers"
284935,purekgw,2008-12-29 00:48:00,585,yah the italian is really good i like the beer batter to
284936,MCTFisher9120,2008-12-29 00:49:00,3761,Fish Crisp Cajun
284937,pike slayer,2008-12-29 00:50:00,1177,its some real good stuff. i always get the gralic and butter and i wash the fillets and just put them in the powder no egg or anything then just fry them up in oil
284939,BUSTER,2008-12-29 00:51:00,1336,i picked up the roasted garlic and butter flavor
284940,Twocoda,2008-12-29 00:58:00,4130,Fish Crisp doesnt make a product i dont like ...but beer batter and italian rock!!!...its been so long since ive had a pickeral i dont think i would put anything on it other than lemon pepper and butter....  Enjoy the meal
284943,Leecher,2008-12-29 01:10:00,7832,Never tasted / had Fish Crisp before but I prefer to dip my walleye filets in flour and crushed froot loops and then cook'm in butter.... a little salt and pepper to taste and voila
284944,forrest,2008-12-29 01:14:00,1032,I have had it a few times.......it was goooooooood.
284947,bigugli,2008-12-29 01:17:00,6138,"Use the stuff all the time. Especially original and cajun. I find Italian bland.  For batter I'll usually get clubhouse, panko or scratch."
284948,richyb,2008-12-29 01:18:00,774,cajun 3 nights ago .... italian lastnight ...    for my back up plan if i run out  i go to the flour and seasoning salt mixture ...  or dads old mixture of dip in egg and then into crushed crackers ....
284949,Silo Buster,2008-12-29 01:19:00,81,"Garlic and Butter flavour fish crisp for me.  Cronzy's is good too,but a lil on the salty side.     Damn it now Im hungry for some eye fillets"
284950,crappieperchhunter,2008-12-29 01:24:00,2582,Tried them all... original is still my favourite. The only one I don't like is Cajun. I like spicy stuff... just not on freshwater fish. The cajun is good on pork chops though.
284970,brifishrgy,2008-12-29 02:13:00,559,original my fav for fish .. dont use egg or milk ....just coat the wet fillets ... i also like the beer batter for onion rings
285002,BUSTER,2008-12-29 03:09:00,1336,"well i have 4 fillets , i may try them all!     anyone ever try crushing their favorite bag of chips say BBQ ruffles or sour crean and onion chips?     i might try the fruitloops  , kids will think iam nuts , but then again the 5 yr old just might eat the fish!"
285009,bigugli,2008-12-29 03:31:00,6138,"My Gram would use crushed potato chips as a crumble topping on all sorts of baked dishes.  Would work well on fish dipped in an egg and milk wash. So do cornflakes, bran flakes and rice crispies."
285011,Handlebarz,2008-12-29 03:35:00,3790,Hey Brad I forget the name of the stuff but a guy in Sudbury makes his own coating and sells it the guys here love it and buy it by the case from him he just sends it down here. Check Ramikos they might know who I am talking about if I find the name I will send it to ya but for now I draw a blank.
285019,walleyemen,2008-12-29 04:12:00,316,"i love the garlic and butter and the cajjun.. emmmmm gooood!, not just for fish , try it on anything, great stuff, never go camping without it!"
285021,Grimace,2008-12-29 04:14:00,2020,Fish crisp rules.   So does Chronzey's stuff.
285056,outllaw,2008-12-29 11:49:00,1232,i love fish crisp . problem is i wish it came in bigger boxes. doing muskies requires lots.
285083,mbac31,2008-12-29 13:08:00,904,  Thats going to stir things up.
285093,Mike Pike,2008-12-29 13:47:00,1332,"Original is my absolute favorite.  So easy and simple, just coat wet fillets with it and you're done.  Now for DEEP frying, I'd encourage anyone to try the Beer Batter.  Again, really simple, just the product mixed with a little beer and it's done.  When deep frying, remember to pat the fillets as dry as possible first and that way the batter sticks to the fillets.  Oil has to be nice and hot too.  Mmmmmmmmmm"
285119,bbog,2008-12-29 15:19:00,665,Original and Cajun are the BEST! When out I have been know to used crushed BBQ chips. Making me hungry thinking about it.
285126,LeXXington,2008-12-29 15:43:00,1928,"I actually prefer Chronzey's stuff, but Fishcrisp Beer batter is excellent..  NOW if you want really good batter!! TJ's is still my all time fav.."
285152,luv2drift,2008-12-29 16:44:00,147,fish crisp...beer batter
