284995,douG,2008-12-29 02:52:00,2693,"    This was my first try at home baked bread.  Anyone else silly enough to do this?  As you can see, half the first loaf disappeared in 5 minutes, the verdict was, 'Keep at it Dad, you'll figger it out'."
285000,Joey,2008-12-29 03:04:00,9122,"Yes, I made onion dill bread today to go with my lobster bisque.  Twas delicious.  Yours looks pretty good DouG.  Its nice when its fresh out of the oven and the butter just melts on it  Joey"
285001,bigugli,2008-12-29 03:04:00,6138,Every once in a while I get the hankering for home cooked.  Almost looks like potato bread or sourdough.
285004,sturgman,2008-12-29 03:16:00,249,Looks yummy Doug.. I made bannock today and it was delicious with some fried eggs and bacon
285024,douG,2008-12-29 04:19:00,2693,"BigUgli,  The recipe starts the day before, for a coupla hours on the counter, then overnight in the fridge.  The long rise makes it sweet and chewy, and the steam tray in the oven makes the crust cripsy, with a nice poof pumping up the bubbles."
285028,bigugli,2008-12-29 04:31:00,6138,Gotta have that steam else any bread stays soft. if its pulla no steam wanted.
285032,wuchikubo,2008-12-29 05:09:00,1114,"Well, it doesn't look too bad in the pics. How was the taste and texture?"
285033,douG,2008-12-29 05:12:00,2693,"Nissu is nice, cardomom rules."
285069,TroutnMuskieHunter,2008-12-29 12:37:00,1362,Have you got a recipe to share with us Doug???....I'm the chef here at home and would like to try baking some bread while I'm waiting for the river to freeze up again...
285072,motv8tr,2008-12-29 12:47:00,2587,I cheat and use a Bread making machine  Maureen
285082,Big Cliff,2008-12-29 13:03:00,6899,"I use the bread making machine but just put it on the dough setting. It mixes and kneeds the bread for me, takes 2 hours.  Then I remove it from the machine and kneed it again adding just enough flour to make it workable. I then shape it into rolls or loafs or whatever I want and place it on a baking sheet and pop it in the oven with the light on for about an hour to let it rise again.  last step, bake at about 375 for (about 12 minutes for rolls, 22-25 minutes for loafs). You can use the ""pan of water"" if you want crusty or do as I do, I just use a spray bottle and mist it a couple of times while it is baking, that way I can do soft and crusty both at the same time.  Turn it out onto a wire rack to cool and you are done."
285094,crappieperchhunter,2008-12-29 13:53:00,2582," I was wondering if that was the no knead recipe when I saw the pictures. I have been thinking of trying it . What did you but it in for it's time in the oven? The recipes I saw called for a dutch oven which we don't have, which is why I have not tried doing it yet.  It looks great. I know it would not last past one meal at our place. Debbe especially loves fresh bread."
285098,douG,2008-12-29 14:19:00,2693,"Next time, I will try the following:  warmer water in the final mix, smaller loaves (three, not two from the batch), a longer rise in the loaf shape, and a cooler oven for the baking.  I am shooting for a rustic style loaf, chewy texture, with big bubbles and a crisp crust.  This recipe uses a lot of water, so the dough is very sticky.  I kneaded it in a bowl with a wet hand, rather than on a floured surface.  I  just cooked it on a cookie sheet, lined with parchment and coated with corn meal.  This is the recipe from the book I got from my sister for Christmas.  She also gave me a kitchen scale which helps a lot with the measuring.  Give it a try.  It takes some planning since the making goes over two days, but the taste is worth it."
285175,TroutnMuskieHunter,2008-12-29 17:43:00,1362,Thanks Doug!!  ....not sure when I'm going to try the recipe out but I'll definately report back when I do!!
