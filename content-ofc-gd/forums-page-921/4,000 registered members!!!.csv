282622,Greencoachdog,2008-12-22 01:22:00,8163,"Don't want to rain on your parade Bossman, but 83 members online is only slightly more than 2 %... how can we get more members online at one time?  ... maybe it's time to clean out the dead files?"
282632,TJQ,2008-12-22 01:40:00,7806, NEVER!!!  LOL...
282644,Roy,2008-12-22 01:49:00,13728,Dead files are cleaned out regularly.
282655,Greencoachdog,2008-12-22 02:07:00,8163," Yeah, but regularly could be as seldom as once a century if we're talkin' milleniums! (just as short time nfor you bubba roy...)   It's just seems like there'd be more than 2-3% of the members online at peak times to me though though."
285543,crabbs,2008-12-30 12:52:00,14,ahemm   it's me crabbs  Wow thats really cool whos says being last it never good!! I am a member of a few boards and I just joined this one as it looks truly awesome.  My first favourite is hunting..then icefishing then finally soft water fishing.  I am from Oshawa  I have a hunting camp called crabbs camp.  No I don't have crabbs and never had that or any other std ..yuck.  I have a beautiful wife and 3 lovely daughters which I am very proud of so watch your your self or I'll kick your ass    I can give it pretty good so a little class is always welcome but if your in a race to the bottom please just pass on by and keep going on your choosen path.  I got the nick name frome my girls because I can get crabby at times but the scripts seem to be working and generally speaking I am a pretty good guy    I live for the great out doors and make no apoligies for that.  I enjoy meeting new people who like me always give a little more than they recieve.  Hope to be here for a while and look forward to joining the community....hows that...can I have my shirt and hat now..    lol
