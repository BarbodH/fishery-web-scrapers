284973,Skud,2008-12-29 02:16:00,739,Scaried up this doe and a few others today walking around at my Dad's place. Seen a young Coyote and a bunch of Turkeys too. Windy but a nice day in the woods. 
284981,bigugli,2008-12-29 02:22:00,6138,It's just amazing what you will come across when going for a peaceful walk.  Of course the wind helps to muffle any noise you may be making.
284983,Leecher,2008-12-29 02:26:00,7832,That's a great shot Skud  She looks like she's not sure if she should remain or scram out of there... your presence sure got her attention Good job on the cam  Thanks for sharing Leechman
