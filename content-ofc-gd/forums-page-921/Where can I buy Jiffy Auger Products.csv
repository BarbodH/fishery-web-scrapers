285096,Fisherman,2008-12-29 14:00:00,7201,"Where did you buy the auger? go check there, otherwise, go to Lebaron in Ottawa, as for oil, go and get any synthetic at Canadian Tire, jeez, I know Jiffy brand peanut better might be hard to mix..."
285304,joco,2008-12-29 23:07:00,57,I gotmy hats and oil frome there web site direcly..but ask them to go true reg post not that other ones.....  .  that little jiffy oil is great...the little conterner is the perfect size.   good luck  joco
285307,joco,2008-12-29 23:08:00,57,sorry actualy the oil i go it frome bass pro shop in watertown/US..  :wallbash:   just the hats are frome there site.  joco
285338,Whitespinnerbait,2008-12-30 00:03:00,2038,"Thanks Fisherman went to Lebaron's ,,They had blades for my auger and yes in stock , for the oil what i'm looking for is the synthetic 40to1 smokless jiffy brand ...Man that stuff is great    Joco my Man .....   Long time no Hear ...I see you went fishing to day Nice little report   We should all meet on the ice soon"
285363,Fisherman,2008-12-30 00:41:00,7201,"Do your wallet a favour and go to your local Canadian Tire, go to the oil section and get a litre of AMSOIL  100% 100:1 premix, about $9.00,  if you can use all that oil in the next couple years in your ice auger then you have drilled enough holes to drain the Atlantic.  You can mix that stuff at 80:1 in your auger and still have lots of lube and no fouling.  Jiffy Lube is just another cheap rebranded oil."
285386,irishfield,2008-12-30 01:06:00,26272,"I just use the same 50:1 gas that I have from my Stihl chainsaw and Husqvarna power broom in my auger. Not gonna mix another ""batch""  of fuel around here. Works fine. Like Fisherman says... Jiffy doesn't own an oil business."
285391,misfish,2008-12-30 01:20:00,29133," Are you sure about that,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, cause the gas prices sure fell like a jiffy. LOL   If you really want the jiffy oil,you can get it wal mart. I would go with the pros here."
285510,buckster,2008-12-30 05:55:00,530,Id go with the AMSOIL its a far better product then the jiffy oil.  I did get some strikemaster oil at bps it was on clearence for 99cents cant go wrong at that price and one bottle does 1 gallon of gas.
285575,TroutnMuskieHunter,2008-12-30 15:16:00,1362,So...are you guys saying that my 9yr old Jiffy 30 that uses 24:1 oil/gas ratio can now use a 50:1 mixture by going to synthetic?????????
285643,Whitespinnerbait,2008-12-30 17:14:00,2038,"Steve i've been running mine 50 to 1 ,,Maybe that's why its smokeless"
285649,TroutnMuskieHunter,2008-12-30 17:23:00,1362,"Paul,  I've already ""popped"" a piston...even though it cost $70 to repair it...no thanks...I can put up with a bit of smoke...what I couldn't put up with was the downtime waiting for the parts to get ordered and delivered..."
285662,Fisherman,2008-12-30 17:48:00,7201,"I bought my Jiffy 30 in 1991, 17 years, it's been running on no richer than 50:1 synthetic, only changed the spark plug once."
285733,wallyboss,2008-12-30 20:17:00,1095,"It is supposed to be 24:1, but I have been using the small oil bottles from Jiffy and if you calculate it makes it 40:1.  I ahve read that one AMSOIL product you can even go to 100:1.  But I think, I'll stick to the small Jiffy oil bottles. No measuring needed 1 bottle with 1 gallon of gas .  Whitespinner if you find a place around that sells it let me know."
285754,irishfield,2008-12-30 21:28:00,26272,My Jiffy bought last year states 40:1. The good 50:1 Stihl oil I use in my chainsaw isn't gonna make any difference.
285762,Sinker,2008-12-30 21:46:00,8692,"Geeze, some guys get really caught up in thier oils huh?  Any 2 stroke oil is fine. Jiffy's will burn it....no worries. If I told you some of the stuff I've put thru mine, you would prolly have a heart attack!!  Anything from my 50:1 leftover boat fuel, to 100:1 amsoil mix. After 20 yrs, the auger is still going strong.  Sinker"
