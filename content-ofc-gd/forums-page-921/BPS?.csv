285498,bpsbassman,2008-12-30 05:08:00,941,"Good Day! Well I haven't been around here much lately, retirement has been taking up too much time (guess I surfed more at work than I realized). I came home on Sunday night after two ""Gong Show"" days at BPS.  The parking lot and the store were absolute chaos! I thought that I would sit back and relax and decided to check the board and immediately came across this thread.  Needless to say that I went to bed extremely pi$$ed off and frustrated. Marcus you have every right to be upset and you should have gone to see the MOD (Manager On Duty). What I find extremely frustrating though, is knowing of the dedication of my fellow fishing associates.  Crap happens sometimes, but I have a lot of respect for their knowledge and work ethic. We have somewhere in the neighbourhood of 30,000 skus in the fishing dept alone and it is a challenge to know where everything is (especially when they move around sometimes) and also to be an ""EXPERT"" in all fishing disciplines from fishing for bass, walleye, Musky, Pike, Perch, Salmon, Trout, Carp and yes even swordfish, 'cuda and what ever anyone else is targeting.  Also Ice Fishing (which I am totally ignorant of (sorry) and Float Fishing which I tried for the first time this fall. I apologize to those that feel we should know everything.  Crap, I learn stuff from customers all the time! Its funny though, that every time one of these posts shows up, its the same two or three that come out of the wood work to bash the store. I have seen so many associates delay their lunch, miss breaks and even stay over half an hour (unpaid) after their shift to ensure a customer is satisfied that these kinds of threads really pi$$ me off. I too support local tackle shops (and drop too much money in there as well), but have also been ignored in some of them while the local ""Good Ole Boy's Club"" gathers in the corner.  Such is life. If you think you're getting poor service you need to speak up and be heard by the MOD.  BPS stresses Customer Service in all their training.  You can't fix what you don't know about. Have a Good Day! Signed, A Dumb Ass BPS employee."
285527,Roy,2008-12-30 10:03:00,13728," I feel your pain Roger. I know how dedicated a man you are to whatever endeavour you undertake. Whether it be work, family, fishing, music or whatever. Bass Pro Shops is a very large and well run organization. You and I are both old enough to know that the bigger you are, the more often you'll be criticized....rightly or wrongly. I don't go to the BPS Vaughan store very often because it's really quite a distance for me. The times that I HAVE been there, I have always been impressed by the service. But then again, in all the years that I've been dealing with the public, I honestly cannot remember ever being ill-treated by any retailer. It might boil down to attitude. Anyhow, you have a great day Roger and remember what Tennessee Guy posted."
285531,kentooley,2008-12-30 11:41:00,208,"I've had more good experiences than bad at the Vaughn store. When it comes to bass fishing, I don't like the fact that they don't carry my favorite tubes,(I get them at Lebaron), I don't like when the sales guy hasn't a clue about rattles and how to use them. I don't like standing there like a stooge as sales people walk past me and don't offer help. I was beginning to think it was a ploy to get me to wander around and spend more $$$. Then it struck me, BASS FISHERMAN ARE STUPID!!!. So they hire people to service stupid people. So I wait for bad advice , drop $100.00 on lures that haven't caught me squat. At this point I've already exchanged my basket  for a cart. Thank God for those things that give money on command.  The guys in the fly shop on the other hand are polite,  give you the time of day, and make you feel like a somebody. Then I looked at the prices on those Simms because they didn't have the Orvis waders in my size and I bought a pair of fleece gloves instead. Gotta tell you though, this gentleman in the flyshop steered me to the other side of the store and I bought a pair of breathable waders that I've worn for the last 2 seasons.  On my way out, I got treated like royalty and felt like it to.  Hat's off to most of the people that represent BPS.  I like the place .  PS I've been drinking all night."
285546,OhioFisherman,2008-12-30 13:06:00,6623,"The only one I have been to is the one in Auburn Hills Mi. and it`s been about 4 years ago now since the last trip there. Never had a problem there or with Cabela`s in Dundee Mi.  Different for me though, a geezer, fishing only, I know what I want when I get there so don`t need help."
285153,Radnine,2008-12-29 16:44:00,1538,"I have a bit of a different take on BPS. Going to BPS is like going on holiday to me, I just love to walk around and look at stuff. I live an hour and a bit away so that there really is no such thing as a deal because the minute I pull into the lot I have spent more money on gas than I am likely to save. Reading this post through, I have seen every one of the behaviours that have been mentioned here (good and bad). However, it is hard for me to get mad at employees for wanting to chat (be it with each other, or other customers) when I know that I would want to do the same thing (pay or no pay). And unlike Marcus, I am a 46 year old that is unlikely to be put upon or stand about waiting for bad service. To let the employees of the store ruin my visit would be like not having a good time at the fair because the guy running a ride has bad teeth. Jim"
285163,bigugli,2008-12-29 17:17:00,6138," Got to love it  . Great explanation. I live just over an hour away as well.  I love going to BPS for all the ""candy"", then run up the road a bit to do a little shore fishing."

BPS,ZELLERS,WAL-MART,HOME DE-POT,They are all there the same thing. People working doing thier job. Should we expect more,I dont know,yes, maybe,but it takes special people to love thier job for the wage thier making. I know if I was one looking for a job,a hunting/fishing store ,would be my first choice,but I know the wage would not servise. Myself I know what I am looking for. I look and look then ask. If they dont know,well,I just look more. Sure I get ticked,but hey,what can you do(just like my bro says) What can ya do.  It,s easy to beat up the little people,maybe a letter to the main office ,explaining what you feel they can do to improve.  Enough said."

My only beef with BPS, I bought a BAITCAST NET and had no idea it was ILLEGAL in ONTARIO - So, why would BPS sell such an item, if its ILLEGAL in the COUNTRY they're in?! Anyway, I've gone there a couple of times and have had nothing but POSITIVE EXPERIENCE.  I guess, overall - SUPPORT LOCAL CANADIAN BUSINESS'. I try to stick with LOCAL BUSINESS guys (IE: JB's Fishing Depot, LeBaron etc...) If BPS has something for CHEAP in comparison to the local business', I'd ask them if they do a 'Price Comparison' (BPS does a price match with LeBaron; and Vice Versa) and go with whomever is cheaper.  My 2 cents..."

285042,waterwolf,2008-12-29 06:53:00,556,"i feel for you marcus,, that level of service shouldn't happen at a business of that calibre. if i had the time ,, i'd love to work at bps , for a few reasons , one of which is to help those who have questions much like yours . getting help purchasing a gift for grandad shouldn't  be so difficult. i've had some really great experiences with bps staff,, but there have also been a few uglies . overall they'll still get the bulk of my outdoors dollars ,,great sales,,. huge inventory."
285043,Guest skeeter99,2008-12-29 07:44:00,0,"there employees and service suck period  the only time there is anyone knowledgable in the store is during there fishing sales when the tackle reps are in the the store  they know where the products in the store  better than the employees absolute joke!!!!  and yes when something is on sale forget going to get it first day buy it ahead of time and go back and get the difference when on sale so you can guarantee you will get one  they are like zellers  ""were the lowest stock is the law, everyday""   yes they do have stuff at times better than the local price  but last time I was there I was looking into buyin a humingbird sideview and know one was at the electronics counter for 43 mins yes 43 mins even after someone was paged  and the unit is $1147.69 and when the guy showed up he was laughing and giggling and of course the secret conversation with the other employee   I said screw this I will buy the unit local even though it is about $100 more I just cant stand the guys in there  there I am done I FEEEEEEEELLLLLLL much better now LOL!!!!"
285046,SlowPoke,2008-12-29 09:33:00,2984,"I have not always enjoyed great service at BPS Vaughn but I'm glad they are there. Even our favourite hometown/smalltown/Ma & Pop tackle shop can disappoint us from time to time. They get slagged on here because everybody feels the need to post a bad experiance. Perhaps we set our expectations too high? Consider this, BPS Vaughn sees more customers in one day than your local shop might see in a year. I'd suggest that the overwhelming majority is very happy. The silent majority. Cudos to BPS for everything they do in the community, for kids and their product selection. -Brian"
285068,Greencoachdog,2008-12-29 12:33:00,8163," Have you ever known me to be any other way???  ... but actually I'm not tryin' to be offensive. I've lived in a household with a retail sales income and it's tough!!! I'm not talking about the ""part-timers"", I'm talking about the 40 hr. week employees.  No offense to retail sales employees intended!... but they have a high turn over ratio (because of the low wage) and will hire just about anyone, and the training is usually minimal (because of the high turnover ratio).  Does Marcus' shopping experience sound like he was dealing with well trained employees to you forrest?  Ask Al Bundy how much he makes selling womens shoes!"
285081,hawkeye,2008-12-29 13:01:00,162,"yea, but Al Bundy has a hottie for a wife  Seriously I have been to BPS many times, and what little I asked the staff they were helpful. My gripes concern the fact that you have to tour the entire lure section to find anything, like Erie Dearies. They seem to have tons and tons of some things and none of others. I too have had problems getting waited on at the electronics counter, seems the staff there is more interested in gabbing with each other  and NF they got rid of the golf dept"
285089,forrest,2008-12-29 13:36:00,1032,"     Training as in being obedient to what the store wants them to do or training as in knowledge?  From Marcus's story I can't tell either way.  1) It was during the busy Christmas season, employees get borrowed from other departments or hired new for Christmas help.  2) The first employee did the right thing by sending the person over to the 2nd.  Maybe it would have been better to walk them over; I was not there.  What he did was much better than faking it or guessing.  3) The second employee was going on break.  A break they are entitled too.  Who knows how long they were on the floor.  In my retail experience a lot of guys stayed on the floor way too long and often took breaks hours after they were scheduled.  Management started enforcing people leaving the floor for breaks.  4) This last guy may have had less of a clue about the department (cashier, christmas help?) and unknowningly sent them back to the first guy.  He assumed that all BPS employees are experts in the departments they stand in.  Maybe the blame lies with the management, Christmas or a busy store.  There is not enough info to reach a conclusion on what happened.  forrest"
285091,Greencoachdog,2008-12-29 13:37:00,8163,"  Yeah, but Al got Peg by making 4 touchdowns in a single game... not by selling womens shoes!  ... so a fat lady came into the shoe store today..."
285107,mikeh,2008-12-29 14:57:00,824,"I think Marcus did get good advice in the end, as buying a gift card was probably the way to go. As for the service at BPS I can only comment on the fishing departmnt as I don't go to the hunting section. I've never had a problem finding someone in the fishing department, they usually have lots of staff to serve people, I think all of them are involved in the sport which is very important and have had a few discussions with some of them regarding different lakes. There are a few of the salespeople that if they are not busy will approach you in the aisle to see if you need help finding anything which I think is great customer service. Overall I've never had a bad experience in the fishing department , although sometimes you can find things cheaper somewhere else or maybe they don't stock a lure I'm looking for, but I think overall they have a great selection.  The lack of stock issues sometimes are maybe caused by the amount of people that go thru the store and the amount of merchandise they move , plus the fact that ALL the BPS stores are probably re-stocking from the same place. I have gone into the store looking for a certain colour in plastics and it seems like someone bought the last 10 packages trying to stock up for their fishing season and I usually end up getting something else in the colour I want.  I would say I go to BPS about once a month and usually don't spend much money there, but I enjoy looking for new items they are selling, as they seem to bring in new stuff into the fishing department alot."
