I am going to be heading up that way in a couple weeks to do some fishing just wondering if you guys could help me with a camp ground. I have been to Emily Provincial Park and didn't care for it. Any help would be great.  Thanks Chris"

My linkhttp://www.parkbridge.ca/prop/cottagerv/goreskislanding/home.aspx  Google Map  We stayed there once a couple of years back. The transient sites are on the small side but they are right on the water (the channel for the park). The park has a couple heated pools that are nice and a small water park. It's not the best park but I would stay there again. Besides, it is the only one on Scugog.  They also rent boats for an OK price or there is a boat launch right on site and you can tie up right next to your campsite.  The kids fished non stop in the channel and hammered the pan fish!"
