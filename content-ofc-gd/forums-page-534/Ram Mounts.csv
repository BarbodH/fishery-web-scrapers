Now the combination of a weak bow plate, and the flexible shaft, has the head of my motor bouncing around quite a bit. I've seen on tv that there is a mount that can be added in between the shaft and your gunnel to prevent this bounce. However I am unable to locate this item anywhere. The standard stabalizer kits are inadequate to my needs.  Can anyone direct me somewhere where these are available. Or even better yet, an easy Do it Yourself solution to my problem.  Thanks"

587258,The Urban Fisherman,2011-05-27 17:07:00,2050,Have you tried RAM's actual website?  I ordered a bunch of stuff directly from them last year.  You just use a ram mount from them that allows you to screw or bolt the mount to the deck of your boat and to the motor.

587294,irishfield,2011-05-27 18:31:00,26272,Let me find a picture... considering I have a 70 inch shaft I had to do something!  2 U bolt mount balls and a universal joiner.  Edit.. found a shot with it in it... I know I have a better one somewhere but need to get back to work in the hangar!
