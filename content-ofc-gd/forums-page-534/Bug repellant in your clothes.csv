587253,Joey,2011-05-27 16:52:00,9122,"Columbia sent me an email that said ""Say Goodbye to Your Little Friend""  Anyone tried this yet?  If so, how was it?  Here's the link:  Columbia Bug Repellant Clothes"
587255,Roy,2011-05-27 16:59:00,13728,"The ad is good. People with short sleeves, skirts, no socks, nothing on their necks or faces.....BUT they have bug repellent T-shirts and shorts.  I'm sure someone won't notice that though and load up on the schmata....unbelievable."
587262,jimmer,2011-05-27 17:16:00,2730,"If there is a piece of skin exposed that doesn't have repellant on it, it will get chewed no matter we wear. Leave it to Columbia to come out with a line of repellant clothing. I'm with Roy on this."
587264,Joey,2011-05-27 17:20:00,9122," Ya, I noticed that Roy, too funny"
587267,bigbuck,2011-05-27 17:23:00,2449,"Ahhh, the Marketing machine at work. I'd love to see a Columbia exec go out in the outdoors where the black flies and mosquitoes roam with just these clothes and no other repellants on him/her."
587269,kickingfrog,2011-05-27 17:24:00,8333,Tightly woven nylon clothing.    It's the only way I could have stayed sane for 6 weeks in the Arctic summer. I need to dig out the photo where is looks like I have a fur shirt.
587275,adempsey,2011-05-27 17:30:00,1498,"I keep reading a lot of good things about Thermacell and that uses a synthetic analog of the natural repellent pyrethrin from chrysanthemums as well.  So, perhaps the Columbia clothes are ""wearable Thermacells"" and it forms a ""repellent"" barrier around you?  Beats me.  Would be interesting to see some reviews."
