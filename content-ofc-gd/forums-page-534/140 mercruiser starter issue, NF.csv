When I replaced my started, the #s on the old one matched up at the auto supply shop and they had one in stock . Great I took it and cheap, not thinking at the time, that some put an automotive one in . Now here is where it gets interesting. I pulled the 2yr old starter out an the housing is cracked, great, no problem! So I googled my engine for a starter # Then I went to double check the teeth on the gear. On most sites the advertised an 11 tooth but I counted mine its a 9 tooth Could this have caused it to crack? I dont have the formula in front of me and I know I have counted the ring gear teeth and wrote it down somewhere, just in case 3 yrs ago. From what I do recall the serial # starts with a 3. Which makes it an earliar model engine. For about a decade that engine uses the same starter. One short and one long bolt. Thanks in advance V"

587450,Twocoda,2011-05-28 03:58:00,4130,Vinni make sure you have the extra bracket installed ....two bolts as you mentioned then on the other end of the starter there is another bracket that gets secured right to the block...Just thinking out loud..hope it helps

But from what i got from my friend who use to be in the marine repair there is not a a big difference between a car starter and a marine. if i remembered properly a merc is a GM motor "
