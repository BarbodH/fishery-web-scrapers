587153,hawk-eye,2011-05-27 10:18:00,141,How do you go about anchoring your boat in 80' of water? I'm gonna go out and giver a try and I am concernd my anchor will not cut it.
587155,Billy Bob,2011-05-27 10:23:00,5865," You need LOTS of rope....80 feet would be at least 240 feet of rope for a decent angle....much more if it's a rough day.  Also I have about 3' of 1/2"" chain on my anchor then the rope.....I have't had to anchor in 80' but many times in 70+ feet on Lake Erie when the perch go deep late in the summer."

587179,Guest gbfisher,2011-05-27 12:28:00,0,Buy yourself a good Sea Anchor big enough for the boat you are in and 150' of good rope. You can add a few feet of chain or you can add another smaller anchor up the rope and go with that in a strong wind.
