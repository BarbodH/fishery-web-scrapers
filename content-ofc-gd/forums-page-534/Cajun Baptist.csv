Reverend Boudreaux was the part-time pastor of the local Cajun Baptist Church and Pastor Thibodaux was the minister of the Covenant Church across the road. They were both standing by the road, pounding a sign into the ground that read:  'Da End is Near Turn Yo Sef 'Roun Now Afore It Be Too Late!'  As a car sped past them, the driver leaned out his window and yelled, 'You religious nuts!'  From the curve they heard screeching tires, and a big splash...  Boudreaux turns to Thib and asks 'Do ya tink maybe da sign should jussay.....'Bridge Out?'"
