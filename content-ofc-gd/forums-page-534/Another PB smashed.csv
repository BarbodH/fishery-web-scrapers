586953,SRT8 smoker craft,2011-05-26 20:17:00,1107,I went out to try for some creek browns but the river was like a double double    so I headed to a local resivior and tried for some WGSF and mabye a big resi brown well I caught a whack of these.    but The new PB was on the first cast on a chartreuse power minnow on a dropshot rig works awesome for panfish and trout this is not what I expected to see after the scrap this thing put up.  
586963,The Urban Fisherman,2011-05-26 20:44:00,2050,nice gill brother! I've been trying to decided if I want to take the kids out for panfish on the bay or at the reservoir tomorrow night! this makes me want to go slay some gilllzzz!  Good work!
586964,SRT8 smoker craft,2011-05-26 20:47:00,1107,Yeah I was shore bound too so I would have caught a tonne if I was in a boat I need a pontoon or a old 12' tinnie to leave there all year.
586965,mercman,2011-05-26 20:50:00,7054,Shoulda got a Princecraft Shawn Ya mite a got some of these 
586983,danbouck,2011-05-26 21:39:00,4380,But that's a baby merc!  Nice job Shawn
586999,SRT8 smoker craft,2011-05-26 22:16:00,1107, I don't know Paul I really like my lund and I really prefer these over that little baby perch       
587004,BFSC Kevin,2011-05-26 22:21:00,1351,If Lunds catch larger perch than Princecrafts than I'm sure glad I got a Lund.
587007,SRT8 smoker craft,2011-05-26 22:26:00,1107,Boats don't catch fish but they can make you a LOT more comfy while you do
587011,ehg,2011-05-26 22:29:00,2666,A while back i ended up catching my personal best WGSF on the Saugeen while targeting brookies. Catching your biggest panfish when trying for trout is something to remember. At least you will remember your PB panfishes this way.
