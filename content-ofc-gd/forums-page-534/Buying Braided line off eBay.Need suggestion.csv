I find with out seeing it and touching it, it's hard to decide. Lots of stuff is made in china and they relabel it as a new product to make more money. For all we know that can be some power pro relabeled."
587272,bigbuck,2011-05-27 17:26:00,2449,I'd stay away. Who knows what sort of quality controls are in place or not. I'd pay extra knowing that it is coming from a reputable manufacturer.

587283,adempsey,2011-05-27 17:39:00,1498,Try it out. Buy the 100M spool for $6.50 and see how it goes.
587287,Bondar,2011-05-27 17:47:00,817,"would make for cheap backing on a centerpin or fly reel......  its the same diameter as power pro in the same pound test , but as you likely know  "" YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR""  good luck"
