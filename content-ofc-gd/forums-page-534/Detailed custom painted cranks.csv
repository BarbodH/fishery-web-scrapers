586085,redskullz,2011-05-24 04:49:00,55,"This round of custom painted lures i wanted to give the fish some colour schemes they have never seen before. SO armed with some Krylon spraypaints, a roll of grid drywall tape, and some painters tape i went to work. I cant wait to get these coated with envirotex and try them out!! I find its much easier to get quality pics before coating the lures with the near mirror like envirotex topcoat. As i was looking at the lures i thought up some amusing names for the different paintjobs.(yeah, yeah small things amuse small minds...lol)    Green Gridded Bass (southern toxic version)  Ingredients:  Undercoat- Colour Place white 3 coats  Basecoat- Flourescent Green  Belly Overcoat- Colour Place White  Back Overcoat- Colour Place Black  Side Overcoat- Krylon Silver        RedBacked Running Rudder  Ingredients:  Undercoat- Colour Place white 3 coat  Basecoat- Krylon Silver  Belly Overcoat- Colour Place White  Back Overcoat Stage 1- Krylon Ruddy Brown  Back overcoat Stage 2- Colour Place Black  Side Overcoat- Krylon Yellow            Citrus Scotsman  Ingredients:  Undercoat- Colour PLace White 3 coats  Basecoat- Krylon Yellow  Belly Overcoat- White  Back Overcoat- Colour Place Black  Grid Side Overcoat Stage 1- Yellow  Grid Side Overcoat Stage 2- Flourescent Blaze Orange          Bee 52 Bomber  Undercoat- Colour Place White 3 coats  Basecoat- Krylon Yellow  Bee Stripes and Back Overcoat- Colour Place Black  Belly Overcoat- Krylon Yellow            Wow were these fun to paint!!
