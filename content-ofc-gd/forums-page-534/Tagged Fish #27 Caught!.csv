The lucky angler caught the Rice Lake Fishing Festival tagged prize fish #27, to win a $500 prize package from DENNIS SAVERY'S REMAX EASTERN REALTY. The prize sunfish was caught off a dock in Bewdley this afternoon and she checked in to BJ Tackle to claim her prize.   That's two prize fish claimed in the festival so far and both by the ladies. Come on guys time to stepped and catch your tagged prize.  Don't forget all the great draw prizes you are entered into by getting your button.
