587009,Moosebunk,2011-05-26 22:27:00,3970," Ahhhh, they're all from photoshop land after much arm extension.  Pretty slick how they look so big and real!"
587040,irishfield,2011-05-26 23:42:00,26272,"So now that I've had time to sit down and enjoy it my friend.... looks like the girls are really enjoying their new environment. Those smiles tell tales that need no words. Great to see they're happy in the transition from the Factory.  The fish... what can I say, maybe I need to go back ""home"" and join you for a day or five!"
587042,Moosebunk,2011-05-26 23:44:00,3970,You & Leah are always welcome here Wayne.
587045,irishfield,2011-05-26 23:50:00,26272,Leah more so than me.. but I know what you're saying and thanks!
587053,ehg,2011-05-27 00:22:00,2666,Nice PB gar and bunch of crappies. This southern Ontario life seems to be treating you well with new toys and fish species etc... mainly your kids seem to be enjoying and flourishing in it. Great photos and write up per usual Thanks for posting this!
586747,Moosebunk,2011-05-26 03:56:00,3970,"Spring fishing has been in full flow for the last six weeks and I've been drowning myself in it.   Around home there was a bit of a wait between the last ice outings and finally swinging some long-rod casts from the big boat.  To pass that time a little exploring through the local backyard was done.  The kids were totally game and had a blast.            That journey on land was complimented a week later when I soaked the WarCanoe on the nearby Mississippi, Clyde, Fall and Mud Rivers.  A truly remarkable day cruising high on spring runoff and peering around many new corners of highland waterways.                What would be spring without trout?  Well... ""without"" was almost the key word for describing trout this spring.  Despite a couple tough ATV trips into the Madawaska Hills in search of specks and bows, it was a day of lakers in The Bomber that saved face.              RJ and Slop are two guys who know their crappies, and so thankfully spending some time on the water with them helped me put some of these slabs into the boat.  A couple solo efforts and a couple more with family capped things off.  Watching floats drop can be addictive.  No 14 inchers this spring but a good number of 12 to 13.5's.              After craps... and kinda during, the gar fishing warmed up in these parts.  This is a really gnarly fishery one can't help but enjoy.  RJ and I started things off and since then I've shared the boat with buddies Grant, Pat and Luke.  Everyone has been having a blast and most have been nailing new personal bests.    Luke's PB below @ 14lb, 6oz.      Grant's PB below @ 51 inches.    Some gar aren't all that wicked looking at all... but rather kinda sweet and innocent...      ... though some fish are meant to be punished then taken aboard to photograph.        Wished I had a tape at the time for this one below... long skinny fish @ 13lb, 6oz.          Below, this morning catch is a new PB for length at 50.5 inches.  Weight was solid @ 14lb, 2oz.     Next three shots below are of my new PB caught while fishing with my buddy Pat.  A little descriptive text helps highlight that moment.   A thorough Bomber struttin' had some gars look our way and some turn and run.  Setting that hook is the goal but laying chase is a good bit of fun too.  Patty and I were on the prowl when we both took notice of an absolute PIG of a gar... one of those rare FREAK gars that eat other gar.  She was quick though, and had both of us in a tail-spin after her.  A few ignored casts and she slipped away downtown into the deep brown.  Twenty minutes or so later we were trudging through some skinny muck when Patty put the cast to a quality fish in his sight.  Other side of the boat I saw a black silhouette of a good fish pretty close to me too.  I made my cast and not even really seeing the take, I just set quick on the hit.  Fish was all up in my face and showing zero respect in no time, but some Mojo Bass moves patented by the Saints of Croix allowed Patty to slip the net under this one.  ""THAT'S A FAT FISH!!!"" announced Patty.  Excited I answered, ""Dood, I'm thinking this is my PB.""    The fish was real relaxed in the boat... not all are.  Although it had a little bowel release on deck.  Patty held the tape at the fishes nose while I stretched it along to the tail... 50 inches.  Maybe my longest, maybe not, but it was the girth of this girl that had us in wonder.    CROCSOCKS, be thy name.  Patty watching on, I slipped the digi-scale under the gill-plate and around to the leathery soft flesh midline with belly.  Holding her snout, got her vertical, slowly and carefully released all tension until she hung calm, and watched the scale settle in at 16lbs, 7oz.  YEAH!!!  Just slammed my PB from the previous week by a hair more than 3 pounds.  That is just GARgantuan cool.    ""Awesome fish Bunk... but you know... that fish we saw earlier would have eaten this fish,"" expressed Patty.  There wasn't doubt in my mind that she was going back to the swim anyways, and Patty was dead-on-target.  Every now and again you see a real prehistoric mammoth gar swimming.  Personally, I have seen three, maybe four fish that made all others look extinct.  One fish for sure from last year still haunts me.  This one went back to the river with whole-hearted happiness.  She'll be even bigger next time too.    And so that's half of spring in a nutshell.  It's been quality fishing and days out with friends so far, hopefully that remains the case.  Enjoy the coming sun all."
