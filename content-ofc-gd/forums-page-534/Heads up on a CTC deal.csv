587052,GBW,2011-05-27 00:21:00,8460,"Hey all.  I got my flyer and on the front page is a Rapala knife on sale for $9.99.  and in your flyer there should be an ""open in store envelope type coupon"" to see what you won or get/got.  each one is $5.00 or better from the looks of it.  I have this knife and it is a real good knife, especially if you can get it for $4.99 when it's reg. $24.99!  Just in case anyone is in need of a new filet knife I figured I would let you know.  oh, the coupon is only good for the next 3 days.  Geoff  *edit*  PS, no I don't work there just a heads up."
587057,asdve23rveavwa,2011-05-27 00:24:00,2690,"The coupon is either $5 off purchase, or $5 at M&M's here...or if you are way luckier than me, a bbq or $5000 shopping spree at CTC."
587060,GBW,2011-05-27 00:32:00,8460,same here but I opened mine and it's $5.00 off at CTC.  I would guess 98.9% are that too.
587065,appleb,2011-05-27 00:52:00,6,Apparently you can use a flashlight to find out what prize you have.  Some discussion here... http://forums.redflagdeals.com/canadian-tire-flyer-27-05-02-06-trick-check-game-card-prizes-5-off-1042016/     
587068,ketchenany,2011-05-27 01:07:00,3229," I don't work there either (have very close connections) but being in the ad business not to many big prizes are found, ""Lost Leader"" comes to mind.  Get what you can when it's available, I called in for a gas mower when the price is right! LOL"
587071,GBW,2011-05-27 01:18:00,8460,"You need a very bright light as I just tried knowing what my ""prize"" was."
587081,fishindude,2011-05-27 01:42:00,220,$5 off Rapala cranks is even better
587086,GBW,2011-05-27 01:51:00,8460,or the new Live Target Lures...
587087,irishfield,2011-05-27 01:53:00,26272,Of course I did my CTC run today for aircraft parts...
587089,GBW,2011-05-27 02:01:00,8460,bring your bill and return and re-buy so you save.  the stores her do it.
587091,irishfield,2011-05-27 02:03:00,26272,"lol... I can't drive there and back for $5 in gas, let alone my time.  Then again.. I shawn the flashlight on my coupon and I have the $5000 grand prize, so I'd better make the trip tomorrow!"
587097,asdve23rveavwa,2011-05-27 02:36:00,2690,"According to my coupon, you are supposed to open it in front of a cashier.  Not sure how ""sticky"" they are on this rule?"
587100,irishfield,2011-05-27 02:44:00,26272,Very sticky... you open it ahead of time it's VOID !
587106,Joey,2011-05-27 02:53:00,9122,"Well from my experience, better get there early.  I swear they only carry 1 of the items they have on sale in each store."
587120,HTHM,2011-05-27 03:21:00,4082,CTC FOR AIRCRAFT PARTS!!!!????????????? I ain't flying with you...
587123,irishfield,2011-05-27 03:28:00,26272,Yah... I buy all my structural bolts there Albert !!
587124,ctdd2006,2011-05-27 03:28:00,531, ....and I thought that was only the case in our little northern stores! lol
587163,asdve23rveavwa,2011-05-27 11:10:00,2690, That's what I figured
587290,dsn,2011-05-27 18:11:00,1018,"  I was there this morning making payment on my card. When the  2 fellas infront of me were up. The first guy placed his items on the table and the cashier pulls out the scratch and save. She opens it and says... ""OH you get $5 bucks off.  The second person goes up.. She pulls out another scratch and save... Oh Your get $5 bucks off.  I open mined at home, and says I get $5 bucks off MM Meats? I don't even shop at M&M meats.  I guess you don't have to bring it to CT. They have all the $5 bucks off purchase prizes.   karper"
