587592,Ziki,2011-05-28 23:49:00,128,Just wondering if you guys think its worth my time to buy this 14' canoe from a friend for $200 and fix it up?  Just looking for someone who has restored a canoe before and can offer advice about time and $$ involved in restoration.  I am considering fixing it up and reselling it.  Thanks for any advice!  
587596,jjcanoe,2011-05-28 23:58:00,744,"what kind of work are you looking at doing to it? looks like it needs a new seat, maybe 2 if the webbing is toast on the other one, (take the old ones off and cut the new ones to size and re-attach them) does it need new gunwales or just a paint job? a bit hard to tell due to the small size of the pictures. If you buddy hasn't wrapped it around a rock before it might be worth picking it up, but you might want to price out the fix-up supplies you'll be needing first.  jjcanoe"

Is it light enough for you to carry by yourself?  Is it solid? That bottom looks flimsy, but, as jjcanoe says, the pics are a bit too low-res to make much of a judgement call.  I'd be hesitant myself, I've done several canoes, and this one, at first glance, may not be worth the effort.  It's always a tough decision when you find a fixer upper. Worst case scenario is you learn something by doing it, and sell it mid-summer."
