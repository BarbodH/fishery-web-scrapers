586551,NateFollmer,2011-05-25 17:45:00,19,Outdoor Life compiled their list of the 20 Best Anglers on the Planet. The list is filled with a very diverse angling background that covers many different styles and many different targeted species. Check it out: http://www.outdoorlife.com/photos/gallery/fishing/saltwater/inshore/2011/05/meet-20-best-anglers-planet  Pete Maina just so happens to be #4 on the list!
586554,Terry,2011-05-25 17:54:00,14456,"must be fake, I don't see Lloyd Daume of U & Me Guide Service"
586555,bow slayer,2011-05-25 17:56:00,1074,"21. Bowslayer   In all honesty most of these guys fish for one type of fish. I think the angler who can be diversified and be very successful at many types of fish would be a better angler IMHO.Wow and what a surprise no canadians on the list ,with more fresh water than anyone else i am sure we have a few who know how to and are pretty good,and with our multi species and 4 seasons would be very diversified."
586556,sconceptor,2011-05-25 17:57:00,146,I would think Dr. Ball should be on that list for obvious reasons......
586559,spinnerbaitking,2011-05-25 18:03:00,1622,  X2 SBK
586560,kickingfrog,2011-05-25 18:10:00,8333, An expert knows more and more about less and less.
586562,Grimace,2011-05-25 18:19:00,2020,I had no idea that Parsons was a dentist for 15 years.  I really like him and Kavajecz.  I was surprised Al Lindner was left off the list.
586566,fishindevil,2011-05-25 18:31:00,6254,"i agree it should be alot more diversified, but only a few of them fish in all different seasons,like parsons,mania,and 2 others...and yes al lindner should have been there for sure, cheers"
586567,lew,2011-05-25 18:34:00,12766, I find it kinda strange that every post you've made since joining this board has been about Pete Maina.  But maybe that's just me.
586587,Spiel,2011-05-25 19:24:00,9065,The best fisherman I've ever known have purposely/intentionally shunned the limelight.
586592,Dave Bailey,2011-05-25 19:34:00,1641, That's why I declined...
586595,dave524,2011-05-25 19:44:00,4508,"Freshwater, multi species , my vote would go to Al Linder  Now if I had the opportunity to share a river or a boat with a well known angler, being mostly a steelhead/salmon angler, my choice would be April Vokey   sorry Buzz"
586597,skinny,2011-05-25 19:45:00,442,well maybe next year I will make it
586601,Lip-ripper,2011-05-25 20:06:00,228,"lol, Give me a break, Pro Bass fishermen? I'm sure they are good at catching bass (the easiest fish to catch IMO)... I bet they would be lost if I took them out to a couple of my secret brookie spots. They probably couldn't even handle the blackflies!"
587317,Terry,2011-05-27 19:43:00,14456,bump
587327,timmeh,2011-05-27 20:20:00,609,Where's the guy from River Monsters? Maybe he's just the craziest angler.
587328,muskymike,2011-05-27 20:20:00,772,Thanks for the bump Terry. This post is amazing on so many levels.  I am going to compile my own list of the 20 best. Who wants to be on it? I have as much credibility putting this list together as the person who wrote this article. How can someone say these are the best anglers on the planet?  Amusing to say the least. Thanks for this link. I needed a good laugh today!!!
587363,bigugli,2011-05-27 22:35:00,6138,"Can't be a legit list.  No Red Fisher!!! Secondly, the Lindners will be excluded because of their religious enthusiasm. That and a few less than amicable parting of the ways."
