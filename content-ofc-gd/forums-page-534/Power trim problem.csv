497074,Nipfisher,2010-08-22 16:42:00,2449,I have a 1993 Yamaha 90hp outboard on the back of my 1990 Starcraft 170C Walleye Edition. It has been parked in my driveway for the last month. On Friday I tried to trim up my motor to raise the front end of the boat up to drain it and it didn't work. The trim motor was working but it wouldn't raise the motor. I can manually lift it so it is not locked down but it seems like there has been a loss of the hydrolic pressure. Can it be a seal? I cannot see any oil that has leaked. Is there a way to prime the pump? Any assistance would be appreciated.  Thanks.

497100,Garry2Rs,2010-08-22 18:29:00,1425,"There is a threaded plug on the reservoir.  Put the motor all the way up and fill it up using a hypodermic.  You can get one from a hospital, doctor's office, friendly nurse or at the drug store. Garry2R's"
497101,Billy Bob,2010-08-22 18:30:00,5865,Check for fluid....it might have leaked out prior to parking it in your driveway. Also check for a manual relief valve screw...this is used in many systems to relieve the hydraulic pressure in case of a malfunction of the system and you need to manually raise and lower the outboard. It could be this screw came loose thus not allowing the pressure to build up for raising and lower the outboard. I have this on my Johnson but your Yammy could be different. Hope you find a easy and inexpensive cure.  Bob

Top it up and raise and lower the motor manually a few times, refill again if necessary. Don't do it with the power unit as it will create bubbles if it is low, you don't want them. OH! to fill put the motor at the top position and the manual stop in place. Have had to top up a few times over the years."

497443,linweir,2010-08-23 19:07:00,202,I had similar problems on my 115 HP Merc a couple of years. Whole trim motor/pump was replaced.
497646,ohhenrygsr,2010-08-24 02:17:00,947,Could be an Easy fix.  Take the boat out of the water undo the fill hole you if you hear a sound like a vacuum it could be just air locked.  let all the air out and tighten the screw should solve your problem
497704,eyefish,2010-08-24 09:04:00,135,sounds like an o-ring went. Same thing happened to my 150 yammy this year. I got lucky and they crained the hydrolic pumps and cleaned them out. $1000 bucks later and it is working fine now. new trim motor and pumps $3500
587618,rufus,2011-05-29 01:14:00,267,My power trim wasn't working when I was preparing to launch my boat for the first time this season on the long weekend. The hydraulic cylinder had a long scratch on it which tuned out to be long tear - and fluid had leaked out. Has anyone else ever had a ruptured cylinder? I am wondering what caused it....
