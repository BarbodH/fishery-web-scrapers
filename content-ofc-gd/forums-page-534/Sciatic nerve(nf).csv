586997,irishfield,2011-05-26 22:05:00,26272,Great to hear Erik !!!!!!  I've been in this boat for a couple decades now.. originally told surgery was a 50/50 chance and I told them to go to hell I was walking. Currently walking like a Gorilla and maybe I'll talk to Jen's ortho surgeon next week and see if he can get me some new spinal pictures.
587005,Moosebunk,2011-05-26 22:22:00,3970,"Naprosyn, Flexeril and T3's are the more commonly Rx'd meds for LBP and Sciatica.  All drowsy drugs but often necessary in the first few days of rest.  Most common long-term treatments are stretching followed by exercise.  Your MS certainly complicates regular recovery.  Wishing you well.  I'm a back pain sufferer too, and when 1 in 4 men are said to have chronic back issues, it is something we see in the ER's very often.  Something else we see in every patient, is aging.  And yes, from the second you're conceived you are in a sense breaking down and falling apart.  Good luck Erik."
587025,ehg,2011-05-26 23:06:00,2666,"Ya Wayne, maybe you should get new spinal MRI's and get a referral to an Ortho to look at them, if needed. When my surgeon showed me the compressed disc, from t6he MRI, on the computer it looked like peanut butter and jelly squished out of a sandwich. It was a no-brainer to me to surgically fix it. I was put on T-3's initially, then percosets but neither worked. Then the last few months of oxycontin/percs combined which kinda worked but was problematic as it becomes a source of relief. Have seen many people being served this combination for fibromyalgia, hip surgeries, and other sources of nerve pain. Hoping that good diet and exercise etc...will provide good living now, not some pharmaceutical concoction."
587188,Headhunter,2011-05-27 13:06:00,5703,"Don't forget folks, that one of main causes of this affliction is not staying hydrated.

525967,OhioFisherman,2010-12-06 21:18:00,6623,"Eric, I herniated the L-5 disc in my back at work in 1994. The doctor the company sent me to had one thought in mind, save the company money. He took x-rays and told me I strained the muscles. I thought differently and took the x-rays to an orthopedic for the Cleveland Indians, all he had to do was look at them and showed me the narrowing in the gap in the discs and said I had a herniated disc.  He also questioned the motives of the other doctor because he told me any doctor should have seen it. The pain was simply put intense? I felt like I had been stabbed just above the butt and it ran down to just above my left ankle. He gave me a choice, physical therapy or surgery, he was straight up honest about it. He told me physical therapy could take some time to have an effect, and may not help. Surgery could help much faster, but may lead to more surgery.  I opted for the physical therapy, it did take 7 months for the pain to go away, and I missed 7 months of work, really no issues with it since. Like you my friend MS which can pose it`s own issues to physical therapy.  What helped me I feel the most? swimming, you can work out by swimming and without compressing the disc with your body weight. Any place near by with a heated pool? Rec center, ymca?"

Need an hour or so in morning to stretch into standing position. The MS is primary disability but the sciatica has doubled disability.  Will keep all replies in mind as i journey through this."
526160,addymark,2010-12-07 14:45:00,69,"ehg I hope your complaint resolves asap. I'm sure it is hard to deal with this as you are managing your MS as well.   I think only a few people recognize that sciatica is a waste basket term for radicular leg pain symptoms. It's upsetting that practitioners in any field are using this as a diagnosis.  If I were a patient and my Doc/physio/chiro/osteopath told me I had sciatica I would be a little concerned, and would not let them treat me until they found the root of the problem.  Many posts on this topic read I went here and it didn't help, or I did this and it made my sciatica much worse.  If you don't know what is causing the problem, know that there is a potential to exacerbate your complaint with most conservative or manual treatments.  I understand with acute pain like this you will ""try anything"" to fix it.  Just ask questions first before you let your practitioner go to town on you."
580298,ehg,2011-05-06 23:02:00,2666,"Just thought i would update this thread...  Went and saw the orthopedic surgeon today to review my MRI's from a month ago and he says i have 'massive' compression on one of my discs L1 or L5 (i forget)  . Recommended surgery as soon as possible. I said OK after he mentioned i would instantly be pain free   . So surgery is set for May 25th and apparently i would be home next day or even that night. Seems like good news, oddly looking forward to this surgery. The replies to this thread helped very much especially the ones explaining how surgery instantly helped bring relief. This way when surgery was mentioned it created no stress. The months of February and March were really brutal as the pain from this and having a Multiple Sclerosis relapse at same time left me bed ridden. Actually i wish i was bed ridden i was stuck in a kneeling position as i couldn't walk, sit or lie down due to pain Thank goodness family and friends helped me out during this time with groceries, home tending, daycare for my daughter etc... Things are better a bit now i can sit, lie down, drive car etc... looking forward to fishing this weekend for first time in seven months Thanks for past replies, it set me at ease."

580355,spincast,2011-05-07 00:51:00,3279,"Great news - may you come out of this visit pain free and on the road to recovery. I have had sciatica for years (almost 30 now) - I was a mover for 20 years and blew my back in year 10. At the low point I couldn't even drive home 1 day and had to lie on the floor for 36 hours before I coudl move ( and yes - that was uncomforatble in sooooooo many ways) I have found out the following in the interim: The Back Institute knows what they are talking about, no matter how silly you feel pretending to be a porpoise. If your legs are as little as 1/2 an inch different in length, you will experience back pain and it will gfow as you age.( JFK experienced this and special shoes corrected it) Buiild your stomach muscles - they support your back in reverse - the more situps you can do the less back pain you will feel ( I do 60 a day with a 35lb weight on my chest) If your wallet is like George Costanaza's get ready for pain. My rowing coach was right - dont use your back use your legs ---Of course, I learned that last one too late  "
580389,manitoubass2,2011-05-07 03:18:00,11391,"When you suffer from sciatica, of course this might vary from case to cause, but here is some info.  Stay active, do not take the position of thinking a back related pain/injury requires massive amounts of time in bed/on couch. Get referals from friends and family on a good local chiropractor, and go see him. He will give you stretches and excercises to do, do them daily, after showering to loosen up tense muscles. Use ice when inflammation is present, for 15-20 minutes, every 6 hours or so to reduce swelling. When there isn't swelling, use heat in the same method to help loosen tense muscles and draw oxygen rich blood to the injured area. Don't be silly and do things that cause your back to hurt, within reason. Staty away from Tylenol(acetaminophen) related products as much as possible, instead opt for ibuprofen based products, assuming you dont take blood thinners or related drugs for heart related issues, or have ulcers. Take fish oil daily, 4-6 grams, in divided doses with food.  sciatica takes time to correct, years in some cases, so get on it now before it gets worse...  Hope this helps"

The operation is Microdiscectomy as Headhunter describes above. Many of the symptoms of this disc compression are similar to the MS relapse i was going through at the time. Better days undoubtedly are ahead so i can fish and drive etc... Wayne, i will try for a panfish tomorrow for Team 3   haha  Thanks again for replies!"
580529,Jewelbee,2011-05-07 23:07:00,422,"YES! When I was in my 20s a horse flipped over on me and popped my hip joint. When it went back it pinched the nerve. I saw a chiropractor for about a year, progressively reducing visits from twice a week to twice a month, then stopped. I used ibuprofen as an anti inflammatory and to this day sleep with a body pillow to keep my hips aligned while lying down. I believe that it is a life long condition, that will always come and go, but staying fit REALLY helps. Ask your DR for exercises that will strengthen the muscle tone in your lower back and hips. I found that that was the BEST medicine so far. Because you have an existing condition, it might be different for you, but I will tell you...it WILL get better Try to be patient, I know how difficult it is to be in constant pain with this. Hope you feel better soon, Jewelbee"

Searing hot knives up and down the back of my leg from heel to lower back.  Absolutely unbearable.  I found out later I was bending my foot pegs, so coming down from 20ft not landing flat on your feet had some nasty effects.

An orthopedic surgeon did microdiscetomy on my herniated L5, S1 disk yesterday to fix the problem, now that pain is gone. I took the advice of Lew and Headhunter and did the surgery which instantly cured that pain.  A few weeks ago i tried fishing but the brutal pain made the act of simply casting or sitting and trolling an incredible ordeal. Looking forward to a decent summer/fall of productive fishing when i can get out now.  Personally, having a spinal MRI, which identified the herniated disc as the source of pain, was essential for this situation to be properly addressed. Now this horrible pain is gone.

The pain was so bad i went to a physiotherapist looking for relief wasn't getting any from painkillers etc... The physiotherapist listened to my descriptions and told me i have sciatica. I was oddly relieved as she said it could be treated. That was a week ago, i had one treatmemnt with little relief. This pain is worse than the MS stuff. Just wondering if anyone has had sciatica with successsful treatment? Apparently it is kinda common. Thanks in advance."
525803,bigugli,2010-12-06 13:33:00,6138,"Sciatica is a fairly common symptom of lower back pain. Personally, I've gotten more relief by combining physio and chiro treatments. No it does not subside quickly. Used to take 3-6 weeks to  feel semi- normal. Extreme compression on the nerves can require hospitalization Also depends on the root cause behind the sciatica. Is it a compressed disc, DDD,fragmentation, a fracture, a form of stenosis?  You may need to see an orthopedic surgeon or neurologist. As long as that root cause persists, the sciatica, and other symptoms, keeps coming back, and get progressively worse. Treatment has come a long way since Ham Hall's text ""The Back Doctor"", but his book is still a good manual for back care for yourself."

Did the whole chiro - physio thing... finally got an MRI ( 48 hrs after my doctor requested it too  )  Was referred to a nerve specialist (also a spine injury trauma specialist).  The first thing he asked me was how long it had been since I had slept and did I want IMMEDIATE RELIEF  ?  uMMM YES PLEASE.  He gave me 4 shots of Marcaine. This is the stuff they numb your gums with before they stick the cattle prod in that they pretend is a NEEDLE   .  i WAS PAIN FREE in a very few minutes!  Then the doc suggested that the pain was coming from an inflamed nerve. Ie: the nerve was pinched and we had to get the swelling down to get IT away from the herniated disc.  Hmmm... that made sense. ( all the other docs were trying to treat the cause, instead of the symptom) THIS MADE TOTAL SENSE TO ME.  He put me on Prednazone and within 48 hours I was pain free! nOW THAT pREDNAZONE HAD A FEW SIDE EFFECTS,...  but hey,,, ""potato face and a very touchy personality""   for a few days were small prices to pay( for me  ) to be pain free.  I did two weeks of physio to basically loosen up all the muscles that i was using to counter effect the pain and that was two winters ago and so far, no re-occurrences.  All the doctors have said that surgery for me is very risky due to the tumour under my disc and we will deal with this symptom as long as this form of therapy works. They also told me no more golf   . if I wanted to keep my neck in check longer. Oh well, more time for fishing and I now have a sport that I can participate in all year long."

The pain starts in the hip and lower back causing 2-hand grabbing pain down the back of the left leg thigh and calve and swelling of the feet til your shoes dont fit, extreme fatigue and weakness and litterrally hours after waking before even attempting to get out to the truck to drive anywhere.  Eric, I can only imagine what you go through with this annoying item wether it to be Sciatica or another but to be coupled with MS is so completely unfair.... I hope you find relief shortly pal... -Peter"

525928,bigugli,2010-12-06 18:26:00,6138,"Because the problem is complicated by MS affecting the muscles in your back, you really do need to see the doctor. If possible, see if you can get a referral for a specialist in Rehab Medicine. Long before viable surgical treatments were available for my conditions, I relied on an extensive rehab program and hospitalization, just to stabilize the back. That kept me going for 15 years until they could develop a surgical technique. I've had 2 surgeries, since, to repair and delay continued spinal cord deterioration. Honest truth is that with the more serious spinal problems, there are no cures, just repairs and controls. There are limitations"
525930,Scott S,2010-12-06 18:31:00,203,I had 2 large herniated disc's in my back. Struggled for years went back and forth between chiro and physio. Was finaly going to get the surgery when someone sugessted LASER treatment. I went to LASER ON therapy 3 years ago and haven't been back to a chiro or physio since.I went for about 12 treatments. My back gets sore from time to time but a little rest and good as new the next day. Scooter
525936,jimmer,2010-12-06 19:30:00,2730,"Every back situation is different, so it is a pain in itself just to go through the strategy to diagnose the issue. I have suffered for about 25 years with one surgery on my lower back thrown in there back in the 90's. I always went to the doctor and they would send me for x-rays and then tell me I had degenerative disks, blah, blah, blah.  I was sent to physio and they put me on the rack.  That was one of the worst days of my backs life. I later told the physio guy to never do that again. He looked at me funny then ask me to do a couple of strength tests. After those test, he told me he wouldn't work on me anymore and that I should go back to the doctor and ask to have a CAT scan or MRI then a referral to a surgeon.  I did that and they found that my sciatic nerve was completed flattened by a ruptured disk that was propbably there for over ten years. There were times I wanted to cut my leg off! The surgery fixed my nerve problem, but not the back problem.  I still suffer from facet joint syndrome, take Arthritis Tylenol and go to the Chiro guy every three weeks. Starting to question the chiro, but continue to go.  It feels good at the time. Heat is horrible for my back, but ice does wonders. I sometimes find myself laying on the frozen lake to get relief when out ice fishing. Get the proper pictures taken of your back before you get too involved in other stuff."
525944,Headhunter,2010-12-06 19:55:00,5703,"I had back surgury for a herniated disk in the mid 90's. Microdiscectomy... small incision, in with a laser, clean up loose parts and re-seal the bad disc...DAY SURGURY  been great ever since... Funny how no one until Jimmer's post mentioned ice... Most folks with bad backs have stressed out muscles, not structural problems (note I did say most) Muscles get over stressed and the body sends blood to heal, but when you send blood to muscles, they get inflamed and they squeeze nerves + PAIN... ice will take the blood away, so you should be doing the frozen pea thing 3-4 times a day, for 1/2 hour or so... My doctor was Dr. Michael Ford and if you can get in to see him, I highly recommend him... he know's his stuff http://orthopaedics.utoronto.ca/faculty/list/ford.htm Ranked top in his field in Canada.
