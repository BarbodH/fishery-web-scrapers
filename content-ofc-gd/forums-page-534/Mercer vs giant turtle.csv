It was the smallest turtle I have ever seen .... Nice little painted turtle... cute little guy. Took a few photos and put him back in a safe place..... good luck little buddy !

587128,mike rousseau,2011-05-27 03:36:00,4661,That happened a couple years ago to me and my dad... We were working in his backyard wich is on a creek ... When all of a sudden I see a turtle about the size of a silver dollar... Then we got to searching and ended up finding 27 of these little snapping turtles... Some of them hadn't even opened there eyes yet... They were coming up out of his garden... Moma turtle must have laid her eggs there
