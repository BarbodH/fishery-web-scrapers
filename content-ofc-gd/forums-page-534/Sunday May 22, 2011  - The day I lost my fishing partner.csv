586415,fishnsled,2011-05-25 03:35:00,3520,"Thanks again everyone, some very kind words from some truly great people. Just thought I put up a couple more shots that I've come across.  I don't think dad could be more comfortable. lol! Ice bungalow on Nippissing.    The tough old bird hauling his gear out for some late season perchin'    Still trying to figure out who is more ugly in this shot.  Yes Dad, I can see you flipping the bird at me.    Father's day 2010. OOS Bucket but so glad I took the time to grab a quick shot.     One of the few times we actually got out on his birthday.    And finally this shot just says it all. A man and his love of Canada's great outdoors.    Just noticed that the rod in the foreground has a bit of a bend! Fish on!! lol!  Thanks for taking a look at a few of my great memories."
586419,fishnsled,2011-05-25 03:42:00,3520," AWESOME idea Dan. Thanks for the suggestion. Since I bought him so much of his gear over the years it's the least he can do for me. Seriously though a very good idea, I think I'll look for the most beat up one."

Remember the good days, there's lots of laughs in there to keep you going.... and don't ever second guess the decisions that have been made the last few days.  Good luck with Grampa today, you won't have to stay a lot he'll see it in your eyes.  Wayne"

586030,fishnsled,2011-05-24 02:01:00,3520,"Thanks for all the condolences everyone. It's been one hell of a roller coaster ride this week and I'm looking to get off. Today I told my grandfather that his son was gone with my aunt and uncle. As difficult as that was he seemed to take it somewhat well, I'll be keeping a close eye on him as will the staff at his assisted living place.    I got that signature a few years ago from Gary V. Little did I know how much that would apply to me in the days gone by. I thank Gary for putting that up.     Thanks Norm. My dad spoke of that day and meeting you quite often. Thanks for putting up the pic. Probably should have got you both out fishing. He really enjoyed his time on the water and all the OFNer's he got to meet over the years."
586053,Bly,2011-05-24 02:31:00,1556,"Will, I am so sorry.  My condolences and if there is anything, let me know. Only met him the once but enjoyed his company and humour and will remember him fondly always."

586125,Headhunter,2011-05-24 13:52:00,5703,"Hey Will, Let me express my deepest sympathy to you and your family. He was a unique individual and I consider myself to be fortunate to have fished with the two of you over the last few years. You could tell how much he loved to fish, to be out in the elements and to reap the rewards of his efforts. I'll never forget the smile on his face, when ever we stopped by and dropped some fish off for him. You could tell that he would have loved to have been out with us. Know that he will never leave you and that every time you pull a Whitie through the ice, he'll be standing right beside you smiling away... You have a solid group of friends who are here to support you... please make use of us! None of us want to see you go through this and most of us have had to deal with this, so use us... I hope the next few days go well for you and you know that I'm here for you should you just want to talk or what ever... One day at a time my friend.... and I can hear him busting some chops up in heaven... he'll get things straightened out up there! HH"

As you know, I went through a similiar thing very recently, so I know what you and your family are going through.  I had the pleasure of fishing with you and your dad a few times, and I will always remember how welcoming and friendly he was.  His smile was infectious and he could sure catch fish!  But most of all, I could see the relationship the two of you had...and that is something that will carry you through these hard times.  The memories are there forever now...and as hard as it is to remember them as happy times now, the day will come where that's all you will remember and feel.  As Joe said, you have lots of friends here...please don't hesitate to give me a call at anytime ok?  I will be in touch soon.  Here is a photo I took from a few years ago...  "

585739,fishnsled,2011-05-23 05:29:00,3520,"What a week from hell. Do to some recent health problems and the complications do to the pneumonia that settled in this past week, I am deeply saddened with the loss of my Dad. He is the man responsible for getting me into this great pastime called fishing. Over the years we had countless hours on the water whether that be walking a river, fishing in a boat or standing on the hard water. I will miss my Dad, my fishing partner very much. Just thought I'd share a few pics for now and will try to find a few more in the morning.  Dad and his sons.   Same day with a nice brown I caught.   Haliburton Walleye.   Simcoe Whitefish   Jumbo Perch.    A nice Father's Day Kawartha eye.   And one of my favourites, the first fish boated in the new ride back in 2002. Also know as the $25,000 perch.    The passion we both had for fishing was incredible. The memories will never go away, the stories of our times together will be told for many years to come, the sorrow and sadness of the loss of my fishing partner, my Dad will have a great heaviness on my heart for a very long time. It is very difficult to know that he will not be sitting beside me on the water again. I'm not sure how that first trip will go or even when I will ready to make that voyage. When that time comes, I know that he will be there in spirit on that trip and all others to come. Love you Dad."

Where there is hatred, let me sow love; where there is injury,pardon; where there is doubt, faith; where there is despair, hope; where there is darkness, light; and where there is sadness, joy.   O Divine Master, grant that I may not so much seek to be consoled as to console; to be understood as to understand; to be loved as to love. For it is in giving that we receive; it is in pardoning that we are pardoned; and it is in dying that we are born to eternal life. Amen"
