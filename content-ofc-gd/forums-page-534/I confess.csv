Nothing spectacular, just staying close to home and hitting a few spots. Lots of yellow and white perch for feasting on, but nobody wants to see 100 panfish pics  Peanut sure had a lot of fun chasing, and eating, the catch. Here's a wee sampling of the past few day's activity.         Even managed to catch some rays in the process."
