587233,Leecher,2011-05-27 15:37:00,7832,"Like Kerry said, it looks similar to a suspended rogue.... but could be wrong"
587288,singingdog,2011-05-27 18:01:00,1047,Rogues don't have that kind of detail at the nose: they have that old-school pointy nose similar to rapalas.
587351,ehg,2011-05-27 21:35:00,2666,Had nothing to do earlier so checked as many minnowbait/jerkbait images and found nothing that had that exact colouring and scrunched up nose. Must be some cheapy knock-off from Dollarama like some others said. It has the scrunched nose making it so different.
587377,mbac31,2011-05-27 22:53:00,904,This is a HMKL knockoff designed by the same guys who have designed the H2O baits and others. They also make a popper that same color pattern. This is why it resembles a Strike Pro.  They are found in bulk at certain stores as well as your local Dollar stores and they are also found at canadian tire stores next to the Matzuo ones. These are all made in the same factory in China. I have a catalogue from them and that exact bait is there. This is the same place that Lunkerhunt from Ontario is made along with others.
587384,EC1,2011-05-27 23:05:00,930,"AWESOME! Thanks a bunch to everyone! Marvin, it's crazy you know exactly what knockoff this is! Maybe if I find some at the dollar store, I should probably stock up on them. It's crazy to think that this jerkbait costed a dollar, because this guy suspended perfectly nose down, and the paint also has a nice yellow sheen in the sun!  Now this really brings me to the point....Do I really need to buy a 25 dollar Japanese jerkbait!? This guy outfished my 25 dollar jerkbait for the day, and all this costed was 4 split rings and 3 trebles + $1.13 at the dollar store!"
587406,mbac31,2011-05-28 01:03:00,904,"There was a bunch of these made from different guys. Megabait being one of them. The difference is the quality. It will be fine for now but they tend to rust a lot quicken and fail. The fixed weight system is usually the way to go in this style. I have a picture of ones sawed in half somewhere. Far more inferior then others. Balance is very inconsistant in these products, you get a good and you dont. Steel in the rings that are fixed to attach the split rings on are very cheap and usually break down. You got a good one so keep it. I have tons of these things. Lol. The paint does not differ that much only in weight I find. Its like a ugly woman, makeup can do wonders."
587419,Nipfisher,2011-05-28 01:36:00,2449,The cheap ones from the Dollar Store are sold under the name MAKO. I picked up a few for my son's tackle box and Rod Caster can attest that I tried 2 of them too. for pike. One had a great wobble action (fixed weight) and the other was a floating rattling one theat actually rolled over on itself on fast retrieve. I only had it on for 2 casts and that was long enough to see that it sucked. Now...I did find some Panther Martin Vivif swim baits at the dollar store. They look great and retail for around $4 a pack. I think these sold for $1.50 for a package of 2.
587027,EC1,2011-05-26 23:15:00,930,"Good Evening all, Got quite a big question for lure junkies out there. I didn't particularly know this jerkbait until about yesterday, when its action and fish-slamming capabilities were exposed! The only problem is, I have no clue what make or model this is, and I was wondering if you guys could recognize it? My dad actually snagged it when we were shore fishing a couple of years ago.  You won't be able to ID this via the hooks, because those were put on by myself, and if it helps, it says ""SP"" or Suspend at the bottom of it between the 2nd and 3rd treble. It has quite loud rattles, no weight transfer system, Half Oz., and is about the same size as a Vision 110. (110mm)    This is a larger image of it in case you need more details. Larger Pic Thanks in Advance!"
587033,bow slayer,2011-05-26 23:25:00,1074,looks like a matzuo glass zander shad   suspending model 9.2 cm.
587034,GBW,2011-05-26 23:30:00,8460,it looks like a Lucky Craft flash minnow SP 110 to me but I bet I'm wrong.
587037,mattp33,2011-05-26 23:34:00,290,"  Looks like an old cotton cordell Iused to have.  They have tripple trebles like that.  My bet is you get a hundred different answers!  Bowslayer could be right tho!  The color is off for it to be a cordell, Matzuo has colors like that!"
587046,BFSC Kevin,2011-05-26 23:59:00,1351,you guys telling me that its a not a husky jerk?!?!?!
587048,Rizzo,2011-05-27 00:07:00,4754,"looks like the one I lost a couple of years ago, apparently some guy snagged it from shore and kept it. You can mail it back to me now"
587050,esoxansteel,2011-05-27 00:12:00,1307,"Had me worried I thought my picture was going to appear, what a relief"
587051,manitoubass2,2011-05-27 00:18:00,11391,"the head of the bait looks almost like XPS design, but I'm pretty sure it's not.  Also looks similar to some Xcaliber stick baits, but it isn't  I'm not sure what the hell it is??? I have a crank with the exact pattern though, came with a crappy two piece from wal mart my son got a few years ago"
587054,Gerritt,2011-05-27 00:22:00,6129,my guess is a cheap Chinese knock-off.
587055,irishfield,2011-05-27 00:23:00,26272,YO-Zuri
587058,adempsey,2011-05-27 00:29:00,1498, That'd be my guess too.
587070,singingdog,2011-05-27 01:12:00,1047," Yep. It's definitly not Flashminnow or a Husky Jerk. It sure looks like the Matzuo, but they get knocked off (or sold under other names) a lot."
587075,zeeter,2011-05-27 01:32:00,92,Check the Walmart marked down section.
587110,vance,2011-05-27 02:55:00,719,Thought for SURE it would be a pic of one of my fishing buddies    vance
587119,johnnyb,2011-05-27 03:18:00,3413,"My first thought, based on the eyes, was StrikePro.  Perhaps that is what the SP stands for?"
587125,dhickey,2011-05-27 03:29:00,1038,Wallmart/Zellars/Giant tiger/Dollarama  ???  
587141,2jack2,2011-05-27 04:18:00,92,"I agree with johnnyB, this Stike Pro lure,"
587144,adempsey,2011-05-27 04:42:00,1498,"  I think you're right.  It looks very much like the Strike Pro Alpha Minnow, although I couldn't find anything on the net with that color and red eyes.   Don't even think I have ever come across a Strike Pro minnow bait before."
587159,singingdog,2011-05-27 11:01:00,1047," I was too quick on the trigger last night. I think you're right: it looks like an alpha minnow in Strike Pro's baby bass pattern. The Matzuo only has 2 hooks, this one has 3."
587173,fishindevil,2011-05-27 12:03:00,6254,a strike pro for sure!!! but there is several other companies that have the patent for them now and make them under a few different names!!!  challenger i think makes them as well...cheers
587183,EC1,2011-05-27 12:57:00,930,Thanks for the help! Glad you guys like the title! When I checked the strike pro alpha minnow it says it floats an dives about 3feet. Mine suspends and dives about 5 feet. I guess it's some knock off then. Better not be losing it anytime soon!
587209,Kerry,2011-05-27 14:41:00,383,The sp leads me to believe it's a suspending Rogue Minnow. Kerry
587212,Headhunter,2011-05-27 14:52:00,5703,"To me, it looks like a it's a Renosky?! HH"
587213,Harrison,2011-05-27 14:57:00,2202,"I was thinking knock off right off the bat, but the hooks threw me off.  After reading your original post again I see you changed the hooks.  So my gut stands, knock off."
587217,Headhunter,2011-05-27 15:03:00,5703,Have a look... http://www.renoskylures.com/Merchant/merchant.mv?Screen=CTGY&Store_Code=RLI&Category_Code=MIP HH
