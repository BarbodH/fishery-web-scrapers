Yeah they were on fire...  hitting the M/G like there was no tommorow.    I mean how can you keep such a beauty.    Put them back in and they grow like weeds ...    He made the switch from swimmers to spinners.      These brutes love to ambush the lures...  he missed my lure and i just released my reel.... let the spinner sink and he nailed it on the drop.    Crazy hit and all in gin clear water 3d in my face....  Best hit in 2011 ......SO FAR!!  enjoi

587318,Fishing 24/7,2011-05-27 19:44:00,709,  negative! iv finaly mastered the long nose / leave the pike in the net / leave the net in the water / undergil hand swipe / support the belly technique!   its keeps them calm and i have almost 100% survival rate....  unless i rip there heads off with my hook set.
