He got a call from the Marina, and apparently, the plywood below the carpet and possibly the support beams have rotted out and need to be replaced. We plan on heading up early tomorrow morning to do some repairs, and if all goes well, get a little fishing time in as well.  Question:  Neither of us have experience working with boats; my plan is to basically copy the existing design and replace all the rotted wood as need be. What type of wood should we use??? Is there a specific grade or type that is best to ensure it doesnt soak up water and decompose again?  Your help is greatly appreciated OFC!  Thanks"
587235,bigbuck,2011-05-27 15:40:00,2449,Marine grade plywood. Check your local lumberyard (not Home Depot or other big box stores). Do it with the right stuff and it will last a long time. Cheap out and you'll be doing it again in a couple of years.
587240,scugpg,2011-05-27 15:56:00,1373, Could you use regular ply and stain/seal it instead? That may still be cheaper than marine ply.
587247,craigdritchie,2011-05-27 16:33:00,1586,"You can go that route, but it won't work nearly as well. Marine grade plywood has the sealant impregnated right through each layer in the wood. Stain/seal on regular plywood will only form a protective layer on the outside, so when that layer gets damaged (drop a pair of pliers on the deck, for instance, and put a tiny dent in it) the water will get in.  As always, you get what you pay for."
587280,addy79,2011-05-27 17:34:00,573,"Thanks, Craig  Last Question:  Does anyone know of a lumber yard near Peterborough or Bridgenorth that sells Marine grade plywood?  much apppreciated..."

587413,duckdog,2011-05-28 01:21:00,162,"Use exterior grade ply, same glue as marine just the ext ply has more voids if you want it sealed good coat it with epoxy, but marine ply will handle way more stress"
587416,vinnimon,2011-05-28 01:28:00,2593,An added measure I did with the marine plywood I installed in my boat. Was that I coated the plywood with fiberglass resin for extra protection. Solid as a rock.
