585994,steverowbotham,2011-05-24 00:31:00,1800,"Wow, seems like its been forever!! We had a really busy spring and we moved to a larger property just north of Barrie and I'm loving it!! I can finally put my boat in the garage which is super exciting.  Did a few early May speck trips with some decent success, but nothing spectacular. Got out to Couchiching for pike opener last weekend.  Fishing was tough but managed to get into a few.  Most were just little hammerhandles but got a couple decent fish on a Strike Zone Swammer swimbait.    Saturday, I took a friend up to Muskoka for opener.  Fishing was tough again, we got some really good fish but we had to work hard for them.  Sunny, flat calm weather mixed with an insane amount of boat traffic didnt help our cause. Jerkbaits and swimbaits did the damage for us.  Even got a 40 inch musky, which I've never caught out of this lake before.          Thanks for reading"
