522700,wallyboss,2010-11-25 18:09:00,1095,If you are looking for a regular slingshot  Walmart has them.  Specific for chumming   No idea!!
522703,ckrb2007,2010-11-25 18:11:00,449,Bass Pro usually has a bin full of them up near the check-outs.

522715,dsn,2010-11-25 18:42:00,1018,$10 bucks and you can have mine. Only used it once. Can't stand it. Made by E.S.P   Used it once and all the corn ended up in my face. Least it was sweet.  I get better results using a spod instead.  dsn

522800,crossover,2010-11-25 22:27:00,172,Best bets (as I live in Toronto and driving all the way to St. Catherines or Hamilton is insane) would be BPS or Princess Auto. Also HH please don't spam this thread. Newworldcarp have a location or is it only online (I am ok with online as long as shipping isn't crazy)
522805,GBW,2010-11-25 22:36:00,8460,ya don't have any Crap Tire's in the city?  They are $10. there.

522993,bassjnkie,2010-11-26 15:53:00,1101,DSN is right. Angling Spec carries some of the NWC products. Give them a call first.
523044,hammercarp,2010-11-26 17:53:00,964,The slingshots from CTC and Bass Pro don't have a big enough pouch. The slings made for carp fishing have a large rubber pouch that will hold much more bait. New World is worth a try.
