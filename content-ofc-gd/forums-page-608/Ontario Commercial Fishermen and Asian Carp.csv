A committee consisting of representatives from the province of Ontario and the states adjacent to the lake -- Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania and New York -- determine the limits.""  LOL fair share? no commercial fishing for walleye on the Ohio side of Lake Erie, Ontario be fair? buy them out like we did?"
