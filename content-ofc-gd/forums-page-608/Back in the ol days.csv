523213,blue pickeral,2010-11-27 09:53:00,267,"Back in the old days everyone is writing about, banks were extremely stingy when lending money for consumer goods. You could get a fixed interest mortgage for 30 years, but loans for anything else were rare.  You may remember a TV commercial for HFC - Household Finance Corporation. Their slogan was ""we believe when you want something it becomes a need!"". Not sure what happened to HFC, but the banks realized they were missing out on a money maker and began lending more freely. Thus began a long trail of instead of figuring out how to make things cheaper (while taking into account fluffy 'options' to things - such as heated mirrors on cars)they just figured out easier ways for consumers to finance things. Looks like 7 year terms for a car loan these days?  Also, in northern Ontario there was 1 TV station. The then owner of the Toronto Maple Leafs wouldn't allow the broadcast of Hockey Night in Canada to include the first period of Leafs' games to encourage people to buy tickets and see the game in person. As a 5 year old youngster, signed up for 'Squirts' organized hockey and during our first game, half the kids headed for the shack after 2 periods thinking that's how many periods were in the game!  I hate the Leafs to this day, have never spent a cent that would benefit them and (apologies in advance) have a dim view of anyone with a Leafs license plate or flag on their vehicle!"
523222,dave524,2010-11-27 13:20:00,4508," Banks   remember setting up a chequing/savings account 35 years ago, as long as I had a grand in there, there were no service fees for any number of transactions and a good interest rate to boot, next they cancelled the minimum balance no service fees but the interest usually covered the service. Today the fee is $10.95 a month and the interest is squat, but I do get a $4 rebate now as a senior citizen  Grew up watching the Leafs in Niagara in the original six days. We had the same thing going on with the missing first period too. The games would start later then, 8:00 pm and on Saturday you would get the whole game but the Wednesday home games, you would get regular programming till 9:00 pm and then they would cut to the game usually around the start of the 2nd.

523264,JohnF,2010-11-27 15:51:00,3494," That's what Bruce (my buddy) wants for his tricked out flathead with the three deuces on top. He just sold the other rod that would have been perfect but for the too cool tricked up Olds engine already resident in the open air. It was a classic Ford bucket from the 50's that some American feller offered way too much money for. Bruce had too many cars in the garage and really wanted some space. I'm surprised that he sold that one though. He'd hung on to it for at least 40 years.  Kinda like the '28 Chev sheet metal I kept around for years thinking I'd get a frame for it one day (and a drive train, and an interior, and a lot of body filler, etc etc). I always ended up spending my time helping friends build cars for themselves. I guess it was cheaper fun. The rest of the fun was that invariably they wanted to test their new rods against other guys on the street but for the most part these guys couldn't drive for beans. Driving meaning shifting. I could shift. It was easy in OPC (other people's cars) because you just kept your foot to the floor and listened or felt the revs and when it felt right you hammered a shift. I never missed but I'm not sure I'd have been as cocky about it in a hot car with all my own money invested. I drove my own cars hard but the fun ones didn't have the same power, or when they did it was usually in front of an autoshifter and it was more about top end than 1/4 miles. I'm amazed looking back that I kept my license.  Speaking of the old days. I bought and built a few well-used (two out of parts boxes) motorcycles and got interested in Enduro riding so my first new bike was a Yammy DT1b in 1968 for $850 all set up new from the dealer. Nifty bike that had all my Triumph and Harley riding friends laffing at me for this wimp toy. They stopped laffing the first day we took the bikes out to a farmer's gravel farm. He had some nice sod/dirt hills for climbing and the big iron boys often met there on Sunday afternoons to rip and snort up the hill on their street tires and street gearing. I showed up one day with my little Yammy with a new set of gears and a big nasty motocross tire on the back and walked up their easy hill. Before long they were all lining up to give my bike a try and they loved it. It kinda spoiled their big bike fun after that though. At least after that they allowed me to ride with them unless we were going to some place cool like Grand Bend. They didn't want to be seen with me on the Yammy but I had my own old 650 Triumph with the peanut tank, rail, front end extensions, megaphone pipes and dogbone bars that I could roll out for those rides. But I loved to ride that Yammy the rest of the time.  Sure miss those days but my bike riding days kinda came to a halt on orders from SWMBO shortly after I brought my 12 year old son home on the back of the new used Kawi Ninja and before I could warn him to keep his mouth shut he blabbed that we were going some speed slightly in excess of the legal but it was on a perfect road freshly paved with excellent forward visibility and absolutely no traffic in sight. The bike didn't so much as quiver, not like the old Triumphs for sure, and Matt just kept hollering in my ear to go faster. I only got to keep that bike for the summer and was under orders never to take the boys on it again. Actually the 13 year old made that easy. He refused after hearing his brother babble. I succumbed to the pressure from the wife front finally and gave up bikes for golf and other boring grown up stuff. I'm suffering the pangs lately though. I really am missing riding. Problem is I wouldn't settle for a cruiser, only a crotch rocket and I'm not sure how my aging hips would take to that riding posture any more. It was tough enough in my 40's. I ended up standing on the pegs a lot even then. I'd also be very happy to find another Yammy Enduro for an around town ride but they're kinda rare now and while we're living in the condo parking is an issue.  If you guys keep this thread running I'm gonna be back to talk about what it was like riding in the horse drawn milk wagon to save some walking on my paper route at age 11/12, working in a grocery store as a bagger/carryout and doing phone in orders and home deliveries with my boss(remember those days) Friday nites and Sats and then daily in the summer for something 50 cents per hour, two summers in a meat packing plant (seems to me the pay cheque was something like $60/wk) when summer students had to figure out how to avoid the sweet (not!) jobs on the kill floors or the stock barns (got great stories about those two summers, and I still eat meat including bologna that I mixed and chopped and hung), on the CNR spare gang lifting track and chucking escutcheon plates up and over the side of a high gondola car till the pain in your shoulders had you hanging by an elbow off the ladder and letting the train drag you along the roadbed as your free arm got torn out from the heavy little plates, on road construction trying to keep my little (we were physically about as dissimilar as two brothers could be) brother out of fights with big nasty impatient drivers who generally were pretty quick to chill when they realized they didn't just have a 125# toothpick to deal with (truth is I was never a fighter but size works too), and finally joining the ranks of employed adultery in 1965 as a teacher at a rich-making contract of $3,400/annum with benefits.  I'll stop typing now.  JF"

522997,Moosebunk,2010-11-26 16:04:00,3970,"The old days for a young feller like me...  Both parents worked.  My mother lived for her boys and her career.  An elementary school teacher whom during many (8) of my childhood years studied her nights away in her room while chipping away at her Masters in Education.  She rarely missed one of my brother's or my hockey games and after school was first home to pop the Y&R on the TV while cooking us up a healthy meal.  She exemplified what it is to be dedicated and giving.  She is still revered by many as their favorite school teacher from back in their days.  She is the heart of our family.  She never skips a beat, never rests.  My father lived for us boys, his work and himself.  A professional photographer and business owner he put 5-6 days a week into his store from 75-93, later moving on to work with the town Police Department.  A perfectionist, he always did things once and did them right.  A man who loved and practiced his favorite hobbies as often as he could.  He gave Noel and I the longest leash by which to learn yet with a choke chain that reminded us of responsibility first, and he taught many life lessons, and still does...  I started work at 14 for $4.00hr.  I wasn't allowed to miss work for anything; especially self induced weekend illnesses, although I could get away with skipping school.  Most of my friends in highschool didn't work as much or hard as I did during evenings, weekends and summers off... they didn't necessarily play as hard either, as my wallet was usually thicker from work.  My father was of the mindset that if I wanted something, I'd earn it and not get it before I could afford it... although alot of people late 80's to 90's seemed to sway to the opinion of ""why buy it with your own money... credit.""  When College came I got loans but still had to work quite a bit.  I failed first year but during that time learned that I am the son of my parents.  Very unhappy with failure and debt, the remaining years ti'll now I've made sure to live with little of either.  Goals that more kids coming up would be wise to wanting to achieve.  I don't look back at the old days as much as I compare to just 10 years ago... before I left for the north.  Up north to me feels like 10-20 years ago, so when I settled here again, with more time to view things, things seem to have jumped ahead quickly.  In 10 years it seems as though the ""ME"" generation has really taken over and like a vaccuum I find myself; and many raised right people too, getting sucked in.  But how can we not?  It's pretty much mainstream.  This person wants this, this person that.  This one gets their way, this one does not.  This one complains, and in the old days might have been told to suck it up if even being listened to at all, but nowadays... the complainer gets their way.  So we do more complaining now too.  And... how dare anyone tell us we're wrong to do so, cause we'll complain about them complaining about our complaint. lol  One child in school has a peanut allergy, all children will go without peanut butter sandwiches. God help us all with this allergic epidemic.. lol.  Hydro prices are to go up; probably in ""most"" part because everyone wants new and less effective but more expensive green energy... so we start peeing and moaning... (although probably no one will listen on that one)  My home in the north was ""all inclusive,"" but now that I pay heat and hydro separately too, not thinking I almost got sucked into ""the complainer vaccuum"" earlier this week with the hydro business until someone of the ""back in the days"" era, my father, taught me again...  $3000 a year/ $250 a month hydro... I'll guess.  $8.21 a day/ $0.35 an hour.  So, for $0.35 this hour all my family's food won't spoil, my TV's will work during this day of miserable Hydro line damaging freezing rain, I can type this out on my desktop while my lights are on, laundry is fluffin' and my coffee is brewing. So what should I really be complaining about???  (I just wanted somehow to tie this in, as the original thread was locked and I never got the chance to make a point. lol.)  I dunno where to go with the rest of this after reading people's interesting stories of old.  We all hold times in our life as great and some other times not so much.  Years gone by have their good and bad points I guess, (Bologna, liver and man-eating sabre-tooth tigers being a few of the bad) just like today has the same.  The biggest difference nowadays over yester- years though, seems to be this ever increasing complacency that fosters complaint in hopes to adapt.  It's all about me, how I can't handle ""No"" and am entitled to better because my best contributions to society are my hair, Blackberry and couch-potatoing skills.  It's a movement towards more pick-pocketing, piddling, piggy-backing, finger pointing and pining that juat reverberates until it becomes todays and everydays noise which is sadly different from yesterdays and hard for some to listen to.  Somedays I can't stand the sound of things either and wish all I had to do was ride my skateboard, mind my P's... and Q's, and go out chasing tail with a buzz on.  Ahh well, best have that $0.35 cup of java now and wake up... rereading this post, methinks I fell off the sane train after my parents."

523034,fishnsled,2010-11-26 17:23:00,3520,"Man! You guys are old...    I think you've nailed it Terry.  I remember when I was very young my Dad delivered milk (yes they used trucks for home delivery, my grandfather delivered milk and bread via horse and wagon in Timmins and Toronto) for Rutherford's Dairy which was on Kennedy Rd in Scarborough. They also had the best ice cream that I can remember.  I remember as a kid wanting to go with my grandfather (Mom's Dad) up north (Owen Sound area) to visit with family. I'd pack my tackle and clothes and be all set. We'd visit his brothers and sisters over the course of a couple of weeks touring around Bruce County. Whenever the opportunity was there I'd be gone fishing. Have breakfast in the morning, have a lunch packed, and be gone all day by myself, sometimes with my brother. No one was ever concerned, that I know of, and the only questions were if I had a good time and are we having fish for dinner. Caught plenty of bass, pike, and speckled trout over the years. Great times and GREAT memories. I miss my grandfather a lot.  First job I had was delivering the Toronto Star. Second job I had I worked in my grandfather's office(Dad's Dad and he's still with us at 90 this year) making $5.00 an hour, I think minimum was $2.85 at the time. Worked in the mail room sorting mail and delivering it around the office. Also ran the photocopy machine, Ditto machine and the Gestetner machine and paper shredder. I won't get into all the part-time and summer jobs that I had but the diversity certainly gave me lots of great experiences looking back.  With the jobs came some money. I had enough to buy the things I needed or wanted, sometimes even saved a bit. Remember when the metric system came in and my elders complaining about it. I remember gas being 30 something cents a litre and the big jump to 40 cents, doesn't seem too bad now. Penny candy, Lolas, pop in glass bottles, water from a tap, buying smokes for my parents with a note. Driving for the first time in my grandfather's 1969 Dodge Polara with a 318 in her, did my road test with that boat. 10 bucks in gas and you could drive her all week!  Looking back, maybe the costs and such are all relative to our incomes as Terry had said. What has changed perhaps is the family core for so many. Technology certainly has played a huge roll in that. I wonder how many kids that would give up the computers/ipods/gaming devices to spend a couple of weeks with family and fishing? Mind you if all the technology was around when I was a kid, I wonder if I would have. Looking back I'm glad it wasn't around. Great thread Brian."

523042,HTHM,2010-11-26 17:49:00,4082,How it was: 
523049,JohnF,2010-11-26 18:00:00,3494,"  Back in 1963 when I was still in high school I bought my first car. Actually it was a share of a car. Four of us anteed up and bought a '53 Dodge/Plymouth (I forget) with a Red Ram hemi in it. Not quite the same hemi the new Chrysler cars used but we thought it sounded cool. As I recollect we paid $25 for this thing running with plates on it. I don't think we ever transferred the registration because we figgered we'd bust it before we got a month or so out of it. Of course we had no insurance. It was missing a front seat so we fastened wooden coke cases to the floor boards somehow. The muffler was totally shot so we just punched a bunch of holes in a quart oil can and wired it to the pipe where the muffler should have been. As long as you were light on the gas the noise was manageable when the cops were nearby. We lost a lot of cans but they were easy to replace.  The car was a 4 door model and the centre pillars were rusted out at the bottom so that when we cornered it looked like it was sprouting a wing on the out side as the doors did the centrifugal force thing. We got used to it but it concerned those who weren't expecting it.  We didn't want our parents to know about it so we just kept it parked in an alleyway and someone picked it up each morning and got the rest of the guys on the way to school. We always went to a local drivein for lunch together in it. We'd put a gallon or two of gas in it as required but any more than that and the tank leaked. I recollect that the oil it burned cost about as much as the gas did. Seems to me gas was 25 or 35 cents/gallon (not liter) then but I may have that confused with a year or two later.  Imagine getting away with that today. Oh, and we were right about the expected life. I think it ran for about 6 weeks before it totally died and nothing we could do short of spending money could revive it. We towed it to the dump one day and dropped it.  A few years later I bought a very clean and good running Ford Vic for $60. I don't think I had to spend a penny on it to make it a driver. I forget why but i didn't keep it long. Shame really. I'd sure like to be able to have it today for the same price.  Then in 1965 I turned down a one owner '57 V8 Chevy 4 door that was immaculate. It had belonged to some old guy who garaged it every night and babied it. After he died his wife advertised it for sale for $750. I was tempted but I really wanted a 2 door. She offered to drop the price but I wasn't buying. Another missed opportunity.  Times sure are different today, huh? Imagine what that Vic or the Chevy would sell for today? And imagine trying to run that Dodge today.  JF"
523053,bigugli,2010-11-26 18:11:00,6138," Steinbergs was more of a Quebec chain. Lasted less than 10 years in North York at the Jane/Wilson mall. I do remember my Gram always collecting green stamps and the monthly expedition down to Honest Ed's.  It was quite the trip from North York. From Jane st, you ran down and picked up the Rogers rd, which got you to the Bloor Danforth subway. Or you took the jane bus to the Trethewey loop which took you to the Yonge line at Eglinton with a transfer onto the BDL. Back then Toronto was still divided into zones so you had to pay a double fare each way, and you could only use a transfer once. Once in a while we could cheat by catching the bus the stepfather was driving. Let me tell you, going from rural Muskoka to TO was absolutely mind boggling and scary. Especially the suburbs; an endless sea of houses and buildings with not a real tree in sight."

I thought I had the world by the balls.Then came one son,ok were both working this is cool.The second son,time to budget.One car,different shifts.Thats a trick and a half.Finally went into debt and bought a second truck. Nightmares from there on. Lessons learned."
522795,crappieperchhunter,2010-11-25 22:16:00,2582,"Powdered Milk. Haven't thought about that crap for years. We used to mix it with Nestle's Quik to make it tolerable. Funny we went through so much Nestle's Quik that my folks probably never saved a dime by cheaping out and not buying real milk. Got the quik at the grocery store but my folks probably should have ordered it direct from the factory...by the yard  One car family and my Dad worked shifts. So if I had a hockey game or practice..it was walk to the arena. Approx 4 miles each way...slugging hockey gear in the cold. My son NEVER had to walk to the arena...EVER.  Most families where in the same boat.  And it wasn't just hockey...we walked or rode our bikes EVERYWHERE. Most from my generation probably walked more before they where 12 years old then most people these days ever will there entire lives. I'm not complaining...I didn't mind it at all...that's just the way it was.  Once you where 16 and old enough to drive, weekend's where grab a box of beer and jump in the car and drink & drive. Not real proud of that now...and I'm glad that has changed...but again that's just the way it was.  We lived a mile out of town and every boy had a PELLET GUN...and I don't know anyone who ever got hurt. God help you if you where a black squirrel or a starling though  Used to be able to pedal our bikes into the hardware store and buy our own pellets too, all you had to do was have the money.  I also remember hardly ever wearing a shirt in the summer. As soon as it warmed up for the day, if you where outside playing or working and a guy, you where shirtless. No way you could do that now. 30 minutes in my veggie garden and I have to retire to the shade or put a long sleeve shirt on or I will be as red as a beet.  In 1981 I started working for the company I am still with today. Starting wage was $6.85/hour ...within 3 years I was up to $12.44, which was pretty decent then. However the last 25 years my wages have not increased that fast. Like most production environment jobs, I think wages have not kept pace with inflation. Overall today your money doesn't go as far.  Great thread...let's hear some more."

Also to make some extra cash I officiated hockey games. 15yrs old  at the time. Walk there in the cold and walk home,10 pm,dang there was some cold nights.Made 10-15 bucks a game.4 hours in a cold rink then walk home,,,,,,,,BBUUURRRRRRRRRRRR.  How many parents do you see carry a kids hockey bag out from a rink? WAY TO MANY."
522817,mercman,2010-11-25 23:21:00,7054,"I also remember the whole familly sitting aroung the Old philco tV my dad paid 15 bucks for,watchin the Ed Sullivan show, or Red Skeltons Christmas special.Mom would bake for months before Christmas and my Bro and i would hide in the basement and eat the frozen cookies. Gram and Gramps would drive from Ottawa to NB in his 56 Ford and bring us kids all kinds a stuff.They would stay for a month and we would go toboganing on an old sled made from shipping crates Dad brought home from the Base Exchange. Gump Worsley,Eddy Shack,Rocket Richard, CBC Hoskey Nite in Canada.The Avengers, The Man from U.N.C.L.E. , Lassie, Walt Disney. TV shows were well done and always entertaining. Anyone remember Wayne and Schuster or the Smothers Brothers or Don Messers Jubilee !!! I watched them all with Pops sipping hot chocolate made the the afore mentioned powdered milk. What a life eh"
522825,spincast,2010-11-25 23:48:00,3279,"At 7 I could walk 2 miles home by myself from school, play inthe creek, catch crayfish and see minnows galore, and get home 45 minutes after I was expected and my parents wouldn't be freakin'or worried about what happened to me. I knew almost everybody in each house on the walk home, and would wave to the 4 or 5 familes whose back yards I used to take short cuts through to and from walking everywhere - even when I was 16  I could stop at any stream or pond, drop in a worm on a hook and catch a fish  My mom flipped out the first time she spent 100 bucks on groceries - even though it was for a neighbourood bash with about 10 famlies and work people attending, and took 2 shopping carts and a couple bag boys to bring them out to the car --- Which was a Chevy Nova station Wagon -- Seat belts????? Ha!.  Me and my brother used to play in the back of it on long trips to the holiday get away - with the back window rolled down and our feet stickin out. I could ride my Honda CT 70 all day for $0.10 Phones only came in black with a dial, unless you were rich everyone I knew had black and white TV, if they had one and adjusting the bunny ears and getting up to change the channel were facts of life (we watched way more commercials then,,,,,) AM radio was it, and if you styed up late on hot summer noghts you coudl actually hear radio from a town other than the one you lived in.. 45's were music and 33's were what you could afford when you were older and had a good job Stereo was introduced but is nothing like what we know as stereo today Long distance calls were only made on the weekends during certain time periods and kept very short.

522837,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-11-26 00:13:00,0," I think that sounds about right. TJ is saying it was 40 cents a liter where he was at. But I remember 40 cents a liter not too long ago. Probably 40 cents a GALLON! Talk about robbery!   Dang! I forgot about that! All the bottles I used to scrounge to buy my cigarettes!! I started smoking at a very young age....   Even though we are not living under the aftermath of a war? Times before the wars were much better then today. Wars brought debt, taxes and inflation.....  Necessities of life were much cheaper back in the day........Non essentials were more expensive since not everyone bought them(or needed them).  Back in the day one income could support a family. Today two incomes and people are still trying to make ends meet. People spent more time with their families. Less hours, less overtime, more vacation time. Now some people cant even afford to take vacation.....  Still we have things like A/C, TV, VCR, Washing machines, Dishwashers, telephones(used to be for the rich), cars(ditto), ect.....You'd think with all this we would have more time to spend with our families, but we have less time, because we have to work more to pay for it all.....  Anyways, I remember we used to make our own toys out of wood. Bows and arrows, sling shots, wooden planes, guns, pinball machines, goal carts,ect...  I remember walking an hour to get to the local swimming pool.I remember walking half an hour to get to school everyday.My parents used to walk a quite a few miles just to go to the store........ Now walking is a foreign concept to me(and most kids)...  Everything is rush, rush, rush, and everyone is trying to outdo the next guy.......And this competition drives prices up.  If you want to live the simple life, go to Europe and see how they live off of the land, you will see who lives the better life. Go to an Italian wedding where the family slaughters a couple of lambs, pigs, the pasta(made from Scratch),vegetables, fruits,ect... I'm talking a table full to the rim of food. Lots and lots of bottles of home made wine,  and then break out the harmoncia and the accordian and dance till dawn.....You know how much a wedding costs in Canada? All competition.  I think the newfies on this board can relate!"
522842,Terry,2010-11-26 00:22:00,14456,yet  I remember my Grandparents saying all these things  and I remember my parents saying these things and now I am saying the same things were cheaper simpler safer sweeter better and what a world the young ones are growing up in and growing up so fast now.....  every generation says it in my opinion

522848,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-11-26 00:39:00,0, That's because taxes and cost of living always go up. They never go down....Every generation has it harder.When old folks used to complain about the good old days and the youngins just thought they were senile are now starting to see things changing very rapidly. Heck I am not that old and I feel like those old guys that complain about how the world is changing for the worse. I have many great childhood memories(most outdoors). Seeing what society is becoming is sad. Kids don't even play in the streets anymore. At least not in the city.
522849,mercman,2010-11-26 00:40:00,7054,"maybe, but i talked to my mom, who is 80, and she says we are lucky today to have all the tecnology and medicine.In her days a mere scratch getting infected could have meant amputation or death. Being able to pick up the phone and talk to familly without having to wait for the neigbors to finish talking (party lines).Painless surgery and her big screen TV She wouldnt trade what she has today for anything in the world."

522858,bigugli,2010-11-26 00:59:00,6138,"Hey! Lay off on the liver and onions. We loved em. pan seared calf liver, medium, served up with a mound of bacon and carmelized onion. When things were real tight we ate lots of P B, and dozens of eggs. Cheap protein with bread. Still love eggs and to this day will dig into the peanut butter jar with a spoon. The one cheap plentiful source of food was our fish. Only fish worth buying at the store was tuna, salmon and pickled herring. I still eat fish 3 days a week. One thing I've learnt in the past year. Being on a limited income, due to health, we've downsized a lot and simplified. Life is getting better just by not having, wanting, or ""needing"" so much stuff. I'm introducing my family to simple, wholesome cooking. No fast food or takeout. No nukem plastic dinners. Supper tonight, a big pot of cabbage soup, topped with a dollop of sour cream, right out of a Scandinavian cookbook. Living in an apartment you cannot collect all the latest fad toys and gimmicks just to let them gather dust. Before moving I loaded an 8 x 15 dumpster full of junk, and probably gave as much to every charity in town. Gave away well over 1000 LP's that were taking up lots of space and gathering dust. I'm feeling a lot happier having made the leap. As things are going to remain tight for the next while, folks are just going to have to learn to prioritize and simplify. Maybe even learn to appreciate all the good things they do have."

From what I read so far,it was simple and relaxed BACK IN THE DAY. Yes there were hard times,just like now for many,but back then,they took the bull by the horns sorta speak,and went on. Lessons most that were willing to learn from,and carry on to this day.  Guess what I am saying is,today we are dealt with rising costs. You have to know yer limits. Live with what you need,and dream about what you wish you could have.     You never know,you just might hit the 1,000,000 dollar dream,and have no worries.LOL"

And yes Brian, balogna is still good but you have to buy the good quality square stuff that doesn't roll off the table. Life and things past, no matter how bad they might have been at the time, will always be better now because they are good memories. We had a milkman who would wake the neighbourhood clanking the milk bottles in his racks every morning.....a breadman who would knock on the door to show us the specials of the day...he also would leave free hot cross buns on our doorstep before Easter every year. We had an ice man who still used a horse to pull his ice load around. My neighbours were called the Yanors. Margaret Yanor was 7 years old ..I was seven as well. She wanted to marry me.  One day, the ice man arrived in the heat of summer and left a block of ice for the icebox on their doorstep. I was trying to fix a fishing rod outside when she called for me to help her put the ice in the icebox. And so I did....made a mess because of it melting all over the kitchen on the way in...it weighed a ton! Mother Yanor was sleeping as usual that afternoon and when she heard me making the racket trying to get the dang huge block up to the upper icebox, she got up and cursed me till I was sure I was going straight to hell.

Call it cabin fever if you like.LOL   With all the talk about the rising costs of gas and hydro, food and what ever,this year 2010,I would like to hear from the ones that are from back in the years. 50,s,60,s or even earllier,even those that were a youngn back then. Back in the day. What was it like for you?  What was it like? Same as today? Rising balloon pricing. I know back in the day, times were tough,but are we in tougher times in your opinion?  I remember as a kid going to the grocery store with grandma,probly was 7-8 yrs old then, and she would say ,32 cents for a can of tuna?    Heck with that,we,ll get balona 15 cents a pound.I loved balona sandwiches with ketchup,still do.  Back in the day at my grandmas, I remember seeing this book and her pealing/licking stamps to fill it. FOODSTAMPS ,,,,,,PAUSING, REFLECTING.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, Back then, being young and not knowing what was what,Im sure like many at that age, we had no idea what was going on in that era. Kids will be kids.  Now that we have grown older,oh and so much wiser   we find ourselves battling pretty much the same thing, this day and age.  No food stamps,but we have coupons to save us money (I do use them). Can a tuna we can find on sale at best,55 cents a can. See grandma,it wasnt that bad of a price   . Balona,well it,s up to $1.55 lb, if you buy the good stuff.LOL  So,are we any different back then, to now?"

I also remember the fear in everyones eyes during the Cuba crisis.We were in Gagetown NB at the military base, and we had to learn how to protect ourselves from possible nuclear attack.We all had gas masks and my brother and eye would scare the crap outta my sister.There was way too much fear back then.We would all line up in school for the polio shots, the small pox vaccine, the TB vacine and films showing nuclear distruction and how to hide under our desks for protection from fallout. And the cold war and communist invasion, agent orange(which took my dads life BTW) DDT, Thalidimide.I sound like Billy Joel  but i lived it and its a wonder that anyone in my age bracket are as stable as we are."

I remember spending my cigarette money on 2 giant round pizza pizza slices and a pop for $2.19!!! And I'm telling you...to give up my smoke money it was delicious. Now that Pizza Pizza made its name and substituted all kinds of crap to make it more profitable? The Pizza sucks......  I remember buying a pair of shoes and it would last 10 years(now lucky if they last a year) and that goes for everything else. Things used to be made to last. Made in Canada and Made in America meant something. Now they are made to break after a few years.

I remember vending machine candy being 75 cents, now it's 1.25. I remember toys made of metal not plastic. I really find merman's post interesting. He pointed out that his generation grew up in constant fear of the unknown. I do not think kids these days have that fear. Whether that is a good thing or a bad thing I do not know. He also mentioned that his parents went without to make sure that he kids got what they needed. I do not think that this attitude is nearly as common, and I think that kids are worse off for it.

522660,bigugli,2010-11-25 14:34:00,6138,"Last time I replied OFC blew up  When I first started working, a pack of smokes was $.85, a cup of coffee .20, a mickey was $2.15/ $2.55 premium. Minimum wage was $2.25 an hr., bumped to 2.55 3 months later. I did not drive, but rode the 'Red Rocket' on a .20 fare. When you broke the $10G barrier per year, you were making good coin. Today you cannot buy a mickey on 1 hour's minimum wage, but just barely buy a good pack of smokes. You could buy a good breakfast at the local greasy spoon for .99. A cheap one egger goes for 2.99 today. As for 'newfie steak' Brian, my Gram would buy the whole log for a whopping $2. We loved fried newfie steak sandwiches. As a kid we did not have a lot, but Gram scrimped and saved to make sure we had good things, like my $30 Mitchell 300A that now hangs on the wall. 40+ years later, I still have the clearest cherished memories of the Christmas presents we got. Twice our best presents came from the Xmas party held by the firefighters at the Junction firehall. Did not know anything about 'brand name' clothes til I started working. As for junk food. Chocolate bars were a nickel. Pop was the same price plus a penny deposit and came from a big red Coke water cooler. Old man Bye had a foot stool for us to stand on so we could see what we were looking for. A big box of fries was $.30 My step father was on the Gardens waiting list for 10 years!!!! We finally got seasons tickets for 1967. Centre ice seats on the very top row at the Gardens. We were actually looking down on Foster Hewitt in the broadcast booth. Would you believe the tickets were $10 a pair!!  I wouldn't pay that much to see them play today Truth is we were better off back then. our world was one of promise and potential. We were not so obsessed with posessing everything as we were with the things we could do and the places to discover."
522669,muddler,2010-11-25 15:20:00,623,"We knew the prices of just about everything at the local grocery store. We used to look for pop bottles and returned them for a refund (2 cents for the little ones and 5 for the big ones). Bought mt Mitchelle 300 (7.95) that way when I was 10. Saturday matinee was 10 cents.  Allowance was for the rich families. We found out that shovelling driveways in the winter and cutting lawns (push mower) in the summer was the way to make money. Selling scrap copper to the scrap yard also produced some cash. Most of the cash went into the family jar(that's where my parents kept the family spending money) but I usually keep 25 cents or so for myself if things were going well in our family for my fishing stuff.  As a teenager, school was our social network. Neighbourhood friends were your summer group. We walked everywhere until we could get a bike. Got my first bike when I was 16. Same year I got my drivers license. Drove a tractor in the fall on weekend working with a local farmer from the age of 12 until I was 18. Got paid in produce, meat and sometimes even a little cash.  I never asked how much I was going to get , I was happy to have a job. You got paid what the farmer could afford.  If I tuned up dad's truck and paid for all the gas I could use it all summer. Did the tune ups myself and it cost $5 or less to fill her up every 2 weeks. I did a lot of fishhing with that old red truck.  Field and Stream, Outdoor Life and Sports Afield were the pipline to new fishing techniques.  We used to read all the adds at the back of the magazines and we'd sent out a pile of requests .  Herter's was the only one that sent a catalogue. I couldn't wait to get my shipment of 8lb test mono (25 lb was the lightest we could get here, then) and the package of No 6 Aberdeen hooks. I still Have my spool of K-58(that was the brand name) 8lb test and the hook box from the aberdeen   hooks.  The metal reel seat and handle grips and extra guide. I was going  to rebuild the 3 piece 8 1/2 ft fly rod into a spinning rod, much to the contrary opion of all my friends. I just read Al Linders article  in a magazine called ""Fishing Facts"" on how to fish for pickerel(walley) using this ultra light gear. Chaged my fishing ever since. Learned about about structure fishing and rod building the hard way. Been building ever since. I only buy a rod as a loner ... it has to be real cheap and on sale.  We knew the price of every lure and box of hooks, good deals didn't last too long and we waited for sales in the off seasons.  The local library was our information highway. Hunting and fishing books were reserved and you couldn't take them out. Had to read them in the library.  we used to hang out at the local tackle store to listen to the ""old"" guys and pick up pointers. ""Secrets"" were very hard to pick up. None of this , ""What gear can I get for $500 so I can go fishing for  XXXXX this weekend. Oh, yeah, where do I go and how do I do it."".  Skills were honed after years of practise .  We got skunked a lot back then. Red Fisher  Show was the only fishing show available. I got my first limit of fish ever when I was 17 after 10 years of fishing every weekend and every day in the summer.  Rods were wrapped in a towel and in the back seat so that they didn't rattle. They lasted longer that way. I still have that first rod I built ove 40 years ago. You took care of your stuff back then. No warranties.  Never let a reel touch the ground, the  sand would wreck the gears. They cost too much anyway. I mean 3.95 for a reel? 7.95 for a Mitchelle...wow.  Worms were 25 cents a dozen. Way too expensive. Picked my own after ever rain fall, still do after 40+ years. Minnows...caught my own. Never bought minnows yet.  Took years to get it all right. These were secrets shared only with the closest of friends.  Bought my 12ft tinny when I was 16 for $100 (my life savings), I got lucky and landed a job at the local A&P and bought a 4hp Merc at 17 for $120 and The local Sears was closing down and I got a rusted trailer for $50 the next year. I still have the same fishing outfit and use it every summer.  Life was good. Always put a little away for fishing no matter what. Still do.  muddler"

Now I still get the jeans I wear for around $20 a pair, so they are way cheaper in comparison now then they were then."

522698,Headhunter,2010-11-25 18:04:00,5703,"I remember as a young boy, I had to have been 5 or 6 years old. My school was having a movie night and myself, my brother and my sister attended. The cost was 5 cents to get in. I recall my sister giving myself and my brother 10 cents each to get a treat. They had many different candies available, but I had my eye on a Mars bar. It was and still is to this day, my favorite candy bar. Sure, they had other candy bars available, but they were 5 cents, the Mars bar was ten. I remember standing there agonizing over the price of the Mars bar... until I finally broke down and bought it... I have never tasted a candy bar that tasted so good! The movie, by the way, was Disney's Jungle Book. I just recently, disposed of my first ever fishing rod, bought and paid with my own money. I remember buying it at Consumers Distibuting, it was a spin caster! I still have the reel I bought for it, paid for with my paper route money... Johnson Century. When I was young, almost everything you bought was either made in Canada or the USA. We used to make fun of things made in Hong Kong or Japan... now everything is made there. My kids will never know the life I had when I was a kid and I don't expect them to. I won't even touch on the subject of the price of beer! HH"
522716,bigugli,2010-11-25 18:53:00,6138,"Capt B, you hit it  right on.  Life was simpler, and simple was good. Our kids and grankids will never enjoy the lives we had as the world has become too complicated and costly. Although, now that I've been downsizing,,,,,, life is simpler and getting better."
522717,misfish,2010-11-25 18:57:00,29133,"  X2  Those century reels could cast a mile HH.   YEAH,lIKE WHATS WITH BUYING A BABIES WASH TUB,,,,,,WITH A SHOWER HEAD??????????? Thats all I got to say about that one."
522723,Beans,2010-11-25 19:08:00,3339,"Maribeth's dad used to say to figure out how long do you have to work to buy a pound of butter...less time now?...then you are better off now than back when...   In the 1940s my mother would send me to the store with a note for a $0.25 package of Player's cigarettes and once she made me take pork chops back to the butcher's shop because he charged us $0.45 for 3 of them and get $0.25 cents worth of ground round instead......Saturday matinees were $0.10 and they gave you a comic book,two features and a cartoon...  I remember some gas station out on Kingston Road (Lion?) near West Hill charged $0.29 for a gallon of gas (early 1950s)  In the mid '50s making $40 a week the wife and baby and I lived in a 2 room upstairs flat for $12 per week and our weekly grocery bill was about the same... Most furniture etc. was bought on the never-never plan...10% down and weekly payments.  "
522727,Harrison,2010-11-25 19:28:00,2202,"I had a chat with an older co-worker yesterday.  We were talking about income vrs expenses nowadays and in the past.  He agreed things may be relative in terms of wages vrs expenses ($5hr then to $30hr today), but also stated back in the day you used less of your income to cover your costs i.e. house costs, utilities etc.  I don't know many friends or family who now have a one income family.  It is just to hard to get by with all the Luxuries we must have.  I do wish life was simpler now, but then again you have to deal with what you are dealt.  My wife actual told me a girl in my daughters school has a cell phone in SK!  I'll continue to teach my girls the about the outdoors and fishing creeks with raw hot dog and bacon chunks for chubs."
522730,tb4me,2010-11-25 19:42:00,3295,"Awesome topic guys! I remember things like the Pop Shoppe. We used to collect empty bottles and return them for the spare cash. Taking the $ to buy tickets for the Dundas Blues Jr.C games. Nan and Pops (dads parents) were the greatest in those days. My Grandfather , who never did learn to read managed to run 3 small business in his lifetime. A landscaping company, a trucking company and a sports store downtown Dundas (R&J Sports). He was also the Trainer for the Dundas Real Mc Coys (late 50's early 60's). My mom’s mom (Nan) lived alone as my Grandfather passed when my Mom was 7. Nan raised 4 kids on her own.3 girl’s one boy. As soon as I was old enough Nan would take me fishing out on the Trent River, where she had a trailer in a local park. Just recently my family bought a trailer in the exact same park and fishes the exact same waters, I learned to fish in. Now with my 3 kids. I too am youngish (36) and can only remember that the simple things were just that. Life was good. Like many others us kids didn’t go without and mom was a stay at home Mom. We too had only one car and it was an old Volkswagen Rabbit. I didn’t notice the real change in the world until George Bush SR invaded Iraq for the first time. If I remember correctly that’s when Gas officially went over the 50 cents a liter mark. You could still get a Big Mac meal for under 5 bux. I now have 3 kids and I so badly wish I could show them how it used to be. Capt Bruce your right it does almost bring a tear to one’s eyes. That’s when times stood still for me and I will never forget those memories. Thanks for allowing me to share!"
