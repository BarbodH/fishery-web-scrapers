This pic shows two strangers getting to know each other... personally, if I had a name like YoungOne, I'd have stayed clear of the big guy (Bitsmith)!  Here they are making plans for later after everyone else passed out! Here they are showing off the ""tools of the trade"" Armageddon!  Here's two old buggers doing their best to find the bottom of a vodka bottle, the whole time watching and learning the art of the take down, from Bitsmith!  The Dr. Mellow even hooked this big guy!  Never and I do mean NEVER pass out in a room full of guys!!!! Gerritt had fun!LOL Thanks for lookin... HH  PS... GBW, the guys in the cabin over a few from us, want your phone number!!!!!"
