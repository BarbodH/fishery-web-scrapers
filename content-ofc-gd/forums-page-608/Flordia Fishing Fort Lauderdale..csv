I have a delemma on hand and was hoping you could make up my mind on what to fish for. I know a lot of you are Bass fisherman out there so this survey might sway towards bass. But I mostly fish for bass here in Ontario and love every chance I get to land that trophy bass ,but the biggest one i've caught is just over 6 lbs. I know in fort lauderdale the chance of catching a 10 lb is good and would be a once in a lifetime to land one of these monsters. But I have always wanted to hook into a monster Tarpon and will never have that chance in Ontario. So what would you suggest , Monster bass or Tarpon. If you have any knowledge of Fort Lauderdale it would be a great help in influencing my decision. I will be hiring a guide so if you know of any quality guides in the area with numbers or emails would be great so I can discuss with them personally. I look forward to your reply and thank you in advance for all you suggestions."

522875,mike hagan,2010-11-26 01:45:00,50,That would be great but I forgot to say I just have one day to fish.
522878,Ben_Daniels,2010-11-26 02:07:00,435,"I lived in Lauderdale for most of my life and I'd say both! Spend some money on a guide for Tarpon and hit any canal or pond for Peacocks and Largies, pretty much any freshwater has bass. Don't expect a 10+ right around Lauderdale, their few and far between in the canals/ponds and even out of holiday park in the everglades you don't see many 10's. If you looking for the dime go more north to Lake O or the Kissimee chain or even St. Johns river. Where in Lauderdale are you going to be? Most of the tackle shop guys will give you some info! Get a bucket of shiners and your set!  -Ben"
522879,timmeh,2010-11-26 02:08:00,609,"A 10lb bass would be awesome, but you're not going to find anything in Ontario that rival a tarpon. But tarpon trips are pricey so be prepared."
522880,Ben_Daniels,2010-11-26 02:17:00,435,"O yea if you don't get out for Tarpon check out 15th Street Fisheries at Lauderdale Marina you can hand feed Tarpon all day, pretty cool having a 6 foot tarpon grab a shrimp outa yer hand!"
522883,bigugli,2010-11-26 02:22:00,6138,"Might not be the right season for targetting tarpon. They tend to be a warm water fish and stay offshore in the cold months.  YOu might be better off shinner fishing for trophy bass that time of year. Also check a couple of party boats in the area, and call down to find out what the best target will be that time of year. maybe cobia, grouper or billfish?"
522914,mike hagan,2010-11-26 03:33:00,50,If i go for bass it will be on lake O . The only guides i've seen are Haughunters not sure of the rep or the quality of the guides.Been talking to the office and offered me brett Isackson???
522940,spincast,2010-11-26 10:33:00,3279,"I was there last year on a company trip. Chartered Marlin My Darlin fishing for --- Marlin. We hooked a 20lb bluefin , a whack of king fish and went 0-2 for Marlin. Unfortunately our 8 hour charter got cut short due to a major storm blowing in and we had to cut the line on the second Marlin  But that was in the fall, too. He said in the spring he fishes for sharks - big sharks."
522998,torco,2010-11-26 16:06:00,656,If tarpon are available to catch and you can get a good guide its seems like the way to go.  Nothing in Ontario compares to tarpon fishing.
523027,scuro2,2010-11-26 17:08:00,904,It is not the tarpon season...you would need perfect weather and a good guide to have a shot at inshore tarpon and you may still be skunked. This time of year I think they are fishing reds. It's great to fish on the ocean but if it is not warm do the bass.
523059,kerr,2010-11-26 18:43:00,77,steve macdonald is a great guide went out twice with his crew to the glades look him up on youtube
523145,mike hagan,2010-11-27 00:19:00,50,Thanks for all your help everybody. Will check out Steve M . Off to do some late Muskie fishing tomorrow . anyone else going out.
