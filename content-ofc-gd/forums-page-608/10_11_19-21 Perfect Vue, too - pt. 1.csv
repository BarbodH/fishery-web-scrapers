(Truthfully, I just feel like I need to get more of my own reports up! )  It was a beautiful calm day in November.  Uncharacteristic, but welcomed.  John and Don met me at my place mid afternoon and we set out to convoy on down to tha Vue.  The sun was low on the horizon lighting up the countryside ahead of us as we approached our destination.    We arrived, checked in, and were losin' light fast.  We did a quick check of the nearby launch, and then the docking facilities at Perfect Vue.  These were LACKING.  Low water didn't help matters, either.  We got settled in, grabbed a burger and headed over to the six-man cabin where the rest of the crew were kickin' it.  Walked in to find that they were in danger of starving.   Luckily, there were lots of alcoholic-type beverages available to sustain us all.  That pretty much sums up Friday night...             So after a few laughs, I was due for another drink.  I headed back to my cabin and found that the beautiful calm November we'd been so fortuitous with, had ceased to be.   No matter.  There was still drinkin' to be done, and rods to be rigged.             Interestingly enough, we did manage to answer the age-old question, 'How many impaired OFNer's does it take to spool up one rod?'... (a: Most of them.)        Well, that's taken care of... who needs a shot?!         All that drinkin' was makin' me thirsty, so I wandered back to my cabin to grab a round for my crew.   Shortly after that, my crew and I decided we'd head back to the non-smokin' cabin for a couple games of crib (I won $5) and to hit the hay.  We were there to fish, and we didn't want to be too Geoff-esque, come mornin'.  Oooh - close match!   Five A M, came early...right around 5am.  Early.  As I dismissed it, the sound of my alarm was replaced by the howl of wind.  Howl.  As in, HOWLING.  It's dark, I'm hung, I'm hungover, and it sounds silly-windy outside.  Let's try again at 6.  Six A M, came early...right around 630am.  Team Marshmallow 4 slowly started draggin' their asses out of their respective cots.  The lil space heater I packed, made gettin outta sac into a toasty warm room, easier.  Donny started the breakfast...  Johnny made up the lunch...  I laid quietly on the couch with my eyes rolled back in my head, drooling.   It was still wicked-windy out by the time we had our ducks in a row.  No matter, we came to fish, so to hell it.  We're goin' big, not goin' home!  Never scared and fish fear me. Yada Blah.  At least it LOOKED pretty.   I've not fished the Bay a lot...  However, FnS took me out last year for my personal best (11.5lbs), I'd been out with Lloyd, Fns, Cliff and Gerry two weeks prior and, for about 6 weeks before hand, I'd been doing all kinds of research and bait-tweakin' and general angler-masturbation in anticipation of the trip, so it was safe to say I had a few ideas about what I wanted to do.  Too many.  I need WAY more time on the water...   Well it wasn't long before Donnie asked where his board was.  Boom.  Nine lb Walter - in the boat!  We were all happy about this - Donny had bought his Crestliner earlier this year and had yet to catch a real fish.  Curse = broken.  And I couldn't help myself, that quick fish made me think we might be in for a banner day.  And that's what jinxed us....  We trolled all over the damn place.  Hard.  Into the breach, dear friends.  I have to say here, that Donny's boat, with the top, and soft windshield that attached at the bow, performed amazingly well.  We should have been a lot wetter than we were (not good-kind).  And we were A LOT drier than a lot of the other guys.  Fishing is always teaching me.  Sometimes the lessons are easy.  I like those lessons.  I couldn't find any concentrations of bait anywhere, nor any hooks (obviously).  I wish I had had WAY more time on the water.  I would have stopped trollin' and just piloted around a while.  That's hard to do when you're time is limited and you really don't think your shipmates would be down for that idea.  That bay always leaves me wanting more.  I had TRAYS of baits I wanted to test - if not just to see how they ran.  I also had baits (stock and customs) that weren't in the bible that I wanted to drag over some flats to figure out their trolling stats.  I NEED MORE TIME!!  Anyways... (see pt.2)"
