How 'bout tell me how many is okay....  Why even limit it?!  It's not even posted here - it's linked out.  And memory is cheap nowadays, N E WAY!  ...  So, anyone know how many pix I CAN post??????????????????????????????????????????????"
522934,bassnass,2010-11-26 07:50:00,174,Ha! Solution!  I'm splitting it up!~  ... I would still like to know what the pic limit is.
523031,irishfield,2010-11-26 17:20:00,26272,Use the post preview button.. and it will show you right away where the limit is. ALWAYS highlight - right click - and copy your post before hitting post or preview!!
