522686,TennesseeGuy,2010-11-25 17:41:00,957,"Chief, we'll do it for sure.  Whopper and I will meet you at a game and maybe hit the park early for lunch in the Machine Room Grille.  I usually miss the opener, but take in the next 3 or 4 games, then come back in early May before walleye season opens up yonder.  After that I make it when I can.  I'm mystyfied that more from Joey's home area don't show interest in his career.  MVP is no small achievement."
