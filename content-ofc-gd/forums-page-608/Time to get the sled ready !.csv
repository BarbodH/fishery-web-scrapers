I put in stabilzer and fogged the engine before i put her away.  Other than checking the belt and changing the chaincase oil, anything else i should look at ?  I have a 2000 Polaris Classic Touring 500.  Thanks !"
523075,fishnsled,2010-11-26 20:14:00,3520,Make sure that everything is greased and that the bearings are good on the track. They can go just from sitting there. A set of new plugs won't hurt.
523078,Rod Caster,2010-11-26 20:20:00,5784,Spoiler alert....it's supposed to warm up next week.
523079,cityfisher,2010-11-26 20:22:00,959,just noticed that ... o well ill get her ready this coming week then with my luck we wont get decent snow till late January
523086,skeeter,2010-11-26 20:50:00,1907,"The clutch's have grease nipples check the track alignment, and for any cracks/rips on the track. check the sliders, wheels for missing rubber, springs,shocks,steering. check the carbides,lights high/low tail and brake.  you might want to check other things that people forget about: how old is your helmet? 10 year life span!!!! what condition is it in? chips/cracks ect.

523090,irishfield,2010-11-26 21:14:00,26272,I pull the cord and go.. is that bad?? LOL  Then again I do all the maintenance BEFORE it sits the summer.  Boogie wheels are the big thing to check.. RIGHT LLOYD !! Have a good look at them all.. any rubber chips? Loosen the track and give them a spin.. bearings?
523106,Terry,2010-11-26 22:30:00,14456,I changed the plugs..boy did it need them
