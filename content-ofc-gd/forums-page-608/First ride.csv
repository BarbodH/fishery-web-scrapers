522672,HTHM,2010-11-25 16:05:00,4082,"I was finally able to launch my boat today with a running motor. This is the restored 1985 370V that i have been working on this year. I launched in Hamilton harbour, and after warm up, I trolled out to the main water and punched it. 3 second hole shot. Top speed is unknown as my GPS is not working right now but I was impressed. Bayfront park to the Skyway bridge in 4 minutes of face freezing exhiliration. Now on to the questions...I had the prop break loose on me twice, (blow out) and the hull swung out and got back in line right away, so I am wondering if I have the motor too high? It is on a 6"" manual jackplate set at I think 3.5"" below the pad. The motor is a 2004 150HP Optimax. Any input is welcome."
522673,DRIFTER_016,2010-11-25 16:09:00,10439,"Check to see where your cavitation plate sits in relation to the bottom of the hull. You want it about 1"" below the bottom of the hull to start and you can adjust from that starting point."
522701,hirk,2010-11-25 18:10:00,571,"3.5 is lots Albert,you either had it over trimmed or are running the wrong prop."
522705,NAW,2010-11-25 18:13:00,4022,So what was wrong with the motor before.  Is this the same one you had issues with a few weeks back?  Sounds like it's all fixed up eh!
522709,HTHM,2010-11-25 18:19:00,4082,"It had a bent pin in the wiring harness that was preventing #4 from firing. As well, two cracked coil drivers and a cracked starter soleniod. It runs like a scalded cat now though...."
522710,HTHM,2010-11-25 18:22:00,4082,"I also need driving lessons, I am afraid of the up trim button."
522785,NAW,2010-11-25 21:54:00,4022, Hope it doesn't sound like that!!
522828,Drew_10,2010-11-25 23:57:00,111,"I would say that you may need different vent plugs on your prop, but if it is blowing out while you are running (ie, not during your hole shot), you could have another problem.  Could be any combination of things."
522835,misfish,2010-11-26 00:10:00,29133,What rpms are you reaching when this happens?
522838,aniceguy,2010-11-26 00:13:00,1094,"Albert what you need to be very aware of is water pressure,RPM's are important for sure its a good and true measure the prop is the right one I think that engine needs somewhere in the 10 to 15 psi ( someone correct me if Im wrong) low water pressure will cause engine failure very quick   The prop breaking out and swinging meant your over trimmed and you lost bite of the propeller. BBC will get you to where the prop should be off the pad and will also get you to the right water pressure, I learned with my other boat that no matter what PSI was the ticket and you can only trim so much  I dont know where you want to go with this rig ( but your restore looked sweet) I didnt see the full merit of a hydro jack plate but a friend amlost insisted I order it with my rig, best choice ever...dial on the fly is frikkin awsome"
522855,Garnet,2010-11-26 00:54:00,2056,"I would pull that prop off and carefully inspect the rubber seal. Some times you can spin a hub slowly, just feels like blow out. Look for little twisted pieces of rubber."
522867,vinnimon,2010-11-26 01:18:00,2593," Congrats on finally getting it out for a good run Albert! Geez I think you could outrun the hwpd with their new boat! Not!LOL! But if you want to check your speed one day, I have a friend whos buddy owns a gps!  for such tasks! LOL! Traet her well, you did a fine job Albert!"
522868,Terry,2010-11-26 01:22:00,14456,I would think he spun the hub
522870,misfish,2010-11-26 01:31:00,29133," If he over trimed,I can see that."
522871,Terry,2010-11-26 01:36:00,14456,when I was buying a used prop the first 2 Paul let me try spun at a certain rpm .the rubber hub inside needed replacing... if I increased speed slowly at those rpms I could go full speed if I hit it too hard she blew
522876,misfish,2010-11-26 01:58:00,29133, Dont hit so hard then.  I see what yer saying. Pressure.
522919,Drew_10,2010-11-26 03:36:00,111,Wouldn't a 150 optimax have a trim limiter?
522926,HTHM,2010-11-26 04:25:00,4082,"I am going to drop the motor, and see if that makes a difference, spun hubs and all that are way to early to diagnose, it has only been run 1/2 hour by a very inexperienced captain. BTW no rubber in the prop either. The fellow who rigged the motor was not the most impressive guy I met. He has a NGD attitude about the whole thing. (NGD = nobody gives a damn)"
523132,aplumma,2010-11-26 23:16:00,6896,I am running the same boat as yours with the 89 Evinrude and a 14.25 x 23  3 blade SS. The Boat really likes to have the motor tucked in the down position for starting out. Once out of the hole at 3/4 throttle tap up a few times (1/2 second each) on the trim control and you will see your speed increase slightly without a raise in rpm. Give it a few more taps till the RPM raise between 25-50 rpms and you have reached the maximum up trim you want to run. If you are in rough water keep it trimmed down and give it 1 second of up it will keep you on the running pad solidly. My boat will run 54 mph at 5500 rpms and 2 people. The Ranger will run very nicely at 38 mph with a dry ride and no kidney punching. If you have some flat water go ahead and trim it up at 1/2 throttle till the rpm raises 25 to 50 rpms then bump it down 1 tap and give it full throttle...Watch the rpms for the motors recomended rpms and then you can tell if you are over/under propped.    art
523135,misfish,2010-11-26 23:29:00,29133,"  After reading this,you need to take your boat to  places that deal with bass boat performance. Paul at TOPGUN, is a great guy.If thats to far for ya,then Extream Marine just off the 407.  You have put alot of work into this boat.Why not get it right with the ones that know."
