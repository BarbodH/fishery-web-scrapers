522938,highdrifter,2010-11-26 08:29:00,2534," Could be..  Last spring, I seen this one swan trying to mount this poor goose..  Goose was trying to get away and this here swan cornered him and had his way wit him.  Wings were flapping around and everything..  It was quite a show!!  Actually that looks to be an immature Mute swan.  I know the two birds at the top are Mutes.   Quite aggressive and territorial, compared to our Trumpeters."
523013,Aaron Shirley,2010-11-26 16:43:00,655,Sounds like you had a good time. Great photos too.
523017,Joey,2010-11-26 16:55:00,9122," Cool, thanks for the info birdman"
522333,Joey,2010-11-22 23:15:00,9122,"Paul and I headed down to the BOQ on Thursday afternoon late and arrived around 6:30 p.m.  Terry and Lloyd had invited us to dinner, but it was too late by the time we got there so we invited them over to our cabin for a chat.        After they left Paul and I met some funny people around the fire and chatted with them the rest of the night.  Friday was our best day and the weather was decent.  We headed straight past the ferry and Paul got to use the new boards      Our fish finder is set on fish, not hook (we prefer it that way), and this looked promising, although too deep for us.  We don't fish that deep (kill zone).  It sure looked like a good sign with that many fish feeding on a bait ball.      Not long after the first line goes off and I reeled in this beauty.  Not my PB, but my actual second only fish on BOQ      Paul was up next with this nice 11 pounder (obviously not his PB either   )     Another line goes off some time later and this one did not fight like a pickerel, which it was not.  But it was a half decent pike. First one for me on the BOQ.       Ever get the feeling someone is watching you hahahaha.             These guys flew by us a few times during the day.       That was it for Friday and we headed in so we could meet Terry, Lloyd, Jose and Paul at Gus's Restaurant in Picton.      Here is Jose's mouse turd pie     We had a group shopping trip at Giant Tiger after that and then the guys gave us a tour of Picton Harbour Inn, which was pretty nice.  We watched a wrestling Tapout match and then headed back to Merland's for another night around the fire.  We all know what Saturday brought us, which is high winds.     Now Paul did manage to get a really nice pike on in this mess, a 12 pounder or more, and as I went to net it, the net malfunctioned and for some reason bonked the pike right in the head, knocking the lure out of its mouth.  I hate when nets go bad  Saturday night was the G2G at JJ's Smokehouse and it was great.  Lloyd tried potstickers for the first time and liked them   It was great seeing the guys again and also meeting Team Orangepeel!!!!!  Great laughs guys.  Sunday was not much better for wind and a very, very slow day for us.  I took some random pics in my boredom.       This barge has seen better days.    We ended up with one perch for Sunday from 9 a.m. to 4:30 p.m.     But it was nice to be out on the water and we had a wicked ride back over the crosswaves.  Paul's offshore boating experience came in handy and it was a blast  This morning we woke up to rain and fog so we decided to head back early instead of fishing for today.  We might head back up for a night in the next few weeks.  So all in all it was a great G2G, even tho Lloyd stole all our fish  Here Lloyd and the boys heading off into the sunset    Cheers,  Joey"
522338,Terry,2010-11-22 23:28:00,14456,great report and photos  always great to see you guys

522348,aplumma,2010-11-22 23:54:00,6896,Looks like a good time except for them fishin pirates that was eyeing you fishin places...   Art
522356,Joey,2010-11-23 00:08:00,9122,"Ya, really unfortunate that you couldn't join us as planned Roy, we missed your company for sure."
522360,Rizzo,2010-11-23 00:22:00,4754,"looks like a great time, thanks for taking the time to share it!"
522362,LeXXington,2010-11-23 00:27:00,1928,Great to see you and Paul again. Always a pleasure.  Love the pictures from your camera WOW>>  See you at the next G2G.  Oh and Terry is really looking forward to have the BOQ G2G trophy.. All he could do was talk about it after he smoked us with his 14lber ..
522367,Joey,2010-11-23 00:35:00,9122,"  Its funny Paul, I use the two cameras all day long.  I leave the zoom on the T2i for the far away shots and then use the old Canon for the closer shots so I dont have to change lenses on the T2i, but some are just fluke.  Like the swans.  I was fooling around with the zoom on the older canon and was focusing on waves in the distance and the boat was rocking up and down and I see some white things go by so I just snapped the pic and it refocused on the birds instead.  I couldn't believe it."
522368,Joey,2010-11-23 00:41:00,9122," Well he's in luck.  We talked about that too, his 14 lber winning and we will be bringing it to our first meeting with him on Lake Simcoe for ice fishing, we'll even bring bungee cords so he can strap in onto the front of his sled"
522371,Rich Clemens,2010-11-23 00:49:00,3131,"Very nice.  I keep sayin' that I'd like to make the trip up there sometime.  Who knows, maybe it will be in the cards one of these years.  Glad ya all had such a great time."
522375,Whopper,2010-11-23 00:54:00,2174,"Good report, sounds like you two had a good time  You did good on the pictures  ""Nice Fish"""
522380,Handlebarz,2010-11-23 01:17:00,3790,great report Joey looks like a great time was had and some great fishing
522381,Terry,2010-11-23 01:18:00,14456,  You..... bad person.....LOL   My religion doesn't allow me to have trophys...something about false idols   but I hear Lloyd would hold it in my stead     LOL
522400,fishhunter,2010-11-23 01:57:00,604,"Like always it was a blast hooking up with you two. Those are great pics!! No more pre flash please I'm still seeing spots lol  Well ice fishing is just around the corner and will give you both an invite to my honey hole lake first ice up for Monster Walleye, Lakers and white fish. You can bring the trophy that weekend for Terry lol Ill even help him put it in his truck"
522408,fishnsled,2010-11-23 02:17:00,3520,"Great report Joey, very nice pics. Too bad that ""other boat"" took all your fish.  I hate those net malfunctions as well."
522410,fishhunter,2010-11-23 02:23:00,604," We only took then for a few pics, then put them back for others to enjoy"
522412,Joey,2010-11-23 02:24:00,9122," Likewise Lloyd, and you got a deal on the honey hole lake first ice up, that sounds great, can't wait.  Oh, and I'll leave the preflash camera for the fish pics    Thanks Will, a new net might be in order, that one sucks      Thank you everyone for the great replies"
522419,fishnsled,2010-11-23 02:31:00,3520, 
522519,bigbuck,2010-11-23 15:56:00,2449,Looks like you guys had a great time even though you had high winds on Sat and Sun. Catching fish can sometimes be secondary to the great fellowship.
522521,Rod Caster,2010-11-23 16:03:00,5784,Fun report. BOQ is magnificent
522846,Leecher,2010-11-26 00:36:00,7832,Great report and pics Joey Sweet reward for your efforts considering mother nature's nasty sense of humour Doesn't get any better than that Thanks for sharing your time on the water!!! Leechman

522904,Joey,2010-11-26 03:08:00,9122," Thanks hon, speaking of birds, in the swan shot, doesn't the bottom one look like a goose was messin with a swan and that is their offspring?"
