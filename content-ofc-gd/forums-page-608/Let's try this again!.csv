523048,lew,2010-11-26 17:59:00,12766,"Still real breezy around these parts with the odd snow flake thrown in and just to be on the safe side,  I had the winter tires put on this morning.  Been working outside for the last couple hours and   the cool temps make doin chores alot easier than the hot steamy summer we just went thru, and with all the leaves gone it sure makes trimming trees that much simpler."
