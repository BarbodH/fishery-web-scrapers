I recall being told they were sighted in the bay here acouple of times. I did see something strange a couple of years ago out there. Water was like glass and out of no where,theres a large swill like roller.like a boat had past. Im at work so I aint drink,n of smoken, anything.  Anyone else ever heard of this?"

522535,Terry,2010-11-23 17:06:00,14456,"it has been years sense the MNR have found any while doing netting, so they state that they are no longer in simcoe  but I would think there has to be a few  it would be nice if they came back in big numbers"
522538,mercman,2010-11-23 17:11:00,7054,"I'm not sure, but i bet its true.The great lakes and the seaway are prime sturgeon waters.I know one thing that happened to me this past summer on the St Lawerence where i fish. Drift fishing in 30 feet of water, i got a shallow depth alarm that lasted for about 5 seconds.Thought i saw a dark shadow out of the corner of my eye,  but I'm not positive. So Yes, there must be some HUGE sturgeon out there."

522558,mercman,2010-11-23 18:58:00,7054," Someone said the same thing when i first posted it, but i cant see that here in montreal. too far from salt water."
522568,Mike Pike,2010-11-23 19:45:00,1332,"Bull Sharks are capable of going into freshwater rivers.  As a matter of fact, I believe I recall reading of a shark being caught by ice fishmen several years back on the Saguenay River that flows into the St. Lawrence."
522761,mercman,2010-11-25 21:04:00,7054, I think you mentioned the same thing this past summer. Thats a scarey thought man.
522773,Roy,2010-11-25 21:42:00,13728," The Sag is a little salty. there's halibut, cod and shark in there all the time."
522873,Dave Bailey,2010-11-26 01:38:00,1641,"I read somewhere years ago that a bull shark had been caught as far up the Mississippi River as Alton, Illinois. That's one helluva distance from salt water."
522885,Muskieman,2010-11-26 02:24:00,2472,Why wouldn't there be Sturgeon in Simcoe?  People catch Sturgeon by accident in many lakes.  I've seen 60lb Sturgeon come out of Lk. Temagami in 1988.  There could be a good population is Simcoe and no one would know.  Apparently not much is know about the Lake Sturgeon.   Randy
