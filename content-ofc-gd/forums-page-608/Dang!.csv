522659,TJQ,2010-11-25 14:34:00,7806,"Looks like they have moved us to another server again.. said it was a hardware issue.. Even with the hiccups, were still up 99 percent of the time, its just sucks when it goes down. Seems pretty quick to me today. I think what happens, (although its hard to get this from the isp) is that they have more than one client on a particular server and load that server up to capacity and every 6 months or so strange things happen and some ""larger' clients need to be moved. I imagine going to our own managed server would help, but that is cost prohibitive. Why don't we change just ISP's you ask, well we host with the same people that designed the software, so that there can be no blame game.. i.e. the host telling us its the software causing the problem, and then the software designer telling us its a hardware problem, nothings perfect...."
