523284,fishinfool,2010-11-27 17:00:00,366,"Here's a solution to all the controversy over full-body scanners at the airports:  All we need to do is develop a booth that you can step into that will not X-ray you, but will detonate any explosive device you may have hidden on or in your body. The explosion will be contained within the sealed booth.  This would be a win-win for everyone. There would be none of this crap about racial profiling and the device would eliminate long and expensive trials, let alone speed up and simplify the whole traveling experience.  This is so simple that it's brilliant. I can see it now: you're in the airport terminal and you hear a muffled explosion. Shortly thereafter an announcement comes over the PA system, ""Attention, standby passengers! We now have a seat available on flight number...""  Works for me! SS<br style=""""> <br style="""">"

523359,skeeter,2010-11-27 22:56:00,1907,"YES, but would they atleast hose out the booth before the next person? would there be a camera in the booth so we can see the last look on his/her face? just asking !!!!!"
