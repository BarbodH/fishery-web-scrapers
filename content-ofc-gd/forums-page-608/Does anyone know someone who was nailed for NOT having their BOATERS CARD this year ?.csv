522481,jbailey,2010-11-23 12:51:00,866, yesss so i'm not alone so embarassing ahaha could see the jackets just laying there on the dock
522930,Afraz,2010-11-26 05:25:00,250,"My buddies were fishing out of an inflatable, had their boaters card. Got slammed with a 280 dollar ticket for not having a Saftey Kit and Lights on their boat They were fishing on Scugog in the afternoon.  The Safety kit i can understand (spent 65 bucks and picked one up from canadian tire) but where would i mount any sort of lights on my inflatable ? So i can avoid what happened to them :S"
522931,BFSC Kevin,2010-11-26 05:48:00,1351, HOw about something like this? I think I saw this at west marine or canadian tire.. 
522954,Woodsman,2010-11-26 13:11:00,1286,"Are you sure they didn't get charged for no working flashlight? Right from the Safe Boating Guide(TP 511E) Navigation lights Only required if the boat is operated after sunset, before sunrise or in periods or restricted visibility(fog, falling snow, etc.)."
523029,irishfield,2010-11-26 17:17:00,26272,"What Woodsman said... no need to have lights on your boat during the day, I never have mine installed on my lund during daylight. Hell, I'm not even sure where I tucked the rear light pole away to.  They got nailed for not having a working flashlight!  Also.. many get nailed as they still have that orange bailing bucket wrapped in the shipping plastic. Right away they know your flashlight doesn't operate as the batteries aren't in it when shipped!  As for the boaters card... everyone in the household had one this summer just hoping to get pulled over to show it off. First year in 6 on the water of Temagami that they didn't seem interested in doing boat inspections... not pulled over once.. just waved to, or horn tooted to, a dozen times or more."
522148,jediangler,2010-11-22 01:47:00,1923,"I sold my Sportspal to frozen-fire on this board and went kayak only for the last few years. Even powered by an electric trolling motor I would have had to get the card. Now if I want to fish in a bigger boat I just rent and don't need the card. This is such an obvious money grab. When I was on Scugog last year the OPP came checking two boats near me but didn't bother me in the kayak. I could hear one guy asking the officer why he doesn't check me out as well but I couldn't hear his answer. I hope you all know this isn't the end of the money grab as I'm sure new regs will soon come in to tax you on the size of your motors for ""environmental impact"". Just don't be surprised when it happens."
522160,Guest gbfisher,2010-11-22 02:36:00,0," I thought was where you took the test. Some of them are registered and some of the tests are not.   Just what I heard is all.  I have 4 cards as my orignal lost its writting. Rubbed off, go figure. One in the boat, one in my wallet, one left at home...and one in my wifes purse.(don't ask about that one)"
522162,mercman,2010-11-22 02:41:00,7054,"  You know i have to ask, don't ya."
522163,danc,2010-11-22 02:49:00,4677,I got my card at a resort near Red Lake at the 11th hour this year. I was told that I was guaranteed to pass for a case of beer. Worked for me.
522165,spinnerbaitking,2010-11-22 02:52:00,1622,"My father was asked last Nov in Wiarton & he didn't have it ,they let him off & after that he never took his boat out until he got it this spring with a bunch of older gentle men, they wouldn't have got off twice Richard"
522195,mbac31,2010-11-22 11:26:00,904,"No offense but they should not have to look it up. You could give them anyones name. Same reason they wont look up a drivers licence. Carry it with you and you wont have any problems. Plain and simple.  I got stopped on Quinte by a not so nice Female officer with an attitude one morning this summer. She even checked my Fire extinguisher. I had to give her copy of insurance, Bill of sale for boat,Boat registration papers, all safety gear including Flares. Fishing Licence and Boaters card.  I had more then I needed and everything was in a neat little package. I was wearing my life jacket as I usually do and she was a little angry to say the least. I had told her please come aboard and find something as I would love to know if I had something out of place. I preceeded to calm her down by giving her a coffee from my thermos. She then chuckeled and said if everyone was like you ,my job would be easy. I told her that if that was the case she would be doing it from a desk.  Goes to show she like everone else can have a bad day. Maybe she had allready fined a bunch of guys for leaving it in the truck.  Luck they didnt ask for all the stuff mentioned above. This stuff needs to be carried also. Same guys who complain about these guys doing their job are the same guys that complained that something needed to be done before. Who cares if its a cash grab. Something got done about it and Im sure people got a little more responseable for it. You will always find the usuall idiot racing around and the card wont fix that, they usually fix themselves and make the papers. Sadly in the wrong section but it is what it is. Piont in case, if you have the card carry it, and all required safety gear. Then you will have a great day of fishing."
522197,craigdritchie,2010-11-22 11:32:00,1586,Uh huh. The onus is on the boat operator to produce the card when asked to do so. End of story.
522204,Billy Bob,2010-11-22 12:55:00,5865,I'm exempt from the money grab because I'm a American....  
522205,mbac31,2010-11-22 13:02:00,904,   Just wait till they need to start finding ways to make back that money loaned out last year.
522211,Billy Bob,2010-11-22 13:17:00,5865,I think they already have by increasing your electric rates....
522212,Fish Farmer,2010-11-22 13:18:00,2234,"There is no central data base for the operators card. I wonder if this went to court and you had a lawyer, what would happen if you said you lost your card. Just a thought."
522214,Woodsman,2010-11-22 13:22:00,1286,"Well maybe not not necessarily. Your only exempt if it's your own boat which has been in Canada less than 45 consecutive days. If the boat is not registered in your name or left in Canada at your cottage for the season, you are not exempt from the proof of competency rules."
522215,Woodsman,2010-11-22 13:31:00,1286,"Not legally required to have insurance for a boat or to carry proof of insurance even if you do have it. I'm not saying, ""it's a good idea to not have insurance"" just that it isn't legally required, or at least yet.  Rick"

522222,Guest gbfisher,2010-11-22 14:05:00,0,"  lol...Ya....my names different than all the other info I just handed over. ins,ownership,bill of sale,fishing license, registration. Yup....the names Clod and this is someone elses boat and I carry all of their info with me.... except their license which they keep in their wallet... ..Unfortunately they can't check so it seems but could give people 24 hours to produce."
522224,DRIFTER_016,2010-11-22 14:28:00,10439,I wonder what happens if I come South to boat? I live in the NWT the only province/territory that doesn't require you to get the card.  I've had my card for about 10 years but it would be fun to see what happened if I got stopped and said I didn't have or need one because of where I lived.
522229,Billy Bob,2010-11-22 14:52:00,5865," Morning Woody, I knew that....it was more of a tongue in cheek response."
522231,stubbex1,2010-11-22 15:00:00,164,"I got pulled over on the French this past summer pulling the nieces and nephews on the tube.  They kindly waited until the kids were off the tube and in the boat before they stopped me.  They checked for life jackets, bail bucket and flashlight, and asked me for my card.  I had left my wallet in the cottage, and let it go at that and gave all the kids a little package of rockets for wearing their life jackets!  They stopped me later that afternoon while i was fishing and checked my card out.  I think they are a little more concerned that the kids were safe etc rather than the op. card."
522232,craigdritchie,2010-11-22 15:15:00,1586,"What would happen is the judge would say, sorry friend, but the onus is on you to produce it when asked. You can pay your $300 fine at the clerk's desk on the way out."
522269,rapala14,2010-11-22 18:34:00,44,"I got stopped 4 or 5 times this year.  Once by the MNR and the rest by the OPP.  MNR has always been very pleasant to deal with.  Never had a problem with them.  I've had the odd OPP officer power tripping/having a bad day or something, once or twice.  Had one tell me he was going to give me a ticket for not having my lights on... and the sun was still up.  Ended up just giving me a warning"
522284,Sinker,2010-11-22 19:21:00,8692,"I've never been asked for it. I did however get asked to show my anchor one time. The OPP officer was ""pretty sure"" that my floating rope attached wasn't legal, and wanted to give me a fine for something. I showed him my back up anchor with a non floating rope, so he let me go with a ""warning"". I had to ask him if he wanted to see my boaters card!!! I guess he lost his train of thought with the floating anchor rope?? I dunno LOL  s."
522286,jbailey,2010-11-22 19:35:00,866,20ft from the dock tickets for no life jacket on a peddelboat lol  never been checked for boats card
522301,POLLIWOGG,2010-11-22 21:07:00,835,"JBZ they nabbed a guy for that on Quinte....He would take the peddle boat from the dock past the weed line for a swim, no jacket."
522310,fishermccann,2010-11-22 22:06:00,655,"If you have on your lifejacket on a paddleboat, then you do not need all the other stuff, bailer, flashlight,  etc."
522344,Woodsman,2010-11-22 23:50:00,1286,Be prepared to get nailed. The exemption that you speak of only applies (or at least currently) when your in the Northwest Territories or Nunavut. Also applies to anyone resident or not in the Northwest Territories or Nunavut.
521957,darsky,2010-11-21 15:00:00,586,just curious if its actually being enforced and what is the typical fine for not having one
521958,aniceguy,2010-11-21 15:03:00,1094,"I have been stopped twice, both times the first question asked after alchol was did I have the card"

522007,spooner_jr,2010-11-21 18:05:00,193,That's like needing a license to use a lawnmower.
522009,irishfield,2010-11-21 18:07:00,26272,Give it time Spooner.. give it time..  you need one to operate a chainsaw if you aren't on your own property!
522015,POLLIWOGG,2010-11-21 18:47:00,835,"Heard one the other day......two pontoon boat were tied together on the lake at night and a motor boat crashed into them, I think the story went that the guy driving the boat claimed they didn't have lights on but everyone else claimed different. The guys with the pontoon boats were charged for not having the card."
522017,mercman,2010-11-21 18:50:00,7054,"I like to believe that the reasoning behind this whole permit thing so to try and educate people and keep the asses off the water.But realistically i think its a money grab. Its too easy for idiots to cheat, having the test online.It took me twice to pass it, but thays good because now i know what i didnt before.I have had people offer me money to do the test for them.I said no, but how many others said yes.So now the idiots have cards too.Does that make them boaters or certified idiots"
522025,lookinforwalleye,2010-11-21 19:11:00,4399,"IMHO the boaters card and the exam are a joke, a couple of years ago I was approached by one of the cuties a Bass Pro she asked if I wanted to get my card I said no thanks, she then went on to say that there are people inside to help you write the test and everyone passes. I think it`s a good idea for boaters to know what the heck they are doing on the water but the Boater Exam is a joke all it`s done is make the McNammee`s millionaires."
522032,Garry2Rs,2010-11-21 20:29:00,1425,"There is no mystery here.  Ten or twelve years ago there were a rash of accident involving Sea-Do's.  The Province was under pressure to do something!  They didn't want to ban these toys because that would negatively effect business, and they couldn't set rules for any one specific part of the population...IE. children and teenagers.  So the ""Card"" was a measured response.  It showed the government was concerned, and was doing something about the problem...It started by excluding children as operators, then made young adults take a test and get a card, showing they knew the rules of the waterways.  To avoid charges that they were ""targeting minor's"" or ""profiling young people"" etc. the law provided that everyone operating a watercraft would need to acquire an operator's card over a period of about ten years.  Exceptions were made for tourists...after all we didn't want to negatively effect business...WINK-Wink.  Is it stupid?  Sure it is!  The proof is that in the 11th hour they were all but giving the cards away.  In the Kawarthas, where I live, you could take the test at the grocery store!  Coached tests in stores were rumored all over and there was only an Honour System if you took the test on-line.  Did it do any good?  I don't know, but it didn't hurt."
522035,Woodsman,2010-11-21 20:44:00,1286,Garry it's actually Federal Legislation not Provincial.
522036,EC1,2010-11-21 20:44:00,930,"I've been asked for my boating card twice so far this year. Once on Cameron, and once on a back lake. They never really gave us a problem, and were pretty nice when we saw them.  It seems weird that I never got checked on Rice or Scugog when I was out on the lake though. Scugog did see a huge amount of CO's checking for the shore fisherman though."
522058,Garry2Rs,2010-11-21 22:01:00,1425,"Sorry; I should have said ""The Government"""
522082,Dara,2010-11-21 22:50:00,3052,"I never got checked. I had one funny one thouugh. I was taking the boat out of the water at our town launch and the OPP pulled up with their boat on a trailer. They wandered around and saw me and since I was along they kindly asked if I needed help. I do it all the time so I declined. I winched the boat on and then hooked up the safety chain. The cop says...ohhhhh, thats a good idea. It was hard to not to mention that his buddies in Barrie could have used one this summer."

522091,BIG FISH,2010-11-21 23:02:00,54,"i got nabbed this year, i left my wallet in the truck wich had my card in it, ive had my card for a while and ive never been checked. i was fishing about 30 yards off shore in front of the boat launch and i explained to the officer i can go to shore right now and get it and that i just forgot it in the car. but it didnt matter to him he was giving me the ticket no matter what i was nice to him and everything but he was being a a real prick. and he gave me a $350 ticket, after he gave it to me he sayed to me ""your going into shore now and not coming back"" he said ""your fishing trip is over"", i said ""well what if i go get my card i can come back out then"", and he replied ""if you come back out we will arrest you and we have you on radar so dont try any little detours"". then he said to me ""start your motor so that i know you will get back to shore"" so i turn the key and motor fired right up then he says "" you might want to take that in for a tuneup "" and i replied ""why is that"" he replied ""well it doesnt exactly purr like a kitten now does it"" so anyway we went in and took the boat out of the water and i got stuck with a $350 ticket in one hand and boaters card in the other, guess they have to pay for that 3/4 of a million dollar boat somehow"
522112,lookinforwalleye,2010-11-21 23:30:00,4399,  Just curious what in the world was he going to arrest you for if you came back out legal??Surely there is more to the story!  I have been stopped numerous times by the MNR and various regionals on the water and have never had a bad experience but my boat and papers are always in order.
522117,BIG FISH,2010-11-21 23:35:00,54,  i did not have a re boarding device on the boat (ladder) he didnt fine me for it but i got home and read the book and it says if your boat sits 20 inches above the water line then you need a ladder but since im in a bassboat i sit about 15 inches above the water so i dont even need one
522119,camillj,2010-11-21 23:37:00,1988,wow that sounds a little aggessive to me ... I hope you told that story in court when you fought the ticket.

522140,Guest gbfisher,2010-11-22 00:56:00,0,I know of two people who were given $350 fines for not having it on their person. The OPP can look it up and they should.
522141,irishfield,2010-11-22 00:58:00,26272,There is no registry for it Andy.. TTBOMK they can't look it up. Wanna buy a card?
