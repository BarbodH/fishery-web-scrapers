522764,Pigeontroller,2010-11-25 21:15:00,2793,That is an excellent video showing real some good release technique!
522827,wkrp,2010-11-25 23:56:00,656,Just picked up a pair from Lowes in Newmarket today  $ 54.21 taxes in. Model # 71 31 200 .
522832,GBW,2010-11-26 00:04:00,8460,No prob.  I have to wait till Christmas to find out what one's I get....
522888,irishfield,2010-11-26 02:25:00,26272,3 pairs left in the Barrie store. Tomorrow I modify mine for an opener spring....
523104,irishfield,2010-11-26 22:22:00,26272,"So.. with nothing better to do today.    I added a compresion spring that I had around the shop, by slipping the ends in under the handle covers and staking in place with some super glue I had on hand. Figured while I was at it.. drilled the handle and added a 6 foot x 1/16th aircraft cable and a nice brass lever end to snap around any handy track accessory screw.  "
523112,wkrp,2010-11-26 22:35:00,656,Great idea irishfield.Was the handle easy to drill?
523116,irishfield,2010-11-26 22:38:00,26272,I tried it in the drill press first. .. and wasn't getting anywhere other than a bent bit. Did it by hand with a new 3/32 bit in the cordless and it was effortless. Guess I grabbed a dull bit the first round!  Anyone else want this done to your cutters... drop by CTC and buy the brass lever snap.. I  have everything else here at cost!
523210,wkrp,2010-11-27 06:18:00,656,Thanks for the warning .
521020,farsider,2010-11-17 21:07:00,456,"For those who are still looking for a pair of Knipex Bolt Cutters to have as part of their essential release tools...  I have seen them in stock at two separate Lowes stores in the GTA (Major Mack and Bathurst, Caledonia and Castlefield) along with more Knipex items.  They are found alongside the other electrical tools in the electrical aisle.  $47.99  Cheers,  Mark"
521022,irishfield,2010-11-17 21:09:00,26272,Thanks Mark.. I'll have to hit the Lowes in Barrie and have a look around.
521029,lew,2010-11-17 21:35:00,12766,"That's an excellent price, I payed around $60 three or four years ago."
521032,Handlebarz,2010-11-17 21:46:00,3790,Heck that is the same price that LOWES in the USA sells them for that is a great price as some stores sell them for $60-$80. There is usually a booth at the MCI Odyssey that has them for $40 that is where I got mine and at that price I could not say no.
521089,NAW,2010-11-18 01:46:00,4022,  Wayne.  Let me know if they have them at the Barrie Lowes for that price..  I'll swing by and grab a pair too!
521100,esoxansteel,2010-11-18 02:26:00,1307,"Put a tether strap on those babies as you dont want to watch 40.00 plus HST go over board, and hook a muskie after the fact with the cutters on the lake bottom, I have 2 pairs one on each side of the boat, and a monserous pair of bolt cutters with dull blades to cut the walnuts out of the person who tries to steal them"
521103,Rizzo,2010-11-18 02:39:00,4754, ...that made me laugh and cringe at the same time
521106,thatleetboy,2010-11-18 02:43:00,143,"It's not obvious to me what these are specifically required for, although I seem to remember a post about someone getting a triple hook stuck in their hand, and not having the right tool...  Noob questions: why do I need these?  Is there a specific model number?   Thanks."
521108,fishnsled,2010-11-18 03:11:00,3520,They only have the 71 01 200 for bolt cutters. After looking it may have been these. Any thoughts on these 2 cutters?
521113,GBW,2010-11-18 03:37:00,8460,I too would like to know what ones the store has and what are the right ones to get.
521114,Pigeontroller,2010-11-18 03:39:00,2793," I just cut the hooks on the Muskie I caught Tuesday, she had the lure sideways in her mouth, a couple points up and down, mouth essentially locked tight. Add to this 2-3 foot chop and It would have been real tough to remove the hooks...I was able to cut them in about 1o seconds and the fish was back in the net underwater...Put new hooks on the Grandma(lure) and was trolling it again in minutes!"
521116,TC1OZ,2010-11-18 03:43:00,987," Sometimes you deep hook a muskie, rather than hurting it by keeping it out of the water and screwing about in its mouth, you just cut the hook to keep your lure and release the fish quicker!"
521117,GBW,2010-11-18 03:45:00,8460,"Dax, can you help out as per the one`s fishnsled posted if they are the correct ones, thanks."
521118,spoon,2010-11-18 03:55:00,74,"Knipex are a must, if you don't have them=don't even try fishing for musky.  My friend and I have had 2 muskies this past weekend that had 3 points of the treble in their mouth. Just like Pigeontroller has mentioned, their mouths were completely shut. Using Knipex we had to cut everything off, split ring and all points of the treble. Knipex saved those fishes lives, and they were back in the water under 30 Seconds  also, get a nice big net, not those small, tail splitting nets.  These Knipex that Lowes have are the ones you need, nothing else even comes close to Knipex  Tight Lines  Here is a nice video showing how fast muskies get stressed...  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrKGuUdR-7k&feature=player_embedded"
521175,bigbuck,2010-11-18 14:24:00,2449,"Yeah, I was the one who helped out the guy who had two trebles in his hand. You need these because they can cut a 4/0 hook like nothing. It's a safety thing, safe for the fish  and safe for you if you need to cut hooks in a hurry and if you spend any time at all musky fishing, you will need to cut hooks at some point. Regular fishing pliers or needlenose are not up to the task."
521276,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-11-18 21:23:00,0,Thanks for the heads up. Gonna go check it out.
521280,Pigeontroller,2010-11-18 21:34:00,2793,"Those look like the same ones I use, though mine are spring loaded...As stated, they are handy for cutting hooks that are in humans too!"
521281,Pigeontroller,2010-11-18 21:37:00,2793,
521295,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-11-18 22:17:00,0,"I got those pliers at Lebarons.Bass pro shops were selling these monster spreaders(with the T at the bottom), but they were out last time I checked."
521297,GBW,2010-11-18 22:45:00,8460,Thanks Dax!!!!
521298,wkrp,2010-11-18 22:47:00,656,"The last time that this topic was brought up, someone had a great way to keep these in the boat and not on the lake bottom. I did a search but was unable to find it."
521300,GBW,2010-11-18 22:54:00,8460,it was Lew and he said the following... 
521561,TennesseeGuy,2010-11-19 20:49:00,957,"Just picked up mine at our local Lowes store for $39.97.  First I had to convince the employee that they carried Knipex brand.  They weren't in the boltcutter section, but we found them in the electic department.  I got the last one and it was half hidden.  The guy mentioned that another shopper had been looking for the same thing, for the same use.  He didn't get it and I did.  Previously I've carried a cheaper boltcutter from Tractor Supply.  It did the job, but rusted badly.  My pliers, boltcutter and jaw spreader stay beside me on the boat seat for the whole trip, whether 1 week, 2 weeks or 3 weeks.  Lots of chance to rust."
521585,wkrp,2010-11-19 21:46:00,656,Thanks for finding that GBW and its a great tip from Lew
522746,spoon,2010-11-25 20:20:00,74,Another very nice Video
