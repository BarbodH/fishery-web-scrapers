522683,bigfish1965,2010-11-25 17:03:00,3382,"We finally got the info back. We had a total hardware failure. Anyone who has ever tried to recover a bad hard drive can tell you, it is not an easy task. So on their Thanksgiving, our hosts managed to pluck out all the files and finally the database to move us to a new host. In spite of the claims to the contrary, it was definitely not a hack."

522749,Gerritt,2010-11-25 20:24:00,6129, LOL! in this case RAID stands for Redundant Array of Independent Discs
522760,mercman,2010-11-25 20:59:00,7054,  I stand corrected. Then it should be RAOID. NO?
522763,Terry,2010-11-25 21:10:00,14456,and then that would be the FBOI and not the well known FBI
