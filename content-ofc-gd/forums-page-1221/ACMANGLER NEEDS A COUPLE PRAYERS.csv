68104,Roy,2007-05-05 18:05:00,13728,"There's a trick to preemies. You MUST be there with them. They have to feel that you are there....touch them, talk to them. My youngest was born in '82 at 25 weeks. She was born at the Royal Victoria hospital.....I learned quickly how all of that equipment works...like the C-Pap unit for example. God bless the great, dedicated people who work there.  Helene is 25 years old now and  just a super daughter.  Your situation will go well, just BELIEVE!"
68105,Tarzan's Jane,2007-05-05 18:14:00,1183,God is good - prayers and thoughts are with you all.
68445,BLACKFISH88,2007-05-07 00:12:00,191,"Well Mom is home and she says that Jen hasnt had any contractions since fri night, but she is still dialated they say the baby is only between 2-3lbs but everyday it gets better. Apparently this could go on for months they say. So we will be making trips to Mt. Sinai often to keep Andy company. He has no bed and cannot afford to stay in a motel for that amount of time, they gave him a lounge chair to sleep in. Thanks again to everyone for prayers and votes of confidence I'm sure they will be heard."

67648,BLACKFISH88,2007-05-04 01:35:00,191,Heard from my dad who is at Mt. Sinai (think thats how its spelled) and things are alright the baby has a strong heartbeat and they are going to try to hold the labour off for as long as they can. WOW the suspense is killing me!So hopefully all goes well godwilling and I'll have a brand new nephew Sunday or Monday and I'll dedicate this opener to the lil guy hopefully I can make him proud and catch a winner before I have to run to Mt Sinai. Pipe dreams LOL. and thanks to everyone for prayers and kind words. Now if I can get my wife to stop worrying.....and I'm sure prayers from home will be awesome dsn tyvm.
67649,irishfield,2007-05-04 01:43:00,26272,"Hopefully they can stop the labour all together. 3 months premature is way too soon. Leah started going into Labour almost 5 months pre with our youngest, that was being discounted as a miscarriage by the nurses. Darn smart miscarriage she is...just finished her first year at Carleton in Architecture. She went full term and the only difficulty was getting Leah into Labour when the time came.  Good luck to Andy and his lady."

One of my newphew's was 3 months early, and he's doing great, and smart as a whip.  They've come a long way since he was born over 20 yrs ago.  Please keep us updated..  Maureen"

67732,bpsbassman,2007-05-04 11:51:00,941,"Prayers on their way. My two Grandaughters were both born very, very early.  Miranda was 2Lb. 7 (nine years old now) and Maddy was 1 Lb. 14 (6 years now).  They are both perfectly fine, our little miracles.   They're just a little crazy from their Papa's genes It's a little scary (okay, very scary) when their born so soon and small, but it is absolutely amazing what the Hospital and Staff can do these days. Keep us posted."
67734,verno,2007-05-04 11:53:00,178,"How far are you folks travelling to be at Mt Sinai?  If you guys are travelling far and need a place to crash or just want a home cooked meal PM me, I'm not that far out of the city, we can arrange something."
