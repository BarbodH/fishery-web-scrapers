68013,John Bacon,2007-05-05 03:21:00,3277,Does anyone know where I can buy marine grade plywood in the eastern greater Toronto area?  I did see some CSP plywood at Home Depot.  Would that be marine grade plywood?
68021,NANUK,2007-05-05 04:33:00,797,"CSP stands for Canadian Softwood Plywood. it doesn't mean its marine grade plywood. The only place for marine grade plywood I know in GTA is north of  Q.E.W / east of Kipling Ave area, Noah's Marine 54-Six Point Rd Toronto PH:416-232-0522"

Real marine plywood is pretty expensive. It's what boat manufacturers use. Another place is Greenline Forest Products in Stouffville. If you want something cheaper, you can buy pressure treated plywood at Home Depot.  Hope this helps."

Price on the 3/4"" 4' X' 8 was $118, pretty much what I figured it was going to be, but you may as well do it right."
