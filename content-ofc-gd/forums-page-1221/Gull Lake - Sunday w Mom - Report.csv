This is our annual “week before Mother’s Day - Mother & Son” fishing trip.  Unfortunately she caught nothing, and I caught 1 sucker and 2 OOS Sm. Bass – No lakers.  Last year we did the same thing and produced fish.  We trolied, jigged, casted off weedy drop-offs, casted at rocky drop offs, casted around inflowing creeks/rivers, jigged here and there, etc.  I guess they have moved deep.  Water was 9 deg C.  Anyone catching Lakers in the Minden area?  Entropy"

Put in several hours but no serious fishing yet, just in the kayak and off the dock.  Last spring picked up for me after the May long weekend, the skitters were bad but the fish were biting."
