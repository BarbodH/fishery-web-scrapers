68300,Guest Johnny Bass,2007-05-06 14:51:00,0,Is there a how to post pics thread? I searched and couldn't find it and  is not accepted.
68302,snag,2007-05-06 14:55:00,1932,"Apparently, if you are topless there is screening mechanism that prevents certain pics to be uploaded.   Did you shrink the pic?"
68303,Guest Johnny Bass,2007-05-06 14:58:00,0,"I honestly was hoping to get a tan but it was too cold to take off the shirt!  My forehead is burnt though.  Shrink the pic? No, I am using myfishingpictures.com as a host. And am using the larger picture Urls.  Does not the IMG format work on this site?What is the other one. I cant remember."
68306,Roy,2007-05-06 15:05:00,13728,"It's all laid out here, Bud., thanks to Rick.http://www.ofncommunity.com/forums/index.php?showtopic=20"
68314,Guest Johnny Bass,2007-05-06 15:19:00,0,"Still doesn't work.... I guess I have to download the pics onto this site. Oh well, it took me 2 hours to write out my report. I guess I'll post it during the week when I have some more extra time."
68316,lew,2007-05-06 15:25:00,12767,"Hey Johnny B, I host my pics at photobucket.com then just copy & past the URL here along with my post and it's as easy as it can get."
68317,douG,2007-05-06 15:27:00,2693,"Some hosts use an object id that has = in the url.  Rick doesn't like that, as it permits the host to change the content.  I'm not sure of  the jargon, but I think that's the gist of it."
68322,irishfield,2007-05-06 15:41:00,26272,Dynamic  links as Doug points out get bounced. And yes Johnny the img tags still work.
68325,Guest Johnny Bass,2007-05-06 15:58:00,0,"Thanks Guys for the replies. Hey Lew, do you still have to put [/img]?"
68326,lew,2007-05-06 16:03:00,12767,"Nope, just copy & paste it JB, and it's all automatic.  When your pics are on Photobucket, you'll see the url just underneath it."
68328,irishfield,2007-05-06 16:04:00,26272,"I still put my pic properties between the img tags Johnny,"
68329,Guest Johnny Bass,2007-05-06 16:06:00,0,Thanks. I'll give it a quick shot before the guys come over for Poker!
68330,irishfield,2007-05-06 16:09:00,26272,There are actually multiple ways to load pictures now Johnny. Hosted somewhere and posted with the img tags. Hosted somewhere and posted with the insert image icon or you can also upload pictures directly from your computer using the upload feature. This one and I believe the image icon both give thumbnail pics in your post and people have to click on them to open it to full size. The -[/img]- tags with the property of the url in between give you the full picture in your post
68357,douG,2007-05-06 18:11:00,2693,"That  should just about cover it, Wayne.  A good refresher for me since I will have some pictures to post shortly."
68382,irishfield,2007-05-06 19:44:00,26272,I hope so Doug and hope you have a great time with your father! I'll have to dig up your report when I get back from up North. I'll be gone 14th to 25th.
