68414,Cast-Away,2007-05-06 22:35:00,790,I just got back from the Moon and had okay success. I went up there for Walleye and ended up with 3 Pike and no Walleye. The Walleye were still spawning up stream although we did have one follow up to the boat.  I suspect that the minnows that I was sold were too large at 3 to 4 inches in length.  The pike were in the 3 to 5 pound range and all caught in 9 feet of water with Repelas. There was also no wee growth on the flat that we were trolling over.

I don`t fish for walleye often anymore, but prefer minnows 4 to 6 inches long for them and have had them take bigger ones up north. They may have been more focused on spawning activities than feeding."
68561,irishfield,2007-05-07 03:54:00,26272,Nice outing Cast Away. Like Paul says...not an issue of minnow size.  ..and did anyone tell you we like pictures?
68605,Cast-Away,2007-05-07 12:31:00,790,"Sorry, I did not bother with pics because they were pike. My Brother-in-law had me take one of him and a fish only."
