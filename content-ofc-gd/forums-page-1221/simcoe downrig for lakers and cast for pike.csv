67892,glen,2007-05-04 19:55:00,2641,I have never fished the south end of simcoe.   Do people downrig for lakers in the spring or is it a waste of time?  How about casting for pike or is it no good?  any tips on where to try for pike?    thanks for any help.
67893,mattyk,2007-05-04 20:00:00,2110,"Cooks bay has a lot of pike. When i lived close to Lake Simcoe i would do really well fishing right after the season opened in early may. Try suspending jerk baits like the husky jerk or spinner baits close to the reeds, near the mouth of the holland river. The pike will be shallow."
