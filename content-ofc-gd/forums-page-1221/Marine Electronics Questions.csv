67882,SlowPoke,2007-05-04 19:27:00,2984," The one in my boat is like that but I think a little older... instead of ink and paper, mine has a chisel and tablet. -Brian"

68009,John Bacon,2007-05-05 02:54:00,3277,"What about BottomLine?  They make a good product as well.  The one that I purchased used in 1994 still works.  I have had to replace the power cord, but they shipped me a new one for free ... can't complain about that kind of service."
68018,SlowPoke,2007-05-05 04:24:00,2984,"I don't know if Bottomline will continue to exist. I can't find very many sources for them and none have what I am looking for. From the little reading I did, it appears they were bought out in Oct. 2005 and some models have been replaced by Humminbird units.  -Brian"
68130,bbog,2007-05-05 21:33:00,665,"I have a Lowrance unit and like it fine. It was a gift so I didn't have a say in which type (I would have looked closely at Garmin because of my GPS experience with them). The unit works fine, customer service is great in answering newbie questions. I am also not sponsored by Lowrance!!"
68305,Carp,2007-05-06 15:02:00,1488,"I have a Lowrance LMS300 GPS unit that I bought in the early 90's and still use it today. I'd buy another Lowrance unit if/when the time comes, but I'll still look at and compare other makes.  My VHF is a Raymarine mounted 25 watt unit.  No complaints, but I do want to replace the antenna. The one I wanted wasn't in stock and I settled for a cheaper unit.  I have 2 transom and 2 bow mount electrics, but nothing that would compare to todays high tech models."
67437,tonyb,2007-05-03 16:47:00,1637,"I think that's the problem.  Humminbird has a bad reputation from their 'Fish ID' model days.  They actually have some very nice crystal clear colour units now, regardless if they come with the 'Fish ID' feature or not, that should always be turned OFF.  Raymarine have some new digital sonars that are very crisp looking.  Lowrance is all about the 'clutter' and 'fuzz' in my opinion....     Humminbird Clarity - fuzz removal   Raymarine Digital - clarity    Tony"
67438,irishfield,2007-05-03 16:50:00,26272, It don't turn off on the Matrix series..new in 2004
67464,POLLIWOGG,2007-05-03 18:16:00,835,I started out with a marintech  maxim video and still use it. I would like to update into a sonar program that would run on a laptop but I can only find one and my old laptop won't run it so I'm going to have to study up and see whats out there. I had been checking out navman because of the fuel sensor.
67472,tonyb,2007-05-03 18:32:00,1637,"Ok...that does suck  are you sure though?...Aaron has the Matrix as well and he has always run it in pixel mode, not Fish ID.    I bought the 585c last year and have been very impressed for a mid-ranged sonar.  There was nothing to compare it to from the Lowrance product lineat the time...Still is nothing in that price range from Lowrance that compares...  I thought the FISH ID only sonars were limited to the very basic and cheap models...  Tony"
67474,Roy,2007-05-03 18:37:00,13728,"""I thought the FISH ID only sonars were limited to the very basic and cheap models...""  They are...Humminbird! :-)  Sorry Tony, it was stronger'n dirt."
67482,aplumma,2007-05-03 19:02:00,6896,"Tony the clutter that you see are the reflections from the bottom to the surface and then back again. Adjusting the gain clears the clutter and gives you a great picture of the bottom and  what the bottom is made of. The reason that other units are clearer is they have either less power on the signal or the electronics are necked down to the point that you are losing details that might help you find fish. It is very rare that I run my unit in the automatic modes because they are set up for multiple conditions and any of the units do none of them well. The lowrance is a quality unit that beat out all of the other units that I have had in the past including Hummingbird, bottom line, raymarine and garmin. What is the best for me may not be the best for someone else.  Art"
67678,POLLIWOGG,2007-05-04 04:32:00,835,"I heard a guy on the radio say he just passed through a school of bait fish, well I know this guy's boat and I know he runs the same sonar as I do and I know he's right behind me and I marked nothing. So I circle around and turn the gain up a hair and there they were but it wasn't bait, it was water flees.  Like Art says a little tuning can make a big difference,"
67721,SlowPoke,2007-05-04 11:14:00,2984,Thanks for the input folks. I was leaning towards an Eagle combo-unit but it seems the support for Lowrance is too overwhelming to consider anything else. Are they that good or does Lowrance sponser everybody on the forum but TonyB and myself? I'm going to do some reading and try to narrow it down amongst the Lowrance line up. I will likely post another thread with some questions. Thanks again gang. -Brian
67772,tonyb,2007-05-04 13:19:00,1637,"Just compare spec for spec when considering your purchase.  Some of the guys mentioned wattage and that is important for sure, but don't just buy a Lowrance 'because'... if you know what I mean  Lowrance has built a great reputation for themselves, but are not an industry leader when it comes to innovation or cutting edge technology.  The speed at which technology becomes obsolete these days is rediculous, you want to make a purchase that will satsify your needs for years to come.  P.S. Does anyone have an operational X-16 paper graph still in use or used paper rolls?  I always thought a cool substitute for a wallpaper border would be the scrolls of paper generated by the graph  Tony"
67783,Guest lundboy,2007-05-04 13:37:00,0,"Here's the way to solve the debate...  Buy two  Buy a Humminbird for the front of the boat, and a Lowrance for the console or vice versa.  That way you get the best of both worlds.  I have an old Humminbird Wide Vision at the front of the boat that I use because it's the only sonar they produced with true side pointing sonar (yes I can see fish in weeds on the left and right sides of the boat with the special transducer).  Don't confuse this with Side Imaging sonar.  I have a Lowrance 332c on the console which is on a RAM mount that I can swing around and view from the front deck as well.  The transducers are on separate frequencies and I rarely ever see any interference between them."
67830,Basskicker,2007-05-04 15:47:00,421,After reading all the EXCELLENT reviews concering the new Humminbird Side Imaging I purchased the 797c2Si....it's being installed right now.....hopefully get the boat out for a cruise tonight. I have to admit the service has been excellent wether on the phone or through emails.  Jason
67831,Fisherman,2007-05-04 15:54:00,7201,"That's a good one, just too many disgruntled people with hummincrows, and we all know where the crows hang out, around the garbage can."
67849,irishfield,2007-05-04 17:09:00,26272,"Maybe I should put this on my new boat Tony....  Brand new and in the boathouse at the lake. Found ""treasures"" lol  "
