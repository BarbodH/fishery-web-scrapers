68131,taper,2007-05-05 21:35:00,611,Those combo's will make great spares for when friends come out. Thanks for the heads up Irishfield.
68147,Dutch,2007-05-05 22:11:00,831,Bought the green Abu combo last year at 50% off and bought this black one at the 60% off today.  Great combo for the price.  Worth every penny.  Great jigging rods and enough backbone to fish the bass too.
68151,bbog,2007-05-05 22:25:00,665,The last two years I have bought the Abu combo as a back-up rod. SUPER deal at $30 bucks and has brought in some decent fish.
68152,silveradosheriff,2007-05-05 22:27:00,1025, That oughta do the trick!
68155,irishfield,2007-05-05 22:34:00,26272, Not as good as the 10 million for flash light tag on the water at lakair...but it'll do !
68161,silveradosheriff,2007-05-05 22:49:00,1025,
68193,express168,2007-05-06 00:56:00,327,"I bought one of the Abu combos last year and loved it. But as a result of my own stupidity I broke it. They refunded me for it , but didn't have any left and said that they couldn't raincheck it. Well it looks like I will have to go in tomorrow and get a new one. Thanks for the heads up Irish."
68194,glen,2007-05-06 01:01:00,2641,I like shimano but the green abu's are nice.  My record is a 10 channel cat in current on that combo.  Go get one.
68249,ccmtcanada,2007-05-06 04:09:00,7971,Wayne...thanks for the plug for Canadian Tire....LOL.  I work at corp head office....we can use the sales.....
68319,irishfield,2007-05-06 15:31:00,26272,"LOL Cliff, My wife's god father was Chairman of the Board and owns a store or 2 in Calgary...gotta keep Steve in golf balls to slice into the water hazards behind his house."

68396,ccmtcanada,2007-05-06 21:15:00,7971, Hmmm...a few stores in the Calgary area?? Wouldn't be the Dand family would it?
68397,irishfield,2007-05-06 21:18:00,26272,"Groch ...it's Steve's ""retirement"" store. He use to own the biggest CTC in Canada.  He's the fella I learned the phrase ""the harder I work the luckier I get"" from. He started with the change in his pocket and a dream, many years ago.  Rough when they have to go to Hawaii or the Bahamas for Corp meetings though...."
68406,ccmtcanada,2007-05-06 21:52:00,7971," I know the family...in fact, I believe that I worked with one of the Groch's wife...she used to be at home office before moving out there...her name is Daria....small world!"
68432,irishfield,2007-05-06 23:40:00,26272,Daria is Steve's Daughter. We attended her wedding in Calgary about a dozen years back.
68434,ccmtcanada,2007-05-06 23:46:00,7971, Wow...that long ago?  Man...seems like yesterday when Daria and I were just lowly analysts at the big home office....LOL.
68437,irishfield,2007-05-06 23:52:00,26272,She wasn't living out there Cliff...just came home so Dad could throw a big wedding at the CN/CP hotel at 1 front street in Calgary. Then she returned to TO to work at Hdq. Probably kept her last name... Not sure where she is now...if you want to have a rondavou(sp) I could set it up pdq.. LOL Leah stays in pretty good contact with her God Parents.
