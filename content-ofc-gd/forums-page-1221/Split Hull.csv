66328,Bernie,2007-05-01 01:00:00,3190,"Moosehead, Wayne is right. I'm afraid you are going to have to bite the bullet on this repair. No quick and easy fix. No goop or glue or quikkie aluminum on this one. If not repaired properly you will never be able to trust it again."
66331,irishfield,2007-05-01 01:04:00,26272,Well I don't know how much false advertising there is on that website...but I can 110% guarantee it's NEVER been used on that 747 that they picture!

66353,bpsbassman,2007-05-01 01:44:00,941,"Ken, I would tear the floor out and check and see if there has been any patch job like GCD suggested. If there is then I would be going after the previous owner (in small claims court if necessary).  Take lots of pictures. If there is not, then I would be doing anything Wayne suggests.  He did an amazing job on mine and knows what he's talking about."
66360,sonny,2007-05-01 01:56:00,511,"ok moosehead,,,i gots an answer for ya,,,,we use this two part epoxy to fix the strut mounts on a certain type of van(no need to mention),,,anyway this stuff is amazing and i am sure it will fix your boat,,,this stuff dry's harder then steel...i don't recall the name right now but call tomorrow to find out,,pm me if ya want to know"
66420,aplumma,2007-05-01 11:06:00,6896,You can expose the inside of the area and drill a small hole at both ends of the crack and  have it welded inside and out. Then have a stress plate welded 2 inches larger than the crack on the inside of the boat. Their is no molecular bond between any of the goops and creams that you buy they will fail from the movment of the hull as it flexs from the water pounding and the cooling and heating from the sun and water. A marina is the best place to start or someone who builds metal for a living. If their was not any goop on it to start with then their is just as good a chance the previous owner did not know about the crack. Their is no point in head hunting after all it was sold as a used boat with all of the high and low points that go with the used price.   Art
66423,Roy,2007-05-01 11:13:00,13728,"I know nothing  about repairs to aluminum hulls but IMHO, that is not a stress crack. That's been hit. Either way, have it repaired properly. Don't mess with it."
67610,moosehead,2007-05-04 00:45:00,90,Well thanks for all the input guys.  After having a couple days to think about this i think i am either going to sell this boat as is and let someone else repair it or get it repaired then sell it. Either way i want to get rid of this boat.  Part of what is making me think this way is i have found a great deal on a brand new Lund.
68251,scfwong,2007-05-06 04:15:00,1,"Try the weld shop besides Pisces Marine in Oakville. 669 Third Line, Oakville, Ontario 905-827-4384 You can ask for John at Pisces, he will direct you to the weld shop beside him.  Sorry, I can't remember the name of the weld shop, but they specialist in boat welding repair. They maybe able to help you.  Good Luck. Sunny"
68356,Tybo,2007-05-06 18:03:00,1373,"Two ways of fixing that hole.  The easy way, Fill it with a type of epoxy and flog it.  The hard way. That can not be welded. It is to close to the seem. welding will burn out the sealant that is put between the seams, that prevents it from leaking.  With aluminum being a non ferris metal, it shrinks with heat. Pulling on rivet holes and shrinking rivets. Being to close to the ribbing, You could and will warp thees do to heat.  To repair this boat,It needs a formed patch. Which means you have to be excisable to a metal brake."
68376,irishfield,2007-05-06 19:27:00,26272,Thanks for confirming my thoughts Paul...was starting to think I was dreaming incorrect aluminum repair methods.
68387,Tybo,2007-05-06 19:55:00,1373,"Wayne, Hope thats not senility kicking in?"
68388,irishfield,2007-05-06 20:01:00,26272,"That happened long ago Paul! Like I said to Terry on Friday night when he walked into the shop...""what the hell do I know about aluminum and rivets""...."
68390,Tybo,2007-05-06 20:20:00,1373,"You notice that in the picture, that the hull plate is either to big or it was rolled to hard and they stretch it.  The rivets on the hull bend look pretty sunk in."
68392,irishfield,2007-05-06 20:47:00,26272,"Very poor consistancy on rivet hole locations and the forming for sure.  If I built stuff that floats and pounded thru waves at 80+ MPH, I wouldn't be bending the edges over to rivet...I'd be using extruded angle, that has no stress built into it from forming, for the corners. Oh wait...I do that already...  "
68417,Gerritt,2007-05-06 22:52:00,6129,"All I can say on this subject is this.....   If you sell it Sell it to someone that can do the repair properly... you have already been told how it can be achieved. If you half ass it you could be putting an entire family at risk.... do the smart thing, either sell it for scrap or get it fixed properly and sell it.   Do the right thing as I am sure you dont want a needless drowning on your conscience.   Gerritt."
66305,glen,2007-04-30 23:38:00,2641,But why did it crack?????  What is putting stress on that area??????  If you repair the crack it may just crack in a new spot like it already has.  Must be some cheap crap aluminum to do that.  Sorry but that is a mess.
66313,Greencoachdog,2007-05-01 00:07:00,8163,"Can you say Titanic??? If I was going to have a nightmare about a crack in the hull of my boat, it would be one like that! I agree with Wayne, your hull was cracked when you bought it. If you'll open it up on the inside, I'm sure you'll find some kind of half-ass quick-fix job... probably silicone caulk or some such crap. You need professional help with this one."
66315,glen,2007-05-01 00:12:00,2641,The Titanic got a hole because of ice.  This boat looks like it didn't hit anything.
66317,irishfield,2007-05-01 00:17:00,26272,"Look at the original crack...it HIT something, or wore thru while tied up rubbing a rock or damaged dock. The new crack above it is fatigue.... from the original cracked spot not doing it's job of forming the angle/adding stength to the hull. Was the old crack evident when you bought the boat Moosehead?  Suggestions of JB Weld, or any other paste/glue/hocas pocas are not going to cut it. Fix it right...or not at all. You and your family/friends lives could depend on that repair."
66322,Greencoachdog,2007-05-01 00:40:00,8163," The Titanic sank because of a gash on it's side, not too much different than this one.  Any name brand boat should be able to withstand a light chop or a heavy chop!!! This boat was damaged before it started leaking this time... I'll bet any amount of money that the ""light chop"" just broke the seal on the half-ass fix job that was used to sell the boat."
66326,moosehead,2007-05-01 00:50:00,90,"I do not know what caused the crack, had it out on Sunday in a 2 foot chop but surely the boat is capable of handling that and more. There is a slight possibility that the lower crack was there when i bought it, I noticed it after my first outing and tried to fix it with a cold weld epoxy. The larger crack in the splash rail opened up on Sunday. Would a product like this work?"
