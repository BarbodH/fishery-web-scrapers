68472,huntervasili,2007-05-07 00:49:00,1604,Well I decided to hit ***EDIT (a creek nearby my home in burlington today (and yesterday too) and had a little bit of luck. Saw probably 20+ with the polarized... But I did manage to catch a nice steelie.  The water was really low and gin clear the whole time cause its been a while since it rained. Heres the little guy...  and once more   Unfortunately I forgot the OFNcommunity.com paper at home and I hadn't a pen or anything to write on my arm...or the fish   Edited out the name of the creek due to an anonomous request... if you are interested PM me... I am more than happy to help out!
