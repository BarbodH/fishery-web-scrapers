All the great fishing reports start coming in and we get some great pictures from some talented OFC photographers.  I have not got the smoker craft in the lake this year yet, but you guys are making me really ichy.  Thanks to all who have got me fired up this year already and I look forward to the reports that are to come.  Rich if you are out there somewhere on the information super highway we call the internet, I can't wait for some new shows."
