67594,Rizzo,2007-05-03 23:52:00,4754,I don't think its ridiculous.  Sounds like stealing to me.  Guess white collar crime isn't deserving of jail time either?
67731,blaque,2007-05-04 11:51:00,2419,"let me reword that.......that amount of jailtime, is a little much. I agree, community service, something positive after a short jaunt in the pokey."
67786,darsky,2007-05-04 13:43:00,586,how about the guy who won first place-he must feel good about winning the right way.
67789,Roy,2007-05-04 13:46:00,13728,Nah...he just feels good about not having been caught. :-)
67793,Guest gbfisher,2007-05-04 13:53:00,0,You'd be suprised how many celebrities have been CAUGHT CHEATING and are still in the tournaments.  
67797,shawnf,2007-05-04 13:57:00,46,"Wow... people never cease to amaze me....  First off, I think we can all agree that cheating in a tourny is just lame. Come on, you have the right to go out into gods country and do something that you LOVE doing, but then throw it all away for something as common as money. Stupid.  I was wondering tho - This jail time that he might serve, is this the punishment for having these fish on stringers or is this punishment for cheating at a tourny?  I know some communities take their fishing to the extreme, but I sort of disagree with any kind of legal punishment for cheating. I'm sure some will disagree with me, but lets face it... A tourny is a business operation and cheating in a fishing tournament doesn't necessarily infringe on peoples rights, safety, or well being.  Thoughts??"
67802,danbo,2007-05-04 14:07:00,2646,Let he who hath not sinned..cast the first lure!
67803,misfish,2007-05-04 14:10:00,29133," To me it,s FRAUD,like you said,it,s a business operation,which means penalty by law, jail time or what ever, is what he will recieve.  Im sure it,s in the back of some anglers minds if someone is cheating. Hard to cover the whole area and know whats going on.The sport is what it is called,a sport.Saddly there are poor sports out there."
67812,shawnf,2007-05-04 14:47:00,46," Fraud.... You hit the nail on the head there. I'm just saying that technically, the business owner/operator is still going to pay out the same amount of money no matter who happens to win. So the only people that REALLY get cheated are the other contestants, which of course, know that there is no guarantee that they will win anyways... just like gambling.  Now, if the rules of the tourny were set up so that you had to have at least a certain amount of fish (in pounds or whatever) to win money, and the business people would only pay those who come up with that weight and more, AND everyone that met that weight requirement would get paid, then yes.... that would in fact be a direct fraudulent act. The person would be cheating the business owner out of cash.  I definitely don't condone in what this guy did, just seeing if people here would look at it from another angle."
67904,bigbuck,2007-05-04 20:27:00,2449,This joker should get the maximum fine + a whole whack of community service (cleaning sewers sounds right). I agree with Pigeon regarding the generalizations in society today wholeheartedly.
67908,lew,2007-05-04 20:38:00,12767,"Well, the way I look at it, forget about the fishing aspect of this thing and treat the guy just as he should be...a THIEF and nothing less.  What he did was no less than some punk sneaking into your home and stealing money from you. He knew what he was doing and his whole intent was to rip off the guys who were trying to win the money fair & square.  Throw his azz in jail and toss the key just like they should do with any other thief.  Oh yeah, and ban him permanentely from ever fishing with honest folks again too."
67937,Tarzan's Jane,2007-05-04 22:55:00,1183,"Having worked in the criminal justice system....no jail time is ever given to first time offenders on a summary conviction (theft under $1,000)...the system has been moving more towards community service and away from incarceration.  I agree that he should do some type of restitution/community service...but jail time....not at all."
67941,misfish,2007-05-04 23:13:00,29133," Well I still feel it is FRAUD,I know too well that first timers get away with what ever they do,sorta. SHAME AND EXPOSURE OF THIER NAMES I guess it,s enough to SHAME thier name. The guy that cheats will be rememebered more then the guy that won.  Story,remember that tourney that Bob won in 2007...................................Nope ..................remember that guy that got cheating,what a goof......................."
68051,charlesn,2007-05-05 12:41:00,551,"I think the reason they waited until he accepted the prizes was that no crime had been committed until then that was worthy of legal prosecution.  As much as I'd love to see him receive vigilante justice, I guess in the eyes of the law it was just $800.  To me it's more than the money because it gives yet another black eye to tournament anglers.  It's a big part of the reason I believe that Pro/Am tournaments are the way to go.  Awful lot harder fetch fish from a cage with a stranger in the boat, especially when that stranger is randomly drawn and could be a RCMP officer, MNR employee or whatever.  Charles"
68091,Mark Kulik,2007-05-05 16:17:00,348,"I agree with Charles, guys who cheat in tournaments should be treated like any other thief, I think of the hard work and dedication it takes to succeed in competitive fishing, anyone who cheats is slapping every honest angler in the face!"
68102,daisy_girl58,2007-05-05 17:53:00,116,In Missouri....I know what they would do to him....He is fortunate to be caught up here!  Lorissa
68148,bbog,2007-05-05 22:24:00,665,"This guy got caugh cheating in a fishing tournament - SO WHAT - Right? He only got CAUGHT cheating in a fishing tournament - but what else has his reduced moral fibre allowed him to do and get away with?  We often take a sympathetic view of first timers - but should this be first time cheater or long time cheater, first time caught?? Something to think about when trying to determine the appropriate punishment."
68186,lunkerbasshunter,2007-05-06 00:21:00,2585,7 years for 800 hundred bucks...........BURN haha hope he gets full term!
68206,Tarzan's Jane,2007-05-06 01:19:00,1183,"Okay....I think I am understanding the honour in fishing...if indeed this person (I was going to say gentleman, but thought better of it) has done this before...either with fishing or just in everyday life...is 7 years enough? - or should we go back to the dark ages and just waste him.  Don't mean to get off topic but our justice system puts more value on $$$ than human life.  If this person or any other person (including females), abuses a child in the worse way...I think you know what I mean...the justice system does not have a penalty as strick - these very sick people are out again in no time re-offending.  The scales of justice do tip.  I know...I said it was off topic...ya, he cheated - no honour in that, and no life long damage done to anyone either."
67132,darsky,2007-05-02 20:23:00,586,"A Missouri angler is in hot water for allegedly cheating during a fishing tournament last Sunday. Acting on a tip, officers and agents of the Water Patrol and Conservation Department searched a duck blind and found two stringers with a bass on each one. The agents tagged the fish and then set up surveillance near the blind. On Sunday, during the tournament, angler Gary Jones allegedly arrived at the blind, retrieved the fish and put them in his livewell. Unfortunately for him, state agents were filming and caught Jones in the act. At the weigh-in, Jones had enough weight to finish in second place and he also had the third biggest bass of the tournament. All together, Jones won over $800 dollars in cash and prizes. As he left the stage however, Water Patrol officers arrested him. Authorities say Jones faces two to seven years behind bars if convicted."
67141,huntervasili,2007-05-02 20:52:00,1604,you get what you deserve... cheaters should be punished! plus it ruins the sport for everyone else
67145,Terry,2007-05-02 21:02:00,14456,hey Who never thought this would happen any time there is big money prizes you can count on someone trying to find a way to rip them off  I saw it a few times when I was doing tourneys.....guys put fish in a cage..they got caught    there was a guy with a 6lb small mouth and was trying to sell it to all the tourney guys for 100 bucks I said let me check it out...I grabbed it and through in back in the lake..was that guy ticked at me....oh well you roll the dice you pay the price
67148,Rich Clemens,2007-05-02 21:16:00,3131,Good for him.  Too bad they did not arrest him right in front of everyone as they weighed his fish.
67151,easton13th,2007-05-02 21:22:00,371,"I hope he get his just reward! Not just a slap on the wrist. There should be an example made, he is fishing in a tournament. What better way to spread the word about a cheater.  Easton"
67159,bigbuck,2007-05-02 21:42:00,2449,"C H E A T E R S  N E V E R  P R O S P E R ! ! ! !  You know, it makes me sick to hear of this sort of stuff. I hope that this guy gets the book thrown at him and if and when he gets out of jail, he is finished with tournament angling!!! Whoever his sponsors were should definitely distance themselves from him.  MORON!!"
67166,silveradosheriff,2007-05-02 21:56:00,1025,Seven years for $800 - looks good on him!
67170,BabyHerc,2007-05-02 22:02:00,285,My friends and I have seen this happen on our lakes.  Yet another reason why I'm not a tournament fan.
67259,Rizzo,2007-05-03 02:13:00,4754," hahaha good for you Terry!  Last spring I was fishing L. Muskoka the same day as the big pike tourney they have.  My buddy caught a pike over 30 inches which likely most of the anglers could have used (we were not entered in the tourney).  We joked about selling it, then released it right in front of some guys."
67269,brandon,2007-05-03 02:40:00,857,"i dont want to start an argument here but some of you guys seem to be classifying all tournament fishermen as ""idiots""....its like somebody commits a murder.......does that make everybody else a murderer?"

67285,GbayGiant,2007-05-03 03:39:00,1780,"I think time in jail is a little severe over $800 or any monetary scams (not all but most), public humiliation would be a better solution if he has any conscience he would be ashamed of himself for years to come.  Put his picture in local newspapers, websites etc... and let it be known he has no morals and that would be a bigger punishment just letting him walk around town getting shunned upon. The tax payers don't need to pack the jails with these type of people, that would be just like giving him another $40000 each year to sit in jail. Maybe 5000 hours of public service would be a good solution, make him do work on the same water he cheated on."
67286,brandon,2007-05-03 03:40:00,857,"sure its a stretch......that's not the point though....i'm just saying that since there are a few cheaters out there, it doesn't mean that all tournament anglers are."
67290,JerseyDog,2007-05-03 03:57:00,190,"Two years in jail is asinine. Maybe a month. Maybe a week. Enough to shame him into never doing anything stupid like that again.  Two years in jail means he loses his job, maybe his house, his family suffers. A little excessive for an $800 scam."

67310,mrdylan,2007-05-03 09:40:00,111,  Most employers will let you go anyways it is even written in my contract at work and the fact that it's in the media is not helping either. He will also have a tough time finding a job with a record as well as most employers check your record more so than your references. I am close to the managers where I work and from what they told me this happens quite a bit. Cheating/stealing are key things they look for too.  This is unfortunate really some people.
67316,OhioFisherman,2007-05-03 10:33:00,6623,"They caught a couple guys here cheating( they had fish planted in a fish bag) some years ago, one of the other people in th tourney found the bag and marked the fish, clipped a fin and told the tournie director. At the weigh in the dudes had the fish,er they lived on the lake. They haven`t been in a tournie since, some sell their respect cheap."
67319,pigeonfisher,2007-05-03 11:01:00,696,"  ALL Salesman are cheats and liars ALL Politicians have no morals and are cheats and liars ALL Managers are out to screw you ALL Union Members are lazy no-gooders EVERYONE on welfare is cheating the system ALL moderators on the interweb are the best people in the world and are always fair and reasonable!! ALL teachers are lazy and should never complain about working to much EVERYONE from the Middle East is a terrorist ALL Tourny Anglers are pompous hotshots that ruin the lakes  Get the point?  Generalizations rule the world, Brandon.  Go out and do something positive to prove them wrong.  Be your Best, don't let yourself get pigeonholed and be ready to explain the benefits of what you do.

67396,kennyman,2007-05-03 14:02:00,737,"Looks good on him that he got caught, but two years in jail is definetely retarded. Maybe 30 days and a $5000 fine. Along with the fact that he should never be allowed in a tournament again the guy has to live this absolute humiliation for the rest of his life. I know everyone is following the ""Baretta"" wisdom here LOL. ""Don't do the crime if you can't do the time. Don't do it!"".  BUT, what happened to the punushment should fit the crime? I like the community service work. Maybe he should clean up that shoreline every Saturday for the next year (plus a big fine... hit him where it hurts... the pocketbook)?"
67401,Steelcat,2007-05-03 14:31:00,191,"I agreed with you kennyman.  I actually think get him jail a short period of time (a taste behind bars), then a huge fine (into conservation), plus community work.  Jailing him for 2 years is a waste of tax payer's money.   For sure he'll never have any sponsor ever."
