68698,zman,2007-05-07 15:49:00,179,Well I headed up to the cottage on Saturday Morning to take the boat up  left Guelph at 5:00am and got to the cottage at 9:45am Nice drive not allot of people Lunched the boat at the public launch about 2min from the cottage Right in the town of Lavigne Well after a little while we got the boat going and decided to go for a ride to take a look at the lake This was my first time on lake nipissing I have alway fished the french river most of my summer holidays Well boy is it a shallow lake on the west side I was out for about 4 hours touring around trying to get to know the water and the average depth was about 6' I didn't venture to far  little bit at a time. I can't see the walley being to good later in the year but I will have to wait and see Does anyone know if this side of nippising is on GPS
