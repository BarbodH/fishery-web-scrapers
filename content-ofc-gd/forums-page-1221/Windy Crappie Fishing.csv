68128,Steelcat,2007-05-05 21:22:00,191,"Arrived at the Rice Lake at around 6:20 in the morning.  We could already feel the light breeze.  We head to our usual spot just around Bewdley and started to drift around.  We managed to find an area where we could catch several fish per 10 minutes.  After an hour of fishing, we already caught 20+ then the wind started to pick up.   At that spot we were also able to catch a bullhead, some perch, sunfish, rockbass, and one finger size largemouth.  At 10am, people started to crowd around us, once again boat crossing just 20 feet beside us while we were fishing.  As we were fishing, we saw a boat driving from one boat to another, and we immediate realized what's going on.  It's the rarely seen MNR Officer checking for fishing liciences as well as for out of season fish (big thumbs up for the officer).  After 30 minutes, we decided to head to another spot further to the east.  Before we arrived at the 2nd spot, we saw at least 12 boats crowding over a spot.  After seeing that, we drove further east away from the crowd.  The wind and the waves constantly growing stronger, so drifting will be out of the question.  Even with the anchor down, our boat slowly drifted (good for us because we can cover more water).  We once again hit a good spot where we had several double header.  Overall we caught more than 80 Crappies from 8 inches to 12 inches.  Consider the wind and waves, I say it's a pretty good day All fish were located at 8 feet of water, and caught 4 feet below the float. Now my eyes are focusing onto the Walleye open next saturday. One of the Rockbass  Bullhead that fought like after drinking Redbull ><  A 8 inches perch  The largest Crappie caught today "
