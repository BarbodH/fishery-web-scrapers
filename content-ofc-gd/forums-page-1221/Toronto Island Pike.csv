68224,motv8tr,2007-05-06 02:03:00,2587,"Nice!!!, any idea how big she was?  Maureen"
68232,wingman,2007-05-06 02:24:00,16,"thanks guys, TBAY, we bumped into you on the island when you got hooked. Glad to hear that everything went well at the hospital. Motv8er, our guess is about 36-38 inches but she was fat! , stupid me the lipgrip had a tape measure but I forgot all about it when we were handling the fish."
68235,urbanangler1990,2007-05-06 02:28:00,933,"nice, what was lure of choice, if u mind me asking"
68237,tbayboy,2007-05-06 02:47:00,1497,"Holy crap your right wigman, sorry about not recognizing you right off (kinda distracted at the time hehe).  Congrats again."
68246,Pigeontroller,2007-05-06 04:04:00,2793,"Nice fish, congrats. Holding a fish that size vertically isn't recomended though."
68248,dodger1414,2007-05-06 04:06:00,44,congrats on the PB
68255,silveradosheriff,2007-05-06 11:29:00,1025,"Nice one, but I have to second Dax's comment."
68304,snag,2007-05-06 14:59:00,1932,"Great catch,  I learned quickly to change the hold too. I was also reminded to obscure the background of the photo to preserve the spot for future fishing.  Sure is a beauty, congrats!"
68312,Jigger,2007-05-06 15:15:00,1237,"Nice fish, wingman. Congrats on the PB!"
68331,mepps,2007-05-06 16:23:00,1301,nice job!
68336,Victor,2007-05-06 16:27:00,1609,"nice fish, it was crazy when i caught my first TO pike too... never handled such a big fish before and altho i didn't do the vertical hold, mine wasn't much better lol ...  Great job!"
68337,majorlifts,2007-05-06 16:31:00,171,"Dont worry about backgrounds, every one knows about To Island pike, Dead horse. further in where the first main bridge is to the island you will find the pike get bigger. Ehg and I have caught pike 42"". Although we were in a boat, and casting like mad men. Plenty of double headers and plenty o fish to go round there was. Nice job, Key ingredient, move around."
68348,Roy,2007-05-06 17:07:00,13728,Good job....thanks for the report.
68359,wingman,2007-05-06 18:37:00,16,"Thanks guys. Urbanangler, I was using a 3/4 ounce booyah moontalker."
68370,douG,2007-05-06 19:02:00,2693,You're just making that stuff up.  Everyone knows they only work at night.
68371,Rich Clemens,2007-05-06 19:06:00,3131,That's one nice pike in anyone's book.  Congrats on your PB.  Keep going and you'll do it again.
68409,wingman,2007-05-06 21:59:00,16,"Hey Doug, you're probably right. The thing is, the dark blade came off that day while I was casting. Had to use a silver blade off another spinnerbait and that did the trick."
