68366,motv8tr,2007-05-06 18:52:00,2587,"Thanks guys, she's an Akbash, which is a Turkish flock gaurdian dog.  She spent the first three years being bred and tied up outside, and she is very hand shy so I assume she was also physically abused.  She's never been inside a house and is very nervous on floors.  I have to picik up a couple of runners for her so she can get into the kitchen and out the back door.  I also have to do some work on my fence to make sure she doesn't get out.  I am picking her up on tuesday from the New Market OSPCA.  It's going to be a lot of work to gain her trust, but from what I've seen when I have spent time with her, she has great potential and will be a real sweet heart once she comes into her own and feels comfortable, but I do expect that will take a bit of time.  I just wish I could have 5 dogs and had an unlimited supply of money, they have two 9 yr old dogs that must go together, their owner is now to old to properly care for them, a couple of real sweeties too...oh well, one day I'll have my farm, get my kennl lisence and bring them all home  Maureen  Maureen"
68372,setomonkey,2007-05-06 19:08:00,872,"Maureen,  It's awesome that you can give that dog a caring and loving home, our dog also came from a rescue and it's hard to imagine life without him around.  Mike"
68385,irishfield,2007-05-06 19:47:00,26272,You've got a great heart gal...but you know you could go   more often if you cut down on the zoo population eh?
68391,motv8tr,2007-05-06 20:20:00,2587,"Wrong Wayne, these guys don't keep me from fishing, I just can't be gone all day is all.  No, what I need is a fishing partner, or partners closer to home who can put up with a girly fisher     Oh, and they need to be able to fish weekdays...I don't ask for much do I  Maureen"
68429,DebS,2007-05-06 23:31:00,56,"Hi Maureen, She's a real beauty - just look at all the love in her eyes. I'm sure that before too long, she'll seem like she was always part of the family. She's a sweet looking little thing and I'm sure she'll be a great companion. Good for you for saving her! Deb"
