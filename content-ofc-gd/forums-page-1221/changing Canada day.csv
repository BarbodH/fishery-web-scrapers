68327,holdfast,2007-05-06 16:04:00,1813,"Terry, Although I'm totally against changing the Idea of Canada day I do love your initiative.  I got to thinking though.  It is kinda related to fishing and the outdoors.  Its the gas gouging that really makes my stomach turn.  Our prices just jumped to a 1.13.  Fantastic marketing scheme because my feeling is it will jump again for sure once and maybe twice before I and most others start the fishing season for the long weekend.  I would sign a petition, I would boycott any gas station at least a week at atime where it really hurts.  Start with one that will likely start a gas war.  OFC might have a lot of clout, maybe newsworthy.  As far as myself, I would try to follow through on the Saskatchewan side.  I know some readers will say it wont work, but we have a minority government that wont listen to the consumers.  YET.  Somethings got to be done.  Why not put the effort where we are being blatantly cheated."
67601,Terry,2007-05-04 00:14:00,14456,"dates are for historians events are for people....when it falls on a tues. through thrus. I don't do anything to celebrate it but I do when it falls on a long weekend.............. but no problem..note fisherman, not invited to canada day BBQ"
67608,Fisherman,2007-05-04 00:38:00,7201,"That's okay, I'm working days, fri/sat/sun, peace and quite."
67614,irishfield,2007-05-04 00:50:00,26272,Just don't park in Terry's laneway to watch the fireworks !  I'll be thinkin of you Terry...while I fish and lie back in the boat watching the Temagami Fireworks display again this year.  BTW...why we worrying about this...this year it's on Sunday!
67616,pikehunter,2007-05-04 00:54:00,1659," Yeah I know the ""u"" in certain words really is redundant. It makes sense to drop it as it pretty much silent anyhow. It's just one of those things with me, to make sure that those who drop the U know there is another way to spell it.  Something like the time I walked into a butcher shop in a town somewhere near Corning NY one day and pointed out to the shop keeper that they had something for sale that is not available in Canada... ""Canadian Bacon""  She did not see the houmour (there's that U again"") in my comment.  Maybe we can slip that ""U"" into Canada Day somehow Eh?"
67618,Terry,2007-05-04 00:57:00,14456,"yeah... I was just seeing if people thought it was a good idea I was with a group of about 25 people and someone asked if they were doing anything for Cananda day rhis year and right away some said well if it falls on a weekend this year we will be doing lots and that was the general consensuses , that people really only celebrated it when it fell on weekends..I thought celebrating it was a good thing  oh well party on  Garth yeah party on ........"
67621,irishfield,2007-05-04 01:00:00,26272,Yep Wayne's World...LOL
67624,Terry,2007-05-04 01:04:00,14456,you caught that.... huh  LOL
67780,OhioFisherman,2007-05-04 13:33:00,6623,"LOL PikeHunter, you don`t have Canadian bacon? That is un-natural, we even have American fries! LOL  Every holiday should be a 4 day weekend!"
67785,tonyb,2007-05-04 13:43:00,1637,"I agree Terry, party on!  What ever happened to the Labatt Blue petition a couple years ago that was calling for a long weekend in June!?  Tony"
67788,lew,2007-05-04 13:45:00,12767,"I'm with you all the way on this one Terry, and have thought the same thing for years, it's absolutely moronic to have 1 day off in the middle of the week, then go back to work for a day or 2, then off for the weekend again. Doesn't give you enuff time to do anything at all with the day.  I always figured the 1st Monday of July would be good for the holiday though, that way everyone could enjoy the long weekend, then only have to put in a 4 day week and then off for a couple more.  Just show me where to sign"
67874,mattyk,2007-05-04 18:31:00,2110,I like the idea!
