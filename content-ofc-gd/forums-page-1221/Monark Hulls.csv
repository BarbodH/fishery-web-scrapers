68633,John,2007-05-07 13:59:00,2956,Anyone have any knowledge of or experience with Monark hulls? I believe they are part of Starcraft or vice-versa.  John..
68639,taper,2007-05-07 14:08:00,611,I thought they made hulls for a bunch of boat manufacturers. I though they made some for Legend but not sure.
