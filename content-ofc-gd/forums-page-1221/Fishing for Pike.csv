I was wondering if anyone might suggest other places to go that are good for pike. I'm just north of Toronto, by the way. Not sure if Lake Simcoe or Georgian Bay areas are good for pike or walleye.  I'm really eager to give this a shot. I didn't hit the islands this weekend but will most likely give it a shot this week unless I can find somewhere else to go.  Any help would be greatly appreciated!  Thanks!"
