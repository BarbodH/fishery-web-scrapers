68180,lovetofish,2007-05-06 00:03:00,500,what i would do for a day of fishing like that!!!  Right now i can only dream.
67751,solopaddler,2007-05-04 12:18:00,8605,"Well, originally I had plans to fish for Pike on Georgian Bay this week. Unfortunately those plans fell through, so myself and 2 other friends decided to fish for steelhead. Personally, at this time of year I'm getting a little bored with steelhead fishing, as there's so many other great things to do once May rolls around. So this was my steelheading swansong 'till October rolls around......and a good one it was  . It was a huge numbers day with easily 150 fish put on the bank between the 3 of us  . All the fish were dropbacks, but fully recovered and full of fight with most fish clearing the water 5-6 times.....                               Obviously, the pic's are just a fraction of what we actually caught. Hot bait was whatever you happened to have on your hook  . Seriously, they were ravenous and hitting everything. Water temps. were still a reasonable 60 degrees, so the fish were all still in good shape when released. Definitely ended the steelhead season with a bang!  cheers,  Mike"
