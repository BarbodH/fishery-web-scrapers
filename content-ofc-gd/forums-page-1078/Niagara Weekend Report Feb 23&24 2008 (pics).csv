At times floating ice chunks were heavy, but didn’t affect boat control or the fishing.   Anglers from shore seemed to be doing pretty good! I helped land a 12.2lb buck steelhead while putting my boat in the water on Sat. The Steelhead was hooked on one of Cliffs custom tied streamers! That was the biggest steelhead I’ve seen in 2008. We didn’t go above the dams, all fish were caught on the Canadian side of the River.   Small hot pink, loose rainbow bags were the hot ticket both Saturday & Sunday. We did hit a few fish on Live Minnows, and one on a blue/silver Kwick fish.   Our biggest Steelhead weighted just under 12lbs on the scale.   Check out the teeth marks on this lucky ( not to have been eaten) little Brown trout!   Great weekend on the Lower Niagara!  See you on the River,  Paul Castellano Cast Adventures"
164387,ShaunB,2008-02-25 22:11:00,73,hmmmm...would that be from a musky?  I guess the ice boom hasn't started yet....or the upper is not breaking up at all

164925,mattyk,2008-02-27 03:25:00,2110,"some nice looking fish, that looks like one nasty attack from a musky."
164939,Gawel,2008-02-27 03:51:00,27,"Good stuff.  Having toned my fishing down over the winter, for me its been since December that I was able to fish the Niagara with good clarity like we had last weeked.  Although the day I was there was productive, the amount of ice in the areas I was fishing was enough to annoy the most patient of people.  Its tough to stay away from that river though."
164940,spoonman,2008-02-27 03:55:00,103,Paul nice weekend for sure. I can't believe you got a musky. I will be coming down soon. Cheers Al
