I am interested in this section as it is close to home and deep enough to fish from the boat. My questions are as follows: 1.	Does sonar work in this shallow and rather brown water (even if only for depth finding)? 2.	Is trolling a good method of fishing this section (at least until you find a hole)? 3.	How well do crank baits work in this colour of water (or is live or power bait better)? Thanks in advance for anything that you can offer. Jim"

Trolling is okay in a few spots above the dam in Caledonia, tougher in other spots due to how shallow it gets in spots.  Look for the holes - 10 to 13 feet, verticle jigging works best.  I like white 5"" twisters with 1/2 oz Orange Jig Heads.  Good luck,  The fish are plenty if you key in on the right spots.  The Grand is a great piece of water to explore."
