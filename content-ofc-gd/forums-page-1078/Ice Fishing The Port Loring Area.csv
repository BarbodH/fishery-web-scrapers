Sure is nice when you can pull lakers/whities/walleye from the same hole eh!! Gotta love it!!  Thanks for the report, and the reminder than I HAVE to hit that area before the ice season is over!!  Sinker"

164460,solopaddler,2008-02-26 01:11:00,8605," Kerry, there's roughly 14"" of clear black ice. Since the big melt the week before there's zero slush and almost no snow, so conditions are perfect for travel.  Everyone else, thanks a bunch for the kind words  ."
164486,Bernie,2008-02-26 02:02:00,3190,"Good Stuff Solo, love your reports. I know the area east of there well. Our hunt camp isn't far away. I know a couple fellas that used to fish in that lake and others around it but they have gotten up in their years and don't head out anymore. They would go out to our camp and stay for the weekend and enjoy it as you did. There are a few good productive lakes in the area with a wide variety of species. Some of the smaller lakes in the area have limited access of trails to them though. Tom is a good fellow, haven't seen him for a few years. His sister and my wife are good friends. Spent a few days out there years ago in the summer. Nice spot."
