163942,kemper,2008-02-24 21:53:00,2232,"So this morning I was sitting on the couch watching fishing shows when I got the twitch. It was time to go fishing!  Packed up my float gear and left for the local trib determined to find some fishable water. I was greeted at one of my favourite spots with some open water (key word some) and perfect conditions. Three drifts in steelheal number one was on the line, a big strong male.    After the ice was broken, I got two more fish and lost a fourth all in ONE HOUR. I had limited time today because of assignments etc that need to be done for school and let me tell you it was the most amazing hour of the winter.  I kept the nice female for eggs and dinner, almost never keep them but I was out of roe...    Some more pictures from an amazing day...      back to the homework..."
163944,bassboy,2008-02-24 21:59:00,161,Nice job Kemper! You almost have me wanting to go out now  WTG!!   Some nice fish there!  Bill

163952,lew,2008-02-24 22:19:00,12767,"WTG Kemper, always good to see softwater fishing reports this time of year !!"
163953,lucabrasi,2008-02-24 22:21:00,114,I notice you're using a Fenwick rod. I'm eyeing one of these as my first float rod. Which model are you using and how do you like it.  lb
163959,kemper,2008-02-24 22:36:00,2232,"Its an older model, 10'6"" Fenwick HMX. I cant say enough about this rod, I have 4 float rods, all newer and some more expensive and this rod is still my favourite. You will not regret buying a fenwick."

164316,kennyman,2008-02-25 18:07:00,737,"What a gorgeous fish and pic. You could use that for an ad. Makes me want to try it for sure! Nice job. What reel are you using? Someday I'll be looking for a used setup and being it's your fave setup, maybe I'll file that info in the back of my brain for future reference. Man, I'm jealous. I should have started fishing twenty years ago. Soooo much to learn."
164379,kemper,2008-02-25 21:50:00,2232,"Thanks everyone, it sure was great to get out on the softwater.  Keep your eyes peeled for more reports, this is the season where I catch fish while everyone else sits around waiting for opener..."
