164504,Radnine,2008-02-26 02:49:00,1538,Congrats! Theres one off the to-do list.
164570,danbouck,2008-02-26 13:14:00,4380,It's a hard one isn't it
164576,ccmtcanada,2008-02-26 13:37:00,7971,I've been meaning to get this done this winter as well.  Congrats and thanks for the reminder!
164583,Stoty,2008-02-26 13:51:00,2910,"Its about time they finally put that into effect. I got mine literally about 6 years ago, when they first said it was going to come into effect.  Typical government for ya."
164602,irishfield,2008-02-26 14:36:00,26272,Real question is why did we need it at all. Has nothing to do with HOW to drive a boat.
164610,Terry,2008-02-26 14:52:00,14456,"I agree with Wayne, it seems to be a money grab and nothing more..it has nothing to do with safe boating......."
164611,Fish Farmer,2008-02-26 15:00:00,2234,"Mine is so old it fell apart. Now that you got it, it makes a big difference."
164613,Stoty,2008-02-26 15:05:00,2910," WHAT ISN'T these days? It's getting pathetic actually.  Cause everyone knows that we don't pay the government enough already (income tax, property tax, gst, pst, food, liquor, etc)."
164616,irishfield,2008-02-26 15:12:00,26272,"Yah.. but you're barking up the wrong tree.. None of this boaters card money goes to the government, it's all private business with no master record that the government can even xreference that you even have a card."
164622,gekhunter,2008-02-26 15:37:00,61,I think it was mainly put in place to put some sort of control on the sea-doos and from my (limited) experience there has been less sea-doo traffic since it was introduced...so that might be worth the $65 right there.
164637,Stoty,2008-02-26 16:13:00,2910,"Then it should be a ""sea-doo"" operators card, not boating in general."
164667,irishfield,2008-02-26 17:36:00,26272," Yah... but it shouldn't be $325 (based on your $65) from my family of 5, because others don't have the common sense to not let kids use PWC's... or adults for that matter that can't comprehend that you need POWER to turn the things.  The boaters card makes as much sense as me asking you 26 questions on air regs, you getting an 80% pass and me giving you the keys to my airplane.  You don't need a new card to regulate the age of PWC and boat drivers. Any photo ID they already own would be better proof when pulled over by the OPP vs a card that has no picture on it and could be their sisters...... or printed on any lazer printer for that matter."
164683,gekhunter,2008-02-26 18:11:00,61," have to agree with that, good point."
164687,gekhunter,2008-02-26 18:13:00,61,"Actually, when I did the test, the instructor said he had a couple who had been operating their 60 ft. yacht for  years but needed the license to operate the dingy....that is government for you."
164787,Woodsman,2008-02-26 23:24:00,1286," I agree with you about the PWC's(sea-doos). But $65?? I paid only $30 to challenge the test. Of course this didn't include ""you don't pass - you don't pay"". Two other providers were there with the ""you don't pass - you don't pay"" deal. One was $50 & I didn't inquire about the other. Read the ""Safe Boating Guide"" & know port form starboard & a cardinal buoy and a maker buoy and you should pass no problem. Multiple choice which in most cases you can rule out 2 of the 4 answers. Common sense will give you most of the other answers not covered in the guide. I scored 49 out of 50.  Best Wishes: Rick"
