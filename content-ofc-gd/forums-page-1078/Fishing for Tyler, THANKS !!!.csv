164528,bpsbassman,2008-02-26 04:59:00,941,Looks like you pulled off another wonderful event and experience Maureen.  Only sorry that I didn't get back from Florida soon enough to get sorted out and to help out. Bravo!!
164222,Squid,2008-02-25 13:23:00,1656,Another successful year Maureen. Excellent job by all.

Maybe next year we'll skip school to go ice fishing and if I had access to a truck like someone going thru GTA with a pickup, I could bring a giant charcoal BBQ that could quickly feed 150-200 as the event seems to have outgrown the BBQ's Cliff and company were working on."
