There is open (flowing) water less than 75 yards away !! The fishing must be spectacular to brave that location.  Call me overcautious, but wouldn't the ice thickness be unpredictable on a day to day basis ?  Peace, Nuke"
164585,BillM,2008-02-26 13:56:00,17367,Perhaps they are looking to make the list on the '08 Darwin awards?

164601,iceguy,2008-02-26 14:35:00,341,"There are open spots all year no matter how cold it is. As long as the ice is at least 4-5 under you and there is no open areas to blow your sheet off ice off your spot.. Spring fed speckle lake have springs that make ""blow holes""."

164676,Muskieman,2008-02-26 17:58:00,2472,"EH!   Nuke...I thought it was insane too...that's until I went down for myself in 1999...I've been going ever since..  As of this past sunday there is an even 21"" of ice down there..  within 50 yards of open current.  The bite is on in early January  dies off during February  and is just picking up now.  Usually at dusk is best."
164682,Muskieman,2008-02-26 18:09:00,2472,the dam  ..  and  look behind my line in the second pic  it was plowed with a F-150...they made a rink for some kind of Jug Curling thing.
164685,Muskieman,2008-02-26 18:12:00,2472,look in the back of my line...rink
164710,nuke,2008-02-26 19:31:00,60,"Cool pictures.  Remember killing the pickeral down below that house by the Sturgeon Lodge.  Well at least before the house was sold to new owners which took care of that. So close to open water still freaks me out, 21"" or not.  I guess it's safe to assume what species you're catchin ?  Later dude."
