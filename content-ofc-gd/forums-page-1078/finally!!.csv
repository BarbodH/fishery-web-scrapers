163960,Squid,2008-02-24 22:40:00,1656,"Well after weeks of pining and whining, I finally got out on the water for a bit of  . The Niagara river was chock full of small ice flows, pretty decent clarity with a water temperature of 31 degrees F. Quite a few boats and shore fishermen too. I spent the day with my brother Nick and we managed to land 2 bows. I will download the pictures shortly.    "

164005,Greencoachdog,2008-02-24 23:57:00,8163,"Great report and pics Pete!!!  31 degree water! that's gotta be some cold, nasty, and dangerous stuff!  It just amazes me how those cold water species of fish can live, feed, multiply, and thrive in an enviornment that would kill a human being in a matter of minutes."
164006,lew,2008-02-24 23:58:00,12767,"Awesome stuff Pete, I was hoping the weather & water conditions would stay good for you & your brother  this weekend.  Couple nice fish too."

164036,bucktail,2008-02-25 00:47:00,1857,Nice going Pete. Is it just me or is it the lighting. That one fish looks like a buck brown!
164045,Squid,2008-02-25 01:12:00,1656,"No I think that you are right Darren, you know them better than I do. The fish seem to pull hard but overall the fish is slow due to the cold water. It was nice to get slimed again."
164080,bucktail,2008-02-25 01:49:00,1857,Your turning into Mr Brown!!!   Sadly I am still Mr Pink!
164110,Joey,2008-02-25 02:30:00,9122,"Right on Pete, I am so jealous.  Ah, we'll get down there soon enough.  Nice fish bud, way to go  Joey"
164224,Squid,2008-02-25 13:24:00,1656,"It is alwasy a good day when you can launch the boat and catch some rays, fish are just the bonus part of the trip."
164226,Whopper,2008-02-25 13:36:00,2174,"Wow what in the heck is going on, Pete posting a fishing report with a pic and reefhawg and graftongal making an appearance on the ice, all we need now is for Canada Dave to rear his words of wisdom  Congrats Pete! Thanks for sharing"

164255,Alumacraft,2008-02-25 14:41:00,139,"Squid, it was a beautiful day out there I was out in the Alumacraft. I wish the guy in the little tinner would have been able to get in what ever he had on. He must have fought that thing for 45 min to an hour. I'm thinking it must have been a sturgeon,but I would have liked too seen him land it.I landed 3 for the day lost a couple you know on for a couple of seconds and gone."
