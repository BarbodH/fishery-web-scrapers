164248,snag,2008-02-25 14:26:00,1932,The day I see a carp choking on a musky is the day I start targeting them.
164249,bigfish1965,2008-02-25 14:33:00,3382,"Well I don't know what the definition of 'sportfish' is, so I can't respond to that, but jeez carper...I don't understand the hostility. There are many who would like to see carp gone since they are a non-native species. I'd like to see chinook salmon gone, myself, but I don't see many people getting quite so riled about it. Lots os people enjoy carp fishing, and like it or not, they are here to stay. We might as well learn to like them and adapt like the environment does."
164253,Spiel,2008-02-25 14:39:00,9065,"  Hmmmmm, I thought I was the only one."

164256,pikehunter,2008-02-25 14:45:00,1659,"Don't know why the anger either Rick   But I have said before that there is money to made from carp! Some people are on the edge of this tourism resource. I don't fish for them, but like you said some do. I would not toss them up on the bank myself.  I did have a European neighbour when I was a kid that had the greatest garden in Burlington because every Sunday he went fishing in Bronte Creek and almost every time he would bring a carp home for the garden. For him they provided a sport, entertainment and great big strawberries and tomatoes so they didn't go to waste."

(With all due respect to any and all those who may be lawyers or have members of their family etc... aw, who am I kindin ....  ) Grew up catchin Carp in the mighty Thames in London. Caught my share and probably a few others during that time... most went back in, but some made it home to my mom's roses and boy, do Carp make nice roses. It""s a coarse fish, always has been, always will be... that's why they make 'em look like that!LOL HH"
164274,Kirk,2008-02-25 15:53:00,347,"Although I really hate carp, I have to admit they are a sport fish...soccer  I don't know how anybody can use them for fertilizer for flowers with racoons and skunks digging them up, leaving only one option, the Pele Release  (thats an old one HH, good but old LOL)"
164315,Tacklebuster,2008-02-25 18:00:00,303,heard musky make great furtilzer too.
164317,Roy,2008-02-25 18:17:00,13728," Yeah but you need a long, thin garden for those. I don't care much for Y bones in my tomatoes either."
164336,aplumma,2008-02-25 18:53:00,6896,It would improve my chances of catching a muskie if you did start putting them in the garden.....   Art

164409,ch312,2008-02-25 23:50:00,1590," hmmm.....when i lived with my parents id bring home all sizes of carp to bury in the gardens. dig a hole, throw in the fish, chop with shovel, throw dirt back in hole. my moms flowers were always bigger than the neighbours even though they bought the same flowers from the same place each year as a ""tradition"" type deal. the only time that the fish got dug up is if i didnt put at least 6"" of soil over the fish.  lots of big females to be had in the spring as well as little 12 inchers for the frying pan"
164429,FishFinder,2008-02-26 00:30:00,481," Rick, theres a difference between non-native and invasive, im pretty sure carp is still on the invasive list. Sorry if someone already adressed this, didnt have time to read through all the posts."
164531,camillj,2008-02-26 06:01:00,1988,  True .. and if I am not mistaken ... so is the 'white-man'  By the way .... does anyone know what the final story was from last years big Carp die off in the Kawarthas ???
164543,Casey123,2008-02-26 11:34:00,461, Good Luck??
164568,ccmtcanada,2008-02-26 13:04:00,7971," Hmm...there were some explanations that just dont add up.  The govt's official story is that it was Columaris bacteria that caused it, yet they didn't find any in Scugog carp, where the die off began.  I think it had something to do with aliens....the truth is out there."
164569,holdfast,2008-02-26 13:13:00,1813,"My old man as a kid used to catch Carp from the St Lawrence and then sell it to the Jews in Mtl for their restaurants.  Apparently at the time they made for a good delicacy.  Kind wonder what and how they cooked it.  Then again there was a war going on.  As far as a sport fish, since when?  Must of changed like a lot of other things. LATELY"

163531,Photoz,2008-02-23 19:22:00,792,"Actually, they ARE tasty (similar to bass) and MANY people DO eat them. Hit some of the big fish markets downtown, and see what a live carp will set ya back. Although I'm not sure, I believe these are commercially caught?"
163543,Casey123,2008-02-23 20:43:00,461,"This is the best thing about our country, we are are entiled to our own opinions.   The irrefutable Facts:  Carp are an invasive species Carp Destroy wetlands Carp can live in water with very low oxygen levels and tolerate very high pollution Carp provide a hell of a fight Some people love eating bottom feeders We will never irradicate carp, no matter how hard I try.    By the way, the water quality in Cootes is not that bad, as it flows into Hamilton Harbour, not out of.  The pike hatchery has been inmproving since the installation of the Carp barrier. If you want to take an interesting trip, go down to the carp dam in the spring, April is best.  The MNR and volunteers work every day, recording species heading upstream and throwing the carp downstream of the barrier.  No carp are killed (too bad), just relocated back to Hamilton Harbour.  I guess next we will hear someone defending Round Gobies??"
163544,danbouck,2008-02-23 20:49:00,4380,I tried carp last year. I DO NOT recommend it lol! Can't quite explain the taste but I had to try it!
163547,Photoz,2008-02-23 20:57:00,792,"I've fished the carp barrier . . . .    never saw a pike taken out of the cages, (pike can survive in fairly tepid water too) lotsa bass . . . .    but I've seen some MASSIVE carp go back down the 'shute,' some I'd bet would have EASILY hit 50 pounds. Plus the occasional sheepshead too, but the carp come in there during the spawn . . . .    never caught one there, even with the water being loaded with 'em. Although I'd eat Kawartha & Lake Simcoe carp, I kinda draw the line at Hamilton Harbour carp . . . .    never thought of glow-in-the-dark fish as being very palatable. But . . . .    speaking of eating bottom-feeding fish, I'll take a ling any day of the week over any other fish in Ontario!"
163549,mercforever,2008-02-23 21:02:00,67,"remember the old man telling stories of them using lobster for fertilizer in the garden,back in cape breton,it used to be a poor man's meal.I guess the lobster have come a long way......."
163556,Photoz,2008-02-23 21:22:00,792,"LOBSTER . . . .  .   .      the cockroach of the ocean . . . .     and are considered by many as the top of the delicasy ladder? Cooked properly, ling have a similar taste!"

163570,Carp,2008-02-23 22:25:00,1488,All this negativity regarding carp.  Nobody loves me. I think I'm going to cry!
163575,troutologist,2008-02-23 22:33:00,951,My grandma always was looking for some fish to bury in the garden come spring. they used to dip suckers. Once my cousin and I got old enough we started bowfishing....15 fish did for the whole garden. Stunk a bit but they were a foot under the earth
163624,Fishnwire,2008-02-24 00:07:00,983,"My neighbour used to put my smelt heads and guts in her garden.  She was a pretty good gardener, so she must have known what she was doing.  Letting fish die on the shore and not eating them just seems wrong to me.  The fact that some species are invasive and destructive is a compelling argument though...........So I guess I'm adding nothing to this discussion."
163642,Rich,2008-02-24 00:57:00,3927,"Lots of people use them as fertilizer. Kinda seems like a waste to me. Spend all that time fishing for, and reeling in these brutes just to toss them in a garden. I'm sure it works. IMO toss gobies in your garden and leave the carp. Killing off one or two won't help anything. Whereas killing off 5000 gobies for your garden, well that might leave a dent in the immediate area where you caught them. lol"

163728,Marko,2008-02-24 05:08:00,854,"I was raised and taught to treat fish with respect and every other fisherman fishing around me. If you dont want to eat the damn thing then let it go, there is no point in catching and killing it and leaving it there to rot and smell for other fishermen who might be fishing nearby."
163740,troutologist,2008-02-24 07:48:00,951,"Im not gonna say what I have done is implicitly right, but this is what my family has done for 75+ yrs. If the MNR allows bowfishing for certain species there may be some scientific basis for this."
163741,pikehunter,2008-02-24 09:56:00,1659," Brave man, very brave man.  When I was young and fished the Grand with my father he would toss the carp and suckers on the shore to let them integrate back into the ecosystem, a word no one heard of back then! But they never lasted long enough to rot. Some ""foreigner"" would come along and ask if he could have them? Sure take them all and the next one I catch you can have it too was his answer.  As a teen my buddies would spear suckers in Rambo Creek in Burlington, I never joined in with the fun as it never occurred to me that standing on the creek bank with a spear in my hand would much fun and I thought that just spearing suckers and tossing them up on the bank was pointless. Today there are no suckers spawning in that creek, at least that part of it anyway. This could be due to the city diverting about 1/2 the water to a concrete channel for flood control and who knows maybe too many were speared?"
163751,Rich,2008-02-24 12:08:00,3927,The funniest part about the fertilizer thing... people don't eat these carp because they are so big and full of pollutants. So they throw them in their garden. I guess they don't think all those pollutants will grow right into the vegetables?
163757,lew,2008-02-24 12:36:00,12767,"Hey Rich, your new signature is hilarious hahaha  That'd make a great bumper sticker"
163784,bigfish1965,2008-02-24 14:01:00,3382,"Are carp a non-native species? Yes... But so are chinook salmon, rainbow trout and smallmouth bass. The carp's size and feeding method does lead to some habitat damage but nearly ever lake that has them, has adapted to it. Good thing about nature....it an usually survive whatever stupidity we throw at it."
163798,fishing,2008-02-24 15:08:00,167,"I release the fish. Over the years I saw people catch hundreds of fish, around 95% of them were released. About 5% were kept. Some people think small carp taste good. Many people enjoy fighting them. Saw only one fish was left on shore dying. Its eyeball was missing, a bird must have taken it."
163803,Casey123,2008-02-24 15:31:00,461,"If someone wants to dispatch of a carp and use it as fertalizer aka. worm food, I say great, as long as they are not breaking any laws.  If someone wants to through a fish on shore and watch it sufficate, well to me that is just plain sick. As with any fish we keep, they should be dispatched in a humane and quick manner. I don't think we should be promoting cruelty toward and fish species."

163964,pikehunter,2008-02-24 22:45:00,1659,WOW! Such harsh words have been spoken. I guess we have to say good bye Good Bye
164020,Rizzo,2008-02-25 00:31:00,4754," I didn't really think we were discussing whether carp were sport fish or not.  I couldn't care less if its a sportfish.  If I find one that makes it into our small, land-locked lake I'm taking it out for reasons previously mentioned."
163505,Casey123,2008-02-23 17:13:00,461,"Photoz,  I guess we could say the same aboutLamprey Eels, Goby, Spiny Scalpins, etc., etc., etc.....  RBG has spent millions to rid Cootes paridise of carp, seeing as they have destroyed a once productive Pike hatchery for the entire Western Basin of Lake Ontario.  Also if you visit Jordan Harbour they have completely destroyed Jordan Bay, beside the train tressel.  Granted any 25 lb fish will put up a hell of a fight, and in Asia where they are a native species, I am sure that they are highly prized, however that does not mean that having had them realesed here makes them a good choice for a sports fish.  This is not just about Carp, look at the problems SmallMouth have caused when being realsed in many of the traditional Lake Trout Lakes in and around Algonquin Park.  All of this being said, Carp are not our only, or biggest problem, other invasive species, pollution, over fishing etc., all create stresses on our fishiers.  I don't think we should promote any of these things.  In addition to the problems with Carp in Cootes, Stelco, Doffasco and other heavy industry have completely destroyed the White Fish and Lake Trout Hatchery that was once world renowned(turn of the century) in Hamilton Harbour.  The clean up estimate for Hamilton Harbour is estimated at over $750 Million Dollars, in additon the cost to industry to switch to clean none polluting manufacturing is in the Billions.  The reality is carp are here to stay, that being said I think we should do what we can to mitigate their damages, and remove as many as we can from our water ways.  We have been so sucessful over fishing Walleye and Trout in many regionsof the province, to the point that without restocking they would be wiped out in local areas, wouldn't it be nice to do the same to carp; minus the restocking!  JUst my thoughts(and I am entiled to them, so don't start with the hate posts)"
163506,e-z-out,2008-02-23 17:26:00,1052,Well i've fished in Rice lake most of my life with my dad and we know a few guys that catch them and eat them. But never have a seem someone just just kill them for fun. Like other memebers have said fish belong in water not land unless you plan on eating it.
163514,Spiel,2008-02-23 17:55:00,9065," ....Well on this point I must disagree. Whitefish (freshwater whitefish are fish of the subfamily Coregoninae in the family Salmonidae which includes the freshwater and anadromous trout and salmon species) are a native species and in no way are comparable to carp (large member of the minnow family). They prefer cold or cool waters and are not destructive to the enviroment. They do not have ""sucker mouths"" but rather a small under slung mouth below a rounded snout. I can also attest to them being active top water feeders (great on the dryfly) and suspending, not always the bottom sucking type fish they are often perceived to be. The bodies are elongated and latererally compressed and they also sport an adipose fin common to the salmonidae family. Suffice to say other than moderately large scales they in no way are comparable to carp.   As for leaving them on the ground to rot, it will solve nothing."
163522,Photoz,2008-02-23 18:53:00,792,"Carp also take flies & other insects from the surface, and pick off snails & other molusks from the weed beds, well above bottom. Also they eat zebra mussels. Yes . . . .     they DO root around in the mud, but usually the reason when the carp move into an area, it gets so you see less & less of other fish, is because the water quality has gotten so bad, other fish just can't survice. A few example of carp co-existing with other fish . . . .     Bowmanville Creek . . . .   pike still come into the adjacent marshland, along with bass . . .    rainbows and browns abound in the spring & fall . . .    and once the salmon start comin' into Oshawa Creek, Bowmanville Creek & the Ganaraska . . . .    (in late summer) the CARP disappear! It will be interesting just how OTHER fish species repopulate Cootes with the carp gone? The water quality is so bad, it just might be that carp, catfish and other 'garbage fish' are the only ones that can survive cesspools like that. I fished carp in a marshy area just east of Liverpool Road in Pickering where the water was the colour of old antifreeze, and the entire area had an oil-like slick on the surpace, these fish were just as fiesty as the ones in Lake Simcoe & the Kawartha Lakes, and looked just as healthy. I highly doubt ANY other fish could survive in there! True . . . .    there MAY be SOME area where carp do dig the plants out, and do damage . . .   but, considering the THOUSANDS of square miles of waterways in this province where they attract torrists in droves, with their money, and do no harm, I'd say the areas where they might be detrimental, is miniscule, by comparison. Then . . . . .    who's to say if the water quality in many of these areas would support ANY other species except carp, if the carp were gone? I too used to detest carp and stuck my nose in the air when the subject of carp fishing arose . . .    ""KILL 'EM ALL, POISON 'EM, SHOOT 'EM, DYNAMITE 'EM, STOMP 'EM, AND LEAVE 'EM TO ROT, were some of the ideas I had . . . .    then I opened my mind . . . . ."
163527,Riparian,2008-02-23 19:12:00,269,"If they were tasty, people would eat them. If people harvested them like other fish they wouldnt be so destructive.  There is a reason people dont eat them.  Granted this species was farmed in asia for food for thousands of years. But no carp angler can deny that carp are an invasive and destructive species.  Throwing them on the shore wont solve anything, its just a drop in the bucket in our changing ecosystem."
