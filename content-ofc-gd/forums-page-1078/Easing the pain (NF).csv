I'd always had a dog or dogs in my life, when my last one had to be put down for cancer, it was so hard on me, I swore I'd never have another.  I didn't realize that something was missing in my life, but my children did.  They kept trying to talk me into getting another dog, but I wouldn't allow it.  Then 3 Christmas's ago, my oldest daughter bought me a dog for xmas.  What was I to do?  When I first had her at home, although 5-6 years had passed, I still had those same mixed feelings an emotions, and wasn't sure I wanted her.  It didn't take to long for me to warm up to her and love her to peaces just as I had the others.  I like the name you picked.... I called my new girl Kia too..      only I spell it... Kea   Today, I wonder how I lived without her...   My children were smart enough to know I had a void in my life and I thank them now... I think thats a great thing your wife and daughter did for you..... won't take long and you'll feel the same and be happy to be making new memories with this one....  Good luck with your new girl...."

I knew I heard that name before and remembered that your little one is also named Kea.  OK.  So come this June, when we're all in camp ... just remember.   When any of us yells  KEA or KIA. someone may very well get two dogs.  We've only had her a little over 24 hours now and it sure looks like we are gonna have another great partner.  I still have to get across to her that we really don't want yellow carpets ... but that will come in time."
