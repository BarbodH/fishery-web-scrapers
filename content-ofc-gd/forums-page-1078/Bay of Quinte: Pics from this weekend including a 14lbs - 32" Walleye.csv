164368,huntervasili,2008-02-25 21:10:00,1604," Its unfortunate that you think this way and make such quick judgments and generalizations. Its the guy who caught the fish's decision, and being fully legal he did nothing wrong. I for one agreed with Nater on his post before where he caught the musky and ate it because I know that he did try to revive it and was unsuccessful, so ensured it was not wasted. All I am asking of you Evinrude-Dude is avid making such rude and uncalled for generalizations."
164373,irishfield,2008-02-25 21:16:00,26272,I guess everyone missed the part about the 14lb fish being DOA ! Keep it or turtle food... I think he made the right decision.
164392,solopaddler,2008-02-25 22:50:00,8605,The self righteous attitude that some seem to have certainly doesn't reflect very well on them...
164407,lookinforwalleye,2008-02-25 23:39:00,4399,I can`t imagine myself ever keeping such a magnificent fish but the angler was within his legal right. I just hope we all remember this thread the next time someone cooks a Musky.
164408,Nater,2008-02-25 23:43:00,68,"self righteous? care to elaborate assuming that comment was directed towards me?  I acknowledged that they were good fish, and that Jeff is a very good guide, I was only concerned with fish of that size being harvested.  I don't grasp the concept.  Ever killed a 20 lb steelhead Mike?  You could even LEGALLY kill 2 that size, however I HIGHLY doubt you would.  I'm sure if you saw a 20 lb hen with it's gills ripped out lying on the bank you'd have a few words to mutter about it.  You might not say anything directly to the person but I'm sure you'd be ticked off inside about it.  Just because you are within your rights doesn't make it right to kill a trophy fish.  Glad to see there are a few people on here with some spinal chord who are willing to speak their minds.  It's much more difficult to stand up for something you feel is wrong and face the wrath of the  OFC brotherhood, then to jump on the bandwagon that beleives if you're within your legal rights everyone else must be jealous if they feel otherwise .  I'm sure there are others reading this thread who feel the same way but don't feel like posting because they fear someone might jump all over them for it.  Have a wonderful spring, may all of your coolers be filled with 14lb walleye, 20 lb steelhead, and 54"" musky  Nate"
164411,Corey,2008-02-26 00:01:00,355,"First off... nice fish, I am jealous.  Now... for all you people who are complaining, I thought we had a thread or two not too long ago where we came to a consensus that as long as the catch is legit, we're not going to tear people a new one. Apparently some of you haven't read that. Ethics aside, those fish are legit. If you decide you are going to throw back big fish, kudos to you, that's your perogative. There's nothing wrong with keeping fish, not even a musky. Yes I know there's a certain ""old boys musky club"" here, but they are abiding by the ""it's ok if it's legit"" consensus we have reached.  Let's keep ethics out of reports and let people show what they have legally caught here. Nate... you just keep going and going. If I was in the old boys club I would give you a warning to keep your beliefs and ethics out of other peoples reports. Nobody asked you for what you consider your ethical opinion. Go have a seat in the corner dude.  cd."
164413,Golfisher,2008-02-26 00:06:00,586,"Is it just me that read Jeff's explanation, that he (or his client) kept the fish because it couldn't be revived?  So much anger for so little reason."
164441,solopaddler,2008-02-26 00:55:00,8605," Easy there Nate, it's not a great idea to make assumptions about anybody least of all myself."
164482,Moosebunk,2008-02-26 01:55:00,3970,"Nice fish man.  Yeah, I'd likely mount that before I eat it...  Man, I kept an 8.5lb'er last year and felt like a heel putting a knife to it later that day... that was the only fish of the year I felt that way about.  Likely won't do that again though... plenty of good eater-sized fish out there to take it's place at the table.  Thing about them big fish and keeping them in the gene pool is, that big fish has likely been swimming around with a few hundred of it's children now for a few years.  There's likely one or two kids spawning themselves and spreading them big-momma genes down the line.  If it was DOA as said than there's definitely no-harm no-foul done.  Toxins as someone said... I dunno.  The Guide to Eating Ontario Sportfish doesn't reccommend any servings of walleye that large out of Quinte, but heck... if you're living in the GTA your likely decreasing your lifespan through many other means anyways.  Thanks for the report.  Wish I could catch a walleye that big on 6lb through a hole in the ice."
164513,Crazyhook,2008-02-26 03:41:00,1154,Nice fish!  I am scared to read the posts coming in May during peak OOS time
164519,FishFinder,2008-02-26 04:21:00,481,"Nice Fish I love the died during the fight excuse, cant argue that one Nater."
164526,Jeff_C,2008-02-26 04:53:00,50,"Sorry to stir the pot so much with this thread.  In case anyone didn't catch my second post on this thread, the fish was fatally hooked and was not going to survive.  It is never our intention to keep any fish over 4lbs, however from time to time, there are some fish that unfortunately do not survive.  I myself have not had this happen this year, but our group did have two fish get fatally hooked this past Saturday.  We all agreed that it was unfortunate, but there is nothing that can be done.  I was pleased to see the group respect the fishery and release all of the 4+lb fish that were fit to be released.  It is always the angler's choice if they are to keep or release, however we encourage releasing all fish greater than 4lbs.  Jeff"
164565,Jeff_C,2008-02-26 13:00:00,50,Thanks for all of the comments anyway.    It is an amazing fishery.  Jeff
164648,trapshooter,2008-02-26 16:54:00,1234,"Jeff - kudos to you for having a conservation policy that goes above and beyond the regs.  Not much you can do when a fish dies from some deep hooks.  I would have kept it and had it mounted as well, although I would feel bad about having a true trophy like that die at my hands.  It's not surprising to me that you took a bit of flack for posting that pic of the dead 14lber.  Same would happen with a pic of a dead 55"" muskie or any true trophy that wasn't C&R'd.  Hope this won't stop you from posting more reports.  Cheers and good fishing,  ben"
163806,Jeff_C,2008-02-24 15:43:00,50,"The boys did their homework well this week with some very successful pre-fishing for this weekend.  Yesterday morning we landed on a serious school of fish.  They found the masses as well as a few that had just visit the gizzard shad buffet.  Our guys iced an 11.5lb, a 10lb, and Ryan iced this 14lb - 32"" Walleye.  Everyone caught fish, and some caught a lot of fish.  With perfect weather, and plenty of fish, it was an amazing day.  Did I mention the perfect on ice fish fry!  Good luck to all...  Jeff  Ryan's 14lbs - 32"" Walleye   From a different angle   11.5lbs   Two angler's limit. "

163821,medmart,2008-02-24 16:16:00,587,Those are assume eyes WTG on that 14lb  rob
163898,Nater,2008-02-24 19:23:00,68,"that 14lber musta been tasty   why do people take fish that size out of the gene pool? unbeleiveable  Nate  Nice job, just a shame that those monster walleye are being killed"
163900,Greencoachdog,2008-02-24 19:29:00,8163, As long as they were within the regs... there isn't a problem.   Unless you're jealous...
163902,bassman,2008-02-24 19:32:00,384,"Agreed GCD, nothing wrong with eating a big fish if you're within the regs."
163908,Sebastian,2008-02-24 20:12:00,208,Nice fish for sure but i have to agree with Nate. Whats the point of eating that fish? yes yes i know walleye are apparently great to eat but a 14lber out of Lake Ontario........mmmmm toxic lol   GCD there is no jealousy intended there at all.  Nice fish
163918,Sandbag,2008-02-24 21:00:00,533,"Great catch....looks like you guys had a blast.  Every once in a while all the stars line up (weather, friends, fish bite )etc.  Makes for a trip you will never forget.  Looks to me like you guys had one of those trips  Always amazes me when you get back and try to share a bit of what you experienced with others there is always someone willing to provide you with a bit of flack.  Enjoy your fish  Cheers  Craig"
163937,Fang,2008-02-24 21:39:00,1330,Jeff  What the size on the other 2 - nice fish and well within your rights to keep for sure
163945,DanTheMan,2008-02-24 22:02:00,257,  Thats why I dont post anymore.Better off just reading other stories and enjoying them
163983,Gerritt,2008-02-24 23:20:00,6129,"You guys are nuts... he is within the law, he caught a nice fish and you come here to only to complain he kept it.... Nater you are something else...   It is a nice fish and I am thankful for the report... I could care less if he eats it, mounts it, or purees it for a protein shake... He was within the law and it is a memory he will never forget  I can think of alot worse things I have seen on the river from steelheaders then this fellow keeping a trophy pickeral.. Good on him and CONGRATS on a nice fish!  DantheMan! nice to see you again brother! ... please if you have a report pm it to me! I would not bash your for keeping a nice fish! LOL...  G."
163984,huntervasili,2008-02-24 23:22:00,1604,"Nice fish...Yup, within the regs, so no problems. Some of you are too quick to judge, he could have wanted his once in a lifetime trophy skin mounted, no wrong there. Thanks JeffC"
164003,Nater,2008-02-24 23:56:00,68,"Far as I'm concerned you are all terribly hypocritical...I seem to remeber a certain thread this fall where a guy who kept a musky got his head ripped off    Well within his rights yet you guys still tore him a new excellent person? I see the logic now    ... I'll be sure to report when I catch myself a nice 54"" musky this summer and harvest it for a meal  I never said they weren't good fish, and I know that they are doign well compared to most people on quinte.  I just think it's a shame fish like that get killed with the technology we have there is no need for skin mounts so you can't use that as en excuse...  He is a very good guide I just think maybe it'd be better for the fishery if releasing big fish was encouraged.  Nate"
164010,ehg,2008-02-25 00:10:00,2666,"Sounds like a real amazing day! Those are real amazing fish especially the 14 lber. In the 90's walleye's thru the ice at Quinte was my favorite fishing. It died down in the early 2000's but looks to be coming back! Have to head down there next winter! Great fish, ehg"
164022,solopaddler,2008-02-25 00:32:00,8605,"Great looking fish, congrat's!"
164033,Radnine,2008-02-25 00:42:00,1538,"This giant pickerel raises a question that perhaps could be a thread of it’s own rather than piggy backing, but here goes: I wonder how you catch a brute like that on spindly little ice fishing rigs? And if you can, then why do we use 7’ rods etc. in the summer? Nice fish by the way."
164127,Jeff_C,2008-02-25 02:51:00,50,"Just a couple of comments:  First of all, this 14lb fish was actually caught on a medium light St. Croix rod with 6lb mono.  Ryan had to prove a point, and was very successful in doing so.  Personally, I still like my 32H St. Croix that is cut down to 29"".  (Although, that one blew up on a fish last night... grr..)  We always encourage the releasing of the larger fish, and most of the fish caught yesterday were released.  Two anglers did keep a limit each, but the large group kept a couple of 2-3lb fish and threw back a plethora of 5-6lbers.  Unfortunately we had two large fish get fatally hooked or both of these would have been released as well.  (The 10lber was successfully released.)  We ourselves try to never keep any fish over 4lbs.  With all of the fish that we catch, why would we.  There are plenty of 2-3lb fish that we can selectively harvest.  Jeff"
164165,danc,2008-02-25 04:06:00,4677,Beauty fish Jeff. I agree with those that said that you are within your legal rights.
164169,danbo,2008-02-25 04:26:00,2646,I'd get that biggun' mounted by a good taxidermist.

164365,EVINRUDE-DUDE,2008-02-25 21:00:00,39,GOOD ON YOU NATER.I FULLY AGREE WITH YOU.MOST BIG FISH ARE FEMALES AND THE BEST BREEDERS.THEY SAY NOT TO EAT A FISH OVER 4LBS IN ONTARIO SO YES A 14LB WALLEYE IS FULL OF TOXINS.HOPE YOU DIDN'T FEED THAT TO YOUR FAMILY .I ALSO REMEMBER THAT MUSKIE POST AND ALL YOU GUYS JUMPED ALL OVER HIM BUT IT IS OKAY FOR A GUY TO KEEP A 14LB WALLEYE.DON'T YOU THINK THE OTHER WALLEYE YOU HAD WERE ENOUGH.AND NATER YOU HAVEN'T NOTICED THE LITTLE BOYS CLUB ON THIS BOARD ......???? IT IS ONLY OKAY FOR CERTAIN BOARD MEMBERS TO COMPLAIN WHILE THE REST OF US HAVE OUR POSTS EDITED IF WE DON'T AGREE WITH THE ALMIGHTY ON THIS BOARD.AS FAR AS THE EXCUSE OF .....WELL MAYBE HE WAS MOUNTING IT...CAUGHT A 12LB THROUGH THE ICE LAST YEAR TOOK A FEW QUICK PICTURES AND MEASUREMENTS AND BACK SHE WENT AND I HAD A GRAPHITE REPLICA MADE  SO SHAME ON YOU FOR KILLING A TROPHY FISH.PROBABLY GOING TO PUT IT IN YOUR GARDEN AREN'T YOU lol
