164843,CRAPPIE,2008-02-27 00:57:00,213,Can someone tell me where to park in Innisfil beach road and do i have to pay for parking?How far i have to walk after park and when is the season close for whitefish and lakers.  would like to go this sunday!  Thanks in advance!
164856,Dondorfish,2008-02-27 01:10:00,1000,"Go straight to the very end of Innisfil Beach Road. When you can't go any further, hang a left into the park. Follow the road around to the boat launch and find a parking spot. parking is free. As far as how far a walk - your guess is as good as anyones!. I have my hut (big blue one with black roof) straight out from the boat launch. We are in 80 fow at that point - dosen't get much deeper there. So far we managed to pick up one 4 lb whitey and thats it! ( this past sunday ). I can't believe that we are catching perch in 80 fow - whats with that! I will be out there on saturday and staying over till sunday - so if your by - drop in and say hi!   Don"
164861,CRAPPIE,2008-02-27 01:14:00,213,"Thanks Don, how is the ice there, and when is the season close for whitefish, can i use medium size minnow?  Thanks again!"
164868,Dondorfish,2008-02-27 01:23:00,1000,Ice was great on sunday - had to be at least 12 - 14 inches - saw a few full size trucks go by the hut - not for me thou - i'll stick with the atv or sled. I believe that lake trout and whities both close on Mar 15 - but it could be Mar 31 - please check the regs. I stop on the 15th - as thats when the huts have to be off the ice - then I bring out the portable and fish for perch. Good luck if you venture out and post how you did. ( don't forget the camera! )   Don
164869,Dondorfish,2008-02-27 01:25:00,1000,Sorry - forgot to add - medium size minnows are fine .  Don
164870,irishfield,2008-02-27 01:25:00,26272,Yah it was a little thin for my liking out by fox with three trucks there with us. 6 inches of real ice and 5 inches of slush ice on top... I measured it with the tape. In by your hut Don... I had 15 or 16 inches total..
164882,Dondorfish,2008-02-27 01:40:00,1000,"I haven't ventured out that far yet, Wayne but we are thinking about maybe checking out the area a little deeper. Hey Wayne - how did the UHMW board work out on your cutter sleigh - I contacted the company in Vineland that you posted the link to, and he's going to cut to fit the pieces that I need. What thickness do you reccomend?   Don"
164884,irishfield,2008-02-27 01:43:00,26272,"I can pull it around with 2 fingers when loaded up!  I use 1/8"" for aircraft skis without issue. Consider we land at about 50 to 60 MPH and it doesn't tear or creap on planes up to about 2000 lbs. Bigger A/C I use 3/16ths"
164888,Dondorfish,2008-02-27 01:47:00,1000,Thanks Wayne - guess I can cancel the 1/4 inch stuff and save a few bucks!!!   Don
164890,irishfield,2008-02-27 01:51:00,26272,Just extra weight. May or may not last longer it's a crap shoot.
164899,Dondorfish,2008-02-27 02:03:00,1000,Ok ty - I'll stick with the 1/8 inch stuff. It will probably outlast the sleigh anyways! How do you fasten it on ( wooden skis ) - i have never worked with this material before.   Don
164903,irishfield,2008-02-27 02:14:00,26272,I'll PM you... taking Crappie off track here...
164905,Dondorfish,2008-02-27 02:17:00,1000,Ok - thanks Wayne.  Crappie - sorry about that - and good luck on sunday - drop by the hut if you need a hot coffee   Don
164906,Mike the Pike,2008-02-27 02:17:00,3421,  WTG Don good to see your catching fish again  keep it up Don.Where is the pics
