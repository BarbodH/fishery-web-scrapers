164396,Muskieman,2008-02-25 22:55:00,2472,This is my neck of the woods   and we spend alot of time   w/  the kids....most locals are dead set against it..  However  the  people that will gain financially are all for it.
164436,Casey123,2008-02-26 00:51:00,461,Is there apetition I can sign?   My wife and I head up to Noelville at least a couple times a year.  It would be nice if we down here could learn to take care of our own garbage problems instead of shipping it to our neighbours.
127966,Handlebarz,2007-10-29 23:48:00,3790,Is the dump just west of London along the 401 different from this one proposed there? if not then there will be many who are not happy with the smell as anyone who passes london on the way to windsor will tell you it STINKS.  I to am not to thrilled with the garbage heading north they should be able to find some land closer to the south and yes I do deal with these smelly garbage trucks daily as they head to MI to dump there load and even right here in good Ol Chatham Kent we take alot of T.O. garbage already so I know it stinks and you can smell it on the way to the lake if you pass by.  I think it will take more then the locals to fight this one it will be all of us who head north to put up the fight for them and must stay strong
128210,Cory,2007-10-30 20:35:00,170,"I guess recycle555 doesn't want to answer my questions, or can't.  My letter to the town went in the mail yesterday.  Hopefully others make their opinion heard as well.  Going by the response to this thread I guess not though.  Oh well, I'll be following the events closely."

131622,lunkerbasshunter,2007-11-08 21:10:00,2585,"mr eh,   I drive that stretch of highway all the time.  THe dump west of london is a joke.  On a windy day the garbage is blown across the 401.  what a joke that is!  im with bite me, build a great big incinerator that produces power!"
131641,Guest lundboy,2007-11-08 22:06:00,0,"I live 3 blocks away from the Newmarket ""facility"".  It stinks to no end when I am down wind, can't open windows, sit outside etc.  And I get pretty tired of having to close all the vents in my car when driving by (which means within 1 km each way) of it on the 404.  Funny because I also own property up in Alban so I'll be getting it in both places.  AND....  The reason they are building it in Noelville, is so they can meet a court decision to fix the stink in Newmarket, by only processing the waste HALF WAY at the NM facility, and then truck it up to Noelville to finish the processing when it stinks the most."
131644,Guest lundboy,2007-11-08 22:16:00,0," The mayor and council are corrupt and on the take.  They have ignored people to the state of arguments about this.  Same with a previous council when it came to the mandatory waste bin system.  There was a time when the French River council was run by ""old family"" members like Mayer, Lemieaux, Beaulieu, Seguin, Lahaie, Rochon etc.  By someone that had a stake and roots in the town.  This new council and mayor came out of nowhere, people in town are still wondering how they got elected."
131659,Gerritt,2007-11-08 22:59:00,6129,  Careful with that.... Hamilton did that and it failed miserably ..... it is now abandoned.... millions wasted...

131995,Guest lundboy,2007-11-09 22:49:00,0,"Just heard from French River.  The Council had a public meeting on Wednesday, and declared that there was never a ratified amendment passed to rezone the area for use as a recycling business.  The funny thing is, there were people at previous meetings that were present when the council argued that the amendment was approved and ratified and that they were going ahead with the permit.  (sounds to me like they lied and someone caught them).  Looks like it will not be going ahead now."
