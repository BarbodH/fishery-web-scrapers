In the past I have always carried a spare prop in the boat, but have yet to get one for the new rig. Anybody have any experience with ""composite"" props or anything new to try?  Have heard some things about the Piranha props but  not too sure  about this ""plastic prop"" stuff. Currently running a 19"" pitch & am very pleased with the overall performance so far. A friend suggested a Stainless Steel prop but I usually fish Stoney Lake a lot and it is very aptly named!!  Thanks for any replies,  FT"
