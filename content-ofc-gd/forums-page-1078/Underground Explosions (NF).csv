I took the train today, so I never even looked out on Yonge.  Good thing I did though since traffic was all closed off.  Here's the news story....  http://www.citynews.ca/news/news_20005.aspx  Hydro Explosion Causes Huge Power Outage Tuesday February 26, 2008 CityNews.ca Staff  Just in time for rush hour, a block of roads in Toronto's north end are shut down. A hydro vault exploded, sending black smoke into the air, around 3pm Tuesday.  Power is out from Bathurst west to Bayview and St. Clair north to Eglinton. Eglinton has reopened, after it was closed to traffic from Yonge to Mt Pleasant. The closure lasted for almost three hours at the height of the evening commute.  It appears that the blast was caused by an electrical shortage. Denise Attallah, spokesperson for Toronto Hydro, said that power is nearly restored. ""Fire services and crews are on working to determine the damage and start repairing,"" she confirmed.  No one was hurt."
