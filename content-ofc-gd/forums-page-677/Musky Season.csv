471861,Kawartha Kev,2010-06-02 14:06:00,281,What is the opening date for musky fishing in the Kawarthas this year? I heard it might be extended it was always the first Sat. in June but I heard it might be a week earlier so is it already open? I can't seem to access the MNR fishing site to check does anyone know for sure?  Kawartha Kev
