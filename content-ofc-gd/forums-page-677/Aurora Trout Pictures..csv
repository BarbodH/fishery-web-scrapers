471318,Nipfisher,2010-05-31 16:25:00,2449,No pics T.J. but I have seen quite a few caught back in the 1990s. There is a lake in Esker Lakes Prov. Park just east of Kirkland Lake that has Aurora Trout in it. I think the lake is only open for 2 days of the year but I have seen quite a few come out of it.
471327,bassman87,2010-05-31 16:48:00,586,i have pictures of atlantic salmon that look identical to brown trout if youre interested
471328,TJQ,2010-05-31 16:48:00,7806,Thanks!! I just need authentic Aurora Trout pics!!
471329,Terry,2010-05-31 16:55:00,14456,"I caught a bass in Aurora Ontario once I have that picture...LOL  I love the colours on them, I was to fish for them on Carol but they closed the lake just before my trip...never got back"
471334,BillsTheBassMan,2010-05-31 17:04:00,932,"Hey TJ,  I'd be interested in learning more about the Aurora Trout.  From my brief research, I've learned that they were extirpated from the wild and hatchery produced for some decades and have been reintroduced to the wild.  Apparently, another die-off of Aurora trout is happening again now due to acidic rain and high acid levels in lakes (despite the introduction of lime to the same lakes).  Is this fish just doomed?  Can it possibly thrive in our lakes?  I see there have been some documentations of natural reproduction.  Also, is the Aurora Trout also a char like the brookie?  Ryan"
471336,Spiel,2010-05-31 17:06:00,9065,  A little info here..... http://www.rom.on.ca/ontario/risk.php?doc_type=fact&id=61&lang=en
471340,BillsTheBassMan,2010-05-31 17:13:00,932, Thanks Spiel!  Let's hope the recovery project works and that people remember the fragility of this fish should the time come that it is open to the public for a longer period of time.

471392,TC1OZ,2010-05-31 20:30:00,987,Epic picture! I wish I could help TJ! Sorry.

471421,danjang,2010-05-31 22:23:00,148,I don't remember where I read/heard this but apparently some guy had a brood stock of these at his hatchery and was about to scrap them. But later found out that they were actually extirpated so he kept them. They are the most beautiful fish in Ontario in my opinion!
471426,Pope29,2010-05-31 22:49:00,29,I assure every disrespectful fishermen on this board that not only do Aurora trout not exist but the locations people have so dutifully doled out are also bogus.  I do get a good chuckle every time the pic of the short shorts dude holding that Speckie is posted though
471438,Terry,2010-05-31 23:31:00,14456," what the heck are you talking about the MNR stocked lakes with them with pure strain Aurora trout Open Lakes For Aurora Trout in Ontario  Subject to changes without Notice  Aurora Trout Photo: Peter Sale     Features: The Aurora Trout (Salvelinus fontinalis timagamiensis) is a unique genetic stock of the Brook Trout. It is so-named because the colours of its sides are purple. It lives in a few,remote, high- elevation lakes in the Temagami District of Ontario.  Status: Endangered Provincially and Nationally  Range: The Aurora Trout was originally found in two lakes in the Montreal River system, a tributary of the Ottawa River in Ontario. The Aurora Trout has been reintroduced into both lakes where it originally occurred. The fish are now reproducing naturally in one of these lakes. Populations have also been established in some new lakes. The Brook Trout is widespread in North America. Range Maps  Threats: The Aurora Trout was extirpated in its natural range due to acid rain and other forms of pollution which disrupted reproduction. Low pH from acid precipitation and runoff is a continuing threat to the Aurora Trout in the wild.  Protection: The Aurora Trout is listed under Ontario's Endangered Species Act, 2007, which protects the species in its original lakes from being killed, harmed, captured, or possessed. Aurora Trout have been maintained in captivity by the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources since they were extirpated from the wild. Reintroduction back into the original lakes, in combination with the addition of lime to the water to neutralize the pH of these lakes, has allowed the population to establish and breed there. In some lakes there is limited fishing allowed. The recovery of Aurora Trout is being guided by the Aurora Trout Recovery Strategy   Lake Nam 201  I think you need to do some reading unless they have fooled us all, which I find hard to believe"

471475,Terry,2010-06-01 01:29:00,14456,and here I thought you were on drugs and not sharing....LOL
471491,douG,2010-06-01 02:38:00,2693,I assure that as well.  Definitely.
471500,TDunn,2010-06-01 03:40:00,680,"12 lakes have Aurora trout present. Whirligig and Whitepine were the original two lakes with 10 other lakes now stocked with them, bringing the total to twelve. These lakes rotate open seasons(except the orginal two) as you will read on TJ's new site...  TDunn"
