It's a great spoon and it does have a cult following with brookie fishermen, but who would've expected that type of money?!?  Check your spoon/pier-chucking boxes for buried treasure!"

They work really well for Huron rainbow off the piers, but, for that money, I can buy an awfull lot of little Cleos that work almost, if not, as well."
471041,Syn,2010-05-30 19:51:00,519,Not surprised. Saw a guy drop 888 on a Bagleys rare blue crankbait on ebay link to listing  I'd dare to say some people are a bit  but I won't judge least I be judged too. lol
