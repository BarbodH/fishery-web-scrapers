471108,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-05-30 23:47:00,0,I've been trying to download pictures on Photobucket. Each picture takes 15 minutes to download and the second one keeps saying error.  I tried again and it took 15 minutes to get to 100% and its been at a 100% for the last 20 minutes also(still uploading).What happened to that site?

471121,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-05-31 00:18:00,0,I used the multiple upload and downloaded 8 pics faster than the two at one at a time. Maybe I am doing too many things at once on my computer. I guess its an issue on my side. Anyways I finally downloaded the pics and was able to post my report.
