471725,Billy Bob,2010-06-01 23:38:00,5865,yes but make sure your not too deep also
471795,siwash,2010-06-02 03:21:00,683,"Is 2 or 3"" ok? more, less?  Thanks.."
471796,irishfield,2010-06-02 03:27:00,26272,Not water line... bottom of transom.. or about an inch higher. Kicker isn't overly critical as it can't get the boat on plane anyhow!
471801,siwash,2010-06-02 03:43:00,683,You mean the cavator should be positioned at or below the bottom of the transom ?
471806,irishfield,2010-06-02 04:04:00,26272,I meant to type an inch higher... but like I said it's not critical anyhow as your kicker can never get you on plane! Hull speed at best so there'll always be water around the plate and prop!  http://www.marinepartsman.com/installing-an-outboard-on-your-boat.html
471827,dave524,2010-06-02 11:14:00,4508,"On the other hand , make sure you get it high enough that the kicker is totally clear when up on plane.  http://www.garelick.com/product.php?pnumber=71057#  I had one of these with an Eazy Steer , when I had my rig, there was plenty of adjustment to get it low in the water with a short shaft 9.9, but it was marginal to clear at full up, you definitely don't want it dragging under main power. Wish I had it mounted an inch higher at times."
