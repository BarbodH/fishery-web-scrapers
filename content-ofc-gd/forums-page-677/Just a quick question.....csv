471046,fishing n autograph,2010-05-30 19:57:00,2540,Jig head with buck tail...deer hair...and they come in various colours
471047,tb4me,2010-05-30 19:58:00,3295,Thats what I figured...Where do i find them.Id love to give them a try
471048,fishing n autograph,2010-05-30 19:59:00,2540,Most tackle shops carry them...they are also very easy to tie...just the initial cost can be a pain!

471054,vinnimon,2010-05-30 20:07:00,2593,Cheapto make considering what shops charge. Buck Tail=couple bucks Jig head= couple bucks Buck tail jig and a pickerel on the other end=priceless
471055,bigugli,2010-05-30 20:09:00,6138,Great for ripping through the weeds or for jigging from bottom. Most tackle shops carry some varieties. Look to some of your OFC members for some quality stuff. There is some great stuff being made by the members here.
