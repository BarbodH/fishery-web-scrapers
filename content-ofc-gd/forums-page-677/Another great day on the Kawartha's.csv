471100,Ron,2010-05-30 23:29:00,1683,"Worked all day Saturday but made up for it today. Hooked up with a buddy of mine in the wee hours and spent a fun filled day edumacating Walleye, all, day, long!  The bite wasn't quite as good as last weekend but needless to say, we weren't disappointed. Once buddy send off pictures, I will be sure to post them up here as he got his largest Walleye on an inland lake (other than Bay of Quinte). This little piggy hit a 1/4 oz bucktail in sparse weed over 8fow. She went 28"" long and would have easily weighed 10lbs.  In total we boated 37 Walleye, all on bucktails between 8 - 12 fow. It didn't matter where we went as long as we found a weed line we caught fish. I got broke off twice as well on decent size fish.  Cheers, Ron..."

471161,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-05-31 02:03:00,0,Sounds great! This seems to be a great year for pickerel and I will be using the bucktail jig a lot this year. That is my lure for the year. Last year was the jig and pig.  I would like to see some videos of guys rippin some bucktails. I seen one on Youtube from Rice lake but that's about it.  Looking forward to the pics.
