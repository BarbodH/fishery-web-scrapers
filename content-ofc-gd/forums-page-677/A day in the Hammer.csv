Anyhow, I'll be sitting in Hamilton a lot for the next while shuttling Judy to various appts. and clinics. Rather than pay to park and twiddle my thumbs, off to Bayfront we go.

You could really get into some interesting fish if you're going to be doing this often!  I've been reading a lot of really high quality fishing books recently if you get stuck inside some waiting rooms.  If you're interested, fire me a message and I'll toss you some titles.  Ryan"
