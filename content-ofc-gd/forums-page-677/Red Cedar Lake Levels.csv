470295,Gerry,2010-05-27 20:27:00,257,"I hear its very low. I'm going up in a couple of weeks so I'll report when I get back. Actually, wifey is up there visiting her mom and she is supposed to go to the lake on the weekend so I'll get a report from her."
470335,irishfield,2010-05-27 21:58:00,26272,Thistle is reported as 4 feet or more low Gerry.. and came up a bit last week. Can't see Red Cedar being much different. Temagami is still about 2 feet lower than usual FALL let down level.
470926,WeePished,2010-05-30 07:39:00,5, Any word on the Lake Levels from your wife? We are going up this coming weekend.
471220,Gerry,2010-05-31 09:26:00,257,"OK, finally got a report to give you.....wifey was having too much fun at the lake to call me! Anyway, the water levels have risen a bit but are still quite low. Can't get to some places on the lake and plenty of 'new' hazards. Apparantly, the fishing has been good."
471224,WeePished,2010-05-31 10:11:00,5," Thats great, I'll be heading up on Saturday for a week. I'll post something when I get back on the conditions and try and put some pics up.  Cheers!"
