471649,go5,2010-06-01 19:11:00,7,"Hi all,  So I recently took an interest in getting into fishing a little more seriously. I have dabbled for a couple years but looking to fish more.  I live in Mississauga so does anyone know of any good spots close or at least within 30 mins away. I would like to start going out in the mornings but have no real idea where to check out.  Thanks for any replies"

471670,BillsTheBassMan,2010-06-01 20:05:00,932,Good spots don't stay good for too long when people publicly post them.  Pick a river or lake near where you live.  Google the river and search it on these boards.  See what is in there to fish for etc and then research that fish.  OR (and call me crazy if you want to) you could just go fishing for in-season fish in a local-to-you body of water.  You'll get way more out of it by actually going and doing the fishing.

471700,go5,2010-06-01 21:42:00,7," I guess you would be right about publicly posting a spot. Was just looking for more general area in my area to start. Sometimes there are spots to enter/park, etc that I thought some might know that are not really secret.  And if you mean ""go fishing in a local to you body of water"" by what I think you mean then call me crazy but I thought I was clear in stating that is what I wanted to do  Thanks!"
