The Biteme Pointed team set out a 0400 to partake in the annual Aurora Bassmaster Pike derby on Lake Simcoe. It was a good turnout and frist prize was to be in the high 3 digits. We decided early in the week that we would change our stradegy from years past and head straight for the islands from Pasedena Marina. Weed growth was almost non existint sort of like Lake Ontario. But we soon discovered that the healthy  weeds were at 15 feet not altogether tall but there. so we set our mark at 15-20 feet and got down to business. we pounded the crap out of 50 miles of water and nothing so we decided on the old standby that has treated us fairly straight out of pasedina at 15 feet it is now 1300 and no fish. Time to switch to old fathful silver and copper williams spoons(doh should have done this from the start instead of crankbaiting the daylights out of everything). its now 1345 and we have to be weighed in by 1430 trolling along and an underwater spit comes up on the chart plotter from 20 feet to 15 feet bam of goes my rod on a copper spoon hit the mark button bring the fish in and we are off to the races go over the spot a few more times and 2 more fish within 5 min we are now in culling mode wahoo clocks ticking and not another fish to be had we get to weigh in thinking we might have a chance because we arent to bad at this and figure everyone is having the same issue anyway our total weight was 13.96 lbs enough to hold 3rd place we end up with 170.00 pays for the day and gas ....yeah baby we were off first by 8 oz should have stuffed a perch in one of the fish. So the best part of the day was kicking the buts of the guys in the fancy rocket boats but best of all decimating our buddies for another year.  The End Peter "
