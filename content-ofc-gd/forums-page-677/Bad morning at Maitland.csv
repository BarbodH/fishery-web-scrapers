Out there from 7-12 today , caught a total of 5 perch and 20 gobies, to be honest i think we caught the most fish out of the 20 ir so boats. I personally only saw two fish brought in this morning.  We ran down past Mohawk Island almost to Port Coborne and managed a few fish in the deep water 50-65 feet  There was about 15 boats out there with only a few fish being caught.  Bummer.  Darren"
