470996,danbouck,2010-05-30 16:56:00,4380,"4 of us heading down to the cottage Saturday to do some fishing and swimming. We met up at my house and 5:30, hit Timmies and were on our way. After 5 minutes we realized the first thing that we forget, batteries for the camera   Stopped at the gas station to pick some up and we were on our way again.  Music choice for the morning was anything heavy      We got to the boat and started getting everything loaded and ready to go. It was a BEAUTIFUL day out there!    We decided to head out 8 miles to a spot near pottahawk and get into some perch and pike. On the ride over we had the tunes once again cranked!        We got to the spot, drifted for a bit and then anchored when I got a few quick fish. This is when my day was almost ruined, Mark asked where my split shots were, I said ""In one of my boxes that you grabbed from the boathouse"". There was instant silence. ALL my tackle was left outside the boathouse   I pulled the anchor up and ran back the 8 miles and luckily it was still all there  We decided to stay in the inner bay after that and see what we could get. We ended up catching perch non stop. Mostly small ones but a few nice ones mixed in along with my PB World's Greatest Sport Fish and a OOS back.          We cruised over to Port Rowan early afternoon, docked the boat at the restaurant and sat down for some lunch. After that the plan was to hit the sandbar and play some football for the afternoon. Time flew by and before we knew it, it was 5PM    We stopped at Timmies again for some Iced Coffee and headed home    Even though I wore sunscreen I am once again recovering from a sunburn today.

471028,sutherh,2010-05-30 18:55:00,15,"I just posted something,attaching pics error message, uploads too big, I had to paste to Word...how do you upload all those good quality pictures ??"
471050,DRIFTER_016,2010-05-30 20:02:00,10439,"  To post pictures to the site...  1. Upload your pictures to your photobucket account. 2. Resize any pictures you'd like to post to a maximum of 400x600 pixels. Larger pictures distort the forum page and take longer to load. This can be done easily in Photobucket using the ""Edit"" options. 3. Open your photobucket album and find the photo you want to add. Place your cursor over the picture and a drop down menu will appear. Left click on ""IMG Code"". This will highlight the address. Now right click on the highlighted address so that ""copy"" shows.  Now left click on ""copy"" and the picture will be automatically copied to your ""clipboard"". 4. Go to your post you want to add it to on OFC, right click and ""paste"" the info. (if you copy the image code, it already has the ""img"" tags on the address and no further action is needed.)   For other photo storage sites that don't install the ""img"" codes onto your photo addresses, you'll have to add them manually.  The ""Add BBC tags:"" tool bar is at the top of every message dialog below the ""Subject"" dialog box and the ""Message icon"". In the lower row, click on the 2nd to the right of the smiley...the ""Insert Image"" icon(it looks like a small picture).  The command [ img][/img] will appear in your text message. Paste the address of your picture between the commands like this; [ img]paste your image location here [ /img] Be sure not to add any spaces or other characters.  Preview your post to be sure your picture is there and then choose post."
