Island Lake in Orangeville is close - you can fish for Pike, Perch, LM Bass a Crappie)."

470975,Toddyc20,2010-05-30 14:38:00,141,I lived less than 5 minutes from Hockley Valley Resort for most of my life and for me the best fishing in the area is Island Lake in Orangeville.  Lots of small pike and as of June 26th the bass bite is good also.  I`d go give Island Lake a shot and see if you can pull in a pike or two.
