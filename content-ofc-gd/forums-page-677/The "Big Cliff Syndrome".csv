Season opener, thought it would be easy, did some jigging with twister tails... no fish  last weekend,  tried the worm harness, jigs and rapalas spent a lot more time.  went deep went shallow, night and morning... no fish  this weekend i was determined!  Bought some real nice minnows, put in at least 8 hours of prime time fishing... no bloody fish   I want to say I have given up on these guys... but they taste so good!"
471232,Big Cliff,2010-05-31 11:03:00,6899,Were you fishing Sturgeon lake?
471389,addymark,2010-05-31 20:21:00,69,no I wasn't.  but I can't figure these guys out either.  I'm counting the days until i get one though... and it will probably be in the slot
471625,jimmer,2010-06-01 17:35:00,2730,"I have found it very tough this year on Pigeon Lake.  Some days you would think that there are no fish in the lake and I have lived on the lake for 26 years.  I have caught a few, but felt too guilty to keep any, so back they went. I have found myself going for panfish, just so I can catch something. Hang in there, it will happen, sooner or later!"
471884,Beans,2010-06-02 15:08:00,3339," Me too Jimmer...as a matter of fact I had Mark at the bait shop order me a 10 foot ""Wonderpole"" ($9) to use to play with the panfish...I had an old cheap fly reel that I taped on it to hold some line...a big bluegill makes you think you have hooked up with a decent bass...  I will soon be switching over to carp fishing...just bought my corn last week..."
471887,jimmer,2010-06-02 15:25:00,2730,"Hey Beans I went out last night and said I wasn't going to fish for panfish, even left that rod back at the dock.  I was determined to catch some walleye. I caught 3, but all were under the slot. They hit a beetle spin trolling in 5' - 6' of water.  Didn't see another boat fishing. Those bluegill are one awesome fight for a little fish, expecially the ones that are over 7""."
