471061,laszlo,2010-05-30 20:29:00,487,"Every year my wife Anna's younger brother Andrew and I do an annual camp out.  I worked Saturday until 3pm so Andrew hit the road first with most of the gear to set up prior to my arrival. Once I dashed out of work, I through in the new Black Keys CD called ""Brothers"" (how appropriate) that Andrew burned for me. What a wicked CD from start to finish. It set the mood right.  My Fishing Protege. It seems like just yesterday I taught him how to fish. That was 11 years ago now.     After a quick hello and high five we finished setting up camp.     Time was limited so we set off to hike and pursue some underwater critters. The water in the river was the lowest I've ever seen it in May. Only smaller fish remained in what are normally decent sized pools. The larger fish had dropped back to deeper habitat.          Like I said, nothing large but in the end we found:  Many Mooneye Walleye Rock Bass OOS Smallies Sucker (white and redhorse) Channel Cats  Once we got back to camp, light was fading along with our energy so re-fueling was a must. Pork Tenderloin Kabobs absolutely hit the spot!!!     Is there a better way of waking up then to the sounds of moving water and singing birds?     Till next time...  Laz"
