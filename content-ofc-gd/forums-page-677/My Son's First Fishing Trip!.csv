471697,Joey,2010-06-01 21:37:00,9122,What wonderful pictures Aaron.  Great report.  Joey
471754,bpsbassman,2010-06-02 01:04:00,941, The first of many!! Thanks for a great post Aaron.
471824,fishhunter,2010-06-02 10:54:00,604,Great pics! Nothing better then a day on the water with the family.
471182,Aaron Shirley,2010-05-31 02:35:00,655,"I took my wife Kristi and one-year-old son Brayden out fishing to the Niagara River recently. This was my son's 1st fishing trip, and Kristi and I were excited. We planned on being out there for about 20 minutes to an hour, whatever he could handle. Well, we were out there just over two hours and had a riot with Brayden.  At first, he kept trying to climb over the side of the boat and into the river, so we didn't think we would last long. We took turns with him playing with the minnows in the livewell  He was happy catching minnows and throwing them back in the well. Every once in a while when he got bored, we'd go for a boat ride, and he loved going fast!  I got one jumbo perch, and when Brayden saw me pull it in, he dropped his tigger rod like a hot potato and ran for my 10-foot rod  When we left to go home, he was asleep by the time we hit the road  It was a beautiful day out, and the best day of my life!  Here are some pics from the day            Good fishing!  Aaron"
471183,irishfield,2010-05-31 02:38:00,26272,"Great stuff Aaron, first it was Tony and now it's  your own boy!  ... how many did he eat??"
471184,Musky or Specks,2010-05-31 02:39:00,2710,Awesome Unforgettable moment for you for sure
471186,asdve23rveavwa,2010-05-31 02:42:00,2690,"Awesome, Aaron...that is what it is all about, passing it on to future generations!!  I don't have any children of my own, but, Juli's three boys (ten year old twins, and an eleven year old) all come out fishing with us every once in awhile.  They are at that critical age where you don't want to force them to do it.  I find that talking about fishing, showing them photos of our fishing trips, or watching the odd fishing show will get them pumped and asking ""when are we going fishing again, Frank?"" Nice photos as usual!!"
471198,fishing,2010-05-31 03:13:00,167,Nice and cool pictures.
471228,solopaddler,2010-05-31 10:21:00,8605,Great to see Aaron!
471230,Tarzan's Jane,2010-05-31 10:42:00,1183,Little Brayden looks like a natural - appears he has done this before - love the way he's sitting there so relaxed in the first pic.  Great day for you and your family for sure
471233,splashhopper,2010-05-31 11:08:00,2931,great pics
471234,Spiel,2010-05-31 11:20:00,9065,"  Smart (cute) little boy you have there Aaron, best get him some quality gear before he starts taking yours.  "
471236,danbouck,2010-05-31 11:25:00,4380,Awesome
471240,Aaron Shirley,2010-05-31 11:50:00,655,"Irishfield LMAO. We thought for sure he would try eating the minnows, especially since he's teething, but he never tried once! He was just content trying to scoop them out, hold them and put them back in the well  Thx everyone, definitely a proud dad"
471242,bigugli,2010-05-31 12:01:00,6138,You'll be even prouder when he comes up to you and says 'let's play hookie and go fishing Dad'.
471245,Rich Clemens,2010-05-31 12:04:00,3131,"Great show Aaron.   From the looks of the pics, the young lad is gonna be giving Dad a run for his money.   These are the photos you'll treasure for a lifetime.   Thanks for sharing."
471253,Roy,2010-05-31 12:28:00,13728,"Kodak moments for sure, Aaron. Thanks for sharing."
471256,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-05-31 12:38:00,0,"Those are what great memories are made of, and the best thing of all is that there are many, many more to come!"
471266,Handlebarz,2010-05-31 13:13:00,3790,That is awesome for sure. I love watching the kids playing with the live well that thing is better then any TV set out there. Both our kids have been in the boat since they were born bouncing around in the car seat and it sure did pay off as they both love fishing. I guess you boy is like most of our kids on the site with not much choice but to get out with the family and learn to love teh out doors I can wait to see the reports wand watch him grow on the boat.  Cheers Mike
471271,Grimace,2010-05-31 13:45:00,2020,Awesome.  I plan on doing the same thing with my 1 year old very soon.
471280,rock34,2010-05-31 14:08:00,215,"My daughter is almost 5 months....I am always thinking about where her first fishing trip should be.  Thanks for sharing, looks like the little guy had a great time!"
471293,David Chong,2010-05-31 14:57:00,836,"Awesome! Aaron get'em hooked while they're young! Cheers, Dave"
471294,I'mHooked,2010-05-31 15:03:00,525, I thought Aaron was more of a Fugi guy?
471304,BillsTheBassMan,2010-05-31 15:45:00,932,"Looks like a great day on the water and a great first outing for your son.  Better get started on his first tackle box, if only just to keep your $14 crankbaits safe."
471399,Blue Lk,2010-05-31 21:20:00,337,"That's GREAT,the idea is,take them out when they are young,& hopefully,they will take you out when you are old."
471463,msp,2010-06-01 00:42:00,1336,Looks like fun. Getting children onto fish is ALMOST as fun as getting them yourself. He looks just like you.
471529,douG,2010-06-01 11:44:00,2693,"Well done, Aaron.  The look of wonder on his face is priceless."
471540,MJL,2010-06-01 12:40:00,2427,Nicely done Aaron
