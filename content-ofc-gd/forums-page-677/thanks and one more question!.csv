471674,Big Cliff,2010-06-01 20:10:00,6899," Can't help you with Grey Owl camp but I have heard some good things about them.  The trip I had up there a few years back was fantastic but we roughed it and just camped. I will say one thing, I was glad I had someone with me that knew the lake because there are some rocks in places you would never expect rocks!"
471675,solopaddler,2010-06-01 20:22:00,8605,"Have heard nothing but good things about the camp. Fishing on Bisco is okay...not great.  I assume you're looking at this as a cheaper alternative to a fly in?  IMO Ramsey lake which feeds Bisco is a much better walleye lake.  There's one camp on Ramsey. Personally I've never stayed at it, only camped on the lake, but have heard good things:  http://www.rayscamps.com/  In the same region and imo opinion a much better alternative to either is Wenebegon Lake west of Ramsey.  Five Mile lake lodge has a remote outpost on this generally inaccessable lake.  They take you in with atv's to a boat cache where you then motor to their outpost camp. Very remote, very good walleye fishing.  http://www.fivemilelake.com/chapleau-outpost-camps.htm"
