470462,duker,2010-05-28 11:46:00,3,Does anyone own a Eagle Cuda 350 S Combo fish finder GPS unit? or another eagle GPS unit that comes preloaded with there world map.  I am trying to find out the coverage of Canadian lakes. Obviously it would benefit from having an SD slot for additional maps but if the built in map is half descent I can't beat the price of the Cuda 350.

471348,John,2010-05-31 17:39:00,2956,Do you want to spend $500 or $2500?
471914,duker,2010-06-02 16:40:00,3, I am looking to spend under $300. I have looked at the Eagle Cuda 350 Combo - not sure at the detail level of map in Canada? Also not able to upload additional maps and I have been looking at the Humminbird 365i Combo - $100 more but come with SD slot for additional maps.
