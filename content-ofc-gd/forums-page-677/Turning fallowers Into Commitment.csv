470805,Fishing 24/7,2010-05-29 21:38:00,709,Lately Theres been to much Fallowers and not enough Commitment.   Pikes are interested in my lures......... they show them selfs But they dont hit.   have any of you have this probleme.  Well got a great tip from one of my Fishing buddy. He told me.  Hey Idiot.... Stop using the same OL' same OL' and start switching up your style .  So i finaly listen........SWIMBAITS he said.  Yeah these things    Sweet. lets try them then.  BANG !!! to my surprise... fish ON!    This rocket didnt hesitate one second to Destroy this lure.  with a stop and go action. there was no stopping them.    This way little fellow.    And back you go.   Next fish was One of the best trike i had in years.  Cast in the bait as far as i can...... Two aggresive twitches and BANG! had him.... He T-BONED the lure .    When i saw this thing comming towards the boat i knew i had something bigger.    Sadly this gurl was a D.O.S  Death On Strike. Ripped 3 of her gils while setting the hook and died within 3-4 minutes.    GOOD NEWS. i have 10 people waitting in line to eat her... and im first in this line-up!      comming up to a sweet pike bay.  i noticed the wind picking up and that means that the pike are getting active.  Cast the swimbait deep in the bay and i feel a soft ...pick!  not a hard hit but i set the hook anyways.  This fish was heavy...... it kept 15 FOW and didnt want to show her self.  Well she lost the fight.    picking her up.    classic hold.    released the unharmed BRUTE!  Wanna know what happened to the lockness monster thats was bleeding?    She dont fit in DA sink thats what.  was the best 3 houres of fishing this year.  stephanie got a tan .    and i got my BEAST!

470839,spincast,2010-05-29 23:02:00,3279,"nice. Those are hot for bass too, got some lunkers on them in the weeds. Have to see how Long Point pike like them tomorrow!"
470842,solopaddler,2010-05-29 23:18:00,8605,"Beautiful pike dude, and good call on the swimbaits. I've got a box full ready to take north with me in a couple of weeks."
470853,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-05-30 00:06:00,0,"Very impressive pike. Did you take a measurement and weigh her when you got home? I've heard really good things about swim baits, but I also think the stop and go did the trick. When you have followers that are not committing? It means you are working your lure too fast. Try varying your retrieves. Speed up, slow down, stop, ect... Mix it up!  Anyways, thanks for sharing!"
470858,Fishing 24/7,2010-05-30 00:33:00,709,  buddy dont forget to hit the shallow sand bars.   let the swim bait sink and give it a couple of POPS!  the big gun love that!   looks like a freashly dying bait fish.
470884,msp,2010-05-30 01:42:00,1336,Great pike. Nice pics and story !
470927,Fishing 24/7,2010-05-30 08:09:00,709,  No johnny no weight and no mesurements. on the last one because i didnt bring her home. i brought the bleeder home the 9 lbs pike.  thanks for the tip bud!
470928,Rich Clemens,2010-05-30 09:26:00,3131,"I've been trying the swim-baits a little more, just as you said, to mix things up a bit.  Didn't do too bad last year with Pike.  Looks like you've gotten off to great start this year.  Congrats on the nice fish."
