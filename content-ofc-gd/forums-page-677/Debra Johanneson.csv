471056,scuro2,2010-05-30 20:09:00,904, I believe she married Kevin Geary of Anglers Kingdom. Kevin posts on this forum and is a knowledgeable guy. http://www.anglerskingdom.com/aboutkevin.html
471368,capt bruce,2010-05-31 18:57:00,820,"Kevin posts here some times I believe hes the guy who would know .Check out the Nungesser Lake posts and ask him .I remember he was her camera guy and the rumors were (are) that they ran off into the northern sunset to live the good life , as I said ask Kevin .."
471394,scuro2,2010-05-31 21:02:00,904,This is getting interesting. I thought it was Kevin who did the TV show and produced a video. Never knew he was the cameraman for Debra. Perhaps he caught a break after working for Debra!
