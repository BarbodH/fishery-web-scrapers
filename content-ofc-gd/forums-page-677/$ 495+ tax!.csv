470801,canadadude,2010-05-29 21:35:00,769,"I didn't relise that motor had 3 carbs,so if you clean them and put in new carb kits your looking at $120-$150 just in parts,plus $40 for a head gasket so perhaps the $500 price tag isn't that far off  If the mechanic is good he's going to reassemble the carburators with a carb kit,your looking at close to $200 in parts alone  Parts have gone up substantally since I've played around with outboards"

He went through everything with me and even showed me the ""bad"" parts. They are professional, that I will give them.  they also checked and adjusted things that I did not mention.. small items, but nevertheless, they were done. So, I feel better about it now and I am sure that the motor is going to work wonderfully for me from now on. He said the compression was excellent, among other things.  there's a bunch of stuff on the invoice ""report"" and I will dig it up and post anyhting I have questions about.  Thanks folks for all the input!"

470895,Billy Bob,2010-05-30 02:05:00,5865, I don't know if that's true or not and it very much may be true....I can only speak from experience and I have never used fuel stabilizer in my gas until I am ready to put the boat away for the winter...my motor is a 1985 50 hp Johnson VRO outboard...it runs just like the day I bought it but it is going in Friday to see if they can find the internal leak on my Tilt/Trim system...other than that I had one impeller replaced about 5-6 years ago. I guess maybe I'm lucky because I have heard many here don't like the OMC VRO systems but I love it.

470723,SlowPoke,2010-05-29 13:32:00,2984," If that is food for thought, you're dining on ignorance.  So tell us Mr. IT Manager; how long would it take you to hook up a boat trailer, bring it in to the shop, diagnose the problem, flush the system, rebuild the carbS (obviously you're aware there is more than one), set the carbs, replace the head gasket, run it in a test tank, hook up the trailer and pull it out of the shop?"
470724,BillM,2010-05-29 13:36:00,17367," You forgot to mention that you need to be a certified mechanic to do all those things.  Or did you completely miss my point and go off on some misinformed rant?  (I'm thinking #2)  We can poodle back and forth about this all day, you are entitled to your opinion, I'm entitled to mine.  How about we just leave it at?"
470726,SlowPoke,2010-05-29 13:43:00,2984," With a new boat motor and water seperator, I don't think you would benefit much by adding Seafoam (prob $20/ fillup) at this point. Maybe once or twice a season. You will actually see a difference on an older motor. Carbon deposits leaving the exhaust, a little extra smoke initially and nearly instant improvment in throttle response.  As it was explained to me, Seafoam as a stabilizer works differently than other stabilizers. It is claimed to mix with the fuel and absorb moisture while others are said to prevent moisture from mixing with your fuel. The idea being moisture is absorbed by Seafoam, dissapated, becomes combustable and leaves your fuel system entirely."
470727,SlowPoke,2010-05-29 13:59:00,2984," The OP clearly states that he is not mechanicly inclined and Cliff's response was to him, not you. I don't think Cliff would have responded to Bernie (a certified automotive tech) that he MUST take his outboard to a certified marine tech. In short, Cliff's post illustrated why the job costs $500. He's not saying it can't be done cheaper by a guy that owns a $90 wrench set and lots of spare time. You insulted Cliff and others with your post."
470729,BillM,2010-05-29 14:01:00,17367," I guess you and I read things differently.  My apologies to Cliff and anyone else that took offense to my original reply.  That still doesn't change my stance on the subject, but again that's my opinion."

470746,Guest gbfisher,2010-05-29 15:53:00,0,At least now it is fixed and guaranteed. I'm not sure about the rest of you but my time is worth lots to me. I could fix it but I wouldn't. I'd rather give it to someone who knows how to do it all right. Klaus was a good call for sure. Good work costs money.
470758,Big Cliff,2010-05-29 17:48:00,6899," No need to use both Lew. Stabil is an excellent product and so is Seafoam. I use Stabil in all my equipment here at home, every can of gas that I bring home gets treated right away. It is less expensive than Seafoam but if you use it regularly you won't need the Seafoam.  That being said, Seafoam does work slightly differently with reguard to water. If you want to see the difference, pour a bit of Stabil into a glass jar and let it sit outside on a humid day. It won't take long before you will see water sitting in the bottom of the jar. Try the same thing with seafoam, you won't see the water seperation like you will with Stabil.  The best defense; keep your tanks filled, less hot humid air in the tank means less water to be absorbed or condensed when the tank cools. Use a good quality stabilizer which you are already doing, (that is why you aren't having any problems!"

What is the proper setting for the needle jets on those carbs and how long do you think that two stroke will run if he adjusts the carbs too lean!!! Long enough to get him out into the middle of the lake!!!!

Theirs a couple of things you have to remember about all diagnostic. Find the problem. Is their anything related to the problem. Never let yourself get stuck in the box.

Now I have read Big Cliff's other postings on here and at other places, I understand he is looked upon as a stand up Guy. He might very well be, however I have never nor will I ever single anyone out and slam them like that. No one on here knows me personally but I assure you my post to the OP was with only good intentions. I did not say that he was being ripped off, I said he needs a manual and that a lean condition of a bad carburetor can and will destroy his motor. I do not feel as if I gave bad information. I use the same name on other boards I belong too, all you have to do is google my user name and check. I ask a lot of questions, and contribute when I can.  I will admit I am certainly no marine mechanic, I have and do ask questions about repairs but I also learn as I go. I for one do not have the luxury of taking my stuff to a shop for repairs, I can not afford it. I do not believe though that it should prevent me from being able to enjoy fishing from my boat because I have to do the repairs my self. I will be 42 years old in two months and have been turning my own wrenches since I was about 10 years old, from motorcycles to bulldozers. But again I admit I am no pro and still have to ask questions, and I am not afraid to admit to it when I don't know much about some things.  Jeff"
470791,Bernie,2010-05-29 20:35:00,3190,"Cliff, your advise given here has been spot on. The 3 carbs on the 70 take some time to disassemble, clean, adjust and reassemble with the linkages needing to be properly set. This takes some time and experience is necessary to do the job properly. While the head gasket appears to be a simple job , an experienced tech will also be able to spot other possible issues when the head is off such as cylinder scores, warped head, cracks etc. Also as has been mentioned is the requirement of a torque wrench, specifications and pattern. 4 hrs? I bet it takes at least that long to do the job properly. This is a fair estimate. No ripoff there. Some guys do have some mechanical skills that are not in the trade and are capable of doing some home repairs. In my shop we see evidence of botched repairs often. I can understand the reason why fellas try to save themselves a few bucks but often it just ends up costing more."

Any decent mechanic could have done the work in 2.5 hrs shop time at $90.00 an hour. Changing the head gasket is realativly easy and cleaning the carburator is no big deal on these motors. For $500 you could have bolted on a brand new carb, a brand new head and a new gasket and pulling the fly weel off these motors is easy, I don't understand another $400 and change.

Does that carb have a gasket? Is the guy going to rebuild carb with kit? or just clean it up?

In addition to learing about the motors you can also bring your motor in an work on it there; this is a great benefit because buying special tools for a repair costs more than taking it to a mechanic.
470651,T Fisher,2010-05-29 01:37:00,139,A headgasket is no big deal just make sure you torq to specs.  rebulding a carb is no big deal they are gummed with varnish from old gas. pull the bowls off spray them with a good qulity carb cleaner spraying librily in and out of the carbs use air to blow dry.

470684,Jonny,2010-05-29 04:23:00,1380,"An outboard motor is a piece of recreational equipment. There's always a premium on fixing those.  If you treat your equipment well, and with a bit of luck, you can run an outboard for decades without a major repair. If you buy a used outboard, you're paying a lot less, but you're also taking a chance on how well the motor was treated by the previous owner. A lot of expensive things can eventually go wrong without proper maintenance and storage.  Old motors aren't any cheaper to fix than newer ones. What the motor is worth in good running condition has no bearing on what it costs to fix it when something goes wrong.  The best insurance policy for an old motor? A 2 or 3 HP kicker to get you back to the dock or the landing.  I've gone through the financial hit of fixing an old motor. It's part of the price of admission, I figure."

The only time I ever had a problem with it was on an older engine, the only thing sealing the rings was a carbon build up. Cleaned out the carbon, lost some compression LOL. I buy it by the case and always use it in my shop but you should follow the Mfg. instructions. Here is a link that will tell you how, why, and where to use it. Seafoam"

For example, should I use synthetic oil, premium gas, etc...  Also, I have changed the lower unit oil, the plugs and usually the fuel filter , too,  every year on previously owned motors. These are the only things I have done without the assistance of a mechanic!  Anything else?  Thanks!!"
470699,siwash,2010-05-29 10:41:00,683,"Just looked at Cliff's Seafoam link. Wow, looks great! Maybe I should invest in the stuff? I want to take some preventative measures.

470705,Big Cliff,2010-05-29 11:13:00,6899," It sounds like you are doing most of the right things!  I'm not sure if CTC has it, I buy it at NAPA Auto parts. Use the fuel treatment and follow their recomendations. You will eliminate most fuel related problems. I do believe in using a good quality oil and synthetics do have their virtues but as long as you make sure what you are using is good quality you should be fine especially in a two stroke. In a 4 stroke after the first oil change, I do believe there is some advantage to using a synthetic. Not that you have to! Premium gas should only be used in engines that are desigined to run on premium gas.  I wish you were closer to me, I work out of my garage every Saturday up until about noon and would be happy to try to help you learn the proper way to do some of the things. Mind you, I'd make you get your hands dirty LOL. Unfortunatly I am so back logged right now that I am about 2 months behind but if you want to come and help out on Saturday mornings I'll teach you how to do whatever I happen to be working on that day.  Oh, and BTW, (Just to clarify things) I have never charged an OFNr a cent for labour on anything I have done for them and I'm sure not trying to drum up extra business, I have way more than I can handle now. Saddly, I have had to turn some work away just because I am so back logged and I am not going to work 7 days a week anymore.

Perhaps the amounts in a few of the boxes on my T4 slip?  My point is this..  Swapping out a headgasket isn't complicated, either is cleaning a carburetor.  If you have a bit of mechanic ability and some patience you could easily tackle it.  Now, what I do have a problem with is someone coming on here and trying to 'scare' the poor guy into taking it in somewhere to get replaced.  Perhaps I misunderstood Cliffs reply, but I don't think so.  I guess I've pissed off a lot of VW and GMC mechanics by doing all my own work on my car or truck.  I don't remember taking that $7000 course or buying $10,000 worth of tools to do it either...  Food for thought."

I've got a gas/water seperator installed in my boat with a 10 micron filter that'll be changed every season so hopefully that, along with the fuel treatments will keep things purring for many years to come.  Yup, times & technology are constantly changing but I don't know if that's always a good thing."
470555,siwash,2010-05-28 20:12:00,683,"Boy, was that a kick in the ass... just got the quote on my motor ""repair"" for my 70 HP 1982 Evinrunde   gonna cost me well over $500 with tax.  Klaus Marine said the top carb was ""gummed up"" (dirty, old fuel?) and the cylinder head gasket needed replacement. Probably $80 parts.  I need to buy a manual and learn how to do this stuff myself. I just find it intimidating... but $500 is more intimidating.  I only paid $1900 for the entire boat package.  Damn!"
470556,canadadude,2010-05-28 20:15:00,769,"OUCH,thats robbery"
470557,solopaddler,2010-05-28 20:15:00,8605,Sounds like a lot.  A can of Seafoam would've cleaned up the carb...
470559,wvmedic,2010-05-28 20:21:00,144,"swordfish, if you have any mechanical skill cleaning and rebuilding the carbs is not that hard, the head gasket really isn't either.  I admit it is a little intimidating at first but once you tear into it it isn't that bad.  There was a post on here about a year or so ago that gave an web address to a library that had free manuals for download, I'll see if I can find it.  Jeff"
470561,Big Cliff,2010-05-28 20:26:00,6899," Wouldn't have done much to help the head gasket though. Might have even made it worse. Maybe now you will start to use fuel stabilizer in every tank, won't repair the head gasket but it will prevent fuel problems in the future."
470564,wvmedic,2010-05-28 20:34:00,144,"I couldn't find it on my laptop, it might be on the home computer.  Fuel stabilizer is you're friend, with a gummed up carb that cylinder would run lean. Running a two stroke motor lean means that the motor is not being properly lubricated, because the oil, gas mix is what lubricates the entire motor.  Jeff"
470568,SRT8 smoker craft,2010-05-28 20:58:00,1107,http://forums.iboats.com/ has a lot of manuals to DL I think it's under the adults only sticky and its only titled that way to get your attention its a FAQ section great site lots of helpful people  http://forums.iboats.com/showthread.php?t=301361  I think this is were the rude manuals are.
470571,solopaddler,2010-05-28 21:05:00,8605," Doubt it would make it worse, plus it's an easy fix if does work.  Beyond dumping a can in the gas and running it through the motor, you can pop off the plugs and pour some into the cylinder heads to soak overnight."
470572,Terry,2010-05-28 21:12:00,14456,I am with Cliff on this one  if you put stuff in to clean things out  gunk and small particles around the gasket will be removed and the gasket will leak more   remove the carb and clean it..
470574,siwash,2010-05-28 21:30:00,683, Fuel stabilizer eh? I thought that was for fuel that sits over the winter?
470575,siwash,2010-05-28 21:32:00,683,"  I am not mechanically inclined... i don't even know what these things do... I will admit, I am an idiot when it comes to this stuff. Guys like me end up getting ripped off, I guess...   I would like to learn..."
470576,siwash,2010-05-28 21:36:00,683,"Thanks guys.. like I said previously, I am a mechanical idiot. I need to learn what the purpose of these parts is.. I am going to locate a manual then educate myself via the web. I am so mad that I had to spend $500... especially since I don't have a lot of money.  ;("
470577,siwash,2010-05-28 21:36:00,683,And is it possible that the job took 4+ hours???
470579,aplumma,2010-05-28 21:50:00,6896," I don't feel like you are being ripped off. I am not a marine mechanic but I am in a similar field....plumbing. You have to look at the whole picture...Their is a lot of overhead in the shop and the tools and parts on hand. You figure if the job takes just 4 hours which is a reasonable amount of time for a diagnostic plus work and test time. That is $100.oo per hour to pay the mechanic,secretary,shop overhead,rent,accountant and taxes that's before the profit is realized. The mechanic has a lot of time invested in his education and his tools he deserves to make a good wage for his efforts. I bet once you understand what they had to do to make your motor run correctly you will feel better with the price.   Art"
470580,BillM,2010-05-28 21:51:00,17367,"Man, a headgasket on that motor isn't a complicated thing..   You might want to try it someday, it's not as intimidating as it sounds."
470585,Big Cliff,2010-05-28 21:59:00,6899," You are right, neither job is hard. Having a torque wrench and knowing how to use it properly when you have changed the head gasket takes a little more knowledge and why bother to see if the head is warped or not, stick a new head gasket in it and have at it.  Or you can just use a ratchet and socket and tighten them to 230""lbs (or what ever that feels like; snug and what the heck a quarter turn more just for good luck)Knowing the proper bolt tightening pattern; that you should be able to find in the manual.  Cleaning the gunk out of the carb is easy, knowing what you are looking at when you have the carb apart and checking for a leaking needle valve or seats; float bowl leaks(I guess I shouldn't have spent over $1000.00 on carb tools so I can test and adjust them properly)making sure you put everything back properly and adjusting the jets, what the heck, just tighten them up and back them out a couple of turns and see what happens, who needs a tachometer to tune it properly, adjust until it sounds right!  I'm not trying to make it sound like rocket science but some of the most expensive repairs I have ever had to do were because someone thought ""it's just a simple fix, I can do it myself and save some money""!  Those are the ones where I have to go back to square one and try to figure out what they did to it (and most of the time they won't admit to doing anything) but the needle valve seat just jumped out and turned it self upside down and fell right back into place. (Now that is the first thing I would look for if there was a carb problem   Then they get upset because it took me 4 hours to do a job that I could have done in 2 if they hadn't played with it first.  I don't know if you realize it but a marine mechanic has to serve 5000 hours of apprenticeship, (and his first 2000-3000 were probably at slightly above minimum wage) go to school for 24 weeks spaced over 3 years and he can't have a mark on any test below 70% and then write a test for his license, a 120 questions on everything from electronics, to pnumatics, to gear ratios and then some. again, the minimum pass is 70%.  By then he probably has a bare minimum of $7000.00 (and most have a lot more than that) invested in tools.  Oh what the heck for those that want to, good luck on fixing it yourself! The next repair might be a lot more than $500.00.  I'm going fishing!"
470587,siwash,2010-05-28 22:00:00,683,"The thing is, I wouldn't have been able to ""diagnose"" the issues with the motor...  So, either way, he would have charged me a $100 just to look at it... perhaps I should have taken it home instead of leaving it there.  I swear I will not take it to a mechanic again. I am determined to figure this stuff out on my own in the future...  On a ""side note"" Klaus just sent me an email. This is what he said:  We found that the engineâs charging system isnât working.  You have two options:  Install a new stator under the flywheel.  This will cost you $421.03 Make sure the extra battery you have is fully charged and good to go."
470590,SlowPoke,2010-05-28 22:09:00,2984,"It costs what it costs, unfortunatly. The sting in this repair bill is that the motor is only worth $500 in great condition. Had it been a 2002 motor it would probably have cost the same but hurt a lot less. You're not going to get back on the water any cheaper and you will soon forget the repair bill. The labour rate doesn't seem outrageous at four hours"
470591,SlowPoke,2010-05-28 22:12:00,2984," Ouch!!! That's just rubbing salt in the wound! That's about what I paid for the stator on my 75 Mariner. The flywheel is pressed on, not an easy DIY job without the tools."
470592,Big Cliff,2010-05-28 22:12:00,6899, Fuel starts to degrade within 30 days since they started adding ethanol to it.
470593,BillM,2010-05-28 22:19:00,17367, Typical mechanics response.  What a joke.
470598,SlowPoke,2010-05-28 22:33:00,2984,"We obviously have a different sense of humour because I didn't find his response very funny. In fact, part of the problems with trades these days is the time and monetary investment for education. Many of today's youth evaluate the cost of education and time investment to achieve a goal and move on to unskilled labour just to maintain a SUBstandard living. So what do you do for a living?"
470611,spincast,2010-05-28 23:29:00,3279,"IF you are the kind of guy who can assemble anything mechanical from a bicycle to a barbeque or lawnmower motor first time without looking at a manual and have no springs or screws left over at then end, some of what you have read is correct. I  taught myself to rebuild motorcyle  engines with manuals and a call or two when it came to setting up the cams or something else unique.  IF you are always looking at that screw or bolt after you put it together - pay someone. Because you will eventually"
470615,smally21,2010-05-28 23:40:00,993,who would of thought a 40 year old motor would require expensive repairs?
470619,wvmedic,2010-05-29 00:01:00,144,"Wow Big Clif, didn't mean to step on you're toes. I guess trying to help someone with not so much cash get there boat running so they can get back on the water is an issue. It's not like folks haven't been working on there own stuff for years with no problem, heck some folks can even fabricate there own stuff in there garage.   It isn't like I was telling him to tear apart his lower unit where precise tolerances is a absolute must. I wouldn't want to tear into my lower unit.  Oh well I'm going to stop now, sorry for posting.  Have a good evening.  Jeff"
