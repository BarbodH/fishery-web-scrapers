I had rigged up some 10 inch chubs with a hook through the bottom lip and a stinger hook between the lower fin and the tail.  This has worked fine for the others I caught except for these two  I even got one of the big buggers untangled  from some exposed tree roots and was dragging him on to the muddy bank. ( no net with me )   How long should I play these things out for... it seems they play possum right to the shore and then KABOOM... they are outa here.... I don;t want to over work them either. Any suggestions?  Splashhopper"

471208,Syn,2010-05-31 03:41:00,519,"Make sure hooks are sharpened.  Also fishing live bait with lip hook and treble (or 2 hook) rear hook (higher rate of deeply hooked fish using this method from what I have experienced) noticed that I have to wait a while longer before I set the hook because the pike/muskie takes its time to reposition the sucker so that it can swallow it head first. If it ""T boned"" it the hooks may not be in a good position for hook setting. All I can suggest is wait a bit longer before you set the hook."
471223,splashhopper,2010-05-31 09:56:00,2931,"  Interesting that you say they ""re-position"" the suckers when using this set up...  I was wondering why I lost FOUR suckers but only saw some light twitching on the float and didn't see it go under at all"
471255,Syn,2010-05-31 12:34:00,519," So many ways to rig live bait, from trebles in different places to using a bit of thick elastic over the front lip hook, to rigging the chub hooks backwards so that when the chub is in head first position ready to be swallowed the hooks are in the best position for hook setting. Also depends if you are using a bobber or not like the Europeans like to do.    http://muskie.outdoorsfirst.com/watch.asp?id=790"
