893257,johnnyb,2015-01-21 02:15:00,3413,Im 0 for 2 out there this season..... just don't know what I'm doing wrong.  Ah well....figuring it out is half the fun.  Now....you said crankbaits.  Care to explain?
893263,johnnyb,2015-01-21 02:40:00,3413,Just realized you likely meant lipless rattling cranks....duh...
893265,manitoubass2,2015-01-21 02:44:00,11391,Yeah im sure thats what he meant  I did see somewhere that you can now get weighted clips to vertically fish crank baits through the ice. That would be pretty cool if it worked good.  Maybe in an In Fisherman or something?

Not exactly what you were talking about, but just found these after readin a KVD article, I thought it was a pretty cool idea.  He also talked about clip-on weights that attach to the split ring. http://www.basspro.com/STORM-Suspendots-and-SuspenStrips-Weights/product/202/"
893332,AKRISONER,2015-01-21 16:29:00,5558,"Anyone have any idea what lake this is at all? Seems like a big one, so it cant be ""too secret""  for a second i thought parry sound but then quickly realized you cant keep any fish until february, and even then its only 1."
893333,BillM,2015-01-21 16:32:00,17367,"Uh, that's Simcoe.  No secret."
893334,misfish,2015-01-21 16:37:00,29133,Nice Bill. Not like we don't have enough towns and villages out there already.          :tease:
893335,BillM,2015-01-21 16:44:00,17367,"Nice Bill. Not like we don't have enough towns and villages out there already.          :tease:  Let's rename the lake, maybe the guys from the city won't figure it out"
893337,AKRISONER,2015-01-21 16:52:00,5558,"lol im gonna walk out on simcoe blindly,  with no clue what i am doing what so ever...im sure it will work out perfectly for me.  I am just waiting for Bill to treck across parry sound harbour to give me the all clear  Killer job though guys"
893342,BillM,2015-01-21 17:41:00,17367,"Simcoe isn't very hard to figure out especially if you're fishing Kemp.  Find an access point, pop a few holes, look for some fish and there ya go."
