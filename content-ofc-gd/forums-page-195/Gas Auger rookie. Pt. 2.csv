No bolt that joins the auger to the engine. Spent the day scavenging other people' holes ( no jokes please). Got home. Discovered bolt recessed in shaft of auger. Had it the whole time. Felt really stupid. The End."

893249,chris.brock,2015-01-21 01:59:00,4053,story of my life Mr T  you've got a good campfire/ drinking story for your buddies anyway  scavenging other people's holes isn't cool (sorry   )
893252,Terry,2015-01-21 02:05:00,14456,sounds like me life is always an adventure
893274,porkpie,2015-01-21 04:09:00,2521,"Get yourself a couple of hitch pins at the home hardware in town.  Make sure they are the correct diameter and length, then slap one on the auger, and toss an extra in your tackle bag.  Makes a great quick connect, and you always have a spare!"
893285,wormdunker,2015-01-21 07:15:00,1711,Good advice Porkpie.  Thanx
893305,jayess,2015-01-21 14:57:00,187,+1 to the above recommendation... but also grease up the shaft for easy removal of the auger head if you're taking it off for easy travel.
