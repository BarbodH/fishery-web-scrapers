891211,johnnyb,2015-01-09 02:04:00,3413,"Hey guys...been a super long time since I've posted here....sems Facebook is where I chat with my fishing buddies.  Anyway, hope you're doing well....got a question for you east-enders.  I have a newly addicted fishing buddy who wants to try ice fishing for the first time.  I dont don't want to drag him out on a 2 hour drive to go freeze all day amd have him decide he doesnt like it.  I'll wait till he's hooked on hardwater for that lol.  He lives right by Frenchmans,  and I kow it's frozen, as I'm seeing reports this week. I figure we can go out for a bit, show him what the deal is, hook a few pike and perch. My question is,  where do I park down there? Any help is much appreciated....tight lines!"
891228,Acountdeleted,2015-01-09 02:38:00,2562,"If you go to south shoal road there should be ample parking but I will set out this warning PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE wait another week or so. With the bay flowing into lake O, the iffy weather and the channel dredging over the past 2 years the ice there can change super super fast from 6 inches to half an inch."
891240,johnnyb,2015-01-09 03:17:00,3413,"I appreciate that Jeremy, I really do.  The only reason I'm considering it is its proximity,  and that I saw some guys had been out on it earlier this week.  Its still quite likely I'll take  my friemd somewhere else....but if we do end up at FBay, I'll be exercising extreme caution."
891242,Acountdeleted,2015-01-09 03:23:00,2562,"Glad to hear. If you are in Mississauga, Island Lake is also an option. Pike and Crappie and they set huts out on the ice there. Best of luck wherever you decide."
891284,BillM,2015-01-09 13:31:00,17367,JohnnyB!  Nice to see you bud
891290,buick14,2015-01-09 14:09:00,741,X2 on island lake
891323,johnnyb,2015-01-09 16:57:00,3413,"Good to see you too Bill!   And yeah, Island Lake could work..... I always forget about that place.  Thanks guys"
891419,John Bacon,2015-01-10 04:18:00,3277,"If you go to Frenchmen's, stay away from the eastern half of the bay.  The eastern half often has open water when there is safe ice on the west side."
892084,chris.brock,2015-01-14 04:17:00,4053,"I can't help you with Frenchman's, but I would like to say I hope you don't be a stranger. You've got a lot to share."
892132,msp,2015-01-14 16:00:00,1336,I had a look. looks frozen stiff to me. Lots of people out fishing and skating.
892369,discophish,2015-01-15 23:47:00,392,People are out on the ice ... park on the west side and access from that end.  Much easier.  Have fun!
892371,Locnar,2015-01-15 23:55:00,645,"Was out today, 7-8"" west side. Beauty ice too. Got skunked though."
892376,johnnyb,2015-01-16 00:28:00,3413,Thanks for all the replies folks...I ended up taking my buddy to Simcoe to show him how not to catch lakers.....he's hooked
892389,Acountdeleted,2015-01-16 03:46:00,2562,Chris K taught me how to do that on Simcoe today too! I am not as enthusiastic.
892779,John Bacon,2015-01-19 00:03:00,3277,Plenty of ice on Frechman's; the fish are a little scarce though.  The skating should be good once the temperature drops tonight.
892780,johnnyb,2015-01-19 00:19:00,3413,"I feel your pain, Jeremy....I'm 0 for 2 on the big lady now.   And thanks for the update John Bacon"
893215,dracokaos,2015-01-20 23:36:00,116,"Hey Guys,  anyone been out on Frenchmans lately? I drove by today and saw a few people. Just wondering if there are any reports?   Hoping to get out on Thursday  Cheers!"
893231,redwings24,2015-01-21 00:27:00,15,"They Johnny B  Did you guys rent a hut for the day?  I'm also looking try out ice fishing also.  If I remember correctly, a hut rental is about $40.00 pp for like 6 hours or so.  All equipment included."
893254,johnnyb,2015-01-21 02:10:00,3413,"Been a long time since I rented a hut redwings.....cant help you there, aside from the obvious: Google it"
893258,Acountdeleted,2015-01-21 02:30:00,2562,I've heard of a lot of skunkings on frenchmans. Between the word getting out and the dredging the pike have packed their bags.
893355,John Bacon,2015-01-21 18:40:00,3277,Not many perch around either.
893563,dracokaos,2015-01-22 19:36:00,116,Got a couple of hours in at Frenchmans today. Didn't do too well. Maybe one or two hits but that was it. It was my first time out this season so I more wanted to set up the flip over and check gear before I head up to Simcoe and my cottage for a some more fishing.  Ice was good. Still can't get comfortable with all the cracking the ice made though...lol  Hope someone had some luck  Cheers
