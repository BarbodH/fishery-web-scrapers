893180,Steel Bunny,2015-01-20 21:28:00,46,A tip is a way to say thank you for a job well done. If he has a boat ready to go when you get there. If he packs a decent lunch . If his boat is clean and well stocked with equipment. Basically if you feel like it is fishing with a friend rather than having someone who just puts in time to have you on the water. Most of the bass fishing is catch and release so him cleaning your fish is not usually a service they offer. I would go for a saltwater trip before a bass trip you will see more beauty as well as fish that fight harder.   Art 
893190,bare foot wader,2015-01-20 22:12:00,1354,"Ive hired one guide in my life and we tipped him because he dropped one of us back at shore early, and because he let us do something illegal on his boat.     THATS what I call going the extra mile  I got a captain you can call in florida..he'll run you from south beach to cuba and back doing some midnight tarpon fishing"
893218,aplumma,2015-01-20 23:43:00,6896,"If I were the guy with the nice clean, well stocked boat, and I was charging the same as the guy next door with a dirty ass old boat, id feel pretty dumb.  If the clean boat charges more than the dirty boat then you point is invalid.   LOL keep it coming! Actually you have no idea if you hired the dirty ass boat till you get there. I have seen $500.00 charters that had broken poles,bait wells that will turn your stomach. lunches of wilted lettuce and lunch meat that should have been condemned. Now if you charter very rarely then you might have not ever chartered with a bad Captain so you don't have a comparison to see how good a trip can be. The other side of the coin is are you a good customer? I have had a few charters that I would allow to come back out for free on a day that I was not chartered but scouting for new spots. I also have a few that I am forever booked and can't possible take them out again. It really is up to how you act as to how you will be treated.  Case in point I was up North and a guide was waiting on the dock for his customer. We talked for a few minutes and I was throwing a saltwater bait and he like the action and said that should be a good Muskie bait. I had another one in my boat so I cut it off and gave it to him. We talked a few minutes more and he asked how my fishing had been and I said great but I was looking for a few more good pike spots. He then did the one thing that most guides never do he started to mark up a map for me of good pike spots. So I got my map and we traded notes of places to catch what we were after. In 10 minutes we both had expanded our knowledge of the water more than we would have in a month of fishing. His only request was not to show others the map since it is how he makes his living and because I fish the waters one week a year he was not concerned about me burning out his spots. That is a GOOD guide who helps everyone he can no matter if he was getting a tip. So you wonder did I give him a tip.... well not in money but I gave hima secret arsenal of baits that the Muskies haven't seen yet.   Art"

Clean boat, on time and friendly does not equal going the extra mile.  It means you are dealing with a professional. Going the extra mile to me, would be dropping me off at shore for lunch because I dont eat chicken salad (or whatever his wife made us).  That is tip worthy.  Letting me drink beer if their policy is 'no beer', thats tip worthy.  Do you see the difference???  If you hook up with someone who delivers less than expected - you didnt do your research.   Art"

893651,gotfish,2015-01-23 04:37:00,53,"I spent the xmas break down in Orlando area and there a ton of fishing oppertunities without using a guide service. First i would recomend renting a boat at Turkey lake. The rental is run buy the cuty of orlando, boat rentals are $33 dollars for four hours 7am - 11am. what they dont tell you is if you arrive early they let you out early. We arrived at 615 and went straigt out after a quil lake rundown. The boats are deep wide john type boats with front electric. I took my two 19yr old nephews with me and had a blast. The one caught his first large mouth that was over 8lbs on a swacky stick bait. Rattle traps  jerk baits and soft plastics is all we used for success. Other fishing oppertunities are all retention ponds at resorts and around commercial areas are stocked with bass to keep a stable water ecosystem or something like that. I was fortunate to hook up with a local who took me to a few local lakes for some awsome bass fishing. I would love to winter in central florida for the fishing oppertunities are endless."
893726,mistaredone,2015-01-23 21:03:00,913,8lbs!  That's awesome!  I caught lots of 1-2lb fish but that was it. The electric was struggling the whole time (excuses) Last time I was there the Turkey lake rentals were only on Thursday to Sunday and need to be booked in advance
893736,solopaddler,2015-01-23 21:41:00,8605," Personally, I'd tip the guide unless he was a complete disaster.  Sometimes 12 cartons of smokes and a new fillet knife eh Billy?"

875802,mistaredone,2014-10-07 22:39:00,913,Hit the bass pro in Orlando and get a 3-7 day licence. Turkey lake has a a really cheap boat rental. You get a flat tinny with an electric motor. The fishing is ok but again really cheap.
875803,mistaredone,2014-10-07 22:42:00,913,"Google satellite is a great way to scout spots. Golf courses, hotels and condos aren't welcoming but there is lots of lakes. I'd recommend hitting the gun range too. Lots of fun!"
