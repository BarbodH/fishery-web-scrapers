Ice was relatively thick in most spots. (just under a foot). On the Friday we got there pretty much for the afternoon fish and didn't get any bites. The Saturday was a bit better. My buddy was able to land the largest fish of the weekend 28"" (released). Unfortunately I wasn't able to get on any fish. I only had one bite the whole weekend and I messed up the hookset! lol The funny thing about that was I left the hole to fish another one and my buddy decided to fish that same hole and what do ya know, he catches a 24"" 4lber. Overall it was a great experience. First time on the BOQ for me, so maybe it was my initiation trip. Perhaps next time I will fair better. I've included a few photos from our trip. Will continue to post as the ice fishing season progresses. Happy fishing everyone! Be safe and dress warm.    "
