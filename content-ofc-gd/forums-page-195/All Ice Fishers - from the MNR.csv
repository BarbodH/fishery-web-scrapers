892543,c10,2015-01-17 03:07:00,131,"Another one I've been told to report is if you ever get an american Eel, both pretty cool species in my opinion."
892576,Acountdeleted,2015-01-17 12:00:00,2562,We got one this past spring at Old Mill on the Humber River. I just sent in an email.  They may be the coolest thing ever.

893541,bassnass,2015-01-22 17:48:00,174,Larry - what's up with mudpups?  Are they important in the food chain?  Why are they so common on Nip - and don't seem to show up many other places?
893571,c10,2015-01-22 20:49:00,131,"There are lots around in the streams in the GTA from what I've heard, its more that they are the only completely aquatic salamander in Canada as well as the largest.  We just don't know a whole ton about them from what I understand.  Also salamanders and other amphibians like frogs are the first to show problems within an ecosystem so it is important that we understand these guys and their habitats before we do some more irreversible damage"
893619,Jon,2015-01-23 00:58:00,209,"C10:  Do you have any pics or more specific reports of them in GTA streams? I know a bunch of people in the local Conservation Authorities and MNRF office would be interested.  Thanks in advance,  Jon"
893641,reelinrolly,2015-01-23 03:17:00,281,"I have always been annoyed with people that just throw theses fish / salamanders on the ice to die.  The way I have understood it was that it was illegal, due to the fact that the ministry uses these fish as a gauging tool to study the local ecosystem.  Anyone have any information on this??"

I know a bunch of people in the local Conservation Authorities and MNRF office would be interested.  Thanks in advance,  Jon  I have no pictures.  I have only ever seen others catch them - from complete strangers to my friends and dad one time (a long time ago though) lol... Not sure what they have against me   I suppose it saves them the pain though.  They sure are cool looking I think. I could send in what I have seen, do you have a specific person(s) in mind that I should contact? Feel free to PM me Jon! As well - Sorry if I mislead you eh, I seem to be doing that on here far too often recently through poorly worded sentences, sorry all!  Reelinrolly - It is certainly wrong to just kill something without the intent to use it for food morally in my opinion, but i am not sure if it is illegal to kill these guys (for food or if you could be charged for killing one - I wouldn't eat one though lol)? I know they are not considered ""at risk"" under the federal species at risk act from 2007 nor by the International Union for Conservation of Nature.  I think they are only looking for more information on populations health etc. of the species  And you are right Woodsman, I think they are doing an independent study, but that is only speculation.  Though I would be surprised if the MNR didn't want information on Mud Puppies, I know they want information on American Eels however, that add is in the regulations book."

894217,Afraz,2015-01-26 02:28:00,250,"    I wish someone told me about this before, otherwise i would have taken measurements before letting the fish go.  I've caught American Eel every year out of the BOQ, a few years ago that's all we could catch some nights while bottom fishing, slimey buggers they were, back in they went !  But last year we just got a few not many at all, maybe just a seasonal variance ? or something more sinister ?  I'll be shooting off an email to Kirby punt and letting em know where we get into them in numbers."
894218,Broker,2015-01-26 02:31:00,482,Had one today at long point bay. Wouldn't leave the area and began to be an annoyance yanking minnows off my hook. Got some sweet videos that I will post later off him
