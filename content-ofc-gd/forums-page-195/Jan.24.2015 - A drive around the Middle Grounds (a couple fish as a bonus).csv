Out in the middle grounds, it reminded me of the hardened lava fields in Hawaii.......only this was jagged pack ice with more pressure cracks then we've ever seen. Brutal to drive over. I managed to pick up a few nice, fat lakers out there so it made the drive well worth it! The fish were super picky today but tricked them with a little sparkle and flash of the Bass Magnet Lures 4"" chartreuse Tinsel Tubes.Colin"
894018,Fisherpete,2015-01-25 00:43:00,1814,Nice! Cool pics too - like the editing
894179,Joeytier,2015-01-25 22:35:00,3990,"Cool!  Love the glare ice, hope we can get some of that later in the year.  Lakes are getting nasty with deep heavy snow and slush up here now"

894230,John Bacon,2015-01-26 05:07:00,3277,It was a tough bite out of Innisfil today.  Not many caught fish from what I heard.  Lots of pressure cracks; one of my partners got a little wet from one.
894239,wormdunker,2015-01-26 11:08:00,1711,Awesome pix!  Thanx.  What is that lure hanging out of his yapper?
894240,Fisherpete,2015-01-26 11:37:00,1814,I think that is one of the Bass Magnet tinsel tubes he mentioned
