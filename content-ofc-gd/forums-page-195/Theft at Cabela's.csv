893583,solopaddler,2015-01-22 22:11:00,8605,"Funny mullet story. We were on our way back from Nakina driving through the night and we pulled into the Timmies in New Liskeard at 1 in the morning. We grabbed coffee and were standing around the truck in the deserted parking lot when an old black Chevy pick up came tearing into the lot. It was jacked up with flaming lightning bolts painted down the sides and Van Halen just BOOMING on the stereo. We turned in unison and stared and Dougie (skud on the board) says ""10-1 that guy has a mullet"". The door opens and this skinny weasly looking guy hops out. Acid washed jeans, muscle shirt and the cheesiest looking mullet I've ever seen in my life LOL! All four of us burst out laughing and mullet guy actually looks behind him thinking there was maybe something else we were laughing at. He looked really pissed."

893389,kickingfrog,2015-01-21 22:20:00,8333,"Link has a very clear video:  http://www.thebarrieexaminer.com/2015/01/21/barrie-police-looking-for-two-men   More than $1,000 worth of goods were pinched from Cabela's in south-Barrie on Tuesday evening. City police received a 6:40 p.m. call about a theft at the hunting, fishing, camping and outdoor store at Park Place. Video footage from Cabela's shows two males entering the store, then selecting a Garmin camera and various pieces of clothing. Police say the tags were removed and the pair left the store, making no attempt to pay. Both men are Caucasian, with large builds and weigh about 300 pounds each. One had a goatee, was wearing a bright orange construction jacket with a black 'CAT' ball cap, blue jeans and black running shoes. The second man had a partial beard and was wearing a black and navy blue ARCTIVA snowmobile jacket, a red and white hat and grey jogging pants. Due to the quality of the surveillance video and the unique clothing worn by the men, police believe they will be recognized. Anyone with information about this incident or who recognizes the suspects is asked to call Const. Osborne at 705-725-7025, extension 2738 or Crime Stoppers at 1-800-222-8477."

893393,solopaddler,2015-01-21 22:37:00,8605,Watching the video one of them bought a bottle pop using what appeared to be a debit or credit card. Could it be a future episode of world's dumbest criminals?

893416,lookinforwalleye,2015-01-22 00:35:00,4399,busy store....
893419,lookinforwalleye,2015-01-22 00:39:00,4399,They may be harder to find than you think the last time I was in that store half the clientele fit that discription...
893421,kickingfrog,2015-01-22 00:42:00,8333,Hey!?
893426,misfish,2015-01-22 00:48:00,29133,"Hey!?  Dont feel bad,I was thinking the same thing."
893435,irishfield,2015-01-22 01:07:00,26272,Wasn't much different at Christmas either Gord! Won't last long...
893436,misfish,2015-01-22 01:11:00,29133,Wasn't much different at Christmas either Gord! Won't last long...  They need to lower their prices. We all know that.  The hunting section well keep them a float. Thats a given.
893441,solopaddler,2015-01-22 01:26:00,8605,What they need to do is put one in the GTA!!!
893442,irishfield,2015-01-22 01:27:00,26272,They could put it next door to Basspro and still be dead.. when you charge $59.99 for a $31 auger cover.
893443,solopaddler,2015-01-22 01:32:00,8605,I would shop there in a heart beat if it wasn't in Barrie. Fortunately the one in Buffalo isn't too far.
893449,bare foot wader,2015-01-22 01:54:00,1354,BPS beats Cabelas hands down in Canada...but that's a different discussion...
893450,big guy,2015-01-22 01:56:00,414,I wonder if those 300 pound guys will turn out to be 160 pounders if they ever catch them. Perhaps the extra bulk was tackle and clothing stuffed under their over-sized coats.
893451,big guy,2015-01-22 01:57:00,414,BPS beats Cabelas hands down in Canada...but that's a different discussion...  And Sail and LeBaron beats BPS.

893484,solopaddler,2015-01-22 12:46:00,8605,"  Something tells me Mike, you would be disappointed.  Maybe, maybe not. I'm not a typical shopper in that I don't really care what the price is if a store has what I want. I've always been a huge fan of the Cabela's branded products which imo is what sets them apart. Now if I went into the Barrie store and they didn't have what I was looking for, then yeah I'd be disappointed.  I do enjoy a good deal though, no denying that. Closer to home I've scored some wicked deals at the store in Buffalo scouring the online bargain bin and using free store to store shipping. Last week I picked up a $240 insulated gore tex parka for $40."
893485,BillM,2015-01-22 12:52:00,17367,I just submit my orders directly to Mike and he figures out where the best deals are  :)
893486,big guy,2015-01-22 12:54:00,414,"  Something tells me Mike, you would be disappointed.  Man I sure was. We went there last summer and from my perspective it was a complete waste of gas. Have always ordered from Cabela's via mail and have always been more than satisfied, but the store was a huge let down. Won't be back."
893507,moxie,2015-01-22 15:07:00,1566,"They may be harder to find than you think the last time I was in that store half the clientele fit that discription... LMAO. Plastered from head to toe with Duck Dynasty and Nascar logos. LOL. Barrie and surrounding area dinner attire, no? I particularly love the subtlety of the safety jacket."
