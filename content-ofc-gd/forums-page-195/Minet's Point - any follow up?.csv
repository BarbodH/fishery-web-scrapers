892201,Freshtrax,2015-01-15 00:44:00,2215,Like they give a damn when searching for a body.   Better pointing up where you cansee it than laying on the ice with snow over it.   I

I fished out there Saturday and had an officer from the OPP come by my hub  to let me know they would be diving in the area. I had asked if they had found the body. His answer was no.

Their holes are marked like said..Unsafe as they may seem,they are markers for them. If anyone has a concern with the way they have laided out the holes, they need to contact the Barrie OPP Marine Under water recovery unit or the Barrie police."

893237,Terry,2015-01-21 00:47:00,14456,if we get a good dumping of snow someone will wreck a skidoo on them
