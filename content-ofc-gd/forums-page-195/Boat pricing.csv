893120,AKRISONER,2015-01-20 17:41:00,5558,gotta pay to play. I would personally never buy a new boat but thats just me. Too many idiots out there that buy boats and then use them one season and then they leave them parked in their garage for the next 10 years.  My pops bought a 28 foot rinker for 70% off cause it was 2 years old and had a whopping 10 hours on it.
893131,irishfield,2015-01-20 18:40:00,26272,"Well I guess I've used mine... so I'm not an idiot !! But again, many may have a different opinion on that....  It's like buying a new car/ truck, or letting someone else take the depreciation hit and you buying it used. Always defendable arguments for both sides."
893199,35Wailin,2015-01-20 22:43:00,59,"I agree about knowing that they are underpowered and taking that into consideration when you buy, however, I bought a Crestliner 16' with a 25 Johnson and trailer for about $1000 more than a similar boat from them with a 9.9.  The engine upgrade alone was $1500, plus I got the winch strap, bearing buddies, transom strap and transom saver thrown in as well.  That would have been another $450 or more from the whitefish guys."
893211,musky666,2015-01-20 23:24:00,126,Some boats list a minimum HP requirement as well- makes sense from a safety and usability viewpoint.
893235,Gallie,2015-01-21 00:36:00,1215,"I would have loved a new boat but couldnt stand the idea of making the same payments as i do on my daily driver. My 12 ft aluminum with a homebuilt trolling motor transom, homemade cupholders,self mounted rod holders, and a humminbird fishfinder installed by yours truly with a 99 8hp johnson cost me a grand total of ... $1300 I personally guarentee this boat catches big fish on small water?  To compensate for my big water needs i bought a 1990 chapparal with a v8 305, rod holders and manual riggers installed in a garage near you for the whopping tag of 2g.  Together these two will take me anywhere anytime, it just goes to show what you can do on a budget with a little work. Im much happier spending my hard earned money on fishing gear as opposed to x$ a month on fishing transportation. Happy fishing...and boating"
893238,porkpie,2015-01-21 00:55:00,2521,"The ranger prices are out of this world no doubt.  That said, I believe you have the right to spend as much of your money as you can afford on toys if that's your thing!  I was considering new this year, and was ok with the idea of a payment.  My wife actually encouraged this route, as she saw all the bells and whistles on the new rigs like the fold down jump seats, mp3 plug ins etc.  She almost had me convinced, and then just like that I found a great ( unadvertised) deal through a member here on a Lund pike with a honda out back.  I was able to pay cash with the down payment I would've put on the other boat, and no doubt it will last me a while!  I agree with the guy who said you have to pay to play.  It all depends how much you want to spend!"
893239,DRIFTER_016,2015-01-21 01:00:00,10439,I bought my boat 24 years ago and I still love it. 4 years ago I updated the console and 2 years ago I swapped out the original 2 stroke for a new 115 4 stroke. Should be good for a few more years.
893242,Terry,2015-01-21 01:27:00,14456,loans for toys I don't like  thats why I pay cash for my new lund and atv  of course I have to get a loan to buy food...lol

893289,Garnet,2015-01-21 12:17:00,2056,"What's need got to do with it.  They are fun, comfortable and unlike a mussel cars I can scare the crap out of my self legally."
893376,35Wailin,2015-01-21 20:25:00,59,I bought my boat in '99 for $150/mo for 60 months.  Paid in full 11 years ago and still have four years left on the hull weld warranty.  Planning on a new outboard if my union doesn't call a strike in late spring.  I should easily get another 15-20 years out of my investment.
893528,Wagoneer,2015-01-22 16:14:00,118,Same technique at boat shows as there are at car shows. Manufacturers want that initial starting price as low as possible so they can plaster it all over their advertisements. US car companies are especially good at this. If you buy a base model sub-compact vehicle at the base price (which really only car rental lots do) you're basically getting a chassis and an engine.
892738,HTHM,2015-01-18 21:35:00,4082,"I went to the boat show yesterday, and was amazed at the price for a brand new Ranger bass boat. Over 90,000 with all the bells and whistles. Don't see one of those in my future, ever."
892739,misfish,2015-01-18 21:43:00,29133,"My toon cost me $200 bucks,and I caught lots of bass last year. They dont move that fast after all."
892740,Terry,2015-01-18 21:48:00,14456,at 90 thousand   they won't be moving too fast either lol
892741,irishfield,2015-01-18 21:52:00,26272,I'm sure they'll fill their production quota...

892744,beertech,2015-01-18 22:11:00,118,what bothered me more was all the boat show special prices included a way underpowered motor.  One manufacturer had a 15 hp on a 18 foot pontoon boat.  believe 90 was max.  not one boat there came with max hp on it.  but i guess i missed the ranger lol

I think they do that on purpose so it looks affordable and then try to get you to upgrade."
892763,aplumma,2015-01-18 23:27:00,6896,I rebuilt my 89 Ranger as well. It was the last year that they used that hull design with the encapsulated wood bows and stringers. It was the ride that made me love that specific year. I bought the boat for1500.oo 6 years ago and tore into it over a winter with an additional 2800.oo. I replaced the impeller and some additional work on the lower end this winter and it is getting the new xi5 trolling motor for the spring fishing season. All in all I still have less than 7000.oo into that boat and it is good enough that I will repower it if the 150 Johnson blows up.   Art
892808,Lape0019,2015-01-19 02:59:00,647,"This is also the reason why you see so many ""pro"" staff boats in our area.  Getting a boat that was ran for a season at $20,000 less really helps a lot of people out.  My issue is a WANT a boat like that and don't mine paying $500 a month for it. What kills me is that after 20 years when I would be done paying for it, I could have bought two of them for that price.  I've decided to let someone else take that huge hit. I have a plan to buy something of that caliber but I can guarantee it will be at least 6 years old.  And with a savings of $30,000 at least over new, I will sleep better at night!!! I will hopefully be able to save up as much as I can before purchasing so monthly payments will either be low or non existant!  Adam"
892813,DRIFTER_016,2015-01-19 03:34:00,10439,$90G's is a damn fine down payment on a real boat!!!  Like one of these!!!  http://www.kingfisherboats.com/
892841,Garnet,2015-01-19 13:51:00,2056,Everybody is talking about 22 ft Ranger for 103k. Limited sale price 83k.  Guess the US economy has recoved.

892888,jimmer,2015-01-19 18:51:00,2730,"They are built for US Tournament Pros and people with too much money. Like some else said, I catch plenty of bass out of my 14' smokercraft; and what they use in a day for gas would last me a whole month."

I fish ponds with a 600.00 boat and the ocean in a 100,000.oo boat. average ocean trip is 400.oo in expenses. It isn't that I have excessive money it is that it is worth 400.oo to take 8 people out comfortably and safely for a day of fun and fishing.   Art"

I was talking to a guy who was pulling out his brand new vessel from them.  He stopped me to ask a question about water spraying up when he was under way, they mounted the transducer in the wrong spot.  He said ""you look like you know a bit about boats"".

The hull is made by Fisher as is the trailer and is very good and well built on both accounts. The only wood on my boat is two pieces of teak trim and the core of the transom. The stringers and floor boards are all aluminum.  If you know going in what to expect you can upgrade to a decent package, but if you go in uniformed you will very well walk away with a sub standard rig."
893058,Fishwilly,2015-01-20 12:33:00,206,I bought a Legend 18' Xtreme and couldn't be happier. Their marketing strategy with underpowering is only to get people in the door then they upsell. I knew that going into the deal and when the dust settled ended paying about the same as most aluminums out there. Took the boat out on lake Ontario a few times and runs like a top. Very solid boat. My two cents.
