894244,lew,2015-01-26 12:02:00,12766," Lew - Too bad you are located too far from my garage.  I'm sure I could fabricate a bracket to hold your monitor.  And it will only cost you a Timmies - large double cream!  LOL!  I had to look Fonthill up on GOOGLE but see now your correct, for what it would cost me in gas $$$$ to get to your shop I could buy a new monitor  But I do thank you for the offer."
894251,lew,2015-01-26 13:21:00,12766,Got my part ordered from a supplier for $12 in Mississaugua and should have it in a week or so.  Thanks boyz.  Life would be much easier if important weight bearing parts for expensive electronics weren't being made out of cheap plastic crap to save a dollar.

894267,lew,2015-01-26 14:31:00,12766,"  nice!  its this disposable world we live in, nothing is made to last, everything is made to be replaced  Yup, but the price never comes down on the cheap disposable garbage.  I'm heading out to the shop shortly to make up a temporary stand to hold the screen and it'll be far superior to what came OEM"
894363,Big Cliff,2015-01-26 22:28:00,6899,"So, why would you spend $12.00 to replace what you had?"
894365,lew,2015-01-26 22:53:00,12766,"So, why would you spend $12.00 to replace what you had?  What I did today is just a jury rig Cliff but I may upgrade it yet and keep the new piece as a spare or whatever."
893982,lew,2015-01-24 22:46:00,12766,"Wife and I are out in the kitchen an hour ago and we hear a bang coming from the den so I walk in to find my 25"" computer screen laying face down on the desk.....WHAT THE HECK ??  This bracket is screwed onto the back of the screen    That 1"" square tab slides into the arm of this base    And the darned thing just snapped off     Screen still works fine so that's a good thing but I'm using the laptop now and will call LG on Monday and see if they've got another bracket.  I dunno, but it seems harder to find decent quality products anymore.  "
893998,c10,2015-01-24 23:35:00,131,"Almost impossible, it seems companies want things to break so you have to buy more of it... Depends though, that being said I have only ever had two phones, both LG's and neither of them have broken.  I know friends who have been through four phones in the time I have had my second (about four years now) and they are much nicer to their phones than I have been to mine, oh well. I would be surprised if they didn't give you a new bracket though that certainly looks defective, but then again I am no expert lol"

894013,mukluk,2015-01-25 00:20:00,196,Likely made west of British Columbia like most items we purchase these days Lew.

894071,lew,2015-01-25 11:56:00,12766,I've had numerous small plastic items break  Doesn't really show in the pictures but that piece of plastic that snapped is quite flimsy and makes you wonder why they wouldn't use something a little more substantial to hold the weight of a 25 inch screen.
894072,outllaw,2015-01-25 12:19:00,1232,long gone are the years of quality its all plastic crapola. lew do you remember when we actually fixed things lol.. yes folks there were times when you fixed it for re-use.

894074,Handlebarz,2015-01-25 12:53:00,3790,Dang that's not good at all but like you and others have said its a toss out world now and cheapest is best. Dad bought a LG TV years ago it went on the crapper right away nothing but troubles with it we looked online and sure enough there was a day of reading on the same problems from LG I will never buy a LG product even if it was the last TV out there I will go with out. Hope they fix you up Lew if not I'm sure a OFC member will be able to make a fancy metal one for you.
894078,lew,2015-01-25 13:22:00,12766,a OFC member will be able to make a fancy metal one for you.  That's what it should have been in the 1st place Mike.  The LG screen is actually pretty nice though with excellent clarity and colors although it doesn't seem so good laying flat on it's face.  There's a computer repair place in town that's pretty good so I'll go see him tomorrow before I try tracking it down online.
894079,lew,2015-01-25 13:34:00,12766,"Thanks for the link FloatnFly, if the fella in town can't help me I'll give them a try."

I declined the offer, but it was still a fantastic offer, and great customer service, they have a customer for life now."
894083,lew,2015-01-25 14:18:00,12766,"Yeah, good customer service like that goes a VERY long way."

As much as I would like to upgrade my plasma, I can't bring myself to do it as this tv still looks great and works flawlessly after 5 years...  It owes me nothing. I would purchase LG again.  G"
894104,outllaw,2015-01-25 15:21:00,1232,customer should be the highest priority. at markups of 500 per-cent on many products they should re-place no problems. Lew remember when we wore soles of shoes out the shoe guy sewed new soles on them. the knife guy came bye and sharpened your knives/scissors. . well now we just send it the landfill. hey maybe we can have new landfill locations. build them in china
894109,lew,2015-01-25 15:34:00,12766,"  Lew remember when we wore soles of shoes out the shoe guy sewed new soles on them.   And I also remember wearing  steel cleats on my heels so they WOULDN'T wear out George. Trouble was though, the shoes would be 15 years out of style before they needed to be replaced"
894120,wormdunker,2015-01-25 16:40:00,1711,You remember cleats?  So do I!  Maybe I am as old as you??  I loved the sound they made while walking on a concrete floor in school.  Yes - we did have a school!  I tied my horse up out back!!

894148,Canuck2fan,2015-01-25 19:46:00,1444, Doesn't really show in the pictures but that piece of plastic that snapped is quite flimsy and makes you wonder why they wouldn't use something a little more substantial to hold the weight of a 25 inch screen.  When you factor in the cost of shipping from overseas every 1/4 of an ounce drives the price up incredibly. That is why outsourcing has NOT saved companies or companies nearly as much as the globalists would likes us to believe. Also having to buy replacements every 3 to 5 yrs on major purchases isn't saving the consumer anything in the long run.
894209,fishindevil,2015-01-26 01:24:00,6254,"Yes I have and need a $5 rocker switch for my $500 frameless electric fireplace I bought from Canadian tire !!!!! Of course the warranty is some china address and you call them and it's also a call line for black & decker and you have to punch in a dozen numbers and codes and serial numbers then leave a message for them too call you back !!!! It's. Never going to happen as a 12yr old girl on the factory floor won't know how to speak English or know what the pArt is !!!!!!! I'm gonna loose it on this crap ..... DONT BUY ANYTHING ANYMORE WORTH MORE THAN 100$ WITHPUT CHECKING THE WARRANRY CAUSE THEY ALL SAY NOW PLEASE DO NOT BRING BACK TO STORE AND NOW ITS A COMANY THAT HANDLES SEVERAL OTHER COMPANIES ..........

894236,Big Cliff,2015-01-26 10:54:00,6899,"Well, a couple of things!  First of all, Lew if you wanted to bring that monitor and those pieces over here I bet we could make a piece out of wood that would fit the bill perfectly, use some high gloss black paint and you'd probably never know it was repaired.  Second, If I need electronics (and lots of other things) I go to Costco, they automatically extend the Manufacturers warranty by two years and they have excellent help lines. I needed an adaptor to go from an audio digital out put to an analog input but it had to be a specific format, I called their help line and without hesitation the young lady was able to answer my question and in excellent English.  The best price I could find on the part I needed anywhere in Canada or the US was about $50.00 +. I ordered it from China delivered to my door for $11.00 and it is the exact same one that I'd have paid $50.00+ for here."

894241,wormdunker,2015-01-26 11:42:00,1711,"Thanx guys, lottsa good info here! c10 - It's a 2008 King Ranch with only 90k on it.  $190.00 at the dealer vs $26.00 for the same part is not a nickel or even a dime difference!  LOL! Cliff - Thanx for the info about Costco extending the warranty by 2 years - AWESOME! Lew - Too bad you are located too far from my garage.  I'm sure I could fabricate a bracket to hold your monitor.  And it will only cost you a Timmies - large double cream!  LOL!  After discovering the pricing on ebay, (ebay is new to me) I've decided NOT to purchase anything unless I go on line & check their pricing first. Another good story.  The clerk at a business supply store advised me to purchase the Otter phone case (charging case) on ebay cause it is only 50 bux - his store price $100.00!  WOW!"
