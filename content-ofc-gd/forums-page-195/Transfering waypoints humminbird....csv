894212,mike rousseau,2015-01-26 01:53:00,4661,Ok  I managed to get the Nav data onto the as card...  But can't figure out how to get it onto the new unit
894214,DRIFTER_016,2015-01-26 02:08:00,10439,Turn off the 788 insert the sd card and power on the 788. It should ask you if you what you want to do with the data on the card.
894221,mike rousseau,2015-01-26 02:45:00,4661,Not workin  Maybe cause I'm using a portable pack... I'll try it in the boat tomorrow
