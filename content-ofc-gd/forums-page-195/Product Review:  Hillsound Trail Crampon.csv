893796,Burtess,2015-01-24 03:14:00,901,"I picked up a pair of Hillsound Trail Crampons just after Christmas from Sail. Todays beautiful black ice with no snow was a perfect time to try them out.  http://hillsound.com/hillsound-product/trail-crampon/  These have a little bit more ""spike"" to them than the Kahtoola Microspikes, they are about 50% longer than the Microspikes. All the spikes on the ball and the heel of the foot are made out of one piece each of hardened steel, unlike the Kahtoola that have small spikes attached to the chains. They also have a Velcro strap that makes sure the device stays on your boot.  I went with the XL size to fit my size 9 Kamik feltpacs and my Baffin Titans. I could have used the L but the XL were easier to get on and of course the strap snugs them up more as well.  Didn't feel strange walking in them and they gave wicked grip. I don't know how I made do with the cheapo ones for so long, these are the cats meow!      Burt"
