893241,Fisherman,2015-01-21 01:24:00,7201,"I look at it from the other side of the coin.  It costs about $50 for a 5lb tank, good for 10 years, $5 a year.  It costs about $3.75 to fill or .75 a lb.  Good for 4-5 outings, get it refilled on the way home.  There's no limit on how many times you can get it refilled within the 10 year period.  I don't think you would want to try that with a 1lb throw away tank.  Even if you had ten of them, you still have to pay for the initial cost of the 1lb tanks, now who is ahead.  You still have to pay for the adapter and take a chance that something might leak.  At Costco you pay by the pound, not a flat rate."
893245,irishfield,2015-01-21 01:49:00,26272,Tanks are free.. drop by any Provincial Park and fill a firewood bag with them. The park warden will thank you for hauling them away... as they absolutely HATE them. I grabbed a new batch in September for the guys.

893319,pics,2015-01-21 15:50:00,1268,I too pick up new tanks from the provincial parks. I only open the valve for 1 minute and I never get a full pound in the tank. With the price to fill at costco around $11 for the 20 lbs it costs well under a dollar per fill up. After filling and soapy water testing they get stored outside or on my heater. I got 5 hours of heat from my partly filled tank with my small heater. My hands tend to get cold so I have to have a heater...plus I'm getting old..lol

I don't burn enough propane in a winter to go this route, but it's great knowledge to have. Also agree with the common sense notion. If you're sloppy and careless, not something you should be doing.

As for the forklifts, they actually run the liquid propane through the valve into the carberator somewhere, maybe before to allow the liquid to expand into a gas first?  Either way, there is a high likelihood of leaking liquid propane."
893202,irishfield,2015-01-20 22:51:00,26272,"I understand how it works... you shut off the valve on either before you disconnect the hose making it a non-event. That is unless a stuck check valve on the fork truck lets the hose blow back the bit of pressure left in it, hense the gloves at work in case that 0.000002% chance happens. As noted I do have fork trucks, 4 of them to be exact in the plant that are all electric now... except I did keep one propane truck and it's in my hangar at home to unload trucks.  Refilling the one pounders.. as stated before. The adapter is 2"" long. The 20 lb tank valve gets opened to fill and then closed again to stop the fill. Then unscrew the 1 lb tank holding the bottom of the tank. There may be a little squirt... 10"" away from your hand at the top of the tank. None issue. While you're still holding the bottom of the tank...check for leaks, if in the rare event the tank is leaking or spitting propane for some reason, toss it to one side. You are filling outside after all, well or in my porch.  We seem to beat this horse every winter... and like all the others you either are comfortable doing this, or you are not.

As the level in the 20lb goes down, it takes longer. Use soap and water to test the seal after on the 1 lb. After a few uses (5-6) they will leak.There's lots of crap in most 20lb tanks.

As for those gloves 35wailwin, thank the labour board and  / or you health and safety committee for that. Probably not a bad idea, but do you do that to change your BBQ tank at home??? You probably should I guess, as there is no difference between it and that 33 pounder on the fork truck. The propane ""gods"" got so bad that we got rid of our propane trucks all together at the plant and went totally electric trucks, just to keep the Labour board at bay from their nonsense.  Filling a one pounder from a 20, using strictly the pressure in the tank is a LOT safer than filling a 20 from that big ass tank in the yard with a pump.... and yes I have a licence to do that, as does my wife, my in-laws and at least one of the sister-in-laws.  Watching the old man fill a 100 pounder with an outdated rusty valve, that my wife refused to fill, and having it blow off the weight scale and into the ditch... all while the customer was standing beside said ditch (now full of propane) with a smoke in his mouth... now that may make your heart skip a beat or two! Filling a one from a twenty.... only illegal because someone wasn't making money and lobbied against it."
893036,Old Ironmaker,2015-01-20 03:47:00,8243,The only difference between changing a tank at home and at the plant is our operators would change more tanks in a week than in a few years at home. It's the theory of compound exposure to failure. Yes I worked for MOL here in Ontario for a while. Simply put if you pump gas for a living you are more likely to spill gas on yourself than the guy doing it every 10 days.

893038,ch312,2015-01-20 04:21:00,1590,"We are required to wear elbow length rubber gloves when we change the propane tanks on the forklifts at work. When liquid propane escapes and evaporates, it WILL cause frost bite on exposed skin. I would not risk it for the money you would save. I would buy a 5 pound refillable and an adapter hose instead.    This is what people who have never used these adapters fail to understand as they simply think that something the government has banned must be an evil and deadly child killing device.There is no crazy amounts of propane flying around. There are no exploding tanks because safety features on the tanks prevent this. Filling your car at the gas station is likely more dangerous.  It's comparable to changing the tank on your BBQ. How many of you think that is a huge safety risk?"
893040,chris.brock,2015-01-20 04:25:00,4053,thanks for clearing that up for us citiots
893046,bigugli,2015-01-20 05:28:00,6138," The relief valve does not always work. I just refilled my 20lb last month. Guess what? It got over filled. The attendant was not paying attention to the scale and was relying on the valve to do it's job. Was spitting liquid for a bit, but I've got it working fine now."
892868,icefisherman,2015-01-19 17:31:00,952,"Just bought new Buddy heater and remember people talking about ways to refill their one pound tanks instead of keeping buying new ones. Can someone tell me where to find a good deal on the adapter needed and how well this process work? Thanks,  Cheers, Ice Fisherman"

892890,icefisherman,2015-01-19 19:03:00,952,"Thanks guys. Was at Cabelas on Friday and bought new St. Croix ice rod....damn....wish I knew they sell the adapter as well so I don't make a special trip for it. Oh well... Do I really need that filter too? I was reading if you stop gas flow from the 20 lb tank valve first and let gar in hose burn you don't need the filter?  Cheers, Ice Fisherman"
892892,mike rousseau,2015-01-19 19:21:00,4661,"As far as I know refilling and transporting refilled 1lb tanks is illigal in canada....  But...  ""I know a guy"" that got one of those fittings and has been refilling 1lb tanks for years... No filters... No problems... Used on a portable buddy heater...  Just keep in mind the valves on those tanks aren't designed for refilling... My buddy had a tank from ice fishing he forgot in his truck... Got to be 30 degrees outside and the tank leaked propane in his truck.... Since then he treats 1lb propane tanks with more respect..."
892897,bare foot wader,2015-01-19 19:42:00,1354,"what is the process for refilling? simply trust the relief valve to work and shut off when propane starts leaking? or hang on a scale?  time to google this, I prefer the 5lb tank for ice fishing, but would be great to refill 1lb tanks for the deer blinds"
892900,lookinforwalleye,2015-01-19 20:04:00,4399,This topic was well debated sometime ago...a search should bring it up.
892903,DRIFTER_016,2015-01-19 20:09:00,10439,Your large cylinder needs to be at room temp and the 1#er should be kept in the freezer to cool down prior to filling in order to get the best fill. The large cylinder should be upside down during filling as well.  The filter keeps contaminants that may be introduced into the refillable cylinder (from the refilling center) from clogging up the venturi. For the price it provides good peace of mind if you're using bulk cylinders.
892904,icefisherman,2015-01-19 20:18:00,952,"Does Princess Auto or some other place sell them in the GTA to avoid the drive again to Barrie before my next fishing trip?  Also isn't that the same hose I use for connecting my 20 lbs tank to my camping cooking stove or my camping propane lantern? If so I have it and will not need to spend on it.  Thanks.  Cheers, Ice Fisherman"
892906,xxgoaler,2015-01-19 20:49:00,106,"Went to Princess auto and they told me they can't sell them, because they are illegal to sell in Canada, checked on line down the states and they say restricted in Canada"
892910,icefisherman,2015-01-19 20:59:00,952,"hmmmm....just checked Cabelas.ca site and they are not there even though they are on Cabelas.com....  so back to the original question where does one buy one of those things in Canada?  Cheers, Ice Fisherman"
892914,Fisherpete,2015-01-19 21:10:00,1814,I've been looking for quite some time with no luck... Let me know if you find any please!

892936,woodenboater,2015-01-19 22:08:00,2277,I like my fingers and other body parts so prefer to use 5 or 10 lb tanks. A propane fitter I know had some scary stories of people who tried to refill their 1 lbers but things went wrong.
892941,fish_fishburn,2015-01-19 22:18:00,1311,Seen them in crappy tire  a couple years ago. The last few times I have looked for them and there were none.
892944,chris.brock,2015-01-19 22:27:00,4053,"Wow, you learn something new everyday. I never knew this was possible.  On the other hand, propane scares me. I saw a friends ice hut after an explosion."
892945,Terry,2015-01-19 22:28:00,14456,"and back to my first answer  buy on line from the usa chances are you can't buy in canada, they are illegal"

If so I have it and will not need to spend on it.  Thanks.  Cheers, Ice Fisherman  I'm using the hose I bought @ CT for my coleman stove. As I said, I also purchased the filter from Bass Pro to use with it."
892953,mike rousseau,2015-01-19 22:43:00,4661,TSC stores carry them in USA... $20 last I checked....  Another safety precaution is to pour soapy water over the valve when filling is complete to check for leaks...    Lots of YouTube videos for this process...(
892955,Bernie,2015-01-19 22:56:00,3190,Besides the danger of leaks when transferring the main risk is overfilling a tank. Propane containers must not be filled past 80% of the capacity. The remaining 20% allows for pressure expansion.Liquid inside a container filled to the top leaves no room to expand. So when temperature rises the only way for this pressure can be relieved is the expansion of the container itself. All it takes is a few degrees for this to happen and allow the tank to rupture. When filling propane cylinders you must know the capacity of the tank and how much it weighs. Then fill on a scale.Some cylinders have a bleed valve you can open that allows liquid propane to come out when it reaches the 80% level.

892958,irishfield,2015-01-19 23:14:00,26272,Yah.. I use to say that Dave and didn't believe there was any way to possibly overfill a 1 pounder....... then I hung out with Terry and Lloyd a little longer! LMAO  Time it... and time it accurately.. the fill time. Start short and work your way up. This year I have a digital scale that I forgot I even had in the shop... so we can tare an empty and then time and weigh until we get it to a science.
892959,Bernie,2015-01-19 23:14:00,3190,"OK, I stand corrected, my intention was for a container for an example of what can happen.But when the relief valve does open it allows the contents to escape which is also quite dangerous.Those of us that understand the physics and able to do things such as this safely is fine. But there are many that do not which is why it is banned in Canada."
