893709,Locnar,2015-01-23 19:15:00,645,Sweet jesus!    Take me under your wing! Nice friggin fish man.
893712,Jds63,2015-01-23 19:36:00,1365,sounds like a successful morning !!!! .. best to stick with what works ... the Sebile Vibrato is expensive for sure
893713,Acountdeleted,2015-01-23 19:42:00,2562,"Man, I gotta follow you guys out on the ice sometimes. Great job. You guys are killin it."
893717,Beavertail,2015-01-23 19:49:00,331,"Sounds like another great morning out there. Jeez, trying to improve on a record of 14/16 is setting the bar pretty high! You've got it dialed in...changing to a Vibrado ain't going to help any! I guess it can be fun to catch fish on new lures/techniques though. Thanks for the report and pics."
893719,Terry,2015-01-23 20:11:00,14456,yup you're right into them
893720,davey buoy,2015-01-23 20:18:00,5505,"Awesome numbers!!!!,how much for a guide service out ?lol.Well done."
893727,manjo39,2015-01-23 21:04:00,354,"Was that you that I talked to at True Canadian Outdoors?  We talked about the Meegs, the Vibrato and our kids. I ended up buying a Vibrato and almost immediately regretted it."
893733,misfish,2015-01-23 21:28:00,29133,Im sure glad I bought two of those colored meegs.  Nice job.
893735,icefisherman,2015-01-23 21:40:00,952,"Was that you that I talked to at True Canadian Outdoors?  We talked about the Meegs, the Vibrato and our kids. I ended up buying a Vibrato and almost immediately regretted it.  Well small world and it rotates Bud....yep it was me....I am going to put mine for sale on Kijiji ha ha ha ;-) I can think of few better ways to spend $17 See if they agree we return them for half price  Cheers, Ice Fisherman"

893766,irishfield,2015-01-24 00:23:00,26272,So it's you that drills those leg breaker holes Emil !!  Good day for you.. and James it looks like!
893768,icefisherman,2015-01-24 00:32:00,952,"You got it Wayne...James is the mastermind behind the leg breakers ha ha ha....  Cheers, Ice Fisherman"
893769,Meegs,2015-01-24 00:41:00,249,If u can't see the blood around them as a warning sign then u deserve to break your leg. Lol
893770,irishfield,2015-01-24 00:44:00,26272,LOL James!!  Rob B stepped out of Lloyd's van a few years ago on Simcoe and missed one of those by a foot.. width of his foot !
893777,akaShag,2015-01-24 01:17:00,2073,"Yes those are big holes, but...................  ...........there was an older lad on the Bay of Quinte (dead now, God bless him) that used to spud holes about two feet square.  His gaff was a piece of two by four with about an eight inch spike through it, no such thing as catch and release.  And one time I visited him at home he had the BIGGEST walleye I ever saw in his basement sink in preparation for filleting it.  That walleye had to have been at least fifteen pounds.  My biggest ever was twelve, and this fish dwarfed that.  And he refused to take it and get it weighed....  Anyways, his partially frozen-over holes were man traps, and one of my buddies went down in one of them, both legs and up to his waist, scary stuff.  And by the way, what an awesome report!Doug"
893800,kenzy31,2015-01-24 03:28:00,261,"Fun fun morning...for you guys!! I missed all the action and had to settle for one 3lber around noon. Great report Ice And thanks for the K-9 transportation Back in Meegs, that ice was way slippery for the pooch. So she rode in a toboggan lol"
893804,Joey,2015-01-24 04:48:00,9122,"Another killer report Emil, you've got them dialed in that's for sure.  Whereas you like the whities, I hate them and prefer the laker. We may have to make a trade LOL"
