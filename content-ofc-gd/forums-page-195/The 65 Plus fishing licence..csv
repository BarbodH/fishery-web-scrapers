893793,KLINKER,2015-01-24 02:38:00,256,Anyone 65 and over has heard that Bull before.
893799,moxie,2015-01-24 03:25:00,1566,"Does this province turn out any politicians that don't come out of teachers college? "" I gots the tar nice n hot Thelma so you best be pluckin dem chickens sos I can introduce this Mauro character to a smidgen of the pain we in Ontarioz been feelin since him and his lots got in power"" . Optional? What a ""DICK"" move to even suggest this to those who have already blazed trails and paid their far share."
893802,bigugli,2015-01-24 04:06:00,6138,Gotta pay for all them pie in the sky promises  that politicians keep making.  Wynne liberals trying to find additional funds to pay for all them John Tory infrastructure promises for the GTA.

893821,moxie,2015-01-24 12:57:00,1566,  Love the double post

They're easy and very expensive targets who have the collective power to change education in Ontario instead of failing to educate our children while continuing to ask for more money at every turn for absolutely any reason. Then when they are lied to by those that they voted for  they punish us and our kids . Thats why. I got more if you want it."
893823,fish_fishburn,2015-01-24 13:09:00,1311,What I think has to be done is when you vote you choose independent. someone attached to no political party what so ever. all the parties act the same way when they get in power. Lies corruption and big fat expense accounts. Tow the party line or your out who cares what your constituents want. All the parties will tell you not to vote for independent so maybe there is a method to my madness.

Damn teachers, what did they do to you?"
893835,Mister G,2015-01-24 13:57:00,1429,Fishing was MUCH better when residents didn't have to possess a fishing license.
893838,John Bacon,2015-01-24 14:12:00,3277,"Fishing was MUCH better when residents didn't have to possess a fishing license.  Yeah, we got shafted on that deal.  The licences were supposed to provide extra funding for fisheries.  Now, the MNR gets less funding then they did before the licences were brought in."
893857,moxie,2015-01-24 15:24:00,1566,  That the best you have? Nord Bay educational district dropped the ball eons ago i see.

Do you know how many superintendents have never taught in a classroom, yet come in and tell the teachers they need to do more work and less play etc.  Teachers are like the nurses of the education system, and nurses have so much power right? If it is such an easy job to teach 30+ kids who have no respect for you because parents like you only bash them without trying to understand their current situation, then maybe you should try being a teacher, I bet you wouldn't last two weeks before you hit a kid who throws a book at you for no reason... Sure there may be a couple of bad teachers, but I have never met one who took out a bad government job on me.  The last strike was only to try and uphold democratic collective bargaining rights and they lost part of their pension and all of their sick days they had since accumulated.  But Whatever Moxie, all teachers are cruel monsters who are only out to destroy our kids futures right? lol Frankly, I don't understand why everyone teams up on teachers while Senators are getting cash handouts of twice their annual salary... I mean lets look at where the real problems in our governments lay Moxie... thanks for the insults though. Besides, this is a fishing board, so if you want to bash people's professions go find another board in my opinion, or keep it to fishing and fishing politics please."
893893,bigbuck,2015-01-24 18:24:00,2449,"What was the point of this whole thread??? O yeah, seniors licensing. More money to go into the nebulous hole known as general revenue."
893960,irishfield,2015-01-24 21:37:00,26272,When I was a kid the teacher was allowed to hit you for throwing a book at him.. and you NEVER did it again.  Now back to the government trying to get some seniors to anti up voluntarily! lol

I have Personally stop paying it. I can buy fish when I need it for much less. I don't think our fees are going towards our fishery management, and neverv has."
894005,Woodsman,2015-01-25 00:00:00,1286,I also don't think the funds go toward fishing but to the general fund. Also if you bought a conservation license you would have effectively reduced your catch & possession limit in half.
