894184,wormdunker,2015-01-25 23:10:00,1711,"I checked out Erie this afternoon in 3 different areas.  Ice as far as I could see but, extremely rough.  I wouldn't be able to walk it.  A sled or atv would be impossible!  Rough ice started right at shore & continued at least 2 kms.  Port Colborne, Pleasant Beach & Crystal Beach was terrible.  1 walker was coming off the ice at Crystal Beach & he stated the walk was brutal!!  2 groups were off Pleasant Beach fishing out 1 - 2 kms - I think a helicopter dropped them off.  The ice conditions were unlike past years where you would have large chunks of ice piled up near shore for about 300 meters then smoother ice beyond that.  I've never seen conditions like this before!  It's too bad cause I've heard reports of 6"" of ice out 3kms.  I don't know how he got there either??  In my mind Erie is a bust this year unless we get a thaw to smooth out the surface."
894189,Old Ironmaker,2015-01-25 23:50:00,8243,There are a few spots out here the giant icebergs haven't choked the shoreline. St. Williams is one. Many spots along Haldimand lakeshore is clear to get a machine in or walk out. I'll take a drive tomorrow and let you know exactly where.
894242,wormdunker,2015-01-26 11:53:00,1711,Thanx Ironmaker. I'm looking forward to your report.  I've been to Simcoe twice this year - it's a 2.5 hour drive 1 way!  Erie is so handy for me (Fonthill) but the conditions are brutal.  Hopefully more toward you is better.
894249,phiphntek,2015-01-26 13:01:00,115,thanks guys
