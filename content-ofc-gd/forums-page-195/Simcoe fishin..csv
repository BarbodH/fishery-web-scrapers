Hes only a young fella with little experiance but he got the hang of it pretty quick. He ended getting a handful of nice jumbos and we stayed on enough fish to keep him interested for a couple hours. I decided to try break my recent ice gator drought so i let him hit the perch and i started jigging a spoon, about an hour later i get a hit and its go time! Nothing special but it felt great to break the curse. All in all a great day on the ice, it was cool to see him having a fun day outside and hes already lookin forward to the next trip.im not going to post the pics of him cause i never asked so heres my wee pike.
