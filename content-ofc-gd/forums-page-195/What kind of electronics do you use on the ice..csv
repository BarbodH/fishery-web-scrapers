892146,bare foot wader,2015-01-14 17:49:00,1354,very happy with my LX-7
892194,Hellfish,2015-01-15 00:07:00,308,"So I bought the lowrance Elite 4 Hdi with the transducer, so I need to figure out how to rig it for ice fishing. I suppose I get a stick and run the transducer vertically down the stick, and obviously have the transducer at the bottom of the stick. From there does the stick need to be mounted on something so the transducer stays proper?"
892262,ctranter,2015-01-15 04:00:00,543,Got a lx9 for Christmas from the wifey and I love it... Tons of fun
892267,manitoubass2,2015-01-15 06:00:00,11391,You dont need a mount  drop transducer in hole and have at er
892290,wkrp,2015-01-15 14:27:00,656,When I upgrade my boat electronics I modify my old unit for ice fishing. Right now I am using a Lowrance X510C on the ice
892291,SirCranksalot,2015-01-15 14:34:00,3291,"You dont need a mount  drop transducer in hole and have at er  I think he ,means he bought the summer transducer. If so, he'll need to rig it up somehow. I have a rig for mine that I can post if need be."
892294,Hellfish,2015-01-15 14:46:00,308,"Yeah I have the transducer for soft water, is it possible to post a picture of your set up? I'm going to bass pro to get a battery or two so I just need to find a case and figure out how to rig the transducer"
892541,Fisherpete,2015-01-17 02:58:00,1814,Here's one way...  
892542,Fisherpete,2015-01-17 03:00:00,1814,...
892976,Hellfish,2015-01-20 00:21:00,308,"If anyone is interested I made a simple cross out of wood and mounted the transducer on the bottom. IMO it worked great, I got it out for a little test drive on a local canal and it worked out pretty well. I still have to fine tune it and what not but it worked pretty well!!! The elite 4 HDI has a lot of nice features in it, I think I can get used to this  Thanks for the input everyone it is appreciated!"
892991,porkpie,2015-01-20 01:06:00,2521,"When I upgrade my boat electronics I modify my old unit for ice fishing. Right now I am using a Lowrance X510C on the ice   How do you like the 510?  I just got a 527c with a boat package I bought, and I was wondering if it was worth buying an ice ducer and rigging it up for my son.  I have a new unit for the console, so this one is kinda surplus.  I'm using a bird 385 on the ice myself and its awesome.  Does your unit have a flasher mode?  The 510 looks to be pretty much the same as the 527 without gps.  Thanks for the input!"
892992,reelinrolly,2015-01-20 01:15:00,281,Never leave home without my FL8 Vex  Gonna upgrade to the 20 next year!!!
893014,c10,2015-01-20 02:30:00,131,"I just use my Humminbird 570 portable for Ice fishing, got it last year to replace the old one which sunk after the canoe flipped  , but it works great for soft and hard water so far, and for the camera I use the Aqua Vu 740c Series which also works great, haven't had an issue with either thus far!"
893030,Cosmos,2015-01-20 03:11:00,588,Humminbird 597 for me. It nice to have GPS with navionics with you.
893048,c10,2015-01-20 05:35:00,131,"I think I am going to spend some money on a GPS, but how do you like the 597 Costa? was looking at it, but got the cheaper version instead lol..."
893049,Barneybass,2015-01-20 05:35:00,14,"I use my Hummingbird 798 ci si unit on a utility box with battery and ice ducer and it works really good. I turn off the down and side imaging screens and use it with flasher mode or regular fishfinder mode depending on species. For Lakers the fishfinder mode is nice to see the history of what just happened like the streaks up and down...  It also has GPS with navionics mapping which is helpful for finding and marking spots.  Since you bought the Lowrance Elite 4 you could buy the Lowrance Ice Pack PPP 18 for about $150 which comes with the carrying bag, ice transducer, battery, charger and a few tackle boxes that fit into the bag. It's really nice."
893062,Cosmos,2015-01-20 13:13:00,588,"I think I am going to spend some money on a GPS, but how do you like the 597 Costa? was looking at it, but got the cheaper version instead lol... I am really happy with this unit. I am using it year around - from early spring to late fall in my boat, during winter in my ice pack. Unit is simple and easy to configure. GPS with Navionics is awesome. Strongly recommend it."
892021,Hellfish,2015-01-13 23:04:00,308,"Hey Gang I am curious as to what everyone uses on the ice for electronics. I am having a heck of a time finding either a flasher or a Fishable ready to go Ice fish finder, everyone seems to be sold out of just about everything. Seeing as I am in Niagara I am limited of local options but I am open for suggestions. I really like the features of the Lowrance Elite 4X, I can pick up the Elite 4x for $229 but then it is a $100 for the transducer and another 100 for the carrying bag which puts me up the Marcum VX. Very much a dilemma!!!! Helppppp!"
892024,grizzlybri,2015-01-13 23:14:00,565,"Keep an eye on the Classifieds, I was able to get a Humminbird ice45 (flasher) that was up for sale."
892025,Hellfish,2015-01-13 23:17:00,308,"yeah for sure, I have been looking. Procrastination really ends up biting me on the butt on this one . We booked a trip up to Haliburton and would love a unit before going up there."
892028,Old Ironmaker,2015-01-13 23:21:00,8243,A 20 year old Eagle Ultra portable. $100.00 for a bag to carry it? Come on man. For 50 bucks I'll carry it for you.
892030,BillM,2015-01-13 23:29:00,17367,Old HB 747c in the Humminbird portable pack and a hand help GPS (Garmin GPSMap 62)..
892031,Hellfish,2015-01-13 23:30:00,308,"How are the Eagles? This is really my first electronic and have no preference or experience with anything. I hear really good things about Marcum, Vex and Lowrance which all are the most expensive ones LOL. I really like the features of the Elite 4 as it can be used as a electronic flasher or a graph. I actually used a Vex once and it was great and that would be in the same price range of 350 as well."
892032,Hellfish,2015-01-13 23:32:00,308,A 20 year old Eagle Ultra portable. $100.00 for a bag to carry it? Come on man. For 50 bucks I'll carry it for you. LOL The bag was just a added bonus. But 229 for the elite 4 and 100 for transducer and 40 for the battery which puts me above the Marcum VX and the FL 28 which are both ready to fish. Anyone see anything the Elite 4x does over the Marcum? I do not have a boat so that will not be my determining factor.
892033,grizzlybri,2015-01-13 23:34:00,565,"when is your trip, before or after the sportsman show(Feb 5-8)?"
892034,DRIFTER_016,2015-01-13 23:37:00,10439,Marcum LX-5 is in my arsenal!!
892035,Hellfish,2015-01-13 23:43:00,308,"when is your trip, before or after the sportsman show(Feb 5-8)? it is before the last weekend in january"
892036,richyb,2015-01-13 23:47:00,774,i just use a portable humminhird pirannah that was about $120. You dont need to buy an ice transducer. Just make a bracket for the one it comes with.
892040,Pikeslayer,2015-01-14 00:17:00,1443,"Seeing as you're in Niagara:  http://niagarafishingexpo.com/ice-fishing-series/ Jan 23-25, Niagara Falls NY Check the show website & you will see there are a number of retail vendors there as well. Another member here and myself are attending the LOTSA Salmon School & Marketplace (new & used salmon gear & tackle) on Sat & Sun respectively. Even with the low CA $$, tackle, gear & electronics will still likely be cheaper??"
892044,Sinker,2015-01-14 00:28:00,8692,"You dont need anything fancy. Get the lowrance, and rig the transducer on a stick to put down the hole, and mount the unit on a small cooler or tool box to hold the battery. Works as good as anything.  I use an old lowrance X-96, or a hummingbird 570 portable. They both mark the same fish as the most expensive flasher, and do double duty on back lakes or rental boats. I have a permanant mounted lowrance with GPS in the boat.  S."
892045,chris.brock,2015-01-14 00:30:00,4053,"I use my old HB 565 portable on any boat I might be in, and on the ice. I've learned how to tie the transducer to the cable at the right angle for the ice.  Just curious, where are you headed in Haliburton?"
892056,Old Man,2015-01-14 01:09:00,822,Have you considered an online purchase? Our choices for equipment out here is limited and I've bought through both Cabela's Canada and Wholesale Sports online with no problems and quick service.  http://www.cabelas.ca/category/ice-fishing-electronics/2014  http://www.wholesalesports.com/storefront/home/fishing/ice-fishing/ice-fishing-accessories/c0-c20-c204-c204010-p1.html  Just a suggestion.
892066,Acountdeleted,2015-01-14 02:44:00,2562,I lucked out and got a Marcum Lx-1 for a good price. Watching Dynamic_bear use a hummingbird with an ice ducer last year and his flasher this year I really noticed the difference. I'll never hit the ice without it.
892071,Hellfish,2015-01-14 02:57:00,308,My wife and I are heading to Loreale (sp) cabins in Haliburton highlands I guess. We are fishing halls lake. Any suggestions for the lake Chris as I know you are from the area?
892073,Christopheraaron,2015-01-14 03:08:00,3525,Marcum LX-5 is in my arsenal!! Same here! Love that thing to death!
892080,chris.brock,2015-01-14 03:48:00,4053,"I'm not going to be much help. All I've got-  It's a super deep lake. I would still look for 60 to 70 FOW though. They stock it (the MNR has given up on the naturals?) but it's 1 line and slot size (the MNR hasn't given up on the naturals?). There is barely any huts out there and nobody walking out, compared to the neighboring lakes.  My best advice would be to chat with Dennis at Krista's Baits and Bites on Hawk Lake Road on the north end. He looks intimidating but he's a super nice and helpful guy who knows the lake well.  Post a report when you get back."
892081,Hellfish,2015-01-14 03:50:00,308,We booked a hut with Kristas on Halls lake I hope we get something for our efforts lol
892082,chris.brock,2015-01-14 04:03:00,4053,Nice!  You're in good hands.
892119,manitoubass2,2015-01-14 14:41:00,11391,lowrance elite 4x. awesome lil machine.  will easily fir in a lil work style lunch kit for 15-20 bucks
892122,Lunkerhunter,2015-01-14 15:03:00,455,spend the dough and get a proper unit. I have the vexilar flx 28 and love it. used to use the hummingbird ice 55 and it was good too. I prefer the vexilar though  the new Marcum units are very nice.  I would check with radioworld I am sure he will ship to you. I was in there last week lots in stock
892123,ckrb2007,2015-01-14 15:09:00,449,I use the Marcum LX-7. Sawweeet unit.
