Other operators are out but not many others fishing in the area.  Huts, equipment & service very good as usual.  Catching was a bit slow for me but given it was a social party trip and my electronics crapped out on the first morning, everything was good.  Caught some good sized perch with the largest 13 inches.  Threw back about 50% of what we caught.  Kept one herring to eat because we could.  Ironic thing, after seeing herring every time perch fishing for the last 5 years, only saw one large herring shallow that wouldn't bite and the one we kept caught off the bottom.   Ice surface was pretty rough with not much snow left.  Probably none after todays rain."
