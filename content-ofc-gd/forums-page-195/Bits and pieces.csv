The mobile ice hut project is under way!  Got the lawn tractor for free from a good friend that didn't need it any more (well actually prommised to fix his newer one for him) .  Met up with a guy, Larry McNish that has a snow machine salvage yard; what a nice young man, he has one sled that fits my needs and thinks he can find me another to match it without too much trouble and his price is VERY reasonable! Man, this guy has anything and everything when it comes to sleds  Then I talked to a very good friend of mine ""wiskeywizard"" because he is a genious at making and fabricating things and he is all over the two of us building one of these. Between the two of us we probably have every tool or a variation of it known to man (but our wives don't know that..... lets keep it that way!)  So, it is a pretty good bet that by next winter you will see a mobile ice hut putting around the Kawarthas!  Life is what you make it!"
