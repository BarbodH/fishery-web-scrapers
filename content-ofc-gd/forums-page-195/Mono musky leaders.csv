893557,esoxansteel,2015-01-22 19:01:00,1307,"Re crimps, i use High Seas as Lew mentioned make sure there rated for the line you choose, and also double barrelled, best to use swaging pliers to crimp, and i personally use 2 crimps at the swivel, and 2 crimps at the String ease cross lock,  i also tie as well using a Canoe Knot which Ron on the board showed me, and it will tie the heavy 150 pound as well  The big thing i have issues with on Floro is when it gets knicked from bagging rocks, its most likely still good, but i loose confidence at that point, and change leaders, making it expensive compards to mono, but ive fished with anglers who used knicked floro leaders without hesitation.  I have used Triline Big Game Mono, and its certainly softer then Floro in the same test, so i would assume the softer mono would allow a wider swing with a crank bait, instead of the stiffer floro, again its my personal opinion, and fishing comes down to personal preference and confidence"
893561,AKRISONER,2015-01-22 19:20:00,5558,"Yes  http://www.animatedknots.com/perfection/index.php?Categ=fishing  Awesome site matt, thanks  Also are you using the perfection knot for both ends? Seems like it would tie heavy fluro pretty easily."
893566,adempsey,2015-01-22 20:18:00,1498,"Nice knot, not sure why I've never used that before!    Do you guys tie on a swivel or direct to your lure?   I've never tied large test line before, so not sure if it's even reasonable to do out in 'the field'.  "
893570,muskymatt,2015-01-22 20:44:00,2608," Awesome site matt, thanks  Also are you using the perfection knot for both ends? Seems like it would tie heavy fluro pretty easily. Yes , both ends. You really have to get a good pull on them to cinch down with 200lb fluoro."

893657,Handlebarz,2015-01-23 10:52:00,3790,Like many others have said I use Floro for the confidence that it will hold up in a Muskies mouth if its in there it happened to me a number of times l we the years big fish just crushable bait next thing I know the line is across the mouth. So far Floro has not let me down in these situations.  I also make my own but have been buying the husky musky leaders the last few seasons the price is good for them.
893666,Raf,2015-01-23 13:50:00,3495,"i too use about a 3-4' fluoro or wire leader when trolling.  braid will get chewed up by rocks/zebra mussels, especially if you're making contact with bottom frequently -- that's the type of trolling i do where i fish.  if i were open water trolling like they do on st claire i would propably shorten them to 2'.  i personally wouldn't use mono but others do and have no issues so...... i don't see the action of a 8-12"" bait being affected by a stiff leader material at all.  we're not trolling little rapalas."
893677,outllaw,2015-01-23 14:36:00,1232,we use 5ft mono. use round end snaps also. the purpose is lets the bait walk stiffer kills bait actions. just check your leader running fingers down them for nicks. 5fters allow an inline weight to achieve great depths and allows the bait swing.
893680,Gregoire,2015-01-23 15:10:00,1397,"The leader will depend on the type of water you are fishing. Open water basin trolling, long mono would be fine, just check it after every fish. If you are trolling structure wire is a better option. I know this year I am looking into getting some 7 strand and using it for both trolling and casting tails. The one thing that I think is Bull is leader visibility. I do not worry about it."
893683,Roy,2015-01-23 15:36:00,13728,"The two things I don't like about wire is that most of them kink easily and if the fish rolls, you'll be cutting into its back."
893780,mike rousseau,2015-01-24 01:27:00,4661,"I once had a big fish roll in my 36"" leader then cut the mainline...  Now I use 48""...  I use the longest leader I can fit on the rod for the most part..."
893498,bobkayla,2015-01-22 14:48:00,148,"Hello all,,,right now I am using flouro for my leader material that I make myself. I'm am though getting tired of the crazy price they charge for the stuff. I am thinking of going to 150lb  mono which is a fraction of the price. I've never used mono before and worried about durability . Can't afford to be losing those expensive  lures . Any feedback would be appreciated"
893506,BillM,2015-01-22 15:06:00,17367,"Mono is pretty stout, especially if you're talking about 100-130lb stuff.  I wouldn't worry about using it for leader material."
893509,Gregoire,2015-01-22 15:10:00,1397,"I've used it. In my mind not much different than the fluoro. Never had a failure with it, and at the price can afford to swap them out quite often. I especially like them for some topwater lures. ."
893512,muskymatt,2015-01-22 15:23:00,2608,I've been tying my own leaders for years. Get a coil of 150-200lb fluorocarbon leader material and some 300lb swivels. I use the perfection loop and have never had a failure.

893514,muskymatt,2015-01-22 15:32:00,2608,"I've had fluoro leaders last for 3-4 years. When you factor in how long they last, I'm still on my first coil of 100' fluoro after 8 years, one can hardly complain about cost. Mind you I did win it on a Muskies Canada prize table."

(at least relative to flouro)   I used to put dry fly dressing on my mono when using big minnows for bait, it kept the line from sinking in the lily pads and weeds as the minnow swam thru them, you could see where your line was and how much slack was in it."
893527,lew,2015-01-22 16:14:00,12766,"I'm with Matt and agree that with the longevity of fluoro it actually makes them quite inexpensive. I make my own with 130 # Seaguar and crimp them and have never had an issue.  I only chase muskies 3-4 weeks a year now when I head north to Nippising but when I was pounding the water on a regular basis I'd make up new ones each year and keep the others as back-up.  I use around 8""  for jerk/twitch baits and then 18"" for casting and 48"" for trolling.  Not saying fluoro is better than mono as I've never used heavy mono for leaders, but I just prefer to use what I know works well and don't find them expensive at all.  All a personal preferrence though."

I make my own with 130 # Seaguar and crimp them and have never had an issue. Ive been interested in making my own leaders for a while now. I kind of like Fluro a lot more than steel, but at 10 bucks per leader it seems like a worthwhile investment. Plus, then i get to select the swivel id like to use. I find that the berkley pretied glued leaders are just way way overboard, the steel is as thick as the line.  I keep seeing everyone talk about crimping...any suggestion on products that you would recommend? Whats the best bang for buck and where to grab em?"

893537,captpierre,2015-01-22 17:43:00,2521,Hey Lew. Interested in why you use a 48 in leader for trolling Sounds like overkill but You Da Man as far as muskies go. Peter

893545,Gregoire,2015-01-22 18:09:00,1397,"Longer leaders for trolling does a few things:  1. Gives the lure more action 2. Gives much more snag resistance, as braid will cut very quickly along rocks. I learned this the hard way on pigeon, lost a perchbait. 3. Can give a bit more stretch on the strike, providing a better hook set (which also depends on the rod that you are using) 4. For those who believe it makes a difference, makes the line more visible.  I use long leaders mainly for the snag resistance, by that I mean that they are less likely to break if shagged on the bottom."

Interested in why you use a 48 in leader for trolling   Like anything else Peter, it's just a personal preference and just a length I find works well for me. Some guys use longer leads and some only use about 12"".  Ask 10 guys and you'll probably get 10 different opinions LOL"
893551,Roy,2015-01-22 18:21:00,13728,"My fluoro muskie trolling leaders are between 36"" and 48"". If tying your own, don't trim the tag end of the knot or loop at the mainline (swivel) end. Leave a half inch leg sticking out at perpendicular to the line. This will pick up any weeds headed for your bait and you'll be able to fish much longer between bait cleanings."
893552,Sinker,2015-01-22 18:38:00,8692,Why the longer leaders for trolling? I don't get that.  S.
893553,irishfield,2015-01-22 18:44:00,26272,"Roy covered it above... catches weeds and lets the bait continue to ""move"" in it's proper wobble. On Georgian bay with shoals and Zebra muscles the long leader helps with lost baits. 100lb power pro / stealth or what ever you are using will cut clean as a knife when it hits these shells instantly... the fluorocarbon or heavy mono leaders take a bit more abuse."
893554,lew,2015-01-22 18:46:00,12766,"Why the longer leaders for trolling? I don't get that.  S.  Mostly if your banging your baits along the bottom Shane, just keeps the braid away from the sharp stuff a bit better."
893556,Rich Nelson,2015-01-22 18:50:00,332,"Mono will work, but flouro is best for abrasion. Learn to tie a perfection loop, and stay away from the crimps."
