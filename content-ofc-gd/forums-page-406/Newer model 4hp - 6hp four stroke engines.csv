I had an early 2000's 6hp merc for a while and it ran great, but found that it was a bit noisy and vibrated a bit.  Some of the newer models claim to have better vibration reduction etc - so was curious if anyone had a 2010+ engine of this size and could comment on it. I'm thinking a Merc/Nissan/Tohatsu as they have through the prop exhaust. I don't think Honda or Yamaha has this and would assume they would be a bit noisier.  Going back to a single cylinder I know will obviously be a bit more lumpy etc, but for the 25lbs less weight and smaller footprint is what I'm after if they have improved the motors in recent times.  Thanks"
