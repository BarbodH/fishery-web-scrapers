697827,Christopheraaron,2012-05-19 19:05:00,3525,Tomorrow I will be heading up to the reservoir with a friend targeting pike (although panfish are always nice as are trout) he's not much of a fisherman and I would really like to get him into some fish. If anyone has any info on the reservoir or maybe the credit it would be greatly appreciated.  also I will be renting a tinny with a trolling motor.
697832,d_paluch,2012-05-19 19:31:00,343,Never fished it before but it's on my list of local lakes to fish. Let us know how it goes!
697833,Christopheraaron,2012-05-19 19:38:00,3525,"I know that it's supposed to be really good for bass and people say that there are a lot of pike, with weather like today it's going to be tough."
697878,bobowski,2012-05-19 23:39:00,360,I've only fished it in the winter on the ice. There are a ton of hammer handles in there. Biggest pike that i pulled out of there was around 25 inches. I've heard a few stories of some 40 inchers being caught.
697909,nlpaintballer,2012-05-20 01:32:00,122,"I've fished it a few times, my biggest pike was 32"" and a fiend of mine caught a 37"". Be prepared for a lot of weed growth, and people on the water. I have caught a lot of pike there, but very few over 24""  Again be prepared for weeds and stumps."
697921,Twocoda,2012-05-20 02:26:00,4130,If you renting a tinny and motor i would suggest the Credit...you can cruise up and down the river and wander into the Marina ....in the river youll get droppies and in the marina you should pull well....anything...good luck and enjoy
697946,Christopheraaron,2012-05-20 09:53:00,3525,"No, getting the boat from the CA so trailering it would not be an option."
697947,Christopheraaron,2012-05-20 09:55:00,3525,Would top waters work for pike this time of year or should I stick with the husky jerks and sb?
698008,salmon,2012-05-20 15:57:00,334,"Make sure you call ahead to reserve a boat for you. It will be busy I do not think there will be many weeds yet but in later it will be brutal. Head to the eastern end where there is a spot where it is the deepest @15-20 ft or so. Crankbaits, spinnerbaira and spoons work the best Jose"
698064,Christopheraaron,2012-05-20 21:40:00,3525,"Well, I'm home. Wasn't a very good day, worked pretty much the whole lake with spoons, spinnerbaits, jigs, crankbaits, and husky jerks. Got one little sunfish and perch, along with seeing a ton of largies. But it turned around when I headed down to the river, threw some spinners into likely looking pools and got some amazing action, had about 3 fish on in half an hour and because of the barbless regs all of them shook the hook, but I can't wait to get back."
698071,misfish,2012-05-20 22:16:00,29133,We like pics.
698073,Christopheraaron,2012-05-20 22:19:00,3525,"Of a sunfish, and a dink perch? Or is someone looking for backgrounds?  I'll tell you what Mis, for my next trip I'll include some pics; IF we get out some time this year!"
698076,misfish,2012-05-20 22:28:00,29133,"It,s a fishing board.Post little or big.  Many have."
698435,GreenCanada,2012-05-22 06:35:00,375,"Close to my (old) stomping ground!  I actually fish almost exclusively barbless. After fishing out West a bunch, where the regs require it, I decided that I didn't really lose any more fish because of the barbless hooks. Plus, it made releasing them that much quicker and with less harm, unless they were for dinner!  I did have a pretty thorough article kicking around somewhere that actually studied whether barbless hooks would cause more lost fish than barbed. I can't find the article, but I do remember reading that the findings found no statistically significant difference. I found it really interesting"
