697241,Rod Caster,2012-05-17 14:47:00,5784,Bahaha  What is the difference between normal bacon and bacon jerky? More salt?  I wonder what it would taste like deep-fried?

697254,jigsnreels,2012-05-17 15:32:00,133, How about bacon-wrapped deep-fried bacon jerky?  You know that's going straight to your aorta...
697257,jedimaster,2012-05-17 15:44:00,3472,Can it be filled with butter and then lightly floured before deep frying?
