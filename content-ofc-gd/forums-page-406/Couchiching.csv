697957,Dan668,2012-05-20 11:31:00,1120,It seems as if that ends really shallow. Would I be best to launch elsewhere?
698030,steverowbotham,2012-05-20 18:43:00,1800," Seconded if you want to go to the north end  If not, use the town docks in Orillia, fantastic launch"
698113,Dan668,2012-05-20 23:47:00,1120,From the north end I fished all the way to the dead island in the center. On the left hand side. Found very little weeds. Managed oos bass and tons of perch. No pike. Interesting lake. I'll probably fish it again next week. Only reason why I launched from the north is because it was the closest to me. The guys didn't want to drive further south
