I'd like to make sure my trailer tires last as long as possible (installed a new pair of radial tires last year) but I can't figure out an economical way to keep them covered and outta the sun.  I'd love to park it in the garage but it won't fit.  Any ideas from some of you industrious, frugal thinkers out there would be helpful.  Thanks."
