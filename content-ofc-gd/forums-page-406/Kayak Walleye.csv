697975,tbayboy,2012-05-20 12:58:00,1497,"Morning everyone.  I haven't done a report in ages it seems but hopefully I'll manage to get a few up this season.  Yesterday I got the kayak (ok canoe / kayak hybrid - whatever) out for its first trip of the season.  I headed out to Rice for some walleye fishing and finally got it all working.  For some reason I've never had good success on Rice but last week my wife and I managed a couple so I took what I learned from that and applied it yesterday morning.  I checked the map and had a couple spots in mind but it turns out that you really didn't need a map.  Every spot I was thinking of had a cluster of boats on it - I'm sure there's secret spots on rice but if your new to the lake just look for the other boats - at one time I had 3 rangers around me plus a couple lunds - they didn't outfish me though hehe .  Anyhow, I was on the water at 7:30 and off at 11:30 with dinner safely in the cooler (can't help but keep some eye's in the spring for the table).  Tried out a black and orange bucktail, a perch crank and a pink and white grub on a little thumper jig.  For some reason I've NEVER caught a fish on a bucktail jig and today didn't change that - I give up   The crank only got tossed a couple times when I was in the middle of an opening but the once I was near the weedlines it was the jig and grub using either a slow and steady retrieve along the weedline or hopped along the bottom near/in it that caught everything.  Didn't get any incidentals today which was a little odd but nice  - it was a walleye only morning.  Anyhow, I didn't have a camera but I had the go pro out so I put together a video of a few of them, hope you enjoy:   http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HqBTY_yS8o&feature=g-upl  Hope to see you all out there, enjoy the rest of this great weekend!  Sean"

697980,mike rousseau,2012-05-20 13:23:00,4661,"  did the same in kenora... i was up there doing a tree planting contract... me and a buddy bought a rubber dingy at canadian tire so we could get off the shoreline... within an hour there were 2 30,000 dollar lunds circling us cause we were getting more walleye then the 2 other boats combined...lol  its not the size of the boat that catches fish... its the angler...   great report"
697981,tbayboy,2012-05-20 13:30:00,1497, It's because I'm sitting down - yeah that's it.  Certainly not my fault

698000,Mike the Pike,2012-05-20 15:21:00,3421,That was great Sean excellent video.LIke the way you have the yak set up.  My son and I caught 6 yesterday jigging and drifting.  The wife and I are looking to buy some Kayaks for when we go camping as our canoe is not getting much use.  
698011,tbayboy,2012-05-20 16:28:00,1497,Hey Vince - which boat were you?  I'll be back soon - just need to earn some more brownie points with my wife
698012,tbayboy,2012-05-20 16:32:00,1497,Well the native ulitmate is reall more canoe than kayak but I like it that way -easy to stow everything in reach without getting wet.
698034,asdve23rveavwa,2012-05-20 19:11:00,2690,"Cool video, nice dinner"
698052,mercman,2012-05-20 20:33:00,7054,Awesome !!!!Gives it a whole different perspective being right down with the fish.
698056,Roy,2012-05-20 20:56:00,13728,"Excellent, Sean. So peaceful...reminds me of my canoeing days. Looks like a hearty dinner too!"
698114,Garnet,2012-05-21 00:11:00,2056,What color of black bucktail did you use.
698120,tbayboy,2012-05-21 00:46:00,1497,Black and Orange - I've tried black and blue and white and pink but no luck.  Just no good at ripping but swimming a jig - I'm in
698122,targaboy175,2012-05-21 01:01:00,76,"I was in the tracker targa ! Last boat to show up. I went up to rice this morning too! Fish still there. Matter of fact, I got more bite today than yesterday."
698160,Garnet,2012-05-21 12:27:00,2056,"I will say this again ""What color of Black do You USE"" not Black and ***** What color of Black"
