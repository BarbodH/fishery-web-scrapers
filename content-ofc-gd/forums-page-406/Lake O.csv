I wasn't expecting to catch anything but to my surprise I went 4 for 5.  One coho and 3 bows were caught between 120-150 fow where the surface temps were the warmest.  I had one rigger with cheater and one dipsey SD fly running.  The rigger got everything with blue/green/silver NK's down 60 ft.  It should only get better.   Cheers   "">"

G-& me were out off the south shore - , we had 1 laker and a bow today both off the rigger 90 ft down.   had 4 knock offs on purple NKs 250 back on the dipseys -- 2 of which were screamers...  Out again Monday.."
697889,trevy727,2012-05-20 00:01:00,351,I was out yesterday from Bronte and got 2 bows and 3 cohos all on dipseys back 150' over 150-200 FOW. Then I built a board for my riggers and went out again today and lost 2 off the riggers down 60' and got 1 tiny shaker. Beautiful weather both days. I'm loving the new boat.
