697578,lew,2012-05-18 15:04:00,12766, But he's still a heck of a nice guy Chris
697579,Spiel,2012-05-18 15:05:00,9065, True enough.
697614,misfish,2012-05-18 16:46:00,29133,  Me bad.  But I now have my fly fishing set up.
697623,Twocoda,2012-05-18 17:10:00,4130,do i owe you a buck now B....i missed it the first time through the ranks...but that was pretty kewl!
697712,Rizzo,2012-05-19 01:09:00,4754,ya I missed it too. Man those salt water fish can jump. Thing had to be 5 feet high and 15 feet distance. Guy reeling it in wasn't even paying attention at first that it was running at the boat
697715,Rizzo,2012-05-19 01:11:00,4754,watched it again...more like 7 feet high or more depending on how big that boat is!
