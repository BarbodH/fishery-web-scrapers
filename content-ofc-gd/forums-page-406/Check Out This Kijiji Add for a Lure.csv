698037,Fishnwire,2012-05-20 19:38:00,983,"Check out this add...  http://sudbury.kijiji.ca/c-buy-and-sell-sporting-goods-exercise-fishing-camping-outdoors-Heddon-Dying-Flutter-W0QQAdIdZ323511450  It has to be a joke, right?  That lure is worth about $10 new...with all the prongs on all the hooks.  If it is meant as a joke, it's somewhat funny.  If it isn't meant as a joke, it's downright hilarious.  I'm tempted to make him a low-ball offer ($12) just to see how it pans out.  If the guy is legit, I'd pay the $12 just to met him."

698045,bassman87,2012-05-20 20:03:00,586,...so you decided to make a thread about it
698059,Fishnwire,2012-05-20 21:13:00,983,  Yeah.  I think it's funny and thought a few others might too.  Obviously you don't...so you decided to post a response about it.

698063,kickingfrog,2012-05-20 21:30:00,8333,Not a real old colour.
698124,Fishnwire,2012-05-21 01:15:00,983,"  If you were as poor a fisherman as I, you'd probably better (comparatively) at what you do for a living too.  Since it's meant as kind of a self-deprecating joke, I'm not able (nor obligated) to prove it.  Thanks for noticing though."
