697774,danbouck,2012-05-19 12:41:00,4380,What is the best way to snag a walleye with a planer board?
697776,mike rousseau,2012-05-19 13:00:00,4661,Is there a punch line to that?  Or was that actually a question about planer board techniques for quinte walleye...?
697777,vinnimon,2012-05-19 13:03:00,2593,"Mike, I think he meant to say shag,lol"
697778,mike rousseau,2012-05-19 13:04:00,4661,  have to be an awfully big walleye or a really small planer board...lol
697794,fishhunter,2012-05-19 14:26:00,604,Small lure big trebles lol
697798,Mike the Pike,2012-05-19 14:33:00,3421,Dan I would not bother with planers this time of year.You are more likely to hook into a small walleye and you will never know it is on the board.  When are you going to the BOQ.I will be there next week for 4 days.  MTP
697802,danbouck,2012-05-19 14:39:00,4380,"Planer board + Small lure + massive treble = 8.6lb  Mike, I'm on the water now"
697808,lew,2012-05-19 15:00:00,12766,Fishing Quinte in May we always do well trolling after dark Dan.  Minnowbaits trolled in 8-10 FOW water over mud flats.
697823,vinnimon,2012-05-19 18:04:00,2593,Fp sauce on the lure seems to work the best .
697853,spincast,2012-05-19 22:39:00,3279,"Fishhunter day - somehow me thinks this is a bit of a tease... Good day out there guys? Sooo............... Juli, does the streak continue?"

697917,vinnimon,2012-05-20 02:00:00,2593,Lol
697922,danbouck,2012-05-20 02:28:00,4380,HAHAHAHA
697929,Mike the Pike,2012-05-20 03:04:00,3421,How is it going out there Dan?I heading back next week on Thursday.  MTP
698451,Stoty,2012-05-22 10:18:00,2910," I'm gonna have to disagree with that statement.... planer boards this time of year are actually a great bet to land a monster. It's not the boards, its the baits. Instead of trolling with ""banana baits"" (reef runner type baits), switch to more compact ""shad"" imitating baits in the spring. Literally 2 years ago this past weekend, I won a decent sized tournament on Quinte using CC Shads & Flicker Shads behind planer boards. And from what I hear, last year and this year of that same tournament were also won trolling crankbaits using planer boards."
