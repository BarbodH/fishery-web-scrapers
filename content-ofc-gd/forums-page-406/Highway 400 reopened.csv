According to Ontario Provincial Police, officers have opened two northbound lanes while traffic in southbound lanes remain at a standstill.  The truck has been removed from the southbound lanes, but officers are still on scene attempting to clean up a minor diesel spill and make repairs to the the guardrail.  Reports indicate the truck was heading north when it went through the guardrail and into southbound lanes before stopping sideways.  Police continue to investigate the collision.  The Highway 400 southbound ramp at Highway 89 has been closed and officers are on scene.  No injuries have been reported at this time."
697635,fisher,2012-05-18 18:06:00,451,"why is it always around highways 89 and 88?  As soon as I read your headline, I starting thinking ""I bet it is around 89""."
697636,davey buoy,2012-05-18 18:13:00,5505,"It always is,I'm thinking visibility like winter:whistling:.I travel that road weekly and I do not understand why it's always in that area. Had a call in Richmond Hill,took #11 home"
697638,fishingwithbob,2012-05-18 18:17:00,123,Open both ways
697645,lickmyarmpit,2012-05-18 18:46:00,359,"Just went through there still a mess, try another route clear past 89 northbound."
697648,NAW,2012-05-18 18:57:00,4022,"Not really related.  But I usually see about 1/2 dozen boats being trailored up North on the 400 every morning on my comute.  This morning, I counted over 50.  Anyone else getting excited for a long weekend of fishing and drinking cold beer!?"
697650,jimmer,2012-05-18 19:06:00,2730,It's so nice not to have to worry about traffic on a long weekend! Moving to the lake 26 years ago was the best thing I ever did. 15 minutes and I home and on the water!
697656,Jacques,2012-05-18 19:46:00,97,Anyone taken Sideroad 5?  Might be a good way to bypass 89.  Get off at 88 and then back on at Innisfil Beach Road or Essa Road?
697659,davey buoy,2012-05-18 19:55:00,5505," Yes,me!!!"
697661,Rod Caster,2012-05-18 20:15:00,5784, X2!
697664,DRIFTER_016,2012-05-18 20:22:00,10439,Right now there is only one spot of open water to launch the boat and it will be packed all weekend because of this!!!    :wallbash: The good news is there are a couple of small lakes ready to sink including one that produces fish like this one from last spring.    :good: 
697667,HTHM,2012-05-18 21:49:00,4082,I just missed it as I was running past that area 10 min before. Then on the highway through Algonquin park nearly hit a moose cow. PHEW
697676,danbouck,2012-05-18 22:35:00,4380,This literally happened about 1 minute after I decided to pull off to use a restroom. God bless dollar drink days.
697690,kickingfrog,2012-05-18 23:18:00,8333, Rye and ginger for me. Just signed the papers for a brand new highlander. Should have it in a couple of weeks. Then the boat shopping really begins.

697708,Rod Caster,2012-05-19 00:49:00,5784, The lakes are less busyon weekdays. I hope you get a few of those off instead!
697727,pics,2012-05-19 01:59:00,1268,Lots of midweek fishing means no traffic to fight either...trouble with that is finding a buddy with the same days off.....
697739,SirCranksalot,2012-05-19 02:31:00,3291," Well, I'm not one of your buddies, but if you want someone to fish with midweek let me know.----thx"
