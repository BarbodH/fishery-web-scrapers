697923,Mike the Pike,2012-05-20 02:47:00,3421,Well life sure has changed out of my three children only my son continues to come fishing with Dad.My 2 older daughters 15 and 17 no longer have interest in fishing. Thats ok though life is good.  Launched in Brossard not far from the Champlain Bridge on the South Shore of Montreal  My son Ryan  who is 13 he just loves it.I tell ya it was perfect day with the young lad.Hard to believe at 13 he is almost my height of course thats not hard to beat at 5 foot 9 lol  Today we went out late afternoon and stayed out for the evening bite.Was hoping to land some pike but did not find them.  I knew where to find the Walleye and we got in to some.Not monsters but the fish turned on.BTW Ryan out fished the old man even though I caught my PB Goby.  In all we caught 6 kept and kept  2 for the dinner plate .fish caught were only in the 14 to 18 inch range but we were catching thats what counts.  Here are some pix.             Leaving the Brossard launch   A shot from bay of Quinte almost 2 weeks ago what a difference in temperature.  Life is Good  MTP
697925,mike rousseau,2012-05-20 02:55:00,4661,Those look awfully tasty mike...  Glad you not so little fella still goes out with you... I hope my little guy likes fishing once he can hold a rod...
697926,limeyangler,2012-05-20 02:55:00,5204,"Nice Mike, what a great day out with the boy, really comes across in the pics...good times."
697932,mercman,2012-05-20 03:13:00,7054,Great report Mike and thanks for the tip. I love the sunsets off that dock.The wife and i often stand on the end of it and enjoy the view. We will find the Pike for you tomorrow and will PM you the location
697933,Mike the Pike,2012-05-20 03:16:00,3421, we trolled and casted along the shoreline where all the condos were but no pike.
697936,Rod Caster,2012-05-20 03:40:00,5784,Looks like a perfect outing with a free meal to boot!
697976,mercman,2012-05-20 13:02:00,7054," were you using spinnerbaits? Gonna try my secret weapon.If they work, i will make up a few for ya."
697987,Musky or Specks,2012-05-20 13:54:00,2710,Its s nice getting out with your son and having some success too.
698001,glen,2012-05-20 15:24:00,2641,Sounds great Mike.  Hoes the new rig working out compared to the ssv?
698003,asdve23rveavwa,2012-05-20 15:29:00,2690,"Thanks for the report, and, way to pass on the love for fishing"
698006,Mike the Pike,2012-05-20 15:35:00,3421," Glen after 5 seasons in my Lund classic it just keeps getting better.  This boat was built with the fisherman in mind.When I bought it I went all out.Air ride seats worth every penny.Sport Traks,Electric motor with auto pilot. etc...  The tiller provides me with so much room for a 16 footer.Now the SSV was a great boat but it was bare bones no livewell or comforts like the classic.It was lighter and got blown around a little more.  Only thing I miss about the SSV was its 18.5 foot length for connecting the waves but this classic its just an overall fantastic all rounded fishing machine.  Some people on here say you pay for the name Lund but I tell ya its built well and you won't find a 16 footer with a deeper hull than this model.  "
698013,tbayboy,2012-05-20 16:33:00,1497,Gotta be a loosing battle trying to keep teen age girls interested in fishing Mike but I'm sure they're happy you tried   Now please stop talking about your great boat - my life is giving me dirty looks after I told her how nice your was
698029,Roy,2012-05-20 18:37:00,13728,"Thanks for the great report, Mike. Really nice to see Ryan having a good time too!"
698094,Lungelarry,2012-05-20 22:59:00,294,"Don,t feel bad ,I was just down river from you and the pike fishin was tough,they wanted nothin to do with twitchin or spinnerbaits(sorry Paul) spoons were all they wanted.I snagged(by accident)and landed a 30lb. sturgeon."
