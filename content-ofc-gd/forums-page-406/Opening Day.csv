The plan is to go out for some eyes at 5 am. Have friends coming to town for the long weekend and they want to do a fish fry on sunday.  The boat has been ready for a good month now, I will be taking the g/f with me. The other two lads will be fishing out of there tinny. One doesn't know how to fish and the other has spent the last 25 yrs fishing Salmon on the salt chuck out west. Should be interesting to see how they fair out.  The river is at late july levels right now, so I'm hoping that makes things easier. Way less water usually makes it easier to locate fish but you never know being its the first day out. We will be jigging with worms and plastic grubs, as well as trolling some cranks. Minnows here are 5 bucks a doz which seems insane to me. No scoops here you get 12 for 5 bucks. Be safe out there everyone, the weather for the weekend couldn't be better."
