698010,mike rousseau,2012-05-20 16:16:00,4661,  But how do you get it from iTunes to a format on a USB that will play on the tv?
698014,DRIFTER_016,2012-05-20 16:36:00,10439,"Got to your iTunes folder on your computer and copy/paste the file to a usb stick. If it is in a format your tv doesn't have a codec for just use a converter like AVC to convert it to one it can play like MPEG, WMI, AVI.  iTunes data is located in the iTunes folder in your music folder/library."
