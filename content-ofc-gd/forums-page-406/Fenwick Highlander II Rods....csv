I've been waiting for them to come on sale since the last time they were.  I bought a 5 foot ultralight and 6.6 foot (both spinning) last time and was very happy with both until I broke the ultralight while bushwacking, and snapped off the tip of the 6.6 in the tailgate of my Jeep.  It feels good to have replaced both for around $100.  These aren't Loomis quality rods, but they're also far from the price of Loomis rods.  They're good for occasions (like bushwacking and tossing in the back of your Jeep) that you don't want to risk your good rods on.  For the price, you won't be disappointed."

Fishing straight down over deep water and with a super line I out fish everyone else in the boat....including my dog...LOL"
