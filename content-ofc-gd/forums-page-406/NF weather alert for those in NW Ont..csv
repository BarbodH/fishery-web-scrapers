697862,woodenboater,2012-05-19 23:11:00,2277,Hope lightning doesn't sparking anything up that way. Been years since I've been to Dryden.
697866,Old Man,2012-05-19 23:17:00,822," Me too. We are a lttle drier then normal, but not a tinderbox yet. Hoping for a good steady shower for the garden's sake. Environment Canada had forecast 25mm by now, my guage is only showing 3mm. Hope more is on the way."
