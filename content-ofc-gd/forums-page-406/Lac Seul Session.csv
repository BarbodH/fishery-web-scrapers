I knew a couple of the lads camping at the landing and right away they warned us the bite was slooooooow!  I had kind of anticipated a 'tough' day because of  the wacky weather we have had this year it was gonna be anyones guess where they were.  I did try conventional wisdom that they would still be shallow.....they certainly were still shallow on my home lake....but then again my home lake does not really get more than 35'FOW.  We started off shallow...and after a good couple of hours and enough pike slime to make even an American sick (lol)i remembered that the year before last we had also had an early ice out and discovered the fish on their deeper summer haunts by opener, i even remembered catching a few whitefish that year.   So we headed off to my deep water spots with low expectations but renewed hope. Not long after anchoring up on the I-pilot we started to get 12""ers out of 30-38'FOW. The action was steady with a steady increase in size upto some nice slot size fish.   However the slot size fish were scarce and the over slot size fish non existant, so we moved on to another 35' FOW reef i know. Straight away normal service resumed...and at last Havtaflyfish got into a nice 26"" Lac Seul hog...followed by a 21""er shortly after.  Even better was we both got into a whitefish....they fight awesome on open water too.   I counted 43 seperate clips of fish caught for the video and i say i probably did not film about 20 to 30 fish caught. So....all in all a good numbers day but the big ones eluded us. One of the 21"" males we got in 39'FOW had the ole sperm flow goin still.....but that was the only sign of spawn activity we saw. I'd say they are done...surface temps between 54F(main lake) and 62F(sheltered bays).   We got an excellent limit in the cooler of 17"" walleye....man are they chunky munkys...really solid fish.   When we got back to the landing the boys camping there wasted no time telling us they had landed a 28""er right from shore in about 5'FOW....guess they are shallow too and we were just not in the right shallow areas!  Water level is way down on....stumps iknow showing an extra 4-5' above water line.  Near the end of the day the wind picked up and the fish all but disappeared/stopped biting on the deep reef...we moved back to the other deep mark where it was shallow and got our last 2 fish for the cooler in 23'FOW before heading home.       <iframe width=""560"" height=""315"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/He2-wpfHUf0"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>                               "
