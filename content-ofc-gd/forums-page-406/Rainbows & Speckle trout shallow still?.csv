697217,BillM,2012-05-17 13:37:00,17367,"If I was going back to the lake I fished a few weeks ago, I'd be bringing in some live leeches!  Fish were keying in on leeches and big dragonfly nymphs..."

697533,singingdog,2012-05-18 11:07:00,1047,"I imagine they are still shallow: lots of cool nights are keeping the water temps relatively low. Ditto on the leeches: a jig with a black zonker strip is good if you don't do live bait. Otherwise I would go spoons for specks, with lots of pause-and-flutter on the retrieve."
697536,Christopheraaron,2012-05-18 11:16:00,3525,How much longer do you think they'll be there?
697567,BillM,2012-05-18 14:13:00,17367," All depends on water temp... Brook trout are constant roamers anyhow, it's not like they sit in one specific area."
697763,singingdog,2012-05-19 10:28:00,1047,"Don't get fooled by surface temps, especially with specks. A couple of years ago we were on a great speck/laker lake in late May. Surface temps were 72 F. We caught fish all day, mostly lakers, 7' down. That 72 degree water was only about 2' thick."
697796,Bob,2012-05-19 14:30:00,370,"Most years here, we flat line for lakers until near the end of June, sometimes into July. Specks and rainbows don't go very deep at all."
