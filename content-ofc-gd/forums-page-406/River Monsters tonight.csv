698326,Weeds,2012-05-21 23:07:00,782,"I just noticed it's on tonight (Discovery Channel at 10) and as I know the show has a few fans here so I figured I'd give a heads up. Filmed in ""America"", it would be cool if it were on Musky. I don't want to get anyones hopes up though, any fish could be the focus, it could even be an old one fimed in South America."
698328,davey buoy,2012-05-21 23:11:00,5505," They had a marathon on discovery today,last one from 7-8 tonight."
698331,Weeds,2012-05-21 23:19:00,782, So the one from 10 to 11 is a repeat? Any Musky?
698333,davey buoy,2012-05-21 23:21:00,5505," Didn't watch many,no musky from what I saw. Most repeats,your right.The one at ten does not give any info."
698337,Pigeontroller,2012-05-21 23:32:00,2793,I'm thinking its only a matter of time till Mr. Wade is fishing for Muskie on the St.Lawrence...
