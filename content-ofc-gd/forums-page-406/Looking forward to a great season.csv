Had to move around but managed to locate them with limits for all(mostly minnies in around the 25' mark) . Averaged around 10/11"" with some 14 and 15. Had time to drag some harnesses over a few of my spots on the way in and managed to add a couple of eyes to the menu. Looking forward to a great season! "
