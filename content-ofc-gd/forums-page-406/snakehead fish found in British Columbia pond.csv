697785,jigsnreels,2012-05-19 13:31:00,133,Should have bashed it with a rock instead of filming it.  Same goes for whoever threw it in there.
697795,Christopheraaron,2012-05-19 14:26:00,3525,"Bashing it with a rock wouldn't work. I was given a newspaper clipping from a teacher once who knew about my ""condition"" (fishing), about the Frankenfish, they tried keeping it out of water for a few days, clubbing it, and even freezing it. They couldn't kill it. just some food for thought."
697842,aplumma,2012-05-19 21:17:00,6896,No They can be killed real easy a stout wack in the right place or a screwdriver in the brain they die from trauma the same way any fish will. Left alone with a damp environment then they will hang on for a good while. I have killed over a dozen of them and keep a few alive for 3 days in my livewell with no aeration.   Art
697844,Christopheraaron,2012-05-19 21:33:00,3525,Take a screwdriver to the brain and that will kill anything!

698004,aplumma,2012-05-20 15:29:00,6896,I don't know you got to hit the brain to kill them......   Art
698007,Grimace,2012-05-20 15:47:00,2020,I would take care of a snakehead the same way that I take care of zombies.  Separate the head from the body.
