698175,Beans,2012-05-21 13:45:00,3339,Some of the carp anglers over in the UK still wear a tweed sportscoat with patched elbows and a tie...
698180,Christopheraaron,2012-05-21 13:55:00,3525,"I gotta say that that's just rediculous. If some guy does show up at the stream, pulls a one piece rod out of a garbage bag, and puts on some camo waders, ya he's not going to look the part. But if your standing upstream all dressed up and he starts out fishing you, your going to feel pretty stupid!"
698183,Roy,2012-05-21 13:58:00,13728, When that's the only clothes you have.....the fedora is a nice touch too eh?
698191,Jet,2012-05-21 14:46:00,364," Thanks for the fix. Indeed Roy I had a good laugh at the comments, especially when the author had to explain the article to some readers!"
