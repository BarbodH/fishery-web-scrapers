697949,Roy,2012-05-20 10:00:00,13728,"It's really great to see all the heavy hitters stepping up to the plate. I can see this being a difficult choice for Simon....as the man once said "" you say yes to one and let the other one ride, it's not often easy, it's not often kind. Did you ever have to make up your mind"" This kinda sounds like a Simon and friends get together. Wish I was closer."
