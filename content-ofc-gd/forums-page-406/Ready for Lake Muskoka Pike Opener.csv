698145,bigbuck,2012-05-21 11:11:00,2449,We were 3 for 4 on Saturday.  The weather was unbelivable. The fishing wasn't great. We landed 3 fish which was enough for a fish fry yesterday afternoon. Good time with old friends.

All of us except 1 of the group are married and most have kids now so the nature of the trip has changed from a weekend of partying with some fishing to a weekend of fishing with some partying. Good times."
