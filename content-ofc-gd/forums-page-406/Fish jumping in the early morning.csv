698089,Skipper D,2012-05-20 22:51:00,1970,Its awsome what's learnt when you ask a question here .
698091,davey buoy,2012-05-20 22:52:00,5505, Didn't think so either.
698093,Skipper D,2012-05-20 22:57:00,1970,Will herring ever be open on simcoe one day ???????????
698095,Terry,2012-05-20 23:07:00,14456, yes  I think if they get one more strong year class they will open it not like before maybe somewhere between 2 and 5 fish limit or tied in with whitefish
698100,Skipper D,2012-05-20 23:20:00,1970,"Thanks Terry , heres another one i'll thro out for an answer , was any one here today part of what seemed to be a fishing party of about fifty boats just north east of Fox island , i spent a bit of time in amongst them but did'nt see any one catching much , finder read 82 fow , every one was jigging ."
698102,Terry,2012-05-20 23:22:00,14456,that is the top secret whitefish spot
698103,misfish,2012-05-20 23:22:00,29133, Smelts.
698107,Skipper D,2012-05-20 23:38:00,1970,"Now that i know what that spots for , i wont have to look for Brian's ........ lol ."
698109,misfish,2012-05-20 23:39:00,29133,:rofl2:
698110,Skipper D,2012-05-20 23:44:00,1970,"I don't think any one has to worry about me out there , if it can't be caught on a perch set up am out of there ."
698131,northernpike56,2012-05-21 02:08:00,717,"I have a little 1.5 or 2"" rapala popper lure, I have caught just about everything on it. LM, SM, hammerhandle pike, even a few crappies! it was about $8 but well worth it in my books. I would really recommend you get something similar. oh yea I have also caught a rainbow trout on it."
698190,steverowbotham,2012-05-21 14:41:00,1800,"Herring, I see them on the surface all the time out there, especially in the morning and evening hours"
698235,Skipper D,2012-05-21 19:11:00,1970, Thats because they go south for the winter Sinclair ...... lol
698236,Carp,2012-05-21 19:11:00,1488,"Fly rod might be a good choice for catching those surface feeders, but if they're herring, there's no open season, so targeting them could get you in some doo doo !"
698240,Skipper D,2012-05-21 19:24:00,1970,"  doo doo OFC of the worst kind ........ lol.  Never the less its nice to see the lake alive like that out there in the early morning , helps get the blood pumping for the day thats ahead ."
698028,Skipper D,2012-05-20 18:34:00,1970,"When i headed across the bay out to the lake this morning shortly after five ,  there were fish jumping on top the water every where . First off i'am unable to tell you what kind they were as i don't know all the differant fish species and their habbits yet , but i ure would like to know which kind they were and if i should have stoped to fish them had i known  . I figured since they were on the top i would need a top water bait to catch them and thats some thing i have none in my tackle box . Can some one enlighten me a little here , and thanks in advance"
698040,mercman,2012-05-20 19:46:00,7054,Probably minnows or shiners eating the bugs on the surface of the water.  So did ya catch anything?
698041,dave524,2012-05-20 19:52:00,4508,"If they are real big, could be carp spawning in the shallows, time is right, they jump frequently during this ritual. Seen a few post with huge mayfly hatches coming off, maybe something is after them."
698044,misfish,2012-05-20 20:00:00,29133,"How deep was the water? With the hatch,it could of been minnows,smelts and even herring. If they are large fish,they could be  carp like mentioned.. I have seen it many times in the early morning when boating out of the bay.   BTW You werent out there looking for the back ground in my vids were ya?"
698051,Billy Bob,2012-05-20 20:32:00,5865,Most likely carp rolling on the surface......they do that just about every morning....if it's calm you notice it.
698055,misfish,2012-05-20 20:50:00,29133," BB The bay here is deep. Once you get out past Minets point,your in 90-100+ fow all the way out. The shoreline has at best 50-80 feet is 10-30 fow,the drops fast. I have a spot that I have seen them jump and splash around in 30 or so fow. Nothing deeper then that. My moneys on the herring,if it,s out in the deeper waters."
698060,mike rousseau,2012-05-20 21:20:00,4661,I've seen carp spawning on the surface over 80 feet of water...
698061,Christopheraaron,2012-05-20 21:27:00,3525,"Get a simple popper or something like that, just have it ready when you see that, chuck it over catch one and see if it's worth fishing for."
698067,12footspringbok,2012-05-20 22:13:00,459,Its herring they surface all day long feeding and such. No season on them on simcoe.
698068,misfish,2012-05-20 22:15:00,29133,"  Thanks.  Were out again in the morning. If I see it,I,ll try and get a vid or pic."
698069,Christopheraaron,2012-05-20 22:16:00,3525, Are they good fighters?
698070,Skipper D,2012-05-20 22:16:00,1970,"  They were to big to be bait , did i catch any fish today//// released arouund fifty , brought homw seventeen keepers ."
698072,Skipper D,2012-05-20 22:18:00,1970,  I beleive there is no carp in Lake Simcoe ...................
698074,Christopheraaron,2012-05-20 22:20:00,3525, Ohhhh yes there is!
698075,Skipper D,2012-05-20 22:24:00,1970,"  Then you've seen it too , you know how deep the middle of the bay is then , what you see is only the backs of the fish so its hard to tell . I could'nt understand why the other boats that went out ahead of me this morning did'nt seem to notice   , i actuly stoped andd tryed fishing them but i knew i'd get nothing cause of not  haveing any top water baits with me ."
698077,misfish,2012-05-20 22:31:00,29133,"  Like said,herring Ron. When I use to launch out from the ninth,I seen it alot.Differrent size/classes. It is pretty cool to see."
698078,Skipper D,2012-05-20 22:34:00,1970,  Where abouts ???????? i have never seen them in Kemptemfelt bay .
698080,davey buoy,2012-05-20 22:37:00,5505," They must be in Kempenfelt?,but I see loads in cooks bay. Rolling and eating whatever is in the floating weeds."
698081,bassman87,2012-05-20 22:42:00,586,some of the biggest carp ive seen were in simcoe
698082,davey buoy,2012-05-20 22:43:00,5505,The ones in the south end are huge!!as well.
698083,misfish,2012-05-20 22:44:00,29133, Barrie Marina.
698085,Skipper D,2012-05-20 22:47:00,1970,"  I agree its probaly Herring , carp rise their backs up out of the water , thease seem to roll just below the surface  exposing very little of them selfs . I'll say i have my answer and thank every one for helping ."
698086,RickOnt,2012-05-20 22:48:00,669,"Skipper  There are Carp in Simcoe for sure!  usually in shallower water, I think what you are seeing, as has been said, are ""Herring"""
698087,aplumma,2012-05-20 22:48:00,6896,I will toss out gar fish they will roll in deep water.   Art
698088,Terry,2012-05-20 22:50:00,14456,none on simcoe
