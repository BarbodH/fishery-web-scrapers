697546,Harrison,2012-05-18 12:18:00,2202,I agree with who ever mentioned a tinny with a 20 to 40HP.  More bang for your buck.  Find something with a high deck and you'll be good to go.  For that budget you'll end up with a 1982 glass boat with the same yr motor.  You are better off waiting until you have 10-15g's to spend on a bass boat.  IMO.  Then you'll buy a 18ft and the next year you'll get the 2footitis and want a 20ft.  It's a vicious circle!
697547,jedimaster,2012-05-18 12:21:00,3472,"Don't forget in the states there fishing season isn't 6 months long... There boats run all year... Don't mislead the guy usage. You will use less gas if you don't flog it around obviously. But at half throttle cruising all day in a bass boat with a likely 15 year old or more motor in the 115-150 r range versus a 16 foot tin boat with a 30 or 40 hp motor the gas price jump is pretty stagering. I spend all summer in both and there is a reason I prefish in a tin boat and not a bass boat. And its not for the fun of it. Also towing costs are significantly higher with a heavier boat. Anyway, he is gonna get a bass boat cause that's what he wants and that's what he should get. Its just an fyi that really likely doesn't need to be said, a bass boat eats mor gas than a lot of other boats out there."
697558,grimsbylander,2012-05-18 13:03:00,3016,"  The boats from Pennsylvannia, New York, Ohio, Illinois, etc. do not run all year and it is still the states. The prices there are very different than here. Hours are hours regardless of where you buy it. The post was looking for a bass boat."
697566,danklegrand,2012-05-18 14:09:00,55, X3 on this one.  Excellent post.
697576,jedimaster,2012-05-18 15:03:00,3472,"For 5k, I doubt he is gonna find a boat with a working hour meter. once yuo get into the sunny states further down they will have more hours on them than a comperable boat up here. Just something to look out for. If I was buying a boat I would certainly be doing it in the states though. check the boattrader.com site. It will give you a rough idea of what you can find...

697582,DRIFTER_016,2012-05-18 15:12:00,10439,"Just an FYI. Bass boats come made from aluminum too!!!! Best of both worlds really. The lower weight of aluminum, better gas mileage out of a smaller engine and the fishability of a glass bass boat. Sure, they aren't as slick and pretty looking but I have found that they get on plane faster and stay on plane at slower speeds which is really nice when the water is really snotty!!! Way better than beating the crap out of your kidneys trying to keep a glass bass boat on step so you can see over the nose."
697651,lookinforwalleye,2012-05-18 19:11:00,4399,"For what its worth I did a little research on boat trader and yes there are good deals to be had in the states but in my case there is no way you get my boat with a 75 OPTI for 12.5K in the States, most come with the standard 50 hp smoker for that price!!!  Thanks for the plug Landry!"
697654,msp,2012-05-18 19:35:00,1336,I agree 100 % A boat like this will sip fuel. Get a 4 stroke and its even better. Not to mention the light weight towing which will also save you in fuel. Fiberglass is very heavy for towing

697731,Garnet,2012-05-19 02:04:00,2056,You should be looking in the U.S.  Things  Good trolling motor. $1000 to $1600 Good electronics 2@  $1000 to $6000 Battery's about  $100-170+ per battery. You need 3 and 4 if 36 volt trolling motor. Buy a $49 load tester and learn how to use it.  Buy a compression tester Princes Auto $15. You take all the plugs out screw the compression tester in each cylinder and record. The rule is 10%. Most older motors will be in the 97 -100 if 1 or more are different by 10% leave it.  Have large strait screw drive and pull lower unit oil screws. Lower unit has a very distinct smell anything else run. If white or water it's not a deal breaker $500 - 600 at a shop. Small fillings is normal lot's or chunks is bad.  Take cowling off look at all bolts for signs of wrenches. Head bolts marked it's been apart. Look at recites for quality job. No machine shop work it was a hack job.  Turn steering from lock to lock. If they are cable steer and stiff $300 for cables + installation. I would leave a cable steer the are a bear to drive.  Look past faded Gelcoat that can be buffed up like a new penny. De lamination is costly.  Give the lower unit a real hard shake up and down. Watch transom for movement and look between lower unit and transom. That down tube is full of bearings. Any slop and it's huge dollars to fix.  Theirs more just tired.

I was wondering g if you guys could give me a hand.  I Am looking for 18 ft  with trolling motor, fish finder, live well ,  rod storage  First off, when looking for a boat what are some tell tale signs of a lemming. I don't know a great deal about boats and want to make sure I don't buy a money pit  Second of all does anyone know of any good websites I should be looking at?  I have a budget of 4000-6500.  Thanks in advance!!!!"
697334,jedimaster,2012-05-17 19:49:00,3472,Bass boats are money pits. The gas is terrible compared to other styles of boat out there. For 4000-6500 you are gonna be in tough to find one with a recently newish motor. I know a guy selling a nice one for 8k though if your interested shoot me a pm I'll pass on his info.
697339,aplumma,2012-05-17 20:16:00,6896,If you are looking at Ranger boats look for 1989 or newer that was the the first year they removed all of the wood in the substructure so you will not need to look for wood rot in the fiberglass portion of the boats. The motor they came with in some cases are the Johnsons and they are still maintained to an extent thru third party and factory parts. I have the 150 gt series and it is still running strong with a few worn parts replaced over the years.   Art
697343,Gerry,2012-05-17 20:28:00,257," Now that's a whole lot of nonsense. Bassboats are actually better than deep V types and other heavy designs. Bassboats skim the surface of the water thereby reducing drag. Having owned one for many years I can attest to this with absolute certainty. My current boat is much less fuel efficient due mostly to the weight and design.  Now, as far as not wanting to buy a ""money pit""......well, for $4,500 to $6,000 range you will likely do just that. Have you priced a new one in the size that you've mentioned? They are probably running in the high $20Ks to low $30K range, or more. If a guy (or lady) is letting theirs go for $5K, they've probably used it all up. I'm assuming of course, that you're thinking of getting the motor with it."
697374,Snidley,2012-05-17 21:56:00,620,"Boats in general are expensive items to maintain, money pits if you will, but cheap used boats fit into this statement. ""If you can't afford a new Porsche then  you really can't afford a used one'. Same saying goes for cheap motor boats and cheap baitcast reels. Avoid cheap anything especially if an internal combustion engine is involved."
697393,bigmac1984,2012-05-17 22:30:00,193,"BOAT stands for Break Out Another Thousand.... referring to dollars of course.  I heard that from a guy recently and it is about as close to the truth as there is!....  Another suggestion is to look at marinas or dealers around where you live. Typically if you buy something from them, they are more likely to be of better service to you down the road."
697400,landry,2012-05-17 22:48:00,1005,"There is a great looking bassboat for 12,500 on this site's boat classifieds. I have seen that same model on the water - fast and very functional. I also bought a icehut from the seller and he was a good guy - and a longtime board member here. A 6000$ bassboat will likely cost you the same as that one in the end somehow. Sometimes you get lucky though - I bought a 16 year old boat that was cheap to run and very reliable. My neighbor has a newish 4 stroke merc that has broken down twice on him in the last year??!!

697411,misfish,2012-05-17 23:04:00,29133," Wow,I guess you know eh?  I am one that bought a 87,18ft Ranger with a 89,115 Mariner,what 6 years ago or so. I paid $7500 for it.Great deal. Bought,and dropped in the water and off I was going. Put an upgrade bow mount.200 bucks. Replaced one livewell pump(left running over night after a tourny  me bad:wallbash: ) 65 bucks.Two upgraded deep cells,and one cranking battery.(got a deal on them, three for 130 bucks) Bought some clear coat spray and wet sand paper for the trailer fenders,40 bucks. Ran that boat for 3 years.All of them for tournys and fishing Simcoe waters. Gas and oil was all I spent on the boat after that. I lived my passion,and sold the boat for $7000.  I say I did well,and lived out a dream."

697424,mike rousseau,2012-05-17 23:30:00,4661,Your budget is WAY off for a bass boat...  For that price youd have to really shop for a decent 16 foot tinny with a 40-60 hp motor...
697427,jedimaster,2012-05-17 23:34:00,3472,"A bass boat is a fairly effecient hull design, however the motor sizes and weight of the drivers arm will burn a hell of a lot more gas than most boats other than a big cabin cruiser. My 18 foot bowerider with a mercruiser was way better on gas than the bass boats I had. As is my 16 foot llund with a 30. So if you hae 5k to put into a boat most other boats will save you on the pump."
697440,ecmilley,2012-05-18 00:12:00,2163,"I would be over on bass boat central to do research, you'll be hard pressed to find any quality brands in that price range that arn't a basketcase in canada but other than that what to look for, check for cracks in the flake, check for cracking in the transom, make sure all electrical works and what the electronics are on it, make sure all compartments open and close easily, steering cables  make sure there free age of the batterys. compression test of the engine, check lower unit oil for water contamination trim tilt operation and make sure you can do a water test to make sure the boat runs properly"
697443,misfish,2012-05-18 00:25:00,29133," With the 115 being a 2-4 split,I could prefish a whole day for 20 bucks or so. Keeping the motor at 3200-3400 rpms all day.When I made a run,it would get maxed to 5400-5500. Thats when it sucked the fuel. When fishing a tourny, it,s different. If you are out just coasting around,your pocket book wont take a big hit. But once you feel the power,you,ll be punching the throtle,for awhile ,til you learn to back off.LOL  Good points E."
697461,aplumma,2012-05-18 01:01:00,6896,I run a GT150 340 Ranger built in 1989 and it fished 5 days in Canada on 25 Gal of fuel. Granted I didn't floor it often because it will dump 4/5th of a gallon per min. at 56 mph. I kind of relate it to driving a V8 lots of muscle when you need/want it but it can be babied and get surprisingly good gas mileage.   Art
697468,bobkayla,2012-05-18 01:09:00,148,"the gas milage is not bad if you keep the rpm low like stated,,,,,good luck,,,,but you won:t get much of a boat for that money"

Not all older boats that are sold at good prices at all beat up like some guys are saying. You can get a great boat, even a great bass boat, for very close to your budget if you don't rush."
697498,NBR,2012-05-18 02:28:00,163,"I bought my first bass boat used had it for 7 years and sold it for about the same as I paid. I did fix a lot of small things and I cleaned it up a lot and replaced/upgraded a prop that got too close to a rock. Yep, bass boat use a lot of gas but then so do all boats. If you read boat reviews most carbuerated rigs get around 4.5 mpg at 4500 to 5000rpms run faster and the mpg drops put put along and the mpg sinks to very little since you are pushing all that water out of the way.

697538,grimsbylander,2012-05-18 11:37:00,3016,"  Exactly.  I think the biggest contributor to the cost is the simple fact you can do so much more. I don't hesitate to make a 15-30 km runs and I absolutely go faster than I need to...when just fishing casually. If I fished the same way as I did previously, meaning same distances from the launch and at the same speed, things would be much different. It would still be more expensive, but much cheaper than now.  Oh, and you really should look hard state side for that boat. I'm not saying they don't exist here in Canada, but your odds are much better south. If you shop now with the intention of getting one by the fall or next spring, you'll get what you want."
