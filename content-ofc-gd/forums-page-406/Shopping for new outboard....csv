697881,Billy Bob,2012-05-19 23:43:00,5865,I just mentioning that brand as my Johnson is 27 years young and still going VERY strong......how whatever you decide it works out the best for you.......
697886,mike rousseau,2012-05-19 23:58:00,4661,  my dad/brothers ranger has a johnson 115 tiller and that thing is amazing...crazy quiet and trolls really slow for a motor that size...
697888,Billy Bob,2012-05-20 00:01:00,5865,"Mine is far from quiet compared to today's outboards.....but strong as a mule......and trolls right down to 1.5 mph....  I am really surprised that your having that much trouble with that Honda....it's really not that old in my eyes.  Again, good luck........  Bob"
697894,DRIFTER_016,2012-05-20 00:18:00,10439,"I stopped in at my local Merc dealer today cheking on price dirrerences between a 90 and 115 four stroke. Pricing is way high here but it gives me an idea of the cost differential. I am looking to purchase in Alberta and have it shipped North. I will still save enough that the kicker and controls will be free compared to cost if I bought locally. Cost here for a 90 Merc is $11,250 and the 115 is $13,400!!!! That's a lot of cake for a mid sized motor.  If I buy in the South $14K gets me new controls, smartcraft guages, 115 4 stroke and a 9.9 4 stroke and shipping to Yellowknife."
697961,krixxer,2012-05-20 11:54:00,274,"Don't buy, LEASE IT. When you lease you can amortize it quicker and all the interest is a business expense. If you buy you only get a small % of depreciation.  When I need major equipment for the shop I use an independent co to finance everything form a new air compressor to air make up units. In the end it costs a few % but having the cash in your pocket keep the business running smooth.  aside....  how can they charge 12k for 375lbs of material ~32/lb a 150hp huynday accent sells for 12k @ 2400lbs it works out to ~5/lb  marine prices are fishy ..."
697962,Billy Bob,2012-05-20 12:02:00,5865, Never heard of anyone leasing a outboard......WHO leases boating equipment....
697965,mike rousseau,2012-05-20 12:19:00,4661,"  i was actually looking into it....  theres quite a list of people who can lease including ""fisherpersons""  i think some lodges might do it...   but then ill forever be making payments....           im going to inquire about a rebuild with my mechanic... and if it makes any sense financially im gunna go that way for now... and then a new motor is gunna be in the near future... hopefully for next season...and then i should be able to get the rebuild cost back by selling my rebuilt honda..."
697969,John Bacon,2012-05-20 12:29:00,3277, Interest is a business expense regardless of whether you lease or buy.  Depending on which class the asset falls into you may actually get a better deduction if you purchase because the deduction is front end loaded... especially if purchase at the end of the year because you 50% of your depreciation in the year regardless of the exact date the you buy.
697973,krixxer,2012-05-20 12:44:00,274,"Not anyone, just a business.  If you need new equipment and your books are reasonable you can lease anything.  The way it works in my situation: I make the deal with whoever I want, send it the paperwork. They buy the equipment and I lease it back from them.  I can only guess but I don't see any differance between my air compressor and a motor; without them we would be out of business.   _i just spilled a full cup of coffee all over my desk writing this.grrrr_"

697999,Mike the Pike,2012-05-20 15:10:00,3421,Mike buy a Yamaha you will be so happy you did.  I had 50 Honda which was very reliable.Swapped it for my 60hp Yamaha and now I would only buy a Yamaha.  Lots of torque starts faster than my cars.Really Mike do yourself a favor buy a Yammy.  Also have the rpm control button can get it under 2 mph.  Reliable and much more quieter than my friends 60hp Mercury.  Yamaha sells the most outboards world wide must be a good reason for that.  MTP
698020,Billy Bob,2012-05-20 17:27:00,5865," FYI....Honda sells the most kinds of engines throughout the world....not saying the Yammy isn't the best or is the best......but Honda makes engines for lawn mowers all the way to locomotives....  My next outboard would ""probably be either a Yammy or a E-Tech...."
698050,SlowPoke,2012-05-20 20:31:00,2984," You could make an argument that replacing the motor is a maintenance expense, therefore 100% tax deductible against 2012 income. The ""asset"" is the  boat. I would suspect an engine replacement in my truck would not be a depreciating asset. Also keep in mind, if you purchase in NY you will be paying state tax + HST and duty landing in Canada. Don't forget to claim that."
697736,Dutch,2012-05-19 02:27:00,831,"I like tybo's idea.  As long as the rebuild is done by a certified mech. with quality parts, you should get a lot more use out of it.  There's a stigma out there that once a motor blows up, it is toast and if a rebuild is done, the same thing will happen again, a ticking time bomb so to speak.  I don't agree with that if done properly with good parts, a rebuild takes a motor back to essentially factory specs."
697738,mike rousseau,2012-05-19 02:30:00,4661,  from what i can tell its about $1500 max in parts...retail... and im guessing it would be the same cost as he estimated to completely tear apart the power head and put it back together...$300-500  so my 500 already in another 1500  in parts and another 500 in labour...   so $2500 total on the high end... maybe a bit less...   edit for crank cost... missed that...and bearing cost not included    ...
697740,ecmilley,2012-05-19 02:38:00,2163,"thats not to bad for a price i re did my own v6 outboard and by the time i got piston/rings/bearinss/gaskets i was still 1500. now onto your engine i am sorry but regardless of what i repair if i strip off a cylinder head i check it for truness and pressure test it sounnds like your guy may have missed a step i am sorry to say, but it happens to the best of us when you think you have a problem nailed down"
697743,fishnsled,2012-05-19 02:47:00,3520," Agree. Did mine last spring, bearings, crank, piston. sleeve, rings etc. Much happier with the $10G's plus in my pocket as to a dealer for an engine that would have been 12-15G's plus tax and labour, depending on the engine. This is for a 115hp. I shopped everywhere I could and the rebuild just seemed to make the most sense to me at the time. Wouldn't hesitate to do it again."
697744,mike rousseau,2012-05-19 02:47:00,4661,you may be right...   he said checked the head for trueness  im gunna continue to assume hes on the ball... everyone in the area says they are the best... and their lot has a lot boats... they are highly recomended and trusted by everyone in the area...  im trying to stay positive in thinking and im telling myself that my motor is the odd one out that was able to stump these guys...

697780,mike rousseau,2012-05-19 13:09:00,4661,  im not concerned with resale value... considering i put 500+ hours a year on my motor a new one would drop in value pretty fast... in 3 years it would be at 1500 hours!!!!!!!  my concern is how much i can get for my dollar...  ...
697783,lew,2012-05-19 13:20:00,12766,"Putting 500 hours a year on your motor is another excellent reason for going with the new one Mike.  And this is just a thought, but could you possibly use the new motor as some sort of tax deduction seeing as you use it for your guiding business"
697786,ecmilley,2012-05-19 13:31:00,2163,"ok at 500 hours a year your honda is at 6000 hours it doesn't owe you a cent rebuliding the power head is econmical choice and the rotating assembly is as good as new, the thing is the electrical-charging/starting/ignition is bound to fail at some point as is the lower unit and trim/tilt units you just may be ahead with a new motor at the very least it'll give you confidence and piece of mind"
697787,Dontcryformejanhrdina,2012-05-19 13:48:00,535,"I'd just buy the new one if it's in your budget. At least you'll have a warrenty if anything happens, plus it's not like your buying something you won't get good use out of."
697800,SlowPoke,2012-05-19 14:36:00,2984,A new motor will pay for itself in fuel efficiency and peace of mind. How many clients will you have to turn away waiting for a rebuild?

697873,Billy Bob,2012-05-19 23:26:00,5865,Have you looked at a Evinrude E-Tech.
697877,mike rousseau,2012-05-19 23:38:00,4661," No  I'm concerned with fuel economy considering my motor runs from when I leave the launch till I get back 5-12 hours later... I also don't like their ""no service for 3 years"" gimmic... It's based on hours... 300 i think...And I'd put the hours on in a few months...  They are a lot cheaper then 4 strokes..."
697681,mike rousseau,2012-05-18 22:59:00,4661,well...  i think my motor is toast...or at least toast enough to stop putting money into it...  so  what make has the lead nowadays...i know this is gunna be a mixed bag of answers and please dont get into debates or brand wars... just wanna know what you guys might know about features and performance...  im thinking about upping to a 50hp tiller...from my current 40hp... for the days with 3 big guys in the boat(mercman and mercmans brother...lol) and loads of gear and lunches...etc...  my main form of fishing is trolling... so a motor that idles low and smooth is key...  im leaning towards Yamaha but locally a Mercury is easiest...there is a dealer 5 minutes away on the states side...  no matter what im gunna buy in the states... prices are a few thousand dollars lower then in Ontario...  one question i have... the capacity plate states that a 45 is the max hp... is it illegal to go over this? or is that a recomendation from the manufacturer? im sure the boat can handle a 60hp motor no problem... and a 50hp would be perfect...  anyways... lets hear it everyone...  thanks in advance...  mike

697691,NANUK,2012-05-18 23:18:00,797,"X2 for Yamaha , not only reliable but the best tiller handle with RPM control. As for boat HP capacity rating, it's only a manf recommendation in Canada. Do not go over the rating if you plan on fishing USA side, it is enforced on that side and you could be pulled off the water . Another thing to consider is insurance, putting a bigger motor is not a good idea if there is ever an issue with a claim."
697697,DRIFTER_016,2012-05-19 00:07:00,10439,Yamaha has theire troll control system (ability to adjust idle speed for trolling) built right into the tiller handle as far as I know. Merc you need to purchase one of their smart craft guages in order to get their troll control system operational. Idle speed is also controlled through the guage. Cost will probably be close between the two with the added expense of the smart craft guage. The smart craft guage gives you tons of info though that you won't get with the stock Yammie guage.  I'm repowering my boat as soon as some other loans are paid off and will be going with new Mercs.
697700,ecmilley,2012-05-19 00:21:00,2163,"the yamaha has the 4 cyl with the pro-control tiller handle pretty much the sweetest tiller in the biz, smooth lots of torque sips fuel. the merc if i remember correctly is a $800 to get the nice tiller handle, besides the merc is made in china the yammy is made in japan"

697726,mike rousseau,2012-05-19 01:57:00,4661,"  but if i knew that 1000 or 1500 and shed be like new again thats not bad... but im spending hundreds for ""possible"" fixes"

697730,mike rousseau,2012-05-19 02:02:00,4661, so you talking new power head basically?  or whats involved?  what kinda cost/hours would i be looking at ballpark...?

697735,mike rousseau,2012-05-19 02:18:00,4661,  everything hes done or said makes sense... hes not spinning his wheels cause he doesnt know his stuff... as soon as he described some of what he found i figured head gasket before he even said that... but it wasnt... now hes thinking something warped from ice cause i ran it in the winter months... so he wants to tear apart the power head to try and find out whats warped and fix it...
