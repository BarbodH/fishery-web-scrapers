697941,Billy Bob,2012-05-20 09:07:00,5865,Thanks Merc.......very interesting article.......
698097,Muskieman,2012-05-20 23:17:00,2472,If those are Hybrids then Nipissing's Cache Bay is full of 'em .... I'm not sure about this one ...

698105,davey buoy,2012-05-20 23:31:00,5505," Caught it at the end,what a nice looking /angry/toothy fish. Very aggressive."
698121,dave524,2012-05-21 00:53:00,4508," Like to have it identified as such by a biologist, not uncommon for young pike to have barred markings changing to spots as they get older/bigger."
698126,Muskieman,2012-05-21 01:23:00,2472,"Bang on ! I've see that pattern often , Ray Carrignan is a good guy , but sometimes his producers make false claims , like his "" Blue Walleye"" show ...color phases are to blame sometimes I think ."
698129,Mike the Pike,2012-05-21 01:32:00,3421,"Hey Paul,how was the pike fishing today?"
698201,captpierre,2012-05-21 16:24:00,2521,"I'm no expert but when they are saying pickerel,  they are referring to chain pickerel, not walleye.  I think a chain pickerel is a type of pike.  I don't think a northern pike and walleye could mate and reproduce successfully.  Too different  Do we have chain pickerel in Ontario?  peter"
698202,Joeytier,2012-05-21 16:33:00,3990,Very cool...but I think I'd rather gouge my own eyes out than sit through an entire episode of Outdoor Passion

698264,Billy Bob,2012-05-21 20:33:00,5865, I don't know.......We have lots of areas/lakes that have both chain pickerel and N Pike and I have yet to see anything that looks  like this specie..........but I have only been fishing 54 years so far.
698283,mercman,2012-05-21 21:16:00,7054,"  Actually, you appear to be right.I did some googling, and For some reason, norther lake Champlain and parts of Lake Magog seem to have a greater concentration of this fish than most other places.There is no doubt that they are a rare occurance in other areas, but not as rare as WFN made out. Scientists cant figure out why these locations have a higher amount of the Hybrid than other bodies of water."

698594,Garfisher,2012-05-22 17:30:00,229,"We have two types of Pickerel actually, Chain Pickerel have recently moved into Ontario waters from New York state, although you can only get them around Kingston and the St.Lawrence River. Our truly native Pickerel is Esox americanus vermiculatus, the Grass Pickerel. These guys are found in scattered populations throughout Southern Ontario, and the biggest size they get to is only 12-13"" long. These fish can be mistaken for juvenile Pike when they are captured by anglers. They are a fish I want to target and catch. With respects to the hybrid, the way the head looks to me suggests it does have some Chain Pickerel in it (Ive caught one in Nova Scotia), although smaller Pike that are smaller than 20-24"" can show the progression from juvenile barring to adult spotting (which I have gotten into an argument before because someone caught a juvenile pike but people thought it was a Musky because ""Pike don't have barring, Muskies do"")."
