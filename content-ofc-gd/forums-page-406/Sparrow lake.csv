697368,Dan668,2012-05-17 21:44:00,1120,"Ya I figured, being part of the Trent and all. I've done well on kashe so hoping its similar. If you don't mind pm'ing me general areas, it be greatly appreciated. I normally always fish the kawarthas but I figured pike would be an easier catch then walleye so I don't bore my guests"
