508506,tb4me,2010-10-01 14:03:00,3295,Hey guys n gals. I have a small man cave I would like to heat this winter. I want to get a custom woodstove welded for it. I was in St williams ice fishing last year and they had the perfect stoves in the rental ice huts. Is there anyone on here interested in welding me one up? Thanks
508511,DanD,2010-10-01 14:40:00,2223,Here's a link to a couple of wood stoves that are on kijiji; 50 bucks for two of them? http://ontario.kijiji.ca/c-buy-and-sell-other-Ice-Hut-Woodstove-W0QQAdIdZ233146867  Dan.
508535,tb4me,2010-10-01 16:30:00,3295,Ya I seen them. I was looking for somthinga tad more custom. I want it on 18 inch legs so its not to close to the floor. Also Bellville is to far away for me to pick them up. Would be cheaper to pay somone to build me one. Thanks though Dan

508643,Tom McCutcheon,2010-10-02 03:12:00,627,I was just looking through the TSC flyer for October 1-7 and there is a small wood stove in there for $80.
508658,dave524,2010-10-02 10:08:00,4508,"Be careful , you might have insurance issues if anything happened and it was not suitably certified. A fairly recent post seemed to indicate that this might be the case.  Edit: the current TSC flyer that came a day or 2 ago had a couple of stoves that might meet your needs.  http://os.pageflip3d.com/see/TSC/24240TSC9E?cpg=website  edit: OOPs guess I should have read the whole thread , the TSC has already been mentioned, sorry."
509214,tb4me,2010-10-04 22:08:00,3295,That portable stove on the tsc site looks cheesy. I would like a steel box type stove. I guess ill just call a local fab shop n see what they will charge me.
