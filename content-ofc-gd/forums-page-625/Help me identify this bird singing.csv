508622,Joey,2010-10-02 01:50:00,9122,"I got woken up to the most beautiful bird singing the other day.  I put my camera down by the window and just let it play for awhile, which made me realize I need to stain and paint my bay window, but that's another matter  Anyhow, I have listened to countless North American bird calls on the internet for the past few days and cannot figure out what bird it is.  Can you give it a listen and let me know if you know what bird this is.  I have not heard it before or since.  It is a higher pitched whistle that goes higher and lower.  Here is the link and turn it up please:  Thanks alot for your help.  Joey"
508627,vinnimon,2010-10-02 01:59:00,2593,"Sounds like a robin bird,compared it too another,pretty similiar. But Im no expert!"
508631,kickingfrog,2010-10-02 02:04:00,8333,It's tybo whistling because he is now happily married.
508632,Leecher,2010-10-02 02:06:00,7832,Sorry Jo-Anne but can't figure it out.... it's a small bird that I'm sure
508634,kickingfrog,2010-10-02 02:07:00,8333,There are a few (2 at least) birds that I hear. The one is a chickadee. The other may be a chickadee as well.

508661,cynmar,2010-10-02 12:09:00,169,Yep there 's a chickadee in there but I would suggest it may be a goldfinch or housefinch. Both have kind of the same high pitched whistle at the bird feeder by the front door.  Bill
508666,Joey,2010-10-02 13:34:00,9122,Okay thanks for the replies.  I now think it is the golden crowned sparrow.  Appreciate the help.  Joey
508920,Cookslav,2010-10-03 21:25:00,1457, Agreed....totally a chickadee in there. Got a few around here as well.
508990,Muskieman,2010-10-04 02:20:00,2472,"I can hear a Chickadee or two, a Robin  a Grackle... but I think that the singing bird with the ♪♫ is a common Finch , I heard a similar one yesterday, my backyard was full of them , it reminded me of ♪♫Silent Night♫♪  also found this on You Tube    Randy "
509032,dave524,2010-10-04 07:23:00,4508," I've got a ton of White Throated Sparrows just recently arrived at my feeder on fall migration, they are very similar to the Golden Crowned Sparrows which are a western species. Most are the tan striped variation this season or maybe just immatures.  http://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/White-throated_Sparrow/id  They have stopped here for a week of so everyone of the almost 30 years I've been here, got to be one of the signs of the spring and fall for me , also get a wave of White Crowned Sparrows just a little later."
