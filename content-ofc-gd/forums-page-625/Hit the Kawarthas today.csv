509579,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-10-05 23:27:00,0,Great report. If Pete isn't getting any musky? There are no more musky in the lake!LOL Good to see OFC'ers getting out together!  Oh and Joey? The cloud does look like a goose!!!
509581,Guest LivingLegend,2010-10-05 23:38:00,0,Faaaaaannnnnntastic! FisherPete still has to tell me about his secret musky lures!
509008,Joey,2010-10-04 03:28:00,9122,"Paul and I had the pleasure of fishing with Fisherpete today on one of Kawartha lakes he frequents, so he was our guide for the day, but in our boat  He arrived at our place around 7:30 a.m. and we hit Timmies on the way of course.  There was a bit of a nip in the air, but we dressed for it and it wasn't too bad, a tad windy tho.  We pounded for musky all day, cleaning off some nice looking weeds along the way.  The boys were enjoying themselves and we had alot of laughs and good discussions.  I brought the camera of course, and shot some half decent pictures.             The fall colours were just starting, but not as much as I thought they would have already.     I thought this cloud looked like a Canada Goose!!!     Okay, on to the fish.  We didn't manage any musky     Our target species, but they guys got a couple fish to keep them occupied.          See, what a good deckhand Pete is, clearing Paul's weed clump          We fished till sundown, then drove home exhausted, sun and wind burned.  But it was worth it as we had a great day on the water      Thanks for the great day on the water Pete, you are welcome in our boat any time.  I appreciated your help with Paul at the launch and in the boat too!!  Cheers,  Joey"
509027,Skud,2010-10-04 04:44:00,739,Great report.  You have some real nice pictures too.  Did that pike become dinner? Gotta keep the Kawarthas clean of those buggers.
509028,Guest swiss,2010-10-04 04:59:00,0,nice camera.
509033,Roy,2010-10-04 09:18:00,13728,Another great report and pics Joey. Glad you guys had a good day on the water.
509036,splashhopper,2010-10-04 09:37:00,2931,awesome pics
509044,corvette1,2010-10-04 11:53:00,1765,nice day on the water joey congrats
509045,asdve23rveavwa,2010-10-04 11:57:00,2690,"Some great close-up shots, Joey!!!  Too bad you didn't hit any muskies, but, a great day on the water is what it is all about."
509056,MCTFisher9120,2010-10-04 12:31:00,3761,"Great report, really like the photo work! Also curious about the Pike, what lake were you fishing that had the pike in it?"
509058,jbailey,2010-10-04 12:34:00,866,pete doesn't look the same without a massive muskie in his arms!
509070,Joey,2010-10-04 13:54:00,9122," Well since Pete took us and enjoys his spots, I will leave the decision to him whether he wishes to divulge which lake it was.  But no, we did not keep the pike.  Never even thought about it to tell you the truth.  We were musky fishing and kept pretty focused on that and the other incidentals were a quick pic and back in.  Joey"
509078,Gregoire,2010-10-04 14:14:00,1397,Nice report. Too bad no ski's were boated but it sounds like a good day on the water. Definitely better than any day I've had in the last month or so (total days out 0).
509087,Kwan,2010-10-04 15:06:00,132,"Awesome pics.  The cloud definately shapes into your imagination, it is interesting.  Shows how nature really speaks to us, according to pre-scientific communities who lived in the forests.  That first bass hit a huge lure."
509089,EC1,2010-10-04 15:09:00,930,Nice to see you had fun out there Joey! Nice Pictures too!
509122,oldphart,2010-10-04 17:32:00,665,"~~~~Thanks for sharing Joey great pics,"
509138,ehg,2010-10-04 18:02:00,2666,"Great photos again! Like the seagull one. Nice, a day with the musky master"
509202,Jigger,2010-10-04 21:36:00,1237,"Maybe it was asked in another thread, but, what camera are you shooting with? Those are some great quality shots! Good to see you got into some fish at the very least!"
509206,daryl0815,2010-10-04 21:45:00,225,"Great post and pictures, definitely looks like a good day on the water, I am hoping that the pike and musky can co-habitate in the Kawarthas, because I dont think they can be stopped!"
509210,Terry,2010-10-04 21:53:00,14456,but Pete always gets muskie..what happened  Tybo is a jinx isn't he...LOL just kidding  oh and it looked like a goose to me too
509233,Joey,2010-10-04 22:57:00,9122," Jigger, it is a Canon EOS Rebel T2i, and thanks for the compliments.  I'm still learning how to use it.   Terry, I would have said he was a jinx, but Pete got skunked the time before too, so maybe he's lost it and it rubbed off on our outting"
509260,Fisherpete,2010-10-05 00:45:00,1814,"Joey & Paul... thanks again for a great day on the water. You guys are tons of fun to fish with, and man-o-man, that Lund is one sweet ride. MTBF and others who are wondering - as far as I know there are only Pike in one Kawartha lake so far, Balsam, and that is where we tried today. I got skunked for skis on Thursday too on another Kawartha lake, not even a sniff that day! At least I did raise one musky today, Paul saw it too, but only a low to mid 30's fish and not very aggressive at all. Joey and Paul are just as hardcore as I am - we spent the entire day casting, not trolling... and I'm sure that we each made the required 10,000 casts to deserve a musky!!! How's the arms today, J&P? I could almost pick up a pen today LOL...  Several factors probably played into us not getting any skis today... being Sunday, the lake had probably seen a lot of pressure already on Saturday, and all those boats pounding the lake on Sunday morning from the bass tourney didn't help either. I'm also not really sure what stage the lake is in yet regarding turnover, water temps were 54-55F, and the weeds have already died way back in many of my productive summer areas. Oh well, it was still a great day. I would gladly join you guys again, say the word!"
509273,Joey,2010-10-05 01:11:00,9122,"Yes, I have to say my body took a good beating yesterday, with surfing the waves and all that casting.  Usually we pound that hard when we're on vacation, but I had to work today  I think the most painful part is the blisters on my hands.  Well worth it tho and we will definately do it again soon, while the supposed ""feedbags"" are on  I've got your number now Pete so we'll get out in the next few weeks!!  We both really enjoyed your company  Joey"
509392,hirk,2010-10-05 14:25:00,571,"Saw you guys out there,could tell the water via the pics and the pike comment but kept my mouth shut lol.It was pretty slow all in all,my buddy won the Barrie open that day with just over 15lbs."
509396,Spiel,2010-10-05 14:34:00,9065,"You're getting pretty good with that camera Miss Joey Mrs. Tybo.  Too bad the muskies didn't show, I'm sure you'll get 'em next time."
509407,Shaun Rickard,2010-10-05 15:19:00,144,"Great report, and fantastic pictures!  Thanks for sharing.  Cheers, Shaun"
509414,Leecher,2010-10-05 15:41:00,7832,"Great report and pics Joey Sharing the water amongst friends is what it's all about I'm sure you'll get'em next time..... loved the pic of the cloud, definitely looks like a goose Thanks for sharing Jacques"
