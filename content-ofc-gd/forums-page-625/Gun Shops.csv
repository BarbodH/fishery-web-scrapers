509208,smally21,2010-10-04 21:47:00,993,"look up the gun you want online.  price it at lebarons, bps etc.  then look up the local shops to see if they match it.  its a bit of a drive but elwood epps on hwy 11 is a good shop, big selection.  check the big wholesalers in alberta they will ship to you.  the largest used site out there is canadiangunnutz.com and should give you an idea on used prices.  happy shopping!"
