509376,Dara,2010-10-05 13:48:00,3052,"Well, it was so nice Saturday I decided I needed a bit of time on the water. I decided that about 12;30 in the afternoon. By 1;30 I had bait and the boat launched. I love having a garage to park the boat in so that its all ready to go.  Well. I fished all over looking for jumbos or eyes. Sad day again. OK, one more spot before I call it quits.  One line down trolling and I decide I'm going to put a second down. Right away the rod on the holder starts to bouncing. Toss the tangled line down and grab the rod. I nail a 3 lb smallmouth. Not what I was gunning for but at least its a fish.  Toss it back, forgot my camera darnitt, and get set up again. One line down and managed to egt the second down this time. Bang, second rod a bouncing. This is a pita, trying to keep on trolling and reel a fish in. I lands a 18"" eye. Into the live well you go baby. OK, skip the second line. back to the beginning of the troll patern and put the line down. Not 5 minutes and something wants to rip it out of my hand. Then leaves. Fix the bait and back down again...5 minutes and bang. After a good battle I land a 22 incher. Another couple of misses, one to the boat and drops off and its time to head in for dinner. A nice day on the water.           Then Monday getting toward the end of the work day I decides its a good night to try again. Call up my buddy and see if he feels like going along. OK, 5;15 at my house.  Hitched up and fishing by 6.  6;30 first fish is in the boat.    another 22 incher  sadly that was the only one but I have them tuned in now. Expecting a good season.  It was a nice evening on the water.  "

509495,Dara,2010-10-05 19:34:00,3052,"  I have a pretty good grip on him, his gill got smushed up. Almost jumped overboard on me.  Can't wait to get out there again. I figure about 3 times a week for the next month should cover it.  And yes..St Marys area"

509575,Dara,2010-10-05 23:01:00,3052,"  Doesn't it have to be over 26"" to earn the name of ""Walter""?  I think that was the rule at Red Pine"
