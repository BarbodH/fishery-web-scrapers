509246,hoosier,2010-10-05 00:18:00,29,My 7 year old and I hit a local river in Indiana for some fishing the other weekend. Not exactly the fast action you guys get up north but it keeps us entertained.   The boy ready to go.   Here is our ride.   White bass   Smallmouth      Not the best pics of this next fish but I think it is a spotted bass instead of a smallie.    Pumpkinseed   Scenery    The highlight of the day was seeing a bald eagle which is a rare sight in our area.  Unfortunately it took off before we could get a picture.

509468,kickingfrog,2010-10-05 18:18:00,8333,"   No worries here.  I though it was interesting that someone with from indiana with the handle hoosiers would be such a big reds fan. Maybe there were fishing in Ohio, and wanted to fit in?"
509475,TC1OZ,2010-10-05 18:36:00,987,Amazing report! That day will stick with both of you forever!  This is the main reason I had a son! So I had someone to take fishing hahahaha.
509488,hoosier,2010-10-05 19:08:00,29,  Yeah we're in Indiana but close to Cincinnati so we pull for the Reds.
509605,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-10-06 00:39:00,0,Great report. Nice stretch of water. Your son looks like he really enjoys fishing!
