509000,Skud,2010-10-04 03:07:00,739,Since I left my Bushnell Game camera up at Eddie North's camp a few weeks ago I had to take advantage of the sale at CT last week. I bought myself the Moultrie Spy cam and set it up on a major junction of deer trails. I am really hooked on these cameras and always look forward to seeing what I caught on film. Even though I managed a lot of great pics last year I didn't get a deer.  I have yet to even buy my tag for this year.  Here is a pic of the first doe to stroll buy the camera. I have some apples out now so I should see even more this week.

509007,Skud,2010-10-04 03:27:00,739,It is a 4 mp. I also cleaned the pic up a bit.

509030,Stern Rules,2010-10-04 06:57:00,342,I thought that looked really good for a trail cam pic. How much did you clean it up? How did it look before?
509054,LucG,2010-10-04 12:28:00,779," Moultrie Cams shoot pretty good images. I have the same model, and if the conditions are right, ei sun, fog, dim light,... it takes amazing pics."
