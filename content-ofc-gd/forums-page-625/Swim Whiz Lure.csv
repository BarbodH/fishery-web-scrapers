He inherited a tackle box from his father in law last summer, and this lure was in it. My friend used this lure at our fall fishing trip last year and hammered walleye and smallies with it. I've looked online for it and couldn't find one anywhere, all i can find is 6 inches and up.  I also looked to see if believer tackle made one this small, but they don't. Anyone? Oh ya, its plastic, not wood. K.S."

You could try hunting around on craigslist or eBay, but I don't think LeBlanc made many of the 3.5 inch ones .... I don't believe they sold particularly well."
509181,stubbex1,2010-10-04 20:24:00,164,"thanks guys...too bad they don't make them anymore.  I did see couple on Ebay, so maybe there are more around!"
