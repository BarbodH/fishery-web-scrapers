509006,bigugli,2010-10-04 03:26:00,6138,Sometimes it gets downright frustrating reading the  reports on the board about the great fishing. My turn. The chaperon/son and I drove up to Orillia to meet up with CPH today. Left Niagara's stormy skies behind to be greeted by bluebird skies and calm. Any who know Steve will tell you he is a stand up guy and knows where to find a few fish. Well we found fish. Early in the day we caught this sow.  Followed by a surprise.  In the end Rob and I brought home 60 very sizeable perch.   THank you for a great day out Steve.
509016,Joey,2010-10-04 03:39:00,9122,"Awesome, and nice sucker too LOL!  Joey"
509035,splashhopper,2010-10-04 09:35:00,2931,Looks like it was a bountiful day for you
509037,Spiel,2010-10-04 10:15:00,9065,Suddenly I have a craving for a perch and egg breakfast.
509041,bigugli,2010-10-04 11:26:00,6138,I can tell you it tasted fandangtastic
509042,corvette1,2010-10-04 11:50:00,1765,way to go bruce congrats
509046,crappieperchhunter,2010-10-04 12:04:00,2582,"The pleasure was all mine Bruce, Fishing perch with friends on a beautiful fall day is about as good as it gets for me.  And thank you for the Salsa and pickles. I came home to the house smelling of homemade beef stew...which I gorged myself on  ....so I haven't sampled any of your stuff yet. But if it is anything close to previous treasures you have given me...I don't imagine any of it will last until next weekend."
509048,Spiel,2010-10-04 12:08:00,9065,  That's not helping me any Bruce..... LOL  
509050,asdve23rveavwa,2010-10-04 12:19:00,2690,"Holy cow...make that sow!!!!  That is one ""beauty"" perch!!"
509053,MCTFisher9120,2010-10-04 12:25:00,3761,"Nice, that big perch reminds me of the 14"" I nailed during the ice season. Impressive catch for early fall, congrads!  MTBF"
509077,Rod Caster,2010-10-04 14:12:00,5784,There's nothing like a good feed of perch. Best fish and chips are made with perch...imo  That first fish is a manatee of a perch...nice catch.
509107,Beans,2010-10-04 16:37:00,3339," Did you have to abide by Steve's boat rules and throw it back?...""Only perch in the 9 to 12 inch range can be kept""...That size are good spawners...  The biggest Steve and I did was a couple of 13+ inchers last week but we only kept 8 perch in the slot size for my wife and must have thrown back close to a hundred or more of all sizes...A fun day !"
509152,Leecher,2010-10-04 19:00:00,7832,WOW Bruce that is one hell of a big perch   Congrats Glad you got out to enjoy some time on the water Thanks for sharing Jacques
509182,crappieperchhunter,2010-10-04 20:25:00,2582, Beansie you know when I catch those ones they go back. But I never impose my standards on anyone else....especially if they give me salsa and pickles when they go out with me  Now if we fished together every weekend and lots of these fish where being kept...that's a whole other story....more salsa would be required to keep me silent
509185,TC1OZ,2010-10-04 20:33:00,987,Looks like some good fishing! It's all the pollution down here that ruins the good reports!
509186,bassjnkie,2010-10-04 20:35:00,1101,"Looks like fun, nice catches. The sucker is a good size. Well done."
509204,Beans,2010-10-04 21:43:00,3339, So you're telling me you're an easy bribe...   
509231,crappieperchhunter,2010-10-04 22:52:00,2582,  My lawyer has advised that I am not to answer that question
509239,bigugli,2010-10-04 23:52:00,6138,bribery works
509282,vinnimon,2010-10-05 01:43:00,2593,Thats awesome Bruce Nice Perch!
509292,icefisherman,2010-10-05 02:22:00,952,"Well no question Steve knows his Simcoe perch... I was going to go out Sunday as well but changed my mind because of the high winds forecasted....oh well I should have known better not to listen to the weather guy... Good catch guy, I am sure they were delicious  Cheers, Ice Fisherman"
509571,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-10-05 22:49:00,0,Very nice perch. But there has to be a faster way to clean perch!
