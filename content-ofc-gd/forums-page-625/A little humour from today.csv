508985,vinnimon,2010-10-04 01:50:00,2593,"Well I fished bronte today, 1 line bump and no one caught a thing at the peir.At about noon the sailors were heading out to venture the high waves.Their nuts I may add!Well one sailboat passed us and the motor guy was saying his prayers with a smile on his face, his partner wasnt worried at all. 5 minutes later they turned around!The motor guy looked over, smiled and brushed his forehead with his hand and thanking god at the same time. The funniest part was he had a problem with sitting in one spot ! You do the math!I almost ended up with number 1 in my pants, from laughing so much!!!! Lk O was rough today, south peir had a good wash out! Another funny and my good deed for the day!A sail boat owner went aboard his boat!after watching  him,he tightened down his rear tie downs! After watching him for a few minutes trying to step on to the shore! I told him to add a foot in the rear as I tightened the front lines for him!He lmost ended up in the drink!Wouldnt ask for help at all,and his wife took off before all of this started! With my fiasco yesterday, and todays little oops!So far it was awesome weekend of fishing!PRICELESS!"
