508802,ehg,2010-10-03 04:12:00,2666,"Went out for my fifth day fishing this season, so anyday out is awesome whether fish are caught or not.  Planned to catch fish however so a trolling for muskies we went. The fishing wasn't on fire thats for sure but a great day was had with primo 'gweeches, snacks, liquids and top shelf Cuban cigars.  This sign reminded us of the possibility of further development in the future,  They have been talking of this for over 30yrs, nothing is happening though. There was very little activity on the lake in the cold today.  Dave had a musky hit is jointed perch Leo Lure, not a bad fish. As he was leading it towards the cradle, the fish jumped clear out of water and threw the 12 inch lure back at us. Probably went 40"" or so, quite exciting still. Buddy had a couple more fish on briefly, the last one took all his line and lure. We were trolling across deepest part of lake basin and Dave ended up getting to his mono backing on reel when fish hit. A few moments later line snapped. That was the end of muskies for the day.   Definitely was chilly and became colder as the afternoon quickly was becoming evening. Started to try jigging for walleyes on deep rocky bumps. Got this rock bass in 30 ft of water, going deep for the fall. First fish in the boat.   The day sure is going by fast. Luckily Dave caught this walleye in same spot, before the day was done.    The fish measured at 29.5 inches and had a real big skull. Put it back in quickly to continue future generations.  Had a great day fishing again even though i caught nothing myself!"

508815,crappieperchhunter,2010-10-03 10:39:00,2582,Sounds and looks like a good day to me.  It stopped being about how many fish I put in the boat years ago for me.  Thx for sharing your day.
508818,spincast,2010-10-03 10:57:00,3279,nice 'eye.
508832,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-10-03 12:40:00,0,"Great report. Sounds like Dave has to come a little more prepared for those Musky! He needs to get heavier line! But fashion wise, he looks like he came more then prepared.lol  WOW!!! That is a monster eye for the Kawarthas.  Sucks that you didn't catch any fish ehg but at least you got out and enjoyed mother nature.Better luck next time!"
508843,TC1OZ,2010-10-03 13:02:00,987, This picture defines your post! It's what life is made of! Congrats on the awesome day out with a friend!
508845,ehg,2010-10-03 13:04:00,2666,"Yes, Dave needs to pay attention to how much line he lets out when trolling. Turms out he was inches from mono backing when fish hit. Fish was good size, the mono was no match.  That was one of the biggest eyes i have seen up that way in 25 yrs of hitting Pigeon. Picture doesn't do it justice.  Despite not getting a bite, i had a great day just being there."
508899,Rod Caster,2010-10-03 18:59:00,5784,Very nice walleye!
508900,Kwan,2010-10-03 19:06:00,132,"what a walleye!  I've yet to hook a walleye for a long, long time..	great report!"
508996,Nanook,2010-10-04 02:54:00,565,"A bad day's fishing sure beats a good day at work. Nice 'Rye for this lake. Judging by the 'Pic,you could have crossed over to the main shoreline, climed up the rocks and hd a nice hot toddy at our place"
509049,corvette1,2010-10-04 12:09:00,1765,nice eye congrats
509055,MCTFisher9120,2010-10-04 12:28:00,3761,"You win some, you loose some. That Walleye is a great catch, glad the trip was fun!  Thanks for sharing, MTBF"
509129,ehg,2010-10-04 17:46:00,2666,"This was a totally win, win day despite the cold front bringing the chill. Had a 40 inch+ musky clear water beside the boat and a 10 lb Kawartha walleye in the boat. Unforgettable"
509137,ehg,2010-10-04 17:59:00,2666," For comparison, This was a 30"" walleye i pulled from Pigeon 15 yrs ago. Weighed 9.75 lbs. It died during the fight, so kept it and my father ate it. Dudes fish had a way bigger head and wider body and obviously was bigger.  Good times, good times"
509163,Leecher,2010-10-04 19:22:00,7832,Great report and pics Erik Man that's a beauty of a walleye    Congrats to Dave Sorry to hear of your skunk but you'll get'em next time Thanks for sharing mon ami!!! Jacques
