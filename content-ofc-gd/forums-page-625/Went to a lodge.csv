So we get there, get the car unpacked to find we had a decent size room and good beds for everyone.  It wasn’t musty and had a decent view and I swear I could see a water slide from my room...  Either way, we got everything unpacked and all set up for a fun day (Saturday) and wouldn’t you know it, they all want to go and hit the water!  So we get ready and head down the steps to the water.  On our way I swear I had seen a wolf and a moose!!!!  My kids said they had seen it too but I have to take it with a grain of salt from them as they are only 7 and 3.  So we get down to the water, get all set up and the place is packed and not a single fish in sight.  I checked the shallows, the deeper pools and NOTHING!  I even had people say to me “excuse me, this is MY SPOT” just while I was passing by!  Needless to say the wife and kids didn’t catch a thing but they all did have a fun time.  I did have a look at the pic’s my wife took on the camera (yet to download them to the pc) and in fact there was a moose!  She has a pic of a moose, a wolf some scenery and the lodge.  When I find the time I will post some for you.      All I can say is that Great Wolf Lodge is a good place to go for the kids to have fun (adults too) but the fishing sucks."

I was gonna try a spinnerbait from the foot of the waterslide for the Curvy Redheaded Bass.. but the lifeguard seemed to have a problem with that.  Memories for the kids!! sometimes torture for the parents but well worth it in the long run..  Randy
