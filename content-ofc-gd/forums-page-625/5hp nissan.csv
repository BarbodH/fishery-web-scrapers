I've been trying to figure out if the older 5hp nissan motors have the gas tank built into the motor themselves? When I check websites all I can find is new motors, and it seems 4hp max have the gas can, but what I want is to find if the older circa 1995 come with the gas tank. Anyone ever have one? do they exist? know of any for sale? I'd like to throw one on the back of my porta-bote for them back lakes. Thanks Greg Sheppard."
