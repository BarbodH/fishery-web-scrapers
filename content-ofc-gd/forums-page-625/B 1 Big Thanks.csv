Also like to thank their team,the guys at the ramps,guys on the water, people helping with weigh-in(great system to keep the fish healthy), the kids helping to release the fish,the guys on stage and everybody else SUPER GREAT JOB..We also met alot of old friends and a bunch of new ones( even a few from Ontario) Also like to thank my partner Gaetan,we set 3 goals. First...make day 2 Second...5 fish each day Third...Top 50 We suceeded in all three, so for us it was a complete success for two old muskie guys  YIPPEEEE...

For me, the best part was being able to keep in the loop and know what's going on during weigh-in by getting set-up on Twitter (R621fisher), was like being there, getting texts every couple mins with the next teams weight - just awesome and I think the B1 Team really set the bar for other tournaments and leagues to follow!   Cheers G."
