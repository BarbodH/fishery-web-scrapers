Ebay looks great with all the cheap stuff, but I cant wait for shipping as i have a few days off work and want to spend two days tying flies, hahaha."

509546,solopaddler,2010-10-05 21:51:00,8605,If you go to Wilson's ask to speak to Billy. He's a great guy and a wealth of information.
509562,Spiel,2010-10-05 22:21:00,9065,  You're welcome.  
509577,MJL,2010-10-05 23:14:00,2427," He's also a great rod builder too as well as an amazing fly caster.  Dozer, if you're in the Scarlem area, you can check out Angling Specialties (Kennedy and Passmore area).  There's a decent amount of fly tying stuff to be had.  Unfortunately the shop may be permanently closing November/December."
