508785,basketclam,2010-10-03 02:12:00,115,That's a real beauty of a pup.  Tell us about him (her).  How old?  Did you do the training yourself?  Were you pleased with the breeder you bought the dog from?  Why'd you choose a GSP?
508864,Rustic-Fisher,2010-10-03 14:37:00,826,"Pup is seven months old and was brought up from the States. I could not have asked for a better breeder after being burned last year by one    doing all the training myself with the help of some buddys that hunt GSPs and a healthy population of wild birds 2 min from home. As for picking that breed, I needed a dog that was high strong and full of energy and willing to go all day, ease of training, and an all round versatile dog that preformed well in a variety conditions. The GSP being the meat and potatoes of the pointy breeds I choose it."
