The average size was what you see.. I was out with a OFC Newbie ""AverageJoeFishing""... welcome him aboard...he'll be useful here..    Randy "
508964,vinnimon,2010-10-04 00:08:00,2593,"My dad used to catch the odd blue one, way back when on the grand!"
508968,cram,2010-10-04 00:26:00,1733,I read something about it being in the slime.....and a theory that it was a type of sunscreen/UV protection.  Catch them quite frequently on our lake.  Just a guess (haven't actually measured) but seem like almost 1/2 are like that....at least a 1/4.
508970,Rod Caster,2010-10-04 00:31:00,5784,The blue ones still have the white dot on the tail. Funny how the lateral line is nearly invisible on bluey. Do you know if there is any difference in the meat?
508972,kickingfrog,2010-10-04 00:33:00,8333,"Grey squirrels and black squirrels are the same as well, it is just a colour phase as stated."
508973,Muskieman,2010-10-04 00:40:00,2472, Had them for supper tonight and they look and cook and tasted the same in the pan.  I was wondering the same thing myself no difference.  Randy 
508974,bow slayer,2010-10-04 00:44:00,1074,Randy  on Restoule up in your area we get about a 50/50   with yellows and blues.

508991,Nipfisher,2010-10-04 02:29:00,2449,Good job Randy. I love Wickstead. We fished the opening weekend there for about 4 years in a row. Lots of nice eating walleye and we managed a few blue ones too. How far down the lake did you go?  Welcome aboard AverageJoeFishing. Are you a North Bay guy or Sturgeon Falls guy?
508997,Muskieman,2010-10-04 02:58:00,2472,"AverageJoeFishing, brought me out roughly 2 miles north of the dam..to 4 or 5 different spots. We caught fish all day and went through almost 6 dozen minnows and a few breakoffs (surgically precise) from pike (boated 2 or 3)and also caught a whack of smallies.. I tells ya what, he knows Wickstead 150 x more than I do. He's a Sturgeon Fallsonien  that can't wait to post here, I guess that he's still being screened.. signed up lastnight.  Randy "
