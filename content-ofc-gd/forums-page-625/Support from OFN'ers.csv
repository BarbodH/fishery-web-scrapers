My wife is a Breast Cancer survivor of 13 years, and is involved with the Knot A Breast team here in Hamilton. The teams are a fantastic support system for Breast Cancer patients, and their families. I urge any fellow OFC members down your way to attend the dance, and support the Survivor Thrivers."
