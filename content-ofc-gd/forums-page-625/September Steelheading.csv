508823,justin elia,2010-10-03 11:58:00,151,"September has been a great month for steelheading.  We've been hit with alot of rain pushing a good number of steelies into various river systems.  Over the last 3 weeks, I've been fishing Gbay tribs, North Shore Lake O tribs and I made it to the Catt for a quick morning fish.  I hope all of you guys are taking advantage of this opportunity as its only going to get better.  Here are some pics over the last 3 weeks.  Some Gbay Salmon     Ontario Steel                     I would encourage all of you steelheaders out there to pinch down your barbs to help protect smolts.  Im sure alot of you have been catching them year round in most tribs due to the cool and wet summers we had in 2008 and 2009.  Have a great season."

508831,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-10-03 12:33:00,0,Great report! When I used to river fish I used to like the smaller ones as opposed to the 10+ lbers and up. Thanks for sharing.
508834,timmeh,2010-10-03 12:42:00,609,"Good stuff Justin. There definitely are some fish around. And good advice for protecting the smolts, they are everywhere which is great for the future."

509060,justin elia,2010-10-04 13:10:00,151," Smolts are aggressive little buggers and they'll eat anything, even loonie size roe bags.  Releasing them unharmed means they'll probably come back in a few years."
509064,torco,2010-10-04 13:28:00,656,"Great report and advice on the barbs. I am going to start fishing steel this weekend coming, I usually start around the thanksgiving weekend."
