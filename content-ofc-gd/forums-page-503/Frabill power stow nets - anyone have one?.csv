610757,scugpg,2011-08-09 19:21:00,1373,Can anyone comment on the new Frabill power stow nets? http://www.frabill.com/catalogsearch/result/?q=Powerstow%20net  It looks like they have joined forces with Stowmaster on this one http://stowmaster.norsemenoutdoors.com/shop/category/stowmaster/tournament . Just wondering what the netting is like etc.
610760,cram,2011-08-09 19:40:00,1733,"I have a musky sized one.  Mesh is finer than I like and the bag is too deep, but overall I really like it.  Pretty sure the mesh is exactly the same as the new stowmasters (their old mesh is different)."
610770,cram,2011-08-09 20:08:00,1733,"Depending on what size you want, i believe Bass Pro has their own branded version of a stowmaster as well.  Smaller sizes (bass, etc)"
610781,landry,2011-08-09 21:05:00,1005,cram gave a good review - I own the stowmaster.
610879,scugpg,2011-08-10 01:45:00,1373,"Thanks guys. I verified that this net is made under license from Stowmaster. I was thinking something along the lines of the 94IM in the stowmaster, sounds like these nets are really deep! 42 and 50 for the 94IM comparable version."
