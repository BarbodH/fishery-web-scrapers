Just wondering if anyone could share some info on the park,the lake (baits,species)and maybe recommend some area attractions that would be wonderful.We are planning a day to explore in Quebec crossing in Pembroke. I am camping on a site right on the river just wondering if my son who wants to fish 24/7 would have any luck angling right on the site in the river? thanks in advance for any info."
