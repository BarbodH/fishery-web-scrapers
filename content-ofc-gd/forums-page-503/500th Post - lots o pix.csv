610746,Pikeslayer,2011-08-09 18:29:00,1443,"Well, I've been holding off posting any topics/replies for a while now as I am currently sitting @ 499 posts. The next one makes me a 'guide' and I am looking forward to receive all the free sponsor stuff and cash that goes with the title (feel free to pm me for my mailing address). I wanted to post something 'memorable/special (other than 'nice fish') and have been mulling over some ideas. I couldn't decide on any one in particular, so I will try to squeeze a few into this post.  Most importantly, I have met many new friends on this forum and I look forward to growing 'wiser' together. I am also looking forward to meeting more new members in the weeks to come as we are still working on our 'trip trades' and 'charity charters'.  And I can't forget about the odd good deal I've picked up through the classifieds as well as learning some new and useful tips through general discussion  On a personal note; I have read and followed our members that have endured life changing challenges. I rejoice in their triumphs and grieve in their losses. God bless us all  Okay, now on to fishing. I wanted to put together a fancy dancy you tubey thingy with music and all that jazz. I made an attempt. It didn't go well, so I thought I would just post some of my favourite fishing photos, in no particular order;  [/url] click on this link"
610748,Terry,2011-08-09 18:33:00,14456,"500 cool   once you have 1000 post they give you a link to the rest of the boards website                           and 10,000 well you will have to wait to see what that gives you     "

(I haven't had a tonne of time and still haven't navigated through that Photobucket thingy you pointed me towards.   )  I know, I've still got a picture of a nice salmon in one hand and a bunch of bananas in the other! Who knew you weren't supposed to bring bananas fishing.  Great pics. I'll TRY to get a few of ours up as well. Oh yah, and thanks for doing the charity portion of things for Fishing for Tyler. As you know Sue, Brent & I had a great time!"
