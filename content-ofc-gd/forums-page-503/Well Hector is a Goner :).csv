610394,Leecher,2011-08-08 23:33:00,7832,Enough said   Bye bye dude   Enjoy your new environment   Released far away to eat another day  
610398,ChrisK,2011-08-08 23:35:00,2772,It's a groundhog ??? You don't like the little fella I take it
610399,irishfield,2011-08-08 23:36:00,26272,Careful what you post Jacque... you could do 10 years in jail.. 8 more than if you beat your kids!
610403,Leecher,2011-08-08 23:41:00,7832, No cause he was eating my apples and making a mess out of the back yard    Hiding under the shed.... he wasn't harm in any way but released far away from home   I hear you Wayne... checked with the city before doing anything and basically told us to phone SPCA and a $30.00 dollar fee for pickup and release near by.... they also said that we could do it ourselves.... so bye bye Hector
610409,irishfield,2011-08-08 23:48:00,26272,They have no issues travelling long distance. There is usually a burrow.. or under the shed will do. Mom.. Pop and generally a litter of 5 of so..
610411,Leecher,2011-08-08 23:51:00,7832,  Yeah I know    Had 2 of them a couple of years ago and couldn't do anything about it.... tried to trap them but no success     This time fell for a couple of apples that my daughter place inside the cage... was kind of surprise to see that he went for it
610414,irishfield,2011-08-08 23:56:00,26272,They like fresh lettuce....   .. hate Lead.
610415,Terry,2011-08-09 00:00:00,14456,They always fall for lead with me.....
610418,mercman,2011-08-09 00:04:00,7054,"I had the same problem till recently Jacques.Heard a ruckus in the yard on the weekend Trinity  Was having a bit of fun I wont get into detail, but lets just say. Trinity 1, fur bearin varment 0"
610419,Leecher,2011-08-09 00:07:00,7832,  He also loved to eat the heads of carrot and beans    Lead was always on my mind but not an option where I live
610421,irishfield,2011-08-09 00:08:00,26272,You not have a pillow you could sacrifice... LOL They always work in the movies....
610422,Leecher,2011-08-09 00:09:00,7832, Good on Trinity
610423,Leecher,2011-08-09 00:11:00,7832, Movies you say LOL  Only thing that comes to mind is Caddy Shack
610446,pikehunter,2011-08-09 01:24:00,1659,Did ya try shining a bright light over the shed? Works for Wiarton Willy. One look at his shadow and he runs back into his hole to hide!
610450,Leecher,2011-08-09 01:30:00,7832, Good one pikehunter    May be I should of tried it
610482,rob v,2011-08-09 02:45:00,535,aren't they defined as varmints/pests when they do that sort of thing ?   22 usually takes care of the problem.
610483,irishfield,2011-08-09 02:50:00,26272,Ask the guy in Toronto that may do 2 to 10 for beating a raccoon with a shovel for eating his garden Rob. As for part #2 of your post.. YES!
610484,backbay,2011-08-09 02:51:00,773,http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBpw1sdFu2w 
610550,Freshtrax,2011-08-09 05:34:00,2215,Garden hose down the hole works just fine in the city!
610730,rob v,2011-08-09 17:32:00,535,If that guy had been beating a rat with his shovel - nobody would have cared - what's the difference ?     His neighbours just lived too close.  what he should have done is what Leechman did - except he should have tied a brick to that cage - and taken that coon for a swim.
610830,Leecher,2011-08-10 00:02:00,7832,    Wish I could of found it.... The shed is sitting on a big rock and no way for digging    he was just going from yard to yard hiding under everyone's sheds    He now has a very large variety of vegetables to choose from at his new location   I know exactly how you feel Rob but not an option where I live
