610048,Leecher,2011-08-07 23:53:00,7832,"Hey all,  Been a while since my last report.... fishing wise this year been very slow for me    Only been able to target speckle trout and for the most part, been on the small size (not picture worthy)... but this weekend, was invited to the in-law's cottage (my wife's side) and what a blast we had  It's been almost 20 years since we set foot in that part of the country and let me tell you, we all had a super time.  The plan was for my wife's brother to meet us at home this past Friday after work, then follow him to destination   The drive was only an hour a half from my place and while driving.... plans of fishing was already being processed in my head  I was pumped to the max since I knew there was small mouth bass and lakers in the lake.... when we got there, it was kind of late..... but I had a plan   Meet & greet the in-laws   then setup the rod with an old school Jitterbug and let her rip on surface  This is what was waiting for us when we arrived    Then my daughter joined me on the dock for some action...    My wife and her brother were quite pleased to be sharing the fire pit along the shoreline    My first smallie on the third cast   My daughter took the pic with her Blacberry    Jitterbug shot... Release    At this point I was very pleased with the results since my goal was reached but I wasn't done yet    I wanted more  I decided to hit the beach area and cast into the shallows in front of the cottage.... this is the results    Another smallie on the Jitterbug  Releasing the beauty    Man what a rush to fish in the dark and hear the sound of a feisty bass break surface and chomp on your lure  The next morning, I woke up, bright and early (5:30am) and went to the dock to see if I could get another beauty to commit to the old school Jitterbug but it wasn't meant to be  Here's the view of the office while I waited for the captain of the vessel anchored at dock side    Some more shots of this lovely place  Water front    Daughter and wife        Random shots            That morning we went in search for some smallies and got a few      Inside views          Supper time    Cottage owner and MÃ©lissa    My wife and I    The owner and me    I ain't into swimming much but manage to dip them old feet of mine since it was so hot    Wife got a shot of that    Sunday morning was not looking to good but we got out and found some decent ones      All in all was a great time setting foot on familiar grounds Hope you enjoy Leechman"
