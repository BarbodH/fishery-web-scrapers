I can guarantee... if someone comes out alive and with all their limbs it will be you!  I'm leaving tomorrow for Collingwood for an Elvis festival... (work related).....( I'm not a big fan).....  I just hope that I don't get injured  by someone stepping on my Blue Suede Shoes....  but really...  I have 12 days off as of the 29th of July and will be spending it at the Trailer...  I'm bringing a double stuffed first aid kit and a few gallons of Benedryl & Bactine... I don't know about you.. but when I go on an expedition .. I look before I leap, and think before I act, and still ... I expect to get injured ( I'm surprized that Curlrap hasn't added to this post) It's a bonus for me when I come home without some sort of injury.. I've been like this all of my 38 years, with scars to prove it.  a few highlights...  #1 Bear attack #2 Mole jumped out of livewell and bit me on the nose (I was best man at a wedding that day) left a good gash. #3 Knocked myself out with a hatchet fell too close to the fire and melted my glasses and burned my hair. #4 Installed portable outhouse over beesnest.... multiple sings on Peter& #5 Got hit in the neck with a golfball while fishing... I still have no clue where it came from.. whoever it was, he has a hell of a drive. #6 Got my goatee caught in a bilge pump...  (don't ask) #7 while getting attacked by Red Ants.. I ran up onto the deck into a closed patio door breaking my glasses and getting a fat lip & bloody nose .. twirled into the air off the deck  onto a new BBQ and my daughter's bike  (multiple injuries)  ..  Again .. I can guarantee you'd be safe going fishing with me...rest assured I'll have a double stuffed First Aid Kit for you to use.   Randy "
605280,Grimace,2011-07-22 01:32:00,2020,I would fish with ya any day of the week.  #7 is awesome.  Just awesome.
605286,GBW,2011-07-22 01:50:00,8460,what's that old saying Randy?  if you din't have bad luck you would have no luck at all so there you have it.  Don't forget to wear a helmet at all times!
