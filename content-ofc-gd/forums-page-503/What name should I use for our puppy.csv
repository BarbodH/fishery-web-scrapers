611084,Billy Bob,2011-08-10 19:12:00,5865, Many many fishing season ago when I was a young tad pole I had a Cockapoo named Chico. GREAT DOG.
611189,grimsbylander,2011-08-11 02:13:00,3016,  I've only ever knew one lab named Chino. Thought it was a great handle for a chacolate.

So here's what she looks like....BTW she's from a litter of 9 chocolate labs and the family kids named her Fireball because she's the most energetic of the bunch.  "
609714,Grimace,2011-08-06 12:39:00,2020,Name her 'seven'.

609772,Blue Lk,2011-08-06 16:16:00,337, Good thing you don't drive a Ford pick-up. F150 would be a terrible handle for a dog.

609796,Carp,2011-08-06 18:36:00,1488,They both sound OK. I kinda liked Remington a little better than Tundra though.
610023,motion,2011-08-07 22:49:00,403,"Hey Billy Bob, congrats on the new pup you will be getting. She's definitly a cutie! As you will see from my avitar, I have an 11 month old choclate lab pup myself. We named him Toby. My kids have re-named him ""Trouble"". He's an energetic little guy who's now my best fishing buddy (my son will have something to say about that) They are great dogs if trained properly. I""m still working on that!  Oh, I like the suggestion of Cocoa as well. Tundra and Remington are a little more masculine but if those are your two choices, go with Remmy.  Cheers.   "

610578,blaque,2011-08-09 12:51:00,2419,"Gorgeous pup. Is she an American or English labby. Where did you find her, as you know, im not far from you and i was looking for a chocolate about a year and a half ago. I retracted my search as things changed in life and the timing wasnt right. But ill bet you probably looked at some of the same breeders i was in contact with. There was a woman in west seneca that bred american chocolates (field labs) that i almost went with and she may be the same lady where you found yours. Just curious.  Have fun with the new addition"
610656,Billy Bob,2011-08-09 15:00:00,5865," We first went to Humehill breeder in Silver Springs....PUPPY MILL IMHO...  Then spent the rest of the day calling every ad  we could find....39 calls later and I found a family raised litter of 9....all chocolate labs in the Pittsburgh, PA area."

609448,Billy Bob,2011-08-05 15:53:00,5865,Having second thought what to name the new puppy that we will be getting in two weeks......she's a female Chocolate Lab.  But if you have some better names I am willing to consider them.  Bob

609461,mercman,2011-08-05 16:15:00,7054,"Bob, a long time ago, you told me you would call her Tundra. Stick with your first thoughts.Besides, Remmington is a male sounding name."

609621,BillM,2011-08-06 00:34:00,17367,Both 'Tundra' and 'Remington' aren't very feminine.  Poor dog is going to have a complex..

609641,Teressa,2011-08-06 02:03:00,55,"  I totally agree with Chris, when you bring her home, you may stumble across the perfect name.  For example when we got our miniature poodle, we brought her home and the 3 of us each got to say a name we thought suited her...can't remember what mine & my boyfriends name choices were, but my daughter chose Brandy and it suited her perfectly...it just felt right.  Same thing happened with my daughter's toy poodle, we brought him home and she went through about 3 names and decided he seemed like a ""cosmo"", again, a perfect fit.  Our oldest toy poodle/bichon was 6 years old when we adopted her and was already named Angel, but it does suit her too.  We do occasionally call them other names, like when Brandy ate all the cables in the house + my rose bushes ect...or Cosmo shredded my daughters report card (ya, i'm wondering if he took the blame for her LOL), Thankfully neither of them do that stuff anymore. It was just a coincidence that it turned out to be A,B & C  What ever you name her, I am 100% sure it will be perfect."
