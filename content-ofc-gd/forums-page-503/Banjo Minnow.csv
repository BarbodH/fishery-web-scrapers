610393,fishinmortician,2011-08-08 23:28:00,100,I've seen the Banjo Minnow advertised for years and was wondering if anyone has ever purchased the kit.  Contiplating the purchase.  Any suggestions????
610397,irishfield,2011-08-08 23:34:00,26272,Hey Roy... you wanna handle this one!
610404,Nipfisher,2011-08-08 23:41:00,2449,GIMICK!
610424,Garry2Rs,2011-08-09 00:27:00,1425,"I have a friend, who is an excellent fisherman, and swears by the Banjo Minnow for pike and small mouth."
610435,lookinforwalleye,2011-08-09 01:03:00,4399,looks like every other plastic jerk bait!!!  BTW Roy is a closet Banjo fan!!!
610444,ehg,2011-08-09 01:22:00,2666," Not that i ever bought one, but i should. Have a friend as well that catches lots of pike and smallies on them. You need to use their hooks and little setup and the minnow darts around nicely or sinks like a senko if left alone. The naysayers have obviously not used them. Blk/slv colour is best."
610476,corvette1,2011-08-09 02:34:00,1765,i cought a 16 lb walleye from the bay of quinte on the banjo that day we got 16 walleye not a bad day for a gimick
610479,Jds63,2011-08-09 02:40:00,1365,"I used them and did amazing ... the action was true , like a dying minnow, still have a few left from the years and use them sparingly now , but they still catch bass, but then again so does a lot of other baits ....."
610481,Freshtrax,2011-08-09 02:45:00,2215,"Deadly icefishing for lakers,...those that dont belive me dont try jigging lipless crankbaits either. It dosent work"
610508,fishing n autograph,2011-08-09 03:34:00,2540,Never caught a thing with them....then again there are no fish in the conestoga river lol
610565,aplumma,2011-08-09 11:30:00,6896,I have had a blast with them on bass down here. I bought them for up North but what I found was the pike would grab the body of the lure and since the hook is out in front of the bait it was lots of bites few hook ups. I guess with a stinger hook it would catch them but I was on vacation and that would be like work.   Art
610571,Garry2Rs,2011-08-09 12:08:00,1425,"My friend told me that he doesn't think colour is very important because they all seem to work. He like the big ones and has been trying light wire leaders because of bite offs. He uses them on spinning tackle and basically fishes them with a dead drop, then short hops, like a T-rigged Senko. There is a Banjo Minnow web site with ""how to"" videos."
610575,Roy,2011-08-09 12:32:00,13728," You should change your name to ""Lookinfortrouble"""
610576,johnnyb,2011-08-09 12:37:00,3413,"When you look at the bait, and its action in the water, it's pretty obvious that it will catch fish.  What's annoying about the thing is how it's marketed....it shouldn't matter, but for some reason, the banjo just strikes that certain cord....or twang..."
610587,cityfisher,2011-08-09 13:11:00,959,They catch bass plain and simple...i used them years ago...
610691,mattp33,2011-08-09 16:02:00,290,"I used them when i was a kid, easy to learn to use and was a great intro for using other baits like it.  I fould that because the hook is at the far front it is hard to hook up sometime.  Pike just inhale the things tho!  If you have never used them, then the only way to know is to TRY THEM!  I remember when i was a kid and saw the infomercial for them and I went RUNNING to my mom and begged for days for her credit card number.   After 3 days of constant nagging I finally ordered my first infomercial product!  When i saw them at basspro, all my great memories came flooding back!"
610704,daryl0815,2011-08-09 16:33:00,225,"My wife bought me a kit from some place, and I havent tried them, I always thought the rig looked kind of silly with the hook way out front. With all of these comments I might just have to give them a shot!"
610714,jedimaster,2011-08-09 16:55:00,3472,I got a kit as a christmas present last year but I have yet to try them. I made the mistake of watching the DVD and the advertising turned me off.
610720,Nipfisher,2011-08-09 17:08:00,2449,THis is the thread from April 2011. Same responses. lol.  http://www.ontariofishingcommunity.com/forums/index.php?showtopic=53068    So far Corvette is the only one to mention walleye with them. I don't much care for bass. Up here you can probably catch smallies with a popsicle stick or even a marshmallow.
