609130,scugpg,2011-08-04 13:33:00,1373,Please take me fishing!  Great job you guys
609140,Jigs,2011-08-04 14:29:00,136,Holy jumpin those are some beautiful fish. Really cool that you caught that jumbo walleye on a jerkbait that must have been quite the rush. One of the nicest walleye pics I've seen in a long time. Can't get over how dark its colours are.  Great stuff congrats.
609144,cl_fishin,2011-08-04 14:48:00,138,"Greats pics, some very nice fish!"

610453,ehg,2011-08-09 01:34:00,2666,Always nice quality reports from youse guys. Maybe the summer/fall report will have some muskies. Many thanks for post.
610584,johnnyb,2011-08-09 13:00:00,3413,Great stuff as usual guys....the big bass are coming....found a couple last week in some of the water that we share   Man those pics are insane!  Keep'em coming
608445,WeedLine,2011-08-01 23:53:00,322,"Hey guys/gals, I just wanted to share some pics with you from this past spring and summer. It has been a great year so far. Lots of trout, pike, walleye and bass have been landed/boated. MSP and I paid our dues this year by spending 12-14hr days on the water on many occasions. Big fish don't come easy. Black flies, mosquitos, broken wrists, hangovers, sore joints, bad sunburns and hooks buried in the hand were all part of the fishing this year. Many unproductive hours of casting were paid back in many very productive spans of unbelievable catching. Trout opener and a couple weeks after were amazing for huge numbers of hard fighting steelhead.   "
608462,WeedLine,2011-08-02 00:27:00,322,"       Then came the pike and walleye. We took off for the May 24 weekend and hit 3 different lakes. We had a good time to say the least   This fish squirted loose roe all over the boat     This beast smashed a jerk bait. She was hanging out on a chunk rock point. I thiught she was a big laker when I saw and felt the huge sweeping headshakes. When I first saw that it was a walleye, I couldn't believe it. This blue-finned beauty is the biggest non Bay of Quinte walleye I have ever seen. She swam away strong. An hour before I got this fish, I hooked and lost an absolute massive pike(25-30lb range)The walleye eased the pain of losing the pike.  We went out for musky opener. There was a crazy lightning storm going on that day. I have fished in storms many times before but I have never experienced such a small window of some of the most exciting, hard hitting pike fishing in my life. for 1.5hrs we boated so many pike. Here are the best 5 we caught. Oh, the muskies weren't biting but the blackflies were    Big head beast      We fished a few half days for kawartha walleye. 30-40 fish days were the norm. No really big ones though    5.photobucket.com/albums/oo96/fishfinder1977/022.jpg[/img] So, on to my favorite season, bass. We have been catching great numbers this year but nothing huge either so far. There's still many weekends left though   I'm really happy for MSP. He caught his biggest pike this spring. Good job buddy   Usually loons are pretty elusive and don't get too close unless they are chasing down your bait. This guy followed us around for 20 mins. I hand fed him some lunch meat but he prefered live smallmouth bass. If they were dead he wouldn't eat them but if I un hooked them and hand fed him, he would eat them. Weird.The lake is quite remote. I wonder if he has been trained by local cottagers or he was just bold. I hope you ejoyed the pics. Good luck this summer and fall. All fish were caught within 300kms from Toronto. Only some small walleye were kept. Everything else is still out there for you to catch   I always thought that loons were black, but seeing this guy up so close I learned that they are a deep, dark green."
608473,WeedLine,2011-08-02 00:35:00,322,I'm sure MSP has some pics too

Well actually all the fish are impressive  That's crazy about that loon, he was either tought that or was very, very hungry.  Pretty cool that he came right up to you and let you feed it  Thanks for the report."
