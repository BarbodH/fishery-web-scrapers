610319,bucktail,2011-08-08 18:31:00,1857,Got this guy a few weeks ago in the blue zone. It looks like a coho but the kype is WAYYY early in developing and it was bigger around then long. Just kind of a weird lookin fish.  Coho I guess.  
610322,wallacio,2011-08-08 18:39:00,475,"Nice fish!   It's definitely a Coho - the white gums are a dead giveaway (Chinooks have black gums).   Interestingly, I find Coho often have a greenish colour over their eyes - your fish has this."
610328,Spiel,2011-08-08 18:58:00,9065,Definitely a Coho IMHO.
610334,Joeytier,2011-08-08 19:27:00,3990,"Definitely a coho.  Easiest way to tell for me (aside from the green back) is the black tongue, but the rest of the mouth is usually white.  Awesome fish btw!"
610335,Squid,2011-08-08 19:32:00,1656,Nice fish Darren!!
610338,misfish,2011-08-08 19:56:00,29133,Thats a pig Darren. Very nice.
610342,myot,2011-08-08 20:15:00,131,Coho always get a Kype in thier last year of life cycle if thier male I have caught them in April with Kypes  Dan
610455,craigdritchie,2011-08-09 01:37:00,1586,"Looking at the girth on that guy, I'd say that is one very successful coho. Reminds me of the ones we used to catch in the late 70s. They were shaped more like smallmouth than salmon."
610551,highdrifter,2011-08-09 07:16:00,2534,OH MY GAWD IT'S AN ATLANTIC!!
610563,DT10Sam,2011-08-09 11:23:00,480,Very nice coho and a football at that.
