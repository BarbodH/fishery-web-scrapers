610965,Terry,2011-08-10 11:49:00,14456, agreed
610967,Whopper,2011-08-10 11:58:00,2174,"Wayne is correct. I saw this on the Sunday Morning Show, and one of the reporters from the show did a piece on this deal. I don't know about the money part (kinda of steep in my book) but I would do it. They even make you take a breathalyzer test and sign a waiver before they'll let you to the top"
610969,bubbles,2011-08-10 12:01:00,591,I'll do it if you pay.
610973,smally21,2011-08-10 12:04:00,993,"they used to rappel off the platform to raise money for charity. the ropes were over 1000' long, you couldn't even lift the end to put your rack on.  the walk looks like shakey legged fun. you're tied off, just have to keep reminding yourself!"
611000,Chance,2011-08-10 13:32:00,420,"As long as I am the one ""doin the tying on"" I would do it.Nothing worse than having the safety man give you a little smirk before you lean over!"
611005,Hooked,2011-08-10 13:45:00,891,"Quite ironic that you posted that, me and a co-worker were just watching a video on that yesterday.  Looks pretty intense but i think I'd try it....maybe."
611008,John,2011-08-10 13:51:00,2956,Couldn't get me up there. I get vertigo standing on a chair!
611009,Bob,2011-08-10 13:55:00,370,Nope!  They'd have to pay me and I wouldn't do it for $175.00.  I don't come that cheap. It'd take lots more than that just to get me into Toronto and it's my original hometown.
611012,Headhunter,2011-08-10 14:09:00,5703,"My next door neighbour is booked to do it next week... not only do they require you to do a breatalizer but also a drug test. Kinda take all the adventure out of it, if you ask me! HH"
611025,DRIFTER_016,2011-08-10 15:02:00,10439, With only $175 you ain't gonna get a good hooker an ok one but not one of them high $$$$ jobs. That's why you need the good tequila!!!!
611112,Tybo,2011-08-10 20:50:00,1373,Can't see why if you can't hang completely over the side.
611128,irishfield,2011-08-10 21:41:00,26272, I guess many around here won't be allowed on this ride... and here we all thought that after we'd reached the height requirement for the rollercoaster we were all scott free !
611132,Fishnwire,2011-08-10 21:48:00,983,$175 ?!?  No thanks.
611159,Live2fish85,2011-08-11 00:12:00,1633,I would do it. Just not for $175. I'd rather go skydiving for $250 lol.
611163,bucktail,2011-08-11 00:28:00,1857,I was thinking of doing that with my daughter!
611165,Snowball,2011-08-11 00:37:00,167,"Here is what it will look like.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfyF2qYVm-A&feature=related  Regards, Snowball"
611188,HTHM,2011-08-11 02:11:00,4082,Here footage with out the safety equipment http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_neYidAwNs&NR=1
611193,NAW,2011-08-11 02:34:00,4022," Good old Chuck Norris.. Great video.   I'd hang off the side of the CN Tower.  If it was included in my ticket price, or came with a free meal at the restaurant up there."
611208,registerfly,2011-08-11 03:13:00,198,heights give me the willies and buck seventy five is a lot of money.
610878,vinnimon,2011-08-10 01:44:00,2593,"I personally loved the big coasters in my younger years, crystall beach was my favorite, then they shut their doors. Then came canadas wonderland . Now we have this on the once tallest building in the world. I dreeded looking over the balcony way back when,and do miss the thrill now. I am conteplating wether to do it or not. Its not a fast thrill seeking attraction, but im sure most will soil their pants doing it. Would you do it? Im partial right know or just  thinking about it. "
610880,irishfield,2011-08-10 01:46:00,26272,Jen can't wait to be a little more mobile !!!
610882,danbouck,2011-08-10 01:50:00,4380,Not on my life. I've never even been up there. First scared of heights and now elevators
610885,Terry,2011-08-10 01:51:00,14456,I would do it  depending on the price and if I had more then just that as a reason to wander down to the big smoke
610886,irishfield,2011-08-10 01:52:00,26272,I believe it's $175 Terry.
610888,bushart,2011-08-10 01:53:00,2628,What is NO Alex
610891,vinnimon,2011-08-10 01:56:00,2593," Then if I decide to do it, you can watch.  I can see it know, Dans out the door on the sixth floor"
610892,Whitespinnerbait,2011-08-10 01:57:00,2038,I'm in !
610895,vinnimon,2011-08-10 02:00:00,2593,"  That would be a very good initiative on her part for other to see.Kudos to her, if she does"
610896,mercman,2011-08-10 02:01:00,7054,got shrinkage just looking at the pic
610898,vinnimon,2011-08-10 02:05:00,2593,"  Oh Paul, shes not that ugly I would date her for the thrill of it"
610904,fishing n autograph,2011-08-10 02:14:00,2540,No thanks.....not interested in that..if I wanted danger I'd eat my brother's bbq!
610912,Dave Bailey,2011-08-10 02:28:00,1641,"As I believe I've mentioned on this board before, I have flown powered aircraft, gliders, hang-gliders, and parachutes. Loved it all, no fear.  But get me two steps up a ladder and I get the shakes so bad I would even spill a beer, which for me is a mortal sin. I might try that CN Tower thingy, but there would have to be someone to push me and/or pull me around it, just in case. Oh, and Kleenex, for the tears."
610922,adolson,2011-08-10 02:44:00,783,I'd need to lose over half my current body weight before I even entertained the thought.
610923,John Bacon,2011-08-10 02:46:00,3277,I would do it; but I wouldn't pay $175 to do it.  I have always thought they should build a roller coaster that starts from the top of the CN Tower... now that would be a ride.
610924,johnnyb,2011-08-10 02:51:00,3413,"I'd do it, but I think it's overpriced."
610925,lookinforwalleye,2011-08-10 03:04:00,4399,  175!!!
610928,Dara,2011-08-10 03:06:00,3052,"No biggy...think about the crew of ironworkers that put the tower on top, and the crew that built the platform."
610932,Joey,2011-08-10 03:10:00,9122,Nope!!
610938,DT10Sam,2011-08-10 03:44:00,480,Not for me and there would not be enough toilet paper to clean up the mess.
610939,DRIFTER_016,2011-08-10 03:45:00,10439, For a hundred and seventy five bucks I'd rather get a cheap hooker and a nice bottle of Tequila!!!
610943,irishfield,2011-08-10 04:19:00,26272,I think you have that backwards Dave...
610949,spinnerbaitking,2011-08-10 06:34:00,1622, X2 SBK lol
610958,cranks bait,2011-08-10 11:20:00,721,"$175 to just stand on the edge????  No way would I do that.  I am scared to death of heights, yet I always push the linits.  Heck I have looked down 12000 foot shear cliffs with no safety rope when I lived out west.  I would't even pay that price to rappel off the tower, although it would be fun"
610959,Joeytier,2011-08-10 11:24:00,3990,"Way overpriced, but I'm sure they'll make a killing off of it for many years to come.  I'd love to try it."
