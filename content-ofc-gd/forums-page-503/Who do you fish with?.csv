Is it possible for the OFC to set up a forum or section for those who are willing to either share a seat in their boat or those that are looking for a seat.  This would be open to OFC members ONLY and sharing of gas/transportation costs/ liability etc. could be resolved between the 2 parties involved  Does this appeal to anyone?  Your thoughts and ideas would be appreciated.  cheers glenn"

611037,mike rousseau,2011-08-10 15:41:00,4661,just toss up a post if your looking for someone to fish with and see what happens....  eventually you will end up with a couple more regular fishing partners...  i wouls think

Sometimes the others (if they have a boat) add you to the short list of crew they offer spots to.  Geoff"
611062,mattp33,2011-08-10 17:53:00,290,  I LOVE fishing that lake!  I used to have a cottage on it.  Its to bad that I live so far away now.  Good luck guys!
