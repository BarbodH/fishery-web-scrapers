609400,RyanT,2011-08-05 13:50:00,72,"Unless you can't get live bait... there's no point in getting Berkeley Gulp.   Might as well get actual live bait.  Same price I think... Gulp might even be more expensive.  I've seen Gulp for $20+ a tub.  Berkeley Gulp is way overrated.  Suggestions:  Spinners (Blue Fox, Mepps, etc.), Crankbaits (Big O, Wally Diver, Rapalas), Spinnerbaits, plastic grubs.  The smaller/medium sized will catch more..."
609402,BillM,2011-08-05 13:52:00,17367," I love using Gulp leeches on work harnesses..  They last so much longer then worms...  When you're in a fly-in lake and the worms are running low, gulp is a great alternative."
609421,RyanT,2011-08-05 14:55:00,72,"   Yup, exactly what GULP is great for!  I just find that it's a bit over-rated... just like the Scent sprays.  I think you can also add your own plastic grubs/minnows to GULP tub too if you run out of GULP minnows and they will get some of that GULP scent on them... not sure how well that works though.  Might just wash off the instant it hits the water?  "
609874,mike rousseau,2011-08-07 02:32:00,4661,  My biggest reason for gulp over worms...  GOBIES!!!!!!!  You can't fish worms on the st.Lawrence river any more... You can't keep bait on the hook with all the gobies... And the gobies have a hard time ripping off the gulp
609887,limeyangler,2011-08-07 05:35:00,5204,"First off i dont think you should look at this as a bait v lure situation. I think creating a dichotomyis not useful. To me bait is bait be it a living organism or a piece of painted metal. There is skill involved with most bait presentations and also times when certain baits will work better for certain conditions or species....for example...musky mike makes a good point about using live suckers later in the year for musky.  Practice and experimentation and time.....you will evolve your fishing techniques and skills repetoire this way gauranteed. 3 years ago i never fished the weeds for walleye...now i do.....3 years ago i caught lakers through the ice on large sucker minnows left to dangle....now i almost exclusively jig 4"" white tube jigs......  5 years ago i NEVER EVEN KNEW WHAT A WALLEYE WAS....LOL.  Keep doing what your doing...you'll do just fine.   Someone mentioned getting a 'mepps aglia'....I WOULD ALSO RECOMMEND THIS!"
609932,danbouck,2011-08-07 15:18:00,4380,"Live bait is great, but what if the fish want worms and you have minnows or they want crayfish and you have worms and so on. Artificial is sometimes best because you have a bunch of different lures and you most likely have something they want.  This year i have had amazing days for bass with minnows and other days i've had amazing days with only lures."
610278,manitoubass2,2011-08-08 17:20:00,11391,"MichaelAngelo,  I fish from shore alot, I can offer some thoughts and advice. First off, I grew up fishing from a boat, and still do. But these days I actually take alot of pride in shore fishing. If you pratice alot, the next time you get into a boat you'll be alot better of an angler. Shore fishing really makes the angler learn alot about the fish, the water, the rods and reels, terminal tackle etc.  - The water you'll be fishing will determine alot. Is it heavy current, like found in a river? Is it a small calm lake? Is the water clear, muddy etc. Is it deep, shallow, weedy, rocky, both??? Learn the water as much as possible.  - I like to fish a spot heavy, learn everything I can about that spot. Remember where you snag, what you snag, what type of bait or retrieve snagged at that spot. Often times when a person snags, they just move to another spot. Not me, if there is fish there, just try new approaches and techniques to get around snagging.  - Have your gear ready before you leave, it helps save time and helps reduce problems like realizing your line is stretched and needs to be replaced after you travel to the spot, lol. Bring a tackle box and make sure it has what you need, like pliers, a stringer, a line cutter etc. Also bring a backpack with some food/water etc, helps you spend more time fishing.  - Split shots with a floating jig is a great rig to start out with, you shouldn't snag too much with this method. Alot of times, if you do snag, the split shot will fall off without breaking the line, and there cheap and easy to use. If you can't hit bottom with one split shot added, add another. Keep the split shots 12-16 inches away from the bait, helps the bait be presented alot better. Texas rigging larger plastics also works well, from artifial minnows, craws, leeches and worms, it works well. Just don't use it on too small a bait, like a 3"" grub.  - Slip bobbers are also good to have for certain situations.  - A shore fisherman should have a wide variety of baits, terminal tackle etc. Cranks, slashbaits, plastics of all shapes and sizes, jigs, floating jigs, wide gap hooks, swivels, frogs, top water baits, spoons etc. When you really get to know a spot, you'll learn that one bait that works great today might not work at all tomorrow, so have options. And make sure you have the terminal tackle to cover all situations, presentations, rigs etc.  - I like to take two rods. Both are 6'6"". Big enough to cast far and handle big fish, but not so big they make casting a chore, nore so small you can barely cast 20ft or lose fish by not being able to properly set the hook. One rod has a softer tip, and I use this rod mainly for jig fishing and other more finesse presentations. I like to have that spooled with 8lb mono. It also has a large reel because you will go through line fairly quickly fishing from shore. The other rod is a little stiffer, and its spooled with 15lb-20lb braid. This rod I use for crank baits etc. Braid gives more sensitivity, as well as offering a better chance at retrieving snagged cranks. I like Suffix 832, but there are tons of good braids out there. Also, when using braid, try to avoid casting into a headwind as much as possible. I have spinning gear on each rod, much more adaptable to shore fishing.  - If the water is muddy, use dark baits. Black is my favorite color in muddy water, but other dark colors will work, as well as vibrant colors, like chartruesse. In clear water, natural patterns are your best bet.  - If your in moderate to heavy current, try to cast straight out or with the current. It will take a slower retrieve with the current, but you wont snag as often as casting into the current. You'll also have to aim your cast in a manner that gets the bait where you want it to be. Let the current be your friend and just use your best judgment to guess where the bait will end up. After a while it's pretty easy, just takes some getting used to. Don't cast crank baits into the current head on, the lure loses all it action.  - Use snap swivels where you can, especially when your experimenting with baits and changing baits often.  - When using lead jig heads, the slowest retreive possible without snagging is the best retrieve IMO. Adding a a slight jigging motion on the retrieve should keep you snag free for the most part.  - If you snag, try not jerking the rod. Let the bait sit for a second then try to lift the bait away from the snag. If its a suspending or floating crank, same thing, let it float up and above the snag before beginning your retrieve. If you have to break your line, dont jerk like crazy trying to remove it. Grab the line with your reeling hand, and take a few step directly backwards. If it breaks, it will break at the knot and you wont stretch the line or lose a whole bunch of line.  - I like the palomar knot, its strong and easy to tie. Learn it and practice it a few times at home. After awhile you'll be able to tie it with your eyes closed, or at nightime while fishing, lol.  Anyhow, I'm sure I'm leaving a bunch out, but this is all I got for now. If you have any other questions feel free to pm me and I'll do my best to help out!  "
610287,manitoubass2,2011-08-08 17:47:00,11391,"A few other quick tips.  If your using a crank, keeping the rod tip down or parallel to the ground will help the lure run a little deeper. Gently raise the rod tip and slow the retrieve near shore if it gets shallow or snaggy.  Same when jig fishing. Keep the rod tip down abit to allow for some room for a solid hookset. If you have the rod tip too high when a fish takes the bait, you'll have a hard time landing the fish, especially a bass that comes running right at you. If bass fishing, do a search about reel sets, works really well at times while shore fishing, especially if you have a little leverage, like standing up on an elevated rock or something.  Wear good polarized glasses as well, it helps alot.  If you can, bring a net. Landing larger fish from shore can be tough work, so be prepared. Having a net also helps you release the fish properly, without harming it. Don't drag fish on shore or let them flop around on shore a bunch then release it."
610431,d_paluch,2011-08-09 00:44:00,343,Without a doubt the most informative thread I have read in a while. Dont have much to add so ill sit back and take this amazing info in

610722,manitoubass2,2011-08-09 17:18:00,11391,"and as for soft plastic baits, again, carry alot of variety,  sizes colors etc. Scented baits work well in muddy or stained water.  As for Gulp! and Trigger X and other scented baits, they work. As much debate as there is about them, they do work, and when fished properly, are definitely as effective as live bait. And shore angling requires the bait to stay on the hook, lol, and this is another advantage of these baits. Try casting 125ft from shore with a minnow on a jig head, you'll be lucky to get 3 casts with that minnow. Gulp! minnow on the other hand you could cast all day, or catch 5-6 fish on one bait at times. They can also be re-used, big plus.  If you buy Gulp! or Trigger X baits, they leak though, and they stink. I don't even keep them in my tackle box. I put the bag into another zip lock bag, then put all my scented baits in a big plastic bag, then it goes in my backpack.  Also, with cranks, if your fishing a snaggy, rocky area, you can remove the rear treble hook to reduce snags.  When fanning out an area with casts, count the time it takes to hit bottom(when the line goes slack). I count a 1-1000 in my head. Make mental notes about a change in water depth. If you find a drop off of even 2-3ft, this is a good target area to fish. Changes in structure, depth etc hold fish alot of times. If there is current, look for current seams to cast in, or around. Same with eddies or rock boils. These are important areas to fish to be successful. Remember, from shore there is no depth finder to locate fish, so learn to notice these areas to fish. If you can spot baitfish, even better, this is a great sign fish will be in the area.  If your bass fishing, when your retrieve gets close to shore, slow down if your can. Alot of good fish are either located on the shore, or follow your bait to shore. When the fish thinks its too close to shore or its gonna escape, this often triggers a bite.  And big pike will also be located right at shore in the right conditions/ time of year, so dont be surprised when a big bite comes in 18"" of water! Alsways be mentally ready to set the hook, even when you assume the last cast was unsuccessful.  I'm sure I'll think of some more, but thats it for now, lol"
610732,manitoubass2,2011-08-09 17:45:00,11391,"and where a watch, keep track of time. As you learn a spot, keep track of when the fish seem to be most active. Alot of great spots are only great at certain times of day, or times of year. If you notice that the bite turns on at certain times, well, you know when to head out and be successful. If the fish only bite in the evening, you know not to go too early, etc.  For some added motivation, here are a few of my pics of fish landed from shore in the past two years! Enjoy  A good walleye from early summer, on a 3/8oz jig and plastic bait    A decent pike that fell prey to a spoon in early summer    Lil smally in the rain (on a dt6 I believe?)    Another good smallie in crappy conditions    Sturgeon, 1st cat of the day on a jig and salted YUM grub. Took an hour to land    My sons PB walleye from shore!!!    My other boys PB smallie!    Momma walleye, mid dummer last year I think.    This guy landed me in first place of the local fishing derby this spring, yep, from shore I beat out 21 boats!    and the money goes too? lol, a free beer too boot. The anglers were all very surprised I won from shore, and we shared some laughs over a beer about it    and sometimes you'll even catch a free bait, and the same bait you were already using, lol  "
610736,adolson,2011-08-09 18:04:00,783," Yep, my uncle fishes a lot and he recommended I track everything in a spreadsheet. So that's exactly what I'm doing. Every fish I catch, I write down the time, lure, weather, species, size, location, etc. I don't wear a watch, so a good thing to do is if you have a camera make sure you have the time set correctly on it, and then just have someone take a picture of each fish (be fast if you're releasing, of course), so you can easily look at the EXIF data to get the times and look at the pic to see the lure, weather, etc. Works well for me, and the info I'm tracking will likely pay off in the future.   That is so awesome! Hahaha"

608981,MichaelAngelo,2011-08-03 20:28:00,65,"My grandfather taught me how to fish, and his way of fishing is dropping a line with multiple wormed hooks to the bottom and waiting XD!  Personally, I've never had any luck with lures.  What do I mean by that?  Every fish I've ever caught has been on a worm.  I've never caught anything big/memorable and I've been fishing since I was a kid.  Yesterday and today I fished Frenchman's bay at the base of Liverpool road.  I didn't catch anything, but  yesterday the guy by the bridge caught a HUGE freshwater drum.  It was beautiful!  And he was just using a simple silver/black spoon.  That enough is proof that I'm doing it wrong and that I should learn how to use lures!  That's my story.  I'd like to hear your takes on bait vs. lures.  But either way, I want to learn how you guys catch your fish and end my dry spell!  Thanks a bunch!!! =D"
608995,adolson,2011-08-03 21:18:00,783,"If I am fishing with someone else who is anchoring and dropping a worm on a hook, I'll do that. I consider myself a newbie too, and I'm not entirely sure what else to do in these scenarios.. I sometimes cast anyhow, but usually end up hooking pike when we're going for walleye.  If I am fishing by myself (or with people who aren't ""in charge"" for lack of better term), I always use artificial lures. Once I tagged a worm onto the treble of a Williams Wobbler and I got a nice little smallmouth bass on it.  One of my friends always uses a pickerel rig with either worms or dead minnows on it. Always. Always... He saw me hook a bass on a Rapala and it jumped and at some point it got off, but he says to me, ""I didn't think you could catch fish like that."" And I asked what he meant, and he says, ""with a lure."" ... LOL  We went fishing at the Montreal River off the shore and again, pickerel rig. He caught nothing. I caught two smallmouths. He saw me working a Hula Popper and goes, ""so you just try to snag them?"" Uhh, no, that's not how it works. LOL  So we went fishing in the canoe another time. Again, he's got his pickerel rig. Doesn't even bring tackle of any kind with him, just one single pickerel rig. I caught two pike on lures, he caught nothing. Finally he says, ""Next time, I think I will try a lure."" SUCCESS!"
609005,mike rousseau,2011-08-03 22:11:00,4661,Live bait is the easy way to fish... But I find in most cases... Once you have mastered certain artificial baits... You will outfish live bait guys every time...  P.S. Gulp... Gulp... Gulp Berkly gulp and gulp alive have pretty much eliminated the need for live bait in my boat...
609011,umKthxbye,2011-08-03 22:58:00,247,"I've had no luck with live baits other then fishing for perch with worms. For me, bass and pike seem to love artificial stuff."
609028,Dabluz,2011-08-04 00:31:00,701,"I've been fishing for 60 years and use artificials, bait and flies.  All of them work but it's up to the fisherman to know the whens, whys, wheres, hows etc etc.  Most of my fishing is for brook trout, walleye, landlocked salmon and pike.  I did fish for bass when I was younger but there are no bass where I live now.  Most lures work better without bait of any kind so don't take the route of thinking that a good lure will be better with some bait added to it.  In my book, a live bait will outfish any artificial anytime....no matter what anybody thinks.  Live bait also alows the fisherman to fish without moving or even without holding his fishing rod.  It's a very relaxing way to fish.  Artificials demand that the fisherman adds movement in order for the lure to imitate a live bait.  Of course....adding movement also means that the fisherman covers more water and it's probably this reason why aritificials produce so many fish.  I've had very little sucess with artificial baits like plastic baits or dough baits etc.  Yes, I have tried them in various situations instead of live baits and the results have been very poor.  I've caught way more brook trout while slow jigging a naked Sutton spoon through the ice than with a jig and gulp minnow.  I've caught way more walleye on a plain jig baited with the front half of a dew worm than with a plastic bait of any kind.  I've even caught way more walleye on a marabou jig than with a jig/plastic combination.  There was a time when fishermen in my area were allowed to use live minnows while trolling for landlocked salmon.  This pratice has been banned because it was too successful and hurt the fish population.  Now the only live bait allowed is a worm.  However, for landlocked salmon, trolling flies outfish worms or other artificial baits.  Follow any walleye fisherman who is trolling with an artificial bait.  You will notice that when he catches a couple of walleyes in the same spot, he will stop the boat and use a jig....most often with added bait like a worm or minnow."
609029,Dabluz,2011-08-04 00:37:00,701, I have never caught any fish with Gulp scent or bait.  The guys that come fishing with me quickly put away their Gulp baits.
609032,OhioFisherman,2011-08-04 00:44:00,6623,"Most of my fishing the last 40 years was using lures, it takes an investment of time to learn how and what to use, some lures are multi-species, others limit you. Probably one of the easiest lures for a newbie with them to use is a white 3 inch plastic twister tail fished on a jighead."
609039,Stef,2011-08-04 01:06:00,63,"Thats a great lure but it takes some skill to use properly and MichaelAngelo might loose quite a few fishing from shore.....  A lot depends on how well you can cast out and retrieve, what rod and reel you have and what fish are in the water you plan to fish.  I would suggest stay with the worms first, go to a tackle store and buy some floating jig heads (just ask, they'll know) and some split shot sinkers, big enough to get some weight to cast and keep the hook down.  The store should be able to help you with the size.  Go on the net and find instructions on how to tie a double clinch knot, practice and then tie on one of the jig heads (they are a hook with a hard styrofoam head that floats it off he bottom).	Pinch on one of the split shot about a foot up the line, if its to light to cast add another split shot beside the first.  Put on a small worm and cast out smoothly, let it sink and then retrieve it back along bottom.  Fan cast the area in front of you to cover as much of the water as possible and then move.  Look for deeper water or places where the weeds don't snag you up all the time.  That rig should get you into most types of fish, large and small.  Once you can cast easy you can try a spoon or a small spinner bait, etc.   Good luck......."
609045,trevy727,2011-08-04 01:16:00,351,"Go buy a mepps aglia spinner. They catch pike, bass, perch, walleye, Muskie, and trout and all you have to do is, cast out, and reel in. I think it would be the best lure for anyone just starting out. I like gold and red for sunny days and silver blade for overcast days."
609046,mike rousseau,2011-08-04 01:18:00,4661,..
609057,ctranter,2011-08-04 01:32:00,543," I agree, but it also depends on the species that we're talking about.  Steelhead live roe vs artificial?  Obviously there is a huge discrepancy based on the feeding habits of the fish we are discussing.  I've never felt that live bait was necessary for Bass, Pike or Musky, but I DO consider live bait necessary for Trout, Walleye, and Ice fishing.  When I started learning about hatch cycles and bait matching with flies, it became abundantly clear that the same could be done with flies for other foraging habits.  Throughout my summer bass days, I fish water that have Crayfish, Sunfish, Perch, and small Bass as bait for bigger species, and I have flies that almost perfectly match each presentation.  The real challenge is making artificials look real and this is where masterful fishing takes place."
609058,mercman,2011-08-04 01:33:00,7054,"  Been fishing my area with live bait for a couple of years.I catch, but not in a consistent manner.A few walleye, some perch, the odd Smallie.Always catch something, but not necesarilly what i am after. Brother came into town last weekend. Never ever fished this water, Popped a gulp split tail minnow on a texas rigged hook, and smoked 2 smallies in 15 minutes, 1 over 3 lbs. I caught ZIP. So if you are not catching on Gulp or plastics, you are not fishing them correctly.They have to be fished so slow, it may seem boring."
609060,mike rousseau,2011-08-04 01:39:00,4661, very true...  and im also on a big river where there is always current... i cant fish a 1/8 ounce jig and minnow for walleye like in the north lakes... i can drift or troll a lindy rig but that style of fishing is a bit slow for me...  and in the fall... i switch to big live suckers for musky... cause they arent willing to chase down artificials...
609061,Dabluz,2011-08-04 01:46:00,701," Oh....I fish slow.  Even very slow.  I also fish light.  I use 4 and 6 lb mono when fishing with a jig for walleye.  I also catch mucho walleye and so do the people who come with me and fish like me.  On opening day of walleye, I always go to a nearby river.  Many dozens of other fishermen are there too and the only ones who catch walleye are the ones who use worms.  Most of the early morning walleye are caught on worm harnesses and bottom bouncers.  I prefer using jigs because I find that a 2 ounce bottom bouncer is not much fun.  However, when the fishing starts to die down, I still get good results with only a 1/4 ounce black jig with the front half of a night crawler on the hook.  Yes....I once caught a nice walleye on a green and gold flecked rubber jig.  But I see close to a hundred fishermen around me who go home without any walleye or only a few walleye at the end of the day.  Some add worm to the rubber jig but they have trouble hooking a walleye.  I have tried Gulp baits many times and so have a few of my friends.  Yes they do catch a few fish but not as many as when they turn to worms."

609067,sleepjigging,2011-08-04 02:10:00,207,"I have started just started to move into lures from worms and minnows this year. Fact is: worms and minnows will always catch something. However, if you watch a school of fish go after a little worm, it's the small aggressive sunfish that rushes in and swallows it first. I have realized that to catch something bigger, it's better to give them something that the little fishies can't eat. I used to catch lots of sunfish and rockbass using live bait. Now I use an artificial frog (kicker frog - about 5"" long). The bigger fish love it - bass and pike.  Secondly, what ever you use, it helps to have fish in the water. Your best bait will catch nothing in your toilet.  Jiggy"
609068,BillM,2011-08-04 02:26:00,17367,"Only time I use live bait is worms or leeches on harnesses/jigging for walleyes...  Emerald shiners in the winter for perch/whities and the odd worm for trout early in the season.  Whatever catches the fish I'll use, I'm not a bait snob, lol."
609070,woodenboater,2011-08-04 02:43:00,2277,"I use either depending on my whims that day  A wooly bugger on a 6 hook has been a favorite for bass on fly gear as has a countdown Rapala on ultralight. Last time on the French, a worm hung on a hook below a float produced smb and a nice pike although I prefer flashy spinnerbaits for the toothy fish. Also got lots of perch and sunfish as well unfortunately. Just got some Gulp grubs to try out so will see if they'll become a regular part of my kit."

609269,MichaelAngelo,2011-08-04 21:27:00,65,"Thanks everyone for the advice so far!    Thanks for the simple, straight-forward advice.  I don't think I've ever gone fishing without having to cut my line at least once.  That's a big reason why I've kept my tackle cheap.  Not snagging on weeds, but on other unseen things like underwater garbage and underwater wood.  Do all shore anglers have this problem?  Why the floating jig heads as apposed to the sinking jig heads?     I'd love it if you were more specific.  ""Once I learned how to use them"", but how'd you learn how to use them, what did you do differently?   Thanks again =P  The more detailed the advice is, the better.  So guys lemme hear all your details!"
609275,Rod Caster,2011-08-04 22:02:00,5784," Shore fisherman lose much more tackle because you are generally pulling your lure from deep to shallow water, right into the fissure of a rock, or under logs etc. .. In a boat its generally shallow to deep water... And if u get snagged you can move the boat around to release the snag.  With lead (or other metal) jigs heads, I find it helps to gently ""hop"" the lure on bottom as you retrieve at your desired speed. Keep the lure moving (rod tip up and down, maybe 6inches per hop) and you can also fish a bit slower. This will reduce your snagging by a fair amount."
609340,Stef,2011-08-05 02:11:00,63," The floating jig head helps to keep the bait off bottom as it floats above the sinkers, less snags.  The sinkers can still snag but you're success rate in pulling them free is higher, a lot of times you will simply strip the sinker off the line.  The advantage to casting is you cover more water than letting a bait just sit and it gets you practice casting and retrieving.  Because a floating jig has only one hook, covered by worm, it is less prone to snag weeds than a lure with a treble hook (three hooks in a gang).  Plus, its a darn effective way to catch fish.  Fishing a lead jig requires you to ""hop"" it back and each time it hits the bottom it wants to bury itself into whatever is down there.  With practice you develop a feel for what is happening, once you can feel weeds, hard bottom, soft bottom with a floater, and learn to maneuver your bait by varying your speed of retrieve or lifting the rod tip, try a lead head.  Shore fishing is tough on tackle......."

However, there are some holes where I find certain species to go after artificial more than worms. So far I've caught crappie, bluegill, pumpkinseed, rockbass, and pike on artificials, and it's really this year that I've decided to stick to them, especially since it's a bit difficult to bring minnows on the TTC and you can cover a lot of water as a shore angler. Use spoons and mepps in the spring for pike and you will have success, just a simple retrieve is all you need. I've also found the little gulp minnows (1 inch) pretty good when the fish were more lethargic and refusing my other artificials, but it's a pain in the ass since the container isn't exactly leak proof. Definitely on my list this year is salmon, as I've only hooked into them on roe."

You need to understand when each one has its place and make your decision accordingly.  Read everything you can about fishing. TV shows can be helpful, but you'll find better information in books. See if you can find the old Hunting & Fishing LIbrary series of hardcovers, which were published by Cy Decosse in the 1990s (click here to see some of them). They were outstanding.  This one is pretty good too."

When I take the kids out with me we usually go with live bait  be it minnows ,leeches or worms dropped over the side of the boat.It can get ugly with 3 kids tossing lures.If it is just me and maybe one other nothing beats tossing topwaters or minnow baits over rocky shorelines or along weedlines."
