I'm curious if anyone knows any good places to go off the shore there? I'm mostly looking for bass, walleye, pike, trout, whatever can be had from shore - not too picky. Not a catfish fan, though.  One thing I know: under the bridge might not be a great idea. My brother went not long ago, and he landed the following with 10lb test:       That last one weighed in at about 43lbs! Not too shabby.  Anyhow, suggestions?"
