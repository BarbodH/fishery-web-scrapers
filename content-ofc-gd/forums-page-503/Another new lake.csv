609687,Rod Caster,2011-08-06 04:45:00,5784,"JoeyTier and I tried another new lake that apparently holds walleye, bass and pike. This was a completly quiet and under fished lake with only one run down cottage on the entire shoreline. We forced our way through some very thin, hardly used trails and launched the canoe at the end of this long and thin lake. Both of us were hoping to land some walleye but the bass were the only ones that wanted to cooperate. We trolled deep with jigs and harnesses and also did some casting towards shore. At one point we stopped on shore for a quick, no dishes snack and took a little break before heading out for the evening bite. Here are the photos and results from our day.  Joey with the machete, clearing away large sticks.    The truck barely made it! haha    A fair size SMB... I landed a couple this size and several smaller.    Shore lunch with cheddar sausages.    Big bass of the day! 17"", probably 3 pounds. I was very happy to get this guy!!    Scenery  "
609705,cheaptackle,2011-08-06 10:43:00,849,New (different?) Canoe?  Thought you were running an old Sportspal?  Looks like a great day!  Michael
609710,mercman,2011-08-06 12:13:00,7054,"Man, that looks like an awesome, pristine lake. If it holds a 3lb smallie like that, just imagine what else it has in store for you. Keep that place a secret for sure"
609711,Rod Caster,2011-08-06 12:18:00,5784," Hey Mike, haven't heard from you in awhile, hope all's well! This canoe is my dad's toy, I have to plug some holes in the 'pal, so he let me use the Kevlar... Its a Cadillac compared to the ol' tin box."
609742,Jer,2011-08-06 13:50:00,1426,"Not too worried about the paint job on that Mazda, I guess.  Beauty spot you found there."
609753,MichaelAngelo,2011-08-06 14:56:00,65,"Huge props on you guys!  You're exploring, offroading, canoeing, surviving and fishing.  Sound like a heck of an adventure!"
609756,Rod Caster,2011-08-06 15:09:00,5784,"  Surviving indeed... at one point the canoe came untied as we were eating lunch. Cell phone, camera, hat, glasses quickly on dry ground and splash in I went to chase the canoe in a strong wind. 20 more seconds and I'd have been swimming for a hundred meters or more.  I hope you use better fishing knots Joey"
609800,Nipfisher,2011-08-06 18:51:00,2449,I'll have to join you on one of these adventures.
609803,splashhopper,2011-08-06 19:13:00,2931,looks like pure heaven
609835,cheaptackle,2011-08-06 23:25:00,849,"Daddy to the rescue again eh?  Good thing he trusts y'all with his toys. Real slow summer down here, finally broke down, decided to put less time in until the fall, renewed my license and started doing some exploring locally.  Might even see if my tinny floats this week!  Michael"
609865,limeyangler,2011-08-07 01:55:00,5204,  LOL Jer....exactly what i thought!  I gave up worrying about the paint job on my truck...way to stressful...its a truck...thats what it does!   Great report JT....one day i will do some off road adventures too...just collecting all the gadgets still.   Cool pics too.
609871,Rod Caster,2011-08-07 02:19:00,5784,"Haha, its a 2010 with ten years worth of scratches on it. The first time I scratched it was difficult but it got easier after that."
610011,Black_Blade,2011-08-07 21:55:00,258,"Nice post, now thats the kind of fishing I'd like to get into...getting back into those seldom fished lakes.  Nice fish too!"
610034,Joeytier,2011-08-07 23:17:00,3990,"I can assure you, we fish with less gadgets than what you already have."
610037,danc,2011-08-07 23:27:00,4677,Nice job guys. It's always nice when you put a little work into things and it all works out.
