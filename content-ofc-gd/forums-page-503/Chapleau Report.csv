610851,hoosier,2011-08-10 00:52:00,29,Spent last week fishing in the Chapleau area with my two sons. Caught most of the fish in 5 to 15 feet of water. A simple hook and worm either on bottom or under a float produced best for us. Here are a few pictures.

610859,hoosier,2011-08-10 01:03:00,29,We were actually on Windermere. Very scenic and plenty of elbow room. We did not try for lakers. A few people in camp were trying but I think they got skunked.
610862,NAW,2011-08-10 01:07:00,4022,Right on man. Great time with the fam.

610874,10point,2011-08-10 01:42:00,165,"Nice, but BoilerUp! I was up at Dog Lake in June which I believe is in the same area."
610884,Krisco,2011-08-10 01:50:00,67,"Aww the falls, I was just there myself a fews weeks ago and can't wait to go back. Looks like you guys had a good time. Were you camping or did you stay down at Happy Days?"

610910,ehg,2011-08-10 02:24:00,2666,Looks like the fishing was great. What an awesome trip for the kids.  The bald eagles are showing up in the Ontario reports all over this year.  Good stuff!
610927,cl_fishin,2011-08-10 03:06:00,138,"Great pics, those smallies are fat, I spend alot of time in the area as well. Headed up end of August and again in late Sept can't wait!"

610970,Whopper,2011-08-10 12:03:00,2174,Awesome outing with your boys Reds fan.  It's a trip I'm sure they will remember for years to come
610971,bubbles,2011-08-10 12:03:00,591,"Love it!  One of my favorite areas, 29 days and counting!"
610974,Roy,2011-08-10 12:07:00,13728,Impressive! And the boys look pretty happy too! What a great area that is. Thanks for sharing.  ps. I winced when I saw the lad with his knee on the swivel seat and an open tackle box right below him. But I probably see accidents where there aren't any.
610991,Billy Bob,2011-08-10 12:53:00,5865,"Nice boat, good looking boys, great trip........thanks for sharing.  Bob"
611015,hoosier,2011-08-10 14:13:00,29,  Boiler up - NEVER! But seriously hopefully IU can get back up to Purdue's level and get the rivalry back to the way it use to be with both teams being good.
611016,hoosier,2011-08-10 14:14:00,29, We were at Happy Day Lodge. It was our first time and we were very satisfied with their operation.
611017,hoosier,2011-08-10 14:15:00,29,  Never thought of the tackle box Roy. Good point. I'll keep it in mind.
611018,hoosier,2011-08-10 14:16:00,29, Wish I had a boat like that but sadly it was just ours for the week.
611019,stasbrute,2011-08-10 14:23:00,206,"Beauty!! I love it up there, nice fish!!!"
611020,ccmtcanada,2011-08-10 14:40:00,7971,Great report!  Gotta love it when kids get into things other than panfish...looks like a great time was had!
611160,jaggersr,2011-08-11 00:17:00,9,"Bob, Sondra and the boys are great people.  Wife and I were there in June. Son and I are leaving Friday for another week of fishing and chasing bears. The wife doesn't hunt so she and I will be heading up again in Sept. We always fish grazing for walleye. While I love walleye fishing and our shore lunches, I have to admit the smallie fishing is what keeps drawing me back. One of these days I am going to target Lakers, but it always seems we are busy chasing walleye and smallmouth."
