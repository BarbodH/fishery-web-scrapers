If you don't, its like POV.  For the best quality, try watching the video in 720p and full screen.    The videos are relatively very short, the size of these new HD files are very hard to work with. I'll try to include actual sound and longer video next time. Stay tuned! Equipment: GoPro HDHero in r4 setting (960p 1280X960)"

Please don't take this the wrong way, it looks like you got some high priced equipment there. Thanks for the video. That was cool!  Cheers, Slayer"

610808,Pikeslayer,2011-08-09 22:47:00,1443,"Looks to me like the proof is in the winning, but I see either a snapped rod or limb in young grasshopper's future. Nice to see you back Geoff. Now get busy and add our 60"" of upgrades.  Simon"
