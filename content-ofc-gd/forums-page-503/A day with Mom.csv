610140,bigugli,2011-08-08 02:57:00,6138,"This year, both our birthdays zipped by with out our being able to see each other and go fishing. So I booked us a date up at L Dalrymple, and rented a boat. Mom would provide a ""simple"" picnic basket. Even the son chose to join in. It was a great day and the rain held out till the end. Mom got the front of the boat and Rob got to sit in the stern sheets. They were able to cast spinnerbaits in every direction and attract several pike.  Pike everywhere.     Meanwhile I was sitting in the middle. We had a trolling motor with a cooked battery, so i beacame the human trolling motor. Would have been OK if the oars were in good repair. Mismatched in sizes, the one oar lock was loose, slipping up and down the oar. The receiver for the thole pin was missing it' s collar. It was quite the comical experience to watch me row to keep station on the fish, while also drifting harnesses. Even so I managed my new pb on crappie with a whopping 14"" specimen.  Later I would get a nice smallie on a harness and my ultralite rod  There were lots of big sunnies and, of course, decent sized WGSF.  Did I mention thaty the bass were kinda skittish? Managed all of 4 for the day.  I am now whooped and pooped."
