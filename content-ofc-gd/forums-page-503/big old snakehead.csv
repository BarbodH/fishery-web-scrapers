610230,Freshtrax,2011-08-08 15:01:00,2215,"Was fishing in the holland river yesterday for pike.. We caught a few little ones but my girfriend angela caught a 29"" snakehead nasty looking creature. I didnt know they were in simcoe."
610237,salmon,2011-08-08 15:12:00,334,"no pics,  probably a bowfin"
610238,Spiel,2011-08-08 15:16:00,9065, Probably and most certainly.  
610241,BillM,2011-08-08 15:21:00,17367,Wasn't there an article about some lady up on the Saugeen who thought she caught a snakehead?  lol!!!
610284,Freshtrax,2011-08-08 17:42:00,2215,Yep that's the one..no spot on it. Slightly squarer tail..but that's it he was mean..bit right through my net lol.
610297,BillM,2011-08-08 17:57:00,17367,"They are nasty things, don't get your fingers to close to its mouth"
610315,Roy,2011-08-08 18:27:00,13728, No spot means it's an adult female. Both genders are born with the spot but the female loses it once adult.
610392,HTHM,2011-08-08 23:25:00,4082,Are they any good to eat? I really do not know.
610402,Terry,2011-08-08 23:41:00,14456,"I won't let those nasty buggers on my boat anymore, I would just cut the line if I can't get the hook out in the water"
610426,Roy,2011-08-09 00:35:00,13728,"They are JUST edible. You'd pretty well have to be starving and have nothing else to eat. I think as far as edible is concerned, a bowfin is the last thing on the list just above gnawing off your own arm."
610428,dave524,2011-08-09 00:38:00,4508,"Boil them and dip in garlic butter, taste just like lobster"
610430,Roy,2011-08-09 00:43:00,13728, There ya go!
610495,Freshtrax,2011-08-09 03:18:00,2215,Thanks for the info guys.. She took the bait deep.  There was nobody to give it to so i took it home...filleted it was different to cut up.  No bones i left the belly fat.  My sister ate it for breckfast thismorning heavily breaded cooked in butter she called me and said it wasent too bad lol.  On a side note it fought like a champ.  My girlfriend thought it was a turtle at first the way it was fighting.
610526,cram,2011-08-09 03:57:00,1733,"Call me weird, but i consider it a bonus catching them.  Fight like crazy.  Mean buggers."
610567,DT10Sam,2011-08-09 11:35:00,480,There are alot of folks that enjoy eating them once you get past their ugly looks. I still prefer walleye over those ugly things any day.
610788,Dabluz,2011-08-09 21:40:00,701,"I heard that snakeheads were excellent to eat even though they were ugly as sin.  However, bowfin are not so good to eat."
610798,mercman,2011-08-09 22:20:00,7054,  Dont say that too loud. There are lots of us who might like to take up turtle fishing in our spare time Specially if they fight like snakeheads.
