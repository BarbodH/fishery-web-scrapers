610663,dave524,2011-08-09 15:05:00,4508,So what have I learned in reading 4 pages ? If I extend the dock all the way out to the icefishing shack in winter I can drink legally in the shack
610664,Dara,2011-08-09 15:05:00,3052,"  Give your head a shake...how bout they put a bullet in his leg so he knows what its like to get shot.  My point is that HEALTH CANADA recomends limiting alcohol intake to no more that 2 drinks per day for safety reasons. Why should it then not be illegal to have more than 2 per day, you know, just to keep us safe from our own stupidity."
610665,Spiel,2011-08-09 15:06:00,9065,Is it raining across the entire province?  Same old folks spinning their tires and going nowhere!

610598,cram,2011-08-09 13:34:00,1733,"The ""dummy"" could have had 4-5 beers in him if he was 160 lbs or so.  Paddleboats go, what, 0.5 mph?  1mph?  Get that guy off the streets before he kills someone!!!!"
610599,Cookslav,2011-08-09 13:35:00,1457,"Chances are the dude was billegernt and pushed the issue, BUT.... Ya fined in a Paddle boat is rediculous. The same thing happend to a guy in a Canoe back in July on Belwood lake.... Hardly a danger to the public though....sure he could ""drift"" into a lane way, but the same could be said for a kid on a floaty. Or an idiot who simply swims into the channel(seen this several times)  On the Positive side....Impaired operation of a vessle is NOT the same as DUI If I understand correctly this guy will simply be charged, fined, and perhaps told he's not allowed to operate any ""vessles"" for a certain amount of time????  Which in its self is kind of silly, Does he need a pleasure craft license to operate a Paddle boat or canoe....  Its really more of a slap on the wrist for someone being drunk and belligerent I think, but I could be wrong...and if I am I'm sure someone will tell me"
610601,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-08-09 13:42:00,0,"without us being there, it's not fair to speculate the guy was being disorderly.  my uncle has been issued tickets on a nearby lake for having one beer in the boat while making his evening troll around the lake (not intoxicated). spare me the lecture that it's ""still illegal"" because cops have discretion on what fines they should write but they will issue any ticket possible while on field excursions like these because of the astronomical cost of fuel and officers being in the field."
610604,fishing n autograph,2011-08-09 13:44:00,2540,No he'll lose his drivers license for 90 days for the over .08mgs

610607,fishing n autograph,2011-08-09 13:47:00,2540,Cops have discretion but people also have to follow the rules
610610,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-08-09 13:54:00,0,and when the cops break the rules we'll sweep in under the carpet!
610611,Chance,2011-08-09 13:56:00,420,"He was impaired and without safety equipment on board.Accidents do happen all the time regardless of what you are operating.He got off easy,could of lost his life."
610617,Dara,2011-08-09 14:07:00,3052,  Thats rediculous.  Health Canada states that it is dangerous to your health to have more than 2 drinks in a 24 hour period. You should be charged with public intoxication and your employer should be charged with endangering a worker.
610618,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-08-09 14:07:00,0,hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha!  something tells me being sober on a jetski is far more dangerous than being drunk on a paddleboat but what do i know!
610624,Chance,2011-08-09 14:18:00,420,"As mentioned earlier bizzare and strange acidents occur daily.Many times people need protection from their own stupidity.It boils down to ""dont like the rules,dont play the game""I didnt see it mentioned in the article if the man could swim or not.He was impaired which means his decision making,reaction time,coordination etc etc was ""impaired"". I have seen intoxicated people die from falling off a bar stool so the vehicle has little to do with it.Impaired,on the water AND without safety equipment,that is the issue."
610625,Rich,2011-08-09 14:19:00,3927,"I saw on the Burnt River a few years ago a guy's son threw one of his water wings into the middle of the river. Buddy quickly jumped in his paddle boat to go get it before it drifted away. Honestly, 15 ft at most from his dock. On the way back in, OPP boat happened to be cruising the river at that time. He actually got a ticket for not having his safety equipment.  Like, I'm all about having your safety equipment but seriously, he was paddling out to grab a water wing for his son. It took him 2 minutes, spare the 20 talking to the power trip OPP. I was about 4 docks down, but I didn't see him acting belligerent or rude to the police in any way. They just wanted to hand out a ticket.  I think the laws are pretty ridiculous in some instances."
610635,fishing n autograph,2011-08-09 14:25:00,2540, really? because it was a controlled experiment operated by the centre of forensic sciences and i couldn't leave the room or building until i was at 0 and the i was cabbed to my hotel
610639,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-08-09 14:31:00,0,you could have fallen and broken your neck in that room!      you were intoxicated after all!

610642,fishing n autograph,2011-08-09 14:38:00,2540, actually according to the science geeks impairment physiologically starts at .05 lol therefore any accidents would be caused by me being the klutz that i am lol
610649,DRIFTER_016,2011-08-09 14:50:00,10439, Completely different if you ask me as the lawn tractor and golf cart are powered by motors while the peddle boat is human powered. Next thing you will see is somebody charged for being drunk while riding an innertube down the credit.
610650,Dara,2011-08-09 14:50:00,3052,"  Its not a controlled experiment. There were no doctors or scientists present. The results of the so called experiment are already known so there was no need to conduct it. You were drunk on the job and it was sanctioned by your employer. What would the ministry of labour say if I conducted an experiment on a construction site, even if it was sanctioned by management."
610651,fishing n autograph,2011-08-09 14:53:00,2540," uhh there were 4 scientists there and it was hands on training for the use of the intoxilyzer 8000c and it wasn't sanctioned by my employer it was through the centre of forensic sciences ....thanks, what else do you have?  and i wasn't onthe job, i was on a course far away from my place of employment"
610654,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-08-09 14:58:00,0,i think i'm going to conduct my own controlled experiment around the bbq tonight.  bbq walleye  anyone?  let's hope i don't get a ticket when i walk down the street to offer some to the in-laws.
610655,Dara,2011-08-09 14:58:00,3052,"  Sugar coat it all you want. Its still excessive consumption. I see no need to get drunk to see if a breathalyser works. You blow in it and it gives you a reading. 0 is as good a reading as .05 and a lot safer. The centre for forensic sciences still falls under the labour code and they got you impaired at work, therefore sanctioned by your employer."
610658,HTHM,2011-08-09 15:00:00,4082,"   The Center for Fornsic sciences???, no doctors or scientists present???? Give your head a shake. By your logic then, we should cancel all science experiments that take place in High School or college because the results are known. As for being drunk on the job, as part of a training excercise, that is just normal procedure in training someone to enforce our laws. I suppose you feel that firearms training should be done with a pointed finger and the officer yelling ""bang"" rather than using live ammunition as well."
610659,Dara,2011-08-09 15:01:00,3052,"  so you took the course on your own time for free, paid the course fees out of your own pocket...again..sugar coating"
610524,fishing n autograph,2011-08-09 03:56:00,2540,Same difference stealing $100k and a $1 chocolate bar
610525,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-08-09 03:57:00,0,i'm sorry but this is as silly as when i read about guys getting fined for being drunk on a bicycle.
610527,cram,2011-08-09 03:59:00,1733, One puts others' lives at risk.  Not sure if i'd worry about a guy in a paddleboat taking out another boat or running down kids on a sidewalk.

610530,cram,2011-08-09 04:04:00,1733,FnA - can you get a ticket for open liquor in public if you have a beer on your dock?
610531,fishing n autograph,2011-08-09 04:08:00,2540,No if its your property then the LLA doesn't apply

I posted this thread only as a joke because I thought the image of a drunk man paddling around was funny.
