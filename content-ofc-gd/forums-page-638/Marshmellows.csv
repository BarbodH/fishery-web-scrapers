499163,fishinguypat,2010-08-27 21:23:00,547,I was wondering if anyone has had any luck for salmon and trout using Atlas Mike's  Marshmellows? i have used these but never caught a fish with them that wasn't foul hooked by accident.
499165,Guest gbfisher,2010-08-27 21:41:00,0,We used to joke about shmellows with our BC friends. I wish I still had the pictures of the fish with the shmellows right down their gullet. Our BC friends started using them as well. They liked the stay puff shmellows the best.  ah shmellows.  ps....if yer foul hooking fish you aint fishing right. Nothing to do with the shmellows dude man.
499171,GBW,2010-08-27 21:57:00,8460,they make a great pink or orance with a hit of garlic smores!
499174,fishinguypat,2010-08-27 22:06:00,547, I said accidental foul hooking fish you know how it is with the salmon
499189,Guest gbfisher,2010-08-27 23:46:00,0," I know about Salmon but not sure about foul hooking them with shmellows.I'm sure you could easily do it with a treble hook. Hows the saying go?.""When I fish chinook I use trble hook."" No need for shmellows. I take it you do not catch very many salmon with shmellows by saying that the fish were foul hooked? If yer doing it consistently as one would assume by what you've said. Again, more than a couple or consistently hooking fish means you are not fishing with the proper set up."
499191,solopaddler,2010-08-28 00:00:00,8605,Didn't you ask a similar question same time last year that caused a huge ruckus?  Are you stirring the pot or do you really have such a bad memory?
499192,fishinguypat,2010-08-28 00:01:00,547, what is the proper rig with these then?
499209,bassjnkie,2010-08-28 00:46:00,1101,I guess it would go on the hook. Never used them though.
499213,ttreacy,2010-08-28 00:49:00,19,No luck for me either
499214,Guest gbfisher,2010-08-28 00:50:00,0,  http://www.californiafishingguide.com/trout_worm_fishing.htm  Hope this helps your dilemma.

499252,The JAY,2010-08-28 02:43:00,239,"When I was a kid, we used to float around Bronte harbour and catch salmon with marshmallows on little trebles. No foul hooking, caught them fair and square... Nice time was had by me anyway...."
499254,steelhead hunter,2010-08-28 02:49:00,152,ya he did start the same thing last year some people just don't learn
499258,chessy,2010-08-28 03:03:00,610,we use marshmellow with spawn we tie it in with the spawn and make loonie sized spawn bags and fish with them off the peirs.  the only problem is you cant make to many at a time due to they get soggy and will not keep your bag off the bottom ..
499265,fishinguypat,2010-08-28 03:19:00,547, that was a joke
