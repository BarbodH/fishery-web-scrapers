499394,bow slayer,2010-08-28 23:36:00,1074,"Could someone pass along some info on this. My motor needs the mandatory 10 hour inspection for warranty purposes,does anyone have an idea the time required for this and the cost? Does it have to be exactly 10 hrs or could it be in that area? I figure I am about at that point but was planing on a 3 day get away starting monday and will add another 2-3 hours to the motor,should I just book the service and cancel the trip or is there some lean way towards the 10 hours and do the service when I return? The manuel states what is needed and when but I am sure they don't expect it to be exactly 10 hours.I just don't want to void the 36 month warranty.I would call a dealer and ask but it might be tough to find one open now or even tommorrow.  thanks"
499479,thefireman,2010-08-29 12:40:00,51,"If you don't have an hour meter, then go fishing! I'm sure a few hours here or there won't void your warranty.  What would happen if your in the middle of the lake when the 10 hours hit. Stop and get towed home? GO FISHING!!!!  Again NO hour meter, they won't know either!"
499481,danbouck,2010-08-29 12:45:00,4380,"They will know the hours when they plug it in. I wouldn't worry about it, just go fishing and bring it in after. I took mine in for the 20 hour service and I wasn't even close.  I thought it was 3 years no maintenance"

499614,cranks bait,2010-08-29 22:53:00,721,  I have an '08 E-tec.  There was no mention of a 10 or 20 or whatever service.  They just mentioned that a service at 300 hours would be recommended.  I read the books thoroly as I didn't want to mess anything up.  It never mentioned anything about warrenty service?  I'd check with BRP directly as it sounds fishy to need a service after 10 hours.
499616,Whitespinnerbait,2010-08-29 22:59:00,2038,Keep on Fishing..........
499687,pikehunter,2010-08-30 00:53:00,1659,Don't have an ETech but a 2005 Johnson 25 hp 2 stroke. I estimated the first 10 hour break in and took it in for the inspection. The dealer was fine with it.
499708,ohhenrygsr,2010-08-30 01:26:00,947,Most dealers will recommend the customer to bring the motor back with in the first 10-20 hrs for an inspection or fluid change  if it's a brand new motor.  For Merc they recommend an oil change every 100 hrs both top and lower units or at the end of the season.  If there is a problem it would most likely occur with in the first 20 hrs of use.

499712,Bigfisherman,2010-08-30 01:33:00,100,I have a 75hp etec there is no 10hr service required. its 300hrs/3 years unless you want it done earlier
499752,bow slayer,2010-08-30 02:30:00,1074,The motor is a 4 stroke johnson brand new. It requires a 10 hr inspection to be performed by a dealer as per owners manuel.
