499138,BucktownAngler,2010-08-27 19:36:00,582,"A friend of mine is having problems with his boat.  The trim randomly stops working for the motor as well as the starter switch (Not a battery issue). Luckily we were docked and didnâ€™t get stranded.  The wiring looked shady from the beginning, but never had an issue. It appears that the previous owner did the wiring himself. He added a CD player/speakers, and marine radio.  Does anybody know of a Marina, or someone who can do a good wiring job at a reasonable price?  Thanks"
