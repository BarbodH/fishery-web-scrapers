In all honesty, I live about 15 minutes from rondeau and I have pretty well give up on the bay for the year. There was a tournament there yesterday, and if you werent flippin weed edges, you didnt catch fish !  For me, the work isnt worth the reward in there right now. I would much rather Lake St.Clair/Michells bay"
