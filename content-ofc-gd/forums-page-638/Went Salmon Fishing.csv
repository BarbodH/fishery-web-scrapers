499629,Joey,2010-08-29 23:25:00,9122,"Headed down to the big lake today for some salmon, but it seems the trout were out to play, well caught 3 trout, one shaker salmon.  We were obviously having a better day than this guy         I had the first fish on, a decent trout, but we lost it at the net (damned net boy)  Paul was up next and got a 29 incher but we didn't take a picture, then I was up and got one about the same, 28 inches.         This is our next boat        Boy, did it send some big waves our way tho         This guy was entertaining the masses at the marina.      This was our take home for the day.      When we got back to the marina, a Ministry of Natural Resources guy came over and asked how we did and if we kept any.  We told him our catch and he wanted to see the salmon.  He said they were taking stock and wanted samples of scales and to see if it was a natural fish, which it was.  He said that they figured the natural ones were going to be about 25% but were pleasantly surprised that they were coming in at 45%  Anyhow, nice day to be on the water, a bit of a breeze to keep us cool, which unfortunately lead to my nasty sunburn as it didn't feel like I was getting too much sun.  Not complaining tho  Joey"
499633,spincast,2010-08-29 23:28:00,3279,"Great day on the water Joey! Trout for supper? Nothing like getting rocked by a multi million dollar wave, eh?"
499637,icefisherman,2010-08-29 23:29:00,952,"Sorry I miss you Joey as we were in the area as well. I can see the Ministry has taken samples from your Chinook too  Didn't see the pipe guy but got to see Bob Izumi going in Too bad for the sunk boat  Cheers, Ice Fisherman"
499640,Joey,2010-08-29 23:31:00,9122,"Geez, too bad we missed seeing each other Emil, how did you make out?"

499736,Twocoda,2010-08-30 02:06:00,4130, The riggers or the bikinis???? seems to me there was lots of room for the riggers...but hardly any room for the bikinis...lol..
