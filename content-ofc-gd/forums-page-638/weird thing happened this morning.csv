499095,mercman,2010-08-27 17:55:00,7054,"was out fishing this morning with the wife. we were in the st lawerence just south of montreal in 30ft of water.i was positioning the boat into the wind and out of the blue i got a shallow depth alert !!! Lasted for about 20 seconds and then stopped and started to read 29.8 feet again. suddenly perch started jumping out of the water a few feet from the boat. that lasted for about a minute and the everything calmed down. Didnt really see a thing, but thought i saw a shadow in the stained water. anyone ever have this happene to them i know we have sturgeons here but dont know if that could make a sonar depth alert go off."
499102,lew,2010-08-27 18:16:00,12766,Coulda been one of those nasty old St. Lawrence River muskies cruising along under your boat

499113,GBW,2010-08-27 18:36:00,8460,I was thinking the same thing... I've had herring jump out of the water like crazy before in a known walley spot on the lake.
499132,bare foot wader,2010-08-27 19:23:00,1354,"predatory fish pushing prey to the surface probably.....seen it happen with smallies before, followed the surface activity around and best 1 hr fishing of my life  also possible is some sort of hatch rising to the surface and perch busting on it...happen to see any insect activity buzzing around?"
499158,bassmaster4,2010-08-27 20:56:00,801,"Could have been a Greenland Shark, i think theyre in the st. lawrence"
499170,2kj,2010-08-27 21:56:00,77,I know those are around Nova Scotia waters so that would be a long way up the river for that beast.  I'm thinking Musky or Sturgeon.  Any rumors of St Lawrence monters in its waters?
499176,cynmar,2010-08-27 22:19:00,169,"There are Beluga whales in the St Lawrence, immature ones are still a greyish colour. Possible?  Bill"
499178,cranks bait,2010-08-27 22:33:00,721,I know there is Sturgen down my way here on the Larry.  Only time I have experience my graph do that was right under the 1000 Islands bridge where there is a huge under water water fall.  Just the water turbulance was enough to mess it up.
499195,mercman,2010-08-28 00:13:00,7054," matter of fact yes, there seemed to be tons of little knat like flies landing or taking off the surface of the water.humm"

499199,mercman,2010-08-28 00:21:00,7054," a fisherman apparently caught a blue shark just past quebec city, but that far east the salt and fresh water start to mix,but not here in montreal though."
499200,spincast,2010-08-28 00:26:00,3279,definitely a US submarine patrolling for terrorists - or tobacco smugglers....

499208,ttreacy,2010-08-28 00:44:00,19,Cool thing to have happen...did you have any luck fishing that spot?
499228,Tdel,2010-08-28 01:10:00,393," Greenland sharks have been found in the St Lawrence River, near Baie-Comeau,Quebec. There was a documentary I believe on the Discovery Channel about Greenland sharks in the St. Lawrence. Research was done by Chris Harvey-Clark in 2003. Apparently they tagged some sharks and found that some males would travel up towards Quebec City and the females would stay in deeper water.  In the Saguenay fjord in 2006 a woman caught a Greenland shark while ice fishing.  Tom."
499231,mercman,2010-08-28 01:18:00,7054," not today, but most of the fish i posted the other day came from this same place. walleys, sheepshead and a nice pike. it was almost fishless this morning. weird...."
