498092,rbaquial,2010-08-25 02:38:00,968,"So, a buddy of mine has taken me to this place about twice now. I've caught on average (with my Ultra-Lights) 6inch bass, 4-5inch sunfish, the odd perch (5inches) and crappie (largest 9inches) all (at what I thought was the average) fish caught out of the lake, hence why I bought only my Ultra-Lights.  Buddy, rigs up with a WHOLE worm under a float. And I'm thinking... Nah, its not possible he can get some nice sized fish outta here. I mean, I know they stock once a year... but I don't think its possible. Anyway, to make a long story short - he does his lil dance, and gets tangled often enough to annoy the avg. fisherman... And what do I say to him.... ""You know what that means?"".. he replies ""What?"".... I say ""Your gotta catch a big one, watch!"".... Well, wouldn't you know it... there ARE SOME BIG BASS outta this little pond!  Enjoy the fish Pr0n!  1st Bass caught..(2 pics) [Pic 1 of 2]   [Pic 2 of 2]   2nd Bass caught... [Pic 1 of 2]   [Pic 2 of 2]     .... Here are my DINKIES!! Fish 1 of 2   ...My ""Biggest"" of the day!    We're hittin' up this place again on SUNDAY. This time, I'm coming PREPARED! .....""To be Continued....""...."

498213,BillsTheBassMan,2010-08-25 14:38:00,932,"Nice report man - looks like a quality day of bass fishing!  What kind of ultra-lite are you using?  Mine is a 5'6"" St. Croix and those first couple bass would be a real riot on the UL.  Thanks for sharing - looks like a decent day at what I'm assuming is a relatively urban pond.  Ryan"
