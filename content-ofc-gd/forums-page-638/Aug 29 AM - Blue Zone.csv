Again mixed bite spoons and flies dipsy and riggers...One King only, bunch of bows and few cohos....very poor catch ratio though[] My neighbor was getting enrolled into the Guinness book for the most fish lost in a day[][] Ended up 12 for 25....let some bigger once go and kept few smaller....still had tons of fun though...thanks for the company George Next trip - Port Burwell for the long weekend....hope the eyes are still around...  Few shots from the day:              Cheers, Ice Fisherman"

Emil.It almost turned out to be the best day ever when we saw the suv of our Lord and Savior,turned out it was his brother wayne.Oh well,can't have it all,nor can you catch 'em all!!!"
