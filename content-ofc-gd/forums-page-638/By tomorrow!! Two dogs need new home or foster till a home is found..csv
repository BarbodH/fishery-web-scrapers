They are both 8 yrs old (brother and sister) and have been together their whole lives so obviously the attachment is strong. I am waiting contact info and this is what I was sent about the dogs and their predicament. "

499298,BillsTheBassMan,2010-08-28 12:32:00,932,"I can see what I can do, but 1 day notice makes it dang near impossible.  I'm in a rural area and know a lot of people with farms.  That could be a suitable foster (unless they have the husky trait to run).  I agree that they cant be split up, I've seen dogs die immediately after their ""buddy"" dies on more than one occasion.  That's a bond you can't mess with.  Regardless. keep me updated.  I probably won't be able to string anything together by tomorrow, but if you found an interim person, I might be able to help after.  Best of Luck, Ryan"

499363,Gerritt,2010-08-28 20:02:00,6129,"I would be willing, on a foster type basis, and I would expect the owner to find a permanent home.... however Sunday is not doable... should a permanent owner not  be found I will return the dogs back to the owner after one month. I/we are located in Hamilton. the owness is on the dogs owner to find them suitable accommodation, i can help out for a bit... but will not assume permanent possession of the dogs.  G"
