The plan is that my cousin, his chum, and myself are going to portage out from there camp to a lake about 6km away. Friday night we load the 4 wheeler with canoes and gear and had some daddy pops by the fire.  Now I'm not much of a drinker anymore but one wobbly pop turned into a flurry of bud light and logs thrown on the fire.  Stories were told, a sauna and a swim, a few laughs (mostly at each others expense), and it was time to retire.  Fast forward to 7:07 Saturday morning.  I awake to an all too familiar yet long forgotten sensation of heartburn, headache, and garbage mouth.  Just as I roll my 6'3 body across a mattress the width of a tailgate, my cousin below bellows out a mournful sound from somewhere in his belly.  Slowly the septic tank odor diffused through the room until it finally reached my unsuspecting but sensitive sense of smell.  Suddenly I was in a panic because this ungodly smell had driven my hangover to the point of a ""technicolour yawn"".  I barely cleared the porch by the time it happened, definitely not my finest moment.  Two paddles and 3 portages later and we were on the windswept lake. We set up camp on the rocky point, then set out immediately on the lake to fish.  My cousin and his chum boarded a 14 ft fiberglass square stern and i set out in my kevlar.  While the 2 of them caught some decent little lakers in 25-30fow, I fished a lesser windy shoreline to no avail.  Dinner time rolled around and my hangover had only been fueled by the grueling paddle in the wind.  I was dehydrated, undernourished, and all around uncomfortable.  I suddenly found myself craving the groove in my couch and the therapeutic value of Gatorade.  I quickly ate pasta, loaded my pack, and proceeded to do the entire 3 hour portage in an hour and a half just to get back to the camp and head home.  It was a rough day but after the fact it was all kind of funny!  "
