499247,Cudz,2010-08-28 02:32:00,2652,I asked a friend of mineif he wanted to get out for 2 hours after he got off work (obviously not after I got off work lol). He said that would be cool.  We got out just after 6 and found some small fish early.  We changed things up and moved spots and did pretty well after that.  It was an absolutely perfect night as far as the weather is concerned.  Man I love living in Barrie. Here are some pics.  My fish was 3.9 pounds.  I thought it was a legit 4 pounder but the scale said otherwise.  Strong fish none the less.  
499268,fishinguypat,2010-08-28 03:29:00,547,Nice!

499271,Cudz,2010-08-28 03:44:00,2652,"Man, you know what?  I was thinking who could I ask to come fishing with me tonight if Rick did not want to come and I was thinking who I would ask on the forum that lives here and I totally forgot about you Rob.  Sorry bro, in the future if I have an opening in my boat I will send you a pm."

499349,The Urban Fisherman,2010-08-28 16:47:00,2050,Nice Smalljaw's dude!    What kind of scale are you usin Cudz?
499366,ckrb2007,2010-08-28 20:03:00,449, I was wondering the same thing........those look a heck of a lot bigger then 3-4lbs.
499388,Leecher,2010-08-28 23:11:00,7832, Same thing came to my mind when I saw the pics..... those seemed a lot bigger.... more like 4 - 4.5Lbs range     but that's just me Sounds like a good time Leechman
499421,tilly,2010-08-29 01:08:00,32,"Nice!  I should start fishing for bass, with my lanky arms those fish would be twice the weight!"
499422,Cudz,2010-08-29 01:11:00,2652,Rapala digital.  You can see it in my hand in the pic if you maximize it.
499437,SRT8 smoker craft,2010-08-29 02:45:00,1107,The rapala scales are usually not real accurate but seem to be close I'd say yours is weighing a bit light nice smallies.
499451,Cudz,2010-08-29 05:09:00,2652,I caught a smallie in a tourney last year and it weighed 1.9 on my scale.  I had to weigh it in and on the tourney scale it weighed 2.1 .  2 tenths is not too much but who knows.
499503,BillM,2010-08-29 14:42:00,17367,"Chris, next time you need someone to fish with little notice, let me know"
499539,Cudz,2010-08-29 17:01:00,2652,"If my buddy said no, you were my go-to guy. I was going to pm you. Plus I think my boat is staying in your neighbourhood right now while we are having construction at my house."
499567,EC1,2010-08-29 19:28:00,930,Nice fish there! They're getting fat and it's not even fall yet!
499568,Pigeontroller,2010-08-29 19:39:00,2793,Best time to be on the water!
