499607,Andy,2010-08-29 22:30:00,330,"  I've been using a version of that knot for years. I make 5 wraps down to the hook/lure, then up thru the top loop without going between the lines near the lure at the end of the wraps. Super quick and very strong. I use the super Uni for braid. Andy"
499608,CLofchik,2010-08-29 22:37:00,854,"Uni > Jam Knot  If you clip the tag end too close it will work loose out of the top loop because there's zero pressure on it, sending your beloved prize lure flying off to the horizon or prematurely releasing a prized fish with a hardware jaw tag.  3 guesses on how I figured that out?"
499740,Bernie66,2010-08-30 02:10:00,123,Just started using that knot recently.  I like it.  Also started using the albright to connect my braid to the fluoro leader this summer instead of the uni-uni.  Landed a 39inch chinny lastweek with those knots combination without any problems.
499818,PainInTheBass,2010-08-30 14:07:00,102,I recently started using that knot for my fluorocarbon leaders.  I love that knot.  It is strong and easy to tie.
