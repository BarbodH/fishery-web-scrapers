496867,scugpg,2010-08-21 22:36:00,1373,Guys I'm looking to book a reasonable cottage for a couple days in the fall and was wondering if you have any ideas. Prefer 30mins from Lindsay/Peterborough area.  Would like to get into walleye and bass/muskie would be a bonus. Stoney lake or Pigeon comes to mind. Even a smaller lake would work for us.  If you have any recommendations let me know or shoot me a PM if you feel more comfortable that route.  We would have our own boat as well.

Unfortunately I don't know anything about the resorts as I was at each just for the day.We actually had an OFC g2g at Buckhorn a number of years ago"
496966,wormdunker,2010-08-22 11:43:00,1711,"Lower Buckhorn Lake is a good lake for walleye, bass & musky.  We usually stay at 3 Castles.  Nice cottages, friendly, helpful owners.  They're located right by the dam in the town of Buckhorn.  They have a registry of past customers - my parents name is in it from 1955!!"

I believe there is only one resort on Jack Lake, but a lot of private cottages can be rented.  Since you own a boat, if it were me I would be going the private cottage route (search the net there are a lot of sites for this).  For me, my fall trip is usually French River (just throwing that out there)."
497463,jediangler,2010-08-23 19:45:00,1923,My choice would be Camp Ashtabula on Pigeon lake. Rob & Donna are great hosts.  http://www.campashtabula.com/contact.shtml  It's just north of Gannon's Narrows so a trip into Buckhorn is very handy as well.
