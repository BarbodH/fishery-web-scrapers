Threw some glow spoons, Cleos & others. Nothing happening.  Can't imagine the dredging right off the end of the pier, (maybe 200 yards?) is going to help.  Do you think the noise & all the stirred up sediment will kill any opportunity while it's going on? It's not like you can play from the other pier while it's going on either!"
499370,Pigeontroller,2010-08-28 20:25:00,2793,The Bronte Pier would be a better choice!
499378,I'mHooked,2010-08-28 21:49:00,525," I know it would, It's just with a 2 hour time frame and living 10 minutes from the lift bridge made it the choice last night. If the dredging is going to upset the apple cart for anything from Burlington, Bronte will just have to be the choice"
499583,Guest JPCT,2010-08-29 20:58:00,0,Bronte pier is like a 5 minute drive down Lakeshore.. shoulda went there  I've already written off the hamilton harbour pier for this year.
499586,bigugli,2010-08-29 21:12:00,6138,Dredging  is supposed to run to December. it will mess things up a little.

If you've got a small boat or something like a canoe they'll still probably be a few good days casting the beach with an empty pier.  With crystal clear water that is extra low this year, Bronte will be either on or off.  Burlington gets less fish, but atleast there's always some holding close."
