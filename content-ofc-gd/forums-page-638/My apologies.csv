499805,chessy,2010-08-30 13:13:00,610,so that is the reason my post was deleted ... i have american friends and they are better than some canadaians....
499829,Garnet,2010-08-30 15:16:00,2056,Don't really see how being a jerk relates to fishermen.  The news media does this all the time GM worked caught doing bla bla bla. South Simcoe farmer doing bla bla bla.  Fred who is a bit of a jerk proved it when boy fell on hood of car. That he was fishing means nothing.
499874,aplumma,2010-08-30 17:55:00,6896,As to you my new friend I apologize for judging you a Racist (used incorrectly by the way) before taking the time to really talk to you as we have done in p.m.'s. A Pepsi Sugar free and a hearty handshake is waiting for you at Lak Air if you get up their for the G2G. If you also get a chance to come to the Washington D.C. area we can fish for the monstrous Potomac River Carp or I can turn you into a Blue Catfish fan which ever you prefer.   Art
