81911,mason05,2007-06-10 13:19:00,258,"Went out this morning bright and early to my local pike hole.  It was a nice cool crisp morning and I was hoping not to get skunked two mornings in a row.  Saw a couple pike jumping just off the south shoreline and started casting in that direction.  I washed a few xraps and spinners for a half hour and decided to take a break and snap a quick shot of the shoreline.    Glad I took my break because after switching up to a little cleo I got this little scrapper on my second cast.    Continued to work the little cleo and minutes later I hooked into this guy.  Better fish than my first.  Approximately 24"".    I stayed out for another hour or so but the sun was starting to hit the water hard.  The bite turned off and I decided to call it a day.  It was fun getting into a few and I enjoyed the nice morning.  Corn Nug"
81912,ccmtcanada,2007-06-10 13:20:00,7971,Taking a break sometimes can make a world of difference!  Congrats on the two fish...they are pretty good sized pike.  Great shot of the shoreline too.  It's still early...why are you not still fishing?? LOL

82667,mason05,2007-06-12 01:55:00,258,"CCMT - I remember reading a post of yours recently where you stated that you took a quick break to enjoy the view and moments later you or Bly hooked a fish.  Sometimes you need to step back and survey the area before blindly tossing your lures out.  JB/GROG - My buds and I have got into pike in that area before using the good old wee cleo, in particular the blue/silver pattern.  Floating shiners and large suckers has also been productive.
