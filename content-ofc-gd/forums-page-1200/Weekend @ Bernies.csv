82604,Bly,2007-06-11 22:49:00,1556,Wow! What an awesome way to spend a weekend!  Thanks for taking the time to upload all of the pictures and share with us!!!
82605,Bernie,2007-06-11 22:50:00,3190,"""Thanks again Bernie couldn't have asked for a better guy to put up with us...""   Put up with you?  Was not an issue at all with you fellas. Im just glad you had fun and were patient with me to find the fish-even if I needed a little assistance from my brother Mike. We have been trying to get Mike to join the board soon too. Now I can tell you all he is an avid fisherman!!!  Thank you Bill, Corey and Gerritt for your kind words. But I enjoyed your company too, so thank you for that as well.  BTW Corey, are your arms sore from hauling in that monster sheephead? lol"
82646,Corey,2007-06-12 01:05:00,355,"The arms are more sore from the sunburn than that stinkhead! I think Gerritt has found a new drink of choice... well, maybe not more choice than his beer, but he's hooked on the mighty black russians.  Here's some more pics of Bernie fixing Gerritt's boat motor...      Here's Bernie's engine testing tank, making sure Gerritt isn't going to be paddling the west arm of Nipissing.    Anyone want to wager a guess what these are?   Here's some pics from the famous cedar strip boat building operation that has been mentioned previously. Fantastic quality and 100% hand crafted. Amazingly unbelievably beautiful boats!          "
82663,Daplumma,2007-06-12 01:47:00,1961,No worries Bernie..Took my brother a while to join also. Joe
82701,Mike the Pike,2007-06-12 02:50:00,3421,Now that was a plentyful amazing report .Good food Great host(And Yes Bernie is a true Gentleman).The boat tour is breathtaking.  Good on you Bernie taking the young Lads fishing.Who is the Skinniest kid in the picture of 4amigos?Oh ya thats Bill  MTP
82742,Gerritt,2007-06-12 10:14:00,6129,"MTP, Give Bill time... he is coming along nicely... he is just a boy after all! LOL  Gerritt."
82270,Gerritt,2007-06-11 11:49:00,6129,"Our day started off with Corey and Bill picking me up at work and heading off to Bernies! Just so everyone knows Bernie is one Class act, I would be hard pressed to find a friendlier person anywhere. He was certainly a great host and I am honored to call him a friend.  You will see a couple posts with pics as I was unable to take all of them so Corey will contribute as well.  I have never fished the South Shores of Lake Nipissing before... and it is COMPLETELY different fishing compared to the methods I was used too on the West Arm.  anyways enough blabber onto the pictures!   This is what greeted us as we made our way up the 400... To my surprise the traffic was pretty good! Made for decent driving once the storm passed...but MAN was there ALOT of rain and lightening!          Bill.... going with the flow...    Ahhhh.... were here...    It did not take long to get our lines wet...    Ahhhhh.....    Cheese!    Our first catch    Bill with his entry..    and Corey with his...    Bernie getting r'done!    Bill enjoying the weather    Man can Bernies boat haul carp!      A lazy couple hours on the ""Barge         And here is the mascot... Hobbs!!    "
82272,Corey,2007-06-11 11:53:00,355,"Wow! I don't know what more I can say about this weekend. I don't know how I can possibly thank Bernie enough for being such a great host. This weekend had everything that any of us could ever want. It started with pretty good traffic, even though we drove through a tornado. We found Bernie's place in no time, got packed into the boat and then scooted over to the cottage. We have lots of laughs, lots of fish and all came home with amazing memories.  Bernie and his brother Mike are both amazing fishermen. Not only do they know the area very well, we caught fish at pretty much every hole we pulled up to. It was a hard bite, but we did manage to tempt the hungry ones at every place we stopped in to fish.  Bernie pretty much hand feeds some of the woodpeckers up there, pretty cool to see them from 4 feet away.     Bernie has the cutest dog for sure, very well behaved and we spoiled him with lots of yummie meat all weekend.   While we were going for a rip out to a fishing hole...  We saw a pretty neat rainbow by itself up high in the clouds.   Some of these pics that Bernie posted are the same as the ones below, but you can't imagine what kind of a surf and turf meal we had Saturday night!           Here's a pic of Bernie after a long hard day of fishing, living the life we all wish we had.   I will post more fishing pics a little bit later.  cd."
82282,Bernie,2007-06-11 12:19:00,3190,"What a great weekend we had! Weather was perfect,winds were light and the fishing was ok. But the best part was we had a lot of fun. Good times were had by all. Great to meet Gerritt,Corey and Bill,all super guys. We are definitely going to do it again!"
82289,Gerritt,2007-06-11 12:33:00,6129,"some of the scenery...            Here is a disemboweled Gull *Yuck*     There were lots of these fish.... All fish in the slot went back      Sunday was a great day to be on the water! the fishing picked up and this is what we caught in a few hours on the water... there were alot of fish in the slot caught as well....      The Boys      Bernie and his brother Mike... two awesome guys!    I know Corey has a crapload of pictures to add to this report as well.  If you are ever invited to join Bernie for a day of fishing jump at the chance! Great people, Great times and good clean fun!  Hope everyone enjoyed their weekend!  Gerritt."
82304,snag,2007-06-11 13:18:00,1932,That was great.  Love to get up there this year.  What lure/bait was working?
82307,Gerritt,2007-06-11 13:22:00,6129,Ahhhhh.... thats a secret I promised to take to my grave! just ask Mike LOL....  it is Bernie Custom! Bernie makes an awesome jig!  Gerritt.

82347,Bernie,2007-06-11 15:18:00,3190,Gerritt cooking up a meal fit for hungry fishermen.  Bill doing another fine job on the fish frying.  The weather was great compared to last week.  Gotta love those bent fishing rods.

82411,Joey,2007-06-11 17:00:00,9122,What a great report Gerritt.  Nice mess of fish and looks like you all ate well and had a good time.  That barge looks like a huge floating pool table  Joey
