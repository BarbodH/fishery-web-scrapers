Started out Sunday from 12:30 - 3:30 PM.  landed a number of smallies, some in the 4-5 lbs class, (2) walleyes and sheephead.  Was drifting a green and gold fleck power tube with an insert rattle.  Was able to get out again last night since the wife had to catch up on some work, fished from 5:30-8:30.  Using the same program as the day before caught more smallies, smaller in size than the previous day, and sheephead.  Was marking a good number of fish on the deeper edge, assuming they were eyes, but could not get them to bite.  Maybe next time.  Sorry no pictures, I am terrible when it comes to bringing a camera.  Good Fishing, Tom"
