81744,steverowbotham,2007-06-09 21:05:00,1800,"Well last night I posted about fishing for brook trout in Barrie, no one responded, since I rarely fish for trout, and definitely never around here, I was on my own.  I started driving and stopped at a nice looking creek ... drift, drift, drift nothing.  Headed to a new spot drift, drift, FISH! then a few more drifts and a fish.  Caught 12 in 45 minutes and went home.  I kept 5 for the pan because my desire to fish for brookies was fueled by my desire to eat some as I never got out for opener this year.  I kept one duker 14 incher because it wouldnt stop bleeding, nothing compared to the 16 incher I landed right after her!  the 16er was released.  I'll come back on later and let you all know how they taste  "
81745,fishergirl72,2007-06-09 21:07:00,455,You got yourself some real nice ones Steve!

81749,steverowbotham,2007-06-09 21:12:00,1800,"haha you bet, no more driving 2 hours for opener, I'm staying here haha."
81751,b2kptbo,2007-06-09 21:42:00,1505,"Good hunting, nice catch..."
81752,Spiel,2007-06-09 21:48:00,9065,"....Those are some real dandies for anywhere in the province. Reminds me very much of the ones I stalk close to home here in Hamilton. Well done, enjoy your meal."
81757,misfish,2007-06-09 22:28:00,29133,"Seen yer post Steve way to late to respond. Lots of good waters with in 15-20 minutes in and around Barrie to fish them.  Nice catch ,enjoy."
81759,mason05,2007-06-09 22:37:00,258,Very nice looking specks man!  If I had to guess I'd say the fish at the top was the last one caught.  It still has some nice colour to it.  Not for long though.  Enjoy your dinner!  Corn Nug
81760,steverowbotham,2007-06-09 22:44:00,1800,"last one was caught last ... my post is wrong, but I'm too lazy to edit it ... caught them in 1hr 45 mins .... not 45 mins.  first 4 I got quickly .... then I released a bunch of 10-11 inchers before calling it quits and keeping that smaller one...  Brian, if you still have any info to share, I'll gladly take it."
81763,fishersquige,2007-06-09 23:12:00,52,Nice Stevo!!!!!!!!!
81768,fishindevil,2007-06-09 23:32:00,6254,"WOW.  ...they are great size brookies thats for sure,way to go man!!!!!!! cheers"
81801,Bly,2007-06-10 01:27:00,1556,Nice when you find a spot that produces so close to home!   Nice trout!
81818,steverowbotham,2007-06-10 02:14:00,1800,"Thanks guys... and girls.. It was fun, and a learning experience.  Squuege, we gotta tell Rossi on monday, he doesnt think I can catch trout lol, cause Im a bass fisherman ... haha gotta remember that bass is closed for more than half of the year, gotta fill my time somehow.  P.S.  I pan fried the fish in a basic flour/pepper/garlic salt seasoning ..... delish !!!"
82028,Carmen,2007-06-10 19:10:00,72,"I've done a lot of spec fishing in the past 30 odd years everywhere from Algonquin to James B watershed to L Huron tributaries and I have to say those are some of the nicest Brookies within 20 min of Barrie that I've ever seen. I'm lucky enough to have a few honey holes within 5 min (less than 10 km) from my place in Caledon but the odd 12 incher is a rare bonus. Great work, enjoy"
82031,misfish,2007-06-10 19:37:00,29133, Steve.lets get together in the fall before closing.
82108,camillj,2007-06-11 01:08:00,1988,Very nice !!! And so close to home ... jeeze I have to  travel about 12 hrs to get my specks
82119,steverowbotham,2007-06-11 01:39:00,1800,"Brian, just let me know brother .... we'll chat at Bassmania."
82136,steverowbotham,2007-06-11 02:01:00,1800,  Just figured you should have a look at the deliciousness I enjoyed last evening along with some fried garlic potatoes..... mmmmmm
82157,ccmtcanada,2007-06-11 02:43:00,7971,WOW!! Nice sizes there!  I seem to only catch 5 to 6 ones in the tribs this time of year.  Congrats on a great day out there....and btw...that dinner looks great!
82215,Stern Rules,2007-06-11 06:34:00,342,"Steve, what were you using when you were drifting for the brookies? I've only used worn and no floats. How do you fish 'em? I would have definately gone out for those."
82216,Stern Rules,2007-06-11 06:35:00,342,"Steve, what were you using when you were drifting for the brookies? I've only used worm and no floats. How do you fish 'em? I would have definately gone out for those."
82236,solopaddler,2007-06-11 10:13:00,8605,Nice Steve! For someone who says he's not a trout fisherman you seem to have a knack  .
82610,steverowbotham,2007-06-11 23:03:00,1800,"well, it rained Friday night, and I spent 15 minutes or so outside with a flashlight around 11pm, to find my bait.... theres a hint and a half haha.  No floats.  Solo,  That was my first trip out for them in years, first ever in this region.  I lucked out and found some good holes.... tell me to catch a steelie and see what happens  Still, gotta get out this fall  Take care."
