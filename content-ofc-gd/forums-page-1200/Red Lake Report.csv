Also the high water caused a lot of floating wood so be on the look out. Dispite the high water and wet weather the fishing was good with a lot of slot fish being caught. Walleyes went on jigs,spinners and crawlers in twelve foot of water. Northerns were slow with the best luck on soft baits fished very slowly."
