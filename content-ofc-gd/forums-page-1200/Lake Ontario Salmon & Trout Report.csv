82140,RobHall,2007-06-11 02:05:00,261,"Excellent report and love the pics.      Thanks for sharing.  Keep those inches coming.  Quick question...How many inches are you claiming for the salmon and how many inches are you claiming for the trout?  I will add them to the board under Team 3 ""Fin-Chasers"".  Thanks  FOTB "

82225,SlowPoke,2007-06-11 08:35:00,2984,"Nice job out there! Those sonar shots convinced me to install my 50/200 transducer. I keep hearing ""lack of detail"" on 50 kHz but yours is finding baitfish and t-clines just fine. Do you find the cone angle on the 200 kHz too narrow? -Brian"
