Unfortunately all the pics I tried to take of the mooneyes didn't come out well - need some polarized lenses for the camera but I had to mention these fish  (at least according to to the locals they were mooneyes - new fish to me, kinda cool).  They were in full 'getting it on' mode with 1 fish (I'm going out on a limb and assuming the female) being chased in circles by 3-5 others.  Saw that activity at a couple different spots.  Also saw a ferret that cost me a lure + leader.  The little guy came hopping towards me and froze when he saw me and even stayed put as I grabbed the camera but then ducked just as I snapped it - all I got was a picture of a rock pile and a snagged mepps for my trouble.  Ah well, was kinda neat seeing him hopping along.  Anyhow, not much of a report for this weekends fishing but with weather like we had who's to complain and the locals didn't seem to be doing too much better so I don't feel too bad (even if I did have to sacrifice a mepps to the fishing gods)."

82718,tbayboy,2007-06-12 03:24:00,1497,"Its the photo stitch feature on my Canon  - it shows the previous pic so its kinda easy to line up the next then they have a bit of software that 'smart' matches them all into one pic and it actually does a pretty good job for free software (well free with the camera).  <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/emosworld/202111855/"" title=""Photo Sharing""><img src=""http://farm1.static.flickr.com/58/202111855_bb2887c70c_b.jpg"" width=""1024"" height=""182"" alt=""sunset stitch"" /></a>  <a href=""   title=""Photo Sharing""><img src=""http://farm1.static.flickr.com/68/202102373_5716fd5993_b.jpg"" width=""1024"" height=""182"" alt=""diamond head stitch"" /></a>  At least it works a lot better then windows movie maker does - stupid thing hung after lining up all the video clips I took this weekend, sigh.  Guess the video has to wait til I finish kicking myself for not saving my work in progress.  Update: managed to get a quick version of the video done before it crashed again, nothing exciting - no actual fish caught on video (if video isn't working try again later, youtube is still 'processing' it):  <object width=""425"" height=""350""><param name=""movie"" value=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8V_eGIl62w""></param><embed'>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8V_eGIl62w""></param><embed src=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8V_eGIl62w"" type=""application/x-shockwave-flash"" width=""425"" height=""350""></embed></object>"
