82429,nautifish,2007-06-11 17:42:00,1416,what type of bird this is? Was thinking maybe a woodpecker?  But it was feeding from the ground in my back garden...Allmost looked like it was digging for insects or worms.  1st time seeing  one in my back garden.            Nauti.
82434,Mattitude,2007-06-11 17:51:00,155,"It's a Northern Flicker.  A few different variations Yellow Shafted, Red Shafted.  It is a member of the Woodpecker family.  They used to fly into my windows all the time."
82437,nautifish,2007-06-11 17:57:00,1416,  I am looking on the net matt to see what i can find but the pictures i see of the flickers do not look like identical to  this one. This bird did not have the red or yellow tash......It does how ever have a very distinct red allmost crest on the back of the head/ I was not fast enough with the cam though when it raised the red feather on the back of the head.........
82441,misfish,2007-06-11 18:00:00,29133,Cool red marking at the back of the head. I have no idea what it is Naut. Sorry.
82444,Roy,2007-06-11 18:03:00,13728,It is a Northern flicker. Matt is 100% correct.  Edit: That's the yellow shafted because it has the red marking at the back of the head. The red shafteds have the red marking on their face. (Cheeks)
82447,Mattitude,2007-06-11 18:07:00,155,"Sorry I forgot to say that the shafts Yellow or Red are underneath the wings, if I remember correctly."
82448,nautifish,2007-06-11 18:07:00,1416,  I love birds missfish  i allways get excited when i see a new kind of bird feeding in my back garden.....lol....It does look like some type of flicker and from what i have red they are ground feeders mostly ants. Apparently they are the ant eaters of the bird world.....But i do not see any with the red crest.........Which is sat at the back of the head and not on top of the head.  Hopefully this picture is a little better.  
82460,Guest lundboy,2007-06-11 18:30:00,0, From what I can see on this site: http://animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu/site...e.jpg/view.html  It's a Northern Flicker.
82461,Mattitude,2007-06-11 18:33:00,155,It's a marking (red crescent) nothing unusual.  They ate ants at my place too.
