My buddy was onto a silver with his first cast! Over the course of the next four hours we caught numerous silvers and quite a few pesky OOS smallmouth (yes they were quickly released). In fact my buddy kept a even three dozen silvers for the dinner table. It didn't seem to matter what we threw they were all over it. I'm thinking I need to get the kids out there on the weekend as I'm sure they'll have no trouble connecting. The action was so fast I'm sorry to say I didn't snap a single picture but I know you'll beleive me inspite of any previous angling failures....LOL  So if you like fast action fishing and a few silvers for the dinner table I'd suggest you head to your favourite Erie haunts as they seemed to be everywhere. Good Luck."
