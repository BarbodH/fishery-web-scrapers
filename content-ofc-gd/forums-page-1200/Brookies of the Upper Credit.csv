Plenty of fish, most of them small, but very active. I got a hit pretty much on every cast.  Landed about 6, lost almost 10. All of them released to fight another day.  It is said that a picture is worth a thousand words. These pictures were worth a thousand mosquito bites and zero regrets.        "

82207,lunkerbasshunter,2007-06-11 04:48:00,2585,nice day you had there.  love the area!  Cheers!
82311,MJL,2007-06-11 13:36:00,2427,WOW!  Those things are just gorgeous.  Looks like you had a great day out.  I don't fish for resident trout but it definitely looks like something I want to get into.  WTG
82374,ehg,2007-06-11 15:52:00,2666,"Great report! There is even resident browns, odd small rainbow and Atlantic salmon up there. I pretty well put the muskies and bass away to do that type of fishing last year.\  The headwaters of the Saugeen and Grand a bit to the northwest produce same fish as well, but check your regs, for hook type and catch and release conditions.  Thanks for posting,  ehg"
