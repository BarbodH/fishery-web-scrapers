I have a 2002 176 Prince Craft, the issue I have is main cranking battery terminals have poor contact due to heavy oxidiation on the Red motor wire.  At times I have to use a wire brush to get the green crud off the terminal.  The differance between the red and black terminals is the black seems to be steel or aluminum and the red is copper.  Any words of advise would be welcome.  Thanks  Ken"

Look at the wiring also above the connection to make sure that is okay also.  Change it over to a similar connector as the ground possibly a different size so it is easily noticeable.  Also if you need to change or mend the wiring make sure you use the appropriate gauge wire, should be 6 gauge but check.  Tape up the new conection and clean off battery and you should be ready to go."
