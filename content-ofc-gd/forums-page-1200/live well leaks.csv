82536,aniceguy,2007-06-11 20:34:00,1094,"is the livewell a rotationally molded plastic, an aluminum or plastic lined one?"
82537,misfish,2007-06-11 20:34:00,29133,"Check the areas where the water is released also all the clamps at the pumps and hoses.Is it a full one piece tank or are the ports connectors.Maybe the seals are not tight enough.Also make sure it,s the right plug. I dought it,s cracked but I could be wrong,has happen.LOL  As for the truck stuff,Thats not going to seal it,if it is cracked,it will still seperate from the pounding when full. IMO"
