82802,Flappn,2007-06-12 14:21:00,245,I have a Trailer in a park however it is your standard trailer..nothing built up around it. Insurance seems to be resonable..I believe we pay $20 a month. Don't know what to recommend in your situation.
82804,Terry,2007-06-12 14:28:00,14456,"well, take some pictures of it set a value on it walking your favourite insurance company and ask them for a price on whatever they wish to call it  pay  enjoy trailer/whatever"
