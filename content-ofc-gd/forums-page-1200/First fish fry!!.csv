82585,Guest Johnny Bass,2007-06-11 22:05:00,0,I finally had my first fish fry of the season and It was amazing!!!You guys have to try the New Fish Crisp. I think its called Roasted garlic butter??  I think I ate over 4lbs of fish easy. They were all Pickeral and I had one Jumbo perch I wanted to try. It was ok but didn't compare to the pickeral.  Here are some pictures. Unfortunately they are crappy.      I have a feeling that pickeral populations are going to start declining rapidly.lol  Which reminds me. I have a reel to pull apart and a rod to switch around.
