82302,Stoty,2007-06-11 13:14:00,2910,"Two of my buddies and I headed out to Rice Lake yesterday (Sunday) morning, with high hopes of getting a few nice walleyes..........  Those high hopes soon turned to desperation! We fished from 5:30 a.m - noon. Threw bucktails, crankbaits, jigs, worm harness'...YOU NAME IT....  Between the 3 of us we got 3 smallies, 2 rock bass, and a perch!  We got so desperate, we even resorted to trying to get some crappie.....(also to no avail)  Turns out, that was the day we had... very ""crappie""!  Got a nice tan though! lol   Hopefully Stoney is a little better this weekend."
82629,bbog,2007-06-11 23:51:00,665,"Hi Stoty,  Reading your story I don't feel so bad about my weekend. I had set out to find Crappie and couldn't keep the little Pike off. Imagine a 25"" Pike interested in a micro tube? Was fun though on ultralight gear. Changed the target to Pike and then got into a couple OOS Smallies and Largemouth. The ones you want never seem to be available when you want them.  At least we were out...  Barn"

82746,Blake,2007-06-12 11:00:00,418,Atleast you got out for the day.  Rice has been hit and miss for eyes and crappie so it must have been a miss day.  As you said atleast you got a nice tan. Good luck on the next outing.
82751,Steelcat,2007-06-12 11:21:00,191,The fish were off last weekend.  Must be the storm last friday that scared them away   I'm pretty sure they are back on this week
82770,Stoty,2007-06-12 12:55:00,2910,"Thanks for the good wishes! I will be on Stoney this week and next (for opening Bass). Hopefully mother nature will be nice to me!  I have seen people fishing for Muskie's on here, but doesn't musky open with Bass?"
82773,mart,2007-06-12 13:01:00,93,Musky's already open on the Kawarthas ( 1st Saturday in June). I'll be chasing them next week on Lwr. Buckhorn. Good luck on Stoney. Watch out for underwater ROCKS!!!!
