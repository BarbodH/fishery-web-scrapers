Marked pods of bait and some hooks but not much.  Ran 4 rods.  Had the 5 colour peel some line a few times but nothing hooked up.  Then the 10 colour goes, had weight and we saw it on the surface way back, then we lost it.  Finally a rod fires again and this time a get a nice Chinook in the boat.  Next up is Jamie.  The dipsey rod fires and Jamie lands one. Both fish came in 130 feet of water.     We trolled for another hour and headed back to 50.  Great night to be out and nice to get into some fish as well.....Kept both fish.  Jame kept the smaller one and I gave the other to my neighbor....    Sherriff"
