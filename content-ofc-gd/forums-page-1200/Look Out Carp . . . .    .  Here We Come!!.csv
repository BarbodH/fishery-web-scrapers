A couple hours later when Vic arrived, I was still waitng for my FIRST line bump . . .     but not even a twitch!! By about 09:00 there were 5 of us . . .     with one carp landed, and Vic & I each had a bit of a 'drive-by,' SOMETHING hesitatingly peeled a few inches of line out, then quit . . . .     a goby on steroids perhaps? Since this spot has an early morning bite (when there is a bite) I decided I'd head over to Etobicke Creek just after 10:00 . . . .    again . . .    only 2 fishing . . .    both regulars . . . .    who had seen no signs of (carp) life since daylight! By 2:30ish, I'd had enough . . . .     and skulked off home for some much needed sleep. I'm now off to the Kawarthas with Mr. Carper himself, (A K A Gregarious) who will likely give me some fishing tips!! After hitting the books for the last 8 months, I think he's ready to SWIM after any fish that even comes close!!"
