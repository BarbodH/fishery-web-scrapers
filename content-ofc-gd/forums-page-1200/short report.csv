82509,Bly,2007-06-11 19:59:00,1556,"Cliff and I have been asked recently if we ever get skunked.....  It was my turn to fish last night, was out from about 9pm until 11pm and nothing!  Had a few line bumps but no takers.  I did however see a very nice pike in the area.......pulled in the carp line, grabbed my other rod and made a few casts.  Didn't get to try for long...pike bolted and just as I was wondering where it went I saw another large dark profile in the water.....upon closer inspection.....I saw this.....        After that, I tried carping for a bit longer but nothing.....ah well..it happens!!"

82535,fishnsled,2007-06-11 20:32:00,3520,I was wondering what that smell was.   It was pretty bad.  LOL!  Better to be out and seeing what you saw then not getting out at all.  Still a good night out IMO.
82546,lunkerbasshunter,2007-06-11 20:58:00,2585,well it is better to get skunked then not get out at all.  Cheers!
82566,Bly,2007-06-11 21:30:00,1556,"Thanks Joey    Really I did! LOL    If it hadn't been swimming in that location, I might have considered it......then again, not sure it would have fit in my net, bigger than it looks in the picture.   A skunk like last night doesn't bother me.....I had spent the daytime with two 5 year olds.....I would have been happy to sit there last night even without fishing LOL"
