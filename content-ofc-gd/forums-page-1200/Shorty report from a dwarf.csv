Smallest was 26"" Took them all on a down deep husky jerk (blue and gold) 4'  behind a 2 ounce bottom bouncer. Surface temp was 61F. Was running 1.8 to 2.2 mph. upstream. Here's a pic of the one I brought home. (26"") "
81915,misfish,2007-06-10 13:32:00,29133,"Thats a great catch in a short time bud.And that smile.Between you and Lew,it,s a tough call to pick a winner.LOL  TFS fella."
81916,Beans,2007-06-10 13:33:00,3339,SMILE !!!...who do you think you are...LEW ???  Brian beat me...
81917,Guest Johnny Bass,2007-06-10 13:34:00,0,Roy. Whats with the Lew look? Didn't you know if you brought fish home you'd have to clean them??lol.  Great Report. Sounds like you know what you are doing!
81918,Guest Johnny Bass,2007-06-10 13:35:00,0,LOL. I guess we were all thinking the same thing!
81920,ccmtcanada,2007-06-10 13:37:00,7971,Good job Roy...I'm sure that one you brought home will be very happy there.  You have an aquarium big enough for him??? LOL  Lookin forward to seeing you up at Lakair....wow...just a few short weeks....
81923,solopaddler,2007-06-10 13:39:00,8605,"Smallest was 26""?, wow that's impressive. What was the biggest?"
81928,mason05,2007-06-10 13:41:00,258,Beauty pickerel you got there.  Congrats!
81930,Roy,2007-06-10 13:41:00,13728,"They seemed to be all the same size Mike but I think the largest was 32""."
81937,danc,2007-06-10 13:46:00,4677,Good job Roy.
81941,solopaddler,2007-06-10 13:50:00,8605," That's gotta be at least 10lb's maybe more, that's amazing!"
81945,TJQ,2007-06-10 13:53:00,7806,Thats great... someone will have to bring dinner to lakair...
81957,Daplumma,2007-06-10 14:07:00,1961,"Nice fish Roy,I have caught a couple of good sized Walleyes on the large deep down Husky but never thought about trolling one with a bottom bouncer. Joe"
81959,Roy,2007-06-10 14:12:00,13728,"They won't go down deep enough consistently Joe, so the bottom bouncer keeps the bait in the strike zone. I'm only trolling 50' or so behind the boat."
81963,Smokey,2007-06-10 14:21:00,1278,"Nice fish Roy, Congrats. Nice to see your getting out on the water and catching some nice fish. Thanks for the report."

81982,douG,2007-06-10 15:15:00,2693,"Attaboy, Roy.  Trolling walleye in the propwash again?"
81983,Deano,2007-06-10 15:15:00,767,"I have to admit also, first thing I thought when I saw the pic was, smile, you're not Lew. Great outing Roy, that would sure put a smile on my face."
81987,tjsa,2007-06-10 15:35:00,1578," SWEEEEEET!!!!!!!!  Thats one nice CUE for the time out, and size wise, awesome. Post some pics of the aftermath also will ya, ie: dinner."
82006,Bly,2007-06-10 17:11:00,1556,Nice Roy!   Still trying to find some in our area that are willing to bite.  Nice adaption of the bottom bounce....will have to remember that if I ever get a boat

82037,TennesseeGuy,2007-06-10 19:48:00,957,All those big fish in only two hours on the water?  Must belong to the fishermen's union.  Fish two hours and get paid a week of fish.
82038,ChrisK,2007-06-10 19:55:00,2772,Nice catch Roy....  As for your smile...... It must be cause Lakair is just a week and change away..If that don't make ya smile I don't know what will...
