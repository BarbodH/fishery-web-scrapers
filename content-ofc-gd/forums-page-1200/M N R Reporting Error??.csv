81520,Photoz,2007-06-08 23:02:00,792,"This has gotta be a first for MY books . . .    closed season in Ontario for perch??

He was previously convicted on July 17, 2006 in Alexandria Provincial Court for angling without a licence.  Anyone else aware of this law . . .     I don't have my old 2005/2006/2007 regs book any more?"
81530,Bly,2007-06-08 23:22:00,1556,Did a little reading and here is what I found.......  Lancaster and Charlottenburgh Townships and the City of Cornwall except for those waters of the St. Lawrence River (Lake St. Lawrence) west of the dam at the Robert H. Saunders Generating Station.  Yellow perch closed from April.1 - Fri. before 2nd Sat. in May.  Who knew??  bly
81534,Greencoachdog,2007-06-08 23:30:00,8163, Very good researching bly!!!... I'd also have to add that any lake that was closed completely would be included as well. Like the Kawarthas in winter...
81581,bucktail,2007-06-09 01:18:00,1857,"Wow thats a new one for me too! Think its time they simplified the laws, when expierenced anglers don't know you have a problem"
81584,ccmtcanada,2007-06-09 01:26:00,7971,"Jeez...can the wording be more complicated?  Cant fish 2 steps to the right of the bridge, UNLESS you wear size 13 shoe, on even numbered days in alternating months beginning in March of this year through to the last moon phase in November, except in a leap year.  See exceptions for leap year."
81635,wolfville,2007-06-09 04:26:00,396," LOL, Cliff, I think you are qualified to write the regs for MNR, you have the gift they've been looking for."
81649,pikehunter,2007-06-09 11:09:00,1659," I and many couldn't agree more!  Too many exceptions and tight little areas where the exceptions cover. Way too confusing. Just set one set of rules for each geographic area and be done with it. If the rules need to be tight then so be it. I'd rather it be easy to understand and less to read. So if a broader area must be included in more specific rules then just do so, the fish will probably be better off anyway.  Just make the whole damn reg book easier to understand, I don't need a brain hemorrhage   every time I open the cover!"
81650,Roy,2007-06-09 11:23:00,13728,The average age of fisherfolks in Cornwall is 38.5 years old.
81654,lunkerbasshunter,2007-06-09 12:33:00,2585,"i guess it goes ot show you, read the regs in every lake or river your not familar with.  it sure would suck to lose your license for perch fishing out of season."
81777,fishindevil,2007-06-09 23:51:00,6254,"Thats just another reason we have to read the fine print,its up to the anglers to know the laws ....you cant blame the old saying like oh i didnt know....thanks for getting us up to date on that....cheers"
81803,camillj,2007-06-10 01:32:00,1988,Thats ok ...when I got charged (about 15 years ago) and the regs were OPEN on my front seat to the correct page ... and I had read them less than an hour before... and I had just called the MNR office (less than 48 hrs previously) because I saw a bunch of fishermen there and thought it was a sanctuary ... who told me it was okay to fish where I was ... but failed to mention that it was going to become a sanctuary as of the second saturday in August... dont ask for coordinates because its a secret   Anyhow its getting too complicated even for me
82493,Patches,2007-06-11 19:40:00,48, I wonder if they took this bonehead's gear the first time as well.  And what does the Crown due with seized gear?
82497,tonyb,2007-06-11 19:50:00,1637,I was just thinking the same thing...anyone know?  Tony
82538,huntervasili,2007-06-11 20:36:00,1604,Quite sure alot of it gets donated to kids and tackle shares...
