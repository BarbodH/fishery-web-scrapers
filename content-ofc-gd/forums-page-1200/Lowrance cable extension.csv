I payed $30 for it, but it's free to a good home if you can use it.  If you want it, PM me your address and I'll mail it out to you.  It's 24"" long with 5 pins...male & female and the conections are blue  The part # is M-0036  It was for a black & white GPS/sonar combo but have no idea what other units it'll fit.    "
