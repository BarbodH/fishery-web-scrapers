81353,misfish,2007-06-08 17:44:00,29133,"I was just ther this weekend. Launch is first street to your right ,before the bridge in town. Follow the signs. Right by the high school.  Water was already in the low 70,s,Im sure it will be higher.  Watch your speed,they dont like wakes in the canals."
81507,lilkynan,2007-06-08 22:18:00,173,How has the Pike fishing been the past few years?
81509,misfish,2007-06-08 22:33:00,29133,"Well I cant speak for the last few years, but what I found last weekend,there are some real nice fish there,but the warm water has put a real hard on to find on them. Was told by a real vet of the area, we did well for a couple of newbies fishig the area,Pen,Fairy and Vernon. We did ok using nothing but artificial baits. Im sure my pop would of loved, TO USE A MINNA AND A OLD RED AND WHITE BOBBER.   But he did ok with the jerk baits.  http://www.ofncommunity.com/forums/index.php?showtopic=7822"
82367,lilkynan,2007-06-11 15:48:00,173,Was a great weekend - Sunshine - not too hot - kids had a great time at Hutchison Beach - and my little guy got about 20 blackfly bites!!!  Wow - has that town changed in 10 years - especially over HWY 60!! - Its almost a new town -  You were right misfish - the sign says 9 kph in the canals and the locals got upset about me doing that. But all in all - it was a  GREAT WEEKEND!!!!  Thanks for the info
