We tied on a pikeral rig casted it out and from thier on it was non stop perch action. Most of the ones we caught were on the 10-12 inch range. Perching slowed down as soon as the crowds gathered and started casting over our lines. My sister caught the biggest one at 13 inches, we also got a silver and a white perch. Next day we went again, it was a pretty slow day to say the least. We got a alot of small ones but I managed to get a 9 incher and a 13 incher, eneded up giving it to the people beside us. I didn't bring the camera with me the second time, sorry Team 3. Some pics..  First perch of the day for me   Our catch "
