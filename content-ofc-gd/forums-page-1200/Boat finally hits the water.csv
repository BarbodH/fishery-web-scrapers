82092,Fang,2007-06-11 00:37:00,1330,"After what seems like the worst start to the season for me in a long time, I finally had today free and started working on the boat. After lunch it was cleaned up and full of gas and off to Bronte I headed.  Pulled into the parking lot at 3 pm and hit a traffic jam. Parking lot full and 5 other boats waiting to launch. A quick turn around and down to 16 mile creek. No one there but a couple of jet skis and in 15 minutes was heading out to give the baot a good run. Burned through a 1/4 tank of gas to giove the motor some work and then set up in 150 FOW in front of Bronte.  Very cool water temp for June 56.5F on surface. Set 2 lines 1 at 30 and 1 at 50. Within 10 minutes had first hit. Small 3 lb bow. Picked up a couple more small guys and 1 more decent one.  36.25"" for Team 8. Took almost 20 minutes to get it in "
