82181,ccmtcanada,2007-06-11 03:52:00,7971,Yep...bullheads....you dont want to touch them if you dont have to....I usually take pliers or hemostats for the hook and hold the tail end of the body.  I've had them get me through gloves!

82184,jediangler,2007-06-11 03:53:00,1923,I've probably been injured more from landing small rockbass than all other species combined. When they are too small to lip those fins always seem to get me.
82467,Guest lundboy,2007-06-11 18:48:00,0,"Just about all fish have sharp spines in the fins not really razor like, so they don't really cut you just prick you. Sunfish, Rock Bass, Bluegill, LM Bass, SM Bass, Walleye, Pike, Musky and even Perch (both gill plate and dorsal fins on Perch).  Bullheads (the brownish catfish) have venomous spines in front of the dorsal and pectoral fins which can be quite painful if not handled carefully.  Walleye, Pike and Musky have sharp teeth that you have to be careful of when removing hooks. In the case of Pike/Musky the inside of the gill plates are extremely sharp (razor like) so they have to be handled carefully preferable as little as possible using a cradle or rubber net."
