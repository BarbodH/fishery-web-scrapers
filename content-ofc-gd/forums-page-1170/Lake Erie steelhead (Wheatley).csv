With just over 3 wks before the fish head back to Ohio and Pennsylvania waters the bite has been going strong. Today we battled with over 20 chromers in 4 hrs. I was fishing with my wife during the heat of the day 11:30 -3:30. The riggers were hot from 30 45 down and the best colors were, Oil Slick and Monkey Puke. Time is running out quick, seems like the summer just started and we are already into August. "
