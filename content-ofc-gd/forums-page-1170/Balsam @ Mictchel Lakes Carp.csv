100403,Terry,2007-08-03 00:12:00,14456,they reported it on the news that both lakes have a carp die off...they stated that 30 tons of fish had been dumped at local landfills  but I can't believe it is anywhere near that much....in to weeks I would think it will hit simcoe
100415,lazybum,2007-08-03 00:59:00,142,"If 3,300 fish died and the average weight of each is 20 lbs then you get 66,000 lbs or approx. 30 metric tonnes."
