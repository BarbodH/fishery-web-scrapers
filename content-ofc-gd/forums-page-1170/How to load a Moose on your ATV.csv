99888,TJQ,2007-08-01 18:49:00,7806,In honour of recieving my BULL MOOSE TAG in the mail today... I thought I would post my wish picture!!!  
99889,ccmtcanada,2007-08-01 18:50:00,7971,Guess that pretty much eliminates the catch (shoot) and release aspect of the sport.
99899,OhioFisherman,2007-08-01 19:06:00,6623,Won`t you be awful close to the breeding gear?
99908,Fishnfiend,2007-08-01 19:15:00,357,That's awesome!  It would be way better to drive out like that than dragging 1500 lbs of dead weight.
99909,Whopper,2007-08-01 19:16:00,2174,  LOL too funny Paul
99915,Jay T,2007-08-01 19:27:00,282,"OH YEAH! I can't wait either. We have 2 Bull tags and 1 Cow tag for Bow season (outfitter tags)   . We start the hike sept 15 for a 17hr drive north then fly for about 1/2hr then we be in paradise. 2 weeks of great hunting and fishing with my Dad and Bro.  Good luck, Shoot em straight."
99916,solopaddler,2007-08-01 19:28:00,8605," Fortunately when the moose is chopped in half the breeding gear becomes non functional  . Boy, that's alotta sausage, bet that beast was shot in Alaska."
99922,Terry,2007-08-01 19:40:00,14456,"man that is one big moose.. with all my gear and boat and motor, I don't think there would be room on my atv for that"
99926,Daplumma,2007-08-01 19:46:00,1961,I would have to hang lots of blaze orange on that before I would drive out with it.Some guys see horns and shoot! Joe
99927,OhioFisherman,2007-08-01 19:46:00,6623,It`s cut in half? I wouldn`t shoot anything I couldn`t carry! here mousie mousie!LOL
99947,silvio,2007-08-01 20:47:00,433,Now thats what you call an air bag!!
99978,marvin,2007-08-01 22:35:00,37,Thats funny. Gotta give credit to the bike manufacturer for being able to take that plus rider.
100027,Smokey,2007-08-02 01:45:00,1278,"Been there done that, but being down in the States right now I have no Idea of how the draw went for me.  Seasons not far off though."
100031,Clampet,2007-08-02 01:49:00,1947,Quite the rig!
100035,Rizzo,2007-08-02 01:52:00,4754,"  :D    not sure Silvio if you had the first quote in mind when you made yours, but thats pretty funny"
100046,silvio,2007-08-02 02:26:00,433,Lol glad you got it Rizzo.
100048,silvio,2007-08-02 02:30:00,433,Hopefully the rider straped the you know what down would suck to ride back with that thing flying around.
100124,SlowPoke,2007-08-02 09:02:00,2984,"TJ, I hope when you get yourself a pet moose you'll have enough sense to make him wear a helmet. The moose in the picture is at risk of serious injury, or worse. -Brian"
100182,redfin,2007-08-02 12:58:00,79,trolling for wolves?
100183,dustink,2007-08-02 13:00:00,526, ain't that the truth.......
100194,caper,2007-08-02 13:39:00,210,Betcha that picture looks much worse from the other side of the bike!  Just got home from camping to find my COW moose tag in the mail....Looking for ward to the fall but I'm not wishing the summer away by any means..
100214,Tacklebuster,2007-08-02 14:54:00,303,"  Good one.  I guess that makes it into Guiness for the worlds largest bucktail.   Yup, won't be long now."
