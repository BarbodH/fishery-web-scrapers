99711,ehg,2007-08-01 03:04:00,2666,"Took my 4 yr. old daughter to the beach at Bluffers Park in Scarborough since someone at my workplace said they have a nice beach and you could fish. Great place for GTA'ers to take their kids in the summer. Hard to believe this is Toronto! All the sand is combed by a tractor to remove rocks. Really at first seemed like a different country.  My child loved it down there.    Lots of sand to keep the kids happy.   Saw some Trumpeter swans by a bridge there, they had black beaks.   Did the panfish microtube/jig stuff. Caught perch and sunfish. Also saw my first dreaded goby.   Anyways, thought i'd put up a summery post, seeing that it was 34 degrees Celcius on my thermometer today.  cheers,  ehg"
99725,StrikePro,2007-08-01 03:24:00,29,Is that by the mouth of the Rouge?
99730,sharper,2007-08-01 04:09:00,279,Hopefully you killed the goby.

99746,motv8tr,2007-08-01 07:52:00,2587,"Yup, nice place, haven't been there in years...one of the forgotten gems for sure....nice way to spend a day  Maureen"
99765,lunkerbasshunter,2007-08-01 11:34:00,2585,nice to see some good news coming from scarlem for a change.  Cheers!
99771,ccmtcanada,2007-08-01 11:44:00,7971,"Great report!  Kids just love the beach...there's something about a sandbox ""bigger than your house"" thing...LOL.  Looks like a great time was had....and who'd have thunk it was Scarborough???"
99789,blaque,2007-08-01 12:29:00,2419," There ugly little bait stealers lol. Seriously though.........Im no biologist, but they are an Invasive species that were dropped into the Great lake ecosystem and are not welcome for a few reasons, again im no marine biologist.....But any foreign species is a threat when introduced. One downfall is that they feed on the zebra mussel, which is basically a toxin laden creature that filters the waters of the great lakes. Hence the goby is going to be concentrating those toxins within themselves. And as you follow the foodchain, the smallmouth bass gorge on the goby wihich inturn snowballs the transfer of any toxins found in the goby into any sportfish that feed on them. Im not sure on this, but this is how Ive understood the problem. Also, The goby reproduces quite rapidly and this is a problem for the reasons mentioned above along with the fact that they interfere with catching sportfish on some days........like i said, some days they just deplete your bait without a chance to hook your target species. And again, they are ugly little creatures lol. It was funny because when the BASSMASTERS were here in BUffalo last week, one of the guys on teh podium was asked what made this area such a great smallmouth fishery......and his response was.......Zebra Mussels clearing the waters of the lake (smallmouth are sight feeders and water clarity is key for smallie fishing) and the Goby, because the smallmouth feast on them and that makes for some  FAT bass. The goby is plentiful and therefore the smallmouth have no competition for food. Both good points, but both invasive species seen as a detrement by us, were said to be a benefit by pro fisherman. So well see where this whole zebra mussel goby thing goes in the years to come. Im certainly curious."

It's a gorgeous spot, and the water is clear as any beach I've been too! It's also been classified a ""Blue Flag"" beach...  Anyhow, I've always liked the Bluffs...nice pics!"
99801,Tacklebuster,2007-08-01 13:24:00,303,"Goby's also eat the eggs/spawn of bass, walleye, whatever, but they are high in protein, and favoured by the Japanese.  Bluffer's park is located at the end of Brimley Rd.  What is a blue flag beach?"
99804,snag,2007-08-01 13:37:00,1932,"As dreaded Gobies go, that looks like a keeper! Seriously, I've caught a few and that's a big one.  Thanks for the hot spot, maybe I'll take my son there."

100036,ehg,2007-08-02 01:56:00,2666,"The beach is real nice on the far east side!  Sorta why i put the post up, thinking someone would take there kid panfishing or to the beach there. Got tired of the little gobies stealing the worms so put the jig/tube under a float off the bottom.  Not dissing Scarborough, heck i grew up in Oshawa.  cheers,  ehg"
