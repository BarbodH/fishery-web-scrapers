100262,TJQ,2007-08-02 16:53:00,7806,Got up to Camp again for a few beautiful Days with a bunch of friends of ours... The waether was hot and it was sure hard on the beer....  Heres some pictures...  Getting ready for the drive in     Arrival and the first COLD beers...    Ahhhhh  camp......  quiet....     Maiden Voyage of the Bass Baby on the Montreal River!!    Topwater heaven!!    Happy dude!!    The bass were on!    Lotsa good Topwater action right off the dock!    Our ducks were still around... even the dogs didnt bother them too too much.    More topwater...     Not a breath of wind for a couple of days...    Movie screen setup... one of our buddies brought up a Pocket Projector.. we watched Trailer Park Boys and Harry Potter - ON the big screen!!!    Morning Mist    Tookie hauling in the big ones....    There thats better.    Small one fought like champions.      Even Muskie got out for a ride.    It was a great 4 day trip. Hot but no rain. Fishing was OK.. big ones were hard to find.. but we did find a new pickeral spot. Wre going abck up in a week or so to start the framing for the 16 x 20 tent. I can't wait.
100282,Roy,2007-08-02 17:41:00,13728,Looks like another great time. That thing you're fishing from looks like a chunk of your dock. Someone should get up there and warn those ducks about hunting season.
100286,dustink,2007-08-02 17:46:00,526,Looks like another great trip to camp!!  Always love seeing these reports....  dk
