99872,Terry,2007-08-01 18:04:00,14456,"well I thought I would take the folding boat out on cooks bay this morning before it got too hot  I got another gas tank for the 5 horse honda, so I was going to try it again put the boat  together and off I go      I thought I would go to the area that I get the big walleye......none today the motor overheated..so I stopped and did some fishing the pike were biting and the bass too.......  I snapped a few pictures but not very good holding the fish out as far as I can              it's Wed. so I dressed down.....just for Roy         here is a little video of the boat going   <embed width=""448"" height=""361"" type=""application/x-shockwave-flash"" wmode=""transparent"" src=""http://i17.photobucket.com/player.swf?file=http://vid17.photobucket.com/albums/b71/mrbeeeeMrbeee/8905f71e.flv""></embed>"
99873,ccmtcanada,2007-08-01 18:13:00,7971,Great report Terry!  Love the animated gif of the assembly of the boat.  The video was a real nice touch too!  Oh yeah...nice fish....LOL.
99874,Joey,2007-08-01 18:14:00,9122,"You know, for something that folds down flat, that's pretty neat Terry.  Nice part fish pics too  Joey"
99878,Terry,2007-08-01 18:20:00,14456,"yeah that's why I took the pics of putting it together and running across the lake, most people think it's something you would use in a swimming pool not a lake but it really is a safe boat very stable too"
99881,Guest mistyriver1,2007-08-01 18:26:00,0,"That's a great set-up you have there Terry.  Look at how nice and quiet Cooks is, sure wasn't like that on Sunday  Great looking fish, nice report."
99882,pikehunter,2007-08-01 18:28:00,1659,Nice job on the pictures and video Terry.  The boat looks like it moves along pretty good! But why did your motor overheat?
99893,lookinforwalleye,2007-08-01 18:56:00,4399,Wow it looked like you`re tooling down the lake at 30 mile an hour I just hope that thing does not decide to fold back up on you while your`re going water sking speed. That would be one interesting video!
99898,misfish,2007-08-01 19:02:00,29133,"Boy you sure do get around with that little thing.Great report.  Just got back myself bud.Got some editing to do and I,ll have the report up.Boy arm is a little sore.LOL"
99902,solopaddler,2007-08-01 19:08:00,8605,"Great report! It's interesting to me to see the video of your portaboat and how stable it is. I used to own an older 10' model for back lake fishing, almost round in shape when assembled. It was like putting a motor on kiddies wading pool. I called it ""The Floating Death Trap"""
99913,bassmaster4,2007-08-01 19:22:00,801,great fish and thats a cool video
99967,fatherof3,2007-08-01 21:41:00,1769,great report looks like you had a good day
100020,Rizzo,2007-08-02 01:30:00,4754,nice report...looks like you need longer arms though  :D
100173,charlesn,2007-08-02 12:36:00,551,"Terry, that thing is cool.  You should start a tournament series.  Everyone has to start in the parking lot with the boat folded up and upon the shotgun blast off you have to carry the boat to the water like a surfboard.  lol  Charles"
