You could have gone anywhere on Nipissing. We focused on pickeral and were not disappointed. We ate fish every day with lots of fish going back in the water. A little over 20 slot fish caught in total. Picked up a few big smallmouth and some big sheepshead as well. We weren't early risers by any stretch of the imagination and still managed to catch good numbers of fish in the middle of the afternoon. There were a number of boats around, but when it came to fishing, it seemed pretty quiet on the water, the only ""crowd"" really was on Wednesday morning when there were about six boats working  a couple shoals close together out by the gull rocks.
