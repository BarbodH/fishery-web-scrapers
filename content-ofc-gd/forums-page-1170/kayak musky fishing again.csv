A small musky jumped outta the air and spit the hook, and a bigger one spit the hook at the yak. Now I can't wait to get out again next weekend. I was targeting bass, but I guess the musky gods are calling me. Next weekend I'm gonna answer that call! I just gotta figure out how to do that figure 8 thing outta a kayak."
92111,charlied,2007-07-09 17:32:00,584,nice...I was gonna get a kayak for fishing also....but bought a house instead.  Now I am thinking I should have bought the kayak as I have no time to fish now....LOL.  Hopefully next time you land one and maybe geta  pic.
92115,Weeds,2007-07-09 17:38:00,782,"So did you get any bass? Curious, what lure were you using?"
92118,ricoboxing,2007-07-09 17:41:00,398, i was using a white spinnerbait. maybe i'll go buy a mepps musky killer and catch me some bass!
92124,k-max,2007-07-09 17:47:00,20,"Hooking into a good size musky in a kayak could be a little bit like water skiing, im sure they would pull you around for a nice tour of the lake...  Reminds me of a fishing show I saw once of some guy catching a huge sturgeon from a float tube..."
92140,jediangler,2007-07-09 18:14:00,1923,"Rather than figure 8, try a few big ovals with about 2' of line out at the end of your cast. Put your rod in the water almost to the reel. I do a couple on one side of the boat and then change hands and do a couple on the other side of the boat, without removing the bucktail from the water. When I'm pretty certain I have no followers then I'll cast again. I've landed three this year from Sturgeon but I'm hoping to try Pigeon this coming weekend.  Good luck."
92267,addict,2007-07-10 01:23:00,475,takin a nantucket slay ride while a lunge tows your yak thats freakin cool man.
92437,danw,2007-07-10 14:04:00,72,"Cool, sounds like fun. I was considering getting a kayak myself too.  If bigger boats drive by do you do okay? or do you get tossed around?  I am always reading how the muskie spits out the hook, are you using single hooks are treble hooks?  Good luck!"
92446,ricoboxing,2007-07-10 14:12:00,398,"most of the boats that see me slow down so there is not much of a wake, but you get some asses that dont care and whiz right by you. then i get tossed around a bit. \\when i see a boat coming, i just try to paddle as far away from their path.  I was using a spinnerbait so yes a single hook."
92569,jediangler,2007-07-10 18:57:00,1923,"Hey danw, as long as you can get the nose of your kayak around to face the wake you'll be OK. I use a bucktail for kayak musky fishing, but with only a single treble hook. It's addictive so be prepared to never want to fish any other way again."
92848,singingdog,2007-07-11 12:01:00,1047,"Yep, once you fish out of a kayak you will never go back - except to wading. Check out Rapid Medias new mag: Kayak Angler.
