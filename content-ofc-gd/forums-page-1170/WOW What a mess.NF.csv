100138,danc,2007-08-02 10:43:00,4677,I watched this most of last evening on CNN. This story had an impact on me because I've been over that bridge dozens of times. I would have been crossing it this September as well. Incredible story.
100140,OhioFisherman,2007-08-02 11:13:00,6623,"I was asleep last nite early and missed the story, it`s all over the news here now. Lot of people still missing."
100141,ccmtcanada,2007-08-02 11:22:00,7971,"Pretty scary...7 confirmed dead, about 20 still missing.  Heard a story of a school bus with 50 kids aboard....all survived!!!"
100186,Joey,2007-08-02 13:16:00,9122,"I'm no expert, but don't they have bridge inspectors that are supposed to make sure things like this don't happen?  Thanks for the link Dan.  A tragedy for sure  Joey"

100192,Joey,2007-08-02 13:38:00,9122,"Oops, sorry B, too early in the morning.  Haven't had my coffee yet, DOH.  Joey"
100193,OhioFisherman,2007-08-02 13:39:00,6623,"Joey, the squeaky wheel gets the grease, right now the squeaky wheel is Iraq. A lot of the bridges here are older and in need of replacement or repair. There was a report here that like half the elevators in Cleveland haven`t been inspected in 10 years? Nothing seems to get done until a tragedy"
100203,skiel,2007-08-02 14:09:00,30,I was on that bridge twice yesterday and last week at least a dozen times. The bridge was inspected within the last year and a half and given a clean bill of health. Either something was missed or the inspector did not do a good job. They were working on the bridge doing re-surfacing but were not doing anything structural.  This is very sad for a lot of families now waiting to hear word. 20 or so missing.
100209,Joey,2007-08-02 14:42:00,9122," Wow Skiel, that must just freak you right out!!!    I think you'd better go buy a lotter ticket, you are very lucky right now.  Joey"
100229,mcallister.grant,2007-08-02 15:49:00,327,"I am not sure what the weather is like down there but when temperatures start to become excessively hot things start to soften up. I am not saying that is the reason, but I am sure the stell structure must have expanded with the warm weather that may have contributed to its collapse. Nonetheless, it is a terrible tradgedy and my thoughts and prayers go out to the people involved."
100233,BFSC Kevin,2007-08-02 16:00:00,1351,very sad to hear this./
100260,OhioFisherman,2007-08-02 16:51:00,6623,"Skiel glad your ok, reports on the news are saying the bridge, like a lot of others here was structurally deficient but not an urgent fix."
