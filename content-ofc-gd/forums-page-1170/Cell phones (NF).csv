100351,jedimaster,2007-08-02 20:49:00,3472,100 percent for sure Bell will NOT work there. Rogers is your best bet.
100367,caper,2007-08-02 21:39:00,210,I don't know about that area but I know that the two places I go hunting and another where I go to my buddies cottage none of their rogers phones work and mine with bell works so I'm sure it really depends on the area where they have towers. It's best to ask someone up there which works best. That's the only reason I stay with bell because the places I go it seems to work best even though I get a ton of dropped calls right in the city! Go figure

100421,Terry,2007-08-03 01:24:00,14456,buy a directional  base antenna and put it on a tower or the roof of the cottage point it at the closest cell tower and you are good to go
