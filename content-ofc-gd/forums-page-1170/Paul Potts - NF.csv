Within a week, Pauls CD reached number one in England and is on pace to break all records for a debut album (it is currently selling more albums than the next nine combined). He has been credited with introducing millions of younger people to Opera and millions of people who may have not ever had a reason to listen to it. He is just now gaining fame and recognition in Canada and the US with his album released here last week and it previewed at number 10. So how will all this money and fame affect a cellphone salesman? We'll soon see.  I am introducing a 'Remember Paul Potts' program at work...designed to get our managers to realize we may have incredibly gifted people selling cell phones when they should be singing opera...if only we take the time to look...except we don't sell phones..but you get the idea. He has even got his teeth fixed!"

He went from zero to hero as soon as he opened his mouth, it was brilliant to see made the hair on the back of my neck stand up nice for the good guys to get a result didnt know he had got his teeth fixed, that was one of the things that made him such a hit, you could tell from some of the interviews he gave that he had a hard time at school and with life in general, I hope the bullies who gave him such a hard time are choking on their words / deeds.    Great stuff"
