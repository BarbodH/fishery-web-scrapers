99990,MJL,2007-08-01 23:24:00,2427,I upload my pics onto Photobucket and copy the IMG link onto here.  With Photobucket you don't have to resize your pics when you upload them (At least I haven't had to in my experience).
100181,bigcreekdad,2007-08-02 12:55:00,546,"MJL....got photobucket set up, but unsure how to link that site to this to post a pic....you said IMG or something....can you explain further? Thanks"
100189,ccmtcanada,2007-08-02 13:22:00,7971," Hopefully this helps....  Go to your photobucket album and click in the yellow box beside ""IMG Code"".  You should see a little box that says ""Copied"" when you click there.   When posting simply follow these instructions....    You'll have to click on the ""click to view full image"" at the top of the pics in my reply if you cant read the text I've typed on the images.  PM me if you are still having problems.  Good luck!
