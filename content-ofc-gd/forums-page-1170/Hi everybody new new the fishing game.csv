99928,Family Fisherman,2007-08-01 19:47:00,9,"Hey Nick,   Follow fisherfolk on this site have suggested the Toronto islands. I would either search the internet or search this site (Toronto Islands) for more info.   Cheers and good luck...   Family Fisherman"
100060,sharper,2007-08-02 02:58:00,279,I would have to agree with FamilyFIsherman. Toronto Island is the best urban spot to catch fish in T.O.
100065,MJL,2007-08-02 03:08:00,2427,"Anywhere you go along harbourfront has gobies.  Stick a worm on a small hook, drop it down to the bottom and you're guaranteed to get them as long as you have bait.  They're not the most fun fish to catch but you can help rid the great lakes of them by destroying as many as you can.  Islands is a good bet for all sorts of fish  Here's a link about fishing around the GTA www.mnr.gov.on.ca/MNR/pubs/UrbanFishing.pdf"
100115,motv8tr,2007-08-02 07:06:00,2587,"Hey Nick, Welcome to the board, you've come to the right place.  Follow the advise of those above and you'll do well.  Maureen"
