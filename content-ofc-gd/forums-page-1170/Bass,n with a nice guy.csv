I started out catch,n right off the bat, while my local water friend was finding the bite a bit tough,but as the day went on,he put the hurt on.Remember,he,s over six feet and a big guy so fish look small.LOL  Baits for the day consist of wizzles and spinner baits along with some top water.  We probly caught over 40 or so mixed bag of buckets and small mouth. The action was awesome.                The bigg,n of the morning,4 and change on a wizzle tomatoe core.    One fish that was caught had what looked like red bleeding boils. NASTY    Thanks for the day out you nice guy you.LOL"
