99514,Fishmaster,2007-07-31 16:18:00,920,"What a amazing week of fishing on Lake Erie and Lake Ont ...Very tireing but awesome fishing .... I had charter's on Erie all Week and pre fished Friday night with Bowen his Dad Chris and a awesome lady from the fishing sites.  Got out Friday night after doing some maintenance on the boat. We were off the dock a little after 7pm set up around 8 pm and it was none stop walleye coming in the boat ...  Saturday was derby time, headed to our last night location and wasn't long the net was landing big eye's . Heard on the radio winning fish was over 11 lbs and our biggest was just over 9 lbs so I wasn't waisting anytime running to the scales . Low and behold Sunday 1st fish landed was over 10lbs and never even put a scale on it cause the fish we had the day before looked much bigger . Brandon says at 12 pm sunday afternoon we should check the weight on this fish .. Dumb asses we are its bouncing the scale at the 10lb mark after 8 hrs in the cooler ...with 12 rods in the water I yelled pull lines time to run .. Needless to say the Remis a little slow to make it back ...thanks Sonny for helping us try to get the winner back to the scales and thanks Brandon for risking life and limb to make it in time for the 1pm scales closure ...well you guess right 2 min to late for a cash prize ! We left with our heads between our legs ...yes you guys can kick me now for wanting to fish and not weigh the fish when it was caught ..anyways it was a blast fishing with Bowen, Jen, Scotty, Kevin, and Brandon for the weekend ...hope you all enjoy your walleye fillets ...lures were Small dipsys 250 back on a 2 setting with harnesses and a big dew worm ..more post coming soon after the Fishfull Thinking Show On Erie for Walleye with Charlie Wray Thursday ..      Triple header   Salmon Fishing last night with a lady and her boyfriend.  This woman booked the charter for him as a gift and all I heard was this was his best gift ever .. We fished from 3:30 till 9:00pm and landed 10 kings from 18 to 25lbs ..and man were there arms soar at the end of the night ...wire dipsys back 180 on a 2 1/2 setting was the hot ticket with Spin Doctors 180 fow .. Here are a few pics ...     Fishmaster Ultimate Charter's http://www.mountaincable.net/~fishmaster"
99523,Rich,2007-07-31 16:46:00,3927,Wow those are some huge 'eyes. Nice kings too!
99530,StrikePro,2007-07-31 17:08:00,29,What were you running behind the spin doctors?  I've been trying to get them to work for ages now!
99532,bassman,2007-07-31 17:08:00,384,Nice haul. I will definitely keep that charter on file for any future outings. There prices are reasonable as well.  Cheers!
99537,fatherof3,2007-07-31 17:22:00,1769,"wow,another great report and a ton of fish, congrats"
99538,Fishmaster,2007-07-31 17:22:00,920,"Nk flies and Atomik Flie 18"" no see'em and green crinkles .."
99539,Whopper,2007-07-31 17:23:00,2174,"Very impressive catch Fishmaster! We've been banging the eyes over in the western basin all season and haven't broke the eight pound mark yet. Like I said in Jen's report love your boat and that is cool with the depth finder mounted on the transom, save for some sore necks.  Thanks  Whopper"
99541,StrikePro,2007-07-31 17:30:00,29,You kept all of those eyes?
99546,Whopper,2007-07-31 17:45:00,2174," Nothing wrong with what Fishmaster is doing, rather see him get them before the commercial guys do. Just a drop in the bucket compared to what's there."
99548,Fishmaster,2007-07-31 17:56:00,920,You ask me info then post this ...yes we keep all our walleye if you pay $600 for the day you would wana keep them too ..and pulling fish off bottom from 69 to 78 fow is just catch and kill if you release them ..
99550,Tacklebuster,2007-07-31 17:59:00,303,"I can't get over the size of those eyes, sorry to about your winning fish, oh well, fish and learn."
99554,StrikePro,2007-07-31 18:08:00,29,"Yes, well I suppose you're right. Were you running flies behind the dipsy divers?"
99563,ozaibak1,2007-07-31 18:27:00,401,"Wow those are some monsters! I dont see the point of ppl asking if the fish were kept or not, I think thats besides the point, and is a personal thing as long as it is legal."

99626,highdrifter,2007-07-31 22:21:00,2534,"Sweet.  Those are beautiful beasts from the denisons..  Begs the question though:  How much of that eye flesh is actually consummed before it's tossed..  Guess while the stocks are high, it doesn't really matter...  HD"

99961,LeXXington,2007-08-01 21:33:00,1928,"Excellent report Fishmaster, looks like you have a booming business, I would recommend you with that boat  Odd questions for you, I see you catching the bigger eyes, Not that there is anything wrong with that at all.  Do you catch any of the smaller ones with the same set up, I was thinking of heading out there for a nice feed, I personally prefer the smaller ones 1-3 lb range.  Any help you have would be most appreciated.  LeXX"
99975,fishdawg,2007-08-01 22:17:00,912, interesting a good day nonetheless
