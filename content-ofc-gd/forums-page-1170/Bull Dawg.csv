99921,mattyk,2007-08-01 19:39:00,2110,Has any body used the musky innovations Bull Dawgs? Would you reccomend them? How exactly do you fish this lure? Thanks.

99949,joonmoon,2007-08-01 21:01:00,528,"They are rather unique lures, Trolling in deep water is good with the large ones and casting some of the smaller versions onto rock shoals in the wind or across the tops of weedbeds is good...experiment and let us know."
99959,Rich Clemens,2007-08-01 21:32:00,3131,"I have a couple magnum dawgs and I troll with them.  I can't imagine casting those things, but maybe some do.  I've tried trolling and just wind drifting with these things and have nothing to show for it.  I've heard some folks having good success with them, so maybe my day will come.   I have also picked up some of the shallow dawgs, but won't get an opportunity to give them a try until this September."
99989,solopaddler,2007-08-01 23:23:00,8605," Yeah I know what you mean...just too big and heavy for casting plus they're so freakin' ugly, I mean what fish in their right mind would actually want to eat one of these things?   Now maybe one of these dyed chartreuse...something a little sexier would be better!   "
99992,Crazyhook,2007-08-01 23:28:00,1154,word on the street is I love em  if you hate them please PM me for bait trade
99993,solopaddler,2007-08-01 23:33:00,8605,"  What, it's Bull Dawg, not Bulldog? NEVERMIND!"
99996,Crazyhook,2007-08-01 23:49:00,1154,"you can fish them anyway you want, like a jerkbait, steady retrieve... fast or slow..."
100017,Rizzo,2007-08-02 01:27:00,4754,"I've had good success with them.  I'm one crazy s.ob. though, I cast em all day long, including the magnums.  Last week -end I snapped the top foot of a rod off casting one though so you have to remember to lob them out there, don't muscle them too much or you'll end up short a rod!  Never trolled one before, maybe have to give that a try.  I like the fact you can work them at any depth."
100163,Guest Trophymuskie,2007-08-02 12:08:00,0,They work good and catch a lot of fish but they only last for 1 to 4 fish maximum. It can get expensive when a stupid pike steels your tail and there goes another $25.
100177,mattyk,2007-08-02 12:44:00,2110,thanks for the input guys. I might have to give one a try.
