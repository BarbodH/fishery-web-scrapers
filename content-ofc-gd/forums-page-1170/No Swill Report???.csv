99880,ccmtcanada,2007-08-01 18:24:00,7971,I've been looking for one too...this is what Tony wrote on the pinned swill thread.... 
99895,Whopper,2007-08-01 19:00:00,2174,"Must be one of those ""What happens at the swill stays at the swill"""
99897,bowshep,2007-08-01 19:00:00,378,"So you  want to know about the swill well as my emagination recalls: Uncle Buck got into a fight with the door man, Sonny was dancing on the bar with his shirt off using it like a prop for a dirty dance, while Tracker was cheering him on, l was being regected by my sexual prowless and Tony and his wife were imbarrassed to be around us. Well like l said my emagination. It was a great social event got to match faces with the names and just so every on know's the pic of tony in not one of him  lol."
99976,Tarzan's Jane,2007-08-01 22:18:00,1183,"  Well now...were you rejected by Uncle Buck, Sonny, Tracker, Tony...who would be so bold as to reject you...we need to talk.  hahahahahah, seriously..we will talk."
99991,Dondorfish,2007-08-01 23:25:00,1000,   Chrome Hen - to answer your question - all of the above - and I DO mean all of the above - LOL   Don
100175,tonyb,2007-08-02 12:41:00,1637,"No photos this time, someone usually brings a camera so I didn't bother to bring mine.  I think the next swill at the Firehall will work out better since we can stroll down to the pier afterwards and cast glow spoons for Salmon.  Now that will be report worthy!  Tony"
100197,Mike Pike,2007-08-02 13:56:00,1332,"If I'm not mistaken Tony, that's how the original Swill began.  The gathering of board members began on the pier chucking hardware and then moved into the Firehall where the lies would begin...  LOL"
100315,blr,2007-08-02 19:12:00,3,"Twas a good time, nice to put faces and personalities with the board names. Biggest dam chicken wings I've seen in a long time,,,,,,and good too.....matter of fact took some chicken home and liked it so much I slept with a leg in hand and a breast in the other..  Was  gonna arm wrestle Uncle Buck double or nothin for the stuff I sold him, but quickly came to my senses.....  Good people, good talk, and this ole dog might even have learned a thing or too...  thanks brian"
