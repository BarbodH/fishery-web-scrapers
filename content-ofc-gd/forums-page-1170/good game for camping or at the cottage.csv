You set them up and throw 2 dice. Whatever it is, you flip down any combination,1, 2 or more to count out the score. Keep playing till you can't count out any more, then you let the next person go. Any unused numbers go on to your score' get to 45 and you are out. Try it out, my buddies at the cottage all asked for one to be mailed over, after 30 minutes, they were all hooked. Great for beery nights with the boys, and with the kids Play it for quarters, try to win their pocket money back Played Washers when I was over, can anyone tell me the rules, too much beer when we played it, would like to try it over here."
