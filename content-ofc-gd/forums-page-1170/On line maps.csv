Remember that it would take about 21 hours at 100 km/hr to go from east to west boundaries of Ontario,  and you would see lush farms of wheat, corn and barley, and cattle ranches great flats and rolling hills.  You would also see some of the most rugged and beautiful lakes and rivers, inland seas.  There are also large cities and heavy industry and kulcha.  East to West by Google.  Dont forget to click on the 'satellite' or 'hybrid' buttons on the top right.  Scroll to zoom, and click and drag to pan.  The beer is good too with some fine local ales like Nickel Brook, a fine blend of dark, sweet and bitter.  If you like, I can scoop all the bumpf outa the Tourism centre in Fenelon Falls in a week or so, and put it all in a mailer.  That should give you an idea of what the area east and north of Toronto is like.  The group of lakes is called the Kawartha lakes, popular fishing destination around here."
