100012,Sounder82,2007-08-02 01:16:00,4,"Hi all,  Well, what a scorcher it was today in the Kitchener area.  With the mercury bubbling around 34 degrees C + the humidity, I thought, what a great opportunity to head out to Valen's conservation area and doing some fishing, rowing, and soak up a few rays.  I could not believe how many people were out on the beach enjoying the warm day, looks like a great place to take your family.  The way things were going, I thought I should take a scenary pic 'cause I didn't think I would be catching anything to photo.    For about the first hour, the only thing that got a bite was my foot - tons of deerflies and I forgot the OFF at home.  But after that, the fishing picked up and caught my first two panfish, ever.  I was surprised the kind of fight they put on my 6lb line and light spinning rod.  This was my first (had another come off the hook), I am fairly certain it is a blue gill, but I'm sure someone will correct me.    Just before heading in, i had another come off the hook, and then caught this one.  I beleive its a black crappie, but agian, not 100% sure.    All around, a great few hours on the lake, and will definitely be back."

100019,Clampet,2007-08-02 01:28:00,1947,"Right on both counts, Sunfish, and a Black Crappie.  The 'Ole Sunfish, can sure slice the water!"
100034,007,2007-08-02 01:51:00,537,Looks like a good day out fishing despite the hot temps - thanks for the report.  Sure looks like a Bluegill and a Black Crappie to me too.  007
100053,Carpe Diem,2007-08-02 02:41:00,61,Those are two very pretty fish. Just about the size i am hoping to catch. Soon.  Thanks for sharing. Didn't know about fishing at Valens.
100067,2kj,2007-08-02 03:09:00,77,"Fished Valens in a canoe with a friend of mine a few years ago, middle of the summer, hot day.   We weren't getting anything and assumed maybe not much was in there.  He decides to throw on a huge 10 in plastic worm, despite my laughter and jeering.  Drops it down and says he is hung up, his hang up starts to move and pulls the canoe.   I looked down to see the biggest, fat pig of a largemouth I have ever seen.  We have fished for years on Rondeau Bay, Kwarthas, Simcoe to name a few and have seen our fair share of 4 pound plus bass, even a few 5's.  This fish made them look small in comparison.  We both guessed between 7 and 8.  No camera on the boat,  its become a superstition with us, if we want to catch big fish, the camera stays on shore."
100078,jediangler,2007-08-02 03:34:00,1923,Valens is great. The bass that won the derby this year was 5lb9oz. I can honestly say that I've never been skunked at Valens. The pike are usually pretty eager to take a bait as well. Great pics & report.
100081,MJL,2007-08-02 03:41:00,2427,"Great pics and report  Some well deserved catches for sure...Especially with the heat and humidity...At 34 degrees, you'll find me underneath a tree, napping and waiting for my bite alarms to sound.  Deer flies are vicious...Does DEET even work on them?"
100086,fatherof3,2007-08-02 03:48:00,1769,good report
100119,Victor,2007-08-02 07:28:00,1609,that's some nice color on that crappie!
100152,ccmtcanada,2007-08-02 11:45:00,7971,"Great first report!  Hope to see many more from you.   It's funny...I do the same thing...take some scenery shots in case I dont catch anything...LOL.  No huge fish, but you at least got into some.  Kudos for sticking it out thru the HEATWAVE!!  By the time I got home from work, did some chores, and put our little one to bed, I went back outside and decided not to go fishing....just too humid and didn't feel like dealing with the mosquitoes!!!  Cant catch a fish sitting in my living room!  Looking forward to reading about more fishing trips from you."
