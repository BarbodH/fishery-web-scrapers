Biggest of the day..   Kirk with a few..     "
99891,ccmtcanada,2007-08-01 18:52:00,7971,"Wow...some nice fish there...all from shore I see.  I dont believe you either, can you GPS me those coordinates so I can verify myself?   LOL.  Great job!!!"
99892,BFSC Kevin,2007-08-01 18:54:00,1351,"some decent bass there.. wouldve been better if they were fatter, they need some grub."
99904,solopaddler,2007-08-01 19:10:00,8605,"Holy jeebus, not bad for close to Cambridge!  ."
99910,Domi Fish,2007-08-01 19:18:00,46,That first Bass is bizzare looking. The head is twice the size of it's body.  Don't see that too often.
99911,bassmaster4,2007-08-01 19:18:00,801,awesome fish and from shore to boot awesome job
99944,dobee,2007-08-01 20:15:00,301,Ya a few of them were like that skinny body and huge head... lol
99950,setomonkey,2007-08-01 21:02:00,872,"Nice set of bass, looks like some of them could use a few good meals!  I have seen that before (big heads & skinny bodies) on lakes that don't have lots of forage."
99960,misfish,2007-08-01 21:33:00,29133,"Wow nice catch,but yea,they sure are under wieght for thier size."
99970,fatherof3,2007-08-01 21:52:00,1769,"nice fish,well done"
99974,Rich,2007-08-01 22:16:00,3927,Those bass are starving to death! No wonder you had such a good morning!  Nice work. I wouldn't count on that pond producing quality bass for too much longer though with bass in that sick of shape.
100061,Stoty,2007-08-02 02:58:00,2910,"  I just think its hilarious to hear that coming from a Domi fan..... Am I the only one who see's the resemblance between that first bass, and Tie Domi? Don't worry, I am a big Domi fan too, just couldnt resist that one!"
100064,lookinforwalleye,2007-08-02 03:07:00,4399,"Those are indeed some sickly lookin bass, I caught one that looked like those last year in Scugog 21"" long and lucky if it weighed 2 Lbs."
