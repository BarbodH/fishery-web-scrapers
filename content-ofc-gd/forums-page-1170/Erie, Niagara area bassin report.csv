Tried some humps and drop offs with tubes con not find the big ones. Trolled harnesses and deep divers for walleye back to Crystal (nothing!) went back shallow (the lake was picking up) caught many small bass around Crystal beach weed beds and the pier. The big lure at the pier was a simple white twister and jig head. The seas were not kind to the little Starcraft (3 of us in her today) so we decided to hit some backwaters for large mouth in the Niagara area we did alot of exploring and found a few largies and a small pike. Sorry I didnt take any pics on Erie but here are a few from the backwaters. Enjoy!       "
