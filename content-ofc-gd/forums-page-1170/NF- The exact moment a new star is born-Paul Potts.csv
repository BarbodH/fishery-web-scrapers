The judges were stunned and visibly moved. The audience quickly picked him up as their favourite. This is from the show Britain's Got Talent..the operetta is Nessun Dorma from Puccini's Turandot <object width=""425"" height=""350""><param name=""movie"" value="""
100100,fatherof3,2007-08-02 04:29:00,1769,WOW! Not my kind of music but he is amazing. Think his days of selling phones is over
100102,bigfish1965,2007-08-02 04:41:00,3382,"Not my type of music either, but you cannot help but be amazed at this guy. I have more of him and will post it one per day."
100103,Carpe Diem,2007-08-02 04:44:00,61,"Amazing!!!! Thank you so much for posting this Rick. I loved it.  Almost undetectable, but actual warm emotion from Simon Cowell. Rare. Positive feedback rare from the other stuffy English judge too. (the blonde guy, have never seen the woman before)  And his voice. Unbelievable. Once he started singing, thought it must be some kind of prank or something. Have a recording of that song which is one of my favorites. Not a huge opera fan but love Puccini. The louder the better.  He has an absolutely incredible voice, as good as the artist on my CD.(Called Mad About Puccini i think)  Pavarotti who? Book this guy for Hamilton Place. Maybe he will at least show up."
100111,douG,2007-08-02 05:57:00,2693,"I have sung with Michael Schade and Russell Braun, and this dude rocks. Incredible power and line.  Richard, just post the whole thing already.  Carpe Diem?  I love bitter opera folks."
100219,Tacklebuster,2007-08-02 15:16:00,303,"Regardless of anyones music preferences, its impossible to not acknowledge and appreciate his talent.  I am sure we will hear more of him.  If you do a search on youtube you can get quite a few videos of Paul Pott in this competition."
100220,dustink,2007-08-02 15:21:00,526,Wow....very cool!!  dk
100221,snag,2007-08-02 15:25:00,1932,A true talent
100239,thecraftyprince,2007-08-02 16:15:00,37,Encore ! Encore ! That was phenominal ! I need a kleenex.
100376,drufis,2007-08-02 22:28:00,45,That was amazing!
100406,Carpe Diem,2007-08-03 00:16:00,61,"DouG; wouldn't pay to see Pavarotti, but i know a lot of people did. They got their money back, but he disappointed   them. Suspected snobbery, not the sniffles or whatever he said it was.  Bothers me sometimes how others see Hamilton. Many hidden treasures here."
100426,danc,2007-08-03 01:29:00,4677,"Just another brilliant performance on *** Idol. It happens all the time. This guy can sing, no doubt. But will we ever hear his name two or three years from now? I doubt it. I'm a big American Idol fan. Malinda Doolittle should have won hands down this year. But she didn't. It's a popularity contest. Nothing more. I'd bet that it's all people that are aged 25 and under that vote. And they're not going to vote for this guy. Also,  Like Malinda, this guy needs some serious dental work. That's enough to get tossed aside it seems. We'll see I suppose."
100439,TJQ,2007-08-03 02:21:00,7806,Thats was pretty amazing alright!
