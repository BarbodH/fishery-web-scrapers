I love panfish but only limited to a couple of spots that produce. I understand water clarity is important and also understand that a lot of the creek banks and property around canals are privately owned. Would anyone be able to provide some general areas that I can checkout? I'm in Elmira and have driven 3 hours but would like to shorten the ride a bit. Thanks in advance for those folks that might reply."
