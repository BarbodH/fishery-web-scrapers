1083349,Spiel,2023-01-11 21:45:00,9065,"Happy New Year to all the good folks here  	I've been working on a prototype handle for Steelheader's (winter anglers) that will bring the comfort of ergonomically contoured reel seats to the game with a seamless grip that does not come with the expense of custom wood or acrylic. It's not only less money but certainly less in weight and undoubtedly less cold on the winter angler's hand.  	That being said I've finally moved from the prototype work to a completed handle now fully assembled on a vintage D&M 11'8"" Regency Series (anyone else remember D&M Rods?)  	Thanks for looking.

1083362,Spiel,2023-01-12 10:57:00,9065," Absolutely, there is an aluminum front hood concealed inside the fore grip. "

1083369,steellee,2023-01-12 21:54:00,21,Very sleek for a float rod! Still have a D&M myself as well and fish with a few guys still running them as their main rods!
