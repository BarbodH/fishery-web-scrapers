I've put rear fenders on her now, hoping that they'll slow down all the snow she throws? She doesn't like pavement, but out on the ice she just digs in and pulls like a bear. Nice to see you haven't lost the knack of being a builder/fabricator; good on you!!! Want to race???? LOL Dan..."
1082980,Terry,2022-11-30 22:14:00,14456,Yeah I need to put some type of fenders on mine too i went for a spin off road and the mud flying was crazy

1082990,DanD,2022-12-01 21:22:00,2223,"I don't have any vid of this; but when I went on a supply run into shore and didn't have the bobsled hooked behind. Just me and Sally and I was able to pour a few more onions (Throttle) to her. The guys from my crew said there had to be at the least a 20 foot tall roster tail of snow coming off the tracks. It was a sunny clear day but I had to have my wipers on full speed, or else I couldn't see out the windshield. Hit a couple of big drifts that threw so much snow on the hood and windshield that the wipers stopped. Had to stop and clear the snow off. LOL Dan..."
