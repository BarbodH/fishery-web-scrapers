I finally got out the last week to shoot a few, took a rod along too to shore fish.   my son took his Hunterâ€™s and Firearms course this spring and we got out for the first time yesterday. Heâ€™s a very good fisherman but just not really into it, he loves hunting though. Heâ€™s using a .22 I got for him for his Birthday, neither of us are used to it yet, and while we managed 5 shots at birds yesterday we alas ended up birdless, but he loved it and is pumped to go again.   Canâ€™t wait for him to get his first bird!"

1082950,Rattletrap2,2022-11-28 21:21:00,1652,Your videos are always very entertaining! Been a long while since I have seen one! Thanks
1082951,Weeds,2022-11-28 21:30:00,782,"He mentions in the post itâ€™s a .22, unless Iâ€™m misunderstanding something"
1082957,gino,2022-11-28 23:25:00,400,I believe he talked about his son shooting the .22
1082970,limeyangler,2022-11-30 14:36:00,5204,"Yup , a broken old .410 I was given 8 years ago. My son has a .22"
