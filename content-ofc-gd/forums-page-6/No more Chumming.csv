1083274,BillM,2023-01-05 17:05:00,17367,Good assumption.Â  It's still chum no matter how it enters the water.
1083276,Terry,2023-01-05 18:18:00,14456,Chumming or Â chumming with just bait fish dead or alive i thought chumming with corn other non fish items were ok
1083277,gaspumper,2023-01-05 18:43:00,393,"These rules apply to all FMZs across Ontario. Chumming is still allowed, but only with plant-based baits or artificial corn."
1083278,Terry,2023-01-05 19:38:00,14456,Exactly. Â So a chumming can would be legal
1083279,BillM,2023-01-05 20:14:00,17367,All depends on what's in the can.Â  Â The can makes no difference.

1070510,LefroyFisherman,2021-02-10 22:55:00,602,I wonder then if I'm no longer allowed to change out the water from my minnow container? Usually every couple hours you should dump the water out and then put fresh water in.
1070511,Fisherman,2021-02-10 23:45:00,7201,"Somewhere in those new regs I'm sure I saw something that noted it was okay to change water for livewells, which is pretty much the same as a minnow bucket.

In Europe, the gray heron has spread the virus, but it does so mechanically; the virus is apparently inactive in the digestive tract of birds.[2] "" They may be trying to prevent the spread of this? If the virus can survive 2 freeze thaw cycles in a conventional freezer? In pictures here of Lake Erie fish die offs there always seems to be Emerald Shiners in the pics, better not to use fish or parts for chum?"

1070556,Mr Greedydrift,2021-02-13 19:02:00,25,Sounds like leaving guts on land is illegal

1083271,SirCranksalot,2023-01-05 04:16:00,3291,so is it safe to assume that chum inside a can or other container is illegal as well as tossing the chum down a hole?
1070362,Fisherman,2021-02-06 01:41:00,7201,"From OOD, page 22. From OOD page 22. 	Chumming for fish Chumming is a common practice among anglers and refers to baiting an area to attract fish. However, thereâ€™s been longstanding confusion between chumming and regulations associated with bait-bucket dumping. For this reason, included in the 2019 proposal for multiple lines, the MNRF also sought input on clarifying these rules.At the time, the OFAH expressed concerns that the wording provided in the fishing regulations on bait bucket dumping was confusing and needed to be updated, and that the definition of bait for the purposes of chumming should be clearly defined and exclude risky baits (e.g. live or dead fish, bait-fish, leeches, frogs, crayfish, and roe. 	THE OPENER OFAH INSIDER 	It is now illegal to release or attempt to release live or dead bait or baitfish, including fish eggs, gametes or fish parts, the water, soil, or other materials used to hold any of these items into or within 30 metres of any water.

I know for a fact, somebody unaware of the consequences threw some minnows in the local Rod & Gun pond (Catawampus), 2 years later the annual kids trout derby was pretty dismal.Â  One of the guys pulled a 12lb pike out of the pond.Â  I don't have a problem using mashed up dead minnows, unlikely that would do any harm.Â  At the campground we used to dump the salmon and laker guts in the lake and watch crayfish clean that up.Â Â  One of the outfitters up north bagged all the walleye guts and had an old freezer out back of the cleaning hut and would take them to the dump every week.Â  Oh well."
