We decided before we left to try a spot my buddy had fished in the boat this past summer as our usual go to spots had been kind of slow as of late. We also thought we’d try a morning bite instead of the usual sundown bite. Things were slow at first but at 9:30am someone flicked the switch to ‘Bite’ and for 45 minutes it was game on, good fun, good company with some decent size fish.   "
