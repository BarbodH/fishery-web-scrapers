Even herring eye balls. I hooked up with a fella that makes rubber eye balls, Off The Dock baitz. Sent me a couple of packs to try out what I had visioned. Karma was sent back with some of my creations. Looking forward to giving these a go. The treble is on a fast clasp. That way if the eye ball get worn out or ripped off,you just remove the hook,slide another eye on the shank,hook back on the fast clasp and down it goes. The drop line is 10lb floro. Figured if you get a bigger fish,it will hold. I hope. The line is triple wrapped back and forth on the shank,so it will not pull out. I may need to try on some herring and whities before the late ice perch slay starts.       "

1083179,Barry Willis,2022-12-24 14:58:00,180,"I'm glad you posted this topic about the eye balls and jarred my memory. It's been almost 60 years since I have used them and forgot all about it. Sucks getting old and forgetful.  My buddies and I came up with the idea when we were kids, we ran out of dew worms one day while bass fishing  and it was quite a long trek to go home and get more on our bicycles, they worked awesome  I've used them  for everything from perch to trout with great success. Would one of you fellas be kind enough to take the and tell me how to post pics from my desk top. Being old and even older school I haven't a clue how to do it. I'm not very computer literate. My email is [email protected] Thank you very much,  Merry Christmas to all and may the new year be your best ever."

1083219,Barry Willis,2022-12-28 15:00:00,180,Thank you very much. I certainly would have never figured that out on my own. If and when I ever catch something worthy of posting I will do that.
