I'm not sure what's in the river in Moncton, but it looks like chocolate milk all the time. For future reference, a short drive will take you to Shediac (home of the Giant Lobster !). The Shediac River gets a good run of Stripers. Further afield, that entire coastline of the Gulf of St. Lawrence is Striper central, especially the Miramichi. Miscou Island probably has the best Striper fishing on the planet."
