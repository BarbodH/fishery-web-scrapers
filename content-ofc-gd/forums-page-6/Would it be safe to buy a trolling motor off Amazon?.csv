1083340,Terry,2023-01-10 21:33:00,14456,Yes it’s safe. Just check they have free return on that product
1083385,John Bacon,2023-01-14 03:49:00,3277,If you're buying direct from Amazon there shouldn't be any problem at all.   	Amazon also sells for third party suppliers.  There may be some risk from a third party supplier; but even that risk is small.
