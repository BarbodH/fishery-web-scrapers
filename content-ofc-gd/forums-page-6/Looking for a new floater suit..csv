1082806,cuba2007,2022-11-10 00:58:00,15,"Hello, I'm in the market for a new ice fishing suit...  Have a one piece now, but it's starting to go..   saw this online ( WindRider Ice Fishing Suit ) and it looks pretty good.  Never thought about a two piece suit, so any pros or cons to either would be welcomed. thanks Angler Joe "
1082807,Terry,2022-11-10 01:43:00,14456,I wore a one piece suit for about 25 years and thought it was the best way to go then I got a two piece and realized I was wrong in every way a two piece is more comfortable  you don’t condensation in it you can remove the jacket if you start to warm up too much and farts don’t slowly escape out the top of the zipper just 6 inches under your nose
1082810,AKRISONER,2022-11-10 12:32:00,5558,"As much as people say two pieces are the way to go, a top of the line one piece allows you to pop off the jacket and wear the suspender system so that your jacket is still with you while you get warm working drilling holes, walking etc there is no suit warmer than a 1 piece. And if you go through the ice (which I have) you’ll be happy that your one piece isn’t allowing a single breath of that warmth out of your body. i made the investment in a Salus odyssey suit and have never looked back. pros - it’s the ultimate survival suit, you are effectively a super ice soldier while wearing the thing, it’s like impenetrable armour against the elements. Has pockets for everything, even spots for your picks on the exterior of your suit. (Technically for flairs while sailing) a built in winch system so someone could haul you out by your full body weight. has an incredible suspender system in it that is more than just two buckle straps. they actually make just the coat if you go that route. canadian made in Waterloo, I even had a factory defect in some of the stitching near my crotch and brought it to them and they completely repaired and reinforced the area for me.  cons - it’s heavy admittedly, wearing that much armour comes at the cost of some weight. That’s what you get though with a suit that literally is impossible to get cold wearing. Ive taken that suit out in -35 in the wind and haven’t felt a single bit of cold. My hands and feet might suffer but not once have I felt cold wearing the thing."
1082815,LeXXington,2022-11-10 15:22:00,1928,A good 2-peice is more expensive that a one piece
1082816,Terry,2022-11-10 15:27:00,14456,You cheap bugger. Lol
1082822,misfish,2022-11-10 19:31:00,29133,I have used them all. My now to me is a 2 piece Striker. Zero complaints.
1082826,GBW,2022-11-11 00:33:00,8460,"I have my 1pc Mustang and been using it for years, happy.  End of season sale on an FXR floater (labled F.A.S.T.) last year so I will be trying it out this season.  If I find it cool in anyway I can add my heated (battery powered) vest that I have for when out on the motorcycle's.  I like the idea of a 2pc for the whole jacket wide open or off in the hut."
1082827,GBW,2022-11-11 00:37:00,8460,Oh and because FXR is designed for a snowmobile rider I went that route as we plan to use the ATV as much as we can this ice season.  
1082903,akaShag,2022-11-23 13:23:00,2073,"Once you are old and arthritic, you will appreciate a two piece suit.  And unless you are nick-named Horsey, you might find that it is easier to take a leak when wearing a two piece suit.  (I am thinking here of male anglers...) Salus has top-notch stuff, and they are Canadian as mentioned above.  I have their floater bibs, and an older Canadian navy surplus top.  When that top's time is done, I will be buying a Salus top to replace it. I have not tried the FXR floater stuff, but have a pair of their rain pants (bibs) and I am delighted with them."
1082904,irishfield,2022-11-23 15:22:00,26272,He needs to save funds for bungee cords! Only time I seem to wear my one piece floater anymore is to ride the tractor blowing snow!
1082906,cuba2007,2022-11-23 16:09:00,15,"Hey, thanks all for the replies.  Will be looking for the two piece, as I'm getting up there in years like akashag above!  LOL. I'm heading to the ice fishing show this Sunday.  Will hopefully be able to see some units, and decide if I'm getting one there... Thanks again Angler Joe.   "
1083036,mike rousseau,2022-12-07 01:04:00,4661,Bought a striker climate 2 piece suit with floatation (not legal floatation device)  love it  it’s actually too warm and I remove it he liners from the bibs regularity
1083039,Chuck Enwinde,2022-12-07 05:13:00,247,Good to see you back Mike.  I have a Striker Climate and would agree that it's a great suit.  I wore out a pair of bibs after many years of hard use so now I have two sets of the liners that have basically never been used lol.  Just too damn warm.
1083050,BITEME,2022-12-08 21:27:00,1968,Just my 2 cents for what it’s worth 1 piece all the way more heat control salus odessy 1800 100% faith in any temp any conditions and accidental liquid immersion…..awesome!!! cheers Biteme Esq.
1083051,porkpie,2022-12-09 05:26:00,2521,"I've been wearing a Striker 2 piece for several seasons now.  I'm all on board the 2 piece train after spending more than 20 years in a one piece.  The strikers are nothing like conventional survival suits either, they are very comfortable to wear!"
1083052,cuba2007,2022-12-09 14:17:00,15,"Thanks all for posting! I ended up getting a two piece Stryker, fits like a glove!  Gonna enjoy it for sure. Now, if only we could get some ice here, I'd give a real report! Angler Joe "
1083058,Terry,2022-12-09 16:07:00,14456,You are going to be happy with the 2 piece its the only way to go these days
1083194,GregF2,2022-12-26 22:51:00,46,"Striker Apex looks like a solid suit too.   I use a Canada Goose Arctic Rigger most of the year, but, purchased a Striker Apex this year for first and last ice.  Very well made."
1083227,David Chong,2022-12-29 20:41:00,836,"Once you've had a 2 piece suit you'll never go back. Just so much more comfortable and I've never been cool in my Striker suit! I've had a Climate and am now in an Apex! Honestly the #1 feature for me, being vertically challenged LOL are the adjustable inseams in the bibs! So nice not to be dragging your bibs everywhere!"
1083228,aplumma,2022-12-29 21:32:00,6896,I normally wear a tee shirt and shorts when I am fishing ice out of my Scotch. Does that count?  Art
1083230,cuba2007,2022-12-29 22:58:00,15,Thanks everyone for posting!  Got out yesterday for the first time.  Six inches on a local pond.  Striker suit did exactly what it was designed for.  Thanks again!  
1083234,David Chong,2022-12-30 20:43:00,836,Looking good Paul!
