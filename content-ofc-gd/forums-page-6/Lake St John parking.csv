This is close enough to home, but parking has put a serious damper on this idea. I have been seriously considering dropping my stuff off at the lake and uberring from casino Rama. Any change in parking situation his year? If anyone on here is on St John, I would gladly pay you. Thanks.  lovetofish"

1083121,16 Footer,2022-12-15 21:13:00,191,There is Bluebird park launch on the road to the airport on the south side of the lake. If your not a resident with a parking permit then you will have to pay for parking at the parking lot kiosk with your phone.  Not sure if the park lot is open or plowed in winter. The other launch at Longford Mills was open this past spring after grading and fencing. I would check it to see if it is rely closed.
