762062,Cudz,2013-01-24 04:48:00,2652,"Gibson Muskoka. Tea stained water. Pike walleye bass (LM and SM) Crappie. Lake is about 30 ft max in the north part of the narrow and a bit more in the south part. There are no fish deep as the lake has an oxygen issue. Bass relate to bass structure. Rock points, Islands, pads etc. Many small bays with pads all hold bass and pike. Pretty good fishery but you might not be successful first time. Walleye are found in pretty specific locations. I have caught 4 walleye in total there. Best bass baits Senko and weedless frogs and wakebaits Best pike baits were smaller crankbaits (not sure why) and wakebaits  PS.  Beware of Narrows!"
