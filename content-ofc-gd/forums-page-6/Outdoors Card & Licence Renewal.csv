1083214,akaShag,2022-12-27 23:40:00,2073,Good for you!¬† And thank you for your service. Doug
1083215,Terry,2022-12-27 23:52:00,14456,Yeah they waited till I was over 65 to let former armed forces personnel to fish without a license. ¬†Why couldn‚Äôt they do it years before lol
1083216,akaShag,2022-12-28 00:12:00,2073,and thank YOU for YOUR service!
1083221,BillM,2022-12-29 19:03:00,17367,Got my new card in the mail maybe 2 weeks after ordering online.¬† Painless.
1083222,akaShag,2022-12-29 19:19:00,2073,"Painless, yes for sure, once a person could do it. My beef is they could TELL US on the website that one cannot renew until such and such a date.¬† OR, why not allow a person to renew two months in advance, or three, or ???¬† It strikes me as bureaucracy of the worst order to deny permission to renew until only a month is left in the card."
1083223,David Chong,2022-12-29 19:36:00,836,"Yeah, I ran into that as well! Thought that I would get ahead of the game and register in Nov. but found out that I couldn't! LOL"
1083225,akaShag,2022-12-29 20:28:00,2073,"That was bad enough, but THEY WOULD NOT TELL YOU what date you could actually apply!!!!¬† Bone-headed bureaucrats....."
1083226,David Chong,2022-12-29 20:35:00,836,"Exactly, I was trying to figure out what I was doing wrong! LOL"
1083229,Fisherman,2022-12-29 22:49:00,7201,"Well, I noticed it said not to apply before the 1st Tuesday in Dec."
1083231,Terry,2022-12-29 23:30:00,14456,"Yup, I read it on their site and got mine on the first day I could get it"
1083030,Fisherman,2022-12-06 15:18:00,7201,"The on line system is up and working, don't forget to print it off and carry with you, only 3 1/2 weeks until old cards expire."
1083032,Cosmos,2022-12-06 20:39:00,588,Thank you - i just renewed mine.
1083033,crappieperchhunter,2022-12-06 20:49:00,2582,Thanks for the heads up. Just finished renewing mine.
1083037,akaShag,2022-12-07 01:10:00,2073,"as of TODAY!¬† Before today you could not renew the OC or buy your small game licences.¬† Which is freakin' RIDICULOUS.¬† Like HELLO!!!!!¬† WHY can't their system let me renew my card a month before it expires? grumble, grumble, grumble..............."
1083038,Fisherman,2022-12-07 01:26:00,7201,"The shorter the renewal period, the more likely they will catch someone that forgot."
1083040,Dara,2022-12-07 12:56:00,3052,Do you need an outdoors card to fish if you are over 65 and don't need a license.
1083041,akaShag,2022-12-07 13:04:00,2073,NO. https://oodmag.com/ask-a-co-outdoors-cards-for-seniors-over-65/ 
1083042,Terry,2022-12-07 13:04:00,14456,No you don‚Äôt just a government photo id
1083044,BillM,2022-12-08 07:24:00,17367,"Good call, just renewed online.¬† We'll see how long it takes the new card to show up."
1083059,BITEME,2022-12-09 18:54:00,1968,Did you know that your cards and such are processed in the US‚Ä¶‚Ä¶
1083060,Fisherman,2022-12-09 20:19:00,7201,"Yes, have been for quite a number of years, another brain dead government move."
1083061,BITEME,2022-12-09 20:25:00,1968,I haven‚Äôt got an issue with it well ya maybe I do it really should be taken care of in house i would like to think their are people smart enough to program that in house
1083062,Dara,2022-12-09 23:34:00,3052,"Subbing out to cheapest contractor I guess. Service Ontario wanted too much. You know, having to pay decent wages and benefits they can't compete with Americans"
1083086,Headhunter,2022-12-13 13:23:00,5703,There are a number of companies capable of issuing cards here in the GTA. Priced themselves out of contention? HH
1083087,akaShag,2022-12-13 13:34:00,2073,"It is the entire licencing system that Ontario offshored.¬† Purchasing printing and mailing the OC but also purchasing and issuing the tags, etc etc. But the skeptic in me thinks the Ontario government of the day probably had a POLITICAL reason for this decision.........."
1083088,Rizzo,2022-12-14 13:04:00,4754,thanks for the reminder! I miss the old days when they would send you a renewal package as a reminder
