1083212,aplumma,2022-12-27 23:10:00,6896,You remind me of when I was a kid I had a creepy crawler maker with the hot plate and the melted plastics that I still have scars from. The joy of pouring them and the steam when you dipped them in water to kind of cool them off. The smells and the end result were what drove me to make another one. Very nice work on the bugs  cheers Art
