1083462,TJQ,2023-01-21 18:07:00,7806,Nice.. those are huge.. funny enough.. Ive never caught one!
1083464,AKRISONER,2023-01-21 20:20:00,5558,Sigh…still waiting for ice. thanks for the fish porn while I wait
1083467,limeyangler,2023-01-21 22:09:00,5204,Have you eaten crappie? I like them essay more than walleye. Crazy weather seems to be the norm now.
1083475,Barry Willis,2023-01-22 16:48:00,180,Man are those ever nice. I don't think I've ever seen crappie that big.
1083488,akaShag,2023-01-24 00:55:00,2073,"Green with envy here.  😁 Do you fish that tungsten jig bare?  I use perch eyeballs on them, for jumbo perch........ Doug"
1083491,streamside,2023-01-24 13:45:00,12,Thanks for taking us along on another little jaunt. Big slab crappies and a great incidental walleye. Nice
1083529,limeyangler,2023-01-28 01:41:00,5204,"There are some nice ones up here for sure, I guide all summer long here, and all the guys from the US say they get numbers down there but not numbers and the size we have here."
1083530,limeyangler,2023-01-28 01:44:00,5204,"This whole tungsten thing is a new thing for me this year, I’ve tried with whole minnows, minnow head and plastics, to be honest they’re like any other bait I use, sometimes they’ll munch a Smokey on a rope and some days doesn’t matter what you throw at them, they’re being picky."
1083539,Barry Willis,2023-01-28 15:53:00,180,"About 55 years or so ago I had a black crappie in the freezer that was quite big that I caught at Stokes Bay I was going to have mounted. It was cold this one day so I though I'd defrost the freezer. I put everything outside in the baskets. Upon bringing every thing  in the house and back into the freezer I noticed my black crappie was missing. It had to be my German Shepard, He never touched the beef or anything else just the crappie. I think he was ticked off at me because we hadn't been fishing for a spell as I seldom went without him. We never did see it again, not even the bag it was in Haha. I've never caught another that big. Happy Days."
