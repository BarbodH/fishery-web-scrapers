1083067,captpierre,2022-12-10 22:47:00,2521,Did a cottage run today for a peek after the big winds last week.  	Lots  of limbs down but thankfully no damage. The neighbour a few doors down had his suspended aluminum dock ripped off the hinges.  	Scugog and the bottom of Pigeon skimmed over.  Gannon Narrows and upper Pigeon wide open. No snow.
