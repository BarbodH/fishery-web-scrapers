Took them out to a small lake nearby for some fun fishing.  Being a tournament angler, most of my fishing is either tournaments or pre-fishing, where I'm trying to get them to bite but not hook them.  I really lose sight of the ""fun fishing.""  And let me tell you, I had a blast on Saturday with my two buddies.  Being a tournament angler, we still had to each weigh our 5 biggest, a little friendly competition, but no pressure, which was nice, a missed fish was frustrating, but not a costly error, takes a lot off your shoulders let me tell you.  Oh yeah, and an 8:30 launch time is acceptable... woohoo.  So we launch at 8:30 and first fish is in the boat at 8:40, Slow presentations were key ... tubes, senkos, flippin jigs and lizards all put fish in the boat for us, even a few crankbait fish.  All in all we caught over 30 fish, mostly in 4-6 feet of water, although the bigger fish came in about 8.  Andrew only had 3 fish, but they went 7lbs 1oz.    Tyler had 5 fish for 11 lbs 2 oz.    I had 5 fish for 12 lbs 1 oz.    No huge fish, but we had a blast....  Oh yeah, and out biggest 5 TOTAL, went 12 lbs 8 oz.    Thanks for reading.  SR"
