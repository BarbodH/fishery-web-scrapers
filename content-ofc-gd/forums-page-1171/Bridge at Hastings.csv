There were lots of people catching fish, mostly from the bridge though with their big hula hoops nets.  Once guy had one that I would guess weighed in at around 10 lbs.  We caught a few cats that night strangely enough, but not pickerel.  Haven't been back since it opened though...."

Caught almost all them on a silver Big O..  For the most part the bridge is a great spot to fish, but it can get over crowded at times.  If you don't feel like fishing there you can always drive to Deer Falls. It's only a few kilometers east of the bridge.  Great for Pike and Walleye..."
