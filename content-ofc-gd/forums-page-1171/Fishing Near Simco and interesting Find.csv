98870,danw,2007-07-29 16:24:00,72,"I went fishing on Friday with my dad. It was around the smaller lakes surrounding Simco. Me and my dad headed out in the late after noon. It took us longer to get there than planed because of traffic. After about 1.5hr on the road, we set up our canoe and was eager to fish.  It was a very slow day, we a few panfish and perches. Landed one bass that was about 6"". We just tossed them back, and was waiting for something bigger to be picture worthy.  The sunset was nice, the lake was calm, very good conditions for canoing.   The day continued to be slow, few more perches and came to an end when the mosquitoes started to attack us.  "
98871,danw,2007-07-29 16:25:00,72,"I caught a few perch, while I was preparing it I noticed something unusual about them. I noticed it had there was something the size of a rice embedded in the flesh. Upon further inspection they were some sort of parasite.    From further googling more info I found it was common to find them in fish. link  From the link and other links, it said it was okay to eat if cooked properly. I chose not to eat them, seeing the little critters crawling around, I lost my appetite. And I didn't want any parasites.  Here is a vid of the parasites crawling around.   So if you do decide to eat your catch, remember to cook it properly."
98872,Northhunter,2007-07-29 16:42:00,214,"I wouldn't eat that either.  Could be wrong, but I don't think that's ""yellow grub"". I've seen it many times. They've always been small and have never crawled around like that!  On an unrelated note: ""Black Spot"" is actually given its appearance by the fish. The black is a pigment that the fish produces and encysts the tiny parasite."
98877,Tacklebuster,2007-07-29 17:06:00,303,"I found them many times in bass, perch, and walleye.  Sometimes there are only a couple and you can just remove them from the fillet.  I have to agree though, they don't do much for your appetite.  However, if you cook your fish properly, they are harmless, just a bit more protein than you bargained for."
98878,bassman,2007-07-29 17:08:00,384,"I've heard about the same problem at a lake near Simcoe. If it's the same lake, the ""parasite"" has been there for many years."
98883,bbog,2007-07-29 17:27:00,665,"That videi was enough to kill my appetite, glad I'm not having fish tonight!"
98884,foggy,2007-07-29 17:30:00,38,"the perch i was getting at picton a few years ago had the odd worm i had to flick out of the fillet, but that looks too much for me."
98890,Canuck2fan,2007-07-29 18:00:00,1444,If you have ever eaten Atlantic Cod you have eaten pretty much the same thing..... The factory workers only pick out the ones big enough to see in cod...
98900,mattyk,2007-07-29 19:41:00,2110,those parasites are common in that lake.
98904,Joey,2007-07-29 19:49:00,9122,"I've picked out a few of those parasites myself from perch and bass, usually more in the fall after the water has been warmer for awhile.  I do have a limit tho, and if there are more than two I won't eat it either.  Those ones look alot longer than the ones I've seen tho.  Nasty!!  Joey"
98984,Rizzo,2007-07-30 02:16:00,4754,"ya, not uncommon in many lakes.  A lot of the time perch have them so bad you can see them in around the gill areas...no need to fillet them, you can see them if you just look at the fish!  Not very appetizing to say the least"
99009,Beans,2007-07-30 03:11:00,3339,Like Rizzo sez...around the gill area and at the base of the tail...if you see them there you can be assured there are many more in the fillets...sure as hell not very appetizing even if they are well cooked...a couple can be removed with the point of the knife but a bunch...forget it...Yuck !!!
99062,Fish Farmer,2007-07-30 12:32:00,2234,"A lot of lakes have Perch with worms. Some think it's only summer time that you will find them, I've caught Perch in the winter ice fishing and found a few. A good place to look is under the jaw embedded under the skin."
99244,fishboy,2007-07-30 19:43:00,550,"That's good ol' yellow grub-harmless when the fish is cooked properly and vey easy to ""pop"" out of the fillets with the tip of your knife.  You missed out on some tasty dinner there; I'd be willing to bet it's tought to find a perch anywhere in central/southern Ont that doesn't have any yellow grub at this time of year."
99646,fishindevil,2007-07-31 23:47:00,6254,"Yes just common yellow grub,i have even seen them in very clear deep clean lakes in quebec,and even some in alqonquin park,they are harmless,just pick them out and you are good to go,....no problem"
