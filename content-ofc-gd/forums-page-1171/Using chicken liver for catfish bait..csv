98713,oldschool,2007-07-28 17:08:00,38,Our main use of them in the States is raw.  Give them a bit of exposure to the elements to produce a distinctive aroma and the results are even better.  Roy
98731,Daplumma,2007-07-28 18:56:00,1961,"I always use them raw.I keep them out of direct sunlight because if they get too much sun they deteriorate and are hard to put on a hook.Channel cats are more likely to be caught on fresh chicken liver.They are eating the liver for the blood,not so much the rotton smell.The mudcats or bullheads seem to like the rotton stuff.Blue cats are more often caught on cut bait,the oilier the better.Good luck, Joe"
98759,tomO,2007-07-28 22:17:00,363,I catch alot of cats in the Ohio River on liver and Stipers hit it too.
98783,wallyboss,2007-07-28 23:54:00,1095,You can buy a bag of of about 60 shrimps at most grocery store for about 7.00. and cats just love em
98803,Marko,2007-07-29 03:15:00,854,I caught some nice cats using shrimp and liver fishing red river in winnipeg. Problem with chicken liver is that small fish will take it at will and you might not be able to get rid of them and have it sit there until the big fish comes by. Good luck regardless
98906,Carpe Diem,2007-07-29 20:13:00,61,"Thanks for the tips. Have a shrimp ring in the freezer that i've lost interest in. Maybe the catfish will enjoy it.  Saw someone catch a catfish out of Hamilton Harbour. They were taking it home to eat, said it was good on the BBQ. No problems if they want to eat it, but they had a young daughter. Maybe 6 or 7 years old. Yikes!!  If you were from around here you would know that isn't a good idea."
98907,Marko,2007-07-29 20:22:00,854,Jeez Everything glows in dark from the Hamilton Harbour That fish cant be too good for you
98929,Woodsman,2007-07-29 22:54:00,1286,Try tying a couple of livers in a bag (same as a roe bag) than return to a styrofoam container. Set in the sun for a day. Now ready to use or freeze for later use. The bag helps keep them on the hook.
98933,Carpe Diem,2007-07-29 23:05:00,61,Thanks Woodsman. Sounds like a good idea. Might keep the bait away from the smaller fish. Think i know what a roe bag is. Remember hearing you can use old stockings. Is this true?
98935,Woodsman,2007-07-29 23:20:00,1286, Yep. The more scent the better.
99161,Carpe Diem,2007-07-30 16:34:00,61,"Wow!!! Those catfish are huge. Also a different colour than the one i saw come out of the Hamilton Harbour.  Congratulations on taking first place Smithville-fisher, you obviously know what you are doing!!!!  Live not too far from the Grand River, though it is a big river. Took another look at your posts. Very helpful.  Thanks."
99662,fishindevil,2007-08-01 00:11:00,6254,"Channel cats also like anchovies,and they stay on your hook so you can sometimes catch a few on 1 bait.  ...the list is endless for bait for cats so just try different things and you will be suprised on what they will hit on...good-luck    cheers"
