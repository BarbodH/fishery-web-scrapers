99676,Tomcat,2007-08-01 01:09:00,395,I'm mulling over the notion of purchasing a Basket Carrier - see http://www.truckspring.com/basket-carriers_465.html for an example. I was wondering whether anyone has used these carriers for transporting 5 gallon containers of gas into fishing/hunting camps? Thanks in advance.
99705,John Bacon,2007-08-01 02:18:00,3277,I have thought of using them myself.  I do have some concerns.  The cargo may hide the license plate and/or lights.  This would be a legal and safety concern.
99812,Tomcat,2007-08-01 14:15:00,395,"I had contacted the OPP to check on legality issues. Their only stipulation was that the carrier could not obscure the licence plates. Probably just an oversight that they didn't mention not obscuring turn signal and brake light operation. When I mentioned that my plate was mounted high on the back of my truck, the OPP rep added that technically speaking, the licence had to mounted at a place that was the furthest back on the vehicle. I guess I could mount the plate on the basket carrier during such trips."
