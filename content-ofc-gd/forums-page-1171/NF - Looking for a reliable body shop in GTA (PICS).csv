I was hoping someone here could recommend an experienced body shop, preferably a body shop experienced specifically with Volvo's that I could try and call for a quote.       Thanks for any help !"
99912,snag,2007-08-01 19:21:00,1932,Not sure if this'll help.  My brother had a bunch of Volvo's. When he had any damage he would hit a volvo scrap yard near guelph on highway 6. They have a few hundred wrecks there.  Good luck!

Paint perfect, drove it another 65000 klicks without any problems, not even uneven tire wear!! I carry their card in my wallet, right beside Bill's Towing! But . . . .    they AIN'T cheap!! Here ya DO get what ya pay for though."
