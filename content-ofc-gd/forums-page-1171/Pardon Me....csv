My name is Don i am 21 years on from Niagara on the Lake On, Canada. I live 2 mintues away from the niagara river, but do not seem to do a lot of fishing there. I usually get away for 1 solid week of bass fishing (which i live for) for the summer where i head to the french river and some small lakes around there. Thats all for now."
