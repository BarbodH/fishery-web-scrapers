99767,ccmtcanada,2007-08-01 11:37:00,7971, LOL...and the fact that you had your fishing great was just a coincidence...hehe.    Do they have computers up there yet?  Sean....great report and pics.  It's great seeing you get out there and fishing...I always look forward to your reports.  Some real nice eyes there...hope the fish dinner was spectacular!  Sure is a pretty spot in the summer...I was born here in the big city...dont know if I could handle winters up there...LOL.
99832,tbayboy,2007-08-01 15:18:00,1497,"Thanks Dan I'll be taking you up on that offer for sure.  I've actually been in touch with a couple friends up there just to poke around and see what the job market might hold but I'm not holding my breath.  Next summer I think I'll have to take up air canada on the $999 all you can fly in ontario package, 4 trips and its paid for itself.  Oh and Cliff about the dinner - here's the annoying part. I go fishing Friday and Sunday to bring home some fresh fish so we can have a little dinner for the visiting out of town family (of which, by the way, I count as one) and what does my dad do?  Yeah he throws the dinner the evening AFTER I came back to Toronto.  Old bugger can catch his own fish next time"
99489,Whopper,2007-07-31 14:20:00,2174,Good report TbayBoy!  Been through the area a few times and the bay always brings a smile to my face. I'm always traveling through going north and have often wondered what lies in the water that I drive right past.  Thanks for sharing  Whopper
99512,ehg,2007-07-31 16:08:00,2666,Another great report from ya.  Thanks for posting.  ehg
99674,fishindevil,2007-08-01 01:01:00,6254,"WOW !!!!!!!! amazing scenery,and yet only mins from downtown,  i wish i could live in a place like that,and as a bonus you can catch walleyes right on your doorstep,thats what i can great area,nice report,and pics,and tasty walleyes....cheers"
99681,PatrickGG,2007-08-01 01:16:00,562,"Nicely done Sean i can picture you showing up at the wedding with sandals and shorts just so you can get that extra 5 minutes of fishing ""jk   ."
99687,danc,2007-08-01 01:45:00,4677," But he doesn't live there. I do!!!  TbayBoy, (what the heck is your real name anyways??) I've heard of some vandalism at the launch a few years ago. Sad to hear that it's still going on. I haven't been out for an evening fish yet this year, but I'm sure one or two is in the works for August. There's usually lots of people down there, that I find it's hard to believe that vehicles are being broken into. Such is life I suppose."
99690,007,2007-08-01 01:47:00,537,Nice one TBayBoy - that scenery sure beats fishing the Toronto Islands!  007
99719,tbayboy,2007-08-01 03:15:00,1497,"Hey Dan, its Sean by the way .  On Friday there was quite a few people at the launch and when we arrived Sunday there were 7 or 8 trailers but when we got back at 10:30 we were the only people there other than the poor guy that got hit (who was waiting for the cops).  Also all the lights were off (I'm sure there were lights on Friday) so that might have had something to do with the guys truck getting hit (not that westfort isn't the nicest area of town hehe).  And yeah, I'm not lucky - Dan is lucky to live there, I just get to visit a few times a year, next time up I'm gonna have to get some trout spots off you though, would be nice to mix it up a bit (I've never fished the Nipigon area for example)."
99727,danc,2007-08-01 03:38:00,4677,  Oh man. We'll go for a day trip at least Sean. You'll move back here even if you have to live in the homeless shelter. Nipigon's my reason for living.
