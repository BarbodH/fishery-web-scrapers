99224,muskymatt,2007-07-30 18:58:00,2608,"Thanks all.  I am still pretty stoked about the fattie, it was noticeably heavy lifting out of the net.  I'm going out tomorrow night for some dusk fatties, and hopefully another pic .....or three"

99448,Guest Trophymuskie,2007-07-31 10:54:00,0,What a beauty.  I know someone who would pass it off as a 50 especially with the exagerating hold.
99465,Bassloadingzone,2007-07-31 12:38:00,32,"I have never targeted musky, but I am wondering why they say that musky are so hard to catch, I seem to get far to many when im out Bass fishing,its amasing how a fish that big eats little crank baits, and boy whats up with the smell"
99466,Roy,2007-07-31 12:39:00,13728,"I don't think that was called for, Richard. Matt caught a great big fatty, let's just be happy at his success without slinging arrows at anyone."

99740,Badger Shark,2007-08-01 06:03:00,291,Matt you really are hitting them this year.  Is there something different this year?  I dont remember seeing so many reports from you or others last year with the kind of success you are having this year.  Is it because the water stayed cooler longer?  Regardless you have caught some really beautiful skis so far this year and congrats again on finally getting the 50 in. you have been after.  Hopefully we can get out soon.  Take care  Don
