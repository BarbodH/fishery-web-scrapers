99867,lookinforwalleye,2007-08-01 17:57:00,4399,Are there none for sale in this country?
99869,bow slayer,2007-08-01 18:00:00,1074,yea but with the dollar so strong the prices are about 2000-3000 less in the us.

Figure 300 million here and 40-50 million up there, bargains are easier to find here."

There's lots of Canadian car dealers right now that are buying used cars in the US and bringing them up here because of the price difference and the strong Canadian dollar.  I can't answer your question, but good luck with your purchase."
