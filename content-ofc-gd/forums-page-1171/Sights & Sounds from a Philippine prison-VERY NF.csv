Never have I seen a people so obsessed with cheesy variety shows and musicals! Almost every flippin' tv channel 24/7! The topper though was the traffic jams. They were so unbelievably bad it regularly took me 2 hours to drive 12km to my office. To ease tensions they installed ""entertainers"" at each intersection to amuse the frustrated drivers. Usually a guy in white Steve Martin suit with a big foam finger on his hand jumping around like a clown  . Ah the Philippines....what memories  ."
