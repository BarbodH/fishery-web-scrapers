99636,Sinker,2007-07-31 23:24:00,8692,"  Hey, don't feel bad.........I had my trusty old 12 foot deep and wide stolen from my yard, while we were at home a few weeks ago!!! Now I've got the place locked up like alcatraz..........ya can't trust anyone these days....its sick........and I'm out in the  country!!!  Most bad things turn good though....so don't worry....you'll find a better boat at a better price sooner or later!  Sinker"
