98849,aplumma,2007-07-29 15:01:00,6896,Sorry bud but I am to far away to help down here in the South. You might want to explain what a spotter does and you might get more interest.   Art
98857,motv8tr,2007-07-29 15:35:00,2587,"I'd do it, but like I said in the other posts...I'll be working  .  Hope you find someone.  Maureen"
98895,fishdawg,2007-07-29 18:19:00,912,"in many of the  major 1 or 2 day salmon tournaments nowadays each team is required to supply a spotter (aka observer)  all the the spotters names are then drawn & assigned to a different team/boat for the tournie, their job is basically to just be an iumpartial witness to make sure all rules are being complied with  they are not allowed to fight/land/net fish. A few friends of mine have done this & I have been told that it is a great way to learn some of the newer technique being used on the Lake from the best salmon anglers. I would like to do it once myself. As well, often you are often invited the to prefish with your team (you can fight fish then)"
99250,fishboy,2007-07-30 19:54:00,550,curiosity-do spotters help pay for gas etc?
99256,HookNrelease,2007-07-30 20:05:00,85,"the spotters do not need to dip into their pockets at all regarding the boat /teams expenses, the tighlines has a pay out of i believe $75.00 for the spotter and a draw for a digi camera, also some teams will pay extra depending on how they do etc, all you need is your own expenses, you also have to be at the team meeting friday at 7pm and then back for saturday morning start off is 6 am , but your boat may head out earlier, cheers  ian"
