Well I was looking forward to the outback trail to that lake,Im thinking it was a safe move to stay close to home as we got in just as the rains started to fall.  Simcoe did not disappoint,and as I showed you, there are some nice fish at that one spot   .Man did they follow that first fish in or what  Ok,heres the pics of my good friend and partner for the day.
