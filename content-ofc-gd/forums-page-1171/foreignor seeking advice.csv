99205,stilltrying,2007-07-30 18:16:00,2,"hello to all and thanks for letting me join the board.  I live in Louisiana, and will be attending a wedding in Welland, ON, last week of Sept. since I am not the bride or groom I don't see why the whole trip should be devoted to the event.  My father inlaw agrees, he is coming in from Nova Scotia.  Our dilema, neither of us will have out boat with us, nor would we know where to put it in or what to fish for.  Our mission is to devote a day to catching some fish, preferably whats biting.  Any and all suggestions accepted.  Creek, pond, river or lake doesnt matter to us, we will have transportation so an hour or so drive is not a problem, neither is renting a boat or going out on a charter.   Thanks in advance  Terry"
99208,danbouck,2007-07-30 18:21:00,4380,PM Fishmaster!
99220,spanky,2007-07-30 18:47:00,195,"PM Fishmaster for a charter... if you wanna do a bit of bass and pike fishing hit the welland rec. canal... salmon *should* be showing up at night in Port Dalhousie (15min drive from welland), chuck some glow spoons after dark for them...  Not really any place within an hour from here to rent a boat sadly...."
99225,Carpe Diem,2007-07-30 19:00:00,61,You can fish from shore at Port Dalhousie. A friend of mine has caught some beautiful rainbow trout there.
99239,gforce,2007-07-30 19:24:00,63,You can catch them at night?  I thought that they only move in closer to shore later in the season?
99257,Musky or Specks,2007-07-30 20:06:00,2710,"Louissianna and Nova Scotia hey, mmm , why not try for something you cant catch in either place-Musky on the Niagara."
99269,dheitzner,2007-07-30 20:56:00,314,you have a pm
99273,spanky,2007-07-30 21:17:00,195, late Sept he'll be here... usually a few in by then
99283,bigfish1965,2007-07-30 21:45:00,3382,"I would also suggest a charter. Dalhousie does have salmon at night by mid August, but it is very hit and miss. Fishmaster seems to be dialed in on the salmon quite well this year."
99290,sonny,2007-07-30 21:57:00,511,"charter would be the way to go...Talk to fishmatr chaters steve,,he cherters for differant fish too so you'll have a choice!!...i highly recommend him!"
99525,stilltrying,2007-07-31 17:03:00,2,"Thanks for all the replies, I am trying to figure out how to pm, yes we want to try for something not normally in our reach.  Here in Lousiana usually catch largemouth, small mouth, crappie, bream, catfish, stripers, white bass, drive 2 hours to catch trout, having fished a few times in Nova Scotia, freshwater seems to be limited to mostly trout, our at least thats what we fish for, mostly saltwater fish since inlaws live on the Bras dor Lakes.   We will be traveling to Simcoe this trip if this opens up any more prospects, other wise I am going to look into a charter and do some fishing from the bank.   Thanks  Terry"
