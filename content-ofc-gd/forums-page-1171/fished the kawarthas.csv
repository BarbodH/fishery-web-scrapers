99271,Terry,2007-07-30 21:03:00,14456,"well 4th day of my summer vacation and had the need to do some fishing..but I sold my nitro  so the folding boat to the rescue I decided to go to a kawartha lake with the little boat..  hooked up the 5 hp honda and off I went  well almost,   the gas wasn't getting to the motor..turns out the hose inside the tank broke...luck would have it I had the 2.5 in the back of the truck so all was well and off I go..   right off I see a bunch of dead carp.......that means it has worked it's way through the whole kawarthas and simcoe is the next stop.....     I get down to fishing and get into some perch     then into the bass    the walleye were good to me too        and of course every time I have fished the kawarthas this year I get muskie not big but great colours and markings on it I didn't take a picture of it but I did have my digi camera hanging from my neck with on video while I was fighting it it isn't very good but the sun reflecting on the lake looks like a lazer show..check it out  and my set up        <object width=""425"" height=""350""><param name=""movie"" value="""
99274,tbayboy,2007-07-30 21:23:00,1497,"Too bad about the carp but thanks the cool video Terry, that folding boat really seems to be serving you well."

99346,motv8tr,2007-07-31 00:33:00,2587,Cool little set up you got there Terry...not a bad day at all I'd say.  Maureen
99360,Tarzan's Jane,2007-07-31 01:06:00,1183,Interesting...have never seen a folding boat before.  Loved the song.  My son watched it with me and he was wondering if the fish was dead...nope...he enjoyed watching it swim away.
99366,Guest gbfisher,2007-07-31 01:16:00,0,HEy..............how did ya????.......oh never mind. Nice fish Terry.
99392,chachi1984,2007-07-31 03:14:00,7,my home lake is clear lake.  have got 6 walleye in six  daysthis year 5 keepers.  i want to catch some muskie does anyone know any good spots around there.   thanks
99398,jediangler,2007-07-31 03:26:00,1923,"The reason your musky had such nice markings on it was because it was a tiger musky. There must be some pike in that lake as well. As much as I love to see them, tiger muskies mean the end is near for musky in that lake and the pike will soon take over. By soon I mean a decade or so depending on the size of the lake. I hope your kawartha lake is on the Simcoe side of Balsam. Nice pics and that was a cool video."
99399,Skud,2007-07-31 03:27:00,739,"Hey Terry, that has to be a Tiger Muskie for sure. We will have to make a trip out there together again, maybe Cook's Bay too. My boat has spent too much time in the driveway this year."
99440,misfish,2007-07-31 09:38:00,29133," Thats not a place for a shiny new prop to be skud. LOL    Terry,where the heck am I to sit when we go to u know where?LOL  Cool vid."
