99666,bigbuck,2007-08-01 00:46:00,2449,"Sorry guys, I'm just getting out of the office now. I had a client call this afternoon who needed to see me this evening to take care of some business. I hope the wings are hot and the beer icy cold."
99671,Loonietoon,2007-08-01 00:52:00,1450,I was trying Tony but it won't pay the bills yet... Hope everyone has a safe time
99833,tonyb,2007-08-01 15:20:00,1637,"Had a great feed of wings and pints at the Firehall.  A great time as alway, met Sonny, BLR and Bowshep for the first time and saw some of the usual suspects too.  Until next time!... Tony"

95642,Loonietoon,2007-07-19 01:27:00,1450,
96128,aniceguy,2007-07-20 03:12:00,1094,seems I ll never make a swill Im on Holidays then
96219,John,2007-07-20 12:30:00,2956, And your point is...............
96280,tonyb,2007-07-20 15:12:00,1637,"It's ok aniceguy, more beer n wings for us!  I think we'll do another one in September and we can hit the pier for Kings after the swill!  Tony"
96552,Carp,2007-07-21 12:59:00,1488,"I'd love to make it, but work has been crazy lately and I don't know if I'll be able to swing it. It would be nice to see some familiar faces and a few new ones too. I need a couple of hours of chilling time. Actually, I need a couple of weeks. Fishing talk, suds, grub and good people. Heck, can life get any better ?  "
96652,bigfish1965,2007-07-22 00:54:00,3382,I'll be there with bells on! That way you can hear me sneaking up to steal your wings.
97053,ccmtcanada,2007-07-23 14:47:00,7971," Bly and I cant make this one...weekday evening are hard for us...I dont even get home from work until 6 to 630pm (Whitby)...then to turn around and head back through that Toronto mess makes it difficult.  That, and we dont have a babysitter.  The September one sounds like a plan though!  Beer, wings and fishing?  How can one pass that up?"
97089,nautifish,2007-07-23 15:19:00,1416,I think we'll do another one in September and we can hit the pier for Kings after the swill!  Tony    Make it the 4th that will be my 21st birthday!.....
97204,douG,2007-07-23 19:22:00,2693,"'We don't have a babysitter'.  Any parent with kids older than a certain age has scoured the neighbourhood, local groups like churches or community centers, and found someone that they trust after a little while.  Break em in slowly to see if they work out.  If you folks can make it to Kipling Station, I'll do the rest of the driving.  Hope you and Bly can make this one."
97263,bowshep,2007-07-23 22:07:00,378,I'm going as well if someone needs a ride l can pick you up at Downsview Station. Im not planing on running away after the wings are gone. So l could be their for more than a few hours.  Peace Ken
97558,ccmtcanada,2007-07-24 16:07:00,7971, douG...we have a babysitter...our 15 year old daughter...problem is she wont be able to sit that night...we will make a few calls around.  It's hard getting people on a Tuesday though...  We'll do our best.
97562,tonyb,2007-07-24 16:16:00,1637,"If not, make a trip of it like you said Cliff, September is a better chance of catching some night time Chinooks on Glow spoons anyway."
97577,Aaron Shirley,2007-07-24 17:05:00,655,"Can't make this one, I'm working nights.  Maybe the September swill and pier fishing.  Aaron"
97661,bigbuck,2007-07-24 22:01:00,2449,"I'm a gonna give'r the old school try to come out. Beer and wings 10 minutes from home, sounds good to me."
98374,Guest Johnny Bass,2007-07-27 11:38:00,0,Dang! I will be camping that week. We should definately have one every month but change up locations. So we can have different guys attending. And maybe have a lure swap. I have tons that just sit and rot in the tackle box.
98378,pigeonfisher,2007-07-27 12:00:00,696,"In rememberance of the Near North Angling and Swlling Clan!  Maybe someone will be there that can give an interesting history lesson on the beginning of the swill.  I think I didn't have kids then and also didn't live 90 minutes from Bronte...DANG  Most of the Swillers are gone now, off the board anyways.  Gerritt will remember, we actually had a web-site and ""secret hand shake"".  I beleive that was how Raf (BoostnAWD) became a member of the OFC.  It was a long, long time ago.  But I can still remember, the day....the muuuussssiiiicccc died.  have a great time everyone."
98380,Raf,2007-07-27 12:02:00,3495," Yeah, you guys really screwed that up didn't ya."
98604,Motorhead,2007-07-27 23:34:00,163,"  I was a member of the Near ""North Angling and Swlling Clan"".... I went to one of the first swills and sat by myself outside (in the smoking area) waiting for everyone to show up... After 3 beers I left, only to find out everyone was inside drinking... (in my defence I thought there was a few smokers in the group and I would see them as they came outside for a smoke, didn`t happen   ...) Should have maybe gone for a tour inside??? Just not thinking that night... I`ll try to make it to this one.... I`ll wear my OFC hat...  LOL  Doug"
98628,Loonietoon,2007-07-28 01:45:00,1450,"Pigeonfisher there's still a few of us hanging around , Spiel (chris) Lew, Squid (pete) Doug,Bigfish 1965( Rick) More will check in with the storys  :oops:  What can I say"
