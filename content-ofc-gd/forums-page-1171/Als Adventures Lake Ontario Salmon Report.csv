Being from St.Louis, U.S.A he had no idea what kind of a salmon we had here in Lake Ontario. The first fish of the day was a 7lb Chinook and Tom said “Wow that is nice one”. I just smiled and set the lines up again. Within the first 3 hours of his trip we boated 3 nice mature Chinooks. It was a great morning on the water and, we had a lot of fun. It just goes to show how many people, have no idea how good are salmon fishing is in Lake Ontario.  Here are a couple of pictures of tom   Tom with his first mature Chinook   Tom with another nice fish   Tom with his personal best 20+lb   Cheers AL www.alsadventures.ca"
