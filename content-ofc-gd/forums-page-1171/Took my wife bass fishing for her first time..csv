99710,DT10Sam,2007-08-01 02:54:00,480,"Hi everyone,  I really do not know what has gotten into me lately with all of this fishing stuff, and when Glen came in to work today I told him well the store is yours to run today and I am taking my wife Laurie out for her first outing at bass fishing.  Well it did take a couple of attempts for Laurie to be able to cast her line out and once she accomplished that it was time to target some largemouth bass. We went out on the Bay of Quinte for some bass fishing and I think that Laurie is now keen on bass fishing. I taught her how to texas rig some senko baits and then we also did some wacky rigging and before you knew it she was into some bass.  We tried some different baits as well as some Zoom frogs however the winners were Yamamoto senko worms.  We also tried some top water lures however today was not the day for to tease the bass with topwater baits.  Here is Laurie with her very first largemouth bass.   Here is Laurie's 2nd largemouth bass.   After we finished targeting largemouth bass I thought it would be nice to have her target some smallmouth bass and enjoy their fighting skills on light line. Laurie became a real pro in no time and here is Laurie with a couple of small mouth bass. She did get 4 in total.   Well that is it for today's outing.  On Sunday Glen and I will be hitting a private lake quite hard and I will be posting pics from that trip and then on Monday I will be taking Laurie out again targeting more bass.  This keeps up and I will have to charge her guiding fees  Best regards, Sam"

99785,cthewrld,2007-08-01 12:13:00,99,Excellent report.  You both must have been thrilled.  Having a live in fishing partner is amazing.
99786,DT10Sam,2007-08-01 12:15:00,480,"  I played guide all day (so that I can escape on Sunday to fish all day)  so I did not fish and the day was all Laurie's..........the real truth....... she would have out fished me.   Oh yea I just got reminded that she also got her first salmon last week..........what was I thinking....I'm creating a fishing monster.     Regards, Sam"
99793,scuro,2007-08-01 12:44:00,386,"At 46 I finally spent a week with my wife on a fly-in. We hadn't really fished before. That was a great trip. Finding a new common interest makes it feel like one is dating again. I look forward to fishing with my wife in two weeks....and yeah when it came to bringing the big fish to the boat and getting the best looks, she out fished me!"
99835,Joey,2007-08-01 15:23:00,9122,That's just great Sam.  Its great to fish with your partner in life.  The fringe benefits are very rewarding in more ways than one  Looks like Laurie's becoming a great new fisherman Joey
99841,Jen,2007-08-01 16:24:00,833,"There is absolutely nothing nicer than spending the day with the person you love on the water... and it looks like you put a smile on her face... way to go to both of you... Sam for putting in the effort and Laurie for being willing to give it a shot... NICE FISH GUYS>>>  Cheers,  Jen"
