The long walks through the bush, I have come to live for. Nature and life, at it,s best time of the year. FALL..  Getting the yummy candy ready.    Awe, look at temp. PERFECT.    My usual tag along was with me, as he is still loving the adventures of walking and fishing the pin. It does the body good.  We had a nice stretch of river to ourselves. That,s a bonus on this river. Conditions looked sweet. Little high and good vis. I thought we were going to crush them this morning. Unfortunately though, I was only able to land this little fella. None the less,it was nice to get that first one on the bank.    After a couple of hours we decided to hit another spot. Head back to the trucks and get on our way.  We get to our next drift and it was awesome to see this guy. He was playing with his pet steelie. LOL  Great to see you Mike. And always nice chatting about the fish that run this time of year, no matter the water way.     We seen this bird flying and diving. I thought an owl at first,then Mike said Osprey. Terry nailed it. It was a bird. All three of us had a good laugh.  Once it flew right in front of us,Mike noticed it was a cooper hawk. First one seen by me. Beautiful bird. Only had my small camera with me. Best pic I could get.     Cant wait for the real run to start. I got a full week in November coming up."

Mike : ""I'm pretty sure something just died over there..."" ***Hawk flies away  Great to run into you today. I'm sure we'll meet up sometime this fall"
