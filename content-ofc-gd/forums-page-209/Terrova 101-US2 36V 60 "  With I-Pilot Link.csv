877288,Moosebunk,2014-10-18 21:12:00,3970,TERROVA 101 Terry!?!?!  Serious KotaBalz dood!  
877298,Terry,2014-10-18 21:32:00,14456,TERROVA 101 with ilink yup time to retire the 80lb fortrex
877300,misfish,2014-10-18 21:34:00,29133,TERROVA 101 with ilink yup time to retire the 80lb fortrex  It will do fine on your toon.
877302,Terry,2014-10-18 21:36:00,14456,yeah the extra battery might be too much for the toon or you know it might just happen  lol
877366,AdamS,2014-10-19 16:06:00,161,Let me know how you like the terrova Terry. I've been debating the fortrex or terrova for a while now.
877377,Terry,2014-10-19 17:45:00,14456,I will most likely not get to use it till the spring  I have used both in the past and do prefer the  fortrex  when fishing docks or a tight area where you need quick exact control  cable is way better but you can't get ipilot/ilink with a cable steering electric like fortrex so I will be happy because of the extra  features on the terrova
877398,Rodwrap,2014-10-19 19:37:00,130,I have the 24V i pilot/link. The BEST $$ ever spent..especially since I fish alone most of the time. I couldn't run downriggers  without it...
877406,BFSC Kevin,2014-10-19 20:23:00,1351,"Terrova for me.  It's better for all around fishing.  But if you're focused more on just shallow water fishing and in tight covers,  I'd get a cable steer like fortex. However I do a bit of everything so the Terrova fits the bill nicely.  I had an absorbent amount of money or it was my career,  I'd have both the fortex AND the Terrova"
