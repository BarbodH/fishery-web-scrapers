876990,Dan668,2014-10-16 20:49:00,1120,Usually do ok for bass and pike.  Not one of my favourite lakes to fish but was invited up to a friends cottage here.  Is it worth bringing up musky gear?  Oh how i wish they were on the other side of the locks lol.
877005,BillM,2014-10-16 22:11:00,17367,"There are some muskie in there, I raised one well over 50in this spring on bass opener.  Just a monster, but they are few and far between."
877007,grimsbylander,2014-10-16 22:26:00,3016,I agree with Bill regarding the numbers. The few times I've seen them it's been the north end of the pool.
877009,Dan668,2014-10-16 22:37:00,1120,"Thanks guys.  Well ill bring the gear along, try a few casts.  Hopefully the bass will be on, didnt have to much success this year there except for in go home.. Weather looking pretty poor this weekend also."
877012,BillM,2014-10-16 22:41:00,17367,Some nice pike in GPool as well..
877062,skdds,2014-10-17 02:38:00,195,"Fished GP a number of times. Mostly summer-early fall, SM/LM-topwater, drop shot 15-25ft and senkos. Not sure about the presentations for this time of year. Small-medium pike are common along weeds/weedlines-used white spinnerbaits last summer. Once caught a good sized musky- by accident though! I mostly fish the east side- good structure and current there. Apparently there are walleye too but I've yet to catch them..skdds"
877067,BillM,2014-10-17 03:20:00,17367,"There's walleye, but they are even more scarce then the muskies are."
877086,solopaddler,2014-10-17 12:29:00,8605,"Not recent info, but I doubt much has changed. I crushed the pike at Gloucester using a white spinnerbait tipped with a small sucker minnow, just slow rolled over deep weeds. Also for whatever reason a 4"" blue grub just destroyed the smallmouth, it was almost like a magic lure."
877139,musky666,2014-10-17 22:24:00,126,Is there a decent public ramp anywhere on the Pool?
877144,Dan668,2014-10-17 22:40:00,1120,Just in severn. Drive through little lake and your in the pool.  Thanks for the tips. Ill report back sunday.  Looks like its going to be an awful weekend.
877164,skdds,2014-10-18 01:27:00,195,"1. There is a boat launch ($) at White Falls Marina. 2.In the spring/summer/early fall you can park and launch at big chute on the severn river for free and take the ""marine railroad"" (photo looking toward GP) down into GP. Lock fees depend on boat size ( I'm in a kayak..was $9).."
