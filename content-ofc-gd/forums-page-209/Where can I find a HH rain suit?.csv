I'm leaning towards the Potsdam Jacket and a set of bib overalls. I hit Gagnons, sail, Sport check, Marks, Canuck tire and Lebarons but no luck. Any ideas other than on line? Thanks"

I have since upgraded to the BPS 100mph suit. Best money I have ever spent and is leaps and bounds better than any other rain suite it have ever used. If the HH is all you can afford, go for it. It you are going to be outside a lot in the rain/wind and want something breathable, spend the extra money on something like the BPS suit. They are expensive (but there are more expensive options out there) but the are worth it in the long run as they are better built and last a long time.  Adam"
