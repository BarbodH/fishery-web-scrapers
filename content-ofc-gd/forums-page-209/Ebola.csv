877510,woodenboater,2014-10-20 17:04:00,2277,and this story explains how 2 countries dealt with the ebola crisis. we could learn a thing or two from how they handled it.  http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/world/ebola-how-to-stop-the-disease-dead-in-its-tracks/article21159394/#dashboard/follows/
877568,floater,2014-10-20 22:40:00,220,I work at one of the designated Hospitals where positive patients will be transfered too. As of last week we had no equipment to handle any of the specimans we get. Now that people are  speaking out the supplies are pouring in. When flu season hits I figure Health Care will be bankrupt in North America. They are making the same mistake they did with Sars. Anyone coming into Emerg with symptoms isn't sequestered right away. They need to put a second entrance into the Hospitals and have a screener at the doors to point you in the right direction but all this costs money so it isn't going to happen. Double gloves and gowns for me now at work.

876976,Mister G,2014-10-16 18:45:00,1429,"ebola can be spread through droplets(sneezing,coughing,drooling) which is a form of  airborne you do not be in direct contact but to inhale sputum,this is coming from the infectious disease control person at the hospital where I work. If you google it you will also find that out. Yes, there must be more to this then having body fluid come in contact with you because if you watch the news on TV these medical teams are in full blown hazmat suits. Never seen that when someone has the flue."

A 'hazmat' suit would mean working with something that is most likely extremely airborne and contact spread and possibly more virulent. Canadian healthcare workers (GlobalMedic for example) would most likely wear coveralls, face mask and face shield (for splatter protection). Hands and feet would be covered as well.  The nurses in Dallas probably got infected in the disrobing stage.  afaik, a hazmat suit would basically mean being hermetically sealed and taking a full shower to decontaminate in a contained environment before disrobing. It would also mean, imo, that  they're dealing with something far more riskier."

877073,DT10Sam,2014-10-17 04:13:00,480,"Hi Everyone, I haven't been on this site much as I am having to battle cancer at the present time, however on the issue of Ebola there will be many cases I would expect that will be reported in the Belleville area and the hospital is prepared to deal with them. This last case that was found to be negative is a welcome relief and the person that had it is a armed forces member returning to Canada. As we see more of our service men returning to Canada from the African area you will most likely see that they are taking all precautions and be admitted to the hospital if they have any sign or symptoms of ebola. Hope this clarifies some of the misconceptions as most of these armed forces personnel fly home on their own aircrafts and not necessarily charted flights.  Regards,Sam"

877149,Joey,2014-10-17 23:01:00,9122,"Watch the movie ""Contagion"" with Gwyneth Paltrow and Matt Damon. That'll sum it up in a nutshell should it hit America.!!!!"
877245,ch312,2014-10-18 18:03:00,1590,"Yes, there must be more to this then having body fluid come in contact with you because if you watch the news on TV these medical teams are in full blown hazmat suits. Never seen that when someone has the flue.  Catch the flu...odds are very good you'll survive Catch Ebola...odds are very good you'll die  As you can see below, Ebola can be spread by coughing and sneezing which is why those around infected people wear hazmat suits. Who in their right mind would approach an infected person when a simple sneeze from that person could result in you taking a dirt nap?   http://www.cdc.gov/vhf/ebola/transmission/qas.html Ebola has been detected in blood and many body fluids. Body fluids include saliva, mucus, vomit, feces, sweat, tears, breast milk, urine, and semen. Unlike respiratory illnesses like measles or chickenpox, which can be transmitted by virus particles that remain suspended in the air after an infected person coughs or sneezes, Ebola is transmitted by direct contact with body fluids of a person who has symptoms of Ebola disease. Although coughing and sneezing are not common symptoms of Ebola, if a symptomatic patient with Ebola coughs or sneezes on someone, and saliva or mucus come into contact with that personâ€™s eyes, nose or mouth, these fluids may transmit the disease."
877362,tb4me,2014-10-19 15:56:00,3295,"There seems to be much confusion on how it gets transmitted. Vomit and Diarrhea can also spread ebola VIA airborne particles, and those symptoms are normal with Ebola. My Sister is a nurse and has a special training seminar in regard to the transmission and spread of the disease. Its much more complicated then one would imagine, thats for sure"
877370,porkpie,2014-10-19 16:46:00,2521,"There is doubtless lots if confusion, and plenty of folks are terrified at the prospect of it being easily transmitable by air.  Let's put things in perspective.  This thing has been going since last December at the earliest undiagnosed, and since march with diagnosis and initial response and treatment.  I am not an epidemiologist or a virologist, but I am pretty sure if it where ""easily transmitable"" that all of Africa would be a disaster zone right now, along with a good portion of the rest of the world.  Let's all be thankful that so far it seems to be a virus that is harder to pass on, and let's hope it stays that way!"

877410,Spiel,2014-10-19 21:48:00,9065," Nature has a way of dealing with overpopulations...  This is indeed the way it works as history has proven time and time again, like or not the world is over populated."

876825,Roy,2014-10-15 14:33:00,13728,At least the diagnosed person in Belleville  was found to be negative.
876830,Mister G,2014-10-15 15:16:00,1429,Ebola is real and should be taken seriously. Flu shots are readily available and also should be taken seriously.
876833,Fisherman,2014-10-15 15:51:00,7201,Should put a complete travel ban to those infected countries.
876853,jimmer,2014-10-15 19:28:00,2730,"I agree with Fisherman. They (WHO) made such a big deal about sars, yet they let people travel in and out of those African Countries with a simple questionnaire. Ebola kills most, so hopefully the vaccine works."
876863,blaque,2014-10-15 20:53:00,2419,"doesnt take much to get my worrysome mind tripped,,,,and this ones got me goin for sure"
876872,porkpie,2014-10-15 21:56:00,2521,"It's a concern to be sure, and should be taken seriously.  Keep in mind though, that the countries where it has gained such a foothold, most people don't even have running water or soap to wash their hands.  Never mind advanced medical facilities and an ability to properly keep track of people.  Add in superstition, and belief in what amounts to witch doctors and a general mistrust of often corrupt government and we see the situation that is tragically unfolding.  In it's current form, I don't believe ebola will go very far in North America, and I hope I'm not wrong!   For the affected nations, I certainly hope that a vaccine is successful very soon!"
876875,Fisherman,2014-10-15 22:22:00,7201,"I don't believe ebola will go very far in North America, and I hope I'm not wrong! It will go as far as the next infected person and airplane take it.  That's already a fact."
876876,Steve,2014-10-15 22:41:00,2075,"it'll become a SUPER fear in North America if the nurse in the US who took the flight to and from Dayton, while infected, and very contagious, infects a number of people on the plane.  a closed plane environment is very bad."
876887,porkpie,2014-10-15 23:29:00,2521,"Time will tell, the only thing inevitable in life is death and taxes.  And in the end you can't cheat either!  One thing is for sure, something is going to kill me eventually.  Hopefully it's old age!"

One thing is for sure, something is going to kill me eventually. Hopefully it's old age! I'm not religious by any stretch, but I'll give you an Amen on that line."
876890,woodenboater,2014-10-16 00:19:00,2277,"According to everything I've read, ebola is a direct transmission infectious disease. there has to be direct contact with fluids. It's not an airborne transmitted disease, again according to those who know (fingers crossed).  As long as healthcare workers follow proper protocol, there should be no risk of ebola.  and if you want to scare yourself stupid, watch Contagion. VERY creepy movie and from what I've been told by first line healthcare workers who deal with infectious diseases in third world countries, it's very realistic. Very. If you're spooked now by ebola, this will make it worse."
876891,glen,2014-10-16 00:24:00,2641,"Nigeria also had some luck. Although the first patient, a businessman named Patrick Sawyer, was vomiting on his flight in, none of the roughly 200 others on the plane fell ill. Others did after helping him into a taxi to a hospital."
876892,glen,2014-10-16 00:29:00,2641,"Ebola can be controlled through hand-washing, and by using gloves and other barriers to prevent contact with infectious bodily fluids. Only direct contact with the body fluids of a person who is showing symptoms of Ebola spreads the disease. Ebola isn't airborne."
876900,Moosebunk,2014-10-16 01:08:00,3970,"   Not a nice bug at all that hopefully we will not have much contact with as Canadians here at home.  Any of our citizens over there helping in any way to fight against Ebola and aide to those infected and affected, are heroes.  A vaccine would be a much needed miracle about now for those at risk."
