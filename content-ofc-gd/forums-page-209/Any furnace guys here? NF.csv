877501,Raycaster,2014-10-20 16:01:00,528,"I have one last trip planned for LSC but the furnace seems to want to get in the way.  I have a older furnace that needs replacing but its just not in the cards right now. The furnace and AC are working fine but the damn blower/fan has been driving me crazy for a year or so.  The blower fan is the older variety with the motor on the outside belt driven. Well the bearings and shaft wobbled enough to wake the house so I went looking for a replacement. With Kijiji I was able to grab a used one which is fine but it was a little big and its causing problems also.  I just need a 15"" fan/blower as anything bigger won't fit properly. A newer fan/blower with the motor inside would probably be my best bet for quiet...  I've not been able to track down a assembly in the Hamilton area and hoping someone here has a line on a reasonably priced unit close by for pickup. I can install no problem as long as its the right size. I can pm exact measurement if anyone might have something.  Thanks ahead of time.  Really hoping to brave the cold and hit LSC in 2 week to chase the big boys but the furnace sounds like a bowling alley and the wife isn't happy if you know what I mean. "
877522,fish_fishburn,2014-10-20 18:50:00,1311,Maybe take the motor to a shop that rebuilds alternators and starters and have the bearings changed. I did that for a client once and I think the bearings were 40 bucks installed. Saved him from buying a new motor.

Any doubt, I strongly suggest you call a qualified service man, since your furnace is very old, you might as well get the heat exchanger checked, carbon monoxide leak is something serious and should be checked by a licensed technician.  Replacing it with another blower, you must replace it with same HP, RPM motor and a blower with the same CFM rating for proper airflow / heat transfer, or you can have other serious problems, specially during heating season."
