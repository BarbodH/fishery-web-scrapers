877438,Jon,2014-10-20 00:45:00,209,"I'm not sure if this one has an easy answer or not but I thought I would throw it out there and see what people think.  I recently saw a guy take a dead Chinook from a closed sanctuary. He tailed it with his bare hands, put it in a bag and took off. Now I have a bunch of questions starting with my most general, is this legal or not? The fish was dead when he ""caught"" it but he did not use a legal angling technique to capture the fish. The area was closed to fishing so no harvest was allowed but did he really harvest? What if he took 8 dead Chinooks home (over the legal limit of 6) - is that legal since the fish were already dead? Does someone need a fishing licence to catch and possess dead fish?  To me, this has a lot of nuances and I'm interested to hear what people's thoughts are.  Jon"
877439,glen,2014-10-20 00:56:00,2641,Illegal.
877440,FloatnFly,2014-10-20 01:00:00,1640,"that is illegal, most likely harvesting a female with eggs, keeping the eggs and ditching the carcass, the eggs count towards possession limit.  so not only was he 'fishing' in a closed section, he also used an illegal angling method"
877442,Terry,2014-10-20 01:14:00,14456,"interesting question  on the surface 100% illegal  however when dead fish   wash up to shore at your home or the local park no one would think of charging all the people who gather them up to dispose of them,  when Scugog  had the big fish die off the encouraged people to gather them up with no thoughts to limits or  seasons the intent may be different but the action is the same"
877449,FloatnFly,2014-10-20 01:44:00,1640,"i think those are 2 different situations, think the ministry would see that as the intent to purposely harvest, whereas the other were 1 encouraged by the ministry, and 2 property maintenance"
877450,Sinker,2014-10-20 01:55:00,8692,Who cares if a guy wants to take a dead fish? Does it really matter? Its dead. Dead is dead. I think our enforcement officers have better things to be concerned with....if you can find one.  S.
877457,craigdritchie,2014-10-20 02:45:00,1586,"Even if the fish is found dead, the guy will still need a valid fishing license to be in posession of it."
877459,Tootsie II,2014-10-20 02:59:00,162,"A friend of mine and a buddy were baiting for bear this August. The buddy found a large dead pickerel on shore near his cottage. He picked it up and used it to bait the bear bait site. Somehow the Ministry found out and the buddy got a visit from a CO. The CO only warned him not to do it again but made it very clear to him that it was illegal and next time a charge would be laid. I don't remember the exact provision under which the charge would be based but apparently it is clearly illegal even if the intent is only to clean it up to stop it from stinking. Apparently, you have to notify the Ministry and get permission first. "

877516,Jon,2014-10-20 17:57:00,209,"But don't these regulations all apply to the harvest of live fish, not dead fish? All the Acts that I can find (Federal Fisheries Act, Ontario Fishery Regulations) only speak about harvest of live fish using legal angling techniques. I can't see anywhere where they speak about harvesting or possessing dead fish. The Ontario Fishery Regulations state that ""no person shall, except as authorized under a licence, (a) fish"". Grabbing a dead fish by the tail is not fishing so it would seem to be legal?  A couple other questions came to mind when reading through the comments and regulations.  1. If you get a legally caught fish mounted, does that become part of your possession limit? If a licence is required to be in possession of a dead fish, would that not include the fish on the wall? 2. Trolling is defined as ""angling by trailing lures or bait behind a fishing vessel that is in constant forward motion"". Is back trolling then not considered trolling?  Jon"
877517,BillM,2014-10-20 17:59:00,17367,"It's still a sport fish in the regs, dead or not.   As for a mount?  No, that's not apart of your possession limit.  Back trolling is trolling..  Are you trolling right now with these questions?  lol"

877527,jimmer,2014-10-20 19:16:00,2730,How would he prove to the CO that he harvested dead fish and it wasn't alive when he grabbed it? There are no grey areas.
877528,John Bacon,2014-10-20 19:18:00,3277," Illegal disposal of a gamefish?  I dunno what else they could possibly charge him with.  Are you referring to the law about not allowing game fish to spoil?  I think that applies to legally angled fish that are suitable for human consumption.  Even if the fish is found dead, the guy will still need a valid fishing license to be in posession of it.  Actually, you do not need a license to possess fish.  E.g. It is perfectly legal for me to give a fish to another person even if they do not have a license.  However, any fish that I give away will count against my daily limit.  I am still not sure whether the original example is legal or not.  There may be a law, or interpretation of a law that covers that situation."

The burden of proof would be on the CO.  I brought a rainbow fillet home with me last weekend.  I cannot prove to the CO that it was legally caught in waters that were open using legal fishing methods while I was in possession of my fishing licence... but the CO cannot prove that it wasn't.

You shoulda seen the look on the wardens face when he looked in the back of the truck LOL.....luckily we had a reciept from the gas station where we caught the whities, or he was going to fine us and take the fish!
