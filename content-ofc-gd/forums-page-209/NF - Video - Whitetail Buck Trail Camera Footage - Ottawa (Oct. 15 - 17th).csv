This year I was given permission to roam privately leased NCC farm land here in Ottawa. In two weeks I have found 16 different bucks - and the action is just getting started.Here is some trail camera footage from Oct. 15 - 17th. Biggest buck I have found is an 11-point, but plenty of nice wide 8's around.  No hunting allowed on this land, so unless they stray far, these guys should be safe for the season.   (watch in 1080p HD for best quality)Cheers,  Justin"
