876913,BFSC Kevin,2014-10-16 03:34:00,1351,Well last month I had the opportunity to fish some new water and for a new species. I have never really targeted for carp before but this was a good chance for me to give it a go. Now bring on the chrome and Quinte gold!

You guys really captured the excitement of carping, especially the screaming bite alarm and bouncing rod tip( Crack for carp fishermen ..lol ).  Thank you.  Very enjoyable."
