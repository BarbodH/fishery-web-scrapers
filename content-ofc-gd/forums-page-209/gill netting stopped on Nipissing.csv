They will not be ""allowed"" to net until the May long weekend, which coincides with the summer season for recreational anglers. hen they are proposing to close it at the end of August. My guess is that within 5 years there will be no more commercial fishery on Nipissing."

Nipissing has always been a destination for me and my friends and the fisheries can be improved but it is the Canadians I need more than the fish.   Art
878055,floater,2014-10-23 22:07:00,220,wow and here I though Nipps Pickeral fishing had rebounded. We stopped fishing there for 10 years because of a lack of catching. Got back into it three years ago with Grumps ice huts and it's been very good to us for the past three years. Buddy landed a 9 lbr last year through the ice on 4 lb line! Can't wait for the ice.

Art Fishermen who travel great distances expect to catch fish or they would stay much closer to home and fish. If the limit is only 2 with a probability of going down to one it's a signal to fishermen the fishing at any said lake is not good and they look for more fruitful waters to have a fishing party/gathering/get together. This is not good for business along any lake shoreline.

This is not good for business along any lake shoreline. I'm not sure I can explain it to you but fishing is not only about what you catch but how you enjoy the time there. While at Nippising I have no problems catching all of the fish I want because I have fished it for 11 years with some of the most knowledgeable people on the board. If I had to make the choice of forgetting all that they have taught me about the lake or losing the memories of the fun and laughter we have shared. I will chose the fun and laughter every time. I travel 13 hours and pass some of the best waters Canada has to offer to fish with my friends and yes I would like for Nipissing to improve but it is far from the fished out place some want to paint it as.

I can't speak for all Americans, but for the 12 people in my family that venture to the Nipissing area for vacation, fishing is only a small part of the reason we go there. We've developed a great relationship with our hosts and the area itself is what brings us back. Sometimes I like to stream the radio stations from north bay just to reminisce. I'll go back as often as I can. Eyes or not!"

Chief Marianna Couchie confirmed Saturday a recent decision by the band council to close down gill netting on the lake until spring when the recreational walleye fishing season opens. She said the move comes after consultation with Nipissing First Nation community members, the vast majority of whom called for steps to curtail the use of nets on the lake. “Many people wanted us to close it right down,” said Couchie, noting the band council opted instead for a temporary closure out of concern for community members whose livelihoods depend on the fishery. She said gill netting is something that will be reviewed on an annual basis and that the long-term goal is to help find those who rely on the fishery alternative sources of income so they're no longer dependant or as dependant on the fishery. Gill netting typically begins following an annual moratorium during the spring spawn and continues throughout the fall and even into the winter months. Community consultations were called due to concerns about the health of the walleye fishery, with Nipissing First Nation indicating to its members during the summer this year's walleye harvest was expected to be greater than safe allowable estimates. That was after the Ministry of Natural Resources indicated in March the walleye fishery is in serious decline and is now only half of what it was in the 1980s, mainly due to the combined pressure of both the recreational and commercial fisheries. As a result the ministry did away with a slot size restriction aimed at preserving spawning walleye 40 to 60 centimetres in size and instead introduced a new minimum size limit to protect walleye up to 46 centimetres. The move was aimed at safeguarding young fish that have not yet had a chance to spawn. In addition, the already contentious issue of gill netting was exacerbated this summer by the discovery of more than a dozen abandoned and unmarked nets on the lake. Couchie said a total of about 200 community members attended the two consultation meetings that were organized by the band. She said one meeting was held strictly for gill netters. Couchie said gill netters aren't pleased with the closure, but she said the decision reflects the direction that the majority of community members called for. [email protected] "

877590,wormdunker,2014-10-20 23:57:00,1711,"I guess I'm wrong in my wording.   No I don't go fishing just to fill a stringer.  I love the great outdoors, fishing, hunting, riding the atv, & enjoying the scenery.  I also want to ensure there is fishing opportunities for future generations.   My main point is someone stated the recreational angler is responsible for the decline in the Nipissing fishery.  That is absurd!!    My other point which I should have described more clearly is that I can fish numerous other lakes with a possession limit of 4 walleye.  My wife does not fish - so if I keep 4 walleye in the 15-17"" range it provides the 2 of us with a nice dinner.    In the past 10 years I have released many fish so that others may enjoy the opportunities I have had.  I'll also add that I live near Lake Erie where the possession limit is 6 walleye with no size limit.  Please understand that I'm very disappointed to read of the decline of the great Nipissing fishery, since I first fished that lake in 1964."
877595,Nipfisher,2014-10-21 00:15:00,2449,"Mike Rousseau, you may not mind if your limit changed from 4 to 2. But you may have fewer clients wanting to spend money to catch fish that the CAN'T keep.

If peoples adaption in this case is to move to another lake to fill a stringer day in day out we have a problem. I watched posts on this topic before, and it brings out the worst sentiments lurking on this forum in my opinion.  I don't get how you are not going to have enough fish to satisfy you with 2. I can prepare 2x10inch walleye (and smaller) to feed 3 people.  I can see how this would upset people who are used to keeping 4 per day…I UNDERSTAND….but keeping 4 a day has been deemed unsustainable….. let the finger pointing begin….and around we go.  So…maybe a change in perception is what is needed. Maybe if people start to view a plate of fresh caught walleye as an absolute privilege and delicacy, and appreciate the fact that  even when only allowed 2 fish you are very lucky to experience the great outdoors and the feel of living off the land in an era when our natural resources are scarce and becoming scarcer.  In fact, take pride in  eating/keeping 2, know that you are helping preserve this wonderful experience for generations to come.  Probably get blasted for this….but thats the way I see it."
