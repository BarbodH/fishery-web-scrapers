Is there not a way for the site to automatically adjust the size of the photos like it does on facebook? I might be way out there but loading pictures onto facebook seems so easy compared to fishing forums. What's the difference? Why is there a size limit on this site?"
876973,BillM,2014-10-16 18:16:00,17367,"Because people will upload 10MB pictures without even knowing it, lol  Use Photobucket.. It's free and will auto resize for you."
877928,Entropy,2014-10-23 00:06:00,747,"yep, It is too much of a pain, thus no pics from me.  Got 100 to share after moose hunt, but don't have time to resize even one.  no loss I suppose."
877929,leaf4,2014-10-23 00:07:00,2466,"as bill said make a photo bucket account, upload picture and post the link into the thread bingo bango done"
