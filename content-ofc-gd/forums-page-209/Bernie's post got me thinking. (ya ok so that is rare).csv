877382,Big Cliff,2014-10-19 18:23:00,6899,"How many of the members here have made radical changes in their careers after they have raised their families?  I spent most of my working life in middle of senior management positions eventually starting my own company, In 2003, I sold my business thinking that retirement was the place for me.  Well, that lasted for about 6 months, all my friends were still working and I had never been without a job since I was 15 so now I fished, hunted, gardened, did what ever I wanted 7 days a week. That didn't work out so well, I would get up in the morning and had nothing to do, no one was counting on me, no one missed me when I didn't show up, I wasn't needed!  I got bored!  To be honest I started to become depressed, someone had always needed me or wanted me. I guess that's where I found my selfworth, now it seemed that if I didn't show up, no one cared. Not a good feeling for anyone, even worse when you are the one feeling that way.  I tried a bunch of different things; went back to school, worked at and got my license as a small engine technician, it was ok, I liked it but I didn't LOVE it.  Then one day as I was sitting reading the local paper I saw an ad for a truck driver. Nothing special, just driving pickup trucks doing what they called expidite runs. You could get called anytime to go wherever and pick up whatever and take it to wherever. The very next morning I applied and much to my amazement I got the job.  Oh it was a rough go at first, getting called at 10:00 pm to be in Brampton by 1:00 am to take a load to Tottenham, I never knew where I might havre to go from there. There were some nights that I just kind of shook my head but I did them anyway.  It has been a little over a year now, this has to be one of the best jobs I have ever had and it is without a doubt the best company I have ever worked for. They treat me like gold, in fact last week they asked me if I would be comfortable driving a 5 ton (I drove transport for years when I got out of the army LOL. A 5 ton is just a bigger sports car).  They leased one for a week just to make sure but after a few runs into TO at night in the rain with no issues, it looks like they are going to be buying it for me. So, after all the years of doing what I had to do to take care of my family, now at 68 years old I am finally doing what I love to do more than anything. I could and have been the president of corporations; I could and have been a licensed small engine technician; I could and have been a lot of things but I LOVE being a truck driver!  So, what about you?"
877384,leaf4,2014-10-19 18:32:00,2466,"Not me, but my dad will be in your shoes soon and to be honest I don't really see him actually retiring when he hits 65 like he talks about. he currently works for fallsview casino maintenance,makes good money and isn't really strenuous work, great for a 62 year old but if and when he retires, my mom will still be working 11 years till she's 65. so your point about not being counted on and having too much time on your hands essentially is what I'm thinking is going to happen to my dad, he likes to keep busy with side jobs being a licensed plumber, but why give up the benefits and all the perks he gets with the casino when he has 3 and 4 days off every other week due to his 12 hour shifts?  who knows, when 65 comes maybe he'll realize that he still needs something to do. Though I have been pushing the idea of a cottage and he's been mulling it over haha"
877386,Big Cliff,2014-10-19 18:48:00,6899,Good for you for having the foresight! We don't get old until we stop growing! At 68 I can't do as much as I did when I was 58 but I can still do a lot more than many that are only 48!

I have been employed every day since April 8 68. Love what I do, get asked all of the time when I'm going to give it up, I reply what for. I'm  one of very few that still respect the trade. I get asked by other ad agencies to look at their print work. Right now A major Japanese car company with a Luxury name plate is having me look at their 2015 dealer books. They have to look good. I love the work and get paid to do what I love.  Now when that big truck breaks you will know how to fix it lol"

Perhaps working part time  (veterinarian).  Perhaps some volunteer humanitarian work.  I would however, love  a life where if the weather was good,  I had the flexibility to take time off to fish or travel.  And work when the the weather is bad.  I have gone to 4 funerals lately of people younger than me.  Makes you think.  No one ever said on their death bed  ""I wished I worked more"""

While I value my time as a carpenter, It was time for a change...  I used my technical skills/training to apply for a position with the worlds largest manufacturer... after an exhaustive interview and testing process I landed the job I was applying for. A total carrer change @ 37 years old and I gotta say I should have done it much earlier, great company to work for who really value their employees, great benefits and constant challenges. I thrive in this environment.  great topic.  G"
877466,wormdunker,2014-10-20 08:07:00,1711,"All great stories from you guys.  I'd like to add mine.  On Bernie's other post I gave you some of the highlights of my employment as a crane operator in Fort McMurray.  I get asked often - ""when are you going to retire""??  I say to myself WHY?  I am healthy, I feel good, the wages are excellent, I have health benefits, & pension contributions paid by the company.  I love my job as an operator, the company treats me very well.  So I still do my 20 days of work, then off for 10 days.  I'm not sure what I would do with a lot of time off during retirement due to the fact I've always kept myself busy doing work around my home.  I know one thing for sure I'd definitely spend more time in our great outdoors.  As stated on many other posts here at OFC (when retired) you can now pick your days to go fishing, hunting, camping, whatever you enjoy doing.  When I do retire, I have plans for a few renovations at my home.  I now pray to be healthy first then my other plans will fall into place.  Good health to all us old farts!"
877473,crappieperchhunter,2014-10-20 11:54:00,2582,Good topic Cliff.  I'm 46 months out from retirement at 55. That has been the light at the end of the tunnel for me forever. However a few years back I had 2 surgeries in the fall and was off work for a total of just over 3 months. I was bored to death. I have been rethinking the freedom 55 ever since then.  Two years ago the company I work for restructured our holidays and we all got another 1/2 years worth of holidays for that year only...so I ended up with 8 weeks holidays that year. That was fantastic. Since then I have been thinking if I had 8 weeks off every year doing a job I actually like and working with people I enjoy working with...why in the hell would I ever retire? I mean I really don't need more then 8 weeks of free time a year. I am already financially in a position where if we are not busy I voluntarily take time off work unpaid... mostly to go fishing...so I plan on proposing to management that I would be willing to take 3 weeks off unpaid every year once I hit 55. In our current work environment it is a good fit and I am 100% confident that it will work out good for me and the company.  So this would not  be a career change but it would definitely be a different approach to remaining in the work force while gaining more free time to do other things as well. I know that this is not really in the vein of what you are experiencing Cliff...and I apologize if anyone feels that this is a hijack to Cliff's thread....but I thought it might offer food for thought for other people here who may be in a similar situation as mine.
877477,DanD,2014-10-20 12:10:00,2223,"I've been a licensed automotive tech (Mechanic) for 39 years; owning my own business for the last 33 years and still mostly love coming into work. Why I say mostly is that people can be very difficult to deal with, when they don't understand or care why somethings cost so much to have repaired these days. That being said I love the way this trade keeps changing up things; things that were the norm 5 years ago, isn't heard of today. It's a constant learning curve that sends me back to school 2 or 3 times a year. I've slowed down in the amount of work I can produce during the course of a day; but that's why I have two very knowledgeable young techs that can bust their ass for me. I am looking forward to retirement; but I'm not going to stop working on cars. I have a plan of building a ""hobby"" shop at home or moving to a place that has a shop. This will be my domain where I can work at my own pace, on what I want to work on.  Namely this old girl    Dan."
877487,Beans,2014-10-20 13:40:00,3339,Can't understand you guys...Retirement is the best job I ever had...  Mind you it would be a lot better if my health was better...  Don't get old...it hurts too much !

Well I shouldnt say it sucks. I enjoy the time with my kids, watching them play hockey, fishing etc. But there is just something in me where i feel best working hard and pushing through alot of sleepless nights, crap like that. I guess i just appreciate things more when im super busy. Ive mined, worked world class sawmills, welded in pipeline, earned my stripes in the oilfield, and most of it was great. Actually i hated welding where 80"" was a great day lol. Worked for awesome companies and some horrid. Currently im waiting to be called back to work with and im having fun with this company. Great crew, awesome supervisors, learning new skills with new equipment. Im only 35 so i got alot to learn. Ups and downs i spose. I hope one day ill find the perfect career. And where ive worked, that job is called ""hotshotting"" and its big money in alberta"
877542,jimmer,2014-10-20 20:01:00,2730,"I went back to school in the early 90's when I was in my thirties to change careers due to a severe back problem and self employment not working out the way I had hoped. I have worked in the Social Service Work field for over 20 years now and I want to retire. LOL I might have been better off taking an education in a different field, but that's the decision I made at the time. I had no problem finding employment at the time, but that is changing as I get older. The field has been good to me and it helped me pay off all of our debts including our mortgage, but I'm feeling I need a change again. I wouldn't have a problem with just my homestead needing me and my attention on a daily basis. I'm ready for the warmth of the south in the winter and there are so many lakes that I would like to fish before I'm gone from this earth. I have looked into going back to school to learn another profession, but something is holding me back; maybe it's the uncertainty or that my wife only works 3 days a week and we can't survive on her income alone. LOL"
877546,Big Cliff,2014-10-20 20:07:00,6899,"One suggestion jimmer, if you want to spend some winters down South, do it before you turn 65. Medical insurance for anyone over 65 is nuts especially if you have ANY health problems."
877578,Steve,2014-10-20 23:01:00,2075,"cliff, that must be a good feeling. to be retired but still loving life and learning.  my old man worked in a steel industry sub contracted electrical company for 33 years. They closed their doors during the last recession. its tough now. he now works for half the pay, works twice as hard, and has no end in sight. he should be planning for retirement, instead he's planning to work for 10 more years...at least.  I love to hear these positive retirement stories. i can't wait for dad to work because he wants to, not because he has to. A special feeling no doubt!"

I retired at 53 and for the last 14 years have never regretted packing it in early for even one minute. I do what I want, when I want and don't have to answer to a single person other than my wife.  We live a fabulous life in the country and life is great.  The old saying that once you retire you don't have enough hours in the day to do everything you want is absolutely true.  I've had too many friends and family die before they even had a chance to enjoy life and I have absolutely no intention of being one of them.  When your retired, every day is Saturday morning."

I don't know what that is yet.  I don't see myself stopping work altogether, just do something else other than the rat race.  Maybe I'll ride shotgun with you Cliff just to keep you company  Reminds me of Forest Gump when he cashed in his stock from the fruit company (Apple).  Lt. Dan told him he didn't have to worry about money no more.  That's good.  One less thing!  He decided to keep his current job and did it for free because he enjoyed it so much.  Cutting grass on a riding lawn mower for the University.  Can't wait to cut the grass on Saturday morning!"
