The springs themselves seem to be flattened and the loop is outside the mounting bracket. Meaning the loop itself isnt sitting on the bushing. The trailer is also riding really low. He had to keep the motor tipped up to drive it home as it was too close to the ground. After looking at it I noticed these issues. As well as, it seems the spring could be relocated to a lower hole on the mount creating a higher ride height.  So heres my question. Can the EL(Loop) style spring be replaced with an EE(eye) type spring on both ends?  I should have taken a picture of it while I was there.  Any comments and suggestions are welcome. Neither of us have done any trailer work before, so any insight will be greatly appreciated.  Ben."
877397,Sinker,2014-10-19 19:36:00,8692,"Are the springs mounted under the axle, or on top of the axle? If they are under, you can gain a couple inches of height by mounting them on top of the axle.....maybe.  Pics would definitely help.  S."

You can replace them with EE, however you would be required to to weld in the bracket for the rear shackle, maybe not designed for that or not enough room.  Need some pictures."

It has bushings and bolts at both ends, but it looks as though when the spring flattened off the loop end is no longer on the bushing but pushed out towards the rear of the trailer. Should the loop end fit tightly around the bolt/bushing or should there be a space.  Ill try to get him to send me a couple cell phone pics."
877427,Sinker,2014-10-19 23:33:00,8692,Mine is the same...and has been for the last 20 yrs....i thought u just wanted more height on the trailer.  S.
877602,Parnelly,2014-10-21 00:35:00,108,"Ok here's a picture of the loop end.    Should it be sticking out like that? Again, my trailer has EE style springs, and I have never seen this style before."
877623,Sinker,2014-10-21 01:38:00,8692,"Yeah, mine are pretty much the same.  S."
