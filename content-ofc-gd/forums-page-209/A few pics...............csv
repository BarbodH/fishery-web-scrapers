Fishing was excellent with about 15 or so lakers and about a dozen pike landed. Biggest laker was about 15#'s and the biggest pike (lost while netting) was in the mid 20's. The big laker had fresh teeth marks on it's mid section. The pics don't really do justice to the fish. Enjoy.         Hopefully the weather folks are wrong and the temps are much warmer than the -10 they are calling for next weekend."
