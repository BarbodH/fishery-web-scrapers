Willing to go as far as Kitchener/Cambridge east, and, London west.  Used to store my old boat at the DC where I work, but, the new boat's trailer axle measures about 7"" too long to fit up the ramp here.  Called one place that was supposedly $40 a month, when I spoke to him turns out he wants $300 for the ""rest of the season""...until May.  First of all I want it back out by April 1st latest, second of all how the heck does that work out to $40 a month...last time I checked that would be $50?!  Cheers, Frank"
878031,John,2014-10-23 19:42:00,2956,That is pretty good price for indoor storage
878033,Raf,2014-10-23 19:55:00,3495,That is pretty good price for indoor storage  indeed.  my place is $50/month but it's near arthur.  your best bet would be to look at the local paper or find a local farmer with unused barn space.
