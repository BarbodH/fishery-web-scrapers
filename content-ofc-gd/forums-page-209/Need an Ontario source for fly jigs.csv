877577,Christopheraaron,2014-10-20 22:59:00,3525,"The title pretty much explains it, I need fly jigs in 1/100oz (in bulk preferably) for a decent price. The only place around here I know sells them is BPS but I don't like to buy anything there and it's too expensive anyways. I'm also looking for 5/32"" gold brass tying beads in bulk packs.  Thanks, Chris"
877582,Christopheraaron,2014-10-20 23:09:00,3525,"I forgot to mention, they have to be within the GTA or nearby with fast and inexpensive shipping (someone like Luremaking.com)."
877594,Fang,2014-10-21 00:11:00,1330,There's a good source on eBay from Pennsylvania that sells 50 packs  The precision moulds are really expensive in this size so ultra small jigs will cost more. I was buying some 1/50 ounce from eBay with no problems and delivery in about 10 days. $7 USD plus about the same in shipping
877620,Christopheraaron,2014-10-21 01:34:00,3525,"Thanks, I get a little concerned ordering from the states. I need these things within about 3 days at most, anyone have an idea of what size brass bead equals 1/100oz?"

877957,Fang,2014-10-23 03:03:00,1330,Just saw some neat stuff on centerpinangling under steelhead flies/jigs
877981,cuzza,2014-10-23 13:07:00,467,"I've used Canadian Llama as well before for beads and the service is great but not sure they'll be with you by the weekend - http://www.canadianllama.com/  FWIW a 4mm sphere of brass is 1/100oz so to take into account the hole, you probably need 5mm or so which is 3/16"""
877985,Christopheraaron,2014-10-23 13:26:00,3525,"Thanks for the help guys, I ended up settling and am going with the standard jig head/bead/pin method."
878017,bare foot wader,2014-10-23 16:00:00,1354,"I kinda prefer the bed/pin method anyways, litlte more room on the shank to tie  not sure about local, but cabelas has micro jigs that I use for perch and trout jigs  tiemco makes great hooks too, i have some 45 degree jig hooks in size 14 but I would guess they make 90 degree too"
