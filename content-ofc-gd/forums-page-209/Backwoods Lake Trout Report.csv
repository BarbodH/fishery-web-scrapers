877064,4x4bassin,2014-10-17 02:55:00,1025,"It was that time of year when we head up to our favorite backwoods lake for some hot smallmouth and lake trout action . We usually go on the closing weekend for trout but my fishing partner had to work so we went the weekend before which was fine but a couple of the other guys had to cancel , no big deal more fish for us . This time of year we do a lot of jigging for lake trout but due to the cooler water temps. (59 F) we decided to do a little trolling as well and we did fairly well trolling weighted williams spoons but the majority of the trout came jigging . The smallmouth bass were elusive this weekend and not in there usual haunts , probably due to the late summer storm that hit us hard pretty well all weekend with ""start building the ark"" rain and a windy cold front !  This would be the last we would see of the sun for several days as it started to set   With the approaching bad weather we decided to gather as much dry wood as possible , which would be a little difficult with all the rain we had received this September but we went for a boat ride and gathered a whole wack of ""match stick"" dry drift wood along a windward shoreline . This stuff burns through anything !!!!   Here are a couple landscape pictures of the lake we were fishing     This is one of our hot spots for jigging lake trout , it is a small island with a little 10-15 ft shelf coming off it with a straight drop too 80 ft . It only produces in the early fall for some reason and when the trout are there they are in there thick right on top of the shelf .    We were lucky that it only rained during the day and stopped just long enough at dusk for us to cook up a nice meal every night and have a couple drinks and laughs around the fire      The trout were pretty active but not like in the past and the smallies were literally extinct , the bad weather definitely put these guys in a negative mood . Didn't get to many fish pictures due to the heavy rain during the day but we got a couple pictures in . The lake trout in this lake are all natural and mostly planktivorous so they don't grow big like Lake Simcoe greasers . These fish are orange finned beauties    This fish that my friend caught has a story to it that you won't believe , details to come  in another report   My bait of choice was a 3/4 ounce darter (homemade paint job) and a 5"" lunker city fin-s fluke in blue/silver/grey . A trailer hook was a must this weekend with the trout hitting short every time . I lost more fish then I caught even with a trailer hook .    Another year of wheeling into the backwoods is over and i'm already looking forward to my spring trip , its going to be a long winter .  I would also like to thank Mike Borger for the information on the tailing glove . I picked one up before this trip and it handled these little rockets great .  Hope you enjoyed , Cheers      "

877068,BillM,2014-10-17 03:22:00,17367,"Right on man!!  You get those 3/4 darters from Cabelas?  Great hooks on them, I gotta paint a few of them up with some eyes for next year!  I love those red finned beauties!"
877076,chris.brock,2014-10-17 05:41:00,4053,"Very cool trip and report. You take better pictures than I do.  Not to be a spoiler, but is your buddie's laker a little predictable, if you know what I mean?"
877084,solopaddler,2014-10-17 11:39:00,8605,"Nice report, glad you were able to find one of those gloves!"

877150,Ralph Field,2014-10-17 23:17:00,1018,Thanks for sharing !
877166,S.M.05,2014-10-18 01:37:00,145,Nice work on the lakers. Reminds me of a gem of a lake I fish spring or fall that has its own natural strain of smaller lakers in it.
877290,Moosebunk,2014-10-18 21:16:00,3970,Damn short biters!  And by the looks of the tail it got nibbled on purdy good too.  Great little short report.  Can't always bang 'em up but you did persevere through the less than ideal conditions.
877467,wormdunker,2014-10-20 08:25:00,1711,Nice report!  Thanx.  Your pix are awesome!  Nothing better than cooking fish on an open campfire.
877507,Tim Mills,2014-10-20 16:49:00,476,"Thanks for the report,  nice view overlooking your fire pit."
877867,4x4bassin,2014-10-22 16:45:00,1025,Thanks everyone for the comments . It is a beauty spot to say the least . Can't wait for next spring !
