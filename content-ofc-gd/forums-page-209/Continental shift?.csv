Should a stat fall on a B/C rotation we as A/D get a day off in lieu of their day off....and visa versa...  Hope this makes sense....  G
878231,crappieperchhunter,2014-10-25 04:00:00,2582,"Sounds like garbage really.  Flip-flopping days and nights on a weekly basis is not overly healthy, especially with quick turnarounds after your three nights on.  A great full-time shiftwork sched is, 2 days, 2 nights, 5 off, repeat... and somewhere over a 16 week course there will be one ""monkey"" shift.  That first half day sleep off of the night is perfect for getting chores and groceries done or, taking time with the family or fishing.   Trying a new schedule as well... 14 to 42 days on... 28 to 56 days off.  No repeat, just shuffle.   Sounds like garbage really.

You will see that whenever you work nights you have the next 7 days either on day shift or on days off, so you work your 2 nights and then your body is on days for an entire week. Then you work 3 nights and your body is on days for an entire week...etc etc. That is why it was hands down my favourite continental out of the 3 versions we worked. Every other weekend was a long weekend off..you never worked more then 3 days in a row and you had a full week to recover from the night shift. My company claimed they did a lot of research on continental shifts and this was the best one. We tried 3 different continentals and then we got to vote which one we went with. Out of 70 plus employees all but 3 voted for this version. That should give anybody a real good idea just how good this rotation is. If you gotta work shifts and or nights I think you would be hard pressed to work an easier rotation then this."

878080,skeeter99,2014-10-24 01:19:00,109,Only benefit I see so far is more time to fish.  ??????????????????????  you would get 13 weeks holidays plus whatever holiday u currently have????  this is the best continental shift (12 hr)  13 rotations in a 12 month period  4 days o 7 days off 4 nights 3 days off 3 days 1 day off 3 nights 3 days off  then the rotation starts over again  u only work 14 days a month u only use 44 hiours vacation to get 15 days off any days when u are (scheduled off)  on a stat holiday u get another day off in lieu of that day. depending on when the holidays fall on your shift u might get another 7 days off   there are lots of benefits to this

It is against provincial and feral law, guys at your work need to smarten up and look at what the provincial and federal regs are for modified work schedules (continental)  I will give u an example  a guy working monday to friday and x-mas falls on sat and boxing day on sunday 1. he would not go into work on monday and tuesday of the following week (he gets holiday off in lieu)  now u work shifts and your shift is not scheduled on xmas or boxing day (your days off that would be the same for the monday to friday guy)  1. u would get 2 days off (dictated by company or at your choice)  I have been working these shifts for 22 years now and if your employer is doing this to you guys u are owed alot of time off or back pay"

Right now I work 4 days on from 14:30 to 01:10 then 4 days off steady . Great shift but by that fourth day I'm starting to get a bit tired . The rotation of the days off are great , nothing better then heading up to the lake mid week for a couple days of fishing . Just to add to the above comment . I do not get days in lieu for working holidays either or do I get overtime . I work Christmas and it's just like any other day , been doing that for 25 years now . It's all about the contract you or the people before you vote on I guess ."

I like it, I work 14 days a month, days off during the week.... The only PIA Is The 1.5 days turn over from nights to days...  Black out your bedroom window to sleep during the day. I also find a small fan in the room helps to add ""white"" noise should the family be up and making noise while you are sleeping.. Picked up this tip from a member here when I first started.

878097,porkpie,2014-10-24 03:05:00,2521,"Shift work is where its at!  4 on 4 off, 24/7/365.  Every 4 days is a mini vacation.  Sure I work weekends, holidays, nights, you name it, and the shifts are long. But I get a ton of time off, and life is good. I don't shop saturday/sunday, I do everything that needs to be done during the week.  If your spouse is monday to friday, and not understanding then it can be a bear. If you have kids, and your wife, and by extension the kids don't understand that daddy worked all night friday, and needs to sleep saturday, then its a bugger of a time.  The strength of your relationship, and wether your partner sees the benifits of the shift work will make or break the whole deal.  Fortunately for me, my wife has never known anything but shift work in all the time we've been together.  I've seen new guys that have had a hell of a time with a monday to friday partner.  Some years you will work xmas and new years, some years you hit the lottery and have both off (if your work is 365, otherwise this doesn't apply of course).  I'm on a lottery year!! Good luck!"

878105,crappieperchhunter,2014-10-24 04:04:00,2582,I have worked 3 continental shifts. The best one is the exact one Gerritt has already outlined. You never work more then 3 shifts in a row except if you put in some OT. And every other weekend is a long weekend off.  We did a rotation for awhile that had you get 7 days off in a row every fourth week but the only full weekend you had off was the weekend that fell in the middle of your 7 days off. The other 3 weekends a month you either ended up working the weekend or having to work nights Friday which meant you got off work at 7AM Saturday morning. The week off once a month sounded great but it really sucked when I had 3 weekends a month messed up with young kids at home into sports.  Gerritt mentioned a fan and blacking out the windows to help you sleep during the day. Another tip... have as cold a shower as you can tolerate JUST before you go to bed. It will lower your core temperature a little bit. Your body does this naturally while you are sleeping so in effect you are tricking your body into thinking it is time to hit the hay. Also when you are heading home in the morning to go to bed wear the darkest sunglasses you can find for the drive home. The less bright sunshine  you have shining in your eyes just before bed the better you will sleep.  Our company got rid of the continental in 2004. We work 8 hours Mon-Fri now but I would go back to continental in a heart beat. I loved that shift and all the time off.
878107,pics,2014-10-24 04:21:00,1268,"Personal days? , N days, what are those?. We are allowed to take one week of our vacation as singles so a monday, Tuesday gives us a week.. the only problem with that is our vacation weeks start on Sunday and finish Saturday.. nothing like having to work the Saturday before you go away or the Sunday after you come back..it all depends how it falls into your schedule.. the 2 weeks around Christmas and new years come with the threat of an extra suspension if you don't have an approved doctors note.. not any old note will do.."
878109,Canuck2fan,2014-10-24 06:09:00,1444,"When I got out of high school I worked at a factory for the summer that had weekend continental shifts.  11PM Fri to 11AM Sat 11PM Sat to 11AM Fri  Next Week  11AM Sat to 11PM Sat 11AM Sun to 11PM Sun  You got 36hrs pay for working 24 hrs a week. People were almost shooting one another to try and get on that deal. You could also be a fill in for sick days during the week for other guys who worked on your machine....  The best part though according to guys who did it was you if you could find someone who would do straight nights or days to partner with you were allowed to just work days or nights. However if one of you ever missed the shift (without a doctor's note) you both got warnings, that counted as one of your 3 strikes."
878119,Andy,2014-10-24 11:18:00,330,"I work the same schedule as Gerritt. It wears me out, I seem tired all the time from the constant switching back and forth between days and nights. The benefit is every other weekend off. Like Gerritt says, the three nights followed by the Wed/Thurs days is the worst."
878133,dave524,2014-10-24 14:00:00,4508,"Worked them, found that after I turned 50 , 12 hours was a long grind. Another thing was that working 12 hours you don't have enough time to get a lot of smaller jobs , errands , chores done that you usually did before or after work when working 8 hour shifts, so you spent a chunk of your new found days off catching up on things that normally could be done during your work week. Getting off at 8 am on Friday and not having to be back till 8 am on Tues did make for a nice long weekend once a month."

Circadian rhythm is fickle, the idea  is to reduce tiredness by not having a set pattern.

878184,Fisherman,2014-10-24 21:37:00,7201,"Well, pretty much what Moosebunk said, shiftwork is not good for the body period..unless you're a Zombie or Vampire.  It can be done when you're young, much past the mid 30's and it really wreaks hell on the body.  You (your body) doesn't know when to relax, poop at the right time of day, is it sun up or sun down.  I worked different shifts from 18-51 and the last 7 years straight days with the odd afternoon shift.  Waaay better. Worked 9/6, 3 afternoons, 3 nights, 3 days( 8hr) and 6 off.  Worked 2 days, 2 nights(12 hrs) and 4 off. Then a wierd 2 afternoons, 2 days, and 2 nights(8 hr) short change(only 8 hrs off between the shift rotations.  Finally the 3days/2nights, off 5, 2 nights, 3days off 5 and 2days, 2 nights 4 off.  Off 2 weekends a month and work 2."
