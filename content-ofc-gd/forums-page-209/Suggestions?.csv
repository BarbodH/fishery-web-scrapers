I am not a seasoned fall angler. I was thinking Scugog, anyone fish it recently?- I don't care too much what is on the end of the line this time around!-probably drop shot, troll some minnows....other lake suggestions welcome from those fishing recently,  Thanks, Skdds"

878185,esoxansteel,2014-10-24 21:44:00,1307,"Otonabee is a good bet for sure, if you want less travel, put in at any of the river mouths emptying into L Ontario, troll Rapalas or spoons etc and hangon, browns and steelhead will be close by"
878188,skdds,2014-10-24 22:18:00,195,"Lake O...yep, caught a steelhead from shore two weeks ago at Erindale..  The only part of Otonabee I've been on was at the mouth of Rice lake..Any other good sections with a boat ramp? It goes from Peterborough to Rice correct?"
