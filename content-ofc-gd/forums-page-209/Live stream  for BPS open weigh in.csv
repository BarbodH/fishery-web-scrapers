877705,BillM,2014-10-21 14:56:00,17367, I am thinking that the weather was a big factor? Simcoe like Lake Erie can spoil you? 24 pounds of bass here in Ohio on any other lake besides Lake Erie is probably a lock on first.  Almost a 5 pound average? That is a pretty good deal almost anywhere?  I guessing it was for sure.  Just check out the winning limits from the previous 5 years.  I think the only year it was lower was last year.

877291,misfish,2014-10-18 21:18:00,29133,Theres been some great prefish reports.  I guess the weather played a big part. Some of the reports would of made me believe a 30+ bag would of won.
877292,Steve,2014-10-18 21:21:00,2075,Paul fishes and guides Erie....he can work that rough water like no ones business.  An Erie boy wins on Simcoe.  :clapping:
