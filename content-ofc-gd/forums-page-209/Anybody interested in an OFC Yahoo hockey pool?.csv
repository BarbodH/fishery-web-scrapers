875822,Stoty,2014-10-08 00:35:00,2910,I agree. I'm about to do the draft in my 6th. Lol
876555,LefroyFisherman,2014-10-13 22:24:00,602,  crazy... my slash lines from each team... the first one is the one we started and then dropped.  Is anyone still playing the OFC 2015 one?
876556,chris.brock,2014-10-13 22:48:00,4053,"I don't know what all those numbers represent, but Scott (Lefroy Fisherman) and me are still playing OFC 2015, I don't know if anyone else is actively playing, it's kind of funny how computer illiterate we are compared to the younger generation, Hahaha  edit- you are Scott, Hahaha"
876566,LefroyFisherman,2014-10-13 23:29:00,602,"I'm Shawn, those numbers are the stats across the top, all the totals... goals, assists, plus/minus, penalty minutes. Just stating my first team is a million times better then the second of course lol"
876647,tb4me,2014-10-14 16:35:00,3295,"whats with this? Note: Each week, your goaltenders must reach the minimum of 3 appearances. If you fail to reach this mark, you will lose all of your goaltending games for that week. This section will show you an updated total each morning. The numbers will appear red until you have reached the requirement.	I dont understand this..So my goalies have to appear in 5 more games or none of their points count?  Stupid yahoo rule "
876718,FloatnFly,2014-10-14 21:50:00,1640,"no, your goalies need to appear 3 times combined per week, yours appeared 6 times"
876755,tb4me,2014-10-15 00:38:00,3295,ok..Funny  don't remember this from last year's pool
876758,FloatnFly,2014-10-15 00:40:00,1640,must be a new change
876796,chris.brock,2014-10-15 07:32:00,4053,"I think that rule is in place because if the first night of the week, your 1 goalie playing throws up a shut-out, you could bench your goalies the rest of the week and have a GAA of 0, and a save percentage of 1000 at the end of the week  I was using that tactic a little last season"
876880,tb4me,2014-10-15 23:03:00,3295,"I think that rule is in place because if the first night of the week, your 1 goalie playing throws up a shut-out, you could bench your goalies the rest of the week and have a GAA of 0, and a save percentage of 1000 at the end of the week  I was using that tactic a little last season ha ha ha I never thought of doing that..Thats nasty...lol But I like it"
876885,misfish,2014-10-15 23:18:00,29133,Im lost. GO FIGURE.  TOLD YA. LMAO
877340,Joeytier,2014-10-19 12:51:00,3990,That's greeeeeeeasy
877428,FloatnFly,2014-10-19 23:39:00,1640,so heres a question......when does week 1 end? since its been over a week since the season started
877432,LefroyFisherman,2014-10-19 23:59:00,602,Today is the last day of week 1
877626,Stoty,2014-10-21 01:49:00,2910,"Hey guys, sorry on being distant!  Matchup dates - The dates of each matchup are listed under the ""Matchup"" tab but above your player lists. You'll see them in the black line. Since week 1 started half way through the week (Wednesday night), they just added it to the following week, so that the week 1 matchups werent based on just a few days.  Goalie rule - exactly that. It ensures that everyone's goalie stats are based on consistency, instead of just a game or two, then people benching them. Makes it a more even playing field. Same basis on the max 3 moves per week rule. I've had guys just dropping half their team after each night and picking up active players the next...and repeating. There's no skill in that."
875619,Stoty,2014-10-06 16:58:00,2910,"Yes, lots of room in the 2nd pool still."
875629,BucktownAngler,2014-10-06 19:11:00,582,"im in, and registered"
875630,tbaltovski,2014-10-06 19:34:00,38,"Since I already am doing it, I'm in."
875631,Stoty,2014-10-06 19:45:00,2910,"Just as an FYI, we have to have an even number of teams for the pool. We currently have 6. If there's anyone sitting on the fence, please join asap. I'll have to finalize the teams before 745 tonight in order for the draft to be a go."
875632,Stoty,2014-10-06 19:48:00,2910,7 teams now
875640,davey buoy,2014-10-06 21:37:00,5505,"7 teams now Stoty add me,Use the auto for me if you can.I'll be in and out if that works?."
875655,FloatnFly,2014-10-06 23:11:00,1640,almost time
875658,Stoty,2014-10-06 23:22:00,2910,"Looks like we have 8 teams. If anyone else wants in, you have about 8 mins to join, I'll then have to finalize the list to initiate the draft."
875659,FloatnFly,2014-10-06 23:33:00,1640,nice! second pick!
875681,tb4me,2014-10-07 02:13:00,3295,Missed the draft but love my team..Some how I managed to get Ovie..Sweet!

875685,tb4me,2014-10-07 02:22:00,3295,Mine is Go Leafs Go...

875692,steelhunter,2014-10-07 04:19:00,81,Couldn't be there for the draft but like my team Hope Sid can stay healthy Mine team name is only the losers
875694,tbaltovski,2014-10-07 05:01:00,38,I'm top shelf
875695,chris.brock,2014-10-07 07:15:00,4053,"after all that, I replied to the invite, assumed I was in the new pool, and went to work, for some reason I'm not in, Hahaha"
875699,davey buoy,2014-10-07 10:20:00,5505,"Chris I think Stoty can fix that?.I believe I'm dazzling dave but see no players?.Little new to this, do I have to hit auto pick?,or is something I'm missing?.Thanks,please help lol."
875700,LefroyFisherman,2014-10-07 10:28:00,602,I'm Pike Attack
875718,Stoty,2014-10-07 14:24:00,2910,There's nothing I can do to add people in. The teams were automatically finalized at 730 last night when the draft opened up.
875719,Stoty,2014-10-07 14:27:00,2910,"There's no Dave in the list of managers. Here are the first names of everyone that's in the pool: Christopher, Joel, Ronald, Jamie (me), Phil, Shawn, Jeff, Tony."
875720,chris.brock,2014-10-07 14:32:00,4053,"just like the Leafs, for me and Davey, there's always next season, Hahaha"
875721,Stoty,2014-10-07 14:44:00,2910,Lmao

875762,davey buoy,2014-10-07 20:20:00,5505,"Not sure what happened Chris,you were the guy that wanted to start it?,I had the invite well before timeout and I still didn't get in. lmao.I agree,as a leafs fan,always next year lolol."
875816,FloatnFly,2014-10-08 00:01:00,1640,"no reason why we can't do 2 separate pools, i''d join another one"
875532,Stoty,2014-10-06 00:33:00,2910,Ahhhh... I missed it!!! I had my son's 2st birthday party today and haven't been able to get on here until now! Crap!!!!!
875533,Stoty,2014-10-06 00:34:00,2910,As a side note... the computer randomly selects what the draft order it. I happened to get lucky last year.
875535,chris.brock,2014-10-06 00:38:00,4053,"Stoty, can Joel join late and pick from the scraps?"
875536,Stoty,2014-10-06 00:42:00,2910,"Unfortunately not... once the draft order is set 30mins prior to the draft, that is final."
875538,FloatnFly,2014-10-06 00:45:00,1640,grrrrrrrr
875539,tb4me,2014-10-06 00:48:00,3295,I couldnt get in either..Still cant I get The league is not in pre-draft mode. Can anyone help?

875542,Stoty,2014-10-06 00:54:00,2910,Has the draft taken place?
875543,FloatnFly,2014-10-06 00:56:00,1640,"yes, was set for 730pm est"
875547,chris.brock,2014-10-06 01:03:00,4053,"PM sent to Stoty, see what he can do"
875548,Stoty,2014-10-06 01:14:00,2910,"Chris mentioned... ditching that pool and starting a new one, to ensure everyone gets in. Would you all be down for that?  I'll ""renew"" last year's pool, so its all the same settings, then send the invites to everyone who wants in.  Thoughts?"
875550,Stoty,2014-10-06 01:18:00,2910,"I've renewed the league.... Please PM me your email address if you want in.  How would everyone be with a draft tomorrow night (Monday, Oct 6 @ 8pm)?"

875591,Stoty,2014-10-06 13:23:00,2910,Sorry Lefroy...I totally understand the frustration. Chris just felt bad because not everyone that wanted into the pool was able to join so before the season started he tought starting a new one with the rest of the ppl that wanted in was the best bet.
875592,FloatnFly,2014-10-06 13:51:00,1640,"just as a side note, sportsnet has a free pool going, chance to win $1,000,000 or a VIP trip for 2 to a game"

875296,chris.brock,2014-10-04 00:39:00,4053,"Jamie hasn't been around lately, I know he's got a young family, he ran it last year  If you like NHL hockey, and have 10 minutes of free time per day, it's fun, I really enjoyed it last season  if there's a younger, more computer literate guy who would like to get it going, that would be ideal  anybody interested? the regular season is near.....
