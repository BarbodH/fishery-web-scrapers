877179,limeyangler,2014-10-18 08:21:00,5204,"Hi all,  Heading back to Antigua in January. Will only be fishing a couple of spots that i'm familiar with. Both shore venues, both very rocky (sharp coral too). The winds are very strong that time of year so need to be able to fire fairly light clacking raps at least 50yrds.  There are some MASSIVE fish that will hit the clacking raps, lost both my lures to successive fish last time I was there, snapped me off like a knife through butter using #30 braid. I was using wire leaders.  I'm pretty confident an extra 20# test strength with the drag set right should see me through, as long as the braid i'm using can withstand the rock and coral.  Could go the mono route but then line diameter and casting becomes an issue I would think. My goal is to stay as light as possible while actually being able to land a big one.   Was thinking of trying a baitcasting reel with heavy braid. Baitcast virgin here.  I'm a southpaw so need a left hand reel...Abu Garcia Black Max perhaps?   Any thoughts?"
877180,spincast,2014-10-18 10:24:00,3279,"sounds like maybe 10 - 15 foot of heavy flouro leader maybe the way to go? If you're new to baitcasters, start practicing now, though. I am finally starting to be able to have outings without the birds nesting in my reel every third or fourth cast - and when you are reaching for distance in the wind - well that's when I spend the most time asking why I ever thought one of these darn snarlfing confounded, aggravatin' things would be worth learning.  Sounds like an awesome get away in the deeps of winter - and its on my bucket list for big water sport fish too - look forward to the report"
877181,singingdog,2014-10-18 10:51:00,1047,"You will get more distance with a big spool spinning reel, especially if you are new to baitcasters."
877182,davey buoy,2014-10-18 11:38:00,5505,"Agreed,big spinning reel for sure.Casting into the wind with a baitcaster is never easy even for the experienced bait caster fisherman."
877183,dave524,2014-10-18 11:39:00,4508,"You will get more distance with a big spool spinning reel, especially if you are new to baitcasters.  X2           high winds + light baits + baitcaster + newby = recipe for disaster or a lot of frustration"
877189,Sinker,2014-10-18 13:50:00,8692,"Yep, bigger size spinning reel, 50lb braid, with a good fluoro leader.  S."
877194,BillM,2014-10-18 14:14:00,17367,"50lb braid and light baits?  That's going to be a lot of fun, lol.  15-20lb Fireline, a good flouro lead and go have fun.  Sure you'll bust some fish off but it doesn't matter if you're running 100lb braid, coral will rip that to shreds as well."
877198,jeffw,2014-10-18 14:18:00,267,I have used berkley big game when saltwater fishing. It has excellent abrasion resistance and good shock tippet.
877211,Sharkbait22,2014-10-18 15:56:00,297,Checkout http://www.pechesud.com/en/ good advice and gear.  You likely want a large spinning reel e.g. 6500.
877216,Sinker,2014-10-18 16:19:00,8692,50lb braid is only 12lb mono diameter.....casts no problem with a clackin rap on a spinning reel.  15-20lb fireline is done just reeling in the clacking rap in rocks and coral with toothy fish.......without the fish.  S.
877274,limeyangler,2014-10-18 20:24:00,5204,"Thanks for the input guys. Will stay clear of the bait caster, good advice. I think i will continue to use my Shimano Baitrunner reel with a spool of 50-60lb braid and a spool of thicker mono."
877318,Joeytier,2014-10-19 00:43:00,3990,Why not run a steel leader?  I dont imagine those big predators are at all leader shy
877327,limeyangler,2014-10-19 02:46:00,5204,"Why not run a steel leader? I dont imagine those big predators are at all leader shy Run a wire leader, absolute must with the shark and barracuda present."

And the longer bait seems to help keep leaders out of the teeth.Cudas cut through 100lb floro like nothing, I started using the tufline wire lead material "

There are lots of white tip reef sharks about, last year a guy caught ( and killed….not good) a baby thresher shark. I did not have much luck at all…..but have a better idea of what lures to use. I will have a few top waters in my arsenal but the waves and swells (unto 6 feet high) made that method next to impossible. I could find some sheltered spots but with time limited and socializing to do I am kind of stuck on the windward side of the island."
