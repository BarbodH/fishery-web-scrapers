877543,Sinker,2014-10-20 20:03:00,8692,Hahaha....thats funny....sorry! You'll get there sooner or later!!  S.
877544,jimmer,2014-10-20 20:04:00,2730,I love the look of the muskie from that lake if I'm guessing correctly. Their bar pattern is so much nicer.
877553,Sinker,2014-10-20 20:29:00,8692,"Yep, they are nice clean fish for sure out of there. I assume your thinking scugog? Definitely different than the rest of the kawartha's.  S."
877248,Sinker,2014-10-18 18:23:00,8692,"FINALLY got my son hooked into a good musky. Its taken what seems like forever, but last night it finally happened. It was a nasty, windy, rough evening on the water, so we just stuck to trolling. We were doing 3mph along a deep weed edge when the rod with the Handlebarz blazing walleye went berzerk. He could hardly get it out of the holder, but he got 'er done! The fish slipped out of my hand while trying to get a measurement, but it was 40"" for sure........the young lad just wanted a number to brag about. Great fish for him, took him for a good ride, and had smiles all around!  "
877249,davey buoy,2014-10-18 18:26:00,5505,"Nice going,I'm sure he'll remember that one for a long while!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
877254,spincast,2014-10-18 19:06:00,3279,right on! Congrats to the lad (and the Dad) - that's a beaut

877287,limeyangler,2014-10-18 21:10:00,5204,Great Job boys!
877305,Whopper,2014-10-18 22:34:00,2174,"Awesome. A proud dad and a happy son, can't beat it!"
877311,solopaddler,2014-10-18 23:44:00,8605,"Awesome, love it!"
877319,Handlebarz,2014-10-19 00:59:00,3790,Totally awesome it's great to share the boat with father and son and a great PB is icing on the cake. Glad to know handlebarz played a small part in his day. Thanks for sharing with us all.
877320,Fisherpete,2014-10-19 01:07:00,1814,"Beauty!!! Looks bigger than a 40"" for sure... I would guess 43-44"". Good to know they are still hitting blades... I'm guessing the water temps were in the low 50's?"
877321,Sinker,2014-10-19 01:36:00,8692,"Mike, we've done well with your spinners. I also like the fact that they hold up to multiple fish!  Pete, water was high 50's.  I lost a real doozy right at the net on the same set up, same area, on the next pass going the opposite direction. What a heartbreaker. I truly believe it would have been a new PB weight for me in the kawarthas. Boy, did I ever hear it when it came off lol....  I dont usually fish when its hunting season, but he's has the musky bug going baaaad, so I think we'll be going a few more times in the near future  S."
877322,manitoubass2,2014-10-19 01:57:00,11391,Wicked fish for the youngin!!!! Congrats to him!
877323,Jigger,2014-10-19 02:17:00,1237,"Nice going man! Not a bad thing at all to have your boy want to get out in weather like that! Congrats to your boy, bet you are going to hear about that one for sometime to come."
877326,Handlebarz,2014-10-19 02:30:00,3790,That is great I am very happy to hear that they are producing for you.  As for using spinners in the fall yes they are great right through the 40 degree water temps and can be the key when fishing areas that most others are chucking big rubber.
877331,misfish,2014-10-19 09:27:00,29133,Congrats to ducky.
877332,moxie,2014-10-19 10:44:00,1566,Kudos to the young lad on the fish and braving the fall chop.
877333,Rich Clemens,2014-10-19 11:12:00,3131,Yeah.  I'd give him a couple more inches on that one.   Really nice fish and congrats and let the young man brag.  He deserves it.
