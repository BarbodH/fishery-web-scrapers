877827,Terry,2014-10-22 09:35:00,14456,the big girls must be coming in now  might need to get back down there
875649,Terry,2014-10-06 22:24:00,14456,"Every year we go with Lloyd, U and Me Guide Service in late November to catch those big fall Quinte walleye. Then we help him  pack  up the boat for the winter.Lloyds website http://www.bayofquintewalleyefishing.com/ Well Lloyd calls and says what do you think about doing the first trip of the fall walleye instead of the last trip.Lets see, warm temperatures ,no snow and no floater suits. Might be nice to fish Quinte in nice weather.Wayne was up for it too, so away we go.They  were calling for rain and 30km winds and the weather man was right for once.Lloyd said no problem we can always find fishable water.the first day we got 27 walleye with many double headerssecond day we got 19 walleyeon Sunday the wind came up quickly and it was a bit of a roller coaster ride, so after 4 fish we decided to call it a day as always we laughed and joked and had a great time and fantastic fishing, a little early for the big girls to show up. but lots of fish to keep people happy.                       "

875715,Headhunter,2014-10-07 13:56:00,5703,"Nice going guys! If the fishing gods put those kind of numbers, together with the fall brutes, it's gonna be a great season! All those smaller fish are a good sign for year classes to come! HH"
875726,Terry,2014-10-07 15:30:00,14456,We caught some even smaller. So we should have good fishing for some years to come
875729,misfish,2014-10-07 15:53:00,29133,Atleast you caught fish. LOL  Nice.
875744,mike rousseau,2014-10-07 17:39:00,4661,Looks like a blast....  Nothing wrong with pounding numbers sometimes in place of size...
875828,fishnsled,2014-10-08 01:18:00,3520,I can't believe you lost 9 fish!!!!       What a weekend for numbers!!  Congrats and thanks for the report!   Nicely done!

875978,Moosebunk,2014-10-09 02:07:00,3970,"White's alright on ya Wayne.  I'd skip the fishing altogether, not reel in anything at all, if you'd have me aboard one of these times.  Looked like fun!!!"
876013,Terry,2014-10-09 12:07:00,14456,"Yeah, get in line lol  It would be great if you could come on one of our fun runs."
876019,Fish Farmer,2014-10-09 12:51:00,2234,"Thanks for posting Terry, Were heading down for 3 days starting the 27th. I was sitting Jim Bowlby from the fisheries at Glenora the other day and told me that the Walleye fishing this year will be great from all their fish research and studies. I Was talking to Italo at a meeting and he has had great reports of great catches in Long Reach. So with that, we should put a few in the boat with 3 trips planned."
876174,Terry,2014-10-10 21:11:00,14456,guess I should get down to fish it a couple of more times this year
876179,misfish,2014-10-10 21:37:00,29133,guess I should get down to fish it a couple of more times this year   No time for that. Steelhead to be had.
