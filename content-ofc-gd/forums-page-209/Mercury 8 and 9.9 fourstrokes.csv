876989,Joeytier,2014-10-16 20:44:00,3990,"I'll be shopping for a new 12 foot boat/motor/trailer package next spring.  Given that most packages are equipped with mercury outboards, I did a little bit of research.  One major knock on these motors seems to be very small carb clearances, making them very prone to carb issues, but I can deal with this (stabil and hi-test should help with these).  Just wondering if anyone on here has any experience with these motors and can chime in with any input?  Not seeking input from the Yamaha peanut gallery, as I'm already well aware"
876992,Cosmos,2014-10-16 21:09:00,588,"Joeytier, it will make more sense to buy boat right now - much cheaper. in spring prices will go up again. I had 9.9 Merc and didn't have any issues with carb."
876996,Joeytier,2014-10-16 21:28:00,3990,"Won't be in the cards until Spring unfortunately, but yes now is definitely the time for deals!"
876998,Cosmos,2014-10-16 21:35:00,588,"Forgot to say I had it for almost 2 years, now my friend owns it - it's being another 2 years. Had carb cleanup done once I bought it back in 2009."

877031,Joeytier,2014-10-17 00:14:00,3990,"Those WC-12's are fantastic little boats...love the split bench in the rear.  But they are the heaviest 12 footer on the market, and likely worth more than I'm willing to spend.  Powersports in North Bay has a nice Starcraft SL-12 on a trailer with a 9.9 merc"
877033,4x4bassin,2014-10-17 00:25:00,1025,I have an older merc. 8.0 hp (97 I believe) and that thing has literally been to hell and back with no problems . It has even been at the bottom of a lake twice ( don't ask ) I had a problem a couple years ago with it starting but it was the line/pick up that was the problem I think . The 8.0 is good but my next backwoods outboard will be a 9.9
877036,Joeytier,2014-10-17 00:29:00,3990,Yeah the big heavy 4 stroke wont be a speed demon by any means compared to older 2 strokes!
877037,porkpie,2014-10-17 00:39:00,2521,"Any reason for a 12?  A light 14 will give you more space, and is just as easy to muscle off a trailer at a very shallow launch, or beach launch etc.  I could see it if you wanted to toss it in a pickup, but if your going to trailer anyway, the 14 makes more sense, and won't be a lot more scratch.  Starcraft makes an excellent boat, I love mine!  I had an early 80's merc 9.8.  It quit for good in 2007.  25 plus years isn't bad, but not great either.  The engine was never abused, and well maintained.  I'm a Yamaha owner now.  I won't say anything LOL!"

877045,captpierre,2014-10-17 01:09:00,2521,I agree with the 14 ft.  safer and more practical
877054,Joeytier,2014-10-17 01:47:00,3990,"I prefer being able to trailer, but I also need cartopping capabilities.  I don't fish big water and many lakes I like don't even have boat launches, so being able to comfortably pull behind a fourwheeler is a factor for me as well."

877155,ecmilley,2014-10-18 00:11:00,2163,The 8 and 9.9 were the same weight in 2003 113 lbs little porkers. Had the.mercn9.9 4st on a 12 ft sea nyph the sucker would fly do 24 mph but didnt troll slower than 1.3
877236,Joeytier,2014-10-18 17:35:00,3990,I think the 8 hp would be a nice fit then.  I'm not too concerned with speed but being able to plane out with 2 guys + gear would be great
877296,porkpie,2014-10-18 21:30:00,2521,"If the 8 and the 9.9 are the same weight, take the 9.9 every time.  If you want a light engine, and don't mind used, look for a Nissan 9.8 2 stroke.  They weigh in the neighbourhood of 60lbs."
877344,craigdritchie,2014-10-19 14:02:00,1586,"If you're looking to save a few bucks buy a Tohatsu outboard. They're identical to the Merc (Tohatsu makes small outboards for Merc, including both the 8 and 9.9 hp models) and may be a bit less expensive. That said, there are a lot more Merc dealers out there.  Totally agree with Porkpie - between the two I would take the 9.9 over the 8 every time. They're the exact same engine ... the 8 hp is simply de-tuned down to 8 hp.  The 2014 model year 9.9 is 84 pounds. Merc also offers a ""Bigfoot"" 9.9 with a larger gearcase and four-blade prop. It's heavier (96 pounds) but gives more grunt if you'll often have heavier loads in the boat."
877346,Joeytier,2014-10-19 14:14:00,3990,Thanks for the input.  Do you think I'd be sacrificing a bit of trollability going up to a 9.9 on a such a small boat?  I do a lot of trolling and would like to maintain speeds 1.0 - 1.2 if I can.  That is my only reason for considering the 8 over the 9.9.  I knew the Merc's were a Tohatsu platform but I've yet to compare pricepoints on the two.
877348,ecmilley,2014-10-19 14:19:00,2163,you may need a trolling plate on 9.9 mine didnt get under 1.3mph with one guy i used to throw out a small drift sock not the best thing for control and turns but it worked. also was a yamaha powered merc if that makes any difference

877385,craigdritchie,2014-10-19 18:40:00,1586,"In a small boat I almost always prefer to backtroll, just to have greater control, so low speed has never been an issue."
