This thing is heavy to pull by myself. Anyhow, don't mind giving it to someone who can use it... for free.You'll need to pick it up.Feel free to PM with questions.  Cheers, Ice Fisherman"

877587,tb4me,2014-10-20 23:35:00,3295,Where are you? Id be very interested!
877628,GBW,2014-10-21 01:53:00,8460,If it's bigger than my portable I'll trade you and you can either give someone else my Clam 2000 for free or keep it.  I'm in Lindsay if that works for you.  If yours is heavier than a Clam 2000 but the Clam works for you then maybe a swap so you still have a hut for when you can use it?
