877656,bawbag,2014-10-21 04:47:00,48,Caught this fish trolling the Thames river Saturday. All the time I've put in chasing these fish finally paid off. Fish measured 48 inches personal best for me by far. I wish now I had taken a girth measurement to get a rough estimate of weight but releasing the fish was the only thing on my mind after a quick picture.
