We were staying in hotels and eating in restaurants. To make a long story short, as we were walking down Young St., a young lady asked me for some change and I dug deep and gave her all the change in my pocket. It was probably about 5 or 6 dollars and mostly quarters and a few loonies. She threw it on the street and started cursing at me. My wife had never heard me use the language that I shouted back at the girl. To this day I will not help a beggar. Pity the fool squeegee kid who leans over my truck with his chains to wash my windows. P.S. My son made a full recovery after about 3 months and is fine now.

He showed me his finger,wounded by medicine gauze,said he had no money to go into the pharmacy in the plaza to get some medicine for his injured finger, it was cold in winter ,early February, and i gave all cash i had in my wallet  maybe 10-15 bucks.that was the first time i met such kind of things in Canada. OK then 7 months later. that is about 1 month ago, when i was parking in the same plaza, someone knocked my window. i saw him again,I'm not 100% sure but i am quite certain about it. he told me the same story.And i said,does it really take you nearly a year to heal your finger? he looks a little puzzled ,and i told him i met him right here in February.

Ten minutes later I went into the liquor store and there he was, counting out a pile of dimes and quarters to pay for his bottle. Passed him again the next day and when he asked for ""80 cents for a coffee"" I said ""sorry, buddy, no change"". As I walked away awy he screamed ""F*&$ you, you F*&$er"".

Obviously they are looking for handouts and I got to wondering; would they work if they could?  The other day as I was pulling off the highway I saw one of these people, I had just stopped at a coffee shop and bought a coffee and apple fritter, he looked hungry so as I pulled along side of him I handed him the bag with the apple fritter in it, I had to keep moving, there were cars behind me but as I looked in my mirror I saw him throwing the bag at the back of my truck.  There was nothing wrong with the fritter, I hadn't taken a bite out of it or anything but he threw it back at me. My first thought was ""well tomorrow I'll try tossing you a cup of steaming hot coffee"" but then I cooled down a bit and wondered if I just didn't understand.  As I was driving I started thinking about what I would do if I or my family were homeless, and hungry. Would I stand at the side of the road asking others to give me money? Well, I guess I might if I had no other choice but I am way too proud to ask others to give me anything other than an opportunity.  I remembered back to the late 60's when I lived in French River and worked for INCO. We went on strike (not my choice) and the strike lasted about 3 months. My strike pay was $11.00 a week, I had a wife and two kids and no money in the bank. Every two weeks I would hitchhike from French River to Sudbury, get my check, go and buy groceries (a lot of KD, it was only $0.11 a box back then), and hitchhike back to FR. (Had to walk it a few times that was back in the day when there was a prison farm at Espanola and big signs ""DON'T PICK UP HITCH HIKERS"".  We ate KD and fish/grouse/ (and anything else I could catch/kill) and we survived. Our landlady was kind enough to let us defer our rent until I got back to work (of coarse with intrest) and I changed the oil stove to a wood stove, we used candles and lanterns (couldn't pay the hydro), but we didn't ask anyone to give us anything (well I guess hitchiking is asking someone to give you a ride).  Do these people really need to be out there asking for donations? Don't we have systems and resourses in place to deal with things like this? I know that every year Sue and I donate what we can afford to food banks, the Unitedway and a few other charities but this is Canada after all. We donate millions if not billions of our tax dollars to other countries, are we doing this at the expense of our own people? If so, why?     The prison Farm was at ""Burwash"" about 20 km south of Sudbury and Espanola is about 50km west of sudbury of Hwy 17.  Espanola has NEVER had a prison.  As for the homeless. when I lived in Scarborough we had a couple of 'local' homeless people. They realy have mental health issues and are heavy alcohol and/or drug users. They are expert con artists. We had one guy named""Wayne"" that used to work on Bay street until he literately snapped. His family lives in a posh house in West Hill and he won't have anything to do with them. Wayne would have a nice scam every Christmas season. First he would take his shoes off and stand by the local variety store looting unkempt and disoriented. Every time a customer would walk to the entrance Wayne would intercept the 'mark' by slowly and deliberately taking his hands out of his coat pocket where a very old crumpled 5 dollar bill would fall at the marks's feet. Wayne would pretend he didn't notice and he would thank the mark for the donation( ha ha). A few minutes later the mark would exit the store and hand Wayne some money. Once the mark was far enough away Wayne reached into the other pocket and pulled out a huge wad of money and added this to his donation.  I was in a parked car near all this watching as I waited for a friend to finish her shopping. I watched Wayne score every time. He must have made $200 in less than 30 minutes. Each morning Wayne would walk down the middle of Kingston Rd to get to the LCBO when it opened.  My Nephew goes to U of T and is paying his own way the best he can  by doing virtually and summer job(s) he can get.  Last year he shared an apartment with 3 other students. They were regular 'homeless' young guys that worked the downtown core in the summer and weekend during the year when they needed money to party.  My nephew moved out as these guys did a lot of shay things but he told me that they even had there begging clothes in garbage bags because it stank so bad. These guys managed to to afford a car and nice clothes and they ate in decent restaurants. All they did for a living was beg on the streets.  Then there is the story of the shaky pencil lady that was loaded and lived in Oakvile.  I fell for the mentally ill ones as they can't handle the reality any more, but all they really want is money for booze and/or drugs. The scam artists I don't feel for at all. These are just parasites looking for a free ride. I have a lot more respect for the guy playing his guitar in the subway. At least he is working at it.

Alot of issues arise from your post, no real simple fix. Ive went through tough times too and if I absolutely had to, I would be out there, and my kids would have ate your fritter. But where I live, you can easily forage hunt and fish, if you have the gear. Pretty cheap to snare rabbits as well, but again you need shelter and winter gear etc. People around here are also super kind, its no issue to find work, shelter, food, bartering etc. I feel for those truly in need in the cities though, id imagine it to be much tougher.

The problem is these people begging for money are more than likely using the cash to buy drugs and alcohol. This is why you often see them rejecting food or clothing donations. They don't need or want that stuff, all they want is cash to buy their drugs or booze.   I say keep your money and don't fund their addictions..."

This time he tells the story of coming out of a bank or wherever and a women with a couple of young kids is begging for money to feed her children.

One in four people access a United Way funded program in your area Cliff. No reason to feel bad about those that beg on the side of the road. They know that there is a way to access assistance if they need it; they choose not to go that route for whatever reason. Food banks are also the way to help in your community as you have said. Take the safe route to help out and feel good about that. I know the people that access the United Way funded programs sure appreciate the assistance when required. I personally never give to those begging on the side of the road.
