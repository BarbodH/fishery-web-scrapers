It's time again for the annual and much awaited  2011 Stella Awards    For those unfamiliar with these awards, they are named after 81-year-old Stella Liebeck who spilled hot coffee onherself and successfully sued the McDonald's in New Mexico, where she purchased coffee. You remember, she took the lidoff the coffee and put it between her knees while she was driving. Who would ever think one could get burned doing that,right? That's right; these are awards for the most outlandish lawsuits and verdicts in the U.S. You know the kind ofcases that make you scratch your h ead.So keep your head scratcher handy  Here are the Stellas for this past year -- 2011  *SEVENTH PLACE*  Kathleen Robertson of Austin, Texas was awarded $80,000 by a jury of her peers after breaking her ankle trippingover a toddler who was running inside a furniture store. The store owners were understandably surprised by the verdict,considering the running toddler was her own son.  Start scratching!  * SIXTH PLACE * Carl Truman, 19, of Los Angeles, California won $74,000 plus medical expenses when his neighbor ran over his handwith a Honda Accord.Truman apparently didn't notice there was someone at the wheel of the car when he was trying to steal hisneighbor's hubcaps.   Scratch some more...  * FIFTH PLACE * Terrence Dickson, of Bristol, Pennsylvania, who was leaving a house he had just burglarized by way of the garage.Unfortunately for Dickson, the automatic garage door opener malfunctioned and he could not get the garage door to open.Worse, he couldn't re-enter the house because the door connecting the garage to the house locked when Dickson pulled itshut.Forced to sit for eight, count 'em, EIGHT days and survive on a caseof Pepsi and a large bag of dry dog food, he sued the homeowner'sinsurance company claiming undue mental Anguish. Amazingly, the jury said the insurance company must pay Dickson$500,000 for his anguish. We should all have this kind of anguish Keep scratching. There are more...  Double hand scratching after this one..  *FOURTH PLACE* Jerry Williams, of Little Rock, Arkansas, garnered 4th Place in theStella's when he was awarded $14,500 plus medical expenses after being bitten on the butt by his next doorneighbor's beagle - even though the beagle was on a chain in its owner's fenced yard. Williams did not get as much as heasked for because the jury believed the beagle might have been provoked at the time of the butt bite because Williamshad climbed over the fence into the yard and repeatedly shot the dog with a pellet gun. Pick a new spot to scratch, you're getting a bald spot..  * THIRD PLACE * Amber Carson of Lancaster, Pennsylvania because a jury ordered aPhiladelphia restaurant to pay her $113,500 after she slipped on aspilled soft drink and broke her tailbone. The reason the soft drink was on the floor: Ms. Carson had thrown itat her boyfriend 30 seconds earlier during an argument. What ever happened to people being responsible for their ownactions?  Only two more so ease up on the scratching...  *SECOND PLACE* Kara Walton, of Claymont, Delaware sued the owner of a night club in a nearby city because she fell from thebathroom window to the floor, knocking out her two front teeth. Even though Ms. Walton was trying to sneak through theladies room window to avoid paying the $3.50 cover charge, the jury said the night club had to pay her $12,000....oh,yeah, plus dental expenses. Go figure.  Ok. Here we go!! Drum roll ...  * FIRST PLACE * This year's runaway First Place Stella Award winner was: Mrs. MervGrazinski of Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, who purchased new 32-foot Winnebago motor home.On her first trip home, from an OU football game, having driven on to the freeway, she set the cruise control at70 mph and calmly left the driver's seat to go to the back of the Winnebago to make herself a sandwich not surprisingly,the motor home left the freeway, crashed and overturned. Also not surprisingly, Mrs. Grazinski sued Winnebago for notputting in the owners manual that she couldn't actually leave the driver's seat while the cruise control was set. TheOklahoma jury awarded her, are you sitting down? $1,750,000 PLUS a new motor home. Winnebago actually changed theirmanuals as a result of this suit, just in case Mrs. Grazinski has any relatives who might also buy a motor home. If you think the court system is out of control and America has lost ALL common sense, be sure to pass this one on!!!"
