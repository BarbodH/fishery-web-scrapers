673414,blaque,2012-03-06 01:22:00,2419,Great hockey game goin so far for the 8th spot.
673435,blaque,2012-03-06 02:44:00,2419,Come on guys......the leafs may not be on the ice. But they are in this race too. Where's the enthusiasm lol
673436,Rod Caster,2012-03-06 02:51:00,5784,I'm watching too. The crowd was so loud in the second period. Go jets
673437,Rod Caster,2012-03-06 02:53:00,5784,"Oh, and by the way, the Jets are fighting for 3rd place not 8th"
673440,DRIFTER_016,2012-03-06 03:02:00,10439,Of course I'm watching!!! I watch all of their games. I even have tics to see them in TB at the end of the month.
673441,Rod Caster,2012-03-06 03:03:00,5784,Wheeler with a sweet breakaway goal!!!!
673444,blaque,2012-03-06 03:06:00,2419,Alright.....so I'm the one not enthused anymore
673445,DRIFTER_016,2012-03-06 03:11:00,10439,Buffalo fan Blaque?    :rofl2: That goal by Thorburn was SICK!!!!    :good:
673446,solopaddler,2012-03-06 03:13:00,8605,  Can both teams lose? Or maybe spontaneously come down with a really vicious two week stomach flu?  Otherwise no enthusiasm here.
673447,blaque,2012-03-06 03:13:00,2419,Not as sick as I feel right now.
673448,blaque,2012-03-06 03:15:00,2419, Lol......well I'm dealin with a 4 point kick in the nuts right now
673450,Rod Caster,2012-03-06 03:28:00,5784, You can be enthusiastic for a good draft position
673451,TDunn,2012-03-06 03:32:00,680,  Nice! I hope he can pop a few more by the end of the year!     TDunn
673457,rufus,2012-03-06 04:04:00,267,"Who knew Thorburn was a sniper, eh? I must admit that I am a conflicted Jets fan. Since Carlyle is an ex Jet and was in Winnipeg for over a decade I like to see him do well with the Leafs. Especially since he liked to spend all his free time fishing!  Maybe Toronto can have 8th if the Jets get 3rd...."
673468,Garfisher,2012-03-06 06:47:00,229,"As long as Winnipeg can come back from their quick trip out west with at least 2 points I'm happy (I would like to see them beat Vancouver but I do have my doubts). Hopefully Ottawa can beat Tampa Bay tomorrow night,and Carolina can pull off a win in Washington."
673485,rufus,2012-03-06 12:53:00,267, The Vancouver game should be a great game. I know the tickets were like gold last fall already. Lots of ex Winnipeggers in Vancouver to cheer them on.
