672369,Twocoda,2012-03-03 01:17:00,4130,"Finally, a blonde joke with some Canadian content.... As a North Bay trucker stops for a red light on Hwy.11, a Blonde catches up.. She jumps out of her car, runs up to his Truck, and knocks on the door. The trucker lowers the Window, and she says, ""Hi, my name is Heather, and you Are losing some of your load!""  The trucker ignores her and proceeds down the street. When th e truck stops for another red light, the girl Catches up again. She jumps out of her car runs up and Knocks on the door. Again, the trucker lowers the window.  As if they've never spoken, the blonde says brightly, ""Hi, my name is Heather, and you are Losing some of your load!""  Shaking his head, the trucker ignores her again and Continues down the street. At the third red light, the same Thing happens again.  All out of breath, the blonde gets out of her car, runs up, Knocks on the truck door. The trucker lowers the window.. Again she says, ""Hi, my Name is Heather, and you are Losing some of your load!""  When the light turns green the trucker revs up and races to The next light When he stops this time, he hurriedly gets Out of the truck, and runs back to the blonde. He knocks on Her window, and as she lowers it, he says,..............  ""Hi, my nam e is Kevin, it's winter in CANADA , and I'm driving the SALT TRUCK.........."""
672442,Tootsie II,2012-03-03 02:37:00,162,I just tapped by barometer and the needle fell through the floor like I haven't seen in ages. I then came down to the computer and saw this post. Could be an interesting night with the old dog. Heavy winds scare the heck out of him.
672443,irishfield,2012-03-03 02:39:00,26272,It's only 28.88.. that's not Low...
672454,Kawartha Kev,2012-03-03 02:48:00,281,"Another oldie but a goodie!!  The Diary of a Snow Shoveler  December 8 6:00 PM. It started to snow. The first snow of the season and the wife and I took our cocktails and sat for hours by the window watching the huge soft flakes drift down from heaven. It looked like a Grandma Moses Print. So romantic we felt like newlyweds again. I love snow!  December 9 We woke to a beautiful blanket of crystal white snow covering every inch of the landscape. What a fantastic sight! Can there be a more lovely place in the Whole World? Moving here was the best idea I've ever had. Shoveled for the first time in years and felt like a boy again. I did both our driveway and the sidewalks. This afternoon the snowplow came along and covered up the sidewalks and closed in the driveway, so I got to shovel again. What a perfect life.  December 12 The sun has melted all our lovely snow. Such a disappointment. My neighbor tells me not to worry, we'll definitely have a white Christmas. No snow on Christmas would be awful! Bob says we'll have so much snow by the end of winter, that I'll never want to see snow again. I don't think that's possible. Bob is such a nice man, I'm glad he's our neighbor.  December 14 Snow lovely snow! 8"" last night. The temperature dropped to -20. The cold makes everything sparkle so. The wind took my breath away, but I warmed up by shoveling the driveway and sidewalks. This is the life!  The snowplow came back this afternoon and buried everything again. I didn't realize I would have to do quite this much shoveling, but I'll certainly get back in shape this way.  December 15 20 inches forecast. Sold my van and bought a 4x4 Blazer. Bought snow tires for the wife's car and 2 extra shovels. Stocked the freezer.  The wife wants a wood stove in case the electricity goes out. I think that's silly. We aren't in Alaska, after all.  December 16 Ice storm this morning. Fell on my butt on the ice in the driveway putting down salt. Hurt like heck. The wife laughed for one hour, which I think was very cruel.  December 17 Still way below freezing. Roads are too icy to go anywhere.  Electricity was off for 5 hours. I had to pile the blankets on to stay warm. Nothing to do but stare at the wife and try not to irritate her. Guess I should've bought a wood stove, but won't admit it to her. God I hate it when she's right. I can't believe I'm freezing to death in my own living room.  December 20 Electricity's back on, but had another 14"" of the damn stuff last night. More shoveling. Took all day. Darn snowplow came by twice.  Tried to find a neighbor kid to shovel, but they said they're too busy playing hockey. I think they're lying. Called the only hardware store around to see about buying a snow blower and they're out. Might have another shipment in March. I think they're lying. Bob says I have to shovel or the city will have it done and bill me. I think he's lying.  December 22 Bob was right about a white Christmas because 13 more inches of the white crap fell today, and it's so cold it probably won't melt till August. Took me 45 minutes to get all dressed up to go out to shovel and then I had to poop. By the time I got undressed, pooped and dressed again, I was too tired to shovel. Tried to hire Bob who has a plow on his truck for the rest of the winter; but he says he's too busy. I think the jerk is lying.  December 23 Only 2"" of snow today. And it warmed up to 0. The wife wanted me to decorate the front of the house this morning. What is she nuts!!! Why didn't she tell me to do that a month ago? She says she did but I think she's lying.  December 24 6"". Snow packed so hard by snowplow, I broke the shovel. Thought I was having a heart attack. If I ever catch the man who drives that snowplow I'll drag him through the snow by his nose and beat him to death with my broken shovel. I know he hides around the corner and waits for me to finish shoveling and then he comes down the street at 100 miles an hour and throws snow all over where I've just been!  Tonight the wife wanted me to sing Christmas carols with her and open our presents, but I was too busy watching for the snowplow.  December 25 Merry -bleeping- Christmas! 20 more inches of the slop tonight. Snowed in. The idea of shoveling makes my blood boil. I hate the snow! Then the snowplow driver came by asking for a donation and I hit him over the head with my shovel. The wife says I have a bad attitude. I think she's a dang idiot. If I have to watch ""It's A Wonderful Life"" one more time, I'm going to stuff her into the microwave.  December 26 Still snowed in. Why the heck did I ever move here? It was all HER idea. She's really getting on my nerves.  December 27 Temperature dropped to -30 and the pipes froze, plumber came after 14 hours of waiting for him, he only charged me $1400 to replace all my pipes.  December 28 Warmed up to above -20. Still snowed in. THE WITCH is driving me crazy!!!  December 29 10 more inches. Bob says I have to shovel the roof or it could cave in. That's the silliest thing I ever heard. How dumb does he think I am?  December 30 Roof caved in. I beat up the snow plow driver he is now suing me for a million dollars not only the beating I gave him but also for trying to shove the broken snow shovel up where the sun don't shine. The wife went home to her mother. 9"" predicted.  December 31 I set fire to what's left of the house. No more shoveling.  January 8 Feel so good. I just love those little white pills they keep giving me. Why am I tied to the bed?"
672503,Woodsman,2012-03-03 03:30:00,1286,"Sure windy around here. Although no problem here yet, I'm sure there will be some power outages associated with this front."
672509,Handlebarz,2012-03-03 03:39:00,3790,Yep the house is swaying here right now.
672563,misfish,2012-03-03 09:54:00,29133,Truck was swaying pretty good at the stop lights this nmorning. Sounded like a frieght train when I walk out the door this morning as well. Alot of the snow has left us also. Very warm right now.
672564,Big Cliff,2012-03-03 10:49:00,6899,"Well, I had planned to go fishing today but I'm re thinking that one. I'm just going to stay here and work in the shop. Got a bunch of fishing related stuff to do anyway."
672586,Billy Bob,2012-03-03 12:31:00,5865," When I worked on the RR I spent some time working in what we called the Van  Site.....it was where the teamsters would load the trailers from tractor trailers onto flat cars.....my job was to inspect and repair any of the flat cars prior to them loading and then to again inspect their work to make sure the trailers were locked in properly to the stansions....but anyways.....truckers from all over would come in and drop off their trailers, some in the middle of the night when no one was there.....but if they parked their trailers side ways to the wind and we got a real winding night the empties would be lying on their sides come morning....  and there goes our easy work day...."
672614,Fish Farmer,2012-03-03 13:26:00,2234,"Wonder if they canceled the Ice fishing derby on Simcoe. If not, I hope no one gets hurt. Sure glad I'm not out there today."
