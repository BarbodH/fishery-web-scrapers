We did more of this....     Then we drove home.  As was already mentioned...it's not all about the fishing...and this past weekend we relaxed a little, drank a little, ate a little, jammed a little, played a little cards, watched a little bit of TV, and apparently slept a LOT!! LOL.  Thanks once again for a great weekend guys!!"

671873,Spiel,2012-03-01 18:38:00,9065,My kind of weekend.
671876,bassman87,2012-03-01 18:54:00,586,why is that beer not rocky mountain cold?
671885,kickingfrog,2012-03-01 19:18:00,8333, Did you not see the roaring fire??? I'd be shocked if the whole beer didn't just go ppfffff once it was opened.
671887,steel&chrome,2012-03-01 19:23:00,46,looks cold certified outside!!
671889,fishnsled,2012-03-01 19:30:00,3520, I brought the lemons and didn't even cut up one. Plenty of Vodka Tonics though with lime. Our citrus intake was OK I'd say.  Thanks for putting up the pics Cliff.    It was certainly different from the usually trips Chris and no one was complaining. A very relaxing getaway.
671893,kickingfrog,2012-03-01 19:53:00,8333,I think this is the only place where I've heard of lemon drops. I think I may have to google the formula.
671896,fishnsled,2012-03-01 19:59:00,3520," Here ya go.  Lemon Drop shots are similar to Tequila shots. It is more about the process than actually mixing anything together. The lemon and sugar give this shot the real sour kick you'd expect from the name. You can also try the Lemon Drop Martini. Ingredients:   Preparation:  Alternatively, coat the inside of a shot glass with lemon juice and pour sugar on top of the liquid. Shake out any loose sugar and juice. This leaves a sour, sugar coated shot glass that you then pour the vodka into and shoot."
671929,Headhunter,2012-03-01 21:45:00,5703,"  Oh you are a smooth talker aren't you FishnSled!!!! Nice pics Cliff... thanks for puttin them up... I'd have taken pics, but I couldn't reach a camera from my spot on the couch! Spiel, I think we made it through 5 or 6 songs all the way through... some kinda record I think! HH"
671931,kickingfrog,2012-03-01 22:03:00,8333,Thanks. The net gives a few versions. I'll have to experiment.
671978,MJL,2012-03-02 00:35:00,2427,  Do you mean you? Or all the other people? I find it hard to believe that anyone could sleep near a chain-saw going full throttle
671980,ccmtcanada,2012-03-02 00:39:00,7971, Not a lot of things that required effort that weekend!    Was the first beer I opened after we arrived..the rest were chilling in the fridge!   Hey now!  We actually all had our own rooms.....smart
671988,GBW,2012-03-02 00:50:00,8460,It must have been real hot there as just look how red HH's face was and I bet he was on the other side of the room!
