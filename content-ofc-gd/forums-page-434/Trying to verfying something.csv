673378,paul_614,2012-03-05 23:43:00,168,I have a friend that wants to sell a deer mount. I mentioned that I thought it was illegal. Am I right?
673383,paul_614,2012-03-05 23:54:00,168,She said she was going to glue a hockey card on the back and sell the card. Thought that was an original idea
673385,misfish,2012-03-05 23:58:00,29133,"Just step back and say,nada."
673388,paul_614,2012-03-06 00:01:00,168,I did tell her I would be the donee
673390,solopaddler,2012-03-06 00:05:00,8605,Yes it would be illegal.  I unwittingly posted a beautiful mount of two brookies for sale in the OFC classifieds recently.  I had no idea it was illegal. Was informed pretty quickly though.
673396,Joey,2012-03-06 00:17:00,9122,Guess she could gift it to the recipient and then they could give her a nice gift of money in return
673424,mikeseb,2012-03-06 02:06:00,201,"Thank god its illegal.  Otherwise every trophy fish that is ever caught would turn into a ""trophy"" and sold to somebody who wants a good story to tell to his buddies.  Pics are good enough for me no need to kill a fish and keep it as a decoration."
673427,kickingfrog,2012-03-06 02:14:00,8333,Yet another reason for a replica mount for a fish. Your wife can sell it at the yard sale.
673428,BillM,2012-03-06 02:17:00,17367,I haven't seen many replica mounts look as good as the skin mounts my oldman has...   They almost look cartoon-ish in comparison.
