673482,Billy Bob,2012-03-06 12:45:00,5865, And just think.....water is being sold at or sometime many times more then a gallon of gasoline.....who would ever of thought that would happen and no one complains about the price of bottled water....I myself can count on one hand the times I purchased a bottle of water.....now beer is another story....LOL....
673507,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2012-03-06 14:53:00,0, there's 1000 more fools born every day.
673217,Headhunter,2012-03-05 14:30:00,5703,"I'm no rocket scientist as you can tell by my posts here   , but can anyone tell me how/why this works this way???  http://www.sootoday.com/content/news/full_story.asp?StoryNumber=50683  HH"
673219,BillM,2012-03-05 14:37:00,17367,Supercooling is an amazing thing
673220,Rod Caster,2012-03-05 14:42:00,5784,"The water will go a few degrees below 0 and stay liquid until the molecules are disturbed. Bill said it right, it's called supercooling.  Somewhat the same effect when you open an extremely cold beer, starts off as liquid, then eventually turns to slush."
673222,4x4bassin,2012-03-05 14:46:00,1025,"That happens as well with beer when you leave them outside to cool to long ,as  soon as you open it , it freezes up on ya right in front of your eyes  . I kinda wonder why that happens myself !"
673225,BillM,2012-03-05 14:49:00,17367,This is why you gotta shotgun those beers ASAP!!  LOL

673230,Old Man,2012-03-05 14:56:00,822,   Mmmm ... Slush Beer.
673232,adempsey,2012-03-05 15:01:00,1498,  It also works in the other direction and is why you don't microwave purified water.
673237,dave524,2012-03-05 15:26:00,4508,"OK, smart guys, why is it when you take spring water that has been sitting down there 100's maybe 1000's of years, put it in a bottle and suddenly it has an expiry date Whats'up with that"
673240,Rod Caster,2012-03-05 15:31:00,5784,  Bacteria and or UV light would change some of chemical properties of the water. Underground is very sterile with no light penetration..... the other factor is companies trying to make money probably.
673242,limeyangler,2012-03-05 15:48:00,5204,Happens in my 5 gallon minnow storage bucket all the time....liquid until i try to scoop out a couple dozen....then i got minnow slurpie
673248,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2012-03-05 16:02:00,0,i think the funniest part of all this is that people actually PAY for bottles of water!  hahahahahaha
673256,hammercarp,2012-03-05 16:16:00,964,lol! I'm with you on that.
673262,kickingfrog,2012-03-05 16:44:00,8333,"Beer, and other carbonated drinks, are also under pressure. ""Boiling"" water is much different as you go up very high mountains because of the lack of pressure."
673267,Fisherman,2012-03-05 17:24:00,7201," Amen on that one.  If I get my city water at $1.18 a cubic meter, why would anyone pay $0.20 for one 1 litre bottle.  For those unaware, a cubic meter equals  1000 - 1 litre or 2000 - 500ml bottles.  That means I pay $0.00118 cents per litre.  You can sure filter a lot of water through a Brita system and still come out far ahead.  All you have to do is...omg there's work involved."
673273,Big Cliff,2012-03-05 17:43:00,6899,"OK, but what is it costing me /liter for my water? I have a well with an iron sulpher remover, a UV system to make sure there is no bacteria in the water and a 5 stage RO system to make sure that my water is absolutly pure. I guess you'd have to factor in the cost to maintain the well and pump, the hydro to pump and purify the water, the amount of water wasted by the RO system, the hydro to run the RO system and time, the cost to maintain the septic system because of the extra volume of water produced by the RO system. Now, that doesn't include the health costs associated with drinking chloraneted water, the dental costs because of the lack of floridation in my water. Far too complicated for this old brain to figure out! I think I'll just carry on knowing that I don't have any chemicals added to my water and it is as pure as I can get it."
673278,cjgraham,2012-03-05 18:08:00,104,I used to do this with my chemistry students. Only works with distilled water. extremely cool
673279,Big Cliff,2012-03-05 18:21:00,6899," OK, so why is that? I am interested in knowing!"
673293,Big Cliff,2012-03-05 19:54:00,6899,Saw a thing on internet the other day where they are using 2L bottles of water with a bit of chlorine in it and using them as a light. Apparently generates 55W. They put them in the roof of a building and the sun hits the bottle and I'm not sure how it works or why the chlorine but I saw the results. Was very impressive! Science is so amazing!

673300,Headhunter,2012-03-05 20:16:00,5703,Who knew we had so many smart people here! LOL Thanks for the answers folks!  HH
673306,fishnsled,2012-03-05 20:28:00,3520," Seen that clip awhile ago and it was pretty cool. I'm guessing that the chlorine is just to keep the water from getting any algae growth and keeping it clear. Was thinking of trying it on my old shed before I tear it down. Would be cool to see it first hand, not sure how it would stand up to our changing climate though."
673313,Big Cliff,2012-03-05 20:43:00,6899," So, I wonder how much antifreeze we would have to put in the bottle and if that would have any effect on it. Might be a good way to add a light to an ice hut! Might be a good way to add lights to my boat house too."
673403,skeeter,2012-03-06 00:58:00,1907,"Big Cliff, your answer is in post #1. Just buy bottled water and put them in the roof. As long as you don't turn the hut upside down, the water won't freeze."
673419,lookinforwalleye,2012-03-06 01:43:00,4399, Ya what he said!!!
