672301,spincast,2012-03-02 22:31:00,3279,Welcome Juli - from honorary to offical member. Now you can join in the on line fun when you get the biggest fish  between you guys Can't wait till we're all on the water together again. Oh and I'm sure there wont be any family rivalry if you and Frank are on 2 different teams in the tourney!

672540,irishfield,2012-03-03 04:08:00,26272,At least Frankie knew you could outfish him before you joined up Juli! Shouldn't effect your relationship in the least..
672561,tonka-toy,2012-03-03 07:10:00,139,hello juli
672566,Big Cliff,2012-03-03 10:59:00,6899,"A wonderful intro, super pictures, and a fantastic looking family! Welcome to our little community!"
672038,FisherJuli,2012-03-02 02:36:00,125,"Helloooooo, fellow fisherfolk! You may know me as the one that outfished Frankie65- the one that caught the last one, the biggest one, the weirdest one. Well, they're all correct (from time to time, and when the story needs telling!!)... but most of the time, I am just having fun fishing with my awesome partner Frankie65, my boys, my family, and my friends.    I was lucky enough to grow up with a super fisher-Dad, so it's definitely in my blood and there isn't a pretty lure in my tacklebox that isn't ready for the challenge on a moments' notice!! (he buys me lures for my birthday, as does my Frankie!)    To start off my fishing adventures, I always want to show the Boys that us Gals can fish with the best of them, and that there's little difference between us when it comes to the love of the sport... but at the end of the day, great pics, fish and stories are what I enjoy the most and I don't care who got it- so long as we've had fun.    I especially love my fishing adventures with Frankie65, and am lucky to be with a man with such as passion for it. When I get old, I can tell the story about the toothiest, the ugliest, the tiniest, and the levetating line. While perchies are my favorite to eat, I love to fish for them all. I know that I get a bit more impatient for the deep, elusive fish, but that's where my passion for the camera fits in!    So, enough about me... let's fish- well, let's count down the days until soft water now, and be safe on the last of that ice!  "
