672841,icefisherman,2012-03-04 00:32:00,952,"OK guys...10 days left in this ""ice season"" ...I hear lake is open in the middle and chunks of ice keep braking off the shore line and floating East...anyone know if there are any launches (preferably on the West side) that are free of ice? Thanks.  Cheers, Ice Fisherman"

672883,Sinker,2012-03-04 02:33:00,8692,"There are whities, but not many, and its a loooong ways to get them lol   S."
672886,icefisherman,2012-03-04 02:43:00,952,"Well then I think we should concentrate on the boat access...I have a feeling if we manage to do it there are lot of whities waiting for us....and with so few of them been caught this season...imagine the show ha ha ha....the ones I got last weekend were very fat too  Cheers, Ice Fisherman"
