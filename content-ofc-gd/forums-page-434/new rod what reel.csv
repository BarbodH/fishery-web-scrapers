672718,skinny,2012-03-03 19:26:00,442,ok so I got a new rod at the london Fishing show it is a sellus baitcast. So now I will have to find a reel for it. I'm open to sugestions and possible purchase of used reel. I curently have 2 baitcast reels on of each hand but when I use a spining set up I reel with my left. So I think I'm looking for a left hand reel  Let me know what you think I should use and why and pm me if you have something used
672720,uglyfish,2012-03-03 19:33:00,981,"A shimano chronarch can't be beat. Quantum energy PT or a smoke PT are 2 great choices as well.  If u wanna look for a used reel, PM me, I have a few models all left hand I'm likely gonna be selling soon."
672735,Roy,2012-03-03 20:36:00,13728,We have no idea what to recommend. Which rod is it and what are you fishing for? Which other baitcasters do you have?
672747,DaveMc,2012-03-03 21:08:00,89,"with that rod in mind i wouldn't really want to break the bank on a very expensive reel, the Caenan from Shimano would fit the bill nicely.   *note* Sellus is a new 2012 line from Shimano"
672860,skinny,2012-03-04 00:56:00,442,"here is the specs on the rod  length  6'10"" power  medium heavy action fast construction 24 ton  it is also labled spinnerbait"
672872,grimsbylander,2012-03-04 01:46:00,3016,I too just bought a new rod and reel today! Quantum EXO PT spinning and a St. Croix Avid rod. COME ON APRIL 1st!!!!!!
673028,GBW,2012-03-04 20:06:00,8460,"get a used shimano or the new Caenan If I was you, I would be PM'ing uglyfish!"
