I remember someone posting a website a while back, I believe it was run by the MNR. On the website it had a map with all the lakes in Ontario and when you click on it, it shows you the fish species. Just wondering if anyone knows it if they can post it up for me. Thanks in Advance Bassmaster4"

673073,spincast,2012-03-04 22:18:00,3279,This one? My link
673080,Rod Caster,2012-03-04 22:38:00,5784,There's also this one for Northern Ontario  http://www.nomap.ca/(S(3u1ad4iw15n0ck23wtzbuxrh))/Home.aspx

673090,Rod Caster,2012-03-04 23:21:00,5784, Haha you saw my original post before I changed it. I re-read the topic name and decided to edit  This is the book I referenced in my original post Freshwater Fishes of Canada by W.B. Scott and E.J. Crossman
673098,boombap,2012-03-05 00:06:00,310,I doubt it's very accurate.  Pike and carp in rice lake?
673133,bassmaster4,2012-03-05 02:20:00,801,lol thanks for the site and thanks for letting me know its outdated
673253,mikeseb,2012-03-05 16:09:00,201, What a great site I wish I knew of this last year!  I now know of a half dozen lakes that are a 10 minute dirt bike ride away from my 100 acre getaway that have a nice variety of species.  Now im really itching for the warm weather to get here so I can get out and explore!!
