671846,grt1,2012-03-01 17:34:00,638,"I was glancing through a bass pro catalogue and saw this abu Revo mtx reel, it looked pretty interesting so i started checking out the prices in other stores. generally the price range is anywhere from $342 at lebarons to $369 at cabelas canada , bass pro (US) and Cabelas (US) were both $349.  I went to the bass pro site and cliked on the web page that described the reel and read the reviews from customers, they were all raving about it, but , how can you judge the reviews for being independent and not planted. (if you know what i mean).  So I figured , if i'm going to spend that kind of money on a reel, (and i'm really torn on whether or not an expensive reel will catch any more fish than a cheaper reel) I'd like to hear what the people on a site I trust have to say about the reel.  Any comments, pro or con would be appreciated."

To me the sub 200 dollar market has lots to offer that meet my needs. I would rather save a hundred dollars on the reel and get a more sensitive rod. This will put more fish in the boat imo."

671975,curryale,2012-03-02 00:26:00,26,I purchased an MDX recently off of ebay for 285 new.  Best deal I could get by far.  It you are interested you might be best to check there first.  Very nice reel - quite light.  I have not been able to use it yet though so I can't give you a review.  It feels similar to a quantum smoke which is another reel that I really like.
672014,Stef,2012-03-02 01:48:00,63,"I have an Abu Revo Premier purchased the first year they came out, it was the top of the line for Abu/Revo then.  Light weight, low profile, very smooth and no problems.  Its the best of the five or so baitcasters I own.  As to whether you'll catch more fish with a quality reel, probably not.  But, if you enjoy fishing and CAN AFFORD IT, you'll gain your moneys worth in pleasure casting a high end reel (of whatever make turns you on) and won't be sorry to have spent the extra...."
672015,salmon,2012-03-02 01:48:00,334,Look for feedback on a couple of sites  Tackle Tour will be your best bet the recently did a review on the MGX reel (MDX) I was going to try one but after some thought I dedided not to.  Also tacklewarehouse in the US has reviews form customers on the reel.  Hope thie helps
672117,krixxer,2012-03-02 11:29:00,274,I boubt you'll notice any practical performance improvment over a SX or STX.
672681,fish-miester,2012-03-03 15:59:00,864,"I have had the STX since they came out, loved it ever since, also have some other reels. and still prefer this one over it, the thing is a tank of a reel!"
