I paid the advertised rate, not knowing what that really means. Ipage has a lot of good stuff it provides for beginners like me, emails, support, data bases and web tools .Except they stick you on a server jammed with so many other low monthly subscribers, your site takes forever to load most times. The statistics they provide is pretty awesome, it tells me that almost ½ of my visits are 0 to 30 sec long, when it takes longer than that to load my site in most cases. So those visits are wasted. While building my site I have played thousands of FreeCell games waiting for updates too change. Anyway I thought I would mention this so you know what will probably happen by going at a cheaper monthly rate and that goes for other hoisting providers. I would be more than happy to log on to other sites hosted with Ipage to compare but I don’t know any. Mine is www.Fishingmikeystyle.ca  "
673109,Roy,2012-03-05 00:51:00,13728,I don't understand your rant. If you have a problem with your internet host why don't you talk to them?
673110,danbouck,2012-03-05 00:59:00,4380,I run a few websites for $0 a month and they load up instantly. I suggest you speak with your host
673121,Mikeyfish,2012-03-05 01:25:00,21,I have done that many times and I'm not ranting. I'm just letting whoever might be looking for a host the down side. Dan I also run my sons site and it does not cost any more except for his site doman name and  do you have you own server.
