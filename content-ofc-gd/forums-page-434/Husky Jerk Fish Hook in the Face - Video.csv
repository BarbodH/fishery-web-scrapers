672637,Djeep,2012-03-03 14:12:00,199,"Im sure lots of members have had an unfortunate incident where someone ends up getting hooked!  Let's hear your experiences. Here is one of mine.  Below is a link to a video I made of a fishing trip last fall that went sour on the first cast.  My buddy in the back of the boat got a lil overzealous, I dont fish with him anymore lol! After working the barb loose, it popped right out. The most painful part was the initial smack to the face lol.  "
672641,mike rousseau,2012-03-03 14:17:00,4661,Ouch...  Somehow I've never had a hook make it in to the barb...  Just some cuts and pokes...  Ouch...
672643,Rod Caster,2012-03-03 14:26:00,5784,"yeeouch! You were very calm.  I've also been lucky and only had a few minor incidents in my life.  Last week was a CLOSE call though.... I caught a perch on my tippup then noticed my second line dropping, I ran to the second line not knowing that I was twisted in the first one. Just before I reached the hole, the hook flipped up right at my neck, barely missing me."
672644,Nipfisher,2012-03-03 14:27:00,2449, A double-header and almost 1 neck.
672653,Djeep,2012-03-03 14:45:00,199,"That would be scary, a hook in the neck! I'm just thankful I didn't get it in the eye."
672657,mike rousseau,2012-03-03 14:49:00,4661,I buddy got a sinker in the eye after his freinds hook pulled while netting a big salmon... He's blind in that eye now...  I remember this everytime I'm netting a fish... I make sure the rod isn't loaded directly above or behind me...
672660,Djeep,2012-03-03 14:54:00,199,That is a good thing to keep in mind! Luckily this has not yet occurred to myself or one of my buddies and I'll be sure to mention it next time I have the net.

672664,mercman,2012-03-03 15:05:00,7054,"Touch wood, i have never been hooked. I have,however,hooked my dads glasses and used them as bait,when i was a kid, and once, i hooked the brim of my own hat, and pitched it into the water. BUT I DONT DO THAT ANYMORE THOUGH.... Just in case we ever fish together."
672668,BillM,2012-03-03 15:12:00,17367,Your truly showing how to NOT land a smallie with a bunch of hooks hanging out of it's face.  
672680,zamboniwaterboy,2012-03-03 15:50:00,126,Here are some videos on hook removal.    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQQ9PelPqQk&feature=related    
672698,Djeep,2012-03-03 18:11:00,199,Yeah nice videos guys! I figured if I pulled hard enough it would come out haha
672707,davey buoy,2012-03-03 18:26:00,5505,"A buddy of mine likes to set the hook so hard ,a couple of times a day you hear the lure go by your head.Scares the heck out of us.He just can't help the excitement when a fish hits. No one has been injured as of yet. Luckily he only gets out with us three or four times a year."

672712,Spouph,2012-03-03 19:11:00,115,"long story short port stanely young like 8years old, learning to cast had one go wild but did not know.  Felt a tug and set the hook like dad taught me.  I faought that fish hard it felt like a big one.......turns out it was some poor bugger walking down the peir, got him right in the knee.....i'll never forget the car ride home.  Dad just said nice hook set.	lol true story"
672767,Djeep,2012-03-03 21:49:00,199,spouph thats too funny!
673092,Jigger,2012-03-04 23:28:00,1237,"Going back about a decade, a buddy of mine took a fully loaded Suick to the back of the head. Problem was too many people in the boat, guy loaded the rod and as he was pitching forward caught the guy all the way to the bend. I wasn't there, but both guys have gotten over it  since and laugh about it every now and again. ALWAYS wear glasses!!"
673126,Lunatic,2012-03-05 01:45:00,536,megadeth - hook in mouth!
673127,Jewelbee,2012-03-05 02:01:00,422,I think Joey might have a story or 2 on this subject
