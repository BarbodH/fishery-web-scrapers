672195,sneak_e_pete,2012-03-02 15:58:00,540,When are the browns in shallow?  Also are there any free boat launches in Grimsby?
672200,Steve Piggott,2012-03-02 16:31:00,196,They are catching brown now.There are no free launch ramps
672273,Live2fish85,2012-03-02 21:39:00,1633,There is a free launch in Grimsby at the old pump house but it isnt the safest launch to be using.
672296,sneak_e_pete,2012-03-02 22:25:00,540,Where are the launches?  I refuse to pay $25 bucks at 50 point which is 1 minute away from me
672311,misfish,2012-03-02 23:04:00,29133," 25 BUCKS???????????? WTH is that? Total, rip ya new one charge."
672313,dave524,2012-03-02 23:20:00,4508,"................... Vehicle and driver: $9.00 Each additional passenger: $4.75 Walk/Bike in per person: $4.75  Summer Sunset Special - Applies to entry after 6:00pm from April 1st to October 31st Maximum fee per vehicle $13.75  Off season per vehicle rates: Fifty Point - $9.00 December 1 to March 31 inclusive Christie Lake - $9.00 November 1 to March 31 inclusive ........................  should be $9 till the end of the month, then they get you $25 for the vehicle with 3 passengers. This is from the Hamilton Conservation Authority website. Actually you are paying entrance to the park and not the launch specifically.  Forans Marina in town is still listing $120 for a season's pass, pretty good deal."
672315,Live2fish85,2012-03-02 23:24:00,1633,Yea 50 Point is a rip off. There is Forans Marina and the other which are right beside the Stryx Bowling in Grimsby. I am not sure if they are open or if there is any Ice covering. The other is by the old pump house which is a free one. I wouldn't use that one unless I was in a tinner that I didn't care about.  I think Forans and the other launch are around 10 bucks.
672353,Steve Piggott,2012-03-03 00:40:00,196,Jordan harbour  was 10.00 last year 120 for the season.
672600,Fish Farmer,2012-03-03 13:00:00,2234,"Yes 50 pt. is $23 to launch, which is gouging!!!.   The ramp is closed till??? I sent a letter to the OFAH on this issue. There should be more public launches. Seems like Marinas and townships, close, fill-in the free ones to force you to pay ridiculous fees. These are our lakes and they hold us at bay, to take advantage. If they must charge, it should be governed at $10.00 MAX. Cottage associations, I don't want to get into that one."
672636,Pigeontroller,2012-03-03 14:08:00,2793,"Thats one way the USA has us beat, the free launches in NYS are everywhere..."
