672305,Pikeslayer,2012-03-02 22:47:00,1443,"Thanks for the kind comments all. Yep, she's a cutie all right. I bought her first rod the day she was born 10.10.10. For Christmas a proper sized PFD. I figure Leah will be ready for panfish off the dock in September when the bugs start to disappear. Assuming we can keep her out of the water ( no fear)  Regards, Simon"
