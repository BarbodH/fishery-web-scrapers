672345,misfish,2012-03-03 00:27:00,29133,"Lots of talk about good ice,but if we get the wind thy are calling for,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"
672370,Fisherman,2012-03-03 01:20:00,7201,I would stay south of Lefroy just to be on the safe side.  Last week there was 10-12 inches around the 2nd line.  That's all I'll admit to.
672424,RickOnt,2012-03-03 02:16:00,669,"Been Fishing from Gilford to Little Cedar to the PumpHouse to Roches  this week. Where I have drilled  Holes  12"" Ice in the Gilford area to 8-10 up at Little Cedar Which is the first point North of Lefroy.  Starting to get some slush spots, more so in the Roches Point area. not too deep maybe 8"" you shouldn't get stuck but it will slow you down!  Lots of Fish but LOTS of Dinks.  Always find enough for a meal.  Slab Grabber, Forage minnow and the Bug doing the catching.           Rick"
