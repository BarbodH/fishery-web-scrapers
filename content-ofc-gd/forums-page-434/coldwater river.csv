672965,fishinmortician,2012-03-04 16:12:00,100,A few weeks back someone posted about coldwater river including maps.  I have searched and cannot find them on here.  Can anyone help?    Thanks for the help.
672968,BillM,2012-03-04 16:25:00,17367,All the links are available via the MNR site below.  http://www.mnr.gov.on.ca/en/Business/LetsFish/Publication/STEL02_163615.html
673008,fishinmortician,2012-03-04 18:46:00,100,"Thanks, didn't know the smaller maps were available.  Thats a huge help!"
673010,BillM,2012-03-04 19:02:00,17367," Yeah, my good buddy Dave pointed it out in the last thread before it was deleted.  A lot easier to figure things out...   It's too bad they just don't come out and say it in the normal regs!  I was down in Coldwater the other day, river was ragging after all that rain!"
673011,alexmedic,2012-03-04 19:07:00,186,"Funny,  I was there last Thursday and it was low and as clear as gin.  I guess that was before the rain though.."
673013,SirCranksalot,2012-03-04 19:15:00,3291,"Maybe I'm a bit slow, but I've been told there are several kms of the CW open all year but I still can't find that in the regs."
673016,alexmedic,2012-03-04 19:34:00,186,"Fish anywhere south of Moonstone Road, and you could be in trouble."
673018,BillM,2012-03-04 19:35:00,17367, That river blows out easily.  Doesn't take much.   Especially with the rain they had Sat night.
673046,misfish,2012-03-04 21:02:00,29133,"  The post before IMO,was to discriptive. Hope what Bill gave you is helpful.  Al the rivs around here are blown. Ice and slush."
673087,wallacio,2012-03-04 23:05:00,475,Here's the map with the open season boundaries shown.  http://www.mnr.gov.on.ca/stdprodconsume/groups/lr/@mnr/@letsfish/documents/geospatialmaterial/241300.pdf
673106,Rustic-Fisher,2012-03-05 00:32:00,826,While your willingness to help a fellow angler is commendable. Sticking with PMs is a good idea on this one
673111,wallacio,2012-03-05 01:00:00,475, Give me a break...do you honestly think that posting a link showing the year-round open season for a given river is going to cause any harm?   It's no different than stating that the Notty and Credit (to name a few) have year-round open seasons as well.    There is a HUGE difference in clarifying regulations and posting river reports complete with pictures (often with recognizable backgrounds)...something that you don't seem to have a problem with doing on a regular basis.
673120,Rustic-Fisher,2012-03-05 01:21:00,826,"Bud, your a beauty, funny enough I've fished with you, you know Brent L. Remember Dave, Internet is not anonymous. If you want to mouth off with a keyboard please do it through PMs lol"
673130,SirCranksalot,2012-03-05 02:11:00,3291," Thx very much for posting this info which should be readily available to all of us! Somehow I could not find a link to those maps from the link posted further above in this thread. It's a shame, as someone else already said above, that this info is not published in the paper version.   "
673141,BillM,2012-03-05 03:11:00,17367, Second link under the picture...  Not really hard to find if you actually click it
