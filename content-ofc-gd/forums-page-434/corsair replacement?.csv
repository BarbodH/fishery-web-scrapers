672057,jedimaster,2012-03-02 03:05:00,3472,Anyone know if shimano is still replacing corsairs with a corvalus?
672519,Rizzo,2012-03-03 03:45:00,4754,what's this? I have a corsair I haven't used in a few years because it was junk. Are you saying I could trade it in for something that is less junk?
672627,Raf,2012-03-03 13:52:00,3495,no the corvalus is junk too
672820,esoxansteel,2012-03-04 00:13:00,1307,"No there replacing them with Calcutta TEs or LJVs, and throwing in a Loomis NRX for your troubles"
673029,jedimaster,2012-03-04 20:13:00,3472,They were doing it a few years ago. The silver ones for free and the gold ones for an extra 30 bucks. I think this is long since over though.
673406,Rizzo,2012-03-06 01:03:00,4754,go figure. I have a silver one which I used for maybe one season when I first started musky fishing. Used it this past fall a bit for some vertical jigging. Real piece of junk. Made me remember why I retired it even when I was new to the sport
