This is the first time ive ever seen this type of worm in a fish's stomach. There was 4 of them about 3 or 4 inches long, white, flat body and segmented. Has anyone else seen this or heard of it ? sory no pics forgot the camera in the hut ."

I found one in some bear dung last year, measured 32 inches...that's right i went and got a tape measure then measured it....it was massive.  -Dave"
