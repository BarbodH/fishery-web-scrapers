Our water is quite soft, and about 55 degrees so the Bass should start thinking about spawning in another few weeks.  We are well and enjoying the weather. Buck continues to swim whenever he gets the chance.    While I prefer to stay in the boat    My daughter was here for a month and we did the tourist thing...like visiting Mexico and trying on big hats.   And some non-serious fishing...    We had lots of fun on the water even if we didn't fish very hard... One day while taking trying a few cast during a boat ride,  I caught a broken line which had a Rattle-trap on the end... ""This"" I quickly said, ""calls for a picture!""    Not to be out-done she struck a pose with this box of candy.    Buck and I went fishing at Martinez Lake yesterday. That's a flooded backwater of the Colorado River, just north of town. It was very windy and no one I spoke with had any luck. We have clear skies a real ""Blue Bird Day"" so it wasn't surprising that the fish had lock-jaw. It was however a fine ""T"" shirt fishing day and on the 17th of January you have to like that... Notice that I said ""T"" shirt because I don't want to mention that it's around 80F. this week. I won't say anything else about the weather because I know that some folks are having non-Dairy Queen blizzards...GRIN. We are expecting a mid-week cold snap...down to 73 or 74...Brrrr!   On the way home we saw a nice White Tail buck walking beside the road. I whistled to get him to stop and look my way...    We will be home about the time that Crappie season opens...if the snow in my driveway ever melts...HAHAHA. Garry2R's"

294285,Radnine,2009-01-19 00:18:00,1538,"Let's see......55 x 2 + 30...140 degrees!! That's too hot, I'm glad I am up here. Jim"
294286,Zubris21,2009-01-19 00:19:00,563,Thanks for taking the time to post!  Its nice to see some open water once again!
294335,Garry2Rs,2009-01-19 01:26:00,1425,"Brian...Glad you like the picture, I you want a larger version let me know.  You can stop nagging about my ratty front seat, I have a new butt-seat on back-order at Cabela's Jim...That's the wrong formula.  A water temperature of 55F = 12.778C.  The daytime high of 80F = 26.667, but it's a dry heat so you can round it down to 26C...wink!"
294337,Raf,2009-01-19 01:29:00,3495,"man, what did you do to deserve all that cruel and unusual punishment."
294339,misfish,2009-01-19 01:31:00,29133,"Yes please Garry. One for the wall, would be AWESOME.  As for the butt seat,glad to hear yer on top of that.LOL"
