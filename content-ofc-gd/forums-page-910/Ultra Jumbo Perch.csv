294793,Clampet,2009-01-20 00:33:00,1947," In a NewYork city apartment a young boy named Josh Morrison (Austin Lynd Myers) watches through his telescope an approaching object coming from the sky. It is a golf ball-sized metal ball which flies through the window of his room and lands in his fishbowl, quickly draining the water. He keeps it and shows it at school in a science class presentation. Some months later, on Liberty Island a massive fireball crash lands. The fireball is actually a spaceship resembling a human (Eddie Murphy). It is controlled by 100 humanoid aliens, each one inch tall."
