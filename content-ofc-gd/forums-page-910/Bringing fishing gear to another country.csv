I am going in the summer and am going to be fishing with some relatives. By problems i mean will i get charged or get my gear confiscated. Thanks in advance."
294749,rbaquial,2009-01-19 23:27:00,968,"I don't think you will. I think the RODS and REELS you can bring as CARRY-ON, but the HOOKS and OTHER SHARP OBJECTS need to be put in your luggage or whatever. (As long as the SHARP OBJECTS aren't brought with you physically on-board)"
294752,solopaddler,2009-01-19 23:30:00,8605,To get it to your destination safely and cheaply you might consider mailing it to an address in Poland beforehand.  That's what I did with my equipment when I went to Alaska in Sept.

One was ""do you have any firearms or knives"".  Of course I said NO and was OKed to proceed. But I only got a few hundred feet when I though I have at least 6 fillet knives in the boat and truck. How do they expect you to fish without a knife or two."
294764,WeedLine,2009-01-19 23:45:00,322,"You can put your rods in a lockable rod tube. Make sure the rods are tightly bundled with masking tape, elastic bands, etc. Stuff the  top with something soft  so the tips won't break. Carry your reels and plastic stowaways(lures) in your luggage. It worked for me. You can buy lockable, adjustable rod tubes at BPS and Labarons. They can fit 3 maybe 4 rods."
