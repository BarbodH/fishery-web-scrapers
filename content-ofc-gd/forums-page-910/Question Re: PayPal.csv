294306,BillM,2009-01-19 00:52:00,17367,All people need is the email account associated with your Paypal account.  
294317,drwxr,2009-01-19 01:04:00,453,paypal takes long time to clear the payment though... you can also try interac its much faster.
294321,irishfield,2009-01-19 01:07:00,26272,Paypal is instant from a Credit card or someone that transfers from a bank account that is already confirmed by Paypal. Only thing that delays is e-cheques and usually only 5 days.  Like Bill said Maureen.. all they need is the email address that you used to open the account. Could even be smart and edit what you used with Paypal (if you didn't already do it this way) and set it up as tylericef[emailÂ protected] or similar to keep it seperate/straight forward.

I can't afford to pay a lot of money to recieve money   I know charities are exempt, but this does not qualify as a charity...  Maureen"
