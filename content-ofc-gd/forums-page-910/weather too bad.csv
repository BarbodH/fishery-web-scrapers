295016,jwl,2009-01-20 14:44:00,1056,"pretty nice video there,puts a whole other dimension on the fishing thing when you can see them...I would be sitting there saying..""come on....come on...take it..."" and sitting on the edge of my seat in anticipation      You can weed through the really little ones that way...you see them come up to your bait and just yank it away from them"
295046,Terry,2009-01-20 16:40:00,14456,"yeah watching them is way cool I spent maybe an hour pulling the bait away from them rather then catching them, just to play and watch  to see how they react and if there are lots of fish pulling it away can sure turn them all on"
294177,Terry,2009-01-18 20:33:00,14456,"Well I was to go to irishfields to go out on georgian bay  but the roads were bad, and by the time I got to 400 and 89 I knew I would be way late getting to his house and wasn't feeling good about driving so I turned around and went home yup chickened out.....Sorry Wayne  well as it started getting light out I thought to myself...self  you should try getting to lake simcoe, why waist the day  so I did I thought I would go to innisfil as other OFNers were there  as I made my way again the snow and wind started and I decided to just turn at 89 and go to gilford which I did  made it out to where we went last weekend the fishing was great, the best perch action this winter  I took some videos of my underwater camera, now it is my camera taking a picture of the monitor of the underwater camera so it does lose some quality but I sure have fun watching the perch and maybe learning more about them   <object width=""425"" height=""344""><param name=""movie"" value=""    <object width=""425"" height=""344""><param name=""movie"" value="""
294179,Sandbag,2009-01-18 20:39:00,533,Very cool Terry...Thanks for putting that together.  I like the song in that first vid.  Cheers  Craig
294184,Bernie,2009-01-18 20:46:00,3190,Interesting video Terry. What surprises me is the amount of light at 30 ft under the ice. Or does the camera provide one?
294185,Terry,2009-01-18 20:52:00,14456,the light was turned off on the camera but they don't help much anyways that was just natural lighting
294201,Clampet,2009-01-18 21:47:00,1947,Finicky lil devils.
294202,misfish,2009-01-18 21:51:00,29133,"Darn that southern white ash anyway.LOL  Cool vids bud. Lots o fish,just aint hungry."
294206,Terry,2009-01-18 22:06:00,14456,"actually, they were biting like crazy  for a while I was seeing if I could keep them off the hook"
294243,irishfield,2009-01-18 23:14:00,26272,Pussy !   You made a smart move Bud. No problems and Krawler found me on the lake around 8:55. I plowed the laneway in anticipation of your arrival and came back to a good 6 inches in it again by 4PM. We couldn't see more than 400 feet on the lake so didn't move around much.  Good to see you salvaged the day.
294269,young_one,2009-01-18 23:59:00,620,"Ice Fishing with modern technology at its best! Congrad, and thank you for putting all this together."
294274,Leecher,2009-01-19 00:05:00,7832,Thanks Terry for posting those cool videos  Awesome Leechman
294277,DMASSE,2009-01-19 00:05:00,420,what kind of camera was that
294294,Terry,2009-01-19 00:33:00,14456,"wayne, sounds like a made a good decision turning back DMASSE, it's a Marcum  the pictures will be better when I figure out a way to record them"
294302,misfish,2009-01-19 00:40:00,29133,Did you hook Joey and Paul?
294336,Joey,2009-01-19 01:28:00,9122,"You made a good call Terry.  It was bad driving all day.  Cool videos.  Wish you could have at least made it to Innisfil, but better safe than sorry.  We saw a truck towing a trailer in that mess and the trailer started fishtailing wildly.  We couldn't believe it didn't crash or take anybody out with it.  He managed to gain control and kept driving in the fast lane  Joey"
294429,Terry,2009-01-19 02:53:00,14456,"another vid to show Misfish the perch were biting  <object width=""425"" height=""344""><param name=""movie"" value="""
294436,Joey,2009-01-19 03:07:00,9122,"That's great Terry.  The fish are kind of like, hey, where did he go, ha ha ha.  Hilarious.  Joey"
294677,Terry,2009-01-19 21:14:00,14456,you can really learn by watching the little buggers
294678,irishfield,2009-01-19 21:16:00,26272,Would have loved that camera yesterday Terry to see what we had below us 6 to 8 feet thick. We know perch for sure..but I suspect a school of herring rotating thru.
294681,Terry,2009-01-19 21:21:00,14456,yup when you can see lots of fish on the fishfinder but can't catch them the camera to see what it is sure helps
294702,tbayboy,2009-01-19 22:10:00,1497,"It's funny to see how unspooked the perch get - nothing seems to bother them ( at least until a pike comes flying in ).  Great vids Terry, gonna have to try doing the same with my camera if I ever get out there again - poor mans DVR option"
294725,Terry,2009-01-19 22:47:00,14456,"it hard to find something to record them on I know aqua vu make a dvr but they are not every well built  I have already had one die on me  I found something but I need to find a way to power it I need a 12v to 5 v power supply, then I will have a good recorder http://www.rjtech.net/product_detail.php?i...&parentId=1 I think it will work  "
294726,irishfield,2009-01-19 22:49:00,26272,A battery dip sh LOL  Take a little wind generator out there... it's always blowing on simcoe.
294902,ehg,2009-01-20 03:44:00,2666,"Great videos!  In the last video some of those perch seemed to be waiting for the lure, even after they watched others getting pulled out."
294920,snag,2009-01-20 04:24:00,1932,"Very cool Terry!!  Perch are like fresh water piranha.  The tunes match the vid nicely.  That day was brutal (my parents live near there)  GOOD CALL  Cheers,  S."
294994,corvette1,2009-01-20 14:09:00,1765,awesome video terry looked like fun
