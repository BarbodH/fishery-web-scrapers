294652,johnnyb,2009-01-19 20:01:00,3413,"That's awful...I wonder if there is any liability to the person who's hut it was...being that it was partially submerged I wonder if that is considered a hazard they should have dealt with?  Even though it happens every year, it's still terrible to read about."
294663,Beats,2009-01-19 20:37:00,543,Too bad.  It's fairly dark by 6:00 and I'm sure speed was a factor.  Should be interesting to see if the hut owner has anything to say.
294668,trophypikehunter,2009-01-19 20:56:00,89,"There is a half sunk hut in the southeast corner of the bay its been there for a few years now if thats the same one, no numbers on it..Sad story..."
294744,ecmilley,2009-01-19 23:22:00,2163,"to bad, my condolences to the family, as much fun as snowmobiling is it's way to easy to outrun you headlights at night on a lake, I would say it gets tough to stop quickly at anyspeed over 80km/h for object on the lake. there is also body armour called tek-vest I would recommend to anyone using sleds and atvs"
294754,Sinker,2009-01-19 23:32:00,8692,"Yep, put that sled to the bar for  a couple seconds and your doing 70 MPH easily. Do it at night, while its snowing, on a trail you haven't riden.....asking for trouble. It happens too much.....  Sad story.  Sinker"
294776,Clampet,2009-01-19 23:58:00,1947,"If that thing was left there, wouldn't that be considered a hazard, and begging fer a lawsuit?"
294778,Sinker,2009-01-20 00:00:00,8692," If it was registered, it would for sure.  Pretty hard to track down the owner with no numbers on it.  Sinker"
294876,ciceri,2009-01-20 03:08:00,535," i wear a tek-vest, it was $230 new, you'd think it would be uncomfortable? but no, you cant even notice it and just adds to your warmth."
294980,tinbanger,2009-01-20 13:45:00,1028,"As stated that huts been there ( if its the one I'm thinkin of) for several years . Sitting on 2-3 feet of wAter so I guess its not considered a hazard to navigation . Sorry to hear about the accident , but speed and bad visibility is a bad combination.  TB"
