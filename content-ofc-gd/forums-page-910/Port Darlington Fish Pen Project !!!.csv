293878,Roger_Dodger,2009-01-18 02:23:00,9,I am happy to hear that the wheels are turning for this project in Darlington...  we're excited about Dalhousie's own pens coming soon
293885,jwl,2009-01-18 02:33:00,1056," That's awesome, I already offered a long time ago while it was still in the 'thinking stage"" to lend a hand on the Port Dalhousie Pen project..it's great news for that area. I look forward to talking to a few of the people involved in the project at the St Catherine's G&F when I go down toward the end of the month.  I am going to be the guest speaker that day to talk about my involvement the last couple years with the MNR in a walleye tagging/relocating/rearing/stocking project I am involved with.  I am hoping to learn more about the pen project and also looking forward to just connecting a bit more with another local club so that perhaps down the road we may be able to work together on projects, perhaps start a new one, and really just raise some more awareness to some who may not know just what sort of programs the clubs are into, and perhaps just promote a bit more that all the areas conservation-game& fish clubs should network with eachother when volunteers  are needed and such.  great going. must be some great news for you guys in the Darlington area"
