Last year my sister went so I guess that I will have to suffer and leave my wife and kids at home and go   .  I have never thought about this, but I am thinking that I will couple of rods and some tackle down with us and try to do some shore fishing with my dad in the mornings but I have no idea as to what to bring as in rods and reels and tackle, help please!  Also what should I be spolling the reels with?  Any suggestions will be really helpful, oh and know I could do a charter but I dont want to do that.  Help please,  Thanks you,  FLEX - John"

Get some jigs, use half a shrimp and you should have no problems catching fish (if they are there)  This is the setup my oldman and I use when we shore fish in Florida.  Haven't been snapped off yet.  Might also want to use a Flouro leader."

Shrimp should be perfect, but a few silver spoons and Rapala X-raps will get you some of the larger predatory fish (if there are any around that is)  Be sure to rinse your reel after use to make sure that saltwater doesn't cause too much damage!"
