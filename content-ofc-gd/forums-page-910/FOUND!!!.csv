294707,holdfast,2009-01-19 22:21:00,1813,"Its been three hours, its yours now."
294931,floatman_mike,2009-01-20 05:36:00,14,its mine  .. its a rod about yay long {-----------------------------------------------------------) and the reel spins in one direction and its the colour i choose when i bought it
294968,forrest,2009-01-20 13:32:00,1032,"I can't imagine how someone forgets their fishing rod.  take it to the cops, some kid might be looking for it.  A cynical adult won't bother checking with cops.  I think you get it if unclaimed for 30 days right?"
295005,johnnyb,2009-01-20 14:31:00,3413,Also might be a good idea to call the local baitshop and have them put the word out....this has worked before in similar situations....
295042,Bondar,2009-01-20 16:28:00,817,"Baitshop knows ! As far as the cop thing goes im not running all over town in hopes of finding an owner ,   I have better things to do its posted on 3 websites and notified marina owner if that doesnt work buddy is outta luck"
