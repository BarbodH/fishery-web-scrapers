Here ya go bud.  First I chopped up some green/red peppers and a white onion and 10 gloves of garlic.Added to the pan and fried til tender to the touch.  The I added a pound of ground turkey  Then it was time for the stewed chillie tomatoes   Once they had got happy for about 15 minutes or so,it was time for the sweet snap peas   Now to add the rice    Into the backing dish and generously sprinkle the parmassian  Pop into the oven for 45 minutes   When done,you add some fresh vine grown toatoes sliced and there you have a nice hearty and healthy dinner.    Enjoy.  Sunday, I,ll try and do a boiled dinner  play by play aswell,with a nice roasted chicken. If you cant get the salt beef,I,ll send a bucket down to ya. Oh wait,they dont let that stuff pass the boarder.LOL"
