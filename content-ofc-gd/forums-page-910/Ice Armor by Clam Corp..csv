293567,Fishnwire,2009-01-17 14:07:00,983,"I'm thinking about ordering a suit of ""Ice Armor"" from Clam.  Does anyone have a set?  I'm curious about two things; first of all, I'm 5'10"" 180 lbs and carry a pretty decent gut...I was thinking XL for the coat and maybe XXL for the pants.  Is anyone familiar with how they size?  Also, I notice that something called Ice Armor Extreme is available.  Is anyone aware of what the differences are, and whether or not its worth the extra $100 or so?  Thanks."

294691,jerdog,2009-01-19 21:52:00,39,the stuff is GREAT -- extreme kept me warm in -30 weather.  It's also waterproof.  I'm about the the same size at tbayBoy and I was wearing a large.  Room for a couple of layers underneath but not too bulky.  US sizes tend to be a bit larger.  The new SnoSuit (not sure if it is Clam Corp) is pretty wicked stuff too.
