294468,OhioFisherman,2009-01-19 04:11:00,6623,"Mike a plug-in kind of deal, usually had around 8 in the boat and used 4-5, a couple-few, spares? Easier to pick up a different rod in a tournament than spend time fixing a problem.  Different bodies of water, different tackle? On Erie I could get by with a couple medium action baitcasters, and a couple spinning reels. Didn`t really need heavier gear no flipping to speak of, no junk in the water, but with my boat weather conditions (rough) could always be a problem so the game plan could change to moving into the rivers or bays and targeting largemouth in the junk. A flipping stick is a better tool for that job, medium heavy rods, heavier line.  Inland lakes here have a lot of junk, wood, docks, weeds, just plug different rods in the boat, not a lot of call for me to use a spinning rod on an inland lake here, but usually one or to if the game plan changed and I needed to downsize baits. I would cast crappie tubes for bass if the bite was tough and a spinning rod is better suited for that.  I keep most at home in school or industrial style lockers when not in use. Some are too long, 7'6"" one piece to fit in the lockers.  Some people hang in bars, tackle stores were more of an interest to me, and if I saw a deal I would buy it. I paid like 20 bucks a piece for my Shimano Convergence rods, they were on sale and I had cash? No problem for me to buy 4 or 5. Just never was to interest in 100 dollar + rods, I got one that costs over 90 and it is a special deal, a flipping stick (Falcon) designed for a spinning reel. Never had much trouble catching fish with the gear I bought, never had much of a problem with it.  Feel is the deal for me, rod don`t feel right I don`t spend money on it, bunch of different brands all felt good to me. Just busy a lot easier for me to plug in rods than take time changing line and stuff."
294475,Cudz,2009-01-19 04:41:00,2652,Flippin and pitchin is done much more effectively with a baitcaster.  Especially when you are pitchin to structure where you need to be accurate (sometimes you only get one shot).  It is hard to accuratly pitch a spinning reel and stopping the line slowly.  Not nearly as accurate and the lure will often hit the water much harder which in some situation is not beneficial.  Generally speeking baitcasting reels have much smoother drag systems than spinning rods as well.
294712,pike slayer,2009-01-19 22:29:00,1177,"ya i realise the advantages with a baitcaster, thats why im looking to buy one. i just know what certain ones are and what i should be looking for in a rod/reel other then finding the biggest price tag for the best gear. i think im gonna keep my eyes open on ebay and get a high quality used one for a dirt cheap price. also how does the 1piece and the 2 piece really differ? does it make that much of a difference? i've broken alot of rods and reels keeping them together and leaving them in the boat and getting bunched around and a 7foot rod will not fit in the cab of my truck where i normally keep my rods and it will get smashed around in the box of my truck. the one piece just seems that much more of a hassle and is it really worth the hassle? and thanks for the links fishing33k. also i stick with the recommended line sizes and lures and such with my rod and reels, im gonna be trying that power pro and its much thinner and those guide lines are more for using the thickness of the line not the test correct?"
294716,Raf,2009-01-19 22:33:00,3495,"yes thickness. so if you used 12lb mono, 50lb power pro is roughly the same diameter.  1pc rods to me, feel much more solid and offer better sensitivity.   other than my really long rods (8'6""+, everything is 1 pc).  you figure out a way to transport them.  i have a jeep cherokee and hang them from the ceiling of it using these straps you can get at BPS."
294777,diggyj,2009-01-20 00:00:00,548,"If you are looking for an entry level baitcaster thats'decent and not so expensive I would go with the Shimano Citica200E. It is a new model for 2009 and gos for about $140 at BPS.  I just got one for my birthday from the wife and am looking forward to trying it out this year. It was recommended by friends and staff at BPS for a entry level beginner baitcaster. I used one years ago, Shimano Black Bantam but always ended up with a birdsnest."
294399,holdfast,2009-01-19 02:15:00,1813," I guess I kind of look at the price and to me I can Jig fish with a Spinning reel, Cast Heavy plugs with a Spinning Reel, Top water with a Spinning reel and catch a Big Jack and Musky with a Spinning reel.  So whats the Big advantage?  I got two that I never use, even when I bassed fished."
294412,forrest,2009-01-19 02:39:00,1032," Not that I am an expert on bait casters.  They are not like cheap spinning outfits. I bet if you upgrade to a good baitcaster later you will dread ever having to use that CT bought one again.  Get used with an externally adjustable magnet feature for the first one.   For the rod I went with a Heartland $25 dipsy rod for salmon.....it was fun to use on the slamon At BPS I got a med/heavy BPS rod at 1/2 price....It is OK, no crying at $20.  I will replace with one that is more suited for whipping baits out.  forrest"
294421,Greencoachdog,2009-01-19 02:46:00,8163,"Once you fished with a 1 piece rod enough, you'll throw that 2 piece crap away!!!  ... the difference is like night and day!  A baitcaster can chunk and wind the heavier baits all day much better than a spinning rod can!!!  ... but when it comes to finesse, you can't beat a spinning rod!!!"
294438,OhioFisherman,2009-01-19 03:08:00,6623,Probably 30-40+ rods and I don`t think I own a two piece? A few telescoping flipping sticks.
294441,MCTFisher9120,2009-01-19 03:10:00,3761,How do you move them from place to place. I'm guessing you have a boat or a truck you can easily put them into.
294455,rbaquial,2009-01-19 03:28:00,968,"Here's my little portion on Baitcast Reels...  My 1st Baitcast Reel was a Shimano Sojourn (found  HERE ) At LeBarons for under $70 for the COMBO. I personally NEVER had ANY PROBLEMS with this particular combo for the 3years that I used it. (Other than the obvious BIRDNESTS) I also did quite a bit of research on the benefits of BAITCAST REELS and found   THIS LINK  and  THIS LINK to be pretty helpful. If you do a search on GOOGLE and type ""Baitcast +pros"" (without the quotations).. You'll have a good amount of results.  Here's what I find to be major benefits of using a BAITCAST REEL...  - Able to cast HEAVY BAITS/LURES with ease (Mostly why MUSKY/PIKE anglers use baitcast reels) - Casting distance increase is significant on BAITCASTERS (10-20yards; depending on how well your reel is greased/oiled and how easily the bearings roll) - Baitcasters are designed pretty much the same to that of a WINCH that is used to haul in a boat to the trailer (Hence why its usually preferred over Spinning Tackle when fishing for LARGE FISH) - SPINNING REELS ""Speed"" ratio is much slower than that of a BAITCAST REEL (Baitcast reels have a lot of variety) - The drag on SPINNING REEL isn't designed for long fights for big fish (Again, why BAITCAST REELS are usually used for LARGER fish; IE: Marlin, Tuna etc...)  A few pointers I should point out when learning to use the baitcast...  - BE VERY PATIENT (Trust me, in the end you'll LOVE using it) - If....err... WHEN you get a BIRDSNEST, I found a pretty cool ""TIP"" on the internet on how to quickly remove it found  HERE - The ""Specs"" you read on the ROD...or a ROD (IE: Lure Weight) needs to be followed; You can get away with this on SPINNING REELS; but on BAITCAST REELS its really hard NOT to get away with it - Others have said to ""GO BIG, OR GO HOME"" (IE: Spend the extra money on a 'Good' baitcaster); I would personally have to disagree with that only because I know there are several BAITCAST REELS that go under $100; for example the DAIWA MEGAFORCE is a good reel for its price. This was my 2nd reel, and THAT TOO did NOT GIVE ME ANY PROBLEMS - DO YOUR RESEARCH; Just because the REEL may LOOK NICE, its PERFORMANCE may FAIL YOU! (I usually read the ratings off BPS's website)  Anyway, in the end - You'll be happy with your BAITCASTER once you've learned how to properly use it. I find now that I'm using it about 90% of my outings. Hopefully I made this information a little ""Useful"" to you. Sorry for the yammering...  Rob"
294459,salmon,2009-01-19 03:42:00,334," Yep I use mine for everything, down from my 1/4 to my 7/8 oz lres. The only time I use a spinning reel is when I will cast my boys spinning setup.  Jose"
