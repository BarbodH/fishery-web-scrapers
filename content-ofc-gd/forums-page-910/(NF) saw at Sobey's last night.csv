294543,jwl,2009-01-19 15:06:00,1056,"headed out with the wife last night to ditch the kids for a few house and go to a friend's house to play some cards and have a few brews.   They asked if we could stop at Sobey's to pick something up for them on the way.    As I was walking down by the frozen food section what do I see in the box????? I was laughing and called my wife over, and telling her that ""now I have seen everything""..yepper you guessed it.... semi boneless Turducken   I couldn't believe it..want to know somehting else too...price was something like $69.99, now I wonder if they are actually going to sell many of those.  I wonder if they would mind if I sanpped a picture to share  I still think that is the funniest thing I ever saw for sale at a grocery store"
294546,Zubris21,2009-01-19 15:10:00,563,"I've never tried one, but I have friends who say they are delicious.  Our family used to get Hickens (ham stuffed chicken if no one could figure it out) and they were excellent.  a Turducken is definitely on my list of ""to try""."
294548,Rich,2009-01-19 15:13:00,3927,"Why is it funny?  Very, very popular Christmas item. We sold out this Christmas."
294552,jwl,2009-01-19 15:16:00,1056," just not something I thought I would ever see at a grocery store that's all..but not quite as funny as wehn my now 13 year old was a couple years younger, we where at the store and the meat dept. had rabbit and she hollers over to me.."" hey Dad, look at this, it looks like a wiener dog"".   And couple people started laughing when they heard her say that.  It was a ""had to be there thing"" but some other shoppers got a good kick out of it."
294587,daveboocock,2009-01-19 16:15:00,4,Hey Hey   As a Sobeys meat employee  the Turducken sells excellent at Xmas and throughout the year  If I remember I will take a picture of it and post it   Thanks  Boo
294608,Mike Pike,2009-01-19 17:26:00,1332,"Ok, I'll bite.  What's a turducken?"

294629,Guest skeeter99,2009-01-19 18:54:00,0,  no the duck goes in the chicken then the chicken in the turkey   and I have had 4 of them now more popular in the u.s. and they taste like crap  they may sell out cause of the curiousity factor
294648,solopaddler,2009-01-19 19:44:00,8605,"  This begs the question ""why didn't you stop after one then?"" LOL!  (Unless Dr. Frankenstein is my butcher I won't be trying one anytime soon  )"
294656,Marko,2009-01-19 20:11:00,854,"I had to google it myself, curiosity got the better of me hahah. Didn't look that great to be honest with you but to each his own lol"
294657,River Rat,2009-01-19 20:14:00,161,"Mmmm....meat stuffed with meat... stuffed with meat!  I've seen Pikeyes before,.... it was a Pike stuffing my Walleye down his toothy snapper!  RR"
294665,Guest skeeter99,2009-01-19 20:43:00,0,  cause when you are a guest at someones house you eat what they serve you not to be rude
294675,capt bruce,2009-01-19 21:11:00,820,"Turducken not extreme enough for you? Try the Fowl de Cochon (Pig Turducken) - a boneless pig stuffed with a Turducken (Turkey, Duck, Chicken, Cajun Sausage) and  cornbread dressing. Averages 50-60 lbs and feeds approximately 50-60 people.   the dimensions of the Fowl de Cochon measure approximately 36"" in length and 12"" around. This is larger than conventional ovens."
294706,misfish,2009-01-19 22:20:00,29133,"I just watched a show on the food channel last week. They did one from scratch. Very cool,but man thats alot of meat."
294720,Jigger,2009-01-19 22:41:00,1237,I wonder how long it would take on the smoker? The Fowl de Cochon sounds awesome.
294729,solopaddler,2009-01-19 22:55:00,8605,For some reason this popped into my head.........................the greatest threat that our planet faces..............the deadly........  MANBEARPIG!!!!     
294843,jjcanoe,2009-01-20 02:27:00,744,who would pay that much for half duck and half turd???? LOL Sorry but somebody had to say it!  jjcanoe
294913,Dozer,2009-01-20 04:00:00,896,MANBEARPIG!
294925,rbaquial,2009-01-20 04:49:00,968,"Yeah, the 1st time I heard of ""Tur-Ducken"" was on the FOOD NETWORK; I thought it was kinda weird too!!"
