Easy to see when going in and if you are over water when going out simply go through the back and out the side door. I bought my first boat last year and became good at it real fast.
294324,Bear,2009-01-19 01:09:00,106,Ahh hip waders best invention for self launching in cold water  :thumbsup_anim:
294376,Rizzo,2009-01-19 02:00:00,4754,"these guys don't know what they are talking about...nearly impossible to launch a boat like that on your own, better take me fishing with you"
294388,MuskyBill,2009-01-19 02:08:00,311,"Hey, I know that spot.....  "
293973,POLLIWOGG,2009-01-18 04:56:00,835,"If you use a long line to launch take it off the bow eye before getting under way, wash off the bow can pull the line into the water and it can end up in your prop. If you rig a permanent bow line make sure its not long enough to reach the prop. If you rig a bow line to the aft cleat you have a ready dock line and a legal boarding devise that can be grabbed from the water. A long line from the aft cleat around the far dock cleat and back to you can be used to control your boat and draw it to the dock.  A boat hook is handy when loading as its hard to push a boat with a dock line. Put the trailer in just far enough to line up the keel with the keel rollers so the boat stays straight when you winch it on, too far in and the boat floats all over and doesn't stay straight. Check out the ramp for hazards like a drop off at the end of the ramp or beach gravel piled up by power loaders before you launch. If its a roller trailer leave the winch strap or a safety line on till the boats in the water, you don't want the boat rolling off the trailer on the way down the ramp."
294020,pikehunter,2009-01-18 12:29:00,1659,"Lots of good suggestions already mentioned. I launch with a long line tied to the tower and back it in as Lew said. Tongue walk it and crank it in when reloading, but then my boat isn't as heavy as the pictured craft, but it is a 16' tinny.  What I find to be the 2 biggest factors to screw up a successful self launching is the wind and the ramp itself eg. depth, falloff, angle to the ramp and the ramp angle. Every boat ramp is different."
294021,tinbanger,2009-01-18 13:06:00,1028,"think its been covered pretty well  I tie to the winch tower back in till it floats off , then drive ahead S  L  O  W till the boat beaches on the ramp ( if no dock) or get out and secure to dock .  as Pikehunter noted some ramps can be an issue especially when reloading . unven ramps , current , too steep , too shallow, ramp traction or lack there of. but so far so good , depending on the vehicle , boat size etc , decide BEFORE you launch if you think you can relaod and get out ore be prepared to get some help.Get to know your set up and what it can do ( tow vehicle ,trailer ,boat)  I have yet to get severly hung up launching a 17' ft boat with 90 hp with my mini van . We launch in some ackwoods 'access points' and so far so good.  good luck and have fun out there.  One more thing when relaoding and pulling boat out .... RELEASE THE PARKING BRAKE ! ( my personel favorite)  TB"
294026,desship,2009-01-18 13:39:00,96,"I launch my princecraft alone all the time, just remember to tie off. Most times boat won't go far that rope will keep you from getting your feet wet should it."
294064,bigredfisher,2009-01-18 15:29:00,300,"i no look for some fishin buddies to take with ya, ....... ya you can bring bigredfisher......... pick me pick me pick me lol, i hope that  everyone answered your question, they are great people."
294073,limeyangler,2009-01-18 15:43:00,5204,I find having a pair of waders in the truck always a good idea....saves the balancing act on the trailer tongue.  SPLASH
