294118,steverowbotham,2009-01-18 17:39:00,1800,"With the lake being frozen up nice and tight we decided to try out a new area today.  Headed out to about 100 fow and dropped our lines. It was a pretty slow day but we still managed 3 lakers and 3 whities, not bad, not great.  Spoons were the ticket... not a sniff on live bait.  P.S. It was COLD!          "

294231,steverowbotham,2009-01-18 22:52:00,1800," It was a tough day all around it seemed.  Not many people getting fish, and even for us it was pretty tough, lucky to land a few.  Saw a ton of fish on the vex, but they were very unaggressive."
294249,irishfield,2009-01-18 23:27:00,26272,"""COLD"".. it was only -5C today... but I hear ya. I think it was the dampness and that darn wind today. Was out for 8 hours on GBAY and very easy, when only -5c, to work up a sweat,,, socks get damp quicker etc.. = cold later.  Some nice fish there Steve and crew. Another great outing."
