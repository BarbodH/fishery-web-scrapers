I'm really hoping some of the Extreme Team along with some of the OFNcommunitycan make it out.  Here is the e-mail I received when I got home a few minutes ago...   ""So on the 19thâ€¦ we are planning on being live at the Tiffin St boat launch in Barrie with our live truck from 6am-9am.  Weâ€™d love it if you could come for 7:30am and be live with Rob until 9am.  Heâ€™s live 4-5 more times for 3 minutes each from 7:30-9am  Simcoe Bait and Tackle is arranging an ice hut and various pieces of equipment for the show, they will be doing interviews from 6am and on.  If you could arrange for Tyler and his mom, yourself and a few xtreme anglers so we could do several segments with you guys, that would be great""  Let me know if you can make it....if you can't be sure to watch it or set up your PVR"
