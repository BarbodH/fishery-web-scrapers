A fantastic weekend, Sean Degagne runs the service and he and his wife took great care of us.  They were there about a half dozen times throughout the day with minnows, checking if we needed anything.  They took us out to deeper water to fish, stayed with us the whole time giving us pointers.  I would recommend them to anyone.  For the 2 days we were out there between 9 of us we caught a whole mess of perch, 4 whitefish and about a dozen eyes, mostly eater size.  From what I understand the fishing was a little slow this year compared to others (this was my first year, but others in the group have been doing this trip for several years) but was still a great trip.  Once again I would like to thank Sean Degagne for a great weekend."
