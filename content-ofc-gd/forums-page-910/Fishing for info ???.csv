294983,Beans,2009-01-20 13:48:00,3339,This is all I could come up with Jack  http://www.cra-arc.gc.ca/travelcosts/  Don't know if you need a separate form to clam these expenses or if there is a schedule included in the F-1 General form...?  Further:...expenses can be claimed on line 330 of the tax form.  also...meals/accomodation can be claimed...  If you can drive yourself it is all kms over 80 kms x 55.5 cents per km and only your meal can be claimed even if your spouse accompanies you but if she is with you because the doctor sez you need him/her to drive you home you could claim meals for both...then you would claim all kms over 40 kms x 55.5 cents per km  I hope this helps...
