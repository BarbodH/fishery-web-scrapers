294229,BillM,2009-01-18 22:48:00,17367,"Kemper, if I knew any Lake O tribs had some decent softwater, I'd be out!"
294230,Leecher,2009-01-18 22:48:00,7832, No way Kemp..... June is too late for me.... April is more of a comfortable month for me    But can't beat the hard water season for sure
294245,fishindevil,2009-01-18 23:18:00,6254,"Anytime i am in my LUND !!!!!!.  ...i just love getting up at like 3am,and heading out fishing,it doesnt matter for what species just to be in a boat,and to be all full of anticipation and hopes of getting a big ,big fish for the day !!! thats my crack for sure..LOL..LOL. cheers"
294258,Rich,2009-01-18 23:43:00,3927,"I can't possibly choose. I love fishing anytime, anywhere!"
294382,Rizzo,2009-01-19 02:05:00,4754,"with three little kids I don't get out much, so I put all my eggs in the October/November basket. Its those 2 months I get the majority of my fishing in"
294392,MCTFisher9120,2009-01-19 02:10:00,3761,"Summer is the best time for fishing in my opinion. Summer mornings and evenings offer amazing topwater success. If you have a boat u can cover lot's of water and it makes for easy travel. If it's cool out u bring a sweater, if it's warm u bring shorts. Fights are much better as you can see jumps and such. If you loose something in the water you have a fairly good chance of getting it back. And it is just better fishing, almost all of the species of fish are open during the summer. What is there not to like about summer fishing."
294586,BITEME,2009-01-19 16:10:00,1969,Not big on Hardwater fishing but in boat season as the sun comes up and about an hour before it goes down
294836,walleyemaster,2009-01-20 02:09:00,325,so far soft water is leading.. not to many hard water guys out there about 8 if your counting...
294838,Sinker,2009-01-20 02:20:00,8692,"But, hardwater anglers are twice the anglers as softwater, so make that 16  Sinker"
294842,Zubris21,2009-01-20 02:27:00,563,"  I agree, being out in the boat is great.  Although I don't have a boat so every opportunity is extra special.  Species doesn't matter so much, as long as your out there."
294919,brkygetr,2009-01-20 04:22:00,425, Your on the wrong lake
294993,tinbanger,2009-01-20 14:08:00,1028,"Soft water for sure.  Late september to early december would be the best , empty lakes , no bugs and potential to catch Muskie #2!  TB"
295142,Jigger,2009-01-20 23:57:00,1237,"First time the boat goes in at ice-out, is the best feeling! Getting on plane, hearing the motor whine. Can't help but feel at home! Summer mornings are good, spring days are good, just getting into ice fishing so the jury is still out on that one. Fall days probably my favourite overall time to fish. The air has cleaned up, no bugs and chance at a real big fish. Of any species."
295145,buckster,2009-01-21 00:06:00,530,I love being out on the ice....... Nothing like feeling your line stretch when you hook into  a nice laker or whitie in 80fow.  No bugs and its nice and fresh.... but it could be cause my sled is faster than my boat lol
293930,walleyemaster,2009-01-18 03:45:00,325,"whats your favorite time of the year to fish?  its been a few years now that ive come to realise that ice fishing for me has become my favorite fishing time of the year... even though i just purchased my dream boat 3 years ago.. yes i love the feeling of being on the open water with blue skies and having a cold one....yes it is nice real, nice..... i bought a new skidoo last year after having older used ones and yes this did also help me in making my decision about my favorite season...skidoos are awsome...so now i fly down the lake punch a few holes drop the vexilar look for fish and if theres no fish i move on and punch another hole untill i find them and then wait for the bite...""tight lines"""
293934,rickster,2009-01-18 03:52:00,495,I am kinda partial to that time between jan 1st and dec 31
293935,Sinker,2009-01-18 03:52:00,8692,I have to agree!!!  I LOVE my icefishing!!!  Sinker
293936,Leecher,2009-01-18 03:56:00,7832,I'd have to say hard water simply because I can go where ever I want to go.... Also the fact that there's no bugs around either Leechman
293937,BassAsin,2009-01-18 03:57:00,806,365 days a year from sun up to sundown dont really matter but the 4th saturday in june to Nov 30th! is my favourite time!!!
293938,walleyemaster,2009-01-18 03:57:00,325,i agree i forgot to mention that during the winter you can go from lake to lake through the bush ...cant do that with the boat
293941,irishfield,2009-01-18 04:03:00,26272," Well you can.. but it gets expensive.. !  I'm still fairly new to this ice fishing thing.. going into my 4th season... but give me a lightly overcast..80 *F August day.. out in the boat and I'm good. A bikini clad, female, deck mate even makes it better!"
293942,Greencoachdog,2009-01-18 04:06:00,8163,My favorite time to fish is when I get to the lake...  ... and I like to finish up just before I leave!   Open water 24/7/365 here!!!  No closed seasons and you can fish with 50 or more rods if you want (except for 2 lakes that have a 3 rod limit)!!!  ... does it get any better than that???
293944,OhioFisherman,2009-01-18 04:09:00,6623,"Never even tried ice fishing, too many nights on a cold truck dock, was even young and dumb once and came to work when it was 17 or 19 below zero back in the 70`s. I learned they gave us sick days for a reason! 25f balmy, 0F cold, anything below that doesn`t involve me!  Like my water like my wife, soft and warm! Fished in snow, rain, cold, ice season is tackle prep time. As much as I loved it there was a time and place for me, on the water, not ice!"
293947,jwl,2009-01-18 04:15:00,1056,"12 months a year..I avidly fish the Niagara in the cold months so there are always open water fishing options. Although the last few weeks have been less than favorable conditions, and this big cold snap has been kind of bad, I can't wait to get the boat out over the next while, soon as it warms up about 5-10 degrees..lol and the windchill staves off.  I do however have some hard water plans in the near future as well"
293990,the spirit of fishing,2009-01-18 05:48:00,141,"It's been an evolution. When I was a kid-anytime! As a young adult, many years back it was late winter and the fall for migratory L. Ont. rainbows. At some point I moved onto then out of ice fishing walleye locally. Salmon on L. Ont  in July held my interest for a number of years. Presently my favourite is May, after walleye opens locally and the trout are shallow and hungry in the north. I confess,however, I'm not very far removed from the kid who's favourite time to fish was anytime and look forward to my second childhood kicking in!"
294007,crappieperchhunter,2009-01-18 07:12:00,2582,Hardwater rules!!!! Fish 12 months of the year....but I do LOVE the HARD STUFF!!!  Dress warm.... and the rest is just plain fun.
294034,Moosebunk,2009-01-18 14:06:00,3970, I'm with postmaster Wayne on this one. lol.
294038,bigugli,2009-01-18 14:17:00,6138,Every different fishing season has it's ups and downs. I love it all year long.
294041,joonmoon,2009-01-18 14:28:00,528,"ICETIME ROCKS........C'mon it's the most fun you can have with 3 layers of clothes on....lol. No bugs, still fishin/jiggin without being blown by wind, relaxing in my chair, in the hut....can't beat it."
294052,limeyangler,2009-01-18 15:12:00,5204,"1st year i was here in Canada i would have said i like fishing on the ice and open water equally.  2nd year i found myself thinking about ice fishing whilst out in the boat, but would not admit to myself that i had a preference...because fishing is fishing.  Now into my 3rd hardwater season i would have to say i love icefishing....i think it just opens up where i can get to access wise, Lake trout are a lot easier to target, and i love catchin and eating those, and when i get better at finding and catching big walleye through the ice i think ice fishing wins!   But....lol...fishing is fishing....i love it all!"
294056,tibbs,2009-01-18 15:18:00,650,I prefer the soft water personally but then again i've never been on ice fishing before.
294068,silvio,2009-01-18 15:36:00,433,Ice fishing... something about being in a small portable really helps me relax.
294069,bigredfisher,2009-01-18 15:38:00,300,"i like ice fishing more than soft water, think about it this way. When you go in the boat you dont come into any contact with anyone else(cause you dont want to get too close, or they are flying around the lake). But when you get out on the ice everyone is there, now you are making friends and meeting new people(kinda hard in a boat) but i also like my spring stealhead opener too (but people tend to be a little rude and inconsiderate, ie... bomanville creek rape hole last year. ull no what i mean if you were there). i like to meet new people and that is why i get out fishing. I feel that is what fishing is all about right??????? guys answer this question i want your prospective on this.  thanks everyone  bigredfisher"
294072,BillM,2009-01-18 15:43:00,17367,"Softwater for sure...  How ice fishing can even hold a candle to top water smallmouth in June is beyond me.  Nothing beats waking up at 4am, hitting a dead calm lake and working a Zara spook over a nice shoal in 10-12ft as the fog burns off..  Not to mention my addiction to floatfishing...  I'd do it all year if I could."
294074,lunkerbasshunter,2009-01-18 15:45:00,2585,personaly i love the fall.  fishing while watching the colourful shoreline is awesome!  cheers!
294091,KelfuN,2009-01-18 16:07:00,246,"i would have to say the fall season. temperature is very confortable, and the beautiful scenary.  AND the fall steelhead runssss =D"
294146,profisher25,2009-01-18 18:54:00,185,"By far mid summer, to mid fall! I would say July to the end of October if my favorite time to fish, especially in the evening.. nothing beats a nice summer evening on the dock by your self.. you vs the fish, 1 on 1  ... thats my kinda' fishing!"
294155,pike slayer,2009-01-18 19:21:00,1177,i find both are pretty equal. i love just ripping across a lake with the sled and watching my lines go off and pulling a fish out of a hole. and in the summer on a nice day pulling in fish after fish you cant beat that. its all about going out there and having a good time getting away for a while and bringing home a few fish.
294159,kemper,2009-01-18 19:30:00,2232,"Funny, ask this question in june and I bet 50 percent of the people who chose ice would be saying softwater"
