775229,John Bacon,2013-03-22 22:11:00,3277, I don't think banning roe on the Ganaraska only would have much impact.  People would still harvest the roe to use on other rivers.  The ban would have to be province wide in order to have any impact.  There would be a lot of legitimate resistance to a province wide ban on roe to stop the slaughter of salmon.

I am however rather curtious and remove my salmon carcasses and ""dispose""'of them appropriately, and not riverside!  I also generally can avoid it as several friends are trollers, and usually have a guest or 2 that will keep August kings.  I get the skeins, so it cuts down on the unpleasantness of fishing them in the river.  I too was a big fan of cohos!  The last one I caught Ontario side in a river was probably 8 or 9 years ago.  Criticism of a program that has so far shown a rather large failure rate isn't ""dissing"" it is fair criticism.  I believe what I have said is fairly accurate.  If this program didn't have a lot of internal support in the MNR ie: it's someone's pet project, and they have some pull, something that has been so unsuccessful for so long would likely have been dumped.  Opinions are like you know what.... And that is my opinion.  In a relatively free country I am allowed to have one.

775287,craigdritchie,2013-03-23 11:59:00,1586," Nice romantic visions Captain Bruce, but let's face reality.  1. The majority of Atlantic salmon caught in Lake Ontario rivers show up in fall after there has finally been enough rain to raise their ditch-like water levels. By then, the fish are either approaching spawning condition, or in full spawning condition and loaded with eggs, just like the cohos and chinooks. By that point in time and in that cold water, they do not leap eight feet into the air, nor do they put on ""tarpon-like"" aerial displays (come on man, be honest. Have you ever hooked a tarpon? It's a whole other breed of cat). And yes, some Atlantics do get a bit of fungus on them just like the coho and chinnies. That's reality.  2. Atlantic salmon do not provide a spring fishery in the rivers - at all. It's strictly a September - November thing, then game over for the rest of the year.  3. Atlantic salmon don't provide a summer boat fishery - at all. I know in August and Spetember guys catch them from tinnies fishing the power outlet discharge in Sault Ste Marie, but that is not the same thing. I'm talking about supporting an offshore boat fishery, like coho, chinook and steelhead do.  Now let's compare to steelhead:  1. Fall steelhead are generally bright as a dime, right into January. They don't leap like a tarpon or come flying eight feet out of the water either, but fresh from the lake they fight every bit as hard as an Atlantic.  2. Steelhead provide a pier/river fishery from late August till mid-May, sometimes late May. Atlantics don't. So you get nine months of shore fishing for steelhead each year, and maybe two months and a bit for Atlantics. Steelhead provide way more bang for the buck.  3. No doubt Captain Bruce has fished the Blue Zone on Lake Ontario or Erie ..... and can confirm that steelhead provide an awesome  and dependable summer boat fishery. Not so for Atlantic salmon - anywhere in the world.  So why keep beating a dead horse that hasn't produced any results since 1985? Scrap the Atlantic program altogether and put those precious MNR resources on steelhead. You'll have a MUCH better fishery in 18 months. After all, DOESN'T MNR HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO THE ANGLERS OF ONTARIO WHO FUND THEM THROUGH THEIR TAXES AND LICENSE FEES????  WHEN CAN WE FINALLY GET SOME CUSTOMER SERVICE AROUND HERE, AND START SEEING VALUE FOR OUR DOLLARS?????  Our sport fishery on Lake Ontario has gone down the toilet and all we keep hearing are endless excuses.  People who say ""it takes time, we haven't waited long enough to see results yet"" really make me laugh. We've stocked Atlantics for 25 years, and still .... nothing. We've stocked a couple million in the past four years alone. Nothing.  When Ontario introduced coho to Lake Ontario in 1968, they stocked about 130,000 fish and had a wicked sport fishery in 18 months. Within four years, the number of boats on Lake Ontario skyrocketed. There were lineups at launch ramps, tackle stores did great business, hotels and restaurants were filled, and everyone was happy. Capt Bruce mentions the glory days of Lake Ontario coho fishing, and it's true - those were really good times for everyone.  Now, we stock half a million Atlantics each year and think great, maybe in 30 years maybe there might be enough of them out there I can legally fish for them in the river and expect to catch something. Because let's remember, right now it is absolutely ILLEGAL to fish for Atlantic salmon in Lake Ontario rivers.  That is, unless you are one of the special few who have one of those special permits that lets you fish in the sanctuaries and areas with closed seasons, but I digress.  When Ontario began stocking browns in Lake Ontario tributaries in the early 80s, there were good runs and great fishing for them within four years. Remeber those days, Captain Bruce? Yet after 25 years of Altantic stocking ....... nothing.  What does it take to get some people to face the facts and admit the Atlantic salmon program is a complete failure in every way?  I know the truth hurts, but enough is enough."
775304,Steve,2013-03-23 15:47:00,2075,"so many talk about only stripping salmon as they are half dying or dead. HOWEVER, 90% of rainbow anglers want to strip full living BROWN roe...  so give yourself a headshake if you think its only salmon that are being stripped.  remove the use of roe and remove the unnecessary carniage towards a species that IS NOT dying when they enter the rivers - only dies when their stomachs are ripped open from a lugan.  now we'll get guys chiming in that it is allowed as they are harvesting the fish part of their legal right - FINE. but don't speak like anglers are only stripping dead or dying chinooks."

775407,ch312,2013-03-24 17:33:00,1590,"   so you're saying it's okay to target spawning fish as long as someone is making money off of it? this mentality of river salmon being garbage fish and no good for nothing other than roe is what got us here in the first place. those who fish in lakes for the same fish also contribute huge amounts of money to the government and local economy.    if there were a complete ban on roe, those people would have no reason to strip 50-75 fish at a time because there would be no market for the roe they're taking.  there would be zero point in stripping eggs if nobody was going to buy them...   again, the mentality that river salmon are garbage fish has evolved over the years and it's not getting better. if they were left alone in rivers and were permitted to reproduce, would that not eliminate the need to stock them in the first place? i often wonder what the salmon and trout fisheries would be like across ontario if spawning fish were completely off limits.   isn't it odd that the species who are specifically targeted during their spawning migrations are the main ones who need stocking to keep fish able populations?"

774983,craigdritchie,2013-03-21 15:53:00,1586," The Port Hope town council needs to give its head a shake. It's already illegal to gut salmon and leave the carcass to spoil under the Ontario fishing regulations. If people are already ignoring a provincial law, then adding a new municipal bylaw on top of it won't make one bit of difference.  Instead of grandstand gestures like introducing new bylaws that have no teeth, what they need to do is enforce the laws that already exist. If the town is serious, then they should petition MNR or OPP to put some cops down there and write people up. Simple as that.  Of course that still won't do anything about the stench of hundreds of salmon that croak from natural causes. No bylaw will solve that problem. At least there aren't thousands of Atlantics adding to the problem :-)"
774984,craigdritchie,2013-03-21 15:57:00,1586," That's because we don't stock enough of them. 500,000 a year isn't enough."

774988,chessy,2013-03-21 16:18:00,610,Craig I think you need to re read the fish and game act the problem is people have read it and there interpretation of the law is  that the fish are not edible therefor you can alow it to spoil. I will not get into the debate but it has been confirmed that they are not edible as the moe has a book out and clearly states a salmon over a certain size is not edible for human consumption.  I personally do not agree with this but have been told there is little to be done other than charge them for depositing part of a fish on private property
774989,kemper,2013-03-21 16:35:00,2232," At the risk of a serious sidetrack (my apologies) there are thousands of the little buggers in the 4""-8"" range up in the headwaters... Do we know where the snag is? Are they not leaving like they should or simply not coming back? Dying in the lake? Cormorant food?  I wonder if our rivers are anywhere near healthy enough to sustain a spawning population of Atlantics...I'm all for restoring the fishery, but I don't believe dumping a million fish a year into a few rivers is going to do it."

I'd have to spend a bit more time to get the Ontario numbers by themselves.  Here is the link to the database: http://www.glfc.org/fishstocking/  Jon  "

775056,craigdritchie,2013-03-21 22:08:00,1586," Not to hijack the thread, but .......   Jon,  Yes, we all know more chinooks have been stocked into Lake Ontario than Atlantics, simply due to the fact Ontario has been throwing Pacific salmon into the lake for 20 years longer. But it's not like any of those fish are still out there, so let's not confuse the issue with historical totals.  Instead, let's compare apples to apples. For the past several years the number of Atlantic salmon and the number of chinook stocked in the Ontario side of Lake Ontario each year has been roughly the same, at about a half-million each. And, they're stocked at approximately the same size. I see lots and lots of chinooks out there, and almost zero Atlantics.  The Lake Ontario Atlantic salmon program is a complete and total flop. The sooner we admit as much, the sooner we can put valuable resources back to managing fish that actually exist and provide a fishery, like steelhead, browns, and Pacific salmon."
775064,Harrison,2013-03-21 22:31:00,2202,"I've fished Duffins basically my whole life, same with my bro and more then a few friends. I have yet to hear of a true Atlantic caught in the river.  But I guess for $250,000 the weir on Duffins will let us know how many there are in that river.  Those resources alone would cover approx.one CO's salary/benefits for 4 years.  OR put that $250k into steelhead stock or better yet... Cohos"
775066,Steve,2013-03-21 22:34:00,2075,all of this nonsense talk...praise atlantics!  if we can allow just one river fisherman to cach just one atlantic - it will all be worth while.  ugh.
775071,danjang,2013-03-21 23:00:00,148,"We see a a lot of chinooks because they have very good natural reproduction rates. Not only do you see stocked fish, but also wild.  The atlantics have not yet had time to establish themselves. It will be slow, but provided that the rivers remain the same, they should be able to thrive once again. I've personally seen and caught a few grilse on the credit. They are returning.  In order to create a fishery, time is required to investigate what strains work best. Stocking in large quantities gives a better idea of what the atlantics are doing and research what can be adjusted to ensure their success.  Not 100% sure, but I don't think Bowmanville is part of the current atlantic salmon program. If you caught any, they might have been strays!  Let's also not forget that this stocking program wasn't made just for fishermen. It's a natural heritage project regarding a game fish."

775129,John Bacon,2013-03-22 04:11:00,3277," Are you saying that the atlantics being stocked are the same size as the chinooks being stocked?  That is not true in most cases.  All chinook are stocked in the spring from eggs collected in the fall.  Atlantics are stocked at various stages in their life cycle.  Some yearlings are stocked and those fish are likely similar size to the chinooks being stocked.  However, most atlantics are stocked at a much earlier point in their life cycle; some still have their yolk sack when they are stocked.  This needs to be taken into consideration when comparing the numbers of atlantics stocked to other fish being stocked in the lake.  Chinook are stocked to create a fishery, and stocking larger fish is the best way to do this.  Where as atlantics are being stocked to establish a self sustaining population.  The findings from the MNR is that stocking younger fish will lead to better imprinting, ensure that fish can winter over in the rivers, and is better for producing a self sustaining population of fish.  Since chinook are managed as a put and take fishery, imprinting and the ability to survice the entire life cycle in the wild are less important."
775142,porkpie,2013-03-22 10:22:00,2521,"The Atlantic program is an utter failure, and has little angler support from my unscientific polling.

775178,Jon,2013-03-22 15:43:00,209,Here is some more info on the Atlantic Salmon Monitoring in the Credit: http://www.glfc.org/lakecom/loc/mgmt_unit/index.html See Pages 50 - 56 in the 2011 report and Pages 49 - 56 in the 2012 report.  Craig - I don't agree that the historic information is irrelevant. Many of the Chinooks showing up every year are wild fish and they wouldn't be around if it wasn't for stocking over the last 30 or 40 years.  Jon
775188,ch312,2013-03-22 16:50:00,1590,"time to play devils advocate...  salmon dying and nutrients going back into the circle is 100% natural. but, there is nothing natural about salmon carcasses being stripped and dumped anywhere from a couple to hundreds of feet from the riverbanks and salmon carcasses tossed into garbage cans serve no purpose other than stinking up the area. i think educating people about the benefits of leaving the carcass near or in the water would help solve the issue of residents complaining about the smell. the carcasses belong in or near the water. take the roe and leave them there if you're not going to eat it.  a ban on roe would definitely help with the carcasses being littered everywhere and would definitely lower the number of fish that are taken. it seems like the majority of people i speak with who are fishing for salmon on the rivers are steelheaders looking for free roe and could care less about salmon as they're only interested in killing one species to catch another. if there were a ban on roe many people would have no reason to target salmon as it seems like most are after roe, not meat. a ban would likely stop greedy people from killing multiple fish to load up on roe and would also curb most poaching as nobody would have a use for the roe the poachers take every year.   that said, does anyone have a good reason why we're allowed to target these easily caught and snagged spawning fish, yet most other species are off limits when they're spawning in wide open lakes?  "
775196,chessy,2013-03-22 17:52:00,610,Because by doing so it stimulates more people to fish and buy licences . A lot of these people would not fish for salmon in fall if they could not keep roe or fish .
774756,16sailor,2013-03-20 15:17:00,38,Anyone heard this yet by law passed no roe in the ganny http://www.star933.net/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=5559:no-more-fish-eggs&catid=1:local-news&Itemid=56#.UUnS5_q9LCS
774760,chessy,2013-03-20 15:39:00,610,Wow I was at the meeting last night and the town can not ban the use of roe in port hope they wanted to send a letter to the mnr for the ban on wild roe I explained that there is no diffence between wild an hatchery fish. It is not the mnr call it is the fisheries act which is federal
774765,BillM,2013-03-20 15:59:00,17367,"Yeah, nothing to get all excited about...   If it's a federal regulation, then you've got something to worry about."
774768,chessy,2013-03-20 16:17:00,610,When they implement the municiple fishing licence that's a whole new bucket of fish. It's on there radar and 100percent enforcible
774771,solopaddler,2013-03-20 16:24:00,8605,Cue Snidely jumping on his bed and laughing maniacally.
774775,Harrison,2013-03-20 16:38:00,2202,".......complete waste of time as the moeny it will take to administer this will far out weigh the money generated from licenses!  Heck, staff resources to write the policy will put this plan deep in the hole to before it even gets of the ground!  I think there is a typo, I fixed it."
774778,BillM,2013-03-20 16:46:00,17367, LOL!!!!!!!!!!
774780,bigugli,2013-03-20 16:54:00,6138,NOTL went that route a few years back.
774792,torco,2013-03-20 17:43:00,656,How would one know if the roe was wild or from a hatchery? Seems like a bylaw that is hard to enforce.  I am a little confused which part falls under Federal Jurisdiction?  Couldn't the MNR just ban organic baits if they wanted too on the river?.
774793,esoxansteel,2013-03-20 18:09:00,1307,"According to the posted letter, its about slob fisherman dumping fish carcasses whether its salmon or steelhead etc into garbage cans after the roe has been removed, leaving the fish to rot, or for the township to cleanup. If thats the case the idiot fishermen created there own mess, and ive personally seen the dead carcasses esp salmon littlered on the shore with bellies slit open and roe removed. Certain individuals give passionate steelheaders a bad name and reputation, but the problem lies in enforcement or lack there of. As its against the law to let fish spoil, so a little visiblity from the MNR would solve the issue, and the charges layed would generate some revenue to help fund infrastructure, or social services, or open another methadone clinic LOL God forbid that revenues generated from fishing be used on fishing."
774828,chessy,2013-03-20 20:26:00,610,"Liverealese  I know. From what I have been told there were 3 phone calls to mnr tips Line about people fishing above bridge and keeping fish  none of those tips have had follow ups by mnr. Same guy called about a walleye taken out of season  he had a call back in less than 24 hours, same WMu same officer covers those areas so it shows where their priorities lie"
774830,Garnet,2013-03-20 20:28:00,2056,"Most likely the town looking at the $ to maintain the fish cleaning station. When the salmon run the river the town guys are making 2-3 trips a day .  Like every town they only see cost, they never look at benfits.  That's why it so important when you are buy services in Port Hope or any town you are fishing that you are here for the fishing."
774833,chessy,2013-03-20 20:44:00,610,"2100 kg from Friday am to Saturday at noon of fish carcusus to the dump in fall salmon run  they are tring to put bylaw in place so only place to clean fish is either at your own home or at the FREE fish cleaning station and it will remain FREE they  would rather pay the cost to take to dump then to pay cost to clean carcusus and fish guts from the stream ,as well is to stop the smell"
774845,porkpie,2013-03-20 21:24:00,2521,When has that ever stopped a municipality???? LOL
774851,16sailor,2013-03-20 21:50:00,38,Have they forgotten that salmon die after the spawn and there dead carcasses feed the rivers
774868,Canuck2fan,2013-03-20 22:44:00,1444," See now you just made the classic mistake we all make when trying to fight city hall. You have went and confused the ISSUE with facts and logic, and from past experience as right as you are it probably will fall on deaf ears...."
774872,bigugli,2013-03-20 22:53:00,6138,Sound environmental sense cannot stand against the demands of residential ratepayers. You should hear the whining down here that we get whenever the wind carries the heady aroma of fresh spread fertilizer into the subdivisions
774878,16sailor,2013-03-20 23:40:00,38,I wonder if we need to get a fish biologist down to the porthope city council and explane the life cycle and that if they continue to remove the dead fish they are actually killing the future fish.
774888,Garnet,2013-03-21 00:24:00,2056,Think we need to get back to op and why town council thinks it would be good to band natural roe in favour of hatchery roe.  Theirs is a couple fish farms north of town that would like more sales. Are these people on town council.
774894,BillM,2013-03-21 00:44:00,17367, They want to ban roe because they think it will somehow stop the slaughter of fish and reduce the amount of stinky fish carcasses all over the place.  Boy are they wrong.
774908,chessy,2013-03-21 01:58:00,610,"yes they are wrong to think banning roe will stop the stench , and yes they know the life cycle of the salmon. what most dont understand it is guys that realease the salmon in 2 inches of water and walk away and leave it there to die or people gutting salmon on the banks taking eggs and leaving carcuss to spoil. the only way to stop it is to do a bylaw to stop the gutting of fish on the river bank and make the fine high two or three people charged the word gets out quick"
774922,John Bacon,2013-03-21 03:20:00,3277," No, only the federal government can do that."
774925,kemper,2013-03-21 03:51:00,2232,"It would be absolutely hysterical to see a CO try to decipher between hatchery and wild roe.  A roe ban wouldn't bother me, personally. It also wouldn't do anything to stop the slaughter.  It's not the law-abiding anglers that come in at night and slit 50-100 fish (males and females)."
774941,Garnet,2013-03-21 11:35:00,2056,"As always theirs the law about wasting fish. On the books for years, it just needs to be enforced.  So we will make a by law to ban natural roe and send a by law officer down to the river to work under cover.  Just another well thought out plan. The guy with a gun can't get the job done so we will send the parking ticket cop."
774944,Harrison,2013-03-21 12:41:00,2202,"The MNR is spending $250,000 on a weir for Duffins Creek to count fish (i.e Atlantics)  That is a lot of money that should go into the enforcement budget. IMO  Speaking of enforcement.  My understandning is NY State does not fin clip their stocked fish.  Bylaw folks will have to take scale samples."
