777813,Slayingm,2013-04-05 23:58:00,204,After ice fishing every weekend since the last one of December 2012 I can finally get some various video coverage together. The ice fishing this season has been awesome both for conditions and action and the late March action for Big Jumbo Perch on Lake Simcoe was no exception. I found groups of Big prespawn females in hard  bottom area's in 22-30 ft of water that were feeding on both Gobies and crayfish. The underwater portion of this video was taken with the  Sony HD underwater camera that comes with the Marcum LX-9 and was shot in 27ft of water.
