778056,MSBruno,2013-04-07 11:23:00,369,"All,  Due to work contraints, I prefer to leave my boat in a marina which would allow me to drive to, hop on and start fishing.  Also, having it close to home would allow me to pick up the rig and take it to other bodies of water if I choose to.  Picking up a new rig (18' Princecraft, 115 Opti) and looking to leave it in Simcoe.  I'm from Vaughan and common sense to me would be Cook's Bay Marina or the like, closer to home, but I am not sure if the bass fishing would be best.  The last thing I would like to do it run 30km's every day to the best bass fishing holes.  I understand SImcoe is Simcoe and the 6lb smallies are everywhere, but I am limiting myself by choosing the wrong marina location?  If you do not wish to share spots/thoguhts publically, please feel free to PM me.  Thanks in advance, Mark"

The largemouth are good down that end,also Pike(big ones).A few minutes gets you out to a couple nice islands, and put you into some pretty good smallmouth areas. His marina cost for the season was very reasonable."
778062,MSBruno,2013-04-07 11:50:00,369,"I love my largies and this is why I am leaning towards Cook's, but I'm thinking I can't go wrong anywhere on Simcoe .... or could I?"
778065,davey buoy,2013-04-07 12:21:00,5505,"Probably not but finding a marina doesn't mean you'll get a spot.Two years ago I checked in with Brentwood,and even if I could afford to keep it there I was like #35 in line and approx. a 5-10 year wait lol. Just sayin!"
778078,SirWhite,2013-04-07 13:48:00,210,There is a Marina in Gilford and two in Lefroy.
778279,cityfisher,2013-04-08 15:38:00,959,id stick with the bunch of marianas in the maskonage in Keswick... Coves of keswick will be the cheapest but likely full. I had my boat there for 7 years!!
778281,Harrison,2013-04-08 15:56:00,2202,"I'd go Keswick area.  Cooks bay right there and good smallies with in a 1/2 hr run.  Good area when it gets rough too, you can still get out fishing."
778305,davey buoy,2013-04-08 19:05:00,5505,"Your right,not many days you can't get out"
