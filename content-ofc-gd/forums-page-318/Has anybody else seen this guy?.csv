Since the beginning of the project on Oct. 1, 2008, 19,500 portraits from every province and territory in Canada have been created by photojournalist Tim Van Horn. Every year until 2017, Van Horn will traverse the Canadian cultural landscape, photographing thousands of Canadians, meticulously recording each individual story. Van Horn and his van will be travelling around Barrie's downtown and the waterfront on Monday, April 8, snapping photos. This project attempts to unite the country, a people, in one single all encompassing, euphoric visual. Each one of us has a story to tell and to share. The Canadian Mosaic project brings our unique, interconnected stories together into one spell-binding visual. The Canadian Mosaic project’s mission is to create an astonishing 36,000 portraits. This number represents a seemingly miniscule .1% of the population of Canada but it will be the most comprehensive portrait ever created on the Canadian people. The collective story of these 36,000 portraits will converge and weave together a spectacular, ‘prism of life:’ shining a spotlight on the meaning of life. On Canada Day in 2017, for Canada’s 150th birthday, a larger-than-life 30x100 foot Canadian flag mosaic will be unveiled at a major Canadian museum. This living tapestry of life, will play an instrumental role to bring together the people of Canada.  The task at hand is to focus, gather and define the sentiment of the Canadian people across the gamut of Canadian society: from all regions, inclusive of all ethnic/socioeconomic groups, sub-cultures and generations.
