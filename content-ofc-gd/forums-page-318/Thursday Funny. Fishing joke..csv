""We're sorry Mr. Wilkens, but we have some information about your wife,"" said one of the troopers.  ""Tell me! Did you find her?"" Wilkens asked.  The troopers looked at each other. One said, ""We have some bad news, some good news, and some really great news. Which would you like to hear first?""  Fearing the worst, the ashen Mr. Wilkens said, ""Give me the bad news first.""  The trooper said, ""I'm sorry to tell you, sir, but this morning we found your wife's body in Kachemak Bay.‚Äù  ""Oh my God!"" said Wilkens. Swallowing hard, he asked, ""What's the good news?""  The trooper continued, ""When we pulled her up, she had 2-twenty pound King crabs and 6 good-sized Dungeness crabs clinging to her, and we feel you are entitled to a share in the catch.""  Stunned, Mr. Wilkens demanded, ""If that's the good news, then what's the great news?""  The trooper smiled and said, ""We're gonna pull her up again tomorrow.""  Hey, fishing is fishing !"
