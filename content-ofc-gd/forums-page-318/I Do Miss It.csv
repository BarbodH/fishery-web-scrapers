Yet while I'm whipping slip floats at crystal clear spring ponds, the thought creeps into my head of summer time. T-shirts, no shirts, drop the inflatable in wherever we please that day.. oh yeah and the sweet prizes at the end of the season, the memories of fish like this, and many many more.  "
777460,Locnar,2013-04-04 00:43:00,645,"Damn, nice bass. I'm waiting patiently, since apparently patience is a virtue, for the summer."
777481,GarageDoorGuy,2013-04-04 01:52:00,10,Sweet Bass bud! What did you get it on?
777487,Dave Bailey,2013-04-04 02:07:00,1641," Judging by the background, I'd say a lake."
777488,Rich,2013-04-04 02:09:00,3927,"Spinnerbaits in the stumps, the harder the crash, the harder the smash! That day I landed 3 over five pounds, it was probably my best day of bass fishing ever. That fish was on the wire at 6lbs, was the first and biggest of the day."
777492,Old Ironmaker,2013-04-04 02:18:00,8243,"Judging by the pic could be a river.  You didn't get that baby on the Lynn, or maybe you did! Great bucket kid."
777508,Rich,2013-04-04 10:29:00,3927,  I believe you and I have discussed this river via PM ..
777513,Headhunter,2013-04-04 12:50:00,5703,"Nice bass BBR... I for one, was expecting a pic of you without your shirt one, based on your text... thanks for not posting that! HH"
777525,glen,2013-04-04 16:13:00,2641,Return of BBR.
