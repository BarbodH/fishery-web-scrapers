657065,mike rousseau,2012-01-16 16:30:00,4661,come on april...  hoping its an early spring this year...  i got a rolling table to make some boilies and some dyes and flavors as well...  i wanna get a 40 pounder this year...
657258,hammercarp,2012-01-17 00:57:00,964,Thanks Mike and Mike good luck on your quest for a forty. You have the waters for it.
657297,bigugli,2012-01-17 03:33:00,6138,"We've got the waters for a 40 in our area too, Lorne."
657360,hammercarp,2012-01-17 14:05:00,964,"I totally agree with you Bruce. Although I have not broken 40 yet myself , I do know some guys that have."
657364,mike rousseau,2012-01-17 14:15:00,4661,You guys should come this way for a weekend carpin trip....  It's easy fishing and big fish (20lb average)... The most important thing in my area is choosing the best spot for the conditions on a given day...
778470,hammercarp,2013-04-09 14:16:00,964,I thought I would add some more to this thread further explaining this system of fishing carp.This will also give those that haven't had a chance to look it over. Here is a reprise of the basic rig. Paylake Rig for beginners
778471,hammercarp,2013-04-09 14:19:00,964,Here is a slide show I put together showing how to make and fish some basic baits. You can click on the YouTube logo and then click on the icon beside it to expand the video to full screen to make reading the text easier. 
778482,cuzza,2013-04-09 15:13:00,467,This has to be one of the most informative threads on here - great job Lorne!  FWIW I use the same up to the swivel but use braid (power pro) and a hair off the shank of the hook. Works well in clear water when you want the bait to move naturally - anything that doesn't behave right when they suck at it gets rejected.  Need to find one of those forties when I've got my fly rod with me (the one in my avatar was taken on it)  - that would be fun!!
561343,MJL,2011-03-13 15:19:00,2427,"Finally had some time to read the tutorial Lorne.  Well written  It gave me a lot of memories of how I grew up carp fishing with similar tackle and rigs.  As a kid, I spent a ton of time in the Kawarthas with an Abu C3 and an 8'6"" or 10' med-med/heavy salmon/steelhead rod for my stalking sessions.    I think there would be a lot more people fishing today if they really knew how easy it can be to catch carp.  You aren't limited to using 12ft specimen carp rods or baitrunners or method feeders or hair rigs...In many cases, unless you really understand why you're using them, they detract from the learning experience."
561370,mbosh1980,2011-03-13 16:29:00,349,"Awesome! I just picked up a 8'6"" uglistik to pair with the abu I was using towards the end of last season. But to reiterate beans, how do you tie it with the curve in the hooklink?"
561390,Live2fish85,2011-03-13 17:34:00,1633,Hey thanks for the advice I will try that out this spring on Lake Erie when the waters rises a bit.
561391,splashhopper,2011-03-13 17:42:00,2931,Excellent tutorial Hammercarp.....  thank you for taking the time and effort to put it all together for us.
561476,hammercarp,2011-03-13 23:00:00,964,"Yes Michael you nailed it squarely on the head. As a chairman of a carp club here I am dedicated to the growth of carp angling. I reached the same conclusion as stated by you some while ago. That the european style 12 ft. rod with all it's attendant bells and whistles was probably a bigger hindrance to that goal than anything else. To quote someone whom we both know and whom I have gotten a lot of chuckles from. "" It's easy to catch carp. It's a lot harder to catch them properly."""
561504,cuzza,2011-03-14 00:25:00,467," Without wishing to steal hammercarp's thunder, I use a ""knotless knot"" for this - don't ask me why it's called that  Here's how it's tied....    If you don't want the hair, just trim the tag end off - I put a drop of know glue/crazy glue on it but you don't have to. It's a good rig, makes it very hard for the fish to eject the bait without getting hooked."
561706,mbosh1980,2011-03-14 18:14:00,349,This completely has me itching to go out carping
561824,mike rousseau,2011-03-14 22:47:00,4661,  to curve the rig you can wrap the rig around something like a pop can and hold it over a steaming kettle and the steam will curve the line without damaging the line...
561837,mbosh1980,2011-03-14 23:11:00,349," I would have never guessed that, thank you. I wonder how well the puffed corn will hold up on a hair rig, but I suppose there is only one way to find out..."
561871,hammercarp,2011-03-15 00:34:00,964,MM Good idea. I never thought of it myself. I use the curve imparted to the line from the plastic spool it comes on.  
561875,hammercarp,2011-03-15 00:39:00,964,Wrap the line 6 or 8 times around the hook shank     Then put the line back through the top of the eye 
561876,hammercarp,2011-03-15 00:40:00,964,Finish with a figure 8 loop. 
561911,mbosh1980,2011-03-15 01:55:00,349,"Excellent, thanks. Looked more complicated in your first pic as it looks like a double hooklink (two lengths running in parallel)< I didn't know if the curve was achieved by a slightly shorter one or not. Again, thanks."
561917,hammercarp,2011-03-15 02:17:00,964,Bosh it is a double hooklink. Check out picture #4.
561964,mbosh1980,2011-03-15 11:08:00,349,"Got it now, thanks!"
566172,hammercarp,2011-03-26 17:01:00,964,"Puffs First I would like to start out by saying "" PUFFS RULE! ""  If you feel you want to you can add a little something extra to increase the attraction of this hookbait. You really don't need to flavour your puffs because they will pick up the flavour of the packbait used to encapsulate them.  I like to add attractants to my puffs. I feel they help. Attractants are different from flavours. My understanding is that flavours are mixtures of chemical compounds that we identify by their odor and their taste. We are all familiar with strawberry, vanilla, cherry and others that are used in candies, cakes, drinks and the like. You can flavour your packbait with these. Attractants are mixtures of chemical compounds and substances that carp recognize or associate with food.  Attractants can fool the carp into reacting as if there is food present.  The attractants that I know of are; capsaisin, chitin, amino acids, sugar and salt.  Capsaisin is one of a family of chemical compounds that are produced by ""pepper plants"". The fruit of this plant is what we call a pepper but it is more correctly called a chili. These fruits can include sweet green peppers all the way up to the deadly hot ghost nhaga. Capsaisin is one of the  chemical  compounds that make chilis hot. It is the most potent of this family of compounds. Carp are attracted by this compound and can detect it in very small concentrations in the water. They can follow this chemical trail to it's source. As a side note the firey heat produced by these compounds is only felt by mammals. They do not burn fish, reptiles, amphibians or birds. You can buy chili's or a bottle of one of the many hot sauces out there.  Chitin, the substance that the outer skin or exoskeleton of insects and arthroppods is made of. Crayfish combine it with calcium carbonate to make thier hard exoskeleton . It is also used by fungi to create their cell walls. Carp can detect this stuff and are attracted and stimulated by it. A good source for this stuff is yeast which is a fungus.  Sugar is sweet and carp do seem to like the sweet stuff. The sugar I like to use is glucose. Not only is it sweet but it is the building block of chitin, the substance mentioned above.  Amino acids are the chemical compounds that proteins are made of. Proteins are part of all living organisms. Carp can detect these compounds as well. Some amino acids are more effective than others at attracting and stimulating carp. You best bet is to buy some from a carp tackle shop. It will  come as a liquid and will have the right amino acids in it.  Salt is attractive to carp because it is part of the body chemistry of most animals and carp will actually crave salt at certain times of the year in order to maintain their bodily functions.  You can apply any of these or a combination of these substances to your puffs by disolving them in water and spraying them onto the puffs. I don't think chitin will disolve but you can grind it up very fine using a cheap electric coffee grinder.    Here is how I do it.I use a large shallow baking tray. In order to stop the puffs from rolling around I use a piece of crinkled up foil to line the bottom of the tray. Just tear off a piece slightly larger than the tray. Roll it into a ball then carefully pull it back out into a sheet again. Put as many puffs into the tray as you like but be carefull not to overcrowd them.    You will need some space between them to allow the spray to cover the sides of the puff . Apply a light mist of your attractants.  Allow the puffs to dry. Over night is plenty of time.    Turn them all over and mist the other side.    Allow them to dry and put them in a zip lock bag or a tight sealing palstic container. You are now ready to fish puffs.  It is my understanding that the real Paylake fishermen who developed this technique , whenever this is possible or practicle fix their puffs  and flavour their packbait on the bank just before fishing. They use their knowledge to determine what bait, flavours and attractants to use based on conditions at the time. Such things as the time of year ( season ), water temperature, water clarity, wind and current direction amonst other things are factored in. Their knowledge is based on years of fishing, some have up to five generations experience behind them fishing for carp.This style of fishing is used to fish competitively for carp. These paylakes basically have a tournament every weekend from March til November. Anglers line the banks of these ponds and compete for cash prizes. Some of the lakes have payouts of $250 every 15 minutes for biggest fish. There are weight prizes as well. When I learned of this I felt that the highly competitive nature of this type of fishing would produce very effective ways to catch carp. But the anglers involved in this pass time would be very tight lipped about what they do. It turns out they are very open about the basics of their craft. I am able to pass this on to you, do to the generousity of a mister Tom Brooks from Kings Mountain N. Carolina."
566781,mike rousseau,2011-03-28 07:59:00,4661,Great info ... Thanks HC
656792,hammercarp,2012-01-15 15:29:00,964,It's been almost a year but I thought I would continue this thread with some catches from the past month. All fish were caught on puffs with a simple bread pack bait from Dec. 10 to Jan. 10. 
656806,Beans,2012-01-15 16:49:00,3339,"  Thanks for sharing Lorne...  Almost makes one wish they lived closer to your end of the world (Hammytown ???)  Note I said ""Almost""...  "
656808,sleepjigging,2012-01-15 16:54:00,207,"Hammer, were you fishing near Hamilton? I didn't see much ""winter"" in your pictures.  Awesome haul. Are you sure you were not catching the same fish 10x.  Jiggy"
656809,hammercarp,2012-01-15 17:05:00,964,"We did not have much of a winter so far.  I far as I could tell there were no ""re-captures""."
656811,bigugli,2012-01-15 17:15:00,6138,"Making me very envious at the moment, Lorne. Those are some mighty nice late season fish."
656950,hammercarp,2012-01-16 01:13:00,964,Thanks guys.
657046,dsn,2012-01-16 15:22:00,1018,Oh Your starting up my itch for carpin again!  Thx
657048,Mike Pike,2012-01-16 15:27:00,1332,"That's a really nice tutorial you laid out for us Lorne, thank you!  That's a nice simple yet effective way of getting into the sport and catching some of those bruisers."
560063,hammercarp,2011-03-09 22:12:00,964,"Hey Guys. I want to introduce you to a method for catching carp  that I think is superior in many respects to the classic European method with the 12ft rod, baitrunner reel with bite alarm. This technique has evolved over the last  50 to 70 years to it's present form. The rods and reels are commonly available across North America and the baits are made with inexpensive store bought items. The line and terminal tackle are all readily available here as well. I use UglyStik rods either the 6ft or the 8 1/2 ft in MH action. The six footer I have is a one piece. I land carp over 30 lbs on these rods every year. They are fitted out with Abu Garcia Ambassadeur 6000 reels loaded with either 12 or 17 lb Berkly Trilene XT mono. Any comparable rods and reels will do. If you are starting out in carping this is the way to go because you can also fish for channel cats, pike, musky (  not the real big girls though) and even cast off piers for chinooks with the same outfit. The typical European outfit uses a Baitrunner reel which is considered an essential . The baitrunner reels were engineered to duplicate the features of a baitcaster reel ( which predate baitrunners by decades) in that baitcasters can be set on  freespool. This feature is used on a baitcaster to cast with and also allows the fish to run with the bait and not pull your outfit into the drink. The baitcaster reels have a clicker or line-out alarm which sounds off when then fish takes off with your bait. With baitrunner reels you have to buy an electronic alarm which can cost anywhere from 30 to over 200 dollars. These alarms can also be frought with problems due to water getting in them and the clicker on a baitcaster does not need a battery which we all know can run down at the most inconvenient times.  The terminal tackle consists of; a #2/0 or #1/0 straight eye baitholder hook. Mustad and  Eagle Claw  hooks will do just fine. Owner also makes a deadly sharp hook in this style and it is my favourite, a large barrel swivel , a plastic or rubber bead and egg sinkers.    The bait is in two parts. The hook bait and the pack bait.   For a hook bait a puffed corn is used. Please note not Corn Pops. These are readily available at the Bulk Barn or a local "" healthy food "" type store. They cost $2.99 for a big bag, which should last all season.    You simply impale a piece with the hook. The puffs can have stuff added to them to increase their effectivness but this is not neccessary to start with.    Please see next post"
560064,hammercarp,2011-03-09 22:16:00,964,"Bread pack is made with plain white bread which can be bought for 1 to 2 bucks a loaf. You put the fresh bread in a food processor and chop it up fine. Then place the crumbs in a zip lock bag. Squeeze most of the air out of the bag. Don't compact the bread into a solid mass though. One or two loaves will do for the day. If you don't have a food processor you can just tear the bread into little chunks. This will work but makes packing it around the hook evenly a little more difficult. Keep the zip lock bag closed to prevent the bread from drying out. That's it, simplicity at its best. Your total bait cost for the day would be between a buck and a half to four and and half bucks.  This is the method for getting your bread pack around your baited hook. Use your hand to scoop up a bunch of  pack bait . Hold your hand flat and using you other hand make a dent through the middle of the pile.    Place the baited hook into the dent.    Close your hand and squeeze repeatedly to pack the bait around the hook. Shift the pack around in you hand and squeeze repeatedly again. Repeat this until you have a nice evenly packed egg or ovoid shaped lump of bait. You are now ready to fish carp .    Please see next post"
560066,hammercarp,2011-03-09 22:19:00,964,"Cast it in to your chosen spot, point the rod tip at the bait, reel in the slack line and get ready to rumble.  This is the set up I use off of piers here in the Hamilton area. When I am sitting in the chair the reel is not in freespool , the carp cannot pull my rod in with this set up. If I leave the chair I click on the freespool button and engage the clicker. You do not need anything as complex as this but I like to be comfortable and have the rod at close hand.    With a little bit of skill and knowledge as an angler you will not just catch some carp with this method you will , as that say down south ""haul"". Have some A5 35 ready at home for your sore arms and back.   Oat pack has three ingredients , large flake steamed rolled oats, creamed corn and salt.  I buy my oats at the Bulk Barn , I put 5 scoops in a bag , this is about 2 1/2 lbs. You can also use Quaker Oats. To this you add one can of creamed corn and one heaping tablespoon of Kosher or pickling salt. Mix the three ingredients together and your oat pack will be ready to fish in less than  30 minutes.  Keep  this bait in a plastic container with a tight fitting lid. Unlike the bread pack this can not be prepared the night before but should be made on the bank. Once again, not quick or instant oats. If you use these you will end up with a solid ball that will not break down or will fly apart when casting.    Good luck and tightlines for the upcomong season."
560080,Weeds,2011-03-09 22:45:00,782,"Nice write up; thanks for that. Funny, I dusted off the Ugly Stik just last week and spooled it with 17 pound mono, egg sinker and Owner circle hook. I'm also looking forward to some spring carp'n. Cheers."
560081,vance,2011-03-09 22:45:00,719,Very interesting kinda makes me wish that there were carp in the places that I go.I am going to book mark this page for future reference.Thanks for sharing.  vance
560082,Marko,2011-03-09 22:47:00,854,And thats how you do it!! Lots of great info in there Lorne. Hope to see you on a bank soon
560083,Roy,2011-03-09 22:51:00,13728,Very good tutorial. Thank you for taking the time to post it.
560095,The Urban Fisherman,2011-03-09 23:45:00,2050,"Great tutorial for the carp newbies!  Glad to see that carp angling is becoming more recognized..... I grew up in northern Ontario, fished all my life and had never heard of carp until moving to London!  Can't wait for spring!"
560098,aplumma,2011-03-09 23:57:00,6896,well done... Thanks for the write up.   Art

560108,cuzza,2011-03-10 00:19:00,467,"Nice fish  Love the use of the foam roller too - ingenious  That's it - I'm going to dust off my baitrunners and carp rods and head for Hamilton.  For those who only have spinning reels - you can mimic a baitrunner by turning down the drag or leav ethe bail arm open and use a bait clip (which can be made from the end of a popsicle stick and some electrical tape to hold it to the handle) and you don't need alarms, just use a bobbin - when I was younger in the UK I used a wine cork with a hair clip stuck in it that was tied to the front rod rest and weighted if it was windy."
560140,Beans,2011-03-10 01:44:00,3339,Thanks for the heads up about this post Lorne...  Very interesting method using packbait...will have to give it a try this coming season  I have to pay the Bulk Barn a visit soon for some anise and koolade and will check out those corn puffs...
560147,bassjnkie,2011-03-10 02:07:00,1101,"Great write up Lorne, thanks. I have a paylake rod/reel setup I'm dying to try."
560253,hammercarp,2011-03-10 14:58:00,964,There is another thing I need to add. The curve in the hooklink/snell is there on purpose. It serves a function and contributes to the rigs effectiveness.    This technique for catching carp is a system and is most effective when used in it's entirety.
560268,bassjnkie,2011-03-10 16:00:00,1101,Nice!! But there here to stay!! HA!
560312,hammercarp,2011-03-10 19:00:00,964,If any one has any questions about this technique you cab ask here or visit me at the Niagara Outdoor show this weekend. I will be happy to help.

560767,cuzza,2011-03-11 20:38:00,467," Thanks, I'll take you up on that when (if?) the weather warms up a bit"
560806,bassjnkie,2011-03-11 22:24:00,1101,Lorne I have a question and hope it's ok to post it here.  Pack Bait breaks down nicely in warm water conditions which will leave the hook bait exposed rather quickly. How would cold water temps. affect the break down rate?
560821,Billy Bob,2011-03-11 22:59:00,5865,Question: what tastes better the fish or the bait...LOL  Nice report...  :clapping:
560851,Beans,2011-03-12 00:23:00,3339, Ok Lorne I'll bite...why the curve in the hook link/snell?  Best I can figure is the corn puff floats and would keep the bait just off bottom like a pop-up boilie or make the pack bait sit up like an ice cream cone until it breaks down...  And...how does one tie it like that ?...
560867,hammercarp,2011-03-12 00:53:00,964,"Good question Beans. What happens is that when the pack breaks down, the hook buoyed up by the puff, pops up out of the pile of bait. The rig will be sitting there in a C shape partially buried in the pack bait pile. When the carp sucks it up the curved hooklink/snell will temporarily straighten out, then spring back. This will cause the hook to position itself around the carps lips. It will also make it more difficult for the carp to eject the baited hook. Better than 9 times out of 10 the carp will be hooked with the hook rapped right around the bottom lip. It does not matter how the carp approaches the baited hook it will result in the same hook up. Once you set the hook there is no escape. I lose very few fish on this rig. I hope this explains it. One of the reasons I held off posting on this technique for catching carp was that I did not have a small aquarium or container with a flat clear side to take a video or pictures of what happens as the packbait breaks. I will do so when I have the right equipment."
561073,Beans,2011-03-12 16:32:00,3339, Thanks Lorne...good stuff !   
561249,hammercarp,2011-03-13 01:24:00,964, Good question Daniel The cold water will result in a longer break time with packbaits but I don't think it will affect bread pack all that much.
