777482,Radnine,2013-04-04 01:57:00,1538,Can anyone tell me why reel companies use line test ratings as an indication of yard of capacity? Has braid (along with many other styles of line) not made this rating system obsolete? Jim
777483,Burtess,2013-04-04 02:02:00,901,I think most also list line diameter in mm and capacity in M as well.  And I guess that is why the braid manufacturers list a comparable mono line test on their packaging.  Burt
777484,Sinker,2013-04-04 02:02:00,8692,"Braid still has a diameter rated in lbs.  For example, 15lb test, 4lb diameter.  S."
777485,kickingfrog,2013-04-04 02:03:00,8333,For most the best option is to look at line diamiter. Some reels now also list the braid capacity. Not sure how accurate it it though.
777490,Old Ironmaker,2013-04-04 02:12:00,8243,"Has anyone ever checked to be sure, now that would be anal!"
777491,Sinker,2013-04-04 02:14:00,8692,It doesn't make much difference if you only put 100yds of braid on top of mono to start with  S.
777521,bare foot wader,2013-04-04 15:20:00,1354,shimano has their spool ratings for mono and power pro
777552,davey buoy,2013-04-04 19:03:00,5505,"And another example,8/30 power Pro would be 8lb diameter,30 lb strength."
777586,captpierre,2013-04-04 22:12:00,2521,powerpro owned by Shimano?
777661,bare foot wader,2013-04-05 02:00:00,1354," yep, shimano bought out innovative textiles, which produces power pro...didn't take long after power pro hit the market"
