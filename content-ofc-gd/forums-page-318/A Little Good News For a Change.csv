I will be getting out in the boat in the coming weeks though so I'm sure it won't be long before I'm posting some ice-out panfish reports!  That being said, I came across this news story today and thought it was worth passing along.  I know we have plenty of dog lovers on OFC and this hits home with regards to ice safety as well.  There's so much bad news going around these days that I couldn't help but pass off a news story that has a happy ending for once.  http://www.ctvnews.ca/canada/dog-helps-rescue-two-girls-from-icy-river-in-edmonton-1.1218989  Cheers, Ryan"

It was truly incredible how the dog sensed the girls danger and managed to rescue her.  I am sure they will receive an award from Ottawa, great storey. Look forward to your reports."
777548,Joey,2013-04-04 18:14:00,9122,What a brave dog and owner.  Hope they get a bravery citation.  This could have ended much worse and all 4 could have died.  So glad things turned out well for all of them
