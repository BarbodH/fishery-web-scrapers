777675,Fishaholic,2013-04-05 04:19:00,22,"Hello all,        My name is Adam, and I am a Fishaholic. I want to send a warning out to those who feel addiction would never happen to them, and that fishing is ""just a hobby"". That was me not long ago!  When you start stealing your fiance's earrings to use them as lures, you know you're a fishaholic!     I've been lurking for quite some time and felt it was time to contribute to the discussion.     I'm a 30 year old high school teacher from Brampton. The fishing bug has bit me hard over the past couple of years. Most of my fishing is done out of my modest 16' Sea Nymph, but love the hardwater as well, and will  be purchasing a fishing kayak this spring (Leaning toward Cuda 12).       Favorite is bass fishing, but I enjoy all types. I'm pretty big into the researching/studying aspect of the sport, and hope to continue to learn from you all (and contribute myself!).      Feel free to post your secret spots below (I know that is a no-no, but I can't help myself.... I'm a fishaholic!).. j/k       Adam"

777677,lickmyarmpit,2013-04-05 05:29:00,359,"I suffer from the same addiction tried meetings, and rehab but I keep relapsing.  Only cure it seems is blowing all my money on tackle and getting on the water as often as possible."
777678,Old Ironmaker,2013-04-05 09:35:00,8243,"Welcome.  You certainly are brave, admitting one has an addiction is the first step to recovery. I have heard that one addiction could  lead to others. Next thing you know you may start golfing. as well you can lose your job, we don't want your types anywhere around our children."
777689,Rich,2013-04-05 11:11:00,3927,Welcome aboard!  I think finding help for your addiction here would be as useful as an AA meeting at a downtown bar. Lmao

777898,Handlebarz,2013-04-06 10:16:00,3790,"Welcome aboard Adam great intro. You will find many in your area with the same good problems they all hang out here some post some are still in denile about there Non Problem which is a good thing for them. Once you take the first step like you did and introduce yourself it gets better from there as you will now have many others to share your Non Problem with and maybe meet up with to talk about this Non Problem on the water. I have heard the best recovery from this so called additcion is to beat it with a Ugly Stick Ive been trying for years, but each season I have to go back to be sure I DO NOT HAVE A PROBLEM!!!"

777922,Jen,2013-04-06 13:48:00,833,"Hi Adam,  Some will say you will get a break in the winter months, others will help you fill your urges by suggesting ICE FISHING and early spring dip netting for suckers so you can catch your own bait to channel cat fish... just saying. NOPE NOT AN ADDICT!!!  Others will suggest you not hang your rods in your livingroom in the off season!  I see nothing wrong with adding to the decor.  Welcome to OFC.  You have stubbled into the right place... look forward to reading all about your adventures."

I have a sick fetish in that I enjoy opening up a plano and seeing all the hooks and weights organized just perfect (I guess one could say my addiction is ""terminal""  )  .Jen,I don#t get too many breaks, I do love ice fishing!! Right now things are slow just some terrible attempts at steelheading.A few mentions of wives... my fiancee is very low maint, and likes fishing herself (Although is scared of pike..  )"
