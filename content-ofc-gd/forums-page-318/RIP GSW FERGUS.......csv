Their business plan is to maximize profits. Why should our business plan be any different. Why must the fall back position always be to attack each other in these matters? Low hanging fruit is the easiest to pick away at I guess. As  increasingly expensive and difficult as it is to keep pace I haven't moved to another jurisdiction."
777980,Radnine,2013-04-06 19:42:00,1538, Wow! Good for you G. Normally people would have to join a union for that kind of package. Hey.....wait a tick.....

Many of my high school buddies got in there in the 80's. Both my grandparents retired from there in the 70's.  I know Fergus is not the same small town it was when I left in 82...but I'm sure many will still be effected by this.  It saddens me to hear  this."
777596,Gerritt,2013-04-04 22:46:00,6129,Yup... more and more manufacturers will move offshore as unions and governments squeeze them for every nickel and dime.....

777599,irishfield,2013-04-04 23:00:00,26272,It's called a dollar at par with the US green back.... some think it's a great thing.. it's NOT! Bring back the 75 cent dollar.

777610,irishfield,2013-04-04 23:27:00,26272,"Yah I know that G... just a wish.. as I have a huge amount of aircraft parts that I bought when the dollar was about 1.42/1 and there's no point in even advertising them for sale with everything based on the US dollar in aviation.. I'd rather hold onto it till the day the kids have their ""auction"", than give away 42% right out of the gate.  Many local companies, our Plastics plant included, the dollar difference on exchange covered the operating costs if you signed your contracts with US companies at the right time. We are one of a very few major employers left in Midland/Penetang and only because we had no debt going into the ""depression"". The rest are downsized to the point that they may as well shut down and I know from talking with some of the owners and CAO's they are working on that..."

Here where I am, ExxonMobile Films division just closed up shop 100's out of work..  I just hope it is the banks that collapse, not the will of the people.  G"

777647,moxie,2013-04-05 01:06:00,1566,"Sad to hear of another closing. With all due respect Gerritt you might want to find another target. I belong to a private sector union and I can assure you I earn every nickle and dime I make. The system has been manipulated to give us what we are experiencing and has nothing to do with the protection for a fair wage, its workers and their families. Said it before,  The ultra rich have taken their money out of the global economies and all thats left is the Boomers nest egg."

777660,danc,2013-04-05 02:00:00,4677," As long as you are happy with your wage, pension, and benefit package, then that's all that matters Gerritt."
777662,Gerritt,2013-04-05 02:05:00,6129,"Thanks Dan, I have all three of those in spades. Great wage, company paid pension and a very comprehensive benefit package. Add to that profit sharing and stocks, Personal days, sick days etc   G  Edit to add... Sorry if my post de-railed this thread... but I spoke my piece."
777692,Ryan Landry,2013-04-05 11:36:00,128,"I agree with Gerrit, unions get to greedy and end up with nothing. To anyone who feels $28 and hour is fair wage to put a few screws in an engine over and over when skilled trades are making only a few dollars more per hour needs a head shake! I'm not taking shots at anyone personally, just using this as an example. It's all about numbers and the type of industry. It's simple math....... As soon as the wages are pushed past that line where it becomes more economical to move the operation overseas then it most likely will. People need to realize where they stand and unions need to start giving a sh!t about the financial states of the company's who employ the people they represent. For example people who manufacture cars/ car parts are in more danger than tradesmen like plumbers, sheet metal workers or electricians since there jobs can not be sent overseas. What I'm trying to say is unions are not all theyre cracked up to be. Shure they do a lot of good for people but as soon as they cross that fine line of fair/greed everything they've done is erased because your job is gone!  people need to realize that sometimes it's just better to have a job, especially in smaller towns. A few extra bucks an hour or nothing seems like simple math to me. But apparently simple math isn't so simple to those who run these unions. Thanks"

777874,moxie,2013-04-06 02:29:00,1566,"I hear you Gerritt. As I stated there was no disrespect intended on my part.  I will agree that many unions have done themselves and their members many a dis service over the years but we must keep in mind that no employer has had a gun held to their head and forced to sign any collective bargaining agreement(except for public sector unions which are what I consider a conflict of interest). I am employed in the private sector and hold membership in a private sector union in the sewer and water main sector. Operating 78,000 lbs of iron 10-11 hrs, 5-6 days a week in ever changing soil and weather conditions is challenging at the best of times and I am paid handsomely to do so and most days still love what I do. That being said the company that employs me has also made large profits over the years on the backs of members both past and present as is their right. Governments on the other hand spend far more than they take in.  In times such as these it is even more important to stand our ground and protect what we have. We haven't created this downturn and as costs for essentials continue to rise I give those few bucks you mentioned back with every passing year and do not intend on giving up ground without a fight.  This is much larger than any union. I paid almost $23,000 in taxes last year (+ 13% on everything else) and that would suit me fine if it was used to help my fellow man but it never seems to make it to those who need it most or to programs that make sound economic sense. Also keep in mind that if I make less that means less will be extorted from my family . Last time I checked our household had yet to turn a profit. Governments and their owners are your enemies, not my union pay rate."
777882,zamboniwaterboy,2013-04-06 03:22:00,126,"Without the union jobs, no need for the over paid trades either!  Commercial plumber at $300/hr plus $75 gas charge, shop is five minutes away!"
777886,danc,2013-04-06 04:19:00,4677,"I'll bet that the local Chevy dealership owner is happy that union members are making $40.00 an hour, so that they can afford to buy those nice new trucks. Home builders too. Someone has to be making the cash to keep them going. The boat dealerships, rv and quad dealerships. These are mostly blue collar markets. Guys that turn wrenches 5 days a week and like to go fishing on the weekends. What about that that $150.00 charge at the pumps for gas before you head out? Don't forget about that mortgage payment. And food on the table for the family. Ooops. property taxes are due this month too. My point is this. Making a good wage is not such a bad thing. You earn it and you spend it. It's good for everyone. It keeps the economy rolling. I'm not saying that you have to be union to achieve this. But it's a lot easier when you unite. The government (that's us) will also thank you when you pay 20 to 25k in taxes per year, and when they don't have to bail you out when you retire because you have no personal pension. I get paid very well in the private sector. My employers have always been very wealthy. I just don't see why so many people think that being paid lower wages is the answer."
