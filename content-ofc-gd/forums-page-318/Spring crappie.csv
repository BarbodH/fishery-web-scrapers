Those who expect 100 fish per hour, aren't usually willing to put in the time, and leave frustrated. The son and I on the other hand....     A lot of success is coming on a new line of jigs we started producing, and experimenting with, this spring. The son even started making his own floats. Gotta admit I'm having way too much fun."
778008,livinisfishin,2013-04-06 23:13:00,661,That is awesome! Going to try for spring crappie this year and hope i do half as good as you!
778009,Fishaholic,2013-04-06 23:15:00,22,"Nice haul!      About time we had some softwater reports! Nice to see the effort with the jigs is paying off. I haven't been out for any crappie yet this spring, but it would hit the spot after a winter of perch!"
778011,crappieperchhunter,2013-04-06 23:23:00,2582,Awesome Bruce. I ended up working today I'm hoping for some open water perching next weekend...but the amount of ice out there might make me wait even longer then that.
778016,EC1,2013-04-07 00:14:00,930,I could use a softwater crappie fix right about now. Some good looking jigs you got there too! Good catch!
778018,Moosebunk,2013-04-07 00:51:00,3970,Lucky duck!  Lookin' forward to crappie fishing with buddies.  Fun social fish... ya can eat!!!  Can't beat that!  Good fishing B-Ugs!
778023,moxie,2013-04-07 01:00:00,1566,Nice to see a report devoid of ice. Well done and thanks for sharing.
778028,BillM,2013-04-07 02:12:00,17367,Sweet!!!  Still lots and lots of ice up here.
778029,Rich,2013-04-07 02:23:00,3927,Nice! Hope to get some myself mid week. Only a few dinks here and there so far for me.
778030,danc,2013-04-07 02:24:00,4677,Awesome Bigu. Tons of ice and no Crappies up here to boot. I'm jealous.

778100,pics,2013-04-07 16:27:00,1268,"Dave, maybe we should invite this fellow to the Stelco Fishing Club awards night....feed him some beers till he gives up some crappie secrets..."
778210,NAW,2013-04-08 01:18:00,4022,"Nice going Bruce!  Let me know if you want any ""pro-staffers"" to test out your new jigs"
778232,bigugli,2013-04-08 03:06:00,6138,"Despite the high winds we still had an OK day. Spot #1 is slowing down now as the bullheads and gills start moving in, but other spots are just starting to warm up. The boys' collection for a feed tonight  This young girl insists in calling me Santa. Could be..... She has this one goose trained. It follows her around every time she visits the hole. http://i1161.photobucket.com/albums/q515/uglifinn/DSCN3972_zps52a4cd73.jpg"
778248,RickOnt,2013-04-08 12:03:00,669,Nice catch there Bruce.  The 'New' Jigs are working!!! Rick
778268,ehg,2013-04-08 13:52:00,2666,Those white crappie aren't caught much in Ontario. Good fishing!

778293,Rattletrap2,2013-04-08 17:45:00,1652,"Bruce, Nice report and soe nice looking fish! What is it with ""photobucket"" and me? Every time I try to look at a photo that someone has posted from photobucket, it appears on my screen in a quick flash, then disappears! lol Is it a setting on my end?"
778303,jimmer,2013-04-08 18:59:00,2730,They lool like black crappie to me. Is that a white perch? Awesome catch anyway you look at it!
778314,bigugli,2013-04-08 20:52:00,6138,"Yes that is a white perch. We often find a few in the 10-12"" range."
778323,ehg,2013-04-08 22:04:00,2666,"You are right. They are just more pale than Kawartha crappie, thus i mistook them."
