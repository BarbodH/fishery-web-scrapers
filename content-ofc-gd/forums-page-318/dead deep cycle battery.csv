778055,Big Cliff,2013-04-07 11:13:00,6899,Just wondering if you managed to do anything with that battery?
778275,fishnsled,2013-04-08 15:01:00,3520,"Might want to try this stuff,  Battery Equaliser  http://alexmilne.com/resources/pdf/battery_equaliser.pdf   Read good things about it on another fishing board and some guys are swearing by it for their deep cycles.  One guy had completely dead batteries and added this stuff and after 4 charge and drain cycles the batteries were as good as new and got 2 more years out of them.  Could buy you a season or 2 for much less than the cost of a new battery."
778284,Dabluz,2013-04-08 16:14:00,701,"First of all....real deep cycle batteries are expensive.  Some Canadian Tire stores sell one but it costs over 300 dollars.  Those ""Nautilus"" batteries are in fact hybrid batteries that can deliver enough current to be used as a starting battery.  Second: Real deep cycle batteries must be recharged with chargers that can do the job.  Maybe Canadian Tire does sell them now but not 3 or 4 years ago.  Sure, some people get more years of service than others but lit's due to the fact that they are not using a real deep cycle battery or for a bunch of other reasons.  Not everyone uses their batteries the same way.  So far, the best deep cycle battery charger that I have used can be found at Walmart's.....lol.  It's made by a company called Schumacher.  On top of that....they are inexpensive.  I recommend the 15 amp model.  When I first bought this charger, I recharged a couple of deep cycle batteries that I had and even a dead car battery.  One deep cycle battery (Demone) was new and was acting up.  I even returned it to the manufacturer and they assured me that it was ok.  This is when I decided to throw away my old CT battery charger and buy the Schumacher.  Anyway, the dead car battery was restored, and my new Demone now charges fully.  It has been over 2 years now and so far all the batteries are doing fine.   I still have a few years before I can really say that I have solved my problem of having batteries that die off after 3 or 4 years.  If you ever have a battery that will not accept a charge from your small charger (voltmeter does not budge), add another battery in series with the dead battery and connect the charger for a few minutes.  This extra current overcomes the resistance to the charge in the dead battery.  Another way is to use a very strong battery charger and increase the charge rate to 40 or 50 amps or even more current for a few minutes.  As for the stuff that goes into the battery to make it ""hardier"".....I doubt it.  If that was the case, all the battery companies would be using it.  Yes, some dead batteries can be restored.  It's a long process involving repeated charging of the battery using only distilled water and changing the water after each charge until there is no more acid in the cells then adding acid and recharging the battery."
778438,super dave,2013-04-09 12:41:00,323,Thats everyone for the tips.  I have a 15 amp schumacher and my friend has a motomaster.  So i'll give both a shot to see if it restores.
776923,super dave,2013-04-01 20:20:00,323,I have a deep cycle battery that wonâ€™t hold a charge.  I tried topping it up with distilled water and charging the crap out of it.  Is there anything else I can try or is it junk?  How do I dispose  this battery properly if it can't be used anymore?
776925,davey buoy,2013-04-01 20:22:00,5505,Drop it outside CT.How old is the battery?
776927,Terry,2013-04-01 20:25:00,14456,will it  take a charge or will it not stay fully charged
776930,misfish,2013-04-01 20:29:00,29133," WO WO WO,,just dont drop it off,theres a 10 buck pay back. Get a new battery and get 10 bucks back."
776931,super dave,2013-04-01 20:32:00,323,"I have this battery charge meter that came with my min kota trolling motor.  after charging, i'll test it an hour later and it will always read one bar out of 5."
776935,Big Cliff,2013-04-01 20:36:00,6899,"I have a charger that will desulfiate many batteries, I have been able to recover several that would have gone to scrap. Might be worth a try."
776936,Terry,2013-04-01 20:38:00,14456,if it  take a charge then drops off it's dead get a big enough charger to bring it to a boil sometimes it helps
776940,davey buoy,2013-04-01 20:43:00,5505,"Should of mentioned if you want to buy a new battery at Ct,they will give you a credit for $10 when you buy a new one.Free drop off if you don't want to buy one.lol."
776949,dhickey,2013-04-01 21:48:00,1038,Rulue # 1 Do not buy a battery from CT..  Rule # 2-5 See above  Go to bps or any marina close to you.
776960,Old Ironmaker,2013-04-01 22:25:00,8243," Big Cliff,  Where  would I find such a charger and what will I be looking for?"
776979,Big Cliff,2013-04-01 23:26:00,6899,"I got mine at CTC, I'll get you the name and mak tomorrow. It automatically senses a sulphyted battery and goes into a ""mode' to try to desulphite it. Hasn't worked on every one but better than half of all the ones I've tried have gotten me another year out of them. The better the quality of the battery, the better the results seem to be."
776982,captpierre,2013-04-01 23:34:00,2521,Costco is a great place to buy a battery.  Should have deep cycles too
776987,Kerry,2013-04-01 23:42:00,383,Costco does have deep cycle batteries.I bought mine for my boat and trailer last year.Paid I think 78 bucks each and didn't have to pay a core charge.Took my old batteries to the metal recyclers and got 5 bucks each. Kerry
776988,Muskieman,2013-04-01 23:44:00,2472,"Buying a battery , I've sold at least 2000 of them .  "" Core Charge "" Battery 100$ core charge 5$ = 105$ + tax . old battery returned later with receipt or at POS . Battery 100$ core charge 5$ = 105$ + tax - 5$ core charge = 100$ + tax."
776990,Old Ironmaker,2013-04-01 23:51:00,8243,"Thank you sir.  Salty,  You said, ""Go to bps or any marina close to you.""  I'm shopping for new deep cell batteries, what is bps? And why no CTC battery? Most no name batteries ie Nautilus are made by Johnson Controls, I'm being steered towards Kirkland brand from Costco by a few folks here, as does captpierre who just posted. Kirkland is  Costco's generic brand, named after where their headquarters are in Kirkland Washington. Costco doesn't have a battery factory either and guess who makes Kirkland, Johnson Controls, same company that makes Canadian Tire brand and Walmart batteries and many others as well."
776992,davey buoy,2013-04-01 23:57:00,5505,"Nautilus works for me,I have two I have been using for over 5 years.Bring them in for the winter.Start of the season I slow charge them overnight,into the boat they go till fall.Repeat.Guess what?,bought from CT. No complaints here."
777008,Fisherman,2013-04-02 00:43:00,7201,"One point no one has made is to check the ""in service date"" on the battery.  There should be 2 dates, the manufature date and the date or month it is activated or acid added.  You would be surprised how many sit on the shelf, doesn't matter what store, and you end up buying something that's half dead before yuo make use of it.  The longer it sits without being maintained or recharged, the shorter the lifespan is."
777014,Angler management,2013-04-02 01:07:00,280,"After buying a battery from bps for $300 i decided to go to a 24v system, so i bought a second one from sail for $250 and it lasted 2 charges before it stopped holding charge. Guy at sail said they got almost all of them back for same reason. Then i went to canadian tire and bought a nautilus for $160 i think, and it holds a better charge still then any of the other ones at half the price... Just my experience tho."
777043,fish_fishburn,2013-04-02 03:16:00,1311,Go to Total Battery and pick up a little dew hicky that you hook up to your battery when charging and it sends rapid pulse waves or something like that and knocks the crud of the plates. Also have little bottles of pink stuff you add to your battery to help restore them. It works i haved them and therre not a gimmick.
777045,bow slayer,2013-04-02 03:31:00,1074,"just to add,take any dead auto battery to your local scrap metal place....the ones in the London area give you 11 bucks for everyone you bring to them."
777100,Big Cliff,2013-04-02 15:11:00,6899,"OK, it is a Motomaster Intelligent automatic battery charger. If I remember correctly they are about $90.00 but I think I only paid about $65.00 for it on special. I'd gladly lend you mine to try if we can arange to get it to you."
777108,ecmilley,2013-04-02 15:36:00,2163,I gots the same one. nautilus smart charger really works well for getting a full charge
777167,Old Ironmaker,2013-04-02 17:55:00,8243,"Thanks Big Cliff, much appreciated, will take a look."
777168,Angler management,2013-04-02 18:06:00,280,I also have the motomaster i picked up on sale for $60-70. Works amazing!!
777222,Big Cliff,2013-04-02 20:12:00,6899,"I'm trying to figure out how I can get my charger down to you or your battery up here. Might be able to work out some kind of a relay with a little help from some other members. Even if we can get the battery up to Milton, I have to go down there in the next week or so to pick up a fridge and dishwasher to help a friend out. If you could get the battery to Milton, I can take care of getting up here and back down if we can get it working."
