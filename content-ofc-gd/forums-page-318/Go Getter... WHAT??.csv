778180,mike rousseau,2013-04-07 23:29:00,4661,Extra insurance.... Peace of mind...  Haven't had one fail yet... Even with accidental musky...
778181,mike rousseau,2013-04-07 23:32:00,4661,"I tried 100lb flouro once... Too hard to tie... But I got a 53"" musky my first night testing them...  Walleye dint seam to care how thick the line is...  I've tried a bunch and 40lb is plenty strong and easy to tie...."
777990,TJQ,2013-04-06 21:28:00,7806,OK.. this is gonna sound a lttle stupid.. but someone asked me if i could add go getters to my store... for walleye.... whats a go getter... is it like a walleye harness??  Ive never used them.
777992,irishfield,2013-04-06 21:33:00,26272,"It's a female companion, that you send for beer, when the fishing is too good to leave the lake!"
777993,Tayzak15,2013-04-06 21:34:00,318,Yeah they're spinners like the ones in the link below  http://strikezonetackle.com/Go-Getters2010.png
777994,bare foot wader,2013-04-06 21:35:00,1354,only go getter i've heard of was kinda of a modern day replica of an older plug..plastic body with metal lip you can bend to adust the diving depth  or i think i've heard somebody refer to a lure retriever as a go getter too
777996,bare foot wader,2013-04-06 21:36:00,1354,here's the link  http://www.bittentackle.com/index.php?categoryID=5
777998,TJQ,2013-04-06 21:44:00,7806,So really a single hook and spinner walleye harness.
777999,Fang,2013-04-06 21:48:00,1330,Think of a basic pre rigged Snell hook but add a red bead and then a small gold or silver blade on the line right above the hook. A Quebec mainstay for trout and walleye. Sold boxes upon boxes way back when I worked at lebarons
778000,HTHM,2013-04-06 21:54:00,4082,It is a younger brother: source - I was the youngest in my family
778003,Tybo,2013-04-06 22:38:00,1373,Dad had a go-getter. His name was Paul.
778006,misfish,2013-04-06 23:02:00,29133, 
778014,Musky or Specks,2013-04-06 23:45:00,2710,Oh God Growing Up fishing with my Grandpa in the 70's thats all we ever used on Golden Lake and any where else walleye could be found. Standard worm harness.
778034,Sinker,2013-04-07 02:49:00,8692,One of my go to's......  S.
778087,Rod Caster,2013-04-07 14:34:00,5784,We always referred to go-getters as speckled trout spinners...but it's the exact same as the ones Tayzak posted. My go-to specky lure.
778090,TJQ,2013-04-07 15:05:00,7806,Thanks guys... Ill get to work!  (rather ill get my kids to work.. lol)
778104,mike rousseau,2013-04-07 16:54:00,4661,They are easy to make TJ...  I make my own for walleye so they can handle what I throw at em... Store bought ones for some reason are made with light mono and garbage hooks... I use 40lb flouro...  With supplies from cabelas and using 40lb flouro leader material it costs about $1 per spinner... That's paying retail for materials... And they would easily sell for $2+ per spinner...
778109,TJQ,2013-04-07 17:13:00,7806,Ya.. they dont look too hard thats for sure... can you guys post your favorites so i have a better idea of what us northerners use.. i picked up a couple at CT for examples...  what size blades do you use Mike??
778115,Nipfisher,2013-04-07 17:46:00,2449,Here are some more pictures T.J. Almost all we use for drifting.  
778116,mike rousseau,2013-04-07 17:46:00,4661,Size 4 blades... Size 2 hook...  5mm beads...  And I use the plastic quick change clevises so I can switch blades instead of changing rigs all day...  And I tie em short to fit in a tackle tray nicely...          
778118,mike rousseau,2013-04-07 18:05:00,4661,And we get walleye of all sizes on those...
778119,TJQ,2013-04-07 18:07:00,7806,Seriously.. you guys are the best.
778120,mike rousseau,2013-04-07 18:11:00,4661,And by tying them short and tying a leader with a swivel and snap swivel... You eliminate that anoying line twist tangle that can happen with spinners....
778148,adempsey,2013-04-07 19:59:00,1498,"I always associated Go Getters with what Nipfisher posted.   A single hook harness with a #2 or #3 Indiana blade for trout fishing, not a #4 Colorado blade for walleye fishing.   That's just me though =)"
778150,adempsey,2013-04-07 20:02:00,1498, Not to mention saving $ on fluorocarbon.   I noticed you burn the tag end as well.   Is that just extra insurance?  or do you find it necessary?
778168,Rod Caster,2013-04-07 22:03:00,5784,"These have been a staple for brook trout fishing in my family.  Red beads, gold colorado or indiana blade.... usually a #4 baitholder hook.  "
778174,Sinker,2013-04-07 22:43:00,8692,"Yep, what mike posted is pretty much the same as what I do. I use 20lb fluoro, and prefer them short like that.  For specks, smaller blades, smaller hooks, and 12lb fluoro.  S."
