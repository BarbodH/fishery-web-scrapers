777570,SirCranksalot,2013-04-04 21:23:00,3291,Why do you guys keep adding irrelevant comments?
777788,misfish,2013-04-05 22:25:00,29133," Cuz theres a few  members on this thread,that are  MIA.  I got a good laugh at the guest,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"
777789,Roy,2013-04-05 22:34:00,13728, He left us about a year and a half before you joined. His comments were not asinine...they were just GCD. You had to be here.
777792,misfish,2013-04-05 22:37:00,29133,"The dawg was a cool dude,IMO. Like many here,just had to know where he was coming from. Like me.LOL"
777793,Roy,2013-04-05 22:39:00,13728, You got that right me Brudder.
777796,BillM,2013-04-05 23:00:00,17367,"GCD with the shirtless catfish pics, lol!   He was a riot."
778356,passthepitonspete,2013-04-09 00:34:00,64,"Thanks for the bump, guys.  Not long now before we head back.  My dad is 88 this year, and the old fart just won't give up.  I'm not sure he'll be able to ""carry his age"" any more, in fact I'd bet against it, but me and Ian can cover the portaging.  What we *do* need my dad for is to catch the biggest fish, which he always seems to do.  Don't you guys bump old posts in this forum?  It happens all the time in other sporting forums.  Some of you seem surprised.  Glad we're not going in via Opeongo Lake this year.  I would be afraid the ice wouldn't be off soon enough!  Here's hoping for some warm temps, warm winds, and warm sunshine.  I've had enough of winter.  Cheers, eh? Pete"
63978,Cookslav,2007-04-24 01:03:00,1457,"That was a great read, and most definatly the best post I've read to date! Some impressive results as well I might add...  Thanks so much for sharing that. I'm headed in with My dad first week of May...those father son trips are the stuff memories are made of. (mind you my 4 brothers will be there as wll so Portaging wil be a bit easier)"
63986,Dano,2007-04-24 01:40:00,719,"Wow, what a wonderful journey, thanks for taking us along.   I cant say I agree with this though. I have been in some wonderful old growth stands amid wonderful scenery and fishing in far north Ontario, quality stuff.  Cheers"
64139,passthepitonspete,2007-04-24 15:36:00,64,"Woo-hoo!  Thanks so much for all your kind replies!  Sorry not to get back to yous yet as I've been pretty busy this week.  I will definitely reply to your posts and PM's shortly, as soon as I get the chance.  I haven't shown my dad this post yet, and will wait til a few more reply as I'm sure he'll get a kick out of it, and get him psyched for this year's carries.  Bwah-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!!!  [Actually, Ian is joining us this year, so we can take it easy on the guy this time....]  Dano, when I said ""far north"" I meant far north, like downstream Albany and Wakwayowkastic Rivers towards James Bay places.  My dad and I did a 120-mile trip down the Albany a few years ago - drive in and fly out - and while the waterfalls and rapids are beautiful, paddling for hours along extremely ""samey"" river with nothing but ugly little trees growing on muddy riverbanks without a single outcrop of rock to be seen is [to me] nowhere near as pretty as Algonquin or Quetico.  And if you think the far north of Ontario is samey, you oughta see the Yellowknife River in NWT [or whatever they call the place this year] - you get excited by a small stand of three-inch-diameter trees.  One wonders how Franklin ever constructed Fort Wilderness out of miserable little twigs like those."
64144,mattyk,2007-04-24 16:15:00,2110,great essay! Thanks for sharing.
64151,Golfisher,2007-04-24 16:46:00,586,"Just finished reading the whole series.  I must say, it's one hell of a journey.  As someone else already noted, your father is a trooper!  I hope I'd be able to take a trip like that in my old age, but I'd ensure that my son carries everything.    Thanks for the report."
64260,passthepitonspete,2007-04-24 23:19:00,64,"Sorry for the tardiness of my reply, mates.  Busy busy busy.  Thanks for the encouragement, eh?  It is an Actuarial Fact, Golfisher, that each day spent fishing increases your life expectancy by at least one day.  But then you already knew that ...."
64382,Dano,2007-04-25 01:18:00,719,"Oh man, awesome El Cap stuff too! I could read your stuff all day..... Thanks again."
65316,passthepitonspete,2007-04-27 14:29:00,64,"Hey guys,  Thanks so much for your kind comments.  It encourages me to want to try again.  Never for a moment would I make any ""rules"" for reading my post - I was merely offering instructions on how to keep it de-clusterfrigged.  Those of you who know me know that I am about the last person to ever obey a rule [ask my ex-wife]  I didn't realize that the forum downsizes images, so next time instead of making them 700 pixels wide, I can downsize to 500 which is roughly half the area, so they'll load faster and I can make fewer threads.  I think there are still enough guys on dialup that it's worth splitting for now.  Even Mepps' photo at 640 is too wide for this forum.  I'll go skinny next time, or maybe try the blog approach that SlowPoke suggests.  For those of you who feel my story is too wordy, I make no apologies.  Jean-Paul Sartre wrote, ""on a toujours la choix.""  If you don't want to read it, you can just look at the pictures.  I think there's a need and demand for decent writing in places other than magazines that you have to buy.  Harv and Doug and Cookslav, please drop me a line after you get back and we'll compare how we did.  Thanks, Gerrit.  Good luck on the 9th, Mike.  Superb rainbow postings you've made.  Your website looks pretty cool, too.  If you adventurers want some ""real"" Ontario adventure, we can paddle across Mazinaw Lake and I'll take you four pitches up Bon Echo for some pretty rad exposure straight over the lake 300' below.  Thanks Trophymuskie and Sinker, and Smokey, Jerseydog and Grimace.  A few people just got confused when I was putting the thing together, and the links didn't yet work.  This despite the ""under construction"" caveats everywhere.  Sheesh.  Thanks to everyone else who took the time to read and post.  Much appreciated!  We're heading up on Sunday, can't wait!   Woo-hoo!  Cheers and beers, Pete"

For those of us who love Trouting in the Park this is an excellent post which I feel needs to be rerun.  If any of you have other threads in a similar vein please bump them as well.

63167,passthepitonspete,2007-04-22 01:48:00,64,"Like, how’s it goin’, eh?  Here’s a little photo essay trip report of my May 2006 canoeing and fishing trip to Algonquin Park with my dad.  We’ve been fishing here most springs for nearly twenty years, and every trip is an adventure.    It’s always been my belief – and sometimes it’s actually true! – that “the quality of fishing is directly proportional to the discomfort in reaching it.”  Accordingly, the photo you see above is my dad holding a 4¼-pound speckled trout that he caught three years ago – our Family Record – and for which we portaged five miles in each direction!  I’ve split up the photos into five posts, each post with about six or seven photos hotlinked. You can just scroll down and read the story as you look at the photos, and follow the link to the next page. For me, this was the easiest and most effective way to present the story, and it will save you poor buggers with dial-up connections a bit of bother since all the photos won’t load onto a single page.  Now here are the INSTRUCTIONS FOR LOOKING AT THE PHOTO ESSAY:  1. The post is in six parts – this is the instruction page, and the photo essay follows in pages one to five.  2. May I request that if you have any comments to offer, that you please reply to this post only. This way we don’t have everything split into six different places. Fair enough?  3. If you enjoy this photo essay – it was an enormous amount of work – and would like to see more, then please say so, as I need some positive reinforcement to repeat the effort for other trips!  Thanks a lot, eh?  4. Only after I spent about six or eight hours photoshopping, resizing and uploading all the photos at 700 pixels width [the normal size for internet forums] did I realize that this place automatically resizes bigger images to around 500 pixels.  Arg, all that hard work.  So please do me a favour and click on the image to see it in full size!  5. The shortcut is to click the photo in the black border at its top edge, then hit “F11” to expand it immediately to a full page.  After you look at it, you can hit “Alt + F4” together to close the window [rather than clicking on the X in the top right corner].   Thanks.  6. So grab a cup of coffee or a glass of beer [depending on whether you are reading this before or after Changeover Time] and enjoy! I’m warning you it’s going to take you a while to read, so make sure your vessel is fully topped up.  You can click here to begin our May 2006 Algonquin Park photo essay.  Cheers, Pete [and Ron]"
63181,Guest gbfisher,2007-04-22 02:29:00,0,couple of pics and a short description of your trip would have been great. Like the shot of the old guy with a very nice trout on this page. Missed the others..hope I posted where I was supposed to...  !  Good luck with your next post ........

Yeah, it was a ton of work, that's for sure!  Probably put in about twelve to sixteen hours what with all the photoshopping, uploading, writing, copying and pasting, and fixing links.  I definitely appreciate some positive feedback!  THANKS!"

I know how long that must have taken you to do, so thanks for sharing.  I love Algonquin, so this report was very interesting to me.  What a great place to spend some quality time with family.  Looks like you caught lots of nice fish and a good time was had by all.  Thanks again. Good luck this year. Look forward to the report (though a slightly shorter one would I'm sure be just as interesting and less time consuming for you).  007"

It must be wonderful to share a trip like that with your dad.  My dad and I fish together 90% of the time but Algonquin is one trip he won't come on with us.  He is not much for canoes or sleeping on the ground.  Good luck this year and I think we are all looking forward to another photo essay.  Harv

63277,mepps,2007-04-22 14:30:00,1301,"nice report!  A friendly tip for for helping the dial up users, make the image size under 100k each - the image at the top is 500 x 382 pixels and 156k, it could have been compressed to under 70k without a noticable differance in quality.  Even at 640x480 you can have an image bellow 100k in size.  heres an example of a 640x480 image that is only 54k in size. Should load really quickly for dial up users! "

The trouble with multi-part posts is scattered comments... people asking the same Q's in different threads etc. Instead of different threads try blogging your report and start a thread with a link to your blog. Guy's, cut this man some slack. I want to see more reports like this. Pete, maybe next trip you can carry the pack while your father carries the 3 OZ digital camara  -Brian"

63930,Rich Clemens,2007-04-23 23:37:00,3131,Nice detailed reports and loads of pics of your adventure.  Really enjoyed the view and the read.   Sounds like you put a lot of time into the posts and it shows.   Thanks for the opportunity to share your trip - must have been a great one.  Trips like that with your father are worth a life-time of memories.
