I am going to try saturday morning for the first time. Is it worth trying, or should I stick to huron tribs?   Thanks for any input!!  P.s. I am already aware of the regs for Big Creek."
777686,Rich,2013-04-05 11:02:00,3927,Last time I went I saw a guy walking out with two colored up dropbacks on a stringer. We didn't get any. Good luck

777744,sauce,2013-04-05 18:52:00,219,New regs don't list big creek in year round open season. Instead they have it listed as extended fall season.  Or am I missing something?
777748,Rich,2013-04-05 19:32:00,3927,Yep. You're missing the exceptions.
777758,sauce,2013-04-05 20:37:00,219,"I just checked again. Not in the exceptions. In ""additional opportunities"""
