777767,Roy,2013-04-05 20:55:00,13728,Weren't they supposed to have numbers on them?
777768,davey buoy,2013-04-05 21:01:00,5505,Lake Simcoe must have #'s on them. Not so sure about other zones though.
777771,TJQ,2013-04-05 21:02:00,7806,Ya.. thats why they cant get ahold of the guy..
777773,ketchenany,2013-04-05 21:20:00,3229,"We had huge huts on Simcoe for years and with numbers! Always took them off on time. No fail. The there were no regulation on how big the numbers had to be. I wrote then in pencil at about 6 point. I was never asked where the numbers were. COs that cMe by we're great guys, they loved our decorations in and out.  I had one window with a dismantled TV front buttons and all and a thermostat that worked.  A lot more to keep us happy. Maybe someone recalls the huts with the 'flags' off Oro 9, those were the days! Even a plane landed because of the flags indicating wind direction!"

Came to close to hitting a submerged one half way down Kempenfelt Bay approx.  10 years ago with our fiberglass boat, gets the heart pumping for sure."
777778,fishindevil,2013-04-05 21:50:00,6254,Huts that are not portables must have numbers that corespond with the zone that its in and there is even laws about how big the numbers must be and they must be visible

777962,Rich,2013-04-06 18:24:00,3927,Now whoever owns it is certainly NEVER coming to get it.
