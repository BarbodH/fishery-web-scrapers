777055,Big Cliff,2013-04-02 09:55:00,6899,"The young couple that stayed with us this past winter while going to school here in Lindsay have a bit of a challange and I am hoping we can help them out.  He has just landed a job in Halifax and has to move there for the end of April. She is pregnent and expecting in Aug. they don't have a lot of money but they are both super nice kids and both love fishing.  So, I am looking for anyone that has connections in Halifax, they are looking to rent a three bedroom house. And yes, we've been looking on all the appropriate web sites, there are some available but it would be really nice if they could have some contacts when they get there. Also if anyone knows of a room he could rent there for a week or two until he gets things settled.  I am also trying to find a way we can get their furnature to Halifax for them, they don't have a lot of stuff, it would easily fit in the back of a 5 ton cube van with plenty of room to spare. I thought about renting a U Haul trailer but don't have anything big enough to tow it.  U Haul truck, $2078.00 for a 10' truck which would be big enough but that is a lot of money to move what little stuff they have. If anyone hauls to Halifax and has some room to spare on a trailer and wants to pick up some extra cash that might work.  Thoughts, ideas?"
777057,mercman,2013-04-02 11:27:00,7054,"You are such a good man Cliff   I have no ideas, but i can still help out. I know how tough it is for young people to make a start at things, and if you believe in them strong enough to go this far to help them, then i am willing to help them too. Put me down for a 100$ donation to help them with the move. PM me with any details Cliff."
777069,Big Cliff,2013-04-02 12:36:00,6899,"Wow Paul, that is so typical of you. You don't even know them, might never even meet them but as usual step right up and offer to help. I am going to keep your offer on the back burner for the time being if that is ok with you. I would like to try to find a way to help them without bailing them out with cash if we can.  If anyone has a small truck that we could borrow/ rent, I would be willing to drive their stuff down there for them,  I figure if I can find a co-driver we could do the return trip in three days allowing for loading, unloading, and traveling time. It is about 3500 KM round trip from here."
777335,mercman,2013-04-03 10:50:00,7054,"No problem Cliff. You just let me know, and i will have it on its way in a heartbeat. Would be nice to get a few more suggestions from others though. I know there is someone out there just itching to help!  Isn't there?"
777336,Big Cliff,2013-04-03 11:22:00,6899,"Ya, I'm a little surprised that no one else has chimed in, I'm not looking for donations! They are willing to rent a truck and cover all the expenses, they just can't afford the $2078.00 bucks U Haul would cost. I sort of thought someone on here might be able to offer some ideas on how we could help these kids. It isn't like they are sitting on their butts looking for a hand out, just a bit of a hand.  They are both hard workers and have invested their money in getting good educations, that is starting to pay off as he has just been offered a really good job in Halifax. I thought it would be nice if we could help them along and do a good deed."
777338,motv8tr,2013-04-03 12:01:00,2587,"Cliff, it's a long shot,. but I sent a link to this thread to one of my cousins, her husband is from Newfoundland, but went to school in Halifax,  and they lived there for a year when they were first married.  They may know some people there still so I thought I'd give her a try....it's a long shot, but I'll let you know what I hear....   Ok, my cousin has sent messages to those she knows and has asked her husband to do the same, will let you know if anything come from that.  Also my cousin sent me this tip to pass on to the couple  ""Just a comment on the moving of their stuff thread: it was cheaper for us to get a company called ""cheapest way to move"" to move everything than to rent a u-haul. I would advise the couple to look at that. It was like $1500 for Cheapest Way, and they even loaded and unloaded the truck. I *highly* recommend that. Esp since she's pregnant."" Maureen"
777346,Big Cliff,2013-04-03 13:52:00,6899,"Thanks Maureen, that is the kind of help we are looking for, every little bit helps."
777353,cisco,2013-04-03 14:59:00,597,"Just an idea. I went to Kijiji and searched 'cube van'. Got several in the $2,300. range. Oldies but goodies and if you guys are mechanically inclined you can check em out. Buy one and when to the east coast sell it. Sales pitch would be something like... ""Just drove it here so she works good!"" One was a 1884 Ford 350 cube with 116,000 km with all kindsa new stuff that the seller says is being sold becouse he's selling his business. Black and has a sharks smile but ugly is good cuz nobody steals ugly. LOL!  Seriously, say $3,000 or less investment and recoup most of it when done with it. I know people who have been very successful doing this with cars when they came from out west."

777361,Big Cliff,2013-04-03 15:36:00,6899,Good thought! We'll look into that one too. Thanks!
777366,ketchenany,2013-04-03 16:23:00,3229,How about insurannce costs if you buy and sell?
777369,Big Cliff,2013-04-03 17:31:00,6899,My insurance covers me no matter what I am driving so that won't be a problem. Good thought though!
777375,BillM,2013-04-03 17:52:00,17367,"Cliff, definitely check out uship.com/ca..     You can get guys to bid on what you need shipped.  Might be surprised!"

777415,motv8tr,2013-04-03 20:11:00,2587,"Here is the first reply my cousin received from her contact in Halifax.... """
777422,Old Ironmaker,2013-04-03 20:28:00,8243,"Big Cliff,  I haven't posted because I hate promising something that I can't make happen.  To make a long story short I have brother and sis in law out in Sackville just outside the city of Halifax. Dave has a business there and was born and bred. He did have rental properties but sold them before the recession. He said 3 bedrooms are hard to find but will ask around, but needs what they plan on budgeting for not including utilities. Good point. Also looking online is their best bet. He is in Halifax almost daily and his business takes him all over the city. If they find something they are interested in he is willing to take a ride by and check it out. Another  good point is that Halifax is like any other city there are places you would want to live in and places you don't want to be in after dark. With him knowing every neighborhood he will be able to tell if it's somewhere one would want to live in just by the address. He said to check out rentals in Dartmouth which neighbours Halifax. Less expensive for same accommodations. Like Burlington and Hamilton.  As far as moving I agree that hiring a mover may cost less in the long run. That "" Cheapest Way "" sounds interesting. Liability insurance coverage and references are key when hiring a mover. I drove out a few years ago in my new Silverado when gas was $1.05 and if I remember correctly fuel ran around $1000.00 and by the time I got to Halifax gas was about 30 cents more, plus motels for 5 nights was  around $500.00, I know we have to eat whether home or away but I don't eat out 3 times a day, Tim Horton's, Subway and Mickey D's is going to be $50.00 minimum a day on the road. I personally always make sandwiches from scratch and buy salads when on the road more for health reasons than convenience. So one needs to take all expenses into consideration. I would look into driving a U Haul cube out, leave it there and fly back. Crunch the numbers. By the time you factor in all costs it might be less, even if it's around the same you are saving time as well as the wear and tear on a personal vehicle.  I personally would never buy something here and hope to sell upon arrival unless I had someone at the other end to do it for me. As well any vehicle I drove a long distance better get me there without worrying about dropping a tranny etc. Especially pulling a load. I'm sure you know yourself how ridiculous repairs are today.  PM me for more details and I'll give you my phone number.  Johnny D"
777425,Big Cliff,2013-04-03 21:18:00,6899,"Wow, some really helpful tips here! Thanks so much! I do know that they would like to be outside of the city, they have two (very well behaved and very clean) dogs so they are hoping to find something with a yard or area that the dogs can run. These kids are not sissies by any means, both have spent time in Labrador working way out in the bush. He is a wild life specialist and spent many years trapping coyoties and other critters and tagging them.  She has a degree in environmental studies so she is quite at home in the country. They have been looking at places on Kijijji and things but it is a little hard to know what you are getting into when you are so far away.  Johnny, I'll pass this info along to them, he is in Hamilton on a training course for the new job right now but will be here on Saturday.  Thanks again for all your help everyone! if anyone else has any ideas please keep them coming, more is better!"
777435,Loonietoon,2013-04-03 21:45:00,1450,Cliff I will match Pauls  100.00
777436,Loonietoon,2013-04-03 21:46:00,1450,Cliff I will match Pauls  100.00  If he is in Hamilton and needs any thing just let me know..
777446,DRIFTER_016,2013-04-03 22:55:00,10439,  That's what I did when I moved my stuff from Ontario to the NWT. I paid $5500 for the truck spent $1500 on gas and sold the truck for $6500 up here. The net cost was $500 for gas plus the cost of a hitch to pull my boat and cerification/plating etc. The move really only cost me in the area of $1000. U-Haul wanted $5000+ for the truck rental plus the gas it woud have cost me $7K+ for the move.
777464,Old Ironmaker,2013-04-04 01:00:00,8243,"Good to know they have 2 dogs, that sure makes renting a place a bit more difficult. That is some very helpful info. Give us the W5, who, what, when, where ,why? Much easier to find a place, it will be much easier knowing a rural area is a consideration.  Some quick questions for example.  How far are they willing to commute?  Is it a single family home they are looking for vs. attached condo, townhouse?  Are they looking for a large yard or acreage?  Again and most important, what is their budget? No sense looking if we don't know how much they can afford.  Need more info big guy.  Thinking about it yes they are going to be there and have the time to sell a truck and trailer or a cube van once they have settled in. Good option.  It's very charitable to offer cash, many here can afford it but they are both educated professionals that don't seem to be in dire straits. Do what your heart tells you to but I personally believe these two kids don't need charity and others that truly need it would be helped by giving to the charity of your choice, a women's shelter comes to mind or your local food bank. Just my opinion. "
777507,Big Cliff,2013-04-04 09:52:00,6899,"I'll talk to them when he gets back home on Saturday  and get some answers for you.  While the offers of cash are very generous, much appreciated,  and so typical of the wonderful people on this board , I don't think that is required as much as trying to help them solve the bigger problem; finding a place to live from 1700 km away and getting their stuff there!  I was also kind of hoping that if there was a member of this board that lived in the area or had family in the area they would be willing to kind of help the kids get to know their way around and make it easier for them to get settled."
777640,mcdougy,2013-04-05 00:46:00,274,"Could be a long shot, but worth a phone call. Call Ryder and see if they need any vehicles driven to Halifax, I know when I just purchased a cube van from them, I was considering bringing a unit in from Halifax, heck they may even get paid to drive it?"
777682,Big Cliff,2013-04-05 10:14:00,6899,Another good idea. Thanks!
