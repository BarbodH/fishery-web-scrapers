He wasn't just a few feet off shore, he was right out at the chanel. I tried to yell at him to let him know that the ice wasn't safe but either he couldn't hear me or he was just ignoring me. I kept an eye on him just in case and eventually he did come back in to shore.  Friday morning I look out my window and there is open water not more than 25' from where he was fishing. The chanel had opened up within a few hours of him being there. I wonder if he knows how close he came. If he had gone through there wouldn't have been much I could have done to help him without risking my life too. Scary part is I'd have probably tried.  This guy either doesn't know the lake in which case he should never have gone out or figured it was worth the risk to see if he could catch some fish.  Unless you REALLY KNOW what the ice conditions are stay off the ice!"

777915,captpierre,2013-04-06 13:28:00,2521,Darwin at work  Same reason deer/moose deliver their young so easily.  Obstetrical problems result in the elimination of those genes.
