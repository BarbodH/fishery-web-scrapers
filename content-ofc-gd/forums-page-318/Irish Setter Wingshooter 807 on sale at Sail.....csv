This is a great price for this boot.  They are not on the Sail website or in the flyer so it may only be at the Burlington location (?).  I tried them on and walked around the store for half an hour and these boots are really comfortable. Just finished greasing them up with mink oil and am going out for a walk to work them in a bit, though they don't feel like they really need too much working in.  http://hunt.irishsetterboots.com/irishsetter-shoe/807-irish-setter/807-irish-setter-mens-wingshooter-auburn  Burt"
