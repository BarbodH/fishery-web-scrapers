777486,Old Ironmaker,2013-04-04 02:07:00,8243,"Wow, never seen that before, a pike taking a smaller pike sideways but not a bass taking one the same size head first. I don't think it's a feeding thing, most likely 2 males one protecting a bed trying to kill the other. Has to be aggressive behavior. All I can say is wow.  Thanks woodenboater, great video, I don't think it's doctored, it looks real for sure but with what they can do with computers can we be sure? If it is CGI the guy should win an Emmy."

777530,ch312,2013-04-04 16:27:00,1590,"talk about a bad case of having ""eyes bigger than your belly""!  minnows in my tank often take pieces of food that are too large and choke themselves out. there can be a ton of smaller pieces floating around that are perfect for them, yet they insist on being greedy. i guess bass are the same as anyone who has cast some muskie size baits in bass waters may know."
