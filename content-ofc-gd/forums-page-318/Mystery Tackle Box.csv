You pay a monthly (or yearly) fee and each month you receive atleast $15 worth of product. The idea is they send you new or popular stuff to try out, and they include cards which help you in using your new bait. I may try it out for 1 or 2 months just to see what I get out of it. Might be a cool way to try out products that I normally would have NEVER tried.  http://mysterytacklebox.com/  MONTHLY Good value $15.00  3 MONTH Great value $43.50  6 MONTH Amazing value $85.50  12 MONTH Best value $165.00  Could be a cool gift for a fisherfriend as well. I know I would love getting a package in the mail monthly with cool new lures to try.  Any thoughts?"
778140,Terry,2013-04-07 19:27:00,14456,could be banjo minnows and helicopter jigs and a   Popeil pocket fisherman
778152,adempsey,2013-04-07 20:08:00,1498,"Reminds me of the days of the music or book clubs.   Although, I don't think it uses the same marketing strategy.   What I do know is they are sure advertising this a lot.   If you go to there website I believe you can see what things they have included in past months.  If you think you'll enjoy it, go for it.  You could always cancel it."
778158,Luke V.,2013-04-07 21:01:00,286,My girlfriend got me a year subscription for my birthday this year!!!!!!  It's great!!!  March's box     Luke
778164,SlowPoke,2013-04-07 21:49:00,2984,It's not a rip off but it's not something I have any interest in. You'll get your monies worth but it's like asking your sister's best friends niece to go shopping for you.
778190,BillM,2013-04-08 00:19:00,17367,"I'd rather pick out my own stuff at BPS, lol."
778203,Fisherman,2013-04-08 00:50:00,7201,"It's taking a bit of a chance, if half the stuff doesn't apply to the species you normally target, then half your money is thrown out the door."
778211,Live2fish85,2013-04-08 01:27:00,1633,I know a guy that gets that and he got some soft plastic that's leafs lol. At least it looks like that haha. As others said. I would rather know what I am getting and get what I want.
778222,EC1,2013-04-08 02:22:00,930,"I received a 3 month subscription for Christmas. Good stuff, and you get way more than what you pay for. Also, my boxes came with a coupon code ""GET499"" for an extra discount. It got better and better each month since January, but it also gave me some stuff I don't think I'd ever be using.  There seems to be a more expensive (hard bait or frog) each month, and then a few packs of plastics, and a pack of Mustad EWG's. The plastics come in packs of 3 or 4, and would let you sample the baits. What I do applaud them for, is offering baits in colours that you can't go wrong with.  Live2Fish, the ""leaf"" has a pretty awesome action in the water! Look it up on youtube!"
778274,Angler management,2013-04-08 14:59:00,280,"Fishhound.com has the same deal, but you can actually pick the stuff you get to test. And its yours to keep once you write a report on what u think about the product. Also its much cheaper."
778332,d_paluch,2013-04-08 22:47:00,343,"That site is cool! Might sign up. The thing I do like about mysterytacklebox, is that it would almost force me to try different techniques if I got them in the box, which otherwise I more than likely wouldn't have tried.  Time to research!"
