777402,davey buoy,2013-04-03 19:16:00,5505,"Looks good!!!,I think some of us may have forgotten about them.Been a while for me.I have the net but continually miss the runs ."
777411,lew,2013-04-03 19:48:00,12766,"That feed of smelts sure does look good and brings back lotsa memories.  For years we'd go down the  Lake O shoreline and fill a few buckets, then go home and fry them up and have a feast. Haven't done it for probably 40 years now but I still remember how good they tasted."
777412,ecmilley,2013-04-03 19:49:00,2163,lew you got the net we can head over to simcoe for some smelts
777413,lew,2013-04-03 19:53:00,12766,"The net rotted away long ago Ernie, along with the 10' bamboo pole"
777916,Jen,2013-04-06 13:31:00,833,"We catch them one by one while ice fishing, it passes the time and great way to compete... little red yarn in the tackle box always saves the day when the bite is slow... and makes for a yummy meal when you get home.  Looks like you had a great treat!"
777925,Rod Caster,2013-04-06 13:50:00,5784,"I used up the last of my smelts fishing for lakers in February.  I'm hoping we can pin down the run again this year...speaking of which, I need to visit somebody with a bag of ""land-use walleye"""
777928,moxie,2013-04-06 13:54:00,1566,Been quite a while.
777979,Beans,2013-04-06 19:33:00,3339,They used to be in Wilmot Creek as thick as thieves about the same time trout season opened...could alway grab a few for a feed if the trout didn't co-operate...(fifty years ago)
