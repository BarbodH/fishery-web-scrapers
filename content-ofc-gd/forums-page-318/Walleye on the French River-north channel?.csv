777821,Pigeontroller,2013-04-06 00:17:00,2793,Going up to the Boss's cottage on 18 Mile Island for a guys weekend on the May 24. I'm no walleye angler but it would be nice to fry a few up for the guys. Anyone fish that part of the French in May? I'd appreciate any tips!
777864,dhickey,2013-04-06 02:05:00,1038,Thanks for giving me somthing to look at and think about. Last time I checked there are alot of protected grounds for up there for pickeral. But that was about 6 yrs ago things may have changed? If you plan on going into the bay keep your head up .  She gets nasty REAL FAST....  Good luck.
777866,Pigeontroller,2013-04-06 02:08:00,2793,"Sorry, should've been more specific! I mean the North Channel of the French River."
777871,kickingfrog,2013-04-06 02:18:00,8333,I find a nice strip of belly meat from a 55inch ski works better then worms for eyes.
777877,dhickey,2013-04-06 02:43:00,1038,You should try porkbely or try the gullet out of a sucker?? Just sayin.
777888,chris.brock,2013-04-06 04:44:00,4053,"I'm pretty familiar with that section of the French. The walleye fishing is pretty tough. With the late spring, I'd try under the bridge in Green Bay and around Cedar Rapids. Where's his cottage (ie Ash Bay, Green Bay)?"
777941,Raf,2013-04-06 15:07:00,3495,arent many secrets there.  the walleye may be congregated and so will the boats.  just look for them below moving water.
777959,Pigeontroller,2013-04-06 18:11:00,2793,Cottage is just across from Rainbow camp...
777961,Rich Clemens,2013-04-06 18:21:00,3131,Which cottage is that ?   We go to Rainbow every September.   Got two weeks there this year
778012,Pigeontroller,2013-04-06 23:32:00,2793,"Not really sure Rich, never been there. The Owners are Greg and Demeter, they have a red & white fish and ski...Greg has a Weimaraner thats probably running around alot!"
778013,Rich Clemens,2013-04-06 23:40:00,3131,"Can't think of which that may be - there are a number across on the island and most of the way down to Green Bay.  Never tried for Walleye up there, biut I've seen a few folks here and there.   Some were parked up River around the narrows - on the downward side, but that was in September.   Take a few picks and make me jealous and anxious.   Best of luck to you."
