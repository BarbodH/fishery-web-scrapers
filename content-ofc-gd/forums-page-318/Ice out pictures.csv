777360,Big Cliff,2013-04-03 15:34:00,6899,Open water in the Scugog River where it opens into Goose Bay. I'm thinking at least two weeks before we can get a boat in the water though.

778362,passthepitonspete,2013-04-09 00:44:00,64,"Have a look here at high res satellite images.  They are current, and if there is no cloud cover, you can easily see the ice conditions of any given lake.  Man, I'm hoping for some warm, windy and sunny weather.  http://coastwatch.glerl.noaa.gov/modis/region_map.html"
778368,Old Ironmaker,2013-04-09 01:00:00,8243,"Crappie,  Where exactly? We had ice out here in February, boats were in Long Point Bay last month, saw freighters on the move March 15."
