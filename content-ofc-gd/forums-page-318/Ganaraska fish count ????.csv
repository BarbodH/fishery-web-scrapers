775451,chessy,2013-03-24 23:52:00,610,"in 2011 there was some questions on how the numbers of the trout run went from  6313 on the counter to the mnr number of 9058 .    Some of you may remember a disagreement at a public meeting on how the mnr came to these numbers  .Well last year there was a big metal screen put in so no fish could get through last spring 2012 and we counted  7250  and the mnr came up with 8525. I have no idea how they came up with these numbers as they did not know there was a screen in-place to stop the fish (there was not fish at the ladder until after the counter went in ) . I still have not been able to get the ""formula"" for there fish count . So that is approximately a 15 percent difference last year ????"
775690,Thrilla,2013-03-26 14:42:00,164,Has the count started this year? I would think some would have started running?
775699,Sinker,2013-03-26 15:50:00,8692,I think they started doing some work at the ladder this week.  S.
775706,chessy,2013-03-26 16:28:00,610,yup issues with the ladder the ladder is open but NO counter in ..
776336,Twocoda,2013-03-30 02:09:00,4130,They added HST....
776348,Sinker,2013-03-30 03:31:00,8692,Counter might be in now. I was down there on thursday and they were working on things and doing training. GRCA put a boom across the river abovve the dam as well.  S.
776412,chessy,2013-03-30 16:40:00,610,counter is now it it was in yesterday late in the day .. we now have 67 fish through the counter as of midnight last night...  the water temperature is 0c as of 10 am   . would have been nice if the GRCA put the boom across river the right way..
776426,Sinker,2013-03-30 18:06:00,8692,"What's the right way for the boom? According to you it seems bobody does anything right lol  The boom is going to be a kid magnet if you ask me. Kids will be all over it! It. Will probably create safety issues, not prevent them!  S."
776488,chessy,2013-03-30 21:59:00,610,There is to be no bow in the boom it is to lead people to the shore not stuck in middle the only reason I know is the mnr engineer was scratching his head and explained how it was to go. And I know alot because I ask question  there is no law on questions lol
776489,chessy,2013-03-30 22:00:00,610,There is already foot steps on the boom at the exit of the ladder
776496,Sinker,2013-03-30 22:23:00,8692,Looks pretty straight to me........?  
776607,chessy,2013-03-31 14:16:00,610,"its not meant to be straight it is to be on a angle to lead people to shore, who may get stuck on said boom .. and i am just saying what the mnr engineer said. i have been on that river for  all my life and there has never been a boom there, once they identify a problem they must make it correct"
776632,Sinker,2013-03-31 15:56:00,8692,"Looks like that's all the angle they could get. It has to be fastened to something (the dam), so that's all the angle your gonna get. Not GRCA's fault, and it wasn't their decision to install it either. Maybe the MNR engineer should have offered some suggestions instead of standing around watching. I saw about 15 guys there, and only 2 actually working lol.  S."
776722,chessy,2013-04-01 00:02:00,610,"lol there were only 2 guys working and if i saw that i would be driving over and asking why only two guys out of 14 working .. with that said only 4 were mnr the rest were volunteers and it was a bi yearly fall arrest course for saftey.  and you may be correct but once the navagation act goes through it will need to be removed as it will not be needed ??? next time you are in the area stop by, have a good one"
777426,chessy,2013-04-03 21:18:00,610,159 fish now over the ladder and through the counter
777527,FloatnFly,2013-04-04 16:18:00,1640,well lets hope that number is off by a few thousand lol looking forward to swinging some flies on opener
777545,esoxansteel,2013-04-04 18:11:00,1307,"Thanx for the update Jase, people will have to fish other waters with the very very low number over the ladder, and not much in the lower river as well  take your 3 weights horned chub should be on dries by then"
777560,Garnet,2013-04-04 20:03:00,2056,The water is 32 and the trout can't make it over. When the temp hits 42.3 look out.
777566,Old Ironmaker,2013-04-04 21:15:00,8243," Chessy you are correct when you say you learn by asking questions. What is the purpose of the boom? What do you mean lead people to shore, who may get stuck on it. Why would somebody be on it?  I probably would not ask however why only 2 people working while 12 watch. Otherwise that's all I would be doing when I am driving around the county. (that's a laugh out loud comment)"
777604,chessy,2013-04-04 23:08:00,610,the purpose of the boom is so people do not get washed over the dam if they capsize their boat on the water . if they do the boom is suppose to lead them to show so they do not have to fight the current )act like a weir and help you go in a certain direction  at least that is what i was told when it was being installed
777623,Old Ironmaker,2013-04-05 00:21:00,8243,"Yes of course now that I look closer and the boom has written on it danger dam ahead, thanks, and love your video of the flying fish."
