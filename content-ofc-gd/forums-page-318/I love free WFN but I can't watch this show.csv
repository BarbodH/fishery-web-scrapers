777875,BillM,2013-04-06 02:37:00,17367, Krupas shows were the best...
777285,Rich Nelson,2013-04-02 23:20:00,332,"Yep, Beyond the Cast. Great show."
777286,MCTFisher9120,2013-04-02 23:31:00,3761,"saltwater crap and salmon crap...no thanks, bassin shows are the reason wfn is in tv"
777289,bigugli,2013-04-03 00:03:00,6138,I discontnued WFN over a year back. Kept falling asleep in the middle of  shows. No appeal to  me at all any more.  My toe jam and ear wax collection is more interesting.
777312,GBW,2013-04-03 01:24:00,8460,I bet that's true BUT its still better than other shows out there.
777332,Sharkbait22,2013-04-03 10:38:00,297,I have a soft spot for almost any fishing in BC.  The Big Coast is mainly about downrigging with mooching gear but sometimes they go old school with many pulls and heavy sinkers.  I much prefer rivers but they they frequently fish Barkley Sound Broken Islands Group part of Pacific Rim NP.  I proposed to my wife on a fish/camping trip out on Turret Island. Those Big Coast guys have a wicked little floating cottage in one of the bays. The vistas and wildlife are amazing.  I could retire/move there one day.
777343,wkrp,2013-04-03 13:12:00,656,I enjoy watching Lunkerville. Real people.
777407,DRIFTER_016,2013-04-03 19:31:00,10439, It's a good one but my favorite BC show is Sport Fishing on the Fly. Awesome lake and river fishing.   :good:  http://www.sfotf.ca/
777420,davey buoy,2013-04-03 20:22:00,5505,I agree!!! i also like the new fly fisher Dave.
777424,Lunker Larry,2013-04-03 20:50:00,122," In the military, I was posted to Masset on the Queen Charlotte Islands (now Haida Gwai (?)) Anyway, I was spoiled and like you, loved the river fishing. Sea run coho, kings and steelhead were amazing and the rest of the time, well, you just had to settle for Dolley Vardin and Cut Throat trout, thats when you weren't jigging halibut, red snapper or pulling up dungeness crabs or collecting garbage bags of razor clams on the beach. Four and a half years of being spoiled. Just had to get used to fishing in the rain"
777443,Sharkbait22,2013-04-03 22:31:00,297,Wow thanks. I use to watch SFOTF when in Alberta but I don't get the show under my current programming.  But it looks like the episodes are on the net.  Thanks. Masset - did you watch the story on Russ George dumping iron rich rock into the water.  It aired on CBC a few nights ago.  2.5 mil for the promise of fish. Crazy.
777450,Kerry,2013-04-03 23:30:00,383,"I usually PVR Musky Hunter, The Next Bite and Simply Fishing,my favourites to watch-fish with teeth.However I really like the Australian Fishing Championships and cant wait for the repeats to be over.I like the format and the species are different but also much the same ways to target.Go team Tackle Junkie! Kerry"
777501,Old Ironmaker,2013-04-04 03:47:00,8243,"I get more info from JP DeRosa (sic) than wandering around Gander Mountain for 2 hours. As far as Italo, man he's really the only person in the world I would like to put on the end of a line and troll for a few hours. I know some people that know him personally and apparently he is as irritating in real life as on TV. Only in real life he preaches his ministry to boot, he is a jack of all trades, did you know he is a teaching golf professional as well as someone that sells a different line of boats every year?  Another reason Al Linder who used to be my hero has lost a viewer, I don't need a catechism class at the end of every show.  Can't stand the west coast shows. Watching a guy troll for a half hour isn't entertaining for me.  I just realized I haven't watched WFN for months, why exactly am I paying for it?  Anyone out there want to produce a real fishing show? The one where a bunch of guys spend a week together at a camp once a year, make an excuse for not to go fishing, go into town to watch the peelers, get into a fight with the locals, go back to camp, make an excuse not to go fishing, drink some more, play euchre and get into a fight with each other. Now that is a real Canadian fishing show."
777512,Harrison,2013-04-04 12:24:00,2202," Replace ""fishing"" with ""hunting"" and we can film a reality show at my camp."
777517,TDunn,2013-04-04 14:23:00,680,      LOL!!
777523,Dontcryformejanhrdina,2013-04-04 15:35:00,535,"You can tell he makes people uncomfortable when he puts his arm around them and talks/yells into their ear for the next minute while they're holding a fish. Plus he's obsessed with sausages, even if they are one of his sponsors.  I like watching musky hunter and occasionally The Next Bite."
777540,mr blizzard,2013-04-04 17:44:00,1589,"Couldn't beat old Red , loved the show Maybe one day they'll come back on along with the Beachcombers"
777543,shane,2013-04-04 18:05:00,652, And   'Adventures in Rainbow Country'.  I lived and breathed that show when I was a kid.
777551,davey buoy,2013-04-04 18:44:00,5505,Myself as well!!
777567,Moosebunk,2013-04-04 21:18:00,3970,"Will still watch old Bobber I-to-the-zumi from time to time.  Caught part of yesterdays on WFN, when he was fishing in front of the Pick Nuke Plant for browns.  Kinda enjoyed that!  His guide was funny.  Was the first episode too that he pimped some Abu stuff.  That's gotta be a bit of an adjustment for the man.  PVR Uncut, and will stop and watch Musky Hunter or Esox if on.  Other than that, I'm with Dan... I'd like to see more far off places in HD with that nutbar Krupa.   Ohhh and to add... Adventures North.  It's old school good!"
777572,Old Ironmaker,2013-04-04 21:30:00,8243,"Love Fishing Adventurer, caught an episode today on ""rad x"" network. Kayak fishing with Montr√©al skyline in the background. One guy actually reached down while wading  and lifted out a Sturgeon about 3' long, very neat."
777589,danc,2013-04-04 22:24:00,4677," I probably should have said that I enjoyed all of Krupa's shows Drew, but the Labrador Brookie episode is epic. I so want to take a few casts from loverboy rock some day! A nutbar for sure. But a very entertaining nutbar. Also, not all HD is created equal, but Krupas shows are among the best HD productions that I've ever seen. Just beautiful stuff."
777606,GBW,2013-04-04 23:13:00,8460,"If I recall, his guide was Taro and he IS a NUT!  I would rather fish with Taro any day over 85%+ of the show hosts out there."
777635,Old Ironmaker,2013-04-05 00:40:00,8243,"As the kids say Taro is "" da bomb "", your going to be seeing a lot more of him I predict. his personality is unique, I can listen to his honest enthusiasm all day long. I think he will get his own gig if there is a smart producer out there, but you're going to love him or hate him. His charter service is about to explode.  Mark Krupa is an outdoor writer and photographer, he is also a struggling Canadian actor, have seen him in few Canadian movies, television episodes and direct to video releases. I agree the production quality of his shows are far better than most shot in HD."
777646,Moosebunk,2013-04-05 01:06:00,3970," Exactly Dan!  And yeah... think the Sutton specks as well as the Fortress Lake BC speck episodes were solid too!  Loverboy Rock... yeah... you're so 80's man! j/k.  I remember that spot in the show surprisingly.   Nowadays Taro would be put on Ritalin if he was a child... Luckily for him he's got fishing as an adult.  Yeah... he was a giggler in that episode, but that's cool.   He was is that and an enthusiastic angler too.  Overall... doing alright for himself for sure."
777856,Radnine,2013-04-06 01:47:00,1538, The only way that Red will come back is if somebody is beach combing and his decomposed body washes up (still clutching a book of his poems!) Jim
776644,Old Ironmaker,2013-03-31 16:51:00,8243,"I think most have outgrown the half hour infomercials as well. Watching an overfed guy  with more logos on his shirt than a Nascar body reel in a fish is getting old. I find myself screaming at the screen What are you using ??????? Either all they talk about is the lure or nothing at all, must be a somewhere in between.  If I hear Italo explain which fingers of which hand he is using to remove a hook one more time I'm going to upchuck, right Barb honey? And I still watch, oh my."
776645,DRIFTER_016,2013-03-31 16:52:00,10439,"Anybody watch Maximum Limit Fishing on WILD tv? Maxim is a Yellowknifer and his show is about as average angler as you are likely to see these days. Most of his shows are in and around Yellowknife fishing lakers, whitefish, pike and grayling. It's cool that his local show was picked up by WILD tv."
776651,lookinforwalleye,2013-03-31 17:06:00,4399,Lol you mean you don't like being spoken too like a 5 year old?
776654,FloatnFly,2013-03-31 17:17:00,1640,best thing about wfn....fly fishing tuesday!
776655,kickingfrog,2013-03-31 17:22:00,8333,"Another aspect of a show that increases the likelihood that I'll watch it is the ""Would I want to spend a day fishing with this guy?"" factor.  In other words, I'll spend more time watching someone I like catch 1.5lb bass, then a loudmouth catching10 plus pound walleye or 50 inch muskie.  The X factor is we all have different preferences in fishing partners. The world would be an awfully boring place if we all liked the same thing."
776719,ckrb2007,2013-03-31 23:55:00,449,I cringe everytime I hear John Gillespie's voice. lol
776742,rob v,2013-04-01 01:49:00,535,"there's plenty on there I don't enjoy, but I don't mind pvr'ing and watching on my time - and skip the commercials (i mean the ones between the info-mercials).   Bottom line I enjoy the sport - can't get out as much as I'd like and sometimes this is a next best option.  with that said I like watching curling too !!"
776810,Lunker Larry,2013-04-01 13:35:00,122,"As with most here, I get tired of seeing ""pros"" whooping and hollering over guppy sized fish while expounding on the virtues of the bait they are using. Of the basic fishing show, I still enjoy Charlie Wray's Fishful Thinking. Yes he pushes product, but his shows remain interesting. I check WFN out ever time it is free on Rogers which reinforces why I don't subscribe to it. Now, if you want to watch a good fishing show, check out Wicked Tuna. I came across it the other night for the first time (on the history channel I think) and watched about 10 episodes in a row. Yes it is a reality show with interesting characters (feigned or not) but it is really unique."
776812,Lunkerhunter,2013-04-01 13:40:00,455," hey Lew, there are a few new musky shows on WFN now. keyes outdoors and fishing with joe bucher. both do push certain sponsors as much as the rest of them but some good musky fishing on both of them for sure."
776813,Lunkerhunter,2013-04-01 13:41:00,455, me too!! he sounds like he is yelling pretty much all the time!! hahahahaha
776815,lew,2013-04-01 13:44:00,12766," Thank ya Sir, I'll watch for them."
776848,ecmilley,2013-04-01 15:41:00,2163,"I prefer shows done on local lakes that i would go to and not the fly-in lodge crap and trolling on tv is even more boring than actually doing it. Sure anyone can fly into nw ontario and catch trophy bass walleye pike on a bare hook or remote parts of bc, qc and nfld for amazing trout and salmon. Fishin canada not to bad for local content that the average joe can get to, Extreme angler another one that targets local to me kawartha/hali/bancroft district lakes for bass/crappies and walleyes. I Like the bass shows myself not all of them but lost lake, scott martin challenge and classic patterns are all great shows that are educational and fun. each there own I guess"
776920,davey buoy,2013-04-01 19:53:00,5505,That's why I like Italo!  He shows a lot of lakes in our area. I know most dissagree .lol.

777024,BillM,2013-04-02 01:46:00,17367,"So condescending, I can't stand listening to him on TV.   Speaks to everyone like they are 5 years old."

He's got good SKILLED people with him like Charles and a few other tourney pro's to lend a hand.  I think it's WFN's best show out there right now.  Too bad I can't say 100% sure what the name is, LOL!  I'm almost sure it's Beyond the Cast but I like it."

My favorites were the old In-fisherman and Babe Winkelman........and we use to have a local show down here in NY called Outdoor Scene with Joe Ognibene that was pretty sweet. He would do fishing shows from Burt Dam LMAO! Those were the days  Nowadays, turning on the Lindners seems more like im attending Sunday mass. Not that theres anything wrong with that.......but its not why i tune into a fishing show. The In-fisherman family must be multi-millionaires at this point with the amount of media they pump out"
777199,Fish4Eyes,2013-04-02 19:15:00,1022,I am really starting to get annoyed with all the saltwater fishing shows. It seems there is no variety. Either bass or saltwater fishing.

776553,Cudz,2013-03-31 03:52:00,2652,I love wfn but I have a real hard time watching any BC salmon show where they are downrigging with those mooching reels.  I can't stand the clicking noise of those reels and they reel like mad forever and the line barely comes in. I change the channel everytime.  I could mute it but I can't be bothered.  I would rather watch some British dude catching chub on 'boileys??' than hear those mooching reels.  Love the saltwater shows especially going for the big stuff.  Now I don't mind hearing those big level wind reels.  Weird.  Likes: Any bass show All the saltwater shows Musky shows 
776554,DRIFTER_016,2013-03-31 03:57:00,10439,I do the same thing when any of those ultra boring bass shows come on.

776587,SirCranksalot,2013-03-31 13:03:00,3291,I get the impression you need a Southern drawl to catch big bass!!

What DOES drive me nuts is when a show insults what fishing intelligence I do have. You have a new plastic bait you want to push? Great. Don't do it on Lake Beauchene and spend 30 mins telling me the success rate is all about the bait. Last week we had a guy in northern Saskachewan casting a spoon for pike and shamelessly pushing how amazing the spoon was. Really? Tie on a 40 year old red devil, the results will be the same. We're not marine biologists but we're far from stupid. If they want to shoot shows there, I get it. Lots of fish = good show. But giving ALL the credit to the marketing subject of the day is irritating."
776591,kemper,2013-03-31 13:18:00,2232,"It's rare that I find a fishing show worth watching.Sometimes  I tune in if they are fishing a lake I know, or would like to learn"

776604,DoubleDigits,2013-03-31 14:04:00,140,"I agree with Cudz on all points here. Despite the nice scenery and fairly good production value, the show that you refer to is just painfully boring."

I mean there was a time when fishing shows and magazines were the only way to get information (and places like the Sportsman Show), now you can click on any website and see what things are like at a particular lodge for instance, rather than hoping that they replay that specific episode of Fish'n Canada. Also, we used to look forward to a Saturday morning fishing show line up and now can watch any episode at any time on any of a bazillion websites that host outdoor shows. Face it boys, we've plum grow'd up! Jim"

The same for fishing magazines because I read just about everything that there was to read during the 60's, 70's and 80's.  Now a days, just the few of the fishing articles that I read in the magazines at the doctor's or dentist's office are enough to keep me informed of anything new.  I do like to see fly fishing and fly tying shows but I would surely get bored easy enough if I ever see too many."

I enjoy watching shows from new areas, and love the saltwater shows, but the bass stuff drives me nuts.  The fishing adventurer, fishn canada, adventures north, and the musky hunter are the only ones I really ""try"" to tune into. I'll watch bob izumi if he's on and not bass fishing too.  The spin on travel that the fishing adventurer has taken is a great idea, and makes for a great show IMO."
