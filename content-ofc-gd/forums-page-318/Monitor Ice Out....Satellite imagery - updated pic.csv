775800,ccmtcanada,2013-03-26 23:30:00,7971,"You can see how parts of Quinte and rivers like the one flowing into Rice Lake are ice free.  Hard to tell, but is the south end of Scugog open water?  The imagery at http://coastwatch.glerl.noaa.gov/modis/region_map.html is a good way to see it happening (assuming it's not a cloudy day).   "
775804,icedude,2013-03-26 23:38:00,459,Absolutely--Find it cool to watch from that perspective as well.  Thanks for the linkage here !   On-the-Ground is a neat experience as well as you probably know.  The Live Sounds of ICE-Out in this region is an annual right of Spring  Have FUN--Play Safe  TightLines  ID1

775851,Handlebarz,2013-03-27 09:59:00,3790,Ice out watch??? Dang I forgot that some places in Ontario actually had good ice this year.  I love the MODIS site been using it for 8 years or so now to help figure out where to go fishing. Awesome shots of the Great Lakes for sure
775852,fishindevil,2013-03-27 10:36:00,6254,Yes it's cool I have been on that site for years as well !!!! There's lots more on that site too like thermal temps of the Great Lakes salmon guys use it a lot you can clearly see the dirty water Comming out of the niagara river too !!!!!
777709,ccmtcanada,2013-04-05 13:20:00,7971,"Slowly coming along! As of yesterday, Quinte is pretty much ice free.  Open spots on Rice....and may of the rivers leading into lakes in the rest of the Kawarthas.  Come on soft water!  "

777766,icedude,2013-04-05 20:55:00,459,Keen eye Fisherman--have learned to always expect this from you .  Probably not appropriate   but--what the Heck?  Orillia Perch Festival April 20-May 11  Winternet or do we wear shorts?  Just a question......... Sheesh !-Relax !  Paul
777769,jedimaster,2013-04-05 21:01:00,3472,"The longterm looks like good daytime temps, but Its not gonna be shorts temps."
777772,DRIFTER_016,2013-04-05 21:05:00,10439, It was -42 with the wind chill this morning. Gonna be a while before our ice melts I think. On a positive note currently they are calling for +3 next Thursday. By Wednesday they will probably change that to -20!!!
777779,Fisherman,2013-04-05 21:52:00,7201,"I was up in Orillia yesterday, on the south side it's open out to the old Government dock, on the north side, it's open to about the first island.  I'm thinking with the rain and temps this week coming we'll be good for opening day, maybe even before that."
777785,misfish,2013-04-05 22:20:00,29133,"I,ll be on open water in the morning."

777975,Beans,2013-04-06 19:23:00,3339,Could be open water Cliff...All lands and water south of  the causeway from Port Perry to Scugog Island and beyond is Private Property and is basically swamp land with shallow weedy water and lots of bullrushes for the sun to reflect off of...
778410,freddyp,2013-04-09 04:20:00,27,"Fisherman, I'm a regular for the festival. But not sure what you mean by the old government dock? What about the public launch @ the end of Collins drive? Is the ice out from there over to the narrows yet? thanks!"
