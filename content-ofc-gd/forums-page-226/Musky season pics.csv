862604,Handlebarz,2014-07-10 23:22:00,3790,Well this year has been a great opener for casting I have seen fish every trip which is great for years past with casting for me now trolling that's a different story but for now we are still in full casting mode. I have not boated anything big enough to get the tape measure out yet and have only taken underwater shots other then a pic my wife took of me taking a fish from the bag. Here are some of the pics. We have had the chance for some big fish but they did not commit for my wife and my buddy John lost a couple big fish. I hope Saturday we find the big ones and get them to stick as Cliff and Will are coming down for their winning bid for the Fish-A-thon auction last year. here are some pics.  First is a catfish that ate my double 10  Fish that was floating and revived to hopefully survive another day

862620,aplumma,2014-07-11 01:21:00,6896,You got catfish and you are playing with those stupid muskies? Yea I know fish with teeth have a certain allure... I am heading out Sat. for a snakehead tournament instead fo going for catfish.   Art.

X2  Hopefully getting the tape out a few times tomorrow, you need to get the dust off of it Mike.     It will be a great day regardless I'm sure."
