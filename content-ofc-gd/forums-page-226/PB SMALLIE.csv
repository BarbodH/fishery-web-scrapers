862884,misfish,2014-07-13 17:20:00,29133,"Thanks again guys.  The wind and rain kept me off the water today. I wanted so bad to get back out there. Found a sheltered bay,but the rain well,it was teaming down.  Old Ironmaker,I have had the chance to fish Erie. It was my very first Pro/Am. Drop shotting was the ticket for most,with the odd use of jerk baits. Great fishery.  I now have a new net and will get a scale for the next time.  Thanks for making my head swell more. LOL"

862785,Dan668,2014-07-12 20:24:00,1120,"Had a great year on Simcoe last year, have yet to make the trip this season. Amazing smallie fishery"
862799,Tim Mills,2014-07-12 23:08:00,476,Even more impressive landing it with no net in a float tube.  Nicely done.
862800,Christopheraaron,2014-07-12 23:14:00,3525,So when do I get to come up? LOL  Amazing fish Brian!
862810,Old Ironmaker,2014-07-13 01:59:00,8243,"That sir is one big sow. Being on Lake Erie and being spoiled with some of the craziest big smallies anywhere and I have seen some, actually many 6 pound fish, that is nowhere close to 6 sorry to say and I hate to break your bubble.  That fish is closer to 7 plus a few ounces. 7 minimum. She's a trophy fish in any lake, including Erie, in Ontario.  You were the Bassassin that day. I bow to you mi Lord."
862834,spincast,2014-07-13 12:50:00,3279,Nice going bud.    Gotta get me some of those soon
