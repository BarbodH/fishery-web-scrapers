862690,mattp33,2014-07-11 20:46:00,290,"Anyone wanna fish the tri-city CSFL tounement this weekend?  I want to fish it, got the boat but have no co-angler.  Split entry, boat splits winnings.  I dont worry too much about fuel in the boat I can cover that.  I am leaving from Orangeville and dont know the tri-lakes at all. Someone who knows a little about the lake will be preferable.  Entry is 300 and it leaves from Rotary park in bridgenorth at 7 am and finishes at 3  Disclaimer: This will be my first CSFL"
