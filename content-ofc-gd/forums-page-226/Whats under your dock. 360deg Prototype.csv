862914,misfish,2014-07-13 20:43:00,29133,"Just a start on something Im playing with. I want it for  360 deg,under water coverage from a boat and the tube.  This one is made from metal ( end cuts from work),but the finished product will be out of plastic.  It,s made of 1/2 inch galvanized conduit with machined aluminum inserts, that are attached together with 5/16th threaded rod. Over all length is 3 ft,but what I want is 4-5 ft.The lower camera mount is 3/8 lexan. The black foam is water pipe wrap, to act as a float. The metal is to heavy for this to work. (knew that already,,pool noodle will replace that with the finished product) I can turn this unit 360 deg using the top knob. I inserted an eye bolt there so I can attach a wrist lanyard,  Camera is attached and the camera lanyard is attached to the safety lanyard that is attached to the shaft..    Today was not the best day to try it out (rain clouded the water at the marina),but you will get what it will do.  Turn down your volume. I need to work on that issue.(anyone that knows how to cut the noise level,please help) Thanks       "
862916,glen,2014-07-13 20:46:00,2641,Cool.  Do you have vid out and a screen for on your float tube?
862918,misfish,2014-07-13 20:57:00,29133,Cool. Do you have vid out and a screen for on your float tube?  What ya talking about  Im a simple man here.LOL
862920,glen,2014-07-13 21:01:00,2641,Lol.  No your not.  You build all kinds of stuff.  How about a wireless remote control underwater camera that you can swim around.  A monitor for the dash of my boat too.
862923,misfish,2014-07-13 21:08:00,29133," How about a wireless remote control underwater camera that you can swim around.  That I have been thinking about. It wouldnt be hard to do,but then again,theres fish to catch."
862927,Terry,2014-07-13 21:27:00,14456,what program do you use  most have a noise volume  oh and looks cool
862937,Handlebarz,2014-07-13 22:31:00,3790,I use iMovie and there is a easy volume level control on it that I can adjust any part or all of the volume. Look around on your program it should have something along the same idea
862944,Rustic-Fisher,2014-07-13 23:21:00,826,"That's pretty cool, I can think of at least a dozen big dirty log jams that I'd love to have underwater footage of what's lurking beneath them."
862996,ecmilley,2014-07-14 10:02:00,2163,Have a rig like this on a friends ranger 12ft telescoping pole go pro camera feeds into the video input on the lowrance hds touch looks cool
