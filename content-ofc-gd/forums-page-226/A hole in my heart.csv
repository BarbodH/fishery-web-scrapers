862154,Beans,2014-07-08 16:16:00,3339,Sorry to hear this my friend...Good on you for trying to help
862272,Joey,2014-07-09 01:02:00,9122,"Been trying to figure out how to respond for awhile now Cliff.  All I can say is very sorry to hear this and I know all too well how you feel.  Addiction has affected many people in my life, friends and family included.  Take care bud and be strong."
862377,Big Cliff,2014-07-09 20:17:00,6899,"Thanks so much Joey, I don't think there are any ""right"" words but some how sharing and just knowing that other people do care does seem to make it easier!"
862382,dsn,2014-07-09 20:32:00,1018,Thats so sad to hear. Just when things were about to make a turn around.
862400,fishnsled,2014-07-09 21:19:00,3520,"Much like Joey, I have been lost for words Cliff.  Sorry for your loss but good on ya for being a friend to him."
862403,Big Cliff,2014-07-09 21:33:00,6899,Thats so sad to hear. Just when things were about to make a turn around. Love your signature!
862625,danc,2014-07-11 02:07:00,4677,"I've seen 2 family friends perish because of drugs in the past couple of years.  Sadly they are beyond help and before you know it, they are gone. In both cases I wish I could turn back time and help them when I could. But you just never know how deep they are into these things until it's to late. So sorry Cliff.."
862626,Pikeslayer,2014-07-11 02:18:00,1443,You were both privileged to know one another. So sorry for you both my friend.
861948,Big Cliff,2014-07-07 16:44:00,6899,"A very sad day and the tragic role that drugs play in the lives of so many of our youth.  None of you knew him, he was just 24; a really nice young man, he wasn’t afraid to work hard and enjoyed a cold beer on a hot day.  I only got to meet Jon this spring but took an instant liking to him, he’d occasionally come and help me work on things in the shop on the weekends or just hang out, he was always anxious to learn!  He had a lot of qualities and was the kind of kid any man would have been happy to have as a grandson. He didn’t have a job at the time so I always managed to find little projects for him so he’d have beer and cigarette money although he always reminded me that it wasn't necessary to pay him, he did it because he enjoyed it.  Jon had worked as a roofer and got involved in drugs but when I met him he had been clean for a little over 6 months.  He was living in Oshawa and didn’t have a car so the only time we got together is when his mom would pick him up and bring him up here to visit with her for the weekend.  His mom had been trying to find him a place here in Lindsay where he could get help and counseling but for some reason he didn’t qualify for any of the support facilities here. I am really not sure why, his mom was living up here and the environment in Oshawa wasn’t the best place for him to be with the struggle he faced.  About a month ago Jon got a job with a roofing company in the Oshawa area. To be honest we were all kind of worried about him going back into the environment where he had got into trouble before. The allure of good money was very tempting though, he wanted to save up a bit of money so he could start a business on his own next spring. We checked on him frequently and he seemed to be doing ok.  Saturday night I found out that Jon had died of an overdose. I am told that it is fairly common for someone that has been off the drugs for a while, apparently their body looses it’s tolerance to the drugs and a dose that they could tolerate before is too much for them to handle now.  I am really going to miss Jon, he was starting to get interested in fishing and I had fixed him up with a rod and some tackle so he could have his own stuff. We were talking about different businesses he could start and had discussed putting a business plan together.  RIP Jon you will be very much missed!"
861950,Cast-Away,2014-07-07 16:48:00,790,Very sad when you hear stories like this Cliff. Too bad you never got to help out Jon.
861952,Spanky80,2014-07-07 16:53:00,152,"I'm sorry for your loss Big Cliff, very sad story.  Drug addiction is a horrible disease, I am saddened and disappointed that Jon didn't qualify for the support he needed.  My fiancee has been and continues down this road with a family member...if there is anything to take from this is your support and friendship with Jon."
861958,lew,2014-07-07 17:21:00,12766,"Sorry about your friend Cliff, I've also lost a couple friends the same way  and it's very sad to see someone die like that. Always seems to be such a waste of a life."
861962,quickme,2014-07-07 17:58:00,261,sorry to hear about your loss.  It seemed that he was a solid kid.   You're a great man to take him under your wing.
861963,Oggie,2014-07-07 18:14:00,588,"Unfortunately this sad story seems more and more common.  I thought the 60's where the generation of sex, drugs and rock/roll but today's world seems to have a bigger problem. More addictive alternatives I guess.  Sorry for the loss Cliff. Dan O."
861968,Rodbender,2014-07-07 18:57:00,1027,First off Cliff sorry on your loss Second Thank you for trying to help him out so many just write them off  Now I'll tell my tale of the addiction I had with drugs.  I was young when I started 16 and on cocaine I don't blame anyone except myself for these reasons.  1 Parents never divorced and I was my mother golden child 2 Wasn't the one at high school that got weggied and thrown into lockers 3 wasn't an outcast  My main reason was too much money too young I started as an apprentise electrician at 16 licienced a 21.  It started at a PARTY yep I'm 16 at a field party guess what couple older girls liked me and introduced me to COCAINE after taking it I was wide awake(something inside me said wow you can work side jobs and you daily job)  Fastforward to 24 years old  I lost everything House Snowmobiles Truck Boat you name it it was gone to repo man  The last weekend I did Coke I snorted 15 grand worth and had gas bills for the truck from Buffalo Detroit and North Bay  I went to my parents place and my dad sat me down and laid out the rules for me (I Know if I left there that night and I think he did I wouldn't be here today)  I lost a lot of years with my parents back then and still trying to make it up to them I know they have forgave me but in my heart I can never make that time up again.

861975,davey buoy,2014-07-07 19:15:00,5505,"Very sad Cliff,you did as well as you could as a friend.The drugs available today are not the same as years past. Maybe help should be more available,having said that you must want to go as well.Happens far to often."

861984,crappieperchhunter,2014-07-07 19:56:00,2582,Sorry to hear this kind of news Cliff. Way too young to be leaving this world for any reason.
862012,outllaw,2014-07-07 22:25:00,1232,sorry cliff. these stories rip yer heart out. sadly there becoming common here in Canada.
862021,SirCranksalot,2014-07-07 22:40:00,3291,Too common and so very tragic.
862022,Rodbender,2014-07-07 22:56:00,1027,Thank you Cliff I tell my story where I can to maybe help someone out I was destined to die and was on the verge
862023,Pigeontroller,2014-07-07 23:00:00,2793,"Very sad, tragic and all too common..."
862024,Steve,2014-07-07 23:00:00,2075,"i'll admit, although I've never got mixed up with drugs, many of my friends who have did so because they simply made too much money for their maturity level.  unfortunately the vast majority of these folks (over 10 of them) work in power plants in this province. people in their 20's need to be careful when they're making 100K+ a year.  good on ya Cliff to have a heart! I'm sorry it ended the way it did."
862025,mattyk,2014-07-07 23:04:00,2110,I'm sorry about your loss. My condolences.
862035,ketchenany,2014-07-08 00:01:00,3229,"Cliff you are wise man to try help him out. Today these things are common. But it's something that they tend to bring on themselves. And while they think it's a great thing but don't think of what will happen later in life.We all  did things we want to forget but that kind of stuff tends to come with you. In our family we have never had the occasion, my four girls have a glass of wine (and it better be good) they don't smoke, happily married with children. But then we set the rules early and they followed them to T. Your post will probably help members that may want to venture that way and may think twice before they start. Althought it's a bad situation some good will come out by helping someone else."
862041,Musky or Specks,2014-07-08 00:14:00,2710,Cliff thank you for trying to be an influence in that young man's life. Sorry it turned out this way. Addiction is a byiatch.
862060,bigbuck,2014-07-08 00:56:00,2449,"Cliff, you did what you could for him. I'm sorry for your loss."
862065,kitch,2014-07-08 01:15:00,42,I'm sorry at the outcome but admire what you did for him while he was around you.
862072,wvmedic,2014-07-08 01:37:00,144,"Cliff, good on you for being a mentor to the young man.  It is a very sad and tragic ordeal, and is happening to often. At least here in my area, I run several overdose call a month. We just checked our statistics and there isn't a 24hr period in our county that one of our ambulances isn't dispatched on the minimum of one overdose, more times than not it is four or five.  Jeff"
862078,ccmtcanada,2014-07-08 01:55:00,7971,That's terrible news.  You have a big heart and I know yours is hurting right now.  My condolences Cliff.
862102,Old Ironmaker,2014-07-08 07:59:00,8243,"I'm sorry for you loss Sir. At our age it seems, no actually it is, that one can attend a service every week or so. But when we bury a kid that never got to have a life is tragic. A very close friend lost his 23 year old son to the same thing 2 years ago. He's lost. There is nothing we can say or do to help him. After 32 years his wife and he split. I'm so sorry Cliff."
862116,doubleheader,2014-07-08 12:26:00,497,"So much I'd like to say, but all I will say is I'm very sorry for your loss Cliff."
862145,Big Cliff,2014-07-08 15:37:00,6899,"Thanks everyone, just sitting down and typing it all out helped but your thoughts and stories help too! I guess I will always wish I could have done more but that just wasn't meant to be.  I know it probably sounds silly for me to get so attached to someone I hadn't known for very long but that's just me LOL.  Thanks again everyone for understanding!"
