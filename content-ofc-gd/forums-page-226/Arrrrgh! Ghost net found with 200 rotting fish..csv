I truly share the anger that is being portrayed in local coffee shops, in newspaper comment sections and in social media. These reckless and illegal acts are unforgiveable. My heart aches as I feel the pain of our beautiful lake and the fish-life that have given our people sustenance and life for centuries. Instead of sulking and festering, I have decided to put forward my thoughts on a decisive action plan that might contribute to the resolution of this issue. I am pleased to deliver this for consideration to my community. 1. Investigation and Prosecution Illegal fishing, accidentally losing a net, recklessness, carelessness, or not using NFN registered gill net tags – no matter how you phrase it, it’s an offence. It may or may not be a criminal offence, a provincial conservation offence or even an NFN by-law offence – but it IS an offence against natural law and the values and practices of our people. ACTION: I hereby demand that Nipissing First Nation enable our own authorities and call in the assistance of the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources to investigate and prosecute the perpetrators of these immoral offences to the furthest extent of the law. If these are Nipissing First Nation members, other First Nation members, or anyone that may be wrongfully hiding behind the veil of Aboriginal and Treaty Rights, your time is up. 2. Courageous and Decisive Leadership It is time for leadership on this issue. Not only for Nipissing First Nation Chief and Council but for each and every one of us. What can you do to be part of the solution? ACTION: I am personally offering a $1000.00 reward for any information provided to Nipissing First Nation or the Ministry of Natural Resources that leads to the successful prosecution of those who have been fishing illegally and are responsible for the abandoned nets. We need leadership and action now to protect our rights as Anishinaabe people. 3. More Effective Regulation, Enforcement The right to an indigenous commercial fishery is a collective right, not an individual right. Our Aboriginal and Treaty Rights must be protected for the benefit of all Nbisiing citizens, our families and for all Anishinaabe people. We must also do our part, as traditional stewards of our territorial lands and waters, to protect the resource from illegal fishing and overfishing. Nipissing First Nation has the right to regulate this fishery. But so far, NFN regulations have done little to curb illegal fishing and abandoned nets. ACTION: I am calling for stronger laws, regulations, increased enforcement and strong punishments for those harvesting outside of the law. This includes lifetime bans, substantial fines and even imprisonment for those guilty of abandoning a gill net. It’s also time that our First Nation laws be enforced by provincial Conservation Officers and Ontario Courts. Nipissing First Nation must finally find a way to work alongside the Ministry of Natural Resources, to jointly work for the good of the lake and the fish-life. 4. Improved Tools & Training for Commercial Harvesters Our Aboriginal and Treaty Rights can be enhanced by using modern technology to monitor and improve practices in gill netting. Gill nets need to be better marked will buoys equipped with highly visual markers and perhaps even GPS equipment for guaranteed location. Registered commercial harvesters should be trained in interpreting the weather, wind and the current patterns of the lake to aid in safety and predicting the drift of their nets. ACTION: I recommend that Nipissing First Nation develop a pilot project to study possible options to enhance the visibility of markers, the electronic tracking of gill nets and improved training of our commercial harvesters. 5. Taking Steps to Move Away from the Fishery For decades, our people made a moderate living off the Lake. My family, and most other families at one time or another were commercial harvesters. We sold our fish out of our backdoor or even out of the back of our trunk. Today, given the state of the Lake and the health of the fishery, our people need to move away from the fishery as a means of earning a living. Our community should be setting our own quota, providing a finite number of commercial gill-netting licenses, and slowly reducing these over time. Or perhaps increasing these over time, depending on the health of the fishery. But to allow for such bold action, our community needs to find sound alternatives for those harvesters who legitimately depend on the fishery as their source of income. ACTION: I recommend that Nipissing First Nation develop a community employment and training strategy that will lead to more skills and jobs for those solely reliant on the fishery. I further recommend that the Province of Ontario invest in such an initiative with a focus on encouraging training, occupations and professions that give back to the Lake and the fishery, rather than deplete the resource. 6. Treaty Education Last, but not least, it is clear by a lot of the newspaper comments section and social media, that there is a very outspoken and vibrant community of ignorance out there. People who are ignorant of the facts about Aboriginal and Treaty Rights. Most are angry individuals who harbor personal resentments that leads to inaccurate, uninformed, hurtful and harmful statements. Racist statements against First Nations people seem to be the norm, and seem to be acceptable, when news like this is published. Ladies and Gentlemen, kind reader – Aboriginal and Treaty Rights are a reality and they are fact. The case law at all levels, including the Supreme Court of Canada, has repeatedly affirmed and entrenched these rights. Nipissing First Nation has the right to a commercial fishery. Nipissing First Nation members have the right to use gill nets. Nipissing First Nation has a right to regulate our own fishery. These aren’t opinions, they are not unfounded statements, these are facts. The tide needs to turn. Just like the 1960s, many people have had to come to grips with civil rights. For some, it was a tough time. To understand civil rights and appreciate civil rights. So too does the Indigenous rights movement. We can’t be content with just saying “it is what it is”. We need the average Canadian to understand why “it is what it is”. ACTION: All levels of government, including Nipissing First Nation, need to do more to educate non-native people about our rights. I strongly encourage the Government of Canada, the Government of Ontario and even our First Nation to invest in Treaty Education. It is through leadership and decisive action, we can eliminate illegal fishing and rebuild the strength of our fishery through understanding, partnership and mutual respect. Moreover, it should be goal of everyone involved, to that we never see another illegal, abandoned gill net in Lake Nipissing. - http://www.nugget.ca/2014/07/11/mnr-needs-help-"

860402,Nipfisher,2014-06-26 03:21:00,2449,"Fourth net found!    The situation isn't getting any better.   The Ministry of Natural Resources confirmed a fourth net was pulled from Lake Nipissing between Manitou Islands and the government dock on Monday.  Jolanta Kowalski, senior media relations officer with the MNR, said the ministry is continuing with its investigation.  She wouldn't confirm how the net was found, however The Nugget was told by a witness that the net was caught on the keel of a sailboat.  Kowalski said three of the four nets that have been found are anchored and are still actively fishing.  The issue with these nets, from a conservation perspective is that they are not being attended to in appropriate time, so the fish are being allowed to spoil.  Kowalski said only one of the four nets discovered was freely floating in Lake Nipissing.  She said the nets are not tagged and there is no identification on the nets.  Registered nets with Nipissing First Nation fishermen are equipped with either a numbered white or yellow tag. Fishermen who net are required to report and fill out catch forms.  Three of the four nets were located over the last two weeks in the area between the Manitou Island and the government dock. The third net was found in a different area on Lake Nipissing. The pulled nets were discovered full of dead fish.  The first net was discovered on June 7 and area fishermen estimate there were 200 rotting fish caught in it.  Kowalski said the discovered nets are not causing safety concerns.  Calls to Nipissing First Nation were not immediately returned by press time.  Nipissing First Nation Chief Marianna Couchie stated in a previous interview that she and council are concerned with the number of unmarked ghost nets in Lake Nipissing.  She said unmarked nets contravene the Nipissing Fisheries Law and undermine the lawful exercise of Aboriginal and Treaty rights by our harvesters.  Couchie said Nipissing First Nation understands the pressure the lake is under and are working with their fishermen to address these issues. "

Fishermen who net are required to report and fill out catch forms.Couchie said companies or individuals who sell fishing nets don't ask whether the person purchasing them are First Nations.She said anyone can purchase a net and put them in the lake.“We're so frustrated by these abandoned nets. We've never experienced so many.”The fifth net found was discovered in Lake Nipissing Saturday morning by a boater on the way to his cottage.Joe Simpson was crossing the south shore of Lake Nipissing in Meadow Bay near Cross Point, Saturday at about 10 a.m. when he saw a large group of seagulls hovering above the lake.He drove his boat up to the gulls to see what was attracting them.“I saw this net full of dead fish,” Simpson said Wednesday. “There were some big pickerel in there. It was very upsetting.”Simpson said he contacted the Ministry of Natural Resources and the Ontario Provincial Police to report the net.“There were no markings or tags on the net to identify who it belonged to, but it was anchored.”He said he went back to the spot where he found the net Sunday at 10 a.m. and it was still there.“It was huge, about 150 to 200 feet. It was so big I had to drive my boat around it.”Simpson said his neighbour wasn't so lucky.He said his neighbour hit the net. The collision jerked his boat forward.Jolanta Kowalski, senior media relations officer with the MNR, confirmed that MNR fishery staff pulled a fifth net from Lake Nipissing.She said the MNR is continuing its investigation, however no further details were released.The last net was located on June 23 between Manitou Islands and the government dock.Kowalski said three of the four nets that have been found were anchored and were still actively fishing.

862516,crosshairs,2014-07-10 14:08:00,55,"I just want to say the NFN community is outraged, yet the elected officials refuse to listen. Community members go to council meetings to discuss this and they are basically ignored, phones and laptops all being used during the presentations, 2 commercial fisherman councilors still allowed to make decisions to benefit themselves and the community has no recourse except vote differently next election. It is truly a sad state of affairs. To the point where one elderly woman who has voiced her concerns and is a staff at NFN has been harassed and bullied by one of these councilors mentioned above, and the administration said they have little recourse for dealing with councilors. It is starting to get ugly around here. A community member presented council with a petition to stop commercial fishing, not sure how many names he had but he said all they told him was thanks and went to the next agenda item.  Can someone just call lekies net and twine in Winnipeg and see if you can order some gill nets (nugget should do this). I believe you need a status card, an assessment, or commercial licence so that is just Bull. Yesterday it was announced a 5th has been collected, just for clarification all these nets combined are more than likely close to 50 gill nets. Each ""set"" typically has 10 panels. Panels are 300 feet long and can range in depth from 3 feet to 30 feet. So in total there was very likely 15000 feet (4.575 km) of net recovered. Each panel costs around $150.  As for the tagging of the nets none of the non registered use tags, and as far as I know they out number the registered fisherman. I said it before but the best thing that could happen is a collapse, and over time it will recover but this would pretty well ensure a commercial fishery will not exist in our lifetime.  I just hope that no one gets hurt during all this, and Chief and Council are held accountable for their actions and inaction. I did not know sticking your head in the sand was a management system!!

Jolanta Kowalski, senior media relations officer with the Ministry of Natural Resources, told The Nugget MNR staff are aware of the net and it is being investigated.  She said this isn't the first time the public has discovered a net floating in Lake Nipissing.  “MNR staff have located and pulled drifting nets in the past,” Kowalski said Monday.  “If an untagged or unmarked net is discovered, the public is asked not to remove, or otherwise tamper with it, but rather to note the location of the net and report it to the ministry using the toll-free MNR TIPS Reporting Line.”  News spread quickly of the discovery through various social media platforms.  A picture was taken of the large net near the lake's surface with white bloating fish entangled in it. The picture had been shared more than 200 times through Facebook.  Clint Couchie, manager of natural resources for Nipissing First Nation, said he is aware of the discovery.  He said registered nets with Nipissing First Nation fishermen are equipped with either a numbered white or yellow tag. Fishermen who net are required to report and fill out catch forms.  “Fishermen lose their nets sometimes, but we don't just leave them floating in the lake. We help them find them,” Couchie said Monday.  He said the public is being asked not to touch the nets and definitely don't try pulling them up. Instead the ghost nets should be reported to the Ministry of Natural Resources.  “When Nipissing First Nation nets are properly anchored to the bottom you will see a dead-head jog on top of the water.”  Couchie said not all nets belong to Nipissing First Nation fishermen.  To report a natural resources violation, call 1-877-TIPS-MNR (847-7667) toll-free any time, or contact your local ministry office during regular business hours. You can also call Crime Stoppers anonymously at 1-800-222-TIPS (8477). "

857578,Joey,2014-06-10 23:07:00,9122,What a waste to an already suffering fishery
857614,Nipfisher,2014-06-11 03:18:00,2449,An unnecessary risk to take. There are lots of reports of those nets sinking to the bottom and collecting fish for years.
857629,fishindevil,2014-06-11 07:23:00,6254,Yes I seen this a few days ago in the media.!!! And if course nobody is going to claim it and  nobody knows nothing about it !!!! Must have been the recreational fishermen who did this !!!  After all it's because if the recreational fishermen that there are ghost nets found quite often !!!
857641,outllaw,2014-06-11 11:19:00,1232,"yepir seen lots of ghost nets from l.erie,,,l.st clair. mnr will pull them if found. if you find 1 get gps numbers or its near impossible to find them searching."
857643,Gallie,2014-06-11 11:32:00,1215,"Thats hard to look at but far from surprising, dont worry im sure they will get a new net out there asap."
857701,Headhunter,2014-06-11 18:32:00,5703,Thanks for posting this... kinda backs up some of the info we had in an earlier Nipissing thread. HH

858004,moxie,2014-06-13 00:57:00,1566,High time to call it the way it is or better yet pull all native funding till we draft a fair agreement so we can let the curtain fall on this centuries old ballet once and for all. Whats the worst that could happen?
858051,Rod Caster,2014-06-13 03:12:00,5784,"The nugget convieniently forgot to open the comments on this article, sometimes I think the Nugget has a relationship with NFN.  It's not the first time they haven't allowed comments on a story about the comercial fishery. ya, they never open up comments to these types of artcles, as much as there are brutal posters on that site, it would nice to open it up to some discussion...with fair moderation.  i'm disgusted by that photo. Most likely it was left there due to equipment breakdown (boat), bad weather or plain ignorance."
858056,blarg,2014-06-13 03:50:00,289,you wanna read all the ignorant quotes etc read the sun forums lol A clearly unbiased opinion.
858091,Headhunter,2014-06-13 12:54:00,5703,"As most of us know, Lake Nip is a very complicated situation. At this point, there is no way of telling who owned the net or why it was left out in the lake. Assumptions are far easier then facts. It has been mentioned here, to anyone with an open enough mind, willing to listen, that NFN are NOT the only ones netting the lake. Illegal harvest has been going on for years and will likely continue to, until enforcement becomes more than just lip service. I have seen a willingness among some to discuss this situation openly and with the best interest of the lake in mind. I would hate see frustration with this situation and the others that are to follow, result in more name calling. I'm pretty sure folks on both sides of this are disgusted by what they are seeing. HH"
858097,Roy,2014-06-13 13:18:00,13728,"Time for another insightful post from Crosshairs,"
858098,Rod Caster,2014-06-13 13:18:00,5784,"Its safe to say it's not a commercial net. Those are monitored quite closely, tagged, accounted for when missing etc.  I've heard of a few instances were guys set nets, get caught in dangerous situations (like weather, too heavy of nets) and they end up leaving them. Basically it's a miscalculation (or ignorance) on their part. Still lots of people netting the lake under their 'personal' rights and they are not all experienced and well-calculated. Also, sometimes, poop happens that you can't control."
858116,Headhunter,2014-06-13 14:49:00,5703,Agree 100% Roy! HH
858152,crosshairs,2014-06-13 18:45:00,55,"Like head hunter said, there are so many variables that could play into this situation. I just want to say that this is very upsetting but a sad reality which comes along with commercial fishing. Comments like ""cutting the natives funding until agreements are reached"" don't help. NFN has a membership of roughly 2400 members and have approximately 25 full and part time fisherman. Of these 25 there are 5-6 that are fishing just to supply their habits. So their priorities are alittle skewed to say the least, they are struggling with addictions that are slowly killing them.  The actions of this small group do not speak to the views and ideals of this community, so punishing or blaming all natives really bothers me. This small group don't have children going to school and hearing their friends tell them about the Indians cleaning out the lake, or blaming them individually. I am glad the nugget doesn't allow comments, the blatant racism in north bay is disgusting and quite sad. It is a commercial fishery, regardless of the race.  Back to the issue, the nets found were well anchored had no float markers and did not have nfn tags. There was 8 in total and 80% of the fish were coarse fish according to the OMNR. Here are some possibilities  1) nfn commercial not marking due to net tampering and not having GPS to locate, and inexperienced at using land markers for location 2) non native (like gentleman who drowned last year lifting nets) 3) other groups asserting their jurisdiction 4) any first nation in the robinson huron treaty area 5) inter treaty harvesting permission  My personal opinion, it was one of the commercial (bad guys) who probably misjudged the exact location of their nets. I am not sure what effect prescription drugs has on a person mentally but I can tell you these guys look like hell, it is sad really. This isn't the first time this has been an issue, it happens a lot with high winds and people like Rod Caster mentions. These fish are accounted for in the commercial harvest.  The fishery is in dire straits yet chief and council refuse to accept that the commercial fishery is part of the problem. Not sure if it is because 2 councilors are commercial fisherman lol. as I stated in previous posts anglers are out in left field, NFN basically has the means to either save this fishery or see it through to it's demise. It is quite simple , the combination of both fisheries attacking the walleye prior to age 5 ( spawning age) hasn't allowed any through (3% of population age 5 and up) if the commercial continues these last few age classes will not make it to age 5. I'm not a bio but alittle common sense will tell the outcome.  Some of the community has made a demand that chief and council host a summit for the NFN community and they want to see all the data, until now No data has gone to the community from the band. They get their info from the nugget and I believe they see what is really happening. Hopefully something will come of that.  Again please don't paint all First nations people with the same brush and be aware of who is around when these feelings are being discussed, there is no need for any kids regardless of race to feel those kind of feelings.  Take Care my friends."
858154,Roy,2014-06-13 19:17:00,13728,Thank you for your valued opinion. Some excellent points there.

858158,crosshairs,2014-06-13 19:51:00,55,"All the OMNR have to do is prove the commercial fishery is a conservation threat and the courts will rule in their favor. With the new regs for anglers just occurring perhaps they are waiting and gathering information and data for a year to ensure they have a solid case. wouldn't want to lose this one.  This is the only way I can possibly see anything happening for the long term health of the lake, the courts would ensure an accountable management regime be in place before allowing more commercial fishing to occur if the lake even recovers. Everyone should contact their MP's, MPP's and who ever else to demand the data for lake nipissing be reviewed because it shows there is a conservation threat to the walleye. Pike and whitefish populations are also down from what I understand, these are all targeted species for the commercial fishery. I am trying my best at this end, maybe if there was pressure from else where things might happen. Just thinking out loud.  Anyways the lake nipissing summit is being held June 24th in sturgeon falls at the river house museum from 9 -4. Register at lakenipissingsummit.ca. Perhaps the chief and the 2 commercial fisherman councilors might want to hear what the general public has to say. Their thoughts are clear, just visit NFN.ca and look at council minutes some of their views are stated there.  Happy fathers day all and enjoy this beautiful weekend."
858169,aplumma,2014-06-13 20:41:00,6896,"I hope all of the people that have an opinion go to the meetings and then can be assured of the facts to reach their conclusions. As always thank you Crosshairs for taking the time to post here and show the rest of the story. . They are both insightful and are not defensive of the First Nation being above the law but rather doing your best to keep the treaties enforced and adjusted in the changing times of Lake Nipissing. I travel 13 hours yearly to fish this one body of water because of the fish, the people and the scenery that it provides for me to enjoy.   Art"
