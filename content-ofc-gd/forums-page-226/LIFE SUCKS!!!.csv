860734,Twocoda,2014-06-29 04:30:00,4130,The alternatives aren't too favourable so try to make the best of it ..
860746,okumasheffield,2014-06-29 12:12:00,318,I don't get it
860779,Big Cliff,2014-06-29 16:35:00,6899,"Suck it up buttercup, it only gets worse from here"
860788,Musky or Specks,2014-06-29 17:27:00,2710,You better be getting your camp ready and just for rubbing it in I hope the bugs are awful
860835,DRIFTER_016,2014-06-29 22:33:00,10439,No bugs here.
860852,DRIFTER_016,2014-06-30 02:07:00,10439,Got the ramp relocated to a better spot and installed the decking this weekend. Seems it gets the seal of approval from Sahtu the wonder dog.    Also finished the sub structure for the main dock and it is ready to flip over and get launched with a little help from friends on Canada Day. Will get it launched and installed along with a ton of granite boulders that will be used for anchoring the dock. Decking will get done next weekend if weather permits (not looking good right now though).  
860889,Sinker,2014-06-30 13:17:00,8692,Lookin good Dave!  S.
861248,DRIFTER_016,2014-07-02 02:15:00,10439,Made it back out to the property today with a buddy to help me get the main dock installed and my granite anchor boulders placed in the lake.  A few pics of the progress.          
861257,mcdougy,2014-07-02 02:59:00,274,"Looks good, how far you spanning that 5/4 decking? Don't want any injuries as it sounds like there is a bunch of work coming up."

861294,DRIFTER_016,2014-07-02 14:55:00,10439,"Decking will be spanning a maximum of 21"" (still have blocking to put in down the middle of the main dock).  Mike the drilling was pretty easy. I rented one of these: https://www.hilti.ca/drilling-%26-demolition/combihammers/r4699 Along with the proper sized bits for the job. 5/8"" holes took less than a minute to drill (about 3"" deep) and the larger ones for the eyebolts took about  1 1/2 minutes and were about 4"" deep."

861354,Big Cliff,2014-07-02 22:50:00,6899,"Oh the pain and the joy LOL! I have so many wonderful memories of projects like that! Lots of hard work, sore muscles, and always a few bruses but the rewards are worth every bit of it.  Thanks for posting those pictures, it is fun to watch your progress!"
862811,DRIFTER_016,2014-07-13 02:12:00,10439,Thanks Cliff. Got out today and got the deck installed on the main dock so now I have a working dock. The winds have been pretty bad the last couple of weeks and the dock came through in great shape. My guess is there must have been 3+ footers as the water came far enough up the rock to lift and move three of the four 5/4 deck boards I left at the head of the ramp.    Here are a few shots of the mostly finished dock. Still have some dock edging to put on and a couple of tie off rings.              
862830,Musky or Specks,2014-07-13 12:40:00,2710,Man that veiw is so beautiful. You are a lucky man.
862872,davey buoy,2014-07-13 16:04:00,5505,Sure looking good Dave!   .
