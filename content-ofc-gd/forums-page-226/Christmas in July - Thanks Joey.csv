Well Joey had these cool prints of fish on rice paper she made (can't recall the style name?), but I saw one that caught my eye and asked her to hold it for me till I could pay. She gladly agreed. I can't recall exactly when I received it but it was shortly after Christmas.  Well I finally had it framed and I'm very happy. What can't be seen in the picture very well is the gold metallic in the fish which is subtly picked up with some gold in the frame I chose. It's a tweed type matting which looks great with the rice paper. I only wish they could have matted it with fewer flaws but they said that was the nature of rice paper. Overall size is 20"" x  23""  Anyway I've yet to hang it but here it is.  "
