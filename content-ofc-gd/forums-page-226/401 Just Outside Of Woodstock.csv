I may have been there as a kid I may have not been, it's been that long.  Is anyone familiar with that water?  Something tells me there is nothing or if it is fish able it is a treasure chest filled with bass and maybe pike.  Directions to it would be appreciated also,"
863025,adempsey,2014-07-14 18:17:00,1498,I think it might be Park Haven Lake?    That's the only water you can see from the 401 in that area as far as I recall.   I've seen people boating on it recently.   Don't know much about it though.
863028,Roy,2014-07-14 18:29:00,13728,Lots of info on park haven lake via Google.
863029,Musky or Specks,2014-07-14 18:30:00,2710,Park Haven has Largemouth and Pike that I have caught but haven't been in a while.
863030,HyperActive,2014-07-14 18:31:00,56,"You are correct and that is the water that catches everyone's, but when coming back from Guelph on Saturday I seen a body of water across the 401 from the park. I know of one or two other well hidden holes in that area. I have a strong hunch about this one, but would love to know if anyone else has ventured back there.  With the price of gas......may not need to finish,"
863032,Musky or Specks,2014-07-14 18:42:00,2710,Yes there is a lake/pon a little further west on the opposite side of the 401 from Park Haven. I see a dock in there but have never accessed it and I don't think there  is public access.  Looks like its called Fowlers Pond.  
863033,Steve,2014-07-14 18:47:00,2075,the spot **I believe** you are referring to does not have public access.
863035,HyperActive,2014-07-14 19:25:00,56,"Never ceases to amaze me.  Thank you folks,"
863159,skidoosafari,2014-07-15 02:28:00,46,"The pond on the south east side is known as lockheart. Fished there many times.  I have a trailer @ park haven, it is a private lake with no public access ."
