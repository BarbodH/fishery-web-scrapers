862854,muskymatt,2014-07-13 14:50:00,2608,After answering a request for some info on the Ottawa river I offered to rendezvous with Ainsley (Chris) and his buddy. So I launched at Dick Bell marina and made my way up river to a property just up river from Pinheys point and picked up my 2 boat mates for the morning. With no real plans I figured we would just try for whatever was out there so we hit some bays and structure and started casting.  This biggie was actually caught on a top raider while casting for Muskies.   A few small pike were caught   And a decent one   Lots of fun! Thanks for coming out guys!

862940,Ainsley,2014-07-13 23:09:00,142,That was an awesome morning on the water Matt! Thanks again. I still can't believe that largie weighed in at only 5lbs.
