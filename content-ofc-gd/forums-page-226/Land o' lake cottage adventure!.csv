862818,SHAD,2014-07-13 04:08:00,134,Spent last week at a cottage rental near Perth in the land o' lakes region.  We had never fished this lake before and took a few days to figure out areas and a pattern due to a cold front that came in early one.  Senkos and spinnerbaits early am for bass and mid sized cranks in the afternoon and evening were the trick!  Here are some pics from our vacation:  http://smg.photobucket.com/user/soderstar/slideshow/Story%20lake

862821,Rich Clemens,2014-07-13 10:00:00,3131,"We fished the Rideau out of Rideau Ferry, not far from Perth for quite a few years. We would run into Perth quite often just to look around.  Quite the nice historic town.  The old rubber worm bouncing through the weeds, we picked a lot of nice bass. Even bouncing across the rocky shoals was great for smallies.   We lived top water action early in the am - and again just before dusk.  Looking forward to seeing your pics."
