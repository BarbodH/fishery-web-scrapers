862480,Old Ironmaker,2014-07-10 02:58:00,8243,"My 2 cents is that if someone is doing a fly-in it's usually an opportunity for a personal best or a trophy fish, something us mere mortals don't do regularly (insert M. Borger here). That's not the time for me to start experimenting with something I'm not accustomed to. Wire leaders sure did the job when we ventured 17 hours north of Hamilton years ago before colour TV's were on the market, OK PC's. One personal best Pike after the last when they are on the bite. Talk about lure action we used whole frozen smelts and Herring.  Being exclusively on crystal clear Erie now nothing while longlining is used without a invisible length of flouro on it, at least 25 feet. A 10 pound Walleye has long sharp pearlies that will rival any Northern. Also flouro on any other type of line for Smallies. I don't usually use any leader specific fluorocarbon like Seagar, but have if available from someone else's bag. I just tie on about 18"" of flouro and cut it back if niks or kinks develop. The first time bit off was only a few weeks back while tossing a topwater for smallies when a very large Gar took it.  I want as little terminal tackle on anything. Even downrigging etc. I want to take the time to tie directly to a plug. Spoons to a barrel swivel, no snaps. I don't want to pull a bait up and find I've been pulling the thing hooked onto the gap in the snap for 20 minutes.  I guess that 3 cents not 2.  I must add the flourocarbon of choice is the one on sale. 25 pound for trolling 10 pound for smallies."
862486,BillM,2014-07-10 04:06:00,17367,It doesn't take a big pike to slash through braid....   20lb flouro or even mono is cheap insurance for that $15 jerkbait.
862488,Old Ironmaker,2014-07-10 04:57:00,8243,You are right Bill. I might not be able to bite through braid but the rocks out here fray the good braid and don't really effect the fluorocarbon much. I wasn't into the super lines until well after they came out but am sure glad I did. It wasn't unusual to go through 3 or more spools of Trilene and Zero (still my favorite mono) a season on each spool. I've yet to have a fish bite off leadcore.
862540,AKRISONER,2014-07-10 15:49:00,5558,"call me crazy, but i always fish with wire leaders for pike, to me they usually ambush the meps, spoon etc anyways and dont seem very concerned with the line I am using. I also like the ability to swap lures in seconds flat when a pike comes in and misses the first hit, A quick swap to a different colour or pattern gets me back on the water and able to go after the pike before its gone.  I will also mention that ive been fishing with braid for walley for the past 5 years since i got a place in pointe au baril, and i honestly dont feel like the line I am using has been the deal breaker.  I might have to look into the idea of 100lbs mono leaders though for the spring pike and musky run."

When a pike comes in and misses the 1st hit it usually means he wants it, so you should be tossing it right back at him and giving him what he wants rather than switching colors.  He liked what he saw the 1st time, so chances are he'll hit it again, specially if he was aggressive 1st time around."
862582,AKRISONER,2014-07-10 21:11:00,5558,"I mis spoke, usually I will switch after the pike goes quiet. If a pike misses, I usually throw it right back at him, but if I get no action the second pass I switch fast."
862036,sneak_e_pete,2014-07-08 00:02:00,540,"Hey all, heading on a fly-in in 2 weeks.  What are your thoughts on steel leaders?  Necessary for the pike?"
862039,Christopheraaron,2014-07-08 00:06:00,3525,"I much prefer heavy mono or fluro for pike, but I would pack leaders as well just incase you find they're chewing through them."

862050,kickingfrog,2014-07-08 00:26:00,8333,Heavy flouro works but i've also used TUF-line TUF leader. It's a wire line that you can tie yourself using conventional knots. It worked well.

862061,Joeytier,2014-07-08 00:56:00,3990,I do use steel leaders but they will definitely kink up and compromise the strength of the steel and and the lure action if the fish twist them up.  Just check them after every fish and you will be fine
862073,ccmtcanada,2014-07-08 01:42:00,7971,For toothy critters I will use titanium leaders.  They are thinner than steel and don't crimp after fighting a fish.
862075,BillM,2014-07-08 01:43:00,17367,"Flouro, 80-100lb"
862123,msp,2014-07-08 13:07:00,1336,I have been experimenting with heavy flouro leaders and steel titanium leader quite a bit in the last few years. Pros and cons to both. 100 # flouro learders have been bitten clean through by big pike. not very often but it has happened. A couple of true trophy fish lost ( not to mention the lure ) The action of the bait was not compromised with 100 # flouro. Back to back uni knot works well. I usually tie on an 18inch leader and inspect and shorten often when I start to see knicks.  Started using tieable titanium leader from a few different companies with mixed reviews. 20# Terminator and 20 # Knot to Kinky seem to work well. A little tough to tie knots but once you get it right it seems to work well. Back to back uni from leader to main line and a loop ( rapala ) knot to the clip. This leader WILL kink once a couple of fish wrap around the line. This does effect the action of the lure. The weight of the leader also makes the bait sink a little bit pointing the nose down.  I would suggest bringing both types of leader material and experiment to see which you prefer. or use both
862156,Gallie,2014-07-08 16:29:00,1215,"80- 130lb flouro leaders, i have been using the 100 lb most often. Highdrifter tied me some real nice ones that i caught a couple 40""+ pike on. I have not been bit off on a flouro leader but it now concerns me to hear someone else has. If im trolling i like to use the heavier 130 lb. i dont use wire at all anymore"
862161,fish_fishburn,2014-07-08 17:20:00,1311,"Wire leaders are cheap and when they kink I just replace them. Lost some big Northerns on fluoro. I use the black leaders, not sure if that matters at all. Cant remember ever seeing a line shy Northern."
862164,Roy,2014-07-08 17:58:00,13728,"It's been  nearly 15 years since I've used wire leaders. I've never been bitten off by any esox and te bonus is that if the fish rolls or is the least bit acrobatic, he won't be cutting himself up on the wire. I also use 80 to 130lbs for both casting and trolling."
862165,JoshS,2014-07-08 18:13:00,729,"For me it depends on the lure, e.g., for jerkbaits - I like wire for the action and little added weight; for swimbaits - heavy flouro to keep the bait up; gliders - flouro. Actually, the only rod I have a wire leader tied to is my jerkbait rod.  I usually tie 50lb flouro leaders for pike. I keep a key eye on them and replace when needed. For swimbaits or tubes I sometimes go to 100lb. The only pike I've broken off due to leader issues have been on broken snaps. But maybe I've been lucky. I have yet to try the tieable wire leader material but will be.  If you're asking if leaders are necessary for pike - yes they are 100% needed. If you need something easy, a few packs of 30lb wire leaders is all you need."
862166,mattaw,2014-07-08 18:14:00,162,"I have used both. I like floro, but I started to use Malins Boa No Kink Titanimum leaders. They're a bit hard to tie at first, but once you get the hang of it they're great but a bit pricey. I have not had any major issues with line kink, even after larger pike. I like the peace of mind that I don't have to worry about getting bitten off. That being said I still carry floro and mono with me in the boat (in the 90-100 range), incase I need to make a switch. For topwaters I only use the mono as I find any line that sinks hurts the action of my baits."
862167,BillM,2014-07-08 18:15:00,17367,"When running 80-100lb flouro, I really don't worry about getting off.   Haven't yet.   I also gotta think there was a defect that caused the break, have you seen how thick 80lb flouro is?  it's almost rope"
862168,lew,2014-07-08 18:20:00,12766,"I always used wire on my musky set-ups but got tired of them kinking with every decent fish.  I switched over to 130 pound Seaguar fluoro  8 or 10 years ago and have never had an issue with them.  I make my own leaders using crimps and # 5 or 6 snaps & swivels and use 10"" for jerk/twitch baits, 16-18"" for casting and 48"" for trolling.  Excellent stuff."
862176,msp,2014-07-08 18:50:00,1336,Defective leader material ? Um no. Big fish + small baits + 100pound flouro = bite off
862177,BillM,2014-07-08 18:51:00,17367,Defective leader material ? Um no. Big fish + small baits + 100pound flouro = bite off  You must be the unluckiest guy in the world if you're getting bit off using 100lb flouro.
862189,msp,2014-07-08 19:48:00,1336,I fish pike from March till December so the odds of bite offs would be higher than average I guess
862197,TennesseeGuy,2014-07-08 20:18:00,957,100# Seaguar fluoro has been good to me.   I match the OD of fluoro with ID of double sleeves for a firm grip on my loops.  I wouldn't consider going back to wire.
862200,solopaddler,2014-07-08 20:25:00,8605,"Heavy fluoro most of the time for me.  When I'm throwing lighter stickbaits like the largest Husky Jerks it's 20lb titanium. The heavy fluoro sinks too much and impedes the action of the lure.  That said 90% of the big pike I catch are never hooked that deep, fact of the matter a leader isn't even necessary. Still need one just in case though."
862208,bare foot wader,2014-07-08 20:37:00,1354,"is the OP looking for store bought, or wants to make your own? strictly pike fishing or walleye too I'd guess?  I'm about 50/50 mono/fluoro vs steel or titanium wire....use the titanium wire for lighter baits and plastics in the weeds, cuts through easier  if I'm targeting walleyes and know there will be some good sized pike involved, I like the titanium wire in 6-12lb tests, specifically a brand called Knot 2 Kinky, easy to tie once you get the hang of it, relatively kink proof and doesn't affect action too much  big fan of the Rio steel tippet in the fly section, few manufacturers with similar products  if you're buying store bought, make sure they come with a good snap, a lot of the cheap ones don't, sucks when they pull open"

I almost never use a swivel and snap for my leaders. I find in most cases I like the action of my baits when tied direct to my leader material. It may be that a lot of the time I fish super heavy weeds and I find the different parts collect gunk though  I find the direct tie just slices through the weeds.  Besides when using a spoon or something with a high line twist, why do you like the snap and swivel for fishing? I've never noticed much line twist tying direct with a double uni or a improved albright knot. I guess it's personal preference?"
