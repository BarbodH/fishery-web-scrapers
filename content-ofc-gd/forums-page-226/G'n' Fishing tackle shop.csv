862089,adam lancia,2014-07-08 03:00:00,234,"Hi all, I'm wondering if the this little shop is still in business? The guy did/does a bunch of custom tackle and he's on the way to my parents cottage on Kennisis Lake. He is/was right on Kenisis Lake road past West Guilford a little ways. Any info is greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance!"
862108,singingdog,2014-07-08 10:08:00,1047,No. Penny and Larry closed up shop about a year ago.
862275,adam lancia,2014-07-09 01:20:00,234,Crap! I was hoping to get some more of Larry's spinnerbaits. Any idea if he was able to unload all of his tackle?
862310,singingdog,2014-07-09 11:24:00,1047,They eventually got rid of all of it. Raising german shepherds now.
862445,adam lancia,2014-07-10 00:26:00,234,"Gotcha, thanks for the info."
862496,singingdog,2014-07-10 10:21:00,1047,Sorry I can't point you elsewhere. Tackle shops in this area are lamentably poor. Even the CT in Minden is pretty lame.
862510,adam lancia,2014-07-10 13:20:00,234,"Yeah, it's a tough go for them considering so many people who fish up that way are cottagers and buy their tackle in the city. Do you know who Larry sold his stock to?"
862632,singingdog,2014-07-11 09:51:00,1047,"Nope, sorry. I got a bunch of the fly/jig tying stuff. I do know that one person came and cleaned them out in the end....no idea who."
862714,adam lancia,2014-07-12 02:30:00,234,I see. I'll have to drop in next time I'm passing by. Thanks again!
