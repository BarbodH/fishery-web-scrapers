862252,captpierre,2014-07-08 23:26:00,2521,Can't find much on Spoonpullers lately.  Any decent action down there yet?  Would like to get out this next week
862259,BillM,2014-07-08 23:54:00,17367,Been garbage out in Lake O on the north shore so far this season.   Lack of reports on SP pretty much confirms it.
862284,Gallie,2014-07-09 01:58:00,1215,"I went out of the bluffs on sat at noon, we fished 1200 till dusk in super choppy super cold (51-54 degree) water. We got 4 kings in the first 3 hours than nothing. Smallest 8 biggest 15lb, two on flies two on anchovie, hope this helps. It should be pretty good by the weekend"
862333,Lunkerhunter,2014-07-09 14:24:00,455,"that's too bad to hear the bite is off right now, what do you think the reason is for that?  I went out once from whitby last week and got skunked. brutal. don't think I was skunked once the last 3 years."
862337,BillM,2014-07-09 14:47:00,17367,"Super cold winter, things are really behind.  Maybe a bit of a food die off as well (Smelt, alewife?)"
862348,Gallie,2014-07-09 17:29:00,1215,On the south shore it sounds like there is record levels of bait. All we need is favourable winds and temps and the baitfish and kings will be around. I wouldnt be surprised to see a 15-20 fish day when i go out sat if conditions have shaped up.
862401,Steve,2014-07-09 21:24:00,2075,"15-20 fish day? i ""would"" be surprised .... very surprised."
862427,BillM,2014-07-09 23:16:00,17367,"15-20 marks maybe, lol."
862431,John Bacon,2014-07-09 23:21:00,3277,"We only caught one little shaker a week an half ago; but I was marking lots of bait fish.  Actually, it was one and half if you count the fact that we re-caught the same shaker... minus the fillets"
862432,BillM,2014-07-09 23:22:00,17367,"Well at least there's bait out there, appears to be about the only thing.   August *should* be on fire."
862474,Gallie,2014-07-10 02:19:00,1215,Last year we had a few days that were 15-20 so i dont see why thats so funny. We fish 3-5 people in the boat with a 5-8 rod spread and generally put in at least 9-10hour per day.
862485,BillM,2014-07-10 04:05:00,17367,"Last year we had a few days that were 15-20 so i dont see why thats so funny. We fish 3-5 people in the boat with a 5-8 rod spread and generally put in at least 9-10hour per day.  Last year isn't like this year, not even close.   You forget the winter we had and how much it's delayed the fishing?"
862502,Gallie,2014-07-10 11:50:00,1215,"I realise that, it will definitely hurt the overall size of the fish but unless there was a die off ( which i doubt) than there should still be numbers. I will reserve judgement until i fish a day of surface water over 60 degrees and can see what kind of year it really is."
862503,Tim Mills,2014-07-10 12:07:00,476,"Last Sunday I went out off PC with a 2 boat group. Our boat went 1 for 2.  The fish below was caught on a blue green spoon 40 down in 200 FOW on a dipsey.  The lost fish was on the downrigger.  The other boat did well.  I think they caught 6 or 8 fish.  3 bows- 8lbs, a couple of shakers and a smaller chinook I think.  I think all the bows were on Lead Core 500ft back. We spoke to a large charter boat at the dock they were out in the morning and got 4 bows.  I fished off Bronte last night 5 -930.  We marked more fish and bait in shallower water but got no hits.  Went out a week and a half ago off Bronte as well same results-nothing.  We checked the temps with a fish hawk probe that gives you readings every 5 ft.  It said the near bottom temp was 39 and the temps closer to the surface was 51.  "
862504,Sinker,2014-07-10 12:32:00,8692,"It will happen. Once the lake stratifies, the fish will be easier to find. Right now they're spread out all over.  A few calm hot days would be nice...  S."
862513,wallacio,2014-07-10 13:52:00,475,^ exactly right.
862542,AKRISONER,2014-07-10 15:55:00,5558,"I dont know if you fish any other lakes for other species, but the pike, walley bass bite was literally 3 weeks late this year.  I even had some of my best fishing for pickerel ever on Canada Day which is usually a write of on Huron, I couldn't believe it."
862605,Rich Nelson,2014-07-10 23:23:00,332,
862607,Steve,2014-07-10 23:35:00,2075,that's correct  fact remains we are less than a month away from the first stagers showing up.
