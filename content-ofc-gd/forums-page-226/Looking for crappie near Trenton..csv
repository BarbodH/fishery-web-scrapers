862566,Larry30,2014-07-10 19:38:00,1,Hey all.  I was just wondering if anyone could enlighten me on spots to fish crappie around the Trenton Ontario area? From shore would be preferable. I am willing to have to drive a short distance. 45 minute drive in any direction from Trenton is ok.  Thanks in advance.
862572,Big Cliff,2014-07-10 20:11:00,6899,"Well Larry, good luck with that one! First of all no one is just going to give up their favorite crappie (or any other spots) openly on the board. You might as well just Google it, you'd probably have better luck.  Now, a good way to start might be to introduce yourself, give us some background, let us know a little about you and what you might have to offer in return. You see, with over 9000 members on here the information that is available is almost unlimited. Unfortunatly we get (help me out here mods)????? # of visits a day from people that have no desire to give anything back but would like us to make them the #1 fisherman. I have been a member of this board for a very long time and even I wouldn't come out and ask for spots. (well, after 15+ years, I might but I have also shared so I know I would get help).  Welcome to the board, join in, become a member and you will be amazed at how much help you will get!"
