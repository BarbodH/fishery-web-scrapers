That sucks. Another quality fishing product going down the tubes.  Edit: Their website address is also for sale  http://www.beckmannet.com/"
863122,miller,2014-07-14 23:56:00,223,"Heard the news, best nets out there. Contemplating buying another just to save as a backup."
863139,Handlebarz,2014-07-15 00:43:00,3790,Glad I just got another new one I love the nets.
863140,OhioFisherman,2014-07-15 00:46:00,6623,I believe Pradco owns a bunch of outfits.   http://www.lurenet.com/
863158,porkpie,2014-07-15 02:27:00,2521,Loki nets are an excellent alternative!
863161,Steve,2014-07-15 02:35:00,2075,"yes, they sure are! I bought my first Loki net in 2005.  handle is long bent and gone, but netting and rim still stand strong."
863162,Wagoneer,2014-07-15 02:58:00,118,It's a shame. People just aren't willing to purchase quality products that last anymore. All people care about is the price. You find this with camping products as well. Some of the best companies are going out of the business because their top of the line products are too expensive. It's the times we live in!
863244,fishindevil,2014-07-15 20:14:00,6254,Yup beckman  nets are quality and usually last a lifetime well built & solid !!! Too bad I need a new net too I guess I will have to try and find one or get a Loki bet !!!
