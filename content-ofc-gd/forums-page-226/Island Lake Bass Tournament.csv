862732,bobowski,2014-07-12 13:02:00,360,Does anyone know the results of the island lake tourney last weekend? I fished the tournament on the Saturday but not on Sunday. Just curious if anyone knows the size of the fish that won. Fishing was tough on Saturday for me. Caught a 1 pound Bass but that was it. Weeds were really thick.

Same story for me, there were a lot of good fish that came in late on saturday though, seemed the dam was the place to be."
