This year that never worked out but we were able to squeeze in a couple of nights and 1 full day of fishing. I can't remember the last time I was on Nipissing when musky and bass season's were open.   The adventure starts.    Always a tough walleye bite when this happens:    That's the remnants of the mayfly hatch. Both the bass and the walleye were stuffed full of them.  Still had some topwater action.    My biggest bass in a long time was while I was solo and no camera. Nice 21 inch smallmouth on a zara just before dark. Funny, with all the fishing we do together all of my biggest fish the last 2 years have all been while fishing by myself. Thinking he's bad luck.  Because of the mayflies my brother went with a crayfish crankbait. Caught one eye casting in five feet of water.    And he caught this one drifting with the same crank behind a bottom walker in 20 feet.     Drifting a small jointed rapala behind the bottom walker.    I used the slowdeath hook and a gulp worm behind the bottom walker and caught a few small eyes with it.    Casting a x-rap in a new spot.    Casting a cicada (newly purchased at Cabelas because I knew the mayflies were hatching) on a shoal.       Remember, wear sunscreen.    Many fishermen spend all their lives without realising it's not fish they are after.    Until the next time...   "

862852,kickingfrog,2014-07-13 14:23:00,8333,Thanks Lew.  There was some weeds but I'm not the best one to give perspective because I haven't been there in early July for about 20 years. There were spots that had weeds that were to the surface in six feet of water.
862853,lew,2014-07-13 14:28:00,12766,"Thanks Rob, sounds like their finally growing.  I'm not heading back up for another month so hopefully they'll be good by then."
862862,woodenboater,2014-07-13 15:28:00,2277,"yup, gorgeous scenery and sunsets always makes up for slow bite. and btw, are you and your brother keeping a running tally"
862863,Old Ironmaker,2014-07-13 15:28:00,8243,"Very well done, including the skin on Bro's face. I miss Nippissing, it's been 20 years now. Need to fight that traffic and get up there.  Great trip, great report. You 2 guys look like a before and after makeover on Steven and Chris. Cool how 2 guys can be so different and be so much alike at the same time."
862867,Joeytier,2014-07-13 15:34:00,3990,"Looks like a great time with some quality wally fishing.  Good average size for nip too, some of them must have made the cut for the new slot?"
862873,mike rousseau,2014-07-13 16:09:00,4661,Awesome report  Those walleye look tasty...
862876,kickingfrog,2014-07-13 16:36:00,8333,"yup, gorgeous scenery and sunsets always makes up for slow bite. and btw, are you and your brother keeping a running tally  I don't. Don't think he does. We pay enough attention to know who did ""better"" on a particular day but we also try to use 2 different tactics at the same time."

Yep, I'm Felix and he is Oscar.  Looks like a great time with some quality wally fishing. Good average size for nip too, some of them must have made the cut for the new slot? Compared to early June when we normally fish the fish were smaller and didn't go after the trolled baits at all. We kept 2 of the 4 legal fish.  Awesome report  Those walleye look tasty...  They were."

862906,kickingfrog,2014-07-13 20:05:00,8333,Now that I've found my list I might head over this week sometime.
862931,Rod Caster,2014-07-13 21:38:00,5784,Always enjoy your Nip reports. No 'big' ones this time? Usually you end up with a few real nice ones.
862939,kickingfrog,2014-07-13 23:05:00,8333,"Nope, the ""big ones"" were all slightly over 20 inches. The prevailing theory is that the bigger fish are deeper and/or suspended by this time in July. It was nice to fish in warmer weather but the fish are a little harder to figure out."
862959,lookinforwalleye,2014-07-14 00:47:00,4399,Nice report Rob...I do miss the Nip it was a special place in my younger years!!!
