862345,bushart,2014-07-09 16:41:00,2628,Strange...I posted my boat for sale on Kijiji---and have 2 separate inquiries about selling just my motor---one guy from London--long ways away  I'm thinkin can't be too many used ones around  Weird
862355,sauce,2014-07-09 18:27:00,219,Have you ever looked into buying a new outboard motor? Many people are shocked when they see the price tag on a brand new one.
862379,Sinker,2014-07-09 20:24:00,8692,"Yep, a new 40hp yammy is pushing 8K......I bought mine for just under 4K brand new in '94. I cant find a replacement now...unless I go new.  S."
862390,bushart,2014-07-09 20:47:00,2628,Yeah likely why buddy can't seem to buy it fast enough  and cleaner now than it's been in years---is'nt that how sellin works  
862396,porkpie,2014-07-09 21:10:00,2521,"Big tillers have always been hard to find.  Costs are huge now too, as mentioned!  That's a nice looking boat!"
862398,Steve,2014-07-09 21:17:00,2075,"they have risen a lot recently as well.  i only paid 8k for my 50 hp yammy tiller with the trolling control buttons, taxes in, in 2009.  now that motor is close to $10k.  25% increase in five years?"
862402,bushart,2014-07-09 21:29:00,2628,I think I paid 6500 for the motor alone back in 96  Yeah she was a great boat and buddy's gettin a deal-----it runs great---deep v hull---just downsizin (stems from downsizin my vehicle---which stems from the current cost of fuel)
862408,mike rousseau,2014-07-09 21:54:00,4661,A 50hp 4 stroke merc tiller with upgraded tiller arm is $9500-$10000...  Used ones sell like hot cakes
862409,bushart,2014-07-09 22:04:00,2628,Yeah I'm seein that from my kijiji responses
862416,mattp33,2014-07-09 22:36:00,290,"Any used motor is hard to get, I am looking at re-powering my boat from a 115-150 and its crazy how much they are!!!"
862454,Fisherman,2014-07-10 00:50:00,7201,A 50hp 4 stroke merc tiller with upgraded tiller arm is $9500-$10000...  Used ones sell like hot cakes You can get anchors much cheaper than that at Princess Auto..
862462,DRIFTER_016,2014-07-10 01:18:00,10439,"Any used motor is hard to get, I am looking at re-powering my boat from a 115-150 and its crazy how much they are!!!  I upgraded from a 90 two stroke to a 115 four stroke last year and it lightened my wallet by $14.5K!!!! The whole boat/motor/TM/trailer combo was $19.5K when I bought it new in '91."
862464,mike rousseau,2014-07-10 01:23:00,4661,Lmao  I went Yamaha out of NY state for $7200 for a 50hp 4 stroke with tank and prop...  Gotta shop around and explore your options...
862471,bushart,2014-07-10 01:56:00,2628,My Merc has served me very well
862476,Old Ironmaker,2014-07-10 02:31:00,8243,"Buddy bought a used 115 Merc E Tec last year for 12K and thought it was a great deal. I paid a tad more for a like new 14 year old 115 Merc 5 years ago and they threw in a 19' Starcraft and the trailer for free. Considering I stopped to pick up a few things at the store today and didn't even get a cart and it came to 73 bucks, no one shopping for toys can complain. I don't know how 2 working people with a few kids can even think about fishing today. Sad."
862498,Fisherman,2014-07-10 10:51:00,7201,My Merc has served me very well ..as long as it holds tight and you don't start drifting...
862501,bushart,2014-07-10 11:34:00,2628,And yet another person e-mailing me this morn looking to buy just my motor--gonna have to get it off kijiji I guess once buddy put cash in my mitt
862509,scugpg,2014-07-10 13:19:00,1373,I had this exact motor up till this year and it was great. Got an amazing trade in toward a new engine. Believe these were actually yamaha powerheads on these.  Have you got a new boat yet? Might be worth seeing what trade you could get at a dealer as the tillers are in demand?
862562,bushart,2014-07-10 18:33:00,2628,Yes I'm told they were Yamaha powerheads
862567,dwc67,2014-07-10 19:41:00,140,thanks good to know i am putting up my 18 alaskan up with a 50 honda tiller and this thread just put the price up
862571,Steve,2014-07-10 20:08:00,2075,that new floor you put in your boat dave is sweet!  I'm sure you'll get good dollars for your boat.
