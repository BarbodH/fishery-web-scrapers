861800,Handlebarz,2014-07-06 11:50:00,3790,Oh yeah we are booked for the weekend camping and can't wait for it. Just three more weekends to go. For the early birds we have donated something extea this year but only 200 or so better get there early.  We are going to be doing a very small auction again this time it's a trip from will and a trip from myself. My wife and I wanted to do a big one but things just did not work out. A big thanks to Will for donating his fishing trip I will post details later.
