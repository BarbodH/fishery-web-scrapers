862394,Gerritt,2014-07-09 20:58:00,6129,"Yup! Seems to be a battle of the defences. Brazilians will not be happy to see Argentina in the finals... They do not like each other, you will see Brazil root for ANY other team over Argentina!"
862415,Gerritt,2014-07-09 22:33:00,6129,Shoot out!
862417,davey buoy,2014-07-09 22:37:00,5505,"Quite the different game from yesterday.I'm not sure I like the shoot out?,Let's see what happens."
862419,Steve,2014-07-09 22:46:00,2075,Germany > Argentina.  i'm calling a spread of 3 or more.
862420,Gerritt,2014-07-09 22:55:00,6129,"While I am not happy Holland is out. I would like to see Argentina win, given all the turmoil and money Brazil has spent, despite their people living in squalor.. Nothing would burn the Brazilians more and embarrass their government then Argentina winning the cup... Might teach their government something?   Doubtful.... But would sure rub salt in the Brazilian officials wounds.  Might happen quietly but heads will roll....billions spent only to see their most hated win! With them hosting! Karma.  G  Edit to add the history between Brazil and Argentina in regards to football http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/ArgentinaBrazil_football_rivalry"
862422,misfish,2014-07-09 22:57:00,29133,This shoot out stuff is crap. No sport should have this. Play til one team scores. Sad way to end a game.
862423,davey buoy,2014-07-09 22:59:00,5505,"This shoot out stuff is crap. No sport should have this. Play til one team scores. Sad way to end a game. Same as hockey,play till they can't and someone scores .Agreed!"
862424,lookinforwalleye,2014-07-09 23:12:00,4399,Wow that was exciting watching a bunch of guys play keep away for 2 hours....
862425,bushart,2014-07-09 23:14:00,2628,"Same as hockey,play till they can't and someone scores .Agreed!   This was my singles bar motto in the 70's"
862430,misfish,2014-07-09 23:20:00,29133,Wow that was exciting watching a bunch of guys play keep away for 2 hours....  YA  Germany will feast on that game.
862436,leaf4,2014-07-09 23:32:00,2466,"yeah, listening to the announcers they hit the nail on the head, something to the effect of the dutch didn't play to win they played to survive, and also didn't change it up enough in terms of their formation, one thing they could've benefited from saving that last sub for the other goalie like they did in the last game"
862439,BillM,2014-07-09 23:34:00,17367,"Same as hockey,play till they can't and someone scores .Agreed!  Yup, hate the shootouts."
862511,Steve,2014-07-10 13:23:00,2075,"but the way the argentina holland game was going, if there wasn't a shootout, the game STILL may be going....."
862546,AKRISONER,2014-07-10 16:00:00,5558,"dont forget, Argentina scored but got it called back...  Ive got a lot of money riding on Germany winning...#officepoolchampion"
862547,BillM,2014-07-10 16:01:00,17367,"but the way the argentina holland game was going, if there wasn't a shootout, the game STILL may be going.....  Yeah the game was a bit of a snooze to be honest.  Both teams were playing to not lose."
862896,Steve,2014-07-13 18:57:00,2075,and it begins.....  lets go Germany!!!
862898,davey buoy,2014-07-13 19:02:00,5505,Should be a descent game.Go Germany as well!!
862899,misfish,2014-07-13 19:06:00,29133,I seen a few fellas wearing Brazil shirts today. Thats team loyalty.  Go Germany
862908,Old Ironmaker,2014-07-13 20:07:00,8243,"It should be Mesi 2 Germany 1, but it's 0-0, that's football."

862922,Steve,2014-07-13 21:07:00,2075,at least it'll be another four years before watching this stuff again....  by then I'll forget how boring this sport is
862929,Steve,2014-07-13 21:29:00,2075,goal.  thumbs up!
862932,Steve,2014-07-13 21:38:00,2075,Well...i did call Germany by 3....and that sure didn't come close to happening...  but....   I sure wish I was in Germany RIGHT NOW!!!!!!
862201,davey buoy,2014-07-08 20:27:00,5505,4-0 Germany in only 25 min against Brazil.All hell may break loose after this game!!!
862202,misfish,2014-07-08 20:29:00,29133,"I,ll be working in a happy plant come morning.Might even get friday off to fish.LOL  5-0  This is ugly.  Lets hope not Davey"
862203,Dan668,2014-07-08 20:29:00,1120,Lol.  Make it 5. Embarassing defense.
862204,davey buoy,2014-07-08 20:29:00,5505,"5-0 now,what a slaughter so far!!"
862206,Dan668,2014-07-08 20:30:00,1120,Loving it.
862209,kickingfrog,2014-07-08 20:38:00,8333,Well I guess I'll go do something else.  No rooting interest. No money wagered. Just wanted a competitive match.
862213,leaf4,2014-07-08 20:49:00,2466,"riots in the streets of Brazil!! lol this is brutal, how do you make it this far and just fall apart"
862214,misfish,2014-07-08 21:00:00,29133,"riots in the streets of Brazil!! lol this is brutal, how do you make it this far and just fall apart  It,s like this  Leafs vs Boston game 7 series. Remember that?   LOL"
862215,davey buoy,2014-07-08 21:08:00,5505," It,s like this  Leafs vs Boston game 7 series. Remember that?   LOL You had to bring that up again  lol."
862217,Gerritt,2014-07-08 21:16:00,6129,"Let's all just sit back... And watch Holland destroy their competition.  No one care who wins this.... As we care about is who holland plays, just so we knows who to bash!   Hup Holland Hup!  G"
862223,davey buoy,2014-07-08 21:35:00,5505,"7-0,my word.record defeat"
862225,misfish,2014-07-08 21:42:00,29133,"Let's all just sit back... And watch Holland destroy their competition.  No one care who wins this.... As we care about is who holland plays, just so we knows who to bash!   Hup Holland Hup!  G   Easy G.  I WANT NEXT FRIDAY OFF AS WELL LOL"
862226,leaf4,2014-07-08 21:43:00,2466,hopefully they use up all their offense in this one and holland gets through to a clean win in the final
862228,misfish,2014-07-08 21:47:00,29133,Goalllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll  
862232,Gerritt,2014-07-08 21:57:00,6129,"Wouldn't that be something.... holland vs. the country that tried occupied them? The same country That canada liberated?  Being a Dutch Canadian this is an important match to many that immigrated here... Alot of history, a lot of stories, a lot of families will be talking about this... And where they came from as dutch Canadians,  Many dutch have support from around the world. If against Germany.. That much is certain!  G"
862234,Burtess,2014-07-08 22:03:00,901,"I never looked at the game of soccer from that kind of political standpoint  My background is quite mixed but my father was born in Germany.  Anyone asks him what nationality he is and he says ""Canadian"".  Let's just hope for a good game (and just a game)  Burt"
862237,Handlebarz,2014-07-08 22:11:00,3790,When does this world cup thing start?  Im not a soccer fan at all but its good for the bars I had to wait to get into The Dizzy Sports Pub in Toronto on Saturday as it was actually packed onto the side walk with people watching the game. I can not watch it way to long and boring
862238,lookinforwalleye,2014-07-08 22:19:00,4399,There was a soccer game on????  Let me know when Canada qualifies okay!!!
862240,Steve,2014-07-08 22:23:00,2075,"although I'm 50% German background, so biased, I just don't see how Holland (if they win) is going to even compete with Germany.  I just hope it is a somewhat close game...."
862242,davey buoy,2014-07-08 22:24:00,5505,"There was a soccer game on????  Let me know when Canada qualifies okay!!! Maybe in 4 years?,hearing rumours 64 teams may qualify instead of 32.We'll have to wait and see.That could be our year  ."
862285,moxie,2014-07-09 02:19:00,1566,Brasilia stomped on like a common house fly by the German maschine!!! Just another display of utter superiority. All that is left for me to see is a Holland thrashing of Argentina and all will be as it should be in the world according to Footy. A European champion and nothing less.
862294,BillM,2014-07-09 03:14:00,17367,"That was embarrassing. Brazil never should have made it to the semis in the first place... Hell, not even out of the round robin!"
862374,davey buoy,2014-07-09 19:59:00,5505,Friendly bet on this afternons game? anyone?Netherlands for me !
862378,Gerritt,2014-07-09 20:23:00,6129,"It should be a tough match, but I see Netherlands pulling out the W.  G"
862392,leaf4,2014-07-09 20:51:00,2466,Netherlands need to get the offense going like they had against Spain!
