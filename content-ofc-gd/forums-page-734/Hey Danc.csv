426933,danc,2010-01-28 22:53:00,4677,Actually Joe I was looking into it last weekend. I'll get it up and running this weekend for sure. That will give folks two full weeks to sign up for the full season. I'll post when it's ready. See ya there...
426943,Daplumma,2010-01-28 23:05:00,1961,Sweet!

I sure hope so!  i was just thinking of the fantasy league today while out on my tractor, dang thing wouldnt go fast enough though.  i look forward to another fun filled season of smack talk.  jason"
427115,SlowPoke,2010-01-29 04:22:00,2984,I think I'm gonna take a pass this year. I suffered a total and complete whoopin' last year and I don't think I had a chance to see an entire race. This year isn't looking much better! Have fun boys!
