This newbie to ice fishing wants to know if I should go out first thing in the am tomorrow( no shelter) or wait a few hours and go for the ""afternoon bite"".   Thanks"

427337,Sinker,2010-01-29 21:32:00,8692,"Yep, water temp thru the ice is pretty much the same all season, and throughout the whole water column. The warmer water will actually be 4 degrees C, and on bottom. Barometric pressure, and lunar cycles will still effect fish though.  S."
