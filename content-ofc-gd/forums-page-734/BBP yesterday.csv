427170,ROOK,2010-01-29 12:42:00,55,fished from 7-11am = insane weather out on the lake ...  started off with winds at 14 kmh and then by 11 they were 45 gusting to 60 !!!!  plus all the streamers and blowing snow gave visibility at times down to a few metres ... all that for fish I couldn't even keep ... managed only 3 herring for that effort.  Oh well it was better than a day in the office !! ROOK
