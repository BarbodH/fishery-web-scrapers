Have you tried calling any of the local bait shops up there?  they should know....off the top of m head there's Minnow Man in Bracebridge, and Bait on the Lake just outside Bala...BOTL is my go-to guy...I'd give him a call.  From everything I've heard, I'd head out on foot with no worries, but, I don't have any solid info for you regarding that portion of the lake."

I was thinking if the ice wasn't good I would head up Rosseau way and share the wealth at a local bait shop up there.  GR"
