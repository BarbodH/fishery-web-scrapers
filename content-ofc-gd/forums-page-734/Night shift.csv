427417,moemoe,2010-01-30 02:17:00,352,"At work right now, I don't mind the nights, but working friday and satruday night always makes me dislike my job....that being said I work 4 days on and 5 days off, I wouldn't trade anything for my 5 days off"
427418,danbouck,2010-01-30 02:22:00,4380,I'm at work right now but I'm working on the sled... well I was until I checked here!
427780,mossyoak_ontario,2010-01-31 00:56:00,12,"    i spend most of my 12 hour shift rippin a sled around blue mountain,  where you sledding for work??"
427781,danbouck,2010-01-31 00:59:00,4380," I meant that I was doing some maintenance on it, I wish I could take the sled for work!"
427829,Photoz,2010-01-31 10:56:00,792,

426640,mossyoak_ontario,2010-01-28 08:34:00,12,"Im stuck here at blue mountain snowmaking checking OFC posts and fieldandstream.com for entertainment between checks, anyone else out there stuck workin nights?"
426641,lew,2010-01-28 08:50:00,12766,"Alternated between day & night shifts for 33 years but have been enjoying the good life for close to a decade now, but still enjoy the early morning part of the day the best."
426642,Marko,2010-01-28 08:51:00,854,Just got home myself man. Not sure if you can call it  completely a night shift when u get home at 4 am but hey close enough.
426647,mossyoak_ontario,2010-01-28 09:27:00,12,well at least im not the only fish head checkin OFC at these hours.  Somethin' has to keep me saine between checkin snow guns
426658,dave524,2010-01-28 12:05:00,4508," Same here, alternating 12 hour days and nights, seven days a week for the best part of thirty years , then got on a Monday to Friday job 7-3 and 3-11 for the 4 years. Retired now too, wish I could have had internet access to pass the slow times at work   Believe me and Lew, there is a light at the end of the tunnel."
426659,BITEME,2010-01-28 12:10:00,1968,Loved Night Shifts  early morning about an hour before the sun comes up THE BEST
426660,JEREMY,2010-01-28 12:39:00,300,Yup i have been doing the night shift thing for about 8 years solid now.
426666,solopaddler,2010-01-28 13:11:00,8605,"I cram my 40 hour work week into 3 days, Mon-Wed each week including 2 night shifts. Many weeks I don't sleep from Mon morning when I wake up 'till late Wed night. That leaves me Thurs-Sun off each week. Lots of free time but I'm paying a price. I think I've ages 10 years since I started doing it."
426671,crappieperchhunter,2010-01-28 13:22:00,2582,"I've never had a problem with the night shift. Work 12 hour shifts 7-7,rotating days and nights. When we lived close to Lake Ontario I used to get home in the morning make a coffee or grab a beer... whichever mood I was in... and head down to the lake with the dogs. Let them run around on the beach while I sat back and relaxed and watched the world wake up. It was a routine I really enjoyed."
426674,cityfisher,2010-01-28 13:32:00,959,i only did it for 1 year..... liked it at times but felt like a zombie most of the time... NO MORE !
426678,ketchenany,2010-01-28 13:36:00,3229," I did it for  nine Lew, not pretty at all . . ."
426683,Bernie,2010-01-28 13:49:00,3190,"Did midnights driving transport for 6 straight years. Loved it. No traffic, only moose to watch out for."
426702,Spiel,2010-01-28 14:27:00,9065,"Over 30 years of rotating shifts for me, days, afternoons and nights. Then came the 12 hour shifts about 10 years ago, flip from nights to days and back again every week. That's tiring!  As I get older I like the nights less and less but the 12 hour shifts do allow for more time off which is good.  Don't think I'd ever want to go back to an 8 hour, 3 shift pattern."
426706,crappieperchhunter,2010-01-28 14:31:00,2582,  Same with me Chris. For now I am stuck on 8's...days and afternoons only. But we maybe going back to the 12's. I'm praying for it. Loved the extra days off...and only having to work 2 or 3 days in a row between days off.
426720,Spiel,2010-01-28 14:54:00,9065, Exactly.
426721,JohnF,2010-01-28 15:00:00,3494, Did you by any chance start doing this 10 years ago?  JF
426723,Fish4Eyes,2010-01-28 15:07:00,1022," I was wondering how the heck you get out fishing so much, especially with kids."
426751,solopaddler,2010-01-28 16:23:00,8605, Smart  
426756,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-01-28 16:32:00,0,when i'm in field season  i work a lot of nights and overtimes.  i find i end up in some sort of daze when i'm on nights.
427142,mossyoak_ontario,2010-01-29 08:05:00,12,what about tonight fella's?  anyone else at the grind right now?
427149,Andy,2010-01-29 10:58:00,330,"Just going to bed after a 12 hr nightshift. After 4 to 5 hours sleep this morning, I'll be in a zombie-like state all afternoon, and likely lying wide awake in bed later tonight hoping it doesn't take too long to fall asleep."
427167,gdelongchamp,2010-01-29 12:35:00,199,"I worked n/s at the mine 7 to 3 for years and went home at 4 in the morning. Lived on an island so I enjoyed the boat ride at dawn. June, and September were the nicest times of the year due to the morning fogs and late sunrises which extended dawn by an hour or so. The colors on the water and sky were phenomenal."
427276,supernaut,2010-01-29 18:04:00,46,I've been at for 25 years working shift work!.. Now I'm working= 4 9.5 hr shift afternoons for 3 weeks and then rotate onto a 3 12 hr shift that starts at midnight...  It's aged me about 10 years
427285,spinnerbaitking,2010-01-29 18:16:00,1622,"I work 12's Mon Tues  days F S S nights W T days & so on 7 til 7, then switch around when some one goes on holidays, no access to the internet though while working Richard"
427296,Andy,2010-01-29 18:45:00,330,"Yeah, that's mine as well. Gotta love the turn arounds, especially going in Wed a.m.  after the weekend nights. All in all tho, it can open up a lot of time off for short fishing trips."
