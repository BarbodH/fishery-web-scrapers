We were originally going for pike and FM managed to catch 2 small pike, but still PB smallest for his self. The fishing for them was slow and I ended the day off with another solid 12"" Perch. We caught about a half dozen smaller perch but aside from that we had a great day out there.  Enjoy Alex with the first of the day   And him again with the 2nd and the PB Smallest of the day lol   And then my Perch that I caught on a tip-up   Had a fun time fishing today, thanks for watching. Stay tuned for a report off of Simcoe for myself this weekend! MTBF   O and yes, I forgot to mention that Alex pulling the sled came into direct contact with a old frozen over hole and fell right through it lol. Thankfully I pulled him out right away to safety"
