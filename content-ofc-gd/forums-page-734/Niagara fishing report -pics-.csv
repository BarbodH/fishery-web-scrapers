427144,Cast Adventures,2010-01-29 09:07:00,74,"Hey everyone!  Haven't posted anything for some time now.....As of Monday afternoon the Niagara blew out again, right now its brown and packed full of ice......Lake Erie hasn't locked up with ice yet so every time we get strong SW, W winds conditions turn for the worst. Erie's water temps are 32 and only 20% of the lake has ice.....kind of a wacked year to say the least..If the winds will just stay down for a bit, the ice will have a chance to set up....But we have had some great fishing, last week conditions were prime and the anglers were doing well both from shore and from the boats. Classic winter steelhead persentations are producing fish! The bite can really change from day to day.....even hour to hour! A good mix of darkies and fresh silvers are in the system now, seems to be more brown trout this year in the river. Mostly smaller browns with the odd 8-10 lb fish in the mix.......one report of an 18lb brown from a few weeks ago!  I've attached a just few pictures from last thurs-to-Monday morning. Just something to help with the winter blues!            Winter steelhead fishing is just starting in the Niagara region with the best part of the season still to come! 2010 has been outstanding, both for fly fishing and gear! Be safe on the ice, good fishing to all!  see you on the river,  Paul Castellano"
