426841,basketclam,2010-01-28 20:53:00,115,"Hey folks, anyone have experience trying to stock a pond?  I've got a pond that's just under an acre in size, deepest part is about 12 feet.  It gets surface flow in the spring and early summer, but other than that is groundwater fed.  It drops down maybe by a foot or two in the driest of summers.  I'm considering trying to stock it, and would appreciate any tidbits of advice.  Haven't found minnows in there yet, so I'm presuming that the habitat isn't ideal for fish.  Due to very little flowing water coming in, I suspect that I'll likely have to aerate it.  Anybody with experience using a windmill aerator who'd care to comment?  Also, it's my understanding that because it is a private pond that is not online (i.e. a watercourse does not flow into or out of it, and it is not connected to a watercourse in any direct way), I don't need an MNR permit to stock it.  Yay or nay?  The bottom is very muddy without a lot of structure or weeds, so I've been sinking rocks to make piles and will sink some old skids when the pond thaws.  I'd like to start with trying to establish a baitfish population before putting in any ""real"" fish, because ideally I want the pond to be as maintenance free as possible (i.e. no feeding the fish).  I've heard that golden shiners, fathead minnows and central mudminnows are the most suited to my conditions.  I've found one farm nearish to Cambridge that sells fatheads, but they're not available until the middle of the summer (I'd like to get them put in there sooner if possible).  There's one place out toward Kingston with goldens and mudminnows for sale, but that's a long way out of the way.  Anybody know where I might try looking to pick these up the minnows that I want now?  Farms, baitfish shops, etc?  I've emailed a bunch of bait shops and thus far everyone's told me that their minnows are all mixed together and there is never a guarantee that I will get any of the species that I'm looking for.  As for the real fish that I want to stock, I haven't decided if trout or bass/crappie are the way I go.  But baby steps.  I'll consider this dilemma when I get to it.  Any constructive comments would be appreciated."

426872,redneck666,2010-01-28 21:48:00,563,"ya im pretty sure you have to have an mnr permit. but theres a pond i'd like to stock too. it used to be stocked with specks but people caught them all and all thats left is cat fish and suckers, and there isnt even very many of them left. so i'd like to stock it wit hspecks again. its a good sized pond and fairly deep so the specks would do very well provided they get smart haha."
426874,xeon,2010-01-28 21:51:00,350,Call the OMNR.
426891,gbaysteel,2010-01-28 22:09:00,13,I would contact the Pond Specialists. im sure they could answer all of your questions and set you up with all the contacts you would ever need for baitfish and sportfish. I met a pond tech a few years ago that helped restore a pond after a friend had bought the run down property. The pond was  so overgrown with weeds i could almost walk on it. Two years later it was an incredible pond with  self sustaining populations of baitfish and trout.
426925,DRIFTER_016,2010-01-28 22:43:00,10439,"I didn't need a permit when I stocked my pond in Grand Valley. It was also not connected to any waterway. I didn't need to aerate it due to the fact that we had a water to water heat pump doing HVAC duty in the house. It would pump 7 gallons a minute from our well through the heatpump (strip the heat or cool out of the water depending on season) and into the pond. This was plenty to keep enough oxygen in the pond  and also keep it cool enough all summer long for trout to survive. I also stocked minnows as forage and pellet fed them. In 2 years they grew from 12"" to almost 5 pounds!!! The only problem is the darned things got smarter and smarter each time they were caught."

427091,Weeds,2010-01-29 03:14:00,782,"I can remember visiting some freinds quite a few years back in the States (Upstate New York) who had a small pond on their property, definately less than an acre. I believe it was spring fed.  It had no water flowing in or out but I believe had a good population of Largemouth. I also think the pond (and fish) were pretty much maintenance free; although they were stocked at some point many years before.  Maybe toss in a Carp or two just to cover your bases..."
427109,MuskyGreenHorn,2010-01-29 03:44:00,158,"How long has this pond been around?  What is your aquatic vegetation situation like?  Just because there are no fish does nto mean it isn't a healthy and thriving ecosystem.  Have any amphibians taken up residence or use it as a seasonal mating place?  If so, adding fish to the mix will definately change that.  If you do decide to add fish: For minnows, just throw in a mix of stuff.  Nature will sort out what does well and what doesn't.  Mudminnows are some of the tougest customers around in terms of surviving through not so ideal living conditions.  Old spruce trees or pine trees that have dropped their needles make for great structure for baitfish.  Unless it stays relatively cold and has a decent amount of shade, I wouldn't bother with trout.  Panfish, bass, or even cats would be more ideal."
427116,Carp,2010-01-29 04:24:00,1488,"I would think even a small in/out flow would be enough to oxygenate the water. Rainbow trout are probably your best bet if trout is what you had in mind. They can survive a broader temperature range than other trout. Otherwise, the suggestions already made are good ones. LM bass, panfish, minnows, etc.  If you have frogs around the pond, that means tadpoles in spring for the fish to eat. Heck ! If you stock LM bass, they'll eventually start feeding on the adult frogs. Insects will also make up part of the diet. You can feed the fish earth worms from your garden too.  If you don't have any trees around the edge of the pond, plant some. Place them in a position to block some of the sunlight. This will provide shade for the fish, keep the water temps. lower in summer and help with soil erosion. A few cedars near the waters edge should be fine.  Good luck."
427146,Big Cliff,2010-01-29 10:13:00,6899,"I have done a lot of work with the Kawartha Lakes Trout farm but that sure doesn't make me an expert on any of it. There is a lot more to stocking a pond than just dumping fish in it though. In fact, the more I learn the more I realize there is to learn. The most important thing I have learned so far is ""if you are going to do it, do it right the first time"" just dumping stuff in there to see what happens isn't the answer.  The very first thing I would do if I were you is contact: Jeremy Holden Fisheries Biologist  at the OFAH 705-748-6324 ext 268  Jeremy is an extreamly nice young man and really knows his stuff, you won't find a better place to start.  Another place that might be able to help you would be Fleming College here in Lindsay, I believe Hugh Banks is th co-ordinator of the fish and wildlife programs there 705-324-9144 ext. 3355  Perhaps Mike or one of the other students in that program that frequent this board could give you some other names."
427153,Cudz,2010-01-29 11:48:00,2652,"I have a friend with a similar pond.  In the past they tried stocking it with rainbow trout but they could never reproduce so their population quickly eroded to nothing.  Then about 20 years ago about 60 fish were released into the pond (not sure how they got there   ).  There were 5 (2 pound) smallmouth, 5 (2 pound)  largemouth, and about 50 panfish (perch, sunfish, rockbass etc).  THe pond still has a healthy population of fish but only the largemouth and sunfish reproduced successfully. If it were up to me I would stick with those fish as they seem to be to replenish their populations naturally."
