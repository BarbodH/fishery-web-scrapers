426571,irishfield,2010-01-28 02:54:00,26272,Watch those cheap trailpasses..... some down here get one.. scan it and make many more..
426590,Dara,2010-01-28 03:51:00,3052,  Not the stickers I don't think...eh..anythings possible though
426591,irishfield,2010-01-28 03:55:00,26272,The OFSC Trail pass sticker !

427040,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-01-29 01:53:00,0,cool pics larson.  looks like a good place for a long track!!!!
427090,Eazy,2010-01-29 03:12:00,260,Nice sled Dr. Sal............Touring machines are the best bang for your buck!
425967,ohhenrygsr,2010-01-26 14:29:00,947,Congrats
425971,pike slayer,2010-01-26 14:43:00,1177,"it would be a pretty good race on the hard packed groom trail or out on the lake. put some powder, slush, bumps,etc and all you will see is a snow cloud! and again great machine for what you plan to use it for let me know if you wanna do some fishin!"
425973,troutologist,2010-01-26 14:56:00,951,"Well congrats buddy Im glad you got one that can get the family involved in icefishing. Don't be so quick to put down the power auger though, I was a skeptic myself but after using one for a while theres no comparison for mobility and covering water.  CT has them like 50% off at the end of the season.  Also let me know if you need a trail broken to a back lake"
426063,johnnyb,2010-01-26 20:13:00,3413,The Doctor is in!!   Nice sled...so jealous...just don't go running over any of your old snowshoe-ing friends on the way into those backlakes
426073,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-01-26 21:26:00,0,"that's the good thing about those backlakes, ski doos can't get to them because they don't have a trail!"
426076,pike slayer,2010-01-26 21:49:00,1177,haha ohhhh i could make a trail real quick into those backlakes but it would kinda illegal being that they are in the park haha!
426080,Dara,2010-01-26 21:56:00,3052,  you're gonna end up fat and lazy now....
426083,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-01-26 21:59:00,0, not all backlakes are in the park...
426084,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-01-26 22:00:00,0,  i was working on that long before i ever owned a sled!
426085,Paully,2010-01-26 22:06:00,712,Nice Ride!
426133,Greencoachdog,2010-01-26 23:51:00,8163,  Like father like son eh!
426165,ciceri,2010-01-27 01:38:00,535, It's not 1972 anymore.. Sled will be fine. And he will be able to start it no problem.
426194,Dara,2010-01-27 02:48:00,3052,  Right at about that age...yeah....he will grow out of it but for now......   he used to think his name was Gitwood
426262,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-01-27 06:06:00,0,  what if i just come up north of wawa instead?
426294,anders,2010-01-27 14:01:00,1168,then you have to pay the toll
426299,Fish Farmer,2010-01-27 14:31:00,2234,"Just give me a single Elan. When you get there, drill an old guy a couple extra holes. I'll be there in 15."
426419,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-01-27 20:55:00,0,nothing wrong with an elan!!!    http://vimeo.com/9026594
426425,Dabluz,2010-01-27 21:11:00,701,You are going to love your machine for cruising the trails.  Very comfortable.  Elans in good condition sell for quite a bit of money.
426520,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-01-28 01:19:00,0,she's fast folks!
426522,Dara,2010-01-28 01:21:00,3052,  great...another throttle jockey out on the trails  wanna buy a permit cheap...I never stuck mine on yet  PS...the boys in Blue are gonna be all over you this weekend...keeping the trails safe
426544,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-01-28 02:01:00,0,  how much?
426548,troutologist,2010-01-28 02:07:00,951,haha luc...have fun trail riding buy the trail permit and leave your icefishing stuff at home sally.   funny thing about having icefishing gear is you dont need a permit. Sell your boat and buy a seadoo if all you want to do is burn gas.
426552,DRIFTER_016,2010-01-28 02:13:00,10439,  It's not a Yamaha.
426554,Dara,2010-01-28 02:14:00,3052,  sorry..I couldn't be responsible for corrupting you like that   I'll stick it on yet.  I don't ride here much but later in the year i like to be able to rip back and forth between McNabb st and the Zone Sunday afternoons...airing things out so to speak.  PS heading to Grand Marais Mi Saturday for a week of riding...should get better than a thousand miles in.
426562,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-01-28 02:30:00,0,  a trail pass went for 100 bucks on sootday the other day.  most of them are listed at 200. it's not worth it for me at 200 bucks given that we're a month in.
425848,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-01-26 01:48:00,0,I'm pretty excited! Here she is boys! I bought the 700cc in the silver colour. Cheers!    http://www.ski-doo.com/SkiDooPublic/_Stati.../GT_2002_GS.pdf
425860,charlied,2010-01-26 02:19:00,584,"With all the rain, you should have got a Jetski"
425878,trapshooter,2010-01-26 03:01:00,1234,"Nice.  I have the exact same sled in the 600cc.  Same year, same colour and everything.  You'll love it.  The 600 has lots of power so I can bet the 700 will really get up and go."
425880,pike slayer,2010-01-26 03:10:00,1177,"NICE!! not my style but NICE! good choice on getting the higher cc liquid cooled motor! forget all those slow elmer fudd fan cooled sleds! those 700s are known to be bullet proof motors and everyone was upset they stopped making them. give some more details on the sled, miles, price, etc. ohhh now you can go fishing with the real men"
425882,Dara,2010-01-26 03:22:00,3052,nice one...gonna get a trail permit?
425885,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-01-26 03:35:00,0,  900 miles (whatever km's that is)... paid 4.  fishing with real men?  right buddy! i heard you just liked the sled because of how the vibrations felt on your...
425886,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-01-26 03:36:00,0,"  not sure.  i'm not really big on trail riding, i purchased it more to fish all the stocked lakes closer town, and to access my camp in winter with my wife and son."
425887,Dara,2010-01-26 03:40:00,3052,Next thing you know you are going to have a power auger and chain saw in your kit
425889,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-01-26 03:57:00,0,"no power auger for me.  i had a son for that very purpose.  i will itemize every hole i drill for the little guy, and when he hits puberty, he can return the favour!"
425892,trapshooter,2010-01-26 04:01:00,1234,Did u buy it in the states?
425893,Dara,2010-01-26 04:03:00,3052,  g'luk with that plan...I have a 20 yo and it doesn't work
425895,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-01-26 04:07:00,0,LOL!  CRACK THE WHIP DARA!
425897,pike slayer,2010-01-26 04:18:00,1177,"i itemize every hole i drill just buggin' ya dr. but really, you think you can handle the 700??"
425900,Dabluz,2010-01-26 04:26:00,701,"I hope you like your machine.  It wouldn't be my choice either.  Great for 2 up riding on trails but other than that.....don't go into snow over 12 inches, never leave the trail and stay away form any kind of slush on the ice.  If you want to crank it when the battery is dead.....good luck.  Big motors may be fun but are crap to crank when it's cold.  Even the old 540 cc often took 2 people to pull the crank.  Store an extra battery and booster cables.  Is the heat exchanger under the seat?  I also hated machines that had that....you end up with a wet rear end and accumulated ice between the tunnel and the track."
425903,Dara,2010-01-26 04:36:00,3052,"A 700 with a 1 1/4"" lug track kicks butt in the slush..pin it and hang on"
425910,pike slayer,2010-01-26 05:00:00,1177,"not as fun as a 700 with a 2"" paddle"
425915,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-01-26 06:45:00,0,  to be honest it's more speed than i need but it's nice to know that power is there when i need it.  scared my old man RAVE sled will give your sled a run for it's money?
425922,Radnine,2010-01-26 10:20:00,1538,I am looking forward with great anticipation to the snowmobile rant thread. Congrats and enjoy your new purchase safely. Jim
425953,trapshooter,2010-01-26 13:30:00,1234," From my experience this isn't true.  Like I said, I have the same machine with the 600cc motor.  1. snow over 12""... come on! 2. Slush on the lake... I power through slush on the ice.  Put it to the bar and ride out of the slush every time!  I've been stopped in bad slush (to fish) and powered right out of it. 3. I can easily hand pull my machine in -20.  Can't imagine it's THAT much harder with 100 more cc's.  Cables and extra battery aren't a bad idea though, just to be safe. 4. heat exchanger is under the seat.  You will not end up with a wet rear end but you will accumulate ice between the tunnel and the track.  Your sled is an awesome ice fishing machine for 2 ppl.  Will tow a loaded toboggan no problem and get you where you need to go."
425958,cityfisher,2010-01-26 13:55:00,959, great price...!! now you need snow... I also just bough a sled and hardly any snow within 2 hours of my place
425959,asdve23rveavwa,2010-01-26 14:01:00,2690,"Nice, hopefully you have more snow up there so you can actually use it!  Enjoy the ice fishing up in the northland!"
425960,anders,2010-01-26 14:03:00,1168,atta boy...  now you can stay south of Montreal River
425963,Dara,2010-01-26 14:18:00,3052,  no such thing
425965,lew,2010-01-26 14:22:00,12766,"I remember the days when a 440 was considered a big powerful machine, now guys are saying a 700 is too small  Progress I spose........."
425966,John the Fisherman,2010-01-26 14:23:00,45,"Hey Doc.  I will give you some advice on Ski-Doo sleds with Raves.  If it is cold, like -20 or lower, you have to let Ski-Doo's warm up for a few minutes before you jump on them and pin it.  They have a reputation of blowing pistons if they are not warmed up enough.  Found out from experience and the mechanics advice. Be sure to run a good oil.  Synthetic is more money, but it is better. I have a 700 SKS now, and I have no problem pulling it over when very cold.  You should pull it over just a bit to loosen things up.  Even half a pull is good.  It just takes some strain off the battery from the start. Happy trails.  JTF"
