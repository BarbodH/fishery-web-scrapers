425731,Gerritt,2010-01-25 20:33:00,6129,Watch the video and read the article here...  http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2010/01/25/...pie-100125.html   G.
425732,BITEME,2010-01-25 20:36:00,1968,Its to bad it was from those that shant be named Would have been better from one of the battered inshore fishermen down home
425735,JohnF,2010-01-25 20:41:00,3494, That same P3TA freak will probably complain about how disrespectful the kids of today are.  A better ending to that video would have been watching the tree hugger get taken down by a 250 pound security guard who was having a bad day.  JF
425738,Dara,2010-01-25 20:45:00,3052,As said...almost any politician deserves it nowadays...just not by that group
425739,DRIFTER_016,2010-01-25 20:50:00,10439,  I would like to see mcguinty hit with a pie machine gun!!!!
425809,danbouck,2010-01-25 23:41:00,4380,"Didn't anybody say to her on the way in ""Hey, what's the pie for"""
425832,anonymous,2010-01-26 00:52:00,58,I'd like to see her sit in a jail for five years to ponder if doing p3ta's dirty work is really worth it.
425836,hammercarp,2010-01-26 01:14:00,964,I guess we will have tighten up our borders to keep those terrorists from the states crossing into Canada.
425845,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-01-26 01:45:00,0,"i thought this was hilarious until i heard it was about the seal hunt.  here's a neat documentary on the right coasters who seal hunt.  it's a nice, impartial look and the people behind the hunt instead of all the stupid Paul McCartney hypocrisies!  http://films.nfb.ca/ancestors/  If you want to find a real evil, look at how some factory farms are run.  Harvesting an animal from the wild is far more humane that the farm your McDonald's come from, yet people get sucked in because seals are cute.  P3TA sure hasn't come after me for killing lamprey!!!!"
425858,mbosh1980,2010-01-26 02:17:00,349,might be a silly question... why does everyone always spell the name of that group with a 3?
425859,irishfield,2010-01-26 02:19:00,26272,So google searches for the correct spelling don't bring them here...
425861,JohnF,2010-01-26 02:24:00,3494, Cuz they've been obnoxious enuf to finally be officially recognized as a dirty word and the cussbot has to change it.  JF
425864,mbosh1980,2010-01-26 02:31:00,349,"good to know, thanks."
425909,xeon,2010-01-26 04:58:00,350," In their ""greater plan"" they technically should be bombarding FOC. However, their group is full of all-talk hypocrites (except a few crazies) who worry about some seal 3000 miles north of them, or some person hunting a deer to feed his family, or even someone who owns a pet (therefore 99% of their group is full of hypocrites right there)."
425912,Dabluz,2010-01-26 05:22:00,701,Well....the sealing industry got a recent boost when China said that they wouldn't mind buying seal products from Canada.
425916,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-01-26 06:46:00,0,thats excellent news.
425933,mbac31,2010-01-26 12:13:00,904,I grew up doing this. Sealing is a right as well as a way to make a living. I have yet to see a seal wasted. White Coat killed or a seal hit with a club and panched alive. These people tick me off. One idiotic group of sealers blew it all out of proportion when they did panch them alive. That group should have been charged and beaten themselves.

427372,irishfield,2010-01-29 23:42:00,26272,Now if two women have a pie in their face....  .. are we even or at odds with each other.
427379,boatman,2010-01-30 00:11:00,350,"I don't think it should matter why the minister got a pie in the face. The fact is she is a high profile public figure and no one should be able to ""pie"" her. I was incredibly angered by the fact that it happened regardless of the reason. What's worse, is that the CCIW is a security building (I've been there) and you can't get in unless you work there or are invited and signed in by someone working there. This women is an American working or studying at McMaster University and was invited to the affair. I'm disgusted by all involved and angered that a representative of our government was assaulted. This isn't an asault on one person its an assault on Canada."
427387,mbosh1980,2010-01-30 00:34:00,349, meh turnaround is fair play. i think its doubly funny that a mascot pied a mascot
