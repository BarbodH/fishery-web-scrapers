427415,DMASSE,2010-01-30 02:15:00,420,"Hello  So I posted WHO WOULD LIKE TO GO ICE FISHING and Mark AKA BUICK14 posted lets go....   So 8am off we go to Cooks Bay for some perch action..    Arrive to find that there isnt alot of people fishing where we were.  So I check the Navionics for the IPHONE and off we go looking for 23- 27 ft of water...  When we set up the hut and started fishing Mark pulled out his AQUA VIEW (very cool by the way) and I pull out my sonar and we start catching fish right way..  The action was hot and steady with breaks of about 10-20 minutes between schools of fish.. Half way though the day A CO stops by to check for licenses and off he went...Good to see them on the ice,  I dont mind being checked..  Here are some pics for the day,  the last pick is 30 good size fish  for the table with over 50 released and probally another 50+ missed..       OUR BOUNTY   INSIDE AND OUT OF OUR FORTRESS    Thanks again to BUICK14 (mark) for a great day and I look forward in fishing again soon  Dave"

I tell you, pictures don't do justice...there were some nice fish, and you can agree; those perch were biting real soft today....walleye-like short strikes for sure... Without that aqua vu, I wouldnt have had half those fish  We did better than the guy beside us for sure lol"
