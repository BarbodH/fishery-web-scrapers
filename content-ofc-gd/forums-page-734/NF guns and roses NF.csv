426400,BUSTER,2010-01-27 19:54:00,1336,I was wondering if any OFC members are going?  thursday night in toronto.........
426403,pike slayer,2010-01-27 20:08:00,1177,this is a fishing only site
426408,blaque,2010-01-27 20:21:00,2419,"Not going, but out of curiosity ..........who is Guns and Roses these days? Is Axl fronting? Arent Slash and Duff now known as velvet revolver? Sorry.....i lost touch with all this band swapping over the last couple years.  Chris Cornell went from soundgarden frontman to Audioslave, who used to be Rage against the machine......Audioslave is now gone again and Cornell is solo...  Dave grohl of the Foo Fighters (formerly Nirvana) is playing drums for Queens of the stoneage....then back to Foo Fighters, and wait a minute, now hes got another band called Those Crooked Vultures.  Corey taylor goes back and forth between Slipknot and his original band StonedSour.  My head spins sometimes"
426606,Lunatic,2010-01-28 04:21:00,536,"I went to the hamilton axl rose show and it was great. anyone who is a fan of the band but passed on this because slash,duff and izzy etc are no longer in the band really missed out. he played a lot of classics and it sounded great, 29 song set list. plus sabastian bach played alot of skid row songs. good deal,well worth the money....beer was 9.25 tho, that sucked"
426613,Dutchy,2010-01-28 04:49:00,416," I'll go the other way on this, I saw them in London and thought they were absolutely awful. Axl cannot sing anymore and moves around like he has arthritis. And for sure there was a backing track for Axl. The band while very competent are simply session musicians (yeah I know Tommy Stinson was in the Replacements). GNR seem very irrelevant now. The new songs apart from the song Chinese Democracy are abysmal and they played way too much from that album. Just my opinion though"
426634,Lunatic,2010-01-28 06:34:00,536,"Yeah,i dont care for the new album either. but it was nice to hear some of the old stuff. the sound and his movement were all in good forum in the hammer"
426657,BUSTER,2010-01-28 12:04:00,1336,"I was in hamilton  on the floor and it was awsome, sound was great and axl's singing was just fine, sometimes he was better than 1986,, i seen them also in london ontario but in 2005 with buckethead on guitar and that show sucked, but hamilton rocked and iam going to toronto tonight floor tickets again should be a good show."
426675,cityfisher,2010-01-28 13:33:00,959,ill be there tonight...should be interesting. .. there last show i saw at the ACC was OK at best.. he didnt sound great that forsure
426836,jediangler,2010-01-28 20:22:00,1923,"I saw them open up for ""The Cult"" in Waterloo when they were touring for ""Appetite"". They were so bad they were booed offstage 3 songs into their set. 6 months later they were bigger than ""The Cult"". I don't get it. I guess videos are more influential than actual talent."
426964,irishfield,2010-01-28 23:50:00,26272,Brad... I thought you were more of a Shania kinda guy !!
427054,landry,2010-01-29 02:10:00,1005,"it was the worst show ever. he played mostly his new junk. And the sound was terrible - you could hardly hera the vocals. He went backstage at least 20 times to do god knows what while they played rambling nonsensical solos to fill time. I love GnR, was 30 feet from stage and would compare it to going on a timeshare weekend. I just felt like I was waiting for the one hour sales pitch to be over so I could get to the good stuu/music."
