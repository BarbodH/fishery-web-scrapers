427260,Bob,2010-01-29 16:45:00,370,"If your temps are anything like ours up here,  that snow should be light and fluffy enough to handle with the big leaf-blower, Wayne. At least, I would think so."

427283,fishnsled,2010-01-29 18:11:00,3520,On the Beaverton side of the lake there was 3-4 inches last night in my Dad's driveway.  Better then nothing at all.  Haven't heard about the westside as of yet.
427288,fishnsled,2010-01-29 18:29:00,3520,About 8-10cm in Keswick last night as well.  Should be OK.
427328,Greencoachdog,2010-01-29 21:08:00,8163,"Snow???... that must be terrible!!!  It's sunny, 72*, and the winds are light and variable down here in 'Bama!  Our water temps are up to 50*    ... and the turtles are starting to come up out of the mud!    Daffodils are starting to come up in the gardens!  Spring is right around the corner folks!!!"
427330,Spiel,2010-01-29 21:15:00,9065, There'll be no talk of spring here till I've at least had one opportunity to get on the ice this season.
