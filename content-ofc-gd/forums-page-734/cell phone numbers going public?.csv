427512,waterwolf,2010-01-30 06:49:00,556,just received an email stating that cell phone numbers  will be now available to the masses . can anyone dismiss this or is this nightmare actually a possibility?  crank calls from even more venders {while i'm paying }makes me ill just thinking about it!!
427526,bigugli,2010-01-30 12:25:00,6138,"They already were publicly accessible. Any number exchange is just a block of 10,000 numbers in sequence. Once activated it is listed."
427545,cranks bait,2010-01-30 14:01:00,721,I've been getting telemarketers on my cell for about six months now.  At least most of them come up as 000000000 numbers or such so I just ignore them.
427552,dave524,2010-01-30 14:19:00,4508,"I could see that the option to have your number made public, that is listed in the phone book and available on 411 should be made possible. A few people I know dropped their land line based phones completely and rely totally on cells now."
427559,Big Cliff,2010-01-30 14:40:00,6899,"You can have your cell phone number put on the ""do not call list"" it won't stop all of them but it really cuts down on the un wanted calls."
427659,bubbles,2010-01-30 18:36:00,591,"Yep, started getting the calls about 4 months ago."
427662,SBCregal,2010-01-30 18:41:00,688,"when i first picked up my cell phone i got alot of text and voice msgs.  turns out it was my provider (FIDO) sending all of them,  once i requested that they stop sending them i didnt get any more calls/msgs"

""This is your captain speaking"".. thought what the hell.. is my brother playing a prank.. and then that dreaded Ship Horn blew....    Real nice on my nickle!!"
