427125,muskymike,2010-01-29 05:02:00,772,"Lew, some points to consider:  They both have maintenance issues and strength issues. This is more of a comparison so you can weigh in on the differences.  First off, strength is not an issue, if you manage to break off a piece of either, you are doing something you shouldnt be doing in your kitchen. That being said, if you break Granite, you are outta luck. If you break Quartz, it can be repaired, they can for a price, fix any broken piece.  Granite will stain. If you spill wine, mustard or any other substance that will stain and leave it, it will be absorbed into the veining and it is very very very hard to get out. Quartz will not stain due to the finish on the surface, but there have been cases where it does end up staining (the epoxy stains)  You can put any hot object directly on Granite with no ill effect. If you place a hot pot on Quartz, the epoxy can and will heat up and cause discoloration and an uneven finish.  Granite does need to be sealed, but Olive oil will do the trick, all you have to do is rub it on (they dont tell you that because they want to sell the products they carry)  ALL manufactures of Quartz (Silestone, hanstone, ceasarstone) are the EXACT same product. They all come from the same distributors. The one in Canada is out of Montreal. Dont let someone tell you that one product is better than the other, they are identical. If you dont believe me, find an honest Granite supplier and they will give you that knowledge. If you want, PM me and I will tell you the company that distributes and manufactures it.  Consider sizing in your kitchen (Quartz usually comes in larger slabs). Both slabs are manufactured for specific max sizes. If you have an oversized island, you may have seams. Make sure if you have a joint in your counter (ie corners) they dont just put a standard Mitre joint or butt joint. Make sure they use a birds mouth into a mitre. you will get a much tighter seam.  Cutting on either surface can cause chips or scratches. The Natural fissures in granite make small chips less evident where as Quartz tends to show more. Solution, use a cutting board. Many people will say one or the other wont scratch or chip. They are wrong. You shoudlnt cut on either.  You will pay a premium for certain colors of Granite. Usually suppliers group them into levels or groups. There should not be more than 3 Levels in the worst case scenario. Companies like Home Depot usually have 5 levels. Its a money grab. Granite colors in higher  groups are usually Black Galaxy and Antique Brown. They group them by supply, demand, stock levels and world levels. Make sure you look at each surface in the lighting you have in your kitchen. Under the right lighting styles, these 2 and others look incredible. Ask to see them in different lighting scenes.  Corian is/was a nice product. It has become more of a Bathroom product recently with the price reduction in Stone surfaces. It does scratch a lot easier than both the stone products, but can be buffed out if damaged. Its more of a dated product now and the price point, even though lower than Granite or Quartz is still high for what the product offers. Also, Corian can be either polished or honed, both stone should be polished.  Other considerations can be Soapstone, Sandstone and Marble. All very soft and porous. All require slightly more maintenance.  It all comes down to preference, the price points of Granite and Quartz SHOULD be the same but 90% of retailers will sell Quartz at a higher price. They cost the same to the suppliers most of the time, depending on their buying power. Shop around to see who gives you the best price.  I do not work for a counter company but deal with solid surface companies every day both in Toronto and Ottawa. Granite and Quartz both have advantages and disadvantages. In the end go with what your eye tells you. Make sure you do a Slab view if possible as well.  PM me and I can give you a few names of larger suppliers in the GTA that should be able to provide a price. Dont let the increase in price get the best of you from Granite to Quartz. $70/SF is typical retail, you may be able to talk them down. Quartz at $95 is high.  Hopefully this helps out a little  Mike"
427143,lew,2010-01-29 08:50:00,12766,"Thanks for taking the time to post all that info Mike, it gives me lots more to think about.  Sheeesh, and here I thought picking out the counters was gonna be an easy task"
427162,aplumma,2010-01-29 12:15:00,6896,Hey Lew  As you know I am a plumber so I install quite a few countertops and get to see them a few years later as I visit the houses for other plumbing issues. I am not against natural stones but I have found if you can find a pattern you like in the solid Dupont materials then they have my vote hands down. The weight of the natural stones sometimes means the cabinets need to be reinforced (not a big deal but something to ask the installer about). Islands that have overhangs so you can put a chair under are not well supported and will find any pressure cracks in natural stone. The corners on stone unless rounded are tough on the hips when you run into them. While Corian is not any softer the ability to work an edge is easier and cheaper. The seams are the weakest point in naturals and are dictated by the size of the stone but also the weight of the stone so you will have more exposed joints in the project. The solid surfaces Dupont use the same resin they are made of to make the joints so you have no visible lines and they are as strong as the top. Any of your average damage that is done with a knife cut or other can usually be sanded/buffed out the damage to stone is permanent unless you have it professionally buffed out. The ability of naturals and Corian to resist damage is greater than the effort it takes to damage the laminate tops.  Hope this all helps and good luck on your choices.   Art

426676,lew,2010-01-28 13:35:00,12766,"Question for those of you with either granite or quartz countertops.  After we move into the new house in a few weeks were gonna replace all the countertops but I'm undecided on which to go with as I've heard good things about both and would like to hear from those of you with either.  Granite is extremely popular and was my 1st choice, but I've heard that it's not as stain resistant as quartz and has to be sealed once in awhile, but I don't see how that could be a big job.  Quartz on the other hand is much harder and less pourous so will not stain, but sounds like it's quite a bit more $$$$  I've only actually talked to one countertop company (in Peterboro) who deals in both products and they say it's basically a personal choice and doesn't really recommend one over the other.  If I remember correctly, the granite is gonna be about $70 a sq. ft installed and the quartz will be about $90 installed.  It's a big kitchen and we're gonna have about 30' of counter, plus a 5' center island so it's gonna be very expensive which ever way I go, but I don't mind paying extra for the quartz if it'll be that much better.  Any thoughts ??"
426684,mbac31,2010-01-28 13:51:00,904,"Hey Lew, Those are good choices. Granite tends to have a nicer pattern usually. Quartz is also very nice as well. Try looking at the sile Stone products to Lew. I have had all three in houses and they all need to be sealed usually. Its best to make sure any stone is properly sealed. Granite with chip easier then the Quartz and the Silestone. If I were in you rposition I would go with the Quartz. If you want call my wife, she is a Kitchen Designer and ask her opinion. She will tell you more about them and other types as well. 416-283-3166 Press 3 then Press 1 and ask for Michelle. She is off today but will be there tomorrw. Or I can ask her tonight when  I get home and let you know."
426698,Big Cliff,2010-01-28 14:20:00,6899,"I have never had either Lew but some friends did have a beautiful Granite counter top (until someone spilled a glass of red wine on it) it had been sealed but perhaps not properly or something but it did leave a stain. I'm not sure how, but they did get rid of the stain eventually but were paranoid about anything being put on the counter after that."
426704,backbay,2010-01-28 14:29:00,773,"Lew, when we did our kitchen, we went with granite as opposed to Zodiac (Dupont), partly because it was less money, but mostly because of the more natural look of the stone. The quartz is a completely uniform surface, and we found we liked the irregularity of granite more. It'll take a little work finding the stone you want and matching the sheets, but if you like doing that sort of thing, you might be happier in the long run. It's a matter of taste, and budget. As far as sealing is concerned, I can't  remember how long we went before re-sealing, but it was a number of years. Stains weren't a problem. Good luck!"
426707,tightline,2010-01-28 14:33:00,322,"Being a cabinetmaker for 12 years I've dealt with both but would have to say granite would be my preference...although it does stain a little easier (by the way both need sealing) it is a bit cheaper but there is a lot more vein and grain patten to it which I like...But there is another route have you considered corian?? Cheaper for sure will outlast both in the maintenance and has countless patterns available...you can get a stone pattern that looks just like granite in many colors....great look,high durability, lower cost...heres a pretty cool design link I found check it out if you like...  http://www2.dupont.com/Surfaces/en_US/prod...rian/index.html  click on the design my kitchen link on bottom right of page"
426714,crappieperchhunter,2010-01-28 14:45:00,2582," I have no experience with any of this Lew. I still have the same counter tops that the builder installed when my house was built in 89.  But I can tell you this. My sister-in-law has had quartz and granite and has went to Corian, and believe me money is no object for her cause there loaded. They liked the excellent color choices it offered and are happier with it's performance compared to the other 2. They entertain a lot and like Cliff mentioned above... have had more then one red wine stain to deal with on the quartz and granite."
426764,Squid,2010-01-28 17:07:00,1656,"Quartz is stronger, less maintenance and you can cut right on it without worries of scratching the surface."
426765,Squid,2010-01-28 17:08:00,1656,quartz does not need to be resurfaced every four years
426771,Bill Shearer,2010-01-28 17:24:00,456,"Seams if required are visible with granite, but not with quartz, or solid surface. Solid surface is easily repaired if burnt or gouged. They can acually cut a piece out and replace with a piece that was cutout for the sink. Not so with granite. I have granite at my place, and solid surface in the bathrooms. Both are lovely, it just depends on what you like the looks of."

426987,Dutch,2010-01-29 00:47:00,831,"Hey Lew.  If you are going with granite, I highly, highly reccommend Delray Granite, they are just outside Lakefield, about halfway to Bridgenorth on the south side of the highway.  We had out counters done last November and they look great.  They deal with a number of suppliers/distributors and you can pick out your slabs in toronto and have them shipped up.  They deal with 3 c.m product, vs. 3/4 inch, which looks so much better in my opinion.  They do all computerized measurements and templating.  It was more expensive than going with a Toronto installer, but I don't mind supporting a local business.  We actually had a T. installer come measure because the price was right.  When they showed up with a tape measure and no other way to template, I was skeptical.  When I asked how they would get it to fit tight to the wall, they said they would just fill the gap in with silicone.....buh bye, I said.  Anyway, we went with Delray and were more than happy.  We did the same research you did and went with granite.  I is really amazing with the totally natural patterns, each slab has character."
427018,lew,2010-01-29 01:06:00,12766," That's funny Dutch, I travel that road all the time and never knew there was a granite dealer there, but I guess we don't see things we're not looking for. Anyways, that's only a couple miles from my trailer and about 15 miles from the new house so I'll definetely get in touch with him and see what he's got to say.  Thanks again everyone !!"

427060,Muskieman,2010-01-29 02:31:00,2472,Re: Granite...  Apparently ... seen it on TLC... that granite countertops MAY contain Radon which is a carcinogen ...some countertops have been tested to have Radon emissions equivalent to 2 1/2 packs of smokes a day.. The recommendation was to have a Geigercounter available when purchasing a Granite countertop.. anything below .x?ppm of radiation is acceptable..

427065,Dara,2010-01-29 02:39:00,3052,"I did my kitchen 2 years ago and went with solid surface. Same as Corian but a different brand. The main reason is because its softer than stone. When you set a wine glass on granite, you have to set it down easy...and so do the kids with a glass. When you set it on the Corian, you don't need to think about it. I plan on building a house this summer and will do the same again."
