As you can see in the following photos it has been overcast and quite cool...      We are trying to ignore the bad weather and make the best of it, until Spring arrives in a couple of weeks.

427524,HTHM,2010-01-30 12:12:00,4082,"Garry, picture this in your mind's eye. A single hand at the end of a fully extended arm, in a closed fist with one finger, extended skyward. I hope you get a sunburn....."
427573,Leecher,2010-01-30 15:14:00,7832,You just had to rub it in eh I hope your lake freezes over next time you go out
427599,Fang,2010-01-30 16:19:00,1330,"I've seen a few of your pics and gotta ask. Is that a Fisher aluminum bass boat. I had a Grey Thunder version for a few years and loads of great memories in it. Looks like the same carpet, rod locker and disctint gunnel around the front deck  Enjoy the warm weather. It was a balmy -15C yesterday with about 30km winds when I was gassing up the truck in Bolton. No gloves and only a light jacket for work."
427600,TJQ,2010-01-30 16:21:00,7806,It is so unfortunate that you have to suffer... I feel bad for you.. its was a balmy -25 here yesterday morning...
427601,tibbs,2010-01-30 16:23:00,650,Great Pics Garry!  Looks like your suffering.
427620,Garry2Rs,2010-01-30 17:01:00,1425,"Thanks guys, I was hoping to give you a laugh. Fear not! Spring will come again and we will all get out on soft water. Albert: Good One! I can picture that...HAHAHA. Fang: My boat is a late 80's 350V Ranger.  It's old but it's a great ride.  I extended the decks and created storage lockers under them a couple of years ago. "
427631,JohnF,2010-01-30 17:25:00,3494, It really is. Fast enuf to get a little air off a wake too. My favourite flavour of bass fishing. Kinda like fishing off a low dock except the dock takes you to the fish.  Looks like you blew a thumb on yer glove. Remind me to bring some more up in the spring.  JF
427660,fishing n autograph,2010-01-30 18:40:00,2540,wow....you're out on that water without a floater suit? Now that's brave!
427741,Garry2Rs,2010-01-30 23:33:00,1425,That was the Pike opener last May. You know Spring time in Ontario. When you can peal-off down to a down filled ski Jacket...Hahaha. I do have a vest on...
