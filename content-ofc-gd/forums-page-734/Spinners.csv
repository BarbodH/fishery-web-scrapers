427072,BillM,2010-01-29 02:48:00,17367,Panther Martins...
427077,hammercarp,2010-01-29 02:51:00,964,Mepps
427083,Spiel,2010-01-29 02:56:00,9065,"Panther Martins, been working for me for over 30 plus years."
427087,fishhunter,2010-01-29 03:07:00,604,"Both, but I take the treble off and run a single hook. Less damage to the fish"
427088,Eazy,2010-01-29 03:07:00,260,"Hey, Hey , wait a minute.............you forgot to add the super vibrax to this thread!............Killers for Coho and Steelhead!"
427089,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-01-29 03:10:00,0,the mepps black fury #3.
427093,Eazy,2010-01-29 03:20:00,260,"For speckies tho, I prefer a smaller Hildebrant with a snell hook and worm, seem to get more that way when they're finicky!"
427098,MuskyGreenHorn,2010-01-29 03:30:00,158,Both have their time and place really.  What about the worden's rooster tail?
427104,asdve23rveavwa,2010-01-29 03:38:00,2690,"I'm with Eazy, another vote for the Blue Fox vibrax...#4 Fire Tiger, awesome for Bows and Ho's!!!!!"
427105,danc,2010-01-29 03:38:00,4677,"I haven't used a spinner in a long time, but I preferred a Mepps Aglia when I did use them. The wide blade of an Aglia compared to the willow leaf of a panther martin made for a much slower retrieve, which proved beneficial to me. I target bigger fish these days and find crank baits or jigs easier and more effective to use. Jigs especially. If you're targeting smaller Trout in a creek, give a Rapala Countdown size 3 a try. I've caught numerous Trout on a CD 3."
427133,Stern Rules,2010-01-29 05:28:00,342,I like Mepps as I rarely use my Panther Martin. I must start this year.
427137,redneck666,2010-01-29 05:34:00,563,"i stick to mepps, have never used panther martins and vibrax only used once with good results. i stick more towards just a plain worm hook and sinker with a little spiner that you can attach a hook to, not sure what their called, their more of a spinner bait style spinner except smaller and plain chrome or whatever it is. they work great for me cause i usually only creek fish for specks and i get great catches that way! only  a few select people in town know about my pools!"
427185,bigugli,2010-01-29 13:29:00,6138,Have to admit I've always been partial to the Black Fury.
427201,Mike Pike,2010-01-29 14:10:00,1332,"For brookie fishing down this part of Southern Ontario, I use both but find myself flipping and casting the Mepps a bit more oftern.  With our fish being smaller than what you'd find up your way, I use the smaller size spinners and find the heavier weight of the Mepps makes 'em easier to throw."
427224,gil,2010-01-29 14:38:00,41,1/32 oz. with black blade and feathers has always been a killer for me ! Love them Specks  Gil
427229,justin elia,2010-01-29 15:01:00,151,"Panther Martin: silver blade, yellow body, red spots.  Killer!"
427231,anders,2010-01-29 15:09:00,1168,I'll take ol Lucky Strike!
427321,Spiel,2010-01-29 20:35:00,9065,  That's the one.
427325,The Birdfish,2010-01-29 21:01:00,73,"Mepps all the way, earlier this year while on a trip with 2 boats out and the only thing catching was a gold Mepps for a whole week.  I know problably condition related but sold me."
427334,I'mHooked,2010-01-29 21:21:00,525,"Mepps, Trophy Trout series #3, as per this Brown who liked it. Liked it so much was hit 2 years in a row in the same spot same time of year.    It's my lucky spinner!"
427343,trevy727,2010-01-29 21:39:00,351,mepps over panther martin for me. But i use husky jerks and chartuese blue fox's more than the others for bigger brookies. Aglias with a stinger hook and worm as well.
427366,gbaysteel,2010-01-29 23:08:00,13,both are awesome but for brookies i love double loon spinners
427401,smitter,2010-01-30 01:41:00,106,"Mepps Black Fury with a half worm, catches anything that swims."
427405,CLofchik,2010-01-30 01:54:00,854,"Panther Martin's in creeks & rivers, they seem to spin & swing easier.  Definitely has to be silver blade, yellow body, red dots.  They make others?  Mepps Aglia for lakes.  Black Fury when I'm feeling particulary contrary that day."
