426923,smitter,2010-01-28 22:41:00,106,"Those are amazing!  I know just where to use them.  Late April to early May in the St. Mary's rapids, drifted along bottom and BOOM!"
426946,packrat,2010-01-28 23:14:00,93,Those are simply fantastic   Never seen artificials tied that look so real----you have a real talent for the smallest detail in your work/craft
426950,Roy,2010-01-28 23:21:00,13728,You know of course that the more you guys compliment him the more I'll be paying for my dahlbergs. Have a heart will ya?
426956,ohhenrygsr,2010-01-28 23:38:00,947,That's freakin awesome.
427025,Spiel,2010-01-29 01:26:00,9065,"Thanks guys and Joey.  I'd like to tell you it's a labour of love but I'd be lying, it's just labour.  I'll respond to a few of the comments in order to keep it somewhat brief.... For those that I didn't quote your comments are truly appreciated, thanks again.   Good job your head wasn't in the way.    Patience and boredom which is compounded by spending the time tying them.    Got a spare bedroom?    When I'm done with him I hope to do a few for myself.    Simple Minds.    SHUTUP!  Bigger ones coming.    Yep, bout an hour each Aaron.    What lake is that?    I can do that!    I told you Roy, to late!!!!!!!!!!!"
426564,Spiel,2010-01-28 02:44:00,9065,"Okay I was gonna hold off on posting anymore but I just finished these two and had to share.  I think they may be the most realistic flies I've tied to date. Made some changes from the last Brown Stonefly and added in the antennae, a bead head and some brown peacock herl in the thorax to simulate the gills.  I'm thinking the trout, any trout would love 'em.    For size reference the bodies are about 7/8ths of an inch long."

No different than the undr water camera I recently bought... first time down a hole and what do I see??? A big ol muskie eyeing it up for food! It would have been worth loosing the camera to see it happen!  PS: I think you out did yourself on those 2 Chris.... now back to those 3 inchers I was talking about....
