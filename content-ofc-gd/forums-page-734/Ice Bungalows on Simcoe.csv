But I wouldn't mind getting a few buddies together and renting an ice bungalow for the weekend somewhere on Simcoe.  I am not looking for an outfitter that can rent out one of their ""regular"" huts for a weekend.  I heard Floyd Hale does, but I couldn't find anything on their site.  I'm looking for a true bungalow that we can sleep, cook, eat, and down a couple of wobbly pops without being crowded in.  So if any one can recommend one it would be great.  Thanks"
427282,Spiel,2010-01-29 18:11:00,9065,To the best of my knowledge Floyd Hales is the only one on Simcoe offering ice bungalows. According to their ad in my lastest OOD his bungalows sleep 4.  You can verify this at his toll free number.... #1-800-363-4704
