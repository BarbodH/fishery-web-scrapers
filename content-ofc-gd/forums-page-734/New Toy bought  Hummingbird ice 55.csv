426561,T Fisher,2010-01-28 02:29:00,139,"Gonna give it a go this weekend, is there anything I should know ahead of time or is it as simple to use as my FL18.  It has alot more buttons then my Vexilar.  Wow 2400 watts."
426578,Sebastian,2010-01-28 03:12:00,208,"You're gonna spit on vexilar after the weekend.  Drop it in, play with your gain(up), noise rejection down, pick which beam and watch the magic."
426598,FisherMike,2010-01-28 04:07:00,108,dont use the support cable for the transducer.  its useless and can cause the ducer to hang uneven.
426599,jdmls,2010-01-28 04:10:00,575,"post a report after you use it , please and Thank you .. I am in the works of trying to pick one up ... Where'd you buy it ? best price I have found is $480 @ radioworld ..."
426786,xeon,2010-01-28 18:13:00,350, Check the states too.
426797,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-01-28 18:31:00,0,i use a 45.  it's great. very user friendly.
426815,jayess,2010-01-28 19:05:00,187," If you come across a retailer with good shipping, let me know... most that i've find that are willing to ship to Canada choose UPS which in my experience always tacks on brokerage fees (even for items that aren't charged duties), that brings the price to about on-par with local retailers"
426816,anders,2010-01-28 19:15:00,1168,Im interested too....a report on it would be awsome..thanks
426920,kgeary,2010-01-28 22:38:00,82,me too would like to know if you prefer the humminbird over the vexilar kg
427038,T Fisher,2010-01-29 01:51:00,139,"I bought mine @ La baron, being a member I saved 20%? $569.00 that is the best price I found even the US. If you take in consideration of all the fees and exchange rate $ 569.00 + or - a few dollars no waiting. Radio world is out of stock and not getting more. They do have the ice 45 in stock.  I will put it to the test this weekend first Simcoe deep water for lakers and on Sunday Walleye in Quintie.  I will report on this new toy Sunday night."
427062,DRIFTER_016,2010-01-29 02:34:00,10439,  Check Reeds sporting goods. I bought a Marcum LX-5 last spring and they used Fedex and I didn't get hosed.  Humming Bird Flashers are on sale too!!!!  The 55 is $419.99  Reeds Sporting Goods
