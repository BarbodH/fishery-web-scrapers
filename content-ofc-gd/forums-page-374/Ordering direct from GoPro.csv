I was wondering if anyone has bought direct from them and knows if they will ship any other way like USPS?

724332,Handlebarz,2012-08-22 12:00:00,3790,Dave that sounds like a good deal. I might have to look at that heck I can even stop off st Ed's bait to get some new tubes the wife still wants to go bass fishing.
