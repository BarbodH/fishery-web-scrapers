712664,lew,2012-07-08 10:18:00,12766,Be good to see you again Moe.
712907,Fish4Eyes,2012-07-09 13:09:00,1022,Enjoy your stay guys. I just returned from there last night after a 7 night stay. Pike and pickerel fishing was pretty good.
712908,Seaweed,2012-07-09 13:10:00,135,Roy I am arriving on Saturday August 4 and leaving on Thursday August 9.  I am up there on the week with the holiday Monday every year for the past 7 years anyway.  It only took me three years to find the fish.  Tough water sometimes...  BTW we will be under a fairly good full moon... hang on to the rods everyone.
714376,aplumma,2012-07-13 20:03:00,6896,O.K. it is official Joe and I will be up there 5th to the 10th of Aug. Mr Lew I do believe if you have time you owe me a muskie.  I seem to have drawn a blank the last time you were generous enough to take me out.   Art
714378,lew,2012-07-13 20:19:00,12766,"Great news Art, and yes, I certainly do have a spot for you.  Lookin forward to seeing the pair of youz again !!"
714413,aplumma,2012-07-13 22:46:00,6896,I forgot... what size gaff should I bring to land the muskies Lew?   Art
714417,Roy,2012-07-13 23:04:00,13728,"You don't need a gaff, Art. We have Capt. Hooked with us remember?  I'm really looking forward to seeing you boys again!"
714422,lew,2012-07-13 23:18:00,12766," It's easier to just grab them by the eye sockets Art, keeps em from squirming too much."
714423,Roy,2012-07-13 23:21:00,13728,"Don't do that Lew! If you squeeze their eyeballs, they start losing their teeth!"
714425,lew,2012-07-13 23:23:00,12766,I thought it was the warm water that made the teeth fall out ??
714426,aplumma,2012-07-13 23:34:00,6896,I guess we can do it either way after all we are just going to grind them up and make muskie burgers anyway.   Art
714433,woodenboater,2012-07-14 00:36:00,2277,"Bummer, my vacation ends that weekend when everyone else shows up. Is anyone going to be there the weekend before ?"
714440,Rich Clemens,2012-07-14 01:19:00,3131,Really don't understand all this wishful thinking about catching musky.    I already caught them.    Guess you'll have to settle for pike stew
714490,motv8tr,2012-07-14 13:52:00,2587,"Art, it will be good to see you and Joe, I'm looking forward to it.  Maureen"
715057,Roy,2012-07-16 20:56:00,13728,"Looks like there are a few more who'll be making an appearance. Mercy sakes alive, looks like we have us a convoy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
715058,lew,2012-07-16 20:58:00,12766,Good times are guaranteed Roy
715081,Tybo,2012-07-16 21:47:00,1373,There goes my nice quiet week at the lake.  Oh yeah. It`s never too quiet for long when I`m around.  :blahblah1:
715146,capt_hooked,2012-07-17 00:50:00,212,Just to get you guys excited......  I expect we'll see a couple nice muskies caught while you are here.....  One guy and his wife this past week raised 3 big fish (46-48 inches maybe?) and landed two smaller fish.. a 39- and a 44-incher. They were very happy.  Bass and walleye fishing is good...  Pike is a bit slow for some reason.. although I got asked to clean two nice fish..(25-28 inches) few days back... fried them up real fast and tasty .. for a nice couple from Georgia...   
715149,motv8tr,2012-07-17 01:06:00,2587,"Well according to Lew, those are not worthy Muskie   When I got mine a few years ago and it was estimated to be 44"" his only comment was ""I don't play with fish that small ""  I'll be happy to play with them anytime though....I'm not that picky  Maureen"
715224,lew,2012-07-17 07:47:00,12766," Their ALL worthy Mo, just some are MORE worthy than others   :lol:"
715322,Rich Clemens,2012-07-17 14:42:00,3131,Just don't catch my 50+ .... she's still out there somewhere.
715325,woodenboater,2012-07-17 14:47:00,2277,I'm heading up there tomorrow for a week so will keep an eye out for your musky Rich  Last trip up was just smb. Pike were slim pickings for me
715351,Rich Clemens,2012-07-17 15:56:00,3131,"  Now don't you go catching it ...  just PM me the coordinates where she is, since I won't be back up there until June of next year. I'll take care of business then.  Oh yeah - Best of luck on any other species you choose to fish for."
715462,woodenboater,2012-07-17 19:56:00,2277,That musky has nothing to worry about from me
724377,Seaweed,2012-08-22 17:27:00,135,Hi everyone My appologies for not coming over to say hi while up at the West Arm this year. I had a bunch of calamity events that took a lot of my time while up there this year and dodging the foul weather... well between those things there was little time for much socializing. I totalled my trailer trying to launch the Nitro at the Sucker Creek launch when I backed it off the concrete pad and decided that my truck would pull it out real well if I slapped it in four wheel low and hammered the gas... wrong...  bent the center rib and knoced off all the bunks what a bonehead move ... thanks to a few of the lads we managed to get my trailer fixed and the welding shop in Vernor is amazing and I would recommend them to anyone... thirty bucks to weld up some new welds that busted loose on the center rib. I did see lots of boats on the water when I did get out a few times but... well I was fishing... and not too successfully until Thursday when you could not keep the pike off the hook... amazing that the bite could turn on like that.  I hope you all had a good week and someday I will make it over to say hello and get to put some faces to a lot of folk on this discussion board. Tight lines and enjoy the rest of the summer.
711074,Roy,2012-07-03 10:42:00,13728,I haven't been to Lakair in two years and I miss showing up there at least once or twice a year. Well I finally found some time during the week of August 5th and this time J will be with me. I know that there'll be a few alumni there. It would be super if a few people showed up. I spoke to Kevin last week and there are cottages and camping available for that week. We'll be staying with Joey and Paul and I'm quite sure that Lew and Diane will be there. I'm really looking forward to this! I'll be there between the 6th and 10th.
711078,lew,2012-07-03 11:03:00,12766,Be good to see you and J again Roy  We'll be there August 4-18

711083,lew,2012-07-03 11:18:00,12766,"We'll have a great time as always Roy !!  We'll be in cabin 1-W, just across the road from you guys."
711084,Roy,2012-07-03 11:25:00,13728, Perfect! Coffee at the fire pit at 4am (maybe even at Lew o'clock) sounds good.
711086,Christopheraaron,2012-07-03 11:53:00,3525,Still not sure if I'll get up this year but I just noticed is that lew on their site?
711087,lew,2012-07-03 11:54:00,12766,"Coffee's always on by 4:00 AM Roy, see ya at the firepit !!"
711131,John,2012-07-03 14:41:00,2956,Sorry we will miss you Roy. We will be there from the 11th to the 18th...unfortunately can't change it at this stage.
711133,John,2012-07-03 14:43:00,2956," Yep he get's paid royalties,(all the coffee he can drink before 6am)........."
711139,Roy,2012-07-03 15:02:00,13728," Mine can't be changed either unfortunately, John. I'll catch up with you and Barb soon somehow."
711140,lew,2012-07-03 15:07:00,12766," Hey, I like that idea John"
711147,Rich Clemens,2012-07-03 15:34:00,3131,Not sure I left any muskies to be caught ... but good luck anyway.
711150,John,2012-07-03 15:40:00,2956,You certainly had them dialed in Rich....You deserve them the amount of time you guys spend on the water!
711159,Joey,2012-07-03 16:11:00,9122,Can't wait myself  But don't wake me at 4 a.m. for coffee or you're dead
711161,Christopheraaron,2012-07-03 16:13:00,3525, She's right wake her up at 3
711183,lew,2012-07-03 17:23:00,12766, You do know the day is 1/2 gone by 4:30 eh Joey ??
711187,Joey,2012-07-03 17:29:00,9122, Not in my world Lew
711217,Rich Clemens,2012-07-03 18:19:00,3131,Don't make me come up there  !!!!!
711260,John,2012-07-03 20:10:00,2956, Have a spare bedroom in Cottage 11 Rich...........
711546,Seaweed,2012-07-04 13:16:00,135,Wow I will finally be able to meet some of you.  I will be up on the West Arm at the same time... I will be staying on the other side of the inlet from you all but I will try to stop by and say hi either on the water or on land.  Watch for a Green Nitro.... Seaweed's Swampthing  No use trying for muskie with Lou around though... is there a full moon there this year?  That place goes crazy under the full moon I find... at least doubles the action.  See you there
711551,Roy,2012-07-04 13:28:00,13728,When will you be there Seaweed?
711553,Marty,2012-07-04 13:33:00,873,Have fun guys.  I wish I could pull it off.
711565,motv8tr,2012-07-04 14:14:00,2587,"I'll try to make my way up there one day that week, if not on my scheduled day off, I might take a day off  Marty good to see you're still around, how's the fishing been down there?  Maureen"
711671,lew,2012-07-04 19:46:00,12766, Starting to look like you and me are never gonna share a boat Marty
712663,motv8tr,2012-07-08 09:15:00,2587,I'll be there from Thurs. to Sat. in the prospector tent with my friend and her two boys  Maureen
