723609,kickingfrog,2012-08-19 13:58:00,8333,Ya it's not just population numbers that make a store want to open a new outlet. The entire province of Saskatchewan has just over a million people. You don't need to draw too big of a circle around the gta to get as many people.
723612,cram,2012-08-19 14:12:00,1733,"Whenever I'm at Bass Pro it seems pretty empty.  Even when there's a bit of a crowd there, the checkouts are relatively empty.  Wouldn't be surprised if a run of the mill walmart does more business in 1 or 2 hours than BassPro does in a day."

The highlight of the trip for me is the stop we make at the Cabela’s in Portland, Maine.  It is an absolutely beautiful store.  It’s the only Cabela’s I’ve been in and is way nicer than any of the BPS I’ve been to in the states.  None of the BPS I’ve been into have compared to the BPS in Toronto though.  "
723627,Old Man,2012-08-19 14:56:00,822," The thing is, that out of that 1 million + people, the majority of them engage in hunting, fishing, camping etc. Also, Saskatoon is a major staging point for the North Saskatchewan fly in Lodges and sees a lot of traffic headed north. Add to this the booming economy of Saskatchewan and it's not hard to see why Cabela's chose Saskatoon for their second store. Plus the only serious competion in town was Wholesale Sports.  I was in the Saskatoon store at Preston Crossing on a Wednesday afternoon last month and it was packed."

723658,BillM,2012-08-19 16:58:00,17367," It makes perfect sense.  Get off at Mapleview or Innisfil beach road a quick trip down Sideroad 5 (Veterans) and you are there.  New turning lanes for the NB 400 on Mapleview thanks to the completed construction, so much better then Essa Rd..   That intersection is horrible already, even with nothing special going on, it takes 10 mins to get from Ardagh to BB Point road most days anytime after 4pm.  Whatever civil engineer designed that needs to be fired, lol."

723666,Cudz,2012-08-19 17:21:00,2652,"Hey Bill what do you think of this. It changes throughout the day but About 1/6 of the traffic on essa rd coming down the hill and turning left off Ardagh goes straight through and continues down Essa rd, 1/6 turns south on the 400 (much more in the morning), about 1/3 turns onto 400 ramp North and about 1/3 goes straight until Fairview and turns up Fairview (turns into BBP rd). How about an over or underpass that joins Little to Ardagh.  THey line up almost perfectly and 1/3 of the traffic that wants to get to BBP would either go straight through on Ardagh or turn right if they are coming down Ardagh before they get to the next 2 sets of lights and hwy entrances which is the trouble spot"

723670,misfish,2012-08-19 17:43:00,29133," Barrie is going to be putting a bridge/under pass, from the bottom of Harvey to Fairview. That will eliminate a lot of traffic."
723672,BillM,2012-08-19 17:53:00,17367," Ardagh to BB Point a straight shot over (or under) the highway would be perfect.  It would get rid of that 3rd light (At Essa/BB Point) which is pretty much the cause of all the backups anyhow..  Tt's wishful thinking though, lol!"
723676,Cudz,2012-08-19 18:37:00,2652,I heard that. My friend wont be too happy as he lives just off Harvie rd at the hwy end.  Currently very very quiet. THat would change

723935,myot,2012-08-20 17:24:00,131,  Fishing is only part of the business hunting is huge out there and people also have lots of cash out there take a look at any parking lot in Alberta plently of 1-2 year old 4X4 desel 3/4 tone  Dan
723940,craigdritchie,2012-08-20 17:35:00,1586,"It really is true. I think many people living in the GTA would be astounded by the kind of cash being spent in Alberta and Saskatchewan these days. Walking through the Calgary or Edmonton Sortsmen's Shows is an incredible experience. I saw one boat dealer at the Calgary show this year with 32 ski boats in their booth, and more than half of them were priced north of $100,000. They told me sales were ""great"" - to the point their biggest problem was just getting enough inventory.  The walleye boats are also on a whole other level. We're talking all top-line Rangers, Tritons, Lunds and Starcrafts ... probably the majority selling in the $50,000 range, some over $70,000. Some guy gets into fishing, goes out to buy his first boat, and takes home a $60,000 Stratos with a 225 on the back. I won't even go into the crazy amount of money being spent on electronics and tackle. It's just mind-blowing.  So yeah, I can see Cabela's focusing on that part of the country for now. The GTA has a huge population, but the money is being spent in western Canada - not here."
723946,bare foot wader,2012-08-20 17:50:00,1354,"I wouldn't be too excited about cabela's opening in ON, if it's anything like the Edmonton store it's a let down IMO....but hopefully competition produces competive pricing locally  BPS (calgary and vaughan) has cabelas beat by a landslide in terms of the store cosmetics and selection, even on prices (cabelas edmonton was selling st. croix ice sticks for 36.99....19.99 everywhere else!!!)  I think everybody who is questioning why expand into the prairie provinces are missing a few points, ON is a hard market, there's BPS, Sail, Lebaron plus hard to find prime real estate  economy is booming out west, everybody makes 80-100k ++ on the rigs, mining, logging, etc  I think some people might only be considering fishing sales, but I'd guess that hunting is the top generator at cabelas.......hunting trumps fishing out west, guys spend much more on hunting than they do on fishing, fishing is just a hobby and hunting is a way of life....plus there is MAJOR travel from the US into the prairies to hunt, on top of residents  try buying a jetboat in AB/BC..50K starting and as mentioned, the hardest part is finding inventory"
724145,Billy Bob,2012-08-21 12:33:00,5865," If Cabela's in Canada is like it is in the U.S.A. then  I wouldn't worry about the inventory that a local Cabela's has.....you can go online or call them and order ANYTHING they have and Cabela's will ship it to your local store where you can pick it up at zero shipping cost to you.....you can't beat that with a Ugly Stick....  I have been in 3 different Cabela's throughout the country and I still prefer shopping online. We don't have a local Cabela's and I hope we never get one in NYS....right now I get FREE shipping on anything and I NEVER have to pay sales tax because Cabela's doesn't have a store in NYS.  And as far as hunting being bigger up in the Canadian prairies.....well actually hunting makes more money for any store that sells both....I never thought that was true, but it is.....guys spend a lot of money on hunting......for example......you can up to a fly/drive/boat camp and fish there for lets say $1000 per man per week.....go to that exact same camp to hunt and it will be closer to $4000 per man per week....OUCH...that is one reason I have never gone on any of these hunting trips....been on many fishing trips but never for hunting....all my hunting has been local....but I am going on a snow geese trip in PA come Feb.  Like I said......shop online and have your local Cabela's store ship it in for FREE....my favorite four letter word..."
724159,craigdritchie,2012-08-21 14:20:00,1586,"Guys do spend a LOT of money on hunting. But it's a short season, especially in the west, where fishing is year-round.

569904,tonyb,2011-04-07 13:25:00,1637," Maybe not Tybo! Yesterday, I received the new CANADA version catalogue, instead of the U.S. one I normally receive and order from.   I thought the prices seemed higher in the Canada catalogue vs. what I recall seeing online on Cabelas.com or in the U.S. Catalogue so I thought I would do a quick comparison and last night I did a shopping test between the 2 cabelas.ca and cabelas.com websites.  I picked a random bunch of stuff, that both websites carried and had in stock in order to get a fair comparison.  Here are the items I selected, with standard ground for shipping.  Shimano Stradic 2500 FI spinning reel 20lb Sufix 832 Cabelas No-Vis15lb flourocarbon F9 Rapala  Here is the cost breakdown...  U.S. Cabelas.com Pricing:  Merchandise Total: CAD 201.05  Shipping and Handling Charges: CAD 20.01 Taxes & Duty: CAD 40.54 Fees (Broker): CAD 3.51 Amount Due: CAD $265.11 Payment must be made in US Dollars - Amount Due in USD: $264.33 CANADA Cabelas.ca Pricing:  Merchandise Total: CAD 211.46 Shipping and Handling Charges: CAD 18.95 HST 13%: CAD 29.95  Amount Due: CAD $260.36  Basically, in this case, the Cabelas.ca site is cheaper by almost $5.  There are a couple things to note though.  There are sales on the cabelas.com website that aren't currently being offered on the .ca site.  The selection is better on Cabelas.com...this could change over time but today there are more items available on the .com website.  Also, when you spend over $300 on an order from cabelas.com the shipping cost is fixed at $19.95 but brokerage and duty costs will rise with the order.  My advise is to spend the time entering the order on the .ca site after you have your cart ready to checkout on the .com site to be sure.  It could save you some money.   Hope this helps! Tony "
569905,dave524,2011-04-07 13:41:00,4508,"Cabelas has always impressed me as a outfit that caters to the hunting/outfitting crowd a little more so than fishermen, possibly they view the western provinces as a little less hostile social enviroment to set up shop in."
569906,troutologist,2011-04-07 14:04:00,951,"The store here in Winnipeg, is OK, sure theres a pretty good selection of lots of stuff, and its 1 of 2 stores selling guns in town. My business goes 95% to a local shop Pro Am, tough to beat customer service from a guy that knows whats happening. I'm a believer in supporting stores that work to take care of their customers. Cabelas instore service in Wpg has been less than stellar, though my experiences with the cabelas.com have been excellent.  They recently, added an in store bargin cave which has some excellent deals....still its not like the US stores."
569910,torco,2011-04-07 14:18:00,656,I would love a cabelas in the GTA. After visiting a store in Kansas I found it to be superior to basspro and I have used the website for orders. I also find the cabelas brand stuff to be good value for the money.
569917,Billy Bob,2011-04-07 15:09:00,5865," I typically don't agree...I have a boat and garage full of fishing equipment mostly purchased from Cabela's per mail order because they have good prices and the BEST customer service in the business. I will say they cater to the hunter better than BPS does without doubt.  And about hostile social environment I find the complete opposite true, generally speaking. People are much more friendly and I always feel safer when I'm in a rural setting compared to say NYC.  What I have heard is Cabela's like to set up stores where they have LOTS of room and require 40 acres when possible...this may be the reason you don't see them connected to malls like BPS often are.  There were rumors a few years ago Cabela's was going to build a store in NYS on the very western end of the NYS Thruway around the Ripley, NY area.....very rural but it never materialized and I pray it never does."
569935,Twocoda,2011-04-07 16:02:00,4130,seems the are stepping across the country starting from the west....next will be ontario then quebec then probably one for the maritimes....dont forget in store sales is only a portion of the sales that they do...with the locations they are selecting they are making it more convenient to distribute through the mail...why walk around in a store if you have a cataloge at your door.  this is a perk to having the ALL MIGHTY CANADIAN DOLLAR...thats right ....i said it !!!.. experts project 1.09 by the end of 2012
569993,misfish,2011-04-07 19:51:00,29133," Looks like housing is going there now.   The old race track would be a great place.Easy on/off ramp access for the 400.just like BPS..  I also said before,why are there Ford trucks driving around with Cabelas logo on them?"

The hostile environment was mainly about the perception of firearms/hunting in the greater Toronto area. I recall 40 years ago, picking up my first varmint rifle, a Remington .22-250 at ""Hallams"" which was then on Yonge St. between Bloor and College, packed it in a soft case and got on the subway back to the carpark, try that today and you'd have a dozen cruisers and a swat team on you in seconds"

569649,craigdritchie,2011-04-06 20:18:00,1586,"Last summer I posted that Cabela's was looking to open retail stores here in Canada. They did open a store in Winnipeg (the former S.I.R. mail order location on Ellice Avenue), then announced a new 70,000 square foot store for Edmonton. Today they announced a third store, this one being built in Saskatoon and set to open in spring 2012.  These three locations make a lot of sense for Cabela's, given these cities are the launching off spots for most of the northern fly-in fishing lodges. No ""official"" word yet of a store in Ontario, but I am told privately it is coming.  More info here."
569650,Terry,2011-04-06 20:24:00,14456,well I am going to boycott their prairie stores till they open one in Ontario  make that Bradford Ontario..yeah............   we need one in Ontario
569660,solopaddler,2011-04-06 20:38:00,8605,"Exciting in general but no way no how does it make financial sense to open a huge store in the prairies.  I don't care how many fishermen use the area as a jump off point for fly ins. No way does that compete with the enormous market in the GTA.  Anyhow, I've been on a whole bunch of fly ins over the years and have always been packed and prepared beforehand. I couldn't envision ever buying anything of substance enroute.  Doesn't make any sense whatsoever!  (Or just sour grapes on my part.  )"
569665,misfish,2011-04-06 20:46:00,29133," LOL  Barrie makes more sence to me bud,but hey,it,s only a short drive north for ya.  To me ,three out west is bull."
569667,craigdritchie,2011-04-06 20:50:00,1586,"I don't know about your part solo, but it's definitely sour grapes on mine!!!!  When I was doing a ton of fly-ins I was always amazed at how many guys would show up without even basic stuff like line and steel leaders. They would arrive in town and spend the afternoon shopping for tackle (and booze). Then, fly out first thing the following morning. It was nuts.  I can see the profitability in the western locations even without the fly-in business though. Both Edmonton and Saskatoon are absolutely flush with oil money these days, and most guys there fish and hunt (probably a higher proportion than in southern Ontario). The Edmonton boat show was two weeks ago - you would not believe how many high-end boats they sold there, and by high-end, I mean $50k Pro-Vs and $60k Rangers. Waaaaay more than at Toronto. (Belive it or not, the Edmonton boat show is LARGER than Toronto's). Guys out west have money to spend. Figure that with the comparatively low land values, and yeah, I can see profit in having stores there.  That said - I still want a store in Ontario!!!!"

If there would be a Cabelas going up in the GTA, it'll have to be a much grander store and more competitive than the BPS store here already.  As for one going up in Saskatoon, what else is there to do up there other than hunt and fish??? It'll be a good volume store, but definitely not a store meant for the fly-in lodges around there..."

569677,craigdritchie,2011-04-06 21:03:00,1586,"I'd like them to open a store here, but as long as they're willing to ship stuff to my door, I'm a happy boy."
569678,Roy,2011-04-06 21:06:00,13728,Sail is NOT a competitor....trust me.
569692,DRIFTER_016,2011-04-06 21:23:00,10439,  Can't wait for the Edmonton store to open in the fall!!!
569704,danc,2011-04-06 21:44:00,4677,"Just a little FYI about Cabelas that I found fascinating when I dug deep into their web site. Before they got into the outdoors business, they were in the furniture biz in Nebraska. One of the brothers went to a furniture trade show in Chicago, and while there met a man selling wholesale hand tied fishing flies. The brother bought all of the flies that the guy had for a song. When he got back to Nebraska, he put ads in newspapers throughout the state and neighboring states that read ""One dozen hand tied fishing flies for $1.00"". He sold only one order. So he changed his ad to read ""Free. One dozen hand tied fishing flies. Shipping and handling $1.00"". He couldn't keep up with the orders after that. And that's where the marketing genius began."
569706,GBW,2011-04-06 21:45:00,8460,they should open one right off the 401 in the GTA.
569708,SmokestackLightnin,2011-04-06 21:48:00,390,  The three out west are good market testers.  Barrie does make very good sense with all the new development at Park Place I figured the announcement was coming soon.  Now with the development proposed at Duckworth and 400 there are 2 spots in Barrie that would work.  Both with 400 access that would keep the traffic flow in place.
569721,Blue Lk,2011-04-06 22:03:00,337,"I have been to Cabelas in WPG several times & I have also been in their stores stateside as well as BPS stores south of the border.There is abolutely no comparison between the Wpg store & the American stores. Relax guys you have lost nothing by not getting a Cabelas in the GTA,you would find it dissapointing for sure."
569727,solopaddler,2011-04-06 22:08:00,8605, Yeah well I doubt they'd convert an existing store that was crappy to begin with and call it Cabelas like they did in Winnipeg.  If we ever get one it'll be a clone to their US stores.
569734,asdve23rveavwa,2011-04-06 22:23:00,2690,"Would love to see one here in Ontario...how about down London way, eh, Slowpoke???"
569738,Billy Bob,2011-04-06 22:29:00,5865,Just as long as they NEVER build one anywhere in NYS I'm happy...
569775,craigdritchie,2011-04-06 23:32:00,1586,"Correct. The Winnipeg store on Ellice Ave. used to be a S.I.R. store.  The two new stores (Edmonton and Saskatoon) are brand new builds, and will look like the US stores."
569780,adempsey,2011-04-06 23:35:00,1498,"Those are three fairly major cities in the country (5th, 9th and 17th largest cities in Canada by population) and they don't have much competition.  It makes sense to me, but would really love one near me as well.   They also sell a lot more than fishing gear, which is an important consideration.  I'd be just as happy if I could order from them online using the US catalogue."
569789,kickingfrog,2011-04-06 23:54:00,8333,"Big corperations don't just enter a country on a whim and throw darts at a map to pick locations. That being said, the entire population of Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba combined does not aproch  what would be within a 2 hour drive of a store in the gta.  Take a look at the where bps and cabelas have their stores in the lower 48, and factor in the population density of the areas/states.  Cabelas is more midwest: http://www.cabelas.com/stores/stores_home.jsp?WTz_l=Header  BPS is more east/south: http://www.basspro.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/CFPageC?appID=94&storeId=10151&catalogId=10001&langId=-1"
569832,jjcanoe,2011-04-07 02:28:00,744, 4 whole locations?? LOL more of a hikers haven type store with some fishing gear as an afterthought
569833,jjcanoe,2011-04-07 02:30:00,744,Cabellas has a number of stores out in the middle of nowhwere in the US prarries and they seen to be still around....
569834,beertech,2011-04-07 02:33:00,118,Rumour I heard is they allready bought land in burlington.   
569835,irishfield,2011-04-07 02:35:00,26272, Where... beside where they're going to move Wonderland to?  Also rumour the Cabelas van was seen at the old Barrie Race Track property back in the fall...
