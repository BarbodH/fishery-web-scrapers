724353,Rich Nelson,2012-08-22 14:55:00,332,"Jones, you dont need a  fancy boat and truck to catch fish... My last boat was a piece o crap, and I caught a ton of skis in it. As long as you keep using the proper gear, keep on fishin and posting vids...."
724475,Djeep,2012-08-23 00:44:00,199,"Spoon & SRT8, it would not be the first time jones and I have been mistakin for each other.  its my lund with the 35.  Jones certainly is proof you dont need a boat or vehicle to catch big fish, just some serious determination haha should be coming out for a couple more big girls before I leave LSC for kawarthas muskie fishing"
723860,rufus,2012-08-20 13:27:00,267,"I agree. I have been in that situation where my partner was unable to net a giant muskie that would not fit in the net. The fish eventually got away when my partner attempted to haul it overboard by hand. The fish was too heavy, flopped, and with the gunwale for leverage - was gone. I was giddy regardless.  If someone shushed me in a boat that would be the last time we shared a boat. If I heard myself doing it - when fishing becomes that serious it will be time for me to quit.  Great muskies  - congrats!  "
723862,woodenboater,2012-08-20 13:35:00,2277," yeah, pretty much same here lol. I draw the line at dancing around in circles though"
723864,Djeep,2012-08-20 13:45:00,199,"NWO it certainly is a weird experience being shushed in your own boat!!  in all fairness i was pretty excited on my first 50"" too, a little school girl dance was almost necessary"
723881,FrankTheRabbit,2012-08-20 14:50:00,479,Some epic Jaws moments caught on vid! Nicely done!
723892,RangerGuy,2012-08-20 15:36:00,564,"Great Fish Guys!  I gotta put my 2 cents in just cause it's Monday HAHA!  People kill me!!! Smash someone for mentioning you need a ""PROPER"" net... For the record .. YOUR 100% RIGHT!!!  I would expect somebody with ""Pro"" in thier username to know better  ""I personally wouldn't bother spending all that dough on a bigger net the one you have probably works fine 90% of the time""  I'll spend the money on a boat/motor,musky rods & reels, video camera etc but can't drop enough to purchase the appropriate tools to handle this quality of fish. Bolt cutters and a proper size net are as important to muskie hunting as any lure or rod/reel combo in the boat.  ""Sometimes people aren't prepared for an epic fish like a 55"" musky, it happens"".. Show me one serious musky hunter (especially one that calls himself a ""Pro"") that isn't expecting/hoping to catch 50""+ fish.  A proper size net actually has a calming effect oh ski's, and is less stressful when they can actually float upright and swim while the angler is preparing for the picture. Yes reeling fish in causes stress, I think this is obvious. That's why these nets/cradles were designed to help REDUCE STRESS AT THE BOAT!  I fished ski's with the wrong net for a short period when I started,it only took a few decent size ski's to see that a better method is required for landing these fish.  Oh did I say GREAT FISH!!!!.... Are you goin to get a fiberglass mount made?.."
723893,danbouck,2012-08-20 15:38:00,4380,"Awesome fish and video, congrats!"
723930,ehg,2012-08-20 16:58:00,2666,If that is Lake St.Clair i am starting to think that is best musky fishery in the world. Many posts recently of numbers of fish of great size. Incredible fishes. Congrats.
723959,ProFishermanJones,2012-08-20 18:47:00,77,Thanks dan bouck & ehg your right many great fish with length and girth to come from lake st clair.
723975,mercman,2012-08-20 19:51:00,7054,"Those were some Gnarly Ski's Dude !!!!!!!!!! You handled them well as far as i can tell, and they were released live.Congrats, the vids are a real hoot too:rofl2:"
723976,Christopheraaron,2012-08-20 19:53:00,3525,Don't laugh dood! Is this what usually goes through your head when reeling in a fish?! Oh and great fish!
723986,Rich Nelson,2012-08-20 20:14:00,332,"I could see myself saying the exact same thing... When you are bit by the Musky bug, you dont wanna lose your first 50... I would be pretty serious too! Ha ha And enough broken records talkin about the net... Im sure Jones got the point already. Great vids, keep m comin I know you treat the fish with a lot more respect then most on St Clair! I guess because it is such ausky factory, some guys dont care about the well being of each one."
723991,Handlebarz,2012-08-20 20:35:00,3790,"I can say that these guys are great young guys who have a huge passion for fishing and musky. These guys are our future and they know how to handle these fish they have paid there dues this year with many hours casting LSC and finding the fish and getting them to bite they will be around for a long time and will be able to be better suited for all musky fishing situations.  I also started with a Salmon net I did not know better but my first 47"" fit in and 48"" fit in I knew that I needed a bigger net but could not afford one at the time when I could I got one from the Muskies Canada Odyssey (there is one April 2013 just in case anyone wanted to know 2013 Odyssey link) I used CTC bolt cutters usually go on sale for $8 (I still use them for cutting the wire on every bait I have made) that was what I could afford at the Odyssey I got Knipex cutters $40 instead of $60-$80.  What Im trying to say is these guys do everything they have to get these fish in and released unharmed I give them a huge KUDOES for posting there videos and taking the time to edit them its a lot of work and time.  For what its worth Ron will be getting a net in a couple weeks and Jones will be fishing with other guys who have the proper nets for all there other gear these guys are well suited. These guys are students working there summers away and fishing when they can putting money into there vehicles to get them to school this fall so there money is well spent and prioritized (thanks spell check)  Joey I know you meant no harm with your comments I made the same ones on our local board yes they need a bigger net and YES IAN needs net skills  Sorry Jones Had to add it in LOL. Joey is another class act here as many know but I am not going to start to pump all her great quality's the list is to long and Paul will get depressed"

724000,Joey,2012-08-20 20:52:00,9122,"  Awwww shucks, thanks Mike.   I was just trying to help"
724003,muskymatt,2012-08-20 20:55:00,2608," x3, Mike is one of the most decent people I've met, and is sincere with his advice.  As for the fish, beauty job guys, it'll be that much funner when you don't stress on losing a fish due to a net that is too small.  :thumbsup_anim:"
724025,Pigeontroller,2012-08-20 21:54:00,2793,"Mike posted on the Muskies Canada forum last week asking if anyone had a decent Muskie net laying around...One of our newest members immediately responded that he had one, I'm assuming he's giving it away... This spring I was fortunate enough to collect Muskie eggs with two very dedicated OMNR Biologists for the LSMRP. The Cradles they were using were literally falling apart...I posted that on the MCI forum and I had 3 nice cradles donated...  Thats typical of the passion Muskies Canada members have for these fish."
724128,ProFishermanJones,2012-08-21 04:44:00,77,"Thanks Mike, I'm really glad you understand and see where we are coming from. ""they will be around for a long time and will be able to be better suited for all musky fishing situations."" couldn't have said it better my self, not trying to disrespect anyone on here or any musky fisherman by using the equipment i do. thanks again mike your kindness and understanding does not go unnoticed & i really appreciate you putting this into perspective and better words then i could have.  -Ian"
724133,Handlebarz,2012-08-21 10:14:00,3790,Dax is right I had put a offer on the MCI site for anyone with a used net and wanted to trade some of my lures for it I explained these young guys to them and had a offer right away then another member from OFC offered a NEW net for free so yes Ron will be getting a net if our members want to put there names here they can I will not mention them but they are both members here and one is a MCI member great guys.  So who here wants to help get Jones a net now??? does anyone in the OFC family have a used musky net they can part with?  All I ask of the guys getting the help with this is pay it back down the road I have been helped over my life time with things I need but cant afford so I just try and pay back now by doing the same thing. I know that OFC family has a long history of doing these things that is why its so popular and that's why we can all fight about stupid things from time to time and then move on that's what families do.  BTW thanks Paul Matt and Davey  Joey your always awesome did not mean to make you blush I hope that does not mean Roy is gonna take a strip off me
724278,Jigger,2012-08-22 00:33:00,1237,"Great vids PFJ! Wish i lived closer to LSC these days. Like ehg said, some awesome fish coming out of there! Congrats on the great fish!"
724288,Dontcryformejanhrdina,2012-08-22 01:42:00,535,"Unbelievable! Truly a giant fish (well both are), congrats!  Thanks for posting the videos."
724299,SRT8 smoker craft,2012-08-22 02:22:00,1107,were you guys out of mitchells bay sunday ? saw a boat with the same 35hp motor at the weigh in around 4 . nice fish by the way
724309,e-z-out,2012-08-22 03:42:00,1052,That was a great video guys congrats and hope to see more from you jones

724315,ProFishermanJones,2012-08-22 06:34:00,77,"Thanks again mike p, i hate taking hand outs. never been one to do it. personally before i do any more serious fishing i want to get my self a nice vehicle &  nice boat and a few other important things. I'm glad you guys at Muskies Canada where able to help someone out in that way, that shows a lot of respect for the sport & other anglers. a lot of people think the ""pro"" means I'm a millionaire with a boat and a brand new tundra LOL not the case, the name may elude many, but don't let it . Jigger - thanks a lot buddy, lsc is an awesome fishery thats for sure, lots of under fished areas on an over fished lake, i hope to one day expand my boundaries and fish lots of lakes across canada. Dontcryformejanhrdina - thanks for the kind words, and i wasn't out, i do not own the 35 john, i don't fish with those guys that much anymore, nor anyone, Joes - you will see more, rather it be 5 months, 10 months, 2 years 3 ye..... there will be more to come  i gotta get a boat so i can make some serious videos and do some serious fishing. Spoon - i kinda have a similar resemblance to the owner of the 35hp but don't get it twisted!aha i do not have a boat.  & thanks everyone on OFC for viewing and leaving the nice comments, it dosent happen much but i really do appreciate the time you guys took to watch my video & leave nice comments.

723726,ProFishermanJones,2012-08-19 21:52:00,77,"Well I'm going to post two videos from this last week, one of my Personal best muskie 51.5"" and one of my friends 55"" his first muskie caught casting as he usually trolls.  51.5 - after a long season putting in lots of time on the water i finally hook into a beast! measuring 51.5"" and girthy. a few quick pics and release to swim another day 51.5"" Video -  55"" - no tail pinch, fish was hooked good and i was the net man, i know it was a sketchy net job but at least she got to the boat! after a monster hook set and good battle boat side she was unhook and released with ease to swim another day  55"" Video -   don't want to talk to much about these fish i will let the videos speak for them selfs. as always i hope you enjoy ontariofishingcommunity."
723730,manitoubass2,2012-08-19 22:05:00,11391,"dood, dood, seriously? dood....  Wow, dood, thanks dood.  I'm almost speechless, that was epic, dood"
723731,BradMc76,2012-08-19 22:11:00,56,Wow. Very nice. I can't wait to catch something like that. Fight must have been great.
723732,ProFishermanJones,2012-08-19 22:13:00,77,"dooood. lol thats all i could say. the slow motion really made for a good doooood i ruined it doood. thanks dood, hope you were speechless of the fish & not my net job on that hogdoggler 55"" haha i got a good laugh out of your post by the way."
723733,manitoubass2,2012-08-19 22:17:00,11391," Dood, I wasn't even making fun of you! Thats was really just my reaction, lol. Those are crazy good fish and the videos are priceless. The net job wasn't too bad, we've all done it. But you got it in the net, thats all that matters, dood!  Thanks for that post and those videos, and lol's.  "
723734,Joey,2012-08-19 22:19:00,9122,"Wow, you seriously need a bigger net bud!!!!   Very nice fish but the netting is atrocious, you'd have been better hauling it in by hand under the gill plate carefully!!"
723736,manitoubass2,2012-08-19 22:28:00,11391," Eh, it's not like the fish was harmed. Sometimes people aren't prepared for an epic fish like a 55"" musky, it happens. I'm sure he knows now.  He said the fish was released unharmed, good enough for me. Let him enjoy the unbelievable catches. I'm thankful he posted them up."
723739,NAW,2012-08-19 22:36:00,4022,Wow..  Monster fish  X2 on the bigger net  Might make things easier on the net man.
723740,Joey,2012-08-19 22:36:00,9122,"Hey, no worries Manitoubass2, all I'm saying is if you are going to target musky, you need to be prepared, and if he's lucky enough to catch musky that size, next time bring a bigger net is all."
723741,Rich Nelson,2012-08-19 22:40:00,332," ya, you would be a real genius grabbing a 50 plus incher by gill plate witha couple of giant hooks thrashing around...  great fish Jones!  we all gotta start somewhere."
723742,manitoubass2,2012-08-19 22:43:00,11391," Yeppers, I agree. But like I said, I'm sure he knows now!  Not tryin to start anything, just adding my two cents.  Again, great catches!  "
723750,Joey,2012-08-19 23:10:00,9122," No genius here, but been there, done that.  When Paul's 52""er would not fit in the net and I could see the harm it was causing the fish trying to net it, you bet I grabbed it and hauled her in.  She swam away beautifully and nobody got hurt, we bought a bigger net the next weekend.  Lets not let this get ridiculous, I'm just giving constructive criticism, that's all.  Believe me, we've all learned a few things catching the big ones and I know a few things now I did not know before.  Just trying to help is all!!!  The more safe musky releases the better"
723761,ProFishermanJones,2012-08-19 23:38:00,77,"bigger net comments are not even worth my time anymore Muskie videos/fishing are a lose lose situation, bigger net....grab it by the gill plate...., either way someone will get ticked off dosent take a genius to know that eh joey &thanks N.A.W, BladeBurner, joey, manitoubass2 much appreciated."
723779,DundasSteelheader,2012-08-20 00:25:00,166,"Sick fish man, those are some real trophies, you should be proud. Who even cares about the sketchy net job, got it in the boat and I dont see how it could have done any harm to the fish at all. I personally wouldn't bother spending all that dough on a bigger net the one you have probably works fine 90% of the time.. Again, great fish dude"

723789,SlowPoke,2012-08-20 00:58:00,2984,"""Hogdoggler"" LMAO!!! Both great fish and congrats to both of you.   Here's the irony. Had they opted for a quality nets instead of the GoPro's, we're not having this conversation or seeing this fiasco. It's great that the fish swam away but maybe somebody reading this thread will benefit from Joey's comment and allocate funds towards a suitable net rather than a nicer rod/reel, more lures or electronics."
723810,Djeep,2012-08-20 02:02:00,199,"i couldnt help but laugh, jones didnt think it was quite so funny. that 51.5 it was a helluva fish. never been so nervous tryin to put one in the net. 2 biggest ive seen on lsc this year.  edit: the gopro came as a present to both of us, but i know what youre saying. we're trying to get a better net. jones had one for a day till my first 50"" bit thru it. apparently it wasnt as good as thought."
723821,mistaredone,2012-08-20 02:51:00,913,Great fish guys!!!  Congrats on two giant fish.  Bad net jobs make for great memories. Love the vids. Had a good laugh. Can't wait to hit LSC in the fall. Keep the vids coming.

723847,aplumma,2012-08-20 11:47:00,6896,Nice fish and a great first post let's not get this locked down because of a net fight. The comment of bigger net was given in the light of good spirits let's keep this thread about the fish and the video and not bash each other.   Art
