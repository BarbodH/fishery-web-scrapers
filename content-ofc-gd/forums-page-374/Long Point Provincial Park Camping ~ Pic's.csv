723194,solopaddler,2012-08-17 12:34:00,8605,"With the date for my Hudsons Bay trip quickly approaching I cleared my callendar this week to spend a bit of time with the kids.  Long Point has been one of our favourite destinations for a while now. It's close to home, the beach is spectacular, and many of the campsites are just steps away. We were lucky enough to reserve one adjacent to the beach and just spent two glorious days basking in the sun. No bugs, warm sunshine, a light breeze and happy kids.  It doesn't get any better.                   "
723199,danbouck,2012-08-17 13:17:00,4380,There's nothing better! (maybe a trip to Hudson Bay  )
723215,bigbuck,2012-08-17 14:22:00,2449,Nice. Your kids know what real fun is all about. Not playing video games or being strapped in front of the tube.
723227,Spiel,2012-08-17 15:23:00,9065,Undoubtedly good fun for the kids.  Did you bring any sand home with you.
723241,lhousesoccer,2012-08-17 16:43:00,442,I had a nice big fat tick stuck in the back of my leg after my last trip to Long Point.  Hope you checked your kids over Mike!  Looks like fun though!
723259,blaque,2012-08-17 18:18:00,2419,"The Great Lakes.......all the feel of oceanfront vacationing, none of the jellyfish or hurricanes"
723261,Joey,2012-08-17 18:34:00,9122,Looks like paradise to me
723264,spincast,2012-08-17 18:38:00,3279,now thats a water front campsite. Looks like the kids had a blast. Mere metres away from all those fish and no rods? Not sure I could do that.
723321,rob v,2012-08-17 22:04:00,535,long point's a great place - been there many times as a kid and later as an adult also.  early in the bass season pitch a tent in the park and you're at the launch in the bay at 5 am easy-peasy.  Unfortunately  I'm sure you're aware  of the area's notoriety for deer ticks and the undertow that lake erie is famous for.  I'm already looking forward to your report on your trip north !
723336,solopaddler,2012-08-17 22:42:00,8605,"Thanks guys, it was a blast. On a realated note I cruised the entire park to suss out the very best campsites for future trips. 'Course it's subjective, but if anyone's interested drop me a line.      Just a bit. It's unreal how it gets into everything.  Already told you, but the rod is fantastic. It's exactly what I was hoping for.    My daughter had a panic attack when we walked past the park boundary. There's a huge sign warning about ticks LOL! We're fine, we didn't really stray from the beach.  Anyhow in my experience they're at their worst earlier in the season."
723379,hotsky,2012-08-18 01:55:00,400,I'm in Hamilton too and been camping about 3 times a year at Long point for last 3 years now. Going again next weekend for a few days .  And no ticks yet
723382,Broker,2012-08-18 02:00:00,482,"Love that place , usually go on may 24 and thanksgiving weekend. We've been lucky enough to be able to swim and have hot sunny weather, for 2 straight years on both weekends  I also usually head to the little river you cross going in, its a great spot to catch perch from shore and cook em over the fire"
723384,hotsky,2012-08-18 02:07:00,400,"Ah yes the Big Creek, you can rent a canoe or a rowboat there too."
723457,fishboy,2012-08-18 15:50:00,550,Long Point is one of the best beaches in Ontario..love the place
723464,mercman,2012-08-18 17:01:00,7054,You are a very lucky man Mike Great family time for sure.Thanks for sharing.

724509,Rich,2012-08-23 10:14:00,3927,"It must be cuz i live here, but i can think of a lot of other places id rather camp. Lol  It IS an excellent beach, thats for sure."
