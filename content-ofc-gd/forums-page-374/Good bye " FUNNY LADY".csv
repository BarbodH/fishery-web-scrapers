People would peek and then they'd boo.""  — ""I never made 'Who's Who,' but I'm featured in 'What's That?' ""  — ""When I told Fang I was going to have my face lifted, he said, 'Who'd steal it?'""  — ""You know you're old when your walker has an airbag.""  — ""I was the world's ugliest baby. When I was born, the doctor slapped everybody.""  — ""I became a stand-up comedienne because I had a sit-down husband.""  — ""My vanity table is a Black & Decker workbench.""  — ""The only thing domestic about me is I was born in this country.""  — ""They say housework can't kill you, but why take the chance?""  — ""I have so many liver spots, I ought to come with a side of onions.""  — ""Think of me as a sex symbol for men who just don't give a damn.""  — ""The best contraceptive for old people is nudity.""
