723968,jeffw,2012-08-20 19:36:00,267,i just got my new 3/4wt rod and want to go up to the forks and was wondering if anyone had been there recently and could tell me what the water temps Were. On a side note i was up at my dads on Sat on sturgeon lake and there was a really nice light  cahill  hatch going on. Cheers Jeff

723993,davey buoy,2012-08-20 20:36:00,5505," The odds are better ,you check it out,and let us know!. Probably the way it's going to work out. Could be wrong.lol."
724396,jeffw,2012-08-22 19:24:00,267,just checked the water temp and it was 65 also saw afew nice trout. Cheers Jeff
724399,davey buoy,2012-08-22 19:32:00,5505," Way to go,now you know!!!You won't find many river secrets here,and if you find one ,Pm,or keep them to yourself!.Lot's of lurkers."
724421,jeffw,2012-08-22 20:35:00,267,not looking for river secrets or locations i know where the good pools and riddles are i just wanted water temps.
724446,ehg,2012-08-22 22:28:00,2666," Ya, the guy was asking about water temp, nothing else.  So far there have been 172 page views not ""Lot's of lurkers"". Probably mostly return visits...  The amount of people fishing is dropping. Except for urban tribs not much to worry about.  Lurkers is a myth... back in the early 80's i would count a 100 boats jigging walleye on Pigeon on a Sat. evening. Now with internet there might be a half dozen there on Sat. evening."
724448,davey buoy,2012-08-22 22:32:00,5505," Just be carefull,have to go to the river to get the temperature?right?. Just look at the members and guests.I think you'll get what I'm talking about ehg."
