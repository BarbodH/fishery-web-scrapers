724625,Sinker,2012-08-23 21:51:00,8692,"I do it a lot.  Really easy.  Just put the meat in clean bottles, put the rings and lids on just snug, boil for 4 hrs, remove from water and let cool...the lids will seal. Thats it. Add some ""stuff"" to them if you like. I usually put some garlic, onions, salt, and pepper to mine. Goose is great canned!   S."
