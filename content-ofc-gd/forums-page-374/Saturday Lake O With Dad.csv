724237,Jen,2012-08-21 20:28:00,833,"  Well that was the outcome...  I went fishing with my dad and little sister on Saturday morning.  After listening to the man coming in say it was rough and there were no fish we looked at one another questioningly...shrugged our shoulders and decided we were going out anyway.  It was calm within a couple of hours.    We put the lines out once we hit 40 fow. Downriggers at 20ft with spin doctors and flys back 30ft, and our beautiful day began.  Two knock offs and no fish in the boat. I just couldn't set a hook for the life of me.  At 100fow, we put out dipsy's on a 3 setting back 92ft with green ladder back and bloody nose moonshine lures hitting two fish within the first few minutes...    Dad knew where the fish were for sure...in four hours, four fish and we were headed home. A great day on the water, lots of fun and the best way to relax away a Saturday.        All going on the smoker tonight."

724381,Jen,2012-08-22 17:56:00,833,"I am betting he is laughing his ass off Roy! Got home and notice that the bunks on the trailer needed replacing, the wire on the riggers was unravelling, a good four hours of maintenance needed doing! Little bratt has his feet up fishing some well stocked heavenly lake I am sure...Thanks for the comments, can't wait to get out again."
