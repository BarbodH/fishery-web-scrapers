723802,woodenboater,2012-08-20 01:35:00,2277,"Had to take down a Norway maple in our backyard that was leaning way too much (and over the car and laneway) and a had a bifurcated trunk. In Toronto at least, if the tree was X diameter at X height, then it needed a permit. If the measurements were < X numbers, one was good to go to remove it. So we hired an arborist to inspect and give a report to the bureaucrats. They were being kinda dickish about it but we got approval. Cost some $ but it beat waiting for the tree to topple during heavy storms.  I think dropping this baby privately and sans permit (if you need one) is going to be a problem unless one climbs with a lightweight Echo chainsaw or one has access to a bucket. Much will also depend on your neighbours and whether or not they like the tree and don't want it gone (even if on your property, they could snitch on you if you cut it down without approval=fines) Going ""timberrrr"" could lead to major headaches."
723803,mercman,2012-08-20 01:36:00,7054,You dont have Cormorants nearby do you?

723848,manitoubass2,2012-08-20 12:02:00,11391,"I'll be right over in the skid steer. Take that tree down no problem in about 10 minutes. Get a a yard or two of new soil, and I'll remove roots and all. Hack the branches, fire up the ol chainsaw and make ya some firewood too. Start to finish, maybe two hours.  Only problem is I'm probably 20 hours away from you, lol."
723850,woodenboater,2012-08-20 12:24:00,2277,"btw, if this is the work of the worm, permits should be super slick to get and I wonder if the city should/ could cover the cost ?"
723934,Dara,2012-08-20 17:20:00,3052,Call your insurance company and say...hey..I have a tree here about to cost you some big bucks...wanna do something about it
723945,Headhunter,2012-08-20 17:49:00,5703,"Can't Paul just talk that tree down? Joey, check with your city on protocols required... especially if you have a busy body neighbour... HH"
723956,esoxansteel,2012-08-20 18:43:00,1307,"    Isnt it worth the 20 plus hour drive for 4 to 5 cases of beer?, im sure Joey and Paul would supply the fuel for the chainsaw, and maybe even the skid steer"
724007,misfish,2012-08-20 21:09:00,29133,The suspense is killing me. Are we having a tree cutting down G2G?   
724015,Joey,2012-08-20 21:33:00,9122,"We have great neighbours (they gave us a $200 bottle of Dom Perignon for our wedding day), and I don't think they'd give me a hard time about taking it down, it's actually leaning more to their house than ours, so a storm would take out their bedroom  I'll call the city tomorrow and find out what has to be done to get it taken down, if it's a matter of us just taking it down, we're good for a G2G tree taking down Brian"

723488,Joey,2012-08-18 21:26:00,9122,"My pine tree seems to be dying from the top down.    I've googled it with not much success as there could be many reasons, but not really the answer I'm looking for since the bottom seems so healthy and I don't see any beetles or bugs on it.  I don't use pesticides in the yard either.  Any arbourists or anyone have any ideas?  I've taken a pic of the top, which this year started with only about 1 foot of dead parts, which has now ended up at about 5 or 6 feet of dead.  Bottom and middle are fine and looking healthy, but at this rate, it's not looking good that it will make it much longer.  I took a long shot too so you can see how tall the tree actually is, so it must be pretty old and secure in the ground by now.  Any ideas?  lightening maybe?  Thanks for your help anyone.          "
723492,kickingfrog,2012-08-18 21:50:00,8333,That's a spruce tree unfortunately. Look up spruce budworm.
723498,HTHM,2012-08-18 22:16:00,4082,"Joey, Hate to say it, but it is gone. Cut it down sooner than later to mitigate possible spread of the problem."
723499,Joey,2012-08-18 22:59:00,9122,"Crap, that's what I was worried would have to happen, okay, thanks guys.   Wonder if I need a permit for that???"
723502,Old Man,2012-08-18 23:20:00,822,"Here's some detailed info as to what's happening to your Colorado Blue Spruce.  Spruce Budworm (Choristoneura fumiferana) The spruce budworm is a destructive forest pest which sometimes attacks shade trees. It prefers balsam fir and white spruce, but also injures red, black, Norway, Engelmann, and blue spruces, hemlock, and larch. The adults are dull-grey moths with the forewings overlaid with spots of brown. They are in flight in July or early August and deposit masses of overlapping eggs on the underside of needles near the periphery of the crown. The larvae hibernate without feeding in the autumn. They become active in the spring, generally two weeks before the bursting of the buds of balsam fir. The new buds of staminate flowers are attacked first, if present, otherwise the larvae mine into the old needles before moving to the ends of the branches and boring into the expanding vegetative buds. When half-grown, the larvae tie the tips of two or more twigs together with silk, forming a small nest. The larvae are brown with a yellowish stripe laterally, and light spots on the back. Feeding is completed by the end of June and pupation takes place among the loose webs on the twigs. There is only one generation per year. The beauty of infested trees is temporarily spoiled because as the needles dry they turn brownish. Heavy feeding results in stunted growth, especially in the tops, and tree death.   CONTROL • Spray the foliage when the caterpillars are actively feeding from mid-May to mid-June. Use dimethoate, malathion, carbaryl, B.t., or acephate. • Do not use Malathion on blue spruce."
723503,Sinker,2012-08-18 23:37:00,8692,"Yep, I'd say that one has gone too far to help it. Budworm for sure.  It will make OK campfire wood!  S."
723593,Toad Hunter,2012-08-19 13:28:00,261,not sure of where you're at but around here anything 15' or taller requires a permit
723596,davey buoy,2012-08-19 13:34:00,5505,Make sure you hire a insured contractor. The houses are a little close for error.
723630,Twocoda,2012-08-19 15:04:00,4130,bud worm is probably the right answer ..phinitrathion or malathion are two chemicals to kill them i used to work forest protection in the late 80s in New Brunswick.. unfortunately for the tree..it needs to be removed though its going to be a fire hazzard soon

723636,Sinker,2012-08-19 15:20:00,8692,"  No need to even tie that one to anything, B. That tree is a piece of cake. You might lose a limb off the birch, but should be able to clear it  The biggest problem with that one is the mess its going to make!   S."
