723942,asdve23rveavwa,2012-08-20 17:43:00,2690,"It feels like I've known Simon (aka Pikeslayer) for a couple years, although, Saturday morning was the first time we ever met face to face.  This long awaited meeting took place due to Simon's generous offer of  a morning of fishing on Lake O aboard his boat as a donation for the Fishing For A Cure For Cancer event.  I was fortunate enough to be the recipient, and who better to take with me than Juli and her dad Craig.  Craig has helped us so much with our basement work in the last year, it was the least I could do.  So the stage was set for what turned out to be a picture perfect morning on Lake Ontario. What a great way to end the final weekend before our family trip up north.  I'll let the ""pics"" tell the story.            Not sure if Simon was doing the Breakfast Club or Rocky on this one...    Juli's new PB Rainbow,29"" and really fat!!      My SSE (smallest salmon ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!)    The crew gave me a do-over, lol, nice little ""eater"" bow      Juli with another little salmon      One happy dude!!    The captain gets a turn    Craig at the wheel    The post fishing group shot     Have a couple of pretty funny videos of Juli fighting fish that I may add later.  Anybody that has witnessed it can vouch for her excitement.  Thanks, again, Simon for a fantastic time on the water.  The fish truly were a bonus...for those that care, we went 9 for 10 including Juli's PB bow and my 30"" bow that I didn't bother posting a photo of due to some blood around it's mouth. All four of us couldn't have asked for a more beautiful day.  Looking forward to sharing a boat with you again Simon"
723950,danbouck,2012-08-20 17:57:00,4380,"I know that spot!  Glad you guys had a great day, that Simon guy is alright."
723953,Live2fish85,2012-08-20 18:29:00,1633,"Awesome Report Frank. Looks like you all had a great day, that is a great prize as well."
723955,adolson,2012-08-20 18:41:00,783,Nice report! Those are some gorgeous pics (even the ones without fish in them)!
723957,corvette1,2012-08-20 18:45:00,1765,awesome trip congrats
723964,misfish,2012-08-20 19:28:00,29133,Great day to be out fishing.
723974,ccmtcanada,2012-08-20 19:47:00,7971,Great stuff guys!  Congrats on the personal best!  Was a great day to be out on the water for sure
724016,Handlebarz,2012-08-20 21:36:00,3790,Awesome what a great looking day and to have her pops with you guys is just the icing on the cake.  Great looking sign Juli
724027,Pikeslayer,2012-08-20 21:55:00,1443," Yes, please post a video Frank for those who have never fished with Juli. Her excitement & enthusiasm were the highlights of the day (SSE being a close second). Best fishergirl aboard ever  And BTW, I'm pretty sure I asked Juli not to take any pictures of me without my hat as I did not have time to do my hair in the morning"
724052,FisherJuli,2012-08-20 23:01:00,125,"Simon- for the record, you asked me not to take a mad-doctor hair pic AFTER I took that one... I listened... But Frankie happened to like your wild silhouette!!!  It was definitely a great time, and it was certainly a much appreciated prize from the Fish A Thon for a Cure- so thank you again! Simon, you are a character...and fun to be out fishing with! Shucks...thanks for the compliment!  As for the reaction to my fish... I blame the lack of oxygen to my lungs as my muscles took over!!!  It is always a treat to have my dad out with me-- he's an insanely selfless guy (and the best dad) who inspired my love (and wacky enthusiasm) of fishing... So that was a real treat!!!  My biceps today remind me of how many times I reeled those little and biggies in! Fun, fun, fun!"
724062,spincast,2012-08-20 23:59:00,3279,"Looks like  a great day out there. Simon - you know what I mean when I say when it comes to watching, and listening to Juli when she has a fish on, it is a riot. Enthusiatic only touches the exitement.  You just cant help but smile and share her energy. Sweet bow ther Juli - congrats on the PB.   Glad you guys finally got together and got a chance to get Craig out too. Looks like the Simon guy has them dialed in  pretty well."
724080,FisherJuli,2012-08-21 01:03:00,125,"Thanks, Rick!!  For the record, Rick and Simon both have the recipe for a great day on Lake O: technique, instinct, and the ability to get us on some fun fish!! I mean, come on, who can't have fun?!!! It was interesting to see the lake from a different angle, but it is gorgeous from any angle at an early hour!  "
724081,Pikeslayer,2012-08-21 01:16:00,1443, We should work out a trip trade next year Rick. I've never fished out of Jordan.
724082,skeeter,2012-08-21 01:25:00,1907,Fishing with Simon is always a blast. Great report and day out on the water.
724123,fishnsled,2012-08-21 03:43:00,3520,"Great report!! Always nice to pick up a new PB, congrats!! Nice hat Frank! Mine could be a new lucky fishing hat for me."
724131,spincast,2012-08-21 09:02:00,3279,  Great idea - you're on! I havent hit the North shore.
724138,Rod Caster,2012-08-21 11:23:00,5784,"Great morning shots, and that 29"" bow is a monster! Way to contribute nearly all the fish on your team Julie"
724146,Billy Bob,2012-08-21 12:50:00,5865,That rainbow is definitely NOT a steelhead...all rainbow there.....so no worries about keeping it...  Now that 4th picture....the silhouette....that has to be Woody Woodpecker holding a fishing rod....
724151,asdve23rveavwa,2012-08-21 13:34:00,2690," Hey Dan-O, we really had a blast.  Thanks, bud!   Thanks, Chris.  Glad you got out with Rick that morning, too.  We'll have to get together for some of those Erie smallies!   Thanks, Will!  That bow fought like a salmon, Juli had a great time bringing it in.  Yup, love the Fishing For A Cure/Shimano cap...lightweight, and, adds great colour to photos (THANKS to Dave Mercer for that one)   Hey Chad!!  First off congrats!!  Second, yeah, Juli really seems to be carrying that team, LOL.    Everyone else, thanks for the comments.  Juli, the boys, and I are hitting the road north in three days.  Time to shift the focus from silver to gold"
724175,Leecher,2012-08-21 15:29:00,7832,"Great report, fish and pics Frankie   Looks like fun was had by everyone... your smiles say it all   Congrats to Juli on her PB Thanks for sharing Jacques"
724228,Spiel,2012-08-21 20:10:00,9065,Beautiful. Nothing like a little Lake O outing in the wee hours when she's like glass.  Good on you Simon for offering the outing and congrats to team 10's star angler.
724231,Christopheraaron,2012-08-21 20:18:00,3525," It's alright frank, just imagine it's a perch!"
724290,asdve23rveavwa,2012-08-22 01:56:00,2690," LOL Christopher, I was thinking more speckle trout."
724291,FisherJuli,2012-08-22 01:59:00,125,"Hahaha... Great comments, guys! I know team 10 has it in them... I know it!!  But, hey- maybe the north can bring me some more fisher girl luck!  "
724335,Billy Bob,2012-08-22 13:00:00,5865, It's too small and skinny for a Lake Erie perch...
