724366,ninepointer,2012-08-22 16:21:00,4,"I want to hear from those who actually use their electrics for trolling.  I'd like to do more slow walleye trolling on my inland shield lake, but my old 20 hp 2-stroke sucks for trolling, yet is still fine for getting around.  Considering that I already have a 30lb. thrust Minn Kota on my transom (I currently use the electric for positioning and the boat is a 16' plain-jane bench-seat aluminum), I'm thinking that something like a 55lb. 12v transom-mount Minn Kota Traxxis might meet my trolling needs, which would typically be 3 hours trolling at most.  Getting a bigger electric would certainly be more affordable for me than getting a new outboard.  What are your experiences & suggestions?"
724367,mercman,2012-08-22 16:36:00,7054,"I have a 16' Princecraft console with a 40 on it. I use a Minn Kota Edge bow mount, 45lb thrust. I get 1.3 to 1.7 mph out of it when trolling, and thats in 3rd and 4th speed. I can troll easy 4-5 hours."
724370,Rich Nelson,2012-08-22 16:55:00,332,"Drift sock, or 5 gallon pailwill slow your 20 hp down while getting your rpms up higher."
724373,Squid,2012-08-22 16:59:00,1656,"Silent trolling with the minnkota, can't be beat. I can troll at 1.5mph all day."
724374,NAW,2012-08-22 17:05:00,4022,I run a 36lb on a 14' aluminum.  Can troll dead slow all weekend long.  It's one of my favourite ways to fish.  Bought the biggest battery I could for it.  I would suggest bigger then 36lb.
724378,sneak_e_pete,2012-08-22 17:34:00,540,I have an 80lb Terrova on an 18ft that's all I use when trolling.
724397,jedimaster,2012-08-22 19:29:00,3472,"go for it, I use my 55 pound on my 16 footer when I troll for walleye all day."
724400,bushart,2012-08-22 19:32:00,2628,You can also backtroll with that 20
724401,Handlebarz,2012-08-22 19:32:00,3790,For walleye I use my auto pilot 100% of the time. I can set it the directin I want to go and not worry about the wind pushing me off my track.  I also love it for speed I can set it for the exact speed I need
724423,ninepointer,2012-08-22 20:43:00,4,"Thanks for the replies & suggestions.  I'm no stranger to back-trolling and I've done the drift bucket thing, but I'm liking the electric option better."
724432,Sinker,2012-08-22 21:25:00,8692,"I'd recommend a power drive bowmount strictly for trolling. I don't really like the power drive units, but I LOVE mine for slow trolling eyes. Its the best thing since sliced bread!  I can sit in my seat at the tiller, and have full control of direction and speed as well as both hands free to fish. No need to be constantly steering a tiller from the back, while the bow gets blown all over. The bowmount has way more control than a transom mount electric.  I set mine straight ahead, and steer with my main engine (tiller). 99% of the time this works great. If its real windy, I will have to steer a little with the foot pedal, but its gotta be pretty windy.  I can troll a good 5-6hrs non stop at 3/4 throttle with my 55lb into a good wind, up to 2mph, no problem. Trolling with the wind is a piece of cake, and I use much less battery that way too.  Just my thoughts....I use my bowmount strictly for trolling 99% of the time!  S."
724457,sneak_e_pete,2012-08-22 23:02:00,540,"If its in the budget, get the ipilot... Wicked awesome!!!"
724471,Rich,2012-08-23 00:24:00,3927,"I troll with mine when using harnesses on the big boat, otherwise i troll with it normally on my small boats. Works great on small lakes that dont see a lot of trolled lures."
724473,Rich,2012-08-23 00:25:00,3927,Ps: bring a spare battery
724504,John Bacon,2012-08-23 04:08:00,3277,I have done a lot of trolling with an electric motor. But I recommend a bow mount. A transom mount will be okay when there is no wind; a bow mount will work in almost all conditions.
724505,limeyangler,2012-08-23 04:12:00,5204,"55Lb Terrova here on a 17"" tinny with false floors....never use my outboard for trolling. On a calm day i could go all day...with headwind i would say about 4 hours at 1.5 to 2mph"
724513,mike rousseau,2012-08-23 11:28:00,4661,On a lake you should be good with a 55lb...  Whether  you want bow or transom that's personal preference...
724772,whiskywizard,2012-08-24 14:19:00,305,"  +1  It's the best trolling system there is. It has 20 speed settings - 0 thru 10, in 1/2 increments so you can get perfect lure action, even if the wind is affecting you.  It will steer straight ahead, or hold a compass heading or follow a route that you program into it. If there's a shoreline, weedline or contour line that you like to follow, run it once and the iDrive will remember  it, and follow it forward and backward, all day long.  Many guys prefer the foot control, especially if they're usually up on the foredeck, casting. But for trolling, the handheld remote is better; it works from anywhere in the boat that you want to be.  Once you get onto the fish or need to fight a fish, hit the ""anchor"" button and the iDrive will hold you right there in that spot, despite wind or current."
724815,krixxer,2012-08-24 17:27:00,274,I have a transom mounted Traxxis 50lb that is connected to 2 24's I can get a honest 6 hours of trolling in my little 16 footer.  Lebaron had the traxxis on sale for 300 on fatherâ€™s day  
724830,fishboy,2012-08-24 18:16:00,550,bow mount electric for me...curious what speed are you guys generally running when fishing for 'eyes?
