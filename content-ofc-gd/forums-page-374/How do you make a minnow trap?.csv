724541,Christopheraaron,2012-08-23 13:52:00,3525,"You can take a large soda bottle cut off the top, reverse it to make a funnel, bait and weight it and you're done. Ofvcourse they do sell them for like $7."
724560,J.C.,2012-08-23 15:17:00,11,Hey would anyone know size limits allowed for traps? Are dip nets allowed to be used to catch bait and if so is there a size restriction?

724569,smally21,2012-08-23 15:52:00,993,"we use a 3 or 4 foot square net, suspended over a busy spot with a little bait on top..minnows swim over top, wait til there is a bunch...whammo! in the net you pulled up.  the rest of the time we use a 7$ trap sold just about everywhere."
724575,Christopheraaron,2012-08-23 16:10:00,3525, Would that be classified as a dip net?
724587,J.C.,2012-08-23 17:18:00,11,6' Dip net. Thanks Christoph had been looking for that.
724668,Billy Bob,2012-08-24 00:51:00,5865,What I never could understand is WHY non-residents can't catch their own bait...ESPECIALLY on fly in trips where you don't have the advantage of sometimes purchasing bait when needed. We don't have those restrictions here.

724731,Skipper D,2012-08-24 11:48:00,1970,"I for one perhapes along with others do like to make things if i can and see them work in the end , so heres a few pic's of one i started to make ..... its a replica of the home made ones found on the St Lawrance river in eastern Ontario....lol , for this one you need two plactic bottles , one larger pop bottle and one  doggy treat plastic jars , cut the end off the pop bottle carefuly with a good sharp some thing and cut the bottom end out of the plastic jar ,  then  you glue the neck of the pop bottle into the bottom of the plastic jar like a funnel going into it backwards , take the lid for the jar and drill it full of holes ........................in the end it should look like this..pic #3 , with plastic ties you then tie it to a peice of iron grill and fasten on a rope ....... good luck ."

724760,Billy Bob,2012-08-24 13:41:00,5865, I KNOW it's illegal for non-residents and I'm not talking for commercial purposes as this article refers to....but only to personal use WHILE your up there fishing.....BTW are we allowed to pick nightcrawler or is that also illegal for non-residents.....
