723876,craigdritchie,2012-08-20 14:42:00,1586,Catch and release is the responsible thing to do. But sometimes it doesn't work out as planned ........                    Oh dear .....
723877,Luke V.,2012-08-20 14:43:00,286,That guys heart must have stopped for a short second or two. What a rush that would have been
723885,tb4me,2012-08-20 15:02:00,3295,"Wow I had to look twice to be sure of what i was seeing..Thats a ""holy crap"" moment!"
723898,Musky or Specks,2012-08-20 15:45:00,2710,"You call it a holy crap moment I think its more of a ""bring me my brown pants"" moment"
723901,Snidley,2012-08-20 15:51:00,620,"That's a fairly common occurrence in both bill fishing and Tarpon fishing. Usually there's no photographer in the water to immortalize it though. It would be a momentary rush for the angler resuscitating the the Marlin and several minutes of panic for the photog that found himself in the water with a feeding Mako of that size. They are definitly ""biters"""
723903,GreenCanada,2012-08-20 15:55:00,375,"That's crazy, reminds me of this video  "
723906,DRIFTER_016,2012-08-20 15:57:00,10439,We had that happen with 140# tarpon at the side of the boat during the release. Get's the old blood pumpin' fer sure!!!!!
723909,Toad Hunter,2012-08-20 16:08:00,261,That guy likely needs to check his crap for underwear lol
723910,Gregoire,2012-08-20 16:15:00,1397,That is insane
723911,outllaw,2012-08-20 16:15:00,1232,alpha fish for sure them salt water muskies
723944,Christopheraaron,2012-08-20 17:48:00,3525,"Yikes! I actually feel bad for the angler and fish, never had a chance!"
723958,adolson,2012-08-20 18:45:00,783,"Not surprising, it was right in the strikezone."
723960,mirogak,2012-08-20 19:07:00,387,just wow ... but it almost seems as if they did it on purpose.  If the photographer had enough time to take all those pics from various elevations (depths rather) am sure there was enough time to release the (Tarpon) fish  so he could escape or fend for himself.
723961,Christopheraaron,2012-08-20 19:11:00,3525, That's a swordfish...
723965,mirogak,2012-08-20 19:30:00,387," Of course, I shouldn't have doubted myself.  I should know after watching all those shows on Discovery."
724030,Burtess,2012-08-20 22:02:00,901, Actually looks like a marlin to me (don't know what kind though   )  Burt
724032,Whitespinnerbait,2012-08-20 22:04:00,2038,How convenient !!......just so happen to be a camera vidoe taping = staged !!
724034,Roy,2012-08-20 22:10:00,13728,"Yes Paul, the attacking fish is a card carrying member of the actors guild. Do you know how long it took to train that shark? Not to mention the pay scale."
724064,craigdritchie,2012-08-21 00:12:00,1586,"It happens more often than you might think. That's the main reason you don't fool around when releasing a marlin (which this fish is, by the way). Same with tarpon - big hammerheads absolutely love them."
724108,Stoty,2012-08-21 02:49:00,2910," OMGGGGGGGG......   I agree, def looks like a Marlin"
724181,Rich,2012-08-21 16:16:00,3927,..... So they didn't release the shark? Looked like it took the bait just fine... Lol
724249,kickingfrog,2012-08-21 20:57:00,8333,At the risk of opening a can o worms: Any idea what type of shark that is?
724254,Roy,2012-08-21 21:20:00,13728, Yeah it's a mako. Here's the video version. http://link.brightcove.com/services/player/bcpid1278844113?bctid=793237666001
724265,craigdritchie,2012-08-21 22:25:00,1586,"Wow, I hadn't seen the video. Thanks for posting that Roy. I bet the video guy grew a few grey hairs over that incident."
