724221,Fisherman,2012-08-21 19:55:00,7201," Jedimaster to the rescue,  they were the middle ones I had."
724225,davey buoy,2012-08-21 20:07:00,5505,"How about some nice chair covers,but before scotch guard them and add a healthy dose of silicone spray. See where that takes you skip!!!!!!!!!!!. I know there in the cabin,but you never know when a side wind/rain get's at it?."
724232,Skipper D,2012-08-21 20:19:00,1970,Fisherman & jedimaster  ........  we just might be starting some thing here .. lol . Davey Bouy i got ya on that one .
723690,Skipper D,2012-08-19 19:34:00,1970,"So i go into Bass Pro the other day to price new captain seats for in the cabin of my  boat ...... four hundred bucks each , my hands trembled and i just could'nt seem to pull out my wallet ,  i head back for home thinking all the way theres got to be  cheaper way to put good seats in the boat  . Then the other night i had an idea on how this might be done and i hit the kijiji web site where theres so much to look at . This morning an email came back with a yes ..... we still have them .... , off i went and returned with thease  for fourty bucks each , hardly  used . After checking them over with minumal work the seats will switch over to the pedestals that are now in the boat . For the price i think  thease should be as comfortable  for awhile ."
723693,davey buoy,2012-08-19 19:41:00,5505," Look nice!!,are they water resistant at all?."
723694,misfish,2012-08-19 19:48:00,29133,"You picked up a nice charter boat,and want to cheap out?"
723696,Skipper D,2012-08-19 19:52:00,1970,  Hec i don't think so Dave but they are goining in the cabin where it should always be dry with glass windows all around and the fiberglass roof
723697,Skipper D,2012-08-19 19:55:00,1970,  I got to save as much coin as i can for the gas to run the dam thing Brian ...... lol .
723698,Skipper D,2012-08-19 19:59:00,1970,"Now the plan is to get a pair of vinyl ones the same to go out on the fishing deck ,"
723700,Woodsman,2012-08-19 20:17:00,1286,My concern is will the mountings survive the bouncing applied in rough water?
723701,misfish,2012-08-19 20:23:00,29133,"Hey Capt,,,,,,Turn it up,,,,,,,,,  "
723709,Skipper D,2012-08-19 20:51:00,1970,"  As you can see here Woodsman , you could mount them to the metal frame thats there or right to the wood that the bottom of the seat is made of , i suspect since the boat is quit lager it will never go that fast to give you a rough ride , atleast thats what i am thinking"
723710,Skipper D,2012-08-19 20:55:00,1970,"  Cool Brian ........  , but they don't swivle"
723712,Woodsman,2012-08-19 21:04:00,1286,I hope your right but I suspect neither the metal frame or wood thickness will be tough enough as that was never a design requirement.  Best Wishes: Rick
723714,aplumma,2012-08-19 21:15:00,6896,The framing and wood are not designed for the leaning or the pressure of the constant shifting of the weight of the person sitting in them. The fabric and the foam are designed for indoor use and will soon mold and tear. I would hold off on buying any more till these meet with your expectations. I run a 28ft cruiser and you will be surprised at the forces in play both running and when you are riding out the wake of other big boats. If the frames of the old seats are in good shape you can have them recovered and foamed for a reasonable price.   Art
723728,Pikeslayer,2012-08-19 22:00:00,1443,"Hey Skip, My trusty marine mechanic has a 36' salvage. From what I remember (after stripping some hardware), the cabin seats were in good shape. I'll go check them out for you this week and send some photos your way. They will either be really really cheap or free"
723743,jim,2012-08-19 22:49:00,124,"I used to have a Sportspal with 2 chevy astro van seats.  I caught bass out of this setup for over 8 yrs.  Looked like hell, but comfy as hell!!!!"
723745,davey buoy,2012-08-19 22:54:00,5505,"I think Ron's pretty handy,little more metal,bit of a weld,couple more screws,if the need arises."
723755,dave524,2012-08-19 23:25:00,4508,"I wonder how the fabric will hold up with UV exposure outdoors, some just disintegrate pretty quick."
723776,Billy Bob,2012-08-20 00:15:00,5865,If you can't afford a couple of these...    Then get make sure you have some room for a few of these... 
723834,Skipper D,2012-08-20 06:05:00,1970,"Wheather i am doing some thing conventional or unconventional with fishing or boats , i know this is one of the right places to come to and share an idea and get ideas . There are many smart minds here that are always willing to look out for ones best intrest and that i like . I thank every one for their inputs as they always do help funny or not .... lol . Thanks every one ."
724020,Sinker,2012-08-20 21:41:00,8692,"Just ask Beans or HTHM what happens when you use those kind of seats in a boat. I wouldn't use them, they won't last long in a boat. Your better to find some used proper boat seats. If you going to do it, do it right the first time!!  S."
724083,skeeter,2012-08-21 01:31:00,1907,"Hey skipper, where are the original seats? I know some one that will rebuild them pretty cheap."
724085,Skipper D,2012-08-21 01:48:00,1970,"Well to be honest Skeeter , the old ones i took out of the boat were swivle house chairs , they were still solidly mounted to the pedestals but did'nt look new any more"
724086,Skipper D,2012-08-21 01:54:00,1970,"Becuase of those seats is why i think i can get away with some good quality ones of the same put in their place , every new boat seat i looked at was so expensive for what they are made of ..... plastic and aluminum appossed to the ones i bought made of steel and wood , we'll see how long they last in time ........."
724135,krixxer,2012-08-21 10:58:00,274,buy a chair??  build a chair!!! you already have a 500 hour project; what's another week or two for woodwork?    p.s. don't forget my offer to help out with the paint  
724137,Skipper D,2012-08-21 11:21:00,1970,"  I have'nt forgot about you and your generious offer , i just have'nt had the time to get the boat back in the shop and get back at the sanding , been to busy with work coming in . I like those chairs their awsome , you don't know how long i looked at bar stools like that  ... every thing i saw you knew they would'nt stand up , they make 'em so cheap ,but i can see where some thing made like that would  ."
724190,Fisherman,2012-08-21 17:02:00,7201," Skipper, if you can find a pair of the old oak office chairs, maybe at the Restore in Barrie and give them a healthy dose of marine varnish, like Valspar.  I had one in my old boat, comfy, durable and with the side arms you can snooze and not list overboard.  No vinyl to get stuck to and no cheezy hinges to break."
