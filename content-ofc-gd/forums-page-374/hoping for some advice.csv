For walleye in stained, featureless water it's tough to beat a bright coloured worm harness trolled slowly on bottom, and maybe a bright jig head and chub/dace jigged vertically in locations that look that they hold numbers of fish tight together.  For shore fishing, maybe try slip floating a leech six inches to a foot off bottom and letting it go with the current.  I'd imagine that would catch just about everything."
