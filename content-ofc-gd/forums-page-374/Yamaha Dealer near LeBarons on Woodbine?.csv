723279,RangerGuy,2012-08-17 19:40:00,564,I'm looking to make an adjustment to my outboard hieght that doesn't require the long drive to my dealer. Wondering if anybody has dealt with this shop before. Please PM me your experiences either way  Thanks!
723280,GBW,2012-08-17 19:42:00,8460,Are you talking about CENTRAL OUTBOARD MARINE?  If it's a warranty thing just go.  Never been there but they have been around a LONG time.
723284,mike rousseau,2012-08-17 20:00:00,4661,"It's an easy job to do yourself... Especially if you know someone with an automotive engine lift...  Or you can use a ""come along"" and hang it from a tree...  Or if you can get 1 or 2 other buddies to help you can do It by hand...  I mounted my 50hp... Just me and a buddy...."
723289,RangerGuy,2012-08-17 20:20:00,564,"I can do it but.. it's 400lb motor and I""m nervous of dropping it LOL!"
723290,GBW,2012-08-17 20:26:00,8460,do you have a good 1/4 or 1/2 ton jack?  That with a block of wood on it will do the trick too.
723292,mike rousseau,2012-08-17 20:31:00,4661, Your 75 is 150 pounds heavier then my 50...wow would have never guessed that much
723293,mike rousseau,2012-08-17 20:31:00,4661,And as long as you only loosen the 2 bolts in the slotted section.... You cant drop it
723412,John Bacon,2012-08-18 05:38:00,3277,I bought my Princecraft there; they seemed fine to me.

724170,RangerGuy,2012-08-21 15:14:00,564,Talked to them the other day..they were very helpful.  Thank you everybody for the input
