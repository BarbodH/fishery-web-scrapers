724289,Rich,2012-08-22 01:50:00,3927,"Hit a local, overfished little pit north of me today, bass and pike on the agenda. Nothing going on, real tough all afternoon. A 12 inch largemouth and a lost topwater pike were all i had. We pull up to a point on the way back, i cast at it about 6 times and say ""i have no idea why the bass wouldnt be stacked behind that""... Make cast # 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 and catch a bass on every single one, ending with the main event, a 4 pounder. Couldn't get a freakin bite all day, fished that point already 4 other times, then when i say that, the fish woke up. Eerie! But im not complaining about that night one bit.    "
