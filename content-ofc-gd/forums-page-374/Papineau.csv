I got skunked in algonquin and I'm looking for redemption, I have my rod holder, a trolling rod and a line counter reel now (would dipsys work?), I don't care really what kind of trout it is (brookies would be nice). I've fished the lake for bass but never trout, I really have no clue what I'm doing so can someone give me an idea? Thanks."
