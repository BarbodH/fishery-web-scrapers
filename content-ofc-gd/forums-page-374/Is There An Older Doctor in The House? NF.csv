724403,bushart,2012-08-22 19:41:00,2628,Thought this was kinda cool  My wife was organizing some of her mother's things and happened upon this...  Now My Mother in law is 88 and this item was actually her Mother in law's (wifes grandmother)  Remembering this generation kept EVERYTHING!! including bent nails  I thought WOW  Check out the hours and the Doctor's name-----they lived in Hamilton and this was the wife's grandma's actual Doctor (Historical)  Gotta love the old bottle and cork  Very Cool  
724413,kickingfrog,2012-08-22 20:01:00,8333,Very cool. Likely 40 proof?  As to the office hours the Doctor was likely out making house calls during the day and maybe rounds at a hospital.
724414,bushart,2012-08-22 20:03:00,2628,I believe I was told the doctor did visit the homes
724416,Nemo,2012-08-22 20:06:00,727,You should keep that bottle...Dr. Elizabeth Bagshaw was a famous early female Dr. in Toronto and Hamilton.  Here is some background from the Canadian Medical Hall of Fame including a video.  http://www.cdnmedhall.org/dr-elizabeth-bagshaw
724418,kickingfrog,2012-08-22 20:15:00,8333,That is a very cool piece of history as well then.
724424,bushart,2012-08-22 20:46:00,2628,"Yes I was aware of her significance in the history books as one of Canada's 1st woman Doctor's  Kinda why I put that ""Historical"" in brackets above---think there's a school in Hamilton named after her??"
724430,fishnsled,2012-08-22 21:09:00,3520,Very cool and a great piece of history.
