723505,Leecher,2012-08-18 23:43:00,7832,"Well today, got some stuff done around the house and also found a ground blind for deer hunting that I had forgotten about    won this Propac Tent, 7 or 8 years ago when I was a member of a fishing & hunting club, had put it away somewhere in the basement and today stumble over it     It's going to be used this fall for sure  So after setting it up in the back yard, made this little video to simulate  the hunt   You must realize that in this few minutes of footage, I accelerated the process of what can be done to lure in a deer    In real mode, I only grunt 30 minutes after I'm settle in and continue to do so every 45 minutes there after.  The rattling can be used in late afternoon when deer in is the full rut and today was only able to get neighbors attention for my efforts    They thought I was nuts  Anyhoot here's the video and hope you enjoy!

Called and threw birds for my dog to retrieve. So I could teach her where to get in and out of the boat before moving to training on the water  LOL!"
