765378,Twocoda,2013-02-05 05:24:00,4130,I dont ice fish but a few of my buddies have been slaying the dink perch on the ice the past few days...
766444,BruceCfisher86,2013-02-09 04:29:00,49,Ive been wondering the same thing! I'm guessing the ice on Arron is alright now after this cold week! Have you fished Cameron much?
766550,hombres4,2013-02-09 22:44:00,10,Went to Arran this aft. Caugt some  small ones. Some slush on top but good ice underneath. Did not find the bite hot for us. PPl beside got a nice pike though.
