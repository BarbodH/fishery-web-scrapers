771148,misfish,2013-03-01 22:49:00,29133,"Heading down to the smoke in the morning. Have smoked meat to pick up,and fishing is in the plans,along with picking up a few fishing items. I want to get a Lowrance ice trasducer. From what I have seen online,West marine has the best price..  Another question,do  ice trasducers come with the floating foam,or does it just hang in the hole? That didnt sound right,but hey. Any help here would be nice. Thanks B"
771154,steelhedrmatt,2013-03-01 23:14:00,278,Got mine at radioworld. I think it was $90 for the ducer and the power cord together. Doesnt come with foam. I just used some pipe insulation and some zip ties.  Works great
