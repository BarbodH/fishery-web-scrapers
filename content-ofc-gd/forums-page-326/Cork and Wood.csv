769128,Spiel,2013-02-20 21:33:00,9065,Been swamped in work lately with many of my customers looking for new rods for the upcoming ice out steelhead season. Thought I'd share a few of the many handles I have on the go.      
769129,lew,2013-02-20 21:36:00,12766,Outstanding creations as always Chris !!
769132,misfish,2013-02-20 21:43:00,29133,"That top one looks like it was made just right,the way the lines flow out from the seat.So even.  I like the locking style rings.4 one down. Like you could use a key wrench to tighten them.  Nice work as always Chris. Now stop it,You know I want one,but will have to wait."
769136,kemper,2013-02-20 21:56:00,2232,Awesome!

769193,RDR,2013-02-21 00:18:00,125,"Good stuff Mister. That's right, I'm here"

769317,fishnsled,2013-02-21 16:38:00,3520,Very nice Chris!
769326,mercman,2013-02-21 17:26:00,7054,Artwork no doubt!  I love the third from the top. What kind of wood is that. Looks blue.
769334,TJQ,2013-02-21 18:12:00,7806,WOW!!!
769336,Roy,2013-02-21 18:21:00,13728," Paul, I believe Chris once said that it was big leaf maple dyed green."
769346,Spiel,2013-02-21 18:51:00,9065,"Thanks everyone, very much appreciated.   I do use that Roy but not this time, it's blue dyed Box Elder Burl.  To note I can't take credit for any of the wood work this time, it was all done by my good friend John Collina."
769348,mercman,2013-02-21 19:13:00,7054,
769349,Roy,2013-02-21 19:14:00,13728,"How ironic, Chris! It took the mere mention of maple to get you out of the woodwork!"
769351,grimsbylander,2013-02-21 19:31:00,3016,Beautiful craftsmanship!
769369,Spiel,2013-02-21 20:33:00,9065," Nice to see you finally posting here my friend (stalker), guess I've no where to hide now."
769374,RDR,2013-02-21 20:45:00,125,"Ya, that's me the ""Stalker""   You can't run! so there is nowhere to hide now  I just wanted to say ""Hi"" to all.  This is a great board, with an endless wealth of information  Rick"
770222,grimsbylander,2013-02-26 02:01:00,3016,"Hey Chris just wanted to thank you for fixing up my rod I shortened accidentally last fall. Great meeting you and spending an hour learning and seeing some of your craftsmanship. If anyone is wondering, those pictures don't do the rods justice. They're even more beautiful in person and feel amazing in your hand. Thanks again!! Dave"
770234,pidge,2013-02-26 02:30:00,438,"Jeeez nice talent, those look good Spiel. Pardon my ignorance, but do you sell these? I'm thinking of getting into some fly fishing this spring or summer, but the rod I got is a mighty old hand me down. Not that there's anything wrong with that, but thought I'd ask. I'm with Misfish, I like that black line in the grain on the top one. Nicely done once again."
770411,Ralph Field,2013-02-26 23:45:00,1018,Amazing handles ! You turn a mean reel seat.
770924,Spiel,2013-02-28 21:42:00,9065," You are very welcome Dave. It was nice to meet you and I'm happy I was able to fix you up.  You know where I'm at, don't be a stranger.    Yes Pidge, I do ( http://ontariofishingcommunity.com/forums/index.php?showtopic=62475 ). Kind of a hobby gone out of control.    Thank you but as I've mentioned before all (well almost all) of my seats are turned by friend JC."
