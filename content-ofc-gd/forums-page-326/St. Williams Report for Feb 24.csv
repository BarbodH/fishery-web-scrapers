Other buds that were with me caught 1 and I came up with this nice one. I caught it on 2 LB test and a Micro jig with a Gulp Maggot. Good job I had my gaff to get it up the hole. The ice was do-able, but I don't think it's going to last. Crack at shore we crossed no problem, just had to watch where you crossed. I took a plank down there but we didn't need it. But if anyone is going in the next few days be careful.  "
770040,Joey,2013-02-25 14:04:00,9122,"Wow, nice pike, and good warning to others about the crack/ice/shoreline!!!"
770041,asdve23rveavwa,2013-02-25 14:07:00,2690,"Nice pike for the bay!!  Actually, nice pike anywhere!"
770042,Roy,2013-02-25 14:13:00,13728,"A fine looking pike, Dave. On 2lb test eh? Your knots must be good too. Congrats."
770064,Spiel,2013-02-25 15:18:00,9065, Same knot that keeps is running shoes on Roy........
770267,chris.brock,2013-02-26 09:04:00,4053,"nice, healthy lookin' pike,  just checked- the line class record for 2 pound test for pike is almost 24lbs, crazy"
770327,Fish Farmer,2013-02-26 17:31:00,2234,"My Mom teached me good Thanks every one. That fish only made a short run and floated to the hole, good job I had my gaff with me because I don't think I could have got him up through a 6"" hole. Didn't fight much, must be because of the cold water or what ever. He came through like a bullet. Only in 4 1/2 FOW looked like it was 50 Lbs. looking down the hole. Fish was 34"" long"
