770434,Terry,2013-02-27 00:38:00,14456,don't know why you might have lost your cookies  go to bottom left and click on    Mark Community Read  them mark as read  then see if they stay read
770437,Roy,2013-02-27 00:42:00,13728,"Terry has the right answer. If there are threads that you skip over because you're not interested, they'll show up as unread (new content) unless you mark them as read or you mark that whole forum as read."
