This pile of parts along with some others that arrived earlier will soon become three custom sticks.  One for myself, one for an OFC member, and one for another angler.    And just for good measure, a steelhead.    It should be a fun weekend!"
770899,misfish,2013-02-28 20:25:00,29133,"Wish I had the room to do that. Im sure it,s a great satisfaction,to fish with your own creation.  Look forward to the finished builds Kemper..  Nice tease with steelhead.  Very soon, I hope to be on the river up here."
770909,kemper,2013-02-28 20:51:00,2232," For building multi-piece rods you really don't need all that much space. I used to build in my mother's kitchen - all you really need is a table!  It does help to have a fully detached, insulated, 40X30 workshop in the yard though  As for the steelhead, I had a little rod testing session the other day. That fish was one of 6 hookups in 8 consecutive drifts, a mind-blowing day indeed."
770923,DRIFTER_016,2013-02-28 21:42:00,10439,I have a pile of rod building stuff waiting for me to work on it but have been too busy.  Plus I need to make a new batch of floats too.
