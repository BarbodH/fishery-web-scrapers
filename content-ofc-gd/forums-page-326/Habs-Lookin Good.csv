768890,rmarentette,2013-02-19 22:12:00,124,I've been a Habs fan all my life and it's great to see they're doing good. I have a lot of friends who are Maple Leaf fans so I'm happy for them as well.

768988,lookinforwalleye,2013-02-20 02:49:00,4399,And the train keeps a rollin 
768994,nancur373,2013-02-20 02:59:00,1211,I don't mind losing to the leafs. seems we go on a 5 game winning streak right after every time.
769000,Leecher,2013-02-20 03:26:00,7832,It's a joy to see them at the top of the conference   Go HABS Go!!!
769002,ctranter,2013-02-20 03:32:00,543,"Buncha' red white and blue fairies,,, can't wait to hand this soft ""euro"" team another 6-0 LOSS.  Damn that felt sweet."

769007,nancur373,2013-02-20 03:44:00,1211,beat me to it
770782,darsky,2013-02-28 03:48:00,586,ok-its not the 6-0 beating they took last time but this sure looks like even to me.
770785,lookinforwalleye,2013-02-28 04:01:00,4399,Solid win....don't blame the leafs for being upset on that botched  faceoff that led to a goal. I hope the officials get all this faceoff Bull figured out before the playoffs!
771023,jbailey,2013-03-01 04:01:00,866,Celine Dion needs to stop pretending he's going to tussle. Even lecavalier and iginla are willing to drop the gloves once and awhile
771057,Squid,2013-03-01 15:16:00,1656,Phaneuf ( reads like puff cake and enough combined)   puff cake and air is all. Have to tell ya that the Leafs are a much improved team over last year. My wish is that they do FINALLY make the playoffs and meet Montreal in one of the rounds. That series would a memorable one for sure.
771173,nancur373,2013-03-02 00:13:00,1211,"bad move by the linesman for sure but how do they explain all the other goals? To quote a Canadian great....""Keep your stick on the ice"""
