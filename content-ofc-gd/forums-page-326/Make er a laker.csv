I tried to get out a few times last week but everytime I looked like I was heading out 50+ KM winds said 'no no no not today'.  So finally today after long last I get out. I had a few forum regulars mention a few lakes and a few people from work mention a few others for lake trout, but two weeks ago Chris K and I got a tip from a guy who owns a gas station and marina about a spot that was supposed to be really good...... I'm the type of person who overlooks logic and reason for insanity, so I decided to head there.  Set up off of a nice big island with a 40ft dropoff (I hear lake trout like that depth) and started fishing. In the first hour I hooked into about 4 or 5 (or maybe the same fish who was dumb enough to keep hitting my lure) and every time lost em, I got a great fight out of it each time but had yet to actually land my first ever trout. The last time I lost him the line snapped...... guess a 4lb fluro leader probablly wasn't the best idea.  After that, the day went silent for a few hours, I tried a few more places but had no luck. As darkness began to fall I decided to go back to my hot spot and make my last stand of the evening. I switched to something with a trebel hook too, no way was anything getting away.  Finally, I see something rocket off the bottom and whack my lure. As per the advice of Buick14 (who gives me ongoing fishing tips via text message) I let the trout munch on my offering for a minute before setting the hook.  After a great fight I finally landed one.    No world records being broken here, or even OFC records but it was my first ever landed trout at a whopping 14 inches.  I'm actually glad no one else was fishing with me because I actually did a little happy dance on the ice.  After that I had a few more hits and lost a few more but after getting tha monkey off my back I was really enjoying laker fishing. I love how they would come up off the bottom and just hammer the line, how a 14 inch fish faught like a 3 pound pike.  I hate to say it, but I might have to go out a few more times for lakers."
770470,dhickey,2013-02-27 03:05:00,1038,Good for you Looks like your on the right path. Nothing wrong with the happy dance I do it all the time..  
770479,BillM,2013-02-27 03:45:00,17367,Surprised that fish didn't get eaten by something bigger on the way up!
770486,Acountdeleted,2013-02-27 04:42:00,2562,"Thanks.   Yeah, buick told me that too. I can't get mad at him because he gives me tons of good advice, but he loves ripping on me too, these are how you determine your real friends.  :rofl2:"

770524,Rod Caster,2013-02-27 14:53:00,5784,"I feel you bud! 10 tens skunked-streak on a particular lake has finally been broken with a single 14 or 15 inch laker. I also did a happy dance, but two other guys watched me and said ""it's about time"". haha."
770593,Acountdeleted,2013-02-27 19:04:00,2562,Haha.  I just realized today I was about 2km away from the actual spot the old guy told us about. Not sure if this makes this a better story or a worse one.
770601,Acountdeleted,2013-02-27 19:55:00,2562,"What is this GPS you speak of? Lol I have one but the description I got was, the island that you can see closest to the road when you drive by. So, I stopped at the first island that I saw off of the road. Who knew there were 2? lol."
