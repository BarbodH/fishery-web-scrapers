770278,DoubleDigits,2013-02-26 13:44:00,140,"I fished all day yesterday in the BBP area, walking many miles and drilling many holes. Worked from 125' to 75' looking for a fish willing to actually bite. As the skunk wore on into the afternoon I decided to play with the camera a bit, and set it on the snow to film myself drilling a hole...the only time I turned on the camera all day, and the only time I needed to.   Thanks for looking!"
