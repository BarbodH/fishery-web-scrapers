770663,Roy,2013-02-28 00:06:00,13728,I have been looking at this stuff for a while. I thought that some of you who fish uncharted waters might be interested in the concept. Here's a short video on how it's done.
770668,Rod Caster,2013-02-28 00:17:00,5784,"Love this idea! My only question is, do they need any product testers? Highly doubt I could afford or would spend this much on equipment this good.  I guess I'll continue using bottom bouncers and brain memory for my uncharted lakes."
770669,BillM,2013-02-28 00:19:00,17367,"Sounds  a lot like Dr.Depth which has been around for a bit.  Also, I hope Humminbird comes up with something cool like this!  LOL!  I wonder what happens to that sonar data?  Do they sell it?  Upload it for all to use?  I'd hate to upload a file I created for a lake that doesn't have depth charts and have it available to anyone/everyone for a fee."
770700,WildPointer,2013-02-28 01:29:00,3,Here is a Insight FAQ that provides additional information;  http://insightstore.lowrance.com/coming_soon/insight_genesis_faq.pdf  I personally don't like the fact that you need to connect to their Web Server to transfer and translate your data. And the subscription scheme looks scary.  The Dr Depth software appears to be a one time software license that resides on your computer and gives you a standalone system. ( No Web service when your in a remote location and want to create a map ).Here is a link providing some additional info.  http://www.hightechfishing.com/drdepth-1.html  I don't' personally have any experience but I'm interested in hearing more opinions on this thread !
770718,BillM,2013-02-28 01:55:00,17367,Humminbird must have something behind the scenes that does something similar.   Let's hope they reveal it soon.
770738,irishfield,2013-02-28 02:07:00,26272," I wish... that my 112C would do just that and correct all the charting errors as we go along, from data provided by two drunks in a row boat in the late 1800's, with a length of rope and a weight. Find three 100 foot spots and draw an oval! What.. we missed a 19 foot mountain in between, or well what's a downrigger?? !!.. and how hung up can 4 sharks really get?"
770774,BillM,2013-02-28 03:26:00,17367, To who?  Aliens?!?!?!??!?!??!?
770777,BillM,2013-02-28 03:37:00,17367,............that was supposed to be a secret.
770791,hotsky,2013-02-28 04:40:00,400,Why? If thats the case you'd benefit from someone elses data too.
770796,adempsey,2013-02-28 05:23:00,1498,"It's pretty cool.  I'd use it if I owned a Lowrance and it was free or almost free.  Oh, I'd need a boat too, lol!"
770798,Steve Piggott,2013-02-28 06:38:00,196,I just pick up the 9HDS touch .coolest thing i have seen .Check out the video on you tube .
770802,lew,2013-02-28 10:29:00,12766,"Thanks for that Roy, some interesting stuff there."
770818,Fish Farmer,2013-02-28 13:51:00,2234,"Thanks Roy, very interesting. What will they think of next. Bought a new machine last year and It's out of date already."
770819,GbayGiant,2013-02-28 13:59:00,1780,Nice to see the best make in units comes up with a key app like this one. I am sure the cheaper units(hummingbird) will come out with it soon .
770825,BillM,2013-02-28 14:43:00,17367,"I hope Lowrance pays you post stuff like that, lol."
770831,Angler management,2013-02-28 15:32:00,280,The new lowrance real rime structure mapping is amazing! My new favorite feature. Amazing detail thanx to structure scan!
770989,Steve Piggott,2013-03-01 01:39:00,196,Think of all the mapping info they have to sell later ..Its like google cars mapping all the roads
770995,BillM,2013-03-01 01:59:00,17367," This is the best part..  You pay for everything, upload the maps and they re-sell for a profit..  That's why I like programs like Dr.Depth, do it yourself and it's all yours.. No uploading to any central servers, etc."
771016,Angler management,2013-03-01 02:59:00,280,"If i can just buy everything already mapped, i would be able to spend a lot more time fishing then finding ideal structure to fish. And if i can help map uncharted areas, great! Im sure there would be a ton of thankful people such as myself."
771019,BillM,2013-03-01 03:12:00,17367," I'll keep my favourite spots to myself, lol."
