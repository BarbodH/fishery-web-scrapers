770439,Moosebunk,2013-02-27 00:48:00,3970,"POSSESSED BY THE GREY.    Arrived to Lake Lakerstone Lake.  Off-loaded zeee quads, got riding.  A stiff, cold wind did blow.  I was quick into a warm Clam.  Had a fishy hunch, my fingers and toes crossed.  They did not make for a long wait... long.  First came a goodunâ€™.  GLORY!!! GLORY!!!  But suddenly a blinding flash!!!    Then cast into a darkness... and a new dimension.  Evil set in.     Upon frozen white.  A Wizard from inside a nearby lair stirred.  I called out.  ""FISH ON!"" he summoned...  Boot-scoot boogied to him.    Waving a magic wand he had awoken a demon laketrout from Middle Earth.  Vile, defiant... and greasy.  Nearing the portal, dorsal fin hooked.  No way to head, no way to tail.  Five pounder... (give or take five pounds)  GONE!!!  Vile, defiant... greasy.  The loob toobs are bad, and winning.  They could see into my soul now.    Fighting back, one laker, then another.  Midget Mackinaw Mayhem!!!  Too many, too cold, too angry...  The darkside taking over.    By the Rod of St. Croix.  Strength of Mitchell.  Power of Pro!  and stealth of Drennan.  Defeated by the evil Greys was I was.  Now possessed.  Imprisoned.    Years come to pass... new days dawn.  At times the walls of the laker prison did whisper...  ""One drop of our drool will free you, you fool.""  Rock hammer, poster, Bible, time, pressure... and hope.  Do the math Andy.  Drool.    Could feel my senses returning.  The Force.  More laker drool.  Road trips...  Bike or hike.  Drill ice... Repeat.  Gotta git me some drool!!!    With every vile, defiant, greaser slayed...  By the Power of many GreySkulls.  Trap Jaw Mackinaw, Beastor, MerMan, Skelakor...  Comin' fo' yaz!!!  I have the power.        ""WHO IS YOUR GREY LEADER?"" I demand to know.    ""Defeated Grey Lake Trout Mackinaw speak to me!!!""    ... ""you seek at eighty fathoms, Ahura... and Angra... the twins...""  (sigh... then death)  (whistle tweet tweet)  Trusty steed speed arrives.    Hi-Ho Outlander... AWAY!!!  AHURA!!!  Militant Mackinaw Scumlord.    Gunned down.    ANGRA!!!  Psycho Killaker... (qu' est-ce que c'est?)    Death by hanging.    Bunk...  Returned to Lake Lakerstone Lake... still possessed but not as bad.  Purple Heart for bravery and a world of colour again.  Unlimited scotch and beef jerky for life!  ... and all the free and easy women a Champion could ever want.    The End."
