770936,kickingfrog,2013-02-28 22:50:00,8333,Sail by Awol Nation. It's now used in a bmw commercial.
770937,grimsbylander,2013-02-28 22:52:00,3016,Sail by Awolnation. Great tune.  Beat out by the dreaded Kickingfrog!! LOL
770938,misfish,2013-02-28 22:54:00,29133,"Yup,thats the brain burning commercial that caught me.Hook line and sinker"
770939,kickingfrog,2013-02-28 22:57:00,8333,First time I heard it was on another wing-suit video. I'm not up for those types of thrills but that wing-suit might just be the most fun a person can have with their clothes on.
770940,irishfield,2013-02-28 22:59:00,26272,You're assuming they're wearing clothes Rob.. most would only be wearing a diaper under that suit!
770941,4x4bassin,2013-02-28 23:15:00,1025,"That is some crazy video , thanks"
770945,Christopheraaron,2013-02-28 23:23:00,3525,"Every time I see those guys I wonder, how do you get started in that sport? You couldn't just jump off a cliff and expect to live with no experience..."
770946,spincast,2013-02-28 23:25:00,3279,"so, how come they dont show the landing?"
770953,Roy,2013-02-28 23:48:00,13728,They do show the landing.
770954,Roy,2013-03-01 00:02:00,13728,Here's the landing here. That dude is spooky at the end.
770956,Locnar,2013-03-01 00:16:00,645,Sail should use this song in a commercial.
770962,kickingfrog,2013-03-01 00:22:00,8333,"I started by jumping off my bed.  Then from progressively higher up the stairs.  Next, my older cousin said to jump out the second floor bedroom window with superman cape. And that is where my cliff jumping career ended."
770964,kickingfrog,2013-03-01 00:28:00,8333,"In all seriousness, a lot of these people have extensive parachuting experience. It is a little easier to learn to fly from a plane then a cliff I guess."
770965,Roy,2013-03-01 00:30:00,13728,Sail will need all the help they can get.
770966,Christopheraaron,2013-03-01 00:30:00,3525,"  LMAO!  And true, I guess you would start with a plane over water."
770968,kickingfrog,2013-03-01 00:34:00,8333,They use a parachute to land I believe.
770969,spincast,2013-03-01 00:34:00,3279,"ah, parachute - I was trying to visualise - belly flop, or running with those webbed legs - either way would have been a tad ouch.... somehow I suspect the interview with the life insurance sale guy is somewhat abreviated"
770971,Roy,2013-03-01 00:39:00,13728,"With that one video alone, he can probably insure himself without the loan sharking companies."
770975,kickingfrog,2013-03-01 01:00:00,8333,I think we may now know where they get their start:  http://ca.shine.yahoo.com/blogs/parenting/needs-sleep-toddler-practices-face-plants-parents-watch-183900590.html
771025,hotsky,2013-03-01 04:55:00,400,If you watch some of his other videos he said he was suisidal form like 7 to 18 and when he started he didn't care if he died...explains a lot. Still probably the coolest thing one can do.
771032,ckrb2007,2013-03-01 09:16:00,449,"I guess you guys haven't seen the video of that Jeb guy and another guy trying to get close to a bridge while using those wing suits. Needless to say, Jeb is the only one who lands in one piece. Just youtube ""guy hits bridge in wingsuit""."
771047,wallacio,2013-03-01 14:17:00,475,"Corliss almost died himself last year.  Warning, the video is a bit graphic.  "
