770685,fishnsled,2013-02-28 00:59:00,3520,A buddy of mine is looking to do a drive-in fishing trip with his son.  He is looking at these two camps and was wondering if I had any input on them.  Since I've never been to either perhaps some one here has.  The camps he was looking at are Lake Sasseginaga in Quebec or Island Lake Lodge just north of North Bay.  http://www.islandlakecamp.com/  Any other suggestions are more than welcome.  Thanks!
