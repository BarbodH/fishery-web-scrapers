The new 1/3rd the size of the old ballasts have a black,white,two blues and one white. The one red I can do,the two blues?.The ballast shows two reds to the single red.Two blues to the two blues which I don't have two.Any ideas.? The ballast says 120/220.so I belive it should be able to be used for this application.It also mentions F96T12 on the ballast. Not sure if one blue or two should be connected to the blue wire?.Any help would be appreciated for sure. Thanks."
