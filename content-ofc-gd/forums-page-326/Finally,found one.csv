770277,motv8tr,2013-02-26 13:23:00,2587,"Very nice Brian, clearly hard work and determination pay off...a little luck along the way doesn't hurt either  Maureen"
770280,Lunkerhunter,2013-02-26 13:57:00,455,a buddy of mine said to me that said he dropped a camera down and saw dead whities on the bottom of the lake in a few different locations? anybody else seen this? i wonder if this is why no one is catching them.
770284,misfish,2013-02-26 14:21:00,29133,"So far,it,s hear say. I have yet to see any video around that proves it,but ya,thats the word. VHS."
770310,bassjnkie,2013-02-26 15:57:00,1101,Well done Brian!!
770331,Fish Farmer,2013-02-26 17:46:00,2234,"HMMMMMMM close to home ey. See if I can talk Spieler into some reel fishin. Did 2 dry runs so far Brian, 9th. line and BBP, Nutin."
769886,misfish,2013-02-24 17:08:00,29133,"Their not all dead after all.Well this one is now.LOL  Didnt feel like treking out on the big lake, so stayed close to home and try for perch.  SURPRISE    26.5 INCHS FOR TEAM 7. Caught on an old nils master I have been looking the last month for.     "
769900,davey buoy,2013-02-24 18:03:00,5505,"Way to go Brian,looks as though the Whities may of just changed locations this year?."
769906,Terry,2013-02-24 18:15:00,14456,what is that a herring?   lol   nice going
769913,kickingfrog,2013-02-24 18:44:00,8333,Nice!  You can get the odd one in that area but certainly other areas are more productive. On a side note I've never caught or heard of someone catching a laker there.
769915,misfish,2013-02-24 18:45:00,29133,
769946,NAW,2013-02-24 22:33:00,4022,Right on Brian..  We went today and got skunked on white fish.

769969,moxie,2013-02-25 00:33:00,1566,Nice. Good to see them swimming around. Except for that one. hehehe.
770035,RickOnt,2013-02-25 13:46:00,669,"Good on Ya Brian  They are definitly scattered around this year.  You get one and think OK we are on to something, Go back the next day and NADA  When the Wife asks about the Fishing, I say 'Fishing' was great but the 'Catching' was not so good  Rick"
770038,Joey,2013-02-25 14:00:00,9122,"Way to go B.  Finding them is great, catching them is even better"
770050,darsky,2013-02-25 14:40:00,586,did ya have to punch it in the nose so hard???
770076,misfish,2013-02-25 16:42:00,29133," Blind bud. Transducer is pooched.     It would hold still for it,s picture.LOL    I missed another good solid hit about an hour after that one,then nothing the rest of the morning.  Thanks guys and gal."
770096,kickingfrog,2013-02-25 19:02:00,8333,Is it just the transducer? and is it a hummingbird?
770106,misfish,2013-02-25 19:49:00,29133,"It,s a Lawrance,and Terrys transducer worked on mine."
770108,kickingfrog,2013-02-25 19:59:00,8333,Then my spare humminbird would be of no use to you.
770129,misfish,2013-02-25 20:55:00,29133, Thanks for the offer Rob.
770145,dhickey,2013-02-25 21:16:00,1038,Verry nice. All I got were more stinking perch and sore legs.. But my daughter and I had a great time so mayby next time she will get one?  Well done.
770155,DRIFTER_016,2013-02-25 21:40:00,10439,"AHHHHHHHHHHH, the ultra rare Lake Simcoe Unicorn!!!!"
