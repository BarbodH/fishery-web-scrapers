770475,Freshtrax,2013-02-27 03:30:00,2215,"Just pulled the trigger on a new truck, 07 sierra 4x4 crew cab 4.8L  its got 200k on it but i got killer deal on it and its like new condition. any one own one?  anything to look for?   how do you like it?  here she is i worked out a deal to get some new  285/70/17 m/t tires thown in and im gonna put a 2 inch front  leveling kit on it.  now i just need to find some centercaps. Any idea what these wheels are off?  It has nice  snow tires on all four corners right now, seemed weird.   "
770478,Angler management,2013-02-27 03:44:00,280,"I have an 05 model, never once had an issue with the truck... Knock on wood.... Best truck i have ever owned! I get mine rust sprayed every year from crown because they tend to have rocker panel decay, its important to get it drilled and sprayed with oil on the inside of the panel. Will give u way more life on the truck. I hear they had some issues with the push button 4x4 unlike floor shift. And very important to get your diff. serviced regularly because its the main cause of expensive repair. Also the tranny tends to give out around 200 000- 250 000km. Other then that the trucks seem to run forever. The 5.3L has a little bit better reputation and fuel economy(highway and towing). But i have a friend with an 02 with half million km on it and still running mint."
770503,barrystrs,2013-02-27 13:07:00,75,"They look like denali rims.  It may have come from QC if it has snows, but does it matter?  Looks great.  My truck came with all season tires and I always wanted big wide tires, now I have them, and although it looks good, corners and handles better, it definately rides rougher and is lousy in the snow."
770516,Luke V.,2013-02-27 13:55:00,286,"Father in law had an 08 with the 4.8L. Pretty good on gas. Nice truck, just not enough power for towing larger trailers. Swapped it in for a 2010 crew can with the 5.3 and towing package. Identically the same truck just newer and different engine. Makes a big difference when hauling bigger trailers. I wouldn't be too worried about the mileage. Have the tranny flushed/coolant flushed and check the gear oil in the diffs and transfer case an that truck will last another 200k"
770539,ecmilley,2013-02-27 15:44:00,2163,"decent trucks, good engine and great on fuel better than all other v-8's and most V6's if your towing much more than a 18ft bass fibreglass bass boat you'll notice it back there though its rated to tow around 6700lbs. the wheels look to be american racing or fast wheels, take off a rim and see if there is some kind of stamping on it.  As for the leveling kits or torsion bar keys I'll keep it simple either spend the money on a proper lift kit that comes with everything you need at around $2400 or don't bother, The factory alignment adjustment cannot compensate for the additional height the keys produce and you end up driving around with -1.50 -1.75 degree of negative camber kills handling and ride as well as eats the inside of the tires"
770556,mr blizzard,2013-02-27 16:53:00,1589,"A  friend of  mine back east has the exact truck and loves it, we have an 05 with a 5.3, were getting 28 mpg on our fishing runs from Barrie up to Manitoulin on cruise.  What we were told as previously mentioned check diffs fairly regular and u should be fine. Also we were cautioned not to use the 4 auto.  We just use the switches that let u go from 2 to 4 on your own.  Even after 2 years up here it has been amazing.  THE only problem we have encountered is that the driver door will not totally shut at -50 windchill LOL . You will enjoy your new addition trust me. Now go take it for another spin around the block, just dont get it dirty lol"
770649,pidge,2013-02-27 22:59:00,438,"Nice truck man, looks great in the pics for having 200,000 on her. Im with Barrystrs. I to think those are Caddy Escalade, or GMC Denali rims."
770664,Crazy Ivan,2013-02-28 00:10:00,184,"I bought my truck from the same place 3 years ago. Came with snow tires as well, truck was from Quebec. Mandatory to have snows there I think. No problems so far, they must have some connection with that province."
770757,nancur373,2013-02-28 02:40:00,1211,nice truck.
770817,Old Ironmaker,2013-02-28 13:46:00,8243,"I put my 90 GMC 1500  Sierra to rest at 600,000 K. Traded it in on a new 2011 Silverado 1500, 4.8L. I believe the only thing different between your truck and mine are the Caddy wheels, name tags and 4 wheel drive pushbutton shifter. You will be happy you bought it. My F150 buddies ask to see under the hood, I tell them I don't know how to open it, never had to!"
770821,lew,2013-02-28 14:08:00,12766," 600,000 KM and you never cleaned the engine, checked the engine or tranny fluid or even added windshield washer fluid ??"
770823,Old Ironmaker,2013-02-28 14:24:00,8243,"It's a tongue in cheek joke IA, of course maintenance is key, I only tell that to Ford owners, i.e. GM's don't need maintenance."
770824,Old Ironmaker,2013-02-28 14:25:00,8243,"Oops, see you have a Ford. I meant Chrysler owners."
770846,lew,2013-02-28 16:12:00,12766," I was just having some fun with ya, guess it didn't come out right"
770851,mike rousseau,2013-02-28 16:27:00,4661,Really???  That's 10 mpg more then the consumption numbers listed online.... And I'm giving benifit of the doubt that you have 2wd....  Thats almost double what my F-150 gets on average....
770863,BillM,2013-02-28 17:20:00,17367, That's most likely Imperial..   23MPG US isn't very far fetched for that truck.
770869,ch312,2013-02-28 17:48:00,1590," ...and better MPG than the same truck in regular cab, 2 wd, 4.3l gets.  meh, we're all fishermen here. exaggeration is to be expected  :D    on that note, what V8 currently has the best real world MPG?"
770871,Angler management,2013-02-28 17:55:00,280,I get 14L/100km average on my 05 5.3L and i have the rare aluminum block L:33 motor which is better on fuel...
770872,irishfield,2013-02-28 17:59:00,26272,"Look like '03 Denali rims.. as newer ones have 8 spokes. Funny they're satin vs polished though so maybe aftermarket. Guess they ""grab"" them so quick in Quebec they forget to pick up the center caps....  Good luck with YOUR new ride!"
770888,Freshtrax,2013-02-28 19:33:00,2215,I got the car fax never reported stolen lol
770889,BillM,2013-02-28 19:33:00,17367,"Similar to the Denali rims, but I'm fairly certain they never came in a satin finish.  I'm willing to bet those are aftermarket."
770914,irishfield,2013-02-28 21:09:00,26272,What Bill.. just copying my posts? LMAO !
770932,ecmilley,2013-02-28 22:40:00,2163,"like I said, aftermarket rims , fast wheel, macpek american racing couple others as well that are big in quebec for the snow tires and rims start researching, or just buy some new rims"
770934,BillM,2013-02-28 22:46:00,17367, There must have been a telekinetic link between our brains when we both replied!
