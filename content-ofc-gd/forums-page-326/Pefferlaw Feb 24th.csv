770025,turtle,2013-02-25 11:53:00,274,"I walked out yesterday for perch.  The good-lot's of ice, the entire handle of a metal scoop I'd say 18 inches everwhere and walking is not difficult, futher you go out less snow but enough so didnt need cleats.  Not so good-marked lot's of fish in every hole, tough bite especially in the am, caught maybe 60-70 fish all day from maybe 4 inches to 3 that were 9 inches.  Didnt keep any.  I walked out past the tip of Roches Point maybe 2.5 km from shore-same result small fish everywhere. I caught the 3 bigger fish in 17 FOW but was in 25-30 FOW most of the day."
