770930,HTHM,2013-02-28 22:34:00,4082,Then it would have to be wired into your leg to control direction. They are not quite there yet.
770972,Angler management,2013-03-01 00:44:00,280,"Lol. I realize that, thats why i said i wish they would figure out a way...  I guess it would have to be a hydraulic/electric system to make it work in a similar way."
770665,iFish4real,2013-02-28 00:15:00,386,"I'm thinking about getting a new Hummingbird for my boat. Has anybody used the new ones with Side Imaging® / Down Imaging® features (898c HD SI Combo) ? Are they worth the money or I should just go for a regular DualBeam one (858c HD XD Combo) ?  Much appreciated, thankx!!! "
770678,BillM,2013-02-28 00:34:00,17367,"Side Imaging is killer, my next sonar will be a HD SI unit for sure."
770778,trapshooter,2013-02-28 03:39:00,1234,"I have that exact unit, 898 HD SI.  Two thumbs up.  Once you play around with the SI for a bit you'll rely on it more and more.  Great tool."
770787,young_one,2013-02-28 04:15:00,620,http://radioworld.ca/998c-combo-p-7326.html not a bad deal.
770793,JustinHoffman,2013-02-28 04:49:00,482,"I have a Humminbird 798 ci HD Side and Down Imaging unit at the back of the boat. LOVE IT! Like Ben mentioned, the side imaging is invaluable once you learn to read it and adjust the settings. I actually use the Down Imaging more than the regular sonar - the detail is incredible.  Good Fishing, Justin"
770809,iFish4real,2013-02-28 13:00:00,386,"thanks guys, now I know what I'm getting"
770810,Joey,2013-02-28 13:21:00,9122,"We have that exact unit and love it.  I see it is the same price it was years ago, so it must not be losing any value"
770812,Angler management,2013-02-28 13:24:00,280,Why is nobody talking about the new hds7? Its twice the unit....
770814,BillM,2013-02-28 13:31:00,17367, Compared to what?
770826,iFish4real,2013-02-28 14:46:00,386,"there's one on ebay for $1,297.99..."
770836,Angler management,2013-02-28 15:48:00,280,All of the humming bird units... (98c) models
770839,BillM,2013-02-28 15:53:00,17367, Shouldn't you be comparing the HDS7 to the HD SI/DI models?
770844,Angler management,2013-02-28 16:07:00,280,No because the hd di si is optional on the lowrance units and sold seperately.
770848,BillM,2013-02-28 16:15:00,17367, So what does the normal HDS7 have over the Non-HD Humminbird systems?
770852,Angler management,2013-02-28 16:27:00,280,"From what i heard from semi pro friends, quite a bit more sophisticated... But personally i love the fact that i can buy the unit this year for cheap, and add all the fancy goodies as i can afford later on."
770857,BillM,2013-02-28 17:03:00,17367," Comparing these two is like Ford vs GM..     One thing I've heard is that customer service from Humminbird far out does that of Lowrance..  As for the HDS7, you can get a 858c HD for $50 less at BassPro..  I've also read about the menu system on the Humminbird being quite a bit easier to use.   I'll be in the market for a updated sonar this year (Currently have a 788ci), I'm thinking 898 HD SI or a 958, can't make my mind up!"
770859,iFish4real,2013-02-28 17:14:00,386,"well, the 958 doesn't have the side imaging, from what I hear here that's the best feature Humminbird has. It's abt $200 less, that's true"
770862,BillM,2013-02-28 17:17:00,17367,"Ah yes, only DI on the 958..  I'll most likely stick with the 898!"
770868,Angler management,2013-02-28 17:47:00,280,"I am not familiar with both units enough to give u exact details that set them apart, but having a friend who is sponsored by Hummingbird, and buys a new hds for his personal ranger bassboat tells me a lot."
770881,BillM,2013-02-28 18:43:00,17367," Like I said, I don't think you can go wrong with either..   All personal preference.   There definitely is no outright winner with either brand."
770884,jedimaster,2013-02-28 19:09:00,3472,If I was sponsored by humminbird I would buy a humminbird as well..... just sayin.
770886,Dan668,2013-02-28 19:31:00,1120,"Id go for the Si unit. Used Si all last year, awesome. I own Lowrance HDS units though, all have their similarities. A friend that i fish with uses the 998 si, great unit. All about personal preference."
770904,John Bacon,2013-02-28 20:42:00,3277," The way I read the post, his friend is sponsored by Humminbird but bought a Lowrance for his personal boat."
770911,MrSimon,2013-02-28 20:56:00,217,"Another 898 HD SI owner here.  Love it.  Also, only Humminbird units are compatible with the Minn Kota iPilot system.  Maybe that matters to you and maybe it doesn't .... but my HB 898 / Terrova iPilot combo as literally changed my life"
770913,Angler management,2013-02-28 21:05:00,280,"I love the idea of ipilot, but the motors that are compatible are all electronic wire driven as opposed to cable driven. Bass anglers nightmare when cutting through thick weeds. I wish they would have somehow made it compatible with the $2000 fortrexx motor i bought last year."
