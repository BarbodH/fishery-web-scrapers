770536,Lunker777,2013-02-27 15:34:00,866,I saw that video last week.  There isn't much to be said that hasn't already been said many times over the last bunch of years. The only way I can make myself feel better is to KNOW I do my part in keeping things clean.  I need to get more serious about recycling. I know I can do that

There are beaches, throughout the world, covered in plastics to a depth of over a foot. Despite knowing all this there has been no real effort to deal with the complex trash problem. Midway is only another symptom. Truth is the problem will not go away because no one wants to foot the bill."
