I really enjoy the small town events around Minden like the demolition derby, the ice car racing and the ATV Mud Bog competition to name a few. Really friendly people.  Getting stuff organized the night before.    I was riding over before the sun came up to secure our spot on the lake, there's another group that also likes this spot.    Lots of soft snow and slush on the lake for the 140 that came out.    We only had 2 bites all morning. My Dad missed a fish after I caught this 3.2 lber.    The prizes and draws etc, in the slush    Lots of great prizes donated by local companies    I took third place and a new Rapala power auger. You'll likely see it soon in the classified section because we already have a solid auger. Another fun day up in cottage country. Me, my Dad and his friend Ed.  "
769956,Christopheraaron,2013-02-24 23:30:00,3525,Well done! Looks like a fun day
769959,mattyk,2013-02-24 23:43:00,2110,"Cool, looks like some good times! Congrats on the 3rd place finish!"
769965,Burtess,2013-02-25 00:14:00,901,Good job on the third place win!  Looks like Miskwabi?  I guess a lot of the lakes in that area look the same from those angles lol...  Burt
769971,moxie,2013-02-25 00:36:00,1566,Congrats Chris. Can't say I'm sad to see Old Man Winter loosening his grip though.
769990,pidge,2013-02-25 01:38:00,438,"Nice stuff man congrats on the third place. Never fished Pidgeon ever, but that looks like a good tourney. Is it reasonable to walk out or is a snow machine required?"
769997,chris.brock,2013-02-25 02:19:00,4053," Haliburton looks pretty similar, not Miskwabi though, N. Pigeon on Deep Bay Rd   yeah, spring's around the corner, maple trees will be flowing soon   it's a small lake and easy to walk out, lots of people fishing just off the public launch today"
770087,jimmer,2013-02-25 17:54:00,2730,Nice fish. I have never caught one that big out of there.

770198,mcdougy,2013-02-26 00:23:00,274,Good one!!! How big was the 1st place fish? And what did he chose to haul home?
770236,Slayingm,2013-02-26 02:33:00,204,Great job and congrats on 3rd!  Have fished N. Pigeon a few times over the years and always 1st ice and down very well... good to see it still producing and later in the season!
770256,Leecher,2013-02-26 03:54:00,7832,Awesome Chris!!!  Congrats on your third place finish   Sweet prize for your efforts
770265,chris.brock,2013-02-26 08:52:00,4053," 1st was 3.6lbs, $500 prize 2nd was 3.5lbs, $300  I choose the auger over a $200 cash prize  I talked to the CO a few years ago and he said the odd 10 lber is caught out of N. Pigeon"
770316,jimmer,2013-02-26 16:41:00,2730,I always have a tough time on that lake after the end of January.
