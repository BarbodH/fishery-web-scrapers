770426,moxie,2013-02-27 00:27:00,1566,  You say it like we've had these technological assets since the beginning of time. Disposable world Sin. I thought engineers were supposed to be practical and not get sucked in like us common folk.
770431,Luke V.,2013-02-27 00:35:00,286,"Engineers are practical. We aren't getting sucked in Maybe you have forgotten that engineers are involved in making this cutting edge technology that u take advantage of everyday. Most engineers are very practical. If you chop wood by hand to light your common folk fire, but had access to a splitter why not use the splitter. It always has made sense to me to seek the simplest and most effective solution to every problem. That's what makes engineering so much fun and enjoyable. It's striving everyday to come up with a solution to many many complex problems. Engineers are not sucked into anything. They are the ones creating the next best thing everyday."
770445,danc,2013-02-27 01:17:00,4677,"Y'now. I used to be known as the ""have the latest and greatest"" electronic guy amongst my friends. I just had to have the latest and greatest of all tech things new. I probably spent 5 grand on point and shoot cameras before I spent another x grand on DSLR's. Was the first to have an HDTV. Upgraded my computer to the max yearly. But I've backed off. I got a Blackberry two years ago. Right when the I phone was taking over. Big deal. So now I get my email on demand for 15 bucks a month. My apprentice walks 50 feet behind me with his face burried in his I phone all day long. Haven't told him yet, but he's laid off this Friday because of this. He's had many warnings. Do they still make flip open phones, where all that they do is make phone calls, and perhaps take a few crappy pics if needed? That's what I want. I'm on the net 24/7 after work. And yes, there's plenty of times I need it at work. But it isn't difficult to find a connection, or phone the office to get the info that I need within minutes. I still like my high tech stuff, but I can live without a wonder phone. I doubt if I'll ever own one."
770538,blaque,2013-02-27 15:37:00,2419,"I was all gung-ho to get a waterproof case when i first got my smartphone.......the desire has since faded. I just got my first smartphone about a year and a half ago......and the honeymoon stage has run its course. I admit, i was connected to this thing at the hip but its slowly becoming less of a distraction.  Having said that, I can openly admit that i wouldnt want to go without one from here on out. Its like when i made the switch from cars to pick-up trucks, ohhhhh 17 years ago or so........i can never drive a car again!!"
770588,bare foot wader,2013-02-27 18:39:00,1354,"I have a lifeproof case, it does work well (waterproof and shock protection), the fellow that dunked his i the saugeen either didn't have it sealed correctly or the battery charger flap was open....also need to be careful you don't damage the seal on the screen when installing/removing the phone  regardless of what somebody's personal opinion is on need vs wants of electronic devices, why wouldn't you want to protect your investment? just because something is disposable doesn't mean i don't care when i ruin it or how often I replace it...i use a single disposable razer cartridge at least 6 months before i chuck it LOL a box of them is 15 bucks  I use that navionics app on my iphone....bought the waterproof case and a home made floater, cheap insurance IMO  when work gives me a ipad I'll get a waterproof case for that too and find a way to use it in the boat for sure"
770131,darsky,2013-02-25 20:59:00,586,"I was vacationing in South East Asia over Christmas and noticed many people had these water proof holders for their cell/smart phones and tablets. They are plastic based products with velcro, water/rain resistant and not expensive. After returning home and doing a bit of homework including a visit to an Apple store-I see that there is nothing here that is comparable. They would be great for outdoor use-in the rain,by the pool or in a boat. I am looking to maybe import and sell them here. Any opinions?"
770135,Acountdeleted,2013-02-25 21:06:00,2562,"In a heartbeat. In my line of work my phone gets slimy, sandy and overall beat up but I need to have it on me. Anything to keep it protected."
770136,Terry,2013-02-25 21:09:00,14456,if the price was right  you bet
770140,Jigger,2013-02-25 21:11:00,1237,Ziplock bag
770156,davew3,2013-02-25 21:42:00,430,"carefull Darsky,   there are lot's of different covers out there now.  LogiXML.com/Dashboard-WP The Kickstarter product has received an overwhelming response, so your pre-order may take awhile. But the high impact polycarbonate case looks worth it. Price: $69.99 "
770158,Rod Caster,2013-02-25 21:50:00,5784,"Water resistant isn't water proof... not sure I would trust water resistant with my $500 device.  I thought I saw something at wholesale sports or cabelas that was similar, but I could be mistaken."
770168,Roy,2013-02-25 22:23:00,13728,My opinion Darren is that I would have kept my mouth shut and would have done a little market research.
770171,Angler management,2013-02-25 22:38:00,280,"You can buy a life-proof case at almost any phone store and bestbuy. I think they cost $60 and are ""water-proof""! They are slimmer and better looking then otterbox. And about the same price. My best friend owns one for his iphone5 and has taken countless underwater pics with it already."
770208,Luke V.,2013-02-26 00:44:00,286,I have a life proof case for my 4s. It is water proof. Only good until it reaches 2m of depth. Only thing I don't like about it is that there is no way to attach a lanyard to hook to my wrist. I'm afraid of dropping it
770209,Christopheraaron,2013-02-26 00:47:00,3525,"Ya, lots out there. Here's the one I have, sound works fine, can use touch and its waterproof, one drawback is that it can be tricky to take the phone out and put it in, if there was one that went in a bit easier that would be great.  http://cascadedesigns.com/e-case"
770212,danbouck,2013-02-26 00:59:00,4380,I have a lifeproof for my iphone now. It's 100% waterproof
770215,moxie,2013-02-26 01:16:00,1566,"Apple? Nothing but a state of mind. Electronics have become more disposable than ever. The line between needs and wants has become so blurred most of us have been all but blinded. Buy cheap phone, phone breaks, buy new phone. Just more unnecessary junk. Wouldn't even waste a Ziplock bag, especially on an iPhone."
770224,Rich,2013-02-26 02:07:00,3927,Oh thats relevent information about your opinion. Thnx
770227,BassMan11,2013-02-26 02:21:00,583,Hahaha that's what I was thinking.
770246,kemper,2013-02-26 03:22:00,2232,"Careful, a friend of mine dunked his in the Saugeen in a lifeproof case, and it was toast!"
770258,Luke V.,2013-02-26 04:05:00,286,Must not have been in correctly. I have shot underwater video and taken pics with my life proof. There are very specific instructions on how to install the case. Must be inspected after being dropped etc And the manufacturer does say its good only to a certain depth. 2 metres
770261,registerfly,2013-02-26 04:45:00,198,plenty of different ones at mec as well.

770297,lew,2013-02-26 14:52:00,12766,About the only time I need to worry about my phone is in the boat and I just toss it into a dry bag if it's gonna get wet.
770335,Luke V.,2013-02-26 17:58:00,286,Thanks for the link Mike! I didn't know they had been released yet!!!
770341,Reelaction,2013-02-26 18:16:00,33,"Here is a link to the phone I use and never need to worry about it getting wet or droping it.  Check out the website. I have abused (I meant owned) this phone for 6 months and it is rugged. http://www.sonimtech.ca/products/xp5520bolt.php  It is made by Sonim and offered by Bell. Rogers also carries a different phone by Sonim.  I know it doesn't have all the fancy apps of I phone or crackberry, but if you play or work in rugged conditions.....nothing beats it.  By the way... I am in no way affiliated with Sonim, just love the product"
770377,porkpie,2013-02-26 20:41:00,2521,He just doesn't have one..... Lol!  My IPhone has pretty much replaced my laptop for me!
770413,moxie,2013-02-26 23:54:00,1566,"Can't do that Sin. It's not in my cynical nature. Hows this. If I was as plugged in to the gills and distracted as most of the world seems to be these days I might be inclined to buy a life preserver for my electronic device, that will last until......the next new and shiny one hits the shelves?  Better?"
770422,moxie,2013-02-27 00:15:00,1566,"There is a certain level of convenience to having certain devices but really now, who thinks it makes any sense to watch the world go by on a 4"" screen? Have a family member that is quite the tech guru and he too was one of the duped until he realized long ago Apple was more cult than substance.   They also announced they are giving back the better part of 100 Million dollars to people that may have paid too much for i-tunes downloads. Me have a sneaking suspicion a few i-zombies have awakened from their i-slumber and and are on to the i-ruse perpetuated by this hollow giant and the realization apple products have been caught up to and it should only be a matter of time until they are surpassed. Everyone knows an apple with a bite out of it will eventually rot away, don't they? Heck even i-know that."
