Avery is heading up to Kesagami to work for the season and we have a 5 night trip booked up there as well, with one day on the outpost lake as well.  I can't wait!  Got myself a 12 foot tinny on a trailer with a 2.5 hp brand new Yamaha so Monique and I can start exploring all the great little gems we've found while 4-wheeling around Jiggy.  We're planning on a ton of videos to support the new store.  Cant believe my boy is off to work in the bush ...  he'll be right at home!!    Man...  im sick of plowing the driveway."
