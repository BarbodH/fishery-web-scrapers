770671,dylan21,2013-02-28 00:21:00,22,Does anybody know if there is or if somebody makes any transducer arms that bolt into the humminbird portable base? For ice fishing purposes.
770730,Nipfisher,2013-02-28 02:04:00,2449,I threw mine away for my Lowrance HDS5. Some pipe insulation (or pool noodle) and 2 zip ties are better then any arm in my opinion.
770731,BillM,2013-02-28 02:05:00,17367,You want to bolt the transducer directly to the portable base?
770741,Christopheraaron,2013-02-28 02:11:00,3525,"I think he wants the arm that holds the transducer over the hole...  The pool noodle sounds like a good idea, but you need 2 holes"
770744,BillM,2013-02-28 02:12:00,17367,I'd just buy an ice ducer with the foam and be done with it.
770745,irishfield,2013-02-28 02:13:00,26272,"Why do you need two holes?.. although we (I) usually drill them anyhow. Last thing I'd want is my finder that close to the hole using that stupid arm.  As Nipfisher said, some water pipe wrap foam. About 6 to 9"" long. Just loop your transducer cable through and around it one wrap. Then you can adjust it as you need based on ice thickness to get the 'ducer below the ice."

770929,dylan21,2013-02-28 22:33:00,22,I was just wondering If there were any other options. I got the ice ducer free with my finder. Thanks for the replies
771021,camillj,2013-03-01 03:52:00,1988,"Bass Pro sells one designed to be a transom mount clamp that you can attach/bolt your xducer to ... I clamp a piece of 1""X2""X3' to form a tee at the top of the hole ... and my graph just sits on the cooler (to keep it up off the ice) and the xducer goes down the same hole as my minnow ...that way I can easily mark my minnow (a separate hole makes it very hard to mark your minnow at 40 - 80 feet)... in my case I can watch my minnow swimming around and getting all 'worried' when a fish is approaching - even before I mark the incoming fish"
771139,SirCranksalot,2013-03-01 22:27:00,3291,"When using 1 hole, what do you do when you hook a fish? Do you just yank the arm/bracket or whatever out of the way with 1 hand while you hold the rod with the other? I'd hate to lose a fishing while trying to get the xducer out of the way."
771157,DRIFTER_016,2013-03-01 23:22:00,10439,"Yes, that is generally the way. I just drill an extra hole for my transducer. It's a pain when the ice is 5 feet thick though!!!  Here's my setup. Right hole for finder and left fer fishin'. If I have a buddy with me it's 3 holes with the ducer in the middle hole.  "
771167,bdox,2013-03-02 00:05:00,329,"There's a guy in Iowa or Minnesota that machines them out of aluminium. You can find him on Ice Shanty, but I forget his username."
771296,ah_long,2013-03-02 15:04:00,354,"I thought about buying the metal arm but didn't for one reason, metal + cold weather + water = not too good  marcum has the arm for $10, remember to get the stopper as well  http://marcumtech.com/sonar-parts/transducer-support-arm-hardware.html http://marcumtech.com/sonar-parts/transducer-stop.html"
