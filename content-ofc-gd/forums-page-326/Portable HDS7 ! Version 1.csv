767579,Lunker777,2013-02-13 17:53:00,866,"A couple weeks ago, I had posted the question about making my HDS7 portable. Thanks again to everyone who replied and helped me out.  I took some time last Friday night to put everything together and see if I could make it work.  So I bought a Aluminum Carry case from Canadian tire for $30... A 12V battery & Charger for $50... and I was ready to go.    .          I used the spare transducer I had lying around and rigged it up on some extra 1"" aluminum angle I had... lying around  lol              It fits nicely in the rod case for transport.      So.... I have had it out on the ice and tested it for all of 15 minutes. We moved at that point to some really skinny water ( 3 ft) so I had no use for the Sonar anymore.... which sucked lol  What I did find out from the little time I got to use it.... ITS AWESOME !!!!! lol Its like playing a video game. I never realized what I was missing by not having a sonar/flasher till now.  Like the title says.... its Version 1. It was thrown together with little thought, I just wanted something ready for the next day. I would like to clean up/re-route the power cable and lead wires. Also, I would like to get an ice transducer for the unit. I could potentially pack everything into the little case that way. If not, the ice transducer is a little more user friendly, I don't have to worry about it being level, etc..... stay tuned for V.2 !  Thanks for looking  PS... A bonus about having it set up as a portable... I can bring it inside, or in the tackle room and play with my way points, study maps, etc. Its great !!!"

767588,Terry,2013-02-13 19:10:00,14456,Nicely done I love my video game.I mean my hds5 portable
767604,Lunker777,2013-02-13 21:21:00,866,"I agree.... but for the price, I couldn't find another box that was nearly as sturdy/heavy duty for the same price. The ""cheaper"" tool boxes etc. were either to small, a awkward size, or flimsy as heck !  I was surprised to find such a nice carry case for $30 though.... I'm thinking about getting another one to store my HDS screens in during the summer months to transport them to/from the water."
769895,johnnyb,2013-02-24 17:44:00,3413,"I like that case....I've been using a soft-sided thermal bag for years.....starting to break down a bit now.  If you're in deep stuff, you'll definitely appreciate the ice ducer....either way you have a super slick setup"
769901,Chance,2013-02-24 18:04:00,420,Awesome set up ! I run HDS units on my boat and love the resolution and features they offer.
770274,Lunker777,2013-02-26 13:11:00,866,I used it yesterday and it accounted for at least 10 fish. I would have not got those bites if I didn't have the HDS there.  It really opened my eyes .... how many fish have I missed THIS YEAR alone without the electronics ?
770276,Roy,2013-02-26 13:21:00,13728,That's a professional looking job...nicely done! Can you tell yet how long that battery will keep the 7 going on a full charge?
770384,Lunker777,2013-02-26 20:55:00,866," Well yesterday I ran it pretty well all day ( 9am-5:30pm)  and she dropped to about 11.6 V.  That was FULLY charged the night before.  I was really impressed with the amount of time I got out of the battery. I think it shuts off at 11 volts ? I can't remember. If it were a ""from dusk till dawn "" type of fishing day. I think it would have died."
770391,Roy,2013-02-26 21:55:00,13728, Thanks. That sounds good cause they're powerful units. For very long day of fishing it wouldn't be a big deal to bring an extra 7.5ah.
770395,Garnet,2013-02-26 22:16:00,2056,Check the soft lunch bags with plastic liner. I found one to fit my Accu view.
770525,Lunker777,2013-02-27 14:57:00,866," I think I will ad one for next year (Version 2.0) so if I forget to charge over night, or if we go on a trip up north and I forget to charge.. there is no worries.  For an extra $20-30 it will be worth it."
770529,lew,2013-02-27 15:17:00,12766,"Nice job, very impressive  work !!"
770587,Andrew Grant,2013-02-27 18:37:00,201,.
770813,Lunker777,2013-02-28 13:25:00,866,Thanks for all the comments guys  Unfortunately .... the ice seems to be finished for this year around here.... time to set it back up for soft water and get ready for the DEEEEEEEEEEtroit river !!!  Tight lines everyone
