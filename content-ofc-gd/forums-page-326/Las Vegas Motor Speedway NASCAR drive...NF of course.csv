Talked to him last night and he said it was simply awesome. He has new respect for the drivers....he had thought, like me, that you just keep it wide open and turn left...lol! He said that 150mph came up in a heartbeat (they were limited to 150). He said that the only way to describe the car was ""an axe murderer on steroids""! No pics but he does have a video that I will try to post when he gets home.."
