769654,Joey,2013-02-23 03:06:00,9122,2011 was a good year on Simcoe for ice fishing for most from my recollection.  Was for me anyhow
769656,BillM,2013-02-23 03:07:00,17367,"Been a great year for lakers, whitefish not so much."
769673,Jigger,2013-02-23 13:07:00,1237,"Dont know about Simcoe. But in Haliburton, ive noticed that there are strong bites at fairly specific times. My own sample size is very small compared to others though. Weather hasnt really been a strong indicator of whether or not im going out. Just so happens that every chance i get, its at least -20deg..."
769718,DoubleDigits,2013-02-23 16:39:00,140,Can anyone actually confirm all this talk about a big whitefish die-off?? Seems like a lot of talk based on only one second hand account of what someone saw on a camera that I have found on the web...
769722,BillM,2013-02-23 17:23:00,17367, No one can confirm anything..
769750,Burtess,2013-02-23 22:06:00,901,"Wednesday, Feb. 20, 2013 - out from Oro Line 2 - 110 ft water - lots of fish marked, lots of follows but no committals.  Friday, Feb. 22, 2012 - out from Oro Line 2 - 115 ft water - many fish marked, some follows, no takers.  Burt"
769839,Sharkbait22,2013-02-24 13:38:00,297,"Yup. I could also look at the solunar times.  Getting a free solunar calendar that can handle past present and future daily rankings and major times is the challenge.   A free app (my fishing advisor)  for my phone allows you to get data for any period but the major times seem off by 1hr when compared to the solunar website (solunarforecast.com).  Don't know who is right.  For Feb 24th today the major time from the app is 10:34-12:34, but the solunar website says 11:31 AM - 1:31 PM. Both pretty similar.  Anyway thanks for the advice. It's something I'll try keep my eye on."
769841,Roy,2013-02-24 13:56:00,13728,"Mine says 11:06am to 1:06pm.in Boucherville, Quebec. Have you got the correct postal code punched in to both apps?"
769849,Sharkbait22,2013-02-24 14:52:00,297,"What website are you using Roy.  The solunarforecast website asks for a postal code.  I used Tromblys Fishing store in Orillia just north of Simcoe.  The app has a map of North America for which I also used Tromblys fishing store. The app is one hour earlier (10:34 vs. 11:31) for the start of the 2 hr major time.  The solunar website is likely the correct time, particularly if you notice that Boucherville should be a little earlier than Simcoe for today. Sun comes up earlier in the east.  So that makes sense.  Either way it looks like the good fishing is soon to begin for today. I wish I could verify but I'm stuck at home.  Maybe tomorrow."
769852,Roy,2013-02-24 15:06:00,13728,Check this one out and see if the times match. Enter the postal code (or nearest where you will be fishing) http://http://www.solunarforecast.com/solunarcalendar.aspx
769932,Sharkbait22,2013-02-24 20:41:00,297,That's the website I've been using.
769936,Roy,2013-02-24 20:57:00,13728,Well that one is good then.
770468,Sharkbait22,2013-02-27 02:57:00,297,"Monday was supposed to be hot and heavy around 12-2pm and one of the better days for the month. Well I'm not so sure about the tables.  Went out this Monday on Simcoe and got skunked.  Moved many times, covered a lot of water. Armed with good information and had a hard time even finding fish. Yikes. Looking at some of the message boards it sounds like every one did poorly.  An MNR friend noted fish few being caught. Time to think outside the box.  Down-size, live bait, set lines? I don't know.  Go old school.  Looking for some great days in the next couple of weeks."
770476,Angler management,2013-02-27 03:30:00,280,Does anybody know a postal code for beaverton area?
770477,Sharkbait22,2013-02-27 03:38:00,297,L0K 1A0  I Googled Beaverton.  Afternoon bite looks best.  Major Times 12:40 AM - 2:40 AM1:04 PM - 3:04 PMMinor Times6:56 AM - 7:56 AM7:20 PM - 8:20 PMSolunar RatingBest
770480,Angler management,2013-02-27 03:46:00,280,I dont get the star rating??
770674,Sharkbait22,2013-02-28 00:25:00,297,I think the entire day is rated relative to other days in the month.  In addition they provide specific times during the day.
