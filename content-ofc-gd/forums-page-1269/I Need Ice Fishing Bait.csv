34610,pooch,2007-02-14 20:54:00,139,"I can't seem to find even dew worms. I'd prefer maggots or something small. Power baits are working, but only just. Anyone know of a live-bait dealer in the Peterborough area that has supplies?"
34627,fishdawg,2007-02-14 21:57:00,912,"hmmm thats tough - with all lakes closed now I'd be suprised if any area shops were open....   guys like Smokey & Jer live in the area, & could probably have an accurate answer for ya?"

34643,Beans,2007-02-14 22:26:00,3339,I'm in the same pickle up here in Bobcaygeon...All bait shops are closed for the season...  Last week I stopped into the local pet shop and they said if I give them a week's lead time they can order waxworms for me...great for tipping a small Swedish Pimple or tear jig or small jiggin rapala...  A bit pricey at $0.15 each and I'm assumming they will want a minimum order of 50 or 100...gotta check that out...  Please post results of your Peterboro finds or PM...Thanks
34648,FishHeadRic,2007-02-14 22:51:00,226,"He guys,  If all you're looking for is grubs or wax worm just go to your local pet store like Beans said. The have feeder grubs, usually wax worms, and even crickets. Cheap too. I think the last time I went out I only payed 1.25$ for a dozen of them.  FHR"
34649,glirw,2007-02-14 22:57:00,200,"You can breed your own wax worms/maggots by putting a bag of household garbage in a garbage bag , close it , put it in room temperature , and wait a week . When you open it you will find a huge population of maggots which work well for fishing .  I never tried to do this purposely , but one time last summer I found out the hard way that this indeed works."
34675,mittzu,2007-02-14 23:34:00,48,there is worms in Campbellford at a place called Dukes....if you need directions let me know.. the place is right down the street and I know they got worms and minnows .... If campbellford is to far I am sorry I cant help
34699,Smokey,2007-02-15 00:28:00,1278,They listed all the shops in the area but to be honest I'm not sure who's selling bait this time of the year. Peterborough live bait might be the best bet as he wholesales to the area and he sells smaller baits also. I would give him a call and if he can't help you out he might be able to point you in the right direction.  Good Luck
34708,Jigatollah,2007-02-15 00:47:00,53,  Fishing Plus has closed down. It's now a used car shop.
34726,lew,2007-02-15 01:15:00,12767," Hmmmmmm, that's too bad, he had a nice little tackle shop there and I bought quite a bit of stuff off him over the last few years.  His musky baits were priced to match anybody."
34776,Jer,2007-02-15 02:26:00,1426,Bridgenorth Sports is open and has minnows (I'm not sure about other bait). Apparently he gets lotsa guys buying bait for fishing Jack's Lake.
35365,pooch,2007-02-16 15:03:00,139,"Thanks guys, no answer (just machines) at the above listed numbers. May try a pet store around the corner from me.  Lew, I was surprised like you when that little store closed down. 2 Canadian Tires, and a Walmart were too tough to compete with is my guess."
35401,Josh Rogers,2007-02-16 17:07:00,79,Don't rely on the bait shop in Bridgenorth. I have been there multiple times this year and have yet to be able to buy minnows from them. They were out for over a week earlier in the season. I haven't been back since then.
35509,Jer,2007-02-16 22:37:00,1426,I was just at Bridgenorth Sports on Tuesday to buy some lures to fish Simcoe on Saturday.  Frank had lots of minnows and said he has been selling all winter. Maybe give a call beforehand to make sure: 705-292-9751
