34530,darsky,2007-02-14 16:48:00,586,.....announced this week that they are going on tour again with confirmed dates in Toronto and MONTREAL. I've never seen them live as they split when I was 14. Is anyone else as exited as me about this ???
34539,Headhunter,2007-02-14 17:22:00,5703,"I have nothing but respect for Andy Summers and Stuart Copeland. I think they are incredible musicians, ground breakers in many cases, but I can't stand Sting! His solo work was in a word BORING! He's so over rated, it disgusts me. I'd consider attending the concert, but only if a large truck or train, would do the world a favour and squish Sting into the ground! I wonder if anyone would really notice or miss him? What's the difference between Sting and Jesus... Jesus doesn't think he's Sting! Enjoy the show! HH"
34540,huey graphite,2007-02-14 17:28:00,362, That's hilarious.......now stop sitting on the fence and tell us what you really think!
34542,Headhunter,2007-02-14 17:32:00,5703,"I know HG, I'm slowly workin my way out of my shell! HH"
34544,irishfield,2007-02-14 17:36:00,26272,You use to be such a quiet guy Joe !
34552,ccmtcanada,2007-02-14 17:52:00,7971,I was pretty excited until I heard the ticket prices were $238 each...LOL.  Still great to see them making music again though.
34564,Whopper,2007-02-14 18:48:00,2174,  $238 bucks I don't think so. I'd have a hard time paying that to see Shania nakid  Whopper
34566,Headhunter,2007-02-14 18:52:00,5703,"Ticket prices start in the mid $50.00 range and go up to $238.00 for the best seats in the house. You could really have fun throwing stuff at Sting, from the good seats! HH"
34567,douG,2007-02-14 18:54:00,2693,"Shania nekkid wasn't bad, it was her chasing me around the furniture that I couldn't handle."
34577,Whopper,2007-02-14 19:10:00,2174, Now that might be worth the price of admission  somehow this doesn't look or sound right     sorry darsky didn't mean to step all over your thread
34599,Kirk,2007-02-14 20:24:00,347,"I hope to be going (going solo my date/wife will be 8 months pregnant at that time), I have one of their 'albums' in my collection.  200 ticket 20 parking leaving at the opening song for wife going into labour,  priceless    douG, if she does that again, call the cops, that can be so annoying"
34601,irishfield,2007-02-14 20:30:00,26272,Someone mentions Police and a Lawyer shows up! Who wudda figured ! LOL
34602,Headhunter,2007-02-14 20:31:00,5703,"Well Kirk, then you'll have an open seat right next to you, so you can pile up all the stuff your gonna throw at Sting!!! HH"
34607,Kirk,2007-02-14 20:47:00,347,"The only thing I'll throw is compliments, if you don't see me posting on OFC its because I'll be busy rehearsing my rendition of Roxanne.  The Police and a lawyer...if I get a few pals from the office, it'll be the Police and the Talking Heads"
34609,Headhunter,2007-02-14 20:53:00,5703,"LOL Kirk!   Can't talk you into bringing along a ""message in a bottle""?  Perhaps get all the Talking Heads to line up in ""syncronicity""? Ok, I'll stop! Enjoy the show! HH"
34613,Kirk,2007-02-14 21:06:00,347,"Admit it HH, you and probably most anyone that says they hate the Police, you sing Roxanne in the shower or in the car if no one is within earshot  I will enjoy, thanks HH"
34625,dheitzner,2007-02-14 21:45:00,314,can't wait to see them!
34676,Tybo,2007-02-14 23:36:00,1373,"Bet you, I could hit sting with a full water bottle at 150'"
34704,mikemo,2007-02-15 00:37:00,27,Well said HH - I agree with you on that. I saw them at a Police Picnic in the 80's and I stopped listening to them after that.  I left thinking they were pretty arrogant - probably just Sting I guess.  They were probably a little mad as the Talking Heads blew them away with their set.
34739,OhioFisherman,2007-02-15 01:29:00,6623,I saw dune(sci-fi classic) is Sting gay?
34767,darsky,2007-02-15 02:01:00,586,I don't mind paying that coin if this is what I get http://youtube.com/watch?v=Li9NIj-wn4A
34768,Mike the Pike,2007-02-15 02:02:00,3421,Ya I liked the Police In my hay days but I didn't like Sting when he went solo .After we heard some of of the solo stuff from Stink my friends and I were dissapointed.  For $238.00 I could buy some more useful fishing gear.I miss the good old days when it cost me $26 to see April Wine and AC DC.
