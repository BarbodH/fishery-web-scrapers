34568,tinbanger,2007-02-14 18:54:00,1028,"Pikeie and I made it there just before 7pm and got some of the last few seats , it end up a full house with 53 people in attendance. Wils presentation was interesting and well balanced , something for the novice as well as the more experienced.  Lots of interesting facts about the lake  55 species of fish 1962 Rainbow smelt first discovered 1987 Black crappie first discovered 2000 blue gill 2005 rusty crayfish 2006 goby in 2004 Quagga mussels were found , they like everything Zebra mussels don't deep water , soft bottoms  Discussions on how these invading sepcies effect the fish .IE Whitefish at 60FOW now commonly hit lures suspended at the 30 foot mark , pike are getting tougher thru the ice both could be a result of water clarity improving .  Interesting discussion on perch and how everyone is experiencing more 'dinks' less jumbos .Appears to be no clear answer but with the appearance of the Spiney water flea the perch or becoming used to ' sucking' them off plant life resulting in a much softer 'bite'  Wils suggestions boiled down to finesse presentations ( lighter line , smaller baits, less and more subtle jigging) and watching your line.  Good night , ended up with a few lures as a door prize and met up with a fellow OFNR 'FYRFTRY' )sorry as I may have butchered your handle.)  Hopefully more local events like this to come.  Tinbanger"
