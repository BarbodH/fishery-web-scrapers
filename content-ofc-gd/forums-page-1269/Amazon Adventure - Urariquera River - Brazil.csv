34621,setomonkey,2007-02-14 21:24:00,872,"That's quite the first post!  Great pictures, are there peacock bass in that river?  Fishing in the Amazon would be an amazing adventure...  Mike"
34623,fishergirl72,2007-02-14 21:44:00,455,"Wow, those are some really beautiful fish that was caught. Way to go!!!"

34646,tjsa,2007-02-14 22:46:00,1578,"Hey man, where you been????? Cool first report on the new board."
34663,vanillagorilla,2007-02-14 23:21:00,46,It took 2 days of travel to get there and 2 days of travel to get out.  3 planes 2 buses and a helicopter  There are only small Peacock Bass in this river.  The natives use them for bait to catch the Giant Catfish.  Mitch
34668,mittzu,2007-02-14 23:25:00,48,i really never thought that a pirronha can get that BIG anyway WOW looks like a pretty spot to take the wife......Was the bugs just as big?  great pictures thank you.

34690,Rich Clemens,2007-02-15 00:09:00,3131,"Oh wow ... you lucky dog !!!!  That would be a dream trip for all of us on here.   I for one really appreciate sharing those pics with us.    If ya got any more ... put them up, I'd love to see them."
34736,moparrothead,2007-02-15 01:26:00,4,What did you do with the fish keep eat or throw back ??
34741,vanillagorilla,2007-02-15 01:31:00,46,At this time of year from December to March is the dry season in the Amazon Basin.  As a result there is very little rain and no bugs.  The only pests that we had to be careful of were the read Fire Ants.  There were a couple of people who ran into some and the results were not pretty.  It looked like they had chicken pocks and very itchy.  I was very supprised how safe and bug free the Amazon was in our experience.
34743,vanillagorilla,2007-02-15 01:33:00,46,We ate some of the smaller fish especially the Pirahna.  They taste like Walleye.
34745,GbayGiant,2007-02-15 01:35:00,1780,Amazing. Did you go for a swim with the piranhas ? I think it would be safer swimming with sharks.
34747,Mike the Pike,2007-02-15 01:38:00,3421,"Awesome report very different and colourful fish .Sunfish on steroids.I never knew pirahna grew that size.  No swimming for me over there ,imagine meeting up with 100 pirahna's like that.Yup you would turn into an instant skeleton.  "
34757,vanillagorilla,2007-02-15 01:46:00,46,Believe it or not those Pirahna are only interested in other fish.  My buddy went for a swim with no problems.
34761,joonmoon,2007-02-15 01:53:00,528,"Hey thanks for the great report. That looks like an awesome trip. And the fishin must have been a blast. Even the shots of the jungle being so thick,lush and green looked so cool. We need more photos."
34769,mepps,2007-02-15 02:03:00,1301,"amazing, looks like a great trip!"
34829,carll2,2007-02-15 04:16:00,443,"awesome report a couple weeks back i saw a show on discovery about piranahs and man these things are nuts, they put a dad  cow in the water and it was gone withing 2 minutes"
