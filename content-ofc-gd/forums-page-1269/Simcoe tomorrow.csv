They seem to be moving a lot lately...just when I find them...few days later they are gone... Will try few spots I did well last year. Hope to get lucky ;-) I know it is last minute thing but if anyone wants to come alone and share the gas PM me with your number and I'll call you to chat where to meet. Preferably from the west as I live west of GTA.  Cheers, Ice Fisherman"
