33961,Marc Thorpe,2007-02-13 13:37:00,621,"Or his Undies are too tight ,might explain his shreiking  "
33969,ccmtcanada,2007-02-13 13:53:00,7971,Wow...unbelieveable footage!  Probably pull me right in the water!! Thanks Rick.

34144,ecmilley,2007-02-13 19:30:00,2163,"i would be thrilled to get down there for some fishing, Pete you need any guest for a show"
34265,muskiebobsr,2007-02-13 23:38:00,49,Great day had by all right.  I have to get south again some day.   Great show.  Thanks   Bob
34370,Crazyhook,2007-02-14 04:09:00,1154,here is a monster caught from shore  
34396,muskiebobsr,2007-02-14 05:26:00,49,How big was that one Crazyhook??  I caught a 300 pounder in 1978 in the Gulf of Mexico.  What a battle from 300 feet down.   Bob 
34399,snag,2007-02-14 05:46:00,1932,Those were incredible!!   You just can't go wrong around docks; It's a universal traesure trove!  Wonder how they taste?
34438,Crazyhook,2007-02-14 13:19:00,1154,"Robert, i did not catch that one but it was estimated to be around 500 pounds  Snag Goliath grouper are a protected species and have to be released"
34533,muskiebobsr,2007-02-14 16:58:00,49,Back in 78 they were sold at the docks to resturants for 25 cents a pound hanging weight.  I'd never kill anothe rfish like that on purpose but coming up from that deep they die.  I don't like killing anything anymore.  Catch and release is my thing now.  Good Fishing Bob
34786,Minnow,2007-02-15 02:47:00,177,Those are some nice Goliath Groupers!  Here is another chew on this episode and this fish is supposed to be 500 lbs this is INTENSE!  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_it62G0QnA
