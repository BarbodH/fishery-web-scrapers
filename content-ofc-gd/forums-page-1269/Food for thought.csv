34701,pidge,2007-02-15 00:33:00,438,Hey all was just thinkin of ideas of what to bring out on the ice to eat. What do you guys like to cook with and eat. I was out icefishing for the first time last weekend and rented a heated hut. I ended up bringing my coleman camp stove to heat up some chef-boy r d (sp?) buttered bread and some cookies. What do you guys bring thats small and conveinent to carry or drag behind a toboggon? I think next I'll bring along some canned chilli.
34702,FishFinder,2007-02-15 00:35:00,481,hot tea or coffe in a thermos
34734,Frankypro,2007-02-15 01:22:00,63,"Hi Pidge,  I'm with FishFinder on the Thermos idea.  I usually bring my Stainless steel with some hot Tomato soup, a sandwich and some snacks - granolas, apples a sleave of cookies, to keep busy when the bite is slow.  I've brought a frying pan to Simcoe before and had a fish fry right in the hut...BUT we didn't togaggan everything in either.    I have a pot of Goose Chili on the stove right now to stuff into the thermos  for this weekend."
34738,Beans,2007-02-15 01:29:00,3339,Spam g'weeches and a hot soup in my stainless steel thermos...Right Cliff?  Ya...cookies is good
34740,dheitzner,2007-02-15 01:31:00,314,"for our annual trip to hyatts, i usually make a big pot of chili ahead of time and heat it up in the hut.  it can be frozen and is easy to reheat when supper rolls around. spaghetti & sauce is another good bet if you have the facilities."
34756,pidge,2007-02-15 01:44:00,438,"When you're hungry, everything tastes good Yeah your right about that Campet"
34759,Mike the Pike,2007-02-15 01:51:00,3421,Hot Habitant soup and grilled cheese sandwhiches.     MTP
34772,douG,2007-02-15 02:11:00,2693,"As a chile, Habitant pea soup, coupla holes punched in the lid,  then stuffed in the shore fire until it boiled, bread and salami and cheese, good to go.  When the can o soup boiled, he'd hack a hole the lid to pour.  My Pa sorta looked after me.  As a pure  and refined grown-up, I take a thermos of coffee,  some gweeches, water, and chocolate bars.  If Brian is frying up some moose sausages, then that is ok too.  Spaghetti is a tough one,  since you need to boil so much water for 4 hungry fisher types.  I like the idea of baked beans and bread, esp with a nice crisp bottle of water.  misfish has a real snazzy float suit btw."
34783,urbanangler1990,2007-02-15 02:45:00,933,"we brought hot chocolate in thermoses, brought one of those stoves and cooked oriental noodles, mmmm"

34825,carll2,2007-02-15 04:05:00,443,"me and my buds usually bring out smoked deep sausage  or deep steaks  make a fire and fry it up, along with some potatoes cooked before hand and we just fry them up and pea soup"
34840,Rich,2007-02-15 05:59:00,3927,Everything from chicken weiners to striploin steaks to peameal bacon.. the hibachi always gets a workout
34863,aplumma,2007-02-15 12:13:00,6896,Aww man you all forgot the best fishin eats around.....vienna sausages and sardines in hot sauce on ritz crackers. Dont forget your favorite hot beverage to drink though after all it is really stinkin cold between bites out their.  Art
34866,Big Cliff,2007-02-15 12:21:00,6899,"Yah! Beans LOL.  Thermous of hot tea, spamwhiches, some times I take along some venison pepperetts, or prosuto and fresh buns. Having a high calory lunch when you are out in the cold all day is really good for you!"
34981,samson,2007-02-15 18:44:00,8,"re-heated kfc  lately i've been trying to cut down on the weight in my portable so now it's protein bars, cripy minis and gatorade"
35252,duber,2007-02-16 07:58:00,220,"If I'm in my big hut the sky is the limit.I have a wood stove in it so cooking is not a problem.Last weekend it was a big pot o chille,the weekend before it was venison sausages.Nothing beats a mid-morning pike that happened to be in the wrong place at the worng time!If I'm in the portable I like to keep it simple a sandwich or two or soup or a pepperete etc."
