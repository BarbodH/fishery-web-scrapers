34211,OhioFisherman,2007-02-13 21:22:00,6623,"There is probably close to 8 inches on the ground here already, schools have already called and they will be closed again tomorrow. All kinds of accidents on the highways, some counties have closed their roads except for emergency vehicles.  Best bet in weather like this is to log onto OFC and chill out! No travel!"
34213,huntervasili,2007-02-13 21:27:00,1604,We are getting some in burlington now... making its way over to oakville/missisauga/Toronto... Any in those areas yet?
34219,dsn,2007-02-13 21:36:00,1018,Nothing here yet in Downtown Toronto. But the temps have drop considerably I can feel my finger tips turn ice cold. Just happened a few seconds ago.  But I'm glad things will be all done with Friday cause I'm heading out with fish4me for some lakers and white fish hopefully.  dsn
34234,Rich Clemens,2007-02-13 22:08:00,3131,Started here in south-central PA this morning and we have several inches on the ground now.  Just changed over to sleet and freezing rain about an hour ago.  Much more to come for us - just not sure how much snow or how much of the frozen stuff.  Tomorrow morning should be interesting.  I hear the further north of us you go - the more snow they are go get.  At least that is what they are reporting for Northern PA and into New York.
34236,snoil,2007-02-13 22:12:00,139,Just starting here in Etobicoke at the 427.Was like this in Oakville at 10 this morning.
34239,FishFinder,2007-02-13 22:22:00,481,if its a snow day expect a fishing report from me Gonna have to walk to the river though

34388,~CK~,2007-02-14 04:47:00,30,"I just got home (I live on the North York/Etobicoke border) and it is certainly coming down out there! Been heavy since about 6-6:30 this evening.. I was out running errands and shtuff and got stuck in it pretty bad. A couple centimetres on the ground already and cars are having trouble stopping. I almost got hit a couple times crossing the street.  Drivers, give yourself lots of braking room before a stoplight. It's slippery out there. Don't speed, take your time. Hope most of you are inside and toasty warm right now anyway. Don't go out unless you have to."
34391,huntervasili,2007-02-14 04:59:00,1604,Still Coming down really hard here in burlington... Gonna be white outhere in the morning
34406,Fisherman,2007-02-14 09:15:00,7201,Looks like the streets and highways are pretty much covered this morning...http://www.mto.gov.on.ca/english/traveller/compass/camera/burlington/camhome.htm
34412,misfish,2007-02-14 11:31:00,29133,"HEY..............YOU GUYS WERE TO KEEP THIS STUFF BELOW HWY 7,NOW YOU CAN GET UP HERE AND SHOVEL MY DRIVE WAY."
34417,lew,2007-02-14 11:58:00,12767,"Kinda nice with that strong wind that was blowing all night, it kept my place nearly snow free. There was no snow at all on my truck and the driveway was almost as clean. I went out an hour ago and it took me 5 minutes to get things cleaned up.  Think I'll sit back now with another coffee, and watch all the traffic jams on the morning news"
34420,ccmtcanada,2007-02-14 12:21:00,7971,"Brought some work home yesterday, so I'll be working from here!  Roads are of course a mess and GO transit reporting delays and one Lakeshore train already cancelled this morning. Not worth the hassle!  Now, if I could find a nice wind sheltered place to fish....lol."
34434,OhioFisherman,2007-02-14 13:10:00,6623,"It ain`t pretty out here! LOL Lucky momma doesn`t go to work till noon  today, she might not get out of the garage now. Still snowing and blowing, guessing between 12 and 16 inches on the ground. It is supposed to start clearing later in the day."
34436,Mike the Pike,2007-02-14 13:15:00,3421,The storm is just starting here not enough snow to keep me home but we know it will get worse.  On the road again.MTP
34446,xrap,2007-02-14 13:37:00,683,HOLY CRAP!!! I jsut woke up and the shed is half way burried my dad's car is all covered the snow is half way up to the doors!! We must of gotten over 60cm. There calling for 15-20 more for Hamilton cause of lake effect. We could see 70-80 when its all done. Biggest storm I ever seen  I wish I had a camera right about now.
34457,ehg,2007-02-14 14:33:00,2666,"I think all the snow blew in my driveway Lew. We got lucky here in Toronto, not much snow really, no school closings etc...     cheers,  ehg"
34464,Uncle Buck,2007-02-14 14:40:00,1000,"My house was a disaster...  had to turn the snow blower on... ( got it back in 2000, and this was the 10th time using it...)  the snow level was over the porch, about 5 feet in total...  you have no idea how many donuts i did in the court today..."
34471,lew,2007-02-14 14:46:00,12767," sorry bout that Eric, I wondered where it all ended up"
34487,OhioFisherman,2007-02-14 15:03:00,6623,"Still waiting for the farmer to show up and plow my drive, he uses a large articulated farm tractor with like a 12 foot blade. Couple of passes and he is done! Traffic is a mess here, parts of interstates closed due to accidents, reporting a record snowfall for Cleveland 15.7? inches in 24 hours.  On the bright side it`s on it`s way out weather radar snows it clearing in Huron and Sandusky, 50-60 miles west of Cleveland. Next Tuesday a high of 33 F! LOL summer!"
34572,carll2,2007-02-14 19:03:00,443,2cms here in montreal..the storm was downgraded   were only supposed to get 15-20cms
34717,Mike the Pike,2007-02-15 01:02:00,3421,We are getting it heavy hear in St.Hubert Carl and you only live 45 minutes form here we have had 15cm so far.I guess you will have to bring your sled out our way.
34821,carll2,2007-02-15 03:54:00,443,mike the storms winding down  and we have a total of 20cms.. bot bad although we were expecting 40cms for the montreal region. oh well next storm we will get it good.. its so weird cuz at one point we were supposed to get 50cms.. it gives us total of 60cms on the ground to date
33801,Garyv,2007-02-13 00:45:00,547,I can't loose either way.  If it misses us I work inside if it dosen't I'll be working outside.  I've already  filled the one plow with diesel and the other with gas so I don't have to do it in the colder snowy weather should it arrive.    I enjoy plowing snow...you make money having fun.
33803,Carp,2007-02-13 00:49:00,1488,"Well, in Toronto and surrounding area, they're predicting 10cm, so we should expect 1 to 100 cm's of snow. DANG weather forcasters !"
33806,ccmtcanada,2007-02-13 00:55:00,7971,LOL Carp...environment canada is now saying for Toronto....12 to 19cm tomorrow alone...not including anything we get on Wednesday.  Weathernetwork is saying 10-15cm not including Wednesday.  Wonder if it will be like the last one....I woke up in the morning and we had NOTHING!!! LOL
33845,carll2,2007-02-13 01:35:00,443,well they dont know for montreal yet but  one person says 15cm.. then accuweather says 30-45cm.. and meteo media says 25 cms... who knows but i know one thing il be out sledding
33854,Mike the Pike,2007-02-13 01:54:00,3421,  Glen that would be 12 inches Glen in the good old imperial system.  This is a good time to pick up a snowblower folks Wallymart has had some on sale $900.00 for a 10.5hp.  Snow no problem!!!!!!!!Winter tires make a big difference.  No help from the army required here in Montreal!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
33856,Joey,2007-02-13 01:56:00,9122,"Oh great, no more mail for me again tomorrow  Joey"
33861,Raf,2007-02-13 02:03:00,3495,"well i suppose it's about time southern ont. got hit.  woke up to a fresh 19"" two weekends ago up north.  not looking forward to the gridlock around the city though."
33862,Joey,2007-02-13 02:03:00,9122,"It's that darned Jet Stream, looks like it takes a left turn in Albuquerque!!!  "
33863,fishindevil,2007-02-13 02:07:00,6254,"well if we even get 10cm of snow we all know what traffic will be around the GTA,  so we all might as well call in sick and go ice fishing...  ..they said on global news that its going to last over tuesday & wednesday,with lots of windy blowing snow,so things will be a mess..  .everyone take care driving  and make it home safe..."
33879,xrap,2007-02-13 03:13:00,683,30+ for hamilton because of the winds coming off the lake. Blizzard liek conditions and visibility at 0. Sounds like no school  Although last time they said that I woke up to 2 cm of snow and 3 inches of ice.
33881,kennyman,2007-02-13 03:18:00,737,"Well,we had to get it sometime. It'd be weird actually if we got lucky all year. I thought the west coast was going to keep it LOL ...... it was their turn. Hopefully all we get is some good toboganning and everyone uses their heads. I hope it's all cleared up for the fishing show. I'm ""Jones'n"" for something fishing related.  Everyone take care tomorrow (no power outages please). It's funny, I used to freak just thinking of that thought when I had a saltwater tank (corals etc.). I gave it up for a projector and camping/fishing. I figured I ALWAYS had to be here to take care of it and with camping etc. I just couldn't do it. I was fun too though,just way more time consuming, more stresssful and less filling LOL (actually I haven't kept ANY fish yet,but the Walleye are calling me) LOL.."
33897,douG,2007-02-13 04:07:00,2693,"UA1990, Toronto to New York is more like 553 Kms.  200 klicks might get you to Deseronto.  Irregardless, we gonna get some weather."
33899,xrap,2007-02-13 04:10:00,683,  553.3 Kms to be exact
33901,irishfield,2007-02-13 04:16:00,26272,"Doug, I think you should head into work now...sleep on your desk..so you're on time in the morning.! LOL"
33902,~CK~,2007-02-13 04:29:00,30,"Hmm.. and just in time for Valentine's day... I guess there's no point in me getting my hair done, lol. The wind and snow will just undo it in two seconds.  PS- I like the new smilies. I might have to borrow Davey Crocket's hat up there to keep warm. Either his or Uncle Buck's white one. Not only warm but apparently lucky."
33937,Whopper,2007-02-13 12:15:00,2174,"Well we've had a winter storm warning since Saturday and it finally got here after midnight last night. They had pretty much cancelled everything here last night before it even got here Got up at five and shoveled the first six inches of what supposed to be 10-12"" today. I was getting ready to leave for work and all my guys called off so I'm thinking what the point, looks like I'll have to find something to do today  Whopper"
33958,Dartee,2007-02-13 13:30:00,47,Well so far they are only calling for 10-15cm for the Brockville area Wed. but the 30Km/hr winds will make it just lovely.  I feel a sick day coming on.  At least we wont get what upstate NY got last week. Oswego area has 12ft+ snow drifts
34039,OhioFisherman,2007-02-13 16:21:00,6623,"The wife got up at 5am around 6 the schools called and canceled for the day, better plan than last time, let them get to school and send them home at noon. Maybe 20 inches of snow from this system here. It`s not nice out now."
34071,lunkerbasshunter,2007-02-13 17:48:00,2585,drove in hamilton this morning and white out conditions and icey roads.  here in oakville its blowing but light snow.  weird how oakville east to pickering always seems to miss the squalls.  apparently when the storm rolls in we are not going to miss it.  oh well i have been dieing to use my snowblower this year!  Be safe if you have to drive all!  Cheers!

And another 20-30 from the storm and they said we can possibly see over 50+ because lake effect.. My back is going to hurt tommrow  Hope its a snowday. Woot woot, Too bad I don't got the cam to snaps some pics."
34198,lew,2007-02-13 21:00:00,12767," I saw that on the TV awhile ago xrap, you guys are getting clobbered.  Nothing in Toronto yet but it sounds like it's on the way.  Guess we can't complain too much though, the news said Toronto has received the least amount of snow this year ever."
33603,bigfish1965,2007-02-12 18:47:00,3382,Calling for 30cm of snow and blizzard-like conditions. Careful if travelling!! http://weatheroffice.ec.gc.ca/warnings/report_e.html?onrm19

33607,ricoboxing,2007-02-12 18:57:00,398, no it means you should plan on not going to work (cause of dangerouse driving conditions) and go fishing instead!
33609,ccmtcanada,2007-02-12 19:01:00,7971, DOH!! Why didn't I think of that...gotta go home and sharpen some hooks....LOL

33670,lew,2007-02-12 20:27:00,12767,"We've had it good here in Toronto this winter as far as snowfall goes, I think the weather channel said we've had a grand total of 9 cm, while everyone around here has gotten clobbered.  Kinda nice too, there's just too much traffic around here and it only takes a few inches to shut this town down.  We've dodged a few storms, hopefully we'll duck this one too.  The radio says we're only looking at about 10 cm for the Smoke....hopefully"
33674,Blake,2007-02-12 20:38:00,418,Hope not much here as I can't shovel with my back.  Oh well call someone in to plow I guess.
