35105,camillj,2007-02-16 00:19:00,1988,Well its been sooo long .. I thought I better practise .. to be sur eI know how  Here's a real nice keeper from last year around this time ... same place .... its my PB through the ice    With any luck we'll be able to beat it tomorrow
35200,discophish,2007-02-16 03:23:00,392,"That's an awesome catch for a Joe Laker!  It is unfortunate that I am breaking my 5th annual Joe weekend opener this year because of a miserable cold from the Simcoe chill last weekend.  The weekend of the 24th/25th I will be on the northern tip of Joe.  I am envious of your upcoming trip this weekend, and I wish you the best of luck!  It goes without saying that you are eager to try out the new gear.  I will offer you precaution about the cube we commonly own.  Be careful of the corners.  The stitching that mends the material around poles are poorly manufactured, and it's not reinforced.  We have torn 2 ends already.  It's an awesome design, and we love its portability ... just be careful when the winds are up.  Have a great weekend, and enjoy!  Let us know how you did ... and how much I missed out!"
35230,camillj,2007-02-16 04:51:00,1988,Thanks DP ... sorry to hear about your flu ... actually I just listened to a VMail from my bud who is complaining of the same thing ... tell's me he may have to cancel depending on how he feels tomorrow ... I told him to down a fifth of scotch and SUCK IT UP .... we dont cancel no ice fishing over the flu .... besides ...nothing cures a cold faster than freezing out on the ice .. cept maybe a fifth of scotch
35462,discophish,2007-02-16 20:48:00,392,"I think I would be too busy blowing my nose, and having to de-ice/detach the Kleenex from my face afterwards from the stick-freeze.  The ring from my headache would set off false alarms at my bells, causing my legs to work overtime from the squats while rising off the chair and to the rods.  The warming and cooling of muscles during this event will cause my body to cramp, and accelerate my bladder to pee every 5 minutes.  My zipper will break on the survival suit from overuse, and I will freeze.  I will trying picking my pants up from around my ankles, then fall into my hole head first like an ostrich in sand because I sneezed and slipped.  At that moment, the largest laker in Joe will be yanking at my line. Chomp Chomp Chomp ... and I will have an ""Aqua Vu"" vision with my head in the water to support the fact that I'm on the wrong side of the ice to do anything about it.     I don't want this trip to become another edition of my many incidentals ""The big one that got away"".  And If I drink scotch as you suggest ... the fish that got away would indisputably be 10 times larger than it actually was. <Nudging>     I don't want my standards set too high  Have an awesome trip ... and tell all the fish from the south to start swimming north.  I have treats to offer."
