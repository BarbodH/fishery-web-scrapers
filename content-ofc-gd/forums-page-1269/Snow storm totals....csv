35133,Fisherman,2007-02-16 01:03:00,7201,5cm/2 inches at best. No complaints.
35171,Cookslav,2007-02-16 02:08:00,1457,We got about 20-25 cm I figure here in K-town.  but it's hard to tell with the wind blowing up the drifts...some spots look more like 40cm but 20cm is a safe bet.
34720,Pigeontroller,2007-02-15 01:08:00,2793,"I think we got about 40-50 cm here in St catharines, schools were closed today."
34722,FinS,2007-02-15 01:11:00,463,we didnt get enough let it snow
34724,Mike Pike,2007-02-15 01:13:00,1332,"The 'Hammer"" got hammered!  Not sure of the final tally for Hamilton but our schools were closed, no garbage pick up, etc.  I missed work too.  The ploughs didn't get to my street 'til this afternoon so I couldn't get to work.  The only thing I saw moving this morning was a snowmobiler which is pretty strange in Central Hamilton!  lol"
34730,Guest Trophymuskie,2007-02-15 01:18:00,0,"Still snowing here we must be up to at least 10 cm.  Idiots canceled school buses today, roads were black still at 8:30 this am and somewhat snow covered by 3:PM."
34737,huntervasili,2007-02-15 01:28:00,1604,Probably 30+ in burlington... Some places with drifts metre+ and others less snow...
34742,Gerritt,2007-02-15 01:32:00,6129,"Up here on the mountain I would estimate an easy 60-70cm..... hell I have snow drifts that are taller then me! 6'1"" +...... I was outside for a good 10 hours today..... did 7 of my neighbours driveways and walkways..(elderly)...not to mention the sidewalks I did.... man am I tired.... but yeah we got clobbered!! I will take pics in the morning.   Gerritt."
34744,mason05,2007-02-15 01:33:00,258,About 20cm here. Alot of no shows today at work. Had a blast doing doughnuts this morning in our unusually empty office parking lot. The director wasn't too impressed with my antics....what gives?  Corn Nug

34758,solopaddler,2007-02-15 01:49:00,8605,"I work at the Hamilton weather office and the final the total for Hamilton is actually 53cm. I'm actually just winding down now....I went into work at 2pm on Tues., and my relief couldn't make it in to work 'cause of the storm. I was stuck there 'till 2pm today!  What a day!"
34762,cplummer,2007-02-15 01:54:00,165,the falls saw about 40 cm
34765,TJQ,2007-02-15 01:58:00,7806,What snow???
34771,Mike the Pike,2007-02-15 02:08:00,3421,Only about 15cms here so far and its slowing down.I don't think we will get the predicted 30cms.Mother nature gave most of it to Ontario.I guess I will use the snowblower for the 2nd time this winter.MTP
34773,xrap,2007-02-15 02:16:00,683,I live in Hamilton as well and we got alot of the white stuff. My sis stoped by right now and dropepd the camera off. The pics are crap cuz I couldn't see the screen. This is the afetrmath of the storm.  My driveway and the piles of snow   My backyard patio and hottub covered   Downstairs door   Too bad I didn't get the cam to snap the pics from before would of been alot betetr but this gives you a pretty good idea how much snow we got.
34775,Greencoachdog,2007-02-15 02:26:00,8163,We got a very light dusting this morning and I'm pizzed at each and every one of y'all for it!!!
34805,Guest mistyriver1,2007-02-15 03:20:00,0,"Not sure how much Dax, but enough to close the boy's school and take a ride around..............      "
34823,carll2,2007-02-15 03:59:00,443,here on the north shor of montreal we have 20cms and were done..the storm was way overrated..  btw mistyriver1 awesome pics take advantage of the snow
34893,nautifish,2007-02-15 13:39:00,1416,We got hammered pretty good  
34896,just2manylures,2007-02-15 13:42:00,144,She sure didn't let up in my neck of the woods either.  We got more than I would like.  Long range is calling for rain next week too.  How do you think that will make the driving?  Momma Mia  my 2 cents  2many
34963,lilkynan,2007-02-15 17:37:00,173,"I got stuck in Chicago on Tuesday night - !!! - a 2 hour drive the O'Hare took 7 hours in the storm there!!  Got pulled over by a Ranger noting we should stay off the hiway - told him we were from Canada, so he said - OK - on your way!!  Let it snow!!"
34967,TJQ,2007-02-15 17:50:00,7806, Ya... but what about the snow???
34991,Bob,2007-02-15 19:17:00,370,"We Might have had 30 cms total since winter started but none lately.  Cold though, or maybe just feels that way because we've been so spoiled this winter."
34992,bucktail,2007-02-15 19:19:00,1857,40-50 would be my guess in Burlington. Just finished digging out the boat!
35025,dustink,2007-02-15 21:00:00,526,"Not as much here in N. Indiana, but we had just over 10"" (25 cm), and a 35mph wind for almost 14 hours straight....got nasty pretty quick.  Everything was shut down Wednesday, and most things are back today.  But some of the Rural roads are still a bit tricky!  dk"
35063,Beans,2007-02-15 22:35:00,3339,Finally got around to shovelling the driveway (5 cars long x 2 cars wide) this afternoon...  My guess is we got 10 cm (4 inches) new snow on top of the foot or more already on the front and back yards except where the wind has drifted it higher...Not too much considering what others got...
