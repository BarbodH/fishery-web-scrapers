""In this photo provided by Darren Horness, Darren Horness of Howards  Grove, lays on the ice next to the 72-inch, 102-pound sturgeon he  speared Sunday, Feb. 11, 2007, on Lake Winnebago in Wisconsin. The fish  came up within 6 inches of the surface inside his ice shack, he said.  About 8,000 fishermen spearhunt sturgeon each year on Lake Winnebago  and its upriver lakes. In his seven years, Horness hadn't come close to  a fish that big.""  Full story at: http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070214/ap_on_...OJHTL_yDIlsaMYA"
34709,Gerritt,2007-02-15 00:48:00,6129,I dont know if I like this... they may be within their rights but I just doesnt feel right about it... Thanks for sharing Cliff...... but I dont agree with such practises.. that fish is probably 40+ years old... NOONE should be ice fishing for them... nor for that keeping them in softwater..... but if the regs say ok...???? I still stand by my conviction... this is wrong.  just my opinion   Gerritt...
34713,ccmtcanada,2007-02-15 00:59:00,7971,Hey Gerritt...that's cool...that's your opinion and I respect that!  I def see your point...I just posted it for interest sake.  Cliff
34714,dsn,2007-02-15 01:01:00,1018,I agree with Gerrit. You can't eat the thing why waste the fish? Let them live. Their suposed to a great fish to fish for. But not to kill.   dsn
34715,bigfish1965,2007-02-15 01:01:00,3382,"I guess if you are going to eat it then the harvest method is pretty much irrelevant as long as it is legal. I dunno if I would eat a bottom dwelling fish that old, however. Seems to me they are too few in numbers to harvest at all."
34760,GbayGiant,2007-02-15 01:52:00,1780,"Very nice fish, like everyone else I just don't see the reason to kill it (and are they spawing at this time ?), but I guess if your spearing it's a little hard to release the fish.   If it's for your ego, pictures are just as good, and wouldn't it be easier and more fun to just fish with a rod for them ?"
34779,fishindevil,2007-02-15 02:38:00,6254,"well thanks for posting that cliff,but i agree with you gerritt,it doesnt seem right to me.  ..but the regs say its ok...in that area so be it....but thats a very majestic fish and i sure wouldnt harvest one that way...i hjave been lucky enough to have caught one before and he was only 25lbs,and that was a huge fight in a 5mile per hour current so i will fish for them the way i think they should be caought with a good old rod & reel a few pics taken then released...cheers"
34782,ccmtcanada,2007-02-15 02:44:00,7971,Just so I'm clear on this one...I didn't agree with the spearing of this fish.  I just posted it out of interest.  Anyone who knows me knows that I'm a huge C&R guy and the spearing of a fish to me is unthinkable.  Cliff
34790,FinS,2007-02-15 02:55:00,463,thats a nice fish i believe these prehistoric fish shouldnt be speared but would be fun bringing up a hole with a ice rod
34791,fishindevil,2007-02-15 02:57:00,6254,"yes cliff i hear you and understand loud and clear,im with ya on that for sure   i have witnessed the spearing of fish before down near deseronto in the salmon river natives are allowed to spear walleyes,and i cant stand to watch so to me i would never want to partake in such activities myself...but thanks for letting us know about that...they say 8,000 angles how can there be any fish left at all,thats incredible isnt it.?????"
34806,kemper,2007-02-15 03:21:00,2232,"Interesting story, but I dont like the mass spearing of sturgeon."
34857,Rich Clemens,2007-02-15 11:25:00,3131,"No worries cliff ... matter of preference I guess.  So far, it looks like we're all on board with you and your thoughts.  But, it does sound legal ... sorry to say.  I sure hope he didn't waste it."
34874,jediangler,2007-02-15 13:09:00,1923,You had me worried there for a minute. I thought you had been ice fishing at Sturgeon lake in the Kawarthas.
34878,Northhunter,2007-02-15 13:12:00,214,"About a dozen of the 700 fish speared so far this year have topped 100 pounds, said Ron Bruch, a sturgeon biologist with the state Department of Natural Resources. The season continues through Feb. 25 or when the harvest limit is reached.  I guess they know what they're doing? Most seasons involve a draw - so it's not a free for all.  I read another article from Michigan where the limit for an antire lake is only 5 fish."
34884,Terry,2007-02-15 13:20:00,14456,"it is not something that I would want to do but it is legal, there is a quota....so who am I to judge...."
34946,Jigger,2007-02-15 16:26:00,1237,"Yeah, Northhunter, I remember reading those articles as well. Thats pretty crazy, though, taking over 700 fish, Sturgeon no less from a single waterbody. Not Perch, Sturgeon. Imagine 700 Muskie were taken from Scugog this winter?"
