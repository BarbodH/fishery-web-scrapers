I can not figure out how to put pics on net to show you guys my new F150 with my sponsor decals on it, You guys gave me great advise and it realy paid off. Iam know in talks with a local radio station to do fishing reports and have the rest of my truck decaled with there cool logo's. Picked up a pool place as a sponsor. Splender Pools here in Windsor. That was a great one. Just by doing what you guys told me to do. Please e-mail me to tell me how to get pics on site. jigger Bob Mann Sr."
