Yeah, that right a 19 hour flight to come here to Ontario to ice fish for a week!  (Feb 17 -24)  Anyways, I can only take off one day from work to fish Simcoe with them, but they have asked me to look for info regarding ice fishing on the bay of Quinte as they have never fished for walleye through the ice and would like to give it a try for a day.  Anyone here have any suggestions?     They are also from the Markham area looking for a weekday outing. Since I have got no knowledge of icefishing BoQ, I figured this would be the best place to ask.  They are willing to go with a hut operator (preferrably on the west side of the BOQ) but will need easy directions.  If anyone here wants to offer to show them around and help them out please PM me.  Thanks,  Stan"

34939,wuchikubo,2007-02-15 15:58:00,1114,Thanks Mittzu.  I'm surprised no one else is offering any more help.  I thought there were more BOQ fishers here.  Stan
35256,duber,2007-02-16 08:09:00,220,To find some hut operators and some more info on the bay go to quintefishing.com  You could get ahold of Ron at Skevys or Sam at Carra's Outdoors to see if they can set you up with a hut and or a guide.They are both members on this board.I could hook them up with a hut but I wouldn't be able to help them with the fishing as I have to work.
