The building next to the shop, was the RCR Museum. What a place! I could put up 100 pictures from that visit, but I'll just include two. The first is the right front tire from the car Dale was leading with at the 1990 Daytone 500. Going into turn 3 on the final lap, it blew & 4 guys drove by on the inside...    Do you remember the barrel-roll Dale took at Talladega in '96? He broke his collar bone & sternum & still walked away & even gave a 'thumbs up' on his way to the ambulance...here's what was left of his ride...    After that, I went to the North Carolina Auto Racing Hall of Fame & Museum. It was well worth it to stand beside Dale's 1979 Rookie of the Year car...    On the way to Atlanta Motor Speedway, I stopped in nearby Newton, NC at Dale Earnhardt Chevrolet...    Out Back was this kinda neat tribute...    We finally made it to Atlanta...    We had great seats, row 50 at just about the Start/Finish line!    I snapped this as Jerry Nadeau, Bobby Labonte & Dale Earnhardt were about to put Jeramy Mayfield a lap down. Mayfield blowing up...      With the checkered flag flyin', Dale comes home 2nd.    Shortly after the race, the 2000 Champion was crowned...Bobby Labonte.    I went to Charlotte Motor Speedway in October 2003 for my 14th Cup race...    Because it was a night race, the pictures came out kinda crappy, so I'll just include one...     I think that's it for now. I'm tired....SO, enjoy the race on Sunday. I'm still pullin' for Happy Harvick as he's bound to take Dale's old car to Victory Lane in Daytona sooner or later. I prefer sooner....  I hope you enjoyed this as much as I did reminiscing..."
