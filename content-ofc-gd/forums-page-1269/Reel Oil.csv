35258,danbo,2007-02-16 08:50:00,2646,Yep! Used to use 'em too.
35425,carp-starter,2007-02-16 19:22:00,253,"Hi danbo.  Guys, this is what I use. And it is also excellent for short lunch. I think Darryl  would approve and be proud of me.    I am sorry. I could not resist. At this time of the year one sometimes deviates from the norm and becomes a little bit silly.  "
