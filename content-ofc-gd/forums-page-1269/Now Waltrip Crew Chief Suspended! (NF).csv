34931,Joey,2007-02-15 15:27:00,9122,Looks Like Waltrip is in the hot seat now too.  Interesting.  Nascar Scandal  Joey
34932,muskieb,2007-02-15 15:29:00,58,"One way for him to get into the spotlight, racing hasn't seemed to do it for a while!  He is going to have an interesting year with everything going on."
34943,Whopper,2007-02-15 16:19:00,2174,If it would have been for DEI ole Mikey would have still been winless. If I'm not mistaken he held the longest wineless streak for current drivers until he won his first at Daytona.
34944,TennesseeGuy,2007-02-15 16:24:00,957,Mike's first win came on a sad day for racing.
34945,Joey,2007-02-15 16:25:00,9122,Winless or wineless Phil.  I still don't think he's done the latter  Joey
34953,spanky,2007-02-15 17:02:00,195,"i didn't read the link, but watched the press conference on Speed last night.... the VP of competition for Waltrips team has also been suspended indefinitely and the VP of competition for Nascar said that there might be further suspensions/ejections... would be curious to hear what DW has to say about it..."
34955,muskieb,2007-02-15 17:10:00,58,My first guess at what D.W. would say...  Michael is just an unfortunate victim of someone else's careless actions.  I often wonder how much of a career Michael would have if it wasn't for his big brother.  He sure props him up on a pedestal.
34956,misfish,2007-02-15 17:10:00,29133,"Well I seen this also last night and for the life of me,could not believe my ears. New player in the game,a vetran driver like Mike and they pull a stunt like this. Joey I dought he or they are innocent.  Sad to say but this guy needs to maybe stick with talking the game instead of driving in it.      Go JR."
34959,Bernie,2007-02-15 17:18:00,3190,"""Sad to say but this guy needs to maybe stick with talking the game instead of driving in it. dunno.gif""  ""Misfish""   I like Mikey but have seen drunks drive better than him.  Was at Michigan last year and he was in a collision. He backed up to go around and hit the guy ahead of him unintentionally."
34975,Whopper,2007-02-15 18:12:00,2174," LOL Joey  Old Smoke got more wins in a car this year than Mikey got combined in Nextel  TG you are correct it was a very sad day when M. Waltrip won his first race.  I was watching the truck practice at lunch time and Mikey was on saying he couldn't believe that one of his crew was caught trying to make up for a ""oil problem""  Man those trucks are right on the edge at 189mph three wide  I will have to one thing though I just read an update and Mike isn't ducking anything and is taking full responsiblity so that's kinda of refreshing."
34998,TennesseeGuy,2007-02-15 19:32:00,957,In all sports the cheater is fired if the top level was not in on the cheating activity.  When top level people are aware of what's going on they protect the offender and keep him around.  That's usually the deal as it's laid out from the beginning.
35013,crusty,2007-02-15 20:11:00,83,"I wasn't sure if there were any NASCAR fans here, but now I know. The wife was able to purchase tickets for Montreal section 1 row dd In the waltrip stands overlooking the pits/start line cost 140 american for the whole weekend which includes the Mercedes race I think drinking is in my furture Any one else going to support the idea of nascar in canada?"
35016,spanky,2007-02-15 20:18:00,195,"i personally think the bigger issue is Little E possibly leaving DEI if he doesn't get his majority share of the company... and you gotta love Richard Childress' comment ""No one would wanna see Dale Earnhardt Jr. in the black #3"".... the last 2 weeks have been crankin' it up, getting exciting"
35019,TennesseeGuy,2007-02-15 20:30:00,957,"Racing should work in Canada.  We'll know more after August 4.  Gotta buy tickets.  For sure, better than Mexico.  Early August 4 I fly from one lake in NW Ontario and will be fishing another lake by 11 a.m."
35093,Bernie,2007-02-16 00:00:00,3190,I love the idea of NASCAR in Canada..But to drive to Montreal to watch a Busch road course race...hmmmm dunno yet. Watkins Glen would be about the same distance for me and it would be a Nextel race.  Plan to go to New Hampshire this year for the first time...Nascar weekends are unbelievable. Last year a bunch of us went to Bristol and Michigan for our first NASCAR experience. The people were there to have fun and there were no harsh words spoken or arguments at either event that we seen. Pretty amazing considering the amount of people there.
35110,walleyejigger,2007-02-16 00:22:00,876,"i'd enjoy racing alot more if they had a race in northern ontario in the middle of winter, see how good of a driver they really are, how fast they can pit in -35 degree weather  GO JR. GO"
35130,MuskyBill,2007-02-16 01:00:00,311,"The bigwigs at Toyota won't be liking this news, especially because of the ethics involved...shame on Uncle Mikey's team!"
35161,danc,2007-02-16 01:58:00,4677,I go to the Kansas race every year. What an awesome 4 days it is.  
35173,irishfield,2007-02-16 02:08:00,26272," Don't be surprised if the ""bigwigs"" at Toyota knew, since they seem to be having some real trouble making horsepower and keeping engines together."
35182,oxcowboy,2007-02-16 02:26:00,544," Amen nipsing, been to both of those tracks and your are exactly right, everyone is there to have a good time,  sure you will get the normal razzing about drivers but it's all in fun.  i think thats what makes nascar so great, so many people their all to have a good time, and very seldom have i seen anyone get too far out of line."
35189,TennesseeGuy,2007-02-16 02:42:00,957,"Yep.  Racing fans are among the most loyal and patriotic that you'll find.  They might blow a little smoke in your face or leave a few empty cans by their seats, but they won't leave you stranded along the highway."
