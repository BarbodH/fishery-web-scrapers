35318,Raf,2007-02-16 13:45:00,3495,Are any of the vendors selling LARGE muskie sized spinnerbaits?  I am thinking of Grim Reapers and others that size and up.   JBs hasn't had any in stock for a while.
35321,lew,2007-02-16 13:49:00,12767,JB's has the 950 Grim Reapers in now Raf for $20 with a pretty good color selection.  He's also got some of the HUGE Beavers too......$45.......I think.
