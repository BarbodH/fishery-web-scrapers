35030,Big Cliff,2007-02-15 21:15:00,6899,"I don't know how many times I have heard ""my family comes first""! Well, without a job what are you going to do to take care of your family, go on welfare? I've never had to do it but I have seen families that did and it wasn't a pretty sight!  Over the years of running my own business I don't know how many times I had an employee call in "" I have a headache so I won't be in today"", I was out until 3:00 am so I'm not feeling well I'll see you tomorrow"", ""My girlfriends want to go to Niagara Falls and I want to go with them so I won't be in tomorrow........."" They didn't care if customers orders weren't being shipped or bills weren't getting sent out. Those were the same employees that were all ticked off when it came time for a promotion or a raise and they didn't get one. The people that got ahead were the ones that took their job seriously, believed that they had a responsibility to the company and to our customers and they earned the promotions and raises. They were also the ones that had job security!  So if you really don't care about your job then why would you expect your employer to care about you????????"
35031,Puckhead,2007-02-15 21:17:00,377,"Ray, this is your boss.  Get back to work."
35036,pigeonfisher,2007-02-15 21:31:00,696,"I read in a book once  ""life balance is great, when times are great.  When times aren't great then you need to work harder.  Come in early, stay later, work harder do the things now that will once again give you life balance in the future""  As Clampet stated.  You can be fired at any time without reason, you may have to be compensated but you can be fired."
35137,raysfish2005,2007-02-16 01:14:00,163,"Well i love to open the can!!!!  To make a long story short( i typed a hole page) I'm going to Mexico!!  My boss pulled me into his office and gave me the time off, i counter'd with i will give up a week when i'm intitled, he said it was ok just make sure your back on time.  Life is funny !!!"
35143,Big Cliff,2007-02-16 01:22:00,6899,Guess you are glad I'm not your boss! I hope you enjoy your trip and realize how lucky you are!
35241,camillj,2007-02-16 05:36:00,1988,... dont forget your twinrix
35242,camillj,2007-02-16 05:38:00,1988, Hey Wayne ... I like the way you think
35299,fisher,2007-02-16 13:12:00,451,"If I were you I'd bring your boss back some cohibas, oh sorry that's Cuba.  What is Mexico known for - make it Tequila."
35328,JerseyDog,2007-02-16 13:55:00,190,I would take a run at the bosses job.
35442,raysfish2005,2007-02-16 20:04:00,163,"LOL jersey dog  Thats what i intend to do when i get back, Big cliff...........i hear you.........i have been on the other side of the coin as well, In the corprate world when you challenge someone above you, one one can survive..........never both.  But its off to Mexico for me, now to find that speedo!"
35447,Raf,2007-02-16 20:08:00,3495,you mean you'd rather go to mexico than fish those lakers ray? what's wrong with ya?  enjoy your trip!!
35448,Guest mistyriver1,2007-02-16 20:11:00,0,Have a good trip Ray !!
35451,Rich,2007-02-16 20:20:00,3927,I'd go. It's Mexico man. Just dont you dare come back without pics or we'll fire you from OFC
35472,Puckhead,2007-02-16 21:07:00,377, hahaha ... nice!
34968,bigbuck,2007-02-15 17:51:00,2449,"Better to not go and say you did. Send the wife if anything. ""You should always know where you are going to land if you jump."" If things are so acrimonious with your boss/supervisor, find another job THEN say bye-bye. A free trip worth a few grand is not worth losing a job that pays more than that."
34978,samson,2007-02-15 18:27:00,8,go for it. you only live once
34980,Puckhead,2007-02-15 18:43:00,377,"I'd suggest you start looking for a new job - if all of this is happening within your first year, you aren't going to be kept around much longer anyway.  If someone is exceptionally valuable to the company, employers will tend to make exceptions in these situations - happy workers are productive workers.  Doesn't sound like exceptions are being made for you which means you are either expendible, or are making yourself expendible.  Ergo, you have no job security.  Find a new one and if you feel like forcing yourself to the curb to get the ball rolling, go to mexico.  That's the best I can say from the other side of the fence with the limited info you're providing."
34984,Headhunter,2007-02-15 18:57:00,5703,"This is a very interesting question, but I doubt your gonna be very happy with my answer! Unless the vacation allotment and method of accruing time off was hiden from you at the time of offer signing, you have made a committment to the company and the company has in good faith paid you for your time and efforts. An employee that respects their employer, will in most cases receive that level of respect atleast, back in return. I'm wondering why you have not approached HR as of yet? Going over your bosses head can be career suicide! Typically, you accrue time off based on time worked, in many cases 1.5 days per month worked. I understand that the earlier time off was without pay and to my mind, they've already gone above and beyond your contract to keep you, the employee happy. Should they again, allow you un-earned time off, they will be creating a huge preceived inequity with the other employees. I'd say your already lucky to have gotten what you have! Perhaps you should really consider some much larger life/career questions, for example; -am I happy in my job? -where do I want to be in 5 years and will this position help to get me there? -is my resume up to date? You may find that regardless of what decision YOU make, the company may take the decision making process away from you! They will certainly be looking at your performance for the next while. If I was your boss and you had come to me with these requests, I'd certainly be thinking twice about whether to send you for up-grade training, or give you the big juicey project that must be delivered on time! In short, your gonna have to earn their respect again. Either decision you make, I'd be getting my resume of to snuff, the choice may not be yours to make. HH"
34987,douG,2007-02-15 19:03:00,2693,I don't see any dilemma.
35000,irishfield,2007-02-15 19:33:00,26272,"Well put Cliff/CS/Joe....great to see some others with the employer prospective around here.  Ray...send her off with one of her girlfriends, or hell some young stud...then get a sitter and go fishing on the Sunday while she's gone."
35002,ryanheritage,2007-02-15 19:41:00,180,If your boss threatens you with your job you can just let human resources know and it will be end of topic. Talk to HR and they will advise you properly. Don't quit or go without giving notice on paper. You can go if you give proper notice and hr is aware. And you need a written warning for insubordanation <spelled wrong. and after your first written is when you can be dismissed. so go come back to a letter and and tell your boss to eat a d**k
35010,douG,2007-02-15 20:01:00,2693,Hmmmmmm.  Duck a l'Orange.
35011,irishfield,2007-02-15 20:01:00,26272,"LOL Bookoobeast...if I told him he couldn't go and he went anyhow...the only thing he'd come back to is an ROE and his last pay cheque. You'd have to take it to the labour board to dispute the fact he wouldn't be getting a weeks severence, for his less than year service either, since his termination reason would be insubordination as far as I would be concerned. Employers don't owe you a living.  In the first three months you can terminate anyone and not even give them a reason. Less than a year you can do the same with nothing more than a weeks wages as severence."
35020,ryanheritage,2007-02-15 20:34:00,180,aawwww so your a mean boss lol I know but the aggrevation that it would cause would put a big smile on my face   especially if I had no job and some extra time on my hands. I do know that before a year is up u don't get that much respect at the office but if you ask for the time off well in advance but get threatened with your job I do know that is not allowed. All I think is he should travel all his paths before he decides to go. But if he has a boss like that then I would find a new job anyhow. Oh and I would send pictures of my trip to the boss and show him how little I care.. Dosce cervaso por foi vore!!!!!
35022,irishfield,2007-02-15 20:46:00,26272,"""Mean"", tolerable or a great boss is all in the eyes of the employee...oh and how hard they really want/need/enjoy to work. Yes I have over 2000 EX employee files in 2 - 4 drawer legal filing cabinets from the last 21 years, half of them would rate me mean, 1/4 tolerable and 1/4 great...and YES we still have a large handful of employees that have worked for us for all of those years that are still very happy. They've watched my kids grown up and I theirs, I played baseball with them as a team (to further the team spirit at work), their spouses and kids are greatful (and tell us so) for what their spouses have EARNED for them....with the opportunity I offered them years ago....to grow with the company...be promoted from within etc.  Ray...you got your bags packed yet? LOL"
35027,Headhunter,2007-02-15 21:03:00,5703,"Well said Wayne! Funny how many of us think a certain way, until we are put into a position to be a supervisor, manager or owner. I'll admitt, I too thought the way some others do about their employer, until I became a Manager, then it all became very clear! Just remember, we are all replaceable, it's a given in todays job market that employees are transitory. They stopped making gold watchesabout 15 years ago!LOL Just take a look at the ""Lame Excuses"" thread... gives yah a pretty clear picture!  HH"
