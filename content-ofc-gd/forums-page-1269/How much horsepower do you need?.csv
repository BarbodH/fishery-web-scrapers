34882,jediangler,2007-02-15 13:19:00,1923,Here is a pic I found this morning on myfishingpictures.com. He must have the strongest transom ever made. 
34886,Grimace,2007-02-15 13:23:00,2020,I love it.    If six break down you still have Two to get back to shore with
34887,Terry,2007-02-15 13:26:00,14456,yeah but he needs it he pulls 2000 water skiers  all at the same time
34889,just2manylures,2007-02-15 13:33:00,144,Just like those crazy guys in their bass boats.  Whats the point of having a boat that goes 90mph?  Be a fun ride I bet  my 2 cents  2many
34929,Bernie,2007-02-15 15:19:00,3190,Would have been a lot less money if he just used 3 E-tecs or 4 Verados
34952,kennyman,2007-02-15 17:00:00,737,"He needs that much horsepower to pull all that gas LOL. WOW!! How much gas would that use an hour? They might as well use a couple blown big blocks or a couple turbo deisels? I think he probably just has too much money and is ""one upping"" all his buddies.  It's either that or it's US Government LOL. I have to admit it looks ""monster truck cool""."
34957,charlesn,2007-02-15 17:15:00,551,I'm jealous!  I only have 1 outboard.  Definitely feeling HP envy.  Charles
34958,douG,2007-02-15 17:15:00,2693,"Looks like a Coast Guard or Marine Rescue boat to me, similar to the one we saw off Port Credit that nasty Sunday in August."
34960,Headhunter,2007-02-15 17:23:00,5703,I wonder how well that baby trolls down? Back trolling would be fun as well! HH
35017,crusty,2007-02-15 20:23:00,83,My guess would be dope runner
35078,GbayGiant,2007-02-15 23:22:00,1780,"Haha, that's a go-fast boat for the drug runs to Miami. Imagine trolling for muskie in the prop wash of that."
35084,irishfield,2007-02-15 23:38:00,26272,Punt/tug for pushing ships around in port...or for pulling fishing nets around.
35096,walleyejigger,2007-02-16 00:05:00,876,isn't a kicker supposed to be smaller  edit... i guess that's the one instance where a console would be better than a tiller
35146,silveradosheriff,2007-02-16 01:27:00,1025,Wonder what he has on the front?
35156,lunkerbasshunter,2007-02-16 01:44:00,2585,i was going to say tug boat but not really efficeint.
35159,Greencoachdog,2007-02-16 01:55:00,8163,  Save The Bales!!!
35216,joonmoon,2007-02-16 04:25:00,528,I wonder how many I could on the back of the AGUSTAWIND. Hmmmm. Can you say overkill.
35219,mepps,2007-02-16 04:31:00,1301,Probably costs $100 in gas just to start her up!
35221,kemper,2007-02-16 04:36:00,2232,"hmmm, a thousand horsepower eh. Thats impressive.  My car's got 300, and I thought that was fast..."
35226,Tybo,2007-02-16 04:45:00,1373,Don't think it's cable steer.
35227,young_one,2007-02-16 04:46:00,620,What's the insurance on that thing?
35414,Fisherpete,2007-02-16 18:22:00,1814,Actually Kemper 8x250 = 2000 HP!!!!!  I think he needs more LOL!  Fisherpete
35461,DanTheMan,2007-02-16 20:43:00,257,"LOL,  Now thats a boat.Anybody up for a sky"
