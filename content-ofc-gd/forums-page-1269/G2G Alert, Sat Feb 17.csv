30890,douG,2007-02-05 03:35:00,2693,"I have it on good authority that there will be a swill at Arizona after the show closes.  This is where we met last year, a handy place to the Show location, and close to the highways.  The place is very large with lots o room for us until the locals arrive around 10.  Arizona is also known for its very talented staff.  There is no need for reservations at 6 on Saturday eve, but it would be a good idea to let others know if you want to stop by.  Last year there were about 25, including dignitaries up the wazoo.  I doubt that they will grace us with their presence this year, but I think that will be an improvement, pompous !@#$%%$.  Good wings and nachos, mebbe a draft by accident, wonderful service.  Even Greencoachdog has been there.  See you around 6 pm in on the 17th."
