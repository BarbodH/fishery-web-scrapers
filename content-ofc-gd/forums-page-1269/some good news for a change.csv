35034,speedtroll,2007-02-15 21:26:00,52,"I know a lot of you have been wondering how Chris has been doing and I apologize for not being able to be around more but we had some wonderful and quite unexpected news from the doctors at Sick Children's last week.  He went through his monthly battery of test (CT, MRI bone, blood etc.) They found that the tumours have shrank significantly.    They have no explanation. I am just thanking God and everyone who is praying for him as I am very sure that it helps. He is doing quite well considering he is still taking chemo treatments. He is not out of the woods by any stretch and the chances for a full recovery are still very remote, but it is sure better then the news we were getting before Christmas.  I want to thank all of you for the PM's and the emails and most of all, the prayers.  Take care  Speed"
