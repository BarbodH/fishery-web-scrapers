34856,Rich Clemens,2007-02-15 11:20:00,3131,Hey VG ... I knew you had more pics and I'm enjoying each and every one.  Kinda sad to see the burning of the rainforest there.  Less and less each year I would guess.   Taking a look at that Payara - that guy's got a very serious set of teeth there.  That fish could do some damage if he got hold of you.   A real envyous trip for ya and glad you're sharing it with all of us.   Will there be a Brazil #3 ?

35204,vanillagorilla,2007-02-16 03:30:00,46,"To answer your question Tony, due to the extreme heat in the Amazon (100C in the shade @ 8:00am) most of the critters sleep during the day.  As a result we did not come into contact with any unwanted critters.  The only undisirables were the red ants.  We sprayed Deep Woods Off on everything in and on our tent (including our beds) and fortunately they never got a bite."
