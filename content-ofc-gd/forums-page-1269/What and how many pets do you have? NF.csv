31224,~CK~,2007-02-05 21:41:00,30,"I had 3 cats at one point.. one was a white tabby with silver and black patches of spots and stripes on her, then I was given 2 kittens from a friend.  They were sisters, one a black and white tabby and the other an orange and black calico. It got to be too much to take care of them all, and the first one was getting older so I gave her to a nice family to live out her days and I kept the kittens. Well, the little orange and black calico just would not grow, her teeth broke easily and she hardly ate but pee'd everywhere except the box. I took her to the vet and found out she had feline leukemia. It broke my heart and i cried and cried but there was no way I could afford to take care of her, so I gave her to the Humane Society. I believe they put her down because she was too sick. So now I just have the black and white tabby left. Her name is Jinx, and she's definitely a handfull. Right now, she is starting to pee all over the house like her sister did and I am getting worried that she may have the same disease. I took her to the vet but he couldn't tell anything and I have to get all these tests done. I really don't know what I am going to do with her. If I have to have her put down I am going to lose it. She's been my little baby for the last 3 years and has been with me through many ups and downs. Whenever I am sad or upset she always comes running just like a dog would to comfort me and try to cheer me up. She's the friendliest, purrr-iest cat you'll ever meet in your life. I just wish I knew what to do.  Here is a pic of the 3 cats snuggled together.. this was in 2003.    This is the older cat ""Tula"" and the calico tabby ""Chubby"" that she took to mothering.    And this is my baby kitty ""Jinxie"" who I am afraid may be sick right now.  "

30110,Markystang,2007-02-02 18:46:00,131,"nautifish- Your pics choked me up for a second... I had to get rid of my two birds last year. I had a male Nanday Conure and a female BlueCrown Conure since they were babies. Unfortunately I had to get rid of them as they really weren't good with my kids. I'd had the birds for probably 5-6 years before the kids were born, so they were quite used to my wife and myself. Then the kids came along, and kids are curious... After the kids got bit a few times, I decided it was better to find a new home for the birds than for them to live in isolation out of reach of the kids.  So now we just have the two dogs and a few African Cichlids. We have a male German Shephard/Yellow Lab cross, and a female German Shephard/Doberman cross. The fish come and go to quickly to take stock of what all I have..."

30416,nautifish,2007-02-03 18:48:00,1416,Hookset do u have any pictures?  The females tend to be a little smaller than the males. I had a B&G When i was in Europe. Also and African grey that had been badley abused. Was really nasty when he came  home to me but after six months you would never have believed it was the same bird as you can see from the picture. My B&G was the first macaw i actually hand reared myself and weaned alot of hard work but well worth it for sure.  Birds can be easily sexed now all you need to do is have a avian vet remove a blood feather they send it away have it dna tested usually get the reults back with in a week along with a certificate. Which i have for most of mine.      Malcolm how come you no longer have ur green winged.  I love the Macaws they are great birds.
