34933,POLLIWOGG,2007-02-15 15:31:00,835,"The only thing I could think of would be they suspect someone might hide a repair job with an affiliation patch or breach the waterproofing if there is any. Some jackets floatation material would be sealed in plastic bags , maybe they think these could get puntured. I can only guess."

I'd think it could void any warranty claims, plus an insurance company could have something to say if anything happened and a safety device didn't work as it's sposed to, and they found it had been somehow altered ??"
