34554,hawkeye,2007-02-14 18:00:00,162,"I was 63 last year, grey hair (what's left)  and all that, but I got carded in some airport bar. They said they carded everyone, no chance of anyone yelling discrimination here."
34600,kemper,2007-02-14 20:30:00,2232,Interesting how you can get carded at 35 but friends of mine that smoke (16-17 years old) can buy smokes.  Interesting system we run here.
34612,fishergirl72,2007-02-14 21:06:00,455,"Well Congrats on the one week, at least you are doing it, I am still considering it.LOL"
34614,fishergirl72,2007-02-14 21:08:00,455," Well now IT has to be something in the air.LOL   First it was Rick and I that got carded and now you, well maybe all three of us will take that as a compliment. I have been carded more now then when I was underage."
34652,FishHeadRic,2007-02-14 23:00:00,226,"Hey fishergirl72, My 35th is next Saturday and I still get carded all the time! It is getting tiresome but yet still flattering. It only really gets annoying when I don't have my ID with me and get turned down!!!  FHR"
34671,danc,2007-02-14 23:30:00,4677,I got carded in a Cameron Missouri Walmart last fall while buying a carton of Marlie Lights. I was 48 and I was flattered.
34799,fishergirl72,2007-02-15 03:16:00,455," I know what you mean, I get annoyed but yet I am flattered but exactly to what you said, if you don't have your ID on you, well then you are screwed. I went today to the same store and this time I didn't get carded, but I was waiting.LOL"
34913,MJL,2007-02-15 14:10:00,2427,"Come to think of it, most of the people I fish with who I met on OFC look younger than 18.  DSN, Victor and Greg (formerly Grilw) would be a pedaphile's dream.  I've been 16 for the last 7 years at most bars and anywhere where you'd need an ID."
34941,pameladallaire,2007-02-15 16:07:00,470,"I had that happen 5 years ago, when I was 42!!  But it is only people a lot older than you that think you are young.  I happen to dress comfortably in the trendy sweat pants and new fleece shirts.  They look at the clothes and don't look carefully at the face.  Everyone on this board probably looks young in their survival suits.  Hee hee.  Pam"
34947,Joey,2007-02-15 16:40:00,9122,"Its funny, I never got carded UNTIL I turned of age  Joey"
34948,Castmaster,2007-02-15 16:51:00,86,Yeh  me neither! Was going to the local watering hole at age 16. Was fun going in on my 19'th B-day and asking for my free drink!
34334,fishergirl72,2007-02-14 02:32:00,455,"Well I thought my days of getting carded for proof of age was over a long time ago but what happend today showed me I was wrong! LOL   Fishindevil and I went and stopped at a local store today and he told me to get 2 packs of smokes and something was telling me to take my purse inside with me, but I just placed it on my seat and went ahead on in. Well when I told the male clerk what I wanted he asked to see some ID! I asked him to repeat himself and when he told me the second time, I asked ""are you kidding me""? and he said no.LOL  So I left the store and headed to the car to retrieve my purse and Fishindevil asked what was going on and I told him that I was being carded. Well he laughed and said that was a good thing. I went back inside and showed him ID. After I paid for them, I told him that I am going to be 35 next month, and he said that I looked younger then 25 and that is why he carded me. Well I said thanks and I will take that as a compliment   and left. I mean I knew and was told that I looked younger than my age but 10 or more years younger? Well needless to say that made my day maybe even my week.   At least I know now that my days of be carded are not over just yet!"
34339,Roy,2007-02-14 02:52:00,13728,The 'male' clerk prolly hadn't noticed that your honey was in the car and was just trying to make you feel good. I can still get on the bus at half price.
34341,fishergirl72,2007-02-14 02:56:00,455," LOL, but dang making me walked back to the car in that cold just to make me get my ID, he could have said don't worry about it and just let me buy them anyways.LOL"
34342,bigfish1965,2007-02-14 02:57:00,3382,Weird..I got carded today too. I looked at her and said I was 42. She still wanted ID. It was in the car...I was really dumbfounded. I got her to ask a 20 yr old young lady working  in the store (the cashier serving me was mid 50's) how old she thought I was. The 20 yr olds never mistake me for under 25.
34347,fishergirl72,2007-02-14 03:01:00,455,Wow Rick that is werid! I guess we should both learn from this and bring our ID in with us.
34349,Pigeontroller,2007-02-14 03:04:00,2793,If you keep smokin' you won't look under 25 for long....
34352,fishergirl72,2007-02-14 03:08:00,455, That's true Pigeontroller. You are right on that one.
34353,GbayGiant,2007-02-14 03:10:00,1780,"I would consider it a compliment, I'm 26 and they never even think of asking me anymore since I was 16 with a fake ID."
34366,Pigeontroller,2007-02-14 03:57:00,2793,"I hear ya, i'm 33 and haven't been asked for ID since I was 15...  BTW Fishergirl, 1 week, no Colts. Been tryin' to quit for a year..."
34367,douG,2007-02-14 03:59:00,2693,"I'm WAY older and wiser than the both of youse  put together, but the best thing is that no-one can tell."
34374,Rich,2007-02-14 04:22:00,3927,I couldnt tell DouG you look just like a fresh young brookie to me!
34375,Castmaster,2007-02-14 04:23:00,86,Must be somethin in the air today cause I got carded for smokes today too> I'm 30.
34381,Clampet,2007-02-14 04:33:00,1947,"I guess we are never happy. When we are under age, everybody is saying:  ""No, no, yer too young"", so we can't wait to be older.  Then when we get older we want to be young (again). C'est la vie."
34386,Beans,2007-02-14 04:43:00,3339,"""I can still get on the bus at half price.""  Ya but Roy...They still won't let you on the roller coaster rides...  :rolleyes:"
34400,camillj,2007-02-14 06:06:00,1988,Beans ..  been watching you avatar for ya while you were away ... looks like you got a bite !!!!
34404,Guest skeeter99,2007-02-14 07:15:00,0,"I got the same problem with my wife  9 times out of 10 she will be carded at lcbo or beer store and bars, hell she has even been carded at east side marios I could not believe it and she is 33 years old"
34405,sturgman,2007-02-14 07:47:00,249,"Wish I had the same problem, nowadays I get asked if i have a senior citizen discount card. Im 35!!"
34407,sirfish,2007-02-14 09:57:00,175,How old dod the clerks seeing-eye dog put you at?
34409,Big Cliff,2007-02-14 11:09:00,6899,"Down in Myrtle Beach, four of us, all 60+ at TGIF's and the waitress carded us. (and she actually checked for the birthdate on my license). I thought it was some kind of a joke or promotion or they had a seniors discount or something but no. She said she carded everyone regardless of how old they looked  It was good for a laugh!"
34411,Greencoachdog,2007-02-14 11:21:00,8163,"I still get carded quite often... but then again, I'm only 23."
34435,Whopper,2007-02-14 13:14:00,2174, Didn't know ya had to pay to ride the short bus
34445,LeXXington,2007-02-14 13:34:00,1928,"I hate getting carded,,,   Drivers licence, insureace, ownership please"
34488,Garyv,2007-02-14 15:07:00,547,"Just wait, when your over 60 you'll start telling people that your younger, in fact once over 40 guys start telling women that their in their late 20's or early 30's !"
34499,Roy,2007-02-14 15:22:00,13728,I've never lied about my age. I've lied about my height lotsa times tho'.
34549,huey graphite,2007-02-14 17:42:00,362,My wife would have jumped in that clerk's arms and kinked me to the curb!
