34478,Smokey,2007-02-14 14:55:00,1278,The bite that happened just as the sun was setting in the horizon. First fish caught and released about 12 inches then the rest caught within 15 mins and then with a few to take home it was over.  All fish caught on a Green Mister Champ tipped with a minnow. I stopped in and got the minnows at Skevy's and he pointed me in the right direction to find the fish.  Sorry I didn't even have time to take pics on the ice as I was rushing to pack up before dark and didn't want to bother setting up the coleman lantern so I only got this one at home before cleaning them up.
