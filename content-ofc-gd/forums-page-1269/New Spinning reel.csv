35197,Hooked,2007-02-16 02:59:00,891,"If you want light, stay away from Diawa, they weigh aton for the size you want.  Depending how much you want to spend on a reel, but the 4000 series of Shimano's are ideal for what you are looking for.  You also might want to check out the Phflueger Trion or President, good reels and are under $100."

Also, for salmon or big carp, you need a reel with a strong twist-free frame & great drag. Anyway DAIWA HARDBODYZ are the best reels.  check this out  search here too"
