34817,Dondorfish,2007-02-15 03:45:00,1000,Hi     - does anyone know if lake simcoe got hit with the latest snow storm? Last thing it needs is more snow on the ice.    Don
34826,irishfield,2007-02-15 04:08:00,26272,I'm sure misfish or similar Barrie res has a quick answer...but we got no more than 2cm of fluffy stuff up here in Penetang Don. What a change that is!
34827,Dondorfish,2007-02-15 04:13:00,1000,Thanks Wayne. I am finally gonna get the new hut out Saturday morning and I hope that there isen't much new snow  - adds to the work.   Don
