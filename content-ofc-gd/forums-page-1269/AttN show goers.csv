For all who have been there, did you see if the lure making booth was at this years show?  I think this is the same fellow who runs luremaking.com.  I looked for them on the exhibitor list but didn't find them.  I need to get some blades for my famous inline spinners.  I took a 8 pound pike on one this year in Cook's bay and it really tore up the bait.  Thanks in advance for the info.  my 2 cents  2many"
