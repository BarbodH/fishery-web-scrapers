771773,Roy,2013-03-04 21:46:00,13728,I'll give you a hint here....the virus is on Betty's computer.
771775,misfish,2013-03-04 22:04:00,29133, Ya I just got another with a link.   Thanks bud. Doing a full scan now. How do you remove yahoo mail from your PC? Any idea?
771776,Terry,2013-03-04 22:09:00,14456,i would re move the virus
771780,Terry,2013-03-04 22:11:00,14456,I would download this and run it  http://trojan-remover.en.softonic.com/download
771789,Joey,2013-03-04 22:38:00,9122,"Ya, it looked to suspicious to open B.  No worries, happens to us all at some point.  Good luck getting rid of it!"
771791,solopaddler,2013-03-04 22:40:00,8605, I got one from Betty.
771792,irishfield,2013-03-04 22:42:00,26272,Half the people in my contacts seem to have this virus sending emails off their addresses. There'll be a whole slew of contacts in alphabetic order in the CC and it will be a link to something with no other text. Don't click it... or you're next!
771796,misfish,2013-03-04 22:49:00,29133,"Well Im clean,and now going through Bettys pc with the link from Terry. Sorry folks for the problems.   Really,hmmmmmmmmmm,she was never out of my sight,when we were at Spiels place.LOL Sorry bud."
771800,misfish,2013-03-04 23:00:00,29133,"RED FLAGS all over the place. All fixed now. Thanks for the help Terry.  If anyone gets another,please let me know.  B"
771804,misfish,2013-03-04 23:17:00,29133,"So how would she beable to send so many,when she dosent have those email addys on her pc? Also,is wireless safe? I have the straight connect from the wall,but she runs on wireless. Why, I have no idea. Should we both be on the land line?"
771806,Roy,2013-03-04 23:27:00,13728,She doesn't need a lot of contacts on her list. All she  would need is one contact who would open her email and that would infect all of those contacts and so on...they spread like wildfire.
771809,misfish,2013-03-04 23:32:00,29133,"Ya there were family names in the CC that I wouldnt have on mine. Ya know,the outlaws.LOL"

771812,Terry,2013-03-04 23:35:00,14456,glad I could help
771948,GreenCanada,2013-03-05 18:45:00,375,"It hasn't happened to me very often, but if I get a bug like what Terry has mentioned, quite often changing your password and then running a quality anti-virus/spyware program does the trick."

772006,Terry,2013-03-05 23:32:00,14456,I think C/NET is  a very safe site to download from  so don't be scared off people
772010,Musky or Specks,2013-03-05 23:50:00,2710,Stop using IE as your browser. I id it years ago and haven't had one virus since.
