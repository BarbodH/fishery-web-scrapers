771816,MCTFisher9120,2013-03-04 23:56:00,3761,I laughed at first but feel bad for ya. Simcoe has one of my cell phones but no fishing gear
771836,Pigeontroller,2013-03-05 00:50:00,2793,Since this conversation has dragged on this long...How deep?

771852,tedley,2013-03-05 01:36:00,36,I might drive out there this weekend to see how many holes are drilled there.
771865,jedimaster,2013-03-05 02:22:00,3472,With a camera you can see a hundred feet in all directions. Get out there. The purchase of a camera will pay for itself with one reel.
771580,Angler management,2013-03-04 02:39:00,280,"Dont get too excited, its at the bottom of lake simcoe... Any divers interested, PM me and ill give u the waypoints."
771594,e-z-out,2013-03-04 03:03:00,1052,Sorry to hear that been there done that. Rice Lake holds one of my Daiwa Steez Rod's and Reels.
771595,kickingfrog,2013-03-04 03:06:00,8333,With a camera and a big treble on a spoon you might be able to get it back no?
771596,irishfield,2013-03-04 03:07:00,26272,Amazing what you can get back out of 100FOW pounding a big 6/0 hook ! Took me 25 minutes to get my burner cover back last year! lol
771604,Nipfisher,2013-03-04 03:15:00,2449,how deep were you fishing?
771606,BillM,2013-03-04 03:20:00,17367,I would absolutely try and  get that back...  Get Terry out there with his GoPro (For beer or $$$) a giant treble some weight and go at it..
771635,wormdunker,2013-03-04 07:46:00,1711,"Good ideas with the camera & large treble hook.  Awesome!  To add to your suggestions.  Use a small diameter rope attached to a steel rod, hang several treble hooks off the steel rod.  My luck I'd hook & fish not the fishing rod!!"
771640,Angler management,2013-03-04 10:45:00,280,"Great ideas, but i sold my sled and its a long way out... If i did go back out, i would focus more on fishing then trying to hook a small ice rod and reel in 78fow. My luck, it would never happen! Already tried for couple hours when it happened.  44*28.098N 79*19.898W.  Best of luck if u think u can get it. Its about 15km from beaverton."
771642,fishindevil,2013-03-04 10:56:00,6254,Been there done that lost an ice fishing rid & reel combo about a dozen years ago and it was a stradic 1000 and $250 pair of Serengeti sunglasses too right down the hole !!!!!!! Tried for hours to get it and no luck !!!!!! So ya I feel for you ...
771643,lew,2013-03-04 11:03:00,12766,"I lost a Shimao V-rod and Curado reel over the side 10 years ago. I hooked on a large ""5 of Diamond"" spoon and was dragging that around the bottom trying to snag it.  Never got the rod & reel back but caught a 4 pound pickeral on the spoon instead."
771676,Angler management,2013-03-04 15:01:00,280,"Its funny because i made a comment in the classifieds few days ago, the guy selling the showdown had a pic using the core, and i commented,"" i thought i was the only one crazy enough to use a core on ice""... Definetly psyched mysel out!"
771684,BillM,2013-03-04 15:15:00,17367,"How did the reel end up at the bottom of the lake?  Please tell us it was an epic battle with a 30lb lake trout, lol."
771687,Angler management,2013-03-04 15:20:00,280,"Stood up for a stretch, and kicked it in the hole handle first..."

771699,BillM,2013-03-04 16:15:00,17367,"I'll get some weights, a long hose and see what I can come up with in the summer, lol!"
771703,Angler management,2013-03-04 16:23:00,280,"Best of luck! It has a nice 36"" rapala rod as well! And please dont rub it in my face if u get it. Its brand new, had it out twice..."
771704,Harrison,2013-03-04 16:24:00,2202," I did the same thing in a hut, but with a Mag lite in 15ft of water.  It landed beam up, messed the fishing for the night."
771706,BillM,2013-03-04 16:26:00,17367," LOL!   I was beign sarcastic.   Go talk to one of the divers that frequent the Barrie waterfront in the summer/spring..   Offer him a few bucks and a ride out to the waypoint, you never know!"
771722,chefboi17,2013-03-04 17:32:00,128,"I'm considering tapeing a rare earth magnet to the bottom of my ice rods, and carrying a small industrial magnet on a rope, just incase"
771728,bare foot wader,2013-03-04 18:15:00,1354,"that's a tough loss, I feel your pain...I've lost a cannon g11 in the boat, it wasn't so much the camera, that could be replaced...but my 32gb card, some of them were once in a lifetime pics that can't be replaced, it was a sit down and stare at the water without speaking for a few minutes, it sucked....i now backup all my pics immediately  i would think now is your best time to try to get it...drill holes in a grid pattern 10' apart and rig up something to try and snag it....you might get lucky and catch the line, rod and lure would be on bottom, line might be suspended and catching some currents"
771730,jedimaster,2013-03-04 18:37:00,3472,I was able to catch a radio in 80 fow using a cleo and my marcum fish camera a few week ago.    
771731,BillM,2013-03-04 18:43:00,17367,"Once the ice is gone, you've pretty much have a 0% chance of getting it.    If you can find it on an underwater camera, I'm willing to bet you could get it back."
771736,young_one,2013-03-04 18:54:00,620,"LOL! I stopped using my Core, I can feel your pain. Lost a GL3 Combo last fall..."
771749,camillj,2013-03-04 20:08:00,1988,I carry a ultra strong magnet on a long rope for just such occasions .. and especially...god-forbid ...car keys etc
771753,Angler management,2013-03-04 20:22:00,280,"The core is magnesium, magnets wont help."
