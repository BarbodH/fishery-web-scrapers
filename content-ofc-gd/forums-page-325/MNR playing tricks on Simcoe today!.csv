771977,Tayzak15,2013-03-05 21:28:00,318,"Right I agree with you, up in Timmins I get along with one of them, but maybe its because I'm young 21 years old that they always suspect were up to no good or they question us a lot more I have nothing against them I just feel its inconvenient sometimes and once in a while when they check it always seems that they question us young people more."
771982,misfish,2013-03-05 21:41:00,29133," What a crock full that is.. You really believe that???????????  I get drilled more when hunting,then I do fishing. And Im 48.I never take offence. It,s their job to ask questions."
771983,irishfield,2013-03-05 21:46:00,26272,"NOW NOW Brian... you know it's an age thing! They always ask the same questions, it's just now that you're old you don't care.. .when you were 21 you were paranoid that they were after you! lol"
771984,misfish,2013-03-05 21:59:00,29133,"Thing is Wayne,when I was 21,they were everywhere. Just like the cops. Well with me any ways.LOL"
771987,Tayzak15,2013-03-05 22:10:00,318,"Yeah, I get them when I'm hunting too although its not often. Its not a crock, when they have their checkpoints on the highway outside of Timmins once in a while were always getting held up longer than other people. Maybe its because they expect us to slip up? even though we are always legal. Like I said I have no problem with them just can get annoying when they try to make you slip up even though we are always legal."
771992,richyb,2013-03-05 22:20:00,774,We seen 5 CO's on sat and we had our limit of whities. They asked if we would mind if they had their dog find them packed away in our gear .. It was neat to see the dog find them. On sunday we seen a couple of the same CO's in the same spot and they were laughing as a quad with guys with no helmets were driving past us. I bet those guys werent laughing when they got nailed...  I know I sure was !
771994,discophish,2013-03-05 22:33:00,392," We were visited and issued a couple of ""drink tickets"" this past weekend up north in Muskoka.  Definitely not a rowdy bunch, just quietly fishing.  Weird how the OPP has different variations of their tolerances on the ice.  We specifically asked them how they deal with the different scenarios.  Apparently they allow alcohol in the hard huts, but since we had soft huts, it was a different case and considered “in public”.   Super nice guys, they were just out doing their job.  But it was a surprise to hear because I know guys have received tickets in the hard huts."
771996,Nipfisher,2013-03-05 22:37:00,2449,The C.O.s had a dog with them on Nipissing this weekend. My buddy said it was funny to see the dog in a sleigh. Dog never even got out. Now.....what would they be trained to find on Nipissing? Slot sized fish? lol.
772000,Roy,2013-03-05 23:00:00,13728,I guess you didn't read the thread.
772007,Nipfisher,2013-03-05 23:39:00,2449,"I read it, just wouldn't help if they could smell out herring or whities. Only OOS fish you could catch here during the hard water season would be bass.  I guess the ability to find consealed fish is why they have dogs."
772011,irishfield,2013-03-06 00:11:00,26272,Like I said... they ask if you have any fish first... let you say no and if you shift your eyes the wrong way out comes the dog from his snazy cutter. DId they have the pretty handler with the dog?? Almost worth hiding a fish...
772025,pidge,2013-03-06 01:36:00,438,"Well if that's the case Irish I'm Headin up your way and toe kickin some minnows around the hut lol. Just so I don't get myself in trouble they allow a few beer in ""hard huts"" but not the portable units?? I know the difference between the two, but really what is the difference?  I'm asking because yeah I do bring a few refreshments out, and have talked to CO's with beer in plain view and have never been bothered. This was in a rental wooden hard hut if that's what there considered. I don't get pissy with those guys and actually have never come actoss a prick. I realize they've got their job to do and I've never had a single issue. I've been stopped oh probably 7-8 times in my life...fishing only. Here I'm rambling, but can some one clearly give me a answer to the hard hut thingie please."
772111,Carp,2013-03-06 16:07:00,1488,"Yes, MNR dogs are trained to sniff out specific species of fish and game. They can tell the difference between the smell of a whitefish or a laker easily. Saw a very impressive display of what an MNR canine can do a couple of years ago. Each dog is trained to search for several scents, but if the officer suspects foul play for something his/her dog isn't trained to search for, they will call in another canine unit who is. No escape.  Nice to hear they're getting out there. Wish we had more of them."
772121,4x4bassin,2013-03-06 16:32:00,1025,"I'm glad to hear that they are really gettin out there and searching some of these guys , it can really be a zoo out there sometimes . On a side note I was fishing Lake Rousseau a couple years ago in a small back bay when I caught a pike , I quickly released it and continued to fish . Then with out notice this old beat up bowrider (and I mean old) came putting into the bay and pulled up beside me , well guess what it was CO asking me hows the fishing and if I had a license . He also said he was watching me and pointed to the front of the boat to his tripod scope and was waiting for me to start fishing before he made the journey across the lake from his hiding spot ! Of course everything was good and the pleasent CO continued on his way ."
772122,BillM,2013-03-06 16:37:00,17367,"Yup, really can't complain when the CO's are out and about.    People seem to complain regardless, by not being checked enough or being checked too much."
772126,duxbware,2013-03-06 16:55:00,102,"Google to Liquor Licence Act of Ontario. You can only consume alcohol in a residence, private place or premise with a permit. Definitions of residence and private place are also there. A fish hut ( clam type)  does not fall into any of those areas, however an ice bungalow with sleeping, cooking and bathroom facilities does.....What it all comes down to guys is that law enforcment officers have DISCRETION. One officer may hammer the fisherman having the odd beer where the as the other officer maybe give a warning. Its a risk we take when having the odd beer on the ice."
772158,davey buoy,2013-03-06 19:45:00,5505,"Well that's good to know ,if you have a beverage,be nice is your best friend."
772181,pidge,2013-03-06 21:44:00,438,Thanks Dubxware.
771849,NAW,2013-03-05 01:34:00,4022,"That was them!  As for the CO that stopped us, he was an older gentleman.  Very polite, and friendly.   So I guess the word ""trick"" may not be the best word to describe this.  I see it as a ""trick"".  Just like a clever speed trap, or the motorcycle cops who hide in the bushes with a radar in hand.  It's ""sneaky"".  Sure, they are just doing their jobs, and catching people who are breaking the law..  I get that.  I am part of a volunteer OPP K9 Unit, and work with enforcement on a regular basis.  And I know these guys where having fun setting up this little trap.  They likely did it 20 times that day.  And I bet you they handed out a few tickets too!"
771857,irishfield,2013-03-05 01:59:00,26272,This one of them Nick.. they drop by here from time to time just to keep me on my toes!  
771861,NAW,2013-03-05 02:09:00,4022,"Pretty sure that was the ambush officer..If you will!  He didn't have the tints on though.  Hard to be sure without seeing his eyes.  He never took his helmet off.  Same size, and shape."
771866,irishfield,2013-03-05 02:23:00,26272,You won't meet a nicer guy than Rick... unless of course he finds you with a bag of herring ! lol
771868,BillM,2013-03-05 02:41:00,17367,I'm pretty sure that's the guy that came by the house when my dad saw a moose with a broken ankle.  Told my oldman if he was still in the field the next morning to shoot it and he'd come down and bring him a tag.
771870,NAW,2013-03-05 02:50:00,4022,It's good to know they will do things like that.
771878,dhickey,2013-03-05 03:55:00,1038,Comon they know whats going on out there. I had a good chat with one not last weekend but the weekend before no problems and this past weekend they drove up to me saw me and drove away. They also sent more than a few packing up and headed for shore  I think its great to see them finaly.
771880,Tayzak15,2013-03-05 04:10:00,318,Catching you in the act of what exactly? just because you are leaving in no way should give them the assumption you are doing something illegal.
771881,BillM,2013-03-05 04:19:00,17367, Leaving as soon as the CO's show up?   That seems a bit odd no?
771882,Tayzak15,2013-03-05 04:24:00,318,Could be an emergency situation. SHouldn't be an admission/assumption of guilt.
771883,BillM,2013-03-05 04:26:00,17367," They are there to check your license, they can stop you anytime they want..     They don't have to assume anything."
771884,woodenboater,2013-03-05 04:30:00,2277," Seems the same as someone driving and seeing a RIDE spot check down the road, THEN making a quick detour down a side street to avoid them. Chances are, they're waiting down that street as well."
771885,Tayzak15,2013-03-05 04:35:00,318,"I turn away from those all the time, and never get pulled over. I don't want them wasting my time. However doing that in no way shows an admission to guilt, and shouldn't give them extra incentive to search you."
771886,BillM,2013-03-05 04:46:00,17367, You don't have 15 seconds to tell the officer you haven't had anything to drink?
771887,bare foot wader,2013-03-05 05:12:00,1354," There's no assumption or admission of guilt at all, they're simply doing their jobs...if you are fishing legally then you have nothing to worry about...the act of leaving when the CO's show up is suspsicion  I'm lucky enough to fish ON, BC, AB and SK(only once a winter) throughout the year....CO's are underfunded across the board IMO and resources are stretched far, they have tough jobs, it's always great to see them out in the woods/water  and I turn to avoid roadchecks sometimes, I've had them race after me twice...""why did you turn""...""didn't want to sit and wait for 20mins while you checked the 50 cars ahead of me""...ID, insurance, flashlight in the eyes and on my way...but I don't blame them for pulling me over, they're doing a job"
771888,Tayzak15,2013-03-05 05:29:00,318,"I don't mind talking to CO's or Officers if I'm not in a rush or they come and talk to me directly and quickly. Most of the time I don't like being bothered,nor do I feel like sitting around waiting if there is a lineup ahead of me."
771900,misfish,2013-03-05 09:55:00,29133, Yup.
771938,porkpie,2013-03-05 16:58:00,2521,"That's not a trick, that's smart enforcement!  Glad to hear they where out!"
771959,davey buoy,2013-03-05 19:52:00,5505,"If your doing nothing wrong,then no worries right?"
771963,Tayzak15,2013-03-05 20:12:00,318,"Right, but it can just be a waste of time, if you happen to leave while they are checking and they automatically give you a more thorough search/questioning."
771965,NAW,2013-03-05 20:16:00,4022,He spent less the 1 minute talking to us.
771967,davey buoy,2013-03-05 20:20:00,5505,"Maybe sir,but what are the odds of that happening on a daily/weekend?,happening more than once.I can see your timing ,but look at there perspective from the CO's view Just saying."
771968,irishfield,2013-03-05 20:22:00,26272,"  Stop and talk to them some time... you may just find out the current hot spot from them! Nothing to hide.. nothing to lose.. we even share our water and pop with them on Temagami to keep a good rapport going. Then a few days later, when they go by again and see the same collection of portables they just wave and motor on by.. unless of course they want to see the next monster we've caught. Year after year they stop to ask what we have saved on our cameras."
771971,misfish,2013-03-05 20:27:00,29133,"You would be correct Wayne. I first met Rick while we were at (then it was Harper tire) We talked for over a half hour about almost everything fishing and hunting. Met a few times on the water since,and even called for advise. It,s nice to know theres good guys out there."
771975,irishfield,2013-03-05 21:24:00,26272,I have many of their cell phone numbers Brian.. they even answer at home when off duty. Sure skips the 1-800-tips crap. Call direct and get it done. They all carry business cards BTW.. just ask for one when they are searching through your stuff !!
771592,NAW,2013-03-04 03:03:00,4022,"I was part of a little CO game today on Simcoe.   We where fishing a group of people.  One of many failed spots on a long loop around Simcoe.   I needed to get home, so we packed up and left.     We where driving thru the group of people heading home.  And saw 2 Conservation Officers with a K9 searching a portable hut.  We just kept on driving along slowly.  We pulled out of the group and accelerated toward home.  Not 30 seconds later there's a CO coming towards us waving us down.     This CO must have been riding along with the other 2.  Sitting back with binoculars, watching to see what guys pack up and leave when they see the COs checking huts.   He must have got a good vibe, because he didn't ask us to see any documentation. Sent us on our way.   And he also told us that KNOWBODY is catching whitefish on Simcoe."
771597,e-z-out,2013-03-04 03:07:00,1052,Did the K9 search the huts?
771599,BillM,2013-03-04 03:09:00,17367,"When I got checked a few weeks ago, CO said he hadn't seen a whitefish in two weeks..  As soon as he leave, wanna guess what I catch?  LOL!"
771600,NAW,2013-03-04 03:10:00,4022,"When we where driving by, one CO had his head in the hut.  The second CO with K9 was standing outside, ready and waiting."
771601,BillM,2013-03-04 03:11:00,17367,I bet there are a lot of people taking home herring
771602,e-z-out,2013-03-04 03:12:00,1052,"Fish, Drugs or Beer?  I find that strange"
771603,irishfield,2013-03-04 03:14:00,26272,Dog on Temagami knows the difference between a Whitie and a Laker. They ask you first if you have any fish.. so you can incriminate yourself.. before letting the dog go dig them out of the snow! lol Bet they're looking for herring.. no other reason to have the dog out there.
771605,NAW,2013-03-04 03:17:00,4022,"I could well imagine.  I am not 100% sure.  But I believe the MNR have dogs that are trained to sniff out fresh fish and game.  Heck, I think you could train any dog to do that!  And sure, they are always looking for alcohol and drugs. But I think the dog is there for fish (and training).  Edit...  Now that i see Wayne's post, that firms it up.."
771607,kickingfrog,2013-03-04 03:24:00,8333,No point in having a dog trained to sniff out fish sitting at home in front of the fire.
771609,Sinker,2013-03-04 03:51:00,8692,How do you know the dog was with the CO?  I have had the fish sniffing dogs go thru our gear on lake jow before.  S.
771627,pidge,2013-03-04 04:55:00,438,Just asking. Can a CO give you a ticket for beer on the ice or sittin at the side of a lake. I'm not gonna say I haven't and been asked by CO's before with beer in plain view for my fishing license. Just wondering while we're on topic. And yeah in what I've seen they've been out on Simcoe every outing I've been on this winter.
771679,NAW,2013-03-04 15:04:00,4022," I have lots of experience working with professional K9 units.  There was no question, this was an MNR K9 unit."
771688,irishfield,2013-03-04 15:23:00,26272,Yes the CO's where given the power to lay liquor offences charges a few years back. We never have booze on the ice.. but asked them outright last year what their thoughts were... and the CO and OPP both told us they considered a beer in a hut no different than a beer in a tent on the crown shore in the summer (and they can't lay a charge for that). Of course getting silly... and then driving your sled would have the same consequences as driving your boat!
771711,Acountdeleted,2013-03-04 16:49:00,2562,"So thats what they were doing yesterday on Cooks. I saw 3 sleds with what my buddy said was OPP in front of a hut, figured they were in a lot of trouble for that much attention."
771724,Fisherman,2013-03-04 17:42:00,7201,"We had one stop by yesterday morning at Innisfil, I don't think he spent more than 45 seconds with us, peek into the hut, saw two licences, wished us luck and off he went.  And polite to boot."
771725,Roy,2013-03-04 17:57:00,13728,It's probably the most efficient way to use what budget they DO have.
771768,ecmilley,2013-03-04 21:27:00,2163,"i guess they wouldn't play games if people wern't out there playing there own, good to see there out checking"
771797,SirCranksalot,2013-03-04 22:52:00,3291,"Maybe I'm slow, but where's does trickery come in?"
771815,pidge,2013-03-04 23:52:00,438,Did not know that Irishfield thanks for the info ill keep that in mind.
771825,NAW,2013-03-05 00:19:00,4022," Yep.  I am glad to see it.  The guy who stopped us was on a newer model sled.  Had a nice high quality new suite.  That really is what they need.  I remember several years ago, I saw a CO running Simcoe on a beat up old Tundra, with an old warn out, torn up suite.  I'm guessing that guy's normal shift is up north.."
771827,NAW,2013-03-05 00:25:00,4022," 2 COs roll in to a big crowd and have a third CO hang way back.  See who packs up first and leaves the area to avoid a spot check.  That's playing a trick in my mind.  If not, then what else would you call it?"
771828,misfish,2013-03-05 00:29:00,29133," Nick,was he a young lad? Did he have those wheels on the skis? Terry and I had a young fella come by last weekend. I showed him my PC print off lic. No prob.He knows theres a time thing going on with the system. We chatted and off he went. The way it,s to be. Hell,whats he going to think of to ole boys sitting and watching a video game.LOL Nice to see young blood out there.  As for the K-9. Buddy at work had them stop at his hut. Huge chocolate lab. Those dogs are trained smart. I can remember when they brought one to the hunt club. They stashed a bag of fish in the engine. Man I thought that dog was going to rip the front end apart."
771831,misfish,2013-03-05 00:33:00,29133," Sorry my friend,thats not a trick,thats,catching you in the act."
771842,Sinker,2013-03-05 00:55:00,8692,"Ya, I wouldn't call that trickery either. That's what they do. They do the same on the water with a spotting scope.  Best to play by the rules and answer questions honestly. They will ""trick"" you every time!  S."
771848,esoxansteel,2013-03-05 01:28:00,1307,"Did anyone get a picture of one of those CO's, i was under the impression that they were extinct in Ontario."
