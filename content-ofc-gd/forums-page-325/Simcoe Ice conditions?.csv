772012,wallacio,2013-03-06 00:19:00,475,"I was in the general area today (north shore, Oro) and walking is great...snow on the ice is firm, no slush so covering distance was easy."
772014,RickOnt,2013-03-06 00:23:00,669,"Jedi  Couple cracks to navigate, near shore, but not too bad.  Once you get out, the travelling is just about perfect!  Have a Great Day out There Rick"

772034,Burtess,2013-03-06 02:27:00,901,"  Yup, I've been out 3 times so far and nothing for me yet.  I will try one last time for the season this Saturday.  I have been going out of Oro 2, think I might try out of Oro 7 this time.  Good luck!!!  Burt"

Maybe I should bring some minnows with me next time.Good luck and catch a big one!"
