From my research I have heard it is a great place with great food. I will be going with a buddy and 3 kids (5 and 6 yrs olds).  I'm not too concerned with the accomodations but more so with the fishing.  I hear fishing can be tough at times but also fantastic.  We would mainly focus on walleye, bass and pike to keep the little guys busy.  Anyone with info on this area would be greatly appreciated. Cheers Pete  "

Last year was tough, but past season regulars had much more success the prior year. According to Steve, the time you are looking at is much better fishing.  As for the food, it is top notch, excellent service, and very comfy cabins.  We are returning not just for fishing obviously."
