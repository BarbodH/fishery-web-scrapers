771256,troutologist,2013-03-02 06:45:00,951,Fish slid out a bit deeper today. I had a couple of great guests out and we didn't catch huge numbers but got a few BIG fish. Rattle baits were king today.This was the biggest greenback I've seen this year.I even managed a nice one for my only fish today....can't answer the phone with me around.Been waiting all year for March on the ice...good way to kick things off.
