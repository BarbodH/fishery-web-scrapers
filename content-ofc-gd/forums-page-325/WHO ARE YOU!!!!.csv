768789,Headhunter,2013-02-19 15:00:00,5703,"Big Who fan here Peter, but ever since Entwistle passed away, I just cringe when I see them... that and Daultry's voice make it a no go for me. That said, I would love to hear Quad again... HH"

768861,Headhunter,2013-02-19 20:02:00,5703,"Pino is a great player, don't get me wrong, but as a bass player myself, The Ox was someone who inspired me. I was fortunate enough to have seen them 4 times, none unfortunately with Moon. Have a great time fellas, John ear plugs should be in order! Can you see the Real Me, can yah! HH"
768864,Headhunter,2013-02-19 20:07:00,5703,And here yah go...  HH
768871,capt bruce,2013-02-19 20:49:00,820,"Hey Joe ..

768954,Tim Mills,2013-02-20 01:29:00,476,Agree with HH a great band in they re time.  Saw them 25-30 yrs ago in Buffalo and at the EX (I think that was the show when openning act Joe Jackson's backup singer got hit in the face with a hotdog and he told the crowd to take a hike).  Both great shows and it was alot of fun camping out for tickets at lamport stadium (had to do that in the old days before the internet).
768962,shane,2013-02-20 01:49:00,652,I saw them way back in 1973 or '74 at the Gardens in Toronto. Keith Moon was wearing a Toronto Maple Leaf hocky sweater.
769060,Headhunter,2013-02-20 16:49:00,5703,"So boys, how was the show? Any pics that you would care to share? HH"
769067,John,2013-02-20 17:40:00,2956,Simply awesome........great great show one of the best I have seen....Amazing trib's to Moon and Entwistle..  
769068,John,2013-02-20 17:41:00,2956,Will try and get some vid up tonight..
769082,Headhunter,2013-02-20 18:32:00,5703,Thanks for the pic John and looking forward to the video! Kinda funny how a four piece band now needs multiple instrumentalists to pull off their material. HH
769091,John,2013-02-20 19:36:00,2956,"Keyboards and brass Joe, the brass was in tribute to John E...and as you know, Townshend's brother was added just before Entwistle's death and Pino of course just after..."
769101,BITEME,2013-02-20 19:57:00,1968,Quad was never really doable on stage when it came out it was very complex and needed much back tracks and machines on stage for the four what was witnessed last night is what pete envisioned it to be and yep that has to be the best who show i ever saw very fat very visual and the guys were just a plowing great great great show well worth every cent and it may turn out to be the last go around  an opus maybe  Peter
769106,Headhunter,2013-02-20 20:06:00,5703,I was really impressed with Zak Starkey on drums during the New York fund raiser on tv... the guy was an animal! HH
769107,Headhunter,2013-02-20 20:09:00,5703," Hey, maybe they'll do a ""fare well"" concert in Toronto to close out the tour?!!! LOL HH"
769116,John,2013-02-20 20:35:00,2956,There was talk about doing another TO concert..
771240,Tim Mills,2013-03-02 04:28:00,476, A friend who was at the show passed these pics along.  He said Daltry's voice is not what it used to be but Townsend was as good as ever.                 
771276,davey buoy,2013-03-02 12:13:00,5505,"Good clear photos,would of loved to see them again."
771467,turtle,2013-03-03 15:16:00,274,"I saw their ""final tour"" in 1980.  They headlined at the Ex, I think it was also J. Geils, Heart and Nash the Slash.  Kenny Jones was the drummer at that time."
