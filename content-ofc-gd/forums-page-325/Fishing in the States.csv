772124,Dan668,2013-03-06 16:40:00,1120,Thanks for the responses. Tough decision. A friend who is tagging along has a make a stop in virginia. So we may situate ourselves closer to that area.
772142,OhioFisherman,2013-03-06 18:37:00,6623,"http://www.dgif.virginia.gov/fishing/waterbodies/index.asp?type=1  If that helps any, Joe and Art would be the guys to ask about all things Virginia. Only there once myself and fished a water supply reservoir near Newport News, tackles shops in the area had 10 - 12 pound bass on the walls that had been caught there.  I had borrowed tackle, and an electric motor as the water supply lakes I checked out were all electric only. No luck for me except some strange eel that ate a golden shiner I was using for bait. I rented a boat at the lake, I was advised against walking the shoreline because of snakes. They have ones down there we don't see here."
771217,Dan668,2013-03-02 02:56:00,1120,"Is it worth taking a drive to the states to fish? Thinking sometime in April. Haven't researched into this yet, not sure whats in season. Myself and a few friends want to make a 3-4 day trip out of it. Was thinking 5-7hours. Will that get me into decent waters?  Thanks."
771226,BillM,2013-03-02 03:15:00,17367,What are you planning on fishing for?
771227,reelinrolly,2013-03-02 03:15:00,281,What do you wanna fish for??
771228,Joeytier,2013-03-02 03:15:00,3990,"Can't help with US waters, but 5-7 hours north will get you into some potentially good late-ice or early ice-out trout fishing"
771232,Dan668,2013-03-02 03:30:00,1120,"Not sure, I guess what ever is in season. Unless it's jigging for trout on the ice. I couldn't catch one if my life depended on it."
771255,OhioFisherman,2013-03-02 06:32:00,6623,"Just thinking that a lot of the border states have also gone to closed seasons for some species, you will need to check your area`s regulations carefully? They can vary from state to state and even with the body of water you intend to fish in some states.  Presque Isle Bay in Erie PA has some good bass fishing, it may be catch and release only in April, they get an occassional pike there early and some decent crappie and other panfish. East out of the bay opens up smallie waters.  Chautaqua lake in New York has some good bass fishing, smallies and largemouth,also a crappie run, muskies, walleye.  The season thing will limit you."
771270,Dan668,2013-03-02 10:30:00,1120,Thanks for the insight. Just realized that looking up a few of the closer States. What ever well be fishing for will always be catch and release.
771538,moparhawk,2013-03-04 00:07:00,146,In April if you can make it as far south as Missouri then fish Tablerock Lake. Excellent fishing for big bass.
771539,BillM,2013-03-04 00:13:00,17367,"If you're steelheading, then absolutely..  But for anything else I think you'd be better off fishing up here unless you wanna make a long haul to some of the southern states for bass."
771540,bare foot wader,2013-03-04 00:32:00,1354,ever considered going for those giant blue cats or flat heads? I think 7 hrs would get you in their range
771546,Christopheraaron,2013-03-04 01:02:00,3525,What about those silver carp? They would be a blast on the fly or light gear
771548,BillM,2013-03-04 01:15:00,17367," You mean the ones that feed on plankton?  Might have an issue hooking up with those, lol."
771550,bare foot wader,2013-03-04 01:20:00,1354," only tackle i'd be tossing at a silver carp is an arrow at about 300 fps, that looks fun lol"
771563,Whopper,2013-03-04 01:54:00,2174,Lake Erie western basin for walleyes if you have the boat for it. April the jig bite will be in full swing in the reef complex.
771570,Christopheraaron,2013-03-04 02:13:00,3525,"LOL, forgot. But I bet you $100 I could get 10 to hit the fly"
771673,Chance,2013-03-04 14:56:00,420,Just make sure all your safety equipment is in line with US coast guard rules and regs.
771692,doubleheader,2013-03-04 15:39:00,497,"One option for you is Pymatuning lake. Walleye are open year round and the ice comes off Mid- march. Fishing is very good, and some large fish can be had. It is probably not quite 3 hours south of Buffalo, NY. The crappy fishing is also really good. The only drawback is that despite being a large body of water there is a 20 HP limit. You can, however, have a bigger motor hanging off the back as long as it's not in use. This isn't too big an issue as good fishing is closeby. I would launch in Espyville. As the lake borrders both PA and Ohio you can fish any part of the lake using only the license from the state from which you plan to launch."
771712,craigdritchie,2013-03-04 16:49:00,1586,"If you want to drive a little further (9 hours from the GTA) you can fish northern Kentucky for muskies, stripers, walleye and bass. By April striper fishing will be at its best - fish average 8 to 15 pounds and at that time of year, they eat topwaters like crazy. Largemouth and smallmouth will be pre-spawn or spawning, so it's easy (and totally legal) C&R sight fishing in shallow water. Walleye will be immediately post-spawn, so skinny, hungry fish. They're big, but it's a planer board trolling bite, so pretty boring fishing (sort of like Erie). Muskie fishing peaks in April - lots of big muskie, which will all be in shallow reefs and points. Cast big inline spinners and you'll have a blast.  It's a cheap trip and a lot of fun.  Feel free to PM is you want specifics."
771739,mike rousseau,2013-03-04 19:27:00,4661,Some really good carp fishing to be had here in Ontario in April.... Hamilton harbor is probably close enough to you and lots of nice people to show you how to catch em....
771748,OhioFisherman,2013-03-04 19:57:00,6623," I spent a number of years docked in a marina in that area that also was home to some charter captains, their results could be impressive, some big eyes."
771774,aplumma,2013-03-04 21:56:00,6896,"Virginia and Pennsylvania are about 8 hours from the peace bridge. The Susqahanna and the Potomac river are good for Bass, Catfish both Flatties and Blues are available. You are also in line to see our nations capitol with some really great museums too.   Art"
771777,hirk,2013-03-04 22:09:00,571,"like art suggested, kerr resevoir in virginia or craigs suggestion kentucky lake"
771879,DReihl9896,2013-03-05 04:08:00,1,"There are definitely some good fisheries in the states, including right here in Michigan, but it'd be tough to beat what you can enjoy in Ontario."
771990,rmarentette,2013-03-05 22:17:00,124,"If you want the best of both worlds, you can get a Michigan fishing lisence and fish the Detroit River for fantastic walleye fishing in April. Just make sure you know the custom rules."
772005,OhioFisherman,2013-03-05 23:32:00,6623,"Kentucky lake, Dale Hollow, are a solid 8 hour drive from here, so add another 6 hours or so driving time from you and you have a whole day or more tied up just driving?  Our bass club used to meet in February to pick our tournament sites, a lot of the younger guys seemed to really suffer from cabin fever badly. You want to drive 3 - 3 1/2 hours for a one day tournament? The first of the year? Dudes! them hogs will be there in July and August when most of us have vacation time to spend a week there and have a two day tournament and some fun, with out a rushed feeling."
