763011,chris.brock,2013-01-27 22:51:00,4053,"Saturday afternoon, Steve and me hit a back lake for some stocked lakers. Here's Steve's sled, Tundra 300 LT, it's a great bushwacking sled too.    We rode down the side of the road, onto a lake, down the lake, then across a trail to our destination lake.  I think this pic will be familiar to a few people. An old heavy duty truck that can be run along the portage in hunting season. I don't know if it still runs.    At our destination, Steve punches a few holes, he brought his ATV today    Nice, quiet spot to spend the afternoon.    A little too quiet, no bites at all    Saturday night moon    Sunday morn. sunrise    Put my hut out on Gull, Sunday morn    the red-neck woodstove worked good, it can turn the hut into a sauna    Winston waiting for a fish to come out of the hole    Another great weekend at the cottage"
763022,solopaddler,2013-01-27 23:51:00,8605,Fun weekend Chris! Your stove looks like the Red Green deluxe model.
763026,Joeytier,2013-01-28 00:14:00,3990,"hah!  Love sled, love the scenery but most of all love the woodstove.  Looks like a great weekend."
763062,chris.brock,2013-01-28 02:34:00,4053," totally, Red Green never mentioned that duct tape burns when used on a stove pipe though, damn!   these stoves are pretty popular with cheap buggers like me, luckily the building inspector in Haliburton doesn't look at ice huts"
763170,SirCranksalot,2013-01-28 16:06:00,3291,"When you said 'launching' I assumed it had become airborne in a wind storm!  Tell me that that stove is not being held up by the blue rope we see in the foreground! Surely it would melt if it's, in fact, rope! I've redgreened a few things myself so I have to admire your handiwork!"
763175,chris.brock,2013-01-28 16:24:00,4053, it looks like blue rope but it's actually steel cable  Red Green would have been impressed for sure

763527,johnnyb,2013-01-29 20:54:00,3413,"Nice work, Chris!  I'm thinking we should hook up on Gull  in the summer"
763687,chris.brock,2013-01-30 07:48:00,4053," for sure, sounds like a plan  I still owe you a back lake trip too"
763695,ckrb2007,2013-01-30 11:11:00,449,"I made a stove exactly like that about 10yr ago for my hut. lol Worked great. I used those ""java"" logs that you buy in the grocery store.  Oh, great report and pics too!"
763710,SirCranksalot,2013-01-30 13:36:00,3291," Oh well, I guess it meets 'code' then!!"
763714,moxie,2013-01-30 13:51:00,1566,Looks like you had a nice wknd.
763731,johnnyb,2013-01-30 14:38:00,3413," I just saw that I typo'd that BIG TIME.  What I originally typed was ""we should hook up on Gull this winter, since we never seem to connect in the summer"".  Either way though....I'll drop you a line....soon I hope"
771292,mirogak,2013-03-02 14:24:00,387,That stove cracked me up ...
771293,woodenboater,2013-03-02 14:51:00,2277,that ghetto stove =    !!
771295,Nipfisher,2013-03-02 14:59:00,2449,No door or screen on that stove? What if the wood pops and sparks (embers) fly out?
771582,chris.brock,2013-03-04 02:41:00,4053," I spent 8 hours beside that stove on Saturday  When a spark pops out, and flies into your eye, then that's a bummer"
771689,cityfisher,2013-03-04 15:31:00,959,I also spent lots of time on the ice in hali last weekend!! Most of the time out of the hut but were fishing walleye and need to see the tipups... I just got my Sled tuned all up and now it feels like almost time to close it up for the season !!
