I also made up a bunch of trout spoons for the North channel too.  I had a problem with transporting spoons before this. I looked at a spoon box that was 14"" x 9"" x 3"". it holds 33 spoons using polypropylene foam and it costs about $16. There is a large one 17.5"" x 16 x  5"" for about $28 and it holds 66 spoons. Both are to big for my tackle bags. I use  the 3600 size boxes for almost all my storage. So I came up with my own version. I bout a couple of 4 pack 3600 sized clear boxes at CTC for 17.99 per four. That's about $5 a box(taxes inc). Found some packing foam that my nephew was throwing away from some appliance he bought.    Cut this stuff up using a filleting knife. and shaped them to fit. The front rows have 4 slits and can hold 4 spoons or 8 3"" or smaller spoons when double stacked. The back 2 rows hold 5 spoons(5 slits) or 10 double stacked.    That works out to 28 spoons for a 2 row single stack or 56 double stack. For the triple rows(21/8"" spoons) that 42 single stack or 84 double stack.  My spoon bag hold 6 of these boxes plus terminal gear.   I can safely transport over 300 spoons this way. Tangles are minimized and the spoons stay scratch free.  muddler   "
