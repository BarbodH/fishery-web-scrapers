315220,ILUVSTEEL,2009-03-09 18:31:00,1,"Hi There,  I have fished the north and south ends of this awesome lake for 8 yrs.  There is a lot of water to cover.  It is like any other lake, if you find them you will hit 50-100 fish between 2-3 people.  If you can't find them you might as well troll for lakers in 20 ft.  Although jigger08 comments are not entirely accurate there is some truth to it.  It all depends on ice out.  I have been there on opening week when ice out was early and we HAMMERED those beauties.  I have also had SLOW opening weeks, that's when we went for lakers.  I recommend Kipawa Pavillion Lodge run by Wayne Moreau.  The resort location and the service is awesome!!!  PS. The Pickerel are BLUE and they taste great!  Good Luck"
315226,solopaddler,2009-03-09 18:50:00,8605,I was checked once on my lake in N/W Quebec by an OPP boat with an officer driving and a C.O. in the bow. I happened to have a couple of cans of Bud in a small cooler at my feet when they approached out of nowhere. Have to admit I was a bit concerned until they pulled alongside to check licenses and the waves of rye emanating from the C.O. almost knocked me over. I actually had to turn my head away from him it was so bad LOL!
315242,irishfield,2009-03-09 19:16:00,26272,That was just Northern Cologne Mike! I caught a wiff of that up Matchewan way on August 3rd.. but the wearer wasn't home...
772068,Sharkbait22,2013-03-06 13:15:00,297,Does anyone know what the ice conditions are like for Kipawa Lake and area?  Supposed to up there this weekend. We'll be snowmobiling in. Thanks.
772083,adempsey,2013-03-06 14:28:00,1498,I also suggest asking some of the locals here.
772100,Lip-ripper,2013-03-06 15:39:00,228,"I own a cottage near Kipawa and have been out there almost every weekend for the last couple years.  Kipawa is a beautiful lake. Make sure you know where you are going as it's easy to get lost. Lots of good opportunities for fishing but as mentioned earlier, it can be tough until the water settles down after the spring thaw.  As for minnows, make sure they are dead and also that they are bought in Quebec. If you import minnows from Ontario, big fines.  Now, the drinking thing--here's my experience.  My neighbor was with 2 guys and was stopped by a CO with a QPP in the boat as well.  They checked the licenses and saw the empties laying on the bottom of the boat. Some bottles, some cans. All they asked to see were the bottle caps and they counted them to make sure they matched the number of bottles in the boat.  If they hadn't shown them, it would have been a fine for littering.  QPP talked to the driver to see if he was impaired and he wasn't, just had a few.  ""good luck boys!"" End of the story. To be honest, I enjoy bringing a couple when I go out for an evening troll after supper.  It's a relaxing feeling to be able to enjoy a few pops in the boat without the fear of a prick OPP taking your drivers license over it."
313154,tipupesox,2009-03-04 18:50:00,167,"Has anyone ever had the pleasure of fishing this body of water?  We are looking at booking a trip for late Spring/early Summer and wondering if this lake has decent fishing.  Looking at targeting pike and walleyes.  Any lodging recommendations?  Thank you, Tom"
313160,Bitsmith2k,2009-03-04 19:05:00,396," Hey Tom,  we're headin up to Alwaki Lodge in July..  i've been checking out http://www.kipawa.net seems to be lots of area specific info there...  mike"
313238,holdfast,2009-03-04 22:31:00,1813,"Is that around the Lac Beauchene area.  If so , Ive always had my eyes on a map looking at that lake to Tackle.  Love to hear how you guys make out."
313314,Tomcat,2009-03-05 01:11:00,395,"For the last 9 years, I've taken a one week fishing trip to Lake Kipawa. The lake is about 50 miles long and full of structure. Bathymetric maps are available for the complete system. Walleye and lake trout are probably the main prey for the majority of fishermen fishing those waters. Regardless, northern pike can easily be found if that's what you're after. I believe there are 24 or 25 outfitters on the lake. Some are drive-in while the majority are boat-in. With respect to accommodations, there's lots of choice. American Plans and Housekeeping Plans are available."
313318,Bitsmith2k,2009-03-05 01:18:00,396, i think Lac Beauchene is just south of lake kipawa...   nice tomcat.. i think we're going to be targetting mainly walleyes and pike... any idea on what patterns typically produce? how bout live bait? can you use live shinners up there?  mike
313334,Reelpro,2009-03-05 01:48:00,73,"Hey Tom  Late spring early summer will have the Walleye moving to their summer haunts and the big spawning schools will be breaking up.  Concentrate on shallow flats and water inflows in the morning and evening. Jigs tipped with worms and leeches work great. Lindy rigs w/ pink float beads.  Other than low light times, trolling is probably the best bet to find scattered fish. If you get on a good group. switch to the jigs again.  Trolling baits that work well there. Shallow stick baits, Bombers, Rapala. Divers, Hot'nTot - smallest size for 10 to 15 feet next size up for 15' to 20'. If it gets real calm/sunny next size up for 20 to 25'. Silver chrome/blk back and Gold Chrome/blak back work great.  For Pike, pretty much same areas, I usually have a Muskie rod just for them, with heavier line and good steel leader, for casting and trolling bigger baits. Any large Pike/Muskie bait works. the forage base there for them is primarily ""fall fish"" a large scaled very silver bait fish that grows to about a lb. most are 6 to 10 inches in length. The bigger Walleye prey on them too.  Lake trout, troll depths of 50 to 55 feet early and late.  GL MIKE "
313483,Spiel,2009-03-05 12:46:00,9065,"I used to make annual pilgramages through the 80""s in the first week of June. Walleye and laker fishing was great. Big eyes on shallow structure in the evenings and lakers all day using riggers.  You might find more up to date info here.  www.kipawa.net"
313498,tipupesox,2009-03-05 13:26:00,167,"Thanks everyone for the information.  We are just in the planning process so it is time to do some research.  I think I am still edging towards a fly-in on the Gouin but just hate the drive in on the logging road.  Thanks again, Tom"
313524,Tomcat,2009-03-05 14:46:00,395," Hi Mike  No live minnows allowed. I don't target pike so I have no info on them.  Lake Kipawa is a relatively clear water lake. We usually jig early mornings and evenings. I've had success with just a light wire hook and leech as well as with a white 1/8 ounce jig with a leech although there are times when the walleye prefer crawlers to leeches. During the day, I tend to back troll with bottom bouncers. Most success for me bottom bouncing has come using a Northland BaitFish-Image Spinner Harness (model Silver Shiner) with a leech or crawler - see http://www.northlandtackle.com/Category/main.taf?cat=188  Sometimes we have to revert to slip bobbering when the walleyes are suspended (e.g. last year during the last week of June, many walleyes were suspended at 7 feet in 13 feet of water). While many fishermen prefer opening week, the fish biologist for the area advised fishing Kipawa after 15 June. Consequently, I've fished Kipawa 4 times during the last week of June and 5  times during early September. I prefer September because of cooler temperatures and no bugs. I've always stayed at 3 Seasons Camp - see http://www.3seasoncamp.com/  You shouldn't have any difficulty catching enough walleye to get your fill of eating walleye. There's a good lake trout fishery in Lake Kipawa as well. Minimum length limit is 20 inches. I usually run a downrigger at 35 feet in at least 60 feet of water. Have a great trip."
313532,addy79,2009-03-05 15:03:00,573,"Eastview Lake Lodge...  Greatcottage resort, a fello by the na,e of George runs the show up there. Picks you up at teh government docks and its about a 5 km ride to his island.  Laker fishing there is phenomanal! Walleye fishing was ok, but apparently it has declined.  there are MASSIVE pike in Kipawa!! George has pics of 50""'s he pulled out in the eighties.  We had great luck with pike on some of the small lakes that border kipawa, short portage away, where we could catch one on almost every cast!  we used leadcore line for lakers and caught em all day long! everyday!  walleye successes from bouncing twistertails on 1/4oz jigs over structure/current  the pike will hit just about anything that catched their attention, so go big or go home.  i highly reccomend Eastvilake lodge.  btw...   the conservation officers on the lake are militant, so fork out the extra bucks for the QC license and mind the size restrictions on the lakers and have fun!!"
313541,Bitsmith2k,2009-03-05 15:16:00,396, awesome info.. july wont get here quick enough for me..  is there truth to being able to drink on the boat out there?
313543,addy79,2009-03-05 15:20:00,573,"brother thats the best part about kipawa!!!  CO's buzz you overhead in bush planes, minutes later you get a drive by from a conservation officer, all he is interested in is the size of the lakers on your chain, not the 24 in the middle of the tinny!  awesome place!"
313548,Roy,2009-03-05 15:31:00,13728, No truth to that at all. It's a Federal jurisdiction and it's a no no wherever you are in Canada.
313555,addy79,2009-03-05 15:45:00,573,"Roy, Im just tellin em what i experienced...  we were allowed to drink on the boat, corrections officers stopped us more than once and NEVER mentioned a thing about the beer.  only wanted to measure our catches and check our lisences.   i was lead to believe that drinkin on the boat was allowed in QC, and the fact that it wasnt acknowledged by the officer only further proved it.  maybe the three that witnessed it were indifferent, regardless, we werent fined, had a BLAST"
313559,Bitsmith2k,2009-03-05 15:52:00,396," damn it roy, ruining my dreams!..  i'll err on the side of caution and leave the booze at camp.."
313566,Roy,2009-03-05 16:06:00,13728," Oh, sorry, I guess you must be right then."
313567,addy79,2009-03-05 16:12:00,573,"listen im not saying im right or wrong either way, just sharing an experience. why the attitude????!! thats no way to encourage users  i thought thats what this board was about???!  seems alot more like a queen fest as of late, mabe just the time of year...  i digress"
313572,Roy,2009-03-05 16:43:00,13728,"What would you like me to tell you Addy? You're right? Maybe encourage you a little? I'm just telling you that it's illegal, that's all. But hey, if all else fails, you can always read the regs. Whatever you do....have a great time on the water."
313577,Tomcat,2009-03-05 17:03:00,395,"Boating while impaired is an offence under the Criminal Code of Canada.  In Ontario, Sec. 32 (3) of the Ontario Liquor Licence Act goes even further and states ""No person shall operate or have care or control of a boat that is underway while there is contained in the boat any liquor, except under the authority of a licence or permit.""  IMHO, the Ontario law is draconian.  Since I fish mostly in Quebec, I sent the Quebec Government an inquiry about the Quebec laws regarding consumption and/or transportation of  alcoholic beverages while fishing in a boat. Here is the response I received:  ""In Quebec, there is no law regarding the consumption of alcoholic beverages in boats except the Canadian Criminal code.""  While we have been stopped and checked many times by Quebec conservation officers over the last 30 years, we have never been asked about the empty beer cans in the bottom of our boat. We have never ever been impaired while on the water."
313580,Spiel,2009-03-05 17:14:00,9065,"   I can also attest to being checked by CO's on a few occasions and they never said anything about beer in the boat. They do however carry radios and they can contact the QPP if they believe you to be impaired and I can tell you this, the QPP don't play games!"
313600,addy79,2009-03-05 18:11:00,573,"fair enough... perhaps what i was told was that a CO can not charge you; that they turn a blind eye... HOWEVER, if a police officer was to witness this or be contacted, i would be liable under canadian law, good to know.  for the record, im not puttin around kipawa torqued in my 9.9, just a few travellers  in light of this info, i will proceed with a little more caution.  thanks for the research and information all"
313748,Billy Bob,2009-03-06 00:11:00,5865,"I have always had beer in my boat on Ontario waters. Never had a problem YET !  What about house boats. I have rented house boats on the Kawarthans twice and had beer, rum, wine and vodka aboard. No one ever said we couldn't ? ? ?"
313774,irishfield,2009-03-06 01:02:00,26272," Well sooner or later...  CO's now have the ability to lay liquor charges in Ontario. You cannot consume alcohol anywhere in Ontario but on your own property or rented property/campsite etc. The only time you can have alcohol in your boat in Ontario is when taking it from one residence (or the store) to your campsite/cottage/house etc.  Houseboats or boats with a FULL head and sleeping facilities... MUST be anchored before anything gets poured. Nobody on board can, legally, drink while underway.  Unfortunately not like the USA where you can sit on the Capital Buildings steps and drink a beer... not that I'd ever do that...  ... now back to Lake Kipawa info... I keep thinking of flying over there one day from my place in Temagami."
314069,tipupesox,2009-03-06 18:08:00,167,"Looks like the discussion went a little off topic.  Thanks again gentlemen for the information on the area.  Good fishing, Tom"
