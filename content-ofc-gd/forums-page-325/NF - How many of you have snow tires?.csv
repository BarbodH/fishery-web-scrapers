They are the cats meow on days like today!  You probably pay more for two sets of all seasons than you do for a set of all seasons, and a set of winters, plus you get the safety factor in the winter.

I live in an appartment building and seen people have trouple pullin out of their spot with all seasons. I haven't had those issues at all. Much better grippig and stopping power and thats with cheap snow tires from Walmart.
770773,Tdel,2013-02-28 03:26:00,393,"I use to think that all season tires were great for the winter until I got a full set of winter tires on my car. There is no comparison, the winter tires have more control and traction. As T.J. said ""I dont think I could forgive myself"". They are worth the money and you can tell who has them and who doesn't when the weather gets dirty.  Don't give me that ""false sence of security"" business. I am just as focused on my driving when using snows as I was using all season tires. The difference is that I am more in control with the snow tires and don't end up spinning tires at a stop sign, slight hill, behind someone who is stuck in front of me.  Most of the time car in front of me that is swaying back and forth on flat roads trying to find traction have all season tires...  Tom."

Dear wife insisted on getting winter radials when she purchased her newer Altima in 08, I said they are just trying to sell you tires. Was I wrong, again. What a difference, newer all season radials are much harder than the first generation tires and are useless in the snow. I have all season radials on my 011 Sierra, didn't have a chance to test them last year, no snow, I can certainly go through deeper snow than her Altima, however hers handles much better when roads are slick. Yes, the real key is to slow down. We are rural now and these roads are in the same shape 5 minutes after the plows go by on Lake Erie lakeshore. There have been times this year I would only go out in a backhoe."

It would not be a wise decision to live in this area and not have dedicated snow tires on your daily driver ! Just last night I saw 2 ditched cars , 3 cars spinning and going no where , a transport completly stopped and one guy that was just making it up on the Hockley Valley airport road hill , you know what the slidding/ditched cars had in common they all had shiny aluminum rims which probably means they had all seasons on while the guy that was making it had his old beater winter rims and was able to get around these guys and make it up the hill (for sure he had snows on) It just takes you to go in the ditch once and hit something and that cost would have paid for your snows , no brainer to me ."
770864,aero_ball,2013-02-28 17:27:00,19,"I've had winter tires installed on various mid size sedans (all front wheel drive, most have traction or stability control features) for the past 15 years (except for 2 winters which I had new all-season tires on when the cars were bought new). Most of the driving was done within the Greater Toronto Area but I have lived in other cities in the south eastern Ontario region. I have made road trips to Quebec and up north (within 6 hours drive 1-way) from time to time as well. On average I drive about 2000 km per month.  From my personal experience the winter tires (price ranging from $80 - $200 per tire) do make a hugh difference when driving in the snow or on ice. It has given me the traction and stability that blows all season tires I have driven on (price ranging from $100 - $250 per tire). One of the cases was 5 years ago, after the all season tire on my then one-year-old car got me stucked multiple times in moderate snow, I put on an 8-years-old set of winter from my old car, and I was good for the rest of that winter and the next 3 to come. In mild conditions (and hopefully on level, nicely plowed ground) driving slowly with all season tires might work, which could be the case 99% of the time in the winter (just me daydreaming...) but it's when the weather is less than perfect that counts. Being able to drive the car with reasonable speed that the traffic allows, and stopping at a red light or before hitting the car (or pedestrian) ahead are what matters to me. Aside from the price there is also the hassle of moving / storing / installing them but from the many personal experiences I find it well worth the money and efforts.  Even though I can choose to stay home should there be a snowstorm, not everyone has the same option, and not all storms happen overnight. Winter throws things at you when you least expected it and before long one might get stuck after all the snow fall in the middle of the day. Now you're out and it's the difference between making it home or not. Or for some, whether you can go pick up your kids from school and get them home safely. Even if the major road were plowed the side streets might not. And at times one might need to get out of an unplowed parking lot to get onto plowed roads.  Like another member mentioned I could not forgive myself if something happens to my wife and kid because winter tires were not installed. Be it an accident or if they got stranded somewhere and had to wait hours in the snow for a tow, it is just unacceptable for me. As some other members mentioned it prolongs the life of the set of all season tires too and I will be happy to continue using winter tires. It might be different for all-wheel-drive sedans (or better yet, all-wheel-drive SUV's) but I don't have the experience to comment on that.  Afterall, I belive that a worm on a hook and sinker under 8 lb mono doesn't work all year for all species of fish. Just my 2-cents."

Sure it's $1000 with rims, but they should last me 3-4 years at least.   I also started travelling further north for ice fishing and had to drive through some relatively deep snow many times.  That alone was worth getting them.  This graph might help (although, who knows how accurate it truly is...maybe it's just to help sell more tires): "

I've never had an issue with my All seasons and have been a safe and confident winter driver my whole life. Most of my driving is here in Kitchener, but I do travel to Bruce and Wellington counties often where the snow is a bit more frequent and I have not had any issues with control that I couldn't handle safely. I simply adjust to the limitations of my vehicle and drive accordingly the way I was taught and thats got me this far. I'm 100% sure Winter tires make a difference but I just can't rationalize spending the cash on a second set of tires When I honestly have no concerns about my all season tires. Maybe someday I'll have a chance to test drive some winter tires and they'll blow my mind or somthing but for now I'm quite content with my all seasons.  On a side note I find rear wheel drive vs. front wheel vs. All weel vs 4 wheel drive makes a hell of a difference though..."

We had a little disagreement about whether or not snow tires were needed. I thought everyone just used all season tires now. Is it common in Ontario for people to have 2 sets of tires per car?
770560,DRIFTER_016,2013-02-27 17:05:00,10439,When I lived in Grand Valley I had them and I have them here. I didn't have them when I lived in Mississauga just because the roads are cleared and salted so well. There were very few days you actually needed them there. London does get a lot more snow than the GTA so I would expect the need for snow tires is higher.

Winter tires are a softer rubber compound and are VERY useful.  My little honda blasts through just about anything with a good set of winter tires, it certainly does not without them.  Depends on the car - if you drive something with AWD/4X4 then a good set of all seasons will probably work just fine.  Remember, 4x4 doesn't help you stop..."
