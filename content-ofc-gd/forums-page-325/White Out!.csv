Hungry for one of those illusive beasts we decided to give it one last chance, one more road trip, one more epic adventure.  Easier said than done when there is trout are involved, our trip fell right on a full moon with a massive snow storm moving in. Take off at 3 am, though the conditions on the road were rather harsh, the drive up to Boshkung lake was gorgeous. The Haliburton highlands are a real treat for the eyes all year long but in particular when everything is covered in thick heavy snow.      We arrived at the lake around 6.30, geared up and fishing by 7, the spirits where high, fuelled by fantasies and the stories that surround this beautiful lake. The bite was shy all morning, marks on the flasher would come and go, chase a little but never really commit.  The joys of fishing after a bright full moon...but simply just being out and about with the boys, not being at work, fishing and having a blast is what its all about anyway.  Mid day we decided to fish with a little more finesse, minnows on a drop shot gently rocking off the bottom, it didn't take long for the first hit.  A nice little laker finally couldn't resist our offerings. As soon as her tail popped through the hole the tiny single hook came undone, trout on the loose, swimming in the 2'' of water under the hut. It kept the crew excited as we took turns reaching under the shack trying to grab a hold of the little bugger.    The afternoon passed by while we were chasing bars, cracking brews and jokes. 20 minutes until last day light and we picked up one more grey. Sometimes its the little things, we worked hard all day and got rewarded.    Exhausted but happy we all crashed at our room, a few hours of sleep and time for round two. The storm had settled over night and we decided to hit a lake more familiar to us. After a day with a one line limit we couldnt wait to deploy our tip ups. Set up over 10  30â€² feet, loaded with big dead bait on quick strikes it didnt take long for the first flag up.      About 10 am we decided to move into the bay to kill the rest of the day with some big perch. Leaving the heavier rods behind and switched to light gear. The bite was hot at noon, the perch came up in good size and numbers. There is nothing more fun to us than lifting perch after perch out of the hole, jumping from spot to spot to keep enticing those fat little guys. Late season offers the best perch fishing as they start spawning and are feeding ferociously.      The afternoon flew by way to fast and it was soon time to pack up and leave. In a last minute attempt John decided to wander further out towards the mouth of the bay. Fishing in 30 feet he was still picking up perch when suddenly I look over to see this    Oh I got a big one. he shouts  An intense fight unraveled, the sweet sound of a screeching reel just wouldnt stop. The 2 lb test was under tremendous pressure, so many things could have gone wrong but Johns experience and patients let to victory. 9 agonizing minutes and several ridiculous runs later he iced this beautiful laker.  The illusive beast, finally, while jigging for perch     Lesson learned today, its never over until its over. Here is a little testimonial to the beast and Johns skills on ultra light gear.
