He was nice enough to show me a spot, on my home lake in Haliburton (Gull), where the ling should stack up during spawning. He said it's good near the end of the ice fishing season, during sunny, warm days, when you're almost pressing your luck being out on the late season ice.  Scott and Crossman says ling spawn mid winter.  Does anyone have any experience or info?"
771653,Rod Caster,2013-03-04 12:38:00,5784,"Im no expert, but I've caught ling in mid march in 30fow with eggs in their bellies, so I'd venture to guess they spawn a bit later in the seaons."
771663,bigugli,2013-03-04 13:34:00,6138,"I would think any time from now, depending on location and the kind of winter we've had this year."
771667,Fang,2013-03-04 14:08:00,1330,"Spawning begins end of March, beginning of April Temagami time so it would be pretty close to where you are"

771855,Sinker,2013-03-05 01:53:00,8692,"Yep, ling are one of the only fish that spawn under the ice. Mid march till ice out, they gather for the spawn. Best luck for me is always at dusk and into dark. A big minnow on a glow jighead is all you need.  S."
