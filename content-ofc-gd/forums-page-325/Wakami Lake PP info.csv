From what i have discovered the lake has good fishing for walleye,whitefish,and pike. If anyone could share some info about the area,it would be greatly appreciated. Thanks"

771846,TDunn,2013-03-05 01:18:00,680,One of my favorites too! Pounded the walleye at the river mouth and in the river one may long. The river is a descent ride from the campsites but well worth it in may. We bottom bounced when going upstream and used jigs while drifting down. Caught walleyes from shore at night too.  Just past the boat launch there is a little back bay that is loaded with weeds and pike.  TDunn
