772022,Burtess,2013-03-06 01:25:00,901," Lol.... see below...   The 0 degrees Celcius is the same as the Ice Cube and the Sub Zero from Crappy Tire isn't it?   Yes, now that I read it over, I can see why this is........   I slid a 1/2"" piece of CPVC I had lying around over it tight to the hub and to the corner pocket, looks like that will last temporarily.  I also bought a 72"" X 3/8"" fiberglass driveway marker that I will trim and glue it in when I am done for the season.  Found that fix online.   Burt"
