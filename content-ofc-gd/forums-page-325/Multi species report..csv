770419,pidge,2013-02-27 00:07:00,438,"Man thats a cool report, bonus seeing the Lynx or whatever that kitty was, thats pretty cool. I've never caught a Ling before, but thats some crazy looking fish right there. Thanks for sharing that one, looked like an awsome day."
770421,Roy,2013-02-27 00:13:00,13728,Congrats to you Simon. That is a LARGE ling! Seldom see them that big here. You lead a charmed life my friend.
770442,spincast,2013-02-27 00:59:00,3279,x2 - anywhere you can count on a limit out as a rule is stellar.
770450,danc,2013-02-27 01:41:00,4677,Nice job Simon. Ling must grow big up that way. I remember catching a few on Sturgeon (north of Ignace) with heads on them the size of 10 pin bowling balls!
770451,Nipfisher,2013-02-27 01:48:00,2449,When I first looked at your helmet on your sled I thought it was a kid on a 120cc. Nice outing. I guess I could do 2 lakes in one day but that seems like a lot of work.
770481,dhickey,2013-02-27 03:50:00,1038,Your realy starting to get on my nerves. Good for you Limey glad to see you had another good DAY
