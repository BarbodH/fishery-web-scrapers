I wish you all the best... if our paths meet in the city in the near future we need to do lunch with You, Jen, Leah and I.  As I'm sure you have over the last couple of years...... we have dealt with people that mean well in the grand scheme of things, but have no idea of the deep hurt that offering ""hear say"" cancer advise can do to patient and family. Why people type up crap and share it on the internet, like PF put up as a well meaning piece of advise, is beyond me... it's false propoganda.  http://www.snopes.com/medical/disease/cancerupdate.asp"

770008,nancur373,2013-02-25 03:14:00,1211,Sorry Wayne.  My apologies.  These back meds have me drowsy and cranky. I'll remove post.
770009,MJL,2013-02-25 03:37:00,2427," Mike, Hopefully I’ll be equipped with a new underwater housing shortly for this bad boy I picked up last month     No worries. Over the last 2+yrs, I’ve been given the opportunity to become a student of oncology. The doctors at Sunnybrook, Scarborough Grace, Mount Sinai & more have given me the probabilities & statistics and various recommendations but they’ve always given me the choice to make the final decisions on what route to take. As such, I’ve tried to learn as much as I can to prepare myself for the bumpy road ahead. I’m fortunate to have all of you in this community who care as much as you do and I will be forever grateful and appreciative for that  I’ll let you guys know how it goes  Cheers & all smiles  Mike"

770666,MJL,2013-02-28 00:15:00,2427,"Thanks a ton guys for your support. Forever grateful  The plan will be finalized on Friday after a number of doctors discuss my case. I’m currently booked for 3 rounds of chemo lasting a total of 9 weeks (1 round = 3wks). Treatment starts Monday. Unfortunately, there are a couple other spots where the cancer may also be so radiation was not the recommended method of treatment. My mom bought a tons of cases of Ensure/Boost drinks and stocked up on baking soda for mouthwash. I’m as ready for it as I will ever be.  Maybe 1 more trip onto the ice…  Thanks again guys  Mike"
770822,Old Ironmaker,2013-02-28 14:19:00,8243,"Mike, you sure do know how to catch them. And only a short time fishing. I have never had a Lake day like that and I bet I have spent a years salary more than you have over the years on tackle.  As far as you health, been there done that. What has worked for me is attitude. As well as everyone that I know that has beat it,  the common denominator is attitude.  I have a kid brother that was given a clean bill of health 5 years ago and is obsessed with the disease. Just ask him, if you have an extra hour in your life to waste. I have been cancer free for a year and will be tested every 6 months for the next few years. I run into old friends and co workers and they ask what's new? I tell them about the bass and perch we hammer and my golf game getting worse, they ask, "" oh, I was told you have cancer "". I reply "" oh, that?""  Attitude son, attitude, same as hauling in that 12 pounder on 2 lb. Test. Attitude, along with everyone's best wishes and prayers."
770834,The Urban Fisherman,2013-02-28 15:44:00,2050,"Mike we need a ""like"" button on OFC so I can put a ""like"" button beat down on all the great responses here.  Once again, we're in your corner brother and I'm looking forward to hitting the water with you when you're back to %100!"

769828,MJL,2013-02-24 03:40:00,2427,"Highs  I hit the ice late this season but it didn’t matter. The laker gods were extremely generous this season . A few years ago I never would’ve thought I’d ever see so much action on the ice. Last year I discovered the secret to catching more lakers…Buy more tackle…It’s clearly obvious that the more money you spend on tackle, the more fish you catch  Made my first trip onto the ice Jan 28 and got into some nice hogs   Face full of tentacles   The food chain   Matching the hatch   Healthy bend in the rod   Small clipper for dinner   One of the strongest lakers I’ve ever done battle with   Today I hit the ice for a bit for perhaps the last time this season. Fishing was tougher than the previous 5 trips for me but still managed a couple   Since I started ice fishing 4yrs ago, I kept a journal to record the details of each trip with the hopes of improving my success rate. Back in 2010, I managed to land 2 lakers in 12 trips on the ice (Skunking 10 times in a row). This year I managed to land 45 fish in 6 trips – By far my best season ever.  Lows  Unfortunately some good things must come to an end. As many of you know, a couple years ago I had some experience with cancer. This past week, I was informed that I will probably have to undergo cancer treatment again. After almost 2yrs, my CT scans and blood tests from last week revealed that my cancer has returned . Monday I go to the hospital to see my doctor and go over the test results in greater detail and see if I will need radiation or chemo. Tuesday I go to see the radiologist to learn what is involved with radiation therapy. For those that have gone through radiation therapy, any experiences you can share or tips you found helpful for getting through it? I’d greatly appreciate any info you could provide.  Many Thanks  Mike  "
769829,ccmtcanada,2013-02-24 03:59:00,7971,Very nice Mike!! I haven't wet a line since November!!  Ice fishing has never been kind to me.  So sorry to hear that you have to go through treatment again.  You are young and strong...I'm sure you will bat it down again!

769847,Handlebarz,2013-02-24 14:35:00,3790,Awesome ice season for you for sure Mike thanks for sharing it with us.  As for the cancer treatments I have never been through it myself but fought along with my brother father and some very close friends. The secret I have seen is bieng positive and having a end goal in mind and keeping it the main target.  People I see that have lost there battle fast usually dont have loved ones or have a reason to keep fighting so they go fast. From reading your threads over the years I can see you have a reason so keep the fight strong on your down days think of what you want to be here for.  Know that the OFC family will be here even if each member does not post on the threads I bet they are thinking of you and our other members going through the same battle.  Best of luck in the coming months.
769850,mr blizzard,2013-02-24 14:57:00,1589,"Thanks for sharing those pictures with us, you have had an amazing season, AND you will have amazing results in maintaining your health,  Just like you said the MORE  tackle you buy the more fish you catch.  Well you have a bushel full  of prayers coming to you from Yellowknife, looking forward to pictures from you on the OFC of next years catch.  Blizz"
769853,nancur373,2013-02-24 15:06:00,1211,"Just came across this. It's quite a read but interesting just the same.    LATEST CANCER INFORMATIONfrom Johns HopkinsAFTER YEARS OF TELLING PEOPLE CHEMOTHERAPY IS THE ONLY WAY TO TRY AND ELIMINATE CANCER, JOHNS HOPKINS IS FINALLY STARTING TO TELL YOU THERE IS AN ALTERNATIVE WAY …1. Every person has cancer cells in the body. These cancer cells do not show up in the standard tests until they have multiplied to a few billion. When doctors tell cancer patients that there are no more cancer cells in their bodies after treatment, it just means the tests are unable to detect the cancer cells because they have not reached the detectable size.2. Cancer cells occur between 6 to more than 10 times in a person's lifetime.3. When the person's immune system is strong the cancer cells will be destroyed and prevented from multiplying and forming tumors.4. When a person has cancer it indicates the person has multiple nutritional deficiencies. These could be due to genetic, environmental, food and lifestyle factors.5. To overcome the multiple nutritional deficiencies, changing diet and including supplements will strengthen the immune system.6. Chemotherapy involves poisoning the rapidly-growing cancer cells and also destroys rapidly-growing healthy cells in the bone marrow, gastro-intestinal tract etc, and can cause organ damage, like liver, kidneys, heart, lungs etc.7. Radiation while destroying cancer cells also burns, scars and damages healthy cells, tissues and organs.8. Initial treatment with chemotherapy and radiation will often reduce tumor size. However prolonged use of chemotherapy and radiation do not result in more tumor destruction.9. When the body has too much toxic burden from chemotherapy and radiation the immune system is either compromised or destroyed, hence the person can succumb to various kinds of infections and complications.10. Chemotherapy and radiation can cause cancer cells to mutate and become resistant and difficult to destroy. Surgery can also cause cancer cells to spread to other sites.11. An effective way to battle cancer is to STARVE the cancer cells by not feeding it with foods it needs to multiple.What cancer cells feed on:a. Sugar is a cancer-feeder. By cutting off sugar it cuts off one important food supply to the cancer cells. Note: Sugar substitutes like NutraSweet, Equal, Spoonful, etc are made with Aspartame and it is harmful. A better natural substitute would be Manuka honey or molasses but only in very small amounts. Table salt has a chemical added to make it white in colour. Better alternative is Bragg's aminos or sea salt.b. Milk causes the body to produce mucus, especially in the gastro-intestinal tract. Cancer feeds on mucus. By cutting off milk and substituting with unsweetened soy milk, cancer cells will starved.c. Cancer cells thrive in an acid environment. A meat-based diet is acidic and it is best to eat fish, and a little chicken rather than beef or pork. Meat also contains livestock antibiotics, growth hormones and parasites, which are all harmful, especially to people with cancer.d. A diet made of 80% fresh vegetables and juice, whole grains, seeds, nuts and a little fruits help put the body into an alkaline environment. About 20% can be from cooked food including beans. Fresh vegetable juices provide live enzymes that are easily absorbed and reach down to cellular levels within 15 minutes t o nourish and enhance growth of healthy cells.To obtain live enzymes for building healthy cells try and drink fresh vegetable juice (most vegetables including bean sprouts) and eat some raw vegetables 2 or 3 times a day. Enzymes are destroyed at temperatures of 104 degrees F (40 degrees C).e. Avoid coffee, tea, and chocolate, which have high caffeine. Green tea is a better alternative and has cancer-fighting properties. Water--best to drink purified water, or filtered, to avoid known toxins and heavy metals in tap water. Distilled water is acidic, avoid it.12. Meat protein is difficult to digest and requires a lot of digestive enzymes. Undigested meat remaining in the intestines will become putrified and leads to more toxic buildup.13. Cancer cell walls have a tough protein covering. By refraining from or eating less meat it frees more enzymes to attack the protein walls of cancer cells and allows the body's killer cells to destroy the cancer cells.14. Some supplements build up the immune system (IP6, Flor-ssence, Essiac, anti-oxidants, vitamins, minerals, EFAs etc.) to enable the body's own killer cells to destroy cancer cells. Other supplements like vitamin E are known to cause apoptosis, or programmed cell death, the body's normal method of disposing of damaged, unwanted, or unneeded cells.15. Cancer is a disease of the mind, body, and spirit. A proactive and positive spirit will help the cancer warrior be a survivor.Anger, unforgiving and bitterness put the body into a stressful and acidic environment. Learn to have a loving and forgiving spirit. Learn to relax and enjoy life.16. Cancer cells cannot thrive in an oxygenated environment. Exercising daily, and deep breathing help to get more oxygen down to the cellular level. Oxygen therapy is another means employed to destroy cancer cells."
