771449,Handlebarz,2013-03-03 12:53:00,3790,Tj I already talked to them about it but they will have nothing to do with it. Something about his wife is to nice to kick her out so they are in LOL  I will also be having a give away that will be posted here some time soon only catch is you have to come to the odyssey to win.  One of the best parts of this show is the family pricing IMO that just kicks ass as where else can you go with your family for $15-$20 it sure makes it a easier sell to you spouse when its just $20 to have a great day and its close enough to the falls you can always head over there after its done and make a weekend of it.
