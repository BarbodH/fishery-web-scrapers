772091,wallyboss,2013-03-06 15:22:00,1095,"I was in Dominican republic last week and I watched a few episodes in spanish, they are even funnier when you have no idea what teh heck they are saying."
745952,ch312,2012-11-23 15:16:00,1590, many shows and documentaries on tv have shown the purchase and use of illegal drugs. i'm thinking there must be some privacy legal mumbo jumbo that the film crews can't report the offenders to the police if they agree to be filmed for a documentary?
745956,Brettiop,2012-11-23 15:30:00,279," Ya, I constantly hear people raving about this show.....i turned the channel after 5 minutes, booooring an wayyyyy scripted...  Maybe ill give it another chance but first impression was terrible"
745965,cityfisher,2012-11-23 15:54:00,959,i like there old shows on hunting/fishing channels... buck commannder and duck commander... this shows is for the masses to laugh at hillbillies
745973,jedimaster,2012-11-23 16:15:00,3472,I like laughing at hillbillies. It makes me feel normal. I don't watch this expecting a fishing or hunting show. Its like jersey shore for men.
745975,Thrilla,2012-11-23 16:20:00,164,"Pretty stale if you ask me, not funny, at all really... Always see it on and flip there but flip to something else fairly quick... Too scripted and like I already said, not funny"
745978,moose,2012-11-23 16:24:00,266,Funny show ever We need a lot more like that on tv
746218,Billy Bob,2012-11-24 13:34:00,5865,Don't need to watch it....I'm living it every day........and it's....   GREAT TO BE A REDNECK        But it is my HOT WIFE'S favorite show.....
746382,blaque,2012-11-25 00:32:00,2419,Just saw the commercial for the next discovery hit show.  AMISH MAFIA  And no I'm not kidding  We have only ourselves to blame for watching the deadliest catch lol
746468,Rich,2012-11-25 11:17:00,3927,"Thats not really their wives, they arent really rednecks, or family. Its a funny show, but poorly acted/scripted and anyone who believes there is the slightest speck of reality in the show needs to give their head a huge shake.  Cant watch that garbage personally. Though ive never been fond of a lot of the mind melting crap on the idiot box."
746474,outllaw,2012-11-25 12:10:00,1232,"Silly yes. its entertainment. at least they show family,how it matters and have family dinners and give thanks. thats all good."
747071,Billy Bob,2012-11-27 12:44:00,5865, Actually a LOT of it is TRUE.....the old man....PHIL ROBINSON was a starting QB at LSU as reported this past Sunday on FOX NFL Sunday (their pregame show).......and here's the rest of the story....  http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/redneck-millionaires-built-duck-dynasty-duck-call-business/story?id=15961955#.ULS0H-SK2Lw
747911,northernpike56,2012-11-30 04:20:00,717,"Don't want to stir anything up on here.... but I've been told to watch it by a few friends from school, cause I find the types of people on that show quite 'entertaining'. While I may laugh at some stereotypes while watching some youtube clips I've seen, I could certainly never live anywhere down there.  just my $0.02."
747939,Rich,2012-11-30 13:30:00,3927,What does a former career in entertainment have to do with the reality of a poorly acted pseudo-hunting show?
747953,RangerGuy,2012-11-30 14:10:00,564,"Duck Commander is awesome! These guys are so funny LOL!...  Embrace your internal Redneck!!  Happy ,Happy ,Happy"
748234,Billy Bob,2012-12-01 11:04:00,5865, SOMEBODY sounds a bit JEALOUS.....
748243,misfish,2012-12-01 11:43:00,29133," Thanks for the reed,BB.  I have no problem with the show. Like said,ENTERTAINMENT.  Redneck with a sippy cup."
748244,Billy Bob,2012-12-01 11:50:00,5865, As long as you're....HAPPY...HAPPY...HAPPY...
748254,Rich,2012-12-01 12:48:00,3927,"Damn right im jealous. I work my ass off to get by. These idiots literally do nothing, and are rich beyond your wildest dreams. They act like a high school drama class, yet are making more money than people who have spent their whole lives trying to break into the world of acting. I'm sure many in tv/movies agree, these ""reality"" shows make tv look ridiculously mindless. It really did become the idiot box."
748257,Billy Bob,2012-12-01 12:57:00,5865, But you could always take up making duck calls or deer calls or moose calls or turkey calls or coyote calls....or....here's a good one I haven't seen yet....FISH CALLS....
748258,Rich,2012-12-01 12:58:00,3927,Fish dynasty hmmmm maybe thats my ticket to fame lol
771969,misfish,2013-03-05 20:25:00,29133,8.2 million watched the new season premier. Happy happy happy. Pass the sippie cup.
771972,bare foot wader,2013-03-05 20:52:00,1354,  In the pilot season the contract was likely a flat rate with bonus at end of season if ratings were strong enough...for all consecutive seasons it is a rate per episode with season ending bonus depending on ratings  that is on top of their mining revenues (or lack thereof)    LOL   blowing up a duck blind and making a bad ass blind out of an old rv...that's awesome
771993,misfish,2013-03-05 22:28:00,29133,"They are rich already,and the $,s are pouring in just on t,s and what ever else has their name on it. Their bringing it on like Donkey Kong"

745674,GYPSY400,2012-11-22 03:03:00,191,I want a Si cup for Christmas...  They can be found on the Duck Commander website.

745695,Grimace,2012-11-22 04:34:00,2020,I tried to get through ten minutes of one of the episodes tonight.  Couldn't do it.  I have no idea what the attraction to this show is.
745696,Joey,2012-11-22 04:35:00,9122,I love it!!
745699,tb4me,2012-11-22 04:43:00,3295,"Awesome show..Its on like donkey kong, jack!"
745706,Marko,2012-11-22 06:03:00,854,Great show....watched a whole season in one sitting http://www.free-tv-video-online.me/internet/duck_dynasty/ LInk for those who would like to check it out  Jepp has the hottest wife on DD...Jessica....
745711,Handlebarz,2012-11-22 11:16:00,3790,Marko how do you watch them down load and watch on TV? How long does it take to down load a show and did you subscribe or use the free section? there are a few seasons I would like to get from here
745850,LefroyFisherman,2012-11-23 00:40:00,602,Great show! Love it.
745856,Stoty,2012-11-23 01:19:00,2910,"One of my fav shows for sure!!!  Willie has a MINT wife, MINT truck and MINT bass boat!  Si and Jase crack me up, big time!"
745864,Moosebunk,2012-11-23 01:37:00,3970,PVR'd a crudload of 'em shows past couple days.  Will have to see what all the fuss is aboot!
745866,nroadrunner,2012-11-23 01:47:00,113,"Very Scripted for the most part but Si is the man  lol   ""A beaver is about like the ninjas.....The suckers only work at night and are hard to find""  Silas Robertson    Ian"
745880,HTHM,2012-11-23 02:34:00,4082,It is amazing the amount of things Si did in the military. Their interactions remind me of my family growing up.
745882,Stoty,2012-11-23 02:39:00,2910, I'm not sure about that....seems like those are their everyday things. They can just afford to do them all the time because they're rich. lol
745883,danbouck,2012-11-23 02:41:00,4380,I love it
745897,danc,2012-11-23 03:22:00,4677,"First time that I've actually watched it was last night in my motel room in Dryden. I was rooming with a 20 something year old apprentice who laughed his head off for the entire 3 hours that it was on. When this kid isn't watching some silly sitcom on tv and laughing his head off (which is very annoying), he's playing some kind of video game on his phone. See where I'm going with this? I chuckled once or twice, but it takes way more than Duck Dynasty to stimulate my mind. Sorry, but it isn't for me."
745899,kickingfrog,2012-11-23 03:30:00,8333,"My mistake, I thought this was about Huey, Dewey, and Louie.    Very little reality in reality tv, but you do get what you pay for."
745901,TJQ,2012-11-23 03:48:00,7806,"Id say most of it is pretty scripted, but what isnt... Lol. Getting to see someone crawfish fishing andthen pumpin a clip of  an m16 into a beaver house, then getting out the flame thrower...  Welll as redneck as that is...  I had to laugh... Then again.. They are just like southern kin.. Cept i dont wear that much camo...lol"
745907,blaque,2012-11-23 04:26:00,2419,"Scripted is an understatement. All of those shows are. I'm not saying they aren't entertaining but they are certainly set up for tv.  I mean come on, moonshiners? Ur telling me that they air video of an illegal activity and then air video of the sheriffs trying to bust them. But can't find them? Ummmm, the same camera guys taping the cops just taped the moonshiners DUH!!  Gold rush? Do you really believe that these guys are still scraping for money to feed their families. Gambling their last dime to make it in mining? After 3 seasons of being on a hit tv show"
745909,Gerritt,2012-11-23 04:31:00,6129,Uhmmmm show the hot wives....... Sex sells? Thinking every fat unshaved redneck can land the prom queen? Yup reality
745919,pikehunter,2012-11-23 11:06:00,1659," Yep. I did the same. Then one day I actually sat through the whole show. Now I'm hooked! I want to go down there and work for them! Hell, I'll work for free!"
