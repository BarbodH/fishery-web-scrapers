772067,Rod Caster,2013-03-06 12:55:00,5784,"I dont' care if the guy kept it, just cashing in on an opportunity to jab a Trout Creekian  (Uncle lives there...he keeps everything too!).  Can't image that thing tasting good unless you stuffed it's massive cavity with 6 pounds of garlic, pepper and salt. The only REALLY nice eating lakers I've seen are from LSPP, like the one in Joey's thread."
772076,Joey,2013-03-06 13:46:00,9122," It's not burned Wayne, it's called ""aggressively cooked"""
772077,TJQ,2013-03-06 14:03:00,7806,"There are a few lakes to the west and northwest of temagami, where the lakers dont get very big.  The flesh has a very pink hue.. As a matter of fact if i recall correctly we used to catch the odd one on the north end of temagami as well. Ive eaten pickeral all my life and i will tell you those small pink lakers beat any pickeral hands down for eating, much meatier and no ""trouty"" taste. I was told once that the pink meat was due to the fact that in tose smaler lakes they feed primarily on crayfish. Dunno if it true but its possible.  Just dont ""aggressively cook""them."
772099,irishfield,2013-03-06 15:39:00,26272,"Lake Temagami has both white flesh and orange/pink flesh Lakers. Some seem to like eating fish and others crustaceans. Kokoko's are generally white. Here's one from my favourite back lake.. never stocked that I can find and all the fish that we've managed to pull up (100+ one day, Lloyd and I) are all about 20"" long and this colour. We've been told my a biologist that the fish are smart enough to eat to the food level of the lake.  "
772103,Carp,2013-03-06 15:46:00,1488,SWEET CATCH !!!
772110,4x4bassin,2013-03-06 16:05:00,1025,"I have been told the same thing about the pink/orange flesh on the lakers , but it's because they are planktivorous (basicly bug eaters) and not fish eaters like those greasers you get out of Simcoe (white/grey flesh) In general as well , a planktivorous feeding lake trout population will be much smaller in size (weight) compared to there fish eating cousins and there overall appearance and taste will be noticably better from my experience . Back to the topic , that is a beauty lake trout and he does have every right to keep it but I can probably say that it would not be making good table fare at that size !"
772112,TJQ,2013-03-06 16:14:00,7806,Good to know I kinda know what im talking about.. lol   Double soaked and double smoked!!  LOL
772115,Woodsman,2013-03-06 16:16:00,1286,When you click on the link for the story a funny thing appears. The story is dated tomorrow 3 days after this thread started. Accurate reporting?????
772117,ecmilley,2013-03-06 16:19:00,2163,"also seen that with brook trout, white flesh always filled with minnows and orange flesh usually freshwater shrimp and other shelled thingy's  ate a 7-8 lb trout out of chando's few years ago white flesh tasted like a old boot guess it ate herring, same as quinte walters eating shad greasy and pretty much tasteless"
772128,Bernie,2013-03-06 17:24:00,3190,"Nice fish. I know that guy, good fellow. He likely kept it and ate it. He would not waste it.I'll ask him how it tasted the next time I see him."
772148,Jds63,2013-03-06 18:56:00,1365,I would love to know what lure he still had in its mouth ... I lost a giant there 3 weeks ago
771872,kickingfrog,2013-03-05 03:39:00,8333,"http://www.nugget.ca/2013/03/04/35-lb-lake-trout-caught   Last Thursday, Trout Creek's Keith Linklater was fishing with John Harding, of Temagami Lake On-Ice Bungalows, and landed this 35 lb lake trout. Linklater said it was a day with strong north winds and blowing snow. He caught the fish at 10:30 a.m. in 115 feet of water on Lake Temagami. It measured 42 inches long with a girth of 25 inches. On closer inspection, Linklater found another line hanging out of its mouth."
771874,NAW,2013-03-05 03:42:00,4022,That's a tank.!
771875,Joey,2013-03-05 03:43:00,9122,"Wow, that is a brute!!!"
771876,irishfield,2013-03-05 03:43:00,26272,"Needs to gain about 6"" to beat Lloyd's 2010 fish... but another wonderful Lake T tanker ! Sad it looks a little stiff though..."
771889,Acountdeleted,2013-03-05 05:53:00,2562,What a monster!
771891,fishindevil,2013-03-05 08:21:00,6254,Wow !!!!!! That's more like a freshwater submarine !!!!! What a huge laker ...... I wonder how old the trout is 30yrs ????? Awesome  congrats to him.....
771901,Terry,2013-03-05 10:05:00,14456,I have seen bigger from the lake  never caught one   nice fish
771908,Angler management,2013-03-05 12:08:00,280,Ya pretty sad somebody would keep that...
771910,Rod Caster,2013-03-05 13:02:00,5784,From Trout Creek...guaranteed that fish got pan fried with bacon.
771917,LucG,2013-03-05 13:57:00,779," Yup, looks like it had been on the ice for a bit before the pic was taken."
771922,adempsey,2013-03-05 14:29:00,1498,I think I need to live where catching a 35lb Laker makes front page news.   Lol.
771931,TJQ,2013-03-05 15:40:00,7806,  Yup... its nice and slow up here... lol.. there's a reason i moved back....  Nice fish... he bought the licence he can keep it!!  Im pretty sure that hauling anything up from that depth would be the end of it no matter what... Hes best off to keep it rather than risk wasting it in my opinion!
771932,Dara,2013-03-05 15:59:00,3052,"Nice fish...when the MNR says you can keep it, then keep it...they are the fish gods after all"
771933,Angler management,2013-03-05 16:17:00,280,"Seriously??? Mnr tells u you can keep a muskie over 52"" u gonna keep it??? I know its a trout, but regardless, if its worth more to you on a dinnerplate then in the water or on your line again, no comment..."
771935,chris.brock,2013-03-05 16:23:00,4053,"  even small lakers are pretty poor table fare, I wouldn't want to try that giant  I guess with enough seasoning, even a dog turd could be eaten by some"
771936,jedimaster,2013-03-05 16:32:00,3472,"110 fow up to the top is real tough on a fish. If you are fishing deep and bring it up its not good for it for sure. Lake trout though are able to adjust them selves much better than say walleye, but still thats real deep. Great fish, within slots and possesion. I see no problem with keeping it if thats his thing."
771937,TJQ,2013-03-05 16:52:00,7806,  LOL>. When they are that big I smoke them.... but small lakers up north... better than walleye as far as im concerned.
771940,ecmilley,2013-03-05 17:33:00,2163,mmmmmmmm smoked trout
771999,Nipfisher,2013-03-05 22:58:00,2449," I had a Delicous 20"" Lake Trout last week. I covered it with butter, spices, and cesar salad dressing and wrapped it in foil. 17 minutes per side on the bar-b-que. Best I have ever had."
772026,Moosebunk,2013-03-06 01:43:00,3970,"A beautiful fish and an amazing catch.  Terry's right... there are bigger in there but it's not everyday an angler in Ontario catches a 35lb'er through the ice in ANY part of the province.  Maybe it's headed for the wall.  Maybe a septic system.  Anglers choice.  Lakers for eating can be great from one place and terrible from others.  I'm with ya TJ... battered and fried in the pan they ""can"" be every bit as tasty as walleye."
772037,irishfield,2013-03-06 02:40:00,26272,"Yep.. I deep fry the little guys we get downrigging, that hit the boat DOA after ripping up from 100FOW, and they taste no different than an 'eye. Also good on the BBQ.. cook flesh side first, then flip and burn the skin side 'till it chars and they taste like BBQ chicken.. either that or it's just that "" burned taste"" I give everything on the grill. I did  the first laker I got in the oven as suggested by many... wasn't fit for a dog.  The big guy that this thread is all about... probably long out of the breeding cycle and just out there cruising around eating anything that got in front of it's mouth (including that little laker Terry was reeling up last winter! LOL). Most just snap people off.. so the odd one hitting the wall that size doesn't get me the least bit excited from one of the largest inland fresh water lakes in Canada."
772042,kickingfrog,2013-03-06 02:54:00,8333,"People can eat what ever they want, however they want. Personal preferences and tastes are exactly that.  But if your walleye and lake trout taste the same you're cooking one, or likely both, wrongâ€¦ or using enough Catchup to make a 10 year old gag."
772044,irishfield,2013-03-06 02:59:00,26272,If they're both eating the same forage basically.. no reason they won't taste very similar. On Temagami we bring all species out of the same hole in 78FOW!
772061,chris.brock,2013-03-06 08:02:00,4053," I've only eaten lakers from Haliburton, pretty tasteless, a little muddy, with a slight rubbery texture, very different from a walleye up there, same lake/ forage base or not"
772062,chris.brock,2013-03-06 08:07:00,4053," cover anything with butter, spices and dressing and it'll be palatable"
