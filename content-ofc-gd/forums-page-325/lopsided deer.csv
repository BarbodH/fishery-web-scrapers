771808,lew,2013-03-04 23:31:00,12766,"Yeah, it was nice to see that owl as there doesn't appear to be many around this area. He actually sat in the tree and watched me as I walked up to within 50' of him to take the last picture."
771893,fishindevil,2013-03-05 08:39:00,6254,Hey Lew you should try and put out a salt lick block !!!! The deer will be there all winter and have fun licking the salt !!!! It looks like they like your evergreen trees and shelter in your yard !!!!set up one of them blocks and they will be there all the time !!!!! Cheers
771894,fishindevil,2013-03-05 08:41:00,6254,As for the owl !!!! That's awesome !!!! Great pic too ... What an awesome bird they are ....
772113,Carp,2013-03-06 16:15:00,1488,Sweet pics guys. I would think having a big ole antler hanging on on one side of your head would eventually give you a bit of a headache / neckache.
772118,lew,2013-03-06 16:20:00,12766, I'd imagine a moose would agree with you Remo
771527,lew,2013-03-03 23:36:00,12766,"I live on the edge of some heavy woods that are loaded with deer during the winter months. A couple times a day some of them wander out into my yard and there's anywhere from 6-10 each time. Mostly doe's and a couple younguns, but the odd buck wanders out too and that's always great to see.  The last couple days I've had a large buck in the yard with only one antler, so I assume that one will be falling off soon too.  Anyhoo, I decided to take a couple pics of them today. These were taken from about 150' away but you should be able to see the missing antler.  Here's a couple doe's    And here's the buck      Maybe it's just me, but I like this kinda stuff."
771530,BillM,2013-03-03 23:40:00,17367,"Lew if you ever need someone to thing those out, you just let me know, lol!"
771531,davey buoy,2013-03-03 23:41:00,5505,"Must be something to see on a regular basis deer in your yard. I like the wildlife as well,but in my area,mostly birds. lol.Great pics Lew!!!!!"
771533,Joey,2013-03-03 23:55:00,9122,Little piece of heaven you live in there Lew  You should go take a look for the lost antler for your wall

771537,BillM,2013-03-04 00:06:00,17367,"Not to steal lew's thunder, but this is what my dad is greeted with pretty much everyday.   If he doesn't feed them, they'll hang out in the backyard until he does!  "
771564,Whopper,2013-03-04 01:58:00,2174,Cool shots Lew
771567,Beans,2013-03-04 02:07:00,3339,"Saw a herd of about a dozen deer wander out of our back roadway onto our main road last Friday evening, then half of them wandered down to the backyard of my neighbor across the road and the rest bolted back down to where they came from...too dark to get pictures this time...they never seen to amaze me..."
771568,danc,2013-03-04 02:11:00,4677,Always nice to see Deer in the backyard Lew. Nice shots. Lopsiders are cool and are only around for a couple weeks and  at the right time of the year. Here's a favorite of mine from last year.  
771615,Rattletrap2,2013-03-04 04:21:00,1652,"They are beautiful animals Lew. We don't see them too often. The snow is so deep here this month and I think they are staying deeper in the woods. I have not seen any Turkeys in a while either. I would much rather see turkey's off in the distance. My Buddy feeds them in his yard and they are dirty beasts. lol The deer come around in the spring to devour the tulips! Can't say I mind though. They were here first! My Wife wants a vegetable garden, but I'm afraid that would be a loosing battle! We have a rabbit around the house these days and I'm sure it would do a number on a vegetable garden."
771616,Rattletrap2,2013-03-04 04:21:00,1652,Awesome shot Dan!
771633,wormdunker,2013-03-04 07:37:00,1711,Thanx for the beautiful pix.  U guys r awesome!
771637,lew,2013-03-04 10:34:00,12766,"Thanks folks, glad you enjoyed the pictures and thanks for adding some more pictures too Bill & Dan. We've got a vegetable garden at the back of the yard Brian, right at the edge of the woods, and have never had a problem with critters, not even rabbits.  Actually, once the snow is gone so are the deer and we almost never see them during the summer, but when the snow returns in December, so do the deer."
771638,outllaw,2013-03-04 10:44:00,1232,thanx guys.the best things in life are free. all you gotta do is look.
771639,crappieperchhunter,2013-03-04 10:44:00,2582,Nice looking neighbors you have Lew   I life in the city and rabbits have always been a problem but they only eat my peas and beans when they are small plants they have never eaten anything else. I just stake up a 2 foot high chicken wire fence around them until the plants are in flower. For some reason once they have grown that much the rabbits will leave them alone.
771641,lew,2013-03-04 10:52:00,12766, You got that 100% correct George
771648,lew,2013-03-04 12:12:00,12766,I looked out the kitchen window 15 minutes ago to see a big ole owl sitting in the tree just above where those deer pictures were taken.  Don't see too many owls so it's always good when one shows up....to me anyways    
771657,Roy,2013-03-04 12:51:00,13728,"Wow, it was dark out too! You have better eyes than the owl!  Great shot Lew."
771694,4x4bassin,2013-03-04 16:02:00,1025,"Nice shots Lew , thanks for sharing !"
771705,fishindevil,2013-03-04 16:25:00,6254,"awesome pics lew !!! great to see all the locals,we have them around where i live as well we see the turkeys all the time as well as deer at least a few times per week...thanks for sharing..."
771707,Beans,2013-03-04 16:26:00,3339,MMMMMMMmmmmmmm...Rabbit stew with fresh peas and beans...
771742,Rod Caster,2013-03-04 19:35:00,5784,Love the owl shots! nice suprise. What's next? haha
771761,Rattletrap2,2013-03-04 21:15:00,1652,"Very nice Lew. With that big Owl around, you better keep Ol' Marvin on a short lead! Those beautiful owl shots might just entice another wise old owl (Ron) to pop up!"
771790,Joey,2013-03-04 22:40:00,9122,Beautiful owl shots Lew.  That is way too cool to see
771801,iFish4real,2013-03-04 23:05:00,386,hmmm...make's me wanna tickle the trigger
