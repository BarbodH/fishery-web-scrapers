771803,Steve,2013-03-04 23:16:00,2075,"man to have fished quinte in the 90's.  since 2002 when I started fishing quinte, and following it very closely (including the message boards) i've yet to see a picture of a 16lbs'er (aside from ole mallards).  i know the guides have put an informal bounty in place for a real 16lbs'er...they too have not seen one in the 2000's - cept for jimmy johnson who caught a 16 on camera with angler/hunter tv.  but i've heard of all kinds of big fish in the 90's....just not since.  my boat has not cracked 15lbs. still dreamin'."
771892,fishindevil,2013-03-05 08:33:00,6254,"Seen a legit 16lb walleye at the old bay view inn in deseronto back in the late 80,s and a few more in the early 90""s !!!!! It was insane back then there were some fish caught in the 20lb range but to even see a 16lb weighed was awesome !!!!!! Check to old tourney weights from back then and 14lbers were fairly common !!!!!! My personal best from quinte was 13.3lbs and a 12.9lb from the Ottawa river !!!! But I know tere was a 20lb caught in quinte back in the mid 90""s David aka super dad I beige can confirm it ???"

771920,Headhunter,2013-03-05 14:19:00,5703,"Yah, the 90's was the hayday for Quinte... a bad day out was 20 fish! Best day ever was a 35 fish day. We had north west winds steady at 40k, with gusts of 60-80k. It was not a day for the faint of heart. Actually there was only one other boat out that day, they never got past the pump house in Picton. Four of us bouncing around in the boat, (20ft Targa -glass boat with a 225 merc)we never got out as far as the cement plant... 5 footers plus! We left the launch in the dark, dropped our lines as soon as we passed the pump house and had a triple header on within 200 yds. I'm pretty sure I got my PB that day, 14.5lbs. Got a crappy pic of it somewhere as it was still dark and we were struggling to keep lines in the water. I have personally seen one 16lb pickereye, numerous fish in the 12-14lb range. Funny how jaded you get when every fish is a teenager! Got to the point where only fish pics were taken of 13+lbers. It got to the point that day, that the guys out with us were saying, no you go ahead and reel that fish in, my arms are still aching from the last fish! I don't think we will ever see that again, since the Bay has changed so much since that time. Also, during the 90's, seeing more than 5 boats out would be a really busy day! These days, you're in line with 5 boats at the launch! HH"

771223,Joeytier,2013-03-02 03:12:00,3990,"Chad, that 15 pounder must have been incredibly fat to only be 30 inches.  I've caught a couple in the 8-9 lbs range out of Lake O. that were high 20's..."

771257,OhioFisherman,2013-03-02 06:58:00,6623,"I netted my buddy`s 31 inch walleye at Pointe au Baril, like Terry`s fish it seemed to have a problem, long and skinny, it only weighed like 9 pound 2 ounces.  Sort of odd for a mid to late September fish to be that skinny? My uncle also had gotten an 11 pounder a few years earlier at Pointe Au Baril, right after the season opened.  I got a 28 incher there that weighed a solid 8 pounds, chunky rascal. Saw other people in various camps we stayed at there with bigger ones than we got.  The bait store on HWY 69 ( E&E?) had a picture of a guy with a 16 pounder caught in Pointe au Baril, and from the pic? it looked right."
771262,mike rousseau,2013-03-02 08:00:00,4661,The one I lost last fall boatside.... Probably biggest walleye ill ever see in person....
771264,manitoubass2,2013-03-02 08:23:00,11391,"My biggest is 32"" at 12lbs. But I've caught alot right near that length/weight.  Last year prefishing with my bud down in the sault narrows, he hooked a monster walleye. As it approached the boat I wished we had a longer net. I made one scoop at her and missed. The fish then broke the line at the top of the water about  6 feet from the boat.  The tailsplash as she escaped was as heartbreaking as it was a thing of beauty.  I'd guess 35"" but its tough to tell on a fish like that. It was a spring pig too.  We were both very bummed"
771271,lew,2013-03-02 10:47:00,12766,"My grandparents had a water front home on Simcoe many years ago and ""ole gramps"" used to get alot of big fish back in the day. Biggest pickerel was 18 pounds that he caught and I netted. We measured it on a couple different scales.  That was way back in 1961 and I doubt there's any like that left today.  "

771305,ehg,2013-03-02 16:10:00,2666,I think a member here (Superdad) caught a 20.25 lb. walleye on Quinte many years ago.  I remember ice fishing Talbot River/Lake Simcoe by Gamebridge last week of March in the 90's and people walking by with 20 lb. walleyes they KEPT.  There is a world record walleyes in Lake Simcoe or Lake Ontario/Quinte. no doubt.

771319,OhioFisherman,2013-03-02 17:36:00,6623,"http://arkansasroadstories.com/nature/walleye.html  If you read the story and apply the logic? With the demise of the walleye fishing on the Great Lakes in the 50`s and 60`s a lot more tourists headed to Canada to fish for them. The cottage industry was booming, Canadian`s personal income was rising, as was American`s. Travel and the time to do so was becoming easier.  Canadians and tourists were trophy hunting, something to take home to show for results of a vacation? and catch and release was unheard of. Then figure in the population growth of Ontario, I am pretty sure Lew and guys my age saw a lot of outsized fish "" back in the day""? and didn`t have to go as far to see them."

Ok, so it's barely plausible but I like to believe it's true. We all saw that pic of the 34"" (i think it was 34"") walleye from Temagami....I'm wondering what other first hand or sixth hand stories you've heard of big walleye coming from Canadian waters.  I've also seen my buddy pull in a 15 pound walleye from Nosobonsing, It measured around 30 inches.  My biggest walleye from an back lake was around 24"""

I believe there are 35"" walleye in Lake Nipissing and in the upper French River however I was skeptical about the 18 pound weight that was claimed. I have seen 12 and 13 pounders from a local lake and seen a couple of 11 pound walleye from the French River this summer.
