771555,serrouljm,2013-03-04 01:26:00,1,"Hello All!  I just moved to Ottawa from Nova Scotia, and am seeking information about trout fishing, on the fly, in the Ottawa area.  I am a strictly catch & release fisherman, so I'm not gonna clear out your waters (not that I'm good enough if I weren't!).  I grew up on spooky little brook trout in cool running streams, and it's my favorite. I'm gonna play with other species now that I'm here, but I'd love some basic info on where to start my search for brookies.  I'd never ask for specific spots (not that anyone would give up a honey hole anyway), but some basic lay-of-the-land/water would be awesome.  I'll drive a reasonable distance, like to hike and love to earn my fish with a good trek. I'd rather not catch than overfish a pressured spot or fish next to the road.  Either way, I loved NovaScotiaFishing.com, and I hope I can learn from, and add to, ontariofishingcommnity.com.  (Now to sit back and wait for prime fishing spots to be emailed to me with GPS coordinates...)  john"
