130233,TJQ,2007-11-05 17:12:00,7806,"Well we headed up to Camp Jiggy Jiggy for a quick weekend trip with the kids... the weather certainly cooperated with sunny days and nits down to minus 4 or so...  We battened down the hatches for the winter up there, and got out on a great 4 wheeler afternoon, covering about 50km.  Managed a couple partridges as well and I got to show the wifey a great beach that Avery and I had come upon a few weeks ago.  Gonna be a great spot to go in August!!!  Heres some pics from the weekend...  Friday nites sunset.. at 6:30   ... gulp!!    The beach we found... stays shallow for about 50 feet then drops off.    The birds we got, its been a slow year for partridge this year....    Monique's famous vertical hold.    Jaden gets to clean them!!!  LOL.. hey.. someone has to do it!!    Yum!!! Deer sausage patties and partridge for breakfast!!!    The glow of a warm camp on a cold nite.  "
