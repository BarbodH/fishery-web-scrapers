131121,Fishnfiend,2007-11-07 20:37:00,357,I didn't think they liked the hides in a garbage bag (let alone sealed)????? Don't they decompose/rot in plastic? I have always understood that salted if at all possible and in a cardboard box....
131142,Fishmaster,2007-11-07 21:17:00,920,they are froze when i get them ...never rot in the freezer
131147,Fishnfiend,2007-11-07 21:28:00,357,"OK, fair enough.  I just know that when you take them in early bow season, they want them in cardborad and salted if possible."
131150,Fishmaster,2007-11-07 21:34:00,920,Only problem with salting them it makes a big mess ....blood and water come out fast and i really don't want that mess in my tackle store ..
