131313,Fishmaster,2007-11-08 03:23:00,920,Snow or no Snow Fish or no Fish looks like alote more fun then *orking to me ...love the winter shots ..and you can't say you didn't try ..next pic's will have a hog laying beside the boat with slush around it ..
131314,Joey,2007-11-08 03:25:00,9122,"Well no matter what happened, the weather, the skunk, it was still a better day than I had a work I can guarantee!!  Nice pics from both of you.  Love the traffic Jam  Joey"
131316,TJQ,2007-11-08 03:27:00,7806,Brrr........  brrr.........   just friggin.... brrr.....  Lew .. Ive never seen you so happy!!
131336,solopaddler,2007-11-08 04:00:00,8605,"That's what it's all about boys, cold, snow, wind and the shot at a gargantuan fish. Doesn't matter if you catch or not, Georgian Bay is an almost mystical place to be this time of year if you're a musky fisherman."
131359,bassmastermike,2007-11-08 07:13:00,295,Looks Like a great day out wish i was there too Oh and i keep saying this (Mabey next time Wayne) !! LOL
131362,motv8tr,2007-11-08 07:38:00,2587,"Well another good outing, one of these times you'll entice a couple of big girls into the boat.  Lew, I bet you were happy to be going north and not south  with everyone else.  Just glad you made the trip safely.  Maureen"
131370,Terry,2007-11-08 11:26:00,14456,good report catching fish is always just a bonus..         I sure hope we get lots of bonuses at BOQ
131371,Rich Clemens,2007-11-08 11:27:00,3131,Great report and pics Wayne.  Looks like truely die-hard conditions out on the bay ... or maybe gettin' close.  Good to see you guys getting out together ... fish or no fish.
131390,Spiel,2007-11-08 12:26:00,9065,"....Bitter, cold, windy and the lake to yourself, Perfect!"
131392,lew,2007-11-08 12:27:00,12767,  Wait'll you see me when I'm having a LOUSY day
131395,ccmtcanada,2007-11-08 12:33:00,7971,"Great report Wayne!  My view on fishing has a lot to do with what Lew said when I first joined the board (and he still says it from time to time).  You cant catch anything from your living room!  Looked cold and windy....def not a day for my little tinny, but then again, some of my best fishing days are in those conidtions."
131223,irishfield,2007-11-08 00:51:00,26272,"Well, Lew got lucky and he didn't have to shovel the 1400 foot laneway to meet me at the house!    But he did drive thru some wild stuff to get here. Leah was listening to the radio, while I got the boat ready, and called out to me in the hangar and said there was 60 accidents from Innisfil Beach Road North to Orillia and was worried Lew would get delayed...but I had faith. Lew was right on time!  We took the boat down the whole mile to the Midland launch...and i did have to shovel it (actually used the shovel to throw water on the snow to wash it away) Got the boat in and ready to go...no foot prints but our own..and nothing changed when we reloaded the boat after dark.     So we hit the bay and did the mandatory troll of the harbour. Lots of bait in that water in front of the elevators/town dock...but never seem to connect with any of the big hooks that accompany them.    Funny the difference a mile makes...This shot shows Midland Point snowless and it snowing pretty hard in Midland itself.    Definitely wasn't a 14 foot tinny day out there....    Honest he's happy...he really is .... lol    We viewed some beautiful scenery...when we could actually see it    Covered about 50 miles of water and endured some snow, sleet, wind..      And came up absolutely empty handed at the end of the day. Doesn't change the fact that we had a wonderful day on the water and no matter what it was better than Peter's day ! LOL Sorry Pete..couldn't resist!  This was the only traffic jam that we encountered comin home to re-load the boat.     Thanks again Lew...for another wonderful day on the water..and Lunch!  And sorry Andy.. the kid backed out on me this morning when he saw the weather!"
131226,Squid,2007-11-08 00:53:00,1656,Thanks Irish!! All I could do was dream of what you guys were doing.
131230,irishfield,2007-11-08 00:54:00,26272,We'd hoped to get a big gal..so we could call you to say your day just got worse!
131232,2 tone z71,2007-11-08 00:55:00,1311,"Nice pics WAS cold, and damm my E tec dont smoke like that lol JK,I gave up on the ski hunt for 07 I got 2 this fall and missed many, time to put the rest of my gear away"
131233,BFSC Kevin,2007-11-08 00:58:00,1351,no fish? always next time! atleast you two had tonnes of fun!
131234,danc,2007-11-08 00:58:00,4677,Aw man. That's awesome. I wish I was out there there with you guys. Great report Lew and Wayne.
131235,Mike the Pike,2007-11-08 00:59:00,3421,Funny not to see the Turkeys on your lawn.Sure looks like you had a better day than us cause we were all working. If Lew is happy he sure looks frosty.What no pics of the captain maybe you had a bad case of bed head Nice pics Wayne although I like my tiller you must enjoy the full protection of the roof and windshield.  
131236,irishfield,2007-11-08 00:59:00,26272," LOL 2 tone..that's just exhaust..they do it above water. Ask Glen what I think of the Etec. One of them rattling things was running at the dock when we launched on Saturday. I almost sprayed them with water, with my motor tilted up, as I couldn't hear my Verado running and I over rev'd it a tad!"
131239,Squid,2007-11-08 01:05:00,1656,HAHAHAHA that would have been funny Wayne!
131241,Weeds,2007-11-08 01:08:00,782,No fish but nice report all the same. Looks beautiful out there; definetly getting frosty. I want one more ski myself before season ends here in the Kawarthas. Not much time left!
131244,irishfield,2007-11-08 01:11:00,26272, No turkeys...but I almost pinged off two deer in the laneway coming home!
131251,Roy,2007-11-08 01:22:00,13728,Great report and some fine pics guys. How much warmer was the water compared to air temp? Looks like you had a great day. Glad Lew was able to slalom around all the fender benders.
131255,irishfield,2007-11-08 01:28:00,26272,"Water in Midland Harbour..actually at the launch...47.5F, but there's a stream coming in there. On the main lake 50.1F  Air was -2C to start and truck thermo pulling boat home 1C"
131257,lew,2007-11-08 01:29:00,12767,"Another awesome day has come & gone Wayne, and as usual, it's always a pleasure to spend another day on the water with you. No fish this trip, but that's never mandatory for a good day of fish'n anyways.  It looked chilly out there, but it wasn't really as bad as it looked, infact I don't think I even put my coat on till about 2:00 or so when the temps started dropping again.  The drive from Penetang back to the Smoke this evening was a heck of a lot easier than the drive north at 6:00 this morning, cept for the fact that my cruise control decided to take a vacation  ...... Have to get that fixed tomorrow before I head to Windsor this weekend.  Here's a couple shots of the hiway up around Barrie about 7:00 this morning      Sorry Wayne, but I had a good shot of you in the boat , at least I thought I did, but it never showed up on the camera.   Oh well,  I'll take 2 of you next time to make up for it.  Thanks again for another great day Wayne, the pleasure was all mine"
131259,irishfield,2007-11-08 01:32:00,26272, No need to ruin peoples suppers anyhow Lew!
131260,duckdog,2007-11-08 01:33:00,162,"Man I miss living in that area, I used to fish Hogg's Bay, Matchedash, Little lake and quite a few little ponds, I gotta get back up to visit buddies and thank Irishfield in person :-) Great pics I have not bin out in awhile :-("
131261,Guest gbfisher,2007-11-08 01:34:00,0,"Could have been there by 6 if you called me at 4:30.  Now thats fishin!! At least you didn't have to contend with this first thing.......  ]  Looks like  fun.  lots of time to get another yet...        Stan the Musky man Nowacin is out on Friday. 85, two 20 hp mercs, 20' King boat.  I can only hope to be able to do that at his age."
131263,Dano,2007-11-08 01:37:00,719,Way to get out there and stick with it guys! Looks pretty chilly!
131265,lew,2007-11-08 01:38:00,12767," Shoulda called me Andy, I coulda swung by & picked you up"
131266,irishfield,2007-11-08 01:39:00,26272, Was just a training trip for next week bud!
131267,irishfield,2007-11-08 01:40:00,26272, If I hadn't told him there wasn't a third spot for him...feel bad..but I had to give the kid a chance! Won't happen again...
131269,Dano,2007-11-08 01:42:00,719," Lol, thats what I'm afraid of!"
131274,OhioFisherman,2007-11-08 01:47:00,6623,"LOL great pictures! Walking that dock looks a lot like walking the plank to me. Options, radio heater, forget the radio? Two heaters!"
