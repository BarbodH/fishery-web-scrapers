129927,BFSC Kevin,2007-11-04 19:01:00,1351,"title says it all, i'm looking to get a gps/sonar, transom saver, a couple baits... on the site it said 3-7 business days. looking to get them and install before BOQ g2g.. thanks"
129928,Dondorfish,2007-11-04 19:06:00,1000,Most of my orders arrive in 4 or 5 days - sometimes even quicker - love that place!   Don
129930,fishindevil,2007-11-04 19:06:00,6254,"Hey kevin about 1 month ago i ordered some lures from cabelas,and i payed for just regular shipping and they sadi anywhere from 1 -3 weeks,maybe 4 and both times i had my package in under 2 weeks.  ..but that was just for a small package of lures maybe it depends on what you are ordering...???? i know that they are great to deal with and over the years i have always had great servicce ,and they have awesome service"
129932,Dondorfish,2007-11-04 19:09:00,1000,"Reading Fishindevils responce reminded me - they have express shipping - but I have never used it - no need, it comes fast enough for me!   Don"
129936,lew,2007-11-04 19:41:00,12767,I ordered a GPS from them last December and it arrived in 3 business days.....fabulous service.  You also get a tracking # so you can follow the progress of your order.
129941,BFSC Kevin,2007-11-04 20:02:00,1351,sounds good.. now debating if its worth getting the lowrance lcx-25c from them at $850 is a good enough deal to get  and use it a couple times before storage. Or there will be better deals?  thanks guys!
129943,irishfield,2007-11-04 20:14:00,26272,It may be the only place you'll find a -25c. I was told Cabellas and BPS bought every unit Lowrance could produce this year.
129944,lew,2007-11-04 20:17:00,12767,"Kevin, are you sure Cabellas even have those 25's anymore ??  Since I posted that link for the 1/2 price sale, they seemed to have removed them from the website, unless I'm just not looking in the right place, but I don't see them listed anymore."
129946,BFSC Kevin,2007-11-04 20:21:00,1351,hmm.. i'm looking right at it http://www.cabelas.com/cabelas/en/template...&hasJS=true that is it.. right?
129947,lew,2007-11-04 20:33:00,12767,"That's definetely the unit Kevin, but it's strange, I've gone to the Cabella website twice now and can't find that unit listed anymore.  I can see several LCX units, but not that one.  Anyways, go for it if you can, I've got a couple friends with that model and their all very happy with it."
129949,irishfield,2007-11-04 20:39:00,26272,"I put it in a ""cart"" and it says ""in stock"""
129960,Dondorfish,2007-11-04 21:07:00,1000,"Maybe they got another shipment in or found another crate of them "" out back ""   Don"
129961,Snypa,2007-11-04 21:13:00,25,"Cabelas is usually quite quick, ground delivery usually takes 1-2 weeks, air is about a week (in business days) or sometimes less.  Not sure if you'll have it in on time, but you should be able to track it."
129972,fishindevil,2007-11-04 21:37:00,6254,"yes kevin l had the option of sending my lures,express post it was more money i think $18 dollars but i didnt ,man you cant lose with them anyway,i sent you a PM ,about theose questions you had about the unit....man its an awesome unit for sure,and our dollar is high so jump all over that like a fat kid on a smartie..LOL..LOL"
130148,RHYBAK,2007-11-05 13:29:00,21,Their shipping is usually quick but I heard there is a backlog delay at the border with all of the e-bay and phone purchases that are being made recently with our rising dollar. Just another thing to consider.
130154,tonyb,2007-11-05 13:42:00,1637,"I've ordered 3 times from them this year and it has taken 6-8 business days each time, excellent service!"
130156,lew,2007-11-05 13:47:00,12767,"  Sorry if I caused any confusion for you Kevin, I just found that unit in the ""Bargain Bin""  Hope you enjoy it"
130158,pikehunter,2007-11-05 13:53:00,1659,I heard a similar story on the news the other day as RHYBAK had said.  I can remember the report was saying something about the favourable exchange rate has created an incredible increase in the amount of items being ordered and shipped from the States. This has caused slow delivery of parcels with some orders are backed up in the system for weeks!  If you have an order being shipped through Canada Post don't be too surprised if it doesn't arrive on the date expected.
130178,BFSC Kevin,2007-11-05 14:46:00,1351,no problem Lew!  yikes.. i really want it in time for BOQ though...  i guess i'll order it right now. hopefully it'll be here in time!
130179,danc,2007-11-05 14:47:00,4677,"Speaking of Cabelas, I just got an e mail from them announcing a sale in their ""Bargain Cave"". Click the link below and have a look through all of the categories. There's some really good deals in there, especially with the value of our $.  Bargain Cave"
130978,BFSC Kevin,2007-11-07 12:56:00,1351,"oh.. i called in this morning at 7,  my order should be here within the 7days since i am doing the international air. i sure hope he's right....."
