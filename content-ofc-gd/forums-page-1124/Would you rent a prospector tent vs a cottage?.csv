130422,Tarzan's Jane,2007-11-06 09:34:00,1183,"  Congratulations Wayne.  Yes I would rent this beauty for a week.  I would also consider the trailer as well,,,but I don't care for the cramped feeling I have in them.  After being the ""water girl"" on our wilderness camping trip, it really wasn't a big deal, but waking up cold in the morning sure was (normal tent).  I love that area in the fall...late September early October which means chilly nights...I can take a little less comforts ie no running water, no hydro...I personally like to feel that I have truly been camping. You definitely have some thinking to do but how exciting....impossible to appeal to everyone's taste...  Looking forward to the updates.  I would have no problem with spending $600.00 for the week to be at the water, in beautiful country, fishing and privacy....money well spent.  All the best."
130425,motv8tr,2007-11-06 10:14:00,2587,"Congrats Wayne, nice little slice of heaven you got yourself.  I'd love to grab  a little something like that, but I don't think the bank wants me to at the moment   Timing is everything  Maureen"
130429,bowshep,2007-11-06 11:07:00,378,Wayne... Nancy and l have not planed our trip next September yet so this is the time to strike... Chat up Nancy l picked the last one its her turn for the next one... Peace Ken
130461,Landlocked,2007-11-06 13:38:00,171,Great news Wayne!  I can't wait to see an amphib pull up in London....
130464,irishfield,2007-11-06 13:57:00,26272,Andy! You'll be pretty lonely there all by yourself when I kick you out of the plane...after taking your money!  We'll see where it goes from here...just faxed my paperwork to the lawyer.
130471,TJQ,2007-11-06 14:23:00,7806,"Ahhh   ...  i think ill chime in on this one...  finnaly got a min..  I have spent ALOT of time in prospectors tents, in the early days of my life, i spent many moons during all 4 seasons in prospectors tents.  for 3 years i practically lived in them (good and bad) while prospecting.   Ive spent beutiful summer nites and -40 nites in them.  And I can tell you this, your comfort is all dependant on how well the tent is put together.  If you keep them heated, they stay dry and you don't get that mildewy feeling.  Woods stoves are a MUST and I just picked up a small oil stove so i can keep a constant heat in the sleeping tent.  I did many fly in trips at all times of the year and we stayed in prospectors tents, wife kids and all.  Very comfortable and very happy.  The main reason I put a tent(s) up at Jiggy Jiggy was the cost and labour involved with getting the material into my remote location.    We truly enjoy the remote experience and being in the tent is part of ""ambiance"" of being in the bush to me.  I will say this though, if your in the tent, your likely paying for a fairly remote experience.    Privacy is a bit of an issue, although when we stay with people up there its generally people who know us and are used to a camping type experience which generally makes people less shy.  Is it a place for ""urban women"" who need the comforts of home to enjoy the outdoors... nope..    I heard stories from one pilot of women with thier husbands getting outta the plane seeing the tent... and turning around and getting back on the plane...  Is it a place for ""the boys"" to get away for a cheap weekend, certainly.  Theres a reason we call it camp and not the cottage....  Now as for the question... would I rent it... I sure would, but it it would have to be less than half the price of a nice cottage."
130514,irishfield,2007-11-06 16:06:00,26272,Thanks TJ for your experienced words of wisdom!
130545,ccmtcanada,2007-11-06 17:05:00,7971,So Wayne...is there a waiting list yet???
130552,irishfield,2007-11-06 17:16:00,26272,
130402,huntervasili,2007-11-06 03:53:00,1604,Nice congrats on the Purchase... Personally I think that at a somewhat discounted price... 70% or so of that of a cottage I would bite... I feel its enough of a discount to make it worth choosing the tent over the cottage... Fishing of course is the first consideration... but if thats alright I could see myself there in a heartbeat...
124444,Kirk,2007-10-17 19:29:00,347,"Welcome to the dark side Terry, after this first one the rest will be alot easier"
124172,irishfield,2007-10-17 00:42:00,26272,"With the permission of the mods I ask this simple question. If you were to consider a week or two vacation on Lake Temagami, where a 2 bdrm cottage rents from about $800 to $1000/week, would you consider renting a prospector tent like TJ has up at Camp Jiggy Jiggy (pic is his beauty get away spot).    First off would you rent such a structure and secondly what % of what a cottage rents for would you consider paying. Tent would have propane..stove/BBQ..fridge, a furnace possibly and lighting. On at least 7 acres of land that you'd have to yourself and a view to die for.    THANKS, Wayne"
124178,tomO,2007-10-17 00:57:00,363,you going to erect one and rent it out?
124179,irishfield,2007-10-17 00:59:00,26272,"I didn't ask that question...lol...just spinning my mind a bit at this point. Will know tomorrow, Thursday latest if I own ~4500 feet / 26 acres of Lake Temagami waterfront."
124180,tomO,2007-10-17 01:00:00,363,I can read your mind I think alot of people would go for that I would.
124187,Joey,2007-10-17 01:05:00,9122,"I definately would, and I would happily pay around $500 a week for it too.  Joey"
124188,Corey,2007-10-17 01:09:00,355,Ya... I would show up for an OFC GTG there.
124190,irishfield,2007-10-17 01:13:00,26272,Thanks Joey !! and Corey...lets not get ahead of ourselves ! LOL (but sure to happen sooner or later !!    )
124198,Terry,2007-10-17 01:25:00,14456,sooo is there room service satellite tv or high speed internet  but really I would do a weekend  in the tent but would go for a cottage if I was to spend a week there
124199,irishfield,2007-10-17 01:29:00,26272,"That's the kind of comments I'm lookin for Terry. Wanna see if it's worth the effort and expense. From what I've seen so far these ""camp jiggy jiggys"" aren't overly cheap."
124202,Roy,2007-10-17 01:35:00,13728,"My opinion. If the amenities are the same as a cottage, it's clean etc...it's worth as much as a cottage."
124203,irishfield,2007-10-17 01:40:00,26272,Thanks Bud!
124204,Joey,2007-10-17 01:42:00,9122,Cept for the bears can git at ya easier in the tent Roy
124206,Roy,2007-10-17 01:44:00,13728,"You'll be protecting me, Babymine."
124210,irishfield,2007-10-17 01:48:00,26272, Dang...we'll have an easy hook up...food barrel hangin gizzmo to appease the fraid - e- cats!
124211,silveradosheriff,2007-10-17 01:48:00,1025,I'd pay 600-750 primetime.
124212,Guest gbfisher,2007-10-17 01:48:00,0,Does it come with a fully rigged boat?..  ...lund maybe.   ..ya! ya! thats it!...A lund maybe!!!  Id rent one....Im not sure about the wife though. ah well....Thats OK..  . I dont mind fishing with out her..
124216,mikeh,2007-10-17 01:50:00,824,do they have water access for parking a boat?  also 7 acres gives people alot of privacy which I think they wouldn't mind paying for.
124219,KyleM,2007-10-17 01:55:00,218,"I would rent it for a weekend but as Terry said, any longer and I would want a cottage.  Wayne, if they arent cheap to put up....why not just build a cabin that size. Something more structural would be up all year long worry free!  If it were a tiny cabin it would be great for snowmobiler/icefisherman."
124220,irishfield,2007-10-17 01:56:00,26272,"Currently water access. If I get it I'll be jumpin thru OMB hoops for a few years to get building permits/serverances and there is the possiblity of a road across leased crown land to get to the property. I'm not banking on that one though considering there's not supposed to be any shoreline access, other than what's already there on Lake T. In the mean time they can't stop me from putting up platforms and tents. I'll of course have to install a few docks for boats...with easy access from the town site's free launch and parking. If I actually proceed I'd probably have to have some boats for rental as well."
124223,Roy,2007-10-17 01:59:00,13728,"A tent over a frame such as seen in the pic is as stable and dry/warm as a cottage.  (and much more romantic, Joey.)"
124229,danc,2007-10-17 02:14:00,4677,"As the realators say... location, location, location. I'd sleep on a bare rock if the fishing was good enough."
124232,Joey,2007-10-17 02:19:00,9122,"I have to agree Roy and Dan, I absolutely prefer the ambiance of a tent/bare rock compared to a cabin.  It just makes the ""outdoor"" experience more memorable in my opinion.  Joey"
124237,Riparian,2007-10-17 02:29:00,269," Oh man, I couldnt have said it better."
124240,Rizzo,2007-10-17 02:35:00,4754,"just make sure people are VERY clear as to what they are getting (ie photos of the exterior and interior)!  Some people would think a place like this is just perfect (OFC'ers) whereas others would be mortified.  People love to complain, make sure they are fully informed so that they have nothing to complain about (although we had one renter complain that there were  too many mosquitoes in the evening...go figure, heart of the muskokas and somebody wasn't prepared for the evening mosquitoe onslaught)"
124241,Cast-Away,2007-10-17 02:37:00,790,"Wayne, I camp alot and rent a cottage once a year and I have to agree with Terry. If I have a week, I want the creature comforts of a cottage, like a fridge, stove, running water, hydro etc. Especially if I a forking out coin. I rent a nice place on 12 Mile (you took pictures for me from your plane last year!) for $1000 per week. I pay $24 per day to camp at the Massasauga.  Warren"
