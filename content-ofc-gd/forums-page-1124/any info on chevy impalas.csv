I am just wondering if anyone here knows if impala`s are any good or if anyone here owns one. Any info would be much appriciated."
130221,ccmtcanada,2007-11-05 16:09:00,7971,"Go to Google and type in ""consumer review impala""...lots of info there to start reading....  Here's the first one I saw.... http://www.edmunds.com/chevrolet/impala/20...umerreview.html"
130234,lookinforwalleye,2007-11-05 17:13:00,4399,"Last winter I had to replace my company car in a hurry and I did the research on the Buick Allure and Impala and most of the reviews I read were positive especially on the Impala. One thing I would suggest if your not hung up on the it`s gotta be new thing is to look at a 2006 or 2007 low mileage used. As most people know GM vehicles for the most part have a lousy resale value especially in the first year or two thats the way I went and I saved 14K over a new vehicle.The vehicle I bought had 17,000 miles on it, to me that new car smell was not worth 14K."

130290,Burtess,2007-11-05 21:47:00,901,"I am in sales in and we get paid mileage and therefore buy our own cars.  I have always done well with Buicks.  My 2001 Century had 390K on it when I bought my LeSabre, and the only thing I had to replace was front wheel bearings, one coil spring broke, and the catalytic converter.  Brakes (every 90K) and oil changes don't count.  A few of my colleages drove Impalas.  The three with the standard cars with the 3.4L V6 had problems such as the intake manifold gasket, and other engine problems.  I have the 3.4L in my van and also did the gasket.  $30 part, $800 labour!!!!  The only one who didn't have problems was the one with the 3.8L V6.  I would suggest if you want an Impala to look for one with the 3800 Series II engine.  I will run forever....  Burt"
130307,lookinforwalleye,2007-11-05 22:23:00,4399,"The 3.4 is not an option on the Buick or the Impala the 3.8 is standard on the Buick and the 3.5 on the Impala, The 3.9 and 5.3 are also options on the Impala."
130309,rookiefisher,2007-11-05 22:42:00,5,"I have a 2006 monte carlo ss with a 5.3 ltr v8 this engine comes in the 06/07 impala ss great engine lots of power, I did own a 2003 monte ss with a 3.8 ltr v6 also a great car"
130311,Burtess,2007-11-05 22:46:00,901," My mistake, I misread, I thought he was looking for a used one, the 3.4L was standard on the Impala from 2000-2005.... You are correct, luckily the 3.4L was not available for the Buicks.  I have the 3.8L now and it is solid...  Burt"
130319,lookinforwalleye,2007-11-05 23:04:00,4399,And the best thing about the Impala is you can get a 2007 with low K`s for less than 18 grand!
130481,POLLIWOGG,2007-11-06 15:04:00,835,"I got a bud that buys off lease cars at the auctions and he likes the impalas.  The problem with gaskets is mixing parts that expand at different rates. As if aluminum on cast wasn't bad enough they went to plastic intakes, its getting to be something you can't avoid."
130482,Bassloadingzone,2007-11-06 15:10:00,32,"There is a reason the police force and the majority of taxis are Implalas, its because they are one of the most dependable cars out there, and I am a toyota guy"
131057,kennyman,2007-11-07 17:02:00,737,"Buick Allure (called Century previously), Chevy Impala, Buick Regal are basically the same chasis built in Oshawa and have been rivalling the Jap cars in ""initial quality"" etc. for a few years now. We bought a Century because they're great driving, reliable, reasonably priced cars."
131346,sharper,2007-11-08 04:37:00,279,Buy it used since they depreciate quickly.
