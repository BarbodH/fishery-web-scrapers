129690,SlowPoke,2007-11-04 01:47:00,2984,"A few folks have been mentioning ""isn't it time for another London swill?"" I have to agree. My yearning for a brontasauras burger may be affecting my judgement however.  Is it time for another swill or should we wait for 2008 and arrange something while the London Fishing Show is in town Feb 22-24 2008?  http://www.boatcottagefishingshow.com/main.htm"
130036,taper,2007-11-05 00:30:00,611,I am still working the graveyard shift but will try to make it whenever you schedule one. I would definitely make one during the London show thats on the weekend.
130039,Roy,2007-11-05 00:51:00,13728,"HEY!!! I know a great place where you guys can meet up! It's called Bernie's...can't miss it.  It's on Adelaide, just South of Oxford!"
130081,ChrisK,2007-11-05 02:14:00,2772,Soon as possible and then we can have another one after Christmass and then again during the fishing show.....
130114,Garyv,2007-11-05 03:37:00,547,Although I voted for between now and Christmas during the London Show would be as good.   Had a Brontie burger last July and I am hankering for another as I type. Unfortunately for me everything hinges on  ( again ) my health.  Going in this or next week to have them needle me and remove a liter or so fluid from my right lung ( I can't wait ) and sometime around the 26th an angiogram ( another thrilling day in my life ).  If all goes as planned and no bypass is required then bring on the burgers!!!!!!!!!!
130125,Woodsman,2007-11-05 07:46:00,1286,You missed one option on the poll: All of the above. One in 2-3 weeks seems like a good time.  Best Wishes: Rick

131010,JohnF,2007-11-07 14:38:00,3494," I shudder to think what a Bronty Burger might be, but since I might be in London for a few weeks then on a business gig, I'd be up for something. Even if I'm not working it's only 45 minutes to drive down. I'd like to meet some of the faces behind the posts here. Besides I'm new at this fishin' stuff and need some inside poop on Thames holes south of here.  JF"
