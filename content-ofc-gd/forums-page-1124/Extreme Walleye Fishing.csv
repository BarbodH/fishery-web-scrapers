This is not the image that I would like being distributed, nay, even promulgated, on this fine fine message board.  Lose this right away.  I don't think that OFC needs this kind of support."
129439,Roy,2007-11-02 23:04:00,13728,You're right Doug...it's certainly not one of our sponsors...it's a Google thing. I'll  cut them out.
129440,wuchikubo,2007-11-02 23:05:00,1114,douG was that a banner ad?  I haven't seen it (or noticed it yet) but I'm with you on the call. Table fare or fish fry is okay but not for the freezer! Kind of sounds like promoting poaching don't ya think?
129452,tributaryhunter,2007-11-02 23:43:00,108,"the add should be called, bag a freezer full of crape, and get ripped off"
129453,Gerritt,2007-11-02 23:49:00,6129,it is really weird you know... using the driftwood skin... I dont see these ads.
129464,douG,2007-11-03 00:41:00,2693,"Thx, Roy.  I swear the title of this post was the header on the ad in question.  I'd seen it before,  but didn't get THE RAGE!! that time.  UNTIL NOW.  Jeeze."
129467,Greencoachdog,2007-11-03 00:43:00,8163,It's still at the top of the page when i open this thread up.
129469,Shelley Cooper,2007-11-03 00:45:00,394,I still see it too Gcd...
129471,douG,2007-11-03 00:48:00,2693,"Does Glen have the sound turned on his PC?  Check chat, pls."
129476,Hooked,2007-11-03 01:02:00,891,"I keep shaking my head every-time I see that add, its whacked dawg."
129500,danc,2007-11-03 01:56:00,4677,"A ""freezer full"" of Walleye is a lot of fish. But it's also a figure of speech. Do you think that anyone on this planet actually goes there and expects to bring home a ""freezer full"" of fish? I wouldn't think so. And I can bet that it never has, nor ever will happen. It might be considered a bad choice of words in todays politically correct fishing world to a select few. But I'm not losing any sleep over this one. Let the ad stay where it is."
129503,Joey,2007-11-03 02:16:00,9122, Depends on how big the freezer is Dan  Joey
129504,danc,2007-11-03 02:19:00,4677," If it's as big as the one you're sittin' in Joey, then that's a lot of Walleyes. You picking Smoke this weekend???"
129509,Joey,2007-11-03 02:46:00,9122,"No, I thought I'd try Harvick this time, just for fun.  Smoke sucked last weekend.  I can only pick Johnson and Gordon a few more times too.  Joey"
130396,douG,2007-11-06 03:11:00,2693,Thump.
130400,douG,2007-11-06 03:19:00,2693,"A ''freezer full of walleye' is a figure of speech.  I understand that it is true that no one will actually go out and try to catch a ffow.  Substitute 'white bucket' for 'freezer' and what do you get?  Is there a difference?  I think there is, and I don't think the optics are good for your pov.  Please, rethink that banner.  ""Catch a White Bucket FULL of Walleye Every Time!"".  Still a figure of speech?  I'd rather someone take a pail full than a full 22 cu ft deep freeze, despite the offers of your sponsor.  I believe that this sort of blather harms what we have.  It also misdirects new Canadians in important ways, as we have seen north of Kingston with alleged poaching being interrupted by local folks.  Our job is to educate, and it is clear that we have some work to do.   Is it really only a 'select few' that feels like this?  Take it away,  please."
