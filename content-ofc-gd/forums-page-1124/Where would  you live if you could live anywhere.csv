130117,Garyv,2007-11-05 03:46:00,547,Guess like a few here I'm fortunate as I like where we live along the Southern end of Lake Huron as much now as I did when we moved here over 25 years ago.  I would like to perhaps try the Mountains in B.C. but age and health kind of kicks that off the plate.  In the North I like the Noelville and the Elk Lake area but with the family firmily entrenched around us I wouldn't want to miss watching the grandkids grow up so here we will stay for now.
130139,OhioFisherman,2007-11-05 13:01:00,6623,"Next door to Lew? at the cottage not T-town! Moving is a big issue, especially if you expect it to be your last move.  Big cities seem to be magnets for crime, and the taxes tend to be higher. Retirement issues, will you need to continue working? Family support network? Just to give an example, one of my buddies parents moved to South Carolina about 10 years ago, no family down there, illness forced them back. Family had trouble dropping everything and going down there to care for them.  The older you get the less mistakes you want to make moving."
130168,Beans,2007-11-05 14:27:00,3339,"Except for the wintertime, I live now where I wanted to be after retirement...somewhere I could be fishing in fifteen minutes...10 minutes outside of town (Bobcaygeon/Buckhorn) and a little more than half an hour to P'Boro or Lindsay...only real drawback is no family doctors...have to drive to Richmond Hill (2 hours) to see ours for check-ups etc.  Florida is nice as far as fishing is concerned but too damn hot...maybe Garry2rs has the best idea...Arizona !"
130173,rickster,2007-11-05 14:39:00,495,Right here in the city of EMO population 1200. 3 hours to winnipeg (though why go there????) 4 1/2 hours to t bay and a couple hours to numerous large pop. towns and cities in minnesota AND all the fishing and hunting you could ask for
130185,JohnF,2007-11-05 15:05:00,3494, A friend of mine moved there a few years back. Loves it. It does sound a tad pricey though.  JF
130192,tbayboy,2007-11-05 15:16:00,1497,Damnit Dan.  Now you've got me checking the thunder by job ads again .  I've lived in a few spots in southern ontario over the last decade and this year I've learned just how great the fishing down here can be but it just takes one summer day back in NW ontario to have me ready to pack it all up and move (I'll pretend to ignore the winters for now - you can pay guys to shovel snow I hear).  Sure I'll miss going to Jays and Raptors games but that's why god invented HDTV.   If I had a family and was looking for retirement then I'd be looking a bit further out of T Bay - Kenora would probably be high on the list for that point in my life but not quite ready for that level of isolation just yet.

Magdalena, Malta or Marsalforn, Gozo.... or if I realllly had the cash to spare .... a perhaps little villa in Mustique .... but really and truly for now at least ... right where we are now in our humble little place in Etobicoke just walking distance from both sets of parents - who we are blessed to still have with us -  and less than two hours from each of our kids who are experiencing their first few years away from the nest under the guise of continuing their education...the grass is always greener but having been there (and come back) I dont feel that I am missing out staying right where I am for a while more."
130438,Marc Thorpe,2007-11-06 12:14:00,621,Well I would live in one place Good Earth Hey I do live there
130465,Hookset,2007-11-06 14:02:00,367,"Couldn't be any happier living where I am now in Muskoka. There's definitely a trick to it tho'. Stay off Muskoka, Rosseau, Joseph etc. until the terrorists (see tourists) are gone. Shop in town only on weekdays and stay the hell outta town on weekends - easy to do if you fish.  We just bought a new home between Bracebridge and Huntsville and real estate is more than reasonable if you stay away from waterfront property.  I've got 15 bass lakes within 25 minutes drive, my fave is only 10 minutes away. No tourists ever hit these lakes and I usually have the whole lake to myself. Add thousands of acres of crown land in the area and I'm a happy camper.  2 hour drive to Murder City, oops I mean Toronto, to see family and distant friends ain't all that bad either.  Moved here from that area and I ain't never moving back. Hopefully I'll be long gone from this world before the G.T.A. gets too close.    Hookset."

130098,Mike the Pike,2007-11-05 02:46:00,3421, There is no Wall-Ice in Alabama and if there is its probably frozen and imported  I can only live where there is a fresh supply of Dore.

130102,Roy,2007-11-05 02:55:00,13728, I beg to differ. There most certainly is walleye in Alabama.
130103,Mike the Pike,2007-11-05 02:56:00,3421, There is Roy then how come the redneck never has a report with some nudity and Dore?????????????
130104,Roy,2007-11-05 03:01:00,13728,I guess you will have to ask him why he is not taking enough clothes off for you.
130110,scuro,2007-11-05 03:20:00,386,"I would pick Saltspring Island off of Vancouver island. It's big enough that it has decent shopping. Great summer climate and just a little less damp then Vancouver. If you miss the snow, head to Whistler. You are a short ferry ride away from awesome saltwater fishing and freshwater fishing. There is even decent fishing on the island. Just a very beautiful corner of this world.  Out east looks nice too. Perhaps some place central so you would be close enough to PEI, Newfoundland, Cape Breton and Southern Nova Scotia shore. What I have seen of Northern Quebec is also great.  If it had to be Ontario, then I would want to be above the hummid/smog belt which can extend to Sudbury/Northbay. The Nipigon area is awesome, Tamagami, and LOTW."
130113,Ron,2007-11-05 03:28:00,1683,"My home town Cobourg,  Everything is just a couple of hours away. I can go fishing for Walleyes in less than 15 minutes. I can go for trophy Walleye, trophy Pike, trophy Rainbow, trophy Muskie, trophy Salmon, trophy Perch and trophy Gar in less than 3 hours.  Oh ya, there is malls close by, and Super malls within 45 minutes as well.  Forgot to add, where else can you live and be able to fish ALL of Southern Ontario within 5 hours? Where else can you live where you can fish most of Central Ontario within 5 hours?"
129823,grt1,2007-11-04 14:17:00,638,"Currently we live in NW Ontario, just south of Red Lake. The wife wants to move to the city. Since we are both from southern Ontario (30 years ago) we know the area generally, but since changes occur over time, we know the area would probably not be recgnizable to us.  We are considering Winnipeg since it is close and has the shopping and entertainment the wife wants but it has become so violent in the past couple years and the car thefts are skyrocketing, i'm becoming leary of moving there even though it's close to great fishing.  Where  would the members of this board live if they could live anywhere. bearing in mind shopping facilities and entertainment and fishing availability?  Thanks for your opinions. Bill"
129826,ccmtcanada,2007-11-04 14:21:00,7971,"If I could find a good paying job in my field in the Kawarthas I'd be all over that.  Sure, the lakes can get busy in the summertime, but Peterborough is a pretty big town.  Oshawa is a short distance and you can get to Toronto in just a few hours.  Good luck!"
129828,irishfield,2007-11-04 14:23:00,26272,"There's a nice little strip mall on the North/West shoreline of St. Lucia !  Fishing is good...""entertainment"" is not bad to watch during the winter months.  ..and Yes what Cliff said, Peterborough is still a pretty quiet, nice clean city. Tripled in size since I was born there..but still a nice place."
129834,Mike the Pike,2007-11-04 14:31:00,3421,The wife and I have said that if we ever leave Quebec we would move to Kingston or Brockville Ontario.Much smaller populations than Montreal and Toronto.Yes after all those years the hussle and bussle of the big city is getting to me.Not far from the Bay of Quinte and the 1000 islands.

129838,John,2007-11-04 14:36:00,2956,"We all suffer the grass is greener syndrome. I think that you need to analyse why you are seeking to move and what it will accomplish. Pro's on one side of the sheet of paper and cons on the other side. Then you need to look at each entry and discuss each in detail. What you will find is that the list that you have made will dwindle down to a few ""real"" reasons.  If you then feel as strongly about relocation then you can look at it much clearer with actual goals in mind.  Cities do tend to have more crime Bill. It's the price most of us pay for ""shopping and entertainment"".  John...."

Having been here for 12 years I've come to appreciate London much more for its ammenities and have found it to be a nice place to live.  The downside, it's an hour and a half in any direction to find great fishing. The upside, it's an hour and a half in any direction to find great fishing.  I was spoiled having Lake Ontario salmon in my backyard when I lived in Oakville but living in London has opened the door to so many fishing opportunities An hour and a half gets you to... Lake Erie from many ports to follow the bows and eyes as the season progresses. Early season salmon on Lake Ontario's south shore and later around to the north shore. The Blue Water region in Sarnia, southern Lake Huron and St. Clair River. Lake St. Clair for perch, muskie and bass. Long Point Bay for perch, pike and bass. Lots of river systems for shore angling... the Maitland, Grand, Thames etc.  Great tackle shop in town - Lambeth Rod and Tackle. Don't tell Steve I sent you, he'll make fun of you. Hully Gully - ""The ultimate Toy Store""- boats, sleds and bikes. Heritage Marine - Boat repairs and storage.  London has terrific health care facilities. All the typical urban shopping attractions. A popular concert stopover for many big acts coming to the John Labatt Centre. OHL Hockey and NHL Exhibition games. Proximity to four international airports within 2 hours in Toronto, Detroit and Buffalo and our own London International Airport.  Very reasonable property values (same as paying rent on comparable listings) Reasonable property taxes. Lots of professional, industreal, retail and service oriented opportunities. Western University, Fanshaw Collage  It has a small town feel with all the big city ammenities. -Brian"
