130871,solopaddler,2007-11-07 01:52:00,8605," Actually bud, I've been fishing that place for 15 years now and have never heard it called ""the dump"" before, LOL! I did ""get it"" though, but it would be pretty easy for someone to assume that meant a trip to the local landfill site was in order  ."

131052,strakey,2007-11-07 16:48:00,78,Solo:  I was wondering where is a good place to go for browns as i have never caught one. I know that you'll never divulge your exact spot but where do you go. I live near the humber   
131086,FishFinder,2007-11-07 18:25:00,481," Humber is a great spot for browns, many times fishing for salmon i could not keep them off my hook. Dont forget your pitchfork"

131186,redx,2007-11-08 00:15:00,60,"Wow nice brown! I see a few hiding below the banks, very hard to get the fly drift to them. Tried every thing to get them bite. No luck yet. Maybe when there are more water."
131213,super dave,2007-11-08 00:44:00,323,"hey Mike any anyone else,  What do you guys do with the carcus?  I also take fish once a year for roe but I never know what to do with the remains.  I usually end up giving it someone that wants it so it doesn't go to waste.  Thanks"
131220,Mike the Pike,2007-11-08 00:49:00,3421,Roe Roe your B...........  WTG
131231,redx,2007-11-08 00:55:00,60," Same. What do you do with it? other then eating and giveing it to other? I have yet took a brown. (seen alot)  BTW> I was told that if the egg are lose you can kinda milk a small bit out and the trout will live. And then again few other people told me that is wrong and bit my head off saying that it will kill it, and I should (if eggs are needed take the fish alltogetter) keep it...  Can some one tell me what is right? I don't like to take a brown home, sorry I really don't like to kill or clean + eat them."
130674,solopaddler,2007-11-06 20:09:00,8605,"So yesterday I'm checking the freezer to see how my roe supply is and darned if I'm not running low. Wonder how that happened? I decided to make a suicide run to favourite spot for browns today...Worked 'till 6am this morning then left straight from the office with my gear in tow...I had to work fast as I had to be back in the office at 2pm for another 16 hour shift  . Anyhow I'm basically a zombie at the moment but mission accomplished. Tied into a bunch of hen browns as well as 1 bonus female coho. This is pretty much the only instance where I'll harvest these fish, once a year every fall.  Here's a few shots of the browns...     And the bonus coho...    And best of all...  Brown roe   And some very sweet bright orange coho roe   Look out steelies here I come!"
130675,ccmtcanada,2007-11-06 20:12:00,7971,Wow Mike...and you called me insane for fishing after our last excursion?? LOL.  Great job out there and some BEAUTY fish!  That's a nice supply of roe there....so when the BBQ???
130676,Roy,2007-11-06 20:14:00,13728,Wow! You did good Mike. That roe almost looks edible. :-) Don't be falling asleep on the job now.
130677,bassmaster4,2007-11-06 20:15:00,801,nice fish thats a lot of roe
130680,Spiel,2007-11-06 20:16:00,9065,"....Sweet, tie some up for me."
130683,Joey,2007-11-06 20:22:00,9122,"Wow, congrats Mike.  Did you take the skein off it or did you get liquid gold?  Joey"
130684,Cookslav,2007-11-06 20:25:00,1457,"Nice haul, I gotta get some Brownies yet.... I've had many a trip in the past were that brown roe is litteraly the only thing that works. Cheers,"
130686,Darek,2007-11-06 20:33:00,20,sounds like a trip to the dump is in order!
130688,skz,2007-11-06 20:36:00,15,
130689,fatherof3,2007-11-06 20:41:00,1769,"nice fish,congrats"
130696,solopaddler,2007-11-06 20:50:00,8605," This weekend at your place, LOL!"
130697,solopaddler,2007-11-06 20:52:00,8605, All fish were loose   .
130699,solopaddler,2007-11-06 20:53:00,8605," No problem bud, tie up a rod for me and you've got a deal!"
130702,solopaddler,2007-11-06 20:58:00,8605," A few years back I was tying up some roe bags at my desk when the office manager strolled in. I had a similar container of roe sitting up on the counter with an open box of Ritz crackers beside it, LOL! He thought the roe looked good too and before I caught on to what he was doing he had scooped up several big piles of it and wolfed it down  ."
130717,FinS,2007-11-06 21:29:00,463,nice fish Mike congrats save some for me lol
130722,fishindevil,2007-11-06 21:33:00,6254,"Nothing beats BROWN TROUT ROE !!!!!!!   man its the best,you are all set now for the rest of this year and for next spring,...youll be way ahead of the game!!!!.  ...nice looking fish as well as the pics...cheers"
130731,blaque,2007-11-06 21:49:00,2419,"That brown roe is crazy with the color variations from egg to egg. Ive been caught tyin up at my desk as well.....never gotten one to sample though lol. I mostly get Ewwwwws! hell i dont care anymore, i get suited up right at my desk now when im going to the streams from work. lol Waders and all. Oh and if the ""Dump"" you guys are referencing is Burt........be prepared for an even bigger slugfest there as theyve made some changes. Waders are no longer an advantage as anglers can access the creekside all the way to the tressle now with an added rockwall (party wall) Its empty here because i took this back in August i think. But trust me, it is elbow to elbow currently lol  "
130767,mattyk,2007-11-06 22:40:00,2110,"real nice, and i hear the steelies love the brown roe."
130778,Spiel,2007-11-06 22:54:00,9065,"  ....Ouch, I didn't see that one coming.  Best I think before begging....lol"
130787,Tarzan's Jane,2007-11-06 23:11:00,1183,  heheheheheheeee...did he come back for more?  lol  Browns sure are beautiful fish.
130846,highdrifter,2007-11-07 01:03:00,2534,AH right on.   All ya need now is some rice and sea weed and you got yourself some sashimi! mmmm yummmy!
130859,Darek,2007-11-07 01:28:00,20,  I don't get your post? The 'dump' is how many Ontarians refer to a certain brown trout location...
130861,floatfishin,2007-11-07 01:34:00,32,"BONK  Sweet haul there bro, well worth it when you got a pile of gold like that after an outing!!!!!  I got the Doughnut on my trip this past weekend, my fav lil gem Cr was still nil for water, but I do have enough eggies to last me, I pray till next fall  Got loose bow, got loose/skein shlam-o, but still in the hunt for the elusive brownie gold!!!  Awsome outing bro!  F.F"
130864,Moosebunk,2007-11-07 01:35:00,3970,Some great looking fish Mike.  I'd love to bag a first Ontario coho one of these days.  Can't believe you murdered them little preciouses.  Sin I tell ya.
130866,highdrifter,2007-11-07 01:36:00,2534, I see my error.  Sorry 'bout that.  Guess I'm a bit touchy tonight...
