131167,fishnsled,2007-11-07 23:28:00,3520,"If you plan on wearing it in the boat, make sure it meets the coast guard requirements.  Not all (if any) of the ice rider suits do.  I know that mine doesn't so I have to have lifejacket on board as well.  It keeps me warm enough, never been cold actually, and it will keep me a float.  I bought mine for sledding but do wear it fishing all the time.   edit - I'm wearing mine in my avatar."
131177,outdoorguy61,2007-11-07 23:45:00,220,"I am about to order a Salus Survival Suit (made in Kitchener). This will be my own little Christmas present, with some Bay of Quinte walleye on my agenda when I get home in December.  outdoorguy61"
131180,Mike the Pike,2007-11-07 23:54:00,3421,Yes Cliff that does sound like a great deal not to pass up.I have seen the ice rider suits they appear to be good quality.  I myself have the mustang Bomber Jacket which I find warm.No hood though.First time I went to the BOQ in November I had the bomber jacket with a good pair of snow pants every time I bent over I got the wind up my back. I purchased the mustang Integrity and I am very pleased with it .Just don't make the mistake I made and buy a YELLOW SUIT because many OFC ER'S have names for me in my suit lol  .All I wear underneath is a good pair of pants and a fleece pullover with a hood.  The hood alone is super warm.Oh and farting in a one piece is second to none warms up in an instant right out the back of your neck.  Save your money until next year Percher is lending you some suits so why don't you wait and buy what you need later.I can lend you the bomber jacket if you want.  Good luck on your purchase
131352,Badger Shark,2007-11-08 05:01:00,291,"I just bought a new Helly Hanson one piece but have not used it yet.  I figure I will give it a go if it is cold this Sunday.  I did have a two piece but found that the jacket rode up into my face everytime I would sit down.  It was convenient when I got warm  though, just to take the jacket off but I wanted the full suit because I am going to be on the water in Quinte almost every week until ice up and want to be safe.  If you are planning on being out in your boat for the fall, I dont see why you cant wear those if you have life jackets.  Especially for that price, why not? Save yourself some cash."
131364,nofrills,2007-11-08 07:57:00,89," Raf (I think)  My HH suit is approved. I had a picture of the inside of teh suit, but can't seem to find it. Anyways, I'm not sure whether they all are, but mine is. Honestly, I would probably bring my life jacket with me anyways on a boat."
131378,brickNblock,2007-11-08 12:02:00,598,"Cliff.....ask for Johnny atTightlines in Pickering. I bought my 1pce nautilus ther about 2 years ago for $ 175. I think they were, $225 everywhere else. goodluck....pete"
131467,JohnF,2007-11-08 14:45:00,3494," Well, she told me she was kinda flirty, but ......  JF"
131111,Hookset,2007-11-07 20:04:00,367,"I have the 2 pc. Mustang Ice Rider set.  Great for inside a portable hut, usually just wear a sweater and take the coat off. I also find that most times even outside I'm running around without the coat, just the pants and a good sweater. The bib pants come up your back pretty far and the front bib is tall too. A one piece would be better for those who brave the outside when it's 30 below but I hide in the little hut when it gets like that. Woosie....   Hookset.  P.S. that's a hell of a good price you got for both."
131115,John,2007-11-07 20:20:00,2956,"Hi Cliff,  I have a two piece Mustang and I like the flexibility of the jacket and pants (bib style) being separate. The downside that might get me to convert to a one piece is the lack of a hood. When the wind blows a hood is real nice! Quite often I find it too warm. Look at the ice fishermen, in many cases they will be sitting with the top half of a one piece rolled down around their waist. If you can do without the hood sounds like a deal to me."
131117,LeXXington,2007-11-07 20:31:00,1928,Thats a GREAT price but for boating not the best but It would do.  The base 1 peice suit should be about 299.00 the upgade ones are a little more.  I would go for the one peice if you hate the cold
131120,Minnow,2007-11-07 20:35:00,177,"I don't know about 2 piece suits but I own a Helly Hansen 1 piece suit that I find is amazing, very warm and I like it even better then some of the mustang suits I have tried on. I got it at Lebaron for $264 I believe and I love the suit and I do a lot of ice fishing! My Helly Hansen is VERY WARM, is a Bright Orange all around VERY VISIBLE, Has a whistle, reflective stripes, a hood for those really windy days, and even suspenders to hold up the suit when I want to take the top part off when its too hot! Great Floater Suit and I recommend it!  Here is the link and it lists all the features, http://www.lebaron.ca/pdf_fall_07/clothing...nsen_lectra.pdf  "
131122,nofrills,2007-11-07 20:38:00,89,"  Lexxington, you should remember this shot! Love my HH suit!"
131123,Raf,2007-11-07 20:41:00,3495,"are the helly hansens coast guard approved now?  i don't think they were for a while.  the suspenders are a nice feature on the 1pc.  i wish my mustang had them.  whichever way you do decide to go, go for one size larger to leave room underneath for layering up in cold weather."
131124,JohnF,2007-11-07 20:46:00,3494," I agree on the flexibility part, particularly if Cliff & Bly want these primarily for boating. I suspect they're gonna be going sans pants a lot of the time.  Two other points. I've seen separate windproof hoods that can be used with a balaclava if it's really nasty out. Give some thought to the wicking type of undergarment so the sweat that occurs, as it inevitably will with warm gear, is kept off your skin. If a cold breeze sneaks inside when your skin is wet it can get very uncomfortable very fast. There's also the shock when you finally take off yer jacket in a brisk spring/fall breeze.  In fairness to those who say a one piece is warmer - it's just remotely possible there have been improvements since I bought my last one piece snowsuit in about 1975.  JF"
131125,Headhunter,2007-11-07 20:48:00,5703,"Hey CLiff, check out the link... may not be exactly what your looking for, but the price seems pretty good!  http://www.cabelas.com/cabelas/en/common/s...ueNum=3&N=0 HH"
131131,John,2007-11-07 21:03:00,2956," Hey John,  Maybe Cliff and Bly like going without pants........."
131136,Cookslav,2007-11-07 21:06:00,1457," Your crazy if you don't grab that deal... Infact if you decide against it...please PM me  I Prefer the 2 Piece...Its way more comfortable to me but thats personal prefferance. The single suits can tend to be to warm on accasion, and feel a bit bulky to me?  They will both keep you a float and save your life if you go through the Ice, or fall in the water. Most 2 peices are Actualy more expensive then the singles....not sure why that is but, they are?  Like I said if you turn the deal down, shoot me a PM Bud."
131141,PERCHER,2007-11-07 21:16:00,787,Go one piece.If you are buying it for saftey as well as warmth then the one piece is the way to go.There is a reason why the Coast Guard wear one piece suits.If you look around you can still find some Natilus suits for sale.I think that Fishing world still carries them.I have Natilus 1000 series that I bought for 299.00 and its a great suit.It also has the suspenders wich is a great feature.Just shop around.
131146,motv8tr,2007-11-07 21:26:00,2587,"I bought my Nautilus one piece a couple of years ago at the spring fishing show...think I paid  99.00 for it.  I like it except it's made for people with LOOONNNG legs  , and mine aren't that long.  It's a small and I'm still looking for a belt to hold them up.  Other than that I like it.  That being said, I also wouldn't mind a jacket on it's own for days not so cold.  Maureen"
131156,ccmtcanada,2007-11-07 22:26:00,7971,"Thanks everyone...wow...lots of great responses here!  Truth is, I may ice fish 2 times this winter....this is more for fall fishing in our boat, where we will always have life jackets aboard and accessible.  In order to outfit the both of us, we're looking at around $600.  That's a more than we can swing right now.  I figure if these will do for those days when it's -5C, then it'll be ideal for us.  Hmmm...decisions decisions....LOL."
131158,ecmilley,2007-11-07 22:30:00,2163,"well i have both Cliff, the one piece is warmer but it is a bit bulky, and does limit your mobility a bit it is only better for a fall through the ice if all your saftey straps (arms, waist legs) are cinched up. my 2 piece doesn;t have a hood but I am usually riding with a helmet I don't get cold in either, good boots, gloves and misty mountain underwear go a long way to keeping you warm, My biggest problem with the one peice suits (at least the buoy o buoy ) was trying to take a leak you near had to strip the suit right off it has a big wind flap positioned in the bottom of the zipper, but it also has a hood for those windy days, cvan't really go wrong with either suit, it'll save your life when it has too"
