130644,Bassloadingzone,2007-11-06 19:10:00,32,Those pictures and the out come look just like fishing on scugog
130648,Entropy,2007-11-06 19:13:00,747,  LOL    Ya I guess So !
130649,Jen,2007-11-06 19:14:00,833,"Those pictures are exactly why I feel the way I do about both fishing and Hunting... The beauty of what is around us everyday gets missed when our lives are hectic... You captured a beautiful memory.  Too bad about the lack of geese but then there is lots of time left in the season for a couple I am sure.  Cheers,  Jen"
130821,Entropy,2007-11-07 00:11:00,747,"Yep Jen, we all need to enjoy (somehow) what we have/do on a day to day basis.  Entropy"
130858,Gerritt,2007-11-07 01:27:00,6129,I see it as a lack of meat... nice pictures though! being out there is 90% of the experience.
