131018,ccmtcanada,2007-11-07 14:57:00,7971, Never thought I'd see the day when I read something like that....LOL.  The dollar is rising too quickly for my comfort....5 cents in the last 3 days!

131184,Crazyhook,2007-11-08 00:08:00,1154,  I have read it will hit 1.15...  I would think better to invest in US companies as you would make money on the exchange if the dollar goes down and also on the performance of the company just my 2 cents
