131104,Kirk,2007-11-07 19:36:00,347,"Nice deer.  These threads always have 2-3 idiots...they are probably the same people that rent pornos and then write complaint letters.  If ya don't like it, theres billions of other pages on the internet you could look at."
131109,Canuck2fan,2007-11-07 19:51:00,1444,"I almost got me a deer this morning ala bumper tag..... So close because some idjit was so close to my back bumper I wasn't going to brake for the deer. It was my work van anyhow. The darn fool was so close behind me that I couldn't see his headlights in the rearview mirror but I could see he had two young kids in the car otherwise it would have been brake check time long before that. Anyhow after the deer hopped out in front of us and I drove around it more or less I thought the guy behind might smarten up. NOPE!!!! Instead of backing off or slowing down what does this clown behind me do. Pulls out his cell phone and starts making a call, probably to his hunting buds to tell he saw one LOL.... If only I had of had the time to follow him and talk to him about his stupidity of driving like that with kids in the car..... I hope them young ones don't pay for the price his dumbness."
131171,Spiel,2007-11-07 23:38:00,9065,"....Congrats to your dad, I can well imagine the adrenaline rush as he patiently held is draw till the right moment. Sounds like he a good clean kill to me. Enjoy the rewards of the harvest. I know I would and do when my hunting buddies bestow upon me a nice feed of wild game....yummy!  As for the ""fishing board"" comment well I'll post an excerpt from the rules (has anybody read them?).  ""If your post contains hunting images that may offend some, please note Hunting Images in your post description."""
130186,Jay T,2007-11-05 15:05:00,282,"Well we managed to get our first deer down after passing on a lot of deer, but it is time to get some meat in the freezer. Not a big rack but nice body. My Dad and Bro left work early Friday to get out in the bush, they were all set up for 3:30 not long after that my dad spotted a nice doe feeding towards him, but he knew there would be a buck trailing her and sure enough after a couple of buck grunts he showed himself. They both fed towards him slowly, then the doe stopped about 20yrs away the buck kept coming to the scent bombs he placed out infront of him about 15 yrds away, did the loop around and came infront of him at 3 yrds. He looked up and thought he was busted but with good back drop didn't have a clue he was going to get stuck with an arrow, turned slightly quartering away and he let the arrow fly. Perfect shot lung and heart he didn't go more than 40 yrds and piled up. Here is a few pics. Hopefully more to come but is shut down for bow for the week due to shotgun season started today.  "
130197,ccmtcanada,2007-11-05 15:20:00,7971, Where else can you say that and NOT get slapped?? LOL.  Great report....and congrats!
130247,fishindevil,2007-11-05 17:33:00,6254,"Mmmmmmm....YUMMYyyyyyyyyyyy....Venison steakes & sausage.  ..so what time is dinner?????  great shootin,hope the rest of the season is good for you as well...cheers & good-luck well done"
130248,TJQ,2007-11-05 17:35:00,7806, hahahahahaa...  nice deer .. congrats!
130257,Jay T,2007-11-05 18:13:00,282,"Thanks guy's. 4 more tags to fill so we got some work to do, but if it don't work out with the bow we have shotgun/muzzleloader season in December and there will be more brown down. Shoot em straight  Jay"
130259,oldphart,2007-11-05 18:19:00,665," ~~~move over fishindevil I'm fisrt at the table, you don't even know how to spell your name right(phishendevil) I'll take a little off the left shoulder please, and someone pass the wild mushrooms, there are some mushroom ????"
130261,redx,2007-11-05 18:23:00,60,Just wondering how I would start hunting? I got the time table for the hunting + gun lisence from bass pro shop. And will take the corse asap. But I'm wondering how some one with no family hunting exp get into it? is there a hunting club?  Didn't mean to hyject the topic. I didn't want to make a new post and this seem like a good idea to ask.
130296,Blue_Axela,2007-11-05 21:57:00,88,"I don't understand the merit in posting pictures of dead and blood soaked deers and moose hanging upside down.  I mean its not the same as posting a fish meal...its a little more ""graphic"".  Then again I don't hunt nor plan to."
130297,fishermccann,2007-11-05 22:05:00,655,"If you don't hunt or don't plan to, then you cannot understand. No comment is needed ,Thank-you!!!!"
130299,danbo,2007-11-05 22:10:00,2646,Atta boy!
130312,skz,2007-11-05 22:46:00,15,"congrats, you just killed bambi"
130314,steve_paul,2007-11-05 22:55:00,658,"Nice job Jay  I think he was fairly clear in his title of the post what to expect if you opened it btw - again, if you don't think you'll like it - don't open it.  Pretty simple."
130316,Burtess,2007-11-05 22:56:00,901," I do not hunt, nor do I plan to, but I do understand.  Some of my friends hunt, and I always enjoy their hunting stories, and the odd cut of wild game.  Good for Outdoorsman at getting one, and next time take your camera on the hunting trip with you and get a shot where you took it down as well.   Whaaaaa.....  Burt"
130348,Riparian,2007-11-06 00:23:00,269, You are reading a hunting and fishing message board. Please do not search for such things if they upset you.  They manner in which the deer was killed is no less graphic than the same manner fish are for the table. Its just easier for you to stomach.  Nice deer outdoorsman.
130383,skz,2007-11-06 02:03:00,15, Actually this is a fishing board. 
130384,Gerritt,2007-11-06 02:11:00,6129,"  I see this board as an appetizer... to food... be it fish, venison, moose (meese? LOL) Beef, pork, bird... I dont care... the premise of this board is MEAT....  Mmmm and such fun tasty MEAT it is.... All finished off with a nice rich red wine... Or perhaps a nice dry white..?  Burp.  Gerritt."
130392,Rooky,2007-11-06 02:46:00,11,"Congratulations,  I got this one this morning and the group has 4 all together, not bad for the first day of shotgun!  "
130404,redx,2007-11-06 04:05:00,60,"a Doe! a deer~ a female deer~!  nice pic~!  Sorry for some odd reason that is stuck in my mind as I see this, even if it is not a doe... It must be sound of music thingy..."
130443,Jay T,2007-11-06 12:43:00,282,"  Wow, I thought I was quite clear when I posted this! Do you eat meat? Or wait let me guess you buy meat from the store and forget about what also happened to that animal for it to end up on your plate I just have the nads to do it all myself from start to finish, I have nothing but respect for animals and the way they are harvested, clean and quick. I am proud to be a hunter and a fisherman I love what I do and NO one will ever tell me any different. It is people like you that burn me, that they can be so negative towards hunting, but go and buy a big T-bone and put that on the BBQ but that is OK with you. I think you are a hypocrite   and should use some common sense before you post negative comments about other peoples posts.   Rooky, congrats on the doe.   And thanks to everyone else that had nice things to say."
130444,Gerritt,2007-11-06 12:46:00,6129,"Outdoorsman, Well said.  Gerritt."
130491,blowes,2007-11-06 15:25:00,16,"The boys,(misfish and medmart) are out there right now. 2 sightings but no safe shot.Weather temps too warm,rain and more rain up here.  Congrats  on the buck and on that doe."
130492,Fishnfiend,2007-11-06 15:26:00,357,"Congratulations!  As suggested, try and take a picture in the field/woods, too.  I understand that this deer isn't a wall hanger, but if you make it a habit of taking pictures/posing the deer, you will be able to get the 'perfect' picture when you do harvest the deer of a lifetime.  I haven't got one yet this year.  I hope I don't end up with 2 servings of tag soup!"
130744,dsn,2007-11-06 22:12:00,1018, Yeah I'd love to see an action shot of the arrow flying and the deer infront. LOL
130765,Daplumma,2007-11-06 22:37:00,1961,"Nice deer,love to see the pics.Muzzle loader opened last Saturday and my buddy got one in my woodlot.I haven't got out yet but its getting cold enough to feel like hunting! Joe"
130851,oxcowboy,2007-11-07 01:13:00,544,"good shootin man,  there is nothing better than that first fresh steak, or first batch of jerky for the year.  i for one am glad to see when someone on this board gets a nice deer or moose, or anything else they are proud of.  good luck on the rest of the season, keep us informed.  jason"
