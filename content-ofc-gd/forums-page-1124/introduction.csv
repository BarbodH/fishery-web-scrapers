I finally got my own digital camera yesterday so I decided to join and start contributing. I fish for all species of fish that are availible to me, but try to focus mostly on musky and bass.  I am not very good with computors and I can't figure out how to upload a picture to use as my personal image. If someone can help me out I would really appreciate it."

Select avitar settings.  hit the brouse button and it will pick a pic right from your computer, no hosting needed.  Once you pic what you want hit upload, that's it.  Same with the pictures.  Except that is right below where you post.  Just make sure you follow the rules and resize your photos to the required specs."
