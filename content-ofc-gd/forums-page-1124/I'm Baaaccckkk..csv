Lots of reading ahead for me  I haven't been on the site because I had to cancel internet because we were moving soon and I only just recently got it back up and running, Saturday.  Well the big day finally came, October 11 2007. That is when we took possesion of our new house   . We did our big move on the 20th and we had a house warming party on the following Saturday. Who knew that buying a new house would be so much work. This is my first free night so I decieded to check out the fishing community and see if everyone is still catching fish. And by the looks of things everyone still is  Well, I'm going to keep it short for now and I hope that everyone keeps on catching the fish.  Bye for now."
