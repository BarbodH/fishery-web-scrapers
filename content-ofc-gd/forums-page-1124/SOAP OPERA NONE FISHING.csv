130872,BITEME,2007-11-07 01:55:00,1969,So once again i fell into a bucket of sheet and smell like a rose  About 15 years ago I was asked to drive a 5 ton truck to Smithfalls and clear out a cottage owned by my father in laws uncle. any way deal was anything I wanted i could have as long as it fit in the truck with what he wanted. long stary short i made off like a bandit a boat motor and trailer bed furniture all kinds of stuff. Well tucked up inside the bow ofthe boat was a heavy object wrapped in a mechanics rag i opened it up to find a lion hood ornament signed by a CBRAU in the back of my mind I thought it was unique anyway its ended up in alot of places over the years and finnally i stored it in a box and the last time i seen it was 7 years ago well i was cleaning the crawl space and there it was in a box. now i had tried to find out about this before with no luck internet was still a baby. so today i find some interesting info Ill let the link speak for itself. it was about to become the head of a walking stick it was even going on the front of the boat at one time  http://www.antiques.dk.com/detail.php/Deco...20Deco/10422755  this particular one i have is immaculate and as shiny as the day it was done you can even see the shaping marks under the silvering. well thats my story or Soap Opera for the day Im going to be building a family room

130911,Nemo,2007-11-07 03:28:00,727,"Looks like he collected other things if this is your man. Very interesting.  http://digital.library.mcgill.ca/pugsley/pugintro.htm  But this is so NF it's boring. Great mystery for a cold night...  The Map Collection The Map Collection in the Department of Rare Books and Special Collections contains over 6,000 historical maps, dating from 1556 to the 1940s. The major strengths of the collection are the discovery and exploration of North America, works by sixteenth century European cartographers (i.e. Hondius, Ortelius and Speed), and Canadian and Montreal maps from the nineteenth and twentieth Century.  The Pugsley Maps  In 1971-72 Dr. William Howard Pugsley, a McGill alumnus, donated a collection of 50 early Canadian maps, dating from 1556 to 1857, to the McGill University Libraries. Dr. Pugsley collected these maps during the late 1930s, and World War II, principally in England. Now housed in the Department of Rare Books and Special Collections in the McLennan Library, this set of maps tells the story of the discovery and exploration of North America. The oldest map in the Pugsley collection is from Ramusio's Delle navigationi et Viaggi, vol. 3, 1556, the first book published to present a detailed account of North America.  William Howard Pugsley, 1912-1993  William Howard Pugsley was born in Montreal in 1912. He attended Ashbury College in Ottawa, from which he graduated in 1929. He spent the next year at the Sorbonne in Paris, and then attended McGill University, graduating with a B.Com. (Honours) in 1934. In 1936, he received an M.B.A. (with High Distinction) from Harvard Business School and in 1950, a Ph.D. in Economics from McGill. During World War II, Pugsley was a Lieutenant in the Canadian Navy, but resigned his commission to write a book about the Lower Deck: Saints devils and ordinary seamen (Toronto: Collins, 1945). After the War, he spent several summers with the fleet and published another book about the life of a sailor in the Canadian Navy: Sailor Remember (Toronto: Collins, 1948). Then a third book about the Navy was written: Return to the sea: Lower Deck of the Canadian Navy revisited eleven years after the 1945 demobilization (Don Mills: Collins, 1960). From 1954 to 1981, Professor Pugsley taught in the School of Commerce, McGill University, later the Faculty of Management. In 1981, he was the producer of McGill's Red and White Revue. William Pugsley died in Ottawa in 1993."
