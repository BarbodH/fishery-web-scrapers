We started off by drifting some singles nothing too exciting happening just a few 1lb egg suckers and Dan gets crushed out of the blue. Fish takes off like a bullet and sticks to the bottom of the hole. After a few mins a large Laker surprise us. Just after getting a peak the hook comes out, out well quick release!. Getting sick of the we guys we moved on to a new river. nothing, tons of ppl no fish. It was getting late in the afternoon, we moved to another river hoping that the usual crowd had moved out in mid afternoon. After about 15 min of pitchin spoons I got crushed a nice 5 min battle insued. I guessing around 7-8lbs quick pic and back he goes. not a bad day but we worked for em. lol  "
