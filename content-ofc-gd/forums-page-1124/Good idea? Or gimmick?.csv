131211,danc,2007-11-08 00:43:00,4677,Here's the latest. It's a translucent net. It's invisible under water. What do you think guys? Are you running out and buying one tomorrow?  Invisible Net
131214,redx,2007-11-08 00:47:00,60,"I won't mine a net like that. Then again I'm to lazy to carry a net... so, nvm.  Would be neat to know if that net will make a difference in spooking the fish or not."
131218,Gerritt,2007-11-08 00:48:00,6129,"""This is our new state of the art net bag""  I can picture it now... they are tripping over each others bag's cause they're invisible!  and they say I stir the pot from time to time LOL  Great post!!  G."
131221,Muskieman,2007-11-08 00:49:00,2472,"Good Idea?  maybe    .... Gimmick ?  << ... I think so.  I wonder if they actually studied this or just marketed the net?  Probably had left-over '' Jelly Shoes "" melted them down and made nets out of them..  Might work better in clear water...who knows ..screw it !  I'm ordering one!"
131222,Milty,2007-11-08 00:50:00,121,"I dont want to catch any trout that would fit in that net...lol,..well maybe a few small residents in the summer,...otherwise,..unless your fishing on top of a peir,...no net required...on the river that is...."
131225,danc,2007-11-08 00:53:00,4677," Well we don't all catch them as big as you do Uncle. Our Brookies only top out at about 24""."
131229,huntervasili,2007-11-08 00:54:00,1604,Nice lookin net... but i dunno about the spooking fish deal... wading around will spook em looks like its of good quality though
131237,Milty,2007-11-08 01:00:00,121,"  Just a joke Dan,...Beleive me i would take some of those nice brookies you guys get up there anytime i get the chance..and I do know how big they get too,...down here we gotta settle for what we have,..Steelies,..noone on the river really uses a net for them,...after all how do u get a 24-30"" fish in that net without hurting it?,..;theres no need really!!!"
131240,Roy,2007-11-08 01:07:00,13728,There's something I don't understand here. Let me get this straight. You have a brookie on your line. It has a #6 hook in the mouth and is fighting for its life. Now you want to use an invisible net so as not to 'spook' it??? Splain please.
131245,danc,2007-11-08 01:11:00,4677, LOL.... I agree Roy. I just thought I'd throw this out there for some reaction.
131248,Fisherman,2007-11-08 01:17:00,7201,"Ha, that's a good one, run right out there and buy one with some invisible money."
131249,Milty,2007-11-08 01:19:00,121,"  Actually on the river,...a net will spook steelhead once it gets close after the main fight...and many times this will be the 'breakoff/self-release point',...I thought that was well known...is it different with specks on the lake?"
131252,redx,2007-11-08 01:23:00,60," Not just with a steels few other fish will see the net and will give a good run. If the fish didn't care for the net we woundn't care if the net guy tried to net the tail 1st.  Edit: but I'm sure if the fish would be spooked by the net, it would be spooked by the guy with the net too..."
131254,Deano,2007-11-08 01:26:00,767,"What are the Most Relaxing Colors? blues and greens make us feel calm, balanced, and less emotional.  Hey Roy, maybe the net should be blue or green to calm the fish down. LOL  Some people will buy it, I'm just not one of them, besides you can still see the frame."
131256,Milty,2007-11-08 01:28:00,121," Many ways to land a steelie without hurting it or spookin it too much,..just gotta plan in advance!!!"
131304,John Bacon,2007-11-08 02:41:00,3277,   No to mention that the hoop that holds the mesh will still be visable in the water.
131326,bigfish1965,2007-11-08 03:40:00,3382,Here's a picture of the invisible net I bought...           .
131328,FishFinder,2007-11-08 03:42:00,481,"Rick, try Photobucket, its fast, easy and free."
131382,Rich,2007-11-08 12:17:00,3927,"I might be overlooking the obvious, but wouldn't the handle still be clearly visible as it dangles into the water from your waders?"
131386,ccmtcanada,2007-11-08 12:21:00,7971,LOL Rick...send me one in the mail would ya?  Or did you do that already and I just haven't found it yet?
131387,Spiel,2007-11-08 12:22:00,9065,"....Gimmick, I mean really who waits for the fish to swim into their net? I lead mine into the net when the time is right, I don't give them a choice."
