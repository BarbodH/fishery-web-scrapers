45152,Victor,2007-03-09 21:46:00,1609,"I can't believe it's been almost half a year since i've had a fish on my line ... was in residence (sept-dec) so i missed out on the fall fishing ... on top of that all my hooks are too big for the fish in my fish tank    ...  There's going to be light rain tonight and apparently it's 30km/h SW winds tomorrow according to the weather network. I'm still new to steelheading so i'm just wondering if it's a good idea to head out or if it's ""fish-able"" tomorrow.  Any help is appreciated and if you don't want to disclose the information here please PM me. Thanks!  If it's a no-go i guess i'll spend my day at basspro ...  Victor"
45155,canadian_copper,2007-03-09 21:48:00,925,hit bass pro bro!!! the south winds have really stirred the lake up at the mouths !!!! plus with rain and warm temps all the creeks are gonna blow sky high and be very dangerous for atleast 4-5 days!!!
45163,Victor,2007-03-09 22:06:00,1609,Thanks CC! You'd know best since you're out there almost everyday.  Earlier today i was just thinking ... hope that CC didn't go to the trib that i'm planning to hit so i'll still have a chance
45164,canadian_copper,2007-03-09 22:08:00,925,lol no fishin for me for atleast the next 4-5 days!!!! gonna be lots of run off!!!
45169,MJL,2007-03-09 22:18:00,2427,Vic you can always go to the Mandarin buffet in Markham and have a go at their koi.  The water remains ice free and the fish are a decent size.  Test out your new gear while you dine on crab legs.
45176,Victor,2007-03-09 22:23:00,1609,"Great idea!  I don't remember seeing ""no-fishing"" signs the last time i was there  Even though i won't get a new PB i can catch my first Koi."

45358,kemper,2007-03-10 06:19:00,2232,blown. dangerous. do not venture out because I dont want my tax dollars being used to pluck you from an ice flow in the middle of lake ontario.
