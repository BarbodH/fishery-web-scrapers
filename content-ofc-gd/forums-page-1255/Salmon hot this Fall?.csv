45323,xrap,2007-03-10 03:40:00,683,"The more salmon the more snaggers. I hope the shallow creeks are blown during the whole salmon run. For example Bronte is gonna be loaded with snaggers waiting at every rapid  with 50lb test and a treble hook at the end. That place is brutal and is a total slaughter fest every year. People fishing from the sancutary, and if you told them they weren't aloud they would just say no english. Calling the cops wasn't much of a help because they never showed up. It is a complete mess down thier with gutted fish laying around everywhere and all the garbage. Maybe they should close Petro park down for the salmon run."
