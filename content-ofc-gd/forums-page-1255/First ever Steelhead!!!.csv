45392,b2kptbo,2007-03-10 13:32:00,1505,"All are nice fish and congrat on your PB, great report..."
45396,Doctrt,2007-03-10 14:00:00,141,"Nice report Bly, but I will warn you - steelheading is one tough addiction to shake! Congrats, and welcome to the club! Tim"
45406,Bly,2007-03-10 15:07:00,1556," Thanks Tim!   Love getting the chance to target a new species and learn, especially when you can fish with someone like CC  .   Do you find it as addicting as Musky fishing??  Bly"
45409,Bernie,2007-03-10 15:14:00,3190,Way to go Bly  Glad to see you and CC did well. Hope when we get out at Lakair with you and Cliff we can do the same.
45421,Doctrt,2007-03-10 16:20:00,141,"Hey Bly,  You know what, steel and muskie are very similar in many respects, yet very different in others.  They are my two favorite species to target, likely because they are the two most difficult species to master (imho).  The difference is that with muskie, the difficulties lie in the hunt (that part is most difficult).  If you're geared up properly, you should be able to land them.  With steelhead, while the hunt is fun, you generally know when they are there.  The real thrill for me and many others is watching the float go down, and the fight that ensues.  When you're geared up lightly, often times you sacrifice strength for stealth, and as a result you may hook more but you'll also lose more.  Nonetheless they are both great fish.  It's probably a good thing the bows don't run in the summer or I would have a real dilemma! Take care, Tim"
45451,mattyk,2007-03-10 18:09:00,2110,nice!
45150,Bly,2007-03-09 21:39:00,1556,"Well, CC was nice enough to take me fishing for steelies this morning.  I stopped by his place at 5:20am and picked up CC and Little C and headed straight for Tim Hortons.  After fueling up with coffee we hit the road.  We arrived before sun up....the spot being empty, so that was nice…even though that didn’t last very long.  It was a chilly -11C (-17C with the wind chill) and the water was pretty murky, but it’s been like that for a few days now and you’ve seen CC’s reports from earlier this week!  Little C had a fish on after only 5 minutes of being out there and landed this nice one!      At about 7:30, the skunk that been on my back since early December finally came off!!  After a nice fight, I landed this hen….my first ever steelie came in at 22.5”. (It’s a whole ½” bigger than ccmt’s, so I’m rubbing that in…lol).  This one is a keeper so we can have some fresh roe and a nice little snack for later!      Little C was getting a bit cold so I took him back to Timmies to get some warm drinks for everyone.  While we were gone, CC landed this nice one.      The wind picked up and the bite was off, so we decided to pack it in by 10:30 since it was getting quite cold again.  Now, since I’ve never taken roe before, I had to ask CC what to expect,  He said to simply cut it open and it will come out attached to a skein.  Well, I did this with my daughters watching…only there was no skein and they spilled out all over the place.   My 15 year old said “Oh gross” and had to leave the room.  Our 4 year old proclaimed “Ewwww….fish poo!!!”, but was riveted and had to stay and watch til I was done.     Anyhow, thanks very much CC…I had a great time out there and learned a lot!  If I was out there alone, I would have never netted it by myself.  Thanks for letting me use your ""special formula"" roe as well.  Now that I have my first steelie, you can go back and fish with ccmt again...lol  bly"
45151,Jen,2007-03-09 21:43:00,833,"Way to go guys, nice report ...  JEn"
45154,BFSC Kevin,2007-03-09 21:47:00,1351,"good report! just wondering, if you had squeezed her in the stomach, wouldn't the eggs had shot out as well?"
45157,canadian_copper,2007-03-09 21:54:00,925,LOOSE HEN !!! WOW!! LUCKY!!! SHE WAS SOO CHROME I THOUGHT SHE WOULD OF BEEN TIGHT FOR SURE!!! THATS AWSOME!!!

45158,snag,2007-03-09 21:56:00,1932,"AWESOME,  Way to go!"
45159,xrap,2007-03-09 22:02:00,683,"haha fish poo, Nice report and congrats on your first steelie."
45189,PatB,2007-03-09 22:52:00,104,"Nice going, great pics and report.  Bly will get that fish up, more inches for TEAM 9"
45191,DT10Sam,2007-03-09 22:54:00,480,"Great job.   Regards, Sam"
45192,GbayGiant,2007-03-09 23:00:00,1780," No surprise there.  Nice report, you'll have some nice bait for a while now."
45196,ccmtcanada,2007-03-09 23:14:00,7971, LOL...thanks GbayGiant...I'm used to it now.  She has the longest walleye by an inch and heaviest by 1/2 a pound.  My only saving grace is I have two pikes to her zero...haha.
45218,JFR,2007-03-10 00:04:00,498,"""fish poo""  out of the mouths of babes,  great report, glad you had a great day, thanks for sharing.  I guess you're hooked on steel now?  John"
45219,Roy,2007-03-10 00:06:00,13728,"WTG Bly! Just a beautiful report with great pics. You did good!  Y'know what strikes me about this report? A lot of guys go out, fish, catch, take pics and report. That's a good thing. We have some pretty heavy hitters on this board, not the least of which is CC. Scott will take a person with little or no experience with steelies and put them on their first fish the first time out. That's a talent. CC, I reckon you're just a step down from Sainthood.  Thanks again and be well....."
45220,charlied,2007-03-10 00:09:00,584,cha ching....jackpot!   Nice looking fish guys....you lucky bugger.....LOL
45224,Victor,2007-03-10 00:17:00,1609,Great report! Congrats on the PB ... too bad the conditions aren't going to be good tomorrow ... it just has to happen on a day when i don't have work .... o well
45225,ccmtcanada,2007-03-10 00:18:00,7971," Yep...you said it Roy....when he has a ""guest"" with him fishing, he does all he can to make sure that they get a fish.  When he took me steelheading, I caught my first ever chrome with his guidance (and his rod, his reel, his line, his terminal tackle his roe and gave me his 'hot' spot to fish in...LOL).  He's told me that he feels twice as bad being skunked with someone he takes out than if he gets skunked alone.  Scott is a class act...and a great guy to fish with.  Not everyone has the right touch when it comes to teaching the craft, but he's got it.  Actually...not to take away from Scott, but Fishindevil (Shawn) is the same way.  Thanks guys!"
45226,Joey,2007-03-10 00:20:00,9122,"That's fantastic Carol.  Way to go  I've heard a loose hen's eggs are like liquid gold.  Save them for sure and I'll show you how to make roe sacs if you'd like.  Cheers,  Joey"
45236,Canuck2fan,2007-03-10 00:41:00,1444,Awesome report. Always exciting to see someone get their first chrome.
45243,camillj,2007-03-10 00:52:00,1988,"Great stuff .... were you on the left or the right of the 'flow'  Love that liquid gold ... if you really wanna now its terrible stuff ... but dont worry, I'll be happy t take it off your hands and give you some 'REAL' roe  in it's place  :)"
45252,Puckhead,2007-03-10 01:20:00,377,Nice job!  Must have been great fishing with CC.  I swear he could pull a steelie out of parking lot puddle if he wanted to.
45264,Frankypro,2007-03-10 01:40:00,63,"Bly,  I liked that not only did you catcha  nice one   ....you told us the truth about the cleaning part.  So often we catch stuff but stop showing the full picture.  In this case the hen was full of roe and your daughter left the room.  Awsume job!  (not that you made your daughter leave the room but that you showed her the way that it is!)  O.K. now comes the   Great report BLY and I love what Roy said too!"
45265,tonyb,2007-03-10 01:40:00,1637, Eat your heart out guys!  And that right there is why I am proud to have Joey as Captain of TEAM 2!  Tony
45287,canadian_copper,2007-03-10 02:07:00,925,WELL THANKS FOR ALL THE KIND WORDS FOLKS!!! IT WAS A PLEASURE TO HELP BLY OUT TODAY!!! OFFER IS ALWAYS EXTENDED TO THE OFC COMMUNITY!!
45294,fishindevil,2007-03-10 02:23:00,6254,"well done carol..  ..congrats on your first steelhead,and wouldnt you know its bigger than cliffs fish....and you will feed the family with it....WTG     cheers"
45299,Basskicker,2007-03-10 02:31:00,421,Awesome...congrats on the fish. It must have been very cold with that strong southeast wind out there.  That's awful nice of CC to put you on the fish.  Jason
45319,Bly,2007-03-10 03:27:00,1556,"Thanks everyone!  Roy, I think you put it best in regards to CC , what a great guy!  Puckhead...I think you are absolutely correct about CC catching steel in a puddle if he wanted too!   I wish I could answer this question with some reasonable sense of confidence but the best I can do is   Don't know if I am hooked on them but it was a thrill and I now have at least a slight understanding of why people do get hooked!  I have so much to learn about this kind of fishing.....would have walked away with another skunk if it hadn't been for CC.   I understand all too well Victor.....similar to the reasons I haven't been able to get out as often this winter.   Thanks for the offer Joey.  Even though I have not caught any before now, I was ""schooled"" in tying roe in December by big brother and Fishin Devil (thanks again guys) and have spent several evenings practicing, at least now I have some roe worth tying!     I try to teach both of my girls about ""real"" life.  Sydney watched the entire process and even took the picture of the roe then announced that there was NO way she was eating it  LOL  Thanks again everyone! bly"
