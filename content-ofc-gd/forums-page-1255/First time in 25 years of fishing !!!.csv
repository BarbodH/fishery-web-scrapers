44912,camillj,2007-03-09 04:52:00,1988,Wow ... I never really stopped to think about the fact that I have not fished in over 25 years without the pleasure of at least one and normally two packs of smokes .... was quite an experience out on the ice today... even though I was totally skunked ... there was a real fear that my beloved sport wouldnt work without the smokes ... Well ... I made it through a full day on the ice (including 2 1/2 hr drive each way) .... lets just leave it at that .... now gotta look forward to the first day on a trib and .... first day on a boat ... **shakes head **  .... one step at a time
44919,MuskyBill,2007-03-09 05:17:00,311,Baby steps....I feel your pain. I'm trying again right now...
44928,discophish,2007-03-09 05:44:00,392,"Awesome job Jon.  Talk about dedication and a strong will.  That drive up there and back isn't all that short of a measure, that's for sure.  Sorry to hear about the skunk.  Even though the skunk stinks, the smell doesn't last forever.  When the weather is good, fish or no fish, you can't beat the great experience of the outdoors.  Like I said before, make the things you look forward to the most worth the sacrifice.  Stay strong."
44941,Terry,2007-03-09 10:44:00,14456,no worries  the only sports that is better with smokes are  drinking and boozing and swilling
44942,misfish,2007-03-09 11:06:00,29133,"  Good on ya.  I cant seem to get it.I can go all day (leave the pack at home) at work,then once I get home,puff away.       And your point is..............................................."
44951,Terry,2007-03-09 11:35:00,14456,"lol my point was..I needed to give up those 3 sports, in order to quit smoking....."
44964,jigger08,2007-03-09 12:55:00,38,"Congrats Camillj.Set goals as you have done, i.e first day on a stream,on a boat etc.Don't give in until you reach those goals and by then it will be even more bearable.I just passed 17 months myself after a pack+/day for 24 years.You are certainly capable of losing the smokes, and gaining 25 lbs.Its worth it Camillj,you'll feel better and fish longer.Best of luck."
44991,tonyb,2007-03-09 13:57:00,1637,Think of all the fishing stuff you'll be able to buy with the savings from not putting your money up in smoke
45136,1leggedangler,2007-03-09 20:47:00,364,"Congrats! Too bad about the skunk though but I would take the no smokes over the skunk. Keep at er!  Cheers, 1leg"
45138,setomonkey,2007-03-09 21:01:00,872,"Congrats, one step at a time.  Think about all the money you are saving without buying those one or two packs an outing, save it up and spend it on something fishing related, whether it's a new rod & reel, more tackle, or a guided trip you might not have taken otherwise.  Keep it up,  Mike"
45139,douG,2007-03-09 21:01:00,2693,"As you know by now (www.whyquit.org), it only takes 72 hours for the physical cravings to start to go away.  It's easier day by day after that.  Keep at 'er, Camille."
45171,Motorhead,2007-03-09 22:19:00,163,"Nobody likes a quitter.....  Just kidding....  Keep at it and in no time you`ll never even think of smoking... ( so I`ve heard, I still haven`t quit )  Doug"
45182,ryanheritage,2007-03-09 22:41:00,180,Hey just a quick note......about quitting............. You own the smoke it doesn't own you....... Great job on your success!!!
