45345,BFSC Kevin,2007-03-10 05:11:00,1351,i just picked up a maxxum 55lb thrust for $320 including tax.. pretty good deal considering they are normally $420 plus tax there..... i think they will have them at the show and they got some enduras at cheap prices too.. like the 30 was going for $85 i think.. just a reminder for you all that are looking for one!  cheers

45419,PatrickGG,2007-03-10 16:13:00,562, I would rather buy a Refurbished model at least this way you know that the glitches are fixed.
45428,lunkerbasshunter,2007-03-10 16:43:00,2585,wow very good deals!  Cheers!
45464,The Urban Fisherman,2007-03-10 19:26:00,2050,I've got one of the 30lb enduras in my living room right now...itching to be used!  UF
