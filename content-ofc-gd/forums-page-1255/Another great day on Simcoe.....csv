Rhybak,...it was great to fish together again thanks for the great company, hope we'll do it again soon...good luck chasing the lakers /crappies on the weekend... Even it was early and the sun just came up the pictures we took with my cell phone camera are not bad... Enjoy...           Cheers, Ice Fisherman"
