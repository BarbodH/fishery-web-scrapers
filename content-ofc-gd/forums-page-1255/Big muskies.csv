44142,crusty,2007-03-07 03:57:00,83,"Since I couldn't break 15lbs this summer, anyone got pictures of what I'm trying to catch So what nobody on this board caught a big muskie last year?"
44154,muskiebobsr,2007-03-07 04:41:00,49,OK .
44412,Pigeontroller,2007-03-07 22:42:00,2793,My biggest last year! Also my biggest ever! Pushing 25 lbs. I think...  
44466,Bob Devine,2007-03-08 00:37:00,251,Although musky fishing was tougher in 2006 we did manage to catch some good ones. 
44468,Yankee,2007-03-08 00:41:00,2,"Yeah, I'll say you did Bob  You got some good muskie."
44469,GbayGiant,2007-03-08 00:42:00,1780,"Hey Bob that's a beauty. St. Clair ?  Unfortuanately all my pics are on old cameras, Got a Digi last fall, so I plan on putting some pics up on opening day.  I hope."
44591,crusty,2007-03-08 13:28:00,83,Those are some montsers... Really gets the blood pumping Remindes me of how sore your arms can get pitching big baits all day come on June Hey pigeon was that a trolling fish or casting?
44685,Pigeontroller,2007-03-08 19:23:00,2793,"Since you asked Crusty, It was a casting fish. Hit a Topraider about 40 feet from the boat. First fish on a surface bait. Definately one of my best fishing experiences to date!"
44696,linweir,2007-03-08 20:07:00,202,Last year I did good on number but not on size. The biggest one is 21 pound chunky.
44738,Jigger,2007-03-08 22:41:00,1237,"I only really started focusing on Muskie last year, but had good numbers. this is my PB so far. 42.5in fork length w/18in girth. "
44749,Pigeontroller,2007-03-08 23:20:00,2793,"Hey Jigger, thats a nice one! Get comfortable with the gil-plate and belly hold and you will get a nicer pic!"
44750,Doctrt,2007-03-08 23:20:00,141,"Can only guess on the weight of this one, but she was a big girl.  "
44763,Jigger,2007-03-08 23:44:00,1237,"Thanks pigeontroller. I don't have much luck with the gill hold and all the larger fish that I got didn't seem to have a problem being held by the tail. I just make sure the head is over the water incase they freak out. You're right, though. The gill hold makes for much better shots. Thanks again. BTW, Doctrt, thats a BEAUT!"
44860,Pigeontroller,2007-03-09 02:50:00,2793,"Jigger, it just takes alittle practice, I started with the tail hold too...    One of the great things about a BIG pen net is there's no hurry...Lots of time to get acquainted, just becareful of the Gills and TEETH!    "
45092,LebowSKI,2007-03-09 18:45:00,27,"I landed 3 last season, which was my first season targetting them specifically.  A 40"", 34"", and the monster 50"" in my avatar.  I can now hardly think of targetting another species.  "
