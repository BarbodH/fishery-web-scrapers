43711,OhioFisherman,2007-03-06 09:06:00,6623,"Like Phil says the logo on the hat is Ohio, boat looks like a early bass boat late 60`S early 70`s? Ohio`s record is like 55 pounds. Nice fish though where ever it was caught! Did they eat it? LOL"
43780,Garyv,2007-03-06 14:28:00,547,You have to admit there were some great days back then when no one cared about the future because nature would always replenish for years to come.  Yes we were short sighted then but it still was a hell of a lot of fun when you didn't worry about every thing you did and how you did it.  But now back to the reality of today.........
