45457,IanD,2007-03-10 18:41:00,16,I picked up a couple of each at LB's. They look like just the ticket to get big pike and muskie PO'ed. They are also heavy enough that the shock wave from them landing in the water will knockout any 'gills within a 3 foot radius.
45466,lew,2007-03-10 19:47:00,12767,You can ship them up here if you want Glen and I can get them all slimed up and broke in for you in time for Lakair
45474,mattyk,2007-03-10 21:00:00,2110,look pretty nice.
45479,OhioFisherman,2007-03-10 21:19:00,6623,Nice Glen! 3/4 ounce? got any big bass down there?
45480,Pigeontroller,2007-03-10 21:27:00,2793,"I picked up one of the single bladed ones at the TO fishing show, the price was right, but its probably a 1-Muskie lure as Its not very heavy-duty and I doubt it will stand up to the abuse of the fight."

45552,OhioFisherman,2007-03-11 02:03:00,6623,3 and 3/4 ounce? just throw them you gotta knock something out!!
45586,ChrisK,2007-03-11 03:30:00,2772,"Glen, Now that didn't take ya very long !!! Ya got to admit, they are a pretty sturdy bait...9 inches,heavy gauge wire and the rear hook is on its own split ring for easy replacement....Only thing I'm going to do with mine is take off the two stock split rings and replace them with Joe Butcher rings for a little bit of extra confidence...Other than that a few strokes with the sharpening file and its of to the races.....  Cheers !!"
