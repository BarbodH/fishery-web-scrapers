45057,just2manylures,2007-03-09 16:25:00,144,"Glad to see you back on OFC.  Very sorry to hear about you and Sleded breaking up.  Relationships are difficult, finding the one who is right for you may take some time.  But time heals all wounds."

44804,GbayGiant,2007-03-09 01:13:00,1780,"I was wondering the same thing, use to see him on all the time, haven't seen a post from him in  a while."
44814,Bernie,2007-03-09 01:34:00,3190,Geez ...Maybe Clampet....Could be he is a singer too...they went on tour
44815,Roy,2007-03-09 01:37:00,13728,I wondered the very same thing today! Hope he's ok wherever he is.
44816,snag,2007-03-09 01:40:00,1932,Donesville?
44818,Bernie,2007-03-09 01:42:00,3190,Yes Roy... He last posted Feb 22nd . Funny he didnt say anything about going to British Columbia on the forum.
44826,Crazyhook,2007-03-09 01:51:00,1154,maybe writing peoples name in the sand got the best of him?
44827,irishfield,2007-03-09 01:55:00,26272,I just saw him out in fishmasters boat not more than 45 minutes ago.....
44832,nautifish,2007-03-09 02:04:00,1416,Eloped with Nautifish. I have children older than rich thankyou very much.  Rich is doing just fine has been working alot more and has a new love in his life which has also been keeping him busy. Himself and sledded were out on the weekend ice fishing but sleded only caught one Crappie. Ice fishing season for them has not been the greatest this yr which is another reason they have probably not had much reason to post.  They are both madley in love lol.......and these were riches words not mine.  There is more to life than just fishing!   Trust me i allmost fell over when i read that on my forum......lol
44836,irishfield,2007-03-09 02:11:00,26272,   
44837,Gerritt,2007-03-09 02:14:00,6129,   so Sleded and him are in love??? doesnt surprise me a bit...   not that there is anything wrong with that...   Rich does have a face only a mother could love or perhaps another man? being gay seems so poser'ish now.. Good luck with it Rich....   When's the wedding.. their still legal here right? and who is wearing the dress? Will it be White?   Gerritt.
44845,nautifish,2007-03-09 02:23:00,1416,so Sleded and him are in love??? doesnt surprise me a bit...  LOL  Well i think everyone allready knows they are in love Gerrit no surprise they're at all  Gerrit i said he had a NEW!!!!! love in his life....Since when was sledded new in his life?......LOL Those two go way way back......lol
44852,Bernie,2007-03-09 02:31:00,3190,I'm really not too sure of how to take this information.  Dont really know Rich too well as I havent been around too long...  But it is funny  I missed his good posts.
44854,Jacques,2007-03-09 02:35:00,97,So let me get this straight.  He's dating the salmon?
44856,nautifish,2007-03-09 02:40:00,1416,shakes head!*sighs*
44868,joonmoon,2007-03-09 03:08:00,528,To fish with either of these two..BBR or Sleded is and should be an honour to most on this board...lest we forget the Action Angling Tv episodes....man these guys are just plain famous. Anyway I went looking for the infamous BBR and Sleded a few weeks ago in some of their local haunts but didn't find them...Hmmm where could they be....?
44876,Daplumma,2007-03-09 03:17:00,1961,"I miss Rich,he's a good egg.Wayne,I think he paid his dues for that pic,you may wanna let it rest bud. Joe"
44878,danc,2007-03-09 03:17:00,4677,Rich who??
44889,nautifish,2007-03-09 03:47:00,1416,  Actually rich caught that beauty last yr out on one of fishmasters charters. I also beleive it was in one of the fishing mags but cannot remember which one......
44893,joonmoon,2007-03-09 03:58:00,528,Rich and Eric did an Action Angling episode on that day as well.
44895,Fishmaster,2007-03-09 03:59:00,920,I just about feel off my chair LOL ...  but like Joonmoon says they are a laugh to fish with .. Rich & Sleded a little hungry 
44902,Nemo,2007-03-09 04:40:00,727,Yeah I was wondering about him also.  I mean where he was not ....you know???.  Hope all is good.
44945,Rich,2007-03-09 11:21:00,3927," Thanks, jackass!  Anyways Yeah I havent been fishing lately... working tons and other personal stuff has come up. For instance Sleded broke up with me and started chasing those icky girls.  We'll be out more once the ice melts."
44952,magnum,2007-03-09 11:49:00,13,  LOL..........as always you are to much Rich...........Nice to here from you again.
44953,Daplumma,2007-03-09 11:55:00,1961,"My apologies,got thie pic mixed up with another I think..Glad you are back Rich. Joe"
