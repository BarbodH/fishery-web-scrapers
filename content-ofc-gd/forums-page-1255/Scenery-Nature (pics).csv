44866,GbayGiant,2007-03-09 03:04:00,1780,Wow those could all be screen savers and wallpaper. Here's the most memorable encounter I had last year.      
44955,dustink,2007-03-09 12:21:00,526,Some great pics there Basskicker!  Can you tell me where the 3rd & 4th ones are from?  They kind of look like the Scenic High Falls on the Magpie River outside of Wawa.  Thanks for sharing....  dk
44956,Basskicker,2007-03-09 12:36:00,421,"I believe the 3rd and 4th one was taken in N.W.T and Yukon. I have over 500 taken from B.C, Yukon, NWT and Alaska.  I got some really cool pics of some wildlife.....grizzly, buffalo, deer, bald eagle.  Maybe the weekend I'll post a few more if you guys are interested.  Jason"
44958,Eddyk,2007-03-09 12:38:00,195,I was really enjoying those pictures untill the snake showed up.LOL
44966,blaque,2007-03-09 13:02:00,2419,"Heres a couple from our trip to Quebec a while ago. Thought it was a log floating till i noticed it moving and we got closer to her lol. Was quite a swim for the bugger.....i was worried he wouldnt make it as ive never seen a bear swim, but in the shots, you can see he hit the ground running lol    "
45071,ryanheritage,2007-03-09 17:19:00,180,just a quick post of a picture from a weekend in early oct. it was a great time with a few friends.. one boat didnt even have a motor I towed it with my boat just so we could get out that day.  
45167,Rich Clemens,2007-03-09 22:13:00,3131,Geat pics there guys.  Some very nice scenery shots and some places I'd like to visit ... except that darn snake.  I hate those things.
