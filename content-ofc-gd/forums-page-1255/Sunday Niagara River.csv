This pic was taken 2 days ago...it is about1km from the falls.  There is an ice basically an ice bridge across the Niagara from the falls to about 2-3km downstream...locked up solid...when this lets go and Lake erie thaws...gonna be so much ice in the river it will take forever to clear out!  Some of these ice bergs could possibly be 15-20 feet high, looks like I am close doesn't it...but i am not....LOL "

The chunks flush out pretty quickly but the huge stuff near the falls lasts well past ice out on smaller rivers.  Prolly the best river in the East.  Maybe Queenston is fishable."
