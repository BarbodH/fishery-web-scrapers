44980,wuchikubo,2007-03-09 13:35:00,1114,"Hi Everyone,  I was hoping to gather some information in regards to building custom rods (only as a hobby). Does anyone have any suggestions on where to start? Which books should I start reading? Where should I look for building materials?  I have heard Spiel and some other members may have some expert insight. I would appreciate any help.  If you're uncomfortable with posting info on this subject please PM me.  Thanks, Stan (HearingFish)"

44995,wuchikubo,2007-03-09 14:03:00,1114,thanks OF for the info
44999,OhioFisherman,2007-03-09 14:09:00,6623,"No problem, my bro mikey did it till his eyes got bad. LOL they might have always been bad? He came up with some strange colors!"

He sells components (blanks, guides, cork, reel seats, etc) and also sells inexpensive rod stands, motors, brushes, epoxy, etc.  Tom at the Concord location might also be willing to do it as well.  Or if you're near the downtown core, have a talk with Billy at Wilsons.  He gives great advice and he might be able to show you if you ask.  IMO you learn so much more from a person than you do from an internet web-site.  Maybe other board members like Spiel may be able to help."
45086,Baldy,2007-03-09 18:00:00,44,There is quite a bit of info and help on the internet.  If you are into graphite try these sites: http://www.rodbuildingforum.com/ http://www.rodbuilding.org/list.php?2 If you are interested in building a bamboo rod from blanks made by a competent maker: http://p205.ezboard.com/bclarksclassicflyrodforum There are a lot of tips and tricks on these sites and the regulars are only to eager to help a newbie.  Just ask the question. The best way is to find someone who is local to you and is a competent builder and see if you can watch a rod being built. Most important tool is a wrapping jig with a drying motor.  It sure makes life easy.
45108,wuchikubo,2007-03-09 19:26:00,1114," Thanks MJL,  I know of George and Angling Specialties on Kennedy. I didn't know that he'd provide free instruction, maybe it was just for you!!  Yeah, I am hoping Spiel may provide some more insight and perhaps multiple sources for components.  Thanks again, Stan"
45109,wuchikubo,2007-03-09 19:28:00,1114," Thanks Baldy,  I will be book marking these sites.  Stan"
45113,Garyv,2007-03-09 19:43:00,547,Spiel makes some very nice rods.  PM him and ask for some beginner's advice.  I'm sure he will send you in the roght direction.
