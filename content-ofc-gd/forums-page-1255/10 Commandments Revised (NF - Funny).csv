Folks just aren't used to talking in those terms. So, some folks got together and translated the ""King James"" into "" Mountain County "" language.  The Hillbilly's Ten Commandments (posted on the wall at a West Virginia Church )  (1) Just one God. (2) Honor yer Ma &Pa. (3) No tellin' tales or gossipin'. (4) Git yourself to Sunday meetin' (5) Put nothin' before God. (6) No foolin' around with another fellow's gal. (7) No killin.' (8) Watch yer mouth. (9) Don't take what ain't yers. (10) Don't be hankerin' for yer buddy's stuff.  Now that's kinda plain an' simple, don't ya think? Y'all have a nice day!"
