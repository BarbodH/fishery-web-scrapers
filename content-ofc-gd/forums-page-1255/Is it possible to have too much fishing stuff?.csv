45073,LeXXington,2007-03-09 17:23:00,1928,"When getting ready for the upcoming fishing season and then getting giddy    when the BPS flyer came out my wife asked me a simple question...  What could you possibly still buy that you don't already have?  This leads me to a wierd question.  How much is too much  is there a point?  Yeap, I could always upgrade stuff, or buy more spinners, plastics, hooks etc, rods, reels etc.  What would you buy if you could not upgrade excisting stuff or add more baits?"
45074,BFSC Kevin,2007-03-09 17:26:00,1351,upgrade on boat?
45075,trapshooter,2007-03-09 17:29:00,1234,a gor-tex rain suit and a GPS are 2 things I couldn't live without.
45077,Victor,2007-03-09 17:44:00,1609,"I think this is like asking a kid if he/she can ever have too many toys ... Personally, i will say no to that question until i win the lottery one day and buy BassPro + Fishing World (BassPro doesn't have any carp stuff) ... one day .... one day *keeping my fingers crossed*   I'm far from the point where there's nothing to upgrade ... i wish that i'm there ... it's just too hard trying to decide what i should get first and what i should leave on my ""wish-list"" for next year.  If you don't need anymore upgrades on tackle, maybe look into safety gear? I'm sure your wife would be okay with that . (that's why i should buy all my stuff when i'm still single lol)  Victor"
45078,tonyb,2007-03-09 17:45:00,1637,"Boat - Possible upgrades: Auto inflatable life vests, new first-aid kit, safety kit, replace batteries to Optima gellies, Upgrade Sonar/GPS, upgrade trolling motor Apparel - Gore-tex rain gear, Waders/boots, new fishing vest, new polarized sunglasses Tackle - Replace old rusty hooks with sharp Gamakatsu hooks, replace old line, try new lures & replace lost or add to collection of lures General gear: Handheld GPS & hydro charts, 2-Way Radios, Snowmobile, ATV  Fishing is a very expensive hobby!  Tony"
45079,Fishn Technishn,2007-03-09 17:45:00,198,Simple answer...you can never have TOO MUCH!  If I have excess tackle I go thru it and make up a complete tackle kit and find a youngster who does not yet have the fishing bug and start them off on the right track. It sure keeps them off the streets & out of the back of the police cruisers. Although the parents sometimes complain about things like worms in their pockets & wet boots etc. It is still worthwhile....and VERY rewarding.  FT
45090,douG,2007-03-09 18:32:00,2693,I like the suggestions about the goretex rainwear and GPS - that's exactly what I'm doing!
45093,MJL,2007-03-09 18:51:00,2427,"My mom tells me the same thing  My justification equation for buying a new rod (to my mother):  ""This rod only catches pike, not carp"" + (""I got it at a bargain"" x perception factor of what I think is a bargain) + ""I might need a back up in the future"" + ""I need a longer rod, I don't have one this long"" + ""I'm replacing a rod that became obsolete 5yrs ago, it doesn't catch fish anymore"" + ""I just got an A+ on my accounting exam"" + ""This will be the last time I buy a new this type of rod"" / (guilt and forgetfulness factor) = New rod  A usable justification equation for a girlfriend developed by my fishing buddies is  Jewelry + chick flick + painting her nails (or massage) = buy what you want, in any quantity you want   Or use the equation = Just pay in cash and hide it  You can never have too much tackle  The only thing I'm missing now is that 22' Lund with GPS/fish finder capability  Gore-tex rocks to the MAX!  Dad I know you will probably read this but I learned from you. Thanks for the new AngSpec...You can use it to on Tuesdays and Wednesdays"
45094,ecmilley,2007-03-09 19:02:00,2163,there's always something
45095,tonyb,2007-03-09 19:03:00,1637, CLASSIC!
45098,Victor,2007-03-09 19:08:00,1609,Well said Mike.  I should write them down so i have a few excuses ready when i make my next purchase... lol
45166,Rich Clemens,2007-03-09 22:10:00,3131,I ain't got an abundance of lures.  I was just down in the basement the other day putting together a sampling of lure to take to Lakair this year.  Had an awful time trying to decide what to throw in the box.  Pulled a few of each type and we'll see what happens.  I guess we're never satisfied with what we have.
45194,GbayGiant,2007-03-09 23:12:00,1780,"WASS gps will be my next purchase. I think a bow mount electric motor was the best investment I ever made, it allows you to fish so many different ways it's very handy.  The rods reels and lures never end.."
45208,lookinforwalleye,2007-03-09 23:38:00,4399,I don`t know I have a 600 dollar BPS gift card that I am going to spend this weekend and that will probably cover only have of what i will buy this weekend so i guess my answer would be NO!
45237,Greencoachdog,2007-03-10 00:42:00,8163,"They're always coming out with ""New"" stuff."
45242,Canuck2fan,2007-03-10 00:51:00,1444,"All I know is that until I got into chasing chrome I had two rods 3 reels, and all my gear fit into a locker not much bigger than the one I had in high school. After I started steelheading I now have a closet that is 5' long by 4 ' deep and 6' high, that is cramped to the point that I will need to cut out a hole into the space above it for rod storage.....  Before I can even think about fishing the opening this spring I need a center pin reel, neoprene waders, about 20 to 30 jigs, roe tying machine, better rain gear the list goes on.  Notice how I didn't mention what I have already, just in case anyone sees this who might question what I still ""need"" by foolishly comparing it to what I already have ;o) LOL."
45247,huntervasili,2007-03-10 00:58:00,1604,"Well once I ""buy out"" all the spinning stuff I think I need I go try fly fishing and drop a couple K's..."
45302,fishindevil,2007-03-10 02:40:00,6254,"there is no such thing as enough fishing tackle or fishing related items..  ...lol... it never , never  ends.....cheers"
45304,OhioFisherman,2007-03-10 02:48:00,6623,Way to much of the wrong stuff! Some lures that are no longer made that I thought i would never run out of.
