44574,charlied,2007-03-08 12:33:00,584,what are the season's for hunting turkey...curious seen about 20-30 in a field on the way home this morning!
44606,Rob,2007-03-08 14:21:00,467,"  Thanks Chev, I am probably going to sign up for it then.   Rob C"
44607,verno,2007-03-08 14:23:00,178,"Charlie the season is pretty much the month of May.  The 20-30 you see in a group now is probably a winter flock.  They will likely be in the same general area but smaller groups once the season starts.  I'm hoping to get my first bird this year, I only got out twice last year and didnt even see a bird!!"
44840,charlied,2007-03-09 02:19:00,584,I don't hunt anything but was just wondering cause I seen so many in one area.  Is it expensive to get a licence and stuff!
