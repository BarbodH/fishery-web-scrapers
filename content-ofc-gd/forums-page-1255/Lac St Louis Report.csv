Caught a whack of perch and another fish that I'll let someone else talk about. I have some pics and even an entry for team #10. Just a great day. I can't do the report right now cause when I got home, I noticed that Helene had invited 6 friends and J has invited 3 of her friends who should arrive any minute. I'll post as soon as I can....maybe Mike will post something in the meantime. I'll be here later tonight I spose. Thanks for the great day, guys."
