44475,selcram,2007-03-08 00:49:00,26,"Hello!!  As a girl who has a great passion for fishing and the outdoors in general, I've found it difficult to indulge in this sport.  With guys or girls. At the most I could get someone to come out with me for a few hours, usually while camping or at a cottage, but they always lost interest.  Luckily I have finally found a partner who shares it as strongly as me, or more.  Disco Phish has been a great teacher and we have so many awesome memories already and eagerly look forward to the next time we can get out and try our luck. Right now we are in the midst of looking for a boat so we can explore all the great spots Ontario has to offer this coming summer!  "

44677,Virt,2007-03-08 18:28:00,5,"It's been a while but I had to post on this subject. Nice pics btw. Here are a few pics of the yester years of my wife and I. Sorry for the poor quality, pics taken before my digital.  Fishing the Kopka River system south of Wabikimi. This pic was pasted on all 400 bottles of wine at our wedding.    Picture of the story of my life when she comes out with me.  "
44686,irishfield,2007-03-08 19:24:00,26272,Threads goin great everyone....it even brought the 'prince back out of the wood work! LOL
44693,douG,2007-03-08 19:48:00,2693,Ya.  Welcome back to the PrinceCrafty one.
44695,Headhunter,2007-03-08 20:03:00,5703,"My wife is a city girl through and through! The first time I took her fishin, we were on the French, near Alban, renting a cottage from Moonlight Bay Camp. (18 Mile Island area). I took her to a small bay, loaded her rod with a jig, a worm and a bobber and told her to keep a close eye on the bobber and if it moved to set the hook and reel it in. Well the sunfish, perch and rockies were very cooperative that day, unfortunately for them, my wife didn't pay very much attention to her bobber and the fish almost always swallowed the hook! She got very up-set that she was hurting the fish (and feeding seagulls) and we both decided shortly there after that she should concentrate on what made her happiest... holding the front of the boat down, reading a book and catchin some rays! Since that time, I've had the pleasure of the having the best looking balast of any boat in the water! She doesn't fish, but gets a real kick outta watching me catch fish and spending time on the water, enjoying what mother nature has provided! Sure does love to eat'em to! HH"
44697,motv8tr,2007-03-08 20:14:00,2587,"Well let's see, we're not married and I for sure am the better half   , but we do fish together at times.  Most of my fishing is done with Beans though as Steve's and my schedules rarely work out for a day of fishing together.  I like to go out with him though as it's the only way I can get out onto Georgian Bay, and of course he's the one with the boat so he's not all bad  maureen"
44884,Fishnfiend,2007-03-09 03:21:00,357,btt for Jen.... 
44888,joonmoon,2007-03-09 03:45:00,528,"Glad to see there are lots of couples out gettin er done together on the water. My wife Goog55 wanted to spend more time together so I said ""you'll have to learn how to fish"" and she's still kickin my butt on the water 15 yrs later.         Gotta luv her my wife and my best friend. xx oo"
44890,Fishnfiend,2007-03-09 03:48:00,357,that catfish looks like dunnvillle...
44892,joonmoon,2007-03-09 03:56:00,528,Yup it was.
44925,selcram,2007-03-09 05:33:00,26,"  Hey!! From a beautiful bay in the Parry Sound area that faces west.  Aptley named, it's called ""Sunset Bay"" and there's a break that drops from 5- 8' deep running the length of it that a wide variety of fish are consistantly found on. It usually produces early evening ( as you can see from the pictures ) and this is one of the larger ones caught there.  It was released for better days!!"
44926,Jen,2007-03-09 05:37:00,833,What?  - Geeze guys! 
44943,graftongal,2007-03-09 11:14:00,145," Jeeze Dan, why'd you have to go and ruin a good picture of Sis by putting that ugly mug in there?"
45035,cityfisher,2007-03-09 15:14:00,959,My babe loves to hit the soft or hard water with me  shes a keeper  
45068,lovetofish,2007-03-09 17:05:00,500,"I take my girlfriend all the time.  When we first started going out, i decided to put her up to a little test.  I took her perch fishing, in the boat, in April, in 0 degree weather.  She did less complaining about the weather then i did    I've been taking her with me ever sinse  lovetofish"
45112,snag,2007-03-09 19:42:00,1932,"It's easy to see true love when it's right in front of you.  Even when it's forbidden fruit.       Good luck guys,  We're behind you."
45187,Dutch,2007-03-09 22:49:00,831,"Mine does, she loves it.  Sorry, no pictures."
44152,fishdawg,2007-03-07 04:24:00,912,"Well our honeymoon was a ""fishing-moon"" in Kirkland Lake - not a bad way to spen your first week together huh?  Every so often i can get Andrea to come along with me - I took her out to a local mud puddle last summer & she whupped me using a float & worm while i pitched artificals looking for the big one   really wanna get her on a leaping/screaming salmon this spring - dunno if it'll scare her sh*tless or if she's gonna wanna come out every time afterwards?"
44169,Bob,2007-03-07 05:32:00,370,"Peggy fishes with me all the time.  Fact of the matter is, she's often the one dragging or pushing me out the door to get going down to the boat.  She just loves to be on the water but she doesn't much like the rough stuff.  If the waves get to be six footers, she wants dry stuff under her and that's ok with me too.  I like to be comfortable when I'm fishing, or even just out for a boat ride.  Thirty years ago, rough water was a challenge that I laughed at but now I take it easy.  We go out on the good days, cruise and drag a couple of lures behind and it's all good.  Taking things a little easier than we used to and if we get a fish, it's a bonus and usually supper."
44176,lickmyarmpit,2007-03-07 06:33:00,359,"She rarely comes with me but she isn't a big fan of the outdoors, theres nowhere to shop.  Camping NEVER her idea of camping is a hotel room with no room service."
44343,Entropy,2007-03-07 20:11:00,747,Wouldn't be with a woman who didn't ( come with me that is      you know what I mean    ).   
44370,Fishnfiend,2007-03-07 21:21:00,357," Wow, u sound perfect!  I'd even let you drive the Tundra"
44414,fishergirl72,2007-03-07 22:43:00,455," I could not agree with you more. What is more perfect then a fresh fish breakfast and sunrises with a fresh cup of coffee.  I fished as well when I was a little girl while my brother and sister stayed behind but I didn't really get into it until I met Fishindevil.  Now I get out whenever I can, but it is also important for Fishindevil to fish on his own or with his buddies, everyone needs their own downtime, including me.LOL"
44423,Handlebarz,2007-03-07 23:11:00,3790,I guess it goes with out saying that MRS EH fishes with me alot and the family comes along also my daughter took this pic for the wife with her first slimer small but fun.  
44426,irishfield,2007-03-07 23:20:00,26272, NO it wouldn't be Jed...but no reason it can't be the next one... LOL
43504,irishfield,2007-03-05 22:26:00,26272,Basskickers thread and Zib asking him how he found a women that fished brings me to ask. How many of you lads and gals have a better half that enjoys going fishing with you?  With Leah being the oldest of three girls...her Dad brought her up right..as a son LOL.  Fushimi Aug 2003 on our 21st anniversary  Fushimi Lake - Hearst - Aug 2004..again on our anniversary  Opening day in May 2005  Opening Day Lake Temagami 2006  A not so fun day a couple days later  Sept/06 ready to portage the tinny over a beaver dam into a back lake off Temagami  Ice fishing Feb/07

43512,Rich Clemens,2007-03-05 22:37:00,3131,"My wife goes with me all the time as well.  She'll fish for quite until ... we'll,  while the fish are biting anyway.  When things get slow, she just enjoys sitting back and catching up on her reading.  ALl four of us really enjoy being out on the boat ... the wife, the two dogs, and myself.  It's nice quiet time together.  She'a a little disappointed that she won't be able to make the trip to Lakair with me in June."
43513,Bernie,2007-03-05 22:40:00,3190,My wife loves to fish.....funny.... shes not real crazy about cleaning them though
43514,trapshooter,2007-03-05 22:40:00,1234,After I found out she could catch these....   AND Drive this.....   I had to put one of THESE on her finger....     TechnaGirl and I will be married this Oct 27th.

43522,charlesn,2007-03-05 22:52:00,551,"The last time I took my wife fishing was in a fun club tournament.  Blast off was at 8 AM, so we woke up at 8, got breakfast and then launched the boat at 11:00 AM.  We had a great time and she caught a 4.4 lb largemouth from the back just after someone had rudely cut their boat literally inches from the back of my boat cutting off the area she was casting to (we had caught a number of fish in front of them).  Needless to say we celebrated the big fish quite loudly to the chagrin of the jerks and she proudly posed with it at the weigh-in.    She talked excitedly about that fish for months.  She was pregnant and unable to get out much last summer but just recently has been talking about how she's wondering if she still has ""the touch"".  Can't wait until my daughter catches her first fish...  Charles"
43527,Tybo,2007-03-05 23:00:00,1373,"Why Wayne?  You going to take her off my hands for, say a couple of                                 YEARS!!!"
43529,setomonkey,2007-03-05 23:03:00,872,"My wife likes to fish, but not for a long time and she gets bored if she's not catching. Here's a pic from last week in Florida, her first saltwater fish, a jack crevalle.  Gave her a really nice fight, and it was exciting to watch because the water was boiling from what was probably a school of jacks busting bait right in front of the dock where we were casting from...    Mike"
43537,Bly,2007-03-05 23:14:00,1556,  :P  Enough said  lol   bly
43542,GbayGiant,2007-03-05 23:20:00,1780,My girlfriends don't last long enough..  But my mom and sisters make me take them out fishing....Man I wish I could trade in 3 sisters for one brother.  Anyone wanna trade ? lol.
43544,Rizzo,2007-03-05 23:22:00,4754,"HAHAHAHA, my wife go fishing???  I DON'T think so, can't haul her out of the mall long enough."
43553,Greencoachdog,2007-03-05 23:31:00,8163,"I can get Ol' Yeller to go every once in a while, she's such a magnet! She always catches the first fish, and sometimes is nice enough to stop fishin' 'til I catch up!  Here we are on our Honeymoon, I think she had me like 3-0 before I caught my first fish... and she was actually nice enough to let me catch the most fish that day!   Redfish, Sheepshead (saltwater, and a Black Drum that liked to have pulled Ol' Yellers shoulders out og the sockets!  Here she is again with the first fish of the day as usual.   She is a ""fairweather"" fisher person, won't go if it's too hot and won't go ice fishin... but when she does go... look out!!!"
43555,DT10Sam,2007-03-05 23:33:00,480,"My Laurie does whenever we get a chance to all go as a family.  Family outings are real nice and we get a kick out of watching the kids catch fish.  Regards, Sam"
43559,PatB,2007-03-05 23:36:00,104,"My bride will come out all day with me, crossword puzzles and magazines and catching a few rays is what she dose. She is not much of a fishing person, but still love her the same."
43565,Zib,2007-03-05 23:44:00,369,"Me so jealous.  BTW Irish, it's ZIB NOT Zig. lol"
43567,irishfield,2007-03-05 23:48:00,26272, Two keys side by each...will fix that right up...
43571,pikehunter,2007-03-05 23:51:00,1659,"Yep, she does, but not every time. She went to the Grand R. once or twice last year and we had a weekend on Couchiching last summer nailing the perch.  Funny thing is...she often catches more than my son or I"
43580,Puckhead,2007-03-06 00:04:00,377,"My wife tried it once a few years ago.  Caught a little bass that inhaled a small spinner deep - no chance for the bass to survive, so I took it out of it's misery with a paddle, she's never picked up a rod since...  Probably not the best intro to fishing  Getting her to a cottage now is a minor miracle."
43587,ccmtcanada,2007-03-06 00:12:00,7971,"If anything, my wife is more of a fanatic than I am!!!  Anyhow, I am lucky...fishing is either family time or just ""our"" time together.  There's nothing more I'd rather do than spend the day fishing with them."
43588,tinbanger,2007-03-06 00:15:00,1028,My wife's complaint is she doesn't get out enough . The new larger boat last year was her idea !  Planning to get her out on Lake O for some trout/salmon action this summer .  ( keep that to yourself Pikeie don't want to spoil the surprise) The sacrifices we make for our spouses !  TB
43592,lew,2007-03-06 00:22:00,12767,"It's been about 10 years since my wife fished with me, but for alot of years prior to that she was a very avid fisherman and had no qualms about heading out at 4:00 in the morning or 9:00 at night  Heck, she even landed a 14 pound musky off the end of the dock all by herself at 6:00 AM one morning while she was trying to catch a pickeral for breakfast while I was out in the boat getting skunked.......she still rubs that one in every chance she gets"
43604,Garyv,2007-03-06 01:00:00,547,"Wife used to fish with me until about 20 years ago, now health problems has made that almost impossible....thats why I have my dog Amy traveling everywhere with me.  My daughter loves to fish but with her and her husband working and having a young family ( 4 and 2 ) it's almost impossible to get her out.  We keep talking about doing a family trip  in the next few years and will have to see what will happen."
43631,Nanook,2007-03-06 01:56:00,565,"Wifey started fishing a few years ago,enjoyed catching Sunnie's and Perch.I had to do the baiting and taking fish off the hook.............Then she hooked a decent sized Muskie,when it jumped, she looked at me............tossed the rod AT me. She has never been since, scared the bejaber's out of her. She dont like boats either!!!!"
