45472,The Urban Fisherman,2007-03-10 20:28:00,2050,Hey Fishmaster!  This 38 inch girl is my first and only salmon - caught off the rocks in Port Credit last fall.  I fish that river nearly every saturday and sunday of the open water season.  This spring I'm gettin' a small boat so come fall I won't have to fight for elbow room on shore!  I'm going to park myself just out of casting range of the crazies on shore......Last year two guys almost went at it over a tangled line! hahaha no thanks!  UF  
45476,Uncle Buck,2007-03-10 21:02:00,1000,This is why we shouldn't use Fish Bonkers...  
45483,lickmyarmpit,2007-03-10 21:49:00,359," LOL  Actually its a disease mostly found mostly in hatchery fish called whirling disease it damages skeletal tissue and cartlidge.  I found this out after i caught a fish in Bronte creek that looked similar to that one in the pic, did some research and found articles like this. http://www.courier-journal.com/apps/pbcs.d...608/1002/SPORTS"
45513,icefisherman,2007-03-10 23:52:00,952,"I've started fishing for the big boys in the big O and Errie waters last year. Planning to start early and be more regular this year.Need to get myself another downrigger and second rod/reel combo and I'll be set to go. Always looking for good company on the water as well. Here is a nice one from last August on Lake O.    Cheers, Ice Fisherman"
45535,ryanheritage,2007-03-11 01:14:00,180,"anyone got any tips for me? I have a 14' lund deep with a 15hp honda four. I am going to start the lake O salmon this year. My set up is 2 big john electrics that I bought a few years back and some spoons ( have no clue were I got em) I live in ajax so I am gona be out at both nuke plants (pickering and darlington) but I really don't have a good idea on speeds or baits or even how far out from the cannon ball I should be back with my baits. I used to fish salmon as a kid with a family friend my biggest was a 28pnd chin, with a serious coho at one time as big as a carp but lost it ( insert fish story here) ever since then I have had the itch to go out again but never had the means till now. Any ideas on how to get a good start for speeds? or baits?"
45537,Fishmaster,2007-03-11 01:24:00,920,Get yourself some Spin Doctors Mountain Dew Crush and Atomik flies ....find what depth the fish are let out 10 ft lead hook to your ball you will catch fish ..Lymans are also good NK spoons Dream Weaver Spoons when ya go to a tackle store look on the wall for the last of that color lure  thats usally the hot baits

44851,Pigeontroller,2007-03-09 02:29:00,2793,"I got out a few times last year, got a few fish with in-line planer boards early, then a couple fish in August off the Rigger and off Dipsey's...Got a second rigger for this year, and some more rods, planning to do more of it since i'm minutes away from Lake O.

Had a pretty good summer for someone who didn't (or still doesn't) know anything about downriggin!! As for tips I'm not too sure I can pass any your way but I'm always interested in new ideas.  Craig

45025,jediangler,2007-03-09 14:56:00,1923,"Here's a tip for you, don't eat anything you catch in Lake Ontario. I've only caught 5 chinook from Lake O and 2 were horribly deformed. "
45032,Fishmaster,2007-03-09 15:05:00,920,There is nothing wrong with eating Salmon from Lake Ont ....that fish was deformed from the Hacth..  See your HUmpy in the center ..its not very easy to pick out all the bad fish outa a Million Fry.. 
45055,POLLIWOGG,2007-03-09 16:10:00,835,We did the salmon thing for years but we are getting out a lot later in the day and have to pass over some great walleye spots on the way so we spent most of last year fishing eyes.  Now that we decided to ell with the big $ derby tickets freinds are asking to go after the salmon and I hope to get out more this year.
45058,bassassin,2007-03-09 16:25:00,152,"Fish have abnormalities regardless of the body of water!! The big ""O"" has its fair share of beautiful fish, and in my opinion is a world class fishery that we have right in our back door.  For instance take a gander at these beauties from last year:  Big King @ Night:     My Bro & Pops With a descent king and a 17lb COHO what a beaut!    GOOD MORNING Miss ""O""    Breathtaking Morning:    What A Bigun!! (Notice the smile talk about proud of myself!)     Were Lucky to have such a quality fishery in our back yard!!!  and theres nothing wrong with taking a little one home for the BBQ These are short lived animals, im sure if you ate a twenty pound pike (20 yrs old) from the same waters that would be plenty of time for it to build up a signifiquent amount of mercury in its flesh, but a 5 lbs salmon is probably around 1 yr old, I highly doubt thats enough time to build up to much mercury in its flesh. Just my opinion,  Jason!"
45066,muskieb,2007-03-09 17:00:00,58,"I finally got a boat big enough to start playing in the big waters for the salmon last fall.  Hoping to be on Lake Ontario within the next few weeks learning how to catch them.  Should be fun, hopefully won't take too long to catch onto what they like.  Can't wait!"
45070,LeXXington,2007-03-09 17:10:00,1928,"Arron and Barry did a great show on spring salmon,  if you can find it lots of good information on it.  Ahhh bring on the spring"
45117,HookNrelease,2007-03-09 19:49:00,85,YEAHHHHHHHHHH roll on the spring kings we need some more DINKS like this 33lber 
45149,spoonman,2007-03-09 21:31:00,103,"Spring is right around the corner which means times for Lakers and Salmon. Can't wait. First start with planners, then dipsys then riggers, then casting Cleos in fall.  An early spring Salmon from Last year   An early Lake Trout from last spring   Cheers Al www.alsadventures.ca"
45190,Pigeontroller,2007-03-09 22:52:00,2793,"Correct Fishmaster, that pic was just past Charles Daley heading west...You can see the Beacon(used to be the family business) in the top right corner!"
