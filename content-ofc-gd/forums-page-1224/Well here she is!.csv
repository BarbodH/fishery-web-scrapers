66704,Gerry,2007-05-01 21:52:00,257,"I always like to name pets for what comes to mind the first time you see them. When my girls were little we introduced a cat and so I asked them what the cat made them think of. The cat was balck and white so my 5 year old says, without hesitation, that he (a male) looked liked an Oreo cookie. So that was it, we named him Oreo.  As for you new dog, my first impression is that she has an ashen colour. So there, I would call her 'ashes'."

61322,finfan,2007-04-17 21:16:00,44,Very cute little dog! Princess seems quite comfortable with her around. How about the name scruffy or scruffer.

We have finally decided on a name for her.  She seems to be settling in really well. Took her for her 1st walk last night with princess. Boy!oh boy!....lol...She has never been on a leash so it was quite the adventure......lol.....We have had no accidents in the house with her you take her out she does her #1 or #1 & 2....lol...which is great.  I was naughty last night and let her sleep with me yeah i know bad bad bad not good.....But i figured her 1st night & a really big day for her yesterday i did not want to leave her on her 1st night with different surroundings and such. So this morning i am going to be bringing up one of the spare carriers we have and make that up for her and tonight she will be sleeping in they're. So i may not get too much sleep tonight.....lol..... But she seems to be settling in great and princess is just loving her which i am just thrilled about.
