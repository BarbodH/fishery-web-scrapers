66438,zman,2007-05-01 12:02:00,179,Well I mounted the new motor on the weekend  but now I am going to move the batteries over a couple of feet and I will be short on the wire going to the batteries from the new Minn-Kota . What should I do ? Do I have to run all new wire ?if so what is the best type or can I just attach a another section I have a 80lbs Maxxum
66443,Terry,2007-05-01 12:40:00,14456,"you can just add wire I would buy the heavy battery cable with the ends on them, then bolt them together  tight and tape them up"
66448,Roy,2007-05-01 12:54:00,13728,"Yes, as long as you have good clean connections. I like to use heat shrink tubing over the soddered connections. Use 10 GA wire. You should also move the fuse in closer to the battery."
66449,zman,2007-05-01 13:01:00,179,So Is 10 Gauge wire ok for my size of motor  (80lb Maxxum ) from the bow to the stern 17.5' I will check and see what the current size is Also I seen a fuse or Breaker that you put right on the battery
66451,Terry,2007-05-01 13:04:00,14456,oh....10 ... I would rewire the whole thing with 8 or better yet 6 and make sure you have a breaker inline near the battery
66469,Whopper,2007-05-01 13:40:00,2174,Terry is correct rewire with at least #8 or #6 would be better yet and install the circuit breaker or fuse right at the battery if possible.  Whopper
66555,Guest lundboy,2007-05-01 16:14:00,0,"If it's possible, I would mount a jack at the front and run 8 (or 6 gauge, more expensive jack and plug) wire to it fresh, then put the plug on the motor at the front leaving only about 3 ft of wire or less on the motor.  This will make it easier should you have to remove the motor for repair or storage as well.  http://www.basspro.com/webapp/wcs/stores/s...0002000_200-2-4  And as stated earlier, get the 50amp breaker attached to positive at the battery end."
