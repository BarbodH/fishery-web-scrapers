66225,The Urban Fisherman,2007-04-30 20:14:00,2050,"Woke up @ 6 a.m. to feed the baby, got her back sleeping and into bed with mom by 6:45 and was knee deep in the credit river by 7:15 a.m.          Fished my butt off for for 3 hours, hit 4 different pools and the results were all the same....shiners, shiners and more shiners!  I couldn't keep the darn things off my hook!    So I switched to a big old ""roe"" bag and upsized to huge chubb minnows.  It's hard to tell in the pic but this guy was a solid 6-7 inches....   In the past year my Credit Catches include:  Bass Pike Drum Carp Walleye Salmon Suckers Shiners  ....I thought it was a steelhead river? haha  Tomorrow's another day!  Cheers, UF"

66228,ch312,2007-04-30 20:29:00,1590,try fryin up some chub like smelt and see how they taste
66229,douG,2007-04-30 20:29:00,2693,Great report - I'm sure that will ease last weekend's results for more than a few fishers.  Nice photos too.  Thanks.
66234,snag,2007-04-30 20:36:00,1932,"Did ya use a net?!  Nice photos, I thought of hitting some of those spots........  I'm suprized you didn't see more people.  It was crazy last year. Kinda turned me off. I'll get over it though and try again, hopefully.  Cheers"
66238,The Urban Fisherman,2007-04-30 20:40:00,2050," Yeah so I was told when I made the report last summer.....    Two in one night to!!!!  mmmmmmmmmmmmm   Cheers, UF"
66300,Greencoachdog,2007-04-30 23:24:00,8163,You shoulda put those little bait stealing turds on a 3/0 circle hook and threw thier little butts back in!
66304,xrap,2007-04-30 23:31:00,683,Dam wasn't expecting a pic like that!!  My dad caught a 13lb walleye in a trib we fish for pike that is no more then 4 feet deep.  The walleye was big and chunky and it only had 1 eye. Weird but it was nice clean and healthy (except for the 1 missing eye lol). Sometimes it's funny where you can catch trophy fish. Thanks for sharing
