Not to worry, timing is everything after you know some locations. I was just to lazy to go to certain spots due to the distance. My other friends did well as they caught them in the deeper water. Did anyone else fish on these two lakes this weekend?"

The water was clear with no fresh green weeds or lilly pads. They must be in the deeper water for now. I was using plastic and no live bait."
