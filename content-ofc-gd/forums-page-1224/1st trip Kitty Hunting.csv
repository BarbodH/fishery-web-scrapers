66222,highdrifter,2007-04-30 20:00:00,2534,"Haha!  That title is a tad misleading...  The younger generation woulda thought you had gone kuna hunting, while the older gents may have thought you had been out after some puma!!  gnaawwww  Good stuff though!  I'm sure she was tasty...  cheers  HD"
66226,spanky,2007-04-30 20:26:00,195,"nice night out tho, eh?!  we had the same luck the other night... i've got about a 11% hook up rate with 1/0 circle hooks, suddenly i don't feel so bad... but i know you'll pick it up like you do every year and show me just how awful i am lol"
66230,BFSC Kevin,2007-04-30 20:29:00,1351, WHAT??? you did NOT use them as bait? what a waste!    lol
66259,Fishmaster,2007-04-30 21:35:00,920,Never thought of trying that  Mouse and Cats  might be a good combo ...as for 1/0 circle hooks way to small i use 4/0 and 5/0 big cat circle hooks ...you might wana try bigger hooks just a thought ...
66272,spanky,2007-04-30 22:07:00,195," i assume you carry them Steve? can't find them around here, 1/0 is the biggest i can get.... i know i need bigger ones, just can't find them is all... might come by one day and grab a pack or 2!!"
66630,Fishmaster,2007-05-01 18:24:00,920,Should have more in tommrow ..and yes they are hard to find the 4/0 & 5/0 but you will find your 11% will climb to 80%
