66273,Beans,2007-04-30 22:08:00,3339,YEP ! *BURP*...That Meely sure does put on a spread...Gotta give him credit for sticking to his food plan (diet)...All that great scoff and he had salad with canned tuna and a couple of pieces of the crappie fillets...  Thanks to a couple of the others that didn't eat fish I got to bring home a half dozen pieces of crappie for Maribeth which she enjoyed with a romain lettuce salad and raspberry vinaigrette dressing...  I ended up having a dozen pre-cooked shrimp and a couple of hard boiled eggs with my cottage cheese and romain lettuce...that'll teach me to not catch any fish...LOL  Mind you he can pack away my home cooked Chinese food...
