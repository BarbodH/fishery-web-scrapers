66261,bmallard,2007-04-30 21:38:00,5,"Hey guys,  My sister was recently the lucky recipient of a cottage and up at their lake there is Perch, Pickerel, Muskie, Crappie and Bass....  Does anyone have any suggestions to what gear and tackle I should get... all I have now is a Ultra Light rod with 6lb test line....  Any help would be greatly appreciated....  Thanks,"
66267,dodger1414,2007-04-30 21:51:00,44,the ultra light should be fine for your pickeral and crappie but u will need alot heavier gear for the muskie for sure..i would almost suggest getting a baitcasting reel to fish for the muskie with heavier line and that could work for your bass as well..i personally use a baitcasting reel with 20 pound braided spiderline on it and it works fine for bass and for the muskie..20 pounds may seem a little extreme but i have lost way too many lures to muskie because i was unprepared so i fugure it doesn't really hurt to be ready..
66269,bmallard,2007-04-30 21:55:00,5,Thanks for the reply... I have never used a baitcast reel before... are there any good brand names I should shop for? any suggestions for a rod and lures as well?  Thanks Again

The ultra light will do for the crappie and perch, you will need a medium or medium heavy action, 10-17lbs rod to handle bass and walleye but one rod for each species might be a better idea a medium for Walleye and medium heavy for bass is standard.  Definitely a separate muskie rod for sure, the Pete Maina combo at bass pro for around $200 is a good start and price with 80lbs line is standard.  I'm afraid you have a lot of reading to do those are some questions that take some time to learn, but this would be the bare minimum to get started.  As far as lures, I would suggest searching this site for lot's of good info or do a Google search on each species and start reading, you have a lot to learn my friend, it takes time, you are tackling a lot of information for 1 post, it would take about 100 posts to cover all the species for rods, reels, lures ect.. you mentioned."
66316,mepps,2007-05-01 00:14:00,1301,"I think you would be fine with one more rod and reel (uless you have cash to blow) Chances are you pobably wont be targeting musky right away (if you do you need heavy gear - some people will use up 80lb braded line)  Your best chances of success are  perch, Crappie and Bass - you can catch these with light to medium gear, although I use at least 30lb braided line on my regular setups.  If you want a challenge, go for musky, but make sure you are well prepared (leaders, plyers, nets, bravery, heavy line)"
66370,pigeonfisher,2007-05-01 02:18:00,696,"is your sister married?  hahahahah  I would suggest a medium weight rod (not sure?)  Take a ugly stick or a Shimano Compre if you want to spend the extra for a lifetime warrante.  Most Shimano 2000 series reels will do you fine, some are better than others.  My choice would be a Quantam Catalyst pTi.  You can go as little as $50 for a combo that will work for the summer, maybe your life.  A mid range combo will get you between between $100-$150 and then a ""matched set"" will run between $150 and $200.  Have fun!"
