Jen was at my house by 4:10. A quick stop off at Tim Hortons and we were off. The drive went great no troubles nor traffic. (who else is up at 4am).  We arrived in Orillia at 6am, another quick stop at Timmy's. Met up with Sonny and his father, and headed to Trembly's for some minnows, derby tickets etc. I was a little cold and bleak in Orillia but managable.  We were on the water with our lines wet by 7:30. Fish were there but a little fusy soft mouthing the minnows. Fish finder was showing lots all day. The new aqua view finder confirmed the fish were there but a little fussy, they would watch the bait but not all that active to attack it. The Aqua View is absolutly fantastic. It was far more than I expected...    We took a brake in the action around 1:30 for some lunch at where? Timmy's again...Then back to the action. Jen and I were non stop all afternoon with some real amazing fish.  We were back to the ramp at 7pm to register our catch for the draws. It took some time as some were having trouble getting stuck with their vehicles.  Off to the hotel rooms for the night. We headed via shuttle to Casino Rama for some dinner as the Hotel restaurant had a wedding that I don't believe we were invited to.  Sunday was an amazing day, the weather was fantastic. The fishing was a little slower than Saturday. The fish were still there and the Aqua View again confirmed this but slower fishing. We were back at the ramp at around 3:30pm to get our fish register again.. Loaded up the boats and the trailers, for our journey home to Hamilton.    Over all between the 5 of us we caught some 450 perch, and kept only 20%. Now the real work began cleaning the fish.   I would like to thank Jen, Sonny and our fathers for sharing this weekend.

66364,Jen,2007-05-01 02:03:00,833,"It was a very good weekend, thought I would add a couple more pictures...  The public boat launch was a ""joy"" to say the least... water was a cool 41 degrees, although for the end of April I would have to say we couldn't have done better weather wise...  Spending the weekend with Family doing something you love can not be beat...  "
