66470,Fang,2007-05-01 13:40:00,1330,"Hey Bill,  beauty looking river, Has been on my to do list for a while. maybe one day. The lamprey is most likely an American brook lamprey and the life cycle of the sea lamprey we all hate  does not have any presence past 1"" in freshwater rivers. I have seen these for years on the upper credit and took photos to an MNR office to make sure.  These are harmless filter feeders that actually help to keep the gravel beds clean."
66485,Bly,2007-05-01 14:43:00,1556,I know that you were really looking forward to this outing.........Good to hear that you had a nice day and that you landed some fish!  Thank you for sharing your opener with us   Bly
66650,huntervasili,2007-05-01 19:38:00,1604,Thanks all... It is alot of fun fishing with a 3wt and 1.8 lb tippet lol I am glad to know that those lampreys are harmless and not the sea lamprey... I never realized it was harmless... they were cool looking though and look like a bass worm/plastic of some sort.
66255,suds,2007-04-30 21:25:00,70,"Nice job Bill. I would have taken some small ones!  I got the skunkaroo, as did most others fishing where I was, but I was ecstatic to be out chucking flies nevertheless.  cheers suds"
66256,huntervasili,2007-04-30 21:30:00,1604,"Hey... flingin' flies is the fun, fish are a bonus... Plus the scenery... it makes a great day none the less... I was out from about 6 until about 6pm, so fish obviously wasnt too much in abundance but we stayed because it was an awesome day to be out"
66355,BryceBurzynski,2007-05-01 01:48:00,181,Nice report! I might have to check that place out!
66362,FishFinder,2007-05-01 01:57:00,481,Did you really need the net to land those smolts  :P
66363,007,2007-05-01 01:59:00,537,Thanks for the report.  They may be small but at least you caught some fish.  Congrats. 007
66367,huntervasili,2007-05-01 02:08:00,1604,"well I use barbless hooks so the net keeps em from falling off on me... plus I'd rather use a net than try to grab him, and risk squishing the little guy"
66402,MJL,2007-05-01 04:40:00,2427,Great report.  I often get those smaller resident fish by accident while I'm steelheading.  Fishing for those little trout looks like a blast...Especially on the dry fly.  Looks like something I may want to try my hand at in the future.  It'll be a whole new experience using those ultra-lite fly rods rods (5wt and less).  I thought my 8wts were light (at least for what I normally use them for).  That is one gorgeous brown.
