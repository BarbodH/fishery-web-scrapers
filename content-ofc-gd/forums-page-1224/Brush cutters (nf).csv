I run one behind a tractor and would never even think of walking behind something that can split rocks, cut small trees..etc. I'd think having a guy drop by with a backhoe would be the cheapest..quickest..safest solution.  Using a brush cutter / bush hog will leave all those sapling trunks sticking up to poke tires etc. so you'd need to dig those out anyway...and why I suggest one shot with a hoe/exacavator."
