66239,Garyv,2007-04-30 20:41:00,547,Nice to read that most are getting out and having a good time.  Hopefully by June I can do the same.  Suffered a setback when my incision open up and got infected. Never felt so weak in my life.  Looks like 3 more weeks of VON for me.  Keep  the pictures and reports coming they sure are nice to read.
