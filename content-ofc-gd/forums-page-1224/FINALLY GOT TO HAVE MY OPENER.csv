66235,xrap,2007-04-30 20:36:00,683,Wow you'd think this late in the season the fish be in thier spawning coulors. Lots of fresh fish there Wtg CC great report.
66247,Gerritt,2007-04-30 21:03:00,6129,"CC, nice report!  I have a question for you seeing as how you know your Rainbows (and for anyone else for that matter).  After the Spawn are the fish lethargic at all? Do you think because they are weaker that post-spawn fishing increases the mortality rate? Do you find them easier to catch post-spawn therefor more are taken home for the table?  (less chance of getting skunked)   Thanks in advance!  Gerritt."
66260,dodger1414,2007-04-30 21:38:00,44,congrats man...looks like a great day
66280,canadian_copper,2007-04-30 22:24:00,925,TX ALL!! GERRIT- AFTER THERE DONE SPAWNING THEY START TO EAT EVERYTHING IN THERE PATH!!! HENSE AT THIS POINT WHY ANYONE CAN CATCH A FISH COME OPENER  LOL DOES NOT TAKE THEM LONG AT ALL TO GET BACK INTO SHAPE!!! YES THEY WOULD BE LETHARGIC IF YOU CAUGHT THEM HRS AFTER THEY HAVE SPAWNED!!!BUT THESE FISH HAVE LOST ALL THERE SPAWNING COLOURS AND ARE ALMOST BACK TO PURE CHROME!!! AND THE FIGHTS WERE VERY POWERFUL!!! A HIGH MORTALITY RATE THIS TIME OF YR COME FROM FIGHTING A FISH TO LONG!!! WHEN THE FISH IS FIGHTING IT BUILDS UP THIS ACID IN THE BODY(SORRY I CANT REMEMBER THE NAME RIGHT NOW ) AND CAN BE DEADLY!!! IMPROPER HANDLING OF FISH ALSO!!! JUST TODAY I WAS WATCHING A GUY CATCH FISH !!! HE'D PICK THE FISH UP UNDER THE GILL PLATE(which is fine if you know what your doin) BUT THEN HE'D THROW THE FISH ABOUT 3 FT BACK INTO THE WATER FROM THE GILL PLATE!!!! OFCOURSE I SAID MY PIECE TO HIM BUT YA COULD TELL HE JUST DIDNT CARE!!!!
