66052,BryceBurzynski,2007-04-30 10:31:00,181,Good job guys!
66054,Mike the Pike,2007-04-30 10:51:00,3421, LOL Brian I know what skunk means this year.Believe me Ryan's line was in the water alot more than mine.I don't write about the snags tangles and mishaps from Ryan's line.Yes I would have liked to catch one for the team but this was his day not mine.  Next weekend is my weekend with the boys in Quinte so it will be my turn to contribute to team#4.  MTP
66067,Cast-Away,2007-04-30 11:44:00,790,What a great day out for you and your son Mike! There is nothing like time on the water with your kids. They will always remember it!

Glad you enjoyed your day and thanks for the post.  It was good to read.  Cheers,  Jen"
66401,GbayGiant,2007-05-01 04:35:00,1780,"Way to go Ryan, showed your old man how it's done.  Nice report Mike."

66436,bpsbassman,2007-05-01 12:01:00,941,What a great way to start my day! Great report and awesome pics. Way to go Ryan
66482,easton13th,2007-05-01 14:34:00,371,Great work guys! It's nice to see the success by the look on the faces!  Mike I will PM you with BOQ info!  Easton
66486,Bly,2007-05-01 14:50:00,1556,"Great report Mike!   Ryan, congratulations on your PB and for ""out fishing"" your dad     Sounds like it was a great day and that Ryan is a real trooper!!   Looking forward to getting our kids out this comming weekend.   Bly"
65901,Mike the Pike,2007-04-29 22:52:00,3421,Well Ryan and I had waited for over a month for the Opening of Trout season. We went to Lake Massawippi Quebec this was my first time here fishing.Really nice place.  When we got up mother nature was in a bad mood dumping plenty of rain for our day to come.  No problem we have rain gear.So we packed up ready to go.  This was Ryan's test to see if he could endure a day of trolling.This winter he was a true sport lasting all day ice fishing never wanting to go home.  I wasn't sure he would brave the elements Crappy weather  .The rain did not seem to faze him.  By the way guys and gals Ryan loves to read your fishing reports .Enough said time for the fishing report.     We got up before Lew o'clock and hit the road at 4:15am.     Ready to Launch 6am Ryan could not be happier   Ryan's prediction for the winning lure of the day.Hurry up Dad launch the boat   Ryan waiting for the fish!!!!!!!   The little man breaks the ice a 22 inch Laker 3lbs 2oz. Above the slot limit which is between 35cms and 50cms. Ryan could not seem to hang on to the fish so I just passed him the lip grip.   This is Ryan's PB biggest fish ever he is now out of the panfish stage.Here I am worrying if he will be able to net a fish for me and I am the net man who still has never caught a Lake trout.Boy those things are scrappy little buggers. The fish was caught suspended.we were in 66ft of water.   Caught on this little Rapala XRAP   Meanwhile I was using a Planer board and it seemed I was the only one on the Lake using them. Some other boat snagged my line because he didn't seem to see my board.I got spooled and I lost my only Lucky Craft lure $17.99 plus tax  The morron was towing my planer board and didn't bother to stop. Thankfully they float and  I went and retrieved the board. Ryan who is eight informed me that I should not use the Planers because he did not need them to catch Lakers.   The tinny boat live well.   This is serious Dad   Ryan wanted to drive the boat with the trolling motor on.       future boat owner.Hum?Tiller or Console?   Time to call it a day the bite was off and the boat traffic was brutal. A crowded opener but a great day Saturday.Back to the Launch.   The proud little man with his new PB catch.   Yes thats me holding my son's fish.Thats what we came here for to make him happy.     A view of Mont-Orford Ski resort there was plenty of snow remaining on the mountain.   Ryan snapped this picture of himself cheesy Dorito face on the phone telling mom that he caught dinner.   A great Day I got skunked but my little guy got his PB.  Now I am going to cook that trout.  Mike the Pike
