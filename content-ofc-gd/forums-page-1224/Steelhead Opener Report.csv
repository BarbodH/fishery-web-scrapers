65989,ccmtcanada,2007-04-30 01:50:00,7971, Hey there!  Too bad we didn't make the connection yesterday.  Hope you had a good opener...it was a pleasure meeting and chatting with you.  I heard you pulled one out of that spot we were both drifting.  Good job...I couldn't get them to sniff my bait...LOL.  Maybe we'll see you out there again!  Cliff
66010,ccmtcanada,2007-04-30 02:36:00,7971," Yeah...you gotta get up here soon!  We had a fun day out there that's for sure.  As for our team name ""Steel Eyes""....I like that better than ""Wall Heads""....LOL"

65805,fishnpro,2007-04-29 14:36:00,93,Nice job guuys. I though i recognized you from somewhere. I was the one who was fishing under the bridge for the most part and then I walk down to the pool that ccm was fishing. Did you guys end up goiing anywhere else?? right after you left that hole i managed to get a nice male from under the logs. Ill be back there today so I hope to see you around.
