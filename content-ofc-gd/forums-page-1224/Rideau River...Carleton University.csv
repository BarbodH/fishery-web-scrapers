Stared at that stretch again on Thursday while I was packing up #2 daughters immense collection (moved her into Res with a 5 foot truck box - toneau cover....out with a 6'-6"" and full cap + back seat!).  Looks like a good pickeral spot....very similar to the waters below Birch(sp) Rapids etc....any thoughts?"

Most of the bass are on the smaller side but theirs plenty of them, the muskies on the other hand can get to around 20 lbs. Caught one around that size 2 years ago below bronson bridge. They are really hard to catch though as they get pressured pretty heavily. Ive also seen very large carp below the bridge, but ive never really fished for them. Walleye are also abundant in some of the pools as well apparently although I have yet to every catch on yet."
