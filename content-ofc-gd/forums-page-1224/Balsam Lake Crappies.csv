66296,fishinfool,2007-04-30 23:12:00,366,"Got into a nice mess of Crappie on Sat morning, caught about 30 and threw back all but 11. Unfortunately there was about 10 boats in the area that I thought was my own little secret and when I went back just before dinner, they were all gone. I don't know if they were all caught or just got spooked and went out into deeper water!! They seemed to be very skittish even on Sat morn, if a boat came in or when your bobber hit the water they would take off. They weren't like that last year but then there wasn't as many boats either. The bite was extremely light this year by comparison, you really had to keep a close watch on your line and I probably lost 25 percent of the fish that did hit. Had a nice fish fry on Sat night, my kids love them in the beer batter that I do. Going back up this Sat to see if I can get some more. Crappie is my favorite fish to eat and beats the taste and texture of Walleye 3 to 1. If you haven't tried them, go get some, they are awesome.  Here's a pic of the stringer, some of them were actually quite large, 10 to 15 inches. The pic doesn't do them justice. But then again, a pic never does. "

66524,bbog,2007-05-01 15:39:00,665,"Nice haul, I'm hoping to improve on my dismal results from my opener quest. Maybe try again on Friday.  Mind if I asked what you were using (tubes or minnows?)."
66528,fliptheslop,2007-05-01 15:41:00,112,"I am not a big fan of eating fish, but I tell you if you think crappie are tasty try some bluegills and sunfish, tried some last year on a wim and boy they were good, I dont like astrong fishy taste, but both bluegills and sunfish I found very mild"
66550,bbog,2007-05-01 16:08:00,665,Just add a bit of original flavour Fish Crisp and all these delicate panfish are fantastic!!
66573,Smokey,2007-05-01 16:30:00,1278,Great job on the crappies. They look mighty tasty all ready just hanging there. Hope you enjoyed.
66595,lunkerbasshunter,2007-05-01 17:09:00,2585,nice!!! looks like a good meal will come from that!  cheers!
66597,Terry,2007-05-01 17:12:00,14456,I have caught just about every fish that balsam lake holds  but I have never caught a crappie there.......  I guess walleye and crappie don't hang out together
66692,nelly,2007-05-01 21:27:00,256,Nice looking decent slabs. Hopefully I will be able to find some this spring.
66695,huntervasili,2007-05-01 21:31:00,1604,MMM Crappie.... WTG out there
