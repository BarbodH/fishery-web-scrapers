66295,pikehunter,2007-04-30 23:09:00,1659,"If you are taking Plains Rd. from Burlington stay on it and it becomes York Bl. in Hamilton. (If you take the 403, exit at York Bl.) When you see Dundurn Castle on your left you are on the correct route, at the stop light veer to the left. Continue to follow York Bl. heading toward downtown. Before you get to Copps Colosseum turn left on Bay St. N.  Follow Bay St.  down to the harbour. You will pass Barton St. and then go over a bridge which crosses the CN Railway tracks. You will see Hutches then you will come to a 4way stop. This is the entrance to Pier4 Park. Turn left here and go down the hill and continue down around the curve and enter the boat ramp parking to your right.  Hope this wasn't too much detail."
