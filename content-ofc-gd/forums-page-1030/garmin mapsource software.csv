201793,pokerdemon4,2008-05-14 22:27:00,135,Just curious if any of you have downloaded garmin mapsource cartography off the net.  I have downloaded some and am able to view them on my pc but cant upload to my gps.
201797,Terry,2008-05-14 22:31:00,14456, of course I would never suggest that anyone use pirated software  but the bluewater maps (hydrographic) need unlock codes and they only work on the gps you register with canada topo and city maps can be copied and ran on any garmin gps
201803,pokerdemon4,2008-05-14 22:37:00,135,Thanks for the reply.  I have the topo.  I was just curious if the bluechart would work in a similar manner.  Thanks for the info.
202119,pokerdemon4,2008-05-15 14:12:00,135,I finally got it to work.  I can view the maps on my gps as well.  If anyone wants to know the links to the program and the garmin unlock utility let me know.
202307,mikeymikey,2008-05-15 19:35:00,376,"so you pirated a garmin softwares.  This thread should be deleted.  Let see how long it takes for such thread to be deleted before a lot more people get on board with garmin program crack.  If I pirated the softwares, I could have used that money to buy myself the highest end garmin gps."
