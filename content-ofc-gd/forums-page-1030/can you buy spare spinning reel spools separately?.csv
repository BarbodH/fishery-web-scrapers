The spare spools were in a bag of mine that was stolen, and I'm trying to figure out if it's possible to replace them.  Thanks, Mike"

202694,shane,2008-05-16 19:06:00,652,I think you generally can get replacement spools for better quality reels.  Probably any tackle shop that does repairs would be able to get you one.  Or you could have a look at this site http://www.reeldr.com/
202696,muskymike,2008-05-16 19:34:00,772,contact the manufacturer. you should be able to order directly from them. i know shimano does for sure. you can get any part of a reel directly from them.
202701,bassjnkie,2008-05-16 19:57:00,1101,Call Aiekmans they can deal with abu and quantum. 905-277-3595  Hope this helps Daniel
