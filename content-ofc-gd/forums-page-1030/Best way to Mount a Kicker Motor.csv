202535,Fishn Technishn,2008-05-16 03:53:00,198,OK I have narrowed down the kinds of kickers I want to look at.  What is the BEST way to mount it?  Am I better to get a long shaft motor and mount it directly to the transom? Or is it better to mount it on a Kicker Bracket. WHY? What are the advantages/disadvantages? I'm totally in unknown waters on this one!!  FT
202632,Blue_Axela,2008-05-16 14:05:00,88,I'm mounting my 2 stroke Merc 9.9 directly on my transom.  My Starcraft Starfire transom can handle it.
202636,Uncle Buck,2008-05-16 14:16:00,1000,"clamp it and bolt it to your transom...  if your transom can't handle the kicker on it, the kicker bracket will make it worse... there is a lot of moment on the kicker brackets...  get a long shaft regardless, ensures it no coming out of the water in waves..."

But, if a person had his hands on a short shaft at little or no cost and had a tight budget is there any way to use the kicker bracket effectively ?   My thinking is that the kicker bracket would allow me to use the short shaft motor for the time being."
202777,wallyboss,2008-05-17 01:55:00,1095,Rob V  I'll let you know shortly cause that is exactly what I will setup on my boat.
