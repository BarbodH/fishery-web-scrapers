202537,Cudz,2008-05-16 03:58:00,2652,I have a bit of a problem.  I don't know where to fish Saturday.  I have the use of 2 boats.  One big and one small. I was thinking cooks bay for pike.  Maybe couch for pike.  Then I thought about fishing little lake in barrie for walleye or maybe go jigging for some whitefish on simcoe.  What do you guys think? I booked this day off from my family months ago so I need to make the most of the day.
202546,e-z-out,2008-05-16 04:14:00,1052,Little lake in barrie is good for eyes and pike.
202548,wolfville,2008-05-16 04:34:00,396,Do them all if you can. They all sound good.
202567,Greencoachdog,2008-05-16 09:43:00,8163,It doesn't really matter where... just go!!!  Have fun and take lotsa pics!!!  Be keerful and Good Luck to ya!!!
202592,Stoty,2008-05-16 12:18:00,2910," Pike yes, but a lot of tiny ones. Walleye, not so much...apparently there are walleye in there, but I was talking to a guy that runs the bait shop there, and he said he hasnt seen any walleye come out of that lake in years.  Crappie fishing in there is good as well."
202596,ccmtcanada,2008-05-16 12:23:00,7971,Winds are supposed to be 25 to 30km/h on Saturday....so I'd probably go for the most wind friendly lake.
202627,BillM,2008-05-16 13:43:00,17367,"  Wow, I live about 5 mins from that lake and have never been on it  Looks like another place I need to check out."
202748,Cudz,2008-05-17 00:06:00,2652,Wow indeed. Wait until bass season.  You will not be disappointed.
202749,Cudz,2008-05-17 00:08:00,2652,Tons of those little snakes.  All small pike. The guy at the bait shop doesn't know what he is talking about.  That is all I am going to say.
202750,Canuck2fan,2008-05-17 00:18:00,1444,It all sounds good to me.... How can fishing not be a great day?
202752,fishindevil,2008-05-17 00:22:00,6254,"Do simcoe in the morning for whitefish & do the lake near barrie for walleyes & pike for the late afternoon bite until dark,the best of both worlds !!!!!....good luck and get out there...cheers"
