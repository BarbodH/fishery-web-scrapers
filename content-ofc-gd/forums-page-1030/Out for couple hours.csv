202893,bushart,2008-05-17 17:52:00,2628,tried this morning for a few willies before the weather moved in---no luck on them...but smallies were lurking about  tried jig/worm-jig/gulp minno-bottom bouncer spinner---and nuthin for eyes.  Caught a few smallies on a rocky point in 12 feet of water---  waited too long and got rained on---now I'm drying everything out  Was once again fishing with all my friends so I had to run the camera as well as hang onto the fish---the jump shot is neat but I was just lucky  The Bush Man
