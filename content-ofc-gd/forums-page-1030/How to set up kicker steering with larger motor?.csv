202685,misfish,2008-05-16 18:34:00,29133,"Nothing against what you bought,but if you want quality and longevity,S/S is the choice. IMO Like you said ""plated"",one scratch and the rust starts."
202807,ssminnow,2008-05-17 03:13:00,48, Your probably right.  The only reason I went with the plated one was because for my set up  I will need to bend the rod and in the reviews some one had suggested the stainless was difficult to bend into the shape you need.  If it wasn't for that fact I definitley would go stainless.  No doubt the first scratch will occur while bending.  Besides that though in general the bar and all the connectors seem pretty solid.
