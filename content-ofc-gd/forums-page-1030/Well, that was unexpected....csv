202757,kemper,2008-05-17 00:49:00,2232,"  Thats a first for me....a smallie on the pin!  Released unharmed right after a quick picture...little guy thought he was a trout!  Just though I would share, I know its OOS but was definately not targeted and not something you see often..."

202775,ehg,2008-05-17 01:44:00,2666,"It's that time of the year. Once all the waters open, bass and panfish, can be found way up tribs. My PB rock bass 13""+ was caught at headwaters of Saugeen when catching brook trout.  Haven't had walleye hitting topwaters, but have caught a few walleyes on spinnerbaits for bass.  Cool pic of center pin with the bass.  ehg"
