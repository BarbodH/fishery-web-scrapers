202789,iceguy,2008-05-17 02:32:00,341,Good day on the water solo.Lots of shakers and a few teens in the mix. Picked one nice 22 .02 on the hawg wild spin doc on the wire dipsey. Weigh her in at Bronte out doors fot the salmon classic derby. When he called it in we found out there was 24 pounder weigh in some where else. Had some trouble with the timer and the camera so I failed to get the whole fish in the pic.

202919,iceguy,2008-05-17 21:39:00,341,King on the wire...If I had some one with me I would got them to clear the rod and help me net it. Sure wouldn't have been so hectic. Loads of power in that fish.
