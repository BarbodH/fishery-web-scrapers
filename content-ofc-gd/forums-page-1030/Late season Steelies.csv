Water was slightly stained and the fish were a little scarce, I  managed to tie into a few!        I got this male in a bend in the river under a large overhanging tree.  Awesome fight!  He ran me downstream towards a nasty knockdown and I had to muscle him back upstream and walk him back up on shore.  I saw some in the shallows still spawning which surprised me a little but certainly better late than never.   I can't seem to load any more pics,  But pink worms were the only bait I had any action on.  Only regret was that I didn't buy more of them!!!   I am done till the fall for Steelhead.  Can't wait for the cool air and fresh CHROME!  Paul"

Try downsizing your pictures....or convert to .gif format.  You'll be able to attach more to your message that way.  Another way would be to upload your pics to www.photobucket.com and direct link them here.  If you want to try that way (and have the pics full size and in your posts), let me know....I can send some pics on how to do it.  Again, great job out there!"
