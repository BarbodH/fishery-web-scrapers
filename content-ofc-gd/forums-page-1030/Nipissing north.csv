203036,Muskieman,2008-05-18 14:49:00,2472,"North shore is tough fishing so far this weekend.... bad weather.  I just came home to dry off and will be returning to where i was last night   not on Nip.  while at Tim's about an hour ago  I spoke to a few friends of mine that just got back from the North shore and  only caught 4 and managed to keep three... not many people were catching yesterday or this morning.... small boats were getting tossed around, due to high winds rain and waves there weren't many boats out this morning.  I didn't do to well on my little lake for the same reasons... caught 7 kept 3... leaving to go back very soon. :Gonefishing:  Randy"

203041,kickingfrog,2008-05-18 15:45:00,8333,I was just checking the regs for Nipissing to make sure the tape measure that I had in my tackle box had the proper slot marked on it for the walleye. The new regs say the walleye slot for fish that had to be returned to the water in the new zone 11 (which Nipissing is in) is 43-60cm (16.9-23.6 in). It was 40-60cm last year was it not? No big legal deal for me and anybody using the old standard since they would be throwing back legal fish as opposed to keeping legal fish. Three cm is a big deal for some people.
203059,bassman,2008-05-18 18:44:00,384,Still 40-60cm. Read the exceptions.  Sorry
203077,Mike01,2008-05-18 19:59:00,378,"I was out on Saturday morning.  The weather was terrible and I didn't see anyone else catching fish.  I caught three walleye and had a pike follow all in Callander Bay.  Not the greatest day, but I couldn't wait to get out on the water."
