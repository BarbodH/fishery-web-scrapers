203058,Stoty,2008-05-18 18:42:00,2910,"I got up to the cottage last night to try my luck with some more Stoney Lake walleyes, and they co-operated pretty well, despite the cold front that moved in. All fish caught in 6-15 ft of water, snap jigging weedbeds.                      Heading out tomorrow to try my luck with Pike/Walleye near the BOQ. Hopefully they co-operate as well!  Cheers, *Stoty  (GO Team 9 GO)"

203070,tbayboy,2008-05-18 19:09:00,1497,Nicely done.
203071,007,2008-05-18 19:18:00,537,Congrats on the nice catch.  Looks like a successful day.  007
203084,Greencoachdog,2008-05-18 20:26:00,8163,"Nice report and pics!!!  Looks like 1 Walleye, 3 Pickeral, and 1 Perch to me!  You just need to measure and photo your largest Walleye for the tourney, and it will count until someone else catches a larger one on your team.  I see your team doesn't have a Panfish entry, you should've logo-ed that Perch... that's a pretty nice one!"
203086,mattyk,2008-05-18 20:30:00,2110,"some nice looking fish, thanks for sharing."
203089,Stoty,2008-05-18 20:57:00,2910,Thanks everyone! I hope I have the same luck tomorrow.  I did logo all the fish and sent them to my capitan. I just chose the best pictures for the thread.
203099,bassmaster4,2008-05-18 21:40:00,801,OMG THE WALLEYE ARE MAKING YOUR GLOVES BLUE!
203109,Clampet,2008-05-18 22:43:00,1947,You prolly caught more Walleye than most this week-end.
