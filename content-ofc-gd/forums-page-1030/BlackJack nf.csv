202838,Big Cliff,2008-05-17 10:53:00,6899,"Interesting!  But they are right, if you go to the casino and expect to make money playing blackjack you are a dreamer, you might win sometimes but you will loose in the long run. I spent a lot of time reading, learning, and practicing different playing and money management systems and stratigies. Even if you count cards it all really boils down to luck. You may be able to shift the edge slightly by counting but if your luck is bad, if the dealer is pulling 21 against your 20's or turning 16's into 21's all the card counting in the world isn't going to make you win.  Anyway, it was a good trainer in basic blackjack for someone who is thinking of going for an evening out at the casino."

202905,Dutch,2008-05-17 19:28:00,831,"Blackjack is a great game with deep roots in mathematics.  It is a skill game vs. a game of chance - you can significantly lower the houses' take by playing perfect basic strategy.  Add into that counting cards and you can actually tip the odds slightly in your favour, but when the casinos cut off 2+ decks of cards it makes it all that harder.  Walk away if they are using those automatic card shufflers unless you are playing basic strategy only.  Blackjack is one of the few casino games that you can really tip the odds slightly in your favour, under certain circumstances, to gain an edge.  Unlike what Cliff said above, in the long, long run you can actually come out ahead.  Learn the basic strategy...that is the first step."
202915,Big Cliff,2008-05-17 21:34:00,6899,"Just curious Dutch and no offence meant but do you make a living playing blackjack and if not, why not? As I said, I spent a lot of time studying, I can play perfect basic strategy, and have studied many, many money managment, and other stratagies but have found that in the long run it really depends on which way the cards are going. I have seen dealers make 21 after 21, after 21, I have seen times when the dealer bust every hand no matter what their up card was and I have seen times when the dealer's up card was a 5 or 6 and they make a hand every time. The Casinos are funded by people that think they can beat the house, the casinos seem to have lots of money.  I have played in several tournaments and even won a few and to be honest with you if I thought I could make $200.00 a day average playing blackjack in the casinos I wouldn't bother working, why would anyone?  I am really happy if you can do well at it; me, well I've had good days, I've had bad days, but no matter how well I play in the long run, the casinos always seem to come out on top.  I'd be really interested in talking with anyone that can show me I'm wrong and that you can make money in a casino over a long period of time. Perhaps we can share some knowledge and experience and all come out ahead."
202924,timmeh,2008-05-17 23:38:00,609,It is indeed possible to make money playing blackjack. Years ago a team of MIT students started a team of card counters who won large money. They were eventually caught and although they did nothing illegal they were banned from casinos. Several copycat groups have been formed since. How they did it was by having one guy playing average size bets and counting cards at the same time. When the count was favorable and the odds of winning were increased slightly the guy signaled in a high roller who bet the max for a while. In the long run they cleaned up. But it took lots of training. The guy who stared the team would make the players train everyday for 6 months before being aloud to step foot in the casino. But i agree that the average person would most likely be dependent on luck.
202966,pikehunter,2008-05-18 02:27:00,1659,"Only one way to win at the casino, go be entertained by watching the losers, bring enough money for the buffet and leave all debit cards, credit cards and remaining cash at home!  It would be a miracle if anyone can actually effectively count cards at BJ. Eight decks with 2 not dealt out from the shoe makes it next to impossible. Then if you are on a table with the continuous shuffler forget it. Impossible. If you want to believe anything differently you are certainly welcome to think what you want but remember you are just another sucker for the casino.  The only hope to increase your percentage is to follow the strategy by the book, and hope and pray that the rest of the players are following the same set of strategic laws.  Been there done that, got the watch to prove it.  Have fun but don't think you have a hope in h3ll that you will break the bank."
