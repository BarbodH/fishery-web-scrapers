I have an acreage with nice sandy soil, that I would like to use a geothermal heating systen for heating a planned 1400 sq. ft. house to be built. I am sold on the idea but have heard that it cannot be done in an off the grid situation. This puzzles me and I am hoping that there is now some type of low voltage/amperage geothermal system out there that is made for this purpose. Ideally I would use a solar/wind system to provide power with a generator of some type as backup. Heat could be a wood furnace, but I am still looking at what else is out there.  I welcome comments and ideas.  Thanks for taking a peek.  outdoorguy61"

The systems only last for so long before they have to be redone.  I was talking to a guy at work yesterday who is now heating his pool with a solar type system.  The sun heats up water in a black barrel and the heat is transferred to the pool.   forrest"
