Moved further down inside the channel and managed 10 keepers, a sheephead and a rock bass. Perch came in 5 minute feeding spurts then quit for hours at a time. Dennis also hooked a nice carp probably 15lbs but we had no way of getting it up at the spot we were.  7 of the perch were true jumbos, the other 3 real keepers. No dinks today.  Anyway, just thought I'd give a heads up on the action for those planning to try this weekend."
