203163,Joey,2008-05-19 02:29:00,9122,"Read this in the Richmond Hill Liberal  Thornhill Men Plead Guilty to Fishing Violations  What struck me funny was the last sentence.  ""Both men have also been banned from possessing a fishing licence for one year, were placed on probation and must not commit similar violations for two years.""  So after two years, its okay to commit similar violations?  Joey"
203181,Musky or Specks,2008-05-19 02:56:00,2710,I like the fines but the ban on having a fishing licence thats about as effective as the ban on drunk drivers not being able to have a drivers licence. In other words not effective at all unless they are checked for them and with the amount of CO.s out there what do you think the chances are. How many times do you think they did this before they were actually caught?
