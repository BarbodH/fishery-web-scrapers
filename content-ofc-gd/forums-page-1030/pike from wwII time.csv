202935,ccmtcanada,2008-05-18 01:21:00,7971, I did write one Glen!  Put it up this afternoon.  Carole and our oldest are out at the carp spot though...she has one so far....hopefully they get into more before the night is out....
202967,maybe,2008-05-18 02:28:00,307,"Uhm...Glen...you might wanna apologize to bassmaster4 for callin him a girl.  As for reports from me, don't hold your breath.  Jeff's been picking the spots, and his internal radar seems to be stuck on ""OOS bass and 6 inch perch.""  Can you really call it a mutiny if there's only 2 of you on the boat?"
