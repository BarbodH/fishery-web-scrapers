I named it ""SPIKE"".. yikes! It originates from western Africa. Keep it in damp mulch & warm. You keep a hideout in the tank where it can feel secure & dark. The venom is equal to a nasty bee-sting..but I aint about to test it!"
202566,Greencoachdog,2008-05-16 09:40:00,8163,Dammit Man!!!  Those things are absolutely disgusting!!! The only way I'd handle one is with a garden hose to spray it off the bottom of my boot!  Prolly make a fine Catfish bait though!  Enjoy your new pet Bubba!

I also got an adult one of these yesterday, too...  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K61Cv2e04x4  He's friendly & cute..just like me! You pick it up about a foot from the tail. It wraps around yer arm pretty tight. Sorta like a semi-firm handshake. Its all muscle & you kinda let it go/do what it wants in your hands. They originate from northern Mexico. It eats one adult mouse/week & I keep it in a 30 gallon tank with a super-secured lid..  At least they don't bark....I named the snake ""Cuddles""..."
