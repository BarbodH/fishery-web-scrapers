203378,Photoz,2008-05-19 20:22:00,792,For a cute wee guy he sure has some formidible weaponry on his feet . . . .     could ALREADY do serious damage without growin' up!
203394,blaque,2008-05-19 21:02:00,2419,He sure looks reluctant to let his guard down lol. Might be that doggie or whatever is under the trailer that has him trying to stay on the lookout. Just put your head down and get on with the nap little one lol
