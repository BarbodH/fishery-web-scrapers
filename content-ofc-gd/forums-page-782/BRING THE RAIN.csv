Today just might be that day. 70% chance of rain and up to 15mm. Maybe a little more later in the week and GAME ON!!!  Sure when temp. starts to drop and summer is ending we all feel like warm weather is far far away but when the walleye, smallies and trout bite picks up, it's all in the balance!"

387665,laszlo,2009-09-28 14:54:00,487,Just finished raining hard here in Etobicoke. Finally!!! Give it a day or two and let the fun begin.  Hopefully the holes I fished (in the river) in the spring that dwindled down are back to the trusty spots that produced schools of fish.
