Unfortunately, in my neck of the woods it's just ridiculous. Ditto for pretty much all of the States I've visited."
388236,anders,2009-09-29 18:06:00,1168,Yeah the garden...im sure some of the Sault boys can tell stories about that place...ive just heard and only seen it on the calm side of things
388237,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-09-29 18:11:00,0," MPP's are who you want to talk to as they handle the MNR.  Here in the north we have some pretty good MPP's who generally are in touch with forestry, natural resources etc. Unfortunately bozos from down south treat our natural resources purely as a source of revenue, not as the ecological cornerstone of our very existence.  We have been battling various governments over issues like the spring bear hunt or remote access tourism for years yet the same two groups of bozos are continually given the reins to our precious resources.  Vote responsibly.  Get to know your local politicians and ask them questions about our resources before you throw your vote behind them.  If you normally vote conservative ask them why they cancelled the spring bear hunt!  If you normally vote liberal, ask them why enforcement dollars have been depleted to the point that CO's can't afford gas for their vehicles.  If you normally vote NDP ask them why they blindly support the forest industry without acknowledging that forestry communities must diversify their industries in order to survive.  Seeking the answers to these tough questions will force our politicians to regard natural resources as something more than a way to pad the public coffers."
388238,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-09-29 18:13:00,0, I went to mile 11 on the garden 10 years ago and there was no less than 50 cars parked up there... 5th wheels and RV's from michigan towed way into the backcountry on a BAD road...  Yanks and southern ontario boys filling garbage bags with half rotten salmon...It's a circus for sure.
388239,ch312,2009-09-29 18:16:00,1590,"man...you guys sound like a bunch of whiny women in every salmon related thread.   heres an idea...  instead of filling the board with useless posts crying about how bob or chuck catch salmon why not use that energy for something useful. write letters, make phone calls, educate, and make people aware of the problem. crying on an internet forum and flaming other members will help solve nothing"
388240,anders,2009-09-29 18:18:00,1168, That and speckled trout creek in the spring for steelhead...its a joke...
388244,gogu392,2009-09-29 18:42:00,142,"heres another idea...  Let them eat those fish from Ontario. The ""no english"" guy like the soup from salmon organs. That is one of the ""best PCB soup"". The PCB and other contaminats will do the job. The mother nature take care of everything, allways.  Have fun."

He can cross and snag all those wrongdoers lines, reel 'em in, cut 'em and defy the guys working them to do anything about it. If they try to reload he just bounces the spoon off them (or into them) a time or two. That would be better than any scrawny little MNR dudes in flak jackets.  JF"

388049,JohnF,2009-09-29 02:15:00,3494," Well, because presumably they're trained in their use in pressure situations.   You need people who are trained in handling criminals and who realize they could easily cross the line to be criminals themselves.   You're right, but with people who are trained to handle difficult situations, not rookies with a gun who might just shoot first and ask questions later.  I've seen what happens when you send rookies into a pressure situation. I got caught up (seriously) in both the Grand Bend riots, and was in the middle of a National Guard callout at a Watkins Glen Grand Prix. The uniforms didn't cover themselves in glory in any of those. How can we expect a bunch of gun totin' yahoos off the street to do any better? Solo's right. Leave the guns to the trained LEO's. Heaven knows they're scary enuf armed. Giving guns to amateurs, no matter how good they are with weapons, is asking for trouble.  Respectfully JF"
388051,solopaddler,2009-09-29 02:16:00,8605,  Ummm...I assumed the sarcasm was obvious.
388054,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-09-29 02:20:00,0,"  The fish and wildlife guardian certification was by no means an enforcement tool.  I took the certification and what it was meant for was public knowledge and eyes on the ground.  You had no right to actually approach a violator other than to inform them they were breaking the law.  You did not issue tickets and you did not really have ANY enforcement right whatsoever.  Essentially all you could do was notify the mnr, something the MNR tip line can do all the same...and you don't have to pay to take a course to do that."
388059,Burtess,2009-09-29 02:25:00,901," Yes, this is correct, but you did have more of a direct line to a Conservation Officer from what I understand.  And I believe the training was on what the proper laws were and what pertinent information you needed to collect to support the CO's enforcement.  Burt"
388072,bigfish1965,2009-09-29 02:48:00,3382, I was in that...the letter I got from the MNR said it was cancelled because of a lack of interest.
388073,bigfish1965,2009-09-29 02:51:00,3382, Yes..that much is true. I had the local CO's cell number and we met once a month. It is a shame they got rid of us.
388075,BillM,2009-09-29 03:05:00,17367,"Man, I would drive down to Barrie just to nail all those guys....  Would be nice if the MNR started it back up."

The only thing we can do is call the tips hotline or contact the mnr directly and hope for a CO to show up and scare them all away.

388133,capt bruce,2009-09-29 13:24:00,820,"I think it's about time the mnr relizes they dont have the reasorces to deal with the snaggers , so WHY NOT JUST CLOSE DOWN THE SEASON DURING the run ????? What real angler wants to catch , black half dead spawning fish , this will put a end to all the do they bite etc. debates , the things I see on the peirs this time of year reminds me of the bears in B.C. lineing the sides of rivers during the run, just close the rivers untill the end of OCT. ???"
388136,canadadude,2009-09-29 13:30:00,769,"I like this idea, but like I said in another thread, this should be like Christmas for the CO's with all the violations going on there's tons of fine $$$$$$$$ to be had.

388148,BillM,2009-09-29 14:14:00,17367,"  Yup, it's easy pickings..  Maybe someone should make the government of Ontario aware of the potential earnings with all the fines given   I'm sure the rivers would belined with CO's then."

Just a beauty.  Would have said something (in vain im sure) but I had my girlfriend with me and didnt need an altercation"
388214,craigdritchie,2009-09-29 16:58:00,1586,"Closing the season or designating the area as a fish sanctuary will accomplish nothing. These morons are already breaking a bunch of laws by blatantly snagging fish and tossing them in the bushes. Does anyone really think a closed season would deter them one bit? Every single night you can find gangs of idiots blatantly snagging or netting fish out of the existing sanctuaries on the Credit and Bronte. Laws mean nothing to these yahoos.  If I didn't enjoy the lake fishery so much, I'd be all in favour of eradicating salmon altogether. It doesn't matter where you travel around the Great Lakes - anywhere there is a salmon run, you have this kind of hooligan act. It's completely sickening."

It could be because we move to hunting, or back to walleye....however when it comes to moose, this area has a very poor reputation  Just my .02  Anders"

Females, males, a couple coho..... saw a guy pull one out (hooked in the belly) and it already had a hook in its back and one in the tail.  When told he couldn't keep the fish, he of course took the ""no speak English"" excuse.... I said ""Bull"" and put my finger in my cheek like a hook and shook my head.  He put it back.

I drove down from Windsor on Saturday to take a look at the conditions since the area did get some rain. As I was pulling into the parking lot, I saw a Police Marine Unit Car parked there. This gave me at least some hope that at least for a few hours it might keep these goons from raping the resources.  I didn’t see the cops they must have been on the river either fishing or taking care of some business, but hopefully there presence did some good. Even if they were just fishing themselves I think the car in the parking lot would make a lot of these guys change there mind."
