In various threads I have seen pictures of the work they have done and I am asking to see it again here in this Replica Specific thread. I am going for a basic wood mount like the Walleye mount I seen on here, and I asked if I can have the exact same scratched up Rapala Skitter pop mounted into the same position as where it was hooked(as seen in the photographs).  This is something that I need to have done for myself and the face that I can pay 50% down and make some smaller monthly payments is great.  Share your stories and pictures of fish that have been created on a  replica mount basis(doesnt need to be A.T. specific company)   Thanks, MTBF"
387561,BillM,2009-09-27 21:16:00,17367,I'd personally save the pics and get a replica done when you can afford it.
387586,Radnine,2009-09-27 22:14:00,1538,I have no story to relay about replicas etc. but am thrilled that you are pursuing it. You will have something to talk about for the rest of your life. Good luck and let us know how you make out. Jim
387596,SRT8 smoker craft,2009-09-28 04:52:00,1107,I would be curious as to the price I have 2 LMB that are a touch lighter than yours that I have been considering getting a replica made of both with the 2 of them chaseing a few blue gills but I'm scared to know what it would cost feel free to PM if you don't want to put it on here .
387733,gone_fishin,2009-09-28 16:57:00,481, you can send them an e-mail and ask for a quote... send the picture as an attachment to the e-mail...  they quoted the walleye in my avatar  at $625... the measurements for that were 32 inch length and 22 inch girth.
387819,SRT8 smoker craft,2009-09-28 20:01:00,1107,Thanks for the PM mike and GF I will e-mail them but looks like I'm going to be saving for awhile because I have 4 fish 2 bass and 2 bluegills 1 bass is 6.5 lbs and the other is 6.69 lbs prolly looking at a grand or more. Thanks again guys.
387822,MCTFisher9120,2009-09-28 20:03:00,3761, would u show me a pic of those 2 big bass?
387829,Victor,2009-09-28 20:15:00,1609," I second that. As I'm also a student right now, I'd say, it's not really a great idea to have to put down so much $ + monthly payment of something that you don't absolutely need at the moment. You have the measurements & pics, so you can always get it done later."
387889,gone_fishin,2009-09-28 22:45:00,481,"i also agree with the other statements, you should wait until you can afford it... i know, you want it NOW!!! but think about all the fishing gear that you could buy with that money!!! LOL.  i will definitely get a mount of that walleye done at some point, but not yet... right now, i still get a warm fuzzy feeling inside every time i look at the pictures of that fish (and that was back in February). like i said, i will get the mount done, but only when i can burn that amount of money"
387892,MCTFisher9120,2009-09-28 22:49:00,3761," UhOh, now I'm getting the feeling of not getting it done at the moment lol. If the parents are helping me out I can't see why not, however 1 more rod/reel + line for the 4 or 5 rods + some new tackle would add up but that's what Christmas and B-Day money is for.  I want to talk to the man about the service and if I feel I'm doing the correct thing then I'll move forward with it."
