I've been fishing mostly urban areas around mississauga and the gta and for the most part i've targeted bass. I'm now living in London for the next two years and hope to get some fishing done soon in the area. I'm looking forward to contributing to the forum, which has been a great resource for me Here's a couple of pics from the summer..  A smallmouth   A small carp   Cheers, Julio"
