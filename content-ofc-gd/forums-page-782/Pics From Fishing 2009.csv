387227,laszlo,2009-09-26 12:31:00,487,"Still some fishing to go for me this season but my trips up north are done and some rivers I fish will be closed next week for the year.      Biggest Walleye - 24.5""        Largest Largemouth Bass - 19""    Biggest Pike - 28""                    Largest River Smallie of The Year    Largest Smallmouth Bass - 19.5""     Nothing really huge this season but great numbers. Maybe my best since I was a teenager. The smallmouth bass fishing was unreal this year. Usually I target Largemouth but couldn't get enough of the smallies.  Regardless, a lot of time in the outdoors loving every moment.  Hope you enjoyed...  Laz"

387235,Rich Clemens,2009-09-26 12:56:00,3131,"Maybe nothing huge Laz, but some very respectable fish there none-the-less"
387237,laszlo,2009-09-26 13:00:00,487," Thanks Rich, but the mighty Musky found a way to avoid me once again. I guess that's what fishing is all about.  Next year..."
387249,johnnyb,2009-09-26 13:57:00,3413,Great post man....looks like a fantastic season
387255,Skud,2009-09-26 14:32:00,739,Great pictures. Thanks for sharing. Looks like we both need a mini tripod for the self portraits. lol
387262,laszlo,2009-09-26 15:04:00,487," Your bang on there. Seems my wife Anna only has the tolerance to be fishing with me about 1% of the time. Then there's my fishing protege Andrew, her younger brother, who can't be ripped away from time playing hockey and golf.  Then there's my dog Ida who can't be trained to take a good picture if her life depended on it."
387279,fishindude,2009-09-26 16:05:00,220,"great stuff! looks like some really good smallie action for you this year time to give the river smallies a few more tries before it starts to get real cold  thanks for the photos,  fishindude"
387300,oates,2009-09-26 18:14:00,151,"Yup, good times. Hey, Oct. might top them all! Not over yet!"
387322,laszlo,2009-09-26 19:52:00,487," Still haven't gotten a smallie out of the river over 17"". If this happens in October, that would be the perfect way to finish the bass season. Well...there's also November but my modivation to wade decreases majorly."
