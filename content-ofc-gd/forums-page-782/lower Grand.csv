388087,west lake charlie,2009-09-29 05:07:00,40,"I just closed up my trailer and brought my boat home to Brantford.  Promised a buddy I'd take him out this weekend. The Weather looks like crap for the weekend, but I think we are not going to let that stop  us. Anyways, Just wondering if anybody has any updates on the lower grand, and maybe any input for safe boating down there, so I Don't rip the bottom end off my motor! Is there a large fall Walleye run like the Bay of Quinte? When is the best time to target the big chanel cats?  Thanks guys"
