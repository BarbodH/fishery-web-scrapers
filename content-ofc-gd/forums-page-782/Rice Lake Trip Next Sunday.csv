I'm looking forward to meeting up with people from this board.  I have a question about Boat Rentals.  I am coming from Brantford, so it is a fairly long drive.  Can anyone recommend a good place to rent a 14ft tinner for the day.  Let me know, and if anyone else wants to come, the more the merrier!  Thanks!"
387039,CrankbaitJon,2009-09-25 19:45:00,13,I rented at Bewdley before.  I don't remember exactly the name or the phone # as I lost their business card.  The boats were the cleanest I've rented.  I remember their logo is like a red stop sign with some numbers in it.  Jon
387040,ADB,2009-09-25 19:47:00,444,"Best place I've been to is Plank Road Marina in Gore's Landing.  Nice people, great service.  They'll give you a free map as well.  Their price last time I was there was like $70 all-in for the day.  http://www.plankroadcottages.com/marina.html"
387043,Jet,2009-09-25 19:52:00,364,Second Plank Road. They are really great and don't gouge you on gas like some places. They charge $10 for the full tank before you leave. Instead of charging you for what you use when you get back which mysteriously always seems to be $15 - $25 at other places even though the tank is still almost full.
387102,hirk,2009-09-25 22:54:00,571,"I highly recommend BJ's Tackle,you can leave at the crack of dawn and fish till dark.Good rates & boats. 905-797-2632 Ask for Ben"

387718,ra95,2009-09-28 16:30:00,49,"Comparing the quality of the motor and the price, you will love wisperingpines. PlankRoad cottage's boat's motor is not good unless you have a very very strong arm"
387719,ra95,2009-09-28 16:33:00,49,"BTW, 14' foot 15 HP with battery start, price $68 (It has included gas and tax already). Even BJ cannot beat this price, not to mention Plank Road."
387721,[email protected],2009-09-28 16:35:00,290,  Its listed as $75 on their site (although an extra $7 isnt really anything to complain about  )
387724,frozen-fire,2009-09-28 16:42:00,542,I second whispering pines... Roger is a great guy and prices are very decent.
388176,[email protected],2009-09-29 15:25:00,290,Well I booked at Whispering Pines.  Now all I need to do is find out where the heck to fish!  Has anyone been out there this past weekend? Is the bite on?
