386788,Greencoachdog,2009-09-25 03:19:00,8163,"  Half ton???... isn't that a 150?... I was always under the impression that F 150's were for wives, daughters, and ""Rainbow Flag Boys""!  ... the3/4 Super Duty 24 valve Flex Fuel 5.4 will stomp and mudhole in your  and walk it dry!!!... you and wayne should really try to upgrade to a more manly vehicle... I'm serious!  ... unless y'all are taking warm showers together in the wee hours of the morning..."
386820,canadadude,2009-09-25 08:21:00,769,"That is one of the best motors on the market today, should provide plenty of power for the truck. Sounds like a pretty sweet rig"
386954,Guest steel'n'esox,2009-09-25 16:28:00,0,"  Or the bumper would fall off the frame and be laying on the ground with hitch and chain intact, if it was the mighty Mopar you would pull the tree out of the ground by the roots and have a cord of fire wood to boot"

I smoked a Vette last week.    what did ya charge him...cuz he took 500 bucks from me last week to fix my puppy?  twisted sense of humour i know ...but i couldnt resist..."
387045,Dara,2009-09-25 19:57:00,3052, It wasn't much of a vette You gotta drive a 5.7 to know
387046,Dara,2009-09-25 19:57:00,3052,  thats ok  (pats you on the head)
387059,misfish,2009-09-25 20:52:00,29133,"Can you amagin if a Tundra tried that?   FORD, built tough."
387260,Tybo,2009-09-26 14:50:00,1373,Too funny. Most of thees tug of wars are done wrong. If you don't load up the torque converts first. The truck that tugs first will win. The guy that was slower converter will stall and never be able to catch up.  One thing I like about fords. Is they where nice enough to circle the problem.
387261,kickingfrog,2009-09-26 15:01:00,8333,A urinating contest about vehicles. Oh so original. Yawn.    Thanks for the tip Irish. I'm sure that will help someone out someday.
387483,aplumma,2009-09-27 13:50:00,6896,  I have seen the dawgs truck and it is nice ...except for the loose nut behind the steering wheel.    Art  The Titan owner

387492,Bernie,2009-09-27 15:02:00,3190,"Careful about attaching those to a tree. Those things can seize in solid. A torch and a sledgehammer are sometimes the only solution   .  Those 5.4 engines are one of the best on the market. Fair torque and horsepower too. The 4.6 came out in the early 90's and many of the Ford engines are based on it. I have never had one of my customers engines based on those have a  major failure. As a matter of fact the only time I even had a valve cover off of one was a rocker broke on a Marquis 4.6. That was several years ago and the car was poorly maintained by the customer. Once in a while a high miler 5.4 will seep oil between the head gasket and the block but haven't had one yet that was serious enough to need to pull apart. The Dodge pickup gas engines also seem to be reliable in the last few years, too bad about the rest of the truck."
387493,Dara,2009-09-27 15:08:00,3052,  Yeah..thats the one...was it you?
387524,irishfield,2009-09-27 17:41:00,26272, Note the short chain Bernie! I didn't yank it.. I just drove away.
387650,corvette1,2009-09-28 14:02:00,1765,don't know what year corvette that it was but my 05 has 400hp and the only smoking you would be doing is breathing my tire smoke
387697,Sebastian,2009-09-28 16:00:00,208," Honda is the reason why Ford is on life support. Cars, fishing gear, you name it......Japs Rule."
387812,Dara,2009-09-28 19:46:00,3052,"  It wasn't no 400hp one, and my Toyota has 381 (it was a cheapo 80's vette)    Ford isn't on life support. They are doing just fine on their own. I would take a Ford over my Toyota right now. Not that there is anything wrong with it, but there is nothing wrong with a Ford either. It comes down to looks between them 2 as far as i'm concerned."
386689,irishfield,2009-09-24 23:16:00,26272,Someone asked this earlier this year. I was dumb and left mine in all summer... so here's a picture to show you how. Spray penetrating oil if you have it and then chain to tree and drive away. Note... use a neighbours tree if you can... as it's hard on the bark!
386690,Terry,2009-09-24 23:20:00,14456,ouch  you ripped it off  did you know you have 3 balls
386692,irishfield,2009-09-24 23:27:00,26272,One of each size... always be prepared for the variance in recipients.....

386697,GBW,2009-09-24 23:40:00,8460,looks like your balls are hurting
386702,Roy,2009-09-24 23:59:00,13728,"If you're not gunna be needing your balls anymore, you can wrap a slingshot  around your neighbour's front axle, wrap the the other end to your un-needed balls then drive away. The priceless part is when your neighbour sees your balls go right through his rad."
386707,JohnF,2009-09-25 00:12:00,3494, And they're rusty - seriously rusty.  JF
386709,Spiel,2009-09-25 00:18:00,9065,"Can't be a Ford, you'd still be chained to the tree."
386723,Cast-Away,2009-09-25 00:37:00,790,"Wayne, does Leah know that you got hitched again? Are you from Utah?"
386735,Greencoachdog,2009-09-25 00:57:00,8163,If you have an F250 Super duty with a 24 valve Triton 5.4.. you'll never have a stuck hitch!!!
386737,danbouck,2009-09-25 01:03:00,4380, Ya because you know there is no sense installing a hitch when the trucks just gonna break down on ya
386738,Dara,2009-09-25 01:04:00,3052,  the little 300hp rig eh   hey Wayne...grease up them balls eh  nice trick though...
386744,Greencoachdog,2009-09-25 01:16:00,8163,"  Do a little google search on the Ford 5.4L engine son.. the most reliable engine around, bar none!!!   Yes, I know you have Ford envy... you should go to a dealership for your cure eh!?"
386749,Twocoda,2009-09-25 01:47:00,4130,   he he he
386750,2 tone z71,2009-09-25 01:48:00,1311,"  I love Fords but the 5.4 is gutless, the base engine in any Super Duty should be the Diesel now your playing with power,the 5.4 it has a hard time moving a half ton around let alone a real truck"
386753,Twocoda,2009-09-25 01:51:00,4130,  like this one?
386754,Dara,2009-09-25 02:00:00,3052,With those pulls It doesn't have much to do with anything but traction. I had a ford with a 5.4 and it had plenty of power. I now have a Tundra with a 5.7 There is a bit of a difference. I smoked a Vette last week.
386759,Greencoachdog,2009-09-25 02:11:00,8163,"  ... another victim of ""Blue Oval"" envy... you should seek counseling!!!"
