386897,wask,2009-09-25 14:48:00,174,"I understand the fear of abusers, but in the end, not naming it on OFC probably isn't going to make a big difference.  I like the idea of knowing what body of water certain fish are caught in.  In fact, I'm still relatively new in Canada and this board has been a big help.  I think too it's important that if I want to disclose a body of water I fish on that i should be able to.  For instance, I posted a report about Long Lake in Apsley a few weeks ago.  Got a message from another member on here about how they went canoeing there after reading my report, caught some fish and had a great day.  That's one of the great features about this board.  That being said, I'm not going to give you the GPS coordinates of where I caught the fish, or the exact structure I was fishing or anything like that.  I'm also not willing to give up the smaller water I fish and the honey holes that are on it where I know I can catch fish most of the time.  (I have found it hilarious to see guys post pics, especially of carp, and photoshop the background out, I know why they do it, but still cracks me up)  Just my .02, not trying to give you a hard time..."

387274,Dabluz,2009-09-26 15:53:00,701,"I live in a region that is littered with small lakes.  Yes, when a lake is good, the word does get around and the fishing pressure increases.  However, after a while, the fishing is not so good and the lake is no longer as popular and the fish in the lake are left alone for a few years.  Then, the fishing gets good again.  It's impossible to catch all the fish in a lake.  My best fishing spots are close to town.  They are usually hard to fish and maybe the number of fish is low but the fish are much larger on the average.  Sure, there are people who see me fishing in one of these lakes and this attracts fishermen but then there is always the fact that 10% of the fishermen catch 90% of the fish.  Keeping a spot really secret means that no one....not even your best buddy or brother or anyone else in the family knows where you are fishing.  That's pretty hard to do."
387301,JohnF,2009-09-26 18:21:00,3494,"When I refer to the Thames I'm talking about water that may be only 15' wide in spots and seldom deeper than 2', but it runs for many many miles through a lot of towns and even counties. It's not too hard to figure out the spots that are popular by the trampled grass on the shoreline but even shorefishing is often not an option. The nettles and now that poisonous stuff (sow weed?) are pretty good deterrents to all but the most hard core.  Frankly the spots I like are generally only accessible to waders and I haven't seen many folks on the Thames willing to wet their dainty toes, so even if I spilled the beans (no offense, Beans) it probably wouldn't hurt the spot much. All I have to do is to remember to mention the snapping turkles and the humongous leechs to keep most waders away.  The few good secrets I have shared have resulted in pretty happy fisherpersons, which I like to see. In fact in several cases they proved the site was even better than I'd thought, which gave me added enthusiasm to get back there and try it again, or try it diferently.  Obviously I don't agree that we need to be more secretive generally, but I can sympathize with the folks who want to protect their good spots in the busier urban areas. It's hard, even impossible, to satisfy everyone all the time.  I for one like the little hints that get thrown out. It makes me more aware as I'm travelling through new areas. I'm always wondering if that's the bridge so and so caught all those fish under.  JF"

387464,LucG,2009-09-27 12:32:00,779,"I've been thinking about that quite a bit after one of my last reports. I doubt this is anything the board would want to start enforfing, but it might be in our best interest to leave out location information."
387466,tdotfisherman,2009-09-27 12:47:00,317,"For me this whole issue is a catch 22 situation. I live in Toronto, and fish both around Lake Ontario, but also quite a bit on Georgian Bay and the North Bay region. I find it extremely annoying when people post fishing reports and neglect to say where abouts they were fishing. How do we know that these fish were even caught in Ontario? At least give us a region or something.. it makes the repots a lot more interesting. But on the other hand I do understand that blurring out backgrounds and not being too specific with urban spots is probably the right thing to do. I've noticed a lot of new people at some of the GTA spots that I fish in the last year or two, and in talking to them I realized they were lurkers that picked up information by snooping on forums like this one. They jacked the spots off the internet, and even used lures that they saw in the photos that were posted on fishing boards. I feel that if I had to spend a few years doing legwork on spots and productive lures, so should they. Anyways, this isn't really that big of an issue to me anymore, becasue I have a boat, and rarely shore fish around Toronto anymore, but I still do feel for the shore anglers that have to compete for a few good spots."

387972,misfish,2009-09-29 00:19:00,29133,"  Since Im not all that smart,I looked it up,,,,  Godwin's Law (also known as Godwin's Rule of Nazi Analogies)[1] is a humorous observation made by Mike Godwin in 1990 which has become an Internet adage. It states: ""As a Usenet discussion grows longer, the probability of a comparison involving Nazis or Hitler approaches 1.""[2][3]  Godwin's Law is often cited in online discussions as a deterrent against the use of arguments in the widespread reductio ad Hitlerum form. The rule does not make any statement about whether any particular reference or comparison to Adolf Hitler or the Nazis might be appropriate, but only asserts that the likelihood of such a reference or comparison arising increases as the discussion progresses. It is precisely because such a comparison or reference may sometimes be appropriate, Godwin has argued,[4] that overuse of Nazi and Hitler comparisons should be avoided, because it robs the valid comparisons of their impact.  Although in one of its early forms Godwin's Law referred specifically to Usenet newsgroup discussions,[5] the law is now applied to any threaded online discussion: electronic mailing lists, message boards, chat rooms, and more recently blog comment threads, wiki talk pages, and Twitter.  I think I understand."
388101,12footspringbok,2009-09-29 11:31:00,459,Sorry i got on this one a little late. I don't think its all that big a deal to post a general area like some others have already mentioned. However posting a specific spot where the fishing is very good or the fish are vulnerable to over fishing its never good. I personally think that generally the type of anglers that are going to try a specific spot because they heard it was good or because so and so on the internet catches lots there all the time are the type of angler that are going to be easily discouraged because they don't have a clue what they are doing in the first place. Anyways just a couple of my thoughts....

Who feels that fishing reports done on this board should not mention the body of water and keep it just about fish caught and so on??? I myself have mentioned where I fished in the past but lately have decided not to. Personal messeges seem like the right way to go with this reducing the mass amounts of people getting access to spots, members and lurkers. I think this should apply regardless if the body of water is already popular or not. A heavily fished area will just become even more heavily fished.

Never mind the larger Kawartha lakes, Simcoe, etc.  I understand the need to keep ""secret spots"" confidential, but if I want to post a report about some fish I catch on my home lake, which is a rather large and popular lake.

I don't think this would make the board bland at all. For me, veiwing reports with pics and a story is good enough. The location itself isn't all that important to me.  The reason I brought this up was influenced by a few fishing buddies I have. They don't really use the internet that much and don't know about OFC. To all that I mentioned OFC to, it seemed their first reaction was negative, mentioning that it would seem that sort of thing would be bad for the fisheries. They have a point."

There were way more reports shared a couple of years ago, didn't seem to be detrimental to any fisheries. After many years of seeing this and sharing some, it seems most folks use the right discretion without having to be constantly bantered at, or ruled. It is not like directions and waypoints are being shared like on some more viewed TV shows.  The public nature and lack of 'exclusivity' helps all on this forum.

Posting bogus hot spots would only discredit your character and this forum ...this is the information age and if someone applies them selves...they can easily find hotspots without ever taking a step along the waters edge but that doesnt mean they will catch fish IF they are still in that spot on any given day.
