With the wind having whipped things up pretty bad, I decided to try for a decent Pike I was sight fishing to yesterday from shore.  Yesterday, it had stuck its snout right on the ass of my husky jerk and followed it right up to shore.   Nothing.  I let it sink all the way to the bottom.  It folowed it all the way down and basically hovered over the damn thing for at least half-a-minute.  Nothing.  I twitched it fast, I twitched it slow.  One half-hearted slash at it then back to... Nothing.  I gave up after I failed to even raise it anymore.  Tomorrow I vowed... You will EAT!  So come today, the wind having blown my morning opportunity for salmon from the pier, I planned on trying again for that Pike when I finished work.  I get to the area around 3:30pm.  The water was really bad with zero visibility.  Fortunately this Pike area is semi-protected from the wind/waves so it wasn't as bad as the main lake.  My HJ14 in Firetiger is still on and I heave it out and straight retrieve it back just to see if he will show his mug.  A couple of cranks later and slam...FISH ON!  It feels good too----bigger than the Pike I had been targetting.  Probably just snagged one of the many huge Carp I see cruising in the area.  Seconds later it becomes clear...SALMON!!!!  Wait, What...What are you doing in 3 feet of water, right near shore in the middle of the day hitting my Husky Jerk?  Now I have bigger problems, with the water as it is, good landing spots do not exist and I do not even have the net with me.  Doh!  I settle on the least bad spot and give it a go.   Actually, there was some dude there with his bike.  I waved, I hollered, I motioned for his help.  Zip...Nada...Zero.  He mumbled something about RAD, and something about Mountain Dew, but that was all he could muster.   I time for in between the waves and grab her.   YES!  A nice, fairly dark female, and I have one-and-a-half soakers to mark the occasion.  Pics, are you kidding?  I hold it up to show Bike-dude---Nothing.   Back in the drink for you young lady.  Me and my now perma-smile amble back to the same spot and resume casting.  I am still shaking.  Three...maybe five casts later...Fish On! A little 2-3lb Pike.  Yes!   This fishing thing is OK!  Repeat procedure above.   Damn Bike-dude!  That was it.  A sweet, unexpected, and sunny late afternoon.  Fish are strange.  Fishermen....Ditto.  Cheers,  Mark"

387184,Rizzo,2009-09-26 03:08:00,4754,"good stuff, how big was the salmon?"
387187,farsider,2009-09-26 03:26:00,456,"It was around 20lbs. I was also lucky that she wasn't silver.  The bail spring on my normal casting outfit broke and jammed on me Wed. morning.  I dropped it off at Aikmans so all I had was my smaller bass reel to use.  I can spool it when I cast a cleo. I use an 8 1/2' rod and I tightened the drag right down on the reel and that seemed to make a difference.  Cheers, Mark"
387448,EC1,2009-09-27 08:57:00,930,"trout and pike together? Where were you fishing? Just Kidding.  anyways, good job to you. Pictures would be really nice next time"
