387624,LucG,2009-09-28 12:59:00,779,"I'm not sure if this subject has been brought up before, but I though I'd suggest it anyway.  On a few different boards that I frequent, they have a section for Off Topic disscusions. Though it might be a good addition to OFC. Under the MAIN SECTION we could have GENERAL DISCUSSIONS and then OFF TOPIC DISCUSSIONS.  Just a though..."
387625,TJQ,2009-09-28 13:03:00,7806,"Some one suggests this a couple of times a year...  were of the opinion that the board is splintered enough as it is, one of the things that is attractive, to some people anyway, is the fact that most of the threads are all in one place."
387630,LucG,2009-09-28 13:13:00,779,"You are right, it is nice not to have to go through mulitple pages to read others posts. I guess it can go both ways. I just feel like I am breaking rules when posting a topic that has nothing to do with fishing....lol"
387632,Terry,2009-09-28 13:24:00,14456,"I like it how it is  maybe it's already broken up into to many sections  I know I have missed things because I didn't go looking through the other sections  so just like most people if it isn't in the General Discussion area it doesn't get read   and as the saying goes, if it aint broken, don't fix it   http://www.ofncommunity.com/forums/index.p...ic=34485&hl http://www.ofncommunity.com/forums/index.p...ic=27230&hl http://www.ofncommunity.com/forums/index.p...ic=23328&hl http://www.ofncommunity.com/forums/index.p...pic=6871&hl http://www.ofncommunity.com/forums/index.p...pic=2662&hl http://www.ofncommunity.com/forums/index.p...ic=27230&hl http://www.ofncommunity.com/forums/index.p...ic=35926&hl http://www.ofncommunity.com/forums/index.p...ic=30647&hl"
387633,LucG,2009-09-28 13:27:00,779,I should have just kept my mouth shut....someone might as well delete this thread...
387641,Greencoachdog,2009-09-28 13:36:00,8163,"  It's ok Luc, you weren't the first... nor will you be the last to make that suggestion!"
387644,Roy,2009-09-28 13:42:00,13728," Not at all, Luc. Your offering the suggestion just means that you`re thinking for the good of the community."
387646,Raf,2009-09-28 13:49:00,3495,It's a great idea Luc.
