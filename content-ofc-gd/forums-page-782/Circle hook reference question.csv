387385,MCTFisher9120,2009-09-27 00:57:00,3761,"Buying circle hooks online for wacky rigging 5"" senkos. What size would be good to use, hard to guess the right size through a web page. Link is at the bottom, I'm assuming a Gamagatsu 2/0 or 3/0 would be the right size.  Please look at the page to make sure I'm on the right track, Thanks Mike  http://www.basspro.com/webapp/wcs/stores/s...tems#itemDetail  A Nautilus Circle"
387396,Greencoachdog,2009-09-27 01:24:00,8163,"2/0 would be the biggest I'd go with Mike, more like a 1/0 or 1... remember don't ""set"" the hook with a circle hook, just turn the handle on the reel!!!... Reel Boy Reel!!!  The fish needs to be swimming away from you to get the proper hookset with a circle hook!!!"

387410,SRT8 smoker craft,2009-09-27 02:40:00,1107,Hey mike don't be afraid to use a bigger hook I use a 4/0 wacky worm hook all the time I find the bigger hook doesn't doesn't affect how many hits I get but the smaller hooks do affect positive hook sets a lot get off with the smaller hooks mind you these are not circle hooks but can't see size making any difference considering FLW pros use offset worm hooks for wacky rigging and cash huge cheques if ya can get a few sizes.
387481,aplumma,2009-09-27 13:41:00,6896,"I am not sure how this applies but when using chunks of shad (6"") plus for catfishing the hook of choice is a 7/0 to 9/0 circle with anything from 8 lb to 56 lb being caught. I would be thinking the 2/0 or3/0 a good choice to begin. Don't be afraid of the bigger #'s the mouth on the bass is more than enough to inhale the larger hook.   Art"
387513,uglyfish,2009-09-27 16:44:00,981,"i use size 1 mostly, occasionally i go to a 1/O  and never lost a fish on them yet. its my go to rig for largies"

387649,ecxstriper,2009-09-28 14:02:00,343,A good rule of thumb is to use a circle hook  two sizes larger than you would use normally
