387298,Kinger,2009-09-26 18:03:00,351,"After checking out Laz's post I decided to post a few of my pics from my 2009 fishin'. No boat so I'm stuck on shore but I do alright for myself.  Spring started off good with a quality female on my first outing! I put my timmies Large lid for scale. X-rap!    Fishin' alone is peaceful but its hard to get a good shot!      This guy looked like a football!    My cat Tundra waiting for his share of the catch.    Old Humpy is coming home for the BBQ.    My first Atlantic Salmon on my first day ever targeting them.  I had heard about the fighting power but nothing could have prepared me for the fight they put up.  The bite felt like someone was trying to take my rod away from me!!  Mad respect for these fish, only ate one all season.    I got a nice little appetizer that night shortly afterwards.    A nice Chinook I got a few nights ago, great fun.    And my prize fish of the summer, 28 inch 7lb 10oz. walleye!    Me riggin' up, I like this shot the woman took it while we were watching the July 4th Fireworks. If we're gonna be at the river, might as well throw some slashbaits!    Two great blue herons on my arm, the best fishermen i know! Tight Lines!"

387308,bushart,2009-09-26 18:49:00,2628,That's a really great fishery
387309,BillM,2009-09-26 18:49:00,17367,I am kicking myself for not getting up to the Sault for Atlantics this year...
387312,Twocoda,2009-09-26 19:14:00,4130,Nice report ...i dont think i see any atlantics in your post though ...the one in the net is a fresh hen chinny
387315,laszlo,2009-09-26 19:34:00,487,"nicely done! those walleye are big for the river. i can't seem to get one bigger then 18"" out of the river i fish."
387316,johnnyb,2009-09-26 19:35:00,3413,"*sighhhh*  Why do I live down here?    Awesome post...I don't know if it's a chinnie or an Atlantic, nor do I care...thanks for the great pics"
387319,Kinger,2009-09-26 19:47:00,351,"  I disagree and I'll post another more graphic picture to prove it.  -black spots on the gill covers -no spots on the tail -caught in early july way before chinooks come up -orange/pinkish meat even after cooked, chinook turns white  "
387338,Dara,2009-09-26 21:44:00,3052,The best time for Atlantics is yet to come.  Nice post
387346,StoneFly,2009-09-26 22:27:00,574,"WTG,..nice Multi-species report!!!  I really wish those atlantics took down I here, that would be absolutely AWESOME, personally I odnt think its gonna happen.  Question:  is the lb for lb fight better than Steelhead?  cuz even if it were the same,...that would be insane with the size those atlantics can reach"
387348,Guest Johnny Bass,2009-09-26 22:57:00,0,Those are some pretty impressive pickerel and from shore to boot!Looks like some great fishing in your area. Thanks for sharing.
387351,darsky,2009-09-26 23:13:00,586,...............all Atlantic
387362,pike slayer,2009-09-27 00:05:00,1177,hey leave some fish down there for me!!! great report and these are all caught right in down town sault ste. marie!! great place to live!
387377,Leecher,2009-09-27 00:41:00,7832,Great report and pics Kinger You got to love it when you can catch quality fish like that from shore!!! Loved the pics of the big eyes Congratulations and thanks for sharing Leechman
387394,Kinger,2009-09-27 01:21:00,351,"Hey thanks for the kind words. It is great that I didn't drive more than 10 minutes to catch any of the fish in this post!  Stonefly, the biggest steelhead I've ever caught was about a 1-2 lbs. so I can't really draw a comparison. It reminds me of a smallmouth bass' aggression and head shaking, only wrapped up in salmon sized proportions."
