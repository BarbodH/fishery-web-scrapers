And then a short cab ride to the hotel and then to the ship (fort Lauderdale FL). She has been told she has to bring his car seat . . . for the cab ride and then have it with us for the trip. Has anyone had any experience in this situation? The other day I was driving home and seen a woman in a cab hold a toddler in her arms!!!! Do the laws change when you are in a cab or a bus as far as car seats go?  Thanks"

387913,solopaddler,2009-09-28 23:11:00,8605," Maybe, maybe not.  How come my 6 year old who's still required to use a booster seat isn't when rattling around like a jelly bean in the school bus?"
387917,BillM,2009-09-28 23:19:00,17367," Cause school buses are 'safe'  /sarcasm.  I dunno why, good question.  Although you can't compare a 6 year old and a baby that's 18months..."
387929,GBW,2009-09-28 23:29:00,8460,I know that P-n-fly didn't make use use a seat for our kids when they were 4 and 1.  We had the 1-year old in a stroller whith the wheels locked on the bus...  And that was only 2-years ago...
387931,Lostchild,2009-09-28 23:30:00,153,In Toronto toddlers are not required to be in a car seat while riding in a cab.
387968,backbay,2009-09-29 00:16:00,773,"The legality should be secondary to your child's safety. If you're going to ride in cabs in another country, why not bring it?"
