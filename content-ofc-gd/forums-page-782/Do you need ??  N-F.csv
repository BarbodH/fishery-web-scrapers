386773,Nanook,2009-09-25 02:38:00,565,"Do you need a Operators Card for those ""Jetski's"" Neighor down the street[ 60yrs old] has bought two for him and his wife and claims he does'nt need one. I said he does. Those things started the whole thing did'nt they?  Who is right ??"
386774,irishfield,2009-09-25 02:39:00,26272,YES JACK !! Those are the junk that started the whole mess !
386775,GBW,2009-09-25 02:40:00,8460,if it's not wind powered then yes.  DANG jetski's....
386779,Nanook,2009-09-25 02:43:00,565,Yeahhhhhh !  Now I can go and rub salt  YUK YUK !!!  Thanks guy's.
386780,Greencoachdog,2009-09-25 02:50:00,8163,"If he's 60, he may be ""grandfathered"" in and doesn't need a card..."
386781,Twocoda,2009-09-25 02:53:00,4130,Good point as to weather or not he needs one at his age ....but the way i understand it EVERYBODY must have it and the ownership of the trailer with them
386782,irishfield,2009-09-25 02:53:00,26272,Unfortunately no grandfather clause on this one in Canada. Nonsense with many of us driving boats since we was knee high to a grasshopper...
387170,Nanook,2009-09-26 02:26:00,565,"The way the  test are conducted, there maybe should have ""Grandfathererd'. But I guess someone needed a cash flow"
387183,Rizzo,2009-09-26 03:05:00,4754,ya up until a week ago you could drive a yacht with no license but not a jetski...needed a license for that for quite some time now
387228,Woodsman,2009-09-26 12:32:00,1286,No he doesn't need one. That's as long as he has $305 for every time he's checked.
387533,POLLIWOGG,2009-09-27 19:25:00,835,"He might have some other kind of proof of competency like a Power Squadron diploma issued before 199?.  I don't think the jetskis started it but kids getting killed on rented jetskis sure pushed it through.  ""I have right of way because I've been going this direction for a long time"" ( bickering salmon fisherman on the vhf in the 90's)  Things are a little better but not much."
