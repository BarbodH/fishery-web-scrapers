It put up a pretty good fight for a 2-3 lbs. fish.    BTW: Sorry about the sand on the fish. It was flopping around quite a bit.  This fish definitely got me excited for this season."
387542,Leecher,2009-09-27 19:43:00,7832,Nice surprise to hook into one of those Steelhead Thanks tibbs for sharing this beauty report Leechman
387562,BillM,2009-09-27 21:17:00,17367,"That looks like a big resident, not a lake fish."
387567,StoneFly,2009-09-27 21:39:00,574," Agreed, BIG ressie,...I got a 1lb last weekend, similar colours.  Should be alot Chromier to be a lake Runner.  Nonetheless, Excellent job!!!"
387576,BillM,2009-09-27 21:46:00,17367,"I should have capitalized BIG, cause seriously that is a monster resi!!!!  lol"
387578,tibbs,2009-09-27 21:53:00,650,Good to know. It definitely fought as well as a steelhead.
387582,fishinguypat,2009-09-27 22:02:00,547,saw a guy at bronte doin the centre pin  and catching small trout what line test were u using?
387587,tibbs,2009-09-27 22:17:00,650, I was using 12lb Siglon F with a 6lb leader.
387588,highdrifter,2009-09-27 22:21:00,2534,"Nice!  Sure has been an exceptional summer in terms of water temperature.  We're pulling resident fish much lower than normal...  Here's one from yesterday.  I think it's a steelie shaker, but she sure was purty!    Bring on the frost!!  cheers HD"
387590,BillM,2009-09-27 22:34:00,17367,"Fidel, that's a nice fish man!"
387595,SRT8 smoker craft,2009-09-28 04:44:00,1107," Did your bow have any clipped fins? looks like a stocker but like said before a wild resident will have nice fall colours either way beauty first bow .High drifter thats a sweet little chromer might be a small spawner looks like it's big for a ""shaker"" .good stuff getting the pin out this weekend last fish I caught on it was a big pumkin seed LOL can't wait"
387608,StoneFly,2009-09-28 11:27:00,574," Looks like a nice Hen to me, my guess is steelhead.  Nice Work, no lookin back now after all this rain comin,"
387753,MJL,2009-09-28 17:27:00,2427,Awesome catch Tibbs.  Congrats.  In the fall I catch tons of steelhead smolts heading down to the lake (some as big as the one you caught).  I know some guys who target them specifically during the salmon run with ultra-lites and light action fly rods with dry flies.  Mad fun going for them.  That's a beauty bow Fidel.  Well done
