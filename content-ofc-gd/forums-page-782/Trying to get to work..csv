Funny thing is this is not the problem.The traffic going west are the ones having crashes. So many that a couple of tow trucks sit there. The cause of the crashes, When the guys are trying to turn into the site. They are getting plowed into.. This is a full Construction job. their is barriers and pillions and fencing. This site isn't going any where soon. If thees crashes where happening in the middle of the day, it would be understandable. For people that don't travel the area every day they wouldn't know the site was there. But this is 6:30 in the morning. The same people every morning. What is wrong with people. Are they born with out brains!!!!!."
