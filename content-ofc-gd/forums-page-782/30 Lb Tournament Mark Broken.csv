387523,mbac31,2009-09-27 17:41:00,904,Congrats on the mlestone. Figured it would have come from Simcoe but non the less its still a huge bag on Smallies. Congrats  http://fishin-canada.net/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=2808
387527,misfish,2009-09-27 17:55:00,29133,WOW There was alot of big fish in those pics.  The arguement always was between Erie and Simcoe. Not any more.
387534,uglyfish,2009-09-27 19:27:00,981,WOW! that is an INSANE bag of smallies! 7.15 was big fish!!!

387541,tibbs,2009-09-27 19:41:00,650,Very Cool.  Congrats to the anglers who caught them.
387544,misfish,2009-09-27 19:45:00,29133, Charles Sims is a well known angler.
387546,GBW,2009-09-27 19:47:00,8460,WOW is all I got...
387597,PikeMolester,2009-09-28 04:59:00,428,i hate seeing all those monsters leaving the water
387611,farsider,2009-09-28 11:48:00,456,"Usually in Bass tournaments, the fish are Live-weighed and then released right after quick pics.   I would assume the same here, No?"
387617,Jer,2009-09-28 12:34:00,1426,"   ...yeah, me too...on someone else's line."
387619,Court R,2009-09-28 12:35:00,213,Way to go Chuck! All fish are released.
387626,Whitespinnerbait,2009-09-28 13:05:00,2038,  Then don't visit '' FISHING '' sites....
387674,darsky,2009-09-28 15:10:00,586,The arguement always was between Erie and Simcoe. Not any more.     I have known this for years
387695,cram,2009-09-28 15:54:00,1733,"Beautiful fish.  They all look pretty healthy.  When they release those fish, are they in/near the area where they were caught? I assume they are released somewhere just off the weighing station, right?"
387699,MuskyBill,2009-09-28 16:04:00,311,I see one bleeding from the gills.....  
387732,Gerritt,2009-09-28 16:53:00,6129,"Come on seriously?? I assume not one of the fish you have caught over the years never bled a drop? We fish.. it happens to all of us,  Congrats to the anglers! lets not rain on their parade.  G."
387734,mbac31,2009-09-28 16:59:00,904,"Gerrit is right , keep this post clean  guys. These 2 are some of the best anglers out there and do a ton for the sport. This post is meant to congratulate them not to bash."
387742,MuskyBill,2009-09-28 17:14:00,311,"Cram said all the fish looked healthy, & I pointed a bleeder out, & that's an issue??  Can someone else point out any negativity in my post? Being OFC, I knew someone would take issue with my post. Classic!  Man, some of you guys really need to get a life."
387751,Gerritt,2009-09-28 17:24:00,6129,  Or avoid the use of the emoticon that adds a negative tone to you're post...  JMHO.  G
387754,northwood,2009-09-28 17:28:00,63,"Nice catch guy's .....    october,november is when they fatten up for winter..."
