387684,MSBruno,2009-09-28 15:19:00,369,"Which knot have you all found gives the best strength when tying on your fluoro leaders?  I used to use uni-to-uni's but have always found them hard, but just tried the barrell knot and seems very strong.  Thanks in advance, Mark"
387686,Twocoda,2009-09-28 15:28:00,4130,i use a barrel knot ...no issues
387687,bdox,2009-09-28 15:33:00,329,"double surgeon's knot  http://www.animatedknots.com/surgeonsjoin/index.php  This is a must on a casting setup, where I find any other knot gets hung up on the guides."
387689,LucG,2009-09-28 15:38:00,779, I use this as well

387691,solopaddler,2009-09-28 15:45:00,8605,You might consider simply using a small black barrel swivel.
387693,PikeMolester,2009-09-28 15:50:00,428,i used an albright knot...no problems.
387712,JohnF,2009-09-28 16:23:00,3494," I've been experimenting with that, using Palomar knots. I knocked the ceramic ring out of my tip guide the other day. I guess I let the swivel sneak up above it.  JF"
387758,Fishing 24/7,2009-09-28 17:35:00,709,what type of fishing are you doing?  i would strongly consider straight fluoro.  any knot or swivel will add some type of burden.  swivel broke this guys ceramic tip.  knots will fail or will get hook on weeds.  iv been trying out all these type and techniques this summer.  and ended up going straight fluoro.  but this depends on what type of fishing your doing!
387764,fish-miester,2009-09-28 17:51:00,864,agreed with Fish24/7
387768,solopaddler,2009-09-28 18:04:00,8605,"Straight fluoro, that's pure fluorocarbon and not a hybrid, does not cast well. Terrible as a mainline, great for leaders."
387773,ecmilley,2009-09-28 18:19:00,2163,"on my dropdrop shot set ups i went away from flouro mainline due to twisting i use 15 lb power pro with a small swivel and fluoro leader no issues with line twist but do have to watch for reeling it through the guides, for my other casting, worming, jigging outfits I tie bloodknots for my connection for leader to mainline"
387828,CLofchik,2009-09-28 20:14:00,854," Orly?   Solo is a very very wise man...y'know, for a pinhead.   Knot if you tie the right knot properly. (Knot...not...heh get it? tee hee). For braid-flouro I like the Albright's.  Uni's are a pain to tie on the water and can put a pile of stress on the line when they tighten, Surgeon's I'll use tying float tippets but because they tighten off centre it will spin & twist retrieving lures.  And flouro being stiff can't take line twists.  You can trim an Albrights right next to the knot leaving no tag end to catch guides or weed, put a drop of Super Glue on it if you're paranoid. http://www.animatedknots.com/albright/inde...imatedknots.com"
387836,solopaddler,2009-09-28 20:28:00,8605,  PINHEAD??!!!!  
387839,CLofchik,2009-09-28 20:37:00,854," Oh don't get your panties in a bunch, sheesh.    ""Angler who catches the noble steelhead using current induced drag method"" is too much of a mouthful, I find ""pinhead"" a bit catchier."
387842,solopaddler,2009-09-28 20:51:00,8605, Ohhh you were talking about steelhead fishing with a centrepin.   Nevermind.
