311423,johnnyb,2009-02-27 13:58:00,3413,"Great report, Wayne -- been waiting for that to show up    I'm pretty sure I know exactly where you were on Kokoko...the spot Jess and I camped at is in one of your shots.  Beautiful back there...good on you guys for putting on the miles to come up with some dandy fish!"
311432,ccmtcanada,2009-02-27 14:21:00,7971,Wow!  Fantastic report!  Exciting from the get go...from the drive and accidents and close calls to what looked liked an amazing time out there fishing.  Congrats Llyoyd on one heck of a fish!  I always look forward to these kinds of report....great report!
311434,irishfield,2009-02-27 14:28:00,26272, Thanks Todd... I'll keep it in mind and watch for signs of life at your camp when I go by. The guys had an idea to sled to Lady E thru Diamond. Is there any substantial current we should be staying clear of in the North arm of Diamond?  I look like this from below + shiney floats in the summer of course.  
311440,Roy,2009-02-27 14:51:00,13728,Sorry I'm so late with this. A super report with enough pics to keep us going all year in the gossip mill.  Sounds like you all had a great time.. even a stuck sled will become a great memory.
311441,todd,2009-02-27 14:53:00,8,"Yes definately, beware of  the waterfall between diamond and lady E. It looks good but there is a heavy current there. Usaully there is a trail made around the bad spots. Even on lady E the water way narrows and has a decent current.,however the shore line is open and good riding, so if you stay off the water until the main body of water or at least till it opens up a bit you will be fine.That being said ive seen sled tracks right down these questionable spots and they seemed ok, but i would caution you there."
311442,irishfield,2009-02-27 14:57:00,26272, THANKS! Like they say if you don't know... don't go and why we didn't go this year. With that info and my topos we should be good Todd. Do you have a gas stash in your camp??? LOL.. We were just making it round trip to Ferguson Bay and back on fuel as it was.
311468,todd,2009-02-27 15:57:00,8,"gas stash? I'll never tell lol. I used to keep it outside in the winter but the wolves (believe it or not) would eat it ,the jerry cans to boot.So the answer is no. I really dont go much in the winter.I have some friends from new liskeard that go in often to check on the place but thats about it."

311055,Moosebunk,2009-02-26 04:19:00,3970,"What a playground for a bunch of playful kids. lol.  Digging out the sled... man, it was quite a dump wasn't it.  Thank gawd no slush under that eh?  I'm actually looking forward to more trips to that area... something weird is happening now. lol."
311056,irishfield,2009-02-26 04:23:00,26272, Was 4 or 5 inches of water under that foot and a half of snow unfortunately..but my new Kamiks with a can of waterprofer on them held up to it thank God ! Dumb part. .. We caused the slush mess from drilling the day before !

311142,tinbanger,2009-02-26 15:56:00,1028,Quite the adventure guys. My back is sore just looking at that stuck sled !  Some real pretty pictures too.  TB
311147,fishnsled,2009-02-26 16:11:00,3520,"Great report Wayne!  Looks like a great time was had by all and great to have everyone home safe and sound.   Well, not to sure how ""sound"" Joe is.  Not sure if pink is his colour but to each he own      Thanks for the laughs."
311188,todd,2009-02-26 20:32:00,8,great post! I have a camp on Diamond lake and am going up in a week. I hope I have some good fishing like you guys had. Have you ever fished sharp rock inlet for lakers?
311190,Headhunter,2009-02-26 20:39:00,5703,"Thanks for doing the report Wayne! Funny, but before I read it, I really didn't know that pink was my colour!   Great pics by the way... nice to see some scenery finaly as well!  And I also didn't know that Terry was wearing a turbin all weekend! HH"
311201,Terry,2009-02-26 21:25:00,14456,"well, you know my Taliban roots and all....LOL  you didn't know how did you think I felt when I saw that  just call me BinFishn"
311213,irishfield,2009-02-26 22:49:00,26272," Dang... and I thought Rick L. had the only camp in there. Were abouts is it?? I'll drop in some day (from the sky!), I've never fished Sharp Rock inlet... closests that I've downrigged is right at the entrance at Deer Island. Never in the winter.. too far to run just for lakers in the winter."
311221,Chuck Best,2009-02-26 23:17:00,308,"Hey Wayne,great report and all......That speckle lake was easy to find for me ,as I try to fish it every time up there.....isn't that red boat house there anymore?That's how I've always found it......Glad to see they're still in there too....TC and tight lines....Chuck...."
311257,ehg,2009-02-27 00:34:00,2666,"One of the few actual fishing reports on the board right now and a pretty good one, lots of nice specks and nice laker. Thanks for sharing this."
311307,walleyemaster,2009-02-27 02:44:00,325," hey wayne..ive downrigged sharp rock inlet in the spring....awsome fishing in there...lakers hit nicely...watch out for the seagulls nests..those buggers dive down at ya like no tomorrow...one island in the center of sharp rock inlet and its always full of seagulls nesting..we had some real fun there with some of the guys...  we would send them near the seagulls and tell them that it was a great spot to fish, then we would watch them get swarmed by the seagulls..lol"
311420,todd,2009-02-27 13:46:00,8,"ricks camp is on the island hub, Im up on the north arm.Im out of the way so many dont realize Im there. The camp has been there since 1969.Its not commercial obviously strictly family. But by all means come on by, im sure I could hunt down a refreshment or two to share."
310915,irishfield,2009-02-25 23:01:00,26272,"Headed for the camp mid morning last Wednesday...in driving snow..iced/slushed highways. Wasn't a fun drive in the least. By Port Severn (by Muskie Landing) I'd already stopped for the first time to check on a women that had rolled her car on the ramp for south bound and into the rock cut. Car was sitting on the drivers side and a few others got to her first from the south bound lane. They'd already called the    folks and had things under control.. so I got on my way before someone nailed my truck over in the North bound lanes. About 1/2 way to Parry Sound from Port Severn I had a guy come up to pass me in a car. I watched him closely in the mirror.....as I'd been out in the mess passing earlier myself and almost lost my truck to the median as it hydro'd in the slush... he swerved once.. he started to swerve twice so I slammed on the brakes, just in time, as he came flying across in front of me... missing the bumper by no more than a foot. Then he rolled 6 times in front of me and slide onto the shoulder wheels down. Amazing how fast a car slows when rolling sideways... I almost pushed him. Sure didn't look like a Malibou anymore! Guy appeared okay.. about to call 911 and the 4th car behind me was an OPP.  On my way again after a quick how/what/why with the officer. Crappy drive to Sundridge and then fairly good from there. Stopped to see Bernie in Powasson and put him an hour behind in the shop. Send me the ""labour"" bill Bernie.... I'll put it with the others I got this week.. same container! lol Made it to the lake around 4:30 to find my good neighbour out in the driving snow plowing my section of the ice road and my parking area. Had a chat and then went about unloading and getting the place ready for the lads. 9PM my neighbour comes up to the cabin and I find out he's been out there the whole time plowing with his 4 wheeler right to the town dock.... so the guys wouldn't get stuck. Unreal !  Lloyd and Keith were to be there by 11PM... got a call about then and they hadn't made it to North Bay yet. Roads even worse than previous. They finally got in the door about 1am...we yaked to about 2:30 (about the time Dano was getting up to head North) and hit the sack. Up at 7:30/8 and could hear a sled running. Dano was here and talking with my neighbour who was plowing again for us. 9am the four of us headed up the lake a bit to fish and close enough we could run back and forth when Terry and Joe (Headhunter) arrived... as well as the expected visit from Moosebunk.  Wasn't long and Lloyd was into the first fish in 70 FOW. Unfortunate.. and you can see it in his face... slot size fish... with bladder out it's gill plates.. DOA! MNR needs to get rid of the slot. Just make it 3 under and one over 18 inches for the winter months at least. What a waste to push that back down the hole...    Joe and Terry showed up out where we were fishing about 1:30. Moosebunk had dropped by while they were still at the cabin for a quick chat... but had to get on his way considering road conditions to meet his family in Cochrane off the train. I can't remember what all was caught.. not much.. but a bit and lots of screen action. We were a bit spread out to run for pictures unfortunately.  Supper Thursday night... BBQ STEAKS! Thanks Lloyd!    Here's at least one that got skunked doing dish duty.    Then hours of libation and laughter...    Friday am early...like always with that Lloyd around.... set up and fishing by 7:45    Terry and Joe    After a few hours we moved to a spot we did well at last year. Wasn't long and I heard Lloyd yell for help. Just look at that smile as line screams off the reel.    Here it comes.....    And what turned out to be the fish of the week for the group. Great stuff Lloyd. RELEASED healthy !    Another day of fishing down and another night begins! Laughter... lots of it... good for ya! the alcohol... not so much! lol    Saturday weather looked like it was going to be good... so we decided to do an adventure to a brookie lake about 27 miles away! -28C though... lots of fresh snow. None of the 3 passengers saw ANYTHING the whole way. Talk about blind faith! lol  Joe..way up around Devil Island.      Terry, Joe, Lloyd, Keith and Dano.    After an extra hour of searching... we finally found the access trail to a back lake we wanted to get to. Lake had totally melted down the previous weeks and then a foot or so of fresh snow = nothing to follow to find it. Once I got in and out once and Dano got in I hooked the cutter on and took it and Keith in.    Dano got stuck on the hill with Lloyd and his hut behind and Terry stuck behind him and had an interesting time backing out of the bush. Decision was made to leave the huts behind and Dan/Keith and I fished the Speck lake and Lloyd, Joe and Terry Lake Temagami.  Dano happy that nonsense was over and the day is ticking by pretty quick.    Some holes drilled and chasing specks.    Gorgeous scenery..    They (Terry/Joe/Lloyd) got skunked... we got into some fish. We'll Keith and I did. Keith's first tugger was this fella. Guessing Lake Herring.    Then what we were after..        Never seen a guy with so much energy.... Keith running and gunning with the auger!    ..and it pays off again.    We were only going to be in there for an hour or so... the other three started to wonder where we got to after a couple. I'd hit a tree coming out the first time hooking a ski and coming to an abrupt stop. Guess it screwed a carb float up as machine was flooding and wouldn't start. Cranking with plugs out had fuel blowing out the plug holes! We got it running and regrouped and headed for Kokoko lake. Joe trying to coax a fish up..    Terry doing the same with Dano and Lloyd way off in the distance.    Just another gorgeous place to be! Absolutely ZERO breeze.. sunshine.... temp up to about -10C and us sitting in the open in sweaters!    Laker and a Pickeral were the catch from there by Lloyd and Dano respectively...with Keith also getting 3 Lakers that he released.    Tired and sore from 60 miles of trail bashing... what to do... Give Joe the new guy ""gift""! Thanks for the laugh Dano!    Also Joe skunked... so dish duty. He even brought his own lovely gloves!    The old guy kicking back watching the leafs flutter again...    Lloyd cleaning the days catch. Now THAT's a knife!   All Brookies just STUFFED with Crayfish!    Anyone wonder why Lakers hit my big 8"" white tube last year... I think I know why.    So after another short nights sleep... what do we decide to do....the 60 mile rounder again.. and this time in driving snow. Bound and determined we can get everyone in the back lake this time. My sled seems to pull like hell... so we'll take everyone in and I'll round robin for our huts. Dan in and out first.. then he took Lloyd in and then I took the cutter in the trail..    and in is an understatement.    What a difference a day makes ! Learned to stop and walk first next time!    Terry drove in about the time Dan and I started taking turns shovelling to get the rig turned around. ticked off and ready to say lets just get out of here Joe and Keith walked all the way in. Figured we were all there anyhow.. lets fish it so I went out and got 2 huts and Dan got one... after packing a trail across to the other side of the lake first.  Here speckie speckie...    Terry starting to look miserable... lol    Then the curse lifted...    and again      With Terry rounding out the day in there with 7 nice Brookies. 2 Released.  Joe with the curse removed... another Lake Herring?    He also caught a brookie but was too far away to get a picture for him!  I caught a couple 11.5"" brookies and then this fella hammered my jig and started pulling out line. 18"" x 9.5 girth.    Stocked lake = keeper. Wild I would have let it go.    We stopped along the bluffs for a quick 50 minute fish. Wind was brutal and we had to make the Chinese restaurant before 6pm! Had a great supper and then time to clean some brookies again. Lloyd fell ill to a Crohns attack... so that was a real downer for him. No Chinese (well we brought him white rice) and he wasn't up for the morning fish either.      Another night of laughter (except for Lloyd tucked in about 7:30) and again 5 out of 6 of us up at 6am and out to get some fishing in before the lads wanted to head home at noon. Sun shining but wind again brutal at about 50K.      We fished until 11am and headed in. Guys packed up and on their way by about 12:15 for a sunny drive home. I stayed the night to kick back and try to get my neighbour out the next day, but he was busy doing drywall. Speaking of which they tested the ice on Friday. Lumber yard fork truck and a full lift across the ice!  Another great trip lads! You're a great bunch to share laughs with for sure. Everyone gets along and things run smoothly. Issue now is how we do it in future years seeing our group of 6 has really grown to about double that with cancels and fill in's each year. Guess we'll have to do two trips next year! lol And to think I couldn't get any takers for trips a couple years back... now there are waiting, cancel and begging lists ! lol  Note that ALL our fishing was done with artificials! No bait."
