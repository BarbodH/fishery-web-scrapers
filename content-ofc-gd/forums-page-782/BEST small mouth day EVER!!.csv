387739,Fishing 24/7,2009-09-28 17:10:00,709,"  Well believe it or not.  at one point i flipped a rock IN 20 FOW.  and i got a hit ,i set the hook and then he let go at the boat.  I SWEAR TO THE LORD!  6 Smallies were following behind.  i ended up catching one of his friends that was following the crew!  Talk about a feeding frenzy man!!"
387743,Fishing 24/7,2009-09-28 17:14:00,709,  Thats a fine idea ill catch 90 % of the fish while you film me!  colorado blades + bass in 20 FOW = skunk!
