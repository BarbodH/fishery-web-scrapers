386829,craigdritchie,2009-09-25 11:17:00,1586,"According to a story in today's Hamilton Spectator, health officials are advising people to stay out of the water and not eat fish from Hamilton Harbour due to a bloom of potentially toxic blue-green-algae.  Here's a link to the story online:  Spec Article"
386849,dks,2009-09-25 12:36:00,36,Thanks for posting the link. I always wonder when public officials say it won't affect the drinking water....... Has anyone noticed this in the Misssissauga waterfront area?
386875,johnnyb,2009-09-25 13:37:00,3413,"Don't Eat Hamilton Fish.....this is NEWS?!?!?!?   :lol:   Just kidding...sounded kinda funny at first, is all"
386893,BillM,2009-09-25 14:33:00,17367,I thought this was common knowledge....  I still don't understand how people eat fish out of Lake O.   It's nothing but a dumping ground for every other Great Lake....  *barf*
386911,Twocoda,2009-09-25 15:09:00,4130,i was going over the skyway last week and thought the algae kinda gives the water a tropical look...
386918,Dara,2009-09-25 15:21:00,3052,Since when does the algae affect eating the fish?  We have lakes here with it and still eat the walleyes. We only stop fishing when the smell on the lake gets too bad to tolerate while fishing
387022,MJL,2009-09-25 18:50:00,2427,"I fished pier 4 a couple weeks ago.  I did see quite a bit of scum literally glowing underwater.  At the fish-in that weekend, I vividly remember someone telling me that the blue-green algae is Earth's home grown version of kryptonite.  Swimming in it will give you super human strength  Or diarrhea"
387023,splashhopper,2009-09-25 18:53:00,2931, was thinking the same thing
387024,CLofchik,2009-09-25 18:54:00,854,A couple of years ago during another big bloom I let my dog go swimming in the Bay.  Took two weeks & bottle of antibacterial shampoo for the rash to go away.  Fun stuff.
387026,craigdritchie,2009-09-25 18:59:00,1586,"Hamilton is well known around the world for its delicious fishes. Nothing like a heap of Stelco Sheephead, or maybe a big plate of Dofasco Dogfish ...... mmmmmm. Tasty."
387029,Twocoda,2009-09-25 19:09:00,4130,  Now thats a bonified knee slapper After putting a minute of thought to this ...if we could convince a pharmaceutical company to make a vaccine out of the algae  i bet it would prevent diarrhea and clean up the water to the point they could shut down the water treatment plants...
387117,Burtess,2009-09-25 23:37:00,901,"If it is just algae then normally it is not a problem.  Cyanobacteria is not algae, it is a bacteria.  It has a blue/green colour because it respires via photosynthesis.  The byproducts produced include toxic substances. Have battled it in the fish tanks before....  Burt"
387224,Fish Farmer,2009-09-26 11:45:00,2234,"As we read this, some sit drinking a timmys (water from Hamilton) and smokin. Hmmmmmmm"
387250,Ziki,2009-09-26 14:11:00,128,  ...?
387276,canadadude,2009-09-26 15:59:00,769,No that would be the Atlantic Ocean
387280,fishinguypat,2009-09-26 16:12:00,547,i'm still eatin fish out of oakville though
387456,pikehunter,2009-09-27 11:42:00,1659,"There is an algae bloom like this every year, this year it seems to be later in the season.  Doesn't Lake O experience a similar bloom each summer? I can remember from past years reading about it and the drinking/tap water would have a distinct odour and an off taste too. Funny thing would be that the ""experts"" always said the water was fine for drinking, no problems, the water treatment plants just haven't had a chance to top up the chlorine content! LOL Probably still does happens in the summer but they have learned to increase the chlorine before it gets noticed, don't know if it was blue green algae or a different type though."
388068,hammercarp,2009-09-29 02:42:00,964, That's US Steel sheephead and Arcelor Mittal dogfish.
