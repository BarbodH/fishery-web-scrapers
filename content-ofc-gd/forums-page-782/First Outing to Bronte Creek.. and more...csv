388020,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-09-29 01:32:00,0,"  well, um...i see your point...maybe don't post it publically... but i'm an avid float fisherman and 'pinner who has no intention of utilizing this technique.  perhaps someone could even pm it to me?  i'm not up on my poaching techniques... i'm from sault ste. marie...the salmon poachers here just go downtown and do it the old fashioned way... cast out something really heavy, reel in and jerk the rod real hard every few seconds!"
388029,solopaddler,2009-09-29 01:43:00,8605,"  In the immortal words of Dick Swan use a ""searching leader"" LOL!"
388034,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-09-29 01:50:00,0,"i've had it explained and i'm not convinced.  guys use that technique here in town with roe and the hook is often INSIDE of the mouth.  while it's possible this technique could be foul hooking fish it seems just as likely that they'd be instinctively swatting at the presentation just like they do your drifted roe bag...not to mention that drifting a roe bag could in fact produce the exact same result, especially if you let it swing across a tailout."
388037,JohnF,2009-09-29 01:53:00,3494," Really? I just wrap it around my forefingers (you know, the one to the left and right of the obscene one) and slip it between my teeth. I just got some really nice tutti frutti flavoured stuff from the dentist. It's better than chewing gum.  And don't be so cheap. Put an extra wrap on each finger. In the end you'll be happy you did.  JF"
388058,[email protected],2009-09-29 02:25:00,290," Indeed.  I don't intend to ""floss"" or ""line"" or ""snag"" or one of the other 5000 names for catching salmon.  And I don't keep my fish anyways. I am all about the catch and release, if anyones read my other posts you would know that.  I've never fought a salmon before and I can imagine it would be a hell of a fight"
388200,CLofchik,2009-09-29 16:22:00,854," Drifting roe under a..ahem...""searching leader""...does indeed produce the same result.  If you're using a hook smaller than a 1/0 treble the only time it will stay pinned is if you snag a part of the head, almost always unless you are real ""lucky"" a small hook won't stay stuck in a fin.  That's when you see bottom fishing guys getting ""sniffs"" or ""rubs"" or ""short strikes"".  So the fish that are landed are ones where the hook finds the jaw hinge or a piece of flesh in the roof of the mouth, and then hey obviously the fish ate the ear plug, look it's hooked in the mouth!  It does sound kooky, but that's how it works.  Salmon WILL eat eggs in the river, but they are very spooky fish.  If you can see them, they can see you and sure as heck aren't in the mood to be chasing anything.  Here's a shot of a salmon that actually ate some skein under a float, see how deep the hook is?  If it's around the edges of the jaw or hooked from outside-in it's probably a floss job.  "

387634,[email protected],2009-09-28 13:27:00,290,"I wanted to post this last night but the site was having a stroke.  I've never been salmon fishing before, and I've never seen anything quite like what I saw on Bronte Creek yesterday.  There had to of been like 50 people fishing in the span of 30 feet. It was crazy.  As we were walking up and down the creek, it was sad to see a bunch of dead salmon on the creek bottom with their bellies slit up   Very sad.  I didn't have the proper salmon baits, but I read sometimes they strike Mepps spinners, so I tossed one for a bit and didn't get any hits, but man oh man, it was sooooo cool to see a big one come up pretty much to shore and haul butt up the creek, causing huge wake.  It was really cool experiencing that as I have never seen it in person. I think I have salmon fever now.  After that we headed out to the pier by the skyway and talked to a bunch of people there. They were definitely jumping, however I couldn't get any of them to hit my spoons.  Then, I heard of carp under the lift bridge, so I started using corn, and we started catching these...   There were alot of seagulls around, and they got fed pretty well with all the gobys I was catching.   It started to get pretty late, so we threw all the corn + worms into the water off the pier, and I casted my worm out one more time.   This little guy put up quite the run, I was surprised lol.  Awesome coloring on this guy. The picture doesn't do it justice.   After that we packed it up and ate some fish+chips down the street at Hutches!"
387637,Greencoachdog,2009-09-28 13:33:00,8163,It sounds like you had a fun day!!!
387648,mbosh1980,2009-09-28 14:01:00,349,what type of fish is that first one?  edit: nevermind I see it now
387658,[email protected],2009-09-28 14:36:00,290,One other thing that I meant to ask.  Is using Marshmallows taboo?  I asked a few relatives and they said thats what they used to use back in the day to catch trout and salmon in the creeks.  Then I read threads on here where people are getting flamed to holy hell for using them...
387659,[email protected],2009-09-28 14:36:00,290,oops double post.
387664,Ziki,2009-09-28 14:49:00,128,"The reason they are flamed is because they are only used to float up your hook to assist in lining fish(legal snagging if you will). Ear plugs work just the same. Some companies have decided to profit off this and you can now buy colored marshmallows with all types of scents at fishing stores. This is why new fishermen assume it is a legitimate form of fishing. Some of these fishermen happen to use these marshmallows with success, unknown to them is that they are just lining fish. They then come here and post of their ""success"" to which they are often treated to flaming from the educated members."
387672,Twocoda,2009-09-28 15:07:00,4130,Marshmallows isnt taboo.It requires a certain type of presentation that is generally required when using them ( bottom bouncing ) and some people believe that that type of presentation is for lazy fishermen...( sit and wait). Sometimes issues come up when a bottom bouncer (regardless of the bait) casts into a moving pool that float fisherman are using and they have to cut their drifts short due to a stationary technique....so some people frown upon it ..im not saying its wrong but most times a bottom bouncer is new to fishing and sometimes over looks consideration to other fisherman and their techniques. Some rivers in the Maritimes when fishing pools after three casts in the same spot its an unwritten law that you take three steps down the pool and repeat until you are at the end of the pool in which you step out of the water and walk to the top of the pool and start over ....  The technique is best used in deep slow moving pools /harbours ( ideally where float fisherman are not at )
387675,[email protected],2009-09-28 15:10:00,290,"I planned on heading back there later tonight (Since its been raining pretty good since last night), and I was thinking of trying a some marshmellows, but I don't want to come here and get flamed if I catch something lol... Nor do I want to be pushed in the creek, or who knows what else...."
387682,bushart,2009-09-28 15:18:00,2628,"Hang On, Hang On!!!!!  I have something of more importance than the lining marshmallow dead horse to address...  IT's...  1. Bronte Creek 2. Burlington Pier &  3. Esterbrook Hot Dogs  Jeeez Rookies.....Here Endeth The Lesson"

387797,[email protected],2009-09-28 19:13:00,290, .... Nice reply..  Are you not able to legit use marshmallows? Why is it different from other baits to make it flamebait.  I don't understand what you are talking about...
387808,CLofchik,2009-09-28 19:38:00,854," Salmon don't actually bite the marshmallow, the whole point is to float your hook off bottom and snag them by their big hooked mouths.  Doesn't have to be a marshmallow, a foam earplug or piece of styrofoam will work just as well.  Actually better, ear plugs don't melt.  That's why bottom fishing for salmon is looked down upon as a lazy immoral way to catch a fish.   Was that you & your friend with the pods fishing the channel?  The better carp spot is fishing the bay side further south right off Eastport Dr. by the traffic lights."
387816,[email protected],2009-09-28 19:53:00,290, Ok I get it now.  Nah that wasn't me. I was with 2 girls Fishing right beside the lift bridge. Then we moved to the lake side.
387904,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-09-28 23:05:00,0,"while i don't dispute it's possible, i would like proof that a salmon or steelhead will not bite a bait that COULD resemble a roe bag."
387907,BillM,2009-09-28 23:07:00,17367," They'd nail a marshmellow for sure, I've caught more then a few down at Port D on them when I was a kid...  Are they generally used for flossing fish?  Yes"
387915,irishfield,2009-09-28 23:15:00,26272,It's not the bait.. it's the presentation. Roe bag or marshmellow doesn't dictate flossing.
387920,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-09-28 23:21:00,0,so how does one floss?  i've gathered it's a stationary presentation? is it stringing across a tailout or something?
387941,raptorfan,2009-09-28 23:37:00,126,"I got my first ever salmon out of the Credit River last wednesday night on the way home from Bass Pro Shops man.  I have been out there again almost every night since.  I took a trip up river yesterday, and it was just like you said.....unbelievable.  I didn't see much massacre yet though, and I hope I don't.  I am also from Brantford area (Mount Pleasant), send a PM if you are into going up one night."
