387511,mrdylan,2009-09-27 16:28:00,111,Hi as of this morning when I open a post the replies show up condensed at the bottom instead of like a regular thread and I can't find a way to change it back. Is something new that was done on purpose or is there something I am missing to change it back?   EDIT: I think I got it sorry I didn't see the options button in the thread itself.
