517029,rufus,2010-11-03 01:14:00,267,"I bought a Micro Camera online from http://www.themicrocamera.com/ and tested it on the weekend with plans of using it next season. The camera takes very good video for its size. The downside is the built in rechargeable battery seems to have a life of about 8 minutes. I am hoping that will improve with multiple charges...  <center><object width=""480"" height=""385""><param name=""movie"" value=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsdjwEeZGwA?fs=1&hl=en_US""></param><param'>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsdjwEeZGwA?fs=1&hl=en_US""></param><param name=""allowFullScreen"" value=""true""></param><param name=""allowscriptaccess"" value=""always""></param><embed src=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsdjwEeZGwA?fs=1&hl=en_US"" type=""application/x-shockwave-flash"" allowscriptaccess=""always"" allowfullscreen=""true"" width=""480"" height=""385""></embed></object></center>"
517033,mercman,2010-11-03 01:28:00,7054,Thats the coolest idea ive seen in a long time.I`m gonna check it out.Thanks
517042,sleepjigging,2010-11-03 02:16:00,207,Were those bear tracks or something on the wooden path? They were awfully big and did not stay on the track as a human would.  Jiggy
517048,Joey,2010-11-03 02:26:00,9122,"Pretty good video for the price.  I kept thinking ""careful, don't slip"" LOL.  And yes, I was expecting fish  Joey"
517050,rufus,2010-11-03 02:29:00,267," Jeez, I hope not  There are stepping stones at the beginning - so that is what the big round ""tracks"" are. The tracks at the end are mine. The ramp is steeper than it looks so walking in a straight line when it is slippery is not easy. Besides, I just woke up at the crack of noon - so I was half asleep"
517051,rufus,2010-11-03 02:34:00,267, So was I!  Sometimes nature just doesn't cooperate. That is the problem with the short battery life. It takes two hours to charge and so far is just lasting 8 to ten minutes. I have not used it much yet though...
517054,ld17,2010-11-03 02:58:00,319,can you zoom in or out with the cam.  Ya the short battery life could be a problem.
517056,Jet,2010-11-03 03:26:00,364,"Try this one. Only cost you a screw and washer and an old hat.     I use this method. Keep the hat handy, hook a fish, set the hook, put on the hat, memorize the ""video"" button procedure and off I go. That last part is particularly easy with my Panasonic TS2 because it has a dedicated video button.  I also find it's easy and fast to take self portraits with this hat cam because you can just lay it on a bag, floor ect.. and hit the timer button. I used it in my last bull trout report to do just that."
517066,rufus,2010-11-03 04:25:00,267," Yeah, I saw that the other day and am going to try it with an old camera. The advantage with the micro cam though is that with the small size you can also have your regular camera filming and the camera on your head is almost unnoticeable when you are in the shot.  No zoom but one is not really needed."
517090,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-11-03 12:15:00,0,I think hat vid cams's are great!
517121,ld17,2010-11-03 13:54:00,319,I checked the web site and it says the battery should last and hour.  Give us an update after you've used it for awhile.
517139,Headhunter,2010-11-03 15:28:00,5703,Might the cold temps have an effect on battery life? HH
517161,rufus,2010-11-03 17:04:00,267, I don't think it was the cold weather as it was coming out of a warm cabin. I am going to see if I can condition the battery to last longer and will report back.
517164,misfish,2010-11-03 17:14:00,29133,Now thats what I need.  BTW That sounded like a mitchel 310.  Love the duct tape aswell.LOL
517168,Governator,2010-11-03 17:35:00,879,That's cool thanks for sharing.  I like the way limeyangler does his videos (Although I'm not sure how).  Seems to always be attached to his rod near the reel.  Always turns out nice.
517220,rufus,2010-11-03 20:51:00,267,"Yes, it is an old Mitchell 301 from the '80's and the rod is equally as old. I hate throwing away fishing stuff...  Update on the battery - I just recorded 18 minutes and it was still going. I think the issue is not the battery perhaps but how I was charging it. The battery is charged through the USB port on a computer. Previously I was using a laptop to do this which may put out less power than a desktop unit. Today I charged using a desktop and the battery has more power. There is no indicator to tell when charging is complete or how much charge is left in the battery. The instructions just say to charge it for a couple of hours."
517299,moparhawk,2010-11-04 01:45:00,146,If Limey approves I might be all in. Thanks for the tip
517324,ld17,2010-11-04 03:21:00,319, I would think charging it from a laptop would be fine.  Did you charge it the same amount of time with both the laptop and desktop?  I would leave it on charge for a good number of hours to make sure it's fully charged.  I might get one.  But the recording must improve.  I checked around for some head cams and came across the same one you have and they want 80 bucks for it on sale from 140.  Friggin mark ups.
