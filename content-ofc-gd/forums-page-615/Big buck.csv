517347,Harrison,2010-11-04 11:25:00,2202,Nice bud.  I hear ya on the rain. I let the powers to be know I could be a couple hrs late this morn if we got the rain we were supposed to......now I'm on the train.
517358,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-11-04 12:53:00,0,"nice big bow.  and that's actually a pretty good picture for solo... considering how steep the banks are, how big the fish is, and how long a float rod is to manage in the meantime.  i don't fish on weekends as much either.  i've never been one for crowds... even northern ontario ""crowds""..."
517383,frozen-fire,2010-11-04 13:55:00,542,Beautiful steelhead...I'm waiting for one like that
