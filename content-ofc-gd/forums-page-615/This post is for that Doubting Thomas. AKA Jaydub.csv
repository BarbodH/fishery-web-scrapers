516956,Cudz,2010-11-02 21:28:00,2652,"I had plans to go out fishing with Jaydub at 8 pm.  He bailed on me because he ""Did not think we would catch anything."" Well, despite the cold it was beautiful out there and I had a blast (alone). After texting Jaydub this morning he also said ""I had better have a pic of the bass I caught""  LOL!,  Here it is.  You missed out bro. Truth be known that fishing was slow but I got back to the launch at midnight and caught countless perch in 25 minutes, so that was fun too.  Here is your pic Jaydub! "
516958,Burtess,2010-11-02 21:35:00,901," Since when does catching anything have to do with quality time with a buddy????  Nice bass, glad you had a good time!!  Burt"
517004,jaydub,2010-11-03 00:02:00,145," Who said anything about a buddy...   Okay, so I probably should have gone but night time fall fishing without minnows is pretty tough and I thought maybe if I stayed home I'd get lucky   .  Congrates on the smallie Cudz...let the streak continue!"
517007,Cudz,2010-11-03 00:08:00,2652,"Since last night, I believe."
517009,Cudz,2010-11-03 00:11:00,2652,Just tell the truth.  It was too cold for you.  Maybe it was too late for you.
517012,Rizzo,2010-11-03 00:15:00,4754," cudz showed his pics, where's yours?"
517013,Cudz,2010-11-03 00:18:00,2652,LOL! I think he got skunked.
517034,Jigger,2010-11-03 01:34:00,1237,"Nice fish man. Just goes to show you, you never know whats going to happen out there. At least one of you got lucky! :clapping:LOL"

517249,misfish,2010-11-03 22:32:00,29133," Just asking here,before or after dark."
517337,Cudz,2010-11-04 04:20:00,2652,It was midnight brian.  Right at the lauch (marina) where they keep the light on.  Lots of fish.  Hundreds.
517427,misfish,2010-11-04 17:00:00,29133, The crappies got to be there too then.Better eats then those perch.
517550,Cudz,2010-11-04 23:33:00,2652,maybe.  I did not see them.  There were lots of perch. Mostly small but the odd 10 incher. Maybe I will go tonight.
