516882,misfish,2010-11-02 17:06:00,29133,"First off,what a very very quiet morning.Not a turkey cluck anywhere or deer to be seen or red squirl.Very quiet. So I decided to push the bush a mile and a half back. Didnt even jump a deer anywhere.So I just sat a few times and took some pics.  Cold enough to freeze the water ponds.    Now do you  see what I see? These blown over tree roots have been around for awhile,but I stared for a bit and I see a rotten salmon and a preistoric gar.    Salmon top left.    And the gar     On my way out ,I went to visit that scrap and rub.He,s been back.Maybe that spray of doe got him excited as he ripped it up good.  "
516890,NAW,2010-11-02 17:35:00,4022,"Why are you thinkin about fishing, when your out huntin?  Musta been a real quiet morning..  Any signs of more gangs doggin your bush?"
516892,Nipfisher,2010-11-02 17:40:00,2449,I want some of what you are smoking. Looks like tree roots to me. Sitting quiet in the bush does strange things to a man's mind.

516896,blaque,2010-11-02 17:49:00,2419,"Double LOL, was staring at these pics and about to say the same thing.  Did you lick any frogs by the frozen water ponds?? LOL"

There are strange things seen in the midnight sun By the men who moil for deer; The atv trails have their secret tales That would make your blood run cold; The Northern Lights have seen queer sights, But the queerest they ever did see Was that day on the marge of Lake Lebarge I couldn't see the same as Brian B."
