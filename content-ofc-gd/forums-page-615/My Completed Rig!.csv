517567,bucketmouthjohnny,2010-11-05 00:26:00,115,"Looks nice Stoty !! ps, what does G2 stand for"
517576,mbac31,2010-11-05 00:46:00,904,I would assume Gary and Grant= G2 Nice wrap Stoty. I will be getting my boat wrapped over the next few months as well. Motor is running well now I guess. How have you guys been doin on the Bay
517584,splashhopper,2010-11-05 01:15:00,2931,simple clean lines... unlike so many other pro's boats that look like Nascar on the water.  
517593,Gman,2010-11-05 01:32:00,126,"Lookin' sharp!  Sometimes less is more, and that is a perfect example. I'd say it worked out perfect since your Blazer is already black, just had to add the G2 Angling name and apply the perf. to the windows.  Cheers G."

517880,Stoty,2010-11-05 23:17:00,2910," Yes, that's what G2 means. Our motor? Not really! Just had to replace the compression pump!  We've been doing extremely well on the Bay recently! We have been hitting some MONSTER fish! Our biggest three being 14.6, 13.4 and 12.6! The Bay is on fire now, and I highly recommend everyone give these monster walleye a shot!  If anyone has any questions, please don't hesitate to ask!  Cheers, Stoty"
