516376,Fish Farmer,2010-10-31 16:43:00,2234,"Chad It's held different weeks in Oct. We wait till we get permission to fish the marina because we can only fish when all the boats are out. We advertise on Ice News, GHOC club site and Stelco club site. Your more than welcome to come out Chad, it's open to everyone. More the merrier. Would be nice to see more kids out. The kids were having a ball.  Your right Wayne. As long as I wake up the right side of the sod  , I'll be there  ."
