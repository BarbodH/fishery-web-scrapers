We hit a couple of bays and fished them hard, mainly just to stay warm lol! Husky Jerks produced the only fish we boated, we lost 3 or 4 others boatside and had a couple of nice follows. The two fish below were all we could manage for photo ops. A slow twitch pause retrieve turned a few followers into biters. Water temps have dropped ddrastically with these frost mornings we've been having, the warmest water we found was 47F... brrr!      Cheers, Shaun"

517259,Shaun Rickard,2010-11-03 23:22:00,144," The best bit of advice I can give you is fish slow, really sloww twitch pause retrieve, and downsizing baits can help, all the fish we have had over the past few weeks have hit the HJ12 size Husky Jerks  Cheers, Shaun"
517277,spinnerbaitking,2010-11-04 00:15:00,1622,Thanx Shaun we'll give them a try Richard
