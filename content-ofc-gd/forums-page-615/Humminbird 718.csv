On another forum I cruise a humminbird 718 has come up for sale with GPS and the wide transducer,.... the guy is asking $250 Is it a good unit ???  I was wondering if I can hook that up to a standard deep cycle battery ? or if I need more ?  Basicly I have a H.Bird 585 right now... its currently hooked up to my deep cycle battery that powers my trolling motor and it works fine ! by tthe looks of it, the 718 has the same base as my 585 ... so can I hook up the GPS puck and just drop the unit onto my old base ??  Thanks for any help !"

517130,Uncle Buck,2010-11-03 14:49:00,1000,"the 718 i believe will only do point tracking... not full gps...  a lot of the humminbird stuff interchanges...  i've got a 767, matrix 17 and a matrix 67...  all the plugs are the same... (mounts, power, gps/accessory and transducers)  check the gps puck to see how many satellites it'll pick up...  AS-GR4 - 4 satellites AS-GR16 - 16 satellites AS-GR50 - 50 satellites...  make sure you get the ""Y"" cable, it allows you to hook up the gps and other accessories"
517350,Lunker777,2010-11-04 12:07:00,866," I asked him about the GPS puck and this is the response .... "" The puck is a gr 16/4. Hope this helps. ""  Would that mean it picks up 16 satellites ?"
517356,Uncle Buck,2010-11-04 12:35:00,1000,they didn't make a 16/4...  it's either a 16 or a 4...
