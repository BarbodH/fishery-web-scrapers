516270,12footspringbok,2010-10-31 02:08:00,459,Fall is definatly my favourite time of year.  This year has been no exception. Hit the river bank about a dozen or so times now with the company of some friends. Anyways not much for story telling but heres a few pics.  Salmon were slim pickings still this year but still managed a few.     Trolling flatfish have taken a few bows.   My favourite has been sitting in the fold out chair still fishing a deep pool. Not many big fish but lots of little guys with crazy air shows. Definatly some good spawning went on and good survival a few years ago.              Up to the french bright an early tomorrow for the deer hunt to put the icing on the cake.

517098,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-11-03 12:44:00,0,Nice clean looking trout.I think when river fishing the smaller ones are the better scrapers. The big ones just run and run and run.lol
