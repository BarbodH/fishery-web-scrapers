517809,GBW,2010-11-05 18:47:00,8460,Hey Brian. My cousin just asked me if I want any buck tails.  I'm going to say yes but what's the best way for me to answer back?  I don't want to have to cut it off the flesh.  Thanks. Geoff

Once you get them,just slit down the bone in the tail.White side up.Pull the bone out.You will have to wiggle your finger in there to seperate the flesh. I just salt the crap out of them and let air dry.  If anyone need tails,I can see what I can do for yas."
