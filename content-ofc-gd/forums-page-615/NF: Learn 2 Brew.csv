I started a club here in Southern Ontario called ""Are You An ?""... (Southern Ontario Brewer)    Here's the blurb on our event....  If you want to see how to make your own beer... Toronto's largest homebrewing club can show you how!  Learn 2 Brew Day occurs on the first Saturday in November, when new, and not so new homebrewers around the world are encouraged to learn how to brew or teach someone how to brew.  We'll have onsite homebrewing demonstrations by over twenty different brewers, each with their own unique style and approach. Learn how to brew, to build a setup to match your needs, and budget!  Saturday, November 6th from 10am until 6pm Amsterdam Brewing Co. 21 Bathurst St, Toronto  If you can make macaroni and cheese, you can homebrew; it's that simple.  For more info, click here...        The Breweriana Society will be upstairs showing off their collections, and you can always pick up some Amsterdam beer while you are there.  Feel free to come on down and join us, there is no admission charge, and we're all pretty friendly!    Cheers"
