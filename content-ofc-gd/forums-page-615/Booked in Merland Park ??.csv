517395,Terry,2010-11-04 14:53:00,14456,and that is reason number 8 why many people don't go back there hope every calls to confirm they res.
517410,irishfield,2010-11-04 15:42:00,26272,We don't want to go over reasons 1 to 7 again... lol
517474,crappieperchhunter,2010-11-04 20:03:00,2582,Never been out for a GTG...but they sound like fun. Someday hopefully.  However from things I have read on this Board from the past and now with this thread...NO WAY EVER...Merland's will ever see me.  I just can't bring myself to do business with such people.  Glad you found out when you did Lew & Phil.
517500,irishfield,2010-11-04 21:44:00,26272,Just tell them you're doing a TV show and need a cabin and a guide... they'll have room for you. Unfortunately then Joey and Paul may not have a reservation either...
517504,GBW,2010-11-04 21:52:00,8460,HAHAHA... hummmm    (note: the  is not directed at Joey & Paul but you gave me an evil idea)  not going to do it though...
517526,Gerritt,2010-11-04 22:42:00,6129,"Perhaps the no night fire clause at Perfectvu is not so bad now.....  once again Merlands has shown their stripes....  I cannot wait to hear about the docking/mouse turd fiasco! LOL, it will bring back memories! Ones I wish to forget however...  G"
517607,Gerritt,2010-11-05 02:21:00,6129,"Just found out tonight... We are allowed a night fire at PerfectVu, a group fire.. which is exactly what is needed..  G"
517611,GBW,2010-11-05 03:15:00,8460,A few pit's too G as I was the caller
