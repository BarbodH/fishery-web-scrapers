517523,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-11-04 22:31:00,0,"Hey man, Gustavsson played great. 1 Goal He was screened(and it was deflected), 2 were because of poor man to man coverage in our end. They left a guy open. And the last one was a Mitchell give away. He played well and we should have won that game! Did you see that incredible stick save? He was keeping us alive. I think he has been playing better then Guigere.  I caught the game in the middle(only to see caps score two quick goals to make it 3-1). But I watched leafs in an hour(short version) on leafs TV. All I will say is the leafs played great and almost beat a better team. There was not one player that did not show up. They all did their part.  This game will be a turning point. The Leafs have a decent team but they were on a scoring slump and lacked confidence. With these 4 goals, many players got some new found confidence. With Kulimen being the best forward on the ice and Versteeg picking up his game. I have a felling their goal scoring drought is over!  Go Leafs Go!!!!"
517528,misfish,2010-11-04 22:45:00,29133,"Im disappointed that no one talked about the tribute to the vets.There wasnt a dry eye in any of them,myself included. Lest we forget.  Thanks to them,they allow us to banter."
517038,muskymatt,2010-11-03 01:52:00,2608,"  Man am I happy the Sens won!!! No leaf wrath tonight!!  I didn't rule out a loss but then again the laffes sucked soooo bad tonight,,,i should have known.   Anyone see all the empty seats?  Phanus hurt!that's too bad..never like to see guys out...but at least they can't boo him now.  6 losses in the last 7 games....I can smell the fresh parade pavement now  Boooooooooed again in their own rink!!!  bwahahhaahhahah"
517045,solopaddler,2010-11-03 02:17:00,8605,"It was tough to watch.  They ould lose every game and they'd still be my team.  If I were you I wouldn't be too quick to jam it down our throats, it's a long season."
517046,asdve23rveavwa,2010-11-03 02:19:00,2690," Totally agree, Mike!!  Ah, the life of a Leaf fan.  For the Sens fans out there, I wouldn't be too proud of that effort either."
517049,Guest LivingLegend,2010-11-03 02:27:00,0,LETS GO RAPTORS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
517053,kickingfrog,2010-11-03 02:52:00,8333,The amusing part is that Centurion fans think Leafs fans care about them.  I've got underwear older than them for pete's sake.  They're not even worthy of the loathing that habs fans have earned.
517059,jediangler,2010-11-03 03:40:00,1923,"Leafs were a better team after losing their captain tonight. If they played the whole game like the last 15 minutes of the third period, they might have won that one."
517060,Chance,2010-11-03 03:41:00,420,"Naw, no empty seats ,just the start of the period ,fans not back yet. Actually the Leafs did not suck tonight as you so eloquently put it,they just had a hard time putting it in the net. Speaking of planning the parade awful giddy aren't we after beating the Leafs?Definitely shows how important they are in your world.I do however sympathize and understand your bitter obsession with the Leafs.It must be tough going to a sens game only to be out numbered by Leaf fans at your home rink.  "
517068,anders,2010-11-03 04:46:00,1168,Easy...they both suck
517082,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-11-03 11:55:00,0," That's what I was thinking! I was thinking we should have benched Phaneuf a long time ago(he causes most of the goals!) Hopefully he is out for awhile(but not serious of course). I want to see Lebda, beauchimen, Komisarek and Schenn pick up the slack!  And Wilson has to go. I cant believe he didn't have Bozak taking the faceoff with less then a minute to go in their end.  Start the Monster next game.  And what happened to Zigomanis??I liked that player!  Man I knew we would hear it from Musky Matt. Enjoy it while you can Matt!!!"
517085,timmeh,2010-11-03 11:58:00,609, Ya that's probably the truth. I can smell an intense battle between them this year.......for the 11th seed in the East.
517100,stubbex1,2010-11-03 12:47:00,164, ditto no defensive zone coverage on both sides
517115,jjcanoe,2010-11-03 13:34:00,744,"Congrats on the sens win, as a Leafs fan, I can sympathise with all those sens fans. It must be hard to have gone so long without a Stanley cup.  41 years for the Leafs seems like a drop in the bucket compared to what the poor sens fans have had to endure, 1927 is a LOOOOOOONNNNNNGGGGGGG time ago...... 83 years. More than double the length of time the Leafs have endured.  Chin up sens fans! it will end eventually  jjcanoe"
517126,jimmer,2010-11-03 14:24:00,2730,Did you watch the same game? The Sens were horrible and the Leafs were horrible at getting the puck to the back of the net!  The only good thing about the Sens was seeing Carrie Underwood-Fisher in the stands!!!!!!! Go Leafs Go!
517131,Headhunter,2010-11-03 14:50:00,5703,I would hazard a bet that there were a number of Sens fans wearing a hole in their couches during the last ten minutes of last nights game! And I would also bet that most Leaf fans have become so used to their losing ways that last nights loss is nothing more than yet another distant memory... HH
517148,johnnyb,2010-11-03 15:51:00,3413,"I prefer to look at the so-called ""battle of Ontario"" from a broader perspective.  The way I see it, after 2 battles, the war isn't won yet, and the score currently sits at LEAFS 7   SENS 4    "
517166,Garry2Rs,2010-11-03 17:32:00,1425,   Wait a minute!  For most of those 81 years Ottawa didn't have a team... Unless you're saying that neither did Toronto...hahaha
517266,wallyboss,2010-11-03 23:46:00,1095," The best reply so far, Thanks for the laugh garry2r"
517295,kickingfrog,2010-11-04 01:06:00,8333," 11 Stanley Cups, too bad Garry, you're old enough to remember just about all of them."
517329,jjcanoe,2010-11-04 03:35:00,744,"yup what a big league town! just ask the Rough Riders, uh bad example, I meant the Lynx, oops sorry! too soon?  Pro soccer is coming to Ottawa if only they had a stadium that wasn't condemned! there's always the 67's oh wait they're only a junior team..... but at least they get some support!!  If the sens had some maybe they would have had a team all those years when the Leafs were winning cups.  If the sens put in a few more decades maybe, just maybe they'll win a cup in a league with more than 4 teams  jjcanoe"
517332,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-11-04 03:53:00,0,"as a sens fan, i just gotta say, why are sens and leafs fans so obsessed with each other? the sens haven't been competitive since the cup run.  leafs haven't been competitive since the lockout.  yet we obsess about each other.  honestly, i look forward to a time where our teams are competitive at the same time again, but in the mean time, let's focus on the real enemy... THE CANADIENS!"
517361,jbailey,2010-11-04 13:05:00,866,"it was sad to hear the number of people who turned the game off after the second missing the comeback! The monster (worst nickname ever) made some amazing saves, but with a shootout line up like washingtons theres not to many goalies who can contend"
517374,johnnyb,2010-11-04 13:40:00,3413," No way, no how am I going be joining forces with a filthy Sens fan just because we share a common rival.  I can at least respect the Canadiens....enemy or not.  You just stay on your side of the line, Doc!"
517379,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-11-04 13:51:00,0, what line is that?  8th in the east and up?
517407,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-11-04 15:34:00,0,"that's really interesting... seems most leafers i know hate the sens and all, but their primary rival in montreal.  seems with the history between the two, they'd be the most hated.  i'm actually honoured!"
517429,craigdritchie,2010-11-04 17:08:00,1586,C'mon Leaf fans ... just get used to it.
