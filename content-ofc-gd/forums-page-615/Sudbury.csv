517430,jbailey,2010-11-04 17:09:00,866,"  kind of a misleading statistic, if it was more specific to Sudbury and not the larger area as well it may be ranked differently. Much like how Durham Region manages to sweep Oshawa under the rug."

517442,Fishnwire,2010-11-04 17:37:00,983,"When I lived down south I learned that Sudbury had a reputation as a ""rough town""...full of bikers and thugs...people seem to think violent crime is an ever present and unavoidable fact of life up here. - Unless you go looking for trouble...picking fights in bars, dealing or buying dope, those kind of things...you'll be fine.  I leave my car unlocked at night and I wouldn't worry about my wife being unescorted most places and times. - The one big difference is down south when someone says something like ""Back off or I'll punch you in the face.""...they are most likely just mouthing off.  If you hear that up north and you don't take it seriously, there's a decent chance you're about to be punched in the face.  That goes back to what I was saying about not going looking for trouble."
516222,livinisfishin,2010-10-30 22:27:00,661,Hey just looking for information on sudbury thanks !  Jason
516225,irishfield,2010-10-30 22:42:00,26272,Make sure you have a place to live before committing! 0.5% vacancy...
516226,livinisfishin,2010-10-30 22:49:00,661,Is it that hard to find a place to rent?
516245,Nipfisher,2010-10-30 23:54:00,2449,North Bay is WAYYYYYY nicer
516247,canadadude,2010-10-31 00:00:00,769,"My buddy just came down from Sudbury this week, he tells me it's booming up there right now,as with alot of minning towns in the North"
516294,Dara,2010-10-31 03:25:00,3052,The only people that like Sudbury are the ones that have never lived anywhere else
516306,cranks bait,2010-10-31 09:05:00,721,"I'm not from sudbury.  I drove past that black hole lots when I would go out west.  Then about 10 years ago I went to visit and was amazed at how green it was,I couldn't believe the work they had done.  I really enjoyed it there.  The outdoors is great.  I was also hanging with a ""special"" friend so that may have had something to do with it as well?"
516318,livinisfishin,2010-10-31 12:13:00,661,Thanks for the replies so far!
516391,nofish4me,2010-10-31 17:30:00,404,Sudbury was a great place (years since I've lived there) to be from. Outdoor activities are at most 20 minutes away. I lived there for six years. I would move back in a minute if I could do what I do on a daily basis for work. Winter can be down right horrible if you're not into outdoor winter activities.
516393,livinisfishin,2010-10-31 17:35:00,661,Decent fishing?
516394,nofish4me,2010-10-31 17:58:00,404,"Yes, but I'm more into the ""going fishing"". You could be in the middle of nowhere within 30 minutes or less, from downtown. Endless locations for good fishing in any direction."
516396,Handlebarz,2010-10-31 18:02:00,3790,Lots of great fishing right in town and with in 1 hour any direction you will find 100's of lakes and rivers to fish from. There is a great bunch of guys with MCI who have the Sudbury chapter of Muskies Canada they do many outings and are all great people.  I lived there for around 13 years and it was great I would like to get back up in the area again one day. If your into the outdoors you will find a lot to keep you going. Dont worry about what they Sault boys say they are mad that they get all the snow and hate the fact that Sudbury misses most of the big storms but can travel to the good areas LOL.
516397,nofish4me,2010-10-31 18:09:00,404,"....and you'd just be a mere 30 minute drive from the ""Creator"" of this fine place."
516415,livinisfishin,2010-10-31 20:28:00,661,Well as long as the fishing is good I'm in  .
516471,Canuck,2010-11-01 00:56:00,491,"I lived in Sudbury (Garson actually) from about 1975 to 1981 (yes I'm that old).  The problem for visitors to Sudbury is the highways go through the areas worst damaged by the nickel smelting before they put up the superstack.  Its a lot nicer now since when I lived there, but it is still greener away from the highways.  If you like the outdoors, Sudbury is a great place.  There is good fishing all around.  The north branches of the French river are not too far away as is the west end of Nipissing. Short drive up 144 towards Timmins gets you into some fantastic areas too.  Lake Wanipatei is a big body of water near Sudbury with reasonably good fishing.  Winters are pretty cold so make sure you buy a good snow mobile and enjoy it!  If you live on the outskirts of Sudbury you will be able to snow machine out your driveway and go as far as you want to.  It was a great place to live when you are young."
516476,AverageJoeFishing,2010-11-01 01:06:00,70,"If it was me I'd look into north bay... Nicer,cleaner town  and less population around 60 000 - 70 000 approx. but thats my opinion and theres lots of awesome fishing from 5 min to 1h30 away theres lakes all over!!"
516486,adempsey,2010-11-01 01:44:00,1498,"BEST chicken wings EVER at Grumblers, especially the hottest ones.  I made it my mission to stop here from now on when I go anywhere near Sudbury.  Probably not the info you're looking for, but that's all I got."
516543,Fishnwire,2010-11-01 10:40:00,983,"  I'm sorry, but what a stupid thing to say.  I know lots of people who moved away in the mid nineties when the economy here was bad and they are moving back in droves.  That's part of the reason for the low vacancy rate that was spoken of.  I left Sudbury in 1996 and spend about 5 years living in the 905 and 519 areas.  For me, life up north beats life down south in every reason that matters.  I'm home."
516548,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-11-01 11:42:00,0,"I really enjoyed Sudbury. Peaceful place. The only problem I heard was with bears(Yet I didn't get to see one!), so hope you own a boat or carry your shot gun fishing deep in the bush! Lots of places to fish for sure."
516569,Governator,2010-11-01 13:05:00,879,"Did a fishing trip to one of the lakes up there in the Spring.  Nature is beautiful in the area, lakes in all directions too.  Saw my first ever bear about 5min from the boat launch."
516618,Fish4Eyes,2010-11-01 15:26:00,1022,"When I was up north this past summer, I spoke to a young fella who was from Sudbury and he said it was full of mafia and punk kids who will mug you and stomp you out just for the kick of it if walking on the streets at night."
516631,Jer,2010-11-01 15:54:00,1426,   ...so not much different than most other cities then...
516635,Governator,2010-11-01 16:03:00,879,"  ""In a recent release from Statistics Canada on crime statistics for 2007, Greater Sudbury saw a 9.3 per cent decrease from the previous year, essentially making it the fifth safest metropolitan area (100,000 to less than 500,000 population) in Canada.""  http://www.northernlife.ca/News/PoliceandCourt/2008/07-21-08-crimeTOP.aspx"
516644,crappieperchhunter,2010-11-01 16:37:00,2582, I have family up there. If you are real serious about a move up there PM me. Might be able to help you out.
516763,livinisfishin,2010-11-02 00:25:00,661,Couple of days and ill be going up there for a look around. Make some decisions based on what I see! Thanks for all of the great info so far guys!
