517108,lew,2010-11-03 13:14:00,12766,Whenever I'm heading down to LSC I always stop at the ESSO station on the westbound 401 near London to gas up the truck and get something to eat. Coming home I stop at the ESSO on the eastbound for the same thing.  Does anyone know if their both still open for business or have they closed down like so many other 400 series stations.
517109,jjcanoe,2010-11-03 13:21:00,744,Westbound is open Eastbound is a big hole in the ground...uh actually the hole has been filled in but still no construction yet!  jjcanoe
517110,lew,2010-11-03 13:27:00,12766,"Thanks jj, I appreciate that."
517112,SmokestackLightnin,2010-11-03 13:29:00,390,"Lew:  This should help, it tells you which ones are fully closed, which ones are open with limitations and which ones are fully open:  http://www.mto.gov.o...d-answers.shtml"
517140,SlowPoke,2010-11-03 15:30:00,2984,"Lew, my advice would be to avoid fueling near London.... around $1.06/lt Tilbury is your best bet around $.98/lt. When I go to LSC I stop at Bloomfield Rd. Esso in Chatham (100yrds south of 401) for gas usually about .01 more than Tilbury but they have a nice store, bathrooms and a 24hr Subway so you can buy your lunch at the same time."
517183,Dave Bailey,2010-11-03 18:36:00,1641, I'll second that. I travel to Windsor frequently and I always stop at the Pilot on the west side of Tilbury. Cheapest gas on the route.
517200,misfish,2010-11-03 19:32:00,29133,"If you want to eat Lew and gas up,I would recommend the Flying J in London.JMO.  It,s right off the hwy,2 minutes. I go there everytime I have to visit our customer Brose.  http://www.restaurantica.com/on/london/flying-j-country-market/23503679/map/"
517204,lew,2010-11-03 19:44:00,12766,Thanks for all the suggestions boyz !!  Travelling would be much easier if they'd stop tearing down all the service centers
517209,misfish,2010-11-03 20:01:00,29133,"  As much as I love the ol truck stops Lew(greasy bacon and eggs  ),they are in need of upgrading or rebuilding."
517234,SlowPoke,2010-11-03 21:42:00,2984,"All the service centres west of London are open. The Flying J is no more. It is now a Shell gas bar with a Denny's (still under construction) The ""J"" gas deal is gone too; they're as much as in town and they no longer have Flying J discount card. Fortunately for those that know, 10 minutes south of the J, gas is 6-8 cents cheaper."
517246,misfish,2010-11-03 22:11:00,29133, WOW since when Brian? I was there just a couple months ago.
517250,Squid,2010-11-03 22:37:00,1656,Yeah the service centres are up and running down that way Lew. And on the way back.
517338,SlowPoke,2010-11-04 06:04:00,2984,"They must have waitied until you left! Actually, its been Shell for a while (Air Miles) and the sign is up for Denny's in the last week but they're still doing interior construction. London FINALLY gets the 'Grand Slam' breakfast and $6.00 onion rings Next time you're in the area; give me a ring, I live about a minute north of there."
517339,splashhopper,2010-11-04 06:59:00,2931, Lousy food at Flying J... expensive gas too. ( from another Londoner )
517342,Handlebarz,2010-11-04 08:59:00,3790,For the guys and girls heading this way this weekend the Sub Way at Bloomfield road put up a sign for Saturday and Sunday deals buy 1 foot long get the second FREE all weekend. and the price in Chatham is just as Brian was saying about the same as Tilbury.  Now the service centers in Westlorn area have KFC Timmies Taco hell and A&W on both sides of the HWy.
517343,lew,2010-11-04 09:36:00,12766," Well,  now I know what I'm gonna be eating on the loooong drive home Sunday evening  Thanks Mike, hope to see you down there."
