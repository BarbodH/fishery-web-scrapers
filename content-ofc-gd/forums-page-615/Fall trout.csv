517487,Guest JPCT,2010-11-04 20:53:00,0,I was there Sunday.. It was good.  I hit something big and it swam in between my legs...almost knocked me over... what a rush!  I would have stayed longer but I had a hole in my waders from the day before... lol..  That pic is pretty recognizable

517597,thebigcatch,2010-11-05 01:57:00,138,Between the legs lol that's a good one haha  I was there to day got one about 13 lb  Yeah it is recognizable a bit just for the ppl who knows the spot tho
517675,solopaddler,2010-11-05 13:23:00,8605,"That spot is one of my pet peeves.  They're poor excuses for fish ladders but there is one on each side of that dam.  It's illegal to fish within 75' of the downstream edge of any fishladder or fishway.  All you guys that fish there are doing so illegally. You can check it out if you want, it's right in the regs.  Sooo many people do it with total impunity that it seems to be accepted practice.  I'm guessing that most people don't even realize they're breaking the law.  I've called the MNR many times on this but apparantly they don't care..  (For what it's worth there's far better spots for steelhead further downstream anyway)"
