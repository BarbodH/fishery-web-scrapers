516516,bigugli,2010-11-01 02:50:00,6138,Thanks to CPH for another very successful perch expedition. Despite dark skies and snow showers the bite was definitely on. Here is Rockfish with a nice one.  A satisfying end result of quality keepers. Enough for 4 or 5 meals.  Even learned a few new tricks today despite almost falling out of the boat
516518,irishfield,2010-11-01 02:52:00,26272,MMMMMM FOOD !
516520,bigugli,2010-11-01 02:55:00,6138,Careful Wayne. Start developing an appetite like mine and that plane of yours will never get off the ground
516578,canadadude,2010-11-01 13:15:00,769,"ugli why travel to scugog, you can catch twice that 15min from your home, the bite on Lake O has been the best in years  I havn't even got the trout rod out once this year, to good a perch bite to mess with Brownies and Rainbows yet hahahahaha"
516583,toca,2010-11-01 13:40:00,274,theres perch in lake ontario?
516597,crappieperchhunter,2010-11-01 14:28:00,2582,Yep another fine day telling fishing stories. With just enough interruptions from the perch to call it a fishing trip You scared me good when you almost went swimming. I was having a hard time figuring out how we would get you out of the water and still be able to fish for the rest of the afternoon
516630,Beans,2010-11-01 15:52:00,3339, I thought it was only Albert that tried to use people as an anchor...   
516640,mercman,2010-11-01 16:22:00,7054,nice healthy looking bunch a morcels !!! That'll be a nice meal.
516653,bigugli,2010-11-01 17:09:00,6138,Can't believe I actually let go of the fishing rod.
516697,Leecher,2010-11-01 19:35:00,7832,"Guess it's safe to say ""you can teach an old dog a new trick"" Sounds like fun Bruce Nice haul by the way Thanks for sharing Jacques"
516722,rockfish,2010-11-01 21:19:00,91,Thanks for the trip guys and I gotta pick me up some of those Fin-s minnows we were doing so good with. It was good to get away from the old neighborhood and try a different spot.  Note to self and CPH: Bruce always needs to be remained seated in the boat !!!
516834,crappieperchhunter,2010-11-02 12:41:00,2582,  Dave I'm glad you enjoyed the road trip.  Next time we will strap Bruce down
516862,Beans,2010-11-02 14:54:00,3339, Don't forget to get the Fin-S 1/16 oz. jigs to go with the minnows...

517069,crappieperchhunter,2010-11-03 05:38:00,2582,"  If you can tell where we are on the  lake from Bruce's one picture...well then you have been there and you already know ""The spot""  It shouldn't matter to you anyway Ted...seeing as your too lazy to drag a tinny in there anyway  Hey... you started it"
517096,Beans,2010-11-03 12:36:00,3339," I knows...But I ain't telling...  ""drag"" is the key word in that sentence for sure...   "
517293,kingofthesteelhead,2010-11-04 00:55:00,140,"my goodness,this is starting to sound like other message boards. A little touchy or what!Over and out."
