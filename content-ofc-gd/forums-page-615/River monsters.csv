517044,Dozer,2010-11-03 02:16:00,896,"I've seen a real sweet clip about these, their babies form a wall and cruise around eating plankton and other small critters, and they take turns to run the front, amazing stuff.  I want to see some slow motion feeding footage"
517071,Stern Rules,2010-11-03 07:31:00,342,I caught the last 10 mins. That last fish was huge.
517076,IndySKS,2010-11-03 10:31:00,134,There is previews on youtube of some of the episodes.  I missed the last 20 min just couldn't stay awake
517079,MCTFisher9120,2010-11-03 11:14:00,3761,I watched it. Very interesting show I thought
517091,Lunker777,2010-11-03 12:19:00,866,This is why I want American Satellite ! This show has been on the air for over a year already..... only in the states though !  Still a sweet show !
517153,MJL,2010-11-03 16:29:00,2427,"Love the series.  It’s been out for quite some time.  My friends in the UK sent me a copy of it about a year ago.  Great footage and good narrative by Jeremy Wade.  If you’re a fan of the River Monster series and are a fishing bum or adventure junky, try to find Jeremy Wade’s DVD titled “Jungle Hooks”. He goes into the Amazon for Arapaima (Like in River Monsters), and goes to India for golden mahseer and Goonch catfish in another – I liked those a little more than River Monsters (Especially the India one).  There’s some brilliant fishing programs in the UK that put a lot of what we watch here in North America to shame."
517157,mercman,2010-11-03 16:48:00,7054, i have bell satelite and its there in one of the packages.
517160,Dutchy,2010-11-03 17:04:00,416,I watched bits of the program. Very cool. Wouldn't want to mess with one of those though
517165,mercman,2010-11-03 17:26:00,7054,"i couldnt believe for such a huge fish, how well it could fly through the air !! Now thats manly fishin !!!  "
517181,Lunker777,2010-11-03 18:28:00,866," I guess i should have been more specific, I currently have EXPRESSVU... but I want to get american satelite because this show has been out in the states for over a year now ! Along with many other good shows, only available in the US !!  I have pretty well every channel you can get from Bell, except the movie channels ( waste of money ) and other then the odd showing here and there... it hasn't had a dedicated spot on Canadian TV !  Its a great show and usually when I travle to the states for work, they have it playing alot on Discovery... ill catch a few episodes !"
517269,mercman,2010-11-04 00:02:00,7054,"if you misssed it last nite, its on again tonite at 9 on discovery"
