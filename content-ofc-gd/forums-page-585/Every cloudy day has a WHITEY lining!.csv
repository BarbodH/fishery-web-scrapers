542951,Meely,2011-01-24 01:40:00,282,"Well......  Me and 2 fishing buddies decided to brave the ccccccccold and venture out for some white-fish hunting. We made our way to Simcoe and ran the sleds out of IBP. Arrived at one of our honey-holes at 9 am , 85 FOW, and commenced fishing.  Jigged......Jigged ......and Jigged for 3 hours......... ZIP!!  Lots of fish being marked on the Vexi's but no takers!  Then at noon it was as if someone began to ring the ""WHITEY CHOW BELL"" ......and we began to hook fish STEADY!!! The action continued for approximately an hour and then went dead again!  Within that time we iced 6 Whiteys and one VERY nice laker.  I guess perseverence does pay off.  Here are the results of our efforts:    Meely"
542957,crappieperchhunter,2011-01-24 01:46:00,2582,Nice job big guy   I actually drove all the way to Innisfil today and then turned around and drove all the way back home. The Golf was acting a bit weird...fuel gelling up maybe  it has happened to me before and I thought leaving it out in the cold all day would not be a good idea. 280 KM round trip and I never got my gear out of the car.  But at least I saved myself $10 on parking
