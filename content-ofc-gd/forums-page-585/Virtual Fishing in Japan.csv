543408,I'mHooked,2011-01-25 13:46:00,525,You beat me to it! Was just going to post myself.  It'd be pretty funny sitting on a park bench and making people think you were throwing something at them when all you were doing was fishing!

543435,hammercarp,2011-01-25 15:22:00,964,Do you think P3TA will be offering a cash rebate on these. It's perfect for those that are strict C&R anglers.
