If this has already been discussed here please post the topic link thanks. This is a very short read and many other sites get more in depth. It's the last paragraph that bothers me. To me this is a Government agency selling access to a private company(s) on crown land. It just doesn't sit well even if the ""Majority"" of lands are accessable by all. Close the roads and keep it remote but don't deny access by other means  http://www.ctv.ca/CTVNews/Canada/20110123/crown-land-blocked-110123/  Has anyone else heard of the Ontario Outdoors Recreational Alliance?"
