542700,Cudz,2011-01-23 14:53:00,2652,I sae the thread about Brad Paisley's song so I decidede to share my fave fishing song. It sounds alot like Carrie Underwood's Jesus take the wheel. LOL Tim Hawkins is a funny dude.  THis may have been posted before but I still laugh everytime I watch it.   Upper thigh injury is a classic.
542704,Cudz,2011-01-23 14:59:00,2652,"While I am at it I might as well post his classic ""Things you don't say to your wife"".  He still mentions hunting and fishing so this might be my second favourite fishing song. lol   If you have never heard this song, listen to it.  Short and sweet."
