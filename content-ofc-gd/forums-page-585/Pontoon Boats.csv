The boat will in all likelyhood not be trailered often, if at all. He is considering a boat in the 16 ft range and has asked me for opinions on what to consider. To date, he has looked at Legend boats, but is interested in what else is out there that could fit his needs. Looking forward to receiving your insight here guys... and appreciate your help. HH"

The one I drove had a 25 Yamaha on it - no worries about losing your hat, but for around $15k it was a really nicely made boat.  http://www.g3boats.com/Sun_Catcher_LV_168_FC  It also comes in an electric version, for lakes with gas outboard restrictions:  http://www.g3boats.com/Sun_Catcher_LV_168_FC_Electric"
543394,blue pickeral,2011-01-25 09:59:00,267,"If he needs something simple for a small lake, he may consider building a prefab model from U Fab - http://u-fabboats.com  They are in Smith Falls, ON. Saved some shipping by picking up myself from outlet.  In a similar situation, got a 14 by 8 foot model which moves well with a 9.9 horse. As well, was able to add my own features without a lot of useless trim. After three years, no problems, even when pontoons accidentally frozen into ice over winter.  Very easy to assemble - actually stopped to read directions half way through as job was going too well. Only downside is that if you want to insure it, you have to get a marine surveyor to inspect and certify it. There is nothing to hit where I am so didn't bother.  Approximate costs: -frame/pontoons from UFab $3,000.00 -3 sheets 3/4"" marine ply @ $150.00 -1 sheet 3/4"" TP plywood $50.00 -2 seats/pedestals $170.00 -paint tremclad 1.5 gallons $50.00 -side rails to hang stuff - material at hand"
543429,bigbuck,2011-01-25 15:01:00,2449,Pretty much any of the manufacturer's make decent pontoon boats. He needs a smallish one with a 25hp on the back. It doesn't need to be fast. He just needs to check out a few dealers and see which layout suits his needs the best.
543439,Headhunter,2011-01-25 15:30:00,5703,"First of all, thanks to all who have replied to this thread and to those who have PM'd me... I spoke with him this morning and he is considering what you guys have said... He seems to be leaning toward try before you buy and will in all likelyhood, be test driving them in the spring. Does anyone have any experience with Legend boats? If you'd rather not discuss thisn in the open forum, please feel free to PM me.. Thanks HH"
