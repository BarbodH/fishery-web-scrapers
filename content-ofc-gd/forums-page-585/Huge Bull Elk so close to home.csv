543301,T Fisher,2011-01-25 01:35:00,139,I couldn't belive what my eye were telling me a huge bull elk standing not 60m away he was massive what a rack has anyone seen this guy just south of the town of ZEPHER.
543311,Terry,2011-01-25 02:06:00,14456,do you think he was from an elk farm or wild
543319,Twocoda,2011-01-25 02:15:00,4130,if he was from a farm ...he would have a federal band in his ear (shiny silver metal strap) or a rip in his ear where it used to be ..did you get a pic?
543320,daryl0815,2011-01-25 02:16:00,225,"I would guess its from a farm, just like the Emu's I see just north of Whitby!"
543326,archer379,2011-01-25 02:38:00,277,there are wild elk as far south as norwood wouldnt surprize me if it was wild
543403,turtle,2011-01-25 12:57:00,274,"I live about 20 minutes south of that farm.  When I first saw the 2 bull elk there I stopped a had to do a double take - 500 lb whitetail with massive rack?  Both are farm not wild elk, there is also a llama or two there.  Very impressive animals."
543586,T Fisher,2011-01-26 00:38:00,139, Thanks guys that animal was massive what a rack.
