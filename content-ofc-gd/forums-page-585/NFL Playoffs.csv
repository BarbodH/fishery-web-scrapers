540383,Billy Bob,2011-01-17 11:28:00,5865,Packers vs Steelers....Steelers win Superbowl or Timmy's is on me...
540390,solopaddler,2011-01-17 12:14:00,8605,"Pretty impressive secondary the Jets have. Sent Manning and Brady packing in consecutive weeks, not sure if I'd bet against them."
540394,Grimace,2011-01-17 12:20:00,2020,Lets keep all of our Walleye fishing cousins in Wisconsin happy and go Packers over the Steelers.
542742,BUSTER,2011-01-23 16:17:00,1336,A few more hours and the popcorn will be flying!!!  whooot whoot  Any predictions?
542749,misfish,2011-01-23 16:42:00,29133,Green Bay vs Jets super bowl. Sorry Marty
542751,Billy Bob,2011-01-23 16:45:00,5865,Super Bowl = Steelers vs Packers  STEELERS win Super Bowl  Boring times ahead until ice melts or baseball starts...
542755,danc,2011-01-23 16:56:00,4677,"Bears, Jets in the SB. Jets will win."
542850,Dutchy,2011-01-23 20:22:00,416,Packers and Steelers. Steelers win SB.
542909,BUSTER,2011-01-23 23:17:00,1336,PACKERS WIN AND ARE OFF TO SUPERBOWL
542910,Twocoda,2011-01-23 23:20:00,4130,the bears made a game of it though ...too bad they got pickedoff on the final run...
542986,BUSTER,2011-01-24 02:50:00,1336,IT WILL BE  STEELERS VS PACKERS FOR SUPERBOWL 45
542992,Twocoda,2011-01-24 03:10:00,4130,if the Jets had of showed up for the first half ...it could of been more interesting ...but they made a game of it though ...lol...im starting to sound like a repeat of gilligans island...  Steelers for the SB
532409,FUSION,2010-12-28 21:14:00,81,With the season comming to a close in a few weeks just seeing who everyone's pics are for the playoffs this year... Who do you think is going all the way???
532419,BUSTER,2010-12-28 21:53:00,1336,Bears?
532423,Dusky,2010-12-28 22:14:00,310,KC Chiefs or Patriots
532436,Billy Bob,2010-12-28 23:06:00,5865, The Chiefs would be a GREAT surprise and I would love to see it but I highly doubt it....probably the arrogant Patriots.
532496,kingofthesteelhead,2010-12-29 02:03:00,140,"Like those Patriots but after last night don't count out those Saints,Drew Brees always seems to find a way to win!"
532499,fishinguypat,2010-12-29 02:28:00,547,My Eagles will shine
532501,Dusky,2010-12-29 02:30:00,310,Agree chiefs would be a surprise but the way they are playing I will put them above jets/colts/steelers. Could be a patriot/chiefs AFC match up and and Patriot/Saints Superbowl.
532516,Cudz,2010-12-29 03:10:00,2652,I like the way the Pats are playing and Atl looks good despite their loss to the Saints. Don't ever rule out Indy.
532523,Billy Bob,2010-12-29 03:21:00,5865,"I'll bet a dozen nightcrawlers if the Colts play the Chiefs, at the end of the day the Chiefs will be on the outside looking in..."
532525,Pikeslayer,2010-12-29 03:25:00,1443,New Orleans Saints. Money in the bank.
532526,ctdd2006,2010-12-29 03:27:00,531, I wouldn't take that bet.  I agree the colts are dangerous and experienced.  Don't count my Packers out if they get in they'll make some noise!  Go Pack!
532528,FUSION,2010-12-29 03:33:00,81, Don't agree with Billy Bob on trucks but I agree with him 100% on that statement!
532529,BUSTER,2010-12-29 03:33:00,1336,lol go toyota
532530,NAC,2010-12-29 03:40:00,369,"  I'll take that bet. It's a lot of years of playoff redemption for the Chiefs vs the Colts, and the Colts are ripe for a loss.  Goes back before Manning when Harbaugh was QB and the Colts had no business beating them at home in '93.  I'm thinking the winner of the AFC over the Eagles for the SB."
532540,snoil,2010-12-29 10:50:00,139,Lions!! Next year!
532541,Billy Bob,2010-12-29 11:14:00,5865, I have it on good info that Peyton Manning drives a Toyota Tundra....  (actually I just made that up)  Toyota Bob...
532578,blaque,2010-12-29 16:40:00,2419, One more reason to drive a ford........or to just not drive a toyota
532584,Billy Bob,2010-12-29 16:54:00,5865," Here we go again.....  HAPPY NEW YEAR, Toyota Billy"
532626,fishyfingers,2010-12-29 18:28:00,46,STEELERS!!!
532631,blaque,2010-12-29 18:45:00,2419, Isnt roethliesburgererer still trying to shake the cobwebs from that uppercut to his mouth?
532656,BUSTER,2010-12-29 20:25:00,1336,HE'S still a very good QB right up there with Montana. Very seasoned vet.
532676,blaque,2010-12-29 21:43:00,2419,"As much as id like to, Im not going to hi-jack the thread with my opinion of the guy off the field."
532695,Billy Bob,2010-12-29 22:22:00,5865," For my money if I had to choose a QB to command my playoff team and taking everything into consideration including off field behaver, then Peyton Manning is heads and shoulders above every other QB in the NFL right now.  Too bad other players don't have his ethics and manors. Today in the NFL most players are about themselves...LOOK AT ME..LOOK AT ME... I made a tackle or caught a pass for 8 yards, forgetting about all the bone head plays they did that put their team behind by 20 points or more. JUST PLAY THE DAMN GAME ALREADY."
532773,moparhawk,2010-12-30 00:43:00,146, Take that bet Nomad. Even though the chiefs lost to Indy earlier if they meet in the playoffs it will   be at Arrowhead Stadium where the Chiefs are 7-0
532909,Marty,2010-12-30 15:43:00,873,"Knock, knock, knockin on SEVENs door!"
