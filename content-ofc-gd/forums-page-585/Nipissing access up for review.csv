Municipal politicians agreed to adopt a motion tabled by councillors Dave Mendicino and Daryl Vaillancourt directing staff to complete a comprehensive review of city owned accesses and make recommendations about how best to utilize the lands.   Mendicino said the lake access issue is one that has been simmering on the back burner for a number of years. He said he was warned not to take on the issue because it would be too controversial.""  But Mendicino suggested it's council's job to look at the approximately 45 access points, despite any contention that may be stirred up as a result.  He said many of the access points are road allowances, including some that have been encroached upon by abutting property owners, and others that haven't been maintained.  He said some along Lakeshore Drive are a stone's throw"" away from each other.  As a result of the review, Mendicino said he hopes to see access points that are well-used by the public designed as park land.  Likewise, he said something should be done with other accesses that aren't as well used or that have been taken over by an abutting home-owner.  It needs to be addressed,"" Mendicino said.  Although there was unanimous support for the motion, some councillors promised they're not interested in selling off access points.  Others said they initially had concerns about the motion, but offered their support because its intent isn't simply to identify lands that can be sold.  I am not in favour of selling off any access points,"" said Coun. Tanya Vrebosch-Merry, noting she's interested in knowing what access points have been encroached upon.  Coun. Mike Anthony said he's not interested in selling any public access either.  Some councillors noted the review may be an opportunity to improve signage and clean up some access points that haven't been maintained.  I think it's high time it got done,"" said Coun. Judy Koziol, noting there are some points that don't provide access to the lake because they have been taken over by abutting owners or are too overgrown.  [emailÂ protected]"
