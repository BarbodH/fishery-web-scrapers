543401,BITEME,2011-01-25 12:43:00,1968,Just a thought if you get the serial number and model of the motor you can get a full carb rebuild kit at any shop for about $20 i just did my old craftsman (techumsec snow commander 1979) takes about an hour well worth the money the old brass floats sometimes admit a little fuel in the float the brazing cracks whatever and it throws the bouyancy off the new version is thermal plastic i would rather brass but what you gonna do anyway it runs like a champ Just a thought Peter
542837,strik,2011-01-23 19:52:00,175,Hey guys/girls Just looking for a little help my 10hp(older) snowblower will run  fine for about one to two  minuts then it just dies like it is starving for gas if you reprime it it will run again then just dies .. Have stable in it also just added deicer Anyone have any ideas  Thanks Skrik
542841,T Fisher,2011-01-23 20:00:00,139, A couple of taps on the carb with a screw driver the plastic end. Come spring clean the carb.

542855,Sinker,2011-01-23 20:33:00,8692,"Could also be a weak coil. Do you have to wait for it to cool down before it will start again, or just re-prime it? If you just need to reprime it, could be the fuel pump I suppose.  S."
542856,Sinker,2011-01-23 20:34:00,8692,Keep pumping the primer once its running and see if it will keep going.......  S.

542860,BillM,2011-01-23 21:00:00,17367,Floats in the carb bowl are most likely stuck.
542864,strik,2011-01-23 21:02:00,175,
542866,Leecher,2011-01-23 21:06:00,7832,Did you have full choke on??  Mine will die if I don't take the choke off after it ran for a couple of minutes???
542867,Sinker,2011-01-23 21:06:00,8692," Yup, or a leaky fuel line, or weak pump.  Do you have to wait for it to cool down before it will start again?  S."
542868,strik,2011-01-23 21:13:00,175,  no but do have to prime the hell out of it  it seem it will run longer if choke is at half
542870,Leecher,2011-01-23 21:21:00,7832,Try another spark plug and see.
542871,strik,2011-01-23 21:30:00,175,  crap i never even thought it would be that because it would run and start so well i will get and try a new plug tomorrow i did look at the plug it looks blk and old  but it still seem to be a fule issue is it possiple i have ice in it and as i prime it  the gas is forced through?    To eveyone thanks a lot of all of the ideas Strik
542872,BillM,2011-01-23 21:39:00,17367," Definitely fueling, like I mentioned before, take the carb off, give it a good clean and make sure the floats aren't stuck.  If they are, the bowl will never fill will fuel and the motor will just stall out.  This is why it's running when you prime it or use the choke, those both bypass the bowl and go directly into the engine."
542874,Leecher,2011-01-23 21:45:00,7832," Try to clean the plug as best you can and fire it up again.... if it behave the same, than you have other issues that's beyond my knowledge.... may be Big Cliff or Bernie of this site can help you with this. Leechman"
542878,ChrisK,2011-01-23 21:50:00,2772,"Heres another thing that made my old Craftsman blower run funny. In the throttle/choke box there are two wires. One going to the choke and the other to the throttle. Take off the box and inspect the wires for loose connectors or signs of shorting out. If one or the other is shorting out this ""may"" make your blower shut down after it warms up just after start up or do things like not throttle down or choke properly or run at all.  Good Luck !!"
542884,Woodsman,2011-01-23 22:05:00,1286,Had the same problem here with a 6 hp B&S. Was the fuel cap. Vent hole was plugged. Cheap fix & even if it's not the problem you'll not be out much $.(just over $3)
542890,strik,2011-01-23 22:19:00,175,"  I look at the cap  there is NO vent hole i assume  it is the original.. BUT BUT here is the thing  i have taken it off and tryed to start it it started fine like always, waited the two min and figured here we go ..... it is still going it has been about 5 min but that makes no snice to me  assuming  this is the issue why would it have ran so good for 3 years and just now dies ??"
542945,skeeter,2011-01-24 01:35:00,1907,there HAS to be a vent on the fuel tank or the fuel will NOT get out of the tank.
542947,BillM,2011-01-24 01:35:00,17367," Yup, gotta let gravity do her thing, lol."
542952,jigger08,2011-01-24 01:41:00,38,"Sounds like a hole or crack in the fuel pump diaphram....Had an identical issue with a rototiller a few years back.Diaphram won't keep up to the motor at any speed above idle,but priming bypasses the diaphram.Good luck."
543193,bigbuck,2011-01-24 22:33:00,2449,"Pour a bit of Seafoam right down the throat of the carb, let it sit for a couple of minutes and then tap the bottom of the carb with a small hammer or the plastic end of a screwdriver. More than likely, it's just a stuck float in the carb. If it works, remember to pour some stabilizer in your jerry can of snowblower gas. Better to be safe than sorry. It will help to keep the fuel system clean and your gas always fresh."
543194,strik,2011-01-24 22:35:00,175,hey guys new plug/ clean bottom bowl / spray down wires around carb  seem to be runing good will have to wait until another work out  to make sure. Still havent figured out where the hole is for the gas cap or the tank  but it seen to be running fine with the cap on . Thanks to all who tryed to help Strik
543385,nofish4me,2011-01-25 04:22:00,404," No hole in the gas cap, to prevent moisture (snow) getting into gas. It is done through the gasket in the cap."
