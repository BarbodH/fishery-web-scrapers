542938,Big Cliff,2011-01-24 01:23:00,6899," Same sort of thing got an access point to Sturgeon Lake closed last year, garbage, used toilet paper, just thrown on the ground. The locals got tired of having to clean it up.  Beans and I went to a spot a couple of years ago to do a little shore fishing, we spent about 1/2 an hour cleaning up garbage even though there were garbage cans sitting right there, the previous anglers had just thrown their stuff all over the ground.  Get used to seeing public access points closed because saddly I doubt it is going to get any better!"
542950,Joey,2011-01-24 01:40:00,9122,"Ya, but people litter everywhere.  I have cleaned up my fair share of other people's litter at fishing spots and it disgusts me, but there is litter all over the city/country and you can't close up everything because of it.  The Subway would never run again if that were the case!!!  Hmm, wonder if the locals are tossing litter to make it look like it's the anglers  I can't stop people from parking in front of my house or in the nearest parking lot so I can't understand how this bylaw was passed.  Don't think the locals need to park there either as they're ""local."""

Leaves me a spot for my truck and trailer at the launch"
542960,BillM,2011-01-24 01:56:00,17367," The parking lot has about 7 spots, it's full before 8am.    I'm surprised they even call it a parking lot.   Problem is ALL the roads around the area are posted as well, so nowhere to park."
542988,bigugli,2011-01-24 02:54:00,6138,"For the most part, we are the hard core of the fishing world. We live eat breath fishing. The average angler is a 2 week a year weekend warrior. Don't know the issues and don't care. Like most weekend warriors and their hobbies. See it camping, fishing, skidooing, cycling, golfing, etc... Too busy having fun to worry about the impact they are having. Used to having people clean up after them rather than cleaning up after themselves. With this prevalent attitude, get used to seeing trash. Get used to seeing angry residents. Get used to seeing restricted access. Other municipalities take another tack. Automated parking lots and user fees. I've seen the ticket meters in a few fishing locations as well. The sites were downloaded on municipalities that don't want to foot the bill. So visitors now pay."
542999,mukluk,2011-01-24 03:18:00,196,"Perhaps the Federation of Anglers and Hunters"" could send some letters of discontent towards the parking issues at BBP and lake access in general. They are the voice of average fisherpeople."
543005,crappieperchhunter,2011-01-24 03:36:00,2582, No one wants to pay Bruce...but given a choice I think most would rather pay then lose access. Like I mentioned in my earlier post though...existing infrastructure can rule this out in  a lot of cases.
543006,Grimace,2011-01-24 03:36:00,2020,"I use to fish 100 days a year (literally).  Now with a child I am a week end warrior.  I do not litter.  I do not take the issues with a grain of salt.  In fact I appreciate them more as my time is limited on the water.  Idiots litter.  It does not matter how far they drive or how much they fish or who they voted for or which team they cheer for.  I will guarantee one thing.  When this is all said and done the morning noise and the litter will not subside magically now that only the Innisfil residents are the only ones able to utilize that access.  The littering and the noise is not done by the evil city people.  Actually most of the out of towners that are dubbed the evil city people are in fact other rural people from other rural communities that do not have the luxury of having a lake at the back door.  This has nothing to do with litter and noise.  This has more to do with a municipal government securing votes.   edit  ""does"" to ""does not"" matter."
543008,bigugli,2011-01-24 04:18:00,6138,"And you are still, like me, part of a very small minority. Residents squawk and politicians listen, and the outsiders become the scapegoat. Whether the trouble is local or outsider does not matter. It will also help to line someone's pocket."
543009,chilli,2011-01-24 04:19:00,199,I sent my zone rep an email. The last time I did that in Niagara on the Lake the OFAH came right down to check out the area and met with the municipality presenting at a town meeting. Many of us on NFN also submitted letters to the town and some had it added to the minutes.  I spoke personally on the phone with the mayor who was very upset this was happening as he fished that spot for years. It was all in vain though and we lost. As we were all discussing the situation and the threat of starting a trend some ignorant slobs were filling the place with trash and crapping in the neighbours gardens. Yes they were fishermen and aside from the dinner plates and napkins left behind the next biggest item was fishing trash. We are a disgrace and we need to clean up our act.  Now only NOTL residents can get a permit to fish there.

I agree as a group we need to be more respectful and not litter, and show respect for locals. This isn't the reason for closing the government dock parking to non-residents at BBP.  I received a reply from the township of Innisfil. You can review what they had to say at this OFC link:  http://www.ofncommunity.com/forums/index.php?showtopic=50246"

As an Innisfi resident I some what agree, 10 bucks to use the park for ice fishing access is a little much, having to pay to launch and use the park/beach for the day I get, should see the mess left to clean up come Monday morning its insane!!! but in most cases the staff have the park back in great shape by noon (no doubt covered by user fees). Locals can be just as bad as non residents I have seen this first hand. There will always be idiots both local and non local that ruin it for everyone.  Those signs will start to appear in more places that is inevitable, but hopefully not to many. On a side note alot of those monster waterfront homes/water access homes are owned by out of town people, and they seem to whine the most LOL.

542888,chilli,2011-01-23 22:16:00,199,"  It was the slobs that closed Niagara on the Lake also. The Lake Erie side roads get trashed every year by these so called outdoorsmen. They can afford high end SUV's, ATV's, huts, and snowmobiles but they couldn't buy manners if you offered them for free. Never mind bylaws if I was a resident on this road I'd be slashing their tires!  Be careful about parking on the road as some municipalities have bylaws preventing this during the winter months. Check with the local hall first.  Aaron good on you for sending that letter and I will add my voice despite the tire slashing comment. I am an angler first but I recognize it's the disrespectful jerks among us who really do give us what we deserve. We not only need to lobby the government here but we need to lobby ourselves too. Too many of us see the littering going on or the guy revving the sled in front of someones house at early hours and we say nothing. Lets make sure we promote respect throughout the angling community. We can't say we're not at all at fault here as an angling community. Yes you have a right to launch your sled there but have some dam respect for the locals or this is going to start happening more and more. Get as mad as you want but until you realize you and your rights are not the only ones that matter your going to see this kind of thing continue.  On another note if we should be at all upset at the municipality we should be going after them for taking the easy route. In my letter I'll tell them I understand but greater efforts should be taken to deter this kind of behavour in the first place. Also I agree that this looks very unwelcoming to the entire municipality not just the dock and I will refuse to spend a dime there until they reverse it. Residents only is insulting. I still haven't spent any money in NOTL and I won't and I suggest neither does anybody here."
542900,siwash,2011-01-23 22:53:00,683,"Yes, parking on the ice gets around all of this!!!!! Ice is firm enough now..  I wnet to Inissfil beach today.. was not charged as it was after 12!!!!! No fish but had a good time.. nice day out there. tested my new hut/heater  cheers"

Does it get busy enough that it ever gets full?  Was getting a parking spot at 10 am on a Saturday possible or were guys from Toronto already in every spot?  I could see the municipality taking issue with local residents not being able to access a facility they pay for through taxes because it's full of ""outsiders""..."

542259,perchslayer666,2011-01-22 13:15:00,280,"Screw Lake Simcoe, fished there many times and I'm sick of the locals and many people from Toronto who make fishing there unpleasant.  I'll take my dollars elsewhere, obviously they have no idea about how valuable we are to them.  Perhaps if we dress up like Nascar drivers they would let us in with open arms?"
542260,Roy,2011-01-22 13:21:00,13728, Perhaps. But even dressed a la Nascar you still couldn't drive very fast on Simcoe. You would however be allowed to turn right.
542262,crappieperchhunter,2011-01-22 13:26:00,2582,"OK I'll play the devils advocate.  Saw this happen years ago in Keswick. Witnessed a women change her kids diaper and throw the dirty diaper on a residence lawn and then walk past a porta pottie and 2 garbage cans to get back to fishing. I think that kinda stuff just pushed the locals over the edge...and can you blame them?  And don't kid yourselves what us anglers spend while there fishing is nothing compared to what the residences pay in taxes just to live there...not to mention they spend most of there hard earned money there EVERYDAY. So IMHO the local politicians are doing what is best for them and there constituents...which obviously  doesn't work out to well for us out of towners.  I don't think complaining at the local level will have any impact at all. Federal maybe your only hope...but with the way infrastructure is already in place...I won't be holding my breathe for that to work either  Myself I just move onto more friendly waters where I am welcome and there are 1,000's and 1,000's of such places still available. This feeling of entitlement because well "" We have always been able to fish there"" I'm afraid is slowly going the way of the Dodo bird.  Not trying to start a pissing match...I just see the other side... and have a less entitled attitude then most."
542301,Vanselena,2011-01-22 16:33:00,269," I have to agree with this post. I used to fish Simcoe heavily and would pick up garbage left by other anglers. Another point is rude anglers unloading their sleds and ATV's in front of peoples houses instead of at the lake at 5:00am. If I was living there then I would be calling the city also.  If we want to keep what access is left, we must make an effort to start informing other anglers to be more thoughtful in their approach."
542305,Sinker,2011-01-22 16:45:00,8692,"IF the residents are complaining about noise from anglers, maybe they shouldn't be living on a LAKE!! What did they think, there would be nobody fishing in it?? Friggen whiners.......  Doesn't hurt my feelings though, on the east side of the lake, access is free!! And there is lots of them. Its the city rif raf that travels to the west side of the lake that wrecks it for everyone else. SLOBS!!  S."
542307,BUSTER,2011-01-22 16:49:00,1336,"If you live by the lake, with public access, your aware of that before you bought your house, if you live by the airport you expect airplanes,you live by the golf course you can expect a few balls in your yard, you live by the school yard you can expect children playing, you live beside the park you can expect people..If you want your little house on the lake with no noise, move up north. We have the right to access public water for recreation use. Period. go to sudbury in the summer to go swimming its free, take the family to the beach in guelph its 5 bucks each....slowly the'll take it all away,slowly..."
542308,Grimace,2011-01-22 16:55:00,2020,"Now that the out of towners and city folk are barred from the access, I think you will find that the garbage and noise problems will not magically go away.  Lets face it, some of the ""locals"" that drive 10 or 15 minutes are no more well behaved than people from 30 minutes or an hour away."
542330,BillM,2011-01-22 18:13:00,17367," Uh, us 'locals' that drive 10-15mins to get there aren't allowed either.  I live in Barrie and can't even apply for a permit to park at BBP.  You should replace 'locals' with 'Innisfil Township Residents' because it makes a bit more sense."
542335,Grimace,2011-01-22 18:23:00,2020,"  Yep.  My point was that the noise and garbage is not the issue because when someone launches a sled or atv, the address on their license does not make it the machine silent.  When some slob throws his garbage in the parking lot, where he resides has nothing to do with the repulsiveness of the action.  By your comment I have the feeling that if Barrie people were allowed in than you would be fine with it.  Your complaint seems to be that you feel like you are a local and are not being included.  I would assert that it is (was) a public access and we should all have the opportunity."
542340,BillM,2011-01-22 18:35:00,17367," I guess you took my comment the wrong way.  My point was that most of the day to day traffic you see on that lake is from the surrounding area, not including Innisfil Beach Township.  I think ANYONE should be able to apply for and purchase a permit to park there, regardless of where you live.  My $100 isn't any better then joe blows $100 regardless of what township he's from."
542346,Grimace,2011-01-22 18:41:00,2020,  I hear ya man.  We are in agreement.

542359,glen,2011-01-22 19:01:00,2641,This comes up every year.  Pretty soon you will have to parachute in to fish.  What can we do to change it?
542362,Billy Bob,2011-01-22 19:16:00,5865,Years ago when I was a kid I was fishing the shoreline on Lake Erie...bothering NO ONE...the property owner said that this is private property and I had to leave which I did...then a few years later a BIG storm came up and did property damage there and the same people now wanted federal/state money to help them.....SCREW them I thought...
542365,Skud,2011-01-22 19:25:00,739, Sounds like a new sport in the making. better trademark it fast.
542369,OhioFisherman,2011-01-22 19:35:00,6623,"Just another way of looking at it and I don`t live there so I have no idea how your systems works. If the residents of the town paid their tax dollars to buy and maintain the park? shouldn`t a fee for out of town people be in order? or just allow them to freeload at the expense of the people that live there?  I didn`t have a problem with paying a reasonable fee at a camp up north for docking my own boat when I went up there, I understood that the camp owner had to maintain the docks if I was using his boats or mine. If I didn`t dock a boat I wouldn`t have had to pay.  Your using their launching ramp, their parking, for a vehicle and a boat trailer? or sled trailer? shouldn`t a fee be in order?  I have to get a chuckle at people that spend all kinds of money on ""their"" own equipment, but find it unreasonable when the residents of a city or town enact a fee for non residents to use ""their"" facilities.  I don`t recall ever hearing of any one complaining about non resident anglers fees?"
542381,Grimace,2011-01-22 20:06:00,2020,That is not the issue.  We pay launch fees and all that everywhere we go without complaint.  The issue is that they are denying us access outright.  Not allowed to access the lake.

Apparently the Township of Innisfil has closed parking in the only lot with access to Big Bay Point unless you are a local. Another access point taken away from the everyday angler if this is true. If you want to go out with the new hut operator at BBP you should be fine.  As someone who walks miles out to a spot, this was a good spot for me to park and hit deep water without walking a marathon. Does anyone know if this information on restricting access to parking at BBP is correct or a hoax? I will find out tomorrow if I can park at BBP, I'm keeping my fingers crossed!  "

My guess is it's the township trying to put some extra $$$ in the coffers please the locals. So if it's a pay per permit system just buy one and thumb your nose at the locals when you park there."
542179,Aaron Shirley,2011-01-22 03:02:00,655," That is outrageous Terry. What access point on Lake Simcoe will be next? Where will it end? If this keeps up, the OMNR will be laying off the CO's that enforce Simcoe, because the only people that will be left fishing will be locals and people renting huts  The town of Innifil has enjoyed the economic benefits from anglers for years, and this is a big slap in the face. Talk about biting the hands that feed them!  I will not be spending any of my money in the township of Innisfil anymore, and I know a lot of other people that will not either over this. I will be making it a point to even fill up my gas at home from now on. I will be contacting the township of Innisfil to let them know this as well. I encourage anyone else that enjoys fishing on Lake Simcoe to do the same. If the township thinks they will lose revenues with a lot of backlash, they may make parking available at Big Bay Point.  Fishing in Ontario and our rights seem to be slowly eroding. This is very sad. One day I may have to explain to my son why we have to travel to New York State to go fishing    Fishing in Ontario seems to be heading in a very bad direction, privitization!"

My buddy wants me to go fishing at his cottage so I will have to purchase a 3 day zone 11.  Now I just need to get a few walleye tags.  Maybe a Laker tag just in case.  Hope I catch some because the tags expire after a week.   UGH!!!!
542206,irishfield,2011-01-22 04:04:00,26272,Be like fishin New Brunswick ..
542208,HTHM,2011-01-22 04:13:00,4082,"Go there, get a ticket and fight it in court. There has to be a charter violation in that bylaw somewhere."
542210,irishfield,2011-01-22 04:18:00,26272,"Be towed and walk home.. no fun in that. Same deal parking toooo close to the ramp at IBPark.  Unfortunately these bylaws get pushed for reasons, whether real or envisioned. It's the way of the ""world"" lately. I have a local, respected councilor (my son! lol) looking into launch fees collected vs salary paid to collect same at the Penetang boat launch!"
542214,Aaron Shirley,2011-01-22 04:36:00,655,"I am very dissapointed with the township of Innisfil about this. I fish there a lot and used to park there. I used to spend money locally there whenever I could, and this is just such a slap in the face  I just wrote the Township of Innisfil on their on-line form.  Here is the link to the township of Innisfil to let them know how you feel about losing access to a prime Lake Simcoe ice fishing spot. We need to flood them with comments people!!! Don't just sit back and let this stuff happen without a fight! They need to have a lot of backlash on this to consider making changes.  http://www.innisfil.ca/contact-us  This is a copy of what I sent the township of Innisfil:  To whom it may concern;  I am an avid angler that has enjoyed spending a lot of time fishing on Lake Simcoe during every season, including ice fishing in the winter. I have spent a considerable amount of my hard-earned money over the years in the township of Innisfil. Accomodations, fuel, bait, tackle and food are some of the examples. One of my favourite spots to go ice fishing in the winter is Kempenfelt Bay and Big Bay Point.  It has been recently brought to my attention that the small parking lot at Big Bay Point to access Kempenfelt Bay and Big Bay Point has been closed to everyone but local residents. As an angler that has spent a lot of money in Innisfil over the years, I find this to be a huge slap in the face. This is completely unacceptable. You are biting the hands that feed you, and your recent decision to close the Big Bay Point parking lot to anglers will be met with major backlash in the angling community.  I will personally make it a point to not spend any more of my hard-earned money in the township of Innisfil until suitable parking for anglers is established at the Big Bay Point area. Furthermore, many people I know will be doing the same. And if this doesn't raise your eyebrows, we will be asking every angler we know and meet to also avoid spending money in the township of Innisfil until suitable parking for anglers is established at Big Bay Point as well.  Please do not respond with ""oh but there is a parking lot over 'there' on the lake. If you would like to keep enjoying the economic benefits that anglers bring to the township of Innisfil, you must establish suitable parking for anglers at the Big Bay Point area. Period.  Sincerely,"
542215,toca,2011-01-22 04:40:00,274,anyone here know who can print fake parking permits for innisfil?
542216,irishfield,2011-01-22 04:45:00,26272,LOL... scan and print..  Funny thing.. Midland Ramp.. the 2007 I made someone from my old 2006 that I had looked better than the 2007 I got from the town (they'd sent their excess 2006 back to the maker to be updated!)
542221,HTHM,2011-01-22 05:20:00,4082,Make that 2 Perhaps a flood of emails regarding this issue might help them shake thier heads out of stupid.
542222,Grimace,2011-01-22 05:25:00,2020,Problem with this type of thing is that you can send them letters but the municiple governments are after municiple votes.  The local guys love this.  They will vote them back in.  Where are all the Innisfil guys on this board even.  They love it.  Gets us out of their hair.
542225,BillM,2011-01-22 05:40:00,17367,"Blame the Scuba Divers, this is the reason that the park is now closed to public parking.  http://www.simcoe.com/news/cityhall/article/848663--town-will-regulate-scuba-divers"
542226,bigugli,2011-01-22 05:48:00,6138,Added my voice.  Does this mean the Tyler event is going to a different locale?
542227,irishfield,2011-01-22 05:51:00,26272,"That isn't the ""Tyler"" local Bruce!"
542228,bigugli,2011-01-22 06:10:00,6138,Was just wondering if any Innisfil site is going to be available. I can see other municipal lots as being fair game.
542230,irishfield,2011-01-22 06:14:00,26272,Innisfil beach.. as of last year .. 10 dollars upon entrance to park. Waved during fishing for Tyler last year...
542240,misfish,2011-01-22 10:26:00,29133,"Im think,n a drive out there after work today and maybe see if I can park in a locals driveway.Politly offer them a cash donation.It cant hurt.   Thats not to take away from what you are saying Aaron.I totally agree with you.Just dont blame the divers here.Alot has to do with noice aswell.Sleds and atvs firing up in the early hours of the morning.Im sure that is part of it aswell."
