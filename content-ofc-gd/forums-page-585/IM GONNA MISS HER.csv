542813,Big Cliff,2011-01-23 19:05:00,6899,"Last time I told Sue I was going fishing and I didn't care if she liked it or not, she told me if I did, I wouldn't see her for three days.  She was right, by day four the swelling in my eyes had started to go down and I could make out shapes again!"
542814,splashhopper,2011-01-23 19:10:00,2931,  Did she tell u it was only four days.... i am pretty sure she posted here a while back saying that Cliff would be missing for about a week since she had just whacked u with a 2x4 a little harder than anticipated
542816,Roy,2011-01-23 19:15:00,13728," The name of the tune you're looking for is ""Sharp dressed man"" and no, that's not one of the tunes."

542328,spincast,2011-01-22 18:04:00,3279,and here was me thinking you had decided to keep the boat and the cigarettes when I looked at the subject
542360,mercman,2011-01-22 19:04:00,7054,"  got 7 packs left, and then all hells gonna break loose"
542366,Billy Bob,2011-01-22 19:25:00,5865,"Ya, who would thunk.......I have been threated to have my offical USA Redneck card pulled....

542380,Squid,2011-01-22 19:57:00,1656,Awesome songs guys!!! Some of my favs!!
542387,Leecher,2011-01-22 20:30:00,7832,Sorry Paul but country music is for when I go in the bush.... and I do appreciate it but for me this is what I truly enjoy  Disturbed  Leechman
542397,Roy,2011-01-22 20:45:00,13728,"""Disturbed"" is the correct name for that, Jacques.  Sorry, you're certainly entitled to your choices in music but I can't listen to head bangers for more than 3 seconds. If we hit the water this summer, I choose the traveling music, ok?"
542402,Leecher,2011-01-22 20:55:00,7832, OK Roy you're right and certainly entitled to it    I'm all for traveling music   I'm cool with that  Let's make it happen this summer Jacques
542669,Spiel,2011-01-23 12:51:00,9065,"  LOL....and I can't listen to anything Country for more than 2 secs, vile stuff. If we share a boat Roy we'll leave the tunes on shore."
542670,Roy,2011-01-23 12:54:00,13728," No worries Chris, I'll meet ya halfway with ZZ TOP."
542671,Spiel,2011-01-23 12:57:00,9065, Atta Boy. We'll likely just give our boat keys to someone else and we can share beer(s) instead of music.
542672,muskymatt,2011-01-23 12:58:00,2608,"Going back to the original thread   ...Brad's ""I'm gonna miss her"" is a classic fishing tune.....one for the ages. He should have had the blonde being ejected off the boat in that video"
