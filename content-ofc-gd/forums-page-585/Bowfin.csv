Does anyone know if they are related to the dreaded ""northern snakehead"" that everyone is worrying about invading ontario waters from asia?  "

We have a section of the river were they are established and the forecast of doom and gloom has not appeared in 8 years since they were introduced  accidentally.   Art

541775,fishing n autograph,2011-01-21 02:57:00,2540,Okay...what's the difference between a ling bowfin and burbot?
541783,John Bacon,2011-01-21 03:26:00,3277, Ling and burbot refer to a deep water mostly nocturnal fish that if often found in the vicinity of lake trout.  Bowfin is a shallow water fish that is active in the day and is found in the same habitat as large mouth and pike.  They have a similar shape but different colouration.  Ling aka Burbot are reputed to taste like lobster while bowfin are reputed to be very poor table fair.
541792,OhioFisherman,2011-01-21 03:48:00,6623,"Actually the biggest bowfin I ever saw, pushing 20 pounds was caught by my buddy on the Georgian Bay in about 20 feet of water."
