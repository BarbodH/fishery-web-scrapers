541827,perchslayer666,2011-01-21 11:37:00,280," Seems like you have a hard-on for the Patriarch, why don't you just BUY it. As mentioned that reel being fairly new, not many people have had a chance to give it a go other than in a store....  Do you want us to buy it for you as well????"
541832,Gregoire,2011-01-21 11:58:00,1397," Easy there Chachi. For me this is a big investment and I am trying to get as much info about the reels that I am considering. By all means if you are offering to buy this reel for me go ahead, otherwise I would appreciate positive comments."
541858,perchslayer666,2011-01-21 13:43:00,280," Ha ha lol, call me crazy, but a $150-$200 reel is mid level in my opinion, you want high end, buy a Stella, Sustain or a Steez...  For the 2 reels you are looking at, given all the reply's on this post, take a shot and pick one. Indecisiveness is the downfall of mankind."
541877,Gregoire,2011-01-21 14:26:00,1397, I wish I could be in your position. My plan is to get the two reels in my hand and find which one I prefer. By the way IMO women are the downfall on makind...just saying
541884,perchslayer666,2011-01-21 14:46:00,280," Lol, well we can both agree on that. I still think the Microline CI4 is the sweetest UL spinning on the market for the price Good luck with the search dude...."
541910,doubleheader,2011-01-21 15:30:00,497,"Funny, I've been going through the same internal debate about the Patriarch. Last nite on Cabelas I even put it in my basket before deciding to hold off. About 10 years back, after expermenting with many brands i said enough is enough and made Shimano my standard. Between Stradics,Symetres, abd Sahara's I have close to a dozen, but I really haven't been overwelmed with Shimano spinning reel quality the last couple of years. The thing that has attracted my interest in the Patriarch is the max drag on the 35 model of 16 lbs, yet the weight is still excellent, plus their reels have an excellent reputation. Trust me when you have a joint disease, I have psoriatic arthritis, a couple oz's makes a difference, especially in your wrists. I did notice a mail-in rebate from Pfleuger, something like $15, on the Cabelas site, but being somewhat cheap I thought I'd hold off until the next sale or coupon offer."
541930,troutologist,2011-01-21 16:13:00,951,"Has anyone had problems with their stradics? Mine have all been bullet proof for years now, from portage trips to submersions in winter steelhead river, and many days on the water. Haven't found a better reel for a reasonable price.  Have a pfluger president and hate it, anti reverse fails all the time while icefishing.  Though I prefer the FIs and older models, the CI4 has stood up very well for the time I've had it and I was pretty skeptical about its durability."
542736,lookinforwalleye,2011-01-23 16:01:00,4399,Maybe it`s just me but for the life of me I can`t understand why anyone would need a 150.00-200.00 reel for icefishing!
542785,aplumma,2011-01-23 18:15:00,6896," Sometimes it not a need... just a want. We all have a cost limit and it is different for each item as it fits into our life. I would not give you a quarter for the best cup of coffee but will pay 1.75 for a Pepsi with no issues. Ice fishing has little value to me because it is a cold weather sport but I will spend over $1,000.oo to fish in Canada when it is warm. Go figure Eh?   Art"
542810,MCTFisher9120,2011-01-23 18:55:00,3761,"I would say go for the Stradic, pretty sure I'm replacing my Symetre with a Stradic...maybe even a Sustain"
542861,lookinforwalleye,2011-01-23 21:00:00,4399," I hear ya Art, I just got off a cruise ship and was paying 2 bucks for a coke and 4 bucks for a cappuccino and I bought two more nice watches duty free,didn`t need anymore watches I just like watches."
542877,aplumma,2011-01-23 21:50:00,6896,I hear yaa I am guilty of buying knifes and tools. I love a good working knife and spent $225.00 on a sharpening system called the Wicked Edge. I even thought I was nuts for that purchase until I sharpened my first knife with it. Man O Man it can raise an edge that will cut you just looking at it. After hitting it with the 1200 diamond hone looking thru a magnify glass it is smooth as glass.   Art
541569,Gregoire,2011-01-20 18:10:00,1397,"Hello all, I have decided that I am going to purchase a higher end spinnig reel. I will be pairing this reel with a high quality ice fishing rod for the hardwater (hopefulley lakers and Whitefish) and a finess rod on the softwater (Weightless applications and river fishing).  I have been considering the following models and would like people's input and experiences regarding the following reels:  Shimano: Stradic F11000 Stradic CI4F1000 The reason why I am considerign the CI4 is because it is so light. I am wondering if anyone has tried both these reels. If the CI4 worth the extra money? Also wondering what the difference is between the CI4 and the microline version.  I would also consider the Sustain, but am not sure that it is worth the price. I also am looking to get a newly designed reel, if I am going to spend nearly $200 I want it to have new technology in it. I just get the impression that the F1 and the Sustain, although great reels, are using some older technology. I also do not like the fact that the CI4 does not come with a spare spool.  Abu GarciaSoron STX10 This reel is a bit heavier but seems to be reliable and well built.  Quantum Energy PTI-B From what I hear this is a great reel. The model is a bit old and the reel is a bit heavy.  Pflueger Patriarch 9525x By far the lightest reel that I am considering (5.6 oz compared to 6.1 for the CI4) I am just worried about how reliable this reel would be. I have not been able to find a great deal of info online about this reel.  I am really looking for your experiences with these reels. I am willing to spend up to $250.  As of right now I am leaning towards the CI4 or the Patriarch, due to how little they weigh, but I do not want to buy a reel becuase it is light and find out that it is not as good as a heavier reel.  I really appreciate any information that you can provide.  Greg"
541571,perchslayer666,2011-01-20 18:14:00,280,"Sheeeemano bro... Micro line CI4 - That would be my pic - light but strong, and has a super smooth retrive and drag."
541574,Gregoire,2011-01-20 18:19:00,1397,Really interested if anyone can compare the Patriarch to the CI4. Also any input on Hardwater us would be great.
541575,timmeh,2011-01-20 18:25:00,609,"I have a stradic3000 that i've fished hard over the past 2 years. It's been submerged many times, dropped a couple of times and still works flawlessly. I just clean it up and oil it now and then.  I agree with buying quality gear once as opposed to lower end stuff many times but I can't see how the C14 is really any better than a regular stradic. Ya there's a weight difference but can't imagine and extra once or 2 really makes a difference. If it does, time for some pushups. And it looks a little fancier. But personally I think it's purely a marketing thing to make us spend more money.  Also I don't like the small handles on the C14 vs the regular stradic. That maybe be biased though as I fish in colder weather and when wearing gloves the larger handles are easier to grab. But that may not apply to you."
541576,s2k4mee,2011-01-20 18:26:00,73,"The Patriarch just came out a couple months ago, so you won't find many people on here with first hand experience.  However, I am sure there are a couple of reviews online that may help."
541581,Roy,2011-01-20 18:58:00,13728,"I love my Stradics but I would recommend you buy the Saros. Really, after the $120- $140. price point, there's not enough difference in the reels to justify their purchase. And really, how delicate are we that we need to be concerned about a reel weighing an ounce more or less than another? But that's just my opinion."
541584,asdve23rveavwa,2011-01-20 19:09:00,2690, Words of wisdom.  I totally agree...anything over $150 for a spinning reel is serious overkill...but that's just my opinion.
541585,Lunker777,2011-01-20 19:10:00,866,I bought a Saros to try out over my Saharas..... sold both my saharas and picked up another Saros.... Very nice reel for the money !
541587,PainInTheBass,2011-01-20 19:18:00,102,"An ounce or two is not a large number on its own.  But as a percentage of the total weight of a combo, it can be huge.  When you are down to a 10 oz combo, 2 oz is 20%.  Beyond that, it can change the way a combo balances and feels.  To some, this is not important, to others it is.  There is a huge market for the ultra lightweight reels, and I don't think it is because the people who are spending big bucks on these reels are simply buying into marketing.  Some put a high value on the total weight of a combo for whatever reason.  It could be vanity, but if the price of their vanity is justified to them, then the difference in price is worth it.  I can comment on the quality of Pflueger reels in that the president has a good reputation of longevity and performance.  I have used a stradic F1, and I did not like them for any true performance reasons (I am a Daiwa guy).  I have not used the Cl4 to be able to comment on the differences aside from weight; however, I have read reviews for which the only real negative is the lack of a spare spool.  I am not sure if this is the case with the Stradic F1.  I am not a fan of the Quantum spinning reels as the the constructino on the models I have played with did not feel very good to me.  The Abu's I have played with all felt solid and smooth.  Of the one's you listed, I would personally select the Patriarch followed by the CI4.  Disclaimer: I put value on weight as well as on bling.  I am young and vain."
541588,Bernie66,2011-01-20 19:20:00,123,"What about Daiwa?  They make some nice reels in that price range.  Weight isn't every, just make sure it balances nicely with your rod.  Don't know about the Pflueger but a couple of friends that bought the CI4 were not very happy with it, especially during cold weather.  If you can wait till the Basspro sale, they had some nice JDM Daiwa reels on sale lastyear. I am hoping they will have some more out this year."
541593,zeeter,2011-01-20 19:33:00,92,"I only buy Stradics now.  They are the best reel for the money.  Super smooth, light and they cast great.  You won't be disappointed."
541597,Terry,2011-01-20 19:56:00,14456,I have the Stradic CI4F1000 and really love it I got it because I wanted the lightest one in a 1000 reel  I bought it on line in the US for 2/3 of the cost in canada
541602,Guest gbfisher,2011-01-20 20:06:00,0,Nothing beats a good stick for hard water fishing. Cheap too! The way I see it the more it costs the faster you're going to break it. Breaking a stick doesn't cost a thing except the time it took you to make it.
541604,Gregoire,2011-01-20 20:09:00,1397, What retailer did you use?
541605,scugpg,2011-01-20 20:14:00,1373,I've played with the Pfluger Patriarch a few times in the shop and I find it a better reel than the Stradic Ci4. Feels smoother and its a quieter reel.  The handle is also a bit longer than the Ci4's so give them both a shot.  I'm a big fan of the Stradic MGFB's if you can find them anymore. I'd rather one of those over a Ci4 any day. Not much heavier either.
541613,Whitemikeca,2011-01-20 20:30:00,138," They had japanese domestic model daiwas at basspro?  I would agree that the OP should consider Daiwas.  The Fuego spinning reel is a really nice reel and cost and weight should be similar to the CI4   X2 - The CI4 is are really great reel IMO.  There are some really good deals on Ebay for Shimanos.  I have bought 5 shimanos on ebay in the past 2 years and have probably saved around $800 over MRSP.  I would suggest the OP to take a look at ""reelsmarttackle"" on ebay.  I have never tried the Patriarch brand so I cannot comment from experience but I have seen some online posts and reviews and it seems like a lot of people like these reels.  Personally I would stick with a shimano."
541643,Terry,2011-01-20 21:11:00,14456, bought it on ebay..new in package
541665,uglyfish,2011-01-20 22:15:00,981,"the quantum energy PTI-B is one of the best reels u can get. they look great, they are compact, and light. very smooth, great drag on them and come in many sizes including a new size 05. i personally dont like shimano, althought they do make some quality gear. but, when u sk a question like this, ur gonna get bias opinions only. cause each person is gonna tell u to buy the brand they like best. go to a store and try each reel out, put each on the rod u wanna get and see how they all feel. pick the one that feels best for u.  u really cant go all that wrong on any of those reels. they are all great reels."

541704,trapshooter,2011-01-20 23:37:00,1234,I a big shimano fan.  I have a couple 1000 size stradics that do double duty on the ice and summer too.  I put a lot of miles on those reels year in and year out and they take it well.
541741,Gregoire,2011-01-21 01:17:00,1397,"Has anyone on tried the Pflueger Patriarch? I am seriously considering this reel, but would like to hear some feedback on it. There seems to be very little information online about it, I can't seem to find a decent review of the reel."
541743,2advanced,2011-01-21 01:21:00,53,I own most of the shimano line up from the Sahara to Stella - for simple ice fishing the stratic model is definately enough to handle most of your fishing applications.  Although  picking up the patriarch and trying it at the store it is fairly smooth and light for the price... But I'm bias lol I like my shimano gear
541751,2advanced,2011-01-21 01:44:00,53,But yes shimano not having spare spools anymore for ANY model blows chunks
541812,Gregoire,2011-01-21 04:58:00,1397,"Anyone else? I am still leaning towards the patriarch. I'll definitely post with my thoughts on the reel, whatever one I end up with."
