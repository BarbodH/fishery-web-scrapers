542640,Gregoire,2011-01-23 04:47:00,1397,Aren't Whitehorse and Yellowknife both in Canadialand? What happens to your igloos when the temperature is above freezing?
542661,blue pickeral,2011-01-23 10:07:00,267,Whitehorse and parts of Yukon are occasionally subject to warm air blowing in off the Pacific Ocean. Makes for nice temps in the winter.  Yellowknife is in the Arctic weather pattern...if I remember correctly dictated by weather over Siberia..
542666,mbac31,2011-01-23 12:37:00,904,  They get a nice glossy Sheen to them which gives you a few extra seconds when it freezes again to go through the escape hatch before the Polar Bears take the roof down.
