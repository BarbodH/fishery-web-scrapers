The Pit Party                1500HP Jet Quad    The seats were not as close as last year but we had a great view            Robosaurus              Ended with 2 Gravediggers coming out for freestyle    I got some video I will be uploading later  Good seeing ya SRT, hope your drive was alright"
542782,aplumma,2011-01-23 18:10:00,6896,I love the trucks and the mechanical part but the one I went to in an indoor arena darn near made me deaf for 2 days. I will never go back without ear plugs and earphones.   Art
542791,mercman,2011-01-23 18:30:00,7054,awesome !!!!love Robosaurus
542797,splashhopper,2011-01-23 18:41:00,2931,very kewl.... I wonder how they transport those beast between shows? Maybe take the wheels off and lift them on to flat beds that get winched in to the trailers? Does anyone know
542804,livinisfishin,2011-01-23 18:52:00,661,Some sweet rides and some sweet shots! Its been a long time since I've gone to a show like that!
542834,Leecher,2011-01-23 19:49:00,7832,Never been to an event of this magnitude before Dan but looks like you guys had red hot action from start to finish Thanks for sharing the pics!!! Leechman
542895,SRT8 smoker craft,2011-01-23 22:41:00,1107,Yeah it was a great show my boy loved it. Our drive home wasn't bad Dan saw a guy roll his chevy pick up in the hammer. It was good seeing you and your little dude he was really excited like mine. Splash they put smaller tires on them and drive them into transport trucks. Were going to the supercross in march to my boy and me love anything with motors that go fast.
542931,danbouck,2011-01-24 01:01:00,4380,yep small tires and load em up    
543243,Aaron Shirley,2011-01-24 23:51:00,655,"Very cool. Those things are amazingly huge! I really wanted to take my 2 year old son to this, despite his fav Blue Thunder not being there, but wifey said no. He's too young and he'll keep taking off the ear muffs or plugs, she's prob right.  He also likes Taz, Grave Digger, Maximum Destruction, Stone Crusher and Destroyer lol. He's been into monster trucks for almost a year now. Most kids take a teady bear to bed, he has to take Blue Thunder and Taz, or Doc Hudson lol.  Hopefully I can take him next year. At least I got Monster Jam for the PS3 for Xmas. He has a hard time controlling the trucks, but loves watching me for a bit then trying.  Thanks for the photos, they are pretty neat."
543244,danbouck,2011-01-24 23:55:00,4380," I have found that once it starts going they completely forget about them. There is another show in London in February, you still have time to talk her into it"
543264,SRT8 smoker craft,2011-01-25 00:35:00,1107,"Yep my 2 year old didn't want to wear his hearing protection either but once they got going he leht them alone and loved every second of it next year we should get a group of OFNers to go you can book sections of seats for groups 15 or larger I,m sure we could get more than 15 to go it's a awesome show Aaron your boy would love it.      "
543414,JohnF,2011-01-25 14:02:00,3494,I've only watched 'em a few times on tv. I can't figure out how they don't just explode when they land after some of that big air they get. They look so flimsy.  JF
