542277,fishnsled,2011-01-22 15:11:00,3520,Nice going! Good looking whities.
542514,walleyemaster,2011-01-23 01:05:00,325,"ok ..was out today and found them again between 82-85 feet of water. left my camera phone back at the house. i was north west of the fox shoal on the big water, there is lots of ice on the big lake, i found 6 inches and mostly 10 inches. also starting to see people setting up their huts out on the big lake. again i looked for them for a couple of hours and then i found them and caught limit in 10 min.. so for those of you who had trouble getting them this year, get out there and get em.. have fun and be safe"
542523,misfish,2011-01-23 01:21:00,29133,"Good job on finding them,again. Out in the AM. Hope to get one atleast."
542528,Grimace,2011-01-23 01:27:00,2020,Thanks for report man.  Well done.  My ice fishing season starts next Saturday.
542609,Leecher,2011-01-23 03:43:00,7832, Got to love being able to limit out on them in 10 min Great job walleyemaster
542625,NAW,2011-01-23 04:07:00,4022, You see anyone out at Long Shoal?  Plan on heading out next weekend.  I would imagine the ice will be plenty for by then.
542638,siwash,2011-01-23 04:42:00,683,  Very kind of you to narrow it down for us. I don't have a sled and I think that would be a VERY long walk!! I am hoping to find accessible areas to walk out to but it seems like lots of parking issues..
542644,irishfield,2011-01-23 05:05:00,26272,Park at Innisfil Beach.. $10.. and it's not much of a walk to get to deep water.
542655,siwash,2011-01-23 06:02:00,683, Thank you!!
542656,siwash,2011-01-23 06:03:00,683,So I am assuming ice is safe at Innisfil Park?
543595,walleyemaster,2011-01-26 00:49:00,325,"will be out again in the morning smashing the whities, same spot should produce.. if anyone is out tomorrow i will see you there bright and early..."
543604,Terry,2011-01-26 01:18:00,14456," dang I need to retire  or find a job that I only have to show up one day a week....LOL       no, really"

542075,walleyemaster,2011-01-21 23:00:00,325,Hi guys took the day off yesterday and went out on simcoe... found the whities finally. took about 2hours to find them and about 10 min to catch them. was using the williams and was in 85 feet of water    
542077,Terry,2011-01-21 23:02:00,14456,nice going  I have not found any whities yet
542079,Roy,2011-01-21 23:05:00,13728,Congrats to you! You did well. Those ought to put a good lump in your belly!
542080,keiths,2011-01-21 23:06:00,30,"How was the ice? Also, what side of the Lake did you fish. Thanks for any info."
542083,douG,2011-01-21 23:08:00,2693,"Just pm Emil / aka icefisherman.  He scored whitefish on Simcoe regularly for at least a decade, with no signs of letting up.  Go fishing?  Catch fish.  No big deal, but do it every time."
542084,Roy,2011-01-21 23:11:00,13728, It was obviously the right side.
542087,walleyemaster,2011-01-21 23:14:00,325," hi doug, i know where they are but this year people are having a hard time do to slow ice conditions. very few have ventured into deep waters. i have spots gps ed on  this lake for the last 10 years but have only produced perch so far, but yesterday i found them and i will be back in the morning.."
542090,douG,2011-01-21 23:26:00,2693,"Perseverance always pays off in the end.  On the other hand, the problem with delayed gratification is all the waiting."
542092,walleyemaster,2011-01-21 23:30:00,325," very well put, i guess that's why we are all still fishing"
542094,Roy,2011-01-21 23:30:00,13728,The problem with instant gratification is no anticipation.
542105,misfish,2011-01-21 23:45:00,29133,I seen you.Watch out for the guy in the white suit.  Nice catch and feed there bye.

542154,irishfield,2011-01-22 02:25:00,26272, Just keep an eye out for his Box Hun !
542162,icefisherman,2011-01-22 02:30:00,952,"Good job walleyemaster! That is how it normally works...limit under 10 min...or searching for them all day I may try them myself on Sunday, in the big chill ha ha ha... I've got bunch of local buddies going daily and all are having difficulties zeroing on them so far this yer...so you are definitely ahead of the pack PM me if you out on Sunday...or next week...maybe we can hook up and compare notes ha ha ha.  Cheers, Ice FIsherman"
542191,Aaron Shirley,2011-01-22 03:31:00,655,Very nice whities! I'm hoping to find a few myself tomorrow. Good job.
542219,beginner,2011-01-22 05:04:00,542,good looking whitie.. I'm still trying to find them..
542256,Billy Bob,2011-01-22 12:39:00,5865,I get a woody every time I see whitefish.....by FAR the BEST smoked fish in the world....wish I could get them down here....  Keep posting pics of whitefish....  Bob
542269,spinnerdoc,2011-01-22 14:46:00,556,"i agree, great tasting fish...i've had them smoked and had them just plain old bbq with salt and peppper...yummmm."
542271,Billy Bob,2011-01-22 14:49:00,5865," I soak my fish in a salt and brown sugar brine overnight and then use maple wood to smoke them...put in fridge to cool, usually overnight and then take the fish to the fire hall and watch the wolves go crazy...oh, a few cold Canadian Beers of course...."
542274,limeyangler,2011-01-22 15:06:00,5204, Me Toooooooooo!   Nice fish WM.
