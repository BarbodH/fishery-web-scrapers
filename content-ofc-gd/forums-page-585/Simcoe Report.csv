542966,Pikeslayer,2011-01-24 02:10:00,1443,"I had the pleasure to visit Le Chateau Skeeter en Lefroy this weekend. Unfortunately, when i arrived Skeeter told me that he was overbooked but he did have a couple of guests checking out early and i was more than welcome to hang around outside his hut. Y'all know how brutally cold it was but Skeeter was kind enough to allow me to come into his hut for a minute whenever somebody inside had to pee (I really wished that they had to pee more but I found out later that they were wearing depends). He even gave me a half a cup of warm coffee that he didn't want anymore. I think that saved my life. There were hundreds of huts out there but Skeeter said that they were reserved for 'guides' or higher and that because I was just 'almost a guide', I would need to make more posts on line. Thankfully, a couple of Skeeter's friends left at 1:30 and his son Daniel told me there was room for me now but I had to surrender all my food and Canadian Tire money if I wanted to come inside. I happily handed over 4 lbs of back bacon and $1.15 in cold (really cold) CT cash. I was so grateful that I threw in a some fresh bread as I was so happy to finally be fishing. Well I was finally able to hold a rod by about 2:30 and the fishing was fast & furious until 3:00. I lost count of how many fish we caught because I don't think my brain was functioning very well (it was really cold outside). Daniel liked the back bacon so much, that he told me I could come back this morning as long I brought him hot chocolate and a double dip chocolate donut. I was happy to oblige but I had to rob a convenience store because Tim's doesn't take AMEX. It was so worth it to spend just to spend an extra few hours with Skeeter & Son. I really, really had a great time. A great big THANK YOU to Skeeter & Daniel.  Pikeslayer"
