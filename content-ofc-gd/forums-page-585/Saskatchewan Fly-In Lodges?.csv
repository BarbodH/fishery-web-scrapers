Also Scott lake lodge, is an unbelievable fisherey, with great facilities, I was just having coffee with a guide there this morning actually. Lots more focused on lake trout here, but there is big pike and grayling as well."

I highly recommend Bellows Lake if you are looking for fantastic walleye fishing. Here's a link.  http://www.google.ca...k7gReK2g28t8ZAg   Another great Saskatchewan lodge, being in business since the fifties, is Arctic Lodge. Can't ever go wrong with fishing on Reindeer Lake.  http://www.google.ca...gajb5FDGz4pQ4ig"

My cousin worked for a number of summers for the founder of the lodge, Fred Lockhart. Fred wrote a book about the establishing the lodge back in the fifities and it's and interesting read if you can find a copy. The title of the book is Deadline June 7th."
