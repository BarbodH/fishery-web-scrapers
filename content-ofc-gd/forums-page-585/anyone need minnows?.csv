542414,GBW,2011-01-22 21:15:00,8460,Hey all.  I still have a doz or more minnows alive and kicking from last weekend fishing.  If you want them come get them and bring a bucket.  I'm not sure when I can get out fishing next so the offer is out there for someone to make use of some free minnows.  Geoff
542844,GBW,2011-01-23 20:04:00,8460,Bump - if anyone is going for the evening/night bite.
542863,BillM,2011-01-23 21:01:00,17367,Put them in the freezer and use them as chum!

542873,aplumma,2011-01-23 21:44:00,6896,fillet them and put on crackers.  Art
542876,Leecher,2011-01-23 21:48:00,7832, Yeah.... add a little pepper
542885,GBW,2011-01-23 22:06:00,8460,they are going to end up salted for bait.  I had hope that someone would use them but I guess not.
542886,Leecher,2011-01-23 22:11:00,7832, I'd ask you to send them to me Geoff but I have a couple of dozens in the freezer
542894,walleyejack,2011-01-23 22:34:00,358,put em on the left over pizza and pretend they are anchovies
543023,Jer,2011-01-24 12:05:00,1426,"I've been keeping minnows in my basement since before Christmas.  Five gallon pail, small aquarium aerator, change out half the water every couple of days and I've lost very few minnows. Never keep more than 2 scoops at a time, add a scoop as required."
543130,highdrifter,2011-01-24 19:27:00,2534,Shame you're not offering them in bulk..  You'd have had more biters!
