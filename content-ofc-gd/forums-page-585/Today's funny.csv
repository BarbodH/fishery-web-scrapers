543650,John Bacon,2011-01-26 02:48:00,3277,"Hospital Regulations  Hospital regulations require a wheelchair for patients being discharged. While working as a student nurse, however, I found one elderly gentleman already dressed and sitting on the bed with his suitcase at his feet, who insisted he didn't need any help to leave the hospital. After a chat about rules being rules, he reluctantly let me wheel him to the elevator. On the way down, I asked him if his wife was meeting him. ""I don't know,"" he said. ""She's still upstairs int he bathroom changing out of her hospital gown."""
