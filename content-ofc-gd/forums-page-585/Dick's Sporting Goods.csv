I was at the 2 Dicks today(1 near Boulevard Mall, and 1 at Galleria Mall in Buffalo)  Both had some great clearance prices on Rapalas and other Cranks (check the Bins/racks marked %50 off)  Rapala Shadraps and fatraps and other assorted cranks $2.50-3.00  Rapala Super Shad Raps $5.00  Mepps Musky Maraboo $5.00"

543220,irishfield,2011-01-24 23:20:00,26272,Thanks for the heads up. Might save a few guys some dollars that are already going across.  Haven't been to the 2 Dicks Dax.. but my brother and I have tipped pints at the ThreeCocks. 
543238,aplumma,2011-01-24 23:42:00,6896,By supporting competition the consumer wins. When you buy a Ford do you only use factory oil filter and oil or do you buy a better priced or better made item? I haven't paid the extra price of the Mercedes boxed parts since I found I could bulk buy the same parts overseas at over 40% savings including shipping.   Art
543262,asdve23rveavwa,2011-01-25 00:31:00,2690," I totally agree.  Much as I love to support the local guys, and Canada in general.  I like to support my ""bottom line"" just as much.  I too have made some purchases online in the last few years, after never having done so.  If I can get the same product for X amount of dollars cheaper, that is where I'm going to buy. Had I been in that store and saw Rapalas for that price, your darn right I'd be snapping up a few."
543268,newboykool,2011-01-25 00:36:00,81,can i order from them online...?
543269,Pigeontroller,2011-01-25 00:36:00,2793,  LMAO!
543271,Pigeontroller,2011-01-25 00:37:00,2793,  So I suppose everything in your House is from Canada???  60% off? I'll buy it from North Korea...
543307,10point,2011-01-25 01:54:00,165,I bought 3 rapalas here in Indiana for less than $8 at Dicks this past weekend.
543312,tschirk,2011-01-25 02:07:00,261,"I've been looking for a new Yamaha Grizzley 550 EPS, The Canadian website is $2,400 more than US (after promos). I want to buy from a Canadian dealer but I refused to be screwed with paying @ 30% premium. Even with duty and tax it should be no more than a 10% premium. We are being gouged. Considering this is discretionary income/spend you would think they would be a little more concerned.... I think I'll just keep my money...."

543396,solopaddler,2011-01-25 11:48:00,8605,These guys have some pretty unreal prices as well:  http://www.overstockbait.com/  Recently bought a whackload of Hotshots for $1.99
543397,Billy Bob,2011-01-25 11:57:00,5865," One time I was shopping for sporting goods online and typed in ""Dicks""....you don't want to go there...  Remember when you purchase in Canada you are contributing to your health care system.  Bob"
543425,blaque,2011-01-25 14:46:00,2419,Did this thread seriously just turn into this.... based on a heads up to grab a few rapalas on sale at a sporting goods store in the states.....Really????
543538,Pigeontroller,2011-01-25 21:36:00,2793,"Yup, next time I won't bother..."
