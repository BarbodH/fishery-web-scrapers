543321,gino,2011-01-25 02:28:00,400,
543322,gino,2011-01-25 02:28:00,400,ha ha ha ...got that ...thanks!
543327,Moosebunk,2011-01-25 02:39:00,3970,Haha... enjoyed that video...  Ashame it'll dirty the lake really...
543331,Rod Caster,2011-01-25 02:47:00,5784,  Neat to watch..but potentially a couple hundred litres of diesel in the lake plus the other fluids... that sucks and they're insurance is going WAY up.
543333,Terry,2011-01-25 02:55:00,14456,first nations  the federal government is most likely on the hook for the bill so you and I are going to pay for it
543335,irishfield,2011-01-25 02:58:00,26272,What insurance? First Nations truck... with a slow moving vehicle sign.. no plates no insurance. They are apparently going to be charged under the environmental act though for every day it's down there and are working on a recovery plan. I've talked to a diver contacted and the logistics are a nightmare. It's in sand/silt.. both plows are down... that will need to be lifted somehow while underwater before it can be winched back to shore for recovery. It's 360 feet from shore...
543342,walleyemaster,2011-01-25 03:15:00,325," hey gino if you want some nice lakers i would suggest fishing just off of bear island north of mels market. if you would like walleye then try the evening fishing by rabbit nose  and if you would like to be close to loon lodge then fish by the broom islands i have caught many lakers there, through all seasons. start at the island there is a shoal and work your way away from the island till you find fish on fish finder then get ready to catch..i like orange sweedish pimples they work well for me in this area..oh and a little meat on the hooks always works well in temagami..hope this helps.."
543454,John the Fisherman,2011-01-25 16:08:00,45,Lets not even go there.
543579,gino,2011-01-26 00:18:00,400," Thanks for the advice...always helps, I'll try your recommendations."
541735,gino,2011-01-21 01:03:00,400,Hi everyone! I want to go on Temagami on february and I was wondering if anyone been there lately. How is fishing there? Any recommendations regarding places to go? How thick is the ice? thank you very much! Gino
541739,chris.brock,2011-01-21 01:11:00,4053,"I'm pretty sure with this brutal cold weather, the ice is at least a foot thick by now"
541778,smally21,2011-01-21 03:15:00,993,tamarvacations.com - check the website and give him a call he'll update you on ice conditions but feb should be no problem
541785,10point,2011-01-21 03:30:00,165,Check out www.ottertooth.com  I think the ice road is open so I would think the ice is good.
541788,irishfield,2011-01-21 03:37:00,26272,"Don't be so sure about that 10 point.. Temagami first nations will clean and then flood to increase thickness and get the ice road open.. just like my neighbour does to get a road out to his place and mine. I'm the one that posted the road to Bear Island was open, on Ottertooth, based on Nipfishers trip up there.  That said... I know I can at least drive a portion of the NE Arm.. but not sure how safe it is beyond the gap onto the main lake... or thru the axe narrows.  Gino.. just remember that Lakers don't open until the 15th of Feb."
541834,fishhunter,2011-01-21 12:03:00,604,NO FISH IN THAT LAKE
541864,John the Fisherman,2011-01-21 13:56:00,45,"Temagami FN will be putting the 5 ton plow on the ice road come Mon.  TFN does not flood the road to increase thickness.  There was 14"" of clear black ice at my hut on Sun. before this cold snap, so I would guess 16"" by now.  As we all know the ice is not consistantly thick, but I would not fear sledding around the main channels.  Saw a full size pickup heading up the NE arm on Sun.  Not sure how far up they may have went, but I would guess up to Broom Island, or the Hub. JTF"
541902,John the Fisherman,2011-01-21 15:18:00,45,5 ton is on the ice road today. JTF
541908,irishfield,2011-01-21 15:30:00,26272,Thanks for the update JTF ! I thought they flooded that thing... but I guess just keeping the snow off is the main thing. I know with our road to the dock it's generally twice as thick as the ice under the snow right beside the road.
541984,John the Fisherman,2011-01-21 18:27:00,45,The 5 ton is now off the road and at the bottom of the lake in front of Bear Island.  No one was hurt. JTF
541997,smally21,2011-01-21 19:01:00,993,"what a great thread so far. im not saying its funny that the truck is at the bottom of the lake, just the way the thread plays out and your matter of fact updates. i put my chevy into temagami about 10 years back on the ice road going to the south arm. it happens."
542000,irishfield,2011-01-21 19:13:00,26272,I guess Monday would have been the better plan JTF ! 3 more days of -20+ would have helped...
542021,SmokestackLightnin,2011-01-21 19:51:00,390,  Or regularly flooding it.
542034,johnnyb,2011-01-21 20:48:00,3413,The plow is down?!!!?  Noooo!  Good thing nobody was hurt.
542156,gino,2011-01-22 02:25:00,400,"thanks guys for the updates...I'll be careful.we're going there probably the second weekend in february, and thanks Irishfield...i know it's only open on 15, well...that's it , I couldn't get more free days. wish me luck!"
542168,irishfield,2011-01-22 02:33:00,26272,"You'd think that since they end the Laker season, in March, on a weekend.. that they could at least open it .. say Midnight friday.. 2nd weekend in Feb..not on a Tuesday !  So you'll be fishing Whities and Pickeral... find some flats in 40 to 50 FOW.. drill and give it an hour tops. Nothing.. move. We've found 45 feet or so to be the best whitie water over the last 6 years. Pickeral.. we've found them during the day when fishing for lakers/whities.. in 70 FOW believe it or not, but with the slot it's a real gamble if pickeral is what you're targeting. They'll be dead on arrival from that depth. Other great spots.. shoals/points etc as the sun lowers.  Where are you staying??? Will give some light as to how to help  you out."
542923,irishfield,2011-01-24 00:32:00,26272,A Bump for Gino.. and video if anyone wants to see a 5 ton plow do the disappearing act..  http://www.ottertooth.com/Temagami/newsbriefs.htm
542925,BUSTER,2011-01-24 00:33:00,1336,  BUBBYE
542935,Grimace,2011-01-24 01:11:00,2020,Cool video.  Reminds me of a video I saw of a pick up truck trying to pull another pick up out of a similar style hole.  Deep water and 20 feet of chain.  The truck went down and drug the other truck along the ice and it followed.   I forget where I came across it.
542989,gino,2011-01-24 02:58:00,400,"WOW!!! Pretty scary !!! Luckily I don't own a 5 ton plow truck but a little Subaru...I should be safe with that . Wayne, we might be stay at Loonlodge, and we moved our trip for next weekend, 18-20 feb to be sure we catch some trout too. If you have some info and advices for me it will be more than welcome.Cheers! Gino"
542995,Nipfisher,2011-01-24 03:14:00,2449,"  I'm scheduled to go to the Island this week. Maybe, I'll request a pick up at the launch."
543004,irishfield,2011-01-24 03:34:00,26272," They should take care of you well at Loon. Not a spot we generally fish, so I can't offer much for that location.. we either fish well before it down the NE Arm or further up the North Arm and into Kokoko etc. We stay away from drilling anywhere near the ice road to Bear Island etc."
543024,smally21,2011-01-24 12:47:00,993,"check out the big pike on the wall at loon, caught just outside the hub by a friend a few years back"
543050,SmokestackLightnin,2011-01-24 15:12:00,390, Here's my Loon Lodge advice:  Order the steak dinner and get John to cook it medium rare.  Don't take Irene's parking spot.
543066,Lunkerhunter,2011-01-24 17:04:00,455,im headed to loon lodge for mar 7 -11 and staying in one of there ice bungalows! i cant wait  any more advise is much apreciated.  cheers
