543233,scugpg,2011-01-24 23:37:00,1373,"I was looking into getting a buddy heater, either the small or medium size and I see that Princess Auto is completely out of stock. Some other places have them but are about $50 more expensive. Anyone have any leads on stock anywhere that will match?  Thanks!"
543236,vinnimon,2011-01-24 23:40:00,2593,"Try Transaxle mobile power in your area. The salesman dropped off a catalogue, they are in there! Ill take a looksy in the am."
543260,scugpg,2011-01-25 00:27:00,1373,Thanks Vinni. I think closest is Cambridge. Hoping to find one near London if possible.
543267,vinnimon,2011-01-25 00:35:00,2593,"  I will double check in the am, transaxle(cambridge or guelph) dropped a catalogue off on friday. It was in there for a buck and change. As for stock, Im not sure. They may have to order it in. Let me call a friend in the hammer area."
543270,Rob,2011-01-25 00:36:00,467," TSC stores has them on sale this week, not sure about stock though.  Rob"
543330,Moosebunk,2011-01-25 02:44:00,3970,"Cabelas has them on for $69.99... $103 with duty, shipping and taxes in.  But I bet you need it yesterday don't ya. lol."
543332,skeeter,2011-01-25 02:54:00,1907,bass pro $99.94
543338,beginner,2011-01-25 03:05:00,542,walmart has some too but a little bit more $114 pretty sure walmart is everywhere.. gudluck..
543367,irishfield,2011-01-25 04:01:00,26272,I prefer this one myself and a 5 or 20 lb tank. You get over a week of fishing out of a 20 lb'r. carefully turn the burner 90* and it will work upright or laying down as a cooking surface.  http://www.canadiantire.ca/AST/browse/3/HouseHome/1/HeatingAirConditioning/PortableBaseboardHeaters/PRD~0522630P/Portable%252BPropane%252BTank%252BTop%252BHeater.jsp?locale=en  Be forewarned though... you'll end up being the lunch hour chef !
543374,splashhopper,2011-01-25 04:06:00,2931, How long would the 5lb tank last.. .assuming it isn't being run all day ?
543382,irishfield,2011-01-25 04:11:00,26272,All depends on temps and how you like the heat... but at full they say it lasts 35 hours on a 20lb...so would be 8 hour+ on a 5. Pretty sure Ron got 3 days out of his 5lb'r last time he was at my place in Temagami.. might have been only two though. I carry a 20... have never had to refill/change tanks even after 8 days of enough heat to take the chill off and full blast boiling water for Mr Noodles at lunch for the crew or warming our tin foiled wraps.  I also got my burner during a 1/2 price sale at CTC.. $30
543384,splashhopper,2011-01-25 04:15:00,2931," The 5lber appeals to me as I don't have a snowmobile to pull the sled and gear with, so the lighter the better.  Probably going out this weekend with Dutchy as his new shelter just arrived on Friday..."
543387,BillM,2011-01-25 04:34:00,17367,Got an old Coleman 510e coming to me in the mail.  Can't beat the old kerosene heaters..
543419,chefboi17,2011-01-25 14:19:00,128,"I've been looking for a portable buddy too, bass pro only has the big buddy in stock, and princess auto is completely out of all heaters. According to the mr heater web site, true value also carries them."
543422,Fang,2011-01-25 14:37:00,1330,Not sure about the size your after but Liquidation World had some 3000 BTU Coleman Black Cat heaters on a clearout price for $35. I have a 2 person Clam Nanook and the Black Cat cooks that up so I can fish with long sleeve shirt and no coat on most days. On full blast a 1 lb tank last a little over a day in the Black Cat.
543511,scugpg,2011-01-25 19:55:00,1373,Thanks guys I found one at Home Hardware. Got them to price match.  TSC also has them on sale for $90 if you can find stock anywhere. Sale ends in a couple days so you better move on it.  http://www.tscstores.com/stage/mainhome.php#loadFG_215032  Carquest also carries them but won't price match anything
543521,chefboi17,2011-01-25 20:33:00,128,"Checked home hardware, walmart, and al flahertys with zero luck. I guess the search goes on"
543547,scugpg,2011-01-25 22:22:00,1373, tsc in goderich and listowel has some....they will bring in from other stores if you ask
543582,vinnimon,2011-01-26 00:35:00,2593,"Ive got the catalogue from transaxle, buddy heater 129.95, the big buddy heater 189.95.  # to call toll free 1 800 940 7733 cambridge store # 519 740 7213 100 sheldon drive unit 38 &39 cambridge  Promotional catalogue page #21 on the top right.

543590,phiphntek,2011-01-26 00:44:00,115,single burner propane stove.very cheap. Lots of heat and you can heat your coffee or lunch.
543593,vinnimon,2011-01-26 00:47:00,2593," A peak 1 backpacking stove as well, extremely light, including the fuel. Fits in your pocket. Thats what I used and still do at times. And no need for a lighter/match."
