129389,Sinker,2007-11-02 20:53:00,8692,"Lew, that was a great read.  I would say that all of your family that you've lost would want you to be at quinte every spring, until you can no longer make the trip. Keep those memories alive. I'm sure it would be tough, but I also know they would all be there with you in some way, shape or form.  Sinker"
129410,ccmtcanada,2007-11-02 21:57:00,7971,"Lew...that was more eloquently written than the article I posted!  Very heartwarming....awesome pictures.  Thanks for sharing those memories with us.  My dad was my teacher and early fishing partner, and while I stopped the sport, we still got out to Quinte a few months before he died of cancer.  That's a trip I'll never forget, and although he's not with me anymore, I look up in the sky on every fishing trip and say ""hi"" to him.  Dont give up on it...I know it's hard with the memories, but that's a tradition that should be continued....when you're ready."
129441,Moosebunk,2007-11-02 23:07:00,3970,"Geez Lew, walleye takes on a whole different meaning to you.  Thanks for sharing that.  Awesome but emotional read."
129580,Rizzo,2007-11-03 17:47:00,4754,Very well said Lew.  If I had those kind of partners/memories I'd enjoy pickerel fishing too.
129734,Cookslav,2007-11-04 03:43:00,1457,"Lew you have a way with words....  I spend a lot of time fishing with Family, and I cherish every trip...fish or no fish Thanks for putting things in perspective."
129897,fishnsled,2007-11-04 17:25:00,3520,"Great post Cliff.  Lew, that was great.  As for walleye (pickeral if you must   ) I find I'll fish them in the spring and then again in the fall.  Ususally for a meal but when it comes to the Quinte big guns, I'm just looking for a new PB, all of those get released.   What's to love about them?  I think Deano nailed it, it's about the taste.  Almost everyone loves a feed of fresh fillets.  The fight can be very lame (I thought my PB was a piece of driftwood until it got to the boat.) but I've had them fight and pull out line like their life depended on it.  On a given day it just might have."
129330,Cookslav,2007-11-02 18:03:00,1457,"I guess it depends on how you want to fish? For me 50% of fishing is the fight....the other 50% is the actual hook up after locating them, and enticing the strike. Pickerel Fishing on open water can be as, or more challenging to locate fish then say Bass, or Salmon etc.... Just depends I guess?  Heck I've caught Specs that feel like I'm pulling in a wet sock only to spaz at the boat but its to late by then... Then Last year Big Swede and I were fishing the BOQ and he nailed a 36"" Pike that was Fatter then I've ever seen...an absolute tank. But it came in like a log....awesome fish, but disappointing fight for sure, it actually fought considerably less then the 31"" pickerel I pulled in about an hour later, and that isn’t saying much LOL! But really it doesn't matter to me if they fight or not.  The species I decide to Target is based on the season usually...we have such a variety of options here in Ontario, why not switch it up and keep it fresh right?  A great fight is certainly revered, and I'd rather have an epic battle then walk the dog any day, but for me Targeting the Species, feeling out the Patterns, finding the colors, depths, speeds, running the Planners or riggers, playing the elements etc... That’s the challenge, and the enjoyment aspect of Pickerel fishing."
129383,lew,2007-11-02 20:30:00,12767,"Pickeral (walleye) fish'n to me isn't about catching a fish, it's about memories.  I only fish for them about 4 days a year, the long weekend in May on one of my favorite lakes in the world, the Bay of Quinte. That's a trip and a tradition in my family that started way back in 1955 and has pretty well continued until the present.  Myself at 9 years old, my brother Ed at 8, my dad and my grandfather, went to Hay Bay for the 1st time in search of pickeral. We found a little general store beside the water and stopped to ask if he knew of any campgrounds in the area. He said we could pitch our tent in his backyard and seeing as it was right beside the water, we could launch our 15' cedarstrip there too.  That little backyard went on the become Pickeral Park, one of the Hay Bay landmarks of today, and we were about his 1st ever campers.  For many many years after, My grandfather, dad, brother & myself looked forward all winter to that trip and it never failed to be fabulous. Hot & sunny, cold & wet, even some years with snow, we always had a wonderful time and were building memories as we went.  Over the years, we gained a few members to our group, and sometimes lost a few, but the 4 of us continued and it was still always one of my best trips of any other time of the year.  Eventually, my grandfather died and he was missed terribly on those camping trips, but the remaining 3 of us kept going and then eventually my son was old enough to come along and he enjoyed it as much as the rest of us and sort of took my grandfathers spot.  Ten years ago, my dad died and that was terrible and as was his father, my dad was missed  on these  trips too, but myself, Ed, and my son  continued going every year. It was tough without my dad, but again the memories helped get us thru it and we continued to have wonderful trips.  Three years ago, my son was killed and I thought my world would end.  I didn't know what the Quinte trip would be like without my son along, but myself and Ed went anyway and made the best of it, but it was really getting tougher to enjoy myself now with most of my family gone, but the fabulous memories of past trips kept me going.  Now, it was only Ed & I left and we were sposed to go to Quinte last May 17th as we'd done for 50 odd years, but then  Ed got sick and died the same day we were spose to leave.  Now my fishing world has completely fallen apart.  I've lost all the men in my family that I spent so many wonderful fishing trips with, the people that taught me how to cast and retrieve, clean a pickeral, pitch a tent, build a campfire. I'm the only male left on my entire side of the family now and I hafta tell you, it's getting very lonely now.  No pickeral trip to Quinte will ever be as good again, infact I don't even know if I COULD go to Quinte again, but I have memories, infact so many memories and their all good. Fabulous memories of so many unbelievable trips with so many great people.  Even if I never see Quinte or another pickeral again, I'll still be a happy man every time I think of past trips, and bonfires, and tents and sleeping in the backyard of a general store on the shores of Hay Bay, so many years ago.  And to me, that's ""What's to love about walleye"".......er pickeral         "
