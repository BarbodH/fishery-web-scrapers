129558,Whopper,2007-11-03 14:49:00,2174,Well done Dawg!  Looks like a good time to me  Thanks for sharing!
129560,steve_paul,2007-11-03 15:16:00,658,"Great report GCD, thanks.  I think that is the first 3some pic with nudity on OFC too"
129561,lew,2007-11-03 15:21:00,12767,"Ahhh yes Glen, a fine day of fish'n indeed  Very nice !!"
129562,Bly,2007-11-03 15:24:00,1556,Sounds like you had a lot of fun...congrats on the good day and thanks for the fish porn!  Love the results you get with that sabiki!
129565,Roy,2007-11-03 15:26:00,13728,"A great report there Bubba. Looks like you had a super day.  I imagine the Sabikis would not be legal here because of the number of hooks. The baits sure look tasty though. Correct me if I'm wrong, aren't the yellow bass a member of the perch family? Very nice report for sure. BTW, had you still been using a 35mm camera, this report would have cost you $15 in photo processing."

I was out yesterday too, but I had on a pair of lined jeans, a T shirt covered by a double layered reversible hooded sweat shirt and then covered by what you guys down there would call a winter coat. And it was still a little chilly going along at full throttle. 75 degrees....niiiiccce."
