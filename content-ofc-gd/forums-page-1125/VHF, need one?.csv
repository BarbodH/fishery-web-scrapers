129713,BFSC Kevin,2007-11-04 02:42:00,1351,"Just looking around the net and saw a handheld unit. So that got me thinking if I need one? I read this ""You must have a Restricted Radiotelephone Operator's Certificate (ROC) to transmit on a VHF marine radio. Simply owning or listening to a VHF radio does not require a licence."" from http://boating.ncf.ca/vhf.html I'm assuming it is true? For me, I don't think I will be in open water much. Might be heading out to Lake O next year actually. Would a handheld unit do? also on the site, it recommends a unit that has these; * Marine radio with DSC (transmits position/time if connected to a GPS via NMEA 0183) * 25-watt transmit power (5w if hand-held) * Switch for low-power 1-watt transmit * All legally-allowed International-Canadian-USA channels * 10 weather channels * Visible transmission indicator * Readable display, adjustable backlighting * 1-year warranty * Hand-held: rechargable NiMH battery is good, but Lithium lasts longer. * Hand-held: Battery charger, second battery  Any opinions?"
129720,Gerritt,2007-11-04 03:07:00,6129,Kevin... While I dont own a VHS yet.. I will... and have friends that do.. and they all say the same thing.. DONT get a handheld... if you need it when it counts.. you will be happy you have a 8' antenna and the extra transmitting power the stationary units afford.  G.
129723,BFSC Kevin,2007-11-04 03:23:00,1351,"Thanks for your input Gerrit. Right now i have some old hummingbird fishfinder on the boat, I was thinking of getting a gps/radio(https://buy.garmin.com/shop/shop.do?pID=283), which i can also use for ice fishing(cheaper option, which will probably make me stay closer, I doubt i'll be head too far out anyways, maybe when i do go out further, i'll do the below option.. lol)  or i can get a new gps/sonar and a stationary radio and get a handheld for ice fishing(VERY expensive option! but new toys:D)   kevin   *oh wait, i just realized, the humingbird ff on my dash, i can stick that at the bow since my powerdrive has universal sonar... then i could get a sonar/gps and a radio... yikes.. B.O.A.T."
129724,fishindevil,2007-11-04 03:27:00,6254,"Yes kevin,thats exactly what you need...DO NOT GET A HANDHELD VHF...get a mountable model...and one that has all those features...i got mine at bass pro shops for just under $170.00 and it works amazing and with my booster on my small antenae,i can get 12-16 miles somedays no problem....."
129737,BFSC Kevin,2007-11-04 03:51:00,1351,any brand in particular to stay away from or any you favour?
129774,Gerritt,2007-11-04 12:48:00,6129,"Raytheon, Uniden and Cobra all seem to be popular models.  G."
129778,Roy,2007-11-04 12:53:00,13728,All good choices and the Lowrance ain't bad either.
129779,Gerritt,2007-11-04 12:55:00,6129,I just had a look at radio world online.... and they have DROPPED all their prices due to the CDN dollar.. Now get shopping!  Gerritt.
129890,BFSC Kevin,2007-11-04 17:09:00,1351,"So.. i'm eyeing this one for VHF http://radioworld.ca/product_info.php?products_id=542 and this these two for gps/sonar, the second is priced at that because they were meant to be warranty replacements but they are brand new. Does that mean they dont come with the transducer? http://www.cabelas.com/cabelas/en/template...ndexId=cat21448 http://www.cabelas.com/cabelas/en/template...dexId=cat602012  So pretty much, I'd be getting these two things just in time for BOQ, use it maybe two or three times max before i need to put it away. IS it too good of  a deal and i'll need it that much to justify the purchase? instead of maybe waiting out till next year?  opinions please?"
129964,fishnsled,2007-11-04 21:21:00,3520,"As for the VHF radio, you'll do fine with your choice.  I took the course in the spring time and my instructor had bought this model for his boat.  Solara DSC  The DSC (Digital Selective Calling) in an awesome feature to have.  When hooked up to a GPS, all you have to do is hit the DSC button and it will transmit your location to the coast guard if your in an emergency situation and can't talk on the radio.  Ie. boat sinking/on fire, health concerns etc.  I highly recommend that you take the course, money well spent and if you have the radio you'll want to be able to use it.  Right now I have a handheld unit (suited me fine for my purposes so far) but a fixed mount unit is on the Christmas list as I plan to be on Lake Ontario more often next year.  As for the gps/sonar units, you'll do fine with either unit.  I'd call them to find out about the transducer and antenna for the gps to see in they are include on the warranty units. I haven't priced out these units recently but they look like a good deal from checking out a couple of other sites on similar models.  Good luck with the purchases."
129970,Fisherman,2007-11-04 21:34:00,7201,"And least but not last, don't scrimp on a cheap antenna, quality does make a difference, if your trying to talk out of the end of a limp noodle....well, it's sort of like presenting the wife a limp noodle."
129971,fishnsled,2007-11-04 21:36:00,3520, 
129977,Terry,2007-11-04 21:54:00,14456,"just  to be different...... if you are only going to use it in one boat, get a fixed mount  but if you want to be flexible get a good handheld and a good fixed antenna and it will do everything a fixed unit will do  you and buy a mount and 12v connector  and it is the same as the fixed mount"
130024,fishdawg,2007-11-05 00:03:00,912,Lowrance makes an excellent fixed model with all the features any angler would need LB's lists them at $120 - ask your local shop to match that price - mine did
130030,taper,2007-11-05 00:25:00,611,"I like any thing with the Lowrance name, it has never let me down. But I must say, I have the Uniden Solara as Fishnsled mentioned and it has been a very good radio so far."
