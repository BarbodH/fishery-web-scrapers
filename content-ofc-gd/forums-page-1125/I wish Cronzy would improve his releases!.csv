130389,Gerritt,2007-11-06 02:22:00,6129,I would be thrilled if they were in camo cooking my meal and washing up after.... other then that I consider them useless... Their show is complete crap.. I cant stand to listen to them blather on about nothing. Just like I cant stand watching paint dry..  As for Darryl.. well I grew up watching him.. others had Red and Bill... do I think he would batter your arm and lick his lips?? for sure I do!! but does he also bring alot of positive to the community?? well I also believe this to be true.  I have to say I used to look forward to watching him as a youngster on the tube....  The new generation has EXTREME everything...  My Generation had Darryl  And the Generation before me (the majority here) had Red etc...  even fishing moves with the times..  I am not ready to take anything to the EXTREME just yet... as is sounds like it will hurt in the morning...  Gerritt.
130423,jughead,2007-11-06 09:57:00,92,"Wow Gerrit, that's great. I'm sure the female members of the board appreciate the enlightened attitude - shut up, cook and clean.  As for the sponsorship thing, it is a necessary evil. Until WFN came along fishing shows were almost entirely self-produced. The networks that air them would give next to no money but would let the producer keep and sell the commercial air time within the 1/2 hour of their show. Sponsors wanted more than simply having their add run at commercial break so product placement was embedded in the show. Just about every show does it, Choronzy, Italo, Izumi, Babe Winkleman, Shelly & Courtney, etc.  As for Choronzy, he blathers on more than any other host but I can always switch the channel so it hasn't become much of an issue for me. If he wants to keep and eat some fish, that's fine. Many of us do as well. I just wish he wouldn't talk with his mouth full, it's poor manners."

130437,lew,2007-11-06 11:52:00,12767,And I STILL say you guys are jealous of Shelly & Courtney........   A couple gurls can get paid to fish & you can't
130439,Gerritt,2007-11-06 12:20:00,6129,  Jugzie... most of the female anglers here personally know me and know that in no way is it an insult directed towards them.. but thanks for your concern.  Gerritt.
130441,huey graphite,2007-11-06 12:40:00,362,"  That's hilarious!   Just my 2 cents.....not all, but many species break the surface and jump much higher than the height Chrozy is releasing them from. Is he really doing that much harm? And if we are all so concerned for the well being of the fish, perhaps we should stop fishing.  Having said that, not all species can survive a rough release and it takes little effort to release them more gracefully to increase chances of survival.  Arguments like this just divide us and give fodder to the likes of P3TA."
130442,Fisherman,2007-11-06 12:40:00,7201,"Wow Jughead, looks like you're really in tune with the girls...now stand a little closer to the sink, you're splashing water on the floor."
130445,Bassloadingzone,2007-11-06 12:48:00,32,"Set the hook as hard as you can,with a 3/0 hook drag it back to the boat,pinch it by the lip, rip the hook out with a pair of pliers, hang it by its head and take a picture, maybe drop it a couple of times in the boat, now bend over and put it in the water gently cus you wouldnt want it to hit the water to hard.What a freakin joke, who started this,shake your head"
130449,jughead,2007-11-06 13:00:00,92," Whatever, at least you make it easier for the rest of us the separate the imbeciles from the pack.  And Gerritt, there's really only one way to read what you wrote irregardless of how you want to back track and spin it.  Now if you all will excuse me, I have some dishes to do."
130452,Gerritt,2007-11-06 13:09:00,6129,"back track and spin? no where did I do that... I simply answered your comment with the facts... if that is putting a spin on things then you need to have your sense of reality checked.  Again those that KNOW me understand my comments. infact I have fished with most of the females on this forum even shared more then a couple beers with many of them.. Perhaps you should consult our female members before you become their ""self appointed guardian""  be sure to use a good moisturizer after your done the dishes.. I would hate to see your hands get dry and cracked given the weather.  Enjoy your day!  Gerritt."
130457,Bly,2007-11-06 13:24:00,1556,"As a female angler on this board, I have had the pleasure of Gerritt's company on several occasions, including fishing on his boat, and I took NO offense what-so-ever in his comment.  He's a great guy, very considerate and willing to drop whatever he's working on to help out a friend....male or female."
130458,Meely,2007-11-06 13:29:00,282,be sure to use a good moisturizer after your done the dishes.   I would hate to see your hands get dry and cracked......may hinder your vacuuming !   LOL..... Just kidding ladies.....  Meely
130130,bowshep,2007-11-05 10:54:00,378,"Its All about Edict and no one wants to talk about it. l have posted 2 times about edict and they have been locked. Fishing edict is just passed down from one person to another but its not in a book because ooooooowwwwwwwww its personal, people will get offended or other people will blow it out of per potion. What is the rule of releasing a fish in the words the regs are not a 100% the use the word 'immediately' did anyone look the word up in the dictionary... to release it at the same time with out anytime (medium) in between you see its impossible. How do you net the fish... how far do you stay away from other fishermen, in a boat people get ticked at 100' but on a pier or a river bank you have your 4' space and don't move... The only way these guys are going to smarten up is if we hassle the sponsors of the show, but what prof are you going to have because you are only expressing your opinion as an individual. With the knowledge we have on this board we all can create a book on ""Edict of Fishing"" and that should include all the water stuff. lt should include start times(Waiting Sucks). Transporting you boat,  Boat ramps and then we can work on, What you can use, how to catch, how to release. Set the Questions up like a pole, tell all the sandbox kids to play nice and lets get it done. Yes its work. Yes it will be a pain. But no one else in the fishing world is doing anything about it after all you can still by bats in some of the fishing stores...    <_<  <_<  <_< Peace Ken"
130133,Fisherman,2007-11-05 12:23:00,7201,"Edict, okay, how about Ethics and whether it be the ethics of fishing or driving there's not too many people that follow either.  There's always someone that has to say or comment which end of the fish goes in first, maybe they should look in their own underwear and see why it smells funny around them."
130169,pikehunter,2007-11-05 14:29:00,1659,"He may be a bit rough around the edges but that is what makes him unique. I enjoy the way he speaks his mind.  It's kind of fun to see how many times and how he can finesse a sponsors name into the chatter! Reminds me of Tim Allen's old TV show ""Tooltime"" Tim would sneak the Binford name in every chance he could. Same as what's his name's show, ""This Old House"" which Tooltime was a take off, get a sponsors name or label worked into the shot as much as you can.  However.... he keeps the catch out of the water   for what seems like an eternity but geesh the fish is a TV star!  After all it's lucky not to become a shore lunch all coated in his new fish batter.  I practice C&R but I do keep some edible fish if I feel I want to, so I don't condemn him for that.  Cheers Daryl."
130174,Greencoachdog,2007-11-05 14:41:00,8163,There's a little button on the remote control to the TV that will select another channel if you push it...
130195,Bassloadingzone,2007-11-05 15:19:00,32,I would rather watch him eat lunch all day than sit through 5 minutes of FISH-O MANIA
130196,Mike Pike,2007-11-05 15:20:00,1332,"LOL!!!!!!!  Personally, I don't like any show host holding fish out of water while chatting too, but what the hey, we hold fish for photos so really, what makes that much different in the over all scheme of things?  Although I don't agree with all of Daryl's polictics and comments, I generally like his show.  He is, for lack of a better term, real.  In this day of 'manufactured' tv types who walk the politically correct line all the time, he is exactly what you see.  I also like the shows with his son and I think Josh will make a great host of that show when the 'old man' decides to hang 'em up."
130200,outdoorguy61,2007-11-05 15:26:00,220,"I personally believe that a lot of show hosts could do a better job at releasing fish. Most are like dinosaurs. Sorry to be a bit rough, as I have no doubt that this will slowly improve as they collectively learn from the likes of Dr. Bruce Tuft (Queens U-  live release expert) and some of the Americans.  I had the opportunity to observe an emailed responce by the gentleman originally mentioned and was not impressed. I like independent thought, and lost a lot of faith in him (was on the FishBC board on the web).  outdoorguy61"
130304,Rich,2007-11-05 22:19:00,3927,"I'm sorry but how is Darryl real? The only places he fished in the last 8 years on his show were expensive lodges that nobody who earns a real paycheck could ever afford, where the fishing is so easy. I like when he acts like a certain new color of lure he got from his sponsor is working for him. You could use a bare hook and get the same results where he's fishing! Same reason I don't like 90% of hte fishing shows these days. People pay to go to these lodges because the fishing is easy, plain and simple. They get free trips to these places so they can look good catching a million fish and promote a sponsor product. He's the same as all the other hosts, the only thing different is that he promotes catch and eat while most others are all about the catch and release.  Grrrrrr.. that's my rant"
130308,solopaddler,2007-11-05 22:35:00,8605,"Hey no one's perfect. It's probably not a great idea to hurl stones when you live in a glass house either... Personally I like Cronz, faults and all. Over the course of his career he's been the voice of the common man here in Ontario when it comes to fishery issues, and has undoubtedly done more than anyone on this board to promote and enhance the sport... Heck, just last year it was HIS initiative that started the ball rolling with the steelhead stocking in the Saugeen river. Something that will very likely result in the 'Geen becoming THE premier great lakes steelhead river. "
130347,Rizzo,2007-11-06 00:22:00,4754," yes, I believe he built a ""fish ladder"" that ends right in his fridge   sorry, couldn't resist."
130363,PatrickGG,2007-11-06 00:52:00,562,"I seen a few shows where Cronzy is very sloppy at releasing fish and as for his E-mail response thats just totally garbage, In regards to Italo hes good when it comes to kids and very informative but he speaks to much about his sponsorship it kinda reminds me about rapala commercials wrapped up into a fishing show, I met Italo and i thought he was just to Egotistic and Arrogant when it came to the older crowd asking him or inquiring him about certain things in regards to fishing, Just my input.  P.S Courtney and Shelly are two sexy fisher girlz and i would be thrilled to meet them in person  ."
