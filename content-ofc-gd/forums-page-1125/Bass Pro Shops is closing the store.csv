129642,misfish,2007-11-04 00:26:00,29133,"Bass Pro Shops is closing the store for an evening to allow only member of the OFAH to come in and shop and get first crack at holiday sale items. There will be snacks and beverages, draws etc. Bring your OFAH membership card to get in. It will be Sunday November 25 from 7-9pm."
129648,Clampet,2007-11-04 00:34:00,1947,Fer a minute there I plum thought they we're goin to shut her down fer good!
129661,Deano,2007-11-04 01:03:00,767,"Ok, my heart skipped a beat there."
129716,HTHM,2007-11-04 02:51:00,4082,"As great as the store is, should we not try to support the local tackle shops that are run by a guy who loves fishing. Just a thought."
129725,douG,2007-11-04 03:29:00,2693,"Agree, HTHM, I give JB's lotsa business.  I buy from him about 6 x per year.  However,  there comes a time, a good deal,  gotta go for it."
129748,Photoz,2007-11-04 08:33:00,792,That sounds like about the same time Lebaron's has their 'NO TAX' pre-Christmas sale?? hm m m m  m   ??
129749,motv8tr,2007-11-04 08:46:00,2587,"Thanks for the heads up Brian, I'll have to think about that one.  Maureen"
129817,ccmtcanada,2007-11-04 14:05:00,7971,Cool...we have the family OFAH membership....we'll have to check this one out!  Thanks for the info Brian.
129852,lunkerbasshunter,2007-11-04 15:12:00,2585,love that store!  i know service is better at the smaller bait shops but this store is one like porn for fishermen!  I love it!  Cheers!
129856,Snypa,2007-11-04 15:14:00,25,  Thanks for the reminder !
129860,buckster,2007-11-04 15:17:00,530,I would like to support local shops but only one problem it seems like everything i want they have to order in.  I guess im to impatient lol  my 2 cents
129992,Canuck2fan,2007-11-04 22:52:00,1444," Yeah we should but what do you do when you go in 3 or 4 times and he has promised you the goods but they are never there? He claims he orders 4 cases and only gets one.... So by the time his buds and the staff are done they don't have what I want, in the last 6 trips in there. I could live the 25% higher cost on the small stuff but if I drop 2 to 3 grand a year on goodies I need to save money on the bigger stuff or do without..... (which ain't going to happen) LOL"
130004,urbanangler1990,2007-11-04 23:33:00,933,how do i get a membership card?
130006,mbac31,2007-11-04 23:37:00,904,Just go on www.basspro.com and click on the box on the right for store selection and click on the outlet store. The stuff is always cheaper than our Basspro here. I've been doing it for a while now and always save a ton.
130011,urbanangler1990,2007-11-04 23:45:00,933,"www.baspro.com  it gives me some casino, lol, i bet u save a lot, MUST LOSE A LOT ALSO"
130166,tonyb,2007-11-05 14:11:00,1637,I saw that in the lates OOD magazine...yeah I'll drive for an hour on a Sunday night at 7pm to go shopping for overpriced tackle
130176,bbog,2007-11-05 14:44:00,665,I'm with tonyb - don't need the drive (on a specified date and time) for overpriced stuff - I really don't need right now.
130289,mbac31,2007-11-05 21:44:00,904, Yeah I guess I should double check the info before submitting it.
130326,holdfast,2007-11-05 23:16:00,1813,"For a second I thought they were closing to lower prices.  You know, since we're at a dollar seven above par.  I know its a great store, but how about giving back what us customers gave to."
130329,Roy,2007-11-05 23:42:00,13728,Thanks Brian for posting that.
130353,Gerritt,2007-11-06 00:30:00,6129,Daiwa Sealine 47's 113.00 from BPS (or 95.00 USD if I ordered online).... From Bills Bait N Tackle... $90.00 CDN and no shipping charges. Seeing as how I was buying two... the choice was obvious.. even if I needed to wait a couple days for them..  Given BPS's buying power... Surely they could do better... 50.00+ is better in my pocket then in anyone else's..  Seems I can get alot of items for alot less money Locally then at BPS given the current market... I hope BPS catches up... (Cabelas has a thriving Canadian mail order business it seems as of Late)   Just my 1.0718 worth.  Gerritt.
130356,irishfield,2007-11-06 00:36:00,26272,"As Roy..try to point out..I think's youz all is ranting in the wrong place. Brian was nice enough to give a heads up to a ""gathering"" of OFAH members at BPS...and other than ""THANKS BRIAN""...it really should end there unless you want directions to the store, or are looking for another OFAH member to hook up with to go rub shoulders with the masses."
