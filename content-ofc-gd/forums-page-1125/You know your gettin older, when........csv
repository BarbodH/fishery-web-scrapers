129542,bigfish1965,2007-11-03 13:17:00,3382,I'm 42 soon and bought an eyebrows trimming device. Started to look like a sheep dog and it was getting hard to see. Now I just brush them with this thing and the hair goes away. Still got lots of hair on my head too. Last time I got it cut they even had to thin it out  bit. Just thought I would rub it in ( to your shiny heads).
129958,JohnF,2007-11-04 20:56:00,3494, Don't do it. Makes one look stupid. Nurture the ear hairs instead.  JF
130005,kuhaman,2007-11-04 23:36:00,503,All the extra hair is just to help keep ya warm when your ice fishn
129285,lew,2007-11-02 16:04:00,12767,"......when the barber asked me this mornin if I wanted my eyebrows trimmed  sheeeesh, that can't be a good sign"

129289,SlowPoke,2007-11-02 16:06:00,2984,"Lew, I'm 38 and saving my eyebrows for a comb-over. Quit your whining! -Brian"
129292,douG,2007-11-02 16:15:00,2693,"Yup,  as we age, hair stops growing up and out the top of our heads, turns around, and starts growing down and out the eyebones, nose and ears."
129294,Deano,2007-11-02 16:18:00,767,"Yep Lew, you know your getting old when ..............................              Nevermind, it'll come back to me"

129299,ketchenany,2007-11-02 16:29:00,3229,You should have told him that you use them as curb-feelers when you wake up at 4. It's only a number Lew don't worry . . .
129314,Bitsmith2k,2007-11-02 17:07:00,396, i'm saving my back hair for the day science will allow it to be transplanted to my head....
129316,lew,2007-11-02 17:11:00,12767,"Well, I don't feel so bad now, seeing as most of you guys appear to be doing much worse than me"
129322,Whopper,2007-11-02 17:31:00,2174,This thread is too funny
129325,lew,2007-11-02 17:41:00,12767," Well, sure Phil, it WOULD be funny to you,  you don't have eyebrows down to your knees  At least that's how my barber explained it to me"
129327,Whopper,2007-11-02 17:49:00,2174,Well Lew your right lol  The thing is my hair wouldn't have to be that long to get to my knees...I've got that other Italian Mans disease.....
129332,Badger Shark,2007-11-02 18:14:00,291,"Im 38 and usually I cut my own hair but about 6years ago I was going to a wedding and had no time so went to the barbers and he just went ahead and trimmed them and the whole time I am thinking "" Oh my god what the heck is goin on here? ""  I just wanted my hair cut, this really got to me and started a mid life crisis I think a bit early.  I went home and told my girlfriend and my cousin and they laughed.  Then I said to my cousin, your six years younger than me and almost bald so Shut up!  We laughed a bunch and this always comes up still and we laugh about how weird our bodies get when we get older.  Less hair on your head and more hair in other places I dont need hair!  What the heck is going on?    Sorry for this silly rant but it is a funny thread!"
129334,fishindevil,2007-11-02 18:19:00,6254,Yes lew....thats too funnnyyyyy...LOL..LOL. and i felt bad having to have to lick mine with my toungue to keep them from pointing all over the place.....
129335,Roy,2007-11-02 18:23:00,13728,"I don't suppose  he was foolish enough to touch the stache was he, Lew?"
129338,Headhunter,2007-11-02 18:33:00,5703,"I got real lucky when I moved to my new house and found a barber, yes a barber to cut my hair! I don't want loud music, I don't want gle in my hair, I don't want some young floozy, dangling her bosoms over my face while she washes my hair... hold on a minute, maybe I do!LOL Jimmy is his name and he cuts all the hair you need cut, without being told! I can't tell yah how happy I was when he finally cut the braids, dangling from my nose!LOL And $9.00 ta boot! HH"
129346,Whopper,2007-11-02 18:53:00,2174, ROFLMAO and this would be a problem HH  NOT
129364,Kirk,2007-11-02 19:23:00,347,"hair? barber? whats that? Lew you really need to stop rubbing salt.  HH, I like the way you think"
129367,irishfield,2007-11-02 19:29:00,26272, No wonder she loves you so much!
129394,Handlebarz,2007-11-02 21:00:00,3790,Well I see a market here I think I will start to bag my hair when I trim it up and sell it I see more baits in my future. Its funny the ones who want the hair cant get it but us who dont it will not stop growing.
129499,crappieperchhunter,2007-11-03 01:53:00,2582,"LOL Debbe is staring over my shoulder as I have invited her to read this thread. At 34 I had about 10 chest hairs...maybe 11....and normal? eyebrows. At 44 chest hairs are sprouting everywhere and I was FORCED to trim my own eyebrows starting about a year ago....  What the heck?????  She says...I thought this was a fishing site???? You got some sick puppies on there!!!  Gotta love this thread..thank you LEW...I feel SOOOOOOO much better. Ditto to my ""Eyetalian"" buddy Meely....another good chuckle."

129539,aplumma,2007-11-03 12:53:00,6896,Wait till he trims the hair IN your ears instead of the hair along the edges. The first time I almost came out of the chair with the buzzing so loud.  Art
