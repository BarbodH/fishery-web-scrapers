129710,Sandbag,2007-11-04 02:32:00,533,"Well....just booked the annual ice fishing trip with seven friends from work.  This year we are heading back to Sandy Bay Cottages on Callendar bay Feb. 11, 12, 13/08.  This is a Monday-Wednesday trip this year.  I find it much more relaxing and more productive mid-week than trying to fish with the masses on the weekends.  If anybody else happens to be heading up to the area at the same time, I would love to meet with you and maybe share a few lies over a cold Sasparilla.  I know lots here still have plenty of softwater action planned, but when your planing a trip for eight people you have to look far enough ahead.  Cheers to all and good luck to all the folks heading to Quinte over the next few weeks.  be safe  Craig"
