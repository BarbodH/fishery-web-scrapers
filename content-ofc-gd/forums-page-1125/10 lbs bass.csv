Most of my fishing is after work in the dark.  I have been skunked all week.  Except for the one rock bass I caught.  Sunday morning proved no different.  A gorgeous morning, no wind, flat water.  I was the only boat out there.  Oh well, I got to enjoy the day.  After being out for four hours and not even catching some salad, I decide to go to a spot that I frequented in the spring.  I throw my line in the water, sit a bit.  I feel a tap, I set the hook nothing.  Stand perfectly still, leave the lure to sit, maybe it'll come back.  BAMM!!!  My rod is buckled over, drag is screaming.   CRAP, CRAP, CRAP I caught bottom in a strong current.  I start to reel in and then the line sarts going out at an amazing speed.  I've got a smallie hooked.  Drag must be too loose cause I'm getting spooled.  Adjust the drag and reel in.  After a bit I see "" the monster""  Oh crap I'm going to loose it.  Get it to the boat, and it takes off again.  Does this three or four times.  My heart is pumping.  I very carefully get it into the boat.  With a sigh of releif and a hoollyy crraaapp!!!  I get this fish in the boat and can't believe it didn't get off.  A 32 inch 10 LBS pike, on a j hook with a cinko.  I'm going for bass.  No hardware on the line, what a rush.  I then through a line in again and produce the fish I am after.  A 3.8 lbs smallie.  Only caught two fish all day, but they were nice to catch.   What a way to enjoy a day off!!!   "

130165,cranks bait,2007-11-05 14:10:00,721,"I knew it would get people looking.  I did it in jest.  I was going after bass, as you can see the lure and cinko in the pic.  I almost had a heart attack when I first saw it coming out of the water.  I was fishing bass, what the heck is a pike doing on my line???"
130216,fishindevil,2007-11-05 15:54:00,6254,"Very nice catch !!!!!!!  thats a big pike,and a beauty of a fat fall smallie !!!!!   well done,sure gets the heart pumping doesnt it??......cheers"

130301,cranks bait,2007-11-05 22:14:00,721,"Haven't figured out the quote part of this yet, but to answer your question Jigger.  I had my boat in about 2 feet of water on the edge of a shoal that goes down 20 ft.  I caught the pike in about 2-3 feet of water right up on shore.  The bass I caught after letting it drop about 10 feet into the hole.  These are average sized fish for me here.  I've just never caught a pike with naked line before."
130302,addict,2007-11-05 22:16:00,475,nice gator and smallie combo wtg.
130303,Rich Clemens,2007-11-05 22:17:00,3131,Very Very nice fish.  Never seen one of lone slender toothy bass before.  Now I know.  Probably goes along the lines of Walleye fisherman catching musky.  (Congrats on the very nice pike Cranks).
