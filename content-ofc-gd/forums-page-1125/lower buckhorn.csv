130327,Kawartha Kev,2007-11-05 23:22:00,281,I have a cottage on Lower Buckhorn and I closed it up a week ago. Just to let you know they have dropped the water level so be very careful. The lake is good for musky fishing but dangerous for rocks and with the water level down it is even more so.  Kawartha Kev
130332,lew,2007-11-05 23:47:00,12767,"The north half of the lake is shallower with lots of rocks as metioned by Kawartha Kev, while the south side is for the most part, much deeper & safer.  You'll still find plenty of green weed, specially in the deeper sections, and if you can find it adjacent to the rocks, all the better.  Work the deeper weed edges, plus the rock - weed transitions with some large supending baits with plenty of hang time and slower than you would have a month ago, and you could be a happy fisherman.  Don't ferget your camera and good luck."
130336,Kawartha Kev,2007-11-05 23:52:00,281,"I agree Lew the north side of the lake is shallower and rockier which is where my cottage is located and the south side deeper and safer. Anywhere outside the main channel to the north and you could be in trouble. The level was down about 6""to8"" I would estimate at my dock.  Kev"
