We have to worry about Malachite Green a cancer causing agent they use to kill bacteria. Their fish farms are overcrowded and no wonder everything is diseased. I don't trust anything that comes from China and now am looking to catch my own fish when the ice arrives. Here's an article you'll find interesting.  http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/stor...me=&no_ads=   I am trying to target put and take fisheries so as not to go after the natural population. If anyone has any info about where I could go for splake and rainbow within a 3-4 drive from Toronto that would be greatly appreciated. Thanks.....pm me if you want."
