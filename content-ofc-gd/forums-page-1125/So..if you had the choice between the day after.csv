130073,irishfield,2007-11-05 02:04:00,26272,"I was waitin for Lew or Dan to chime in and say ""let me check my calender"" Don ! LOL  I've got too much to accomplish this week...but I'm getting that ""need"" again already !"
130074,Jigger,2007-11-05 02:05:00,1237,"Theres guys here that know a heck of alot more about musky than me here. But during the summer, if theres been a few days of stable weather, I'd want to be on the water the day the weather breaks. Try and be on a spot maybe I'd raised a fish recently, but not been able to convert. Sometimes the weather change gets the big girls going."
130128,lew,2007-11-05 10:13:00,12767,  You know me too well Wayne .....  I checked my calander........and now you have an email

130167,lew,2007-11-05 14:19:00,12767,"Nuthin wrong with fishing in the snow Wayne, at least we won't be bothered by skeeters   "
