130217,ccmtcanada,2007-11-05 15:55:00,7971,Here's a bunch of products from the Cabelas website....  http://www.cabelas.com/cabelas/en/common/s...c&noImage=0
130268,Terry,2007-11-05 19:35:00,14456,a bunch of those are jack plate not trim  I had an after market trim on an 80hp and it worked real well  for smaller motors you can make up one with a car jack and a ratchet and two metal plates on a hinge I had one years ago on a 35hp and it really made a difference in the speed of the boat and control in waves
130284,JorgeCarlos,2007-11-05 21:24:00,109,Terry any idea where can i get one and how much???  thanks i appreciate your help

130391,ccmtcanada,2007-11-06 02:28:00,7971,"One thing to check out as well is used motors that do not work....you can sometimes get them really cheap....if one has a working trim and tilt, then you may get yourself a bargain!  If you could find your own motor, then you'd have spare parts as well."
130460,2 tone z71,2007-11-06 13:38:00,1311,"I would do as Cliff suggested find a complete motor the same  only with TNT ,its more than just adding in the unit which is a big job on its own,removing engine spreading the bracket open or possibly removing the bracket and replacing with the TNT unit,theres also the wiring and relays that need some thought ,also the controls with switch on handle IMO its not worth it ,your better off selling what ya have and buying a motor ready to go"
