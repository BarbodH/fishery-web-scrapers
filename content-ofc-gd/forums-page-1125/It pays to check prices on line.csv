So on the way to go see my Bro this morning, may as well stop in at BPro and pick one up if they're in stock.  Go to see the electronics display, just about needed a wheelchair after what I saw, same item here...$239.99. Asked the dude at the counter, you sure, he just smiled. Okay, looks like Cabela's will get my order.  Even with shipping and G/PST, it will keep close to $100 in my pocket, or maybe a little gift for the wife."
