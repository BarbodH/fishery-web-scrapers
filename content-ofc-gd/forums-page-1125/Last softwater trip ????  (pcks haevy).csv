130043,keram,2007-11-05 00:57:00,585,"It was planed that it will be my last softwater ""challenge"" this year. First time I've went to Scugog just to ""burn"" some leftover gas mix . Sunrise   Well, what do you know . In 2.5 hrs on the water I've landed 4 skies, nothing huge, but pretty decent size. Shortly after I've reached my secret spot (thanks Cliff - ccmtcanada, for a tip  ), I've started drifting slowly with jig+plastic leech. Five min in huge hit  , and shortly later this chunky scrapper (37"") was posing for the picture    Catching breath at the boat side    And see you next time    About ten min later on the same jig I've hooked this ""hungry beast"" (39"")  Couple action shots       Quick foto    And see you later    Then an action died down for about an hour. When I was having breakfest  I was interruptad again, with force (40""). Half hr later another (38"") No picture of this fish because I've left camera in cold  (instead in the pocked) and the battery refused to cooperate.  In the afternoon I planed to winterize my boat, but after day like this it has to be postponed  . One more weekend left  So, instead Itook family (dog included) and we went to check wheather wild mushrooms still growing. Well, the do  Ready for drying    And supper    It was very productive day"
