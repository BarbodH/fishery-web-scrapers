Never forget the simplicity in life... not only did we see it in Liam's enjoyment but we heard it in your laughter... That my friend is PURE JOY!  Not something you can plan or buy, just something that happens when one is taken by a moment.  What a beautiful moment in your life to share... Thank you for reminding all of us what being a parent and letting the simple things just happen.  Cheers,  Jen"

My son is gonna be 17 soon and we still spend most of our time together, but now that he's older, we get to go quading, fishing, hunting, geocaching and almost everything else outdoors."
