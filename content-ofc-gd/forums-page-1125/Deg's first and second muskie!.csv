130071,Dano,2007-11-05 02:02:00,719,"Nice fish Deg! Congratulations. Fun, arent they?"
130075,Jigger,2007-11-05 02:11:00,1237,"Congrats on the first and 2nd 'skis! That one in the pic is real purdy! Looks like you were fishing fairly close to shore, what depth did you get her out of? How about water temps?"
129611,SlowPoke,2007-11-03 21:55:00,2984,"Hooked up with Don (Deg) today for breakfast in London. I just happened to have my boat/gear with me and Don just happened to have his gear with him so we went for a drive.  Before we know it, we're floating around washing lures. It was a slow start for everyone around us and I don't think we saw the first fish caught until 9ish. After that it was fairly steady.  We had no luck until Don put on one of ""bricknblocks"" inlines and the reel started to sing. It wasn't a big fish but it started with ""M"" and rhymed with husky. A fairly short tussle and it was in the net. A bit of a belly on this one I would estimate around 36"" and it was certainly fiesty in the net at boatside. Don removed the hook but the lure was still tangled in the net when the fish tried to make a break for it. It was half out of the net and Don let it go so it didn't carve itself up on the lure. Sorry, no pictures of Don's first muskie but we felt better knowing it swam away clean and healthy.  It wasn't too long afterwards that we would get the kodak moment.  Don's rod begins to sing and this one felt a lot better. A good fighter but we didn't know how big until it was near the boat.  Tease....      Into the net and a smile for the camara    A very healthy looking 45""er!  A great day on the water with Don, outstanding weather and a heck of a lot more fun than yardwork!  We'll do it again Don, I have to even the score! -Brian"
129613,TennesseeGuy,2007-11-03 22:01:00,957,Nice fish guys.  Way to go Don.

If it'll make you feel any better I was out with BricknBlock yesterday chasing after some muskie.  2 small muskies for me and none for BnB, he did have a follow though.  (However, I had 3 follows   )  BricknBlock does make some awesome baits.  Glad they worked out for you 2 yesterday."
