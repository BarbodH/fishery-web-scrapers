I actually went last weekend too but didn't get chance to post a report.  Here's how I did on both trips...  Last weekend...  Went out on the Saturday for a few hours to see if I could hook into some late season bass or a nice pike.  The weeds have died right back and few fish were to be seen cruising the shorelines or docks.  The weather wasn't great either so I wasn't too optimistic until I got to one of my favourite spots and saw a few dark bass-like shapes hanging around some structure.  It wasn't long before I managed to get a bite but somehow didn't get a good hookset and the fish was lost.     I tried again, hoping that I hadn't spooked the fish.  Five mins later I have a second bite, I strike but manage to pull the bait right out of the bass' mouth.     I tried again and bang third time lucky I managed to bring in a nice 2.5lb largemouth.     Not quite the big bass I was looking for but not bad for this time of year.  I then tried casting lures for pike but didn't get any follows or hits, so called it a day.       This weekend...  Headed out to the Islands for a few hours Saturday afternoon.  My wife decided to come with me for the walk and the fresh air - it was nice to have the company out there but I knew it would mean a short time fishing - she has no patience!   We started out fishing an area I knew often held 'panfish' late in the year.  The aim was to avoid the dreaded skunk.  It was great fun fishing with a float and worm and seeing the float go under every few minutes.  Caught about half a dozen pumpkinseed sunfish and a tiny largemouth bass before moving on.  The bass had great patterns on it but was somewhat smaller than the hawgs I have been catching recently on float and worm tactics at the islands - could this really be my last bass ever?!  Not quite the end to my Canadian fishing experience I had hoped for - perhaps this means I will have to get out and try one more time to catch the 'big one' before I go back to England.  I moved on to my favourite bass spot but there were no fish to be found.  Even fishing deep water for pike with xraps failed, so it was time to go and make the long walk back to the Wards Island ferry.  As I went I took a few parting shots of the islands for you all to enjoy.                 Hopefully I will get one more fishing trip in this year to share with you all.  Cheers 007"

130089,tdotfisherman,2007-11-05 02:34:00,317,"007, nice pictures and reports from the islands.. I went fishing Wards Island for the first time this past Thursday and there was nothing going down at all.. healthy weed growth was pretty much non-existent, no fish swimming around, and no bites what so ever.. oh well.."
130094,Kerry,2007-11-05 02:39:00,383,"007, I sure hope you send some pics from back home fishin' cause you've told quite a good story over the season here.Good luck on your future endeavours. Kerry"
130099,Mike the Pike,2007-11-05 02:50:00,3421,Can always count on you to take nice pics.When do you have to go back to the UK and will you be back next year?  MTP
130109,007,2007-11-05 03:18:00,537,"MTP - Flight is booked for mid December.  One-way ticket unfortunately - I'm moving back home for work and family reasons.  No plans on being back next year, though I will get a lot more vacation time so who knows I might get back someday for a bass fishin' holiday!  007"
130115,kickingfrog,2007-11-05 03:38:00,8333,"This is the world wide web so there is no reason to stop the reports, although I understand that public water is harder to come by in the UK."
130199,tbayboy,2007-11-05 15:24:00,1497,"Mid December - that what, 40 days from now? So then I only think its fair to expect 40 more reports before you head back.  Then we'll have to wait for for the UK carp action updates I guess"
130202,fishindevil,2007-11-05 15:31:00,6254,"Nice report & pics too !!!!thats a great catch of fish considering the way the weather has been the last few weekends ,thats too bad it might be your last fishing trip,before you head home...good-luck on your future fishing endevours,and maybe we will see you back on-line before long with a fishing report & trip from england....cheers"
