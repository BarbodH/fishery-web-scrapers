130013,Tarzan's Jane,2007-11-04 23:50:00,1183,I just wanted to say thanks.  I read this earlier today and it had a profound affect on me.  I was in a dark place...I took control of it...took responsibility for what I owned and I paid a visit to people that I have been hurting.  Anyway...I have learnt to not share too too much out in the open and that I need to pay attention to my own heart and fix what I can while I still can.
