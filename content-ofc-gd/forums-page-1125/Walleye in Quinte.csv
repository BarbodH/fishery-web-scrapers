130181,bbog,2007-11-05 14:56:00,665,"Invited by a friend to go Walleye or Perch fishing yesterday. Haven't had a shot at Walleye since the beginning of the year so opted for the longer trip to Quinte. Spend most of the day hiding under the cover from a little rain and washing lures.  The day however was PERFECT as I got into a personal best 31"" 10.5lb wally.  A few boats were out but we didn't see much action. Upon returning I chatted with a visitor from NY that managed to find a dozen Sheephead - but no Walleye. Anyway here is the picture of the happy angler.    Thanks for reading - hope everyone had a great weekend.  Barnie"

130207,superdad,2007-11-05 15:39:00,353,"PB""s are always good, the fish certainly aren't jumping in the boat.  The fishing appears spotty.  Stay Tuned."

130260,Badger Shark,2007-11-05 18:20:00,291,"Pretty sure we saw you out there yesterday.  Thats a nice fish.  It was a tough day for sure.  We ended up with 2 eyes and 2 big sheephead.  There were a few guys who caught about 5 eyes but they were fishing really deep. We were marking lots of fish but deep, ( bottom up to 40ft )  Did you guys get caught in that 20 min. hailstorm?  We were near Thomsons point and it started and didnt stop for at least 20 min.  Man we had everything from glass calm, warm, sun then to the hail storm and cold.  Then when we were on our way in we see a huge array of blue flashing lights off in the distance as it is now dark.  It was the OPP doing checks on the boats out there. We waited our turn and finally they headed over and checked us.  Man what a nice boat these guys have!  Count down to next Sunday is on, see ya out there!"
130272,huntervasili,2007-11-05 20:31:00,1604,"Nice PB... and them sheepies wouldn't stay off the damned hook, when we were there... only managed one 'eye, of about 5 or 6 lbs... ohh well Congrats again on the PB"
130370,POLLIWOGG,2007-11-06 01:18:00,835,Thats their  brand new police boat.  Some of those marks might be whitefish.
130417,bassmastermike,2007-11-06 06:26:00,295,WTG Great looking fish !!! Come on BOQ!!!!!
130431,b2kptbo,2007-11-06 11:14:00,1505,"Thats a beauty, congrats..."
130456,007,2007-11-06 13:23:00,537,Congratulations on the PB Walleye.  007
130502,bbog,2007-11-06 15:34:00,665, Yes the weather was crazy out there - was hoping for a little more breeze and overcast. We did not get the hail you mentioned nor the police inspection. Spent most of our time over towards the ferry.  Thanks to everyone for their kind words - can't wait to get into a BIGGER PB!
