129554,outdoorguy61,2007-11-03 14:33:00,220,"Thanks for posting this. It was a comical photo.  I had my face painted to look like a fish one Halloween, when I used to do an outdoors column in Eastern Ontario, in Kingston. The job was amazing, with the only photo taken could never be found. I had scales and texture, and would describe it as a ""McFish"", given that one could not tell if it was a coldwater or warmwater species.  outdoorguy61"
