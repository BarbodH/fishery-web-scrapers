129758,mattyk,2007-11-04 11:32:00,2110,thanks for sharing!
129759,Terry,2007-11-04 11:49:00,14456,looks like you had a great day on the water
129790,Rich Clemens,2007-11-04 13:17:00,3131,"Too dang bad I live so far away, would love to be a part of some of these offers and the action.  Sounds like ya all had a great time anyway.  Thanks for sharing and the pics ... pretty cool."
129791,irishfield,2007-11-04 13:18:00,26272,Rich...make it an overnight trip..we've got lots of beds with the kids off at University.
129799,Rich Clemens,2007-11-04 13:27:00,3131,MUST .......... RESIST  ........... TEMPTATION.       NAH        (That would be great)
129804,glen,2007-11-04 13:39:00,2641,Wayne thank you very much for the great day on the water.  For November the weather was perfect.
129805,irishfield,2007-11-04 13:41:00,26272,Get that CO's anal lube off your floater suit yet?
129812,mikeh,2007-11-04 13:54:00,824,"Sure looked like a great day to be out there. I have met that CO twice this year, the last time he was with a young female OPP officer and I kind of thought he was showing off a little as he did most of the talking, I guess thats just his personality. Good to see them out checking boats though."
129815,glen,2007-11-04 14:02:00,2641,Yes and i found a better use.
129819,irishfield,2007-11-04 14:09:00,26272,"I too am glad to see them out there Mikeh and have no issues with being pulled over...just wished it had been before we had my way point lined up or after we'd been long over it. In the time it took the CO to lecture Glen...about something that is absolutely legal to do by the way.... he could have been out tracking down one of the lake's poachers.  This CO's ""interpretation"" is that you are ""in possession"" of a fish by taking a picture of it and unless you are going to jump into the water to have a picture taken he will charge you holding up a Muskie on a Conservation licence. This would be no different than charging a bass tournement guy for catching his 7th fish of the day, a pickeral fisherman netting, taking a picture and releasing his 5th or 7th pickeral on a given lake etc...that had a full sport licence... or the guy with a sport licence that caught his 2nd Muskie of the day and took a picture. Guess I broke the law 4 times back on Wednesday and thank God lew only caught one or he'd be goin to court with me ! You guys fishing sturgeon with a ZERO possession limit had better stop taking pictures all together!  Glen..."
129824,lew,2007-11-04 14:18:00,12767," Your just gonna keep rubbing that in, aren't you Wayne ??   ....over & over & over &.......    "
129825,bucktail,2007-11-04 14:20:00,1857,Nice report.  Were there any herring in beside Thompson yet? A  bonus day when you can find new areas for a milk run. I also wonder why we have license numbres on the boat if they dont mean anything anymore????????  D
129827,glen,2007-11-04 14:21:00,2641,I am going to be busy for the rest of today i have to take all of my muskie pics down off the wall.  I guess i will do all of the other fish too just to be safe.
129832,irishfield,2007-11-04 14:27:00,26272," LOL Lew !  Graham said it best on Raf's site..  Fishing boat and truck - $120,000  Gas from Midland to Port Perry - $100  Bumblebee Believer - $20  Outfishing Lew 5-1 on a Kawartha Lake - PRICELESS  I'm sure it will never happen again and like we both say..who cares...fish are a bonus..the day is what you make of it and we BOTH had a great time."
129833,irishfield,2007-11-04 14:29:00,26272,Darren..the only real bait schools we marked..and they may have been perch or a stack of small 'eyes..was in Midland Harbour..half way between the coal dock and the midland shoal marker. We were not up by Thompson ... think east and Mooo!
129844,fishnsled,2007-11-04 14:54:00,3520,"Great report Wayne, a beauty of a day to be on the water in November.  Lew - Revenge is sweet.  Mind you that day on the bog will be tough to beat! Good luck!"
129878,kickingfrog,2007-11-04 16:40:00,8333,"Be careful of what you ask for. Would this co prefer someone have a full licence, then go out and catch, keep and eat one musky each day of the season where permitted? That is ""legal"", but almost definitely bad for the fishery (not to mention almost impossible to do).   Rob"
129883,irishfield,2007-11-04 16:57:00,26272,"He always adds he is ""protecting the waters of Georgian Bay that surely hold a world record Muskie and thinks it's strange that someone with over $1000 in Muskie gear would skimp out to save the $15 difference on a licence......what would you do if you caught the world record?"". I always say I'd let it go like all the others....and the conservation licence made that a really easy choice to protect our fishery! Then he says ""what if it dies on you while taking the picture"" ...well it becomes turtle food like any of the many ""successful"" C and R releases that die afterwards. Life goes on...one day I'm gonna hand this guy one of the 5 copies of a letter that I have in the glove box on the boat...that states the MNR wouldn't even think of laying charges for taking a QUICK picture of an OOS fish...otherwise they'd have to start doing the same to the guy that is taking a picture of his 7th and 8th Walleye of the day...Oh and the letter is from the MNR office in North Bay!"
129891,Guest gbfisher,2007-11-04 17:10:00,0, The Area towards the river is LOADED as it is every year at this time. Jumpin all over the place. Its funny to see the faces of people who don't realize they are there as they take your lures for a run or two as you pass through the schools.....  Yup gotta love being guilty before you are proven innocent  Wayne...  Good day out on the mill pond....lol
129754,lew,2007-11-04 09:39:00,12767,"Great fishing report Wayne, even without the fish !! Beautiful scenery shots too  Keep working on that big girl on the hump, your day is coming bud !!   Your right about some of the rules though Wayne, some of them are good, but others don't always seem to make alot of sense sometimes.  Same thing as requiring a flashlight in your boat at noon when you NEVER fish at night.  And requiring a fire extinguisher in a boat with a built-in gas tank, but not for a boat with a portable gas tank. Guess the rulemakers figure 5 gallons of flaming gas in your boat isn't a problem  And you can drive a 40' cabin cruiser WITHOUT a license, but you NEED a license when you hop in the 8' dingy with a 5 hp to go to shore   Strange stuff.....very strange indeed....."
129757,Shelley Cooper,2007-11-04 11:28:00,394,"Looks like you had beauty weather for your outing.. as you said, Fish is a bonus.. glad to see you got out...  Also, thank you for this thread.. We had no idea we had to carry the ownership for the boat, IN THE BOAT... We'd carry it in the truck because of pulling the boat, but not in the boat itself....thank god we haven't been stopped on the water...We'll be sure to put a copy in the boat now...  Thank you for sharing...."
