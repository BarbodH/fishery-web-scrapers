129918,Jonny Rebel,2007-11-04 18:41:00,11,"Funny thing i sold my Springbok deep v and picked this one up from a guy out side of Welland. I had met and see the Four kings 21' islander  and said i would get 1 . 12 foot swells and never dipped the front  , the best great lakes boats!"
129983,bassfighter,2007-11-04 22:25:00,366,"Nice boat.  Make sure the engine is protected from robbery. My friend 40hp FI new yamaha was stolen off his driveway during christmas one night, and was surprise that he did not hear anything the night before. How they did it still buffled us  Just an advice, no intention to scare you."
129986,irishfield,2007-11-04 22:28:00,26272,It'll take them a little while on the inboard/outboard...but I've seen it done.. IN THE WATER on Georgian Bay. (drive unit removed and boat sunk at dock!)
