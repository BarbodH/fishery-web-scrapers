He used it mainly on the back of a canoe, but also ona dingy.  I was thinking of taking it off his hands an use it on my 14' fiberglass as a trolling motor (I doa fair bit of trolling for both lakers up northh and salmon on Lake O when the lake is flat enough for my small craft! I figure the boat is roughly 500-600lb (not including persons, or gear).  My question is do you think that little 2hp would be adequate to troll with?  Thanks!  Poacher"
134029,fishindevil,2007-11-16 00:09:00,6254,"Well i would think so...my 16ft tracker had a 4hp kicker and it was ok,with power to spare,it was perfect as you could barely hear it run...so i would think a 2hp would do it ok for trolling,maybe not on lake ontario especially if you are trolling into a stiff wind,but i think you are just going to have to try it out right??? but i still think so my tracker weighed almost 1000lbs and the 4 did it no prob,so try her out good-luck and let us know how you made out so if anyone else has a small kicker we would know...cheers"
134065,ilario11,2007-11-16 02:39:00,41,thanks buddy...i'll let ya know if I end up getting it..  poacher
134098,brickNblock,2007-11-16 11:01:00,598,"we have the same motor, Honda 2hp4stk........... justpurrs and moves our aluminum along fine with 2ppl and gear.......for small lakes. I wouldnt even consider the big lake or even the bOQ with it tho........AT ALL !!!!! (if it was your only source of power)"
134105,solopaddler,2007-11-16 12:25:00,8605,"I've got the same motor. Mainly use it on my 16' squareback, but I have used it on a 14' boat and it worked just fine. Great for trolling! If you can get it for a good price I'd grab it. Those little 2hp motors are nice to have for a lot of different uses..  cheers"
134108,lew,2007-11-16 12:57:00,12767,"The only thing I might be concerned with,  would a 2 hp be strong enough to turn your boat on a windy day ?? Your saying 5-600 pounds plus people and gear, that could add up pretty quick.  I had a 6 hp on my 16' Crestliner and it was tough to turn into a strong crosswind sometimes.  Just something to think about"
134209,ilario11,2007-11-16 22:55:00,41,"  Thanks guys... they are great little motors. I had the 9.9 and it was fantastic..So quiet and smooth. I think Honda makes the best motor out there(not unlike the cars)  I appreciate the advice. I would NOT use this as a principle motor ona  large body of water. I would use it as a kicker for trolling on clam, windless mornings, which is when I do 80% of my trolling. Based on your input, I can surmise that you all think it would probably be ok on a 14 or 15' boat - as long as a gale is blowing!  I can get this puppy for a good deal so I think it would be a nice motor to have regardless.. It would come in handy on a bak lake on a canoe or samll tin boat too..  I'll let ya know how i make out  Poacher"
