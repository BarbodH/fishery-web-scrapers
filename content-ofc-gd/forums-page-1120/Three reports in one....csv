134021,The Urban Fisherman,2007-11-15 23:25:00,2050,"Well a few weeks ago I had to get out of the computer room so I decided to take my 1 year old out and teach her a few things.  I know I know, she's still pretty young but you have to start somewhere.  The small reservoir I sometimes fish has completely turned over.  The weeds are LONG gone and I suspect that most of the bass had moved into deeper water.  But it was a nice morning and a good day to test out everything we had.  There's also a chance at a rainbow.....  I had to talk Averie out of tresspassing...she insisted that if we fished here we'd catch'em...maybe I should have listened to her!   We started off with Lesson#1, the Baitcaster... We tossed everything under the sun and NOTHING...   So we went a little lighter and I showed her a few things with the Ultralight..she watched patiently...but, NOTHING...   Alright so we just want SOMETHING, time to switch over to noodle rod with a float and worm...wouldn't you belive it...nevermind catching a rainbow, we can't even manage a SUNFISH....   So, the day turns out to be a bust, Averie only got to take home a leaf, but it was still time well spent.    Alright, so after having such a bad outing with my daughter, I had to get on some fish.  So, I hit my favourite carp spot hoping for a full morning of late season carp action.  The water is shallow and clear, so I usually chum the area and toss around a lure or two until I see the carp moving in.  Well, the cold weather must have SLOOOOOWED them big old carp right down because they just weren't coming in very fast.  While I waited I tossed around a small spinnerbait on my ultralight.  Sure enough I managed this tiny little hammer-handle first cast.  Second smallest pike I've ever caught...haha   Next up, a Wee-Largemouth   And Finally, not a giant by any means, but this guy put up a good tussle in the ultralight with 6lb line. To bad the picture didn't turn out so well.   Then I spotted a couple of carp moving in, so I witched set-ups and fished for over an hour before this little guy decided to eat up my corn.  He bled a little but swam off fine!   After that - nothing for a while until my first and only catfish of 2007 -and my last fish of the morning.   So, nothing of any size, but not bad for a couple of hours fishing Big Creek, 5 minutes from my doorstep!  NOW - my last report,  I started ""steelheading"" or at least trying to be a steelheader last fall on the credit and just when I was getting used to the area I moved.  So, I'm now fishing Lower Big Creek, a Trib of Lake Erie in hopes of actually landing my first ever bonified steelhead.  Trout ponds don't really count.  The day started off with a nice dusk and sunrise....  My Backyard   And the side of the road on my way to the creek.   Finally prime Steelhead water?????   How about here???   And the all to common site when I'm steelheading....my float - Not going down...   And Finally - I'm pretty sure this girl was laughing at me from affar the entire morning!    Long story short, I've tried many baits, depths and locations on the creek so far and have come up short each time.  But, I can't complain about the scenery, and hopefully once we get a little more rain...or snow the creek will come up a little and the steelhead will start moving in......  Good luck to everyone hitting Quinte this weekend!  Cheers, UF"

134069,snag,2007-11-16 03:09:00,1932,"Great report!  It's hard enough to catch a fish this time of year solo, not to mention a baby on your chest!  (Been there,  you become very aware of hooks!)  Your daughter really is a cutie.  Thanks!"

134085,The Urban Fisherman,2007-11-16 04:30:00,2050,"Thanks for all the kind words guys!!!!!!!  fishindevil - I'm bound to hook into some steel soon....  Maureen - She has to figure out the whole ""talking"" thing first... although once she starts i'm afraid she won't stop! heh  Roy - her being a head turner is what I'm afraid of! haha  Take her mom for example...she's a head turner and all she got was ME!  Cliff - I do get out from time to time....I need a boat soon though - glad to see you and Bly have one now!  Snag - what, no witty comment? dude you're slippin'! haha thanks man....keep up the entertaining TO reports!  Camillj - yepp, the pix with Averie are way better than any pix of me holding a fish....although I wouldn't be opposed to having some of me and her WITH a fish!  Thanks again all - good luck out there.  Cheers, UF"
