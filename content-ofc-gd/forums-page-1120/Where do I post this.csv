I found out we can camp right at the track,so Im looking for a truck cap for my F150 or one of those campers that fit on the back. I would even concider renting someones tent trailer if you have one to offer up."
134160,Raf,2007-11-16 18:20:00,3495,two birds with one stone bud!!  
134162,misfish,2007-11-16 18:23:00,29133,LMAO  Not sure the wife would go for that. Im lucky she has agred to sleep in the back of the truck. LOL
134167,Beans,2007-11-16 18:50:00,3339,The hotels/motels don't miss out on a good thing during race weeks...prices double plus...  We had good luck fishing off the pier in Daytona...no license required and if you use your own tackle all you pay is admission and a couple of bucks for some frozen shrimp...Great fun !  Watch out for the sneaky birds...they'll steal your bait !!!
134184,Whopper,2007-11-16 20:05:00,2174,"Beans is right on with fishing off the pier, but go to the south one Sunglow not the Main Street pier, personally I think the fishing is better at Sunglow and a little safer too!"
134186,misfish,2007-11-16 20:16:00,29133,"Sound like I,ll be eating not the fish.LOL   Ok please explain??????????"
134206,highdrifter,2007-11-16 22:18:00,2534,"Hey Brian!  Long time budday..  Do you have an Airmiles account??  If you're looking for hotel accomadions, ! may be able to help ya out!  cheers HD"
134229,Whopper,2007-11-17 02:47:00,2174," The Main Street pier is down at the boardwalk, and scammers and undesireables hang out down there (I'm trying to be polite here   ) Parking a vehicle is at risk. A lot more traffic up there also. I like the Sunglow, been going there for years and I see some of the same ""good old boys"" that kinda of police their pier. I think the last time I was there it was $6.00 for a 24hr pass or I used to buy a 7day $25 pass plus your bait. You can buy the bait on the pier or save a little bit and buy from a bait shop not a couple hundred yards from the pier (have to pass it on your way in)."
