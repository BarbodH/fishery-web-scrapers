Just thought I'd share.  ""Attention Canadian Citizens Travelling to the US by Land or Water""  As of JANUARY 31, 2008, if you travel to the US by land or water, a US law will require you to present:  - A government issued photo ID (i.e. driver's license); AND - A birth certificate or a citizenship card  OR  - For youth under 16, a birth certificate  OR  - A valid passport  No word on what would be required before January 31, 2008, but I would still use one of the above."

We usually have our birth certificates in hand as we give them our driver lic., very rarely do they wanna see the birth cert...."
