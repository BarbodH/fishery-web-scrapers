I finally got out myself for a little bit of fun this past Monday. The conditions were no longer as good as they had been on the weekend, but I still managed a good bunch of steelhead. Here are just a few.          Thunderball!!! This guy leapt about 5 times before I finally got him in.    The next two pics are from the same fish. I couldn't believe the dimensions... very short for the width and weight of her. She still put up a heck of a bullish fight. Took a good 10 minutes to get her to shore.        And finally, the one that didn't get away...    Yummmmmy!  Cheers, p.-"
