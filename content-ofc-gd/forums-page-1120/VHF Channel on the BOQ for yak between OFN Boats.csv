133526,BITEME,2007-11-14 12:41:00,1969,stay on 16 and if you need to chat tell person to go 72  Just my opinion  if you are in trouble you want that to go out on 16  EMERGENCIES  VHF 16 CELL PHONE   *16
133528,Roy,2007-11-14 12:48:00,13728,"Well said, Peter."
133529,lew,2007-11-14 12:49:00,12767,"  Peter, who do you get when you dial *16 on a cell, is it the OPP ??"
133531,BITEME,2007-11-14 13:02:00,1969, *16=Prescot Coast Gaurd(emergencies only)
133532,lew,2007-11-14 13:10:00,12767,"Thanks Pete, would *16 be good for water emergencies EVERYWHERE in Ontario ??"
133533,BITEME,2007-11-14 13:13:00,1969,"When your radio is on, always listen to Channel 16. This is the safety and calling channel. Use low power to call whenever practical. VHF radio range may be up to 80 miles in good conditions and everyone in that range can hear you! High power does not get more distance; it allows a strong signal so you have a better chance of being heard at a greater distance. Prearrange to call at a specific time on a working channel; you don't have to use Channels 16. To transmit, depress the microphone button, speak directly into the microphone without touching it, then release the button as soon as you have finished. Do not shout! Keep communication brief. VHF is for marine safety. If you like to chat, consider using a cellular telephone. Do not ask for a radio check on Channel 16. Call a specific radio station and move to a working channel to ask for a check. A signal of full strength and with full readability is known as a ""5 by 5"" signal. ""2 by 5"" is weak but very clear signal. The second number measures the readability of the signal. Bad (Unreadable) Poor (Readable now and then) Fair(Readable with great difficulty) Good (Readable with minor difficulty) Excellent (Perfectly readable) If you have children aboard, educate them not to use the marine radio except in emergencies. People's lives often depend on a clear channel. Post an emergency MAYDAY form for guests or children to call for help in an emergency. It is a criminal offence to call a false MAYDAY. If you are out of fuel but in no danger, anchor and call a marina or towing service. It is an offense to broadcast profanity. To identify the name of your vessel or its call-sign, use Phonetic Alphabet to say letters. For example, when you say a call-sign, instead of saying ""VX 1984"", you would say, ""Victor X-ray One Niner Aayt Fo-wer"".

133534,BITEME,2007-11-14 13:14:00,1969,  16 is good anywhere in Canada and the US its just a matter of how close the nearest rescue unit is
133535,lew,2007-11-14 13:16:00,12767,"Thanks Pete, lotsa good stuff there"
133650,fishindevil,2007-11-14 20:06:00,6254,"Well like peter said,i always stay on 16 till you call another party then pick out of several channels to talk on ...so check the list and go from there,thanks peter,saves alot of typing...DO NOT HOLD CONVERSATIONS ON CHANNEL 16 AS PRESCOTT WILL GIVE YOU TROUBLE,ITS A CALL CHANNEL,AND EMERGENCY CHANNEL ONLY..."
133657,LeXXington,2007-11-14 21:31:00,1928,"Ok, so 72 for OFC.  (most VHF have the ability to monitor 2+ channels.) 16 is there by default on my Scan.  7/24 for handled."
133660,fishindevil,2007-11-14 21:38:00,6254,Yes we can do ch.72...most people i think will hang on 16 then go to 72 when called....we can also go 06 too depends on how clear the channel is....
133670,Gerritt,2007-11-14 22:34:00,6129,Dangit I need to get a VHF radio!... not to chat it up per say but as a safety tool. I will have one before I launch the boat next spring.  will anyone be bringing up hand held FRS radios? Mine are fairly decent...22km range.  For those of us without VHF perhaps we can establish a channel as well.  G.
134000,Gerritt,2007-11-15 22:04:00,6129,bump!
