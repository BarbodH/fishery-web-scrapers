133771,icefisherman,2007-11-15 03:37:00,952,"Here is what I just found:  http://www.basspro.com/webapp/wcs/stores/s...mp;cmid=PP_P1_1  Does anyone know if this is a good radio, will it perform well with the 8' antenna and is it a good deal for US119.98 ??  Wonder what it'll cost here in the Canadian Bass Pro? Someone was asking for a VHF in another post. Maybe this could work for them too.  Cheers, Ice Fisherman"
133775,Dondorfish,2007-11-15 03:44:00,1000,yup - i think that is a pretty good deal - go with the 8 foot antenna if you can. I think I paid close to $80 here just for the antenna and mount!   Don
133777,icefisherman,2007-11-15 03:46:00,952,"Before I order it from the US, does anyone know if the same deal is available here in the store in Vaughan Mills?  Cheers, Ice Fisherman"
133778,Dondorfish,2007-11-15 03:48:00,1000,Highly doubt it! That radio will probably be in the $150 - $180 range here PLUS the antenna and last I checked - they sell the rachet base seperately - but check it out and let us know.   Don
133781,irishfield,2007-11-15 03:49:00,26272,Doubtful !!! Call them in the am.
133783,icefisherman,2007-11-15 03:52:00,952,"  Will do and let you know. Any idea what I'll be charged in shipping/duties/taxes if ordered from the US?  Cheers, Ice Fisherman"
133785,irishfield,2007-11-15 03:54:00,26272,Shipping will be stated right on BPS's website when you check out. What it won't show you is the 14% tax at the border and if the radio is made offshore...like it most likely is...there is import duty as well...somewhere between 5 and 8.5%.
133787,Dondorfish,2007-11-15 03:55:00,1000,Have you also checked cabelas?   http://www.cabelas.com/cabelas/en/template...entId=cat602025   Don
133790,icefisherman,2007-11-15 04:01:00,952," Don, I did look at Cabelas but seems like the BPS deal is a better one. You can get similar radio from Cabelas for $99 and add 3' antenna for only $19.99 so total is about the same as BPS but I preffer the 8' antenna and you can not get it cheap at Cabelas. By the time you add 8' antenna from them total price goes way up. And you are right I've been checking on those antennas for a while and they normally are $70-$80 each. So this seems a good deal as long as this radio is decent quality?  Cheers, Ice Fisherman"
133791,Dondorfish,2007-11-15 04:05:00,1000,"I see that now - just saw the page as I was flipping through it and thought I would post it - I have 3 radios already - so I didn't even look at the prices. Don't think for that price, you can go to far wrong. It is a basic radio, has the emergency features and has 1 watt low and 25 watt high output - should be all you'll ever need.   Don"
133815,JohnF,2007-11-15 06:48:00,3494, How does BPS ship cross border orders? I used to get dive gear sent up and sometimes I'd get nailed for brokerage fees too.  JF
133887,icefisherman,2007-11-15 14:52:00,952,"Just to let everyone interested know. I called BPS in Vaughan Mills today. They off course don't have that radio in there so I ordered it from the US. Vey kind people and good customer service. Hope it is good radio.  Cheers, Ice Fisherman"
133905,BFSC Kevin,2007-11-15 15:32:00,1351,hmm.. thanks for the tip! i was looking into getting a VHF.. but waiting till i found a deal on one... but 8' long antenna?!?!?! seems really long......
133912,icefisherman,2007-11-15 15:51:00,952,"Kevin,  you've got a choice in antennas...you can get the 8' or the 3' one. I personally prefer the 8' for better reception but same deal applies if you want to go with the shorter antenna.  Cheers, Ice Fisherman"
