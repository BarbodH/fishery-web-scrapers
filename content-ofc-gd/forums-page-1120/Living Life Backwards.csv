Then, you wake up in a nursing home feeling better every day.  When you are kicked out of the home for being too healthy, you spend several years enjoying your retirement and collecting benefit checks.  When you start work, you get a gold watch on your first day.  You work 40 years or so, getting younger every day until pretty soon you're too young to work.  So then, you go to high school: play sports,date,drink, and party.  As you get even younger, you become a kid again! .  You go to elementary school, play, and have no responsibilities.  In a few years, you become a baby and everyone runs themselves ragged keeping you happy.  You spend your last 9 months floating peacefully in luxury, spa-like conditions: central heating, room service on tap.  Until finally...You finish off as an orgasm.  Priceless!"
