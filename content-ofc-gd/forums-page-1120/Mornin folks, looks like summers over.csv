This winter is supposed to be a ""typical"" Canadian winter if you believe the long term weather reports.  Steve; If you are still wearing shorts outside in this weather, those little balls of ice might not be sticking to the hair on your legs LOL."

Buck and I were out on the Colorado River, the water is pretty low, plenty of new sand bars...we didn't go faster than a troll. I hooked one Bass on a Rattlel-Trap, in one of the backwater lakes, but it came off on a jump. After reading these posts I put my hands in the freezer for a couple of minutes, so that I could imagine what the next few months will be like back home. I didn't like it...hahaha Garry2Rs"
