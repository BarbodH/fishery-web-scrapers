133727,Nanook,2007-11-15 01:35:00,565," I'm in the process of carving a Turtle [No, not practice for Christmas ]. I've got the shell, legs, scales, claws done,but I'm stumped on the belly portion [ Plastron ]. I've checked Libraries, Carving books,even contacted the ROM,   Nada !!!and its too late in the year to try and find a live one around here.  Would any of our Southern Brethren, have any Pic's of the underbelly,or could get one? If you can help, I would really appreciate it.  Please e-mail or PM if you can help.......and THANKS in advance!"

133731,Dabluz,2007-11-15 01:49:00,701,You could also take a trip to a pet shop and bring your camera with you.  I'm sure that one of the employees will hold on of the turtles for you to photograph.

I carve from Basswood mainly, cant afford the exotic woods.  Thanks to all for the replies, the turtle is finished now, just waiting for the painting now. THATS going to take a while. Cant paint worth a s***. LOL !!"

134110,Clausewitz,2007-11-16 13:05:00,19,"I've taken to collecting nice pieces of wood where I can.  A friend was putting in a hardwood floor that is a type of exotic ironwood that doesnt need stain to give it that beautiful red/brown and I snagged a piece of that.  A piece here, and a piece there gives a nice collection.  Looking forward to seeing the finished product, have you taken pics along the way to show the process?"
