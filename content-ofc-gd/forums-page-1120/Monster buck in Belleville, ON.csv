I thought I would post these pics for everyone to see.  This is the hunter that harvested this monster buck.   Here is a pic with Glen holding the monster.   One of our customer's is presently re-constructing our web site and we will have a taxidermy section on our site that will display some of our work.  This buck will definitely be on there when it is completed.  Best regards, Sam"

That will be done as soon as the rack is dried and I will also have two more racks of similar size and will post the pics on here as soon as they're available.
