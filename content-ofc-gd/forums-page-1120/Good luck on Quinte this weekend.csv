133891,lew,2007-11-15 15:00:00,12767,"Best of luck to everyone heading to Quinte for the g2g this weekend  We had some nasty winds for the inaugural November Quinte g2g a few years back, so hopefully the weather will co-operate with everybody a bit better this year.  Play safe, have fun and take pics.  A couple pics of the waves from our 1st OFC Quinte trip  Remember the big Triton bass boat that got swamped in the middle of the ferry channel on the Saturday afternoon with the 3 guys aboard??  ........That sure coulda turned out ALOT worse than it did !!

133894,BFSC Kevin,2007-11-15 15:07:00,1351,yikes.... i hope it wont be that bad... i would never go out like that.. yikes
133895,BFSC Kevin,2007-11-15 15:07:00,1351,Are you heading out too Lew?
133896,kentooley,2007-11-15 15:11:00,208,Sounds like a blast!!!  Wish I were going. Maybe next year.  Be safe.  Chris.
133898,JohnF,2007-11-15 15:20:00,3494," I second that, Lew.  And I gotta say I'm pretty envious too. It took me too long to figger out what the g2g thang was all about this year but I'm gonna do my best to make it next year. A warning before anyone offers to take me on board - I know zip about walleye fishing, or boat fishing at all for that matter, and most of my gear is sized to catch stuff about comparable to what you guys seem to be using for bait. The boat part I'm good with - but all those aerials sticking up? What's that about? I never see any real fishing rods on anything but tinnies.  JF"
