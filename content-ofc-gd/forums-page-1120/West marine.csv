133722,bassmastermike,2007-11-15 01:18:00,295,I love that place!!!
133739,tschirk,2007-11-15 02:12:00,261,Last month I went in there to buy a Garmin GPS60CSX and asked if they would match RadioWorlds price. The clerk called over the manager ( a lady who's name escapes me) and was indignantly told that they do not match prices with companies the likes of Radio World. I was blown away by her comment & attitude... Never again will I go there ( and I work near there at Bay/Wellington).  I am still stunned by her actions....
133741,irishfield,2007-11-15 02:20:00,26272,"We have one in Midland...I use it as an absoute last resort for parts that aren't readily available anywhere else when in a hurry. They cater to the yacht ""club"" and if you don't have a members card to collect points...well ya ain't .... !"
133745,Fisherman,2007-11-15 02:50:00,7201,I'm pretty sure that rod holder can be had for about $20 at CTC.
133747,irishfield,2007-11-15 02:53:00,26272,Not that cheap..bought it once in CTC and had the wife return it after I decided there was no where on my glass boat I wanted to drill the holes for it. I think it was $32.99 or something.... STILL CHEAPER than West Marine.
133839,BFSC Kevin,2007-11-15 13:07:00,1351,lol.. yeah.. no doubt.. i think i bought mine was bass pro for $26.. but then i needed 2 more for the upcoming boq meet.. but now looks like i don't need them.. maybe i'll go back and return it to save myself $18..
133849,lew,2007-11-15 13:25:00,12767,"I was in West Marine looking to buy an extension cable for a GPS, and when I asked the salesman about it, he just handed me a parts catalouge, told me to look it up myself,  walked away and continued talking to another salesman.  I went & put in a complaint to the store manager and asked if I woulda been treated the same way if I was purchasing a $5000 sonar for my yacht, then walked out.  Last I saw was the manager shaking his finger in the salesman's face."
133855,BFSC Kevin,2007-11-15 13:38:00,1351,Hmm.. i was talking to two of the salesman and they were very nice to me...lucky me?
133858,Roy,2007-11-15 13:39:00,13728,"Burns me too, Lew. Sometimes I think that the only reason some of those guys are there is that they don't know how to operate a spatula."
133861,BFSC Kevin,2007-11-15 13:56:00,1351,I guess a better example would be they have the Navionics GOLD sd xl9 great lakes and maritime chip for $199... even at bass pro it is $230 i think
133864,lew,2007-11-15 14:01:00,12767,"Kevin, how'd you make out with the LCX-25 from Cabellas ??"
133865,BFSC Kevin,2007-11-15 14:04:00,1351,"GOT IT! came in last friday.. i still have in the boxes though.. haven't installed it yet.. been just poking around with it... been preoccupied with school work and prepping other areas of the boat... it should be installed and ready for next week.. still 3-4 more good weeks of walleye atleast! then it'll be pack her up for the winter. Also grabbed a ram-mount for it.. probably will mount it something similar tothe way you have it, Lew. "
133870,lew,2007-11-15 14:14:00,12767,"Good stuff Kevin, you'll like that machine."
