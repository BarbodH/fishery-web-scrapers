133674,bigfish1965,2007-11-14 22:47:00,3382,I need to buy some 'bear' repellant...perhaps in this area one may encounter a 'bear'. My girlfriend likes to do some solo walks and meditation by the lake and I'd feel better if should could fend off a 'bear'. I found personal sized ones on the Cabela's site but don't know if customs would let it through. Anyone close to Niagara sell it?

133708,Terry,2007-11-15 00:29:00,14456,I bought my wife some from trombays  in Orillia  a few years ago I would think they still sell it and it is much stronger then the dog repellent
133710,danc,2007-11-15 00:31:00,4677,"Bear attractant I can help you with. Repellent, no."
133711,Roy,2007-11-15 00:38:00,13728,"Bear repellant doesn't work, Rick. Her best bet is to meditate with a friend who can't run as fast as her."
133713,danc,2007-11-15 00:40:00,4677, Good advice Roy. Works every time.
133716,bigfish1965,2007-11-15 00:45:00,3382,That would likely be me Roy..so I guess the repellent is for me...
133748,Corey,2007-11-15 02:57:00,355,You should be able to get some from Erie Tracker or Grimsby Tackle.  cd.
133754,Dozer,2007-11-15 03:09:00,896,Any camping store.  Get the one under pressure.  I've tested that stuff ( not on a bear ) and its awesome.

133788,irishfield,2007-11-15 03:56:00,26272,That might slow the rapist down...not sure though...
133848,cranks bait,2007-11-15 13:21:00,721,Try the Army Surplus stores as well.  It's amazing the stuff they'll have that no one else will.
133897,Bear,2007-11-15 15:20:00,106,I promise I'll leave her alone
133930,steverowbotham,2007-11-15 16:47:00,1800,Canadian Tire in Barrie sells it.  maybe the CTC down there ??
134004,Kirk,2007-11-15 22:19:00,347,Whats the difference between a bear # 1 thatt attacks a human without bear repellant and a bear #2 that attacks a human who carries bear repellant?  The shiit from the bear #2 smells like bear repellant.
