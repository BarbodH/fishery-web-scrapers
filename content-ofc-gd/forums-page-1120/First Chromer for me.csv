Tried  forsteel today even tho the condtions were low and and gin clear I finally managed to get one this year. I can't wait ill we get some decent rain and the temps drop. And as for the pic I blurred out the land because I know it bothers some people and don't want to start any negativity in the thread, if you don't like don't post. Thanks   "
