Hopes were up but after a while with nothing decided to move further down river.After a small detour( got lost,lol) we were at our next spot.We both had not been here for quite some time and after realizing the area had really changed we decided to go right to the lake for a look.Upon arriving in Port Maitland we saw this.    Not the greatest fishing conditions but gave it a try in a sheltered area.Here is a pic of Kennyman trying his luck.  With no luck here we went back to the last spot and found a spot to fish for a little while,again in vain.After that it was time to leave as I had to pick Ethan up from school.So we got skunked but was nice to get out again together and got to see the countryside.Maybe next time there will be pics of something that swims,lol."

134047,kentooley,2007-11-16 01:16:00,208,Always nice to get out....regardless of the #'s.  Chris.
134066,Rich,2007-11-16 02:51:00,3927,We hit up further yesterday and managed about 10 suckers thats about it. Nice to see a big steelhead caught at my favourite spot!

I guess we could have stayed in Caledonia, but you really need waders there to get in the middle and ahead of the current so you can hold the bait in the ""fish highway"". I need to put them on my Christmas list, with a new pole (mine got a little shorter a couple weeks ago). Had a good time anyway I guess. Good company anyway."
