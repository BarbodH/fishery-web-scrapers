133967,TJQ,2007-11-15 19:29:00,7806,I know some of you have seen this before.. but theres probably alot of newer users that haven't... I was dinking around with some new software and managed to get some older video done in hi-res...  If your a muskie fan... you'll LOVE this...  http://www.ontariofishingreels.com/hi-res/muskie1.avi (DivX)
133972,lew,2007-11-15 19:42:00,12767,"Can't get it to work TJ.  It begins to load, then there's just a bunch of flashing lights on the screen and it stops.  Oh well, if it's been around for awhile, I've probably seen it anyhoo"
133973,Headhunter,2007-11-15 19:44:00,5703,"Same here, read it as an audio file only, HH"
133975,TJQ,2007-11-15 19:48:00,7806,Hmmfff.....   ill try something else.... doh....  it worked for me...  ill do a windows media file.. that should be better...
133976,ccmtcanada,2007-11-15 19:51:00,7971,Wont load here either.  Rendering as .wmv will likely fix it.
133978,TJQ,2007-11-15 19:59:00,7806,OK OK....  Here....  http://www.ontariofishingreels.com/hi-res/muskie1.wmv  Hows that????  theres no audio on this one on purpose..
133980,ccmtcanada,2007-11-15 20:08:00,7971,Working fine now TJ!  It's a great video!!
134001,bigfish1965,2007-11-15 22:12:00,3382,First one worked fine for me..likely have the same codecs as you. I liked the first one. I'll see if I can figure out the codecs and find a download source...
134009,FishFinder,2007-11-15 22:40:00,481,"awesome video, too bad it didnt fight"
134010,JohnF,2007-11-15 22:40:00,3494, Try forcing it with Media Player. it worked for me although it was slow loading.  It's good.  JF
134011,bigfish1965,2007-11-15 22:46:00,3382,You'll need some modern avi or DivX codecs which you should have if you are running Windows Media Player 11. Otherwise a google search will give you places for them. Some codec packs give  false positives for trojans when using Norton AV
134040,Rizzo,2007-11-16 00:57:00,4754,CHOMP!
134044,mattyk,2007-11-16 01:04:00,2110,"real cool video, thanks for posting the link."
134049,Roy,2007-11-16 01:20:00,13728,First one worked fine for me too. But 40 seconds to bring it in is a long time at my age.
134200,highdrifter,2007-11-16 21:29:00,2534,kewl vid!  The first one worked cause I had me a codec downloading session the other day.  Looks like he robbed ya though..  Guess he was camera shy hehhheeh  cheers! HD  P.S.  Where'd those pike vids go??  Did ya manage to lick that leader issue?!
134201,TJQ,2007-11-16 21:37:00,7806, LOL... there was no hook on the minnow...  the last thing I wanted was the fish on the line...  they scare me.. Ive substituted the wire leader with 10 poiund test now... if they want the lure that bad.. welll.. they can have it.
134205,highdrifter,2007-11-16 22:10:00,2534," LOL!!  I thought that lunge looked a bit too satisfied...Aww yes, lure donations in the name of that ultimate take.... I guess suckers are cheaper than suiks.. heheh"
