Usually they are in the Detroit river, but I've picked them up from Lake Erie and Lake Huron before to. This is a blog post of a first hand experience of how easily and quickly things like this can happen.  Sorry if it's already been posted, but I thought should really link this.  I myself rarely wear a life vest, I always have them handy but just don't wear it.  I think I've put it on maybe 3 times, all three times when I was on Lake Erie.  I think I'm going to look into getting an inflatable soon though... mostly because of this story.  Link to Story"

Kinda like the last person you would think would get himself in a pickle like that."
