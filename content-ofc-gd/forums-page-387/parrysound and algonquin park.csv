713600,GreenCanada,2012-07-11 02:14:00,375,"If you check out google maps, just look for lakes that are beside Hwy 60. Lots of them are stocked with splake, which are pretty good eating and fight nicely as well. Once you see a lake that you might want to try just look up the stocking for the lake by searching google. It will give you an idea of which ones are more heavily stocked. You might get lucky with a few cruising the shoreline in the morning or evening, but during the day I find being on the water is best.  You will be hard pressed to find good spots from shore on a public forum, but just look on google maps for rivers close to hwy 60. I'm sure you'll hook into something!  Tight lines!"

713606,northernpike56,2012-07-11 02:32:00,717,exactly what green said. Stocking lists are valuble tools.
713803,Squid,2012-07-11 18:51:00,1656,Killbear provincial park is awesome. Blind bay campground is a great place to stay and there are plenty of shore fishing areas for Pike and Bass.
713863,Christopheraaron,2012-07-11 21:40:00,3525, Kilbear is OK but not if you want the experience (grouped sites).
