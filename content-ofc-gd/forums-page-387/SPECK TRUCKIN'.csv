713232,Moosebunk,2012-07-10 03:24:00,3970," Didn't go there man!  Did get some real tanks though!    Kinda get that with some folks.  There's a club you can join.    Just camped out.  Tonnes of sites to do so on the lake.    Yeah... me too.  Times 10-20 I hope in a couple weeks.    Looking forward to that... and with Crabby Colin too.   Thanks for the replies.  First attempt at video too, and really enjoyed putting it together.  StevieZ cracks me up with his ""BOOM"" every time."
713242,Cudz,2012-07-10 04:35:00,2652,I want to write something witty and cool here but I am kind of speechless. The quality of fish porn you post is just on another level.  Your vid was good too.  thanks for posting.  Makes me want to spend the whole summer there.

713659,BillM,2012-07-11 12:41:00,17367," Rainbow as in sky, not fish, lol."
713692,Moosebunk,2012-07-11 14:45:00,3970," Meeee too Cudz.  Now and again I'm checking Real Estate and job options out that way.  Wife wouldn't let it happen... but in maybe about 10 years the plan will be to have a trailer out that way and take on P/T summer work.    My oldest daughter loves that tune... and Rob Zombie's Dragula.  So it'll be a toss up, ""Specks on the Water"" versus ""Speckula.""  First Kesagami though for a little of the Cult's ""Pike Removal Machine.""    You truly are the one and only HighDrifter.  Inhaled that funny response with a huge belly laugh.    Don't be a stranger Shane... Nice hearing from ya.    My pleasure Mikey.  Let's get more of them this month.    A few more pics in the PBucket that didn't make it in.               Thanks for the kind replies gang."

714127,Slop,2012-07-12 23:19:00,151,"I see the welcoming mat on the doorstep of the bomber got a workout.  Could'nt be happier for Stevie Zee having the hot stick out there.  Mikey musta lost his mind slayin trout on that freshwater ocean.  Different style of literary reporting from you Bunk.  Looking forward to round 2 of ""backdoor hijack"" to Kesagami's Pike.  We're knockin at the door.  "
714191,Moosebunk,2012-07-13 02:44:00,3970,I've NEVER heard that Deep Purple song before... NEVER.  Weird.  But that intro ROCKS so I'll be ripping that off.   Perfect for Backdoor Hijackin' II.  Forest fire ban in the N.E. Slop... guessing when the pike are on fire we'll have to put 'em out quick.  Thanks ladzillas!

712959,wallacio,2012-07-09 16:28:00,475,Amazing.   Any measurements (length and weight) on that last one???
712970,Guidofisherman,2012-07-09 17:14:00,206,Impressive fish and photography. The old Nip gave up some dandy pike and exceptional brookies. I think the lake has the potential to eventually break the almost 100 year of brook trout record. I hope to beat you to it. Alan
712980,Moosebunk,2012-07-09 17:43:00,3970," It'll take a man retired and living there Alan.  I'm pretty well half way there though!!!  And still ""Speck Truckin'""  Enjoy the season dood!  All the best in the quest!"

713007,Rod Caster,2012-07-09 18:49:00,5784,Still not sure what speck trucking really means... but I certainly got a lesson in Speckle-ese.  Makes my fish look like crap.

713114,shimano19,2012-07-09 22:01:00,196,those are some beauty pike! only a matter of time before i hook into one of those mosters
