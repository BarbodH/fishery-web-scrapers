713280,Rich,2012-07-10 12:49:00,3927,"I noticed for the first time when at the paris dam that there is a sanctuary in place for october/november. Ive never caught anything but rock bass, catfish and smallies there.. Saw the odd walleye around.. Just wondering if anyone knows what the sanctuary is in place to protect? Nothing spawns at that time of year that i know of, so it seems strange."
713290,wallacio,2012-07-10 13:19:00,475,It's to protect wintering Bass - see page 20 in the link below:  Grand
713299,dave524,2012-07-10 13:36:00,4508, Thanks really enjoyed reading all that link
713303,Rich,2012-07-10 14:00:00,3927,"Indeed, thank you! That was all a good read! I didn't think many steelhead made it above Caledonia. Interesting."
713309,wallacio,2012-07-10 14:14:00,475,No worries.   Hopefully the whiners won't accuse me of ruining the Grand Steelhead fishery after posting it.
713310,Musky or Specks,2012-07-10 14:15:00,2710,Rich the Nith gets polluted with them if you now were to look
713312,Rich,2012-07-10 14:17:00,3927,"Nice! I saw the definite trout potential in my last trip there. There was one good 6lb brown that kept swimming pretty much between my legs and sitting near me, like he was keeping watch, lol. Wouldn't eat anything I brought, but the smallie fishing was alright."
713326,asdve23rveavwa,2012-07-10 15:04:00,2690," Me too, very interesting read!"
713332,T.Barry,2012-07-10 15:17:00,24,Good info.  didn't expect to see a pic of myself in that article!
713356,tb4me,2012-07-10 16:49:00,3295,That was a fantastic read! I had no idea of the #'s involved in the Grand here in Brantford..I have never tried steelheading in the Grand..I may start now..Thanks for posting that..Did you write that article? If so great job!
713363,wallacio,2012-07-10 17:05:00,475," No, I can't take credit for the article.  It was authored by Larry Halyk of The Wellington County Stewardship Council (also formerly an MNR biologist)."
713375,Musky or Specks,2012-07-10 17:20:00,2710,And the man responsible for bringing Brown trout to the Upper Grand. A great guy and an actual biologist who fishes hardcore.
713377,Spiel,2012-07-10 17:22:00,9065, Great read indeed. Some day I'll have to recant a story to you about (likely) the first Rainbows ever to visit Whitemans Creek.
713385,Musky or Specks,2012-07-10 17:37:00,2710,The first year the dam at the mouth of Whiteman's was removed My buddy and I absolutely hammered them from Rest Acres Rd down to the Grand on the closing weekend in September. It was awesome and totally virgin.
713394,Spiel,2012-07-10 17:58:00,9065," If you don't mind my asking, what year would that be?"
713431,Parisite,2012-07-10 19:31:00,66,Great article. Unfortunately for me it may bring a whole new wave of fishermen into my backyard Please remember that water temps higher than around 68F are not good for summertime trout fishing.
713519,Musky or Specks,2012-07-10 22:44:00,2710,Fall of 90 or 91 can't recall for sure. Rainbows had been leaking past the dam for years.
713522,spincast,2012-07-10 22:53:00,3279,it aint what it used to be  
713717,Spiel,2012-07-11 15:22:00,9065," Thank you.  The first year I caught rainbows in Whitemans was 1974 or 1975. I stood on the bridge with a CO friend who had a truck load of several thousand dumped in. After giving them time to acclimatize and spread out we then fly fished and go figure, my first fish was a 19"" Brown.  I've always suspected that those were indeed the first rainbows in the creek."
