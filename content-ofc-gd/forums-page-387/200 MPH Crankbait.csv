714032,rufus,2012-07-12 17:59:00,267, We would have had to wait a LONG time for that! Actually I do believe pike would strike it as they hit anything that moves and you know what? A couple of those bass may have hit it too - they were that hungry and my casts were landing right on their heads judging by how quickly they bit!
714069,Handlebarz,2012-07-12 20:04:00,3790,Well with all this hype I could not take any more so I took good ol rusty Wallace out of the package and headed to LSC I must say I was pissed I forgot the camera but was shocked to see that in 4 casts I filled my limit even had a canibal eat the lure. I did not release any fish today they were all keepers.                       These must have been very old fish I got a labonte a Stewart a Wallace and a harvick that one looks to be the young gun but it was smiling when I pulled it in such a happy fish.

713442,rufus,2012-07-10 20:05:00,267,"A friend of mine gave me this lure - the 200 MPH Crankbait - and I recently got around to giving it a try. A recorded a little video of the experience which is primarily for his benefit but I thought I would share as I bet few have ever heard of this unique lure.   <center><iframe width=""560"" height=""315"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/r_Wp1gtYBNM"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe></center>"
713443,johnnyb,2012-07-10 20:06:00,3413,Dang that is one fast crankbait....I can't even see it!  Oh wait.... there it is.  Good thing for the edit button
713445,johnnyb,2012-07-10 20:10:00,3413,Well it's certainly unique....maybe a good one for the Nascar crowd..certainly catches fish
713446,misfish,2012-07-10 20:15:00,29133,That was very cool. What car was it?
713454,rufus,2012-07-10 20:32:00,267,Not sure what model car that is or if other models are available. Perhaps there are 180 MPH Crankbaits and 160 MPH Crankbaits as well - I will need to check into that!
713464,mercman,2012-07-10 20:42:00,7054,  :rofl2:  Wasnt drinking coffee this time...........yer luckyB)
713482,Fang,2012-07-10 21:15:00,1330,Notice he never threw it to the right. I guess it's true they only know how to turn left

713503,Rod Caster,2012-07-10 22:07:00,5784,That was good for a smile. Thanks for posting
713545,Toad Hunter,2012-07-10 23:59:00,261,Do they make a 35 mph model for the QEW at 730 am crowd ?
713591,Headhunter,2012-07-11 01:55:00,5703,What was the name of that lure again? HH
713592,NAW,2012-07-11 01:55:00,4022,I wish I had a lake near by that was so rammed with fish that I could catch them on a hot wheels.  Lucky guy!
713603,rufus,2012-07-11 02:24:00,267," Yeah, they will bite on just about anything"
713607,Christopheraaron,2012-07-11 02:39:00,3525,"""it's got hooks!""  I'm sold!"
713636,Dave Bailey,2012-07-11 11:33:00,1641,"  More proof that the most important thing in fishing is to simply get something, anything, in front of their noses.  In other news, toy stores are reporting that they are suddenly being overrun with men looking to purchase Hot Wheels toys, or cheap knock-offs, ""We can't keep them in stock"" said one store manager, ""and for some reason they always ask our check-out clerks where the nearest tackle shop is."" Mattel stocks are rising on the news, and shortages of product are expected."
713905,curlrap,2012-07-12 01:16:00,58,"Looks fake to me, you never see the guy actually get a bite. The fish are all hooked the same and theres way too much editing. Sorry not buying that lure."
713909,dave524,2012-07-12 01:33:00,4508,"I got a bass on a gimmick lure that looked like a Budwiser can, with bass anything is possible"
713912,Handlebarz,2012-07-12 01:36:00,3790,I still have both of my rusty Wallace lures never tried them or my Jr poppers
713922,Joeytier,2012-07-12 02:26:00,3990,"LOL!  Well feel free to ask him.  The OP was the one who made the video, and since he lives in NWO (Northwestern Ontario) where the bass are dumber than a bag of hammers, I'm certainly convinced...  Awesome video btw!"
713960,nancur373,2012-07-12 13:27:00,1211,I catch bass on my coors light can lure all the time
713962,Dave Bailey,2012-07-12 13:41:00,1641,"For anyone wondering where to get them, here's a link. $4 US doesn't seem too bad of a price. I'm not a car guy but I just might pick up some strictly for the lolz.  "
713965,UglyBug,2012-07-12 14:12:00,148,Cool  
713987,jedimaster,2012-07-12 15:26:00,3472," I would tend to agree but I am pretty sure this video is all in fun, and not meant to be serious, but wasn't it italo or waschuck that got whacked for fines for hooking fish on a lure throwing them in and recatching them? I think those were oos or originally snagged or something. Just saying.... this video looks to be all in fun though."
713989,rufus,2012-07-12 15:36:00,267," Yes, the video was all in fun so don't all rush out and buy that lure. I was enjoying the speculation though!"
714028,jedimaster,2012-07-12 17:48:00,3472,"I have to admit I was waiting for the cast, retrieve and smack."
