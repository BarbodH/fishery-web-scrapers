713718,whiskywizard,2012-07-11 15:22:00,305,"The regs say that if you have a valid fishing licence, you may trap leeches for bait:  -limit is 120 leeches -the trap can't be bigger than 17.7"" in any dimension -you may have one trap only -trap must have your name on it. -You can't sell the leeches"
713740,Christopheraaron,2012-07-11 16:18:00,3525,"Tried again with a tin coffee can and some cheap (really bloody) meat, let it sit in the upper rouge overnight and pulled it up at 7:30 this morning, nothing..."
713743,BillM,2012-07-11 16:33:00,17367,Time to find a new spot.
713751,Christopheraaron,2012-07-11 16:53:00,3525,"That's 2 spots so far, I need to find a weedier spot."
712749,sneak_e_pete,2012-07-08 20:10:00,540,"Hi all, wondering if anyone can help me with info on how to catch leeches on lake Erie.  All the bait shops seem to be out and I want to learn how.  Thanks in advance."
712754,davey buoy,2012-07-08 20:25:00,5505," I don't blame you.Dropped by a bait shop Friday,$13.00 a dozen. Is that what they cost now?.Holy cow how prices go up."
712767,Ralph Field,2012-07-08 20:58:00,1018,"I've been told that you can drill holes in a can , put some  cat food in the can, put it in a swampy area and the leeches will swim into the can. I have never tried this but I think that you have to have your name displayed on the can."
712771,Bill Shearer,2012-07-08 21:11:00,456," On fly-in trips, we always tied a string to a filleted Wally carcass, and tossed it in to the lake a few feet at night. When we were ready to go fishing in the morning, just pull in the carcass, harvest the leeches sticking to it, and we were good to go. Never less than a dozen, and most times more."
712786,Ralph Field,2012-07-08 22:26:00,1018,"If you Google "" catching  leeches for bait"" there are some good videos on how to catch them. I learned a lot from watching some of them."
712797,bare foot wader,2012-07-08 23:07:00,1354,"the walleye carcass works well on remote trips  if you're harvesting around home a big coffee can with some nail holes to disperse the scent with a string attached to it...dump in wet cat food and fold the lid the together and kinda fold it down, so they can find their way in but won't flow out when you pull the trap in  or you can go skiing and dump down in some weeds, pick them from your body when you climb back in the boat"
712818,bow slayer,2012-07-09 00:48:00,1074,wow 13 bucks a dozen.....i am leaving next week for a hoilday and i primarily use leeches anyone know the price in the North Bay area?
712824,Canuck2fan,2012-07-09 01:44:00,1444,A buddy of mine uses the wear shorts while you are kicking rocks for crawfish method in the right creeks and you are killing two birds with one stone LOL. When you get out of the water you have the crawfish you netted and just harvest the leechs off your legs.
713069,jim,2012-07-09 20:40:00,124, Forty dollars a pound most places.
713164,Muskieman,2012-07-09 23:44:00,2472,Did you manage ? PM me I know the trick .... crazy simple .
713188,Muskieman,2012-07-10 00:49:00,2472,".............LEECH TACO...................    quick and easy trap.... they can hold about 1/2 to 3/4 lbs of leeches  I find that cool or shaded water in a marshy area works best ...  too easy not to share , nobody should pay retail price for leeches.   Randy "
713190,Muskieman,2012-07-10 00:56:00,2472," that is why my cousin calls them "" Black Gold "" he made 6 figures trapping and wholesaling them last year alone, he's been doing it for more than 15 years ... do the math . Welcome to the Swamp ! Randy "
713272,Rich,2012-07-10 12:34:00,3927," A coffee can with holes drilled in the sides, with raw beef inside as bait. Attach to a string and lay in a warm, muddy, slow current area of a local creek, pond or river.  But better yet,buy the berkley gulp! Leeches... They work as good as live and dont come off the hook so easy."
713273,Rich,2012-07-10 12:35:00,3927,OR you can wade the river with my buddy brandon because he picks them up like a dog picks up fleas in a farmers field . Lmao
713315,moose,2012-07-10 14:25:00,266,You can google and shows different methods to catch leeches
713329,Christopheraaron,2012-07-10 15:14:00,3525,"I tried the coffee can one with an orange juice bottle and got skunked, I'll try aluminium tonight..."
713374,BillM,2012-07-10 17:19:00,17367,Did ya put some meat in there?
713381,whiskywizard,2012-07-10 17:27:00,305,"  I read somewhere that the easiest way is to use your kids. Let them swim in the mucky stuff for a while and they'll bring the leeches right to you. That's where the expression ""take a kid fishing"" comes from."
713382,Christopheraaron,2012-07-10 17:27:00,3525,"Ya, I pu a can of tuna in."
713497,Rich,2012-07-10 21:44:00,3927," You need red meat. Beef is best, fresh, lots of blood. A few chunks of stewing beef or a couple frozen beef shanks do the trick.  They will not ignore red beef blood if there are any around they'll shoot right to it. Check it early in the morning before they move to root in cooler mud."
713509,Christopheraaron,2012-07-10 22:15:00,3525,Is there a way to ensure they can't get out?
713638,beginner,2012-07-11 11:37:00,542,"This is an interesting topic.... My question is, can I just go to a river, creek, swamp or pond and not get in trouble by the MNR? reported by people that see me putting something in the water?"
713656,Ralph Field,2012-07-11 12:29:00,1018,"Minnow traps are suppose to have your name and address attached to them, so I would suspect that you would have to do the same with leech traps, however in the videos I watched I didn't see names on any of the traps."
713669,Rob,2012-07-11 13:02:00,467,I heard that beef liver works really well. Rob C
713675,BillM,2012-07-11 13:28:00,17367, They'll be attached to your piece of meat/liver/whatever that's in the can...
