713138,bushart,2012-07-09 22:49:00,2628,Cause I'd miss out on so much road travel and frustration beer drinking  So the other day I must have lost a bearing buddy  I'm sittin on my porch and looked at my trailer and something looked different  Soo Sunday afternoon---I goes down to the Hardware store---pick up a set of bearing protectors (like beaing buddy's)  We all know---it's easy---push em in and done right???  well I changed the old existing one as well---go to put in grease-----all ends up in front and not going in  OK---maybe my grease gun end is frigged???  So I'm in a town this morn--15 minutes from my house---p/u a new end  come home try again---all out the front  So I dig out my old existing one---put grease gun on---works perfect  Look at back of new buddy's---hole seems a lot smaller on grease nipple discharge side  OK--must be a flaw---back to hardware store--get the last pair on exchange  come home---same thing---ok I've exhausted my local store's inventory  So I call the auto parts store 15 mins away I got my grease gun end  So yep they have a pair 1.98 (pretty standard)  So off I go again--tell them my story as the holes look smaller than my old one again  He says that if it won't work--he lives near me and will drop off refund on way home---I said Cool  So get them home---try grease gun----both work perfect---bingo  Push 1st one in---easy peezy---just like it should  Go round the other side---no pushing req'd---it fell in (so would fall out)  Now I never had size issues with the others-----got my old one on that side---yup--would have to be drove in  Machining was off on new one---so I did get my refund  Now I would'nt bother with this story if I only had 2 bad ones  but 3 strikes and I give up  See all the fun I'd miss out on if we made these in Canada or USA

713221,bushart,2012-07-10 02:25:00,2628,  Well you might as well take your money out and light it on fire---cause no matter how cheap---if it don't work---it don't work and we're no further ahead----just paid less for a dogpile----and the problem still exists
713258,aplumma,2012-07-10 11:14:00,6896, Just to play devils advocate  ...Blame the consumer for unrealistic price expectations from a market that is bending to their cries. No one is forced to purchase an off brand item in most cases there are two levels of products available. We as consumers shape how a product is made by setting a cost point on how much we will spend for the product. The first thing sacrificed is labor the second is material and the last and only if it needs to be is looks. It is not always about how much excess profit can be made but whether enough of a product can be brought to market and sold for it to become profitable.  Art
713271,craigdritchie,2012-07-10 12:34:00,1586,"We have low quality product on store shelves because that is precisely what consumers demand.  Across most of North America, people always buy the cheapest stuff they can get. I'm not talking specialty stuff like fishing gear, I mean normal household goods. Wal-Mart has T-shirts for $4.99? Let's go!  For most people, price trumps quality every single time. The proof is in the immense number of small businesses that have been destroyed all over North America by big box retailers and chain discount stores that sell lower priced, lower quality stuff. People want stuff cheap. The only way for that to happen is to compromise on quality."
713281,bushart,2012-07-10 12:53:00,2628,"Well we're going to need those garbage items at cheap prices cause the good paying manufacturing jobs will be gone and Wal Mart wages will only allow you to shop at ""The Store"""

It's about the perimeters of manufacturing and the originating specs provided by the designer. An eye on quality control is also paramount"

I'm thinking Wally world may also have that self perpetuating philosphy   An employee can go.....I work at Wal Mart so I can make a few bucks so I can only afford to shop at Wal Mart   so I need to work at Wal Mart and make a few bucks so I can only afford to shop at Wal Mart....
713524,aplumma,2012-07-10 22:59:00,6896,"No I am in agreement with you on that thought. I am a plumber by trade and I do not purchase aftermarket parts to install. All of the products are brand name units and that still does not rule out parts were made abroad. I have found that the labor rate I command makes cheap parts a foolish investment on both ends, me because of my warrentee and my customers for a short life of the products. I try to keep my purchases intelligent and research them thoroughly  but once decided it is rarely the price that changes my mind.   Art"
