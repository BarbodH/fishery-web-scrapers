713387,Acountdeleted,2012-07-10 17:45:00,2562,"Just curious, did anyone enter it? If so, how was it?  I was fishing island lake in my Kayak friday and I kept seening these bass boats in the water. I joked with my friend that they were entering the big tournament the next day, then when we were leaving I saw a sign for the big tournament the next day.  It seems like a small lake to be holding a bass tournament but I guess the strict catch and release policy puts less pressure on the fish the other 364 days of the year."
713393,cityfisher,2012-07-10 17:56:00,959,they allowed Motor boats for a couple days? must have been a riot!! ussually electric motor only lake
713396,johnnyb,2012-07-10 18:01:00,3413,Motors weren't allowed...just that guys bring their bass boats and fish with the trolling motor
713399,Carp,2012-07-10 18:02:00,1488,Can't see most motor boats even getting up to full speed before they reach the other side of the lake.
713402,Christopheraaron,2012-07-10 18:11:00,3525,"I fished it, it's actually a great bass lake, after that rain though it was tough fishing, the winner came in at 5.2 pounds, it was my first tournament so the size helped me get accustomed to it. We're you there jonny?"
713429,johnnyb,2012-07-10 19:21:00,3413,"Nope, I wasn't there....but would have been nice to try it out.  Fun little lake for sure....too bad they kick you out in the evenings....would be a great spot to hit after work if you could stay later and make the drive worthwhile."
713486,Acountdeleted,2012-07-10 21:24:00,2562, My thoughts exactly. Looked like a great lake when I was there puttering around. Its a shame I didn't know about the tourney. I probabally would have entered for fun. The fact that 5+ pound bass come out of there is awesome.
713490,misfish,2012-07-10 21:31:00,29133,"  See what you misseed 27 years ago. We use to just park off the side of hwy 10,and fish all night.Back then,we were also getting nice brown trout."
713660,cityfisher,2012-07-11 12:44:00,959, Makes sense..  Was it just a big fish tourney? no bag of 5 fish?
713667,johnnyb,2012-07-11 12:59:00,3413,"Yep, they are looking for the biggest fish.  Interesting way they do it --- they score it based on one point per gram, and one point per millimeter.  So a 4lb fish is 1814.4 grams and measures 406 mm the total score is 2220.4.  They pay out $2500 for 1st, $1000 for 2nd, $500 for 3rd place (for bass), and also have $100 prizes for biggest pike, crappie and perch.  Still looking for the 2nd and 3rd place fish, but can't find them.....really not a bad little tournament I think."
713736,Christopheraaron,2012-07-11 16:12:00,3525,It was run like any big tournament (minus the scoring) I can't remember the 2nd and 3rd place winners but the lowest bass came in at 4.7 pounds.
