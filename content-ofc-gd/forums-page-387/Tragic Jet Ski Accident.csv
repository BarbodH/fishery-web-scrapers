The boy is brain dead, be careful on the water people.  http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/gossip/usher-torn-stepson-11-declared-brain-dead-jet-ski-accident-article-1.1111294"
713563,Fisherman,2012-07-11 00:48:00,7201,That is beyond sad.  Why can't everyone leave a bit of room for others to enjoy themselves.
713568,Pikeslayer8,2012-07-11 01:02:00,336,I don't care if you are an usher or the popcorn maker.   Jet skies suck.
713577,Mike the Pike,2012-07-11 01:21:00,3421,that is  sad news
713593,Live2fish85,2012-07-11 01:57:00,1633,Some sad news.  I hate Jet Skies and 90% of morons them.
713596,GreenCanada,2012-07-11 02:03:00,375,Truly surprised it doesn't happen more often. Sad to see this happen to anyone.
713663,cityfisher,2012-07-11 12:49:00,959,+Very Sad .. +Hate Jet Skis... im sure its standard for most fisherman... On sunday they were cirling my boat all day it seemed... Brutal
713685,jimmer,2012-07-11 14:20:00,2730,"I had 10 coming straight for me on Sunday night and it kind of looked like they were attacking. :-( A couple veared off closer to another boat fishing in very shallow weedy water and proceeded to do a couple of donuts. I just shook my head. I hate them. Too many people that have no idea what they are doing get behind those things. An accident waiting to happen, for sure. A very sad loss for all those involved."
