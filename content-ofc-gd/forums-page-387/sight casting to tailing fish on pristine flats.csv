I was using my 9wt fly rod and casting at tailing carp and much to my surprise I caught one! The fish took a wooly bugger and ran deep into my backing before I slowed it down and turned it around.It must have weighed 20 plus lbs and it was a thrill to hear my drag scream like never before. This must be the closest thing to salt water flats fishing we have, and would be great practice for anyone planning a trip south. Shallow sand flats and big wary fish that Im sure run as hard as any bonefish or redfish is a fun combination! Sneakin up using the electric worked pretty good and there was no shortage of them to cast at. I plan on doing more of it."

Wading along the shoreline, keeping close to the bushes so I won't be seen, watching for mud clouds to show me where a carp is feeding. Then toss my bait in close (usually a crayfish) and watching a big dark shape rush in. A big splash, then screaming drag and the fight is on. Fishing for bonefish on the flats down south somewhere would be good practice for this type of carp fishing."
