709882,kickingfrog,2012-06-28 00:14:00,8333," Thanks for the tip. I signed up, added a $7 lure to the $99 reel and with shipping it's $101.49 US.  And thanks to John for the original lead."
709888,nroadrunner,2012-06-28 00:38:00,113,"Trying to talk myself into buying one LOL  I have only fished baitcasters for 2 years.  Wasnt sure if I would like them so I bought a BPS Bionic, this would be a huge upgrade.    Ian"
709889,Dan668,2012-06-28 00:46:00,1120,"If youd like a lefty, try tacklewarehouse same price."
709891,mike rousseau,2012-06-28 00:53:00,4661,  Thanks
709893,backbay,2012-06-28 00:57:00,773,That's pretty fair shake on that reel. Looks like ABU is clearing inventory ahead of bringing in the new Revos.
709901,rmarentette,2012-06-28 01:22:00,124,I just pulled the trigger and ordered one. I was checking this reel out earlier this year. Thanks for the heads up! I'm going up north in two weeks so it will get a good workout.
709922,Dan668,2012-06-28 02:34:00,1120, Wait till first week of july. Chances are theyll have 10-15 percent off. Shipping will run u 15 but its 2day. Its ups but no fear most pf my small orders get over no problem. The expensive ones are just taxed. No outrageous fees
709933,nroadrunner,2012-06-28 03:44:00,113,Anyone else having problems with there code?.  Mine says not valid.  I have typed it and tried cutting and pasting.    Ian
709934,bow slayer,2012-06-28 03:46:00,1074,"if they are shipping with ups there will be a brokerage charge when brown shows up at your door,last time for me it was 35 bucks."
709942,Dan668,2012-06-28 06:35:00,1120,I order a few times a year with them. Not all ups services get hit with brokerage
709977,mike rousseau,2012-06-28 12:17:00,4661," The revo ""SX"" on tacklewarehouse site is 129.99 not 99.99 like the OP site... From what I saw anyways..."
710001,Dan668,2012-06-28 13:40:00,1120,"Oops i glanced to quickly, mistook it for the s."
710003,John,2012-06-28 13:46:00,2956,"If you are shipping to Canada do NOT use UPS they make millions every year through their customs brokerage services to private individuals.I do use them to clear commercial goods going in and out of the US and I can clear a $100,000 shipment for less than $50.......they charge $30 or so for a $100 item if you don't have a negotiated contract with them.............I always use USPS."
710051,Garry2Rs,2012-06-28 16:00:00,1425,"I bought a reel through American Legacy last summer.   They seem to be good people to deal with. I asked them to send my reel USPS they said ""No problem.""  I don't think I paid anything extra at the boarder."
710182,RangerGuy,2012-06-29 01:11:00,564,Do the revo's have a flipping switch?
710186,kickingfrog,2012-06-29 01:28:00,8333,Mine doesn't.
714040,rmarentette,2012-07-12 18:28:00,124,"I took advantage of the special price and ordered the Revo SX for $99.95 and two packages of reaction Innovation Worms for $9.38 for a subtotal of $109.33. I received a discount of -$9.38. For those who were asking about the shipping , it was $18.95 and sent by US postal Service. The total was $118.90. So I basically got the innovation worms for free. It was mailed last Friday and I received it today. I leave on my trip north tomorrow and had time to try the new reel. I matched with a 6'9 inch Vendetta rod and it is sweet!!!!!!!! This was the first time I've ordered from American Legacy and I'm very pleased."
714050,bow slayer,2012-07-12 18:49:00,1074,"I also ordered one,have not received it yet and i leave saturday for 2 weeks,have my fingers crossed for tomorrow."
714051,BucktownAngler,2012-07-12 18:50:00,582," Any duties, or customs fees?"
714053,rmarentette,2012-07-12 18:52:00,124,"Nothing, just paid as quoted."
