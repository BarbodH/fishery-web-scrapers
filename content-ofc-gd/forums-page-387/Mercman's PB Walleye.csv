712811,Mike the Pike,2012-07-09 00:16:00,3421,Well finally set up a time I could fish with the Mercman.So Friday night I accepted an invite from Paul To go fishing on the St.Lawrence.Now I have been in a lot of boats before and Paul is Mr.Organized I have never seen such a well organized boat.I did bring him to my lucky spot and we did just fine considering we were only out for a couple of hours.Caught five walleye if you count the little dinker and my sheep herding skills came back to haunt me as I picked up a 4 to 5lb sheepy which I released boat side.  Just a couple of pics.Thanks Paul for taking me out I had a great time fishing with you.Until next time.   this is Paul's PB walleye Petit Baby.
