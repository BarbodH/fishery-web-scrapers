We caught 3 in total 1got off right away the other 2 we had a good fight well not really a fight it was more like I am going this way and you are coming with me. The first one got off after only a few min ran right into the prop and it was gone it was about 6 to 7 ft according to the biologist on board . The second the other lad on the boat just a young guy but seemed like he knew his stuff he was from niagra area and fished for samon got a crack at he fought it for a bit till he was tired and then I took over it ran out about a 1/4 mile and I dragged him back in after maybe 15 min or so got it up to the boat it swam to the back and rightnintomthe prop again and gone. Wow u wouldn't believe the power these things had on trip I won't soon forget. There was some video taken if they email it to me I will post it up
