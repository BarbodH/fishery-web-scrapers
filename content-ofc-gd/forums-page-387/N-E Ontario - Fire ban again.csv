714188,Tootsie II,2012-07-13 02:37:00,162,MNR just announced another fire ban for the whole of the North-Eastern Ontario area. Kinda figured it was coming with the weekend approaching as things are so dry and I and my fishing partner are getting ready to head out near Shining Tree next week. Guess we'll just have to keep the garbage locked in the back of the truck instead of burning it. LOL!
