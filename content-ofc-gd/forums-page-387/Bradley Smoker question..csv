713876,wallyboss,2012-07-11 22:48:00,1095,I bought a Bradley Smoker and time has come to make ribs. I have read that there is a lot of different ways to do ribs. 3-2-1  ect.  But it seems like all the info I can find is only for a couple of racks of Babyback ribs.  My question is for other Bradley users what are your favorite ways of doing ribs for 8 people. 1 or 1/2 rack per person? How much longer do you have to leave it cooking?

713964,dannyboy,2012-07-12 13:53:00,367,With the smoker full it will take longer to get up to temperature so leave some extra time. Make sure the heat can circulate so you don't get any cool spots. Rolling the ribs can help to fit more in the smoker:    Dan

714207,johndox,2012-07-13 03:36:00,54,if you have more than one rack full I would suggest you rotate the racks so the bottom ones do not over cook and dry out. I am firing mine up tomorrow and doing a pork shoulder for pulled pork and some venison baked beans. Looking forward to it!
