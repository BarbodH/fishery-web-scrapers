713199,hookerdown,2012-07-10 01:14:00,110,I rented a cottage up there last year.  We didn't catch any eyes up there but I talked to a guy who lives up there and he said they do catch the odd one.  On a side note there are some nice smallies up there.  I had a large muskie hit a Berkley Gulp Alive.
713210,Rizzo,2012-07-10 01:44:00,4754,Where did you buy? I have a cottage up that way and I know a piece of land near me for sale...maybe we are neighbours now?
713324,raysfish2005,2012-07-10 14:55:00,163,"  Thanks Raff,Hook and Rizzo, we picked up a sweet piece on Haystead bay rd, not on the water but very close, we are in the process of building, we are close to the timmies at the 214 exit. and only 15 minutes from the boat so it works out really nice."
713584,Rizzo,2012-07-11 01:43:00,4754,"I'm real close to that Timmies as well, down Windfall Lake Rd. I've fished Crane a couple of times. Caught a nice big incidental walleye (6 pounder), a few pike, and raised a big musky - head like a shovel. Enjoy your place up there!"
