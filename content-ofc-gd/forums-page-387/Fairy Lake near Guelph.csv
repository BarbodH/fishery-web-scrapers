713668,torco,2012-07-11 13:02:00,656," I assume you mean the one in Acton? It has bass, pike, crappie, carp and panfish in it."
713670,Canitalian,2012-07-11 13:06:00,75,Yes that one. Thanks torco
713672,ryan micallef,2012-07-11 13:16:00,1,"Fished it last year twice. Targeting bass both times, put in full days. Not much luck with anything over 2 pounds."
713732,GreenCanada,2012-07-11 16:01:00,375,"I have always found it to be so full of weeds it was almost not worth fishing from a canoe. That being said, I have caught both bass and pike in there (on the small side). Not worth it IMO, lots of better options in that area."
713767,torco,2012-07-11 17:46:00,656,"Yes I agree, not worth it.  It can be a fun lake, granted most fish are the smallish side there are some decent fish to be had. My advice is to try one evening if its not too far a drive and fish topwater, it will keep you busy for a few hrs."
713770,Canitalian,2012-07-11 17:47:00,75,I appreciate all the info you all. Thanks.
