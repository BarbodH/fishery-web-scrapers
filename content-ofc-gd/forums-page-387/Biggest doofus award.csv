714041,SRT8 smoker craft,2012-07-12 18:32:00,1107,I think I have told this one here before but a couple years ago we were fishing near the entrance to a marina on the st clair river the channel is deep enough to have large frieghters in and out and it has a sand bar that comes off the seawall we were fishing the drop off and the weed line off of that sand bar when a 36-38' sea-ray comes down river 25' from is at 30mph turns 180 degree's and goes up the channel 25-30' up the other side of us causing a 4-5' wake coming at us from both sides we were in a 21' triton bassboat and it was full to the gunnels I had to do a Tebow and hold on for dear life on the back deck to stay in the boat it washed my sciccors and some soft plastics into the river the bilge pumps took 10 mins to empty the boat out if it wasn't full of water we would have chased them into the marina I thought we were going to sink . I always have bone heads run to close on longpoint bay it doesn't even bother me anymore
714068,Ralph Field,2012-07-12 20:04:00,1018,"Another reason this award should be mine occurred on the opening of bass season on long point bay. We were fishing in the opening day tournament and in the distance we could see a storm coming our way. Instead of heading in when the sky turned greenish we stayed too long and got caught in a terrible storm. We thought we could hide in the rushes for cover only to discover the waves were every bit as high there as they were in the open. the waves were washing over our bow and filling my 35 year old boat with water. When my friend noticed that the water was up to my knees he panicked and flagged over a large cruiser. The water was too rough to transfer my friend to the other boat and I still had power so he left and we continued to limp in. We went to the old cut because it was the fastest way off the bay. While having coffee at the old cut marina we observed a couple of boats,which were about the size of mine being towed in overturned. We later learned that a 40 ft sailboat had been capsized in the storm. We bailed the boat out after the storm passed and headed back to the marina on the causeway where I had launched. I had to replace about 300 rivittes in the bottom of my boat as a result of our adventure ,but no one was hurt so the rest doesn't matter."
714099,lew,2012-07-12 21:33:00,12766,"When I was in the Navy back in the 60's we used to spend alot of time  working down in the Carribean. We were in Barbados one time when we were ordered out to join a  search for a fishing boat with 3 men aboard that was 3 days overdue from an island south of Trinidad. We headed south and fortunately we were the ones that found them a couple days later. They were all in pretty bad shape after all that time baking in the Carribean sun but at least they were still alive.  We got them aboard our ship and under the care of our medical staff and were able to lift their rickety old boat up onto the helicopter pad with our crane.  It was an old wooden boat with an inboard engine and they'd snapped the drive-shaft on the 1st day out and began drifting with the currents. They had enough water and food for 2 days and when we finally found them they'd been drifting for 5 days in the hot sun and were near death from lack of water. They'd caught and gutted a shark and were eating that raw.  They were extremely poor folks and there was no such thing as VHF either on their boat or on the island that they could use to call for help.  We sailed to their island and used one of our smaller boats to transport them ashore and tow their old boat in. We also took up a collection, plus gave them a ton of food,  clothing, tools, books and anything else we could find that would help them. They told us the money we gave them was more than they'd earn in a year of working yet it didn't seem like very much to us.  It was half a century ago but is still something I think about every once in awhile and this thread brought it back to me.  It's  something I was very proud to be a part of so long ago and I'm sure to this day folks on that tiny Carribean island are still talking about how kind a ship load of sailors from the Canadian Navy were to a group of total strangers.  No doofus awards for those folks as they were just 3 very poor men trying to earn a living with terrible equipment and I thought I'd pass on the story.  Hope my thoughts from many years ago didn't bore anyone."

714113,mercman,2012-07-12 21:59:00,7054,"On my way home tonite, i was in the center lane, had signals on to move right and exit the highway.There was a big hairy dude on a Harley in the right lane doing about 90 K. I accelertated slightly, and so did he. So i slowed down a bit, and so did he Finally, i moved in behind him and signaled that i was getting off. He was yelling and screaming like a fool, and followed me off at my exit,slowing me and everyone behind me down to a crawl.At the stop sign, he pulled up beside me and began curseing at me in french useing some really good words that i had not heard in along time.Something about my mother and sister, and some mention to my dog. The wife is freaking right about now, and i rolled my window down and stared him in the eyes.He put the kick down and went to get off the bike.I said ""Nice Bike man"".....he froze in his tracks.""Thanks"" he said looking confused as to why i was not afraid of him. Then i said it......dont ask me why, i have no clue.The wife drew a gasp in so deep, i thought she was haveing an attack.I said...""Tell me, do they make them for men too?"" I dont think anyone has ever talked to him like that.I felt that tight feeling you know where, when your body senses that its going to experience trauma. He just shook his head, and laffed so hard, all he could do was get back on the bike, and fly off in a cloud of dust and harley noise. The wife called me a big Dufus, and i though of this thread."

(sp?)  I have had run ins with silly (possibly drunk) people driving too close or at too high a speed but the all time best had to be when my best friend and I first caught the muskie bug and decided to take a trip to the Kawartha's.  We were fishing our first morning on Buckhorn Lake, casting a shoreline while it was nice and peaceful when all of a sudden a doofus in an air boat comes flying right by us within about I'd say 30 feet, 40 max.  Now he had the whole lake behind us but decided it was better to drive by right in front of us along the shore where we were casting.  He waved as he flew past, friendly chap.  My friend and I just looked at each other like, did that really just happen???  Fortunately no persons or equipment were harmed during this incident.   We still laugh about this ignoramace every once in a while.  What are people thinking???"
713816,Squid,2012-07-11 19:23:00,1656,A 30 foot cabin crusier decides to accelerate while passing under the fort erie bridge. I was going down river and the crusier was going up into Lake Erie. The boat threw a 4 foot high set of waves at me and almost swamped my 19 foot lund. Man I was beside myself. Boaters that have travelled under the fort erie bridge know just how dangerous that water is!

713875,Ralph Field,2012-07-11 22:38:00,1018,The first time I fished the St. Clair river I was fishing in the shipping channel and kept my eye on an approaching freighter and marveling at it's size as it approached us. As it got closer I noticed the size of the bow wave it was producing and had to open my engine up and head for shore and still barely missed swamping the boat so I think that I deserve the award.
713879,bobowski,2012-07-11 22:59:00,360,"One time I was out on Georgian Bay and was working a nice shoreline for Bass about 50 feet from the shore. There was two of us on the boat both casting Hulla Poppers so it was very clear that we were fishing. I see a boat aproaching us and I figure that it will pass behind us. Nope, instead this idiot drives exactly in between us and the shoreline. All I could do was shake my head."

As soon as it started getting dark, all these boaters start flying towards the bay to see the fireworks.  Probably about 15-20 boats (mostly cruisers) flew by us at full speed right where we were fishing. It got to the point where we had to move or else possibly get hit.  Someone actually died that night i believe"

Never did see the boat. Thankfully we never heard him hit anyone."

I didn't get that close, but I did to make sure he heard my engine and felt the rocking of the waves.  What an idiot..  So many back bays to spend the night in on that lake."

He was maybe 30' from the back of the boat if our lines weren't down deep he would have easily cut them.  I gave him a friendly wave and he slowed down and came back to see what our problem was. If I had something big enough after our talk his boat would have had a hole in it.  Some people have no brains."

Felt obligated to make sure they made it past the cross current chop, thankfully they stopped before it or we would of been put in danger as well.  I deserve the award too Staffman.. A severe storm came up on us in a T in Simcoe a few years ago and we were at the top end of the lake. We had almost won the T the day before and had another great bag that day that could win.  We tried to run back to cooks for the weigh in right in the centere of this flash storm.  We saw other boats running behind the islands to ride it out.  I had never seen Lady Simcoe so mean, nor have a since! The waves were huge, that's fine we are used to that, the worst part is they were so close together.  Impossible to navigate in a 20 foot boat. You would crest one and the one behind would slam you and so on.  We made it half way and turned back to hide behind Thorah.  We almost didn't make it.  Water was up over the seats with both bilges at capacity.  Trolling motor busted, both windsheilds busted and our egos. We put oursleves and possibly other anglers in danger that were watching us.  Unfortunately a couple folks did lose their lives that day.  It is ok to make mistakes, as long as you learn from them."

This 35ft+ cruiser is idling towards us and when about 20ft away decides to get up on plane.  Only had to go another 30-40 ft to be respectful of our position and not throw the 4-5ft wake at us.   Last year on Lake Ontario it was a beautiful start to the day and then the fog rolled in. We kept on fishing and blasting the horn every so often to let others know that there was another boat in the area. I hear the sound of a boat that appears to running at WOT, are you kidding me??  Sound the horn as this  is getting closer and then appears and misses my planer board by about 20ft. He has the wife and kids on board heading somewhere in a hurry. As he see's me I hear the wife yelling at him to slow down which he did as he disappeared into the fog again. Can only imagine the silence (and rightfully so) aboard that boat until they reached their destination.  Certainly have had many other doofus encounters but those two are most remembered. Also got to love the boat launch doofus's but that is another thread on it's own."

Well my old motor was tricky and you had to twist the throttle all the way to get it started after it had been sitting awhile, so I opened the throttle and pulled the cord, not realizing the boat was in forward, not nuetral. I missed another boat that was tied to the dock by about 4-5' and there were a bunch of people sitting by the docks in lawn chairs, man did I ever feel like a jackass lol."

Was fishing bass a few miles out on Erie. I was fishing away the waves were a foot maybe foot and a half. All the forecasts said that the winds were going to calm down. All of a sudden I feel the winds pick up big time probably blowing 30kmh from the SW. I figured I would give it a few more minutes to see if it was just a gust thing that happens on Erie. Shortly after I notice the dark clouds rolling in and the wind picked up again. By the time I got my Lifejacket on and the motor going the waves had got alot bigger. Next thing you know, I am out in a 16.5 foot Deep V with a 70hrsp and the waves were at least 6.5' and white caping all over. I had the bilge going constantly and was lucky to get back. If someone else was driving the boat I would have had a crapped my pants forsure.  If it weren't for my grandfather teaching me how to boat since I was a kid I highly doubt J would have made it. Erie is one nasty lake when it wants."
