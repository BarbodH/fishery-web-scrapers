713959,woodenboater,2012-07-12 13:24:00,2277,Wonder if Frabill make a cradle that size
713800,Lip-ripper,2012-07-11 18:48:00,228,"Awesome video and from what I can tell, not fake.  http://www.break.com/index/just-some-fishing-when-holy-crap-shark-2344129  I wouldn't be taking any swims off that dock!"
713805,davey buoy,2012-07-11 18:54:00,5505,  Wow is all I can say.I guess so important for the net to get it first time.LOL.Good times I see.
713813,kickingfrog,2012-07-11 19:09:00,8333,So what was it?
713820,tb4me,2012-07-11 19:41:00,3295,lol i think they filled their undies there...Great vid!!!
713822,crappieperchhunter,2012-07-11 19:47:00,2582,They talk funny
713837,Walleye'm Fishing,2012-07-11 20:42:00,310,That's pretty much exactly how I'd react...
713843,rufus,2012-07-11 20:53:00,267,Wow! Great footage! What lives under your dock? Swimming anyone?
713846,Bassaholic,2012-07-11 21:02:00,74,And my girlfriend gets freaked out when there's a snapping turtle by the dock...LOL
713857,Christopheraaron,2012-07-11 21:17:00,3525,Awesome! but why are they breaking off the shark? a good fisherman would try to land it!  http://www.theage.com.au/travel/travel-news/shark-follows-kayaker-as-jaws-fears-hit-us-20120710-21svg.html
713858,Nipfisher,2012-07-11 21:19:00,2449,"""I got it on Camera"" that's too funny."
713859,Parisite,2012-07-11 21:32:00,66,Found this while surfing the net.  Caution: contains language that may be offensive to some.  http://thechive.com/2012/07/11/fishing-when-all-of-a-sudden-video/  I would probably react the same way.
713861,Christopheraaron,2012-07-11 21:36:00,3525,This was just posted...
713866,Muskieman,2012-07-11 21:42:00,2472,"Now that's pretty cool , I would have used BIGGER words for sure!"
713877,bobowski,2012-07-11 22:48:00,360, Try and land that?  Anyone know where this was and what kind of Shark it was?
713886,kickingfrog,2012-07-11 23:49:00,8333, I don't think they had much say in the matter.
713887,Rizzo,2012-07-12 00:02:00,4754,That was one big Shawk
713900,NAW,2012-07-12 00:52:00,4022,That one they wont forget for a while.  You see it on fishing shows all the time.  But that's the first I seen one come from around a dock shore fishing like that.  Very cool!
713920,Locnar,2012-07-12 02:20:00,645,The big one that got away.
713936,backbay,2012-07-12 03:45:00,773,Everybody out of the pool!
713939,Cudz,2012-07-12 04:50:00,2652,The type of shark was a BFS.  Big Freakin Shark.  It jumped so I guess maybe a Mako.  I am going to try and pause it to see if I can Identify it.
713940,Cudz,2012-07-12 04:53:00,2652,Maybe it is a bronze whaler but its shape actually makes it look like a Great white
713941,highdrifter,2012-07-12 07:23:00,2534, Makos don't come in land like that...  Id say it's a Bull shark!
713944,Bassaholic,2012-07-12 10:44:00,74,"Looks like a bull to me too...they are notorious for entering freshwater rivers too, one of the few sharks that can."
713949,jigsnreels,2012-07-12 11:56:00,133,"Agreed on bull shark.  Short snout and small dorsal fin, and they're native to the US Southeast coast.  She should have landed it."
713953,Christopheraaron,2012-07-12 12:33:00,3525,anyone just see this on sportsnet?
