713696,addy79,2012-07-11 14:51:00,573,"Hey All,  I'm planning on purchasing a boat from the US and wondering if anyone in the community has any experience in doing this? I'd like to avoid paying a broker to do the leg work for me. The research I've done so far indicated that I'd have to pay HST on the black book value of the boat(not purchase price), and a licensing fee (not sure how much it is). I know the trailer must be registered in order to transfer ownership to Canada and that the purchase agreement would have to be at the border 3 days before I get there.  Is there anything else I am missing??  Also, this will be my first boat purchase and admitedly, I am not very familiar with boat mechanics. What are some things I should be looking for when inspecting the boat? I've heard of some expensive repairs when the ""lower unit"" is in need of repair/replacement - what are the tell tale signs of this? I'm thinking that my safest bet would be to have a local boat mechanic give the boat a once over...  Looking at a 17' fish and ski style boat such as a Tracker/Lund/Sylvain/Crestliner.  Any input and advice is greatly appreciated!  Thanks everyone. Adam "

713711,addy79,2012-07-11 15:08:00,573," LOL  no kidding, seems relatively painless nonetheless. I may PM you with some questions.  thanks!!"
713715,addy79,2012-07-11 15:19:00,573,So the RIV fee is $209. Most of the info I'm researching is a little dated (reffering to GST and PST); previously you paid GST and PST on the boat and PST on the trailer. Is it safe to assume you now just pay HST for both??
713719,bare foot wader,2012-07-11 15:24:00,1354,"if you're not overly familiar with boat mechanics get a marina to look it over, might cost a small fee but worth it in the long run  things that I got ""burned"" on my first used boat purchase  -livewell and bilge pump didn't work, had to lift the floor, easy enough but still a pita  -wiring, previous owner must have re-wired at some point and didn't use marine grade...in the process of rewiring now, marine grade ain't cheap  -i bought from auction, decent deal but couldn't water test...needs a new teleflex cable or the steering box needs some love  -the throttle remote is pretty touchy in the mid range, will get a friend to help me with that  -trailer lights didn't work, rather than mess around i re-did the lights and wiring, cost a little over 100  not advice on the US import but I would think calling customs would give you the straight and quick answer"
713725,BillM,2012-07-11 15:40:00,17367,"Picked up our Lund Pro Sport from Michigan, super simple process.  Although there are a few things you need to make sure you have in order.  Seeing that Michigan is a non-title state (For anything under 20ft) you'll need to have a letter from the bank stating there are no liens on the boat(If there are liens, you won't be allowed to bring it across)  RIV fee and the taxes are paid at the border (On the boat), you'll pay a bit more at the MTO when you go to plate the trailer.  Very easy process, we were in and out of customs within 5 mins.  Make sure the trailer also has the inspection sticker/serial on it (Located near one of the tail lights), you'll need when registering it here.  Also make sure you declare anything over 10k in cash if going across the border."
