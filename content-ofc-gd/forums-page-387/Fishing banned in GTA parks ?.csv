713328,Christopheraaron,2012-07-10 15:08:00,3525,"Sorry for digging this one up, but after the ban was lifted are we allowed to fish anywhere along the harbourfront now?"
713426,Snidley,2012-07-10 19:07:00,620,"It's a small thing but even so, good for Rob Ford. I actually sympathize with people walking on a board walk with guys slinging lures out there. I've seen some pretty careless pier chuckers and a busy boardwalk with lots of non anglers and kids could be a recipe for eye /head injuries etc."
713474,Ron,2012-07-10 20:52:00,1683,"  The responsibility falls on both parties involved. Similar to pedestrians crossing a street for an example, they have to be aware of vehicles in their surroundings as well as people driving vehicles, they have to be aware of pedestrians crossing their paths.  Cheers, Ron..."
713485,muskymatt,2012-07-10 21:21:00,2608,"What's next? Banning Stanley cup contenders   :rofl2:  Seriously though, what a complete shame, kids can only access fishing from shore most times.  Pathetic"
713506,Billy Bob,2012-07-10 22:10:00,5865, I'm not much of a hockey fan......but didn't they already do that years ago in Toronto......
713511,Ralph Field,2012-07-10 22:20:00,1018,They vote Wednesday July 11 and hopefully the fishing will remain open.
713625,Rich,2012-07-11 10:21:00,3927,Yet another reason to never visit toronto.
705074,Lunker777,2012-06-12 15:54:00,866,"I took this from another forum....  The signs went up June 6. Fishing Prohibited. Local Anglers are fighting it through the media right now. Google it, lend a hand, who knows it could be your city next.  http://www.thestar.com/news/article/1209731--toronto-anglers-baffled-by-sudden-fishing-ban-on-waterfront  http://www.globaltoronto.com/Pages/MorningSegment.aspx?id=6442659112  http://nationalprostaff.com/report/2542/Petition++Say+No+to+the+City+of+Toronto+banning+Fishing+on+its+waterfronts"
705080,jigsnreels,2012-06-12 16:04:00,133,Just another bizarre policy decision from Ford Nation...  
705084,Ralph Field,2012-06-12 16:11:00,1018,It is a shame they banned fishing in parks paid for and maintained by tax payers. Is this a case of slob fishermen leaving their garbage behind for others to clean up ?
705086,Lunker777,2012-06-12 16:13:00,866," I dont think its the case.... according to one article, "" An older couple were disrupted on there walk by a fisherman casting"" and "" a paddle boat got tangled up with a fishermans line""  Unreal..."
705099,rmarentette,2012-06-12 16:52:00,124,"That's funny, we just had a complaint recently in Windsor about someone fishing in one of our riverfront parks interfering with a couple walking in the park as well. The circumstances are strangely similar. Over the years we've had people complain about bike riders and roller bladers, but no one called for a ban. I hope we don't see this spreading to other communities. We have always had a lot of people fishing in our parks and it's never been a big issue. I hope they can turn this around after all, public means public!"
705105,hammercarp,2012-06-12 17:06:00,964,"Bike riding, rollerblading, skateboarding all pose a greater problem than fishing does."
705106,jigsnreels,2012-06-12 17:06:00,133,One of the articles I found stated that the ban was the result of 7 complaints over a three year period.  Maybe that older couple are the parents of the Ford brothers?
705116,Raf,2012-06-12 17:34:00,3495,the ford brothers have two votes on council and i'd be VERY surprised if they were the ones that introduced this. mayhaps look at adam vaughn (speculating) or another one of his ilk.
705119,rmarentette,2012-06-12 17:41:00,124," It couldn't be. If I was one of the parents, I wouldn't be out walking in public lol!"
705124,torco,2012-06-12 17:49:00,656,I think from reading the article this was a staff decision and never went to council
705127,Headhunter,2012-06-12 17:58:00,5703,"According to the news at noon, it's going before committee tonight... given that Toronto Harbour is Federal, I thnk, does the city have any legal right to do this? And I gotta agree with Raf on this one... HH"
705129,davey buoy,2012-06-12 18:01:00,5505,"To keep up the riding and walking trails take a lot more to maintain than ""A normal"" fisherman walking to a bank and throwing a line in. I stress the""normal leave the area better than you found it angler"". Having said that I almost think were a minority."
705193,bigreddog,2012-06-12 20:47:00,84,Hmmm. You'd think the elderly couple and paddle boater should've gotten charged for interfering with an angler.  Maybe we should try and get elderly pedestrians and recreational boaters banned.
705207,Carp,2012-06-12 22:07:00,1488,"Here's my response on a facebook page dedicated to fight this idiotic move. Facebook page  I suspect some wealthy Toronto waterfront boat owners are using their friends on Toronto's City Council and Management Staff to impose this ridiculous fishing ban.  Why stop with waterfront fishing. How about banning boating, jet skis, surfing, sail boarding, sailing, scuba diving, swimming, snorkeling, sun tanning, jogging, dog walking, sports activities, family gatherings and barbeques, baby strollers, roller blades, skate boards, bicycles, tricycles, walking, breathing, etc.  If anything, fishing should be encouraged all across the Toronto waterfront. Anglers support area businesses and spend millions of dollars. Daily boat launch users also pay user fees, which in my opinion is ridiculous as well. Do all the above activities pay fees to use the parks and waterfront ? Why are boat launch users singled out ? Waive the launching fees and I'll bet you'll see even more cash injection into the local economy. Don't keep restricting and banning people from public areas that their tax dollars paid for. Allow ALL people to enjoy the parks, trails and waterways, not just a select few.  Along with many friends and family, I await the city council decision on this matter. We will be looking specifically for councillors who support this fishing ban and pass on the information. The internet is a wonderful tool to inform people of issues like this and help them vote accordingly in the next election. "
705228,smally21,2012-06-12 23:24:00,993,Are there user fees at toronto public launches?
705255,adempsey,2012-06-13 01:03:00,1498,The problem IMO is that this sets a precedent for other cities and towns.  I can see the Simcoe shoreline in Barrie and Innisfil going next.
705300,Ralph Field,2012-06-13 02:50:00,1018,The Windsor waterfront would be my guess.
705303,Dara,2012-06-13 02:55:00,3052,I think its funny as all get out...you know...given the support us northerners got when we complained about the MNR closing our access roads...NO FISHING IN TORONTO...cracks me up
705304,Dara,2012-06-13 02:56:00,3052,"  It started when we let them stop the spring bear hunt, then continued with the access road closures"
705311,Acountdeleted,2012-06-13 03:11:00,2562,"Was at ""Lake Ontario Evenings"" tonight. the signs will be coming down until further notice and a further meeting by city hall.  "
705319,highdrifter,2012-06-13 04:18:00,2534,Maybe it's time I moved to another city..
705473,mepps,2012-06-13 19:11:00,1301,Ban was lifted!  http://www.torontosun.com/2012/06/12/ford-proposes-summit-on-city-s-fishing-rules
705479,Raf,2012-06-13 19:16:00,3495,"""Budget Chief Mike Del Grande demanded to know why the no-fishing signs were posted last week.  Parks general manager Jim Hart said a member of staff had a half a dozen complaints about shoreline fishing over the last number of years.  “The nature of the complaints were people fishing off the boardwalk and casting behind them while people were walking by, a line going over a boat and hitting a boater ... some seniors walking by were afraid of the lures,” Hart said.""  6 complaints over the last number of years apparently deserves a ban."
705483,Lunker777,2012-06-13 19:27:00,866,"""afraid of the lures"" ?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!!?!?!?!?!?!?!!?!?!?!?!  ....REALLY ?!?!?!"
705485,Jacob,2012-06-13 19:35:00,186,"Wow, that's obserd, why would they even consider that worthy of a banning?"
