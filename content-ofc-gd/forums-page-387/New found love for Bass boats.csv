713766,UglyBug,2012-07-11 17:45:00,148,Ok lets see if we can bring this sad excuse for a post up to a funny side  
713768,UglyBug,2012-07-11 17:46:00,148,LOL yup FR  
713773,ecmilley,2012-07-11 17:51:00,2163,"i am i still an ass when mounding glorified perch (walleye)? don't know this may qualify as the most pointless Bull thread ever. don't get it starting to think most people hate them just cause it's hard to store a white bucket in them, cause i see plenty of holes in tins, pontoons wakeboard and cruiser boats"
713774,Spiel,2012-07-11 17:56:00,9065,"Seems to me we've lost sight of the OP, good score it was for him. I've also last tackle out the back and I don't have a bass boat, just a wee tiller."
713630,lew,2012-07-11 11:04:00,12766, Why ??
713637,Stoty,2012-07-11 11:34:00,2910," No Phil, it def wasn't me, as I have respect for ALL other boaters...unlike a lot of other people out there. But... on the note of losing stuff... if anyone hooks into an HD JVC video camera ON a tripod on Rice Lake, please return it to me! LMAO!     Thanks, I appreciate that!"
713639,mercman,2012-07-11 11:42:00,7054, You lost that fishing ????? And i felt bad about losing a Tilley
713641,Stoty,2012-07-11 11:48:00,2910,"Yuppers! Last weekend! LOL  I'm used to using my GoPro's on the boat, but I forgot my laptop to unload the videos from the SD cards, so I wasnt able to use my GoPro's on the Sunday morning. So I grabbed my video camera and tripod and set it up on the back deck. Well... with GoPro's once they are in the mounts, you dont need to move them everytime you move the boat. Apparently a tripod just sitting on the back deck, needs to be removed before gunning it.... LMAO!  I heard a thump, looked back to literally see the three tripod legs slowly sinking into Rice Lake!"
713643,grimsbylander,2012-07-11 11:53:00,3016,"There sure is a lot of negative stereotyping going on here. It's not the boat it's the loose nut behind the wheel.  Assuming owners of bassboats ""should know better"" based on the fact they ""look"" like anglers is wrong. They ""look"" like anglers because they had the money to spend...or borrowed it. I will guarantee you there are anglers on this site fishing out of canoes that are better anglers.  ""I love the sound of their lower unit contacting granite"" really?? Lots of people read these posts and that comment makes no sense. I don't wish that on anybody.  Bottom line, there's a jerk or two out there in bassboats. If he sells it and buys a bowrider, he's still a jerk. I had a 30+ foot Carver weave between me and a Lund last weekend with tons of room to the outside. Nice boat, the guy is a moron.  "
713646,Stoty,2012-07-11 11:57:00,2910,Well said Grimsby! I agree that wishing people would hit their lower end is very distasteful.
713647,Harrison,2012-07-11 11:59:00,2202," My joke was made before the buzzing of boats was mentioned here, it was in regards to the plastics blowing out of the boat.  Which I have done many times I might add. Lake Simcoe has a lot of my gear, including hats, glasses, phone and a ring"
713650,Garnet,2012-07-11 12:17:00,2056,"New boat owners are the worst. Bass boat, tinny's big or small, runabouts doesn't matter the second I see idiots acting like idiots. NEW BOAT.  Canoe's out with no life jackets that's a special form of IDIOTS.  And the most special of all 20 ft wake boats on Muskoka and Lake of Bays type lakes just running around wide open kids standing up not a care in the world. Just Special."
713652,mike rousseau,2012-07-11 12:19:00,4661, I'd say that depends on the situation...  I tried to run a boat into rocks(or have him stop following me) the other day... A local angler I know was following me to find my spots...  So I ran throught a gap I knew of between some rocks... I knew he would wise up and leave me be... Or leave his lower unit... I didn't really care wich one...
713657,grimsbylander,2012-07-11 12:34:00,3016,  wow
713664,Fish Farmer,2012-07-11 12:50:00,2234," Bass boats aren't fishing boats, like most call them Bass boats, Glorified speed boats, thats all. Most only fish for Bass(glorified sunfish Rock-bass). Not saying I don't fish for Sunfish when not fishing for anything else. Look how fast I can go, are not fisherman. Don't take much skill to catch a Bass, lakes are polluted with them. But I do like to fish for Bass once-in-awhile. Seems like a lot of money spent on a boat to roar around a lake to wrench in Bass (thats not fishin). I'll stick to my tinny and fish for every species on just about any lake."
713671,grimsbylander,2012-07-11 13:08:00,3016,And the ignorance continues....
713673,johnnyb,2012-07-11 13:18:00,3413,"It's crazy how people are really hatin' on the bass boats this year.  It's a different (far more efficient, in my mind) style of fishing when you are using a bass boat.  There's no time wasted if you want to hit a bunch of spots on the lake.  You have an incredible vantage poing from the casting deck, and it's ridiculously stable.  Cruising along a weedline with the trolling motor...being able to stop, hover, back up, all without making a sound absolutely blows a tinner away. I'm not saying I'll catch more fish out of a bass boat....but I sure as heck will keep my lure in the water longer, with less effort.  No oars to pull out and muck around with....no bobbing up and down in the waves while I'm standing on the bench of my tinner. The whole speed thing really is no different than any other boat.  Who cares if you go fast....as long as you are courteous.  Are they practical for every style of fishing?  Of course not.  Should every boat out there be able to handle every kind of fishing situation?  I guess that's up to you....in my mind the answer is no.  In a perfect world I would have a nice big salmon boat for the Great Lakes.....a big deep-V for Temagami, Muskoka's big 3, etc, a bass boat for, well, BASS fishing and weekend tournaments for fun, and of course a couple tinners, one big one and one small one, light enough to drag through the woods to back lakes.  Don't forget the canoe and float tube.....maybe a kayak.....maybe.  Most of us don't have the means or selfishness to have all those boats though....so we gotta pick one or two.  Some of us pick bass boats....because yeah, bass are easy and fun to catch, and there's the challenge of pulling in a limit of all 5 pounders....and the chance of dinging a true monster, or the next Ontario record.  Look at the 6.4lb'er that was just caught on Rice....anyone who thinks that the lakes are polluted with fish like that is living in a dream world.  I've seen people keep a limit of 6 fish that wouldn't outweigh that bass.  Anyway.  I told myself I'd leave these bassboat threads alone....but you dragged it out of me    Now I have to go bail out my tinner."
713674,mercman,2012-07-11 13:25:00,7054,"Oh man:wallbash: ....................Opinions are personal and can sometimes be hurtful.Where is the filter all of us have, that tone down the hurtful opinions some of you have expressed here.  Bassboats are inanimate objects mostly driven by experienced anglers and boaters.Whether or not Bass are considered a garbage fish by some is irrelevant here. Bass fishing has become a huge sport accross N.A., and have lead to many new fishing tecnologies that all of us use today, to fish for other species.  Bass boats are not the problem.People are the problem.People will always be the problem, and that is a fact that no one can dispute.  I have been harassed by dumb:asshat: 's in a tinny and 9.9hp more than any bass boat i have encountered on any body of water.   nuff said"
713677,grimsbylander,2012-07-11 13:33:00,3016,  Extremely well done!
713679,UglyBug,2012-07-11 13:47:00,148,"Wow I am almost speechless at this thread. I cannot ever recall seeing so much hate like some are showing here. I have owned everything from small tinnies to big bass boats. I try to drive carefully around people and always show respect to others. To be clumped into the group of disrespectful boat owners is offensive to me. I have to say personally the problems I see more often than not are from party barges and jetskis but this has nothing to do with the boats but the operator's skill, competency behind the helm, and personal makeup. The simple fact is all boat owners have the capability to be great operators, or just plain dangerous operators. The boat has nothing to do with common sense, or with the long lost art of being courteous to each other. I don't wish disaster or damage to anyone, I just wish we could all respect each other and not take this nasty attitude I am starting to see on this board. I know it's a stretch but we need to re learn respect for each other all over again, before we paint a group of people with innuendo and blame....  Yes I drive a Bass Boat, and I am proud that I ama safe and respectful operator!     "
713686,Luke V.,2012-07-11 14:23:00,286,"  Agreed and well said. I have fished from a few bass boats and they definately serve their purpose and do so very well.  This has nothing to do with the style or type of boat. It has everything to do with the operator of the boat. I have been cut off/swamped by more 20-30 foot cruisers and jet skis than I have by bass boats. The worst are the  's who have the 40-50 foot house boats and think they own the water becasue they have been blesses with money. I find that anglers have more respect for others on the water than anyone else. Its those who operate the pleasure crafts I find are the worst. I live in an area where the water is very busy with all types of boaters. I see many things every time I go out that I would deam idiotic. For instance, having a jetski follow and ride your wake, cutting close behind your boat then switching to the other side. It annoys me to the point that I will stop wait for them to go past or find someone else to follow, then I will continue where I was headed.  Best thing you can do on the water is look out for yourself. Be aware of your surroundings. Keep your head up, sure you want to focus on fishing but be mindful of the others out there and keep yourself safe. When im on the water I am always looking for situations that can get ugly, large wakes, people coming to close, idiots on jet skis buzzing by. The last thing I want is to have a bad day where it can be avoided.  The pleaasure operators card is a joke. You can retake until you pass, do it online and most people will have someone else write it for them. Im all honesty, I think it should be more like getting your drivers license. Take the test, and get your begginers, ride with someone experienced. Then take some training, and get familiar will all types of watercraft. Then write a final test, along with an on the water test where knowledge and skill must be used. Then the operator card will be issued to said person. Yes it might seem rediculous, but lots of people die each year because of idiots on the water. Would this stop all of the deaths, certainly not but it would reduce the numbers."
713695,hirk,2012-07-11 14:49:00,571, wow!! Bored today farmer???? I have a bassboat and a float tube which I used for 20 yrs so I don't know if Im a fisherman or not????
713702,Stoty,2012-07-11 14:56:00,2910,This is a very informative thread....apparently:  If you own a bass boat... you're an   (and deserve to lose your lower unit) If you fish for bass..... you're an If you drive fast........ you're an  I guess I'm just an all around   then!     I'm with ya on that one!
713739,grimsbylander,2012-07-11 16:17:00,3016,"This thread is educational if nothing else. I've learned more about the biased, narrow minded, mentality of some of the members than proper boating etiquette. Somehow we went from baits flying out of a boat to trying to get other boaters to hit rocks, hoping they hit rocks, bass are easy to catch and only sunfish, and bassboats aren't even fishing boats. Good to know. I hope the guests that come to this site to learn something skip this thread."
713750,UglyBug,2012-07-11 16:52:00,148, 
713752,DRIFTER_016,2012-07-11 17:02:00,10439," 1/ Yes, if you go ripping past canoers and smaller boats without concern for their safety. 2/ Nah, if you like fishing for panfish that's fine. I have no problem with that. 3/ No problem here either as long as long as it's done safely (see response 1)  4/ If you say so."
713755,SRT8 smoker craft,2012-07-11 17:12:00,1107,Personally if a bass boat is headed in my direction I would rather they stay on the power and go right on by if they slow down the wake is way bigger as long as they stay 50+ feet away I have no problem with them buzzing by .I can't understand why people enjoy trolling for walley on the great lakes it's like reeling in a garbage bag but I would never say they aren't fisherman because they choose to fish this way .I would think bass is likely the most pressured fish in most lakes because the smaller ones are almost suicidal and will hit just about anything but the big ones are hard to come by and to consitantly catch big bass takes a lot of skill and knowledge just like catching any fish of above average size not everyone can do it .
713762,Stoty,2012-07-11 17:24:00,2910," 1) You dont have to be in a ""bass boat"" to do that.... I've been ""buzzed"" tons of times by tinnies and cruisers. 2) Doesn't even deserve a response.... 3) See response #1 4) Did my wife tell you to write that?!    Point is... doesnt matter what type of boat you drive. If you're as    behind the wheel... you're an   behind the wheel!"
713765,mercman,2012-07-11 17:42:00,7054,"  My brother and i have a special name for those types of people. And believe me, they are absolutely everywhere you can think of too."
713358,esoxansteel,2012-07-10 16:53:00,1307,"Was out on Rice lake Sunday fishing for Walleyes with bouncers and gulp leeches, when a Nitro Bass boat with a 225 optimax blew by me blowing multiple packs of plastic out the back of his boat, there was no way my 60 was going to catch the 225, so I kindly went around scooping up 7 packs in all that i could find, so along with 9 walleyes it turned into a great day on the water."
713360,tb4me,2012-07-10 17:01:00,3295,lol funny..Cool find!
713366,fish_fishburn,2012-07-10 17:09:00,1311,"Awesome, them bass boats have a way of loosing stuff. Lost lots of hats clothing etc out of mine but its mostly guests that loose their stuff. Cameras, lunch etc."
713368,Harrison,2012-07-10 17:11:00,2202,Wasn't dark coloured with gold stripes with a guy smilin gear to ear behind the wheel like he just boated a 6 and change was it?
713373,Dontcryformejanhrdina,2012-07-10 17:18:00,535,"Funny you mentioned that, I was fishing with a guy I know through work yesterday and he lost a bunch of tackle when a tray from his tackle box blew back and hit the motor and opened up, thankfully I was able to grab his tray before he lost the entire thing and we we able to find about 5-6 more lures floating on the surface. I definitely don't have a bass boat though haha, gotta have things secured pretty damn well in those things. I once found a hat of a guy I know a day after he lost it, about 2 miles down the river from where it blew off his head lol."

713416,tb4me,2012-07-10 18:45:00,3295,Funny Lew that same jerk passed me on the trent this weekend past..Its a good thing those bass boats dont have a huge wake..I was in my 14 foot tinner..Had another boat cut both my daughter and my lines while trolling too..Not a good weekend out there.....  Neeless to say I was pissed
713521,esoxansteel,2012-07-10 22:52:00,1307,"  No it wasnt Mr 6 and change, but that was one hell of a nice fish, and one of the bigger ones ive seen from their in a few years for sure."
713528,mike rousseau,2012-07-10 23:09:00,4661, He got you too...?  Him and his buddies got me on the Larry... He really gets around...  Then his 20-30 foot cruiser buddies joined the family reunion... I could hardly keep a straight line trolling...
713531,Ron,2012-07-10 23:19:00,1683,"Was out on RIce on Sunday as well. A bass boat, red &white stratos with a 175 merc, came so close to a canoe they jumped ship in fear of being hit by the boat. The idiot turned around and started to ream them out for being in the middle of the lake in a canoe. By the time I got to them, there were needless to say many words exchanged. The idiot in the bass boat didn't stick around to help them right the canoe, probably a good thing as that would have put me close enough to his boat and I might not be able to report this as I would be in jail right now on manslaughter.  I brought the canoe up over my boat to get the water out, let the 3 kids climb into my boat and re board the canoe.  WHAT""S WITH SOME PEOPLE???"
713532,mercman,2012-07-10 23:19:00,7054,"Just remember, its not the boat, its the driver.For every out there, there are 10 good courteous boaters on the water."
713540,Dutch,2012-07-10 23:42:00,831,Reminds me of the numerous times Ive been fishing the many laydowns along the banks of the Otonabee when some guy in a big ALUMINUM boat with a 60 or 90 goes plowing by barely on plane cause he doesnt even know what plane is in a tinner.  The huge unnessary wake always pushes my bassboat too close to the bank ruining my presentation.  Being courteous goes both ways. It is NOT the type of boat that dictates the common sense or lack thereof of the captain.  Just sayin.....
