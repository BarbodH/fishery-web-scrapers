713802,asdve23rveavwa,2012-07-11 18:50:00,2690,"Gargantuan laker.  Congrats on an amazing catch, and, good luck with the replica mount!!"
713814,I'mHooked,2012-07-11 19:14:00,525,"Come on, tell us...you pee'd a little right?  Beauty laker!"
713824,esoxansteel,2012-07-11 19:55:00,1307,"A true Giant, congradulations on a memory of a lifetime, a replica would be sweet, if it comes to be post a pic of the rep as well, I am sure you have lots of great pictures, so you have all the time in the world to butter up to your wife for a replica.  Start by taking her to the Keg for a steak and wine dinner, that usually softens them up, at least it works for me"
713825,Spiel,2012-07-11 19:57:00,9065,"Absolute tank Anders, perhaps you'll never best it, but my wish to you is you spend a great deal of time trying and hopefully someday succeeding!"

713691,anders,2012-07-11 14:37:00,1168,"I recently went on a fishing trip that i have dreamed of for years and the fishing was great but the trophy was nothing what i expected.  I was thinking of fish in the 20lbs class but not this.  this fish took about 30-35 min to bring in, a fight that was pretty much a stand still for a good 25 min of it, on 14 lb test line, fishing off a rigger 71 ft down.  truly a trophy and a relic.  My father in law took this pic of me half way through the tug of war   Here it is 44 long x 29 wide   Another   And the result of the hook during the battle.  This spoon is officially retired   "

713763,anders,2012-07-11 17:38:00,1168,"thanks guys.  I got that out on Lake Superior this past weekend.  i have been reliving it every day since.  i already have an 8x10 done and am working on my wife for a replica.  whatever i get that spoon is going with either the picture or the replica.  on the water i said it was damn near 50 but after a few beer and disussions around dinner in the 40's for sure, father in law said 45"
