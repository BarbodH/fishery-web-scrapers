All of a sudden the motor has started to run really high rpms. In neutral you would think the throttle is at full and while in forward and reverse it is the same. In forward it it going probably 8kmh at the slowest you can.  Any ideas what may cause this?  Thanks"
714003,UglyBug,2012-07-12 16:40:00,148,Sounds like the throttle linkage is stuck somewhere and its not letting the carbs return to there idle location. Check to see if the throttle has any restrictions preventing it from returning to the idle postion.
