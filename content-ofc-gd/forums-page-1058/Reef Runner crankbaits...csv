180925,Billy - Curtiss,2008-04-03 15:16:00,241,"In the next day or two, I'm planning on doing a ridiculous amount of online shopping through the Bass Pro website in preparation for the season ahead. Recently, I've read a lot about Reef Runner crankbaits slaying walleye en masse. Does anyone have any input on the quality/efficiency of these lures? Should I go for the Ripstick? How do they fare when targeting other species like pike, bass and trout? Any insight would be greatly appreciated."
180934,bbog,2008-04-03 15:38:00,665,We've had decent success using Reef Runners in BOQ for Wallys. Haven't tried them on any other species or had any incidental catches.
180935,trapshooter,2008-04-03 15:38:00,1234,"They have their time and place for multi-species angling.  Some walleye fisheries seem to favour the reef runners while others claim the Taildancer or DeepDiving Huskey Jerk or (insert crankbait brand here) work best.  I have a few of them but I don't swear by them, by any means, but I'm sure some people do.  I'd rather have a broad selection of different brands of minnowbaits/stickbaits/crankbaits then just ALL Reef Runners.  That's my 2cents."
180937,OhioFisherman,2008-04-03 15:44:00,6623,"Tools, like Ben says better a well rounded inventory than heavy on one unless it is a proven winner for you.  When my dad was young flatfish were the lure of choice for Lake Erie walleye and blue pike, when I fished for them back in the late 70`s early 80`s on Erie a wiggle wart or hot n tot was hard to beat.  Key is probably more to depth control, stick a lure in their face = more bites."
180939,BFSC Kevin,2008-04-03 15:45:00,1351,"yup.  them reef runners work well! too bad you just missed the sale at bps for the reef runners, $20 for 5.  sometimes these lures don't run correctly, so you might have to fiddle around with it.  i've only used the deep diver ones, didnt tried the ripstick ones.. sorry about that"
180941,capt bruce,2008-04-03 15:47:00,820,"Reefrunners are good tail dancers are also , heard good things about the shad rap x-raps gonna give them a try , good old shad raps have their days , worm harness , etc. etc. there is no one bait for eyes all have their uses . But ya reefrunners are good get a few in different colors (purple has been good in the sping for me but try different colors for different days ) and give them a go"
180942,Tomcat,2008-04-03 15:49:00,395," Various Reef Runner models work at different depths. According to Precision Trolling, the Ripstick can be trolled down to 11 feet. If that's your target depth, fine. If you anticipate working other depths, you probably should consider other Reef Runner models or other brands of crankbaits."
180944,cranks bait,2008-04-03 15:54:00,721,"I have a white deep diving reef runner that has really performed well with catching pike, walleye, and bass.  I believe it is the 4-5 inch model.  Trolling I can hit 30 feet at 2-2.5 miles.  I have tried several other lures but this is the one that outdoes them all."
180945,Reef Runner,2008-04-03 15:56:00,981,"Is this directed to me? lol  My boss' says I do exellent work around here and I catch an assortment of fish every year.  lol.  Seriously though, reefrunners are very good crankbaits that have a distinctive wobble to them that walleye can't resist.  But as was mentioned, there are alot of cranks to choose from and the ripstick should only be part of your arsenal.  I have had success targeting pike with them in the past, casting adjacent to weed beds to intice those ambushing brutes burried in there.  Also, try casting along a wind swept shorline.  Another bonus is that the action of the bait has a metronome ""feel"" to it that if you notice it skip a beat good chances you got a strike.  reefrunner"
180947,Reef Runner,2008-04-03 15:57:00,981,"Oh, also remember talking to someone swearing by them for ice out lakers"
180948,Roy,2008-04-03 15:59:00,13728,"Reefrunners are great. Ripsticks don't run as deep so I don't use them very often for walleye. They both work well with other species however, if you're running into pike you'll need a leader and that'll all but kill the action."
180967,bucktail,2008-04-03 17:17:00,1857,Good lure on quinte and erie for eyes but as Kevin has mentioned i find they need alot of tuning coming out of the package. I usually am lazy and grab a taildancer as they usually run truer. But thats me being lazy!
180974,Gerritt,2008-04-03 17:46:00,6129,Dont forget the Manns!  G
180977,Fishnfiend,2008-04-03 17:52:00,357,"I used to slay the spring salmon on Lake O with 'em...wonder bread pattern - hand painted over brand new silver, gold, etc.  They worked that good!"
180978,Fang,2008-04-03 17:54:00,1330,"Reef runners do work well but I have found that most need some tuning out of the package. Without further details as far as what body of water, time of year here's my 2 cents on crankbaits for walleye as I could be considered a bit of an addict if you saw my boxes - who doesn't like a good crankbait!!!!  In larger body of water like GB and LO I have had better catch ratio with minnow baits as follows cold water, spring and fall   >>>    slimmer baits like reef runners, renoskys, Yozuris. bombers long a, manns warm water periods            >>>   bigger shad and perch style bodies perform better, Shad Raps my fave  For inland lakes like the Kawarthas I add fat body baits in the summer too like Fat raps, bombers and   Don't ask colors as you'll get as many opinions as there are reef runner colours"
180996,corvette1,2008-04-03 18:22:00,1765,i run ripsticks along weed edges at night i have cought walleyes 14lbs bass 6lbs musky 48inch 29lbs i use deepdivers at quinte i guess you could say i like reefrunners
181104,walleyemen,2008-04-03 22:25:00,316,"Reef runners were smoking for me in lake ontario last spring for lakers , the bare naked was the most productive, although the storm thunder sticks were pretty good as well."
181132,fishindevil,2008-04-03 23:27:00,6254,"Yes runners rock for sure !!!!   theres the smaller deep diver runners as well and they dive to around 15-20ft and in medium sized lakes for walleyes man they work great,the larger size is my quinte favourite,but you have to try several colors and the 2 sizes so pick up a few of each,and make sure you get some natural colors for fishing the clear lakes !!!!    cheers"
181187,eye-tracker,2008-04-04 00:14:00,89,You always have to tune a reef runner. I have never seen one run 'in-tune' out of the box. The odd kick they make out to the side is what makes them magic for walleye.  -sheldon
181190,Casey123,2008-04-04 00:15:00,461,"We love them, clownand wonder bread have been great for us in the F R Basin."
181434,Marc Thorpe,2008-04-04 11:43:00,621,"Reef Runners come in all flavors,thems all delicious Ben pointed out the true nature of crank baits and fisheries I will say,my fishery enjoys Reef Runners,it actually out fishes all other cranks,why I am still perplexed but I gave in  I'll take a pink lemonade with Fried Chicken on Wonder Bread with Blueberry Muffin for desert while wearing my Cheap Sunglasses under the Blue Hawaiian sun"
181438,brickNblock,2008-04-04 11:50:00,598," Dont forget these babies either.  Also, This past winter on the BOQ saw many more hits on all Gold, Pink or Orange w/a lil red on the belly. bNb"
181576,Billy - Curtiss,2008-04-04 15:16:00,241,Thanks for all the input gang! I've never tinkered with readjusting lures fresh out of the box to make them run more true. What does this consist of? Is it mainly messing around with the lip? Changing the angle?
181798,walleyemen,2008-04-04 20:15:00,316,"Bill you have to tune the eye you tye to on the lip,bending it left , right what ever, tie it on and see how it trails threw the water then tweak it to run true, not very difficult, just a pain somtimes, but neccessary."
