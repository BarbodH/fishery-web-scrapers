Every year  there are a few more log jams, slowing down the current.  A few more trees that have fallen over the stream.  The net result is a slower flow, warmer temperatures, more suspened particulate and less oxygen.  How would I go about fixing this?  Should i try and get a local conservation group involved or should I speak to the MNR?  Are there laws against removing log jams via a chain saw?  If you have ever fished this river, you will know just how pretty it is...I am more then wiling to spend a few weekends to cut out some log jams."

181228,kickingfrog,2008-04-04 00:59:00,8333,"Yes, there are laws regarding what can be done in and around streams. The Nottawasaga Valley Conservation Authority NVCA and the MNR are where you should start. There is a local steelheaders association as well. Not all stream clean-up is ""good"" for the stream or the wildlife associated with it however."
