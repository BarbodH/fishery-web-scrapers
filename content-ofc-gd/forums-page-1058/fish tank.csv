I remember the day that they were brought in............HUGE HAWGS!!  I couldn't wait to see them in the tank, but like I said earlier, they get put in quarantine for quite some time before they're introduced to the big tank."
180432,Cory,2008-04-02 16:34:00,170,Check out the colour difference from a Detroit River pickerel to one caught on say….BOQ.  Big difference in colour due to their environment…..  And we all know that Roger is very knowledgeable…..that is why I make sure to stop and talk to him every time I’m there.
180445,fishindevil,2008-04-02 17:13:00,6254,"Great info roger,very interesting question too,im sure it takes alot of time & MONEY !!!  to keep a tank like that running,and have all the proper elements in place,plus a biologist 3 times a week,im glad that that tank is there,  and its great to see them all swimming around,and my little daughter just loves it when we go there its all she talks about for a day or 2 after....great thread,on fish color,cant wait to hear more info....cheers"
180453,bpsbassman,2008-04-02 17:22:00,941," Hey Cory, I will definitely buy you a coffee next time your in the store"
180506,Spiel,2008-04-02 18:53:00,9065,"....Sheesh, you're never around when I've been in Roger. But I  do appreciate you taking the time to respond with the facts on that big aquarium."
180616,Rattletrap2,2008-04-02 21:35:00,1652,"Great info Roger! That aquarium always holds my attention whenever I am in the store as well. I do know that the store takes the care of these fish very seriously too.  I think you really nailed it when you said that this is the only opportunity some folks get to see these fish up close and personal and are allowed the chance to dream!  Thanks again, and hope to see you in there one of these days soon."
180631,Burtess,2008-04-02 22:09:00,901,"I would be interested to know what water parameters they maintain there.  I would assume they use city water without altering the hardness values, but would be most interested in what their water change regime is (do they have a continuous flow of treated city water in) and what they maintian their nitrate levels below.  Burt"
180805,David Chong,2008-04-03 03:48:00,836,"Having been an aquarium hobbyist for most of my life and for a good part of it dealing with marine creatures, I think that the folks at BPS and Chris do a great job looking after those fish. The filtration system, chillers and other equipment used in the operation of the tank are all top notch! It rates right up there with systems that I have seen at many world class aquariums. The water is kept with tolerable ranges for all the fish that inhabit the BPS tank! The fish in there certainly eat like they're healthy.  Roger, great investigative reporting! Keep up the good work! Cheers, Dave"
180806,JerseyDog,2008-04-03 04:16:00,190,"I get maybe 100 days on the water every year and to be honest, sometimes it feels like the only time I see any of Ontario's fish species is when I'm at BPS.  It's also my favourite part of the store (and its free)."
