178997,2 tone z71,2008-03-30 19:49:00,1311,"anybody got /use one of these fish n grip weigh things ,almost bought one yesterday thought id check the councils advise first http://www.berkley-fishing.com/prod.php?k=...9555&u=BGLG"
179131,grt1,2008-03-30 23:54:00,638,"I have one of the berkley grippers and I got a rapala gripper too. the berkley is just a grabber and doesn't have the scale but the rapala does. I like the idea of being able to weigh the bigger fish but the jaws on the rapala are very hard to keep open and grab the fish with. I would not like to handle big northerns without one of these on board because once the thing shuts, it is extremely hard to lose a fish."
179154,Ramble,2008-03-31 00:33:00,713,Those things are hard on big fish.
179155,irishfield,2008-03-31 00:34:00,26272,If you're gonna use one.. make sure it has a swivel head.
179165,muskymike,2008-03-31 01:02:00,772,"I like these if they are used properly, for musky and pike tho, they should only be used to help guide the fish and not to hoist it.  PROPER LIFT and RELEASE.  Please if you do get one and are planning on using it for Musky, learn how to use it properly. DO NOT WEIGH the fish with it.  "
179175,mikeh,2008-03-31 01:25:00,824,"I bought a cheaper one and the grip is not so good, If I was going to get another I would buy the better one with better grip. Also one with the swivel head."
179219,2 tone z71,2008-03-31 02:39:00,1311,"thanks fellas maybe ill get one for my bassin and walleye ,I thought I could use it for the skis but ok I see where this is going lol"
179225,muskymike,2008-03-31 02:52:00,772,"haha 2Tone, just go spend the $$$ on a Frabill or Beckman. They are worth every penny. I have a Frabill big game but wishing I bought a Beckman."
179227,troutologist,2008-03-31 02:53:00,951," Agreed, also found trying to grab the fish at boatside a challenge, easier to grab then figure the gripper out. The only real use I found was to use as a handle for people who were inexperienced handling fish. I could see the salt water application for toothy fish with bony mouths."
179232,2 tone z71,2008-03-31 03:08:00,1311, Hey Mike ya got a link to the Beckman
179234,trapshooter,2008-03-31 03:11:00,1234, Right on Ramble.  Can you imagine what they'd say at Kesagami if a guide tried to use one of those to land/hold/weigh a big pike?!?!
179244,muskymike,2008-03-31 03:22:00,772,"Here ya go 2Tone  http://www.beckmannet.com/  Check out JB's or Pro Tackle in Corbyville. Talk to Stacy there, he is great.  If not, have a look at the Frabills, they only thing I wish I would have got was smaller mesh size. just easier to work with. My hooks NEVER get caught in the big hoops, just my preference.  Good luck and let me know what ya get."
179352,Ramble,2008-03-31 14:45:00,713,"Ben, A new guide brought one a scale last year, and there was almost a riot lolol  I had a fly-fisherman going for a world record at one point (cath and release) and he had permission to weigh only fish that might be close enough to the mark. Even then i rigged up a string for my cradle so i could weigh the fish horizontally, while it was supported.  They shouldnt be allowed to weigh them by the gill or lip or tail unless they are dead...those practices on trouphy fish can be a death sentance.  -R-"
181237,2 tone z71,2008-04-04 01:13:00,1311, HEY Mike I got a HUGH Beckman Magnum XD Fin saver this week from Tight lines LOVE IT good god if I catch a Muskie that fills this bag damm
181244,Casey123,2008-04-04 01:21:00,461,"Not great for fish.  There are great weight calculators, you can get the length and girth without hanging a fish by its jaw.   Just my Humble Opinion - not passing judgement"
181255,muskymike,2008-04-04 01:31:00,772," Nice, I am kinda Jealous. My Frabill Big Game is great and all, but I would have opted for the Beckman Now. I know what you mean by huge, the 42""er i caught in the fall was the first to have the pleasure to meet this net and it looked like a fry in it haha.  If I see ya trollin in the Baril area I will stop by and say hello, maybe team up and get something to fill either of the nets.  What size hoop did ya get?"
181363,sharper,2008-04-04 03:58:00,279,"Learned lesson hard way as well, spend more the first time to get a good one."
