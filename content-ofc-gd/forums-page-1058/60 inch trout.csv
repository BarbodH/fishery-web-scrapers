180418,ch312,2008-04-02 15:52:00,1590,i remember when i was a kid my dad had a fishing magazine with an article about catching giant trout using dead squirrels as bait. i thought they were lake trout or something but i guess this must have been the same kind of fish in that article. this was 10 years ago or more...
180429,Lakeshore,2008-04-02 16:19:00,56,"Awesome. Correct me if I am wrong, but those look a lot like Brown Trout, or are they something completely different."
180433,fishindevil,2008-04-02 16:36:00,6254,"Man thats pretty amazing stuff,it sure would be cool to fish for them,how do i get to mongolia ????"

180636,Ramble,2008-04-02 22:17:00,713,On my student budget I can't afford to dream lololol
180645,Musky or Specks,2008-04-02 22:29:00,2710,"Your a guide arent you. When I was a student I spent one summer working as a tech for the Alaskan DNR, doing spawning surveys in the remote wilderness didn't pay worth a crap but it was a trip of a lifetime."
180804,John Bacon,2008-04-03 03:40:00,3277," They are a different genus (Hucho) than brown trout which are classified in the Salmo genus along with atlantic salmon.  Base on this, in don't think they are too closely related to browns despite their similar appearance."
