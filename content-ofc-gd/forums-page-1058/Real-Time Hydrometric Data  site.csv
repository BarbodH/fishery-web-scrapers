Check it out if you wann see how high the water levels are on your favourite river.  And YES, i know they are all REAL HIGH today.   http://scitech.pyr.ec.gc.ca/waterweb/formNav.asp"

180505,ccmtcanada,2008-04-02 18:53:00,7971,I use this all the time.  Just keep a close look at those time indexes...sometimes there is a lag of a full day...other times it's only a few hours off.
