181384,jediangler,2008-04-04 04:48:00,1923,"It would be nice to see a Habs vs Bruins game sometime. Truth is, the Montreal Museum of Fine Art was the reason for both my trips there. Here's a link for some of Montreals finest.  http://www.montreal.com/tourism/museums.html"

181612,fishing n autograph,2008-04-04 16:04:00,2540,"well, we've got the place we're stay....it's a small b+b in Old Montreal...looks really nice and has rave reviews...it's a block from Ste Catherine's....so we'll be hanging out down there. My wife has spent time down there but I haven't....closest i've been to Montreal was Ottawa...."
181646,Puckhead,2008-04-04 16:50:00,377,Club super contact.... hahaha...
181698,walleyejigger,2008-04-04 17:47:00,876, I AGREE
181746,Roy,2008-04-04 18:48:00,13728,"It's called ""Chez Paré"" actually but what the heck do I know....the women who were there when I was there 30 years ago are probably all in the home right now getting their drool bibs changed every hour."
181855,jjcanoe,2008-04-04 21:38:00,744,Best thing to do in Montreal is not drive anywhere.  Walking or taxi or transit is the way to go.  OK I might be a bit jaded from trying to drive a tractor with a 53' trailer around there.  jjcanoe
181087,fishing n autograph,2008-04-03 22:00:00,2540,"Hey Guys,  The wife and I are heading to Montreal next week for a little getaway. I'm just wondering about things to do, sightseeing wise. Any suggestions?  Thanks,  Dave"
181089,Gerritt,2008-04-03 22:03:00,6129,Sooo... you get your wife... Alone.. for a couple days... and your wondering about sight seeing??!!??  I would not be leaving the room except to get more beer and wine...  having a 2 year old does that to a fella I guess...   G
181090,irishfield,2008-04-03 22:03:00,26272,Out for diner and the Himalayya's.. can't think of much else to do in Montreal.
181091,KyleM,2008-04-03 22:05:00,218,Go to a Habs game with a Sens jersey on.
181092,Deano,2008-04-03 22:07:00,767,"Take a ride up top to Mount Royal, Great view. Check out St. Joseph's Oratory, it's an amazing structure even if your not religious. Go for a Smoked Meat Sandwich at one of the many restaurants, and a Lafleur's Fry is also a treat. Lot's to do there, those are some of my favorites from Montreal."
181095,ccmtcanada,2008-04-03 22:08:00,7971,Rue Sainte Catherine...oh wait...you said you were going with your wife...scratch that.....hehe.
181096,douG,2008-04-03 22:08:00,2693,"I always have dinner at Roy's place, and have a nice chat with J.  If it's a sunny afternoon, some of the nicest scenery in the nation can be found on Rue Ste. Catherine."
181097,fishing n autograph,2008-04-03 22:10:00,2540, Yup we're already going to st josephs....gonna go pray for a miracle...no not the Leafs winning the cup...i just want my old wife back lol
181099,Gerritt,2008-04-03 22:12:00,6129,Ahhhhh yes... I forgot about that.... Do what she wants to do...... tell her to get on the net and do some research and pick some places she would like to visit... might help?  G
181101,Deano,2008-04-03 22:14:00,767,"""If it's a sunny afternoon, some of the nicest scenery in the nation can be found on Rue Ste. Catherine.""  Doesn't really matter what day or what time, the streets are busy even at 3:00am. Ste. Catherine will take care of a few hours to just cruise down, a good variety of all walks of life."
181106,wallyboss,2008-04-03 22:27:00,1095,I would go down to Old Montreal instead of walking down St.Catherines.  Just not sure about this time of year.  Might want to drive a bit out of the city and go experience A Quebecois Sugar Shack  especially if you have sweet tooth.
181112,Roy,2008-04-03 22:38:00,13728,When are you coming down Dave and for how long?
181113,holdfast,2008-04-03 22:39:00,1813,"Go to old Montreal and take her for a Carriage Ride.  Make sure Kramer isn't the driver.  Definitely take the Metro just for the Experience and stop at St Catherine's or University street.  I would shop on the South Shore Tashereau Blvd.  Start at the Champlain Mall.  Being a Cop you might find St Helene's Island interesting I believe there is a fort there.  If not Fort Chambly is interesting.  You Can also check out Lebarons.  For food you got to try the Cheap steamed hotdogs.  Submarines ie Vincents or the Belle Province Restaurants.  Chinoys makes a great smoked Meat sandwhich.  Go to a Movie theatre on St Catherines, I say that because mingle with the people.  Other than that, My experiences are the Skin Bars"
181145,douG,2008-04-03 23:41:00,2693,"Skin Bars?  Ahh yes, Le Ballet National du Quebec."
181161,mistyriver1,2008-04-03 23:53:00,600,"Lots to do............ beautiful city.   If you like ribs, go to a place called the Bar B Barn.  Excellent ribs and bring your business card.  You'll know what I mean if you've been there.  I'm assuming it's still there."
181165,fishindevil,2008-04-03 23:58:00,6254,"How about hooking up with mike the pike,and maybe going fishing if theres anything open down that way yet ??  check out the huge rapids right nearby,with all the thaw we have had man i bet they are going full tilt !!!! have a nice trip,and show us some pics when you get back...cheers"
181171,Tarzan's Jane,2008-04-04 00:04:00,1183,I loved Old Montreal...the little shops...the pier...and of course a few hours at the Casino.  The peeler clubs were entertaining...some hot guys there  haha...and of course Smoke Meat...you gotta have some of that.  And don't be a cop okay...if you are anything like my son...your eyes are all over the place...relax with her and have a great time.
181179,Gerritt,2008-04-04 00:11:00,6129,.........  G
181188,fishing n autograph,2008-04-04 00:14:00,2540, Just for 3 days...11th-13th...we're driving up early on the 11th...bout 5.5-6 hours from where we are....
181193,Roy,2008-04-04 00:21:00,13728,"Gerritt, I have no idea what you're talking about, sorry. I just checked the admin logs and all I saw was that you had locked/unlocked/locked/unlocked a thread in the tourney forum.  Dave....if you want to get together for dinner, Friday or Saturday would be good. Pm me if you want any info at all."
181216,douG,2008-04-04 00:47:00,2693,"See how easy that was?  You can make it up to me later, FA."
181217,preload420,2008-04-04 00:49:00,3,hey if your in montreal  theres a bar called   le bar dianne  or something pretty close its the only place you can get the big 700 ml  beers for 5 bucks and well the crowd that hangs out there will be all the entertainment you need   trust me .     and if you need a place to crash the guy upstairs will let you use the floor   othere than that i dont really remember much of montreal
181221,danc,2008-04-04 00:53:00,4677,My first propriety would be to hook up with Roy.
181229,LundGuy,2008-04-04 01:01:00,169,"Was born and played hockey in Montreal, most my family is still there. Too much to mention, but here are some of the sites you should try to see if you are touring about.  If you are a hockey fan you can take the tour of the Bell Center.You can visit the old site from Expo 67 and see Olympic Stadium with the Montreal Tower, you can go up 575 feet and look over the city. Take a stroll on the boardwalk along the St Lawrence River,if its warm enough. Walk  up from Peel St to Mount Royal to Mount Royal Park and over look the city. Visit the market downtown,just outside Verdun.Definitely go to Vieux-Montréal (Old Montréal) and see Notre-Dame Basilica, inside is just unbelievable, also in Old Montreal there are shops, restaurants and more.Last you can visit the under ground city, hundreds of shops and resturants there, just follow the subway."
181302,Baptiste,2008-04-04 02:15:00,37,"If you have a rainy day the Biodome is a must. They converted the olympic cycling dome into 4 eco systems, from tropical rainforests to the Artic. All kinds of unusual wildlife but my favorites are the Canadian Shield with live Lynx, otters and a duck pond etc. and the St. Lawrence Seaway, with tide pools and underwater viewing areas. When you look at the water from the rocks above you see giant sturgeon and salmon everywhere while gulls fly overhead. Unfortunately fishing is frowned upon. The rain forest is great on a winter day with monkeys, birds, crocodiles and all kinds of tropical fish and the Artic area is just like the rest of Montreal 10 months a year except for the penguins and puffins.  . There is also an Insectarium across the park, seperate admission...a little creepy for most wives but a beautiful butterfly garden."
