180904,DANIMAL,2008-04-03 14:25:00,215,"The other day someone told me that I am supposed to have a passport and check in with customs to boat into american waters.  Example: I launch on the Ontario side of the Niagara, boat over and fish a NY drift, boat back over to Ontario and unlaunch. Do I need a passport and to check in with customs to do this, and if so how would I go about checking in with customs?"
180908,LeXXington,2008-04-03 14:28:00,1928,When crossing that border anytime always have the paper work.. The American's at the border have no sense of humor
180913,rhare,2008-04-03 14:43:00,387,"I dont think you need a passport, a drivers license would do along with another form of id. A passport is just easier. you also need a NY state fishing license to fish the American side. The coast guard boat patrols the river and checks up I believe. you dont always get checked but it happens. Im sure some others could give you more info.Cast Adventures perhaps?"
180918,Whopper,2008-04-03 14:54:00,2174,"To answer your question you either need a passport or a picture ID and birth certificate.  We we warned by the border patrol last season nurmerous times that they would be inforcing this year.  And yes we are being told that one has to check in and out here in Ohio. I'll try to find another link that explains it better, but the following is an overview.  They never made an issue over it before as long as you never left the water but things change.  http://www.uscis.gov/files/pressrelease/Ca...Land_040902.pdf"
180920,DANIMAL,2008-04-03 15:00:00,215,"I have my NY liscence, only been checked once by the DEC on Buffalo harbour about 2 years ago. He only asked for my liscence, but I heard now they want you to check into customs.  Thanks for the responses."
180936,capt bruce,2008-04-03 15:39:00,820,"Be smart radio customs at the harbor when or if you want to go ashore and do what they say ,have alot of ID(a passport is the best) and a NY york liscence if you just stay in the river . Before 9 11 we never had any trouble and I would gas up in youngstown all the time (twin 440's eat alot of gas and I have 2 250 gallon tanks ) pay my money shoot the st*t and go . After  9 11 I was off the bar in the fog (Im sure I didnt go past the black bouy ) I was hailed to pull up , as I didnt think I had crossed and was just up to plane I didnt stop , as I was for sure in Canada I (first stupid misstake)just turned off the radio and vawoom headed to Niagra on the lake at about 35 knots (second missstake I thought I was going FAST) I was still thinking what are these idiots doing IM in canada they have no rights HERE (BIGGEST MISSTAKE ) To shorten A long story we were arreasted at the dock at GUN POINT by the americans , and when the mounties showed up it just got worse alot worse glad IM white and had some resourses  or it was off to GITMO for me. I never fish the bar or the river WITHOUT MY PASSPORT WITH ME , never go ashore (not that they would let me ) and allways have a NY linscence for everyone aboard . BELIEVE ME IT AINT WORTH IT to do otherwise .."
180938,Raf,2008-04-03 15:44:00,3495,"As of Jan 31st/2008 you need proof of (cdn) citizenship (ie. passport, birth cert or canadian citizenship card) and valid photo ID (ie. driver's license) to cross by land or sea.  Passports are not (yet) required, only by air.  They are being lenient to a degree.. I am sure it depends on the mood of the border guards."
180962,DANIMAL,2008-04-03 16:47:00,215,"I'll get a passport, sounds like it will make things easyer if I ever get checked again.  Thank for all the info."
180985,Seaweed,2008-04-03 18:02:00,135,"When fishing the St. Lawrence we have been warned to have a lot of stuff on hand because you will be stopped and will be asked for everything that they want.  Here is some of a discussion that I found on this from the Renegade.com site in Ottawa.  ""If you plan on fishing any American water you need a NY license and I would recommend getting the I-68.  The I-68 is NOT required. I got confirmation from the US customer officers last year at the US border when I purchased by I-68 back in September. With that said, if you get stopped in US waters fishing, having the I-68 form greatly speeds up the check. If you don't have the form, the officers will take there time and fill out their forms with your information. I was stopped 3 years ago on the St.Lawrence during a tournament and my partner and I didn't have an I-68 and we weren't able to fish for 45 minutes. There was never an issue of being charged or anything like that but they requested our driver's license and fishing license. They fill out a couple of forms and also checked that we had all our boat safety equipment. This raises another point, in the US boats are required to carry flares. They simplied warned us and finally let us get back to fishing. In Ontario/Canada this isn't required for the size of boat we had.  My recommendation is, if you are going to fish US waters ensure you have the appropiate fishing license (that should be a given), get an I-68 and also make sure you have all the satefy equipment required for both Canadian and US waters. If you have all this and are stopped, the stop shouldn't take more than 5 minutes. """
180987,charlied,2008-04-03 18:09:00,584,if you launch on canadian soil and just fish the US side all you need is your NY state fishing licence.  You only need to check in with customs if you step onto US soil.  But you should have valid photo ID just in case.

181182,forrest,2008-04-04 00:11:00,1032,"If there is sensitive cargo (gas, oil....) being shipped nearby you are getting checked.  How will you know there is sensitive cargo close?  You probably won't.  forrest"
