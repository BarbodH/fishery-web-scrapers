180236,FishFinder,2008-04-02 01:55:00,481,Will I still be eligable for an at cost TV?
180238,Gerritt,2008-04-02 01:58:00,6129,Sorry I reserve my generosity to those I deem to be deserving. Besides... I'd probably just carp about helping you out....   G
180243,Gerritt,2008-04-02 02:03:00,6129,Still waiting on you to elaborate further on your comment about my character...Especially from a guy who has never met me.....  G.
180249,Greencoachdog,2008-04-02 02:07:00,8163,
180254,Gerritt,2008-04-02 02:09:00,6129,Hahahahahahhaaa! Thanks Dawg I needed a laugh  G
180274,bucktail,2008-04-02 02:49:00,1857,At least he isnt lipping it!
180286,jediangler,2008-04-02 03:26:00,1923,Great pic. I find if you stick your tongue out you get a much better grip on the pike. 
180294,Black_Blade,2008-04-02 04:33:00,258,"I still remember my mom holding pike like that.  It used to give me the willies, cuz I swear her thumb and finger must have been touching, she was gripping them so hard...lol.  Needless to say those fish didn't do much thrashing around (maybe that was the reason she did it...)"
180306,Dano,2008-04-02 10:01:00,719,Isnt that Brangelinas new kid?
180309,pikehunter,2008-04-02 10:10:00,1659,Ah crap....you just hold 'em by the ears... like a bunny.
180352,Moosebunk,2008-04-02 12:48:00,3970,"I've fished with a few northern Ontario fellas in my time that hold pike the same way.  Not so uncommon up this way either.  Sometimes fish are kept, sometimes just thrown on shore to help control the walleye populations.  It's old school, sure is.  Even for a three year old Mongolian or Inuit child."
180357,Stoty,2008-04-02 12:58:00,2910, LOL
180368,brickNblock,2008-04-02 13:30:00,598,"I think everyone is missing out on something.... To me that doesnt look at all like an Inuit, Nunavit or Mongolian little fella... More like an Inuit, Nunavik or Mongolian little girl. Check out the hairline! Makes sense to me.... When my wife is ugly mad towards me and/or the kids she GRABS US BY THE EYES! I have noticed that my daughters are slowly picking up the same nasty habit."
180454,Golfisher,2008-04-02 17:24:00,586,Better to have her grab you by the eyes than the balls.  We all know that it's the balls that matter the most.   LOL
180473,highdrifter,2008-04-02 18:04:00,2534, That's awesome Clive!  Pike sure have quite the range... how many continents is it?  check out those yaouge taimen they're holding up...  bizzaro!  cheers HD
180487,Hookset,2008-04-02 18:23:00,367,"  Crying??? C'mon Roy, that was a well founded discussion as to whether or not motors being built in China would influence whether or not you purchased one. I thought it was a good topic, no rants, and maturely discussed. Pretty sure any comments that may have offended were simply meant in jest or an attempt at humor. And yes, I read them all again.  Go Fishing already, Some of us never stopped.   Hookset."
180503,nancur373,2008-04-02 18:50:00,1211,It's the same way we held cod fish back home in Newfoundland
180644,Rich,2008-04-02 22:29:00,3927,Glad I didn't post my vertical hold 20lber from when I was 10
180133,mikeymikey,2008-04-01 23:31:00,376,Hello.  I was just browsing through Flickr site and ran in to this photo of a little boy?girl? holding a pike.  Observe.  
180142,Gerritt,2008-04-01 23:40:00,6129,I used to hear stories of Pike being handled by the eyes... Mainly from old timers...   G
180147,Lungelarry,2008-04-01 23:56:00,294,When their dead it doesn't matter how you hold them. I hope her and her family enjoyed a great pike meal.
180148,silveradosheriff,2008-04-01 23:57:00,1025,At least it's not a vertical hold.....
180150,Roy,2008-04-01 23:59:00,13728,"Yeah, I'm with Larry on this one. It's just a great picture of a cute child with what might be the best meal their family has in any given month."
180158,solopaddler,2008-04-02 00:05:00,8605,"Cool picture, looks like Mongolia."
180159,douG,2008-04-02 00:05:00,2693,Flickr has some great pictures.  Thanks for posting that one.  Sometimes I look like that when I am fishing too.
180160,ccmtcanada,2008-04-02 00:06:00,7971, Me too...especially in my younger days....
180161,FishFinder,2008-04-02 00:08:00,481,I think he was doing it a favour  Doesent look like he quite had the time to finish up.
180162,douG,2008-04-02 00:08:00,2693,"I've never been to Mongolia, but I always liked the music."
180165,danc,2008-04-02 00:10:00,4677,Poor guy. He probably smelled like Pike for a week after that. I wouldn't wish that on anyone.
180167,mepps,2008-04-02 00:18:00,1301,"Id' be inclined to think they were keeping all the fish they caught, but its not a recommended hold for C&R!  That guy actually has a bunch of great fishing photos from Mongolia - check it out Fishing in Mongolia"
180176,bassmaster4,2008-04-02 00:40:00,801,his fly is undone lol
180181,Maverick,2008-04-02 00:48:00,371,"It's probable somewhere up in the NWT or nunavut. Looks like an inuit child. I've spend many summers up there, biggest pike i got was 33lbs. Best pike fishing in the world up there as far as im concerned. Spent an afternoon fishing them with big 5"" spoons. Caught them every second cast and the smallest all afternoon was 13lbs. And Roy, I wouldnt worry about them starving up there or that being the best meal in months. They go out and shoot 100 caribou in an afternoon like it's nothing. But pretty nice people up there, except the guy who got his arse kicked by his wife haha, shoulda seen that guy...wow"
180190,Terry,2008-04-02 01:00:00,14456,of course his fly is down  he was fly fishing
180198,forrest,2008-04-02 01:16:00,1032,"Great pic.....its really weird!   Yep, thats how people used to hold them.  My 30 year old (as lost)  fishing book says that holding the pike by the eyes is the correct way to handle them.  However, recent wisdom says that that is the wrong way to go about it. http://www.northernpikefishing.ca/pike-tips.htm   forrest"
180204,lookinforwalleye,2008-04-02 01:31:00,4399,Thank the baby Jesus that the young lad was not holding a Musky like that or he`d be in trouble! LOL
180209,Roy,2008-04-02 01:36:00,13728,"Lighten up folks. This is a picture of a child holding a dead fish. I have some dead fish in my freezer. If it'll make you feel any better, I can promise you that they are packaged and frozen HORIZONTALLY. I was also very careful not to to touch their eyes as I cleaned them not to damage their optic nerves.  We have another dude on another post crying because Mercury marine is building some of its motors in China. Don't blame the Chinese, don't blame Mercury..blame yourselves. If you are not self sufficient and your children are not self sufficient, you will lose. You can't expect the company that you work for or the union who taxes you for protection to protect you against living beyond your means.  Where are we going with all of this? Can we just fish now?"
180213,FishFinder,2008-04-02 01:40:00,481,
180221,Gerritt,2008-04-02 01:45:00,6129,I hardly think there was any crying Roy.  G
180225,irishfield,2008-04-02 01:48:00,26272,See what happens when the steelers preach no nets.. no nets...
180226,Greencoachdog,2008-04-02 01:48:00,8163,  Yer killin' me Cliff!!!
180230,FishFinder,2008-04-02 01:50:00,481,"Roy, We all know Gerrit likes to complain (rant) even when their not his own compaints.  Most of us have learned to deal with it  Maybe its time for another hug the mod day?"
180234,danc,2008-04-02 01:53:00,4677,  Well I still think that the kid would reek for a week or so.  And I'd still rather not catch a Pike than catch one. Despite the fact that I belong to a union.
180235,Gerritt,2008-04-02 01:53:00,6129,care to elaborate further? please I am looking forward to it..  G
