181225,jdmls,2008-04-04 00:58:00,575,"still managed ay.....you never cease to amaze me  NICE FISH.....and the dirt cat, LOL you broke the ice for 2008 !!"
181276,ccmtcanada,2008-04-04 01:54:00,7971," Yeah, like we believe you now Scott....LOL.  Great job out there...as usual  Nice fish....as usual  It's great to see your reports again....board hasn't quite been the same without them!!"
181286,danc,2008-04-04 02:05:00,4677,Oh my. Certainly those fish have seen better days. I'm with Gerriit on this one.
181310,Pinch,2008-04-04 02:27:00,231,"Holy cr@p, I bet you'd catch a fish drifting in a hot tub wouldn't you!!! lol"
181336,Guest Floatfisher,2008-04-04 03:01:00,0,"Why would you even post pictures like that? Steelies rolled in mud, muddy gills, protective slime removed, bleeding? I agree with Dan, those fish have seen better days. Not a way to promote catch and release for sure. You guys dont have to take a pic of EVERY steelhead you catch"
181341,Sebastian,2008-04-04 03:07:00,208,They invented these things called tripods. They sell for about $30. $30 sounds fair instead of killing a bunch of bows for some bad pics. Just a thought.
181344,Pinch,2008-04-04 03:13:00,231," hmm one pic of a fish on the ground, another of a dead fish on the ground, wow thats terrible!!!  oh the humanity!!"
181350,FishFinder,2008-04-04 03:22:00,481,those are among the worst steelhead pictures i've ever seen
181399,chickenhawk,2008-04-04 06:50:00,612,"You see its guys like FloatFisher who sign up to the site a day ago and think they know it all about river fishing, and come on here and make comments such as the one made in this thread, that take the fun out of it....look at the real steelheaders on this site like Solopaddler, Chrome Catcher and Canadian Copper....they go out and catch fish pretty much every time they go out and provide us with some fantastic photos.....just because the fish is dirty does not mean it is dead.....GREAT JOB CC!!!! I understand that you were by yourself and had no one to take a picture of you holding the fish so the fish had to sit on the ground and did not want to cooperate.....a little mud is not going to hurt the fish and I am sure that it swam away just fine and he explained that the hook was deep inside the other fish so he had to keep it....cmon guys show some respect and appreciate the fact that these guys take these pictures to show us on here....once again EXCELLENT JOB CC!!!! I hope to see you on the river someday and maybe I will learn a thing or two.....  till then,  Hawk"
181400,jonnybass,2008-04-04 06:59:00,346,I agree with Chickenhawk on that.
181403,Tarzan's Jane,2008-04-04 07:36:00,1183,"Nice fish.  Creative with the pics too.  I think shorefisherman should bring a nice soft towel to lay the fish on and take the pic... it will serve two purposes...can also be used as a ""crying towel""."
181427,brickNblock,2008-04-04 11:33:00,598,Sebastian.....Floatfisher................Steelheader   None of you must be steelhead fishermen.. If you were you'd know full well that bringing chrome out of the water to the river bank in the early spring will muddy the fish.  Any of you try to bring in a nice chrome after a rainy day either...same freaking thing.. 's Oh...excuse me... You most likely wipe down the fish and then prepare it for its photo session...... Ive enjoyed many years of Scotts reports as others have and also fished along side of him and he is the ultimate river pro.....BAR NONE! bNb
181436,Gerritt,2008-04-04 11:47:00,6129,Looks as though the crap-disturbers have ruined yet another great thread... good job guys congrats.  G
