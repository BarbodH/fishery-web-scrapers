180874,bucktail,2008-04-03 13:02:00,1857,"I havnt gone home for openor in about 10 years. Probably wait till the lilacs come out, usually gets going then very good, 3rd week till 4th week. Going to be a late spawn so stick close to the rivermouths and pick off the abundant males that should be still in the area."
180876,lew,2008-04-03 13:06:00,12767,"Leave a few for me boyz, I'll be heading down on the 16th for our annual 4 day trip.  We camp at Bass Cove park down by Adolphustown."

I think this will be my 7th or 8th year staying there...great place, great people.  With the late spawn, I'm thinking (hoping) a lot of fish will still be in the flats and Hay Bay area.  Good luck everyone.  Cheers"
