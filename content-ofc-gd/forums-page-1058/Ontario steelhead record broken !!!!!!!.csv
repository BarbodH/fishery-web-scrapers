179954,steverowbotham,2008-04-01 17:24:00,1800,"According to the Globe and Mail, Hector Martinez, a 12 year old boy from Scarborough was fishing with his dad and uncle in Duffin's Creek yesterday afternoon with night crawlers and a float.  Just 10 minutes into fishing, little Hector felt a big tug on his little Ugly Stik rod and immediately called his dad and uncle for assistance.  ""His pole was bent so far over,"" his uncle said, ""that I knew it had to be a huge fish.  Hector's dad eventually netted the fish and to their astonishment, they couldn't believe the size of the steelhead.  When they weighed the steelhead on a Rapala scale, it read...  Ha!!! April Fools!  Be safe on the rivers with this rain guys"

180701,Greencoachdog,2008-04-03 00:53:00,8163,I caught a fish so big one time that a snapshot of it weighed 7 lbs.
180724,Rich,2008-04-03 01:40:00,3927,"Haha, not so far fetched though. Nautifish loves to tell the story of her fishing at a local dam when a girl came out, her first time fishing, casted out a worm and bobber and hooked into a whopper steelhead. Beginner's luck to the max!"
