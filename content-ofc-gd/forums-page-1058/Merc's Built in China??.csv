Basic rule, you spend more than you take in, your in debt, if people can`t afford to buy your products because they don`t have jobs? Your gone? Do I keep a roof over my head or buy your outboard?  A lot of manufactures have priced themselves out of business expecting double digit growth and profit rates, for them and their 7 and 8 digit executives."
180824,Greencoachdog,2008-04-03 10:36:00,8163,"  It also is for the consumer too! We squawk about the outrageous prices today, and the unions want more money for less work which drives the prices even higher... which makes the unions want more money for less work which drives the prices higher... Which makes China the worlds machine shop.  We only have our selves to blame for this, take a look around your house and see how many things come from other countries. If we wouldn't buy foriegn products there wouldn't be a market for them... but you look at your wallet when you need something and then compare prices and our dollars buy more for less overseas."

Gerritt if you, Spiel and myself get out fishing in the same boat, that should give us enough hot air to troll."
180951,OhioFisherman,2008-04-03 16:19:00,6623,"LOL Fish, 35 hp merc and it was rare for me to use a 6 gallon tank of fuel in a day, had the foot on the electric most of the time. One benefit of having smaller bodies of water to fish, 3000 acre inland lake here is pretty big.  Glen, for the most part unions try to maintain the standard of living for their members, not unreasonable to expect slow steady improvement in wages and working conditions. Yes some abuses and heavily publicized in the past, abuses by executives just recently started getting equal time.  Corporate pay goes up to 300 times their pay of 30 years ago and they complain when the worker asks for more? and wages aren`t up 4 times of 30 years ago? No increase in the minimum wage for like 10 years, but congress increases it`s pay 10 or 20 times, and wonders why the country is in trouble? LOL and still spends money like a sailor on a night out?  Bear Stearns? typical, millions pad to executives that broke the bank? By the taxpayer? The smartest minds in the country know how to abuse or spin it to the rest."

180662,Canuck2fan,2008-04-02 23:07:00,1444,"Lot of good points here, but the fact is eventually if you want a product you will not be able to do anything but buy it from overseas....  A lot of people blame unions, corporations and governments for the damage of globalization when the fact is the consumers, shareholders and the electorate are the only ones to blame. In other words all of us. Simple supply and demand would stop all of this erosion of the middle class.  Consumers are to blame because if we didn't buy it they wouldn't keep making it overseas and taking our jobs.  If you own or your pension plan owns shares in a company that takes jobs offshore and you all sold the shares and nobody bought them the company would cease to exist and stop outsourcing jobs basically overnight.  As for governments if we stopped electing losers who allow free trade but ignore the peril of not INSISTING on free trade we could turn things around if we don't to this we deserve what happens to us.  As for blaming the unions, yes they have their faults but no union EVER took one job offshore willingly. No union ever put into effect a contract that wasn't signed by the company who thought they could honour it. No union ever designed and then allowed the bean counters to butcher a product so that it was complete garbage that nobody wanted all by themselves either...."
180030,Blue_Axela,2008-04-01 18:53:00,88,I'm Chinese...and to be honest I stay away from Made In China goods as well.  Not for all the political reasons they many of you have brought up. My main concern is quality and to be honest Made In China = crap quailty.  $4000 car?  I would never risk my life and buy a Made in China car.
180033,Hookset,2008-04-01 18:56:00,367," Exactly...bang on. Produce all the cheap goods you want, but when there are no buyers left...what's it worth ?   Hookset."
180035,OhioFisherman,2008-04-01 19:03:00,6623,"China doesn`t give their people much voice  on things, news reports here the average Chinese worker makes 4 bucks a day, I do wonder how the people would feel if they knew and or could speak out about it with out repercussions? Tibet`s voice is being heard, at a price.  American car companies created their own problems, a faulty product, poor design at times, not responsive to the public, so they looked at options, the companies seemed to blame labor costs, except for the corporate decision makers that made the problems.  Divide and conquer, most Americans can`t understand they have been beaten down and more is coming, flood the labor force with cheaper immigrant labor to hold down costs and raise executives pay, if that`s not enough move the work to a cheap labor country with out a voice for the people.  Just my opinion though, American wages have been stagnant or falling corporate pay has risen to 300 times the difference of the 50`s and 60`s. The voice that screams we are worth it the loudest?  You do have to wonder if the benevolent rulers in China have billions stashed away in their homes and other places like Saddam Hussian did? Maybe their newspapers will check?  I step down from the soap box, gotta buy chinese! my pension fund is probably deeply in debt to them."
180045,doubleheader,2008-04-01 19:16:00,497,"Again, not argueing free trade is a bad thing, but like anything else the devil is in the details and our politicians (both parties I might add) led us down the primrose path with the guidance of special interest groups without a complete understanding as to the revolutionary impact this would have on the average wage earner nor a plan as to how to migrate into a global economy. That's my beef, it was like ""Here's a switch let's flip it and see what happens""  Bottom line the standard of living in the US is plummeting. Certain industries are disappearing altogether, and other are bankrupt and don't even know it yet. Like Ford for instance. We could have done things differently. We could have provided tax credits for industries to invest in their North American plants instead of loopholes to send their jobs overseas."
