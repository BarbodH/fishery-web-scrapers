I had posted a couple of reports on the old forum, but I was too busy with work last year to post any.  I am on team 8 for the tourney this year so I figured I would post some of my pics from last year as a sort of introduction.  I am looking forward to soft water and I will try and post weekly reports this summer.  Most of the these fish were caught in buckhorn/pigeon/chemong.  The Cod was caught in PEI and the Kingfish and Jack Cravalle were caught in Panama.  I have about 150 more pics from last season so if I have time I will post some more.             "

181508,Whitemikeca,2008-04-04 13:57:00,138,"Thanks guys.  I wasn't able to get out as much as I wanted to last season because I was busy with work, but I did manage to a catch a few good ones when I did get on the water.  I should have much more free time this summer so I am hoping to get out at least once per week."
