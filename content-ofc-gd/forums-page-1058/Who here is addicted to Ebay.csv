181300,oxcowboy,2008-04-04 02:14:00,544,WOOHOOO!!!!!!!          just won my new baitcaster at less than half the price of bass pro.   jason
181422,Marko,2008-04-04 11:15:00,854,"There are some unbelivable deals there! Yesterday i phoned canadian tire and asked for a quote for drill/slot rotors for an impala and the price i got was 105 $ a piece for front tires and 65 $ a piece for the rear ones.  Went on ebay, found 4 of the same rotors with high performace brake pads for 160$ plus 66$ for shipping.  You can also get 70 spoons and crank baits, random sizes for 69 dollars i think. 250 flies for about 40 dollars, just crazy stuff.  I think if you go through pay pal your credit card number is secure and insured by pay pal. For those who dont have a credit card, cant you just send them a pre paid check or money orders or some other type of payments?"
180843,Marko,2008-04-03 11:54:00,854,"I signed up for ebay account 3 days ago and i already have bought an 8mp polaroid camera, i bought a motherboard with a dual core intel processor i bid on 30 carp flies plus i bought a 4GB memory card for the camera!  I think i might have a problem lol"
180862,ccmtcanada,2008-04-03 12:52:00,7971,Cant talk right now....bidding ends in 1 minute.......

180887,Maverick,2008-04-03 13:40:00,371,"I wouldn't say I am addicted. Being addicted means you think you have a problem. I live in Ontario and last summer worked up in the arctic in Nunavut. The first day we got internet in our camp I bought a skidoo on ebay. Over the last few years I have bought 15 fishing reels, tons of tackle, jig molds, lead, hooks, paintball guns, camera, MP3 players, computer gear, fta boxes, banjo, yes a banjo, fish tank gear, clothes, shoes, 5 pairs of rayban sunglasses, speakers, the list goes on. Wow, everywhere I look I see something I bought on ebay. I am typing on the keyboard I bought on ebay, using the computer of which half of the components were purchased on ebay. Maybe I do have a problem. Probably....not. Presently in search of an electric bow mount trolling motor, butt seats and pedestals. Good luck, happy bidding."
180891,kickingfrog,2008-04-03 13:50:00,8333,  That was going to be my line.  I wonder how much we've outbid each other on items???
180899,Joey,2008-04-03 14:15:00,9122,"I wouldn't say I'm addicted, but I do buy alot.  But I also sell so I make the money back (that's what I tell Paul anyhow   )  Joey"
180900,fishing n autograph,2008-04-03 14:17:00,2540,i was addicted...first time I got on it I dropped $800 on autographs
180911,Marko,2008-04-03 14:41:00,854,Reading some of these comments made me feel better about myself haha As i am typing this just bought some red and green floats for steelheading and some hooks.  now i gotta start selling stuff lol
180919,JohnAB,2008-04-03 14:57:00,178,I have bought a fair bit on Ebay from vehicles to fishing tackle. If one searches there are deals to be had as long as S+H is not ridiculous. Have only had one problem ever and that was with a seller who acknowledged he received my payment but I never received the goods. At his doing we went thru the EBAY appeal process but as soon as I had him dead in the water he quit the appeal process and EBAY could have cared a less and let it go. Thank goodness it was only $20.
180932,KyleM,2008-04-03 15:26:00,218,I wish I knew how to work the damned thing. The last credit card I tried using wouldnt allow me to do stuff online.  Theres a lot of 130 packs of 3x strike king soft plastics that I would really like to have!

181142,irishfield,2008-04-03 23:40:00,26272,There's no need to give your credit card to buy... if you don't want to.
181154,Gerritt,2008-04-03 23:46:00,6129,"Twilight, I will give you my phone number... you can just give it to me over the phone..  PS.. I charge 3% extra for Amex.  G"

181248,mepps,2008-04-04 01:26:00,1301,"I wouldnt say I'm addicted, btu I just won 5 new pais of sunglasses."
181262,oxcowboy,2008-04-04 01:37:00,544,"ive bought everything from fishing tackle and hunting gear to nascar tickets, ive been looking at atvs lately and trying to buy a baitcaster right now.  i love it.  i have only been burned once, and thats because it was to good to be true on a pair of binocs,  they came, but just real cheap made.  i guess you get what ya pay for sometimes, but still alot of good deals to be had.  jason"
181273,danc,2008-04-04 01:51:00,4677,"  I must ask why you'd need 5 pairs? I assume ""pais"" means pairs."
181291,mikethespike,2008-04-04 02:08:00,51,"not addicted either,  i just buy what i need ( i swear).  kidding aside,  if the stuff i buy off @ ebay are available locally i'll gladly purchase everything from here.   so yeah have purchased watches, computer stuff, pda/cellphone accesories, fishing tackle, reels, rods, lures & baits from asia to europe.  just got my 7ft. fladen celtic sea rod and am dying to try it out @ the harbourfront"
181297,danbouck,2008-04-04 02:12:00,4380,"I'm not addicted. I've only bought a motorcycle, car, tons of fishing gear, many many guitars, electronics and a boat! Sadly i've been cut off but i can't figure out why"
