180818,lew,2008-04-03 09:03:00,12767,"Hey Pete, once you decide which unit your gonna buy, have a look at Radioworld @ hwy 400 & Steeles as they have some excellent prices when compared to other marine electronics shops around here.  For my X510c they were roughly $80 cheaper than BPS or LeBarons and are usually about the same as Cabellas for many units.  Just a thought for you.  http://radioworld.ca/index.php?cPath=3"
180838,AzuluSpookd,2008-04-03 11:31:00,348,  Oh crap....I'm gonna have to reflect and see where my priorities lie....I've got a Humminbird AND a Motorguide   I've still got my handheld Lowrance though..
180846,BITEME,2008-04-03 12:11:00,1969,Humminbird 787c2i sonar/GPS+WAAS/Chartplotter combo  bought this one and it is awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!
180895,irishfield,2008-04-03 14:07:00,26272, Well Azulu... I've got a Lowrance and a motorguide... so I'm only have a red neck. Must be something about where you live!
180906,brickNblock,2008-04-03 14:27:00,598,Thank y'all for some very exellent info. Art....I'll deff. be going dual cone coverage T-Y much... Going to try and maintain as high a wattage as possible. Have been pricing units just about everywhere and came up with fairly decent deals on diff units at diff locations. I hadnt even thought of RadioWorld...Lew....I checked their website and most prices Ive been given were better there...T-Y I ndo have another thought with no answer for.... Internal...Builtin....External Antennas..? Is there one better then another..or just diff. scenario of use. Thanks again all.. bNb
180965,AzuluSpookd,2008-04-03 17:12:00,348,"I have the external for my Humminbird.....when I was trying to pick which one to buy....the lowrance model that I was looking at (can't remember which one now), you needed a seperate power source.  I checked the reviews on cabela's for some of the internal and there were alot of complaints about losing their signals, so that is why I opted for an external."
181098,aplumma,2008-04-03 22:10:00,6896,"The lowrance extra power source is for the network the antenna hooks to not the antenna. It powers the net2000 that you can expand to include engine monitoring and fuel. This is not an issue and is simple to wire in so don't be scared of it. The external antenna is a small puck that needs a flat place  that does not have any structure above it. (canvas is fine) I have mounted the puck on top of an aluminum hard top, front deck,back rail and next to the motor with no problems. If you have the ability to chase the wires to any of these locations then you will be fine with an external. I however havent had any issues with an internal antenna when used thru a canvas top held with an aluminum frame rods. Will you be leaving the unit hooked up all of the time or removing it evertime you put the boat away? Its not a big deal just 1 more wire to hook/unhook. If you bring your boat up to Lak Air this year I will give you a lesson on what info it can give you....you just wont believe what it can do and how much info you are missing.  Art"
181218,brickNblock,2008-04-04 00:51:00,598,Art.... Hey bud! I/We'll not be making lakair this year i dont think man. Besides checking out all the bellsNwhistles and the new boat in general.... Ive got to complete the roof on my workshopNoffice............ put a subfloor in the office and full electric..then drywall/tape/mud/paint/carpet etc......... After that Im putting on an addition to the new house...aprox 900sq/ft. It involves ripping into the exististing roof..... it'll be a busy year to say the least......... Today i booked a slip at BayMarine in bellville on the BayOQuinte..... Hydro/FillingStationNwashdown ..for the season This way when Im ready and have the time we'll just skip down there ...hop in the boat and off we go. The slip is right on the Bay. Next year we'll be ready for Lakair. I read with dillegence all youve sent and it s great. The antenna thing puzzeled me a little. A member here also sent me a website that shows exactly what you said......... basically.....most use only 1/10 of their possibilities..... I'll spend the money for wht I want..but I want to use all of it Art.....It'll wait to lakair '09 for your private tutoring... but in the mean time Ill learn as much as I can. ThankYou my friend. All else who have replied I have equally taken in all of them and got to tell ya's the info is invaluable. I hope someone else is reading these posts and might be gaining some knowledge with all this as it's exactly how i learned. Someones elses posting can be the ticket to your own questions... This is part of this board and what makes it a little better then anywhere else. Thanks for your patience folks. bNb
181223,Whopper,2008-04-04 00:55:00,2174,So Peter I have only one question  Where is the pic of your new ride?
