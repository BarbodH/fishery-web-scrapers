180795,danc,2008-04-03 03:14:00,4677,  Lucky me then. I guess.
180803,JerseyDog,2008-04-03 03:27:00,190,"OK - maybe $375 is a little low for $150k in mortgage but the math still fundamentally works and honestly, running two cars 3-4k per month is definately gonna run you more than $375 anyway.  At the same time, for Holdfast, Ithe commute is probably not so bad. I imagine its probably 30-45 minutes everyday and I assume at a nice cruise and no 15 lane 401 style traffic jams to slow one down.  Also, if Holdfast can get out of his house in a red hot market and buy into something a little less hot, now is probably the time for that as well. The bubble afterall has already burst in the US and its on its way here."
180875,Dano,2008-04-03 13:03:00,719," Why guess, not sweet enough?"
180881,fishinggeek,2008-04-03 13:20:00,325," Thanks for such a great example.  You have bolstered my belief about never commuting.  I pay much more in terms of housing prices, property taxes, and so forth but I also enjoy above-average salaries living in Toronto.  Balancing work-life (not to mention the costs of fuel and fender benders) is a huge factor in making these decisions.  Sometimes I hear about house prices outside of Toronto, and they do sound like a bargain.  I'll re-read your post everytime I feel a bit jealous of commuters."
180917,JohnAB,2008-04-03 14:50:00,178,"Being very familiar with North Battleford and surrounding area I would say go for it. Driving highway 4 for that distance would be nothing in the winter as traffic would be light. In the summer, with the holiday crowd, it can get a bit busy but nothing compared to those doing a big city commute. The area you are moving too has awesome whitetail deer hunting if you are into that (have hunted there lots) and has an abundance of lakes to choose from to fish after work as you are aware. On the real estate side in NB, I think the market there will get even better in the next few years as they are now flying workers out of the airport there to Fort McMurray. Also, there is a lot of oil in Saskatchewan. Ask those in the know and they will tell you that the heavy oil deposits in Saskatchewan rival or exceed those found in Alberta just that it is more expensive to get it out of the ground due to the shield and rock. You would probably know more than this than I, but rumours floating around last year there stated that Syncrude or Suncor was buying up a lot of property north of NB around Meota, Edam etc. I know the value of our cabin on Murray Lake north of NB sure has gone up in the past few years. My dad bought our lot with small cabin on it for $500 back in 1952. Over the years he probably put $30000 into the cabin, new garage, boathouse/bunkhouse etc and now if we were to sell it, we would easily get $450000 for it as we have a double lot in a prime location right on the water."
180378,JerseyDog,2008-04-02 13:55:00,190,"The below is my general analysis of commuting (albeit from a Toronto perspective) which may be helpful...  Commute from Newmarket to Toronto - 60km each way - 120km per day x 5 days/week x 50 weeks/year = 30,000km / Average Car - 10l/100km = 3,000 l of fuel per year x $1 litre avg. fuel price = $3,000  Commute Toronto to Toronto - 15km each way - 30km per day x 5 days/week x 50 weeks/year = 7,500km / Average Car - 10l/100km = 750 l of fuel per year x $1 litre avg. fuel price = $750  NET FUEL SAVINGS: $2,250 per year or $187.50 per month  Add a dual income/commuting family and now your savings for living within 15km of work is now $375 per month.  This is fuel alone. Don't forget tires / 407 charges / oil changes / etc. and if you commute, you need to replace your cars more often, with newer more reliable cars.  $375 per month will make the payment on about $150k in mortgage. So instead of paying $350k to live in Newmarket you can now afford $500k to live in Toronto (or more specifically closer to work). Add up the other expenses, and you can buy an even more expensive house. Move down to a one car family, and now you really have a lotta of extra dough around.  Now about the Time: Newmarket to Toronto - 1 hour commute x 2 per day x 5 days/week x 50 weeks in a year = 500 hours Intown Commute - 20 min commute x 2 per day x 5 days/week x 50 weeks in a year = 167 hours  NET TIME SAVINGS: 333 hours / Avg. Work Week 37.5 hours = 9 ""work weeks"" per year commuting.  Now imagine you spent those extra NINE weeks working on a side business, putting more hours on the job, studying something or spending time with family. From a simple financial perspective, imagine how much income you could generate with all that extra time. Its NINE WEEKS of extra earning potential EVERY YEAR.  If you do the math, the suburbs and outlying towns only make sense from a financial perspective if you do not commute. Once you start getting into one hour plus daily commutes, as far as I can tell it costs the average person MORE money not less, even with TO real estate prices factored in.  Obviously there are a zillion factors to consider and everyone has different needs, I am simply pointing out that the financial benefits of suburban living and long commutes may not be as positive as they appear on the surface, in fact a lot of the times, its quite the opposite."
180436,charlied,2008-04-02 16:50:00,584,the thing you mentioned about Mortgage free and closer to your cottage would make me jump all over that.   After a week you wouldn't notice the travel.  You will save huge money just having no Mortgage. plus you will be able to hit the cottage more often.
180443,bbog,2008-04-02 17:13:00,665,JerseyDog has done a great financial analysis but for me it really breaks down to this.  5 days of extra commuting time to save on one weekend trip = not worth it.  Just my opinion and coming from someone who has seen his daily commute go from 35 minutes to over 1 hour during the last 10 years - with NO CHANGE in commuting distance or location.  You grow to HATE traffic and driving.
180633,Victor,2008-04-02 22:11:00,1609,a lot of people travel greater distance one way to get to work ... i worked at the airport during one of my co-op terms and i know someone who came from the port hope area ... that's 2 hours one way and going through the crazy 401 during rush hour as well.  IMO having to go through all the traffic jams is the worst ...
180655,holdfast,2008-04-02 22:47:00,1813,"Jersey Dog you make an excellent case with your figures.  In my case gas would be higher.  118 now and threatening to go higher.  I truly don't mind the trip as my job is an 8 hour job and for 3 years I traveled 25 minutes to Wainwright and I think it was about the same from Wasaga to Borden.  My only Road Rage was in the summer entering Wasaga with all the out of town Idiots acting like they own the place.  But for 40 minute drive to the oil patch I HATED IT.  Mostly because it seemed I left in the Dark and came home in the Dark.  My big reason for possibly the move is, I'm so close to fishing, I may get a better house for cheaper which could possibly put me mortgage free.  I'm 49, so I still have to work, but all I need is a job that is just above minimum to put me in the same lifestyle as I previously had when I was in the Military thanks to my non Indexed pension.  So I'm not really stuck for a high paying job.  Kids are just about grown up, so they're not an issue and no doubt they will be all over the place as I have one in Calgary.  But I really appreciate listening to both sides of the story.  One last note, I would be taking advantage of the value of my house as it doubled in two years, but there is absolutely no advantage to moving within the city as everything has gone up (ITS an Alberta Type Boom) but there may be a small advantage to moving outside and unfortunately, the best is 67 kms as everywhere else, its close to an oil patch.  This town Borders the Boreal forest so south is prairie, and North is forest."
180670,Canuck2fan,2008-04-02 23:28:00,1444,"You have to do what you feel is best.... Two years isn't that long though as it will probably take you 2 to 3 months to sell, buy and move. What I would really think about is if your house has already doubled in value in a couple years how much will it be worth in another two years? What will the value of the other house do in the same time. Saving even two grand a month with no mortgage for two years will seem like a very poor bargain if the house you are in doubles again in the next two years and the other one stays at the same value?  Seem like you have a very good if complex situation though, escalating house values while most of the continent is seeing house values drop or stay stagnant."
180686,charlied,2008-04-03 00:02:00,584,I would like to know where your getting a mortgage of $150K  for $375 per month.....might need to change to that company...LOL.  Cause my mortgage is less than that and almost double monthly.....LOL
180713,danbouck,2008-04-03 01:21:00,4380, Was thinking the same thing!
180752,bucktail,2008-04-03 02:15:00,1857,If i got my dream job of Playboy photographer I would!
180758,crappieperchhunter,2008-04-03 02:18:00,2582,Did a 150KM round trip commute from Oshawa to West end of Toronto for over 2 years. Actually enjoyed the 45-60 minute run each way. Gave me time to think/plan/relax. Basically it comes down to who you are. You  either have a commuter's mindset or you don't. It's not about money it's about what works best for you. Good luck making a decision.
180764,douG,2008-04-03 02:29:00,2693,"I've done a one hour commute before, and it was not so good, there was no upper limit to how long the trip might take.  Currently, I do 23 kms to work in 18 minutes, give or take 3 minutes, most of the time. I much prefer the 18 minute deal.  As well, I can still be at Massey Hall in 20 minutes, I like that."
180208,holdfast,2008-04-02 01:35:00,1813,"I am thinking of selling my house and moving out of The North Battleford City to a small town 67 kms North.  The advantage would be that it would leave me Morgage free, small town cheaper on Taxes.  Another advantage is it would cut my weeknd trips to my fishing Trailer by 40 minutes to 1hr 45 mins.  The disadvantage is that my wife works in the City and I in a resort town on the way to the city.  In essance, it would take me 30 minutes to work, vice twenty and my wife 40 minutes vice 5 minutes, but we can car pool it.  Basically Im cutting out my morgage entirely instead of waiting two years.  We figure we could have a similar if not nicer house.  Just wondering if you guys would make the same decision, or some experiences.  Kids are not involved."
180210,ccmtcanada,2008-04-02 01:37:00,7971,"I travel 110kms per day in Toronto rush hour traffic and I dont even have a cottage that's any closer....LOL.  I live that far from work because I cant afford a house in the city....once you do it for a few weeks, you likely wont even notice the drive anymore."
180211,danbouck,2008-04-02 01:40:00,4380,I would do it for sure! A lot of people around Cambridge drive the hour to Toronto for work.
180212,Gerritt,2008-04-02 01:40:00,6129,I commute over 160kms per day... I actually find it relaxing I sip my coffee and cruise
180217,Guest lundboy,2008-04-02 01:42:00,0,"You can get some CDs and learn a new language.  I travel 67Km each way, I hate it but what can you do?  Might as well do something useful like learn a language. (or something educational)"
180219,Roy,2008-04-02 01:43:00,13728,But you were worried about the price of gas? No longer a problem?
180220,muskymike,2008-04-02 01:44:00,772,"I do about 124 Kms a day. But I bit the Bullet and take the 407 on the way in so that cuts the drive down in half. Just like Cliff said, do it a few times and you wont even notice the drive anymore"
180224,danc,2008-04-02 01:47:00,4677,"Personally I couldn't even imagine that. When I work that far away from home, they give me $95.00 per day and I get a room."
180228,Weeds,2008-04-02 01:49:00,782,"I was commuting Peterborough to Toronto, about 260 km round trip; for about a year.  When you were travelling when there was not alot of traffic on the road it was doable. About an hour and 20 minutes. Alot of people spend that amount of time just getting to work who live in the GTA. Throw in any kind of traffic and it gets awful. So basically it's not the distance that matters so much as the traffic (and the fuel efficiency of your ride). I'd say go for it."
180229,Gerritt,2008-04-02 01:50:00,6129,Mike I take the 407 daily... makes the commute a breeze...  G
180231,irishfield,2008-04-02 01:50:00,26272,The 18 foot walk does me in some mornings......
180244,muskymike,2008-04-02 02:04:00,772,"G, you probably pass me or I pass you every day. Look for a Gold/Goldish ahah Silverado with a broken Prop Hitch Cover. Honk as you are passin' haha"
180255,Burtess,2008-04-02 02:13:00,901,"30 to 40 minutes commute is still bearable.... if the increase fuel usage and wear and tear on the vehicle is OK with you then go for it.  I drive about ~250-300Km per day for work, not all in one shot but between customers.  If I didn't get paid mileage for it, I would go nuts...  Burt"
180259,Gerritt,2008-04-02 02:16:00,6129,"  Mike, I drive one of two vehicles a white F150 with an OFC sticker, NL sticker and Apple Stocker in the back window... or a black honda with a apple sticker in the rear window... I am usually on the Hwy around 6:30ish am  I work in Vaughan (the Jane St exit) where abouts are you?  G"
180260,Bernie,2008-04-02 02:17:00,3190,Somedays the drive to work is intolerable.....but only because I'm going to work. It's only a block away.
180262,holdfast,2008-04-02 02:21:00,1813,"Thanks guys, kind of helps.  Yea Roy, Now you Know why Im always concerned with Gas.  Like alot of members already mentioned, We Canadians have it different because we are so vast.  You should see SK.  If I move I will pass two towns in 67 kms.  The majority is Indian Reservations and farmland, mainly cattle.  Yes gas is a concern, but Ive kind of kept that as part of the equation.  Ill save $1400 a month by being morgage free.  Gas will take a chunk, especially the way its going.  So I bought a small car."
180264,muskymike,2008-04-02 02:26:00,772, I get off at the 403 split and head to Dundas from there. I am in Mississauga. I used #5 the whole until the 407 on the way home. The $150 a month is bad enough for 1 way a month. I will keep an eye out for ya for sure. I need to get me a OFC Sticker for the Truck and Boat.  I am not usually on the 407 till about 7 or 7:30 though. Yeah I am lazy but I play hockey in Oakville 2 nights a week so usually 4 out of 5 days i am not home until about 10 or 11.  The only other distinguishing mark on my truck is the Passenger side has Vent Visors and the Drivers Side doesnt. I had to rip them off haha.  I'll keep an eye out for the stickers.
180265,Gerritt,2008-04-02 02:28:00,6129,Good call on the small car! I drive the Honda mainly to and from work... I have a gas allowance from work... and I never exceed it in the car and I commute more then you will be... now with the truck I blow through the 500.00 in less then 2 weeks!   I would say you might have a decent pay off here... especially if your plan is to retire in the next few years..  Keep us updated as to your plans.  G
180266,Toronto_Angler,2008-04-02 02:29:00,698,I live in the city and it still takes me an hour to get to work
180271,bpsbassman,2008-04-02 02:48:00,941,"I drive 100 km each way to work at BPS on weekends, but that's another story!!!"
180275,bramptonjerry,2008-04-02 02:53:00,132,it's not worth it...it will drive you into the ground...too much time away from home
180293,Sinker,2008-04-02 04:22:00,8692," I have to agree.  Too much time on the road, makes an 8 hour day into a 12 hour day.......it sucks.  But if your into that kinda thing........  Sinker"
180300,solopaddler,2008-04-02 08:44:00,8605,"Hmm, if you're only 2 years away from being mortgage free right now, that's not a very long time. Personally I would never make any long term decision based on a short term inconvenience or problem. Another thing to consider, is the area you're considering buying in as good an investment? If North Battleford will gain you more equity I probably wouldn't make the move. Bottom line though, which ever option will improve your quality of life, that's the one I'd take."
180305,Dano,2008-04-02 09:57:00,719," Not all of us have the luxury of sweetass union contracts Dan.  Rob, it doesnt sound too bad. 40 min. one way isnt that big a deal, but yea, your fuel costs might be the clincher."
180308,pinerider,2008-04-02 10:07:00,8," What do you do now?  If you just come home from work and flop on the couch, the extra time spent commuting won't make any difference. If you really want to live in the town you're thinking of moving to, the commute should be no problem.  I've been commuting 47 km each way for the last 20 years, I've about had enough, but I can retire next year.  I took the job 20 years ago because I thought I would be moving somewhere else, but it didn't happen. I don't mind the drive most of the time, but I waste up to 2 hours a day getting to work and back. Make sure your wife really wants to do the commute too, I know couples who have done similar moves, the wives seem to think it's no problem at first,  but a year or 2 later are not very happy about it."
