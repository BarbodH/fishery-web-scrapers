179753,LundGuy,2008-04-01 03:08:00,169,"Anyone interested in renting a cottage on an island on Lake Temagami please let me know. My wife and I stayed here for the last couple of years and its just beautiful.We wont be able to go this year so I told the owner up there I would try and help him out. He is just getting his web site up and going, so it should be up soon. This place is fabulous, just built two years ago and is on an island with only two other cottages,the owners and one other rental. It has full facilities, screened deck, gazebo with hot tub.Large private dock.Lots of fish (bass, lake trout) and surrounding portage lakes with plenty of walleye.One of the nicest spots I have been to. So send me a message if you want any more info. He told me he had a few open spots to book. My two weeks were last week of August and first week of Sept., so these are open right now."

179944,Fang,2008-04-01 17:13:00,1330,Darn  Was hoping it was end of july so I would taken it. Oh well back to sleeping in the boathouse.  I think I might have some pictures but they would be of the build or at least when Rick fell off the roof  For anyone interested the cottage is ~ 5-10 minute boat ride from the Mine Rd landing. Located in the main hub area just at the entrance to Spawning Bay.
179971,irishfield,2008-04-01 17:44:00,26272,Nice quiet bay with minimal boat traffic. I think there's only a couple cottages up in Spawing bay and the odd troller going by. Nothing but forest both sides of Rick's island.  Fin of the fish is blocking the boat house..  
180097,moose,2008-04-01 22:05:00,266,ive alreday got the back boathouse for my self booked it already
180098,moose,2008-04-01 22:06:00,266,yes the cottages are seclude and quiet except for rick running around the island after having a bad shooter drink
180113,Rich Clemens,2008-04-01 22:49:00,3131,I keep hearin' that there ain't no fish in Tamagami
180201,irishfield,2008-04-02 01:28:00,26272,Behave Rich... we just tell everyone that so they stay away!
180202,LundGuy,2008-04-02 01:28:00,169,"  If we were to believe every time some one said there was no fish here or there, we would never go fishing anywhere. Temagami has tons and tons of bass and lake trout. Walleye are plenty, just finicky, like most places can be, but you can fish the back lakes and limit every time."
180628,moose,2008-04-02 22:04:00,266,you have two back lakes within a 5 minute boat ride from the cottages as well as two more about twenty minutes away with boats for rent from rick in them from specle trout to pike picerel and bass as well
