So if you are planning a trip to Halley's this summer....ASK FOR ME!!! haha at least introduce yourself anyways so that I can meet some of the great people here on OFC.

180660,HTHM,2008-04-02 23:05:00,4082,"Congrads, I hope it goes well for you!"
180694,trapshooter,2008-04-03 00:28:00,1234,"Oh yeah, forgot to add my best advice for any new guide.... spend the money on a Gor-Tex rain suit, it's the best investment you can make towards your new job.  You'll spend FULL DAYS in the rain and you'll be an unhappy guide if you are soaked to the bone.  My Bass Pro Shops 100MPH suit has served me well and is far dryer then my colleague's Cabela's Guide Wear suits, which all leak in the crotch area, esp. if you're sitting.  Good luck with your new job!"
180704,Daplumma,2008-04-03 00:58:00,1961,Best of luck bud.Take a page from JP(Dip Lip)book and take lots of picks and post reports.The customers will love you and you may get a gig writing for magazines.Some of the best reports here were from when he was guiding a couple of years ago.Best of luck. Joe
180799,bpsbassman,2008-04-03 03:21:00,941,Congratulations.  Glad to see you living your dream.  Enjoy the ride and send us reports.
