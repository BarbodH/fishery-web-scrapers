180842,Whopper,2008-04-03 11:48:00,2174,"Welcome aboard Mustfish! Life as you know it changed when you joined.  This place can be addicting.  Seems we are neighbors so to speak and sounds like we have fished some of the same waters, although most of my fishing time is spent on Lake Erie and I also try to make it to Canada at least a couple weeks a year. I've also done a few flyins and will be doing another May 16.  Pike lures... the large Johnson silver spoons (silver or gold), 5 of diamonds, daredevil spoons and you may want to go to Gander Mountain in Huber and pick up some Grim Reaper spinners bait they have in stock, I've always done well with them. Another thing you may want to try is some swim baits. Going to tell ya my biggest pike to date came on a jig/twister combo and I've caught of lot of pike on the same set up.  Any other help you might need please feel free to pm me.  Cheers"
180849,lunkerbasshunter,2008-04-03 12:18:00,2585,welcome aboard!  good to see more friends from south of the border signing up!  Good luck with the stripper fishing!  Cheers!
180856,Whopper,2008-04-03 12:38:00,2174, LOL lunker Now if we could just find away to move the Living Room to our favorite fishing spots  mustfish will understand this comment
180884,mustfish,2008-04-03 13:34:00,32,"  I know I mean I have heard of the ""room"" I have a tool shop on north webster.  You fish the Stillwater much?"
180888,Whopper,2008-04-03 13:44:00,2174,Yes I use to fish the Stillwater a lot and there is not to many places in this area that I haven't fished. Our best fishing is the local streams that for sure.  You have pm!
180969,mustfish,2008-04-03 17:21:00,32,  That is not far from my shop. It is now called Behr a German company purchased it but still does the same work. The Air Force Museum is sweet! The Canada trip is my favorite of the year followed by the salmon trip in that state up north.
181059,Whopper,2008-04-03 20:59:00,2174," LOL can't say the ""M"" word can ya.  A true buckeye!"
181109,Bernie,2008-04-03 22:31:00,3190,We have good friends who live in Fairborn. They live close by to Wright-Patterson and the aircraft museum. Last time we visited them we did the tour of the museum. Anyone who goes take time for at least a day to see it all. I want to go again. Incredible place.
181116,Whopper,2008-04-03 22:44:00,2174,"LOL Bernie, I don't live in Fairborn but live real close to the museum. I haven't been to it in a few years though, I invite one of the members here that does the flying thing to come for a visit, figure it would give me good reason to go."
180363,mustfish,2008-04-02 13:24:00,32,"Hello everybody! Looks like a good active board. I live in Dayton Ohio and love to fish for smallies in the local rivers and creeks, stripers down at Cumberland, steelhead and salmon up around St. Joes in that state up north, and take a 7 day trip up to Canada every year towards the end of May(almost here!!!!). This year we are going to a lake in west central Ontario called Populus Lake(fly in) it is north of Kenora. Just wondering if anyone has fished or heard of this lake? If anyone has any tips for nailing those larger pike in the spring that would also be appreciated. It is good to be on board!  Thank you in advance!!!! Mustfish!"
180364,Roy,2008-04-02 13:26:00,13728,"Welcome aboard, Mustfish. Looking forward to your input."
180367,muskymike,2008-04-02 13:30:00,772,"Welcome Mustfish. Try Spinner Baits and Buzz Baits, they do wonders for pike up there. But in remote waters it seems anything works."
180381,mustfish,2008-04-02 14:01:00,32," Love that top water bite!!!!!! I have caught a lot of pike on poppers but they are usually smaller ones, but still a ton of fun!!! Maybe I am not using big enough lures? I know bigger lures will catch bigger fish but will it be to early in the season for bigger baits? On a side note, I just started fishing for musky last year. In Ohio we have a couple musky lakes and Ceasers Creek is only about 40 minutes from my house so hopefully I can nail a few this year. Last year I had about a 40 inch musky follow my inline spinner to the boat and once thru the figure eight! That is amazing how they will come right to the boat and not get spooked. That was sweet to see that big fish right next to the boat, had to remind myself to breathe LOL!"
180384,Reef Runner,2008-04-02 14:07:00,981,"Welcome to the board and I look forward to your input.  My recommondation for those Northern toothy critters is a BIG spoon, like a daredevil in the five of diamonds pattern or a heavy Cyclops.  Top water can be fun, just be sure to have a strong leader.  reefrunner"

180455,Ramble,2008-04-02 17:26:00,713,"Welcome.  As far as spoons go, don't leave home without a big williams whitefish. I'd also take a few blue fox vibrex # 4's or #5's in Orange, Yellow and Silver. Switch the treble to a single and add a 4 inch orange twister tail.  Buzzbaits are great in most colours, BUT my favourites is Black/Black buzzbaits...Booyah! Makes a good buzzbait for the price, and it has a real loud clacker on it.  Next up is a big huskey jerk....again the black model...Take off the rear most treble if you can use trebles at the lake you are going too...it will your life easier.....if it's a single hook only lake...but the hook in the middle position.  Chatter baits are also an asset. If the big pike arn't biting cause of bad weather.  That's the basics i'd be taking with me.  -R-"

I used to do lots of service work in your area (Chrysler radiator plant). My fondest memories are of visiting the Air Force Museum near Wright Pat. Like dying and going to heaven for an airplane guy. Your right, these are a great bunch of guys who would give you the shirts of their backs. You know, if they were actually wearing a shirt."
