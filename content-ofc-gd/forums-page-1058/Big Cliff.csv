I picked it up from the shop last Friday, took it into Nissan on Monday morning and had them give it a good going over and they said everything was excellent, all new parts etc.. Then on Tuesday a State Farm rep called and asked if he could stop by as they do random audits on body shops. I couldn't believe how thorough he was, checked everything right down to door gaps and fits and even the undercoating.  I can honestly say that I wouldn't hesitate to recomend any of the people that I had to deal with through this whole thing. I am very satisfied and glad to have my X-Trail back."
