180081,sirfish,2008-04-01 20:58:00,175,"buggers...at the risk of sounding racist, one word RESERVATION  Local law enforcement have told me that 99% of them end up there along with all your new pickups.  Friend took a photo over the Brantford reserve last year and it was littered with trucks in various stages of disassembley. Sorry for the loss , hope you had insurance up to date"

179528,Rattletrap2,2008-03-31 21:22:00,1652,"Likewise Terry, I'll let the local Yamaha dealer in Shelburne know about the theft. If they plan to unload it, we can at least make things difficult for them!"
179531,danbo,2008-03-31 21:27:00,2646,"Son's o' bees ripped my friend off just the same, during the day when he was at work. Never recovered either. All I can hope is that their Karma returns tenfold!"

179559,Cookslav,2008-03-31 22:25:00,1457,"Good chance the Police will nab them...  Not a crime of opportunity, or random. They scoped it out, and planned their day... Its more then likely a local who frequents your area, and saw somthing he liked. He'll probobly not be selling it any time soon.... But if he does the chance of the Cops getting is even better! They will no doubt be all over the local classifieds, and I'd hope the dealers will not take it with out the paperwork. Not much different then taking a car....  They'll get whats comming to them. I just hope for your sake its sooner then later.  I'll keep my eyes on the classifieds for ya. I'm actually looking at ATV""S right now any way."
179571,ccmtcanada,2008-03-31 22:38:00,7971,Terry...what a bummer!  I drive from the Oshawa area to Toronto every weekday and I'll be sure to look for a trailer with an ATV....even have the camera phone ready to take a pic if it looks even close.
179574,Clampet,2008-03-31 22:45:00,1947,"That's a hell of a thing, ain't it.  Ya can't turn yer back fer a minute without some wrong wordloser lookin' to take yer stuff.  Well, that's the beauty of this here site, it might help nab the sonnabeatch."
179576,lunkerbasshunter,2008-03-31 22:47:00,2585,"that sure sucks!!! i will keep my eyes open for it as well.  just a heads up you may want to look at kijiji, there are a ton of hot items on that site from what i hear form a few cops in my area.  Cheers!"
179691,irishfield,2008-04-01 01:27:00,26272,Terry... did you evict anyone this month or last?
179695,Terry,2008-04-01 01:31:00,14456,no I can't think of anyone who would want to do this to me
179696,bassmaster4,2008-04-01 01:32:00,801,Damn some people can be so stupid. Sorry about your ATV being stolen hope you find it the way it was when it was taken and that they find the idiot who stole it.
179789,Shelley Cooper,2008-04-01 09:58:00,394,"I heard about this theft on Rock 95 yesterday, but had No idea it was you Terry... Really sorry to hear this.  Hopefully with the radio reports and the OFC community, it gets recovered..."

179800,SlowPoke,2008-04-01 11:48:00,2984,"Terry, sorry to hear bud. That's an awesome machine and will certainly catch my attention if it goes by. If karma has anything to do with this we'll read about this guy going out on Simcoe and getting stranded on an ice float. Good luck Terry! -Brian"
179873,muskymike,2008-04-01 15:28:00,772,"Hey Terry, sent an email to about 60 people today trying to cover as much area as possible for you. Went from Timmins to Ottawa, Niagara to Sarnia. Tried to cover as much of the Province as I could. Dont know anyone in Quebec right now so I cant help you there. I will forward to my guys in the states as well."
179965,Spiel,2008-04-01 17:37:00,9065,....Brutal!
179974,fishindevil,2008-04-01 17:46:00,6254,"DAM !!!!!...Terry i know what you are going through as i just had my car stolen 2 weeks ago.  ...i hope the cops can find it ,and you know we are all looking for it as well,i have a camera phone as well,they better not try and drive near me with an atv, around me,as i will cross traffic to take a look as well !!!! hope the S.O.B""s get what they deserve,they might try to sell it,so watch all the ads,and check with dealers.....man im ticked off,"

179424,Gerritt,2008-03-31 17:52:00,6129,If the person plans on keeping the trailer.... It should NOT be hard to miss.... do you have any more pictures of the trailer Terry?  G
179426,irishfield,2008-03-31 17:54:00,26272,Okay Terry.. printed 5 copies of picture and model/serial # and off to the local dealers/repair guys for their bulletin boards.  Doubtful it will be helpful... but better than another kick in the nuts for yah.
179428,icefisherman,2008-03-31 17:56:00,952,"Hmmmmmmm I hate to read this Terry. Sorry there such idiots out there. Will let you know if I see it, as I know your ATV well. Hope you recover it quickly.  Cheers, Ice Fisherman"
179430,LeXXington,2008-03-31 18:00:00,1928,"Some people!!!  Sorry for you luck Terry,  I will keep an eye open but bet its boxed and sold by now"

179442,Puckhead,2008-03-31 18:35:00,377,Sorry to hear that Terry....  That really sucks.  I'll keep my eyes open but it's doubtful I'll see anything around Oakville...  Hopefully you had some good insurance.
179444,Reef Runner,2008-03-31 18:38:00,981,"Sorry about the loss and hopefully it'll be recovered soon.  I remember seeing a spot on ""A"" Channel new not long ago about a theft ring that was stealing trailers, ATV, cars and the sorts and dumping off on an abandoned lot until they sold 'em out of Barrie.   If anyone is driving by such a lot, haver a peek and see if Terry's articles are there.  If you're approached, tell 'em you thought it was a sales lot and the perps might even try selling Terry's stuff.  Call the Police before Terry gets to them.  I know I'd be rabid."
179445,ecmilley,2008-03-31 18:39:00,2163,"on a chance what are the plate #'s on the atv and trailer, keep my eyes open for ya"
179450,Fishnfiend,2008-03-31 18:49:00,357,Watch kijiji....all sorts of dishonest people on there 'cause it isn't regulated like ebay...
179453,Bernie,2008-03-31 18:54:00,3190,I had one stolen as well Terry. Had just completed an overhaul on it and ready for the trail. Some dude stole it before I had a chance to use it. I will keep an eye out for it in case it ends up up here. God I hope they catch him.
179454,lew,2008-03-31 18:56:00,12767,"That's just plain lousy Terry, sure hope it all works out for ya.  Makes you sick doesn't it, when you can't leave anything around without some punk helping themselves to it ??"
179456,John,2008-03-31 18:58:00,2956,"Sorry to hear that Terry, that really sucks. I will put the word out in my area down here."
179457,Joey,2008-03-31 19:00:00,9122,That really bites Terry.  You certainly use it all the time and it will suck if you don't recover it.  I will keep my eyes peeled at all times for it.  Joey
179458,Roy,2008-03-31 19:06:00,13728,"Sorry it had to happen to you Terry. I only see one listed today on Kijiji. It's in Bracebridge:  THIS ATV IS IN EXCELLENT CONDITION AND DOES EXIST!! NOT LIKE ALOT OF ADS ON THIS SITE. THE ATV HAS A ULTRAMATIC TRANSMISSION, A DIGITAL INSTRUMENT PANEL, PUSH BUTTON ON COMMAND 2WD, 4WD AND 4WD DIFF LOCK. IT ALSO COMES WITH A 2500 LBS WARN WINCH AND SKID PLATES. THE ATV ONLY HAS 721 MILES ON IT. FOR MORE INFO OR SHOWING CALL ERIC AT 705-646-4276  They painted it quickly.  Good luck"
179461,brickNblock,2008-03-31 19:13:00,598," I got Quinte area covered for ya Terry. There are tons of ATV's and the like (used), always for sale out here. Like Wayne, Ive printed off a few cpies to distribute. Its no problem at all...everything is very close to me. dude's.........Wish you luck man. bNb"
179463,walleyejigger,2008-03-31 19:17:00,876,"sorry to hear Terry  also took a look at the local kijijji site  only one there is listed as an '05 but has a different rack on the back and no fairing  listed at an absolutely ridiculous price, total scam  http://sudbury.kijiji.ca/c-cars-vehicles-A...QQAdIdZ43870825"
179465,brickNblock,2008-03-31 19:18:00,598,You know what members..... We could be faster then the coppers on this. Look how far spread we are plus we are all always on the lookout for exellent deals.. If its not gone south or to europe I bet we have enough members to cover every part of Onatrio. Can a 'Observation' type thing be put in place at the Ont/Que border? Anyone know?..........Manitoba as well?
179467,irishfield,2008-03-31 19:22:00,26272,A good idea Pete.. but if it went to Quebec it was probably already there before sunrise. I figure someone's eyeballed Terry's place for awhile and checked it out a few times to see what was locked and how to leave with it. It's local and stripped.... or hidden away destine for a back country camp. The only thing that may turn up is the trailer abandoned.
179468,TJQ,2008-03-31 19:23:00,7806,"Terry, if you havent found it by the time i go to press ill put a page in for you....  well scour the earth for your stuff!!"
