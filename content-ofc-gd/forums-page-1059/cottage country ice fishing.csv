( even though I still fished in my hut!) The fish seemed off but we still managed to ice a bunch. Lost a few hogs to boot. All fish came on spoons, I gave up with minnows long ago and only use hardware. mostly Williams icejigs in  1/2 and 1/2. Couple of my buddies missed fish on minnows but just little guys.Something new for me was watching a big laker through my hole take swipes at my spoon maybe 4ft down in 120fow. he kept missing the spoon and after a min or so lost interest. It was a really cool to watch. Next morning I have the same thing happen, only a little smaller fish. didn't get him either. That being said. I caught all but one of my fish between 50-15fow in 120fow. I found that the bigger more aggressive fish where cursing higher up. Everything that marked high on the finder would chase the lure and hit. Hope I can make one more trip for some splake next weekend, weather dependent. If I dont not a bad way to end the year.    setting things up   first one of the day, he had a fat belly.    Dan with one      A nice surprise at the end of the day. It was a heavy fish between 8-10. quick pic and away she goes. When I first it at the hole it was covered with parasites. looked like weeds gowing off its back down towards its tail. I told my buddy to tail it and he looked at me stright faced and said ""are you serious"" after a few more runs and some line wrap they all most all came off. My friend had one to the hole in the middle of the week that was twice as thick I just couldnt get my hand on the fish. It was hugh at least 15lbs. Then the hook catches in the ice and the fish rips itself free. she doesnt fish much so I think I was more disappointed then she was.           Ryan"
