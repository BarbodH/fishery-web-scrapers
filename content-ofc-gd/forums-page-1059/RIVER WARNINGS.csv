180526,Dozer,2008-04-02 19:13:00,896,"Went to an eastern trib a few days back, I'm a complete noob to trout fishing, but thats not the point.  Anyways, drifting  the creek and all of a sudden I see aobut 10 - 15 massive logs floating by, so I decide to call it quits and pack up ( fished for about two hours and was cold ). Walking back the same pathway I took to get the that spot and theres a 5 foot thick ""creek"" that formed and flooded everything around me. The water was bubbling because the Earth was soaking it up and air was being replaced with water in the soil.  Thankfully there was a doowned tree that helped me get over, wet my shows but oh well.  Interesting experience I guess.  Careful out there."
