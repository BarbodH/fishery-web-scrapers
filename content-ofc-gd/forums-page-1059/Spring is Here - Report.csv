Was also surprised by a couple of carp that made their way into the spot.  Was a lot of fun to get out and fish some open water and there was a definite difference in fight between winter and spring carp. I almost forgot how hard they really fight!     A tricky spot to land them, should have brought the net but expected nothing but suckers.          Now got enough cat bait in the freezer for a couple of trips, gonna start searching for them later this week or early next week.  Anyone who wants to join in a scouting expedition for channel cats let me know. I have the bait and the spot knowledge. 90% sure they've moved in to one of my spots."

179686,bassmaster4,2008-04-01 01:20:00,801,good report! its great to finally see people getting out to fish some soft water
179698,Greencoachdog,2008-04-01 01:33:00,8163,Great report and pics!!!  I wonder how Carp would do for cutbait for Catfish?... It's bloody and stinky enough.
179745,steelhedrmatt,2008-04-01 02:37:00,278,"What do you do to the sucker meat when using it for cats?  I usually use dead stinky minnows.  I sure catch alot of suckers while steelheading, and I might just try keeping a couple for cat bait.  Do you have to let it rot a little before using it?  cut into strips/chunks?  If I can find an alternative to stinky minnows, that works as well, I might switch it up this spring."
179746,ccmtcanada,2008-04-01 02:40:00,7971,"Hey Rich...great report.  You took a break from posting for a while there, but I have to say I'm enjoying yours and sugarpacket's reports!  Good luck on the catfish baits!"
179786,Garry2Rs,2008-04-01 08:43:00,1425,"Chicken liver is a good catfish bait, that's easy to get at the grocery store. It's a little hard to keep on the hook. If sunfish etc. are picking it off I tie it in nylon netting material like a big roe bag. The nylon is available in dollar stores, as wedding veils etc."
179797,steelhedrmatt,2008-04-01 11:32:00,278,"I know about chicken livers.  We use them sometimes.  We leave them in the sun laid out on a tray for a day. They get stinky, and stick to the hook a little better as they dry out a bit.  Stinky minnows seem to work better though.  I was curious about the sucker meat because, every year the stink of the dead minnows seems to get to me a little more. ( my arms are too short to get away from my nose) Also, when using minnows, The garpike wont leave it alone.  I might just try sucker meat this year, to see if it helps with the stink and gars.  Cant wait for those cats!!!  http://i252.photobucket.com/albums/hh21/st...dr/Catfish5.jpg  http://i252.photobucket.com/albums/hh21/st...dr/Catfish3.jpg"
179805,SlowPoke,2008-04-01 11:54:00,2984,"Nice report Rich! I'm itching to get out, PM me and maybe we can hook-up this weekend if you're interested. My schedule is sketchy at this point. -Brian"
179831,Golfisher,2008-04-01 13:21:00,586,Spring is coming!
179846,Rich,2008-04-01 14:30:00,3927," Pretty simple, just fillet them and cut the meat into 2-3 inch chunks then freeze it. Works better for big cats than stinky minnows, worms or chicken livers IMO. Less annoying bullhead bites too."
179860,MuddyWater,2008-04-01 15:06:00,218,channel cats eh!! is their any out my way bowmanville on lake ontario ive been fishing here for a long time and i have never caught one bullheads like crazy even a musky but never a channel cat
