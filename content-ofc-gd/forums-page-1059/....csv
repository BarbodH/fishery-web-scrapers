179636,Casey123,2008-04-01 00:11:00,461,"Beauty Fish, Love the Grin, Ear to Ear.   WTG."
179640,douG,2008-04-01 00:18:00,2693,"See?  All you have to do is remember what I told ya.  Very nice, Glen and congratulations.  Nass whappure."

179653,Mike the Pike,2008-04-01 00:42:00,3421,WTG Glen you see its not so bad without your boat.  90 percent of us are without our boats so now you know how we feel.  Shore fishin can be better than the boat on some days.  Now answer Roy 's Question did you use the net and did you bring a tripod?  Nice fatty hybrid

179707,snag,2008-04-01 01:51:00,1932,Shore fishing?  Clothing?  Clean fingers?  It's like I don't even know you!        Dang nice bass rednick!

179713,Bernie,2008-04-01 01:57:00,3190,"That looks like a fun catch on light tackle Glen. Good stuff! By the way, have you figured out what is up with your engine? I may have missed an update on it. Last I heard it was possibly a fuel problem."
179721,Greencoachdog,2008-04-01 02:07:00,8163,...
179727,Bernie,2008-04-01 02:15:00,3190, Not great for customer relations on their part. Another shop looks like a good option Glen. Hope you get mobile on the water soon though. You catch many more like that from shore and you wont bother to get it fixed.
179755,jediangler,2008-04-01 03:30:00,1923,"Nice work GCD, those accidental videos are great. I have a few myself. That what the heck happened look, when you realize it's not taking a photo are priceless."

179505,bbog,2008-03-31 20:47:00,665,Great report and pictures as always GCD! Hope you get you boat back soon although it looks like you don't need it.
179507,fishinggeek,2008-03-31 20:49:00,325,Sweet fish!  Man I wish we had those in Ontario.

179524,ccmtcanada,2008-03-31 21:14:00,7971,"Wow...you really did go out fishing today!  Great stuff Glen...and that's one fine fish!  See?  Bly and I are not crazy for shore fishing....and just because we have a boat, we'll still continue to shore fish most of the time.  The boat will be for weekends....when we only have a few hours after dinner to fish, our fav shore spots is where you'll find us.  You think you'll have crowds there tomorrow now?? LOL"
179532,huntervasili,2008-03-31 21:30:00,1604,WTG there glen! glad to see even without a boa you can hook fish.

179549,Roy,2008-03-31 22:14:00,13728,"Beauty report, Bubba. That's some fish! I need to know though, did you use a net or did you lip'em? Using a tripod for the camera, or a rock?"
179555,bucktail,2008-03-31 22:21:00,1857,HEY keep the boat at home if thats what's going to happen. Awesome fish....is that a personel best on wipers?
