""Ya, shure, I tink I haff a lighter,"" he replied. Then reaching into his tackle box, he pulled out a Bic lighter 10 inches long.    ""Yiminy Cricket!"" exclaimed Sven, taking the huge Bic Lighter in his hands.    ""Vere dit yew git dat monster??""    ""Vell,"" replied Ole, ""I got it from my Genie.""    ""You haff a Genie?"" Sven asked.    ""Ya, shure. It 's right here in my tackle box,"" says Ole.    ""Could I see him?""    Ole opens his tackle box & sure enough, out pops the Genie.    Addressing the genie, Sven says, ""Hey dere! I'm a good friend of your master.    Vill you grant me vun vish?""    ""Yes, I will,"" says the Genie.    So Sven asks the Genie for a million bucks.    The Genie disappears back into the tackle box leaving Sven sitting there, waiting for his million bucks.    Shortly, the sky darkens and is filled with the sound of a million ducks....flying directly overhead.    Over the roar of the million ducks Sven yells at Ole.    ""Yumpin' Yimminy, I asked for a million bucks, not a million ducks!""    Ole answers, ""Ya, I forgot to tell yew dat da Genie is hart of hearing. Do yew really tink I asked for a 10-inch Bic?""  Hope you enjoyed! HH"
