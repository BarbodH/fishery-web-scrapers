180468,fishinfool,2008-04-02 17:58:00,366,Last year someone posted a site where you could look at the lakes via a satellite real time to see how the ice was doing. Does anyone know what the link is to that site? Kinda itchin to see how Balsam is doing so I can be prepared for the Crappie opener. LOL It's less than a month now...  Thanks Stan
