179443,Snypa,2008-03-31 18:36:00,25,"Nice looking jigs, I especially like the JUDGE, ICEFIRE & the FLIRT.  You can't go wrong with really any of those colors, they're all great, have you made any in pure black rabbit-hair yet ? its my best goto color !"
179485,jdmls,2008-03-31 19:58:00,575," L   M   F    A    O   .....honestly I did, people in the office were turning around !!!"
179501,FishFinder,2008-03-31 20:33:00,481,"If the riverwoods are too expensive for ya, try the raven jigs. $1.80 last time i was at Fish Online (Jane/Lawrence)  Good Selection I might add"
179533,kemper,2008-03-31 21:32:00,2232,"I could buy them, but ive spent 50 bucks on tying supplies and have already tied 40 jigs...there is no way I could ever find them for a buck each!  Just tied a batch of rabbit fur jigs that look great, ill get pics up later tonight"
179568,jat,2008-03-31 22:34:00,138,anybody know if Lebaron or basspro sells quality jigs heads for tying up some of these?
179678,jdmls,2008-04-01 01:12:00,575,they do in the fly fishing section but BPS charges lots of $$$
179757,kemper,2008-04-01 03:37:00,2232,"NEW BATCH IS UP  HOT OUT OF THE OVEN  these ones are mostly rabbit                  Im really liking the rabbit fur, ties alot faster and easier than the marabou.  I think the black rabbit with the brighter marabou tails are going to produce well...dang im going to need a field team if I keep it up at this rate....ive tied over 40 in two days!"
179995,kemper,2008-04-01 18:06:00,2232,Looks like the tribs are blown...maybe ill tie some HUGE ones?
179996,ccmtcanada,2008-04-01 18:07:00,7971,Hey Kemper...you selling any of yours?  I'd try a few out.....
179998,kemper,2008-04-01 18:08:00,2232,"Cliff Ive got more of these damn things than I could ever use, next time I see you on the water you can pick a couple out for free!"
180010,ccmtcanada,2008-04-01 18:18:00,7971,Sounds great...thanks a lot man!
180023,Ramble,2008-04-01 18:42:00,713,"What weight of jig heads? I tie my own flies, but havn't gotten to jigs yet. I have some idea's for small stream brookies.  In the summer long shanked hooks improve hook ups on days when the fish are biting light. Another colour you might want to try is brown rabbit fur. I have a racoon pelt at home the i use from time to time..the long guard hairs of the coon fur make for an interesting profile. those are just a few ideas.  Keep up the good work.  -R-"
180032,kemper,2008-04-01 18:54:00,2232,"No idea on the weight...theyre really light. More for profile than weight, I just fish them as I would a roe bag so weight isnt an issue"
180052,Spiel,2008-04-01 19:21:00,9065,"""Roe is for sissies, real men use jigs!""  ....I use roe.  But those are some sweet jigs, nicely done."
180053,Gerritt,2008-04-01 19:22:00,6129,  case and point.  G
180054,ccmtcanada,2008-04-01 19:24:00,7971,I also seem to remember another thread recently Kemper.....   Gotcha!! LOL
180059,kemper,2008-04-01 19:48:00,2232,"alright alright, so the slogan isnt entirely true..."
180074,Spiel,2008-04-01 20:42:00,9065,  ....So I'm not a sissy? I'm so confused.
180257,kemper,2008-04-02 02:15:00,2232,Well I was more going for IM not a sissy...  well have to have a poll...is Spiel a sissy or not?
179180,kemper,2008-03-31 01:30:00,2232,"Well today was my birthday, and instead of risking my life to battle steel I decided to stay home, and tie up some fantastic jigs. Had some coin from the family and went out the the bait shop to get the supplies and I was well on my way to becoming a jig master.  Here they are, be nice their my first ones!  The SUREFIRE   the JUDGE   the ICEFIRE   the PLAYBOY   the FLIRT   the FANTASTIC FIVE   These things are going to be put to the test hard this week, and many more are on the way.  Keep your eyes peeled for more jigs, and more steel!"
179183,jwoolley,2008-03-31 01:36:00,25,They look great. Good luck on the water.

179195,Greencoachdog,2008-03-31 01:53:00,8163,Great lookin jigs Kemper!  What weight heads? and hook size?
179199,kennyman,2008-03-31 01:58:00,737,Those look very cool. It'll be awesome when you catch a monster on a jig that you tied!  My vote is for the pink/white candy floss.
179200,mattyk,2008-03-31 01:58:00,2110,some nice looking lures.
179214,HTHM,2008-03-31 02:28:00,4082,Very nice work. Is it very difficult to do?

179242,Bly,2008-03-31 03:22:00,1556,"Happy Birthday Kemper!!  Nice looking jigs, look forward to hearing how they work/seeing the fish they catch!   I am a bit concerned though about one of them......looks a bit like an animal I really dislike seeing while fishing"
179246,ccmtcanada,2008-03-31 03:25:00,7971,Awesome work Kemper!  Those jigs will catch lots of fish for you I'm sure.  Thing is....jigs at night really suck...LOL.  I need stinky roe to catch them in the dark.  Happy birthday....hope you had a great one!
179248,kemper,2008-03-31 03:27:00,2232,"Bly, I almost named that pattern the skunk..but then i thought about it and decided it was probably the stupidest thing I could do! lol  Cliff, I dont fish at night. Problem solved."
179259,jdmls,2008-03-31 03:47:00,575,how much for an hour with the PLAYBOY BUNNY

179269,canadian_copper,2008-03-31 04:46:00,925,NICE BRO!!! THERES JUST SOMETHIN ABOUT CATCHIN A FISH ON SOMETHIN YOU HAVE MADE YOURSELF THAT MAKES IT THAT MUCH BETTER!!! IM TOO LAZY AND DONT HAVE PATIENCE FOR THAT SO I'LL JUST STICK TO MY RIVERWOODS. LOL
179293,kemper,2008-03-31 12:17:00,2232,"Ive also been too lazy, but I became too broke because at almost three bucks a piece riverwoods can get costly when you fish a river with alot of snags!"
179294,kemper,2008-03-31 12:19:00,2232,"  Looks good doesnt she?  haha thats a pink marabou tail/peach rabbit fur body. Its my favourite one that Ive tied so far, and its goin on the line first I have a good feeling about it."
179303,silverstreak,2008-03-31 12:50:00,146,Riverwood Jigs at $3.00 ? Try Tightlines in Pickering.....only $1.99 ea.
179304,Stoty,2008-03-31 13:02:00,2910,Nice lookin jigs there.  Yesterday was also my birthday!  There are a few of us eh!
179396,jdmls,2008-03-31 16:50:00,575," More like a lot of shopping carts......Sorry I had too, LOL....us regulars have learned to live with the chrome caged demons......I hooked a male yesterday that i watched dart right for the shopping cart....little bastrd, i lost my float and all !!!!"
179437,kemper,2008-03-31 18:17:00,2232,shopping carts are number one on the hazard list...stolen bikes are up there as well. I once landed a front bumper of a ford. No lie.
179439,buckster,2008-03-31 18:24:00,530,those shopping carts sure do hold fish lol
