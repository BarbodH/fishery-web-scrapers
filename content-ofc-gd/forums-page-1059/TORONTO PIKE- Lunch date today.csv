175708,snag,2008-03-24 20:34:00,1932, I just can't shut-up.  Bucktail. WoW!!  I have to admit that the anniversary of your inspiration is approaching. You caught a very nice pike on March 31 2006 in T.O. I've been following your career and remember that award winner in your arms.  I also agree with your reply.    That guy's a moron. He stalked you in a psychodelic haze. Probably has some Love cult on the islands and it readying himself for the wicken fertility rituals involving esox lovlious.
175709,bbog,2008-03-24 20:37:00,665,Great collection of fish you got there Snag. I'd be proud to catch any of them! WTG
175788,ehg,2008-03-24 23:46:00,2666,"Well SNAG you seem vindicated now. No question you've put in your time and caught many pike when their loaded with food and roe. Keep up the posts and fishing there, we are truly blessed to have such good fishing outside our offices in this urban setting. By the way back in the mid - late 90's i entered fish into Canadian Sportfishing contests and ended up winning 'Pike Angler of the Year' for all of Canada, a few years in a row, despite hundreds of entrants nationwide, just from a couple of trips down to Toronto Harbour in March. Many dozen and a half fish days with fish between 35 to 42 in. It rocks down there if you time it right.  Keep at it we have a special thing there for a brief time. Your posts always bring me a chuckle anyways.  Peace,  ehg"
175794,ccmtcanada,2008-03-24 23:55:00,7971,"So, what happened here?  Did you catch a fish Snag?  Come on...you expect me to believe that?  I have fished with Snag a few times and I can tell you that he's a straight up guy.  I take his word on each and every one of his catches....no questions asked.  Anyhow...keep em coming Snag...you are one of the reasons this board is so great!"
175889,Casey123,2008-03-25 01:25:00,461, That is the skinniest Pike I have ever seen!!!!
179550,napjohn8,2008-03-31 22:15:00,46,"i love how people blurt out there background, it makes it alot hardier for people to find the spots where people got these pike, however people do have a point that alot of gta areas aren't fishable for public access. We fish our spots so it doesn't become filled with newbies trying to fish the area we have found as our secret hole for years."
179581,Cookslav,2008-03-31 22:49:00,1457,"I don't blur because I generally fish remote areas but.... I have on alteast 3 occasions identified a spot by the banks and Soil in the picture lol!!!  No Joke. All 3 times I was right, and they were Pictures posted on this board, of 3 different areas. I won't elaborate out of respect for those people, but if they want to Blur...I understand why  I do hate to see the pics messed up but I do completly understand why one would do it. oh and uh... Nice fish there Snag"
179618,tdotfisherman,2008-03-31 23:34:00,317," In contrast to that opinion though, isnt the goal to spread the word to other people that may be interested in fishing, but have no idea the various opportunities open to them around the Greater Toronto Area just how much fun they can have?  I'm constantly trying to introduce my buddies into fishing, an activity which is extremely fun and enriching on many levels, not refusing to let them know information..  I believe in people doing most of their own legwork to find the best spots in the GTA, but cmon, aren't we taking this spot hiding/blurring thing just a tad too far guys and gals?"
179833,fishinggeek,2008-04-01 13:32:00,325,"I say to each their own.  If Snag wants to blur his fishing spots, that's his business.  In the GTA, I would be inclined to do the same (if I can stop getting skunked  ).  Similarly, if I owned a cottage paradise on a nearby lake that was small and had great fishing, I would only share that info with a few select friends, and definitely not post the lake name on here.  I have thoroughly enjoyed all your posts Snag, including the impressive fish pictures with the blurred spots.  Because of your posts, I have tried my luck on a number of times in the GTA.  With a few follows of varying sizes, I have yet to land a decent pike, which is a testament to your skills and hard time on the water.  Keep it up man!"
179840,corvette1,2008-04-01 14:15:00,1765,my musky was 48'' only 27lbs my pike 45'' 22'' girth 27lbs girth matters nice fish snag
179879,lookinforwalleye,2008-04-01 15:39:00,4399,Personally and this only my opinion I think blurring the background on a Toronto waterfront picture is silly and tells me alot.  For the record I used to catch Pike on the waterfront in the 60`s and early 70`s apparently they are thriving and doing well.
180079,sharper,2008-04-01 20:55:00,279,I'm a fan of your reports Snag so keep them coming. I'm also an avid shore fisherman when I don't have time to travel. Your truly a master at your craft and those pictures back it up.
175653,steverowbotham,2008-03-24 18:29:00,1800,"This post has just gone too far.  I made a post stating that I believed the pike was 8-10 pounds, looking at the picture again and again and again, I could have made a mistake, it is a nice fish, and as you said the picture doesnt do it justice.  I would still say around 14, but either way, nice catch, i hope this is done with."
175657,Stoty,2008-03-24 18:33:00,2910,I would say he was accurate with the 17lb range. Tis a nice fish for sure.
175665,highdrifter,2008-03-24 18:55:00,2534,"Alright G-Dawg..  You've had your fun.  We get the net yah?  Let it go already or get your missus to burp you after your bottle...   This thread is sooo last week!!  I do however love bleepin pike pics, you bleepin lucky bleepady bleep.  HD"
175678,snag,2008-03-24 19:33:00,1932,I'm done.  I'm just a sensitive guy.  I do care a lot for this site and my reputation in it.  Thanks for your replies.  S.
175684,snag,2008-03-24 19:44:00,1932," You really haven't missed anything. Just an oversensitive has-been with too much time on his hands!   Actually, That's kinda the point!   I didnt say or think you bashed me in any way. Your pic and comments were fantastic and helpful.   Your right. Done. and it does look 14. Heck, I'd even say 12lb. Looking forward to your reports.    Your such an idiot. I don't get burped until my diapers changed.  Done, done,  b-bye."
175687,Stoty,2008-03-24 19:50:00,2910,"  What I meant was, most people probably know the spots already, so not much point in blurring the pictures.  Not knocking your fish, because they are beauties, thats for sure. Good job.  Cheers, *Stoty"
175696,bucktail,2008-03-24 20:10:00,1857,Dan is right........ weighing the fish isnt necessary a quick tape on it and a photo. Hard to tell from that picture. Thats the bummer when you are fishing alone. If you want a real measurement you either have to keep the fish or keep it out of the water longer. I once had a muskie on by nmyself that was so big that after I realized its size I don't know what I would have done! 1 week to go on Lake O.... there is a 30 pounder waiting for someone. My avatar is a 48 inch fish but  I didnt measure it around so when I had the reproduction done at Advanced I told him to fit the girth. Turns out it was close to 24 inches around. I call it a 30 but it could have been anywhere from 27-33 lbs.    .    The reproduction         
173816,mepps,2008-03-19 22:42:00,1301,Beauty pike Snag!   I cant even begin to tell you how envious I am!
173859,snag,2008-03-19 23:54:00,1932," I have no reason to Bull on weight (except my own!) 8-10 is a joke.  As usual, the pic isn't great The pic doesn't show the thickness. Have a gander at my fingers. The head is out of the shot tilted above my shoulder, almost past my head. It could be 40"" but I didn't measure it. I just don't when I'm solo and the pike swallows a lure.  My scale is on the lipgrip that I begrudgedly had to use to reach it in the water. Otherwise, I knew my line would snap if I tried any leverage on a pike that size.  I've caught a few to know the difference.  The lipgrip is not digital so I gave it a 2 pound allowance for error. Mind you, that could also mean it's over 19 lds...  I have caught 5 pike in the GTA weighing 17-19lbs. weighed on a digital scale. I've now caught hundreds JUST in the Toronto area  You don't see me offering too many measurements as I am usually solo.  Honestly, the difference of a 10,15,20 pike is kinda silly to me. I often regret taking the essential time to collect data as opposed to getting that beautiful life form back to the water quickly and safely.  Just so y'all know."
173864,Greencoachdog,2008-03-20 00:16:00,8163,I was gonna say something about it being skinny and ugly... but I was afraid people would think I was talkin aboot the fish!
173890,ehg,2008-03-20 01:19:00,2666," Thanks for posting and the laugh. That's another nice fish.  cheers,  ehg"
173896,addict,2008-03-20 01:35:00,475,nice gator if that fish really is 19lbs what do u figure this one weighs  
173915,snag,2008-03-20 02:09:00,1932,"Beats me, that's a beauty. GBAY?  Edit: O.K. I'll guess.  This is a joke Steve, Buddy:  I think you MIGHT fit the same amount of 3 smallmouth bass weighing 6lds. each in that pike.  So my guess, looking at a picture but not really seeing it clearly would put that fish in the 13-18lbs. range.  How did i do?"
173932,steverowbotham,2008-03-20 02:33:00,1800,"just my opinion, its a beauty fish, i would never take that away from you.  i never said anything bad, just that its a solid 8-10 pounder, which I believe it is."
173933,Greencoachdog,2008-03-20 02:35:00,8163," Looks like a 25# or more to me, more prolly because it looks like it's been shot with buckshot."
173936,highdrifter,2008-03-20 02:37:00,2534," You failed, ya big failie von failstein..  That's a honkin fish. That's a big lad too though.   I'd say 43in, 22.5lbs.  Look at that cradle hold.. that look of a father holding his newborn..  He loves pike too!  HD"
173956,danc,2008-03-20 02:55:00,4677,"If I had to guess, I'd say 8 to 10 lbs. tops as well."
173963,snag,2008-03-20 03:00:00,1932," No problemo Steve,  I should also explain my vagueness.  This is the second time I've used a boca with a spring scale.  This was the first fish on my new 30# Boca that i got at BPS last week so I'm leery of it's accuracy.  I trust digital.  I just know what the scale said and the girth of the pike.  It's all good.  Wish you were there.  Look forward to that one day"
173971,steverowbotham,2008-03-20 03:21:00,1800,"i wish i was there too, ive been locked up writing reports, tight lines"
173972,richyb,2008-03-20 03:24:00,774,"The "" buckshot"" pike is definitly the bigger pike .. i would guess that mr buckshot is about 20 pounds.  My biggest pike is 14 pounds and the original post pike doesnt look bigger than that ... just my opinion .. beauty fish .. im jealous !!!!   pictures are wierd tho .. i took a pic of a 6 pound whitefish and it ended up looking like it was 20 !!!!"
173975,danc,2008-03-20 03:36:00,4677,The bottom here is that weighing your fish is an obsolete practice. It serves no purpose. It's hard on the fish and leaves your results open for debate. A quick photo and length measurement is all you need. Who cares how much it weighed on your scale?  Field weights are not accurate anyways.
173978,The Urban Fisherman,2008-03-20 03:46:00,2050,"right on dude!  Thanks for the report as usual Snag!  I'll be sure to post any reports I can come April when your season is closed and mine is still open on erie! heh  Cheers, UF"
173991,chickenhawk,2008-03-20 05:59:00,612,seein alot more fish with lamprey marks on them its getting pretty bad especially the bows.....
174037,snag,2008-03-20 12:04:00,1932," Agreed,  However, If anyone thinks I don't know the difference between a 8-10lbs. fish in my hand and a 17-18lbs. is in serous error.  Guess I'll have to do better!"

174203,richyb,2008-03-20 18:11:00,774,so what was the official length and weight of the buckshot pike ?
174221,addict,2008-03-20 19:01:00,475,"never weighed the buckshot pig just wanted her to live another day.but i would say shes well over 20,the buckshot i think was from spawning.all the blood u see is from my well lacerated fingers,caught a few rakers trying to get her in.going up north soon to moosebunks back yard to try for another pig.watch for the post."

The follows were mostly in shallower areas.  The follows were big fish too.  But I think the BIG ones are still in water deeper than Neil Pearts lyrics.   She was from the deepest spot.  My scale said she was 19#'s but I think 17-18#'s is more realistic.  She swallowed the lure pretty deep. Luckily, my spreaders did the trick and the surgery was quick and minor.
