179706,Gerritt,2008-04-01 01:49:00,6129,I would try my best to not let it sit for more then 24 hours.... but that is just my opinion. I do the same with my meats.. if I do not intend to eat it that day I will freeze it... I am a stickler when it comes to meats and their handling.   G
179708,livinisfishin,2008-04-01 01:54:00,661,"Well i left it in my g.f's fridge and the second day she threw it in the freezer because she thought it was turning. I remember when i worked at food basics in the meat deptartment we would get fresh fish in , and it would be on the shelves until the day after the expiry date at a reduced price so the shelf life there could easily be a week or a bit more maybe    By the way what would anybody recomend for a seasoning for crappie, i would like to pan fry it rather then deep fry...even though i know deep fried is delicious."
179709,huntervasili,2008-04-01 01:54:00,1604,i'd say 48hrs have yet to get sick... But that is fridge thawed mind you
179710,bbog,2008-04-01 01:56:00,665,Try Original flavour Fish Crisp. It does not overpower the delicate taste of Crappie.
179716,Bernie,2008-04-01 02:01:00,3190,Freeze it or eat it is my rule of thumb. Fresh off the fish and into the pan is best.

179723,bbog,2008-04-01 02:09:00,665,Exactly!
179724,livinisfishin,2008-04-01 02:11:00,661,Excuse me while i get technical yes this is a website. I think you get what i was trying to get across.
179728,richyb,2008-04-01 02:18:00,774,I have kept fish in the fridge up to 4 days and never got sick from it ..
179773,fishing,2008-04-01 04:17:00,167,"FRESHLY CLEANED fish, free of water, placed in COLD area, will be good for about 4 or 5 days. Last a bit longer if salted. Keep them DRY all the time. It's hard to do it in summer though."
179808,ehg,2008-04-01 12:08:00,2666,   These are the best answers.  Most fish has good shelf life due to lack of blood. Being a chef i've learned this over many years.  There is a huge difference between fish cooked fresh as opposed to frozen/ thawed then cooked. Fresh is obviously the best.  ehg
179813,steelhedrmatt,2008-04-01 12:18:00,278,"If you have to store fish in the fridge, plastic is Bad. It speeds the deterioration of the flesh.  In a glass or stainless bowl, covered with plastic wrap, you'll be good for 5 days. Dont let the plastic wrap touch the fish.  I used to work in a fish plant, supplying Sobey's, Loblaws, Costco, and about 200 restaurants.  We would sometimes warehouse the fish for up to three days before shipping, Then they put it on their counter for up to 5 days.  This is not including the 2-3 days from the ocean/lake to our warehouse.  Give it a rinse under cold water before cooking, and you shold be fine!!"
179814,BITEME,2008-04-01 12:23:00,1969,My 2 cents  If you can smell the fish its past its prime generally Fresh fish has no smell if it has a smell use it in chowder ....unless of course its really rank then you can use it for dog food
179821,wallyboss,2008-04-01 12:55:00,1095,"To pan fry.  flour  salt and pepper to taste, I use lemon pepper.  pat dry fish and put in flour mixture then panfry in butter."
179835,camillj,2008-04-01 13:40:00,1988,It will last at least 24 hours in the fridge ... and longer if the door is closed ... even longer if the power is on and the frige is functional....  Much less is you have teenagers and the fish has already been cooked
