180177,Maverick,2008-04-02 00:42:00,371,"My cottage is up by Pembroke. We get some decent walleye, pike (caught one close to 20 last year) , big cats and sturgeon and lots of nice bass, the odd 5 pounder. There are no musky that I know of in my part of the river but there might be in that part. It's a nice place though and I love every minute I spend there. Good luck fishin'."
