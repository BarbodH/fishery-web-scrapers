179938,snag,2008-04-01 17:09:00,1932,"Alo'   I decided to go out in/on the inflatable kayak yesterday.  Instead of going where I knew the fish were, I decided to try some new spots.  Yeah, real smart on the last open day for pike!??  Needless to say, no action till after 2pm.  Here's the exciting part:  My New PB!  I'm reeling in and THUD! My line stops, I pull up and I feel it move a little.  She's got weight, I think my 30# braid is gonna snap!  My heart is pounding. Sweat rolls down my furrowed brow and drips on my snarled lips.  Here she comes    She's a beauty!    I can't believe my eyes!    Sadly, a couple of head shakes and she's gone.  She definitely beat my previous PB: (Plant Buttox)    So I tried some new spots whilst I froze me arse off. Finally got to a spot only accessible by boat and had a couple follows. I lost 2 fish and hooked this one. I decided to dock the kayak to land her instead of risking a frigid, watery grave.  ""You there on the dock, I seem to have a hook in my face""   Lip piercing gone wrong   Wee fatty    On the shed door behind me, this promo poster for Jimmy Buffets' Margaritaville tour was posted:   All Hail the God of the slackers  See you in May,  Snag"
179942,Joey,2008-04-01 17:12:00,9122,"Hahahahahaha, I love it!!!!  Awesome PB Snag, definately beats the old one  Joey"
179946,ccmtcanada,2008-04-01 17:16:00,7971,"LOL Snag....could almost taste that PB...dont ya hate it when they get away at the last minute like that?  So, Kayak in Lake O (if that's where you were)....do you get to use two lines even if it's docked??  Great report....gotta let them spawn now so you can catch more pike next year!!!  I see a lounger on a rapala in your future....maybe a la-z-boy!!!"
179955,tbayboy,2008-04-01 17:24:00,1497,"So thats where I left my chair!  Sounds like a fun, if cold, way to go into the break.  April is going to be very long I think.  I gotta figure out what to fish for this month"
179957,ccmtcanada,2008-04-01 17:27:00,7971, Steelies!!!!  Fish for steelies!!!!
179973,Golfisher,2008-04-01 17:45:00,586,"Nex time, aim higher: there must be a street bench somewhere in the harbour!  As always, very entertaining report!"
179978,fishinggeek,2008-04-01 17:50:00,325,"Hey Snag, did you weigh your PB?  How much did she weigh?  From the 3 pictures, looks like a solid 5 pounder.  Amazing report.  I wouldn't have the guts to float in an inflatable this shortly after ice-out."
179979,lookinforwalleye,2008-04-01 17:51:00,4399,How do those portable plastic/rubber boats stand up to those big trebles?
179981,highdrifter,2008-04-01 17:53:00,2534,"ppfffff...  That chair can't be more than 30in, tops..  Time for chrome budday..  cheers! HD"
179991,Bly,2008-04-01 18:04:00,1556,can always count on your reports for a bit of humor.....Thanks Snag!!  Loved the new PB. I have a few that look almost as good in back yard!
179994,bbog,2008-04-01 18:06:00,665,Exactly what I was thinking
180002,CLofchik,2008-04-01 18:10:00,854,"Which yak is that, how'd it handle, wind, paddles like crud?  Thinking of an inflatable belly boat as my fishing toy for this year but an inflatable yak would be interesting too.  How small does it fold down?"
180004,Victor,2008-04-01 18:12:00,1609,hmm. hopefully a better hookset next time.  Thanks for the entertaining report!
180029,snag,2008-04-01 18:53:00,1932," I heard you received a ""warning"" about the Gans report. Dang!   2 lines eh, never thought of that. Hmmmmmm    Thought that was your chair. Try cleaning it once in awhile.   Actually, they had a salvaged bench near there that drifted in from scarborough!   Sadly, she got off before the scale was necessary......."
180031,snag,2008-04-01 18:54:00,1932," poorly   Did you get ""it"" up?     A little bleach helps   Hey Barnie,  Look at the Gans thread,  I used your ""new member"" thread for the opening line!    I love it. Not built for speed but it is quite versatile. Lightweight and comfortable. Folds up quickly, 34"" by 12"" approx. and weighs about 20lbs.   Yeah, she bent my hook!"
180044,Reef Runner,2008-04-01 19:12:00,981,"Nice Work SNAG!!!!  I went 3 days and no pike to account for.  Will try again in May.  Congrats on the PB, lol, I personally target Muskokas though.  reefrunner"
180080,lew,2008-04-01 20:56:00,12767,Who woulda thunk a Torontonian would ever throw junk in the harbor   Always enjoy your fish'n tales bud and will be lookin forward to more of your adventures when you get back to piking in May
180170,mepps,2008-04-02 00:22:00,1301,Well done! hahah
180173,Ben_Daniels,2008-04-02 00:31:00,435,"to bad the PB got away  ...Nice little Piggy though, your crazy going out in the yak!  -Ben"
180184,tibbs,2008-04-02 00:53:00,650,Imagine what the size of your next pb is going to be!  Nice pike!
180256,Greencoachdog,2008-04-02 02:14:00,8163,  That chair can't be anymore than 2 1/2 lbs... maybe 3 with the muck on it... can't you see it's skinny and malnourished!!!  I don't see what's so funny about this thread!... can't y'all se that chair has been mishandled and mistreated!!!   All hail the Slacker!!!
180285,ehg,2008-04-02 03:20:00,2666, That's a solid 3-5 pounder.  Congrats on the decent catches on the last day.  ehg
