Then drop some Zippo lighter fluid into each bearing (no need to remove them) put the spool onto the pin and work the fluid in...repeat until the thing ZINGS....  The lighter fluid is naptha which breaks down and cleans any risidual oil or packed grease inside the bearings...DO NOT OIL or re-grease...not ever. Just clean the reel and repeat this process at anytime the reel seems to slow a little, not that it ever will...  If you are concered about damage, don't be...I own several reels all of which I use this process on and all of which start up faster than most of the same species. All of my reels are very well cared for and some that are in excess of 10 years old still look and run better than new!"

179763,jdmls,2008-04-01 03:49:00,575,"the only way to get the bearings out of the stanton is to bang em out with a screwdriver and a mallet. The bearings are pressure fitted in so you have to go through the centre of one bearing to get to the inside of the other with a screw driver and tap it out, the n doo te same fro th other side...it pretty much impossible to do without ruining the bearings, but figure if you have to take them out , its to change them so they old ones would be scrap anyway...."
