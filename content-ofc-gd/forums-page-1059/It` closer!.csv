179626,Clampet,2008-03-31 23:48:00,1947,"Peepers are tree frogs, aren't they? They raise quite the racket!"
179767,OhioFisherman,2008-04-01 04:06:00,6623,"To tell you the truth Clamp-It I don`t know for sure if they are tree frogs, I don`t think so. We have tree frogs here and they are a lot bigger than the peepers. They seem to be little guys, about as big as a thumb nail and when they are making noise the area below their mouth seems to swell to as big as they are.  Early yet, they will disappear with the next cold weather then be back again when it warms up again. They seem to disappear completely after the mating season. I get a few bullfrogs and leopard frogs in the yard also no big numbers of them though.  Seen some areas here were there seemed to be thousands of leopard frogs, some in bad places for them to hang out."
