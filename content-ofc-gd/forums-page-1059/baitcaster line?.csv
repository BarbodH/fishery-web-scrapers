179771,bow slayer,2008-04-01 04:12:00,1074,time to spool up the new baitcaster.(Abu 6500 C3) I will be using it for casting musky/pike baits as well as trolling bodybaits. What line would be the best all round for this and what test? I was thinking braid but i think there are better options for casting. thanks
179774,richyb,2008-04-01 04:18:00,774,I always use  power pro  in 50 lb test .. i cast all day long and have no complaints..  With it being a smaller diameter than mono of the same lb test you get longer casts .  just my opinion tho ..  I feel like i can haul up a submarine without breaking off and also the braid acts like a knife in the weeds when the big ones make their runs ..
179781,lew,2008-04-01 08:23:00,12767,For casting I like 65# Power Pro & trolling I use 80# and have 130# fluoro leaders on everything.  Lotsa guys are moving up to 80 pound for casting also so as not to have the line snap on a backlash with heavy baits.
179783,Garry2Rs,2008-04-01 08:30:00,1425,"I was one of the guys who went to 8o pound PowerPro, or Tuff Line XP for casting. My Bucktails were weighing in at around 3 ounces and would break 50 or 65 pound test when I threw a backlash. Keep in mind that 80 pound PowerPro is only the diameter of 18 pound mono, so it's not as bulky as it sounds."
179820,Raf,2008-04-01 12:52:00,3495,i use a mix of 80 and 100 for casting.  same for trolling.
179828,Sinker,2008-04-01 13:19:00,8692,"I've  been using 50lb for the last 3 seasons, no break offs yet. I think I'm gonna go with 80 this year though.....just because its time to change my line.  Go with the braid though.....can't beat it on a casting reel IMO.  Sinker"
179847,muskymike,2008-04-01 14:37:00,772,I also use 80# and 100# Power Pro for casting. I havnt had a breakoff yet with it.
