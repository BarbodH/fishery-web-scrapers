Just got into fishing in the last couple of years and want to LEARN everything I can.  A great day is time in the canoe trying to figure out where the fish are hiding and what they want!  Looking forward to continue learning from you guys and gals.  I live and work in Toronto.  I've seen a few threads, so headed out before work this morning and hooked into this baby!  Not a soul out there. Did the ""politically correct"" thing and blurred the shot.  Jogger took the pic. Nice lady too.  Cheers,  Gans   "
