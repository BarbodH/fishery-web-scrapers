Suddenly, the light turned yellow, just in front of him. He did the right thing, stopping at the crosswalk, even though he could have beaten the red light by accelerating through the intersection.  The tailgating woman was furious and honked her horn and screaming in frustration as she missed her chance to get through the intersection, dropping her cell phone and makeup.  As she was still in mid-rant, she heard a tap on her window and looked up into the face of a very serious police officer. The officer ordered her to exit her car with her hands up. He took her to the police station where she was searched, finger printed, photographed, and placed in a holding cell. After a couple of hours, a policeman approached the cell and opened the door. She was escorted back to the booking desk where the arresting officer was waiting with her personal effects.  He said, ""I'm very sorry for this mistake. You see, I pulled up behind your car while you were blowing your horn, flipping off the guy in front of you, and cussing a blue streak at him. I noticed the 'What Would Jesus Do' bumper sticker, the 'Choose Life' License plate holder, the 'Follow Me to Sunday-School' bumper Sticker, And the chrome-plated Christian fish emblem on the trunk, Naturally...I assumed you had stolen the car.""  Priceless."

I'm at the intersection (lighted) in Sundridge Ontario and I was trying to turn right on the red to head south down hwy 11--anyway traffic coming down 11 was very busy and it was not safe to pull out----this nice lady in her mercedes suv starts honking at me as though I should run it and possibly put my family in peril.  Anyway when green I turned right and of course she blows by me and you guessed it flips me the salute.  Now I've been driving for 30 years so I have a rough idea whats up--kind of uncalled for on her part.  But I think the big issue here is ""Are we not in cottage country to slow down and relax""  More and more it's race outta town and then try and cram as much as possible into a day and a half and basically take your stressed life and move it north for the weekend.---anyone caught in that long weekend traffic nightmare will confirm.  Anyway this is not as much a rant as an observation.  Bushart"
