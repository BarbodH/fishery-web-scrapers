Maybe I should be suspicious.  Toronto Star Image  I don't get why people are threatened by unoccupied office towers actually using less electricity?  Or even reducing waste?  Or  folks cleaning their garage?  Or saving for their retirement?  Why does this stuff pith you off?  No conspiracy theory would convince me that wasting stuff you need is a good thing."

179841,Guest lundboy,2008-04-01 14:16:00,0," Oh my....  And Al Gore and the ""Climate Change"" crew aren't fear mongers?  I fail to see how buying gold/silver even as a hedge against economic changes is ""fear mongering"".  Gold has gone from $350 to over $800 in the last 6 years,  silver has gone from $8 to $18 in 4 years and shows signs of that trend continuing. Pretty good ROI I would say.  Theodore Butler knows the score about precious metals, he's not fear mongering anything.  Have any of you noticed that the price of flour, bread, food in general has gone up by about 25% average in the last 5 months and there's no sign of it stopping anytime soon?  It doesn't matter what the cause is (pick your favourite), it just is. Have you not noticed that shelves in the grocery stores are more empty than usual these days?  Loblaws, Sobeys, Dominion all have several random shelves constantly empty at any given time during the week.  So does having a stash of storable food hurt, even 72 hours worth?  Yep I guess so according to some.  The links are only useless to those that refuse look at the possible bigger picture.  And please don't try to associate the New World Order with anything benevolent to the human race."
179648,Guest lundboy,2008-04-01 00:25:00,0,"Well guys, it's been fun but it's time to move on.  Lot's of people here know what I've been getting at with my posts regarding the ""Earth Hour"" experiment.  Many, many, possibly hundreds of thousands of people say that there is more to the ""environmental"" angle than meets the eye. People that are far more researched and knowledgeable, both academically and historically minded people, than I could ever hope to be. I have given you the links and references to the works of some of these people. You can choose to ignore their work or you can investigate further.  You can dismiss it as ""conspiracy theories"". All I can say is I have studied their works with a skeptical eye since 2001. I've looked at both sides, studied both arguments. I know the conclusion I have come to and it's because of the sheer volume of evidence. It doesn't take a biology scholar to see what has and is going on. This evidence points to a lot more insidious agendas at play than just having your environmental feelings preyed upon by a bunch of money grubbing bankers and politicians.  So, you can do what you want with the info I have given you. All you have to do is watch a few videos and read a few books. What if the evidence is right? Will it hurt you to have an open mind and look at it, THEN form your own opinions after seeing it? As the ""Climate Change"" people have been advocating all along, isn't it better to take steps now to be prepared for what is coming, than to sit and do nothing?  Does it not make sense to you to take some of the effort and money that you would use to ""Save the Earth"" and instead invest it in your OWN family's best interest? Something tangible? The Government of Canada is not constantly running ads on TV to prepare for 72 hrs of emergency for nothing. Many believe (myself included) that it will be longer, much longer.  -Get yourself some storable food, about a years worth for each member of your family if possible -Make sure you have somewhere to goto that is away from the cities -Make sure you have something to make clean water from a river or lake -Convert some of your money to gold and silver (in your hand) while it's still affordable -Have a plan  If it ends up you never need it Great, eat it, sell it, donate it to charity.  That's the only point I'm trying to make. There is good evidence we all need to prepare and we need to do it now.  A few final links for anyone that IS interested in getting prepared:  http://www.efoodsdirect.com/ http://www.investmentrarities.com/tb-archives.html http://www.cdncoin.com/bullion_dept.html http://www.newswithviews.com/Evensen/greg26.htm"
179714,POLLIWOGG,2008-04-01 02:00:00,835,I haven't read all the posts so maybe someone has already come up with this.  I propose that next year instead of saving an average of 10cents worth of electricity and driving 20 miles or so to a bon fire or whatever party to celebrate saving the said electricity that next year everyone turn on a light and stand under it for an hour and don't move.  If you look at the environmental foot print of earth day I suspect it was a disaster because we made a party out of it..

I just don't want to get a headache from it all especially when past experiences have taught me that some waters will never be fully explored and discernment does not come easily.

178780,Ramble,2008-03-30 06:22:00,713,"Well Lundboy since everyone else seems to be avoiding confrontation i'm going to take the bait.  YOU better believe i'm rolling my eye's at you're little theory here. You have all this research ""proving your point"" RIGHT, but in the process you're ignoring the information on what actaully is happening.  You'd better look up CLIMATE CHANGE again.... see what what the syptoms are...then have a look around.  Besides not agreeing with Climate Change for whatever reasons. What HARM is their in living more sustanably within the environment? It doesnt make sence to me to fight things that will improve our quality of life.  Maybe a better way of looking at climate change is to make a list of things you like about nature in your area, and around the world, then research what climate change will do to those things.....  Then think about whether you want to risk losing those things over something that's preventable.  The cost of dealing with the climate chnage/pollution problems in our society is nothing compared to the good it will do people to make these changes.    One of the fundimental problems in our culture is that people only care about themselves, and do things for based how it will influence them.... you need to consider how these types of choices/problems will impact your grand children. Even at the tender age of 22, i want my future grand kids to be able to fish/hunt/canoe/hike in the same places, with the same species around that existed when my grand father covered and i want it in the same state or improving their whole life.  You can dig up all the info you want that says it isn't happening cause there is more then twice that much stuff saying it is happening.....Did i mention climate change has reached a general consensus in the scientific community?   So far none of you sources would be valid or classified as RESCENT in any of my classes.... The news article isn't scientific...and the site would not be classified as crediable....Wikipedia is a HUGE NO, NO. It's an good place to start to get background info, but should NEVER been used as FACT. See if you can dig up some open biased reports which are peer reviewed that support your claim published aftter 2000. Then we'll have some thing to talk about.  -Dave"

178832,Guest lundboy,2008-03-30 12:53:00,0," I am NOT denying that climate change exists.  Haven't said that once.  In your blindness to the bolster your position you have chosen climate change in this, because that's what you have (you and millions of others) been made to see.  I'm not using wiki as a defacto reference, only as an illustration of where the the WWF started from.  I can't provide you with everything that I have researched and know about the ""climate change"" agenda that is something you will have to research for yourself.  Because until you do, (and I mean real research not what you hear in the classroom, news and read in the papers.... all of which comes from government paid talking points... roll your eye's some more if you like)  you will continue to fall for the globalist agenda that is using climate change to tax the crap out of us and take control of every aspect of every thing we do, with an ultimate goal of ridding the world of 80% of it's human infestation.  The reason you don't know about the large consensus of scientists that DON""T agree with the UN reason of ""Global Warming"" being caused by humans is because of the world wide suppression of their studies.  This too you will need to find out for yourself, because until you do, you will be rolling your eyes.  ""you need to consider how these types of choices/problems will impact your grand children"" I truly do care about the impact to my grand children and yours.  One should actually worry about the impact to even one's children, because they have accelerated this.  It will happen before 2012.  It won't be the overheated earth that will get us, it will be the taxes, one world government, enslavement, tyranny, one child policies (if even one allowed), induced food shortages, Genetically Modified Organism pollution, unheard of infectious disease.  You may not believe what I have stated here,  you may not understand.  But that's OK.  You were programmed not to.  You can read though.  History plays a key roll in our future.  The people doing this are in it for the long haul, and have continued their efforts generation after generation to this day.  ""So far none of you sources would be valid or classified as RESCENT in any of my classes....""  You are currently in University or a teacher? You want to know how this pertains to you?  Read Charlotte Iserbyt's book... I'll give you the link for the PDF again: http://www.deliberatedumbingdown.com/MomsPDFs/DDDoA.sml.pdf  READ THE BOOK, then you will have an idea of what type of manipulation you have been subjected to and can argue your point.  Then get back to me.  Then I will point you to another researcher that ties Charlotte's (purely historical with government documented references) book,   with the globalist eugenics agenda (which by the way includes global warming).  Below is a brief time line of what has transpired toward a one world government since 1891, I suggest you dig deep on any of the points, and find out the role it plays in getting us to be where the globalists want us to be.  (I have a more detailed timeline, but not enough space to upload the pdf)  All I am doing is planting the seeds to wake you up. If you won't look further than what the system tells you up front, than I can't help you. These are not MY ""theories"". These are well researched government policies (by researchers that have been tracking this a long time) a lot have been released into public record, or through freedom of information act (FOIA) demands or by the globalist own words.  I don't take credit for others work, I just present it to others in hopes that they will wake up and pass it on, so that everyone knows what really is coming, and we may be able to at least prepare to some extent.  UN Agenda 21 is real my friend, and it's coming to your backyard."

All these dangers are caused by human intervention... The real enemy, then, is humanity itself.""  In the past, the Club of Rome has resorted to deceptive tactics in order to support their plans. In 1972, the Club of Rome, along with an MIT team released a report called ""Limits to growth."" The report stated that we were to reach an environmental holocaust by the year 2000 due to overpopulation and other environmental problems. Support for their conclusions was gathered by results from a computer model. Aurelio Peccei, one of the founders of the Club of Rome, later confessed that the computer program had been written to give the desired results.  Also research: Margaret Sanger-Founder of Planned Parenthood, a negative eugenics organization.  Remember it wasn't that long ago...  1950s that eugenics was being carried out on the public, by the forced sterilization and imprisonment of people the US Government considered to be ""of poor breeding"", mentally unstable, or diseased. Already the Global Warming propaganda is pushing one child policies for The West, or face heavy taxing.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compulsory_sterilization"
