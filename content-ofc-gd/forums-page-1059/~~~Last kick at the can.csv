We're at the lake. With 2""of crusted snow, we set up, and bump, dam missed him, oh well it's early yet, by 9 still no phish, and Walleyedreamer, comes around the corner, followed by his troop, so after a quick ""How you do How you do"" WD is poppen holes here and there and over there, and as we all got settle""Phish On""  Great the phish are here, then Slug gets a hit, and like last week loses it Dam here we go again, then his other rod gets a hit, and with Karol, help, he has one in the hand, but Karol gave him the thumbs down so back it went  Well thing sloooowwwed riiiggghhhtt doooowwwnnn, so Slug, and Wd decide to head over to the other side of the bay, where WD always catches phish,so away they go and the troop head out with them, while I stayed put. I had at one time 3 hits in a row losing 2 very nice Trouts, and a small one, had a very friendly Lab come over to say hi, tried to steal my phish, and his owner came over and I said to him ""Nice trick you taught him, but go catch your own"". After about 1.5 hrs. the guys return carrying 2 small Lakers, and decide to head home, about 30 min. later I get a light tap, then Slug get a hit, and loses it then my rod next to him get a hit and he's all over it and lands this nice Laker  Got quiet for a while some local came out for a walk  Well about 2:30 we decide to pack it in, so we bid a sad farewell to another couple of locals who help clean up, for us.  And we headed off the lake, and again back up the hill for the last time this winter    We got to get a sled.    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Oh yea we spotted this guy south bound on 11  What dose he know that we don't"
