179812,BITEME,2008-04-01 12:16:00,1969,Okay here is the deal  One of my best Technicians has been pimped away from me and will be heading out to Alberta. some guys have left before and the tradition with our small group is to all kick in some money and my Boss will match whatever we raise. Anyway i have outfitted 2 guys that left aready to fish and they were very happy. Now the question and I'm way out of my element here My Tech has an intrest in FLY FISHING I have roughly 500.00 to spend on a setup  before anyone gets to this point i will be doing the shopping locally at my favorite shop.  I would like to get a rod and reel all spooled up and ready to go maybe a few flies and possibly a cheap vest  rod weight is my first question line would be second and anything else that would help in selection would be great Like I said I'm way outside this loop im an anchor dragger  THANKS Peter

179857,MuddyWater,2008-04-01 15:02:00,218,first of all what species are they targetting because their is alot of sizes and weights for fly rods and a little tip to help you out spend most of the money on the rod and line the reel doesnt do much but hold some line on it gona need some more info to help ya out

That'd make me pretty happy!!!"
