180139,Roy,2008-04-01 23:39:00,13728,"Happy Birthday Rocket! You come from a famous family. He might have told you this story as a kid but your great uncle ""Whimsey"" was quite the mascot. He did all the initiation rites on OFC. His only props were a broom handle and a menthol cigarette. He was hilarious I tell ya! TJ or one of the mods might be able to dig up a video of ol' Whimsey in action for your family album.  Have a great day, Kid."
