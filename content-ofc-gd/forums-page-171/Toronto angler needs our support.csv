919788,Dave Bailey,2015-06-13 00:44:00,1641,"Some of you may be aware of the annual event held at the Scadding Court Community Centre in Toronto. Each year, the centre's swimming pool is temporarily turned into a fishing pond, and the event is a big hit with the local children. Here's a news article about it:  http://metronews.ca/news/toronto/1392257/toronto-swimming-pool-set-to-become-a-fishing-hole-for-local-children/  Well, some animal rights activist has started a petition to prevent it:  http://metronews.ca/news/toronto/1393467/animal-rights-activists-outraged-by-indoor-fishing-event-in-toronto/  I have already sent the organiser, Mr. Kevin Lee, an e-mail expressing my support for him, if anyone else wishes to stand up for fishing, you may contact him at: [email protected]  My letter:  Mr. Lee, I have heard about the attempts to prevent you from holding your annual fishing event, and I wish to let you know that you have my full support. I live in Pickering, so I'm not really able to offer assistance, but might I suggest that to counter the petition, started by Lucas Solowey, that you start a petition yourself. I feel certain that, given the support the event has received over the years, you will be able to gain more signatures, in less time, than he will."

I was one of them  until I met friends who did teach me and I loved it. having read the story they object  the ""pool"" idea, I may be wrong.  They used/do the same thing at the Sportsmen show where you fished a trout 'pond' inside the exhibition and not a word was said and how about the demo tanks where the celebs would hold seminars!  My dad taught me how to grow vegetables and others how to catch fish!"
919795,Dave Bailey,2015-06-13 01:27:00,1641,"having read the story they object the ""pool"" idea, I may be wrong.  No, they object to the entire idea of fishing, period."
919803,Freshtrax,2015-06-13 02:14:00,2215,"This is crazy,  I am actively trolling  the Toronto vegetarian  association on Facebook now.  They are the ones putting up all the fuss.   If some others joined me it may be fun."
919845,Dave Bailey,2015-06-13 15:25:00,1641,"Apparently a 'compromise' was reached, but I don't think it's satisfactory. One pool will have fish, so people can see them, and another will have toy fish for catching. Here's a report from Global News, which presents the animal rights position with no critical analysis whatsoever. http://globalnews.ca/video/2052314/let-them-fish-compromise-reached-between-animal-rights-activists-and-indoor-fishing-program"
919855,Freshtrax,2015-06-13 16:36:00,2215,"I think you misunderstood, there will be an option to catch toy or real fish."
919866,Gallie,2015-06-13 20:12:00,1215,"These people will never stop they threaten the very lifestyle that most of us here enjoy. What ever happened to minding your own damn business? I guarantee every single one of these ""activists"" does something that would upset most of us but you dont see us cramming our ideals down their throats! Im starting to think i might mount a fish replica on the front of my ranger and a fake moose head on the back...good conversation starter?"
919869,netminder,2015-06-13 20:22:00,514,"“Taking them out of their natural environment is quite startling to them,” said Solowey, who is the interim general manager of the Toronto Vegetarian Association.  No, they are farm trout. The same fish most ""vegetarians"" already think are ok to eat.  I really hope there wasn't a compromise either. What does that teach the children then? Whine enough and you'll get everyone else to cave in to you?"

920409,jimmer,2015-06-17 14:57:00,2730,There are some real wackos out there. The comments in support of the ban are quite funny. They really are stupid and I don't use that word lightly.
