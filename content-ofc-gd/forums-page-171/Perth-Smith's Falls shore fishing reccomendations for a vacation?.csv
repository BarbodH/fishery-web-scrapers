We don't have a boat, but would like to take our 3 kids to a few spots for some shore fishing.  Any reccomendations on any spots we can try or any places we can stay that has lake or river access? We don't want to do any camping. Thanks for your help!"

You can fish off their dock and catch perch by the dozens its right on Lake Mississippi.It was about 4 years ago but, I believe we had a groupon so it was a good deal too..."

There is also Rideau Ferry just south of Smiths Falls.   A good place for lunch and fishing from their shoreline. www.therideauferryinn.com  Also on google maps   look to the north west of Perth.  Dalhousie Lake,  There is a river that enters there at the west end.  Good fishing and a great beach. Centennial Beach. www.sylvanialodge.com  Have fun,   I have spent a great deal of time driving those back roads.   You never know what you are going to come across.  Like the little town of Lanark.  Regards"
920698,irishfield,2015-06-19 15:13:00,26272,"You mean here Freshtrax.... this Bascule bridge is above Smiths Falls Detached Lock 31. It's the most upstream lock within the town of Smiths Falls and you can fish from this side the best as boats can't tie up here. Entrance to the park is between the swing bridge and the bridge over the rapids. You can also probably go for a little adventure and walk the track bed to above the dam and shore fishing there if not too overgrown.  sonic.. not sure the age of your children, so be aware that there is a lot of fast water through the SFalls lock system. Amazing that myself and the neighbourhood kids never drowned growing up left ""loose on the river"" or killed playing inside the new hydraulic controlled combined lock when it was being built when we were kids.  The big issue with shore fishing is the Rideau is a weed infested mess at the best of times, but it's no where near as bad as it was through the 60's and 70's.    "
