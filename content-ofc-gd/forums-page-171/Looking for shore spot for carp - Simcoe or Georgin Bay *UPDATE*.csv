919691,kenzy31,2015-06-12 15:58:00,261,Hello all I'm looking for direction on where I could take my wife and 2 girls shore fishing for carp? We've never targeted carp before so it will be a learning day as well as a fun day for the girls. I have no idea where to start but was thinking the park in Wasaga near the mouth may give us a chance at carp or even a kitty-fish! We live in Barrie so Simcoe to Georgian Bay is where we're looking. Any direction is greatly appreciated  Thanks gang! Jesse

Our travels took us up Hwy 11 to Washago and we ended up at the town park. Perfect for the kids and we were content to just let them roam for awhile in their rain gear, playing in the slop! We were next to the public launch with a great dock so we hung out there for awhile and got into a couple perch and a rock bass! The carp thing didn't work out but the kids had fun and it was a good day in the rain!! Trying to attach pics from my cell, but not working. I'll try again later  Jesse      "

A while back my daughter said she couldn't go outside because it was raining.  I said, don't worry, you won't melt.   Well that attitude has taken off and she uses that line on me now.   LOL"
