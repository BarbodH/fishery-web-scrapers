919978,Dontcryformejanhrdina,2015-06-14 17:49:00,535,"Gallie, I was in haliburton Monday and Wednesday, it was slow then too. In about 11 hours fishing combined (both mornings) I only went 2 for 2. No follows except one my fianc√©e had (who was skunked both days). She might of had a hit each day too but isn't sure. Still trying to get her to hook set harder. Managed a 32 and a 37 but it was tough going. Can't complain though, I've been skunked enough times to enjoy any day I land a musky."
919989,Rizzo,2015-06-14 18:21:00,4754,Yup stayed at petition dragon...I still smell of mothballs
919400,Rizzo,2015-06-10 17:36:00,4754,"The plan had been to do a multi species trip in kawarthas for a couple days...but saner heads have prevailed and we will be heading to St. Clair instead for 2 days of musky! We did the same last year, but didn't fare too well (hence the thought to go to kawarthas this time). Caught a few muskies last time, and one topped out at 49.5"" (caught casting a strawberry sledge), but it was pretty slow (compared to how we usually do in summmer). If it hadn't been for the good one, I would have called the trip a failure.  Haven't seen any St Clair musky opener reports but would be happy to hear them here (or via pm if you prefer)."
919403,lew,2015-06-10 17:41:00,12766,"(caught casting a strawberry sledge),  One of the best jerkbaits you'll find for a musky Roger and one of my favorites. I just sold a couple of them but still have a couple in reserve.  Best of luck this weekend and hopefully you get one of those big St. Clair slimy critters."
919405,Joey,2015-06-10 18:07:00,9122,"Good luck Roger, hope you get a monster!!!"
919412,kickingfrog,2015-06-10 18:32:00,8333,Maybe I should have haggled a little with you and I could have got one of those sledges thrown in on the deal for the boat.  Good luck Roger.
919417,Rizzo,2015-06-10 19:05:00,4754,haha...sledge is off the table
919433,kickingfrog,2015-06-10 20:56:00,8333,"Ya, and about those musky spots you threw in for free...   "

I'm planning on hitting LSC with a buddy tomorrow for my first musky outing of the year.  Hope to see you there. Where are you launching?"
919437,manitoubass2,2015-06-10 21:06:00,11391,"You mean one more restless night before opener?  Thats how I get, fish on the brain I spose. Barely get any sleep before openers"
919447,Rizzo,2015-06-10 22:00:00,4754,we are launching out of belle river...you guys?
919448,Rizzo,2015-06-10 22:00:00,4754,...may see you on the road too...leaving from guelph
919451,cram,2015-06-10 22:09:00,1733,49.5 sounds pretty good to me!
919458,Rizzo,2015-06-10 22:37:00,4754,oh i was plenty happy...about that one. But I think for 2.5 days fishing I only got 3 (other 2 were less than 40) and my buddy only got a pike and a sheephead....real miserable trip for him!
919471,cram,2015-06-10 23:12:00,1733,How'd the sheephead taste?
919473,Gallie,2015-06-10 23:13:00,1215,Better than its tail lol
919490,KraTToR,2015-06-11 00:55:00,506,...may see you on the road too...leaving from guelph Belle River as well.  Weather forecast is positive. Leaving Kitchener about 6am. You?
919509,Rizzo,2015-06-11 08:05:00,4754,"leaving around 4:45..because I can't sleep. Red van, black alumacraft"
919510,lew,2015-06-11 08:30:00,12766,Go get'em Roger
919513,shimano19,2015-06-11 10:55:00,196,How far you do you guys go from belle river
919567,mike rousseau,2015-06-11 16:52:00,4661,Just keep in mind a lot of people would say thats successful...  I know there are members here that would fish multiple days for one fish that size...
919568,Gallie,2015-06-11 16:59:00,1215,"Count me in that group! I havent got a musky over 40"" in the boat in over 6 years!!! Im heading to haliburton with the wife and baby this weekend and i hope to sneak out for a couple hours. At which point i would take a 30"" and be happy?"
919899,Rizzo,2015-06-14 00:45:00,4754,"Well we did pretty good numbers wise...between 2 of us caught and released 13 muskies in 2.5 days of fishing. Size? not so much. Our biggest was around 40, a whole bunch of mid 30's and a couple that you would need to put on the rack to stretch out to 25! Either way, lots of fun and got to bump into Krattor out there by the hump."
919907,Gallie,2015-06-14 01:55:00,1215,Nice work dude! I just got off the water myself and went 0/0 in 2 sessions in haliburton. Only fished a total of about 5 hours at morning and night.
919948,Joey,2015-06-14 14:55:00,9122,Good to hear you had a good time and some good numbers Rog.  Couple more years and they'll be bigger
919955,Steve,2015-06-14 16:12:00,2075,"Gotta love St Clair! Only lake in Ontario where you can get a 49.5"" muskie one year, than get 13 muskies in 2.5 days of fishing the next year.  May not ever produce the Ontario record, but certainly no other Muskie factory in Ontario like St Clair!!!  Didja stay at Le Petit Dragon?"
919970,misfish,2015-06-14 17:20:00,29133,Sounds like a good couple of days Roger.
