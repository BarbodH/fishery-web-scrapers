And when I suffer my family suffers.  When I smoke weed im relieved and functional. I feel good but not stoned. Just functional and without panic attacks/anxiety.  Im a new smoker, 35 now and i just started a few months back. I dont smoke to get high. A gram lasts me about a week. I juat one hit a tiny piece once or twice a day when I feel overwhelming panic.  I have PTSD so its a real struggle but things are getting beťter and marijuana helps.  No real side effects ive seen unless I use sativas I get high and anxiety worsens. Indicas help dramatically.  Personally, id rather smoke weed then use benzos, alcohol and or antidepressive drugs for my situation(all of which help initially then make things dramatically worse after)  THAT took a lot of guts.  I can only imagine what kind of event you experienced..  Regardless..  Indica, sativa... the chronic..  I'm a recreational user (only while I'm fishing nowadays) and I can tell you that there's a time and a place for everything.  Unfortunately, I've learned that the hard way while I was growing up..  I've never been in an accident, never hurt anyone and I've never been in trouble with the law.  But I can tell you that my path to a rewarding career was severely affected.  I coasted through college, couldn't hold a job.. couldn't hold a gf..  Why?  Because I couldn't function like a regular person.  Now that I'm older and I have a wife and son, I've had to change my habits.  That meant no weed on weekdays.  My current role dictates that I have to be sharp..  ie.  think clearly, process thoughts quicker, keep my emotions in check.. etc.  I just wouldn't be able to do this if I smoked weed every day.  The weed we get nowadays is so potent and the effects don't go away within a day or two.  They always linger.  Your sleep, your diet, your mood is affected!  You're just not functionning at your full potential.  Mind you, that's just another side of things..  If I knew then what I know now..  I would have passed up that spliff years back."
920516,GbayGiant,2015-06-17 23:53:00,1780,"In a statement on June 11, Canadian health minister Rona Ambrose reacted strongly to the Supreme Court ruling that medical cannabis should be available in all forms to patients using it for medical purposes. Not only is Ambrose “outraged”, she believes that it sends a message of normalization to Canadian youth and that there is no clear evidence on the efficacy of cannabis for medical purposes. But she’s wrong. It’s troubling that the health minister of Canada, a voice that is suppose to serve the public health interest of Canadians, still cannot admit that cannabis can be, and is, used for a variety of medical purposes. We should also be concerned that our health minister is having trouble with a decision made in the highest court of Canada. In a unanimous decision (7-0) effective immediately, the judges agreed that it was unreasonable to require users to smoke dried marijuana and that Canadians should not have to choose between their liberty and their health. Does that mean our constitutional rights simply don’t matter to Ambrose? Let’s not forget that the Harper government appointed seven of the nine judges of the Supreme Court of Canada. It’s frightening that our health minister not only lacks understanding of Canadian’s constitutional rights, but that she outright refuses to become better educated about cannabis as a medicine. Instead, she’d rather sit with her eyes and ears closed reaffirming that “cannabis is not a medicine”! If that were me in Ambrose’s position, I’d want to see the research too. Part of the job description entails the promotion and protection of public health. Unfortunately, her opinion is not based on current evidence, but century-old “reefer madness” propaganda that is really out of touch with current science. In fact, there are many credible institutions in North America producing peer-reviewed studies on cannabis—from the science to the sociology—and even more when we look to international leaders in this type of research, such as Israel and Spain. Even many of the current producers licensed under the federal program have made a trip to Israel to see what types of innovations are happening there in the medical cannabis world. Kirk Tousaw, the lawyer responsible for winning this case, said in a recent CBC News interview that Ambrose should “go back to her desk, and get to work on crafting a reasonable set of regulations that will stand up to charter scrutiny, that’s her job”. And he’s right. In Canada, it seems the judicial system is the only real way to make meaningful change—the entire medical cannabis program was a right won in the courts. We can’t forget about the children, says Ambrose, arguing that medical access in other forms will make pot seem “normal” to them. What about seven-year-old Liam McKnight with Dravet syndrome, whose mother has been breaking the law for nearly two years to provide cannabis in oil form to her son to manage his seizures? Or three-year-old Gwenevere Repetski who relies on the oil to manage her epilepsy? Does the health minister of Canada believe these children should smoke their medicine, or that their parents should be criminalized for extracting cannabis into oil form? To deny the experience of many Canadians without any proper education certainly seems to have become commonplace for the Harper government. But then again, it’s not like the Harper government has done a great job preserving our constitutional rights lately. With this ruling, it will be interesting to see the long-term impact on the federal medical marijuana program. A large, unanswered question revolves around whether or not this decision leaves room for commercial production of extracts for licensed producers in Canada. As many have suggested, the real future in the medical cannabis world lies in the availability of extracts and derivatives, particularly for many patients who are unable, for various reasons, to convert the dried forms on their own. What I do know is that the landscape is changing fast, and Ambrose better get with the program, or get out."

That's what corn should weigh for a farmer to get paid for grade 2 corn. If your bushel weight is less than 56 lbs, you will likely receive a discounted price. Bushel weight is impacted every year by many factors, factors like planting date, fertility levels, heat units received and plant maturity. Some years the corn weighs heavy, some years light."
920232,John Bacon,2015-06-16 13:04:00,3277,"There has never been a known case of anyone overdosing and dying from cannabis.  That does not mean that it does not cause harm when smoked on a regular basis over a long time period.  I have never heard of anyone dying because the smoked too many cigarettes at once.  However, there are pleny people who have died from the long term effects of smoking a pack a day.  Do you consider water to be hazardess to your health?  There are known cases of people overdosing and dying from water.  Drinking several litres of water in a short time period can be fatal because your body cannot deal with that much water in a short time frame.  However, drinking reasonable quantities everyday is not only harmless, but necessary for survival.  I don't think that measuring the amount of a substance required to cause a fatal overdose is particularily relevant to indicate the health effects of long term consumption.  Having said that, I still support legalization.  Adults can make their own choices; even when those are not good for them.  But, lets not pretend that it is harmless."

Rats developed tumors after drinking water containing glysophate. Who ever promoted drinking glysophate? We don't drink water laced with gasoline or anti-freeze of household cleaners, do we? (Yet some of our rivers by big cities have so many hormones or hormone like substances in the waste water from birth control pills and various everyday household products that the that fish are changing sex.) He implies that RR crops cause obesity, autism, various cancers and behavioural changes. Because he says so this must be true. After all, it's on the internet. Many cancers take years to develop, yet he implies that cancer rates increase at virtually the same rate as the use of RR crops. I thought obesity was caused by the vast amount of processed junk food consumed while sitting on the couch watching TV for hours on end. Weren't vaccines supposed to cause autism? Isn't this why some misguided parents are putting other families at risk by not vaccinating their children because some kook celebrity says so? I'm pretty sure that if your sitting on your couch tonight smoking a joint and eating a bag of Doritos that it's not the corn in the Doritos affecting your behaviour. And farmers have been using insecticides and fungicides on seed for decades. And these same crops are routinely sprayed with various herbicides and pesticides. This is nothing new. And many chemicals that were commonplace are no longer available or used in the same way because they were proven carcinogenic or weeds became resistant. Will glysophate share this fate? Time will tell. I will agree that neonics seem to be a concern and need to be closely looked at. Glysophate resistant weeds are not superweeds. They are simply weeds that are or have become resistant to glysophate. This is not unique to glysophate. This is why most farmers have a cropping program that makes use of crop rotation and the use of different classes of herbicides to employ various modes of action, thereby trying to avoid weed resistance to any certain family of herbicides. It's interesting that in the 90's, corn was genetically modified to be resistant to corn borer. It's called bt corn and most of the corn grown is now bt corn.

920268,Dutch01,2015-06-16 16:53:00,1431,"Now THAT is a response, now we're talking.   ""My take away is that I would take most of what he says with a large grain of salt when he is either purposefully misleading you or grossly inaccurate when it come to a few basic facts.""  I take what everyone says with a grain of salt.  Monsanto has spent 10's or even 100's of millions of dollars silencing any criticism of their products. They have infiltrated corporate boards and forced researchers to retract unflattering studies. They have used the courts to bully farmers into bankruptcy for the ""crime"" of having their non-GMO crops pollinated by neighbours growing Monsanto crops. I believe that Monsanto is aware of health risks associated with Glyphosate, and will do anything to silence critics. So forgive me if I put this lecturer a little above Monsanto on the trustworthiness scale.  ""Rats developed tumors after drinking water containing glysophate. Who ever promoted drinking glysophate? We don't drink water laced with gasoline or anti-freeze of household cleaners, do we? (Yet some of our rivers by big cities have so many hormones or hormone like substances in the waste water from birth control pills and various everyday household products that the that fish are changing sex.)""  We already spray glyphosate on food crops multiple times over a growth cycle. These food crops are mostly water. Having rats drink water with glyphosate is intended to stimulate long term accumulation of smaller doses, and is a common and valid research methodology.  As an interesting aside, when researchers blocked the endocannabinoid system in rats, the rats developed VERY large tumors, leading researches to conclude that marijuana may have therapeutic value in the treatment of tumors.  ""He implies that RR crops cause obesity, autism, various cancers and behavioural changes. Because he says so this must be true. After all, it's on the internet.""   And because Monsanto says the opposite, it must be true right?   ""Many cancers take years to develop, yet he implies that cancer rates increase at virtually the same rate as the use of RR crops.

Yes, many cancers take years to develop. Roundup hit the market in 1970, that's almost 50 years for cancers to develop.  I don't eat Doritos, FYI.  You are correct that marijuana affects my behavior. In my case I would argue for the better.  At least I have the choice to partake or not. Monsanto has spent millions of dollars to prevent labeling that would allow me the choice to consume Roundup or not.   ""And farmers have been using insecticides and fungicides on seed for decades.

If companies like Monsanto have their way, no one will be talking about anything. We will all be silenced. We will all be in the dark. We will not have choices.  As a species, we have proven to be remarkably short sighted. If we allow the wholesale commercialization of our food supply based on profit, rather than science and ethics, we risk destroying the biodiversity that makes the Earth function.  Monsanto's market capitalization is at +/-$55B and growing. Their only organizational goal is profit. If we don't take a stand now, we are lost. To be fair, I am not just singling out Monsanto.  There are many large multinational corporations who are buying favourable public policy all over the world.  I don't believe it is an overstatement to say we are allowing these corporations to dictate our future (or lack thereof).  I'm not much of an optimist, and I personally believe it is already too late. If true, then all my words amount to nothing more than raging against the machine.  I really hope you will look beyond the surface arguments here and think about what motivates these actors. Only then can you understand what their end game is.  Dutch  Sent from my iPhone"

He engineered an existing entomopathogenic fungus (fungi that destroys insects) to not produce spores. Insects eat the fungus, and are then turned into fungus from the inside out.  I'm not suggesting we run headlong into a new era without significant research, but at first glance this appears to be a better alternative than soaking our fields with an industrial descaling agent (the original patented use for glyphosate)."

By all means hold them accountable. Same goes for government.  (Wynne getting re-elected still infuriates me.) But I'm do realize that everyone has an agenda, and a speaker at an organic growers conference also has an agenda. He goes on about glysophate being a descaler. So what? Toothpaste takes grease stains out of my clothes, but I still brush my teeth with it. Coke will dissolve the rust off of metal too, but I still like it with rum. (Never mind the major impact soft drinks have re; obesity rates.) Some guys put WD-40 on their fishing lures, which I really don't understand. The main active ingredient of Viagra was initially used for other purposes than what it is sold for now, but that doesn't seem to be a bone of contention. The list can go on and on. (see your doctor after 4 hrs.)  Roundup may have available since the 70's, but it wasn't until the mid 90's that it began being sprayed directly on field crops. It's primary use initially was use as a burndown, to clean up weeds before or after the crop was planted or harvested, usually for hard to kill perennials like quackgrass.  And in the vast majority of cases, this involves one application per season, not multiple applications.  The media shares some blame in sensationalizing these issues. There was a news article about the horrors of  a crop of wheat that wouldn't die because it was Roundup resistant. Roundup ready volunteer corn and wheat that appears in a subsequent years crop of soybeans, for example, is actually quite easy to control with other classes of herbicides that are routinely being used. And all weeds and plants are still allergic to iron in the form of a cultivator or plow.  As far as choice goes, I'll give you that one. Food labelling has come a long way, and probably has a long way to go. What makes me shake my head is that some people will lose their minds over what farmers are using in their fields in Canada, all which have gone through a regulatory process to be registered, and yet they will by fruit and vegetables from Asia, China, Central and South America, and many other places in the world where you have absolutely no idea what is being used to grow those foodstuffs. You remember that video of the fish being raised in the river in what was essentially human waste? Canadians are eating that every day without question.  US farmers have access to chemicals that aren't registered for use in Canada. Some of these chemicals may be good or bad, but we will likely never know because the cost of getting these chemicals approved for use here in Canada is too high, and our market is too small to bother with. So you have likely eaten grain products grown with chemicals that have never been approved for use in Canada.  Anyway, I have quite enjoyed this thread, but I'm bowing out. All the best to you Dutch01. I enjoyed your posts, even though our opinions are quite different.

919871,GbayGiant,2015-06-13 20:30:00,1780,"On Thursday, the Supreme Court of Canada struck down an appeal by the federal government to maintain the nonsensical status quo with regards to medical marijuana. The rules had stipulated that medical marijuana could only be possessed and consumed in its dried form, which meant chronically ill users were essentially restricted to smoking it. This made no sense whatsoever; a terminal lung cancer patient with a license to use medical marijuana, for example, should not be limited to lighting up. Yet under Sections 4 and 5 of the Controlled Drug and Substances Act, the creation and consumption of medical marijuana in alternate forms — in tablets, ointments, in baked goods or extracts — was prohibited. In a unanimous decision, the Supreme Court called out the restriction for what it was: “arbitrary.” The Court ruled that the denial of legal alternative forms of consumption violated the guarantee of life, liberty and security of the person under Section 7 of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms by forcing ill users to choose between “a legal but inadequate treatment and an illegal but more effective choice.” Limiting people to smoking medical marijuana, the Court added, “subjects the person to the risk of cancer and bronchial infections associated with smoking dry marihuana.” This is just basic common sense: permitting the use of a substance but stipulating the specific way it must be used, especially when that method is arguably more physically harmful than all other ways, is simply asinine policy. Indeed, the government has not, and did not, offer a sound explanation as to why those who are licensed to possess and use medical marijuana should be forced to smoke it, rather than consume it in teas, baked goods, pills or extracts. So the Supreme Court ruled against it, and rightly so. This case dates back to 2009, when Owen Smith, a baker for the Cannabis Buyers Club of Canada, was arrested and charged after police found marijuana-infused cookies and oils in his Victoria apartment. Smith challenged the law and was acquitted at trial, and the decision was held up last summer at the B.C. Court of Appeal. The Court gave the federal government a year to change the law; it instead challenged the decision at the Supreme Court, which ended up supporting the trial judge’s conclusion. The decision should have a profound impact on the lives of Canadians suffering with chronic pain or disease, including the families of children with severe epileptic disorders. Last year, Postmedia reported on the story of six-year-old Liam McKnight, who suffered with epilepsy so severe he was experiencing dozens of seizures per day. Though Liam and his family had tried dozens of medications, none of them seemed to help. Then Liam’s mom gave him cannabis oil, and he was seizure-free after 10 days. Unfortunately, because of the rules on marijuana consumption, Health Canada effectively said the kindergartener, if continuing to legally take marijuana, would have to smoke it. That shouldn’t have to happen anymore. Indeed, the Supreme Court’s decision is a win for families like Liam’s, and a win for common sense. Ill Canadians should not be told they can use marijuana and at the same time arbitrarily restricted as to the method of consumption. We’re glad the Supreme Court recognized that, even if the federal government did not. National Post"
919901,fish_fishburn,2015-06-14 00:51:00,1311,There has never been a known case of anyone overdosing and dying from cannabis. A study I read recently said in order to overdose you would have to smoke 1500 joints in an hour. Now if you ate to many brownies at a sitting you may feel like your gonna puke but you will be fine in an hour or two. The govt reason for this smoke only policy was nothing more than them protecting their bedfellow big pharma. Big pharma knows that consuming weed oil will cure many diseases and ailments because the CBO and CBD in the carboxolized oil are a cure for many diseases and we cant have that. I have a friend who had type II diabetes he was taking two or 3 needles a day to keep his insulin in check. He bought a pound of good weed and had someone make oil out of it. He took it twice a day and in three weeks he was no longer doing needles and his blood/sugar levels were normal. He takes it now once a week for maintenance and everything is good. He said when he mentioned it to his doc he didn't seem to surprised or interested in his finding.  So sometimes when things seem so ridiculous and asinine with govt policy if you follow the money you will probably find your answer.

919924,GbayGiant,2015-06-14 12:46:00,1780,"The question I’m answering today is ‘how much marijuana does it take for someone to overdose?’ My friend is well aware that no one in recorded history has ever died from a marijuana overdose. But he wants to know if there is any amount of marijuana that someone could overdose from. According to a 1988 United States administrative law hearing: “7. Drugs used in medicine are routinely given what is called an LD-50. The LD-50 rating indicates at what dosage fifty percent of test animals receiving a drug will die as a result of drug induced toxicity. A number of researchers have attempted to determine marijuana’s LD-50 rating in test animals, without success. Simply stated, researchers have been unable to give animals enough marijuana to induce death. 8. At present it is estimated that marijuana’s LD-50 is around 1:20,000 or 1:40,000. In layman terms this means that in order to induce death a marijuana smoker would have to consume 20,000 to 40,000 times as much marijuana as is contained in one marijuana cigarette. NIDA-supplied marijuana cigarettes weigh approximately .9 grams. A smoker would theoretically have to consume nearly 1,500 pounds of marijuana within about fifteen minutes to induce a lethal response.  9. In practical terms, marijuana cannot induce a lethal response as a result of drug-related toxicity.” Even if someone is smoking marijuana concentrates or ‘dabs’ which can be 3-4 times more potent than their flower counterparts, that’s still hundreds of pounds of marijuana dabs within a 15 minute period. A person would pass out before they experienced a lethal dose level of marijuana. Something could harm the person if they fell while passing out resulting in death, but that’s different than the marijuana itself causing death. Some readers are probably wondering why the federal government fights so hard against marijuana research. Maybe it’s because every time they research marijuana they find out how wrong they are…"

920043,Dutch01,2015-06-14 23:39:00,1431," I could talk about LD-50 dose and many other measures of a compound's toxicity, but frankly this is not an issue of whether marijuana is healthy. It is an issue of rights.  If being unhealthy was the primary consideration for legalizing any product, our lives would look very different. No more car exhaust, alcohol, sugar, cigarettes, cheeseburgers, etc for anyone. And don't get me started on food safety. The government allows wholesale use of Glyphosate (aka Roundup, a known carcinogen) in our crops. They can't do that and then claim marijuana is unsafe.  The bottom line issue is that I don't recognize the government's right to restrict my freedom unless they can show the exercise of that freedom infringes on someone else's rights. My use of marijuana is my business and no one else's.   It is not that the Dutch are ""Pro drugs"". Quite the opposite in fact. Many Dutch people are actually quite conservative regarding drugs.  However, they tend to believe it is better sold by regulated shops than in a dark alley. Of note, despite their liberal drug policy, they have a lower per capita rate of drug use than we do (another example of the ineffectiveness of prohibition).  I leave you with this food for thought. According to Jeffrey Miron, a senior lecturer at Harvard University, the USA spent more money last year on marijuana prohibition (over $20B) than on the entire budget for NASA. Can anyone seriously tell me with a straight face that this is money well spent? That it's more important to stop me from having a joint after work than to work towards scientific discovery for mankind's future? If so, I would say you need to check your priorities."
920051,GbayGiant,2015-06-15 00:34:00,1780,"""Good grief. What on earth has federal Health Minister Rona Ambrose been nibbling? Steroid-laced Alberta cheeseburgers? She certainly hasn’t been chowing down on soothing cannabis cookies. Her dyspeptic reaction to the Supreme Court’s ruling this past week legalizing reefer brownies and Mary Jane tisanes raised more eyebrows than a whiff of skunk at a church picnic. It came across like a spasm of ‘roid rage. Or a bit of self-serving Conservative political posturing in the run-up to a federal election. “Frankly, I’m outraged,” Ambrose declared. “I’m outraged by the message that judges are sending that they think that they can approve a drug into a medicine without clear clinical scientific evidence and without safety reviews.” Cannabis “is not a drug … not a medicine,” she insisted. Well, not on Prime Minister Stephen Harper’s Reefer Madness-obsessed watch. Health Canada could make it an approved medicine, but won’t. The Tories are ideologically dead set against anyone using marijuana. While two in three Canadians want it legalized or decriminalized, the Tories are forever bashing Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau for proposing to legalize. And they can’t bring themselves to decriminalize, as New Democrat Leader Tom Mulcair proposes. But for all Ambrose’s sputtering, the Supremes weren’t trying to practice medicine without a licence by declaring marijuana a cure for what ails us. They were just upholding the law of the land. Medical use of marijuana for seriously ill people, while controversial, has been legal in Canada since 2001 after the courts ruled that cannabis has some “medicinal value” and can be of “therapeutic assistance.” It is commonly used to offer relief to those who suffer from cancer, HIV/AIDS, multiple sclerosis, migraine, epilepsy, spinal cord injuries and other conditions. Ambrose’s own department, Health Canada, has licensed no fewer than 25 firms to grow the stuff. Some 50,000 Canadians use it, lawfully. And yes, Ottawa can claim its tax cut. But until now Health Canada rules effectively forced people to smoke medical marijuana. And that violated the Constitution by unreasonably interfering with “life, liberty and security of the person” in two ways, the court ruled: People who wanted to consume marijuana in, say, a cookie would face prison while a smoker would not. That’s patently unfair. And forcing people to smoke exposes them to cancer and bronchial infections. That’s just dumb. Rightly, the court found these rules both arbitrary and unhealthy. So brownies, cookies, teas and whatever other concoction ailing people can whip up in the kitchen blender are now on the menu. As they should be. Despite Ambrose’s wild assertion that the high court justices are branching out into the drug-approval business, this ruling gives the judicial nod to baking brownies for sick people, nothing more. The federal government, under Liberals and Tories alike, has long since given the nod to medicinal toking. This minister needs to chill out.""  Toronto Star"

France has announced a ban on over the counter sales of a brand of weedkiller from garden centres after the active ingredient was classified as ""probably carcinogenic to humans"" by the UN.  The UN’s International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) classified glyphosate in March as ""probably carcinogenic to humans"", and is the active ingredient in Roundup.  The weedkiller is used by amateur gardeners as well as farmers and is the foremost product of American biotechnology giant Mosanto.  French Ecology Minister Segolene Royal told France 3 television on Sunday: ""France must be on the offensive with regards to the banning of pesticides.""       ""I have asked garden centres to stop putting Monsanto's Roundup on sale"" in self-service aisles, she added.  Glyphosate was introduced in the 1970s under the brand Roundup and is the most-produced weedkiller in the world, according to the IARC.  The agency's evaluation of glyphosate saw ""limited evidence"" of a type of cancer called non-Hodgkin lymphoma, as seen in studies in the United States, Sweden and Canada conducted among farm workers since 2001.  Monsanto strongly contested the IARC classification, commenting that ""relevant, scientific data was excluded from review.""  Monsanto said in a statement: ""As consumers ourselves, safety is a priority for every person who works at Monsanto.  ""We want to be clear: All labeled uses of glyphosate are safe for human health and supported by one of the most extensive worldwide human health databases ever compiled on an agricultural product.

919776,Dutch01,2015-06-12 23:05:00,1431,"Marijuana prohibition (and by extension all prohibitionist policy) comes down to one simple issue. Freedom. It is no one's business if I smoke a little at home after a hard day's work. Just as it's not my business to tell anyone else how to live. We have a sovereign and inalienable right to freedom, and that right must not be infringed unless it can be shown that the exercise of that right infringes on someone else's freedom. End of discussion. For me personally, this is about weed. For others, it's about sexuality. For others still, it is about their right to practice their religion.  I have voted Conservative all my life, sometimes while holding my nose. I can't do it anymore. Not when this government believes that it knows best how I should live my life.  Further, this government is demonstrably corrupt on this issue. The only people who have been approved to grow medical marijuana are politically connected insiders.  There are a number of traditional arguments put forward by the prohibitionists:  * Marijuana kills brain cells  FALSE. This contention is based on a study done with monkeys in the 60's. A study paid for by people who wanted MJ illegal. The researchers fought for decades to keep their data from peer review. They eventually lost, and once reviewed, the study's conclusions were debunked. The monkeys were fed MJ smoke through gas masks, without supplemental oxygen, until they suffocated to death. Of course they were going to have dead brain cells upon autopsy, they were suffocated to death!  * Marijuana causes cancer  FALSE.  The largest and longest study of its kind was done by Dr. Donald Tashkin, professor of medicine at UCLA. after studying thousands of users for 20 years, he concluded that MJ did not cause cancer. In fact, there was a very slight reduction in the rate of cancer versus the control group.  * Marijuana is addictive  FALSE.  There are two components to addiction, physical withdrawal and habit strength. MJ does not cause physical withdrawal.  Also, note the hypocrisy; if we ban things for being addictive, why do we allow the sale of alcohol, cigarettes, caffeine and sugar?  I will acknowledge one potentially harmful aspect of MJ use, and that is that when used regularly by young people, it can lead to an early onset of schizophrenia. It is important to be very clear here though.  Schizophrenia is largely hereditary and physiological in nature.  MJ cannot cause schizophrenia. It can only advance the onset in people who were going to get it anyways. And no one that I know is advocating its use by minors. Which leads to the next fallacy....  * Legalization will make it more accessible to kids.  FALSE. MJ is already in wide use by teens in Canada. Prohibition has failed to stop this. The best place to get it is probably a high school, and many teens say it is easier to get than alcohol. The notion that controlling it like beer or cigarettes will make it easier for kids to get is simply untrue.  * Marijuana supports criminal gangs.  TRUE. But ONLY by virtue of being illegal. MJ is not very difficult to grow if you know what you are doing.  It should be no more valuable than tomatoes, but because we spend billions to constrain the supply, we artificially inflate its value.  Making it legal and cheap (by not taxing it so hard that it retains its prohibition era value) makes it an unattractive commodity for organized crime.  Stephen Harper, by way of his willingness to put his personal and/or religious dogma ahead of science, had lost the moral authority on this issue. I for one will not be able to hold my nose and vote for him again.  /rant"

919807,DRIFTER_016,2015-06-13 03:06:00,10439,They must be running out of things to tax here? Pot gives them a new cash cow.  Well if that were true they would legalize it and make a fortune on the taxes off it.

But if it's legal? send a check? Then there is also the state competition? They are getting free money? We want a piece of the pie too!  Once Ohio saw neighboring states hitting the casino tax jackpot? That sin disappeared!"

Now, I don't smoke it myself but most of my friends in Alaska did before it was legal to do so. But I have no issues partaking of their cheap rum!!!"
919824,fishing n autograph,2015-06-13 13:21:00,2540,Actually recent studies have shown that marihuana damages short and long term memory and significantly effects developing brains of young adults. Pot is not harmless. Especially today's hydroponically grown marihuana which is genetically modified to produce a THC content of close to and over 24%.
919827,glen,2015-06-13 13:44:00,2641,Pot vs pills as a treatment.
919838,Old Ironmaker,2015-06-13 14:30:00,8243,"Is  pot  harmful or addictive? What I do know is that I've been around and experienced the swingin 60's in High School. Several potheads from then are alive today and don't know what year it is. I have a cousin in the States that chain smokes the Stupid Stick for the last 45 years. He couldn't hold down a job for more than a month and has been on Welfare for the past 25 years. A few out here on the lake are exactly the same, all on disability and their life is growing and smoking then repeat. I can say only one has a violent nature, and that's when he doesn't have any. I don't have any documentation to copy and paste only my observations from  seeing it for the past 45 years or so. Like anything in excess is not good, but in my experience to say it is not addictive or not harmful to at least some is Bull."
919840,kickingfrog,2015-06-13 14:49:00,8333,"Good thing alcohol and nicotine are not addictive, or harmful.  It's Saturday morning. How many DUI's were there last night?  I've never tried marihuana (I've never even tried a cigaret) and I'm not sure about the addictiveness, or effectiveness of pot but to rule it out as an option for people with health issues is more then narrow minded.  Good thing our government is big on science and research.  They'd never be tied to big pharma and want to protect their interests.  Many western European countries have more relaxed laws for pot, maybe we should look at how that has, or has not, worked for them?  Some of those sentences are sarcastic and I can't help you if you can't figure out which are, and which aren't."
919849,Lunkerhunter,2015-06-13 16:13:00,455,"Alcohol, tobacco and prescription pills have zero impact on the above mentioned side effects either right? Short and/or long term memory loss is a walk in the park compared to the negative effects of prescription pills, alcohol and tobacco. Come On now let's be real about this"
919609,fish_fishburn,2015-06-11 21:59:00,1311,"Rona Ambrose says she is outraged by the Supreme Courts ruling that medical marijuana users can take their medicine any way they want to. Either smoke it, consume it in edibles or make oil or tincture from it. The old law was to smoke it only and if taken any other way and get caught by the cops you could be arrested.  Harper and his henchman appealed this ruling three times in the Supreme  Court of B.C. before it went to the Supreme Court of Canada for final ruling.and he lost. No kidding. It only cost the tax payers 10.5 million in legal fees to represent the feds.  I am outraged that Rona Ambrose is our Health Minister she is such a fool. Lets see how outraged she is next November when she tries to find a new job.  She does have nice hair though."
919611,Steve,2015-06-11 22:25:00,2075,Harper is a hitler when it comes to any form of legalization.  He'll be gone soon enough...thank goodness.
919613,Andy,2015-06-11 22:39:00,330,I fully agree with the federal governments reservations re; medical marijuana. Harper = Hitler is just a ridiculous and offensive statement. Just ask my father and mother who grew up in Holland during the war.
919614,SirWhite,2015-06-11 23:12:00,210,I guess that makes you a minority. Welcome to the future. No more carcinogens. How could a forward government openly condone smoking.... Anything? It's an obvious answer to an obvious mistake. (Issuing federal laws allowing SMOKING of Marijuana)
919617,Steve,2015-06-11 23:40:00,2075,"""is a"" as in, the way harper rules is a ""hitler way"".  not harper = hitler."

919625,wkrp,2015-06-12 00:08:00,656,Rona is in desperate need of a Reno.........
919632,pics,2015-06-12 01:28:00,1268,While I don't condone the pothead culture I believe it could be great medicine for many ailments. I have vertigo and I think it would help my symptoms but I'd rather it be in a controlled dose pill.. Big pharma isn't the answer either... The reform party type of thinking is taking over our current government...
919635,Gallie,2015-06-12 02:14:00,1215,"Im fairly certain there are medicines out there that have far worse side effects than pot, its the stigma alone that makes this such a gong show. Smoking pot has got to be the least effective and most unhealthy way to consume it for its medical benefits, im glad this ruling has put this to bed and i hope the people who need it most can make the best use of it now."
919638,Moosebunk,2015-06-12 02:36:00,3970,"It can be medicine, sure!  Curious if anyone knows how much of this medicine,(wondering percentages) is covered by OHIP?  Otherwise, who's paying for it?  Taxpayer or solely the patient?"
919640,Rod Caster,2015-06-12 02:40:00,5784,"Conservative government is supposed to be a free market/business government. Yet they highly regulate a market they have recently created. It's a market based solely in healthcare and they force sick people to smoke this product, including if you have lung cancer and use medical pot as treatment. It's so silly and political ... If you are going to legalize it for medical reasons, then base it on medical science, not your political base. Pure nonsense on their part, it's completely see-through.  Recreational users should have no say in this debate, it should be all about it's medicinal properties and the best/healthiest way to administer it to those that can benefit from it."
919642,Moosebunk,2015-06-12 02:42:00,3970,Conservatives have all but burned any science and banished Scientists... Of course it's all left to nonsense now. lol.

919657,Canuck2fan,2015-06-12 06:48:00,1444,Rona must be hoping to get a favorable write up from Maureen Dowd for when she is looking for work in the US after the election...  The evidence is very clear that using edibles instead of smoking gives a longer lasting benefit... It if it for medical relief of symptoms how could that be a bad thing? For an interesting look at the responsible sale of edibles check this out.  
919663,Steve,2015-06-12 11:08:00,2075,the effects from consumption vs smoking vs pills (thc) are all different.  every person reacts differently. which means each method works differently for each person.
919665,fish_fishburn,2015-06-12 11:22:00,1311,"Moosebunk, I don't think OHIP pays for any of it. Its in the hands of the patient. If they cant afford it, to bad."

919668,FLEX ROD,2015-06-12 12:07:00,394,"As a suffer from chronic pain for almost 21 YEARS, I think that this is a topic that I can shed so light on - FROM MY PERSONAL EXPERIENCE.  Gallie, you are half correct, the other drugs that come to play are all from the Opioid family, and you are correct the side effects can be brutal and one does not know how long the side effects last and also when they will show up as they like to sneak up from behind at times.  Pics, the medical controlled dose big pharma option does exist its called Nabilon and once again we don't know the long term issues and the drug basically keeps you at a level where you cant function properly.  Moosbunk, OHIP and most insurance plans do not cover it at all so the patient is on their own, so depending on how much they are prescribed as this varies from patient to patient, for me I have 1mg per day I am paying well over $300.00 per month.  As a user I now have the option to use it when I really need it, but with the Nabilon you have to use it as prescribed and it has to be in the system so again you are faced with unknown side effects down the road, at least when I am in control I can put it into a vaporiser and turn it into vapor so I don't even have to smoke it and within minutes I will get whatever relief I get.  FLEX"
919669,SirCranksalot,2015-06-12 12:51:00,3291, The evidence is very clear that using edibles .................  Evidence? Evidence? We don't need no steenking evidence. We've got political dogma! Tons and tons of it. Seeee!!

919685,fish_fishburn,2015-06-12 15:12:00,1311,FLEX ROD You say it costs you well over 300 per month and you use 1 milligram per day. If I am not mistaken a milligram is 100th of a gram. Maybe you mean a gram per day. No. Even at 300 per oz that is a lot of money. Are you purchasing from the govt grow ops?. This is why prohibition on weed is bad if it were legalized you medical users would be paying probably 50 an ounce.
919688,Lunkerhunter,2015-06-12 15:29:00,455,I fully support the use of medical marijiuana and have seen the direct positive impact it has on several people in my life. I think it is ridiculous that the Canadian government says you can smoke it but cant eat it. I am glad there is some movement in the right direction in our country regarding marijuana laws for med patients.

I've checked into it and it's normaly one or two mgs and it's not actually cannabis, it's a synthetic cannabinoid and it's super consentrated.  So in effect,  it's synthesized cannabis and it takes very little to produce the desired effect."
