918342,KLINKER,2015-06-03 13:20:00,256,"That question on a test catches a lot of them, you have to take into consideration the height of the bow eye from the water and in this case you loose some rope length in the knots so it would be less than 7'. Point being that 49' aint a lot of rope."
918343,BillM,2015-06-03 13:27:00,17367,Didn't even think of the bow eye      But when are you ever anchoring at a 7:1 ratio.  I know I never do.

Before my dock was built. During one storm I had to double anchor with 100' of line on each anchor in 6 or 8 feet of water in order to not drag and end up smashed on the rocks.

On one federal site for obtaining a boaters card there are statements made that just don't jive from what I have been taught. Like a light is required for operating a boat after dark but no mention of floating light or just waterproof, and if operating during daylight. It talks about needing a fire extinguisher for I/O motors or inboard gas tanks but doesn't say anything about a Marine approved (white) extinguisher. I am specifically trying to find out if the light the OPP are always checking to see if it works has to be water proof or can float. A light that can sink seems useless to me on the water. The site is boatsmartexam.com. It has some info but mostly general info. without much detail.

917143,Old Ironmaker,2015-05-27 02:21:00,8243,"I would venture a guess this discussion could go on for many pages.  I was just told Sunday by a former commercial fisherman that is MANDATORY for all boaters to have navigational maps on board your vessel for all waters in Canada that are charted which includes Ontario and so far Quebec. That is unless you can show that you are able to locate where you are visually. Don't quote me but a boat past a certain size must have maps on board unless more than 100 meters from shore. I have no idea how someone can identify visually where they are in a fog or where land can't be seen. It really makes me shake my head when I see guys going out 10 miles from shore here without a compass, or have a compass but didn't take a heading going out of port. Where we fish the Hydro stacks at Nanticoke can be seen from miles away. I've seen them from the I-90 on the US side. But in a fog you can't see the front of your own boat some days. What was this thread about again????  Let me ask a question. If you are in the OPP and you are chosen to work spring to the end of fall patrolling the pristine waters of Ontario that happens to be laden with Bikini clad women sunning on the decks of boats would you try your best to do a great job and have to get help to carry all the summons' into the Commanders office would you do a stellar job or not?

917179,Parnelly,2015-05-27 11:18:00,108,"Last year fishing Temagami we were stopped. MNR, and OPP in the same boat. First check was for licenses, my brother had forgot his in the tent but they said he was ok, I showed mine. Then it was for safety gear, opened the fishing deck to show lifejackets and anchor, next was the stowaway compartment, where we keep our safety supplies, high powered spot lamp, safety kit, spare prop among other things. Although I had checked the flashlight prior to leaving and had the big spot they still wanted to see the small one work. It didnt. MNR officer told me to shake the flashlight, it came on. Next was for fish. Now this is where I was kind of perturbed. After opening the livewell the OPP officer stepped into our boat. He wanted to make sure there was nothing in the live well. At this point there was only one compartment left in the boat we had not opened so they could see inside. Before leaving our boat the officer turns and opens that last compartment. He looks at me and says ""any fish in here""?. Now, I didnt like the fact he helped himself to view what was in that compartment. We had already shown them everything they asked for, but he seemed to be looking for something else. He looked in to see all our fishing supplies. While we kept the exchange friendly and had no issues with him looking there, (all he had to do was ask), I dont think he had the right to do that on his own. Everything went well and they were on their way.  Respect was given both ways and the exchange went quickly, and was fairly pleasant. Keep it simple, so its simple to keep."

Do you think for one minute that if an officer in the marine division didn't produce lots of tickets at the end of his shift that he would remain in that unit. Of course not he would be back on hwy patrol in no time flat.  The lowest fruit always gets picked first (fisherman). I can go out on the Ottawa River in my fishing boat and I will be checked by the opp probably 75% of the times I go out. I go out on the same river with my 26 ft cruiser sometimes for a week at a time and I have never been approached by the cops. Not once in 12 years. Go figure.

I guarantee you those who are anti Police are the first ones to call for help when they need them. I don't care if there is or isn't a quota system for generating revenue for fines. The income from fines do not go into the budget for Policing anyway so why do all that paper work? I wouldn't.  If I speed and get a speeding ticket how exactly is that the Cops fault?  I don't speed therefor I don't get tickets. oops had 1 speeding ticket 3 years ago, my first in 35 years. Even then he knocked down a 95 in a 50 to 65 in a 50, he could have really hammered me but didn't because it was actually a fair person I dealt with and he was met with respect when he came to my window.  I have to add, as soon as I saw him come over the hill towards me and hammer on the brakes I pulled over without him even turning on his lights before he did a U turn."

917061,misfish,2015-05-26 19:50:00,29133,"This past weekend,there was a group of people at the barrie launch to help those understand what they needed for their boats. COMPLY WITH THE LAWS.  There was no fee or anything. They helpped you launch your boat and went over a check list with the owner. These were not the police, but a boaters group. I watched two boats go through their inspections. There was nothing major with either one, but both failed to produce a working flash light. And yes, they had the orange pee buckets. Once the check was done,they were given a copy of the list of things they checked. I thought it was pretty cool to see. Boaters helpping boaters.  Last year I was inspected on the water by the OPP while on my toon. I was told I required  one of those floating ropes. No big deal. They advised and left me to fish  away.   If you just treat them like they were your friend,they will look at you the same.( I hope they do anyways) Give them flak , then your just looking for trouble.  PS  I like that I have my camera straped to the toon. Just a quick push of the button, and it records. Just encase."
917063,Old Ironmaker,2015-05-26 19:57:00,8243,"I find it ironic that some complain about the nit picking cop checking safety equipment on the water are sometimes the same that complain about all the boaters out there that have no clue about water safety or responsible boating. No one likes a nit picking Cop, I have never met one though. The last check one cop carefully removed a treble hook stuck in the mesh of my inflatable while the other did the safety check and said nothing about the Beer can in my passengers cup holder! The only fail I had was that because the inflatable doesn't count unless I'm wearing it I didn't have another PDF within easy reach, it was buried in a hold below the fenders.  No more Beer in my boat rule kicked in after that and all PDF's on the back of each seat.  Also Brian that is a fantastic idea and service those boaters did for everyone. I don't know how well it would be received by that guy waiting in line while a safety check is going on at the ramp.  I don't think however any Cop want's to be treated like a friend by Joe Public. They want to be treated with respect which is mutual. If I treated a cop like I treat my friends I might end up in jail as I can be a ball buster with friends but I wouldn't try that with a law enforcement agent, no way."

A few years back myself & Wayne (Irishfield) were casting the West Arm of Nip and were visited by the local OPP boat. He asked for all the usual stuff but said he couldn't see any PFD's and I told him they were in the locker just below my feet. He said they weren't easily accessible sitting in a locker and suggested if we weren't gonna wear them, he'd rather see them hanging over the back of the seat.  Made sense to me and now-a-days that's where they are all the time even if I'm wearing the auto-inflate.

Stopping the same boat or snow mobile over and over is nothing but harassment and the only reason they can get away with that bull crap is because we are a small group that has no lobby power. Do that to people in cars / trucks / buses and see the crap hit the fan by the 6pm TV news.  Now if there was a couple fatal boating accidents in Lake X then I could see a blitz being warranted. But just to be out there harassing guys fishing is just bull crap IMHO and BTW I see fishermen being targeted more then anybody else because we are the easiest targets compared to jet bikes, water skiers and boater that never slow down to be bothered.

On another note, I sure wish some of these kawartha tinners would hold up that cheap light from the safety kit while out jigging for pickerel in the main navigation channels without running lights.

We were in a cabin on Nippissing and a couple guys from the next cabin were out in a boat when they were stopped. They were each wearing life jackets and had 2 more laying on the seats beside them. The one being worn by the boat driver had a tear in the back and he was given a fine for that, even though the 2 spare jackets were in good shape. He told the cop he didn't even have to lawfully wear a jacket but preferred to be safe. Rather than just suggesting he put on a better jacket the cop pulled the power trip card and hit him heavy in his wallet.  Absolutely NO need for that kind of harrassment."

Nothing worst than the same boat stopping you 2 or 3 times in the same day.   :wallbash:  I've got a couple of flash lights, a floating one and replaced the crappy one that came with the kit with a waterproof one.  Another idea that was shared with me a while back was to have some glow sticks on board.  No batteries required and last for hours as an auxiliary light source.  If you're floating in the water at night, it would certainly provide some light for signaling.  The other thing I have on my life jackets, are automatic strobe lights.  Water hits them and they start to flash.  Also have flares, have more stuff than you need to have and that can't be a bad thing."

So I pull out the dollar store flashlight that is supplied with the kit and look at the police. They are smiling with anticipation....I think I put new batteries last season. My thumb on the button thinking to myself ..""this is going to be expensive if this baby doesn't light up"" Well it lights up just barely enough to get me off the hook. So take a minute and check your flashlights are working and be safe on the water."
916919,BillM,2015-05-26 01:04:00,17367,I have some flares in there just in case the flashlight is dead.
916920,LostAnotherOne,2015-05-26 01:04:00,956,That's what I always say.  Give them nothing to say so you wont have any problems.
916925,porkpie,2015-05-26 01:13:00,2521,"I have real safety equipment for emergencies, and then I have the orange kit from Canadian tire that I hold up for marine police.  I check my batteries every spring and throw an extra set of double A's in the bottom of the orange kit.  Keeps me out of trouble!  Good reminder."
916927,LostAnotherOne,2015-05-26 01:15:00,956,"Even when it comes to the whistle.  I'm pretty sure, but not 100% that it has to be pealess."
916931,Gallie,2015-05-26 01:20:00,1215,"I keep a waterproof flashlight and whistle in my tackle box at all times. Even my big boat only barely hits 20 foot but i carry flares, throw rope in a bag, fire ext, compass, anchor, whistle, flashlight etc... Only thing i dont have is a radar reflector. Better to be safe then sorry."
916932,Musky or Specks,2015-05-26 01:26:00,2710,"O.P.P., how can I explain itI'll take it frame by frame itTo have y'all all jumping, shouting, saying itO is for other, P is for peoples', scratch your templeThe last P, well that's not that simpleIt's sort of like, well, another way to call a cat a kittenIt's five little letters that are missing here   Couldn't help myself."
916933,chris.brock,2015-05-26 01:28:00,4053,"What a stupid game to play IMO.  Hey OPP, go do something in my best interest like catching criminals."
916935,Gerritt,2015-05-26 01:28:00,6129,You down with OPP? Yeah you know me!
916937,irishfield,2015-05-26 01:42:00,26272,"Even if you have brand new batteries in the boat (even in the pee bucket with the flashlight) and the useless little flashlight doesn't work.. you get the fine. OPP had a hay day with some of our neighbours last year because they bought the orange pee bucket and threw it in the boat without loading the batteries in the flashlight. Like the thing is ever going to get you home. I hold up my 10 million candle power, blind them showing it works and I always get ""is it waterproof?"" !"
916940,chris.brock,2015-05-26 02:00:00,4053,"Damn, my whistle isn't pealess.  I also pack enough freeze dried rations to sustain myself for 3 years and have my loaded 12 gauge within reach at all times. Cottage country is dangerous country."
916941,DRIFTER_016,2015-05-26 02:01:00,10439,"I don't miss the marine Nazi's of Ontario. All I get to deal with here are conservation officers. It's actually nice being asked for licenses and such. In 8 years here I have been asked more than the entire time live in Ontario. When I was in Ontario and lived in Mississauga I fished Lake O almost daily and the Peel Marine Unit checked me almost daily for my safety gear and license because they were too stupid to remember they checked me yesterday, and the day before, and the day before..........."
916949,Tom McCutcheon,2015-05-26 03:18:00,627,It bothers me when I hear all the flak directed towards the folks everyone expects to rescue them when trouble happens on the water. I understand that we may get pulled over while we are fishing for a ten minute discussion regarding safety equipment. Heaven forbid we lose out on perhaps one or two fish. The reason the rules are there is for the simple reason of trying to prevent a tragedy on the water. Some people don't follow the rules and hence the need to inspect and enforce. It's a tough job and they just cannot please everyone.
916950,mr blizzard,2015-05-26 03:25:00,1589,"I agree with Drifter big time, the marine patrol might be one thing BUT my brother who is 20 years older than me who did serve with the OPP had his frigin knee cap blow out by a bullet back in the day when Parry Sound still had their own police force, they asked for assistance from the OPP , my brother resonded to help them and it almost cost him his life, and yes there were no portables back then, he limped back to his cruiser and by the gace of God he is still alive in a nursing home just outside of Bobcageon, his wife is still living in his original home just outside of town, And yes there is also a picture and plag of when he chased a stolen car with some (bad ) guys at the Aurora detachment formerly OAK RIDGES from HWY 11 north towards Bradford. At the bend just past what is know the drive thru at TIMS there used to be an abandoned brick building, my brothers cruiser went thru it and tore the top of the cruiser off, he still went over across the parking lot and pulled the suspect who was face down in some water so he would not drown. He was awarded a medal from Ottawa, when I call him at 72 often he  does not know who I am.  Please be careful how u judge, but in fairness he was from old school, real school with all do respect BLIZZ"
916952,mr blizzard,2015-05-26 03:59:00,1589,"What a stupid game to play IMO.  Hey OPP, go do something in my best interest like catching criminals. My brother did and it almost cost him his life, would u have taken his place that night ,,,I doubt it, it ia amazing how people can talk tough behind a glass screen , I can tell you where he is , maybe you should go visit him and thank him for 30 years of life changing service"
916955,Freshtrax,2015-05-26 04:39:00,2215,I got no problem with police ( ask me ten years ago I would have given you a different answer).  I've had some bad run ins like the ticket in a canoe for no buoyant throw rope.   We both had life jackets on at the time.   But getting stopped every damn day on the snowmobile sometimes 3 times a day really pissed me off.  I can only imagine while fishing on lake o and having to pull lines every time.

I've never been stopped out on Lake O, lol."
916957,Old Ironmaker,2015-05-26 04:42:00,8243,"I had a feeling this thread might take an abrupt turn. Compliance with the Marine legislation is one thing being safe is completely different. What in the Lords name is that little orange ball on the end of that thin nylon rope going to do for a 300 pound drowning man? I actually found my flashlight in the glove box and turned it on last week and it works. Infinicell AA rechargeable batteries, there's a shameless plug for you whoever you are..The Black and Decker  I don't know how many million candle power however does not work anymore, it's 4 months old, bought for the boat because it's waterproof and is a real light but it does not freakin work. Now I have to fight with Home Hardware because their return policy is 30 days.  I knew this thread would take a turn once I read the first anti OPP comment. Not fair at all as I know 90% or more of our Cops do the best job they can with the tools and protocol they are given to work with. Sometimes I think people should get out of Canada for a while, not 2 weeks in Florida or Mexico and I guarantee you if you have had to deal with cops from a second and third world company you will hug and kiss the first cop you see here."
916958,Freshtrax,2015-05-26 05:40:00,2215,  I was actually worried when I saw them this passed Sunday .  I didn't have paddles with me like I'm supposed to. Like I'm gonna paddle a 22 ft boat 3 miles  to shore.
916963,manitoubass2,2015-05-26 09:28:00,11391,"Those ""pee buckets"" dont work here.  OPP or MNR same the same thing everytime ""that rope doesnt float"".  If your from Ontario your fine, but from the states and your fined.  Ive got no issues with OPP.  As a teen, well actually I shouldnt go there.  These days im polite to them and they are in return.  Not that I havent had to shake my head at them a few times.  Safety gear is important. Ive almost lost my life on the lakes once, I try very hard to avoid that now."
916967,Roy,2015-05-26 10:28:00,13728," I was actually worried when I saw them this passed Sunday . I didn't have paddles with me like I'm supposed to. Like I'm gonna paddle a 22 ft boat 3 miles to shore. No one is ""supposed"" to have paddles aboard their boat. What you need is a manual propelling device (paddle) OR an anchor. So if you had an anchor, you were safe."
916968,porkpie,2015-05-26 10:29:00,2521,"These threads always take a turn because of 3 or 4 or guys who are on every website from guitar sites, car sites to fishing sites who hate authority, and any kind of law enforcement.  They will tell you otherwise, that they just don't like the silly little laws, but in reality they hate the police.  It would be much easier if they where just honest about it with themselves and everyone else.  At least then your bias is out in the open.  There are a lot of things I can't abide, but at least I'm up front about them."

You might be right about a few nut cases but MANY, especially older people have seen our Liberties dwindle away each and every year because of WAY TOO MUCH GOVERNMENT in our lives. We don't need to be taken care of from the cradle to the grave IMHO.  Someday you too might see that the light at the end of the tunnel is going out and once it's gone it will never return."
916975,DanD,2015-05-26 11:01:00,2223,"I remember a few years back, the OPP were handing out stickers for your boat, if you passed an inspection. Are they not doing that anymore? It seemed like a good idea; especially on days like bass opener or Pottahawk pissup weekend, on Long Point Bay; where it was nothing to get stopped a few times a day, during those days.  Dan."
916977,Steve,2015-05-26 11:15:00,2075,no...i asked three years ago for a sticker....apparently that was a voluntary thing that is no longer being done.
