920638,manitoubass2,2015-06-18 18:18:00,11391,Kinda a bummer. Part of me says sell and upgrade.  The other part says nah. Lets enjoys this camper
920658,leaf4,2015-06-18 22:00:00,2466,"Lol I would take the 6200 and run laughing maniacally all the way to the bank, but thats just me haha"
920664,manitoubass2,2015-06-18 22:47:00,11391,"Yeah, I figured as much.  I might just keep it though, I think it suits my mom( and it is a gift for her)  I just thought it was funny, that americans pull off the highway and make offers right away.  Same thing happened with our old sled"
920685,DanD,2015-06-19 10:56:00,2223,"Just some things that have come to mind, while following this thread. With the age of this trailer, I would be doing a complete inspection of the propane system. Mix up some dish wash soap and water in a spray bottle; open every window/vent in the trailer; turn the propane on and spray every connection that you can find; if there's a leak the bubbles will show you. The rubber hose between the propane tank and hard lines of the trailer; check it for any weather checking or rot. Light the cook stove, the flame should be a bluish white. If the flame is orange with some soot; there's ether dirty air bleeds in the tubes between the propane nozzles and the burners; spiders love to make nests in there. Or the propane regulator (again due to its age) might be allowing to much pressure into the system. If only for piece of mind, I would replace the regulator and hose; cheap insurance that nothing going to happen. Before you decide to tow this thing anywhere, find out when the wheel bearings were last serviced. If its been a couple of years or your friend doesn't remember; pull them, wash, inspect or replace. If you are going to start towing; CAA Plus with an RV package, will tow the tow vehicle and the trailer, if there's break down. It saved the beginning of a weeks camping for us. Transmission blew on the Chevy about half way to where we were going. Called CAA they hook onto the car with one truck and the trailer with another. Me and the car went to my shop; the trailer went on to the camp grounds with the family. On the way to the shop, I called the wrecking yard and asked them to deliver a transmission. Get to the shop, swap out the trans and I was at the camp grounds that night for supper. LOL  Dan."
920697,manitoubass2,2015-06-19 14:56:00,11391,"I did the propane check yesterday dan. Great info to add in here though.  No leaks and no damage I could find. The propane system has a diagram so I was able to check everything.  Im not 100 percent sure we will be using the propane system though, at least not much(rainy days maybe)  I still have all my camping gear to haul with too so I have coleman stoves etc to cook on outdoors.  The bearings I have not checked, great idea. But if something was amiss, shouldnt I have noticed it on the hour drive home? She pulled very nice, basically not even there. No pulling or rattling. Trailer weight is pretty light, around 750 lbs naked.  Anything else you can think of to check dan?  Thanks for the help?"
920699,DanD,2015-06-19 15:20:00,2223,"Most times while driving/towing, you won't feel that a bearing is about to fail until it does. If you're not into pulling them apart to check; at least lift the wheels off the ground and give them a good hard spin. If you hear any squeaking or growling or excessive play from the hub; you'd best pull them apart and see who's asking for attention.  Dan."
920701,manitoubass2,2015-06-19 15:49:00,11391,Okay I did that before I bought it. Jacked it up and the tires spun very nice.  The ender carage looks good too.  I think I will replace the hose and regulator just to be safe
920702,manitoubass2,2015-06-19 15:50:00,11391,Only odd thing about the propane was the fridge. It gets too cold and there is no temp control on it.  Oven looks great
920711,DanD,2015-06-19 16:26:00,2223,"It's an ammonia fridge that uses a small propane heating element, to create a high pressure side and cause the ammonia to flow through the evaperator. Check that the fridge's venting to the outside is not restricted. You could also check the heating element that it's not burnt through allowing a bigger flame then it should have. That old 72 that I had, would freeze everything inside it; until I installed a ball valve and could turn down the propane going to the heating element. It was fussy as all get out to get it set; but once set it worked pretty good.  Dan."
920716,Walleye72,2015-06-19 16:41:00,156,750 lbs?????  Are you sure.  I would think it would weigh far more than that if it's built like a tank.
920717,manitoubass2,2015-06-19 16:47:00,11391," Its got no dents or anything, undercarage seems well built, thats where my comment came from.  Its not actually an army tank???  And its 17ft but that includes the frame all the way up to the hitch. So the actual inside Id say is more like 14-15ft"
920721,Walleye72,2015-06-19 17:34:00,156,"You're probably right.  I'm just remembering my parent's 18 footer that looked similar to yours.  I think it was a 1972 - 1975 model year.  My Dad would remember, and I think it weighed over 2000 lbs.  I'll ask him.  Not that it really matters.  I was just curious is all."
920722,manitoubass2,2015-06-19 17:37:00,11391,"Nah ask him, im curious as well.  Maybe i misread ill double check"
920723,manitoubass2,2015-06-19 17:40:00,11391,My bad. 750 kg  So abit over 1500lbs
920375,manitoubass2,2015-06-17 05:15:00,11391,"Just bought a 1971 camper for my mom. So stoked. Built like a brick you know what.  18 footer all brand new tires, all brand new matresses, sleeps four. New oven and fridge and potty. $1200  Soooo stoked"
920377,lew,2015-06-17 08:17:00,12766,Your gonna be travelling in style now !!  Great buy.
920378,Big Cliff,2015-06-17 08:24:00,6899,"Wow, sounds like a super deal, just the tires and mattresses would have been worth that!"
920382,DanD,2015-06-17 10:28:00,2223,"Just bought a 1971 camper for my mom. So stoked. Built like a brick you know what.  18 footer all brand new tires, all brand new matresses, sleeps four. New oven and fridge and potty. $1200  Soooo stoked  So when you selling it?     I think huzzsada might be in the market for one?  Just joking around. LOL  You and the family will love it. My kids use to have sleep overs with their friends in our trailer, when it was parked at home. That old 72 Holiday trailer got a lot of use.  Dan."
920398,mr blizzard,2015-06-17 13:34:00,1589,"Congrats Rick, now you have no excuse to come up here for a couple of days of fishing lol Enjoy sounds like a sweet deal"
920410,manitoubass2,2015-06-17 15:14:00,11391,"Lol @ dan. Its for my mom, only sleeps four so although im sure I will use it occasionally its still the big old tent for me?  I still cant believe the price!!!! I gues they had offers up to 3 grand yesterday but I used to chum with her son so I think I got lucky haha.  And they just bought a new 5th wheel so they wanted it gone quick.  I sure hope my mom likes it when she gets here late july!!!"
920420,manitoubass2,2015-06-17 16:22:00,11391,DanD what size was your trailer?
920422,manitoubass2,2015-06-17 16:24:00,11391,"Here is an outside pic. Its older, tires have been swapped for 4 tread  "
920424,DanD,2015-06-17 16:27:00,2223,"That Holiday was a 17 footer, built like a tank and weighed about as much as one. LOL  Dan."
920425,manitoubass2,2015-06-17 16:32:00,11391,Hahahha awesome
920426,manitoubass2,2015-06-17 16:34:00,11391,
920428,manitoubass2,2015-06-17 16:35:00,11391, If thats the case Im coming for at least a week lol
920430,mr blizzard,2015-06-17 16:55:00,1589,"Where are ya these days? I thought you were WAY up north?  If thats the case Im coming for at least a week lol I am, but i am sure your mom would let u borrow it   just bring a spare tire and a map lol"
920433,manitoubass2,2015-06-17 17:15:00,11391,"Where are ya?  And I already have a spare tire, do I need two????"
920434,manitoubass2,2015-06-17 17:16:00,11391,Shes not here till the end of july so I plan on using it afew times and doing some minor tweaks.
920435,manitoubass2,2015-06-17 17:18:00,11391,"Here is a question, since I never bought a camper before.  I got the ownership papers and receipt. How do I transfer it over?  And what about insurance? Does it need its own or if i call it in is it covered under our current vehicle?"
920503,manitoubass2,2015-06-17 22:31:00,11391,"Old betty is home!!!!  Everything works great, its a tad bit smaller then I had thought, and its older then I though lol, its from 1959!!!! Hahaha  So stoked on ol betty, might take her for a solo mission this weekend!"
920508,chris.brock,2015-06-17 22:56:00,4053,"They don't make'em like they used to. Good score Rick.  What's your Mom going to do with it, park it, or road trips?"
920510,manitoubass2,2015-06-17 23:05:00,11391,"Fishing trips/camping and its a way for her to have some privacy when she visits. She lives alone right now, moving in with us is gonna be a huge shock lol.  Plus the girls can use it for sleepovers etc"
920514,Big Cliff,2015-06-17 23:30:00,6899,"Sue and I bought a trailer when our son bought his place in French River. It was an older used one but not in bad shape. Well, we loved it!!!!!! Wwe had our own space when we wanted it, the kids had their own space. All summer we would have them over for dinners, the grandkids would come to visit when they wanted, they would have us over for dinners man that was some wonderful times. Winters we didn't use it much, the furnace didn't quite keep it warm at about -10 and running electric heaters was a bit of a hassle. The other thing that we had to sort out was septic but we did. Water was easy, just a hose.   I am sure this will be one of those ""wow"" investments!!!!!"
920568,manitoubass2,2015-06-18 04:58:00,11391,"Absolutely cliff!  First thing the wife says is ""so when do we christen it""?  The kids are in bed(in the house) and....  If the camper is a rockin ????"
920576,DanD,2015-06-18 11:20:00,2223,"Here is a question, since I never bought a camper before.  I got the ownership papers and receipt. How do I transfer it over?  And what about insurance? Does it need its own or if i call it in is it covered under our current vehicle?  To transfer the ownership, go to any licensing office. Due to the trailer's age, not sure what they'll base the taxes on? They (license office) may have a pricing schedule for trailers, like they do for vehicles; if so they'll tax you on whatever amount is higher; their schedule; or your recite. If you payed cash and the previous owner is game; who knows what that recite might read?  Highway liability insurance for the trailer, should piggyback onto the tow vehicle's insurance; but check with your broker. Contents insurance should be covered by your house insurance; but again check with your broker.  Our 36 foot park model trailer, had to have its own policy, due to it supposedly being classed as a ""second/weekend home""; the trailer park insisted?   Dan"
920594,manitoubass2,2015-06-18 13:46:00,11391,"Good info Dan, thanks.  Turns out I stopped by yesterday ans it was easy peezy. Paid a few bucks in taxes and had to pay 40 for new plates.  Today im calling insurance but i do believe you hit the nail on the head with that."
920614,manitoubass2,2015-06-18 15:53:00,11391,"Wth are these trailers worth? Its not even 11 am and 3 people have stopped in offering 3000, 5000, and 6200.  Alot of people must show interest in these old camper trailers  Its a 1959 Layton 17ft"
920616,manitoubass2,2015-06-18 15:56:00,11391,"Before I bought it I talked to some people yesterday.  One said if immaculate, id pay no more then $800  Then my father in law(a mechanic and collector of anything with a motor lol) said $1200 is an absolute steal"
