914747,kickingfrog,2015-05-12 02:32:00,8333,"So the discussion around the mother's day dinner table turned to a cottage retail this summer. I figured it would be worthwhile to either see what was available here, or at least what others have done.  5-7 days sometime between Saturday August 22nd and Sunday August 30th.  Three pairs of adults 4 (maybe 2) kids age 4-8 1, maybe 2 dogs  Less then 5 hour drive from Barrie preferable. Dockage for 1, maybe 2 boats-16 foot and a Launch somewhere near by. Swimming area for the kids.  Personally I'd really like some solid fishing for some combination of walleye/pike/musky/lakers, but at least some bass and panfish for the kids will do. It's not about me, it's not about me. It is not about me.  Budget is somewhat flexible (Yay for grandparents) although hot and cold running maids is likely too posh for us and 3 of the women and 1 of the men (No, it wasn't me) said they're not using a thunder box or outhouse.  I'm a big fan of, and know, Nipissing but Temagami would also be high on my list... even though it's not about me."

Protected area for the kids to swim off the dock.. docks front and back of island and town boat launch is only 3000 feet away. Beer 4000...  Have to appreciate the propeller twack of a Beaver at 8am..."
914766,wormdunker,2015-05-12 06:41:00,1711,Lots of lodges/cottages on the French River.  We have stayed at Wolsely Lodge many times & the fish you are seeking are available.  I'm not too sure about fishing in August - we usually book there in late September.

914941,irishfield,2015-05-13 01:31:00,26272,"Okay.. I'll try to find out. Owner lives on Vancouver Island, his sister-in-law in Elk Lake. She's the possible caretaker, as our other neighbours won't do it anymore.  Only 3 of us on the island with 3 acres each. One of us has a 175' water slide... LOL, but not certain we'll be up there at all this summer.  Oh.. and the PPark is directly across if you want to put the kids on a sand beach. Boat over and drop them off on your way out to fish..."
914964,Nipfisher,2015-05-13 02:56:00,2449,www.glenrock.ca  I sent you a PM.
914994,kickingfrog,2015-05-13 11:49:00,8333,Thanks. At this point our goal is a private cottage but lodge/resortsavn't been ruled out.  I might also go a little more nutts as well. For now island/boat access cottages have been  vetoed. Thanks anyway Wayne. Maybe if it is on the market I could buy it since the inlaws won't come via boat.
915026,irishfield,2015-05-13 14:22:00,26272,Well you won't get a drive to cottage on Lake Temagami Rob.. there are two (other than the homes right on the waterfront in town). One is inside the PPark and the other possible rental looks across at Temagami Marine in inlet bay and is owned by Judy Garah (Lakeland Airways owners Mother)
915049,kickingfrog,2015-05-13 16:47:00,8333,This no island thing was a surprise to me. I had also found one on Georgian bay that had everything but it was clear that staying on an island had never even crossed their minds. I'm hoping that they will come around after a bit.
919860,kickingfrog,2015-06-13 18:31:00,8333,ttt.  We've narrowed it down but thought I'd get this to the top before the final decision.
919912,adempsey,2015-06-14 04:28:00,1498,Some nice looking places on Lac Kipawa.
