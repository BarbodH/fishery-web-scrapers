I would think a regular 9.9 would do, however, I am sure there is a reason why they make a motor that is strictly meant as a kicker.  Any advice for one or the other?  Thanks"
920146,BillM,2015-06-15 20:59:00,17367,"Deeper gear case, 4 blade prop, different gear ratios.  It's actually designed as a kicker motor, not a something you'd drop on a 12ft tinny.  Should be easy to compare at the link below.  https://www.mercurymarine.com/en/ca/engines/outboard/fourstroke/8-99-hp/"
920147,misfish,2015-06-15 21:09:00,29133,The kicker  Terry runs on his boat is more then enough to keep up even with 2-3 ft waves while trolling.  He can explain what he has better then I. The cruise control speed set up he has is awesome.
920153,dave524,2015-06-15 22:03:00,4508,Get the long shaft and one with electric start and a alternator as well. Depending on how its mounted a pull start can be very awkward.

The cruise control speed set up he has is awesome. Yup, the high thrust motors are intended more for slow speed, definitely not going to win any races."
920191,Hooked,2015-06-16 00:56:00,891,"The link appears to not exist Bill.  The key is definitely to get under 1.5 while trolling in most conditions.  I seen the kicker at bps, definitely looks different,"
