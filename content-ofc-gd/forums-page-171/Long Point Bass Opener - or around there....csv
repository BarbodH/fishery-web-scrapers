920585,DanD,2015-06-18 12:30:00,2223,"There is a launch at the Long Point Provencal park, not far past the entrance gate; the fee is included with your park pass. I don't think you'll find a beach bay side; it's mostly marsh. There are slips at the launch, that are first come first served; but I wouldn't leave the boat unsupervised or things will likely grow legs. Not sure but I don't think there is accessible electrics at these slips. The last time we camped and fished out of the park; we'd ramp the boat and brought it back to our site. It's not like you have to secure everything for the 2 minute ride to the camp site. If you're wanting to go for opener, you better get on the phone and try and reserve a site; the place fills up in a hurry.  Dan."
920600,bow slayer,2015-06-18 13:59:00,1074,"yes there are no waterfront sites to beach your boat on like lakes in the north,as mentioned the park has a good ramp and several slips but again as mentioned I would be very hesitent on leaving it over night. there are electric sites in the park to charge your battery if you book one,if not there are a couple marinas there that would charge it for you for a small fee."

920610,Old Ironmaker,2015-06-18 15:37:00,8243,Long Point will be and is always a Zoo for opening. I would pick another weekend if it were I. I have seen line ups at ramps 15 deep for opening there.
920613,bow slayer,2015-06-18 15:52:00,1074,"unbelievable the busiest day and weekend for the area marinas and businesses and they are closing the road for 25 runners,who makes these descisions."
920642,KraTToR,2015-06-18 19:24:00,506,"Thanks everyone. Top notch information as usual   DanD, good idea and you are absolutely correct, doesn't take much to move the boat back and forth from the campsite.  It looks like the plan will be the week following the opener anyways and I'm sure it will be still busy.  About the marathon timing.."
920656,dave524,2015-06-18 21:45:00,4508,"Think it is the busiest the weekend of the Pottohawk P-Up, it was fun many moons ago. Bass fishing in the am. party time in the pm."
