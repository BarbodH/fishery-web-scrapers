920436,mistaredone,2015-06-17 17:26:00,913,I'm having problems with my power trim. I called a marine guy and he told me to top up the fluid. Do I need marine specific trim and steering fluid or would auto steering fluid be the same thing?
920437,davew3,2015-06-17 17:32:00,430,Are you having issues with both control buttons ?   shifter and on the motor ?
920438,DRIFTER_016,2015-06-17 17:32:00,10439,You can use power steering fluid or transmission fluid to top off your hydraulics. What is the issue you are having? I have repaired a bunch of PT&T units for people over  the years. Fixed 2 boats just 2 Saturdays back.
920439,mistaredone,2015-06-17 17:40:00,913,"At first it was making a bit of a struggling sound at full trim up then it wasn't engaging at the top, worked fine in the lower range up and down but now it's fully up and won't move at all. It's making noise like normal but not engaging"
920440,mistaredone,2015-06-17 17:41:00,913,Shifter and motor controls have same results
920445,davew3,2015-06-17 18:17:00,430,Well seeing as this is a sealed system if you do not see any leaks then it would be electrical.  Find the relay on the motor and see if it has worked loose.  If not remove it and have it checked / replaced.  It may just be a loose connection.  regards
920447,mistaredone,2015-06-17 18:22:00,913,Thanks as always guys!  A few oz of steering fluid did the job. I'll keep an eye out for leaks
