It rained half the time but I had a chance to fish the old Ausable channel while I was there.  Got out for a good hour and was only getting small fish that were too small to even bite bait.  I was using yellow and white grub.  Finally went to another section which was quite shallow and had a lot of grass/weed.  Every cast came back with a handful of green.  Finally I decided to cast and reel back in as fast as I could literally reeling in as soon as the lure hit the water.  I noticed a splash but whatever it was missed the bait. I cast out again in the same spot and same fish goes after my bait and then fish was on!  Reeled it in and it turned out to be a grass pickeral.  It was a adult size since from what I read they only grow up to be around 30 cms or so and this one was right around that size. I tried to get a photo but it slipped out of my hands as I went to pick it up and swam away  .  Anyhow, it was quite fun trying to rip through the weeds and nice to catch my first I guess you can say pike!   .  They are a fish of special concern so I was planning on releasing it regardless but it took off before I could do anything lol.  For those that havent seen one before here is a photo of one. Looks just like pike but a nice green with dark green stripes. "

920152,davey buoy,2015-06-15 22:00:00,5505,Still a lot of fun I'm sure.!
920160,Musky or Specks,2015-06-15 22:39:00,2710,Next time your in the area you should check out Parkhill and Morrison for fishing. Way better fishing than the river.
920163,huzzsaba,2015-06-15 22:43:00,884,"I would have explored the area as well as the pier in grand bend, but the rain didnt let us do much.  I will check those places you mentioned when I go back in the future."
920171,bow slayer,2015-06-15 23:31:00,1074,there is some big bass and dogfish in the weedy areas below the little tunnel the passes under the road where the park store is. We also use to catch quite a few crappy there as well.
