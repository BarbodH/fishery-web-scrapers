920237,crappieperchhunter,2015-06-16 14:07:00,2582,Just noticed this Bruce. Congratulations. Being a Grandparent is the best of both worlds. You can enjoy them when they are good and send them home with mom and dad when there not so good   I'm sure you'll have her enjoying the outdoors and fishing in no time.
