So this year we booked June 6 and it was about perfect!!!!This year AirDale is using Watson's Skyways out of Wawa for their flying. An extremely efficient company and a pleasure to fly with,We were scheduled for a 9am flight we arrived at the airbase at 8, I said to the dock lad we are a little early. He replied back your truck in here and we will get your gear weighed. We were weighed, loaded on plane and in the air at 9:20On our return flight we were to be picked up at 10 am the Otter touched down at 10:02I must add we had perfect weather for our flight days, Sunny and light windsWatsons OtterThe fishing was amazing we caught more small fish this year, as many 14 - 17 inchers as you could possibly want, but also got into some big ones.My 28 1/2 incher was the biggestMy buddy Pat got a 27"" which I do not have a picture of Also a bunch from 22-25 inchesA double header     Shore   Lunch  As for Pike Well there was an unlimited number of mid 20 inch fish, Just cast or troll the shoreline and you will be busy unhooking Pike. My fishing partner did get a thick 37 incher that was our biggest.One tactic that was lethal on the smaller Walleye was on days with blue bird skies and glass smooth water when the points and shoals that produced so well in the evening were slow   We moved deeper into 32FOw and vertical jigged with a worm, It was like ice fishing for Perch there were loads of fish and you could barely get the jig to the bottom without having a bite.And a huge big thank you to Martin and Jenn of OutPostCamps.com It was a pleasure to vacation with you once againCheersRick"

920544,Joeytier,2015-06-18 01:42:00,3990,"Wow, lots of big fish.  Looks like a blast!"
920548,Jds63,2015-06-18 02:02:00,1365,Good to see you back out there Rick ! Looks like you guys had a great time ... the old hockey stick transducer mount brings back memories .... LOL
920554,chris.brock,2015-06-18 02:42:00,4053,"Very cool Rick, sounds like a great week up there. Sleek looking Otter they have.  Just curious, what are you guys thinking for next year?"
920612,SylvanOwner,2015-06-18 15:43:00,266,Nice going Rick.  That big girl is very respectable!  Looks like it might've been caught in the back bay where I told you I got my big 1?
920655,RickOnt,2015-06-18 21:44:00,669,"Yes Mike 'anticipation'  Big time   After I had to cancel out of a trip in Sept due to hip surgery and four months later I had knee surgery To say I was pumped is an understatement!!!  Joey  Lots of quality fish It was 'fun'  Julian  That is a Canadian thing!!  LOL   But I think I am dating myself with an aluminum Easton  Chris   Not sure where Yet  As much as I have enjoyed Apisabigo There are too many other great spots, I am in search mode right now.  Sylvan   That one was not caught in the back bay but my buddy got his 27 incher in there!!"
920671,can u fish,2015-06-19 01:45:00,326,Nice looking walleyes there Rick looks like you boys had a great trip that lake was on my radar for my up and coming annual September fly in unfortunately Martin only offers a few  outpost camps now where he is willing to fly two guys in Which are Abbey Lake and Anjigaming I have already fished those two lakes anyway thanks for the report and great photos.  Cheers Mitch
920727,adempsey,2015-06-19 18:32:00,1498,"Looks like you had a great trip!   Have you checked out Nameigos?   It's about 3x the size of Apisabigo.  Never been, but curious about it."

Cheers Mitch Might be worth checking out Buck & Bingwood, Twin Lakes or White River Air if you haven't already booked  I always thought this 2-man super light special from 7 Lakes Wilderness Camps was interesting as well [which I am too fat to do!]."
