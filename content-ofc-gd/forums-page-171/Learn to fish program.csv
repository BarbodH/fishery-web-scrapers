It’s offering the “learn to fish” program – a free, two-hour program combining a practical teaching session with an hour of supervised, hands-on fishing. Aspiring anglers will learn the basics like tying knots, knowing what kind of fish is on the hook and the rules and safety guidelines. All equipment, including rods, lures, life-jackets and a one-day fishing license will be provided free. There are six locations across the province including Darlington Provincial Park near Oshawa, Six Mile Lake north of Barrie and Earl Rowe near Alliston."

If you are strong enough to carry those bottles, cans, packages and cigarettes in when they are intact, you gotta be strong enough to carry them out empty.
