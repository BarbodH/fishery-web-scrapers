919306,anders,2015-06-10 01:29:00,1168,"thanks for kind replies guys, and for keeping a topic like this civil.  hahah"
920052,TDunn,2015-06-15 00:39:00,680,Nice fish! Would have fooled me..... I've  caught Atlantics on the superior side of the St Mary's dam when fishing whities in the summer. They definitely  get through!
918581,anders,2015-06-05 00:42:00,1168,I recently caught and released this gorgeous 27 inch fish. At first i thought it was a brown but more and more i am thinking its and atlantic.  it was caught in Lake Superior out in front of the Michipicoten.        
918583,Roy,2015-06-05 00:56:00,13728,Atlantic
918660,dave524,2015-06-05 14:54:00,4508,"Yep , pretty sure it is an Atlantic. It would have been better had you closed the mouth before the pic. I usually look at the back of the jaw in relation to the eye, much like bass, with the Brown being a largemouth and an Atlantic being a smallmouth."
918661,Musky or Specks,2015-06-05 14:58:00,2710,Atlantic the x's on the body are a dear give away and Sault Michigan stocks  a million of them.  Speaking of which an entertaing cam for fish. In a couple of weeks there will be thousands of Atlantics to veiw http://www.lssu.edu/arl/fishcam.php
918665,anders,2015-06-05 15:17:00,1168,"Thanks for the id guys   Sault Michigan is below the locks at the St. Mary's River, which is why i was a litle baffled at this.  the MIchipicoten is around 220 km north of the locks"
918677,Spiel,2015-06-05 16:26:00,9065,Atlantic.   Atlantic the x's on the body are a dear give away and Sault Michigan stocks  a million of them.    That's not really a good indicator MoS as Great Lake Browns when in bright silver can also display X shaped spotting.
918762,l2p,2015-06-05 23:22:00,346,"My thoughts exactly, im guna be the first and say its a brown"
918854,frozen-fire,2015-06-06 23:13:00,542,Brown!
918861,johnb,2015-06-07 00:43:00,15,Gonna say brown as well. Think atlantics have prominent spots on the cheek
918865,manitoubass2,2015-06-07 01:02:00,11391,Call mnr and ask them lol  I dont know how any of you guys tell these fish apart???  Just looks like a steelie to me ???
918867,Dozer,2015-06-07 01:04:00,896,One more for atlantic although it looks like a brown.  Clear adipose fin.
918877,anders,2015-06-07 02:23:00,1168,"this is a bad picture, but this one says brown to me????  :wallbash:  [/url]"">http://"
918884,danjang,2015-06-07 03:14:00,148,"Brown. Large mouth, looks like heavy spotting on the dorsal fin, caudal peduncle isn't as narrow as it should be. I also find that clean atlantics have a prominent black edging on the tail fin."
919012,highdrifter,2015-06-08 15:42:00,2534,ATLANTIC.
919033,Steve,2015-06-08 17:40:00,2075,"well, I'm going with a Brown Trout."
919037,manitoubass2,2015-06-08 17:53:00,11391,I know of two very small waterbodies in my house that get stocked with brown trout daily?
919088,Mike Pike,2015-06-08 21:53:00,1332,"How was the fight?  If it jumped, it's an Atlantic.  If not, it's a Brown.  There, it's settled."
919091,davey buoy,2015-06-08 21:58:00,5505,Why do they make these fish look so close ?  Just call it at Browntic lolol.
919094,dave524,2015-06-08 22:07:00,4508,"How was the fight?  If it jumped, it's an Atlantic.  If not, it's a Brown.  There, it's settled.  Exactly how I clued in to my first Atlantic over 20 years ago , flatlining inshore just east of here. They were even rarer back then."
919101,anders,2015-06-08 22:28:00,1168,"How was the fight?  If it jumped, it's an Atlantic.  If not, it's a Brown.  There, it's settled.    hahaha  thats what i thought...i always thought that the fight of an atlantic was 6 feet below and 6 feet above the surface.  This thing bulldoged.  I was just looking through my scott and crossman freshwater fishes of canada (which i should have done before), and its a brown  thanks everyone for the help"
919121,Acountdeleted,2015-06-09 00:14:00,2562,I would have called it an Atlantic for sure until the second photo. I'd say 'call the MNR' but only do that if you want them to waste another $10 000
919131,John Bacon,2015-06-09 01:22:00,3277,Atlantic/brown hybrid
919138,GBW,2015-06-09 02:33:00,8460,A(Atlantic)+B(Brown) = C C=Caught a nice fish..
919275,Steve,2015-06-09 22:47:00,2075,"it turned out to be a brown?  man, I've caught many browns and a few 'tics and I still say it's tough as heck to tell them apart (at least until they get bigger).  those 3lbs to 6lbs fish, which seem to be most common, are tough to tell them apart.  nice fish - no matter what it was!"
919295,Sharkbait22,2015-06-10 00:09:00,297,Cool find. Figured it was a brown. Many browns in Alberta jump when first hooked but that's about it.
