For some this weekend, and for others next weekend commences the long awaited bass season.  Where and what are you fishing?  I had a chance to fish Buckhorn this weekend but it fell through, so I am heading up to PAB to finish my casting deck in my tinner and get everything dialed in and ready for next weekend where I will be in my smallie honey hole at first light.  Ive had the 27th booked in my calendary since January, With a big 100 dollar order of baits in the mail, a new casting deck and trolling motor on the tinner. im all geared up and set to go.  A little pike fishing is going to have to tide me over this weekend"

I'll be heading up to the cottage in the parry sound area and hit the cottage lake on Saturday, and a back lake Sunday.  May even try Gbay.
