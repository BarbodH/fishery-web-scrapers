920569,musky666,2015-06-18 09:42:00,126,Seems late in coming- pretty sure the SWF has been in Lake Muskoka for quite a while now- I used to get a clump of them stuck at the swivel of my leader when deep trolling. Also- isn't it the SWF that has been a major factor in the declining Walleye stocks in Nipissing....
920590,irishfield,2015-06-18 13:02:00,26272,Been in Lake Temagami for over 15 years..
920608,Freshtrax,2015-06-18 15:21:00,2215,In a few smaller lakes just east of huntsville as well
920620,mike rousseau,2015-06-18 16:16:00,4661,Interesting that they don't seam to be in the St. Lawrence river (from what I have seen) considering the Great Lakes drain through it...  But I guess the little buggers probably don't like current....
920622,Roy,2015-06-18 16:28:00,13728,"Apparently they're in here, Mike. Lots of news about it recently. I haven't seen any myself though."
920625,irishfield,2015-06-18 16:40:00,26272,They like deeper water from what I have seen. I can troll all day in 60 FOW and never have one on the line.. drop the balls to 80 to 100FOW and up they come.
920631,manitoubass2,2015-06-18 17:40:00,11391,What are these?  Parasites that go for gills?
920632,buick14,2015-06-18 17:44:00,741,She makes for some good forage for certain species thats for sure
