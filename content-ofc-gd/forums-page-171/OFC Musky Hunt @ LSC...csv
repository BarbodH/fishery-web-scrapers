I was extremely impressed with the launch at Belle River Marina plus they have a few picnic sites.  I could negotiate room rates, launch rates, etc.  Maybe even have a little swap meet in the afternoon.  We could even do a bit of a tailgate party...  Just some food for thought, get some like-minds together and have an informal derby?... No prizes just braggin' rites ...  :worthy:   Thoughts?  Patrick.  "
920036,leaf4,2015-06-14 22:51:00,2466,I'd be in if someone were to offer a spot on their boat! Lol
920057,Rizzo,2015-06-15 01:30:00,4754,"Depends on when...wife just gave me a three day pass to St C so I doubt I will be back there anytime soon! As far as extra bodies on board that is generally a good thing on st clair. Extra people means extra lines allowed and increase your odds. For me, I find 3 guys on board is ideal. Gives you 6 lines and everyone has a role. One guy reels in fish, other guy nets it, 3rd guy controls the boat in sometimes ""adverse"" conditions."
920079,outllaw,2015-06-15 12:19:00,1232,"theres lots offered in the lsc region. one shortage in peak season is accomadations. .. just west of belle river is sandbar restaurant/ramp also. nice quiet launch. good depth. .Rochester campground also. but you need a 3 day booking ,camping/tent,with ramp/dockage."
920081,Rizzo,2015-06-15 12:49:00,4754,Sandbar...is that the one on the puce river?
920123,outllaw,2015-06-15 18:04:00,1232,"yes sandbar,s on the puce. quiet outa the way. but straight out from there is awesome first 2 months. then fish move deeper."
