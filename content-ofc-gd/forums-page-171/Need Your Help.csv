Seems a bunch of relief $$$$ were donated to help these folks after the tornadoes last June and the thoughtful Township of Essa hasn't bothered to distribute any of the funds to the people that need it.  http://www.thepetitionsite.com/771/944/476/give-angus-and-south-barrie-every-dollar-of-the-relief-money-already/
