920108,Rod Caster,2015-06-15 15:44:00,5784,2 weeks left! Crap. thanks for posting this. I gotta start herding cats.
920110,Christopheraaron,2015-06-15 15:51:00,3525,Good reminder Cliff! I've still got to get back up your way to drop off some salt.
920114,Big Cliff,2015-06-15 17:06:00,6899,Salt isn't that good for the fall. They will typically utilize salt the most during the warmer months when they are feeding on natural forages and browse. As the weather cools in the fall they tend to use it less and less frequently especially in areas where there are a lot of crops that they can forage on.  Corn/molasses/apples/carrots are all more effective.
920201,Christopheraaron,2015-06-16 02:13:00,3525,"So I've heard, what I wanted to do is salt for the summer and then switch over to other baits closer to opener."

920329,Mister G,2015-06-16 21:45:00,1429,And they say selling wildlife meat is illegal (unless the government does it).
920338,Big Cliff,2015-06-16 22:30:00,6899,"Don't know, maybe different in different areas? All I know is that's what he told me it was and that is what I paid him."
920351,FloatnFly,2015-06-16 23:41:00,1640,"And they say selling wildlife meat is illegal (unless the government does it).   Its illegal for retail merchants to sell it, unless it has been farm raised and is identifiable as being farm raised, for instance, we sell, bison, elk, ostrich, camel, kangaroo, and a red deer cross.  im not sure on private sales, but i think unless you're native, its illegal"
920579,BillM,2015-06-18 12:00:00,17367,"Yeah you can't set up a road side stand and sell the deer you shot 3 weeks ago, lol.  Can't wait for the fall!  My buddies farm has some giants!"
