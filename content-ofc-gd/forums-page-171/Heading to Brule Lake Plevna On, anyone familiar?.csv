919816,fishindevil,2015-06-13 08:41:00,6254,I have fished the lake for lake trout but it was a lot earlier in the season !!! Very clear water deep and cold typical northern small trout lake with a well defined thermocline it was around 25ft down in August it will be deeper for sure 30-40ft down  are you jigging ? Using riggers or leadcore ????

I'm not bringing my StarCraft 190, I will be first mate this time and relax a bit. Thanks all, and for the PM's as well."
