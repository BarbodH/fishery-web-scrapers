919677,LeXXington,2015-06-12 14:18:00,1928,I use the Engine but also have a grab handle to help me up.  With the kids and wife I use a portable ladder.  hardest part was training the dog to use the ladder
919680,MrSimon,2015-06-12 14:42:00,217,"This got me thinking about my pontoon boat.  It doesn't have a ladder and there is no way someone could climb up and over the side of a round pontoon and through one of the gates.  The only real option is from the back, using the motor or climbing up the back of a pontoon.  I think I'll be buying a boarding ladder for the front of the boat ASAP.  I think they make them that fold up under the front deck between the pontoons ... something that can be pulled down from the water."
919681,G.mech,2015-06-12 14:50:00,830,From Transport Canada:   You can use a rope with knots tied in it to meet the regulation or a hanging rope strung between two cleats although they may not be that practical if you actually have to use them.  The outboard works but does not meet the requirements. The cops were giving out tickets on L. Ontario last year for this so make sure you have some plan.  The measurement location is not defined and remains the usual grey area....

Seems like a lot of folks  depend on the motor as a means of getting back into their boat but if it's not a legal option their could be plenty of tickets being issued if the police decide to enforce it.
919684,Cast-Away,2015-06-12 15:04:00,790,"Hey Lew, where did you get that boarding ladder?"
919686,lew,2015-06-12 15:14:00,12766,"Hey Lew, where did you get that boarding ladder?  It's called a E ladder and my boat came with it already installed from the factory (Skeeter) and I honestly don't know where you could buy them although I'm sure you could find a dealer thru GOOGLE.  It's a pretty slick deal though and very easy to deploy & use.  https://www.google.ca/search?q=e+ladder+for+boats&biw=1069&bih=542&tbm=isch&tbo=u&source=univ&sa=X&ved=0CDIQsARqFQoTCJXO_YW4isYCFQ0NkgodZHQA8g"
919689,Old Man,2015-06-12 15:37:00,822,I have one just like this on my Crestliner Fishhawk. Works great.  Telescoping ladder folds and unfold easily. We use it all the time when we go for a swim. 
919696,lookinforwalleye,2015-06-12 16:21:00,4399,I have one that came  attached to the Stratos.....can`t see me hauling my fat out of shape arse out of the water with that ladder....a power winch of some kind would be better....or loose 50 pounds!!!

919874,G.mech,2015-06-13 20:37:00,830,"These are really cool.  They fold and slide into a 3"" diameter tube through the transom so they are completely out of the way.  Not cheap but really a neat desigh:  http://garelick.com/Compact-Eez-In-II-Transom-Ladder"

Also practice getting up on the electric when deployed and using talon and cavitation plate. Everyone should try boarding there boat from the water to be prepared

919522,lew,2015-06-11 12:36:00,12766,Just thinking about the boater that fell out of his boat on Lake O the other day and drowned.  I've got a drop down ladder on the back of my boat that I could use to climb back in...hopefully...in the event I fall overboard.  What's everybody else using ??  Just curious if everyone has thought about it because it could happen to any one of us on the next trip.  Here's my ladder on the right side of the motor.  
919523,Gallie,2015-06-11 12:38:00,1215,"I have a small boarding ladder built into the back of my 20 footer, nothing on the 12 ft tinny."
919529,AKRISONER,2015-06-11 12:46:00,5558,"id like to point out that boarding ladders are not easy to board from, as a wakeboarder, im 27 and work out all the time and even i find boarding from a boarding ladder difficult. For the old timers and those of us who are slightly lazier, i wouldnt count on a boarding ladder to bail you out."
919530,Roy,2015-06-11 12:48:00,13728,"It is required by law if your freeboard (distance needed to climb vertically from the water surface to the edge of the vessel) is more than 20""  Whether required or not,it would be useful for almost any boat provided of course your motor was stopped hen you fell out OR you were wearing you kill switch tether."
919544,bow slayer,2015-06-11 13:59:00,1074,"I have one mounted on the back of my 16 footer,it is great for when the kids are tubing or just jumping off for a swim,though as mentioned it is not the easiest to climb out with."
919546,NAW,2015-06-11 14:01:00,4022,"I have a rope ladder I bring if I've got the kiddies, and we plan on swimming / jumping from the boat."
919547,KLINKER,2015-06-11 14:15:00,256,"I run the dock lines the length of the boat for grab lines, the boarding ladder is stowed out of the way. I recall one of the squadron members  tossed his OL'Lady over the side for a man overboard practice and they couldn't get her back in the boat. She was not happy."
919551,Fang,2015-06-11 14:48:00,1330,We've always stepped on the cavitation plate as the motors usually in the down position. We stop for swims and snorkeling a lot up north and even I can haul my big carcass back in the boat this way. I can always reach up on the motor and drop the trim down if it's still up to high from being on plane.  Kind of hard on the knees getting over the transom but it works
919552,lew,2015-06-11 15:02:00,12766,"id like to point out that boarding ladders are not easy to board from, as a wakeboarder, im 27 and work out all the time and even i find boarding from a boarding ladder difficult.

Granted their not all that easy to use but their a heck of a lot better than no ladder at all."
919553,DRIFTER_016,2015-06-11 15:02:00,10439,"Nope, don't need one on my boat. The cavitation plate is perfect for getting back in. Seems lit it would be on your boat as well. That's how I get back in when going for a swim to cool off out in the lake."
919554,Rich Clemens,2015-06-11 15:04:00,3131,"Interesting thread.  We have none, but a number of years back, one of our dogs fell out of the boat and I had to go in after her.  She was a lousy swimmer and the water was a bit rough.  Yes, my life jacket was on when I went in.        After lifting her back in, I also used the engine to get myself back in.   Not the best idea, but was my only option.   Might be a good idea to pick something up that we could just hang over the back when we need it."
919559,doubleheader,2015-06-11 15:42:00,497,I have a boarding ladder. I was talking to a guy yesterday. A number of years ago him and a friend required rescuing from a local lake. They were both wearing life jackets. By the time they were picked up the cold water had zapped their strength to the point that they could not even climb the ladder. They were probably minutes from being in a very serious situation.
919560,irishfield,2015-06-11 15:47:00,26272,Cavitation plates great if the motor's not running!  
919561,Sinker,2015-06-11 15:51:00,8692,"Falling out of a boat while trolling alone is a real bad situation. If your not wearing your PFD, your in big trouble.  Getting back into a moving boat isn't going to happen.  Getting back into a stopped boat is a workout in itself. I don't have a ladder, I use the motor as well, but my boat isn't that high.....I'll have to measure, I may be over 20"".....  S."

919594,kickingfrog,2015-06-11 20:26:00,8333,Familiar with the hight requirement for the need of a boarding ladder but I've never seen anything saying where this would be measured. Is it just the lowest point?
919599,Old Ironmaker,2015-06-11 21:02:00,8243,I recently looked at the regs for a boarding ladder. It is measured from the waters surface to the top of the gunnel. The question is exactly where. I think it was the rear forward of the transom. I have a boarding ladder and it isn't the easiest thing to climb. I wear a hydrostatic inflatable.
919600,Roy,2015-06-11 21:04:00,13728,"Rob, they measure it from water surface to top edge of transom......you probably don't have much more than half the requirement....9-10 inches."
919602,kickingfrog,2015-06-11 21:13:00,8333,"I figured I was ok by a good margin, just wasn't sure where the measurement was from."
919603,SuperDave,2015-06-11 21:16:00,204,I have one purchased it with the boat. Seems kind of flimsy but better than nothing.
919621,musky666,2015-06-11 23:56:00,126,"Came with the boat, not sure I would have ordered it if I had a choice- and hope I never need to use it in an emergency... "
919675,grimsbylander,2015-06-12 13:48:00,3016,"Climbing into any boat in the summertime while swimming is night and day to the very same boat in cold water while wearing a coat, sweater, jeans and boots. Plan for the October/November/March/April dunking, not August."
919676,Mister G,2015-06-12 13:52:00,1429,My new 2015 PolarKraft Frontier came with a small bracket/step used to board on the starboard side of the transom. It folds down and snaps into place very easily then flips up when not in use and it's made of METAL ! ! ! I think all new boats should have one.
