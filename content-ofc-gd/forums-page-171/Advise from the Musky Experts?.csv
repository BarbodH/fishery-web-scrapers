919852,KraTToR,2015-06-13 16:22:00,506,"Very very true...  Your getting them to strike which is more then some other anglers can say...  Im sure the rest will sort itself out because you sound like you'll rack your brain until you figure it out...  I used to lose fish and choke on follows ALL THE TIME... But year after year I got better and now my opportunity to success ratio has improved a lot...  Another thing I do is use 50lb mono for trolling... I literally cannot remember ever losing a fish on that rod... And I troll a lot... I run braid and mono and I lose some fish on the braid rod but the mono rod keeps em hooked up better... It also helps keep your baits up higher... Gives you some options to play with... Thanks Lew, that's a great idea... As my trolling rod has plenty of action (bend) I'll swap out the braid for mono on the next trip.  You say you use 50lb. What brand? Big Game? XT?  Thanks!"
919853,shimano19,2015-06-13 16:23:00,196,"I prefer to keep the drag locked, you don't want any of that pulling when you set the hook on a muskie 50-70ft out. If the fish starts going crazy boat side I freespool and use my thumb just to give her a bit of give."
919854,shimano19,2015-06-13 16:26:00,196,"And again, keep those hooks sharp!!"
919861,mike rousseau,2015-06-13 18:36:00,4661,Big game  1/4 pound spool is like $10
919862,SuperDave,2015-06-13 18:53:00,204,"With muskie, you win some, you lose some. Sometimes you think a fish is well hooked and it is just holding the lure in its mouth. Sharp hooks for sure. I would be careful about re-setting the hook if you're not too sure. I did that and pulled the lure free. Keep fishing for them and have fun!"
919876,Dontcryformejanhrdina,2015-06-13 20:53:00,535,"I'm by no way an ""expert"". I've lost many, many musky. Some by no fault of my own, some because of amatuer mistakes I made. Looking back at all the catches and lost fish I've learned one thing for sure: every fish is different. Some fish have required 2-3 hook sets. Others I could just tell were barely hooked and the initial hook set was enough and when they ended up in the net, a thin piece of skin was all that was holding them on. Another hook set would have easily torn that free.  Try not to get too discouraged. There's going to be lost fish. It happens to everyone. You'll get better with experience. I'm still learning things with every success and failure. Not every hit is equal. Some hit square and hard and a good hard hook set will get some hooks into that fish. Some barely grab the bait and might get a single hook in it's nose and need to be coaxed in more. Then there's the blowups. Every musky angler has seen a fish just explode out of the water behind the bait and never even make contact with it. It's not always the angler's fault when you lose a fish. Just getting them to bite is half the battle. Keep plugging away and you'll get a feel for each fish, don't get discouraged too much."
919945,KraTToR,2015-06-14 14:48:00,506,"Thanks for everyone's input!  Some great advise here and a lot to think about.  I'm usually diligent with hook sharpness, something from my steelheading days but I've already started going through my baits just to be sure.  A little story on my very first intentional interaction with a musky.. Again it was a Super Shad Rap.. It followed the bait right up to the boat and hit it broad-side with his snout. I guess they do this to ""stun"" the bait for an easier grab.. Well I was so excited with actually seeing one of these beasts that I didn't even think to figure 8...  Another one that haunts me..lol"
919946,KraTToR,2015-06-14 14:52:00,506,"Sorry about that Patrick, I absolutely remember meeting you that day but a I have met up with so many OFC members over the past few months that my brain fails from time to time! Nothing wrong with those setups, a super shad rap on that MH rod is fine as far as hooksetting goes. I prefer a minimum of 80lb test myself. Like others have said, we all lose muskies - it's just a part of the game. On my LOTW trip last year on day 2, I hooked and lost two 50+ fish in 15 minutes and was heartbroken. The next morning at our first spot I nailed a 48.5"" and at the second spot a 51"". Don't read too much into lost fish - and the fact that you are contacting fish is half the battle! Keep those hooks sharp, and remember that hooksets (and second hooksets) are free  Cheers Pete And that anchor works great!  I've never fished LOTW - the fresh water fisherman's holy grail.  And to lose 2 monsters back to back... I can't even begin to feel your pain.  Sounds like it ended well tho.."
919959,Fisherpete,2015-06-14 16:42:00,1814,"Scott and James - I'll try take some pics of my hook sharpening method later - I use the same Luhr Jensen file that Andrew mentioned, it's the best we have found (and we have tried a lot of different files). I basically sharpen each point on 3 sides, front (outside) and 2 sides. I don't sharpen all the way down to the barb, my focus is on making a super sharp cutting point area.    One more hook sharpening tip - don't think that hooks are sharp on a lure because it is new - often they are dull as heck or even have bent points right out of the package!  Patrick - muskies do 'bump' lures all the time with mouth closed - like you said, to stun or if they are a smart fish maybe test the waters lol... had a day on Pigeon last year when that happened a half dozen times in the morning... I went back to those same fish in the evening and caught 4 of them!  Pete"

Very often while cranking in your bait you'll feel a bump or even the line go slack for a second. I guess their trying to figure out what it is but just keep cranking and more times than not they'll grab it within a second or two.  Always nice when they broadcast their about to hit your bait LOL"
919990,Rizzo,2015-06-14 18:28:00,4754,What flavour supershad rap you using? We  had success on perch flavour and firetiger
920002,KraTToR,2015-06-14 20:08:00,506,"It was strawberry...lol  I have perch as well and did get some strikes on the perch Jake.  The rap I was using is what Rapala calls the Original Pearl Shad and it comes with galvanized hooks (SW?) which are in the process of getting swapped out.   As they usually come from below, the orange belly stripe may be the trigger.  Rapala also have a new ""Walleye"" pattern that I've heard gets good results on LSC."
920006,Tom McCutcheon,2015-06-14 20:27:00,627,"George Unis (outlaw) has been making baits for quite some time that work well on LSC as does Mike Parker and his Handlebarz baits.  Not saying to switch up on what seems to work for you, but a muskie guy can never have enough baits. It comes with the lighter wallet....and extra tackle storage cabinets etc. etc."
920031,lew,2015-06-14 21:54:00,12766,"but a muskie guy can never have enough baits.  I just sold off 43 baits that hardly ever got used anymore Tom, my boats gonna be riding alot higher in the water this season. LOL"

919704,KraTToR,2015-06-12 17:03:00,506,"Its well known that there are several very successful Musky fisherman on this forum, can you please help out a newbie!!  What's your style for reeling in the fish once it's on? crank it in hard so It cant put up a fight or play it so it doesn't go nuts boat-side?  I have all the right gear but i'm wondering if the fish is ripping the bait out of its mouth because the rods are so stiff and the lack of stretch in the braid..I lost a fish of a lifetime yesterday and 2 others when they were 1/2 way to the boatI really need to start increasing my landing success... Thanks in Advance."
919705,Raf,2015-06-12 17:10:00,3495,super sharp hooks are key #1.  sharpen anything out of the box and retouch anything if it feels in the least bit dull.  i lock my drag down for the hookset but will back it off a bit once the fish is on.  if the fish wants to run I let it and control it with my thumb if needed.  they don't make long runs but they are strong so i think a little 'give' is good especially as you get closer to the boat.  going 0/3 leads me to believe key #1 was the culprit not your drag setting.
919710,mike rousseau,2015-06-12 17:18:00,4661,"It's not always so black and white  My gear is heavy duty and drags pretty much locked... But the 49"" fish I hooked boatside Saturday only got one of the points on the back treble of my bucktail...  Once I realized this I had to free spool and attempt to get another hook into her...  I wasn't successful getting a second hook in so I had to take it easy and make wide smooth motions with my rod to get her into the net...    I'm sure most musky guys have LOADS of stories about failures... The good musky guys learn from the failures and grow from them...   But losing fish that far out in your retrieve I'd say sharpen your hooks..."
919711,lew,2015-06-12 17:22:00,12766,"I'm gonna agree with Raf and let the fish have room to run a bit if required, specially for bigger fish.  If you keep everything locked up solid something gonna let go and it could very well be the hooks ripping free from her mouth.  Pretty helpless feeling when everything goes slack and that big girl is waving ""bye bye"""
919722,Gregoire,2015-06-12 18:18:00,1397,"As was previously said, sharpen hooks: all the way to the barb. In order to get a good hook set the hook must enter past the barb. They probably got off because the hooks were not set properly, so if your hooks sharp, make sure you set the hook, sometimes multiple times, especially if you are using rubber. After a while you should be able to get a feeling of whether you made a good hook set or not. Set the hook hard, and I mean as hard as you can. A musky's mouth is all teeth and bone. I have seen people literally jump off the ground, and run to the back of the boat on a hook set. When I am fishing with someone I can generally tell if they set the hook or not. Once you have a good hook set you should be able to horse them in, which is a my preferred method. Get them in the bag as quickly as possible. It is much better for the fish. The net acts as a livewell.  I hate it when people say you have to play the fish. I have heard people say that they don't want the fish thrashing in the net, but that is why you have bolt cutters and other release tools. Cut the split rings, cut the tips off of hooks. With this done it becomes easy to unwrap the fish and allow it to revive in the net. I would recommend a pair of Lindy fish handling gloves, they literally allow you to lip a musky without getting cut, ask Fisherpete. Get in there with the gloves and cut away until the fish is loose."
919727,Rich Clemens,2015-06-12 18:35:00,3131,"Sounds right here as well.  I've lost a fish or two due to not having a good hook set.  Either that was my own fault on the hook-set or the hooks were not sharp enough for proper penetration.  I keep my drag tight, but ust loose enough should the fish want to take a run.  Always try to keep the line tight and not give any slack line.   Some good reminders as I prepare for my opener this week-end up north."

919740,Tom McCutcheon,2015-06-12 19:43:00,627,"As others have said,  SHARP HOOKS    I do not tighten my drag all the way down, but control the runs with my thumb pressure which is always on the spool during the retrieve and for the hook set."
919748,landry,2015-06-12 20:16:00,1005,Lock the drag down. Sharpen hooks. Fight them hard. Some days or weeks u land them all sometimes they all get off. It's frustrating how they can shake a mouthful of trebles sometimes

919754,Big Cliff,2015-06-12 21:00:00,6899,"IMHO keep the fish on the line and as long as you do that, you will land it! Sounds simple but it isn't always! You have to keep the line tight enough that the fish can't spit the hook out but loose enough that you don't rip it out.  Remember that a fish with your hook in it's mouth is your fish until you do something to remove the hook! Light but steady pressure, no slack line, keep the rod tip high and be ready to drop it quickly.  BTW, I am no expert! X usually = an unknown and a spurt is just a drip under pressure!"

919781,KraTToR,2015-06-12 23:37:00,506,"Thanks to everyone.. After reading the feedback and talking to my fishing buddy, I've concluded that with the no stretch line and pool cue rods we were just too aggressive.  I've done a ton of drift fishing using 6lb mono on a 13' pole, landing 35lb salmon.. Lots of line stretch and lots of give to the rod.  I have to start relying a lot more on my drag of course, learning!  Being only 2.5 hours away from Belle River, I'll be giving it another go in a few weeks.. with sharpened hooks and a whole new plan.  Cheers!"
919785,Moosebunk,2015-06-13 00:27:00,3970,"Any better musky anglers than myself, whom have shared time on the water, if trolling, are ""two-hand drag"" guys.  They're also hook-sharpening freaks.  The reason is because that's what works best most, but, nothing you do will be 100%, all of it needs to be considered and adaptable to any and all variables, and end of the day what will put more fish in the boat IMO is experience, confidence and knowledge.  You lost some fish this time, you'll only learn from that and do better next time."
