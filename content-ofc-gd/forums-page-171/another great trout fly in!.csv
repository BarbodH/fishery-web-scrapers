920294,adempsey,2015-06-16 19:48:00,1498,Some nice fish there!  Perfect eating size too.   Did you fly into Trout (Dayohessarah) Lake?

920298,Joeytier,2015-06-16 20:00:00,3990,Use photobucket instead of trying to post photos directly to the board.  Looks like an awesome trip!

920333,chris.brock,2015-06-16 22:12:00,4053,Sounds like a great trip. I wouldn't have guessed a lake like that could produce 20 pound fish. Very cool.
920335,manitoubass2,2015-06-16 22:17:00,11391,That one is a TANK!!!!  nice haul!

920543,123chadder,2015-06-18 01:40:00,165,"that was caught the week after us by a close buddy...he was jigging and had the stick pulled out of his hand....they were trolling in the area a couple hours later they saw the stick....fish was still on,it turned out to be 27 pounds!"
