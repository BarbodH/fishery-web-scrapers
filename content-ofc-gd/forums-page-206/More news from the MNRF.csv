This will prove to be a very bad decision, I'll bet;  The Ministry of Natural Resources will not recall 30 seasonal firefighting staff who work out of Sault Ste. Marie. MPP David Orazietti said the local cuts will not affect the capabilities of the MNR to fight fires. “What I can say is they are expecting to maintain a similar complement in terms of total number of jobs in the organization during next year’s fire season,” said Orazietti. Those seasonal jobs just won’t be filled in Sault Ste. Marie. A statement from the office of Natural Resources Minister Bill Mauro reads: “Thirty seasonal staff are receiving notice that they will not be recalled to their current positions.  Sault Ste. Marie will continue to have 350 full-time staff – more than any other community except Peterborough, where MNRF has its headquarters. These changes will not affect our ability to protect Sault Ste. Marie or surrounding communities. MNRF operates all fire facilities as a network that responds to fires wherever they occur.” Read More Here: http://www.sootoday.com/content/news/details.asp?c=81407 "

We had a slack year this summer for Ontario fires... only saw the helicopters go into our Temagami air base three times this summer, when usually there is a constant 2 or 3 almost daily. Never saw the MNR turbo Beaver this summer either out burning kerosene."
881505,John Bacon,2014-11-18 22:08:00,3277, MPP David Orazietti said the local cuts will not affect the capabilities of the MNR to fight fires.   So what purpose did they serve then?  If cutting them won't affect firefighting ability then that indicate that they were not helpful in fighting fires.  If they were of any help in fighting fires then their absence will affect fire fighting abilities.

881519,Rod Caster,2014-11-18 22:28:00,5784,We've had a few very wet seasons in Northern Ontario. No reason for that many guys on the team if they aren't being fully utilized. They are seasonal workers and the number of guys hired changes year to year.  This is my understanding.

No offence to anyone that swims in the gravy bowl that is civil service but I will watch with great interest to see the reaction when faced with the cold hard facts and a reality most of us in the real world share. Might do well to claw...... er, tear back some pensions while they're at it. That would be the first time in a decade the Lieberals would be seeing clearly into the future. Union militants unite!!!! LMAO!!!!"

881561,Rod Caster,2014-11-19 00:41:00,5784,"The current feds added a bunch more MP positions... not provincial, so a bit off topic.  Either way, I know a few guys who do/did the MNR fire-fighting jobs; they work super-hard all summer and fish super-hard all winter haha."
