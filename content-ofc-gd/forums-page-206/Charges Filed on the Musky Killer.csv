881635,manitoubass2,2014-11-19 06:07:00,11391,"what the hell took them so long? lack of evidence? public pressure?  anyhow,good news. it was obvious he bonked that fish  too bad they couldnt charge him for his other stupid statements about killing everyone he catches."
881647,Handlebarz,2014-11-19 10:30:00,3790,They have been on the case hard from day 1.  The MNR can not release details until they actually finish the investigation and file the charges.
881653,outllaw,2014-11-19 11:41:00,1232,the way the charges read. I would be surprised to see a fine over 200.00 dollars.
881655,Acountdeleted,2014-11-19 11:51:00,2562,Yeah. He has to pay $2 more to renew his fishing licence as his fine.
881707,mpt,2014-11-19 17:35:00,158,Yeah. He has to pay $2 more to renew his fishing licence as his fine. Coffee on my monitor now.
