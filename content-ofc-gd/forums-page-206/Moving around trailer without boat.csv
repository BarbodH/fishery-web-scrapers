880609,ch312,2014-11-13 19:32:00,1590,No need for any markers or flags on the trailer. If you can't see it in either side mirror then it's going straight. Turn left or right as needed.   Don't try to use different driving techniques when reversing a trailer and stick to how you normally drive as it'll be more natural feeling and be much easier in the long run.
880610,BillM,2014-11-13 19:56:00,17367,"One thing my oldman taught me when I first started to pull the boat, always use the mirrors.   Once you do that, it's gravy."
880611,Old Ironmaker,2014-11-13 20:33:00,8243,"I'm dislesic, can't spell is part of it. I sure had one heck of a time learning. I would hook up anything I could tow on night shift at the plant. The mechanical gang had to go hunting for the welding machines in the mornings. Like I said and others as well, if you can't see the trailer the thing is straight. The more you practice the luckier you get. Turn the wheel left the trailer goes right, turn right it goes left. Saying it out load might help, and no need for speed, slow wins the race."
880636,Big Cliff,2014-11-13 22:29:00,6899,Learn to use your mirrors! I can't even back up a trailer without them anymore (well I can but it isn't pretty)

Or he just dosent want you taking off with the boat, once he drops you in.  Theres also that time when I had to back in between two fellas that were taking their sweet time. In out in 2 minutes."
880652,Mister G,2014-11-13 23:50:00,1429,"Using your mirrors is fine, but saying if you can't see your trailer you're going straight back doesn't cut it when you're backing down a steep ramp and the trailer disappears and now you don't know if you're going to hit the dock you can't see or the front of your truck might hit a wall as you make adjustment."
880656,irishfield,2014-11-13 23:54:00,26272,Why I said to turn your mirrors down until you can see your back tire... accounts for the ramp slope!

880666,lew,2014-11-14 00:27:00,12766,"Sorry boys, but you fellas are waaaay over thinking this.  With a bit of practice, backing up a trailer is darned near as easy as going forward and nowhere near as difficult as some of you are making it out to be.  Go to an empty parking lot early on a Sunday morning and spend a bit of time practicing a few different turns in reverse and you'll be a master in no time."
880667,BillM,2014-11-14 00:29:00,17367,"I sorry you don't understand.  You're right, I don't understand how you smash the front of your truck into a retaining wall while backing your boat down the launch ramp.   Care to explain?  Also., if you've got your mirrors setup properly like Wayne suggested it doesn't matter how steep the ramp is, you'll ALWAYS be able to see the trailer if you start going off to one side or the other."

I will admit that when I'm backing my boat into it's shelter I lift the rear hatch on my Pilot. I can back into the shelter with the mirrors but do a better job of getting it centered looking through the back. My shelter is 10'X40' and there is a foot or less on either side if I get it perfectly centered. I like it centered so I can get to the back of the boat from either side. Even so it's a bit tight.  My snowmobile trailer is short and suffers from short trailer syndrome."

Slow and go..I hate not seeing my trailer but if I know the launch and ramp its ok. Another tip is if your towing with a pickup simply put the tailgate down, then you will see the trailer"

If the truck and trailer are going straight in line before entering the water they'll continue in a straight line until you turn the wheel or the trailer floats for some reason.    x 2 on turning the mirrors down. I always have my mirrors aimed lower than most as it aids in reversing and fitting into tight spots everywhere. I also think that every vehicle should have those dome mirrors stuck to the main side mirrors as they offer a much better view and eliminate blind spots."

The amount of trouble depends on the launch so I'm just wondering if anyone has any tips/tricks for dealing with this? I'm thinking maybe I can rig something up with some pvc or something so I have some sort of guides, but I'm not entirely sure. Anyone else had/have this problem?"
880424,John Bacon,2014-11-12 03:46:00,3277,You can buy poles that fasten to the side of the trailer.  They are designed to guide the boat on to the trailer; but they may also solve your problem of not being able to see the trailer.  This is what I am referring to.  http://www.basspro.com/Bass-Pro-Shops-Heavy-Duty-Post-Style-Boat-Guide-Ons/product/10208433/?cmCat=
880425,irishfield,2014-11-12 03:59:00,26272,Put those electric mirrors to work and tip them both so you can see the ground @ about the rear wheel of the truck. More chance you'll see your trailer fenders that way after it heads down the ramp.
880426,Wagoneer,2014-11-12 04:04:00,118,"The easiest thing would be to buy some convex mirrors for your side mirrors. Have you tried backing up with your tailgate/trunk open? I'm not sure what kind of vehicle you have, but with our grand vitara I always open the tailgate and have the seats folded down. This pretty much gives me the view of the entire trailer behind the car. We have a reverse camera for that truck that also works perfectly. But I like having the trunk open so I can communicate with my dad who's in the boat. But If you tow with anything other than a SUV/hatchback I guess that's not an option.  Guide poles always work as well."
880427,manitoubass2,2014-11-12 04:34:00,11391,maybe im being silly but what is there to line up?  i always back the trailer into the water then run the boat up. i keep it in the water when hooking it up. i can easily adjust the boat to be even. then pull out. should be even easier with a 16 foot boat.

880455,manitoubass2,2014-11-12 15:46:00,11391,we have some gnarly backlake launches around here. they often require odd turning or big hills or pot holes to avoid. one thing that makes backing up a trailor waaay easier is using your hand at the bottom of the steering wheel. this way the trailor will turn which ever way you turn the wheel.  i know that doesnt help with visibility. just thought id throw it in here.  sounds like guides are the way to go for you

880458,steelhunter,2014-11-12 17:05:00,81,I had the same problem as you. I have a backup camera doesn't really help cause you can't move the camera where you need it remotely. Even with someone helping you backup still a pain. I bought the guide poles for my trailer this summer best thing I ever bought no problems backing up at all now you just use the poles as your guide plus it helps keep the boat straight on the trailer.
880484,aplumma,2014-11-12 22:38:00,6896,you can get a bicycle flag and put the bracket on the trailer. Just put the flag in place when you are backing down after you get finish just pull the flag. You will not have to get guide ons if you don't need them and it is a 10 dollar solution.   Art

I should show you the maneuver I use to get the boat around the garage and past the tree up on the lawn and not hit the fence on one side or the deck on the other,  for winter storage.  No smoke, all mirrors.  You never know who's trailer (or what kind of a trailer -boat, sled, camper) you maybe backing up or parking down the road.  I firmly believe one should know how to use your mirrors.  Not every vehicle/trailer will have poles or a backup camera and it's the best way to learn imo."
