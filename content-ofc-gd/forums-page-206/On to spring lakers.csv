880278,chris.brock,2014-11-11 01:38:00,4053,I don't think there's much between Muskoka and N Bay. Temagami doesn't open until May 2_4 if you went further. Muskoka or Haliburton are closer with lots of options.
880342,Consigliere,2014-11-11 15:44:00,121,Not quite in Quinte but the lake shoals out from the reach and on the south side of Amherst have huge lakers and plenty of them March and April.  Some great action out there and easy to have a big average size.
880350,jimmer,2014-11-11 18:26:00,2730,Try launching in Port Hope and trolling the shore east of there. Great spring action the last time I tried it. I think I fished it the walleye opener on Quinte.
880392,dwc67,2014-11-11 23:19:00,140,"south shore of lake o around the welland canal or the niagara bar. we were hitting lakers shallow this past april, i got this in 8ft  "
880419,KraTToR,2014-11-12 03:04:00,506,That's what I mean about this forum.  The quality!  Something about Jimmer's comment about Port Hope struck a cord with me.  Back in the late '90s I used to fish the mouth of the Ganney in the fall and we used to catch Lakers moving up the river.  For sure there's going to be some big girls out front in the spring.  Thank you
880516,wall i,2014-11-13 05:00:00,48,"Trout Lake near Noelville, After ice out find the flats in under 15 FOW preferably with a stream feed. Tie on a J-13 Rap and enjoy.  Several years ago I picked up a 22 lbs there and had one on for 30min which I could not winch off the bottom. Save for some massive air bubbles it released, I never got a glimpse of it. Likely the largest fish Ive ever had on and that includes other LT's and kings at over 35 lbs. I recall I went thru 3 cigarettes with that beast sitting directly on bottom 10' below the boat and I could not move him an inch. Eventually the hooks worked themselves free and the rap floated to the top. Have always wanted to go back but moved out west and LOTW aint too shabby and under 2 hrs away."
