881314,DRIFTER_016,2014-11-17 22:05:00,10439,Seems things have been getting hard around here since last I went to the lake 2 weeks ago. Guess I had better get out sooner rather than later if I want some early ice fish.

881345,Canuck2fan,2014-11-18 00:12:00,1444, Complaining that I haven't been out yet.  LOL it is earlier than usual up there for ice? I am worried here that it will freeze before I get out steelheading a couple more times...
