881051,huzzsaba,2014-11-16 16:32:00,884,"Back when I was younger and crazier lol , and didn't have a phone or any type of roadside assistance,  I changed a tire on a older company van (GMC 12 passenger van) on the left shoulder of the 401.  If I remember correctly, it was somewhere in Scarborough and it wasn't fun.  To make matters more interesting, the spare tire ended up being flat as well .  I now have CAA membership , so I would probably call them up if I was stuck on a busy highway.  Other small highways, or roads, I would do it myself and save a call.    "
881088,moxie,2014-11-16 19:03:00,1566,Never had to change a tire at the side of the road(knock on wood). I swap my own tires when the seasons change so it isnt a big deal but also have a CAA membership if and when it happens or if i forget to bring my motivation along.
881116,motv8tr,2014-11-16 21:23:00,2587,"I can and have, and yes even on the 400, helped others on the highway change theirs.  Wrote a post on facebook suggesting how one might make sure the spare under the vehicle could be maintained to make it easy to get off when needed.  I keep a kit in my car of various tools and such and change it out for the winter. What I don't have is a torque wrench, on my list of things to get.  Maureen"
881234,ch312,2014-11-17 14:46:00,1590,Some of you think it's crazy that some people don't know how to change a tire. What really boggles my mind is the huge number of people who have no clue they could prevent most flats by having their tires properly inflated and inspecting them for damage regularly.   Preventative maintenance for the win!

Problem was the trunk was full of crap, crap I ask her months ago to deal with...  So here I am on the 401 in Belleville emptying out her trunk on the side of the 401 so I can access the spare and jack etc... I won't lie it was a little nerve racking changing that tire with crap on the side of the road, the car up on a jack and non stop transports flying by.. Not something I wish to experience again.  G"
881277,LostAnotherOne,2014-11-17 19:27:00,956,If I get a flat tire on the highway I'm probably calling CAA.  Its just too dangerous.  So much talk about police having a dangerous job.  Forget that a tow truck driver should be the ones getting 100k a year.

880784,irishfield,2014-11-14 18:30:00,26272,"All 3 kids.. never got the keys to a vehicle solo until they had taken the change a flat ""school"". It was determined at that time 2 of them might have to show a bit of leg.. hell maybe even the son.. to find someone strong enough to get the nuts off, but at least they knew where the jack was... how to get the spare down from under the truck, etc.  Personally, in 37 or so years of driving I've never had a flat on the side of the road, vehicle or trailer. Stay away from the curb and the garbage it contains and most of your troubles don't happen. That and checking inflation of tires on a regular basis. That's not to say that there has been numerous occasions of family members making it home with nails and screws in tires, that I generally take care of still on the vehicle."
880786,jimmer,2014-11-14 18:34:00,2730,"I can usually do this, but as I was changing over to my winter tires/rims and one stupid nut would not come off. I was using an electric impact gun then switched to short breaker bars. I ended up breaking two breaker bars and that was after heating the nut up. Had to buy a longer breaker bar and then I finally got it off. Used a torque wrench to put it back on. I have pulled over to help someone in the past and couldn't even budge the nuts without rolling the whole car. Told her to call for help after that, but made sure she got a hold of someone. I had an 1988 Jeep Comanche pick up years ago and the wheels would actually seize to the drums on the rear. I could actually drive around and they still wouldn't let go. I think every vehicle can be different, but always good to be prepared for the worst. Only had to do it once on the side of the road for myself and had no problem. I'm amazed that it doesn't happen more often."

Only once have I had to do my own tire and that was because a brand new Michelin was defective and blew out. All the rest were with buddiees over the years or at Cayuga changing out slicks for street tires back in our 5.0l fever days.

However to behonest I think I have only had one flat in the past 10 years and even that was a slow leak with a nail in the side wall (thanks to our local land fill insisting I had to take weeds up to the dumping face) and I just went to our local Nissan dealer. Only cost me $300.00!

Going to work Nov 5 at 6am on the 401 just past Keele I hit a tire that came off another carand was laying flat on the ground, I made it to the Dufferin overpass and behind me was the car with no tire parked! he came over and told me it was his and told me it just had the tires changed! I got out to see what the damage was (driver side) next thing I notice cars were coming very, very close so they could take a look! See Yah! never again on a highway.  CAA has it covered if need be. Funny thing when I get home I get a phone call from my brother wondering if that was me! The car I drove had a very distinct colour  Something they called Teal  back then."
880718,lew,2014-11-14 11:36:00,12766,"Couple posts lately about tires got me thinking about something.  I was driving down hwy 28 a couple weeks back when the dashboard lit up telling me I had a soft tire. I pulled over for a look and sure enough the back right was low with a 2"" wood screw in the tread. I went down the road 1/2 a mile to a donut shop at 28 & 7 and parked around back and changed the tire.  My current vehicle is an F-150 with 20"" wheels so their heavy and awkward but not really that big of a deal to change. I change them twice a year for the winter tires anyway so I'm used to doing it and have for as many years as I can remember.  I carry an old sweater and gloves to keep somewhat clean while on the road plus a tarp to kneel on. I lubricate the mechanism holding the tire under the truck twice a year to make sure it always works properly plus check the spare tire pressure.  I also keep the jack lubricated, plus carry a power bar if a lug is too tight and even some short pieces of 2 x 4 to put under the jack if the ground is soft.  I do most of my driving on country roads and don't want to be stranded in the middle of nowhere because of something as simple as a flat tire. This was my 1st flat in 15 years but it was good to know I was prepared.  I mentioned to a friend that I'd changed the tire and he was amazed. Said he's never done it and wouldn't even know how,  and doesn't even know where his spare tire or jack  is. If he gets a flat, he calls a tow truck to change it for him.  Twice now in the last couple weeks I've seen guys parked on the side of the road with flats and just sitting in their cars as if they were waiting for help.  Just curious, can you change a tire on your vehicle on the side of the road, or do you need to call for help ??"

880727,Bernie,2014-11-14 12:59:00,3190,"Good topic Lew. I'd bet a large percentage couldn't get their spare out of the storage if they are under the vehicle.The mechanisms tend to seize, mostly due to salt and dirt getting into it.You are wise to lubricate it. Also it is important to get the torque on the wheel nuts close to where it is called for. Too tight can damage the stud, wheel and nuts. Too loose is obvious."

880730,DanD,2014-11-14 13:21:00,2223,"I agree 100% on wheel torque on today's vehicles; the old adage of twist the wrench until the wheel nut barks, is a sure way of loosing a wheel, warping wheels, hubs and brake rotors. Here at the shop I will not allow my techs to tighten wheels with their impact guns. They can zip them up; but then its a torque wrench to finish the job.  Dan."

I knew how to do it but I was not prepared for this situation. I called 911 to have them try to radio truckers or other traffic if possible. cops from dryden got over very quick to block the road. I was just a sitting duck prior. thank god nobody got hurt. the police brought a chain and we towed the car off to a safe area. changed the tire. and everything was fine. man was I cold though. If I had been stuck there I could have been in real danger of hypothermia. it was -32 or something like that. everything changed after that. our vehicles always have extra winter gear for the whole family, food and proper tools. i changed that tire on uneven ground too. dont do that if you can avoid it. get roadside assistance or a tow"
