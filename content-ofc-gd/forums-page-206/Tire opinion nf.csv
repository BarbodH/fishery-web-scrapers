880724,DanD,2014-11-14 12:45:00,2223,"The perrelli scorpions they put on the F150s were an embarrassment.  Mine were cracked to rat poop after 4 years and less than 35,000 k.m.  There are no laws here in North America in regards too the age of a tire. I believe there are in some European Countries; that a tire 5 years old or more, cannot be sold as new and a tire that is 5 years old must come off the vehicle. So just because a tire has never been used, doesn't mean they are NEW tires. What I'm trying to say is that the tires that went on Dutch's vehicle could have sat on the shelf for 4 or more years before they were installed on the vehicle? When I order tires into the shop that are ""on sale"" I always check the date code and I have sent tires back because they were 3 or more years old. I don't want customers coming back to me in a year or so and say look  at the weather cracks in the tires I sold them; let alone the safety issues with old tires. Here's an example of a date code that can be found on most tires that are sold here in North America.  Dan. "
880726,Roy,2014-11-14 12:50:00,13728,"I didn't know about the year code, Dan. Thanks."
880880,pike slayer,2014-11-15 03:51:00,1177,i've run the bfg all terrains for years on all my vehicles and i live up a goat path bush road thats pretty gnarly with steep icy hills. They have just come out with new redesigned all terrains called the ko2s. You can probably pick up a set of the originals for cheap since the new ones are out.i have a buddy with the generals and he likes them good overall tire nothing real fancy. Alot of guys are going with the duratracs and they get great reviews but they are pricey.
880882,Freshtrax,2014-11-15 04:17:00,2215,Anyone deal with  PCM tire online ...fair pricing no duty and they seem to have just about anything in stock.   I have had a few buds with the duratrac's and they say they wear quick.   I drive about 45 k per year.
881378,Freshtrax,2014-11-18 01:39:00,2215,Well I lucked out I guess.   I got the crappy tire flyer and duratracs we're buy 3 get one free.   I go into the store and had him check the grabbers and he had a set on the shelf.the kid looked In the computer and one store had a set  Marked clearance 40% off so he price matched them.    766$. Installed taxes included.  There getting installed on wed.   I will post a review in the next few months.   Thanks everyone for their input and opinions.
881402,porkpie,2014-11-18 06:13:00,2521,"I checked into the duratracs at my local CT.  They didn't even have any in the warehouse in stock F150 sizes.  Told me it would be over a month before they could get hold of any.  LOL, good deal on the grabbers!"
881403,Freshtrax,2014-11-18 06:17:00,2215,There are 4 duratracs in 265/70/17 at the fairway rd location in kitchener.  I think there were 4 in guelph also.   Mounted balanced taxes in out the door they were 980.  And you get a 60 dollar mail in rebate.
881408,porkpie,2014-11-18 10:33:00,2521,"Thanks, I ended up ordering the BFG AT anyhow.  I think they will last longer than the duratrac from all I've heard about the duratracs.  Apparently it's an amazing tire that wears out pretty quick!  My last set of BFG's were on my old Chevy for years, and still going strong when I sold it!"
880314,Freshtrax,2014-11-11 06:44:00,2215,"Need new tires for my f150 4x4.   It doesn't see  off-road conditions often but but I do like to get some mud on the tires and I'm usually towing a boat trailer when I do.     Crown land, logging roads ect.   I  am gonna purchase in a week or two and am leaning towards the general grabber at2.  Reviews online are great but does anyone here run these? Opinions?   I can get 4 in the west end of toronto   for 850 installed so the price is right. Also needs to be decent in snow and on ice."
880326,Rod Caster,2014-11-11 12:45:00,5784,"That's a good price, I don't mind General products. They are not top tier tires, but you know that. The Goodyear Wrangler Duramax's are also a decent price and are great in the mud.  Heads up, mud tires suck in the snow/ice. When I had my Mazda B4000, the Duramax's were great in the mud, but were no better than my Wrangler A/T's in the snow."
880327,DanD,2014-11-11 13:12:00,2223,"What size are you wanting and would they be the ""P"" metric or an LT tire? I'd like to compare pricing from my supplier.  Dan."
880328,Djeep,2014-11-11 13:23:00,199,"I've heard good things about the general at2. Also consider cooper at3 and Hercules new at has great reviews also, both are toted to be quiter and smoother than the general.  My pops has the hankook at m they're supposed to be good on ice but my experience is limited."
880330,Muskieman,2014-11-11 13:55:00,2472,"2 years and 60k+ ago I got some Sailun Terramax AT installed on the Expedition and they're almost like new still , lots of ban for the buck right there .. They've seen snow , slush , mud , rock and mikes upon miles of gravel roads... I'm really impressed . They're worth looking into ."
880343,ckrb2007,2014-11-11 15:56:00,449,"I have the Wrangler Duratracs on my FJ Cruiser and they are a great tire.Before them, I had the Hercules Traildiggers and they wore out super fast. The Duratracs are holding up very well."
880347,porkpie,2014-11-11 17:41:00,2521,"I'll be interested in all the responses, my F150 needs new skins also!"
880353,Joeytier,2014-11-11 18:42:00,3990,"At2's are a great tire, one of my favourite a/t's.  keep up on rotation and you should get at least 60-70 k out of them.  They are more than reasonable in mud and rocks and have a nice rigid sidewall design.  I'll likely go back to them on my truck.  My sierra I bought in the summer came with true m/t tires and they are no good for a daily driver, unless you wanna sacrifice road manners and fuel mileage for looks haha"
880355,Raf,2014-11-11 18:47:00,3495,hear good things about the generals  another tire to consider is the firestone destination a/t.  had them on my jeeps the last 5 years and very happy with them and will likely replace them with the same. they should be about the same $$$ as the generals.  duratracs are an excellent tire as well but they are much more of an aggressive tread design than the generals or firestones = increased noise and fuel usage and perhaps overkill for you since you spend most of the time onroad.  more $$$ too.
880357,Freshtrax,2014-11-11 19:04:00,2215,General Grabber AT2 265/70R17 115S - Price for 4 tires $856.00 plus tax (limited stock may take 2-4 days for delivery) Hercules Terra Trac R/S LT265/70R17/E 121/118S - Price for 4 tires $799.00 plus tax   These are the quotes I got. Not sure if the general is  a LT or p rated tire.
880359,Raf,2014-11-11 19:26:00,3495,if those were my choices i would get the generals.
880364,DanD,2014-11-11 20:06:00,2223,"The 115S are not an LT tire but it is a truck tire; a little heavier construction then a Passenger ""p"" rate. The pricing not bad; but when you say plus tax is that both taxes (OTS & HST) The availability could be an issue; I can pull tires from 3 large warehouses and none of them have stock and no word when they will? I know it's easy to undercut another shop; but I could sell those tires for $866.43 all in; that's with me putting my normal mark up on the tire. Just don't know when/if they will be available. Buddy is giving you a good deal on the Hercules; mine for a set of 4 would be another $40. for the set; that's just to buy them.  Dan. "
880366,Joeytier,2014-11-11 20:18:00,3990,The Grabbers are a load range E
880367,davew3,2014-11-11 20:24:00,430,Take a bit of time and look at Cooper AT3.   The rating are good an the ride is excellent.  As for noise they are nice and quite.   I just put a set on my Ram and like them a lot.  Regards
880380,DRIFTER_016,2014-11-11 22:27:00,10439,I just put a set of Hercules Terra Tracs on my vehicle this fall. So far they seem like a good tire. My previous 2 sets were Goodyear Wrangler Silent Armors which I found wore out quite quickly. They are no longer made which is why I switched brands.
880385,Fisherman,2014-11-11 22:46:00,7201,"I know they're not cheap but, Michelin LTX m/s2  Need new tires for my f150 4x4.Also needs to be decent in snow and on ice. What size tires?  I know they're not cheap however I run Michelin LTX M/S on a couple of trucks, long lasting, quiet and very good all round.  I've seen some horror stories with Good for a year and General, wouldn't put either on a wheelbarrow."
880390,spincast,2014-11-11 23:09:00,3279,"just replaced my LTXs after 117,000 k. nice quiet ride, and no problems towing in any of the places I went ."
880399,Freshtrax,2014-11-11 23:59:00,2215,"I got stuck a few times with my ltx's.  They last forever 117 on this set.    One time I got stuck on wet grass!  I find the load up with clay and mud quite easily and don't clean out well. I need something semi aggressive for my fishing expeditions and around my dad's farm.    The short list is the grabbers, cooper stt $$$',  dick crepec fun country,   Or  Kelly Safari tsr."
880405,Joeytier,2014-11-12 01:22:00,3990,Heard nothing but great reviews about those Kelly Safari's!
880409,kenzy31,2014-11-12 01:51:00,261,"As does my '04 F150. The stock Generals that came on it lasted 100,000km. And I wasn't easy on the truck either lol. I've got Firestone Destinations on now but they'll need to go by spring time"
880492,ecmilley,2014-11-13 00:55:00,2163,"spent 16 years in the rubber business and what it comes down to is you get what you pay for. as for a AT tire I ran goodyear wrangler silent armours from 2008-2014 put 125k on them still had decent tread life just getting slippery in the rain. I replaced them this year with another set of goodyears going with wrangler adventure with kevalr (silent arour replacement) overall a slight improvement over the silent armour better in rain very quiet, light tire that helps in the fuel mileage department and it works very good in sand mud crossing creeks, ect has a snowflake symbol for snow duty and hope its at least as good as the original silent armour in that respect. agressive AT hard to beat a bfg all terrain or goodyear dura trac unless you want to get into some d c tires nitto or micky t's"
880514,Freshtrax,2014-11-13 04:57:00,2215,"I guess that's why the grabbers are sold out everywhere.  Snowflake rated,  mileage warantee to 90k, most reviews on tire rack rate them better in snow and on ice than the bfg ko..    To boot they are  2-300 cheaper than anything comparable on the market.      I'm normally not so cheap but the truck also needs new front struts and rear shocks.  Not so bad as I have a spring compressor so I can do that myself.  Sooooo if anyone knows someone with the grabbers in stock.......let me know."
880517,James77,2014-11-13 05:03:00,175,Goodyear Duratrac was absolutely amazing on my 4runner. Amazing in snow and ice and great in mud.
880550,porkpie,2014-11-13 14:31:00,2521,Just ordered the old standby BFG all terrains.  My local dealer had a sale on and priced them so competitively that it was just about 150 more than grabbers and I've always had good luck with the BFG AT in the past!
