Les announced that the derby would make a contribution to the Kids for Christmas of $500.00.The weather gods were on the side of the fishers who partook in the event of Saturday with lots of sun and a little bit of wind. The 0700 blast-off from the Shermans Point Launch Ramp was exciting as the boats scattered, some going to the far east, some to the north-west and some staying close.Some anglers took advantage of weighing their fish early and those who waited to close to 2PM had to mill around the dock as boats were getting fish out and weighed and then taking boats out of the water. The vast majority of the fish entered, swam away under their own, but there were some who didn't and those fish were disqualified.If you believe you have a big enough fish for the board, it would be prudent to have the fish weighed ASAP, rather than leave a fish in the live-well for many hours.Les and the weigh crew brought the final results to the peg Board and Les was ready to announce the four cash prizes.Leading the way with a walleye of 10.3lbs was John Vaughn. Congrats to John for a fine specimen. His fish won him the $700.00 1st prize.Second place went to Troy Elliott, who landed his Personal Best in the Derby, a fine 10.0 lb walleye - Congrats Troy on the PB, They're always a good thing.The third place fish weighing 9.8lbs was shared between Allain & Dennis - a couple of guys who made the trek from Quebec and who are old friends from the Quintefishing.com derby days. It was nice to see you back on the BOQ.The final cash prize for 4th place went to Doug Bookner with a 9.7lb fish. Awfully close - every ounce counts. Way to go Doug.Prior to the draw prizes, Les announced that Black Diamond Cheese had donated a case of four year old Balderson Cheese and it would be auctioned off. The bidding was quick  $20 - $40 - $60 - $80 and finally John Vaughn bid $100.00 for the cheese. well done John.This raised the donation to the Hospital to $600.00. All the entrants should feel pride in their fishing efforts would benefit many children at Christmas.Once again, the food that Les and his crew produced was excellent, the Chili was super and Les offered a new dish this year - a Peach Curry with Venison Sausage - It's a REAL WINNER!!!!!!!!!!  Everyone loved this one - you'll have to make it again next year Les.The crowd was thinning out as the draw prizes were being given out, so the picture of the crowd doesn't do justice to all who attended the 2014 Derby.Everyone I talked to is planning on returning in 2015 and hopefully we can raise more money for the Hospital Kids.I look forward to seeing everyone again next year and possibly before out on the BOQ.Stay Tuned.David  aka  Superdad"
