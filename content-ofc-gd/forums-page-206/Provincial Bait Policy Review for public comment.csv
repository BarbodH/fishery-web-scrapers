880451,Lunker Larry,2014-11-12 15:23:00,122,"A provincial bait policy review regarding the use and angler movement of bait (including baitfish) has been posted on the EBR for public comment / review. See details below.   RE: Provincial Bait Policy Review  The Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry (MNRF) (notice new title) is seeking public comment on policy options associated with:  ·         Angler use and movement of bait in Ontario; and ·         Use and harvest of bait in provincial parks and conservation reserves.  The purpose of the provincial bait policy review is to determine how the ecological risks associated with the use and movement of bait (i.e. baitfish and leeches) can be minimized to help maintain healthy fisheries and aquatic ecosystems, while reducing the complexity of current management regimes and providing business certainty to the bait industry.  The harvest and use of live bait in Ontario has and continues to be an important aspect of fishing in Ontario. However, the movement of live bait also involves ecological risks related to the spread of diseases and invasive species that pose risks to Ontario’s fisheries, provincial parks and conservation reserves, and biodiversity. The following goals have been established to guide the provincial bait policy review: 1)     Bait is managed to protect the health of aquatic ecosystems. 2)     Sustainable use of bait resources enhances the quality of life for Ontarians by providing recreational, social and economic benefits. 3)     Bait is managed to conserve the resource and maintain a viable bait industry. 4)     Bait management is adaptable, effective, consistent across the province and simple to implement. More information regarding the provincial bait policy review can be found in an Information Notice posted on the Environmental Registry (EBR Registry Number: 012-1043) on February 12, 2014.  http://www.ebr.gov.on.ca/ERS-WEB-External/displaynoticecontent.do?noticeId=MTIxNTcz&statusId=MTgyMTM1&language=en There are 5 topics being addressed by the policy review: 1) Angler Use and Movement; 2) Parks and Protected Areas; 3) Commercial Sale and Transport; 4) Allocation; and 5) Reporting.  At this time we are seeking input on the range of policy options being considered specifically for the first two topics. 1)     The Management of Angler Use and Movement of Bait in Ontario: a.     The type of bait anglers are allowed to use (e.g., limited number of species) b.    The scale at which anglers can move bait, such as limiting movement to a specific region, to the Fisheries Management Zone(s) (FMZ), or within a watershed; c.     Angler’s ability to store bait (e.g., angler’s use of bait buckets and cribs) in lakes, rivers and streams d.    Ability of anglers to harvest their own bait e.     Use of bait in defined sensitive areas (e.g., brook trout lakes, Arctic watershed)  2)     The Use and Harvest of Bait in Ontario Parks and Conservation Reserves: a.     The use of commercial bait for angling b.    The use of personally harvested bait for angling c.     Commercial harvest of bait d.    Storage of commercially harvested bait e.     A timeline for phasing out commercial bait harvest in protected areas where this activity is not allowed To provide feedback on the range of policy options, two Policy Proposal Notices related to the above two topics of the policy review were posted on the Environmental Registry on November 5, 2014. Please search for registry numbers: 012-2835 (Use and Harvest of Bait in Provincial Parks and Conservation Reserves) and 012-2836 (Angler Use and Movement of Bait in Ontario). http://www.ebr.gov.on.ca/ERS-WEB-External/displaynoticecontent.do?noticeId=MTIzNjc4&statusId=MTg1NjIy&language=en The postings will be available for comment until December 19th 2014.If you have any questions regarding these postings or the provincial bait policy review please contact [email protected]."

880469,OhioFisherman,2014-11-12 19:40:00,6623,"""By law, you need a valid fishing license (e.g., sport or conservation) to catch your own live:""  ""Only resident anglers can capture bait fish.""  It's discrimination at work! If non residents pay for a license why are they barred from catching their on bait!"
880475,Fisherman,2014-11-12 21:26:00,7201,"Same thing in other venues such as hunting, some areas are open to everyone, others only to residents.  Why can you buy ammo at your place and we can't....rules.. sometimes ya wonder."
