880454,vance,2014-11-12 15:33:00,719,Sid Turcotte park in Mattawa has all you want. I am a seasonal there so I know that it does!!!   vance
880465,fishindevil,2014-11-12 18:11:00,6254,yes anywhere on the mighty ottawa river is awesome....morning mist resort is nice as well as where vance is !!!!!cant go wrong either one....
880527,simonl,2014-11-13 11:12:00,28,"There are a few good opportunities in the valley, but I may be a little biased...lol. quite close to Morning mist is Driftwood PP. less amenities but very private, pull thru sites and a good boat ramp. IMO fishing, the Ottawa R anywhere above the dam in Rolphton is great. Pine Ridge Park in Pembroke area has all the services you talked about with a decent restaurant as well. Town of Pembroke close by for any other needs. Another venue that I have enjoyed in the past is Sunny Hill Resort on Bark Lake near Barry's Bay. Mostly a seasonal CG but They accept transients as well. Hot tub,pool etc and fishing is decent for lakers, walleye, pike and SM. Lake is quite large and very scnenic with very few cottages."
880555,MrSimon,2014-11-13 14:49:00,217,Excellent information guys!  Thank you very much.  I will look into all of these options.
