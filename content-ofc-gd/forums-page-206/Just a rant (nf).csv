880807,mr blizzard,2014-11-14 20:03:00,1589,Thanks Joey for posting and Big Cliff awesome response  My wife just came home for lunch red faced because of problems she was having with logging into a program at work and with her email.  While reading Big Cliffs response she started laughing so hard she had tears in her eyes.  Joey u are not alone for sure
880915,Big Cliff,2014-11-15 15:43:00,6899,"It is a cold winter morning; husband is on his way to work when his cell phone rings, it's a text from his wife:  Wife, ""windows frozen""  Husband: ""pour hot water on it""  A few minutes later;  Wife: ""Now the whole computer is totally messed up""!"
880918,bigugli,2014-11-15 15:56:00,6138,"  Still remember the heat and cooking all coming from the big potbelly stove. Forgetting to warm the seat in the ""honey hut"" on a cold winter's night... Forget about the bathtub, we had Sauna. Didn't have hot and cold running water til the early 70's at Aunt Lily's. Not til the 80's at uncle George's"
880941,Joey,2014-11-15 18:30:00,9122,"We had a sauna too, big rocks, pour some water on them.  The gals went first (me, my sister, mom, two aunts and grandma) and then when we were good and hot, so hot your gold necklace chain hurt, you'd run down and jump in the lake, then back to the sauna   then it  was the men's turn!!!"

I mean you need at least 15 passwords, some more than 8 to 10 letters and numbers combined with an underscore or a symbol.   Jeez.  I just woke up in the middle of the night for some reason and it took me 10 minutes to log on to my computer because I have to have capital this and underscore that and at least one letter and 10 numbers and a symbol and 8 consenants!!!!   I guess I'm just getting old and cranky  Good morning and I'm going back to bed:)"

880529,ketchenany,2014-11-13 11:51:00,3229,"I had my modem (bell) go on the fritz, called for help. The fine person on the other end tells me to look behind the modem and copy down the number. It's 5 pt type and 39 numbers. he directs me to a site and asks me to enter the figures. he then tells me this is your NEW password! Bad words were exchanged and then he took my advice."

Screw you apple you don't need that info I refuse to play."

I have a talent, or curse, that I can remember numbers, from grade school, like my first combination lock, all my family and friends telephone numbers from as early as I could pick up a phone. Heck I know my ex wifes drivers license and SIN. I use all those useless phone numbers long disconnected as passwords.  If anyone knows my Noni's # in NY from 1954, go ahead use it to unlock my PC."

880572,Terry,2014-11-13 16:19:00,14456,Lol My problem is PIN numbers Everything has PIN numbers I have 6 for work and 4 for personal I remember them all but can't seem to remember which are for which device or card. And after 3 strikes youre locked out. And qwert is not allowed.  Some will know what that means.   But they make us change every 3 months anyways TREWQ not allowed too.  For a while walleye then walleye1 walleye2. At walleye10 it made me change the whole word.  Muskie was too small. I said that's ok I was going to release it anyways.  IT. did not get the joke

We also got our water from the well up there!!!!  A big cement well and we had to pump it out into a bucket for drinking or doing the dishes (after heating it on the stove or in the fireplace of course)"

I have the new version in my tent trailer in Alaska. Heated mattresses!!!! Just turn on the generator and thermostats 1/2 before bed and it's toasty warm."
