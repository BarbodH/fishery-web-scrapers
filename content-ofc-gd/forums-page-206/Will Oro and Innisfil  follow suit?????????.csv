HMMMM  So I took a drive around and sure enough,they are all covered up. Looks like there will be no charge for parking for the winter anglers.      I will be emailing both townships and ask if they will be doing the same thing."
881064,Terry,2014-11-16 17:25:00,14456,"no, they will not do the same innisfilltheirpocketswithyourmoney will still charge"
881065,kickingfrog,2014-11-16 17:25:00,8333,I'm not sure about that. They were installing those new protection poles this week and this might just be a temporary thing. I guess we'll see.
881067,misfish,2014-11-16 17:34:00,29133,"Rob every where I went,they were covered up. ALL LOCATIONS"

881083,irishfield,2014-11-16 18:54:00,26272,No plans to plow the lots either....
881197,BillM,2014-11-17 01:41:00,17367,Covered up due to snow removal..  Found this on the City of Barrie website.  I doubt those parking meters are going anywhere.
