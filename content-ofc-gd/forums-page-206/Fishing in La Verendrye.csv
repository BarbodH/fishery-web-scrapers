880808,Leowis1,2014-11-14 20:18:00,1,Hello--my father took me camping and fishing in La Verendrye many years ago and now I wish to take my sons.  But I only speak English and am having a hard time finding information.  I will be towing a camper and will need to rent a motor boat.  Does anybody know where I can rent motor boats up there?  The daily cost?  And the nearest campground to that location?  Many thanks.

880817,Joeytier,2014-11-14 21:46:00,3990,"All the outfitters speak english in the area lol.  As for boat rentals I don't even know if there any, but you can expect a fantastic wilderness fishing trip if you make it."

Cheers Mitch...

The Verandrye was a very busy park back then it was always busy with American tourist and anglers coming from all different U.S  states to enjoy the beautiful scenery  camping and great fishing there are not many American tourist who frequent the park anymore it is mostly fished by the locals now and yes it is still a good fishery.  Cheers Mitch.

Last time was early Aug 2013 We stayed in a cabin at Nadagam.  They also have campsites here for tents,trailers and RVs  Both times I took my own boat They do rent boats at Nadagam  Cabins were very vice solar powered with running hot and cold water. indoor shower and toilet.  Caught a lot of walleye from 14 - 23 inches and a few Pike up to 30 inches."
