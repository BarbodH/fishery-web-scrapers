881195,BillM,2014-11-17 01:28:00,17367,8.... That number sounds eerily familiar with the returns the Credit gets.
881223,ecmilley,2014-11-17 11:58:00,2163,Noble effort but after this many years a failed experiment lets find a better use for those funds
881224,dave524,2014-11-17 12:31:00,4508,Honestly I thought most of the fish in the St. Marys were of natural regeneration so finding a few fry is not any great news.   Even  considering Lake Ontario there is a big difference between finding a few  fry and finding enough to produce a self sustainable  population.
