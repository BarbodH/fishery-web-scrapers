So I will say he mislead me,but I will not buy, as I dont need it,nor would use it.  A nip rig would work just as well IMO,but from threads pasts,this was a debate. So I asked like I said."

Especially designed for ice fishing?.I'm sure stranger things have happened..  Convenience stores sell drug paraphernalia that's apparently illegal. How about those washer fluid squirters you see on some car hoods with red or blue lights...illegal to use, my bro received a ticket. Marijuana seeds? They become illegal once germinated meaning legal to buy, illegal to use. E-cigarette juice containing nicotine is an illegal product, yet people sell and buy it. It's illegal to sell ear candles in Canada, yet may health stores continue to sell them.   I'm sure there are a ton of illegal products out there being sold daily."

I see that woods has got into the hub market. Not a bad price,but have no idea of the quality, as they didnt have one set up.    A few random things.        Propane auger. It,s not the lightest.     Now on to the Jaw Jacker.    I was very surpised to see it for sale there. Alot of talk about if it was legal,or not. Well wouldnt you know it,there was a CO there. I approuched him and asked about it. His answer was they are not allowed in Ontario. I said well,they are over there on the shelf. I showed him. He walked off to talk to someone I guess. I didnt stick around,but will stop in later this week to see if they are still on the shelf."

881102,Salmonidstalker,2014-11-16 20:38:00,265,"Do any of you actually go down rigging?  You can't compare a vertical presentation where there rod actually sets the hooks hen a fish hits the bait, verses diwnrigging where the rod plays no part in setting the hook.  That is the issue, the rod setting the hook.  The clip in down rigging plays very little in ""setting the hook"". The fish gets pinned when it turns and runs away from the boat moving 3 mph.  This product for sure will be off the shelves."
881104,Terry,2014-11-16 20:44:00,14456,"--------------HiI have received several inquiries regarding the legality (use andpossession) of several ice fishing tip ups.One is called the automatic ice fisherman and can be found at:http://www.automaticicefisherman.com/index.htmlIf you view the video on the web site you will see that the Tip up holdsthe rod in such a way that the rod is tensioned similar to a downriggerrod, when the fish takes the bait a release mechanism is activated andthe rod is released indicating a bite, the angler can then grab the rodand set the hook. This type of set up does not meet the definition of aspring gaff - ""spring gaff means a spring-operated device for impalingor hooking a fish and includes sping-loaded hooks that are triggeredwhen a fish bites the bait"" and therefore is legal for use andpossession within 30 meters of any water.A second piece of ice fishing equipment is called the Hook Set Tip Upand can be viewed at http://hooksettipup.com/If you view the video on this site you will see that this tip upcontains a spring that is ""loaded"" when set. When the fish hits thebait and triggers the release the spring mechanism sets the hook, and aflag is released. This set up falls within the definition of a springgaff as noted above, and is therefore not legal for use or possesionwithin 30 meters of any waters.If you have any questions regarding this gear or any other type that youencounter please do not hesitate to contact me.Derrick Humbera/Enforcement SpecialistPeterborough705-755-5186ENFORCEMENT BRANCH MISSION: To safeguard the public interest by leadingand delivering professional regulatory protection of Ontario's naturalresources.-----------------  ""A spring gaff includes any device which uses amechanical spring, other than the fishing rod under tension, toset the hook for an angler."""
881112,G.mech,2014-11-16 21:14:00,830,"From Page 8 of the regs:   So, as we have beaten to death before, these are legal since they only use the rod under tension to set the hook.  Also, even it if wasn't legal, it can still be sold in Ontario as it is not against the law to sell tackle that is illegal to use.
