881511,irishfield,2014-11-18 22:20:00,26272,I might move again Lew! lol
881518,Canuck2fan,2014-11-18 22:27:00,1444,"I might move again Lew! lol  I had the original packaging, and I mean, all of it. Including the plastic foam bag combo for my Pioneer SX4, receiver from around 1983? Sold it for 40 bucks less than I paid for it on ebay 3 yrs ago, because I had all the original stuff it came with. The bids just kept going up up up on that one LOL. So sometimes saving a box pays off..."
881520,lew,2014-11-18 22:29:00,12766,I might move again Lew! lol  I thought you were gonna say the radio was still under extended warranty LOL
881199,adam lancia,2014-11-17 01:51:00,234,"As the topic states, I'm wondering what everyone does with the boxes, packaging and other stuff that comes with a new reel...? I bought a new Revo STX in September and threw the box and sponge padding away as soon as I got home. I regret that now since I'm not sure I want to keep the reel and would like to return it to BPS, but understandably, I would need the original packaging and am now kicking myself for not keeping it. I haven't fished the reel yet since my last outing of the year got kiboshed by that cranky old broad, Mother Nature..."
881201,BillM,2014-11-17 01:56:00,17367,"I always keep my boxes, especially for the reels.  Great place to keep the gear lube/schematic that usually comes along with it."
881203,porkpie,2014-11-17 02:16:00,2521,"I often keep the boxes for the warranty period, but outside of that I chuck them.  I definately keep all packaging for an unused item that I am not sure about for at least the duration of the return period."
881204,kickingfrog,2014-11-17 02:23:00,8333,"So, throw them in the trash outside the store so my wife doesn't know is not an acceptable answer?"
881205,mattaw,2014-11-17 02:32:00,162,"Keep them, if you sell them later on, people tend to want them... they just go into a bigger box..."
881206,Terry,2014-11-17 02:34:00,14456,where would I put 53 boxes
881208,NANUK,2014-11-17 02:35:00,797,I keep the box and everything it comes with.
881209,Pigeontroller,2014-11-17 02:40:00,2793,"Keep 'em, storage, shipping for repairs/maintenance, selling...They look cool in my garage cabinet!"
881215,Bondar,2014-11-17 03:36:00,817,"Haha I keep them, probably a couple kicking around here"
881216,adam lancia,2014-11-17 04:08:00,234,"Sounds like I need a garage or bigger house so I can have a room for my toys... One day when I grow up. Until then, anyone have a Revo STX 6.4:1 LH box and packaging they wouldn't mind letting go of...? There's tons of good karma and a coffee in it for ya!  LOL!"
881225,aplumma,2014-11-17 12:32:00,6896,If you cant find a box just a few more posts and you can list it in the classifieds here.   Good luck  Art
881227,OhioFisherman,2014-11-17 12:55:00,6623,As a former collector I have seen a lot of intact reel boxes and associated packaging materials go for more than the price of the reels when purchased. Condition means a lot!
881229,lew,2014-11-17 13:09:00,12766,Once my reels go on the rods the boxes go out for recycling just like everything else I don't need. I always tell my wife if she doesn't use something for a week  it's gone

881238,manitoubass2,2014-11-17 15:29:00,11391,"recycling for me.  I rarely buy high end reels and I get my use outta the ones I buy.  most my reels perform awesome with exception being ice fishing reels. I could careless if a $25 dollar reel craps out on me after two or three seasons.  I might keep the boxes however if I had the room.  I hate stuff lying around taking up space however. ask my better half. all her work trips mean garbage clean up for me. bags and bags and bags lol  this usually means alot of donations too.  I learned one thing though, DO NOT EVER, UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCE, THROW AWAY CANNING MATERIALS.  her foot came down purdy hard on that one"
881241,Roe Bag,2014-11-17 16:21:00,246,"I always keep my boxes, especially for the reels.  Great place to keep the gear lube/schematic that usually comes along with it. I keep the original packaging for most everything. Cameras, lenses, fish finders, other small electronics, reels, etc. Seems you get a better price when it comes time to resell. For whatever reason a buyer is more easily enticed if it's all there and intact."
881244,Andy,2014-11-17 17:07:00,330,"Lew, I wouldn't give my wife an ultimatum like that. I'm glad that you get to use everything at least once a week."
881250,Lape0019,2014-11-17 17:46:00,647,"I have a cabinet that all of my fishing gear goes into. Every box that came with a reel is in there. It is an easy way to find a schematic and all of the stuff that comes with the reel stays in there until it is needed.  I also take all of the line off of my reels, back off the drag and cast control setting and then put the reel back in the box for the winter."
881311,musky666,2014-11-17 21:53:00,126,"I have all my high end Shimano boxes- as mentioned- boxes within a bigger box. The few reels I have picked up from Kijiji and OFC classifieds etc, all came with boxes..."
881319,bare foot wader,2014-11-17 22:23:00,1354,"used to be a collector or frequent buyer and seller, kept everything...sold off a bunch past few years to fund new stuff...now all packaging hits the woodstove  keep schematics on the expensive reels, get tossed into a drawer along with all the little packs of oil and vbs brakes,etc i've accumulated  I actually witnessed a guy refuse to buy a last in stock demo reel at 10% off because it didn't come with the box, to me that is odd but to each their own"
881350,MCTFisher9120,2014-11-18 00:18:00,3761,"I keep the box if the reel is worth more than $50 or so. Core's, Stella's, Chronarch's I have the box for each reel I own except for 1. If you decide you want to sell the reel it will get you a few extra bucks 9 times out of 10. Takes up room but o well."
881389,adam lancia,2014-11-18 02:35:00,234,"Looks like the panel is split on this one. If I had the room, I'd keep the boxes, even if my wife did tell me that it serves no purpose other than to occupy space. I would only have 4 reel boxes if that were the case... Anyone know of any inexpensive, weather-tight storage solutions for in our backyard...? 5'x10' would likely do it. I should add that we're only renting a house at the moment, however, my parents live nearby so if we were to pick up the family again, they would be glad to inherit it. Thoughts...? I'd just keep it close enough to the house that I could run an extension cord to it for a little space heater."
881395,Canuck2fan,2014-11-18 03:15:00,1444,"I tend to keep them now, good for keeping the swag that comes with them in as noted by others. Also had some evidence that it does help resale too.  We had a moving sale for my parents on the weekend EVERY reel in a box (even if dad packaged them wrong) SOLD. Even the more expensive shimanos sat, because they weren't in a box, over the cheapie mitchells and diawas. I guess 7 bucks is the cut off point for used fishing gear too LOL."
881418,BillM,2014-11-18 14:06:00,17367,My Antares AR box is almost as cool looking as the reel!
881434,mukluk,2014-11-18 15:22:00,196,Store my reel boxes up in the rafters of the basement.
