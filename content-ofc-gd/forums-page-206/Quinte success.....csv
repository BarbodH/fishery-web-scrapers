The weather was nasty... 30km/hr winds pretty much for 3 days straight with some gusts way stronger... Made it challenging to fish in a 16 foot tiller... But we managed...  Boated 7 walleye and 2 sheepshead in 3 days fishing... We weren't able to fish a lot of hours per day due to the wind so we were happy with our results...  And we landed 2 really big fish...  First up a 19 pound sheepshead!!!!       And the true trophy of the trip was this fat 12 pound walleye... 30.5""x19""       It was a challenging trip and with that weather we all had little patience and short fuses but there were no punches thrown... Lol... But a few hugs after catching that tanker... And several beers to celebrate...  Not sure if I'll make it back up this year again but now it's time to get some local piggies...  Mike"
880759,LostAnotherOne,2014-11-14 16:44:00,956,You probably thought that sheepshead was a big walleye.  Nice fish anyways
880760,Dutch01,2014-11-14 16:46:00,1431,WOW!  What a hog walleye!  That thing would eat the walleye I catch at Balsam!
880769,Terry,2014-11-14 17:44:00,14456,nice sheephead  and walleye  I love quinte
880772,Hank Jr,2014-11-14 17:53:00,146,Nice Walleye thanks for the report
880800,OhioFisherman,2014-11-14 18:47:00,6623,Nice!
880876,Tim Mills,2014-11-15 02:59:00,476,That Sheepshead is insane.
880902,Fish Farmer,2014-11-15 14:13:00,2234,"Way to go Mike, thanks for the report. I'm heading down Monday for 4 days. By the looks of the weather and wind it's going to be a challenging trip. Are any fish in the triangle or are they down the reach, Kieth's, Lighthouse, Bat-cave or farther? You can tell right away if it's a Sheephead or Walleye,"
880983,mike rousseau,2014-11-16 01:35:00,4661,Thanks everyone...  Felt good to get back on the e Larry and get some fast action...  Took my dad out for what might be our last trip together this year and lit em up...  About 20 walleye in 2 hours... All 16-20 inches... Good eaters....  Then got out for 3 hours this afternoon and got 4 more including a double header of 7 pounders...
881019,wormdunker,2014-11-16 08:32:00,1711,"Nice fish Mike, thanx for the pix.  We often get large sheepshead on Erie but never a 19 lber.  Usually 7 or 8lb sheepshead maximum."
881039,Rod Caster,2014-11-16 14:08:00,5784,That walleye and the Drum are huge. Nice catches Mike
