880859,cram,2014-11-15 01:41:00,1733,Very nice.  Congrats.
880872,Tim Mills,2014-11-15 02:49:00,476,"Nice Musky Landry, any details, lure? Trolling? Casting?"
880875,landry,2014-11-15 02:58:00,1005,"It was trolling - on a super stalker 30' back. We were taking a break from casting trying to warm up. It was a lot fatter than it looks as i have its belly resting on my knee. We each got two others casting under 40"" that day. Another day this fall I got 5 up to 43"". The other two days I got skunked totally. Had a good summer casting with good numbers and size. Been a good year overall."
