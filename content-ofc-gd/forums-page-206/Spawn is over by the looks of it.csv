880362,esoxansteel,2014-11-11 19:48:00,1307,Hope Ralphie didnt roll in any dead sammins
880371,davey buoy,2014-11-11 20:54:00,5505,"What's that with dead fish and dogs?,growing up on the beach of blue water,we used to get our share of dead fish,maybe shiners?,thinking they were maybe something else,but can't remember now, every couple years.The dogs just loved to roll in those dead fish piles."
880381,manitoubass2,2014-11-11 22:28:00,11391,"my dogs would totally just eat them. which is kinda gross but id prefer that to rolling around in them. my dogs love lampreys too. yuck. dont even chew, just swallow  nice pics joey!"
880384,spincast,2014-11-11 22:46:00,3279,"Great to see they escaped the roe rapers. a couple fish completed their journey. With luck, perhaps more will make that journey every year."
880386,Beans,2014-11-11 22:59:00,3339,Don't know if dogs rolling in dead fishes is any worse than when Riley rolled in a dirty diaper that someone had thrown under some bushes to hide..  Not too far from where Ralphie  and Joey are...
880401,Joey,2014-11-11 23:59:00,9122,"Hahaha, thanks, no, Ralphie did not roll in the salmon, or try to eat them, he just was fascinated when they got to shallow water and tried to traverse the rocks, so he sat on that rock and waited and watched.  He gave the dead fish a sniff, then moved on."
880407,chris.brock,2014-11-12 01:40:00,4053,Ralphie pictures are always appreciated
880413,Old Ironmaker,2014-11-12 02:21:00,8243,Any of your pics are a pleasure to see.
880418,Joey,2014-11-12 03:03:00,9122,"Thanks guys, guess my next set of pics will be ice fishing ones   Bring on the hard water.  You ready Terry ??"

880607,dave524,2014-11-13 19:19:00,4508,"Late runs everywhere, there's still fish out in the lake  For sure, Some Cohoes run extremely late, used to see fresh chrome fish with ice forming in the Credit during Christmas break. Actually have seen a Coho with a bit of life still in it at spring breakup."
