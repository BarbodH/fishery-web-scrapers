880630,chris.brock,2014-11-13 22:00:00,4053,"thanks TJ, I was sitting silently for quite a while, when my walkie talkie radio made a weird squelch, feed back noise, it sounded like a lion's roar, it started soft then got louder, I nearly pooped my pants because I didn't know what was going on  another interesting thing, I was sitting quietly in a hole, looking down at a clearing, I heard a branch snap from behind me, then I heard a person cough- for the life of me I couldn't figure out the best way to let that person know I was there without scaring the hell out of them, or me getting shot, Hahaha"
881048,can u fish,2014-11-16 15:11:00,326,Thanks for the post Chris a lot of good  times and memories are had at the hunt camp. Thanks for sharing.  Cheers.
879754,chris.brock,2014-11-07 00:58:00,4053,"On a frosty November morning, I sit silently. The sun isn't up yet, but it's finally bright enough to see. If I look to my right, I can catch the odd glimpse of Bruce's orange hat and vest between the hardwoods. I scan below, down to the hemlocks and the creek. The silence is deafening yet somehow therapeutic.The bush and myself don't make a sound.  The eerie silence is broken with what sounds like a cannon going off. It echos through the valleys. The distance away, and the direction it came from, is hard to tell. Then dead silence again.  My radio comes alive and a voice softly whispers.  ""did you guys shoot?""  then whispered responses- ""no"", ""nope"", and I chime in with a quiet voice, ""no""  We are not alone in these ridges and valleys, and rifle season has begun.    In a place called Galloway, at a camp called Ponderosa, the membership has dwindled. Being a sharp shooting, cold blooded citiot, with an appetite for straight whiskey and adventure, I was lucky to be invited along.  Bruce, the camp owner, Randy, the crazy down' easter, Dr David Suzuki, and myself would search for deer and squatches in the hills around camp.  David making the slow ride into camp.     Home sweet home.     Dr Suzuki was great to have in camp. His wealth of biological and ecological knowledge, is unsurpassed.  After an unsuccessful first day, David sat us down at the table. He remained standing, and said-  ""The deers are now eating the pine nuts and spruce balls. What are you girls doing in the hemlocks? Holding hands? GET INTO THE TAMARACKS AND GET YOUR THUMBS OUT OF YOUR BUTTS!""  Point taken.    Randy tells David and Bruce about how to call a squatch.    I love older camps and their history. There's similarities and differences between hunt camp and fish camp.  similarities- rustic accommodation lots of time outdoors drinking and comradery  differences- instead of rods and baits we have guns and ammo there's no catch and release at hunt camp for obvious reasons, drinking during mid-day is generally frowned upon at hunt camp  stuff that can be found at an old hunt camp      the only thing that was harvested this trip, was Randy's mouse    David Suzuki, in his pajamas, smooth bore, rifled slug,  paper plate at 50 yds        group shot    We saw 5 moose, I was the only guy to see deer, 3. I watched a doe for about a minute, I didn't like the shot, and didn't pull the trigger. No regrets.  A great trip. Hopefully we all get to my cottage for some ice fishing in a couple months."
879765,Steve,2014-11-07 03:38:00,2075,"I'm the furthest thing from a hunter, but spending time with Mr Suzuki is something I'd never pass up.  very cool report.  I picture him to be a single malt guy."
879768,Sinker,2014-11-07 04:19:00,8692,Tell us more about the mouse? Running shot? Slug or rifle? How were the tenderloins? Tough drag out?  LOL  Good times I'm sure. That's what its all about!   S.

879828,Old Ironmaker,2014-11-07 16:39:00,8243,"Oh yea Suzuki loves killing wildlife, great for the balance of nature. Look closely folks, it's a joke, close maybe, but 25 years younger and a lot less white hair. Fun read though."

879865,aplumma,2014-11-07 22:01:00,6896,Good read Chris glad you got out to go hunting. We are just getting out of the bow season and into black powder down here and then the rifle season runs till March. We have soooo many deer around here we call them woodrats thus the long season to try to keep them in check.   Art

Being a sharp shooting, cold blooded citiot, with an appetite for straight whiskey and adventure, I was lucky to be invited along.  Great read through and through Chris.   A clean shot to well enjoyed bud!  It's always a treat to catch hunt camp stories this time of year... and wonder if taking up hunting would be something to do.  Thanks for sharing.  Tell us more about the mouse? Running shot? Slug or rifle? How were the tenderloins? Tough drag out?  Shane!!!"

880480,Cookslav,2014-11-12 22:19:00,1457,"Great read!  I just bought a camp this past spring....many timeless relics on the shelves and in the drawers as well. Its like a time capsule at some of these camps, and very cool!"
