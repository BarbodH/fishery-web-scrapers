There are more than a few vehicles in the ditch upside down, and lots of ice on the roads in the open sections.Wal-Mart Chinese winter tires performed very well again this eve. LOLBuy the way, where can I pick up a few more road flares at a reasonable price?Be safe, Entropy"

881394,Entropy,2014-11-18 03:13:00,747,"fire crews were putting them out.   I had to shake my head at where one fireguy put one ..... no no,  you need one way around the blind curve in the road ... Let people know to slow down before they start skidding into the scene.      Tossed me a couple to run around the corner, ... common sense, eh.Sadly lives are lost every year on the curves I drive, ... and to think the region just re-constructed one this summer to make it safer."
881405,wormdunker,2014-11-18 07:35:00,1711,"Yup we got 3-4"" of snow here in Niagara, not nice driving at all.  Now the cold weather has settled in.  -7 right now.  I got the yammy winterized yesterday just in time!"
881410,adam lancia,2014-11-18 11:50:00,234,"It seems that each seasons first ""snow shock"" (the shock and surprise folks in snowy climates exhibit when the first snow hits each season...) is creeping further north each year. It's sad to see, especially when you consider how many lives are put at risk by folks who are just plain ignorant to the skills they need to drive in winter weather. I'm used to seeing folks react as if it's the first time they've seen snow here in the city, that's a given every year. Get a dusting and it's mayhem! LOL"
881435,DRIFTER_016,2014-11-18 15:37:00,10439,No different up here in Yellowknife Adam. The first couple of snow falls there were people running into each other and other objects all over town. All I can do is shake my head and hope they don't take me out.
881469,Entropy,2014-11-18 18:52:00,747,"The region rebuilt one set of these curves, and now the ditches are a lot deeper.  Before cars would skid gently off into the shallow ditch, or off into the corn.  From what I saw last night, now the front right corner of the car is catching the far side of the ditch and flipping them.  So many ditches have been dug down deep over the last few years, I understand drainage is good, but things seemed to drain well before?Maybe someone's 'friend' needs some free fill?  Entropy"
