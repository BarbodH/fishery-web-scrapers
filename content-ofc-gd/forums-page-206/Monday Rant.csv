Then I wander around the store, look at some new blinking LED rope lights.  cute, turn the box over, read the instructions.  Item rated at 120 volt AC 60 Hz, 2.5 watts, little further down the box, do not plug into 120 volt ...ok, what in jeez would you have me plug it into.  More junk comes from that place, it's beyond belief."
