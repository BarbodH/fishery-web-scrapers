880532,Garnet,2014-11-13 12:36:00,2056,I've been to Cape Cod 3 times fishing mostly Stripe Bass but the Ditch has every species.  The setups I've bought are 10ft St Croix Mojo surf 1oz - 3oz  and a 5500 Shimano Ultergure long cast reel. 30lb braid with 50lb big game leader. This outfit is use casting 8 inch wooden plugs and 2-4oz bucktails.  The other is a 9 ft Tica 1-3 oz river rod with a 5500 Penn Spinning reel use mostly for casting spoons and bottom fishing cutbait. Again 30lb braid and 50 lb big game leaders.  Both of these setups are surf models so very long butt section would make them impossible for boat or yak fishing.  I've bought 3-4 other setups from BPS that I've returned. Anything less than the 5500 series reels just don't cut it. If you take a boat rod to the beach you just cant get the distance so you are kind of in a bind.  I talked to many surf guys and 20- 30lb braid main line is about middle of road.
880551,Garnet,2014-11-13 14:32:00,2056,These outfits are compromise for the amount of time I can surf fish. 1-2 weeks per year and the price I'm willing to pay.  Both setups about 1k.  The stuff I would like to fish. 7000 series Van Stal reel  $1400 only has 5 moving parts and another 7-800 for 12ft Lamaglas surf. Still would run 30lb braid.  Diawa has a spinning reel with a 60lb drag only available from Japan. Suitable to Wicked Tuna fish with spinning. 4k. I made a few cast with one but didn't get to test the drag.
880092,BillM,2014-11-10 01:02:00,17367,"No matter what braid you pick, I'd be running some thick flouro leaders.... 30-40lb would be the ticket and might save you from a few bite offs."
880110,Raf,2014-11-10 02:04:00,3495,"everyone has their favourite braid, but they're all pretty much the same when it comes to abrasion resistance -- not as good as mono.   braid's strength lies with pull strength for a given diameter and lack of stretch.  i know you said you'll be using wire and that's just fine.. just a fyi, the whole fluoro leader trend that moved over to freshwater muskie fishing all started with saltwater guys using them on their fish toothy fish."
880113,cram,2014-11-10 02:26:00,1733,"Some braids - like powerpro - absorb a lot more water than others, and it's a pain in the ass.  I also don't like all the green dye coming off and spreading everywhere."

880122,Garry2Rs,2014-11-10 10:19:00,1425,"First of all, the same two fibers are used to make all top quality braids. These are covered by different patents, but are so close to being the same they are called ""sisters."" Therefore there can't be much difference in abrasion resistance between brands. Second, your reel is only rated for ten pound test mono...In theory, you could use up to 40 braid but as you go up in strength, you will lose casting distance. Faced with your challenges, I think I would use 20 or 30 pound test Power Pro Zero Impact. This line has black ""Termination Zones"" every few yards, where the line is 50% stronger.  By tying knots in these areas, you can retain 100% of the rated line strength."
880125,misfish,2014-11-10 10:50:00,29133, LOL…ok…here goes…AGAIN………..I WILL BE USING WIRE!!!  That should be clear now Simon.    I think 2Rs hit it for you.  Have a fun trip.
880129,singingdog,2014-11-10 11:06:00,1047,"I have used most of the braids on the market, and haven't found a difference in abrasion resistance. I have had more spinning-reel problems with suffix than with PPro, but that could be user-error (most line issues are). I don't know the exact conditions you will be fishing, but a 10-20' length of flouro in front of the wire should solve any abrasion problems, and not affect castability."

Be interesting to find out why you have the problems you do. Perhaps the type of fishing Lew; there are a lot of zebra mussles in Sturgeon and I am constantly dragging a jig through the weeds and over logs. if I get a nick in the mono I can feel it just by running my fingers over it but I couldn't with the braid. I did like the line for it's casting ability and solid hook sets but I just found I was loosing too many fish that wern't snapping the line, it would suddenly just let go like it was a piece of thread."

Thanks Bare foot,  Its neither surf nor pier. Its a cove with a small entrance facing directly into the oncoming easterly that is a constant in Antigua. The cove is surrounded by 100 foot high cliffs all around. You have to trek through a thorn jungle, then lower yourself into a thorny ravine and that brings you to a small 'beach' of giant bolders. You are basically standing on a coral/rock platform at the base of a cliff.  You are not surrounded by anyone. The guy that caught the shark was only the second person I have ever seen there. He was a local guy who camped out over night. He only knew about the spot because he used to work at the now ruined hotel on the nearby beach which was destroyed by a Hurricane Luis in 1995). The first guy I met there was a guy called Nick who was guiding a client and fly fishing for Tarpon, that was back in 2003.  The guy Nick has a youtube channel...... https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC16nOK_Jnq-R-yIoI3WnLhw , I have sent an email and am trying to book a half day of mangrove Tarpon fishing with him.  The guy that camped out had hooked into the baby Thresher Shark at night. I kid you not, he was using an old rusty reel with what looked like about 400lb test...yup...400lb....lol. He had an assortment of nuts and bolts as a sinker and was using sprats from the market as bait. That was the only thing he caught.  Will try the flouro leader then the wire.   Man...January cant come quick enough!"

The packaging is far and away the best of all lines I've ever bought...makes spooling a breeze.  That being said, I've tried nearly every braid on the market and here's my order of quality  1) Sunline 2) Suffix 3) Spiderwire 4) PP  PP is awful for casting in my opinion and I have used it a lot.  All the abrasion resistance talk is a bit off base.  For the same # test braid will not stand up to mono in terms of being cut off due to abrasion but think about that...you are comparing a fibres that have such a huge difference in diameter its like comparing the abrasion resistance of a 2 gauge wire to a 10 gauge.  It's just not a real comparison.  Mono and flouro are thick and bulky and so stand up to being beaten up better because there is much more material to be removed before failure.  You absolutely cannot expect the same performance in that category and if you do you're just not thinking.  If you're fishing where you're going to be broken off because of abrasion use the right tool for the job.  Don't use the wrong one then complain that the tool is not good."

Well like I have said before in this thread, I never have believed braid and mono are the same in terms of abrasion, and I never once suggested that I was comparing the two, this thread has always been about comparing apples to apples, or at least the qualities they share or do not share, just a simple question of what…if any…braid is more resistant to abrasion than others. As for your suggestion or comment about ""just not thinking"" I think all the time….and yes I make some mistakes, but thats how we evolve as fishermen and women and a species as a whole. I am not a newbie to fishing and I don't expect the same performance from braid as mono but have stated my purposes for going this route AD INFINITUM!!!  As for complaining about my tools….I aint complaining, I'm trying new things with help from others. Whats to complain about?…..I got snapped off a couple of times by a huge Trevalli Jack and some monster Barracuda while fishing a pelican infested cove, full of baitfish swirling in panic on a tropical island paradise? Sucks not to have landed them, but the anticipation of and privilege of getting another crack at it is awesome!  I appreciate your input.  Thanks.   Simon."

Abrasion resistance is also very important as there will be sharp rock and sea coral present.

The super slick casts better on baitcasters but since you are using a spinning reel, I really don't think you need to go that route. Plus, regular braid cuts through weeds easier."
879944,Joeytier,2014-11-08 22:16:00,3990,"Yep, regular PP is still the best braid I've ever used, but like others said, braid is not abrasion by nature, so a 15-20 lb leader of berkley big game or something similar wiukd be your best bet."

Cheaper than a lot of braids too.  I tried Power pro, too noisy coming thru the guides for me. Both lose color after a while, as do all braids to one extent or another. I don't mind the suffix 832, but it's noisier than Stealth. I have never found one brand to be much different in abrasion resistance than the other. The wire leader is good for the teeth, but I think some guys would use a longer flouro leader with it to prevent breakoffs when the line scrapes across the corral or rocks when the fish runs."

Not relative to many ares of the province but the sea is full of corral and other shells that rip all types of lines to shreds.  I love braid (or superlines), use them just about all the time and spools last years before I flip it around and continue to use it for a few more years.  But, it doesn't hold up to heavy abrasion the way fluoro, or even mono, does. That's just the way it is.  If you don't need it, great, don't use it, I only use it when I have to.  Braid doesn't stand up to sharp teeth the way a good fluoro does either and there are lots of big, and small, fish in the sea with teeth that make a muskie look like a bass.  "

I actually prefer to stay as light as possible anyway. Mono is not an option. I am not concerned about the teeth, I stated already I will be using wire leader, this will not shred at all and will hold up to the smaller cuda and white tip reef sharks that frequent the bay (last time I was there a guy had even landed a small thresher shark right next to me).  I know braid is not as resistant to abrasion as mono. However, in my circumstances I need to use braid for the reason mentioned above. Another reason for staying light is I will be chucking lures not more than 1 oz in weight. I know these lures work as the first three I sent out last time I was there were munched immediately but my 20lb braid was not enough for the job, I was neither bit off or cut off on rocks, straight weight of the fish, each time. Lost those three lures and they did not want to touch anything else i had, even bigger lures.  I really only want to know which out of all the braids is the most abrasion resistant, if they are all the same so be it, but some seem to say they are more resistant….is this truth or marketing., and if its true which is the best of the better….lol that make sense?"
