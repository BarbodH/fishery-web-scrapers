Do you think fish like brown and rainbow trout are still willing to bite on lures like spinners and spoons casted from the pier at this time of year, or is it better just to cast out some roe and let it sit on the bottom.  I still havent caught one yet this fall due to me starting university !!  Thanks Matt"
880530,Craigson,2014-11-13 12:08:00,117,Guys were getting them in st clair river on spoons n spinners just this week. Saw a couple 30+ inchers caught. Good luck
880534,BillM,2014-11-13 13:09:00,17367,Absolutely.
880563,davew3,2014-11-13 15:34:00,430,"Matt,  go down to Spencer and cast 3/4 oz cleos blue/green/silver off the wall.  Just don't snag anyone walking by.   Also you can try small stuff   like a number 1 Mepps or a 2 inch rapala.. I use those when I could see the fish cruising by. Off the canal pier, just choose the side with the wind at your back.   Another trick is jig with a spoon right off the end of the pier.  may end up with a giant laker.  regards "
