94099,scuro,2007-07-15 14:20:00,386,"    Took these pics in late June. I see these clumps all year long on this five mile SW Ontario body of water. Way up on some of the feeder creeks the water is clear. Someone postulated that this could be spring turnover or caused by migrating birds. There is a significant geese population of say 30 birds that stays for most of the year. Is this geese poop, farm runoff, sewage ""treatment"", or caused by some other form of nature?"
94102,Tacklebuster,2007-07-15 14:25:00,303,"I think its excessive amounts of algae which might be caused by all of those things you mentioned, combined with the warmer temps and lack of rain.   I don't think it has anything to do with sewage."
94104,Fish Farmer,2007-07-15 14:33:00,2234,Almost looks like Pier 4 Hamilton. Just think I just had a coffee from that water.
94211,boatman,2007-07-15 22:04:00,350,"That's algae, alright. Judgin only by those two photos, I'd say its completely normal for this time of year and current weather conditions at that location. Algae thrives in warm, nutrient rich, calm and/or high sunlight exposed waters. Looks like that one has all of those things."
94239,lunkerbasshunter,2007-07-15 23:27:00,2585,i have seen that in the woodstock resovoir(not sure the real name)  it is algae and it happens with warmer water and no rain.  Happens in some big shallow lakes sometimes to.  Cheers!
94356,scuro,2007-07-16 02:32:00,386,So then one shouldn't see this stuff in fall when it cools? I've seen it thick in the fall.
94360,Greencoachdog,2007-07-16 02:38:00,8163,EWWWWWWWWWW DUDE!!!... those are fecal chunks!!!  Have you ever eaten too much fresh fruit....   should be good Carp fishin' there though!
94468,scuro,2007-07-16 12:46:00,386,"Any experts here?...or someone who could point me in the right direction for further reading, other resources? I would like to find out exactly what causes this."
94738,boatman,2007-07-16 22:30:00,350,"Algae blooms in various conditions, even under ice in winter. Algae can thrive under any of the following conditions. Warm, nutrient rich, calm or high sunlight exposed waters. In combination, you generally get large algal blooms like the one in your pictures.  If you would like some further reading do an internet search on ""Algae Blooms or Growth"" or ""eutrophication""."
