92888,Nemo,2007-07-11 13:41:00,727,Beauty Report thanks for putting it up.
92891,Hooked,2007-07-11 13:54:00,891,"Wow, that was a great report!  That place looks amazing, would love to spend 2 weeks up there.  Perhaps one day I'll give it a shot out there.  Nice going, I mean really nice going.  Thanks for sharing."
92895,Motorhead,2007-07-11 14:07:00,163,AWESOME report thanks for sharing...
92896,tbayboy,2007-07-11 14:07:00,1497,"Thanks everyone, happy to share it and if you get a chance to head up that way I highly recommend it (and thats just the tip - keep going west and/or north and you've got the insanity of Lac Seul and Vermillion among about a million other lakes).  PigeonFisher - every year we say we're gonna downsize to beans and kraft dinner and every year we stock up with nothing but the best.  Costs more of course but hey, I ain't 15 any more  TackleBuster - if you look at the video I think you can see the lip grips in my hand, we were hoping to get them both in but he spat it a bit too early (there was a net too, not sure why I hadn't thought of that)."
92904,Headhunter,2007-07-11 14:38:00,5703,"Fantastic report... got me "":pine'in"" for a trip up north! Thanks so much for taking the time... as many already mentioned, great pic and I felt I was with right there with you! (I wish!) HH"
92909,Fishnfiend,2007-07-11 15:02:00,357,"Thanks for taking the time to share that with us!  (I know how long it takes)  A definite candidate for report of the year!  As for good food and wine.  Why wouldn't you take the best?  After all, you are on vacation and the idea is to enjoy yourselves, not just make do."
92914,Bcee,2007-07-11 15:08:00,25,"What a great trip, report and pics!  Looks like you guys had a blast!!  Thanks for sharing!  PS, Grappa made me see colors..ONCE.  Tell me more about the jig setup when you get a chance.  My email is [emailÂ protected]"
92915,LeXXington,2007-07-11 15:12:00,1928,"Man, seeing that many ""Eye's"" there is now a tear in my eye  great report and pics"
92920,tbayboy,2007-07-11 15:20:00,1497,"Bcee - the jig setup was a tip from solopaddler (and others) on this thread: http://www.ofncommunity.com/forums/index.php?showtopic=8694 .  Just your basic jig with a curly tail grub and a small piece (1/2 inch or so) of worm on it.  Here's a sampling of the lures/rigs that worked for me (missing the ones lost to the god of the lake):    <a href=""   title=""Photo Sharing""><img src=""http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1023/772989242_ad75c530cf.jpg"" width=""375"" height=""500"" alt=""What worked"" /></a>"

93022,bigbuck,2007-07-11 19:03:00,2449,What a great report!!! Some nice looking fish there and some beautiful Northern scenery.
93039,mason05,2007-07-11 19:33:00,258,That was one of the best reports I've read.  Sounds like you and your buds had a blast.  Awesome pickerel by the way!  Thanks for posting.  Corn Nug
93065,Carmen,2007-07-11 20:24:00,72,Looks like a blast of a good time. Great fish
93107,danc,2007-07-11 21:32:00,4677,Awesome report Sean. Good old Lac. A local favorite for sure. Does Mr. Clara know that you guys buried his truck up to the axles?
93111,tbayboy,2007-07-11 21:42:00,1497,"Haha Dan, you recognized it did ya? Well Mr. Clara is now retired (well as retired as he gets) and our reckless driver is his son Dave who now runs the joint so we figured we were ok but when Mr. Clara met us out on the water one of the days (didn't get this part of the story in the original post) Dave told him (guess he figured we had 20 feet of water between us so it was safe) and we got nothing bust a nasty glare but then his buddy broke out laughing and he loosened up a bit.  Gotta agree with the 'good old lac' - she never lets you down, great fishery but one of these days we'll have to get your advice on some good trout spouts but I'm not sure you'd want us knuckleheads near anything you like"
93121,Abberz,2007-07-11 22:06:00,140,Quite possibly the best report I've ever seen.  I can't get over that pike hammering that walleye!

92770,tbayboy,2007-07-11 02:48:00,1497,Thanks guys. The stubby is red cap - they had a limited edition bob and doug mackenzie stubby case a few weeks ago and one of the guys had some left.  As for the length I made a point of scribbling down a note each night so I'd remember what had happened then I just sat down and started typing but getting it all set was a nice reminder of all the fun so I didn't mind the time taken at all.
92779,PatrickGG,2007-07-11 02:59:00,562,Awesome report Tbay you guys looked like you had a blast and the fish fry sure looks yummy.
