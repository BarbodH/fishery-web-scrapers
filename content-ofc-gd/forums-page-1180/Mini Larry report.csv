94217,Roy,2007-07-15 22:33:00,13728,"Was rainy and windy all morning.....saw an opening in the sky this afternoon so I went out fast with the intention of picking up a pickerel or two. Still very windy...whitecaps everywhere. So, I  ran an orange and gold original rap behind a 2 ounce bottom bouncer and picked this little guy up. Gunna be eating it in a few miutes with pork ribs. BTW  I saw a couple of very large muskies in the shallows...just sunning.  I'll head out tomorrow with J for some fishing.  Be well everyone. "
