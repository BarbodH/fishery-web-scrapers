I launch in front of Marina down below the beer store, marina closed yesterday so not sure if a guy caan park there-not much room and didn't see tow vehicles on grounds yesteday. Only truck/trailer I saw was on shoreline to left of launch-occupying the one spot.  Where do you guys park-beer store or is there a lot down shoreline I didn't see?  May be moot as we planned a 3 day weekend end of July and now owner emailed me that someone wants to rent for week so I must match price so he doesn't ""loose money""-Nice! Anyone with trailer/cottage vacant July 27-29 pm me."

They've built a beautiful new docking facility in that location for big cruisers passing thru town on the water, but have never built anything decent for guys who want to launch small boats to spend a day fishing. Not even a dock to tie up to once you launch your boat."
94470,aniceguy,2007-07-16 12:48:00,1094,there is a resort on the way to the lock to clear not a great launch but for 10 bucks you can drop the boat and park the truck
94524,Zamboni,2007-07-16 15:10:00,235,Thanks guys-I'll scout both out next visit....can't launch at Water St alone without a dock. They should sink 2 poles beside the existing 4' of cement jutting into lake there so we could tie up while moving tow vehicles.
