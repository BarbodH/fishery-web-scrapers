94408,aplumma,2007-07-16 10:14:00,6896,Well that just sucks Dawg it is one thing to spend money on a new shiney lure but to replace a major part of the boat just sucks.   Art

94419,lew,2007-07-16 11:02:00,12767,"Sorry for your lousy luck Glen, but it's good to know I'm not the only one that does foolish stuff around here  Don't put too much faith in that circuit breaker though, I have a similar one on my troll motor too, but it didn't do diddly to stop my motor from frying. I take Misfish's advice now and unplug my motor when I'm done for the day.  I didn't go as far as tossing mine on the compost heap though, I've got it sitting in the basement to remind myself to not do stoooopid stuff in the future"
94446,Whopper,2007-07-16 12:15:00,2174,Dang dawg and here I was queening about having to replace a impeller. I would have like to seen the wrestling match though  Whopper
