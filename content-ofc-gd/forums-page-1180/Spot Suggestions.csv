94596,Nemo,2007-07-16 17:50:00,727,Hi my cousin is in town from the UK for a quick visit and will be visiting folks near Horseshoe Valley just north of Barrie.  He was asking if there was a good spot to rent a boat and do a little fishing. He is an accomplished fly fisherman and has an 8ft flyfishing set up.  He is visiting BPS this afternoon and I told him to ask for suggestions from the staff in the fly fishing section.  I don't fly fish and don't really fish that area I was hoping some of you here could make some suggestions.  I was thinking maybe Waubashene or Couch but other than that???  Thanks in advance..

I suggested Lakair take the american plan for a day or two so I will see if he wants to travel that far.  I have been to big Caribou. Was good told him about that.  Any other recommendations in that area.
