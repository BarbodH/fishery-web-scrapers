We started off a little slow but the day picked up as we found some warmer water. The surface temps ranged from 47 to 54 depending on where we were fishing. Every rod in the program fired today with, the braided diver being the best of the bunch. Here a couple pics of the bigger kings we caught. One was close to 24lbs on my scale. All fish were released for another day.      We ended up 14-18 today with a 4 rod spread, a couple of bows but mostly kings between 11-18lbs.  Good luck to all anglers in week 2  Cheers Al www.alsadventures.ca"

94502,ilario,2007-07-16 14:20:00,166,"actually, the sizes seem to be down again this year.. lake O is still the BEST salmon fishery on the Great lakes but the fish sizes (and numbers) have been declining since the early 90's. Fortunately, it appears that the slide is levelling off...hopefully..."
