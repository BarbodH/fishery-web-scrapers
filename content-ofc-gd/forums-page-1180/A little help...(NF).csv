94547,Stoty,2007-07-16 16:09:00,2910,"Hey everyone,  I wouldnt normally do this, but I noticed a thread a few weeks ago about a guy looking for work because he got screwed over by his employer. This same thing just happened to me today. I just finished a nice big project for them, and BAM, out I go.  Talk about a slap in the face.  Anyways, just wanted to see if anyone knows of any IT (preferably web design) related positions anywhere around the GTA? I have lots of experience with Web design/programming as well as Network administration.  Any help would be very much appreciated. PM or email ([emailÂ protected]) me if you know of anything, and I will send you my resume.  Again, I appreciate any help."
