I know some of you don't mind the cooler weather but I like some heat at this time of the year! After a long cold winter, we need some heat... I consider turning on my furnace this AM. It was chilly in the house. I can't recall that ever happening in July. We rented a cottage at Sandbanks in early August. I just hope it's warm enough to swim by then...  Global warming eh!??"
94088,aplumma,2007-07-15 13:10:00,6896,Seem to be nice and warm here........Come to the dark side Luke.   Art
94094,glen,2007-07-15 13:39:00,2641,The way the skies look there is a chance of lightning every day.   I got caught in a storm with the boat on tuesday it was real bad and i couldnt fish after i drove 2 hrs to the lake.
94097,JFR,2007-07-15 13:47:00,498,want some cheese and crackers with the whine?
94105,Rich,2007-07-15 14:38:00,3927,"I dunno, I kind of enjoy being comfortable while I fish. If my shirt isn't sticking to me and the fish are biting, well thats even better."
94116,jediangler,2007-07-15 15:30:00,1923,I'm with Rich on this one. If it never got above 25C I would be a happy camper. Might have something to do with the fact that it is close to 50C where I work.
94117,glen,2007-07-15 15:44:00,2641,The temps are ok.  I just dont like the lightning.
94118,Dutch,2007-07-15 15:49:00,831,I prefer the warmer temperatures.. not much point in having a pool we're not using.
94124,lunkerbasshunter,2007-07-15 16:10:00,2585,"i love this weather!  You can go fishing, golfing walking without worrying about getting heat stroke and liek rich said your shirt sticking to your skin.  I wish all year round it was 22 degrees out.  Cheers!"
94135,carp-starter,2007-07-15 16:58:00,253,"Just like jediangler, I would be a happy a camper if the temperature never got above  25C. So far it has been OK except for a 3 day period when it was over 31C and high humidity. Until July 26, the temp is to be below 25/26C. But the problem with next week is that the humidity will be high and so it will feel like 30 to 34C for the next 5 days.  If it is a bit cool for some, you can always put something on. But when it is hot and humid, you cannot do much even when you are in the shade.  carp-starter"
94193,aplumma,2007-07-15 21:01:00,6896,Sweat.....drink......sweat ......drink man how can you not love it when it gets hot. We hit the river and fished and floated in innertubes then back up in the boat for more fishin. Can I get an Amen from the Southern continguency??    Art
94194,crappiesteve,2007-07-15 21:07:00,220,"AMEN,Art is this what you were looking for from the northern contingency  Steve"
94202,Greencoachdog,2007-07-15 21:37:00,8163," Amen Bubba! I won't lie, we've had a fairly mild summer here with highs only around 30 (85) which aint bad at all for this part of the country... by now it's usually gettin' real close to 40 (99-103) here, but we still have 2 1/2 more months of hot weather ahead (typically) and 4 months 'til our first frost."
94243,Beans,2007-07-15 23:32:00,3339,Awe yes...Summer of '07...I remember it well...3 days of real hot weather...nothin' to do but park me arse in front of the air conditioner and watch TV...kinda wished we got the 24 hour fishing show channel...
94269,bbog,2007-07-16 00:03:00,665,I'd be happy with fall temperatures year-round (if the Bass were still feeding up for winter   )
