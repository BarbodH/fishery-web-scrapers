94620,gforce,2007-07-16 18:19:00,63,We caught what I thought was a mooneye in the Humber river this weekend... ( actually snagged it in the eye... it died ).  It was football shaped and about 6 inches long. Silver and very irridesent.  Anyone catch one of these? 
94622,ADC,2007-07-16 18:25:00,82,"wow,  what section of the Humber did you catch it in?  cheers"
94623,ADC,2007-07-16 18:25:00,82,"wow,  what section of the Humber did you catch it in?  cheers"
94627,gforce,2007-07-16 18:28:00,63,In between the bridges ( gardiner & queensway )  Have you caught one before?  There were lots jumping and feeding on the surface.
94629,Zib,2007-07-16 18:29:00,369,I caught one that was about 12 inches in Lake St. Clair before. Didn't know what it was until a couple of years later. If my scanner wasn't broke I'd scan it so I could post it.
94630,tbayboy,2007-07-16 18:36:00,1497,We saw them at the leslie spit a few weeks ago in spawn mode  a couple groups of 3 or 4 chasing one other one right near the surface (in amongst the carp)
94633,Hooked,2007-07-16 18:41:00,891,"I have caught several in the Grand River by Wilkes Dam.  Also caught a fairly big one in BOQ one summer, probably just over a pound.  Thought it was a rainbow at first with all the jumping it did.  I found there tongue to be interesting, they have 2 teeth on them, qutie cool."
94634,bigfish1965,2007-07-16 18:44:00,3382,Sounds more like an Alewife.
94640,tonyb,2007-07-16 19:01:00,1637,"I would also agree with Rick, leaning toward it being  an Alewife   or Gizzard Shad   Mooneye is not really found in these areas...check it out:    It's good to know your fish  Tony"
94641,fishing,2007-07-16 19:01:00,167,Beautiful fish. I caught a few in Grand River last year. About 8 to 10 inches long.
94642,Mike Pike,2007-07-16 19:02:00,1332,"I fish for them in the Grand River in area of Caledonia and downstream.  A terrific fish and fun to catch on light tackle.  Pretty co-operative when other fish aren't.  Almost remind me of a small Jack, if anyone's done any pier fishing in Florida.  Some flyfishers enjoy hooking into 'em as well, cuz they're pretty fun on flygear.  Mooneye can be quite willing combatants when other fish aren't so they're popular for flyfishing casting practice."
94643,crappiesteve,2007-07-16 19:04:00,220,"Lots of Mooneye in the grand river,and are a blast to fish for with a fly rod.  Steve"
94648,gforce,2007-07-16 19:12:00,63,"no, not an alewife or gizzard shad...  i checked out those pictures...."
94652,Zib,2007-07-16 19:25:00,369,
94657,wallacio,2007-07-16 19:35:00,475,"G-Force, I can vouch for your ""catch"" of a Mooneye at that location.  There is a regular group of locals that fish the mouth of the Humber each year when the salmon are staging in late August through September and I have personally witnessed at least a few mooneye (definitely not alewife) snagged on spoons etc."
