94147,sea nymph,2007-07-15 17:43:00,8,I was in a tournament  last year on lake scugog where there was a 7.4lb largemouth caught. That same day i saw one that i would say was bigger but hard to tell in the water. Of course wouldn't bite. I have saw and caught many 6lbers and believe me this was much bidder. There is huge bass in there lots of vegetation and cover for them but a 10lber let's hope.
93502,fliptheslop,2007-07-13 00:17:00,112,"I was just tslking to someone who lives near erie and he said someone told him that an 11lb largemouth was caught on Scugog, anyone heard or know if this is true"
93530,lunkerbasshunter,2007-07-13 01:19:00,2585,if so it is a canadian record.  sure woudl love to see a fish like that!  Cheers!
93537,Greencoachdog,2007-07-13 01:48:00,8163,... preposterous!
93539,Rizzo,2007-07-13 02:02:00,4754,"nah, it was a 2 lb bass with a 9 lb ski clamped down on his tail"
93544,bucketmouthjohnny,2007-07-13 02:22:00,115,"I hear guys tell me they catch 10 -14 lb buckets almost at will in local areas, pass the salt please   i try not to talk to these guys too much.    I am sure there are a few hawgs in southern ontario that might be 10 pounds but with today's technology i am sure there would be a newspaper article, biggest bucket i have seen was around 7 1/2 pounds in a tourney no less. sure would like to see a pic!!  ps, maybe it was one of them floating carp in scugog that was 11 lbs"
93563,Dutch,2007-07-13 03:42:00,831,"Highly doubt it.  I saw a 7 Lb 8 oz. LM bass and it was a monster that looked like a football.  Eleven pounds would be mammoth, but not in our climate.  Might be a good fish story though...."
93565,Sherriff,2007-07-13 03:45:00,252,"It was me, I caught it but I released it and my batteries died!!!!!!  LOL  Sherriff"
93603,Jigger,2007-07-13 11:26:00,1237,"A lady got a 10lbr out of a small lake in Muskoka last year. I think Karl Kalonka also caught one last year, it was up on the Extreme Angler website at one point."
93605,Roy,2007-07-13 11:33:00,13728,I think our very own Lew caught a very respectable LM while muskie fishing a while back. I don't think Lew weighs fish but that fish was at least 7 pounds.
93606,yellowboat,2007-07-13 11:35:00,211,I heard it was 9 something.
93722,lunkerbasshunter,2007-07-13 18:48:00,2585,"i believe there are 10 pounders out there, longer growing seasons from the warmer temps may produce more then we think. However i woudl be surprised if a 11 pound bass came from a lake that gets as much fishing pressure as scogog.  anyways i still would love to see an 11 pound bass anywhere in ontario, most likely if a fish like this exists a musky guy will catch it fishing with thsoe huge baits they use.  Cheers!"
93723,ricoboxing,2007-07-13 18:52:00,398,"that was me who caught it. best of all i was in my kayak.  sorry no pics, and released boat side."
93750,lookinforwalleye,2007-07-13 20:06:00,4399,"That would be something to see, there are probably huge Bass in Scugog on the right side of the causeway that have never seen a bait!"
93771,lunkerbasshunter,2007-07-13 20:40:00,2585,is the right side of the causeway a fish santuary?
93776,lookinforwalleye,2007-07-13 20:47:00,4399, I don`t belive so but it is private property.
93788,Joey,2007-07-13 21:33:00,9122,"Well Paul caught one close to, if not 11 lbs, in a small, very low pressured lake, and I seen it with me own eyes.  So they are out there, eating all those rock bass and layin low  Joey"
93798,danbouck,2007-07-13 22:01:00,4380,So with all these people catching these 11 pounders where are the pics or why isn't it a new record?
93805,Joey,2007-07-13 22:55:00,9122," Well Paul's had an unfortunate yet funny incident happen to it.  We didn't have a fish scale at the cottage, but had a human weight scale.  So Paul stood on the scale, weighed himself, and then stood on the scale with the fish, and it was 11 lbs more.  So we put it in a cooler full of water, drove to his parents house (his dad wasn't home at the time) to see if his nephew, who lived there and is also an avid fisherman, had a fish scale.  He did not but said he had a legal scale at work and would take it there.  We also did the human scale trick there too and again, 11 lbs.  We were psyched.  Ontario record here we come.  So the next day I called his parents house to find out about the weight of the fish and Paul's father answered.  He had just gotten back from a trip to Poland.  I said ""Did you see the fish"" and he said ""Yes, it was very, very big, but it tasted terrible.""      I said ""What, you ate it"" and he replied, ""I thought you brought it for me to eat, like you always bring me fish, but it tasted like mud.""  Well its no wonder it tasted like mud     So, that is what happend to Paul's Ontario record Bass and he has not caught one that big again (not for lack of trying).   Joey"
93825,mepps,2007-07-13 23:47:00,1301,I wouldnt be surprized to see a 10lb+ bass out of Scugog - you just never know!
93859,Daplumma,2007-07-14 01:40:00,1961,LOL
93860,Beans,2007-07-14 01:41:00,3339,"Just for clarification...the south side of the causeway is all private property...several well-to-do Torontonians purchased the whole swamp for their own pleasure...  Way back when a Mr Purdy built a dam and mill at Purdy Mills (200+ years ago...renamed Lindsay Ontario 150 years ago) and was allowed to flood 65,000 acres of land along the banks of the Scugog River...that became Lake Scugog...  Because our farm extended out under the water, my grandpappy used to run a trap line for muskrats and mink in the winter...  Don't know all the details of the land purchases but it all belongs to the private club now and they keep it well patrolled in case anyone is thinking of dropping a boat or canoe in there..."
93877,OhioFisherman,2007-07-14 02:25:00,6623,"Possible, but for reports like that I like to see a picture. 10 pound bass is a good bass anywhere, never saw one much over 7 here except in pictures. Some lakes that get a lot of pressure can still produce big fish, some can`t or don`t. I think Lew`s was 8lbs, a real nice fish."
93880,cityfisher,2007-07-14 03:04:00,959,biggest LM ive seen was my bros 6.4lber.... I caught a SM at almost 7lbs but there is a good amount of them on simcoe... 8-9 are rare !
93892,Dutch,2007-07-14 04:49:00,831,  Ha ha.... that sounds like one of the fish stories I was talking about in my post earlier in this thread....not that I doubt it though.
93975,addict,2007-07-14 21:23:00,475,11lb out of stinkbog somebodys been eating lead jig heads.if the said they caught a tire or piece of an ice hut or 11lb clump of weeds i might believe them.
