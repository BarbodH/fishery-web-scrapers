87577,Zamboni,2007-06-25 19:43:00,235,"Added some new charts recently to the ones I made available for dl last year. Lakes Rosseau and Joseph are now there along with the Ottawa River starting at Carillon Dam all the way back to Ottawa. We can't openly post the dl links in forums here but anyone wanting the updated list just pm me. All of the Kawartha lakes were already there along with Bay of Quinte and Georgian Bay charts, I'll update list again when I find time to scan in more.  To be clear, charts are a free download-few guys pm'd asking."
