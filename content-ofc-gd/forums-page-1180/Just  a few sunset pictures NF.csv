92493,nautifish,2007-07-10 15:39:00,1416,I have taken over the past two weeks at a lake i have been fishing right across the street from me. As a few of you know i love to take photo's and sunsets as you can see are my favorite.              This one is of the beach here in dover taken a little over a week ago.

92499,bigbuck,2007-07-10 15:54:00,2449,"Nice pics, you have a good eye for framing pics. You should try to sell a couple to a post card company, you might actually get paid a few bucks for doing something you love to do."
