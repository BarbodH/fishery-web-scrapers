Spent a few hours there with fake salmon eggs, flys and bass stuff.  We tried to get some worms along Lakeshore.... no luck.... so we said ""We will give it a go anyways!""  So, we went under the bridges at the mouth of the humber. Again, casting etc... the water was like 4"" of visibility.. no luck!  So, we moved towards Lake O. ( between the lakeshore bridge and the freaky foot bridge on the west side ) and dropped some jigs tipped with a fake salmon egg.  Casting and bumping the bottom slow!  Right at the break wall, I got a huge tug and figured it was a carp and I was right. I was using a light action set-up with 20lb Power pro with a 12lb flurocarbon leader. That sucker fought for 15 minutes!  I hand landed the monster and I figured it was over 25lbs. Monster!  My friend was next. He figured it was a snag at first until it started swimming. I showed him how to use the drag on his reel. His rod was bent right over and he was freaking out with excitement. A few onlookers stopped to watch as he battled his fish.  He had 8lb. mono....  Yes, it broke off after 5 minutes ( i figured weeds or a rock ).  He was shaking with excitement and now he wants to return another day to land his first fish!  Thanks for the hints from the GTA folks out there!"

94600,gforce,2007-07-16 17:52:00,63,Probably going again tonight.....  Hopefully get some more!
94763,lazybum,2007-07-16 23:18:00,142,It's the adrenaline rush you get that makes you want to go back for more.  Big fish on light gear is quite exciting. Good luck tonight.
