94404,misfish,2007-07-16 09:59:00,29133,"Thanks everyone for your replys and comments. Like I had said it was his day ,and it was a blast."
94409,Roy,2007-07-16 10:15:00,13728,"Great memories for sure, Brian. Good on ya.  ps. Can you get Terry one of those shirts?"
94415,mart,2007-07-16 10:42:00,93,"Brian, Good report on you and your son's experience with his first tourney. You'll both remember that day forever.I can't wait for my boy to get older so he can experience one too. Good results for tough conditions. That rain just never stopped. We ended up 16th and just out of the money(0.04 oz.)and lost a 5lber at the boat  . Well at least Team Ko-Man-Chi was well represented at Sparrow. It was a zoo at the launch and we never got to meet so maybe next time.Congrats on the results and enjoy those memories with your son!!!!! Marcel"
94416,misfish,2007-07-16 10:45:00,29133,Yeah that launch was a CF.  Nice finish aswell. Nice to see large field to allow for more pay outs Marcel.  Nice decal on the truck btw.
94420,lew,2007-07-16 11:10:00,12767,"Brian, I thought you were fishing a tourney on Chemong or the tri-lakes  this weekend after your questions about it last week. I passed the ramp Saturday morning and it was empty, so then I thought maybe you launched somewheres else and I checked out every red bass boat I saw on Upper Buck & Pigeon.  If I hadn't been so busy lookin for you all day I may have caught more fish myself"
94431,misfish,2007-07-16 11:29:00,29133,"Nope,I will be up there in a few weeks Lew. Just doing some home work."
94467,ccmtcanada,2007-07-16 12:45:00,7971,Fantastic report Brian!!!  Wow...20 boats at the launch...that would be the time I pick to do something really dumb...good thing I dont own a boat...LOL.  You guys had a great day out there...middle of the pack finish is very respectable.  Great job and pics!
94487,fishnsled,2007-07-16 13:48:00,3520,EXCELLENT report Brian!!!!    You may have not been in the money but a successful day regardless.
94503,Mark Kulik,2007-07-16 14:20:00,348,"Good job Brian, Sparrow can be a tough lake, great to fish with your son, can't wait for my 2 little guys to get a bit bigger, but they are well on their way, watching them on Sun. on Simcoe, was a blast good luck on the next one!  are you fishing Muskoka?"
94506,misfish,2007-07-16 14:26:00,29133,Yes I will be there both days this weekend. Hope to see ya there.
94533,bigbuck,2007-07-16 15:40:00,2449,"Nice!! You guys had some fun and that's what counts the most. Once the two of you find your groove, we'll see you with the big fat cheques."
94742,misfish,2007-07-16 22:39:00,29133,"Having a chance to read all the replies after a long weekend,I have to say thank you for all your replies.It,s been a so real weekend fishing two days and having my boy with me,although sunday he fished with someone else.With him joining up with a club with me,it will be a some sort a pro/am,learning the ways of the bass.  Thanks again all.  Take yer kid fishing.You wont regret it. It dosent have to be competitive,just take them out and spend time together.     Time goes by WAY TO FAST."
94751,lew,2007-07-16 22:55:00,12767," Truer words were never spoken Brian.  After my son died a couple years back, my daughter decided to become my new fish'n partner and it's been a VERY enjoyable experience for both of us.  She's in her mid 30's now but was never a fisherman.....er, fishergirl......yet she caught on fast and now we hit the musky waters together and have a great time. Whenever the fish hits my bait, I set the hook, then pass the rod to Sheri to let her have the fun of the fight. When it grabs her bait, I watch her as her smile broadens with each passing second  She's getting really good at fighting the fish and is a very fast learner.  I now plan my fishing trips around her and it's something we both look forward to every week.  As Brian says, folks, take your kids fishing !!"
94165,Bassman27,2007-07-15 18:42:00,98,"That's great,Congrats on a good day with your son.Bass can frustrate the heck outta ya sometimes especially in the derbies.  BM"
94223,TJQ,2007-07-15 22:41:00,7806,Atta boy!!!!!  a great day with the boy!!!  nice shirts!!
