94372,danbouck,2007-07-16 02:52:00,4380,Went back out to Shades Mill today for a few hours. My son has already been for a few boat rides but this is the first time that he grabbed a fishing rod and wanted to do what I was doing. Can't wait until we can both go on weekend fishing trips!       Next year we will both be slaying the panfish
