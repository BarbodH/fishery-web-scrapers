94071,Jen,2007-07-15 06:00:00,833,Glad to hear you are finally bringing some fish into the boat... Be safe see you in a week! Then we are out as often as possible... I have a ticket I don't want to waste...  Cheers and catch something big !  Jen

94091,Mike the Pike,2007-07-15 13:20:00,3421, Way to go Sonny a 21 pounder is a nice fish .Glen can all he wants but we haven't seen a southern report from him in such a long time  I will be taking my kids dock fishing at my Dad's camp today I will be sure not to forget the camera.  MTP
94351,Beans,2007-07-16 02:23:00,3339,"  Glen...you're beginning to sound like Meely...  ""Did you get it in the boat?...Nope?...then it's only a story""..."
94355,Greencoachdog,2007-07-16 02:31:00,8163," Now let's see... I caught a big one and it got away... the batteries died in my camera/forgot to take the camera,I unknowingly burnt up my trolling motor, my wife said if I went fishin' one more time she would kick my butt, my dog ate my homework...  Come take my place in the 40' deep excavation and I promise I'll go fishin' and file a report Mike."
