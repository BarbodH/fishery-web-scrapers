The man produces his and the warden asks the woman where hers is.  She replies ""I'm reading a book I'm not fishing"".  The warden then tells her she has all the right equipment with her in the boat.  She tells the warden ""Then I'm going to lay sexual molestation charges against you"".  The warden says he didn't sexually molest her.  She tells the warden "" You have all the right equipment with you too don't you?  Lol"
