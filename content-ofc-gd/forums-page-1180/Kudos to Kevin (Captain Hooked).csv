I emailed Kevin and told him my plight.  Well he got ahold of a friend of his who has a cottage near there and lives in Thornhill.  His friend brought down the pike and I went and picked it up on Tuesday.  We had it tonight for dinner and it was delicious.  So thank you Kevin, you da bomb!    Joey"
