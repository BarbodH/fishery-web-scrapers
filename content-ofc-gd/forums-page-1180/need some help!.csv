94577,Whopper,2007-07-16 17:16:00,2174,You can take a Qtip and swab the inside of the suspected rod tip and if any cotton is left on the tip you can just replace the rod tip itself. To remove tip heat with a lighter and pull straight off with a pair of plyers. To replace just find the right size tip for your rod and buy some rod glue and replace tip. Shouldn't cost more than five bucks and it will be good as new. I always keep a stick of glue and extra rod tips in my tackle box for emergencies. Have you dad help ya with this please.  Good luck  Whopper

94580,Bly,2007-07-16 17:20:00,1556,"  The top eye can be replaced, usually without too much trouble.  You can purchase a kit or you can take it to your local tackle shop, most will do it for you for only a few $$.   If you continue to get a lot of breaks try switching the line to PowerPro....between the 2, I have fewer troubles with PP.   Bly"

94584,Whopper,2007-07-16 17:25:00,2174,Your welcome little angler! Any decent tackle store will carry what you need and if your not sure just ask someone working there. Fuji make a little kit for tip repair that comes in handy!  Whopper
94585,Whopper,2007-07-16 17:26:00,2174, Hey Roger I'd say BPS is a decent tackle shop
