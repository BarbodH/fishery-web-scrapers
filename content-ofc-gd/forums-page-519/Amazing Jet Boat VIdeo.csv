598297,craigdritchie,2011-06-30 15:27:00,1586,"This just has to be shared with the world - click here to watch an 18 foot jet boat go ripping up a BC river, bouncing over rocks and logs, scraping through riffles that are barely ankle deep. It gives a whole new meaning to running a boat in shallow water!  (Admin - sorry for the redirect, not sure how to show a video in a post)."
598302,DRIFTER_016,2011-06-30 15:59:00,10439,"Yep, they be pretty cool until you get em stuck. Just make sure you have a portable winch, parachute, hi-lift jack, a couple of soccer or basket balls, come along, a shovel and axe for when it does happen."
598304,mercman,2011-06-30 16:13:00,7054,"Nice, but its not a hovercraft. Do that often enough, and you wouldnt have a bottom left on that boat.  "
598307,Roy,2011-06-30 16:22:00,13728,That'll buff right out.
598308,SmokestackLightnin,2011-06-30 16:27:00,390,"Great, now people who buzz the shallows and go crazy on Jet Skis can now take their art to a new level and start moving further upstream and into back lakes as well as swamps and marshes."
598311,LucG,2011-06-30 16:52:00,779, My exact thoughs...
598316,NAW,2011-06-30 17:10:00,4022,I do that in my 14' tinner all the time..
598319,DRIFTER_016,2011-06-30 17:23:00,10439," Try that on a jet ski and you'll just punch a hole in the hull. The hull on that jet boat is aluminum and 3/8"" thick UHMW  while the jet ski is 1/4"" fiberglass. The UHMW is practically bulletproof!!!"
598322,craigdritchie,2011-06-30 17:41:00,1586,Uh huh ... first contact would rip the bottom off it. That's why this boat is so unique.
598323,Terry,2011-06-30 17:43:00,14456,"my folding boat with a jet drive motor does the same thing  plus my boat floats in 4"" of water"
598326,SmokestackLightnin,2011-06-30 17:48:00,390," That's right it would rip the bottom off a jet ski. So now, the machines the jet skiers can purchase are indestructible and they can drive them further into the hinterland and disrupt places that have never been disrupted before."
598327,Roy,2011-06-30 17:55:00,13728," Hell that's nuthin', mine can float in hundreds of feet of water!"
598328,Spiel,2011-06-30 17:55:00,9065,I need one for Bronte Creek.
598329,Headhunter,2011-06-30 17:56:00,5703,Looks like I am going to have to upgrade my sling shot... aint now way my old one is gonna penetrate that hull! HH
598334,Terry,2011-06-30 18:17:00,14456," LOL  I don't like going any deeper the 6"" after that it could sink"
598338,smally21,2011-06-30 18:39:00,993,"mother nature screamed in horror the whole time, but i quite enjoyed the video. i could see this boat being good for ice break up, and maybe emacerating less stream fauna along the way.  great pics on the blog craig."
598351,DRIFTER_016,2011-06-30 19:24:00,10439,"You can use them in water that is deeper than 4"" too. I found this video earlier this month whilw searching around youtube. Me thinks people that live in Idaho may be a few fries short of a Happy Meal, don't you? "
598391,tb4me,2011-06-30 23:00:00,3295,LOL that is insane..I guess big balls are somting they shouldnt have...
598393,Tybo,2011-06-30 23:08:00,1373,Better then the old school way.         
598465,SRT8 smoker craft,2011-07-01 03:13:00,1107, This is my Yamaha which Yamaha are you
598472,hawk-eye,2011-07-01 04:38:00,141,That would be the marine version of off roading. Cool vid thanx for sharing.  As for the second vid I think they might also be missing the burger and soft drink from that happy meal.  Great vids.
598481,Whitespinnerbait,2011-07-01 09:03:00,2038,I want one of those  :worthy:
598684,Jer,2011-07-02 11:33:00,1426,   You must have been real upset when the float-plane was invented...
598688,SmokestackLightnin,2011-07-02 12:20:00,390,"  The price of a plane and the skill required to fly it keeps the numbers down.  Besides, the bush pilots I know have a great respect for the outdoors and those they share it with."
