598657,Cudz,2011-07-02 04:04:00,2652,"Got up early and went fishing for the morning  Jaydub came too.  Very busy and a good day.  I finished with 17 smallies and Jaydub caught 8. Biggest fish was my first smallie of the day and weighed 4.01 pounds.  7 mins later I tangle with a 3.5 pounder.  After that, no real big fish but very fun.  Water was so clear I literally saw 40-50 bass this morn  Pic of Jaydub's fish   Pic of little fish but cool tshirt   3.5 pounder  4.01 pounds "
598673,Roy,2011-07-02 08:30:00,13728,Great crop of smallies there for sure. Water looks like it couldn't get much calmer except for some places near shore. Thanks for the pics.

598691,Live2fish85,2011-07-02 12:45:00,1633,Nice going those are some nice smallies.
598714,Cudz,2011-07-02 14:18:00,2652,lol! Lemur tail only stayed on for 3 days (despite my youngest daughter's pleas to keep it on forever)
598716,NAW,2011-07-02 14:23:00,4022,"It was a beautiful day out there.  I was out downrigging till our motor started to act up, then went for bass.  We saw a few, one had to have been over 5.  But could get any to bite.. Managed a few perch, and that was it.  Looks like you guys had a great Canada day.  The launch must have been a nightmare.."
598722,Cudz,2011-07-02 14:49:00,2652,launched at 5:15 am nobody there.  Left my boat at a friend's house on the water so did not have to take it out.  GOing to get boat now. I dropped Jaydub off at the launch around noon and it was insane.  Glad I did not have to deal with it.
