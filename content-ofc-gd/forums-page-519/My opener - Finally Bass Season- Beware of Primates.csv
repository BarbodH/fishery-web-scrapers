598075,GBW,2011-06-29 21:52:00,8460,"now aren't you glad you didn't make a skunk's tail?!?!?!  I can just hear your buddies now ""nope, no skunk in my boat, go fish with...."""
598097,Fisherman,2011-06-29 22:40:00,7201,"I'd be careful wearing that thing, somebody that's not happy with raccoons might mistake you for a ring tailed bandit and cap yo   ."
598126,SRT8 smoker craft,2011-06-29 23:46:00,1107,LOL nice fish and the beard made me laugh my   off
598194,Jigger,2011-06-30 02:28:00,1237,Nice fish man! Nothing like beating a pb on opening weekend! Looks like you woke up on the wrong side of a good night...
598197,sleepjigging,2011-06-30 02:38:00,207,My family is reading your post and are in a heated debate as to whether you grew that in a weekend? Very original. It's a work of art.  Jiggy
598216,Cudz,2011-06-30 03:43:00,2652,That is the plan next time I do this. Shave a lemur in the hair on my head and have it turned so the tail is where my beard starts.  this was the second time I grew this beard.  If you look closely at the pics you will not that the beard where I am holding the fish is not the same as the pic of me with the beard but without the fish.
598218,Cudz,2011-06-30 03:55:00,2652,Yes.  Hulkster was last year.  I already have a good one for next year  Same lake.  The other boat also managed 7 walleye in one evening. I love that lake.  I always do well there.  Constant action if you throw the right lures in the right spots.    Parade??  What parade are you talking about?  Is there a Primate parade I should be aware of? I think Ford will be a great mayor. I grew the beard for 1 week. I then shave it in which takes about 15 minutes.  After that it take 3 sessions of 40 minutes each to get the dye (some crazy bleach) to work.
598222,ctranter,2011-06-30 04:11:00,543,Lookin good.  The extra detail on the stash should drive the bass crazy
598276,cityfisher,2011-06-30 14:11:00,959,Nice fish and sick beard! hardcore!
598414,BillM,2011-07-01 00:57:00,17367,"That is the most badass beard I've ever seen, lol!!!"
598423,Daplumma,2011-07-01 01:15:00,1961,"Love the beard,looks just like my crazy coonass grandma!Nice green trout also. Joe"
597855,Cudz,2011-06-29 04:13:00,2652,"Boys weekend.  Same lake as the last 4 years.  Got out early on Sat morning and did well.  Caught lots of little largies on the frog and some nice little smallies on a senko.  Caught a bunch of pike but nothing big, just 3 pounders.  They really tear up my frogs and destroy my slammers on the drop shot and love tubes. Drop shotting with 8 pound fluoro is the worse method for catching pike (actually it works great to catch them, it is the landing that is difficult). lol. Caught a really really really strong 3.76 pound smallie.  What a fight. I always find that smallies in the 3-3.5 pound range are way more dificult to land than 5-6 pounders.  THey are really athletic and nuts. Caught a really big largie as well.  The pics don't do it justice and because I was by myself and forgot my camera I had to use my cell phone.  The largie is big and I weighed it.  I won't comment on its weight because I don't need the naysayers trying to tell me it isn't what I know it is. It wasn't long but it was really thick  And in case you were wondering, I am sporting a monkey tail beard in the pics (actually a ring-tailed lemur to be exact).  This is the second time I have had it.  It is sweet. lol Little largie  Nice little pike.  Lots of these this weekend  Little smallie. caught a bunch in this size  Big smallie.  3.76 pounds.  I guess this is why they are called black bass  Tied my canadian PB largie with this fish Check out his bug eyes   And of course the ring tailed lemur. One half of my face is completely shaved and the other has the monkey tail.  "
597858,Nipfisher,2011-06-29 04:26:00,2449, Ummmm...o.k. Great weekend though.
597859,RyanT,2011-06-29 04:39:00,72,Nice fish!  But the beard... did u lose a bet?  Just kidding.
597868,singingdog,2011-06-29 09:43:00,1047,Nice smallie. I would have guessed it was more than 3.76.
597875,beginner,2011-06-29 10:27:00,542,"nice fish dude, great report... beard was  awesome, looks like you went to Paris... those stripes shirt???"
597877,spinnerbaitking,2011-06-29 10:32:00,1622,"That's some nice Hawgs, I don't care how much you say it weighs SBK"
597878,solopaddler,2011-06-29 10:34:00,8605,"Okay, you must have lost a bet that's my guess.  Nice bunch of fish though!"

597902,Cudz,2011-06-29 12:05:00,2652,Wow are you serious.  It takes a real man to wear that out in public.  Are you man enough?
597903,Roy,2011-06-29 12:10:00,13728, Nope
597910,NAW,2011-06-29 12:19:00,4022,"Great weekend man.  If i remember correctly, this boyz weekend, you guys all grow a crazy stash.  Didn't you do the Hulkster last year?"
597913,Harrison,2011-06-29 12:27:00,2202,"Ok, fish are cool... but the stashe, come on dude.  Talk about creative, I hope you snagged the honors for the weekend with that baby.  Awesome!  I will not have alot of time to grow for my guys weekend, so I am going to go with the ""Balding caterpillar on my top lip"" stashe.  Well, that's what I am going to call it anywhoo."
597928,craigdritchie,2011-06-29 13:19:00,1586,I love it!! That definitely blows away the Hulkster. Gotta hand it to you man ..... that's original! Definitely makes a statement!

Which by the way is almost as good as the report...like it!  And i agree with your psychoanalysis of smallies......""NUTS""   Keep up the good work dude."
597994,johnnyb,2011-06-29 16:19:00,3413,"More crazy facial hair and great action from ""the same lake as last year""    Great fishery and you guys are really dialed into it....nice work!"
