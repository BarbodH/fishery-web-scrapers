I am bringing a boat with me.  My main target will be smallmouth and pike, but would love to catch a few walleye.  Any help would be much appreciated."

Also right near town is Basswood and little Basswood.  Big Basswood is predominantly smallies and lakers, while Little Basswood has smallies and pike. Closer to Blind River is Lauzon which is located on highway 17.  It has decent bass fishing.  Cheers."

Bright lake does having good fish in it, but as said is tough sometimes. There's always lake Huron that is a stones throw from Iron Bridge, and you can target whatever you'd like. Giver and catch some fish. When in doubt come to Elliot Lake"
