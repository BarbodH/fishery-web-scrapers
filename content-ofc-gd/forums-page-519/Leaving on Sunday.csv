598525,Gregoire,2011-07-01 15:26:00,1397,I'm getting excited for my trip to Lake Superior Provincial Park. I'll be there with a buddy for a week and I'm looking forward to portaging into a few back lakes. I'm going to start getting my gear together tonight. It's going to be tough to pack so light. Like many people I have a huge tackle addiction. I posted about this a while ago but if anyone has any updates or advice I would greatly appreciate it.
