597389,mercman,2011-06-28 00:14:00,7054,"Why is the console, or control area of a boat on the RH or starboards side? Car steering controls are on the LH side, so you would figure that is the way they would configure a boat as well."
597390,kickingfrog,2011-06-28 00:18:00,8333,This comes up every now and again. Always entertaining.
597393,mercman,2011-06-28 00:25:00,7054,So i should delete it now?
597394,shane,2011-06-28 00:27:00,652,If it was on the left hand side?  It just wouldn't be right.
597395,Terry,2011-06-28 00:31:00,14456,it is because of the rotation of the prop and the balance of the boat with one person in it with the older steering systems it made it tough to steer
597396,mercman,2011-06-28 00:35:00,7054,"Thanks Terry, that makes perfect sense. When i saw your name in the post, i said to myself, oh man.....here it comes"
597397,pikeguy,2011-06-28 00:37:00,195,"The origin of term comes from old boating practices. Before boats had rudders on their centerline, boats were steered by use of a specialized oar. This oar was held by a sailor located towards the stern (back) of the boat. However, like most of the rest of society, there were many more right-handed sailors than left-handed sailors. This meant that the right-handed sailors holding the steering oar (which had been broadened to provide better control) used to stand on the right side of the boat. The word starboard is a corruption of steering board, which in turn came from the old Norse language word stï¿½ri, in the language of the vikings.  Similarly, the term for the left side of the boat, port, is derived from the practice of sailors mooring on the left side (i.e., the Portboard side) as to prevent the steering boards from being crushed. Because the words portboard and starboard sounded too similar to be distingued under windy sailing conditions, portboard was shortened to port.  The starboad side of most naval vessels the world over is designated the 'senior' side. The officers' gangway or sea ladder is shipped on this side and this side of the quarterdeck is reserved for the captain. The flag or pennant of the ship's captain or senior officer in command is generally hoist on the starboard yard.  MODERN EXPLANATION "
597398,Terry,2011-06-28 00:38:00,14456,what are you saying            I don't always give a smart  answer
597399,vinnimon,2011-06-28 00:38:00,2593,  NO! I did see a practicle answer to this a while back.
597400,dave524,2011-06-28 00:41:00,4508, aren't tillers on the left side?
597402,misfish,2011-06-28 00:46:00,29133,"Terry is a smart    guy. You just have to fish with him to find out. Oh ,Im just a friend ,not his owner.  Im sure she (the owner),would have something different to say to this."
597419,mercman,2011-06-28 01:25:00,7054, Nothing at all I just thought i had left myself out in the open for a moment. I enjoy your answers Terry.Straight to the point...Bada bing Bada boom
597470,OhioFisherman,2011-06-28 03:19:00,6623,Try reaching across the boat while you are sitting in the drivers seat and grabbing the dock while trying to control the boat?
598148,skeeter,2011-06-30 00:35:00,1907,"So does this mean that boats with a center console, have a prop that doesnt spin ?"
598229,Dozer,2011-06-30 06:57:00,896,"Mercman, my question to you is, what did you tell her after she asked?"
598234,mercman,2011-06-30 10:56:00,7054,"  Told her i had no clue, and that you guys would be able to tell me."
598235,Handlebarz,2011-06-30 11:04:00,3790,  Paul was she as happy as my wife is when I tell her I have to check with OFC before I make some decisions that never goes well if its something she wants at the time and i want to wait and ask kinda like the Lap Top last week LOL.
598245,mercman,2011-06-30 11:55:00,7054,"  Your Honor, I refuse to answer that question. I do not want to incriminate myself."
598439,Rizzo,2011-07-01 02:06:00,4754, yup but people with tillers are a bit off balance as it is so the goofy engine doesn't make a difference
