598914,mike rousseau,2011-07-03 13:47:00,4661,Finally got the misses out in the boat for the first time this year... It took so long cause of the addition to our family... 7 week old Connor... So grandma and grandpa helped us out so we could spend the day in the boat...   So anyways... I decided to take her for walleye so she would be able to get a decent fish... And was I right... We managed 8 walleye between 2 and 5 pounds... She boated 2 and lost one and I managed 6 and a couple misses...  Then we had a nice lunch at a riverside restaurant and a beer or two... And when we got back on the water the weekend boat traffic on the Larry was brutal so we opted to pack it in early and pick up our son a bit early and BBQ some steaks...  All and all everybody had a great day and then our 7 week old gave us the gift of an 8 hour sleep... All and all... Best day of the year in my opinion...
