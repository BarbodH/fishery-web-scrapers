598717,NAW,2011-07-02 14:26:00,4022,I wish we had the same success as you!  What a bruzer.. Congrets to you guys!
598727,Sinker,2011-07-02 15:03:00,8692,"Nice fish James!! I'd be happy with one like that thru an 8"" hole in the ice   Nice to know they are in there. Did you take any measurements on it? How much you figure it weighs?  S."
598732,Guest gbfisher,2011-07-02 15:25:00,0,  We didn't measure it Shane....but I do know how much it weighed...
598746,Sinker,2011-07-02 16:36:00,8692,And......????  I'll say 28.75lbs. Am I close?? Probably over by a little.......maybe........hard to guess from pictures  S.
598806,Meegs,2011-07-02 22:09:00,249,"   close, it hit the 20lbs mark on the scale, then made sure we took our time to fully revive it!    was the best fight i've had with a laker i think ever!    been a good year for big fish out there, we've got 6 over 15lbs so far in the last few weeks!  all swimming for someone else to enjoy!  Sinker, let me know if you want to get out and have some fun for an evening in next few weeks!"

598857,misfish,2011-07-03 00:36:00,29133,"I got one as well James ,6 years ago or so. Theres a 30 plus out there no dought. Great fish again."

598920,lew,2011-07-03 14:01:00,12766,Probably 50 years since I fished for Simcoe lakers but I know for a fact we never saw anything even close to that brute.  Awesome fish !!
598551,Guest gbfisher,2011-07-01 18:30:00,0,Meegs with his fish. He's been on good size fish this spring. Went 4 for 7 in the three hours out there. Another guy went 8 for 16 but smaller fish. Still lots of fun.  
598552,davey buoy,2011-07-01 18:44:00,5505,"I think I know the area, off oro? Saw a lot of fish on the finder but my rope was only 100' long. Will have to add at least another 50'. Nice fish."
598553,kickingfrog,2011-07-01 18:44:00,8333,That is one solid fish. Great way to spend Canada Day.
598554,Spiel,2011-07-01 18:47:00,9065,That's a tank! Nice fish James.  I'm guessing it was trolled up and not jigged?  
598556,Guest gbfisher,2011-07-01 18:58:00,0,  Trolled ...yes. and deep.
598557,Grimace,2011-07-01 18:59:00,2020,What a tank!!!
598558,Spiel,2011-07-01 19:00:00,9065,  Sweet!  
598560,Terry,2011-07-01 19:11:00,14456,man that is a beauty
598562,Scott S,2011-07-01 19:19:00,203,WOW! What a nice fish. What was the lure of choice. I'm going to have to try that. Just mounted some downriggers on my boat. Scooter
598563,TDunn,2011-07-01 19:27:00,680,Awesome fish!! Wow!!!!!   TDunn
598564,Guest gbfisher,2011-07-01 19:29:00,0,  Meegs paints his own stuff and of course I forget the color of it...  I was just there to reel in his fish is all.  It's nice not having to do all the work for a change.
598567,spincast,2011-07-01 19:46:00,3279,WOW beauty fish
598571,BillM,2011-07-01 20:09:00,17367,That thing is an absolute tank!!!!

598582,Rod Caster,2011-07-01 22:10:00,5784,Deep water tank!!
598593,Joey,2011-07-01 23:01:00,9122,"What a brute, congrats"
598601,Terry,2011-07-01 23:28:00,14456, I think next winter on simcoe we will only fish for the big ones like that one
598603,dsn,2011-07-01 23:35:00,1018,Wow... I'm glad to see they still have monsters in there. The past few years I only see smaller lakers when I go ice fishing there. Thought there wasn't anymore monters in there. Glad to see the fishery is still thriving.    karper.
598609,LefroyFisherman,2011-07-01 23:47:00,602,Huge! nice catch
