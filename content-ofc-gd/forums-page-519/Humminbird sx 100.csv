It shows the depth at being 1000' plus. I have checked the position of the transducer ,still in the horizontal position as before. Any help would be appreciated,thanks davey."
598516,Fang,2011-07-01 13:52:00,1330,My bet would be you need a new transducer
598517,davey buoy,2011-07-01 14:18:00,5505,You don't think there is any reset to factory specs or any way to plain reset it?
598543,Woodsman,2011-07-01 17:57:00,1286,Not worth spending the $ for a transducer (most likely close to $100) on such an old model. A new $100 fishfinder would be a far better than your old one. Of course you could spend even more & get an even better one.
