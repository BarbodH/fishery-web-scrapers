Me and a few buddies were thinking of going camping somewhere before the end of july that has access to some relatively good fishing right next to where we set up camp. Doesn't really matter what kind of fish are there as long as its not panfish  and the fish are edible. We live in newmarket and dont mind driving 2 hours or so away.   Thanks in advance Mike!"
