598153,MJIG,2011-06-30 00:39:00,227,"Speaking from past experience, I can tell you that: - taking steps to exclude your place is the ONLY way to permanently get rid of the problem (the right-angle buried screening and one way door, fixing up or repairing whatever has allowed them entry, etc.) - Forget the mothballs as raccoons have absolutely no reservations in picking them up and getting rid of the foul smelling things just as you would. Skunks aren't as adept at that kind of thing, so they are probably more effective with them. Also, you'll have to put up with the smell of the mothballs too if you go that route, and you will get tired of it it is close to your house.  Just eliminating the particular raccoons that are currently there (fatally or other means) is ineffective in the long term. Why? Because the next wandering raccoon will move in using the same technique as the one you just got rid of, and he/she knows it's a good spot because he/she can smell the den of the former occupant (industrial strength deodorizers can help a little there).  Use the exclusion approach always. If you want to add in your eradication method of choice as others have suggested, go ahead, but always combine it with a way of sealing off and excluding the entrance to their den.  Each female usually has at least three youngsters each summer, and each of them will heading out on their own before next spring to find their own den sites too. Do the math and shudder.  I sincerely wish you luck.  --"

598199,ChrisK,2011-06-30 02:43:00,2772,Not sure if anyone has mentioned this yet but when I had skunks under my shed I simply put a getto blaster through a hole I made in the floor and cranked heavy metal at them for a couple days until they couldn't take it any longer and left. Like raccoons they have sensitive ears and if your neighbors can take it for a day or two without calling the cops its a great way of making them move on to live under someone else's deck

He asked if he could borrow it cause a racoon was trapped in his attic above his kitchen and he wanted to kill it. So of course I went to his house with him. He crawls up and started to unload at it.Plink plink plink and all of a sudden I heard a screem and crash. He fell through the drywall ceiling and landed on the kitchen table on his back smashing it to pieces. The racoon jumped down through the hole and ran out the back door. He said he didn't even hit it once as he cold see very good. When he was shooting at it he hit a stud bracket and it ricocheyed back and hit him square in the middle of his forehead. He had a red dot and a bruise there for weeks. His also couldn't sit down for a week as his wife beat his ass when she got home and saw the mess and desctruction. I helped him put up a new sheet of drywall, and his wife got a trip to the brick for a new table and chairs."

598345,Big Cliff,2011-06-30 19:05:00,6899,"True story:! Just after I got out of the army a friend in Toronto invited me to go deer hunting with him up in French River. We loaded up the car and headed out for the weekend.  He was from the area and knew everyone (those from the area will probably remember Bill Ouimette). Anyway that night we needed a place to stay so he took me to some friends house. (the Mines Family on Hartley Bay Rd.)(Saddly the farm is now gone)  Now, this was all strange to me, there were about 9 kids running around, but the whole family made me feel like I was just part of the family. There was always enough food somehow to feed anyone that was hungry.  That night I got to sleep on the couch in the living room (there were a few couches and all ended up occupied, (one even had this cute red head, unfortunatly her boyfriend was sleeping on the other couch) everyone was welcome! So, everything is pitch dark, it is the middle of the night, and I wake up to feel a little hand going into my pocket.  Now, I think to myself, ""one of the kids is trying to steal my change"". So, I decide to scare the crap out of the kid and I grab the hand! I have no words to describe the next few minutes other than "" I grabbed, the hand had fir on it, it jumped, I jumped (about 3' straight up in the air)and screamed like a little girl, the whole house woke up!  They laughed about it for years after that. Turned out that they had rescued two baby racoons, Sam and Curosity (christ, they would rescue anyone and anything) which were supposedly kept in a pen in the basement.  Unfortunatly for me, they occasionally escaped and loved finding anything shiny and had figured out that shiny things came from peoples pockets. I just happened to be the first one they came to that night!  Oh, BTW, I later married that cute little red head and we had two wonderful children. Unfortunatly after 13 years together we ended up parting company but we are still to this day good friends and she'll still rescue anything that needs help!  I have many more stories about that time up in the French River but I'll save them for a later day LOL. Suffice to say it is a part of my life I'll never forget!  Next time you want a good laugh ask me about the night I stood out on the back porch in my underware in feb. with my rifle in hand and the wolves howling. Or the day I got home and my wife announced she'd shot a bear (with a .22)because it had one of her cats and it was in the bush across the road. ....... a lot of stories all true but some hard to believe!"
598361,mercman,2011-06-30 20:23:00,7054,"Cliff, i cant wait for the day we meet. I'm sure you could keep me entertained for a long time. Thanks for the chuckle  "
598392,Teressa,2011-06-30 23:04:00,55,"I do not say much in here as I was taught ""speak if you have something to say & not just to hear yourself speak"".  I am in here almost daily reading though. With that being said, here goes.  First off...Dad, yes the story of Sam & Curiosity raiding your pockets still gets told & laughed at LOL, Mom actually told Tara not that long ago when going through pictures, she found one of them!  My Mom does still rescue &/or feed the wild animals. At present she has about 5 racoons that come to her kitchen window and patiently wait for a slice of bread with margarine or some other goodie. They have not done any damage to anything since she started putting food out for them. Before she started putting food out, they did do some damage.  It's just the way she is, she will never change. My daughter has been helping her grandmother feed  & hand feed racoons and fox ever since she was about 2 years old. My daughter will be the first to tell you how a fox loves Mr. Freezies and Racoons love marshmallows. We have never in all the years my mom has been feeding them, EVER had any fox, racoon, fisher, martin, skunk...you name it...bite or attack anyone of us. You can say we got lucky, and sure, maybe with one or 2 we did, but not with all of them.  This isn't  a matter of running up to the first animal you see and shoving your hand in its face, the trust that has been built between humans and the animals was built over time.  As my Dad said, my Mom is a hunter, but just because she hunts doesn't mean she kills everything she sees for the hell of it.  Before some of you start ranting and raving about my post, let me just say this. Reading people tell others to ""accidentally slip and have a caged animal land in a lake or river""...now that I have calmed down...I will be polite and just say, you better hope I never come across any of you doing that as YOU may end up being the ones put in the cage and I ""slip"" and let the cage go into a body of water.  One of the first things I was taught growing up & hunting was you never let ANY animal suffer and you need to respect not only your firearm, but also the animals.  Either trap it, fence it out....hell even shoot it as others have said, but dont let ANY animal suffer. It isn't right! Just because it isn't a domestic animal (dog, cat or whatever) doesn't mean you have the right to torture, poison or drown it.  Teressa"
598404,solopaddler,2011-07-01 00:29:00,8605," Teressa that's a truly beautiful story, your mother sounds like quite a woman.  What you have to realize though is not everyone is interested is ""Dancing With Racoons"".  In many urban evironments they're incredibly destructive and filthy animals. In my case (and I happen to be a huge animal lover) they drove me and my family around the bend 'till the problem was solved."
598406,Big Cliff,2011-07-01 00:40:00,6899,"That's my girl! And believe me you sure don't want to piss her mother off! LOL. truth be told, my kids were brought up to respect every living thing, human or otherwise.  There are still pictures of my ex with a great horned owl sitting on her sholder, no leather pads or anything, no teather on the owl, just a wild animal and a human living in peace and respecting each other. Too bad more people can't respect others that way."
598409,Big Cliff,2011-07-01 00:45:00,6899," She isn't saying you should have to love it, just that if you do have to get rid of it don't make it suffer! Sticking it in a cage and drowning it is not the most humane way of dispatching it. Can you imagine what it would be like to be put in a cage then submurged and fighting to try to get a breath? Not something I would do to my worst enemy."

597970,Harrison,2011-06-29 15:23:00,2202,"Well, I'd be fencing off their enterance before they waddle up your driveway in the morn.  Or, to ensure no animals ever come in your backyard again just invite Misfish to sit on your deck."
597975,mistaredone,2011-06-29 15:36:00,913,I called animal control to get some coons out of my garage and they wanted $$$ and all they would do is release them outside my house to find thier way back in the next night.  Private guys were in the 4-$500 range and they can only by law drop them off 1km away.  From what I have been told a racoon will have a range of 10km.  My solution was to trap them one by one and drop them off in the country 15km away at the risk of a fine.  Making some davy crockett hats is another solution
597980,Flappn,2011-06-29 15:44:00,245,"Don't get why people want to save Raccoons. They are a massive problem and have be come invasive. Same with the coyotes. I can't hang a bird feeder in my back yard or else and it's happened many many times, I wake up in the morning and I have seen them hanging from it or the feeder is on the ground busted up...these are the feeders that are raccoon proof.  Over population of any animal is not good. Last year we had 9 rabid raccoons which the neighbor took care of. Farmers don't see raccoons as furry little critters. They see them as disease carrying pests. And that is what they are. Have a coyote bite into a rabid raccoon and now you have rabid coyotes roaming around, which isn't good for anyone.  We brought two of the rabid raccoons to the Ministry and the Ministry agent said we where nuts for even going near it. There is no worse animal than a rabid raccoon. They will rip your ankles off. Lets see a P3TA person change their tune when facing a rabid animal...which is happening more frequently these days with all the over population."
597983,craigdritchie,2011-06-29 15:54:00,1586,"Easy to get rid of them, and without risk of a fine.  First, go to Rona or Home Depot and buy some animal-proof screening (sort of like heavy duty chicken wire). You'll need enough of it to go all the way around the deck. You will also need a one-way wire animal door.  Dig a trench all around the perimiter of the deck, at least 8 inches deep and about 8 inches wide.  The screening comes in either a roll, or in long rectangular sheets, and is usually about two feet high. Bend it length-wise at a right angle, so it's now about 18 inches high and it has a lip that sticks out by around 6 inches. Position this screening along the facing of the deck, in the trench you've dug, so the lip faces out from the deck, and screw it tightly into the edge of the deck all the way around. Also screw it to the brick, where the deck attaches to the house. Then bury the base of the screen and stomp the earth down so it's well compacted.  That one-way door gets installed right where the beasts have dug their hole. Install it backwards, so they can get out, but they can't get back in. The lip that you buried prevents them from digging under the wire.  Raccoons and skunks usually have a couple of back-up dens elsewhere in the neighborhood. If it's too much effort for them to get back under your deck, they will go elsewhere. And, you'll never have to worry about them ever coming back."
597988,Sudzy,2011-06-29 15:58:00,88,"I was thinking trapping them and relocating might be the only permanent solution.  Was debating on whether to pick a trap up and do it myself, or give a professional a call on it.  What about placing a bright light under the deck, or a radio? Have read of some people doing that. Seems like it only might be a temp. solution though,  Going to look into the fencing, might be a good option. Thanks"

I had a problem with them in the past and have learned this much...they are protected and managed by the MNR - animal services will not do anything! -you cannot legally kill a raccoon without first documenting the damage the animal has made to personal property. This means pics, dates, times etc... -with proper documentation in place, you may live trap the animal and relocate it to a rural area and them put it down, but only on private property. (get a farmer to shoot it!) -if you are going to try and relocate the animal alive, you may only move it one km. This law is intended to stop the spread of disease.  May I suggest and only suggest, that you live trap the animal, take it down to your favorite body of water as a means of entertaining the animal, whilst in your custody. Some how or other, I always seem to trip, just as I get to the water's edge and the trap and Raccoon escape my grasp and fall into the lake!

I attacked them a few times with my hard rake and got a couple of vicious shots in.  They left and never came back.  My dad had a problem as well and resorted to trapping them.  He would actually spray their butts with orange spray paint so he'd know if the same ones made their way back to his property.  One day he trapped a big old gnarly one and put it in the back of his truck meaning to release it enroute to work. 'Course he forgot about it and it just so happened he was working in downtown Toronto that day.  Upon arriving he let the beast go in a parking lot behind a high end mens wear store then went inside the back entrance.  About 5 minutes later there was a huge commotion out front. Apparantly the coon (painted butt and all) was running up and down the sidewalk terrorizing the local yuppies.  My dad loves telling that story.

Here, a .22 and about 5 or 6 shells (depending on the size of the family) would probably be the prefered solution. We don't like to pass our problems on to our neighbours. (if you don't have a .22, then a mini G2G would work, BYOG!)  However, if you have a neighbour you don't like, a couple of cans of sardines dumped under their deck and a live trap for relocating your problem would probably work (not that I would ever do that, just saying).  The moth balls would work to keep them from staying around under your deck and be a lot less expensive and a lot less work than trying to put in a wire barrier. Try the esaiest solution first.
