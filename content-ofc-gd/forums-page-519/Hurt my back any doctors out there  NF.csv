598598,chessy,2011-07-01 23:12:00,610,"well i went and had xrays with my back and it showed nothing.... after 6 months of pain  i had a mir and it showed 3 non displaced fractures and 2 buldged disk and 1 perferated disk after that i had a nerv induction test and since that date i have had 5 mir and 3 nerv induction test and the nerv damage is perminate and deterorating... no offence but x rays are old technology. if your in as bad as pain as you say you are  DEMAND A cat scan or mir . you can not go back to work till your doctor says you can . your family doctor over rules the comp doctors ... you should have also had a nurse case manager assinged to your case.... by the way comp is very very slow giving money, they try to force you to go back to work when really you cant. i almost lost my house untill they found damage to back, now they cant do enough for me they sent me to university for retraining .... ..I am no doctor or wsib pro  i just know what i went through and can only tell you what i did ... once you get a comp number they will pay for mir and it will only take a few days to get one.... good luck..her exam was probably rolling from your heels to your toes right.... did she try to get you to turn foot in and out two...."
598628,Kawartha Kev,2011-07-02 01:59:00,281,"I know WSIB can be a pain in the ass, problem is my pain is in the back!!! My worst pain is getting up from sitting for any length of time and going up and down stairs I know work wants me back on modified duties right away but as I mentioned my family doctor is away until July 12 and he was the one who sent in the initial return to work forms. At the time he didn't know how bad it was or how I would respond so he just recommended meds and no work for 1 to 2 weeks and modified work duties after. My employer came back with come back to work a couple days later on modified duties immediately and when I went to show this to my doctor is when I found out he was gone from the office until July 12 just my luck.That's when it was off to the walk in clinic where the doctor examined me poked and prodded my back, made me walk and did balance tests and bending tests didn't do the rolling from the toes to heels you mentioned or turning of the feet I have had flat feet all my life and have had trouble with my feet off and on for years. Thanks for the response Chessy.  Kawartha Kev"
598706,chessy,2011-07-02 13:53:00,610,"well from what i know now . the reason the employer wants you back right away is every day your off they pay fines.   your family doctor is he in a medical center??? if so you are entiled to see one of the doctors in the center, my doctor never goes any were for that long with out having some one look after people that need it. call the ontario health office they will give you a list of doctors that your doctor is with"
598728,Kawartha Kev,2011-07-02 15:03:00,281,As I said before I have 2 family doctors that work out of the one office and when one is off the other covers the other guys patients not sure what happened for both to be off at the same time which is why I had to go to the Walk in Clinic I figured it would be faster than the emerg at a hospital. Things are feeling a little better but still not proper I am trying to get to see a friends of mine chiropractor who fixed him up when all the other doctors gave him no chance to walk again without surgery so we'll see what comes of that for now its the rest and exercises the physiotherapist gave me and more massage and physio on Mon. when I have to call my employer to let them know what is going on.  Thanks Kawartha Kev
598901,justinmch,2011-07-03 03:55:00,5,"Wow, sounds like you are in a lot of pain both physically and potentially financially.  I've had lower back problems from the time I was 18 until now and I'm 58.  Luckily I don't think I have any really serious damage.  I can control my problems with exercise and proper posture.  What I want to suggest to you is that you buy yourself a back brace at a building supply place.  They used to be really available, but I haven't seen a lot of them lately.  The won't fix your problem, but they will allow you to function a lot better.  For me they were a life saver.  You could get out of bed, do your business in the bathroom, put your socks on, etc., etc.  Try it.  You'll like it."
597191,Kawartha Kev,2011-06-27 15:03:00,281,Hurt my back last week at work lifting a heavy roll door any doctors here with any ideas to relieve the pain. Its my lower back that really hurts and is very stiff. I've been to the doctor who prescribed some muscle relaxants and some anti-inflamatories and suggested 1 to 2 weeks of no work and then modified duties after that so far its been almost a week with little change could use some suggestions if you have been through this pain of a bad back. Thanks  Kawartha Kev
597193,mike rousseau,2011-06-27 15:14:00,4661,Massage therapy...  My wife is a therapist and she has saved my back several times after injuries...
597195,chessy,2011-06-27 15:15:00,610, WOW ... if pain pills are not working  you may have slipped a disc. if the pain is no better in a week it probably is a buldged disc you may need a m.i.r to show it . if it is muscle relaxers will not work well you will need a nerve blocker. i have 1perferated disc and 2 buldged disc and nerv damage to my back i was on oxycotin and all sorts of other pain meds. i seen a pain specilist and he got me on a nerv blocker  there are lots out there just need to find the one that may work for you . good  luck your in for a long haul mabey
597197,Sinker,2011-06-27 15:23:00,8692,"Massage always helps mine too. I have a good chiropracter as well that helps alot, for me anyways.  S."
597198,Kawartha Kev,2011-06-27 15:26:00,281,I was thinking possibly a pinched nerve or something like that I already have tried several nerve pain killers for my troubles with my feet over the last year or so with no luck with them helping my feet. Have not tried the oxycontin or other big pain drugs don't want to get hooked on them this is a differant kind of pain from my foot pain which did have stiffness but they are extremely sensitive to touch and have tingling. This back pain is far worse not gonna be fun I expect. Thanks Kawarta Kev
597208,Garnet,2011-06-27 15:47:00,2056,Lay down on a bed get your wife or other to pull your legs straight. If 1 is longer than other head for the cruncher. Lay on your side pillow between legs pillow to keep head inline with legs. Every back is different bag of peas or corn sorry 1/2 bag right on the spot. Then hit it with heat Zellars has these bags you nuke.
597215,Headhunter,2011-06-27 15:59:00,5703,"Sorry for your pain... do you have pain in your hips or shooting down your legs? If not, likely you are dealing with a muscle issue, rather than a structural issue. If that's the case, you should be icing it on a regular basis.. stay away from heat! Be very careful with any or all exercises as you may irritate it more. Now, should you have pain in your legs, it's more than likely that you have some structural issues and those are best dealt with by professionals... and I don't mean Chiro or massage... neather will do you any good. Rx's only hide the issue... if you provide more deets on your symptoms, I may be able to provide more info. HH"
597235,Terry,2011-06-27 16:29:00,14456,I ask these guys about fishing problems..and do what they say  boat problems..and take their advise  but my health  I think I would go to that new thing they have in a few towns..now what is it called   oh yeah.   a doctors office.............
597240,mercman,2011-06-27 16:37:00,7054,"   Thats what i like about you Terry, no messing around. Tell it like it is. This is probably the best advise to give KK.  Paul"
597256,Kawartha Kev,2011-06-27 17:26:00,281,Thanks for all the replies everyone as some of you suggested go to a doctor I have done this and so far all he did was prescribe the drugs. I have tried the heat and cold without much success although the hot shower seems to help for a while. Right now the pain is so bad I wouldn't want to try much in the way of exercise or stretches as I can feel it as soon as I try to do too much will see what happens in another day or so then it will be back to the doctor to see what else can be done. Thanks Kawartha Kev
597257,Pikeslayer,2011-06-27 17:27:00,1443," You did report this work related acccident to your employer, right? And filled out a WSIB form 7? And you told the doctor it is a work related injury? BTW, if you're self employed, ignore the above.  Slayer"
597259,DRIFTER_016,2011-06-27 17:30:00,10439,  Kev If it is that bad go in to the hospital and get looked at. You may have to wait around a bit but they will be able to get you the tests you need in short order. If you go back to the doctor he will just give you a referral slip to go get the tests done. By going straight to the emergency room you will save a day or more!!!
597262,Kawartha Kev,2011-06-27 17:40:00,281,Yes Pikeslayer it has been reported to my employer and they have been told by my doctor about the 1to2 week time off and then modified duties not sure what they will be as my regular duties are of a labourer so it will probably be some kind of office work or something which won't help much as it hurts and stiffens up if I stay seated for too long.  Kawartha Kev
597265,Lunker777,2011-06-27 17:43:00,866," If you are still mobile, I wouldnt be to worried.  I threw my back out playing frisbee a few years ago... I had to take 3 days off work and I couldn't sit for longer then 20-25 minutes at a time. If your watching tv, or resting.... lay flat on your back, put a couple pillows under your knees... that will take any pressure off the lower back. When sleeping, as already suggested, lay with a pillow inbetween your thighs There isnt much in the way of midication I found that worked.... other then the over the counter muscle relaxers. Then ""helped"" but that was about it. Any time I was @ Home, I was flat on my back on the floor. It was the greatest feeling ever..... it really helps relief the pain. It took a few months for things to get back to normal. But I didn't even bother with the doctors because I knew it would be a LONG drawn out process! and on top of that... I knew they would initially just prescribe some pain relievers and send me home. I figured I am still mobile ... can't be that bad!  My advice, rest, ice/heat pad, some muscle relaxers to help with the spasms, and ride out the storm..."
597291,OhioFisherman,2011-06-27 18:55:00,6623,"I have no idea how things work up there, here companies send you to the company doctor, and since they are working for them? Their main concern seems to be reducing employer costs.  When I injured my back at work in 94 I was told it was muscle strain, after I took the x-rays that had been taken at the company`s clinic to a doctor selected by me? A herniated disc was clearly visible."
597305,addymark,2011-06-27 19:45:00,69,chiropractors are back pain specialists... easy choice..   just make sure you find one that will take the time with you to explain why you are in so much pain.
597340,Big Cliff,2011-06-27 21:24:00,6899,"Back pain and pills do not = an instant cure! You have damaged something and it will take time to heal. If you are still in pain after a week then go back and see your Dr.. Don't play games with your back, it could affect you the rest of your life!"
597348,Garnet,2011-06-27 21:37:00,2056,Guess I should explain. By checking witch leg is longer than the other. You will no how much your pelvis is twisted. This is also the first thing your chiropractor will do. Get a good one and you walk in 3 days.  My experience 30 years of back pain. Chiropractors are the fastest way to get working and living but I never go more than necessary.  Family doctor took 20 weeks 1 time for me. Not acceptable for me.

597526,Uncle Buck,2011-06-28 11:49:00,1000,"The only thing that will ""heal"" a back is a time...  and once you've thrown it out once, it can always come back...  i blew mine out a month ago bending over to turn the shower faucet off... and BANG i was incapacitated for a week... i could barely walk or stand  Good Luck!!"
598164,Kawartha Kev,2011-06-30 01:03:00,281,Well my back was not getting any better so it was back to the doctor but that didn't help as both my regular doctor's have gone on vacation until July 12 so it was off to the local walk in clinic. Not much better there having to sit around for an hour or more to get to see a doctor and be told pretty much what I already knew and was told to go to a massage and physio therapist so off to another doctor and another hour plus wait to get into to see the therapist. Another 10 to 15 minutes telling her what happened and assessment to tell me the same thing the other doctors told she then used a machine on me for about 15min.s of massage and then about 10 to 15 mins. of ultrasound followed up with a hot compress for 15 mins. I still don't feel like it has done anything to help going back for more of the same tomorrow and I think she wants to start some exercises. Of course the billing is gonna be fun as I don't have my claim papers yet my employer submitted to WSIB so I don't know if everything is approved or not and how much coverage I have from my work insurance and to top it off my insurance does not pay up front so I have to pay and get reimbersed later so who knows when that may be with the postal strike just being over and finally my employer offers me modified duties which at the moment I really don't feel up to doing but if I don't do them then it may be that WSIB won't cover my claim.  Sorry for the rant but it sucks being injured and having to jump through hoops to try and get better you'd think the priority should be on getting better and not having to worry about all these other issues.  OK I'm done with my rant thanks for listening.  Kawartha Kev
598504,Garnet,2011-07-01 11:49:00,2056,Go to a chiropractor 2 or 3 times then move into massage and exercise.  If you went last tues. you would be functioning by now. Doctors see you in sept.
598580,chessy,2011-07-01 21:24:00,610,call wsib and talk to your case manager . tell them what happened and who your employer is.. your family doctor is the one who tells you to go back to light duty or not.  tell him you want a MIR if you have a buldged disk. the chiropractor will mess u up even more ... i took my x rays to a chiropractor and he said nothing i can do for you .... if you have a buldged disc or a perferated disk your not going to like what they have to tell you .. your lucky your employer had light duty ...mine did not
598587,Kawartha Kev,2011-07-01 22:33:00,281,I tried to get a hold of my WSIB case manager but couldn't get directly in touch with her had to leave a message and never heard back from them only thing that I could find out about my claim was that the decision was still pending some medical info or something and like I said my doctors are away until July 12th and the one at the walk in clinic concluded it wasn't likely a nerve or disc problem from the exam she did on me most likely muscle strain so no Xrays were called for and then comes the holiday and weekend so more delays I am trying to get to see a good chiropractor my friend dealt with but don't know when that will be meanwhile the bills continue to pile up and I don't feel up to doing even the light duties being offered so I wait maybe not until my doctors come back but who knows how long it may be to get in with him as I am sure there will be lots of other patients backed up all I could do was call the office and leave a message as no receptionist or nurse are working it seems either while the doctors are away just a message saying go to a walk in clinic or emergency. So the frustration continues to build!!!  Kawartha Kev
