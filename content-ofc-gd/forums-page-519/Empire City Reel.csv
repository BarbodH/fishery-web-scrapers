It was in a hidden compartment in the bottom of the box.The box belonged to his father, my grandfather. Its a nickel plated reel with an ivory handle. It has Empire City on one side, and the number 40, stamped in the reel mount. Any idea of age, or country of origin?"

598452,mercman,2011-07-01 02:26:00,7054,"The brand name is stamped on the end of the real, the 40 is stamped under the reel seat"
