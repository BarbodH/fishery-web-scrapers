598083,davey buoy,2011-06-29 22:04:00,5505,"Hello everyone,fairly new here. I've noticed a few members from the barrie area. Anyone fished the notty in Angus lately? I know it's too early for the fall activity but just interested if it's worth venturing out over the long weekend. Thanks davey."
598087,misfish,2011-06-29 22:23:00,29133,"The river never did get back to normal all year,water level that is. Even today it higher and muddier then norm. Let hope it stays this way for the fall run."
598094,Fisherman,2011-06-29 22:33:00,7201,"Just a couple of errant cowpatties meandering along, in 27 years I've never seen the river stay this high for this time of the year."
598190,flash67,2011-06-30 02:21:00,28,Funny that you say that because the Nottawasaga river down by Hockley Valley at 5th Line and Hockley road (near Orangeville) has been its lowest in a while. Almost too shallow for fish to swim up the river now... Especially in some areas...
598202,Fisherman,2011-06-30 02:47:00,7201,Well then Brian must have his finger in the dike somewhere downstream of there.
598420,BillM,2011-07-01 01:10:00,17367,"Way to warm to be fishing for trout in the Notty, they'll be floating belly up in no time.  Unless you are fishing for carp or suckers, go somewhere else."
