Oh, Oh, the chase was on. It's amazing how fast a person following their dog can cover 100 acres. Hahaha! Suspect it was a deer or a turkey they were tracking. For those that don't know, a cottontail rabbit will run in a, relatively, small circle. Deer will run a long ways. Hahaha.  Thanks to Tri-Tronics, she came running up the trail looking for me. Good thing, I was about whipped!  Hope you all had a good day on the water."
