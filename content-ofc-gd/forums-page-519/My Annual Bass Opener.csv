598685,Bernie,2011-07-02 11:34:00,3190,That looks like it was a ton of fun!
596838,mercman,2011-06-26 13:34:00,7054,"My Brother and i have been doing this for a few years in memory of our Dad.This time i took my wife and my brother took a work buddy. My father only had the chance to fish White Lake, near Arnprior, once in his life, and that was the year before he passed, 18 years ago.   My brothers friend Steve,who is a fly fisherman, and on his first Bass opener,and my brother in his Ranger Comanche 40th anniversary eddition bassBoat.  All of us Limited within the first 5 hours, and enjoyed C&R for the balance of the day.       The wife and I put over 30 in the boat during our 7 hours on the water, My Bro and his buddy put at least that many in. There was the Annual White Lake Opener Tourny going on that day, but my brother has been fishing the lake at least once a week for the last 18 years and knows the lake inside out. It was funny seeing all thes boats scurrying all over the place looking for fish, and we are drifting over his hidden deep weedbeds, popping them in the boat, one after another  I brought my radios so we could communicate ""Fish On"" without allerting the crowd. This was by far, the best Opener i have experienced on the lake.Last year i was in my litte tinnie and could not reach the far end of the lake.This year, it wasnt a problem, with the New boat. D.R White was back on the Lake And he fished with his 2 sons once again !!!  Tite lines Dad !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   Paul"
596839,danc,2011-06-26 13:43:00,4677,Wow Paul. Doesn't get much better than that. Congrats..
596843,Joeytier,2011-06-26 13:55:00,3990,Nice!  How do largies compare to smallies eating wise?  I really enjoy smallmouth but havent tried largemouth yet.
596845,mercman,2011-06-26 14:00:00,7054," LOL !! i am just the opposite.Never tried smallie.I do know that lb per lb, smallie gives you the best action on the end of your rod. Hopefully i will be able to compare the 2 this summer.LMB is almost a sweet tasting fish, and the 2 - 2 1/2 lbers are the best tasting."
596848,Mike the Pike,2011-06-26 14:09:00,3421,"Great report Paul,you sure know how to catch Bass.  The boat is looking spiffy like a pro like; the way you have it all dressed up with the toys and decals.  Looking forward to fishing with you soon..   MTP"
596850,Rod Caster,2011-06-26 14:20:00,5784,"Success! And I thought, by your last posts, that you'd have trouble finding the fish... Boy was I wrong! That's one heck of an opener."
596853,mercman,2011-06-26 14:38:00,7054,"  Thanks Mike ! Dad taught us boys to fish the fish he loved, LMB. The other species, i am learning as i go. My Bro has decied that LMB is what he wants to fish, hence, the Bass Boat. I want to be Multi Species, hence, my choice of boat type. I would love to get out with you soon also Bud.   Paul"
596854,mercman,2011-06-26 14:42:00,7054,"  I hear ya Dude !! After reading my last post, i too thought i couldnt find the fish either Now i know for sure, i am a Bass Fisherman, learning to fish new species."
596862,Joey,2011-06-26 15:15:00,9122,"That's great Paul, heck of a great day of fishing for sure  Looks like a great place!!!"
596863,splashhopper,2011-06-26 15:36:00,2931,wtg paul.....

596883,camillj,2011-06-26 18:13:00,1988,"Great job Paul, and fabulous tribute to your dad ! (and a few inches for team 1)"
596905,Terry,2011-06-26 19:37:00,14456,looks like you guys did well  got to love bass'n
596911,misfish,2011-06-26 20:10:00,29133,"Nice fishing Paul. I,ll stick with a can of tuna."

596976,mercman,2011-06-27 00:09:00,7054,"Thanks guys The bait of choice in this lake, and we have been using the same thing for years, is Berkley Power Bait, 7 in Power worms, texas rigged with a 3/0 Trokar hook, in Tequila Sunrise color.Fished really slow in weed beds 10-12 feet deep.They suck it back like candy. I am definately going to try and get back there at least 2 more times this summer.  Tite lines everyone  Paul"
597227,mercman,2011-06-27 16:18:00,7054,  Ya !! We should be doing really well once the stats are updated Camil.I am sure i will be increasing the inches on Bass before the season ends.
598057,skeeter,2011-06-29 21:05:00,1907,"Great report!  I didnt get out for opener but I was out Monday with Kelly. My favorite bait is a Kelly Bait worm.( that is the name brand) They have 3 hooks in them, nose-middle and right on the tip of the tail."
598063,NAW,2011-06-29 21:19:00,4022,"You guys should go in the tourny next year.  But the looks of it, you might have a chance at the pot.."
598105,mercman,2011-06-29 22:55:00,7054,"  Hummmm....what d""ya think Skeets. Think we could be the next KVD'S ???"
598111,GBW,2011-06-29 23:02:00,8460,I think NAW is talking about you Paul and your brother.  You and Skeet's = STD not KVD...
598134,skeeter,2011-06-30 00:09:00,1907,Did your results come back positive AGAIN Geoff ??
598139,mercman,2011-06-30 00:23:00,7054,"  Good one Skeets.  NAW, my brother would most definately be a good Tourny Angler, but he just fishes for the pleasure. He has fished this lake so much, he can tell you what your looking at on Sonar, just by seeing where your boat is on the water."
598162,GBW,2011-06-30 00:59:00,8460, Results?  I've never been tested (other then after that smart    pill they came out with)  Go for it!
