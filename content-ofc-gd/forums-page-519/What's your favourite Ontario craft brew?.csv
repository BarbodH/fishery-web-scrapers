A few of my personal favourites include Neustadt's Scottish Pale, Muskoka's Premium Lager, and Trafalgar's Irish ale.  I'm currently trying Lake of Bay's Pale Ale, and am fairly impressed.  What are some of your favourites?"
598656,SBCregal,2011-07-02 04:01:00,688,"ive found myself looking to pick up some muskoka dark each time im in the lcbo.  i also like the mill st coffee porter and the maple porter from nickelbrook, i keep meaning to try them in a marinade/sauce for some bbq but i cant seem to keep them around long enough for some reason."
598659,cwpowell,2011-07-02 04:18:00,265,None of those beers or brewers are craft breweries.
598660,muskymike,2011-07-02 04:19:00,772,Definitely try Beau's. Just east of Ottawa. Remarkably good for a local beer.
598664,nroadrunner,2011-07-02 04:54:00,113,I live in Baysville on the street behind the lake of Bays  brewery.  I am not a beer drinker but that is the first good thing I have seen said about the taste of their beer.    Ian
598671,Rod Caster,2011-07-02 07:41:00,5784,I actually reallly enjoyed the LOB's beer at first but have had a few skunky ones since. The muskoka lineup is good indeed... But... We don't hold a candle to Quebec beer options unfortunately.
598712,Joeytier,2011-07-02 14:16:00,3990,"I forgot about Muskoka Dark.  An excellent brew.  And yeah, Quebec definitely has the superior breweries.  I just finished up a few bottles of Rigor Mortis from Dieu du Ciel in Montreal over the last few days."
598739,fishing n autograph,2011-07-02 15:40:00,2540,"i definitely like anything from the lion/waterloo brewery...waterloo dark, lion light. i also like duke of wellington ale"
