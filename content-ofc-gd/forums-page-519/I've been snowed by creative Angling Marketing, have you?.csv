598275,SRT8 smoker craft,2011-06-30 14:11:00,1107, Yep I always put bleeding pike in the livewell for awhile to make sure they will make it even had a hammer handle with a big clot of blood stuck to it's belly get hammered by a bigger hammer handle when I released the smaller one. the thing was directly under my boat and I had just let go when it latched onto the smaller one scared the bejezuz out of me. it's very visable in clear water anyways
598286,Harrison,2011-06-30 15:01:00,2202, Sorry Bout that.... I put a new one up. I love getting glamour shots.

598344,Jds63,2011-06-30 19:03:00,1365,"Lures are designed to catch fisherman first .... I know , I have hundredes of dollars worth of lures and use only 20% of them"
598362,canadadude,2011-06-30 20:34:00,769,"Red hooks work on a trigger thought to fish, fish don't think, they hit bait on a trigger thought, fish are dumb they don't have the brain capacity to think,Red hooks work because they trigger a fish to hit , the fish only knows that the red hook is different and may be a predator or somthing.I beleive in using red hooks on cranks and stuff, it dosn't hurt and ussually will increase your catch, it gives that little bit of trigger, on whats catching."
598370,jedimaster,2011-06-30 21:40:00,3472,I started catching more fish after I started waxing the bottom of my boat with gulp infused boat wax.
598411,GBW,2011-07-01 00:51:00,8460,I wonder if they make a version I can use on my tinny
598412,BillM,2011-07-01 00:55:00,17367,"My dad bought the 'Flying Lure' pack, lol.  We still use them to fish docks, they work awesome!"
598561,MJL,2011-07-01 19:16:00,2427,I remember stocking up on glow in the dark spoons from BPS called Little Leos    Didn't realize they were missing the C till I got home   . I should've known something was up when they were only going for $1.50
598570,Garry2Rs,2011-07-01 19:53:00,1425,"At I-Cast a year or two ago there was a line of lures shown that had special UV paint.  The colours and paint jobs were quite ugly, to me, but the theory was that these paints appeared quite differently to the fishes eye, than to human eyes.  Since we know that successful lures are the ones that catch fishermen, these lures have never made a big splash.  It could be that we missed a big break through..."
598572,Roy,2011-07-01 20:38:00,13728,"And they won't make a big splash because most lure manufacturers now routinely coat their baits with UV paints.....Luhr Jensen, Storm, Blue Fox, you nam'em. And if that isn't enough, if your old baits don't have the UV paints, you can buy it in a can at most tackle shops to give your baits a shot. The premise is quite ridiculous really when you read about it and see the smoke and mirror job. But hey, the stuff can't be that bad...I hear that there are some champion tournament stars using the stuff."
598049,Terry,2011-06-29 20:24:00,14456,well they have done scientific tests that shows the light spectrum and depth of water and what is visible they also know what part of the light spectrum different fish see at what depth ...
598052,Grimace,2011-06-29 20:46:00,2020,"Yup. I have read plenty of articles on it, however I do not recall exactly where.  A couple of them were fishing magazines and actually one science magazine that jus happened to be doing an article on the subject.  I would have to do some googling to find en again."
598053,canada414,2011-06-29 20:47:00,40,I honestly believe red hooks work better especially for smallmouth. My proof is last year while camping the fishing was really poor so I fooled around with the small fish while snorkeling. I observed the smallmouth would actually bit onto the red hook instead of the worm. .
598055,Grimace,2011-06-29 20:52:00,2020,Ugh.  A typo or two.
598056,Grimace,2011-06-29 20:54:00,2020, Apparently red is visible down to 12 or 14 feet or something like that.  So the red would be effective in shallow water.
598062,skeeter,2011-06-29 21:18:00,1907,"The Banjo minnow, flying lure,lighted flashing lure, there all good to use. But has no one ever bought the Helicopter lures? No one ever mentions them. Am I the only one who has these?"
598066,Canuck2fan,2011-06-29 21:32:00,1444,I only use red hooks for steelhead fishing for the simple reason I like the brand and they are red and work quite well. I think the color is irrelevant though because anyone will tell you if a trout sees your hook in any bait they are smart enough not to bite LOL....
598069,bigugli,2011-06-29 21:37:00,6138,The biggest snow jobs are all those magazine subscriptions that guarantee to put you on bigger and better catches of fish

598090,Handlebarz,2011-06-29 22:27:00,3790,I still have some of the flying lures they did work well back then maybe its time to get them back out since there will not be many using them now.

598135,solopaddler,2011-06-30 00:10:00,8605,"    Yeah yeah I know. Light spectrums, scientific tests, articles...   Unless you're actually a fish who knows what they see. It's all just speculation."
598143,mercman,2011-06-30 00:30:00,7054,"Not really. By examining the eye structure of fish ie. rods and cones,shapes and sizes, they can compare them to other animals, including man, and know extremely accurately, how and what fish see."
598145,danc,2011-06-30 00:32:00,4677," Confidence in a lure, hook color, technique is huge. If someone believes that they know what a fish can see, and it works for them, who's to argue?"
598146,Grimace,2011-06-30 00:32:00,2020,  That is my understanding of it as well.
598149,spincast,2011-06-30 00:36:00,3279,"in answer to the original thread, no..... but damn,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, those little red price tags on the dispays at CTC are like a drug........ can't count the stuff I bought there that is still as dry as the day it left the store............."
598156,mercman,2011-06-30 00:49:00,7054,"  Also, fish are extremely sensitive to uv lite. The color red is only visible from 2-40 feet  in clear water.Red may be percieved as an injured fish at these shalow depths, but red in the ultraviolte spectrum, is not red at all, but more of a grey to black color. Because of this sensitivity to UV,fish are able to detect prey or bait,more than 40 feet away, by silhouettes and reflections. UV lite can travel up to 2500 feet under water, while visible lite is absorbed within 40 feet."

598227,Dozer,2011-06-30 06:45:00,896," Fair enough, but the fishes eyes is qute similar to ours, so its only far to speculate they see what we see.  I mean, its only a stupid fish, as long as its yippershhhnap locks onto ours hooks I dont think we care what it sees."
597981,Harrison,2011-06-29 15:44:00,2202,"Some of the best marketing campaigns are found in the Fishing/Outdoor world.  I've gone for a couple.  I admit, I bought a ""Frog"" rod once, because it said frog on it.  Also, I have the same topwater lures with different colour tops, but with the same colour underside."
597991,fishnsled,2011-06-29 16:05:00,3520," Same here but it's because they were on sale, didn't really care about the colours as they were all the same on the underside. I've never bought a Banjo minnow or the flying lure but have certainly bought into other pitches.  I was out fished by the flying lure one day though....  It's not so much about catching fish after all, it's about catching the fisherman, they are the ones with the cash."

598028,kuhaman,2011-06-29 18:33:00,503,I got the banjo minnows too. Never did try them. Also got my son the rocket fishn rod( i think thats what it was called) He never did use it.

598030,umKthxbye,2011-06-29 18:50:00,247,"I don't know, the red hooks seem to catch more for me. The fish always hits the red one and not the black one on my crank baits. Ive done the same test Dave Mercer did with red on the front then change it to the back. Red is also the first color to disappear the deeper you go, not sure if that is a reason though since I don't more then 10 feet deep on most cranks."
598032,Grimace,2011-06-29 19:02:00,2020,The red does not disappear it just ceases to be red.  It would look like a grey or black. It does not go invisible.

598040,mercman,2011-06-29 19:47:00,7054,i got sucked into the lures with lites in them

When that claim is made are you talking about the human eye or from a fishes perspective?  How does anyone really know what a fish sees?  I've always found those types of statements funny."
598046,mercman,2011-06-29 20:12:00,7054,Phil.....get rid of that pic. I cant look at it with out coffee all over myself  
598048,asdve23rveavwa,2011-06-29 20:23:00,2690," My main reason for using the red hooks was that the Eagle Claw lazer sharp trebles I purchased the first time happened to be red.  I found that my catch ratio went way up, compared to factory hooks on Cleos especially.  So I've just stuck with it.  Whether or not I'm hooking more fish...don't know. Yeah the ""fish sees"" statements are always good ones, but, I get the biggest kick out of the ""pretty"" topwater baits.  Like the fish are jumping in the air to check out your lures"
