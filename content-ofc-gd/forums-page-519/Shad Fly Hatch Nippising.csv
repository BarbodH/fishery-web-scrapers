Heading up to Callander tomorrow for a week and want to know how tough it will be. Need to get my stratagy planned Thanks Scooter"
598540,Roy,2011-07-01 17:26:00,13728,It was on 2 weeks ago during the Lakair get together. I don't know how long it lasts.

598576,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-07-01 20:53:00,0,"  i can't speak for pickerel, but i would agree in principal for bass. my best bass fishing of the year is done with small grubs during mayfly hatches."
