751860,Rod Caster,2012-12-14 21:09:00,5784,"Jeremy84 and I are meeting up for the first time tomorrow to fish a small lake for fake trout (splake) near north bay. If anyone else would like to join us, please send me a PM.  Plan is to meet at 10AM. Bring ice picks, floater suit etc just to be as safe as possible. Ice should be at 4"", but we will be playing it slow and safe."
751878,livinisfishin,2012-12-14 22:39:00,661,If i wasnt working tomorrow i would have made the drive up for sure!
751890,Rod Caster,2012-12-14 23:26:00,5784,Ahhh. We'll have to meet up on nip thise year then. Combined we can take 4 keepers! Haha
751898,Christopheraaron,2012-12-15 00:04:00,3525,I would as well but it's a bit of a drive from here... Sometime this winter for sure though
751900,livinisfishin,2012-12-15 00:15:00,661,If i could get one i would be doing better then last year!
751955,wormdunker,2012-12-15 05:14:00,1711,"Good luck Chad, hope u get some.  How's the ice forming?"
751963,Freshtrax,2012-12-15 05:48:00,2215,I'm jealous.  But you want to hit some of those lakes up hwy 63  we talked about last year at some point this winter?
751967,Rod Caster,2012-12-15 06:22:00,5784," We've had good ice forming weather this week. Small, sheltered lakes are becoming safe and nipissing has a skim of ice.   I wont be too far from that location  If your travelling this way, give me a heads up...."
752117,Rod Caster,2012-12-15 23:30:00,5784,"Jeremy84 and I met up for the first time and had a great day on a small lake. The ice wasn't as good as I had thought, so we could not reach my honey hole but that's ok. We had nice weather and managed to catch one splake. JoeyT showed up later with some friends and they also caught a single fish.  Nice meeting you Jeremy!        "
752119,misfish,2012-12-15 23:45:00,29133,Nice fish.  Now explain that contraption.
752121,Rod Caster,2012-12-15 23:50:00,5784," haha, those are the new tipup designs from Jigerr.com. I've been giving them a try and so far they work quite well...they caught me the only fish today  There is nothing fancy about them, they just have a very unique look. Nice and simple and very easy to store/carry around."
752143,Sinker,2012-12-16 01:35:00,8692,Hmmmm.......I've had tip ups like that since I was a boy. Are these the next new thing? Kinda like drop shotting........I was doing that 30 years ago!!  Nice trout!!  S.
752179,Acountdeleted,2012-12-16 07:23:00,2562,"Had a blast today. Was a pleasure to meet you Chad and Joey and the other guys. Good conversations had, lots of info was shared and I got to try out a few of my toys (love ice fishing with a flasher). And got to see some splake.  Can't wait to get back up to North Bay again."
752180,wormdunker,2012-12-16 08:03:00,1711,"Good to see the ice.  Bonus u got a couple of fish.  Your tip up ""contraption"" is unique.  I see there are different settings for the line placement.  Is that for smaller to heavier fish?"
752192,Rod Caster,2012-12-16 12:44:00,5784," In a sense, yes. It essentially increases or decreases the sensitivity of the tip....I moved it to the front-heavy position for the splake so I could see any small hits."
752224,Freshtrax,2012-12-16 15:12:00,2215,"Sweet fish,  im gettin the itch real bad."
752283,Muskieman,2012-12-16 16:56:00,2472,"I have a few Jigrrs too , can't wait to use them , by far the best design I've ever had ."
752284,limeyangler,2012-12-16 16:57:00,5204,Nice one Chad....glad you are also a Jigerr 'Prostaff' too.....lol.
752325,Rod Caster,2012-12-16 19:02:00,5784,Haha prostaff. So when can I quit my dayjob??
752331,Leecher,2012-12-16 19:24:00,7832, Uhhh... I'm hurt Chad   Your not even using your other fishing apparel    No wonder you only caught one with this thing Weird looking contraption if you ask me  Over here not even close to getting on the hard stuff yet   so good on you for getting out
752432,Rod Caster,2012-12-17 00:08:00,5784,"Don't worry Jacques, for my regular fishing, walleye and pike, I'll be using yours. You can't beat that design! Infact, got a couple walleye tonight with them."
752732,Leecher,2012-12-18 00:02:00,7832, Right on Chad
