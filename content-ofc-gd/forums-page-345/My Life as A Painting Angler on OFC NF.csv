752528,bushart,2012-12-17 12:56:00,2628,Thanks Joey----For some reasons--that Angel is a fav of many around the globe---I had posted it a while back on a German website---it seemed to garner the most attention  Thanks Skip-----just glad we did'nt open the great cottage dock pitchin debates again  Thanks IFH----yes I do wander down nostalgia lane from time to time

752364,bushart,2012-12-16 21:13:00,2628,I was born at a very early age...I believe with a fishin rod in hand   
752366,bushart,2012-12-16 21:14:00,2628,As a youngster my ole Uncle used to take me fishin  
752368,bushart,2012-12-16 21:15:00,2628,Then I had kids and had to teach them how to fish  
752369,bushart,2012-12-16 21:16:00,2628,Now other Members may think---that painter is quite a space cadet  
752370,bushart,2012-12-16 21:18:00,2628,I kinda used to like to smoke-----gave it up years ago---maybe in the next life we can again  
752371,bushart,2012-12-16 21:20:00,2628,Now of course I ain't goin till I absolutely have to

752415,bushart,2012-12-16 23:46:00,2628,Thanks Blaque---yes I've been guilty of pitchin docks in my life  Re: Painting-----It's easy----just mix one cup of lifetime experiences with 2 tbsps of confidence---2 parts cold beer  Mix well----heat to 98.6 degrees and your done.  Seriously...like anything...practice/practice/practice...and let yourself fail--and learn from it....dreams help
