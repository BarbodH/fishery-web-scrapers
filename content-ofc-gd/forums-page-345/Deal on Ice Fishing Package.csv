751960,wormdunker,2012-12-15 05:36:00,1711,I've never seen or heard of speckled trout in Simcoe.  Must be another Lake Simcoe??
751979,Rich,2012-12-15 11:19:00,3927,If theres specks in any creek leading into simcoe .. then they came from the lake..
751995,Rod Caster,2012-12-15 14:20:00,5784, lots of specks stay in creeks all winter. I know many speck creeks that are nowhere near a lake.
751999,Christopheraaron,2012-12-15 14:32:00,3525, The notty would be one example...
