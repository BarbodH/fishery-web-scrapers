740300,Christopheraaron,2012-10-28 21:16:00,3525," Looking at the same rod right now, how much was shipping?"
742000,phatpelkey,2012-11-04 11:33:00,78,"spent a few hours casting yesterday, still havent got my first musky, but its not from the lack or trying i will tell you that much, may go out again today, but still undecided"
742018,Handlebarz,2012-11-04 13:36:00,3790,Nice to see you yesterday Adam sorry we could not stop over we had to get going. Keep at it when I first started targeting musky it took a lot of hours out to get into my first. Good luck
742714,phatpelkey,2012-11-08 21:22:00,78,"spent another couple hours last night casting, still no musky, so i will keep trucking along, i will eventually get my musky!!!"
742716,lew,2012-11-08 21:33:00,12766," Just keep plugging away, that 1st one is always the toughest to get.  They come much easier once the 1st one is outta the way."
742717,Rich Nelson,2012-11-08 21:35:00,332," First one was definately the hardest for me. Just curious where you have been trying? From boat or shore?  Certain waterbodies have much higher densities than others. Good luck,  it will happen ."
742729,Rich,2012-11-08 22:44:00,3927,"I have a huge ugly stik musky rod with a BPS musky angler reel, spooled with 80lb braid. The whole thing was under $200 and ive never felt the need to upgrade, as i rarely fish musky."
742752,phatpelkey,2012-11-09 00:08:00,78,"i fish from shore, in spots i know there is musky, just hasnt been my time yet, gotta work all weekend so it will have to wait until next week for my next shot at it   "
742753,phatpelkey,2012-11-09 00:09:00,78," iv decided on a rod i want, its a 7'6' shimano compre 1 peice, as for reel havent decided yet, but still have to save enough money to buy the rod and reel"
742758,Rich Nelson,2012-11-09 00:18:00,332,"Abu has a great selection of quality Musky reels with a variety of models and prices. Just realized where Grande Point was. You shouldnt have too much trouble hookin up from ""there""."
742761,phatpelkey,2012-11-09 00:22:00,78, they reel on the rod im borrowing rigth now has and abu (record i believe) on it as i like it other then its the wrong hand lol
742916,phatpelkey,2012-11-09 19:45:00,78,"well spent another 2 hours casting today, still nothing, oh well will wait til next week for my next chance"
743009,Dontcryformejanhrdina,2012-11-10 04:31:00,535,"I started targetting musky last year during bass opener/late June....I never caught my first until September. It was well worth the wait though. One big mistake I made was I fished low density waters while looking for my 1st. Fish high numbers waters if you can.  Fishing from shore is going to be tough, since you usually have to cover a lot of water while looking for active fish. It's certainly not impossible though."
743071,F_ast,2012-11-10 17:43:00,154,"Trebleys Tacklebox in Orillia has a great rob in their clearance area.  Fenwich HMG AV.  When I bought mine several years ago when they first came out, the rod was about $250.  Think they are selling them for $80 or something.  As for the first fish, they can be tough.... especially from shore... and especially in the late fall.  Keep at it, but I think the your chances will be better in the spring or floating a large live bait rig now."

743215,lew,2012-11-11 20:34:00,12766,"Congrats on finally getting your 1st musky, you've worked hard for her and you deserve it. You got her in a very productive spot that holds alot of fish and you'll get many more from that same place."

752130,phatpelkey,2012-12-16 00:37:00,78,"with the season closed, here is a couple more pics to add to this thread, got 3 more fish, 1 of them for each of the 3 times i went fishing, nothing huge but hey there fish lol     all in all a good first year fishing for musky for me, i learned alot!!!, i was just getting the hang of it, oh well bring on the ice fishing now lol"
752145,Rich Nelson,2012-12-16 01:47:00,332,"Good job.... Getting three from shore in three trips is almost impossible to do on most waterbodies. Congrats, now you are hooked for life. Lol Standing shoulder to shoulder with guys chuckin 14 inch bulldawgs is probably a little scary..."
752164,Handlebarz,2012-12-16 04:07:00,3790,Nice going Adam. I hope we can meet up for some eyes this winter it's been way to long since we got out there.  Next year we will get out for sure since your hooked and will be ready from opener.
738585,phatpelkey,2012-10-21 22:45:00,78,"ok im new to musky and i dont know what rod and reel i should get for a starter set up, i will be chucking bulldawgs from shore, could you guys please suggest a cheap but yet reliable set up for a beginner  thank you in advance  if someone would have a used set-up forsale please let me know"
738587,mercman,2012-10-21 22:52:00,7054,"7.5 ft Compre HF and a Shimano Corvalus reel.Just under 200, and a really nice combo to get you started."
738604,Handlebarz,2012-10-22 00:09:00,3790,HA HA first it was ice fishing now musky your as big of a sucker as the rest of us Adam.  If anyone has a good rod/reel combo they want to part with please help Adam out we want to make sure he is hooked hard into musky.  Adam is a good guy with a huge heart (sorry did not mean to be sappy but he is a good guy) so lets help him out I can assure you he will put the combo to good use.
738956,mike rousseau,2012-10-23 07:28:00,4661,  Hey Paul.... Just curious why you'd recommend a rod that fell apart the first day you used it...?
738967,outllaw,2012-10-23 10:53:00,1232,phatkelly. i see you grew tired of catching baitfish. welcome to the darkside lol.
738968,mercman,2012-10-23 11:06:00,7054," When i took it in to have it repaired, the guy showed me the tip.I must slammed the tailgate on it at one time.My box is 6ft. 7 on the diagonal.Rod is 7.5feet.Makes sense?  The original guides on my rod, are NLA, so he upgraded it for me."
738974,Rich Nelson,2012-10-23 11:55:00,332,"Corvalus Havent had very good luck with the Compre myself, and a friend went through three in one season ( broke them with normal use) Also, the Corvalus is the bottom end of round reels, and wont last long throwing the big baits. Plastic guts, and IMO garbage. If you spend a bit more now, it will last uou a lot longer."
738989,Live2fish85,2012-10-23 13:02:00,1633,I love the combo I picked up this year. I have the 8' St. Croix Premier and a Revo Toro Winch awesome combo. My next one is going to be another Premier and a Curado 301e

739016,cram,2012-10-23 14:57:00,1733,"8 foot Okuma EVX Heavy is a solid all around rod, for $100 or less. Tackle Industries also apparently makes great rods that are relatively low cost, but i have never tried one."
739027,mercman,2012-10-23 16:15:00,7054," Agreed, the Corvalus is ""ENTRY"" level to Musky fishing.Thats what the OP is looking for.If he is anything like me, he will be fishing Musky maybe 5-6 times a season. Perfectly fine for that. Mine is the 400 series, diecast aluminum frame,metal gears,aluminum endcaps etc.Its a pretty tough reel for the bucks.  When i took up Musky fishing, i asked for advise on the board too, and Compre was the most refered rod by many of the Musky guys here.I own 4 compre rods, and other than a broken tip top guide(which as it turns out, was my fault) they are great.Are there better? Absolutely, but for a novice, they are bullet proof. Personally, i dont believe in buying top of the line, when just starting out for Musky.Its not for everyone, and if you do get ""Hooked"", you can pass the combo onto the next person, and go all out on high end gear.  I have my sights set on a Calcutta and St Croix as my next combo.Just waiting for the wife to drop her guard, and leave the credit card unattended:whistling:    Cheers    Paul"
739029,jeffw,2012-10-23 16:25:00,267,Lebarons has the new daiwa DMV musky rods for under $100 and there is a 8.6' model that would be perfect for bulldawgs.
739074,phatpelkey,2012-10-23 19:54:00,78,"well thanks to a good neighbour of mine he is letting me use his back up rod and reel for now till i can find a good used one or a good deal on a new one!! being so close to xmas i cant afford a whole lot right now, espically when i only plan on using it maybe 5-6 times a year, i did get offered a sweet deal on a st croix, but just cant afford that much for just a rod rigth now, has anybody ever tried a okuma akena? any feedback on that reel?"
739076,Handlebarz,2012-10-23 20:22:00,3790,LOL tell Terry to give you his best combo he has not been using it. Also tell him to park that big black Pete and start fishing again the musky have missed him
739078,mercman,2012-10-23 20:25:00,7054,"Looks pretty similar to my Shimano Corvalus.Same costruction, same size.I would venture to say that it would be perfect for your needs.Like the Corvalus, its a good entry level reel, but i am sure the true Musky guys will say its crap"
739079,BucktownAngler,2012-10-23 20:39:00,582,http://www.lebaron.ca/pdf_files_sp13/penn_reels.pdf  heres a cheap $100 Penn combo at the bottom of the page. Might be good bang for your buck

739441,FinS,2012-10-25 06:06:00,463,i bought the whuppin stik 8ft heavy from cabelas.ca 29.99 awesome rod for the money 10 yr warranty fast shipping 4 days and i got it casts bulldawgs and bondys with ease i had it paired with a cardiff 400 i bought it cause i figured it was a good deal would make an awesome trolling rod too
739577,Rich Nelson,2012-10-25 17:54:00,332,10 year warranty for a $30 rod? I gotta look into this... Ha ha
739602,DaveMc,2012-10-25 20:07:00,89, keep Terry's setup until the end of the season and i will see what deals i can get you in november
