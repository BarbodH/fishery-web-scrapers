752580,cityfisher,2012-12-17 16:38:00,959,"Hey all,  My brother just let me know that over the past couple weeks, he burnt all the firewood i split during the summer!!  Can anyone recommend someone local near minden then would deliver a facecord/bushcord?  Thanks!"
752582,BillM,2012-12-17 16:40:00,17367,Tell him to start chopping!  LOL!
752616,woodenboater,2012-12-17 19:30:00,2277,"Seriously, I'd give him the deets and let him pay for it. No reason why all your hard work should be for his benefit. At least not the entire stack of wood  or get someone to deliver wood that needs to be split and let him have at it lol."
752617,Roy,2012-12-17 19:34:00,13728,"Some folks will be embarrassed if by chance the poor man is physically challenged. Hey, you never know...maybe Cityfisher just likes helping his brother!"
752618,BillM,2012-12-17 19:36:00,17367," If he can haul wood in, he can easily rent a splitter and go to town if need be"
752619,Roy,2012-12-17 19:38:00,13728," OOPS, sorry Bill. I forgot...compassion doesn't work here."
752622,BillM,2012-12-17 19:51:00,17367, I was just being a sarcastic ass
752678,chris.brock,2012-12-17 22:22:00,4053,"I don't know what side of Minden you are on, but, on Deep Bay Rd, south of Minden, just south of Bob Lk Rd, there's a guy on the west side selling and I've heard people like him. It's a good idea to not to accept his first offer on a price.  Tons of guys selling up there, just not many websites to find them."
752685,irishfield,2012-12-17 22:31:00,26272,Split this summer and burned already... I'd be calling a chimney sweep as well! Unseasoned wood is just a recipe for disaster.
752693,cityfisher,2012-12-17 22:47:00,959, It was sitting in chunks for 2 years already.. so we split and burned it soon after.. nice and dry   Im sure he will help out with the $$ or get the next one
752809,chimpboy_to,2012-12-18 02:10:00,27, There is also a guy on 121 near the the  Ingolsby road cutoff selling wood. I have family up there PM me if you need some phone numbers.  Andrew
752869,singingdog,2012-12-18 11:48:00,1047,Try Clare Ridsdale: 705.488.1075. Sorry for the lack of judgemental or smart ass comments.
752885,cityfisher,2012-12-18 13:18:00,959,All good thanks guys
752889,GBW,2012-12-18 13:42:00,8460,If you still need a place PM me.  My father might be able to help and he's near 4 mile lake on the other side of Coby.
