751800,G.mech,2012-12-14 16:47:00,830,That is the biggest of the Buddy heaters and that's a great price on them.  I use one in my 4 man portable on the very coldest and windiest days and it does a great job.  It also has a built in quick connect so you can run a 5lb or 20 lb cylinder.  It is a little bulky though so I normally use the smaller Portable buddy unless it's really cold.  I think this heater would be too large for a smaller hut especially if you're trying to travel light.

Everyone else the regular price is around $179.00. I thought that the TSC model might contain the adapter hose or something extra but no. It seems to be the same as everyone else. And they don't carry the adapter hose. But they can special-order it. Still,at $149.00 a good deal."
