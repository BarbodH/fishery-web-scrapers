752409,blaque,2012-12-16 23:29:00,2419,How u guys liking this competitive NFL Barnburner. 47-17.....what a game
752410,jedimaster,2012-12-16 23:30:00,3472,Was almost 54-17 if not for the flags. Buffalo can have the bills back we have enough loser teams up here.
752412,davey buoy,2012-12-16 23:33:00,5505," Buffalo needs help,maybe they should stay here!lol. If given the chance,hate to see what the Argos would do to them:P."
752413,kickingfrog,2012-12-16 23:37:00,8333,They may have trouble crossing the border next time.
752416,blaque,2012-12-16 23:46:00,2419,"50, heck they may have trouble gettin back in the country THIS time"
752424,Rich Clemens,2012-12-16 23:56:00,3131,No problem her.   Helping out my dolphins a bit
752429,kickingfrog,2012-12-16 23:59:00,8333,No they're not. The dolphins will be drafting behind the bills and neither are making the play-offs.
752439,lookinforwalleye,2012-12-17 00:22:00,4399,Ya some great NFL action there    lots  of nfl fans disguised as empty seats!  When does spring training start
752446,Rich Clemens,2012-12-17 00:30:00,3131, Hey ....   We still have a chance.
752466,jedimaster,2012-12-17 01:37:00,3472,  X2 great game by the fins today... albeit against a crap team.
752479,blaque,2012-12-17 02:14:00,2419,Niners/pats is a slippery one so far
752491,kickingfrog,2012-12-17 03:32:00,8333,"Ya, San Fran could have stayed home and got rained on. Should be snow in NE in the middle of December."
752493,Toad Hunter,2012-12-17 03:43:00,261, The dolphins have a ton of draft picks next year and are only a few tweaks away (and an aging Tom Barbie) away from being continuous P/O threats. A nice WR to take some attention of Hartline and Bess (who have proven their talents when not under double coverage) - and the def. secon_dreary needs improved too thats for sure. And I for one and happy about all these points. GO FINS !
752499,blaque,2012-12-17 04:14:00,2419," Yepper, my neighbor cut his freakin grass today lol"
