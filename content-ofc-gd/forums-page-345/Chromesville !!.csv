753064,woodro,2012-12-18 23:33:00,168," Never heard of gulp minnows under a float, how would you rig it?"
753067,MJL,2012-12-18 23:47:00,2427,"Very sweet Chris    Down in the Niagara, I rig them on 1/16oz - 1/8oz jig heads. For smaller rivers, I sometimes just thread them through the nose with the same #8-10 hook I use for other baits like roe and pink worms."
753069,misfish,2012-12-18 23:49:00,29133, Im going to find out how well they work. Just got some yesterday.
753103,BillM,2012-12-19 02:08:00,17367, I like them a lot more in the spring then I do the fall (Unless we are talking early fall)
750452,ChrisK,2012-12-09 18:32:00,2772,With the rains most of the week and the water up fresh runs of steel made there way into our Huron tribs and this only meant one thing for us weekend warriors.....FISH ON! It was a great weekend with many beached fish and a few lost along the way. Fish were all good size with most in the five to eight and a couple in ten pound range. These fish were fresh from the lake and hard fighting machines. I had to cut it short today but still managed a few nice fish by lunch time. Moms birthdays are about the only thing that takes precedence over steelheading this time of year so Happy Birthday Mom           Cheers !
750463,Christopheraaron,2012-12-09 18:57:00,3525,Nice! I still can't believe i'm still looking for the first of the fall.
750467,misfish,2012-12-09 19:02:00,29133,"Real nice fish Chris.  Was out yesterday,water was high and getting dirty by the hour with the rain. Hit some sweet spots that produce most of the time.Maybe a fresh run is on it,s way.  I need to rethink my attack mode. Need to start switching up from roe and beads,and think outside the box I think.  Again,real nice chromers."
750469,tb4me,2012-12-09 19:08:00,3295,Nice fish! Way to go and thanks for sharing your day! Oh and Happy bday to ma too

Started out looking very bleak with the river at its ultimate lowest like I've never seen and then thank god it started to rain and they are still predicting more rain this week before the snow comes on the weekend. I love fishing when its snowing  Cheers !!
