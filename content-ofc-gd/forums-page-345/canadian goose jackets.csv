749872,GregF2,2012-12-07 12:52:00,46,"I have the Canada Goose Artic Rigger Snowmobile Suit (wife got it for me for Christmas a couple years ago) and it is fantastic.  Use it mainly for ice fishing, which works great, since we do not use a ice hut.  I can not imagine ever getting cold in that suit.  I also have a Arcteryx Fission SV, which is also very warm, but only use it when it is warmer out for ice fishing.  Mostly use that one for skiing."

749566,mistaredone,2012-12-06 03:25:00,913,Arc'teryx jackets are top quality jackets but you pay for the quality. Id guess the Canada Goose are in the higher end on price to but I've never checked.
749589,adempsey,2012-12-06 05:24:00,1498,"Are you buying it because she asked for a warm coat, or specifically a Canada Goose coat?  The Canada Goose coats have been very fashion trendy for the past couple of years, so if it's for fashion reasons make sure you buy the actual brand =)  I see all these kids wearing them in downtown Toronto and I just think how hot they must be, lol.  I'd sweat my Ferrero Roches off just walking down the street in one."

Maybe take a look at this Canadian company's parkas. A friend has one of their down parkas and stayed toasty warm in it. People might be put off or turned on by their cool/hip meter (their photo gallery is quite nice but maybe not for kid's eyes) but they're not as ubiquitous if that matters.  http://store.mooseknucklescanada.com/  My hands down fav down parka was an early Eddie Bauer but I'm now wearing a North Face parka."

749660,ADB,2012-12-06 15:39:00,444,"Good luck finding a sale on them...they don't allow their retailers to sell them at a discount.  That is why all stores. whether it is Le Baron or Harry Rosen sell them for more or less the same price.  I've heard some stories about Costco and Bass Pro carrying them at one point, but after discounting them, Canada Goose no longer allowed them to place orders for upcoming seasons.  Best bet it to buy at Le Baron...buy their membership for $25 and save 10%.  So you'll net save $25 on a $500 coat, plus you'll have their membership for a year."

No legit retailer be it brick and mortar/online is allowed to discount CG as it is not allowed by them. As was mentioned in earlier post, LeBaron is the best bet with your card. The Richmond Hill location moves a ton of them."

749531,mr blizzard,2012-12-06 00:12:00,1589,fish-meister  The Canada Goose are nice coats. My wife bought one used last year and really likes it but as Drifter mentioned the Choko Adventurer is an amazing coat. My first one is at least 10 years old and that was my ice hut on Simcoe and in Parry Sound for years. I bought a second one when we got here.  When it gets cold enough in the -25 and down she will put on one of the Chokos instead when we are out on the ice.  If you want to get her one with the hood the Canada Goose are still a great coat for every day use.
