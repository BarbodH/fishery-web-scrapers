The data collected is then used to help monitor the health of those fisheries.   A quick wrap up of the diary program.  At the end of the diary season diaries are submitted and  prizes are given out.  The random draw winner, for a $100 CT gift card, was Harvey Beard of Welland.  Most creative diary, for a $50 CT gift card, was Martin Kerr of Hamilton.  Most diary entries, for a $50 CT card, was Bruce Downs of Grimsby.   At the end of November an number of repeat participants in the diary program were also invited to a volunteer appreciation night to receive a small gift for their participation"
