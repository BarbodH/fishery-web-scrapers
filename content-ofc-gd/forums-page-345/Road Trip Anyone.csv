752354,sleepjigging,2012-12-16 20:41:00,207,I am hoping someone can lead an expedition to a back lake up North where we can do some ice fishing. Share gas/expenses.  Anyone else chomping at the bits?  Sleepjigging

752494,sleepjigging,2012-12-17 03:44:00,207," I started this thread when I read about the conditions in Timmins. But it's a little far.  North Bay sounds better.  I am in Toronto, and it's like +7C degrees for the week. I haven't even put on the winter tires yet. It feels warmer than last year."
