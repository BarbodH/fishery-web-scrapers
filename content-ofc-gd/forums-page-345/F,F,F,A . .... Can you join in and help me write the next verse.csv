752263,Christopheraaron,2012-12-16 16:24:00,3525," Nice! But can that 4 inch auger cut though 18"" of ice?"
752276,Nipfisher,2012-12-16 16:48:00,2449," Yep, 4"" is the radius of the blades, not the length of the auger. The smaller the blades (providing they are sharp) the easier it is to cut. I was given a 10"" manual auger by a friend. Cut 2 holes and you are finished."
