At this point, we are unsure if the meat has been tampered with or poisoned, the treated dogs are doing well. Please take care in this area!"

753024,Twocoda,2012-12-18 21:48:00,4130," Yes they are targeting dogs,,,a few weeks ago in Oshawa there were several dogs poisoned in an off leash dog park....Take extra care to what your dog gets into,,,"
753034,woodenboater,2012-12-18 22:05:00,2277,"Sounds like what happened in Withrow Park in Toronto a few years ago.  A local who didn't like dogs in the park did similar. Think it was meat as well, not sure. A few dogs died I think, one was a King Charles that belonged to a high profile banker."

753134,GBW,2012-12-19 04:30:00,8460,was he un-noticed or feeding them in plane view of all to see?
753139,bigugli,2012-12-19 05:21:00,6138,Sadly. it happens all the time. I've known numerous incidents where dogs have been poisoned with antifreeze or warfin. I've even found the baited meat and dishes of antifreeze left out in the park. Enforcement came up empty handed.
