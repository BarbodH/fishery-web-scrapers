751683,Burtess,2012-12-14 00:14:00,901,"I know these are two totally different machines, and the Elite 4X is more advanced, but considering the prices, which one would you purchase?  I icefish casually, local lakes mostly for panfish and pike.  I gathered the following info on the units:   There are other features but those were the ones I found in common.  So do I need the Elite 4X or will the PiranhaMax 160 do me ok??  Thanks, Burt"
751686,DRIFTER_016,2012-12-14 00:26:00,10439,I'm sure the cheapy will do you fine.
751738,Woodsman,2012-12-14 05:57:00,1286,"Ice transducer available for the 160. The 170 is far better @ 1600 watts, 8 levels of grayscale & twice the pixels. Never seen it offered in a portable package though. All that being said the Elite 4x is a better unit by far. Also consider the Humminbird Ice 345c. Same specs as the Elite except slightly more power at 2400 watts. $315"
751845,EC1,2012-12-14 20:13:00,930,"Colour is much better, especially for ice fishing. The main point is, you CAN cheap out on the fishfinder, only to upgrade again in a year or two.... OR you can buy one that's good enough to last you until it falls apart."
751996,woodro,2012-12-15 14:27:00,168,"I've been looking for a flasher/fish finder for ice fishing as well. The Elite 4x looks very similar to the x67, anyone know the differences between the two?"
752000,Marko,2012-12-15 14:38:00,854,"If you have the money go with the better one. There is a reason why one is twice the price of the other one, most of the time you get what you pay for."
752106,Woodsman,2012-12-15 22:40:00,1286,"IIRC the Elite 4x has about 30% more power, dual beam transducer & a few different screen options. Also the Elite is a new unit where the X67 is no longer made. The Elite has moved much closer to the Humminbird 345c in specs but still not quite there."
753012,Burtess,2012-12-18 21:22:00,901,Well I picked up the 160 Portable priced matched at the local CT for $119 + tax ($134.47).  Too cheap to pass up!  I figure if I try it out and I am happy with it then great...... if I don't like the performance I can put the 160 on kijiji and keep the case/battery/charger and mount a different unit in it.  Buying the portable case with battery for the Humminbird or Lowrance finders is $145 anyway so I either way I am ahead.  Now I have to let the wife wrap it lol....  Burt
