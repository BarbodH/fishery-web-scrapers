753005,Bassassins,2012-12-18 21:12:00,111,Well it is that time of year! Time to break the ice... with Smooths new gear all sitting under the tree we decided to still give it a go and share Rob's equipment to get out for our first ice of the year. After a little warmer weather we double checked with the bait shop guys to make sure we were safe to go and although it was a wet one it was a ton of fun. First fish came quite quickly and they didn't seem to stop for the couple of hours we were out... Smooth taking the early lead with a consistent bite but Rob hammered a late rush fish after fish at the end to pull 1 fish ahead and win the day.      Nothing huge here at all but it was great to get out and shake all that ice rust off. Will be busy with the Christmas break but can't wait to get back out there again soon.  Happy Holidays to ALL! We hope you have lots of fishing toys under the tree and tight lines on the ice  Rob and Rob www.thebassassins.com
