751591,funfishing,2012-12-13 16:50:00,147,"Usually only takes 1 hour. Not a boring drive at all. Oshawa to Ottawa via 401/416 can be boring. I used to get very bored in the stretch from Kingston to Ottawa. However, having driven this route several times in the past few months, I've gotten used to it and actually prefer it now over taking highway 7.  Highway 7 route is 50km or so shorter, but much slower speed limit and lots of stops. Not to mention a tonne of cops waiting to pull you over. 120km or even more seems tolerated on the 401, whereas on an 80km/h road, they can easily nail you for 20km/h over. Worse yet is if you're going 90km/h and hit a 60km/h zone without noticing..happens all the time to people, especially at night.  I've never encountered traffic going from Oshawa to Belleville."
751613,Dontcryformejanhrdina,2012-12-13 18:17:00,535,"Yeah the drive from Oshawa to Belleville (and vice versa) is a breeze, I have family in Oshawa and actually enjoy the drive to Oshawa from Belleville. Once you get past Oshawa headed west it gets brutal, can't say I enjoy that very much lol."
751623,ecmilley,2012-12-13 19:44:00,2163,"by mid-feb the fish have moved into hay-bay on the south and upto belleville, trenton areas. also areas around napanee just watch the ice use the same stuff you have for nipissing you'll do fine. as for the drive no biggie have made oshawa to picton in a hour zero traffic"
751629,Muskieman,2012-12-13 20:40:00,2472,"Thanks guys , this trip sounds better an better ..."
751641,cityfisher,2012-12-13 21:28:00,959,drive is not bad.. .esp if going early Worst ice is ALWAYS on quinte(Compared to all the places i go over the last 10 years)... don't go solo or without a float suit !! Currents are everywhere!!  Popular spots... Big Island Desaronto Bellville Hay bay Picton
751695,Stoty,2012-12-14 00:50:00,2910,"Randy... I'm in Bowmanville and used to guide on Quinte... the drive is EASY. Road conditions are the thing you need to focus on, not the traffic. The most annoying part are those MORON truckers that take 10 mins to ""pass"" another truck (because it goes down to 2 lanes east of Cobourg)!!   As for where to go, that all changes from week to week or even day to day.  PM me a little bit before your trip and I'll try and give you some tips as to where the ""hot"" bite is."
751704,dhickey,2012-12-14 01:23:00,1038,And I thought this was all about a fishing party? The drive would be easy for you and the fishing good if you get good info. An ATV or sled would help.
751705,Stoty,2012-12-14 01:25:00,2910, Careful........ There's not many spots on the Bay that can handle a Sled/ATV on a regular basis!!
751707,Joeytier,2012-12-14 01:31:00,3990,How much jet fuel did you go through?
751708,Stoty,2012-12-14 01:33:00,2910,I was thinking the SAME thing... lol  Maybe set your cruise to 180 km/h and hope for the best! LOL
751733,Sinker,2012-12-14 04:11:00,8692,"EH! Look me up when your coming. I'm off mid week, fish quinte a lot, and would love to meet ya!  S."
751758,ecmilley,2012-12-14 12:46:00,2163,  about 1/2 a tank on a wing and a prayer and didn't see no radar and i w as in my sporty car my truck is governed to 160
751767,Moosebunk,2012-12-14 13:53:00,3970,"""Usually"" off midweek too Randy.  Lemme know dates closer to time and may be able to swing a day down that way."
752007,woodro,2012-12-15 14:49:00,168,"We have been doing an annual trip to Quinte for the past 4 years right around family day long weekend. As many have already said, ice can be really sketchy depending on the area you're fishing. We've had success, but not a lot of it,  fishing the telegraph narrows, and big bay. This year We are trying to hit first ice fishing hay bay area, which I've also heard was really good. Hopefully there's ice jan 18 weekend. I'll post results after the trip (all depends on ice conditions) it Might help your decision in Feb."
751444,Muskieman,2012-12-13 00:56:00,2472,"Eh!  I'm gonna attempt to plan a Quinte trip this upcoming February ,I'll have a few days off (mid week) during the second week... I'll be staying in Oshawa .. questions... What's the drive from Osahwa like in the AM? Where should I start from, where do I park? I walk out I guess? Do I look for people with floater suits and sleighs? Go punch a hole 50'away or so to be respectful?  Thanks Gang.  Randy "
751446,Christopheraaron,2012-12-13 01:03:00,3525,  That's the worst drive I've ever been on...  
751448,Joeytier,2012-12-13 01:14:00,3990,What's wrong with the drive from Belleville to Oshawa?  I've done it a million times and the only time the traffic is even remotely bad is long weekends...
751449,Muskieman,2012-12-13 01:15:00,2472,  so I shouldn't go ?  besides your drive how was the fishing ?
751450,crappieperchhunter,2012-12-13 01:17:00,2582, I live in Oshawa and seriously have no clue what your talking about??? Heading east of Oshawa in the morning is a piece of cake. Virtually no traffic at all. Now heading west towards Toronto...that's another story all together. Did it for 2 years and don't miss it one bit.
751451,Live2fish85,2012-12-13 01:17:00,1633,"  Yep. I haven't drove million times lol, but I have gone that way plenty of times with no real problem."
751452,misfish,2012-12-13 01:19:00,29133, From the mouth of babes.
751453,Christopheraaron,2012-12-13 01:23:00,3525,"Not too long, just boring, I'd try to stay closer to bellville."
751454,Muskieman,2012-12-13 01:26:00,2472,Ok...
751456,whiskywizard,2012-12-13 01:27:00,305,"The drive east out of Oshawa is light traffic, traveling fast. Your only worry is getting caught speeding.  1.5h will get you to the water in Belleville.  Did you have a specific area of Quinte you were thinking of, or do you need some suggestions?  Some areas have moving water and dicey ice conditions are common. How far do you want to travel?"
751458,Gerritt,2012-12-13 01:29:00,6129,"Randy, your looking at 1.5 hours and a bit or so to Belleville..... and the drive will be a piece of cake.  Napanee add another 30-45 minutes  Look me up and I will join you, I am on your way  G"
751464,Muskieman,2012-12-13 01:42:00,2472,"Never been there , looking for all the help I can get .  Gerritt, I just might take you up on that ."
751495,irishfield,2012-12-13 03:42:00,26272,You're gonna fish with Gerritt.. you'd better have a motel within walking distance.. just  sayin !!
751500,Gerritt,2012-12-13 03:54:00,6129,"  LOL! no need for a motel, we can make my house the FOB... 3 spare bedrooms and I can walk down the street to fish as a bonus!"
751501,irishfield,2012-12-13 03:59:00,26272,"LOL.. great stuff G.. sounds like a good G2G spot. The ""old"" neighbourhood"" might object though!"
751502,BillM,2012-12-13 04:00:00,17367," Wait, what?  Oshawa heading east in the morning?  During the week?  That's about the best drive you'll ever find, lol."
751503,Gerritt,2012-12-13 04:01:00,6129,No doubt.... we have to walk past Viagra-Ville to get fishing...  Ugh Brighton.....  G
751504,dhickey,2012-12-13 04:12:00,1038, Sounds like the party is at Jerrits house..
751506,Gerritt,2012-12-13 04:19:00,6129," LOL, I've already invited you too brother.. 2 minutes and were fishing."
751510,Fish Farmer,2012-12-13 04:56:00,2234,"You already know the secret Randy, I hope you hit the day their hitting, not like it says in my signature. Heavey jigging spoon and minnow, Mr Champ was a goto lure. And if you don't have any luck, your in good company Gerritt"
751538,wormdunker,2012-12-13 13:50:00,1711,"Hey Randy check out quinteicefishing.com  lottsa good info.  I've never fished quinte, but it's on my bucket list"
751541,Headhunter,2012-12-13 13:58:00,5703,"I've heard the drive from the GTA to Quinte described as being up hill both directions! Randy, some of us have been talking to Gerritt about an ice GTG based around his place in Brighton. Perhaps we could coordinate a GTG based around your availability... just make sure that you drill atleast 100 yds away from the rest of the group... I've read your reports detailing some of your past ""difficulties"" and I for one, would rather be part of the audience, then a particapant! LOL HH"
751564,ehg,2012-12-13 15:04:00,2666," Did that drive a lot back in the 90's when gas was about 42 cents a litre. Took about an hour Oshawa to Belleville. Found that Mr.Champ,Swedish Pimple, etc... needed to be tipped with emerald shiner hooked through back of head to stay on. Rip jig up, let it it flutter to bottom. Pause a bit then repeat.  Pt. Anne, Massasauga Pt. were good spots around Belleville. Mid to late February was a peak time to be out there. You have a good chance at a 10 lb+ walleye there more than any place. Good Luck"
751567,DoubleDigits,2012-12-13 15:08:00,140,"The trip can be really boring, especially if mom forgets the Spongebob DVD..."
