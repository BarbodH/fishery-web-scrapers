752311,Roy,2012-12-16 18:19:00,13728,You haven't a lot of time Ron....slow as in oven or slow as in crock pot?
752316,tb4me,2012-12-16 18:37:00,3295,I was thinking croc pot..She works till 630 so i was hoping for a 7pm dinner time
752317,mike rousseau,2012-12-16 18:37:00,4661,"I do most of my roasts the same way...,  -Preheat to 500 f. -Lightly season with garlic... Salt... Pepper.... And a bit of Montreal steak spice.... -place roast on a rack of some sort uncovered - put roast in oven then set at 350 f.  It will take a while for the oven to drop from 500 to 350... This creates a ""crust"" so to speak sealing in the juices.... Cook to a temperature that is to your doneness liking... (130-140 for me). Once your at the right temp...  Remove roast from oven and cover with tinfoil for 10-15 minutes....  Then carve and serve..."
752318,Leecher,2012-12-16 18:41:00,7832,"Ron,  I've never used a slow cooker but for venison a few basic ingredients are required to make it taste good and awesome!  Extra virgin olive oil, soy sauce, worcestershire sauce, garlic, oignon and celery, salt & pepper...  In a hot pan with a dab of butter, sear the beast on all sides   Drop it in a roasting container, chop / dice garlic, oignon and celeri... squirt /rub olive oil, soy & worcestershire sauce, add 2 cups of cold water and set your oven to 215F, cover and let it cook until your are ready to eat supper  Ever so often, take container out and use a spoon to sprinkle the beast with the cooking juices  Hope this helps! Jacques"
752324,Roy,2012-12-16 19:00:00,13728,"You haven't the time for crock pot. What size is the roast, I'll PM you something she'll like."
752327,tb4me,2012-12-16 19:08:00,3295,Roy its only a 3 pounder tops..Thanks to all for the tips! Ill post wich one I go with and that includes a dinner invite..lol
752332,Leecher,2012-12-16 19:27:00,7832,Better not waste any time Ron... you got 4 hours to cook the beast    Good luck to you and enjoy which ever way of cooking you decide to use!
752336,tb4me,2012-12-16 19:44:00,3295,"Ok Jacques..Can you make it here in under 4 hours? I just seared the ""beast"" in butter and put it in the oven @215.. I also saved the other ideas for next time..Mike do you actually cook the roast in the open the whole time or do you cover it eventually? I think id be more inclined to try that method with a beef roast..sounds good..Thanks again guys.. Roy id also love to see what ya have for recipies and ideas"
752337,Leecher,2012-12-16 19:49:00,7832, I got's some bourgignon in the oven right now   wish I lived closer    I'd be there in a heart beat    Enjoy your venison roast Ron
752345,Roy,2012-12-16 20:07:00,13728,PM sent.
752351,tb4me,2012-12-16 20:17:00,3295,"Thanks Roy, that sounds amazing..next sundays dinner perhaps..."
752387,craigdritchie,2012-12-16 22:21:00,1586,"It's hard to beat the crock pot for roasts. But they come out best if you can cook them on low heat for 10 - 12 hours.  Venison or, better yet, wild boar is just unbelievable when it's had time to slow cook."
752507,mike rousseau,2012-12-17 07:34:00,4661,"  Open the whole time... You only cover it at the end when you remove it from the oven... You cover with tinfoil for 10-15 minutes before carving....  I place a rack on a 2"" deep tray... I add some water to the tray to save the drippings from burning....  In the end I have to keep paper towel handy for the running juices flowing from the cutting board... Everyone that's eaten my roasts love em... It works great with beef... Chicken too.... My chicken literally bursts with juice when I cut it.....  Not saying its as good as it gets... But we like it..."
752531,Billy Bob,2012-12-17 13:03:00,5865,"No need to cook venison in a crock pot..actually a waste if you ask me...slow cooking is for tough cheap cuts of meat...like a pot roast.  For venison I have cooked MANY either in the oven or on a charcoal grill...trying to keep the heat to 300-350 degrees...but the whole trick is to only cook the roast to 130 degrees...a decent electronic probe left in the roast and monitored outside the BBQ or oven works the best...it's the only way I roast now.  I have also done several standing rib roast the exact same way....and BTW you only need to put 2-4 small incisions into either roast and then push some garlic deep into the roast....salt and pepper the outside of either roast and put it on the BBQ or in the over....  OH, I almost forgot......take the roast out of the fridge 2-5 HOURS before roasting depending on the size of the roast...you want that roast to get as close to room temp before roasting this will make sure that the roast in rare to med rare in the middle and not raw.  Time wise...figure about 20 minutes a pound...most venison roast are around 3 pounds, so only 1 hour to cook it to perfection if monitored with the electronic probe.  Enjoy and MERRY CHRISTMAS, Bob"
