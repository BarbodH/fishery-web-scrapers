751593,Tayzak15,2012-12-13 16:57:00,318, what model of lund did you buy? what was the dry weight of the boat?
751616,wormdunker,2012-12-13 18:41:00,1711,"I bought a 1996 big fisherman, it's 2"" wider than the new Lunds, weighs 265 lbs. Rides & steers very nicely.  It has 5 keel strips on the hull as well as splash rails on each side.  Most boats have only 3 keel strips,so U may want to consider this feature."
751621,ecmilley,2012-12-13 19:38:00,2163,can't go wrong with a lund or a smokercraft both built very good you get what you pay for.' as for most of the wide body boats they don't cut rough water very well and tend to pound .
751626,wormdunker,2012-12-13 20:27:00,1711,Should add it's 16 years old & doesn't leak a drop!  Used Lunds sell very quickly on kijiji & very few listed for sale!
751856,jimmer,2012-12-14 20:51:00,2730,"That's too bad, because when I purchased my newer 14 footer I had the transom cut down for my 25hp short shaft. I'm kicking myself now. I should have looked to replace the motor also. That lower transom is very close to the water line and very rough water definitely comes over the back. Those two choices are great. How can you wrong with either? I bought a 14' Smokercraft with the flat floor walk through with livewell. I like the boat, but it's definitely heavier than one with bench seats."
751863,Tayzak15,2012-12-14 21:26:00,318,"Recently, Ive also looked at the Lund WC 14ft model. Does anyone on here own one?  I would have to put a 15hp motor on it for the meantime is that too underpowered for 2 ppl?"
751958,wormdunker,2012-12-15 05:26:00,1711,"It would be under powered in my opinion.  As I stated above 30 hp, on my Lund, 1 person & gear 29 Mph.  2 guys & their gear 22 Mph.  The days of a 14' with 9.9 hp are gone unless it is a very lightweight boat.    The deep & wide are much heavier, more stable boats, downfall is they require more power.  Previously I owned a 14' gamefisher.  Much lighter boat.  My 15 hp Johnson was plenty fast enough. Hope this helps u make the right decision."
751962,Tayzak15,2012-12-15 05:43:00,318,That lund wc im looking at now says its only 25hp max though. However speed isn't too important to me. As long as it would push that boat 15-20 mph with 2 ppl I would be OK with that until I upgrade motors.
752150,johndox,2012-12-16 02:45:00,54,"I have a 2001 Lund WC14 and it had an older evinrude 25 on it when I got it and it was a good size for the boat at top speed bot too much to troll with so I traded it for a 20 and now it takes a bit longer to get where im going but it trolls nicer. The boat itself is great I was looking for something like you just bare bones and I could dress it up like I wanted it. Nice and wide and deep, we use it on the lakes around Timmins often."
752151,Tayzak15,2012-12-16 02:50:00,318," Oh your from timmins john? I guess you could familiarize with me here then. I do a lot of trolling and I would be using this boat on the Matagami, Kenogamissi,Scorch, plus some lakes down the foleyet timber road and pine street. You're saying a 15 would be fine on it? I don't mind taking a little longer to get to my spot as long as the boat can plane properly. Slow trolling speeds are more important than top speed for me. You said you have the WC? what lakes do you take it on in the area?"
751027,Tayzak15,2012-12-11 18:09:00,318,"So next summer, I plan on upgrading to a deep and wide 14 footer. Currently I have an older(early 70's) 14ft starcraft car topper hooked up with an early 90's evinrude 15hp. Im only 21 years old and I've had that setup for 2 years and absolutely loved it. Only thing was it was a little scary to get caught in rough water with it. I live up in the North (timmins), and I'm out on the water during the summer 4-5 times per week. So I need a boat that can take a bit of a pounding and hit a few rocks here and there accidentally as well. Currently, I have been looking at the Lund WD 14 foot and the Naden 14ft Fisherman model. I just want to get feedback from people who either own these boats or may suggest another model. The 3 most important things for me when I buy this new boat are aluminum thickness,depth and width. I dont need any bell's and whistles in it. I must also mention I do plan on buying a newer motor in the net couple of years as well, (anything from 2007 on either 15hp or 20hp) I'd love to hear peoples opinions to help me gain a bit of knowledge when I buy in the spring. Thanks!"
751028,BillM,2012-12-11 18:15:00,17367,"We had a Legend 15ft Widebody before our current Lund and I've got absolutely ZERO complaints with it.  Handled the rough water better then any other smaller tiller I've been in.  Nice and wide and stable, combined that with a 40 4-stroke Honda and it would rip..   Loved that boat, wasn't very expensive either."
751031,solopaddler,2012-12-11 18:21:00,8605,"Well, if you're looking to buy local you might want to consider a Naden boat. There's a reason why most outfitters in Ontario use them, they're incredibly durable.  They're made in Temagami now I believe and Irishfield on the board is involved. He'd be a good guy to talk to."
751034,Joeytier,2012-12-11 18:35:00,3990,What he said!

What is the price range for the Naden Fisherman Model? I looked at your link from a long time ago is this boat in the link the 14ft fisherman model? http://ontariofishingcommunity.com/forums/index.php?showtopic=65859  "
751045,irishfield,2012-12-11 18:58:00,26272,"Sorry, you'll have to get a price quote through a dealer... I don't have access to that side of things. (well I do.. just can't share it in the open and tick off any dealers)  Yes... the green boat in that thread is the 14 foot fisherman model. The red on is the 16' Big Fish.  Wayne"
751054,Tayzak15,2012-12-11 19:06:00,318," Oh kk perfect, cause I love the depth of that green one in the pics, that's fine if you can't share the price I have a budget for buying a new one and Im positive itl fit within it."
751056,206,2012-12-11 19:13:00,563,"I have a 16 foot starfish from Princecraft....nice and wide, well built. Just basic but I love it.  Worth a look"
751057,Terry,2012-12-11 19:15:00,14456,On fly ins  everyone fought over who would get the naden boat was by far the most stable boats in the fleet
751059,Tayzak15,2012-12-11 19:23:00,318," How would a 15hp run on this 14 ft model with 2 ppl, and just basic fishing gear, would you have any estimate?"
751061,Tootsie II,2012-12-11 19:24:00,162,"I bought a 14 ft Naden Canadian Laker in 2007. It's the wider and deeper 14 footer. In short I love it. It can take rough water and as my fishing partner do a two week trip to Sinclair Lake every summer and we camp away from the landings, it can haul a hell of a jag. It's rated for a 35 hp and I have a two stroke 30hp Johnson on it.  Putting a 4 stroke on it might lower the horsepower rating as I understand that Transport Canad has just woke up to the fact that 4 strokes are quite a bit heavier than 2 trokes and some boats may have their max HP rating lowered. It can really fly when it's light. The one thing I would do different is that I would buy one with the 20"" transom. At the time I had bought the 30 hp two years earlier so I had to stick with the 15"" lower transom. It's also still reasonably lightweight (235 lbs.) so that on two of our other trips it rides on top of my camper trailer with a special rack that I had built."
751064,Lip-ripper,2012-12-11 19:31:00,228,"Of the 2 models you listed, personally I'd go with the Lund. I have driven both and find that the Lund's handle better. I found that the design of the Naden had a little too blunt of a nose and wouldn't handle driving in the direction of the waves as good as the Lund did. It would almost seem to plow too much and I found it tough to handle and keep straight. If you bring up photos of the 2 models, you'll see what I mean by a blunter design and the front.  As for addressing the specs you are interested in, I believe the aluminum thicknesses are the same, with the Lund being the deeper and wider boat."
751100,Roe Bag,2012-12-11 21:32:00,246,"My buddy bought a Polar Kraft this year. No more horsepower rating. Instead. Maximum engine weight. 15' with a 15"" transom. Maximum engine weight 125 lbs. His 25 Yamaha two stroke makes it just under the wire. A twenty five four would be roughly 30 lbs over weight."
751136,trevy727,2012-12-11 23:01:00,351,"No matter what boat you choose, I definately also recommend the 20 inch transom."
751146,Tayzak15,2012-12-11 23:45:00,318," Unfortunately for me, a 20 Inch transom is kind of our of the question. The motor i have now is a short shaft, and unless I can get a good used deal on a 15 longshaft early next summer"
751156,GYPSY400,2012-12-12 00:11:00,191,"I recently purchased a 16 ft Legend prosport.. And the 20"" transom is "" literally"" a lifesaver when trolling with the stern to the wind.. I've had a few instances where the waves were really close, and if I had the 15"" transom, I'd be bailing. Also the 16 ft is nice for the rough water, rides better than the shorter boat.. If your not planning on hand bombing to the water, consider it.  Not knocking the Naden or Lund, both excellent choices .. But have a look at the legend.. One of the thickest hulls in the industry.. they are made by Starcraft.  Not sure of your finances, but You might also want to consider buying a package if your going to bite the bullet.  Its really nice when your motor runs well on your new dry boat.. And the trailer gets you to the lake and back home without the wheels falling off I was in the same situation last year.. Wanted a new motor, but was tired of the leaky boat and broken trailer..  Now I'm good until I'm 50."
751160,Luke V.,2012-12-12 00:23:00,286,"I'm running a 2001 14' Starcraft sf14.  I love this boat! At the time it was one of the widest and deepest boats in a 14 footer. It has the 20"" transom. And after re-powering it 3 years ago it got even better. With the Merc 25 HP 2-stroke running a full tank of fuel large deep cell battery and enough gear for two people in running 27.5 Mph.  I have no experience with the Naden. So no comment there.  Good luck with your hunt!! I also would not be afraid at looking at a used boat. As far as tinners go a few hours of cleaning and she looks brand new! Check the rivets and your off to the water!!"
751163,Tayzak15,2012-12-12 00:32:00,318," Yeah I have no problem, buying used! Im just looking for something deep and wide, since all I have right now is an old starcraft from the early 70's thats starting to leak a bit and is fairly narrow and shallow. The trailer I have it on is good quality, just replaced the bearings and tires last summer, and the motor I have the early 90's evinrude 15 still runs pretty good. Takes about 3 pulls on a cold start and 1 pull every other time, however I know itl be time to upgrade it within a couple years. If i could get a deep and wide 14ft aluminum with a 15hp or bigger motor that's relatively new say 7-10 years or younger for around 3500$ I would jump right on it, as long as there's no defects."
751334,206,2012-12-12 18:53:00,563," Buy a quality boat with the 15inch trans and it will have a ""Full-width self-draining splashwell"" as my princecraft has....no need to worry about bailing."
751421,waterwolf,2012-12-12 23:38:00,556, how about an 87 evinrude 20 hp long for 500? my buddy has one in his garage and needs the space . i would buy it but i need a short shaft argggh!
751441,Tayzak15,2012-12-13 00:50:00,318, How does it run? does he have any recent compression ratings from it?
751586,wormdunker,2012-12-13 16:30:00,1711,"I bought a 14' Lund this past summer.  Absolutely love it!  It's powered with a 30Hp Suzuki, goes 29 mph with me & my gear.  I think a 15 would be a little slow, especially with 2 guys & their gear, but that's my opinion. I would also suggest a bount mount electric if u plan to do some trolling.  I also purchased the bow mount with the ipilot (remote control).  I can control the motor from any position in the boat.  Love the Lund & the ipilot.  Good luck shopping"
