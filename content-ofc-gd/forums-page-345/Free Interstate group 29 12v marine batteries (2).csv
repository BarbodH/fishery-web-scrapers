753044,Steve,2012-12-18 22:56:00,2075,"Due to my winter use of batteries, I purchase new 12v deep cycle batteries every two seasons.  I'm due to purchase two new batteries this winter, so I have 2 Interstate SRM29 Deep Cycle 12v batteries *free* if anyone would like to pick them up.  I'm in Hamilton, but work in Mississauga.  Because I do frequently update my deep cycle batteries, these are only a few years old. I'll keep my current ones as backup to the two new ones, however, I don't need my current backup set.  They are kept charged at all times.  They likely are at about 70%-75% capacity,compared to a new battery.  Reply here or Msg me."
