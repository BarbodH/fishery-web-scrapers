752968,craigdritchie,2012-12-18 18:20:00,1586,Well that settles it. I'm not paying the bills till next week.
752970,Woodsman,2012-12-18 18:24:00,1286,Might as well pay them or even better have one hell of a party. Can't take it with you.
752699,BucktownAngler,2012-12-17 22:59:00,582,"im still fairly new to ice fishing but this has been my best/most productive ice fishing lure so far. also worked well in soft water.  i found out this lure was discontinued and couldnt find it anywhere or online from Northland. but lucked out and managed to find a few locally.     also picked up this bucket top tackle box      and i also picked up some Lindy darters. havent used them before, but have heard good things, so ill be giving them a go this year.   anybody else have any go to baits to recommend?"
752701,bobowski,2012-12-17 23:07:00,360,Those Airplane Jigs look pretty similar to Jiggin Raps. Jiggin Raps are my go to lure on the ice. Big ones tipped with a minnow can be deadly on Walleye under the right conditions.
752717,Muskieman,2012-12-17 23:42:00,2472,"There isn't a better jig on the market with the capability to twist your line like the Airplane has . Use a quality in line barrel swivel about 10"" above the Airplane , it will help ( a little ) to reduce line twist ... but when they work they work well ."
752721,trapshooter,2012-12-17 23:46:00,1234,"Jigging Raps are a top producer up here.  Catch everything under the ice!  The Lindy Darter is another favourite of mine.  I always start with it and if the fish are active/aggressive they will hit it.  If they aren't I usually go to something I can tip with a minnow.  I've caught everything on the darter though... walleye, pike, whitefish, burbot and my biggest bass and laker ever on the Lindy Darter.  I always have a rod rigged up with a darter on it.  Good luck this winter!"
752724,DRIFTER_016,2012-12-17 23:50:00,10439, I have caught a bunch of fish on the darter too. I have a couple of dozen of them. I also tip them with a chunk of cisco with good luck.  My other go to lure are the Northland Airplane jigs (the big ones not those babies the OP has) I also tip them with a slab of meat. This one is my favorite.  
752754,big guy,2012-12-18 00:28:00,414,"A white airplane jig tipped with a minnow was my go to lake trout lure for years, great lure"
752786,craigdritchie,2012-12-18 01:21:00,1586,"Yup, except the Airplane jig pre-dates the Rapala by about 30 years.  I bought my first Airplane jigs from the Outdoor Stores in Toronto back in the mid 1970s, years before Northland bought the company that produced them and acquired manufacturing rights. I believe they were originally made by a small company located near North Bay, but am not 100 percent certain.  In any case, they're excellent lures. As mentioned, use a barrel swivel about a foot up your line from the lure to avoid line twist problems."
752797,Roy,2012-12-18 01:41:00,13728," Yeah originally Quetico Tackle Atikokan, Ontario maybe. I've got one or two used ones left. But yes, they were a bugger at line twist."
752798,DRIFTER_016,2012-12-18 01:48:00,10439, Like the one on the right in this picture? I have a couple in my box still.  
752799,big guy,2012-12-18 01:55:00,414," Yep the one on the right is what I have as well, white with red thread. I took the trebles off though, but added a single stinger off the main hook for short strikes"
752800,craigdritchie,2012-12-18 01:55:00,1586,"Quetico tackle sounds right. And yes, Dave, that's the bait. I have a few of the same ones, including a few in the same colour too."
752803,Roy,2012-12-18 01:59:00,13728,You should repaint them in the Air Canada pattern. It might sink more quickly.
752805,Muskieman,2012-12-18 02:01:00,2472,  LOL !
752808,Fisherman,2012-12-18 02:09:00,7201,"They work really well when you have some ignorant jerk drilling holes right next to you, just make sure your line is tougher than theirs."
752810,DRIFTER_016,2012-12-18 02:12:00,10439," NAH, then it will just complain and offer poor service!!!!"
752812,BillM,2012-12-18 02:13:00,17367, Craig's got icefishing jigs?  Has there been a glitch in the Matrix?   :)
752815,DRIFTER_016,2012-12-18 02:25:00,10439, There has been a rip in the space/time continuum and the only way to repair it is for Craig to mail those airplane jigs to me!!!  They must be in the mail before Friday or.....................................
752816,BillM,2012-12-18 02:26:00,17367," You've got enough!  I will be the guy nice here and take them off his hands, lol!"
752856,Woodsman,2012-12-18 05:41:00,1286, LOL I actually have a couple exactly the same as these. But then that could be expected as it's my photo you posted.
752899,lhousesoccer,2012-12-18 14:27:00,442,I thought airplane jigs went the way of the Banjo Minnow .....
752904,craigdritchie,2012-12-18 14:49:00,1586," Steady there Bill. You can vertically jig out of a boat too.  Ice fishing? Been there, done that, got the frozen t-shirt. Never again, not even at gunpoint."
752905,craigdritchie,2012-12-18 14:50:00,1586,"Dave - um ..... no. Still vertically jig in open water, so sorry friend, they need to stay here in the sunny south.  Well, not very sunny today but you get the point."
752916,DRIFTER_016,2012-12-18 15:38:00,10439, Well that's just great!!!! You've doomed us all!!!! See you on the other side on Friday there Craig!!! Hope those jigs won't melt where we're all going.
752922,craigdritchie,2012-12-18 16:03:00,1586,Florida?
752929,BillM,2012-12-18 16:15:00,17367, LOL!!!!!!!!!
