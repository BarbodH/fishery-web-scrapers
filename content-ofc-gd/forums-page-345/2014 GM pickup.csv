751751,16 Footer,2012-12-14 12:15:00,191, It is 17 to 18 miles per US gallon.
751752,wkrp,2012-12-14 12:18:00,656,I am now on my second Sierra and will definately go for a third  . These trucks are bulletproof.Besides whats a few liters of fuel between fishermen.

751759,Fish4Eyes,2012-12-14 13:00:00,1022, Fuel economy is nothing special on the Taureg TDI. I had one for about a week and pulled my light 1200lb ish rig and I got about 13L/100km on relatively flat terrain. My 96 4Runner gets about the same.
751760,NAW,2012-12-14 13:09:00,4022,"Hey Lew, maybe I'm not remembering right, but I thought you just bought a new F150?  Is it not working out for you?  That 2014 looks SLICK.  My brother in law has been a F150 guy his hole life.  He's also looking at the new Chevy."
751761,lew,2012-12-14 13:20:00,12766," Yup, just bought another new F150 in October and it's an excellent truck and I'm very happy with it.  I just found that link to the 2014 Chevy's and know there's lotsa guys on this board who like them so thought I'd put it up for them.  My BnL buys a new 2500 GM pick-up every 2 years and swears by them."
751778,RangerGuy,2012-12-14 14:48:00,564,"Hey Lew, nothing against your BnL but if you get a new truck every 2 years.. I'd bet every manufacture would seem good LOL! It's after 100,000 km where a vehicles reliablity starts to shine or burn hehehe!  I'm starting the shopping process now, and was thinking of a ford as well. I just like the trucks, but I'm not against GM either."
751779,RangerGuy,2012-12-14 14:52:00,564,"  Hey Irishfield,  Ford 5.0 Coyote engine is that a nickname or a model name?  Sorry, I've not paid very close attention to what is out right now as I always had old vehicle, my last truck was a 90' Single Cab 5-speed Chevy with a 350, which was recently put down. So now I'm looking at a new truck this winter.  RIP Blue beast, I miss you hahaha!"
751780,Moosebunk,2012-12-14 14:55:00,3970,"Hoping in a small way that my 99 Silverado gives up.  It's not cool to look so uncool driving something that old ya know, but it's about the memories.  Man... first 100,000km on washboard, potholed and ice roads.  Stuck in 4WD pretty well all winters long, and at least a few times a year over the decade, jolted to death when strapped tight to a chain car on the Polar Bear Express.  Poor truck has thrice been stopped dead when the front end went twice through the ice and once into a culvert, but she drove out in 4WD.  Wifey sure beats it too, every winter on the Diamond Mine Road across the skeg to Attawapiskat, 600km's at 80-120km/hr in 4WD... Ughhh... even my rear diff puckers up with the thought!  Had to Replace the shocks once, brakes once and a couple ball joints after that rough stretch offroadin'.  ""Like A Rock""... they sing.  Second 100,000km has been easier just towing my boats, quad and skidoo all over the place.  Some city miles too these days, just idling away.  Four trips to ThunderBay towing everything and the kitchen sink, more than a dozen runs to Cochrane.  Truck won't quit.  Nowadays brakes and ball joints aren't a worry though.  The kid spraying the undercoat on her this week; after he finished the B-Boy's shiney  pimped out RAM remarked, ""geez, they sure put alot of metal into these old trucks.""  He reminded me she's old.  Paid it off in 2001 and it's been nickle and diming me now for 12 years.  Cost me $640 in minor repairs just this year, pretty well screwing the kid's Christmas and college funds.  When will she just turn over and die already??  Babied at only 210,000km really.  Not likely very soon.   New one's look great Lew, although all they need for me is the stamina and a comfortable drivers seat.  I'm with Rich too, they're boxy again, kinda like the Ford but much sexier.  Will call them the new ""Fevy"" then."
751781,lew,2012-12-14 14:56:00,12766," Just shows how much he likes GM's Greg, he's always had them and likes to always have new ones.  And Drew, it  doesn't sound like that old girl owes you too much."
751784,RangerGuy,2012-12-14 15:10:00,564,"Moosebunk, they don't make'm like that anymore. I bet if you beat a new one like that it wouldn't make 100,000 K let alone 200,000+  It was a hard descision to give my old girl, but when a truck dies infront of a wreckers. I do believe it was trying to tell me something HAHA!   I like'm to Lew   But after driv'n down to Georgia in a F-150 Lariat.. I was sold. Mind you everything is more comfortable to drive long distance than an old worn out pick up bench seat HAHA!   I got to drive a GMC 3500 down south, just out to a field and let me tell you. I""m 6' and felt small it in HAHA! Those things are HUGE!"
751785,DRIFTER_016,2012-12-14 15:45:00,10439,I bought a GM once. Won't make that mistake again.  I'm patiently waiting for the Chicago Auto Show in February to see what Toyota does with the redesigned 2014 Tundra since I'm thinkin' of replacing the old Honda in 2013.

I see 10-12 on the hwy at a steady 105-110 depending on headwind and season.  sounds like anything capable of towing is right around the same range.. 10-13.  was thinking these newer models were considerably better.  I guess not.. even if they are 1-2 l/100 better, that's a lot of liters/long return on investment to justify a new car payment."
751935,Dutch,2012-12-15 02:30:00,831,"Took a look at the photos - doesn't seem to be too much of a change in the body styling from the 2008-2013 model.  It is a pretty tired design in my opinion.  As far as gas mileage goes - who cares, it's a truck."
751976,fishindevil,2012-12-15 11:03:00,6254,It's not that I care what mileage my new truck gets !!!! It was about what the makers are saying they get ?? And it seems they are way off but I don't care about my gas mileage cause that's not why I bought a new truck at least I know I can get to  rough boat launches and tow my sleds to just about anywhere and can tow several thousand pounds without any problems and drive through deep snow if I wanted gas mileage I would be driving a small car that's not much good for anything other than commuting ....I think the new trucks look awesome and there is some nice changes as well !!!!

751663,bigbuck,2012-12-13 22:44:00,2449,"They are all full of it when it comes to fuel economy. RAM pickups getting 36mpg, which one? The HEMI or the smallest available engine? The TV spot doesn't really make that too clear. If you want to get the mpg numbers advertised, you need no load, only a driver, a/c off, pretend there is a bomb under the gas pedal that will go off if you press it hard and don't go over 105kp/h and maintain a steady speed. I've gotten 30mpg (us gallon) in our minivan coming back from HH keeping to 105kp/h. That's better than the 26mpg that was advertised. BUT I was bored and HAD to maintain a very very light foot on the gas."
751665,BillM,2012-12-13 22:56:00,17367, New 6cyl with the 8spd auto tranny  I'm assuming they sourced that from Mercedes.

751676,Kingsalmon,2012-12-13 23:46:00,107,I'm disappointed that they didn't include a light duty diesel option.  Who are they kidding?  Diesels rule!

They said it was the largest discrepancy between what automakers MPG claims and the actual real-world driving results.    While driving to Roy's for a vist one time we got this in our GMC Duromax Diesel     "
751681,RickOnt,2012-12-14 00:11:00,669,13.5L per 100km  is about 21MPG  Rick
751687,fishindevil,2012-12-14 00:27:00,6254,Thanks rickOnt I wasn't sure but that's what I have been averaging for a month the dealer said it will get better once its broken in !! But it's still way better than my ford ranger V6. But yes those new style 2014 trucks look awesome !!!! So I'm wondering if that's what the truck with the 4.7 gets maybe its the one that gets 30mpg ??? Maybe if I drove at 30kph all the time it would get 30 hahaha I don't know how they get their miles per gallon rating ?? Probly on an oval track just going around real slow not real world driving like stop lights and hills or traffic or driving into a 40mph headwind haha
751689,kickingfrog,2012-12-14 00:34:00,8333,I know what you were getting at but slower speed doesn't mean better fuel economy. For most vehicles the best use of fuel versus distance is usually 80-100 kph depending on gearing and vehicle size.  Idling in the drive thru is always zero miles per gallon.
751691,BillM,2012-12-14 00:39:00,17367," Agreed, take 2 cyls off the Duramax and make it a 6 banger.  It still would make a tonne of hp/trq and probably get mid to high 20's (US MPG) in mileage."
