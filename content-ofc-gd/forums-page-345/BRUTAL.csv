BUT, a tragic event does not justify knee jerk reactions like all these bleeding hearts suggest.   this is simply another case of the media publishing the wrong information while trying to make ""black"" guns look evil. an AR15 is NOT an assault rifle, but it is similar to the fully automatic M16. for you people that haven't been around firearms, the AR15 used in this shooting is NO DIFFERENT than your grandpa's semi auto deer/moose hunting rifle in that both require you to pull the trigger once per shot. it was chambered in .223, a round the majority of hunters wouldn't use on anything bigger than a coyote.  the AR15 functions EXACTLY the same as an M1 Garand from WWII as they're both SEMI auto, not FULL auto.   seriously? this is the type on mentality legal firearms owners fight every day. you're suggesting i put a picture of a dead child on my target the next time i shoot my guns? people die every day due to drunk driving, but i highly doubt any of you would even consider the thought of stopping the sale of alcohol to the public and give up their hobby of drinking because it could save a life somewhere  this is the type of knee jerk reaction i mentioned above   this is something the anti gun folk are missing, yet they're blaming gun laws for what happened. suggesting that stricter firearms laws will stop shootings makes as much sense as saying stricter regulations to get your drivers license will stop people from stealing cars.    as for those who believe firearms cause more harm than good. i suggest you look at some facts and you will learn that crime rates dropped in nearly every state after CCW was introduced. but, seeing as it's the canadian way to be good victims and we're told to be good little sheep, i don't expect many of you to agree with this"

I have read this argument many times and what those that make this statement forget is that at the time the rifled musket was the second most powerful weapon on the planet. That amendment put enormous power and responsibility in the hands of the individual.With one of these weapons  one could do the unthinkable, like defying a king or killing a lord.

No. But it happens more often than mass shootings do. In Canada your right to bear arms in protection is an extremely slippery legal slope. Something that I feel should change. In the US it is legal to do such a thing. Two of my co workers recently had there houses broken into while they were home. Both are now seeking out getting there firearms licenses and are learning about firearms. I would suggest to you that until you have something happen to you that you should keep your own fear mongering and name calling to yourself. You don't know my life's history nor do you even know me in person.  Where exactly are you getting your facts of %.000001 of people that have been threatened in there own homes? That is pure falsehood and lies. Something that anti gun people are good at. Instead of looking at actual fact they tend to just make it up to suit there own emotional needs.

I also find it funny you think I'm anti gun as well, I actually just picked up a nice Savage .270 from Epps last week (And not to protect myself with either, lol living in fear)  I'm anti fear mongering, trying to make people think they aren't safe in their own homes.

There is no fear mongering, and I know exactly where I am in fact I stated in my response that in the US people are allowed and that in Canada your not. I do support the use of firearms as protection in Canada. I would not support the use of a centralized weapons cache for that very reason.  Do you actually believe that all firearms would be stored in such a weapons cache? Do you actually think that the government would be able to fund such a facility where the people would be questioned each time they go to get one out for cleaning, maintenance, range use, just to look at, to go hunting, to take pictures of to trade or sell etc...  Some anti's do own guns. Those people are considered hypocrites by many. Why don't you lead the charge and take your new gun and go store it at a gun club, then go give the key to your locker to a third party and pay them to question you if you want to gain access to it."

752536,blarg,2012-12-17 13:20:00,289,"  Right..see this is exactly the problem, make a choice, are you interested in saving lives?  Why aren't you crusading for prohibition then, sure it would suck that you can't have a beer and watch the game, but it would save lives, more than banning a particular type of firearm. It's a small sacrifice but hey, im sure it would save at least ONE innocent life.  This is too simplistic of an argument, there are lots of things we could do differently, but what kind of society do you want to live in?  The reality is, as terrible as these killings are, they make up a very small percentage of the overall homicide rate, and i don't care if you ban ""assault rifles"" (though they almost always aren't, they just look the part), but there will still be thousands of people shot every year with handguns, which make up a huge portion of homicides in the states, those are not going to be banned.  http://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/crime-in-the-u.s/2010/crime-in-the-u.s.-2010/tables/10tbl20.xls  That table tells the story.  Anything they do will almost certainly be more for public relations than anything else, get rid of the 'black guns' get rid of the semi auto rifles, and you still have the weapon of choice in most homicides and it's impossible to imagine that hand guns are going anywhere in the US.  So an important question to ask is, Do you want to save lives, or are you simply anti gun and want to ban whatever you can?  Now not you personally, but the cold fact is that simply because these were children, and teachers, and they were shot all at once by a nut with an AR variant, their lives and deaths are no more or less valuable than another innocent shot with a hand gun, or killed by a drunk driver.  If you want to save lives there are many other ways to be more effective than banning ""assault rifles"".  For a lot of people involved in this argument a starting point of complete bias against the gun leads them down one path."
752537,DoubleDigits,2012-12-17 13:30:00,140, I don't have a complete bias against the gun. I plan to get my PAL in the next few months. I suspect that the others who have voiced concern about these weapons also aren't anti-gun...
752538,jedimaster,2012-12-17 13:32:00,3472,In canada an ar15 is able to be owned however the magazines must be pinned so they can only hold 5rounds if its a .223 magazine and a 10rounds if it has been adapted to shoot pistol rounds. Things to consider hear. What is it exactly people have an issue with the ar15?  The bullet? Well a.223 or 5.56 nato is certainly no more dangerous than any other  bullet out there in common use and is in fact very tame in comparison.  Is it the capacity? Extended 30 round magazines are commonly available for many semi automatic rifles out there.  If ar15's were banned and literally wiped off the face of the planet people would just buy or make extended magazines for other guns.  I am not saying nothing should be done but whatever is done shouldn't be directed towards an object that in reality is no more dangerous than any other firearm. I mean what if he used a pump shotgun with buckshot that used a magazine? I think more would have been killed.  Perhaps its just the looks of the ar15 that scares people. Canada has a scary gun list and what has that done to prevent mass shootings here? They don't happen as often heard as in the states but they never have.  Lets say you ban ar15 rifles. People will just use  remington or ruger semi auto. What if you ban semi auto rifles. People will use pump action rifles and shotguns What if you ban high capacity magazines? People will just make them or modify them. The point isn't to do nothing its that making changes like this is worse than doing nothing. Its putting false security into peoples heads. Do something useful. It sounded like Obama is going to do something. I watched the entire memorial last night and he certainly indicated changes must be made. Hopefully its something that will actually make a difference.

752548,Dave Bailey,2012-12-17 14:29:00,1641,"My thoughts on Friday's tragedy. I am NOT against gun ownership and hunting, but I am against the gun mentality, and the idea that anyone should be able to get anything.  The 2nd amendment argument is garbage. When it was drafted the only firearms were muzzle-loaders, not assault rifles with 30 round clips. And despite what the NRA tries to instill in people's minds, it isn't inviolate. Amendments are able to themselves be amended, in fact it's been done. Prohibition was a constitutional amendment that was repealed with another amendment.  People also like to scream that registration is the first step in taking away your guns. More garbage. We've been registering cars, aircraft, and powerboats, for a century, I haven't seen any attempts to take them away. It's just scare-mongering to trick the stupid and gullible. Yes, I know our gun registry was a financial boondoggle, but it didn't need to be, that was just typical bureaucratic mismanagment (And since I know one of the guys in charge I speak with some knowledge of just how inefficient he can be. I also trained him on the use of the FN C2 when I was in the army reserve, and he's dangerous around weapons).  And forget those who say that automatic weapons are the problem, so we can restrict everyone to semi-autos and everything will be okay. That only applies to some weapons. I carried an FN 7.62mm C1A1 for 10 years, and one of the first things every Canadian infantryman learned to do was turn it from semi-auto to full-auto in a few minutes with the simple placement of a piece of folded paper in the trigger group. Ditto for restricting magazine size, we would use gunner's tape to double-mag or even triple-mag for faster reloads.  Finally, I don't buy the argument that the citizens need to be armed in order to prevent the government from getting out of control. Unless you want to argue for private ownership of B-2 bombers, F-15 Strike Eagles, Apache helicopters, M1 Abrams tanks, and all the munitions that go with these weapons systems (and the NRA probably would lobby for such possession), then you're not going to do much when your rag-tag gang of drunken hillbillies goes up against a professional armed forces that will vastly outnumber you.  Most of the excuses are just pulled out the asses of people who are so paranoid of everything around them that they feel the need to swagger around with a gun, as if it makes them tough. Truth be told, if someone started shooting most of them would forget they had a weapon, they would be too busy crapping their pants and crying. Most of them think they are carrying it in case they need to use it, when actually they are carrying it as a security blanket. And a blanket won't stop a bullet."
752551,jedimaster,2012-12-17 14:43:00,3472," In 2009 there were 12,000 gun murders In 2009 there were 10,839 deaths in the US by drunk drivers alone In 2009 there were 33,808 deaths in the US by car  Better get a sticker on you steering wheel, and ban alcohol. Make driving drunk illegal, oh wait it already is. The point is, by making something illegal you don't stop it from happening.  Some stats to be more specific...  268 deaths by a firearm in in 2009 in the US to children under the age 14 704 deaths by drowning in 2009 in the US to children under the age 14 3215 deaths by transport and motor vehicle  in 2009 to children under the age of 14  Why not ban all swimming pools and put fences aroung every lake, pond, ocean and stream? Why not Ban all vehicles? How many motor boat deaths were there? Why not ban motor boats? What about canoes? Lets ban those as I am sure people have died falling out of canoes. What about tigers and elephants, lets kill all of those because they have killed people too. What about ropes? People use those to kill themselves, lets ban ropes.  Actually I think its safer if everyone just lives in there houses, locked up in bullet proof and bomb proof dungeons and then they just control robots to live there lives outside.  I am certainly not trying to minimalize the tragedy that happened but a kneejerk reaction like lets ban some guns is just ridiculas.  The reality is a guy went bonkers, stole some guns(I though he bought them but that report on the news turned out to be false) and shot a bunch of kids. So very sad, but banning guns isn't going to stop gun violence and it isn't going to stop people from being killed, and it isn't going to make people feel safer. In fact in Australia since the banned all semi auto's the stats on safety have gone down. People feel less safe now than they did before semi's weere banned."

752555,doubleheader,2012-12-17 15:07:00,497,"I'm not sure you can draw many conclusions as to root cause from this one event, but looking at the collective history of these types of events over the last 20 years I think one can if not understand root cause certainly develop a list of likely root causes, the degree to which each one plays a role is probably incident specific.  1. Unsupervised access to handguns and rifles. I'm a gun owner, in fact I have a conceal carry permit. To me it's inconceivable that kids are allowed unsupervised access to guns, ammunition, explosives, and so on. 2. Unsupervised and continuous access to violent video games. No one can convince me that playing these games hour after hour after hour doesn't desensitize the most vulnerable and ""most likely"" youths of the world. 3. A cultural fascination with violence. American Tv is filled with some of the most heinous and realistic murder shows. Case in point, anyone ever watch Criminal Minds? It's ridiculously realistic and savage. I stopped watching it because it's just too realistic. Why do they make shows like this? Because people watch. The same reason this tragic event will get top billing for weeks on end. I'm not saying the media should ignore this tragedy, but, at what point does the coverage only serve to inflate ratings, satisfy our fascination. Then there will be books, and likely a movie. This whole ""circus"" must spawn ideas to cop or even out due. A viscous cycle. 4. Lack of sufficient mental health care. Many parents report their kids to authorities because they fear they may be capable of something like this. Most generally they can't get help until the kid does something serious. 5. Drugs and alcohol. Prescription drugs or street drugs must be a contributing factor. 6. Jealousy and a general lack of respect for your neighbor. In the US our most recent Presidential election was over the top. For months we were bombarded with the name calling. I believe there is a trickle down effect.  There are surely many other contributing factors to these type of crimes, and maybe some of what I have on my list is off base. Food for thought; we have some 300 million in the US, maybe only 3 million of them have some sort of mental issue health issue that under the right circumstances make them susceptible to commit violent acts, maybe 10% of those play videos hours on end maybe only 1 in 1000 of those have access to weapons. That's 300 potential mass murderers at any given time, 300 time bombs. Obviously it's not this cut and dry in the real world, but it makes me wonder if there really ever can be a solution without a major change in our culture."

Not everyone will choose to cower in the corner.  You say you are not against gun ownership, so what is it that you are offering as a possible step towards a solution? Are you suggesting that people only be allowed to own muzzle loaders? Are you saying there should be a gun registry? The firearms used were stolen. They were not his.

752231,lew,2012-12-16 15:38:00,12766,"This was a terrible tragedy and it's hard to even comprehend how anyone could do it, but I also think it's good to hear everyones different thoughts on it.  I'm like Kemper though, as I'm sure most Canadians are too, and the thought of everyone walking around with loaded handguns is just something that's so foreign to us in this country.  I read alot of the different American boards, as I'm sure many here do too, and I just can't get over their love affair with handguns. These guys are carrying them on their belt's, in the truck and some guys even carry them in the boat when they go fishing.  Personally, I just don't get it.  Some of the responses on the other boards are pretty scary too.  Guys are suggesting shotguns be kept in every classroom, all teachers should be armed with handguns and one guy even said it should be mandatory for EVERY sane person in the US over 21 to carry a loaded handgun at all times.  Can you just imagine a gunfight between teachers and whaco's in a school hallway full of children ??  Toronto is the biggest city in Canada with a population of 2.5 million people, yet only 50-60 murders are committed every year and their mostly gang bangers killing each other with illegal guns smuggled in from the States.  I don't mean this as a slam against Americans, it's just that our 2 countries are similar in many ways, but VERY different in others.  I MUCH prefer our system, but that's just me."

It's in their Constitution and that's basically as sacred as one can get so I understand their stance.  fwiw, a friend was transferred to Miami a number of years ago and one thing he had to consider was whether or not to pack a handgun or not. I presume this was suggested by co-workers and I don't believe he chose that option."

The Washington puppets will just show fake sorrow attitude and this will be forget in no time. Small elite make business (read big bucks/profit) and the rest of 300 million suckers have to live in fear. So much corruption and ipocrisy in this country I can't believe it. Same crap in food industry, pharmaceutical, health.  The amerloc (american loco) citizen deserve this, because they chose it.  After this incident most probably they will say the kids should carry guns in schools to be able to defend themselves. A society leads by profiteers. I hope this trend and philosophy of live stay out of Canada.  PS: I do have military training and I lived on my skin what means to be in a close range (less than 10 meters) when and idiot decide to fire an AK47 to kill himself. Luckily the direction of the bullet ended up in a concrete wall and not in our platoon line formation. I was 18 years old at that time and definitely want to live. That day I really felt that I am living on borrowed time, the Connecticut incident and any shooting in Toronto just bring me back the memories that I want to forget.  So live safe, appreciate your freedom but respect others and most important have common sense."
752303,blarg,2012-12-16 17:59:00,289," If we banned boats to ensure that no one was ever killed again by a reckless or drunk boater would that be worth it?  How about banning booze again?  Perhaps we should imprison people for speeding instead of giving out tickets, the if it saves just one life argument is no argument at all.  How many of us grew up in homes with rifles and ammunition on the wall and didn't shoot anyone, of those of us who grew up in the country at least, lots i bet.  I wish there was an answer, without a constitutional amendment which i can't ever imagine happening, the gun laws will not be changed enough to prevent this from happening again.  Even in Canada where our laws are much stricter, it happens, even with the beloved by some gun registry, it happened, this is a societal problem, and there are no easy answers.  Do you want a society without risk that someone might decide to hurt you, which even without guns is impossible, or do you want to live and not just be alive?  I wonder if the people in China are asking these same questions after the mass stabbings they are having, and apparently its nothing new there, even here stabbings now kill more people than shootings, and injure far more.  You will not get rid of guns, here or there, it will happen again, it doesn't matter if its a shotgun, hunting rifle, or handgun, or knife, or a pipe bomb, that's reality.  A sad one it is, but there is no use in pretending otherwise.  The answer to your question is no."
752305,DoubleDigits,2012-12-16 18:09:00,140," The guy in China stabbed 22 children. There were no fatalities. Zero.  There are many good, responsible people who own hand guns and assault weapons for many different weapons. They keep and operate them safely, and would never think about using them to kill people... would it be a shame that these people would be deprived of their lifelong hobby, and even their own private property,  if such weapons were to become illegal? Yes, it would be...Just not nearly as much as a shame as whole classrooms of children being slaughtered. Living in society is about making choices and sacrifices for the greater good of everyone..."

Pick out any item you find in your house and ask yourself can you Kill, Maim or Destroy something/one with this item? While not a fun game it will illustrate that it is not the item that is at fault it is the mind that thought of that as an acceptable use for that item. I know that our mindset in the USA on guns differ from Canada we both will always feel our view is correct because it is the one we have been shown socially as acceptable. I have had guns in my life since I was born from shooting food for the table to target practicing and even defending our nation from others that want to deny me my Constitutional rights. I have my own thoughts about the Canadian health care system, drug policies and the ways of the government but those are not for me to decide it is how the Canadians have elected and voted to have there lives regulated. Down here with the same voting system if one American votes no and a thousand Canadians agree with that vote in the end it is still just one vote that counts. Discussing gun control on this thread is not going to cause the US to ban guns however it will detract from the original thread and will cause nothing but disagreements from pro gun and anti gun believers.

I do however think that, yes he could have went in that school with a knife or a bic pen for that matter, but it was the weapons ability that enabled him do as much damage as possible in a short period of time. If he had a shotgun or a single shot rifle the casualty numbers would have been way down  In the news today, they are reporting the shooter was at the school the day before and had a fight with 4 teachers.. He returned to kill those 4.. He got 3 of them the 4th was off sick..Not that it matters but this explains the ""why"""

Its an unfathomable tragedy , that , unfortunately couldn't have really been avoided either way. Whether the murderous psycho's weapon is efficient enough is not the issue. Bombs are illegal. People make them illegally, and do horrible things. I feel all the attention brought to this tragedy will unfortunately feed copycats."
752420,jedimaster,2012-12-16 23:49:00,3472,"Just to be clear an ar15 is a non military weapon. It is not used by any military force. It is a civilian adapted semi automatic rifle made to look like the military m16. The automatic assault rifle version doesn't share common firing components and an ar15 by design cant be converted to one. It does shoot nato rounds though but many other rifles also shoot that round. Those round are relatively tame and are in fact designed to wound and not kill.  A 30-06 semi auto like a a common remington hunting rifle or a semi auto shotgun. I really hate to see people put the blame on a rifle type that is less dangerous than a common hunting firearm.  I do think that there was a clear failure in the systems already put in place to prevent these things. Doors too easy to break into, a mentally unstable person that was supposed to be prohibited from purchasing firearms was allowed to purchase them etc... there are a lot of things to look but as many have said the reality is that this derranged person and any other motivated, funded and determined person will and can get there hands on firearms to commit such terrible acts. Even in australia where they banned all semi automatic rifles and shotguns as well as all handguns still allow handguns of 22 calibre if you belong to and shoot at a range. They bought them back from the public and destroyed them. There is also now a huge infestation of illegal trafficking of firearms in Australia. There is no easy solution to this issue. One of the things I keep hearing is having all of the princicpals keep a locked up gun so they have some ability to try and defend themselves and the students. Now this may seem extreme, but it has been proven that people don't commit mass shootings in places where they know people have weapons to defend themselves.  Perhaps they need to have rotating undercover cops patrol schools so that everyone knows its possible an armed cop is in the school. That might make people think twice."

Its a generality yes but I actually think it would actually make people think twice and if not then at least someone would have a fighting chance to defend themselves and the kids. Teachers were throwing themselves in front of bullets. Kids were shot through there hands trying to hide from the bullets.  I mean lets be realistic, the americans aren't going to go the route of banning all guns, or even hand guns, or even semi auto's.

We are going to see the killers face fill our TV and computer screens for the next several days at least. We are going to see the weapons used along with a full description of how they work over and over again. The media will show us the killers FB page , his Youtube channel, any chat groups or forums he participated in, and they will pursue everyone that ever knew him at school or work or in his neighbourhood and private life. Some will co-operate in order to get there 15 minutes of fame. We will see pictures of the faces of grieving and shocked parents. We will see the look of fear and confusion on the faces of the children. The media will produce a computer generated animation of the school showing where the killer parked his car , where he entered the school and where he shot his first victim right up to where he killed himself. Any videos of the killer participating in any activity will be shown. We will see this stuff over and over again during the next several days.

Pistols are nothing more than tools that have both work related and recreational uses. I am not a gun nut but do own both long barrel and pistols and to date my pistols and rifles have not done any thing illegal. Canada has chosen to limit the ownership of  pistols I am sad for this ruling it deprives you of a freedom that you do not have the pleasure of pursuing. Shall we also take away your right to drive a car or have diesel and fertilizer banned too? One has kill thousands of people a year the other can be misused and do a huge amount of damage or power a car and grow plants.

The conflation of guns and freedom, and the idea that citizens need to defend themselves from tyranny are falsehoods, sold, lock, stock and barrel by the people who make billions from producing WEAPONS (not tools...a hunting rifle is a tool, and to a soldier an AR is a tool, but we are talking about weapons--intended for killing human beings)."

I use pistols just as some people find riding a snow mobile enjoyable. Both can kill the user or both can kill others it is all about how it is guided. I have served in the special forces and have fired weapons from a slingshot up to a 50 cal. sniper rifle that can literally shoot a fly off your shoulder at 500 yards. I do not own pistols for hunting nor will I use it for protection (a shotgun is much better) they are a recreational outlet for many people I know.

Smuggled guns can't be controlled as they are by definition smuggled against the law, but those weapons are owned and used by criminals, who are more likely to use them among one another (among criminals).  This maniac's parents don't sound like criminals, and guess what, if they lived in a country where guns weren't a symbol of freedom to certain people, 20+ innocent children and teachers would still be alive. He would not have gone after them with a hammer. He would not have attempted to run over them. Don't be so damn foolish.  There is a high degree of cowardice in these types of acts. It's very cowardly, you just need to push a button, and you can wreak havoc. Swinging a hammer or driving a car is not as simple.

A next door camper keeps a loaded gun under the seat of his truck. Another neighbor buddy at the track was showing me his collection, and when I picked one up to have a closer look, he said ""Careful now, It's loaded"". I just don't get that. He had probably a half dozen guns in his colletion alone.  Nancy Lanza owned these guns. Why does an upper middle class woman need to own these things? None of my friends Moms owned pistols and assault weapons. Anyways, I can go on and on about this. Raising my 5 years old grandson might have something to do with my feelings about this.  Bottom line for me is that ""the right to bear arms"" should be revisited. Clearly not everyone should have that ""right"".

751912,hotsky,2012-12-15 00:54:00,400,Pretty shocking and upsetting news.... Why??? 
751913,Gerritt,2012-12-15 00:56:00,6129,Lack of parenting.
751914,misfish,2012-12-15 00:58:00,29133," X2 Dave  When we were growing up,it was donkey Kong and Mario brothers. Now it,s,KILL,KILL KILL.WAR. And it,s live stream."
751915,Slop,2012-12-15 00:58:00,151,Words could'nt possibly describe what the parents of these children must be going through right now.  Needless loss of life....
751916,HTHM,2012-12-15 00:59:00,4082,"This evil has been here much longer than you realize, just better publicity now:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bath_School_disaster - in 1927"
751918,muskymatt,2012-12-15 01:02:00,2608," You can't be sure of that, the suspects mom was a kindergarden teacher. Maybe this guys wiring was crossed or shorted out. How can you justify actions like that other than to having to consider the guys brain was not working right.  Some folks just aren't right in the head.  You have to feel for the family of the victims and the suspect."
751921,Bassaholic,2012-12-15 01:10:00,74," Evil is evil...men like this have been around doing things like this long before video games. This puke obviously had a SICK mind, did violent video games help...probably not...but there's no doubt he would have found ""inspiration"" somewhere and still done something like this regardless.  Prayers go out to the parents."
751922,chessy,2012-12-15 01:11:00,610, yes the mother was the owner of all guns.... but what i want to know and never thought about it till now.is why is there no door in every class room that leads to the outside those kids are stuck in the room no exit unless they can get by the intruder. going to call the school board and ask why . even motels hotels hospitals have other ways out .. but not a school.
751925,Moosebunk,2012-12-15 01:26:00,3970,While cooking supper tonight my 13 year old was glued to the news on TV.  Made for interesting dinner conversation that's for sure.  Extra big hugs to the kiddies at bedtime tonight.  This slaughter of children is heinous.  There should be a Hell in Hell for him.  A person would have to be either possessed or simply not human.
751929,misfish,2012-12-15 01:36:00,29133," As always,,WELL SAID.  :angel:"
751930,Stoty,2012-12-15 01:41:00,2910," I dont think that has much to do with anything. A SICK person is a SICK person...doesnt matter what TV they watch or games they play. I just wish this ""hero"" would have had the balls to stick around and not take the easy way out like the COWARD he is. makes me sick."
751934,Freshtrax,2012-12-15 02:15:00,2215,They should have resuscitated him and killed him over and over again until he had paid for the lives he took.   Sorry but this makes me sick.
751938,GBW,2012-12-15 02:53:00,8460,"That's a hell of a good point!  While at work today all I could think of was my kids, 9 and 6 when I found out this was going on.  I almost feel they need to watch a movie like red dawn to get out of class if something were to ever go wrong.  Now THATS just WRONG that I need to even consider that.  To those that have lost and those who happen to be there and the ones involved.  I am sorry for you and your loss..."
751946,Dave Bailey,2012-12-15 03:41:00,1641," 'Possession' is not an explanation, there is no such thing. And he was human. The latest info is that he was autistic, therefore not fully capable of judging his own actions. There is no evil here, just a mentally ill person who was just as much a victim as anyone else. Nobody asks to be mentally ill."
751949,jedimaster,2012-12-15 04:03:00,3472,All classrooms have a lock on the doors it won't be long before they are all locked from the inside during classes.

751978,Rich,2012-12-15 11:16:00,3927,"He was AUTISTIC, not mentally challenged, ever see rain man? He could do a whole lot of stuff normal people can do, but wqs incapable of making normal decisions, hence he had a caretaker. Just because someone can tie their shoes doesn't mean they know what to do with them. They were his mother's weapons. Loading, reloading, and using the weapons could have been learned by simply watching his mother at the range.  Very tragic. They said things would have been worse, had these kindergarten kids not already been trained for this situation.  .......  So why are they training kindergarteners for class shootinga as part of the curriculum now?"
752013,jedimaster,2012-12-15 15:17:00,3472,"Apparently he was not buzzed into the school by the principle as was previously reported, the report from the sheriff is that he forced his way into the school.  You can't possible protect everyone and prevent bad things from happening. How far is too far? Armed officer's at every school? What about banning all guns? What about arming the teachers? What about closing down all the schools and do E-learning for everyone.  Legislation can't prevent people from going off the cliff and killing people. What is the fine line of enough prevention and enough protection but not so much that its out of control. Is there such a thing as too much or too far when protection is the goal?  Everyone is going to be clamoring for answers over the next little while but the cold hard fact is the guy flipped his lid and fortunately he is now dead.  So sad, so tragic."
752015,woodenboater,2012-12-15 15:31:00,2277,"I couldn't find anything definitive about Autism or Aspergers and this killer. I've met a fair number of people with autism and could never imagine they would be prone to this type of action so I'd like to place this on other mental health issues for now. Hearsay from fellow students is not precise information.  Either way, I hope the parents of the dead children will be given all the support they need to deal with this tragedy."
752021,Dave Bailey,2012-12-15 16:13:00,1641," Autism is now viewed as a very broad spectrum disorder, with many different levels, almost as individual as the numbers of people with it. And many other mental health issues are now being re-classified as on the autism spectrum, that's why there has been an apparent rise in the number of cases, when in reality there are no more diagnoses of mental illness in children than before."
752034,mr blizzard,2012-12-15 16:50:00,1589,"As some of u know we lost our daughter almost 9 years ago of natural causes.  With the emotions and feelings that one has to go through in a situation like that I can only partially comprehend what those parents must be going through when those innocent lives were taken so tragically, regardless of the time of year but especially before Christmas.  Instead of spending billions of dollars to see if life exists  in outerspace or has done so maybe just maybe that money could be invested back on earth for  a period of time so the heads of our countries could take care of some of the real needs and issues we are facing on a day to day basis on planet earth. All u seam to hear is ""we are cutting back"" in the government circles but they can throw money in the air.  Regardless of your beliefs or religion I would challenge each one of the members on the board to give a thought or a prayer for all that were affected by this tragidy. I know first hand it helps to heal."
752036,tb4me,2012-12-15 16:55:00,3295,"The man in question (I wont say his name) was high functioning Autism. He was also an honour student, However he also had a personality disorder.. Lets not confuse Autism into being involved in this. This is directly from the shooters brother. Its time for Americans to reconsider the gun laws..I can almost guarantee you that if he were carrying rifles or shot guns he would have never made it in the school, and if he had he most certainly wouldn't have been able to fire over 100 rounds in as short of a time he did. I understand the guns were legally owned by the the shooters mother but I seriously doubt they were locked up in a box with trigger locks on them. I just don't understand why hand guns are needed unless you in law enforcement or military..There is just no need for them at all. So many things could have been done to prevent this, lets just hope we learn from this and move forward.. Did anyone hear about  Mary Ann Jacob,  the library clerk at Sandy Hook?.She  Protected many children...saved their lives. God bless her."
752037,Rich,2012-12-15 17:00:00,3927,Was anybody commenting here ACTUALLY involved? Otherwise its all just heresay facts from different news stations and bias misquotes.
752042,tb4me,2012-12-15 17:25:00,3295,"No offence Rich but were humans, we talk to cope with what just happened. Communication is key to dealing with this no matter how effected one may have been.. Anyone with kids has had one heck of a hard time coping with all of this. Monday take the time to hug or thank your childrens teachers for a amazing job well done. Interestingly enough our daughter just had a lock down drill this week, it went down exactally as the teachers described .."

751875,tb4me,2012-12-14 21:58:00,3295,im shocked..The shooters mom was the kindergarden teacher of the class he went into..Then a NRA rep had the nerve to tweet this nonsence  @NRA_Spokesman: thoughts and prayers go out to the gun owners whose rights may be threatened because of today's shooting.  Im sure gun control is going to rear its ugly head now.....
