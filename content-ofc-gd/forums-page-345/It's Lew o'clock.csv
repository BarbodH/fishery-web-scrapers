752225,Grimace,2012-12-16 15:14:00,2020,I am in Timmins right now and it is snowing pretty good (again).  We are looking at a few more days of it.  It has been -10 to -15 for the last few days and below -20 overnight.  People are skating on the ponds and snowmobiles are buzzing around. It is -8 right now.
752233,fishindevil,2012-12-16 15:40:00,6254,Sounds like a blast grimace I wish I was there right now on my snowmobile !!!!! Awesome wish it was -15 here too
752236,Handlebarz,2012-12-16 15:46:00,3790,Yesterday we had the small sweat bees flying around then just today I found a huge slug on the front door. I sure am getting used to these winters.
752262,Grimace,2012-12-16 16:22:00,2020, They are ice fishing on the back lakes. I wish I had the time but I am too busy working. There are endless back trails and endless lakes. It truly is an outdoorsman's paradise. Every 1200 metres or so off of highway 101 or 655 there is another trail going into the bush.  When I come back up after Christmas I am going to bring my sled at least.  I won't have any time for ice fishing but I might be able to sneak in the odd blast on the sled.  A view from my hotel room.
