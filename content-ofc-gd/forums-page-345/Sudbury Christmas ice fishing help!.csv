My fianc√© is from sudbury, specifically Val Caron and we will be spending the holidays with her mother and brother. Everyone likes fishing so I threw out the idea of getting out on the ice over the holidays assuming there is some safe ice. Everyone is in assuming i have warm hut! I would like to get out for splake as I haven't fished them before. But really anything would do, walleye, pike, lakers, whiteys, ect. Basically I'm looking for a small lake within an hours drive of Val Caron with in walking distance from wherever we can park. If you could pm me any info/suggestions that would be great. Any help would be much appreciated. Thanks in advance."
752471,walleyejigger,2012-12-17 01:45:00,876,"loon, moon, george alaska or jonhsons, all just off the highway within walking distance of each other just north of cartier, specks, rainbows and if ur lucky a brown, but make sure that one is hush hush"
752840,Ryan Landry,2012-12-18 03:58:00,128,Thanks for the info! are these trout stocked or wild? I gps'd the lakes and cant tell if they're fed by a river system or not. any suggestions on lures/bait.
752843,BillM,2012-12-18 04:11:00,17367, They'd be stocked.
752866,Fishnwire,2012-12-18 10:53:00,983,I wouldn't count on there being enough ice.  There's not enough now and the forecast doesn't have a lot of cold weather coming between now and X-mas.  I hope I'm wrong.
752881,Ryan Landry,2012-12-18 12:42:00,128,"I hope so to! but i guess it is what is is. If it doesn't work out next week, i'll be back a couple weeks later. Thanks for the update"
753089,walleyejigger,2012-12-19 00:50:00,876,"stocked lakes, ice will be iffy on those lakes with the mild temperatures, a few huts out on local lakes right now but I'd say they're a little nuts, i've fallen thru moon on new years day one year but was driving my truck on a bigger local lake the day before, be prudent and check the ice  i have friends who've been fishing the watershed/gogama/timmins area for about 3 weeks now"
