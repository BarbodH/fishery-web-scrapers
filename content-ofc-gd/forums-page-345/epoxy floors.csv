752923,bare foot wader,2012-12-18 16:04:00,1354,"where is the warehouse located?  I did epoxy flooring for 3 years through college in Peterborough...my boss had only 1 main competitor, Stonhard based out of Whitby I think....we did a ton of small factories in the St. Catherines to GTA to Ottawa area...GM was the number 1 customer, ford and honda, a lot of food processors, high tech labs, etc  assuming this is a straight rolled on epoxy, no mortar underneath...the blasting machine is connected to a huge vacuum, 1 man operates the blaster and 2 guys follow around with the vacuum...shoot the pellets at the floor, vacuum sucks up pellets and epoxy debris, magnet separates steel pellets from debris(to be reused), epoxy debris continues to vacuum....followed by a thorough sweeping  I'll PM you contact details for my old boss  10k square feet  isn't too big, if you're only removing the epoxy it shouldn't be too bad for pricing, but is expensive to install"
