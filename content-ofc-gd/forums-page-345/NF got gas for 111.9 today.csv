752513,Jer,2012-12-17 11:02:00,1426,"  I don't know how that Shell station stays in business...it is ALWAYS 4 or 5 cents higher than the Ultramar. Just yesterday the Ultramar was at 110.9, Shell was 114.9."
751706,jedimaster,2012-12-14 01:28:00,3472,So I filled up at 111.9 today... then got back to toronto and its  119... what the hell is going on here.Why is gas so cheap compared in peterborough compare to toronto?
751709,kickingfrog,2012-12-14 01:34:00,8333,"Well, if I remember correctly excuse number 37 for price gouging from the oil companies is: Competition between stations causes the price to go up. Seriously."
751711,fishindevil,2012-12-14 01:36:00,6254,Don't know but it's always a lot cheaper in Peterbourough been that way for a few years !!! I got gas in Lindsay yesterday for 113. Not too bad !!!!
751712,kickingfrog,2012-12-14 01:40:00,8333,Buck 15.4 here in Barrie. I paid a dollar 10.4/litre with a 2 car wash purchase.
751715,danc,2012-12-14 01:49:00,4677,"I think its about a buck 29 here but I get mine on the rez for about 20 cents cheaper, so I don't pay attention to it so much."
751721,irishfield,2012-12-14 02:23:00,26272,"Been 10 cents a litre cheaper, at minimum, in Midland (compared to GTA) ever since CTC put in their new gas bar and started a price war with Zehrs across the road. We use to be the other way around.. with the excuse that we were ""at the end of a dead end highway, so it cost more to deliver"".  Currently 112.7.. what a deal eh??!!"
751722,Luke V.,2012-12-14 02:29:00,286,My best friend just flew in from Edmonton. He filled up for 99.8 on the way to the airport. Here in niagara your look at 1.20-1.26 today.
751724,brkygetr,2012-12-14 02:48:00,425,One o 9.3 in Port Elgin....by far the cheapest I have seen in a long while.
751732,funfishing,2012-12-14 04:03:00,147,"ontariogasprices.com is a handy site if you know you'll be travelling. If I can save $5 each time I fill up and I fill up 2.5 times per week or more, that's $500+/year in savings. Not too shabby."
751756,Billy Bob,2012-12-14 12:41:00,5865,Here in WNY $3.73 per US gallon...but my son is paying $2.85 in Virginia...
751772,Ralph Field,2012-12-14 14:05:00,1018,Cheap gas can be purchased on any native reserve. My brother in law pays 1.06/L.
751774,bigmac1984,2012-12-14 14:11:00,193,"I wish these prices would stick around into next summer when it comes time to fill the boat, but we all know that won't happen, it will be up in the $1.30/Litre range again, if not higher. Lets all enjoy it while we can!"
751835,mike rousseau,2012-12-14 19:49:00,4661,0.97per liter....  Love the Rez....

751879,funfishing,2012-12-14 22:40:00,147, That's a crazy price! Where? Lowest I get at native reserves is usually 106 these days.
752035,largemouthtrout,2012-12-15 16:52:00,53,"I forget exactly which Quatrain it was from , but I,m pretty sure Nostrodaemus predicted that the price of crude oil will increase 20 percent and gas will cost 20 cents more on Thursday December 20th at around 2:45 pm. On the 24th it will cost 28 cents more , and then it will drop on January 5th by 10 cents ."
752050,Lunatic,2012-12-15 18:20:00,536,"I drive for a living,and my work is all over ontario.what ive noticed was kingston on average has the cheapest gas in ontario. in the same day i started out in beamsville,gas was 1.18, i drove up to kingston which was 1.12,then to ottawa which was 1.16. the next day gas in beamsville was 1.17,i got to windsor and it was 1.15,back to london it was 1.13.  ive seen it as low as 1.10 and that was in kingston this week. but drive an hour in any direction and it goes up."
752091,funfishing,2012-12-15 21:31:00,147,"I don't find Kingston to ever be the cheapest, that's strange. Peterborough and London are both cheaper. Kingston seems average or a little below. Shannonville is cheap, $1.06 lately. I'm calling baloney on 97.5 though unless he can say where!"
752104,skidoosafari,2012-12-15 22:23:00,46,130 L @ .90 CENTS = CHEAP GAS . TODAY JUST OUT SIDE BRANTFORD

752158,Lunatic,2012-12-16 03:31:00,536,"thats what ive been seeing,kingston being cheapest.i cut thru shannonville to go to belleville and thats all rez so i dont include that. even toronto has dipped down to 113 (i believe) in the past 2 weeks. but here in the hammer its been at the 1.17-1.20 range. theres no excuse for these differences. they do it because they can."
752168,mike rousseau,2012-12-16 04:41:00,4661,  You got me...  I like posting bogus gas prices to stir the pot here.... I love making others jealous with lies... Lmao!!!!!   Akwesasne  $3.67 per gallon.... 3.78 liters per gallon.... So $0.97 per liter....
752203,jjcanoe,2012-12-16 14:12:00,744,".98.6 yesterday on the Delaware 1st nation reserve west of London @ GD's  It was as low as 1.09 in London earlier in the week  so that means it would have been around 5cents cheaper in St Thomas, they are always less money, except for the 2 stations on Wellington rd south."
