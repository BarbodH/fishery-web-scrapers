We want to do a ice trip somewhere during the holidays. SOmething like the 27th - 30th  Where would be our best bet for some fish and ICE ?????? Looking for a rental hut .... but I can bring my own, if need be."
752918,Raf,2012-12-18 15:40:00,3495,"not sure there'll be much in the way of safe ice south of the french river, the exception being maybe some lakes in haliburton.  you'll have a drive ahead of you for sure with the forecasted temps."

752985,bobowski,2012-12-18 19:56:00,360,I heard that Little Lake in Barrie is completely covered as of this morning. The ice is only about an inch thick though. Totally unsafe right now but if it holds it might be good by christmas. Please dont take any chances on the ice unless you know for sure.
752989,ecmilley,2012-12-18 20:14:00,2163,"the part of sturgeon lake  i live on as froze over and reopened 3 times since dec 6, wide open right now and don't expect any ice making staying around zero with 25-35 k winds by the weekend, may get the canoe out again"
