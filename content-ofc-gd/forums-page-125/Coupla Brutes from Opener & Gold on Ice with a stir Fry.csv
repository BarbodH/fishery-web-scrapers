971747,Leecher,2016-05-29 22:36:00,7832,"Yes please! I just happen to have fresh walleye right now too.  Hook me up!  Miigwech  Ok Rick here goes.... First cut your veggies in bite chunks (veggies you like & the more the better) and your walleye filets.  Fine chop garlic, ginger and scallions.  In a hot wok, add extra virgin olive oil to cover 2/3 of the bottom, a dab of butter, add your garlic and ginger.... let sizzle for few seconds.  Add the chunks of walleye, make sure they are laying flat on the long side.  Flip the chunks and let them sizzle for the same amount of time.  When you see the chunks almost cook thru, add your veggies, soya, worcestershire and balsamic vinaigre (caution on balsamic, just a few drizzle).  toss all the ingredients and cover for a minute..... uncover and toss some more....  add bean sprouts and water chestnuts to the mix.   When the beans are looking semi cooked, sprinkle the scallions over and it's time to serve and enjoy  Great walleye opener! Glad to hear from you again  By the way, the tip ups you made me still work perfectly  Thanks Chad!!!  Glad to see them tipups doing it's job"
