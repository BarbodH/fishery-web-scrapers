So your saying in my eyes that all fish hooked either too big, too small for the slot or in theslot died.  That's how tough the fishing was out there that I bet based on talking to two buddies to fished it the total fish ""stung"" was still under 300.  You can BET that some of the ""floaters"" came from various reasons including pre-fishing. When I catch a walleye over the slot and I feel I want photo prof (bragging rights not tourny stuff) I don't even take it out of the net. I have fished in EC's boat many a time and yes it is older but we have never had a walleye be belly up or even close to it when we fish this very lake.  Trust me when I say waves make no issues in the livewell as EC likes to get spot to spot FAST and we've had some ""fun rip's"" and it's never been an issue on this lake water temp or livewell wise. If there was dead fish as a 100% proven direct result to that event; I fell it was the angler and a bad catch and release (livewell or stringer) system that failed for the majority of any dead fish.

972178,landry,2016-06-03 03:26:00,1005,I'm not sure why everyone is ripping on this Dave guy. I don't know him but he obviously cares about the fishery. He is on our side not against us. We all care about the Kawarthas. He's trying to help the lake. I can tell you one thing for sure - this tournament is not helping Sturgeon Lake and it's likely more damaging than others.  I have met Cliff once. He is an honest kind person. His report of dead fish only supports Daves case.  On a side note- Why anyone would want to go in a tournament with a slot limit is beyond me. I laugh at those Redfish tournies down south.  We all bring bias into this argument. I personally do not care for tournaments. I could elaborate on the why but it's just my BIAS. A few others here come into this fight with an affinity for them and they will see what they want to see just like I did.
972182,Garnet,2016-06-03 09:33:00,2056,I practiced 2 days the week of the tournament and 2 days the week before and seen dead fish in all areas of the lake. There was alarming amount filleted.  Because of the tournament we own all these fish including the ones filleted.

The MNR makes decisions based on science/biology from what I have always been told when involved in various local fishery groups. We can argue all we want on this site, but the MNR will make the final decision on whether the tourney can continue if the Chamber moves forward again next year."

971992,grimsbylander,2016-06-01 13:01:00,3016,"That be said, do those conditions not apply to dozens or 100's of lakes nation wide? Would it not make more sense to modify the tournament as opposed to pushing for possible termination and opening the doors to further restrictions to other areas of our sport? In other tournaments I've seen: A lower catch limit? Shorter hours? Biggest fish per hour, so boats would only have one, maybe two fish in the boat at any one time and they'd get weighed in within two hours? There are a multitude of existing rules that are active in other tournaments that could be implemented to lower the risk and number of fish that die (without being consumed). It's my view that this needs to be looked at with an unbiased opinion, mine included, and without the ""not on my lake"" attitude. As said before, better control is the key. Eliminating live release tournaments will lead to higher kill rates."

IMHO all the Kawartha lakes are small and fragile with regards to the impact us fishermen can have on them...and I'm sure that is his point. I'm also sure all Kawartha Lakes close to scugog will get additional pressure now that walleye is closed on it.  And any reasonable person would realize that having an open ice season albeit only for panfish,will also have an impact on walleye. I'm sure lotsa dishonest or uneducated people take them home if they catch some and I'm also sure some die after handling even if released.  I don't know Dave/Fenelon at all.

971806,grimsbylander,2016-05-30 15:50:00,3016,"I think it's sad only if the 27 dead walleye were wasted. Remember, tournament fish limits are at or below the legal limits for ONE fisherman, not two. I think that in extenuating circumstances, such as the heat on this past weekend, rule concessions should be made to make sure any fish that dying fish and are kept for eating. Sounds counterproductive but there were 140 anglers in that tournament and apparently 27 dead fish...that's under .2 fish per angler. Those guys aren't going to quit walleye fishing if the tournament ceases to exist."
971808,jimmer,2016-05-30 15:58:00,2730,"That's 27 that we know of and not all of the 140 boats would be fishing one lake.  There just needs to be more care with the optics in the community; the last thing outdoors people need is to be scrutinized about killing and wasting fish. Yes, this tournament has been around a long time, but I never remember this many fish dying in the old days. I did enjoy a relatively quiet weekend on the water with everyone on Sturgeon."
971809,AKRISONER,2016-05-30 16:02:00,5558,call me crazy but I swear ive watched an episode of uncut angling where the walleye tournament required them to not livewell the fish. they basically ran back to the weighing station and locked in catches as they got them. you outright had to make your decision to keep the fish and have it weighed an measured right then and there as you caught it.  There are other formats that could be used for this tournament IMO.  But hearing about this garbage is upsetting. Shut it down.
971810,manitoubass2,2016-05-30 16:02:00,11391,Just a quick question  What are the water temps like and depth of the lake?  I dont think ive ever had a walleye die in the live well from heat(just run your live well often)  Wicked dumb that they dont eat the walleye. Frig donate them or something.  Id love to see the MNR fine tourney anglers for this
971811,FrankTheRabbit,2016-05-30 16:05:00,479," But I agree. If fish are kept like that for tourneys with those kinds of heat, fish should be put in a fish fry instead of floating down the river belly up."
971812,manitoubass2,2016-05-30 16:05:00,11391,Ive discussed this many times with local tourney anglers.  A time stamped photo with length is the way to go.  But NO!!! Everybody in the tent needs to see the big fish and hear WEIGHTS.
971813,dave524,2016-05-30 16:12:00,4508,"27 were essentially dead upon release, I'd expect the real toll will never be known as many will swim away to succumb later."
971815,grimsbylander,2016-05-30 16:15:00,3016,"When you say 0.2 doesn't sound like a lot, it should be interpreted as 20% or 1 in 5 walleye. 20% of known fish died and that sure sounds whole lot different than just 0.2.  But I agree. If fish are kept like that for tourneys with those kinds of heat, fish should be put in a fish fry instead of floating down the river belly up.  May sound different but it's exactly the same. Frame it as you like. It's my opinion that the only issue is the fish that get wasted."
971819,crappieperchhunter,2016-05-30 17:12:00,2582,My biggest problem is the waste as well.  140 anglers targeting walleye with only 27 dead isn't going to hurt the fishery. Even if the mortality is double because of die off after release..54 fish isn't going to damage the fishery. Hell I'd be willing to bet that those same anglers fishing on the same weekend but not in a tournament....would probably have taken that many or more home for there own meals.  Just have a solid plan in place to deal with the issue when it arises like it did again this past weekend.  Seeing floaters upsets everyone. Fishermen and none fishermen alike.

The 20% kill rate in that tourney is 80% better than the one on the first page of the General Discussions right now. I just don't want to see fish get wasted unnecessarily.
971828,jimmer,2016-05-30 18:00:00,2730,Let's just make it a derby then and keep everything if it won't have that much of an impact on the fishery.

971838,Garnet,2016-05-30 19:35:00,2056,"The fish are not wasted. They will be possessed this week and donated to the local food bank.  This time the board has good info. They know every fish that was deemed stressed and all dead fish up to the weight in, and what boats weight them. It's 2 different penalty's.  If more died in the liverelease boats that needs to be looked at.  The heat is not likely the issue. ""if"" you caught your fish in Goose Bay in 75 degree water and then went out to the lake in 70 degree water you wouldn't have know issues.  You would definitely have a problem if you took those fish back into Goose Bay.  I learn this from fishing Sturgeon for 40 years. Now it would be great if Dr Bruce Tuff did a study on this and made it common knowledge and gave us some parameters to follow."
971841,jimmer,2016-05-30 19:59:00,2730,"What about moving it to opening weekend? That way there shouldn't be the same problem with water temps.  I was being sarcastic about the catch and kill derby, sorry.  This tournament has always been good for the area, but not at the expense of fish dying.  There has to be a way to correct the issues."
971847,Garnet,2016-05-30 20:51:00,2056,It's weather. Might be 20 years before it repeats.  Hopefully they can get a cause and a solution.
971862,landry,2016-05-30 22:17:00,1005,I agree. From what I heard the fish were scooped up if possible and not wasted. But I also agree that it is poor optics. I am not a fan of tournaments anyways.
971889,jimmer,2016-05-31 13:07:00,2730,"It's weather. Might be 20 years before it repeats.  Hopefully they can get a cause and a solution. They need to figure it out, it happened a couple of years ago. Not that we can figure out weather, but figure out what's best for the fishery."

Anything above 12 degrees C and you're going to get mortality, regardless of all the other stressors that the fish are exposed to. Add to this the potential for 8 hours in a livewell that is anoxic and overcrowded (less than 13.5 liters per fish and you get substantial mortality), fish potentially getting bounced around if the surface conditions are rough, multiple thermal shocks throughout the entire day (anything more than a 2degreeC variance and you get substantial mortality), handling stress when being netted from live well, measured and handled by the judge (stressed again) , improperly held up to show the crowd, thermally shocked again, held in a crowded ""release tank"", then thermally shocked again when they are ""released"". All this equates to a repeat performance of the 2012 and 2015 disasters. The fishery deserves better than this !  Dave"

I throw back a lot of fish, but when I'm looking for a fish fry, which i do often enough, the only time I ever have pickerel right side up in my livewell is if I'm fishing early April on the Detroit.  Otherwise, they roll and die in short order, or do the sideways lethargic gill flap we are all familiar with, they aren't recovering from that either.  Bass are a much hardier fish.  That's a fact, and all the disputing in the world from would be tourny fishermen won't change it.  Make it a derby and kill em all, at least you won't be trying to fool anyone."

Glad you're not just some troll who just signed up just because you had an agenda. Listen carefully...fisherman are allowed to KILL their legal limit of fish. Two fisherman in a boat can both KILL their legal limits of fish. Fisherman not fishing a tournament are still going to fish and KILL their limit of fish if they so desire. Fisherman fishing a tournament try NOT to KILL a single fish. Now, if you were a fish, would you rather be caught in a tournament or the weekend after???"
971973,fishindevil,2016-06-01 08:59:00,6254,The MNR probly now has all the proper documentation they need to shut this down for good !!! As well as the residents who live there .... There is a lot more than most of you think there is also members who sit on the lake steward committee as well as the MNR people and a biologist regardless the temps were too warm there were problems again as usual and that's why the hours and the change of fish limit was brought in at end of day on Saturday ..... Hopefully the gong show will end we will see as the ball is rolling

Terry's comment was right on. Make it a derby, kill all the fish and the short-sighted locals will be happy. Ridiculous."
706230,danc,2012-06-16 00:15:00,4677,"I personally stay as far away from tournaments as possible. My idea of going fishing includes getting away from people and crowds. The closest that I was to a tournament situation was a couple of years ago in Red Lake during the big annual Walleye derby. I was living on the lake just a stones throw away from the public dock, which was the tourney HQ. The number of big dead Walleye that I saw floating past my dock during and after weigh in was alarming, to say the least. I don't know if this was a unique situation or not, but it is the only one that I experienced personally. Bottom line for me is that I've never been a fan of competitive fishing. I'll go and play horseshoes if I'm in a competitive mood."
706233,Roy,2012-06-16 00:23:00,13728,I hear you Cliff. You can speak your peace all you want as long as there is no flaming.
706252,Dutch,2012-06-16 02:02:00,831," Hey BC - need more info before jumping to conclusions.  Fish may not have been wasted and we don't know for sure if that photo was from the actual release boat - I have no reason to believe that it is not, but just making the point.  Garfisher - lots of my buddy this, my buddy that.  Were you actually at the event to see any of this with your own peepers?  Fanning the fire a bit on this one, I think.  Also throwing around some figures trying to flame a bit more - 25% mortality in this tourney would be a large number, the fish in those bags don't represent even close to that.  MNR investigation - not that I know of.  I called MNR offices today to see if anyone knew of it, to get some actual facts nobody heard anything about it.  Threads like this fuel issues that we as receational fishermen don't want to have to deal with.  There are those organizations out there, those that shall not be named, that look for this stuff to further their agenda.  It is unfortunate that any fish died at all, but it is unavoidable, and off-putting.  But, the sensationalising of issues that may not even be factual just goes to damage and sully the reputation of all tournament and recreational anglers in the eyes of the public."
706257,danc,2012-06-16 02:22:00,4677,"  The situation in my post was indeed fact. I lived at this property for an entire spring, summer, and fall and spent every evening on the dock. Not once did I ever see a dead Walleye except during the tournament, when I saw a dozen or so float by. If this is damaging to tournament fishermen (not rec fishermen), so be it. I can only tell you what I saw with my own two eyes."
706282,Dutch,2012-06-16 07:31:00,831," Sorry Dan, wasn't referring to your post, more of the second hand information garfish is throwing around about this specific tourney."
706306,Garnet,2012-06-16 12:09:00,2056,Big Cliff I like you very interesting cat. 12 years is great.  I have family in very 1 of these community's born and raised there. These are the people that are members of the Chamber sit on every focus group on the board for everything.  These are small tight knit community's I just hope it all works out for you. Good Luck Buddy.
706314,hirk,2012-06-16 12:52:00,571,"With all due respect and your right to form an opinion Cliff, as Joe Friday on Dragnet used to say ""the facts,just the facts"". I don't see too many facts involving this event being floated around. You have painted all tournaments with a brush based on sensationalism thats been slung."
706325,bushart,2012-06-16 13:52:00,2628,Dan C----Red Lake walleye derby is hard on fish  I know and have known many that fished that one  By labour day the deeper bite seems on there and some of those eyes are not comin up from those depths very well
706346,Big Cliff,2012-06-16 17:47:00,6899," Well, the fact is that a friend of mine noticed several dead walleye floating around after the tournament and he knew nothing of the reports or pictures when he told me about it so there is something to support the pictures and reports. If those fish didn't go to waste, what did happen to them? Did someone clean them and take them home to eat? If they did wouldn't they be considered in posession and wouldn't they have been over their limit of 4 fish per day? Not only that, if they didn't catch them isn't that ""party fishing""? That being said, isn't it also against the law to spoil or allow to be spoiled any game or fish?  You are right Hirk, it is my opinion and until now I have never had any problem with tourniments, I often talk to anglers fishing my dock in the bass tourniments and I'm glad to see them enjoying their day. The problem is that walleye are a lot more sensitive than bass and if walley tourniments are going to result in fish kills like the one that seems to have happened here I will do whatever I can to prevent that from happening and that is a fact!"
706354,Garnet,2012-06-16 18:22:00,2056,"I will tell you something right now. Buddy over the other board his library card was revoked last Monday. He can't get a pass to the dog park. These people doing this community work, there family's have paid taxes for 200 years. They are everywhere. At your work down at the store they make your tax bill collect your garbage.  They like tourist better than somebody that payed taxes for 12 years.  Again I like you just friendly advice. And Good Luck"
706369,Sinker,2012-06-16 19:45:00,8692,"  Well I will tell you something right now. If those same people were born and raised up there, they would care more about the fishery, than they would a few bucks in thier pockets!! Whats going to draw their beloved tourists up there, when there are no fish left? Think about it.  This other guy you talk about has a lot more credibility than you, Garnet. How many years have you spent monitoring the lake?? He is also an avid fisherman, and hunter, so don't even go the tree hugger route.  Stick to your bass tourneys. The lake can't take the pressure on the walleyes, and they are much more sensitive than dirty old bass. Nobody wants to keep a bass for dinner anyways, so they all go back. Enough walleyes get eaten out of there in a season, let alone a tourney killing another seasons worth in one weekend!  If those pics aren't proof enough, I don't know what its going to take to get the point across.  Where did all those dead fish go? In the garbage? Maybe your council members filled thier freezers? Its pretty clear to me what went on up there.  Maybe contact your friends on council and ask them to read this post. Maybe they have some input on the matters? I'd bet my paycheck they don't say a word!!!  S."
706373,aplumma,2012-06-16 19:57:00,6896,I haven't fished a weight in tournament for Blue Catfish in 15 years. While the fish are hardy and every boat must have a 100 gal livewell with pump to participate or netbag I still see to much deadage the day after the tournament. I proposed a system that would be cheater free and uses random drawn cards and photos with tape measures to have a fair and fun tournament. The offer was declined because they would not attract a crowd at the weigh in  like someone hefting a 40-60 lb fish. I even went so far as to explain a projector screen with live photo updates from people in the field thru the day would be a way to get people excited to the sport and hopefully be future contestants. I am very happy to say though they do not have tournaments during the spawn or when the surface temperatures are above 80 F degrees. With this concession all of us that fish for the blue cat can have a chance to see the fisheries grow and support both the tournament and the recreational fisherman.   Art
706401,hirk,2012-06-16 21:47:00,571,"Cliff the fish would not be wasted and no one person would be given more than a legal limit, its also not party fishing as you can GIVE fish to someone. The MNR was present during the event to insure proper proceedures were followed. I read a post on OOD started by someone with the handle"" fenlon"" and the claims were clearly outlandish and it was painfully obvious that it was posted by someone that lives or has a cottage on the lake and suffers from major NIMBY (not in my backyard) regarding tournaments  and tried to fan the flames with a thinly vailed post."
706408,Garfisher,2012-06-16 22:01:00,229,"Well that ""NIMBY"" is also someone who probably has THE best knowledge of Sturgeon Lake's fish populations (he has all the info from past SSFC Fish Camps which sample Sturgeon in the fall).

I did not participant but as an observer I thought it had been better planned and run then any other tournament I have seen up there since we have had our cottage.  Then I read this thread today and read the news story. Wow....with the numbers posted and guesstimating as many more fish died after release....it would not be a stretch to say mortality could easily be 30% or higher.  All I gotta say is I hope the tournament boys go play on some one else's lake. This kinda stuff isn't welcomed by me on mine.
824996,fishindevil,2013-12-18 10:21:00,6254,It was disgusting lets just say that !!!! And now it was proven in court !!!! I'm still  mad as heck over it and it never should have happened there was anglers and people saying it was wrong from the get go and tried to voice their opinion !!! And as I stated before it so hot that day and the fish were so badly treated it was a gong show !!!!
971767,crappieperchhunter,2016-05-30 01:15:00,2582,Well lets kick a dead horse again here. This tournament was in Bobcaygeon again this weekend. Saturday at 6PM I wandered down to a place I shore fish for Bluegills near the Hiway#24 Bridge just before Caygeon. I fish this place all the time from May until October and have never seen a floater walleye. Saturday I walk down and find 3 as soon as I get to my fishing spot  and see several white bellies out on the water but can't confirm what species they where but I'm betting walleye.  Brutally hot Saturday. I'm betting the tournament had an unforgivably high walleye mortality rate again  Anybody heard anything?
971780,Sinker,2016-05-30 12:46:00,8692,"I heard they cut the tourny short because of heat and fish dying, but that is just a rumour.  S."

971801,crappieperchhunter,2016-05-30 14:57:00,2582,When I saw how warm it was Saturday I told Debbe they would have high mortality again. Then I went fishing and saw the floaters.  For the fishery it seems like the right thing to do is close it down. But it really is to bad because it  has been a well run tourney from the standpoint of how they have made such a great effort at the Beach Park Boat Launch. Our cottage is within walking distance of the launch and we have to drive by it if we are going into town for anything. They had one guy constantly guiding traffic on the road when the boats where coming out of the water Saturday...a far cry from some of the tournament traffic gong shows I have seen in our years there at the cottage.
971804,FrankTheRabbit,2016-05-30 15:39:00,479,"So, does the MNR step in to enforce the ""abandoning fish that is fit for consumption"" rule? Considering they have pics and recorded evidence, it should be a field day for them."
971805,jimmer,2016-05-30 15:49:00,2730,It just doesn't make sense to continue with a walleye tourney when there are warm weather issues. The last thing we need are walleye dying in live wells.
705739,johnnyb,2012-06-14 12:46:00,3413,"I have read one person's account which stated most of the walleye weren't even released back into the lake.  By the time the release boat got them out there, the majority had croaked.  "
705746,beagle dad,2012-06-14 12:56:00,224,heres an option hold a tournament where the anglers then get to take there fish home sure this would not be popular with anti tournament community  however would be perfectly legal no relaese!!! good bye to the future of our fisheries

Walleye were found dead that MAY (or not)have been as a result of a tournament and you are outraged and believe it has measurable impact on the fishery then you really wouldnt want to know how many are taken on a weekend by meat hunters,poached by keeping fish outside the slot or kept even though the fisherman already has a limit at home or kept via group fishing as well as mishandled or kept on a chain and later culled.To suggest a tournament has an impact in comparison to the above is......"
705785,beagle dad,2012-06-14 14:53:00,224,you can also add in there the kill rate when the TSW..raises and lowers lake levels..during winter and during or after spawning as evident a few yrs back on the kawarthas
705829,jedimaster,2012-06-14 16:47:00,3472,"If its a slot tournie, why not just turn in the single largest fish. Why bother turning in 5 slot fish? seems weird to me. I mean everyone and there dog knows that walleye are not like bass."
705831,beagle dad,2012-06-14 17:01:00,224,this tourney is not so much luck based catch 6 fish in slot to weigh in 2 days in a row only 16 out 100 teams weighed 6 fish 1st day..sure that was less over 2 days plenty boats caught 1 good upper slot limit fish the winners worked hard...practiced and deserved it
705887,Garnet,2012-06-14 19:29:00,2056,"The whitefish on Simcoe sucked so I'm home early.  MNR policy is 10% mortality, I don't think any tournament angler would be happy with that.  So I have no inside information just 30 years of high end tournament experience.  Let's start with parking, signed direction to the parking area for all rigs. People showing us were the next available spot. Anybody going to town Sat. or Sun. didn't even know we where their.  All this takes major planning. Congratulation to the board.  The check in and weight site was Little Bob Channel. This again was great planning on the boards behalf. Back in the day the weight in was at the park where 116 boats would have been floating around for  2 hrs blocking the channel. Bad for everybody.  Clearly marked channel was established for use to follow. So as each flight returned they went under the bridge and checked in.  The water temperature in Little Bob Channel and the main lake was exactly the same.  We all idled to a second pontoon boat that only let between 3-5 boats proceed to dock at any time. The check in boat, the second boat and the dock all had radio's.  Bags were only handed 1 at a time to control #'s a the wait troughs.  So we bagged our fish and walked maybe 100ft to a drain site. The bagged water and fish were dumped into a plastic box with 2 lids and immediately we were in the holding troughs.  These troughs were not large and the organizer where vigilante that not more than 3 people holding fish in 2 tanks. These tanks both had constant airination.  Seem like everybody was getting interview but at most maybe 2-3 minutes before I was on stage.  O ya I drain my basket 3 steps handed my fish to somebody and they were back in water for a quick check then on the scales.  At this point I was getting interview by 1 of my old tourney partners and good friend so I was getting the full treatment.  I was watching the scales and seen the weight lock in and before the print out started the fish were gone.  I think they were put in another basket with water and they were gone.  My good buddy was yacking I was yacking so I'm not real clear on were they went but my guess strait to the holding boat.  This all takes huge coordination. A great big Congrats to the board.  On day 2 we where second heat and checked in 8-10 minutes early and by the time we got to 2nd control boat we went strait to the dock. Total time maybe 15 minutes. I don't think I ever seen a better setup.  If and I mean if their was a problem the only thing I see that was missed or I missed.  Walleye are absolute oxygen hogs. With so many new to walleye competitors  maybe some education on livewell management would help.  You cannot pump enough water into your livewell I don't use my timers strait pump all day and then with my system I can pump them out at the same time always good to do.   You cannot blame the board if there was a problem if the fish get to them in bad shape bad things happen. It's the angler's fault.........that's why we get the penalty.  So nobody wants to guess how many walleye would be harvested if 100 were caught by Rec anglers last weekend. My guess 30 and all 100 probably could have been legally kept.   Legally 116*2 *4*2= 1856 so the tournament could have legally kept 1856 walleye last weekend. Now that's un acceptable."
705895,beagle dad,2012-06-14 19:58:00,224,very well put garnet
705901,Garfisher,2012-06-14 20:49:00,229,"From the one account I've heard suggesting something went foul, the release boat had iced water in it, so released walleye would have been shocked temperature wise twice (going in the boat and being released into the much warmer lake). The shock from warm to cold might have killed many fish, as it was reported by the same guy that there was a lot of fish that weren't released because they had been killed by the shock. I believe the MNR is investigating, it'll be a while yet before we get the ""official"" statement on what went on (so all we can do is really offer ideas/opinions about what might have happened until then).  It's probably considered fragile because the population is nowhere near the population it was before zebra mussels. After zebra mussels, the water cleared right up, which caused a lot of walleye to hunker down in the weedbeds, which made the fishing excellent for a while (Lots of fish in concentrated areas compared to lots of scattered fish when the water wasn't nearly as clear). Add in a ton of panfish and crappie, which thrive on clear waters and are voracious egg/fry/small fish feeders, and you quickly have a reduced reproductive success since adults do not care for the eggs after they are laid. Plus it's a relatively popular lake for fishing. Yes Sturgeon Lake may have a variety of year classes, it's how many fish are in those year classes (especially the ones that reproduce) that is of importance. If a lot of slot fish are taken in a given year on the lake (especially with the potential of this tourney if there were in fact a lot of fish deaths), that means there are not many fish left over that become those prime spawning fish. This can cause a great reduction of younger fish over the next couple years as the leftover large fish slowly die off, and the prime spawner population slowly drops as the slot size population drops."
705932,hirk,2012-06-14 22:39:00,571,"Who considers it fragile? Centainly not the mnr as evidenced by the current slot regs. Even IF there was a problem and mortality was over 10% and say as high as 25% To put it into context  2,3,4,5 times that number are harvested every week there in season. If you think its fragile then question the limit/slot regs not a one time event."
705933,esoxansteel,2012-06-14 22:40:00,1307,"Nice to have the truth from someone who fished the tournament from start to finish, thanx Garnet, an excellent read  "
705949,mike rousseau,2012-06-14 23:37:00,4661,Sounds like an awesome tourny...  Our walleye tournaments are amateur at best... All fish are released at the weigh in dock... Cooler for a pre weigh in tank... Fished weighed in a plastic tub on a deli scale....  And the only fish that seem to die do so before the weight in...  I've only ever seen one dead walleye(that I can remember)  on the river...in my life... And it was decapitated...
705989,Garfisher,2012-06-15 02:24:00,229,"Found a pic online of what was hidden in the release boat:   Looks like plenty of dead fish to me, mortality was much much higher than 25% judging from that picture. Both days were apparently like this."
706032,Big Cliff,2012-06-15 09:25:00,6899,"Now that is just plain sad and illeagal! I think someone should get charged for allowing those fish to be wasted. It isn't the fact that some fish died which is bad enough, it is that they were allowed to go to waste. I have never had a problem with tournaments before but I sure do now!"
706041,beagle dad,2012-06-15 10:07:00,224,whoa!!!!!!!!   if this indeed is tourn. pics yes sad  fish gone to waste NOT  assured they would be cleaned shared amoungst volunteers  PROOF PLS...have seen pics like this through ssfc and mnr seizures and netting programs for teaching programs
706047,beagle dad,2012-06-15 10:31:00,224,"people post pics   ""found this online"" you got facts you member p3ta or where you there when showed baby seal being clubbed  not sure what to  think of these people  they save animals only to put them all down secretly"
706048,Garnet,2012-06-15 10:36:00,2056,I see bags dead fish a hose. I don't see any proof.  Again if their is a problem. The Angler's take the blame. I know our fish were in good shape when presented to the weight station.  1 of my buddy's text me yesterday to say over 900 fish were caught so 10% would be 90 fish and your contention of 25% would be 225 fish.   We need a few more pic. to get to 225 dead fish.
706049,hirk,2012-06-15 10:59:00,571,"Garfish you seem to be going out of your way too push your point of some fish mortality,do you have a agenda your not reveiling? Are you anti tournament? Read my previous post IF your really concerned about the fishery. This event injected ALOT of money into the local economy and you either intentionally or by default are tarnishing it with speclulation and sensationalism."
706054,beagle dad,2012-06-15 11:17:00,224,i challenge all those skeptic to get out to a live release tourn... educate yourselves..see the care taken by most anglers and tournament officials to assure the fish get back in the water alive live release organizations are those looking out for the future of our fisheries imagine NO fish left if you keep all you catch and more...dont beliieve? then why the keep limits less and a slot size to boot..this don't come about from people letting them go!
706077,johnnyb,2012-06-15 12:45:00,3413,"I saw the same pics.  Posted by a fellow who claims he was there and watched the whole weigh-in and ""release"" procedure.  ""Release"" being in quotes, because as he claims, most of the fish came back in bags.  He also claims that there is now an investigation going on, so, maybe in a few months we'll hear something about it."
706134,Sinker,2012-06-15 15:56:00,8692," Ya, sure did. But NONE of it will ever go back into the fishery!!! Maybe if they donated a few of those dollars into the fishery, I wouldn't be so opposed.    The fellow who claims he was there would not  Bull. He has been involved with the fishery on sturgeon lake for many, many years. Any member of this site who attended fleming college would know him. He is a stand up guy who knows his fish biology, and cares about the fishery. He has seen the changes in that lake take place in front of his eyes. He isn't just joe blow.....he has a scientific background, and a looooong list of colleagues that support him.  Bottom line is, the tourney wasn't a good idea on sturgeon lake. It had an impact on the fishery for sure, and once the investigation comes to a close, we will all find out what ""really"" happened.  Keep in mind, a lot of dead fish will sink, and never be seen again. Even the floaters will be taken by birds and other critters, before they are noticed by people.  There is a lot more to think about with a walleye tourney than a bass tourney. Walleye use up to 3X more oygen than a bass, and require much colder water. Comparing this to a bass tourney is apples and oranges.    S."
706150,petegarnier,2012-06-15 16:51:00,1,"Couldn't agree more Garnett - 100% Phenominal event! Can't wait for next year - I know the organisers will again be working hard to ensure another great event in 2013. They are 100% committed to the resource, the community, and the competitors.  is there room for improvement - absolutely - but this year's Canada/ US Walleye Tournament was one very well run and organised event I assure you! Roo for improvement - absolutely; and I am 100% confident the committed group behind this event will be taking whatever measured necessary to deliver and even better event next season!  alter ........  G!  (if you want to call me dp - im in the book)   "
706184,Garfisher,2012-06-15 20:21:00,229,"I am by no means trying to push an agenda to eliminate all tourney fishing (nor a member of P3TA), hell I'm for tournament fishing. Tourneys are a lot of fun, they do bring in money into the local economy, and everyone has a great time. What I am against is a tourney where a coolwater species is targetted during a warmwater period on a lake where the population has dropped a substantial amount. If this tournament was held either within the 1st 2 weeks of Walleye opener, or from late sept. into the fall when the water is cooler, I wouldn't have a problem with it. I do believe the anglers did their absolute best to make sure that the walleye they were bringing in were as healthy as possible, and treated as well as possible. I believe more of the actual damage would have been done due to temperature shock induced by putting the warm-acclimated walleye into water that had been iced (Preslie observed this, and I haven't seen any other accounts as to what the release boat water was like so this is really the only info on that), and that more fish might have died being put from the chilled water (being already stressed from the firsth thermal shock) back into the warm lake. I should have actually talked about the picture when I posted it, instead of just posting ""found this, this looks like more than 25% mortality"" (and if I offended anyone in that post or any of my previous posts in this thread, I am indeed sorry for it). It's a picture Preslie himself took while at the tourney (as mentioned before by Sinker). Considering that picture (I'm guessing 40-60 fish) was only on the saturday, there were probably more fish on sunday due to it being a lot warmer. Plus there were released fish that were reported to have died as well, and fish that organizers took home, although exact numbers aren't certain for sure. What exactly happened that tourney, as in how many fish died, we may not know for a couple weeks/months (if there is an investigation), or we may never know (and I shouldn't have jumped to conclusions, again I'm sorry for that). All we can really do is wait and offer possible ideas until new information is uncovered/released for us to look at and interpret."
706194,Garnet,2012-06-15 22:11:00,2056,Dr. Bruce Tuff has studied this icing of live wells how much how often and all these live release boats are well aware of this research.  I read about 1/3 of this guys post. Just Crap.  I think he has agenda.  Sturgeon is the healthiest it's been in 30 years. The old days you could 30-50 walleye all the exact same size. That is a sick fishier. Now we have 8-9 year classes.  All the good walleye anglers know why the fishing was tough last weekend. The same reason I struggled on Balsam today.
706220,Big Cliff,2012-06-15 23:37:00,6899,"I've been doing a lot more reading since I started this thread! My conclusion is this: If all tourniments are run as efficently as this one was then all tourniments should be banned and the people responsible for the fish killed as a result of this tourniment should face jail and fines!  I live here, I pay taxes here, probably more in taxes every year than this whole tourniment generated in revenue for the area and I don't take more than 6-8 walleye a year for the table.  I'll risk the sensors and say that the reports of this tourniment being good for the area and well run are ""BULL POOP""!  I will now be fighting to reduce or eliminate ANY tourniments from this lake!"
704544,Big Cliff,2012-06-11 08:44:00,6899,"There was a fishing tournament on Sturgeon Lake this weekend, I believe it was out of the Bobcayegon area. I was trying to find the results on line but can't seem to get any.  I did talk to a couple of boats on the water and they reported fishing was extreamly slow. I had much the same luck, I caught more muskie than I did walleye.  Also, if you were fishing the tournament and lost a hat on Sunday morning, I have it, it blew out of your boat as you went past me. Give me a shout I'll get it back to you. I'd have brought it back in person but my top speed is about 32 mph, you were long gone before I could even get my motor started LOL."
704548,Roy,2012-06-11 09:32:00,13728,"Someone here should know, Cliff. It's not up on the official site yet. Do you happen to know how many teams were registered?"
704551,Big Cliff,2012-06-11 09:50:00,6899,"No I don't Roy but at one point I'll bet there were at least 25 or 30 boats out in front of our place fishing Goose Bay. In a couple of hours fishing I only saw one walleye caught, there might have been more but not that I could see. Goose Bay is a pretty big area!  I would have thought that Saturday would have been a excellent walleye day, overcast with rain showers moving through the area all morning and a warm front moving in. Should have been ideal walleye weather but to the best of my knowledge it was very slow."
704575,Harrison,2012-06-11 12:08:00,2202,"Not sure the wining weights but I was told last night it was won by Dan Risorto and Jeff Salazar of Durham Region.  I would guess probably 20lbs or so won it, tough fishing with the slot in a tournie format.  This is the Canada/US walleye T which returned this year held by the Bobcaygeon Chamber of Commerce.  There was over 110 boats from what I was told.  I fished it 10 or so years ago and will again next year."
704605,manjo39,2012-06-11 13:46:00,354,"  Hey Cliff, thought I saw you out there (from a distance) on Saturday, a ways out in front of your place.  I wasn't in the tourney, but Walleye fishing nonetheless.  Same thing for me, I found the Walleye fishing tough, but the incidental Musky good.  I was thinking of bringing my 7 year old to the weigh in, but wasn't sure if the make it into an event - my son likes to see big fish."
704615,Garnet,2012-06-11 14:18:00,2056,Da couch won with 20.96 (I think) and 9th was 16.29 and checks started in the 12lb area. There was 116 teams. Don't think I ever fished so hard for 9 walleyes. All anglers talked about overs and the number off musky caught  Was a great well run tournament parking at the fair grounds was great.
704799,Jer,2012-06-11 20:50:00,1426,"How would a tourney like this work with the slot-size taken into account?  I can't see 4 fish with a maximum of 19.7"" each, possibly weighing more than 20 lbs."
704809,esoxansteel,2012-06-11 21:17:00,1307,"    i believe it was a 2 day event, but dont quote me, Garnet might chime in 2 clarify or someone else who fished it."
704812,Big Cliff,2012-06-11 21:23:00,6899,"Wouldn't it be a total of 8 fish for the boat or does each angler have to enter their seperate weights?  I just heard from a friend today that there were some dead walleye washed up on shore, mostly smaller ones near the lower end of the slot. I wonder if it had anything to do with the tourny and people culling? I really hope not but we haven't seen any on previous weekends."
704821,Roy,2012-06-11 21:41:00,13728,"With a 4 fish limit and a 35-50cm slot,the minimum weight you could register for a limit is 3.8lbs and the maximum you could attain is 12lbs."
704848,Dutch,2012-06-11 22:43:00,831,"This was a two day tourney with fish requied to be in the slot.  Each team could weigh-in 6 fish per day - being a single angler would be a strategic disadvantage in this one.  I am assuming the winning team weighed in 12 fish for the two-day tourney.  Here is the website for those that want more info:  http://www.bobcaygeon.org/CanUsWalleyeTournament.html  The tournament was run by a great organizing commitee and everything was done in accordance with MNR regulations.  No live bait allowed either.  Prize payouts were some of the best in the industry based on the entry fee and I bet the field will be full next year.  I'm not much of a walleye fisherman, but with the good payouts and all the extra draws, might take a gamble next year."
704864,Big Cliff,2012-06-11 23:41:00,6899,Thanks for posting that Dutch!
704997,Garnet,2012-06-12 11:47:00,2056,"6 fish 2 days and the organizers provided culling boards for each team. Sunday was brutal hot, but we had no problem with our fish.  Was really nice to see lot's of smaller boats,husband wife(I assume),young guys. For a $169 entry fee the draw prizes were almost worth the enter. Ever motel had increased business from what I seen and of course Tim's was under staff each morning.  Somebody weight a 3.09 walleye that surprised me,so 18lb per would be possible."
705004,beagle dad,2012-06-12 12:02:00,224,i know a friend who was in 3rd after sat. with over 11 lbs
705539,jerdog,2012-06-13 21:35:00,39,"There's some reports on other boards that post weigh-in mortality may have been an issue.  No first hand knowledge from me, just what I've seen in other locations.  Can anybody confirm, deny, comment?"
705540,Big Cliff,2012-06-13 21:39:00,6899," That would explain the number of dead walleye washing up on shore. Very sad if it is true! There is a lot of shore line on Sturgeon Lake, finding one is bad but my friend saw several in a small area."
705576,Garnet,2012-06-13 23:21:00,2056,I seen 3 dead walleye in practice and a few perch and sunnies. Unfortunately all tournaments get to own all dead fish.  The organizer get put in a tough spot with the 8oz dead fish penalty. If the fish is moving the anglers want a live fish and if it dies after the organizers own it.  Walleye are the hardest to keep alive. They use 3 times the oxygen as a smallmouth.
705588,Garfisher,2012-06-13 23:48:00,229,Considering what they were put through at the weigh in (from what I heard) I wouldnt be surprised if all the weighed-in walleye croaked
705632,Sinker,2012-06-14 02:07:00,8692," I thought I had already posted that in this thread......I must be losing it  I agree. Not a good idea. Too late in the season, water was too warm, and I'd bet my paycheck more than half of the fish weighed in are dead right now.  No money from that tourney went back to the fishery, but lined some peoples pockets. Not cool IMO. The resource is worth more. Sturgeon has had a couple tough years, and was just starting to recover. I hope this isn't a set back for the walleye in there. I stopped fishing it all together. Not worth it for eyes anyways.  S."
705678,Garnet,2012-06-14 08:07:00,2056,"So you haven't been on Sturgeon this year last year or the year before or the year before that.  The water temp. was 65.4 main lake and 67.8 way up Goose Bay and the river too the rail line. Hardly high water temp.  Just so you ""Know"" The sat. before Canada/US I caught 5 walleye in the 12.5 - 14.5"" class That's 1 year class.  Just so you ""Know"" on tues. before the Canada/US I caught 9 walleyes in the 8-10"" class. Yes I was swimming crappie tubes for crappie. That's another year class.  The lake is crammed with slot's. That's another 2 year classes.  The overs I caught were between 4-6 lbs. That's another 2 year classes.  And I heard of fish over 8 lb. This is another year class or 2.  Hardly a fragile fishery."
705686,Stoty,2012-06-14 09:31:00,2910, Whaaaa happen?!
705690,Garnet,2012-06-14 10:14:00,2056,"So far nothing. Tournament anglers will be responsible for every dead fish for the next month.  When I get back back from Simcoe whitefish gig today I will talk about how well the tournament was run. Right from parking to weighting the fish.  If and I don't think their was a problem the angler will need to take responsibility.  Lets just run some #'s ""I HEARD"" 680 walleyes caught.  10/680=.015%  20/680=.o3%  50/580=.07%  Let's just say all the REC anglers caught 100 walleyes on Sturgeon last Sat. and Sun. How many are still in Sturgeon Lake."
705695,Big Cliff,2012-06-14 10:25:00,6899,"I have lived here for 12 years now and the last 4 or 5 I have seen a huge drop in the number of walleye I could catch in a day. Yes, I can still put fish in the boat but nothing like it was when we first moved here. I really believe there are several factors and sport fishing isn't one of them, it may be a contributor but I believe most of them are environmental. Zebra mussles, cormorants, and water quality are having far more impact than any fishing tournament."
705696,Stoty,2012-06-14 10:29:00,2910,"  Amen brother! Why they haven't had an ""open season"" on cormorants... blows my mind!"
705737,beagle dad,2012-06-14 12:41:00,224,over the yrs of tournament fishing mnr has been involved they ran tagging programs in the past at walleye and bass tournaments having been involved in this you would be surprised at how low the mortality rate is for tournament fish low enough..that it is a belief that the improper release of fish by rec. anglers is a bigger issue hence the law change to allow culling by the mnr
