Good luck with the Asses err ahh i mean the Masses.. no one cares so long as Kanye west keeps being stupid and pay day is Friday..I gave up the good fight.. I grow organically and source as much meat from local organic farmers..To heck with the rest..Who ever posted the graph linking Autism with organic farming..Please for the love of Christ, STOP IT.. It was meant tongue-in-cheek. I saw it first when people were linking autism with vaccines.  Anyway, I'd rather eat organic etc. too, but some of the fear mongering over GMOs is a bit much. And I'm pretty sure it all comes about because of ONE company who is trying to patent life forms and allegedly screws over farmers.  GM crops can be modified such that they're drought resistant, require less watering, are less taxing on soil and a plethora of other beneficial attributes. But, instead, in typical hysterical internet fashion everyone focuses their attention on the fear mongering and shocking stories of the vast minority of situations where things are bad. There would be a lot more vegetarians if everyone here already didn't have a taste for meat and paid attention to this stuff the same way P3TA et. al. report on the meat industry.  Over-use of chemicals in farming is not good. In no way would I support that. But if I'm going to be completely honest with myself, Roundup and similar products are a lot less harmful than some other options and even some stuff that gets used in organic farming. Organic farming on its own tends to be far more labour intensive, less productive, and more taxing on the soil. Certain varieties of GMOs farmed organically can fill that gap.  tl;dr - GMOs can be organic too, and beneficial to feeding our over-populated planet."

Don't get me wrong i use no chemicals in my recreational garden but if it was for profit I would use ever means needed to keep in competition with others and to maximize my profits. At times it is cheaper to pay the penalty than to stop using an illegal compound. Case in point is in 1974 an ice maker was sited for polluting the bayous of Louisiana the fine was $50,000.00 a week and for 3 years they paid the fine. Then it went to 100,000.00 and they shut down and moved the factory. The down side was 60% of the economy in the area died that day. All of this revolved around money and when big business left it was still a money issue since no more paychecks. On personal levels it is easy to see and say that is wrong we got to stop but in real life the domino effect has a shock wave that on a personal level view just does not take in account. The reality is that big business will continue there ways and YOU have the right and the ability to not support or buy their products. If you choose to not support lets say just the gasoline industry (disregarding all of the petroleum product and byproducts for simplicity) then you should not complain that someone drives a car or boat. It is the freedom of choice that is just as important as the rights of people who choose to not use gasoline.  Art"

One interesting point that could easily be missed in your video, is amid all the talk about how ""special interest groups"" are making a farmer's life harder, they point out that Europe has already banned GMO crops.  I haven't heard of a mass famine over there after all their farmers went out of business.  I haven't argued for a ban on Glyphosate. Although I would like to see one, I'm not usually one to advocate prohibitions as solutions. In the end a ban may not be necessary.  If the masses want non-GMO crops (and I'm not saying they do yet, just saying if), then farmers will have to grow what people want or go out of business. That's how markets work.

It's very easy to say that we need to get rid of all round-up ready and GMO plants and go back to organic. That's great if you live in a first world country and make enough money to afford expensive food. Because without GMO's our crop yield goes way down, world hunger increases, and prices go up.

I sprayed this stuff for weed control in orchards and vineyards in my teens and as a Forester U of T 74 , I know it was used in copious amounts by roadcrews, railways and hydro crews for weed and brush control on railway lines and hydro right of ways at that time. You can buy Roundup, without a permit for small time weed control at CTC, this stuff is banned by International Treaties.  https://www.ontario.ca/page/contact-herbicide-245-t  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2,4,5-Trichlorophenoxyacetic_acid"

969440,netminder,2016-05-13 14:45:00,514,"FYI - Organic isn't necessarily better. Organic farmers still use fertilizer, pesticide and herbicide. Just different ""organic"" varieties. And those organic chemicals can often be even more toxic and harmful to the environment than anything Monsanto, BASF or Dow puts out.  Also, the people who put out these cutesy YouTube videos or ""documentaries"" aren't 100% honest with people either. They have an agenda to push and they want to show something compelling. For example, I'm sure some people have seen the documentary Gasnation where there was a scene with an individual's faucet lights on fire. Turns out that the cause of the methane in his water had nothing to do with fracking, but it looked scary and people ate it up.  GMO's are saving lives and feeding millions of people around the world. I do have a problem with some of the unethical things Monsanto does, but you can't discount all GMOs because of one company."
969446,Dutch01,2016-05-13 15:14:00,1431,"Roundup (Glyphosate) is nasty stuff.  It was originally an industrial de-scaling agent that was repurposed as a herbicide.  It has no business being in our food.  The World Health Organization  has declared it a probable carcinogen, and I believe it damages the gut biome and causes autoimmune disorders (personal opinion alert!).  I don't claim that the following video is from an unbiased source, but from my additional reading the science is pretty accurate as far as I can tell.  "

I now stay away from wheat products, but occasionally have some during a weak moment. On Wednesday I ate some nice Italian bread, on Thursday I had to take the day off work due to severe cramps and acid reflux. Prior to the 1980's this was not an issue."

969461,netminder,2016-05-13 17:18:00,514,"I'd be cautious about drawing conclusions from perceived correlations. Just because your gut (pun intended) tells you something is true doesn't mean it is.  My favourite chart when talking about this type of stuff:    And as for ""engineered"" foods, have you ever seen the ancient strain of grass that was bred into becoming corn today? genetic modification is just an advanced form of selective breeding.    And most of this was done by Native Americans prior to European colonization.  I don't want to sound condescending here, but a lot of this is simply fear of science. There is nothing inherently wrong with GMOs.  As for glyphosate, again I'm not going to support Monsanto. And it's true that it is a 'probable carcinogen."" But do you know what else are probable carcinogens?  Frying, emissions from high-temperature.  Hairdresser or barber (workplace exposure as).  Red meat (consumption of).  Shiftwork that involves circadian disruption."

969466,Dutch01,2016-05-13 17:56:00,1431," As for probable carcinogens, sure there are lots. It doesn't mean that I want to intake an industrial de-scaling agent with my vegetables, and it is becoming increasingly hard to make an informed choice. Monsanto spends hundreds of millions of dollars fighting labeling so that I can't make an informed choice about what I eat.  I would encourage everyone to watch the video I posted.  It's not a slick Al Gore style ""documentary"" (does that qualify as an oxymoron?).  It is a lecture about how Glyphosate works, in the field and in your body."
