971297,mattyk,2016-05-26 21:27:00,2110,I was out fishing for smallmouth this morning with jig/worm combo on 6lb line. I didn't catch any bass but I did land two nice catfish and carp. They put up crazy fights on the light action rod with 6lb test. The big cat took me 30 minutes to land. Excuse my silly facial expressions. It was hard trying to do a selfie and hold up the bigger fish.    .

971440,mattyk,2016-05-27 18:09:00,2110,I let them go. The waters here are pretty contaminated with heavy metals.
971643,Joeytier,2016-05-29 02:16:00,3990,I let them go. The waters here are pretty contaminated with heavy metals. That's unfortunate.  Are those flatheads or channels?
971649,mattyk,2016-05-29 10:11:00,2110,Flatheads. We have channel cats and blues too.
