972186,FLEX ROD,2016-06-03 11:56:00,394,"Hello folks, once again I am turning to this site for some help, due to my health I am looking at buying some land around the Flesherton area that will have to be cleared and then build on, but what I would like to do is put up a bunkie so that I have a place to stay temporally while we build.  I have not started my search yet, it does not necessarily have to be a "" Bunkie "" I just want something to come up to and be able to stay in.  The possibility of looking at a trailer is also an option but that would be my second choice as I would like to re use after the initial  use is completed.  What suggestions do you have of locating said "" Bunkie "" in the Flesherton / Markdale area?  Thanks in advance,   FLEX  "

I get you may not have the time to do so hence why asking where to buy so if no time to do so, buy a pop up camper so it can be used for the future too."
