Interesting  Black rockfish breed via internal fertilization, meaning that female members of the species store sperm until the development of the eggs. The phases between the start of the process and the end are separated by several months. The majority of the young are reared in late winter to early spring. Females produce between 125,000 and 1,200,000 eggs every breeding season. However it has been noted that not all of the eggs are released every year. It has been occasionally observed that the female may absorb the eggs back into her system.[3]"

Always check the regulations for the zone in which you are fishing to ensure that you arent exceeding the catch and possession limit for that Zone.  Walleye is max 6, no matter where they were caught."

971590,Sterling,2016-05-28 16:48:00,477,Seems like it would be really hard for COs to convict anyone on that.  What if I hold an Ontario and Quebec license? Do my possession limits stack?  What about fish I purchased? Can I buy 20 fillets from Eagle's Nest and still be legal? What if I keep that receipt and use it to pretend the fish in my freeze was purchased?  For the record there's 1 fish in my freeze and it's an Aurora - I don't break the rules. Devil's advocate always brings heat to a discussion.

971391,Dara,2016-05-27 15:40:00,3052,I just heard the boys are asking how many fish you have at home in your freezer and counting it towards your daily limit.  Tickets can be issued for over limits
971394,Freshtrax,2016-05-27 15:50:00,2215,lol its a  catch and possession limit been that way for as long as i can remember
971397,Joeytier,2016-05-27 15:51:00,3990,"So if your possession limit is 5 and they ask how many you have in your possession, don't say more than 5  et voila"

971444,Dara,2016-05-27 19:04:00,3052,"Sinker  I believe only Until it gets to your house, then you can skin it and freeze it. In camp or for transport it needs skin.  They are only asking the question to catch you up, they aren't going to your house to check. Once you admit to over limit its ticket time...tell the judge you didn't mean it  Mr manitou, we eat fresh fish because we can go get em pretty much any day.some people have to stock a freezer which is totally illegal. And I wish all status card holders were as considerate"
971446,Joeytier,2016-05-27 19:14:00,3990,"Sinker is right.  If a CO looks in your freezer and finds skinless fish, you're getting a fine 100%"
