We have been going to a spot in the Muskokas for a looong time. It never fails to produce some decent fish. 31 lbrs have been caught there in past years. This time around, we landed 3 10 lb fish, a 9lbr, a few 2-5 lbrs that graced the pan while we still fished on and a 14 and a half pounder was the big fish. A buddy broke the cardinal rule and brought his 9 year old son up, we let him reel in the big fish. While our wives and children have NEVER been allowed we made an exception this time. The look on his face when he saw the fish go in the net was priceless. The next generation will be ready in a few years. He could not get enough freshly caught freshly fried up spring pike, I thought he would burn himself... good times with good friends."

971795,Old Ironmaker,2016-05-30 14:21:00,8243,It sounds like a great trip. I know the feeling when the young bucks started joining us. Now some of them have kids wanting to go along too. I don't like it when a 14 year old out drives me on our golf day though let alone out fish me.
971865,bigbuck,2016-05-30 22:56:00,2449,My kids really want to get out too. We'll be back fishing Lake 'X' again Friday morning for a few hours.
