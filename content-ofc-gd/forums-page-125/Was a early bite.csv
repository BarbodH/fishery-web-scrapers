970738,misfish,2016-05-23 15:40:00,29133,"6:30 AM, I had my whities 2/3, Then I  headed out for lakers. No lakers would commit,but had alot of follows. Nice to fish without all those bugs. Not sure why they seem to be out on the main lake and not here in the bay.  Another great dinner to come tonight. I love my white fish.      Trimmed out like a fish monger. LOL     "
970746,Joeytier,2016-05-23 16:42:00,3990,"Nice going again.  I bought that same stringer last year, those little plastic clips break very easily and big fish can get off, so I can bought the metal version, the one with shrink tubing over the chain so it's not super noisy."
970748,Carp,2016-05-23 16:46:00,1488,"Good shooting Brian. One of these days I'll catch up with everything on my ""TO DO"" list and get out there. Or......maybe play hooky and go fishing. Wouldn't be the first time."
970759,Rodbender,2016-05-23 17:52:00,1027,Nice fish again Brian
970761,misfish,2016-05-23 18:33:00,29133,"Some will be fish on a bun, some will be tacos for dinner tuesday night.      Keeping it reeling ,keep it real."

970789,Freshtrax,2016-05-24 00:45:00,2215,Nice going ... Wish I knew how to catch whities   on lady 0
970791,irishfield,2016-05-24 01:04:00,26272,"DANG.. almost missed a fishing report. Great stuff Brian, you've got more energy that me!"
970832,Rod Caster,2016-05-24 09:38:00,5784,that bowl of whitefish meat is something to be proud of
970840,Fish Farmer,2016-05-24 12:15:00,2234,"Way to go Bro, nice side of Fiddleheads would be nice. Going to have to make a boat whitie day up there, not doing much on L. O or L. E"
970843,PUMP KNOWS,2016-05-24 12:58:00,937,That looks so yummy
970870,MJL,2016-05-24 16:54:00,2427,Is there room for a 2nd person on that pontoon? haha  Nicely done Brian
970940,Terry,2016-05-24 20:23:00,14456,"good report, its almost like I was there   oh wait I was, guess I should have taken some photos too..lol  still going flat"
970943,misfish,2016-05-24 20:29:00,29133,"Way to go Bro, nice side of Fiddleheads would be nice. Going to have to make a boat whitie day up there, not doing much on L. O or L. E PM sent in a bit me bye.  Is there room for a 2nd person on that pontoon? haha  Nicely done Brian  I thought you were going to buy one mike?   Nice going again. I bought that same stringer last year, those little plastic clips break very easily and big fish can get off, so I can bought the metal version, the one with shrink tubing over the chain so it's not super noisy.  I double up on the clips, plus the whities are not that visous on the stringer. A laker, if I were to keep it,would be on a rope.   good report, its almost like I was there   oh wait I was, guess I should have taken some photos too..lol  still going flat  This is not good buddy. You already know what I went through. Cheaper to buy a new one for me. Hope you get it fixed up. Then again, you have a back up in the garage. LOL"
971146,akaShag,2016-05-25 23:45:00,2073,"I really HATE stringers.  But I guess there is no room on the small boat for a cooler and ice............  NICE whities, I am jealous!Doug"
971149,misfish,2016-05-25 23:59:00,29133,"I agree Doug. But with surface temps at 10 deg. The fish stayed cold . I could add a small cooler to the back, behind the seat, but that would mean more wieght. Terry has a nice small live basket. I have yet to find one like he has."
971216,Ralph Field,2016-05-26 13:40:00,1018,"A friend of mine used a nylon bag, usually used to hold a bunch of basketballs, as a live net and never seemed to have any problems with it. I'm sure with your ingenuity that you could set it up to work with your toon."
971236,fishnsled,2016-05-26 16:03:00,3520,That is a good morning on the water!!  Good shooting Brian!
971237,SirCranksalot,2016-05-26 16:07:00,3291,"The $ store usually sells mesh bags in different colors, but I'm not sure if they would fit a bigger fish. What about a big onion bag with a draw string.  (Nice going-------I've only caught 1 whitie myself. The ones I have eaten were bought and they were indeed delicious.)"
971375,ehg,2016-05-27 14:21:00,2666,Another great report! Simcoe produces good.
