971511,leaf4,2016-05-28 00:14:00,2466,"Hey, with all the heat I tried using my air conditioning and all I got was muggy warm air, I checked the psi on the low side of my ac lines with a gauge and came out with 38 psi which I believe is adequate, wondering what other troubleshooting I should do?  I did some research already and it was suggested that disconnecting the battery for at least ten minutes would reset the computer and others have had success with that but it hasn't worked for me so far.  The car is a 2011 Tucson, thanks for any input"
971513,ecmilley,2016-05-28 00:18:00,2163,38 psi static pressure or running? If not running 38psi way to low considering temp out today. U most likely have a leak
971515,Steve Piggott,2016-05-28 00:32:00,196,Just recharged my F 150 had the same problem. It works great now.
971516,leaf4,2016-05-28 00:33:00,2466,38psi was while it was running on full and from what I've read that seems to be normal according to other Tucson owners
971521,BillM,2016-05-28 01:10:00,17367,Is the compressor kicking on?  Could be as simple as a bad coil.
971522,leaf4,2016-05-28 01:13:00,2466,Not that I have heard now that you mention it... any ballpark estimate on replacing it?
971536,ecmilley,2016-05-28 02:30:00,2163,If your compressor not kicking on the 38psi is defiantly low. Without a high side number not conclusive
971551,grimsbylander,2016-05-28 03:31:00,3016,I have a 2007 Civic the the compressor clutch is not engaging. Quote was $1200...ouch.
971571,Ralph Field,2016-05-28 12:51:00,1018,You may be able to buy a used compressor for far less than 1000 at an auto wreckers but it may be no better than the one you have.
971574,Canuck2fan,2016-05-28 13:24:00,1444,Check out videos on compressor clutch gap problems. Could be as simple as renting a tool to tighten the clutch so it engages.... if your compressor isn't engaging like you suspect.  
971575,BillM,2016-05-28 13:40:00,17367,"Like I said before, check the coil.  A simple resistance test is all that's needed.   These go on the VWs and people spend way too  much money swapping compressors when a $35 coil would have solved the problem."
971613,leaf4,2016-05-28 20:43:00,2466,"Cool will do and report back my findings, thank you"
971625,Dave Bailey,2016-05-29 00:13:00,1641,"I have a 2007 Civic the the compressor clutch is not engaging. Quote was $1200...  SHAZBAT! I can remember when you could buy a new car for not much more than that. Yes, I'm that old."
