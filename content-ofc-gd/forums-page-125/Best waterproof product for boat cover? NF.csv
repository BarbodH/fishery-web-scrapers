I give it a coat of Scotch Guard every few seasons and it took 100 bucks worth last time. Other than the water proof it's in great shape for 21 years old. I can get a new one made locally for $700.00. It's not in the budget right now. Considering what they want to shrink wrap plus waterproofing every few years that's really the wise thing to do I think. B.O.A.T. Bring out another thousand is an understatement."

971289,DRIFTER_016,2016-05-26 21:02:00,10439,I wonder how using some Thompsons Water Seal would work. At $18 a gallon it may be an alternative to expensive Scotch Guard.  http://www.canadiantire.ca/en/pdp/thompson-s-original-water-seal-0491467p.html#srp  This one even has UV inhibitors in it.  http://www.canadiantire.ca/en/pdp/thompson-s-waterseal-advanced-multi-surface-protector-0488805p.html#srp   And another option from a different manufacturer. Even says it's for use on fabrics as well as wood etc. And it's cheaper even!!!!  http://www.canadiantire.ca/en/pdp/rez-water-repellent-sealer-0488610p.html#srp

971304,Old Ironmaker,2016-05-26 21:36:00,8243,You mean boathouse don't you? I can't build a garage here but I can get a permit for a boathouse. I would need one at the Marina too. Thompsons will make it crack. Thanks anyway.

971359,sofabed,2016-05-27 02:42:00,119,I also use the 303 fabric guard from Costco. Used to buy it from amazon however Costco now has it cheaper.
971365,Lape0019,2016-05-27 12:32:00,647,303 is what was recommended to me as well.
971564,spincast,2016-05-28 10:17:00,3279,liquid silicone from the camping section at your local ctc. spray on. We used to use it on our older tents when we were frequent campers - works great.
971788,Old Ironmaker,2016-05-30 14:09:00,8243,"Thanks for all the replies. A rep for 303 is sending me a gallon to try and review, no charge. Can't turn that deal down."

I had a great uncle in Buffalo that was very generous every Christmas, one Christmas he wasn't at my Nani and Nono's for dinner. I asked my Nani ""where's Uncle Sammy Nani?"", ""oh filiglio mio he went to college"" she told me, for how long I asked? ""for 7 to 10."""
