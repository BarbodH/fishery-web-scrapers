971948,mike rousseau,2016-05-31 22:00:00,4661,Hey guys  Just want to share the savings on this sale  Cabelas Canada has a good sale on now plus free shipping over $99  The guidewear is about $100 off each piece so $200 off a suit with the free shipping is a solid deal... Around $550 taxes in shipped for a parka and bibs...  I'm replacing my suit because my jacket flew out of my boat a few years back and I miss having it constantly but was waiting for a good sale...  Anyways hopefully someone else can share in the savings...
972015,AKRISONER,2016-06-01 17:08:00,5558,i wonder how long their free shipping deal is going to last.  They have some good deals on fly fishing stuff right now and I am getting outfitted big time
