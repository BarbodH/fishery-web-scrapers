972035,manitoubass2,2016-06-01 21:35:00,11391,Thats a mighty gator for sure!!!
972037,Old Ironmaker,2016-06-01 22:04:00,8243,I've seen smaller Gators in the Everglades. She is one hefty beasty. How old would a fish like that be to get that large way up in God's country?
972038,DRIFTER_016,2016-06-01 22:11:00,10439,Hard to say how old it is. It really depends on the lake. We have a lake in town that grows fish quickly because it's warm compared to the larger lakes around.
972060,Gallie,2016-06-02 11:14:00,1215,That is a massive fish! i live in the wrong province lol.
972074,AKRISONER,2016-06-02 15:02:00,5558,a fish that size on great slave has got to be at least 30 years old.  Incredible. That thing makes the  trophy musky i see guys catch look like dinks.
972087,DRIFTER_016,2016-06-02 15:57:00,10439,This one was caught in a tiny little lake here in town. Pretty hard to see exactly how big it is but look @ the head on this beast. It could swallow that kid whole!!!!
