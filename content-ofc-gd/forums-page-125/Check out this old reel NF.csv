971166,Tom S,2016-05-26 01:03:00,362,Found some info on it: http://fiberglassflyrodders.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=13031  French made multiplier fly reel.  Dang. Manitou beat me to it.
971169,manitoubass2,2016-05-26 01:11:00,11391,Lol. I still cant find a year?  Lotsa jokes about the maginot line however???
971171,GBW,2016-05-26 01:15:00,8460,"your guys ""surfing skills"" are very good.  As I mentioned to Rick via FB msg, this is a reel that will be passed down to my kids like some do with rings.  It still works like new too..."
971177,dave524,2016-05-26 02:12:00,4508,"Yeah Ill upload em geoff        Looks like an old multiplier fly reel, maybe an early Martin ?  Edit ooops missed a few posts"
971186,Old Ironmaker,2016-05-26 03:15:00,8243,"Very nice reel Geoff. That's the kind of stuff I look for. Old Bakelite reels, knuckle busters and steel rods. I have a shoe box full of Mitchel's now. Not enough walls to mount them.  This site is slower than the Raptors tonight."
971187,manitoubass2,2016-05-26 03:18:00,11391,"My bud has a crap ton of old mitchels too OI. I cant recall names but im pretty sure I seen a few called the 300??? Im not positive.  I couldnt get more pics tonight, hes not around so ill try again tomorrow"
971190,GBW,2016-05-26 04:32:00,8460,"Very nice reel Geoff. That's the kind of stuff I look for. Old Bakelite reels, knuckle busters and steel rods. This site is slower than the Raptors tonight. It is a ""gem"" in my eyes and may never be used again but it's a fully functional fly reel ready to go and my kids (I HOPE) keep it on a mantel like I do now.  My father is still alive and kicking (closing in on 65 ((only)) in 2 weeks) but we all have a keepsake of a moment right?  This reel is mine and SORRY Rick for a bit of a hijack here (in my eyes it was) but we all have a moment in out fishing history we cannot let go or want to keep close.  I have never seen my father use said reel but he was the man who got me into this lifestyle.  As for ""the Raptors"" is that a new storm or rapala bait?"
971192,manitoubass2,2016-05-26 04:54:00,11391,I derail threads all the time ???  No worries  Great plan to by the way!
971207,dave524,2016-05-26 12:18:00,4508,"All of the old stuff I've got from the 50's and 60's , I can tell you where I bought it, new.    The French made a lot of  excellent tackle back in the 40's and 50's, everyone knows Mitchell spinning reels but Luxor's were arguably a better reel and Pezon et Michel gear was for the elite. Dad was one of the original gear junkies"
971249,manitoubass2,2016-05-26 18:08:00,11391,Post pics if ya can! I love seeing this stuff!
971065,manitoubass2,2016-05-25 17:56:00,11391,My buddy pulled this out of storage yesterday. Pretty friggen cool if ya ask me!      
971066,grimsbylander,2016-05-25 18:01:00,3016,That's a very cool looking reel! Pull that out when the police stop you and you're likely to get shot! Where did you find it?
971067,manitoubass2,2016-05-25 18:10:00,11391,A buddy has had it sitting around forever.  It was his dads.  Its in pretty darm good shape too! Everything on it still works perfect.  I wonder what the age is on it? And what type of rod it would be paired with?  The insert on the top end is very small(the rod would insert into the reel)  Edit. A quick google search puts it at 1945-46
971070,cheaptackle,2016-05-25 18:36:00,849,"I wonder if that was a steel rod that went with it - not sure why but I also think it would have been used with steel line as well, mightn't be right on that part but something about it rings a bell...  Michael"
971071,AKRISONER,2016-05-25 18:40:00,5558,http://www.oldreels.com/hurd.htm  very cool from the 40's  what kind of line is that?!
971072,manitoubass2,2016-05-25 18:49:00,11391,No friggen clue on the line???  Its kinda stretchy and thick in diameter.  Its soft in texture too
971076,OhioFisherman,2016-05-25 19:06:00,6623,"Braided line was the "" thing "" in those days, mono-filament was a new deal and was rarely seen on anything but a spinning reel. Nylon or Dacron braid, Dacron didn't have much stretch."
971078,manitoubass2,2016-05-25 19:08:00,11391,"Maybe its nylon? Its def. Braided, but not like todays braid. Its very thick/soft and stretchy."
971084,OhioFisherman,2016-05-25 19:19:00,6623,"Braided line back then was far different than the braids of today! Nylon and Dacron were soft, I used both as a kid on my casting reels, early mono had a tendency to be stiff, I never even liked using a spinning reel because of it, then Berkley introduced the original Trilene, which was much better."
971087,Tom S,2016-05-25 19:23:00,362,Brings a new meaning to pistol grip.... I like it but I don't think I'd want to carry it around all day.  Most likely would have been paired with steel or solid fiberglass rod. Either a broomstick or nice and whippy.
971089,manitoubass2,2016-05-25 19:26:00,11391,Yeah its not light! I think the wood is walnut. Its very nice craftmanship though. I shoud take better pics  My guess would be fiberglass rod. See if I can google it lol
971090,OhioFisherman,2016-05-25 19:29:00,6623,"Detroit was known as Murder City back in the day, a pistol grip handle might have kept the bad guys at bay?"
971094,manitoubass2,2016-05-25 19:33:00,11391,Hahaha who knows???  After doing a lil research this guy invented a few neat gadgets in his day(anti vehicle theft devices etc)
971104,Old Ironmaker,2016-05-25 20:04:00,8243,"That has to be one of the coolest reels I have seen in a long time. I sort of pick them up when I see them cheap at a garage sale or Antique store and they don't know what they have. I have paid much more than they were asking, it's just the right thing to do I think.  More pics Rick please on a solid back ground so I can see the details. Email them if you wish, what ever is easy.  I doubt it but is he interested in selling it? I know I wouldn't even if it wasn't my fathers. He only passed on his old sledge hammers and tools to me. He had an old axe that was marked ""Tonys X"" on it. I still howl when I use it."
971112,manitoubass2,2016-05-25 20:13:00,11391,Ill get better picks tonight. Its really nice work.  Ill ask him if hes willing to sell and let ya know.  Hes got alot of old reels etc. His house is like a friggen museum of cool stuff.  And just the most random stuff too.  You know the pictures of dogs playing poker? I know youve seen some variation of it.  He has one and its from 1846.
971120,Old Ironmaker,2016-05-25 20:31:00,8243,Is Big Cliff in that picture from 1846? Now watch he is going to think I'm serious. Just kidding young fella.
