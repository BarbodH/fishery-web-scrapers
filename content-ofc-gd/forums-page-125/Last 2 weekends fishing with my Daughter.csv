970907,tb4me,2016-05-24 19:08:00,3295,So we spent a TON of time on the Trent river the last 2 weekends. My 15 yo daughter sure did WAY better then me..However I got the monster Walleye. 27.5 inch fish on the river. My heart was pounding so hard I didnt know if I was going to have a heart attack or not...lolHas anyone ever caught a Crappie trolling for pike? I did and it was a HUGE slab of a fish to.lolI caught the Walleye in 11 ft of water on a giant creek chub. I had a tape measure on board measured it up at 27.5 took a pic and sent it on its way. Any ideas on what it weighed at all?Guess what weekend this pic was taken? lolShe was fine with this one until I told her what kind of fish it was LMAOThe Pike were caught by her.. I got nothing that day but the  Crappie..caught this little GEM trolling.. a little taste of whats to come.Nikita on guard lolwent to get my ladder .. had to borrow a neighbors when i  seen these beauty'sThanks for looking and I hope your time spent on the water is every bit as good....
970915,Dara,2016-05-24 19:23:00,3052,"Looks nice, 27.5"" eye should be 6lbs or better"
970916,huzzsaba,2016-05-24 19:23:00,884,the ladies always catch the big fish!  Way to go!
970929,Terry,2016-05-24 20:08:00,14456,thats the best
970936,jimmer,2016-05-24 20:18:00,2730,I would say a Kawartha walleye that long would be about 6 lbs.
970941,misfish,2016-05-24 20:24:00,29133,Thanks for the post.  Beauty dog you got there.
970949,Old Ironmaker,2016-05-24 20:54:00,8243,"I would never make a fish bet with any woman, especially a teen. The yellow kicks must be the trick. I would think that Pic would go at least 7lbs depending on her girth. Could be 8 here on Erie.  Thank you for sharing great memories with us all.  Beauty Dog by the way. Did it get a taste of that fish it was so interested in?"
971018,can u fish,2016-05-25 10:53:00,326,Great way to spend the day with your daughter and the fish caught are a bonus thanks for sharing.
971028,Gallie,2016-05-25 13:05:00,1215,Great report! Nice fish!
971032,tb4me,2016-05-25 13:15:00,3295,"Thanks folks. We really had a good time. With a feast of Walleye,we caught, yes the dog sure does get a little taste.lol .."

971035,AKRISONER,2016-05-25 14:29:00,5558,"Im guessing about 6lbs on the eye  she could have a fat belly though. Although kawartha eyes are typically skinny. Especially in the spring.  Who knows though, in October my bud caught a 25 inch 8.5lber."

Who knows though, in October my bud caught a 25 inch 8.5lber. Ya for sure that fish in the fall would have been close to 8 pounds..Fish like that are rare for me. I have fished there for7 years now and that was the first over  24 inches for me..I catch a lot of walleye there so we don't go hungry while at camp...lol  When I caught it I had this big old fat creek chub in the minnow bucket. Threw it on a drop shot setup anchored in 11 feet of water..Oh I also found out I  need a bigger and better net...Yikes"
971328,bpsbassman,2016-05-26 23:44:00,941,Excellent!
971351,Rizzo,2016-05-27 01:45:00,4754,"ditto on the 6 lbs, and strangely enough I have seen a big ol crappie caught while trolling for pike. A buddy in my boat did it at 6 mile lake years ago. Nearly ripped its lips off with the hook set but we did land it to our surprise it was a crappie"
971357,NAW,2016-05-27 02:24:00,4022,Great report man!  The crappie pic is great!
971360,GBW,2016-05-27 02:42:00,8460,thanks for sharing and great all around read
971361,crappieperchhunter,2016-05-27 09:43:00,2582,"Excellent report. Thx for sharing. It brought back great memories of getting my daughter out to fish. Something she really enjoyed until she got older and discovered ""boys"" Really liked the photo and story behind the eggs on the ladder too. Looks like you had an awesome couple of weekends."
971376,ehg,2016-05-27 14:28:00,2666,"Wow! Loved the report. Great mix of fish, that walleye and crappie are huge for that area. Your daughter probably had great time just being with you out there! Always like how the dogs stick their noses in fish pics!"
971458,scuro2,2016-05-27 19:52:00,904,Some of my best fishing memories were fishing with my daughter. Thanks for posting and putting a smile on my face.
