971271,jimmer,2016-05-26 19:36:00,2730,This is one of the walleyes that I have tangled with and one of the better sunfish that I tied into this spring. Those are size 11 shoes.  I hate posting pictures on this site. Obviously it wouldn't let me put the sunfish up. 
971273,jimmer,2016-05-26 19:42:00,2730,Here is the sunfish.

971322,Gallie,2016-05-26 23:05:00,1215,Nice fish dude!
971372,ehg,2016-05-27 14:16:00,2666,Back in the day people from Ohio would come up to Pigeon/Sturgeon lakes and load up on walleyes. Now they come up and load up on bluegill/pumpkinseed which are huge in Tri-Lakes. Sunfish are good scrappers on ultra-light fishing gear. Crappies fight like baby sized wet socks. Fun stuff. Thanks for pics!
971378,jimmer,2016-05-27 14:32:00,2730,Caught the sunfish trolling for walleye.
971524,Beans,2016-05-28 01:24:00,3339,"After catching a bunch of 'gills this spring, I was thinking that if they grew to 3 to 4 pounds ,you would really have your hands full bringing them in !"
971634,Dave Bailey,2016-05-29 01:27:00,1641,"Nice bluegill! And they ain't just scrappers on light gear, they feel like fighters on anything. Years ago we were fishing the long reef that extends from the bottom of Chiefs Island on Couchiching, and the sunfish there were as big as dinner plates. Every one felt like a smallmouth fight. Ton o' fun!"
