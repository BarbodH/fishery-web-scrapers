971802,jedimaster,2016-05-30 15:17:00,3472,I prefer this method.  
971936,Garry2Rs,2016-05-31 19:43:00,1425," Dang, you got stuck drinking all that beer alone. Shame bud. LOL  You still running that bass boat you brought up from Yuma Garry? No...The Ranger got sold off when I blew-up it's 150.  Someone showed up, who had cash and a motor, but no boat.. My next goal is to acquire a sailboat and go on a 5000 mile cruise from the Great lakes to the Caribbean and back on the ICW."
971986,ehg,2016-06-01 12:42:00,2666,"Find the Weather Network site a bit irritating with ads/popups etc... Environment Canada is okay. I use Intellicast radar site mostly. Zoom in and out, current local conditions(right side), many options... http://www.intellicast.com/Local/WxMap.aspx"
971657,huzzsaba,2016-05-29 16:16:00,884,"Which one is more accurate?  I am planning to go camping this Thursday/Friday and the weather network says there is 70% chance of rain and weather.gc.ca says 30% chance of rain.   Obviously I understand Canadian weather is unpredictable but from experience, which one do you guys find more accurate?  Thanks"
971659,Terry,2016-05-29 16:33:00,14456,can we vote none of the above  the only good one is AccuWindow  you open your window and see what is happening I wish they were more accurate  on their next day predictions but 5 day forget about it 
971660,Fisherman,2016-05-29 16:39:00,7201,"can we vote none of the above  the only good one is AccuWindow  you open your window and see what is happening I wish they were more accurate  on their next day predictions but 5 day forget about it  Hahaha, X2, wet rock, it's raining, sweaty T shirt, it's hot.  Can't see the rock, it snowed."
971663,captpierre,2016-05-29 17:09:00,2521,"Nobody is very accurate till the day before or better the morning of, IMO."
971669,manitoubass2,2016-05-29 17:38:00,11391,I use wunderground app and its VERY good in comparison.  That and it has more detailed information.  Its not perfect of course but it is useful
971670,Garry2Rs,2016-05-29 17:39:00,1425,"My area had a ""high"" chance of Violent Thunder Showers all weekend. Friends remade plans based on these warnings...So far no clouds, no rain, no thunder, just hot, muggy and dry."

971678,SirCranksalot,2016-05-29 18:11:00,3291,"None of the above!!  Weather network can't even get 'current conds' right!! They also say ""Tue--light rain, 15-20 mm"". OK, which will it be??  WN usually overpredicts the amount of rain. 5 days out they say 20 mm, 3 days they are down to 10, 1 day down to 5, then we get 2-3!! Don't want people getting mad at them I suppose!!"
971680,manitoubass2,2016-05-29 18:13:00,11391,Im tellin yah try wunderground.
971684,muddler,2016-05-29 18:36:00,623,"Yup, Wunderground. I agree with Manitou. Great on the computer and apps work well on Android. It's all I use. The radar is updated every 15 minutes.  No Comparison.  muddler"
971689,manitoubass2,2016-05-29 18:51:00,11391,Yep im not sure how they do it but at least in my area its very accurate for 3-4 days in advance.  And for pricipitation its literally to the minute.  And the radar is awesome as well
971690,Rodbender,2016-05-29 18:57:00,1027,Wunderground and Accuweather for me
971696,bow slayer,2016-05-29 19:09:00,1074,I find Accuweather more correct then either of WN or environment Canada. If I had to chose between EC and WN   I would say EC.
971700,dave524,2016-05-29 19:31:00,4508,"I use Intellicast, look at the radar to the west of us, we can pretty much count on getting whats over Chicago in 24 to 36 hours."
971713,huzzsaba,2016-05-29 20:38:00,884,Wow great information here. I always thought weather canada and weathernetwork would be better than wunderground and accuweather.
971718,huzzsaba,2016-05-29 20:49:00,884,switched apps from environment canada to wunderground and seems like the rain will finish before we arrive the campground.  hopefully it decides to stay that way  .  Wunderground app is pretty nice in comparison and it gives hourly weather days in advance.  Pretty cool.
971720,manitoubass2,2016-05-29 20:52:00,11391,Its crazy accurate man. When it says the rain is coming its right to the minute.  Plus it has the barometric pressure and hourly wind changes etc that I find very useful
971777,woodenboater,2016-05-30 11:59:00,2277,Accuweather.  Intellicast for their radar
971778,Lape0019,2016-05-30 12:24:00,647,Accuweather is what I use when it comes to the fishing season. It seems to be very very good. It hasn't let me down yet.
971781,Headhunter,2016-05-30 12:49:00,5703,"A buddy of mine is a pilot for Air Canada, he uses Intellicast. I have found it to be far more accurate then any others and if you take some time to explore the site, you will find more than enough info to make plans. http://www.intellicast.com/Local/WxMap.aspx?latitude=39&longitude=-97&zoomLevel=4&opacity=1&basemap=0014&layers=0039 HH"
971782,Sinker,2016-05-30 13:18:00,8692,I use intellicast and wunderground  TWN is horrible. They dont even get current weather right.
971783,AKRISONER,2016-05-30 13:44:00,5558,"weathernetworks problem is that they have weather stations now everywhere that can read the current temperature and wind speed in a specific spot. They then label it as a ""pointcast"" where they will give you a forecast for that specific area..but its total Bull because their forecast is actually driven from somewhere totally far away.  I.e. if you look in pointe au baril they have a bunch of local businesses running their ""pointcast"" weather stations...but then you look at their forecast and its from muskoka airport which is down south of huntsville where the weather is typically 100% different than up towards sudbury.  Environment canada has my favourite radar for sure though, especially because theres a station up in Britt which is right near PAB."
971790,Headhunter,2016-05-30 14:14:00,5703,"Akrisoner, here's your Britt info right here! http://www.intellicast.com/Local/Forecast.aspx?location=CAXX1179 HH"
971797,AKRISONER,2016-05-30 14:31:00,5558,does intellicast have preferences so that I can read this in Canadian? lol
971799,DRIFTER_016,2016-05-30 14:50:00,10439,The GC site is always late to the party. You will probably find that in the next couple of days they will up the chance of rain significantly.  I have 4 sites bookmarked that I check to make my decisions on whether I go or not. I will look at all 4 sites and take the consensus as to what the weather is going to be like. This usually works quite well for me. Last Monday I knew what this weekends weather was going to be and it was bang on.  My go to for daily weather is: http://www.theweathernetwork.com/ #2: http://weather.gc.ca/ #3: http://www.accuweather.com/ #4: http://www.yr.no/  A couple more weather related sites I use. http://www.lightningmaps.org/#m=sat;r=0;t=3;s=0;o=0;n=0;  I do a lot of virtual storm chasing.  http://stormtrack.org/community/pages/RadarScope/  http://severestudios.com/
