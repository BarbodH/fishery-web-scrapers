971600,misfish,2016-05-28 18:26:00,29133,"in and out before  the heat got too bad, that's the way it should be  Yup. All sliced and diced, bathing in ice water/sea salt, til fry up. Compared to the fish last weekend, the blood line is much more. There is a big dif between the stockers and naturals, thats for sure. I trimmed very little last weekend. Today was crazy.  Water sure is warming up though. Time for the flippers."
971601,misfish,2016-05-28 18:36:00,29133,"in and out before  the heat got too bad, that's the way it should be  Oh YA, and if the guy that only lived 10 minutes from the launch was earlier, we wouldnt of had to walk 15 minutes to get the truck.LMAO  Atleast we shared the 1/2 hour walk."

971610,misfish,2016-05-28 19:38:00,29133,"You all know I can,t finish the thread with out the candy finish.  Soaked for a few hours in sea salt. Just something I do. I find it gives it a bit more firmness and added flavor. Nibble size along with a few that will be fish on a bun for the mrs,s.    Time to cook away.    Last batch to go and Im thinking, lets add something. Smoke peperika.    Looks like I will be sharing again, as that,s a mess of fried up fish byes. Think I,ll share with me nieghbours again.     Should add, this fish is a great help to my diet. Keeps me away from the bacon wrapped projects. HAHAHAHA.  Not that funny, as I like me bacon wraps."
