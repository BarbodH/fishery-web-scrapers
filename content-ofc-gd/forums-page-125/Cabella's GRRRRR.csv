I know of guys who have replaced them after years of use.  I currently own a pair of LL bean waders with a lifetime warranty as a backup pair.  Bean is amazing with honouring their warranty.  I've heard that cabelas has now gotten extremely tight with their warranties.  Probably due to abuse."

971200,mike rousseau,2016-05-26 10:37:00,4661,First off I'm siding with Cabelas... They are sticking to their warranty plan  Ive had it one time where my GPS was acting up within cabelas warranty but I needed it to finish out my season... They made a note to my file and said send it in whenever your season is finished...  Electronics have different warranties and should be understood by the buyer.... Also this is why I never buy new electronics out of season...  It really sounds like the research wasn't done on this purchase...  It's a lousy situation for you Dara not getting what you thought you were when spending that kind of money... Hope if works out
971206,Dara,2016-05-26 12:18:00,3052,"Its not a warranty policy Mike, its a return policy. 90 days for regular merchandise, 60 for electronics. When I first called them they said I was within the 90 days and to send it back. Half hour later I got a return call saying, woops, you can't return it, we made a mistake, its only 60 days. I think that policy could have easily been adjusted given the initial circumstances, but, whatever.  Its kinda like Harper and his minimum sentences everybody is so happy about Yes, you made a mistake and this isn't how the policy was intended, but there is a minimum by law, so, off to jail"

970987,misfish,2016-05-25 00:01:00,29133,"i guess it depends on your definition of bi box store  A big-box store (also supercenter, superstore, or megastore) is a physically large retail establishment, usually part of a chain. The term sometimes also refers, by extension, to the company that operates the store. The store may sell general dry goods in which case it is a department store, or may be limited to a particular specialty (such establishments are often called ""category killers"") or may also sell groceries, in which case some countries (mostly in Europe) use the term hypermarket.   They are all 4 walls, a ceiling and a floor. Last time I was in BPS and Cabelas, I seen, 4 walls,a ceiling and a floor. Big box stores. Yes?    You are 100% correct hunteronwheels. Sad as it is."
970992,RHK,2016-05-25 00:13:00,15,"The vast majority of  ""Big Box"", Company, Outlet stores don't give a rats ass about you. Generally 30 days then you are dealing with the manufacture yourself. Unless of course you buy their over priced extended warranty program, then its OK, they will happily help you, and all they do is give you another and send the broken unit to the manufacture for the warranty repair. Why is this? Because they have ripped more money out of your pocket. I refuse to buy any large items from these establishments because of this. What this tells me is they don't want to stand behind the product they sell, where as the little guy generally bends over backwards for your business and will do what ever he or she can to help. Future Shop was the worst of the lot and look what happened to them."
971003,ccmtcanada,2016-05-25 03:03:00,7971,That's interesting because mastercraft isn't a company and there is no place in Toronto.  It's a brand...where other companies make products and put the mastercraft name on it.  Lots of people do think it's a manufacturer.

If the Cabelas ad just said Terrova, then it is the basic model and has no GPS automatic controls and the 1200 bucks would seem about the right price.  The I-pilot models are a lot more than that....not sure if this helps but the info seems pretty clear on the Minn Kota site.   The only other option is US2 which is a built in sonar transducer and it is available on all three models of the 55/54."

I thought it had autopilot...a cheap little compass to keep me straight while I set a line or fight a fish alone.  I was thinking of adding I pilot later if use warranted it and I saved more money.  Now, I have the same as I had before except in a 55lb instead of 40.  Its 600 to upgrade to ipilot and the motor was running slow so I'm not sure if I still have issues or a weak battery. I have to cross a border to get my motor back, try it out, then go back for i pilot if it works and pay in US currency Or I can try and sell it and spend 1800 for an 80 lb which I don't need and have to upgrade my wiring to 24 volts which I didn't want to have to do.  And I was thinking a new boat and didn't want to dump a whole bunch into this one if I was upgrading.  All because I didn't read a website properly and for the first time ever bought something like that on line and I am quite depressed about it  And the boat I went and looked at today, the sales guy didn't know what storage length is, couldn't lower the motor so I could measure, didn't know the interest rate for their financing program, didn't know the hull warranty on a freaking Crestliner that he is selling, and after looking in the book of boats tradein value told me 1000.00$ less than the guy in Ottawa a couple weeks ago that showed me the value in the same book...I think I may quit fishing"

My wife bought herself a Ryobi 18V weed whacker last June from Homeless Despot. It doesn't work now. I called the dreaded 1-800 number expecting the worst and I immediately am talking to a nice lady with a southern accent, and not southern East Indian. I'm expecting that she is going to tell me to mail it to Atlanta Ga. or Toronto at the least and asks where I live? She tells me to go to Dave's Small Engine repair in Caledonia 35 minutes from here. I know Dave. Another ""small world"" thing too sort of. Dave said they will most likely give me a new one rather than have him repair it and he doesn't think he can, but has to try first. Rare but great customer service.  Edit: so far so good, hope it stays that way."
971121,porkpie,2016-05-25 20:35:00,2521,"Dara, get your motor replaced via Minnkota, and put aside a few bucks to buy an ipilot head unit for your Terrova when you get a chance.  Yes it's not ideally what you wanted, but sometimes you have to make lemonade.  I guarantee you won't regret paying extra for the ipilot after you used it for a few trips!  A Trolling motor with GPS was without a doubt the best money I've ever spent on my boat."

The advertising by Minn Kota and Cabellas is very misleading and confusing.  Talking to the customer service rep at Minn Kota this morning, he couldn't even tell me what features any motor might have.  Then I got called back frtom an email I sent last week and told the woman that I got ripped off and she just said, yeah thats a bummer  It seams that everybody is out to rip you off nowadays.  I got composted sheep and cattle manure this weekend...its nothing but a bag of half rotten sticks. The black soil is just wet peatmoss. Sure, maybe 1% of the bag is as advertised but the rest is stealing from people thAT DON'Tknow any better.  All the guys that replied saying I am wrong, I thank you for your support and will be very carefull how I spend my money in the future"
970905,Old Ironmaker,2016-05-24 19:04:00,8243,"Not everybody is out there to rip you off. When you deal with the owner of a small retailer he or she will give you the best customer service in most cases than any corporate retailer, not always but usually. The big box guys however are there to answer to the shareholder and maximize that shareholders profit and at all costs. So in that case you are 110% right in that getting ""ripped off"" is in their unwritten business Mantra I bet.  One reason I can not understand why many will buy sight unseen from the Internet is that I want to be able to see what I'm buying before I fork out big bucks, including top soil. Last year I didn't do what I preach and ordered some triple mix without being here before they dumped it. It was more than 50% clay and other crap. Next time I'll be here when they deliver the stuff."
970913,Dara,2016-05-24 19:17:00,3052,Around here they cut the topsoil with sand and it won't hold together when things dry out a bit.  I generally deal local because I believe in supporting local. Living in a border town I see everybody running across the river to spend their money.  The worst are government workers and I just don't understand it..rely on tax dollars for a paycheque and run to a different country to spend it
970971,Mister G,2016-05-24 22:29:00,1429,Sorry to hear some of you boys haven't had good luck on some thing purchased from whoever. At times it really doesn't matter who you purchase the widget from.......it's just a bad widget to begin with.  I must say I have been very lucky when ordering stuff via the internet.........but I do a LOT of research on the product and the seller before I click the BUY button ...... as a matter of fact just Friday I got the bride a spanking new vacuum and saved over $35 having it sent right to the house........more bait money for me ......  LOL
970974,misfish,2016-05-24 22:51:00,29133,"Cabela's is not a Big BOX store in any way...........look around next time you're there and tell me if you see nothing else but 4 walls, floor and ceiling......  BTW I have never had a problem with Cabela's customer service. As a matter of fact I rate them as the best in customer service by far........  I had a pair of leaky waders that were about 6-7 years old and took them in and asked if they stand behind them. They looked up the lowest price they sold for because I didn't have the receipt and gave me that much on a new pair........try that anywhere else.  Minn Kota has quality control issues with their TM............I have had 2 different ones break within a couple of weeks but they did take care of the problem without any additional cost to me.  So my question is first, what do you call a big box store?  My next is your post about waders 6-7 years old and walked in to the store. Which one? Cabelas has been here in Canada, 5 years? First out west,then here in Barrie Ontario the last 2. I dought you got a deal here the north, on 6-7 year old waders.  BTW, I had a pair of waders from BPS some years ago from the Vaughan Store. I made it back just under the 1 year warranty by one month. I got a free replacment. After the one year, I would of got squat from them. So to get a pair even though discounted like you say, I find that hard to beleive, right from the retailer. I know guys with Simms, that have to go through Simms to get repairs or replacements."

I know guys with Simms, that have to go through Simms to get repairs or replacements. 1.)  A big box store is just what you posted......a BIG BOX that is a store........so like a Walmart......Cabela's and Bass Pro to the best of my knowledge have never built a big box that is a store..........both of these companies are built to be destination points for sportsmen and non-sportsmen alike.......they have aquariums, hundreds of game and fish mounts and some even have restaurant(s) within the store. Some even have archery ranges, boats and gunsmiths on site..........where have you ever seen that at any ""Box Store"" you know of.  2.) Yes, the local Cabela's has not been here that long but have you ever heard of mail ordering products......and I agree BPS is not Cabela's and does not have their customer service..........so that's why I no longer deal with BPS but rather Cabela's exclusively."
970977,misfish,2016-05-24 23:22:00,29133,"I would still like to know where you walked in, as you say, you order online, and got 6-7 year old waders replaced ,at a dicounted price? Me thinks you are state side, as you have stated, these stores, Calelas and BPS, are very striked with return/ exchange policies."
970978,Old Ironmaker,2016-05-24 23:31:00,8243,"Wow buddy, you got her her very own vacuum cleaner? A new set of pots and pans for her Xmas present? And I'm supposed to act like it's 1967 because I'm in my 60's."
970985,Terry,2016-05-24 23:47:00,14456,"i guess it depends on your definition of bi box store  A big-box store (also supercenter, superstore, or megastore) is a physically large retail establishment, usually part of a chain. The term sometimes also refers, by extension, to the company that operates the store. The store may sell general dry goods in which case it is a department store, or may be limited to a particular specialty (such establishments are often called ""category killers"") or may also sell groceries, in which case some countries (mostly in Europe) use the term hypermarket."
