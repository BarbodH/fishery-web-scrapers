971278,Joeytier,2016-05-26 20:13:00,3990,Head up around North end of hwy 35 and troll for lakers.
971317,BillM,2016-05-26 22:52:00,17367,Simcoe for whites/lakers.
971333,Rizzo,2016-05-27 00:01:00,4754,I have debated trying Bellwood. Ever give that a shot? Close to home for sure.
971364,KraTToR,2016-05-27 11:35:00,506,"I have debated trying Bellwood. Ever give that a shot? Close to home for sure. Yes, first time was last spring... wasn't too impressed."
971366,davew3,2016-05-27 12:40:00,430,"Bellwood for pike is fun.  Troll or cast off the rocks or at the mouth of the bay across from the boat ramp with mepps or mister twisters.  Troll anywhere around the 15 ft mark.  Other places would be Southampton casting at the mouth or Denny's dam. Trout, salmon.     Or the Detroit River walleye.  The Caledonia dam for walleye. Using minnows for walleye.  You didn't say if you have a boat.  Good luck."

971445,Dutch01,2016-05-27 19:09:00,1431,I fished it once for bass and we did quite well. It's a pretty lake too.
