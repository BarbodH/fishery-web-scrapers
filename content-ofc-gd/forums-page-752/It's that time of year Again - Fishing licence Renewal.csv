413399,Raf,2009-12-19 01:59:00,3495,re: 5 spots  it's an outdoors card.. maybe you can put hunting stickers on it too?
413219,Uncle Buck,2009-12-18 17:19:00,1000,It's that time of year again...  Licences expire Dec 31...  there is always 1 who gets a ticket and then complains...  just renewed mine online for 3 years again...  www.ontario.ca/outdoorscard
413227,Guest gbfisher,2009-12-18 17:52:00,0,regardless of when you purchased it? I'm confused  Yer good if you bought it last year or two years ago and have a three year license.
413228,cuzza,2009-12-18 17:55:00,467,"I just get the option to updtae my details or re-print, nothing about renewal.  Do I have to wait for it to expire? I have a 1 year that I gopt from BPS if that makes a difference."
413238,Dara,2009-12-18 18:30:00,3052,  You gotta go to a dealer and buy a sticker for your outdoors card.   Mine still has another year on it
413239,GBW,2009-12-18 18:34:00,8460,he's just reminding everyone to renew that needs to is how I read it.  I renewed just the other day for 3-years...
413249,dagoat_1,2009-12-18 19:06:00,72,"just renewed fishing + hunting 3yrs and worry free, but it does add up."
413252,cuzza,2009-12-18 19:18:00,467," Thanks Dara, does that mean I can never do online renewals for it?"
413254,MCTFisher9120,2009-12-18 19:21:00,3761,I don't even have a license Buck and I understand what you said completely....o gawd  lol
413257,GBW,2009-12-18 19:28:00,8460,"you can but they call it an ""e-license"" so you have to carry a print out of it as well as your card.  better to just go to a store unless you need a new card as well."
413259,Steel28,2009-12-18 19:34:00,160,Looking for suggestion..  I just completed my hunting course about 2 months ago..went to Licensing office and got my combined fishing and hunting temporary card (they took my fishing card)..they told me my new card should arrive within 2-3 months. on my temporary paper I have both fishing and hunting stickers that expire at the end of this year. Should I just go online and get three year fishing + hunting + card?  thanks
413260,TroutnMuskieHunter,2009-12-18 19:35:00,1362,YA had me worried there for a minute so i checked mine and I'm good to go until Dec 31st 2011
413264,Raf,2009-12-18 19:43:00,3495,make sure you check when your outdoors CARD expires.  no point buying a 3 year license for a card that expires in two or less.
413267,Guest gbfisher,2009-12-18 19:45:00,0,I did say I was confused...........  regardless of when you purchased it through the year if you have a one year license.....
413269,Guest gbfisher,2009-12-18 19:47:00,0, they wont let you get one in that case raf.....I tried.......lol...
413271,Steel28,2009-12-18 19:51:00,160,
413272,Raf,2009-12-18 19:58:00,3495," hey.. you're right!! i just tried too..  but.. if you walk into your local CT, i don't think you'll find that restriction... until that CO pulls you over and spots a valid license with an expired card."
413273,redneck666,2009-12-18 20:27:00,563, i renewed my card online. they sent me a whole new card.... i never carry around a print out and have never been bothered by any of the officers about it that have stopped me.
413274,kickingfrog,2009-12-18 20:34:00,8333,"Thanks for the reminder. Now I'm headed for the basement to check my card, I'll spend the next 2-3 hours down there fiddling with tackle, instead of getting things ready for tomorrow's Christmas brunch. After that, I'll come up for dinner and realize that I got side tracked by all the shiny lures and forgot to check my license, at which point the whole process will repeat itself. Thanks a lot."
413276,GBW,2009-12-18 20:42:00,8460,if your card expired then yes you would get a new card.  If you got a new card in 2009 and a lic. for 1-year and you renew online in 2010 that's when you need the print out.  they don't mail you a sticker.  your card is good for 3-years in total.  I went through that in 2008...
413296,camillj,2009-12-18 22:02:00,1988, Jeeze its good to know I am not the only one ... I was afraid I have ... whats that thing called when you cant remember stuff ... and ... what was I saying ... I know  I went downstairs to get something ... oh well I'll remember as soon as I get back upstairs so at least I dont have alzheimers ... but look at all the tackle I forgot I bought last time I was at LeBaron  :)
413319,vinnimon,2009-12-18 23:01:00,2593,"my card expires next year,and its worn out.Ill renew with card for 3 years.I loose 2bucks but o well.And if there is a problem with renewal that way,I can get a 1year sticker just in case.Just coverin my but."
413330,Anderson,2009-12-18 23:23:00,32,"So here""s something to ponder..... Why is it they have 5 spots for your stickers but the card is only good for three years Hmmm Something fishy for sure I buy my sticker every year .gives them the extra paper work to process Also i never go to the self checkout at CT or WalMart I don""t want to put the girls out of a job So the fat cats can save money??? no sireee Thats not me"
413338,redneck666,2009-12-18 23:38:00,563," okay, i see, i see."
413372,Beans,2009-12-19 00:56:00,3339,"  It is known as ""being in the hereafter"" as in when you walk into a room and ask yourself ""what am I here after?"""
413380,shane,2009-12-19 01:31:00,652,  I'm with you on this one.  I buy all my stickers one year at a time. What if the world does end in 2012?  All those guys that buy a three year sticker this year will be burned for a year.
