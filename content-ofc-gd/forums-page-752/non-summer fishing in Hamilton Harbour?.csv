I was wondering about the other majority of the year. I have got a ton of info off this site already, in terms of locations and species, which is very much appreciated. I had some questions that I have not found answers for as I've looked through the years of posts.  Is there any good non-ice fishing in Hamilton Harbour in the winter for perch and crappie? When does that action usually start?  How late into the year are the pike active, and when do they start up in the spring?  Basically I am looking to expand my number of fishable months in the Hamilton and Niagara area for my species of interest.  Any advice is greatly appreciated!!!"

And Rob D, here's everything I have put together from previous posts that I have fished through  - Pike and panfish seem to be catchable in november in Hamilton Harbour around La Salle Marina, and pike in March as the ice recedes - There is or has been a perch derby in April, so presumably there are perch to be had. Not sure how soon the action starts though.  - someone reported catching perch in the harbour in January, but I assume that is ice fishing and not open water?   That's all the details I got from looking at old Hamilton-related posts on late or early season fishing anyway. I just like to see that people have caught fish at certain times of year. If people are reporting catching a given species in a given month, it at least provides some hope"
