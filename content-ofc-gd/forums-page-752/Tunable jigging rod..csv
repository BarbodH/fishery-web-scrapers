412777,Woodsman,2009-12-17 11:03:00,1286,"Yesterday I bought a new jigging rod at Angling Outfitters near Woodstock that is designed to be tuned to your jig weight for proper action and hook setting. They have them made for them & it is called the Simcoe Specialist. It starts out as a 36"" ultralite rod with 6 guides. The last 4 guides extend in front of where they join the rod and can be used as the last guide. These are 3"" apart. For jigging lures in the 1/2-3/4 oz range you cut off the last 2 sections just after the 4th guide for a total of 6"" off the rod. For heavier lures you can could trim off one more section. For lighter lures you either leave as is or only trim off only the last 3"". Where I plan on using this rod I usually use either a Williams ice jig(J60) or Rapala jigging rap(W7) so I will trim off 6"". Seems like a well made rod for $19.99. I'm now thinking on how I'll use the left over 6"" with 2 guides. I think it will become part of a homemade tip-up."

413313,Woodsman,2009-12-18 22:45:00,1286,"No Rob. The rod as shown is ready for jigs up to around 1/4 oz. For jigs 1/4-1/2 oz cut off one orange section or 3"" total. For jigs 1/2-3/4 oz cut off 2 orange sections or 6"" total. For jigs over 3/4 oz cut off all the orange sections or 9"" total. The above weights are approximate. Start with one more section on the rod than mentioned and try it out. If you find the tip is bending too much, trim off another 3"". You tune the rod for your intended uses."
413322,basskicker09,2009-12-18 23:09:00,144,oh ok so you have to cut it it would be cool if the pieces slide out  what happens if you need the section you already cut off lol
413474,Woodsman,2009-12-19 07:36:00,1286,"The orange sections of the rod are far to thin to be made as a sliding unit. At the thickest it's 0.1"" and at thinnest it's 0.056"". Even the black part of the rod near the handle is only 0.2"" thick. The rod is designed to be tuned to your intended uses. No one rod will be perfect for all situations. This rod can always be changed for a heavier lure weight but yes once the tip/s are gone their truly gone. The benefit of this rod is compared to a regular is that you can fine tune it to your needs. With a regular rod if it is too stiff or too limp your stuck with what you got or at least not a easy adjustment. If you plan on using jigs lighter than 1/8 oz  this rod is not what your looking for. It wouldn't be my choice for jigs much over 1 oz either."

413779,richyb,2009-12-20 04:06:00,774,I dont like the idea of cutting a chunk off a rod. Why not just buy a regular rod that you know how it will feel ?

I like the idea but I usually make my icefishing rods and adjust them to my liking.  The reason I make my own rods is due to the fact that the icefishing rods that were for sale a few years back were never to my liking.  Now, there are quite a few of them."
