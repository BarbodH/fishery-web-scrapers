We headed out last night to check thickness and aside from a couple of open areas, and clear ice spots we are looking at 3-4 inches of good ice.     Marking fish with lots of follows in 12-14 feet of water.  Buck Shot with three minnows caught both fish today...        If you are heading out on the river, please stop into the shop and I will give you more detailed info... BE SAFE... there are a few sketchy spots out there , even in the marina!  Walk the shore line out and stay off spots that look like this!    Remember, if you are unsure of the ice... be safe!  Fish with a friend or let us know at the shop you are heading out!  Don't forget the floater suits and ice picks."
