413677,JohnF,2009-12-19 23:27:00,3494, Does that mean you think he's a fat guy?  JF
413681,Spiel,2009-12-19 23:33:00,9065," Hell no John, more like vertically challenged."
413687,ketchenany,2009-12-19 23:47:00,3229,"If you hear a 'splash, hop' really, really fast; it was too thin . . .  Seriously, don't take any chances, it could kill you, it will get thick eventually. Play safe."
413688,Guest gbfisher,2009-12-19 23:53:00,0,  well..  .my best advice to you is...STAY OFF THE ICE!!!  
413689,JohnF,2009-12-19 23:53:00,3494, Gives the boat a low centre of gravity without even laying down?  JF
413690,TJQ,2009-12-19 23:54:00,7806,  HEY!!!   I'M RIGHT HERE!!!
413691,JohnF,2009-12-19 23:56:00,3494, Oops! Sorry boss.  JF
413693,vinnimon,2009-12-20 00:01:00,2593,
413763,splashhopper,2009-12-20 03:21:00,2931, okaaaayyyyy  but when can i go out and try to catch some at my local lake though? 
413862,JohnF,2009-12-20 15:10:00,3494, When the ice is thick enuf silly.  JF
413876,Beans,2009-12-20 15:33:00,3339,And don't go alone...
413887,ketchenany,2009-12-20 16:00:00,3229,  Take someone you don't like!
413889,moose,2009-12-20 16:04:00,266,if your a big guy like some of us send someone else out to check thickness
413603,splashhopper,2009-12-19 20:05:00,2931,"I am getting anxious to try this ice fishing thing out...  Went out to the local lake where I fished all summer and dang... it's frozen over... with evidence of people walking on it.  I know most of the places where the water will only be 1-2 feet deep at the edges and also know where the drop off begins to the deeper water there as well.   How do i ""SAFELY""  check the thickness of the ice.  Note,  the water is very slow with little to no current except in the very center of the lake ( 20-30 yards out.  Thanks  Splashhopper"
413606,basskicker09,2009-12-19 20:09:00,144,drill test holes or get a spud and stick it through the ice
413607,Terry,2009-12-19 20:11:00,14456,"you put on a floater suit  have ice picks in hand you walk a few feet and chip a hole with a spud, measure thickness then repeat till ice is too thin or you get to where you want to fish oh I like to hit the ice with the spud with each step I take or you wait till a nervy guy does it first"
413608,Guest gbfisher,2009-12-19 20:13:00,0,chip step chip step...till you end up where you want to go.
413609,splashhopper,2009-12-19 20:14:00,2931,  What do I use to chip it with?
413611,vance,2009-12-19 20:24:00,719,If you have a cordless electric drill just pop in an old drill bit and see how far you can drill into the ice-a lot less work than chipping thru the ice.  vance
413613,JohnF,2009-12-19 20:33:00,3494,Get a fat friend to walk ahead of you. You follow and drill holes.  JF
413614,splashhopper,2009-12-19 20:39:00,2931,  Are you busy tomorrow?  I have a drill
413623,GBW,2009-12-19 21:08:00,8460,
413624,irishfield,2009-12-19 21:09:00,26272,Don't let him drill in a circle John !
413626,JohnF,2009-12-19 21:15:00,3494, Hot air makes me deceptively light.  JF
413627,JohnF,2009-12-19 21:17:00,3494,  He'll be hard pressed to keep up just drilling one hole in each spot. I move very very fast on unfamiliar ice. In fact I seldom go out on the ice except on a very fast moving sled.  JF
413629,Twocoda,2009-12-19 21:23:00,4130,  still over your head ....make sure you wear the floater suit
413635,splashhopper,2009-12-19 21:38:00,2931, AS you know John... the little lake I wanna try doesn't have enough room to launch the sled...  No worries though.....  I will follow the tracks that stay above the water out there already
413636,splashhopper,2009-12-19 21:39:00,2931,  They don't make em small enough..... maybe I will take the canoe out there then...  but how am I gonna paddle it?

413648,Guest gbfisher,2009-12-19 22:30:00,0,   A chipper....
413650,splashhopper,2009-12-19 22:37:00,2931, that helped alot
413658,Sinker,2009-12-19 23:04:00,8692,"A chipper/spud is a steel bar with a chisel like end on it used to chip ice. Get one, its the first thing I grab on new ice. Like GB said, chip, step, chip, step. When the spud goes thru on one crack, that's your hole.  Fer gawd sakes, be careful out there!!!! Newbies, on new ice is scary!!!!  S."
413659,basskicker09,2009-12-19 23:04:00,144,attach a big sharp chisel to a long pole with rope round the end so you dont lose it
413664,Spiel,2009-12-19 23:12:00,9065,"Something like this.....      Though I prefer a homemade one using a 1"" cold chisel (sharp enuogh to shave) welded into some heavy pipe."
413671,Sinker,2009-12-19 23:19:00,8692,The heavier and sharper the better. The rope on the end is also VERY important. Don't ask me how I know  S.
413672,TJQ,2009-12-19 23:23:00,7806,"When I go through, its usually about an inch... when I don't its more...    thats how I tell  LOL."
413675,Spiel,2009-12-19 23:25:00,9065,  That's why I always let you go first.
