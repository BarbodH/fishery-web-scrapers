I started fishing when I was about 5 years old( which was quiet a while ago), I fished with my Dad and we fished for just about everything that swam.  As I got older I  float fished more and more and had a lot of fun going to different spots around the Great Lakes.    I got into Fly Fishing and tying flies.  I  fly fished for a while I still like to get out and go for Bass and pike on the fly.  But recently I started to cast lures with a Baitcasting rod. I guess Now I need to find the right boat.  Anybody looking for any fly stuff?  Cheers.."
