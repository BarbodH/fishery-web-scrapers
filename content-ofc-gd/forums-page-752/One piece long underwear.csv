413744,crappieperchhunter,2009-12-20 02:22:00,2582, Krawler I have the under armour shirt only. I would never bother with the full one pc. Under my floater suit the extra warmth on my legs is not needed. The shirt I have is the warmest one they make. Long sleeves that even have a hole for your thumb to go through so it actually covers the back of your hand and partial palm...which I really like cause I fish gloveless. Pricey but it would be replaced IMMEDIATELY if it was ruined or lost....and I am cheap  I do not go out on the ice without wearing this. Some of the best $$$ I have ever spent on outdoor clothing.
413838,marine5068,2009-12-20 14:20:00,26,What BURTLESS said. Polypropylene underwear are by far the best. Don't have to spend $100 for a set either. Buy a two piece set and you'll be glad you did. This way you can wear just the top or just the bottoms if you need them only. Makes them more versatile that way. Look for Misty Mountain ones or another similar good make. Mine were about $30 for the bottoms and $25 for the top. The best for cold weather under-gear by far.
413384,krawler,2009-12-19 01:40:00,167,"Kinda fishing related.  I need to find a few of these as xmas gifts but need one for myself, keeps me extra warm on the ice.  What stores sell them?  I cant seem to find any for sale.  Found one made by HH but dont like the material, looking for that waffle look.  any ideas?  thanks"
413389,misfish,2009-12-19 01:48:00,29133," Whats a waffle look ?  I bought a one piece way back.I dont trust that rear end flap.Like,is it really out of the way?"
413408,krawler,2009-12-19 02:25:00,167,like a waffle shirt or that wafer look.  i dont care for the flap but ive had some rough mornings on the river trying to go number 2 after a morning coffee .... nuff said
413413,bigugli,2009-12-19 02:31:00,6138,They had a stack of red flannels at BPS
413415,misfish,2009-12-19 02:33:00,29133,"Me too.  Man, have a good one before I leave home,but for some reason, when I get to the bush,Im gotz to go again.Thats why I dont wear it no more.LOL"
413425,Vanselena,2009-12-19 02:43:00,269,I've owned a dry suit undergarment for over 20 years and would never part with it.
413436,Radnine,2009-12-19 02:56:00,1538,Have you checked Cabela's website? Jim
413443,Dara,2009-12-19 03:35:00,3052,Try Marks workwearhouse. Thermal underwear...the little pillow/waffles...I think they have em
413454,krawler,2009-12-19 04:05:00,167,"ive checked all local stores online with no luck, will try marksworkwarehouse and bps but they didnt have them on the site  thanks for the help!!!"
413457,Muskieman,2009-12-19 04:12:00,2472,Giant Tiger !!!
413462,tjsa,2009-12-19 04:39:00,1578,"forget the waffle look(nobody sees it anyways), just buy polypro, you will be warm and impressed with it."
413489,spinnerbaitking,2009-12-19 12:29:00,1622,"BPS $22.95 there is a big bin right in side the main door, got a pair for a buddies wife last weekend  , all sizes, hope this helps Richard"
413490,Jen,2009-12-19 12:37:00,833,"and if you really want to be warm buy yourself one made out of fleese... I have one from giant tiger and let me tell you , it not only keeps you warm but it wicks any moisture away from your skin, so if you need to hike to a spot or get a little warm on your walk out to your spot under your float suit you never get cold and clammy...  Oh and it does have the little flap... lol  cheers Jen"
413494,anonymous,2009-12-19 12:52:00,58,"I bought mine either at Walmart or TSC, can't remember which but they were only $15 or so. And it's the old school quilted look you mentioned."
413500,dave524,2009-12-19 13:47:00,4508,"Try TSC,  Tractor Supply Company not The Shopping Channel"
413506,johnnyb,2009-12-19 14:10:00,3413, Not even to wash it?  A couple times a year even??
413540,JohnF,2009-12-19 15:48:00,3494, That's the way to go. They can be pretty pricey but really do the job. I've still got one from my cold water diving days.  Otherwise you can buy thermals at Marks W.W. At least that's where I got mine. I used them under my drysuit in warm water.  JF
413581,Fishnwire,2009-12-19 18:17:00,983,"My brother bought a one piece set by ""Under Armor"" last year...they are not waffled and cost around $100 but he claims they unbelievably warm and worth every penny.  $100 for underwear seems a little high to me, but he keeps insisting I give them a try."
413588,frozen-fire,2009-12-19 18:48:00,542,I got my thermal underwear (shirt and pant) at walmart for my late fall/winter wading.... so far so good. Keeps me warm.
413601,Burtess,2009-12-19 20:00:00,901,"That ""waffle knit"" long underwear is crap (cotton based)..... take a look at the polypro or polyester based undies... these wick moisture away from the body and do not adsorb like cotton.... I have seen the full body at TSC (as others have replied) under the make of Misty Mountain.  Burt"
413649,Steel28,2009-12-19 22:36:00,160, +1 for Under Armor.  Had it for 3 seasons so far. Great buy.
413660,Sinker,2009-12-19 23:07:00,8692,"Yeah, stay away from the cotton stuff.  There is a saying "" in cold weather, cotton kills"". It holds moisture, not wick it away from your skin. The poly pro stuff is great. I haven't tried the under armour gear yet, but I have it on my list to Santa  S."
413663,glen,2009-12-19 23:12:00,2641,I am looking for merino wool top and bottom.  Clam corp makes a set i just have to find out where i can buy it. I have a pair of merino wool socks and they are the best.
413667,Spiel,2009-12-19 23:14:00,9065,"I agree with all who said stay away from cotton/cotton blend (waffle styles), they're useless."
413668,Sinker,2009-12-19 23:15:00,8692,  You can't beat merino wool. Its the best stuff for keeping you warm.......even if its wet. Its all I wear on my hands and feet on the ice.  S.
