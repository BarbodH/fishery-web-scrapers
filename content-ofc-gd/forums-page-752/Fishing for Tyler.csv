411871,Beans,2009-12-14 19:07:00,3339,Sad news for sure Maureen but there are times in life when you have to take care of number one or you will not be any good to take care of others...You have knocked yourself out for this cause and we are all proud of you and I'm sure the others will understand...
411885,aplumma,2009-12-14 20:12:00,6896,I am sorry to  hear that your world is not up to the huge task that you have selfishlessly spearheaded for all of the past seasons. I hope that thinks work out as you need them too to once again in the future carry the torch for such a worth while cause. Until then I am sure that if anyone on the board has a talent that can help you in your hours of need you can call on them for a helping hand.   Art

I wonder if there would be any intrest in trying to do something over here on Sturgeon Lake. I know I could never do anything nearly as well as you do but if I can get some help we might be able to at least do something."
