It's a relief to know the truth after all those conflicting nutritional studies:     1. The Japanese eat very little fat  And suffer fewer heart attacks than Americans.     2. The Mexicans eat a lot of fat  And suffer fewer heart attacks than Americans.     3. The Chinese drink very little red wine  And suffer fewer heart attacks than Americans.     4 The Italians drink a lot of red wine  And suffer fewer heart attacks than Americans.     5. The Germans drink a lot of beers and eat lots of sausages and fats  And suffer fewer heart attacks than Americans.     CONCLUSION.....     Eat and drink what you like. Speaking English is apparently what kills you."
