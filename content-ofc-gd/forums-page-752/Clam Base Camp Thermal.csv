Cabelas wants to charge me a crazy $180 in shipping etc. (before the exchange) - the items is only $280. Yikes! I've check everywhere via the net (Cabelas Canada, Bass Pro, etc). I'm in the Kawarthas so driving across the border is not going to happen.  Any advice would be great.  Thanks  http://www.cabelas.com/cabelas/en/template...&hasJS=true"
413628,irishfield,2009-12-19 21:17:00,26272,"Did you call the BPS in Vaughn?? Pretty sure I saw that thing while Dano was getting his hut back in November.  Or..  http://redrockstore.com/Catalog/index.php?...ion=show_detail  where it's $30 off and the shipping is $70.. so really only $40 !  Drive to Guelph. NIB for $220 (may not be ""thermal"")  http://guelph.kijiji.ca/c-buy-and-sell-oth...QAdIdZ174481720"
413640,Sharkbait22,2009-12-19 22:05:00,297,I emailed the fella in Guelph - no reply yet and like you mentioned I'm not sure if it's thermal.  The Redrock Store is a definate maybe.  Check out http://www.thefinalcost.com/ is you need to know about shipping to Canada.   The guy at Redrock mentioned that website.  Also comparing the Base Camp to the Summit model.  Tight lines and thanks for the leads.
