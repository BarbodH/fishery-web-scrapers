I searched Berkely's website and could only find Atomic Tubes...some pre-rigged thingies.  I sent berkely an email asking if they had discontinued the original Micro tubes...here's the reply   Simon,  Sorry, you are correct it is obsolete.   Regards,  Meechelle Verwey  Customer Service    Pure Fishing Canada    Man that sucks."
