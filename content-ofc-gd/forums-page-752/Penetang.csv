413800,Tdel,2009-12-20 09:11:00,393,"A friend of mine said he saw a person walking from the town dock towards Hindson Marina earlier in the morning on Saturday.  We went down to the dock around 1pm or so, to have a coffee and see if there were any other people on the ice.  Believe it or not there were 3 people who looked like they might be ice fishing out by Hinson Marine with two sleds parked on the ice.  There was another sled running the length of the ice heading north even though there was some open water by Magazine Island.   Not too many brain cells being used out there today.  Tom."
