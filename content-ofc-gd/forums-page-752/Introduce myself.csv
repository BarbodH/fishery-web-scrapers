413151,Rich Clemens,2009-12-18 11:18:00,3131,Welcome to the board Mike.  Been to Smiths Falls a number of times and also passed through Carleton Place a time or two - as recently as this past September.   Actually my father purchased his new Lund several years back from a dealer in Carlton Place.  We do a yearly bass fishing trip to Rideau Ferry so my wife and I are somewhat familiar with your stomping grounds.
413156,TroutnMuskieHunter,2009-12-18 12:20:00,1362,Hey Mike.....glad to see you decided to come over to this site   ....welcome aboard!

413167,mikemicropterus,2009-12-18 14:14:00,22,"das Vergnügen ist alles touche meinig  Rich anytime you are in the area stop by, Big Rideau is one of my favorite lakes to fish.  Cliff I work on everything but I started as a motorcycle mechanic and ended up working for several marine dealers so I have lots of outbaord knowledge(master tech johnson/evinrude and merc certified)  I am also president of a small but humble bass club BAOO, make my own fishing rods and some plastics as well as retailing some fishing tackle and rods so I have plenty of excuses to go fishing, gotta check this new rod or new lure, just made a new color plastic minnow and have to lake test it   the excuses go on and on. It's a wonder how I get any work done at all."

Then I was the only really old fat guy and some guy named Beans had to out do me on both counts, at least I  was the only ""admitted"" small engine mechanic, now I have to share that too? OK Welcome to the board! Where you located Mike?"

413126,FisherMike,2009-12-18 04:27:00,108,Welcome to the board Mike.
413141,mikemicropterus,2009-12-18 06:54:00,22,"Thanks for the welcome.  I am in the Smiths Falls/Carleton Place area specifically Franktown so if you know a courier  Cliff hang on don't want to cause any friction   between us so I'll let you retain the largess title  I have some good tips to keep your motors running properly and save you money on unnecessary service.  If your not going to use it for a couple,2, weeks, run fuel stabilizer, gas these days will go bad, loose octane, in a week, meaning if you use 87 regular fuel, in a week it can loose 2 points on it's octane rating, meaning you will be burning lower grade fuel than the motor requires.  Winter fuel is not the same as summer fuel don't fill your tank in the fall before storage.  I will post in the business section more about my business as it includes more than just small engine repair  And Mike is a great name"
413142,Big Cliff,2009-12-18 09:58:00,6899,"Awh come on and you are an early bird too? Sounds like you have a good sense of humor and enjoy helping others you'll fit right in here!  What product lines do you represent? The shop I work for sells Husqvarna, Echo, Poulan, to name a few. (but we work on just about anything) If you ever need IPLs or anything and I can help, just let me know."
413144,ChrisK,2009-12-18 10:31:00,2772,Welcome aboard Mike.....Nice to see you have finally come out of the closet I'm sure your skills will come in real handy around here...  Cheers !!!
