413177,mikemicropterus,2009-12-18 14:47:00,22,"You guys are making me feel old.  We had a shooting range at my school and from grades 5 to 8 I shot after school.  No one tried to kill anyone in the school, no goth no emo's no jocks, no real cliques and no CELL PHONES,  even though there were some lunnies myself included. If you know what you are you can always spot it in someone else.  Dara to finish the thought, some of the changes they want to make are to eliminate renewal fees and the penalties, misfish is speaking of, they also want to eliminate some redundant jobs, I agree this was a tax grab, I don't agree with the registry for existing long guns unless they are semi-auto capable of easily being modified to fully auto. Unless your hunting man I don't see the need for an automatic weapon.  I know the only press this issue gets is when the police budgets are being discussed and this registry becomes necessary a tool for law enforcement. And we all know some tools are useful some aren't and some in the hands of neophytes can lead to dangerous ends, which is my fear that someone hacks into the database and gets access to all the info or the government of the day uses it for political purposes ie election demographics.  Remember big brother was created during the 30's and is growing in it's power via the fear created by our politicians in their effort to try and convince us they are making legislation to protect us  I'd love to go back in time but the technology we have to-day with respect to fishing is hard to give up. I like my Loomis rods and flippin jigs and would be hard pressed to go back to the fibreglass, closed faced reel and red devils spoons.  They didn't have kevlar so my boat would be alot slower.  I don't mind they crap that goes on to-day but I see the use of the word ""LIKE"" as a staple in the vocabulary of to-days youth as a far more detriment to our society, illiteracy, than a dysfunctonal gun registry.  Conservative governments let us make our own mistakes and then make legistation, liberals just make legislation and then realise they made a mistake."
413268,anonymous,2009-12-18 19:46:00,58,"The problem with the registry, aside from the cost is that it's only usable purpose is to allow easier confiscation. This is what the Toronto Police are doing. They are getting reports of each gun owner in the area who have had their license expire, which does happen for one of several reasons and then going to that persons house and confiscating their firearms. During this confiscation they are also looking for any other offense that they feel they can charge the gun owner with to make a good show in front of the media. Look we just took X number of guns off the street (like they were ever on the street to begin with) and taken away all this armour piercing ammunition (pretty much any jacketted round is evil and armour piercing) and saved countless lives (because this old gun owner is obviously some kind of gangster). They have now ruined some old guy's life, cost him whatever savings he has to fight the charges and done nothing to protect the city from the people who are commiting crimes. All this from the registry. If there was no registry that money could be put towards actually fighting crime and not about taking guns away from some old veteran or deer/duck hunter."
413450,Jonny,2009-12-19 03:51:00,1380,"Bottom line:  FAc's, PAL's, etc. --- good ideas.  Gun registry - a colossal waste of money."
413511,caper,2009-12-19 14:19:00,210,"  Ah....Wrong....  Please get your facts straight. What they are doing in Toronto is going through the handgun registry trying to clean up that mess. And it is a mess...Yes there will be some long guns involved as well but no ""old guys life"" or anyone else's has been ruined. They can either get the licence to be able to keep the guns or have them sold or destroyed or deactivated..Their choice. They are only holding them for safe keeping until the law is complied with. And again this is the handgun registry where the possession licences have expired.  The biggest problem and opposition with the long gun registry as I see it is the fact that non registration of individual fireamrs now makes a criminal out of law abiding gun owners. People like to compare it registering vehicles and such but if you don't register your car and you get caught driving it on the road you aren't risking a criminal record and seizure of all your other cars."
413555,hammercarp,2009-12-19 16:56:00,964," Ah......Excuse me........ Here is what they seized.""Nearly 400 firearms have been pulled off the streets as Toronto Police pursue Project Safe City.""  ""Of those weapons, about 150 were hand guns and about 250 were long guns.""  Almost 2 out of 3 is not some. It is clearly the majority of what was siezed. I am tired of the misinformation. The long gun registry's purpose was to deliberately reduce the number of legitimate gun owners. First by creating such a terrible system that people would turn in their firearms rather than go through all the rigamorole. Then allow  the police to search and seize without a warrant. Then when they have reduced the number of legitimate firearms owners to a politically insignificant number to make it illegal for anyone to own a firearm. The creator of this was Allan Rock and are we lucky that we got rid of that "" little Stalin in waiting"". He made speeches in Europe where he stated that nobody outside of the police or military has a reason to own firearms. Let's talk about the loss of a fundamental right in a free and democratic society and that is your right of protection from the government to search and sieze without a warrant. If you were one of the worst crimminals, like, let's say a child sexual preditor, you would have that right. But because you go duck hunting you are deemed as unworthy of that protection under the law. This part of the legislation alone is an affront to your dignity as a citizen of this country. I am ashamed of our response  or lack of ,to this heinous piece of legislation. The long gun registry has done no one any good. Cars are not guns. No body would leave a firearm worth $30,000+ ""parked"" on the street. This is why we need to register vehicles."
413558,Terry,2009-12-19 17:03:00,14456,  nicely said   it was toted as a way to save lives to cut down on crimes and get illegal guns off the street  the gun registry has never prevented one crime the gun registry has never saved one life and  the gun registry has never got one illegal gun off the street  criminals don't register guns..duh
413563,Dara,2009-12-19 17:12:00,3052,"Caper I think you need to better explain how the handgun registry is a mess in Toronto. There may be a few expired licenses around, but those were all from legitimate owners...not the punks on the streets...so it really is just another waste of police time.  Hammercarp. I agree with you except for one part. you said that they got rid of 400 firearms off the streets of toronto. They weren't on the streets...they were in homes, likely fairly safe as well.  Like they say, fear a government that fears its citizens being armed.  This has nothing to do with safety for anybody except the government.   Hows that for paranoid.   they really gotta think about the laws they make a bit more.  1st..bicycle law for kids..how many kids do you see not wearing helmets. smoking in a vehicle with kids...come on cel phone law while driving...i don't see any difference now..everybody is still driving talking on em...or hands free which is just as dangerous.  These laws all cost millions of dollars to make...why bother spending the money if they aren't going to be enforced.  They would be called idiots for busting a kid with no helmet, but come across an unregistered single shot 22 and they are heroes."
413564,Dara,2009-12-19 17:15:00,3052,  legal owners don't carry their guns on the street...but you know what...there is no law against carrying your 30-06 uncased down young st..or having it in the gun rack in the back window of your pickup truck
413565,caper,2009-12-19 17:27:00,210,"I believe you missed my point. I didn't say there was any effectiveness to the long gun registry, in fact i agree it's a complete waste of money. As i said it makes criminal out of law abiding people.  All of those checks are done on the hangun registry not the long gun registry. Project safe city in Toronto is about visiting people who have hanguns registered to them where they no longer have a possession licence. The misinformation was that these people are getting charged because of licencing issues which is false. There are no warrantless searches and the gun owners are given an opportunity to get their licenceing up to date and they can have the guns back. Not sure where those numbers came from but i can tell you from what I know there are a lot of unlicenced handgun owners out that that need to update their records."

Why all of a sudden such an interest in expired handgun licenses. I hear you that you are not for the registry. Possibly if our politicians actually cared about safety instead of just making a name for themselves, (man do I hate Allen Rock) they would have spent the billion on checking the licenses back then rather than now it could have done some good.  How come nobody is complaining that the job hasn't been done for so many years.   Oh look at me..I'm gonna come up with a new law to make my people safe...instead of using the ones we already have  I'm done with this...its disgusting"

I don't drive a gun on the road...i carry it.  its 2 entirely different things. You are just trying to justify registration by comparing it to a car.  the solution is just license the gun owners..such as was done for years...why push it so far for no rel gain.  Do you really see any gain?
412733,splashhopper,2009-12-17 03:54:00,2931,"I am not trying to justify anything... I just don;t buy the argument that the gun registry, in theory, is a bad thing  What is the solution to the stolen gun problems out there?  Or the import of illegal guns for that matter?  At least there is an attempt at keeping track of the legal ones.   I am gonna sleep on it now.... Maybe I can dream something up for ya.."
412735,Fishnwire,2009-12-17 04:00:00,983," Come on Dara, you're smarter than that.  Of course a gun is inherently dangerous.  Its a gun.  You do understand that their pmiary function is to kill living things, right?  Without question guns are more dangerous than knives.  There are probably a lot more knives in Canada than guns, but which is responsible for more deaths and serious injuries each year?  Would you rather face off an intruder armed with a knife, or a gun?  You come at me with a knife and you're going to have to get close up enough for me to fight back, and I will.  I might still go down, but I'm going to make it messy and noisy and drag it out as long as possible, and it's not going to be as easy as just squeezing a trigger.  If he's not bigger and faster than me I have a chance...you cannot say the same about a gun.  Absolutely guns are dangerous and trying to suggest otherwise is sheer lunacy.  If you don't realize firearms are dangerous, you should probably be prevented from owning them.  Are you telling me they don't teach that guns are dangerous in hunter-safety and PAL classes?  You'd think that would be lesson one.   You're right.  That is needed aswell.  The advantage of also having all guns registered is that forces an increased level of accountability on the owners.  They need to know the whereabouts of their firearms at all times, and that they are safely stored.  No more leaving old guns under the bed at camp or elsewhere for anyone to find or some such behavior.  What about the example given in this thread?  I'm sure he wouldn't have, but if the owner of the lost gun knew it wasn't registered and couldn't be traced back to him, he might not have bothered to report it lost.  The thing is, like I said, owning firearms is a privelegde that most of us can enjoy if we desire.  Being asked to simply register whatever firearms we wish to own, and therefore take responsibilty for, is not asking a lot.  That goes for even ""every little 22 you own"".   You didn't actually address how being asked to register whatever firearms you choose to own is being ""pushed around"" whereas being asked to register your motor vehicles is not."
412736,Dara,2009-12-17 04:13:00,3052,"  I'm noy buying it.  its excessive. the person is dangerous, not the weapon. look at in the UK where guns are illegal. they are all turning to knives now. There are safe storage laws. You can't leave a gun laying around.  how bout some judges enforcing laws that we have. there was a guy up here last year that got busted during a search warrant with a loaded unregistered and him unlicensed pistol under his pillow and some cocaine. He got a $500.00 fine for the cocaine and a $400.00 fine for the gun charges. Show me some enforcement and I will register my guns. my friend mistakenly allowed his license to expire and he had to get me to hold his guns or have the police pick them up till he got it renewed or he would have been charged.  I just don't buy all the junk for honest people. its like 2 sets of rules"
412741,irishfield,2009-12-17 04:27:00,26272,Sure glad that vehicles are registered!   As for what's responsible for more deaths.. knives or guns..   ..and Canada gun crime comes in last.. 
412746,richyb,2009-12-17 04:34:00,774,"How many hunting firearms ( long guns) are used in crime?  how many restricted weapons? ( hand guns, fully auto).  They are 2 different registrations and the long gun registry is a waste of time. I dont near of many bank robbers going in , pulling a scoped 30-06 out of the leg of their pants and holding up the place.  The registration is being scrapped. I have heard that there are 3 voting sessions going on. 2 have already happend and voted to scrap it. All it needs it the 3rd one to vote scrap and its history.  Hunting is one of the safest sports to do. More people likely die playing hockey than get shot while hunting. HUNTERS are educated and respect what a firearm can do."
412748,blarg,2009-12-17 04:41:00,289,"""Some good""  So, the registry folks made it easier to comply with a law and  system that has never done any good, wasted more than a billion, and pandered to soccer moms that simply don't know any better, how excellent, I have dealt with them before, without issue, and that changes...nothing."
412749,Fishnwire,2009-12-17 04:45:00,983," Yes, but as we've proved, knives are less dangerous than guns.  Are you telling me, given the choice, you wouldn't prefer to face someone intent on harming you armed with a knife than a gun?  Of course you would...any clear thinking idividual would feel the same way.  The fact that these people have to ""turn to knives"" proves that efforts are working to keep guns out of the hands of criminals.  Seems like a success story to me.   I understand that.  They are important.  But the point that I'm trying to make which you seem to be ignoring is that If guns are laying around wich are not registered to a particular individual, who is responsible that those safe storage laws are adhered to?  If those laws are not followed and a gun finds it ways into the hands of some kids that are hurt for example, wouldn't it be nice to be able to trace it back to the owner that failed to properly store the weapon?  Without registraton the owner may be able to aviod being determined, or at least possibly be able to deny ownership."
412752,irishfield,2009-12-17 04:48:00,26272," You've proved WHERE. Read the statistics I posted, pre registry full swing, for Canada. Knives account for more than guns.. guns are last for violent crime!.. and I bet a VERY small percentage,, if any, of those were registered."
412757,Bernie,2009-12-17 05:06:00,3190,"Got to agree the registry is a colossal waste of time and money. Criminals that want guns can get them easily unregistered. Handguns have long been required to be registered. Long guns used for sport are used just for that purpose. In non urban areas a larger percentage of people have guns than not. I also have police friends and around here they tell me that they always treat every situation as if there are firearms there anyway. There is no way to know for sure is there? So it's mostly baloney what you are hearing. All the money wasted could have been used for more policing, or healthcare, bet more lives would have been saved doing that."
412759,muskymike,2009-12-17 05:18:00,772," Statistics can be spun whichever way the statistician wants them to be.  So lets try wording this a little different.  There are probably a lot more knives in Canada than guns.  Which is responsible for more deaths?  If someone stabbed someone in the head or shot them in the head? If someone stabbed someone in the chest, or shot them in the chest? and so on...  Just because guns are the weapon of choice for killing people, it does not necessarily mean more deaths are to blame from a gun COMPARED to knives.  It simply means guns are more often used to kill people than knives. They are equally as dangerous put in any given scenario.  Someone could argue that a kid has more of a chance of getting hurt/killed with a knife then with a gun. Only if the child doesnt have access to a gun.  Do you see my point? This wasnt the greatest of arguments."
412772,waterwolf,2009-12-17 06:42:00,556,"a piece o' gum in a dyke mentality. after hunting a property for 3 years the landowner aske me ""what should i do here""? he opened a door to room where he safely stored his hunting rifles .maybe a dozen hand-me-downs. nothing representing arms for a small militia.how many guys were in the same boat , terrified the LAW would come and snatch them off their farms because of uncle ED'S 12 gauge. so many guns will be hidden away and never see an RCMP stamp.   and why should they?       farmers ,land-plot owners and licensed hunters are far from the target group that endangers our society.   billions spent,,       innocent , law abiders shouldn't have to loose family keep-sakes out of fear when criminals enjoy the fruits illegal guns provide  long guns are not the problem."

And when you find out who the kid stole the gun from, what are you going to do about it, put him in jail for 20 years for unsafe storage causing death...they don't even do that for drunk driving causing death. Any decent cop would be able to figure out where the long gun came from anyway.  I would rather face a criminal with a gun in my hands...but my guns aren't for home defense, and they are locked up, so I guess I gotta go at the pistol toting criminal with a baseball bat.

412880,mikemicropterus,2009-12-17 16:30:00,22,"The problem as it was explained to me by an RCMP officer, is in the beginning it was administered by civillians and they had no idea how to set-up the registry and it cost taxpayers billions to get it started. That was under the liberals now the conservatives have given the administration back to the RCMP and they have a strategy to try and make the registry work.  In the past all handguns were registered by and with the RCMP. The registry now is for long guns and being a country with more land than people firearms are a necessity for some landowners. My suggestion was to give a free ipod to each gun owner when they register their weapons. It works in Toronto when they want to get guns off the streets which is where we need our gun owners to live. I always said I need a handgun to walk the streets of ottawa when I was younger to avert the attacks of suicidal terrorist squirrels who used to own the parks when the sun went down.

412644,irishfield,2009-12-17 00:17:00,26272,Exactly Richyb.. is why the requirement for a POL or PAL came into effect before the deadline for the gun registry. Why would anyone obtain a POL if they didn't have a gun in the first place!!! So you comply and get your POL.. but then no guns registered... equals a knock on the door... so you are stuck registering what you have (or a least one or two !   )
412647,PAZE,2009-12-17 00:27:00,132," As far as these people not registering there guns and giving them up, well there just plain lazy, I thought it was going to be a pain in the ass aswell, and its as easy as pie, the people that complain about this registry have nothing else better to do, I dont mind it at all.  Paul"
412651,richyb,2009-12-17 00:50:00,774,"I like the paper sticker I got that im supposed to stick on my .22 because it didnt have a serial number. Also my papers for each gun were just on a sheet of computer paper and i had to cut them out myself and was told i couldnt laminate them.  How much thinking went into it if they cant hand out something a little more permanent like a credit card type card for each gun? There hasnt been a year where i havent hunted in the pissin down rain. A sticker, peice of paper + rain = no good."
412654,richyb,2009-12-17 01:01:00,774,"  You cant register a gun if you have never had a FAC ( now PAL)  for an example.....  lets say someones dad dies and they take his hunting rifle for a keep sake. They are not hunters just want the gun for sentimental value.  Then it comes out they have to register the gun. Not many people are going to go and take the PAL course just so they can have an old gun of their fathers, so they give them up."
412655,misfish,2009-12-17 01:06:00,29133,"Yer all missing my POINT.  They made it easy,and as for a sticker Richy.They sent me one that I put on my old 22 mos.Still on it.   As far as laminating,I have my papers in the original paper sent to me,plus also carry duplicates in my wallet that ARE,laminated.  Never had an issue when I was asked to show proof.   Well said Paul.  Dont let them bust you,think of it as getting your drivers lic renewal. Now theres a bunch of horse crappy.LOL"
412658,Guest gbfisher,2009-12-17 01:10:00,0,I guess its good for something. I lost my rifle during hunting season this season..DONT ASK!!!.... I got it back because of the registry.
412660,Terry,2009-12-17 01:14:00,14456,did they charge you with dangerous storage of a firearm ....LOL
412661,misfish,2009-12-17 01:16:00,29133," IMO,if you are given such a momento,you would be a hunter or shooter even a gun collector.If it means so much to you/them,why not take the course?"
412662,misfish,2009-12-17 01:17:00,29133,"  I believe Andy,will take the 5th.LOL"
412663,richyb,2009-12-17 01:22:00,774,"I agree that its easy to get your pal , or pol renewed . Anyone I know has got their renewal papers a couple months before the expiry date so there shouldnt even be an excuse to have it expire.   Does anyone know when they are going to have the final voting on the whole thing ?"
412669,Fishnwire,2009-12-17 01:44:00,983,"I don't get all bent out of shape because I have to register my car, Jeep, quad, snow-machine, ice-hut, boat, etc with the government...I could never figure out why some gun owners think having to register a deadly weapon in the same way is such a big deal.  Maybe doing so will increase safety, maybe it won't...but why not err on the side of caution?  I understand it is an expense and inconvenience, but for the privileged of being able to own an inherently dangerous item, I don't think it is too much to ask.  I can't help but wonder if all the gun owner advocacy groups like the NRA would have advised its members to just register their rifles in a timely fashion when the registry began, instead of telling them to drag their feet and appose it at every turn, how much better the whole process would have gone and how much money would have been saved."
412682,Dara,2009-12-17 01:57:00,3052,Another non gun owner who doesn't care how the government pushes people around as long as it doesn't affect them.   it would be nice though if other people knew what they were talking about
412686,Dara,2009-12-17 02:06:00,3052,  you got lucky on this one. Good thing the people handling it don't know what they are doing either. POL/PAL's have nothing to do with the gun registry. You were in extreme violation of the law by letting that expire
412687,Fishnwire,2009-12-17 02:10:00,983,"  Having to register your guns is no more being ""pushed around"" than having to register your truck.  Admittedly, I often don't know ""what I'm talking about"" though, so I'll listen with an open mind to you explain to me how the above statement is wrong."
412689,irishfield,2009-12-17 02:11:00,26272,Next we'll be like Wales and England and need a licence for each TV in the house !
412692,Guest gbfisher,2009-12-17 02:15:00,0," If it didnt have a Gun lock on it. Yes, they would have charged me and they said so. I didnt put the rifle in the truck as I didnt get out of the boat and went back out to get more stuff from the cottage. My buddy...  left on the tailgate of the truck and of course didnt make it off Parry island. A good thing. I never thought I'd see it again. Had to report it..  ...Then I got reprimanded by the OPP in Parry Sound as they thought I hadn't reported it.   I did report it in toronto.   The joke was that they wouldnt take the report over the phone and wanted to send someone out to the house to take the report so they didnt make a note that I had called. When the OPP from Parry Sound called I told them I had made a report. Of course they called Toronto and asked. Long story short, the lady on the phone who I talked to in the beginnig said she had talked to me.....SHEEESH.....  I would have been charged with failure to report a lost gun......if she hadnt spoken up...."
412707,Dara,2009-12-17 02:33:00,3052," First off, a gun isn't inherently dangerous, any more than a car or a knife are. You don't need a license to operate a butcher knife, and you don't have to register each one you own.  Second, registering guns has nothing to do with licensing a person to own and handle a gun.  I believe in licensing, PAL/POL This does help keep the nuts from buying guns. if you are mentally unstable, you can't get a gun license. this is a good thing but not the be-all and end-all to safety.  Once you have a license, I can see no good in spending billions more on registering every gun and serial number on them. keep in mind that the registry was brought in well after licensing. If the NRA etc would have advised everybody to register their guns the system would have been so swamped it would have crashed.  Nobody that does not have a PAL/POL is legally allowed to even pick up a gun. You can't even ask to look at one in a gun shop. This brings me to another point. I have personally witnessed 2 MPP's shooting guns and I know darn well that neither of them has the proper licensing. If I would have had a camera at the time........ they were at a gun club and don't even know they were breaking the law. I wasn't sure at the time because i thought that maybe with instructors there it might make them legal. I have since found that even when taking the gun safety course all guns must be disabled to make it legal for students to handle them. If a few people paid attention to this and laid the proper charges, we wouldn't need a registry   rescinding the registry also has nothing to do with licensing. You will still need to get a PAL/POL. You just won't have to tell them about every little 22 you own."
412720,splashhopper,2009-12-17 03:17:00,2931,As a non-hunter.... I don;t understand the beef with having a registry at all..  I have a friend that is a Police officer and he tells me that when they get a domestic disturbance call.. .the FIRST thing they do is check the registry for any registered guns in the house.... At least they are aware of those.   I don;t have any beefs with hunters.... but hey... if you are gonna own guns....lets get em registered too.  We can carp all we want about the feds messing up the registry... but what is the alternative?   No registry ??  I think not.
412722,Dara,2009-12-17 03:27:00,3052,"  You people just don't pay attention do you. Why can't the cop just look and see if the guy has a license. That will pretty much tell him if there are LEGAL guns in the house...why waste another billion to have him know there may be 2 guns in the house   And what cop ever says..well the registry says he doesn't have guns so wer'e cool on this one.  Can you just tell me why, and a real why, not some cops answer, your answer...why is it a good idea to register them when you already have to have a license to even pick one up"
412723,splashhopper,2009-12-17 03:31:00,2931," why the ""you people"" slander  Your argument doesn't make sense to me....if I compare it to having a drivers license.... lots of people have a drivers license but don't own cars"
412724,Dara,2009-12-17 03:32:00,3052,"  so what...what does that have to do with guns?..we are talking guns..not cars  and the ""you people"" is the non gun owners that don't care how the government wastes money as long as it doesn't affect them"
412728,splashhopper,2009-12-17 03:38:00,2931," ummmm....  lets see now.... u don;t want to compare a licencing agency with another licenscing agency..... what's the problem with that?  As a devout ""you people""....i certainly do care about how the gov burns thru cash...... but all i ever hear is how bad and bungled up it is.... but i never hear about a SOLUTION ....  Where I come from... we provide solutions.... and since I don;t own guns, but some of my family does,,, I obviously don;t have the experience to come up with a solution for a gun registry...  But i also don't call gun owner's red necks either..... because not all of them are"
