413175,Mike Pike,2009-12-18 14:44:00,1332,"And Sunday morning at 8am, it goes right past my house.  Cool!"
413185,MCTFisher9120,2009-12-18 15:13:00,3761,"She went through both my towns, Oshawa and Lindsay!"
413191,Dara,2009-12-18 15:35:00,3052,I'm gonna be ripping my hair out by the time that thing gets to BC...Go Canada
413198,irishfield,2009-12-18 15:57:00,26272,"Well Jon... I held it (or one of them) in my hand in the Upper Canada Mall, in Newmarket, yesterday during the lunch hour. Didn't have a huge desire to do so... but considering the lady thrust the darn thing at me I pretty much had to catch it."
413199,ketchenany,2009-12-18 16:04:00,3229,"Will be passing in Kleinburg/Vaughan at 5 this evening and I'm out there.  Irish, you ,  I guess it must have been and old flame!"
413200,irishfield,2009-12-18 16:09:00,26272,"There has to be more than one torch circulating (???) This lady was at the bottom of the escalator in, I wanna say the Bay (2 level store... west end), in Upper Canada Mall all decked out in the Olympic garb. When I left the mall an hour or more later they were saying on the radio how the torch was going to be coming down Yonge St later that evening. But then again the mall is on Yonge St and maybe she needed to get in out of the cold. Newmarket didn't seem to be on the run route, is all, that I saw."
413201,DRIFTER_016,2009-12-18 16:15:00,10439,It went through Yellowknife back a month or so ago. Right past work here.
413204,FLEX ROD,2009-12-18 16:25:00,394,"As it was said, going through Vaughan at 5:13 and ending about 5 min from my house at 5:31 way to cool not to be at the end point.  FLEX"
413232,cuzza,2009-12-18 18:00:00,467,"I'll be out to see it in Oakville tomorrow, supposed to be some canoeists involved as well - they just need to get rid of the sheet of ice on the river first"
413275,jjcanoe,2009-12-18 20:40:00,744,"got stuck behind the torch convoy and all the vehicles on the 401 as they DROVE it from Prescott to Brockville Monday.  Almost caused several accidents since they Expected that all the vehicles would move over tho the left lane (doesn't matter I'm in a speed limited Truck with 70,000lbs of cargo and have 2 or 3 vehicles already passing me in the left lane) when the dozen or so RCMP OPP and Local police pulled onto the hwy with absolutely no regard to the vehicles around them!  You would have thought the Pope was going down the hwy since they needed 12 police cars to escort 1 van with a trailer to the next town!  Don't you remember the good old days back in 1987-88 when they actually ran the torch across Canada instead of driving it?  Go Canada!  jjcanoe"
413277,irishfield,2009-12-18 20:51:00,26272,They sure needed the police on Yonge St. last night !! Country's just full of a holes it seems. I personally have no use for the Olympics since it stopped being an amateur event.. but sure can't condone what went on down town.
413307,camillj,2009-12-18 22:31:00,1988,Wow ... thats quite something Wayne !  Yes I got a note in my mailbox letting us know about the 'rolling road block' ... when I looked at their route online it didnt show us .. then a guy from the city knocks on the door ... anyhow it'll be right out front at abut 10:25 tomorrow .... coffee will be on for anyone who wants to join in  I am a self-admitted Olympic junky .... I always believed I'd get there one day  ... now I think my only hope is for the senior-wannabee-limpics
413356,Musky or Specks,2009-12-19 00:23:00,2710,Im I unpatriotic because I dont care about the rich spending my tax dollars that could be better used. Sorry Ive had it to here with being told how great the olympics are.
