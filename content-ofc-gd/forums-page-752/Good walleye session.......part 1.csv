Its a well known spot with easy access some 20 minutes up the road. there were around ten holes already there (not too hard to re-open ) and i set about drilling around 10 more to cover all the options that spot provides. basically there is a bay in one direction and a narrow channel leading to an open body of the lake in the other.  The holes there already were where it starts to shallow up to the bay, and i drilled holes in the other direction untill i found 18 FOW wwhich is the bottom of the drop off.  Nothing fancy today...just good old jigs and minnows. Got into one right off the bat as so often happens, then nothing for a good 1/2 hour till the light started to fade.  All but one of the fish came out ofthe same hole......holes no more than 5 feet away wouldn't produce. The hole was midway down the drop-off at 14FOW.    MY WALLEYE SESSION THIS EVENING     Might get time to try another spot tomorrow...till then   Tight lines   Simon"

413872,lew,2009-12-20 15:25:00,12766,"I'm not into ice fishing at all Simon, but always enjoy reading your reports from the far north.  Hard to believe were living in the same province though as we have absolutely NO snow down here at all and even the ponds only froze over in the last week or so"

413883,limeyangler,2009-12-20 15:51:00,5204," Thanks Lew,  yeah, having lived most of my life in a country smaller than ontario the distances are still mind boggling for me too."
