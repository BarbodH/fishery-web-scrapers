Any update on the ice condition?  Am heading up to the south shore January 3rd and wondering if the ice will be ready.  2.  I have gone the past 2 years.  The first year I caught 3 walleye and no perch.  Last year I caught 2 walleye and around 60 perch.  All fish were caught with either a plain jig head and minnow, or a drop shot with live minnow.  I can handle not catching too many...I am there for the experience, but this year I am bringing up 2 friends that have never even fished before.  I want to get them excited about it so that we can make it an annual trip.  We are staying in a hut, so we won't be travelling and drilling holes.  Does anyone have any recommendations for catching some more fish?  I picked up some airplane jigs for the magic hour, but am having a hard time finding any tips on the net.  Any help would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks in advance."

413266,Mike01,2009-12-18 19:45:00,378,I usually use a small octopus(dropshot) hook with a live shinner and enough splitshot to get it down on a tip up and a jigging rod with a spoon tipped with a minnow head.  Never seems to let me down.  Which hut operator are you going with?

Or you could go here, click the GL area you want to see.  Only problem is cloudy days, all you see is cottonballs. http://coastwatch.glerl.noaa.gov/modis/region_map.html"
