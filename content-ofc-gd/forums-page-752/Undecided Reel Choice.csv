413217,MCTFisher9120,2009-12-18 17:19:00,3761,"Ok, so like come the Spring Classic at BPS I'll be getting another setup and I just can't seem to make my mind on the friggen reel to buy. It's either a Curado E7 (miester's choice) or for some reason I have a hunch about the Quantum Energy PT. I like both reels and yes the Curado is newer and lighter...I don't know I just want to hear some reasons not to but the Quantum and why to buy it over the Curado and vise/versa  Dam Shimano!   Thank's, MTBF  Hey, I'll throw the Daiwa Fuego in there aswell"
413222,FisherMike,2009-12-18 17:34:00,108,i personally would pick shimano over quantum any day of the week.  i own mostly shimano reels so i may be a little biased but in my opinion shimano is top of the line.  i love my curado's.
413223,uglyfish,2009-12-18 17:35:00,981,no reason not to get the energy... they are great reels.
413224,JohnF,2009-12-18 17:36:00,3494,"That Quantum was my first baitcaster and I've been very happy with it. Perhaps I shouldn't be playing with all the adjustments as much as I do but I like not having to open up the case to set the one brake. I fiddle with that a lot in changing conditions. Perhaps as I get better with it I'll be ok just leaving it off completely. Anyway, I like the Quantum.  JF"
413237,bigbuck,2009-12-18 18:17:00,2449,"I have both, they are both great reels. The Quantum is smoother and I think it casts a bit farther but that's not really fair, different rods/lures. Put both in your hands see which you like better and if that does not work, flip a coin, you can't go wrong with either."
413241,Bernie66,2009-12-18 18:43:00,123,They are phasing out the last generation Fuegos right now. Check out www.tacklewarehouse.com I think its going for around $130 US.  That is a great deal for a reel of that calibre.
413251,solopaddler,2009-12-18 19:14:00,8605,If you're a lefty I know where you can get a smokin' deal on a Quantum tour edition pt (TE101SPT). $175 tax in.
413253,aniceguy,2009-12-18 19:20:00,1094,"Mike it depends on what you want to sue the reel for,  but I would stay away from the quantum with a push pole, get the shimano its well worth it..."
413261,hirk,2009-12-18 19:37:00,571,"How's this for an idea Mike,get a Revo SX,cheaper than a 200e7 and imho a better reel (an thats saying ALOT) even though the Curado's are very slick.Take the Quantum and toss it out window of this debate"
413291,uglyfish,2009-12-18 21:50:00,981,"is there really a point to asking for an opinion on what reel?? the same thing always happens, u get the guys who use shimano say buy the curado... the guys who use quantum say, buy the energy... both guys say the other reel is not as good. and then u get the odd guy saying to buy somethin different like abu or daiwa.  i use quantum reels... however, i own 2 citica reels and love them, but i like my quantum reels better. personally, i think the energy looks better then the curado, and is a bit smoother as someone else pointed out as well. both reels were made smaller and lighter this year.  so, best advice... decide on the technique ur gonna use the combo for.. then pick out the rod u wanna match the reel with first... now, based on the technique, decide on the gear ratio u'll need... cranking, high speed, or burner... now, take that rod and go to the counter and ask to see one curado and one energy and then put each on the rod, and get a feel for them, look how they match up and balance on the rod. then decide what one YOU want to get based on how each reel feels to YOU and what one will best suit YOUR needs."
413302,mbac31,2009-12-18 22:20:00,904,"You first need to find a use for the reel you want to but. General good all around reel would be a 6 speed. If you are looking for speed then the faster 7 speed reels are better for that. All 4 reels have their place. Daiwa Fuego's right now for the price cant be beat and are very smooth reels. The Curado is by no way as smooth as the Abu,PT, or the Fuego bit does palm nicely and has a very nice pickup recovery. Great Froggin reel and good for you reaction type baits. However you will have to grease the Abu and Curado more than the PT and Fuego. Tolerences on the Abu are not as good as the Quantum and Daiwa. On a scale of 1-4 I would rate the reels as this. 1:Quantum PT 2:Daiwa Fuego 3:Abu Revo 4:Shimano Curado This is just based on smoothness of the reels. However with a little cleaning and grease swap and a little polishing of the roughly cut gears the Curado and Abu  will turn out very smooth. Tends to get dirty very easily. For size it would be a toss up between the Curado and the Fuego. The Quantum is still a bigger reel but will feel Like an older Calais for smoothness. It actually feels like you have a solid peice of machinery in your hands. Dont buy one for lightness as some reels being light as they are do not balance on the rod very nice. Tends to give you a tired forearm and a nervous shoulder after a long day of casting. I personally like a heaviey reel on a rod that I even weight sometimes for balance. You can have a rod/reel combo that if weighed will scare you but you can fish all day without fatigue.  First pick a technique you want to use this for and I'm sure someone can better answer your question. Bass Pro and Hirks in Bomanville, Fishing World has some great deals on right now for sure. Hirks has been selling the revo for a fantastic deal. Bass Pro gnerally is higher than all others but you get to see stuffed animals. Lol. and Fishingworld will give you great deals. Better to buy in a smaller store to get better service usually. Just my opinion, not stirring the pot"
413311,Greencoachdog,2009-12-18 22:37:00,8163,"I think you need to throw the Diawa in the garbage... forget about the Quantum and Shimano... and get the oversized Zebco 33... it is soooo you!!!  They're all good reels Mike (except the Zebco), get the one that feels best in your hand and you have the most confidence in.. that'll be the best one for you!"
413337,BillM,2009-12-18 23:36:00,17367,"Mike, you buy a lot of reels man"
413342,Hellfish,2009-12-18 23:51:00,308,"In my experiences if your looking to target pike and musky maybe salmon, I would consider the Curado. Now if your looking at using it for bass or similar I probably would go with the quantum. I love throwing soft plastics with my energy but hate throwing bigger baits with it. Also I like the drag alot better with the Shimano much smoother but like the ease of the breaking system with Quantum, kind of a catch 22. My next reel will be the new Stradic CI4 for bottom bouncing for steelhead in the Niagara, smooth as a babys bottom!"
413348,MCTFisher9120,2009-12-19 00:08:00,3761," Ahahaha lol, I know eh, well I followed through and got that R-Type combo, more than a citica which is what i wanted. the 2nd good setup is on it's way, hopefully something goes on sale"
413352,BillM,2009-12-19 00:14:00,17367,You should be able to find some decent deals during the holidays..  The worst part is seeing all that new hardware sit for months until the hardwater season is over!
413353,MCTFisher9120,2009-12-19 00:15:00,3761," Shh, I might bring the R-type setup out onto the Ice while the action is slow and throw a sinker around..."
413357,Whitespinnerbait,2009-12-19 00:27:00,2038,Remember this Mike................Shimano = Superior Quality
413359,basskicker09,2009-12-19 00:28:00,144,all those reels are crap and over priced get a rattle reel from walmart they are 1 buck and they last for ever lol  i would not go by anyone elses advice or you may regret it just go out shopping with an open mind and just test the reels and see how they feel just my two cents
413360,salmon,2009-12-19 00:32:00,334,"Mike I have had my fair share of several good reels before:  Calais 100 Calais 200 Calais 200DC Daiwa Steez Daiwa TDZ Daiwa Fuego Shimano Core100  I have sold them all and now I only have the Curados left. For the price the curado cannot be beat. Great for throwing senkos, spinnerbaits and 3/4 oz cleos.  I will restock this coming season with Curados and Core 50's only.  Jose"
413364,BillM,2009-12-19 00:37:00,17367,"Jose, I am still in love with the Calais I purchased from you   God what an awesome reel...."
