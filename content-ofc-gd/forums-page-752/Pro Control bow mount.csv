413460,Bob Devine,2009-12-19 04:22:00,251,Here is a new idea for the guy who has a transom mount electric motor and would like to use it as a bowmount or foot control. I have heard rumours that they MAY be making their way into Ont in 2010. Not sure on the price point but would give an angler another option. http://www.procontroll.com/
