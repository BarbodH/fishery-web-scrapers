412981,Terry,2009-12-17 21:40:00,14456,that's after the liquid dries out isn't it
412984,Jet,2009-12-17 22:00:00,364,"That's what makes them good for the environment, Gulps are biodegradable! It happened to me too with an old pack of minnows."
412996,FSNmachine,2009-12-17 22:37:00,22,Mine are good from last winter yet.
412997,frozen-fire,2009-12-17 22:39:00,542,"Agreed...they are completely biodegradable...great stuff. The mould must've happened due to the container drying out. I've never experienced mould myself, but the plastic becomes rock hard"
