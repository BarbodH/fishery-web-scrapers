We only had a few hours but we made the best of it.  We started off flipping banks in the river but after only a couple 2 pounders, we pulled out to fish the deeper waters of the main bay.  Glad we did!  Started off chucking a Rapala DT16 and finally hooked up with a 2.5 pounder after a solid hour of chuckin and windin.  After I hooked that fish, I tossed a buoy and we worked that area hard with Chigger Craws and Texas Rigged Tubes.  We managed 7 fish in the hour an a half we spent in the main bay, ranging from 2-4 pounds, even got a high 3 on camera.  Off the water by 10:30...

492358,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-08-08 00:37:00,0,Very nice. Today we had some prime fishing weather. Cooks bay is the closest fishing spot to Toronto and no one hardly fishes it anymore. There's some good bass fishing to be had.  You guys should have joined that guys and gals tournament.
