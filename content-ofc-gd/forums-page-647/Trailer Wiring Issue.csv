I'm not very good with electrical, so I don't know what could be the problem. I'll try to explain exactly whats going on...  With my running lights OFF, everything works fine - brake lights, left and right signal.  With my running lights ON, right away my right hand light is brighter then the left (almost seems as if its stuck on). My left hand signal lights and brake light are fine. But since the right is ""stuck on"" it does not change.  I hope I explained this so at least someone can understand. I'm thinking its a short, or bad ground...  Thanks guys"
492549,Terry,2010-08-08 16:52:00,14456,92% chance it is a grounding problem
492561,vinnimon,2010-08-08 17:09:00,2593,"As terry said,if you have an 1157 bulb in the socket.Check the spring,metal tips in the socket as well as ground.Sily question?Is there an 1156 bulb in the socket?"
492566,LucG,2010-08-08 17:15:00,779, The bulbs are brand new 1157s.
492570,vinnimon,2010-08-08 17:22:00,2593,"  Check the spring tension in the socket!,and there will be two tabs,they should be sticking out a bit!If thats okay,trace the grnd wire back to its connection,look for corrosion! Hard to say without seeing what you have.Question,does your turn signal in the car flicker with this problem?"
492578,Fisherman,2010-08-08 17:47:00,7201,X2 and then some.
492580,vinnimon,2010-08-08 17:59:00,2593,"  Then your going  to find it, one after another!"
