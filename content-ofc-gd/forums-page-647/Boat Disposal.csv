491638,Banger68,2010-08-05 17:27:00,157,I have an old 19' Sangstercraft that the interior got screwed up. I was trying to give it away to somebody as a project to no avail. Where would I scrap something like this?
491640,danbouck,2010-08-05 17:30:00,4380,Is it aluminum?
491644,Banger68,2010-08-05 17:33:00,157,"Guess that would help. It's fiberglass, sort of cuddy cabin style."
491647,danbouck,2010-08-05 17:45:00,4380,Check a local scrap yard and ask if they will take it. Otherwise
491675,pikeguy,2010-08-05 19:26:00,195,"around here(Sudbury) they bring it to the dump, then the recycling center takes it.   When i was in high school we had a body shop and somebody gave us a boat to work on for practice"
491683,Uncle Buck,2010-08-05 19:39:00,1000,it'll cost you to scrap it...  Cost me $50 for my old 16' trihull  4 years back...
491707,bbog,2010-08-05 20:39:00,665,"Have you tried listing it in the ""free"" section of kijiji? Worth a try before landfill and could save you a few bucks (disposal fee)."
491733,Muskieman,2010-08-05 22:09:00,2472,"if it floats.. take her to a marina and leave it moored 'til someone steals or scudlles it......I know it's been done before.  Or do as I did with an old bike ... put it on the sidewalk with a ""FREE"" sign on it... 15 minutes and it will be gone.! RFS "
491850,Banger68,2010-08-06 02:14:00,157,"I tried the Kijiji ... no takers. She floats ... just nothing to sit on, including no floor.  Might aswell try again."
491852,vinnimon,2010-08-06 02:19:00,2593,"I had the same thing happen,but I lucked out at work with a huge dumpster.I cut upthe boat(17 ft fiberglass),in the can it went.The trailer no takers,got 50 bcks srap for it.It was shot!"
491870,HTHM,2010-08-06 03:31:00,4082,Skuttle it and make your own private bass hotspot
491892,Fish Farmer,2010-08-06 12:14:00,2234," I'm with vinnimon Get out the Saws-all, cut it up in small pieces. Take to the dump. They charge here in Hamilton buy the kilo. one other suggestion, call your local fire dept. ask if they would like a practice boat. Just a thought. Good luck Bud"
491907,Billy Bob,2010-08-06 13:20:00,5865,Take all ID's off the vessel and dump it in the middle of the street...then call the police and say  it fell off a truck...
491946,craigdritchie,2010-08-06 15:02:00,1586,Sandy Cove Marine Recyclers in Honey Harbour recycles fibreglass boats. Not sure what happens to the glass once it goes through the shredder .... I think it becomes park benches or playground equipment.
491948,Roy,2010-08-06 15:07:00,13728," NAHHHH ... I think they make Bayliners out of those, Craig.  If there's anything left, they send it to Fenwick."
491954,craigdritchie,2010-08-06 15:13:00,1586,D'oh!!
491956,SudburyAngler,2010-08-06 15:14:00,154,"LOL, thats a slap in the face to the guy driving his bayliner at high speeds in front of my fishing spot."
491966,misfish,2010-08-06 15:46:00,29133,"Just dont drop it off at your local movie parking lot.  Yes it,s true.   I took mine to the dump here.Just backed up and pushed it off."
492177,Banger68,2010-08-07 01:53:00,157,I heard that they what $200 to recycle it.
