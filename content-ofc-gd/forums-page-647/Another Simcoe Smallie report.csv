Turned out to be another great day of action with 10 quality SMB's being landed. I set a personal best early in the day with a 5 lb 8 oz SMB, and within the hour had another PB at 6 lb 4 oz. (Photo attached).  The lures of choice today we're live and gulp leeches, wacky worms, and cranks.  Cheers! "

492414,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-08-08 02:59:00,0,Very Impressive! Simcoe is a bass factory for sure! Its been awhile since I have targeted Simcoe smallies.Next year when my bro gets the boat I will hopefully be targeting Simcoe bass again! They are great fighters and fight till the end! I bet you had to revive the big one!
