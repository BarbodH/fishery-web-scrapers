He wants to replace it Now what kind of thrust should he be looking for ? 12V/24V/36V?   Thanks for the help in advance!!   Randy "

492508,SlowPoke,2010-08-08 14:58:00,2984,"Cable or electric steer should be the first question, then determine shaft length, then find out if you have room for three batteries. If it were my boat (providing it had room for the batts), I'd pick a 36v 101 lb Terrova with iPilot and 60"" shaft."
492511,SlowPoke,2010-08-08 15:00:00,2984,"It's a 42"" shaft, not likely long enough for a bowrider.... more for a bass boat."
492589,Ron,2010-08-08 18:16:00,1683,This one would be perfect for this boat too. Listed in the classifieds
