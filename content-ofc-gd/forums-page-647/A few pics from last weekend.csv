Last weekend I decided to try a new area of the St. Lawrence and found some promising spots.  Snapped a few pics while we were out, nothing to write home to mom about but the Mrs. finally had a decent catch from the boat and broke a terrible catchless streak so she was really happy about that and that seems to have given her a bit of an itch to get back out there.  Anywho, the pics...        Hrmm, gonna have to add a reply, how do you guys get around the 250Kb limit??"

You can put as many pics as you like in your posts, and at the size that you want. I resize mine first before uploading down to 800x600 pixels (I use a program called FastStone Photo Resizer, but you can do it with pretty much any image editing software) Upload to Photobucket, then copy the link and paste it into your report. The link will start with ."
