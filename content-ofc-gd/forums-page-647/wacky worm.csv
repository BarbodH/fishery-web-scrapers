492472,Radnine,2010-08-08 13:20:00,1538,"    Do the ""O"" ring thing when wacky rigging and your Senkos will last forever. Also, try YUM Dingers as they are only between $4.99 and $6.99 a bag ($10/bag? Ouch man!) Jim"
492484,jbailey,2010-08-08 13:53:00,866," yea its insane, bass pro charges 9.99 for a bag of pink yamamotos -- i couldnt believe it so I've been buyin the YUM Dingers"
492541,ckrb2007,2010-08-08 16:26:00,449,"Definately bubblegum. This past weekend I tried some 5"" Wicked-Stix Inferno colour (kinda dark orange/red with a lighter orange swirled in) made my NorthAMfishing Tackle CO. Bought them at Tromblys Tackle Box up in Orillia. I gotta say that they worked great producing just as much as the pink senkos. From what the guy at Tromblys said, they're locally made which is great. Still a little pricey at $7.99/bag though."
491696,Lunatic,2010-08-05 20:23:00,536,hey all im going on my trip up north for a few days tomorrow morning and have been really wanting to give wacky worm more of a try this time around. ive tried it a few times with hit n miss results. i'll be hitting bass pro shops on the way up and would like to add one or 2 more senkos to my tackle. so question is what works for you most of the time?
491701,jbailey,2010-08-05 20:34:00,866,"i find bubble gum pink or watermelon green with red flakes works well, i've also heard grey/black works well but i've never tried it"
491703,Toddyc20,2010-08-05 20:35:00,141,"You may think i'm crazy but the most productive colour i've used in most water conditions has been hot pink.  I bought them one time because I let my wife pick out one pack of worms and well what can I say, she has great taste."
491708,alexcba,2010-08-05 20:40:00,634,"as both of the gentleman before me have posted. my most productive is pink, second place goes to white with silver flakes."
491717,BillM,2010-08-05 21:24:00,17367,"I like the black with red spec 7inch Senkos and watermelon as well.  I've never noticed one work better then the other though, if you put it infront of a fishes face, it's either going to eat it or not."
491736,chong,2010-08-05 22:20:00,102,"I use watermelon/white laminate ,brown/black flakes,pumpkin/green flakes."
491739,ctranter,2010-08-05 22:24:00,543,Dark Green with gold specs works wonders in my lake.  Never tried the bright pink but I'll have to give them a shot.
491740,EC1,2010-08-05 22:28:00,930,"Black w/ mystery flakes, Smoke w/ blue and gold flakes, and Pink.  I don't know why I don't seem to like watermelon that much, but I also have yet to have found a colour the largemouth refuse to eat though."
491746,JohnF,2010-08-05 23:06:00,3494,"Pink, hands down.  JF"
491755,stubbex1,2010-08-05 23:19:00,164,pink hands down
491801,gonduckin,2010-08-06 01:00:00,19,Pink
491829,BillsTheBassMan,2010-08-06 01:33:00,932,"All I know is that they have been underperforming for me this season - but I only have GreenX worms - watermelon, green pumpkin etc.  Next time I'm in the mood to try some, I'll be expanding my colours.  The greens used to work best for me, now they've died down a little."
491831,Paully,2010-08-06 01:36:00,712,Pink will always catch you at least one fish..
491840,Guest JPCT,2010-08-06 01:46:00,0,First cast with a Green Pumpkinseed netted me a Pike.  First cast with Pink netted me a nice 5lb smallie.   Those are my 2 faves

491854,Lunatic,2010-08-06 02:24:00,536,"awesome thanks guys. i've been pondering pink for a month or two now, and this seals it. gonna pick up pink for sure."
491861,4x4bassin,2010-08-06 02:44:00,1025,Red shad or Bubble Gum
491862,danbouck,2010-08-06 02:47:00,4380,A wise man once told me to use natural colors. So that's what I do!
491950,Sketty55,2010-08-06 15:08:00,52,"Green pumpkin for me works best in the Kawarthas. However, two years ago I was in bancroft and the only colour they would bit on was bright yellow."
492288,Garry2Rs,2010-08-07 18:23:00,1425,"I carry a lot of natural colours because one never knows what will do the trick! However, fishing theory says that the bait, crayfish, minnows etc, will camouflage to match their surroundings...Therefore I always have a lot of brown to Rootbeer shades and a lot of greens in my boat.  I will have to give pink worms a try! I had great success with pink Flukes, but always thought that it had to do with the fact that I could see them better and so fished them with more finesse..."
492376,cwpowell,2010-08-08 01:11:00,265,"Tried a senko the other day with a couple of my buddies. Never tried one before this one happened to be bright pink and I was slammin them, throwing them out there and letting it drop would always get slammed before I hit the bottom, only problem I noticed with them is they get destroyed fast, and for 9 bucks a pack, that kind of sucks!"
492379,ctranter,2010-08-08 01:15:00,543,"  This is very true.  When wacky rigged, a bass that takes either end of the worm can lead to destroying the plastic.  Most of my broken senkos come from bass that bite the worm and battle it to the surface without a hook set.  If nothing else this proves their attractiveness but I agree 10$ a bag is a tad extreme."
492413,The Urban Fisherman,2010-08-08 02:54:00,2050,"First off I love Berkley's Heavy Weight sink worms.... there's no doubt that senko's catch a wack of fish, and they were my go-to worms for a while but berkley's version casts just as far, has just as good or better action, and they are a HECK of a lot more durable!  The thing i hate about Senko's is they fall apart after 1 good bite...  Colors -  White Greens Black  Pink Senko's do work great for those of you considering giving pink a shot...  Cheers, Ryan"
492416,PERCHER,2010-08-08 03:07:00,787,pink pink pink then watermelon
492451,singingdog,2010-08-08 11:38:00,1047,"My best presentation for big smallies is wacky-jigging. Here's 2 recent ones:    90% of the time I am throwing dark green or brown.  I have caught up to 20 smallies, but more typically 7-8, on the same senko by using either an O-ring, or by putting a thin band of shrink-wrap tubing on the middle of the senko and hooking through the shrink wrap. Orings and a circle hook will normally get you 4-5 fish/senko."
