492179,tybrad,2010-08-07 01:56:00,45,"Hey hey, just came back from a few hours on the Conestoga after work. I've been learning the river and how to river fish and managed to catch my personal largest smallie and ALMOST land one even bigger... it was swimming around my legs and got loose just as i went to grab it. Ah well, I am really happy to find some fun fighting fish so close to me!    "
492186,bulltron,2010-08-07 02:14:00,88," nice little dude there ... and yeah, local fishing is quite a bit easier on the gas tank than travel fishing[even in my TDI:(]"
492188,tybrad,2010-08-07 02:22:00,45,tdi's def. are nice. It's all i've ever driven
492205,Mike Pike,2010-08-07 03:55:00,1332,A beautiful river.  Glad you had some success on it.  Now go get that bigger one that got away!
492269,whynotalen,2010-08-07 16:50:00,33,"Hey Tybrad. were ya flyfishing ? If not, what lures were ya using in the conestoga if you don't mind me asking?"
492290,tybrad,2010-08-07 18:33:00,45,"just spincasting, i was using an inline spinner and topwater and both were producing here and there, I havent really done it enough to find a pattern or trend quite yet"
492317,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-08-07 20:48:00,0,"Congrats on your PB.Sounds like a nice little spot. If its rocky try pumpkinseed tubes and if its weedy, try 4 inch senkos texas rigged!"
492411,jediangler,2010-08-08 02:47:00,1923,"Well done tybrad, now you'll have to try the Speed river and the Nith river. I know you've already fished the Grand. We do live in an excellent location for river fishing. Keep the reports coming."
492521,[emailÂ protected],2010-08-08 15:16:00,25,Just to clarify are you fishing the Conestoga R or the Conestogo R?
492536,tybrad,2010-08-08 16:14:00,45,"I messed it up. There is no conestoga river rather conestoga lake, and conestogo river"
