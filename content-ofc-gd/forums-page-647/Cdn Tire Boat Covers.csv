It also has a great warranty... 4 years if I am not mistaken? Mine wore thru earlier this year (3 years old) from rubbing on one spot on the boat, I took it in with receipt and they handed me a new one! When it is $100 off, you can't beat it for the price in my opinion..."
492176,zeeter,2010-08-07 01:53:00,92,"It depends on what type of boat you have and how much you want to spend.  I looked around for a trailerable cover for my 167 Princecraft and ended up ordering a custom cover through boatcovers.com. Fits perfect and is reinforced in the right spots.  Paid $450 for it which is reasonable considering the cost of most custom covers, but that's still a bit of money to fork out.  I was looking for a custom cover because I had tried other generic covers and they didn't fit too well.  If you get a generic cover make sure it fits tight enough otherwise you'll have problems on the highway."
