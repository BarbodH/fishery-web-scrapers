492048,Hooked,2010-08-06 20:16:00,891,"Problem I have is, and always had with it, is the suction cup for my portable transducer keeps coming off.  I recall sometime ago someone posted there specially rigged portable transducer, using a clamp and stick....anyone here have such a setup for their portable transducer?"
492051,alexcba,2010-08-06 20:21:00,634,"i dont really have any problems with mine. i used to tho, so what i do now is the following.  -look down on the back of the boat and find a place under the water that it nice and flat, no rivets, or breaks on the surface.  -get an abrasive rag and wipe down the area you are mounting it to.  -place the cup on it, and press down hard to get all the air out.  unless im going full speed for more than 5 mins it does not come off.  hope that works for ya."
492092,Raf,2010-08-06 22:12:00,3495,"for an out of the box solution, tite-lok makes a portable ducer holder that clamps to your boat.  you can fab something up from a c-clamp and a hockey stick."
492101,DRIFTER_016,2010-08-06 22:32:00,10439,"The fastest and cheapest way to fix them is to unscrew the suction cup and put it away in a drawer.  Next cut your self a 24""-30"" piece off an old hockey stick shaft (wood).  Screw the transducer bracket to one end of the hockey stick. Buy a 4"" C-Clamp at Canadian Tire.  Clamp stick to back of boat with clamp.  Go fishing!!    PS a decent 1""X4"" will work in a pinch."
492160,adempsey,2010-08-07 01:20:00,1498,I have a Tite-Lok system and I have to say I probably should have gone with the hockey stick/C-clamp.  Not worth it IMO.
492173,Fisherpete,2010-08-07 01:47:00,1814,"On my old boat, after losing two suction-cup transducers, I  rigged up a home-made c-clamp/wood version. When I picked up my new ride last week, I dished out the $40 for the Tite-Lok one... it looks quite a bit nicer and you can adjust the height of the transducer easily if need be. (I did on my first trip out - the transducer was set a bit low and was kicking up a rooster tail behind the boat) I got it at BPS. Looks like this...    I did have to customize it a bit to fit my Humminbird transducer, just drilled a couple holes and used some longer bolts than the ones that came in the kit. Took 10 minutes all said and done."
