491242,OhioFisherman,2010-08-04 13:42:00,6623,Well he wanted to be famous? now he is! It`s not if you win or lose? it`s how you play the game?
491252,LucG,2010-08-04 14:27:00,779,"He's lucky he didn't get charged. Last time I read of someone stuffing lead weights, they were charged with fraud over $50,000 due to the fact that first place prize was a bass boat."
491265,bassman,2010-08-04 15:06:00,384,"I'm sure cheating happens more than we think.  I bet the rule below gets broken regularly:  HORSEPOWER: Maximum horsepower for all outboards and inboards must not exceed the limitations that are set by the manufacturers rating plate. Changing or altering standard factory parts of your motor to increase the horsepower over the factory horsepower rating is forbidden.  I'm glad he got caught, and I'm sure he'll regret this for the rest of his fishing days.  Cheers!"
491278,lew,2010-08-04 16:22:00,12766,The embarrasment in front of his peers will probably hurt alot more than a monetary fine.  How could you ever face anybody again ??
491282,Guest LivingLegend,2010-08-04 16:37:00,0,"What a punk! Wondering how many tourny's he won because of this...... I ban him from fishing totally, heres to u buddy......"
491283,Nanook,2010-08-04 16:39:00,565,"Lew, People of that ilk, can soon brush it of as if nothing had happened. Just hope his Peers remember and treat him accordingly."
491284,asdve23rveavwa,2010-08-04 16:41:00,2690, I'd say lifetime ban from tournament fishing...hit him where it hurts.
491286,Dara,2010-08-04 16:46:00,3052,Just keep an eye on him if he moves over to walleye tourneys
491295,alexcba,2010-08-04 17:20:00,634,this was on last weeks fyi. the dudes an idiot. i cant believe someone would do something so ridiculous. you risk your lively hood to win a few extra bucks.. what an
491367,OhioFisherman,2010-08-04 20:45:00,6623,"Probably no risk to the dudes lively hood, bass fishing is a much bigger deal here stateside, but most of these guys also have regular jobs of some sort. Nice to show up at work and have your co-workers know you got banned for cheating?  It`s not to hard just in Ohio to fish two or three different circuits, prize money for the events and the top dogs get to fish a championship for a bass boat and some cash. Some weekend tournaments may offer a boat as a prize. There are guys that plan the fishing season around the tournament schedule. Plus there are usually open tournaments that have at least a 1000 dollar first place money. Supplemental income?"
491368,Guest LivingLegend,2010-08-04 21:11:00,0,Dude is banned in Canada! STAY OUT
491369,Paully,2010-08-04 21:15:00,712,Looks like he's swallowed a few boat anchors in the process too!
491374,Guest gbfisher,2010-08-04 21:36:00,0,"  Lots of well known names have been caught cheating here in Canada and are still in the game. Lots who just havent been caught as well. Usually they stop cheating after they get their sponsors and then ,,never win again,,,, It's nothing new....."
491379,fishinguypat,2010-08-04 21:53:00,547,this guy should stick to tarpon where a few ounces doesn't usually matter.... LOL
491661,jbailey,2010-08-05 18:31:00,866,what a goof i'm also glad he got caught
491689,skeeter,2010-08-05 19:57:00,1907,"BUSTED !!!!!!!!!!LOL  looks good on him. the cheaters are every where. we had a parent cheat in our kids fishing derby a couple of years ago. stuffing split shots down a sunfishes throat. best part is, the fishing derby is FREE and EVERY KID gets a prize... "
491741,jace,2010-08-05 22:28:00,472,"henry and italo got busted and that didn't stop them.   Sure it ended their careers in the short term, but all they did was wait for the next generation of fishing show fans to come of age before coming back out.  I'll bet most of the people watching them now don't know anything about it."

492136,alexcba,2010-08-07 00:27:00,634,  but we do!  and i'll never let them live it down with the people i know.
