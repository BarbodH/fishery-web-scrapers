492334,g_clot,2010-08-07 23:01:00,104,Just a heads up Survivorman on OLN is in temagami. It's on now.  Cheers
492338,BillM,2010-08-07 23:15:00,17367,Has he talked about beaver fever yet? lol
492342,Musky or Specks,2010-08-07 23:40:00,2710,I don't call him Survivorman I call him BuildaShelterandStarvefor7DaysMan!!
492347,lew,2010-08-07 23:46:00,12766," Yeah, ain't that the truth.  He always makes me think of someone who knows absolutely nuthin about bush survival and just barely lives long enough to be rescued.  I think any kid off the street could do as well"
492365,IndySKS,2010-08-08 00:53:00,134, Didn't someone try last winter with tragic results?
492370,ctranter,2010-08-08 01:05:00,543,"  Feel free to do it yourself and prove him wrong...  or you could continue to make ridiculous claims from the comfort of your living room.  Les is a true outdoorsman.  He continues to expose bear grylls for the fraud that he is.  If you think you can do it better, prove yourself."
492420,livinisfishin,2010-08-08 03:13:00,661,a quality tv show unlike many out there.
492431,Mattones,2010-08-08 04:19:00,587,I really enjoy the stuff he does and he is Canadian which makes it 10X better. His book is awesome aswell!
492441,Jewelbee,2010-08-08 09:52:00,422,Survivor Man ROCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
492608,dsn,2010-08-08 19:27:00,1018,"He's the thing I watch when there's not fishing show on.  I also purchased his ""BOOK."" Starting a fire with out a lighter or match isn't easy as he makes it. It is tough. I tried it with a magnify glass and only succeed once.  His his shelters is what I'm interesting in. Never know when they might come in handy.    dsn"
492621,ehg,2010-08-08 20:02:00,2666,"It is a good show, truly canadian"
492641,LefroyFisherman,2010-08-08 20:48:00,602,"Awesome show, must be exhausting doing all the camerawork yourself."

492754,g_clot,2010-08-09 02:24:00,104,"I missed the 'Beaver Feaver' and am afraid to ask .   It was funny seeing him with his brother though.  The sibling outdoorsman rivalry made the episode.  He's a funny dude, but a weath of knowledge.  "
