492268,highdrifter,2010-08-07 16:49:00,2534,"Forget about pike unless you can get the kids up at an ungodly hour and catch the 6:30am ferry..  I'd say bring some plastics and and work the slop for largies.  There's tons of carp there, but who wants to fish for those eh?!"
492367,SBCregal,2010-08-08 00:55:00,688,"thanks for the tips guy, but it looks like the trip isnt going to happen.  looking for somewhere else to head for the morning.  gonna head out to dunnville or port maitland area.  it'd be nice to get into some perch or walleye somewhere for a nice feed.  ryan"
