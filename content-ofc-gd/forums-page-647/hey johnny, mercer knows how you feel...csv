492374,fish-miester,2010-08-08 01:10:00,864,yup had the same thing happen with a 40'' ski last month haha not fun
492405,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-08-08 02:36:00,0,YIKES! I hope he is OK! Looks like he can still bend his!lol I've had a little pike squirm out of my hand and stick hooks in me and I've had a big pike thrash in the net in the boat and catch a piece of my leg!
492438,alexcba,2010-08-08 08:01:00,634,"he posted another shortly after, looks worse than the one above. he's gonna need a few stitches for sure."
492483,bassman,2010-08-08 13:50:00,384,"I've always thought that this would happen to Ron James from FISH TV. His pike handling skills are atrocious. I'm not a big fan of grabbing a pike from the gills with three trebles dangling from a fish's mouth.  Get well soon big fella, and please make sure you clean the blood stains on my future Skeeter  Cheers!"
