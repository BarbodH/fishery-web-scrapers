492616,Big Cliff,2010-08-08 19:39:00,6899,"Friday after noon I am making a left hand turn from the off ramp on 115/35 South onto Hwy 7 heading East. I have the green light, there cars stopped on my left and two cars on my right making a right hand turn. Just as my front bumper passes the center I heard a horn blaring from my right, I swung hard left and hit the brakes and this guy in a big Buik blew past me at well over 80. We were so close I'm surprised there wasn't paint transfer. He never even bothered to slow down. I was too shook up to go after him.  Saturday we were getting ready to go out and our neighbour asked me if I wanted to go for a quick ride on their new sea doo. He had been asking for quite a while and we had a few minutes to spare so I jumped on with him and we went for a short ride up the Scugog river. At one point there were two smaller boats in front of us so Daren cut the throttle to slow down. All of a sudden we got hit from behind by this big speed boat with a guy, his wife, and kids. I was pretty upset. Started yelling at the guy he'd almost killed me, in fact his boat never made contact with me but he did take a nice size chunk out of the Gel coat about 16"" from where my foot was. The guy turned out to be OK, was very apologetic and has agreed to pay for the repairs. Anyway I think I've just used up two of my nine lives in two days."
