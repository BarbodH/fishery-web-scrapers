492403,The Urban Fisherman,2010-08-08 02:25:00,2050,"I just wanted to give a shout out to Rotten Ronnies and the Long Point Bay Anglers' Association for putting on the Annual Kids Sunfish Tourny... It's a two day event, which they put on for the kids!  I think it's a great way to get the young ones into angling!  Averie looks forward to it each year and manged to win a prize this year! I couldn't be more proud!  It's on again tomorrow and I believe weigh in is once again by 3 p.m. at Rotten Ronnies!  Here's some pix of the kid...  Her first of the day - she didn't even put him in her bucket!   I wish I had that kind of confidence when fishin' tournaments! haha   Then she hit up the multi species program for a while with a few perch...   To bad it wasn't a perch derby because she was on fire with them today!   This Rock bass had no upper lip!   And her biggest of the day - Don't worry he's still alive... just not happy   Waiting to weigh in...   And the weigh in! lol   Good Enough for a prize and a picture for the local paper with the bigger boys!   Thanks again to Jimmy, the gang at Rotten Ronnies and to the LPBAA for putting this on for the kids... hopefully we can get more involved tomorrow and in the years to come!   Cheers, Ryan & Averie"
