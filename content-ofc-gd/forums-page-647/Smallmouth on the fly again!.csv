491396,FlyGuy5,2010-08-04 23:29:00,101,My friend Matt and I went out to serch for some river smallmouth on the Trent River last night. For the last little bit I've had great luck on my top water mouse pattren for smallies so I had it tied on with a 8 pound floro for a lead.  I had just laid down a nice long cast I believe it was my second cast when bamm a huge smallie comes leaping out of the water and misses my fly both Matt and myself just look at each other and were stoked.  I made only a few more casts when a smaller smallmouth came up and took my fly under up with the rod tip and fish on.  He put up a good fight for his size we took a couple of pictures and away he went.  Then it wasn't 3 minutes after that I made another long cast and stripped it in once and bamm I knew right away it was a good fish. Not having much line stripped in I was able to fight this fish with the rod and reel it was sweet. Again pictures were taken and it was let go.  Matt as well got a couple of nice fish and all in all it was a great day on the water.    
491397,FlyGuy5,2010-08-04 23:31:00,101,Matt with one as well with the pig I caught!  
491606,BillsTheBassMan,2010-08-05 15:06:00,932,I love those nights when you get out on the river and you can tell my your first couple casts that it's going to be a good one - makes up for some of the not-so-good days.  Do you ever nymph for SMB?  Nice smallies and thanks for sharing!
491845,FlyGuy5,2010-08-06 02:03:00,101,No not yet anyways but next time I'll throw some nymphs out and see what I get.  Do you use them and if so what nymph?  
491990,BillsTheBassMan,2010-08-06 17:21:00,932,"I'm still too new to fly-fishing to effectively nymph for smallmouth.  I generally get them on buggers (I've caught 3 SMB on 2 SMB fly-fishing trips).  When talking in my circles, however, I hear that big hexagenia nymphs are second to none, and idaho nymphs, as well as stonefly nymphs, can all get the job done.  Ryan"
492021,bare foot wader,2010-08-06 19:09:00,1354,"i find nymphing usually hits the smaller, juvenile fish but it does get you good numbers....crayfish, leeches, streamers and poppers are my bread n butter for big smallies.  for deep pools pickup a spare spool and either sink tip or full sink line and drag a crayfish pattern across bottom in the deepest part of the pool and along the edges and drop offs  one of my fav flies and not too well known is the gummy minnow...essential fly fishing answer to soft plastics...easy to tie your own and get as creative as you want with colours and adding lead to the hook shank......find fast water and focus on the current seams or back eddies....get upstream and toss your line out directly downstream and hold your fly exactly where you want it, strip the minnow, let the current push it back, whatever....if there's a bass holding near by it's deadly, can't resist it for very long"
492054,BillsTheBassMan,2010-08-06 20:27:00,932,   Very Nice . . . Thanks.  I'm going to look into the gummy - the lord knows I love my soft plastics.
492066,bare foot wader,2010-08-06 20:57:00,1354,"http://www.madriveroutfitters.com/l-p/gummy-minnows.html  sili skin in a few colours, some lead wire, and i prefer a finesse hook over a saltwater hook....pretty easy to tie   i think basspro in vaughan had them for 3.99 last summer"

492097,lunkerbasshunter,2010-08-06 22:27:00,2585,so sweet!!!  nice report on the fly!  cheers!
492183,Musky or Specks,2010-08-07 02:07:00,2710,One evening last summer while fishing for smallies last summer there was a cahill spinner fall. The smallies went nuts and I didn't have my fly rod with me. I'm going to try hitting that fall again sometime with flyrod in hand
492421,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-08-08 03:14:00,0,Nice! It must be a blast catching those bronze backs on a fly rod!
492455,Cast Adventures,2010-08-08 11:55:00,74, Looks like a blast! nice fish!!!
