I mounted the MotorGuide, Hummingbird and a make shift seat on the Weapon of Bass Destruction 2.  It occurred to me that after spending so much time on this boat that I have never water tested it. I had to get it in the water before making the trek north.    I called up Eddie Pinciero (aka Matt) and made arrangements for 7:30 the next morning.  We loaded up the boat and picked our gear.  My weapons of choice were my St.Croix/ Citica combo with a big white spinnerbait, my new to me Shimano Compre/Pflueger Supreme Baitcaster combo with a red Rapala J-11, and my Browning Medallion/ Pflueger Supreme spinning combo with a Berkeley Heavyweight worm.  Eddie brought his Rapala TS2/ Shimano Sedona combo with an inline spinner.    The water was 70 degrees and there was a strong west wind coming over the lake.  We started drifting to the east side of the lake. Ripping the spinner through weeds, and chucking around Stumps and rocks got us nothing.    We motored to the other end of the lake at an amazing speed creating a wake behind the boat.  The wireless MotorGuide was meant for this boat.      We hit up some proven hot spots and sunken trees and got nothing, could it be one of these?    I wasn't going to let that happen. We hit the shoreline and threw our lures under the trees until our arms were ready to fall off.    Finally Mr. Pinciero gets a hit and pulls it in like a train pulling a Volkswagen.  I look down and think it's a Rock Bass but no it's a little Bass, there will be no skunk in my boat.    Shortly after I decide to go back to the Spinnerbait and chuck it out.  As soon as it hits the water BAMMM... an immense weight that wants to tow us around the lake. I crank the Citica like a bear with boulder paws and bring the Beast to the boat. Not 2 feet from the boat it takes off straight down and wanted nothing to do with me. I refused to lose and brought her into the boat. She was a worthy opponent but no match for The Bear.      After a quick photo shoot with the creature, she was sent back to prepare for our next match.  It was time to get back in and was a great way to spend a couple hours on a Saturday morning.   Dan"
