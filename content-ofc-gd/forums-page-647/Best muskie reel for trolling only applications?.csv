492253,Fisherpete,2010-08-07 15:32:00,1814,"For those of you who troll for muskies, what is your baitcasting reel of choice? I am looking to pick up a reasonably priced one to pair up with a Compre that I have as a secondary rod for my son or guests when they fish with me. Cardiff? Tekota? Go the extra mile for a Calcutta? I have never had one with a line counter, I am thinking it might be a nice tool..."
492256,lew,2010-08-07 15:41:00,12766,I use a Tekota 600LC Pete and it's a great reel for trolling big baits. The line counter is also good to have so you know exactly where your bait is.  Here's a review of it.  http://www.tackletour.com/reviewshimanotekota600lc.html
492278,SlowPoke,2010-08-07 17:40:00,2984,The 600LC is great but a fair way outside of the prices you quoted.  Penn 209LC for $69 - This is a lifetime reel but certainly lacks the polish of the Tekota. Small investment; you get what you pay for and then some more! Bullet proof and great drag. http://www.cabelas.com/p-0052600122686a.shtml

492285,Garry2Rs,2010-08-07 18:07:00,1425,"In that price range there is also the venerable Abu 5500C or 6500C. They're not a rugged as the Penn's, but are easy to find. If you want a line counter, Shakespeare makes a reel that is called a Tidewater for about $80.00."
492289,Pigeontroller,2010-08-07 18:30:00,2793,"In that price range, Okuma Convector.  If you want to spend more, Shimano Tekota or Okuma Catalina.  If you don't want a line counter I'd go with an Abu 7000 with 4:1 ratio."
492357,esoxansteel,2010-08-08 00:37:00,1307,"Shimano Tecota LC I use both 500s and 600s, great drags nice and smoooooth and very dependable  "
492435,NANUK,2010-08-08 05:09:00,797,"Daiwa Sealine SG27LCA or SG47LCA, dependable line counter reels."
492579,Ron,2010-08-08 17:55:00,1683," Hate to say it but have to agree with the Anti on this one. (Yes, that was supposed to be funny.)  Perfect reel for the price for Kawartha Muskie. If you intend on fishing for Muskie on St. Clair, G Bay, St Lawarence, etc... Go with a better reel like the Shimano Tekota 600.  Personally, if you are looking for a spare setup for a guest in your boat, (Oh never mind just read the rest of your post, just looking for a trolling set up only)."
492584,Tybo,2010-08-08 18:05:00,1373,"Been Using a ABU 700 big game for a few years now.Seems to be a good stand up reel. Can't remember what I paid for it,but it was less then 100 on E-bay."
492710,aplumma,2010-08-09 00:42:00,6896,the tica caiman is a great reel and it is one that I use for 50 lb catfish for the past 3 years with no failures. Please advise them you are in Canada they have in the past been very Canadian friendly.   caiman Tica reels  Art
492775,Raf,2010-08-09 03:52:00,3495,"tekota is a nice reel but way out of your $$ range  the sealines are great if you're a righty, i've seen my partner use them for a number of years and they take a beating  i blew up a convector but it'll be fine for kawartha fish/lures.  i now use an abu 7001 and 6501.  don't be set on a LC.  you're propably rarely trolling with more than 50' of line out, simple to count 'pulls' or wraps."
