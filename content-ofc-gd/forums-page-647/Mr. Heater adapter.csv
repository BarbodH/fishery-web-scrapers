Well, I was at Lowe's in Whitby today and found they had the Mr. Heater one's for sale for $16.95 each!  I paid a lot more then that after shipping and taxes (almost double) when I got one last year.  So for those that want to fill a smaller tank from a 20LB tank then check your nearest Lowe's in the BBQ/Smoker section.  Cheers.  Geoff"
