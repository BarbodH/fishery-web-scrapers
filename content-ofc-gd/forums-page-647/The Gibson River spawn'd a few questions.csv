Caught a few fish, mostly bass and pike, but we did catch one walleye, some catfish, blue gill, crappie and rock bass.  The water in the river is really mercy and dark colored.  I found that the most productive lures for bass and pike where Hulla Poppers and Jitter Bugs, also got a few on a pink flatfish.  My week of fishing has left me with a few questions.  Maybe the wealth of knowledge here at OFC can help me out.  Questions #1 - Some (but not all) of the bass we caught where very dark.  All of the bigger ones where.  Is this because the water is so dark?  I've caught really dark colored bass before, but not this many.  See pic bellow, this is my wife's first bass, and first fish of a decent size.  She just started fishing this year, and she loves it!   Question #2 - I'm new to this Top Water thing.  I'm noticing tons of strikes, but I can't seem to get the hooks in.  Is this normal?  I'm using a light, sensitive walleye rod, with 6lb braid.  I think that's a little to light, as I broke off a few hulla-poppers trying to set the hook.  What is a good set up for top water?  Should I be hammering on the hock set right away, or letting them take it for a little before cranking it?  Here's a nice shot of the area we where fishing.   And here's my wife and dog enjoying a sunny day on the water.  The wind was cold that day! "

As far as the line...minimum 20 LB braid and don't set the hook till you feel the weight of the fish. It is a hard thing to do, but if you hook set as soon as you see it, the fish hasn't turned yet, and you just rip the lure from their mouth. Nice pics!"
