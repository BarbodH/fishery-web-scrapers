323882,Sinker,2009-03-30 01:40:00,8692,I think everything melted slow enough that we won't see much of a rise in water levels this year. Nothing like we had last year anyways. I think its going to be a weird spring. Things are going to start early.  Sinker
323892,2 tone z71,2009-03-30 01:51:00,1311,"your right ice out here this early is weird,gonna throw a screwing into the spring walleye again I presume, we had a hard time with them last yr"

Last year I was icefishing still on april 13th........kinda sucks......but I guess I'd better get the boat going eh?  I find I do better when its a late ice out for eyes, but that's just me. Should be a killer crappie/perch season though.......can't friggen wait!  Sinker"

324118,boatman,2009-03-30 20:41:00,350,"Highwater is long gone. The waterlevels should stay up for a little while, but the freshet is past. Waterlevels will increase faster than normal during rainfall events until the frost is thawed. Then its back to normal."
