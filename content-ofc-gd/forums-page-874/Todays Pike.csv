323383,msp,2009-03-29 00:02:00,1336,"Awesome. I love the pike porn. In 22ft of water,what are you catching em with? This month we have had moderate success with the gators in 5-8 ft on jerk baits. Very clean lookin fish."

323526,Fishnwire,2009-03-29 12:05:00,983,What did you use to get 'em that deep?  Were you trolling or drifting?  If you don't mind me asking.
