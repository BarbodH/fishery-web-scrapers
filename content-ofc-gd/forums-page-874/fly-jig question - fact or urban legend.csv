Is it because it will be more natural when hitting water next time, or just another urban legend?  Thanks!"

The feathers will NOT be matted and they will perform as good as new the next time you use the fly/jig. I use a foam Patch attached to my shoulder strap of my fishing bag so I can stick on the wet flies/jigs that I've changed on my line. When I get home they're usually dry and put them back in the fly box. If not I dry them with a hair dryer or hang them on a horizontal wire (in laundry room) before replacing in fly box.  muddler"
