323766,BigCP84,2009-03-29 20:45:00,3,"Hello everyone my name is Chris Parker, I am 25. I go fishing a lot but I always borrow my buddies spare rod, I think it is finally time to invest in my own gear. I live in Mississauga and I am wondering what is a good store to deal with. There are only 2 that I know of and that is Bass Proshops and JB's Fishing Depot, just because bass proshop is so huge and I drive by the Fishing Depot alot on the 401, I am sure there are a lot more around.  I dont really have a preference on gear except I would like to get a Abu Garcia Revo Winch reel. Can anyone recommend a store to deal with that sells this reel? and has good prices?  Thanks, Chris."
323768,GBW,2009-03-29 20:51:00,8460,"welcome to the board Chris.  Have you checked the OFC classified section for some new (or new to you) gear?  There are some great deals and great people here so have a look there too. I live in the East end so I can't help you with stores out your way but I'm sure others can help you find the baitcaster you want, cheers."
323769,ADB,2009-03-29 20:52:00,444,"Welcome to the board, Chris.  Le Baron Outdoor Products has a location in Mississauga - Dixie & Dundas. www.lebaron.ca  They sell fishing products, as well as camping, and hunting gear.  They're prices are usually hard to beat.  They don't carry the Winch model, so I can't help you there, though."
