323285,JohnF,2009-03-28 18:43:00,3494," As someone else said already - one never knows when business or pleasure will present the next opportunity for international travel, so why be unprepared? We North Americans are among the most affluent and internationally mobile of all of the world's societies, so it only seems logical to have a current passport for whatever travel opportunity presents itself. I'd sure hate to miss out on a great trip just because I hadn't bothered to renew my passport.  Besides, we only truly get to appreciate how lucky we are when we visit other countries. Canada just keeps looking better & better when you travel a bit.  JF"
323303,ozaibak1,2009-03-28 20:29:00,401," That's too bad, I enjoy seeing our Southern neighbors up here having a good time, I find most of them to be some of the more well-mannered, 'educated', and likeable Americans. I'm sure I'd be welcome and get along with them fine if I was on a trip down south. It annoys me to see that our border with America is being so heavily regulated, as much as Mexico's even, under the guise of 'security' which could be true but I see it to be Bull, the 'security' thing is just an excuse. If it wasn't so much of a hassle to fly and travel down there I'd be doing so much more often, it's a shame they have the fortress mentality, I guess us Canadians are quite the threat... to America?? Rly?  I'll tell ya if our border wasn't so tight I'd be down there fishin and huntin and minglin ALL THE TIME, I love Americans and their personality, but hate the policies of their government that don't represent noone but themselves! End of Rant."
323317,OhioFisherman,2009-03-28 21:04:00,6623,"LOL BassKiller, most Americans don`t like it either. Funny that Mexico is very strict on who enters there from it`s poorer neighbors(is that possible?) but they certainly don`t watch who is leaving their  northern border well!  Something on the news this morning? Between the amount of money illegals are sending home to Mexico and the illegal drug trade it equals almost half the legal trade between the US and Mexico. Our problems seem to be with the southern border. But politicians can screw up anything."
323378,Billy Bob,2009-03-28 23:54:00,5865,"  Oh YEA, it's definitely different down here. We have women with two heads walking around and some men with three legs running around......  ...... not to mention how much less they make us pay for gasoline....     Better stay in Canada where there are only normal Canadians walking about.....  ......LOL"
323381,Billy Bob,2009-03-29 00:01:00,5865," This is TRUE if you have a NEW YORK STATE ENHANCED Driver's License (EDL). I have not hear anything that the US Federal Government has accepted anything like this from Ontario or any other Canadian Provence. So if you are Canadian or any other foreigner you MUST have a passport to cross the border by any means starting JUNE 1st, 2009. SORRY,  I agree it all Bull..... The Mexicans are running right over EVERYDAY and most are not sent back but I need a passport or EDL to gain access BACK into my own country. LOL"
323390,Beats,2009-03-29 00:13:00,543,I also don't have one.  Not getting one in the near future either
323445,Greencoachdog,2009-03-29 03:25:00,8163," Ok!, this struck me as pretty fracking funny!!!  You'd think that being from the Deep South I'd experience more of a culture shock than anyone crossing the border, but the only thing I really notice is that your money is different, y'all talk kinda funny, and there's ""Paris talk"" all over the place.  Just wear your steel belted underwear when you cross the border Pike Slayer, you'll be ok!  .. unless you come to the Deep South... then we have a chainfall, a pair of fuzzy handcuffs, a cutting torch, and a 5 gallon bucket of white lithium grease with your name on them!!!"
323457,Guest skeeter99,2009-03-29 04:04:00,0,  yes the U.S. border accepts these new enhanced licenses from ontario and canada that was the idea behind so you would not have to spend the money on a passport for land travel only  we can thank harper for something LOL!!!
323460,Guest skeeter99,2009-03-29 04:08:00,0,  here is a link to a article to introduce the ontario enhanced license from the american motor association  http://www.aamva.org/Publications/TWiR/200...ndPhotoCard.htm
323469,Greencoachdog,2009-03-29 04:15:00,8163,"The enhanced drivers license are only good for ground and sea travel to and from the U.S.,Canada,  Mexico, and Caribbean!!  They're NOT valid for air travel, or travel outside of north america and the Caribbean!!!"
323470,danc,2009-03-29 04:16:00,4677,The drivers license passport thing is a long ways away. I travel to the US about once a month and I still don't have a passport. Better get moving here.
323484,Guest skeeter99,2009-03-29 04:35:00,0,  dont think so  i go over 3 to 5 times a month and the U.S. guards know about the new licenses and even one commented on them  almost eryone I know has the new license at work friends etc..
323485,Guest skeeter99,2009-03-29 04:37:00,0,  thanks coach  glad to see you can read this early in the morning never said they were good for air travel
323486,Guest skeeter99,2009-03-29 04:39:00,0,here is a article on the approval from november 2007  http://www.jeffwatsonmp.ca/news.asp?p=325
323492,Greencoachdog,2009-03-29 05:08:00,8163,  It's now 3/29/09 and you're posting an article from 2007???   ... timely!
323496,danc,2009-03-29 05:23:00,4677," I read about the new drivers license/passport proposal for the first time in the newspaper just a week or so ago. And they're out already? And you have one? Your current drivers license will let you across the border, but it is not a passport. Read the article that you linked to. It's just a proposal at this time. You're current drivers license is NOT a passport at this time, and never will be."
323498,Greencoachdog,2009-03-29 06:01:00,8163,"I'm not sure about Canada Dan, but the U.S. does have the enhanced drivers license and passport card... like I mentioned earlier, these aren't good for air travel... or travel outside the U.S., Canada, Mexico, or Caribbean islands. I only know this because I just recently applied for and recieved my U.S. Passport book, I opted for the book because I sometimes fly into Canada.  Right now is a good time to submit an application, as the deadline draws nearer the crunch/backup will surely rear it's ugly head again!  When I applied for mine at the beginning of February the lady said it would take about a month, I had my passport book in my hot little hand in 10 days!"
323501,jace,2009-03-29 06:46:00,472,"  I agree.   Unless there's a place for various border patrols to physically put the endorsements and visas stamps, a DL will never be equivalent to a passport.   There will always be remote entry points somewhere in the world that do not have computer access for any kind of electronic marking."
323522,Dartee,2009-03-29 11:55:00,47,"I travel into the states daily (for work) and a passport is a must. It is also required for my work visa. The border crossing i use does recognize the enhanced licence but will not except it in my case, it must be a passport since i'm working and not travelling for recreation."
323639,Billy Bob,2009-03-29 15:55:00,5865,"I have a way to settle this whole thing...  You Canucks stay on your side and us Yankees will stay on our side. Then we can cast Michigan crickets at each other over the Niagara River. If you  can snag someone from the other side and land him, he can stay and visit for a while.  ...LOL  NO passports required, just like catching a fish....."
323746,holdfast,2009-03-29 19:52:00,1813,  Government of Saskatchewan decided against the so called enhanced driver license.  WHY?  Because a Passport is cheaper and more versatile
323794,jace,2009-03-29 22:21:00,472,  There's no point in creating a brand new system when there is already a universally accepted system in place.
323817,Healthnut,2009-03-29 23:18:00,25,
323831,Dara,2009-03-29 23:56:00,3052,I live in a border town and I have mine. I snowmobile in Michigan a lot and it makes crossing easier. I need to get my nexus as well for fishing. We launch in Ontario and fish across the line in Michigan. A nexus card makes it easy when the coast guard wants to talk with you. I don't want the drivers licence. I been hearing they can be hacked for identity theft.
322683,outllaw,2009-03-27 10:51:00,1232,"after hearing mr harper state 75 per-cent of canada has passports. are you one of them. im curious as most i know have not, gotten them"
322687,Handlebarz,2009-03-27 11:00:00,3790,Morning George I can say that I am one that does not have one yet. I might have to get it for work with crossing the boarder daily but they can not give me a answer for sure its sad when I ask  the customs officers if my FAST card is good enough and they dont know the answer.
322696,jace,2009-03-27 11:26:00,472,  my whole family has one.  The last one was a sister who got it just a few years ago.   It all depends on if you ask people who fly often or not.   Anybody who flies to the US regularly likely applied for theirs a few years ago when they first announced that passports would be required for all flights and crossboarder travel.   They later changed that to exclude land crossing and now i don't know exactly where it stands because it's been changed a few times.
322705,The Urban Fisherman,2009-03-27 11:51:00,2050," My whole family (including my 2 year old daughter) has theirs.  It's MUCH easier to get it done nowadays.  Anybody who's had a passport for 5 years I believe can vouch for you and sign your forms.  We ordered my wife's on a monday and had it by the end of the week.  It's probably less effort to just get them than to deal with the customs officers every time.  Makes crossing the border a sinch - and if you ever want to go on a trip in whim, you're good to go.  cheers, UF"
322711,Randy,2009-03-27 12:24:00,115,Nope.
322714,lookinforwalleye,2009-03-27 12:30:00,4399,"Like others have said if you like to travel you probably have had one for sometime now, Harper is probably right all the new Canadians have one it`s probably just the homebodies that are holding out."
322717,holdfast,2009-03-27 12:39:00,1813,"Nope not me.  Ha, Harper, Youre wrong.  I Caught you, you lied. LOL"
322718,Raf,2009-03-27 12:40:00,3495,yep working on my nexus too.
322726,jace,2009-03-27 12:51:00,472,"Finding a suitable guarantor was the problem for most people since it was such a short list of qualifications and it couldn't be somebody paid to do it so a notary public woudln't work.   The renewal process that came out about a year ago is definitely better.  It's basically 2 new pictures and a short application where it was essentially the full application before.  the simple renewal still charges full fees, of course.  We're still getting burned compared to US citizens since their passports are good for 10 years and cost about the same as our 5yr passport.  talk about a cash grab..   "
322728,Gerritt,2009-03-27 12:54:00,6129,applied for mine yesterday... I was in line for all of 3 seconds... now is the time to get it done... before the June 1st deadline.  G
322751,Maverick,2009-03-27 13:58:00,371,Uhh yeah chalk me up under that 25% that doesn't. Probably should do so soon though.
322756,BillM,2009-03-27 14:04:00,17367,Makes crossing the border much less of a hassle.  I've had one since I was 16.
322992,Billy Bob,2009-03-27 23:09:00,5865,There is a BIG push here in the Buffalo area to get either a passport or Enhanced Drivers License which is what I got. But just yesterday on the NATIONAL news here that comes on after the local news at 6:30pm said passport applications are DOWN about 20% because of the economy. Go Figure.......
323004,pike slayer,2009-03-27 23:45:00,1177,"i got mine a month or to back, but i have no desire to go down in the states, i live on a border town and i refuse to go unless i absolutly have to like for work or picking up a package, its a whole other world other there as soon as you cross over that line, i would care less if they cut us off from going over there for good."
323132,Guest skeeter99,2009-03-28 05:52:00,0,"why bother with the passport unless u are flying to the u.s or going to a carribean country that needs it?  if you are driving all you need is the new drivers license, they actually look dorky and kind of counterfeit  IMO  never had a issue at the border tell them were u been/going/how long/receipts in hand   thanks for coming   my wife actually took my daughter to erie pensylvannia to splash lagoon waterpark, I printed out my own travel letter giving my wife permission to travel with her and the border guard said that is good!!  but on website it says needs to be notorized?"

323151,NAC,2009-03-28 11:42:00,369,tourism in Ontario will take a big hit this summer because there's a lot less Americans with them than Canadians. Americans make up a large portion of our tourism revenue.
323152,wgk36,2009-03-28 11:45:00,69,"Got the entire family setup last year.  I had one in the past, but never renewed it.  It's alot easier now that any passport holder can be your guarantor.  I think that everyone should have one, for tose last minute trips."
323154,OhioFisherman,2009-03-28 11:52:00,6623,"nomad, sorry to say you might be right, vacations are now being called staycations or naycations. Different perspective on the passport thing, in the winter you have to leave your country to find some heat, we just go a few states south.  Just me but I never needed a passport the only time I ever left this country was to visit yours. No need or desire to go anywhere else."
323160,lew,2009-03-28 12:23:00,12766,Last trip across the border for me was 13 years ago and I won't be bothering with a passport.  Still got waaaaaaaaaay too many corners of  Canada to explore yet
323171,pigeonfisher,2009-03-28 12:40:00,696,Wife and kids all have passports (needed them to get Visas). I am of the thought that it is better to have one than not.
323183,JohnF,2009-03-28 13:14:00,3494, Our world is ever shrinking. Passports are just one more must have.  JF
323189,pigeonfisher,2009-03-28 13:34:00,696,You never know when your name will be called to visit an international customer or supplier.  Always good to be prepared.
323225,pikehunter,2009-03-28 15:39:00,1659,"The whole passport idea to enter the US is a bunch of crap, and actually you really need a passport to ""return"" home. Not saying you will get into the States without one, but that is the principle.  As far as I'm concerned I don't need one. I will just keep my funny coloured money here at home in Canada. I'm not going to invest 200 bucks for passports for my wife and I just for day trips or the occasional southern vacation...they don't want my money I'll keep it at home. At least that is my current opinion, that could change on a below zero blustery winter day next January or February.  And to think I once had a US green card!"
323279,Tomcat,2009-03-28 18:26:00,395,"I've had a passport since the early 80s because work involved international travel. Although retired, I still renew my passport every 5 years - facilitates crossing the US/Canada border both ways. And as already stated, the renewal process now takes less than 10 days."
