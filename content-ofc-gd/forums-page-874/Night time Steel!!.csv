323379,msp,2009-03-28 23:55:00,1336,"Hey guys,  Nice report. That sure is a beauty hen. Hard work usually pays off in the long run. You guys deserve every one of those fish."
323380,BillM,2009-03-28 23:55:00,17367,"Cliff and Bly you guys rock!!   The 'solo' pose is dead on  Congrats, those are some nice fish."
323392,ccmtcanada,2009-03-29 00:20:00,7971," Hey EHG...that's funny...because I'm always amazed at your dead of winter soft water Lake O reports!!!  I still haven't had the guts to try that yet...   Thanks Kennyman...we are not legends...what I didn't report on is that we were out 4 times in the past few weeks at night and only caught 2 fish bigger than our fists...LOL   Didn't have to tell Sydney...she read your post Cliff and yelled out ""YAY!!!!""   Yep...we use glow sticks.  Shhh.....lol    You know what I'm talking about....LOL.    One out of two isn't bad....we are not pros....we got lucky that night...right place right time...but my daughter is cherubic.  Thanks!       Burtress and Camillj...I can honestly say there was no photoshopping in this report....LOL."
323394,ccmtcanada,2009-03-29 00:22:00,7971," As it got later, it did get colder and colder...and the water is freezing!!   I was exhausted...up at 5am for work and then out fishing at night...   Last weekend it was you kickin our butt!!!  We decided to try another trib, thinking the home trib would be slow...when I saw your report I"
323476,snag,2009-03-29 04:22:00,1932,Great report followed by a great birthday report!!  More congrats on the latter   It's been awhile and I miss seeing you two but you know how it is.......  Happy to see you're all healthy and happy.  I'm sure you're struggling like all;  but you've provided some great relief in your posts.  Be glad to see you again.  S.
323482,kemper,2009-03-29 04:30:00,2232,"Nice!  No wonder we couldnt catch a cold today.  Well thats a lie, but as soon as the sun peaked out it was DONE. Catching fish in total darkness is interesting.  I snagged a lamprey today....by the tail. Figure that out."
323518,Spiel,2009-03-29 11:40:00,9065,"Oh I don't know Cliff, I'm thinking it could be ""epic""."
323638,MJL,2009-03-29 15:54:00,2427,Well done C&C  The chrome is so bright you need to wear sunglasses at night   ...Some real beauties you two managed to get into.  Happy belated b-day to the little one.
323645,TroutnMuskieHunter,2009-03-29 16:03:00,1362,Way to go guys....nice steelies...

323898,Paulus,2009-03-30 01:57:00,522,"Awesome report, thanks for posting! You guys are giving me ideas...  p.-"
323999,Victor,2009-03-30 14:13:00,1609,I'm so jealous of you guys ... just started doing this steelheading thing and I still haven't hooked one legitimately ...  Thank you for the great report!
324101,fishnsled,2009-03-30 19:56:00,3520,A belated happy birthday Sydney  Some beauties there Cliff and Carole!  Congrats!
323164,ccmtcanada,2009-03-28 12:29:00,7971,"Bly and I, like many others here I'm sure, love float fishing for Steelhead, but are not crazy about the weekend crowds. Especially now that the weather is warming up.  Anyhow, one way to beat those crowds is to fish at night. Most times we try we get skunked, or catch just one between the two of us.   Sure it's a bit more difficult, the numbers usually aren't the same as fishing during the day...but sometimes...you just have a great night....and earlier this past week, Bly and I had that night!  We arrived at the creek after sunset and started drifting.  The waters were a bit higher and faster than normal...which usually isn't good, but the visibility was great.  The first 45 minutes got us nothing...not a hit...not a sniff!  Suddenly the fish began to run.  We could hear them coming up the rapids just below the pool we were fishing.  A slight adjustment to our setups and all meyhem broke loose!  Bly caught the first one...a great 30 inch one for Team 1...We affectionately call this ""the Solopaddler pose""   Very soon after that, she landed her second...   A few missed hits...I lost a few big ones after some long fights....but I finally got a nice one.   They just kept on coming...more fish running upstream....           As quickly as the bite turned on, it turned off.  Bly went 5 for 6 and I was 3 for 5...a few that were lost were some pretty big fish!!  What an amazing few hours on the tribs...a great way to end a day.  We'll let the weekend warriors walk the banks today...while we get set for a birthday party....our little one turned 7 earlier this week, and her friends are coming over later.  Before we left for the evening, she said ""Good fishing luck mommy and daddy""....we're convinced she brought us that luck!!  Here's a pic from her birthday... "
323175,ehg,2009-03-28 12:49:00,2666,Youse never cease to amaze on the variety and success in your reports We are lucky to have Bly on Team 1 there will be more contributions still to go surely.  Happy birthday to your daughter! Have a great weekend.
323196,kennyman,2009-03-28 14:13:00,737,You guys are turning into fishing legends. I'm telling you ...................... you need your own fishing show. Thanks for posting again. I enjoy every one of them. Your daughter looks like a sweetheart. Hope she has fun on her birthday. Does she know her parents are legends ??  P.S. Love the WFN shots (see the pandimonium has begun LOL).
323202,lucabrasi,2009-03-28 14:25:00,114,WTG! Excellent report. Happy B-Day to your daughter

323216,Scott S,2009-03-28 15:02:00,203,I'm with you guy's not big on crowds. But I've tried the night fishing and never had nothing like that. I'm going to have to try again after seeing those pics. Great job as usual guys. Scooter
323217,limeyangler,2009-03-28 15:09:00,5204,Great stuff Cliff!  Those are some nice looking fish....and happy Birthday to your daughter...i still remember your post last summer when she got a prize for best Perch in the kids fishing derby...watch out Mr. Izumi...Sydney is coming to get ya!
323219,silverstreak,2009-03-28 15:17:00,146,I have also done a lot of night fishing in the past (don't like the crowd thing either) and can tell you that night fishing is either boom or bust. Looks like the both of you timed it just right. WTG and great pic's too.
323223,JeffBornFishin,2009-03-28 15:34:00,260,Nice report guys wow  Nice looking fish!  Looks like Sidney got a good haul too  Happy Birthday!
323227,Big Cliff,2009-03-28 16:02:00,6899,"WOW, what a haul (on both counts)  Give that Princess Sydney a huge hug for me, tell her it won't be long before I can give her one myself!"
323231,tibbs,2009-03-28 16:09:00,650,Great Job Guys!  Do you guys use glow sticks on the floats for night fishing?
323239,solopaddler,2009-03-28 16:26:00,8605,solopaddler pose?  (Nice bunch of fish guys!)
323240,Moosebunk,2009-03-28 16:30:00,3970,Epic... absolutely NOT!!!  Pretty amazing though.  8 for 11... great job in the dark.
323255,The Urban Fisherman,2009-03-28 17:11:00,2050,"Absolutely AMAZING report.  I love that shot of Bly doing the ""solo"" pose.  Very well done from both a photography and angling point of view.  Before you know it Bly will be turning up in fishing mags!  And your daughter sure is a pretty girl Cliff... You better keep her interested in fishing and away from the boys!  I hope she has a great birthday!  Thanks for the report as usual guys.  I've said it before and I'll say it again, there's many a man here on OFC that is jealous of the time you guys spend on the water together as a couple.  Cheers, Ryan"
323273,Joeytier,2009-03-28 18:01:00,3990,"Wow, great report.  Looks like you guys had a pretty high average weight."
