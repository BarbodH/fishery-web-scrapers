323936,Angler16,2009-03-30 04:31:00,188,Hey all just wondering Put brand new stren 30 pound braided on the reels last summer should i re do all the rods?Or should i be ok?
323937,Guest skeeter99,2009-03-30 04:41:00,0,should be good for at least 3 years depending on usage  braid is pretty tough  if you want to change save money and flip the line over  cause the stuff deeper on the spool never gets used
323940,EC1,2009-03-30 05:12:00,930,"Don't go and waste more money on new braid. Braid isn't like mono and doesn't deteriorate over time / get memory. The braid should be fine for you to use until you feel that you don't have enough line on your spool. If braid were to be changed every year, I think I would have just stuck to mono because of its price tag."

324163,Leecher,2009-03-30 21:59:00,7832,You may want to use another reel and unspool the one that you have onto it..... This is what I did for my 2 spinning reels and it's good to go!!!  Leechman
