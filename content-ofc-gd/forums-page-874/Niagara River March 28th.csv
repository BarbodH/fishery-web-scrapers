When we arrived at the launch there was a steelhead derby being put on by the Niagara Steelheaders. I thought what the heck and joined us up. The derby was for the Canadian side only so we ended up staying in the same drift all day well almost everyone else ran down river.  It wasn't long before we got into some scrappy fish, and man they where scrappy this weekend! Lots of drag screaming! Dan hooked the first fish, a dark male that put up a decent fight. Then a hefty hen that went around 12lbs, just a beauty fish. I kept hooking them but straightening the hooks! I was getting pretty ticked off, no more owner hooks for me. Fiinally I got into some good fish and managed to get them into the boat.  It was a great day on the water and we manged to boat  some nice fish and lost way too many. We did better then most guys on numbers but fell short by an inch and a half when it came to biggest fish. A 32"" won  around $450 and second was 31"" scoring around $300 It was a great derby, put on by JWL. Thanks for letting us in:)  Fun for everyone! Check out the next one  tightlines Ryan Hare   here are some pics of the day         same fish different view     "
