323447,Guest gbfisher,2009-03-29 03:29:00,0,I think it comes with three cards that are able to load parts of each map you want. The Map program anyway. Disc included. If yer tryin to copy from someone elses maps it won't work.  I have road maps on a chip of Southern Ontairo and Southern Quebec with part of the states that I use with my H20 in the summer.

323668,Billy Bob,2009-03-29 16:25:00,5865,I have a Lowrance Chip that has all the streets in Canada and the US plus it also has TOPO maps for all your lakes. I used just once to navigate and not get lost on the French River last June. I am willing to sell to you if your interested in it.
