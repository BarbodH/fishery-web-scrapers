I just hope they are found before night fall....  G

323401,irishfield,2009-03-29 00:37:00,26272,Wouldn't doubt if someone called in what they thought was a crash.. and all it was was an instructor and student practicing engine failures to an open field.

How many planes have crashed this/last year now? Its getting ridiculous. Recession making airlines/flight schools, etc.. cut maintenence costs or something? I really hope this trend doesnt continue."
323550,Jer,2009-03-29 12:49:00,1426,  I don't know if any more planes are crashing recently than before...  ...maybe you're just noticing more now that you're a pilot and paying more attention. It's like when someone you know buys a new car...suddenly you see that model of car everywhere you go.
323595,Guest gbfisher,2009-03-29 14:00:00,0," That sure is part of it. Truth is that you do not hear about all the little PP accidents. When you take off from any small or private airport, have a look at the end of the runway ...out in the fields. You'd be amazed. Most are walked away from. They don't call em controlled crashes for nothing...."
