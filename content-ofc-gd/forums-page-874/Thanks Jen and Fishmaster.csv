It must have been fun to watch such a stubborn person not give up untill it was well past obvious that it was not gonna happen.   I hope this is not a sign of how my season is gonna go.... PS the skunk is still strong *sigh*"

Atleast you got out and gave it your best shot!  See you again soon, hopefully everything will go smoothly for you next time!  Cheers  Jen"
