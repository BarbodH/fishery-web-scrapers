323248,Moosebunk,2009-03-28 16:56:00,3970,This thread is funny!
323253,shane,2009-03-28 17:08:00,652,"  If I have multiple personalities, can I declare myself as a dependent on my income taxes?"
323258,Tybo,2009-03-28 17:21:00,1373,I tried that. They said only if I was institutionalize in the past 18 months.
323261,sonny,2009-03-28 17:31:00,511,"Many time i thought that someone was fishing with more rods then allowed and when got closer someone pops there head up from lying down,,especially when it's cold out,,,but enough said,,2 rods per angler in the great lakes,,,Also if you know what your doing tangles are usually not an issue,,,i can run 8 rods without tangles from my 16.5 foot baot"
323268,trapshooter,2009-03-28 17:47:00,1234, That's hilarious Paul.
323391,Billy Bob,2009-03-29 00:19:00,5865,I would bet he is perfectly legal because the two rods pointing forward are not in the water and only laying in the bow of the boat as extra rods. They may be casting rods when they are tired of trolling or maybe set up for perch fishing later. I have more rods in my boat then I am legally allowed to fish with many times but if there just in the boat and not towing lures around what's wrong with that.  Bob  I take it all back after taking a second look but this time with my reading glasses on. I do see now the extra planer boards.
323524,Fishnwire,2009-03-29 12:01:00,983,"If he is alone and he's actually fishing with all those lines...he's taking an awfully big chance.  If a CO approaches him he's screwed.  He's obviously less worried about fines than I am.  If he was on some backwood lake I'd assume he's poachin'...but to do it out in the open where a million people can see you?  Maybe he's doing some sort of testing or maintainance.  Who knows?...maybe he's just a bonehead with a huge set of stones.  I've never understood guys who attempt to fish with a bunch of extra lines.  If the bite is not on, a dozen extra lines probably won't help...and if they are hitting, one line (maybe two) is all you can effectively fish with.  I understand that it's good to cover a lot of water when trolling...but managing 6 rods by yourself can't be very relaxing or enjoyable."
323536,Cudz,2009-03-29 12:26:00,2652,I agree with Wayne.  I bet he just got new planer boards and is testing how they are running. He might have only had them out there for a couple of minutes to see how they ran and I bet there was no lures on a couple of them.
323563,kickingfrog,2009-03-29 13:10:00,8333," Boy, I bet ""your"" kids pull crap on you all the time... and get away with it.  You might be right, I really doubt it, and we'll never know. But what the heck, the lakes will be thawed soon enough."
323566,Cudz,2009-03-29 13:15:00,2652,Was trying to give the guy the benefit of the doubt. My kids (at school) don't get away with anything. My kids (at home) do.  lol
323640,irishfield,2009-03-29 15:56:00,26272,"  Guess I should have added a smiley to my post..  .. but there are, at least, two people in the boat ! Jamie... post a full res pic !"
323657,Steve,2009-03-29 16:12:00,2075,"you want a hi resolution pic? its going to take all the fun out of this thread.    Of course, the pic that was added on here by Jamie was after a little photoshop fun.  Its me in the pic.  I've received a number of pm's from folks who saw the original pic....  This has all been in good fun.  "
323661,irishfield,2009-03-29 16:21:00,26272,I was going to ask him right at the start Steve... cause the planer boards were shopped!  Still looks like two in the boat... you eating well ?? lol
323671,eye-tracker,2009-03-29 16:29:00,89,"That is funny jamie, The first thing I noticed was the boards on the port side where not on the right angle or distance back for the image and suspected a doctored image right off the bat.  :D  :D -s"
323687,Guest gbfisher,2009-03-29 16:52:00,0,good one Jamie.... That lilttle video you gave me a while back of the guy drumming up business for someone elses lures.....You know the one. I know the mods are very aware of it. I had the head changed with another persons head and of course...I posted the original by mistake.....
323920,swampdoggr7,2009-03-30 03:07:00,5,"crap, paul, when did they let you out?"
323957,BUSTER,2009-03-30 10:44:00,1336,photo shop!  lol  ever read your own signature?
324036,Squid,2009-03-30 15:58:00,1656,"You know,as funny as this is there are plenty of fishermen who know better but still use six rods for two guys while fishing for salmon. Take a trip out to the so called blue zone and you will see what I mean. There are fishermen out there using illegal spreads because they figure they are far out enough from shore that the Co's will not nab them."
324039,bigfish1965,2009-03-30 16:03:00,3382," Please...don't do this again. If you need to ask why, then maybe you should find another place to hang out."
324081,Toronto_Angler,2009-03-30 18:06:00,698,  Thank-you
324083,Headhunter,2009-03-30 18:22:00,5703,"I understand that the pics are that of (Hamilton?) Steve and has been doctored. What I will say to all who think that kind of spread is unmanageable... it most certainly is! Assuming there are three folks in real life in that boat(to manke it legal) , that spread, done properly is more than manageable and one of the first folks who I would say could set it up and manage it would be (Hamilton) Steve. HH"
324088,outllaw,2009-03-30 19:15:00,1232,pretty sad and immature. then we get into blaming other areas for the overodding. . talk about trolling.
323062,Crazyhook,2009-03-28 01:36:00,1154,"My mother in law was walking her dog and saw what she called the most organised fisherman in the world. He was trolling loads of rods. She asked me what would happen if the guy had a few \"" bites\"" at once... "
323066,DRIFTER_016,2009-03-28 01:41:00,10439,I hope there's a couple of people hiding or he's breaking the law. Only 2 rods per angler.
323067,kickingfrog,2009-03-28 01:43:00,8333,Maybe his 2 buddies are laying down in under the gunwales?
323069,pike slayer,2009-03-28 01:51:00,1177,"honestly! like hes even having a good time out there, seems to be alot more work then whats its worth. get a fish on and it gets snagged up in his million other lines. rod and reel companys must love guys like this.can you zoom in on the pic and see the numbers on his boat?"
323072,Daplumma,2009-03-28 01:57:00,1961,Looks like six or so to me. Joe
323074,Maverick,2009-03-28 02:04:00,371,If he had my luck he'd spend about 15 minutes trolling and 4 hours untangling the rats nest I would get with that many lines in the water.
323085,NANUK,2009-03-28 02:28:00,797,
323090,Roger_Dodger,2009-03-28 02:50:00,9,not sure what the big deal is?
323095,irishfield,2009-03-28 03:07:00,26272,He's just doing a test run on his planer boards Jamie....
323096,kickingfrog,2009-03-28 03:11:00,8333," It looks like there is one angler, 6 rods fishing and 5 planer boards in the water. That is not legal on Lake Ontario on the Ontario side."
323097,buckster,2009-03-28 03:13:00,530,looks like to me that there is 2 guys there
323098,GBW,2009-03-28 03:14:00,8460,"zoom in more, it looks like he's got a dog with him by the front seat  Yes, 2 rods only per person in Lake O in our side.  Maybe he's working on getting line twist out?"
323099,irishfield,2009-03-28 03:14:00,26272,  Yep...one standing.. one sitting tiller.  Maybe it's a baby in a carrier on the front seat. 6 rods is fine then... .
323100,GBW,2009-03-28 03:16:00,8460,now that I have zoomed in to 400% there could be another person sitting in front of the person standing.  Even if there is 2 people in the boat they should only have 4 rods/lines in the water.
323102,Crazyhook,2009-03-28 03:23:00,1154,Maybe he is just getting his Lake sT CLAIR ON?
323103,Roger_Dodger,2009-03-28 03:23:00,9,how do you not know that a couple of those lines are not being run with clean attractors (no hooks) thats not totally uncommon to do so ya know... and very legal to do so  if im out solo ill stack a rod with a clean dodger a few feet above (or below) my main line on a rigger
323106,GBW,2009-03-28 03:31:00,8460,hence my reply about line twist.
323108,kickingfrog,2009-03-28 03:33:00,8333," I don't know what it is, and I don't know where it is. I said what it looked like, not what it was. Glad you know what it was."
323113,mistyriver1,2009-03-28 04:04:00,600,"Jamie, I think I see a white bucket"
323117,Greencoachdog,2009-03-28 04:14:00,8163,Everything looks ok to me!
323126,xeon,2009-03-28 04:50:00,350,"Jokes on him, he's only going to loose 6x more tackle if things get tangled up even a little."
323127,Zebco,2009-03-28 04:52:00,123,If they bust him they better bust the hundreds of illegal immigrants smelt fishing in Lake Ontario!
323182,Carp,2009-03-28 13:05:00,1488, So that's where all the bait fish went.
323242,NANUK,2009-03-28 16:33:00,797,"Unless there are 2 others laying on the floor(which is not likely) he is fishing alone. and NO there is no baby in the crib  what you see in the front is an empty chair or a boat seat, there is no one else sitting in that boat!! his placement of planer boards indicates that he knows how to run the spread, some one who really knows his stuff and does it all the time."
323246,jediangler,2009-03-28 16:42:00,1923,Maybe he has multiple personalities   .
