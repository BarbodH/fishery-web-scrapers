But I want to be able to keep it if I move up in size to a 14 or 16' aluminum.  I'm going to be fishing Rondeau bay mostly, and the shallows have a lot of weeds... so I'm thinking I'll need a pretty high LB thrust to get through the weeds ?  Does the higher the thrust mean the faster it goes ? or just the more bottom end / ability to get through the weeds it has ?  Also, I think if we go on some lakes up north, I want to be able to use the electric troller for troller as opposed to the gas one,  what sort of battery would be best for this application ?  Price is a concern, but all will be considered !  Thanx for any help   :D  "
