323464,snag,2009-03-29 04:10:00,1932," Bernie is one great guy!  Stopped by my work and introduced me to his wonderful family.  They found this whole internet fishing thing a little strange/ concerning.  I assured them we are normal.  Then they called security.   """"""sent from SNAGS BLACKBERRY FROM JAIL**********"
323828,dsn,2009-03-29 23:48:00,1018,Should have taken that pic out earlier ah ha ha ha.  dsn
323864,ehg,2009-03-30 01:10:00,2666,"Good to meet you down there DSN! Went down Saturday for a bit and had lethargic pike follows, did see that salmon you spoke of. Was skeptical when you mentioned that but saw it yesterday, was a coho on its last legs.  Wasn't a million lurkers there due to post but did run into OFNCer douG there for real. Pleasant fellow he was."
323997,salmon,2009-03-30 13:57:00,334, Too late LOL J
322929,ehg,2009-03-27 20:29:00,2666,"Seeing that it was a beautiful non-winters day, thought i would go take a few casts for some Toronto harbour pike. The waters were calm and people were out and aboot enjoying the spring sun. Took a few casts and then some guy with a fishing rod stopped by and seemed to recognize me. It was Grant who goes by 'Snag' on this board. We chatted and fished, he kept getting lots of follows. Eventually one of those pike bit his lure and the fight was on. After a short tussle the pike was landed and a picture was taken. The fish measured 33 inches but wouldn't stay still for pic. Nice fat healthy Toronto harbour pike.       Great meeting you Grant, hopefully we will meet down there again! Thanks for showing how the piking is done there. ehg"
322932,Joeytier,2009-03-27 20:33:00,3990,"Wow, what a fattie! Nice catch."

323088,msp,2009-03-28 02:42:00,1336,Nice lookin pike dare buy.  I like the reverse shot. Maybe the steelheaders will start to adopt the new pose !!!!
323092,snag,2009-03-28 02:58:00,1932,"Jumpin' Judas!  Not me, LOL  DouG is the ugly beast in that shot!! (shaved the goatee/flavour savour/soul patch!)  Can't steal his glory.  (I wouldn't give a proctologist shot)   Nice try Erik!  Can't believe that 4 OFNer's (DouG, EHG, DSN and SNIG) were in one place! The apocolypse is looming............    Congrats DouG!!  Great to finally meet you Erik!  (DouG, you are hideous without facial hair buddy!)"
323114,Greencoachdog,2009-03-28 04:10:00,8163," Now that I take a second look... that is douG mooning the camera and holding the Poike backwards!!!  I can't believe I mistook douG's    for Snags face!!!... butt really, they could be twins!!!"
323169,ehg,2009-03-28 12:33:00,2666,"Hey Snag, good to meet you unexpectedly and that was a nice pike you caught.  I like how the photo turned out, it really shows the girth and markings of the fish despite its twisting around. You sure have the magic touch for them T.O pike, no one else caught any at the time or had as many follows.  Cheers, ehg"
323176,Carp,2009-03-28 12:50:00,1488,Good shooting.
323187,douG,2009-03-28 13:30:00,2693,"I was fishing the same area, chatting with Grant by phone, but I had only one follow, right to shore in a foot of water, but I couldn't get that lady to commit.  Nice fish, Grant."
323190,salmon,2009-03-28 13:37:00,334, OOH It's the elusive picture of SNAG (Grant) Is that a Harper...... jacket you got on? LOL Nice moon shot LOL  Jose
323411,dsn,2009-03-29 00:54:00,1018," Ah what did I tell you.. ""Didn't I say that there was a monster in that area."" Too bad I missed out on how you got that out of the water without a net.  Nice fat pike!! Nice meeting ehg DSN"
323417,skeeter,2009-03-29 01:01:00,1907,  coach dog.......... turn your monitor around then it will look right !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
323431,rockfish,2009-03-29 02:30:00,91,"Hey that spot looks familiar.   Nice back side shot of a restless Pike, Grant.  Good meeting u today and too bad we couldn't get any critters to chomp a lure today instead of just following them."
323438,snag,2009-03-29 02:53:00,1932,O.k.  Now it's creepy.  That's not me.
323442,rockfish,2009-03-29 03:12:00,91," We know there are no pics of you on here, you are the Unknown Comic, (think was from the Gong show for those of u that remember it).  You shoulda went for the blue side of the salami pill instead of the red side.  You've entered a whole new reality now as a different being."
323444,Cudz,2009-03-29 03:15:00,2652,"It is true.  That is not Snag.  The guy holding the fish is Jeremy Piven.  He was in Toronto this week and he always hits up the harbour for a chance at some city pike.  It is in his autobiography.  He states ""Whenever I visit Toronto Canada I bring my fishing rod.  You can actually catch trophy pike right in the city."" "
323448,snag,2009-03-29 03:33:00,1932,  AGREED!!
323449,Greencoachdog,2009-03-29 03:34:00,8163, He is his own entity!!!  ... it's a little known fact that he uses live Atlantic Salmon for bait to catch those Schnag-a-rific Poike!!!
323450,snag,2009-03-29 03:36:00,1932," Thank you Cudz!!!!  I get the ""Jeremy Piven"" thing, all the time!  I would love to see his reports.  Sheeeeesh!  Cheers mate!"
323451,Greencoachdog,2009-03-29 03:47:00,8163, Isn't Jeremy Piven that transexual that lost his/her nadz in an interspecies-erotica act with a Mudskipper???
323452,Bernie,2009-03-29 03:48:00,3190,Hey...Funny thing.... I bumped into Jeremy in Mississauga today. Heck of a good guy too! I have never met Snag or seen his his whole face in a picture so I have no idea what he looks like.
