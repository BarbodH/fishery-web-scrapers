324167,1Harringtona,2009-03-30 22:14:00,77,"Hi  About 6 months ago I decided to install an amp and a few subs into my car. All was fine until a few hours ago when I was coming home and I hit a small bump (man hole cover) and my speakers went crazy, they were whining very loud, loud enough that I could not hear the music at all. so when I got home I checked all the wires to see if any were disconnected and yes one of the speaker wires wwas but when I connected the wire back to the speaker the noise continued.  I tried conecting one speakers at a time and the noise persisted then I tried turning the gain on the amp down (didnt work) I tried switching fuses in the amp (didnt work). Basically disconected every wire and connected them again (didnt work).  Also I would like to add this sound is not coming from the alternator as I fixed that problem a long time ago and this whine is 100% worst.  Also this sound even happends when I have the car running solely on battery  Any advise would be appreciated as I have exhausted all of my ideas.  Al"

324170,Terry,2009-03-30 22:21:00,14456,did you check if the antenna was connected
324172,ohhenrygsr,2009-03-30 22:23:00,947,"hey Al your problem is that you ran your Power, Remote wire, RCA or Speaker wires from the front of the car to the rear all on one side of the car.  You have to run Power and Remote wire on one side and the RCA or speaker wires on the other side.  The Power wire is interfering with the RCA wires that's why when you step on the gas you will notice that the whining sound will go with the engine's RPM.  Make sure you also have a solid ground to the body of the car."

324180,1Harringtona,2009-03-30 22:37:00,77,I have checked the wires at the back of the cd player. Also the wires like  I said in my first post I didnt have a problem with the whining from when I stepped on the gas as the whining happens before I even turn the car on.
324185,Fisherman,2009-03-30 22:44:00,7201,Maybe your hearing was also jarred after listening to the loud music while going over the manhole cover.
324186,DRIFTER_016,2009-03-30 22:44:00,10439,1st check the grounds. Is it an alternater type whine or is it a buzzing or crackling sound? It could be a number of things I would need to know what equipment is in the car.
324223,1Harringtona,2009-03-31 00:19:00,77,"After blowing two of my speakers with that whining(buzzing) noise I finally think I found out what was wrong, I was over loading the amp even though I had 3 subs and 4 speakers hooked up to it for a while now. So now I am left with 3 subs and 2 speakers  thanks for all the help anyways  PS. all of my equipment I have in the car is  1 Amp from xs cargo 3 subs from xs cargo 4 (now 2) speakers from wallmart  wiring kit (I think 8 gauge) from future shop"
