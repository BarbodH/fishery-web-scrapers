323925,hammercarp,2009-03-30 03:26:00,964,You asked for clarification Chukk I think it's pretty clear. If that page does not meet your standards I am sure there are others. No body said Afganis participated in that attack. Don't put words in others mouths or play games of deliberatly misquoting them.
323928,Dondorfish,2009-03-30 03:37:00,1000,"Hey Chukkk - like the bumper sticker, that I saw today , says :   If you don't stand behind our troops - feel free to stand in front of them!   Don  "
323933,ozaibak1,2009-03-30 04:03:00,401,"Supporting the troops means bringing them home from a war based on proven lies and deceit which is unjust. I respect the troops, which is why I would not like to see further Canadian lives wasted in an unwinnable war, Stephen Harper just said it today. The war is bankrupting our nation."
323941,Cookslav,2009-03-30 05:13:00,1457," Um...what? So Your saying the Taliban did not Harbour terrorists, Support massive opium & heroin supplies, and they don't support or spur MASSSIVE human rights retractions by say....Throwing dang Corrosive ACID on CHILDRENS Faces for simply going to School! Your saying the general public of Afghanistan wants us out, and the Taliban back in eh? Your saying we were not asked to join and extend our presence in this ""JOINT EFFORT"" as part of a NATO/U.N initiative to support this mission? What part are the lies? Please supply some credible links...enlighten to these lies. If the Taliban are wanted by Afghanistan citizens and are just generally nice civilized folk I think we should get the word out there.  These brave men and women of our armed forces are over there fighting with free will and believe in their cause...they lay down their lives for this, and you think the way to support them is to bring them home??? What your asking is a slap in the face to soldiers and the families of those who serve, and especially those who died. Ask them how they feel about it some time and I think you'll find your assumption is way off of where they stand...I know because I Have.  Its easy to be an armchair quarterback, and I suppose I'm no more an expert then you, but if you want them out ask yourself why? Is it because you support a Taliban rule in Afghanistan, or is it because you think its just not our fight? One is just wrong IMO, and the other is not only wrong, but Cowardice. A pull out leaves a horrible situation to fester...  We need to honor our commitment."
323967,chukkk,2009-03-30 11:49:00,57,"here's the real rub we have one guy from Kitchener and one guy from North Battleford who are fiercely supporting this unwinable war because they feel it's there obligation.  The guy from Kitchener can not seem to comprehend a sentence  as nowhere did I say people along the 401 did not support the troops. What I inferred was that corridor contained enough third world immigrants such as 250,000 tamil tigers to  wage a pretty good war in Canada.  The other pencil head from Saskatoon keeps calling me chuky in every other word  and assumes I come from somewhere other than Canada. My family goes back 4 generations in this country and they came from Britain before that.  Even our illustrious prime minister says this occupation is bankrupting the country.  Obama wants to pull out as well.  If the two patriots feel that strongly about protecting Canada from the Afghans why not sign up with the armed  services and go there. In other words what have you two patriotic Canadians done to help the cause .Besides run off at the mouths . Have you actually sent money to the government to support the war? Have you knitted socks for the troops?  Believe me I feel as bad for the families as you do. I have witnessed soldiers being loaded in body bags for a trip home and it is real easy to be patriots when your 10.000 miles from the nearest gun.  I went to South east Asia for two years and watched personnally many more Americans  than  what Canada has lost to date.  I don't beleive I said anything about the American population in General . I have  friends and relatives that live in the USA being a dual citizen (see Vietnam). I say that Bush and friends done a lot of damage to that country.  Finally you two guys  that will fall for anything ... try watching more than  CNN"

323338,lew,2009-03-28 21:43:00,12766,"Good that you were able to attend Joe, and sadly, this is something that's happening far too often lately."
323340,JohnF,2009-03-28 21:45:00,3494," That's a simple question with a complicated answer. There are many reasons why our young men and women do this war thing. - Because they want to make the world a better place - To live up to the expectations (or orders) of others - For the pay cheque - Because somebody has to do it - Because they come from a country whose citizens have higher expectations of what life should be like - As a stepping stone to a promotion in the military - To feed their sense of adventure - As an alternative to the way things are at home - to protect their home, family and country from the kind of trouble that so many of our world's countries experience each day  There are lots of reasons for it, some selfish, some altruistic, but generally it all boils down to one thing - as long as there are threats to our way of life, here and abroad, flawed as it may be, we're lucky that there are folks willing to step up, whatever their motivation.  This war stuff has been going on for years and years and years, the young and the able stepping up to defend our principles and to help our friends. We can only pray that the day will come when they won't have to put their lives on the line any longer. But don't hold yer breath.  Don't, like so many did during Vietnam, ever blame these young folks for the silliness of the politicians. Them we only suffer. They're our cross to bear. To those who fight we should show nothing but appreciation. They aren't accomplices. They don't make the wars. They just fight 'em.  God bless 'em and their families, whatever their motivation, and God forbid any of my grandchildren ever have to put themselves out there in harm's way.  JF"
323343,Mike the Pike,2009-03-28 21:53:00,3421,So sad indeed I was on the 401 once when the whole procession went by very moving indeed.  I wish our troops had much stronger vehicles to withstand these devastating blows.
323345,Jer,2009-03-28 21:55:00,1426,   ...well said...
323354,beertech,2009-03-28 22:06:00,118,passed the passing soldier today myself very sad to see. Know  a soldier who just got back. He mentioned that you can;t even describe what they go through over there. very brave indeed.
323358,ccmtcanada,2009-03-28 22:12:00,7971,"I was on the 401 heading east when the motorcade was heading west last week.  All traffic on my side had stopped...horns honked and then I saw something that was very powerful.  Out of the window of one of the bereaved family's cars, a single arm came out...hand balled into a fist and it pumped in the air a few times before it gave a wave of appreciation.  I'll never forget that sight."
323361,chukkk,2009-03-28 22:32:00,57,"I certainly feel bad for the parents and family's of these soldiers.  The only thing is I need a little clarification on why we are there in the first place . Is it because a bunch of Afghans plan on coming 10,000 miles to attack Canada and Canadians in there beds.  Maybe because of this boogy man  Al Quaeda  that was a small organization years ago and likely doesn't even exist anymore and if it does so what.  Oh maybe its because we don't want to be over run with third world agitators other than the hundreds of thousands of Tamils etc. demonstrating on a daily basis  in Toronto or the fact that 80% of the Toronto population is visible minority's.  Maybe we should run over and occupy Poland ... One of thier  people came here to vist his mother in Vancouver and our fearless mounties, four of them no less killed him with 5 jolts from a tazer because he allegedly threatened these guys armed with guns, pepper spray, batons and the Tazer . yep he picked up a stapler.  I wonder since the Afgahni culture has been around for thousands of years and we have been here under 200 we should be forcing our way of living on them. Who wouldn't want to pay car payments,mortgages , get laid of after 20 plus years of service to a company. Those Afghans don't know what they are missing.  Now before some brain boy comes on here and tells me better to fight them there  than here, just take a minute to think what the chances of that are realistically. There is enough of them here already to take over the country.  Like I said  John up the page had mosty of the reason correct. Things like  pay, advancement etc. but there is nothing patrotic about us occupying a country on the other side of the world  where 90% of the population doesn't want us anyway. Thats why you have kids  throwing rocks at the troops.  By the way I am a Canadian/US citizen  and I fought in Viet Nam another folley but I was young and thought they were going to come to North america if we didnt  stop them there. Now we have thousands of North Vietnamese in this country  and for the most part are fine contributors to society.  To our American fishing brothers  we love you coming here and I love the very good input to this forum. However he United States has  slipped very badly over the last few years  and I hope under President Obama it can get back to it's standing of being a friend to all countries in need. Unlike the fiasco in Iraq. That's my opinion"
323363,ozaibak1,2009-03-28 22:33:00,401," Wow, very well said on a delicate topic. I show appreciation for dedication to the country and its citizens to the soldiers serving when that is their intention. I show detest for any government that deceives its population as to the reasons for war. In my opinion there is never a 'good' reason for war, it's surprising how despite that it's always the 'last option' its always present throughout history, and will continue through imo. In the end I believe it is always about the real intention of the individual and the govt that determines their level of balance. RIP to all fallen soldiers defending what is dear to them and humanity."

323755,holdfast,2009-03-29 20:22:00,1813," Just Maybe Canada stepped up to the plate when the Government of Afghanistan asked the United Nations for help in securing its Country.  NATO Replyed with Canada, USA, and Britain taking the brunt.  Dont ever compare this war to Viet Nam.  Be proud that we still have young Men and Women willing to do the job that they are payed for.  There is not enough money in the world that would make me crawl on my belly, disarming an IED.  Maybe its something else.  Your so called bogyman is killing innocent people everyday in the most inhumane and hideous way.  The Explosive device. Just turn on the Pakistan news and read all the bombings.  That's only one Country of many.  Oh yea, if the USA did nothing about 9/11, how many other Idiots do you think would love to kill us, in the name of their Religion and/or hatred.  Don'T forget, Rwanda, and the Former Yugoslavia.  Remember. A Country either has its own military, if not , its someone else's.  Sad that our Soldiers are being killed by Booby Traps.  Must be 70 to 80 percent of the deaths by now.  What you should be peeved off is, there are so called Canadians in this Country that are secretly cheering the deaths of our Canadian Soldiers.  Are you one of them?"
323835,wallyboss,2009-03-30 00:00:00,1095,"Thanks Holdfast for explaining it in layman's terms,  I hope everybody will understand now.  We don't have to support the mission,  but we have the support the troops that are there on the mission."
323844,chukkk,2009-03-30 00:18:00,57," Come on Holdfast get a grip on reality. I love all your patriotic diatribe but lets face  it North Battleford, really now come down to the strip of Canada that runs from Windsor east to quebec where 1/3 of the population lives and you may get a wake up call. What Afghan government  asked the UN for help? Certainly not the one put there by the Afghanis.. Like I said I fougt against North Vietnamese  that were the boogey man  back then. Wasted dozens of them all for the name of Democracy and to keep them away from us. Geez i was fishing with a bunch of them north of Toronto today. Nicest people you want to meet.  As I said earlier there is enough of them (whoever they are)  in the country already to kill you and I.  So please save your righteous indignation for North Battleford. Like I said I fought for democracy once  and what a waste of time  much like the Afghan occupation."
323845,Northhunter,2009-03-30 00:22:00,214," Good post.  Our troops are making a difference in Afghanistan. Getting rid of the ""boogyman"" is one of the many things that are taking place over there. Too many people don't see the big picture."
323857,hammercarp,2009-03-30 00:58:00,964,People need to remember this. http://members.shaw.ca/kcic1/cdnwtc.html These are the Canadians that died in the 9/11 attacks. The terrorists the did this were trained in camps in Afganistan. We need to help the Afgan people achieve a stable gov't so that this does not happen again. We also have a commitment to help our neighbour when they are attacked. It doesn't matter that they have a huge military.  It's about who we are not what somebody else is. Our soldiers put their lives on the line to meet our commitments to our allies and to protect us. To the guy who asked about the terrorists in  Afganistan ever being able to harm people on the other side of the world from them the answer is yes they did and could again. It is not the same world it was in 1967.
323862,Zebco,2009-03-30 01:07:00,123,"I have total respect for our troops, they don't make the orders...  They fight and die for our way of life, God Bless them!   My question is why go to Afghanistan to fight them, when there are millions living in Toronto?  If Cockroaches infested my house I wouldn't start the extermination in the yard it would be in my house!"
323871,chukkk,2009-03-30 01:25:00,57,"Ah so now we find out the 911 situation was perpetrated by a bunch of Afghans thats news to me. Who says the terroists were trained in Afghanistan...CNN did and we always believe CNN.... the pilots were trained in Florida. Maybe the were there in Afghanistan  building weapons of Mass destruction for Iraq.. that came from the same intelligence .. really you guys are fine with your righteous idignation but the Afghans don't want us there, other than the handouts. I expect we could find more to do with 11 billion dollars like lower taxes on gas etc than to waste it yes waste it in afganistan.  By the  that Page you refered us to is an embarrasment to Canada it looks like it was made by a 3 year old who was brainwashed"
323889,pigeonfisher,2009-03-30 01:46:00,696,"Let's leave the ""You Guys"" stuff out of these conversations.  Generally, whenever you refer to someone as ""Them or You Guys"" it should be left out of what could otherwise be general conversation.  Even productive conversation if allowed to get there.  As a Canadian living in the US and enjoying the freedoms that both of our contries have allowed us I would graciously ask that y'all leave the border issue alone for a bit.  It has been burning on the site for a few weeks.  Borders are blind lines!  People have eyes and ears.  Use them.  Don't listen to ""The Border"".  You wonder why police exist?"
323901,Maverick,2009-03-30 02:05:00,371,"I actually bought a outboard off of a soldier on CFB Petawawa this weekend. He was promoted with one of the soldiers that died just recently with the 4 from CFB Petawawa. The younger kid, 18, was a replacement and had only been there for 3 or 4 weeks and his father had just filled out the release forms.  We were chatting about it and he said ""Like I tell my family, I don't work at Walmart"". He said that the families really have a tough time, just as bad as the soldiers, with PTSD which makes sense but I had never thought. They built a big building for the families up on base there.  He was wounded during that friendly fire where the an aircraft shot and injured 30-some soldiers. He is on his way back soon too. From the people that I know and I have talked to that have been over there and fought, the general consensus is that they want to finish the fight. They know and accept the risks involved but they want to help the afgani people and finish the war.  I have the utmost respect for these individuals who serve our country and wish them all a safe return, it's sad that they all won't though."
323903,chukkk,2009-03-30 02:08:00,57," And this statement makes any sense ""how""  However I will say most of the US border guards that I have run into ar on a massive ego trip and in case you haven't noticed ""you guys' namely the United States Of America  is not the most popular country in the world ....Weapons of Mass destruction  ...yeah right"
323909,holdfast,2009-03-30 02:22:00,1813," Then your living in the wrong Country.  If you dont like it , GET OUT.  Oh yea heres some History for you  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Cut_Knife"
323912,JohnF,2009-03-30 02:30:00,3494," Some of us have very good friends from south of the border, and we know that they're at least as good at the humanity game as us Canucks. Perhaps that familiarity makes us feel like we are entitled to stick it to them occasionally but that doesn't mean we disrespect them. It's just a buddy thang.  We've all had our problems with border types. Personally, my worst run-ins have been with our own Canadian guys - well, other than the guy who .... well, never mind. That's a story for another time, but I assure you, the dude didn't really mean to shoot me, and perhaps we were a tad out of line. Four guys on their way to a Nascar event can be kinda unruly after 3 hours on the road in a motorhome on a Friday evening after a tough week at work.  JF"
323913,Cookslav,2009-03-30 02:35:00,1457,"  Wow....and people wonder why most of Canada has a ""stigma"" about Torontarians, and folks from Ontario. I'd suggest you leave the 1/3rd debate out of this and speak for yourself.  I live in this 401 corridor, and can safely say almost everyone I know supports our troops AND their mission. Why? Cause we said we'd go, and finish the job....its that simple We gave our word, and we are nothing with out it. Our word is what makes us respected in this world. Our word crosses the borders, and goes beyond the limits of foreign culture. Your word is your bond...we gave ours to people in need, and we should be there until we are no longer needed regardless of the cost because we said we would. You still disagree? Go talk to the family of Tyler...ask 'em what they think we should do...  Should we turn around with our tails between our legs, and make his sacrifice for nothing? So you think that’s what he would have wanted? What about his family, his friends and his unit?  What about the young girls who have Acid thrown in their faces because they simply went to school that day?  Any one against our involvement in this needs to re-evaluate their position on suffering & tyranny. grow a pair and stand up for something that is right, and stop undermining what our troops are doing.  Just cause it happens in another country doesn't make it right to turn a blind eye when people are crying for help."
