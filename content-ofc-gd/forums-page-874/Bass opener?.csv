323413,Guest skeeter99,2009-03-29 00:57:00,0, third saturday in june?  no it is the 4 th saturday in june for central and southern ontario south of new liskeard **roughly**   I usually hits lakes north of new liskeard in early may zone 8  (open all year up there) they have lakes just stocked with bass and the fishing is absolutely phenominal

323416,Terry,2009-03-29 01:00:00,14456,I really really really really believe that people should know how to read the regs and read the regs before they are allowed to pick up a fishing rod here is a link to the regs to help you on your quest  there will be a test after  http://www.mnr.gov.on.ca/en/Business/LetsF...L02_163615.html   ok I am kidding about the test           or am I....LOL
323419,MarcusDiGiovanni,2009-03-29 01:03:00,182,hehe
323420,BillM,2009-03-29 01:05:00,17367,"And this is why you read the regs and not some dude on a fishing forum  3rd week, 4th week, it's all the same! lol"
323421,MarcusDiGiovanni,2009-03-29 01:06:00,182,"hahahaha, , lesson learned"
323422,Cudz,2009-03-29 01:07:00,2652,3rd week is better fishing.  lol
323446,uglyfish,2009-03-29 03:28:00,981,"june 27 is opener. but really, learn the read the regs... may save u thousands in fines one day"
323674,Beans,2009-03-29 16:33:00,3339,Most Bait and Tackle Stores have free paper copies of the regulations...pick up a copy...
323677,irishfield,2009-03-29 16:37:00,26272,Open bass year round and get rid of the need to read.
323679,Guest gbfisher,2009-03-29 16:40:00,0,   I think it would be great as well Terry...but we all know how backasswards any regs or good books for that matter get interpreted.....  Long ways off for them Green Carps..Lots of good fish to catch until then though. Not that I'd fish for them myself but.....incidentally they're ok!!...
324012,charlesn,2009-03-30 14:42:00,551,"They're open year round on Lake Erie (and other inland lakes) on the NY side for those with less patience.  A NY non-res license is $40 or so for the year.  I read it might be going up to $70 or $80 on a NY based forum, but what can you do, I'll still pay it to not have to wait til late June.  Harmonizing the regulations would probably earn the Canadian businesses on Erie some extra money.  I'd say 70% of the boats I see at the US launches in the spring are from Ontario."
