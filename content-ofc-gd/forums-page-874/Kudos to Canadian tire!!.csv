323782,Radnine,2009-03-29 21:34:00,1538,"A thumbs up   from me to two Canadian institutions: Canadian Tire and the CAA. I changed the tires this weekend from snows to summers (I have two sets of rims) and on the way out of my driveway ran over a flamin' nail that punctured one of my brand new tires. So I awoke this morning knowing that I could pump the tire using the on-board compressor of my Montana, which I did. The problem is that I killed the battery as I failed to start the engine as I did so (ran the compressor off of the battery). Enter the CAA; They showed up within 15 minutes of me calling and got me going so that I could run to Canadian Tire, where they fixed the puncture in the tire or free (the main reason I buy tires there. It works everywhere.). CT gets slagged loads here (and usually rightly so) but I'm here to tell you that all is well at the Caledonia branch! Jim While I am in a good mood, how great is it to see Tiger on TV and in contention again?"
323790,irishfield,2009-03-29 22:00:00,26272,Amazed CTC plugged a tire... against(or at least was against) their policy even though they sell them in the store.
