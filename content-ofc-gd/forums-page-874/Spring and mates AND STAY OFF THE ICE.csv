As for the spring and mates Thier starting to pair up. Love is in the air.          These teo poor fellas are still looking.       I found a friend that wanted to play peek a boo on the tree.LOL    I finally tagged him out.  "

The temperature was 15 C and the lake was like glass, not a wave around. The bottom of lake was quite visible. Water is quite clear. Can't wait to start the fishing season. As you can see the ice already gone.

I wouldn't be caught dead on Superior at this time of year, but there's still well over a month of ice action on the inland lakes up here. Be careful out there guys. Common sense goes a long way.  "
