323752,fishinfool,2009-03-29 20:13:00,366,Every year I ask for this site so that I can see how the ice is doing on Balsam and I need it again this year. Anyone recall the site. Much appreciated. (Again!)  Stan
323756,ccmtcanada,2009-03-29 20:22:00,7971,You mean site?  http://coastwatch.glerl.noaa.gov/modis/mod...on=o&page=1
323772,fishinfool,2009-03-29 21:04:00,366, That's the one. Thanks Cliff  Stan
323961,fishboy,2009-03-30 10:54:00,550,ahhh-the ice-out watch begins in earnest!
323966,Basskicker,2009-03-30 11:41:00,421,This is the one I use......good for most of the world.  http://rapidfire.sci.gsfc.nasa.gov/subsets...9087.terra.250m
323977,Jer,2009-03-30 12:56:00,1426,"Early ice-out this year around here (except for Balsam apparently).  Upper Buckhorn is more or less ice free (except for my bay which is just waiting for a good SW wind to blow it out).     Just a few minutes ago...it's hard to see the ice line but anything beyond the island is open water.  Very unusual for it to be gone in March, especially since it was rather thick this year as well.  Is this good or bad for crappie fishing still almost four weeks away?"
323978,Kawartha Kev,2009-03-30 13:05:00,281,Check out the webcam from Reach Harbour on Lower Buckhorn and you can see that it is also open water except for the back bays here is a link can't wait to get up to the cottage!!  Lower Buckhorn Webcam  Kawartha Kev
323981,Jer,2009-03-30 13:17:00,1426,...and now it's snowing...
324184,Sinker,2009-03-30 22:44:00,8692,"The open water is going to warm faster than usual that's for sure. Whether that's a good thing or not, I""m not sure. I find I do good for crappies when its a bit of an early ice out, but do best for eyes on a late ice out.  Crappies could be anywhere in a months time.  I know one thing for sure......its going to be a loooooong month of in between season.  Sinker"
