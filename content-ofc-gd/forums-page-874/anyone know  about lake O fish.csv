I tried  gulp minnows  and everything else  like lures, jigs etc and never got a nibble. This parade kept up for a couple of hours .  Would these be trout and what is the best method to catch them . The water was clear  for several feet down.  Any suggestions would be most welcome"

323552,chukkk,2009-03-29 12:56:00,57,Thanks Spiel ...That is a distinct possibility as I had the sensitivity set to high as I was trying to see my lure . Yes it does have the fancy little fish symbols  and  that is the closest thing I saw to a fish all day. It is a Humminbird x717 fish finder
323963,Spiel,2009-03-30 11:19:00,9065,"Chukkk if you're running the the graph with those little fish symbols the first thing you need to do is turn 'em off, they're meaningless! With that done it's time to adjust the sensitivity, you can in most cases set it up high enough to see the lure but with the fish I.D off you'll learn to differentiate what is fish, noise clutter and bait."
323973,chukkk,2009-03-30 12:28:00,57,Thanks very much for your help spiel.. I have just got back into fishing  after a lifetime of working. I have all the toys plus some that I really don't need but I'm sure we all do. Thanks to help like yours I am learning. This forum is standard for me on a daily basis and it is amazing what you can learn here especially by just asking for help.  I will take your advice on the fish finder in fact I will have to go right this afternoon (lol) to try it out  Thanks again
