324099,Roy,2009-03-30 19:50:00,13728,"There's nothing wrong with members starting their own boards at all. Fishing for members on someone elses' board is a little delicate but hey, knock yourself out.  It is kinda weird that members who are joining that board have very seldom posted a pike thread on our board. One in particular has been here since 2006 and has post a total of ONE pike thread.  Anyhow, best of luck to you."
