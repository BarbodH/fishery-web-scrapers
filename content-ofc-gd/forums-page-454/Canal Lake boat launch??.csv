653368,Locnar,2012-01-04 23:09:00,645,"I was wondering if anyone knew where the boat launch(es) is on Canal Lake. Another quick question, anyone ever gone ice fishing on Canal Lake? I am aware that there is a strong currant, probably makes the ice a bit sketchier."
653462,Kerry,2012-01-05 04:06:00,383, There is one on Centennial Dr or Road between Hwy 48 and Simcoe rd 46.Not sure what the ice conditions are in the area though. Kerry
653557,Locnar,2012-01-05 14:48:00,645," Hmm, so the one on Centennial, is it on the north side of the lake?"
653567,Dave Bailey,2012-01-05 15:10:00,1641," Yup, it is."
653666,Locnar,2012-01-05 19:34:00,645," Right on, thanks guys. That one he mentioned dealing with Country rd 46 and 48... would that be on Macintye rd or paradise rd? The map seems to say 2 names for the same street..."
653796,Kerry,2012-01-06 01:15:00,383,No Centennial actually goes between the two.I think paradise rd is a little closer to kirkfield.Centennial actually cuts Canal in half if you are looking at a map.The bridge that it runs over the lake is called the 'hole in the wall'.  Kerry
653809,baironhorse,2012-01-06 01:39:00,145,ice not ready..weather too mild....launch...sunset cover marina and off centinenal park drive...marina launch is better especially with fluctuating water levels
