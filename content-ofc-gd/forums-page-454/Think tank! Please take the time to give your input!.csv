653570,Skipper D,2012-01-05 15:18:00,1970,"Maybe theres the answer , maybe once we know how many we have in the group we aproch one of thease big companys who are allready in buisness and see if they would cater to us by giving us the discount , does this sound like some thing duable . I think thats a very simple way ."
653585,scugpg,2012-01-05 15:47:00,1373, That is a good idea. Something like pay a membership fee and have authentic OFC membership cards or discount number to provide when purchasing.
653591,TJQ,2012-01-05 16:08:00,7806,"This is all well and good, Ive been through the OFC discount scenario before, main problem is who administers it, im all for discounts and all, but the administration of this is time consuming, what happens with returns?? etc... Theres a reason that stores make 40 percent, to cover costs of doing business. Who ever takes this on wont find it ""fun"" for long."
653667,craigdritchie,2012-01-05 19:34:00,1586,"Nice ideas, but I think y'all would be better off approaching an existing internet or mail-order retailer and seeing about working out some sort of group discount - call it an OFC loyalty program of some sort.  I think most here would choke upon seeing the real, actual costs of setting this sort of business operation."
653675,JTorra,2012-01-05 19:57:00,50,"This is not a new idea.... I'm sure you've all heard of the ""deal a day"" websites. Groupon, Living Social, TeamBuy (were on Dragon's Den) This concept went crazy about a year ago. http://groupbuyingcanada.com/canada-goes-crazy-for-group-buying-daily-deals/  What is being proposed is a bit different, but still involves the ""group buying"" concept. Some retailers love it as advertising (as mentioned, the ""loss-leader"" concept) and others will hate the idea of giving away margin.  It is definitely doable if thought out properly. It would have to be a ""daily deal"" site geared specifically to outdoor gear and successfully attract retailers to offer up deals as a way of getting their products used by more people. There are already man-specific http://www.groupdudes.com/ and women specific versions of these.  If someone wants to start one up I'm in as member!

653921,singingdog,2012-01-06 11:30:00,1047,"Not a new idea at all: Mountain Equipment Coop and REI in the states are run on almost exactly the same model you are talking about. If you are serious, you should talk to someone on the board at MEC.....it all started with some backpackers having a conversation very similar to this thread.  A few things to think about: 1. Becoming, and maintaining a not-for-profit organisation is not easy. The requirements for organisation and operation are fairly strict and very time consuming to govern and administer. 2 Anyone that thinks that outdoor retailers are consistently getting 400% margin is living in an alternate reality. 40% margin (less than double wholesale price) is typical. 50% margin (double wholesale price) is good. Check the prices on the MEC website: they are typically running somewhere around 35% margin, which generates little or no profit. They have the buying power of 3.3 million members.  The amount of buying power that the membership of this board would generate may get you past a sales rep and directly to the distributor. I seriously doubt it is going to get you dealing directly with the manufacturer."
653946,radar,2012-01-06 13:45:00,138,"Why not keep it real simple. If someone wants something (rod, reel, sonar....) maybe they can arrange a bulk rate and offer it to OFC. Maybe they can get their's for free or real cheap. There are already a few people who do this on the board for plastics, rods, charters etc.  Maybe a list of suppliers could work. To keep it spam free it goes into classifieds.  I'm not a regular, but most of you are and could pm each other about deals and direct people to classifieds.  Not really what Cliff's original idea was, but could still work."

And yes, from all the reports I got back on it, it will also be a big sucess. In fact I am now in talks with a major retailer to handle the product but more to follow on that in a few weeks. This is a totally different concept and not product specific related. Just an old man trying to find ways to help his friends!"
653418,cynmar,2012-01-05 01:40:00,169,"I like the idea however, let's try and keep it as simple as possible. Manufacturing firms like high volume numbers but I don't see the necessity of holding inventory. For example, I'm sure if you approach a vendor and say we as a group have 5000 members , we want a percentage above cost on all your items and we'll send our business your way. Your're not holding any inventory, or any of the hassels, just get a commitment on items sold to OFC members and would need a commitment on the part of members to buy from these guys. As the numbers build up, better discounts are garnered. Basically asking for tenders to provide rods and reels to OFC members.  Bill"

653427,Skud,2012-01-05 02:00:00,739,"Yes, OFC has many members now. A hand full of them spend way to much money on gear and would be into your concept of purchasing. Most members do not spend a lot of dough on there hobby. You could not get 5000 members buying the same product constantly. The numbers wouldn't be there to convince a manufacturer to sell direct."
653432,Fish Farmer,2012-01-05 02:23:00,2234,"I like to save and get a deal like the next guy. I'm not a business man, but I have a few friends that are. Sometimes you see a great deal on 1 item in a store , it's called a lost-leader, meaning, to get you into the store and buy more than the 1 item It's a good idea Cliff. But you buy 500 to get a good deal and maybe only sell 2 of those items, who's the guy holding the bag. Just an example: CD players were new on the market and 2 years later, you can't buy one(out of date). Times are moving to fast. Fish Finders are the same, I bought one this year and already it's an antique.  Stores don't keep a big stock anymore. And what about the little tackle shop guy trying to make a living. If this was the way things should be sold, it could spell a disaster for the little guy. Just saying Cliff."

653508,grimsbylander,2012-01-05 12:44:00,3016,"  Phil is absolutely correct with reference to the challenges and road blocks. I don't see this as impossible, but with the vast amount of variables it would be full time work for one or more people to run. There has been a number of examples given regarding large margin markups and they do exist but certainly not across the board and sporting goods can be very tight.  For example, my family owned a archery shop years ago and numerous times, the large sporting goods store in Mississauga was selling bows for less than we could buy them for. And not once in a while as a lost leader...consistantly. Simple volume based buying power. The big store in Vaughn gets 5000 people through by 9am Saturday morning and they negociate their purchase prices based on all their stores.  I still think it could work if pursued, I'm just saying the work level, finances, risk, etc. would be the same as any other business start up and there are enough self employeed people on this site to tell you, it is an incredible amount of effort. My 2 cents...  Dave"
653509,gordy28,2012-01-05 12:46:00,638,"Being relatively new to the forum I almost feel foolish jumping in-but the concept is too ineresting not to; Few thoughts; For my work I have followed the Wag Jag/Group On trend quote closely.  Generally I hear:  great for consumers but not so great for the retailer/business.  The basic premise is to use Wag Jagz reach (number of emails) they can go to to generate store sales.  The challenge is there are requirements for how big the discount may be etc.  And most retailers end up giving up most/all profit on the idea that someone comes in for the really cheap stuff, and buy more (loss leaders as someone mentioned) challenge is that most poeple don't return-they just wait for the next sale from the same or similar retailer This idea is different to me and better.  You are saying use the size of OFC to create ongoing offers for retailers but ideally prices set are good but not at a loss to a retailer  Per somone elses idea to me the best concept is the idea like; OK OFNers deal of the month/week is Shimano Compre Spinning ros for 20% of the retail price if we as a group buy 100 rods.  Rods available for pick up at these 3 locatios etc or shipped for $x  That way you aren't storing inventory or having a large cash outlay to buy ahead  Anyway great idea and I will watch with interet (I'm in the market for a new rod, reel and a fish finder )"

In my opinion the manufactures should not be selling to anybody but a distributer, if we cut out the middle man it means peoples jobs are taken away from them. I know we would be getting the goods for less, but in my opinion it should follow the proper chain.  just my 2 cents"
653543,bubbles,2012-01-05 14:13:00,591,"I appreciate the concept and have executed the same thing but was dealing with millions of dollars among companies as opposed to individuals.  I think it would be a struggle at best, and a nightmare to administer.  You would be hard pressed to get manufacturers interested, while you may think talking 500 propane tanks is an impressive number think of the number that CTC or Cosco buys..... if you are not going to inventory anything than how do I get my tank when I need one if the co-op made it's purchase 3 months ago and everyone bought enough to last them a year or more?  No manufactureris going to be your warehouse, they have distribution channel to market for that.  Just my 1 1/2 cents"
653562,LesCulpJr,2012-01-05 14:52:00,75,"Pick your brands and stick with them... For a manufacturer to deal with you directly they'll want to know they own that part of the market(the membership of this site will not be big enough for a large manufacturer)...However. Manufacturers often sign deals with distributers, giving the firm sole distribution rights of a product (or list of products)within a given area. The Manufacturer may get away with selling the odd shipment of non current product to another firm. But otherwise are subject to legal action for violating the contract.Expect this with any offshore or international firm as there usually are distributers awarded sole distribution for the entire country.  As for smaller (growing) manufacturers they often need distributers to bring their products to market, so they kinda got ya over a barrel whether your the maker or the end user. Their all the devil in my eyes (distributers) and drive prices through the roof. But they do serve a purpose:)  Good Luck. you've certainly got alot of interest here:)"
653566,bigbuck,2012-01-05 15:07:00,2449,"There is definitely a lot involved with starting something like this up. Warehousing isn't a huge expense, it will be one of the cheaper expenditures. Insurance would probably end up being a big cost. I like the idea and would support it if I could in any way. I think the manufacturers themselves wouldn't give you the time of day, it would be the distributors of the various lines of products. The distribution of the various products offered would be a nightmare at your end. Ontario is a big place and fuel and/or shipping costs would have to be factored into someone's buying decisions. While the drive to Lindsay is nice, I'm not spending $50-60 to save $20 or 30. If it's a big ticket item and I'm saving $150+, I'd consider it. But how many big ticket items like that will we be buying on a regular basis and how will it end up being worthwhile for those who are running it. I'm not a believer in free labour, everybody deserves to get paid for their efforts. Once all costs get factored in, is it really worth the effort?? Now, that said, good luck. I know you retired Cliff several times and get ants in your pants, one of my colleagues finally retired for the last time at 78 after retiring 3 times. You have to keep yourself busy, my mentor is still at it and he's going to be 79 this year and still works 40-50 hours a week (he's slowed down, it used to be close to 75-80 hrs/wk, the price paid of being a business owner)."
653336,Big Cliff,2012-01-04 22:04:00,6899,"Here is my thinking, might need a little modification but it's a place to start.  We are a group of anglers and hunters for the most part and many of us shop the sales on products. What if we were to start a co-op and start to contact manufacturers directly through that co-op.  Here is an example; if I want to buy Coleman propane cylinders I have to shop the sales or end up paying full retail price. Now we all know that the retailer is not paying anything close to what they sell it to us for and Coleman wouldn't give us a deal as an individual on those cylinders but what if we had an order for 100, 1000, ""10,000""? (that is only about 1.5 cylinders for every person on this board) do you think they would talk to us then? The same holds true for many products and as a group we could all work together to help each other.  We have a wonderful wealth of knowledge available on this board, people with strong business, sales, marketing and customer service back grounds, web design and so much more. I already know people that could/would be very happy to act as distribution centers in both Ontario and Quebec.  Now, I would propose that it get run as a non profit type of thing (naturally we couldn't sell everything at cost as we would have some overhead to cover but we could do a really good job of saving us all a lot of money with any profits made after costs were covered going back to the members).  The primary focus would be on North American Manufactured products but not limited too or excluding any others.  This could also be extended to many other areas, Lodges, fishing charters, baits and tackle, the list is endless and I have a lot of very good contacts in the outdoors markets that I know would be more than happy to deal with us.  So, any thoughts, ideas (good or bad) would be appreciated!"
653341,Rod Caster,2012-01-04 22:15:00,5784,"I really like the idea of using our collaborative powers towards lodges/charters... ""OFC approved"" lodges that offer a discount in exchange for clientel off this board. On the other hand, as a group we can't seem to agree on much so it might be a hard sell to get people interested specific products.  Either way, this seems like a worthwhile initiative, Cliff."
653345,Gerritt,2012-01-04 22:26:00,6129,"I understand the concept, but where would the start up capitol come from? most suppliers offer terms of 15-60 days, with most being 30days. would this be a system of prepayment to secure said goods? Membership fees perhaps? the list of questions is endless. I like the idea, but would need more info on the inner workings before being able to say if it is good for the community or not.  Sounds very much like a Wagjag concept to me... which actually works quite well for those that buy into the offers.  G."

653349,Roy,2012-01-04 22:37:00,13728,"That would be a huge cash outlay. Warehousing is no cheapie either. Neither is security and insurance. Take your example of propane cylinders. Where would you store 1000/5000 propane cylinders? How much is shipping on propane per cylinder? Realistically, you couldn't save anyone enough to make it worth their while ordering these things. There are many good reasons why it would work but many more reasons why it would not."

653376,radar,2012-01-04 23:23:00,138,"Direct from wholesaler or retailer with a promise of a bulk purchase could work.  For example - contact Coleman and say we have 35 guys who want a Coleman stove. Ask what is the best rate you can give?. Let the salesmen offer you some other items. Maybe they come back and say - ok if 45 of you want it we will give this rate. Its kinda like the way these group coupon discounts deals work.  There doesn't necessarily need to be an investment in inventory. There would be a point man to gather the cash from board members. Pay in advance. Once enough people have paid the stuff is purchased. All the supplier wants is one cheque.  Could work for rods, reels, lodges meals etc. (too bad beer store wouldn't work)  Maybe TJ could get a cut and an OFC stamp of approval could be a marketing tool.  There are some logistics like - where is the cash collected and how is the inventory distributed."

Those already owning bussinesses could have corporate membership. Basically, like Costco."

After a number of refills, the 1 lb tanks don't ""work"" all that well, kinda sorta leaky, so then you need to buy more 1 lb tanks.  Maybe just easier to buy a 5lb and it's good for 10 years, refill mine at Costco for $3.00."

My two cents....  1 - It naturally works better for services, lodging, etc.  No costs for shipping,warehousing, etc.  Also, when a lodge or service company misses a day of service, that revenue is gone forever with no chance of recouping (at least without a time machine) so maybe more motivation to cut deals on slow times in the year.  2 - for actual products, would be better on those that ship direct from the manufacturer so that you don't need to deal with shipping, warehousing, returns, etc.  With that in mind, it works best on higher-cost, smaller/easier to ship items.   For example, the retailer margin on a $70 coleman stove might not be enough savings to justify the shipping expense and hassle overall, but what about a HDS fishfinder?  Expensive (more margin), and relatively small/easy to ship."

Even a product at 50% off can offer a margin of profit. For instance, I purchase shrubs in 1 gallon pots, or yard ornaments at .99 each from the west coast. In turn, I sell these items from $5.99 to $8.99. This enables me to cover my purchase, plus shipping, plus taxes, and still have a 250% margin on my purchase price. Every retailer does the exact same thing. Biggest hurdles are warehousing and distribution after having purchased a bulk product. The supplier will only want one point of delivery unless the multiple POD's met a delivery minimum. In selling floral product direct to Lowes, Home Depot, Sams Clubs, there was a minimum case count or dollar value per store. From the POD the big challenge is in effectively and economically getting product to the members."

Example, in my bussiness, i buy most of my bake elements for 7.75, sell them wholesale for 12.95 and retail them for 30 bucks. No matter how you look at it, there is a ton of money to be saved. Cliff, i will sell to the co-op cost plus 25 percent, with 60 day terms."
