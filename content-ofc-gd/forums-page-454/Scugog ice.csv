653928,gotfish,2012-01-06 12:15:00,53,The ice seems to be ok out from Caesarea pier and east. West of the pier around the deep hole there has been open water as of a few days ago. That area might have a light skim of ice on it and still unstable. Straight out from the pier is good for about 150yrs. About half way from the peir to washburn there was a small openning about half football field on tues. The washburn to ball point and east stretch around channel markers I would stay away from completely. It was open as late as tuesday and will be affected by the current the most. For those heading Veiw lake area do not get close to the channel on the north side by the markers. That area always has unstable ice even in the best of winters.  Cheers AL
