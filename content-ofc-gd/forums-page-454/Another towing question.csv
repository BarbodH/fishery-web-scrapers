653930,DanD,2012-01-06 12:27:00,2223,Fisherman Fisherman Fisherman you are an extremist Sir. I said a weight distribution hitch would transfer SOME weight to the front. I didn’t tell him to jack the back end up like some redneck with their street rod.  I do agree that a mini van might have some issues stopping in a panic situation; but a trailer equipped with brakes would quickly rectify that. It would be something to keep in mind when buying new rig. Yes both the hitch and a trailer equipped with surge brakes are a lot more money then standard ones; but still nowhere as much as a replacement tow vehicle would cost. Other then the strain on the drivetrain; I'd go anywhere with that set-up.  Dan.
653934,lew,2012-01-06 12:52:00,12766, That actually happened to a fella I used to work with Dan.  He bought a house trailer with a weight distribution hitch but never asked anyone how to set it up properly. He hauled it to Vancouver for a vacation and had to replace the front tires on his car when he got there.  He said the steering felt funny all the way across the country but he never thought to ask anyone why
653948,smally21,2012-01-06 13:49:00,993,"To the OP, lots of people tow small boats with minivans, and find their way up a down a half decent boat ramp. its legal, within the specs, doesn't catch the eye as being bizarre and likely to get stopped, and minivans are reasonably heavy, well powered vehicles. most of the guys i dealt with drove full size trucks, but also generally dealt with larger boats.  a 4WD pickup truck in low gear can solve a lot of problems, and dropping the boat off the end of the ramp as mentioned earlier is one of the worst. kind of thing tough to overcome with FWD vehicles. an inspection of the ramp prior to use is a good idea. sounds like you are familiar with this one which is good. your trailer is not going to have brakes and from the flavour of your original post i doubt you're going to spend hundreds of dollars to add them just to drive a short distance. WDH have their place for sure, but aren't some sort of cure all cant turn a honda civic into an F350 if you know what i mean..  as its been brought up already, one of the things i heard all the time when talking to customers and consulting on their towing needs was ""i dont have far to go"". the other one i heard all the time was ""i only use it twice a year""  i understand in your case we are talkng 3kms down a quiet road, so im not really talking about OP here..  while the intention for the guy on the phone is just to get his boat out of the water at the end of the year or visit uncle berts cottage that is only down the road ill say a couple of things.  -the boat weighs what it weighs no matter how far or how often you tow -a vicious set of train tracks will cause damage and dont care how long you are towing the boar for -panic stops can occur anywhere -police and the MTO can be anywhere -once you start towing your boat you will find other reasons to tow it, the cottage, a G2G, tournament, to the marina for repair, etc. -any shortcuts taken in the sourcing or purchasing of the trailer will come back to haunt you on resale    just responding to some comments made earlier, the rig should be appropriate to the load and law, and common sense, regardless of use or towing habits.  one of the comments we used to make when looking at a tow package ""if it looks like a dog humping a whale, its probably not right"""
653951,Fisherman,2012-01-06 13:55:00,7201," Extremist, not quite, realist more like it. There's a lot of people out there that would run out and buy a WDH and ""crank her up"" and ride around with the back tires off the ground.  Again I don't think the OPs trailer has brakes, however, not required under 3K.  But after seeing a WDH for a Dodge caravan that doesn't have much of a frame, mostly unibody if I'm not mistaken, I also found this this, which I'm sure a lot of people would like to see in action: Dodge Grand-Caravan 5th Wheel Hitches Dodge Grand-Caravan Gooseneck Hitches  Available here: http://www.autoanything.com/towing/Dodge/Grand-Caravan/110A50740A0A0A23A283A1.aspx"
653969,smally21,2012-01-06 14:36:00,993,"5th wheel on a caravan - awesome! i wish i could find the pics, an astrovan pulling a 38' houseboat we built - but only for a short distance  a customer pulled up to my shop to pick up his 12,000 lb tandem it was 34' long - driving a ford escort. the improvised hitch was tied to the undercarriage and bumper...  it was awesome wouldn't let him take it til he came back with his truck!"

654106,Freshtrax,2012-01-06 21:19:00,2215,I would check your towing spec's again my carolla is rated to tow 1500 pounds.  Maby you just need a higher class hitch installed
654110,Freshtrax,2012-01-06 21:25:00,2215,Silly me. I read on and found out you already did that.  I towed a tent trailer from to toronto to vancover and back in four weeks had no problems. That van lasted to 500k. ( Mercury villiager). Good van on a side note i miss it.
653533,sneak_e_pete,2012-01-05 13:54:00,540,"Hello again...lots of questions...these days...just excited I guess.  I posted a while ago about a tow vehicle and got a lot of valuable advice, however I have 1 more question.  I want a new boat in the next 1-2 years, but would like to avoid buying a truck for several more years.  I currently own a Dodge Grand Caravan (towing capacity 1,500 lbs.).  My family has a trailer near Dunville, and the boat launch is literally 3 kms down the road and is relatively flat.  I could store the boat at my trailer and launch each time I want to use it.  Do you anticipate any real problems towing it on a regular basis to that launch and launching/pulling it out?  I definitely want to avoid buying a boat and not being able to use it.  Thanks for your input."
653544,bubbles,2012-01-05 14:16:00,591,"Boat.....that is a huge variable.  Need a little more definition.  A 14' alluminum for some fishing - no problem, a 32' cruiser, nope."
653546,sneak_e_pete,2012-01-05 14:24:00,540,"Good point...17-18 footer...92-96 inch beam.  I am guessing total package weight of 2,500-2,700 lbs."
653549,Rattletrap2,2012-01-05 14:32:00,1652,"Based on your prospective boat from your other post, I would say, no problem! That short distance combined with the relatively few times you woud be towing should be fine. I did it with a much heavier boat than you are looking at and even towed it back and forth between the camp and home a couple of trips per year."
653551,bubbles,2012-01-05 14:36:00,591,"Well based on your posts you are asking if you can tow something that weighs 2600 lbs with a vehicle that is rated to pull 1500.....  Having said that, I have seen more than one Honda Civic pulling boats out at the launch and I am sure they are rated at about 50Lbs towing capacity.  You wont be doing the van any favours but you should be fine."
653586,Flappn,2012-01-05 15:51:00,245,I tow my boat about 2km (From the trailer to the boat launch) with my wife's RAV4 4 cylinder and the boat package weighs in at just over 2K. I think you will be ok if your Going a short distance.
653625,lew,2012-01-05 17:27:00,12766,First thing that came to my mind was what happens with your insurance coverage if you have an accident while your towing a 2600 pound boat with a vehicle rated to tow 1500 pounds.  Just a thought...
653633,Billy Bob,2012-01-05 17:43:00,5865,"All fishing boats should be towed with a big, strong and dependable Toyota TUNDRA pickup truck...Silver is the preferred color....LOL....   I don't think you will have any problems going that short of a distance.   Good Luck, Bob"
653645,captpierre,2012-01-05 18:12:00,2521,"Really need to talk to your insurance rep.  May not cover you if you're in an accident if you tow beyond rating of veheicle.  Secondly, start saving for a new transmission on the Caravan"
653658,Billy Bob,2012-01-05 19:15:00,5865," I don't know it that is true or not....but I'm leaning NOT....if you think about it then almost every ""accident"" would be denied for one reason or another....you went thru a stop sign....you were speeding....you were driving without the proper caution for the weather conditions that day....the list could go on and on.  My son is a insurance underwriter....next time he's home (next weekend) if I remember I'll have to ask him about something like this.  Bob"
653703,captpierre,2012-01-05 21:34:00,2521,"I know the insurance underwriters have a ""stupid factor"" built into policies -like when you wire your own  house incorrectly and cause a fire.  But if there is a significant claim and they don't want to pay, they start looking at the fine print.  Like if you lied about your driving activity as in whether for work or pleasure.  Best to ask the agent dealing with the policy"
653721,Billy Bob,2012-01-05 22:20:00,5865,"Now that's a good one....they are like asking your car salesmen how much you vehicle can tow....  Insurance agents are good for one thing and only one thing....take money from you, take a cut of said money for themselves and pass the rest onto the insurance company."
653723,DanD,2012-01-05 22:21:00,2223,"You’ll be working that van but with care it should get you to the ramp ok; my concern would be, will it pull the boat out and up the ramp? Not just power wise; but traction; with all that weight on the rear, will the front drive wheels have enough weight on them not to just spin out easily? I guess if it does turn into an issue, you could install a weight distribution hitch. That would transfer some of the weight back onto the front of the vehicle.  Dan. "

653733,aplumma,2012-01-05 22:42:00,6896,It is not what you can tow it is what you can safely stop. You can get into a wreck as soon as you back out of the driveway distance to the water does not matter. It is either safe or it is foolish.   Art
653740,lew,2012-01-05 22:59:00,12766, Exactly why I said above that the OP may have a problem with his insurance company if he overloads his tow vehicle.
653743,Entropy,2012-01-05 23:12:00,747,"You will be fine.  I tow a 17' MirroCraft Profisherman loaded with my '06 Grand Caravan.  I think it is rated for up to 3000 lbs, or as low as 1500 lbs with 4 adults and 'luggage'.  Entropy"
653757,workwear,2012-01-06 00:09:00,592, i second what dan has said....i bought my boat thinking i could tow it a very short distance....well i could....but coming out of the ramp was a real challenge...upgraded to a full size real wheel van...no issues whatso ever now...  i used to panick when it would rain....lol
653773,Dutch,2012-01-06 00:39:00,831,"Doesn't matter how far the drive is - it is not safe to do it.  Don't they say most accidents happen within 5 k.m of home?  Anyway.....  I wouldn't be putting myself, or family in harm's way.  I am 95% sure if the launch is anything but 100% clear cement you won't even have enough torque to pull it out.  Forget about it even if it is cement if there is the famous ""lip"" where the concrete ends and drops 3+ inches to the bottom of the body of water.  Is it a steep launch - more problems for you.  The weight on the hitch will have you require someone to sit on the hood to get traction - I've seen it before.  Either get a smaller boat, a dock where you can moor it or a proper tow vehicle for the boat."
653774,Entropy,2012-01-06 00:40:00,747," I launch and pull my boat out of the sand launch at View Lake, no problems, but I know what I'm working with and act accordingly.  Just use it.  Entropy"
653791,sneak_e_pete,2012-01-06 01:06:00,540,"O.K., I feel like a total tool...I actually took the time to look into the towing capacity rather than rely on what the sales guy at the dealership told me, and it is actually 3,600 lbs.  Sorry."
653799,Dutch,2012-01-06 01:17:00,831,"That sounds more reasonable for what you want to do with it.  At 1500, I would stick to my original comments."
653839,Jewelbee,2012-01-06 02:21:00,422,Oh Thank God!!!! LOL!!!!
653891,Entropy,2012-01-06 04:00:00,747," 3600 lbs with the van 'empty' right.  So put a 2500 lb package on and you still have room for more.  Also I think the shocks in my van will 'load adjust' or level out the van after 5 min of driving.  It does not have the air pkg, but does this some how.  If you are pushing the limit for weight and driving further, you might think of a trany cooler, relatively cheap and good insurance.  Entropy"
653922,Jer,2012-01-06 11:39:00,1426,"I was surprised when you said the towing capacity was only 1500lb, 3600lb seems more realistic.  The last minivan I had was a '98 Caravan, I towed my old 16' boat everywhere with that and never had a problem at a launch that was in reasonable shape."
