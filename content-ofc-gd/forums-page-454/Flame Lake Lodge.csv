A 2nd trip is planned for mid August, I came across the Flame Lake Lodge website which is located about 1 hr South of Chapleau on Hwy. 129. The rates are very reasonable and it looks like a nice place. I have never been in this area and would appreciate any fishing information about Flame Lake and the surrounding lakes. Flame Lake lodge maybe more of a resort than the fishing camp type lodge we prefer.  Thank you, Seanik"
653272,aplumma,2012-01-04 18:52:00,6896,You can do a little research on many of the area up north here Ontario Fishing Network. The reviews are honest and links to the site by area are there.   Art
653333,10point,2012-01-04 21:58:00,165, Do they have reviews from customers on that site? I can only find stuff written by the resort itself.
653348,aplumma,2012-01-04 22:34:00,6896,The lodges usually have testimonials from their customers. What I do is look at the sites and after finding the price and location then post on the board for actual people that have been their.    Art

653573,chris.brock,2012-01-05 15:31:00,4053,"never heard of the place, I was curious so I found it on a map, close to hwy 129, on the east side, it's a pretty small lake, less than 5 km long without many bays/ islands I think those smaller Chapleau area lakes can be tough fishing when they are small and receive a fair bit of pressure check out Bisco too (if you haven't already), about the same distance driving, Grey Owl Camp, Ritchies End of Trail Camp, even better is Rays Camp on Ramsey (near Bisco)"
