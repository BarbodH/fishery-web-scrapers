653689,Nipfisher,2012-01-05 20:55:00,2449,I lost the plastic cover for my auger blades last year at seasons end. Had them oiled and wrapped this off-season and forgot about it. So when I took it out I realized I need one. Went to Can. Tire and no luck. I'll check WalMart and a few tackle shops. Any ideas? Can I make one out of something? Anyone heading North this weekend that could pick one up for me?
653691,cheaptackle,2012-01-05 21:03:00,849,Big plastic mixing bowl from the dollar store or cut the bottom off a big pail and a bungee cord?  Probably be able to make 20 for the price of an o.e.m.  Michael
653692,ketchenany,2012-01-05 21:08:00,3229,A small pail would probably do it (cat litter). Replace the handle with a bungee cord so you can wrap it around the shaft.
653709,misfish,2012-01-05 21:51:00,29133,Hit your local tackle shop and ask.
653712,NAW,2012-01-05 21:58:00,4022,Princess auto?
653713,irishfield,2012-01-05 22:00:00,26272,I got lucky last year when another member remembered seeing one in a Canadian Tire store ...marked down even... went and purchased it and mailed it to me.
653714,Terry,2012-01-05 22:01:00,14456,I lost mine last year and hope to find one somewhere
653722,Nipfisher,2012-01-05 22:21:00,2449,"  Great ideas Mike and I thought of them all. Guess I don't want to put a mixing bowl / bucket on my $300 auger? I will use something for this weekend.   Nick, no Princess Auto here in North Bay.  Can Tire had some last year. Like I said I'll check Wally World and some tackle shops.  If anyone is coming up this weekend and knows of a place that carries them that would be great."
653732,mukluk,2012-01-05 22:41:00,196,"Maybe try Canadian Tire again.  Go to the sports dept.   They have books under the counter where you can get a part number and they can order you one.   May take 3-4 days.  They do sell Jiffy products.   That's how I obtained my second 10"" cover.  Now I put a bungee cord through the cover and auger just in case it wants to part company again."
653739,misfish,2012-01-05 22:58:00,29133,  Why am I not surprised.
653742,Rod Caster,2012-01-05 23:12:00,5784,"I lost mine for my 4"" auger... at Canadian Tire haha. I was bringing it in to find a new strap and I left it at an unknown location. Stupid me hahaha. Can Tire in North Bay doesn't have much in terms of replacement parts for augers. No plastic butterfly screws. No guard straps, no guards and very small blade selection."
653744,irishfield,2012-01-05 23:14:00,26272," I gave up looking for the knobbed straps everywhere and finally bought a pair off Ebay. This is the only place I can find the old 10"" strapped cover so far.. direct from Jiffy. They've switched to the ""quicksnap"" on all their new stuff and it's available from the fishinghole in Manitoba.  http://www.jiffyonice.com/EComStore/product/standard-blade-protectors,2733,21.htm"
653745,Ice Fishing Ham,2012-01-05 23:15:00,83,I lost the cover for my 8 inch Jiffy last year and wasn't going to pay $25 for a new one. So I made this one. Its made with 3 layers of Â¾ ply wood and a bungee cord. The photos don't show it but the blade is suspended and does not rest on the bottom all the weight of the auger is supported on the bottom plate.         
653747,irishfield,2012-01-05 23:17:00,26272,NICE!
653805,Nipfisher,2012-01-06 01:30:00,2449,Good job IFH. I'm not that handy so it'll be a bucket of some sorts until I replace it.
653807,mike rousseau,2012-01-06 01:34:00,4661,What about a PVC/ABS pipe cap...  Not sure how much they cost but I'm sure you could find one somewhere...  Then drill a couple holes for a bungee and water drain...    ...
653808,Harrison,2012-01-06 01:37:00,2202,"I took a look for ya sir, no luck finding a cover.  Found some replacement blades and extensions for a deal though."
653820,Nipfisher,2012-01-06 02:05:00,2449,Thanks for the help guys.
653825,Nipfisher,2012-01-06 02:09:00,2449,What......? It kept my son's head safe. Pictures were taken with my phone.  Not sure who's gonna be more proud Wayne or Billy Bob?        
653829,Rod Caster,2012-01-06 02:10:00,5784,  ...where do the knee pads go??
653832,irishfield,2012-01-06 02:13:00,26272,That's using your head!
653846,Leecher,2012-01-06 02:34:00,7832,Simplicity... That'll work
654129,ld17,2012-01-06 22:41:00,319,what is this world coming to? Got to admit I will work but butt ugly!
