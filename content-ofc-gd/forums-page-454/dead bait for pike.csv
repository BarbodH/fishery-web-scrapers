654066,mike rousseau,2012-01-06 20:17:00,4661,im gunna try dead bait on my tip up for pike this weekend and i was wondering if anybody had tips/advice for me...  im probably gunna be fishing 20-30 feet of water... clear water... so how deep do i set the dead bait at?  what kinda rig works best?  the baits are big suckers left over from fall musky fishing... i froze them in water with salt added... they are 8-12 inches in length...  thanks for any info you can spare...  after icing 2 pike my last time out im starting to get confidence in tip ups...
654069,Gerritt,2012-01-06 20:21:00,6129,"For dead suckers, I would honestly suggest a Windlass to help give the bait a bit of movement making it appear more alive... Rigged quick strike  my 0.2 cents worth.  G."
654073,Raf,2012-01-06 20:25:00,3495,"windlass, quick strike, set it up inches off the bottom, drive a railroad spike through the dead bait (frozen bait will tend to wanna float)."
654074,mike rousseau,2012-01-06 20:26:00,4661,  thats what i was thinking...  i have a windlass tip-up rigged with a 2 treble quick strike  one treble behind the head and the other behind the dorsal
654080,DRIFTER_016,2012-01-06 20:39:00,10439,"I either use a quick strike rig on a tipup or on a dead stick rod in a holder. Every 1/2 hour or so I will go and do a gentle lift and fall with the bait. This gets any lookers to commit. I don't use the windlas tipups because they just don't work up here in the middle of the winter. The holes are iced over 1/4"" thick at the 1/2 hour intervals I check so they freeze into the ice in minutes. I use the old school wooden traps but even these don't work great up here in the dead of winter. After landing a fish I have to pull off about 30' of line off the spool to free it up. The line is a block of ice by the time I have caught/released and rebaited. I find the dead stick in a holder works better at this time of year (less work anyway)  This is my preferred set up.  "
654085,Raf,2012-01-06 20:45:00,3495," i am just playing devil's advocate (because that's the rig i use too)  but, some will say a CO *MAY* hassle you for 2 trebles... in a bait situation, each point counts as a hook and thus you are over the limit on hooks."
654086,DRIFTER_016,2012-01-06 20:46:00,10439, Not if you put a spinner blade on just above each hook as it's then considered a lure.
654087,Raf,2012-01-06 20:47:00,3495," yes, that's my way around it too.  but...................."
654088,Big Cliff,2012-01-06 20:49:00,6899,"many years ago the only thing we used for ice fishing pike was dead smelts, we'd just set up a drop shot rig and hang the smelt about 1' off bottom. We didn't use ice rods, we'd just cut a tree branch, stick it in the snow/ice, and hang our line off the branch. We use to catch plenty of pike that way."
654090,Terry,2012-01-06 20:53:00,14456, they removed that from the regs. to make quick strike rigs legal in ontario......each treble counts as one on live baits and lures
654091,Raf,2012-01-06 20:56:00,3495,"was not aware of that terry.. when did that happen?  if that's the case, carry on.."
654093,mike rousseau,2012-01-06 20:59:00,4661,  Really?
654099,Raf,2012-01-06 21:10:00,3495,"i keed you not.  like i said, frozen dead bait will want to float.  by putting someething heavy in its cavity you'll keep it down as well as oriented properly (ie. not floating sideways)"
654100,irishfield,2012-01-06 21:11:00,26272,That's the reason for all the derailments around Parry Sound !
654102,lhousesoccer,2012-01-06 21:16:00,442,"Bob Izumi had a show up north somewhere with Gord Pyzer, where they were hanging giant dead, frozen whitefish on tip-ups under the ice for big pike.  You can watch it here:  http://www.realfishing.com/rf/player.php?f=200904"
654108,Terry,2012-01-06 21:22:00,14456,"well they changed the wording slightly, I can't get a clear reading on it, but I was told it was to allow quick strike rigs and others to use 2 trebles......but who know for sure 100%, I was also told the MNR was contacted and confirmed..I don't totally trust what they say but"
