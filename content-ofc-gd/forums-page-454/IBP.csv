653888,lovetofish,2012-01-06 03:54:00,500,Awesome!!!
653441,Fisherman,2012-01-05 02:56:00,7201," Ha ha ha, good one, along with using a hand held electronic device while driving... just makes you wonder."
653442,irishfield,2012-01-05 02:57:00,26272,Amazing he can cause such a ruckus around here.. and he hasn't even posted in 4 years!
653446,lovetofish,2012-01-05 03:06:00,500,"  Sorry, maybe i just didn't have anything to post or the time to do it.  I thought people would want to know.  I was only sharing some information that i came across, I thought that's what we do on the board... share information???  If I saved 1 person a drive up there, isn't it worth it?"
653447,irishfield,2012-01-05 03:07:00,26272,Wasn't talking about you posting lovetofish... was talking about Peter and you getting sucked into his rederick.
653449,lovetofish,2012-01-05 03:15:00,500,  Oh.  It was kind of a rant too.  We were planning on first putting our hut on Cook's Bay via Gilford Rd and then move it latter to IBP when the ice got thick enough.  First they put the gates up at Gilford Rd and then they blocked the access at IBP.  And of course Peter got me going too
653471,Freshtrax,2012-01-05 05:26:00,2215,Just so you guys know if you know anyone who lives in innisfill they can get at many stickers as they want justask them to go to city hall with proof or residence and they give you a sticker.  I hate it when i have to pay to access a lake that is as rightfully mine as someone who lives in city limits.
653492,Billy Bob,2012-01-05 11:51:00,5865," If the mindset here is like most everywhere else, then the $25 fee is to discourage non-residents from using the park. So they actually want less business not more. Your only good to them when they need your money for larger issues that involve federal money so that community doesn't have to pay for it themselves."
653496,OutdoorDan,2012-01-05 11:57:00,325," That doesn't make sense to me.  Bringing in non-residents into the area would have so many benefits.  Non-residents that come in stop for gas, get minnows from the local bait shop, rent huts from local operators and stop by the local coffee place to grab a bite.  There is no way small businesses in the area shouldn't be pushing for more ""outsiders"" to come to the area.  Unless I'm missing something?"
653519,Fish Farmer,2012-01-05 13:10:00,2234,Thanks for posting Lovetofish. It does help some that travel there. Peter has saved allot of wasted trips there especially with the high gas prices and disappointed kids that have to go back home because the ice is not safe. It's great that he keeps us aware of safe ice and when we can make the trip. I check his site every day. Should be more people like him.
653523,Billy Bob,2012-01-05 13:30:00,5865," Yes you are....  Only IF you are a business owner who benefits from increased traffic from outsiders do you welcome outsiders to use said park....if you're a resident all those using ""your park"" is nothing more then a nuisance to you and the town that has to clean up the park.  MANY town parks here that took no Federal or State money to build said park restricts those parks to residents ONLY...nothing a outsider here can do about it but complain to the wind.  Once you get a group of town folks getting together and attending town board meetings, anything can happen....the squeaky wheel get the grease."
653530,crappieperchhunter,2012-01-05 13:51:00,2582," What us fishermen leave in Innisfil is peanuts and it benefits very few. Myself I get a coffee at Timmies for the ride back home and that's it.  I know some spend more but some don't even make a coffee stop.  But when the mayor has to listen to the voters ....who each pay more in property taxes in one year then most of us will spend there in a lifetime...complain about the traffic, crowds and garbage left behind by us out of towners...who do you really think the mayor or counsel will listen too?  We are unwanted guests plain and simple. I'm not happy about it either...but that's the reality as far as I am concerned."
653532,Rustic-Fisher,2012-01-05 13:54:00,826, Not unlimited and each time you get one they keep a record of it with your taxes.  I really had to come up with some good excuses last year for an extra pass.
653574,Freshtrax,2012-01-05 15:33:00,2215,"Ahh my mistake  then i do not live there .. I know my mamily members that live there do have quite a few passes "" floating around"""
653576,Terry,2012-01-05 15:35:00,14456,well if anyone has any extra passes they don't want I could use it LOL
653578,Billy Bob,2012-01-05 15:39:00,5865," Talk to the Skipper, he's sending me 8 family club cards that will save me double the amount over the 4 he originally offered.....maybe he has some of those   Innisfill town park passes he can send you...."
653602,BillM,2012-01-05 16:22:00,17367,I could use one of those infamous passes as well!!!!
653627,Fisherman,2012-01-05 17:33:00,7201,"Don't think the resident pass is foolproof, I've heard of the gate attendant asking for ID with address."
653628,lovetofish,2012-01-05 17:34:00,500,Do i get one for starting  this thread? Lol
653631,BillM,2012-01-05 17:38:00,17367, It is when you're parking anywhere else that requires a pass (Bear point for example)
653635,OutdoorDan,2012-01-05 17:45:00,325,"Thanks Billy Bob and crappieperchhunter, that makes more sense now."
653644,misfish,2012-01-05 18:03:00,29133,"Im getting one,yeehaw."
653698,Jds63,2012-01-05 21:19:00,1365,according to Blue ice report today the IBP barriers were removed .....
653718,Billy Bob,2012-01-05 22:13:00,5865, There you go....lovetofish did some good....they must of seen he's video...
653720,misfish,2012-01-05 22:19:00,29133,"  I think not BB  This  one would be the MAIN reason,,,,,,,,,,,,Surprised you missed it.  JOP said it right.  I think you will likely see the barriers removed( or at least a few of them), Local fire/rescue personal will need a place for launching their ice rescue boats in the event of an emergency and thats the spot.  Myself I could careless if I couldnt get my machine on from this spot. Like I said,theres other places to access."
653738,OrangePeal,2012-01-05 22:58:00,37,"I seen on another site that the barriers are removed. Looks like the town listened to people.....who'd of though?  Safe Fishing First, Jack"
653250,lovetofish,2012-01-04 17:47:00,500,"I'm sure there a more then a few people that fish out of IBP, can't believe what they did!!!!  <iframe src=""http://www.ustream.tv/embed/recorded/19565836"" width=""608"" height=""368"" scrolling=""no"" frameborder=""0"" style=""border: 0px none transparent;""></iframe>   lovetofish"
653251,lovetofish,2012-01-04 17:50:00,500,"Oh yeah, here are the numbers to the town of Innisfil 705 436 3710 and 1 888 436 3710"
653253,Terry,2012-01-04 17:56:00,14456,I would go the that website if you paid me
653255,tb4me,2012-01-04 18:00:00,3295,did I miss somthing..All i get is a link to another fishing board..Is this good or bad?
653256,lovetofish,2012-01-04 18:09:00,500,Sorry. play the video in the middle of the screen.  It shows how they blocked access to the lake
653257,e-z-out,2012-01-04 18:11:00,1052,that's to sucks to see that the city has blocked off the boat launch at the park. guess I'll have to look for another way to get into the ice this year.  thanks for the heads up.  By the way how will this effect the fishing for Tylor this year?
653259,crappieperchhunter,2012-01-04 18:18:00,2582,I'm sure it's the same as when they did a new dock at Sibbald. They do the work when it effects...the lest visitors or resident people. That would be fall or winter...plain and simple. I'm not happy about it either. But I understand how these things work.  Relax people there are lots of other places to fish on Simcoe. It's a big lake.
653265,misfish,2012-01-04 18:41:00,29133,So they blocked the launch? You can still access the park? There are other means to get on with a machine in that area.
653267,Dara,2012-01-04 18:44:00,3052,Its to keep the dumb   off so they don't sink their suv's
653273,tb4me,2012-01-04 18:55:00,3295,Ok I seen the video.. Looks to be lots of room for a sled or a quad to get thru.
653276,Joey,2012-01-04 19:06:00,9122,"Ya, looks like plenty of room for sleds to get through, should be fine."
653281,Roy,2012-01-04 19:19:00,13728,"They are probably protecting people against themselves by blocking their way on or off the water at this time of year with a boat or a hut. Once everything is safe, it's a 10 minute job to move those barriers out of the way. But if you really must know why it was done, call Ol' Barb eh? It's Innisfil, folks. I'm sure the mairess answers her own phone.  Methinks there might have been an ulterior motive for the thread."
653284,lovetofish,2012-01-04 19:31:00,500,Was hoping to put our hut out there... . No other motive. They did something similar at the end of gilford road
653285,lovetofish,2012-01-04 19:31:00,500,Was hoping to put our hut out there... . No other motive. They did something similar at the end of gilford road
653286,Roy,2012-01-04 19:35:00,13728,You got two huts?
653288,Roy,2012-01-04 19:38:00,13728,"Seriously though, call the town, call Barb Baguley, she's approachable I'm sure. They'll tell you what's up then you can decide what to do about it if anything."
653289,irishfield,2012-01-04 19:40:00,26272,Great to see Peter driving an unfit vehicle!!
653291,Rustic-Fisher,2012-01-04 19:50:00,826,"I think you will likely see the  barriers removed( or at least a few of them), Local fire/rescue personal will need a place for launching their ice rescue boats in the event of an emergency and thats the spot. I would not panic just yet. Although as mentioned  its a great way to protect people from themselves. R"
653292,lovetofish,2012-01-04 19:52:00,500,I hope they move a couple... Our hut is just over 7ft wide
653300,BillM,2012-01-04 20:02:00,17367," Pretty much, there is ALWAYS a giant gaping hole at the end of that boat ramp because some idiot decided to drive out instead of testing the ice first.  This goes for snowmachines, trucks, whatever."
653329,lovetofish,2012-01-04 21:53:00,500,Sry my phone is doing strange things
653366,skeeter,2012-01-04 23:08:00,1907,Lets hope they remove them soon. There are a lot of people that use that ramp to take their hut out. 
653371,edmichit,2012-01-04 23:13:00,145,"These are actually construction barriers, they are working to improve the launch for summer boaters, and improve the access to the lake. If you have ever tried to launch there you can understand how difficult it is in the fall when the water level is dropped. The docks you see are actually new.  PS - During safe ice times, you can drive off the end of the 9th line and park on the ice.....or keep on driving."
653375,lovetofish,2012-01-04 23:22:00,500, Thanks for the tip
653399,OutdoorDan,2012-01-05 00:51:00,325,"Is the 25$ non-resident a new thing or is that just for the summer boat launch?  If I recall correctly,  it used to be 15$ to park in the winter before.  They should really make it less (5-10$ or a 60$ 3 month winter pass).  They would actually get more business like this, as a lot of people (myself included) go elsewhere.  15$ isn't much when you factor in gas and equipment to get out ice fishing, but it's the principle of it."
