They also said i'd be getting my seniors card to use when I get prescriptions, well to date it hasn't arrived so I called service canada today and they informed me they have run out of cards. They said they have more clients than cards and were doing their best to get some.  Only in Canada, where they have known since 1945, 1946 they were going to have a major influx of seniors in this decade would they allow themselves to be short of inventory.  they told me to try and use my drivers licence as id when i get my prescriptions to prove i'm eligible for medicare."

653542,Roy,2012-01-05 14:12:00,13728," I guess they didn't cut the health care budget enough, eh?"

653563,Big Cliff,2012-01-05 14:57:00,6899,"Got mine last year, it split the second day I had it. Never did have to use it for anything. It isn't even considered a valid form of ID with any government agency as there is no photo on it. More of our tax payers money spent on something that is no use to us. I didn't have any trouble at the drug store, just used my drivers license."
