""Today, we were notified that TRUCO ENTERPRISES LP in conjunction with the Food and Drug Administration has initiated a Recall on its ON THE BORDER 64OZ (Pina Colada Only) due to undeclared allergen (tree nut - coconut)"".  I realize that it's the law to declare all ingredients on a product.....but come on....Who would of thought that there would be ""coconut"" in a PINA COLADA...DUH...BTW I never purchased this item, so that tells me Sam's Club is sending this letter to every memember...  Also in yesterday's mail is a small settlement check from a Currency Conversion Fee Antitrust Litigation....it's a postcard type mailing that you have to open up....on the inside it has what they call a Record Update Verification that you should fill out if they have the incorrect address for you....DUH again.  It never ceases to amaze me how governments and sometimes business waste precious dollars on stupid stuff, but then claim they have no money for way more important stuff...."
653972,cranks bait,2012-01-06 14:46:00,721,What get's me rolling is when they send me a letter to tell me they are going to send me a letter next week....Thanks for letting me know.
653976,SirCranksalot,2012-01-06 15:18:00,3291,"Not mail as such, but when your Bell Canada internet konks out and you phone them, 1 of the recorded messages you get says that help is available on-line!!! (As an alternative to hanging on the phone for a 1/2 an hour I guess!)"
653979,Photoz,2012-01-06 15:25:00,792,"I deposited a small (rebate) cheque ($18.00 American) from St. Croix about 2 weeks ago. Yesterday I got a notice in the mail ($.57 stamp) that my cheque was worth $18.04,the extra has now been credited to my account! Just amazing . . . .    I'm surprised they didn't charge ME postage!  When I'm sorting mail at work I often get letters to 'ADDRESSEE UNKNOWN' &  or 'ADDRESSEE DECEASED' with a postal code and street number!"

653988,Skipper D,2012-01-06 15:44:00,1970,Its to bad that the world is full of people who want to be leaders first and for most when they don't know how to be fallowers .
653989,Billy Bob,2012-01-06 15:50:00,5865,"  OMG........Roy, I just pissed my pants...."
