653339,DanD,2012-01-04 22:09:00,2223,"Heres a wiring diagram that may help you sort this out; not the clearest but you should be able to read it. The fan speed switch & the resistor on this vehicle are grounding circuits. An easy test is to connect a test light to battery positive and probe the wire connector at the resistor; with the resistor disconnected. Using the wiring diagram put the switch speed to the corresponding connector terminal of the resistor and the test light should light. For example. Switch set to low speed; test light probe to terminal 1, the tan wire of the resistor connector; the light should light. Do this for all speeds. If the test light lights for all speeds then you know the speed selector switch is ok. If you want to try a quick test for the motor itself; take a jumper wire from ground and then to terminal 4 the black/tan wire at the resistor. Turn the ignition to the run position and if all is good the motor should run at high speed. So if the switch checks out and the motor will run with the jumper wire; the resistor has packed in again. I had one customers vehicle take two resistors out with in 6 months; found that the blower motor (even though it seemed to run fine) was at fault due to it drawing to much amperage and burning out the resistors clamping diode. Let me know if Ive lost you with the testing and Ill try to explain again or go further as in testing the power side of the circuit and the blower motor relay.  Dan.  Oh man you guys are fast I sent this without checking the thread and here I am repeating everything you guys have already said. Sorry. "
653342,Skipper D,2012-01-04 22:17:00,1970,"Thanks Dan , i'll print it off along with Bernies when i get it in the shop and we should be able to get to the bottom off it ...... hec i can't go wrong with all the help thats offered on this board , hope i can return the favor to some one later ... lol ."
653640,Skipper D,2012-01-05 17:55:00,1970,"Some one had ask for me to let them know what the problem was with my jeep once i had it fixed . I got it in the shop this morning and found there was a bad connection in the plug at the heater sensor relay  , the locking tab was not locked on the plug letting it sag down and loose its contact  , once put back in to place every thing is working now the way it should . Thanks every one for your help ........... Ron ."
653643,Skipper D,2012-01-05 18:02:00,1970,Yes some what ..lol. more so at the fact it did'nt cost any thing to fix it ....lol .
652963,Skipper D,2012-01-03 21:13:00,1970,"2001 Jeep TJ , There are four settings for the heater blower motor , only the number two setting is working which is not enough to clean the windshield off on thease cold days , i did change the heat sensor relay this fall and all the settings did work but the other day it went back to only having two lower settings working , what do you think its going to take to fix it this time ?"
652968,Nipfisher,2012-01-03 21:17:00,2449,  I had a similar problem in my Ford and it was a vacuum hose.

652971,davey buoy,2012-01-03 21:20:00,5505,Skip I don't know about yours but my explorer has a resister block for lack of a better word and it was common to have that burn out or the connector. Mine it allowed you to still use the highest setting as that bypassed the resistors and was wired directly to the battery. It was located right at the fan motor connection. Hope this may give you a idea. Dave.
652973,Skipper D,2012-01-03 21:25:00,1970,"the lack of the better words part on this thing is what i changed in the fall , i am thinking that it may be the heater switch it self is the problem but i'd like to be sure before i waste the money and more so the time to change it and find out thats not it .................. lol"
652974,davey buoy,2012-01-03 21:29:00,5505,"The actual connector causes half the problem,not only the resistors,they recommend changing both."
652975,COUNTRYBOY,2012-01-03 21:33:00,130,CHECK THE CONNECTIONS AT THE RESISTOR PLUG FIRST. I WOULD MOST LIKELY THINK SWITCH. IF THE RESISTOR GOES...YOU USUALLY ONLY GET HI FAN UNLESS ONE OF THE PINS HAS CORROSION ON IT.
652978,Skipper D,2012-01-03 21:36:00,1970,"recommend changing both ? , to bad i did'nt ice fish , i could use a fish hut heater to get the jod done but that would'nt help the resale value any .......... lol ...... the darn thing . We need a jeep guy Davey to help us out with this maybe , i know i don't have any of them in my tool box right now , sure wished i did ... lol"
652979,davey buoy,2012-01-03 21:36:00,5505," Your right,it could be the selector switch itself,check that if you can skip."

Was very simple fix and if I recall correctly, the new resistor was only about $25 bucks at NAPA.  Good luck and let us know what it was.  Cheers  Craig"

653142,Bernie,2012-01-04 04:44:00,3190,"Hi. In this case, I'd say chances are it is the switch. In high speed, the power bypasses the resistor. In the diagram ,notice position 5 goes direct to the blower. Also, with the issues you are having, it may be a good idea to make sure the blower motor is not drawing to much energy. It could be overloading the circuit and taking out these components.  "
