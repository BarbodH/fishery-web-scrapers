653472,Freshtrax,2012-01-05 05:39:00,2215,Well i headed up to opikma hunt and fishing camp on the 26th. Had a great time thanks for all the advice guys.  First of.. I left the camera in barrie im really bummed.  But other than that we all had a great trip the camp is rustic. Nothing fancy.  The owers and there dog patch were awsome!  Mike did his best to poin us in the direction of fish.  The first day we fished for splake and bows caught a few splake nothing huge mike said they were yearlings.    The next day i headed into the woods on the sled to a lake with lakers open all year and got my asskicked.. I did have the pleasure of meeting a moose on the logging road.  The folowing day caught some specks all small again.( I guess im not smart enough to catch the five pounders i could see at times swing around ). Then we laid the smackdown on pike and perch for a day.  On the last day we tried for the lakers again and got skunked a seccond time.  All in all a great trip if anyone wants details pm me.
