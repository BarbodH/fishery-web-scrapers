653521,Billy Bob,2012-01-05 13:11:00,5865,"I'm not sure if this price is available in Canada, but if it is and you're thinking about a on-board charger....then you cannot beat this deal.  http://www.cabelas.com/catalog/search_catalog_command.cmd?fromProductSearch=true&item1=IK-021785"
653522,Skipper D,2012-01-05 13:28:00,1970,"Hey ! Billy Bob bing bong ball , still shopping are ya ........"
653524,Billy Bob,2012-01-05 13:35:00,5865," No, not really....Since I'm a Cabela's Signature Card holder I get sale notices that are not advertised to the average smucks like you guys....LOL...so I thought I would pass on this great saving opportunity....BTW I have this exact charger on my boat and love it."
653527,Skipper D,2012-01-05 13:49:00,1970,Well can i interest you in a OFC member ship card to great deals for all your fishing gear ? ...... lol
653531,Billy Bob,2012-01-05 13:53:00,5865,Sure...but you have to offer free shipping....
653541,Skipper D,2012-01-05 14:10:00,1970,"Not a problem , Heres how it works , Cliff pay attenion , Ok BB you get the member ship card for your self at the cost of 82.50 us funds and thats good for one year before you have to renew it again , now if you would like to lower that cost of this member ship you can add on extra cards for the rest of your family say like one for the wife and son and daughter giving you a greater savings , so lets say you take four cards in total , your total cost for your family would only be 337.50 which you can pay this amount quarterly . So would you like me to send you the four cards ?"
653548,Billy Bob,2012-01-05 14:27:00,5865," Skipper, could you send me 8 family cards so I can double my savings...I'm always looking out for a bargain since I'm on a fixed income...."
653550,Skipper D,2012-01-05 14:33:00,1970,"Thats not a problem MR BB , just let me total that up for you ...................  Maybe Harold we should hit the road and do a comedy routine ......"
653554,BillM,2012-01-05 14:45:00,17367,The reviews on that charger aren't the greatest.
653565,Billy Bob,2012-01-05 15:05:00,5865," Yes, I seen that but don't understand it...and it's only 3 reviews.  Here on the main site of this charger where I once purchased it, it enjoys a much higher rating of 4.1 out of 5 stars.....go figure. Either way at $79.99 it's almost too good to be true.  http://www.cabelas.com/product/Boating/AutoBoat-Batteries-Chargers/On-Board-Chargers-Inverters%7C/pc/104794380/c/104698080/sc/104465880/Cabelas-Advanced-Anglers-ProSport-II-On-Board-Marine-Battery-Chargers/734150.uts?destination=%2Fcatalog%2Fbrowse%2Fboating-auto-boat-batteries-chargers-on-board-chargers-inverters%2F_%2FN-1100565%2FNs-CATEGORY_SEQ_104465880%3FWTz_l%3DSBC%253BMMcat104794380%253Bcat104698080&WTz_l=SBC%3BMMcat104794380%3Bcat104698080%3Bcat104465880#productChart  Bottom line it has Cabela's name on it and they stand proudly behind each and every one of their products."
653568,BillM,2012-01-05 15:14:00,17367,I need a 2 bank for the new boat.... decisions decisions!!!
653581,Roy,2012-01-05 15:41:00,13728,I bought the Guest 2 bank at Cabela's and have used it 3 full seasons. At the time it was on sale for $119. It works flawlessly.
653584,BillM,2012-01-05 15:45:00,17367,Thanks for the input Roy!
653626,lew,2012-01-05 17:30:00,12766," Guest is an excellent charger Roy, I put one in my last boat in '99 and it's still going strong."
653647,Roy,2012-01-05 18:31:00,13728," Come to think of it Lew, I think you were the one who put me on to that brand of charger. If it was, thanks and if it wasn't, thanks all the same."
653649,lew,2012-01-05 18:35:00,12766,"If it was me Roy, then your welcome  I think mine was model 2611, a really excellent charger."
653664,Roy,2012-01-05 19:32:00,13728, Bingo! I have the culprit now. Mine is the 2611 as well.
653674,lew,2012-01-05 19:57:00,12766, Then you can be sure you won't need to buy another charger for your boat for a very long time Roy.
653782,Dutch,2012-01-06 00:54:00,831,Good deal on a 3 bank here:  http://www.smallparts.com/noco-gen3-genius-battery-charger/dp/B003JSO1X2/ref=sr_1_3?sr=1-3&qid=1317011366  Free shipping to a US address.
653904,Uncle Buck,2012-01-06 04:48:00,1000,Pro MAriner Chargers are junk...  I've read many reviews stating premature failures on them...  I sold the one i bought on clearance before ever using it...  too many bad reviews... they are JUNK  Guest Chargers have the best reviews...
