654154,Nipfisher,2012-01-06 23:30:00,2449,"Got out with some buddies on Callander Bay this afternoon. Fished from 2pm - 5pm. I got there around 3:15. We ended up catching 4 walleye in total with 3 keepers and one slot size walleye that was 58 cm (23""). The guys caught 2 pike before I showed up and they said one of the pike was covered in black spots. We also caught 9 keeper perch over 8"" and threw back many more. 10.5"" of solid ice.    Here is the slot sized walleye that was released to spawn again if it can?              Anyone know what this disease is?"
654155,Joeytier,2012-01-06 23:35:00,3990,I believe it's called the 'Lemmy' disease.  Is your hut out yet?
654156,mercman,2012-01-06 23:36:00,7054,Nice going Blair !!! Thats one poor devil of a fish though  No radioactive waste nearby??
654158,Roy,2012-01-06 23:47:00,13728,It's lymphocystis/walleye dermal sarcoma. It won't kill the fish (probably doesn't help its chances of finding a mate though) and is not harmful to humans. Ugly as hell though and I would probably wear two pairs of waterproof gloves to release the fish.
654161,johnl,2012-01-06 23:52:00,197,ya those are some ugly marks still a nice walleye though
654163,NAW,2012-01-06 23:58:00,4022,Can't wait till the 29th.  Thanks for the teaser!
654165,Nipfisher,2012-01-07 00:01:00,2449,  Thanks Roy. I usually kis them before releasing them but NOT THIS ONE.
654166,Nipfisher,2012-01-07 00:02:00,2449,  28th Nick.
654168,NAW,2012-01-07 00:04:00,4022,"Wups.. Ya, that's what I thought I typed. Darn fat fingers.."
654178,Rod Caster,2012-01-07 00:18:00,5784,That's a good outing Blair. Sounds like your in the right spot.  Quite the horrible lesions on that fish.. maybe that's one you kissed last year

654188,Leecher,2012-01-07 00:35:00,7832,"Blair, I've seen this type of bobo on walleyes before   but not as intensive as this one    Looks like you guys had a great time congrats"
654194,SirWhite,2012-01-07 00:44:00,210,"Question Should that fish have been stopped from going back in the water? How does this disease work?  Its sad really, on such a Nice fish."
654201,Nipfisher,2012-01-07 00:54:00,2449,  Slot sized fish must be immediately released. Even if it was dead I am supposed to put it back in. Some real nice fillets on it though.
654228,mike rousseau,2012-01-07 01:55:00,4661,These sores seen to really show up in cold weather...  I don't see many all year... But come nov dec... We start seeing them...  Same with black dots on largemouth bass... Only ever see this in the winter...
654240,EC1,2012-01-07 02:40:00,930,"I've only had 1 walleye with it before, and it wasn't anywhere close to being that serious. Not knowing it had that until I got home, I ended up eating it anyways after cutting a little bit of that section off. I don't recall of the walleye tasting different or anything.  Glad to see you into fish though! Congrats!"
654242,Rizzo,2012-01-07 02:53:00,4754,"man that is nasty. I have a friend who is in a bungalow on callender bay for the next couple of days. They had comparable fishing today - couple of walleye, bunch of perch, a herring and even a couple of smallies!"
654246,limeyangler,2012-01-07 03:06:00,5204,"  Good fishin' Blair.......Wayne is just jealous   those black spots have quite a story behind them too.   Black Spot is actually the larvae of a parasite. The parasite has a quite complex lifecycle- and would be very lucky indeed to actually complete it! It starts out (if a life cycle can startâ€¦) with snails. Eggs of the parasite in the water of creeks or rivers hatch and infect snails. Inside the liver of the snail they slowly develop, until eventually leaving the snail to find a fish. When they find a fish the larvae burrow under a scale in the fishes skin (causing much irritation to the fish). The parasites then hope the fish will be eaten by a bird or other animal so that the lifecycle can continue. When they are eaten they quickly mature in the intestines of the host animal and produce large numbers of eggs. These eggs are then excreted, making their way back to the water of a creek or river. And the cycle continues"
654249,Live2fish85,2012-01-07 03:24:00,1633,Nice work. Sounds like an awesome day on the hardwater.
654253,irishfield,2012-01-07 03:48:00,26272,"  Yah.. maybe.. but I was out scouting for spots today from the air!!! And I heard they've had pickups out past my dock on Temagami, so it might be time to GO FISH!"
654269,FieroLuke,2012-01-07 05:27:00,24,"Ugh, glad this thread wasnt my dinner time read. Between the elephant walleye and the parasites I lost any appetite I had.  Too bad, that is a nice sized fish."
