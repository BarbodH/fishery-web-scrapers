653263,Dozer,2012-01-04 18:34:00,896,"The guy who organized the so called derby probably sold it to his buddies as ""a lake filled with walleye and non of those stupid Ontarions fish it!  This lake is prrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrimeee guys!"".  An expensive lesson."
653264,Dara,2012-01-04 18:40:00,3052,Well....at least the MNR has $5k to spend on rehabing this sensitive lake....or will they just spend it on solar panels and windmills
653297,Live2fish85,2012-01-04 20:00:00,1633,Dara you are right. That money will most likely go to the windmills. Seeing as we are all going to pay for that moron Dolton Maginty.
