653503,cranks bait,2012-01-05 12:11:00,721,I just saw this on the Weather Network and am ust trying to help spread the word.  http://www.ctv.ca/CTVNews/Canada/20120105/amber-alert-kara-aiden-johnson-120105/
653505,Twocoda,2012-01-05 12:27:00,4130,its a sad day when a father cant take his kids for a drive...
653536,cranks bait,2012-01-05 14:01:00,721,And an even sadder day when you never see a loved one again.  I had two cousins abducted about 30 years ago.  To this day nobody knows if they are even alive.  I will always take an Amber Alert seriously!
653555,Twocoda,2012-01-05 14:46:00,4130,"absolutley i agree....sorry to hear of your family members...i take amber alerts seriously too....i clicked on the link and the newscaster didnt say anything about mental illness of the father or any else other than the fact that the kids are with their father...we dont know if he is protecting the kids from the the mother or what? hopefully this isnt the case for the kids sake and hopefully the father is a good loving father...we can only hope for the best. and report if we see them...Amber Alerts serve a great purpose but i just feel sometimes they post the alerts prematurely without the ""whole"" story...men have zero rights as a parent when it comes to the break up of a relationship...sadly....that is why i made my first post..  hope there is a happy ending to this story"
653558,Twocoda,2012-01-05 14:49:00,4130, adit to add: good on ya for posting ...awareness is everything!
653583,Moosebunk,2012-01-05 15:44:00,3970,It's the first time I have ever seen such an alert posted on the Weather Network.  Thought it an absolutely great idea.  Didn't realize they did this.
653609,tb4me,2012-01-05 16:36:00,3295,Alert has been cancelled..The kids were found in north bay.. Father arrested..
653619,cranks bait,2012-01-05 17:10:00,721,"Just saw that as well.  Glad the kids are safe.  Twocoda.  I understand where you are coming from, but it is not always in favour of the mother.  As for my cousins, thank you, it was the man who was married to my Aunt at the time who just ""went for a drive"" with them.  Regardless  Cheers for keeping this on top to help find two innocent children."
