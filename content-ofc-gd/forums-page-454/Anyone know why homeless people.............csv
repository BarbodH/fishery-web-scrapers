Dozer, you based your opinion from comments made by police. True, they are the front line, but they are also biased. Far too many officers view the average citizen to be, and I quote, "" lawbreakers waitng for an excuse to offend"". Yes I've Known a lot of cops in my day  Some of them put Sly Stallone to shame. Just like the Rambo types that are drawn towards today's military. It is the perspective of the self righteous and self justified who can't be bothered to look deeper into the facts. Many of our police officers are forthright and good people, but they are slowly becoming a minority. I've come to know several senior members of our police forces, and they don't care for the attitude of many a young constable. Then again, one police acquaintance was an instructor at CO Bick who was an outright bigot."

653231,Live2fish85,2012-01-04 15:57:00,1633,Alot of it has to do with how our stupid government works. They will gladly give welfare or some sort of assistance  to people that don't need it and could work or come here to better them selves with our taxes. Then when people who have worked hard need some help they screw ya. It happened to me. I just had heart surgery and they won't give me any help as I had a violation they say that when I was working a seasonal job years ago in 2007. They say I didn't make a meeting so there for I can't get help. Luckly I have fanily and friends that can help me and are willing but some people don't. I don't mean to be rude but our government needs to srop bending over to accomidate all the people immigrating here and help our own people first. Also they need to check the loser on welfare that don't need it.  I don't mean to sound rude or racial. I say this because I have seen it first hand. A friend of mine was from cuba and all her family that came here were on welfare somw being for ten years and could work easily. Also I know a few guys on welfare who work out at home all the time and sell weed but won't work as they get free government money. Makes me sick and that is why we have people on the streets some choose to be and others have no option. I try to always help when I see a homeless person asking for some help. I may not give them money but will buy them a bite to eat.

I think we need to allow WSB to respond in this thread before we bash him anymore. I believe his question/comment may have been been poorly conveyed. I don't believe he is making fun of homeless people. Rather asking why they are standing outside in the cold? Seems like a reasonable question to ask. Been about 5-6 different answers given and they all may be wrong?
653131,[email protected],2012-01-04 04:03:00,119,"  One of the best posts I've read on this site, Period.  We all/most get so wrapped up in our own lives, and forget that others may not have EVER had the opportunities we have been fortunate to have.  Imagine if you never had the opportunity to get a higher education, or one at all.  What if your parents were drug addled, or had mental issues themselves, and you were never given a shot right from the start?  Sometimes cicumstances are beyond our control.  Please don't respond with ""get a job"", as that is a very narrow minded way of thinking, and very much oversimplifying an issue of which you probably have no experience, be thankful for that.  Happy New Year to all, and lets try to be better humans this year, we all benefit."
653134,Dozer,2012-01-04 04:25:00,896,"Mental issues, drugs / alcohol to numb the pain, etc. etc.  I persoanlly don't have much experience with homeless people, but from what I hear, 99% can clean up and do better, but choose not too.  The 1% REALLY have had some serious issues that have made them homeless, and because of the ""homelessness"" they've become someone that cannnot be transformed into an everyday average citizen.  This is what my friends who are street level cops tell me, its their experience, not mine.  These people become accustomed to a life of being homeless and thats good enough for them, in the process of being homeless, they start deteriorating and get worse and worse, beyond repair.  Mix drugs and alcohol, lack of support ( not sure ), confidence, and BAM, you're spending the rest of your life on the street.  I know it sounds really nasty, and a lot of you will think I'm rude, I'm sorry, but I can't told that these people have it so hard, blah blah blah, no way!  LIfe's a bugger, sure, not everyone has it easy and not everyone can deal with problems, but really, if stuff really hits the fan, you loose your house for instance, or whatever, and you don't have any friends to help out and support you, then there's somethng wrong with you from the start.  When my friends parents both died when he was young, he starved, had no family to take him, but he realized, damn thats the way things are, life really dealt me a crap hand, and if I don't do something now, I'm screwed.  He didn't give up.  Look at those punk rocker type skids who live on the streets, washing your windows in the summer, most of them are fully functioning young individuals, homeless, why not get a real job?  Life on the street is APPEALING to these clowns.  I told one of them not to clean my windsheild, he proceeded to, and when I didn't give him anything, he lifted up my wiper blade arms, lol. Errrrrr.   I used to be nice and throw money to 'em until a few years back, this really crusty older dude used to beg for change outside of a restaurant for food, people would throw him change, some people would leave doggie bags from their dinners they didn't finish,  I mean, you are asking for money for food right?  When he'd collect enough change, he'd walk off and leave the food behind.  See him drinking in the alley.  My dad was homeless when he came to Canada, he had very little money, no place to stay, no job, no friends, picked up pretty damn well.  But again, everyones different, and there are people who are genuinely homeless, that life just wasn't very fair too, and I feel VERY sad for them. And I do respect people who take time out of their own lives to help others, kudos to them.  But not every homeless person is homeless because they truely had bad experiences, I beleive most of them became homeless and didn't care to do anything about it, or during the time they were homeless, just got comfortable with that lifestyle.  Wait, thats the same thing :/  Sorry if I offended anyone."

Homeless shelters aren't pleasant places.  A lot of them are infested with bedbugs and other things like scabies etc.  A lot of these people are extremely sick and disease spreads easily.  Sure some of them will go there to eat, but rather would brave the cold instead of sleeping there over night.  In a lot of these places they will get robbed by others, including some of the shelter staff.  One homeless guy I have consistently ran into for the past few years says a shelter is the last place you will find him....this coming from someone with nothing was kind of shocking at first, until I learned more about these places. My friends that work at the shelters confirmed all of this stuff I've heard.  It was a real eye opener.  Just my $.02"

And yes, I would take them as a good source, their experiences made them come to these conclusions and they beleive that a lot of them can change.  They're telling me a lot of these people become homeless, and deteriorate ( or get comforatble ) within that lifestyle.  They're addicts and the addiction takes over.  As the years pass by, they start becoming mentally ill, and get worse and worse."
653167,manitoubass2,2012-01-04 05:44:00,11391,"Another thing to consider when discussing the homeless/addictions aspect of things, there is always a story to each case. Some people are addicts before becoming homeless, for some that may in fact what caused their plummet, many I'm sure become addicts after the fact as a coping mechanism, and so on and so forth. This is where the whole categorical stereotype kind of irks me.  Just keep an open mind here for a sec...  Everyone has their vices, EVERYONE! Human behavior has alot to do with our neuro anotomy and our chemical makeup. Everything you do in a day is strongly correlated with how your chemical makeup reacts to the things you are doing, the risk/reward. Alcoholics may experience the same thing neurologically with drinking that another experiences while smoking a cigarette, or having a cup of coffee for that matter. It's all intertwined, you just normally don't realize it...  Now, imagine yourself homeless and on the streets of Toronto. Frustrated because you can't find a job, have no money or place to sleep and your hungry. It all sounds overwhelming, because it is, but thats not the point here. The point is, what is now your risk/reward, and stimulus for  your neurotransmitters???? There really aren't any, are there? This is in large part, why I think the homeless are far more susceptible to addictions and or mental issues (their creating their risk/reward).  Whether anyone wants to admit it, we live to be stimulated. What happens when that is taken away???"
653171,Dozer,2012-01-04 07:00:00,896,"Like I've stated in my original post, I feel very sorry for those people who really had it bad are are genuinely homeless because thats how life turned out for them.  I do not feel sorry for those who have become homeless as a result of them becoming addicted to drugs/alcohol, or their bad decisions and as a result are homeless.  I fought back an addiction myself years ago, if  hadn't of made the right choices, who knows where I'd be.  Could of spiralled out of control for sure.  Drop by the shelter in my neighbourhood, you could buy anything you want, anytime.  And the police are there often.  The city has really tainted my mind.  And I agree with Skip, we should move on until it comes up again."
653172,Big Cliff,2012-01-04 08:57:00,6899,"The American Society of Addiction Medicine begins their definition of addiction by describing it as ""a primary, chronic disease of brain reward, motivation, memory and related circuitry"".  I very much doubt that any of these people got up one morning and said ""I think I'll go out and get myself addicted to something""! Or, I think I'll choose to live in a cardboard box over a grate and sleep on the streets instead of in a nice warm bed with clean sheets and hot food"". Their thinking isn't rational compaired to what you seem to consider ""normal"".  There are many reasons that a person can fall into the traps that lead to them living on the street and once there the climb back up the ladder to what you would consider ""normal"" can be nearly impossible.  Try and get social assistance when you don't have an address, little or no identification, and you have to take drugs or alcohol just to ""feel normal"" or numb the feeling that you aren't ""normal"".  Compound that with possible mental issues or phobias (I know it is a big word, google it, you might learn something if you choose to).  As I see it, there are two important things you still have to learn in life:  Number 1: Before you judge someone, walk a mile in their shoes!  Number 2: A man has a right to look down on someone only when he is helping him to get up!"

Lots of homeless people just fall victim to bad circumstances beyond their control. And once your outta your house, it's really tough to recover. There is a serious lack of help to regain your life. It's almost impossible to retain your job, or find a job. and if you do, it's still a real struggle to continue that job when your half starved, stressed out, emotional, looking after your kids, wondering where to stay etc. All the while people are looking down on you, and insisting drugs or alcohol is what got you where you are.  Just imagine the mental strain? I would imagine it wouldn't take long for ones mental stability to deteriorate. I like to have a few drinks myself, when I think I'm stressed out, I gotta imagine it's sounds even better for a homeless person? A few hours away from the stress. Then in turn, that too may deteriorate your mental ability.  Anyhow, I just feel extreme compassion for my fellow man, and the hard times that can fall on any one of us.  Imagine if we responded the same way to fellow OFC members who have been diagnosed with cancer???  Let's just all help each other out, everyone deserves a good life or the help needed to achieve that..."
