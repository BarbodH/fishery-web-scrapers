654052,Terry,2012-01-06 19:28:00,14456,the smaller and the shallower the lake the more likely it will be safe  all the snow isn't helping either
654068,johnnyb,2012-01-06 20:20:00,3413,"If I were you, I'd have a backup plan....pick a couple smaller lakes in the area, and if Lady M is a no-go, you have somewhere else to go.  Although....someone I know on facebook was posting pics and even though he isn't saying it, he very well may have been on Muskoka last week."
