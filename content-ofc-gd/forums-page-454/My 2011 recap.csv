I wouldn't have known what to do either if it wasn't for this site and the help I received from here. Before this site  was one of the guys that thought bass was the best fish to target. As they are a blast they are by far the best. After catching my first trout my mind was changed and there was much more to come. I still enjoy fishing bass an will always as I fish Lake Erie for most of the summer but will be doing alot more travelling to fish in the future.  Here are some pics to start the year off.        From there I started to target carp yea they aren't the nicest looking fish but damn they sure give a good fight.            After that I started trolling Lake Ontario, this was also something I had not done before. An again due to the help of this site and my grandfather who had fished Lake Ontario for years, I was able to get out and get into some fish.            Here are some of my bass as it was the fish I still targeted the most seeing as my parents live on Erie and I have a boat in the water here all season long.                There are some of my bass the better ones.  I thought I would save my favourite for last. It was another fish that I just started to target this year and to my regret I waited this long. I went for my first musky trip this November and it was awesome after talking with my cousin who has fished musky for years and doing tons of reading and again some help from this site, my friend and I were off to the Kawarthas. I landed my first musky and finished with 3/3 for my first trip. I only have two pictures as my friend has the picture of my first and he is a bit lazy on getting the picture to me.      Thanks for all the help from everyone on this site. If it wasn't for you I would have had just another year full of Bass and Perch. Due to your help I had the best year of fishing yet. An there are only better years to come. Starting with my Musky Opener where I will be spending a week in the Kawarthas again for Opener.  Thanks Again.  Chris."

653754,Live2fish85,2012-01-06 00:03:00,1633,"Thanks guys.  As I said if it weren't for the help from here and lots of reading, I never would have caught half the fish I did this year."
653758,Rod Caster,2012-01-06 00:10:00,5784,I clearly remember your carp reports from the summer. That one slab of mustard is a real beaut!  So is that brown trout.
653761,Live2fish85,2012-01-06 00:21:00,1633,Thanks Chad. Yea that brown and my musky are my favourite fish and the carp is my heaviest fish so far.
653766,Moosebunk,2012-01-06 00:27:00,3970,"Great year Chris.  You know dood, there's just too many fish that swim and so many ways to catch them, you'll find it impossible to not open new doors for yourself and look in to see what's next.  Bass are great fish, carp and trout of all kinds too... next thing you know it'll be something else."
653779,msp,2012-01-06 00:46:00,1336,"Looks like you got into some good ones this year, well done. I have to get me some of those Erie smallies some day !"
653852,Live2fish85,2012-01-06 02:43:00,1633,Thanks guys. MSP when the bass are open again if you want to head out on Erie let me know. I would gladly take you out yo get some Erie Smallmouth. Hopefully some nice ones too.
