653671,paul_614,2012-01-05 19:47:00,168,My guess would be ....no ice
653678,Sandbag,2012-01-05 20:05:00,533,Wide open as of yesterday...  Cheers  Craig
653734,bigugli,2012-01-05 22:42:00,6138,Are you asking about the harbour or the marina? The 2 are very different.
653987,torco,2012-01-06 15:43:00,656,well i drove over the jordon harbour yesterday on my way back from Great Wolf lodge with the family and does not look like it would be safe to ice fish.
654019,uglyfish,2012-01-06 17:41:00,981,there is a thin layer of ice over most of the marina. no where close to safe.
