I have a Lowrance Ifinder H20C but the only NMEA cable available is a 9 pin PC connection.  Does anybody know how to interconnect these or if it is at all possible so the Humminbird can display GPS info? BPS wasn't much help so I was wondering whether to exchange it for a different unit that is compatable.  Thanks,  Peter"

Contact Humminbird, their website has a GPS adapter cable Contact Lowrance, they should have the same or you can make your own.  NMEA is a standard communication protocol.  My Garmin unit has 4 connectors on the back NMEA IN +, NMEA -, NMEA out+ and NMEA out-.  The unit is running NMEA 0183  Humminbird can tell you what the other wires you have are for. the unit Humminbird sells for hooking up to the unit is the GR4 GPS Receiver, its about $100.   forrest"
