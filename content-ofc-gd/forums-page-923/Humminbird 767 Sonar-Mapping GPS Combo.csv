283789,Handlebarz,2008-12-25 12:36:00,3790,I was wondering if anyone has used this unit before and if so how is the gray scale flasher on it? I was thinking of this for the boat and ice fishing.

284204,PERCHER,2008-12-27 01:28:00,787,Shawn the unit on the dash is a 917c and the one on the bow is a 727.The 727 is the same as the 767 with out the mapping.But I have to say you have to luv the Bird. Awesome units.
