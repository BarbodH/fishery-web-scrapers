283483,profisher25,2008-12-24 05:31:00,185,"I am a HUGE fan of Dave Mercer!!!! Y a gotta love Canada's fishing funny man!!!! I have all his DVD series, and always watch his 1 minute facts videos on tv and on the internet. I also tune into the Fatcs of Fishing THE SHOW every saturday and sunday morning at 9 am on THE SCORE!!! ..... I was just curious to see how many fans he has on OFC  ... would every fan like to express how much they love 'The Facts of Fishing""???"
283490,GBW,2008-12-24 06:16:00,8460,"Um, you want a shirt that bad?  Dave is a great angler and is a funny person but what is your goal here?  From the looks of your recent posts you can dig up older posts so I am a bit shocked that you didn't know about the prizes if you post your feedback on the show.  Hey, I missed out too being lazy but a new thread like this, what are you trying to do?  There has been many a post on best show and so on so do you need a shirt that bad?  Don't get me wrong here, I'm not bashing you just trying to figure out your motives as you seam to be able to use the search feature of the site well..."
283497,solopaddler,2008-12-24 09:31:00,8605, I'm guessing he's a youngster  . Nothing wrong with a bit of enthusiasm. Don't you remember getting ramped up over anything fishing related when you were a kid? Man I sure do. I can clearly remember walking into a variety store with my mom at the age of 8 and almost peeing my pants when I found out there were actual magazines devoted to fishing.

283514,diggyj,2008-12-24 12:41:00,548,One of my favourite shows. You must really want a T-shirt bad. Lmao
283517,mikegta,2008-12-24 12:51:00,39,this show makes me want to go out and get a sub LOL great show
283534,mad_on_fishing,2008-12-24 14:38:00,21,"i love to watch facts of fishing the show, and i love to talk to Dave, meeting him in Perth was very exciting for me."
283540,TJQ,2008-12-24 14:53:00,7806,"Profisher...  yes its a great show.. and no worries, you will have plenty of chances to win, we run lots on contests around here.  just stay tuned thats all!"
283541,Radnine,2008-12-24 14:53:00,1538,"I don't subscribe to the WFN, and the basic cable to which I do subscribe does not include the SCORE. I do like to watch the 1 minute tips on the FOF website though. Perhaps I could win a dish instead of a T-shirt so that I could see the show. Jim"
283570,diggyj,2008-12-24 16:34:00,548,I like his commercial on WFN to. I think it's hillarious. That rug on his head and the laugh talking about himself. LMAO
283579,profisher25,2008-12-24 17:05:00,185,"This thread has nothing to do with me wanting a shirt  ,, tho having one would be pretty cool... but I really am a huge fan! thats why i started the ""official facts of Fishing Group"" on facebook! Get more n more ppl to watch his show, i mean,, he always  says on his video blog to get as many people watching his show as possible, so, im helping the guy out!"
283580,profisher25,2008-12-24 17:08:00,185,"Think of me as not only a devoted fisherman, but devoted to my fishing hero!   Fishing is my LIFE!!! Everything in my bedroom has something to do with fishing!!!"
283582,Handlebarz,2008-12-24 17:13:00,3790,Its great to see our youth heading in the right direction I will have to look up the FOF facebook page. Cheers
283602,rbaquial,2008-12-24 17:58:00,968,"I just joined the FACEBOOK group!  Mind you, I'm not all that often on Facebook - and when I am, its only for a short few minutes!!  PS: I too am also a fan of ""Facts of Fishing"" with Dave Mercer - I wanna get his tournament jersey on their website!"
283863,HTHM,2008-12-25 17:27:00,4082,What's facebook????
283990,MCTFisher9120,2008-12-26 02:49:00,3761," lol, i hope your not serious."
284249,lookinforwalleye,2008-12-27 03:46:00,4399,  What rug please don`t telll me that was not his real hair!
284259,Weeds,2008-12-27 04:03:00,782,"I like the show and without having ever met him I'd have to say I like Dave too. But.....waaaay too much product placement. I mean way too much.  It undermines your credibility when every other sentence involves either Rappala, Shimano or Berkley. I still think it's a cool show and I'd love to have the sponsors that he has and I understand he has to pay the bills the same as everyone else but I mean....Sheesh.  I dunno. I liked watching Musky hunter with Jim Saric too until the other day when there was a 5 minute tribute to Ranger boats. Eventually it gets almost insulting. Nothing like paying good money for WFN and getting advertising in return.  Where's that cheese?  P.S. I did enjoy watching him put a good whippin on Scott Martin (Whom I also like)."
284266,pike slayer,2008-12-27 04:12:00,1177,"its a good show and i like to watch but i cant stand daves laugh, everytime he laughs i like to choke him or something to make him stop lol"
284269,MCTFisher9120,2008-12-27 04:20:00,3761," What when did this happen, i need a link or something."
284270,Skud,2008-12-27 04:23:00,739,I watch his show but I am not a fan. I'm getting sick of watching him catch Smallies with a Tube jig 3 out of 4 shows.
284282,GBW,2008-12-27 05:06:00,8460,on the SMC show.  Have a look on the WFN bank of shows...
