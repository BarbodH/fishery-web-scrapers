283082,trapshooter,2008-12-23 03:13:00,1234,"lol @ Phil... boostnawd... that was a loooong time ago back in OFC's early days.  Raf - I'm making plans to be in Southern Ontario at the end of April.  Have a few things on the agenda.... lakers, wild turkeys and buying a truck.      I figure there is a solid 2 week period between the end of ice fishing in northwestern Ontario and the start of my softwater/guiding season.  I find it decidedly convenient that lakers and turkeys fit in that time span."
283085,mistyriver1,2008-12-23 03:24:00,600,"Great year Raf, congrats  Still really like that muskie head shot."

283169,Spiel,2008-12-23 12:02:00,9065,"....Very nice Raf, looks like a good year (again). I guess you you could consider it a perfect year if none of your rods end up in my shop.  oh, when you duck, yeah it'd better be low.....real low."

Your post however is the first i've seen that goes from Ice...to....ice, i am gonna do one soon....but was waiting cuz my fishing year doesn't have an 'end'....it just keeps going, probably have 2 or 3 small outings left before my 'year end'.  you let that Benbeattie in your boat? just kidding.

283015,trapshooter,2008-12-23 00:13:00,1234,Awesome year Raf!  Some truly fantastic fish you guys got into and your wild life shots are always good as well.  That incidental walleye is a tank!!   You gonna be able to get out on the ice over the holidays?  Hope so.  Thanks for not posting the picture of my 'fat pants'! haha.  That weekend is easily one of my favourite annual trips.
283020,ccmtcanada,2008-12-23 00:41:00,7971,Jeez!! Do you ever catch small fish?? LOL.  A great collection of pictures!!!  Looks like you had a good year.

283035,Whopper,2008-12-23 01:28:00,2174,Well done boost
283064,Raf,2008-12-23 02:29:00,3495,"alright some verbage.   that thread was over the minute the pic of moosebunk's arctic char was posted.. but i don't disagree.  love the look of lakers, especially the 'dark' ones.  their fins are such a brilliant white - pics don't do them justice.   Does that mean we'll see ya somewhere around 4/20?   thanks Cliff.. this is a year end thread & they didn't make the cut lol.  bear with me here a lil  Not taking anything away from 08, great company, great water and fish were caught.  However, looking back over the year, we didn't boat any real giants and it was a tough year in the sense that it seemed we always had to work for fish.  Whether it was wind, brutal cold, oppressive heat, post-cold front bluebird skies, or unusually high water levels - it was an odd year.  It re-affirmed my belief that I need to get rich & retire and/or find a rich wife so I can pick my days instead of being a wknd warrior  .  I think a few pics tell an interesting tale in that they were taken during low light.  We did quite a bit of fishing (and were succesful) before or after the sun was up, right out of your playbook .  We spent a few hours on shore with brown pops and/or catching some zzz's due to the heat or wind in the day.  Fish smarter not neccessarily harder.  I'm not sure I am sold yet but, the solunar calendar was quite often 'right' too as a few of the fish in the pics were caught during 'prime' periods.   thanks! best of luck in '09 to you too.   Thanks for the blast from the past, Phil.  No snail on the Jeep though.. (yet???)"
