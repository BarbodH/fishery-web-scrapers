283321,MCTFisher9120,2008-12-23 20:55:00,3761,Ouch
283328,muskeybugged,2008-12-23 21:03:00,282,"I had seen that before, but this time I noticed what I think was the release of blood pressure in the guy's artery where he was bit.  Could be water splashing around but it had a tinge of red. @ the :47 mark (GRAPHIC)"
283342,diggyj,2008-12-23 21:45:00,548,Looks worse then it probably is. Flesh wound.
283391,DRIFTER_016,2008-12-24 00:32:00,10439, It's only a flesh wound!!!! Come back and fight like a man!!!!!  
283425,fishindevil,2008-12-24 01:41:00,6254,"WOW...thats gotta hurt man !!!!   thanks for sharing,i seen a clip of a lobster latching on to a guys hand after he stuck it in the tank to poke at him !!! and it almost cut his finger off!! it had him for at least a minute or 2 and his claw was huge as well,and i know that hurt big time,i will try to find it,im not sure if it was you-yube or not....thanks for the laugh..."
283572,Dozer,2008-12-24 16:52:00,896,... it appears as if the dude just kept holding onto the pike while it wanted to thrash away and it swung around and latched onto the dudes hand...  I'd say it the guys fault!  Am I stating the obvious?  I do that a lot :|
283575,joonmoon,2008-12-24 17:00:00,528,Guess he should have torpedoed that fish...hahaha.
283603,FisherMike,2008-12-24 17:59:00,108,ive seen this one before.  if you look really closely you will see that its actually a bigger pike that came and grabbed the small one being released.  pretty crazy.
283636,spyder3g,2008-12-24 20:52:00,50,"The same happened to me at Mountsberg last May before the season was opened. I got 3 stitches in the hospital. However, the pike was just about 3Lb. The lesson â€“ do not fish until the season."
284293,profisher25,2008-12-27 06:09:00,185,It happened soo quickly!
284294,profisher25,2008-12-27 06:09:00,185,"then again, it could happen to anyone"
284295,profisher25,2008-12-27 06:10:00,185,still though ...  not good
284313,DMASSE,2008-12-27 12:55:00,420,"Your right  It was another pike thAT grabbed the one being released,  VERY cool  Dave"
284408,fishboy,2008-12-27 18:57:00,550,I wouldn't be surprised if the cut came from a fin.
