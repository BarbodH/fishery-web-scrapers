284333,danbo,2008-12-27 14:35:00,2646,Fishable. Dead-drift a single-egg or SanJuan worm. Use a strike indicator & don't drift under them.
284344,kemper,2008-12-27 15:39:00,2232,"  Nope, sorry bud.  NOT fishable in your wildest dreams.  I hit three tribs today, dangerous and unfishable.  Stay in bed, give it three days or so and it should br prime"
284346,danbo,2008-12-27 15:41:00,2646,Yo Kempy where you on Georgian Bay?
284347,kemper,2008-12-27 15:43:00,2232,"no sir, I guess I was just assuming this dude meant the east tribs.  Its messy out here, very messy"
