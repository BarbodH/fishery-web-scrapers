And since I have to work on the 2nd, I figure that a day trip on the 1st will be about as good as it gets...my question is...where would you go if it were you? Simcoe, Scugog or Dunnville? Of course, if ice conditions are no good, I either won't go, or will just leave the party early New Year's morning and drive further north, but I'd prefer not to. So, good ol' OFC community, let me know what your choice would be...or give me some other suggestions...please"
