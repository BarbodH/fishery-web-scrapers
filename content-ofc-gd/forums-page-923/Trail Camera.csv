I was wondering if anyone could recomend a good trail cam not to cheap but not to expensive either say under $250.00. That would be good for both day and night, don't want to go to cheap as I don't want to have to buy another to soon and it's more for hobby purposes. I work at a fishing resort on Lake Of The Woods and thought it would be a great way to hopefully get some neat wildlife pics. Most days are just to busy to go out and walk the bush and days off when I can are for fishing and sleeping. Also any place where I could pick one up in Peterborough or London would be great. I know Canadian Tire has some but I am really not sure what to look for.  Thank you"

284308,Beats,2008-12-27 12:18:00,543,I just bought my dad a Scoutguard for Christmas. I spent a lot of time researching and reading reviews and it seems to get teh highest all around reviews.  It's also so small that you can use it in almost any application and it won't be seen.  Some ppl use them as security cams or to catch trespassers on their property because they are just so small that ppl don't see them.  Check out http://www.chasingame.com and check out their reviews and forums to help you decide what's best for you.

Do not know anything about this specific brand, or any other models or anything, but it seems that the 4 megapixel ones are the way to go with an SD card option. Battery life in low temps are supposedly quite good also, but if no game comes into camera range for extended periods of time, then the units seem to last quite long. The unit probably goes into some kind of sleep mode until activity is recognized by the IR receiver."
