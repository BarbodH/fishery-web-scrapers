Heres the words:  Brandi – Looking Glass     There’s a port  On a western bay  And it serves a hundred ships a day  Lonely sailors pass the time away  And talk about their homes    And there’s a girl  In this harbor town  And she works, layin’ whiskey down  They say Brandi, fetch another round  She serves them whiskey and wine.    The sailors say Brandi  You’re a fine girl  What a good wife you would be  Yeah your eyes could steal the sailors  From the sea.    Brandi wears a braided chain  Made of finest silver from the north of Spain  A locket, that bears the name  Of the man that Brandi loves    He came on a summer’s day  Bringin’ gifts, from far away  But he made it clear, he couldn’t stay  The harbor was his home.    The sailors say Brandi  You’re a fine girl  What a good wife you would be  But my life, my love and my lady  Is the sea    Yeah Brandi used to watch his eyes  When he told his sailor stories  She could feel the ocean fall and rise  She saw its rage and glory  But he had always told the truth  Lord he was an honest man  And Brandi doesn’t fail to understand.    At Night when the bars close down  Brandi walks through a silent town  And loves a man who’s not around  She can still hear him say  She hears him say Brandi, You’re a fine girl  What a good wife you would be but my life, my love and my lady is the sea."
