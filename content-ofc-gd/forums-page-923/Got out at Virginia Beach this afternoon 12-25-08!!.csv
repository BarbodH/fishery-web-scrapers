Caught a dozen perch with 8 keepers.  Only saw two other people out there .  They were on their way in as I got out there.  One said he was a member of the Simcoe Board and this board as well.  He said his name was ""slyatv"" .  They looked to have done well.  Not sure how long they were out though.  As my excursion was decided last minute I had no minnows and they offered me some and thats what I caught them with.  I used a panfish / pickeral rig and got about 4 on that and I got the rest on  small teardrop lures tipped with the minnows.  The conditions were decent.  A bit of slush on some spots but nothing too thick.  Nothing more then about 2 or 3 inches but I was on foot.  Everywhere I popped holes there was at least 5 to 8 inches of good ice.  High chance I will go again tomorrow morning.  Anyone else gonna be out there?  If so I'll be wearing a big green worksuit.  Cheersand Merry Christmas everyone."

283983,tapout,2008-12-26 02:36:00,166,"Hey Terry,  yeah I saw a couple ski-doos out there and sly was useing his Wilcraft - http://www.thewilcraft.com/the_vehicle.php.  Looked like it could be kinda heavy and he didn't break throught anywhere I can see although he did find a few slushy spots, usually where there was a small snow drift.  The Georgina Island Ferry is still running so stay FAR away from its path.  The Chippewa's have a sign posted at the access by the Virginia Beach Marina saying this should be used as an emergency route only and ice conditions aren't safe but from what I can see no probs out there.  As for Saturday, it doesn't look good.  High of around +10 and rain.  Tomorrow looks good though.  Cheers,  Tony."
