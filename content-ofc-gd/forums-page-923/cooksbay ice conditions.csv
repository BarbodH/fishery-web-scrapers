283791,Big Cliff,2008-12-25 12:47:00,6899,"Haven't been out but judging from the conditions here on Sturgeon lake I wouldn't be going out either. Snowing so hard here right now I can't see the other side of the lake and there is several inches of slush covering everything I can see, not a good combination. They are now calling for +10Â°C for Saturday with 25-35mm of rain It will be a few more weeks before I'll venture out on the ice."

Hopefully this warm spell and rain only melt off the snow, which is likely since the night temps are still going to be below zero. BTW there was 6-8 inches of ice on little lake and we managed to land 5 pike and missed a bunch. A slow day for this lake but still a great first ice fishing trip of the season."
