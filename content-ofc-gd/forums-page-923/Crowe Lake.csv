Sorry I can't be more specific but if you are going make sure you have water proof boots. Nothing ruins a good day fishing faster than wet feet this time of the year."

I suppose if I had a floater suit and a buddy with a rope, and a http://www.thewilcraft.com/the_vehicle.php ,  I might venture out there.  Alas, I have none of those.  Thanks for the replys"
