283798,maybe,2008-12-25 13:27:00,307,"There you go...asked and answered.  I was up til 4 finishing the annual fishing photo albums for Jeff's grandmother.  Our boat was her late husband's pride & joy, and the two of them really enjoyed fishing.  She's too frail to come out with Jeff & I much, so I do books full of 8x10s to try to make her feel included.  Thank god I'm better with a Canon than a spinner.  Up next:  wrapping the gifts that don't get delivered until tonight/tomorrow.  Happy Hohos, everybody!"
