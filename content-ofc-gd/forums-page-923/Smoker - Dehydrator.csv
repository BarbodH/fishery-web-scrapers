283945,Mike Pike,2008-12-25 23:34:00,1332,"I dunno Wayne, I think if that boyfriend of hers was looking to score some serious points with you, he'd offer the smoker to you!  You can hope, anyway!  lol"
284012,Fang,2008-12-26 03:56:00,1330,"Wow Wayne,  there some skill building there. Some of us that have been plying the hobby trade for years would be hard pressed for a finished piece that nice  Let her know I've already saved those pitures and will be planning out a similar build for this summer. I'm looking at picking up a small propane hibachi to use as my burner and then building the box around the bottom half of the bbq.  Where'd she/ya get the grills? Save me from looking around if I can get right to the source."
284014,irishfield,2008-12-26 04:09:00,26272,"Paul... pretty sure she got the grills in Walmart and then built the cedar ""box"" to suit their width. I'll ask her tomorrow when she's home. She's gone for the rest of the night.  It doesn't really show well sitting on that carpet... but in the bottom.. that's a piece of ""cement"" board, that you would use behind shower tiles. There to take the heat from a burner or similar.  She's not really happy with the end product.. but she never is, even with every screw hole counterbored and plugged etc. I can never get my head wrapped around that kind of detail... lol"
284017,Fang,2008-12-26 04:35:00,1330,"construction is 10% of any project, finishing is the other 90%. I try and put as much time in the sanding and coating stages as in cutting and assembly.  I've been looking at the pictures trying to figure out the bottom for heat resistance. I'd figure I'd just use some ceramic tile but the cement board is a great idea. Single peice cut to fit and very heat durable. I'll adapt to replace the cedar with plywood I get free from my brothers work. Real high end stuff used for cardboard box dies.  Will check Walmart for the grills  Thx Wayne"
284019,douG,2008-12-26 04:57:00,2693,"I'm not at home, but check back issues of Outdoors Canada or Ontario Out of Doors, since one of those had detailed plans including a cut list and joinery details for a smoker that looks much like Wayne's future son-in law's."
283711,irishfield,2008-12-25 04:12:00,26272,Thought some of you may like this.... my youngest (20) daughter built this for her boyfriend for Christmas. It's up to him what he wants to do with it from here... put a heat source in it for dehydrating .. or get a smoker unit to attach to the side...or both. Seeing how nice this came out... kicking my ass I passed when she asked if I wanted one built as well !
283712,BassAsin,2008-12-25 04:16:00,806,"very good lookin job, i bet your kickin your butt now!!!"
283715,douG,2008-12-25 04:36:00,2693,"Wayne, that's just a gorgeous piece of cabinetry.  It reminds me of the plans I looked at in either OC or OOD magazine.  She seems to be a very capable young lady.  Goodonya, you have every right to be proud of her.  You don't need to ask her to make one for you.  Just have the lucky guy marry her.  Easy.  Never mind, it looks like that's gonna happen anyway, no stoppin that train."
283717,irishfield,2008-12-25 04:42:00,26272,"Thanks Doug, all she had was a page from a mag showing a picture, no plans..... and yah.. he needs her anyhow, someone has to fillet his fish ! lol  "
283719,BassAsin,2008-12-25 04:45:00,806,"my buddies need to get one like her, i hate cleaning my fish and then theirs!"
283724,Joey,2008-12-25 05:03:00,9122,Sweet!!!  That's a nice unit for sure.  She must get her talent from Leah's side of the family  Joey
283726,Leecher,2008-12-25 05:17:00,7832,Wayne you shouldn't of    pass.... look at it I'm sure if you ask your daughter nicely that she'll build you one Leechman
283728,HTHM,2008-12-25 05:34:00,4082,"Seeing her acomplishments is better pride builder than your own, eh! I'd have trouble walkin through a door my chest would be out so far."
283730,douG,2008-12-25 05:45:00,2693,"Joey, she certainly has her mother's beautiful eyes and charming smile."
283734,Fishmaster,2008-12-25 05:56:00,920,"You have raised a very beautiful woman, who seems to have a huge heart... Lots of love went into the building of that smoker/dehydrator... evident in how well it turned out.  That is one lucky man to have found himself such a thoughtful woman!  Merry Christmas  Jen"
283759,Big Cliff,2008-12-25 10:53:00,6899,"A beautifully built smoker/dehydrator, a gorgeous young lady, and a smile that lights up everything around her. What a priceless combination!"
283762,Terry,2008-12-25 11:19:00,14456,"wow, it looks great"
283770,Spiel,2008-12-25 11:47:00,9065,"....I'm impressed! Your daughter has done an amazing jod Wayne, it looks absolutely beautiful."
283780,b2kptbo,2008-12-25 12:14:00,1505,"Very cool, well done..."
283867,Mattones,2008-12-25 17:39:00,587,Did she do this in Woodshop at school? or do you have all the tools yourself?  She did a great job! has an eye for perfection.
283869,irishfield,2008-12-25 17:47:00,26272,"SHE.. has all the tools herself Matonnes! Some of mine creep to her end of my shop from time to time.... but generally she's asked for power tools for the last 4 or 5 years for Christmas/birthdays. Has her own table saw, router table, mitre saw.. etc.  She's a strange one it seems.... in third year Architectural Engineering and been building stuff from wood since grade 7 or 8. Built her Mother a roll top desk for Christmas about 4 years ago.  "
283870,Terry,2008-12-25 17:53:00,14456,"wow, she built that when we was 16 year old...that is talent"
283871,paul_614,2008-12-25 17:59:00,168,Your daughter has some skills
283884,fishindevil,2008-12-25 19:00:00,6254,"Awesoem looking smoker wayne !!!   she has talent thats for sure,she should be a cabinet maker !!!! pays very well too,so when can we order ours...LOL..LOL  .. merry christmas man..to you leah & your family..."
283890,Guest steel'n'esox,2008-12-25 19:31:00,0,"Wow bet she could carve up some great looking musky baits as well, those are amazing pieces of wood working craftmanship. very well done"
283894,bigugli,2008-12-25 19:36:00,6138,"You've raised up a mighty fine daughter. I'd be as  proud as a peacock with a daughter so talented ( mine's pretty creative too). Hard part is making sure the guy she pairs up with is worthy. I'm surprised the young hounds on OFC aren't lined up banging on your door.  I use a variation of the ""parents rules for dating"" quite frequently."
283897,jwl,2008-12-25 19:46:00,1056,"that's sure is one excellent piece of work there, are you sure if you had one you would want to actually use it??..maybe you could get one..keep yours clean, and use his  ..you should start making fun of that boy a bit more if your daughter has to clean his fish for him too...I wouldn't let him in your boat if I was you"
283907,Mattones,2008-12-25 20:47:00,587," haha  I wonder where all my power tools went. I bought a router, tablesaw, jointer, etc. Must be buried under my paintball guns and extra framing tools."
283908,BillM,2008-12-25 20:52:00,17367,"Wayne, time to get her a ShopSmith so she can turn you some muskie lures"
283938,2 tone z71,2008-12-25 23:01:00,1311,"Dammm if I was only 20 again, lol JK Wayne ,Merry Christmas great workmanship"
