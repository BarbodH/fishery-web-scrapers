283746,Victor,2008-12-25 07:49:00,1609,Merry Xmas to all!  The thing that sucks though is you can't use your 10% membership card for sale items I believe.
283754,forrest,2008-12-25 09:43:00,1032, Too much nog Victor. As original poster and link show the 10% and no tax can be combined.  December 26th only.  I wonder what they have for stock?  forrest
283833,young_one,2008-12-25 15:08:00,620,"Hey Vic, I believe, sale items are always 10% with club member, while the special on 26th its like almost 23%? (or, no-tax plus 10% off!)"
283855,T Fisher,2008-12-25 16:43:00,139,La baron you say..... think your getting a deal eh! Here's the proof I'd been watching the Vexilar FL18 and a Floater suit for my Son this was last year. Having full intentions of buying both on boxing day to save a few $$$$$ wouldn't you know it the price went up $35 on the suit and $60 on the Vex. The price on both items was change the day b-4 x-mass. But low and behold a week later both items were reduced to ther original price. Ever wonder why they use that old cash register with the old stick on sticker pricing. MAKES YOU WANT TO SAY ????????
283856,forrest,2008-12-25 16:43:00,1032,"From the back of the card:  ""Club discounts are not applicable during promotional events or on items already on sale""  but  The linked sales brochure is making an exception.  forrest"
283859,Terry,2008-12-25 16:58:00,14456,"yeah I agree, it's tax free plus the 10%  Wish I had extra money kicking around, great savings and my membership card runs out at the end of the month so now would be the time to buy"
283873,Victor,2008-12-25 18:04:00,1609,Uh i guess i was wrong. I might stop by lebaron tomorrow then   $$$$$$  Happy boxing day shopping!
283875,forrest,2008-12-25 18:08:00,1032, That is something to watch out for.  Blatantly illegal too.  Did you call them on it?  forrest
283891,Terry,2008-12-25 19:31:00,14456,"I am still trying to figure out about them marking the price up I always look at their catalog and  know the right price before I walk into the store, I have never seen the price more then in the book"
