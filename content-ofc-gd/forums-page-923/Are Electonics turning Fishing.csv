284075,Jigger,2008-12-26 17:08:00,1237,"Danbos comment regarding ice fishing would seem like common sense to me. As far as soft water goes, I try and do as much research as I can before hitting the water with maps, weather patterns, books on fish behavior and talking to other anglers. Try and get as many different maps of the area you´re going to be fishing and whittle down the spots you intend to try first and form some semblance of a gameplan. Theres always something that will make you change that gameplan along the way. But without that primary research, especially on new water you´re starting out guessing and could be wasting valuable time trying inappropriate methods to achieve your goal of catching fish. Once you are on the water, as far as gadgets go, a FF is ahead of a trolling motor IMO. Then trolling motor followed by a GPS. On bigger water with lots of unfamiliar water, a GPS isn´t a requirement. But more time to learn the water is. Just have to quadrant reeally big water and saturate the area to learn it. That being said, there are times when I really wished I had a GPS to explore a small hump that was a potential goldmine only to search for a long time and discover that it was devoid of fish and could have spent my time more wisely if I could have found the spot right away. One final point would be in regard to money fishermen. If I was one, I would want every tool I could get my hands on. I think in the end, it really boils down to what you´re looking to get out of a day on the water and how you feel most comfortable achieving that goal."
284093,danbo,2008-12-26 18:02:00,2646,Another good trick is to pick one lake & really get to know it.
284096,pike slayer,2008-12-26 18:24:00,1177,"the only thing i got is a gps for getting me in and out of lakes. i dont use a fish finder or flasher or anything. a fish finder is only good for depths not anything else. i look for spots ice fishing but the shore line, i can find drop offs, points and shoals. i always seem to do good. if i dont do that well then i go back, i know they are there. its a whole game finding the fish in its self. you take the fun out using all those gizmos!"
284192,fishindevil,2008-12-27 01:05:00,6254,"  Afish finder is only good for depths !!!!....YA OK...not like mine shows the thermalcline,or my cannonballs for downrigger tracking,or detecting rock bottom,or mud/sand combo,for bottom bouncing for walleyes ...no they are no good for anything else,are they !!!! Hmmmm lets see you go get me a few big king salmon,and follow the temperature breaks,and follow baitfish !!!! well what do i know about fish finders,they only find depth nothing else,check a few of my posts and you will see what they can see !!!!"
284195,fishindevil,2008-12-27 01:15:00,6254,                        and for the finnally   ready.....  
284227,DANIMAL,2008-12-27 02:30:00,215,What you see on fishing electronics is reality. Thats what separates them from video games.
284251,pike slayer,2008-12-27 03:47:00,1177,"i just walk down to the st.marys and catch more then enough kings then i'll ever want. i fish small inland lakes, i feel no real need for a finder. i always do decent, i never got skunked once this year and i tried alot of new lakes. and as i said its more fun and more of a game going to a lake blind. my buddy has a fishfinder like yours and we used it once and we used it for about ten minutes. i never fish the great lakes maybe they are more useful out there."
283913,danbo,2008-12-25 21:23:00,2646,I'm wondering what Grampa would say?

283918,Terry,2008-12-25 21:35:00,14456,"well sometimes when I am watching my underwater camera, I forget to fish.. and if's fun to see them on the camera and fishfinder, so even if it is turning Fishing, into a Virtual Reality Game, it's all good"
283919,Rich,2008-12-25 21:47:00,3927,Sure beats Guitar Hero!
283920,forrest,2008-12-25 21:49:00,1032,Fiishfinders make the fishing experience a lot better in situations.  When the skunk is on and I see all those fish down below I feel better knowing that it was skill and not chance that was keeping me from catching.  I feel more motivated to go out the next time.  GPS: allows more fishing to take place during the day and increases the learning curve.  Nothing worse is the blind leading the blind around a lake.  That being said fishing is lazily pleasant and a fun puzzle to figure out.  forrest
283921,forrest,2008-12-25 21:52:00,1032,Oh yeah....Grandpa kicks butt more than any electronics....
283923,hammercarp,2008-12-25 21:54:00,964,I have often felt that thier use should only allowed on bodies of water over a certain size. They do make it possible to fish-out smaller lakes.
283924,MCTFisher9120,2008-12-25 21:57:00,3761,"nope, all i got is my rubber boat and some tackle...no gps, fish finders...find weeds,find bass. Easy as that!"
283925,aniceguy,2008-12-25 21:58:00,1094,  lol speak for your self been playing it with the kids all day......
283926,danbo,2008-12-25 22:14:00,2646,Rock & Roll brothers!
283931,fishindevil,2008-12-25 22:35:00,6254,"Wayne your sign says it all bro !!!!.  ..my grandad ran a fishing loge for over 35yrs,long before any fish graphs or GPS !!!!...and he always found the fish,and knew by the weather,and certain signs in mother nature,when & where they would be at any time of the year !!! even the M.N.R. used to contact my gramps about net placement and for taging and stuff,he used to always amaze me when i was a kid...so i was lucky enough to learn old school as well as the new way with all the gadgets & gizmos....but ya know you can have all the fancy stuff you want but if the fish sometimes wont bite,well no gadgets can make them,and with todays time constraints,and busy life,i wish i had all the time in the world to fish,but i dont,so those gadgets help me narrow down,and refine the search for my fishing time on the water !!!!....and i really do think i could still be a succesful fisherman without all the goodies !!! it would just be longer & harder,but im stubborn so it would be ok !!!...cheers"
283933,danbo,2008-12-25 22:45:00,2646,Good points..guess I'm getting a Portable Sonar for my Kayak tomorrow!
283957,Handlebarz,2008-12-26 00:39:00,3790,I grew up with a compass to get ya back to shore if the fog rolled in on LSC we never used anything else until dad got a plug to tell ya what the temp was at the end of the string.  Living in Sudbury we would find structure and fish it but I tell ya it was great when the later 80's came around and we bought the first fish finder it sure did make life alot easier we could hold the structure and breaks I love them and am getting more this coming year.  I would rather play virtual reality on the water then on the couch bring on the new gadgets we cant have enough.
283960,kemper,2008-12-26 00:58:00,2232,"I have no fishfinder, sonar, GPS any of that crap.  I catch fish..."
283965,forrest,2008-12-26 01:25:00,1032, I am trying to recall the number of of boat caught fish pics vs shore fish caught by Kemper.
283969,bigugli,2008-12-26 01:32:00,6138,I like having sonar. Especially on new water to find the striucture and contours and that is all. Don't need it for much else. Nothing beats what you learn hands on from your betters and through experience.
283971,Stoty,2008-12-26 01:36:00,2910,Not much else to do in Mommy's basement eh Danbo.
283973,Rich,2008-12-26 01:47:00,3927, Me too. Doesn't mean I wouldn't use it if I had it!
283976,glen,2008-12-26 01:55:00,2641,Leave some sport in sport fishing.
283980,MCTFisher9120,2008-12-26 02:19:00,3761,"No all boats are equipted with GPS, and fish finders..."
284003,forrest,2008-12-26 03:37:00,1032,   What does that mean MTBF?  I was only noticing that I can't recall Kemper ever posting a pic of a fish he caught on a boat.....I guess one could use a fishfinder in a running river  Why wouldn't someone equip their owned boat with a FF or GPS ?  When they -fish from shore most of time -can't justify the cost of one -know the lake well -fish small areas only -fish rivers -fish infrequently -oh yeah...fly fishing guys  Who is fishing a large body of water without either a GPS or fishfinder to make it more sporting?    forrest
284009,MCTFisher9120,2008-12-26 03:45:00,3761," lol, well he's beside a boat in his avatar, close enough"
284025,danbo,2008-12-26 11:26:00,2646,I found my answer on Ice Shanty forum..  alright put it like this... u DONT have a flasher u walk out on a lake and drill a hole and sit..is there anyfish there? are u in weeds? or a rocky bottom ? u wont ever know b/c u dont have one..  some one else walks out on the lake they drill a hole and put there vex in and they see no fish so they move on till they find them wile u sit there with ur thumb up ur @$$.. i wont go fishing with out mine..
284039,fishdawg,2008-12-26 14:26:00,912,"Navionics, Vexilar, & Sub Troll sorry but the limited time i have out on the water i want to use it as efficiently as I can"
