Hit it 3 times with two 20-30 fish days on it last season but they were on the small side... hoping they've grown up a bit! Have another lake that looks to be gold for brookies... can't get to it just yet, unless we want to hike about 12k.  Was looking through my pics from the last year.. here's a few for those that haven't been out yet but are looking to scratch the itch!  Getting a ""feel"" for a new lake.. that's a partner in crime setting up shop in the distance.       A freshly rigged splake trap set in virgin snow...         Not too many fish pics, but yes... we did get a few of these.  "
