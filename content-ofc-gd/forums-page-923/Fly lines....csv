So lets get to it, I got a big gift card to Wilsons in T.O and I need to purchase my gear. Im going on a 7wt, and an orvis Battenkill LA III trout reel. Does anyone have any suggestions on what line I should use. I was told that a weight forward line would be good and I am looking at this one...  http://www.wilsonstoronto.com/ProductDetai...ue/Default.aspx  thanks everyone, TTYS Marcus"
