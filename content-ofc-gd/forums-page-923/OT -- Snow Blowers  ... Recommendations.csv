282848,charlesn,2008-12-22 16:53:00,551,"I asked for advice last year and got the same great advice.  Ended up not having much choice and bought the 10.5 HP Yardworks one that Spiel posted a link for as they had just gotten a shipment in and everyplace else was sold out.  I paid more than what it appears to be selling for now, but it was worth every penny to me.  I am really really happy with it.  Now if I can figure out a way to get it in to the bed of my pick up truck so that I can do my parent's driveway life would be good.  Charles"
282861,lookinforwalleye,2008-12-22 17:37:00,4399,"I am looking for one now as well to bad I can`t find find one, you would think living in a snow belt the dealers in the area would have lots of stock but every year they are sold out."
282865,ctdd2006,2008-12-22 17:47:00,531,Go to sears.ca and type in 52839 into the search engine.  These are available now!  Also the 52848.  I've got a dozen available to me as a dealer store and so should most others.
282885,Big Cliff,2008-12-22 18:21:00,6899,"Get a set of ramps, drive it right up and in.  One of the things I have noticed in almost all equipment is that with proper maintainance almost all of it will last a long time! One other observation: people that pay more for their equipment tend to take better care of it! Maybe that is why more expensive equipment lasts longer????"
282890,Roy,2008-12-22 18:42:00,13728, I got the exact same unit delivered to my door by Sears in mid November. I also paid almost $500 LESS than the posted price in that link. It works great...very well built.
282891,charlesn,2008-12-22 18:52:00,551," Hello Big Cliff,  I'm not sure what you mean.  Is there a ramp system I can go to Home Depot/Rona/CT and buy?  I was assuming I would have to fabricate something and I'm about the least handy person in the world so I've held off.  Powertools and me usually involve emergency room visits and lectures.  The most dangerous tool I'm allowed to use is the Hercules hook.  lol  Sorry to hijack the thread, would just like to help the parents out so if there is a ramp type system, I'm sure some others would be interested to know as well.  Charles"
282894,Big Cliff,2008-12-22 18:59:00,6899,"Go to CTC, you want ATV ramps, they are aluminum, light weight, strong, and easy to use. Most ATV dealers will have them too!"
282899,Twocoda,2008-12-22 19:17:00,4130,the ramps from ctc will run you $300 for a set of aluminium or around $ 200.00 for steel ramps...( very heavy)....two pieces of 2x6x10 works perfctly for loading and unloading my machine in the back of my fullsize Dodge...ive never had a problem ...
282931,Fisherman,2008-12-22 20:47:00,7201,"Everyone forgetting Princes Auto, you can get reasonably priced ramps there for the same price of some unreasonably priced 2x6's."
282939,diggyj,2008-12-22 20:59:00,548,Just make sure it has an electris start. Makes life simple.
282961,charlesn,2008-12-22 22:25:00,551,Thanks for the advice.  I'll look at Princess Auto for the ramps.
282966,Billy Bob,2008-12-22 22:37:00,5865,"I have a Toro 24 inch 7 hp for the last 27 years now. Nicknamed ""Big Red"" goes through ANYTHING and we get more than most in the Buffalo area. But I did have to replace the spark plug once.  I really think a snowblower is a better investment than a lawn mower. You can go weeks if you have to without cutting your grass but try to get out of your driveway to go to work in the morning after a storm hit during the night. That's when you really appreciate that snowblower.  Get whatever kind you like but don't get a snow thrower and for God's sake not a electric one at that like the dumb neighbor across the street."
282981,boatman,2008-12-22 23:08:00,350,"I agree with the statement that anything from a major manufacturer with proper maintenance should be fine. Too bad about Tecumseh they made a good motor. I heard it was coming, but I hoped someone would step in and buy them up or something.  Last fall I bought a 1990's MTD built CTC snowblower 26"" 2-stage, 6 forward 2 reverse speeds. Its was originally an 8 hp, but someone swapped in a 10 hp Tecumseh Snow King. The motor was blown when I got it. I mean busted rod and a hole in the block so big I could just about pull the piston out of it. I don't know what the fella before me did to this thing to cause it to blow two power plants. Aside from not changing or checking the oil there is really no good reason for it. Everything is belt driven and easy to maintain. In fact, I just changed the auger belts on Sunday and it took about 10 minutes not counting the trip to Home Depot to get them.  The motor was easy to replace. Lots of brand new motors or short blocks around for a reasonable price. I picked up a brand new 10 hp Tecumseh Snow King motor for $270 and dropped it on. This is my second season with it and it works great. Throws snow heavy or wet as far as you could want. I'm sure there are better machines, but for the price I couldn't imagine getting anything else."
282999,BillM,2008-12-22 23:39:00,17367,My 20inch Ariens was great last season and no hiccups yet this season.  I love the fact that I can prime the balls 2 or 3 times and pull it once and she fires right up.  I used the electric start only once this year (When my dumbass forgot to drain the tank at the end of last season)
283175,musky_man,2008-12-23 12:49:00,159,Thanks again for all your thoughts - much appreciated.
283861,JohnF,2008-12-25 17:11:00,3494," A final post in defence of tiny snoblowers. We've had a lot of snow the last few days here and my little unit has been great with it. Granted I had more fun using my son's big 30"" 10.5 hp after I fixed his ground drive but for the price and the space it takes up this 5.5 hp 22"" cut is awesome. All the snow behind me (compliments of the city plow has been moved by the the little red blower in front of me. It takes a bit longer but it does the job, and as I said before, I can pick it up and put it in the back of the suv by myself to go to my Mom's place.  That being said, if I had lotsa room in the garage, I'd still have the big blower.  "
282375,Dutch,2008-12-21 17:23:00,831,"Just went through the buying process myself....  Do you need a 2 stage?  If you have a large driveway (6-8 cars plus in any configuaration), you may need a 2 stage.  You also need a 2 stage if you have a gravel driveway or a driveway with a big slope, or get a lot of very heavy, deep snowfalls.  Otherwise ALWAYS buy a single stage.  They clean down to the pavement, are much easier to move around, no fooling with gears and they are much, much faster than a 2 stage.  I was cleaning up after the recent storms and I had my driveway done whereas my neighbour had 3 strips of his done in the same time using a 10HP ""lug.""  Granted, single stage aren't as wide (mine is 21""), or as high, but they are quicker.  Also mine has no problems with the thick stuff at the end of the driveway.  When I was researching, the names I heard continually were - Ariens, Honda, Toro and Lawnboy (owned by Toro).  I don't think you can go wrong with any of those.  I ended up with a Lawnboy single stage and I love it so far.  You get what you pay for.....  As you can see, most people will reccomend what they own, especially if they've not had any problems or issues with them.  Do your own research and see what names come up continually, then make a decision based on that.  P.S. - when doing my reasearch, I read that HP doesn't mean a whole lot with respect to snow blowers, many of the larger manufacturers are now omiting that information in exchange for ft/lbs. of torque, which apparently is a more telling stat.  I think it is becuase a 10HP engine on a 300 pound blower is a lot different than a 10 H.P. engine on a machine that weighs 100 pounds."
282500,pikehunter,2008-12-21 22:06:00,1659," I noticed that when I looked over this years snowblower line up. They are all described by engine displacement rather than H.P rating.  You have received some good advise about maintenance. If you are looking for one right now good luck! Most stores are sold out. Ancaster Home Depot had a shipment the other day, 15 of them, but I think they were all presold."
282593,Sinker,2008-12-22 00:21:00,8692,"I've been running a 24"" toro single stage for as long as I can remember. My dad had it forever, and then it got passed on to me. Other than changing a belt every 4-5 years, and regular maintenance, its been flawless. It will throw snow over my 6' fence and into the ditch on the other side......no kidding!! Its not the fastest machine going, but it works very well, and is easy to operate!  I takes 3 pulls every time to start, and runs like a champ always. I've had it up at the cottage in march, and the drive was never cleared all winter. This thing ate up the 3ft of hard snow like it was nothing......right down to the the gravel.....it still blows my mind every time I use it. If I ever need another one, its gonna be a toro fer sure!!! Its all steel too......the only plastic on it is the gas cap  At work we have a John Deere. Its a good unit too, but its mounted on a small diesel tractor. From what the guys tell me, its a great unit too. It takes a real beating, I know that fer sure!  Sinker"
282740,blue pickeral,2008-12-22 08:06:00,267,"As everyone seems to be out of stock for snow blowers this year, at least you've got a head start on research for next year! Only thing I have to add to the above, is that all the 'name' brands available at the chain stores, except for Poulin, Ariens and Honda seem to be made by the same manufacturer, which might make it easier to find parts:   http://www.mtdcanada.com/products-snowblowers.asp"
282790,Radnine,2008-12-22 13:49:00,1538,What does OT stand for?
282797,Rattletrap2,2008-12-22 14:08:00,1652,"Radnine, OT = Off topic  I have an Ariens 11.5 h.p. with a 24"" width. Unit is built like a tank, but here in ""the land of the ice and snow"", it was a good investment! It is also the weight of a tank though and is not easy to lug around.  That is discouraging news to see Tecumseh is gone. The SnowKing engine was always a main engine on many, many machines!  I use the snow blower as a back-up to my ATV with a 60"" plow blade. It is also used around the house to clean up close.  I looked at many brands when I bought mine, and almost bought the Murray machine from HD. I tried a buddies Ariens and noticed a huge difference in the quality and construction compared to the others I had looked at including Craftsman. I'm sure I also paid more, but I bought mine from HD in the month of August and saved $400 by buying a leftover floor model. It just happened to be the exact model that I was going to buy from a dealer and the new years models were actually going up in price, so I could not pass up the deal.  I also have an Ariens walk behind grass trimmer that does a great job. I try to purchase most of my stuff from local dealers whenever I can. The HD deal was just too good in the case of the snowblower!"
282823,JohnF,2008-12-22 15:55:00,3494,"Last winter I posted a defence of small blowers (5.5 hp 22"" cut two stage w/no cutter bars) like the one I bought at CTC for $500. I needed one that would fit in my garage when my wife's car was in. I gave my big 30"" 12 hp w/drift cutters to my son for his long driveway.  Now the little one is admittedly kind of a toy but if you treat it gently it's great for small spaces like my drive, until we  get a blast like last night's. Then the lack of power becomes obvious for throwing snow any distance and chugging thru the mess left by the street plow.  Buy the biggest you have space and budget for. If money or space are an issue then don't be afraid of the little units. Just remember that heavy jobs will always be problematic for it, but not impossible. The sheet metal body is kinda twisty so don't be reefing and twisting too much or you'll be stress cracking things. And if you're a helpful soul who does your neighbours' drives too then keep in mind that ground travel speeds are slow. The one forward speed thing is a bit of a nuisance when the snow gets heavy or when it's extremely light. It's nice to be able to match the ground speed to the second stage impeller speed for better clearing.  One of the unexpected bonuses with the small unit is being able to lift it into the back of a van or suv by myself to transport it. I could never have done that with the big monster.  Happy blowing.  JF"
282836,DRIFTER_016,2008-12-22 16:17:00,10439,"When I lived in Grand Valley we had a 10HP 28"" Mastercraft from Canadian Tire. It worked great the whole time we had it. Our driveway was 220' long with a 2 car turn around near the house so it got well used. Don't forget to do your end of season maintenance, you don't want issues in the middle of the season."
