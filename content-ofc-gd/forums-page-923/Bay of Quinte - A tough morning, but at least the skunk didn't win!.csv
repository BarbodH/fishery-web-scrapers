There were lots of eyes there this morning, but boy were they being Scrooge.  After being denied time and time again, we finally put a few on the ice.  If you are looking for perch, there are a ton of them!  After awhile, the walleye activity subsided.  Due to only a few hours of sleep last night, and a bit of a lull, I was sitting in my Fish Trap starting to nod off a bit.  That's when the snot rocket almost ripped the rod out of my hand.  That pike had me going for a minute...  Have a great Christmas!  Jeff  "
