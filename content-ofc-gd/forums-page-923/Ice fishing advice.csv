281254,HTHM,2008-12-18 22:23:00,4082,"I would like to take myself and 5 other family members out ice fishing on Dec 27. Where can I go, and where do I rent a hut? Thanks in advance"
281268,Big Cliff,2008-12-18 22:50:00,6899,"Well, first, don't plan it for down South, Florida ice conditions are very unpredictable! Depending on the people you want to take, consider the catching! Simco can offer some good perch action and there are a lot of hut opperators to choose from. Scugog, can offer some good walleye action but it can be time sensitive, not so good for younger fisherpersons.  I'd be happy to try to help more if I can, give me more information."
281283,richyb,2008-12-18 23:27:00,774,i dont think any hut operators will be on the ice by dec 27th on simcoe. some people are starting to venture out but only on 3 inches of ice in certain spots ... the main lake is still wide open
281288,medmart,2008-12-18 23:37:00,587,Here is a list of hut operators  http://www.fishinontario.com/icefish.shtml#simcoe
281295,johnnyb,2008-12-18 23:52:00,3413,"Dec. 27th could be kind of early if you're not very far north.  The best advice I would give is to either go with someone who goes on the ice regularly, or wait a bit until the hut operators are in full swing."
282670,profisher25,2008-12-22 02:30:00,185,"Try out Simcoe, you may have to bring your own hut, but if its a nice day out,  then there's  no need"
282676,irishfield,2008-12-22 02:40:00,26272,"I'll be on Lake Temagami tomorrow, with my truck, Albert. Not sure if you wanna go that far..but I can see if Temagami Shores has their huts going out yet."
282680,BassAsin,2008-12-22 02:45:00,806,"you know if you do go through wayne i'll be one of the guys runnin the pull out if you have to go through insurance!!!! and it pays nice, feel free to do some donuts or burn outs! HAHAH be safe and hope the weather is good  , it is pretty ugly here at the moment blowing windy snow"
282682,irishfield,2008-12-22 02:48:00,26272,"12 to 14"" of ice Matt. My neighbour took a full truck load of firewood across it yesterday. -36C up there last night! Gotta pick them up so we can all attend another neighbours funeral tomorrow afternoon in Liskeard. I'm hoping it's nice too... we've got about 9 inches of snow here since dark and blowing hard. I'll have a peak at TShores for you Albert."
282715,sonny,2008-12-22 04:06:00,511,"nippising might be a good bet this time of year,,usuallly alot of operators get out early there!"
283123,irishfield,2008-12-23 05:23:00,26272,You can't fish Nip until after Jan 1st!  Albert.. I drove my truck across portage bay on Lake Temagami today. Temagami Shores Resort is using a portable hut to appease guests right now... but suspect they'll be pulling some huts out this week.
283127,HTHM,2008-12-23 05:37:00,4082,Thanks for the help Irish!
283129,BassAsin,2008-12-23 05:41:00,806,"i figured there would be lots of ice there, been pretty nipply here for a long time now, sorry to hear of the resaon for headin north. i would like to assume its all black ice as well?"
283131,irishfield,2008-12-23 05:45:00,26272,Yah... just turn your radio up a bit Matt... that way the wife can't hear the cracking !  It's good ice... very light skim of snow and neighbour also packed  the little snow and has flooded it a couple of times. Also was nice and plowed me a road right to my dock!  It was my neighbour that usually builds the ice road that we had to attend services for... cancer takes another.
283133,BassAsin,2008-12-23 05:50:00,806,"imagine that, whatever happened to old age and ntural death. CANCER has become a household name far too quickly"
283134,BassAsin,2008-12-23 05:50:00,806,"did she ask ""why are you taking your seatbelt off? and say roll up that damn window its cold!"""
283135,danbo,2008-12-23 05:52:00,2646,
283136,irishfield,2008-12-23 05:53:00,26272,No Matt.. she's not new to lake living. Was brought up on the water... coat on.. belongings in pockets...seat belts off.. windows down.. lets go... @ 18KPH !

284260,HTHM,2008-12-27 04:05:00,4082,We were set for Fishmaster's but decided not to due to the weather. There will be a next time!
284262,irishfield,2008-12-27 04:06:00,26272,"For sure... you want it to be nice, so everyone wants to make it a tradition/regular event !"
284264,HTHM,2008-12-27 04:08:00,4082,"I'm thinkin' ""Fishing for Tyler"" would be a good introduction."
284268,irishfield,2008-12-27 04:13:00,26272,"Would be perfect Albert... was my first time ice fishing a few years back, during the fishing for Tyler event. I always thought it was nuts... but I'm hooked and fully outfitted now !"
