283522,rhare,2008-12-24 13:34:00,387,"Well Im up early and for once dont have to go to work. So I thought I would put together a little picture review of my 08' season. It was a busy year fishing for me.   Spent Jan-closer fishing Simcoe. What a great lake. I had way too many double digit days of lakers and whities out on the ice. first day out was jan 5th as you can see not much ice but we did get some whities        Then it was off to Joe until break up. Another great lake some real pigs in there.    It was a great winter and I hated to see it go but nothing better then some spring trout'in to break the blues. perfect spring, late run left lots of fish in the local tribs, and no crowds what a bonus. Still catching steel in june on the Niagara!          Caught a few eyes this spring, we had been doing some night fishing for big girls but only managed one my buddy caught and released the fish but its a nice pic so I'll include it. Also bounced the niagara for my first time for eyes.        Next came the carp fishing, wow did we ever get some pigs this year. it wasnt uncommon to hook 15-20 in a hour or two. my biggest weighted 40lbs what a pig!         I have never been that big of a bass guy but I did get out and do some bass'in this year    picked this guy up bassin one day.     I got back into rigging this year and man am I hooked. I cant wait to get back out in the boat on the big water. didnt get any hugh kings but did get some nice bows. two going 15lbs. took a lot of friends and first timers out everyone had a blast!          made it out to simcoe a couple times and did very well for lakers. fun on light tackle       finished up the year bouncing for browns and steelies got a few nice fish.        well I hope to get out again before the year ends but who knows hope you enjoyed the review  After seeing the pics I cant wait to do it again in 09'   Ryan"

283564,Radnine,2008-12-24 16:18:00,1538,What a great year of fishing. I'm more envious though of the fact that you can cut all your hair off and grow it back in the same year. Nice job. Jim

283615,rob v,2008-12-24 18:39:00,535,"Hey Trout guy - some beautiful fish you got there.  Nicely done.  Quick question for you - From your pictures I see you're running a mercury 115 (optimax ?).   I just bought one last year and haven't done any riggin  yet - I hope to this summer, but I'm trying to figure out whether I'll need a kicker or not.   How did you make out with yours ?  I assume you used a trolling plate or drift sock ?"
283632,Ramble,2008-12-24 20:11:00,713,Nice report. You must be proud of a year like that.  -R-
283633,Whitespinnerbait,2008-12-24 20:19:00,2038,Awesome year to say the least ......   Congrats

283651,jwl,2008-12-24 21:45:00,1056,"cool pics, also great to see the late season steel  on the Lower Niagara, it was a great season for that last year, I fished them well into may, then it was ""trailer season""  lots of nice catches in your pics"
283903,Moosebunk,2008-12-25 20:02:00,3970,A stellar season I'm sure you'll repeat in 09.  Thanks for the report.
283906,MCTFisher9120,2008-12-25 20:17:00,3761,"Great summary man, thats a nice looking gar pike!"
283932,trapshooter,2008-12-25 22:36:00,1234,Excellent year you had there Ryan.  Congrats on some fine multi-species angling.
283935,Rich,2008-12-25 22:47:00,3927,"Great pics, great fish! Thanks for sharing!  Did you not get a pic of the 40lb carp? Would love to see that!"
283937,hammercarp,2008-12-25 22:48:00,964,"Congradulations on some great fish, looks like you had a very good year. Thanks for the post it was fun to see the year go by fish by fish."
283940,rhare,2008-12-25 23:05:00,387,"Thanks everyone      whenever you want to hit the ice give me a shout   The pic doesnt do much for the fish, but its the one with the partial nudity. We put it on the scale and its accurate to a pound. we got 5 over 30lbs that morning."
283974,Rich,2008-12-26 01:48:00,3927,"Ohh I see, you're right that pic doesn't do it justice, though upon closer inspection that is quite the fat fish and a tail the size of my head. Nice catch!"
284404,profisher25,2008-12-27 18:50:00,185,Looks like a great year!
