Without getting into much of it,this time of year makes one wish and hope.We gained and we lost,but life in a whole is well,grand today. Like I said,I asked for nothing,but got much in return. A card from my wife that simply read,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,   To my lover and to my friend. Words that mean so much, at this time of year.  Oh and the cash to buy what ever I want was a nice touch too.  From the misfish family Hope you are having a very Merry Christmas day.

283972,jwl,2008-12-26 01:39:00,1056,"you guys are reminding me of many family dinners around my mom's with a house load of relatives,some of the relatives that would fly in from Newfoundland would bring a bunch of stuff from back home that my step dad couldn't get unless he took a trip to a specialty shop some where.  heck for that matter, when him and my mom got married there was a huge party and campout where my trailer is now..at the time my step uncle and my parents both had trailers side by side we loaded both sites with tents and people and had huge cook outs with tonnes of ""down home"" goodies.  loads of good times, tonnes of laughs, lots of rum!!!  not to be a thread hi-jacker...   just lots of good memories  wish you and yours all the best this holiday season, sounds like you guysare already putting together a great recipe (not just the eats) to make the best of the new year ahead already"
