I drove by some ponds in Guelph the other day and one had a portable hut on it (see map for location).  Anybody have any info on these ponds?  Or any other ponds that hold panfish to keep the kids busy?    Thanks, Burt"

Will be an ice rink on the pond soon if you want to throw their skates in the trunk as well...  Will post when we have it all ready to go, going to flood it soon to smooth things out a bit  Cheers,  Jen at Fishmasters Bait and Tackle in Dunnville"
283851,iceslayer,2008-12-25 16:18:00,97,Any pond you see will be great for the kids.  As long as your allowed!!  Tiny jig's and maggots will pull panfish from a swimming pool if you try hard enough!!  My kids love our ponds around here...   Good Luck and Merry X-Mas   JIm
