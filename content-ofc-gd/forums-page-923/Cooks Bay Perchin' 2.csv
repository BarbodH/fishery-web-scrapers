284230,Skud,2008-12-27 02:32:00,739,"Made it out from 2:30pm until dark with my 8 year old son straight out from Gilford. Fished in 12 fow and up to 20 fow.  The fish were everywhere but mostly in the 15-17 fow range. I kept only 7 keepers(8-9 inches long) and a few that were hooked to deep out of about 100 perch landed. Talked to a guy that was much farther out and said he caught about 45 keepers so the bigger fish are in 25 fow or more.  Shortly after 4pm a daredevil came across from Keswick on his Ski-doo, probably the first of the year. Again we didn't use minnows, just spoons and jigging Raps. Still slushy on top near shore but a solid 5-6 inches of black ice."

284248,profisher25,2008-12-27 03:45:00,185,"Does anyone have any recommendations to lure / bait for perch??? I just normally use either the classic worm, hook, n bobber, and jig n curly tail grub! But are there any other better choices I can try out?  PM me if you can, it would be greatly appreciated!"
