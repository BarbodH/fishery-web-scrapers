283359,Burtess,2008-12-23 23:08:00,901," I have to disagree with this statement.  I have used augers with the inline handles (Swede Bore) and they are more difficult to cut with.  I now use a Finbore III with the offset handles and it cuts ice like butter.  You should not put downward pressure when drilling the hole, all you have to do is turn it and it will grab and cut.  Burt"
283367,crappieperchhunter,2008-12-23 23:36:00,2582,"The important thing is that the blades are curved. The Fin BoreIII and Strikemaster Lazer both have curved blades. I can not stress the importance of this enough. ALL straight blade augers are considerably more work for you then curved blade augers. If you want a good workout get a straight blade auger. If you want something that is less work get a curved blade...it is that simple. Also the smaller the hole, the easier it is. ALOT EASIER!!!!! A 6 inch hole is easy compared to a 8 inch hole.  Now onto the offset handles. Fin Bore III's are offset...Lazers are not. I own both. And I can cut good with both although because you are using slightly different muscles on both I just happen to find the Lazer better for me. However I have friends who just CAN NOT master the offset handles. It's a rhythm thing and for some it is very hard to master. With that in mind I would never recommend the Fin Bore III to anyone who has not at least had a go at using someone else's first.  I cut lotsa holes every winter. So far I can not see myself EVER owning a power auger. Someday maybe, but for now I'm sticking with my manual augers.  Good luck with whatever you go with."
283378,Fisherman,2008-12-24 00:14:00,7201,"So a rough translation would be that you have a couple of uncoordinted bear cubs as friends,     I like the offset ones, shorter arm movement required, and no effort leaning downward."
283403,crappieperchhunter,2008-12-24 01:06:00,2582,My one fishing buddy who has the real problem will be 89 in Feb. I think it is a dexterity/mobility issue. He just finds it easier to lean on the Lazer.  I just prey that I can still go out and ice fish...forget about manually cutting holes...at that age.  I also have a MUCH younger buddy who has trouble...and I have let people use my Fin Bor III on the ice that have had trouble too. I'm just saying some people DO seem to have a hard time with it.  Myself I can go with either. If it helps me catch fish I WILL adapt.
283411,Rizzo,2008-12-24 01:32:00,4754,"ok, here's one for the other team. I used a manual auger for 10 years before switching to gas and all i have to say all these manual auger boosters are INSANE. Gas powered all the way, I will never go back.  I may drill 20 holes a day with the power auger or even more. If the fish aren't there, I'm moving. When I had the manual auger I'd probably stop at 10 (or risk a heart attack)! While I've punched holes and set up lines in minutes, I then break out the hibachi, light it up, wait for the coals, cook up some t-bones, eat 'em  and watch the manual auger guys who are still getting set up. Once set up, many don't want to move because of the work involved.  I can honestly say the gas auger was one of the best fishing purchases I ever made, my only regret was waiting so long to do it."
283441,BassAsin,2008-12-24 02:15:00,806,"i have one of each, personal opinionn i suppose"
283674,Northhunter,2008-12-24 23:21:00,214,"A Finn-bore will cut ice like butter with little to no downward pressure. I've had 30 hole days in March with mine, and that ain't southern Ontario ice! The double offset handles are key - you can strain the muscles in one arm ala the swede-bore or you can use both plus some of your upper body with something like the finn. I shake my head when people talk about using 2 guys to cut holes.  Get the 6"" unless you really need the 8, as an 8"" is cutting almost twice as much ice with every rotation."
283777,Spiel,2008-12-25 12:11:00,9065,"....Hand augers do work well if you have a good one. For me that means sharp, sharp blades and it must have offset handles! Two arms turning with little downward pressure makes an easy day on the ice."
283796,Sinker,2008-12-25 13:18:00,8692,"I'm one of those guys who can't seem to get the rythm of an offset handle. I've been using a swede bore 8"" hand auger for so long, the offset handles mess me up. I can pound holes pretty good with the ole swede bore though......no probs. I've even take a few $'s betting the fin bore could beat me on the swede bore  I know for sure with a hand auger I can drill one hole faster than a gas auger........its when you get into multiple holes that the gas wins hands down. The hand auger is always my first choice though......I find being mobile is key on the ice.........less gear=less set up time!  Its all what your used to.......they all work well, just keep em sharp and don't bang them around.  Sinker"
283888,Rich,2008-12-25 19:22:00,3927,"Hand augers work just fine provided the blades are nice and sharp each season. Unless you're drilling 5,000,000 holes or through 4 feet of ice a hand auger has worked fine for me for the last couple of years. I don't even desire owning a power auger. However I bought an 8"" auger and wish I had bought the 6"". I've fit up to a 12lb brown through the 6 inch hole before and 42 inch pike so I don't think the 8"" is necessary for what I do."
283896,crappieperchhunter,2008-12-25 19:45:00,2582,  Got a 10-12lb muskie out of a 6 inch hole on Scugog a few winters back. No problem fitting it through...but I had a hard time getting it turned to face up the hole and an even harder time figuring out just how to get ahold of it to hoist it out   as all I could see coming up the hole was a mouth full of teeth.  So far I have not caught a fish on the ice that would not come through a 6 inch hole....but I'm still hoping
283898,Sinker,2008-12-25 19:52:00,8692,"This one time.....on simcoe....fishing perch thru an old 4"" hole that I broke open with my boot.....I hooked into what I figured was a pike......on 4lb test.....  Turned out to be a 7lb laker........he filled the 4"" hole pretty good!!!  Getting them to the hole is easy, anyone can do that......getting them turned up the hole is the tricky part!!! Take it easy, and anything will come up!!  Sinker"
283930,drwxr,2008-12-25 22:28:00,453,"hmmm, these posts got me wondering should i return the 2 weeks ago bought new bore III 8"" incher and get myself a 6""."
283975,crappieperchhunter,2008-12-26 01:53:00,2582,I used to have an 8 inch hand auger....but never used it....cause it is a TON more work cutting an 8 inch hole. Now that I'm starting to fish whities and lakers a little bit...I wish I had never got rid of it. Hang onto the 8...you already have it. Just put the 6 inch on your Christmas list for another year. Someday you will be glad you did.
284296,waterwolf,2008-12-27 06:11:00,556,"just bought a power auger but will prefer to use my finbore 8in. on light duty days . new blades , she cuts very well,, the off -set  handles work for me 'cause i can use opposite muscle momentum to get the job done .cutting 7-8in. of ice ,, i can usually cut 3-4  holes before stopping for a break[beer]. it's early though"
283144,profisher25,2008-12-23 06:27:00,185,"Ok, so there's a HUGE difference in a motor powered auger, but, for someone like me who doesn't do much ice fishing, is it worth buying one. I personally say no... however, I noticed a cheaper cousin of the gas powered auger.. the hand auger! I was wondering if a hand powered auger worked as efficiently as a motor powered auger. Time consumption isn't really my problem, I just want an auger that doesn't cost lots of money, which could be spent on more important fishing equipment!  Any help would be greatly appreciated!"
283145,BassAsin,2008-12-23 06:30:00,806,"its not the cousin but the father and the chisle and axe are the great grandfathers i have two and can cut through 3 feet of ice in just over 30 seconds with the 6"" and about 45 seconds with the 8 inch"
283149,profisher25,2008-12-23 06:38:00,185,"  Ok, so, in your opinion, which one is better?? 6"" or 8""? I guess its really a matter of personal preference right? I might go for the 8"" though."
283150,BassAsin,2008-12-23 06:39:00,806,all depends on how big of fish you plan to catch i used to use a 6 inches and drill a triangle of holes and chisle out the center when i fished the north channle for big F3 splake
283152,profisher25,2008-12-23 06:45:00,185," Alrghty then, you were a realy help to me!  I think I might end up getting the 8""... im kinda hoping to land that ""big one""  Thanks BassAsin!"
283153,BassAsin,2008-12-23 06:54:00,806,"8 times pie is a little over 24 inches which is a good girth on a fish the 43 inch pike i caught was ""snug"" comin up the 8"" hole but for the most part its more than big enough and the hand augers work well if you treat them well just makes sure they dont have an ""offset"" handle thats when the top handle grip is not in line with the bottom handle it  makes for difficult drilling and can be very frustrating"
283154,richyb,2008-12-23 07:14:00,774,"If you dont plan on cutting many holes the hand auger is the way to go ... ...  I have seen lots of lakers in the 15-20 pound mark come through an 8 inch auger hole . as long as the head can come through, the body will follow with a nice big SLURP !   Hey bassasin you must be a machine or else my new power auger blows because i think it would take longer than 45 seconds to go through 3 feet of ice .."
283155,BassAsin,2008-12-23 07:20:00,806,"sharp blades shimms and one deep breath! we've timed it witht the 6 "" before 36 turns and just shy of 36 inches in just over 30 seconds been doin it since i was 12   and when i fish for specks i make swiss cheese of the ice no matter how much ice there is until i find the fish"
283200,johnnyb,2008-12-23 14:39:00,3413,"I agree...hand auger is no problemo...fishing on 3 feet of ice makes it a bit daunting to be popping a LOT of holes...but with enough breaks and fish in between, the heart rate comes back down, and it's not a big deal"
283214,Zib,2008-12-23 15:31:00,369," A 6"" auger will be all you really need unless you plan on catching 25 Lb pike & 30 Lb lake trout. I had a 8"" hand auger before & I exchangfed it for a 6"". It's a lot more work to cut with the 8"" than the 6"" & your blades will last longer.  I have a Strikemaster Lazer 6"" & it cuts through the ice like it's going through butter."
283232,Mike Pike,2008-12-23 16:11:00,1332,"For years, I'd pack my 8-inch auger when heading up to Lake Simcoe for perch.  But as the icefishing season draws on and the ice gets thicker, man, did my back ever start to complain.  lol  Now, with a 6-inch auger, I move around more and drill more holes cuz it's waaaaay easier.  If I was fishing in laker and whitefish water, ya I'd want an 8-inch, but 6-inch is just fine for perch.  Just be carefull when you get 'em close to the hole though.  I slow down my retrieve a bit so I can make sure the fish doesn't head away from the hole cuz the lure hooks can catch onto the edge of the ice hole on the way up.  I loose more perch that way!"
283237,ciceri,2008-12-23 16:18:00,535,"by the time your buddy has his gas one running good enough to cut a hole, you will have already punched 3 holes to fish."
283238,Greencoachdog,2008-12-23 16:18:00,8163,Hand augers are good tools and good exercise!!!
283239,danc,2008-12-23 16:20:00,4677,"My ice fishing days are pretty much over I think, but I've always used a hand auger in my day. As you can imagine, the ice gets pretty thick here in an average winter. I don't know if they still make them, but I had a 7"" auger. As others have said, a minute or two and you're through. We'd often use the two man method which involves a guy on each side of the auger. It's easier when you're pulling the offset handle towards you rather than pushing it away for you. So with two guys, one of them is always pulling. Take care of your blades. Oil them each time you use them. Touch them up with a whetstone occasionally. My best advice would be to carry some light gauge sheet metal shims and an allen wrench so that you can change the blade cutting angle slightly out in the field. This has saved the day many times."
283257,richyb,2008-12-23 17:53:00,774,Heres my attempt   
283259,BassAsin,2008-12-23 17:58:00,806,hope ya plan on puttin new blades on thing after that! HAHAHA  A+ for effort!
283260,DRIFTER_016,2008-12-23 18:03:00,10439," That's funny right thar!!!!!   If you don't have an auger but have a chain saw, they work great!!!!"

283287,rob v,2008-12-23 19:15:00,535,"Do not buy the auger they're using in that video.  Buy a decent auger (lazer, fin-bore - less than $100), don't bang it around (take care of the blades) and if you're fishing for anything less than big pike/walleye etc a 6 inch hole is plenty.  But if you plan on cutting through 3 feet of ice regularly you might want to beef up the biceps !"
283302,fisher,2008-12-23 20:07:00,451,And watch those blades - they are sharp!  I learned the hard way when I barely touched one and immediately began to bleed - very deep cut.  Now I always have the guard on when not in use and always keep it away from children.

Now I stick with my 6"" lazer and 8"" jiffy for later in the year or if I am going to be moving around alot some will look at me funny when I walk onto the river with it and there is only 1' of ice but when you are pulling big eyes through the ice and might have to move alot it sure does make it easier on ya."
