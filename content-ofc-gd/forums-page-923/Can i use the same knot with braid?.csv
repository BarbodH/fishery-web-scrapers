284063,MCTFisher9120,2008-12-26 16:32:00,3761,I loved using the palomar knot with mono but can i still use it with braid line(20lb)? If not can somebody lead me to a good video of another knot to use....i hope palomar works still
284066,Ramble,2008-12-26 16:35:00,713,Palomer works great with braided.  -R-
284067,salmon,2008-12-26 16:36:00,334,http://www.animatedknots.com/indexfishing....imatedknots.com  For tying a leader line? Uni to Uni to connect two lines together  If it is power pro line use the inst. included. Jose

284089,fishboy,2008-12-26 17:48:00,550,palomar for direct tying

284201,camillj,2008-12-27 01:24:00,1988,Just keep that in mind next time you are snagged ... it will save you a rod tip or maybe a nasty line cut .... I hate the stuff ... although I do use it for the BIG toothy girls
284208,Whitespinnerbait,2008-12-27 01:33:00,2038," I keep a small pair of those rapala scissors ,for cutting braided line"
284329,forrest,2008-12-27 14:18:00,1032, What happened when you tried to use the pocket knife?  Palomar is what I use.  The braided lines manufacturer website will have knots to use.  Mono is a lot different from braid a lot of knots will slip with braid.  forrest
284332,MCTFisher9120,2008-12-27 14:30:00,3761," I cut the line lol, i had a older pair of Mustad line clippers that did not cut the braid...i have a new never used pocket knife that cut it with no problem...i'll be looking at bass pro tomorrow for come braid clippers/sissors."
