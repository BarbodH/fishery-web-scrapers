Lots of phone calls with family and friends and some nice background Christmas music. We would have rather been with our kids but.... well, we all know what the weather was like yesterday, if it isn't burried in snow, it is covered in ice.  Wishing each and everyone of you a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year!"
