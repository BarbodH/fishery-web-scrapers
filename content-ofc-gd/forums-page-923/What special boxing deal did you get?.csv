284283,tschirk,2008-12-27 05:07:00,261,Very disappointed in BPS...I wanted the Clam @ 189... all gone and all I got was attitude from staff. Definitely not the same experience as the US. BTW: Their March Spring Fishing Spectacular is the better deal. I think I'll spend my money with a local business that appreciates it....  Ted
284284,waterwolf,2008-12-27 05:11:00,556,"got to BPS at 9:30 , just in time for the 2nd skid of strikemasters to hit the floor[ i was told they were gone] . my first power auger. let the laziness begin,, oh yeah.   the only reason i would treat myself to this is because i received enough gift certy's to get it and a couple of goodies for free . getting the truck off of sacred ground is when the beast reared its ugly head ,, man that was a test. that parking lot got nasty . point me in the direction of ice ,, any ice . sat's forecast,,, plus what?? plus 12 degrees.     go figure."
284285,danc,2008-12-27 05:15:00,4677,"I never go to the boxing day sales either. Until today. I saw an Olympus DSLR in a flyer on sale today at Future Shop. Miniumum 8 per store and 600 nation wide available, so they said. There's no way that I was going to get up at 5 or 6 am to stand in line for anything. So I didn't. This afternoon I started looking at reviews for the camera. Turns out that the reviews were really great on this camera on several different review sites. So I started to get the itch. I checked Future Shops web site and it said that there were 291 left nation wide. It didn't say if there were any left locally though. And they don't answer the phone on boxing day. So I decided to jump in the shower and head down there. Half an hour later I was ready to head out when I checked the web site again. 239 left. They had sold 50 more of these cameras in half an hour. So at about 3 pm, away I went. The store wasn't overly busy by then. I walked up to the camera dept. and called Jim, whom I know personally,  over. They had a few left. Phew!!! I was in and out of the store in 15 minutes. The camera is an Olympus Evolt E-410. It comes with a 14-42mm lens and a 40-150mm lens. A fantastic buy for only $379.00. Now all I have to do is learn how to use the darn thing."
284286,GBW,2008-12-27 05:28:00,8460,Is there any SIMS gear left @ bps?
284287,okumasheffield,2008-12-27 05:34:00,318,"The other buddy of mine who got up late and was lucky enough to get his Simms L2 in LL at 6:30pm and he said there were still half shelf left ... not sure about the size.  GBW, I guess you could try your luck to see if they can match the price for you tomorrow when you go. As far as I know, no other Simms products were on boxing day sale"
284305,KelfuN,2008-12-27 07:26:00,246,my fishing buddies picked up the L2 today for me while i was stuck at work from 5am-4pm.  i agree with the bad attitude with BPS staff...ESPECIALLY the guys in the flyshop
284306,MuskyBill,2008-12-27 08:00:00,311,"DanC getting a new camera is like ALL of us getting a gift!  Congrats Dan. Reading your reply was giving ME the itch as well, sounds exciting..."
284335,danbo,2008-12-27 14:45:00,2646,Scores! DanC
284349,bbog,2008-12-27 15:49:00,665,You are going to love this camera once you get over the learning curve. The absolute best kit lenses around. Can't wait to see some of your future posts!
284376,SlowPoke,2008-12-27 17:23:00,2984,I tried that once at a fire extinguisher sale... d'oh!
284381,Rustic-Fisher,2008-12-27 17:39:00,826,  Thank god for fire and EMS
284057,okumasheffield,2008-12-26 15:47:00,318,"One buddy and I got to Basspro @ 7:00am today and we were the 6th and 7th person in the line-up under the impression there wont be crowds @ BPS  Well, we were so wrong that there were hundreds of people lining up by 7:40am!  As soon as the door opened, we went straight to Flyshop to pick up three Simms L2s for $150/each ($299 original) (we have already tried the fit and size before 24th). The clerk at the flyshop counter was joking about us being crazy until this guy came over to pick up 5 of them without hestitations ... WOW, and he asked the clerk to carry another 5 for him to check-out ... Guess he bought them for all his friends or he is in for serious businese!  People we have talked to while lining up mostly went for huntings stuff  wonder what other boxing day deals you guys have picked up?"
284058,Handlebarz,2008-12-26 15:58:00,3790,We usually hit the stores but today we did not go out today well unless ya call a box of Tim bits going out.  I have been shopping on line for a flasher or other unit like the huminbird 383c portable or who knows what all I know is I have been driving myself nuts with all this looking time to buy now
284060,Mattones,2008-12-26 16:22:00,587,"I was at Bass pro at around 8:40ish. I must say most 'deals' they had were not really deals. Mind you I went into the hunting area. Was going to buy Snow camo but passed on it. As soon as i put down the Excalibur Phoenix it was gone. Had $150 gift card I was going to use for it.  Walked out with nothing. I was shocked. The drive home it was like a blizzard, Saw 3 cars in the ditch.  Before we left for BPS The girlfriend and I went to Wal-mart. and I walked out with nothing. The Blu-Ray selection stunk.  So far nothing in my favour"
284062,MCTFisher9120,2008-12-26 16:26:00,3761,"There was no deal here but here is what i got, http://www.ofncommunity.com/forums/index.p...c=26823&hl="
284068,brifishrgy,2008-12-26 16:42:00,559,Decided to go to Bronte Outdoors this morning instead of Bass Pro .. picked up 4 reels .. great deal .. plus no tax  
284069,medmart,2008-12-26 16:53:00,587,I went to bass pro got there about 9am and picked up the lazer mag gas auger got out of there at 10:30 due to the fact that not all the tills where open even ran into Fishindevel  Rob
284073,tdotfisherman,2008-12-26 17:06:00,317,"Even though I got 150 dollars worth of BPS gift cards I didn't bother going today.. their deals were weak, and I'm in no rush to buy the few things that I need.."
284077,lunkerbasshunter,2008-12-26 17:24:00,2585,"    Sweet, i may have to wonder over there today to pick one of these up!  Cheers!"
284080,irishfield,2008-12-26 17:28:00,26272,I got to do what you're supposed to do on Boxing Day.... slept in 'till 11am ! lol
284084,misfish,2008-12-26 17:39:00,29133," I got to go to work,then head home to make another boiled dinner for the parents and sis,s family. Thats enough salt intake for me for the next 6 months.LOL  Hey Bro,nice score."
284086,solopaddler,2008-12-26 17:44:00,8605, Lucky you. That was my plan 'till the kids jumped on top of me at 7am.  I wouldn't be shopping today even if they were giving stuff away LOL! (Going sledding with the younguns later  )
284090,bigugli,2008-12-26 17:53:00,6138,"The family is out digging elbows at the mall while I prepare another Christmas feast for this evening. I've got more fishing stuff than I can use, or carry, already.  This evening's menu includes the following, but not exclusively:  Turkey and fixins, whipped potato, turnip casserole, sweet potato casserole, glazed carrots, corn, fresh baked rolls, and trifle for dessert.  All washed down with 4 different local Niagara wines."
284091,danbo,2008-12-26 17:55:00,2646,I got a  Humminbird Piranha Max 220 + battery & charger  total was $137 at LeBarons..  http://store.humminbird.com/humminbird-pro...od406870-1.html
284099,bassjnkie,2008-12-26 18:28:00,1101,"I have a 2 page list, kinda like a gift to me, but nothing I want from Bass Pro is on sale. So, this morning I woke up at 10am, went to get gas at 66cent, looked over at the Bass Pro parking Lot, and said ""HELL NO!!!"". I hate boxing day around here, with the mall and all.  Happy Holiday's  Daniel"
284112,BUSTER,2008-12-26 19:41:00,1336,no stores open in sudbury   my parents say its the by-law....my wife is not happy!
284114,purekgw,2008-12-26 19:45:00,585,easy way to get people away from what you want is to yell FIRE! gets me all the best deals
284119,Bondar,2008-12-26 20:44:00,817,I hit lebaron everything is no tax plus they still honour your 10% membership card grabbed a tackle bag new bolle polerized shades. I went for wading boots but no luck ! Bought a bunch of small tackle as well
284122,Mattones,2008-12-26 20:53:00,587,Went to Best buy about an hour ago. Traffic down town was horrid. Lucky I parked at Famous Players and walked it. Picked up 5 Blu Ray titles.
284123,Bernie66,2008-12-26 21:06:00,123,"The Simms wader is a good deal at BP for $150.  I got home, searched online and they are going for around $250US on average.  For those of you that froze your a$$ waiting outside for the store to open,  next time wait at their mall entrance where it is nice and warm.  They actually opened the mall entrance before they opened their front entrance today."
284199,fishing n autograph,2008-12-27 01:23:00,2540,I got a pretty good tripod for $45......  and just my 2 cents.....Vaughan Mills Mall is the biggest pain in the ass in the world....doing calls in there today was like pushing your way through a japanese bullet train during rush hour. The worst part is that It took me 15 minutes with lights and sirens on to get out of the parking lot to get to a dying baby.... sad and people were calling us complaining that their tax dollars aren't being used properly because they can't get out of a parking lot fast enough....
284211,Mattones,2008-12-27 01:38:00,587, Mind if i ask what you do?lol
284212,fishing n autograph,2008-12-27 01:43:00,2540," Well, at work I wear a lot of hats......waste management...public relations....stunt driver.....lol....depends on the day"
284213,Weeds,2008-12-27 01:43:00,782,"Scored myself a brand new St. Croix 7 foot medium light for 70 bucks, no tax. Good luck finding a retailer that can beat the OFC classifieds, boxing day or any other! No line up either. Considered hitting Bass pro for all of a half second for a reel before deciding to wait; after all, Spring is a good 3 monthes off and I also found Basspro's specials a bit lacking. Anyone know when they have their trade a reel in day kind of thing?"
284242,okumasheffield,2008-12-27 03:06:00,318,"There were no good fishing stuff deals other than the L2 Simms.  Decided to stick around after holding tight onto my purchase and could not find anything else to spend money on.  The entrance to Vaughan Mills Mall is definitely a much more comfortable place for lining up .. However, my buddy told me it is further away from the flyshop .. based on his estimation .. haha  Lets see if Simms wading boots will ever be on sale ..."
284274,Joey,2008-12-27 04:33:00,9122,"I slept in til 11:00 and then hit Danier Leather and picked up two jackets, one for $99 and one for $79, down from $349.00 each  Very nice jackets too.  The place was a zoo, but it was worth it.  Joey"
