284050,tschirk,2008-12-26 15:24:00,261,Works great. Portable- heats & cooks. By a refillable 2-5lbs propane tank & adapter hose ...the 1lbs cans are useless...
284076,irishfield,2008-12-26 17:18:00,26272,Or skip the expensive adapter hose and just buy the one that screws into a normal tank.
284082,Fisherman,2008-12-26 17:35:00,7201,"Definitely a good heater/cooker, I made a small metal stand with a couple of J bolts and wingnuts to widen the base area when the soup pot or frying pan was on top.  Worst thing I did was give it away when I sold the hut."
