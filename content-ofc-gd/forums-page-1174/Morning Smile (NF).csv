So Satan walked up to the old man and said ""Don't you know who I am?"" ""Yep, sure do."" ""Aren't you afraid of me."" ""Nope, sure ain't."" ""Don't you realize I can kill you with a word?"" ""Don't doubt it for a minute."" ""Did you know that I could cause you physical agony for all eternity?"" ""Yep"", was the calm reply. ""And you still are not afraid?"" asked Satan. ""Nope."" More that a little perturbed, Satan asked,""Well, why aren't you afraid of me?"" The man calmly replied............ ""Been married to your sister for 68 years!!"""
