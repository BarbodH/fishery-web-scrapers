Is it a simple laker/bass lake? any other species? I have a boat on a trailer and wouldn't look past fishing other lakes in the region if anyone could recommend anything.  Thanks guys and gals,"
97839,Nemo,2007-07-25 15:18:00,727,"Bass and more importantly Lakers. Last time I was there diddn't have much time to fish it but there were lot's of folks downrigging for Trout around the island in the centre. Basically the whole west end of the Lake is up for sale but there are few cottages on it.  There is also a lift over/boat railway to Red Pine Lake you may want to check out. Depends how big your boat is. I would call the guys at the marina on Kennisis and they can let you know more.  Bottom line I would bring a depth finder, dowwnrigger and my Bass and Trout setups.  You may also want to check out the Cottagers association website. http://www.klcoa.org  Here's a map http://www.klcoa.org/lakeplan/KennisisLakeWatershed.pdf"
97841,ilario,2007-07-25 15:20:00,166,"it's been cool enough nthat you might not need a rigger... it's a deep, cold lake.. decent SM but I think lakers aren;t that easy to come by...  we rented there years ago...nice lake  good luck"
97842,Nemo,2007-07-25 15:21:00,727,Oh yes and this depth map and navigation hazard map will be useful for the first timer.  http://www.klcoa.org/lakeplan/KennisisLake...onalHazards.pdf  Good luck and let me know how you do. Last time I went we pulled out on one of the islands for a swim and luch. There were blueberries growing there as well mmm.
97883,ilario,2007-07-25 17:17:00,166,  nice map...where diod you get that? I'd like to lookup some other lakes
