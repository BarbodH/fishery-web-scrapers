98256,OhioFisherman,2007-07-26 21:04:00,6623,"Do you have rods, reels, and line that will handle one, don`t forget leaders also. Better not to hook one and hurt it than lose it with a lure stuck in it`s mouth because your gear wasn`t up to snuff. I lost quite a few on the wrong gear, try to do it right, it saves you some grief."
98314,Rizzo,2007-07-27 01:17:00,4754,"I'm with ohiofisherman.  Musky fishing is a heck of a lot more than chucking bucktails on a medium action spinning rod with 20 lb test.  Although this may hook you a fish, and even a big one, said fish will probably not survive (if you're even able to land it), especially in the warm water months. Go to a fishing store with dad's credit card and get someone knowledgeable to outfit you with proper rod, reel, line, leaders, terminal tackle, big-arse net, big mouth spreader, long nose pliers, bolt cutters etc etc.  May cost you (read dad) a few hundred bucks but worth it.  To me, its a sickening feeling to catch a beauty fish and then doubt whether it will survive the release, especially if the fish could have been brought in/released sooner had proper equipment been used.  When you're ready for the fish of a lifetime, then go for it because the big'uns are definitely in Nipissing.  If you're not ready, you may end up with a big stinky dead musky in the bottom of your boat...but before he breaths his last, he'll thrash around (probably stick a few trebles in you first!) and trash everything in your boat."
