98215,Tinbad,2007-07-26 18:40:00,1,"I recently found out that my secure storage facility is no longer in the outdoor storage business, so I have to find a new place for my 18' boat ... and my 16' tent trailer ... fast. I really want to find something for the boat that is nearby so I can drop it off or retrieve it at will. Indoor or outdoor, but needs to be relatively secure. My last boat was stolen while in a ""secure"" storage facility, so the insurance company wants this one to be at least in a locked compound, or a private residence.  I live in northeast Oakville, so would prefer something in Oakville or western Mississauga. If I have to I will store the boat and camper in separate facilities, or sharing a single larger storage space.  I have already looked at a few places through Yellow Pages and Google, but haven't found much. I did find one that is $100 each unit per month ($2400/yr), which is way over the budget.  Anybody have any good ideas?  Thanks Tinbad"
