I basicaslly know Georgina Island is ok for Smallies. Which side though? East, west, north, south? I am hoping to catch a few smallies. Will be there for a week. Anyone know simcoe and want to come up and fish with me let me know in advance."

98038,Rizzo,2007-07-26 01:13:00,4754,I don't know simcoe (ignore the fact I live 5 minutes from it) but I understand smallies can be found at Thorah island.  Can your boat get you there?

I will be at Camp #48 if I am not mistaken. Rocelu. Drop by the evening before you wanna go fishin because I will most likely be out on the water during the day, weather permitting.  Thanks for the link darcy. Much appreciated."
