97940,taper,2007-07-25 19:35:00,611,"4 friends from work and myself had booked a charter before Christmas last year and the time finally rolled around and the wait was well worth it. The weather was fantastic, hardly a ripple on the water. The fish were co-operating and it was a great time being with just the guys. The fish were stacked up in small pockets, we could troll for 20-30 minutes and not a bite then bang multiple rods would let loose. We ran riggers, Dypsies, lead core and jet divers behind the planer boards. Here is a shot of one time we had 4 fish on at the same time and boated 3 of the 4, I can live with that kind of odds. We had one trouble during the day and that was with a very large floating weed bed that snuck up on us while we were landing fish.  This is one of my favorite photos from the day, my friend managed to catch this guy in the air.  In the end a great day was had by all and we are already trying to decide on a date for next year, which should be even better. Trophy Taker the charter we went out with is putting a second boat on and we want to go ten guys with each chipping in 5 or 10 bucks for a biggest fish of the day competition. Also we noticed back at the dock we were one fish over our limit ( someone forgot to hit the clicker) so we donated it to our captain for dinner. Next year we will have to keep a closer eye. "
