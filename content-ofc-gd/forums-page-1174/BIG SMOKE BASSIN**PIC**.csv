Well the swimbait bait bite I've been working on is starting to happen.  Focusing on sunken timber areas, we caught some NICE bass real fast.  I have a return engagement on a REALLY BIG GIRL that I found tonite lurking on a deep point-this fish is as hefty as they get in Ontario. Ready to shot some video if it happens.  Thanks to my wife Janice for great camera work today and all she does in the boat to keep up with me. She lost a monster on a branch today so I feel bad for her.   "
