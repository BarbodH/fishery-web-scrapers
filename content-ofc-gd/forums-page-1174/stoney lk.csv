98252,dow33,2007-07-26 20:55:00,27,Just got back from the cottage with the boys from my office 4 days of fishing and playing cards. We only caught 4 eyes in total and the bigest was maybe 3 pounds. I have been on the lk for ten yrs and it is getting worse and worse or is it that i have lost my touch. Has anyone out here been on stoney latly and how did you do!!
