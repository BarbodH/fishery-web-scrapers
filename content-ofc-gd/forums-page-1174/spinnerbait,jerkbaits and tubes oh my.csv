Head to my favorite hole and they were everywhere there.It was like looking in aqurium.Very cool.  Today every bait I threw,caught fish.  Im just going to leave you with pics.Action was fast and furious this morning.                         2morrow is the wifes day so no fishing."

97880,kennyman,2007-07-25 17:07:00,737,Every bit you threw worked. That'd be nice. Is that a white goby bait you were using? Lunkerhunt? How did you rig it? Thanks.
97882,Fishnfiend,2007-07-25 17:15:00,357,Very nice Brian.  The white tubes work for smallies as well as lakers?
97951,misfish,2007-07-25 20:01:00,29133,The white lure you see is a 2002 megabass. I bought it last year off of ebay.19 bucks plus shipping.It was used as well.  I try to only use it where I know there are no stealing toothy critters.
