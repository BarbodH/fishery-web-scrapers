For 1-1/2hr no fish caught, not even bites   This morning, went there again ~6am. For the first 2 hrs or so, saw probably ~20-30 fish jumps/splashes. I kept casting as close as those splashes were... with mostly senko weightless, but also tried topwater, jig, grub. Got nothing at all, not even decent bites   The fish just didn't like me I guess. Talk about something not building confidence huh Finally at around the 3hr mark, got 1 SMB at ~13"" and that's about it & 1/2 hr later or so called it a day.  So 6 hrs for 1 fish arh"
98334,007,2007-07-27 02:54:00,537,There's one thing to be positive about - you saw the fish jumping - so at least they are there.  With some persistance you'll get them.  Try putting away the lures and try a good old fashioned float fished worm or minnow - you'll get them!  Good luck and look forward to a report with pics of your catch!  007
98339,oncogene,2007-07-27 03:00:00,154,"yeah may go back to the old live worm once awhile. The last couple months I deliberately not bring live worm with me for fishing so I can force myself to use the lures more. Well and also don't have to deal with the herds of sunfish that usually pick on the live worms.  Wish the topwater bait would work tho, esp with all the jumps... still havne't gotten a fish with the topwater"
98350,007,2007-07-27 03:31:00,537,It's the same story with me - no topwater fish yet.  I generally get frustrated with the lures and go back to the worms.  Perhaps too quickly - perhaps I should do like you and just leave the worms at home and try with all the lures I buy and never seem to use!!!  Good luck
98352,drwxr,2007-07-27 03:52:00,453,"rule of thumb fish that don't bite day, bite at night, night fishing can be so much fun , just have to know the shore well."
98354,oncogene,2007-07-27 04:05:00,154,"^hum never really try night fishing... actually more like I can't try. I'm such a mosquito magnet, once the sun is mostly down I'll get swarmed by them even with bug spray all over me.   But anyway does night fishing for bass means at evening, after dark or like midnight? And what lures good for night?"
