98197,MuskieWannabe,2007-07-26 17:39:00,79,"Thanks everyone for the welcome.  I've followed the site for some time now and now that I finally have my own boat and hitting the water more than ever.  I fish mainly muskies but try out everything else as well.  It's been an up and down year thus far, I've landed one a few muskies myself this year, but have seen and lost quite a few more!  Quick note, that pickerel pictured above was 26"" and was caught at 1pm trolling a 6 1/2"" crankbait at 5.3MPH.  I doubt the walleye guys will believe me but it the truth, 20 FOW!  She hit liek a frieght train...we all thought she was a ski until her slowly rose up from beneath the boat!  Cheers to all!"
98235,TJQ,2007-07-26 19:36:00,7806, Sounds like my first date with Monique.........
98239,rickster,2007-07-26 19:51:00,495,Welcome to the board.  Nice pics I believe you about the walleye.  I troll cranks for walleye alot on one of the lakes here although mostly in the evening and into the night and when they hit they really smack it.   Usuall long line troll big cranks as it gets dark and the walleye are up chasing ciscoes . Here is the pic of one my brother in law got with me a couple weeks ago
