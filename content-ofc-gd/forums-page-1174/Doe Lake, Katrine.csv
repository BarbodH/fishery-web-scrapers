Nothing packed, totally unprepared, but we're gonna go,  leaving tomorrow at 4am. (I love spur of the moment trips  ). Anyhow, my bro in law and his family have been spending there vacation on Doe for the last 8 years. They fish, but not really seriously. He's seen, but never caught a walleye in all those trips. So I tell him on the phone, no problem we'll fill the boat with them when I get there! Has anyone here ever fished walleye in Doe and can point me in the right direction? If we don't get any walleyes he'll never let me live it down  ."
