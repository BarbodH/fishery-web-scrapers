98211,fishboy,2007-07-26 18:31:00,550,I believe the lake that Haliburton is on is called Head Lake but I've never fished it.

98261,Lostchild,2007-07-26 21:17:00,153,"Head Lake is right in the town of Haliburton. It has bass and muskie, both can be caught about 20ft off shore almost anywhere around the perimeter of the lake. The town docks early/late evening can be awesome, throw out a shallow running perch pattern crank and see what happens.  Can't help with Wasaga though."
98358,Musky or Specks,2007-07-27 04:22:00,2710,Head Lake is probably the best lake to catch your first Musky on. Its very small just fish the shoreline and it will produce fish.Heres a photo of my son with his first head lake Musky caught all by himself at 9 yrs
