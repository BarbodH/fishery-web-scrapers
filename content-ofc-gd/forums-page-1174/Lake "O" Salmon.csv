97994,ilario,2007-07-25 22:56:00,166,"why would it be earlier? the run, as in almost every year, begins in Sept, peaks in Oct and trickles in Nov  the odd chinny enters into streams in aug  GB chinnies are ealier - late July to Sept   the salmon are actually behind this year... it was -5 in april and it's been very cool this month...may actually be a bit later!"
