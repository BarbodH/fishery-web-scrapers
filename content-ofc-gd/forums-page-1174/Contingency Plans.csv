98134,Headhunter,2007-07-26 14:32:00,5703,"I'm off to Erie this weekend, booked into a spot in Pt. Colborne, with pickeral being the target for three days! As we all know, Erie can blow up pretty fast and make a three day trip into a one or two days on the water trip. As I am not very familiar with the area, I was wondering if any of you might have some recommendations for alternatives, should Erie be too rough. We'll be in a 20 ft Tracker Targa, 225 ponies and fully rigged for Lead Core, Dipsey's, boards and riggers. We also wouldn't have a problem fishin bass or perch for that matter, should we run into waves over 5 ft on Erie. Don't want any honey holes, just suggestions. Willing to put a few km's on the truck to get to fishable waters. Thanks in advance... HH"
