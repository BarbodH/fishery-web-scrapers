We are looking into going again in the last week of August, and I was wondering if any of you knew campgrounds with river systems that the salmon/steelhead run goes through.  I am hoping to catch just the beginning of the run in the last week of August, even if I dont chances are there will be a few fish that come up early.  If anyone had any recommendations, please post or PM.  Thanks,  Mike"
