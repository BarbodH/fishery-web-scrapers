98009,Rizzo,2007-07-25 23:55:00,4754,"Hello all, hoping to get the boat wet for the whopping third time this season and I'm thinking of trying uncharted waters (for me at least).  I'm thinking of fishing Young Lake (not too far from Norland or Head Lake) this Saturday.  I've fished Head Lake a few times, but when I drive home I'm pretty sure I pass a place called ""Split Rail"" campground  that is supposedly on Young Lake.  When I google it, or even do a search on this site, I can't find squat about Young Lake or this Split Rail place.  Can anyone tell me anything about Young Lake (species of fish to expect, weedy ? lots of numbers but little size etc) or anything about Split Rail (ie can I launch my boat there).  Any info would be greatly appreciated."
98074,ehg,2007-07-26 04:10:00,2666,"Was wondering about that place myself. Apparently small lake with smallish fish but decent numbers. Lots of desirable species largemouth, smallies, little pickerel, pike and even musky. Sounds like a minature Dalrymple.  Good Luck,  ehg"
98155,Rizzo,2007-07-26 15:27:00,4754,"thanks bud, 85 views and only one reply I was beginning to wonder if it did exist.  Anyone else who knows anythng about this lake or where to launch it would be appreciated"
98172,ehg,2007-07-26 16:39:00,2666,"There is a launch on east side like 1.5 km north of Sebright off of Rd. 45. Probably that 'split rail' camp. Never fished there just drove by a few times.  Good luck,  ehg"
98185,Rizzo,2007-07-26 17:12:00,4754,"thanks for the info, I'll post a report if I get out there.  Might start at Head Lake in am, then shif over afterwards"
98190,Fishnfiend,2007-07-26 17:20:00,357,It does exist and is a very small lake.  It contains all of this fish mentioned and the comment about a mini dalrymple was bang-on as the two are connected via rivers. There may or may not be a boat launch at the community centre/library. The east end is very shallow (as indicated by the swamp/cattails.  The west end has some dropoffs. I'd stick with Head lake unless you want a boat ride on a new body of water.  There is another launch on the lake...pm if u want the details.
98247,Rizzo,2007-07-26 20:44:00,4754,"thanks fishnfiend, maybe I stick with Head Lake unless I'm being faced with the big skunkeroo, then I'll jump ship and catch me a hammerhandle at Young"
