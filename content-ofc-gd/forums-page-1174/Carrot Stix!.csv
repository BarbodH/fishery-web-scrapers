98165,Bly,2007-07-26 16:16:00,1556,Interesting......wonder if we will actually see it on the market....also wonder what would happen to it if it fell in the water  lol
98171,lookinforwalleye,2007-07-26 16:36:00,4399,Wonder why they would use Scandium it is fairly rare and expensive and demand out weighs production. As far as a rod bending like they claim who cares I don`t bend mine like that.

98189,charlesn,2007-07-26 17:20:00,551,e21 is a Toronto based company.  Big into golf and getting in to fishing.  They won some awards down at ICAST which is the fishing industry's manufacturer showcase/symposium.  Sometimes thinking outside the box is necessary for evolutionary leaps in product improvement.  Time will tell if this is one of those or not.  Charles
