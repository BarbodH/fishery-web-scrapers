97771,aplumma,2007-07-25 11:26:00,6896,I will second the vote for Rick he keeps this place and a few other running just fine.  Art
97773,Raf,2007-07-25 11:28:00,3495,what are you lookin for crazyhook  i also use dreamhost and they are ok but do go down on occasion.  awardspace.com is a decent FREE host and if I remember right have templates for quick and dirty webpages.
97918,LesCulpJr,2007-07-25 18:44:00,75,I use siterightnow.com very cheap and uses templates to build your site. Never had any prob with them in 3 years and they are very helpful and quick to deal with any issues. I don't think I've ever waited longer than 5 mins for a reply to any question. Les
97933,Uncle Buck,2007-07-25 19:16:00,1000,i use www.verio.com  no problems and it's only $9.99 US a year and includes domain registration  i made our company site with their webpage wizard  www.vipind.com
