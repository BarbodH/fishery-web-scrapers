What should we use for lakers ? raps ? spoons ?  Can anyone recommend any other lakes in the area to try if CAMP lake doesnt produce ..  Thanks all Spiro"
97906,Chugger,2007-07-25 18:21:00,109,I fish a lake in that area.  i was nailing lakers on saturday down 50 over 100 using a williams wobbler That's been my killer lure all summer for them thus far.  Good luck man!
97950,cityfisher,2007-07-25 20:00:00,959,Nice ! whats your biggest fish this season ?
98000,cthewrld,2007-07-25 23:32:00,99,You can try Lake of Bays.  Excellent Lake Trout.  Spoons seem to do the trick.
98127,Chugger,2007-07-26 14:09:00,109,Biggest thus far was only 66 cms.  Most things i seem to catch are within the slot of 40 to 55 cms.  So that one was a nice find for me!
