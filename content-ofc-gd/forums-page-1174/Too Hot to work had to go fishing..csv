98109,DT10Sam,2007-07-26 13:05:00,480,"Hi Everyone,  It certainly was a very hot day yesterday with many more to come so both Glena dn I decided that we should go fishing as soon as we close the store. Since it wasn't really a planned fishing outing we decided to target some largemouth with top water lures and then fish for some walleyes with erie rigs and hard baits. The evening was quite peaceful and the fish were co-operating.  Here are a couple of the bass that hit the top water lures.     Glen with one of his many bass.   A couple of small walleyes.       Last bite of the night was a sunfish.   It was a great evening of relaxing and fishing, with everything released.  Best regards, Sam"

98325,DT10Sam,2007-07-27 02:21:00,480,"Yes I do fish, it just happens that I have been far too tied up in business that I have not made time to fish. I will be away fishing all day on August 5th hoping to add a largemouth bass to our team stats, I will be taking Glen up to a lake that is private and the last time I was there the bass were huge. Next week I will give that salmon fishing another go at it and take Laurie out both salmon fishing and then bass fishing.  Well that is all for now until the next report.  Best regards, Sam"
