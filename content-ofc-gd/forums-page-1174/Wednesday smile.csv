He looks to see what she’s cooking, and sees one of his socks in the frying pan.  “What are you doing?” he asks. “I’m doing exactly what you asked me to do last night when you came to bed very drunk,” she replied  Completely puzzled, the man walks away thinking to himself, “I don’t remember asking her to cook my sock…”"
