If you do,did you replace them with tradtional trebles?  Also does anyone know where these body baits can be purchased besides ebay?  Thanks"

98095,charlesn,2007-07-26 11:34:00,551,"Brian, IMO the hooks are garbage.  Lose a lot of fish on them compared to gammy ewg trebles or even mustad triple grips for example.  I'd swap out the hooks but look to stay as close as possible to the weight to minimize impact on the action.  I get mine from one of the Canadian distributors - a buddy of mine.  $25 a pop for the Vision 110s.  Let me know what colours you're looking for and I'll try to get some for you.  Awesome awesome totally awesome baits.  Crappy hooks that have cost me a lot more than the $25 price tag.  The outbarb does make it easier to untangle the hooks from the line when the front hook catches the line, but that's the only advantage I've seen to them.  Charles"
