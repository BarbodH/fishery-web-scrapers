97064,tonyb,2007-07-23 14:58:00,1637,"Looking good TJ! I remember the first images of your camp, nothing but forest, it's coming along bit by bit, soon you'll just be relaxing and enjoying it.  Tony"
97086,TJQ,2007-07-23 15:16:00,7806,I figure Ill have it the way I want it by hunting season!!  Yippeeee...
97106,Roy,2007-07-23 16:06:00,13728,"Wow! That'll be big, TJ. You'll be needing paved parking and two, possibly three handicapped spaces."
97149,TJQ,2007-07-23 17:42:00,7806,Dont worry Roy... im working on your ramp.... lol
97953,aplumma,2007-07-25 20:11:00,6896,Strange I checked here in the States and short is not considered a handicap ???? must be different in Canada since Roy wants a H.C. parking space.... O well I will donate the paint to you TJ if you get the permit  for Roy's parking space.   B. Roy's L. H.   Art

97999,Aaron Shirley,2007-07-25 23:11:00,655,"Very nice TJ, well done.  The camp looks like it will be a 5 star resort  I think I'm onto you with the duck thing... will we see a trail of bread crumbs to a pot of boiling water in your next report? lol  Good fishing!  Aaron"
98353,Marty,2007-07-27 04:04:00,873,"Nice to see Poopsie doin some work.  Place is looking good.  I can't wait to see it in person.  TJ, tell us the truth.   Did you guys eat momma duck?"
96756,TJQ,2007-07-22 17:03:00,7806,"Just got back from three days up at camp, brought up my buildin'drinkin'fishin'huntin' partner Tookie, to make an attempt at putting the floor down for the new Lodge were gonna build.  Got there on Wed, and cleared out the area of trees and brush.... Went to Kirkland Lake on Thursday morning to The Castle Building Supply stire to pike up the Blocks, 2x4's and Plywood for the job... Nice store and the crew there was very helpful.   The ground over the  camp had at least 8 inches of rooty mossy pine needly crap every where which had to be removed and then filled up with sand for a sold base for the 45 blocks....  uuhhg    That morning we heard some quacking down by the dock and there was this mother mallard and her babies there so we decide to see if the would want some bread... Ive never been able to get wild ducks to come in this close...    I couldn't believe how tame the were....      I started bringing in the material, one 4-wheeler load at a time, 10 blocks, 20 2x4's and 4 sheets of plywood a load...    Then the we turned around and the ducks were outta the water and quacking for more bread!!!  So... how could ya turn them down!!    Now they won't leave the log in front of the camp!!    After a long day of hauling and leveling those friggin blocks... we decided to do a little topwater for bass, and were they ever on.. heres a couple of the nicer ones...                Then back to camp for a venison, garlic shrimp and backed potatoe dinner!!    The full next day was nothing but leveling blocks... squaring and putting together the floor.....            At one point we had to shoo the ducks away cause we were afraid to step on them.... so Tookie brought them to the other camp and fed them there......      Then another evening of work and viola... a 16 x 32 floor square and level platform for my new 16x20 Hilton from http://www.can-tex.com          Alll in all it was a great trip... even caught a nice pickeral out in front of camp, found a great new spot for minnows... saw a bear swim across the river and had a nice showing of the northern lights!!!  Going up next weekend for some R & R while the lodge gets manufactured at Can Tex... should be ready early August!!"
96758,fishergirl72,2007-07-22 17:07:00,455,"Boy now you did it!LOL, the ducks don't want to leave now   but how could anyone ever say no to them, it sounds like your weekend was pretty busy and those are some nice fish that were caught!   That dinner looked yummy!"
96765,irishfield,2007-07-22 17:33:00,26272,"Nobody ever tell you not to feed a wild animal ?? I know Monique does that every day...but...  Looks like a great new home there T.J.  Next weekend .... hmmmm ...wonder if the ""renovation supervisor"" will miss me for a few hours....."
96766,TJQ,2007-07-22 17:35:00,7806,Come on over Wayne... we will be there sat till Tuesday.....  take a break...  do ya need a map??

96807,Sinker,2007-07-22 20:37:00,8692,"Those look like black ducks to me.....still pretty friendly birds. They're usually pretty wild. Keep in mind once duck season opens, you can only kill one per day.....  Nice lookin platform too......good job!  Sinker"
96810,bigfish1965,2007-07-22 20:45:00,3382,The ducks here shake you down if you run out of bread...beat your ass and take your wallet. At least you have reasonably polite ducks.  Looks like the future palace has got off to an amazing start.
96812,danc,2007-07-22 20:53:00,4677,Looks like fun TJ. I hope to visit your lodge some day.

96971,Roy,2007-07-23 11:40:00,13728,"Art, you'll notice that there ARE no pics of TJ doing anything that remotely resembles work. That's why he brings Tookie along with him. Just in case something needs to be done."
97016,ccmtcanada,2007-07-23 13:20:00,7971," I was just going to say that...I notice that while others do the work, he just sits around and takes pictures...hmmm.... LOL.  Nice little place you got there TJ...where's my map??"
