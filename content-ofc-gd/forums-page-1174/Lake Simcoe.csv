Took out the canoe onto the lake and fished for maybe 5 hours total the whole trip.  Boated a couple decent largemouth, a nice smallie with beautiful colouration, and tons of perch and rock bass.  My dad hooked a nice 13"" perch that wouldve gone close to 2 pounds, never seen that before.  All in all a decent amount of fish for the short amount of fishing I did.  Mike  Sorry no pics yet, will post later"

I think it is something like $16 to park all day and launch a boat, but I could be wrong.  Best thing to do is pay the 25 bucks or so and camp for the night, this gives you access to the parking lot and boat launch for 2 days for free."
