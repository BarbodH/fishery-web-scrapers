97561,redfin,2007-07-24 16:14:00,79,Recently I have removed some of the flotation foam in a few places from the boat to install some equipment.  Does anyone know where I can buy some for the replacement and seal it back.  I have tried a local marine and the marine dept at BPS and neither places have it.  Thanks.

97564,Motorhead,2007-07-24 16:20:00,163,"Redfin.... Have you looked into using the spray foam??? It might not be what your looking for but then again it might be just the thing ??? Shake the hell out of the can, hold it upside down and let `er rip.... The low expansion stuff should work,  once it is dry you can trim off any excess with a sharp knife... Hope this helps  Doug"
97565,yellowboat,2007-07-24 16:22:00,211,I wouldn't use spray foam it it is a open cell foam that will retain water.
97866,mpt,2007-07-25 16:25:00,158,"The foam in a can is just as good as the foam in a boat if it's the yellow kind. The white, pink or blue foam is more closed cell but the yellow is used in the hard to get places or where it's molded right into the boat. If the yellow foam in a can was all open cell in wouldn't insulate at all which is usually what it's used for."
