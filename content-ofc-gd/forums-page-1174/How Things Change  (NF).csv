In the 60's and 70's went to concerts with long hair, happy roll your own smokes, hidden beverages and non prescription drugs...NOW short hair  ( going bald ) don't smoke and don't drink and the only pills are prescribed!  Life sure has changed!"

97935,Headhunter,2007-07-25 19:17:00,5703,That sounds like your feeling much better Gary! Great to hear and thanks for the laugh! HH
97964,misfish,2007-07-25 21:31:00,29133,"LOL Long hair,I remember those days.Unperscribed drugs,what ever do you mean   Have a good one bud."
97968,Rizzo,2007-07-25 21:35:00,4754,"the Moody Blues are still alive??? Never in my wildest dreams would I have guessed that (and yes, the play on words is intentional)"
97984,Deg,2007-07-25 22:28:00,51,Who are the Moody Blues?  I think they must have been before my time.  LOL  Gary .... I've learned age is a very high price to pay for maturity.  Enjoy the concert ... old timer (insert giggle).
98025,Clampet,2007-07-26 00:56:00,1947,"Aw, just go down to the Pool Hall and get some weed and LSD, for the concert, just like old times."
98104,Seaweed,2007-07-26 12:39:00,135,Ahhh but the tunes keep us young.  Man can I relate.  With the amount of great shows coming through Ottawa this year... I am getting flashbacks from my youth.
98142,Garyv,2007-07-26 14:55:00,547,"Well the Moody's were just fantastic.  They sounded as close to the original recordings at times you would have thought they were lip sinking ( which they were not ) I would go to see them again in an instant.  Just a great show with all the old psychedelic backgrounds, brought back a lot of memories."
