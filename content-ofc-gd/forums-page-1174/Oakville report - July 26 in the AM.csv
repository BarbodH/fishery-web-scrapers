Nothing on the lead core either. The winning spoon was green/black/silver Stinger. Trolled from 40 to 110 fow but got the first fish at 55 fow down 40' and all the rest at 82 fow down 35'. Largest fish 22 Lbs...the rest in the teens...6 for 7 was the score today when all was done. Much wormer temps today...finally... Might try Erie again tomorrow...  Here are few cell phone images for your viewing pleasure:    You can see the hitchhiker that came in with this fish:   Here is this guy again but that was his last free trip...smashed him with my pliers...     Fish was not hurt too bad by the hitchhiker so here it is swimming away:    And the last few fish:        Cheers, Ice Fisherman"
