Apparently smallmouth enjoy NOT biting my tube, soooo what better to do than go hurt some fish up at my favourite lake.  Yipee!  It was fairly amazing, I finally got into some good spinnerbait fish and a nice topwater bite.  Tubes also worked very well.  Fish were deep today, 9-12 feet on weedlines and bottom transitions, its that time of year.  My buddy Noel was up from the dirty shwa today to do some fishing and my g/f tagged along as well.  Lots of fish to be had, lots in the 2-3 pound range, a couple close to 4.   This one kicked the bucket, but its in a beer batter right now, first bass in like 5 years, honestly NOT looking forward to it.   A couple nice ones.   Kelli with her two biggest.... no dead fish haha   Noel's taliban tactics   spinnerbait fish   Nice smallie to mix it up.   wierd markings on thios topwater largie."
