I was told to try 20 lb. flouro and tie it. Would you guys use a uni to uni knot to tie the flouro to the braid and what knot do you recommend for the lure? Also how tough is 20 lb. flouro leader to tie? Thanks taper."
97952,Raf,2007-07-25 20:02:00,3495,"you should have no problems tying 20.  I tie 60.  I use a uni-to-uni to join 50lb braid to 50lb fluoro although ""they"" say you should be using a different knot for lines of different diameters.  on the business end, make a perfection loop, and attach a snap or split ring."
