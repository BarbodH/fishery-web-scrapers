I am a smaller lake fisher, basically just bass, occasional drop shotting for lake trout, some trolling etc etc. Any one have any suggestions or anything I should stay away from? I was recommended the Quantum Pti-20a, It around $90. I was only looking to spend like $100-120 for a combo.  Any help would be great!"
98132,douG,2007-07-26 14:28:00,2693,"I think you get what you pay for.  $90 is a good price point for a spinning reel (Daiwa), and Quantum are fine fine rods.  If you kick your combo price up to $200 or so, you won't be sorry.  It's only a tank of gas or so above your first guess."
98135,lookinforwalleye,2007-07-26 14:33:00,4399,I recently purchased a Shimano combo from LB`s Shimano Sedona 2500 reel and a Shimano Convergence rod total price 109.00  Seems like a good combo for the money plus the rod has a lifetime warranty!

It'll cost you a bit more than you want to spend but you'll have a combo that will last a very long time, when you figure out the cost of your combo per year it'll only work out to 15-20bux. The only thing is to outlay the cash up front. Save a bit more dough and get better quality, it'll last longer."
