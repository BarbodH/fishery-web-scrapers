98351,Dondorfish,2007-07-27 03:49:00,1000,"Thanks Kevin - great info! I know that it works wonders on the 2 stroke motors, but have never heard anyone talk about using it on inboard/outboards. My 4.3 motor is running a little rough and I thought that it might help. I'll give it a try and see what happens.  Thanks again   Don"
