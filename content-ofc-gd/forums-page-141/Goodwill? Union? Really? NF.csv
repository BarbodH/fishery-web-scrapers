954194,Big Cliff,2016-01-20 18:59:00,6899,"My problem is with a CEO that is making that kind of money and can't run a corporation that gets: all it's products for free, pays it's staff minimum wage, and can't see the writing on the wall far enough in advance to warn the staff of the pending cuts. I'll bet she doesn't miss getting a cent of what is owed to her!  Based on her previous record I'm surprised that she even got a job!"
954231,Old Ironmaker,2016-01-20 22:39:00,8243,"I wonder what a business has to pay per square foot in T.O.? Big money. If someone lives right in Toronto I would venture a guess they are not customers of discount stores. I can see how a company with zero overhead for the product loose money. Pay for the lease, common fees for the mall or plaza, utilities (try cooling and heating 25,000 or more sqft), taxes and labour etc. You could loose money before the door is open."
954235,Steve,2016-01-20 23:12:00,2075,"Well said Mr Ironmaker.  spoken from experience, clearly."
954240,Big Cliff,2016-01-20 23:19:00,6899,"She didn't just step into the job and have this dumped on her, and there is absolutly no reason she just closed the doors and left all those workers without their pay cheques and without any notice! A good CEO would have been taking steps to protect those workers and not just riding the company into the ground while putting $20,000.00 a month into her bank account."
954245,Dutch01,2016-01-20 23:43:00,1431,Clearly you're an idealist!  That's a compliment by the way
954289,misfish,2016-01-21 12:07:00,29133,"Here,s another real sick deal they are getting. NO PAY this week.  That is utter b s. I feel for the workers. This really make,s me angry.  On top of everything I didn't know about this outfit, this is just uncalled for. You mean to tell me that B$^&$ cant pay? I think there will be more to this story  in the coming days. I would be camping out along with all the other employees at her front door."
954290,Big Cliff,2016-01-21 12:21:00,6899,"Ya, no pay, no severance, can't get their ROEs so they can't get EI. That CEO should be in jail!"
954299,Headhunter,2016-01-21 13:55:00,5703,"If I heard this correctly on the news last night, the CEO was on a cruise when all this went down! She was informed, while on vacation that the finances were such that they would have to shut down. Obviously this didn't happen overnight and that the writing was on the wall well before the CEO took off for the sunny south. No regard for the the employees who did the work to line her pockets... Disgusting! I also heard that some private investors have stepped up to help them out. First order of business, fire that CEO! HH"
954308,Beavertail,2016-01-21 14:51:00,331,"I saw this story on the news last night as well, what a shame. Some of those employees seemed really down on their luck and barely scraping by, all the while the CEO is hiding out on a flippin' cruise!?!? Worst part is they couldn't even get their records of employment to start collecting EI. What the hell is wrong with people?"
954320,pics,2016-01-21 16:42:00,1268,Sadly this is the new economy.... she had to know what was going on but at 20 grand a month she was only looking to get as much for herself as possible... Camp out at her house..
954330,Big Cliff,2016-01-21 18:44:00,6899,"Put her in jail, that was out and out fraud, she had people working for her and knew she couldn't pay them but she let them keep working anyway! These are people that have little prospect of finding jobs elsewhere, many of them are dealing with issues that would make it difficult for them to hold down jobs in an everyday environment. She used and abused her position, I say she should have here assets frozen until this all gets sorted out, let her see what it feals like to be sitting there with nothing. What a slime ball!"
954350,NANUK,2016-01-21 22:53:00,797,"Many people are not aware of a lot of corruption in that organization, All that donated stuff by you and me, only a fraction was sold in Goodwill stores, Some grade A stuff just walked out the back door, Most of the stuff was sold for pennies to Second hand clothing exporters.( Exporting to Eastern Europe, Middle East, Asia and Africa ) Exporters who greased some ""Big palms"" got the biggest and the best grade shipment for literally pennies."

I will tell ya, I have bought some fine cloths from this establishment here in Barrie. If you look , you can find great deals. 2 years ago, I grabbed a 400 suit for 40 dollars. New never worn, made in Italy leather dress shoes. Leather soles to add. That you dont get eveyday for 20 bucks.  It,s a great way for many people, families, to save money. There is nothing wrong with the stuff they sell. They wash everything,  yet, anything I bought from there, I had washed or dry cleaned before using it. Many t.shirts,shorts, track pants I have bought there for 1/8 the price of new at the big stores.  Goodwill, union ? I have seen it all now. I thought they were here for the people, not them selves.  REAL SHAME.  http://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2016/01/17/16-ontario-goodwill-stores-shut-down.html"

953868,leaf4,2016-01-19 00:08:00,2466,"That seems crazy, dunno if it affects the Hamilton one in any way but its a pretty big outfit, I have done some renovation work in their offices and there are  a lot of special needs people at work for them, and from appearances, the management weren't making off like bandits the two of them drive older Hyundai's, hopefully it doesn't change anything for them"

953885,crappieperchhunter,2016-01-19 00:48:00,2582,I can't comment on Goodwill as I never go...but I used to frequent the Value Villages in Oshawa and Whitby. It has really changed in the last 5 years. Still some really good deals to be sure but the pricing has really skyrocketed. Yesterday for example Debbe and I where in Value Village because we had a $10 gift voucher that Santa had put in my stocking at Christmas. Debbe ended up browsing through the women clothing while we where in there. Then we where off to Costco. At Costco she saw some jeans she really liked for $15. Grabbed a pair to try on at home. Got home and loved them. She then told me lots of the women jeans in Value Village where $20...and this is all used stuff donated for free. Something wrong with that picture right there.
953900,ecmilley,2016-01-19 02:13:00,2163,About the biggest scam ever. A name that sounds charitable. That gets all it inventory for free and sells at a profit. Pure cash cow
953902,NAW,2016-01-19 02:30:00,4022,"My girlfriends mom lost her job at goodwill yesterday...  The union didn't fight for GW employees to make good money.  The employees there made minimum wage.  For a ceo to only make 230,000 a year.. Most Ceo's of chains that large make what...$10,000,000 a year??  Goodwill was used by so many people, who really needed it.  its sad that they shut down.  Many people are going to be very hard up now.  I was very saddened to hear the news.  I went there a few times a month.  I don't know about the aforementioned scams.  Or what ever is going on in the background.  And to be honest I don't care.  I just feel for the employees that lost their jobs, and the customers who are going to have an even harder time now that the GW doors have been locked."

953923,pics,2016-01-19 03:57:00,1268,I think it's just the Toronto area that is affected. The stores in Hamilton are doing well with an expansion planned for this year. It's too bad about the mismanagement because they provide jobs to a lot of people who would otherwise never find work..
953924,Paudash,2016-01-19 04:21:00,273,"230k a year is a low wage for CEO running a company that large, if you disagree you can spend 6 years and 300k-400k to get your MBA then you could do it as well."

Was thinking exactly the same thing. My father in-law had a saying when it came to interviewing for a job. He would say ""If you pay peanuts you get monkeys and I have never been someone's Monkey""  I had to take him at his word that he used this line as I was never at a job interview of his.  I can however say with 100% certainty that he was successful and knowing his personality I could hear him saying the words.  IMHO the CEO salary was low for the position. Those type of jobs and the work they require...well... that's just the way it is."

Some of the locations are in expensive digs. Their store on Queen St. East near Broadview would not be inexpensive I would guess.  I wouldn't be surprised if the landlords jacked up rent to drive them out. The one on Overlea Blvd in Toronto is sitting pretty on what I believe will be the next big developed area. Lots of space and close to the DVP. Gonna happen, just a matter of when and how it's developed (mixed income housing would be ideal)."
953958,Headhunter,2016-01-19 13:49:00,5703,"From what I have gathered, it seems that their cost of doing business, out stripped their income. Their rents have increased driving their overhead costs beyond their income. It boggles my mind how they could hire a CEO who has already proven that she cannot control budgets/costs. It is also my understanding that all GW's will remain closed until a solution is found. Typically, that solution will entail only the most profitable stores have a chance. HH"

954067,Mike Pike,2016-01-19 21:33:00,1332,I find it funny that people bash unions when there are job loses.  A union doesn't fire people.  A bad company fires people.  We have weak labour laws now and bad companies use them to their advantage.  It seems to me the only thing the union can do these days is make sure the employees are treated fairly during their time with the company and they get a proper severance package when they're fired( which is usually a better package at most union shops ).
