Well I just got invited on my first ice fishing trip to meme  What are the basics that I need to bring?  Rod Reel tips ups?  We have a hut, and buddies got an auger and I think he has a flasher as well.  I am heading to Cabelas to stock up on some things but I have no clue even where to start.  Any help would be great.  I have an HDS5 should I get the winter ice package for it?  Thanks"
953996,NAW,2016-01-19 16:19:00,4022,"Are you planning to start ice fishing regularly?  Because there is tons of gear that you could buy.  But if it's only for one trip, or a trip here and there..  A lot of things you can get by with out.  The reality is, if your friends have all the gear already.  All you really need is a rod and reel.  Maybe 2 set ups.  Tip-ups are my least favorite method.  I have them, but never use them.  Having an ice transducer helps.  But again, for the cost, you can get by with a summer one.  I did for years.  The ice ducer makes it much easier to set up and mark your lure in deep water.  but in shallow (30' and less) you shouldn't have an issue with your suction cup type.  I assume you have a portable unit, with a suction cup mount.  Some common gear:   You know what...  Just meet me a cabalas and give me your credit card...."

It's such an interesting hobby, you can get away with a paint stick, 4lb mono and a hook or you can spend thousands of dollars.  For now, I'd say get one decent ML rig. Will get you through most species to see if you like it."
953998,mattp33,2016-01-19 16:24:00,290,"LOL  Thanks for the tips, I'm not sure I will take it up full time as I dont have the time.  I would like to try it out tho.  The HDS unit sits on the front of my boat so it doesn't have a battery I would need a lot for that.  Think I will pass. But I will need a couple of rods by the sounds of it and some tackle.  Are the $50 combos better than the $30?  Also what size line should I be using for the walleye bite?  Do you ever use braid with a floro leader like I would in soft water?  Just caught the line comment thanks"

Just caught the line comment thanks  You can use braid and flouro (I do) if you're fishing in a nice warm hut but if you plan to fish outside you need a coated braid or it will freeze up badly. I use Tuf-Line Duracast but it has been replaced with a new version called Supercast. It is coated and doesn't ice up any worse than mono. If you can get away with the small spools of ice line pretty much any of the ice braids will work for you too."
954006,Acountdeleted,2016-01-19 16:55:00,2562,"It's like with anything, the $50 combos are better then the $39, but you don't need it. Best bet, if you have a small real from a summer combo you like, add that to a ML stick, St. Croix and Fenwick make my favs but even an Ugly stick is good.  If not, get a pre-made ML or L combo, toss out the crummy line and you'll do great."
954008,Old Ironmaker,2016-01-19 16:59:00,8243,I'm looking a tote jammed with ice fishing rods and reels. That box is earmarked for Fish Farmer that in turn donates to kids. I have a rod and reel for you. Where are you located. You might have to cover shipping. Look on Google map for Selkirk or Cayuga On that's where I am. There are a few ice fishing lures for you to start up.
954010,mattp33,2016-01-19 17:17:00,290,"Thanks Ironmaker  I am heading up tomorrow so I laft this last minute...  I see this going to be a drinkin weekend anyways lol  Thanks for all the advice guys, knew I couldn't go wrong here!"
954015,Dara,2016-01-19 17:23:00,3052,"All I ever ice fish with is a stick.  Cut a piece of 1x3 spruce about 10"" long, saw a big v in each end and wrap 17lb trilene around that. measure how much one wrap is so you can count and know how much line you put on and when you let it out you can figure the depth by counting.  You can adjust the length to make it exactly 2' if you want  Get a nice willow branch, stick it standing up in the slush from drilling the hole, put the line down, wrap it on the willow branch and put a bell on the end...poof, you're ice fishing...can't beat hand lining a 5lb laker or whitie out of 80fow.  If you're in a hut, unbend a wire coat hanger and stick it somewhere and it replaces the willow gad.  For smaller fish, use a lighter leader line..I like heavy main line because when the hole freezes you give it a boot and don't need to worry about hurting the line. Don't use braid for a hand line"

I see this going to be a drinkin weekend anyways lol  Thanks for all the advice guys, knew I couldn't go wrong here!   If you're mostly drinking, don't waste money on rods and reels...get a stick"
954017,pics,2016-01-19 17:25:00,1268,If you ice fish outdoors you may find some reels stiffen up in the cold.. If possible take it apart and remove as much grease as possible and replace that with a light oil..
954020,Old Ironmaker,2016-01-19 17:33:00,8243,I have plenty of sticks too. The offer still stands for the rod and reel.
