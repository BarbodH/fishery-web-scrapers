954042,limeyangler,2016-01-19 19:29:00,5204,"Hi all,  last week i planned to head out on the weekend with my buddy for whitefish and lakers.   As per usual the forecast for the week ahead was off, and by the time the weekend rolled sarong the mild (-15C) had turned into -31C, don't even want to think  what the wind chill was factoring in the 15kmh wind.  After a brief conversation on the phone at 4am with my buddy which was a weird mixture of wanting to back out but neither one of us wanting to make the call…we decided to go.  We got out on the lake at about 9am. Delay was due to my 4 way trailer light male connector pin snapping off, and having to attempt to splice on a spare one in minus 31C in the dark….duct tape and electrical tape don't stick to well at those temps, so I put the rolls in the microwave for 25 seconds and it worked a treat, but you had to be quick!  We set up the shack in slightly shallower than usual, we should have checked the depth before clearing the spot for the shelter, but we did not want to waste much time doing it all again and opted to try 28'FOW as a compromise that would allow us the instant comfort of the shack.  Pretty much straight off the bat there was smelt coming through in big shoals with the whitefish not far behind. They were in a picky mood today, but the aggressive ones were also around. Micro tubes in pearl (think crappie 1.5"" tubes) on an 1/8 oz jig always works on this lake and that is what they seemed to prefer today.  After about a half hour spell where there were no fish to be seen I ventured outside to drill a few holes, as soon as I got 50yrds from the shack I heard my buddy shout ""I think I have a trout!"" I ran back to the shack and he was battling some thing that was peeling drag effortlessly. Carmon had a 1/2 ounce glow whistler jig with a white double twister tail tipped with a small minnow as bait.  A lengthy 6 minute battle ensued which ended with Carmon landing a real tank! After pictures I headed back to drill some holes in slightly deeper water, it was surprisingly comfortable when the wind dropped and as soon as I dropped my jig down in 38'FOW a whitefish slammed the jig. I saw a few more but returned to the shack because my buddies fish finder battery had died and wanted to share mine with him, I'm such a considerate chap  We stayed until midday. I managed to burn a small hole in my new shelter  , and tear a hole in its cover….DOH. My camera also stopped working and ensued up using my point and shoot so did not get all the video footage of the catches…oh well, at least I can patch the tent and the camera is ok, guess it was also cold…..lol.
