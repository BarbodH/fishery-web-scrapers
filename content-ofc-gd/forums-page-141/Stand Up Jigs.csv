954555,4x4bassin,2016-01-24 00:40:00,1025,I know this is a little forward thinking ( can't wait actually ) but last summer I stumbled on to a great lake trout pattern on one of the lakes I fish and need a heavy stand up jig to fish it properly . I have looked around but can't seem to find any that are heavy enough ( 3/4 - 1 oz )  So I am in search of these jigs for this upcoming open water season and was wondering if anyone here has seen them ?  Thanks
