953413,Freshtrax,2016-01-16 05:07:00,2215,"I have a snowmobile , will travel I'm down for whatever I know a few stocked lakes we could hit but nothing spetacular south of north bay.  I'd love to fish in Kearny area as I never have before.   But really whatever works. Anyone down next weekend?    It be cool if a few of us could get together . Let's keep the location to pm's for obvious reasons."
953415,ckewley,2016-01-16 05:29:00,699,I'd be in
953518,Freshtrax,2016-01-17 00:20:00,2215,due to lack of interest ..maby a drive to trip?
953525,Joeytier,2016-01-17 01:19:00,3990,"Would love to go, but anything south of Sundridge/South River is a bit too much of a haul for me for a day trip."
953527,chris.brock,2016-01-17 01:27:00,4053,"There's a slight chance I could go if it was Haliburton,  Gull would be easy and is decent.  U thinking Saturday?"

954030,Abraxus,2016-01-19 18:10:00,104,"I would be down for a day out like that.  A lake with safe ice for sleds would make it even better.  Sled, portable hut and auger, good to go!"
954060,Sinker,2016-01-19 21:07:00,8692,"Im up for an ofc tour too, just cant make this weekend. I work every other, but keep me in the loop. I know a few spots as well  S."
954134,sleepjigging,2016-01-20 05:03:00,207,I am in for Saturday.
954135,Joeytier,2016-01-20 05:05:00,3990,"I know of a very productive, good sized splake lake behind Powassan if anyone would be down to make the trip, bit of a haul for some of you guys I guess."
954238,Freshtrax,2016-01-20 23:14:00,2215,I think were going to stick a little closer to home for this day trip as were coming from the deep south but later in the season lets do it!
954329,fishnsled,2016-01-21 18:38:00,3520,"A back lake would be fun but would depend on the weekend.  Joeytier - I'm up that way a fair amount and could possible do the Lake you mentioned, or anything else if I'm not sledding."
