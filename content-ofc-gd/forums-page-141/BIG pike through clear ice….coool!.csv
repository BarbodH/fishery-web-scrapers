Really wanted to get his kid into some fish, but the fish God's were not with us today. The leave your brake engaged on your skidoo and nearly set it on fire god's were smiling on us today though  .  Anyway, I had plenty of whitefish and a good number of trout come screaming up only not to take the bait, tried loads of different presentations but could get none to commit, none except a nice fat Pike that took a 5"" live dace minnow set at 20'FOW in 38'FOW.  Was really cool to watch it coming up through the clear ice inside the hut…..released it and she swam away to fight another day.   "

954636,Freshtrax,2016-01-24 20:09:00,2215,nice i love it then the ice is like that
954715,Old Ironmaker,2016-01-25 05:21:00,8243,"That is a neat thing to watch Simon, I really enjoyed it. Nothing like crystal clear water and seeing the fish do what fish do. Isn't it strange that if it was softwater season and going for pike guys need a medium heavy rod with 15 lb mono to bring in the same fish that you can bring up through the ice with a bendable strand of spaghetti.  Thanks mate.  There was a Rock n Rolla back in the 70's that lived in Hamilton for a spell that had the same deep voice(almost) with that British accent as do you. Long John Baldry. He played with all the big Rock N Rollas in the day including the Beatles, Elton John, The Stones and Dylan to name a few. Some pretty good company."
