953931,mike rousseau,2016-01-19 06:48:00,4661,Hello  Picked up a rod with a damaged line guide on it PM86XHF st croix premier musky rod  It's the second eye from the handle  For now the ceramic insert is held in place with epoxy but I wanna fix it right  The eye is messed up enough that i'd like it completley replaced  Question #1 Does anyone know of a rod repair guy within say 1 hour of Cornwall Ontario? Maybe Ottawa? Montreal?  Question #2 This is for the builders/repair guys.... How do I find out the make and model and size of the broken guide if I wanted to repair it myself? I inherited some rod building gear from my grandfather and this seams like a fairly simple fix  Question #3 What is a fair price to pay for a repair like this if I go that route?  Any help is appreciated... Especially from the rod artists on this board  Thanks for looking  Mike
953938,Andy,2016-01-19 11:30:00,330,I had a couple whole line guides replaced by a guy in London last year. I think it was about $20-30$ per eye.  I thought it was very reasonable.
953942,adam lancia,2016-01-19 12:31:00,234,"Look up Rovic Rods, his name is Rolly and he's in Belleville. $20 - $30 is about right."
953944,wormdunker,2016-01-19 12:48:00,1711,"PM Spiel - He is a rod builder in Hamilton, I know it's not close to you but, he'll be able to answer your other questions.  Good luck!"
953964,Lape0019,2016-01-19 14:10:00,647,"Since you said Cornwall,  Give Ed at Paddletales a call (Winchester). He has a guy who does it for him but it teaching him how to do it. It isn't all that hard. As for getting the guide, Your best bet would be to call St. Croix with the model number."
953968,Fisherpete,2016-01-19 14:24:00,1814,"Rolly does good work, I've had him replace a few guides. He's in Bowmanville though, not Belleville. Mike if you are heading this way before muskie season I can get it to Rolly and back to you for opener...  Pete"
953975,mike rousseau,2016-01-19 14:43:00,4661,Sent St.Croix a quick message the ought their website at like 2 am and they just called me. The line guide is getting shipped out today for $15 shipped.  I'll call paddletails and see what Ed says... My buddy knows him well...  if that all fails Pete I'll see about the Rolly fellow  Or speil  I was hoping to avoid shipping it... As the cost on an 8.5 foot rod would be high  Thanks for the help
953987,Garnet,2016-01-19 15:32:00,2056,"You need the right thread. Sewing machine stuff is to furry. If you have a colour in father laws stuff. I'd do it my self.  On the guide foot cut first thread with enactor knife then just unravel wrap.  Guys like rolly have neat fixture, not necessary.  Cut 1/8 strips from masking tape. Tape foot in position on your rod blank.  4lb test mono/flouo.  For your tensioning device I used phone book. Put your thread between 2 pieces of computer paper in the phone book. Further down more weight, if you have to add magazines on top. Nice tension without straining. Put thread in a bowl.  Make a loop of 4lb on bottom of blank. Now start your thread by wrapping second turn over first. And make few turns. Put tag end thread thru the loop and make about a doz turns.  Remember you can put your finger on wraps to stop process.  Slid the loop and tag end, trapping in under the wraps.  Now continue wrapping up to foot. Little hard to get on foot and the 10 wraps from guide lay your looped 4lb on the foot.  There's a little in turn from foot to guide get wraps in their.  Now tag end in loop slid it under wraps. Cut tag ends nice and clean.  It's important to not glue guide to blank.  Your kit might have 2 part clear epoxy, clear nail polish will work (not well). I've used Amoral clear varnish.  Make minor guide position adjustments and light clear coats until happy.  It sounds like a lot but every time is easier."

Mike if you are heading this way before muskie season I can get it to Rolly and back to you for opener...  Pete  Rolly recently moved to Belleville Pete.  As for replacing the guide, a fairly easy process Mike, if you want to walk you through the steps shoot me a PM."

954097,Garnet,2016-01-20 00:20:00,2056,Rolly did all my repairs when he lived 5 blocks away.  Think I will do a little demo for my bass club.
