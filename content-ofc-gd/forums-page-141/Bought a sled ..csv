954133,chris.brock,2016-01-20 04:52:00,4053,Probably a little different than the old 377 eh?  It's not my style but it's definitely a sweet sled.

954364,Joeytier,2016-01-22 01:45:00,3990,"Ya you got a helluva deal for that sled, hopefully it doesn't have any of those AC electrical gremlins"
954399,Muskieman,2016-01-22 14:46:00,2472,Apparently the gremlins were killed off in 2011
