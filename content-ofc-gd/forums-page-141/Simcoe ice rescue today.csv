954205,mr blizzard,2016-01-20 19:59:00,1589,What is he thinking going out by fox or snake or anywhere else for that matter giving the ice  Hope he is ok as well as the rescuers  Hope they hand him the rescue tab as well  I am sure the media has made it clear the ice is not stable
954211,Dutch01,2016-01-20 20:25:00,1431,It's definitely not stable in that area. There are areas nearby you can fish if you're cautious but but not there.

954216,Old Ironmaker,2016-01-20 20:55:00,8243,"Darwin award nominee. This happens my way constantly( Erie ), bill the idiot parasailer, Kayaker canoer when we have fall gales or ATV and sled operators when they go out on any ice that won't hold them. It's hazardous going on 6"" when pressure cracks are 3 feet wide."
954219,NAW,2016-01-20 21:13:00,4022,Brutal.  It's going to be a gong show out there this weekend....
954257,Fisherman,2016-01-21 00:57:00,7201,Too bad we couldn't have a live feed.  I suppose we could stand on shore and hold up evaluations for the best attempt at being an idiot.

954309,Dara,2016-01-21 15:07:00,3052,There is a group home down in that area for mentally challenged adults. Sure hope it wasn't one of them that went wandering.
954317,Terry,2016-01-21 16:21:00,14456,"There was no indication that he was a fisherman, nor if he was a resident of the island and @ 78 years old if he just wandered off.  In any case. Glad he's ok"
