953767,can u fish,2016-01-18 18:25:00,326,So sorry for your loss Beans I have been through this a few times it is not an easy thing to do.
953811,Beans,2016-01-18 21:19:00,3339,"Thanks for the kind words guys...it seems strange not having those sad eyes staring at me when I'm eating (gimme some, gimme some, gimme some)...Didn't think I would miss that but I do...  We got Chiquita five years ago...She was my sister-in-law's dog but Lee was dying of cancer and the dog was going to the Humane Society...She would have had a hope in hell of being adopted from there at the age of eight so we stepped up and brought her here...  I like to think Aunty Lee was waiting for her at that Rainbow Bridge with some cheese (Chiquita's favorite treat)..."
