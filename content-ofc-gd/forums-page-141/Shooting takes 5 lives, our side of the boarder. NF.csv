One person has been arrested, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau confirmed from an emergency press conference in Davos, Switzerland. “We all grieve with and stand with the community of La Loche and the province of Saskatchewan on this terrible and tragic day,” Trudeau said. It’s unclear whether staff members or students were amongst the victims. The RCMP has not released any details. The incident happened at Dene High School in La Loche, a remote town of approximately 3,000 people. It’s located about 600 kilometres north of Saskatoon. A nearby elementary school was put under lockdown as a precaution, RCMP said. Trudeau said he received regular updates from law enforcement officials and expressed gratitude to first responders. “Obviously this is every parent’s worst nightmare,” Trudeau said. “When I spoke with community leaders they obviously expressed that the community is reeling and all of us across this country’s hearts are going out to the family and to the whole community.” Saskatchewan Premier Brad Wall posted a statement on Facebook about “horrific events.” The community’s NDP MP and former mayor, Georgina Jolibois, said she was “shaken up” by the incident. She said her own family members were inside the school during the shooting. The region’s MLA described the school as a “beacon of opportunity and hope” for the area. “I know from working with them that the school and the staff and the kids were just fantastic. This is just devastating,” Buckley Belanger, MLA for Athabasca, told CTV News Channel. NDP Leader Tom Mulcair expressed condolences for those “affected by the shooting.” "

954465,G.mech,2016-01-23 00:41:00,830,Terrible for sure.  Does it not seem a little unusual though that the only news conferences are coming from our PM who is in Europe right now??  Wouldn't you think the RCMP or local law enforcement would be the ones holding the press conferences?  Just seems very weird and I'm not sure what to make of it....in any case it is a terrible tragedy and hits a little too close to home when it's in our country.
954470,woodenboater,2016-01-23 02:16:00,2277,Police are making sure they have all the info before they speak to the media. Place was locked down for along time so they had to make sure they had all the necessary information when they faced the press. PM was answering question asked by the media pool that follow him on every trip. I don't see anything strange about this.  The shooter is not dead so hopefully they can find out why he went on a rampage. A shooting like this in a small community will reverberate for some time as people heal and come to grips with what happened today.
