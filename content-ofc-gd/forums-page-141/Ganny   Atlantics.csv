But you can guarantee they will slow fall migrating coho Chinook Browns and steelhead to capture and process returning Atlantics. They don't just run in the summer months. Numbers of Atlantics that returned to the credit showed up in September. Good luck.   Chessy is one of the main people that run the ladder, he loves that river more than anyone  I'd trust when he says the Old Farts And Hypocrits (OFAH) will not run the ladder"

954540,Salmonidstalker,2016-01-23 22:39:00,265,"Exactly Craig. Finally, someone understands.  For the Ganny boys, I would fight this tooth and nail. Get the mnr to sign a waiver saying that other species will not be disallowed access through dam during the introduction of Atlantics. That would be a sign of good faith on their end. If they don't, well then it's quite evident what the outcome will be should Atlantics start reproducing or returning. We all saw what a few dozen returning Atlantics did to the Credit. Total shut down."

954071,Salmonidstalker,2016-01-19 21:40:00,265,Absolutely. Our limit of fish for the lake and Tribs are horrendous. Lake and charter boats destroy populations of trout.

If they continue with the current practices then I would expect to see continued returns of Chinook on the Credit.  They may very well be missing an opportunity to have far better returns; but I don't see any reason for the existing returns to disappear.  They may actually see an improvement in the returns if the wild Ganny strain of Chinooks (which will be stocked on the Bronte & Credit) provide better returns than the put & take from the Credit."

And it costs nothing to let fish swim and reproduce. They are doing it the very hard and difficult way. It's a joke.   you're trying to compare 2 completely different river systems, that both have different dynamics in fish reproduction, on the Ganny, the fish can freely pass through a majority of the main river, with only having to pass through a fish ladder.  the credit has major barriers that prevent fish from reaching prime spawning grounds on their own."

I never claimed that there isn't room for improvement.  I was just wondering why you are expecting the Chinook runs on the Credit to disappear altogether.  Or, at least that is what you wrote in your 10:48 AM post.  As long as the MNR stocks the Credit, I would expect to see returns on the Credit.  No doubt, there could be better returns if the fish were given access to more of the river."

954151,aniceguy,2016-01-20 13:27:00,1094,"interesting read from many of you.  CRAA has injected over 5 million dollars both cash and inkind within the Credit watershed.  We have achieved our 1/2millionth tree planted and just completed a multi year funding grant at habitat repair and reforestation.  We got the Ladder built at Norval by raising almost 1/2 the money MNR needed, of interest the majority of it came from a US funding source, I'm sure they would be shocked to see its not being used for anything.  CRAA for the most part has lowered temps  in the vast majority of the river below the cataract to a point that there is mile after mile of suitable habitat, currently devoid of fish.  I on behalf of the club  petitioned MNR years ago to allowed a virtually unlimited transfer of Adult Rainbow into two up stream tributaries. Mnr via Trent genetics determined brown migratory and resident fish are one in the same and the MNR biologist started moving them above Norval, life was good and we all had lots of fish to catch on the Credit,  that was also ended without any justification what so ever, which leads us to believe there was inside pressure from stakeholders within the group  We operated the streesville fishway for decades without incident as agents of the crown and as many of you are aware we recently saw record breaking rainbow trout production on the Credit as a result of the transfers.  Norval was built and all of a sudden  the other stakeholders somehow felt we shouldn't run a transfer program any longer, put pressure on MNR and we now no longer run the program are simply minions of the MNR, we all at the club wonder why as all the legal requirements are still valid and in place within the club, we demonstrated decades of success without incident, so we now watch fish brake their noses at Norval while we wait days on end for the MNR biologist to make time.  We provided a 5 year study to allow all fish species to utilize the new habitat and new fishways  it was a solid   scientific study peer reviewed by our own biologists , quietly reviewed by MNR staff outside of Aurora and was deemed a valid experiment. It was shot down by OFAH CVC TU the  MNR quietly  even said it was valid but the stakeholder apprehension wasn't worth the effort( yes an MNR manager said that exact wording to me)  In the interim the management plan which was up for an overhaul was on the table with species segregation or barrier passage a contentious issue.  CVC all of sa sudden out of no where did a study via electric shocking where a minimal brook trout population was found and created a document that EVERY and literally every biologist shown it laughed, some within MNR said it was a career ending document others  said the author killed any job movement possibilities with it, yup he is on here and I'm sure will read this, I welcome his rebuttal.  It was skewed and filled with so many errors, its only aim was to not allow migratory trout within this one river, when in fact their own data supported no change to brook trout density ( WE ARE TALKING LESS THEN A DOZEN BROOK TROUT IN TOTAL) and in fact the data showed that they all peacefully co existed.  CVC Trout Unlimited and Issiac Walton used this smoking gun to finally have the MNR Aurora district raise their hands of the entire matter and move  to the native argument, theoretical fisheries and in the end these very MNR EMPLOYEES FOCUSED ON JOB PRESERVATION rather then continue the course. We have asked repeatedly why one of the truly native fish species  from the ice age cant use the ladders for fish passage the small mouth bass and the answer is no answer and a refusal to even discuss that native fish species passage  As a result MNR aurora moved to this native thing, we wrote a very long rebuttal again reviewed by our biologists and our friends in MNR not in the aurora district, about the dangers of theoretical fisheries, asked why bass a native fish aren't allowed free passage MNR dismissed it and here we are.  We have a new district manager, when we went above his head to his boss's boss he quickly met with us to hear the concerns, he left saying he will provide answers and will work with us to achieve some common goals.  That was last spring and to date we have no response other then I ll get back to you.  For those that follow our facebook stream you can see the apprehension of our many supporters we have asked MNR repeatedly to listen to the resource users to no avail, and her we are.  The Salar program on paper is great a new fish to catch is always welcome those running it and the mythology of how its being run are flawed.  Sadly I think they have seen the ladder opening issue for salars free passage as a no go opening the ladder on the Credit for salar passage would  allow other fish into the not so special brown trout waters so rather then open the Credit up the OFAH and MNR and others will move it to the ganny, and in turn damage it and that resource hopefully not beyond saving. Its sad that someone or some group has so much influence within Aurora that this happens.  Open the damn fish ladders at Norval and Streetsville and let the fish swim.........sadly I doubt I see this in my lifetime Hope this provided some insight as to why this move on the ganny"
954162,Garnet,2016-01-20 14:39:00,2056,"Great amount of success. Lawson and I help the Credit guys and Metro East to get started likely 25 years ago. Sure makes me happy that people keep stepping up.  What I would like to know is how many MNR dollars will be spent on the Ganny directly. It could take MNR bio 20 years to make a decision on any project. The easies way to keep there job is quote Crossmans book for every question and never never make a decision.  I would like to know about bank stabilization, narrowing river bed to flush silt, spawning channels that MNR agreed to and put money into."

So many hate or don't believe in the Atlantic program, but I think this would be the most productive way to give like I said, true honest evaluation of the program.   Ok back to reality, I know this wont happen, but it,s what I think should be done. If your going to spend the money, then do it right is all."

They've benefitted from the ""return the mighty Atlantic"" nonsense.  So as a steelheader at heart, I'm all for it now!  Took many years before I caught on lol.  Bring on the Atlantic program on the ganny!!!  They are going to waste money on something, so the ganny might as well get a new counter and some trees planted."

953985,John Bacon,2016-01-19 15:23:00,3277,"The new direction of the MNR is focused on Atlantic Salmon and Brook Trout only. Everything gets a back seat as far as I'm concerned no matter what is done on behalf of other salmonids. If my home river was the Ganny, I would be concerned.  Also keeping in mind the MNR is now shifting Chinook egg collection there as well, they will destroy that river like they did the Credit.  Only a small percentage of the eggs are being collected on the Ganny.  The bulk of the collection is done on the Credit.  The Ganny eggs add some genetic diversity, earlier spawning fish, and wild fish to the population.  I doubt that they will ever stock the river with Chinooks.  The MNR has recently increased Chinook stocking from a target of 540,000 per year to 600,000 per year.  They are also modifying the brown trout stocking program in order to improve the fishery and are considering adding an additional river for coho stocking (The MEA manages the coho program; but we require MNR approval).  So I don't agree that other species are taking a back seat to the Atlantics."

954005,Old Ironmaker,2016-01-19 16:51:00,8243,"I am not a Salmon fisherman but love to learn. Is there a significant difference between Altantic and Kings? I can now tell between a Steelhead and a Coho, I can recognize a Brown Trout now but haven't caught one. Is there some scientific reason they are choosing to introduce Atlantic on the Ganny when it didn't work on the Credit River"
954025,Salmonidstalker,2016-01-19 17:49:00,265,"No, they are just a bunch of bozos trying to stick a square peg in a round hole.  If I was part of any organization to go with the Ganny I would be up in arms. They will sell you on rehab and benefits for all species but in the long run its natives they want and everything else will be pushed aside.  There are individuals within mnr and the political background asking why we even have rainbows Browns chinooks etc. and are pushing for all native species reintroduction."
954029,Garnet,2016-01-19 18:08:00,2056,Atlantic are a heritage species. They run the rivers spawn and return to the lake till next year. Think it's up to 3 spawns.  Chinnooks return ounce and die.  Atlantics are as dumb as a post. They will hit any thing flashy and bright. That's why flash on your fly's is illegal. And that's why fly fishing only.  Again I ask name the river and explain the project and supply the proof that tree plant reduce river temps or reduced silt.
954035,Salmonidstalker,2016-01-19 18:44:00,265, Are you asking for proof that planting trees on the banks of rivers reduce temps and silt levels???

I had my blinders on when the Atlantic program intensified on the Credit. We all thought it would benefit all species. Guess what, it didn't. And that is a fact.  How do you figure that?!  There's no chinnies in the credit cause there's zero return from the runs..  The chinny fishery around Port Credit is pretty much %100 put and take.  And it's gonna stay that way, because of the barriers up-river to suitable spawning areas..  ie. Streetsville and Norval - The most epic waist of money from the ministry of no results, IMO)  On the opposite side of the spectrum, the chinny fishery around Port Hope is mostly natural..  because those returning fish have access to proper spawning grounds.  I think the MNR in shifting towards the Ganny because... ding ding ding, they're realising that regardless of how much stream rehab is done on the Credit, the return is gonna nill if you don't remove those barriers to fish migration!!  If the atlantics are not allowed to do their thing on their own, then you can forget a self sustaining run of salars.."

Why would the Chinook disappear from the Credit?  The MNR is continuing to stock the river."
954058,Garnet,2016-01-19 21:05:00,2056,"Yes I'm asking for specific projects. When they where done, how they done, who paid for them. Real dollars spent on the river for improvement."
954059,Sinker,2016-01-19 21:05:00,8692,I was going to ask the same question.....
954063,Salmonidstalker,2016-01-19 21:27:00,265,"their stocking practices are pour and their track record has proven this.  (Brown trout stocking, Chinook stocking and Atlantic stocking)  Which is why they are trying to change their ways.  Bottom line, when fish can spawn on their own, fisheries will flourish."
