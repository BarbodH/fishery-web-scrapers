953917,ccmtcanada,2016-01-19 03:19:00,7971,"I've been an Eagles fan since I was a teenager, but never got to see them until the Hell Freezes Over tour.  I was blown away at how tight they were....and their harmonies were pitch perfect.  The Eagles influenced me big time....both in guitar as well as vocally, and Glenn Frey was a big part of my musical development.  A true music pioneer is gone....RIP Glenn....thanks for everything."
