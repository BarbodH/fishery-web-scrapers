954147,Acountdeleted,2016-01-20 12:53:00,2562,https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=4zg3DSTG53I  Not sure if this was the same quad. The blue ice report posted the extraction process of a Quad on Cooks bay. Even just 4-5 FOW this looks like a massive pain in the butt.
954177,jimmer,2016-01-20 15:58:00,2730,What a pain.
954186,DRIFTER_016,2016-01-20 17:06:00,10439,The reason it looked so hard is because they don't have a clue how to do it properly. Much easier when you put up an A frame to get lift on the vehicle.

953751,bobowski,2016-01-18 17:27:00,360,Be careful out there guys. A Quad went through the ice this morning about 100 yards off shore on cooks bay. I'm hearing the driver is safe. With the recent snow covering the ice it will be difficult to spot the sketchy ice.

953760,Gallie,2016-01-18 18:06:00,1215,"There are already huts out off glenwoods smh, just because some of it is ""safe"" doesnt mean it all is. This happens every year and always will. If you have to go then take the necessary precautions, leave the machine at home for now."
953763,Acountdeleted,2016-01-18 18:17:00,2562,Wha? You mean three inches of ice isn't enough to support a sled?!?! Why didn't anyone tell me.  ....... Oh....... Wait.......  Glad no one was hurt though.
