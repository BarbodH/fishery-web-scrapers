954002,Dutch01,2016-01-19 16:45:00,1431,I've had this problem before.... There is a button on the main page. It's the same colour as the background though so you can only see it after you click it!  I made a screenshot for if it ever happens to you again.  
954024,captpierre,2016-01-19 17:45:00,2521,Main page. Didn't see it Thanks Dutch!
