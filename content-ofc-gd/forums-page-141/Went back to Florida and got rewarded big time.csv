We started out by going to the marina to catch bait fish. For some reason they weren't biting, but a charter boat came in and gave us two grouper carcasses and a kingfish carcass after fileting them. We had big baits! Went out that night and had one run but I set the hook too soon, not factoring that big baits means you have to give the shark the time to eat it.  The next night we went out. I had a run right at sunset and lost it just 50 yards out. I was very upset now being 0/2 but put another bait out. An hour later the reel went off, a long, slow, but steady click. Could it be a winter Bull shark?!? I set the hook and we were on. A half hour later I landed the biggest shark of my life. A 8' 250lb bull. Amazing. The video is here:    On our last night we had 3 runs. The first dropped it. The second straight ""freight trained"" my brother eventually breaking him off, I think it was another bull or even a tiger. The third we landed and it was a nice Sandbar shark. Overall amazing weekend!"

952986,chris.brock,2016-01-13 03:30:00,4053,"That looks like a lot of fun, especially since it's snowing sideways where I am right now.  Awesome video!"
952988,Toronto_Angler,2016-01-13 03:46:00,698,looks awesome! How did you find a $100 flight??
952989,adempsey,2016-01-13 03:52:00,1498,"Shark fishing is always so intense!   I hate going into the ocean at night though, lol.  Also interested in how you find cheap flights like that.   Best I saw was $235 round trip from Windsor to Orlando with a new airline, National Air."
952990,PBenson,2016-01-13 04:50:00,154,Honestly I just look through different websites for deals. They weren't good flights (Thursday at 9am and Monday at 6am both with Spirit) but I'll take anything if I can get to Florida for cheap.
952997,Shloim,2016-01-13 11:54:00,515,"Awesome video! Id love to try that one day. I think any flight under $300 is quite cheap. Sometime spirit has super cheap deals out of Buffalo and many inexpensive hotels have deals with parking. Driving home afterwards sucks though, we did it once and saved a bundle on a vacation to Jamaica."
953114,Steelheadphycho,2016-01-13 23:48:00,470,Fishing bare foot in January...... ILL TAKE IT!!  Thanks for sharing!
953150,PBenson,2016-01-14 13:18:00,154,"Haha you know you're becoming a Florida fisherman when it's 18 degrees celcius and you claim it's ""cold"""
953152,woodenboater,2016-01-14 14:02:00,2277,cool video ! never thought I'd read about someone catching and releasing a bull shark here lol. that shark woulda put your team over the top here
953473,DRIFTER_016,2016-01-16 18:49:00,10439,This beach shark fishing blurb showed up in my facebook feed this morning. Although not Florida it is really awesome!!!!  http://www.theonlinefisherman.com/reel-news1/two-mega-sharks-caught-and-released
953608,PBenson,2016-01-17 18:00:00,154,Yeah man those pictures have basically gone viral... Crazy how big they are. Those things will put the biggest reels money can buy to the test.
953609,DRIFTER_016,2016-01-17 18:16:00,10439,I like how the hammerhead pulled 1/2 mile of line several times.
