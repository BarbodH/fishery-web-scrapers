954131,Joeytier,2016-01-20 04:30:00,3990,"Picked up a 2016 Polaris Indy Voyager 550, 144 in. track. Amazing boondocking and trailbreaking machine....gonna be a long-term honeymoon phase with me Haven't had much time for any serious trips lately but the ling action has been absolutely off the charts on the Ott river now that the ice has set up in our little bay. Averaging 15-20 fish in the first couple hours after dark. Mostly 18-24 in. fish, no hawgs yet. We bring out the portables, heaters, and have a great time."
954136,chris.brock,2016-01-20 05:07:00,4053,"I think you and that Indy are going to have some crazy adventures and good times.  I wish I had a spot near my cottage for night shift ling, it would probably be a mad house on the ice some nights."
954137,Joeytier,2016-01-20 05:20:00,3990,Your laker spots should produce ling after dark?
954139,chris.brock,2016-01-20 05:34:00,4053,The odd one. Most nights it's a skunk.
954146,Acountdeleted,2016-01-20 12:42:00,2562,Good ole ell-pout. Those are delish.
954148,Rod Caster,2016-01-20 12:59:00,5784,She looks great with a sleigh behind her! Good linging bud. You'll find your ling ball soon.
954152,mr blizzard,2016-01-20 13:41:00,1589,"Nice outfit, the honey moon will last for years, "" by the powers invested in me I pronounce u man and machine, u may squeeze the throttle""  Oh ya the fishing doesn't look bad either"
954155,NAW,2016-01-20 14:06:00,4022,Nice!!  Now you can tow the bravo out of the slush pits!!
954156,NAW,2016-01-20 14:07:00,4022,Nice ling by the way!  That's a tasty looking pile of meat!!
954158,Court R,2016-01-20 14:16:00,213,Nice! I cooked up a bunch of ling for a few buddies up north one year and they didn't know it was Ling I did a bowl with lake trout and one with the ling and they all loved the ling way better then the laker.
954161,Acountdeleted,2016-01-20 14:38:00,2562,"One of the best fish IMO. Boil it and dip it in garlic butter. For saving $9.95 a pound, I'll take it over lobster."
954183,Muskieman,2016-01-20 16:46:00,2472,Nice sled Joey ! We'll need to plan something while winter is here !
954188,Joeytier,2016-01-20 17:38:00,3990,There may have been some excessive pre-marital throttle squeezing...
954207,mr blizzard,2016-01-20 20:04:00,1589,Lol what goes on in the great outdoors stays in the great outdoors lol. And I don't blame u? at all?
954217,davey buoy,2016-01-20 21:00:00,5505,"Nice outing Joey,the sled looks great."
954248,Freshtrax,2016-01-20 23:50:00,2215,love the new sled.   im going to swap a 144 skid under my 121 700 this off season
954255,Gallie,2016-01-21 00:48:00,1215,Sweet ride! nice fish too!
954270,Joeytier,2016-01-21 03:51:00,3990,"Awesome.  Seen a few XC's with 136 rails, killer sleds almost considered getting one."
954271,PUMP KNOWS,2016-01-21 03:56:00,937,"One of the best fish IMO. Boil it and dip it in garlic butter. For saving $9.95 a pound, I'll take it over lobster.  I never ate ling before but this makes me want to try it this year."
954275,DRIFTER_016,2016-01-21 04:44:00,10439,Tastes good pan fried or beer battered too.   
954279,Old Ironmaker,2016-01-21 05:31:00,8243,"That there is one sweet ride Joey, a read head turner. We would catch a few on Nip trolling for Pics. We released them. Then I had some at a neighbours on Nipissing, man good or what. They only take the loin. That's when I was told they sell ling as scallops in North Bay. How are they cleaned?"
954365,Joeytier,2016-01-22 01:49:00,3990,"I clean them similar to walleye but focus more on the backstraps, the belly meat is no good.  The yield of good quality meat is actually pretty small for the size of the fish."
954366,DRIFTER_016,2016-01-22 01:56:00,10439,I clean them like a cat fish. Slice around the head and then using a pair of pliers peel back the skin. Then remove the meat. Much easier than trying to fillet off the skin to normal way.
