Having first used my 16,000 BTU 20lbe'r propane heater ,noticing around 3pm,we had almost 1.5""'s of water in the hut.No snow on the ice so to speak.We decided to leave then as we know now the ice was melting on top at a incredible rate.It was nice to be warm,Just a heads up guys,even with the windows and door open part way at -6,not counting the windchill,things can happen fast. I'll be sorta glad when the ice gets too at least 6"" or greater.We will not have to worry about the heat factor. Be careful everyone with this mild air coming in."
954806,Joeytier,2016-01-25 21:24:00,3990,That's quite the heater.  My 4 000 BTU heater works wonders in my 4-man I can only imagine what kinda heat that thing doles out.

That is on the low setting,we changed over to the small 1lb propane stove top burner a couple hours earlier once the sun came out.Will be nice early in the day to take the chill off."
