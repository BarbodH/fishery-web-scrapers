954475,Roy,2016-01-23 03:09:00,13728,"Yeah, that sure is hilarious. Can you imagine? The nerve of some people calling you up to offer their condolences......"
954479,FloatnFly,2016-01-23 05:16:00,1640,"If you can't find the humour in everything, life and death, then I feel sorry for you.  The fact that this guy basically told the PM to take his canned speech and shove it and then proceed to just hang up on him, and then go public with it, IS funny."
954497,cram,2016-01-23 16:02:00,1733,The crickets are deafening......
954502,KLINKER,2016-01-23 17:21:00,256,"I thought it was just odd, accused the PM of political blabbing and then take the opportunity to do some political blabbing. Gives the impression that hatred of liberals overrides personal loss and nothing is personal anymore.  Sad thing is the PM has some more calls to make."
954585,wormdunker,2016-01-24 08:51:00,1711,I don't find that humourous at all!  I find it very distressful for the families involved.
