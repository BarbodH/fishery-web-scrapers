546423,Ron,2011-02-01 20:10:00,1683,"Hey all,  Just curious as to who is planning in attending this Festival? I helped out last year and there was a great turnout. There was not one kid who didn't walk away with a prize. This year, apparently, there is even more free stuff to give away! If you don't have plans, bring your kids, grandkids or even your neighbourhood kids along for a great day on the ice. There will be hot dogs, hot chocolate, and the fish you catch will be cleaned and served back to you deep fried. I am sure if you are looking to help out, you won't be turned down either. Last year I had about 40 kids go through my hut, helping each one catch a fish and give them a chance to see how the fish finder, camera and space heater works. Most of these kids were impressed, along with their parents on how comfortable ice fishing can be. A lot of great memories were made. Particularly when we had a Muskie show up on the camera and the one kid screamed his head off! I even had one young lad catch a fish, run up to get the perch cleaned, come back and share it with me so he could in turn, get back in line to catch another!  This year, I am helping out with Frabill Ice huts. We will have 3 or 4 huts set up so kids can take turns fishing out of the cold with their parents and enjoy the day. Rumour has it there will be our own little prize packages being given out to the young anglers too.  Let me know if your going so I can be sure to look for ya.  Don't forget, this is the free fishing weekend so no one needs a fishing license. This means you can bring anyone along to enjoy the day.  Bridgenorth Panfish Festival  Cheers, Ron..."
