551781,smally21,2011-02-15 18:25:00,993,"the best way to win in traffic court is to never end up there.  traffic offences will almost always be your word against the officer's.  no judge is going to side against the officer, because he is the highly trained professional and you're the wreckless law breaker (not to mention judges might forget their signals once in while too).  examinations of the officer are next to useless - anything prejudicial to the crown's case will just be met with some answer like ""I dont recall"".  anything handy to your case will be picked apart and spun until it makes you look more guilty than when you started.  and the judge doesn't get bonuses for lettin' people off.  you're best hope in traffic court is to hightail it to the prosecutor and beg for mercy. they'll reduce your charge if you're super respectful and polite.  the justice of the peace will listen to hardship cases and excuses before a judge will, and almost always reduce fines and increase time to pay.  traffic court is a joke. stay out of there my friends!!!!!   just caught the 'parade' story.its great - never heard it before."
551782,POLLIWOGG,2011-02-15 18:27:00,835,"Its a friendly world when you ride a vintage bike and don't have signal lights, everyone waves at you, and you know that the guy behind you will pass you every time you slow down to turn left because he thinks your waving him to go ahead. Then try doing it at night, You are waiting for traffic to clear so you can turn left and you hear the left lane hog behind you brake hard and swerve to miss you, makes your heart stop."
551786,smally21,2011-02-15 18:45:00,993,good point polliwog - the hand signal represents exactly that! i know the bike doesn't require turn signals - but are there stipulations on night driving without signals?

551806,solopaddler,2011-02-15 20:14:00,8605,"  The kicker was it was a nothing ticket. 68km in a 60km zone.  I was in a huge lineup of heavy traffic, during a rainstorm at the time to boot.  The cop jumped in front of my vehicle at the last second, motioning for me to go to the shoulder.  After almost running him over I did.  In court when it was my turn to question the officer I asked him: ""Officer, is it possible a radar gun may not function properly during a rainstorm?""  ""Yes"" he answered.  I was like Perry Mason when I whipped out the hard copy evidence I had of rainfall amounts that day   (I work at the weather office and have access to that info).  I figured it was done and over with, that I'd won (boy was I wrong  )  So the judge started lecturing me.  As mentioned I asked him what gave him the right to be so judgemental LOL!  Well, during his red faced diatribe about wasting the courts time, etc., etc,  he says to me: ""Nowhere in any of your statements did you say you actually weren't guilty of speeding!!""  ""Excuse me!"" I interupted him again, ""But doesn't pleading not guilty speak for itself?""  After that there was a lot of red faced gavel banging and I pretty much tuned him out.  The lady at the cashiers desk where I paid my fine said she'd never seen such a large fine tacked onto such a minor offense in 25 years working there."
551823,solopaddler,2011-02-15 21:03:00,8605," I was incredibly polite and well spoken, not nervous at all. Until I knew it was a lost cause then I got a bit lippy. Paid the price for it too.  I agree with you 100% though, it is your right to request a hearing.  What is it with some judges? They're so judgemental."

551654,smally21,2011-02-15 02:07:00,993,"if a tree falls in the forest.....  like FFA says, to not affect traffic would mean no one to affect - including no traffic officer to issue the ticket.  at which point you could also talk on your cell phone.  so yeah - you dont need to signal when no one is around, but then who would know what you did. if you got a ticket then someone was around. its not really a signal if no one receives it. im gonna stop typing now."
551656,Bernie,2011-02-15 02:11:00,3190,"Just for a side note, when doing a safety inspection on a car in Ontario, signals do not have to be working. I can't fail a car because they don't work. Same as brake lamps. Law reads one tail lamp and license plate lamp only required on the rear.  The reason being is because you can use hand signals. Does anyone know how to do this? There are several other crazy things pertaining to safety's."
551659,solopaddler,2011-02-15 02:18:00,8605,"  That my friend is the rub. Exactly what is the literal definition of ""not affecting"" anyone, at least as far as the HTA is concerned?  It seems to me that it's more than a little subjective.  Nowhere in the HTA does it say ""when the road is devoid of vehicles"".  Is it ""no other vehicles within four car lengths back in both directions""?  Is it ""no other vehicles within half a km in both directions""?  Nothing is spelled out clearly, it's completely ambiguous. The way the HTA reads, it seems as though it's up to the drivers discretion.  A good lawyer would have a field day with one of those tickets the way the HTA is written now."
551664,mercman,2011-02-15 02:37:00,7054,"it seems alot of our laws are open to interpertation.When they were written,i dont supose they could ever have thought of half the scenarios that happen on the roads today.They need to be re written, or at least ammended. Im the mean time, its up to police to interpet the laws as best as possible, and drivers to practice the safest possible defensive driving habits. That is the best thing to do.Mandatory or not, the safest thing to do, is signal.Thats all."

For some things it's not clear like signalling turns. Others are cut and dry, why do you think the media tells people to treat a intersection with the traffic lights out like a four way stop....to avoid chaos because in the hta it doesnt say treat it like a four way lol"
551683,solopaddler,2011-02-15 03:21:00,8605,"  This is true. I've fought two traffic violations in court because I truly believed I was right.  The first one I had a useless lawyer who did nothing for me.  The second one I represented myself. Thought I was doing pretty well until the judge interupted me with a lecture.  I interupted the judge and asked ""what gives you the right to be so judgemental?"".  Never ask a judge why he's so judgemental! Very bad things happen.  "
551701,Dara,2011-02-15 04:14:00,3052,"I got pulled over for not signaling. There was no traffic to affect. The cop that pulled me over was in a parking lot so I wasn't affecting him. He saw my point and let me go. The only reason I knew this is because another cop had told me about the signaling law previously.  If you are in a left turn lane and turning and there are vehicles coming toward you, they gotta know you plan on turning in front of them. They don't know you aren't from out of town and don't know what lane to be in.  Laws are written ambiguously so that its easier to charge and convict.  Read a few tax laws and see how easy it is for them to stick it to you"

I've heard some funny stuff in court though...it usually comes when people try to defend themselves.  I remember one time I was sitting watching a guy defend a 15over speeding ticket, reduced from 30+ over and he starts ""your honour I think you should cancel the ticket. I believe the officer was completely wrong. In the officers notes it says that there was a parade at 600hrs. The officer wrote me a ticket at 630. How could I be speeding at the very spot a parade was taking place?  The court room was silent...crickets lol...  Then everyone tried hard not to laugh. The JP just shook his head and said sir, parade means the officers preshift meeting.  Needless to say his defence was shot down and he paid the full ticket not the 15 over"
551376,chessy,2011-02-14 14:36:00,610,just wondering if any one knows about this .... making a left hand turn in a left hand lane . do you need to put on a signal light if no oncoming traffic .

551396,Old Man,2011-02-14 15:59:00,822,"Taken from the Ontario Highway Traffic Act.

551411,mercman,2011-02-14 16:27:00,7054,  Why would you NOT signal though?? its the safe thing to do even if its not mandatory.
551416,Old Man,2011-02-14 16:32:00,822," Agreed. It take less effort to signal all the time than it does to check in all directions to see if there maybe someone who is affected by your move. Also, ""affected by your move"" is always open to interpretation by yourself, other drivers and the police. Safest and easiest just to signal all the time."
551425,irishfield,2011-02-14 16:39:00,26272,The moral is... if there is a cop there to write you the ticket.. then the operation of another vehicle can be affected!

551440,Fish4Eyes,2011-02-14 17:00:00,1022,"It takes less effort to just signal, as opposed to looking around you to ensure nobody is around so you don't signal.  It would be nice if all of our officers would lead by example though  ."

551448,Fish4Eyes,2011-02-14 17:14:00,1022," My favourite is when they brake hard in the through lane, when they have a turn lane they can decelerate in to make the turn"
551455,solopaddler,2011-02-14 17:24:00,8605,"  Years back I almost rear ended an older lady who had come to a complete stop with her indicator light on at the end of an on ramp.  Another time an old Scotish gent a few cars in front of me was rear ended by the car behind him 'cause he stopped at a red light.  After the accident I heard him say ""Well, I thought it was going to turn red, that's why I stopped"".  Nothing like a cautious old Scotsman.  My real pet peeve that happens everyday is people in front of me on an on ramp who don't accelerate to merge safely with the traffic. Drives me nuts."
551458,irishfield,2011-02-14 17:27:00,26272,I think we're also missing part of Chessy's question... you are in a mandatory turn lane.. that is dedicated to making a left turn.. do you need to signal as well?
551462,Governator,2011-02-14 17:39:00,879,"Please always signal, I'm so sick of the odd person not signaling when they cut me off.  Sure they can get away with it when there isn't other cars around, but it's the 1 time they forget to when changing lanes that causes the accident.  If you do it every time than it just becomes a habit...  It should be routine for everyone..."
551464,Governator,2011-02-14 17:42:00,879,  Apparently not according to the law.  However when you are driving towards an intersection it's often difficult to tell if the car opposite of u is in a dedicated left hand turn lane or if it goes straight through.  A simple signal tells u if you get a yellow light you're best to stop if you can so the person can make their left.  Just my opinion.
551466,Old Man,2011-02-14 17:51:00,822," As it's written in Part 10 Section 142 of the Highway Traffic Act, there is no mention of dedicated/mandatory turns lanes, so as written Section 142 (1) would apply to all turns."
551541,aplumma,2011-02-14 21:06:00,6896,I even signal lane changes....It's not like you are wasting electricity. If an accident results and you signaled correctly it might be difference between paying or not paying a lawsuit.  Art
