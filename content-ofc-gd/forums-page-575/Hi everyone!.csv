551884,Jacob,2011-02-15 23:56:00,186,"Hi everyone!  My name is Jacob Beaudoin, I'm 14 years old, I've fished all my life and two years ago I also started fly fishing and tying.  My favourite fish is Smallmouth bass and at a close second is Pike.  I fish the Grand River readily for smallies and Catfish, this season I'm thinking of trying to get some steelhead when trout season opens.  I also fish Kushog Lake for smallies and Pike and this season I'm hoping to get some Lake Trout.  I've been reading all of the awesome info on this site for a long time so I decided to join."
