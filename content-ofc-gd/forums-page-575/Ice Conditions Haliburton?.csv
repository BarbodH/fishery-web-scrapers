551489,Nemo,2011-02-14 19:05:00,727,Heading up to Haliburton for Family Day Weekend.  Does anyone have an update on the ice conditions.  Was worried about the slush everyone is reporting elsewhere.  Thanks  Nemo

It's also going to get milder as the week goes on.  However, there seemed to be lots of ice, just messy. Always take care on some of the bigger and deeper lakes."
