It's about 6 years old, I remember paying over $500 for it so that shows how long I've had it.  If anyone knows a place that would repair it or can offer me some advice it would be greatly appreciated.  thx"

551251,dada2727,2011-02-14 01:13:00,108,"Thanks for the help guys.  Cleaned the connections like irishfield said and put some fresh batteries in it and viola!  Man I messed around with that thing for hours, taking it apart and cleaning the inside of it and everything!  Thanks for the help fellow OFC'ers!  Now I'm all armed and ready for simcoe friday!"
