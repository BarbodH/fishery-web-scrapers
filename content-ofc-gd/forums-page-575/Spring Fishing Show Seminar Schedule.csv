550691,Gregoire,2011-02-12 16:02:00,1397,"I noticed they had dog stuff, can I bring my dog. Also is there an extra charge for the musky seminar on monday?"
550695,lew,2011-02-12 16:14:00,12766,"  Greg, if your interested in musky fishing you may want to take in the Musky Odyssee in St. Catherines in April, unles your already familiar with it.  Lotsa vendors and some excellent seminars."
550724,Gregoire,2011-02-12 16:52:00,1397,"Definitely interested, just not sure if I'll be able to devote that much time as I live downtown Toronto."
550754,d_paluch,2011-02-12 17:39:00,343,"I'll be there saturday...want to get there early, but also want to see Italo...probably be there for 11-ish.  What is one to expect at this show? I've never been..."
551237,brifishrgy,2011-02-14 00:47:00,559,No Mercer this year
551244,uglyfish,2011-02-14 00:57:00,981," nope, hes gonna be in lousiana for the bassmaster classic as the emcee."
551255,Dave Mercer,2011-02-14 01:18:00,148,"Sorry All, No I will not be at the Spring Fishing show this year. I really wish I could be there but I will be down in New Orleans for the Bassmaster Classic at the same time. The cool thing is the show will be picking up the tournament weigh in feed so I guess I will kinda be there lol. I will miss seeing you guys this year but I will have a seminar at Bass Pro Shops March 27th at 1pm if you guys can make it I would love seeing you there. Take care Dave"
551261,SRT8 smoker craft,2011-02-14 01:46:00,1107,Hopefully going sunday to the show. And it figures I am going to BPS on the 26th only day I can go so I will miss Dave
551380,bigbuck,2011-02-14 14:44:00,2449,Looks like I may miss Pete Maina this year. I'm going to go on Friday afternoon and hopefully I'll get to see Gord Pyzer and his protege Jeff Gusstafson.
551407,motion,2011-02-14 16:20:00,403," Funny, I was thinking the same thing. Anybody know if dogs would be welcomed to the show?"
551441,Whitemikeca,2011-02-14 17:00:00,138,"Crap, I was really looking forward to seeing a James Linder seminar but it looks like he is not making the event anymore.  I am really excited to see Mania and Saric though.  Italo should not get stage time IMO.  Does anyone actually like this guy?  Aside from his past adventures in poaching, he is just plain boring and it always seems like he is talking down to his audience as if they were children.  I would much rather see Jeff Gustafson get some time with the tank stage."
