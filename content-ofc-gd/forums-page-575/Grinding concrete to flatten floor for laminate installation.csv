549770,Fish4Eyes,2011-02-10 13:13:00,1022,"I want to lay down laminate flooring in my living room but I have a section where the concrete floor is not flat (has a crest) and it is not allowing the flooring to click together properly, nor does it look good as there is a big hump. The room is already painted so I would hate to to get it all dusty from grinding. Is there such thing as a dustless grinder that you can rent? If not, any other suggestions? Thanks in advance."
549775,BUSTER,2011-02-10 13:27:00,1336,"You have to grind down high spot or raise low lying area with self leveling cement, little sprinkle of water and shop vac while grinding for dust control."

549788,Rod Caster,2011-02-10 13:53:00,5784,"I had the same issue, albeit much worse as the WHOLE floor was uneven. I poored self-leveling concrete over the low spots to even things out. I used nearly 30 bags of it. Although I could have done a better job with the self leveler...it did work well. Sounds like you are in a different position since your place is already mostly built...mine was fully gutted.  Like other have suggested, chipping it away might be your best bet (keep dust down)...there are also some types of industrial grinders you can rent, but in my experience they are hard to find and the dust they kick up is quite messy."

550203,brkygetr,2011-02-11 02:03:00,425," Firecat has the right idea... Unless I am wrong these folks are Blastrac Canada...they have what you want (but you have to buy it). I do this for living (Epoxy flooring/concrete refinishing specialist). You want to rent a diamond grinder from someone (possibly United??? Not sure if they have any)and a small vac. It can be ground out level in a very short time. It will create dust...a VERY small amount though for what you are accomplishing. Biggest thing is that you have to CONSTANTLY keep the grinder moving..you can dig holes quick! Use a small circular motion(twice the head of the shroud) and let the grinder do the work, do not push, and keep the grinder handle LEVEL. This will eradicate your bump quickly. 15 min work."
