551266,ColdH20guy,2011-02-14 02:30:00,312,hi guys another minor problem we found tonight..we went to do a load of laundry and the pile of clothes that was on the floor beside the furnace was soaked..its in the middle of the house so no leaks from exterior walls..its almost as if the furnace has leaked water from above..although the carpet was wet as well?...it does have a humidistat on the side of it but its dry as a bone..its a Ducane high eff. propane furnace...I am going to call someone in the morning just curious if I could hear any thoughts  here first... thanks guys
551268,danc,2011-02-14 02:32:00,4677,Plugged condensate drain or leaking humidifier?
551275,ColdH20guy,2011-02-14 02:40:00,312,thanks Dan..my wife said thats what she said lol
551276,mercman,2011-02-14 02:40:00,7054,Wouldnt be directly below the melt spot on your roof would it Could the water be coming from the washer instead.
551279,express168,2011-02-14 02:50:00,327,"Even if the condesate pipe leaked it likely would not have been enough water to soak a pile of clothes and the carpet, likely came from another source."
551280,dannyboy,2011-02-14 02:51:00,367,"If it has a forced air humidifier in the area the float valve may be stuck, check if there is a valve coming off a cold water line that you can turn off.  The leak can show up anywhere downstream.  Dan"
551282,ColdH20guy,2011-02-14 02:59:00,312,thanks guys...i unscrewed the humidifier on the side of the furnace and it is dry as a bone..its almost as if the water came from under the furnace?
551285,irishfield,2011-02-14 03:02:00,26272,Manifold clogged and it going down the cold air return into the furnace base?  Should be a line to a valve on a cold water pipe... usually just a clamp on style thumb screw valve.
551288,kickingfrog,2011-02-14 03:07:00,8333,Do you have a water softener? Or a big dog with a small bladder?
551296,ColdH20guy,2011-02-14 03:13:00,312,no just a small dog with a big bladder lol
551305,Bernie,2011-02-14 03:27:00,3190,I have a high efficiency gas furnace and when it runs there is a fair amount of water running out of the drain. Enough that it wouldn't take long to make a mess if it wasn't working properly. Perhaps it is clogged up?
551310,ColdH20guy,2011-02-14 03:32:00,312,thanks Bernie..must be somewhere..I just remembered we have a guy in our fishing club (Barrie Bassmasters) that works for a heating/cooling place; will call him in the morning over coffee..  thanks guys
551337,camillj,2011-02-14 05:06:00,1988,"Well .. when my wife called me to SHOW me that our dryer was leaking (I assured her it was IMPOSSIBLE)... I was shocked to find about a half a gallon of water and 20lbs of pine cones in the exhaust pipe - that a little dirty rotten red squirrel had dropped down there each time he was getting into the house through the vent and got stuck getting the pine cone through the little hole he had found his way through in the exhaust hose .... eventually the condensation had waterlogged the pine cones and was dripping back down the hose and escaping under the dryer .... so many things wrong with this - electrocution, fire, who knows how long it had been oging on for ...  Have it checked out ASAP ..."
