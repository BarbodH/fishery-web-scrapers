551681,Governator,2011-02-15 03:19:00,879,"Yup kids do stupid stuff and they learn from it, it's the only way.  We've all had our experiences, too bad in their case it could actually result in death.  I remember climbing to the top of a crab apple tree around that age and started swinging back and forth on the top branch.  It was all fun until the branch broke and I fell through all the little twigs landing on the bottom branch right between the legs.  It was the worst nutshot you could imagine.  At least I've had 1 kid so far so I know that department still works but I learned a lesson or two that day."
551703,Joey,2011-02-15 04:57:00,9122,"I agree he did the right thing, I just don't understand the ""unsupervised 10 year olds"" statement!"
551704,TDunn,2011-02-15 05:10:00,680," wow, that made me laugh! Glad you are ok!  Seen a buddy do the same but on a pine tree....he landed on the ground tho..."
551706,BassAsin,2011-02-15 07:20:00,806,"we all live and learn and play around stuff we shouldnt its a part of growing up, those responses saying we grew up just fine should feel fortunate, i have personally lost a friend in moving water in the winter time and it has changed my ideas on live and learn.  live and learn works only if your alive.  kudos to you manitou i can see if you gave them crap for for something harmless but in this case i'm glad someones looking out for others youngens when a busy parent doesnt have the time."
551710,pikehunter,2011-02-15 11:03:00,1659,"The kids may not have realized the danger, maybe after your introvention they now understand. This is the same as parents allowing todlers to run across a busy store parking lot by themselves where they are too small to see from out the rear window of a car, van or a truck. Parents are probably the type who haven't the foggiest clue or care what the kids are up to as long as they aren't bothering them.  This takes me back to when I was a kid. My father told me to not venture out onto the icebanks that sometimes develop on this end of L. Ont. because of the cracks and instability of the huge chunks of ice. I never did go out onto them. Seen others do it and I cringe."
551727,OhioFisherman,2011-02-15 12:55:00,6623," Lost a cousin years ago, 12-13 year old kids riding their bikes on a frozen river, kids don`t generally think."
551749,bubbles,2011-02-15 15:12:00,591,"Wow, some of these responses are a little ""out there""  I have a nine year old son, he leaves the house, goes out to play with his friends and I'll bet I don't know 1/2 the things he does.  All I can do is hope I have taught him to make good decisions.  If not I hope there are people out there like Manitou to kick him in the ass when he needs it.  Good for you man."
551771,fisher,2011-02-15 17:02:00,451,Exactly Bubbles - I would hope that everyone would react like Manitou did.  When I read the opening post I would never have thought the next few posts would even remotely suggest leaving the kids on their own would have been acceptable.
551774,fisher,2011-02-15 17:08:00,451,http://www.citytv.com/toronto/citynews/news/local/article/106418--family-mourns-7-year-old-who-drowned-in-lake-ontario  Here is a story about a recent tragedy where some kids ventured onto some ice while not appreciating the dangers that were present.  “Everybody in the neighbourhood knew him we all kind of keep an eye out for everybody’s kids and it definitely – it’s a tragedy.”
551312,manitoubass2,2011-02-14 03:43:00,11391,"We had some pretty warm weather today, around +7. So I figured what the heck, it's better than the -41 I went out in 4-5 days ago, lets go do some fishing.  So, I walked down to my normal local spot, and was surprised by a few old friends already down there fishing! Awesome, plus they had holes drilled already, even bigger bonus!  After that I figured it was gonna be a great day for sure, but it wasn't. We managed a few 17"" walleye, nice eaters. It was tough bite, although we know there are tons of fish there. Oh well, thats how it goes sometimes.  Anyhow, after 3 hours my buddies pack up and leave. I decided to stay as the bite usually picks up nice in the evening. It started getting pretty sketchy out there though, being it is a high current river (rainy river). The shack was slowly being engulfed in water. In 3 hours the water arose a good 4 inches, and there was some heavy cracking. So I called a buddy to bring the fourwheeler and a jack down so we could move it and block it up above the water.  While I'm waiting for him, I see two kids walk out on the ice. I'm thinking what the hell? I see two kids, look to be maybe 8-9 years old, with no adult in sight. So I waited a minute, still never noticed any adults. So I start walking towards them shouting for them to get off the ice. They keep going, problem is, there walking right towards the main channel, right at the rapids!!!  I snapped a few picks as I was running towards them, and I actually had to escort them off the ice.  Anyhow, I just thought that was pretty unreal. Shame on their parents.  Then my buddy gets there, we do what we need to do and I mention the kids to him. His reply, ""Yeah, they were down here yesterday as well, unreal hey?""  I'm just baffled, 10 year old kids unsupervised, not 75 yards from open water in the main channel of a flowing river????"
551314,irishfield,2011-02-14 03:50:00,26272,"Good for the kids... our parents never knew where we were from breakfast to supper.. every day of the year while growing up on the fast flowing Rideau. Yah we did some dumb things just like that.. ""hey Wayne.. I dare you to go out and touch the open water"".. but we all survived and learned a few things."
551315,bigugli,2011-02-14 03:56:00,6138,"Kids need to be able to explore on their own. Else they never develop necessary problem solving skills or self confidence. At that age my folks would not have had a clue where I was while romping through forest, field, and ponds."
551316,Joey,2011-02-14 04:03:00,9122,"Not sure what the problem is, we did lots of exploring like that when we were kids.  Better than sitting in front a computer if you ask me.  Give them some credit!!  I'm sure they've been out there before and know the dangers."
551318,ADB,2011-02-14 04:07:00,444,...and if they went through the ice and died?  I guess they would've learned something then.  These kids were 8 or 9.  Not 15 or 16.
551319,manitoubass2,2011-02-14 04:11:00,11391,"I'm all for exploring and such, but kids near open water at the rapids unsupervised is unacceptable IMO.  Would be a great story in the paper the following day, imagine that was your kids.  And I can assure you they had no idea what they were doing in that area, I've never seen these kids in my whole life., and I'm down there a good 150 days a year."
551320,irishfield,2011-02-14 04:11:00,26272,As far as I'm concerned.. you're not a kid at 16... I was in University at 17 and married at 20!
551323,manitoubass2,2011-02-14 04:14:00,11391," lol  But still these kids were no older than 8-9. You go through the ice here, I don't care who you are, your not coming up  I might also add, I dont wish to be there if/when they fall through the ice"
551324,irishfield,2011-02-14 04:19:00,26272,"I hear you manitou... you weren't going to come up in the Rideau either..well you might 2 mile down as you went over the next dam. I lived between the main town locks and Old Sly's.. anyone that knows the area knows the ice was NEVER safe. Yet we played on it, day in .. day out... part of being a kid and learning the hard way. I think we all grew up significantly quicker doing so."
551325,manitoubass2,2011-02-14 04:23:00,11391," I hear ya, I did my fair share of dumb things as well. But I'm in a different mindset as a parent nowadays. Still though, I'd flip my crap if I ever caught my kids down there under the same circumstances, and I've taught them well enough for them to know that.  But like I said, if they go down, I dont wanna be there. Automatically your going to be held accountable on some level, whether its the parents or police. I don't need that, nor do I need the guilty conscience of knowing I never told them to leave"
551327,Joey,2011-02-14 04:29:00,9122,"  I think it is how  you worded it, I understand what you are saying in general, but you can't possibly supervise 10 year olds 24/7 without them being mollycoddled.  They need to learn and grow and explore.  It would definatly be terrible if they went through but you can't supervise them every single minute.  I bet they had no idea that is where their kids were playing, just like my parents had no idea where I was until supper time!"
551328,tb4me,2011-02-14 04:35:00,3295,"x2..  We were at our trailer, this past summer there were young kids jumping off a cliff into shallow water into the river.. My wife freaked out on them. She said to me that she wouldnt be able to live with herself if they had broken thier necks. I now can understand.. even thou she embarrassed the hell out of me...lol"
551343,blizzcat,2011-02-14 07:01:00,92,That's a disturbing story. Kids need to be taught how dangerous it can be!! Good thing you were there to do some parenting which they apparently needed.
551368,I'mHooked,2011-02-14 14:00:00,525,"If you believe in the phrase ""It takes a village..."", then you did your part. Good for you. It's your own conscience you have to spend your time with, so might as well do what you need to to live with yourself. If that includes providing guidance to some kids, you've done the right thing."
551397,perchslayer666,2011-02-14 16:00:00,280,"Ya, you did the right thing, I would have done the same.... Dumb kids don't know any better unless given a dose of reality...which in this case would be certain death.  I understand the ""Back in the day"" talk... But c'mon if we know better now because of the mistakes of others in the past, then why would we encourage this type of risky behavior?  It's one thing to be outside and adventurous, but its also another thing to know your limits, which should be the point here."
551402,brifishrgy,2011-02-14 16:11:00,559,"the kids are probably telling their friends at school about the guys ice fishing on 4"" of water yelling at them to get off the ice then driving a quad onto it to get their hut  kids are kids and need to learn what is safe and what isnt, I hope you explaned to them about currents under the water and what it does to ice because if you didnt they didnt learn a thing"
551413,POLLIWOGG,2011-02-14 16:29:00,835,Should have got them to help you move your hut.
551431,manitoubass2,2011-02-14 16:48:00,11391," haha, thats alright, at least there alive to tell the story.  If I was staying any longer myself, they would have been more than welcome to fish with me.  and I would never be caught on 4"" of ice, nevermind with a four wheeler"
551432,mbac31,2011-02-14 16:48:00,904," Yes , but thats when Dinosaurs walked wasnt it."
551449,ranksda58,2011-02-14 17:14:00,69,"we were all that age and we've all done some things we now know we shouldnt have...if my mom knew some of the things i did growing up i still wouldnt be allowed out of the house lol  with that being said, i would've done the same as you though...being a new father myself i cant imagine losing my son in that way and id be more than happy if a stranger told them it was dangerous to be out there"
551606,strik,2011-02-15 00:09:00,175,way to go  Kids will be kids Have to learn the hard way..  Years ago a older guy seen my friends and i  were playing and swimming  the the local dam  he not only talked to us the also taked to my father after that we stayed clear but that month there was two boys that were not so lucky.  To bad that guy was not out for a walk that day.  No dought kids will be kids BUT if we see them doing something stupid should we not say something  someday it might be your kid or grandchild a stranger saves without even knowing it.  Good to here everyone was safe  Best of luck to all Strik
551611,solopaddler,2011-02-15 00:33:00,8605,"    Exactly.  I can't believe some of the responses here.  I don't hover over my kids and mollycoddle them, neither does my wife. They get plenty of freedom.  If one or both of them happened to wander onto dangerous ice like that, near flowing water no less, I can only hope someone like Manitou would be there to stop them.  So I guess it's safe to say that those of you who didn't see anything wrong with the kids doing that, would have said and done nothing if in Manitou's place?  Good for you Manitou, you might have saved a kids life."
551627,buckster,2011-02-15 01:09:00,530,I have to agree with solo...  I cant believe these responses i've read!
551636,crappieperchhunter,2011-02-15 01:24:00,2582,Nothing wrong with letting kids out on there own. I feel sorry for city kids who never get the chance to roam free in the great outdoors like I did as a youngster.  However I would like to think that in a similar situation I would have been right there like Manitoubass2 was to show some guidance.  Good on you for stepping up to make sure they where safe  I'm pretty sure reading about something terrible in the paper the next day would be something we all would not want.
551641,Rustic-Fisher,2011-02-15 01:33:00,826,"Good for you, may of saved a life. Kids will be kids but you did the right thing! Irishfield????? and others who see nothing wrong with this, Give your heads a shake!!!!  :wallbash:  Oh by the way, I am the one that goes for a swim to get you out when you go through!!, so I guess I have some street credentials LOL..  Training pic from last week!"
