551219,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-02-13 23:57:00,0,went to my camp the first time this winter yesterday and today.  there was about 2 ft of undisturbed powder and some VERY slushy lakes.  i think at final count i got the 700 stuck 8 times.  thankfully my chums were there to help me out!  nice to hear that there is still some chivalry on our waters.

551417,Dara,2011-02-14 16:32:00,3052,  That little lever that makes the engine sound louder....you gotta squeeze that harder when you get near slush.  what have you got on that for a track?
551428,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-02-14 16:42:00,0, i've got a 136...  but it's pretty hard to get stuck when you spend all your time riding around on groomed trails.  i only got stuck in slush once because i had to slow down when my chums 440 in front of me started to bog down.  the 25 other times i got stuck was in a few feet of powder on my families property.  goo' times!
551597,Dara,2011-02-14 23:48:00,3052,"  how deep a 136?  My venture had 136 with a 3/4 lug. The Rage has 1 -1 quarter lugs...what a difference.  and why does this do that....all of a sudden I can`t get a fraction bar, its french accents instead   slush is brutal though. A friend went to tilleys alone and got stuck, then when he was coming out a couple twits left a sled stuck on the trail...another hour and a half to get that out of the way and around it"
