551252,Whitespinnerbait,2011-02-14 01:14:00,2038,  That makes two of us........  I`ll be heading to Ste-Marie next saturday for the morning bite............Moving up to 31 Mile Lake for some whities and OOS Lakers .  Your more than welcome to join   Nice eyes BTW
551258,Leecher,2011-02-14 01:41:00,7832, Thanks Paul!!!  Them eyes were on the flat yesterday (10' - 12' fow) and the bite was very short.  Caught them back to back  Would be happy to join you next Saturday... I still have a few salties in the freezer  Let me know the details
551311,Leecher,2011-02-14 03:36:00,7832," I totally agree with what you are saying for the evening bite  I think when the sun is setting on the horizon is the best time for eyes but the area I'm fishing is a big weedy flat, about 10' to 12' fow and think walleyes come to feed in the morning but leave to other grounds in the afternoon or when the sun is setting  I could be wrong but this is what I've noticed so far and will target them in the morning for that fact   Got to love when they come out to play"

550892,Leecher,2011-02-12 23:52:00,7832,"I've been on the hunt for eyes the past couple of weeks without any success... but today it sure was another story.... the window of opportunity opened for a very short time this morning and I was there, ready for it  I went 2 for 3, with a decent 17 3/4"" and caught another 17""er... I just couldn't be any happier  Last night I was prepping the gear and the weather man was calling for some snow overnight and heavy winds.... didn't think much of it at that time and went to bed early....  Got about 6 hours of sleep, woke up around 4:00am and look outside     Man, snow was fallen really hard and thick   I was having second thoughts  But 5:30am came around and I got up, got the gear out to the car and the way I go    The drive up was somewhat kind of slow, couldn't see the road much, it was all white, so I limit the speed to 60Km/H  A long ride to say the least but got there before sunrise  Once I had the gear setup, wasn't long before the bite started but no takers at this point     It was snowing pretty steady then and was anxious    The first fish to make it's way onto the ice was a 10""  perch on the set line, which I thought I could update Team 8 but it went back down the hole  I was thinking at that point, that it was going to be a perch outing.... Once the wind blew the heavy clouds and the sun came out,  I get a good hit on my jigging rod, setup with a Mr. Champ type spoon, tipped with a Gulp fish fry.... another specie to make the board for Team 8    Not long after I get another nice wally on my tipup... this time on a salty    Was I ever happy to see this    I miss one on a tipup that got my minnow when I set the hook  At around noonish I packed up and went home..... bite had turned off    the drive was much faster with the roads cleared  Made a little video for your peruse... it's got additional pics and some bloopers    Enjoy!!!  ps.

550918,highdrifter,2011-02-13 00:47:00,2534,"Well done Jacques!  Aren't you glad you weren't frazzled by a little snow?!?!  Aye, vlimeuse de belle tuque..  C'est ti du castor?!"

550927,Terry,2011-02-13 01:01:00,14456,nice fish nice video  when you gonna add underwater videos too....

550937,asdve23rveavwa,2011-02-13 01:10:00,2690,"Nice Jacques  Haven't checked, did you enter those for team 8?"
550940,Leecher,2011-02-13 01:14:00,7832, Thanks Frankie!!!  Sure did
550949,Joey,2011-02-13 01:42:00,9122,"Great report, pics and video Jacques.  Well done.  Great music too, I love Disturbed"
550961,Leecher,2011-02-13 02:01:00,7832, Thanks Joey!!!  Disturbed has got great tunes for making videos that I love  They blend perfectly
550962,Grimace,2011-02-13 02:04:00,2020,Well done.  I like the long ice scoop so you can clean the holes standing up straight.
550964,Grimace,2011-02-13 02:05:00,2020,Looks like it scopes in for transport.  Excellent.
550965,bigugli,2011-02-13 02:05:00,6138,What's a little weather when the fish are calling. Nice walters.
550974,Leecher,2011-02-13 02:17:00,7832," Thanks Grimace!!!  Yeah that ice scoop is a thing of beauty   telescopic and made for 6"" augers    Fits nicely in a 5 gallon bucket when retracted    Thanks Bruce!!!"
550987,mercman,2011-02-13 02:49:00,7054,WTG Jacques  Nice specimen. Love your vids.Well made and entertaining.Thanks my friend  Paul
550992,Leecher,2011-02-13 02:56:00,7832, Thanks Paul!!!  I was quite happy to get those specimens and one of them really caught me by surprise on the jigging rod  The vid part is what I love doing.... glad you enjoyed it
551080,ranksda58,2011-02-13 14:41:00,69,"awesome wallies, loved the vid!"
551092,archie_james_c,2011-02-13 15:23:00,618,Nice eyes man! I too have been hunting for them since early January and only have 2 eyes to show  . Have you tried the evening bite at your lake instead of the morning bite?
551093,Cudz,2011-02-13 15:30:00,2652,nice eyes.  dinner!
551095,Grimace,2011-02-13 15:36:00,2020,"  I for one have always been a big fan of the evening bite over the morning bite. I still fish both as I am well aware of the benefits of the morning bite.  I just love fishing as the sun goes down and I visualize as it gets darker how the world comes into focus for the walleye.  In the morning it seems I am in a rush to catch fish as the bite wanes, but in the evening it is just heating up."
551102,GBW,2011-02-13 15:46:00,8460,nice shooting bud!
551109,Rod Caster,2011-02-13 16:01:00,5784,nice dark colours on those bad boyz!  Salty eh? hmmm..never tried them. Are they homemade?
551118,GBW,2011-02-13 16:25:00,8460,It's a French secret...      I'll tell ya only because you are on team 8
551130,archie_james_c,2011-02-13 17:12:00,618,I 100% agree with you on that as far as my spring/summer fishing has proved. Also...I like the idea of sleeping in and then lolligagging my way to the lake for the evening bite
551185,Leecher,2011-02-13 21:51:00,7832, Thanks ranksda58!!!   Thanks archie_james_c!!!  I've tried it a few times and did not get any.... only seemed to catch them early morning for some unknown reason   Thanks Chris!!!  You bet   Thanks Mon Ca-pi-ten!!!
551191,Leecher,2011-02-13 22:00:00,7832," Thanks Rod Caster!!!  Salties are very easy to make... any left over minnows you have when coming back home from fishing, lay them on a piece of wax paper, generously pour pickling salt (corse) on them so that you cover them, fold the paper so as to not loose any salt and put it into a zip lock freezer type bag and into the freezer  I do this since up here I cannot use live bait, only dead / frozen minnows    The salt will harden them nicely and they won't be mush when they thaw"
