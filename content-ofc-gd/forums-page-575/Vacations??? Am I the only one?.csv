Best $45 I ever spent!!!!!! a four or five hour cruise with swimming, dancing and a steak dinner with all the drinks you could handle to wash 'er all down with. Been on that thing about 1/2 dozen times!!!!   All you can drink rum swizzles served in 1 gallon jugs"
551593,Billy Bob,2011-02-14 23:31:00,5865, Around 1992 I took my 2 boys and wife to Disney for the first time....went back the next year and again was amazed how well run this HUGE business was run....invested 5K when we got home and about 4 or 5 years later sold it after a 3 for 1 split and purchased a nice 20K+ coupe.....my son still drives it...since then we have been back about half a dozen times with last year being the most recent.  But life is about variety for me and the wife....errrrrr....that was until she discovered VEGAS and Black Jack....so we will be spending a few days again here....  BTW I also HATE the beach.....dirty sand everywhere....
551599,Rich,2011-02-14 23:56:00,3927,"Dude, I just took a week's vacation time to ice fish. LOL I totally hear ya! Yeah, prepare for months on end, spend a ton of cash so you can fly somewhere, spend more cash and drink a lot on a beach. I'd rather spend a little more on fishing for a week and come home and get drunk every night for 1/80th the price LOL"
551626,DRIFTER_016,2011-02-15 01:08:00,10439,"For what it costs to go to some of these island destinations for a week I can go to Alaska for 5 weeks and stay in my camper and chase trout and salmon every day!!!    There are beautiful beaches to hang out on.    And beautiful turqoise waters just like the islands too.    HMMMMMMMM, a week on some beach in a third world country or........................"
551711,Billy Bob,2011-02-15 11:07:00,5865,"DRIFTER I like the way you think.......Alaska was in the cards for us this year but then we had to fold when our youngest told us he's getting married in July.....  ...Oh, well there always next year..."
551736,lookinforwalleye,2011-02-15 13:50:00,4399, The wife and I were on that beach and in that shop a few weeks ago Wayne and yes it was busy but the beer was cheap as I recall 1.50
551756,JohnF,2011-02-15 15:54:00,3494,"I think we sometimes forget that marriage is a partnership. It's not just about what suits us personally.  The first time we were invited to go on a holiday in Mexico it was about the last thing I wanted to do, but I knew my wife really wanted it, so I sucked it up and agreed.  The first few days were every bit as boring as I figured, although I discovered there a lot of topless sunbathers just down the beach. That brightened the day somewhat. Then I realized the food was excellent - another bonus. But I was still bored sitting by the pool every day. I started to wander around the pools and the beach meeting new friends, some of whom remain good friends 15 years later, folks from all over Canada and the US. This was getting better all the time.  So I started looking at my other options. There were tours to be had very reasonably priced. I've always thought guided tours were kinda tacky but it turned out that there were lots of fascinating things to be seen not far from Cancun. There is a huge amount of Maya culture to be seen, from pyramids to entire cities that have been lost in the jungle for years but have only recently been unearthed. Coba is one of the newest locations to be made accessible and it's incredible. Unfortunately the pyramid at Chichen Itza can no longer be climbed but the one at Coba is open. It's about 300' high and a very steep climb. Not for the faint of heart.  Then one day I participated in a swimming pool dive experience, free, just to put on the gear and paddle around the bottom of a 5' pool. Too cool. And that led to a 3 hour resort course and an easy dive in 30' of water on a gorgeous bit of reef absolutely covered in exotic fishies and a whole bunch of Southern Sting Rays. We even saw a Nurse shark in the distance. This turned into a 10 year obsession for me including diving the Yucatan cenotes at least a few days on every holiday. Cenotes are caves btw. And they're beautiful. Intimidating at first but once you learn to do it right (i.e. with extreme care) it's amazing. This one little adventure led to me meeting folks and diving with them all over the Great Lakes, but even better, the Florida Keys and up the east Florida coast. To learn to dive safely and well I made a number of trips to quarried in Pennsylvania (Dutch Springs) and Ohio (Gilboa). The Gilboa trips became more of a gathering of friends than dive training.  So don't be afraid to share your holiday time with your spouse. It turned out that I had more fun in Cancun than my wife ever did just because I put a little effort into it. And she still thinks I do it for her.  JF"
551776,solopaddler,2011-02-15 17:43:00,8605,"Or....  Send your wife on a tropical trip with her sisters, then book four fly in trips for the softwater season.   Works for me."
551829,Governator,2011-02-15 21:15:00,879," Some very good points there John, thanks.  We have an 18 month old, I'm just plain scared to travel far distances right now.  My wife and I have had mini vacations by dropping off the kid at one of our parents and hit a hotel for a couple nights.  Those are fun getaways for us. We hit the movies,  pool, have a nice dinner and go for a walk. It's worth a few hundred bucks to get that much needed break in together."
551836,crappieperchhunter,2011-02-15 21:28:00,2582, Loved those weekenders with Debbe when the kids where small. Some of my best holiday memories...and we where never more then 5 hours away from home.
551860,camillj,2011-02-15 22:34:00,1988,First time I went to Cancun (about 30 years ago)... it actually WAS a fishing trip .. we drove up the coast about an hour went out for the day in a 'punta' and caught lots of 5' barracuda with a local who took us out for the day for about $50  I agree though beaches aint my thing ... unless there is coral .. then I love to snorkel ...its almost like fishin except you can see them but cant really catch them (now that spear fishin is all frowned upon and all)
552065,jedimaster,2011-02-16 10:22:00,3472,Well i gave in I told her I would go as long as she doesnt ask me to hang out at the beach and I can go golfing and fishing on her beach days
551168,solopaddler,2011-02-13 20:59:00,8605,  Probably not Gerritt.  But maybe a Portoguese Man?      (Ice fishing is popular among the Portoguese.  )
551173,Gerritt,2011-02-13 21:15:00,6129,"LOL Mike, indeed it is! I took that shot while walking the beach on my way to the market...(where they gouge tourists like me!)  I love the Dominican, the culture, the lifestyle and of course the fishing!  That said, it makes me appreciate what we have here in Canada"
551174,mercman,2011-02-13 21:20:00,7054, Thats it......Never quite thought about THAT before..... Now i cant stop YUCK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
551200,express168,2011-02-13 22:21:00,327,"Did the whole Disney thing 2 years ago, all the parks got the daughter all done up at Cinderellas castle etc. Expensive but very enjoyable with the kids and wife. Done Aruba , Cuba, Mexico, Portugal, Spain, don't just sit on the beach we rent jeeps on hit the roads, horseback riding in the mountains, deep sea fishing, bass fishing and a little scuba and snorkelling. Very enjoyable, to just lie there I might as well stay on the couch. This year it looks like a family trip in the summer up towards Gogama, got to change it up and I want the kids to appreciate the outdoor activities available to us here in Ontario."

551218,SlowPoke,2011-02-13 23:56:00,2984," This is exactly how I feel. Even if it was a free trip, I'd be roaming around looking for something else to do!"
551220,danbouck,2011-02-14 00:00:00,4380,"I haven't even thought about going anywhere for that amount of money to just sit on a beach. I find it a much better time pulling into a campsite, hiking,fishing and just enjoying the outdoors.  Mind you I have been extremely lucky to have a family cottage on the beach"
551221,irishfield,2011-02-14 00:01:00,26272,I don't know... I could get on a jet tomorrow..  
551231,Bernie,2011-02-14 00:30:00,3190," Actually Mike, I rarely buy toys. And if I do it's because I use them and they are rarely new ones. I like to spend it here.  The boathouse I rebuilt, the bunkie on the right was rebuilt and the cottage has had several upgrades. Last summer I built the stone sidewalk, and a few other items. Just depends on what you like to do I guess. Do I live in a bubble? No, I don't think I do. I have traveled, just don't care for it."
551239,lookinforwalleye,2011-02-14 00:48:00,4399,"nothing wrong with traveling to other countries and certainly no harm in laying on the beach for a week or so!!!  In 2013 we are planning a trip that will include Italy,Greece and Egypt there is more to life than fishing!"
551247,lookinforwalleye,2011-02-14 00:59:00,4399,"  Well said Mike the wife and I made a decision a few years ago to start to travel more and while she certainly does more travel than I I am starting to get the bug more and more, I can`t wait to see the Sistine Chapel,the Vatican and the Pyramids and so much more in a couple of years.  Can`t wait to see Richter lake either!!!"

551371,davew3,2011-02-14 14:26:00,430,"Personally you have to try both.  Last summer was up at Ivanhoe river during the hot spell, 3 weeks ago on the ice at BOQ - 20, and in two weeks will be in the Grand Caymens and Cozumal.  Been to 4 islands down south and I also cannot just sit around.  To see and learn thier culture is a life experience.  Especially when the white stuff is still here on the gound.  Irishfield, St Martin rocks !!"
551373,Governator,2011-02-14 14:31:00,879,"When we go on vacation it always feels like there's a plan, there's something we have to do, etc.  It's just not as relaxing as I always hope and before you know the trip is over, wallet is empty and your boarding the plane on a dreadful Sunday knowing you're back to work the next day.  I just like being secluded more, up north, fishing & going at my own pace.  Every trip seems different, often an adventure with real stories that isn't about how you lost your luggage but how the ""Big one got away"".  Sure sippin' cocktails on the beach is good times, but definitely not something I enjoy doing every year.   My wife on the other hand would have a different story...."
551401,skeeter,2011-02-14 16:09:00,1907,"Friends of ours go on vacations ALL the time. For years they kept bugging the wife and i to go with them. I felt the same way most of the people here replied. The grass is green, the sky is blue,we have that here too. So the answer was NO! Well that was until Pete told me that the beach, that the resort was on was TOPLESS! When do we leave?????????  Spent a week in the Dominican,on the beach,horse back riding, on the beach,kayaking, on the beach. Did i mention the beach was TOPLESS?  I would love to post the pictures here but i think Roy would kick my butt so hard that i would have to take off my shirt to poop. "

551418,sconceptor,2011-02-14 16:34:00,146,"I always thought I would never enjoy trips down south.  I've always enjoyed fishing trips up north, and got a group of friends to go up for 6years in a row.  We usually go to remote Quebec, and spend better parts of 1grand each for the whole week(cabin&boat 500-600$/gas 20$/travel 80-100$/gear some spend hundreds some spend 50$ /food 60-80$steaksx3/smoked chops,burgers sausages/beer 100-200$).  Finally went south for a friends wedding(missed one a few years earlier as I spent my money of fishing).  This year, my wife and I did our honeymoon in Mexico during the summer.  For the 1000-1500$ to fly to a tropical resort is great.  The all you can drink and eat is fantastic.  They are so relaxing and the excursions are fun!  Hate the shopping down south!  I regret missing out on the one wedding, and am planning for more trips south over the next few years.   I just need budget them in with a yearly 1 grand fishing trip too!  Fished in Mexico but didn't catch anything.  Rained most of the week in Dominican so we didn't fish.  One of these years it'd be nice to catch a baracuda, maui maui, or sail fish!!!!"
551419,irishfield,2011-02-14 16:34:00,26272, Yes Gerry.. the Sunset on Jan 20th    ..but any store will do..    Marteen has become a tad too busy.. we hadn't been there since '91 and I don't think we'll be back.
551421,Carp,2011-02-14 16:36:00,1488,"I have no desire to sit on a beach for a week, let alone have to pay thousands of dollars for it. Last time I did it was on my honeymoon 15 years ago. I wanted to go to Banff, she wanted the Caribbean. I ended up in Barbados for a week. Damn !!!  Spent as little time as I could on the beach. I managed to go out on a fishing charter one morning, but the fishing was terrible. Ocean was very rough that day. Only 1 Wahoo among 4 anglers. Did some snorkeling at the resort and walking around the area. The food at the resort was great. Arrived home 10 to 12 pounds heavier. Still haven't lost it.  I've lived in Canada for all my life and have only seen a fraction of this beautiful country. Looking forward to visiting both the east and west coasts at some point and doing some fishing, hunting and sightseeing. Lots to see in-between too."
551446,Fish4Eyes,2011-02-14 17:10:00,1022,"My girlfriend and friends think im sick in the head for choosing up north over a tropical vacation. It is assuring to know that im not the only one  . Although, I did give in this year as were planning a trip for April."
551451,solopaddler,2011-02-14 17:18:00,8605,"  Compromise.  Personally I like the idea of doing it all.  Our honeymoon we spent a week in Cuba, were back home for 2 days, then we headed north for a 1 week fly in trip."
551454,Gerritt,2011-02-14 17:22:00,6129,  dude Pm me! we will own the DR! lol
551480,DRIFTER_016,2011-02-14 18:36:00,10439," I vacationed in Barbados a couple of times. About a 15 minute walk from my hotel was a brackish swamp full of tilapia and tarpon!!! When I wasn't there I was casting off the beach and when I got thirsty I would amble up to the bar for a rum cooler.  Did you manage a trip on the Jolly Roger while you were there? Best $45 I ever spent!!!!!! a four or five hour cruise with swimming, dancing and a steak dinner with all the drinks you could handle to wash 'er all down with. Been on that thing about 1/2 dozen times!!!!"
551483,cityfisher,2011-02-14 18:53:00,959,"I like both, mid winter when im sick of the hassle of ice fishing, nothings better than sitting BY THE BEACH BOYYYY in jamaica....awesome ! and i get to go fishing too... sounds good to me... during the summer months, id rather be on the lake !"
551086,jedimaster,2011-02-13 15:03:00,3472,"Am I the only one that dreads the though of spending 2000 dollars to sit at a beach for a week? I really have no interest in goin to a beach. I don't even like going to beaches here let alone flying 5000 miles to go to one for an entire week.  I would rather go fishing for a week or sit at home an tinke on the boat or the jeep, or buy a bunch of new fishing rods...  Anyway I think I am in a losing battle here... Just thought I would rant.  Ps the leafs suck"
551088,SBCregal,2011-02-13 15:09:00,688,"i think the exact same way.  i have a buddy at work who spends thousands and thousands to go to disney twice a year, he wouldnt THINK of heading north for something relaxing.  hell, the guy has never been north of barrie and can say ""theres much more to see at disney than northern ontario""  i have no idea how he can do the same thing over and over and over."
551089,2advanced,2011-02-13 15:09:00,53,Thats why you make the best of it and go fishing while on vacation.  Wake up early in the morning! Awesome fishing in Aruba on shore
551090,mercman,2011-02-13 15:10:00,7054,"Yes they suck, but no worse than our Habs. Bring the rod and reel and do sone fishin on the beach  "
551094,crappieperchhunter,2011-02-13 15:34:00,2582,Well I don't get it either. We have a very small little cottage in Bobcaygeon and I am Happy as a clam there and for 7 months of the year we go pretty much every weekend.  But Debbe has the travel bug and her passport and we have the means to travel so she really wants me to have the travel bug too. The desire is just not there for me. She just did a trip to Jamaica with one of her girlfriends...her 2nd girls trip without me in 27 years. She had a great time...but when she did a slideshow of her trip and we sat down and viewed them together...she would say...this was fun...but I'm not sure you would have enjoyed it...and OH and this was fun..but I'm not sure you would have enjoyed that either. After 30plus years of knowing each other she knows that I'm really not wired for a trip like that.  We have an agreement. She can take one of her friends and go on a nice trip every 3 years. I have done my Fly in Fishing trips with the boys and she will do her southern sun holidays with the girls. We will see how that works out.  But she has a passport application on the dresser for me to fill out......
551099,bigugli,2011-02-13 15:40:00,6138," I admit to being a Disney junkie. The place is ever evolving, so things are always changing. Bass fishing there and through the area is also good.  Once every 3-4 years is good enough though. Lying around the beach just tain't me. I need to be doing, and there is a lot of Canada still to do."
551103,DRIFTER_016,2011-02-13 15:48:00,10439,"You're doing it wrong if you don't like vacations. I base my vacations around fishing. whether it be up North, back East, in Alaska or somewhere tropical it's all about the fishing. I may take a day or two to chill and drink rum coolers on the beach when fishing tropical though."
551105,crappieperchhunter,2011-02-13 15:54:00,2582, I have thought about that approach for a tropical vacation with Debbe. But I am contend with the fishing I have here. So I see no need to spent extra $$$ to get special gear and licences etc etc to fish for a few hours here and there on a one week trip.
551106,solopaddler,2011-02-13 15:56:00,8605,I'd love to be lying on a beach right about now.
551107,Grimace,2011-02-13 15:56:00,2020,"My better half has a strong dislike for the sun and heat as I do.  She likes to come with me when I rent cabins.  Problem is this, she loathes camping and I have a love for it. I want to start doing a fair deal of camping as my boy is almost two.  Looks like I might have to wait a few years until he is old enough so I can take him myself.  Oh well at least she does not want to drag me to the carribean to sit in people's pee at the swim up bar."
551110,irishfield,2011-02-13 16:05:00,26272,They can lie on the beach all they want Jedi... it gives you something to stare at everytime on the back cast...  
551112,JohnF,2011-02-13 16:08:00,3494," Me too. I'm like a little kid down there. Unfortunately we've gotten out of that mode since we've been going to Cancun every January. I'm hoping that our new grandson who's due any day now will be my excuse for some more trips back to Mickey Land. I even enjoy the drive down there. Not so much the drive home.  And you're right. It's smack in the middle of great bass fishing country. In fact it seems to me a member here wrote about hiring a guide and doing some fishing there a few years back.  Sure, it's tacky and cheesy and expensive, but dayum - it's fun.  JF"

However, while she lays on the beach, I take a Boston Whaler out and catch bonita, spanish mackeral, and barracuda. A couple of times during the trip she will let me go down to the dock at night and cast a fly rod for tarpon (had 7 hookups last year, but only one landed).  Also, this trip buys me at least two trips to the French River.  Is it worth it......heck yeah!!"

I just shake my head , especially when they talk about their 40 and 50 year mortgage..  Nothing like spending 350k on a house you owe 150k for in 15 years, let alone 40-50 years I can see you spending 2k or 4k a year if you have paid off your house and maybe already own a cottage?  I'd rather pay down the mortgage or if it was paid I would rather my own property to relax on the beach. At the very least the money would still be there in 20 years in equity.  Last , many places I'd rather see and do here in CANADA , never seen the mountains in bc the west or east coast, let alone the northern lights in north west territories  the list goes on and on.."

551141,bigugli,2011-02-13 17:49:00,6138,You can fish a lot of the ponds around the hotels. The city of Orlando stocks over 20 lakes within the city itself with public access. Walk out the hotel door and throw some baits while the Mrs sleeps in. Pretty neat having the lake to myself and my own cheering section.
551142,solopaddler,2011-02-13 17:51:00,8605," Beach, up north somewhere, whatever.  I've always been of the opinion, if you're going to spend money, spend it on travel. Waaay better than spending it on toys.  Too many people never get to experience anything, and not 'cause they can't afford it.  They live in a bubble, Eat, work, sleep, and pretty soon they're dead and have done nothing."
