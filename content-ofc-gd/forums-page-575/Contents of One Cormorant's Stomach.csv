552224,Jonny,2011-02-16 20:15:00,1380,"I suppose the full impact doesn't hit someone who hasn't seen what I've seen. Looking out at the lake, where once I would see the odd gull or small flock of gulls, I can now see thousands of cormorants in a feeding frenzy.  They fly in and land in cloud after cloud, covering the surface of the water, constantly diving and bobbing up. The huge flock moves down the bay, with the ones at the front diving, and the ones at the rear flying up and leapfrogging to the front before diving again. The scene is one of frenetic activity as they work their way a couple of miles down the bay, never ceasing their progress for a moment.  They are diving in 15 to 20 feet of water. They can dive to 30+ feet and when they are churning up the bay in their thousands I guess they're catching the odd fish.  But it's OK. I don't have a scientific study to tell me that they're impacting the fish population, and the MNR doesn't seem to be  in a hurry to provide one, so I think if I just sort of chill, everything will work out in the end.

In many instances anglers can serve as the ""canary in the coalmine"" for the resource because they have intimate knowledge of their home waters.  At the same time, I'm not willing to start laying waste to a species based on anecdotal evidence alone."
551930,Jonny,2011-02-16 00:42:00,1380,"Quotes from:   The Rise of the Double-crested Cormorant on the Great Lakes: Winning the War Against Contaminants Environment Canada http://www.on.ec.gc....rmorants-e.html My comments in bold type. If the current rate of population growth continues, the Great Lakes cormorant population would increase to more than three-quarters of a million birds by the year 2000. However, this is unlikely to occur. Most animals which colonize new areas show a period of initial, unrestricted growth, just as we have seen with cormorants over the last 10-15 years. Such growth, however, can not be sustained forever.Eventually, the population outstrips its food supply, outgrows its habitat (or nesting areas), or is reduced by disease or predation. When this happens, the cormorant population can be expected to drop in numbers, until it stabilizes itself again.  Cormorants sure aren't going to outgrow their habitat (nesting areas), not with all the thousands of islands that they have to choose from.  Predation – like what, for example?  Disease, yeah, let's wait to see if that happens in populations which have lots of room to spread out.  Outstrip the food supply? Now there's a comforting thought. How much of the food pyramid will be left?  According to fisheries biologists,stocks of the smaller prey fish have been decreasing dramatically in recent years. This decrease in the cormorants' food supply is probably already contributing to their decline on Lake Ontario.  Um, so does that mean that cormorants are the reason for the decline, and that is leading to their own decline? No consolation for the lost resources and environment.  The third concern is not such a clear issue. In northern Georgian Bay, fish harvesters feel that recent declines in local catches of yellow perch and smallmouth bass are the result of increased cormorant numbers at nearby colonies. As evidence they cite the ease with which a ""meal"" of fish was caught ten years ago, before the birds increased. Now, those fish are scarce and good catches are exceedingly rare. They also state that before cormorant numbers increased one could easily observe, when SCUBA diving, large and frequent schools of perch. These schools, too, have now disappeared.  Fish and wildlife officials do not currently have sufficient data to properly evaluate this problem. It is true that cormorant numbers have increased in northern Georgian Bay during the last decade. Cormorants do eat yellow perch and bass,and if these species were locally abundant, they could form the major part of their diet. The Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources and the Michigan Department of Natural Resources, with input from Environment Canada, are now undertaking a major study of the feeding habits of cormorants in Lake Huron in order to shed more light on this question.  They really only need one piece of data. If the quota-controlled commercial catches were stable before the cormorants burst upon the scene, then 2+2 wouldn't be too hard.  There is also concern about the effect of cormorants on the vegetation in their nesting grounds. Cormorants can damage vegetation by stripping leaves from trees. The combined weight of the birds and their nests can even break branches. But perhaps most importantly, their excrement, which rains down to the ground from their nests, kills the ground vegetation and eventually kills the nest tree. In some cases, the loss of these trees can lead to increased erosion. This is of particular concern on sand spits and barrier beaches which protect interior wetlands. In other areas, the vegetation may be of unusual natural significance, such as the islands in western Lake Erie which are forested by rare stands of Carolinian woodlands. The large cormorant colonies there could seriously impact or even destroy this vegetation. So there's concern about rare stands of woodlands. I'd like there to be concern about ALL stands of woodlands, especially on islands.  My wife and I travelled through the northern States a couple of years ago. We stopped for gas at a town in North Dakota. The town was built around a nice lake, maybe an 80 to 100 acre lake, and in the middle of the lake was an island that I guess would have been beautiful at one time. All the island had on it was skeletons of trees, with cormorants perched on top. That's what those townsfolk got for not doing anything – an eyesore that will probably still be like that when their kids are grown."

551975,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-02-16 01:52:00,0,"  The expression anecdotal evidence has two distinct meanings. (1) Evidence in the form of an anecdote or hearsay is called anecdotal if there is doubt about its veracity; the evidence itself is considered untrustworthy.  (2) Evidence, which may itself be true and verifiable, used to deduce a conclusion which does not follow from it, usually by generalizing from an insufficient amount of evidence. For example ""my grandfather smoked like a chimney and died healthy in a car crash at the age of 99"" does not disprove the proposition that ""smoking markedly increases the probability of cancer and heart disease at a relatively early age"". In this case, the evidence may itself be true, but does not warrant the conclusion.  In both cases the conclusion is unreliable; it may not be untrue, but it doesn't follow from the ""evidence"".  Evidence can be anecdotal in both senses: ""Goat yogurt prolongs life: I heard that a man in a mountain village who ate only yogurt lived to 120."" The term is often used in contrast to scientific evidence, such as evidence-based medicine, which are types of formal accounts. Some anecdotal evidence does not qualify as scientific evidence because its nature prevents it from being investigated using the scientific method. Misuse of anecdotal evidence is a logical fallacy and is sometimes informally referred to as the ""person who"" fallacy (""I know a person who...""; ""I know of a case where..."" etc. Compare with hasty generalization). Anecdotal evidence is not necessarily representative of a ""typical"" experience; statistical evidence can more accurately determine how typical something is.  Accounts of direct personal experience are commonly equated to anecdotal evidence where this form of evidence is not one of the above categories of anecdote, hearsay or conclusion deduced from generalisation. Unlike anecdotal evidence the reliability of accounts of personal experience is normally capable of assessment for legal proceedings. When used in advertising or promotion of a product, service, or idea, anecdotal reports are often called a testimonial, which are banned in some jurisdictions.[citation needed] The term is also sometimes used in a legal context to describe certain kinds of testimony. Psychologists have found that people are more likely to remember notable examples than typical examples.[1]"

551983,blarg,2011-02-16 02:03:00,289," Bird eats fish, more birds eat more fish, we care more about fish than bird, bird not endangered by any measurement, reducing bird population eases pressure on fish, bird still thriving.  Your post is meaningless, we aren't going to cull ourselves (you first?..didn't think so), like all other animals our own desires trump those of others, the wolf doesn't ask himself if the Caribou population is solid before he makes a kill, your attitude smacks of P3TA, with attitudes like that reasonable debate is impossible.  It's a darn good thing the spring bear hunt was canceled, after all those bears were nearly extinct..  There is nothing extreme about this debate, or at least there shouldn't be, you know there are people who think plants have just as much right to life as we do, should we stop cutting down trees? I mean who is to say they aren't right, lets get real people, it's a bird.  Anyone eat a chicken lately?"
551985,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-02-16 02:10:00,0,"the ironic part of mentioning the spring bear hunt  is that the issues are more similar than you realize.  the spring bear hunt was cancelled when the government bowed to public pressure, even though there was no scientific basis behind the move.  sounds suspiciously familiar to the control/cull lobby.  i'm all for the reinstatement of the spring bear hunt but that's a totally different can of beans.  if people start eating cormorants, i'm all for having a season!  it's culling the population because of knee jerk politics that bugs me.  is that P3TA enough for you?"
551988,Gregoire,2011-02-16 02:13:00,1397," The exchange of ideas and debate is not meaningless.

Only an unreasonable person would argue that it is not worth debating someone whose ideas are different than their own."

551997,Jonny,2011-02-16 02:24:00,1380," Look, I've fished dozens of lakes where there are healthy populations of seagulls, and your assertion is not correct. That's as mildly as I can put it.  Seagulls nest on barren rock. They don't nest in trees and they hardly even nest on the ground in wooded areas. They like open sky above them when they're nesting, so they pick barren or open areas to begin with. The small islets where you see large numbers of nesting gulls never had much vegetation on them anyway, if any at all. And almost certainly no trees.   "
552003,danc,2011-02-16 02:33:00,4677, Look. I've seen plenty of tree skeletons on islands where seagulls nest. That's as mildly as I can put it.
552010,Jonny,2011-02-16 02:49:00,1380," Not because of sea gulls you haven't.  Why do people notice where cormorants nest? Because they've never seen anything like it where seagullls nest. If we were used to seeing skeleton trees because of seagulls, it wouldn't be such a big issue with cormorants.   "
552015,danc,2011-02-16 03:03:00,4677, Ok.
552021,Jonny,2011-02-16 03:15:00,1380," Urban encroachment and all that human ""invasive"" stuff is beside the point. We're not going to stop expanding because we feel guilty about it. We might, however, change HOW we expand.  We do a good job of managing viable populations of fish and wildlife, and we almost always manage with more fish and wildlife in mind. That should not mean, however that when there is an imbalance caused by OVER-population of a species, that we should feel guilty about controlling it.  A cormorant isn't sacrosanct just because it's a wild bird. Even deer aren't sacrosanct when they eat up Carolinian forest, or damage too many crops,  or start colliding with vehicles too often.  Managing means trying to strike a balance; it doesn't mean trying to manage for maximum populations of everything.  I would argue that cormorants are not a necessary part of the equation on freshwater lakes."
552030,mercman,2011-02-16 03:40:00,7054,"My Point was this. With all the talk about invasive species and such, we are forgeting that in the big picture, we are also an invasive species. The cormorant problem is of our own doing. 40 years ago, they were almost extinct.Then we decided to fix the huge mess we made of this planet, by cleaning up the polution and poisons we put into out lakes and streams.Thus providing the remaining cormorant population with an ideal habitat to begin to reestablish its populations.We SHOULD have forseen the problems this would cause, but we didnt.And now we are stuck with them.Nothing we could do at this point would have an effect for years.We are responsible for cormorants, gobies,zebra mussels, earwigs,spruce bud worm, dutch elm disease,asian carp,snakehead,killer bees, etc etc etc."
552033,Jonny,2011-02-16 03:47:00,1380," OK, I don't really have an argument with that.  But here on Nipissing, I think that we could make an immediate dent in the cormorant population. With a concerted effort starting this spring in the nesting areas, co-ordinated by the MNR and staffed by numerous volunteers, I'd bet we could halve the cormorant population on this lake by 2013 at the most, and drastically more after that.  Of course it won't happen. It seems too many people think we shouldn't or can't do anything, and the MNR certainly isn't antsy to move.   "
552074,Gregoire,2011-02-16 11:52:00,1397,"I think it is important to remember that gone are the days when one, or a group of people would see something wrong with the environment and they would then act on it. Quite often we recognize a problem and identify a solution to the problem through our perception of what has happened. The issue here is that what we  think is the problem may not be, it just may be a change associated with the problem. If we act based on anecdotal evidence instead of the actual facts, then we may cause more harm than good. For the most part this is the argument that people on this forum are giving towards culling cormorants.  I would guess that most people who argued against a cull would have no problem if there was legitimate evidence to support it. I would argue that this is not anything but a P3TA or hippie attutide. If we are to engage in a debate we should not fall into the habit of stereotyping our opponents as people who are diametrically opposed to us. I would suggest that the members of this board have very similar values and beliefs, and if we disagree with each other just try to keep in mind that we have a lot in common."

With a little bit of sarcasim, tongue in cheek, and genreal humor mixed in. LOVE this site   Even the MNR agrees more study is needed but I think the BIGGEST issue even with regards to any further evaluation is the available study material is about 90% in relation to the great lakes....No one is looking at smaller lake impacts. The MNR is in full agreement that the Cormorant boom ""May"" be a factor in the Perch and Bass declines the great lakes is seeing however further study is needed....I'd like to see that study done on smaller lake effected to get a true look into what a flock of 500-1000 birds can do on a day trip to the suburbs...  Not that Nippising is a small lake by any means... But there is little publicized research being done there. The OFAH, Muskies Canada and the general public consensus up that way are in agreement there is an issue, So to me that is enough of a concern to warrant a second look for sure.  Seeing islands decimated, and simply knowing these birds are increasing in Algonquin park specifically Is definatly the biggest concern to me and sets off red flags when thinking about other small unmonitored lakes. If there is enough concerned about a lake the Size Nippising or Huron..... There is definatly even more concern for Smaller inland lakes these flocks visit, and colonize. Further to the point, There was a definate sanctioned cull of these birds on Opeongo....I know this to be a fact. So that in its self also says the MNR has reasons for concern in select situations. In fact I'm positive there have been other culls in Ontario proving the MNR is in somecases is doing something about the issue, and this proves the detrimental aspect this bird can have, and that they feel a cull IS an effective tool in controlling the birds population if only on small scale operation....the question this raises is can the MNR accuratly assess small lakes through out the province in a Lake by lake scenario that is done in a timely manner so we can manage the damage before its a major issue.

Btw, do you honestly think that other species haven't moved from one habitat to others via natural means in the past?  It's only humans that do that?  We are doing exactly what we have naturally evolved to do, that doesn't mean the end results are always good, but it doesn't make it unatural or invasive.  We are a natural byproduct of this planets biological evolution just like every other living thing.  We are intelligent enough to have technologies that can have large adverse impacts on the world, but we can also use that big brain to be rational and make decisions that improve our lives while not destroying the world around us.

It is based on economic ignorance and fed by a feeling that one’s self-identified moral superiority makes one’s every idea possible merely because one has thought it, along with millions of other progressive-minded individuals.  While it is true that the current cost of alternative energy is high, and will have an impact on our economy, the price of inaction may be even higher. In 2006 this issue was studied and the findings were published in the Stern Review. The review looked at climate change, so you need to believe in climate change in order for this report to have any relevance. (I would argue that climate change may have something to do with the explosion in the cormorant population.) Here is a link to the review itself: http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTINDONESIA/Resources/226271-1170911056314/3428109-1174614780539/SternReviewEng.pdf Here is a link to the a wikipedia page: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stern_Review  The review came to the conclusion that the longer we put off finding alternative sources of energy the more expensive it will be for us as a society to find a solution when fosil fuels are no longer a viable option. Even if you do not aggree with this opinion it is an interesting perspective."
551612,Jonny,2011-02-15 00:37:00,1380," Well we're getting away from cormorants completely, despite your creative injection of them at one point.   ... but anyway...  As fossil fuels dwindle, energy will get more expensive and alternative sources will then become ""economical"". It's going to happen whether we put off alternative sources or not. The only thing that changes by jumping into alternatives now  is that it gets expensive FASTER, as we are finding out thanks to Mr. McGuinty.  In my opinion we should have gone wholesale NUCLEAR for our power grid. The ultimate green energy for a country like Canada.  "
551621,Gregoire,2011-02-15 01:01:00,1397,"You are right, that is mostly off topic. However, abandoning alternative energy sources and culling cormorants do have one thing in common. They are an easy, painless solution that so not address the root cause of the problem.

551744,Cookslav,2011-02-15 14:23:00,1457," First off, I wasn't adressing you specifically as a tree hugger( I can't see your long hair from here) But seriously Dude....its totally tongue in cheek sarcasim and I appologise. Don't take it personal I guess sometimes I forget the CPU doesn't project that....my bad  But since I'm here As far as I'm concerned fishing is not just a past time. I could argue its and industry in both tourism, and commercial markets, but to me it more about the tradition. And Cormorants are detrimental to all of the above period. So yes...Cormorants are very similar to Locust, rodents, or Gobbies for that matter. Suggesting otherwise on a fishing forum is crazy talk.  On the less ""hippie'ish"" side of the issue... Like it or not there is even less proof floating around out there to suggest an organized Cull would be less effective then any alternatives. And I simply hate the idea of waiting it out for nature to do her thing when these dam birds eat 20 to 30% of their body weight per day, and are branching out to sensitive areas like Algonquin Park.... What I'm getting at here in a nut shell, Waiting it out is probobly not a very condusive solution either IMO.  I just find it all a bit funny when culls are veiwed so ineffective While on the other side of the argument we blame our selves for overfishing/hunting as a cause for the depletion Of our resources that we are trying to protect. Its kinda the same thing is it not?.... Depleting the population of a subject by removing said subjects from the enviroment on a large scale??? Kind of an oximoron if you ask me  I have heard over and over of the ineffectivness of Coyote Culls yet in Huron and Grey counties they put a $50 bounty on them, and are seeing significant reductions in predidation losses....interesting food for thought?  Personally I'd support a cull, and like to see an egg oiling program similar to the Canadian Geese in southern Ontario....it beats the heck out of the alternative of waiting, and if it doesn't work, then its simply back to the drawing board."
551757,Jonny,2011-02-15 15:57:00,1380,"To my mind, the Ontario MNR has a few key reasons for not doing anything about cormorants:  Doing nothing costs nothing. Doing nothing avoids controversy. I'm sure the MNR would rather weather complaints from fishing/cottaging/camping stakeholders than from the flak they think they would get from the general public and the tree-huggers. Doing nothing is simply easier than doing something. The MNR isn't the most innovative or forward-thinking organization around.  I don't think their reasoning includes anything that says that a control program can't have significant results. I think that's smokescreen (Cookslav, I think, kinda nailed it when he talked about overfishing/overhunting vs culling).  It's hard to speak for other parts of Ontario but people around Nipissing love the lake enough, and have a close enough connection to it, that if a cormorant control program were initiated on the lake with the avowed goal of reducing the number of cormorants by culling and oiling eggs, the public opposition would be minimal. I'm pretty confident that would translate to other areas and lakes as well.  As for cost, if the MNR were to get off their butts (if they would quit rationalizing and studying the problem) and give people the opportunity to do something, I think you would have tons of unpaid volunteers come forth, made up of sport fishers, outfitters, cottagers, first nations, you name it."
551785,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-02-15 18:42:00,0,"All I ask for is a single published resource showing how cormorants are responsible for the decline of a commercially or recreationally important species...  I can provide plenty that state the otherwise...  When you guys can provide hard science to back up your claims, I'll grab my pitchfork..."
551841,mercman,2011-02-15 21:51:00,7054,  No takers yet eh Doc ???
551851,solopaddler,2011-02-15 22:14:00,8605,In retrospect it's highly probable that the MNR released all those cougars to cull the cormonart population.  It's pretty obvious how that's working out.
551874,ehg,2011-02-15 23:29:00,2666,"I kind of agree, i haven't heard anything solid suggesting cormorants have decimated a fish population somewhere in Ontario.    Some think (just kill 'em all) is the final solution."
551917,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-02-16 00:33:00,0,apparently my posts are disappearing!  i wonder which good ol' boy i offended this time?    The same reason this post was edited. Would you like to discuss this in P.M. and press the issue?  Art
551919,Bernie,2011-02-16 00:35:00,3190,"Doc. I agree that in some cases a study may be required.  But when you see what these birds are capable of, and being on the water I am studying the situation every day through the summer. Just because my expertise is in automotive doesn't mean I am oblivious to everything else. I pay attention to the waters that I was raised on. It concerns me. But because I don't have the proper paperwork means my opinion is to be ignored?  A couple years ago they were putting in new water lines and sewers past our shop. My dad told them they wouldn't be able to dig through the area they were planning on. ""Don't worry"" they replied, the experts checked it out. Well they did, sort of, I watched them halfheartedly do some checking previously. A couple days later the excavator was buried up over the cab with only the hoe sticking out. My father has been around long enough to see when the area they were trying to go across was a filled in swamp.  So when I hear of ""studies"" and from many experiences from what I have seen, studies don't necessarily mean it's correct. You also need to take into account those that have good advise to give."
550808,Jonny,2011-02-12 20:20:00,1380," If you are addressing two major problems and you push for a third related one to be addressed, is that scapegoating? I don't think so. I have a feeling you think it's scapegoating because to you it seems that controlling cormorant populations is a drastic strategy.   Did you mean ""I do not think that it is ideal""?   Inertia is on your side. It's easier to do nothing than it is to do something.  You're right - we do have the largest impact, but we also have the largest say in how to manage resources.  Sometimes we even have to RE-balance things, such as expanding deer hunting opportunities because there are too many as a result of lack of predators (which we got rid of).  I don't see a ""dangerous precedent"". We're not talking about getting rid of a vital part of the ecosystem. We're talking about getting rid of (or controlling) an organism without which the ecosystem was working just fine. Letting cormorants proliferate is in some respects the same as introducing rabbits to Australia.  We are supposed to believe that cormorants were at one time common in the Great Lakes basin. I wonder, is there evidence of flocks of thousands during, say, the days of the Fur Trade, or of flocks so large that they darkened the sky? Or what about say the 1920's or 30's, before DDT?   "
550811,Gregoire,2011-02-12 20:39:00,1397,"Sorry about the quadruple negatives. I do not think that we are diametrically opposed on this issue. I just think that we need to be cautious with our approach to the issue. What has caused the cormorant population to explode? What effect would culling the population have on the ecosystem? If we had an effective population we could do a study and determine the causes. Unfortunately our government has proven to be mostly inept in addressing environmental issues. The one issue we definitely disagree on is whether killing a species is drastic or not. I think it is, you think it is not. Your argument about inertia is not apt. If I took the easy way out, and did not respond to your proposal to cull cormorants I would be doing nothing. I would suggest that killing an animal because you perceive it to be the problem is taking the easy way out."
550865,Jonny,2011-02-12 22:51:00,1380," The only thing that I have run across that could serve as an answer, or part of an answer, is that now that cormorants have survived decimation by DDT, their populations rage unchecked because they have few natural predators. Apparently on ocean coastlines of North America, bald eagles are a significant predator on cormorants. There aren't many bald eagles in the Great Lakes Basin, I don't think.   None. We would simply be back to where we were 10 or 15 years ago with few or no cormorants on most lakes.   In most cases I would probably consider it drastic. In the case of cormorants, which were not necessary to our ecological balance and indeed now unbalance it, no, I don't.   Actually I see it as the hard way. Controlling cormorants would take a LOT of work, and more with each passing year that we do nothing. The easy way (but hard on the fisheries and the environment) would be to do nothing and let the cormorant population peak, with the attendant fishery and habitat destruction. I think I'm looking at ease/difficulty from a practical standpoint whereas you may be looking at it from a moral/ethical one."
550870,Gregoire,2011-02-12 22:57:00,1397,"Maybe the problem is that the eagle population has been wiped out. A solution might be to bring eagles back, if it ever existed. This is definitely a longer term solution then culling.  I believe if we do not act according to morals or ethics we should not act at all. It seems animalistic to kill off a species because it is in competition with us. (That is both an opinion and a philosophical standpoint on my part.)"
550931,Jonny,2011-02-13 01:06:00,1380," Yes, obviously a solution that has some long-term potential, but WAY too slow to fix an explosion of numbers.   When I brought up the moral/ethical idea I did have in mind that the morals or ethics are not fixed absolutes. In other words, an ethical stance would not mean no culling (killing) under any circumstances. In management of fish and game (or other orders such as insects, amphibians, etc.) moral or ethical arguments would apply in a similar way as to the provision of beef, pork or poultry for the table.  Of course that's not to say that wildlife doesn't have some intrinsic values other than edibility.  What happens if the fox won't leave the hen house alone, even though you've done what you can to keep him out? You shoot the fox.  I would look at the ethical side of culling cormorants more like a farmer dealing with a plague of locusts. The farmer doesn't care where the locusts came from. All he's concerned with is that they weren't there and eating his crops before, and he wants to re-establish the previous status quo (i.e. no locusts and a good crop). He might be losing a significant but bearable portion of his crops to deer, rodents and birds, but he doesn't need the added burden of the locusts.   "
550939,hammercarp,2011-02-13 01:12:00,964,"This is a very interesting discussion. Wanna bet a graph that looks something like this is sitting on the walls and desks of people looking at the issue, in the OMNR and at the Canada Centre for Inland Waters.  But there is no getting around that we , that is people, really have taken a big chunk out of the fish population. It just seems a shame that just when we should has seen the positive impact of C&R practices that that has been negated by the rising cormorant population. Part of the reason I took up promoting carp fishing was to help take the pressure off of other species. It may be something small but I feel good about that."
550945,Gregoire,2011-02-13 01:23:00,1397," The only issue I have with this argument is that fishing is a recreational sport. Most people do not rely on angling as a means of sustenance. The locusts threaten the livelihood of a farmer whereas the cormorants threaten our pastime. Just as an aside: in your analogy you seem to be referring to locusts as cormorants and as deer, rodents and birds as humans. I find that reasoning to be philosophically unsound."
550946,Gregoire,2011-02-13 01:26:00,1397," I have heard this argument over and over, I just wonder what evidence supports this argument. If there is more than anecdotal evidence then the movement to cull cormorants gains some legitimacy."
550954,hammercarp,2011-02-13 01:54:00,964,I fish beside the CCIW building during the spring and I can tell you that they are already doing field work on how to cull cormorants. It took a while but I believe that they have the data that warrants this.
550956,Gregoire,2011-02-13 01:58:00,1397, That is interesting and good to know.
551010,Jonny,2011-02-13 03:59:00,1380," Yep, starting to plug up one hole and another one opens up.   Good stuff. I started doing that many years ago in my own way, changing my own attitude to make pike and perch just as much a target of my fishing efforts as pickerel.   They threaten our quality of life. Fishing is more than a pastime; it's a way of life. Not to mention - as I keep injecting - the environment. Can you think of any other creature that can absolutely destroy a beautiful island in a matter of one summer?   That's not what I had in mind, and I didn't see it coming across that way.   "
551012,Gregoire,2011-02-13 04:08:00,1397,"I love fishing, it adds enjoyment and meaning to my life. At times it seems like it is the only thing that can set me right. The argument I would make is that, unlike a farmer, I would be able to survive without fishing. I find it hard to imagine a farmer surviving without crops. Again this is a philosophical point. Since this seems to have turned in to a philosophical argument you should make sure that your arguments are philosophically sound.  Let's agree to disagree. Maybe some day you can show me in person what the fishery in North Bay is like, and I can show you how to catch an urban pike. That is if you don't mind associating with a left wing pinko as I'm sure Don Cherry would characterize me."
551017,Jonny,2011-02-13 04:32:00,1380," It's not a perfect analogy but it's the best I can come up with, sorry. If I made the analogy any closer, then it would be identical, and not an analogy at all, and would lose its illustrative value.   Sure. If we don't catch any fish I can always blame the cormorants!  I don't mind left-wing pinkos, unless they're too fanatic about it.   "
551021,Gregoire,2011-02-13 04:44:00,1397,The only thing I'm fanatical about is fishing...and football. That is all.

We run a Yahoo league based on the NFL. I'm also a big NFL fan. I have no use for the CFL though; it's a poor game by comparison.  My team has always been the Steelers, but I also like the Bills, the Eagles, and the Packers.  It's going to be a long drought again till the next season.   "
551149,Gregoire,2011-02-13 18:39:00,1397,Tell me about it...the only advantage is I might focus even more attention of coaching.
551155,Bernie,2011-02-13 19:14:00,3190,"Just a note on this subject. DDT wasn't used as an insecticide until it was discovered it had that capability in 1939. There were no cormorants on Nipissing at that time. My father has repeatedly stated that. So it is an anomaly, but not sure of the cause, only the drastic effect. I also believe they should be culled, maybe even eradicated here. Not a natural thing. The cormorants are taking up natural habitat of the herring gulls and their numbers are decreasing because of it. And as Jocko said, where they are taking up residence all vegetation has been decimated."
551177,Jonny,2011-02-13 21:22:00,1380," Good to know, Bernie. I didn't know anything about that far back. I know that in the 50's, 60's and 70's, there were none on the lake.   Here's an example of cormorants and herring gulls. The ""Rockpile"" near the Goose Islands used to be exclusively gull territory...     "
551229,hammercarp,2011-02-14 00:20:00,964,The same thing has happened here in Hamilton Harbour. The herring gulls have been pushed off their nesting sights by cormorants and ringbill gulls. Off of Eastport Dr. here the gulls start competing for nest sites at the end of March. The one impoundment wall that runs perpendicular to Eastport is completely white with gulls by April. Then the cormorants show up and you can see it happen. First there is a small black section then it grows and grows and by may it is 3/4 black. Of course the small trees are all dead.
551470,blarg,2011-02-14 17:58:00,289,"This argument always ends up in the same place.  What i want to know, is how far those on the ""left"" side of this issue are willing to go in their own lives in order to maintain the natural order of things.  The reality is that we, through our actions have irrevocably changed the environment, we are as much a part of that environemnt as any lesser creature on this planet.  Other creatures also change the environment sometimes to the detriment of others, of course humans have a much greater impact than any other living thing, that is until the next pandemic, but then viruses are just innocent creatures, we shouldn't interfere with their work.. So where does reality come into play, are we going to cull our own species so there is more room for the birds?  Do we stop drilling for oil and no doubt plunge the world into chaos?  The reality is that we aren't going anywhee and we are as much a part of this world as the birds and the viruses.  The difference is that we can recognize our mistakes and hopefully improve things, but that doesn't mean that when a treasured resource is being dmaged that we can't act, the fact of the matter is that cormorants are not endangered, if they are damaging a resource there is no reason, except for maybe some pie in the sky leave nature alone philosophy, that we shouldn't act.  I am an environmentalist, i have degrees to prove it, but i am also a realist, in the real world our actions have consequences. sometimes we make choices to improve our life at the detriment of the rest of our world, sometimes we take action to rebalance that world the best we can.  This progressive idea that every animal is sacred and nature will fix things is so ridiculous, when distilled down to its essence that philoshphy would have us all living in grass huts, its nonsense.  This quote was in the National post today, in an atricle by lorne gunter, it is refering to green power in Ontario but it sums up many similar arguments that progressives like to make, such as this thread, or the gun registry etc  ""This mentality is rooted in anti-market, pro-government indoctrination. It is based on economic ignorance and fed by a feeling that one’s self-identified moral superiority makes one’s every idea possible merely because one has thought it, along with millions of other progressive-minded individuals.  It is both smug and fanciful.""  http://fullcomment.nationalpost.com/2011/02/14/lorne-gunter-the-growing-nightmare-of-mcguintys-green-energy-dream/#ixzz1Dwt74vuC  We are as much a part of the environment as any cormorant, if we decide to reduce their numbers by a sensible amount it doesn`t make us immoral, in fact given that we are a natural part of the environment our actions are also natural."
551494,Sinker,2011-02-14 19:24:00,8692,"Fishing is a lot more than a pastime, or hobby. What about commercial fisherman? Fisheries as a resource???

S."
551547,hammercarp,2011-02-14 21:12:00,964,"  Well said.I believe your point is very valid. No matter what we think or which side we think we're on, we cannot escape the fact that we live in and are part of the natural world. All creatures exploit and effect the environment."

Here's something I've been wondering, looking at those pics of the numerous cormorants on the ""Rockpile"" when there used to be none...  We are told, on pretty good authority I would assume, that cormorants were almost extinguished in the Great lakes Basin because of DDT. Since the DDT was in fish, and since cormorants and gulls eat mostly fish, why would the DDT have virtually wiped out the cormorants but not the gulls?  Is it possible that a cormorant's metabolism requires it to eat a LOT more than a gull, thus concentrating a lot more DDT in its body?"

550465,mercman,2011-02-11 21:26:00,7054,  THERE YA GO AGAIN !!!!Yer killin me over here.
550474,Gregoire,2011-02-11 21:54:00,1397,I guess my point is that instead of saying the cormorants are the problem and killing them all we should try to look at what role we play. Before a bunch of you go off on a tangent about government studies and waste: that is not what I am suggesting. I just think that we need to realize that as the dominant species in the ecosystem we play the largest role in determining the health of that ecosystem. Blindly killing off all the animals that we consider pests does not seem to be the best way to confront problems in my opinion. Has there not been movements by Walleye anglers to kill off Muskies because they considered them a pest? There seem to be similarities between killing off Musky ad killing off Cormorants.
550491,jedimaster,2011-02-11 22:19:00,3472,Accept now people like Musky.Bass fishermen hate Pike. Walleye diehards hate crappie... but pretty much all fishermen hate Cormorants.  If we as fishermen really wanted fish to increase in numbers we would all stop fishing for 5 years. Imagine is not a single lure or hook hit the water for 5 years.
550492,manitoubass2,2011-02-11 22:28:00,11391," If everyone stopped fishing for 5 years, I'd go insane. But it would be neat to see how the fish reacted to that type of thing.  Also, I think anglers have improved leaps and bounds as far as respecting other species of fish? At least it seems that way, to me, in my area. All fish play a roll in, and so do cormorants I suppose.  I for one used to hate suckers, now every year I target them for a few days when they feed at the top of the rapids. So fun to catch a solid 15lber that runs into the rapids, feels similar to steelheading. Great fun"
550495,jedimaster,2011-02-11 22:31:00,3472,"I have often wondered what would happen if the had rolling catch and release fishing, so that every lake would have CnR fishing only for a couple years... Not saying I would be all that happy about it, but it sure would be interesting to see how a large lake system would respond to something like that."
550496,manitoubass2,2011-02-11 22:33:00,11391," I could handle the C&R only, and yes, it would be very interesting. Especially on lakes like rainy lake or lake of the woods."
550509,Gregoire,2011-02-11 22:58:00,1397,There are lakes that are C&R only. I'd love to see this happen in some waterways. I fish in downtown Toronto and would love to see that area be a C&R area. When you consider that a lot of the fish in this area may not be that healthy It might be a good idea.

550521,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-02-11 23:19:00,0,"amen PT.  as resource users we have to stop pointing fingers at cormorants, aboriginal netting, aka the other guy syndrome and realize that we are all responsible for the decline of our fisheries. but i love the argument that ""we used to be able to catch a pail of perch in an hour here whenever we wanted""...  hmmmm... food for thought."
550600,Jonny,2011-02-12 03:19:00,1380,"Fact is, there are a lot of significant factors to point a finger at, including sport fishing, but I don't think that means we should stop pointing fingers.  I don't remember the exact netting quota for the native fishery on Nipissing but I believe it's pegged at about 65-70 % of the total allowable catch of walleye. Is it too high? Nobody is really sure.  Sport fishermen impact the lake heavily as well, summer and winter.  We already have reduced limits and a slot size for walleye (for sport angling) because the fishery is stressed.  Add thousands upon thousands of cormorants to that scenario and it's no wonder that the idea of controlling cormorants gets a lot of support. I mean, look at the pictures of that cut-open cormorant. That bird gorged itself on dozens of bait-fish perch in one very short feeding period (the perch are hardly digested). The thing is a damned underwater vacuum cleaner! Repeat that every day, or several times a day, over the open water season and multiply it by thousands of birds and you start to have an inkling of the impact these birds probably have.  I don't think I'm comfortable with throwing up our hands and saying either:  a ) There's nothing we can do  or  b ) This is a natural cycle and we just have to let it take its course  Both of these things seem to be a cop out if we want to preserve fisheries and preserve environment.  I'll show you something I'm afraid of happening, separate from the fishing issue...  The attached photos show some of the small island habitat that is rather rare along the north shore of Nipissing. If I see cormorants starting to show indications of nesting on these islands and turning them into a stinking wasteland, you can be sure I won't be sitting around waiting for someone else to do something...   "
550609,Gregoire,2011-02-12 03:41:00,1397,"Jocko, you seem to have a lot of issues that you are dealing with. Did you read the old posts on this topic. You definitely have a point, but I think you should consider the human impact on fish stocks before you blame and cull an animal."
550627,Jonny,2011-02-12 04:55:00,1380," Yes, Greg, I read the previous thread in its entirety.  I should give you a bit of background so you know where I'm coming from.  When I was a kid, I fished Lake Nipissing with great regularity with my parents in the 50's and 60's and we didn't even know what a cormorant looked like. There were absolutely NONE on the lake. If we had seen one we would have researched it. My family are avid bird watchers. At times when a cormorant flock on Nipissing is the largest, I've done counts on them, and I have seen flocks that easily top a thousand birds. Once I estimated 1500 by going through a video I took in slow motion mode. You will see ""600+"" mentioned in the 2004 letter because I had not seen the bigger flocks yet.       I've been at this for a while, with letters to the minister and letters to the editor of the North Bay Nugget."
550649,Gregoire,2011-02-12 12:38:00,1397,You have obviously made numerous attempts raise awareness about cormorants. What impact have you seen on the fishery?
550675,Rich,2011-02-12 15:22:00,3927,lol You could stick 300 of those birds of Long Point Bay and they aren't nearly so harmful as the human locals.
550693,Muskieman,2011-02-12 16:12:00,2472," I'm with Jocko in this one..  As a lifelong Nipissing resident and angler ... Impact:  when I was 10 years old I was able to walk 1 block away from my home after school and fish from shore.. bring back a limit of 6 Walleye in about 30 minutes anyday of the week...during the summer I would spend all week fishing and was able to catch fish after fish...not just (Nipissing's golden nugget)Walleye...my catches would vary everyday...from Smallies , Redhorses, Pike , Muskie,Sturgeon and all sorts of coarse fish along with an abundant amount of Eyes.  Now 23 years later,I bring my kids to the very spot that used to be so successful.  we sometimes spend all day down there and see 4 fish all day. Every species of fish that dwells in Nipissing has taken a substantial hit.  Now this is just one little anecdote...  multiply that by 6000+ local anglers .. and now we have a problem..  I can assure you that anglers have a large role to play in the problem..  Some might say that it's cyclical  I do know this ...in the late 70's and early 80's there were no flocks of 1000+ Cormorants in the cycle.  Randy "
550728,Gregoire,2011-02-12 16:58:00,1397," That sounds like a very frustrating situation. My only point is that there are probably a lot of factors that have caused this problem. It is easy to find a scapegoat and blame the cormorants, because then the problem isn't us."
550780,Jonny,2011-02-12 18:59:00,1380," For sport anglers on Nipissing we have reduced limits and slot limits. For the native netting fishery there is a quota (perhaps excessive, but a quota). Those are the two biggest impacts on the lake.  Cormorants are the wild card... something that didn't impact the lake in the past. We don't really need thousands of cormorants thrown into the mix. They're NOT a scapegoat --- we know that fishery problems don't rest solely (or even mainly) with cormorants. What they are is an unaddressed problem loaded on top of other problems that are already being addressed.    "
550783,Gregoire,2011-02-12 19:14:00,1397," Noun	1.	scapegoat - someone who is punished for the errors of others  I would counter that according to the definition that is exactly what you are doing. I do not necessarily think that controlling animal populations should not be done (however I do not think that it is not ideal) i just think that we need to recognize that human beings have the single largest impact on the ecosystem. Blindly stating that culling or exterminating the population of cormorants will solve all our problems sets a dangerous precedent. All I am arguing is that we need be aware that this attitude, or philosophy if you prefer, is problematic"
550091,Joeytier,2011-02-10 23:08:00,3990,I wonder what kind of response a 'Contents of One Bait Shops Minnow Tank' would garner.
550268,Jonny,2011-02-11 05:25:00,1380,"Here are a couple more photos...  I'm sure the MNR will continue to ""study"" the problem until our sport fish stocks are truly decimated.  "
550271,Jonny,2011-02-11 05:39:00,1380," You got any photos of this, Manitou?   "
550278,manitoubass2,2011-02-11 07:00:00,11391," No, but I wish I did. It was insane. I've never seen anything like it. Me and two buddies were heading up to the north arm, where his cabin is, and for the first night we just set up a tent on on island 1/4 mile away, just BBQ'd and had some beers. That was the evening it happened, and most of our gear was at the cabin, including our cameras.  I'm not sure if that was common occurance, or just one certain day, but it was very crazy"
550309,Gregoire,2011-02-11 13:25:00,1397," I've got to agree with that point. We can blame animals all we want, but if we as humans do not change the way we behave it won't make a lick of difference. Think about it, should we blame the animals who act on instinct or should we realize that we are the only species that can make logical decions and use reason (some of us anyway)."
550322,Jonny,2011-02-11 13:59:00,1380," That starts to tread on philosophical ground, but the fact is that we humans like to arrange things to suit ourselves. As far as animal life is concerned we like to control populations of creatures that we find a nuisance. Think as basic as mosquitoes which carry malaria, and insects and animals that destroy crops. I'm not suggesting that the thought in previous posts has gone this far, but should we feel guilty about that?     "
550326,Jonny,2011-02-11 14:03:00,1380, Maybe someone does.  I thought it was bad when I was able to count flocks of about 1000 to 1500 on Nipissing. What you describe would be simply outrageous.   
550387,manitoubass2,2011-02-11 17:35:00,11391," I'm sure someone does, there was 50-60 other boats in the area, being it was around the end of july it gets pretty busy.  I'm not 100% sure, but my buddie that owned the cabin said that happens quite often, they all spread out to feed, then in the evenings they all migrate back to the cascades at the very north end"
550391,Gregoire,2011-02-11 17:55:00,1397," Are you comparing Mosquitoes to Cormorants? As far as I know cormorants do not directly spread disease or illness to humans. It seems like you are the one trying to have a philisophical discussion. I was just stating an opinion.  A month or so ago we had a similar thread, all we seem to be doing is rehashing old debates."
550398,Jonny,2011-02-11 18:20:00,1380," I certainly am. Like I said, we like to control species that we find a nuisance. That applies to mosquitoes, cormorants and any number of other species.    No problem. But when you state such an opinion, you're on philosophical ground as well as just factual.     I wasn't reading these threads a month ago.  It seems to me that threads with this kind of issue will keep coming up from time to time, as long as an issue is not resolved. Are you suggesting that, since there has already been some discussion in the past, we should now simply ignore the problem and not talk about it any more?   "

550420,Jonny,2011-02-11 20:02:00,1380," Nothing major, I wouldn't think. Of course there is a difference in how and why we treat the mosquito problem and how and why we treat the cormorant problem (thought the fact remains that they are both good examples of how we like to manage problems).  Maybe a better analogy would be locusts in a farmer's grain field. The farmer wants the grain for his own uses but the locusts will eat it all up if they get the chance. Does it make sense for the farmer to do all he can to control the depredations of the locusts?     I took ""we are the only species that can make logical decisions and use reason"" as a statement of fact. I can appreciate you weren't trying to get philosophical, if you say so. I think I was merely pointing out that it could go that way.   Thanks. Is everything in this thread a simple repetition of what's in that one? I'll have a look...    "
550423,JohnF,2011-02-11 20:09:00,3494," Great point. Is it possible that these random gun kills only act as culls to in fact strengthen the species? Let them thrive for a few years and they'll starve themselves out by cutting their natural forage supply, or kill each other with the stench.  JF"
550424,jedimaster,2011-02-11 20:13:00,3472,"They did a shoot on Opeongo some years ago, the problem is after about 5 shots from each of the shooters they all flew away and scattered to other islands and parts of the park they weren't at before. Sounds like a job for a 9mm with a silencer."
550427,mercman,2011-02-11 20:20:00,7054,Should teach the suckers to eat snakehead and goby.  
550428,Jonny,2011-02-11 20:20:00,1380,"Normally that would be the way to go - let a natural cycle take care of things. But somehow the cormorant population is exploding and there's a chance that by the time a natural balance re-asserts itself, there will have been so much damage to fisheries and to some areas of habitat (i.e. picturesque islands) that you and I will never live to see an upswing.  Regardless, if the reports of these huge flocks that darken the sky are accurate, we've already missed the chance to control the situation. While people have been sitting on their hands wondering whether things should be done, the time to do them is probably already past.   "

550432,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-02-11 20:30:00,0,"  There is no exception to natures law.  Fecundity, mortality, food abundance etc. are limiting factors for any species including us.  Any species expanding their range will experience a population explosion.  This is high school level population dynamics.  I don't mean to simplify a complex problem like this, but suggesting their population growth is limitless or ""we're too late"" is hogwash!"

550435,manitoubass2,2011-02-11 20:33:00,11391," This was years ago on Rainy Lake. I was just having coffee with a rainy lake lodge owner and he told me it's reduced drastically the past couple years without intervention. However, he did say that for 2-3 years it really damaged the fishery, to the point where many of his guest were no longer returning (at the time). And Rainy Lake is a huge lake, so thats can speaks volumes for how many of these birds frequented that lake, just like I witnessed."
550436,jedimaster,2011-02-11 20:35:00,3472," Bang on, the cormorants will boom, fish will die, cormorant population will drop along with other animals in the area that cormants prey on  in the area they have decimated. EG, sportfish, Loons, Osprey etc...not to mention fishermen...  As far as I know the only species that will completely wipe out a natural resource without finding natural balance are Humans and Virii."
550439,manitoubass2,2011-02-11 20:41:00,11391,"Has anyone else witnessed massive flocks of these birds?  I wish I could have filmed it, as much as I hate them, it was quite neat to see their brutal dominance of the water. There was an obvious pattern, following pelicans into small bays or shorelines, then plucking fish from the water, as well as the pelicans. Then the pelicans flew to the next spot, and repeat this cycle over and over"
550445,Jonny,2011-02-11 20:51:00,1380,"I didn't say their population growth is limitless. What I said was that by the time the population crashes there will probably have been a huge amount of damage.  As far as ""we're too late"", I am willing to say you might be quite right. Maybe there never was anything we could do about it.  But we certainly have affected the natural process in other places : carrier pigeons, bison, whales, etc. etc. etc.  Maybe there never was anything we could do about cormorants because... well... who would ever eat one?!

549853,bigbuck,2011-02-10 15:36:00,2449,A few years ago a bunch of natives went hunting up on Georgian Bay.

549947,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-02-10 18:34:00,0," i've witnessed this on superior.  however they are very difficult to get close to, and hitting a target from the deck of a heaving 50 footer ain't easy!  the old tug captain had a pretty good shot though.  that said, controlling them in this way does nothing for them.  it would be better to allow nature to do so, and let their population naturally collapse.  if you suppress the population, they'll just keep trying to flourish.  if nature suppresses them, it may be a much longer term solution."
