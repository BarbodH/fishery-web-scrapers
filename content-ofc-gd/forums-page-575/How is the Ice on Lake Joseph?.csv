550967,FishAbout,2011-02-13 02:09:00,106,"Ice is good. Snow and slush is not.  Tried to get my hut out friday, could not get it out. Spent 3 days this week packing down a trail, but thrusday night it snowed 2 feet on top of what we had. Slush everywhere.  Will not be fun for ATV's.  Going to be work for any machine to get out.  Going to check tommorow and see if the slush is better and work on making a new trail, may be a lost cause with warm weather coming."
550972,Guest gbfisher,2011-02-13 02:14:00,0,Wouldn't be opener if there wasnt a ton of slush and snow out there. I'm told the whole lake is a slushfest with two feet of snow on top.

551811,batoathome,2011-02-15 20:28:00,47,"ready for the slush, might have to break out the river gear this weekend"
551813,Guest gbfisher,2011-02-15 20:32:00,0,"If yer planning on Saturday. After Friday I'm gonna guess that the snow will melt and the water left will freeze only an inch or two over night which will make using an ATV impossible. Snowmobiles won't have fun either. If ya ask me, it's not worth driving to Joe with conditions like that. Give it a couple weeks. Right now the entire lake is grey. There's still a ton of snow on top with a ton of slush under that. Just sayin...."
