It is also likely to be one of the most comfortable with most of the amenities working that a long-haul trucker would want."""

551713,Billy Bob,2011-02-15 11:34:00,5865,"Do all the lights work....  I don't see reflective tape all over it so it must be just a day time ice shack....  BTW.....is this what you guys call ice fishing or socializing.....get a 5 gallon bucket to carry your gear, put your hand auger over your shoulder and hike out a mile or three, drill the damn hole and catch a fish.....now that's how I did it when I was young and dumb..."
