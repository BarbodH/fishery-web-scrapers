A  black hearse was followed by a second  black hearse about 50 feet behind  the first one.    Behind the second hearse was a solitary man walking a dog on a leash.    Behind him, a short distance back, were about 200 men walking single file.    The man couldn't stand the curiosity.    He respectfully approached the man walking the dog and said, ""I am so sorry  for your loss, and this may be a bad time to disturb you, but I've never  seen a funeral like this. ""Whose funeral is it?""    ""My wife's.""    ''What happened to her?""    The man replied, ""My dog attacked and killed her.""    He inquired further, ""But who is in the second hearse?""    The man answered, ""My mother-in-law. She was trying to help my wife when the  dog turned on her.""    A very  poignant and touching moment,  of brotherhood and silence, passed  between the two men.    ""Can I borrow the dog?""    The man replied, ""Get in line."""
