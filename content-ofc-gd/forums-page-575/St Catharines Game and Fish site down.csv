551303,chilli,2011-02-14 03:25:00,199,The St Catharines game and fish site is only down due to the domain name hosting but can still be viewed by going to http://scgameandfish.proboards.com/  If your bookmark is scgameandfish.net it will not open. We'll have this corrected as soon as possible. If you hear of anyone who can't open the site please suggest they add the dot proboards to the url to get in for now.  Thank you scgameandfish Admin
