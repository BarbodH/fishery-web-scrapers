543001,[email protected],2011-01-24 03:22:00,57,  That's great Vince! They sound like great kids. Look forward to meeting them. Thanks again.  Elisa
543057,ravinerat,2011-01-24 16:24:00,64,I am working night shifts but will try to make it. A great event.  RR
547593,vinnimon,2011-02-04 04:12:00,2593,   They will keep you entertainted all day Elisa. AND i MEAN ALL DAY  Pure chatter boxes But they dont hesitate to help out.
547601,camillj,2011-02-04 04:41:00,1988,OK .. sort of a good news bad news thing for me ... either a) I can't be there because I have to be in Vegas the next day ... in which case I could donate a pair of Tickets to the Leafs Game that night (against Pittsburg) ... for silent auction type thing... OR ... I will be there because I ditch the Vegas obligation ... but then I keep the tickets ... and donate cash ... either way count me for $100 - just let me know where to send it  TJQ let me know if you want some help around the BBQ ...or if I should charge the batteries on the Humminbird  I guess its kind of a win win really
547709,e-z-out,2011-02-04 16:33:00,1052,Think we should pin this one up TJ its getting closer and I can't wait. Hope to see all of you guys again this year.

548719,TJQ,2011-02-07 18:51:00,7806,Just got a box of stuff (including an autographed reel) from Dave Mercer for the live auction at the end of the event!!!
548739,skeeter,2011-02-07 19:36:00,1907,TJ you still havent fixed this yet-- * A fishing license is required for those between 16 and 65 years of age.*  
548752,Governator,2011-02-07 19:57:00,879,"Me and my buddy will be there!  Question, I'm assuming Innisfil will waive the parking fee?"
548767,d_paluch,2011-02-07 21:34:00,343,"Hey guys! For the fishing derby, is it near shore? Sorry I am new to all of this . I do not have a sled so I would have to walk. Want to be there but not 100% sure of schedule. I'll get back to yah!"
548768,Fisherman,2011-02-07 21:41:00,7201,"Yes it's within walking distance, within 1/2 km you can be in 70-80 FOW, the snow will be beate down by snowmobile travel in the area.  You can fish for the perch in a bit closer and whites a little further out."
548769,Fisherman,2011-02-07 21:42:00,7201,"They did last year, can't see why they wouldn't this year.  That would really make for sour cherries."

If you are a fan this is not to be missed. Besides it is for a good cause so the feel good factor is way up their too.   Art
549225,Fisherman,2011-02-09 01:09:00,7201,"I'd be a little leary of Brians offer, he just might ""flasher her"""

537648,Woodsman,2011-01-10 23:23:00,1286,"blairwelsh: It was posted in a proper place as the poster for the tournament stated ""* A fishing license is required for those between 16 and 65 years of age.*"" However you are correct that no licence is required for those below 18 years of age or over 65.(Canadian residents)  BTW: I'll do my best to make again this year. Always a good time. Does anyone know if Innisfil will be waiving the parking fee again this year for those in the event?"

537889,motv8tr,2011-01-11 12:34:00,2587,I'd like to thank everyone who has continued to be so supportive of Tyler and his family.  Who would have thought that what started so small 7 years ago would turn into something so spectacular.  Again thanks for the continued support.  Maureen
537919,Aaron Shirley,2011-01-11 14:10:00,655,I plan to be there as always. Looking forward to another great event

Whoever is taking care of the coffee and hot chocolate olease pm me and I'll see what I can do to help there."
538751,[email protected],2011-01-13 12:45:00,57,"Hi Everybody!  Thank you to TJ for getting me on here so I can answer some questions. Thank you to everyone for all their offers of prizes and help. The Town of Innisfil wanted us to have Tyler's fundraiser the same weekend they have Winterfest so badly they switched their weekend to ours! The next step for me is requesting to get the parking fee waived for out of town people. I will let you know how that goes. Starbucks will be supporting us again this year with coffee, hot chocolate and with many prizes. They usually provided the ""big"" prize. eg. last year was the fish smoker, two years ago was the fish finder.  Posca Foods has offered us hamburgers and hotdogs (personal childhood friend of mine). I haven't even sent out letters requesting help yet! I will be doing that today. I have Tyler home today so we will be wrestling for the computer. : )  I got a phone call last night from the gentleman who caught the biggest fish last year. He works at Bass Pro. He told me that his boss, Shaun Hewitt, wants me to call him and come in and see him ASAP. Apparently, Shaun has an autistic son as well.  We are hoping to have some silent auction items again this year.  Thanks everyone for your help. If you have any other questions please ask. You can also email me at [email protected].  Have a great day."
538753,asdve23rveavwa,2011-01-13 12:51:00,2690, Way to go Vince!!!
538824,mepps,2011-01-13 15:11:00,1301,"Cant make it, but I'll provide some prizes again!"
541195,vinnimon,2011-01-19 04:32:00,2593,  If anyone that is not attending and would like to donate prizes etc. I would gladly bring them up for you. That is if your in the hamilton area or guelph area. Pm me and we can make arrangements to meet up somehow. Im in the geulph area from tues to friday till 6pm. Hamilton otherwise! Sat thru Monday during the day im somewhere.  Cheers and good fishing to yas all
542421,Beans,2011-01-22 21:38:00,3339,"Just read this on Facebook:  So exciting!!! Driving into Alcona this afternoon (with Tyler) and right in front of Sobeys is a HUGE sign Winterfest Feb. 25,26,27 TYLER's FISHING DERBY is the main event!!!!!!!!!!!! Whoo Hoo!!!!!! Posted by Tyler's mom...  She also posted this on Facebook but I can't find the article she mentions...can anybody post it?  I sat down and opened up the Innisfil Examiner and there is an article about Tyler's Fishing Tournament!!! They rock!"
542574,[email protected],2011-01-23 02:52:00,57,"Hi Everyone,  Sorry I haven't been on to update lately, but I have been having trouble with Tyler for the past two weeks with him being suddenly afraid to go to high school. For the time being, I am keeping him home and trying to get him into a new high school. It is very difficult to find out what is bothering him but we are fearful that someone has hurt him or he has witnessed something that has tramatized him. The high school that I am trying to get him into is very excited to have him I just have to do some red tape stuff and hopefully he will be going to a new school in a couple of weeks. It is hard to plan the tournament when he is home and on the computer! I am hoping that this week I will be able to get my focus back on the tournament again.  There was an article in the Innisfil Examiner on Friday, January 21 on the second page under community listings. It has a picture of last year's winner and under the picture it says, Lake Simcoe features some of the best ice fishing in the world and so it's not a surprise the Annual Fishing for Tyler fishing derby on Saturday morning is a favourite part of Innisfil's Winterfest.  Then under Innisfil it says, Innisfil Wnterfest has a new date -- February 25, 26 and 27, three days of fun at the Innisfil Beach Park. Event includes the annual Fishing for Tyler fishing derby on Saturday morning, and then lists a  tyke hockey tournament  on Sunday and the polar bear dip.  I will try to get a hold of the manager from Bass Pro as I haven't heard from him yet. Maybe while Tyler is in transition between schools, Tyler and I can go down to Bass Pro and visit him : ).  Prizes are coming in and thank you so much everyone for helping."
