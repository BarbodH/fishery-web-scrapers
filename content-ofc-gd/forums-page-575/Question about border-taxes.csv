551723,smally21,2011-02-15 12:48:00,993,"just like crossing the border in yoiur vehicle, some cars get stopped and some dont. not all usps packages will get tagged for brokerage fees  - but all ups packages will be tagged. so sometimes i pay at the door for usps stuff, sometimes you dont, but it will always be less than ups, who i just wont use anymore.  the vendor is likely not responsible for any delays. nor are they responsible for any customs fees or duties. and beating up on them really isn`t fair. they are not holding your parcel, or charging you duty, or collecting hst.  the hit and miss part can be a little frustrating, and the fact that the odd package takes two weeks longer than a similar package is odd too.  it hasn`t been long enough to freak out yet, im going on 30 days for a package out of the states but its the odd one i guess.  good luck hope you get it soon and the brokerage fairy is kind to you."
551943,SlowPoke,2011-02-16 01:06:00,2984," This is not accurate. ""Brokerage"" is determining the class of goods and reporting to customs for shipment. When you cross the border in a vehicle and the goods belong to you AND ARE IN YOUR POSSESSION, you do not require a broker, you simply declare the goods and country of origin. When shipping an item, class of goods and origin will determine if the goods are eligible for entry into Canada and if duties and taxes will be applied. With USPS, you are charged a flat brokerage fee incorporated into the shipping price. When the package arrives at your door, you MAY be required to pay duty and taxes. With UPS, brokerage fees are over and above the shipping price. When the package comes to your door, you WILL pay brokerage fees and MAY pay applicable duties and taxes depending on the item value and whether or not is was declared gift/sample etc. To make matters more confusing, some companies will ship UPS but handle brokerage and applicable taxes themselves. Cabela's is a perfect example of this. No surprises at the door when the UPS guy hands over that Cabela's box."
552245,limeyangler,2011-02-16 21:08:00,5204,Thanks for all the replies folks.  it arrived yesterday in our post box...no extra charges!  Looked at the date stamp and they had not shipped till almost a week and a half after they took my order online.  I did speak to the guy who actually designed the product...really nice guy....he offered straight away to just send me another order by USPS if it turned out i was gonna get shafted...at no extra cost....ASAP.   I did say that i felt his quick responses and personal attention was great and he deserved a mention alone for the outstanding customer service.  Its basically a spare line tidier with a cutting edge...i just put it all on my spools that are forever unwinding in my tackle bag...AWESOME LITTLE INVENTION!  I dont know if i'm allowed to post the link so no hard feelings to the mods if they delete it...but it really is a cool little gizmo...and the customer service top notch so i feel it deserves a mention.  cool little gizmo link   Once again...thanks for all the replies and advice...OFC rocks!  Although the goods were shipped by USPS i did pass on to Rob(the designer/owner)the issues that can arise when using Fed-ex or UPS cross border.

551264,limeyangler,2011-02-14 02:19:00,5204,"Hi all,  Just wondering.....is there a $ threshold for paying taxes at the border when you buy something online and it is shipped from the states?  I bought some items....total $15. Its taken 3 weeks and still no parcel. I paid $20 shipping. I did hear something about UPS holding things up, something about 'brokerage'.....but am unsure what is happening.  Any ideas?  I have had some e-mails from the supplier(fishing related), but to be honest was a bit peed off with the latest reply, i wont go into it yet about what they are saying before i can get an idea of why the hold up might be happening.  I have paid way less shipping on much more expensive items on ebay and regular retail outlets from the U.S. and had it arrive within the week.....so i'm thinking its something to do with it not being sent by USPS and getting dinged by either UPS'brokerage' fees or the freekin' government wanting another slice of my ever diminishing pie....or both.   Whaddaya think folks?"
551265,Gregoire,2011-02-14 02:22:00,1397,Im my experience shipping with UPS or fedex is a mistake. Always go with the USPS.
551267,MJIG,2011-02-14 02:32:00,227," If they're coming UPS, you should be able to get a tracking number from the sender then go to www.ups.com enter it on the tracking page and find out exactly what is happening. I've watched things get scanned upon arrival in Canada, get shipped back across the border for brokerage, then back to Canada, then go back again...  UPS charges a fortune for brokerage fees and chances are it isn't included in that $20.00 shipping charge you already spent, and you'll get charged the additional brokerage fee C.O.D. upon delivery. Like fishgreg said, use USPS if your supplier offers the choice."
551270,limeyangler,2011-02-14 02:33:00,5204," Thanks for the quick reply Fishgreg....what are your experiences with ups and fedex...why is it not good to ship with them...if i can find out i can tell the retailer to use usps as they are saying its ""our government i should blame"" as this is happening 'with everything they send to Canada"""
551274,Bondar,2011-02-14 02:39:00,817,"I just ordered a $24.99 item from BassPro , buy the time it was said and done with duty , taxes border fees handle fees, it cost me near $80 through Fed EX , but i needed the item in a hurry so i had no choice !  Good Luck !!  Always USPS from the states !"
551277,irishfield,2011-02-14 02:45:00,26272,"Fedex only charges a $10 brokerage/handling fee + tax collection. USPS is $5 + tax collection.. UPS is a rolette wheel.. pick a number.. any number.. could be $70+ !  There is no duty if the product is made in the USA or Mexico... rarely do they catch anything as ""offshore"" shipping from the US that is made offshore.. and the only time duty is applied.. Usually under 7% if it happens."
551278,mercman,2011-02-14 02:47:00,7054,"I ordered some stuff from BPS.Took 3 weeks, cost 36 bucks shipping and found the same thing later in the le baron catalogue for 20 bucks cheaper. BPS is good, if you can go to a store, other than that, forget about it.Most companies make lots of prophet from shipping overcharges.  "
551281,okumasheffield,2011-02-14 02:59:00,318,aside from the courier choice ... canadian boarder tax always amazes me
551291,limeyangler,2011-02-14 03:09:00,5204,"  So if this is the case here....and i dont necessarily need this item...what are my ""choices"".....?  Do i just cut my losses and let them keep it and lose $37 instead of paying $80+ for $15 worth of goods?  Who the hell can i complain to about this? This is outrageous if its the case."
551294,irishfield,2011-02-14 03:10:00,26272,If it's UPS Simon.. they're probably waiting for you to call them and give them a Credit card number to cover the brokerage and tax collection. Do you  have at tracking number???
551301,Joey,2011-02-14 03:20:00,9122,"I make a note never to order anything from the States if it is shipped by UPS.  Some places will ship USPS if you ask, some will not.  I did ask UPS once what their brokerage charges were and it is a percentage of what the cost of the item is, plus a standard fee, plus taxes etc.  It is outrageous and I've been dinged a few times.  Learned my lesson the hard way.  When it arrives (it will eventually Simon) just pay the stupid fee and never have anything shipped UPS again.  Joey"
551302,limeyangler,2011-02-14 03:22:00,5204,  No Wayne i dont have the number..i have to contact the retailer and find out who they have used.  Thanks for the info/advice.
551304,limeyangler,2011-02-14 03:25:00,5204,"  Thanks Joey, yeah might just do that. Sucks...but whaddaya gonna do right?  I find it interesting though that the retailer sends me an email saying that all the stuff they send to Canada gets held up, yet has no explanation for the hold up or info about who is shipping and/or extra charges customers may be liable for.  Not right if ya ask me."
551306,irishfield,2011-02-14 03:28:00,26272,Actually sounds like they're stalling on their part Simon... the border has been pretty slick lately. Me shipping to Florida in 2 days in recent weeks...and North bound in less than 5 for items I've ordered from various places.
551307,manitoubass2,2011-02-14 03:28:00,11391,"another thing to factor in here is, alot of ontario parcels coming from the Us will actually be shipped to a port, like BC first. When that happens it usually adds a few weeks to the delivery. However, if a parcel is brokered, that shouldnt be the case at all.  limey, if you ever really need something in a pinch from the states, hit me up. I was born in international falls MN and have a mailbox on that side. Shipping usually only takes 2-3 days that way, then another day from Fort Frances to Dryden"

551326,Gregoire,2011-02-14 04:24:00,1397,I would have to agree with slowpoke on this one. Cover your butt and be prepared to make a claim with paypal and ebay.
551344,blizzcat,2011-02-14 07:06:00,92,"""Brokerage fee"" is other words for they bring a manifest into Customs with a few hundred items on it and get it stamped. If you're shipping international and you have an option to clear customs yourself (and you live in driving distance to Pearson airport) it's cheaper to just do it yourself. You declare it, bring a copy of the receipt, and pay taxes. The brokerage fee is because the shipping company is clearing it with customs on your behalf. (I've heard it can be up to 70-80 bucks but I think  it depends on the weight of the item, and who is shipping it)  Also sometimes it may take longer if customs needs to examine it.. so I would find a tracking number and call someone to get the status of the shipment. Good luck!"
551369,limeyangler,2011-02-14 14:12:00,5204,"  NOW HE TELLS ME!!!  Thanks man...i will definitely use MBPS in future!  I'm gonna contact them this morning and find out a tracking number.  Thanks for all the replies/advice....good to know for the future.  This was not an Ebay/paypall ourchase so complaining that way is not an option, neither is collecting from Pearson...i'm a little bit far away for that, although the drive down along the coast of Lake Superior is beautiful  I'll let you all know the result of this...who knows...it might just be taking a while and turn up at no extra cost....doubt it though."
551716,outllaw,2011-02-15 11:45:00,1232,"sadly. the goverments have tweeked the industrys to become taxation agents. brokerage is apaperwork goldmine for the brokerage firms. unless i can not purchase the product in canada,and only then will i be held hostage. how is it you can take shipments from asia, not be gouged but get gouged from u.s. shippers.since 9-11 brokerage,shipping,and taxations have been forefronted.these procedures have been killing trade between north-americans..we try to ship thru the mail services it is slower but, cheeper."
551717,bucketmouthjohnny,2011-02-15 11:58:00,115,"Everyone is right on about UPS and FEdEx. If it gets delivered (this has happened to me)and if there is a price tag you have to pay to receive it, just say you don't want it and return to sender. Than you need to inquire about a refund, but I wouldn't throw even $10 more on top of $20 shipping to receive a product. The store should know shipping policies and thus should refund your money without prejudice upon receiving their goods back. I bought $60 worth of fishing stuff two weeks ago, $18 shipped via USPS, had it within 7 days, no charges!!Of course the order was wrong and two products were defective   Hope everything goes well for you?!!!"
551718,solopaddler,2011-02-15 12:08:00,8605,"Over the last month or so I've placed at least a dozen orders online for stuff from the States. Most shipped via USPS, some UPS.  I've received everything within a week. Something's definitely not right waiting that length of time.  Beyond the ridiculous fees UPS charges, what's really annoying is they don't accept cash when delivered to your door.  I had a UPS delivery last week with a $5.85 charge that I was forced to put on my credit card. What if someone doesn't have a credit card?"
551719,SlowPoke,2011-02-15 12:14:00,2984,They probably wouldn't be shopping online. UPS drivers accepting cash would be too much of a target for thieves.
551721,solopaddler,2011-02-15 12:26:00,8605,  Wiseguy  .   Every other delivery service accepts cash.
