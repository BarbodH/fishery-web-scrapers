They will be covering all aspects of walleye fishing. If u ever wanted to know how to troll for walleye, jig them up, get them through the ice... this is the seminar to see! it will be held on the Sufix stage, friday at 3:30, saturday, sunday and monday all at 1:45pm.  hope to see lots of guys out at the show this weekend!"
