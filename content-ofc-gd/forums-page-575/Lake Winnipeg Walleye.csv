551882,troutologist,2011-02-15 23:55:00,951,"On large, somewhat featureless lakes like Lake Winnipeg finding fish can be tough,sometimes you need to call them to you. Fish are roaming massive flats searching for smelt and shiners, I can imagine similar situations exist in the Great Lakes and other lakes seeing walleye spread widely in search of food.  Ripping lipless cranks like the Live Target Golden Shiner proves to be an effective way to call fish to you and illicit some vicious strikes. This tactic will bring a lot of lookers in on your flasher, so it is important to have a small spoon like a 1/4oz Buckshot or small Lindy Darter ready on a second rod. Sometimes tipping these baits with a minnow head makes all the difference.  "

552135,johnnyb,2011-02-16 15:30:00,3413,That is a doozy...nice work.  I've read more than a couple articles describing that technique in the last couple of years...and you've proven it works
552172,camillj,2011-02-16 17:45:00,1988,Yep .. lots of times the hit come on the OTHER line when getting a little aggressive .... and it is always fun to see them cruise BACK for a second look .. then it actually feels like you are fishing .. not just watching
