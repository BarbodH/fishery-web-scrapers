552024,mike rousseau,2011-02-16 03:27:00,4661,well... its been some hard work this year getting to my favorite walleye spot but i decided to put in the extra effort...  and...   success!  only 4 trips out i managed 10 walleye including two 8 pounders and this massive 10 pounder...
552025,manitoubass2,2011-02-16 03:31:00,11391,"Nice fish, great catch!  Around here anything 10lbs + is called a cowbeena, and they sure are fun to catch"
552026,hammercarp,2011-02-16 03:35:00,964,Nice.
552028,manitoubass2,2011-02-16 03:37:00,11391,"What was the length? Looks fairly short, but very good girth"
552037,mike rousseau,2011-02-16 03:55:00,4661,  looks short cause im 6 foot 4  270lbs...  it was over 30 inches... we didnt have a scale but any walleye that fat over 30 inches is definatly over 10 pounds
552038,manitoubass2,2011-02-16 03:57:00,11391," I wasn't calling you out or anything, it just looks short and stocky. If your that big though, lol, that explains it.  I agree, if it was over 30"" and that nice girth, I'd say closer to 11lbs than 10lbs. Again, great fish!"
552039,mike rousseau,2011-02-16 04:00:00,4661,  thanks.... im carefull not to ... stretch... the truth  i usualy undercut my fish if anything...
