Already looking for skuds,now Banjo's.Whatever works I guess."

837046,aplumma,2014-02-18 22:20:00,6896,The banjo lure are very productive as far as attracting fish but so is a senco. The down fall of the banjo is it has the hook hooked to the lip of the bait so unless the fish gets all of the bait or the front half of the bait you can get a hook up. I have fished them and watched a lot of strikes fall short of the hook but hey the strike is the best part of a catch sometimes.  Art
