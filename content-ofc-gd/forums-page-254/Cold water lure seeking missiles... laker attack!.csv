Very thick fish that gave me a great scrap on a medium light rod I had borrowed - thanks Andrew! Good thing he brought extra rods... because in my haste that morning I left my entire rod case at home LMAO! I love the darker colour on many of the fish this year, anyone have theories why? Diet? Location? Somebody told me it is because they didn't spawn in the fall?                    "

836578,Gregoire,2014-02-16 01:15:00,1397,Some nice fish in that report. Your ability to fill in the blanks before the real fishing season starts is impressive.
836646,fish_fishburn,2014-02-16 16:18:00,1311,"Those are some nice ones, Thanks Pete. Some of the darker fish might be the photo is a bit underexposed. Remember, the sun over your shoulder rule, when possible.No"
836658,Fisherpete,2014-02-16 18:52:00,1814,"No, these fish were really dark compared to most of the ones I caught last year... same for my buddies. Their backs were almost black instead of grey/silver. Here's one with the typical colours from last year:  "
837009,Lunkerhunter,2014-02-18 17:12:00,455,not just the photo or filter. definetely some darker fish for whatever reason
837106,MJL,2014-02-19 02:23:00,2427,"Nicely done Pete!  After taking up ice fishing 5yrs ago, it's hard not to think about chasing lakers all winter - I enjoy it more than winter/spring steelhead now. Eyes glued to the sonar waiting for that rocket to appear"
837114,bassfighter,2014-02-19 03:07:00,366,Great catch guys!  How heavy was that yellow rattler? How long does that take to get down below?
