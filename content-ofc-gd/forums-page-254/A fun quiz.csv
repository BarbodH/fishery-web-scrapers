837248,blaque,2014-02-19 20:51:00,2419,"Meh, 97.5%..........think the mountain vs lake whitefish may have gotten me a time or two  Edit: 97.5 is one incorrect answer, so it got me once lol"
837255,BillM,2014-02-19 21:02:00,17367,Mountain whitefish got me a few times.
837256,Christopheraaron,2014-02-19 21:02:00,3525,Ya that was my score the first time as well.
837260,Joeytier,2014-02-19 21:24:00,3990,95...the juvenile whitefish was tough
837261,craigdritchie,2014-02-19 21:27:00,1586,40/40. That was really easy. It would have been fun to include more juveniles and parr.
837263,Christopheraaron,2014-02-19 21:41:00,3525,"I was wondering if they would have included tigers, cutbows, goldens, etc.."
837271,blaque,2014-02-19 21:58:00,2419,"And not one Palamino,.... i am glad however they didnt include the Trouser?"
837276,Spiel,2014-02-19 22:21:00,9065,40/40. That was really easy. It would have been fun to include more juveniles and parr.   Same here (40/40). Totally agree with the juvenile/parr comment. That would definitely toughen it up.
837277,bare foot wader,2014-02-19 22:23:00,1354,"kind of easy, but it helps when you catch these fish year round...they should have included some bull trout vs dolly varden pics to make it really tough"
837279,solopaddler,2014-02-19 22:31:00,8605,40/40. That was really easy. It would have been fun to include more juveniles and parr.  Smarty pants.  For a real curve ball how about some juvenile Atlantics?
837282,highdrifter,2014-02-19 22:41:00,2534,Cool!  I got that funny looking brookie wrong...  Throw in some cyprinidae and then things would get interesting!  Thanks for that.
837294,Roy,2014-02-19 23:33:00,13728,"40/40 here. Dumb luck I guess. I was thinking the same thing, Mike. Another one could be the whole bass/crappie family...that could stump a lot of people, especially me."
837296,Acountdeleted,2014-02-19 23:35:00,2562,This was a lot of fun. Thanks for the quiz. I got 2 wrong. Crazy Bull Trout.  What province was this test for again?  Passing this around the office. Hopefully I'm not the only one that gets confused on a few of em.
837299,Christopheraaron,2014-02-19 23:48:00,3525,"Head office is Calgary, that's also where they do most of their work."
837303,MJL,2014-02-20 00:05:00,2427,40/40 yay!  I still haven't caught a lake whitefish or arctic grayling though
