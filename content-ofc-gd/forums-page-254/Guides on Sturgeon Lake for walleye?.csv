836854,Big Cliff,2014-02-17 17:14:00,6899,"I would be interested in knowing who if anyone intends to guide on Sturgeon Lake in the 2014 season (speciffically for walleye). What your rates are for the day and were do you launch out of. Also, the style of fishing (trolling, jigging.......) When you intend to start, when do you move off to other bodies of water or species? Any other information you care to share with me. I might have some business for you!    "

836986,MSBruno,2014-02-18 14:03:00,369,Greg Klatt at ProFISH'nt Angling Services .... hands down.  I've used him twice and he's put us on fish (trophies) when other couldn't catch dinks.
