837005,manjo39,2014-02-18 16:57:00,354,"I like the smelt for jerkbaiting, but I find the finish comes off too easy when the trebles rub.  It catches fish though. Frogs are excellent as mentioned. I also have the bluegill crankbait, but have more confidence in the smelt. They all cast well."
837007,lookinforwalleye,2014-02-18 17:05:00,4399,"I hate how expensive lures are getting....especially when they actually do work well, because I always seem to lose the most expensive lures while shore fishing Lake O.  Pisses me off...and its always like the second or third cast.... I hear you on that, I bought a live target craw a couple years ago and first cast on Simcoe the braid snapped and the craw was on it`s way to god knows where!!!"
837020,Steve,2014-02-18 18:43:00,2075,"Live Target lures ..... what can be said.  You are buying an expensive lure without adequate split rings or hooks.  if you look at megabass, yozuri, lucky craft, etc, you will see they use top end split rings and hooks.  as dwc said, it sucks watching a mid size fish (10lbs brown, bow, etc) destroy a treble hook.  god forbid you use them for salmon.  AND the reps at the fishing show represent their smelt baits for sping king baits....when doing so, I ask if the hooks and split rings are satisfactory for spring kings --- all I get is a dumb look back at me."
837024,BillM,2014-02-18 19:19:00,17367,"If I'm going to spend that kind of $$$ on a lure, it will be a LC, Duo, etc etc."

If I dont know what I did to make it not work, thats brutal IMO ....either theres something wrong with me or the lures, Im having a tough time wondering sometimes..... I must say though, I am pretty happy that I didnt have hook and split ring failures like other people have experienced, and Ive caught some decent browns and pike etc.  I would lose it if it happened......"

837038,Rich Nelson,2014-02-18 21:14:00,332,"Which models of Live Target did you have crack and take on water? I have beat up a few of mine pretty good, and the bodies and paint hold up very well."
837070,Steve,2014-02-19 00:09:00,2075,"if you are looking for a lure that holds up, right out of the package, in all seasons, for all species, look no further than YOZURI / DUEL (same company).  i have not had a live target lure ""crack"", but I had the eye fall off one, lol.  i've bent treble hooks and taco'd split rings on them however.  for the cost of the lure, you'd think they would put on real hardware. the livetarget rep/promotional staff on bfb ignored me when I asked about the hardware used on their new ""baitball"" series of lures."
837071,Steve,2014-02-19 00:10:00,2075,"oh, try and find out who makes the hooks on their frogs....  ever try to sharpen one of the frog hooks? very very high carbon ... makes it very difficult to sharpen....  that is because they are cheap hooks (higher carbon hooks break, not bend, and cannot be sharpened).  too bad because i'd love to support Grant Koppers....good ole Canadian."

I have a brand new 5 year old or so frog still in the box. It was a gift and I use rods I've paid less for at yard sales. Actually pretty good rods. I would lose it if I lost that lure. So there it sits, appreciating in value."
837074,chris.brock,2014-02-19 00:21:00,4053,"my wife loves the frogs, mainly because she can fire them right into the alders and then twitch them out without getting hung up (Haha)  I'm probably not the most technical fisherman, although I believe in patterning the fish each day, some of these new baits are designed to catch the consumer not the fish"
837075,Roy,2014-02-19 00:25:00,13728,"Grant Koppers is a member of this community. If you PM him, I'm sure he could answer all of your questions. Maybe point him to this thread. In a week, he'll have been here 4 years."

Took on water early, I mean 8hours early, happened at least three times Xrap same deal,  but more than 3 Target....perch model, can't confirm exactly, but 1 at least.  After a while u get pissed.  Call me a liar, I know what a malfunction is.  I usually buy everything in bulk...bad batch, maybe I don't know.  I know what happened though.  I've got a buddy who used the same LCp for over 5yr, no probs.  but I have had problems.  I still buy em all, but ishhh happens no doubt.  And sadly I know all too well about casting off my favs every season!  *******not to say no longer use these due to malfunction.....because i still actually RELY on them!!!****"
837146,Moosebunk,2014-02-19 08:20:00,3970,"Live Target... weren't they like last years Jackalls but both destined to one day go the way of the incredible Cotton Cordell Divers?  Will in 5 years their costs not likely be cut nearly in half, and if they last 10 years they not likely be in $4.89 bargain bins at BPS & Sail?  Rarely spend $15 on any lure... maybe a Rapala of sorts about that price... A Yozi too pushing around $12.  But not much else...  only time the big bucks come out is when buying sweet sweet muskie lures.  Can't believe some of these tiny pieces of conveyor belt plastic are selling for nearly as much as some hand-crafted big baits."
837396,NAC,2014-02-20 18:02:00,369,"I agree with the comment of the hardware on the smaller smelts, however, I own multiple of almost every freshwater LT made.  I think they are by far the best lure manufactured at that price point.  I have done very well with every single lure I own from them.  Would not trade them for anything. Have purged all similar hard baits by other manufacturers several years ago.  Everyone has their favourites, and I have about a dozen.  They are all Live Target."
837400,mepps,2014-02-20 18:31:00,1301,"Solid lures for sure! I've been loving their top water mouse lures especially. Pike and bass love em, but they aren't the most durable.  http://www.livetargetlures.com/products/freshwater/field_mouse.php"
837410,Old Ironmaker,2014-02-20 19:14:00,8243,"I know this might sound crazy, but has anyone ever used a live mouse fishing. I don't know what the regs are when it comes to using live mammals for bait. They're not little cuddly pets they're vermin. There sure are enough of them around. I've heard the stories over the years about using kittens or Gerbils ( pet vermin) for Musky. I would like to think the kitten thing is an urban legend but there's someone out there sick enough I'm sure.  If you don't want to admit to it just say ""I know this guy that,,,,,,,,,,"".  For all the Gerbil owners, sorry I think they are fat rats in a cage, I can't tell the difference. Canada girls just made it 2-1, USA."
837416,buick14,2014-02-20 19:29:00,741,"I know this guy that.......  Ive heard some ppl ""claim"" to use kittens for musky bait.....attention seekers, kind of like ""those"" ppl sexually attracted to fire type deal.  Its easy to tell; all you have to do is talk to somebody who has the plague, elbow nudge him, then ask how the fishing's treating him.  You'll get your answer real fast!"
836886,captpierre,2014-02-17 21:13:00,2521,"Just came back from the fishing show.  Wondering if these lures are worth their extra expense.  Perch, and sunfish styles look pretty good to this fisherman.  But do the fish like them."
836890,mike rousseau,2014-02-17 21:33:00,4661,The perch ones work... But no better then the other popular deep crank... Tested against a perch taildancer... It was about even...
836892,kickingfrog,2014-02-17 21:44:00,8333,Sure they workâ€¦ Anglers have been buying them for years.  Seriously they are a quality lure that are comparable price-wise to other name brand cranks. They might be more detailed then necessary for most situations but in clear water that might just be the difference that's puts a fish on the line.
836894,sauce,2014-02-17 22:01:00,219,I'm a big fan of the #8 smelt for night eyes. Also really like the medium size 3-5 ft craw for bass in rivers. The price is worth it in my opinion. The finish on the lures holds up well compared to most other baits I use. My only complaint is that they don't make a perch pattern smelt. Xraps and husky jerks in perch have been a big part of my arsenal for the last few years.  To me the live target perch is inferior. Put stripes and a bit of green and orange on a smelt and live target will have another winner.
836895,davey buoy,2014-02-17 22:03:00,5505,"I've had good luck with the blue gill,dark crawfish and of coarse the green with yellow frog.The frog in my opinion is worth every cent.The other two catch no more than my cotton cordell crank bait collection.I also agree that the detail may be a little more then really needed at times."
836903,Acountdeleted,2014-02-17 22:23:00,2562,The new 'frog popper' they came out with is Money. When I was out over the summer I had pike fighting over it.
836906,dwc67,2014-02-17 22:34:00,140,upgrade the hooks on the smaller smelts they wont take big fish. it hurts seeing a 10 lb plus brown get off becuse the hooks straightened. looking forward to trying the jointed smelts this year.
836911,aplumma,2014-02-17 22:42:00,6896,live target mouse and frogs are the cats meow it is the first bait I throw in the morning or evening for bass.   Art
836919,Christopheraaron,2014-02-17 22:50:00,3525,"Never had much luck with the deep divers but don't fish them much anyways, the frogs are absolutely amazing though!"
836925,Lape0019,2014-02-17 23:42:00,647,Love their frogs. I only have them for regular frogs and the spro ones for poppers. I have a few lipless cranks that seem to catch more fisherman than fish but I haven't used it a lot. The attention to detail in their baits is second to none though and I do beleive they are worth the money. Their new bait all series look interesting as well.
836926,Tim Mills,2014-02-17 23:54:00,476,I was in Burns Fishing in Burlington last summer looking for a lure that would swim shallow and go over the top of weeds.  He suggested I try the Live Target Jointed Pumpkinseed.  It runs at 0-1' ft and leaves a wake. I used it 3 times last year.  I caught SM bass at the Niagara Glen with it and Pike at the local reservoir. The 3rd time using it I was  trolling with 2 rods and hooked up with the other rod.  I left it in the water while I reeled in the other rod. When I went to reel it in there was nothing on the end of my line.  There not small it must have been a decent sized fish. Should have been using a leader. I'm cheap and can't afford a tackle box full of Live Targets but its worth having a couple of them.  I bought 2 today- $19.99 each.    
836927,BillsTheBassMan,2014-02-18 00:13:00,932,"If you think these are expensive search Megabass lures.....yikes.  Live target Musky stuff seems good.  As far as bass/Pike/eyes jerks and cranks I prefer Rapala Xraps, and you can get them for under $5 a unit online."
836929,aplumma,2014-02-18 00:20:00,6896,Yea stinkin T.J. introduced me to megabass and my wallet has never been the same.   Art
836932,kickingfrog,2014-02-18 00:32:00,8333,"Funny how we all have our price point. Livetarget is about my max price wise, but if I'm buying a lure that I deem ""bass specific"" my price point comes down. I guess I don't see bass being as finicky or tough to catch as walleye or trout. (Not saying I'm right, just the way I feel)"
836933,Tim Mills,2014-02-18 00:34:00,476,Agree Art. After watching JP's old show I thought I would go to Fishing World and pick up a couple of the Mega Bass lures he was using.  When I saw the price I passed.
836934,aplumma,2014-02-18 00:42:00,6896,Glad one of us didn't fall for it. lol They are good lures but I think that the megabass topwater is dead even with the live target mouse. The action of the mouse is as slick as a buttered saddle.   Art
836938,NewHips,2014-02-18 01:24:00,111,Used the frogs.............Pike love em.................
836944,fishdawg,2014-02-18 01:53:00,912,"Banana Smelts are one of my faves now. I am also looking forward to the new jointed models. Musky guys, have you seen the various new Sucker models that are now out? The new Bait ball series is quite the concept... jerk bait model is gonna be HOT!"
836945,Happy Hooker,2014-02-18 02:01:00,9,"Yea saw the Muskie suckers at the show, look good and price point was there with many other Muskie lures, $20 - $28 depending on size. Finish was nice too but perhaps even less of a concern with Muskie."
836949,Rich Nelson,2014-02-18 02:18:00,332,"The Golden shiner lipless bait is gold. Catches many different species, and even works great jigging through the ice for Eyes and Lakers.  Lipless crappie is great as well."
836972,porkpie,2014-02-18 07:52:00,2521,"I hear ya,  I won't hardly part with $10 a lure for standard plugs, $20 is a big stretch, but if something really caught my eye I suppose I'd do it, but not a bass lure, bass is a budget affair, they will eat just about anything in my experience!"
836973,fishindevil,2014-02-18 08:51:00,6254,The frogs are great !!!! And the smelt deep diver for walleyes !!!! Have not tried the top water mouse yet but I will this year !!!! They are worth it in my opinion !!! Tight-lines

836997,JoshS,2014-02-18 16:02:00,729,"I've only really used the smelt and lipless rattle bait with success. Both are pretty good. I like the bigger smelt for pike sometimes and walleye. The little smelt was a good bait for night time eyes in some pressured waters when used like a jerkbait, I put a bit of splitshot on to get it down and it gets hit sometimes when nothing else does.  I've trolled the large deep diving perch for big pike with no success, but sure it has it's place. My buddy used it in my boat for musky a few times and think it got bit once."
836998,buick14,2014-02-18 16:14:00,741,"I hate how expensive lures are getting....especially when they actually do work well, because I always seem to lose the most expensive lures while shore fishing Lake O.  Pisses me off...and its always like the second or third cast...."
