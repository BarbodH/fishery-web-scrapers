837711,fish_fishburn,2014-02-22 03:20:00,1311,I have the Arctyrex by far the best I have ever used. a bit spendy but worth it after you get over the sticker shock.
835998,BassMan11,2014-02-12 18:56:00,583,"Hello Folks,  I am in the market for a new rain jacket. Looking for a light weight hard shell that will keep me dry in most rain conditions in all seasons. Looks to spend about $150. Any input would be great.  thanks, "
836000,BillM,2014-02-12 19:01:00,17367,Keep and eye open for when the Cabelas Guidewear stuff goes on sale.
836016,bigugli,2014-02-12 20:01:00,6138,"To date, I have yet to find a suit or shell that keeps me dry. Best suit I bought was a little over $200 at MEC some years back. Did a great job keeping out the rain. Just was not breathable enough. I always end up soaking wet no matter what I wear."
836018,BassMan11,2014-02-12 20:07:00,583,"That seems to be the general consensus... I find it odd when you read reviews on certain items how one person can say it never leaked once, and another can say it never kept me dry?"
836020,SirCranksalot,2014-02-12 20:10:00,3291,". I always end up soaking wet no matter what I wear.  I've never found a raincoat that could really 'breathe'---even real Goretex(not imitations). So I get wet from the inside from my sweat, which is better than getting soaked in a cold rain."
836022,fishing n autograph,2014-02-12 20:15:00,2540,I bought a rain suit from an army surplus place for $9 and has kept me dry better than anything other than my cascade suit from work
836028,porkpie,2014-02-12 20:40:00,2521,"I've had all kinds, best I've found is cabelas gear.  Either their gore tex, followed up closely by the dry plus.  No suit is perfect, but the cabelas stuff would probably suit your budget!"
836035,lookinforwalleye,2014-02-12 21:09:00,4399,BPS has rain gear on sale now!
836063,Garnet,2014-02-12 23:11:00,2056,I have Cabelas Guide Wear. Definitely dry just terrible in 70 mph bass boat. The hood parachutes nearly choking you.  Should have spend the money on 100mph BPS.
836065,aplumma,2014-02-12 23:18:00,6896,If you turn the hood inside out it will cut down on the being choked feeling.   Art
836066,grizzlybri,2014-02-12 23:26:00,565,I buy the Viking brand at marks work warehouse and they offer ones were you can hide the hood into the collar
836073,danc,2014-02-13 00:50:00,4677,I buy the Viking brand at marks work warehouse and they offer ones were you can hide the hood into the collar Happy with my Viking too.
836128,moemoe,2014-02-13 06:24:00,352,"bought the cabelas guidewear on sale based on the advice here and love it, biggest regret was not splurging on the bibs too"
836158,Garnet,2014-02-13 13:04:00,2056,Turning the hood inside out wouldn't work I'm wearing it. Rain hurts at 70+ so it's done up.  In more ordinary conditions I would recommended Cabelas Guide Wear.  The Bass Pro 100mph doesn't do hood parachute just from watching my buddys that own them.
836160,lew,2014-02-13 13:11:00,12766,"I use the BPS Goretex jacket & bibs and have always been happy with it. Can't recall the model but it's below the 100 MPH suit.  Even wear it over some fleece in the winter when using the snowblower as it's light, great for blocking the cold wind and keeps the blowing snow off me."
836164,Joey,2014-02-13 13:40:00,9122,I love my BPS Pro Qualifier Rain jacket and pants.  Got them on sale many years ago and they are still in great shape and keep me dry.
836168,BillM,2014-02-13 13:57:00,17367,Turning the hood inside out wouldn't work I'm wearing it. Rain hurts at 70+ so it's done up.  In more ordinary conditions I would recommended Cabelas Guide Wear.  The Bass Pro 100mph doesn't do hood parachute just from watching my buddys that own them.  If you're doing 70mph in the rain out in the open (ie not behind a windscreen) get some snow googles.  They'll stop you from being blasted in the face and will keep your hood from choking you
836183,adempsey,2014-02-13 15:09:00,1498,"The Cabelas and BPS suits are probably the most popular, but Frabill seems to be a good choice too.   Although, I am not sure what you can use for all four seasons.   I guess it depends on where you fish in the winter"
836184,Fisherman,2014-02-13 15:25:00,7201,"I've had my BPro 2 piece rainsuit for about 6 years now, I have no complaints. I've been in some pretty wicked downpours on GBay, dry inside and no sweating even the the summer warmth."
836204,Sinker,2014-02-13 16:15:00,8692,"I got a dakota jacket and bibs 2 years ago and love them. I got them more for work, as they are built tough, but I find myself wearing them more and more. I've been wearing them all winter so far at work. They breath really, really well, and so far I've been dry. No complaints from me at all.  S."
836211,Squid,2014-02-13 17:04:00,1656,The Cabelas rainsuits are definitley the better quality. There is a fall sale where you can buy the bibs and jacket for 50% off and that is a great deal. I paid 200 taxes in for my bib and jacket where it wouyld have cost me over 400 dollars regular.
836227,aplumma,2014-02-13 19:07:00,6896,If I am running the ranger  I usually have a helmet and face shield with the hood tucked in. I also have used the neoprene faces from motorcycle riding.    Art
836283,jimmy v,2014-02-14 00:49:00,33,Helly-Hansen makes an awesome suit I use that one in warmer weather-never a problem.Switch to Cabelas in late fall and early spring.
837590,Dan668,2014-02-21 15:29:00,1120,Are these coats usable in the summer or will they be to hot. Looking at the 100mph or pro q for the upcoming season.
837673,Gerritt,2014-02-21 23:13:00,6129,"Im really loving my US Navy Issue Gortex jacket.. I would reccomend to anyone looking for a waterproof jacket, seems to breathe well to boot! It is a great looking jacket that alot of folks have commented on.  G"
