Just wanted to say hi (again).  I'm in the process of buying my first fishing boat and found a number of the older threads extremely helpful.  This forum is a great resource.  I'm in the Grey-Bruce region.  I fish mostly inland lakes for bass and I do some stream fishing for trout as well.  Will be getting into the big water fishing once I have my boat.  Anyone in the area, feel free to drop me a line.  Always looking for fishing partners.  -Ben"
