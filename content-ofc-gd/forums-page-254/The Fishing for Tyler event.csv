836697,misfish,2014-02-16 21:03:00,29133," Pete thanks. As time has gone by,I have refined it. the black phantoms are my best work.  We drilled today with just mine. Ice is 28 inches today.   Burned 13 holes,then had to switch up batteries.  Im thinking with the 8"" fin bor,it will work just as good. Not as many holes,but atleast I wont have to drill side by sides or mickey mouse holes.  The wife likes it also. No fumes from an auger head in the condo."

833107,Big Cliff,2014-01-28 03:08:00,6899,I'll start it off at $25.00
828546,Big Cliff,2014-01-04 23:56:00,6899,"  I dont mean to stir the pot/or blow horns  here but,it was Spiel that started this whole G2G thing. Years before. Then passed it on to myself,as he couldnt always make it. Asked if there would be any objection to making it a fund raiser,we past it off gladly to Mo, for a great cause. From back when to now,it,s grown huge,and those that attend and donate is awesome.  Guess I better get busy making my normal donation of spud bars. Time will fly Im sure.  Dont forget yer helmet,and try to get that udder fella Beans to come with ya.   Sorry, I stand corrected! My first experience with it was when Mo started the first ever ""fishing for Tyler""! Didn't mean to step on anyones toes here."
828552,Woodsman,2014-01-05 00:43:00,1286,I also don't mean to stir the pot but I attended the advent a few times when Maureen (Motv8tr) ran it. Quite an enjoyable day each time. I attended once since the parents took over running it and it' was my last time. Poorly organized. I had the 3rd place whitefish but was never called to much later due to he forgot to look at a page of results.. But the worst infraction IMO was the constant parents claiming their children's prizes from the adult table without any control by the organizers.
828583,fishdawg,2014-01-05 02:54:00,912, I remember that 1st trip very well Brian and it was the 1st time many of us ever met each other. I used to have a bunch of pictures from that trip but my old computer self destructed and I lost them all.  Some good memories though and nice that the old tradition still continues on. x2 good times for sure cant forget Roger (Rizzo) pulling his gear out in the infamous pink Barbie sled
828585,Roy,2014-01-05 03:04:00,13728,"It's a charity event, it doesn't much matter who 'started' it. Maybe the few who are unhappy with an experience they may had there would be kind enough to offer their organizational skills. I'm sure it'd be appreciated. Let's all have a good time doing this for Tyler.  I'm not stirring the pot either."
828590,Pikeslayer,2014-01-05 03:22:00,1443,This is not a Tournament. It ain't about prizes (they're a nice bonus  ) It's all about Tyler & a great opportunity to meet like mined OFC'rs. Looking forward to a repeat visit  ps. I'll be putting up a summer LO Salmon/Bow trip for auction this year
828591,Loonietoon,2014-01-05 03:25:00,1450,Neither am I Roy I enjoy the fun of it all and I always end up at the grill with Big Cliff and Vinny and a few others helping out was I suppose to FISH someone forgot to tell me )
828594,Roy,2014-01-05 03:29:00,13728,Much appreciated Kelvin and all the rest of the gang helping out!
828633,Loonietoon,2014-01-05 14:55:00,1450,It is the least I can and besides this is where I have the most fun and meet all my friends that on ice I would miss
828845,icedude,2014-01-06 19:42:00,459,
828943,Old Ironmaker,2014-01-07 06:58:00,8243,Thanks all. You never know I'll get myself an Ontario Passport and may venture away from Erie.  Are there name tags? Then I can come disguised as someone nice. Maybe Christopher. I'll need to grow some more hair though.
828953,Fisherman,2014-01-07 12:31:00,7201,Ya have to wear your OFC hat.
829237,Freshtrax,2014-01-08 04:19:00,2215,"I like the name tag idea.   I've only met in person a few members from here. It feels weird when I'm at the event and I know I ""know"" a bunch of people but don't know who."
829678,[email protected],2014-01-10 03:06:00,57,"Hi everyone,  Just a quick post to let everyone know that I am hard at work getting the fundraiser up and running. Thank you to all who are jumping on the wagon to help it is very much appreciated.  I have a new hurdle this year in preparing for the tournament. I am required to fill an application to the town for PERMISSION and seek approval. I also have to provide insurance. I am also applying to have the parking waived again this year. All this and Tyler's sister and father have the flu and Tyler...well he is just Tyler. . Please know that I am doing my best and when I get confirmation I will let everyone know.  Please save the date!!!"
829686,Old Ironmaker,2014-01-10 03:56:00,8243,"I was actually serious about the name tags. It works well in all the conferences I've attended over the years. See the name recognize it as someone you've spent many hours talking to or corresponding with over the years but never met in person.  Are you reading this Mom? Send me a PM, I may be able to help in that way even if I don't attend if it's something you might want to do. Putting on the name tags is always optional. I don't think someone like Rob Ford would need one around Ontario at least."
829715,Fisherman,2014-01-10 12:03:00,7201,"For this effort, we have a lot of patience."
829763,Freshtrax,2014-01-10 17:10:00,2215,"Hey Tyler's mom,  if  it runs out to be unreadable to hold it at ibp.  Why not just have it on the ice down in gillford?  Hope all goes well."
829778,misfish,2014-01-10 19:06:00,29133,"Well if they give you a hard time,theres a big parking lot in Barrie and easy lake access. Like said,it,s about the fund raising not the fishing. Yes there is fish in the bay here.LOL"
829806,Hoppy,2014-01-10 22:00:00,95,"Hey Tyler's mom, if it runs out to be unreadable to hold it at ibp. Why not just have it on the ice down in gillford? Hope all goes well.  Gilford is in innisfil as well so the same permit is needed. Stupid new bylaw, you need to apply for a permit to have large family reunion or corn roast on your own property."

829887,[email protected],2014-01-11 03:24:00,57,"Let's see what happens. I have a lot of people in town that support this effort. I will take Tyler to visit the Mayor in her office if I have to. I will take him to the council meeting with his little sister, who is his biggest advocate and let them say no to them in person."
829889,[email protected],2014-01-11 03:42:00,57,"Yes Old Ironmaker, I am reading all messages.  We can do name tags not a problem."
829976,Loonietoon,2014-01-12 00:24:00,1450,I agree let them say no to Tyler then they can suck never mind

828473,Big Cliff,2014-01-04 17:52:00,6899,"Thanks Misfish, sounds like a very worthy cause. Who knows might actually get out of the county this winter. It sure is a very worth while cause! Maureen (Motv8tr) started the whole thing some 9 years ago and worked her tail off to put it all together! She rallied the troups, collected donations, aranged for food, washrooms, prizes and people to help with the running of it and getting donations. If it hadn't been for her this wonderful tradition probably would never have started.  From there it has grown over the years and Maureen had to back away from it a few years back because it was just too big for her to handle and and keep up with the requirements of her job and life but from those seeds that she planted it has become an event that many look forward too every year.  Many of us have had the pleasure of watching Tyler's progress over the years and knowing that our intervention has been a really big help to the family. Tyler's parents have continued where Maureen had to leave off and a wonderful tradition continues. The really big bonus for many of us was the friends we got to meet and the relationships that have formed. For me one of the bonuses has always beeing seeing Joey's beautiful smile!  If you haven't had the opportunity to share in this wonderful experience you are really missing out so if you can get involved this year would be a good time to do it!"
828484,misfish,2014-01-04 18:55:00,29133,"  I dont mean to stir the pot/or blow horns  here but,it was Spiel that started this whole G2G thing. Years before. Then passed it on to myself,as he couldnt always make it. Asked if there would be any objection to making it a fund raiser,we past it off gladly to Mo, for a great cause. From back when to now,it,s grown huge,and those that attend and donate is awesome.  Guess I better get busy making my normal donation of spud bars. Time will fly Im sure.  Dont forget yer helmet,and try to get that udder fella Beans to come with ya.  "

I remember that 1st trip very well Brian and it was the 1st time many of us ever met each other. I used to have a bunch of pictures from that trip but my old computer self destructed and I lost them all.  Some good memories though and nice that the old tradition still continues on."
