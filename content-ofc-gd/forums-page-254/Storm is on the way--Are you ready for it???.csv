837690,Old Ironmaker,2014-02-22 00:28:00,8243,"The flooding here on the shore of Lake Erie in Haldimand county has made the news on Hamilton Channel 11, it's just the beginning. I nearly killed myself walking 40 feet to the truck today. Dug an old pair of K2 ski poles from the 70's out and they sure are handy to negotiate this ice under 6"" or more of water. I told my wife I might need them even though I haven't skied in 35 years. We are getting gusts of 60K tonight off the lake, can't wait."
837701,moxie,2014-02-22 02:10:00,1566,Whew!!! That was close!!!
837732,Rod Caster,2014-02-22 09:53:00,5784,Whew!!! That was close!!! You need military relief???? How about government supplied grocery gift cards?
837744,SirCranksalot,2014-02-22 14:13:00,3291,"How about government supplied grocery gift cards?  Yeah, for food that spoils in the middle of a deep freeze!!!"
837504,npt1,2014-02-21 02:12:00,220,"With a storm warning issued by Enviroment Canada for some areas of Ontario tonight, Are you ready to deal with it? Tell us your hints and tips for a storm of this magnitude, high winds, heavy rain, possible power outages. Be safe everyone. npt1."
837508,bigugli,2014-02-21 02:43:00,6138,Might lose power 1-2 hours in West Niagara. We are getting some coloured lightning. No biggie.
837509,woodenboater,2014-02-21 02:44:00,2277,building my ark as we speak  but cleared the storm drain outside and tried to clear out pathway for runoff to go so as not to pool. not sure if that's in vain
837511,Pikeslayer,2014-02-21 02:59:00,1443,I just pored another drink
837514,John,2014-02-21 03:38:00,2956,Think I might pass on the water in my scotch
837517,moxie,2014-02-21 03:42:00,1566,Just like every other storm I've been through the 47 years I've walked this earth. It will pass.
837518,Old Ironmaker,2014-02-21 03:43:00,8243,That would just be another day here on the shore of Erie. Thunder and lightning during a calm snowfall is not normal. Have had a few claps and flashes this afternoon and tonight. Prepare? Getting the boat from storage for this thaw.
837525,BillM,2014-02-21 03:52:00,17367,"It is a wet sloppy mess outside, hopefully this cleans the driveway up a bit"
837534,woodenboater,2014-02-21 04:09:00,2277,been hearing thunder. sounds like it's taking a break but forecast is hellacious starting at midnight or so.
837548,fishing n autograph,2014-02-21 05:47:00,2540,I'm working in it. Lots of standing water in vaughan.
837553,Big Cliff,2014-02-21 11:21:00,6899,"Was West bound on 48 last night about 6:30 just out side of Beaverton. Car kept riding my tail so I pulled over and let it pass me. About 5 km further up the road I passed her again but she was upside down in the ditch. Stopped long enough to make sure she wasn't hurt, got her into another car that had stopped and left. Quite a mess to drive in, couldn't believe the number of people that wouldn't dim their lights (until I hit my Hi beams). Saw a couple of other cars in ditches but no serious accidents gladly.  Hope all of you were safe out there!"
837557,misfish,2014-02-21 11:53:00,29133,Parking lots are like ice rinks. Our side lot is a lake. I can just amagine what snow packed side roads are like. None travelable.
837558,Angler management,2014-02-21 11:58:00,280,Hopefully it doesnt mess up Simcoe for the weekend too bad!
837560,Big Cliff,2014-02-21 12:31:00,6899,"I have a feeling Simco is going to be nothing but slush for this Saturday, it is going to take a few days of cold weather for this to firm up."
837562,moxie,2014-02-21 12:48:00,1566,"Still breathing and the water here in Whitby hasn't gotten deeper than the soles of my shoes, yet.  Talking to a friend working in Toronto this morning and he assures me the city is still there. I suggested to him we might want to gather up the meteorologists and throw them into the same garbage bin along with politicians and lawyers since they're just about as useful, or should I say useless. He suggested we send them to the moon instead. Good Idea, or so I though since the weather on the moon hasn't varied much since the beginning of time but knowing the track record and their penchant for the doom and gloom hype they like to create figured they would be hard pressed not to screw it up there as well.  Besides, has anyone noticed the price of fuel lately? Better order another bin.  Stay safe remember to put one foot in front of the other folks. After all Meteorologists don't work for mother nature, they just report on her daily works of wonder."
837565,DanD,2014-02-21 12:55:00,2223,A bunch of pooled water here in my end of London. I slept through most of the storm. That's until this one big clap of thunder and my 90lb basset hound decides he's coming to sleep with me. I should say on top of me and every once of that 90lbs was shaking like a leaf.  Dan.
837575,SirCranksalot,2014-02-21 13:43:00,3291,"so, is he your guard dog??? A bunch of pooled water here in my end of London. I slept through most of the storm.

837577,DanD,2014-02-21 13:46:00,2223,LOL  The only thing he guards is his food dish.  Dan.
837579,Rod Caster,2014-02-21 13:49:00,5784,"Pretty nasty out, but beyond that it's nothing terrible up here. My 'dirt/snow/ice' road to the highway is gonna be JUUUUNK!"
837581,SirCranksalot,2014-02-21 14:08:00,3291,From the weather office	 	Warnings Barrie - Collingwood - Hillsdale 8:48 AM EST Friday 21 February 2014 Rainfall warning for Barrie - Collingwood - Hillsdale ended  ditto for the freezing rain warning
837592,lew,2014-02-21 15:50:00,12766,My 'dirt/snow/ice' road to the highway is gonna be JUUUUNK!  I just drove the 1 1/2 miles in on my dirt road and it's as bad as it'll ever get. Even in 4x4  I was sliding sideways coming up the hills. Anyone with rear wheel drive may as well just park out on the hiway and wait for springtime to arrive.
837593,kickingfrog,2014-02-21 16:00:00,8333,"Mask, snorkel and water wings. I'm ready."
837667,livinisfishin,2014-02-21 22:30:00,661,What do you think conditions will be like tomorrow? Slushy or solid?
837684,Rod Caster,2014-02-22 00:13:00,5784,Probably slushy. I drove on Callander Bay and it's wasn't too bad because the snow has been knocked down.  It's the wind I'm more worried about. 30k/hr sustained on Nipissing makes not for an enjoyable day. Apparently you Simcoe guys are a little more wind-weathered!
837689,livinisfishin,2014-02-22 00:27:00,661,Lol im not a simcoe guy. Hate the wind..but ill give 'er a shot.
