836762,Bernie,2014-02-17 01:25:00,3190,I rub my hands on the stainless steel sink in the kitchen. I find it works well.
836766,bigugli,2014-02-17 01:32:00,6138,Why??? I've never worried  about it. Beats some other household odours  Takes about a week to get rid of the cucumber smell after cleaning a couple thousand smelts
836790,Nipfisher,2014-02-17 04:35:00,2449,"Fish smell on my hands? Hmmmmmmm?  Nope,  never smelt it before."
836798,fishindevil,2014-02-17 08:22:00,6254,WD-40 works well and is also used as a fish attractant !!! So you will have both .... )
836800,Big Cliff,2014-02-17 10:37:00,6899,"There is a product called NokOut, that I have been using for years for hunting and fishing, it doesn't cover the scent, it eliminates it. Works on anything, I won't go into a big long explanation but ask any of the guys I have introduced it to.  http://www.nokout.com/home.php"
836801,GBW,2014-02-17 11:06:00,8460,"Yup, big Cliff is right.  I have since gone out and stocked up on NokOut after my test supply and its a very good product for many odors."

836813,bow slayer,2014-02-17 13:35:00,1074,"vinegar,stock up next trip into a macdonalds and keep the little packs in your boat or tackle bag.works on hands and cleaning the cutting board."
836825,Fisherpete,2014-02-17 14:20:00,1814,"lye, or any type of corrosive acid.  This, or you could just enlist the help of King Arthur. The Black Knight had no issues with fishy smell on his hands (or feet) after their encounter.  "
836829,manjo39,2014-02-17 14:56:00,354,"Also had this problem.  Most effective for me was the following: You need something gritty to get the smell off. If I am fishing a river/creek, reach into the river grab some gritty dirt off the bottom and rub all over your hands.  Rinse with water and the smell is gone. If I am fishing in a boat and no access to gritty dirt, then a hand cleaner with pumice works.  Canadian tire has Gojo with pumice or they have their own brand hand cleaner with pumice.  No more smell at all."

Fresh grounds straight from the can.  Powerful enough to even mask the smell of raw chicken flesh and blood that builds up in a reefer trailer.. We would spread a 1lb block inside a reefer trailer before loading it.
836855,moxie,2014-02-17 17:15:00,1566,Fish smell while fishing. Tough call. I do notice that if I don't go fishing that fish smell doesn't come into play at all.  Maybe its just me but getting that fish smell on me is one of the main reasons I go fishing.
837042,Wally,2014-02-18 21:42:00,28,Have Tuna or Salmon salad sandwiches for your lunch . You won't notice the fishy smells on your hands
837093,Cosmos,2014-02-19 01:32:00,588,Baking soda is working well.
837097,BillM,2014-02-19 01:56:00,17367,WORX hand cleaner is awesome!
837107,SirCranksalot,2014-02-19 02:24:00,3291,Why is this a problem? (I thought married guys got used to the smell anyway!  )
837111,NANUK,2014-02-19 02:36:00,797,"Another vote for WORX hand cleaner, leaves absolutely no smell on your hands it is biodegradable and Canadian made, comes in powder form so does not freez in cold weather."
837118,sneak_e_pete,2014-02-19 03:34:00,540,Thanks for all the suggestions!  For the smart ass remarks...well...thanks for a laugh.....who knew that to like fishing I also had to like the smell...lol
837120,SHAD,2014-02-19 03:36:00,134,"Sea salt and evoo, pretty sure i heard that works."
837140,zamboniwaterboy,2014-02-19 07:04:00,126,This stuff is awesome!  Fish smell and hockey gloves smell are no match.  http://www.blackrocksoap.com/
837159,Old Ironmaker,2014-02-19 13:00:00,8243,"In all seriousness for a second, lemon juice. Simple. The acid in the juice breaks down the proteins of the fish slime. Most of the hand sanitizers out there mask the scent and the ones that work have an acidic base to them. Some outings I only wish I had fish smelling problems. It's the smell of victory. Unless the minnows have had rigor set in and left in the baitwell to ripen I've never found them to have any odor. Dead bait in the sun, that's a smell you don't want.  I've forgotten where I am sometimes and after I've caught them, cleaned them, cooked them and served them I'm told to go and wash my hands I smell like fish, I guess so. The eatin part's easy peezy."
837354,Garnet,2014-02-20 12:26:00,2056,Table salt and dish soap works great and readily available.  In the boat fish smells make me happy. The more fish smell the happier.
836672,sneak_e_pete,2014-02-16 20:10:00,540,Gotta admit...fish smell on my hands grosses me out...especially when using minnows....to the point I cant eat anything with my hands.  Any tricks to remove the smell?  Thanks in advance.
836675,Andy,2014-02-16 20:17:00,330,"I keep one of those stainless steel things shaped like a bar of soap in my boat. Just rub it all over your damp hands. It makes a difference.  I have one in the kitchen too and it works great on odours like onion.  I wouldn't say it's 100%, but it's worth a try."
836678,misfish,2014-02-16 20:20:00,29133,"There use to be a puck on the market for this. Just rub your hands with it like a bar of soap. The name of it escapes me. Some have even used the kitchen tap at home when done cleaning their catch.  As for me,I just use a towel."
836679,bassjnkie,2014-02-16 20:23:00,1101,I use that stainless steel bar of soap looking thing..LOL It actually works really well..
836681,Fisherpete,2014-02-16 20:25:00,1814,"Stainless steel bar works well, I keep one in the boat. If you are trying to get the smell off your hands once home just scrub the bathroom sink with a cream cleanser like Vim and the fish smell is all but gone"

836698,Canuck2fan,2014-02-16 21:12:00,1444,"Dollarama sells the stainless pucks for taking odors off your hands. If you can't find one there don't pay 10 bucks for a Berkley one at a fishing store, just nick an old stainless spoon from the kitchen had throw it in your tackle will do the exact same thing. Although the missus might squawk about the spoon LOL.  If you stream fishing in better weather just grab a hand full of wild clover and rub your hands with that then rinse in in the creek. Although I would be more worried about the smell from some rivers than a little minnow juice on my hands though."
836708,hotsky,2014-02-16 21:47:00,400,I use hand sanitizer if I have it but it doesn't bother me even when I smoke lol
836717,irishfield,2014-02-16 22:52:00,26272,Ketchup... works for whitefish both on it to eat and to get rid of the Cucumber smell from filleting

836747,msp,2014-02-17 00:26:00,1336,maybe take up golf? Ha ! Try having 2 months worth of roe goo attached to your hands. eventually you just end up giving up on trying to get rid of the smell and just live with it.
836749,Leecher,2014-02-17 00:28:00,7832,I've posted this in the past and found it to be effective just like Freshtrack mentioned  http://ontariofishingcommunity.com/forums/index.php?showtopic=45049&hl=
