I sent a short message to my tennants and they responded saying they had no snow last night and said there was no need for me to go up.  Can anybody...Big Cliff...Beansie...anybody  on here verify if you did get any snow or not last night in the Bobcaygeon area.  Thx for any replies."

837058,Jer,2014-02-18 23:27:00,1426,No more than 2 or 3 inches here in Ennismore...there was more in Peterborough than here.
837060,captpierre,2014-02-18 23:43:00,2521,Thanks Guys.  Was wondering too.  Cottage west of Buckhorn on Pigeon.  Already had 18 inches on the roof there last week.  Concerned about the weight especially with 1-1.5 inch rain coming.  Had 6 inches here in Stouffville this am.  Supposed to freeze up again next week.
837077,Big Cliff,2014-02-19 00:30:00,6899,"2"" here too Steve, I wouldn't be too worried about it. I'll do a drive by tomorrow if you would like just to be sure!"
837079,crappieperchhunter,2014-02-19 00:43:00,2582,Thx all. Just wanted to confirm. Having no cell phone I got Debbe to text them a short message and sometimes those short text messages get screwed up. I can't believe we got that much more snow here.  Too bad.  I was really looking forward to burning half a tank of gas to rush up there after work and then hauling my behind up onto a slippery roof to shovel off the snow  No need for a drive by Cliff. But thx for the offer.
837081,ketchenany,2014-02-19 00:47:00,3229,Hope no one gets hurt!
837082,Big Cliff,2014-02-19 00:48:00,6899,"Heck Steve, I'd arange to have it shoveled off for you if you wanted, I have a friend that does it for $75.00 for the one next door and it is about the same size as yours."
