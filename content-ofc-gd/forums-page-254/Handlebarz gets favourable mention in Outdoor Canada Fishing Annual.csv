836374,farsider,2014-02-14 18:44:00,456,"Handlebarz double 10's got a sweet mention in Outdoor Canada's 2014 Fishing Annual.  In Gord Pyzer's article on the top 25 best new fishing gear for 2014, he mentions the lures for best Muskie In-Line Spinners alongside Pdeez big tens.  Some have known about the quality lures from Handlebarz for some time but, more exposure is a great thing.  Way to go Mike!  Cheers, Mark"

836459,Old Ironmaker,2014-02-15 03:19:00,8243,"A recommendation by Guru Gord is worth many thousands in marketing fees. Way to go Mike. Keep up the good work big guy.  Get on Dragons Den, even those that don't get a deal get market exposure they could never afford. Seriously, have you thought of applying? It's an all Canadian story they might very well be interested in. We would all be behind you."
