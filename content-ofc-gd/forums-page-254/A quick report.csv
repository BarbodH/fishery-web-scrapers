We hit up pres'quile bay as it is close to home and I was unsure how long Liam would last on the ice. This is Liam's first time ice fishing a and while the fishing was tough he had a blast!  I should mention the ice is over two foot thick.... Needless to say we should have moved shallower but the thought of drilling more holes nixed that idea, especially with an 8"" manual auger that could use new blades...  We had a blast anyways and now my son is in love with ice fishing  I think the smile says it all.       G."
