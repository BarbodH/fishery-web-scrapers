837362,woodenboater,2014-02-20 14:08:00,2277,"If the battery can last and it's not too expensive, would be great to have one for blasting around. Fitting into the back of a van would be huge bonus  A guard/flap at the back would be good to prevent chipped teeth lol  "
837368,NAW,2014-02-20 15:10:00,4022,That's an interesting concept.
837369,BillM,2014-02-20 15:12:00,17367,"On smooth snow/ice sure... Add a bunch of frozen slush and pressure cracks, no thanks."
837370,Fish Farmer,2014-02-20 15:38:00,2234,"No license and insurance, that could be a bonus in it self. What kind of battery and how much does it cost? is the next question. Out 2 miles and the battery goes dead? Saw a guy on Long Pt. Bay with a home made rototiller type thing pulling him self out, look funny but worked. Now if I could get my power auger to motor me around"
837375,grimsbylander,2014-02-20 15:48:00,3016,"Wouldn't be my first choice as a recreational vehicle but as a working machine it would be handy. It would drag a moose/deer out nicely, but I guess so does a quad."
837384,Old Ironmaker,2014-02-20 16:21:00,8243,"There are countless uses for this from farming to hunting. Slush and ice, we didn't see that demo. But the video shows a frame for the Artic Cat electric snowmobile.  I think it's a long way from optimal battery life. That's the issue the techs are contending with of course. They are getting better."

Still *IF* it can go 200 kms on a charge, that'd be waaay more than I could ever need. I see it as a workhorse vs fun machine. Would make a great xc track setter"

837493,dave524,2014-02-21 00:43:00,4508,In the late 60's Bolens had something similar but with a 2 stoke gas engine.  edit : found one on youtube  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74wl6Dph9dU
837494,Terry,2014-02-21 00:48:00,14456,hus-ski  had one too   
837497,bigugli,2014-02-21 01:20:00,6138,I remember seeing the Bolens way back when. We also had a similar unit for hauling select cut timber out of rough bush
