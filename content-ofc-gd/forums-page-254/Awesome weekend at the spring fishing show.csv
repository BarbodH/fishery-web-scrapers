It was great to see all our old friends new friends and customers and great to meet new ones I wish we had more time to talk with everyone but the day just flew by.We totally enjoyed the Musky Sunday seminar that muskies Canada hosted. Big Jim Jim Saric Taro were great and entertaining. Marc Thorpe was tops with the passion and knowledge he holds for musky is just amazing it was a great surprise to see him there I hope we can book him again for more muskies Canada shows. I was lucky enough to catch him during the break to chat and pick his brain on a couple fish that we caught last year lucky I had them on the phone to show the pics he gave me his great opinion on what was going on with them fish. Also his talk on Swim bladder and reviving fish was very informative. My wife Danna and I were both shaking our heads at some of what he had to say as we were seeing some of it first hand with our fish caught and were glad to hear what Marc said on the matter  was what we were doing and also have other things to try for the ones that seem to not want to live.We had donated 200 can koozies for the people that showed up and they went over very well I'm glad that people enjoyed getting a keep sake from the show.From 1-3 Danna and I were working the muskies Canada booth was great as it gave us time to talk about musky more LOL that was all she needed. Danna should be recruited for membership drive as she sold three at once.Any way I just want to say we had a blast and thanks to all who made the show awesome.  Here is a pic from the show
