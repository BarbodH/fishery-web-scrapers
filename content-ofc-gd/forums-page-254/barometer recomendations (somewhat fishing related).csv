837315,chris.brock,2014-02-20 01:21:00,4053, Does anybody know of a good barometer they have been happy with? It's hard to tell good from pooh with online shopping and reviews
837324,Gallie,2014-02-20 01:59:00,1215,"I have a $40 one i got from bass pro, cant remember what its called but it makes for a nice decoration hanging in my truck mirror lol. If i was to get another one i would get a digital one."
837346,mike rousseau,2014-02-20 05:38:00,4661,My buddy uses them all the time...  He gets some cheapie ones from BPS... They don't last super long due to moisture and getting banged around... I think he replaces it every year or something... $10-$20 maybe
837348,Sinker,2014-02-20 11:02:00,8692,"Get a liquid filled barometer. They are bang on. Galileo is the brand name on mine. I cant remember where I got it though. Works like a charm, and makes a great decoration and conversation piece.  S."
