837267,10point,2014-02-19 21:48:00,165,I have someone coming with me this year on my trip that is going to renting a boat at the place we are staying at. He is going to be bringing a trolling motor to use. What I'm worried about is the motor fitting on the transom of the rented unit. I'm afraid there might not be enough room to turn either the tiller motor or the trolling motor once both motors are on the boat. Any advice on how I might help him come up with a plan to avoid this?
837268,Roy,2014-02-19 21:53:00,13728,I've never seen that problem on any boat. What kind of boats are they?

837281,bare foot wader,2014-02-19 22:40:00,1354,"call the resort/lodge and ask them? but I don't think there would be an issue, they usually rent out 12' aluminums with plenty of room"
837292,10point,2014-02-19 23:25:00,165,I'm not sure what type of boats they are. I think he has a mixture.
837316,bigugli,2014-02-20 01:23:00,6138,A 40lb transom mount on a 12-14' tinny should not be a problem. We've mounted our own electrics on rentals numerous times.
837395,aero_ball,2014-02-20 17:54:00,19,"I have a 50lb thrust transom mount Minn Kota which I've used on various 12' to 14' aluminum rentals. I lift the trolling motor whenever I use the outboard, and I lift the outboard whenever I use the trolling motor.  I can use the electric with the outboard down but with the extra 1-2 steps I don't need to worry about damamging either motor accidentally. It also reduces the extra drag from the motor that's not in use.  Also want to mention that the transom on some rental boats are not of a ""double wall"" design (approximate thickness of 1.5"" to 2""). These ""single wall"" transoms are too thin to clamp the trolling motor on securely. I always bring along 2""x4"" wood block for situations like this. Hope it helps."
837417,jimmer,2014-02-20 19:32:00,2730,I have also seen guys mount the electrics on the side of the smaller boats. Bring some 1x4 and 2x4 for shimming if required.
