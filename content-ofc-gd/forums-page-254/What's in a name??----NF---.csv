This was also not acceptable so they again changed the sign to read Catatonics and HighColonics - no go. Next they tried Manic Depressives and Anal Retentives - thumbs down again.Then came Minds and Behinds - still no good. Another attempt resulted inLost Souls and Butt Holes - unacceptable again! So they tried Nuts andButts - no way. Freaks and Cheeks - still no good. Loons and Moons - forget it. Almost at their wit's end, the docs finally came up with:Dr. Smith and Dr. Jones - Specializing in Odds and Ends.Everybody loved it."
