837755,solopaddler,2014-02-22 16:13:00,8605,"Great article!  And it brought back a PILE of good memories.  I think it was around 1984 or so that I met a guy who was whaling the steelhead at Thornbury when nobody else was catching a fish.  I eventually asked him what he was using and he showed me these bitty little flies.  Well, they were Michigan wigglers, tied by a guy called Jay Passmore if I recall correctly, and they were dynamite!  Same river, or maybe the Bighead, I took a mid-morning break for breakfast and a coffee and met local steelhead master Rick Simms (I think that is how he spelled his name.)  Rick had caught a bunch of fresh run steelies that morning, when I know most of us had not connected with many fish.  I asked him what he was using.  ""BUGS"" he said.  Like Michigan wigglers, I asked?  Nope, BUGS!  And he showed me a bunch of insects he had gathered up from the river bottom.  He was fishing them singly on a #16 hook IIRC.  I never did catch my own bait critters, but that image came back when I read that portion of the article.  So THANKS MIKE for some great memories!  Doug   Thanks for the feedback Doug, glad you liked!  Jay Passmore is a name I havn't heard in a while, he used to tie flies for me way back in the day.  One in particular, a pale yellow hex nymph was just dynamite on steelhead. We'd place orders of 100 flies at a time with him 'cause we'd burn through them so fast."
837756,akaShag,2014-02-22 16:17:00,2073,"Jay used to tied flies for Hans Fuhrman, who owned a little tackle shop in Thornbury.  I met Jay there one time he was in replenishing the stocks.  He must have tied a gazillion flies..................and I still have a bunch in my old (neglected) steelhead vest.  Doug"
837406,solopaddler,2014-02-20 19:02:00,8605,"So right out of the blue Randy Jennings from Angler and Hunter radio calls me up to interview me about a steelhead feature I wrote for the March issue of OOD.  It was a little unnerving, not sure how I came across....  Methinks I'll be thankful for editing."
837407,ccmtcanada,2014-02-20 19:06:00,7971,Thanks GREAT Mike!  I've heard you talk before....you won't sound too goofy....LOL.  Congrats!

837469,solopaddler,2014-02-20 22:45:00,8605,"Thanks guys, it's really not that big a deal though.  It was just kind of funny, I have no problem talking, anyone who knows me knows that. But it was a lot different being on the radio..."
837470,Rustic-Fisher,2014-02-20 22:53:00,826,"Just got the new OOD magazine, great spread on steelhead. As a guy that's walked, waded and floated tribs for the last 25years I enjoyed the article and look forward to hearing the interview .  I know my buddies( all hardcore steelheaders) have likely read the articles and feel the same yet would be the first to crucify me for posting anything about steelhead online LOL They enjoy the nostalgia of pre-internet. Keep up the great work."

Keep up the great work.  Thanks Ryan, I didn't realize the March issue was out yet. I'm guessing subscribers get it earlier.  There was really nothing of any significance said during the interview, they were just looking to drum up some interest in the piece and get people to buy the mag LOL!"

I had to stumble and correct myself and explain what I really meant by "" I know him"". hahaha.  Hope the interview sounds good; remember that radio adds ten pounds."
