But I was wondering if anyone has been there and can recommend good fishing areas and or guides...  He has his drug test this week then he will be flying out in early march.... Not sure how long yet but I'm guessing 3 or more months...  I know he was hoping to get a halibut trip in... He loves eating them...  And what runs the rivers in the spring... ?  Thanks

The chinook (springs) start in mid/late may, is closed for august and cohos in sept....never targeted the other salmom species, so cant help there.....river has a no powered boat restriction so is drift boat only, many shore spots, the bait shop has a map they put out  Tourism prices are outrageous, popular destination for Americans...pm sent shortly with guide info  Drift boat is about 350-500 per day, salt is 700+, if he wants more salt fishing I'd drive an hour to prince Rupert, more charter options  Is a beautiful area, rugged mountains, full of black bears and goats up high, great area for hiking and hunting"
