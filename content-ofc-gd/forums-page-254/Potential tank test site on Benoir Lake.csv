837349,Sinker,2014-02-20 11:06:00,8692,Hmmm.....interesting. I could probably hear that from our cottage.  S.
837522,Canuck,2014-02-21 03:47:00,491,we can hear the testing at the Meaford tank range at our place across the bay in Lafontaine.  not the end of the world
837569,moxie,2014-02-21 13:06:00,1566,we can hear the testing at the Meaford tank range at our place across the bay in Lafontaine. not the end of the world Absolutely.
837585,ch312,2014-02-21 15:00:00,1590,"I don't think this is good for those who rent out cottages and campsites in the area.  How many ATV trails will no longer be accessible? Will access to small lakes and ponds be cut off? Are there certain times when they can't do testing? How much habitat will be destroyed? If those who rent out sites and cottages do see a significant decrease in income, will they be subsidized by Armtrac?    "
837587,ch312,2014-02-21 15:08:00,1590,"we can hear the testing at the Meaford tank range at our place across the bay in Lafontaine. not the end of the world  Did you have and visit that place before Meaford was established in the 40's? If not, you purchased the property knowing that there was a military testing site nearby and the noise was to be expected. Compare it to a rail line. People who willingly move beside train tracks know full well that they'll be hearing a train and they knew that before purchasing the property. Now, how do you think people would feel if they've lived in a house for 25 years and suddenly there is a plan to build a rail line 50 feet from their house? They'll hate the idea and the train will likely drive them nuts.  I'd say those who lived or had cottages in the Meaford area before the testing started likely have a slightly opinion than yours"
837589,BillM,2014-02-21 15:21:00,17367,Article states the lumber mill makes more noise then the site will.   I think people are getting all worked up over nothing.  I guess that remains to be seen however.
837703,OhioFisherman,2014-02-22 02:11:00,6623,Canada has tanks? We might have to rethink the invasion plans! LOL
837716,Canuck,2014-02-22 04:05:00,491,"Good point.  still not the end of the world.  But a whole bunch of wind turbines, now that is another story entirely."
837717,Old Ironmaker,2014-02-22 04:07:00,8243,"Canada has tanks? We might have to rethink the invasion plans! LOL Tanks of beer my Buckeye friend. Invade away and bring the Budweiser girls and Rolling Rock.  As for the test site, it's the same not in my backyard, if not mine then who's.  P.S. Youngstown State Penguin here."
837725,fishindevil,2014-02-22 07:26:00,6254,Tanks and artillery shoot at CFB petawawa all the time and they fly helicopters right down the Ottawa river been going on for 30yrs !!!! It's cool and you can hear it into Algonquin park !!!! Never bothered anyone before !!!! Even the animals don't mind it !!!! Campers tourists doesn't matter up there ...... No biggie
837736,Old Ironmaker,2014-02-22 12:08:00,8243,"We could always train all our guys and gals in Cold Lake Alberta for all future coalition actions or further north. Then we will be prepared when Finland gives NATO a problem, or Norway."
837745,OhioFisherman,2014-02-22 14:46:00,6623,"As I recall the Abrams tank is made in Lima Ohio, I don't think many Ohio residents know. The old Chrysler tank plant here was next to Cleveland Hopkins airport. It was turned into a warehouse and then the International Exhibition Center, the RV, and Sportsman show used to be held there.  The Budweiser girls might be the only good thing about Bud?"
