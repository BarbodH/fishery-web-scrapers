So we cut up the remaining potatoes into 1x1 inch squares. He then grabs the leftover Nacho Cheese we had in a gallon tub. Ok here they come............we start pegging the dipped potatoes at them as were chasing them in the small bay were we were parked. They head to the houseboat for there own ammo.........we hightail out of there around a nearby island. We dressed up in full rain gear and rubber boots, and used the floatation pillows for shields, we were ready !!!!!!

I was in the shower and one guy decided to throw a pot of cold water on me.  As he went to throw the water, the handle on the pot broke off and crashed to the floor.  He slipped in the mess and reached out to stable himself.  He grabbed the shower curtain and fell to the floor in a pile of water, curtain, and laughter.  I was left standing there wet and naked.  All the while, the front door of the room was open (it was hot with no AC) so the guys loading up their boats got to see the whole thing.  Our other buddy (who was cooking dinner) just calmly walked over and closed the front door and went back to cooking like nothing happened."

It was about a 45 minute boat ride back to the launch and Ricks partner Elroy was pissed off that he had to waste 2 hrs going to get Rick cause the bite was on. Any how off he went the next morning and while we were out fishing we kept an eye out for the two of them on their return. They were in a 15 ft tinny with a 20 on the back.  We notice this boat coming towards us at a good clip but figured it couldn't be them cause they were going to fast, With big Rick at 325 lbs plus all his gear and a 25 Honda they would be really loaded down. His boat was already at camp. Sure as heck it was them and Elroy was driving with both motors on the back running wide open. Twin outboards on a 15 ft tinny. I swear they had to be doing 35 mph.

We were running some rivers to a chain of lakes and i was driving the 2nd boat about 60-80 ft behind the first one. We came around a sharp 90degree corner and the front boat just drifted right up onto the mud bank and completely out of the water. I almost wet myself laughing seeing the prop spinning, the beached boat, and the bewildered looks on everyones faces. The story i got was that the driver had reached for his drink and slipped which caused him to get wedged between the motor and the side of the boat.

I don't have a baitcasting setup for musky so I was using my spinning combo.  I put on a huge suick on and cast it wayyyy out there.  Half way out and the bail closes....yanking the rod right out of my soaking wet hand.  It flew in slow motion towards shore....and landed with a ""plunk"" in the lake and slowly sank.  I watched it sink, mouth wide open....completely perplexed as to what happened.  Then I laughed and said ""uh, Will...I lost my rod and reel.""

Both sides of the run were jammed with people. On the road side there is parking and a fellow pulled into a spot and hopped out of his car. Only problem was he left it in neutral and it rolled over the edge towards the bottom end of the run. There were steelheaders scattering like cockroaches when the lights are turned on!!! The dudes car bounced off a large rock on the way to it's watery resting spot. No steelhead or steelheaders were injured during the melee.

836712,Canuck2fan,2014-02-16 22:25:00,1444,"The funniest thing I have seen while fishing happened when I was about 12. We were up North fishing for a week, and we have taken some frogs for bass bait. Unfortunately, my uncle left one of the frog boxes out of the damp moss we used to keep them healthy when we got finished fishing one day and the next day we fished on a different lake.  So when we got to the boat launch with the frogs 2 mornings later one of the boxes of frogs were a little ripe. My uncle put them in the boat and said we would try to use them up first. No one noticed we had not put one of the boxes with healthy frogs in the boat. So we ""blast"" off down the lake about a 1 mile and a half with the 6hp motor, for the bass beds. And with three guys our gear and a 14ft boat we were travelling slightly slower than the speed of smell from the frogs.  We finally arrived at the bass beds we wanted to fish and we rigging up with our usual setup for frogs. Which was a medium sized red and white bobber with enough line to the hook so the frogs could swim around and attrack the bass. The water was very clear so we had stopped back as about as far as we could cast.  My dad was first to cast and about a millisecond after his line hits the water. We see a wake about 6""s wide tearing towards it. In about 5 seconds his bobber is under about 2 feet of water and streaming TOWARD us. He reels quickly and goes for a hook set by now the bobber is about 20 ft from side of the boat and he misses the fish.  I cast and see my line hit the water a shadow streak toward it, bobber goes under I miss setting the hook and by now my bobber is about 15 ft from the boat.  Laughing at us my uncle casts and says I will show you guys how it is done.... Nope same thing as us.  So for the next 15 minutes we miss fish after fish, because every cast with the smelly frogs the bass would tow them about 15 ft from the weed bed, and we can't set the hook no matter what.  Then my dad goes to my uncle well maybe we should try another box of frogs since the fish are obviously active for the first time that trip. Which just happened be in the middle of the hottest heat wave in decades for that area which has shut down the fish for some reason. My uncles goes ok, and that is when it dawns on us we didn't put another box in the boat. So after a bit of discussion we decide to give it a few more minutes with the ones we have, since we can only fish until about 11:30 and it would take too much time to go to launch get the frogs and get back to far end of the lake....  Half an hour later still no fish have been hooked, but there is action EVERY cast because within seconds after casting toward the weed bed a bass would grab the frog and drag out to deeper water then let it go. My dad and uncle decide we just have to go back and get some other frogs. So we do  We get back to the same spot my uncle baits up with a healthy frog casts out and his bobber just sits there.  I haven't taken the old frog off my rod yet so I cast it out just to see what happens...  It hits the water and BANG a bass grabs it and tows it out to deeper water while I miss another hook set.  For the next hour and half any cast with a fresh frog results in nothing not even one hit. Yet with the stinking ones each time a fish would drag it away from the weed bed but we never did catch a bass. We still joke about it almost every time we talk about fishing."

836772,HTHM,2014-02-17 02:01:00,4082,"The story of when I met Big Cliff and Beans for the first time:  So the much anticipated weekend has arrived......I'm goin' up to the kawarthas to meet and greet some fellow OFC'ers. Big Cliff is first on the list. He sends me detailed directions....I have a GPS. Need I say more? Yes I do. I plug his address into the GPS, it finds it no problem at all. So up the 115\35 I go. I recall that I need to drive to the first light, la de da de da, I drive PAST the exit for 35 to Lindsay 'cause there is no light to be seen as of yet. When I get to the 7a exit I'm thinkin' (a rare thing for me), I didn't think I needed to drive all the way to Peterborough.....This is at 6:30 in the morning, Cliff said that he is up at 5 am every morning so I reluctantly decide to call. I wake up his wife, (an incredibly warm woman BTW), and she gets out of bed and goes to the top of the driveway into the shop and lets Cliff know that I need directions. (All of this time my GPS is telling me that I need to go back, but, NOOOOOOOO I know better because I remember the directions that Cliff gave me. Well to make a long story shorter, I managed to find his home, (nestled right on the shore of Sturgeon lake), and sat down to a coffee, while waiting for Beans, my fishing partner for the day. We laughed about my misadventures on the way up, and put that down to experience. Beans arrives, introductions are made, equipment compared, anticipation of a good day is in the air. The downpour had stopped, the sun was out, life is GOOD! So, off to the launch we go, the launch went smoothly, Beans is in my, (yet to be slimed), boat, with no trouble at all. I park the van and trailer, make my way to the boat, fire her up and help Beans into the dodge van captian's chair that I had mounted on the front bench seat of my 14' narrow beam boat. Now, a word about Beans.....Besides being one of the nicest and most worthy of respect men that I have had the pleasure of meeting, he is also an very experienced fisherman. He's gotta have 30+ years of experience on me. As well, he is a large man, in heart and goodnature as well as girth. OK here is the situation, an older, robust man sitting on a seat that is elevated 8 inches above the gunwales supported by a 10"" circular base fastened to a fiberglass bench seat . The base is 12"" high. Nothing wrong with that picture, right? So here we are on the lake; Beans has pulled in two perch, I am still waiting to get a bite. I ask Beans how he likes the seat, ""It is very comfortable"" he says. I am curious as this is the shakedown cruise with the new seat. I believe him and envy him as it does look very comfy. Beans leans back as he says this, and to my abject, unaldulterated, complete HORROR! he continues to lean back and back and into the drink he goes! I still have a vivid mental image of Beans' head entering the water, he completley upside down, still seated in the chair, legs kicking vainly in the air for some type of purchase, with a look of absolute shock and surprise etched into his face. Now at this moment in time I am thinking that I have killed him, he is going to drown, and it is my fault. So I do what any reasonable man would do, I panic. Thankfully he does not. Beans makes his way to the surface clutches at the side of the boat, and says something to the effect of "" That was interesting"", and I am thinking how the hell am I gonna get him back in??????!!!!! Fortunatly there are two men nearby in a bass boat, I call them over and they CALMLY get us cooled off, well Beans was already cool, he was IN the water after all, and get Beans into a life jacket, haul him into their boat, and transfer him back to mine. They were the true heros of the situation, regretably we did not get their names. (So if you recognize this situation, and lurk the board, THANK YOU!!!!!!) If you are members here, stand and be counted. During all of this Beans is concerned for me, because he can see the huge impact that this has had on me. I am not doing well....Need less to say, that was the end of the outing. Beans I owe you an apology, and thank you very much for your freindship that was offered despite my attempt on your life. Cliff I appreciate the sage advice given after this incident, and will take it to heart. So, do I need to say anything about ALWAYS wearing your PFD????"

I was going to lip like a bass. I yelled I would pay to see that but why don't you use your pliers... So he stops shaking and lets it go using his pliers. The whole drive home he kept saying I really had no idea they had teeth, I just had no idea. Strangely it is the same guy who went on 41 trips with us before he caught his first chrome who got a monster pike for that crick on his first cast for one..."
836780,Hooked,2014-02-17 03:46:00,891,"One time I was checking out how the fishing was at a spot and noticed several carp anglers.  No sooner did I get out of my car that I witnessed a guy's rod got pulled in the water.  He immediately noticed and dove in the water for it.  He managed to get his rod and battled the fish while in the water.  Turned out the be an aggressive 8lb carp.  haha.  But was funny to see.  Another time I was fishing on a pier and noticed a very attractive female walking down the pier with a mini-mini jean skirt, and even skimpier shirt... with another guy with a camera with those huge lenses. Well she was doing all kinds of poses.....not sure if that was just funny or pure awesomeness?   Made fishing that night go by nicely, fish or no fish."
836784,Joey,2014-02-17 03:55:00,9122,"I still smirk when I think about my funny story.  Paul and I were at his parents cottage, on a little bass lake in Haliburton.  The only boat there was a canoe so we paddled out and started bass fishing.  He kept hooking them, but I kept missing the hookset.  He was telling me to really set the hook, so next nibble, I set the hook real hard and the fish came flying out of the water and landed on Paul's back and the hook and the fish stuck to his shirt.  So here's a bass stuck to his back, flipping around, and we're in a canoe  He had to take his shirt off and pass it to me so I could get the hook out and the fish off!!!"
836842,Beans,2014-02-17 16:06:00,3339,"Besides nearly drowning (thanks to Albert) I think it funny how I got used to using the bait runner I was given by a good carp fishing friend of mine...  In the excitement of the moment when I got my first run, I just grabbed my carp rod and and set the hook resulting in a massive bird's nest...Nothing like trying to fight an angry 20 pounder while untangling a backlash...did I learn anything?...nope...same thing happened 3 more times...On my 5th run, the guys I'm with stopped me in time to remind me to turn off the ""free spool"" before lifting the rod off the bank stix...Here is the result (I've caught bigger since but this one was memorable):  "
836844,OhioFisherman,2014-02-17 16:43:00,6623,"It didn't seem funny at the time? But maybe the Muskie I lipped?  A Muskie hitting the prop on my electric trolling motor after I had put reflective tape on it.  Getting chased by a goose in the dark at a local pond, I wandered too close to her nest!  One of my now ex wives using her navel as a fighting belt when she hooked a 20-25 pound catfish, I thought she would push the rod handle into her spine.  One of my uncles, small pike on a stringer hanging over the side of the boat many years ago. Then he hooked a big pike and it broke the line on the stringer. He was going ballistic and we were laughing in another boat.  The look on my buddy's face when the strange fish he was playing turned out to be a fat 3 foot water snake snagged in the side.  A guy at a local pond showing me the rainbow trout he had caught, hmmm.... most of us call them sunfish.  A groundhog playing squirrel, 8-10 feet up a tree.  The plastic seat base on my bow seat breaking, just as I set the hook on a decent bass, over I went and the bass got off. But at least my head didn't dent the gunnel.  A draw partner in a 2 day bass tournament complaining that he didn't get a hit in 2 days. I won the tournament and had offered him the same lures I was using.  Nobody wants to hold the carp or the sheephead for a picture, even though the will never ever see a bass that big!"
836846,ch312,2014-02-17 16:49:00,1590,Hmmmm...people trying desperately to get the smell off their hands after releasing the fish?
836861,mcdougy,2014-02-17 17:46:00,274,^^^gotta agree. But that's just me. Kinda like the deer hunter who doesn't like blood. Is oxy-moron the right word?
836869,Acountdeleted,2014-02-17 18:07:00,2562,"One of the joys in working in the wildlife field is a lot of the funny stories I've been a part of.  We were doing goose counts on the Toronto islands, counting the eggs. I go over to this one nest that a large female is sitting on and try to spook her to count the eggs. She won't move. My co-worker comes over and lifts her off the nest while I count. She keeps trying to nip me so I have the clipboard in front of me to protect myself. The male comes over and starts attacking my co-worker so be puts the paddle out to give him some distance from the male. The male bites on to the paddle and tries to pull it out of my co-workers hands. All I can think is 'imagine a member of the public seeing this. They'd wonder why these environmental workers are fighting with these geese'  Once on a lake it rained the night before and we had a few good inches of water in our boat. I pull the plug and drive off to our first spot which is about 2 hours away. In those 2 hours I forget I pulled the plug. So we get there and start pulling our nets (again, scientific study) and my co-worker asks 'Jer..... Why are we up to our ankles in water?'  We had to bail like crazy to prevent the boat from sinking.  On a third lake, the water was really low so the boat was sitting about 3 feet down from the dock and it had rained the night before. I step down into the boat and slip, I figure I'm going in but we have the motor tilted up and my waders get caught on it keeping me hovering a few inches above the water. Problem is I had no way to get untangled as I couldn't reach where I was caught or pull myself up. I had to call my co-workers who proceeded to laugh for a few minutes before rescuing me.   My best fish story I can think of was 2 years ago. I'm fishing with my grandfather and be hooks into something big. He fights it, it runs back to the bottom, back and fourth for about 5 minutes before it snaps his line. We figure he had a big pike or Muskie. Later that day I'm snorkelling the spot looking for drop offs and cover and I find his lure. I didn't have the heart to tell him he hooked into someone's water pump."
836879,ketchenany,2014-02-17 19:33:00,3229,"Many years ago on tha Geen, we take up a  new bee as can be. Well never held a rod . . . The fishing guru ""the Spinnerman"" gives him the lay of the land 'cast up, drift and reel in . . . Feel a ug set the hook . . . Well, the casting wasn't all there. Finally gets one out and let's it drift way to much feels a tug and sets the hook, overjoyed in he reels, yelling fish On, fish on, one  of the guys down the run starts yelling ""cut the line you have my waders"" and he keeps reeling, we took him home uninjured."
