411083,bigugli,2009-12-12 00:23:00,6138,My kid brother jumped off the roof thinking the snow would cushion the fall. It was messy
411115,I'mHooked,2009-12-12 02:03:00,525," Hey, I resemble that remark!  (Still in my 30's, so not too old by some standards  )   Ouch.  There was so much snow then, that their was really only like a 4 ft drop to the top of the pile below. Lots of fun!...no injuries"
411157,singingdog,2009-12-12 12:11:00,1047,"My deck looks a bit like that, except you can't see the table anymore, and the snow is up to the top of the deck railing.  We went from virtually no snow on Tuesday, to head-high snowbanks yesterday morning. It is definitely going to slow the ice down, with no really cold nights forecast in the next few days."
411168,lew,2009-12-12 13:09:00,12766,"The Mrs. and I are heading up to Yonges Point, north of Peterboro in an hour, sure hope the snow conditions are better there than Haliburton & surrounding areas.  Parka, boots, bags of salt & shovel are already packed though......just in case"
411173,Beans,2009-12-12 13:21:00,3339, You should be OK Lew...  We only got about 8 to 10 inches the past few days...  Minden and Bancroft sure got hit hard...The pics on CHEX TV last night were awesome...  One OPP officer was up to his shoulders trying to dig out the cruiser...
411176,Jer,2009-12-12 13:29:00,1426,"  You won't have any problems, we don't have near that kinda snow around here, and the lakes are just starting to freeze up nicely...with no snow on top."
411177,lew,2009-12-12 13:32:00,12766,"Thanks Beans & Jer, I appreciate the updates."
