411091,ERB,2009-12-12 00:32:00,35,Just wondering if anyone knows whats happening on Lake Scugog as far as the ice? Thanks
411095,gone_fishin,2009-12-12 00:35:00,481,froze over last night!
411099,ERB,2009-12-12 00:54:00,35,"Sweet , so is the whole lake iced over? Will we be able to go out for opener you think? Thanks"
411103,e-z-out,2009-12-12 01:02:00,1052,I would say yes but as always be SAFE out there guys. If you need to fish take a friend just in case something happens
411110,T Fisher,2009-12-12 01:27:00,139,Scugog will be a solid 10 inches of ice if this temp keeps up. I only remember 2 years that we used a boat on Jan 1 in 30 years.
