410240,MJL,2009-12-09 20:15:00,2427,Not sure if they have XL sized Riverwood bunny jigs in stock but you can try calling - Tightlines - Angling Specialties (Scarborough store has Riverwood jigs in stock)  Not overly familiar with the tackle shops in your neighbourhood.

410432,sconceptor,2009-12-10 02:26:00,146,"How deep do you guys run the jigs?  I'm getting into them more often.  I try to keep them down near bottom, but heard of a good minnow immitation jig might only need to run a few feet under water when over deep pools.  Hook them up on bottom once, then hopefully pull it free, and adjust the float a foot or so??????"

410546,Bondar,2009-12-10 15:43:00,817,"Thank you everyone for requesting i make them or have them made by someone else , but if i did that they wouldnt be what this whole post was about i'm not looking to make them sure I could , sure i could have someone else make them  if that is what i wanted to do i would have never made this post  and i thanks you for the pms and responses"
410570,Paulus,2009-12-10 16:18:00,522,"   people are just suggesting, I'm sure, to save you time and money.  But.. I know that tightlines in Pickering has them, as well as Gagnon's in Oshawa. It would surprise me if Angling Specialties didn't have them (and that's a little less of a drive for you). Not sure if there is a way to get a comment from Bill himself (who created those jigs in the first place), as he changed his monicker a long time ago. Hopefully he pm's you.  Personally, I like his balsa floats (I wish he made them a bit bigger for Niagara & other large water, though) a lot more than his jigs. I haven't fished with a riverwood jig in a long, long time and I've not missed them. My own ""supplier"" makes absolutely deadly jigs, that I hugely prefer, and some of them are to my own specs. Again, this is just food for thought.  p.-"
