410830,bigfish1965,2009-12-11 02:14:00,3382," If you can turn off the filters, it only takes two mouse clicks!!"
410895,ccmtcanada,2009-12-11 14:03:00,7971, Filters where?  In the browser?
409736,bigfish1965,2009-12-08 14:47:00,3382,"I am still weeding through all the new features and reading manuals before we go with the switchover. The new software is specifically geared to community type boards...we got lucky there There will be a few minor policy changes that will go along with it. Nothing that will affect anyone..just ways to keep a handle on stuff. We then have to try and get all the mods used to the new moderator control center and other features. There will be much to learn for us so please be patient. There are many changes and we are streamlining the skins, speeding up the board load times, adding features and improving (greatly) the existing ones. We will also then be tied into an anti-spam database which will block known spammers from trying to access the site. Since there will be alot of configuring to do, the site will be offline for up to 48 hours during the switchover. This may be a good time to reaquaint yourself with your wife. If you are not sure if you have a wife, check to see if food and clean clothes magically appear from time to time...that is one of the signs. As soon as we are ready, we will announce the scheduled upgrade notice and then go for it."
409740,Raf,2009-12-08 14:54:00,3495,i predict a baby boom 9 mnths from date of upgrade.
409741,johnnyb,2009-12-08 14:57:00,3413,"Forty...Eight....HOURS?!?!?!?!?!?  Can't wait to see the new layout...thanks for all your hard work, guys"
409744,capt bruce,2009-12-08 15:01:00,820,"That explains where those things come from , I was wondering how they just seamed to magically appear. probably goes  along way to explaining all those bumps on the back of my head  allso lol. keep up the good work guys , easy to forget the work that goes on to keep this great site up and running. A big thanks to all involved"
409762,Greencoachdog,2009-12-08 15:50:00,8163,Will there be an upgrade for the gallery?... or will it be the same ol' same ol' with the itty bitty pics?  Will the live chat change?
409766,dave524,2009-12-08 16:16:00,4508,"Curiously, I just noticed this morning , I have only to hit the back arrow once to go back, ever since I joined here , which isn't that long I have always had to hit it twice to move back one page. Is the recent or perhaps I've just not been paying attention ? I beleive I wasn't the only one that had to double click back, there was some discussion about it.  Nice Christmas details this morning, hope the change over goes smoothly for you Rick, that kinda stuff can be a bear sometimes."
409783,bigfish1965,2009-12-08 17:08:00,3382,The double click back problem is a small flaw in Internet Explorer that sees the Google Ads as a page within a page. I don't think the new skin is coded quite the same so it should be okay. Upgrading to the newest Internet Explorer will also fix the issue (or use another browser...cause IE sux  )
409835,laszlo,2009-12-08 19:20:00,487,who is still clicking back twice? i can't stop!  AHHHHHH!!!
409839,Fishnwire,2009-12-08 19:53:00,983,  That's kind of like how my wife thinks money magically appears in our bank account each week.
409848,I'mHooked,2009-12-08 20:39:00,525, I guess it all depends on time of the day you're usually on. In some cases (maybe most  ) work productivity might improve a little.
410063,pikehunter,2009-12-09 11:04:00,1659,"I'm on the same page as Capt Bruce, never could figure out where the clean duds and the food was coming from. Now I know!  Thanks for the hard work and dedication to the board Rick and to all those doing the figuring out all the details."
410074,danbouck,2009-12-09 11:57:00,4380,48 hours...... noooooooooooooooo!!!!!
410106,anders,2009-12-09 14:02:00,1168,maybe just do it on the weekned...that way my home life wont be affected??  thanks
410114,BillM,2009-12-09 14:30:00,17367, lol!!!!
410234,SlowPoke,2009-12-09 20:01:00,2984,Can you go ahead and make the changes while I'm away Dec 26-27? That'd be great. Thanks in advance.
410360,tjsa,2009-12-09 22:54:00,1578,you ARE going to let us know ahead of time right?????? I will probably need 2 cases of beer to pass the time.
410469,bigfish1965,2009-12-10 04:28:00,3382, Yes I will let you know. Trying to get the software company to commit to a specific date/time..but trying to get a geek on a schedule is like trying to nail jello to a tree.
410482,bigfish1965,2009-12-10 05:04:00,3382,"One thing I do know is that if you are using Internet Explorer 6 or less, the site won't work. IE6 is no longer a supported browser by W3C standards. Good riddance to it!!"
410496,lew,2009-12-10 11:04:00,12766,"Rick, how do we find out which version of IE were using ?? I think I've got 7 but not 100% sure."
410497,Roy,2009-12-10 11:16:00,13728,"Lew, in the help menu, click on ""About Internet Explorer"". It'll tell you the version you are using."
410498,lew,2009-12-10 11:40:00,12766,"Thanks Roy, appreciate that."
410746,ccmtcanada,2009-12-10 23:06:00,7971,What?  My office computer only has explorer 6.0...guess I wont be seeing the board during the day anymore!!!!  Corp IT policy....takes a million signatures and a business case to upgrade anything on those machines...
410749,irishfield,2009-12-10 23:07:00,26272,What's that... i hear productivity just went up at CTC ! lol
410752,ccmtcanada,2009-12-10 23:13:00,7971, Quick...buy some stocks!!!!  Hmmm...but I have a blackberry....and if the new mobile site works well.....LOL.
