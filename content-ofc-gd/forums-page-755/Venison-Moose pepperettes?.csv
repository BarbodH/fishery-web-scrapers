410156,jimmer,2009-12-09 16:30:00,2730,I don't think it's legal to sell Ontario game. You might have to look for someone that farms some kind of deer.
410159,basketclam,2009-12-09 16:34:00,115,"Yeah, it's illegal to sell Ontario wild game meat.  You'll have to go out to harvest an animal yourself and have it made into pepperettes or find someone that sells pepperettes from farmed venison (or elk).  I don't know the GTA at all, but I find that farmer's markets tend to be good places to find such things."
410196,ffej,2009-12-09 17:41:00,14,"There is a butcher shop right around the coner from me, in thornhill.  I have purchased venison pepperettes there before, and they were quite tasty.  They are located at on Disera Drive at the Bathurst / Centre St area.  I could not find a website for them, but I am pretty sure this is a website for their other location.  http://www.butchershoppe.com/products.asp?...=141&pid=42"
410197,ffej,2009-12-09 17:41:00,14,"Correction to the above post.  I am not sure if there is any connection between the two butchers.  The link below is the correct link for the location I am refereing to.  There is no product listing, but there is a phone # if you want to call them.  Again, I have purchased venison peppperttes from them in the past.  http://www.thornhilltowncentre.com/thebutchers/index.html"

410239,anders,2009-12-09 20:12:00,1168,Interesting...i wonder if they are allowed because they are farm-raised?
410275,jimmer,2009-12-09 21:00:00,2730,I believe that you can sell farm raised product.  It might even taste better.
410334,Big Cliff,2009-12-09 22:18:00,6899," You have never had my venison pepperetts have you  If you can find someone that has some extra venison or moose meat, there are a few Mennonite places in Elmira and I'm sure other areas that will make it into pepperetts for you. If I get a deer before the season closes I'll be getting a bunch made and let you have some, you just cover the cost of them. IF I get out and get one that is. Also, can you say venison summer saussage? Try it if you can."
410344,bigugli,2009-12-09 22:31:00,6138,Venison summer sausage....   Droooooooooooooooooooooooooool. Now I'm hungry
410451,cityfisher,2009-12-10 03:24:00,959,love my deer pepperettes!! hopefully I get one more deer to make some more !
410479,ch312,2009-12-10 04:54:00,1590,hehehe...on saturday i went and picked up my 28-30lbs of smoked deer pepperettes from the little buck i shot this season.     get your hunting license and go shoot your own deer. getting a full deer made into pepperettes would likely give ya over 100lbs of smoked meat sticks  anything you buy in stores or restaurants is farm raised meat. well its supposed to be anyways...

410608,Harrison,2009-12-10 17:15:00,2202,"Oh man.. killer to read this around lunch time!!  I am almost out of my Moose sausage already.... my absolute fave from the butcher we use anyways...   Ok, I gotta get some street meat now."
