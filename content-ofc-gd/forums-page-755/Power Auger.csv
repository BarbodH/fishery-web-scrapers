410509,Anderson,2009-12-10 12:34:00,32,"personally i like a 10 in auger for fishing Superior The water is crystal clear and you can see down to the bottom in 15 to 20 ft When your in a dark hut you can actually see them swim up to your bait or lure which makes for some pretty exciting fish tv On the other hand when your fishing some backwoods lake for specks or walleyes a 6 or 8"" hand crank is fine easy to pack and if the ice is more than 24"" you can always get your buddy to help drill tandem style very quick and you won""t have sore arms the next day The wost senerio is going fishing with your buddy that says I""ll bring the auger only to find out on the lake that it has been stored in his shed without the guard on and has been banged around rusty and doesent cut S--t 20 min to cut one 8 "" hole in 18 in"" of ice BAAAAH Same with a power auger I watched this guy with an 8"" power auger 15 min to drill through 2ft of ice he was amazed when I drilled 2 10 in holes for him in under 5 min. Keep ""em sharp stay safe and have fun BTW my buddy with the crappy hand auger I helped him out by putting the chain on his new power saw on backwards    Chuck"
410533,Fishnwire,2009-12-10 15:08:00,983,"My hand auger is fine up until around the end of February.  By then up here we sometimes have close to two feet.  That's not bad if you're just going to drill two holes for yourself, but if you're committed to doing your elderly partner's hole's too, or if you feel like moving around, the power auger would be nice.  I have to admit there have been times when I was not catching fish and knew I should move but just didn't feel like popping four fresh holes with the hand crank, so I stayed put.  I am used to a six inch hole, so I'm pretty sure I'll be happy with an eight inch.  When I hear someone tell me that they lost a fish because they couldn't fit it through an eight inch hole, I'm always a little skeptical.  I've seen some big fish come up through a six inch hole...it takes a bit of finesse, but it you can get a surprisingly big fish through that little hole.  Any fish that just wouldn't fit through an eight inch hole would have to be really freakin' big.  I'd like to think otherwise, but I don't have a realistic chance of jamming an eight inch hole where I'm going.  Wow...I just realized there are lots of joke opportunities with all this talk of holes and how many inches is best."
410539,Guest gbfisher,2009-12-10 15:23:00,0,"Sure you can catch and pull a large fish through a little hole (6"") but its easier to steer them to and bring up through a bigger hole. The more you play the fish at the hole the easier it is to lose it. I use a hand auger (6"") up till the ice is a foot thick and then its power from there on in.  Im very glad when I get to that change over period."
410574,DRIFTER_016,2009-12-10 16:24:00,10439,  My hand auger is fine until the beginning of November. By the end of February we have about 5 feet of ice!!!!
410591,Fishnwire,2009-12-10 16:35:00,983,  I was e-mailed this a while back.  Most of us have seen it I think.      Imagine hand cranking that.
410622,pike slayer,2009-12-10 18:03:00,1177,"i always just use my 6"" hand for most of my ice fishing even when the ice is a good 3feet thick. i wanted to step it up to an 8"" so i bought a used one on ebay for next to nothing, the shipping was actually more then the auger. The auger comes in and its a 10"" hand auger! thats right you heard me! a 10"" hand auger! theres no getting cold for me out on the ice, just go drill a hole or 2. once the ice gets past 2feet then i use the 6"". i called mora about replacement blades, they told me those augers were made in the early 90s for a short period and didnt even know that any of those augers still even existed haha i wonder why!! 8"" is the perfect balance not to big not to small. but since your talking power auger the bigger the better and yes i have stepped in one of those holes before lol"
410627,Raf,2009-12-10 18:19:00,3495,"i like 3 10"" holes with the center knocked out  so that i can figure 8 effectively  i really like it in march when the water running down the sides of the holes enlarges it even more.  bigger the better i say."
410659,Guest gbfisher,2009-12-10 19:07:00,0,I didnt know you could figure 8 for trout....
410661,Raf,2009-12-10 19:08:00,3495,"donychya know they're all caught ""just under the ice""?"
410663,Guest gbfisher,2009-12-10 19:10:00,0,I thought you could only catch them 200 feet off shore....................  I thought everyone knew that...
410664,Terry,2009-12-10 19:14:00,14456,"10"" holes are great  but those guys with their 12"" augers, I mean really you could lose a volkswagon in one of them  12"", what are they thinking"
410667,Guest gbfisher,2009-12-10 19:20:00,0,Now yer talkin.....Where can I get one.
410673,irishfield,2009-12-10 19:39:00,26272,
410681,I'mHooked,2009-12-10 20:12:00,525," How about borrowing an 8"" hand op from your neighbour, get to the cottage at 8pm just in time to cut a hole or 2 for a little evening fun, only to not have made it more than 3-4"" in 20+ minutes!  Ended up walking the shore knocking on cottages looking for a year round neighbour who might have one to borrow. We lucked out at about 10pm and someone lent us their 6"" manual. Let us use it for the weekend. Cut 18"" in a few minutes tops!  Ended up that the neighbour we got the 8"" from had used it for fence post holes in his backyard, and thought the ""blades felt fine  ""  :wallbash:  Quite the learning experience for the 1st time ice fishing!"
410698,Dabluz,2009-12-10 21:04:00,701,"If budget and weight are of little or no concern....go with the 10 inch auger.  I do a lot of ice fishing for cod, halibut, lingcod, etc etc and I've never had any problems getting 40 lb cod through the 8 inch hole that my hand auger makes.  Ok....the 40 lb cod was a tight fit...lol.  Yes, a 10 inch hole does not close up as fast as an 8 inch hole.  Hand augers work ok if you keep the blades sharp and you do not bump the ice with the blades.  I sharpen my blades myself and I'm not happy until the blades can shave the hair off my forearm.  I have 2 sets of blades and carry the extra set in case.  I never lend my hand auger.  By late January, I often have to remove ice from around the hole I'm making with a hatchet because my auger is not long enough.  Removing ice from around the hole allows the handle to turn.  I should get an extension....lol."
410249,Fishnwire,2009-12-09 20:25:00,983,"I can't think of any reason I should buy a 10 inch instead of just an 8 inch power auger.  I suppose ten inch holes freeze over a little slower, but the 10"" augers are more money, heavier, and more effort is required when drilling.  Also, my thermal tip-ups are 10 inches in diameter, they won't work.  Am I missing something?  Does anyone have any input?"
410253,anders,2009-12-09 20:31:00,1168,"We have an 8in and we have never had a problem with pulling fish through them...like you said, lighter, cheaper and easier to use when drilling.  My .02 go with an 8"
410254,Fishing 24/7,2009-12-09 20:31:00,709,with a 10 '' auger you have more chance of landing a fish when they get to the ice.  meanning they wont bump there head on the edges.  but on the other hand if your carefull and take your time while fighting the fish an 8 '' hole if perfect.  we have a 9'' i think.... i used to make 6 '' hole.  losing alot on the 6 '' 9 inch more % of landing them.
410263,Guest gbfisher,2009-12-09 20:47:00,0,"Get a 10"". Nothing like having a window to see whats coming up through the hole. The only issue with a 10"" is that most peoples foot will fit through a 10 inch hole. Just remember where theyare is all....lol You should always keep your eyes open on the ice and be aware of the conditions around you...including the 10"" holes.... Not that I have ever put my foot in a hole just drilled 30 seconds earlier.....  Depends on what yer fishin for. If its crappy and perch you are after, buy a Normark Fin-Bore III 6"" hand auger."
410265,Dara,2009-12-09 20:51:00,3052,"I think 10"" should be outlawed. Too dangerous for the ankles. If you can't get a fish through an 8"" hole, you shouldn't be fishing"
410273,Guest gbfisher,2009-12-09 20:57:00,0,shouldnt be fishing? I guess you walk into open holes a lot................. Maybe you shouldnt be on the ice......
410280,Terry,2009-12-09 21:08:00,14456,"I have to say I have 2 10"" augers   so yeah bigger is better"
410281,fishing,2009-12-09 21:10:00,167,"8"" is great. 10'' kind of too big."
410288,Fishnwire,2009-12-09 21:17:00,983,"Maybe I should have done a poll.  Too late now I guess.  People seem to have a definite opinion either way,  I appreciate the input but the difference in opinion is giving me second thoughts.  I hadn't thought about the issue of a foot going through, that's something to think about.  Does a 10 inch hole freeze over a lot slower than a 8 incher?"
410291,WeedLine,2009-12-09 21:27:00,322,"If you are using electronics and jigging, I would use the 10in bit. It is sometimes hard getting a big pike or laker up an 8in hole when you have thick ice."
410294,trapshooter,2009-12-09 21:29:00,1234,"What do you fish for through the ice?  If you like to chase big pike and lakers, go with a 10"".  A lot easier to steer them up into the hole.  If you have a snowmachine/Quad then don't worry about the extra weight.  The extra time to drill the hole between power 8 and 10"" augers is a non-factor.  I believe you're supposed to flag (with a stick) any 10"" holes in the ice so ppl don't step in them.  They'll freeze over just as fast.... but at the end of a cold day you're 10"" hole will be 8"" lol.  10"" is my weapon!  Also a lot more room for the transducer in a 10"" hole."
410299,fishing,2009-12-09 21:33:00,167,"To me, it takes a long time for a 8'' hole to freeze, deponds on weather."
410300,Guest gbfisher,2009-12-09 21:34:00,0," They freeze the same. They also freeze in from the sides as well.  You have to keep your eyes open when yer out on the ice. An open 10"" hole or old hut hole or a crack in the ice. It changes all the time. Going out and when you came back in off the ice. You should always be aware.. Simple ice safety if you ask me. You can never be too safe."
410314,walleye_man,2009-12-09 21:59:00,135,i definitly have to say 10 inch since i missed a pike last year that couldnt fit through my 8 inch hole still haunts me
410319,irishfield,2009-12-09 22:03:00,26272,9 inches is just right..  I'd just like to shoot those that drill two side by side and knock the center out. Memart just about busted his leg off stepping out of Lloyd's van last Fishing for Tyler event !
410327,DRIFTER_016,2009-12-09 22:12:00,10439,"10"" There are Lakers too big to fit through an 8"" hole up here. There are also places where they won't fit through a 10"" hole. Plus there's not a lot of chance that someone will step in it before it has refrozen."
410395,wallyboss,2009-12-10 00:57:00,1095,"Just ask any 5 year old if they would like to step in an 8"" hole or a 10"" hole.   8"" is plenty"
410412,Sinker,2009-12-10 01:36:00,8692,"8"" is fine, 10"" is better.  S."
410419,The Urban Fisherman,2009-12-10 01:52:00,2050,"I have nothing against people who buy and use 10 inch augers, but in the end I wish they didn't make them over 8 inches... my 3 year old can almost fit through a 10 inch hole!  Last year we were ice fishing and she was following behind me...go figure she fell through somebody's old hole that had iced over and been dusted with snow the night before... She only ended up with a soaked leg up to her waist, but I've never been so scared in my life!  Personally I think 8 inches is plenty, and if I didn't get an 8 inch auger for christmas last year, I'd be using a 4 inch auger for panfishing.  Good luck with your purchase!"
410430,Guest gbfisher,2009-12-10 02:18:00,0,Personally. I wouldnt take a trhee year old out onto the ice with out tieing them off to me first. I'd never forgive myself if I turned around only seconds later and they were gone. A float suit of some kind might help. Never trust the ice. That'd be the first mistake. I can't believe anyone would walk out on any ice and think that they won't go through.
410437,The Urban Fisherman,2009-12-10 02:44:00,2050,"  It's all part of being a newbie to the ice.  My wife and mother-in-law were walking behind my daughter on 8 inches of solid ice.  I was even fishing that spot the day before, and left my holes properly marked, but somebody with a 10 in auger came behind me later in the day and drilled some more of their own.  The reason I was walking ahead was to make sure the path was a-ok, but my steps are much larger than hers so she happened to step in an iced over hole that I had stepped over.  My wife grabbed her, but I did learn a lesson that day.  You can never be to safe..  There's no such thing as a float suit for a kid who weighs 25lbs, so I will do as you suggested and tie her off to myself.  I'm even going to try having her wear her life jacket, but I know that won't go over well when she's all bundelled up.  Cheers, UF"
410449,cityfisher,2009-12-10 03:18:00,959,i just bought my first power auger on the weekend... 10 inch strikemaster for bps... $40 more... i thought why not..
410473,spooner_jr,2009-12-10 04:40:00,193,"When you hook a fish, you never wish you had a smaller hole.  Go with a 10""."
410494,mistyriver1,2009-12-10 07:44:00,600,Another vote for 10 here.  I agree with what GB has said.
