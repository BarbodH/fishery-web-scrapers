410956,mistaredone,2009-12-11 17:54:00,913,Im looking at a Northstar Explorer 435 fish finder.  Anyone used this unit or know anything about this brand.  Seems like a good unit but I have never heard of them.

411269,Garry2Rs,2009-12-12 18:11:00,1425,I would stick with Humminbird or Lowrance/Eagle. That way you know who is going to service it or supply parts.
