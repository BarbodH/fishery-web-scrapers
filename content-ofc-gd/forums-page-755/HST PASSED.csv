What we need are politicians with the will to oppose the party line when it's not in the best interests of the electorate. The partisan pressure is huge and almost always relegates the public good to a secondary place behind what's best for the party. Unfortunately our whole parliamentary system is geared to party politics so we're stuck with it. Even the good politicians get lost in the muck.  JF

Remember ""metrification"". the government promised that things would be simplified, and any change in volumes would be reflected in new pricing. We went from buying a quart, to a litre, which is .14 less, but paid the same. Next lie. Wage and price controls in the 70's. During that recession, and runaway inflation, the government was going to apply the brakes evenly to stop the economy from stalling. The only controls were on wages. Prices kept on rising regardless of the consumers complaints.  Face it folks. Politicians were bought and paid for decades back, and don't care for the general public's best interest. Their interest is the best interest of those that bought them."

Both levels of government need more money and the only way to do that is to raise taxes or cut spending. They decided to raise the taxes. It isn't about saving work for anybody or making it easier for business or being revenue neutral. These are only red herrings. It's about the money like it always is and the guy at the end of the line gets stuck with the bill like he always has.   That's how the HST works.

410851,JPD,2009-12-11 03:53:00,296,"Here's a bit of insight on some of the exempt items... still a bit fuzzy in my eyes..  More Point-Of-Sale Exemptions for Ontario HST    November 12, 2009 11:05 AM  The 2009 Budget proposed a comprehensive package of tax changes to create jobs and attract new investment. Central to this tax package is the proposed Harmonized Sales Tax (HST).  Subject to legislative approval, the HST would come into effect on July 1, 2010. The proposed HST rate for Ontario would be 13 per cent - combining the existing five per cent federal Goods and Services Tax (GST) with an eight per cent provincial component.  ADDITIONAL POINT-OF-SALE REBATES (EXEMPTIONS)  In addition to the point-of-sale rebates of the provincial component of the HST proposed in the 2009 Budget, the government intends to provide further targeted sales tax relief for consumers. Additional point-of-sale rebates from the eight per cent provincial component of the HST are proposed for the following:  * Print newspapers that contain news, editorials, feature stories or other information of interest to the general public, and that are published at regular intervals, typically on a daily, weekly or monthly basis, but not flyers, inserts, magazines, periodicals and shoppers. * Qualifying prepared food and beverages that are ready for immediate consumption and are sold for a total price (for all qualifying items purchased, excluding HST), of not more than $4.00. Qualifying items would include: o food or beverages heated for consumption; o salads; o sandwiches and similar products; o platters of cheese, cold cuts, fruit or vegetables and other arrangements of prepared food; o cakes, muffins, pies, pastries, tarts, cookies, doughnuts, brownies, croissants with sweetened filling or coating, or similar products where they are not prepackaged for sale to consumers and are sold as single servings in quantities of less than six; o ice cream, ice milk, sherbet, frozen yoghurt or frozen pudding, non-dairy substitutes for any of the foregoing, or any product that contains any of the foregoing, when hand-scooped or machine dispensed and sold in single servings; o other food items that are excluded from zero-rated GST/HST treatment as basic groceries solely by virtue of the types of sales made at the establishment where they are sold, such as the sale of a bagel or a plain croissant in a restaurant; o non-carbonated beverages, when dispensed at the place they are sold; or o when sold with a qualifying food item listed above: other beverages except if the cans, bottles or other primary containers in which they are sold contain a quantity exceeding a single serving; cakes, muffins, pies, pastries, tarts, cookies, doughnuts, brownies, croissants with sweetened filling or coating, or similar products where they are pre-packaged for sale to consumers in quantities of less than six items each of which is a single serving; ice cream, ice milk, sherbet, frozen yoghurt or frozen pudding, non-dairy substitutes for any of the foregoing, or any product that contains any of the foregoing, when packaged and sold in single servings; or other snack foods, such as chips, salted nuts, popcorn, candies, fruit bars, granola bars, etc. * Wine, spirits, beer, malt liquor or other alcoholic beverages would not be a qualifying beverage for the purpose of the point-of-sale rebate of the Ontario component of the HST.  DETAILS ON POINT-OF-SALE REBATES (EXEMPTIONS)  The 2009 Budget proposed to provide targeted relief for consumers on the provincial component of the HST on many items important to Ontario families by providing point-of-sale rebates for books, children's clothing, children's footwear, children's car seats and car booster seats, diapers and feminine hygiene products.  The following information provides additional details for consumers and retailers:  * Books, including: o a printed book or an update of a printed book, o an audio book (i.e., all or substantially all of which is a spoken reading of a printed book), o a bound or unbound printed version of a scripture of any religion, o a printed book and a read-only medium (e.g., CD-ROM) whose content is related and integrated with the book's content and when sold together as a single package, o a printed book and a read-only medium and/or a right to access a website when sold together as a single package, and if specifically designed for students enrolled in a qualifying course, such as educational courses of elementary or secondary schools. * Children's clothing designed for babies,, girls and boys up to and including girls' Canada Standard Size 16 and boys' Canada Standard Size 20, or clothing designated for girls and boys in sizes small, medium or large if the clothing does not have a designated Canada Standard Size. Children's clothing eligible for the exemption would not include costumes or clothing like sports protective equipment. These are the rules that exist for current PST exemption, and are similar to other provinces with these exemptions. * Children's footwear designed for babies and girls and boys up to and including girls' size 6 and boys' size 6, including footwear without a numerical size that is designated for girls or boys in size small, medium or large. Children's footwear eligible for the exemption would not include skates, rollerblades, ski-boots, footwear that has cleats, or similar footwear. These are similar to conditions that exist in other provinces that have a similar exemption. * Children's car seats and car booster seats that are restraint systems or booster cushions that conform with Transport Canada's safety requirements for Standards 213, 213.1, 213.2 and 213.5, as described under the federal Motor Vehicle Safety Act. * Diapers, including cloth and disposable diapers designed for babies and children, and diaper inserts and liners, rubber pants and training pants. Incontinence products would be zero-rated under HST, in accordance with current GST rules. * Feminine hygiene products, including sanitary napkins, tampons, sanitary belts or other products marked exclusively for purposes similar to the purposes for which sanitary napkins, tampons and sanitary belts are marketed.  ELIMINATING HIDDEN TAX  Replacing the provincial sales tax would help eliminate the hidden sales tax that many products carry. Currently the PST is charged on various business costs throughout the production of an item. This hidden tax is ultimately added into the cost the consumer pays at the cash register.  Under the proposed HST, most taxes paid on business inputs would be refunded to the business -- savings that can be passed on to consumers in the form of lower prices. Visit www.ontario.ca/taxchange for an illustrative example of hidden taxes."
410852,JPD,2009-12-11 03:56:00,296,"Here's some more regarding removing the hidden PST...  *  * Email * Print * Share  Eliminating Hidden Taxes  Currently, PST (also called RST) is applied at every step in the creation of a product. Those multiple PST charges are embedded in the price you pay at the store – even though you can't see it. And of course, you pay PST on the final purchase price.  Here's an example of how PST is hidden in the cost of a suit jacket. Under the current system, taxes are paid at every step in production and passed on to consumers. Under the proposed HST system, most of those embedded costs are removed and savings can be passed on:  Current RST System: RST is paid on items at each stage of the supply chain; this becomes part of the cost to the next consumer. 8% RST charged on raw materials: supplies, furniture, vehicles + 8% RST charged on manufacturing: office supplies, desks, chairs + 8% RST charged on transportation: trucks, tires, maintenance, cell phones + 8% RST charged on retail operations: forklifts, signs and shelves = Embedded RST + 8% RST + 5% GST. Under the Harmonized Sales Tax, the HST is generally rebated at each stage of the supply chain, so it's not passed on to the consumer."
410854,JPD,2009-12-11 03:59:00,296,BTW.... I am NOT for HST... I know we are all going to get it hard and dry but I am trying to dig up the exact details with little to no success on a comprehensive list... typical of our fearless leaders I guess...

410856,John Bacon,2009-12-11 04:13:00,3277," If the federal government is forcing the provinces to adopt the HST then why are there still provinces that will not have a harmonized tax?  B.C. and Ontario are the only provinces in the process of harmonizing their PSTs with the GST.  Newfoundland, New Brunswick, and Nova Scotia harmonized theirs years ago while the Chretian liberals were still in power.  Quebec uses a similar method to GST but still collects administers their own taxes.  PEI, Manitoba, and Saskatchewan will still have there own non-harmonized PST.  Alberta, Northwest Territories, Nunavut, and Yukon still do have PST.  Don't let McGuinty fool you again.  The federal government may have encouraged him; but this is McGuinty's decision."
410859,camillj,2009-12-11 04:48:00,1988,Truth is ... it will actually be easier (especially for Businesses like mine where there is a services and products mix) ... much less delay in the receivables because EVERYTHING IS TAXED (fewer sleepless nights wondering if the PST Auditors will agree on the PST vs exempt services breakdown .... and as someone who just went through the audit I know the onus is on YOU to prove compliance not the other way around... and yes it will be simpler because the ITC's wash out ... but dont be fooled .. it basically amounts to raising the GST back up from 5% to 13% ... on EVERYTHING ... how they divvy the spoils up amongst themselves and what they do with our money has little to do with where it comes from.  So ... yes as a business owner my life is simpler ... as a business I have to hope the consumer will be able to pay the new HIGHER prices .. and as a consumer I am once again paying MORE TAX.
410865,John Bacon,2009-12-11 05:19:00,3277," Actually this information is not accurate.  Raw materials used in manufacturing are not subject to PST; so there is no savings there.  Also, equipment and supplies used to manufacture goods are exempt from PST.  I.e. a sewing machine used to produce clothing would not be subject to PST; oil to lubricate the machine would not be subject to PST.  A forklift used to unload raw materials would not be subject to PST; a forklift used to load finished product is subject to PST.  Grease to lubricate the raw materials forklift is exempt from PST while the grease used to lubricate the finished goods forklift is not exempt.  One of the benefits of a harmonized tax is the it is much simpler to administer.  There will be savings.  A business will be able to claim an ITC for the provincial portion of the HST on all of the office equipment which is currently subject to PST."
410869,scuro2,2009-12-11 06:26:00,904,"Duder, Nothing wrong with anger or anger at this tax...what bothers me immensely on this board is uniformed opinion that is blatantly biased...aka ""Sun Media"" parrots. If people want to talk issues then they shouldn't regurgitate hack news media propaganda and they should be informed enough to talk about BOTH sides of an issue.  Bottom line here is that the tax is supposed to be revenue neutral. How can that be when we are hosing BOTH the consumer and business? It is the business lobby that has pushed this one through, and Harper is pro-business so it all makes sense. In theory business is to pass along the savings but I will concede that this may very well not happen. Canada is falling in line with other countries around the world with the harmonization. This is good for business and ultimately good for Canadians. If the cost of doing business here is significantly greater then the majority of the G-20 countries, we will collectively have fewer jobs. What good is less tax if there is less business?"

As to our Provincial leaders-they have a lot to make up for if they want the support of many in the next election. However, they slipped through last time didn't they. That being said, I don't trust any of them anymore and I'm sure that's why voter turnout is always low.  I never miss a vote though."

The tough part of all this is the timing of course, and the fact that people generally could care less about creating 6000 new jobs for other people per year across 2 provinces when they, themselves can barely afford to make ends meet at todays taxation rate, let alone next summer when it rises by an additional 8%.

410435,Dara,2009-12-10 02:39:00,3052,"Actually, I think this will help bussineses. Manufacturers anyway  Right now, GST is basically a wash till you get to the last guy. When a manufacturer buys raw material, they pay GST on it, when they sell the finished product, they charge GST at the added value. To submit GST to the feds, they take what they charged in GST and subtract what they paid out. This is what they hand the government. Basically, none of their own money. They also charge PST and hand it over as well. Now when they buy equipment, or put up a building, they pay GST and PST on these purchases. PST exempt does not mean PST exempt on everything. Just get audited once and see how it works out. A side note PST auditors are contracted and paid based on the extra taxes they collect...they always get their time paid for (you think CO's are bad..try a PST auditor) The PST they pay is gone...money out of their pocket, the GST is just accounted for the same as any material purchase. A wash. With the HST everything is a wash. They save an automatic 8% on all buildings, equipment, vehichle purchases, leases, everything they now pay PST on.  So, manufacturing saves big time, we the people foot the bill. Suposedly there will be no HST on housing under $400k. I gotta see how this works, because that would mean no GST either which would be a big savings for a lot of housing.  Somebody please tell me if I am wrong with my assumptions."

The idiots do not understand that our pockets have no extra money. Many people are not employed. Most do not get salary increases. North America and the world are in a financial mess. And we get taxed an extra 8%. I wonder if property taxes will be taxed?  I have voted for the PCs since my transfer to the GTA in 1981. The only exception has been the last election - I did not vote for the PCs and Harper.  But I did vote and it was not for the Liberals. How could I have voted for a leader like Dion? But today’s leader is no better.  The reason I voted was to be able to complain. Remember what people say - ""if you have not voted, then you have no right to complain. On Election Day, the PCs phoned me 3 times to make sure that I vote and to ask me if I needed help in getting to the poll station. I guess they were desperate for every vote.  I will never again vote for the federal PCs. Decrease the 7% GST by 1% and 1% (which I never saw) and now make me pay an extra 8% PST – which I will see and feel and so will other working people. This NEW math does not work for me. So my goal will be to take Harper down next election.  carp-starter  To Harper -"

I'm sure there are many more in my situation; unless you can show me how this helps consumers.

You can blame Dalton all you guys want but you should realize his hand was forced by the feds. They're just allowing the liberals to take the blame from the public (and they're doing a good job of it too).  And I'm not a pro-liberal person either but... if you're going to blame someone for this at least make sure it's the right people.
410685,JohnF,2009-12-10 20:30:00,3494," The way I understand it is going to work is there will be a rebate on new homes under $400k of 6%. IOW the HST will be 7% for housing under $400K. Then the rebate will drop between $400 - $500K and there will be no rebate over $500K. Of course as always the explanations are so obfuscated it's hard to be sure what they really are saying. At the end of the day it looks like we'll pay $28,000 tax on a $400,000 house. Here's where it gets tricky. As I understand it the 8% has been factored into the selling price of the house up till now so if (and that's a big if) the developer/builder is honest about his pricing and leaves the old tax calculation out of the final price then the home buyer will about break even under the proposed system. However, if the builder/developer makes no adjustment to the selling price then the consumer will be paying an extra $16,000. Please don't ask me to go thru the math to get there again.  JF"
410689,jimmer,2009-12-10 20:41:00,2730,"Okay, they're all at fault.  It would be nice if our provincial government would learn how to handle the tax dollars  and not waste them, then maybe they could stand up to the Feds. I think the bottom line is that tax payers are fed up with the waste and the arrogance of all politicians and then they have the nerve come to us for more when the trough is empty.  I really believe that they should have to walk in some of our shoes before they make decisions that impact all walks of life.  We have many individuals, neighbours, friends and family that live close to or below the poverty line and the HST is not going to help, it doesn't matter who's to blame. I don't however, have a problem blaming Dalton.  He is after all the leader of the party. I'll lay money on it that he doesn't look at the price of gas before he pulls into a gas station. Thanks for letting me vent, as I feel that this is going to have a huge impact on me personally, as well as many others that I know."
410702,torco,2009-12-10 21:11:00,656,"This is an interesting thread for a fishing forum! As an accountant I usually come and read the threads as a break from working on things like this HST stuff  .  There is alot of misinformation and lack of information out there on HST which is evident by many of the posts. In theory the idea of a harmonized tax makes sense, it saves administrative costs for businesses, tax credits for businesses, etc. However, theory(strategy) and action(execution) are often quite the opposite.  The current governments (federal & provincial) have failed on the action part on a number of fronts.  Firstly details are sketchy and not easy to come by even if you know where to look or attend courses put out by the accounting firms because their simply we and are not enough details available.  Second, no question the consumer gets this in the teeth especially on necessities like natural gas for heating your home. The exemptions should have continued to apply in my opinion or they could have looked at a reduction in rates which has been done elsewhere.  Third, the way it has been setup will not make the administrative burden easier on businesses because we will still have to track the taxes separately so its more of harmonization on the front end but still split on the back end.  So what are the benefits:  Assuming sales don't decline business's win big with more tax credits to claim on their monthly gst (soon to be HST) returns and that's really it  Apparently we will see other business tax custs and personal income tax cuts and rebate cheques which were included in the bill ( I don't know the details so I can't say how good they are)  Drawbacks:  Well consumer costs on many items go up 8% (including necessities in my opinion) at a time when alot of people can't even get a cost of living increase.  A more complex tax administration system as a result of new rules.  Increased costs at the ministry if they are going to be cutting cheques to all the residents of ontario who pay taxes since physically cutting and mailing cheques aren't cheap.  Well hopefully that was somewhat informative for people and gave some new perspective and insight. I kind of just rambled on, I'm not trying to be political nor do I see have political aspirations for one party or another."
410709,Dara,2009-12-10 21:39:00,3052," Its ok...I'm with you now. I didn't know about the 6% rebate. I am a construction estimator for structural steel and right now I add 8% PST on material and shop labour costs. That is included in my price to supply and install with GST being extra on the whole amount. When this starts I will delete the 8% factor and it will be 13% at the end. The housing guys will do the same because they have to compete and if the 8% doesn't exist anymore, they won't put it in. I was hoping that the under 400 figure would be without the 13% and we would actually be saving 8. I shoulda known better. 6% sounds ok because I figure construction costs  will go up bu about 3 or 4 %  because field labour is about 1/3 of the cost..a bit more for housing I think. I plan on building in the spring and was wondering if i should wait to save money but it looks like not.  And I gotta sell early to save the extra 8 on realtor commish"

410335,JohnF,2009-12-09 22:18:00,3494," Despite all the talk to the contrary the big businesses are excited, among other things that I probably can't begin to understand, about having the 8% pst backed out of their prices so they can keep the high prices and save the 8%. It's more profit margin for them. I argued this with the minister and one of his people a week or so ago but they insist that commerce will be honest. Now I don't for a second believe that today's politicians are that naive so I guess honest is interpreted differently depending on whose eyes it's being filtered thru.  I suspect the provincial pols had little choice in this though. The feds wanted it and they have the big hammer (transfer payments and who knows what else) to hold over the provincial guys' heads. This was a done deal long before it went to a vote. In fact I was told it was a done deal by the minister two weeks ago and no amount of arguing or negotiating was gonna change that. The very best we could hope for were some concessions. The real estate industry in Ontario has gone to bat big time over it to no avail although our guys are still looking for some kind of break for home owners. It's not that the tax hits us directly. It's the massive effect it has on our clients and customers. Buyers and sellers are now going to have a huge added tax burden on commissions, lawyer fees, home inspections, surveys, and title insurance to name a few taxable things. The government may even be in the process of trying to mandate energy audits before a house can be sold. The cost of the audit will of course be taxable, but that'll be a drop in the bucket compared to the effect it's going to have on folks owning older inefficient homes, but that's a whole nuther story. If you're thinking of selling and it sounds like they're gonna get the regs created soon you might want to think about selling sooner than later. If you want to know what it means in terms of dollars look around your house and calculate how much it could cost to bring your windows, doors, furnace etc up to modern standards. That's how much you're probably going to be burned for once it's enacted.  It's another round of bend over and spread 'em folks. Our elected representatives are into foreplay mode again. Sorry if I sound cynical and I say this as one with a lot of respect for our minister of revenue.  I won't even go into some of the industry specific crap we're having to deal with cuz nobody but realtors cares about our problems.  JF"
410343,irishfield,2009-12-09 22:29:00,26272,"The only business that it helps John are those that weren't buying wholesale in the first place with a PST exempt #. The only ones it may help are the small shop that was cheating and going into Walmart to by 2 litre pop at $1.00 and then putting it back on their shelves for $2.39. Now they can claim back the PST portion thru the HST rebate program... that they couldn't claim back before thru the pricks in Oshawa.  Anyone else it's gonna hurt. Labour bills just went up by 8% to the end user. All the labour work I do rebuilding airplanes only has GST on it. Parts have both taxes.. so now everyone is going to pay the extra 8% on everything. I don't see a benefit to the whole HST period.. at any point other than goverment collection end.  They already got rid of Ontario Corporate tax returns ( and now it's just a Federal T2) and now HST gets rid of the PST department in Oshawa as well I guess.

410384,irishfield,2009-12-10 00:02:00,26272," What ""savings"". All the wholesale manufacturers are PST exempt to start with and while we have to charge GST in each step of sale through to the last manufacturer... everone gets it back after the fact... so the only one at the end of it all that has to pay out of pocket for the HST is the end retail buyer. I only see it as an added expense to business... now instead of sending the goverment 5% in advance (before the person I sold it to pays their invoice) I have to send the government 13%. So bank costs for any business running a line of credit just went up to cover the ""prepaying"" of the next wholesalers HST in advance of them actually paying the guy they bought it from. I don't know whom your ""very successful businessmen"" are.. or how they see a gain in all of this, but I sure don't and I dont' consider myself some smuck that just builds airplanes.

410394,irishfield,2009-12-10 00:45:00,26272,"  You're losing me there John... they don't pay the 8% in the first place so why would they be reducing their prices by 8%? They are PST exempt when they buy from the wholesaler. The only one paying the 8% PST right now is the end consumer along with 5% gst.... and the store remits it to the government after you've bought the item.  So now the fact that they will have to pay the wholesaler 13% HST and claim it back on their HST return.. the end user is still paying the same taxes as they leave the store.. the store still has to remit the same 13% they did previously to the government.. just to one place now and not two. There is no savings for the store....other than doing one HST return vs a GST return and a PST return. If anything there is an added expense of having to pay the HST 13% (vs the 5% gst only) to the wholesaler in advance of the sales from the retail store and then wait to get it back on their next periods HST return to the government... so if anything, IMHO, that just adds to the overhead and if nothing else the before tax prices of items just went up.  Then there are all the items that never had PST charged on them in the first place! In the grand scheme of things I think they're just trying to put an end to X province shopping to save PST and trying to get every province on board!"
410398,JohnF,2009-12-10 01:06:00,3494," Absolutely. Our business is taking it in the groin. It's not the direct hit that will hurt us, rather the effect on the consumer, specifically the home seller. They're going to pay an extra 8% at every turn, and that will in turn make our job tougher and almost certainly hit us in the pocketbook at the end of the day. That's why the Ontario Real Estate Association has been lobbying their butts off for a break for consumers. We've been told all along the way that the deal is already cut and it's gonna happen no matter what we say. I got that directly from John Wilkinson a few weeks ago and from one of his people during a discussion we had last week. I don't like the results of the tax but I tend to believe John (Wilkinson) when he says there are benefits for business (and I'm a PC supporter if anything) in the long run, mainly because I've also been told this by some very bright, very successful businessmen whose opinion I totally respect.  I'm nowhere near smart enough to explain how it can benefit business generally but I'm convinced it will given the proponents of the program I do know and respect. I was actually supposed to have another conversation with someone from the ministry this week but he hasn't called yet. Maybe tomorrow. I guess something I said to John made enough sense that he told the other guy to call me. All I want is to get a better deal for home sellers and therefore a better deal for me and my salespeople in the long run.  The whole thing is very complicated and perhaps the benefits will take years to surface for all of us but there's just too much conviction being shown for me to believe this is just another example of the usual partisan chicanery.  http://www2.canada.com/harbourcitystar/new...b7-c2cff0ccf6fe http://www.collingwoodconnection.com/article/147037 http://www.ottawacitizen.com/news/good+pol...5214/story.html  Above are some links to explanations that seem to support that the benefits are there, however obscure. I'm doing my best to keep an open mind, and that ain't easy when I know it's gonna be tough for my salespeople and all of the home sellers in the province.  I'm not normally inclined to give politicians any leeway but John impressed me with his conviction.  JF"

There have always been problems in dealing with the competition for a lot of different reasons and most of them have involved pricing of services. Take comfort from the fact that as your competitors succumb to the temptation to cut tax corners, they're almost certainly also cutting quality corners cuz they think they can get away with that too. You take the high road, tax wise and quality-wise, and hopefully you'll be rewarded.  It's not like you've got a lot of choices anyway. You can either join the lawbreakers and cut corners and taxes, or tough it out on the high road. It's surprising how often the public twigs to the fact that they are better off paying a little more.
