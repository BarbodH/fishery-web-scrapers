410488,Jonny,2009-12-10 05:54:00,1380," No problem. Lots of times something mentioned on this board gets me to look into things for myself and then I figure I might as well share in case someone else is interested.  I caught a few Nipissing 'blue pickerel', a long time ago. Haven't seen one in many, many years.  As for the spelling, I've always considered the ""A"" spelling a spelling mistake, a fairly common one though."

410712,Reelpro,2009-12-10 21:45:00,73,"Here's another Blue Walleye from a Quebec Lake.  The numbers in these lakes are unbeleivable. Largest I have seen was 14Lb - 36"" beast my brother in law caught and released a few yrs back. Usually 1 or 2 a yr are caught over 10lbs.  These walleye are excellent eating fish, filets seem ""denser"" very thin flakes compared to yellow walleye. "
410723,dave524,2009-12-10 22:11:00,4508,"From what I understand from my Dad and others his age that had an opportunity to fish the Lake Erie Blue Pickerel is that they were somewhat like a Sauger in that they were small 1-2 pounds with a 3 pounder being a big one and they lacked the white spot on the tail that the Yellow Pickeral/Walleye has. The Blues were caught in large numbers in similar water to fishing for jumbo perch today, they were also a staple of ice fishing too."
410817,vinnimon,2009-12-11 01:21:00,2593,"I do oppoligize.I should have been more specific when I posted this topic.A pickerel(not a pike),a bluish coloured pickerel(not a pike),no spot on the tail.Eyes were a little different(not gloss eyed or wall eyed)as I recall.But what I do recall is a chain link markings on both sides(not a pike).I have only seen them on the grand in caledonia,about  30 yrs+ ago.Never seen them since.I remember them vividly, and they were small,under a pound.always,as we caught a 2 or so every time,In one particular spot.Please no pike pics, as I do like the pictures,but Im particular to this strain of pickerel.Particularly to this region,and if there still around.,I would love to see a picture,I know there not here in cale.Thanks for everyones input,I loved the pics and pics of picks.And the pike too...."
410826,dave524,2009-12-11 02:04:00,4508,"Seems the Blue Pickerel that my dad recalls was called a Blue Pike on the US side of Lake Erie, this link has a few stories of other oldtimers, both anglers and commercial fishermen. Quite the story, a collapse of a species almost on the order of the magnitude of the collapse of the passenger pigeon, prior to 1955 it would seem they were the most important commercial fish on Erie with a seemingly inexhaustable supply, then a sudden collapse.  http://www.outdoorsniagara.com/bluepikeindex.htm"

409527,Roy,2009-12-08 00:48:00,13728,I don't think that chain pickerel exist in the Grand. I don't know that they ever have. There are fair concentrations of them in the north eastern states and Quebec. I regularly catch them in Lake Memphremagog.

409625,timmeh,2009-12-08 03:35:00,609,"The fish you're describing sounds like a grass pickerel. They are found in the Southern end of Ontario and parts of L Erie. They resemble a small pike the marking on them are different. They're not common but they are around. They prefer warm, weedy areas so the mouth of tribs like the Grand would be a good spot to find them."
409637,John Bacon,2009-12-08 04:01:00,3277," When you say it looked like a pickerel are your referring to walleye, aka yellow pickerel?  I have never heard of a fish that is shaped like a walleye with the markings of a pike.  The other types of pickerel (chain, grass, and redfin) are shaped pike.  Stating that it resembled one of these types of pickerel with the markings of a pike is basically stating that it is no different than a pike.  "
409662,Stern Rules,2009-12-08 06:20:00,342,"I've never heard of any pickerel being in the Grand. You can debate the pickerel/walleye thing forever. They had a good article in Outdoor Canada on the difference of grass, chain, and an other type of pickerel. The chain pickerel is a member of the pike family. When you see a chain pickerel, you'll know why. It looks like a pike except for the markings. What I don't understand is why those pickerel resemble a pike but walleye are referred to sometimes as yellow pickerel. A walleye doesn't resemble pike/chain pickerel at all. So that's confusing. I've heard walleye also called pike/perch. But anyway, here's a pic of a chain pickerel from New Brunswick. "
409700,jediangler,2009-12-08 13:34:00,1923,I've seen both chain and red fin pickeral caught in the Grand between Elora and Bloomingdale but that was many years ago now.
409817,lhousesoccer,2009-12-08 18:18:00,442,"As someone correctly pointed out, ""chain pickerel"" is a member of the pike (Esocid) family.  The other members are northern pike, muskie, and redfin pickerel, which is also known as ""grass pickerel"".  So, chain pickerel and grass pickerel are two different fish, but both are from the pike family.  Chain pickerel have the distinctive chain-link markings down their sides (which is where they get their name), whereas northern pike generally have bean-shaped white dots.  Chain pickerel usually max out in size at around 5-6 pounds.  Redfin (grass) pickerel, max out in size well under a pound.  They only get 10-12 inches in length.  Their colouration is very dark as well, with wavy vertical bars down their sides.  As you can see from the pictures below, the difference is distinct.  Also, someone asked about ""crossbreeds"".  Chain pickerel definitely hybridize naturally with northern pike.  Because both species spawn at apprpoximately the same time and use the same general areas of a lake, milt from one species will sometimes drift through the water and fertilize eggs from the other.  The genetic assessments we've done recently seem to indicate that predominately it is milt from male chain pickerel fertilizing northern pike eggs.  The result is something that would confuse even the best anglers in fish ID, where light vertical bars, interspersed with dots, appear down the sides of the fish.  Here is a series of pics I took showing a northern pike, a pike-pickerel hybrid, and an actual chain pickerel, for comparison ...  Top Fish - Northern Pike Middle Fish - Northern Pike - Chain Pickerel Hybrid Bottom Fish - Chain Pickerel     And here is a picture of a bigger hybrid pike-pickerel that I caught on a rod and reel. ....    And finally, here's a picture of a redfin pickerel, at about the maximum size that they get.  It was caught through the ice by an angler, who sent me the picture, wondering what it was that he caught!  Redfin Pickerel "
409833,jimmer,2009-12-08 19:10:00,2730,"Great pictures to settle the pike debate.  Caught some of those chain pickeral down in Florida, but didn't realize there was a population close by. Now people just have to call walleyes what they are, walleye, and that should solve the confusion of some about the two families."
410149,Jonny,2009-12-09 16:21:00,1380," ""Pickerel"" is a heritage name in Ontario, particularly Northern Ontario. Not that Northern Ontario fishermen don't use the term ""walleye"" but when they say ""pickerel"" everybody knows what they're talking about.  "
410155,jimmer,2009-12-09 16:26:00,2730,"I used to call them pickeral as a kid, but the proper name is still walleye isn't it."

Not sure about Ontario anymore, but there a many lakes in Quebec that have amazing populations of them.  From travelling and fishing in Ont's North it seems a lot of people still prefer to call walleye, pickerel.  In Quebec they have always been Dore.

410284,jediangler,2009-12-09 21:13:00,1923,The true blue doesn't grow as big as the yellow walleye and has a larger eye higher up on the head. Kinda like frog eyes.

The body appearance is identical to the walleye except that it is gray-coloured and has half-moon shaped dark spots on the membrane between the dorsal fins. It also lacks the white spot on the lower lobe of the tail fin.  I used to catch a number of these on Nighthawk lake near Timmins. People who didn't pay close attention thought they were catching small walleye.  BTW,  walleye catch and possession limits INCLUDE saugers."
