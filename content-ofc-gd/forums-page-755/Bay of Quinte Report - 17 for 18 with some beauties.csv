410725,Jeff_C,2009-12-10 22:21:00,50,"Scott from West Lake Willows invited my father and I and a friend (Maverick) to join him on Tuesday for his last day of softwater this year before he put his boat away.  And boy, did we have a great day.  Many personal bests were set!  We launched out of Picton at 7:30am and headed to water that had been holding fish. No other boats around when we setup which was a nice change from November.   It wasn't long after setting up when a rod fired and not long after that when another one fired.  We thought it was going to be a good day and sure enough it was.  We stayed in a fairly tight area and the fish stayed until we left at 1:30pm.  The best part is we got every fish on video.  Although it is pretty shaky filming, we got it all on tape. When the editing is finished, we will post it here as well.  All in all, we had lines in the water for about 5 hours and finished 17 for 18. Including 3 double headers.  The biggest fish was 15 lbs 7 oz with a length of 33.75"" and a girth of 22.5""and the second biggest was 14 lbs 15 oz. We had a few more over 13lbs and most were over 10lbs.  Enjoy the eye candy!  Jeff                                          "
