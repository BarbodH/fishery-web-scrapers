The waders were sitting by the back screen door, ready for an early start sometime around four.  The men were all snuggled in sleeping bags and sofa beds with visions of trophy trout and reds dancing in their heads.  When out on the dock there arose a loud noise, shakin’ the cabin and waking the boys.  Pillows and blankets flew about the room, Eight mad fisherman to the door did zoom.  They slung open the door and looked out to the bay, the moonlight above led the way.  Down to the pier they couldn’t believe their eyes. Santa in a ""Flats Cat"" said ""Hey, what’s up guys!""  In bright red waders and a gleam in his eyes, he started handing out the supplies.  Curados, Calcuttas and a couple of Lews, the fisherman weren’t really sure what to do.  They each took a new reel and put it on a new rod, jumped on the boat and gave Santa a nod.  Out on the water they found a perfect spot and started fishing without a second thought.  Trophy reds and trout they caught on their line, they stopped at their limit and let out a sigh.  What a great trip this had been. They secured all their gear and were ready for breakfast. ""Is there a Denny’s around here?""  Santa smiled and said, ""Gentleman I’ve enjoyed your company but now I must go, got a few ""honey-dos"" lined up for today, ya’ know.""  ""Keep the boat and all the new toys... I’ll see ya’ back at the pier next year and we’ll get ‘em again boys.""  He sprang to a shiny red boat that came out of no- where. Pulled not by reindeer, but. eight redfish and without a care.  He whistled and shouted and called them by name: Now Shimano, now Lews, now Daiwa and Quantum!  On Bekley, on Mustad, on Plano and Stren across the bay we heard him proclaim, Good fishing to all and to all a good day.  As he flew out of sight the fisherman woke and said, ""What a night!""  They gathered themselves and blamed their headaches on the alcohol. Each popped a few Tylenol and never mentioned their fishin’ trip at all.  You see none of them were really sure if anyone would believe they fished all night with that guy in red. They’d probably just tell them the liquor went to their head.  But as they loaded their gear they glanced at the pier, and there sat that new boat with a cooler full of filets and a six-pack of beer.  A little red note proved their case. Inscribed to his buddies, Santa did write, ""Merry Christmas to all to all GET SOME SLEEP TONIGHT."""
