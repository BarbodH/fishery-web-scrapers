One week before the trip the guys wife says there is no way on earth he is allowed to go. He argues with her but she will not budge. The rest of the group is upset but they decide to go anyways.  Friday morning the guys head out and they arrive at the campsite a couple hours later to find their friend there with the camp set up, beer on ice and fish in the frying pan.  They ask him what happened and he told them that he came home from work and his wife was waiting for him in the skimpiest and most see through negligee he had ever seen.  She took me into the bedroom where I discovered handcuffs and blindfolds laying on the bed. My wife told me  she wanted me to cuff her to the bed and blindfold her so I did as I was asked. Then as she was laying there bound and blindfolded she told me I could do what ever he wanted.    So here I am lets go fishing."
