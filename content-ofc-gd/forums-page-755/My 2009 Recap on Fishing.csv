410686,MCTFisher9120,2009-12-10 20:31:00,3761,"2009 has been a fun and changeling year for me. Got to fish a little more than 70days this year by a rough count and I have enjoyed every day. Catching a PB bucket mouth still makes me smile and grin, I was lucky to have that fish. A big accomplishment for myself was finally... and I mean finally getting a baitcaster...then it broke so I bought a more expensive baitcaster, a R-Type and does it ever look and feel solid on a TS2 rod by Rapala!  Took a 11day camping trip and caught lot's of fair to small bass, ranging from 2lb8oz and lower.After some weekend fishing and a few Carp I got onto the bass good when I made the trip to my Grandma's place out past Seeley's Bay ONT.  Scugog   Seymour PB   Basically a few fish here and there at the camp until I went to the ""home"" lake, caught a bunch of fish and some nicer 3lb+ bass for the start of August   Good Smallie for the lake(weird pattern)     Got Dad out fishing!!   Caught a nice Pike   The first largie on a frog   PB bowfin       And a new lake PB for myself     After that fun I had another week or two where I fished a tiny bit, catching smaller fish. Took one last trip up to the Camp and caught the PB largemouth that everybody on this site has seen...Highlight of my life(6lb 13oz)   Then I made the move up to Lindsay and found out that the fishing sucks here lol...on most days anyway. Fished with a friend and caught a bass under a dock on Scugog   Then caped it off with my last largemouth bass of the season, 4lb Scugog River   Now that the year is done with I sold my older spinning rods and banked a bit of cash(a bit)...Bought a ice fishing rod and will be getting some good gear this February(2 more baitcasters=3 good setups)  Thanks for reading and helping me with soo many questions this past year, next goal is to join the Lindsay BASS club and fish some tournaments next season  Until safe Ice fishing, MTBF "
