I honestly feel that this is not the case in Canada.  If that situation you described actually occured they would be hard pressed to sue the police or anyone for that matter.

To me this is blatant harassment and as an upstanding, tax paying resident of durham county you can bet your ass i will be writing my local designate to express my disdain with this situation.   To me the police are here ON MY DIME to serve and protect me.   In that situation i would expect them to either ask me to wait in the establishment i came from or for them to wait there until my ride showed up so that nothing happens to me or others around me.  This is not unreasonable and i challenge you to suggest otherwise.  In the meantime i will be sending an email requesting a full dismissal of those charges and expecting an apology for the lack of common sense in the policing of said offenders.  AA."
