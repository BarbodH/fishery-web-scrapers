411259,Joeytier,2009-12-12 17:23:00,3990,Was just up on the Canadore lookout this morning.  Things are looking good.

411266,Jonny,2009-12-12 17:48:00,1380,Check the shallower lakes at this time of year - the ice will be thicker.  But you probably already know that.

411278,Dara,2009-12-12 18:35:00,3052,"  That was the year I looked at the lawn and thought it needed cutting but said, no way am I cutting the lawn on Christmas eve"
411291,Jonny,2009-12-12 19:19:00,1380,"I know of people who went out boating at the Nipissing South Shore on Christmas Day 2006, just to say they'd done it.  Too bad all winters don't start that way!"
