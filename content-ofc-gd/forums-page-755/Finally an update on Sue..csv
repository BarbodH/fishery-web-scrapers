411145,pikehunter,2009-12-12 10:08:00,1659,Great news! So glad to hear this Cliff and just in time for Christmas too.   All the best wishes for a happy holiday and an early happy healthy new year.
411147,solopaddler,2009-12-12 10:46:00,8605,"Great to hear, you two have yourselves a great Christmas!"
410255,Big Cliff,2009-12-09 20:40:00,6899,"First I want to apologize, I haven't been around very much for a bit now and while many of you have sent emails, called, and sent PMs. I've tried to respond to all but with going to school, working, and Dr.s appointments I'm sure I've missed a few.  The good news is that the Dr.s have changed a few of Sue's medications around, they can't repair the damage to her heart but they have her back to feeling almost her oldself again. She is off the nitro patch and has only had to use the spray occasionally in the last few weeks. She has actually started going back to work for 3 hour shifts once or twice a week because she finds it takes her mind off things.  She'll have to be careful and take things easy but I'd rather have that than the alternitive!  So thanks for all your prayers and well wishes, perhaps now I can get back to being a contributing member of this board again."

Heavenly Father, please bless all my friends in whatever it is that You know they may be needing this day!
