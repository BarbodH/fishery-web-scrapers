409880,Squid,2009-12-08 22:03:00,1656,Anyone know if there is still land access to fish from shore at the pickering nuclear plant?
409884,young_one,2009-12-08 22:09:00,620,"I am pretty sure the area is closed off. You will get kicked out if you try to get in, I hear some people even got a fine!"
409887,Paully,2009-12-08 22:19:00,712,Been closed since 2001...
409898,Jer,2009-12-08 23:05:00,1426,   ...Sept 12th I believe.
409905,Hellfish,2009-12-08 23:09:00,308,"Im sure if you get close they will think some ""terrorist"" activity is going on. Im positive it is closed and cant get close."
409925,Paully,2009-12-08 23:51:00,712,You can get close with a boat.. Others on this board have done so.. and the results were good
409952,Harrison,2009-12-09 00:55:00,2202," I think it was quite a bit before that, not sure of exact date.  If I remember it was right around the time they found the body of that poor guy the robbers of Gagnons Sports killed and dumped by the access to the nuke.  Kenneth Thomas was his name I believe.  Too bad it was an awesome place to fish with no boat.  However Squid, there is water access for boats right now!"
409971,azebra,2009-12-09 01:39:00,168,"robbers, dumped body?  fishing, hunting sporters? huh? please explain.."
409977,Roy,2009-12-09 01:45:00,13728, here's the story... http://ionelectric.tripod.com/_disc11/00000044.htm

410259,LeXXington,2009-12-09 20:44:00,1928,  WOW thanks Roy that was a great read..  I wonder if they are all out on parole now?
410267,Paully,2009-12-09 20:53:00,712,I remember that.. On the west side of the circle parking lot there was police tape on plant properly for a long time.. I never knew the whole story thou.. thanks Roy.
410268,Harrison,2009-12-09 20:54:00,2202, Thanks for for posting that.
410596,Squid,2009-12-10 16:50:00,1656,Thanks folks

410979,gone_fishin,2009-12-11 19:17:00,481," LMAO. i was just gonna say... even with a boat, good luck getting there, cause Frenchman's is frozen over now. there was a little tugger out there today breaking the ice, even he got stuck and had to turn around back to the marina."
411210,lhousesoccer,2009-12-12 14:42:00,442,"QUOTE (Roy @ Dec 8 2009, 08:45 PM) here's the story... http://ionelectric.tripod.com/_disc11/00000044.htm      You see this in the movies, and read about it happening in real life in the papers, and the one thing I've never understood is why people who are obviously about to die, comply with the ""get on your knees so I can easily shoot you"" order.  It seems like they just accept their fate.  Obviously, none of us know what would be going through one's own mind at that point, but I can't help but think that if I was in that situation, I would turn and attempt to fight for me life, whether the *sshole had a gun pointed at me or not.  At least that way, the outcome isn't so certain ..."
