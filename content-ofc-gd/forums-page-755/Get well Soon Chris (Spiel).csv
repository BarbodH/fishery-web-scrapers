409948,Harrison,2009-12-09 00:46:00,2202, You guys wanna go for a beer instead?   But NOT in Bowmanville!
409992,Moosebunk,2009-12-09 02:48:00,3970,Best wishes Chris.
410495,Chuck Best,2009-12-10 10:27:00,308,"Sorry for the late return buddy,I don't get back here near as much as I should.....Here's hoping your neck probs are over,and that's from the local 'NECK' guy....lol....Wish I would have known you were into that surgery,maybe asked for my guy,as you know he did an A1 job on me,even admitted to me that he amazed himself....lol....So here's to hoping you get 100% cured with no pain,and remember,do what they tell you at the physio,and then do it again.....TC....Chuck..."
410503,Ron,2009-12-10 12:10:00,1683,"Hey Spiel,  Does this mean you will have all kinds of time to spin up some rods??? Ha ha ha, just kidding ya buddy. Hope to hear you are recovering well and will give you a ring sometime today bud.  Cheers, Ron..."
410513,Roy,2009-12-10 12:41:00,13728," I asked him first, Ron."
410884,Spiel,2009-12-11 12:39:00,9065,"Thanks again everybody. Each day is a little less pain it seems but I find it easy to over do it with minimal exertion. So I'm relatively inactive and boooooored!  Chuck you know it wasn't till after I was home and the hospital administered IV sedation had worn off that I realized I was staying right where you were. In fact I think it was the same room.    Dr. Kachur was the surgeon who operated on me, do you recall who you had?  Uh no, no rods till the new year guys, I've had a few inqueries but directed them to get back to me in Feb/Mar.  TNT, when you gonna drop round for a beverage?"
406984,Spiel,2009-11-30 15:37:00,9065,"Thanks everyone, truly appreciated.  It's been a long road to get to this point. I won't get into long boring details but this is the result of a workplace injury and for almost four years now I've been handicapped by neck/arm pain. It is also the reason you've seen no fishing posts by me as I've been for the most part unable to hold a fishing rod. The procedure I had was an Anterior Microforaminotomy (this involved some partial removal of the vertabrae at three levels with drill and chisel). The other option was a double fusion at C5-6 and C6-7. That may still be an option down the road if the afore mentioned procedure proves to be less than successful. Won't know till the healing is complete and the swelling goes away but I am currenlty experiencing a loss of feeling in my right hand. Hopefully that is the result of the post surgery swelling and trauma.  Now I really should get back to bed rest.   Drs. orders."

408395,Spiel,2009-12-04 14:05:00,9065,"Thanks again everyone. Each day a little better than the previous. I think it'll be the boredom that does me in though, not the pain.    That sounds a like a good time Phil, we'll see how I'm doing late in the ice season."
408405,FLEX ROD,2009-12-04 14:22:00,394,"Good luck with the recovery, I hope that they got it right the first time and once the healing is complet you will be able to get back to a "" Normal "" life, and hopefully pain free.  FLEX"

C6 and C7 are now one, fused and a metal plate screwed into them both. About 8-10 weeks later I'm as good as new. That was in 2006, never looked back. Love what the amazing doctors at University Hospital were able to do for me. Hooray for modern medical science."
