411057,Guest gbfisher,2009-12-11 23:10:00,0,Don't feel bad. Meegs put up with a river FULL of slush and put a few through it. I'm glad I didnt go. Monday and Tuesday look good though.
411059,Joeytier,2009-12-11 23:13:00,3990,I'll be back on my favourite Lake O tribs next weekend.  Here's to opening they're not too icy.
411130,MJL,2009-12-12 03:33:00,2427,"Hey CC  Good on you for getting out there. Looking at the wind howling from my window this morning, I really didn’t have any major desire to hit up the rivers.  I saw a squirrel get blown off my fence post by the wind and decided today might just not be the day  .  This fall has been a little strange.  There’s a couple tribs I’ve been hitting up on a regular basis and even under ideal, prime conditions they failed to produce any real numbers of fish (at least compared to what I used to regularly experience in the past).  Hopefully the rivers will cough up a few more gems before freeze up"
