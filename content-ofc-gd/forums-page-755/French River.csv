410647,Castmaster,2009-12-10 18:50:00,86,Was wondering if anyone here has a good top map of the park and surrounding area? The one they sell in the stores along the river. I will pay you for a good laminated copy. The park office is closed for the season and I would like to spend the winter staring at it to plan a canoe trip for my daughter and I this June. She asked to take a trip just the two of us before the baby comes. Talk about a good feeling to have my kid ask me that! I am so very lucky to have such a wonderful daughter!!! Anyhow the map... would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!

410658,Castmaster,2009-12-10 19:03:00,86,Thanks for posting that! I was on that site a while back and couldn't remember what or where it was. That will keep me occupied for a while until I can get a hard copy. Thanks again.
