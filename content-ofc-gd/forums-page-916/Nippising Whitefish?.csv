289657,irishfield,2009-01-08 23:39:00,26272,Anywhere from bottom to 12 feet up....   ..still working HD ??
289659,duckdog,2009-01-08 23:45:00,162,"Yes I am and thanks Irishfield, I take it they are all over then? I just dont know the ice here so I am a little leary on where to go I went out a few days ago between a pile of huts on callander but no luck, I would like to go out to the islands in Callander but I am not sure if its ok  Nelson"
289660,irishfield,2009-01-08 23:48:00,26272,I don't know where they are on Nip Nelson.. never fished it. We've had our best luck on Temagami in 48 FOW and on a Highland lake last week in between 30 and 42 FOW. Apparently they like to follow troughs and flats... get out a hydromap and find such structure.
289661,Raf,2009-01-08 23:48:00,3495,"there is current around those islands, be careful"
289712,duckdog,2009-01-09 00:55:00,162,"Thanks Irish I will take a look at my map tonight I may venture up to Temagami in the next little bit but I know that water even less lol, I will only hit up where the traffic is heavy and thanks Raf I will just steer clear of them then, I have a good little spot there when its softwater, wanted to try it out but I will pass"
