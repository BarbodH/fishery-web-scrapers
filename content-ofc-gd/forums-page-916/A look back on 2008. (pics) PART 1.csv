287910,WeedLine,2009-01-05 04:23:00,322,"Hi everyone.  I'm not new to the site but am new to posting pics.  After seeing some of you share your year in review, I thought I would too.  2008 was a great fishing year for me.  I did loose some big pigs, but thought I would share some of my better catches.  Photos below are of myself and also some buddies.  All fish were caught within a four hour drive of Toronto and all were released.  Enjoy the fish porn!   Started off the year with some lakers through the ice and pike downtown.         Next up, spring steelhead to hold me over until pike and walleye season began.       My favourite is always pike opener.  This year was exceptional.  We did a three day trip, everyday boating at least 25 fish.  The fish gods were on our side.  We encountered wind, rain, sun and snow, but the fish didn't care.  A few fish came off spoons and spinners, but most came of jerk baits with long pauses.            Summer brought on some huge bass.  I will only post my biggest caught on a portage trip with my buddy.  This dirty gorilla was 7.4 pounds and was caught on a Gambler flap n' shad, under a fallen tree surrounded by pads.      Lastly here are some pics from fall.       I'll post part 2 soon.  Hope 2009 brings great memories and big fish for all!"
