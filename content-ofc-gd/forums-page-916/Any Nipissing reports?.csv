289144,magicfingers,2009-01-07 20:59:00,37,We fished Nipissing from Jan 1 to Jan 5.We fished out of the calander area with Rob's ice huts. We had a great time but fishing was abit slower then we had hoped.All and all we did well but we didnt see any huge numbers like they saw last year this time. We ended up with 25 walleye biggest being just shy of 8lbs and around 20 pike the biggest being 29 inches. We also caught a 12 perch and bunch of herring or siscos. This was between 4 guys fishing hard. They gold mr. champ with pin heads seamed to be the best. Hope you do well  magic
