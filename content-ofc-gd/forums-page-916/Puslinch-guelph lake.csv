288908,jeff24,2009-01-07 14:20:00,35,Does anyone know if there is ice on Guelph or Puslinch lake?  I cannot seem to raise anyone on the phone. Thanks Jeff
288909,Mike Pike,2009-01-07 14:26:00,1332,"For info on Puslinch, you could call Tall Tales Tackle in Cambridge.  They usually have a up-to-date info on the lake."
288939,Marko,2009-01-07 15:22:00,854,Weird i was just on the website looking for ice info on Guelph lake or Belwood lake. Couldnt find anything so i was going to email conservation people and see if they had any more info.
288970,jeff24,2009-01-07 16:18:00,35,"Just got through to Guelph, their recording says that they are closed for ice fishing for the ""09"" season."
288976,joonmoon,2009-01-07 16:29:00,528,"Puslinch ice is ok should be approx 6-8"" of ice. There were open areas in the fishing grounds not that long ago. If you get in touch with Tall Tales he will steer you in the right direction. http://www.talltales.on.ca/  I haven't been out there since last week and there were open spots from underground springs. Rumors aren't good enuff to go on so call and be safe. Guelph has closed the last few years, the cost of paying salaries and the revenue gained by being open....well not worth it."
288992,PatrickGG,2009-01-07 16:58:00,562,If you need some info on Belwood you can try giving these guys a shout: http://www.grandrivertroutfitters.com/contactus.html

289170,FISHINGNUT,2009-01-07 21:44:00,253,"I talked to a CO on Monday They have lots of ice at the conservation areas 9 to 11"" its the water levels are too high and they are trying to drop the levels before alowing people on.I guess its affecting the shore areas were there is only an inch or so and they are breaking threw"
