I haven;t looked into the details much yert, but was wondering if anyone knows a good charter for the spring fishing. Also is it possible to get out there from the canadian side since I don;t have a passport yet. ANy info appreciated."

Bob knows the little nook and crannies, current and structure breaks and when the river is going to clear or a mud bath from his many years guiding on the river."
289588,Dnthmn,2009-01-08 20:46:00,128,I grew up in Windsor and my Dad would take me fishing for Walleye from shore all the time. Provided things haven't changed a whole bunch since I moved away you should be able to get into them by tossing a white curly tail on a 3/8 oz jig head that has some sort of pink on it. Just before sun up and just before sunset always seemed to be the best times.  Based on the feedback to this post so far I think my Musky Charter on St. Clair has been decided for this summer.  Thanks Guys!
