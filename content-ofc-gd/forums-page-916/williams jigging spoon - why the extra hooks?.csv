289460,cram,2009-01-08 05:57:00,1733,I'm sure its a simple thing that i'm missing but why does the williams jigging spoon have the extra hooks mid spoon?  I can't imagine them hooking anything...is it for holding minnow heads or something?
289461,Sinker,2009-01-08 06:14:00,8692,"They are for when a whitie picks up your spoon off bottom, sideways.  Sinker"
289462,BassAsin,2009-01-08 06:24:00,806,they're there for show i pull them off my williams whitefish as soon as they come out of the box HAHA pain in the   to pull all them out of a lakers mouth!
289465,Terry,2009-01-08 10:29:00,14456,yup whitefish pick them up off bottom side ways
289471,Beats,2009-01-08 12:36:00,543,I bought one Willaim's Whitefish lure a few years back and 1/2 of the middle hook broke off just in transporting the lure around in a case over the last few years.  Seems to be cheaply made compared to the main treble.
289487,trapshooter,2009-01-08 13:26:00,1234,They are for snagging fish and getting caught on the bottom of your ice hole.  lol.  I take em off as well.
289489,Guest gbfisher,2009-01-08 13:34:00,0,"If you are JUSt after Lake trout. Use a different spoon. If you are after Whitefish, fish it on bottom. The side hooks are just for the whitefish as they pick the lure up off bottom. Thats where they feed usually., If you use it incorrectly, it can be used to SNAG fish. Used correctly, it is a killer lure for Whitefish."
289552,jdmls,2009-01-08 17:58:00,575,dual purpose spoon....  ice whitie's river chinny's
289554,cram,2009-01-08 18:17:00,1733,Thanks!! Didn't think of the whitefish angle.  Assume whitey fisherman use the smaller size and laker fisherman use the larger size though....no?  And why remove the hooks?  Why not just buy the williams whitefish in same size (it looks like the same spoon just upside down)
289555,Raf,2009-01-08 18:28:00,3495,cram that works too.. some just reverse the positions of the split ring and hook and voila.  snip snip go the hooks on mine but i dont fish whiteys.
289572,Guest gbfisher,2009-01-08 19:59:00,0,"maybe leave them on Raf. There Be Whitefish in them there waters.... ....I guess it aint gonna happen seeing as how you use rubber and all. Whities eat rubber as well.  ....   I'll make sure I take a picture of the entire 4"" tube down the whities throat.    Cram. Use the larger williams in Half and half hammered....  On Simcoe its the  go to lure. I only use a Meegs or a williams. Thats all ya need."
289573,Fishitrist,2009-01-08 20:08:00,6,"I leave them on for walleye,have caught a few on those side hooks, that was my favorite lure for some time here on the bay of Quinte in the winter"
289795,Sinker,2009-01-09 03:08:00,8692,"I fished quinte today. All our fish came off the williams half 'n half. Both sizes, with side hooks removed. For eyes, I take the side hooks off,and replace the treble with a bigger, red one. For whities, I like those side hooks nice and tight to the lure, and razor sharp. Its gotta be sticky sharp, or you'll miss a lot of hits.  Sinker"
