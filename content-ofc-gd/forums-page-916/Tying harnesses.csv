289252,john vail,2009-01-08 00:12:00,67,I tie my own wally harnesses and currently use 20lb. test does any one else who ties their own prefer a different weight line and why.  thanks for your help.
289274,solopaddler,2009-01-08 00:42:00,8605,"My lake is a very typical shield lake, deep and clear with several deep basins. Because of the water clarity I started using 12lb fluorocarbon for my rigs (P-Line CFX 1st choice) and stretching them out a little longer. My success has skyrocketed since I started doing this. In more typical situations where're I'm facing more boggy tanin stained water I still use 20lb clear Trilene XT."
289276,Roy,2009-01-08 00:44:00,13728,"I tie all of my own and use 30lb mono. I have no real reason. When I started many years ago, I had a bulk spool of 30lb and found that it worked well so I stayed with it. I have a few made up in advance that I keep in ziploc bags (not coiled) so they're straight and work well. If I need another colour blade(s) beads or length of mono, I make make them right in the boat. I find that it's not worth having a lot of them already tied as they only take 2 minutes to make. There's no reason why 20lb wouldn't work...that I could think of...."
289313,bigugli,2009-01-08 01:17:00,6138,"I've been using 15lb wire for my harnesses.  Does not look very thick, but has a lot of resilience with toothy critters. I fish a lot of watter where the pike/walleye catch ratio is 5/1. Too many biteoffs with 20lb mono  for my liking."
289314,Sinker,2009-01-08 01:21:00,8692,I also use 30lb.....trilene big game.  Sinker
289315,kickingfrog,2009-01-08 01:23:00,8333,"I guess I'm in the minority, I tie mine with 8lb XT, sometimes or 8XL. Works for me. I've tried some Floro but I didn't like it."
289318,Andy,2009-01-08 01:28:00,330,"15 lb. Trilene Big Game in green, usually around 4' long. Good abrasion resistance and some stretch. The stretch is especially welcome now that I've switched to 30 lb. braid on my bottom bouncer rod. Andy"
289324,solopaddler,2009-01-08 01:34:00,8605," Really depends on the fluoro as to whether it's an advantage or not in clear water. Some are stiffer and more abrasion resistant than others...  Everything is overkill with me, so it may not actually be a necessity.  . My sudden success could have more to do with the longer 5-6' leads than anything else. (I'll have to experiment more this year).  There's no doubt that especially in the summer pulling spinner rigs is more of a reaction bite. You're covering a lot of water quickly and triggering fish to hit."
289326,sturgman,2009-01-08 01:38:00,249,Never have tied one but very intersted in learning the process. Not to hijack this thread but does anyone have a good tutorial?
289329,Dnthmn,2009-01-08 01:43:00,128,I use 14lb silver thread for mine.  sturgman here you go.  http://www.luremaking.com/catalogue/download_guide.htm  Download the PDF guide. There is a section devoted to harnesses.
289337,sturgman,2009-01-08 01:54:00,249, Found it... Thanks!!

289445,young_one,2009-01-08 05:02:00,620,"15lb fluro PLine anything under is too weak I believe, especially if you are trolling."
289484,blaque,2009-01-08 13:24:00,2419,"Wacked a bunch of walleyes with my first go at self tied spinners a while back. I cheated with some stinger hooks here lol, but i also snelled doubles on a ton of them I believe I used 12 lb flouro on these. (if not then it was 10)  "
289540,superdad,2009-01-08 16:57:00,353,"Here's a site for a harness tutorial.  http://dns.advnet.net/mkg/harness/index.htm  Hope it helps, it's a great hobby, saves you $$, and extreme satisfaction when you catch a fish on YOUR lure.  Sort of like tying flies and getting a fish on it.  Cheers  David  aka  Superdad"
289541,Scott S,2009-01-08 17:08:00,203,I use to tie my own. But I found the pre made rigs a BPS that are awsome. Can make up a dozen in no time at all. They also come with a red second hook that made a big difference in catching fish. Scooter
289543,Bob Devine,2009-01-08 17:13:00,251,"I use 15# Gamma floro and it has held up very well on many of the lakes that I have fished. My main line is 10# so it will work well with the cranks that are list in the Precision Trolling book.  With your drag set correctly and a good rod, you should be able to get many walleyes in the boat. I did see some heavy line and ""wire"" used last yr while I was fishing the MWC in Dunkirk NY. The fish were deep 80-110 down and it did not seem to spook the walleyes. "
289550,LeXXington,2009-01-08 17:50:00,1928,"I use 20lb flouro, I tried mono but it just kept getting tangled. More for the way I was storing.  Tying your own is lots of fun"
