288007,wallacio,2009-01-05 15:28:00,475,"1) Turn the chart speed to max (""Ultra"") - this will ensure that data is virtually instantaneous ie no lag. 2) Adjust sensitivity up so that you are able to mark fish and your lure(s) but not so high that you are getting too much ""noise"" etc. 3) I like the split view screen where the main screen is the bottom zoom and the side screen is the whole water column as most ice fishing hits are close to bottom.  Hope that helps - good luck!"
