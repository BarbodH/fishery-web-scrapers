288014,ehg,2009-01-05 16:01:00,2666,"Again thanks for further replies!   I did try one of those baits but need to go a little deeper, so i'll bring splitshots next time and thanks again.  Not a big fan of ice fishing as well that's why i try this boat stuff. Quinte walleye through ice ain't bad however.  Light north winds and staying warm(boot warmers) are some of the key things. I'll send a PM when i have more time."
288016,LeXXington,2009-01-05 16:23:00,1928,I am going to get hot coffee after reading that...  good going

288785,blakewalk,2009-01-07 02:37:00,86,"Woah! Thats alot of work, you deserve such a great catch for the day!  That makes me want to get out on the open water"
289851,snag,2009-01-09 04:50:00,1932,"You are hardcore!  If half the people here only knew!!!!!!  You're like the terminator!    The band called the ""Ozark Mountain Daredevils"" had an album named: Nuclear Fishin'  it was dedicated to you!!!  "
287561,ehg,2009-01-04 04:33:00,2666,"One of my favorite type of fishing is trolling around the big lake in mid winter. Was surprised today to see a few others chose to do the same thing as well.  Got to destination around 3 pm and saw some ice fisherman a little yonder,  made me think that Quinte probably had some decent ice somewhere for some walleyes.    Ended up throwing the boat in the big lake and trolled the softwater. Caught some brown trout and white bass which were the species targeted and desired. Here is the first and one of the smaller brown trout, buddy Dave caught.   Here is one of the average size white bass   It sure was a cold out there with -6 C/21 F temperatures but the trolling/casting took the chill away at times.  Ended up catching one of my better brown trouts out there which made my winter so far.   That fish probably fought and did runs for nearly 15 minutes, by the time it was landed my hands were frozen  Thought i would post largest white bass of the day   Just thought i'd share these photos and experience.  Cheers, ehg"

287662,mikeh,2009-01-04 16:54:00,824,"great report as always. I'm sure you get a nice little workout taking the boat off the van and carrying it across the beach to the water, would love to see a couple of pictures where you launch next time."
287694,MarcusDiGiovanni,2009-01-04 18:27:00,182,"May as well join the club...  that auda do it, nice job bro!"
287705,ehg,2009-01-04 18:53:00,2666,"Thanks for the replies, glad you enjoyed the few pictures! There was a few other boats out there as well, so some other folks are hardcore for fishing as well.    Actually we both are born of French-Canadian descent;  close enough though.  Ya it's colder than ice fishing due to exposure and the lack ability to move around and warm up. Only spent 2 hours or so on the water.   :canadian:  Thanks mikeh, thought about posting pics of launching years ago when shoreline ice forced us to lower the boat down a cliff(behind me in the pic of large brown). I'll never go down the cliff again, that was too brutal and now i'm old. I think..."
287717,tjsa,2009-01-04 19:41:00,1578,"Great report, great fish also. Thanks for posting this.  But.............I think you guys and the others that were out there are a half bubble off of plumb   :lol:  -6C, yeaaacchh. One walleye opener a few years back, it was +1C with rain, and I got so badly cramped up I almost could not help my bud get all the gear loaded back up on the truck.  Once in the truck, my lower back started to have spasms. Told him to just keep driving through my moaning. He turned up the stereo louder to drown me out,   :w00t:"
