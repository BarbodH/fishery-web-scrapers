288924,Curtis,2009-01-07 15:04:00,83,I had an underwater camera given to me for christams. It is a Fish Tv plus unit with red led lights and a lead and plastic fish looking body without the fish pattern painted on it. I am begining to think that maybe it is spooking the fish. The ice is now covered in snow so i have to use the lights on it no matter what time i go fishing throughout the day. Could the lights maybe be spooking the fish?
288925,Fisherman,2009-01-07 15:07:00,7201,"I've never encountered any spooking, even wiggling the camera, lights on/off and panning the camera."
288926,johnnyb,2009-01-07 15:07:00,3413,"We were using ours on the weekend, and as long as the lights weren't on, the fish had no problem.  So far though, with the lights on, the fish never came around....time will tell, but for now, I'll hope that it was just coincidence."
288927,jonnybass,2009-01-07 15:07:00,346,"I'm not 100% certain about this particular case, but in many instances, fish are attracted to artificial light.  That's why it is illegal to use certain lights while night fishing from what I understand."
288961,DANIMAL,2009-01-07 15:48:00,215,It depends on the mood and species of fish. Sometimes it makes them a little bit hesitant to bite. But sometimes it attracts fish and makes them more agressive. My brother had a pike attack his camera one time.
288964,Dozer,2009-01-07 15:51:00,896,"Fish are curious.  Some may spook at first but they'll get to a safe distance and turn right around to see what is going on.  I've had bass slam my friends pink hair ""thingy ma jig"" right from my hands... swam behind a gar pike for a good 5 minutes...  couldn't be bothered.  I've seen video's on the net when fish slammed the camera it self!  lol"
288966,fishermccann,2009-01-07 16:07:00,655,"I also have an Aqua-view and I have had fish come right up to the camera ,with the lights on an give us the FIN."
289105,LeXXington,2009-01-07 20:08:00,1928,I have only seen perch on the view and never an issue..
289107,xeon,2009-01-07 20:12:00,350,"Whitefish didnt really do anything when I was using a unit last year, but they could be use to it."
289126,TJQ,2009-01-07 20:46:00,7806,Answer ... no...
289137,BassAsin,2009-01-07 20:54:00,806,when we were using the fish tv last year lookin for a sunken trunk we had a large pike chow down on the camera for a few seconds before realizing it was made of lead!!! had no lines at work with me!
289190,Rich,2009-01-07 22:17:00,3927,"The lights do spook certain species.  Crappies however, seem to be attracted to the light if left stationary long enough."
