289443,rbaquial,2009-01-08 04:46:00,968,Where is this place exactly? Can anyone show a link/map of it?
289452,smbhunter,2009-01-08 05:18:00,186,"I could write about the whole story of Daniel's Ark, worked there for 2 years, but I don't think it's my place to say anything. It is shut down though, which is very unfortunate, but on the bright side it was the best 2 years of my life. I learned so much from being there and had a great time while doing it. Met some incredible people there as well, even a couple guys that I work with now. It's a shame the place isn't open any more."
289488,sully,2009-01-08 13:29:00,40,"I brought the family there maybe 10 years ago for some icefishing. Fishing was so-so, but we did have an amazing experience. At the time the washrooms were inside the house/main building. I brought my kids in to use the can and were greeted by 3 big playful kittens. kids loved playing with 'em, turns out they were baby cougars...absolutely awesome experience."
289492,Guest gbfisher,2009-01-08 13:47:00,0," Can't tell from your picture but....were you the kid who was bitten on the back by the baby cougar? Nasty little critter...... Good old Dan had lots of ideas, it's to bad about the rest. Wonder what ever happened to Zambooka. She was an amazing PET..... Sad story all around."
289539,muskeybugged,2009-01-08 16:39:00,282,I think Bob Izumi did a show there.  Up the road from me all those years and I never took advantage of it.  Too bad it's gone.
