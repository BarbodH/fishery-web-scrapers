I have a couple of those spoons and haven't caught anything with them, so after reading that, ive obviously been doing something wrong."
289486,Guest gbfisher,2009-01-08 13:25:00,0,"The Lakers like them when they flutter down. The whitefish like them usually on the bottom laying flat with a tight line so you can feel them pick it up. Only a small twitch is needed to entice them. You can attract them from far with a jigging motion of up to two feet off bottom. Always let it hit bottom and REST it flat. A few wrist twitches and if they see it they will come in a pick it up. ...At least, that's what you'd like to happen.  There has to be fish in the Area as well.  Good luck"

Hawg Hunter"
289495,T Fisher,2009-01-08 14:06:00,139,"Drop the Williams to the bottom, sand or rock make the lure stand on the treble hook and then lay it down, repeat that 3 times then hold for three seconds and do it all over again.  Works even better when you add sent to the spoon."
289506,Sinker,2009-01-08 14:48:00,8692,"The williams is designed to imitate a minnow, feeding off bottom. Just picture a minnow, feeding on bottom,and make the spoon do it.  I just jig it with short jigs (~6""), but pretty quick usually, with a pause here and there. As soon as my line goes tight, I'm lifting it again. Jig it in your hole, and see what looks the most like a feeding minnow to you.....  I'm only talking whities here.....for eyes/lakers I usually giever a good lift.  Sinker"
289510,Fang,2009-01-08 15:01:00,1330,"Usually never change this routine with a williams or other sppons unless I start seeing high fish on the finder  drop down to 5ft off the bottom  6"" lift, repeat 1-2 minutes 1 12-24"" pull and lower down slowly so you keep contact with the spoon sit still for a 10-15 seconds  and repeat, watch the graph and any time the bottom line thickens up drop the spoon right down on the bottom and then real up 10-15ft. Jig there a few times and then return to 5ft above bottom  I've get most hits on that longer pull and even when the spoon is at rest. At rest I beleive the spoon is spinning to releave the line twist.  I also fish a type of blade bait on Simcoe called a Blue Fox Wiggle stick. Like a rapala, when you jig this it goes around in a circle. Lots of guys out on long shoal will jig these for 5-10 minutes and then let them hang above the bottom and the line will get unspun. Saw a lot of fish hit these lures when they were just left to spin."
289511,Fang,2009-01-08 15:01:00,1330,also works well for both trout and whitefish
