289016,Billy Bob,2009-01-07 17:34:00,5865," I realize you pay high taxes in Canada but we also do in NYS.  Our new Governor wants to ADD another 135 NEW fees and taxes this year alone. Our property taxes are the HIGHEST in the nation and so is our sales tax. It cost me $300 per MONTH for my taxes on a home I outright own.  Just one example of Paterson's new nit wit taxes........... tax on non-diet soft drinks. This guy hasn't seen a tax he doesn't like........Oh BTW, he wants to make it easier to get on welfare, like no more personal interviews or finger prints. Ya, great idea, didn't they learn from years ago that there were MANY caught living in NC and having their NYS welfare checks forward to them by relatives.  Now you got me started...........  SORRY about the rant....  Go catch a fish and be happy."
289019,jonnybass,2009-01-07 17:40:00,346," OK, so you effectively will be getting an aspartame tax break?"
289047,irishfield,2009-01-07 18:17:00,26272,I hear ya Billy Bob... I guess you'd really hate the $1100 a month I'm forking out for property tax here in Penetang....on a gravel road!   That reminds me.. I've got some appeals to write to MPAC...  The cheapest gas I saw in my travels on the weekend... Smiths Falls was only 60.7 cents a litre !!
289049,limeyangler,2009-01-07 18:24:00,5204,   Was..........now 82cents this morning.......price rise of 20 cents in less than 24hours....some crap goin on here me thinks.
289197,holdfast,2009-01-07 22:31:00,1813," I got to admit that I do whine about gas prices.  Because I know that we are getting Robbed.  I know that the Speculaters and the Gas Companies are in Bed togeather.  What I also know is that the Governments in Canada if they (want) can do someting about it.  Its our (Canadas) Resource don't forget.  Maybe why you can tell me why the big jump.  Remember also, Albertas and Saskatchewans economy will prosper if gas goes up.  But the reality is that I travel a distance to work and pleasure and there is nothing that kills my pocketbook than the price of gas.  Oh yea, then there is the fallout for food prices.  Thanks for the tips though.  Im not argueing just discussing why the Big hike.  Now crude took a big hit."
289262,Guest lundboy,2009-01-08 00:27:00,0," Sorry,  What you THINK is that they are Canada's resources.  Actual fact is that many decades ago they were signed over via U.N. treatise.  Same with some of our heritage parks and monuments to UNESCO under a program called UNESCO World Heritage http://whc.unesco.org/en/list.  What this list doesn't show are many pieces of land that are listed as targets for sustainable development which encompasses a good deal of any area inhabited with wildlife.  It is a perpetuated myth that resources are owned by the country that they reside in, same that the ""tax payer"" thinks they own their home when they have paid it off.  We own our own oil fields no more than Iraq, Iran, Saudi, or the U.S. owns theirs."

289350,danbo,2009-01-08 02:07:00,2646,"Actually though..we're all in this mess together. Therefore a Big Change is obviously needed to ensure our future. Improvise, adapt & overcome is the key. USA Goverment & all world powers know we have plenty of alternative power/fuel sources..the trick is to get off of Fossil fuels. Solar,wind,hydrogen,electro-magnetic,batteries,tidal power etcetera. It's is all waiting to be used & implemented. I look forward to positive alternatives that ensure my great-great Grand children have a nicer Planet than I had. Don't just Pray for help..get involved. Car-pooling,public transit,Sharing & caring is all it takes.......  Peace."
289426,John Bacon,2009-01-08 04:10:00,3277," Actually pumps do compensate for temperature fluxuations.  The pumps actually state that right on them that they are volume corrected to 15 degrees celcius.  Also, I don't believe that the underground temperature fluxuates significantly through-out the day.  Air temperature and the surface temperature will warm up through the day.  However, the temperature 20 feet down isn't going to change much."
