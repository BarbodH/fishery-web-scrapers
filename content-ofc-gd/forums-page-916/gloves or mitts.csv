289075,babaganoush,2009-01-07 19:25:00,105,"what do all of you wear when ice fishing. thinking about buying a nice pair of mitts for fishing, i have always worn gloves but for some reason my hands are getting cold this year"
289081,BassAsin,2009-01-07 19:28:00,806,"leather mitts with a sheeps wool liner all the way, 100% better than gloves!!!!!"
289098,Sinker,2009-01-07 19:57:00,8692,"Yep, mitts all the way. Make sure they're easy to get off. I like it when I can just flick them off without any issues.  Sinker"
289099,LeXXington,2009-01-07 19:59:00,1928,I carry both.  Mitts keep you warmer but gloves allow you more controll
289100,xeon,2009-01-07 19:59:00,350,mitts
289133,limeyangler,2009-01-07 20:52:00,5204,   DITTO
289136,fishermccann,2009-01-07 20:54:00,655,"Re-Ditto, as well, again."
289142,BassAsin,2009-01-07 20:59:00,806,but we are all in agreeance that mitts are warmer correct?
289159,xeon,2009-01-07 21:24:00,350," For the most part. Get yourself some real warm snowmobile gloves, then some of those hand warmers, and your set.  Actually, look at the Ice Armour gloves, im sure their warm."
289162,kemper,2009-01-07 21:27:00,2232,"mitts are far warmer, but sometimes the situation calls for gloves.  I actually have a pair of mitts that I have learned to pinn with, as long as I dont get any tangles were good to go!"
289164,misfish,2009-01-07 21:30:00,29133,"MITTS.  The reason,you can make a fist in them and warm up yer hands alot easier then if you had gloves,also you keep all the heat in one area."
289193,bushart,2009-01-07 22:27:00,2628,"Bare Hands!!  Cause I'm, the toughest Fine Artist on the frozen pond----Heck even reach down 2 feet of ice and lip a northern and land him thatta way----You gotta be tough from the great white north....  OK Gloves  Bushart"
289198,babaganoush,2009-01-07 22:33:00,105,just went out and bought a nice pair of mitts picked up one of my ice fishing rods and find it a little hard to jig with mitts on im going back to gloves
289292,bbog,2009-01-08 01:00:00,665,"Yep, I use the same - just wish I had them on when selecting my ice fishing combo. While very warm they can be a bit bulky."
289309,Sinker,2009-01-08 01:13:00,8692," That's why you need mitts that you can just shake off quick. Set the hook, and shake your reel mitt off.  To be honest, 99% of the time, I'm wearing hand knit wool mitts. Ask anyone who's fished with me. If my hands aren't bare, I've got my newfie mitts on. The ones with the trigger finger!  They have to be pure wool, right off the sheeps back!!  Sinker"
