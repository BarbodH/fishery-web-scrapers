289353,ciceri,2009-01-08 02:16:00,535,"so me and a friend went to Scugog tonight, had some success  tried out the new portable    first fish    Caught another smaller one, but got off at the lip of the hole and i let it swim down.  Few Perch suckin on our minnows. Along with another walleye, never got the hook into it though.  And then the beast comes out to play. I had this one on twice in the same minute, didnt get the hookset in cause my drag was to loose, but then it goes over to my friends minnow and he had it set just right    I had to get a picture with this monster too  Oh, it was 6 LBS.  Couple guys around use getting some panfish, and a couple musky.  "
