288929,Roy,2009-01-07 15:08:00,13728,The best guy I know is Sam at Carra Outdoors in Belleville. You will never be disappointed.  http://www.carraoutdoors.com/
288960,Gerritt,2009-01-07 15:48:00,6129,I would firmly second Roy's recommendation.  Sam is a great guy!  G
288963,chilli,2009-01-07 15:51:00,199,http://www.lanzshootingsupplies.com/ Lanz is right on the silverdale gun range so you can site it in right there. St Annes/Smithville.  Also Erie Tracker in Port C. They're popular because they have good service.  I thought one of the biggest gun movers was a store in your area Kitchener I believe.  Hey don't buy cheap. get something recommended. I bought the mossberg 500 combo and I'm not very happy with the shot pattern or noise of the pump mechanism. Should have listened and spent another $150 bucks.
288969,Fang,2009-01-07 16:18:00,1330,"locally for Guelph I would recommend Shooters Choice Kitchener and Fishing World Hamilton. SC has a website which they do list the used firearms.  Last time I was out at Gagnon in Oshawa, they had a good selection of used shotguns."
288978,Sinker,2009-01-07 16:30:00,8692,I get most of my firearms/ammo from gagnons. They have an online gun shop on thier website.  You can't go wrong with a Remington 870 combo for a shotgun set up. I wouldn't trade mine for any other shotty!! She justs keeps on going!  Sinker
288985,danbo,2009-01-07 16:44:00,2646,You'll save a bundle $$$ buying used. Get a Semi-auto Winchester for a duck gun. Get an English stock for a Grouse gun. Get a Bow for deer.
288990,danbo,2009-01-07 16:50:00,2646,Google: Ontario hunting forums. Then search their classifieds.  http://www.ontariotrophybucks.com/

289157,xeon,2009-01-07 21:21:00,350,"How I gun shop:  If im impressed with the stores customer service, and they made time for me, even if its busy... sale.  If they try to rush things, dont value you as a customer, dont know what their talking about, or dont seem convincing... hmmm ill have to come back next week. aka SIR."

289536,ch312,2009-01-08 16:12:00,1590," my stevens 200 (made by savage) 22-250 shoots under 1"" groups at 100 yards and its only $300 brand new.  as to buying the actual GUNS (bet you cant have just one) id visit any gun shop to find what you like and then order from SIR/cabelas or wholesale sports. even with shipping you will save quite a bit of money most the time. if you arent concerned about saving $$$, support the little guys.  for your first shotgun, id get an 870 express super mag combo. comes with a 26"" smooth bore and a 20"" fully rifled barrel to shoot sabots. mine has been through hell and hasnt let me down yet. it also shoots 2 1/2"" groups at 125 yards   and can be had for under $600. buy a weaver side mount so you cant use a scope with the slugs to get the guns full potential."
289548,diggyj,2009-01-08 17:41:00,548,Gagnon's in Oshawa.
289635,misfish,2009-01-08 22:47:00,29133," Yeah,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Just hope one comes by. Hanging head low.  Give Carl or Gary a call at the wolfsden."
