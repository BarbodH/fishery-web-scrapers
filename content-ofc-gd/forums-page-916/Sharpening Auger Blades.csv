288022,Spiel,2009-01-05 17:13:00,9065,"....Yesterday I received a PM from Efka asking me how I sharpen my auger blades with a Dremmel (he'd seen a previous post where I mentioned it).  So I thought I'd post it here in the event it may help others. I've found that it does a decent job for me and it's fairly straight forward.  I have an attachment for the Dremmel for lawn mower blades and such so I thought I'd give it a whirl on my auger blades.  The tools....    assembled and ready....    Blade direction....    So it's simply a matter of passing the blades through the guide several times to get it sharp. The blade in the picture was in bad shape before grinding, nicks, burrs and even a large chip. After getting the desired edge I then use a whetstone and/or  stropping.  The angle of attack differs slightly from the origional but I found shims remedied this problem. In my case I use electrical wire ties trimmed to size.  I found these to be better than metal which rusted and on accasion fell out. The plastic ties will slightly compress and stay in tight. Now I've been doing this for several years and I'm very happy with the results. I've also learned that it's wise not to lend your auger to the unexperienced and I also carry a spare (sharpened) set at all times. From time to time I have encountered grit, muck, sand and even small stones in the ice which of course will dull your blades.....Pronto!     I hope this helps Efka."

289050,POLLIWOGG,2009-01-07 18:26:00,835,"Guys used to bring them into machine shop and we found that they were knocking out the last bit of ice and changing the angle of the blades so they wouldn't cut well at all, thats why you don't lend them."
289145,Fish Farmer,2009-01-07 21:00:00,2234,Man!!!! Have I got a JOB for you  . My arm and heart can't handle my arger any more
289161,misfish,2009-01-07 21:27:00,29133," I hear ya there,and they think, yer being RUDE, when you say, NO, you cant use it.   Great post Chris.   I have found ,with the new finbors,if you let the augar cut on it,s own,and DONT let anyone else use it,it lasts along time."
289187,mbac31,2009-01-07 22:14:00,904,"I sharpen all my own blades. Saw blades and everything else. I have sharpened my auger blades better then factory ones most times. Trick is it takes time and the proper setup. I use what I use for my chisels. Its a sharpening system from Lee Valley and I can get any angle.  #1 tool- Bevel Guage #2 this set I use the most   http://www.leevalley.com/wood/page.aspx?c=...t=1,43072,45936  #3 this set  is probally the best one for me so far for more detailed sharpening. Little fine honing afterwards and the auger blades are good to go better than factory and only takes about 10-15 minutes. I use this one for the Jiffy blades only taking a little metal off at one time and the dremmel for the groved blades. I usually put a more agressive angle on them. You should see how my hand auger cuts. This system puts an edge on a fillet knife that I can shave with."
289473,Beats,2009-01-08 12:38:00,543,Great post.  I am awaiting my first auger to arrive and knowing I can sharpen the blades when the time comes is definitely going to save me some $.
