289067,kemper,2009-01-07 19:01:00,2232,"Good to hear that she is stable.  Tough little kid you got, my thoughts go out to all of you"
289151,bigugli,2009-01-07 21:09:00,6138,"Stable and uneventful are good words.  However, you have to remember to look after yourelves else you won't be in the best state to look after the little one at home. I know its easier said than done. It's a lesson we've learnt from far too many trips to the hospital with our daughter.  We will keep you in our thoughts and prayers."
289155,ccmtcanada,2009-01-07 21:20:00,7971,"Thanks for the update FNA....as you can see, there are a lot of us who are behind you and your daughter...and your family.  You all are in our thoughts...and like others have said, things look to be on the upside here."
289163,fishing n autograph,2009-01-07 21:28:00,2540,"Good news! Izzy's home with us now....but the cause of her seizures is yet to be determined. The doctor is having her stool and urine tested somewhere off in the far far place so it takes a month for the results...anyway, he's thinking it's gastrointestinal so he's waiting for the bacteria culture to come back and then he can go from there. But it's nice to see her home and back to normal....although she was in isolation and didn't get to wander around....  Thanks again everyone  Dave"
289165,pikie,2009-01-07 21:31:00,5,"We have been absent from the board for quite some time due to stuff.  But just couldn't resist replying to this one.  Agreed our thought and prayers are truly with you.  I  truly know what you are going through.  I know it's hard to believe now, but everyone will get through this.  She sounds like a tough kid.  Our best to your family.  My experience came many years ago.  When my daughter was about 18 months, we woke up one morning and she was seizing.  She got through that one after a bout in the hospital.  Fever seizures.  It just left me with many years of nights sleeping on the edge of the bed.  She has had seizures on and off through her life.  She was later diagnosed with epilepsy.  I agree it is extremely difficult seeing your child go through those.  My heart goes out to you and your wife.  (Mrs) Pikie"
289168,Rattletrap2,2009-01-07 21:37:00,1652,Great news Dave! Let's hope they get the cause sorted out soon so it can be prevented from happening again!

289032,fishing n autograph,2009-01-07 17:56:00,2540,"Just an update....well night #2 came and went. It was uneventful that goodness. Izzy didn't have another seizure but certainly hasn't been herself because the adavan that she was given. That is the most horrid medication that a child can get. It's anticonvulsion/seizure/tranquilizer that the hospital give children who are in the midst of seizures or about to have more. It turned her from the sweetest, happiest child to the meanest, most aggressive and frustrated child. She didn't even look like my little girl. But she woke up today after about 12 hours of sleep and she's back to normal...so they've rule out any brain function problems/tumours, blood sugar, illness and fever.......  but that haven't really told us much. Hopefully she comes home today. I can't take another night in the hospital. I've had maybe 6 hours sleep in the last 3 days....and that was all last night because my wife and i basically passed out from exhaustion in the same chair at about 11PM when izzy finally went to sleep...and we both woke up at about 5 this morning.  Thank you so much for all of your kind words and thoughts  Dave"

288499,GBW,2009-01-06 19:06:00,8460,"I am not one for prayers either but I did say one for you and your family today when I read this. I have 2 kids, 5 and 2 and my 2-year old son is sick right now and the Dr's are not sure what is wrong with him either so I kind of feel what you are going through.  Be strong as I'm sure Izzy's looking to her daddy for strength."
288529,ccmtcanada,2009-01-06 20:25:00,7971,"Our thoughts and prayers are with you during this time.  Reminds me of when my daughter had an ultrasound done because of some issues she was having...she was about 3 at the time...  The ultrasound came back as showing a 'mass' on her bladder.  We ended up with an appointmen at Sick Kids in Toronto.  The not knowing is the hardest thing, but all turned out well in our case...by the time our appointment came, there was no sign of that 'mass' and she's been fine ever since.  Hoping it turns out the same for you...."
288533,Joey,2009-01-06 20:30:00,9122,"My thoughts are with you right now.  I just had a similar scare myself.  My mother was not feeling well for a few days.  She called New Years day to say she was now throwing up blood.  I rushed over and we decided to call an ambulance as she felt weak and thought she might faint.  Before they took her on the stretcher, I helped her to the washroom and she passed out right in my arms.  I'll never forget the look on her face.  Her eyes were still open, but she was not there, just a limp body.  I tried to hold her up but she was just crumpling to the ground.  I had her under the arms with my arms and called for the paramedics in the bedroom.  They came in and took her out of my arms and carried her to the stretcher calling her name the whole way, but she wasn't responding.  They took her vitals and her Blood Pressure was WAY too low.  They had to stabilize her before they could transport her to hospital.  They told me to leave and they'd see me up there.  That drive was the longest one of my life, with red lights lasting alot longer than normal it seemed.  Her diagnosis:  Massive bleeding ulcer.  She lost half her blood and needed 3 litre of blood and was in the hospital until yesterday.  She now has to take two different meds for that.  The cause:  Aspirin and blood thinners she was prescribed after her stroke.  She's only 69 and needs to figure out a whole new regime.  Does she take the aspirin and blood thinners to prevent a stroke and continue irritating the ulcer?  Not sure what the next step is.  I feel your pain right now and hope all turns out well.  Family is the most important thing.  Joey"

288337,fishing n autograph,2009-01-06 09:37:00,2540,"Hey Everyone,  The worst, if not the scariest thing happened to me this morning. My 18 month old daughter has had the stomach flu for the last 24 hours and hasn't been doing well. At 11:30 yesterday morning she had a seizure, which I know is quite normal in children, however, what wasn't normal, is the fact that she did not have a fever what so ever. So I calmly, while my wife was absolutely hysterical, called 911 and surprisingly the EMS workers were at my place in about 2 minutes. Well, we were in the emergency room and the docter had seen here even before i got to the hospital --horrifying that I had to have car trouble the second i needed to get somewhere fast. The doctor thought that she just had what was called a fever seizure and actually didn't think she had a seizure at all....until she had a second one right in front of him....it was worse than the first. So, after 4 quick hours we were admitted and brought to the children's wing....by then, Isabella was very doped out because they gave her antiseizure medicine that knocked her out for 6 hours, so she was quite groggy.....then at about 7:30 she had a third seizure.....  So now, the Chief Pediatrician has my daughter under close watch because he is really concerned that she has had 3 seizures in the span of about 12 hours, without a temperature or even a change in temperature. She doesn't have epilepsy and the doctors can't quite figure out what is going on. We're waiting until morning until she can get an EEG to see what's going on in her brain.  I'm trying to stay strong because my wife is losing it...as most mothers would. I've seen hundreds of child seizures at work, but you believe that this couldn't happen to your child. The look in my daughters eyes before she went into the second and third seizure is haunting me....i've had maybe 30 minutes of shut eye wife my wife and daughter slept and it's basically replaying in my head. Of all the things that I've seen and been a part of a work...nothing is this scarey.......  The scariest part is that my daughter is the strongest child you've ever seen...even drugged she gave the nurses a good fight. 4 of them had to hold Izzy down while they tried to get an IV going.  Anyway, I could really use your thoughts and prayers right now.  I'll keep everyone posted"
288340,Dnthmn,2009-01-06 09:55:00,128,The thoughts and prayers for your little girl are going out from me right now. By the sounds of it you got yourself a little fighter.  I've got a 22 month old little boy and I know how we were when he had his two surgeries. I can only attempt to imagine how you and your wife feel. Stay strong and God Bless.
288341,Marc Thorpe,2009-01-06 09:55:00,621,Good luck and may they find the cause of the seizures Know exactly how ya feel believe in good and good will come

288347,musky_man,2009-01-06 11:06:00,159,"FishnNAutographs,  I am no doctor, but you mentioned that your daughter had the ""stomach flu"".  Typically, but not always, particularly this time of year, that is due to norovirus (or sometimes rotaviruis).  Both can cause  severe dehydration in kids (and adults) and that can trigger seizures.  I am not saying that is what this is, but I would not rule it out.  If she had a lot of vomiting and loose, watery diarrhea, that might be a clue that dehydration might have played a role.  Otherwise, hope that things work out."
288349,fishing n autograph,2009-01-06 11:15:00,2540,"Yeah, the hospital already thought of that. The blood tests ruled that out. For seizures to occur from dehydration your body has to be completely drained of all sodium and electrolites.......  Another big concern with us is that Izzy hasn't peed in 12 hours now...and she's been on an IV since about 2PM.....something's wrong and unfortunately there isn't a pediatrician on duty at night here.....so we have to wait a few hours when he comes in"
288350,motv8tr,2009-01-06 11:24:00,2587,"My thoughts are with you guys Dave, but honestly, based on what you've said, I'd be booking it to Sick Kids...they have a pediatrician on duty...and even if they didn't, they'd likey get one out of bed for this!  Good luck and keep us posted.  Maureen"
