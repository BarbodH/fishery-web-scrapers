Four friends and I are planning to go icefishing this weekend and was wondering which lake would be a better option...Simcoe or Scugog?  We are planning to rent a hut.  Any info would be very helpful.  Thanks"
289404,blakewalk,2009-01-08 03:33:00,86,"i would check out cooks bay, but on the other hand, ciceri's report on tonight's pickerel looks pretty tempting !"
289407,Bondar,2009-01-08 03:38:00,817,Are you going with people who fish a lot or goingnwith someone who you would just like to see get into some for sure fish?
289414,fishingteg,2009-01-08 03:46:00,6,"Well 2 of us are avid fishermen, while the others dont fish very often.  I was thinking Simcoe for bigger perch, but i would also like to try to fish for some walleye/crappie and that was leaning me 2wards Scugog.  Tough choice. lol"
289438,ciceri,2009-01-08 04:35:00,535," LOL!   but i'd say it all comes down to the kind of fish. Scugog for Walleye, Crappie, and Perch. Or Simcoe for Whitefish, Lakers, and Perch.  Im not sure if Scugog has rentals, but its a very easy lake to fish. just head for the middle.  And Simcoe has a few, i know theres rentals in Beaverton, they might be able to put you on some fish."
289440,Bondar,2009-01-08 04:40:00,817,I would fish scugog !

289748,fishingteg,2009-01-09 01:56:00,6,"Thanks guys.  Ive decided to head to Scugog on Sat, and Simcoe probably next weekend.  We need to have a discussion like this when bass season opens. lol. Ill let you know how the fishing went!"
