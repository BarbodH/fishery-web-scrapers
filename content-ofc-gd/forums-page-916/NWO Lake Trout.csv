289290,trapshooter,2009-01-08 00:58:00,1234,"I made it back out on the ice today after spending 2 weeks traveling around for the holidays.  We found some access to Big Vermillion Lake, about 30mins outside of Sioux Lookout and made the short walk out.  No live or dead bait allowed on the lake and only 1 line per person through the ice.  We caught a 2 pretty quick in 55 fow, suspended up around the 30' mark.  I had another pop off half way up.  Plastics took em both.  They were slot fish so they went back down the hole.  We tried out deeper, tried spoons etc but the bite died mid-day and that was it for our action.  Had fun getting them to chase on the flasher.  The new Humminbird performed very well.  Had to play around with the transducer cable and the support cable to get the ducer to hang straight down (flat).  After that it was flawless.  We were also checked by the friendly CO Gal from town today.  Good to see them out doing their jobs and enforcing the regs.  Here's a few pics from the day.   my first trout of the season.  22""   graham scores on a tube.   my rig."

289325,TroutnMuskieHunter,2009-01-08 01:38:00,1362,Good report Ben....Nice lookin Lakers  What's your review on that new Humminbird flasher??
289333,trapshooter,2009-01-08 01:49:00,1234,"The bird has been great to me so far.  Love the large dynamic display for depth range (set automatically) and many other flasher functions and features.  It's fast, and has great target separation as well.  One thing is for sure, I'm going to put it through its paces this winter."
289370,limeyangler,2009-01-08 02:31:00,5204,"Nice lookin trout there Ben. Gawd...i'm so glad you got out on the ice again, i could feel your pain bro....it was excruciating!  I love the look of that Hummingbird flashr....just looks so simple and user friendly.   I almost tried the lake you were on when i was working at pelican falls last year, the boat launch before the little bridge on the Hudson Highway was 5 mins drive, but there was just to much snow last year, and the snowplows had built up a 10' high wall of snow at the entrance to the boat launch when i went (not quite ten feet high...lol...but close.)   Good to have ya back, its gonna be a good fishing season, a can sense it...lol"
