289233,TroutnMuskieHunter,2009-01-07 23:52:00,1362,Got an idea from another lad and decided to build this ice auger carrier for my ATV....works like a charm!  no more messin' around with bungies and having to worry about the auger bouncing around all over the ATV racks while driving on the trails and rivers/lakes...      
289240,Muskie4L,2009-01-07 23:58:00,3,Nice job Steve
289242,irishfield,2009-01-08 00:00:00,26272,Dang... knew I had something else I had to build before heading north....

289267,irishfield,2009-01-08 00:35:00,26272,Dang... you went fishing Terry? Where is the report....  Steve... what are you holding that auger down with?
289272,Whitespinnerbait,2009-01-08 00:40:00,2038,Nice job Steve ...   But man that is one Big Cooler your carrying around for a couple of hours of fishing   Like how thirsty can one get....
289273,Muskie4L,2009-01-08 00:41:00,3,  
289278,TroutnMuskieHunter,2009-01-08 00:46:00,1362,"Wayne,  I haven't used anything yet to hold it down...the majority of the weight is on the engine side and it's resting on the auger handle bar support on another block of wood which is hard to see from the pics...the main auger shaft is sitting down in a 3"" groove....I'll definately use a couple of bungies for added reassurance when the ATV is sitting in the back of the truck when I'm travelling down the highway, but so far so good....I hit a lot of drifts today on the river and the auger bounced a bit but not enough to cause me concern..."
289327,TroutnMuskieHunter,2009-01-08 01:41:00,1362, The fish get pretty big up in these neck of the woods Paul....I need THAT BIG COOLER to hold em' in
289420,Whitespinnerbait,2009-01-08 03:53:00,2038,In that case...  Sounds like Leechman and I should head out your way for some Walleye fishing soon
