289692,BUSTER,2009-01-09 00:37:00,1336,"i am a big fan of dakar and would just love to try it some day!!  $$$$$ is the problem,lol..  any other dreamers or fans of just watching?  i look forward to it every january."
289693,Fisherman,2009-01-09 00:38:00,7201,Definitely more interesting than hockey.
289699,jediangler,2009-01-09 00:45:00,1923,I was a big fan back in the 80's when I was still driving my bike. I'm not so sure about the move to South America for this years Dakar. I guess safety is the big issue. I always figured getting shot at was part of the challenge of the African race.
289702,mbac31,2009-01-09 00:47:00,904,I have been following this for years. Love it. I would love to run in it. Problem is I get lost going to the washroom.    I would for sure not take a navigators role.
289704,BUSTER,2009-01-09 00:48:00,1336,"what would you choose to drive?   bike,quad,car,truck,buggy?"

289725,Daplumma,2009-01-09 01:11:00,1961,"Love Dakar,wish they hadn't changed the coverage a few years ago.I like all of it.Too bad that whiner Robby Gordon is doing well.He will blow it in his own hot headed spoiled brat way soon enough.The scenery is kickass. Joe"
289728,jediangler,2009-01-09 01:15:00,1923,I know as a rider for more than 25 years that I would need six months to finish. I hate gravel roads let alone sand dunes. My choice would be the BMW GS.
289750,krawler,2009-01-09 01:56:00,167,"Im a huge fan too, been watching for years!  One of my many dreams in life is to race in the dakar, likely wont happen unless i come across a lot of money.  Id enter in the car category with my ZR2 Blazer."
289753,Fisherman,2009-01-09 01:59:00,7201,Dune buggy.
289783,Daplumma,2009-01-09 02:44:00,1961,As far as the bikes go....KTM. Joe
289804,mbac31,2009-01-09 03:20:00,904,Dune Buggy with extra roll bars. LOL
289809,Bernie,2009-01-09 03:27:00,3190,Ok ....You drive and I will pass you the drinks. I will ride shotgun. Literally
289818,Cudz,2009-01-09 04:00:00,2652,"I have met many of the top riders and drivers.  They are some very professional people.  THey really do look out for each other in what could be described as one of the most dangerous sports in the world. I have also eaten dinner with Juta Kleinschmidt.  She is an amazing pilot and actually won Dakar back in 2001. I have also sat in a some of the best cars.  I have great pictures I should share.  Having lived in Abu Dhabi and Dubai for almost 8 years I got into offroading (both 4wd and bike) in the dunes quite a bit.  I have watched the UAE desert challenge several times (that is where all the drivers compete), and have actually worked at and stayed over at the bivouac during the race.  To see these guys attack unknown dunes and gatch roads at ridiculous speeds is truly a spectacle that I recommend."
289822,irishfield,2009-01-09 04:05:00,26272, Lets go... I've got nothing planned !
