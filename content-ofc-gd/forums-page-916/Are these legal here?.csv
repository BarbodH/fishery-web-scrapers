289519,xeon,2009-01-08 15:13:00,350,"Yep there legal. I think ive seen them at walmart too. Also, I think there might be a thread on them somewhere, and there seems to be good things said about them."
289565,fishermccann,2009-01-08 19:44:00,655,"I have said good things about them, as I have used them with great results on both Muskies and Pics. (in the Kawarthas before anyone asks)."
