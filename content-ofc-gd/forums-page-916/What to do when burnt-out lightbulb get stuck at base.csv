289522,lookinforwalleye,2009-01-08 15:21:00,4399,"  Why anyone would spray a liquid into a electrical socket is beyond me, but if you decide to try that make sure you stick your tongue into the socket first to make sure the power is off!!!  Just kidding"
289527,ccmtcanada,2009-01-08 15:35:00,7971, LOL...now that was funny!  It's a little different than testing out a 9 volt battery I would assume!!!
289529,Rizzo,2009-01-08 15:43:00,4754,"good timing for this post! I had the same situation at home last night. I saw my wife about to go at it with the potato and I told her not to bother, I would mangle it out with some pliers"

289207,okumasheffield,2009-01-07 22:50:00,318,Noticed the lightbulb is stuck at the base when trying to replace it.  Tried turning it pretty hard and was afraid of breaking it .. not sure if there is any rust built up in between metal contacts  Any suggestions?
289209,xeon,2009-01-07 22:53:00,350,"If that happens, turn it as far as you can, if the glass part comes off, then take a pair of needle nose and unscrew the metal part in there. Make sure to turn the switch off first though."
289210,irishfield,2009-01-07 22:53:00,26272,Put a leather glove on or a good heavy rag around it and try to turn it out. Make sure the power is off. If it breaks.. let it. Then use a pair of pliers or side cutters to get a hold of the base and turn it out.
289211,paul_614,2009-01-07 22:58:00,168,"If your nervous using pliers, push a potato against the remaining metal part and turn it out"
289218,Jigger,2009-01-07 23:16:00,1237,paul beat me to it. potato trick works great if the glass breaks.
289220,solopaddler,2009-01-07 23:18:00,8605,"Yep, potato cut in half has always been my remedy to that problem. Works like a charm."

289243,Spiel,2009-01-08 00:00:00,9065,"....A word of caution, just becasue the switch may be off it does not mean there is no power in the socket. Best to remove the fuse (or trip breaker) before jamming anything conductive into a broken bulb."
289246,irishfield,2009-01-08 00:02:00,26272,"You got that right boss... especially in older wiring jobs, or "" weekend"" electricians work. I can remember at least 2 occasions that I've found the neutral thru the switch to a light and not the hot!"
289251,Spiel,2009-01-08 00:12:00,9065, ....Experience is a great teacher Wayne....
289268,irishfield,2009-01-08 00:37:00,26272,Ahhh... it only tingles for a MINUTE !
289304,Daplumma,2009-01-08 01:11:00,1961,Yup.breaking the neutral leg is a big no-no.Happens more than you would think. Joe
289368,bigredfisher,2009-01-08 02:29:00,300,DROP SOME COKE INTO THERE LOL THAT'LL DO THE TRICK THAT CRAP IS SO ACIDIC IT WILL TAKE RUST RIGHT AWAY
289382,OhioFisherman,2009-01-08 02:51:00,6623,Like others have mentioned shut the power off at the circuit breaker for safety. I used needle nosed pliers or needle nosed vise grips. The bulb base is just thin sheet metal and will usually break apart or bend enough to loosen for easy removal. Never had anything else break in the process.
289411,blakewalk,2009-01-08 03:42:00,86, hahaha! nice way to make sure the next bulb gets REAL stuck in there!
289416,okumasheffield,2009-01-08 03:47:00,318,"Wow, you guys are all handy men!  One more thing to add is that the lightbulb is up on the ceiling  Since I dont want to worry about when the lightbulb will break, would you recommend me to simply break the lightbulb first regardless? (ofcourse, I will have some kinda bucket below the lightbulb)"
289419,irishfield,2009-01-08 03:50:00,26272,Why I suggested wrapping a rag around it. If it breaks.. it's in the rag. Could hold a bucket under it as well...
289421,DRIFTER_016,2009-01-08 03:56:00,10439,"  Nah, just twist it like you were removing it normally. When they break they usually just detach from the base. They don`t usually shatter. But for your own safety wear eye protection."
289433,forrest,2009-01-08 04:26:00,1032,Had to deal with this once before so I KNOW the answer: I would get a few more newfie's
289435,jdmls,2009-01-08 04:28:00,575,"How many OFC'rs does it take to unscrew a light bulb  ....sorry I had too  Google is a great tool, if you happen to run into household problems like this again"
289446,young_one,2009-01-08 05:04:00,620,WD40? Does that work?
289449,Dnthmn,2009-01-08 05:11:00,128, Probably not a good idea to spray WD40 into a lightbulb socket  Between being flammable and conductive what would you prefer the shock or the fire?
289468,Greencoachdog,2009-01-08 11:09:00,8163,"The potato trick might work, I think that's more of a womans way to do it.  Real men use real tools and mangle that sucker outta there!!!  I hate being shocked by elecrticity... so I throw the main breaker to the whole house, just to make sure I get the right circuit!!!"
289478,TroutnMuskieHunter,2009-01-08 12:52:00,1362," I didn't know you were a ""work in the dark"" kinda guy Glen..."
289503,ccmtcanada,2009-01-08 14:39:00,7971,"When I was around 8 years old, my uncle was doing renovations in his basement...none of the switchplate covers were on.  He had this huge COOL electric train set down there that I always went to play with.  So, I headed down the stairs, knew where the light switch was and went to turn it on.  My fingers went inside the box and suddenly my whole arm went numb...I heard a buzzing in my head and felt myself vibrating.  I tried to take my hand out, but couldn't.  I then used my other fist to punch my forearm and it came out.  I sat there for a bit, went back upstairs and told my uncle what happened.  To this day he hasn't forgiven himself for that incident!  Anyhow, I have a friend who is an electrician...he does all my work now...LOL.  However, to keep this on topic, I do remove light bulbs that break off...I just use needle nose pliers to grab part of the base...the aluminum is pretty thin and pliable...find a spot and rotate it out.  I don't turn off the power to the whole house, but I use my voltmeter to make sure there are no hot wires before any tools go anywhere near it."
