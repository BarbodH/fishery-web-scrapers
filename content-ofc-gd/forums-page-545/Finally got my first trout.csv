578348,flyfisherkirk,2011-05-01 23:03:00,23,"    Hey Bud...Congrats! That's a nice brown...Atlantics have more fork in the tail.... Most of the tail pics in the pics are covered, except for one...and that tail tells the tale! Fred"
578420,TerryC,2011-05-02 01:21:00,196,There has been quite a few Browns from that area this spring. That is the fattest one that I can recall from there in a while.  Well Done  Clarence
578480,Live2fish85,2011-05-02 03:07:00,1633,"Thanks,I also looked up how to tell Browns from Atlantic. I am also going to get an Identification chart as recommened as I am new I am sure I can figure them out now but just to be possitive."
578493,miller,2011-05-02 03:40:00,223,"yeah theres some footballs around there this year, this lil porker i caught 2 weeks ago spat up 3 or 4 smelts that were around 6""  "
578556,Live2fish85,2011-05-02 13:53:00,1633,"Yea the one I caught had 8 gobys in it's stomach and at least 4 of them were 6"" as well I was amazed lol."
578557,Live2fish85,2011-05-02 13:54:00,1633,That's a nice one also Josh exactly where I got mine lol.
578605,Homer Is King,2011-05-02 16:57:00,305,"Congrats on the ""first""!  Must have been a thrill!"
577955,Live2fish85,2011-04-30 15:46:00,1633,Hey guys and gals. I just thought I would let you know I got my first trout today its was a 21 inch 5.5lbs Brown I am on the way home the day was cut short wife got called to work but I will post pics when I get back home thanks for the advice everyone.  Pictures below didn't want to make another Post.
577957,MCTFisher9120,2011-04-30 16:07:00,3761,"Congrads man, feels good don't it! I'll check back later    MTBF"
577976,Live2fish85,2011-04-30 17:35:00,1633,.  
577977,BillM,2011-04-30 17:45:00,17367,"Did you keep it?  By the time they get around 20inchs or so, it should be fairly easy to tell if it's an Atlantic or a brown.  When they are smolts they look extremely similar."
577981,irishfield,2011-04-30 17:52:00,26272,.
577982,Live2fish85,2011-04-30 17:56:00,1633,  Here are some pics of the Fish I caught I ended up having to clean it because when I netted him he was going nuts and snapped the treble off the lure regardless I will be having him for dinner. I am not to sure if it's a Brown or what I won't lie I don't know for sure looks kinda like a Atlantic to me as well. But I don't know I know Rainbows and others like steelhead but this one I'm not possitive look to light for a brown. Regardless it's a first whether it is a trout or salmon. It was a great day was there for a half hour and caught just this one. Then the wife got a call to go to work.
577984,BillM,2011-04-30 17:59:00,17367,That's a big fat Brownie.
577985,Live2fish85,2011-04-30 18:00:00,1633,So it is a brown well thank you for clearing that up for me.
577986,irishfield,2011-04-30 18:01:00,26272,Thank god for that eh Bill... I could just imagine the fireworks.  Beauty fish fella!
577987,BillM,2011-04-30 18:02:00,17367,The tail gives it away (as do a few other things)
577988,Live2fish85,2011-04-30 18:06:00,1633,I will have to research more into it like I said I don't know to much about them it's my first time catching a Trout and have never caught salmon either but I am hooked now I wish I didn't have to keep him but I wasn't going to let him go like that.
577994,BillM,2011-04-30 18:23:00,17367,You should definitely have a fish identification chart if you don't know what is what.  Keeping an Atlantic could have got you a big fine.
577996,Live2fish85,2011-04-30 18:27:00,1633,Yea I caught him in zone 20 but the size was a bit short. A gentlmen that was down there fishing said it was a brown but I wasn't possitive myself I did check my regs and that but I just checked a site out and learnt how to tell the difference of a Brown to a Salmon.  
578009,dave524,2011-04-30 19:04:00,4508,"Nice fatty Brown, and in my backyard too  if an Atlantic it would be OK off the pier if over the size min., but in the creek behind you in the pic there is no open season."
578038,Live2fish85,2011-04-30 21:05:00,1633,No I got it ff of the pier there was way to much going on at the pier with all the trees and that they were cutting alot near the creek. But I'm glad it was a brown either way. The reason you see the creek is because we were parked right by the launch and near the pier you couldn't even park there were a ton of cars that little building there is packed now.
578040,Leecher,2011-04-30 21:11:00,7832,Great job and congrats Chris on your first brown    Wow that's a fatty for sure Thanks for sharing Leechman
578041,miller,2011-04-30 21:12:00,223,"some group holds meetings in there, i'm not too sure who but certain days that parking lot is packed. congratz on your first brown. the square tail is generally a good indicator its a brown"
578046,dave524,2011-04-30 21:28:00,4508," It will be crazy parking on Monday, that building, the old pumphouse , is the local polling station"
578049,spincast,2011-04-30 21:46:00,3279,beauty brown - nice way to introduce yourself to the species
578058,beginner,2011-04-30 23:27:00,542,nice fatty... congratz go team 10 lol
578061,Live2fish85,2011-04-30 23:36:00,1633,Thanks guys. It was defenitly awesome to catch my first brown let alone trout. After seeing all the post of the trout on here and dying to get back out fishing I thought I would give it a try and now I'm hooked on it just as much as bass if not more lol. They a great fight and such a nice looking fish hopefully I will have more pictures to post soon and hopefully some bigger ones for our team.  Chris
