Basically, Obama addressed his birth certificate, his birth video, and the celebrity apprentice.  It's a bit long, but worth the time to watch the full thing, it's hilarious."

578673,bubbles,2011-05-02 19:24:00,591,That was great!
578684,ctranter,2011-05-02 20:00:00,543,"  Haha I hadn't seen that until now, and it was even better.  I love the blank expression that Donald Trump has while everyone rips into him.  Here's the best line from Meyers:  ""Donald Trump owns the Miss USA pagent, which is great for Republicans because it will steamline their search for a Vice President""  :rofl2:"
578772,tb4me,2011-05-02 23:05:00,3295,That was Great! I cant belive that guy wants to run for president..Good job seth!
578791,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-05-02 23:22:00,0,i hope he IS the republican candidate... how hard is it to beat a guy who has bankrupted all his own companies?
578839,Hellfish,2011-05-03 00:50:00,308, I have not read anything more true in a long time. What a schmuck. Unfortunately I do like the Celebrity apprentice.
