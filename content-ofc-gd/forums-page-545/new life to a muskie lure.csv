At 20, 30, 40+ dollars for these baits, a simple repair can add many years of life to them.  The weight difference in minimal (if really at all) to the baits, it doesn't affect them from what I've seen. The difference between the video and what my buddy has does is that he doesn't go all the way through. He will let them dry for a few days and then spray in the foam, let that set up for a couple of days, trim and epoxy. Might be more balanced to drill all the way through.  Good tip, thanks for posting."
