577831,splashhopper,2011-04-30 01:02:00,2931,I want to try using flourocarbon leaders on my braided lines for bass and pike this season.  What ways do u all join these two different types of lines together?   Thanks  Splashhopper
577832,irishfield,2011-04-30 01:06:00,26272,uni uni or a swivel.
577835,splashhopper,2011-04-30 01:09:00,2931, I have used a tiny barrel swivel on mono leaders... but can get it caught in the tip of my rods when i don;t pay attention.  I am a spazz at tying knots   But will google that one irish   Are there any other types of mechanical connectors out there that can be used too?
577838,kickingfrog,2011-04-30 01:12:00,8333,"For jigging walleye I use less then 18 inches of flouro, sometimes mono still, connected with a small swivel.  For just about every other situation I use a line to line knot because I find it is a huge pain in the butt to cast with 12 plus inches of line hanging from the end of my rod.  There are two knots I use depending on whether the braid/leaders are the same or different diameters. I always mix up the names of them but a quick search will give you the knots.  Some of the braids will have a list of knots that are recommend for their product."
577839,SRT8 smoker craft,2011-04-30 01:14:00,1107,what Irish said but remember with uni to uni the lines need to have similar diameters not lb test the smaller diameters don't hold very well if you match lb test or atleast they didn't for me after several lost fish I started using swivels again works with all sizes of braid and flouro.
577843,SlowPoke,2011-04-30 01:21:00,2984,A double nail knot works wonders on lines of different diameters. I use a tie-fast tool. You tube tie fast for instructions on how this knot works.... http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5b5b_32Cexs
577844,DRIFTER_016,2011-04-30 01:21:00,10439,I use a back to back uni as well.
577845,splashhopper,2011-04-30 01:22:00,2931,geeshhh ... now i am even more confused... I didn;t even think about a difference in diamater in fishing lines  Is the diameter of individual lines listed on their packaging and is there a preferred ratio of line diameter range to stay within when joining these two types of lines?
577847,mercman,2011-04-30 01:29:00,7054,Garry2rs posted a thread recently about a new knot for different diameter line. i will see if i can find it.
577848,SlowPoke,2011-04-30 01:29:00,2984,"  Braided lines typically give dimater OR compare to mono. Example ""30lb braid diameter of 12lb mono""  The double nail knot I posted is not affected by differences in line diameter. You can tie silk thrad to an anchor rope if you wish."
577850,kickingfrog,2011-04-30 01:36:00,8333,"You don't need a micrometer, and most lines will list the diameter of the line on the package, but you can usually tell just by feel if one line is thicker than the other."
577852,Bondar,2011-04-30 01:45:00,817, Blood knot
577853,splashhopper,2011-04-30 01:48:00,2931,  Where do i buy one of those handy little tools at ?
577862,SlowPoke,2011-04-30 02:19:00,2984,"I got mine at Cabelas for $8.00 I think... certainly under $10 They also sell a larger one ""Tie Fast Magnum"" and its great for the big stuff 50lb+ mono and fluoro."
577863,Bernie66,2011-04-30 02:20:00,123,The Albright is one of the best knot to join lines of different diameter. Just google it.  I dab it with superglue for added security.  Landed numerous 25lbs plus chinnies without a single knot failure last fall.
577864,Sinker,2011-04-30 02:23:00,8692,"Well, I guess I'm lazy, but I've been just tying an improved clinch knot, back to back from braid to leader. Never had an issue at all. Never slipped on me, and never broke off either. Works for me, and its really easy.  I tie all my braid with the same knot too. Never had it slip, ever.  As a matter of fact, that is the only knot I use for everything! The good ole fishermans knot!  S."
577866,GBW,2011-04-30 02:27:00,8460,"I still use the uni to uni even if they are not the same diameters, it just means one or two more loopes with the braid and as quoted below to help. "
577869,mercman,2011-04-30 02:32:00,7054,"http://www.netknots.com/html/albright_special.html  i just learned this one, and its a whole lot easier than uni to uni, at least for my big fingers"
577904,Roy,2011-04-30 10:46:00,13728,"I'd make it even simpler than that. The first post you say that this is to be used for bass and pike. Neither of these fish are line shy. No stealth required. However, if it's break-offs you're worried about in the case of pike (teeth), use a ready made fluorocarbon or wire leader. For pike I use 50lb+ fluorocarbon leaders, short ones for casting and long for trolling. If you're dead set on making your life miserable making knots in the cold, rain, wind and dark which you yourself say you're not very good at, then most of the above posted answers are good.  Good luck."
577911,The Urban Fisherman,2011-04-30 11:42:00,2050,I did this animation on a show this year... Might help a little.... I know ur supposed to use similar line diam. but all I had was 10lb fluoro last weekend and was using 5lb braid and my knots worked fine!  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TezYRYWkL8M&feature=youtube_gdata_player  
577915,Mike01,2011-04-30 11:54:00,378,"I use a uni to uni, and since I started using braid with fluro leaders about 5 years ago I have never had a knot fail, I have straightened a few hooks though!"
577972,cwpowell,2011-04-30 16:55:00,265,I love the albright knot for joining two materials.
577992,PikeMolester,2011-04-30 18:17:00,428,I use the Albright knot for this and different diameters as well.  
578017,EC1,2011-04-30 19:29:00,930,"Finally someone mentions the albright. My tip to that is to go 8 wraps one way, and 8 wraps the other way instead of 10 only 1 way.  The uni to uni really feels like you killed something everytime you reel past it, and cast it out."
