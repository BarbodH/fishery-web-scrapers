578319,Garry2Rs,2011-05-01 21:45:00,1425,"I have been out several times this week looking for Crappie.  There are lots of Sunfish, but fishing from shore I only found a few Crappie, and these were all around some very shallow weeds.  These were tall coontail type weeds left over from last year and pretty sick looking...  Today I got out in the boat with a client.  All my regular early season spots were empty early this morning.  We went for a boat ride and checked the back of a big windblown bay were I have had early season success before. Usually the first fish are behind a small island at the back of this cove.  Today the action there was quite good, and the fish were on the large size.  Interestingly, the sheltered area where I usually connect wasn't as good as a more open area a few yards away.  There are a series of docks there and it was on a straight line with the wind, and I think it was where all the warmer surface water was piling up.  So, until we get some warmer weather and some fresh weeds. I would check around any cover in the backs of bays that have the wind blowing into them. Garry2r's"

There was no wind to speak of, so I can't comment on your theory."
