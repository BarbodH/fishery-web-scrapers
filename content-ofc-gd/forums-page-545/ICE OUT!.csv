I expected another week at least before the ice started to shift with a purpose...oh well....not complaining. Now i'm really behind on my to do list!   GOT SOME PICS OF THE ICE COMING OFF OUR BAY TODAY                    <a href=""http://s907.photobucket.com/albums/ac273/limeyangler/?action=view&current=IMG_2468.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://i907.photobucket.com/albums/ac273/limeyangler/IMG_2468.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photobucket""></a>                        <a href=""http://s907.photobucket.com/albums/ac273/limeyangler/?action=view&current=IMG_2487.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://i907.photobucket.com/albums/ac273/limeyangler/IMG_2487.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photobucket""></a>"

578127,Joey,2011-05-01 02:48:00,9122,Beauty shots Simon.  It's amazing how fast the ice can melt.
578142,chris.brock,2011-05-01 04:18:00,4053,"yeah, you're lucky to live in an awesome place, we're jealous down here in the GTA"
578163,kenzy31,2011-05-01 07:49:00,261,song to go with pics  
578188,Leecher,2011-05-01 12:50:00,7832,"Oh ho, someone's in need of help with a certain todo thingy  Seeing that you are so close to water.... may I suggest that you go fishing in the morning and attack the todo list in the afternoon  Just a suggestion Jacques"
578189,Handlebarz,2011-05-01 12:58:00,3790,awesome pics you sure do live in a great place
578210,splashhopper,2011-05-01 15:33:00,2931,the pics are surreal....  Your little guy must really like ice fishing.... he even took a piece home with him
578225,fishnsled,2011-05-01 16:38:00,3520,"Great shots Simon, looking forward to your open water reports."
578269,Blue Lk,2011-05-01 19:02:00,337,"Simon,is the ""goon"" all ice free now?  I took these pics just minutes ago from my deck,it will be a couple days yet before I can do some trout soaking. The ice is doing a job on my allready broken dock,but it is on the list for this year along with a new deck at the lake.    "
578274,brad_001,2011-05-01 19:35:00,11,Awesome pics!  I wish I could have been at my cottage to see the ice go out this year....  to do list;  catch 1st open water fish of the season  ...........get on it
578339,limeyangler,2011-05-01 22:47:00,5204,   Hey Rick.....ice is taking a real beating this afternoon with the gale force westerlies. The whole bay is clear as of 20 minutes ago and the ice is gone as far as the main body of the lake....definitely done by next weekend.   IN FRONT OF THE HOUSE THIS EVENING AT 5:45pm      By the way....nice to meet you the other day at Crappy Tire
578422,Whopper,2011-05-02 01:22:00,2174,Good for you Simon but I was hoping the ice out in your area or just north wouldn't come until the 14th
578424,limeyangler,2011-05-02 01:25:00,5204,  WHY?
578426,irishfield,2011-05-02 01:29:00,26272,Phil loves to see the float plane pilot sweat while he lands between the ice sheets!
578429,Whopper,2011-05-02 01:33:00,2174," Selfish reasons I guess. I'll be at Little Vermilion just north of Red Lake for the walleye opener and from past experience the closer to ice out the better the fishing, or should I say catching."
578432,limeyangler,2011-05-02 01:41:00,5204,  ahhh...gotcha.....erm...you do know opener is 21st?
578530,Whopper,2011-05-02 11:25:00,2174,"Yep I know the opener is the 21st but I have a couple of friends going in a week early to harass the pike before I get there, I guess I'll have some catching up to do"
