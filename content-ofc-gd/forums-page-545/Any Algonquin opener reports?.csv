578156,Live2fish85,2011-05-01 04:43:00,1633,They just opened the back country this weekend. So I'm sure there will be some soon.
578200,jedimaster,2011-05-01 14:39:00,3472, Went yesterday. Some of the lakes still have ice on them. The lake we went to was still partially ice covered and the fish were shut down big time. Just wait a few more weeks. The fishing picks 3 or 4 weeks after the ice melts once the water warms up. The rivers are flowing like made and are very dangerous right now. Like scary dangerous. The water flow is substantial. The trails were ices and snow packed in the morning and deep mud and ice in the afternoon.
578314,brkygetr,2011-05-01 21:30:00,425,Heading in on Thurs...should be interesting to say the least. Will report when I get back...
578317,trevy727,2011-05-01 21:36:00,351,I'm also heading in Thursday. Been watching the ice conditions for the last 3 weeks. Getting very anxious. Can't wait!
