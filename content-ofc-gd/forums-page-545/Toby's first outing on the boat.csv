Well, he is back on the mend and is a happy pup again. With the nice day on Saturday, it was time to launch the boat for the season and time to get Toby on the boat.  He had a great time watches the floats and barking at the perch. He even decided to go for his first swim (thus the reason for the leash). Hope itâ€™s the first of many more trips. Here are a few shots of him.  Thanks for reading .    "
