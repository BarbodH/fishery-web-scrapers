569087,ehg,2011-04-04 23:09:00,2666,"They just added a muskrat and another crow to the nest. Now have a rabbit, muskrat, a fish and two crows in the nest for feeding.  One eaglet is two days old, the other was born yesterday. Waiting for that one egg to still hatch."
569118,ehg,2011-04-04 23:51:00,2666, All the cameras are off or out of season below the hummingbird. The hummingbird is constantly twitching and moving.  These eaglets are two weeks old and constantly being fed. http://www.hancockwildlife.org/index.php?topic=Ozarks#Ozark
569348,ehg,2011-04-05 23:48:00,2666,"The eaglets are being fed a white crappie right now.    The nest is littered with carcasses of rodents, birds, etc... they are only couple days old."
