577507,Mike the Pike,2011-04-29 02:30:00,3421,Hi guys need your help.I always bite the bullet buy my licence on line for Ontario pay a little more because I live in Quebec but I like the idea that I don't have to renew it every year.I purchase mine for 3 yrs unlike a lot of my friends.  Anyhoo myself and 3 friends are heading down to the Bay of Quinte for the Kiwanis fishing derby in early May.  So I need to know where my friends can purchase a fishing licence in the Bay of Quinte area we will be staying near Picton.  One of my friends is going to Ottawa this weekend so he would like to get the task over and done with.  Mike The Pike

577511,Mike the Pike,2011-04-29 02:33:00,3421, Thanks Wayne for some reason someone told me they no longer do this in Ontario.They stopped in QC.
577513,mercman,2011-04-29 02:37:00,7054,"The new Sail store in Ottawa sells them, and if you are heading down the 401, Ed at Paddletales in Winchester sells them too.   Paul  "
577562,Woodsman,2011-04-29 12:18:00,1286,"Wrong. Not all Canadian Tire stores in Ontario sell them. Most do, but a few don't. My local C.T. store in St. Marys doesn't."
577651,Hooked,2011-04-29 16:34:00,891, I heard the same thing about CT's not providing fishing licenses anymore.  But the CT in Nappanee use to anyways.  You can also try Baker's in Nappanee.
577652,ADB,2011-04-29 16:40:00,444, Yup.  The one close to me stopped as well (Richmond Hill).  It seems they can't be bothered with the paperwork anymore.  I'd advise calling ahead...although you'd think stores near Quite would still do it considering how close they are to the water.
577656,Raf,2011-04-29 16:45:00,3495,"yes, i'd call ahead.  i suspect it's more common (that they don't sell them) in the big smoke but some CTs don't sell them anymore."
577668,[emailÂ protected],2011-04-29 17:13:00,97,Your best bet for purchasing a license in O-town would be Le Barons (1512 Merivale Road). You have to go on a hunt to find a CT over here that sells them.
577789,cranks bait,2011-04-29 23:09:00,721,Try calling the Canadian Tire in Picton.  I'm sure they still sell them because of the influx of fishing there.  I know Brockville and Kingston still sell them as well.
578870,superdad,2011-05-03 01:37:00,353,Mike the P  Guess it's a tad late to buy it on-line??  You could check and see what you can do.  David  aka  Superdad
