577874,GBW,2011-04-30 03:00:00,8460,"So I just got a few pic's sent to me, sans motor, of my 'new to me' boat.  My dad got this boat, trailer and motor (missing in pic as it's locked away) off a friend of his looking to upgrade.  This is for me to build a casting deck on the front and put a trolling motor up there as well as my new fishing boat.  I'm sure some of you have seen some of these but thise one still floats and doesn't leak!!  I cannot wait to get it out on the water!!!!      I may need new rubber for the wheels so anyone got a connection?  CHEERS!  Geoff"
577877,BFSC Kevin,2011-04-30 03:05:00,1351,Grats.   It is always fun to play with something new.   but isn't this boat around the same as the one you sold?
577881,Joey,2011-04-30 03:17:00,9122,"Sweet, looks good"
577891,skeeter,2011-04-30 03:39:00,1907,"What the heck is a ""sans motor"" and ""botat""???  When your building the casting deck, you might want to add a floor in it as well. It keeps your feet dry and makes standing and getting in/out a lot easier."
577892,HTHM,2011-04-30 03:44:00,4082,That is a classic!

577906,lookinforwalleye,2011-04-30 10:54:00,4399,Try Princess Auto for the new tires!
577921,The Urban Fisherman,2011-04-30 12:12:00,2050,Awesome Bud!  Looks Mint to! Congrats!
577929,mercman,2011-04-30 13:00:00,7054,"Nice Geoff! Looks like a good solid boat.Its deep too Congrats Bud !!!  Skeets   the word ""SANS"" means without, in French...the word ""MOTOR"" is english for ""MOTEUR"" in french. Botat is......................................... Look it up in your Funk and Wagnall."
577930,ckrb2007,2011-04-30 13:34:00,449,"Nice little runner!! As for the tires, like another member said....try ""the Princess"" for new tires. I'm actually heading there right now to get a spare for my ATV trailer."
577936,pikehunter,2011-04-30 13:55:00,1659,"That is in nice condition! A good sound purchase from the look of your pictures. Remember adding a deck or floor is going to add weight and you are going to lower the carrying capcity.  Princess Auto does have decent tire prices, but only if there is a store close to you."
577937,skeeter,2011-04-30 13:56:00,1907,Princess auto is the place to get tires and rims from. Check there site to see if the size you need is on sale.  the 4.80 x 12 are on sale right now. Tire and rim $55.oo reg $89.99
577951,GBW,2011-04-30 15:29:00,8460,"thanks all and yes Kevin this is just like what I sold (yes, it is now sold) but a but of a deeper V."
577952,Billy Bob,2011-04-30 15:33:00,5865,"Yep, that there is one fine FISHING BOAT...."
577960,MCTFisher9120,2011-04-30 16:13:00,3761,"Not sure if putting a deck in is in your plans but make this into a mod thread, always like seeing projects coming together.  MTBF"
