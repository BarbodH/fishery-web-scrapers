578179,scugpg,2011-05-01 12:23:00,1373,Had a chance to get out on the Detroit River with a buddy and Bob Devine from Chartertalk guide service. Along with us and a few hundred other boats it was a slow morning until we cruised downriver towards the lake. Managed to boat at least 7 walleye and lost a couple others. The handliners caught the most fish from what we saw today and we did quite well considering it was a very slow day on the river. I also managed to get my new PB walleye at 6.5lbs. Thanks again Bob.
