575334,GbayGiant,2011-04-22 22:06:00,1780,Looks like it was sun tanning on the bank.
575376,Fish Farmer,2011-04-23 00:48:00,2234,"Sorry Miller, I know he moved up the ladder a the RGB. They could have changed his email I'll pm you his phone # He's a great guy to talk to."
578235,buick14,2011-05-01 17:08:00,741,I've seen them in etobicoke creek like that..strange indeed.
574412,miller,2011-04-20 03:47:00,223,"i nailed this lil fella on the 8th and i was sure suprised when i pulled him out. anyone else ever get any like this? the dark coloration was only on one side of the face, the whole other side of the fish was the lighter tone. he definatly seemed healthy as he put up a pretty good fight  "
574417,skeeter,2011-04-20 03:56:00,1907,Thats a one of a kind. Sure would like to know why that is!
574419,NAW,2011-04-20 03:58:00,4022,"Never seen that before, on any fish.  Very interesting.  Someone will know what it is..  I know..  He was cooking one of the Delicio Pizzas and couldn't take his eyes away from the oven window.."
574423,Muskieman,2011-04-20 04:01:00,2472,He just made it back from Japan.
574436,miller,2011-04-20 07:01:00,223, hahah great theory    i had totally forgot about that commercial
574457,aplumma,2011-04-20 12:10:00,6896,was the texture different between the colors?   Art
574460,Spiel,2011-04-20 12:26:00,9065,"I've seen it before, on trout and bass. Can't explain it though."
574463,Joey,2011-04-20 12:38:00,9122,"Very odd, almost a straight line, like it was dipped in chocolate"
574466,Nipfisher,2011-04-20 12:51:00,2449,Put his face somewhere it shouldn`t have been?
574467,ctranter,2011-04-20 12:55:00,543,  haha I thought of this as well.  That's really interesting.  I've never seen such an unexplainable colour pattern.
574473,Roy,2011-04-20 13:08:00,13728,The condition has been shown here before. I believe they called it hyperpigmented melanosis.
574481,fishindevil,2011-04-20 13:49:00,6254,must have been swimming around the outflow of the pickering nuke plant!!!....cheers   thats weird for sure...seem some pretty different colored saugers but not like that....
574483,miller,2011-04-20 13:51:00,223,no difference in textures
574591,aplumma,2011-04-20 18:25:00,6896, So much for an injury in a gill net theory.  Art
574669,dave524,2011-04-20 20:55:00,4508,"Pretty obvious, it's a male and only half spent, so only half still in spawning colours  put him back so he can complete his job and he will turn all chrome and drop back to the lake"
574711,TerryC,2011-04-20 23:21:00,196,"Hey, nice to see my personal bait man on OFC.    I saw this fish first hand, and it was strange indeed.  Why don't you tell everyone about the huge one you lost right after that one.  Nice Browns on the other post as well.  Cheers,  Terry"
574714,GBW,2011-04-20 23:28:00,8460,did you use that minnow dip Cronzy promoted in the past on this fish to catch a biagger one?
574772,miller,2011-04-21 03:07:00,223," i'm trying to forget about that one, its still haunting me though   lol"
