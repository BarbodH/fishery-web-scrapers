567487,umKthxbye,2011-03-30 11:57:00,247,Yeah navigon is the BEST gps ever. Ive tried the tom-tom and it sucked.
567508,Governator,2011-03-30 13:13:00,879,For my bb:  Poynt Urban Spoon The Score (WAAAAY BETTER THAN TSN)
567569,aplumma,2011-03-30 18:46:00,6896,  Thats a shame down here in the States TomTom is great.   Art

567710,jjcanoe,2011-03-31 01:54:00,744," Splashhopper, What you really need is the ""water activated self-inflating BlackBerry PFD app"""
567727,splashhopper,2011-03-31 02:37:00,2931, Yep... one in the river.... one in the toilet....that's two in six months....
567737,splashhopper,2011-03-31 02:57:00,2931,  It's so easy to use dave... even I got it figured out in one day

566537,jjcanoe,2011-03-27 17:40:00,744,"Anyone have any favorite FREE apps for their smartphones? Here's mine for my new BlackBerry,  QR Code reader It's worked great everytime for me (so far) and saves you time when you download new apps. You don't even need to log in to BB appworld to use it!  Make sure you post what system they are on and make sure they are FREE ones!  jjcanoe"
566543,HTHM,2011-03-27 18:02:00,4082,"Mine has to be Poynt, a telephone book and gps/map rolled into one."
566566,Grimace,2011-03-27 18:59:00,2020,Canadian Tire app is incredible.  You can scan products with your camera and it tells you if Canadian tire has it cheaper and where the nearest store to you is and if it is in stock.  Pretty slick.
566600,SlowPoke,2011-03-27 20:16:00,2984,My favourite has to be the phone app. It allows you to punch in 10 digits and talk to someone.
566617,Twocoda,2011-03-27 20:37:00,4130,weather network seems to be the one i cant live without...dam...im officially OLD!
566619,danbouck,2011-03-27 20:41:00,4380,Weather network and Crunch SMS for blackberry. Crunch SMS sorts all texts by sender which is great.
566653,bassjnkie,2011-03-27 22:14:00,1101,favorite has to be Flick Fishing.
566654,umKthxbye,2011-03-27 22:18:00,247,Mine are Cydia and installous for iPhone.
566656,irishfield,2011-03-27 22:22:00,26272, ... mine does text as well !
566673,backbay,2011-03-27 23:19:00,773,Probably Skype for me
566674,NateFollmer,2011-03-27 23:24:00,19,Catch Notes and My Tracks for android. Makes logging trips a breeze.
566734,muskymike,2011-03-28 01:45:00,772," JJ, whats the point of the code reader? I mean what benefit does it have? I have never used, nor thought I needed it, but now after going onto App World, I could see this being useful if its what I think it is for."
566735,BillM,2011-03-28 01:48:00,17367, I use this all the time.  Got all my fav steelhead spots on it
566759,jjcanoe,2011-03-28 03:47:00,744," The biggest benefit I find with it is you don't have to re-log in each time (or at all) when you download an app from bb appworld, just pull out your phone and scan the QR code at the bottom of the app, it loads it on your phone and sets it up automatically for you.  big time saver if you're planning on downloading a bunch of apps. 2 touches on your phone and your done (1. open code reader, it then scans the code automatically using you camera 2. set trusted app status, & you're done!)"
566760,jjcanoe,2011-03-28 03:50:00,744,"I've got Weather Eye, and the Canadian tire app as well. Use Weather Eye a lot, but haven't tried the Canadian Tire app yet."
566766,Twocoda,2011-03-28 04:01:00,4130,Dan i just put the Crunch on my phone...here comes another learning curve..
566802,rbaquial,2011-03-28 12:15:00,968,"Password Keeper for Android. Stores all your passwords and usernames for any application/website you need. Requires a Master Password to login, It's very useful!  Does anyone know of an app that has/is a TOPOGRAPHICAL map? I know the guys from G2 Angling have it... Just don't know what it's called. :s Anyone?"
566827,quickme,2011-03-28 14:07:00,261,IPhone  Topographic Maps Canada - Free and doesn't use data.  You download once and its stored Pudding Camera - its in Korean but one of the best Photo apps i've played with.  Its not hard to figure out. CamScanner - I use this for work all the time.  If you have a contract/paperwork that you need to send and can't find a fax you take a picture and it converts it into a .PDF and you can email it. ( be careful cuz it does use a lot of data) Skype - avoid Long distance charges when there is Free WiFi available  Hope these help everyone out a bit.   Nick
