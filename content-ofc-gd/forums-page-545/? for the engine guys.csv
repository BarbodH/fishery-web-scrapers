Now what I was thinking of doing is adding an elctric fuel pump in line with the mechanical pump. Reason being is, it has a filter housing attached to the pump, and its easier to hook up the new one in line with it. Will it effect the fuel delivery in any way to the carb? Build up too much pressure? The other thing I can do is cut off the lever on the original pump, that way there arent any issues. But I prefer not to do that. Thanks in advance V  "

Another issue is you really have no redundancy as if the mechanical pump blows a diaphram.. all the electric is going to do is spray fuel faster thru it and out the vent hole. I prefer a parallel dual fuel pump set up, but it requires check valves to make if function properly and safely.  Still not sure I understand why you're doing this? The filter is built into the electric pump??.. why not just install a filter if that's what you're really after?"
578016,DRIFTER_016,2011-04-30 19:27:00,10439,If you want an electric fuel pump just purchase a cover plate and new gasket to block off the mechanical fuel pump opening. If you are just looking for a filter just purchase one of These and plumb it inline. The added bonus is it's also a water separator.
578037,Bernie,2011-04-30 21:04:00,3190,I seen a car one time that someone added an electric fuel pump to. The engine backfired and stalled due to a stuck open needle valve in the carb. Because the fuel pump was wired to ignition on the pump continued to run and the engine took fire. The lady panicked and left the ignition on. They wrote off the car.  Make sure any electric fuel pump shuts off if the engine isn't running. The best way is to wire it to an oil pressure switch. But the pump still needs to operate when cranking so a relay hooked into the crank circuit is the best option.  I'd just leave it alone and leave it the way it should be originally. They worked well enough.
