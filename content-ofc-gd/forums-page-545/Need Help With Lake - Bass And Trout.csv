I've tried to do some research and as far as I know, the only fish species in the lake is smallmouth bass, yellow perch, rainbow trout, lake trout, brook trout, lake herring, golden shiners, and white suckers. I'm use to fishing in places like Georgian Bay where there is multiple species like largemouth bass, and pike.  How should I approach this lake?  Ive never fished for Trout before, but the SM Bass should be fairly easy.   Thanks!"

578221,Live2fish85,2011-05-01 16:18:00,1633,Remember to that Bass aren't in season until 4th sat in june so I would stick to targeting trout.
578249,LegitFish,2011-05-01 17:36:00,69, Oh thanks alot!
578250,LegitFish,2011-05-01 17:36:00,69, I wont be up there till mid July
578259,Mike01,2011-05-01 18:10:00,378,"Did you get the species info from the MNR website, if so it's not always that accurate.  Most of those surveys were done back in the 70's."
578275,LegitFish,2011-05-01 19:49:00,69," I did find it on a MNR document, but I didnt see a date..."
578349,Mike01,2011-05-01 23:06:00,378,"I would see if you can find a local bait shop and give them a call, explain your situation and I'm sure they'd help you out."
578351,BillM,2011-05-01 23:17:00,17367,Call the regional MNR office and ask to speak with the fisheries biologist..
578669,jimmer,2011-05-02 19:07:00,2730,See if there is a stocking list for the lake. That will give you a better understanding of the fish populations. The trout will probably be deeper or suspended over deep water in July.
