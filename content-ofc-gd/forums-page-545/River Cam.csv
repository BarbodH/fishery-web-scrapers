576245,Rod Caster,2011-04-25 23:55:00,5784,  Is that what the black blob is? too funny
576264,Live2fish85,2011-04-26 00:39:00,1633,I think I am going to Cancel my cable this is much more exciting even my wife who cares less about fishing is watching it lol.
576529,bucktail,2011-04-26 22:41:00,1857,"  This cam is awesome!!!! In 20 minutes I have seen about 10 suckers, somekind of newt or salamander and 2 huge sturgeon!!!!!!!"
577325,MJIG,2011-04-28 20:41:00,227,"Something bonked the camera and at the moment it is pointing down-current so the fish are approaching the camera head-on. Personally, I think it's less effective for identification and sizing that way.  Wolf River Cam  --"
577329,BillsTheBassMan,2011-04-28 20:53:00,932,That camera is a good watch!  If you look real close there is consistently something real big hanging out in the background (4:55).  It has appeared 3 or 4 times.
577632,ChrisK,2011-04-29 15:55:00,2772,It came in close for a bit. Twas a Sturgeon
577658,Pikeslayer,2011-04-29 16:51:00,1443,I saw a pair of reading glasses tumble by. SKEETER ????  
577673,fishnsled,2011-04-29 17:20:00,3520,"Suckers, walleye, carp, sturgeon was in and out for quiet some time and a whitefish. All in about 10 minutes."
577919,kickingfrog,2011-04-30 12:06:00,8333,Busy night. One camera appears to be turned around and I think the sturgeon getting frisky with one of the others.
578215,kickingfrog,2011-05-01 15:49:00,8333,This camera has strurgeon spawning right now:  http://wolfrivercam.com/Shiocton%20Cam%202.html
578217,splashhopper,2011-05-01 16:01:00,2931, would running this all the time kill your allotted download quota from your ISP ?
578357,Muskieman,2011-05-01 23:38:00,2472,  There must be 6 Sturgeon kickin up silt right now////  19:37pm VERY VERY COOL!!!  Randy from STURGEON  
578381,kickingfrog,2011-05-02 00:14:00,8333,"That's not silt, but it does rhyme with it."
578388,Muskieman,2011-05-02 00:27:00,2472,I think that Camera #2 is now pregnant.
575914,MJIG,2011-04-25 00:25:00,227,"It isn't as interesting as the eagle nest cam because sometimes you only see water, but there's an underwater river cam here: Wolf River cam  I watched the odd sucker swim by while I was watching, but a few minutes ago a huge sturgeon swam right by the camera!   --"
575921,Live2fish85,2011-04-25 00:42:00,1633,"That's pretty cool I just watched it for a few mins and seen a walleye, sucker and a big Sheap head, I could watch this all night lol."
575923,Live2fish85,2011-04-25 00:47:00,1633,There is lots of action right now check it out.
575924,Muskieman,2011-04-25 00:53:00,2472,Now that is cool...
575927,Muskieman,2011-04-25 00:58:00,2472,That Sturgeon likes to kick up the silt...
575929,MJIG,2011-04-25 01:02:00,227, I saw that too. I also notice that it's getting harder to see fish outside the range of the light of the camera now that darkness is settling in. There seems to be quite a variety of species in that river.   --
575933,Muskieman,2011-04-25 01:10:00,2472,"  so far I've got a Sturgeon , a bunch of Walleye ,, some Sucker and a Smallie"
575935,Live2fish85,2011-04-25 01:16:00,1633,"Yea I can't stop watching, this is awesome lol. It's exciting just waiting to see what's next lol."
575963,Joey,2011-04-25 02:10:00,9122,Pretty cool indeed.  That sturgeon is great
575967,muskymike,2011-04-25 02:13:00,772,"Awesome, I think I saw debris, couldn't make it out. I'm going to watch this just to see what happens."
575968,MJIG,2011-04-25 02:17:00,227,Did anyone see that big sturgeon with the lamprey attached a few minutes ago? That was pretty hideous looking.  --
576089,Terry,2011-04-25 14:57:00,14456,been watching an hour..not a damn thing....LOL
576095,MJIG,2011-04-25 15:13:00,227," Some observations: - As Terry noted, this time of day seems to have less fish traffic than later in the afternoon and just before dusk yesterday (just like fishing). - Species seen so far: Sturgeon, Walleye, Sucker, Smallmouth Bass, Sheepshead, Lamprey, Carp (any others?) - A snail decided to clean the camera and blocked most of the view for a while earlier this morning LOL."
576112,Muskieman,2011-04-25 15:56:00,2472,I think that there was a Small Pike or Chain Pickerel sitting there at about 5:30 this morning.
576113,Terry,2011-04-25 15:59:00,14456,I saw carp  then sucker  then walleye
576116,fishnsled,2011-04-25 16:19:00,3520,  Me too and a Sturgeon!
576117,Twocoda,2011-04-25 16:23:00,4130,i seen them too...who needs a fish tank eh ....  i think im going to keep this going all the time to act as a screen saver...  nice find!!!  Cheers
576126,MJIG,2011-04-25 16:58:00,227,Another species sighted: Johnny Darter (although I don't expect the poor little guy to last long among some of those predators)  --
576135,niagarasteelheader,2011-04-25 17:34:00,12,"I saw a big Sturgeon swimming into the current and crayfish that seemed like he walked out from under the camera! Also just saw something that looked like a whitefish, couldn't tell they flew through the screen but were big."
576138,gaspumper,2011-04-25 18:03:00,393,"Two weeks ago it was a steady stream of walleye one after the other,lots of suckers and one sturgeon."
576139,Muskieman,2011-04-25 18:07:00,2472,"will this work?

576142,MJIG,2011-04-25 18:18:00,227," No watching the river cam while you're driving though, okay Randy?"
576152,kickingfrog,2011-04-25 19:14:00,8333,"This link has been posted here the last 3 or 4 springs, but this is the first time I remember seeing sturgeon."
576241,Joey,2011-04-25 23:51:00,9122,Damn snail is back
576244,kickingfrog,2011-04-25 23:54:00,8333," It's movin', but at a snails pace."
