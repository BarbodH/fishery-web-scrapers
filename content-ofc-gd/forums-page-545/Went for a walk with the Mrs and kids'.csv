577954,GBW,2011-04-30 15:35:00,8460,"So this morning like most mornings my wife got up and went for a run.  Today she did a different route because she was with a friend who didn't want to go for a long run.  On the run she heard some splashing in this old dry run off bed so she looked and found some fish.  When she got home she told me and both kids' looked right at me and said can we go catch them dad?!?!?!?!  the Mrs looks at me and give me the    to head out, in fact we all head out.  Got to the spot and there was 4 in one pool and a bunch more around in other pools.  This is an OLD river and it only holds water with lots of rain and I have NO CLUE when and where (or if for that matter) if it connects to Lake O.  Needless to say we didn't have much room to fish so I brought my 7' spinning rod and here is the end result...    It's going to be a good day today and tomorrow as tomorrow thses go in the smoker..."

578052,Handlebarz,2011-04-30 22:24:00,3790,I took a walk along the Thames river and only found a pool of mud and some left over chicken nuggets I guess they can survive anything.  Very nice find and great day to get out side for sure.
