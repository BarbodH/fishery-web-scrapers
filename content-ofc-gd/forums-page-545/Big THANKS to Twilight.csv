578192,pikeguy,2011-05-01 13:23:00,195,The power of the human heart Is not measured on a meter But by the passion it has  The power of the human heart Can't be seen by the naked eye But by the effect it has  The power of the human heart Is not powered by a machine But by the will it has  The power of the human heart Can't have a negative effect But by the strenth it has  A power so great A power so full The visions it can create The visions intact You can't put on an act

577270,irishfield,2011-04-28 18:55:00,26272,"Picked a package up today at the post office and I'd like to publicly thank Nancy, on Jennifer's behalf, for the gift she sent her.  An envelope with a healthy handful of money in it (you shouldn't have Nancy!) and a nice fluffy bear, with a pouch for a heating bag in the back. It will help with the bone ache days that the anti-infection needle causes and maybe that heating bag can be frozen for when Jen's friends wheel her into TO's beerfest in her wheel chair this summer!   (we add humour where ever we can Nancy!)  Thanks from the bottom of our hearts Nancy, it arrived at the perfect time as the last two days Jen's been teetering on fever and we've all been up to 3am the last two nights. Today's she's back to normal and very tired, but this gift really picked up her spirit!    "
