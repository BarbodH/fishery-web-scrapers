577854,Roy,2011-04-30 01:49:00,13728,"I've stayed out of this thread purposely to just try to get an objective feel for it. This is a very important thread to me and it appears to have been important enough to others for there to have this many responses and views in such a short period on time. From what I've been able to gather so far is that for some members, there's a huge mistrust towards mods and administration of the community in general. We're all human beings here, we all make mistakes. Some days we're heroes (usually when we've done nothing) and other days we're zeroes. Those are the days when we will have made a decision. In a relatively large community such as ours, you'll never have unanimity...everyone knows that but we'll still try to do the best we can.  The distrust that I mentioned before shows up in statements such as ""they won't delete our accounts because it's a numbers game, the more members there are, the more money they make"". I'm not mandated to tell anyone any of this but I will tell you. Not only do we not make money on this community/board, mods must pay to keep up with ever growing operation fees. So you can understand how a moderator after having a bad day then getting raked over the coals by anyone here and having to pay for the privilege is probably not going to be in a good mood. I happen to know that every administrator including myself is happy to be here.  Another question is can we see things such as a PM or email message sent to someone else. Unless we sent the PM or email, there's no way that anyone here can see someone elses' PM or email. That's a fact. It'll remain that way for as long as I'm here and long after I'm gone because everyone feels very strongly about these things.  The positive side to this thread is that it seems to have gotten everyone talking about real or perceived worries that they have concerning the community. It's strange though that folks can talk for a year or ten and even go fishing with someone else in here then all of a sudden develop a mistrust. Some, very few but some are quite adept at getting people fired up about nonsense.  Let's at least try to keep this as a kind of a happy place. A place to talk, share stories, help others where we can and just keep what we've got here together and peaceful.  Have a good evening what's left of it and if anyone is fortunate enough to be fishing this weekend, GOOD LUCK and take lots of pictures."
577856,splashhopper,2011-04-30 02:00:00,2931,"Roy: Thank you for taking the time to post this courteous response to some of the questions and concerns brought up on this thread.  As you are aware, there has been tension building between some of the mods and some of the posters here for a few months now.  As a regular poster here since 2008, I have seen and experienced this first hand recently and felt that there was no recourse to be had when ambiguos decisions are being made by some of the mods based on the wind of any particular day at times.  As a community, there will always be disagreements of points of views and mis interpretations of intent via print communications.  I am sure that the fishing season itself will clear up much of this in the not to distant future.  Tight lines.  Ron"
577860,Sinker,2011-04-30 02:18:00,8692,"Well, I hope I didn't ruffle any feathers. I'm not planning on leaving here, never was. I was just asking an honest question, that I thought was going to be an easy one to answer. Sorry I asked, but it did bring up some good points.  I trust this site as much as any site, so please don't think I don't. I was just a little concerned when I asked a simple question, that there seemed to be no answer for.  I understand the Bull you mods must go thru here. Personally, I couldn't do it. I would just delete them all and be done with it  S."
577884,Squid,2011-04-30 03:21:00,1656,Very well put Roy.
577890,Joey,2011-04-30 03:34:00,9122,"Yup, well said Roy.  You guys don't get the credit you deserve.  Kudos to you all for the hard work and Bull you have to deal with sometimes"
577910,lookinforwalleye,2011-04-30 11:33:00,4399,"OFC is a great site and I drop by everyday if possible, I have been known to have the odd bout of temporary insanity and have had a post or two removed or edited and I would hazard a guess that said posts deserved moderation!  There are a lot of different personalities on this site and god knows I have butted heads with a few here but in the end everything is usually all good and the mods are the main reasons for this.I think they do a pretty good job keeping this community one of the best forums on the web!"

577922,Marty,2011-04-30 12:14:00,873,"The answer is very simple.   We run the show and we do what we believe is in the best interest of this community. We try to be consistent.    Nobody forces anyone to log on to this board.  We deal with many PMs to us by posters whining and complaining about our treatment of them.  Every one is sent a PM explaining our actions.   You may not like the explanation but you get one.   We aren't a governmental entity and certainly not a democracy and censorship is going to occur.   If we didn't censor your posts, we would lose many members."
577923,aplumma,2011-04-30 12:40:00,6896,"A nights sleep and a few P.M.s from some members has taken a lot of the bad taste out of my mouth from yesterday. Thanks for the P.M.s and the kind words. Rereading this this morning it still confuses me....people are mad because we treat somethings done by Mr. X one way and Mr.Y differently. It is true,and it will continue because their are cases were in the publics eye they are similar but on this side of the board behind the scenes we have received information that makes them different. If we did decide to hold everyone to the letter of the rules we would have eliminated 5 people just on this thread alone. I guess the answer is for everyone to stop comparing what Mr.X did to what Mr.Y did they are different and each and everyone of the actions the Mods make are treated as a separate but equal incident.   Art"

577925,bushart,2011-04-30 12:44:00,2628,Wow!!  Did I miss a meetin?  I participate quite regular here and have never had issues with admin or mods  TJ has helped me out with internet stuff out of the goodness of his heart---no fee.  Actually I look at this place as an escape to talk outdoors---I see and hear enough nonsense in the real world---be nice to keep it to a dull roar here.  And yes have mixed it up several times myself but try and play by the rules (Just don't tell me who to vote for!!  )   I believe all these mods are top knotch and have way more tolerance than I would
578203,jedimaster,2011-05-01 15:01:00,3472,"Even on facebook if you delete your account you delete all of your posts. Here I am a bit surprised you are not allowed to do this. If on any of the forums I have run (fishing, hunting and not either related) any member that has asked me to delete all of there posts I would. I wouldn't ever delete anyone elses posts that someone wanted me to. I have contacted people and said ""People are complaining about your post, I won't delete it but would you consider re wording it.."" or moved it to a members eyes only forum.  Although I may have run and paid for those sites. Its the people that contribute that are the ones that really go out of there way for the site. Not the Mods. That's what they signed up for or are what they have been paid/compensated for.  I don't presume just because they posted it on my site that I own there intellectual property. If I wanted to delete all of the posts I made on this site and the mods would'nt, I guess I could just go back and edit them all out with a deleted comment and be patient for google to re index the site to clear its cache.  What has left a bad taste in my mouth is the attitude of some of the mods here ""Its my site I will do whatever I want"" Weather it is or it is not, that attitude will always leave a bad taste in some people's mouths. That is what this site is known for, lots of good people, but heavily moderated. This is why I came to this site several years ago. When the ood forum started getting heavy into deleting threads posted about ofah. Bakc in the Ontario Fishing dot net days...  Over the years though on this site the mods here have become more and more active. Just like a referee in hockey a mod in my eyes is successful if no one notices them. Its getting pretty common here to see posts ""Watch out this will get locked down"" or ""this one is gonna get deleted by the mods"" That in my eyes is not good. Both fishing and non fishing related threads.  I personally like this forum and the group of fishermen/women here, but it's starting to get a bit over moderated in my eyes. That's when OOD went downhill, and it took a long time for it to rebound from that. I hope the same doesn't happen here.  P.S. many of the lakes are still frozen or partially frozen up in the park and the trails are nasty muddy, the rivers are way too high still to be fished safely."
578207,Grimace,2011-05-01 15:19:00,2020,"I too have groaned at some over moderation but you have to know that under moderation is disastrous, with trolls spouting off at everybody just to get a rise out of them. People tend to argue way too much and say crappy personal stuff.  I think they do a good job. If at times they over moderate you have to forgive them. The mods are people too and they also have different personalities and ideas as to what should be moderated and what shouldn't be.  That is why they discuss it in their back room lol.  It isn't the government censoring the free press.  It's moderation on a fishing board. I chuckle at the odd skirmish and have been in a few but at the same time when threads go too long like that it turns sour and everybody comes out looking bad.  Look at the trolls that took over the Simcoe board. We don't have that problem because the mods zap them.  As far as the erasing the account thing, I just don't know enough about computers to comment. I would guess it would be to document the ISP so you don't have jerks coming back and causing problems under a different name."
578208,splashhopper,2011-05-01 15:30:00,2931,well said Jedi
578211,Gregoire,2011-05-01 15:34:00,1397,"I take issue with people whining about not being able to erase their accounts. To begin with, one of the conditions of joining this site is that your account cannot be erased. If you did not realize this it is your fault. Secondly, in our day and age erasing an account is more of a symbolic move as anything posted on line leaves a digital footprint that can be traced and found. Arguing that you can erase your facebook account to support your argument is a faulty argument when you consider the massive privacy issues that facebook deals with. Event though this is a public forum it is a privately owned entity. The moderators control it. If you take the time to read the rules when you sign up this is evident. Don't whine because you are too lazy to read or understand the rules."
578227,Michael_Brown,2011-05-01 16:44:00,411,"I can't believe I just read this whole thread.  Nothing but respect to those who spend the time and effort to run this site.

578229,jedimaster,2011-05-01 16:45:00,3472,"So are you insinuating that because a person doent like the rules they haven't read them or understand them? The MnR and DFO control the waterways. So if you don't like that just shut up and take it. There are rules all around us. Change is good. I am not afraid to stand up and say something if I don't like it. As for facebook, it is completly applicable. You are given tools to protect your privacy, and if you don't like it you can delete your presence and not go back. Here you can't. That is a bit unfortunate. Its funny how people seem to confuse the fact that someone doesn't like a rule with someone that doesn't know the rules. I guess some of you are born into communisim..... I amsure that will get to some you.. Watch out this thread is gonna be locked.... I have been very balanced in my posts, stating not only the things I dislike but the thing I do like as well posting that ""they"" can do what they want. Its the attitude and frequency that I personally don't like. Now for someone to say if I don't like it leave is a bit silly. If we all had that attitude for everything we would all be at home staring at the ceiling all day...coffee too hot, too cold, speed limit too high, too slow, traffic too bad, work too boring, fishing not good, fish too small, too big, slot is too constrictive, not enough, don't want to register guns, guns should be banned,  all sorts of things big and small, we put up with the good and the bad. Some complain, and some try and change the system. Some just enjoy rolling over and wait for the rubber glove treatment."
578245,Sinker,2011-05-01 17:25:00,8692,"  Who's whining??  And I think you called someone lazy as well??  I have read, and understand all the rules. I have no problem with them. It was a simple question. I wanted a reason for me not being allowed to delete MY account. I never said I was going to, or that I wanted to, I just wanted to know why I couldn't if I so choose to. No big deal I thought  I think we have a right to ask questions about this board. We are here everyday posting, sponsoring, supporting events etc, why is it such a big deal to ask about it??  Seems to me like YOU are the one whining????   S."

Why does everything you contributed need to be ""deleted"" when you leave.

I think it started out as curiosity, then took on a life of its own, like so many threads do from time to time. Personally, i am just thankful that the mods are doing what they do to ensure that we all have a place to stay in touch with each other and share our stories and passion. To some, your job seems hidden in mystique and secrecy, and they were curious. it must be a royal pain in the   somedays.  Paul"
577840,aplumma,2011-04-30 01:14:00,6896,Ron it was a self censor I wrote it and put it invisible to think about it to make sure it was written in a positive frame of mind.

577638,jedimaster,2011-04-29 16:10:00,3472,"One way they could sort things like this out is to have an out of public view forum for threads that go beyond what they deem acceptable.... View at your own risk, not safe for work, grown ups only.... etc... lots of places do this now rather than close, or delete topics they just move them away from public eye and let the topic go on. Most here are adults and can handle there own... There have been lawsuits filed against public boards for violating freedom of speach rights. Its not as big of an issue in canada since we seem to enjoy being told what we can say.  A little bit off topic of deleting a user account, but my guess is the whole thing goes around wanting to have a bit of control over what gets posted and by who."
577640,Spiel,2011-04-29 16:13:00,9065," I disagree, posts are not censored, they're edited or deleted because they are outside of the forum rules.  If you post with respect to the rules you'll never have an issue!"
577641,Marty,2011-04-29 16:17:00,873,"The reason we won't delete an account is because as long as the account exists, we are able to maintain alot of information about that account which we use for future moderation.  If we delete the account, we lose the information.  There are alot of things that happen behind the scenes here.  If you knew how much we deal with, you'd know how good of a job the mods do at keeping most of our serious moderation behind the scenes.  Many of you throw the word ""censorship"" around as if it's a bad thing.   When action is taken against a poster or a thread, it is done with good reason. You may not all agree with it but, frankly, we don't care.  Our obligation is to the entire community, not just the few that, ironically, are the consistent whiners."
577644,ctranter,2011-04-29 16:23:00,543,"I think people take issue with the rules when some are enforced and others are not, or should I say, the rules are enforced for some and not others.  I don't want to start a fuss, but there were times when my posts were deleted for violating the rules, and other posts that broke the same rule were allowed to remain for whatever reason.  This is something I have talked to other mods with, and it has been settled, but you can't deny there are double standards.  One particular post about a idiot joke stands out in my memory.  However, as stated by everyone else, if you are not a poo-disturber, you don't need to be anonymous."
577653,Billy Bob,2011-04-29 16:45:00,5865, LOL.....that's what censorship is or at least I thought it was....so I had to look it up just to make sure...  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Censorship
577654,jedimaster,2011-04-29 16:45:00,3472,"  Editing a post is censorship no mater what the reason is subjective, favoritist etc....  I don't really care so much as its well known and accepted that this is the case here. Just don't pretend it doesn't exist. Its just gonna make people mad. Accept it and move on. I have a long time ago."
577655,Squid,2011-04-29 16:45:00,1656,Well said Marty!! Nice to see you chime in.
577657,Spiel,2011-04-29 16:50:00,9065,"  Again I disagree, if it's edited it's because you have trouble understanding the rules or believe they don't apply to you.   You can say whatever you want, make it intelligent, support it with facts, make it uninsulting and within the terms you agreed to when you signed up and you'll be golden."
577660,jedimaster,2011-04-29 16:55:00,3472,"  You may want to look up the definition of censorship. Your comment is exactly what censorship is. If someone says something that you or another moderator deems inaprpriate, inflamatory, dumb  insulting and you delete it, or edit it. you are censoring them. That is the definition of censorship. as I have stated i accept it here. As its well known that OFC will censor the posts here. You can't just call it Pike when its a sunfish because you feel like it."
577661,Billy Bob,2011-04-29 16:57:00,5865, I already supplied that link for censorship on the last post of page 2....but then there's the dreaded LOCKED THREAD option...LOL
577662,jedimaster,2011-04-29 16:59:00,3472,"From Wikipedia... ""Censorship is the suppression of speech or other public communication which may be considered objectionable, harmful, sensitive, or inconvenient to the general body of people as determined by a government, media outlet, or other controlling body"""

577667,jedimaster,2011-04-29 17:12:00,3472," Well what?.... Be censored..  Did I say anywhere I had a problem with it? Just because I said OFC and its moderators censor the posts doesn't mean I have a problem with it. I was defending you guys. After I went back and read over the flurry of posts what I take from it from the mods that replied back to me is...  This is a private board, We do what we want, when and how we want and you must only post what we deem appropriate or we will edit your posts, delete them, lock them and you are to accept it or else you will face being banned from the site....  It sure sounds like censorship to me.  Like I have said several times, you guys can do whatever you want, and I don't really have a problem with it, you guys foot the bill for it, do whatever you want. Shoudl I say it again?  The fact of the matter is the more you argue that what you are doing is not censorship the more it looks like censorship, and the more negative it appears."
577669,Billy Bob,2011-04-29 17:15:00,5865, I am not complaining or have any problems with the way the mods run the board...but I had to point out the meaning of censorship...

577674,Headhunter,2011-04-29 17:24:00,5703,"Because we are not capable of defining it by ourselves? Well, thanks for that BB! When you own the house, you get to make the rules.... when you only visit the house, you live by their rules... and frankly, I am glad that some things on here get removed or altered, saves me from getting banned for letting the offending party know how stupid they really sound! LMAO HH Ps... BillyBob... you ARE one of the one's that I like!"
577681,Grimace,2011-04-29 17:47:00,2020,"Look what happened to the Simcoe board after Sly passed away.  That is a terrible shame.  This is a well moderated board.  Jedi is correct in saying that it is censorship.  He also stated he didn't have a problem with it.  All he seems to be suggesting is that you call it what it is. Denying that it's censorship seems a bit odd.  Anyways, the board is in good hands.  We appreciate it."
577683,aplumma,2011-04-29 17:59:00,6896,"Why is censorship deemed bad? If you read the rules and you post as the rules guide you then your idea will be expressed in the words you posted. I have been here 10 years and never had a mod change any of the words I have put forth.  Everyone keeps saying we are here to get the numbers for advertising well look at the pages do you really see a lot of advertisers? Have you noticed that every event be it a charity or a death that the board OFC meaning all of the members here send money or flowers or something that they need to them. The spirit of this community affects all of us and it most certainly affects the Moderators here. I have over the years given to every cause behind the scenes and I decided I wanted to give something more precious than money to everyone here and that is my time and expertise. I volunteered to help Moderate this board and after a vote it was decided that I could come on board on a trial bases. The trial bases was if I wanted to stay after I saw how much time and effort I expend and the level of gratitude that it lacked. I am not looking for a hearty handshake or an attaboy for the work I have put in to this board but it does get old when you are damned when you do and damned when you don't.  Why do some things fall thru the cracks ? Quite simply we don't catch all of the rules that are broken because of time you see we have to earn a living as well as keep the board from getting into legal issues, internal wars, external wars and a whole list of things that ruffle feathers.  Are we perfect noo not by a long shot we will make mistakes as we go forth and me being the newest moderator I have made my share and then some already and in some cases it has made the job of the other mods harder but they have always picked me up and dusted me off and we continue going forward.  The simple road would be for us to stick to the rules rigidly and carry thru with banning and other methods of eliminating people who make ripples on the board. The problem is it would eliminate people who are just having a short spell of bad karma / insanity or plain bad luck what ever the name you want to use. We give them a break and we get accused of playing favorites. The truth of the matter is we did we gave someone a break because he /she has give us years of good posts and they have a bad spell that they have not made public and don't want to make it public so without the inside information you judge us harshly.   So the next time you want to judge the moderators harshly and think we are taking an action because we have the power realize the most important thing to us is keeping this board in good shape and a place were we all can meet and tell our stories for all to enjoy. The day that that objective can not be reached or the Moderators finally get beaten down from trolls or ingratitude is the day the board will be archived and a great place will be lost.  Art"

577689,kickingfrog,2011-04-29 18:14:00,8333," Agreed.  I've met a bunch of great people all due to this place. I've shared a beer, or twelve, and fished with a few moderators as well. I also understand that OFC is owned by others and they are allowed to administer it how they see fit. I may voice my opinions on how I would like see things done, but that's about it.  The strong connections and sense of ownership (right or wrong) help make this place what it is. Those same ties and feelings also create many headaches for the administrators I am sure.  None of us is being forced to be here."

If I didn't like it I would posted my nearly 1000 comments somewhere else. I didn't see too many people saying that the ammount of censorship here is bad. I do think and have for a while thought there should be an off topic section, but it is what it is."
577698,Guest gbfisher,2011-04-29 18:31:00,0,  It surely is a shame. That site died a horrible death only to be taken over by people who pray on other peoples hard work. Namely Slys hard work. Sites like that fail in the end even with moderation. I doubt anyone cares about how or who runs it now. I know I don't. It's not worth reading or posting at anymore. It died when shane did in my eyes.   oops topic change....lol....   Back to why the world churns.....

There are many reasons as to why someone would want to do this.  Could be to keep a larger list of memebers for advertising. Could be a half hearted attempt to keep everyone honest.  However, trying to keep everyone honest is actually a form of censorship. This board has a long and well known history of censoring posts. Thats why there are people that don't like to post here. Right or not, this is what they choose to do. There are a number of fishing boards where you can post whatever you want and noone seems to really care.  This is not the only board in town. I personally have no problems with them making whatever rules they want. They are afterall putting the effort and money into hosting it."

Since it is so obvious to most of the people reading this I am guessing Sinker is just pulling a shenanigans on us. If he were truly serious he would have P.M.ed us and asked to have his account closed.   Art
