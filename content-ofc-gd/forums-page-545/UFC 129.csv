578292,mbosh1980,2011-05-01 20:46:00,349, Were the two fights the ones that happened right as the event ended in the 100's? That was right below us in 239. I couldn't believe how long security and the cops took to get there. I'm glad I stayed sober as people were pretty chirpy and pushy after the event.
578297,splashhopper,2011-05-01 20:58:00,2931,My daughter thought it was a pretty cool kick too as she is trained to provide a vicious axe kick to her opponents face when the opportunity arises. (Beware teenaged boys that don't treat her with respect! )    She would be the cutie in the middle
578300,TJQ,2011-05-01 21:02:00,7806," Id like to see a more amazing fight, but when so much is on the line.. ya gotta WIN...."
578329,misfish,2011-05-01 22:22:00,29133, Why lose to a lucky punch. Good call boss.
578354,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-05-01 23:34:00,0,"that is why he is greatest technical fighter in mma i guess.  he is able to contain whatever opponent he faces, although shields caught him with a few more punches than koscheck did. i'd like to see him go up a class."
578365,Rob,2011-05-02 00:00:00,467,"  I was in the 200 level as well, the one I wore a little beer, the other was more of a pushing and shoving match and then security jumped in. Yup definitely too much boozy going on. There was some very interesting people there, but I think for 55 thousand people, overall it was pretty well behaved, and we have a lot more patriotic people in this country than I thought we had.  Rob C"
578389,Henricus,2011-05-02 00:27:00,118,"I was in 241.  Was 4 rows from the floor in Montreal when GSP won back the belt from Serra and got a sore neck from watching the giant screens overhead.  We learned then 2nd level is better than 1st...and you thought the washroom line ups were bad on level 2, imagine below.  Nice send off for Couture.  I think Hominick earned himself a rematch - the guy is all heart.  GSP was GSP.  Boring yes, but if you're Shields and you want the belt you have to take some chances.  Challengers have nothing to lose whereas champions have everything to lose.   You should see more chances taken by the challengers.  With GSP, opponents seem scared (and have every right to be IMO) but I guess that is in large part because GSP is just that good.  As loud as it was at the Rogers Centre, I remember the Bell Centre as truly deafening for the GSP/Serra fight.  All in all, worth the price of admission except for the $10.25/tall boy of Keith's"
578121,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-05-01 02:35:00,0,couture went down like a bag of bricks.  that looked like daniel larusso's finishing kick in karate kid.. lol
578122,walleyejigger,2011-05-01 02:36:00,876,"thx for the link ehg, truly appreciated,  great thing to find walking in from work, just in time for the beginning of the couture machida bout, a la karate kid, awesome, epic lol"
578124,Jigger,2011-05-01 02:39:00,1237,"  I said the same thing! ""If done properly, no-one can defend...""   Great win for Machida!  Calling Hominick for the upset."
578125,Guest gbfisher,2011-05-01 02:41:00,0,Ohhhhh....WAX ON......WAX OFF.....
578131,walleyejigger,2011-05-01 03:25:00,876,"mad props to hominik for sticking it out with his brains on his forehead, gross, great finish for him but too little too late, aldo was done, like a mannequin,  if someone on top of me is leaking that much i would try harder to keep my mouth closed lol"
578132,Live2fish85,2011-05-01 03:30:00,1633,Yea I agree Hominik showed true heart there his fore head looks like his wife stomach and he kept going.
578136,Jigger,2011-05-01 03:36:00,1237,"Wow Hominick is a STUD! Can't believe the damage he took. I think if he got his game off earlier, it would've been a different fight. Very entertaining either way!!! My hats off to him. I'm not predicting the next fight... WAR GSP!!!"
578140,Guest gbfisher,2011-05-01 04:12:00,0,Shields is relentless George is getting frustrated....lol
578144,walleyejigger,2011-05-01 04:19:00,876,"pretty boring fight but glad gsp won, can u say rematch, pretty big discrepency in the scores  thx again for the link"
578145,Dave Jones,2011-05-01 04:22:00,50,Homanic made a good showing could have used a sixth round though GSP fight was boring as hell (glad I didn't pay to see it)   thanks for the link
578147,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-05-01 04:31:00,0,boooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooring!
578150,BillM,2011-05-01 04:36:00,17367," Boring fight for sure, but who the hell would give two rounds to Shields?  This is why you never leave it up to the judges, lol."
578151,Twocoda,2011-05-01 04:37:00,4130,i agree Doc...but it was a historic night ...Cotures last fight and the elephant mans first...geez that looked nasty...i was expecting him to yell AAADRIAN!!!!
578152,Live2fish85,2011-05-01 04:37:00,1633,GSP won the fight easy but it was a boring fight as well but like he said after he couldn't see out of his left eye it was more just fighting defensive even he wasn't pleased with it.
578154,Cudz,2011-05-01 04:39:00,2652,Hominick is insane.  All heart. Typical George. Way more talent but no finish.  Same speech too.  I am sorry to da fans.  Jake Shields is very tough blah blah blah. I love George but ever since he got caught by Serra he fights the safe fight.
578155,Cudz,2011-05-01 04:42:00,2652,"PS. Who here was expecting that tumour to burst open on Hominick's head and his brain to fall out?  I was expecting his brain or an alien or something. ""Hey you Guys!!!"""
578157,Dan668,2011-05-01 04:47:00,1120,"Boring gsp as usual, he seems to do the same combos over and over. But after his eye, he just switched into defensive mode"
578158,Live2fish85,2011-05-01 04:53:00,1633,If I was GSP I would have done the same thing though it might not have been the most exciting but he also has a belt on the line and a huge check so easy to knock him but if you were in his shoes I'm sure you would do the same.
578176,MCTFisher9120,2011-05-01 12:13:00,3761,"My best friends uncle and nephew went to the event, they had floor seats right where the guys were walking in and out...unreal.If they took pictures I'll post them up !!"
578186,misfish,2011-05-01 12:41:00,29133,"That kick was heard around the world. Bet he learned that from Chuck Norris.  Boring GSP yeah,but Shields didnt beat the man.You got to beat the man, to be the man.  Question now is,whos next? Does GSP retire champ? He has talked about it."
578267,mbosh1980,2011-05-01 18:47:00,349,"quick report from the event. It is really weird to not have the commentary like on t.v. Holyyyy crap the speakers are loud in there....and a much quieter crowd than I thought. Meatheads + booze is a bad mix. Never seen a fight in a first aid lineup before... The girls there thought it was HILARIOUS to see the boys lineup for the washroom like they usually have to. Fight of the night was Hominick and Aldo for sure. Sad to see Randy go down in his retirement fight, but the noise in there was deafening when he was being interviewed. Standing O all the way."
578281,Rob,2011-05-01 20:16:00,467," I was there to, and the energy level at that event was amazing! Had 2 fights break out behind me  and many more elsewhere. Good time though!  Rob C"
578288,misfish,2011-05-01 20:37:00,29133,  Wannabes.Im not surprised at all Rob.LOL
578289,splashhopper,2011-05-01 20:40:00,2931," If the kick u are referring to is the one that knocked out Randy Couture, he learned it from Steven Segal  http://www.bloodyelbow.com/2011/4/30/2145727/machida-vs-couture-results-ufc-129-results-lyoto-machida-vs-randy-couture"
578291,misfish,2011-05-01 20:45:00,29133," You are correct,it was meant to be a funny Ron."
578007,misfish,2011-04-30 18:55:00,29133,"Main event,GSP,HE IS IN GREAT SHAPE AND ALWAYS SHUTS UP THE SMART MOUTHS.  Hominick, cause he,s Canadian and a machine. Should be a good fight.  The ole man will take Machida,got TO like Capt America.  After that,it,s all Canadian."
578010,Handlebarz,2011-04-30 19:06:00,3790,GSP all the way I hope you remember to let us know where to watch it online tonight as I will forget by then LOL.
578012,Terry,2011-04-30 19:08:00,14456,"I think this is GSPs toughest fight..  having said that, George is also one of the hardest training guys in the UFC..so each time you see him he is a whole different fighter...  win lose or draw..it should be a great fight"
578014,Dan668,2011-04-30 19:12:00,1120,"gsp, aldo, machida"

578021,mbosh1980,2011-04-30 19:43:00,349,I hope gsp wins or it will be an ugly crowd...that I will be smack in the middle of!
578023,Governator,2011-04-30 20:08:00,879,  Hard to argue this.
