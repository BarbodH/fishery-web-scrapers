575865,muskymatt,2011-04-24 21:22:00,2608,"Well I'm almost ready to start rebuilding, over 20hrs into it, a couple bandaids, beers and plenty of $#@&$#@ing....  Amazing how much you have to dismantle to change a transom, hopefully it'll outlast the boat when I'm done. Here are a few pics in reverse order    Finally out, some aluminum work needed to be done and I'll be replacing the inside aluminun part of the transom wall, it was too thin for my liking, the outside is still in great shape...boy did it need this though      Rotted, soft, stinky and water logged....brutal to get out....what a mess           Some pics of the old transom still in place, motors off and ready to take the bolts out     "
575873,Roy,2011-04-24 22:09:00,13728,Hard to believe how much rot is in there. Good luck with the re-build.
575877,irishfield,2011-04-24 22:13:00,26272,Tough to make a pattern from that old one!
575884,pikeguy,2011-04-24 22:35:00,195,"looks good u'r doing a great  job. Did my boat last year at this time. my boat is fiberglass , it took me 2 weeks of after work and weekends and my father-inn-law  and my friend that works in fiberglass."
575889,misfish,2011-04-24 22:51:00,29133,"Ya Roy, I was thinking the same thing.Thats crazy rot.     Naw.just go with a short shaft.  Good luck with the rest of the restor."
575894,muskymatt,2011-04-24 22:56:00,2608, Yes it will be...the bottom part will give me a start and I'll trace the back end onto a template and test fit until it's right. Nothing has been easy so far and I don't expect that to change  Can't imagine the potential complete failure from it being so bad. Being a 1985 boat it was due.
575974,HTHM,2011-04-25 02:25:00,4082,That much rot I would suggest you check your stringers too.
575975,Sinker,2011-04-25 02:25:00,8692,"What type of material are you building the new transom out of?  It will last another 25 years now, for sure.  S."
576007,NANUK,2011-04-25 05:34:00,797," I think that is an aluminum boat, there shouldn't be any wood stringers."
576025,muskymatt,2011-04-25 11:36:00,2608," Marine plywood, it'll match the 1.5"" thickness when epoxied together, and yes, hopefully it'll be like new!"
578060,livinisfishin,2011-04-30 23:34:00,661," Just wondering where can you get a sheet of 3/4"" marine ply from?"
578086,DRIFTER_016,2011-05-01 01:05:00,10439, Give Noah's a call.
578116,muskymike,2011-05-01 02:06:00,772, Where do you live? There are a lot of places that carry if it you know where to look
578130,dhickey,2011-05-01 03:12:00,1038,marine ply is not bullet proof!!! if you want to make it waterproof before instaling it you have 3 options.  1  you can ase exterior wood glue thined out with water 50/50 first 2 coats then 25%water 3rd coat 4th coat 10% water on the edges aply streight glue as final stage.  2 oil based exterior varithane on the first coat thin it with 25% varsol soak the edges liberaly .2nd and 3rd coat streight varithane.  3  wrap the transom with fiberglass. NOHAS can help you out with that.  fiberglass not only makes it water proof but adds stregnth.  any holes that you have to put in the transom during install should be filled with a water proof epoxy or glue or resin NOT SILICONE.
578164,livinisfishin,2011-05-01 07:53:00,661,"I am around Barrie, does home depot or your regular lumber yards usually carry the stuff or is that kind of plywood a special order?"
578231,glen,2011-05-01 16:58:00,2641,Last time i asked home hardware said they would order some marine ply in for me.  Or just use regular ply and make it water proof.
578237,Handlebarz,2011-05-01 17:12:00,3790,Matt where is the Motor  After all the work you did last year this boat will be with your family for life now.
578241,Nipfisher,2011-05-01 17:16:00,2449," Jason, Our RONA carries marine ply here in North Bay. Maybe one near you does too?"
578261,livinisfishin,2011-05-01 18:19:00,661,Thanks guys!
578279,muskymatt,2011-05-01 20:08:00,2608,"Make sure it's stamped marine plywood, mine has 13 layers per 3/4"", it's heavy and very solid"
578285,muskymatt,2011-05-01 20:28:00,2608,"More pics, and I'm getting close to actually start putting it all back together, made some great progress this weekend, next weekend is the re-assembly.      Part of the aluminum transom sandwich (inner wall) was too thin for my liking and was pretty much like swiss cheese, and was even 3pcs instead of one solid one.....it was rebuilt....nice piece of aluminum!    Clean, prime with aluminum primer and then paint    Blue to match the console I rebuilt last year!!    The old one....    Very expensive marine ply...not to be screwed up,,,,measure twice cut once    Clamp, clamp and clamp some more......2 part epoxy to glue together and seal coat the whole new transom    Ready to be installed, nice solid piece of wood....  Next week, the finished product  "
578287,muskymatt,2011-05-01 20:32:00,2608,  Soon Mike.....soon
578313,Handlebarz,2011-05-01 21:24:00,3790,Thanks for walking us through the rebuild again Matt its always nice to watch progress when working on a project like that.
578400,dhickey,2011-05-02 00:44:00,1038, there are 2 sheetstock suplyrers i Bolton that should carry marine ply .reyette and meteor i have used them . another is in bramton Robert Burreys. these companeys are not a shure bet but i do know that they carry it from time to time?call first.  a shure bett is Oliver lumber co.they always have it but they are west of Milton. your best bett is to ask a local marina. i did that when i fixed up my boat. the marina in Lafroy at the end of kilarney beach road pionted me in th right direction.(invaluable advice)  any questions dont hesitate to pm me. saltydawg
