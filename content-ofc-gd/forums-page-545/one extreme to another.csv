This year i'm getting the barrels ready to keep the dock from floating away.Its happened before lol thats how my sister ended up with a new dock.. well i'm glade to see the water up and that i wont have to rebuild my prop to many times this year. I can't wait for the g2g this year had a blast last year and plan on going this year and since there is water it could be even more enjoyable out there
