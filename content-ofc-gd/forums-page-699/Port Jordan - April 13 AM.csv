That test also went well, so we are all ready for the upcoming boat season Both had plenty of laughs, play, sleep and everything else in between...even managed to lose couple fish at the net ha ha ha Oh well there were plenty for loosing and keeping few... From 9:30am until 10:30 was the best bite...then is slowed a bit with the wind changing to NE...we hardly went deeper than 20 fow...body baits on flat line and leadcore did the damage...had one rigger down but there was nobody there  As I said we've lost few fish at my new  (HUGE) net...it was too heavy for Jordan to hold...let few more go...and kept few for my new smoker.... Here are few shots from the day....        Jordan got tired after holding this one for the picture so we skipped the rest of the photos Both kids are asking me when is the next time....so I am sure it must have been good day for them as well   Cheers, Ice Fisherman"
