454638,Jer,2010-04-11 14:05:00,1426,"What is the limit for panfish in the rest of Ontario? Why? Because the rest of Ontario has a 50 sunfish limit. The Kawarthas are already getting the benefit of the doubt at 300. Why is this not enough?  What is the difference between a Bluegill, Pumkinseed and a Sunfish? http://www.ibnature.com/Redear,Bluegill%20Sunfish.pdf Pumpkinseed and sunfish are the same fish. Bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus) Redear Sunfish (Lepomis microlophus) What you seem to be missing , Jodi, is that they are all sunfish.  A bluegill has more meat and is less bony. If you hold a bluegill and sunfish of the same size you can feel the extra meat along the back bone of the bluegill. I'll agree that a bluegill tends to be meatier than a pumkinseed, but what's your point?   Why is Rice Lake not as safe as other lakes? Does the Trent Severn Waterway only travel through Rice Lake, bypassing all the other lakes between Lake Simcoe and Lake Ontario? Are you serious? Is Rice Lake the only lake that is shallow on the TSW? I don't know. I'm sure you do. My concern is Rice Lake. Others can worry about lakes they understand much better than I. Could you point out where all these springs are? I know of two right in the bay in front of our resort. We mark them on the rare times we can skate on the lake. There is also a huge pressure crack that comes up without warning. I know of one truck that got stuck on it this winter. He called 911.  I would hazard a guess that Upper Buckhorn is much more dangerous in most areas than Rice. I haven't heard any outcry from our local emergency services. Ice fishing can be inherently dangerous at times. It's no different on Rice than anywhere else in Ontario."
454646,Sinker,2010-04-11 14:23:00,8692,"Anytime your on the water, or ice, can be dangerouse. Rice lake is no more dangerous than any other body of water. I don't get that point at all. Actually, I don't get a lot of this whole thread.  I've lost track of RLTA's point, and I'm not going back to read it all again.  Lets just all pretend the limit on rice lake for sunfish is 500, we'll tell that to all the americans, and see how many more show up. I really find it hard to believe the RLTA think its the fish limits that are keeping american anglers out of thier resorts. Are you really THAT daft?  Also, I can't, for the life of me, figure out why you don't find a new target group for your resorts??? Rice lake is a great fishery. I fish it all year round, many, many days a season. I'm sure there are many, many more anglers who would LOVE the opportunities that I have, fishing rice lake. Put your thinking caps on, and target them! Get them in your resorts, put them on fish, have a great season...........your wasting your time with this one. Get over it and move onto new things.    S."
454697,swishmick,2010-04-11 16:44:00,8,"It's extremely doubtful that there's anything to worry about with respect to the state of Rice Lake's sunfish stocks when the OMNR is implementing an all year open season, engaging local government to improve access to the resource, promoting the fishery and harvest opportunities, and actively pursuing angler recruitment and education.  You could say that this is OMNR-style plundering of a resource.  It's taking something that the RLTA had to themselves for a while and trying to super-size it.  Of course, they've stepped on a few toes so far.  A temporary bump up to 500 for a couple years to ease the transition of existing businesses would be a kind gesture, especially as their (the OMNR) plan is all about  selling the panfish resource on a much bigger scale than the RLTA ever had going, albeit to many more anglers than a few Americans.  The RLTA should benefit from these plans, though it appears unlikely as, assuming that their fish limit focused points are made in good faith  and why wouldn't they be, really  most of their businesses seem narrowly catered to those who fish in the summer for part of a food budget.  No insulation/winterizing to take advantage of the ice fishing season?  looks like these guys are just scraping by, and the area really needs some economic development.  It's too bad the way this thing has panned out with the RLTA's image taking a beating over something that both sides are guilty of: trying to increase the exploitation of sunfish."
454710,chessy,2010-04-11 18:16:00,610,now that these rules are implemented here are a few questions the 30 fish over the length limit must be kept whole correct???  and how much space would 300 sunfish be when laid out in propor packaging ..
454833,Rice Lake resident,2010-04-12 00:53:00,6,"The shipping regulations have not changed.  The species must be recognizable which means they must have skin on them.  300 filetted and frozen bluegill fit in a small cooler and weigh approx 20lb.  The RLTA did have a trophy for largest bluegill for years.  We haven't had one for 4 years as we were encouraging people to throw the big ones back.  I'm sure we'll be bringing back the trophy.  Looks like now we'll be getting rid of the walleye trophy as you can't keep any big ones.  Most of them were kept in live wells and successfully released anyway but we're not encouraging anyone to bring a large walleye off the lake for a photo when regulations say you can't keep them.  All sunfish, bluegill are bass as well.  I'm not sure what the point is anymore either.  Happy fishing!"
454835,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-04-12 01:00:00,0," Released or not, putting an OOS or out of the legal sized fish in your live well counts as possession, and is thus, also illegal to do so.  Any illegal fish must be released immediately."
454842,bucktail,2010-04-12 01:11:00,1857,I can't believe that a nearly unlimited catch and keep proposal has even entered anyones mind in thhis day and age!

454929,bigfish1965,2010-04-12 06:36:00,3382," 300 sunfish when fileted weigh 20 pounds?? What are you using to filet with, a chain saw?? According to TakeMeFishing.org the average pumpkinseed weighs 1 pound. Assume a waste of 75% and you get 4 ounces per fish of filet. 4 ounces X 300 fish=1,200 ounces/16 oz per pound= 75 pounds   Putting a fish that is out of the slot into your livewell is illegal. I would hope you do more than 'not encourage' this."
454960,Rice Lake resident,2010-04-12 12:15:00,6,"The average bluegill out of Rice Lake weighs more like 8 or 9 ounces.  A one pound sunfish would certainly be longer than 7"" and they can only take 30 of those on a sport licence. 50 per day would be a much more fair limit for sunfish than a 300 possession limit.  An angler who visits for two weeks could then take home 750 fish.  You're right.  Rice Lake doesn't have redear sunfish which is yet ANOTHER different breed of the cichlyd family of bass. I had no idea there were so many different kinds. They're even related to the cichlyds you might keep in an aquarium. Rice Lake does have the pumpkinseed which is the native fish and the bluegill which is the invasive species, still two different fish."
454972,Roy,2010-04-12 12:40:00,13728,"I have no idea where this stuff is coming from but here it is....    Rice Lake Tourist Association  February 10, 2010  County of Peterborough  470 Water Street  Peterborough, Ontario  K9H 3M3    Dear Warden Jones and Members of Council,  Although we have concerns, the Rice Lake Tourist Association does conditionally support the decision of the MNR to introduce ice fishing on Rice Lake. The RLTA strongly encourages the MNR and the OPP to maintain constant monitoring on Rice Lake to ensure adherence to the regulations.  The RLTA disagrees with the MNR on the introduction of sunfish limits on Rice Lake. At no time during the deliberations by the FMZ 17 Advisory Council was it suggested by MNR or anyone else that the sustainability of the sunfish population on Rice Lake required the imposition of limits. MNR's own data shows that the average size of sunfish on Rice Lake actually improved on the last creel survey. We are very concerned with limits being imposed to satisfy social concerns rather than biology.  Creel surveys are typically done every 4 years by the MNR and RLTa has asked them to increase the frequency to an annual survey so that changes in the fishery will be noted sooner, rather than later.  The imposition of sunfish limits has negatively impacted businesses on and around Rice Lake with many resorts receiving cancellations for the upcoming season.  Please direct your questions or concerns to me.  Sincerely    Maureen Brough  President, Rice Lake Tourist Association  705-939-6761  [email protected]  www.ricelakecanada.com"
454982,Michael_Brown,2010-04-12 13:09:00,411,"You see this is what we want. The RLTA has supported ice fishing all along, just a few members who claimed they represented the RLTA, were opposed to ice fishing. As for the panfish limits they have always stated that they oppose them. I have no problem with this. I disagree with them but they are allowed their opinion. The topic can be debated for a long time but the fact is the new regulation is the 300/30 limit which has been discussed at length. Everyone understands that sunfish are not endanger of disappeaing from Rice lake, however the size structure of the fish is a concern. RLTA members have had a voluntary program to release larger sunfish, I see no reason for this program to stop. Just because they can harvest 30 over 7.1 inches and 300 total, doesn't mean we need to encourage the behaviour. Rice Lake is a great multi-species lake, sell it for the experience not the harvest ability.  I spoke with a resort owner from northern ontario recently, guess what their business was down 60% last season. 95% of their clients are american. He is hoping the strong canadian dollar, gas prices, border security issues and weak american economy improve because his regular clients want to come back to enjoy canadian fishing, it is just tough to find the extra cash right now for a fishing trip. He expects business to improve this year. They strongly support live release at their resort with only a couple fish being harvested each day for shore lunch."
455043,chessy,2010-04-12 16:00:00,610,"Township supports request for new fishing regs  RICE LAKE: Tourist association seeks special designation  Posted By VALERIE MACDONALD NORTHUMBERLAND TODAY  Posted 2 hours ago Township councillors have unanimously endorsed a request from the Rice Lake Tourist Association to ask the natural resources ministry to specially designate the waterway with detailed regulations related to fishing.  The regulations are to be created through a ""comprehensive public consultation process"" including all of the stakeholders and abutting municipalities in Northumberland and Peterborough, according to the motion adopted at council's meeting last week.    The tourist association made presentations to council and asked that council petition the ministry for a reversal to year-round fishing, and to increase the panfish limited to 500 from 300, but these specifics were not addressed in the motion.  Northumberland County councillors, including Hamilton Township Mayor Mark Lovshin, have already endorsed a similar motion.  As part of the next step, the township has invited and is expecting a Ministry of Natural Resources delegation to attend the next council meeting on Tuesday, April 13 at which more specifics will be discussed. vmacdonald@northumber landtoday.

As much as I appreciate the American tourists visiting our great country, I don't believe that natural resource decisions should be made based on whether they will continue to visit ""Rice Lake"" if there are limits on panfish.  Florida implemented salt water licences 2 years ago and I didn't have a say into whether this should happen or not.  Did I stop going? No. Is Rice Lake the centre of the Universe or what? Maybe the resort owners should sell if they can't make a go of it."
455725,Ron,2010-04-14 03:10:00,1683,"Well, I think we can finally put this thread to rest.  I went to the Hamilton Township council meeting tonight. Dan Taillon and Tammy Tellier of the OMNR were there to give a presentation to the council. Apparently, a lot of questions were answered in regards to the new regulations which have taken effect Jan 1. The council were surprised that the RLTA did support the year round fishing season on Panfish. I am quite certain that the council now understands it is not practical to create Rice Lake a Special Designated Waterway, as there is nothing special about Rice Lake. Rice Lake is an average lake within the zone. It is not the deepest lake on the system, it is not the shallowest lake on the system. Rice Lake used to have a great abundance on Bluegill in the 10 inch range back in the early 80's, actually considered non existent now. Rice Lake used to have a great abundance of Bluegill in the 9 inch range back in the late 80's, these are considered a rarity in this day and age. A trophy Bluegill in Rice Lake is now considered to be 8 inches, Can you believe it? It only took 20 yrs to drastically reduce the size of a Bluegill by 2 inches. To say the average Bluegill has increased in size which is supported by the OMNR data, the increase merely an 1/8 of an inch. Hopefully in 20 yrs time we can get the size of the Bluegill back to the 10 inch mark. Highly unlikely though.  I am glad Dan went through everything making the deciding factors of the regulations. This certainly answered many questions for the council.  I am more than disappointed in the RLTA with ony 2 members showing up. The vocal ones of the Association, didn't have the gonads to attend this meeting. The council soon discovered that RLTA did vote for icefishing and it was misrepresentation, deception if you will, by the spokesperson representing RLTA.  If their key interest was for the concern of Rice Lake, I am certain they would have been there, I know I was. The council members had many valid questions of which in my opinion, were addressed and professionally answered, even the concerns with the Walleye population and Carp die off!  I am looking forward to Valerie MacDonald's, news paper article on this one.  Cudos to you Dan Taillon, very well represented for what the advisory council had covered for over 3 years and also the Biological framework to back the new regulations.  If people want the rest of the story, send me a PM and I will be glad to write it all up for you.  Cheers, Ron Reyns (Ron Reyns Maintenance 905 372-0512)"

454291,bigfish1965,2010-04-10 15:25:00,3382,"Well, apparently I am not a 'real' fisherman... my feelings are hurt. I think the fact that the majority of Ontario anglers are against your proposal would give you pause. But it appears that is not the case. Comparing one moose to 300 fish is a fairly poor straw man argument. Fallacious reasoning is never a good idea. There is so much fence sitting being used by the group... A- We are worried that year round fishing will harm the fishery B- We thing that a 300 fish limit is too low. C- We are worried what will happen if the fish don't all get eaten...  It is clear you knowledge of biology is rather limited. What happens to high populations of prey? It increases predator populations and decreases prey individual size until balance is reached then it goes back. It has been that way since the dawn of life on this planet. The difference between us and other predators is that we have freezers.  Why don't you stick to the argument that is true and can be worked on... ""We believe the new limits are a contributing factor to a decline in reservations and occupancy. Since socio-economics must be considered in limit studies, we would ask the MNR to keep this in mind when the next set of regulations come out. In the mean time, we will aggressively market the Rice Lake area as not only a fishing destination, but as a family recreation area as well and ask for Tourism Ontario's help in this transition.""  Your initial tactic failed..and yet it continues to be modified, even to the point it is contrary to the initial argument, and no one has stopped to say..THIS IS WORKING!

We are concerned with the overall health of the fishery...nothing else. No extra agendas to be reconciled. I have far more trust with the MNR on this issue. The same argument was made when walleye limits were cut and yet, the sky didn't fall and fishing related tourism felt the same changes as other tourism. Your business changes are due to a poor US economy and a lack of adaptation on your part, no other reason. If you spent half as much time working on promotion and altering your business plan as you do making this futile argument, you may have already made up for the changes."

What is the limit for panfish in the rest of Ontario?  What is the difference between a Bluegill, Pumkinseed and a Sunfish?  Why are people throwing the Sunfish back, are they too small?  When the RLTA voluntarily staked out the spawning areas, did anyone fish these spawning areas?  Has poaching only been a problem since the new fishing regulatoins?  If Bluegill are ""stabilized"" in Rice Lake, how is the size base holding? If it has increased in size, by how much? If it has decreased in size, by how much? Let's take this over a 5 year term.  Is it only pickerel (walleye) that are subject to undue stress and are likely to die?  Would this happen to Bluegill, Perch, Muskie as well? Would this be applicable all year round or only during the winter months?  Why is Icefishing pointless for Bluegill?  Why is Rice Lake not as safe as other lakes?  Does the Trent Severn Waterway only travel through Rice Lake, bypassing all the other lakes between Lake Simcoe and Lake Ontario?  Is Rice Lake the only lake that is shallow on the TSW?  Could you point out where all these springs are?   I look forward to your answers.  Regards,  Ron Reyns"

Majority of the time an individual, though you can apply, will not receive a tag.  Your turn.  Still, I don't understand what this has to do with the Panfish limits......  Cheers, Ron..."
454064,Jer,2010-04-09 23:49:00,1426,"How you can even compare the two, I have no idea.  Moose hunting is one of the most regulated and controlled forms of outdoor activity we have in this province. There are only so many tags available for each designated area. What you are proposing is a continued free-for-all on Kawartha panfish.  If you would truely prefer the moose tag scenario for panfish, perhaps your resort, and all others, including the casual fisherman, should be allotted a quota of panfish for the year. If your guests catch there 2000 fish by July 15, make sure they tag each and every one of them, close up and go to Florida early."

I think that would be more valid.  Your analogy makes me see that if I were comparing taking a Moose to catching my limit of Bluegill and if I went hunting Moose in FMZ 17, it would be equivalent to me being allowed 6 times the amount I am anywhere else, which is the case currently for angling opportunities.  Does it seem fair now?  JP"
454233,Billy Bob,2010-04-10 12:25:00,5865,One last thing to think about and compare......  Rice Lake is a SMALL inland lake that the cottage owners don't want to allow ice fishing because of so called safety reasons but they want the limit raised from 300 to 500 fish or unlimited amounts of bluegills.  Lake Erie is a HUGE lake that allows ice fishing and has a 50 fish limit on perch......
454242,Rice Lake resident,2010-04-10 13:05:00,6," I have not posted before as I have no desire to get into pointless arguements but this one is just funny.  How can an ""all knowing angler"" not know the difference between bluegill and sunfish?  They are very similar but since you have quite a few opinions on the subject you really should understand the facts.  ""Differences between bluegill and redear arise when comparing the habitat and feeding requirements of the two. First of all, Redear sunfish are very structure oriented, unlike their Bluegill counterparts who will frequent open waters. Like bluegill, redear sunfish consume small aquatic insects. However, snails and other mollusks comprise a large portion of the Redear’s diet. Although both species will inhabit sand and gravel beach areas during their spawning season, Redear sunfish usually reproduce only once per season, reducing the time they will be in the beach area""  The rest of this article can be found at http://www.ibnature.com/Redear,Bluegill%20Sunfish.pdf.  There are a couple of pictures to make it easier for you to understand.  Americans prefer bluegill (the invasive species) as it has more meat and is less bony than the indigenous sunfish.  Go ahead and check my ip address.  I am Jodi from Alpine Resort.  If you'd like to see the difference come on over any time in June and some of our REAL fishermen will show you the difference and might even give you some tips on cleaning fish so there is no waste."
454250,Jer,2010-04-10 13:28:00,1426,"I think Ron was making the point that bluegill are sunfish, just like pumpkinseed and redear.  The regs don't differentiate, the 300 limit is for all sunfish combined."
454252,Jer,2010-04-10 13:32:00,1426,"  I thought no one was coming this year...  But if they do, I'm glad that they clean fish so efficiently, at least they will get the most out of their 300 limit."
454273,chessy,2010-04-10 14:33:00,610,"Wow Rice Lake resident, instead of coping  and pasting maybe you should know the phenomenology first. Sunfish are a family name and in this name ,there are a few sub species, which include largemouth bass pumpkin seed and blue gill and many more  so before you go pasting other information. Make sure you get it all right. If you were to have said that there is a different between bluegills and redears or bluegills and pumpkinseeds that would be correct. But a deferment between sunfish and bluegill is completely wrong.  Just like your statement about come over and see some REAL fishermen in the summer Your statement should have been come over and PAY ME MONEY AND I WILL INCLUDE  YOU IN THE ""FAMILY"" OF REAL FISHERMEN  "
454278,Michael_Brown,2010-04-10 14:43:00,411,"The petition posted by the RLTA does not allow you to view the signatures or the comments posted. Could one of you please change that so we may have a honest comparison of the two. I would like to point out to everyone that Mike Ferguson(aka Mayor of Rice) has signed the anglers petition.  Ron you should be ashamed, for not stating the difference between bluegill/pumkinseed and the less common redear sunfish.  Also the moose/sunfish thing is completely stupid. Should we allow anglers to harvest a thousand pounds of Rice Lake walleye? Unless you find a 1000 pound sunfish, then it should be larger than your hand so you can voluntarily release it. Maybe we could open the sunfish season on Rice for only a couple of weeks in the fall. That might work, I know it would be great help for a stressed fishery.  Go ahead cottage owners, (I don't believe you people actually speak for the majority of the RLTA) keep annoying, fighting with and giving all your customers(anglers and friends)a reason to not attend your place of business. If only you had embraced the new opportunities presented to you and spent your time and energy realizing the new potential of an extended business season and healthy fishery resource.  My relatives have rented most of cottage resort for a family/fishing reunion this summer. Spending thousands of dollars locally,    to enjoy a weekend together having fun and fishing with each other and the kids. I'm fairly sure we are not the only family that does this.   Michael Brown"
454279,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-04-10 14:45:00,0," Red ear sunfish (Lepomis microlophus) are indigenous to the southern united states.  Why are they your basis for comparison with ""indigenous"" species?  Species of the genus ""Lepomis"" that are native to Canada are Lepomis macrochirus (bluegill), Lepomis gibbosus (pumpkinseed), Lepomis megalotis (longear sunfish), Lepomis cyanellus (green sunfish), and Lepomis auritus (redbreast sunfish) which is only native to Newfoundland.  Perhaps before spreading misinformation to the public you should ensure your audience don't know more about fisheries than you do."
454280,Rice Lake resident,2010-04-10 14:46:00,6," The regs don't differentiate but the MNR's study DOES.  They are a different fish and if you can't tell the difference I invite you to come on down and one of our US anglers will point out the differences to you.  Pumpkinseed, redear and sunfish are different names for the same fish.  The study states that bluegill numbers have stabilized.  This is despite agressive fishing for 30+ years so with the decreasing numbers of US visitors decreasing over the last few years that should be more than enough for these numbers to INCREASE which may not be good.  Our concern is what will happen to other fisheries if they are allowed to flourish practically unhindered. I never said NO one is coming but we have had several cancellations.  That in itself would not bother us if these limits were biologically warranted as we DO care about the future of the Rice Lake fishery.  Please try to be open minded and try to see that there may be a different perspective than the one you see.  Our guests have been throwing large males back.  With these new regs they will keep them as they're limited to numbers.  You can't blame them.  If they can only keep 300 fish after a 2 week vacation they might as well make it worthwhile. Most resort owners are fishing licence issuers and take this responsiblity seriously.  We have often educated our guests on the dangers of ""accidently"" catching bass when not yet in season, even if they throw them back, yet we've seen plenty of ""locals"" obviously fishing for bass out of season.  We've worked with the MNR to try to increase the size of bluegill.  We ask our guests to voluntarily through large pickerel back as they are the breeders.  We are not objecting to any of the regs other than the bluegill. We care about the lake."
454281,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-04-10 14:52:00,0,"  Check your facts.  I posted the scientific names for the species above.  You can call them all the same thing if you want, but they are unique species.  Perhaps your American customers aren't as good at fish ID as you would think.

County opposes Rice Lake fishing designation   Peterborough County won't ask the Ministry of Natural Resources to create a special designation with specific regulations for Rice Lake, county council decided on Wednesday. The county has heard from the Rice Lake Tourist Association about the new fishing regulations that the province implemented earlier this year. The resort operators association argued for higher limits on the number of panfish that can be caught.  Council decided against supporting a Northumberland County council resolution to ask the Ministry of Natural Resources to create a special designation for Rice Lake. Local businesses that depend on recreational fishing are fully supportive of the new regulations, such as the daily limit of 300 sunfish of which 30 can be seven inches or longer for anglers with a sport fishing licence, said Terry Quinney, the Ontario Federation of Anglers and Hunters fish and wildlife services manager.  ""We're fully supportive of these conservation regulations,"" he told council. ""If they're managed wisely, we can enjoy the benefits in perpetuity.""  Douro-Dummer Deputy Reeve Karl Moher asked Quinney if there should have been more education or consultation with local associations about safety issues with the introduction of ice fishing for the Kawartha Lakes.  ""That's a concern to our EMS people and our fire department that have to rescue these people when they get into trouble,"" he said.  The Ontario Federation of Anglers and Hunters would be the first to want to participate in any educational campaign with the county or the Ministry of Natural Resources, Quinney said.  ""Safety on the water is paramount,"" he said.  The Ontario Federation of Anglers and Hunters doesn't support the idea to create a special designation for Rice Lake, Quinney said.  ""The Ontario Federation of Anglers and Hunters agrees that Rice Lake is special.... The socioeconomic value of Rice Lake speaks for itself.... But we also want to promote every other lake in the Kawarthas,"" he said.     "

Let me set the chain of logic here for reasonably intelligent people. The MNR decides that opening FMZ17 to fishing all year is not a bad idea. THEN they figure since we are fishing them all year, let's look at which fish need added protection due to added pressure. They then decide that the other seasons and limits are good enough, except we should protect the sunfish a bit cause people will be after them all year instead of 7 months of the year. The sunfish biomass is figured, a reasonable harvest is determined, creel censuses are referred to for likely catch and retain and the number 300 comes about. She then says they are a garbage fish...hardly worth the effort. Yet this entire rally has been put into place and a few KB of our database filled with this absolute stupidity. I wish I lived up there right now... Ms. Irving...I know you are reading this..or having someone read it to you, but I challenge you to a debate.

448511,Billy Bob,2010-03-26 21:28:00,5865,I am a American Angler and I will not book a reservation at Rice Lake because the limit is too HIGH...I have concerns that the fish population is/could suffer even with this 300 limit on pan fish....I and my family can only eat so much fish.
448586,GregF2,2010-03-27 00:28:00,46,"I disagree with her point of raising the limits on panfish - keep them where they are at or even lower the bluegill limit.  But, I totally agree with her on ice fishing.  Totally contradictory, but have made this point before and know most people don't agree with it."
448612,Ron,2010-03-27 01:24:00,1683,"  I don't understand why you would have a point like that Greg. The ice fishing harvest, although I have not seen the numbers yet. I would be surprised there were more than 500 Sunfish in total harvested. 500 Sunfish being the number all anglers in total harvested through the ice on Rice Lake. Personally I did not harvest one Sunfish, however I did harvest 75 Perch in total. 50 of those Perch were used to prove a point. Too bad the RLTA doesn't look at this in a positive way to promote icefishing. The size of Perch we were catching are very comparable to the size we catch on Lake Simcoe. Speaking with the local CO who frequented Rice Lake often, said there were not many people who harvested fish. On a good note, he only laid one charge in relation to keeping fish out of season. Fortunately for the person who got charged, the fish swam away. The OPP laid several charges for drinking but that is still lower than the amount of drinking related charges in the Summer months.  I for one am not targeting Sunfish through the ice, they are not as agressive during the winter months. I did however find an area where they are holding but the size of them are way too small - 15cm (6 inches) was the biggest one I caught. I mostly target Crappies in the winter months and use to travel many kms (miles) to pursue them. Doing over night trips and weekend trips North of Orillia was not uncommon for me last year. Now I can do this in my back yard. Once people find the Crappies on Rice Lake, that will be the main targeted species through the ice.  *Edit*  Furthermore, With all of the Kawartha Lakes being open, the fishing pressure laxed off on other lakes like Scugog. It was also noted that the fishing pressure slowed down on the Haliburtan Lakes for the Lake Trout as well. The anglers did not all just go to Rice Lake to ice fish, they spread out on all of the Kawartha lakes. Rice Lake for an example only received perhaps 250 - 500 anglers at most. There was only 1 area which was concentrated with anglers - Bewdley. (easy access and BJ Tackle had hut rentals). All the other areas that I visited may have had 2 or 3 huts here and there. Gores Landing for an example, had 5 huts at one point. Without giving away the areas I fished, in total I had 8 huts in the same areas I was fishing. The 3 most heavily fished Lakes on the Kawarthas this winter were Chemung, Sturgeon and Big Bald.  The best part of ice fishing was seeing all the kids out there having fun with their friends and families. That to me is much better than having the kids couped up indoors playing Nintendo, watching TV.  Cheers, Ron..."

453549,cheaptackle,2010-04-08 15:04:00,849," Kudos to the County, OFAH and all others who have spoken against the special designation.  I believe it was best summed up by the statement regarding the potential for each Kawartha Lake to seek such designation should RLTA be successful. At last, some sanity has surfaced to decry the efforts of a few short sighted and self interested alleged spokespersons. As much as I now hope this issue will be put to bed, I'm unfortunately faced with considering the reality of the ""whiners"" attempting yet another avenue to pursue their beliefs.  I sincerely hope they finally give up the effort to change what has already been decided, and instead channel their energies into educating themselves BEYOND their own interests and into the greater good.

If they want to designate Rice Lake to have separate regulations, fine. I guess they are saying ""ta Hell with the Associations in the Kawartha Lakes"" So what happens to Bridgenorth tourists who find out that there is a limit on all Lakes except Rice Lake? Where do you think these tourists will book then?  Ok, lets say they go ahead with the 500 limit. I guess with Rice Lake being so fertile, perhaps they should make an exception to the walleye as well. Lets take the limit back to 6 with no size limit. Now lets not forget to decrease the size limit for Muskie back to 36 inches too. Hey, this lake is so fertile, lets have year round fishing for all species! Even better, lets allow netting too!  Now back to reality...  A limit of 300 pan fish, check the rest of the Province, check the rest of North America. Where is the limit any higher than 300? Yes Ice fishing is open now. Did you see anyone who harvested 300 pan fish? Yes I harvested 50 Perch in one day, far from being ethical in my opinion (yes I admit, MY OPINION). Why did I harvest that many? To prove a point. Did they go to waste? Well if you consider pan frying them in butter and feed a family of 6 (my wife, 2 daughters and their boyfriends plus myself) for 4 meals.

If the RLTA thinks they are going to get the regs changed, they for sure have thier heads buried in the sand.  The lake hardly got touched at all by winter anglers this year. There were a few guys out of easy access areas, but at least 90% of the lake was untouched.  I'd be willing to bet there were no fisherman that went thru the ice. Snowmobilers maybe, but fisherman? I have my doubts.  I also bet that a lodge booked with americans fishing panfish for the week, would harvest more fish in that week, than were harvested all winter out of the lake.  The RLTA argument is so weak, I'd be embarrassed to even tell the MNR about it.  Do the members of the RLTA realize the damage thier doing with this whole thing??

Why should one group of people who are upset with the changes to their lake have so much say in what others have worked so hard for over 3 years? Everyone involved with this decision supported it origionaly (including the RLTA) The fire department in the area has already purchased a rescue vehicle of some sort, this would have been in last years budget, before the change in regulations.

I would like to point out that we have offered to help work with the RLTA in an effort to increase business. We have no interest in losing any of the tourist operators that serve the lake community. The economy and other issues not related to the fishery, have caused a major downturn in cottage rentals, we understand that. We support tourism and actually enjoy fishing with and meeting anglers from all over North America, the fishery is for everyone to enjoy. That being said it also needs to be protected.  I'm glad you have enjoyed the ice fishing in the Kawartha's with your family. So did I and and thousands of others. The potential for new business oppourtunity is there and very real. Now we just need to celebrate what we have and invite people to come enjoy it. Fighting about who said what on a website this large will not benefit anyone but maybe the RLTA should make an effort to put forth a clear message about what they do support and make that known to the local municipalities or other groups that may have been mislead or confused.

If the RLTA representatives are no better at lobbying than they are at debating in this forum why even worry about them getting their wishes with the govt? Based on what I've seen here they're more likely to get the lake shut down to non-resident fishing altogether or worse. You interested forum members might do better to just worry about collateral damage control rather than arguing with the mayor et al about their position.  And that being said I once hung out with some fellers back in my younger days who run operations on the lake and as memory serves they were way too intelligent to be associated with the half-baked vaudeville act we're experiencing here. So I figure this is either a group of self-appointed loose cannons running amok with an ill-conceived solution to an isolated problem or a splinter cell (from a sanctioned group effort) who confuse bluster and bullying with the nuances of lobbying and negotiation.  To all interested parties good luck with your lake's future. I trust it's actually in better hands than some of those presenting their confused and spurious arguments here.

To be successfull in todays economy these operators need to adapt there business plans, what worked 10yrs ago is not going to work today.Smarten up or go broke, opening the lake for ice fishing has given you the oportunity to change your stratagy and opened up a whole new market. Stop being stupid and sieze the moment and start making some $$$$$$ if you don't adapt then whine and cry and go broke."
446982,Great Lake Steel,2010-03-23 16:39:00,41,"Reading between the lines, here's my 2 cent interpretation of their motivation.  As mentioned in a few articles, the lodges belonging to the three members in question are not winterized ""nor do we want them to be"". So they can't take advantage of the winter ice fishing bookings.  That combined with the lower limits might mean that fishing tourist business on Rice will be more spread out over the year. Which if you average it out might mean less business during their traditional peak period. For obvious reasons, winterized lodges/resorts have a big advantage, not just in the winter business but also through that exposure the 'return' business the following summer.  I think this has zilch to do with concern for the environment and more to do with greed. The rules are better for their competition than for them.... there you have it."
447112,jimmer,2010-03-23 19:59:00,2730,"JF, don't be fooled. I believe that these are the same people that put an end to the Panfish Focus group back in the 90's.  It looked like there were going to be limits put in place back then and then all of a sudden the discussions were over and no panfish limits. The majority of the group was in favour of limits and that group included resort owners from other lakes who were experiencing over harvesting for the first time. The only difference from then to now is this wonderful forum that can rally everyone to express their opinions, rather than a small group in a room at some hotel."

445600,Ron,2010-03-19 21:53:00,1683,"Actually, it doesn't take long to find names of resorts and about people on the internet.  I googled Susan Irving-Cogar and this is what I got:  Rice Lake ice fishing problems feared Brendan Wedley, Peterborough Examiner January 21st, 2010 Allowing ice fishing on Rice Lake and limiting the number of panfish caught from the lake will cause problems, a local tourist association representative says.  Susan Irving-Cogar, the owner of Sunshine Cove Cottage Resort and a Rice Lake Tourist Association member, urged county council Wednesday to complain about the new fishing regulations to the provincial government.  Council plans to raise the issue with newly appointed Natural Resources Minister Linda Jeffrey at the Rural Ontario Municipal Association conference that runs from Feb. 21-24 in Toronto.  A panel put in place three years before the regulation changes to research the fishing situation and make recommendations found there should be a 500-panfish limit, Irving-Cogar said.  “Overbreeding of this invasive species is something that will happen,” she said, “Overbreeding is a serious concern.”  Previously, there wasn’t a limit on the number of panfish a person could catch, Irving-Cogar said.  A panfish is a small fish that generally can fit in a frying pan. Examples of species of panfish include sunfish, crappie and perch.  With the new regulations, the limits are 300 sunfish with only 30 more than 18 centimetres long with a sport licence or 15 sunfish of any size with a conservation licence; 30 crappie with a sport licence or 10 with a conservation licence; 50 perch with a sport licence or 25 with a conservation licence.  The Ministry of Natural Resources brought in various new fishing regulations across the province on Jan. 1.  Among the regulation changes, the fishing season for sunfish, yellow perch, black crappie and northern park has been extended to year-round; the catch limit for walleye between 35 and 50 centimetres is four with a sport licence and one with a conservation licence; and the bass, muskie and walleye season is extended to Dec. 15.  There has been no winter fishery on Rice Lake in more than 90 years, Irving-Cogar said.  “Ice fishing brings a lot of problems with it,” she said.  Irving-Cogar listed problems such as Rice Lake’s reputation for unstable ice, the current in the lake with inflow from the Otonabee River and outflow at Hastings into the Trent River, putting emergency staff at peril if they need to rescue people fishing on the like in the winter, walleye poaching and the lack of conservation officers.  Irving-Cogar asked council to push the Ministry of Natural Resources to create special area for Rice Lake with its own set of regulations.  The bulk of resorts around the lake aren’t winterized, Irving-Cogar said.  “We are seasonal and quite frankly we don’t have funds to make ourselves a year-round business and quite frankly we don’t want to,” she said.  Concerns put forward at a public meeting on the regulation changes fell on deaf ears, Havelock-Belmont- Methuen Reeve Ron Gerow said.  “I share your concerns,” he told Irving-Cogar. “I don’t think that MNR actually listened to anybody.”    Rice Lake: A Specially Designated Waterway  The Rice Lake Tourist Association has won support from the County of Northumberland to declare the Lake a specially-designated waterway.

How ever when people try to mis represent them selves I will speak up if telling the truth makes me a big mouth so be it. I can tell you for a fact our fish presentation was liked and excepted a lot better than yours People really believe your fish were going to be wasted so i guess you should take a good look at trhe littlr picture at the bottom of your little write up Michael Ferguson

I commend you Mike Brown and Ron for having the courage to do this.  I can't speak for everyone, but I KNOW I can speak for real fishermen and fisherwomen that the day I come home with 300 fish for the freezer Armageddon must be very close behind. Is your argument Mayor the fact that there is now a limit where there previously was not one your not selling enough bait anymore???  Or are you simply so hung up on your American dollars you will continue to bash and slander the people trying to keep a great fishery for you, me, and our families, great?  Still to this date in all 12 pages of this report there is not one post urging any of us to come and fish your backyard, to take any initiative to promote your ice fishing season, or the cottages who are providing  these services...  Looks to me like your flailing, and now for me atleast its too late...I will never contribute to your cottage services, bait, boat rental or any other service you may provide strictly on principal alone... There are far too many magnificent lakes and outfitters  in this great province to support. Why would I waste my money on such a small group who's whole argument is based on greed.  I take 4-5 trips a year to numerous locations, accounting for thousands of dollars out of my pocket book alone, not to mention that of my friends and colleagues that I can assure you will not be coming to your community!

They walked into a meeting with a bunch of pails trying to make american harvesters look bad but there efforts back fired on them. General public the only thing they got out of it was fifty fish died and were wasted to make a point, Even though I as well as others know these fish could still be used for consumption. from all the calls and e-mails I recieved from that picture in the paper calls as far away as Oshawa all they cared about were the fish they felt were wasted.I didn't feel it was my place to correct them yous caused the mess.After the picture of the packaged fish appeared which I got credit for but was someone elses Some councilors said that had put things in better precpective.I talked to my friend on this matter the one with the fish he is a resort owner but does not write on this site we came up with a plan that would be a win win plan for all parties involved. all we need is a meeting with the minister which I am working on know I have met with Minister befoe Dave Ramsey when he was in power..

I do not think transporting native species from the U.S. to Canada is a wise idea besides if their is a savings it is minimal once you figure in the death rate of the bait. I also purchase the Sport fisherman license not because I harvest fish but to make sure Canada has the money to keep the ministry funded and the fishing as great as it is for years to come.  I did take the time to reread your posts and you are correct the only one you crawfished on is the ice fishing...The portions other than that were full of rash statements and inflammatory comments that would not be said by someone trying to attract customers.

446708,Ron,2010-03-23 01:13:00,1683,"Unfortunately, I think this thread is going to come to an end. Too bad, I thought it was going rather well.  Mike if you have accusations against me, please bring them forward. I would love to see your evidence. Be careful though, slander is an indictable offence. Your efforts on making people think I am a poacher, over harvesting, spoilage of game fish and cheating for a profit in a derby does not reflect very well with my peers.  To Rice Lake Tourist Association,  From what I gather and summed up on this thread is this, and I feel other members in this angling community would agree:  The Rice Lake Tourist Association is against the extended angling opportunities.  The Rice Lake Tourist Association is against the catch limit of 300 panfish of which 30 may be larger than 18cm (7.1) and feel that a 500 limit of which 0 (zero) may be greater than 18cm (7.1) would be better.  Your representatives are accusing all local anglers for contributing 0(zero) dollars into the local economy, you are accusing anyone who is fishing on the ice are poachers.  With the regulations you are proposing you are going to make every ""new to fishing"" fisher person, a poacher. Think back to when you were a kid, what was the first fish you caught? Chances are, if you are with the majority of people, it was a Sunfish.  For your information, when I referred to catch limits, I was not misleading anyone. The following text is copied out of the fishing regulations:  Catch and Possession Limits  The catch limit is the number of fish you are allowed to catch and keep in one day and includes fish that are retained for any period of time and any fish eaten or given away. The possession limit is the number you are allowed to have in your possession on hand, in cold storage, in transit, or anywhere. Possession limits are the same as one day's catch limit except where otherwise specified. "
446709,Michael_Brown,2010-03-23 01:14:00,411,"All right Mr. Ferguson. You win. I give up. We will go with ""your"" new position. Lets leave ice fishing open for everyone to enjoy and lets have a sunfish limit that supports tourism and a healthly fish population. Since your not sure about a number, how about 300 of which only 30 can be larger than 7.1 inches to protect the large males that are important to the fishery.  I figure I should join with you on this issue because when I stood up to represent my support of the absurd idea of leaving ice fishing open and a sunfish limit of 300/30, I and the other concerned anglers in attendance were called anti-american racists who should have white sheets and pointy hats.  I'm not sure what you didn't like about the photo in the paper. Maybe the fact that it represented the truth. That was exactly 50 legal caught perch from Rice lake that overflowed one pail. The remaining pails represented the additional 330 panfish that could be kept as part of one anglers limit.  So now that we are on the same side. What size sheet do you take?  I just wish that Susan Irving Coger had spent 1/10 of her time promoting her business instead of misrepresenting the RLTA at every meeting and media outlet that would listen to her. She wouldn't have time to complain because she would be serving customers.   Spring is here and the panfish are starting to show up in the warm shallows. Grab a kid and a rod and get out fishing. Not sure where to go? Try Rice Lake if you can find a dock or a friendly cottage owner that will let you fish."

444790,crappieperchhunter,2010-03-17 22:19:00,2582, They lived on Simcoe for over ten years and can tell that frozen perch in a bucket came from there just by looking at them   That is the absolute biggest line of crap I think I have ever heard. I've fished perch pretty much everywhere in this province. And they all look the same.  There is no difference whatsover in a Simcoe or Kawartha perch.  If I knew who spouted that line of crap I'd absolutely never EVER believe another word that ever came out of there mouth from that point on.
444792,tightline,2010-03-17 22:29:00,322,"Seems to me that I only count 6 baggies there (maybe 8 not sure) so on average those bags have 15 fish each in them???...looks like the RLTA are throwing out the hail marry play...self serving group...I think so...stop an opportunity to rent out there cottages year round which in Ontario is a significant number of months..well not lately I guess, in order to save a depleting bluegill population, but put no limit on the fishery .... hmmmmmmm...maybe the Yanks don't dig the snow...but hey forget all about the 11,410,046 Ontario residence that just may want to drop a line in OUR  ""backyard""  Am I confused or is this a no brainer??????????"

444810,Roy,2010-03-17 23:08:00,13728,"Well, perhaps it's time to give Rice Lake the same fishing quota advantages as everyone else in the Province and cut the gill possession limit to 50. We'll see how this one plays out. Maybe we'll see things work out for the good of the fishery or maybe we'll see the ""mayor of Rice Lake"" (population32) win to protect his part time job as dock hand at one of the many affluent Rice Lake tourist association members' businesses. Anyhow.....whatever happens, I have to get going...need to line up the eyeholes in my sheets."
444817,Ron,2010-03-17 23:20:00,1683,"  Well well well,  They are acusing me of catching Perch in Lake Simcoe to show as Perch caught on Rice Lake. Funny, I guess we should ask the area Conservatoin Officer as he checked me for my licence and also commented on the size of the Perch I was catching. Curious, I'd like to know how to tell the difference between Simcoe Perch and Rice Lake Perch....  Another comment in regards to Icefishermen putting the local Fire Departments at danger. If it wasn't for myself and another fellow angler, there would have been 2 more snowmobile deaths on Rice Lake. We were fishing near Pengally Point just along side a pressure crack when 2 snowmobilers tried to cross the crack. The first guy made it but 2nd guy didn't. The first guy went back to rescue his buddy and fell through himself. With Jay and myself and quick thinking, we managed to rescue them out of the ice and also managed to salvage his snowmobile. I guess we should have taken pictures of them almost drowning before we took on the initiative to get them to safety first.  Garbage??? What garbage? Did anyone out there see garbage on the ice? The only article I saw out there was a grocery bag which blew away from a permenant hut.  The unfortunate part of this whole ordeal is we went through all this with the advisory council. 3 years of consulting with differnt stake holders. I guess the past president of the RLTA did n't pass on the info to their members as we are going through all of this again!  ENOUGH IS ENOUGH! Rice Lake Tourists Association, go find another sand box to do your cat scratching in. You were represented at the meetings. Same as the Buckhorn District also City of Kawartha Lakes. RLTA are the only ones who think this is unjustified and are blaming the poor bookings."
444818,Roy,2010-03-17 23:27:00,13728," Simple Ron, Rice Lake perch are smaller and have an RLTA stamp on them...usually near the anal vent."

444879,aplumma,2010-03-18 01:58:00,6896,O.K. I am really peeoood I should have been in bed at 8:30 and here it is 9:57 and I am finally at the end of this brilliant soap opera. I want to nominate NANNA for an Oscar. The Mayor is my second choice. A special thanks to Roy for allowing us to keep track of the players with the I.P. cheat sheet.  I will help the Rice Lake Tourism group.... I am here in Virginia USA and you have not advertised effectively to the point of getting my attention until you came here on OFC. The shame of it is you failed in your attempt to promote tourism in a positive light for the Rice Lake area. I have been coming up North and drive 14 hours to get to a catch and release resort (Nipissing) for the last 5 years. It is a shame that you all did not heed the advice earlier of promoting yourself here at OFC instead of putting on the Soap Opera.  In closing I come to Canada for the people first and the fishing second. If you are a lodge owner a guest that sees you as a friend will return year after year even if they don't get to keep 500 fish.... sell yourselves first we are always watching you at camp and in the news.

444887,Tom McCutcheon,2010-03-18 02:35:00,627," geeze I love that sense of humor.  I Live in the City of Kawartha Lakes, on Pigeon lake and I have already notified my council of the RLTA shennanigans.  Tom."
444890,Michael_Brown,2010-03-18 02:50:00,411,"This is crap.  I have stayed out of this for a while in an effort to let it settle down. I realized the damage it was doing to the image of the RLTA. They do have some very upstanding members and fine resorts but this type of publicity is not good. I will however not lay down to the public ranting of a few.  For the record:  The perch came from Rice Lake, they were frozen to preserve them for later consumption. The RLTA is in favour of ice fishing, they voted for it on the council, their current president is quoted in the paper in support of it. The members causing this ""uproar"" against ice fishing, Susan Irving Cogar, Randy Cogar and Mike Ferguson are speaking on their own behalf but representing themselves as the opinions of the RLTA. The rest of the RLTA by their silence, act as if they accept this but if I was a business on Rice Lk I would be jumping out of the organization as quickly as possible. They have done nothing but shame themselves and damage their image. We have no more or less garbage issues than the rest of the province where all outdoor activities take place. Year-round We had very few incidents of anglers in trouble on the ice and again we are like the rest of the province. When other user groups make up most of the ice rescues, why is ice fishing blamed?  Literally thousands of anglers of all ages enjoyed countless hours and spent tons of money ice fishing in the kawartha's this winter. We had businesses opening up and hiring staff as a result of the new angling oppoutunities. We had non-resident anglers visit the kawartha's to enjoy ice fishing here for the first time. The local business that benefit from angling related income had an increase of 5 1/2 months to the fishing season. We had local derbies and festivals start up that got new anglers out fishing.  I have not dropped to their level of personal attacks and slander, but I'm not sure why. If having an opinion that supports a healthy fishery and increased angling oppourtunities is offensive to them. Good.  Your precious sunfish resource is protected (from you), you have been given the gift of increased business oppourtunities of 5 1/2 months, you have realized an increase in your resale value of your resort due to this increased business oppourtunity, the walleye population is enjoying a nice upswing and you have some of the most researched and public reviewed fishing regulations in the province. Sorry.  If a few mouthy members want to continue this effort to shame themselves and their name in public, then we should give them what they want. Negative press. I can only imagine the joy of staying at their place of business.  It is also time for their members that are seeing the benefits of winter angling to step up. Other groups that are representing anglers need to get involved.  I will be responding to this article in the newspaper. Please join me. I would like to think that more anglers will get involved with this crap from these people.  Mike B"

If they are the ones that are causing the negative press and situation it would seem that by naming their lodges it would be a show of solidarity of the other camps in that they are not the spokesperson for the RLTA. I can say at this point I will avoid the whole Rice Lake fishing just to prevent me from possible booking with the negative RTLA members.  I commend you Mike for taking the time to explain the majority of the  RTLA members true views and hope that time heals for the lodges that do not deserve the negative press.   Art"

440623,Twocoda,2010-03-06 14:00:00,4130, so the solution is to have a unlimited limit????
440632,hirk,2010-03-06 14:43:00,571,"Greg I think you have missed the fact that ice fishing and it's impact on the fishery were taken into account when the studies were done that were used to set new limits,the limits used to be higher on sunfish without the 7"" restriction.The MNR has set limits they feel will protect the fishery and allow for ice fishing at the same time,very progressive thinking on their part,it's good to see they are following the US's lead in setting limits based on the ecosystem in question VS the old province wide blanket regs."
440637,GregF2,2010-03-06 15:10:00,46,"Yes, I do.  I love ice fishing, but my point is why are we are setting limits on panfish - this means the population on Rice Lake is hurting.  Again, I am for the limits, but then we open up ice fishing, which will allow more fish to be taken out of the lake.     If Rice Lake is under so much pressure, then why open up ice fishing, until we monitor what effect the limits have on the fish population.  Then maybe open up the lake for ice fishing.  What is the rush?  Not sure, why is this point so hard to understand?  I was ice fishing on the Canadian side of Lake St Clair a couple weeks ago and talking to a local resident that was saying how he already has 20 pounds of perch in the freezer and was back out for more.  Another one I talked to got his limit in the morning and then came back out in the afternoon and got his limit again.   So, why have limits if they are going to be exploited?  Does ""possession"" mean that you can only keep 50 perch at one time in your freezer, because if so it is being broken a lot and if it does not mean then that it should and somehow being enforced, just like it is if any American would bring fish back home.  This thread has made me so angry now and I am losing the respect of a lot of anglers, who have posted here and that I have respected in the past.  I love going to Rice Lake not just for the fishing, but because I love Canada and Canadians and love the beautiful scenery that it offers.  "
440647,bigfish1965,2010-03-06 15:43:00,3382," You have it a bit backwards, the limits came BECAUSE of the ice fishing. There was no sunfish limits prior to that. It was because of the increase in harvest pressure that the limit was imposed. Without ice fishing there would be no limit, so you couldn't really study the effect. I am sure the MNR will be closely monitoring the lakes over the next few years and making adjustments as needed based on the new harvest pressures. Yes, locals are and always have been the biggest resource violators around. We only hope they get caught... Feel free to call the MNR tips line at  1-877-TIPS-MNR (847-7667)"
440651,Twocoda,2010-03-06 15:54:00,4130, the MNR has imposed a limit ....whats the problem then?   Canadians like to ice fish too why should they have to drive hundreds of miles to enjoy a resource that is readily available in their own backyard?    As i understand it ...there is change in the size of the fish to suggest due dilligence to protect the resource   Did you report to the authorities???? If you did ....good on ya ...if you didnt ....then you really have no right to suggest that whats good for them is also good for you especially if its an illegal event ( just my opinion)   Possession means ....in your pail /freezer/pocket and attached to a stringer or fishing line   No Comment    im sure the feeling is mutual ....there is no limit on the scenery or friendship   When i go to California i abide by the rules imposed by your officials....so really ...im finding it hard to understand where you are comming from
440736,Jer,2010-03-06 23:15:00,1426,"  The fact we enjoy ice-fishing in our own backyard makes you angry? I don't get it, you need to relax and go fishing. I did today, and it was great. We had a beautiful day out on the ice, with virtually no expense. My buddy took home about a dozen nice perch, I hope you don't mind there might be a few less when you come up for your annual trip.  Remember we live here all year long. I find it mildly offensive that you would have such a strong opinion on what I might do with my free time, fully within the law of the land.  Officials finally came to their senses and opened up a huge part of the province to a winter fishery, it's about time! I think nobody could remember anymore why it wasn't allowed in some form or another in the first place.  I've done my part for the local economy as well, having to outfit myself with all the necessary gear to fish regularly on th ice. I've probably spent in excess of $1000 on stuff since Christmas I probably never wouyld have bought otherwise, and guess what? I don't begrudge a penny of it. The winters are long and this has been one of the most enjoyable of my life.  I would say I'm sorry for making you angry, but I'm having too much damn fun!"
440737,462Liquid,2010-03-06 23:19:00,12, LOL! this thread is fairly enjoyable to me....
440751,GregF2,2010-03-07 00:00:00,46,"You find it mildly offensive that I want to help protect the fishery for future generations???  And by the way our trips are more than annual and I feel as much as a resident as anyone, since we have gone to Rice Lake multiple times a year over the past 42 years and know Rice Lake as well as anyone on this forum.  I am done with this thread - no one is going to win and we all have our own views.  "
440777,Jer,2010-03-07 00:52:00,1426,"   ...and I'm hoping that future generations have the opportunity to enjoy a winter fishery in the Kawarthas. Judging by the numbers of children I've seen out with their parents on the ice enjoying the experience so far, I'm sure they will.  I'm glad you visit often and enjoy the area, isn't it great people can now enjoy all year long? Why not plan a winter trip and see what I mean first hand. You can hardly consider yourself a resident if you've only been in the warm summer months."

441414,Twocoda,2010-03-08 17:41:00,4130,"copy and paste from the article in the paper  ""Further data shows that only 5% to 8% of visiting non-residents harvest more than 300 fish (some reports like those from Ministry of Natural Resources (MNR) border crossing checks show boats leaving the province with staggering counts of Rice Lake sunfish numbering in the thousands).

441508,Beans,2010-03-08 22:53:00,3339," I beg to differ...we catch more sunfish/bluegills in the open water seasons than we do in the winter...in over sixty some odd years of icefishing I could probably count on both hands the number of sunfish/bluegills I have caught through the ice...lots of perch, some crappie but very few sunnies...  What I don't get with all this hullabaloo about Rice Lake and icefishing is...what about all the other lakes in the Kawartha chain and the rest of the lakes in zone 17 or 18 for that matter???...I read a lot of forums but don't hear of any other Tourist Association bellyaching about the new regulations...  Have any Rice Lake ice fishermen out there caught their daily limits this season ???...I highly doubt it if it is anything like my home lake (Pigeon)  I don't think there is anything to worry about depleting the resources...many more will find their way into Rice lake from below Hastings or from the lakes above Peterboro to replace those caught...same way the crappie/bluegills got here 20 years ago..."
441566,Jer,2010-03-09 00:42:00,1426,"I'm with you, Beans.  My buddy and I have spent countless hours on the ice this season. We've caught lots of perch of all sizes, only three crappie, a handful of bass, one musky to the hole, one pickeral, the odd rockbass and maybe a dozen sunfish.  Certainly haven't seen the sunfish leaving the lake by the cooler-load."
441584,BillM,2010-03-09 01:13:00,17367,So there are more people fishing Rice in the winter then the summer?  lol
441596,MillerPhoto,2010-03-09 01:45:00,147,"I've been away for a while, but just spent the last hour reading this whole disscussion...  I love to fish, I get out maybe 10-20 times a year, I don't care if I catch anything or not... I do it.. Cause I love it, and it calms me from the stresses of life and running a business full time.  Im 29 years old, and have been fishing for as long as I can remember.. For years I used to fish in Lakeport from shore in the spring and fall.. then fished Colborne Creek all summer for Specks and Bow PanFriers.. Now.. they are non existant.. Not because of over fishing.. but due to  lack of concentration by the ministry to try and help fix the creek..  Then for years I biked down to Murray Canal in the summer to fish the bass and pan fish.. Its always been decent fishing down there.. But now being able to drive for the last 12 years I have been going to Rice lake.. Not only is it great fishing.. but also great views and the ammenites near by..  People that say the locals don't help bring the money to the local resorts and such.. Need to think again.. How do they think the word gets out about the amazing fishing and Resorts, and businesses ON the lake... Word of mouth from the people that LIVE on that lake year round.. they live there for a reason... I know people that live at all ends of the lake and in between.. Any that live on the water and own a boat.. They would rather  take the boat to Bewdley, Gores Landing, Harwood for Food or Pizza, or Groceries.. rather then drive the car into Peterborough or Cobourg/Port Hope... And why deal with gas can and have them smelling up the car or truck, when they can take the boat or Jetski or what ever they have, and go to one of the local Marinas or Resorts and just Fuel up there...  The locals support more of the local community then is realized..   And yes I have been to a few of the resorts and used their ammenites.. Even rented boats from them in the summer cause I don't own a boat of my own.. And if the service is good and products are good.. I refer them to friends and such..  Personally I don't see the reason for having a high limit eaither way..  I don't belive any limit for even pan fish shouldn't be over 25 per person.. per day.. If people want more then that.. then maybe the MNR should look at having a ""Commercial"" type of licence that allow the higher limits..  But have those licences cost much more and are species specific.... like $175 a year or something..  Then that extra money can be used to put back into the fisheries.  Eaither way I see it..  the more pan fish.. means more food for the bigger fish..  and people wonder why the bigger fish numbers are dwindling on Walleye and Musky and such.. More food that the larger fish have.. the more they reproduce.. the more those parts of the fisheries rebound..  Personally I have always thought that the fisheries should have like a rotating season for different fish..  Or even rotating limits.. from season to season..   Anyways.. just wanted to give my two cents, some worth wile reading.. some useless.. eaither way.. I love Rice Lake and everything it has to offer.. From the Fishing to the local Ammenities.."
442111,MuskyGreenHorn,2010-03-10 09:27:00,158,"You hit the nail right on the head beans.  There is no eveidence what so ever that a hardwater season will hurt the bluegill, or any other species for that matter, hard.  The RLTA, is simply using that as an angle/leverage to argue for no limit and only open during the summer.  Its a smart tactic, and just about all they have anyway.   but they have no hard evedince/stats/science to back it up.  Now if they are right, then in a couple of years they will get their way and they can smile and say I told you so and we will all have to take it in stride.

Start doing some quick math if there is a family all taking limits....  Lets briefly consider the average portion of fish in a restaurant at 8-12oz....thats only 40-60 servings (for 30lbs of fillets). Is this enough?   Though if it is within the limits, harvest is at the perogative of the angler. I guess this amount of fish just never hit home with me."

440479,Ron,2010-03-06 02:02:00,1683,"Please fellow anglers,  Lets keep this civilized. There is no need to stoop to lower levels. Serious accusations against a member of this board have been brought forward.  I can't stress this enough, please keep it civilized or this thread may get locked!  Hey Mike  Actually, my big fish came in third last weekend. My Nephew, who was fishing with me, his fish came in first. Nice Perch too, 1.08 lbs.  As for the very reason why they should close Rice Lake to ice fishing? Can you imagine if all those pails were filled with Perch and Bluegills? Heaven forbid if it happend during the ice fishing season. Certainly wouldn't do half the damage during the spawning periods on open water now would it.(hint of sarcasm)  In the parking lot after the council meeting, I too started up conversation with a couple of RLTA members. It was in agreement about their passion and also about our passion. But keep in mind, don't be putting words in our mouth. As you have stated yourselves, and I quote your introduction sentence to the council ""I am here to represent the Rice Lake Tourist Association and I also represent my own resort (name withheld by my choice)"". Now with the remark, when you spoke about being against Ice Fishing were you speaking for the RLTA or were you speaking for your resort? You made it sound like you were representing the RLTA and in your  terminology with your presentation, were you sucking or were you blowing? Remember, you were the one who said you can't do both at the same time. You can't represent 2 different interests in a presentation can you?"

We the fisherman of Ontario Canada have rules we have to follow set out by the MNR and so do our brothers in the US when they fish here. Get use to it & get over it and move on with it!!!!!

Aside from a few, lets say ""new"" recruits to the board clearly only joining for there own agenda I am completely interested in the outcome of this post...I've read it thoroughly and really its pretty clean...not bad OFC'rs...and I'm talking to the salty old dogs not the fresh new fry..  My suggestion to the new guys, assuming your all members of the RLTA or the RLCA be nice....it's great to push your agenda and I support you for standing up for what I believe is a ridiculous cause...300 fish per day...not to mention an additional 80 for perch and crappie, but trash talking and racists comments may very well be why your bottom line is hitting the bottom...  I'll tell you all one thing....I DON'T BOOK A COTTAGE, GO TO AN UNKNOWN LAKE, TARGET A SPECIES I HAVE NEVER FISHED BEFORE...without checking on it with these boys first...To come on here and bash them, abuse this site, not to mention slander its (and in speaking I consider every member of this site a representative for it ) representatives, your not going to be doing much business with most of these boys anytime soon...  Just think you've spent all this time trying to tell us why you need to up these already outrageous limits to draw in the US clientel, when you could have been using this as an opportunity to draw in some business...Clearly your not concerned with our Canadian Dollars...therefore why should we be concerned with your lack there of?????  I'm still not understanding when you were just given the opportunity to increase your seasons to 12 months a year, your not wise enough to use this forum to your benefit to try to drum up some new business???? Lets see 6000 members, I'd say times that by 4 at least for friends we talk to about this board and our adventures (and thats low balling) you may have just cost yourself 24000 potential clients just for ignorance alone...You guys say that we don't come to Rice Lake for the pan fish, but I'll tell ya this show me a kid who's first fish wasn't a rock bass or sunfish or perch...Nobody takes there kids out for the first time targeting Musky...Panfish are the backbone of the fishing community without them the 4 year olds of today may never turn into the ladies and gentlemen of this board...

440583,jonnybass,2010-03-06 09:15:00,346,"   I agree with tightline that locking this thread would be a shame.  This is not only an interesting and relevant topic, but a very important issue for many people. IMO, you shouldn't shut down a conversation like this.  There are ways to moderate a discussion without shutting it down, as seems to always be the case here. No disrespect intended, just an observation.  I mean, Rick pointed out that this is the biggest fishing site in Canada, where over 35,000 people come every day to talk about fishing in Ontario! I think it's great that an unfolding story of local (and ultimately province-wide) public interest is getting this kind of exposure from both sides.  Why bury it?  We're seeing the politics at work that control our fishing resource. And we get to participate because of this forum. A+ for OFC!"
440585,MuskyGreenHorn,2010-03-06 09:39:00,158,"I dunno, its getting out of hand.  I think its time to lock it down before someone like myself overrides the Mayor proclaims and themslef the Priminister. ln all due respect a mayor is elected not self apointed.  Mr Mayor, I am a local and I am fisheries biologist.  You can come over and see my fancy papers hanging on the wall. Poaching happens all over the place regardless of limits, restrictions and seasons, thats why its called POACHING.  The members here do not claim to know more about what is best for the lake.  Really all we are doing is supporting what the MNR has decided.  they are telling us the lake needs a limit, so we simply support their hark work and efforts.  We also applaud them for additional seasonal opportunity.  If this new opportunity has a negative effect on the ecosystem, I am sure the MNR will adjust accordingly and we will respect that.  There are a few bad apples in every bushel.  That shouldn't spoil the rest.  It seems that a few in the RLTA are doing just that for them though.  We don't want anyone losing their lively hood and buisness.  But if they don't want to play by the same rules as the rest of the users of the lake than they can take a hike.  It appears that you want an open limit and no ice fishing? Why? How can you demonstraight to us that would be good for the lake?  Has rice really been pounded that hard this winter... I truely doubt that.  These rules are in effect for the entire zone 17.  If you guys really feel rice lake needs to be exempt for BIOLOGICAL reasons, i applaud you for voiceing your concern.  To all of us here though, it is plain to see that your intersts are centered on the dollar, bottom line, and not the fish.  Thats the MNRs job, they aren't out to get you.  Signed, The Biologist"
440594,Marc Thorpe,2010-03-06 11:09:00,621,"let me get this,So you can keep 50 perch and 300 panfish and eat em too  when the last time someone watch someone eating 50 perch let alone 300 panfish?  I'd be more concern of the ice holding up for those that can eat 300 pan fish!  I think a 50 perch and 50 panfish limit is suffice  we are living in the era of convenience,why are we so wasteful  300 panfish per person limit is not Biologically sound nor healthy for any fishery  If I may suggest,the service you offer your clients will surpass any possession limits set forth by any regulation established  there is much more to fishing than catching and harvesting"
440608,GregF2,2010-03-06 12:35:00,46,"Of course I get that point, but don't you get that it is obvious how much easier it is to catch those bigger perch ice fishing and why it is so contradictory setting limits (which I am for), but then allowing ice fishing?????  I give up - everyone is so focused on the limit of bluegills, but yet everyone does not focus on the extra fish people are taking out of the lake ice fishing.  This is obviously a one sided thread.  By the way, I don't agree that cottage owners are so bad, it sounds like just a couple bad apples.  I know for a fact the the cottage owner we stay it is all for conservation and also is against ice fishing.  Not against ice fishing, because it hurts his business, but because it may hurt the panfish fishery that we are trying so hard to protect.  It sounds like a few are speaking for the RLTA (ones that probably should not be) and a few are speaking for all anglers too.   "
440616,bigugli,2010-03-06 13:07:00,6138,There is a lot of bitterness in this thread that leaves a bad taste in the mouth. I doubt that I will feel too welcome at Rice after the dust has settled. Time to book elsewheres.  It will leave more room for the more desireable out-of -province guest that some RLTA members prefer.
440617,Jer,2010-03-06 13:18:00,1426,"Greg,  Do you have the opportunity to ice-fish back home in Ohio?  If so, why do you begrudge us the same opportunity?  I've lived on the shore of Upper Buckhorn for almost 14 years now, and until this year, was never allowed to drill a hole. Very frustrating at the least to have to travel at least an hour and a half in any direction to be able to fish in the winter when I have countless acres of safe ice right outside my door.  I've fished every available day this winter and just love it. In fact I'll be heading out very shortly on Chemong for what could be a T-shirt day on the ice, what could be better? Who are you to deny me this?  Even though I've fished probably 20 full days on the ice between Buckhorn & Chemong, I've only brought home a reasonable meal of perch and sunfish (about a dozen fish, Nanna's math is right) for my girlfriend and I 3 times in total. I could have filled buckets, but like the majority of fishermen, I try to be responsible and enjoy the opportunity with out abusing the resource."

Had they have not tried the pail stunt which I will be overturning in the newspaper come Monday have already contacted the press. I would not have eaposed them for their real agenda. I do not represent The Rice Lake Tourist Acc. in any way shape or form I have resinged from the board so I can deal with this in the same manner Mr. Brown and company are doing it I would never involve a well respected Acc. in this type of gutter fighting The Mayor
440406,cheaptackle,2010-03-06 00:42:00,849," But to what gain...? I must admit I really can't find any reason to side with what's being presented to support the RLTA or any of it's supporters.  It's just plain turned me off wanting anything to do with the lake or any business around it.  Any angler who is old enough or who has researched any kind of history knows the pressure on the resource exists GLOBALLY, and steps to manage it must be taken.  When they realize they've lost this battle what will they blame next?  HST is coming - maybe that might be a diversion!  Michael"

440431,GregF2,2010-03-06 01:08:00,46,"I don't get the perch pale point?  So, all those perch were harvested from Rice Lake Ice Fishing?  If so, that only proves the point that Ice Fishing should not be allowed on Rice Lake.  Even if they were not caught their, anyone that is for these limits on panfish, should be opposed to ice fishing on Rice Lake.  I find it utterly amazing that people are not pointing this out.  Ice fisherman (I love ice fishing, but not on Rice) take more panfish, more easily than summer fisherman.  So, this will put more pressure on the Rice Lake panfish population.  So, if we are all pure sportsman that practice conservation and want to preserve and make the Rice Lake fishery better for all, then we should keep the limit restrictions, but eliminate ice fishing. Pure, common sense."

440017,bigbuck,2010-03-05 01:46:00,2449,"Man oh Man!! There is no end to this!! I grew up panfishing Rice Lake. Setting a limit of 300 fish is nuts and a waste of time. The Rice lake Tourist Association needs a reality check. How many Americans actually come up to take home 300 sunfish?? The real problem is the high Canadian loonie coupled with a persistent recession in the U.S. Americans can't afford to come up here like they did a few years ago when the loonie was at 65 cents to the greenback. Unfortunately for the Canadian tourist trade, we hosers would rather go spend 800 loonies to go down to Cuba for a week in the winter then spend the same amount to rent a cottage for a week in the summer. It is too bad. Trying to change the government's mind on something WITH Scientific Facts backing you up is difficult enough, not having facts backing you up...........you are wasting your time and energy. Focus on saving your business, if it is not worth saving then just close the door and cut your losses. Times have changed, change with them or get left behind."
440102,Michael_Brown,2010-03-05 05:25:00,411,"Well four of us anglers attended the meeting along with 7-8 RLTA members and it was interesting to say the least. I presented exactly what we have talked about here. 300 sunfish is more than enough, it is good for the lakes, stops abusive harvest and offers a sustainable harvest for now and in the future. We brought in 50 perch in a pail and 7 other pails to show how many fish 1 person could harvest in 1 day under the new regulations. I used the line, it is a lake not a grocery store. I was fair to the RLTA, as I understand their concerns, and even polite in my address of them. Then as Ron has already pointed out, one of their members (aka Guardians of the Lake) stood up and stated that we were anti-american racists who should be wearing white sheets and pointy hats... I guess having an opinion that supports ethical harvest and a sustainable healthy population of panfish is the RLTA equivalent of the KKK. Never saw that angle coming to be honest but playing the race card worked for OJ so why not?  They are also for ice fishing but some of them are against ice fishing....I'm confused.  After the meeting Ron and I met with some of them and offered to help show them some new oppourtunities that they could work towards to improve their business. Wait and see. They can either adapt to the new regulations and drop in tourism from many factors or whine themselves bankrupt.  We did an interview with the Northumberland newspaper before the meeting and I know Pete G wrote a letter on this topic. To be honest the council spoke of getting phone calls and receiving mailed letters on this topic but no mention of reading e-mails or message boards. I think to be more effective we should start mailing letters and making phone calls. 35 members of the RLTA and they all send letters and make phone calls. 1 million or so anglers and ....cricket....cricket... We need to get better or our resource will continue to be run by small interest groups who are focused.  Our point was made and the council is going to review the information. The MNR staff gave a good presentation with lots of pictures.   Thanks for the support and if I dig up some council phone numbers maybe we could give up a few minutes each and call about our concerns.   A big thank you to Tomfoolery who took the time to show up and help the cause. Tom doesn't look like a anti-american racist but you never can tell.   For the record Tom, I'm from Ontario.... just in case.   I need a nap.    Mike B"
440153,northshore,2010-03-05 12:57:00,13,"Keeping 300 fish is just plain ridiculus, i've only panfished on Simcoe and start losing count after 2 dozen, how does anyone actually keep track of 300 fish?? They want 500 fish! just plain greedy - no one needs that many fish - with the price of gas, lodging, boats, tackle, etc etc.. it's cheaper to go to loblaws and buy a few bags of smelt. I'm digusted that ppl are complaining about this very liberal limit of 300 - already a gross over-harvest of fish. Panfish are not an unlimited resource - ya ya Rice Lake is huge - there are millions of fish - doesn't give anyone the right to fish farm it - i can't believe this caveman attitude still exists today. Lodge and Resort operators who think they own the lake and all the fish in it - well NEWS FLASH, you don't - the lake and all the fish in it belong to all of us - and i support any measures taken to preserve the fishery. The only part of Rice Lake you own is the 100 or so feet of frontage and maybe the 1 foot variable water line along the shore. What a joke.   FYI i would like to add - i have every right to flip my jigs under your docks, my boat and more importantly my jigs are on public property, and my jig has never landed on your wheel barrel imported sandy ""beaches""."
440201,Twocoda,2010-03-05 15:13:00,4130,"im just compelled to say this..( i truly wish i wasnt)....Ive only fished Rice a handful of times and rented cottages each time with a party of 10..usually on long weekends and pay premium dollars ....enjoyed ourselves to the utmost extremes that quite frankly we could have done anywhere .....those representing the RLTA and affiliated interests have now defeated their purpose of existence. To be blunt .... YOUR DOING MORE HARM THEN GOOD FOR THE RIGHT TO EARN MY TOURIST DOLLARS . You probably should have left this discussion in the meetings rather then on a open forum for your true colours to be exposed to the thousands of members of this community...ouch!!!!!! that could have adverse effects for awhile....( might be a good thing though ....cuz the fish population will grow if no one goes and you may get your 500 limit)....from where im sitting ....i hope 'big brother"" takes their sweet ole time doing the research to release an already outrageous catch limit to an even more outrageous catch limit...

440254,Michael_Brown,2010-03-05 17:40:00,411,"One thing I want to mention. Is that the RLTA members have already attended numerous municipal council meetings about these issues. We need to get going to catch up. I would recommend, if you are a member of a angling club or group (OFAH, Bassmaster, cottage assoc. etc) that you bring this topic up or call someone. They are trying to have Rice granted special status to make is seperate from other lakes in the zone. Personally I would grant this status and because Rice is showing the most signs of overharvest of the Bluegills, use this status to lower the limit to 50 or 30. Otherwise if it is granted the other cottage associations and resorts on our other great waterbodies would be left at a disadvantage. This would cause more harm than good for tourism but again they are only concerned with their pockets being full.  I am hoping to draft a letter that we could post so people could print it, sign it and mail it to local council members to show our opposition to these actions.  Any other ideas?  http://www.northumberlandtoday.com/Article....aspx?e=2478283"

They had their opportunity to have their say at the FMZ17 council meetings. If it happens here it could spread to other greedy lobbyists in other Kawartha lakes associations. It has only been 4 months since the regulation changes came into effect. If it had of been me owning a resort on the lake, or any lake on the Kawarthas for that matter, I would have been ready for the hard water season and embracing the changes as a new business venture.  Keep us advised boys and you can always count on my support.  Tom."
440269,TJQ,2010-03-05 18:36:00,7806,Does that 300 fish include perch or is it just sunfish/crappie??
440272,solopaddler,2010-03-05 18:45:00,8605," Thanks to you, Ron and others for standing up and representing the rest of us. I for one appreciate it! Absolutely amazing that they pulled the race card.    Great to see."
440277,Beans,2010-03-05 19:14:00,3339, The 300 limit is for sunfish/bluegills Boss (only 30 can be over 7 inches) Perch (50) and crappie (30) have their own limits...(any size)
440296,RandyC,2010-03-05 20:25:00,4,"Hey Mike .. met you the other day at the Council meeting.  First of all, I'd like to say I am a resort owner on Rice Lake and a VERY AVID ANGLER.  I respect your passion, you are fighting for what you believe in .. maybe not for all the right reasons, in my opinion, but YOU believe them .. and I respect that.  I would like to say there was a comment made at that meeting that was uncalled for by someone, that does NOT express the views of all resort owners, although I am here to speak for myself, period.  I read the article in the Northumberland Today and I would like to clarify a few things.  First of all, the limits you are talking about, a daily catch .. is also your FULL POSSESSION LIMIT .. therefore .. once your limit is caught, that's it.  I find what you are saying very misleading.  Second of all .. we are not after NO LIMITS .. nothing could be further from the truth.  The new regs, 30 crappie, I support 100% .... 50 perch, I support 100% ... new regs on muskie, I support 100% ... new slot size on walleye, I support 100% ... extended season to Dec 15 for bass, I support 100% ... sunfish, I can support a limit when there never was one but do firmly believe that the recommendations of the council should be adhered to on this one ... extended 12 month fishing season (FOR ANY SPECIES) I strongly oppose.  It encourages walleye poaching .. sorry to say but thats a fact!  There were stories at that meeting  yesterday that there was a 33"" walleye and a 9 lb walleye caught through the ice .. these fish were released but obviously kept out long enough to weigh and measure.  The chance that harm was caused to them is extremely high, they should have been released immediately.  Although I do support the extended bass season, it also allows for walleye fishermen to poach, yet again.  And we can say that poaching doesnt happen but we know that it does.  The extended season also opens the door to further walleye and even bass poaching in the spring ... now no one can question why the bass boat is out there in May, can they?  You also make it sound like you approached us after the meeting in an effort to give us new ideas on how to run our business.  Let's set that record straight .. WE approached YOU in an effort to be friendly and show some simple manners.  You offered an idea to me ... I should consider allowing people to fish off my docks for $5 per head.  Now .. let me see .. we have 12 cottages and enough car parking for those 12 cottages plus trailers from their boats and enough dock space for those registered guests to use.  There is no extra space , either in the parking lot or on the docks nor is there a central toilet facility for these ""daily"" visitors.  My guests feel completely comfortable leaving their fishing gear in their boats or beside their cottages at all times.  At $5 per head, I cannot justify policing things never mind the investment of thousands of dollars for a simple toilet facility.  It is my opinion that the extended season MUST be stopped .. it WILL ruin the lake and believe it or not, my MAIN concern IS THE LAKE!!!!!!!  Which we do not own nor have we ever stated that we own .. another misconception that YOU keep putting forth.  In our conversation in the parking lot yesterday, it was apparent to me that one of your main goals is for winter walleye fishing on this lake.  This was made evident by the comment of one of the gentlemen in your group when he said that the walleye population in Rice Lake could support a winter fishery.  Looks like we have another Lake Scugog on our hands!  I wonder if your followers understand that you are basically trying to shut down a business that brings almost $400 million dollars (as per the most recent posted stats, 2006 Ministry of Toursim data for County of Peterborough and County of Northumberland, total tourist spending) into the economy of this rather small region.  This is the equivalent to shutting down GM in Oshawa ... many jobs as well as tax dollars are at risk.  Tourist spending supports not only the few resorts on the lake but gas stations, restaurants, liquor stores, beer stores, movie theatres, grocery stores, drug stores, walmart .. to mention a few.  I wonder how many of you have wives and children that work at these establishments and how many of them will be impacted as the ripple effect begins to take hold.  You seem to be under the impression that winter fishing will compensate for the loss of summer business.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  The only income to the area will be day trippers who bring a bag lunch and a thermos .. and gas up before they leave home.  And I would like you to know how deeply our pocket is lined with gold ... so much so that I have had to drive a school bus for extra income while my wife worked for minimum wage .. sounds pretty darn golden to me!  You tell us to get off our lazy butts and advertise .. we have spent on average $10 - $15 thousand per year on advertising .. if that is not enough, then what???  You seem to have all the answers, Mike .. well come on over and make me an offer.  You know who I am.  Let's see if YOU can do better.  Shall I get the ""sold"" sign ready?  In closing, watch the economy of the surrounding areas collapse when we all shut our doors and walk away ... because Mike, as much as I respect your passion, its mis-guided.  Randy Cogar, Resort Owner  .. NOT hiding behind a false name"
440298,Roy,2010-03-05 20:34:00,13728,Thanks for posting your opinion Randy.   You might not be hiding but you appear to be using FishinNanna's computer.
440306,solopaddler,2010-03-05 21:09:00,8605," Now that's funny!  I have to say though I'm 100% opposed to an ice fishing season for walleye, for all the reasons that Randy/Nana expressed."
440314,RandyC,2010-03-05 21:37:00,4,Just want you to know that I am not Nana and alot of people other than myself and my wife use this computer.  I have never and will never HIDE ..
440315,Terry,2010-03-05 21:38:00,14456,"I too am opposed to walleye icefishing on the shallow Kawartha lakes....  how is he trying to shut down your business, things do change as in every business and life  it'self . you adapt or die...... P.S. RLTA do not owner the lake the people of Canada do."
440323,crappieperchhunter,2010-03-05 21:58:00,2582," Not quite sure how you can make this statement. Did you try to have an open business for this winter? Even if you did... how could you possibly blame a regulation change that has only been in effect for 64 days  And with the GLOBAL economy being in the dumper for the last 2 years, I'm sure your business was hurting during that time period which had nothing to do with this new regulation.  A core group of us used  to do a  trip every spring and fall to various places for mostly walleye,fly in lakes and drive too lakes. Out of all those trips we only ever brought home fish once. And there is lots out there like us. I truly hope you can find yourself some repeat clientele who are not meat hunters. You maybe able to use today's crappy economy to get the MNR to grant you special regulations for Rice, but believe me those meat hunter days are numbered. I hope they are gone for good myself.  Believe me when I say I envy anyone who makes a living doing what you do. Find a niche market that doesn't  cater to meat hunters and treat them right and you will be fine. Rice is a great lake very close to the GTA and surrounding areas. Your location is PRIME. Good luck at coming through this."
440335,RandyC,2010-03-05 22:47:00,4,"Thank you Terry and crappieperchhunter .. I'm glad you agree about the extended season being very harmful to the overall health of the lake.  Again .. so everyone understands ... I am only speaking for myself and for MY business.  We personally have never had (since we've owned the resort) meat hunters.  I personally do not think that there is a problem with the 300 limit.  I do, however, think that extending the season while imposing limits is contradictory and not in the best interests of conservation.  I also feel that since this ""council"" worked so long and hard on this subject that they should know what they are talking about and should be listened to, that's my only logic for wanting 500.  Remember .. MY LOGIC ... not anybody elses.  Regarding opening this season (now past) ... our insurers insisted that we incorporate another company in order to do anything involved with winter fishery or they wouldnt even consider insuring us.  We were notified mid to end of November of the new regs which left very little time to pull it together, if we chose to.  By the time you do the math of incorporating a new company, insurance, washroom and water facilities (which we do not have in cold weather ... our water comes from lines in the lake that goes through a filtration system, non of which is heated so as not to freeze) .. the cost of a few sheets of plywood was the least of it.  It's just not as simple as some people seem to think it is .. not if you want to do it by the law and by the book.  Sometimes you really need to walk a mile in someone elses shoes in order to know what you are talking about.  I also find, for MYSELF, I could not morally do the ice fishing thing when I am so set against it.  Not everything is about the almight dollar.  We are very lucky to have numerous guests that come year after year, many of whom catch and release.  Bottom line, guys .. the panfish issue is all smoke and mirrors .. it's to open the door and take our minds off the walleye and so that they can slip it through.  Unless we do something about it now, winter walleye fishing will be in place by next year, I absolutely believe this ... and it was proven to me verbally by one of the angler guys at the meeting the other day with his comment.  Randy"
440342,crappieperchhunter,2010-03-05 23:11:00,2582,"  You must have misunderstood me. I absolutely do NOT think the extended season will be harmful at all. I want to be absolutely clear on that.  No one said owning your own business was going to be a bed of roses. But the rewards are many. Good luck with trying to convert things over to accommodate winter guests. I understand what you have ahead of you in that department. However,it will pay off in the long run."
440348,cheaptackle,2010-03-05 23:18:00,849,"Wow - the RLTA wants the MNR to overide the DFO to change an individual lakes FMZ (acronym brain freeze now!) regs - have I got that right?  Does the RLTA understand that all this involves multiple tiers of government that never moves quickly?  Is that why they have started posting here, on an anglers forum, looking for support?  After the fact of all the meetings & discussions, presentations and opportunity for input?  Somehow methinks approaching this from the municipal level ain't gonna cut it, and certainly not going to find sympathy here from the sounds of it.  Singling out scientifically based in fact efforts at resource conservation as potential threats to a business sector in a repressed economy can only be doing one thing - costing the complainers MORE of their proclaimed scarce dollars!  How come only the RLTA is sqwaking?  Haven't hear any other lake association crying about the new regs. Fellas (& gals!), I say this only once, feel free to chip in, Rice Lake was once one I enjoyed, albeit too infrequently.  I've never been one to enter a conflict zone as long as my eyes were open, as they are now.  Good thing for me there's many other lakes to fish in.  I hope the RLTA realizes the damage they are doing to their entire community BEFORE many more begin to think like I do, in that I really don't want to spend my recreation time and DOLLARS somewhere that is in conflict with the rules I have to obey (and agree with) - kinda makes me feel like I don't belong!  Michael"
440354,irishfield,2010-03-05 23:32:00,26272,"I'm sorry Randy.. find another insurer. They won't insure for what reason.. fear of someone going thru the ice? You run a resort... been there.. done that with with my f-in-law... a 175 site campground.. and yes he drove a school bus in winter to make ends meet as well!! Insurance is a yearly thing.. value of the asset you want covered + liability coverage. Why would you even ask them about ""what if we offered ice fishing"". Just do it.. you've already paid to be covered for a year of liability from the greedy pricks.  If not... so what, do what they want.. $1100 for another Ontario Number (available through your Lawyer at said cost within 2 weeks.. mine use to keep ""numbers"" on the shelf so clients could have one the next day.. since been outlawed). If the resort is in your name... rent it to your spouse for the winter season... to cover your living costs pre tax and get a chequing account for the new business number.. $65 for a few hundred cheques that will last you a decade.  Water is of course an issue. Do you live there at all in the winter.. or elsewhere? Is this the main reason you don't want to make a go at the winter season.... you aren't there in the ""off season"" and enjoying the deep south like many resort owners do. If you are there.. you must have a water source that doesn't freeze.. tap into it. A full day with a small hoe and some 1""poly pipes.. or are the cabins uninsulated as well. I know.. it never ends.... but Adapt.. embrace... or as you've already alluded to. .. SELL."
440358,Mayor of Rice lake,2010-03-05 23:41:00,15,ReplyI also heard the comment made at yesterdays meeting and I believe it was right on the money The avid fisherman are in my eyes some of the most crooked people in the mix here your group yesterday consisted of at least one poacher one crook your perch was caught in lake simcoe very legal no problem till one of yous tried to enter one of the fish in a small Rice lake derby. This person was under suspicion right from the start he lost any way by a rice lake fish we won't question the integrity of that. also have witnessed one of your group filling five gallon buckets of crappie. ask your group which one of them  were holding the spear or the light many evenings around Idelwyld and goose creek. Every one of you know one in one thousand Canadians fish blue gills What was said about you and your group hating Americans was exactly the truth if you and your group had of entered the room in your hat and sheet. instead of your pails for that ridicoulous presentatiom.One of the councilours even rolled there eyes at that so that is the weight you carried with that council. I would have respected you fellas alot if you had of just represented yourselves honestly Have a nice day Mike and I will be at every meeting to expose your little group Mayor of Rice lake
440361,Terry,2010-03-05 23:50:00,14456,as I always say if you can win a fight with facts then just attack the integrity of the opposing party ..much like our government does every election
439468,FishinNanna,2010-03-04 00:34:00,15,"Islander .... you just said it ..... a winter walleye fishery!    I think that's what some of these fellas are pushing for, they don't really give a **** about the panfish at all, it's simply a way to open the door.  Sneaky ..  And you are so right ... there were far from ""thousands"" out there .. goddness me!!!!!  Such exageration, that's what causes the problems.  Get real or hush .. if you can't tell the truth then just plain be quiet!  Thank you Tightline, hope we can continue to share ideas .. that's when greaet things happen"
439470,tightline,2010-03-04 00:43:00,322,"Just wanted to say that I actually looked into a Rice Lake ice fishing trip before I decided to go to Idle Tymes <---(awesome people had to plug) on Nippising...The only reason I didn't was because of the very limited information I could find...a few more years and a bit of advertising, you'll see results...Just have to get the word on the streets, being reputable and respectable to and for our fisheries is a good way to start...just sayin"
439477,Michael_Brown,2010-03-04 00:57:00,411,"  I'm not sure where you are getting your information, the 500 limit with none over 7 inches was proposed by the member from the RLTA on the council. It was not a number brought forward by the MNR or OFAH. In fact the number prefered by the angler stakeholders on the council was more in line with the other panfish limits of 30 or 50. The 300 number of fish under 7 inches was a pure concession to the cottage associations and now they want more. No happy medium? The anglers wanted a limit of 30 and the limit is now 300 and the cottage associations wanted a limit of 500 and the limit is now 300, that would be considered a compromise. I think we should take the same approach as the RLTA and we will start to lobby the MNR for the limits to be reduced to 30 to represent the opinions of the resident anglers who outnumber the RLTA by tens of thousands to 1 (approx).  The unfortunate part of this arguement is that is works against the role of the council. A lot of work was done over three years by the MNR staff, stakeholder representatives and volunteers to bring forth one of the most up-to-date and well researched set of regulations in the province. The MNR shared their information with the skakeholders from 20 different groups that have interests in the local fishery. Hundreds attended public meetings held on these topics, even more completed surveys about the issues, the council recommendations was only one part of the information reviewed for the new regulations. It allowed a venue for groups like the RLTA and recreational anglers to contribute their ideas and concerns about the fishery resources in FMZ 17.  The fact the one group is now undermining that work and research because they didn't get exactly what they wanted is discouraging. I believe it is in the interests of all stakeholder groups to support this kind of a public process with any government agency as it is far better than not being involved in decisions that affect the resource.  Big brother as they are being referred to is trying to listen and provide regulations that meets the needs of the resource and the best interests of the stakeholders.  I am done with this he said she said on this topic, all of the research, minutes of meetings and other information is available from the council process. I fully support the work of the council and all of it's stakeholders.  I will be at the meeting tomorrow in Grafton to defend the rights and interests of the anglers of this great area and if needed other future meetings. Please join myself and other anglers who support a healthy fishery in Rice Lake and every other lake in the province."
439481,solopaddler,2010-03-04 01:04:00,8605, It's perfectly obvious who decided on the number. It certainly doesn't make it right.  Who lobbied for the outrageous limits?
439486,Dara,2010-03-04 01:11:00,3052,"  See what I said before?  If it doesn't affect me personally i should have nothing to say?  Just the people directly affected can have an opinion?  Thats how we ended up with no spring bear hunt, and its also how we ended up with a gun registry. People saying, it doesn't affect me so I will let the government walk all over the people it does affect.  If a law makes sense then fine, but I want to see how the decision was made.  PS adda few fries, a salad and some bread, then you can get away with a few less fish I know I wouldn't want to clean 500 sunfish...thats way too many wobbly pops"
439493,Dutch,2010-03-04 01:21:00,831,"I decided I would weigh in on this one.  If I am reading things above right, It sounds like the major disagreement revolves around the 300 fish limit, with 30 over 7"" vs. a 500 fish limit with none over 7"" allowed.  Is it really the opinion of the RLTA that a difference of 200 fish is to blame for the decreased bookings?  That is hard to fathom - sure it is 200 fish, but if one of our friends from the us heard that they would get 500 instead of 300, would that really bring them back?  I think it is time to put this thread to bed, I enjoy the back-and-forth, but really, we're getting nowhere.  We have a couple of new members out of this, hopefully they stick around and add value to some other threads, but now we are about bordering on insanity.  Methinks there are other things at play here, the timing of the sign-ups just don't flow.  It's not often that a new member with 12 posts, or 2 or whatever with 90% in the same topic is here for the long term.  ""Islander .... you just said it ..... a winter walleye fishery! I think that's what some of these fellas are pushing for, they don't really give a damn about the panfish at all, it's simply a way to open the door""  There even ganging up...who are these ""fellas"" pushing for a winter walleye season....dellusional.  I smell a troll...."
439498,FishinNanna,2010-03-04 01:28:00,15,"Now that there is a limit .. you call it outragous.  Before Jan 1/10, when there was no limit .. you never said a thing about it then, is my bet.  Probably never gave what seemed to be a non-issue the time of day.  Mr Brown ... do you continue to refer to the RLTA as a cottage association in an effort to further antagonize people?  Please .. you know precisely who they are and it would stand you in good stead to show your manners and refer to them as such.  ""They"" are the Rice Lake Tourist Association ... and those of them that I know are very hard working, honest, salt of the earth people.  I take it as a personal insult when you attempt to attack them with your low browed, smarmy comments.  This child-like behaviour is unnecessary and merely shows the level of intellect."

Looking at your recent posts and I guess I should mention.... Welcome to the board, though most people introduce themselves first. Chances are, I will meet you at the council meeting in Grafton. My name is Ron Reyns, I live in Cobourg. I too was on the advisory council. Perhaps as you are well aware, there are some replies to this thread from other people who were also on the advisory council but seem to be too ashamed to enunciate themselves, to each their own I guess. Some like to hide behind a screen name.  To echo Mike's responses, they are more accurate to what was discussed and suggested by the MAJORITY of the advisory council. As Mike had mentioned, some suggestions given for sunfish limits were as low as 50 with only 5 over 8 inches.  I will go over the many many dicussions on panfish and see if I can't find the actual numbers. It is tough to make replies with ""opinions"" rather than using facts which can be backed by evidence.  Sorry I'm the type of guy who does proper research, much like Mike Brown, before I give a reply.  Opinions are like an   , everyone's got one. Some people talk through theirs.  Cheers, Ron..."

If you want a scapegoat for your financial woes, don't look at the MNR. I drive 5 hellish hours to get to the West Arm of Lake Nippissing for three days each year. I get to take home four walleye. I never do it. Going there is about the experience. I had hoped as anglers we had evolved past the meat-hunter stage, but it looks like some people want to keep us there. I call absolute and total Bull on the 300 limit being the cause of bookings issues. How about doing some advertising? How about on the busiest fishing site in Canada??? I can't believe none of the RLTA saw the irony of trying to drag up support on a big site like this and never thought about using it for PROMOTION!! We have had new members jump on to chime in as the RTLA tries to rally troops and make it look like these peoples were simple passers-by. The MNR goes through an insane amount of paperwork and research to set limits and seasons. Stop focusing on the negative and start looking at the fact that you can now have guests YEAR ROUND!! The price is a sane and reasonable limit of fish. You get input on the limits, but you don't get a vote. Your vote comes at election time. If a sunfish weighs a pound and you get 6 ounces of fillets, you have over 100 pounds of fish. That is an insane amount of fish.  The MNR would not have made another law, another rule to enforce (more money spent) had it not been necessary. MNR is not big brother, they are charged with the implementation and enforcement of regulations designed to ensure a long term resource. The fish belong to all Ontarians...not just the RTLA."

439629,Jer,2010-03-04 11:44:00,1426,"  OK...I did the math...  300 fish...3 - 6 fish each...feeds a family of 50 -100 (that's a big family)  Family of five (seems more reasonable)...thats 10 - 20 meals.  I couldn't imagine going on a fishing trip and bringing home enough fish to feed my family 20 meals, that's just greedy.  It's even worse if you figure the whole family of five came along for the trip, then they could take home as many as 1500 fish, or enough for as many as 50 - 100 meals, once or twice a week for the entire year.  If your clients are cancelling their trips because that's not enough fish, maybe it's better they stay home."
439644,swishmick,2010-03-04 12:54:00,8,"Another link with a lot of excellent info on this issue:  www.mnr.gov.on.ca/264336.pdf  From page 66:  “In the late 1990s, concerns regarding the quality of the panfish (particularly bluegill) fishery in Rice Lake were raised.  MNR initiated a review of panfish management, and  attempted  to  work  with  local  businesses  and  anglers  to  explore  regulatory options  to  address  concerns  regarding  the  fishing  quality.    After  research  and extensive  consultation,  it  was  determined  that  there  was  public  concern  over  the decline  in  both  abundance  and  size  of  bluegill  in  Rice  Lake,  overexploitation  and undervaluing of the resource.  However, it was also identified that regulations were not required to sustain the stocks, but may be a useful tool to maintain fishing quality and marketability.  No regulations were implemented as a result of this review. ”  In “the late 90's” this issue came up and nothing was done about it for at least a decade.  To go from “no limits” to 300 is a bit arbitrary, and I think that giving the extra 200, even temporarily, to ease the transition for some that are hurting is reasonable – these are sunfish and the MNR thought nothing of putting ""no limit"" on them for years and years.  The MNR creates non-native trout and salmon opportunities for other groups at great cost; this costs nothing and yet they're getting screwed.  There must be some who suffered from the cancellation of the spring bear hunt that can sympathize; giving the outfitters an adjustment period would probably have saved them a lot of money.  OTOH, maybe that cancellation improved the quality, abundance and size structure of the bear population for the fall hunt.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   A fair number of people are of the opinion that those who fish for meat are the most ethical.  It could one day end up being the “sport's” savior.   What's the alternative, to believe that they're here to waste everyone's time for the heck of it?   Come here, get your association painted as a bunch of fools, and call it promotion!?  RLTA didn't start the thread in the first place; if anything, they're probably grateful to have the chance defend themselves and offer their perspective.   Kill a bear or deer or moose – what an “insane” amount of meat.  Kill a 100 pound wolf – what an “insane” amount of rot.  You can kill an unlimited number of Ontario mammals vermin, a veritable zoo of mammals - what an ""insane"" amount of killing.  Why are sunfish so sacrosanct?   Yes, and the RLTA isn't trying to curtail anyone's access or claim sole ownership.     FWIW to the more cynical on this board, I'm not an RLTA member."
439653,solopaddler,2010-03-04 13:36:00,8605," Okay, then what exactly is your interest in this issue?  No personal stake whatsover?"
439664,swishmick,2010-03-04 14:09:00,8,"  Not an RLTA member, and no personal stake.  As a citizen, I certainly care about how the MNR's decisions impact Ontarians and their businesses - doesn't almost everyone on this board?"
439665,troutologist,2010-03-04 14:11:00,951,"Ahh frozen fish, nothing like the freezer burn of keeping an unnecessary amount of your catch in the icebox too long.   Ron and Michael, please pass on the happenings from the upcoming meeting. Keep up the good work.   To the folks from the Rice Lake Tourist Consortium (and those with no or moderate amounts of stake in this), perhaps look past alot of the bickering and use this as an opportunity to rethink promotion and advertising, most likely these limits are here to stay and your bottom line would be better served working with them than fighting them."
439669,Guest gbfisher,2010-03-04 14:24:00,0,I'd think I was at an ARF meeting where they teach people how not to blame everyone else. It's a limit issue ladies(  ) and gentlemen. You live in Ontario where limits are the rule. Get used to it. Money short?.....go figure!!! Have you looked at the economy lately?   Nobody wants to come to fish at my resort because they can only take home 300 fish.  .......  DRY UP!
439843,hirk,2010-03-04 21:12:00,571,"This is getting very muddled.The readers digest of it all is simple,a special interest group is trying to change public policy concerning a public resource for it's own benefit.The policy was arrived at based a degree of science/study,I have yet to see any such validated science/data put forth by the rlta that supports their postition and justifies the change(s) they desire.I fish there often and have rented cabins and do spend a few $'s while visiting and feel for the hit the resorts have taken as I've seen a few go under and low occupancies etc. but I'm sorry you as a group are still a whisper among the many voices of groups/people that should have a legitimate say in Rice lakes future."
439888,Ron,2010-03-04 22:43:00,1683,"Well the council meeting went rather well. I will post more on the remarks once I receive the minutes from the Alnwick, Haldimand Township. Rather had a very comical moment though. Talk about someone shooting themselves in the foot!!! Mike Ferguson of Fergs live bait in Gores Landing actually labeled us as anti US people who are dead against tourist fishing Rice Lake, as he put it:""We should be wearing white sheets"". This is the same guy who called his American customers at one of the public meetings last year as ""Redneck Hillbillies from the Backwoods, who did not have running water"".He disagreed that the limit of Perch we had on hand to show the amount of fish did not represent the amount of Bluegills that could fit in one pail.  Good show Mike! Hope you speak up at more meetings, you really help your group of ""Guardians of Rice Lake"". I wonder how many more members you have in this group Mike? Mike is also a member of the RLTA.  Cheers, Ron..."
439987,Dutch,2010-03-05 00:54:00,831," Hey Ron - I remember that guy from the meeting at the Navy Club - good for a few rather uncomfortable laughs.  If I remember correctly, it was in the context that US stakeholders wouldn't be able to provide feedback as they didn't have internet - good ól boys that don't even have running water....guess I know where NOT to get my bait from.  Anyway, glad the meeting went well.  Couldn't make it due to work, but I'm sure you and Michael gave 'em hell.  Hope to hear a recap soon.  Did you get to Nana?"
439994,Roy,2010-03-05 01:04:00,13728,Mr. Ferguson is also a recently registered member of our community..... AKA Mayor of Rice Lake.
439165,Michael_Brown,2010-03-03 03:54:00,411, I thought we had with a 300/30 limit. I am perfectly comfortable accepting the limits and regulation changes as they are. I will however stand firm on recreational anglers rights and the protection of the resource.
439180,FishinNanna,2010-03-03 04:21:00,15,"What do you mean by the recreational anglers rights and the protection of the resource .. please explain.  I get the feeling that most people want to protect the resource but that you seem to be at odds on HOW to protect .. am I correct?   Sorry if I am confused by this, but I truly feel you all have the same interest at heart but are coming at it from different angles and merely arguing the angle.  Nanna"
439181,northshore,2010-03-03 04:26:00,13,"the limits are good - sunfish, bass, walleye or whatever - stop the greed - Rice lake has been rapped for years and i'm happy she's finally being treated with some respect - although I don't completely agree with the winter fishery - that's a whole nother can of worms - the sunfish limit is important - all fish are important to the health of a lake - not just the predators - a lake is a balance of all the fish species - and if you overharvest one species - you effect the populations of all of them - today's anglers with all the gear, maps, gps, sonar etc can effectively make a species go extinct in a lake - not that the sunfish will go extinct on Rice - but harvesting all the 'fat' ones 1000 at a time - will weaken the population - since the big ones ie.more successful healthy ones are gone - only the dinks will spawn and you will end up with a population of genetically inferiour dinks. The science has been done, the studies complete and the limits are imposed in the best interest of the fish stocks - Yes the meat hunters are unhappy - but the fish are for all to enjoy, both present and future - fishing is not about how many fish you can catch, kill and eat - it's about the past time - the enjoyment of the outdoors - the thrill of the chase and the good times with friends. Stop whinning about the loss of business from the meat hunters, cuz when the fish are gone - they will be too - target the real anglers, families and avid outdoors people  - they will come back, again and again.. i do.. every year - rent and fish and enjoy.."
439182,bigfish1965,2010-03-03 04:30:00,3382," Pretty simple... Anglers, by and large, trust the MNR when they say their studies show that certain limits, seasons and restrictions are needed to sustain a fishery. We have seen the success of their conclusions and have a fairly high degree of respect for these plans. It took a long time for us to see that value of releasing bigger fish and keeping smaller ones..but it works.  There is much doubt about the resort operators objectives since their chief concern and complaint is about a potential loss of revenue.  Commercial interests have often (and I am not saying this is the case here) less long term concerns than do private citizens. (see East Coast Cod Fishery)"
439188,FishinNanna,2010-03-03 04:44:00,15,"Well I must agree that a limit is fine.  I also must agree that I am not in favour of the winter fishery .. to me it goes against the limits .. they equal a net result.  Now, in all my reading, I don't quite agree with you that the resort operators are the problem.  I'm sure they have had guests over the years that were glutanous, yes.  But not every one is.  And there are many catch and release people who again help to balance the scale against those who take more than their fair share.  Again, we can't paint them all with the same brush .. agreed??   Perhaps there are a few resorts that operate as you say .. but there are also many that do not.  I know a few people in this business and I know how hard they work and for very little money .. that doesnt seem like lining their pockets to me.  The ones I know have their hearts and souls in their business and the last thing they want is for the fish population to be in peril .. it's their livelihood for goodness sakes .. can't you see that?  They have invested their entire lives in this and they want a good outcome.  I don't mean to argue .. I just think that you really must look just a litle further to find the real truth.  Not all black and white, my dear.  Thank you for allowing me to speak my mind .. and for listeneing and for answering my questions.  Educating ourselves is the key .. sharing knowledge helps us all to learn .. and we never stop learning.  Nanna"
439192,bigfish1965,2010-03-03 05:04:00,3382," But, Nanna, it is the limit the operators want removed. They want wide open no-limit fishing. the MNR has said that opening the lake to ice fishing would mean a limit of 300 fish. This would, I suppose, make the overall yearly take about what it was when it was a soft water only fishery. They already have the added benefit of now offering year round fishing, so I fail to see the resistance to a limit as anything sensible. The MNR does creel census data each year. They have a rough idea on what percentage of anglers take what. They know X% will take none while Y% will take 100. Using this they can try and set numbers which do not assume everyone will do it, but that some will take a full limit and some will take none."
439195,FishinNanna,2010-03-03 05:15:00,15,"Are you positive about this, Rick?  Because that is not my understanding at all.  From what I can gleen (keeping my ear to the ground, so to speak) the ones that I have listened to do not mind a limit but don't understand the limit being not what it was originally supposed to be, and then on the other hand opening the winter fishery.  Quite honestly, having raised more than my fair share of children and now the grands, winter time is not the optimum time to show them the joys of fishing.  Their little feet get cold no matter what .. and then the boredom sets in.  And that's no fun.  For anyone.  It seems that the winter fishery is more the problem here.  Only the local fells and gals are the ones that will make use of it.  And some may abuse it, as well.  I don't know but I still think some things should just be let alone.  Let the poor old lady (lake) have a rest .. she's tired, like me.  Nanna"
439197,kerr,2010-03-03 05:21:00,77,"just been reading this post for awhile now, and cant really understand what all the fuss is over these bluegills.if the limit is 300 then so be it i can not imagine cleaning that many anyway. personally i dont like the new panfish quota because i find it could be a little confusing for people and left open to interpretation ie: 7+ inches for 30, 270 under 7 which is a lot of fish to keep track of and could easily be messed up by an angler. i am glad that i am not a bluegiller because of this. because of rice lake's proximity to Toronto and being a kawartha area lake with lots of tourism, it does get pummelled non stop which i have seen get worse and worse year after year so i am sure there is a good reason for said limits. i think people sometimes jump the gun when there are changes without giving them a chance to take shape. give it time, THEY ARE BLUEGILLS THEY WILL SURVIVE BABY!"
439199,bigfish1965,2010-03-03 05:34:00,3382," Here is a bit of the original newspaper story....bolded text added for emphasis...  Brough writes that during the meetings, no info on sunfish limits were suggested, however those in attendance refute her statement saying it was quite well covered."
439220,BillM,2010-03-03 12:45:00,17367,"Wait, people canceled vacations because a sunfish limit was imposed?  Riiiiight.  Are we sure it just wasn't because the economy was in a complete downward spiral and people couldn't afford a summer vacation?"
439261,islander,2010-03-03 15:27:00,11,"Hi, I'm new here.  I have lived and worked on Rice Lake for decades now and have read these posts with interest.  Some things I've noticed...  Since when is the MNR all-knowing and considerate of tourism, basing their regulations on pure science - Spring bear hunt?  There NEVER EVER were any limits for panfish on Rice Lake before January 1st 2010 and from what I have learned the populations of these fish in our lake are among the largest and healthiest anywhere - I have always been able to catch bluegill > 8"" which is a good size.  I have seen LESS fishermen on the lake in the past few years and the local businesses are quieter than they used to be, some places have closed and others are barely hanging on.  Do the bluegill on Rice Lake need protection NOW before they are wiped out? They did just fine when there was lots of fishermen, why now?  Do the small businesses that cater to fishermen need protection from Big Brother (MNR) and homespun conservationalists trying to protect fish that don't NEED protection?  It seems that way to me.  Have fun out there!  Islander"
439325,FishinNanna,2010-03-03 18:08:00,15,"Let me start today by saying that I agree with you, Islander .. whole heartedly on all points!!!  Secondly .. I've been a busy Nanna over the last day or so .. I've called everyone I know on and around the lake, resort opertors and private individuals and I've read everything I can get my paws on .. and I think there is a rather large misunderstanding here.  Seems that some things have been taken out of context (that were in print) and some things have been printed incorrectly and / or, again, out of context to what was truly said.  Well, this could sure ignite a fire, now couldnt it!!  So here it is .. in brief and in black and white from an old lady that's been around the block a time or two.  This group (council) that was put in place to investigate what should happen with the regulations voted on and recommended a sunfish limit of 500.  This was a majority vote.  Biologists agreed that there was ""no problem with quanity of fish, but sizes were down"".  The resort group feels that 500 is the number that should be in place, as it was voted on and recommended .. they ARE NOT trying to revert to the old regs of no limits!!  The other question that I hear, if fish are in jeopardy (in any way) and limits are imposed to save them, then how can you open them up to a 12 month season from what was an approx 6 month season ... these two thoughts are in contradiction to each other and make no sense.  Like Islander, I know that there are far less fishermen out there .. I do the kitchen window test .. I look out and I see .. less and less over the past 6 yrs or so.  Being one who frequents our local casino, I enjoy numbers .... more fishermen catch more fish ... less fishermen catch less fish.  Pretty simple math.  And I know that I've been catching more and bigger fish year upon year for the last 5 - 6 years.  So .. what on earth is the problem?????"
439335,troutologist,2010-03-03 18:34:00,951,
439351,FishinNanna,2010-03-03 19:35:00,15,"Not sure how to do the fancy quoting that you do .... the 500 was the number that the MNF and OFAH and biologists and fishing clubs and stakeholders came up with in a majority vote.  The 300 is a number that was pulled out of nowhere.  Trout .. you are in Winnipeg .. how much do you know about our area?  I think kitchen window tests and anecdotal evidence weight alot heavier than you think ... speak to Elders, on and off First Nations Reservations .. what I mean by that is truly, speak to your elders, those who've been walking the earth alot longer and have watched what has been happening over time.  Many times, they are far wiser than the wisecrackers who make up our government and our laws.  Big brother is all about the money .. the individuals are the ones who truly care!"
439359,solopaddler,2010-03-03 19:54:00,8605,I feel compelled to offer a rebuttal to FishinNana but can't. Who 's gonna argue with someone's Nanna? 
439360,troutologist,2010-03-03 19:55:00,951,"True I do live in Winnipeg, however have lived in S Ontario for a number of years, but to understand the issue I need know nothing of Rice Lake. This same scene is mimiced across the country when armchair scientists decide they know how to better manage things than Big Brother.  Now you introduce the topic of traditional ecological knowlegdge or local ecological knowledge, yes this does hold alot of weight in how governemnt scientists approach an issue.  But TEK/LEK should be treated similar to peer review in science documents, where is the info coming from? Can it be corraborated? Granted this information is extremely valuable and useful, still management decisions cannot be placed soley on this.  I understand this issue very well as I work with it daily.  I take it you have a vested interest in this issue?  If Big Brother is all about money, why would they add another limit to enforce, why add more season to enfore? Why use this limit to reduce tourism and miss out on all the license fees etc?"
439368,Rice Laker,2010-03-03 20:15:00,24,"Last night Michael Brown wrote ""You must think if we stopped all fishing for bluegill in Rice Lake that they would start overflowing the banks. If we did not harvest a single fish from Rice, guess what the populations will find a sustainable level and balance"" No, I don't agree with the first sentence and fully agree with the second. However, the big question is when that level and balance will be reached. Many people that actually live on the lake have seen in the last 2 years bluegills spawning in areas that have never spawned in before. They are expanding and Rice Lake is a huge lake. In a straight line, one end to the the other is about 36Km, so 72 Km for both sides, add 50% for all the bays and points and you have shoreline of over 100Kms. Add in the many islands that also have ideal spawning grounds and you have even more Kms. Rice Lake is unique, definitely different to the other Kawartha lakes, shalllow and very eutrophic. If there is only so much food to go around and there are more and more bluegills, guess what, they will be stunted. Exactly the situation we have now, not enough big ones.  Michael also wrote ""the problem is that any child fishing off their dock who caught a sunfish larger than 7 inches would be breaking the law. These fish are responsible for helping to recruite new anglers that the entire industry/sport needs. This would have been unacceptable"" I agree, but as I mentioned in an earlier posting you are putting bluegills in a second tier of fish. Would you make the same comment about walleye or muskie? Should not all species be treated with the same respect? Measuring is not difficult, buy a 1""X2"", cut off 7"" and you can use the rest to make walleye measuring sticks......  Personally, I would have thought that having the kids measure bluegills would be a good introduction to explaining why size limits are necessary and important. Then when they ""graduate"" to walleye, muskie and other species with a size limit they are more likely to understand the reasoning and respect it.  One final comment, the newspaper article that started this whole thread was incorrect. We do not want to go back to ""No Limits"", we would like what the FMZ 17 Council recommended, 500 with none over 7"""
439425,crappieperchhunter,2010-03-03 22:47:00,2582,"Honestly 300 or 500. Makes no difference to me. I fish gills quite a bit throughout the summer, cause I just plain enjoy it. I probably only keep 25-40 gills in a whole season, so my impact is virtually nothing.I do however support the new regulations. My concern is the fishery,period.  It all comes down to personal ethics. I have been to way too many resorts where there are slot sizes for walleye and pike. And guess what? When you go to the fish cleaning hut most of the carcasses left in the cleaning pail are NOT in the slot size. Do theses resorts try to figure out who was the culprit and not have them come back?  I would hope some do...but I would put my $$$ on betting most don't.  Personally I can't comprehend the greed/feeling of entitlement necessary to keep 300, so 500 is beyond ridiculous to me."
439428,solopaddler,2010-03-03 22:58:00,8605,"I'll say this, 300, 500 what difference does it make? Regardless of whether they're lowly panfish I can't wrap my head around such ridiculously large limits. Who for the love of God needs that many panfish?  The answer is no one. Unless of course you're subsidizing your trip by selling fish.  I don't care if the ecosystem is actually enhanced by such large scale removal of panfish. Bottom line it's wrong."
439431,Dara,2010-03-03 23:10:00,3052,500 fish?  Its called sportfishing...not substinance fishing.
439440,FishinNanna,2010-03-03 23:48:00,15,"Couple or three years ago, I was working at one of these resorts.  Some of the guests had walleye over the size limit.  Owner called MNR .. this was early in the week, when the folks would be there for a number of days yet .. and nobody ever came.  When the owner called again asking if and when a CO would come out .. answer was .. he's on holiday this week.  I was there .. saw it and heard it folks .. sad to say but 100% true.  This is why I say you cannot paint them all with the same brush.  And by the way .. that number of 500 was decided by a bunch of bioligists and scientists and mnr people and ofah ..!!!!!"
439444,FishinNanna,2010-03-03 23:52:00,15,"And Dara ... if these folks take home a few hundred fish .. it's enough for a fish fry for a family.  You'd be surprised how many one person can eat .. probably 3 - 6 fish per sitting per person, at least.  Do the math.  And are they taking them away from YOU and YOUR family .. hmm .. probably not.  If you're Canadian, you probably don't want them anyway ...."

Actually hearing it from all sides is refreshing...Sounds to me like 300's a pretty respectable number...never fished Rice so not to sure about it...really comes down to people want what they want and they all want money...I see the MNR taking a hit buy loss of out of country licenses...which by the sounds of it in your location must be substantial...I can see about the same hit to the towns people, my question is if the towns people say that the majority of the people do NOT take home anywhere near there limits, then wheres the problem...From what I understand is they just opened up to ice fishing which gave you the opportunity to be open 5 more months of the year???? Not a good deal??? Anyway can't wait to see how this one plays out...peaked my interests now"
439461,islander,2010-03-04 00:16:00,11,"After reading this thread again I had to comment on this one...  Ice fishing on Rice Lake was a huge success this winter, at least what I saw. Families were out there enjoying the fun and they caught some nice perch too. The crappie were harder to come by but some fishermen caught a few good sized ones at night. I heard of more than one ice-hut being moved because all they could catch were walleye, and one of my neighbours caught a 33"" walleye last weekend, he thought it was a carp at first!  Best of all when the season ended on Monday all the ice-huts on my part of the lake and over to Bewdley were gone, way to go!  But... Thousands of fishermen Michael? Not this year, dozens maybe, but no thousands.  However - if there was a winter walleye fishery...  Have fun out there!  Islander"
437846,Whopper,2010-02-27 19:08:00,2174," Thanks for that comment   Not going to open a can of worms here but I have visited Rice Lake for over thirty-five years let alone a few other places in Ontario, met thousands of people and not one time have I ever heard of a person from the states coming up to harvest fish to sell here, not going to say it has never happened but I never heard of it before. Now I'll tell ya what I have witnessed, locals to cheap to rent a boat from a resort for the day and will pay a ""minimal fee"" to park their car and some dock space to catch buckets of panfish, some not more than a couple inches long, I say nothing until they feel free to jump on the deck on my moored boat to do what ever.  Again the biggest reasons Rick posted above is what are keeping people from coming up to your fine country."
437851,Michael_Brown,2010-02-27 19:34:00,411,"Don't misunderstand this issue. It is not a non-resident angler problem or a local angler problem. We appreciate people travelling here to enjoy this fishery. There is enough for everyone to enjoy, if we manage it responsibly. The people that are abusing this fishery need to be stopped. It is not a large group of anglers causing this problem but on a lake that sustains more angling effort than the rest of the kawartha's combined, it is an issue.  Quite frankly, if your business cannot adapt to supporting a healthy fishery maybe you should start targeting other groups to fill your cottages."
437868,Whopper,2010-02-27 20:33:00,2174," Exactly I agree  As far as the state of Rice Lake in particular I have a couple friends that have been going there long before I even heard of the place and they made three trips this past year, they are bass anglers and they said except for the smallmouth the catching was as good as it has been in quite a few years, they were happy. One of them even made the comment how many walleyes he caught this year not targeting them."

438015,troutologist,2010-02-28 04:33:00,951,"Here is my rant on the issue.  The RLCA group are a very short sighted, misinformed (unintentionally or by choice) group.  To try to lobby for something like this is laughable.  For lack of a better term, the fish are ""property"" of the crown, hence are to be enjoyed (legally and responsibly) by all licensed residents, non residents etc.  Fisheries should not be managed for the benefit of one vocal group.  What if another party opened a diving business on the lake who's attraction was underwater sunfish viewing. Could they not then lobby for limits to be reduced to 200 or dare I suggest 50??  I sincerely hope MNR and concerned individuals do not give in to this.  A lobby group that gets vocal for NIMBY reasons with nothing but personal interest should not drive this issue.  Cheers to you folks that are attending and giving your time and resources to stand up to this group."
438016,crappieperchhunter,2010-02-28 04:34:00,2582," I am not a MNR scientist either. But I fish the Kawarth'a for pannies April through September. Bluegills are actually the only fish I harvest from there during the summer months because to me they taste the best.  I'm assuming you either don't fish gills in the Kawartha's at all or at least very limited, because if you did you would surely notice the changes Sinker has eluded to...cause I most certainly have.  It really ruffles my feather's when someone who really doesn't have a clue sides with someone ELSE who really doesn't have a clue either.  I can't say whether these new fishing opportunities will be good/bad or have no affect at all. But I would think that a lot of sweat and hard work has taken place to bring these opportunities to all of us. Seems to me any conservation minded fisherman would understand and support that."

The resorts in question want a zero limit policy so they can cater to people (be they Canadian or American) who want to take large amouts of fish home, when the MNR has decided that is detrimental.   Seriously 300 sunfish + 50 perch, plus some crappie, add 4 walleye to that and even bass if you really must.  I really don't see the need to increase anything.  Further I guide in northern Ontario and I cook a shore lunch on every outing for my guests.  I practice what I preach and only enough fish if kept to feed a group. Some resorts on LOTW have even started offering cheaper rates to guests who practice catch and release.  They can eat some fish everyday, but don't take any home.  My guests feel good at the end of the trip that they did their part to help sustain a fishery for furure generations.  I encourage my guests to release trophies and the smiles in their photos shows how proud they are that they did.  As for cheap locals... I pay taxes here and I have my whole life.  I buy gas here, i go out to eat here, i shop at local bait shops, do i need to go on?  I respect my home lake and I insist VISITORS do as well."

I have a family member who told me last night regarding Rice Lake [EDIT to make long story short]  ""The sunfish are smaller. They used to be massive""  The average size of sunfish in Rice Lake have gotten smaller. Point conceded."

438686,Rice Laker,2010-03-01 20:51:00,24,"As a small cottage resort owner on Rice Lake, I would like to add a few comments to some of the posters: Michael Brown wrote “It is time for the anglers of the area to step up and let our local politicians know how important our sport is to the tourism of the area.” Agreed, but how much do local and GTA area anglers contribute to tourism on Rice Lake? Most drive up in the morning and drive home in the evening? Have any of you ever rented a Rice Lake cottage? “In fact it was shown that Rice Lake in particular was showing signs of stress due to over-harvest of the larger fish.” “There is no question the lake has a good population of sunfish but the need to protect the fishery from overharvest of the larger members of the population is important.”Strongly agree, that is why 5 years ago the RLTA, with the MNR’s assistance, started a voluntary “throw back the big ones” campaign. It has started to work. There IS a shortage of large bluegills, so why do the new Regs allow 30 of any size. For sure, these will be big ones, the exact opposite of what the lake needs. The Reg implies that bluegills are a less important fish. There is a new size limit on walleye, why not on bluegills? The FMZ 17 council recommended a quantity limit of 500 and ZERO over 7"". This would have been a much better solution to the problem and the majority of the US guests would still keep coming.  “Quite frankly, if your business cannot adapt to supporting a healthy fishery maybe you should start targeting other groups to fill your cottages.” A very good point!  What would you suggest, I am open to suggestions. BTW, don’t suggest carp anglers from Europe, this has been tried before with negligble results. I am considering promoting walleye; rent a cottage for a week, catch 4 and eat them, catch 4 and eat them, catch 4 and eat them............. What do you think?  Roy wrote: “I can think of a hundred ways to make their business opportunities more palatable for them and their guests” Great, I’ll keep checking back for the 100 suggestions.  MuskyGreenHorn wrote: “he fishes rice a ton and he lives nearby in elizabethville. She then tried to ask him to come stay and enjoy the resorts and talk about how great the area is. He had to laugh, he said ""lady, i am 10 mins from rice lake, why would i stay at a resort."" I guess she knows the area really well eh.....” Exactly, locals contribute nothing to tourism on the lake.  “How can something they most likely don't even know about stop them from coming, unless the resorts are informing them (which we know the aren't) then how could he vast majority even know about this?” This is not correct, of course any responsible resort will have advised the 2010 guests of the new regulations. This is how we know that there are many cancellations for 2010.  Cram wrote “Maybe its me, but i wouldn't drive 3 mins away to catch a sunfish. And some people come in from the US to do it?” A good example of how little locals know about the bluegill fishery on Rice Lake. BTW, 45 years ago it was the MNR strongly encouraging the Rice Lake resorts to attract US bluegill anglers to prevent overpopulation. I have owned my resort for 12 years and in that time I have had TWO Ontario residents stay and catch bluegills. Other resorts would report similar low numbers. Canadians do NOT target bluegills.  Rick O’Banion wrote: “The US is in a recession, their dollar has plummeted and most do not have passports.” Strongly agree and you should add the cost of gas to get here as well. These are things that cannot be controlled and are why there are 50% FEWER US anglers coming to Rice Lake over the last 5 years. MNR figures show that the number of bluegills caught between 2004 and 2008 dropped by 340,000 (I guess that this means there are at least 340,000 MORE bluegills in the lake than there would have been if the number of anglers remained constant). Also, the 2008 catch number was the LOWEST in 25 years. As has been said earlier, the quantity is not the problem, there are millions in Rice Lake.  CrappiePerchhunter “It really ruffles my feather's when someone who really doesn't have a clue sides with someone ELSE who really doesn't have a clue either”. I know exactly how you feel.................  2 final comments, please don’t make us out to be money grabbing people with no consideration for the health of the lake. I would think it would be obvious that no one has MORE interest in healthy fisheries than those of us with businesses on the lake. ZERO FISH =ZERO BUSINESS. In 2004 Rice Lake issuers sold $307,766 of licences to US anglers, in 2008 this had dropped to $161,726. This $146,040 difference would probably cover the cost of one more Conservation Officer for the area, so we are ALL losing........  My apologies for making this response so long."

438784,Michael_Brown,2010-03-02 01:23:00,411,"I would like to respond. I will use the same format.  ""Exactly, locals contribute nothing to tourism on the lake."" Really? So the tens of thousands of local anglers who fish Rice Lake every year contribute nothing to the economy? I think what you mean is they don't book a cottage therefore you don't care. In fact I would confidently say they contribute far more than the non-resident anglers but I do appreciate the contributions of both groups. Here is a quote from a recent STATS Canada article; ""In terms of direct expenditures, resident anglers spent over $1.6 billion on recreational fishing in 2005 (Table 2). Three quarters of these expenditures were spent on food, lodging and transportation costs. Less than 10% of the direct expenditures were for actual fishing supplies."" Still think we contribute nothing?   ""Strongly agree, that is why 5 years ago the RLTA, with the MNR's assistance, started a voluntary ""throw back the big ones"" campaign. It has started to work.

I also have been looking into the non-resident angler responses and the majority are upset with the 7 inch size limit. The 300 number is a concession to the tourist operators and now you are complaining because it is not more. Only 10% percent of the non-residents coming to Rice lake are taking more than 300 home and some of those are taking several thousand. Your clients are leaving to go to other area lakes where they can find larger sunfish. Regardless of what lake they are on the cottage rental owners that have been allowing that kind of abuse to take place in there resorts should be ashamed of themselves.  What would you suggest, I am open to suggestions. BTW, don’t suggest carp anglers from Europe, this has been tried before with negligble results. I am considering promoting walleye; rent a cottage for a week, catch 4 and eat them, catch 4 and eat them, catch 4 and eat them............. What do you think? Nice attitude but as long as the 4 walleye are inside the slot limit, it is legal. How about embracing the new winter angling oppourtunities. Those thousands of local anglers out there enjoying themselves this winter on Rice Lake, besides adding lots of dollars into the local economy during a slow period, are potential clients or at least a glimpse of the potential. How about a advertising campaign inviting your US guest to come and enjoy the best panfish lake in Ontario during the winter. Lake Simcoe operators are doing well with US clients during the winter months. Unless the RLTA is against ice fishing? Depending on what article you read some like yourself are in favour of it others have been doing a lot of complaining about it.  A good example of how little locals know about the bluegill fishery on Rice Lake. BTW, 45 years ago it was the MNR strongly encouraging the Rice Lake resorts to attract US bluegill anglers to prevent overpopulation. I have owned my resort for 12 years and in that time I have had TWO Ontario residents stay and catch bluegills. Other resorts would report similar low numbers. Canadians do NOT target bluegills. This is interesting. So you would like to use 45 year old data suggesting keeping as many as possible. If you wipe them out, you will have no business. The practices that have been allowed to take place has damaged the resource. Instead of fear mongering and complaining that the about the MNR....maybe you should look in the mirror and ask yourself just who is responsible for this abuse of the lake resources. Like you said, Canadians do NOT target bluegills and the glutanous persons causing this problem are not staying at my house!  Also a quote from the recent article:  ""During the Zone 17 advisory council meetings before the Jan. 1 change, no information ever suggested that ""sustain-ability of the sunfish population"" required limits, Brough wrote.  I disagree with this statement. We sat through hours and hours of meetings and read numerous reports and heard presentations from sunfish experts from all over North America. To ensure a quality fishery and a healthly population of sunfish, limits were absolutely suggested as an option. The RLTA represents it's own interests only. If you don't want to look like money grabbing people with no consideration for the health of the lake, then start acting like responsible resort owners who understand that a healthly well-managed fishery benefits everyone now and in the future. The non-resident anglers will come to enjoy the experience and the quality of a great fishery, harvest is secondary.  This arguing will do nothing to enhance our tourism but if the RLTA wants to continue to present false information to municipal councils and local media, I and other like me, will be there defending the rights of local anglers and our fishery resource. Anyone who wants to join me....I take two milk in my coffee.   Rice Lake is a fanastic fishery, there is enough for everyone to enjoy if we manage it properly."
438799,bigfish1965,2010-03-02 01:59:00,3382,"There are 50% fewer Americans going to EVERY resort. Its not just yours. I have worked in tourism for 30 years. We changed our marketing tactics to match the new reality and are still doing quite well, all things considered. We worked hard on a new client base. Our American customers were once 80% of our business, they are now 20%. You say the 2008 catch numbers are way down. 2008 was prior to the drop in the dollar and change in passport laws, so perhaps the bluegill population is stressed. In either event, you have not offered anything other than empirical evidence and hearsay. All the Northern Ontario resorts have learned to sell the EXPERIENCE not the number of walleye filets you can take home (once the walleye limits were cut). There are significant flaws in your marketing strategy and very few, if any, in the MNR's conservation plan. 35,000 people come to this site daily to talk about fishing in Ontario. I can tell you the number of American viewers have dropped from about 60% to about 40 %, yet our numbers overall are way up. Your new reality is that Rice Lake cannot sustain year round fishing pressure with no checks in place. Adapt to it. I know one resort whose business is way up in the last five years and their lake has lower limits and slot limits even on pike. I will let you put two and two together yourself. Allowing the Kawarthas to become a meat farm is not the answer. Our obligation to the next generation usurps all other considerations. Opening the lakes to ice fishing was meant as a way to reduce panfish numbers, not eradicate them. Limits (which very few anglers have found unreasonable) are meant to ensure that an unexpected massive ice fishing push doesn't harm the lakes. You will likely find that the MNR does not bow to monetary arguments. Perhaps you would be better off looking at the science behind the decisions made and refuting them, if you can, with some type of independant study."

It tics me off that people shrug off so many crappy laws if they are not directly affected but expect support from everybody when something comes along that they finally personally care about.

Larger  males  are  also considered more effective nest defenders. The presence of large parental males results in increased prematuration body size of sunfish and maintains the quality size structure of the population.

The end  result  is  a  shift  in  the  population  structure  and  a  decreased  abundance  of large parental males. Sunfish in these populations may be abundant, but offer a low-quality fishery.

I still wonder if people do keep bluegill and take them to the States, how they know that 30 are over 7 inches compared to the other smaller ones that people would bring back.  I still disagree opening ice fishing on Rice Lake.   The perch fishery has to come back a lot more than it is now, before ice fishing should even be allowed.  I know that I am in the minority on this topic though."

Im not sure what resort you own but by your comments it is obvious that you probably don't cater to other needs then cottage rentals.  I have a cottage on the lake and I can honestly say that I support many of the resorts in a huge way. I purchase gas for my boat and jetski from there, I go over and buy burgers, fries, drinks, candy, ice cream, worms etc when I am out on the lake and I go to another one of the finer resorts for dinner by boat. I participate in some of the local tournaments they put on, I go over and support them by paying for fish fry dinners they put on.  I probably contribute a hell of a lot more then most of your tourists put together. Maybe you should vamp up your resort or branch out and offer other amenities.  It is clear you just want to line your pocket. There is no guarentee that reverting the limits back will mean full occupancy for you!  Dirk"

SWISHMICK suggested for the best information look at:  http://www.mnr.gov.on.ca/264321.pdf Check page 19, it says “Black crappie and bluegill are not native to lakes within FMZ 17, but have become well established. These populations are now considered naturalized and it is unrealistic to expect a significant reduction in these populations at current levels of angler harvest”. So, if there are far fewer anglers out there, won’t the population increase ?  Rice Lake is a fantastic fishery, there is enough for everyone to enjoy if we manage it properly. Completely agree, it has been for many years even when many more bluegills were being caught than there are today. As the MNR has reported many times, Rice Lake is the most productive lake in Ontario.  One comment to DIGGYJ, if you have a cottage on Rice, you are not a tourist, you are a resident just like the rest of us who live on the lake, pay property taxes and support local businesses."
438976,Dara,2010-03-02 20:07:00,3052,"Why should I have to contribute to the bussinesses parked around a lake to fish it. They are just there to make a buck, and I am just there to fish. I am a resident and I pay taxes, what more contribution should I have to make to play on public property. And why should anybody living on a lake have special preference as to what goes on there as opposed to any other resident of Ontario. They don't own the lake."

So, if there are far fewer anglers out there, won't the population increase ?    You must think if we stopped all fishing for bluegill in Rice Lake that they would start overflowing the banks. If we did not harvest a single fish from Rice, guess what the populations will find a sustainable level and balance. Harvest is only one factor in the fish population health in the lake. To think that you are doing the lake a favour by taking as many as you can catch is wrong.  Also ""it was the RLTA representative on the FMZ 17 Council that proposed the ZERO over 7"". I agree with this but the problem is that any child fishing off their dock who caught a sunfish larger than 7 inches would be breaking the law. These fish are responsible for helping to recruite new anglers that the entire industry/sport needs. This would have been unacceptable."

Their target market are the few anglers who were causing the problems by taking thousands of fish during their stay. This abusive group is exploiting the resource, period. One group of 30 or so members likes to put off that they represent all of Rice lakes interests. I tend to think that the tens of thousands of anglers who enjoy the fishery would have a better opinion.  I take offense to the comment about the sunfish limits were not discussed at the FMZ 17 meetings.

I guess she knows the area really well eh.....  Nice to see good old Ben spoke up and the paper got it right this time though."
437243,jonnybass,2010-02-26 09:16:00,346,"Based on the limited info in the article, I actually agree with her position if I understand it correctly. Why should there be any new limits on sunfish?  Is the sunfish fishery in any danger? Sweet Geeeeezzzzzzuss. People have gone mad I tell you."
437402,diggyj,2010-02-26 17:50:00,548,What was the limit before it was 300 for sport and 15 for conservation?
437422,Michael_Brown,2010-02-26 18:28:00,411,"There was not limit before. That was the problem, some abusive anglers were taking thousands of fish and nothing could be done to stop them. It was well known that every spring, anglers with were stopped at the borders with several thousand fish taken from Rice Lake. The unchecked harvest of sunfish has started to show damage to the size structure of population. In sunfish communities large males are very important to the population, not enough of them and the smaller males become sucessful spawners dedicate their energy to reproduction not growth. This causes the population to stunt. There is no question the lake has a good population of sunfish but the need to protect the fishery from overharvest of the larger members of the population is important. Most of the harvest is by non-resident anglers. Nobody is blaming all non-residents anglers but the need to stop the ones abusing the resource is very real. The RLCA blaming the panfish limits to the problems with their business is concerning. The increase in the Canadian dollar, price of gas, US Border security and numerous other factors are far more of an issue limiting their business. Maybe effort towards effective marketing would be a better idea instead of blaming their problems on the MNR. The simple fact that some of the RLCA members have based their business on catering to a small group of abusive anglers, should have all anglers upset. As a business owner they should be upset when someone staying at their resort is glutanous and harvests excessive panfish. It is also true that over the last few years clients from Rice Lake have been switching to other Kawartha area lakes due to the decrease in average size of the sunfish on Rice.  We need to protect our resource, to ensure it remains a top quality fishery for years to come."
437426,timmeh,2010-02-26 18:36:00,609," Exactly, and fortunately people are standing up to this resource abuse.  Who in their right mind would complain about a 300 fish limit? I mean seriously, how dang greedy are some people?"
437428,TJQ,2010-02-26 18:41:00,7806,RELEASE THE HOUNDS!!  
437432,cram,2010-02-26 18:57:00,1733,"Maybe its me, but i wouldn't drive 3 mins away to catch a sunfish.  And some people come in from the US to do it?  Yikes.  Let alone cleaning them???"
437451,bigfish1965,2010-02-26 19:34:00,3382,"Seriously..I want someone to tell me to my face that 300 fish just isn't enough,.... Some serious stupidity going on up there. The fish do not belong to the resort operators. They belong to everyone. The MNR doesn't just pick limits out of thin air.  I guess long term sustainability takes a back seat to a quick buck, huh?"
437463,Tom McCutcheon,2010-02-26 19:44:00,627,"Ron and Mike; I figure if I show up also, that will equal two voices  to the RLCA members one voice... I will be there....  Tom."
437475,jonnybass,2010-02-26 20:09:00,346,"Does anyone have an estimate of the number of sunfish in Rice Lake? Probably in the millions would be my guess.  So there are a handful of our brothers to the south who are taking occasional trips up here and taking a couple of thousand sunfish (which none of us up here really fish for anyway) - They are pumping money into our economy (during a recession), and we're gonna start imposing limits - on sunfish?  I say heck, come on up and go nuts on the sunfish! Drop a grand or 2 $ during your stay. The local businesses will thank you for it.  A few bad apples CANNOT destroy the sunfish fishery! (it feels weird even saying ""sunfish fishery""). It would take an army of thousands of people fishing night and day for years to fish 'em out. Even then, I would guess the sunfish population would bounce right back in a couple of years.  To me this is a non issue."
437484,bigfish1965,2010-02-26 20:26:00,3382," No disrespect, Johhny, but there is no way in hell the limit is in any way the reason there are less travellers. The US is in a recession, their dollar has plummeted and most do not have passports. I would have to go with the MNR's view of the population and sustainability over yours, sir."
437499,jonnybass,2010-02-26 20:53:00,346,"Rick, I didn't say that the limits were the cause of reduced tourism. The facts you pointed out definitely have a negative affect on tourism. No argument here. BUT, given that fact, why make it even less attractive for the American sunfish anglers to come up?  Granted, I'm not an MNR scientist, but come on, sunfish for all intents and purposes are a limitless resource in Ontario. If there was a nuclear war, everything would be wiped out except cockroaches and sunfish.  Moreover, sustainability is only part of the equation that must be considered. What about economic considerations? Furthermore, if there has been a sharp drop in the number of Americans who travel up here to strip us of our sunfish due to the factors you pointed out, then why at this point in time is this even on the table? This to me seems like a solution in need of a problem."
437502,Whopper,2010-02-26 20:55:00,2174," Yep not all people are bass pros, walleye hunters or muskie freaks. Alot of families travel to Rice because of the pan fishing.  The die hards will still come, the new limit won't stop them, it's enough  A lot of people come from Ohio to fish Rice and mostly because of rising cost and job losses they won't be able to return"
437540,BillM,2010-02-26 22:06:00,17367,The only thing this affects is the amount of fish they get to bring home.  They can each eat 300 per day if they want.  I don't see the big deal with the 300 fish limit..
437741,MuskyGreenHorn,2010-02-27 07:42:00,158,"Science takes part, not sides.  The timing of the new regs with the economical hard times is unfortunate, but the lake has no clue about that.  If the MNR feels that the regs need a change, they obviously have good cause.  Also, rememeber its the whole zone, not just Rice Lake that these regs apply to. These regs will ensure that fishery is sustainable over the long term.  Thats means buisness will be sustainable over the long term.  I am all for weeding out greedy buisness's that want to exploit a public resource for their own short term gain.  And besides these regs are brand new, most locals don't even know about them yet, nevermind our friends from south of the boarder. How can something they most likely don't even know about stop them from coming, unless the resorts are informing them (which we know the aren't) then how could he vast majority even know about this?  And lets say a family of 5 comes for a visit, they can each take 300 home, thats still 1500 fish.  I live 10 mins from rice lake and have had plenty of fish frys supplied by rice and bet i haven't taken 1500 from there in my whole life.  The association is being short sighted and greedy, shame on them.  Anyone who doesn't believe that people don't clean hundreds of panfish in a week I urge you to go to a resort at Rice Lake and see for yourself.   Sunfish are just as tasty as perch and crappie and easy to clean.  i could whip off 100 myslef in 30-40 mins no problem. And thats with a regular fillet knife and they use big drum style scalers and electric knives."
437742,Sinker,2010-02-27 07:51:00,8692,"The tourists will whine about the new limits, but they'll also whine about the small size of fish they catch when they do come up. You can't make everyone happy, all the time. Just wait a few years when rice is full of bull gills again. The fishery isn't the same as it used to be.......even for crappies..........they're just not there like they used to be. The lake gets  pounded.......not only by our southern friends.  S."
437782,lhousesoccer,2010-02-27 14:19:00,442,"Some US states, including New York and Vermont, allow anglers to sell panfish (bluegill, pumpkinseed, yellow and white perch, and black and white crappie) legally caught by hook and line.  There are ""commercial fish buyers"" all over the place, mostly operating out of baitshops, who buy them whole live weight (uncleaned, unfilleted), and the price is pretty high.  The price paid per pound is on a sliding scale, but perch and crappie go for over $2.00 US per pound for fish over 12 inches, and down to $1.30 or so a pound for the smaller ones.  Take 300 or 400 or 500 panfish to a commercial buyer (and these numbers can be caught easily in some fisheries in just a weekend) and that's quite a bit of beer money  These US fishermen will pay for their entire week's vacation with what they sell back in the States.  When you put a dollar value on a public resource, nothing good can come from it.  I can't stand it."
