455160,danbouck,2010-04-12 22:10:00,4380,Well my oldest son turned 4 today. I think I did a good job because he wants to go camping and fishing for his birthday   Hard to imagine that he starts school in 5 months.  This is when he was wishing we were trolling to Manatoulin   Out at Shades Mill fishing   First cast in the new boat   Conestogo Lake   Temagami   Carpin   Soon to be pro   While I was at work today he had a map out finding all the lakes he wants to camp and fish at this year!

455164,lew,2010-04-12 22:20:00,12766,Great stuff Dan !!!!
455173,Twocoda,2010-04-12 22:30:00,4130,"you have no one to blame but yourself...when he is 22 and ""borrows"" your fishing gear without your permission and you are going through your vest at the river wondering where all your stuff is...  cute kid ...too bad they wouldnt stay like that ...  time does fly tooooooo fast ..embrace these times they are priceless"
455175,Roy,2010-04-12 22:31:00,13728,"I'm impressed Dan. Very nice. Looking at pic #4, my kids have never had to worry about getting a crick in their neck from looking at me like that. Thanks for sharing."
455176,limeyangler,2010-04-12 22:32:00,5204,DAN...U DA MAN!  I can only hope my son wants to fish and camp like your boy....you did a great job there with the young 'un.  Thanks for sharing.  Simon

455210,MJL,2010-04-12 23:33:00,2427,Simply priceless Dan...Thanks for sharing
455249,Ron,2010-04-13 00:30:00,1683,"How time flies Dan.  Just think, a few more years and he will know more than you, then after that they go to collage and discover the true meaning of C.O.D. (Cash off Dad). Shortly afterwards they realize they aren't smarter than the ol man and then the sessoin starts all over again with grandkids. I know I left a few of the details out but I hope I got the important ones....  Cheers, Ron..."
455354,Radnine,2010-04-13 10:40:00,1538,"Thanks for posting that Dan. I am in the same boat (well actually, I'm in my boat) but it is neat to chronicle your kids lives through fishing pictures. Jim"
455385,DanD,2010-04-13 12:33:00,2223,"Yea thanks for the memories Dan; looking through your pictures brought back a ton of great memories for me, fishing with my son. He’s 23 now and graduating this year with his BA in engineering from, UOIT in Oshawa. Proud as hell of him but because he’s done school and starting out on his career; he may have to cancel out on our annual trip (15 years) to the West Arm or other places “up north”, due to a job here in London at General Dynamics. All I meant by telling you the above, is hang on to these times and never get to busy to keep him by your side; for as long as you can. If they’re having fun fishing or whatever with the old man; they’re learning from and they will never forget. The tough part is that those times slowly become harder to find; when their lives begin to get busy and you have to let go.  And like Roy said bend down, so the little guy can see what you’re doing; one day you may have to look up at him. LOL  Dan."
455418,rock34,2010-04-13 13:42:00,215,This is great Dan!  He looks like a big time fisherman in the making.  My daughter is 12 weeks old today (finally qualifies for the Jolly Jumper   ).  I cant wait until I can get her out with me chasing down some pan fish!
455698,Rattletrap2,2010-04-14 02:04:00,1652,Congrats Dan! Looks like you are doing a fine job of raising a future fishing buddy. well done!
455806,JohnF,2010-04-14 12:54:00,3494,"Dan, you have no idea. Wait till he's 34 and 6'5"" sitting across the desk from you sharing his views on the direction the company should be moving. Jeez. I can still remember when I knew more than him.  JF"
