I was once asked by a woman in her 50's while fishing around the islands (she was on a dock drinking a wine spritzer at 8 am) if hurting fish made me feel like a man.  I do not think he meant Toronto people in general.   Lake of the Woods or Lac Seul for me.

454663,JohnF,2010-04-11 14:53:00,3494,As you get older the proximity to quality medical care starts to outweigh proximity to quality fishing. But there's lotsa nice fishing close to good medical services in our province so it will work out.  The other problem is that for some of us advancing years and the attendant frailties will preclude our favoured wading. I still really enjoy it but those durned rocks are getting slipperier every summer. I haven't been dunked in a long time but I've done some pretty impressive two steps to keep from a dunking.  I guess the best we can all hope for is to settle in a nice spot with a rocking chair mounted on a nice bassboat and a son or daughter or grandchild to do the messy work.  But that doesn't mean you youngsters can't have the fun of dreaming big dreams. There was a day I would have said a diveboat in a Caribbean marina would have been the ultimate retirement destination. Before that it would have been a country place with a motocross track and miles of trails to run with the sleds in the winter. Right now it's a cottage and a bassboat close to lots of quality bass fishing with some trout streams nearby where I can work on flyfishing. By the time my son lets me quit the business who knows if my soul and body will be in agreement on what we should do.  JF

My original plans for my retirement down the road had me moving to Smithers BC but after vacationing with my buddy Terry from Prince George and talking about living in BC, I found out it is just Ontario West and am rethinkng my retirement plans. The Yukon is looking pretty good. Great laker fishing plus rainbows, char, pike, salmon, grayling...... plus a fairly short trip for BC steelies and salmon and a days drive to South Central Alaska for some more awesome fishing."

We catch walleye, muskie, bass, carp, and all sorts of pan fish right off the dock and it isn't unheard of in the fall to take the 12 gauge down to the dock while fishing and come back up to the house with a goose or duck and a couple of nice walleye.  We are 10 minutes to town and a very good hospital (older people tend to consider things like that more) I can walk into the butcher shop, drug store,....... and people know my name. It is a beautiful rural community. There is plenty of work for those that want to work, property in the area is an excellent investment but there is still plenty of affordable housing for those just getting started.  I can be deer, turkey, or bird hunting in less than 5 minutes from my house, actually we often see deer and turkey close enough that we could shoot them right from our own yard.
