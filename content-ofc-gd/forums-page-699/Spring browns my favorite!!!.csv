455304,bucktail,2010-04-13 02:10:00,1857,"Spent a couple days over the last week chasing some spring browns around Lake O. Had to jump from port to port to keep on the green water and warm water, alot of runoff and wind has made it a fish as you go week but we ended up doing pretty good. Best lure was the good old Jr thunderstick in perch and Firetiger, it is my go to lure for spring browns especially in water less then 10 feet.  Most fish came of the boards with one good one coming on a flat line run right down the middle.  Manged to get my 2 freinds there first browns ever and myself a new personal best! This was great because I have been stuck on my old personal best for browns for about 9 years now!!  On with the fish pron!!!  Into one bright and early!    A fat spring brownie!!    Brett's Turn     Digging Deep!!    Brett's First     Jon's First!!!     This one is big boys!!     Finally a new personal best!!!  probabaly 15 pounds....scale is broke.      And to think it's still the second week in April  Later   Darren"
