I checked princess auto and they want $115 each with the rim and TSC and CT have just the tire for $100, I just need the tires. I'm hoping to find them cheaper than that somewhere.  Let me know if you know a place  Thanks, Dan"
456106,irishfield,2010-04-15 00:06:00,26272,Found some in Rhode Island for $30 !!
456108,danbouck,2010-04-15 00:07:00,4380, Can you get them for me
456109,irishfield,2010-04-15 00:13:00,26272,Best I found so far is in California.. on 5 bolt rims they are $70 each.. down to 60 or so with volume. $100 looks like a common price everywhere else..
