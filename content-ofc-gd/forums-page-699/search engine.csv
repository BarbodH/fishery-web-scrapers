Way to much time sifting through posts to make it worth while, I'm guessing thats why we see so many answered questions asked all the time.  Any answer to this...if you've never used it try and you'll see what I mean"
456329,chessy,2010-04-15 14:27:00,610,give us examples .... for instance in stead of saying    Recipefor walleye try walleye recipe   this will first narrow it down to walleye and then recipe  instead of recipe first . hope this helps  AGAIN its all in how you would word a search
456330,MJL,2010-04-15 14:33:00,2427,"You can try adding + (plus sign) in front of the words you are trying to search  For example, if I wanted to find posts about steelhead and spinners (both words) type in: +steelhead +spinners  I prefer to take the post preview off and go by looking at the topic names instead."
456345,tightline,2010-04-15 15:27:00,322,if you type in walleye recipe or reverse you will get every post that has the word walleye and or recipe...imagine how many post have the word walleye in it on here...  Going to try the +sign trick see if it improves...post preview off? maybe I missed that option...thanks
