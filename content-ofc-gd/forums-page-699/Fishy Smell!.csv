455013,s2k4mee,2010-04-12 14:16:00,73,"The trunk of my van reeks of fish smell.  Worst than gulp alive.  Went smelting and threw some in a garbage bag, however there was a rip in it and fish slime got on the carpet.  Any of you have any suggestion on how to rid of this foul smell???"
455022,bassman87,2010-04-12 14:35:00,586,gasoline should cover up that smell real nice

Even though they were in a plastic bag, the reek was incredible once they liquified  I kept blaming the smell on my daughter"
455044,Roy,2010-04-12 16:03:00,13728,"I think your best shot at it would be pet stain remover because you need an enzymed based cleanser to remove animal matter, fecal matter and the like. A light spray then brush it in and rinse with clear water. Let me know how it works."
455045,BFSC Kevin,2010-04-12 16:04:00,1351, time for a new vehicle
455048,MJL,2010-04-12 16:18:00,2427,"As Roy mentioned, pet stain remover should get it out.  My friend had a similar problem except with salmon.  I can't help but think back to that Seinfeld episode..."
455050,s2k4mee,2010-04-12 16:31:00,73,thanks guys =) I will try the pet stain remover
455051,Sugarpacket,2010-04-12 16:31:00,82,dont forget the sulfer smell from lighting the match after
455063,Billy Bob,2010-04-12 17:07:00,5865,You need to kill the bacteria (that is what causes the smell) and that can be done with household BLEACH or this stuff.... http://www.tilex.com/mold-and-mildew-remover/ I don't know what else is in this stuff but it works even better than plain bleach.  Bob
455133,Jer,2010-04-12 20:23:00,1426,"If you have a Swish Clean-It store nearby...get a small bottle of Aromx 60, it will eliminate almost any foul odour."
455141,Big Cliff,2010-04-12 20:56:00,6899,"NokOut! Enzimes work well but oxidizers work even better and are 100% safe. This stuff even works on skunk. It actually nutrilizes the cause of the smell. It is even used in water purification. something died in Sue's car last year, the smell was horrid, we tried a bunch of different stuff, nothing lasted more than a day or two. Then we used this stuff, within a day the smell was gone and didn't come back. We always keep a bottle in the house. NokOut"
455180,pike slayer,2010-04-12 22:42:00,1177,"rag in the gas tank with a lighter, fixes the smell everytime"
455196,OhioFisherman,2010-04-12 23:13:00,6623,Well I better not go there?
455300,rbaquial,2010-04-13 02:02:00,968," LMAO!! I Don't know if that was INTENDED to be a joke, of if you were being serious! Nonetheless, I THOUGHT IT WAS HILARIOUS!!"

455399,s2k4mee,2010-04-13 13:05:00,73,going down the list  Pet stain remover = fail tilex = fail  lasted till the next day though...  maybe i just have to use more of it... but I'll try Aromx60 tonight then if that fails... on to NoxOut.  Sigh =(
455426,Hud,2010-04-13 14:16:00,140,try a pan (like a pie pan) of ground coffee.  (fresher the better)
455465,bigugli,2010-04-13 15:36:00,6138, I'll second that. Used to dump a kilo of ground coffee in the back of reefer trailers. Best way to mask the smell of fresh chicken flesh. Usually takes a few washes to sanitize you vehicle enough to get rid of the stink from any dead flesh.
455466,MooseMerch,2010-04-13 15:39:00,68,"Spray 9, works on almost anything"
455485,s2k4mee,2010-04-13 16:43:00,73,"Went to Swish Clean-It as recommended by Jer.  Explain the situation to a sales rep there and he told me to use this bio enzyme call Aromx 35.  He also guranteed the horrid stench will be gone!  If not, bring back the bottle and get a full refund!  That was music to my ears.  I'll report back tomorrow."
455543,Big Cliff,2010-04-13 19:24:00,6899,"You should have just tried the NokOut first, I did some marketing work for them a couple of years ago. it actually kills the bacteria that causes the smell and it is 100% safe to use even for people with alergies. We use to do a demo with amonia, spray the amonia on our hand, spray NokOut on it, let it dry for about 30 seconds and you could actually lick your hand. The amonia was nutralized and all traces of the odor were gone. (and no, I don't work for them) We use it to sanatise our counter tops, I use it in my live well in the boat, and it works wonders for killing odors when hunting. remove skunk odors from your dog, liter boxes, smelly shoes and sports gear. If you were closer, I'd give you some to try!"
455559,Jer,2010-04-13 20:26:00,1426,"  The 35 is good, but the 60 is even better. Thank you for shopping Swish, all of our products are always 100% gauranteed.  What store were you at?"
455570,TC1OZ,2010-04-13 21:01:00,987,Any of the leading foaming carpet cleaners (for your house) will do the trick.. Just leave them on till the foam is almost all fizzed into the carpet then scrub the crap out of it with a cloth!  Hopefully the swish stuff works for you.
455712,s2k4mee,2010-04-14 02:35:00,73,"I would have tried Nok Out, but the only problem is I would have to order it from the website.  It would have taken that much longer to rid the stench.  As for which store, I was at the Oakville one since I work near there."
