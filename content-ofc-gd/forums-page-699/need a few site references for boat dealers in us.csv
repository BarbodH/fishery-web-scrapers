454997,bow slayer,2010-04-12 13:49:00,1074,If any who could pass along a few links to sites in the US(preferably places close to southern ontario) of boat dealers it would be greatly appreciated. I am looking for a new or very lightly used outboard for my boat . I currently have a 40hp and looking to upgrade to a 60-75 hp. I would prefer an Evinrude mainly because thats what I have on right now but will consider all especially a Yammy. I would like to see if I could find a motor cheap enough  south than here to make it worth while. thanks.

455125,Harrison,2010-04-12 19:55:00,2202,Try walleyecentral.com too.  I have been looking for a while now for a Ranger 620 or 621 in good condition.  Good luck.
455301,ohhenrygsr,2010-04-13 02:02:00,947,A Rude or a Yammy are great choices.  One thing i did hear was if you buy a yammy from the states and it is registered in the States then the warranty is not valid in Canada.  Just double check that before you buy

455498,mpt,2010-04-13 17:07:00,158,In MI just 5 min. from the bridge from Windsor is Lochman's Hardware. They've been around for 50+ years and are very upfront and reliable. Not the cheepst in the short term but the long run.  http://www.lockemans.com/
