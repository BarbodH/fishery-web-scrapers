450164,Banger68,2010-03-31 00:40:00,157,"I made trip to a Starcraft dealer today. There isn't a model with the rear bench.   They have a model line called Starweld, but they are not available in Canada yet."
450170,Banger68,2010-03-31 00:46:00,157,"How comfortable have you guys/gals found the small jump seats (in Starcraft, Smokercraft, Tracker, ect) in rougher weather?"
450275,Guest nuker,2010-03-31 05:01:00,0,"i picked up a barely used 2004 princecraft super pro 186 with a 150 optimax (with under 50 hours on it!)for $23K last fall and i find it a great boat for fishing and recreation.  lots of room, windshield is a must. the ride feels solid.  this is my first boat.  the wife loves it.. when i'm not out fishing with it...  i checked out the other boats when i considered new.  i couldn't afford the princecraft new, that's for sure. and that's what i would have gone for.  it's a pretty heavy rig i guess.  i'm pulling it with a pick up and i'm not so sure i would feel good pulling/stopping that with a dodge caravan...  but i've seen people tow bigger with their vans so..."
450355,landry,2010-03-31 13:23:00,1005,buy in the states!!!!!! a barely used one will save you soooooo much money with the way our $ is now:) Landry
450544,Dutch,2010-03-31 23:43:00,831,"I agree with the previous poster - look hard in the states.  You can potentially saves thousands and thousands of dollars.  If you are intent on staying in Canada, give Hastings Marine a try - they had some really good deals on some new, non-current Sylvan boats in th 16-18 foot range."
450615,anglerspro,2010-04-01 02:10:00,25,"Look into Alumacraft or Lunds. They're solid aluminum boats, you get what you pay for. Bay City Marine in Hamilton has always provided me and friends with the best prices and good service on those brands, They also sell Sylvan boats (I think).  I would'nt buy a Legend if you paid me.. Sorry Legend boat guys, I'm sure there's a few good Legend boats, but I've just heard way to many horror stories."
450836,hirk,2010-04-01 21:51:00,571,"I agree with Graham 100%.When it comes to aluminum boats if it doesn't say Allumacraft or Lund on the side I've seen enough,they are the 2 best built bar non and for me anyway quality is 1st priority.if it's not really well made the rest doesn't matter."
450840,irishfield,2010-04-01 22:00:00,26272,"Well as a, THE top of the line, Lund owner... I'm gonna state that the lads at the Princecraft facility can rivet a boat together just as good as their cousins at the Lund factory and there's not a big difference in the hull designs. Interior finish yes.. but what matters.. NO. Grumman made some good aluminum boats as well. Had a 20 year old one in the shop last spring for a few loose rivets and a small crack. Not a big deal after pounding Lake O all it's life. C(t)rackers... don't get me going there.. lol. Just ask Walleyemen how that's going for him with a pretty much new boat..."
452069,Banger68,2010-04-05 15:27:00,157,Thanks everybody for your opinions/comments. I decided on the Sylvan Expedition Sport 1800DC. Admittedly there are other boats out there that are better fishing boats but the Sylvan seemed to offer the best balance between fishing and sport/cruise.  I'll put up a couple pictures when I pick it up.
455428,anders,2010-04-13 14:30:00,1168,Right on...that looks like a sweet ride!  Im sure you love it
455532,fish_fishburn,2010-04-13 18:52:00,1311,Two of my buddies just sold there Smokercrafts because of rivet problems. The dealer would repair them and they would start leaking somewhere else. They are only going on three years old. Sylvan are made by Smokercraft so your call there. I had issues with Princecraft 20 yrs ago honouring there warranty but there boats are much better now. My brother has a Pro 166 I think it is and he really likes it. Tracker are junk as far as my buddies say who have owned them. I would seriously look at Lund if I were buying a new aluminum. They must make a fish/ski model. Expect to dig deeper in your pockets though if you want a Lund. Tough decision.
455760,white007,2010-04-14 06:26:00,16,"When buying your first boat i would suggest something used, there are alot of good deals out there u just have to do your homework, the economy is not the greatest and people will always get rid of there boat first. Not only that, as much as u think u might no boats whenfinally get yours there are so many expenses and things that go wrong that there is nothing wrong with experience before u get that baby u want"
455920,Banger68,2010-04-14 17:36:00,157,This is not my 1st boat. It's my 1st new boat.  I did some looking around for used but I didn't find what I was looking for or the price difference between the used and new didn't make it worthwhile. I admit that I didn't beat the bushes real hard though.
448139,Banger68,2010-03-25 22:04:00,157,"After a couple years of looking I think I'm finally going live a dream of mine to buy my first new boat.    I'd like to get opinions/discussion on a few things.  This will not be just a fishing boat but also a family boat (skiing, tubing, and cruising) I boat in Lake Erie (bit in Lake Ontario, and Huron), the Kawarthas, and in some small lakes up on the Bruce Pen. So I've decided that 17'-18', full windshield, and rear folding bench are some of the main options that I need. I've think I've narrowed it down to three.  Sylvan Explorer Sport Legend 18 Xcalibur Princecraft Super Sport  Anybody have experience/own these?  For the next while I will be towing with a minivan, and is one of the reasons I’m staying with an aluminum boat. It has the tow package and the boats are well within its tow rating. Anybody have problems at launch ramps with FWD with this kind of weight?  I’m planning on getting a 115 hp Optimax or E-Tec. That should give me plenty power for a day out fishing or water sports. Anybody have experience on maintaining these engines? I keep getting conflicting reports on what has to been done for each brand.  Welcome any experience/opinions. This is a big deal for me and I do not want to get something I regret in a couple years.  Thanks Bill"
448143,danbouck,2010-03-25 22:08:00,4380,Can't go wrong with any of those choices. I have a Legend and love it.
448145,skeeter,2010-03-25 22:20:00,1907,"as for the front wheel drive on the launches----no problem i had a 17'skeeter bass boat with a 150 on it and i have a 25'chriscraft deep V hull with a 15o on it and i never have a problem with my mini van-fwd only.  as for the boat my choice would be an 18' V hull bow rider. theres more room for the family with the open bow. full windshield with a camper top on it so you can get up and walk around.  as for the motor there both good motors, just make sure you dont under power it. if its rated for 140 dont go below 115. a lot of dealers will advertise a boat thats rated for a 140 but put a 50 or 75 on it to keep the price low to attract the buyers."
448146,Terry,2010-03-25 22:20:00,14456,Of the 3 Princecraft Super Sport hands down
448157,BFSC Kevin,2010-03-25 22:43:00,1351,Not much advise from me but grats on getting a new boat!
448176,Banger68,2010-03-25 23:12:00,157, All three are bow riders that convert into fishing platforms. I've been trying to make sure I don't fall into the underpower trap. But the next step up from 115 seems to be a $$$ one.
448180,Banger68,2010-03-25 23:15:00,157, I agree that it appears to be the better finished boat. But the 17' doesn't have proper rod storage which I found odd. But is it $3k-$4k better? Not sure. Do you own one?
448181,Banger68,2010-03-25 23:17:00,157," Thanks, but it isn't in the driveway yet."
448223,archer379,2010-03-26 00:09:00,277,i have a 1750 fish hawk crestliner and a 2002 carvan i don't know how much i would trust it in a wet boat launch pulls it fine. I went to a lake with a low slope launch gravel was flying when i pulled out
448230,Jer,2010-03-26 00:21:00,1426,"I towed and launched various similiar sized boats for years with a mini-van. I never really had a problem (excepting the first time I launched at the rough ramp at the end of my road, that required a tow-truck), but after 9 years now with a 4x4 pick-up, I wouldn't want to use anything else anymore. Nothing worse than arriving at a rougher looking ramp than expected and having to wonder..."
448265,lookinforwalleye,2010-03-26 01:21:00,4399,Mini-van no problem they will tow anything just ask any mini van owner!!LOL  Good luck with the new rig!!
448315,anders,2010-03-26 03:10:00,1168,"I too have been in the market for boats, and my wife has given the go ahead, just research.  Look at the alumacraft trophy 185 or the 195, truly an awsome boat.  I have my sights on the 195 trophy.  The legend is nice and deep and has me looking as well."
448325,archie_james_c,2010-03-26 03:33:00,618,You're up into the high end boats   .  Check out the Strato's 476SF fish n ski. Very nice fibreglass boats and very fair prices!!  http://www.stratosbo...ro.cfm?mid=5564  Otherwise I'd say the Princecraft hands down...that thing is luxxxury in a nutshell!
448331,Banger68,2010-03-26 03:51:00,157," I've been comparing for a couple years now. It's hard to find a boat that does all well. Tough to get a balance, The Alumacraft do not suit the non-fishing mode as well as the boats I mentioned. The Sylvan, Legend, and the Princecraft are all very close in dimensions. Have a look."
448386,smally21,2010-03-26 12:52:00,993,"have to add the stratos excursion series.  fiberglass boats that way nothing, couldn't hurt to check the website.  dt powersports in ontario sells them."
448509,cowanjo,2010-03-26 21:25:00,249,Awesome time for sure - have just done this myself and settled on a Proanger Xl from smokercraft (note thier deal was exceptional and got the price I demanded) - looked at all listed (not same model as i fish Kawartha lakes exclusively so I wanted a little smaller - I purchased through Port colbourne - Dan - can not say enough about them or the service on this boat or the last  Legend Boats we have Henry Nguyen on this site who works for them - great guy and will give you his best as well.  Good luck and post some pictures
448583,Banger68,2010-03-27 00:24:00,157, I have been talking to Dan at Port Colbourne on some of the Sylvans they have.
448594,Radnine,2010-03-27 00:44:00,1538,"  No, but I own a Crestliner and know that you won't be sorry if you look at one of these: http://www.crestliner.com/sport-angler-sport-fishing-boat-1750/ Good luck!! Jim"
448619,Dara,2010-03-27 01:39:00,3052,I bought a 16' explorer last year and am plenty happy with it but don't discount Starcraft. They make a heck of a nice boat. I would have been my first choice except it had to have a black motor
448980,Banger68,2010-03-28 01:20:00,157, I did look at Crestliner. But it like others doesn't convert to a cruise/watersport aswell as the three I mentioned. The Super Hawk was probably 4th on my list. They look like a real nice fishing boat though.
448995,Banger68,2010-03-28 01:49:00,157, I'll have to go have a look. they have a model that suits my need. Didn't notice it at the boat show.
449002,Pspoons,2010-03-28 02:30:00,4,Have you looked into a tracker targa 17?? great fishing family boat.. did a lot of research and i'm switching from a legend 16 to a targa 17 go online and check the specks before u make a deision!!
449012,fishhawk7,2010-03-28 03:14:00,7,"I have owned a Sylvan Pro select 19, for 15 years now and it has not given me one once of trouble, and I use this thing in Lake Ontario, Lake Erie and the Kawartha's and I can't say enough good things about this boat. Sylvan and Smoker Craft both come out of the same plant so quality is very comparable. As for towing, the best advice I can give you as a mechanic is to have a good quality transmission cooler mounted, and service the trans regularly as the transmission will be the weak link when towing comes into play. Good luck on your search and pick what boat gives you what you want for features and layout."
449168,Banger68,2010-03-28 19:14:00,157, I was looking at an 18 combo at Bass Pro on Sat. It has the little jump seats at the side instead of bench. All of these little seats were not well padded and probably uncomfy if it is a little rough. It did not have any enclosed rod storage (thought wass odd on a Tracker) and the sides were pretty wavvy where they were welded to the transom.  But they do have alot little touches that are nice and it come with 4 removable seats.
449171,Banger68,2010-03-28 19:19:00,157, My van has the tow package with the aux tranny and oil cooler. But I fully agree and would never tow without the tranny cooler.
