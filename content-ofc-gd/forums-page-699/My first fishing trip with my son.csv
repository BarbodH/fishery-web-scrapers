I decided to try him out fishing for the first time as the weather was windy but a decent 14C.  Headed down to a small local lake instead of out the front of the house for a change of scenery for both of us. Jack had a blast. I think he really loves being outside, and had an a great time as custodian of the minnows. he had his whole arm in the minnow bucket and was totally absorbed by the little creatures for the whole half hour we stayed. Got some priceless video and picture memories of our first fishing trip together.....just thought i'd share it with y'all.                                <object width=""425"" height=""344""><param name=""movie"" value="""
454917,EC1,2010-04-12 04:51:00,930,Nice! There probably isn't a better way to spend an afternoon than the way you did!
454921,Syn,2010-04-12 05:18:00,519,Yep I can tell he's going to grow up loving fishing and the outdoors. Great Job. You're a fine dad. Little boy had a fun day.   Tip: Make backup copies of the pics and videos. Data recovery for important pics is a PITA! Sister learned that the hard way.
