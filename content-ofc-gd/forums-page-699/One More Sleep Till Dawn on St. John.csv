Tomorrow is load and go to my new place on Lake St. John! I've already been working for a few hours today (got up at 4!) buttoning up what's left. Everything is changing this week, new home, radical changes in my tackle business (that happened just last night) so I guess that tomorrow really will be the first day of the rest of my life (ouch! I HATE old adages). Somehow I think the few hours sleep I got last night will have to do me for a while! Coffee break over -back to it!  Michael"
