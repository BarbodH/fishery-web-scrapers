While munching on one of those yummy harvest bars (the ones with the peanut butter in them) I saw a rather large hen steelhead hanging around, just beneath me, under a bridge.  It was almost as though the poor thing wanted a piece of my bar... She looked like she was begging, like she was soooo hungry   ...  So... I pulled out a couple of roe bags and...  bon appetit!    p.-"
455347,solopaddler,2010-04-13 05:10:00,8605,Doh! Paul you found Edna! The gouge on her back is an old rodeo injury.  I trained her to eat my roe bags!
455353,corvette1,2010-04-13 10:11:00,1765,could it be a lamp ray mark
455402,4thgen,2010-04-13 13:16:00,157,Awesome video. Good commentary too!

455484,MJL,2010-04-13 16:42:00,2427,I’m LMAO…The commentary is brilliant!!!    I’ve been watching it over and over during lunch. Fantastic video…Love it!
455515,l2p,2010-04-13 18:03:00,346,"thats awsome! reminds of last years opener well actually before but me and my buddy mike were scouting rivers to hit up after opener and came across a shallow run STACKED with fish, naturally we wanted to see if they would hit anything so first tried digging up a worm and tossed it in. man ive never seen a worm disappear so quickly in my life, we argued about how the worm just fell to the bottom so mike spts his gum out shapes it into a worm and throws it out there... not even a second before it hit the water a fish had already risen to take it as it was falling. such an awsome feeling."

455540,Paully,2010-04-13 19:13:00,712,Thats cool... Reminds me of another board member that had a pet muskie.

455624,MJL,2010-04-13 23:29:00,2427, I’m sure she’s thankful for that tasty treat She looks quite thin and needs some meat Without some rain the rivers won’t rise A significant factor towards her demise  It’s great to see you give a helping hand There are not many bugs crawling from the sand An incredible journey for a fish to make Hopefully soon she’ll be in the lake

455846,Paulus,2010-04-14 15:00:00,522," Nnnnice!   The Roe Bag Sonnet  Let me not to the catching of chrome fish Admit such poor judgment. Roe is not Roe That sits at home forgotten in a dish Or is chum for the chummers we may know. O no! It is an ever fresh/cured bait That looks on pools and is ne'er shaken. Prepared of various colour and weight, It glides in streams til it has been taken. Roe's not bass food, though Solopaddler's hooks Within their barbèd arch have caught a few But tempts again even the trout that spooks, When hordes of hungry rubes have all passed through.  If this be false, so that I've sinned: I never fished, nor no man ever 'pinned.    p.-"
455850,Paulus,2010-04-14 15:03:00,522, Doh! C.O. Phinney'd have had my posterior in the slammer if I'd done that. That fish was in a closed section of river. Hopefully she gets away before the opener  p.-
