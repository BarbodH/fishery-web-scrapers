I see areas where it looks like they bed down, and there is all kinds of fur on the ground. Some of it is the course back hair, but some of it is real soft and white like the chest fur.  Thanks"
455211,fish_fishburn,2010-04-12 23:34:00,1311,I think they are shedding there winter hair.  Saw a couple of does in my backyard today and they looked pretty scruffy.

455323,Rattletrap2,2010-04-13 02:44:00,1652," Thanks Guys. I thought they might shed just like dogs and other animals, but could not find much on this. Wayne, this hair might be okay for jigs, but the stuff you buy is usually tail hair and a bit longer."
455644,troutboy,2010-04-14 00:23:00,125,They're just loosing there winter coats.
