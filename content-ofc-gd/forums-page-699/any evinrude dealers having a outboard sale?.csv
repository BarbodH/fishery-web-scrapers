455320,bow slayer,2010-04-13 02:39:00,1074,"looking to upgrade to a larger outboard and would like to stick to a evinrude. I found a great deal on some new older stock Mercs 60hp but after all the changing of controls and rigging not such a great deal. So if an Evinrude dealer in your area has some great deals on 60-75 hp outboards please post dealer name and area,greatly appreciated. thanks"
