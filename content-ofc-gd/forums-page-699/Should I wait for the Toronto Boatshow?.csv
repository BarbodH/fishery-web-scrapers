455370,Jer_H,2010-04-13 11:47:00,25,"Hi all,  I am in the market for a new boat, and am wondering if it would be worth waiting until next year for the boat show.  Does the concentrated number of vendors result in competitive pricing, or would I be getting a better deal on a new '09 this time of year?  Any experiences you have had would be greatly appreciated.  (I'm presently looking at the Princecraft SS 172)  Thanks in advance,  Jeremy"
455371,Grimace,2010-04-13 11:51:00,2020,I think the best deals are in the fall when the in stock boats come off floor plan.
455372,Jer,2010-04-13 11:52:00,1426,You might save a few bucks by waiting...but how much is being on the water this year worth to you?
455375,John,2010-04-13 11:55:00,2956,"In my humble opinion you get more of the dealers attention and stand a better chance of a deal come late summer or early fall. The downside is that inventories are lower than they are now and you may need to compromise.  Personally, I hate trying to compete with tire kickers at shows. They are a great place to take a look-see and narrow down your selection but I wouldn't buy during all of that hype....  Welcome aboard by the way.  I have a Pro 174SS that I bought new in 2008. Shoot me a PM and I will give you some insight into the dealers that I shopped."
455382,Stoty,2010-04-13 12:26:00,2910,"Dude...speaking from personal experience....I say DONT waste your time at the boat show. I was in the same boat last year, and wow, the ""deals"" at the show.....were hardly that. Maybe I hit a bad year, or the recession was at fault, or whatever, but the best a guy could do on a brand new bass boat for me was $500 off. He wouldn't even throw in life-jackets either.  I agree with Grimace, the best deals are in the fall when people/places dont want to bother wasting money on storing boats over the winter."
455394,Harrison,2010-04-13 12:53:00,2202," Bingo!  As for the boat show, it is a great place to do research.  And sometimes a good deal could be made on a boat like you are looking for becasue there are a few of them around at different dealers.  Certain boats(i.e. bass boats) have somewhat limited inventory with alot less dealers representing them."
455413,Banger68,2010-04-13 13:34:00,157,"I got several quotes at the boat show. Then I went around to the dealers and they all beat that quote when they know I was also looking elsewhere.  There are a couple incentives from Mercury and Minn Kota that I got for my boat. You tend not to get these in the fall as much.  I was fairly picky about what I wanted (options, colours, ect) so I bought in the spring. If your not so picky might be able to swing a deal in the fall leftovers.  A few other thing to watch out for too. Interest rates will be going up this summer if you are getting a loan and there is a chance the US dollar going to start comimg back. That will drive up the price of anything that has to be ordered."
455420,Grimace,2010-04-13 14:05:00,2020,Good points Banger
455473,fish_fishburn,2010-04-13 16:17:00,1311,I would shop around for one that is 2 or 3 yrs old and lightly used. You could save a fair chunk of change rather than buying new.
455489,Jer_H,2010-04-13 16:47:00,25,"Thanks for all of the excellent information.  I've heard from several sources interest rates are on the way up.  I've considered buying used, but the boat I want is so specific that either I'm not looking in the right places, or there isn't any available in the used market.  Either way, once I make a decision on the 2-stroke vs 4-stroke dilemma I'm hoping to make a purchase!!  Jeremy"
455523,Banger68,2010-04-13 18:30:00,157,"Sounds like you are going through the exact process I just went through. The one thing I found odd about the Pricecraft was the lack of proper rod storage.  I decided on 2 stroke, but it took me awhile to decide."
455531,Roy,2010-04-13 18:49:00,13728, That model has 7' rod storage.
455535,Banger68,2010-04-13 18:55:00,157," There is a 7' compartment, but nothing to hold the rods."
