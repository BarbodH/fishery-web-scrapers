455079,MJL,2010-04-12 17:41:00,2427,"Where am I going, I don’t quite know Into the valley where the cold creek flows Is my boss cross because I didn’t show? Anywhere, anywhere, I don’t know    Drifting a float along a seam Floating a river of emerald green Flashes of chrome and silvery dreams Hoping a take from those unseen    The float pops under and line peels off the reel Torquing the rod for that one tight feel Gasping and sweating for a moment’s steal Thinking and mumbling, “this can’t be real”      Reality beckons and I’m tired and wet Excitement and relief, wipe off that sweat Into hand like a now tamed pet And back into water for freedom’s set    Friends amidst a flurry of fun Setting hooks and landing some            Hoping and praying for one last great run Leaving quickly when our misses rung…  Hope you enjoyed    P.S  Many thanks Jet and Ant for all the rides to the rivers on all those early spring mornings (and subsequent late nights) this season - Hard to ask for better fun. And Solopaddler for your never ending generous words of wisdom…Really appreciate it"
