455182,asdve23rveavwa,2010-04-12 22:50:00,2690,"This was actually the first fishing board I joined, and, just last year at that.  Never really bothered with any internet fishing info...now I don't know how I did without it, at times.  I have met some great guys, learned some awesome tips, shared some fishing experiences, got into a few arguments...but, it all boils down to sharing with others in the passion and sport of fishing. Good fishing and tight lines to all, no matter what species or type of angling you prefer!!!!"
455188,OhioFisherman,2010-04-12 23:00:00,6623,"Found this site while looking for information on the Moon River area back in 2002-2003? Illness prevented me from making that a realistic destination. I just thought that for the most part the people on the board and the way it was handled were great! Only met a couple in person, but consider a lot of them friends. Most would be welcome at my place."

455618,JohnF,2010-04-13 23:16:00,3494,I had such good luck learning slightly more than the basics about scuba diving from the net that when I took up fishing a few years ago I figgered the internet would be my tutor again. It worked. Not only did I find a place where I could get all the info a newby needs but I found a whole herd of good folks.  JF
455623,Daplumma,2010-04-13 23:24:00,1961,"Say what you like,Rick.I saw more than a few Canadians fall prey to a couple of slurps of good old fashioned southern white lightening. Joe"
455627,bigfish1965,2010-04-13 23:38:00,3382," Yeah, that stuff is nasty. Still have no taste on one side of my tongue!! Maybe someone will bring some screech if you are coming this year Joe."
454505,Mykester,2010-04-11 02:11:00,241,"I have learned a good amount of info on this site. It's also great to find a report on a body of water you are interested in checking out, as well has learning about new places."
454533,Twocoda,2010-04-11 02:43:00,4130,this site is a respectable front for the other sites i keep getting caught on
454579,SRT8 smoker craft,2010-04-11 09:52:00,1107,   Its to bad none of us could catch anything lol but we did look the part hope we do it again this year. As for the OP I have a problem its an addiction really if I can't go fishing atleast here I can read about it and occasionally see guys go postal on the net LOL (SF) this is a great site with a bunch of good guys for the most part hopefully I will actually be able to give a fishing report one day can't seem to get out lately I'm starting to have withdrawl.
454581,Big Cliff,2010-04-11 10:24:00,6899,"I first got started on this site about 10 years ago and they just won't kick me off 9lord knows I probably should have been a couple of times LOL).  I have made so many wonderful friends through this site (some I haven't even met in person yet) and if I even dare to suggest that I need help with anything there never seems to be a shortage of offers to help. A couple of years ago when I needed help to put my docks in 16 people showed up on the coldest windyest day in the spring and put the docks in for me. (I have since redesigined the docks so they are manageable with 2 people).    I love the way we can learn, laugh (and cry) together at times, rally around to help someone in need and just be there if the occasion warrents it. To me, it is more than just a website! Without OFC, I wouldn't have this:   This is family to me."
454586,wormdunker,2010-04-11 10:52:00,1711,"I love all of the info members are willing to share - fishing tactics, advise on equipment, locations, repairing one of my toys, which stores for equipment & the list goes on & on....  I like to do most of my work & thru this site I've had lots of info to help me thru a project. Right now I'm getting ready for perching on Lake Erie.  Hopefully my partner doesn't sleep in!!  Thanx to the members of OFC"
454594,splashhopper,2010-04-11 11:52:00,2931,"This site has been a great source of information and help to a newbie like myself and my daughter.  I have met some nice guys here and look forward to helping out with Ryan's fundraiser this year if it is a go as well.  Fished with spinnerbaitking, twocoda, dan Bouck, Ryan, Chris K,John F(and his friend) Jjcanoe and Dutchie so far and the guys at Ryans fundraiser that I just can't remember all the names   .( hope I didn't forget anyone)  My daughter and I are looking forward to a couple of the family fishing events this year that we see all the great pics and stories from as well.  Keep up the good works,  why would I even bother looking for another forum? Is there one?"

455140,aplumma,2010-04-12 20:53:00,6896,  So you wish to challenge me to a beer drinking contest??? O wait I don't drink often never mind. Hows about a game of roe sham boe instead?    Art
455142,Big Cliff,2010-04-12 20:59:00,6899,"What ever you do, don't challange Roy to a beer drinking contest, he'll sleep you into a stupor you'll never forget!"
454443,vinnimon,2010-04-10 23:30:00,2593,"Im only asking because, since I joined I met and fished with a few on board.Little did I know at the time how big this community really is.Its huge!I met many and chatted with plenty.A few little rants with others, but all in all good.I also noticed being a member and rambling on about OFC and all the good gents on board, the smiles and laughs are also bigger.Finding out later that they are also members as well. All in all what intrigues me is that OFC is a decent fishing community.BTW the Tyler Tourney showed me what kind of community this really is.Couldnt be better."

454453,cheaptackle,2010-04-10 23:45:00,849,"I actually was a ""lurker"" for a couple of years before finally joining.  I found it a great place to at least hear/read about fishing when I wasn't in a position to actually get out myself.  Now I find great information, true ""anglers"" practicing conservation as opposed to those who ""must"" catch.  Above all else is the wide spectrum of experiences related on here, something new to learn, hear or see every day.  It's a great place to be and actually have a ""mini vacation"" even if only for a few minutes, makes the rest of the day tolerable. There - I got the soppy part out of the way!  Back to the humour...  Michael"
454455,Rizzo,2010-04-10 23:48:00,4754,"definitely the community aspect, to me fishing is secondary. To be honest, rarely do i learn anything new about fishing here! But getting to know the people and sharing in their heartaches and happy times is what makes OFC special."
