Just got back from a nice getaway a la solo to San Diego to visit some cousins and go on a little soul searcing mission, you could say..  As usual, I strapped a pack rod to my backpack with the intention of finding any toothy critters willing to smack a jerk bait!!  As soon as I stepped into my pad I went-a walkabout to see if I could find some fishable water..  The beach where I stayed was mostly surfer friendly, with huge swells, rip tides and 55 degree waters.  But without a wet suit and a long board, no chance I wasn't gonna join in!  Didn't have to go too far..  There was this lagoon just up the street on Camino Del Mar that was just begging for a little bait dunkin.  Most fish were caught just as the high tide was starting to turn, on a little beat up LC B'Freeze.  As some of you might recall, I've caught everything from eyes to tarpon and cudas with this bait, so it's pretty much my go-to bait for prospecting the salt..  Good thing I was prudent with the license, cause I did get checked twice by cali fish and game.  I was also told that the halibut had to be at least 22in to keep.  All but one fish were shorts and had to be released, but talk about fun on light tackle!!  Feeeesshhh porn..     What adaptation?!!     Some even fell to twister tails..     I tried fishing the surf, but most of my luck was off the beach in current eddies and seams.  I checked out blue water tackle in Cardiff to splurge a little and pick the shop keep's brain, and was told that some halibut were being caught in the shallows, where they spawn.   Tons of smelts around too.  Saw this homeless dude chucking bread at em and eureekaed some on small hooks and dough.  Even caught enough for a meal!     Tasty feesh indeed-a-roonie!     Gotta dig the pebbled backdrop.     Even spotted this slimy monster..  It was over 2 feet in length.  Biggest sea slug I've ever seen!     Biggest fish of the trip.  Just shy of 23in.  Toiled a bit about wether or not to release her, and finally decided to have her join me for lunch!     One happy dude.     Just lookit dem cheeks and shmoochable lips.     P3TA mongers avert your gaze!     The finished product.     By far some of the best tablefare out there.  I decided against a complicated recipee, and opted to cook the filets in butter and olive oil, lightly seasoned with a little basil and parmesan..  OH. MY GAWD.  What a sweet place to visit..  Night life was insane of course and there was loads of great deals on everything, and the eats.. yah baby.   Even checked out Torrey Pines State Park to take in the scenery..        Torrey Pine.  Look familiar?!     Big juicy coleoptera.     And finally, a farewell sunset..     Hope you enjoyed,  cheers H-to-the-Dizzow"

455908,Dutchy,2010-04-14 17:11:00,416,"Yah, I fished in San Diego in December. Went out in a boat. All we caught were red snapper and scorpion fish. It was a blast though. Plan to go back in the summer some year to fish when the big tuna are around. Go down on one of the overnighter boats to Mexico.  Nice report. Where exactly were you fishing? North of SD towards La Jolla?"
455921,highdrifter,2010-04-14 17:42:00,2534, Thanks!  Yep. Bout half hour north of SAN.  Closest intersection was Camino Del Mar and 28th..  Google map it and you'll see the lagoon.  fishing is allowed up to Jimmy Durante blvd.
455924,johnnyb,2010-04-14 17:50:00,3413,More impressive stuff from H-the D....wow!!!!

455954,anders,2010-04-14 18:53:00,1168,mmmmmm...halibut....thanks for sharing
455970,Dutchy,2010-04-14 19:42:00,416," Thanks alot. I plan for sure to go back there so you have given me some ideas. We went out from Fishermans landing. The guy on the boat told us to come back in june/july, said it is non-stop, can catch smaller tuna and tons of big red snapper. I'd recommend fishing there to anyone."
455974,solopaddler,2010-04-14 19:47:00,8605,Very cool report and pic's Fidel.  Solo soul searching trip? Sound serious.  Whatever answer you were seeking I hope you found it.
455979,dannyboy,2010-04-14 19:57:00,367,"Great report, thanks for sharing.  Dan"
455985,highdrifter,2010-04-14 20:05:00,2534, Thanks budday.  Remember that night?  You could say that was the catalyst..  Nobody's fault but my own..  The trip certainly changed my ideas though.. the slate is getting cleaner.
455993,solopaddler,2010-04-14 20:18:00,8605, I was hoping that wasn't the case.  I think we need to get out fishing soon.
455996,highdrifter,2010-04-14 20:21:00,2534, Only once I'm mobile..  I'm tired of being flaky.
456012,laszlo,2010-04-14 21:04:00,487,Nicely done man. We need to catch up during our next mission. Bring on the camp out for opener!!!
456013,highdrifter,2010-04-14 21:07:00,2534, Brah that weekend couldn't arrive any sooner..  It's gonna be awesome!!
456079,buick14,2010-04-14 22:49:00,741,"Punky report bra....too much curado BSF in that for my liking though.. what set-up you destroying in salt?  hope your having fun, but mom says its just about time to come home now.."
456149,highdrifter,2010-04-15 01:23:00,2534, Just a little sf brah..  Behave!!
456152,Jigger,2010-04-15 01:29:00,1237, Tell that to the Halibut...  Nothing like a solo to get yer mind going. Hope alls well. Guess I'll get in line to wet a line. Later dood.
456163,ehg,2010-04-15 01:45:00,2666,Nice report there Fidel! The halibut must've been superb.
456191,highdrifter,2010-04-15 02:40:00,2534, HAHAH!  Very sharp dood.  Lemme know when you need a netter!
456192,highdrifter,2010-04-15 02:44:00,2534," Thanks Erik.  Nothing like halibut you've caught yourself.  There's a spot up the street that serves fish and chips, english style.  The halibut is flown in daily and still, i doesn't even come close to the one I cooked up.  Mind you, size does make a big difference."
