I ended up putting a micro swivel above my float and resorted to the side cast. (thanks for the tip BillM, worked out great)  A couple floats later and...

455462,Spiel,2010-04-13 15:34:00,9065,My memory sucks but I'd be willing to bet that's better than my first outing with a center pin reel.

455651,danbouck,2010-04-14 00:29:00,4380,Awesome!
455652,BillM,2010-04-14 00:30:00,17367,Good job man!!!  The swivel just helps you concentrate on casting instead of line twist

455873,FishTracker,2010-04-14 16:07:00,47,Nice fish man!  I should have talked pinning tips with you while we were in the fish ladder together on Sunday ;-).  I'm still waiting for my first steel on the pin!
455960,spinnerdoc,2010-04-14 19:11:00,556,good on you man i am in the same boat as you.started last fall steel heading. finally got my pin together and last sunday was the first time out with it.got skunked but not a bad day overall. workin on my wallis cast as well and like you not getting the distance i wanted...and btw i have swivels on but below the float though....  congrats again
456014,laszlo,2010-04-14 21:08:00,487, Thanks.  That wallis cast is tough. I have to keep at it. I have one swivel above the float and another below between my mono and flouro leader.
