925772,kickingfrog,2015-07-22 20:37:00,8333,  I have most of the usual removal tools but saw these and figured I'd seek some first hand feedback.
925773,AKRISONER,2015-07-22 20:39:00,5558,can someone even explain how the hell this works?
925776,leaf4,2015-07-22 20:51:00,2466,I would think you put it in the mouth then pull the bottom handle up or push the top one down to close a loop around the hook then you do the pushing to get it loosened
925778,misfish,2015-07-22 21:10:00,29133,"I would think you put it in the mouth then pull the bottom handle up or push the top one down to close a loop around the hook then you do the pushing to get it loosened  Winner  You get the hook around the hook, squeeze and remove the hook. I have seen these, but not sure how well they work Rob. What was the price? Might be worth a try. If they dont work, return it.  In my opinion, long handle needle nose pliers work 99.9% of the time."
925780,spincast,2015-07-22 21:27:00,3279,"I had one for a while - It seem to have gone  awol on one of my weekend away trips  . Works well once you get the hook in the groove, especially on deep hooked fish. I found it pulled the hookout cleanly."
925782,kickingfrog,2015-07-22 21:39:00,8333,"I see them as a deep hook out tool, but as such, I'd like them to be a little longer. The ones pictured are what I saw at Cabela's. Not sure if there are different lengths or brands out there."
925785,misfish,2015-07-22 21:52:00,29133,Something of the same  
925804,GBW,2015-07-23 01:22:00,8460,I see them used often on the shows that are filmed in the FLA area but not many other shows when I watch a fishing show.
