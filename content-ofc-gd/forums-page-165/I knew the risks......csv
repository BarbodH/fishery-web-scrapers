924961,Gerritt,2015-07-16 03:05:00,6129,"Well, day 12...... I can honestly say these have been the toughest 12 days I have ever had to endure... Today I was told I'm looking at another 3 weeks or more.....uhmmmmm I don't think so!!  So beside flirting with the nurses and other around the floor and spending time with visitors somehow I managed to get my therapy I'm there as well.... Two sessions 1 hour each session. The girls are awesome! And as much as they push me.... I push them as well.... They say we're done! I say no were Not one more!  Well I thought I pass this along, it took a ton of work to get to this point.... And still a lot of wo A head of me.... But it's one hell of a good start.  http://vid129.photobucket.com/albums/p224/gerritt_2006/Mobile%20Uploads/trim.9A385791-1005-4F2E-B8E4-B5A435A31D13.mp4  G"

924987,fishing n autograph,2015-07-16 11:49:00,2540,Get well buddy! Pay attention to the possible side affects of the stroke. My dad had one three years ago and he still has issues swallowing
924989,lew,2015-07-16 12:11:00,12766, But it's one hell of a good start.    Good to hear Gerritt and keep pushing.

925109,TennesseeGuy,2015-07-17 17:18:00,957,"Hey Gerritt, it's not going to be easy and it's going to take a while, but you seem to be a guy who will accept the challenge and be successful in your recovery.   Satisfying the PT folks and asking for more is a good road to travel.  Check Gunny's Rules, written by R. Lee Ermey.   You're probably already living must of what he writes.  Don't allow the disease to see you hurting.   Attack it and make it go away.   Don't miss a day, even after you're at home on your own.  You have a lot going for you."
925949,Gerritt,2015-07-24 00:40:00,6129,"What a difference time and hard work makes, 2-3 hours in the gym a day, combined with extensive exercises in my room have helped tremendously.  While I am still wheel chair bound for now, things have improved. I'm still shaky and lose my balance the odd time here and there, but even those things are improving. Hopefully I'll get back to 90% mobility or more. Still have lingering numbness in my thigh and the top of my foot.... If that's the worst of it I can deal with it. Here's an updated video taken today.  http://vid129.photobucket.com/albums/p224/gerritt_2006/Mobile%20Uploads/trim.8F4C2FCD-9DD4-4B30-9322-037AC18496CD.mp4  Now to tackle the stairs.....

923571,Gerritt,2015-07-06 23:33:00,6129,"Update:  Well I should have medical clearance tonight, just my fourth and hopefully final ctscan. My head is still a little fuzzy and the words I sometimes speak are not the ones I am thinking of.. That should clear up.  Physically I'm getting better. Still very weak on the right side and my sense of balance is shot due to that weakness. The brain needs to be trained to compensate I am told, tomorrow (should I get the medical clearance ) I go into rehab. Both PT and OT this could be as short as 1 more week in hospital to 2 months... It really all depends howy body and mind react. There will also be some help with my cognitive functions thrown in there for fun as well.  I am lucky I have a great team of doctors work on me when I arrived by ambulance I was rushed by over a dozen people videoconferenced to specialists in the Toronto. Each had a role to play. They determined not to use the tPI (clot blaster) on me because of my age (young for a stroke), it can only be used once in a persons lifetime, and abunance of caution, for one it can kill you.  They are happy with my progress so far, and hopefully fingers crossed I start Rehab tomorrow so I can get out of this damn wheelchair  Thanks all!  G"

It sounds like you have some great people on your team. It's a big hill to climb but you are young and strong. Just do it."

Use it to scare you straight and put down those smokes and fast food burgers.  I kicked the smokin thing years back but also need to start focusing on staying outta that fast food lane. Like you said, the realization that im not in my 20's anymore and the shock that im not invincible will help us thru it"
923758,Bernie,2015-07-07 21:08:00,3190,"Holy moly Gerritt! Sorry it happened to you. Glad you are doing OK.Wake up call time.

He had a few hurdles from then to now with his eyes and left side, but has fully recovered.  I'm sure you will too.  Now rest and take care of yourself.  Quit smoking and take it easy for awhile.  Please update us on your progress bud.  We're here for you!"

923370,bigugli,2015-07-05 19:29:00,6138,"You're typing a post. Like others have said, ""that's good""! When you get home take it real easy. 6 months to a year to fully recover.  Had an M.I. at 40. Was told to ""ditch the smokes or see you back on the slab in a month's time.""  It will make a huge difference as you recover. A neighbour my age had the stroke and was given the same advice. He didn't take heed and was gone 5 months later."

923385,woodenboater,2015-07-05 21:37:00,2277,"There are different types strokes and hopefully it was a TIA vs any of the other nasty ones. and whatever the doc says is probably golden so rest up, get better and you'll be back on the water before the hard water season begins. And you have everyone's support and encouragement if you need to adopt a lifestyle change. I'm sure many of us have had to give up some of our vices and fav foods but it can be done."

What did you go and do that for Gerritt?  Hang in there and listen to what they're telling you. I know that might be hard for you to do, but do it anyway okay! We need you back up and at'm soon!  Like Terry said, the best part is you made it to the hospital quickly and the fact you're online would suggest they got you in time!"

And now here I am holed up at Belleville general in their acute stroke ward  Seems I'm not as invinable as I thought!  Although none are ever too young for health problems like this, you're kinda too young ya know!?!  Sorry to hear this Gerritt.  You are as of stroke onset or shortly thereafter at your worst point.  You WILL greatly improve from this time forward, you WILL get strong and heal, and you WILL learn from this.  The fish God's are going to reward that BIG TIME when you're ready.  But for now, rest easy, listen to advice and take your medicine.  Get well dood!"
923403,Old Ironmaker,2015-07-06 00:28:00,8243,"Man not good. I have bad habits too and am playing Russian Roulette with my life. No where near as bad as I was 17 years ago when I was told I have Type 2 Diabetes and have improved 90% as far as lifestyle but 10%  bad can kill you I'm told. I know we are what we eat and drink. I do the best I can but am weak sometimes. Easy to say ""change your lifestyle"", much harder to do. Try is all I can say. Get better, many fish out there with your name on them. I had a close Uncle that wouldn't listen. I told him it was up to him if he wanted to see his Grand kids get married. He died watching Monday Night Football with a bowl of Buffalo Wing bones and a MT bottle on the table in front of him. He made his choice."

923425,Beans,2015-07-06 02:17:00,3339,All the best Gerritt...my old mum had a stroke at an early age (30's) and walked with a cane for the rest of her life now I use the same cane to get around...the cardiologist sez I had a minor stroke about three years ago and outfitted me with a pacemaker...  Early next month I go in for an electro cardio version to kick start my old ticker back to regular beating...  Marvelous what they can do nowadays...  Cheers!
923427,muddler,2015-07-06 02:25:00,623,"It's a warning not a sentence. That's what my neighbour says. He had a stroke 17 years ago and made ALL the life style changes that he had too. At 68 he still walks  a good 45 minutes every day (even at -30C). I know I go with him. His wife says we're nuts, but  healthy nuts.  All the best Gerrit. This is only the start of a new beginning. Lots of fish to catch yet."
923433,GBW,2015-07-06 02:46:00,8460,Oh man G I only have a few years on you too so I'm shocked! I hope for the best for you man! If needed I'll get that 'air horn' and get you back for last time too if that's what it takes to keep you around.
