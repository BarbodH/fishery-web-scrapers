925703,FLEX ROD,2015-07-22 13:32:00,394,"Once again I am turning to you folks who are always so helpful.  I have not fished Simcoe in years, and I would love to get out for a day of fishing in Cooks Bay but as I said its been years since I have fished it and I would like to take my son out tomorrow to chase some Largemouth.  Who still rents boats on Simcoe, in the Cooks bay area?  Any suggestions would be great, as my son has taken the day off work to spend with the old man on his birthday.  Thank you in advance,  FLEX"

925857,SirWhite,2015-07-23 13:15:00,210,There's a place in Keswick and a place in Lefroy that rent boats. I'm not sure if there is a place further south.

Even on cooks bay i've had some rough rides back and Im in a 16' side console with 40 hp. Makes my boat feel very little... Otherwise try the wall in front of Crates for some good pike fishing if their there!"
