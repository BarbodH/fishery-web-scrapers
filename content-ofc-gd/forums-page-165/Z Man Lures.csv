Only trouble is where to find them in Canada? Toronto to be more specific. Anybody have and suggestions? online they want as much for shipping as they do the lures. I hope its not my only option.... BPS apparently has Z man but Im not sure about in Canada. Thanks in advance for your help..."

One important note about their plastics...DO NOT put them in contact with any other plastics, it seems the rubber they use reacts to most other plastics and turns them into a gooey mess. I will not even keep them in the same box as others.  However, theirs plastics seem nearly indestructible and last a very long time."

One bait landed well over 20 walleye before it was chewed enough to replace. Outlast Gulp or Trigger X by a 10 factor easily. Favorite is Ralph's Shad 5""  Cabelas - USA"
