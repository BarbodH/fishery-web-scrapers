925572,wigler,2015-07-21 18:05:00,15,Been a member here for a while.  More of a lurker as opposed to a poster.  Love all the posts and the information.  Jealous of some of the fishing adventures you guys get into.  So my small adventure is heading to Three Mile Lake this weekend for a week at a cottage.  Never fished there.  Found some posts related to this lake from a few years ago but nothing recent.  Does anyone have any experience there?  What can I expect?  Should I target walleye or bass?  Or both.  Just have a canoe so I will not be travelling too far from home base.  Staying in the Eastern portion of the lake.  Any thoughts are appreciated.  Thanks.

I've got a buddy who fished that lake and catches them on pretty much everything.,  No monsters but a decent population for sure."
925714,cityfisher,2015-07-22 14:28:00,959,I used to have a place right off three mile lake.. fished it multiple times and landed some decent largies. Never hooked any eyes BUT i also wasnt targeting them.

I remember we'd catch nice eater size walleye and smallies.  Twister-tail grubs w/minnows were the tickets for both species, jigging along the bottom as well as casting and retrieving.  Simple."

Never caught any walleyes over a Lb or 2 there, but decent numbers  Try a Ripplin Redfin trolled early or late in the day. Perch colour, chrome or gold  GL MIKE"
925969,fishnguy,2015-07-24 02:41:00,96,Hey I'm heading up to that lake this weekend as well.  Staying at Forest Rock Resort with the family for a week.  Where are you staying?
