924847,Bondar,2015-07-15 14:37:00,817,At my house I have the junk router than cogeco gives when you sign up for Internet. The wireless range on it is horrible and cuts out in my small house. I'm looking to upgrade it but I have no idea what I should be looking for. I'd like to buy off Amazon of similar for a deal rather than going to Best buy or something like that. What would you guys recommend as I have no idea what any of the signs for a good router are. Simple set up and use would be nice as I'm not great with computer stuff Thanks for any help
924854,leaf4,2015-07-15 15:11:00,2466,"I used to have a d-link wasn't impressed with it and went with a Cisco dual band wireless N router, couldn't be happier and in a house with 6 guys, 4 of which have girlfriends so the potential of 10+ people connected at any point in time, we haven't had any issues in terms of speed or lack of connectivity at any moment in time, keeping in mind I have unlimited internet with 100mbps speed  Just did a quick search online, the Asus routers are looking to be a better option at a cheaper price point. There are some on Amazon listed in the $100 range that are faster than mine, and I believe I paid $129.99 or something like that"
924867,hutch4113,2015-07-15 16:21:00,374,"Would recommend an ASUS Router - like this -> http://www.staples.ca/en/ASUS-AC1750-Dual-Band-Wireless-Gigabit-Router/product_984098_2-CA_1_20001.  I have this one at home, and the coverage is good (3 Antennas make a difference).  AC is a new wireless standard - good explanation here -> http://www.extremetech.com/computing/160837-what-is-802-11ac-and-how-much-faster-than-802-11n-is-it.  Then AC1750 is an older unit - looks like it has been replaced by RT-AC66U (not to be confused with 2nd recommendation below).  If you don't have an AC wireless adapter, than the RT-N66U is probably fine.  Again it has 3 antennas, which will help in terms of range, etc. Do a search - but Staples might be the best location in terms of price - or at least it was when I was searching.  In terms of setup, they are pretty straightforward."
924921,BillM,2015-07-15 23:05:00,17367,I run a Trendnet AC1900 with DD-WRT and it's killer.  Can't go wrong with an Asus AC66/68 either.
924923,FloatnFly,2015-07-15 23:18:00,1640,ASUS all the way
924924,Bondar,2015-07-15 23:24:00,817,Thanks everyone
924925,Dan668,2015-07-15 23:34:00,1120,"I run an asus, its great except when it comes to mobile devices a floor up, for some reason it constantly cuts out,  and i run Merlin firmware, odd because with the laptop its fine. Gave up trying to figure out what was wrong with it."
924926,Bondar,2015-07-15 23:36:00,817,Hmm all I want it for is mobile device lol and on the second floor
924928,Dan668,2015-07-15 23:42:00,1120,"Lol,  i doubt you will have the same problem,  its been documented a few times on other forums, in saying that Asus routers are probably the best on the market. Whats your budget?"
924930,Bondar,2015-07-15 23:58:00,817,Don't really have one long as it stops cutting out
924939,cuzza,2015-07-16 00:36:00,467,"I have an Asus AC87 and it's fantastic - I live in a townhouse and no issues at all, previous one kept disconnecting and the Asus has that. I run up to 6 mobile devices plus a couple of laptops on it."
925664,Bondar,2015-07-22 06:36:00,817,Can anyone tell the difference between these 2? http://vi.raptor.ebaydesc.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItemDescV4&item=181391975253&category=44995&pm=1&ds=0&t=1437546649398http://vi.raptor.ebaydesc.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItemDescV4&item=171741148115&category=44995&pm=1&ds=0&t=1437546558521  http://vi.raptor.ebaydesc.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItemDescV4&item=171741148115&category=44995&pm=1&ds=0&t=1437546558521
925671,Dan668,2015-07-22 09:43:00,1120,Those are both the same model.
925672,BillM,2015-07-22 09:46:00,17367,"There is no difference, the R is sold at big box stores like BestBuy, the U isn't.  Just a marketing thing."
925684,Mister G,2015-07-22 11:47:00,1429,"All you really need is a wireless ""extender"" from Netgear. I have their model 2700 and it works great, extending my range anywhere in my yard including the garage. It cost me $35 including shipping from Amazon."
925924,Sebabmw,2015-07-23 21:06:00,13,Asus rtac68u very good router easy to setup as well range is great
