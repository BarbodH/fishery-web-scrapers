Anyway, a few people came back to me and suggested a solution which involved chilling them prior to deep frying them. OMG they are so fantastic! Everyone that has tried them LOVES them!  I have always tried to publically thank anyone that has ever helped me, I do believe that credit should be given where credit is due but in this case I don't know who to thank so If you were one of the people that suggested ""chill them before deep frying"" I thank you, my wife thanks you, my girlfriend thanks you, my mistress thanks you, my kids thank you.... ok, I might be pushing it a bit  LOL but I really do appreciate the tip!"
