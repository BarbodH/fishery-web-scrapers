I've been fly fishing for 40 years and still can't get enough of it. Currently on vacation in Batchawana bay and have only caught two trout in a week! Need suggestions please! Nice sunny weather though so I'm not complaining!"

926281,spincast,2015-07-27 00:43:00,3279,Welcome aboard. If you can - head up the road a bit to Lake Superior Provincial Park.. You'll probably figure the rest out by yourself.
