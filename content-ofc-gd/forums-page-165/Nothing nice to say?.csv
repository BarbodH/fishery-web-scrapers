925848,Old Ironmaker,2015-07-23 12:00:00,8243,I know you want to kill this thread Pete but a prime example of why I love this site is Roy's post #13( quote feature NW for me). That's what I mean by great humour.
925849,doubleheader,2015-07-23 12:16:00,497,"I'm mostly a lurker on here, but this seems like the perfect post to share my thoughts. I rarely find comments on this site anything but either good social sharing, informative, or simply funny. Mind you, I don't read every post, just ones that catch my eye, but the folks on this site, compared to another one I visit are generally good- natured and respectful, save for the occasional anti-native American rant . On this other site for instance, there is a fella who has 26,000 posts. That's right, 26,000+ posts!!!! Nothing else needs to be said about this guy. Another guy seems hell bet on only posting to brag about his latest boat purchase, and then there is the 30 something man who is married with two kids, has a home and a camp on a famous lake, and has every toy known to man. He has told everyone he'll retire by the time he's 50 inferring everyone who can't is a loser, and only after reading between the lines do you realize his daddy has paid for everything. The louse even complained when his ailing father gave him an aluminum boat with a Mercury outboard. He, of course, strongly prefers glass. Uggh!!! So, boys and girls of OFC, behave and play nicely or I'll send these three dufus's to your precious site share their wisdom and singular accomplishments. One fella, btw, is Canadian, which only proves we Americans don't have a monopoly on boorish behavior.   Have a great day."

925896,grimsbylander,2015-07-23 17:16:00,3016,There is a lot of truth in that post. Thank you.
925344,sneak_e_pete,2015-07-20 01:31:00,540,"I have been on this board for many years, so I feel comfortable speaking my mind.  First let me say that this forum is great, but I see a pattern with a majority of posts that kinda bugs me.  People ask an honest question, and they often get sarcastic or useless responses.  If you dont have a real value added post, than why post?  Examples:  I am having trouble with my motor....response...buy a new one.  Even Lew's recent post on geese went 3 pages but the legitimate responses were a page at most.  We are all on here for the same reason, and I feel that some of the attitudes and responses make people think twice about posting.  On here for 10 years or 1 day....any constructive post should be respected.  My 2 cents.  Thanks...and let the smartass responses fly"
925353,TennesseeGuy,2015-07-20 02:07:00,957,Lots of good friends on the forum and they carry on with each other.   Most of the time it's all in fun and they understand.  Good friends cut their friends some slack.
925360,Old Ironmaker,2015-07-20 06:08:00,8243,I come here to learn. contribute and above all have some fun. If it wasn't fun it would be called consulting Pete. Then I would put a few bucks in the jeans. If it wasn't fun sometimes I wouldn't be here. You need to lighten up a bit and have some fun.  Your opinion is respected by me regardless if I agree or not Pete.
925363,wormdunker,2015-07-20 06:30:00,1711,"Hey Pete - Sometimes you have to let it slide.  I also have read comments I disagree with but, I just ignore them while enjoying the comments of other people."
925370,Fisherpete,2015-07-20 09:24:00,1814,Yup  Just ignore the posts that are not helpful... I.e. Looking for rod storage for 6 rods - answer - only bring 1 or 2 rods with you lol!  You will still get great info from many of the amazing members here.
925382,misfish,2015-07-20 11:36:00,29133,Lots of good friends on the forum and they carry on with each other.   Most of the time it's all in fun and they understand.  Good friends cut their friends some slack.

925386,NAW,2015-07-20 11:48:00,4022,"I get what your saying Pete.  I often think the same thing.  But it never stops me from posting questions.  Some things just get blown way out of proportion some times, and you just have to shake your head and switch to the next post..."
925387,BillM,2015-07-20 11:54:00,17367,I think my flamethrower recommendation was perfectly acceptable
925389,sneak_e_pete,2015-07-20 12:06:00,540,That was funny!!!!  Not useless

925392,TennesseeGuy,2015-07-20 12:20:00,957,I miss Canadave.   Dave Cameron.
925399,Roy,2015-07-20 12:43:00,13728,I miss Canadave as well.  The old bugger is probably still alive even eh? He sends me a message once in a while but only when he needs financial help.
925401,captpierre,2015-07-20 12:59:00,2521,This site might be a little quirky some times but that will always be the case when you gather a group of people together. I think the mods do a good job shutting down the crap when it arises. I've learned a lot on this site and have had tons of questions/problems resolved. Fishing techniques Boat/motor issues ATV advice Lawn mower repair -thanks again Cliff Wheel barrow tire failure Cottage problems Firewood questions Now if I can just get some solid marital advice I'd be good.  ?
925403,SirCranksalot,2015-07-20 13:01:00,3291,"Yet another useless thread!!-----------------ooops, sorry about that. I guess I was supposed to be constructive! I agree with you Pete up to a point, but only up to a point. I also agree with other posters that it's humor that keeps the place alive and sometimes the humor gets lost. The saying is that 'sarcasm is the lowest form of wit' and I guess some of us reach a bit too far trying to be funny at times. Then, of course, there are the downright nasty and obviously unhelpful posts---no excuse for those."
925405,grimsbylander,2015-07-20 13:16:00,3016,"It's sometimes really easy to take written comments the wrong way. With no tone or facial expressions, it's dead easy to come across as being rude. Sometimes you have to give people the benefit of doubt. Or, pull out the big guns and verbally crucify them!! Lol Monday and Tuesday you can say what you want because we got out fishing and there's the afterglow effect. Wednesday and Thursday you better be careful...the ""I need to fish or kill someone"" has kicked in. Friday is 50/50 between those who are going to fish and those volentold to the honey do list."
925406,Roy,2015-07-20 13:34:00,13728,"""Voluntold""  Great word, thank you."
925462,FloatnFly,2015-07-21 00:02:00,1640,"Yes, 'voluntold' to get the house and yard cleaned up for my dads visit in 2 weeks.  need the brownie points for the 2 days of fishing lake o  that are coming!  but back on topic, its no different here, than it is in the work place or with a group of friends when you ask a question and you get smart@ss sarcastic comment back.  if you can't take the humour in it, why are you here?  All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy."
925469,sneak_e_pete,2015-07-21 00:27:00,540,"To get valuable information like most.  Sarcasm is one thing...but many posts go beyond that.  Are you saying that if I dont want sarcasm then why be here?  I may not be at the status of Lew, Roy, etc, but I have been here long enough to voice a frustration and long enough to point out that some members may refrain from posting due to the sarcasm.  There is a fine line between being helpful / funny and being an my father"
925470,sneak_e_pete,2015-07-21 00:28:00,540,"Ok...it took a hole and made it ""my father""...now that is funny!!!!"

There is a fine line between being helpful / funny and being an my father   Well for instance when you ask a question like you did, that can possibly have a sacarstic or semi sarcastic response, ie: bring less rods, why get your panties in a bunch about it, shrug it off as sarcasm and let it go"
925504,sneak_e_pete,2015-07-21 04:25:00,540,Enough said.  Like many I voiced a frustration.  Some agree..some dont...np...just voiced an opinion.  Lets let it go.  Whole point was to say that if you dont have any value to add to a post..(humour like flame throwers aside) than why bother.  Not expecting everyone to agree with me...but some of the long time members will agree that it can be hard to establish yourself on this site and some comments may be a turn off for newcomers as they dont understand the dynamics.

Usually the info I get is great.  Most of the guys on here are older then I am so they have had time to make the mistakes that I try to prevent.  Just the one thing I don't understand is why some people act tough on here.  I wouldn't say anything on this site that I wouldn't say to anyone's face.  To all the guys who have given me advice in the past thank you."
