Anyone ever drop shot with a live worm?  Do you constantly have to lift and drop so the worm doesnt sag or can you just let it sit there?  Thanks in advance!"

926091,Cosmos,2015-07-25 02:38:00,588,Try  Huroniabait. He usually has everything. It is my number 1 stop on my way to french river.
926196,Acountdeleted,2015-07-26 03:03:00,2562,My girlfriend and I dropshot with works all the time. Works like a charm. If you can pickup a worm blower that helps.
926200,Joeytier,2015-07-26 03:38:00,3990,"Should be lots of places to get minnows on the way up, and likely even more places to trap your own when you're up there"
926202,OhioFisherman,2015-07-26 04:10:00,6623,I am guessing a real worm would require a lot less movement than a plastic one? It does have a natural scent and look to it?
926215,Musky or Specks,2015-07-26 11:54:00,2710,I'm going to second Huronia bait in Festerton. THey always have minnows
926459,rufus,2015-07-28 12:40:00,267,I always use worms on a drop shot. Don't lift the weight off the bottom. Just let it sit on semi-slack line so the walleye can easily suck it in and still give it a bit of a jiggle every now and then.
926464,AKRISONER,2015-07-28 12:52:00,5558,im gonna vouch for my man in Pointe Au Baril   Right across from the shell station aka the side of the highway you are driving on you wont lose any time at all going. He keeps minners year round and is simply a really nice guy. Anything I can do to promote his business I will.
