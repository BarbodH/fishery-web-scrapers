925976,bigbuck,2015-07-24 03:26:00,2449,It has been far too long since I have fished for musky (a year and a half). I'm headed for Pigeon tomorrow morning. A buddy has a cottage by Gannon Narrows and that will be home base. He is going to share his spots and I'm sharing mine. Hopefully we tie into a couple and maybe a walleye or two for dinner....
925991,Gallie,2015-07-24 10:53:00,1215,Best of luck!
925993,fishindevil,2015-07-24 11:20:00,6254,the south end of the lake is very covered in the toxic algea balls of slime.....and its pretty gross looking head up the north end...as that slime robs the oxygen and fish scatter from it..... just some info for you
925996,lew,2015-07-24 11:44:00,12766,Have a great day Bruce and hopefully you get into a couple.  I'm the same as you and haven't fished the Kawarthas in a few years now.
926008,Hank Jr,2015-07-24 14:01:00,146,Good luck . Looking forward to your report
926063,Rizzo,2015-07-24 22:44:00,4754,"Good luck! I was there last week, got into a few. Gannons always coughs fish up for me, but not this time. Spent 4 or 5 hours there over the week and not even a sniff. That amount of time would usually get me a couple in years past. Hope you do better if you stick to that area!"
926093,bigbuck,2015-07-25 03:01:00,2449,"El Skunkola today. We raised one but it was disinterested in our offerings. Still, a gorgeous day on the water. I will take it ant time."
926094,manitoubass2,2015-07-25 03:17:00,11391,"Thats a bummer man but any day on the water is great, glad you enjoyed it!  Im totally new to musky fishing and Ive got zero musky in 3 outings. Total greenhorn lol.  But its fun trying"
