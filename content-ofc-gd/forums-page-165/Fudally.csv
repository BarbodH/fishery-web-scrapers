919715,mike rousseau,2015-06-12 17:40:00,4661,Hello  Anyone deal with these guys recently for musky baits...?  I placed an order 10 days ago and since then I have tried to contact them through email... Phone and Facebook... They have not replied at all... All I have received is a confirmation of my order and payment...  I'm getting close to making a report to paypal to get my money back... I really want the lures but Im nervous about getting ripped off now...  How long should I wait before trying to get my money back?
920088,JeffV,2015-06-15 13:49:00,5,I had a similar experience when dealing with Fudally.  The baits never showed up and despite repeated attempts I could never get a response via email or phone.  I would file a report right away.
920090,woodenboater,2015-06-15 14:18:00,2277,"if they haven't gotten back to you I would escalate it and make a paypal report. if you (fudally) have a webpage, then answer your emails. no excuses unless medical emergency."
920092,Lunkerhunter,2015-06-15 14:47:00,455,mike if your looking for twin 10's let me know. a buddy of mine is making very nice baits and can hook you up.  I have never purchased from fudally. but doesn't sound like good customer service so far  hope all works out for you

920104,mike rousseau,2015-06-15 15:22:00,4661,"Thanks for the feedback and PMs  I don't mind waiting as long as i eventually get the baits...  It's 10"" reef hawgs I'm after Andrew... There are stores with 8"" but none with 10""...  I'll give it another week just incase the guy is on a fishing trip or something then report to PayPal..."
920580,BillM,2015-06-18 12:01:00,17367,"Just make sure you file before the deadline with Paypal, it's something like 45 days no?"
925147,mike rousseau,2015-07-18 00:08:00,4661,Well  Sadly the company never contacted me and I never received my lures...  PayPal dispute had to be started and now escalated to a claim...  I'd stay away from this company... I'm going to look for another company with a similar product now...
925152,esoxansteel,2015-07-18 00:59:00,1307,"Todd Leopardi  aka  LEO LURES  make similar lures, not sure if he makes a 10 inch, but ive used 6 and 8 inch models and they work well and great paint jobs, tried to make my own but the ridge lines on the side have to be in line with each other and the same depth and length or they wont work, one of the tougher glide baits to make and work properly IMO"
925164,mike rousseau,2015-07-18 02:54:00,4661,I'm looking at Leo's as I type this
926140,mike rousseau,2015-07-25 18:19:00,4661,PayPal sided with me and I'm getting my money back...  Hopefully my order of Leos goes better
