925554,KraTToR,2015-07-21 16:16:00,506,"I just wanted to let everyone know that I'm really impressed with the new Rapala Scatter raps.  A guide I ran into while fishing the Kiwanis walleye derby turned me onto them and I can't say enough about them.  I've had great success with the shad type on BOQ and Pigeon for walleye and excellent success with the Scatter rap cranks on Long Point for smallies.  I haven't tested any of the other models (jointed, minnow, CD,etc) so please share..  The only downfall I've found is that the plastic bill that gives the bait its action does crack and break fairly easily.. Easy to fix with a touch of crazy glue that I carry in my TB anyways.  "
925557,fishindevil,2015-07-21 16:25:00,6254,"yes they work great and i have had 1 break as well on a 2lb smallie....but i did get a few kawartha walleyes on it,if it was suspendidng it would be a wicked bait  just my opinion tho...i am still trying them out"
925580,Big Cliff,2015-07-21 19:42:00,6899,"ask Paul what he thinks of them! He dropped mine in the water just to see what the action was like and wham LOL. I think his parting words were ""guess I'm going to have to go shopping again"" LOL..  BTW, Captpierre was the person that gave me my first one Many thanks again!"
925581,Steve,2015-07-21 19:45:00,2075,broke two lips so far....  tackle shop gave me new ones....  maybe a bad early run?
925582,KraTToR,2015-07-21 20:35:00,506,Maybe they picked the incorrect poly carbonate for the lips..  As far as suspending I thought I saw a countdown version....
925643,manitoubass2,2015-07-22 01:11:00,11391,If i see a countdown version ill buy a bunch in minnow patter and gold/black.  Action on these baits are awesome

925865,manitoubass2,2015-07-23 14:15:00,11391,Miigwich!  Just made me spend some cash lol
925870,porkpie,2015-07-23 14:41:00,2521," Xraps where the same for a few years when they first came out.  Busted dozens of lips.  Busted a pile of fish on them too!!  Newer xraps don't seem to break nearly as much.  Just what I need, another lure to buy."
925886,Acountdeleted,2015-07-23 16:24:00,2562,Shoot. I have one of these...... I just don't remember where I put it.
925888,manitoubass2,2015-07-23 16:43:00,11391, Yeah its in there????
925962,colin519,2015-07-24 02:19:00,101,BIG fan of the Xraps right now. great action and suspending.
