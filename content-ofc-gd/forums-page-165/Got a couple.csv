But that sun and lack of wind didn't help as we tried yet one more new spot on Erie.   we got one more on a Rap we picked up from Fisherpete - a nice 27 inch fish. He  was deep hooked (swallowed the rap pretty well whole) so he was a tad camera shy and and wasn't swimming too well by the time we got the third hook out of him, so he came home with us too.   holidays coming soon - fingers crossed for some back to back days on the water. Can't wait "

926314,msp,2015-07-27 13:27:00,1336,Nice. Are you using riggers to get those fish ?
926359,spincast,2015-07-27 21:23:00,3279,"smaller fish was taken on a 5 colour lead core off a planer. 27 incher was off the rigger, 90 back 35 down..  3 color core and dispy were silent yesterday, as were any size spoon, which is unusual for me."
926365,misfish,2015-07-27 21:58:00,29133,"Those fish look the same size Rick. Your just bigger thats all. Fish dosent stand out as well as G,s.  Nice outing fellas."
