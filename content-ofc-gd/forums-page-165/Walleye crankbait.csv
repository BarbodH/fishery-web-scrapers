925257,wormdunker,2015-07-19 08:54:00,1711,"Smaller lakes I like trolling small harnesses.  I usually do well. Crank baits I love hot n tots - any color.  Last year I started using Live Target smelt jointed 4 1/2"" silver with a hint of blue.  Landed some nice eyes on Erie.  I'm wanting to try the live target on Pidgeon."
925309,netminder,2015-07-19 19:28:00,514,"No one vote for the flicker shad? They seem to be highly rated, but never tried them myself."
925313,manitoubass2,2015-07-19 19:44:00,11391,I fish alot of current. Flicker shads suck in current.  Awesome on weedlines in lakes though  But still nowhere near my go too
925328,tbayboy,2015-07-19 23:03:00,1497,Suspending shad rap SSR#7 !!!!! Awesome  Third vote for the shad raps.  Jointed especially (perch and shad colorus)

925439,Headhunter,2015-07-20 19:47:00,5703,"I don't believe that they make power dive's any more... great Quinte fall lure. Op, I like different cranks depending mostly on time of year/water temps. Warm water above 60F, a tight wobbling crank like the above mentioned Power Dives or a Shad R etc... Cold water, below 60f down to freeze, a wider wobbling bait like a Mann's Stretch 20 or 30 tail dancer etc... HH"

925448,Steve,2015-07-20 22:49:00,2075,"lots and lots of responses.  unless I missed it, not one for Yozuri Crystal Minnow DD.  If I was allowed only one lure, casting, trolling, etc, it would be the clown Crystal Minnow DD."
925514,wormdunker,2015-07-21 10:01:00,1711,Not 1 mention of the original floating rapala black/gold?  Was an awesome lure when I was a teen!  I just recently added a couple to my tackle bag.  Gonna try them this Friday on Erie.
925660,Ron,2015-07-22 04:08:00,1683,"That's an incredible variety. I'm heading out to Rice lake this weekend and luckily for me I have most of what has been mentioned already.  What about any favourites for Rice this time of year? And what about methods, does one method out perform another? On Rice.....  Best crank bar none = Rapala shad rap SR05 in HOT STEEL. Slow retrieve, I mean very slow retrieve.  But instead of running crank baits, try using a basic black bucktail jig. Get 10 -15 ft into the edge of a weed line, any weed line don't matter the depth and just let it fall to the bottom and rip it back up."
925699,Garnet,2015-07-22 13:19:00,2056,What colour of Black Bucktail is that Ron.

Great for walleye and pike and even muskie  I like the jointed ones on Erie, they can handle a good speed unlike other Flatfish and Kwikfish lures. Big plus is that they last and last unlike some of the the baits mentioned."
