913251,mike rousseau,2015-05-01 13:42:00,4661,Great deal  Thanks for sharing
913288,davey buoy,2015-05-01 19:04:00,5505,Very nice !
913343,smitty55,2015-05-02 02:22:00,928,"Good price for sure, but check the reviews. Poor burner design. They take some mods or the wood chips can catch on fire. http://www.smokingmeatforums.com/products/masterbuilt-two-door-propane-smoker/reviews/4810  Cheers"
913347,bigugli,2015-05-02 02:36:00,6138,"Picked it up last year on sale.  Works great for us.  Chips or chunks will catch fire if they are dry, or if the heat is cranked. We cut and soak our wood a good 48 hours or more. In other words, we have a 5 gallon pail always full of soaking chunks of fruitwood, maple, or hickory. The bottom pan can also double for use with charcoal as well."
926265,woodenboater,2015-07-26 21:54:00,2277,"Resurrecting this thread with some info after using it a bit.  Have smoked side ribs only so far but salmon/ trout and pork butt are in the works. First smoke was 5 hours straight, no foil. Was good but not great ring. Next few were 3-2-1 method which was much better, or I got better quality ribs lol.  One thing about the Masterbuilt I need to tweak in the temp control. VERY hard to maintain low and slow with this unit. Looking at getting a needle valve to allow finer control of temps. Speaking of which, the built in temp gauge is way off. Picked up a Maverick 377 and life is so much better. Wireless so I can monitor from inside or out.  also these two sites are great resources for all things meat  http://amazingribs.com  http://www.smokingmeatforums.com"
926269,Big Cliff,2015-07-26 23:20:00,6899,"I ended up getting the electric, it was a little more money but really worth it."
926280,gaspumper,2015-07-27 00:41:00,393,"Another good one is.  "" the q joint"""
926284,mr blizzard,2015-07-27 01:29:00,1589,"Great deal wish we were closer looking for a used little smoker but ironically no one has what we want up here, good deal though enjoy"
926287,woodenboater,2015-07-27 01:36:00,2277,"I also have two Weber kettles (one at home and the other at the cabin). I plan to use those for smoking using the snake method, otherwise would bring up the Masterbuilt.  @Big Cliff, I hear you about the simplicity of electric but the cabin is off grid so propane or briquets is the better option for me"
926371,misfish,2015-07-27 22:23:00,29133,"woodenboater,,,,,,,,,,,,  Thanks for the links. Im not using a smoker, but my method will do just fine for this. Here I thought it was my deep in a sleep  brain storm, but seems to be well known.LOL  Fried egg, BONUS addition.   http://www.smokingmeatforums.com/t/136328/hes-loco"
926383,woodenboater,2015-07-28 00:15:00,2277,I dunno about that Loco Moco Brian. I love bacon and eggs but that looks totally whack ! I'd try it though lol. can't be any worse than the Garbage Plate at Nick Tahou...
