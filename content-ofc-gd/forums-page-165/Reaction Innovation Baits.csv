925774,wallyboss,2015-07-22 20:41:00,1095,My favorites are the White Trash Skinny Dippers.  But sorry I don't know where you could find them  I know that Paddletale's and Sail in Ottawa has them.
925839,singingdog,2015-07-23 10:28:00,1047,I think the tackle shop in Bridgenorth carries them.
925859,jimmer,2015-07-23 13:32:00,2730,Thanks guys. I'll call Frank in Bridgenorth.
925876,Lape0019,2015-07-23 15:54:00,647,"If Bridgenorth doesn't have them, call Ed at Paddletales. He will ship them out to you."
