There was some great looking toys. Some even for sale. Everytime I said I want that, the mrs,s would say, you wish, you could have that. ME BAD. LOL  Seems I cant link direct anymore. Has you tube or the site changed their settings?  https://youtu.be/XgRr6BRnJNw  I look forward to hearing some comments on the milk truck. It was  very cool."
926150,spincast,2015-07-25 21:07:00,3279,  here you go -  some sweet rides !
926151,misfish,2015-07-25 21:15:00,29133,Thank you SIR.
926152,lew,2015-07-25 21:17:00,12766,"Lotsa great cars there Brian, thanks for posting them. There's a classic car show over in Bridgenorth every Monday evening that I go to some times.  That '58 Impala has always been one of my favorite cars and if I ever find myself with an extra100 grand I don't need I may just get me one LOL  When I was a kid in the 50's in Toronto my grandmother lived just north of Christie Pitts and just around the corner from her on Christie Street there was a dairy that had a milk truck just like the one in your video. Don't know of any other dairy that had one and wonder if it's maybe the same truck.  Pretty kool rig anyhow."

926199,irishfield,2015-07-26 03:22:00,26272,"I showed mine to the light of day for the first time in almost 14 years Brian. Pulled it out of it's marine container earlier this week. Hooked up my kicker can to it with fresh fuel (mix of premium and 100LL Avgas) and she started on the third crank. Idled smooth with no smoke and runs like a top. Testament to how tough these old motors are, now if only my 26 year old paint job had of held up as well in the container I'd be a happy man."
926220,mr blizzard,2015-07-26 12:52:00,1589,"Brian, that was a sweet ride, man o man miss those car shows, used to take my son every year to the Barrie racetrack to check out the cars, then to Alliston and Orillia, nothing like that up here  LOVE the milk truck thats a first, used to be a huge Mopar fan back in high school and college, had a Plymouth Satellite till my brother wrote it off (stuff happens),  I laugh at it now, well just a bit BUT I sure wasnt laughing when it happened lol, main thing he was fine  That International looked sweet as well, thats when cars and trucks were real, real engines, real frames, real steel, real welds, no glue required  Thx so much for posting, real treat"

Wayne how much?  just kidding sort of, great looking set of wheels"
926222,musky666,2015-07-26 13:04:00,126,"Nice car Wayne, didn't you have a winged car as well? That my sons and mine '66 slopeback in my avatar- motor is out right now, but someday we wills stroke it out a bit and put an aluminum top end on her....someday"
926247,misfish,2015-07-26 17:23:00,29133,"Wayne, can I drive it? I wont leave the yard, I promise.  John, My first legal street ride was a 69 Coronet. 440.  My first ride ever was the Falcon Ford. We just drove it out the the cow pasture.  666, I like the look. Simple. Makes people think whats under the hood."
926253,Terry,2015-07-26 18:17:00,14456,great cars great job on the video too
926254,irishfield,2015-07-26 18:29:00,26272,"Don't go too fast Brian because it has no brakes! Master brake reservoir evaporated dry and even after filling it pedal goes to the floor, good thing it's a 4 speed so I can still move it as I wish.  Yes 666, I've owned the Bird below since 1989.. (the 'Bee my father bought new)"
926257,Old Ironmaker,2015-07-26 18:52:00,8243,"Thanks for the memories Brian. I'm saying through the entire slide show "" I had one of those, there's Dad's 55 Chevy, there's Rick's 57 and on and on. Thinking about how many of those rides I scrapped or sold for 100 bucks makes me cry.  My favorite is probably the Triumph GT6 probably because I drove one in High School. Because of my pain issues I'm seriously thinking about selling the boat. (1 day on the water equals 3 days resting). I would then pick up a classic car all done on the cheap compared to what they were going for before 08'. There is a sweet butter coloured Belvedere convertible in Dunnville that I would love to have. My pal out here just picked up a solid 1929 Dodge with rear suicide doors we are going to finish over the winter. He has already put in a modern suspension all around with disc brakes and is dropping in a 76 Corvette L88 I have in his barn."
