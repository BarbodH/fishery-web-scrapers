925790,captpierre,2015-07-22 22:59:00,2521,Have a typical built in Sony Marine Radio for music/ news. Came with the boat.  Turns on and everything but no sound with the radio setting.  Nothing. No matter  how much I crank the volume.   Couple years now.  When I plug in the iPod into the aux port  I get great sound.  I'd like to fix that.  Any idea what I should do?  Thanks. Peter

925795,captpierre,2015-07-23 00:02:00,2521,It's like a car radio. It has an antenna and it seems to be hooked up
925808,Tom McCutcheon,2015-07-23 01:44:00,627,"I guess the next question would be, have you checked to see if there is a separate selection tab or button to switch from the external IPod or Aux. port to just AM or FM?"
925830,wormdunker,2015-07-23 07:53:00,1711,Is there an inline fuse on the wire that powers the radio?  Check there first.  Any loose wires dangling down behind the radio - such as a ground wire?  Good luck!
925841,bigbuck,2015-07-23 11:30:00,2449,"How old is the radio? Unfortunately, radios do not last that long in a marine environment with all the moisture. Thankfully, they are fairly cheap these days. A decent unit can be had for 150 bucks or so."

925879,Gerritt,2015-07-23 16:04:00,6129,I suspect the attenna to be the culprit. Does the tuner keep searching for a channel?

925900,captpierre,2015-07-23 18:08:00,2521,Checked all the wires. All solidly connected. The tuner doesn't  search. Not even a bit of static when volume turned up with tuner on. I suspect it's a problem in the unit itself. ?
