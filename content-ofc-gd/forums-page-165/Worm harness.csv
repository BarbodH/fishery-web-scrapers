924355,porkpie,2015-07-11 23:37:00,2521,"If you intend to troll, the easiest possible way you can use a worm harness is to use a 1-2 ounce bottom bouncer.  It takes almost all the guess work out, even my kids know how to use them.  0-15 foot, use a 1 ounce bb.  15 foot plus, use a 2 oz.  Drop harness and BB until you feel it hit bottom.  Let your troll pull the rig up off bottom.  Then let out anothe foot or so.  If you feel if dragging or being in constant contact, reel it up a foot or so.  Troll at 1-1.5mph.  If there are pickerel present, you'll eventually catch some."
924468,mike rousseau,2015-07-12 18:03:00,4661,If you fish current you'll need more weight...  I usually run 3-5 oz when trolling spinners... 4oz 99% of the time
924469,Joeytier,2015-07-12 18:09:00,3990,"I'm not too picky with my harnesses most of the time.  In clear water I will stick with smaller Colorado blades and a more neutral colour, and in dark waters I like willow blades and bright colours with more beads and floaters.  A good presentation is far and away the most important factor in my opinion.  Most of my 'harness' fishing is a couple beads and a small Colorado blade and a couple shot for creek specks lol.  Also a deadly tactic for inland bows trolled across the middle of the lake right on top!"
924498,Mister G,2015-07-12 21:45:00,1429,"If you fish current you'll need more weight...  I usually run 3-5 oz when trolling spinners... 4oz 99% of the time YES, Mikey is correct but if no current you don't need a lot of weight unless you must stay close to da boat along a weed edge.  I fish a lot of Lake Erie walleye and I RARELY use more then 5/8 oz of weight in 40 - 60' of water using 8# line.....I just let out more line to get near da bottom.  Different strokes for different waters."
924644,Oggie,2015-07-14 00:03:00,588,I like the brass and silver Colorado blades and if that's not working I go to perch coloured (fire tiger) blades.  Orange blades work well for me in colder water. I use the quick change clevise as well but I rarely bother to change the blades.
925981,Dabluz,2015-07-24 04:16:00,701,"I prefer making my worm harnesses.  That way I can use the best quality equipment.  I make my harnesses with usually 1 Colorado spinner, a couple of beads in front of the spinner and 4 or 5 beads behind the spinner.  I use rather heavy stiff mono and tiny metal beads in front and behind the clevis.  I then add a swivel.  I add 2 or 3 hooks snelled on 8 lb Trilene Sensation with a length of line in front of the 2 or 3 hook combo so that I can adjust the length of line between the spinner(s) and the bait.  No bass where I live.  I use my worm harnesses for walleye.  I dislike fishing with bottom bouncers because I find that it's too heavy but if the walleye want them, I have no choice but to use them.  I found the dandiest beads in the sewing department at Walmart's.  They light up like walleye eyes when light deflects on them.  I bought all that the store had on hand.  I made a bunch of harnesses and gave most of them away.  I still kept a few for myself and will be making more this coming winter."
925986,fishindevil,2015-07-24 09:06:00,6254,There really is no end to how funky you can make a harness !!! I used to get beads in micheals craft store too lots of different colors & even glow in the dark beads & blades I also used to paint blades & use nail polish with sparkles it goes on & on !!!! It's a great thing to know that everyone if my harnesses are a 1 of a kind !!!! I used to make hundreds & hundreds of them and sell them and that would always pay for me to re-stock plus make plenty enough for me to fish with them at no cost !!!!!     Like I said before there is not much you cannot catch with them ....
926033,davew3,2015-07-24 17:09:00,430,"Depends on the depth.  Stained shallow like BOQ,  green or orange.  Lake Erie  40 ft,  large bladed purple.   There is a color chart out there that shows what colors tend to fade away depending on the depth. I think it is more on the shape of the blade and what vibration it kicks out when fishing deep.  Regards"
923899,Hansuld71,2015-07-08 16:16:00,9,What are your guys favourite colour for worm harnesses ?  
923901,pics,2015-07-08 16:19:00,1268,Fire tiger!!
923903,leaf4,2015-07-08 16:26:00,2466,Purple
923904,Craigson,2015-07-08 16:30:00,117,Depends on water clarity but weve found light purple to be good in Northern tannin stained water
923905,captpierre,2015-07-08 16:33:00,2521,Kawarthas?  One hook or 2?
923910,manitoubass2,2015-07-08 17:01:00,11391,"Hammered copper is my go to.  I also like silver/pink, straight black or black and lime green"
923914,glenner,2015-07-08 17:33:00,56,"Yellow and black or perch pattern on Sturgeon. In the rare case that doesn't work, I go to hammered copper blade with black beads"
923969,2 tone z71,2015-07-08 22:31:00,1311,ole school red/whites..chartreuse/silver
923971,fishindevil,2015-07-08 23:00:00,6254,Perch & fire tiger !!!! I make my own too so lots of colors work .... And with 2 hooks
923974,Mister G,2015-07-08 23:39:00,1429,"I also have made my own for over 30 years and here what REALLY works on Lake Erie for walleye..  WAIT FOR IT....WAIT...WAIT...LOL  But  really just a #4 Colorado blade with FIVE orange beads followed by 2 hooks.....I don't even bother with anything else when BOTTOM BOUNCING this rig in Lake Erie.......now I did use many other combinations when I use to run worm harness for suspended walleyes but no longer fish that way because it more work then fun and it's what I consider ""Harvesting"" rather then ""FISHING"".."
923979,porkpie,2015-07-09 00:31:00,2521,"I carry multiples of maybe 6 blade colours.  It covers almost anything I want to do.  I run with Chartreuse, silver, gold, purple, orange, and a bronze type. .  With the exception of silver and gold, most of the other blades are half and half with a bit of black, or some other colour. I have maybe 12-18 harnesses in the boat, and most are duplicates of good producers.  I've found I can catch fish anywhere with these colours and a mix of different beads.  I carry some spare beads and blades and hooks in the boat as harnesses will get beat up after a while.  They are really easy to retie.  I've seen guys go nuts with dozens of harnesses in a bizarre array of colours. but really probably 4 patterns would cover all your bases.  Anything with chartreuse/black, silver, purple, and a bronze/black blade would do the job almost anywhere.  It's like husky jerks, you only need 4 colours in a size 12 to catch anything that swims!"
923980,bigugli,2015-07-09 00:37:00,6138,"My son swears by a white combo, or silver and white. My prefs are firetiger, or any colour mix on a daredevle patterned blade"
923999,mike rousseau,2015-07-09 04:33:00,4661,The one their biting that day
924003,fishindevil,2015-07-09 07:56:00,6254,Some I make with 2 Colorado #3 or 4 blades a few beads in between and some just a number 5 Indiana blade with a few small beads and that's all don't usually ever use willow blades just Colorado & Indiana and for beads # 5& 6 also I use interchangeable clevis so I can change blades on the fly !!!! Have been making them for over 40yrs learned from my grandfather when I was a young boy !!!! They are the most versatile bait there is and will pretty much catch everything !!! And all my personal biggest muskies have all come from trolling harnesses weather on a bouncer or off a board or just flatline trolling even cast into current and reeled in can't beat them that's for sure !!!! Lol ....and it's easy to work one and easy & fairly cheap to make your own too !!! Even a few of my biggest bass & pike have all come from harnesses like I said earlier in a post I even caught a lake trout this spring opener in Haliburton trolling a harness for walleye a decent 4lb trout too !!!! Lol ....not many species of fish will turn down a nicely presented dew worm on a spinner !!!! Is a dead wringer folks !!!!!
924004,wormdunker,2015-07-09 09:39:00,1711,My go to harness is always perch colored.  If it isn't producing - which is rare -  I'll switch to chartreuse or purple n black. Purple n black is especially good when the water is calm.  Perch color is better with a slight chop on the water.
924027,netminder,2015-07-09 14:48:00,514,"bronze, silver, gold, with bronze as my favourite with red beads. The olympics of pickerel fishing lol. Usually with single hooks and half a worm. Other colours tend to get hit by pesky pike and bass too often, with the best pike and bass colours usually being chartreuse or fire tiger."
924040,Craigson,2015-07-09 16:58:00,117,One of my personal favs up north is casting Harnesses with a cpl splitshot on the line. Harnesses are basically a weightless Mepps.
924041,manitoubass2,2015-07-09 17:14:00,11391,"If your not casting harnesses your missing out on a great technique for alot of species! I catch tonnes of crappie, walleye, pike and bass casting shorelines where trolling isnt an option.  Here is what I use. The snap sinker on the right. And i make alot of my own harnesses but this brand is top notch.    I dont like the harnesses too long for casting so I usually trim them down to about 14"" and retie the barrel swivel.  Also, these are deadly spinners for pike    No need for a leader, just a weight like I posted in the first pic and youll rarely get bit off"
924087,sneak_e_pete,2015-07-09 23:56:00,540,Perch colour or purple for me
924161,netminder,2015-07-10 14:19:00,514,"If your not casting harnesses your missing out on a great technique for alot of species! I catch tonnes of crappie, walleye, pike and bass casting shorelines where trolling isnt an option. There's this too. It opens up a whole new world when trolling an area isn't an option."
924181,manitoubass2,2015-07-10 16:05:00,11391,YES!  And people are shocked how many nice walleye and crappie you will hit in 1-4fow
924330,James77,2015-07-11 20:13:00,175,"I bought my first worm harness a couple months ago. I've tried it a few times and haven't had much success. What is the correct way to fish it? I was trolling it behind the boat. I tried some weights to get it lower in the water column. Thanks Manitoubass for posting that weight, looks like it would be better to use.  What is the correct way to rig the worm, any other tips or tricks?  Thanks"
924332,manitoubass2,2015-07-11 20:20:00,11391,"I rarely use worms myself.  One hook rig with 2-4"" berkley powerbait minnows(depending on species)  You can troll them of course but I like casting.  Cast at your target, let it sink, then just retrieve(speed depends on fish activity)  I like to cut my harnesses shorter, about 14"" or so(just to cast accurately)  If inm using a two hook worm harness im definitely trolling it in the outside of weed edges, drop offs or circling reefs"
924333,manitoubass2,2015-07-11 20:21:00,11391,Oh and I just nose hook the powerbait.  Golden shiner is my personal fav but the all work and last numerous fish(in most cases)
924340,captpierre,2015-07-11 20:48:00,2521,Picked up 4 and the guy said to weight them so they run  hear the bottom? I thought about 1-2 ft up from the bottom along a weed edge.
