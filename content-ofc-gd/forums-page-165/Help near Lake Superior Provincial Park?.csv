926223,troutster,2015-07-26 13:18:00,5,"I'm up here on Vacation near Batchawana Bay for two weeks looking for brook trout. So far I've caught two trout in one week. I've fished the Agawa under the bridge, Kenny Lake, Goulais Falls on Whitman Dam Road, Lower Tilley and a beautiful spring fed lake on Gargantua and Speckled Trout Creek. I have a canoe, trolling motor for outside the park, and fly and spin gear. I've tried Mepps with worm, rapala, little cleo, crocodile, panther martin, hook and worm, egg sucking leech, muddler, hopper, streamers. I've tried casting, trolling with the motor outside the park, trolling with oars inside the park, still fishing, shore fishing, fly fishing from the canoe. So I really have been trying!Does anyone have a suggestion of a place I should try for brookies at this time of year that I can access fairly easily inside or outside the park? I have a two wheel drive pickup so most back roads are OK.  Thanks!"

926336,Dara,2015-07-27 16:17:00,3052,"  Which is why I always just refer to it as Mijin.   Yup, that and Gama"
926344,Musky or Specks,2015-07-27 17:04:00,2710,"  Yup, that and Gama I've already sent him maps for Mijin and that lake at the end of the North Arm"
926454,Dara,2015-07-28 12:11:00,3052,Just don't send him to the next one past that  DouG would be ticked
926523,Joeytier,2015-07-28 19:32:00,3990,"you're not allowed electric motors in lspp?  Also, try trolling small spoons and rapalas with enough weight to get you down 9-12 feet.  Most fish will be a little bit deeper this far into the summer"
