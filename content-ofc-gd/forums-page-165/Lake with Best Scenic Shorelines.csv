925947,alexw,2015-07-24 00:00:00,74,Thanks Mike. Unfortunately no one in the group is into fishing except for me.
925977,Steve,2015-07-24 03:28:00,2075,GB is beautiful..certainly....  honey harbour is a nice area.
925980,adempsey,2015-07-24 04:06:00,1498,"The public boat launch in the town of Rosseau is really nice.  We were up there a couple of weeks ago.   I wouldn't say it's the most scenic lake [at least, what I saw of it] but I suppose it depends on what you're looking for.    Lake of Bays is more scenic IMO.  My preference is for lakes that are within or border Provincial parks.  That way you don't have to look at cottages all along the shoreline."
926046,CRUD150,2015-07-24 20:02:00,87,"Gbay out of Wiarton, or Lake huron, around Oliphant area.  my fav, not to mention the fantastic swimming and small mouth bass fishing there is there, and you can't beat a lake huron sunset.  heres a pic from the islands there   I agree. Also Lion's Head is fantastic ,  with a great marina and launch."
925738,alexw,2015-07-22 16:40:00,74,"Hey Guys,  We are having the in-laws visiting from abroad, and I would like to take them out boating and show off our beautify Ontario lakes. In your opinion, which one of the lakes around Toronto has the best scenic shorelines? I want to avoid the big lakes as my boat is only 17.5 ft, and preferably within 2hr distance from Richmond Hill. If the lake has good fishing, it is definitely a plus!  Thanks in advance!"
925739,Pike-stalker,2015-07-22 16:50:00,6,I'm thinking one of the lakes due north of you in the Haliburton Highlands would be nice. One with the rock cliffs dropping into the water. I can't think of one off the top of my head but there are many in that region.
925741,dave524,2015-07-22 17:03:00,4508,"You could go the famous celebrity route and go with the "" Hamptons of the North ""  Lake Muskoka or Rosseau."
925742,BillM,2015-07-22 17:06:00,17367,GBay is the easy winner here.
925746,msp,2015-07-22 17:18:00,1336,Scugog ? Just kidding. A second vote for G bay
925747,lookinforwalleye,2015-07-22 17:23:00,4399,ya Georgian bay for sure....Parry Sound area...
925748,BillM,2015-07-22 17:27:00,17367,You can take them out of Honey Harbour and be well protected from the bay and have some killer views if you head up north past Tomahawk Island.   Some of the cottages around that area are insane.
925755,alexw,2015-07-22 18:04:00,74,Thanks everyone for your great suggestions!  Honey Harbor in GBay or Lake Rosseau is looking good! Can you please also recommend a good boat ramp for Honey Harbor and Rosseau?
925756,ketchenany,2015-07-22 18:07:00,3229,"lake Superior North Shore!, The Soo to Thunder Bay."
925765,Sinker,2015-07-22 19:49:00,8692,"I'm a little different I guess. I can't stand lakes that are lined with cottages, and I really don't like most of the people who own these fancy mansions on the lakes. To each their own.  I'd head up towards haliburton/bancroft area myself, but that's just me.  S."
925766,Acountdeleted,2015-07-22 19:49:00,2562,"G Bay. Go to Tobermory.  Else, do the Trent."
925768,davew3,2015-07-22 20:00:00,430,The Moon River at Bala.   You can choose the lake or the river.
925771,Garnet,2015-07-22 20:33:00,2056,I would take them on the Muskoka boat cruise and then pick good fishing lakes for good fishing.
925775,AKRISONER,2015-07-22 20:42:00,5558,"Parry Sound 30,000 islands cruise is a good one...  Honey Harbour has a public boat launch right in town..easy launch, lots of parking available...Im lucky enough to have a place on GB, theres plenty of protected area and its not very far at all.  A little bit further, the pointe au baril area is gorgeous, free public boat launch, and some unbelievable boating"
925786,misfish,2015-07-22 22:28:00,29133,I would take them on the Muskoka boat cruise and then pick good fishing lakes for good fishing.  Yes to this or the Midland tour. Enjoy the day and have a lunch on board.  Not sure I would want to be cruising around on waters I didnt know on my own boat
925788,SirCranksalot,2015-07-22 22:47:00,3291,I've done both the P Sound and the Midland cruises and I think P sound wins hands down. If you'te taking your own small boat 6 mile lake would be a good choice.
925802,Canuck,2015-07-23 01:03:00,491,"I have boated all over the 30,000 islands. Around Parry Sound is beautiful but I think north of honey harbour has a lot of similar scenery once you get away from the main boating routes which can be crazy with big boat traffic that can rock you around in a small boat.  If you are looking for a cool area you could try the moon river and Massassauga Park area. Then a cool experience is lunch at Henry's on Sans Souci island. Not sure where to launch but I think there is a ramp at Moose Deer marina on twelve mile bay which is a bit south of San Souci.  But for ease of access I would say honey harbour.  The south end area is like Muskoka and once you get north of beausoleil island the shoreline starts to get more classic Georgian Bay rock and pines.  Either way you need charts and better yet a gps chart plotter. Lots of rocks to hit and the channels are not always clear."
925807,GBW,2015-07-23 01:36:00,8460,"to me the real question is, do you want to cottage shop from a boat and look at lot's of places or want to look at trees, rock, cliff walls? (and I don't mean Big Cliff's walls of his home either there  ) What ever lake you go to, best be checking for some maps of the lake too for your safety"
925809,Crazy Ivan,2015-07-23 01:44:00,184,"I agree with massassauga PP. The launch in Blackstone harbour is nice and I think you can get a day use pass. It's been a while since I've been. Beautiful scenery, not many cottages."
925814,alexw,2015-07-23 03:19:00,74,Thanks again everyone. That's a lot of info to digest. Will do further research tomorrow based on the great info here and then decide. Safety is indeed a concern.
925815,John Bacon,2015-07-23 03:21:00,3277,Baptiste is nice.  That would be closer to three hours from Richmond Hill though.
925827,wormdunker,2015-07-23 07:30:00,1711,"French River, Wolseley Bay.  I know it's a little further than you wanted to drive.  G Bay is awesome, but, too many rocks for my liking.  Pretty scary when you look 10' to the side of your boat & there's a huge boulder 6"" below the surface!!"
925834,BillM,2015-07-23 09:04:00,17367,"  Honey Harbour has a public boat launch right in town..easy launch, lots of parking available...Im lucky enough to have a place on GB, theres plenty of protected area and its not very far at all.    That ramp has been closed for a long time."
