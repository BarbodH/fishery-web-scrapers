925482,SirCranksalot,2015-07-21 01:49:00,3291,I sent the following e-mail to Daiwa nearly a month ago and haven't heard a peep!!  
925485,BillM,2015-07-21 01:54:00,17367,"You shouldn't be surprised you didn't get an answer, email is like snail mail.  Easily ignored.  Pick up the phone and give them a ring."
925491,Beavertail,2015-07-21 02:30:00,331,"Try giving ""Aikman's"" a call. I've ordered quite a few parts from them in the past, for Abu's as well as Daiwas. If you know the part number he should be able to get it for you. 1 (905) 277-3595"
925493,NANUK,2015-07-21 02:48:00,797,"Daiwa never had good customer service in Canada, Lately it is non existent, I don't even see their booth at the fishing show any more. Your best bet is Aikman for Daiwa parts."
925497,Lunkerhunter,2015-07-21 03:10:00,455,Yes aikmans. Had a reel repaired there before and was good service
925508,fishindevil,2015-07-21 08:07:00,6254,Yes aikmans is likely the place they repaired a few of my quantum  reels & a few Abu reels in the past and they were old but found parts and still to this day they work awesome !!!  Thumbs up for aikmans    )
925528,SirCranksalot,2015-07-21 12:10:00,3291,thx guys. you are a whole lot faster than Daiwa!!
925531,craigdritchie,2015-07-21 12:22:00,1586,Call Daiwa and they will direct you to Aikmans anyway. Aikmans is their service center in Ontario. Daiwa's Canadian operation is just a sales office.
925564,SirCranksalot,2015-07-21 16:55:00,3291,"Try giving ""Aikman's"" a call. I've ordered quite a few parts from them in the past, for Abu's as well as Daiwas. If you know the part number he should be able to get it for you. 1 (905) 277-3595  thx for that #, just called them and re-ordered. I should have the parts in my hand in a week for about $10"
925686,MCTFisher9120,2015-07-22 12:05:00,3761,"As the other guys said Aikmans is the way to go. Unless it's Shimano no other brands really have good warranty/part centres up here. Rocky's and Aikmans take care of Quantum,Okuma,Daiwa,Abu,Pflueger and Mitchell reels."
925712,NANUK,2015-07-22 14:26:00,797,Mike's Reel Repair in BC is also an authorized service centre with awesome customer service. Some times it is cheaper to pay shipping on small items from BC than to drive to Aikman in Mississauga.
925720,SirCranksalot,2015-07-22 14:56:00,3291,why not get Aikman to ship/post? They are doing that for me.
925730,NANUK,2015-07-22 16:04:00,797,"I have had much better service from Mike's. They also stock a lot more parts and accessories, power handles. Upgrade kits like better bearings and drag washers, I can look it up on their website before ordering,"
925743,lew,2015-07-22 17:13:00,12766,Some times it is cheaper to pay shipping on small items from BC than to drive to Aikman in Mississauga.  I needed a power handle for a Calcutta TE and it was cheaper to order it from Shimano & have it shipped from their outlet in California than it was to order from Gagnons in Oshawa and have it shipped 75 miles north to my place.  Sometimes it's cheaper to order from a long ways away rather than local.
925803,Canuck,2015-07-23 01:15:00,491,I guess it must have been better a few years ago. I had a couple parts break on my Sealine level wind and emailed Diawa. About a week later an envelope arrived in the mail with the parts. No invoice just a packing slip. No duty because the packing slip said warranty replacement parts.
