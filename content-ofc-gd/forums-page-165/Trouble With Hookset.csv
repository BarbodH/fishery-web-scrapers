As a rule i dont set the hook until i feel the hit, see the lure go below the water and feel the fish kicking away."

924876,manitoubass2,2015-07-15 16:59:00,11391,"Honestly I dont fish those snagless frogs often, and when I do Its usually a test to see if bass or pike ate active in the slop.  The post about holding the rod at 11 oclock during retrieve is great!  I have my own method and its similar abit.  I loosen my drag, fish hits and I have to tighen my drag to set the hook.  Similar concept, it makes you wait a few extra seconds.  I like this method because the fiah feels no weight or pressure.  Anyhow, I hate livetarget frogs. I find them the worst of the bunch.  I honestly like the cheaper versions, like matzuo. But I also found some awesome ones at the great bear from a few companies ive never even heard of lol  They dont puncture so easily and fish awesome.  In dence weeds my go to is still a berkley chigger craw in black and red fleck, texas rigged and a bullet sinker. I can fish the top, middle and bottom with that rig and it flat out catches fish"

924945,Garnet,2015-07-16 01:02:00,2056,Yes I still have my Johnson Silver minnows and use them occasionally. Uncle Josh NO.  Senkos and flukes t rig have acceptable 80-85% hook up. No throw back cast just stop and bait sinks.

925060,ONbuckhunter,2015-07-17 01:47:00,39,This so much.  I use them prefishing (completely hookless) to locate fish.  I almost always fish during a tourney with a jig or a plastic.  I suck with frogs.  But I have complete confidence in using them to locate them then use a jig to pitch in.  Some guys are really good frog anglers but I agree with Garnet.  Odds are your better to throw something else if you wanna a solid hook up.  PS.  I meant to quote Garnet about hookup ratio with frogs but clearly I suck at quoting lol.
925065,MCTFisher9120,2015-07-17 02:24:00,3761,"When done properly frogging for a day can turn into a 90-100% hookup ratio. Three things I do when frogging the slop and sparse cover. Bend the hooks up slightly, especially on the LiveTarget Frog's, the hook size I don't like as I prefer the Bleedin' frog by Snag Proof but anyway bend the hook up slightly. Get a good scent and apply scent to your frog. With the hooks slightly bend up your going to drastically change your hookup ratio even when your staring off in the distance and miss the odd strike. The hooked slightly elevated over the rubber body when sticky sharp will always grab meat in the bass's mouth. Adding scent improves ""hang-on"" time. You get a extra 2 or 3 seconds on a frog bite when it tastes and smells real so fish will hang on and take them deeper. How many times have we walked a frog slowly while a bass follows behind. Some cases I see them right behind then they will commit. Other times it's a strike and hook-set. 3rd tip is count to 3. This has never steered me wrong and it's only when I set to early or late when things go wrong.  Strike, 2, 3, set the hook. Stiffer Ex-Heavy powered rods will allow you to maintain better control of 4lb+ largies. Most MH's and H's will get fish in the boat.  Lot's of fun keep at it it will soon become one of your favourite techniques. I'm about to head on a half month trip and most days I cast the frog probably 2-3 hours minimum. They are very productive. Every pad and slop bed around will have frog's on it or on the shore. A Frog is a rare opportunity for a bass so you will tend to get bigger than average bites. I'll take 10 bites on a frog vs a senko any day. Try frogging under the high sun, 11pm-2pm this way you will get a great shadow from your frog having the sun directly above you. Some of the best times of day are when all the ladies are on shore in the shade, get out in the heat just bring the big rod/reel and line for the fight."
925067,fishindevil,2015-07-17 10:05:00,6254,Yesterday I was 2 for 2 on the live target frog !!! Both largies landed !!!! Some days ya get em some days ya don't !!!! And flukes were the ticket yesterday like garnet says !!!! Let them sink I between the pads or drag em over the top & let them sink !!!! I prefer to use flukes in open water or over the weeds but they will work like a frog and do have way better hook ups for me anyways !!!! Speaking of that I need more .....

Seems to work for me, The anticipation is always there, I love top water for bass.  Yes!!! always liked a heavy fly rig ( 9 wt bass bug taper ) for weeds , especially pads. You can lay a popper in a card table sized opening and pick it up without retrieving and cast to the next opening. I like to watch for movement at the junction of the leader/flyline knot for when to strike. Big saving making you own deer hair mice and frogs over what those plastic ones cost."

925104,SirCranksalot,2015-07-17 16:46:00,3291,"I was just introduced to the top-water technique using those rubber froggies a few weeks ago. I thought that you'd fish with the hooks turned upward in heavy cover but flip the hooks down if the cover was light. Never mind the hook-up percentage, I got a big kick out of watching the fish jump for it even if most were just hammer handle pike! For me it was quite a different type of fishing----more like fly fishing than the usual cast and retrieve."
925131,Garnet,2015-07-17 20:14:00,2056,That's it if tournament fishing maybe not.  I'm going to Emily for few days and will be whipping a frog around. If they play beach volleyball with my little frog who cares.
925201,colin519,2015-07-18 16:15:00,101," I don't think we're talkin about the same thing. This is wall-to-wall lily pads or bullrushes/reeds. Some the size of a yard, some the size of a football field. If someone fishes it by only hitting the few, small ""holes"" with a standard topwater then someone else will come in with a weedless lure and clean-up as if it had never been fished. I'll try to take a photo if I hit the pads again before fall. I love walk the dog topwaters but this isn't the place for them, except for the edges before going in right up to your armpits. Agreed. I'm usually doing the edges and pockets along those beds.  That said, when I was young I'd fish largemouth in sloppy weeds with my brother in the dead of summer. We'd bomb big blue gold or silver Blue Fox spinners or other flashy buzz baits where we could, ripping them fast on heavy line often dodging in between grass blades and reeds. if you catch a fish in that on anything you've gotta pull it through slop anyway, but we would get some big bass that way. you would clean your lure every cast but eventually you'd clear a little lane or 3 to buzz. Haven't done that in years, now that I'm not shore fishing in ponds often."
925971,Dabluz,2015-07-24 02:51:00,701,"I don't particularly like the looks of those 2 hooks sitting so low on those frog lures and they are very expensive.  In the past 10 years or more, I often use Salad Spoons http://www.lunkercity.com/sal.html These lures float on the surface and when you give them just the right twitch, they go subsurface.  You can even bring them back up to the surface.  They twisty tail really beats on the water on retrieve when the lure is on the surface.  I use a 4/0 hook (usually Gamakatsu) unweighted or a VMC 1/8 ounce weighted 4/0 hook.  I also cut a groove in the lure so the hook will sink further into the body of the lure and therefore expose more of the point after hookup.  Otherwise, the hook point is just under the skin of the lure and therefore completely snagless and weedless.  I sure would love to one day see the same lure a bit larger than 5 inches."
926053,fishindevil,2015-07-24 21:18:00,6254,"salad spoons work awesome !!! i always have one rigged for buckets in the summer for sure !!!! i as well use a 4/0 hook owner hook,they work great those salad spoons and i think they have a better hookup ratio than my frogs doo,and you can burn them or fish them slow like you said...very versitile"
924725,bobowski,2015-07-14 16:35:00,360,"I love to fish top water for bass early in the morning. The anticipation of a fish coming from below and exploding out of the water to smash the bait is almost addicting. Lately I have been using Live Target Frogs a lot because I love that they are so weed less that you can basically throw them anywhere and not get hung up. But, because they are so weed less I have been having trouble getting a hook in to the fish. I have been trying to delay the hookset a little bit so the fish can fully take the frog but its hard to do when the fish hits and you get a ruch of adrenalin. My question to you fellow anglers is do you have any tips when using these live target frogs that would result in hooking more fish? Thanks   "
924728,kickingfrog,2015-07-14 16:45:00,8333,"For me it's not a numbers game. If my first goal was fish in the boat then I'd fish something else because you will not get the hooks into every fish, but for me at least it is fun even to have a miss.  Make sure the hooks are super sharp and wait until you feel the fish before setting. I also like them full of water so they sit a little lower in the water, but they don't land as soft that way."
924729,Acountdeleted,2015-07-14 16:49:00,2562,Agree with sharpening the hooks. Sadly I find live target hooks To be very very poor. I was using a baitball last fall and had 4-5 bass shake the hook. They may not be replaceable on the frog but make them razor sharp and it should make a difference.
924730,BillM,2015-07-14 17:00:00,17367,"Wait until you feel the fish then set the hook.  Too many people are setting the hook on the splash.. Also, bass are known for stunning their prey then coming back.  So if the fish misses, just let the bait sit there... 9 times out of 10 they'll come back and eat it up."
924733,Garnet,2015-07-14 17:10:00,2056,"If you are fun fishing just enjoy the show.  As a tournament bait they are a 60% hookup, you can include all makes. So I can get 40% less bites on jig and still win or you need to get 40% more bites.  Yes I view top water frogs as a losing strategy."
924745,jameshandz,2015-07-14 18:40:00,31,try trimming the tails  with scissors i do it with every live target i get since they are more for american bass which are usually double what we get in Ontario .
924746,Acountdeleted,2015-07-14 18:45:00,2562,This is great advice. I can't count the number of times I have missed a hookset on a bass or faught it for only a few seconds to have it hit again a few seconds later.  I always jokingly say 'the bass was more angry then I was about missing that'
924757,206,2015-07-14 20:11:00,563,if they want it you won't have to worry some days they just don't want it that bad. if you miss with the frog pitch a creature bait or a worm at them.
924759,grimsbylander,2015-07-14 20:28:00,3016,Hold your rod at the 10 - 11 o'clock position as you work the bait towards you. This will handcuff you so you cannot set the hook from that position. It forces you to drop your rod tip and reel in the slack for a proper hook set. This is the time it takes for the fish to turn with the bait. Your hook ups will increase dramatically. Always have a plastic bait rigged and ready to pitch in on the misses.

924766,jtracc,2015-07-14 21:08:00,97,"It's tough with those types of baits in heavy cover.  A lot of the time a bass will actually push the bait away as it strikes, added with the slop under it the hook up percentages are lowered.  If you miss a solid strike, have a second rod handy rigged with some sort of plastic worm, lizard or senko.  When a bass blows up and misses the frog reel in quickly and follow up with the plastic bait. A lot of times the bass will strike and you get your fish.  This works for me.  I also use this when casting reaction type baits.  If I get a miss, followed up with smaller slower plastic and boom.  Sorry just read what grimsbylsnder posted.  It works..."

924803,grimsbylander,2015-07-15 02:52:00,3016,Don't rule out mono for frog fishing. You may want to go up in weight but mono sinks MUCH slower than florocarbon and the added stretch will benefit your hook set issue. Braid has so little stretch you can pull the bait out of the strike zone with no effort.
924804,kickingfrog,2015-07-15 03:02:00,8333,Flouro does sink faster than similar strength mono but stretches as much or more.

924837,Acountdeleted,2015-07-15 13:58:00,2562,I also think it's perspective. If we could see underwater and see how many times fish attacked our lure or live bait and didn't hook up I'm sure we would be swearing like sailors at that too.

Really it's just different approaches to the same problem, flukes or senkos are probably a good choice too, a friend of mine used tubes almost exclusively, back in the day a Johnson Silver minnow and pork frog was popular.  LOL. I am a geezer, and almost always used mono, 17-20 pound test for the slop. You could make it float better and longer by stripping a 100 feet or so off the reel and applying dry fly dressing to it, keeps the line from sinking into the slop."
