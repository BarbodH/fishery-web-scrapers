925759,wkrp,2015-07-22 18:47:00,656,I have the gold navionics in my unit and for some reason I have lost the water portion on the chart screen . All I get is the land area showing on the chart which just shows  yellow on the screen. I am by no means very good with the new technology so any help would be appreciated.
925761,Tom McCutcheon,2015-07-22 19:19:00,627,"Where on the French are you fishing?  The Pickerel River and Lower French, (below Chaudi√®re dam) is not charted. If you are above the dam and into Lake Nipissing, you're charts should work. Depending on you're unit, sometimes just removing the chip and reinstalling while the unit is turned on will refresh the charts. (only if the area has already been charted)"
925797,Rich Clemens,2015-07-23 00:17:00,3131,"Correct.  The French is not charted.  I made my own from MapCreate just to get contours and for basic navigation, but that's it."
925892,doubleheader,2015-07-23 16:58:00,497,Could you possibly have a setting issue? If your screen is not showing water anywhere including areas you know your chart has displayed water in the past you probably have a setting problem or your unit is not recognizing your chip.
925905,BillM,2015-07-23 18:46:00,17367,"There are no hydro charts for the French, only certain parts of the west arm of Nipissing.  This is why nothing is showing up."
925906,jimmer,2015-07-23 18:53:00,2730,It would be quite the challenge to map the French River other than basic routes.
926087,Mister G,2015-07-25 01:27:00,1429,It would be quite the challenge to map the French River other than basic routes. WHY..........all the Great Lakes are chartered not to mention hundreds of thousand of lake on both sides of the boarder.
926092,Gerritt,2015-07-25 02:38:00,6129,Guess you've never fished it..... If you do you'd understand why
926123,OhioFisherman,2015-07-25 13:57:00,6623,"I was on the French River briefly for part of one day, and just a tiny portion of it. I can only imagine the time, effort, and money it would cost to chart it accurately? A man made lake has more of a chance of having accurate charts? As do lakes that have had shipping traffic?"
926134,Freshtrax,2015-07-25 17:05:00,2215,"Bring a spare prop , especially if you have never fished it......don't be fooled on the lower French by the locals ripping about at 30 mph..... It can go from 60fow to 2 in the blink of an eye way out in the middle of the river.     It also fluctuates year over year   Some years it's up or down 2 ft."
926135,Freshtrax,2015-07-25 17:06:00,2215,The chart would be hard to read with all the millions of red dots all Over it.
926136,Freshtrax,2015-07-25 17:15:00,2215,My first time through this section in a motorized boat was nerve wracking.      Pick your line wisely and hold fast.....might want a guy on the bow as a lookout.
