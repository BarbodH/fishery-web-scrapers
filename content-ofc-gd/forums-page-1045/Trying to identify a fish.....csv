191978,mikem,2008-04-24 23:12:00,3,"OK - surely this is the place to ask this loaded question!  My wife and her sister were wandering Garloch gardens in Oakville, and in a little stream there (by little I mean max 5 feet wide, maybe 2ft deep - but connected directly to Lake Ontario) and they happened upon 3 fish harassing another one.  We have pretty much identifed the harrased fish as a carp, but cannot figure out what the other 3 fish were....  After going through pretty much any type I could think of, and looking throught MNR ID charts, we are stumped.  The best that they can describe as identifying features:  2 (or 3) dark bands horizontal along the fish - one in line with the eyes, the other higher Head like a Largemouth Bass Foot or so in length Rounded top fin (they think...)  the fish themselfs were lighter in color - but unsure of the exact color because the water was kind of murky  they were harassing the carp together, in what the ladies thought were an agressive manner.  I am stumped - I was thinking striped bass - but not according to the ladies when we got our pics of them...  they are emphatic that the stripes were thick and dark, calling them bands, not stripes.  any help is appreciated - I hate to have a mystery like this unsolved!!!"

191985,kickingfrog,2008-04-24 23:20:00,8333,"I'll put my foot in my mouth here I""m sure (I'm kind of used to the taste anyway). But is it possible that the fish were mating? The ""harassing"" could just be a matter of perspective. Sounds like one female and three males."
191987,Gerritt,2008-04-24 23:23:00,6129,  Problem is there are no bands and no strip through the eye....    I like a good mystery....  G
