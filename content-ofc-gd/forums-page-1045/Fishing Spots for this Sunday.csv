191371,bajangal,2008-04-23 14:31:00,7,"Hello All,  I'd like to do some fishing this Sunday. I am a novice but love fishing and have not been out in over a year. Where would you suggest as good spots for fishing within a 1 - 2hour drive from Toronto in any direction. I only request that there be possibilities of catching something. I have been to rice lake a few times in the past and caught nothing....maybe it was my skill   . Thanks in advance for your help.  Bajan"
191376,Stoty,2008-04-23 14:43:00,2910,Lake Simcoe....your almost guaranteed to get something. Keep in mind that only panfish/trout will be open on Sunday.
191395,Reef Runner,2008-04-23 15:41:00,981,"Very true.  Be sure to check the regs for your destination before you head out and determine what species is fair game this weekend.  Goodluck,  reefrunner"
191544,bassmaster4,2008-04-23 21:52:00,801,you could also try the grand river for catfish...
191547,Canuck2fan,2008-04-23 22:05:00,1444,"I am thinking Lake Huron would be a good place to start, so with that in mind when I get a few hours that is where I am going to go...."
191561,MCTFisher9120,2008-04-23 22:56:00,3761,I was gonna go to lake Scugog try to catch some perch or something. Nothing else is open in the area right now but panfish.
191562,fish_finder,2008-04-23 22:59:00,370,why arent you goin out for trout bud?  opener is on saturday?
191709,yellowboat,2008-04-24 10:53:00,211,"Mike The Bass Fisher, Scugog is closed even for panfish."
191817,Pachone,2008-04-24 15:47:00,276,"its trout opener this weekend man.  Im a novice myself, but go up any river or stream that comes off lake ontario. go up a couple KMs. google map a decent access point. Research what to use and how to catch trout. AND they should be there. Try Rouge river, or wilmot creek or bownmanville creek. google it. u should have some luck. be careful not to trespass.  - Mike"

191896,Beans,2008-04-24 19:41:00,3339, Except for fishing off/near the causeway (Hwy 7A)...That is a sanctuary until pickerel season opens...  Why not go to Big Cliff's place and lend a hand puttin' in his docks...Free lunch !!!
191898,GBW,2008-04-24 19:48:00,8460,"I would but with my bad back I have a hard enough time doing my own at the cottage...  yes, good point about the causeway too."
