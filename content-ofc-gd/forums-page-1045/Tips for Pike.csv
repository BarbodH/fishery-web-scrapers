191727,MCTFisher9120,2008-04-24 11:30:00,3761,At the lake i fish at alot i see pleanty of pike. The problem is im a bass fisher and im not sure on how to catch these fish. Can i catch pike on any bass tackle i may have.
191734,Greencoachdog,2008-04-24 12:02:00,8163,"If a Bass will eat it, a Pike will prolly eat it too!  Start with Spinnerbaits."
191736,ccmtcanada,2008-04-24 12:04:00,7971, Yep...what Glen said....  Then try some Husky Jerks....
191738,OhioFisherman,2008-04-24 12:08:00,6623,"Fish eat fish and other usually smaller things in the water, mostly a bass fisherman myself and a lot of my tackle is geared to that species, but the fish don`t know.  I have caught bass, walleye, pike, sheephead, carp, muskie, steelhead, panfish, catfish, ect. on the same tackle. A lure in the water catches more fish than one in the tackle box.  Pike have teeth and overall a bigger mouth than a bass, use a steel or fluorocarbon leader, a lot of bite offs with out one. Crankbaits, spinnerbaits, jig and pigs, tubes, plastic worms, surface lures, pike eat them. Steel leaders may throw off the action of some lures, bass fishing at night can be great, not much luck for pike at night for me.  Just a trend I have noticed is a big pike in the area the bass disappear, a big feeding pike may cause other species to jump out of the water to escape, watch the water. Morning and evening near shore, mid day deeper water, deeper edges."
191745,little angler,2008-04-24 12:25:00,128,I caught 2 pike just by trolling with a worm harness really slow
191747,Stoty,2008-04-24 12:29:00,2910,"You will catch Pike a lot when your Bass fishing. They hang out in the same spots Largemouth do. (Weeds) Just make sure (if your targeting Pike), that you attach a wire leader to your line, so you dont lose all your good bass baits!!"
191750,richyb,2008-04-24 12:31:00,774,Spinner baits ROCK !!! i dont think i have ever went out and said ok today i am going to target bass... I always just head out onto the lake and start chucking my spinnerbaits and i catch my share of bass pike and muskie.
191752,bassman,2008-04-24 12:38:00,384,Spinnerbaits with a trailer hook and a grub.  Use a fluoro leader (20-30lb) with a uni to uni knot and a direct tie to the lure.
191753,BillM,2008-04-24 12:41:00,17367,"Agreed with what people have said here.  Only thing besides your bass tackle that you'll need is a decent 6-7inch wire leader.  Other then that, all your bass lures will work fine for pike (If you don't have a spinnerbait, get one  )"
191768,Reef Runner,2008-04-24 13:26:00,981,Don't lip 'em.
191775,Maverick,2008-04-24 13:46:00,371,"The longer minnow baits you have will work, husky jerk, original rapala. But my biggest pike, 30 pounder, came jigging for pickerel with a jig and minnow so they will eat almost anything."
191781,dim.,2008-04-24 14:06:00,16,My 2 cents about leader... BassPro has titan 30lb leaders. A bit expensive around 12$. But those leaders much thiner and more flexible than a regular steel ones. Or you can make your own from titanium leader wire. Pike spots your lure not your line when strikes so you do not have to use FC leader. And crimping titan is much easier job than tying large diameter FC leader (in term of the knot strength).
191849,addict,2008-04-24 17:38:00,475,"x-rap,or any other floating stck bait ,spinners topwater.i fish for pike every spring and one year it was so intense i tried every lure in my aresenol was able to get them to hit almost everything in the box they are eating machines."
191866,mustfish,2008-04-24 18:21:00,32,I love the top water poppers! What a blast!!!!
192090,Zubris21,2008-04-25 01:55:00,563,As a bass fisherman Im surprised you haven't already caught a pike.  I typically fish L.M. Bass and Walleye and I would say 3/5 trips I'm out I get a pike in the mix as well.
192099,Burning Babies,2008-04-25 02:12:00,150,"When fishing with an R bend spinnerbait and wire leader, add a small split ring to the bend before attaching the leader.  It will keep the leader from sliding up the wire and occasionally ruining a cast, or completely torquing the frame when you get a fish on."
192159,danbo,2008-04-25 10:50:00,2646,Black-skirted Buzzbaits work too. Zara Spook is another killer for shallow fish. Summer fish are deeper..good time to slow-roll 1oz Spinnerbaits or rip big Jigs near bottom.
192177,theRJ,2008-04-25 11:52:00,55,"Use a leader bigger then 40lbs. I have had a big pike shear clean through a 40 lb leader and It is not fun. Now I use an 80lb Fluoro Musky leaader and Have hooked 4 fish (2 shook off) without a single nick in it. As far as lures go, Minnowbaits work very well but never underestimate the power of the trusty old spoon.  Also consider large senko style baits.  RJ"
192191,FishHeadRic,2008-04-25 12:23:00,226,"I've had a pike bite thru 80 floro. It's the least I would go with the floro. Coated steel will work just fine but with the floro leaders you will avoid the kinks that you get with the steel leaders. Also DO NOT USE UNCOATED TITANIUM LEADERS!!! Pike will roll on ya and they cut right thru their skin! As far as lures go you can't beat Huskie Jerks or X-rapps. Twitch, twitch, pause my friend. Burning babies has a good point with the R bend spinners. I used to just slip a split ring over the little part the leader attaches to. (You can also just bend that part so that the two parts touch)  FHR"
