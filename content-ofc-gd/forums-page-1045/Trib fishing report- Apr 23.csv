Today my dad had to drop off a reel at Aikmans in Mississauga for servicing and what better opportunity to go for a walk on a couple western tribs?  Went for a short stroll at the Credit this afternoon and took a few drifts to dust off an old centrepin I rarely use now.  Didn’t spend too much time there but enjoyed just being beside the water and getting my daily dose of vitamin D.  I got a few nibbles from small river fish but didn’t land anything or hook into anything substantial.  A couple pics of the river  Fishing some pocket water   View upstream   Decided to stop in at the Humber river before heading back home. I only had an hour to fish it before we had to pick up my sister from work. The hour was worth it.  It’s been a rough 7 months since I last hooked into a fish, so when I saw that float go down I was ecstatic…My first fish of 2008 turned out to be a creek chub about the size of my hand – I didn’t take a pic.  I caught one more chub after that and finally caught something a little more substantial.    It took a small live trout worm under a float.  It didn’t fight particularly well nor was it very big, but at least it was a fish. From the looks of it, there weren’t many fish to be had in that stretch of river beyond chub and shiners - Most anglers weren't catching anything. A great day in general (weather wise) and I really enjoyed fishing both the Credit and Humber – It’s been about 3-4yrs since I fished either so it felt good getting reacquainted with both rivers after so long.  Now that I’m finally done university, I can concentrate more on my fishing – Especially getting back into steelhead.  Only 3 more sleeps till the opener…Can hardly wait."

191629,Fang,2008-04-24 01:37:00,1330,MJL  Walked the credit from Burnhamthorpe down today - armed with my camera looking for some nature  very suprised to see how low and clear the water had got in last 2-3 days. Almost looked like summer
191672,ccmtcanada,2008-04-24 03:26:00,7971,Good stuff MJL!  Getting that first one out of the way must have felt good.  Looking forward to your trout opener report....as well as the carp ones!
191673,Victor,2008-04-24 03:27:00,1609,isn't it great to get out after being in school for so long?  i didn't catch much last weekend when i went out for crappie as well but it was real nice being out there stress-free
191699,dsn,2008-04-24 09:12:00,1018,Awesome scenic shots.  I'm still feeding the carp they should be ready to go soon.  dsn
191716,MJL,2008-04-24 11:07:00,2427," When I first got there I was thinking the opposite...At least compared to some of the tribs I scouted last week.  In either case, some rain wouldn't hurt.  The summery weather was nice though and it sounded like the frogs were getting it on.   It's FREAKIN' GREAT!"
