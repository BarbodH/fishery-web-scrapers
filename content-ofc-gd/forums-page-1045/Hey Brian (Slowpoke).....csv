Lots of fun watching the giant container ships go by and dodging the waves they washed up.  I'm going Friday on the North Sea to do some ""wreck fishing"" for cod, pollack, and whatever else there is out there. I'll post some pictures when I get back if I have time before I take off for my brook trout adventure, but if not, expect to see some brookie pics as well.  jjcanoe with some wooden shoes"
