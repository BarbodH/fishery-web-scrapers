Maybe that is the case, maybe it isn't.  Anyways, Out of curiosity I clicked on FREECREDITREPORTINCANADA.COM or something of that nature (thinking it must be a legitimate site and not a bunch of Bull)  After doing everything it asked me to, still no credit report, and not a reasonable link to get to it, other than suggesting to go to Equifax.  I am kind of disappointed to see such a banner running on this site.  Andrew."

191942,Gerritt,2008-04-24 21:49:00,6129,"Andrew.... they (fr**cr*ditr*port.c*m) are a joke ... I have read about them on Multiple sites... they are a scam I hope you did not give CC info....    Having said that... Google ads are delivered by words mentioned here... it is called ad-sense.. you mentioning keywords such as you have above cred*t, equif*x, rep*rt etc etc etc are what generate these ads....  Ad-Sense banners are not generated by OFC...they are generated by the content of the posts...  Each time a user clicks one however... OFC is paid a few cents.  Hope this clears up any confusion about the google ads your seeing.  If I remember correctly OFC admin can control the type of ads shown.... and the one you mention is a scam. Just type fr**cr*ditrep*t.com scam into google..... replace the *'s ofcourse. and you will learn their evil ways...   G"
191947,Andrew,2008-04-24 22:06:00,54," I wasn't sure if that was the case or not, because I can't really recall seeing ads in the the past that were just total garbage.  I guess that going forward no one should be talking about the CREDIT river and it should become the CR*D*T river."
