191811,MJL,2008-04-24 15:39:00,2427,"Damn straight!  I've been looking forward to this weekend for the last 6-7 months.  For me the opener is like Christmas...Always has been, probably always will be.  This past week I spent tying flies, greasing a couple spinning reels, Re-spooling my fly and centrepin reels, sharpening hooks on my spinners and Kwikfish, etc.  2yrs ago I got severe withdrawal symptoms the day before the opener and wrote this:  ‘Twas the night before trout season and all through the house, Not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse. The waders and vests were put together with care In hopes that the steelhead would still be there.  Little Mikey was lying awake in his bed, While visions of steelhead danced in his head Johnny stroking his spey rod and Dad with his cap Dreaming of that moment when they could feel a fish’s hard tap  Too excited to sleep Mikey began to tie flies With many different patterns, nymphs, buggers and dries Marabou and chenille and a generous dosing of yarn Hoping that steelhead would succumb to their charm  There were leeches, muddlers, matukas and scuds Popsicles, clousers, Mickey-fins and glo bugs Wake-N-bakes, bombers and other various dries They all attract steelhead, from deep in their lies.  Johnny awoke, also too excited to sleep He rigged up his spey rods in which he could dredge the deep Sink tips and shooting heads and split shot galore No steelhead could hide even those hugging the floor  There were twelve rods together of all models and makes All back-ups in case, one of them breaks There were Thomas and Thomas, Loomis, St. Croix and Sage All of them beefy to control steelhead in rage  All of the rods could launch a wet Popsicle with ease Even in rain, or in a stiff breeze Eight weights, nine weights and a couple of tens Hoping they’ll be tested, by monstrous hens  Dad (a float fisherman) woke up to tie spawn Hoping to entice, a few fish at dawn Three salmon eggs placed in the center of the bag His recipe with fish scent makes anyone gag  Dad rigged up his float rod a Frontier 13 The rod had a black blank with guide wraps of green It was his beloved float rod in which he placed on his ‘pin An Islander Steelheader, a reel with great spin Not to be forgotten the spinners and spoons Cleos and Gibbs, Mepps, double loons Marabou jigs and some made of fur Hoping that steelhead would give them a stir  Finally dawn broke Mikey, Johnny and Dad jumped in the car Hitting the Notty which wasn’t too far Hoping the fish-gods would be on their side At the end of the day, they’ll be grinning with pride.  Happy and safe opener to all"

191815,urbanangler1990,2008-04-24 15:45:00,933,"thunderstorm, rain predicted? hmm"
191848,addict,2008-04-24 17:32:00,475,cant see understand all the hype about opener shoulder to shoulder low clear water and all the best fishing is done good luck to ya ill be fishing for crappy out in the boat with lots of fish and space between fishermen.
191853,douG,2008-04-24 17:54:00,2693,"As the French say, Chacun a son gout, which means Sore Big Toes for Everybody.  Pretty sure about that."
191858,Fang,2008-04-24 18:06:00,1330,Yeah it looks like my 21 stright years of same river for trout opener might be in jeopardy. Walked a bit of it this week and can't believe how low it is and ultra clear. No sign what so ever of even a drop back trout which is strange as there's a ton of wood and overhang in some stretches. Always end up seeing a few strays here.  Crappie fishing sounds better and better water is receding nicely through most of the kawarthas
191860,jdmls,2008-04-24 18:08:00,575,"  Not even a foot of snow is gonna keep me off the river this saturday...I hope it does rain saturday, just cause most of the ""1 time a year"" guys will stay home......GO HARD OR GO HOME is my modo.....Opening day is by far the best day of the year, and I sure can relate to how you feel about time going by soooo slow.....My buddies at work are sending me pics from last years opener just to cause more adrenalin !!! bunch of jerks !!!  URBAN...rain or shine get out and put a bend in that new HMX rod !!!"
191861,Bly,2008-04-24 18:12:00,1556,Love the poem MJL!  I am looking forward to you and your Dad's Opener report!  Best of luck to those heading out.
191875,young_one,2008-04-24 18:46:00,620,"All geared up today, got some flies, small colourful worms, and etc. Can't wait till my first opener  I wish to learn a lot from the shoulder to shoulder environment, perhaps I'll catch something if I get lucky."
191876,fish_finder,2008-04-24 18:46:00,370," I guess you don't explore too much eh??  I haven't seen anyone on opening day for years now.......of course, I steer well clear of any steelhead waters.  I've been fishing steelies for the last 6 months, time for the old 4wt to get a workout with browns and brookies!!!  Thats my opener...steelhead are open all year for the most part.  dave"
191893,addict,2008-04-24 19:37:00,475, i was refering to rainbow fishing never fished for brookies its not my thing.ive explored for rainbows some go really far north nary a person around but im not much for that style ultra finnesee overhanging trees sticks poking u in the face.i like to hit em when they first enter the river in the lower stretches where they fight better are less spooky and u can enjoy the battle rather than worry about that log jam.
