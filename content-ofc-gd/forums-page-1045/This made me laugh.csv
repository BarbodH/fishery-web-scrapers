189981,Radnine,2008-04-20 18:53:00,1538,"Hey! I loved it, thanks for posting. The sad thing is that I really enjoyed the song. Talk about ""hoping it doesn't come to this"", I am starting to like country more and more. I am also listening to CBC radio more than the FAN 590. My life is officially over. Soon kid, this whole forum will be living vicariously (look it up) through you. Donâ€™t let us down!!!"
189982,wacky tambaqui,2008-04-20 18:56:00,33,"Well I'm not a fan of country music by any means but that tune is a good catch  btw- I've been there, done it, and I didn't miss her that much.  "
190009,bassfighter,2008-04-20 20:42:00,366,"That song is a reality to some guys these days, and some men cannot even do what comes natural to them. It is funny and had a nice tune to it.  Why do some women makes men lives too complicated?  Can't live with them and can't live without them!"
190014,MCTFisher9120,2008-04-20 20:46:00,3761,"Good song, herd it before but never saw the video. Thanks for posting."
190016,danbo,2008-04-20 20:52:00,2646,Good one!
190086,Greencoachdog,2008-04-20 23:52:00,8163,"  You aint the only one Bubba!  ... I know for a fact I'd have missed my boat a helluva lot more!   When the Man of the House announces he's goin' fishin', the Woman of the House only needs to say one of two things... either, can I come with you... or, Go!   There's lots worse things a man can be doin' than sittin' on a Lake tryin to outsmart a critter with a brain the size of a matchhead!!!"
190120,LundGuy,2008-04-21 01:20:00,169,"Great find. I don't have that problem though, my wife is as much a part of my fishing as all other things in our life.Oh and she got a real kick out of the video too"
190159,Tinman,2008-04-21 02:38:00,376,Thats a great tune! Al of his songs are similar in humor too
190199,maybe,2008-04-21 06:24:00,307,"His new one ""  Nice range in his body of work...balancing the ultra-sappy love song with pickup lines like ""I'd like to check you for ticks.""  For more of the funny stuff, try ""(So Much Cooler) Online."""
190251,silveradosheriff,2008-04-21 12:29:00,1025,That's great - thanks for posting!
190366,cranks bait,2008-04-21 17:02:00,721,What makes this video even funnier is that it is his real wife with him in it.
190573,wacky tambaqui,2008-04-21 23:43:00,33," Rightly so! And I never refuse any ladie's request of ""can I come with you?"" I have plenty of spare rods for those occasions and she always gets a nice combo for the outing"
191188,smbhunter,2008-04-23 01:46:00,186,"LOL!!!  When my brother and his fiance first heard this song, I was the first thought that entered both of their minds. They both said they could see me doing that. I had to agree 100% with them. If a woman is going to make me choose, there is only one choice to be made, cuz she ain't the one for me."
191242,Sinker,2008-04-23 03:10:00,8692,This was one of our wedding songs  Sinker
191247,Musky or Specks,2008-04-23 03:35:00,2710,Yup excessive fishing was one of the complaints in my divorce proceedings. Dont miss having to ask thats for sure!!!!!!!!!!!
191277,Greencoachdog,2008-04-23 09:59:00,8163,"It's an evil Witch of a woman that would try to deprive a man of his fishing!!! The ones that try it should have all their shoes taken away and be made to go barefoot in winter, then take their purses and handbags away and make them carry a mans wallet!!!  That'd teach them!!!"
192103,wacky tambaqui,2008-04-25 02:17:00,33,"    WT's gf: ""Look, it's either our relationship or your fishing outings. It's one or the other.""  WT: [pulling out the rods, reels, and tackle box] ""That is a very easy decision to make.""  "
