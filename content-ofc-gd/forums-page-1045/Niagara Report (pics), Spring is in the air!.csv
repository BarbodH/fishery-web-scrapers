Upper River still has some ice floating around, That may find itâ€™s way below the Falls. The Weathers been really nice here in Niagara Falls, flowers are poppin up, Finally Winter is OVER!!!      Water temps are now 37 degrees. This is the beginning of some of the best steelhead fishing of the season! Fly Fishing on the Niagara will kick into high gear with these warmer temps. Walk and Wade adventures are at peak season.   Small roe bags, yarn flies and small minnow are producing fish for us.   See you on the River,  Cast Adventures"
