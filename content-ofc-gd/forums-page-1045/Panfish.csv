191504,super dave,2008-04-23 20:15:00,323,This may be a stupid question but is there a season for panfish?  I want to take my nephew for a couple of hours this weekend in the kawarthas.
191507,bassman,2008-04-23 20:33:00,384,"Not typically, but you'd better check the regs just in case."
191541,jeffw,2008-04-23 21:45:00,267,Panfish open in the kawartha's the last sat in april ( this sat). Cheers Jeff
191567,mikeh,2008-04-23 23:06:00,824,Will the water temps be good for the crappie to begin spawning this weekend? or is the water still too cold? just thought I'd ask since the Kawarthas opens for panfish this weekend.
191573,bassslinger,2008-04-23 23:27:00,21,"Panfish do open this weekend but not everywhere in the Kawartha`s due to walleye santuary restrictions, check your regs for the area you intend to fish."
191647,Joeytier,2008-04-24 02:18:00,3990,Go to Simcoe. Virginia Beach area has copious amounts of perch.
191652,Greencoachdog,2008-04-24 02:26:00,8163, Crappies typically spawn at 62*F water temp.
191706,Meely,2008-04-24 10:13:00,282,"I was out ""scouting"" (....no....I didn't fish for them....just looked for them) last weekend in the Kawarthas and noticed the Crappie had already moved in. There were not a whole wack of them around but the ones that were in the schools of panfish were nice slabs.  I'm anxiously awaiting for opener this Saturday.......2 more sleeps !!   Meely"
