191394,Fishmaster,2008-04-23 15:40:00,920,You Folks are in for some cool Cat Fishing TV Shows coming soon to TV. I spent the last few days setting up a few awesome Cat shows!  What a great time.  First I went off with the Boys from (Extreme Angler )Karl & Dave.  We were slamming huge cats from 18 to 20lbs ...  Thanks Guys for coming down to Dunnville  Extreme Angler Slide Show   This week Pete Bowman and his crew from Fish n Canada came out.  The fishing was tough at first but we managed to find some huge cats in deep water. Landing some over the 20lb range>  It was a blast fishing with you Pete and Mike I had a great time ...  Fish'n Canada Slide Show

191588,TangerineDream,2008-04-24 00:25:00,47,Good to see someone still promoting the big cats.... Tiring of all the ski's eyes and bucket mouths. There is another species worthy out there guys! Who knows.... maybe someone will break my record with one outta your waters... It's about time it happens... and someone else takes the reigns....  Nice work fishmaster.... They aren't the same as we see on t.v.  Been with several myself over the years.... Someone can always teach you something...  Maybe one day we can fish cats together.... How are they lately anyways?
