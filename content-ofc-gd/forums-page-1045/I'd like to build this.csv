191497,Bernie,2008-04-23 20:06:00,3190,"A buddy E-mailed this to me. I wonder if Gerritt, Joe and Bill will help me throw one together when they come up.  FLOATING GAZEBO I was going to build the Gazebo on the edge of my dock down by the lake but I thought ...I might just as well build the deck with floats on it and I can then take it out fishing too. Has 15,000# capacity. The deck is 18ft x 18ft with 12 plastic foam filled dock floats that are 4ft x 4ft by 18 inch. high. and the Gazebo is 10 ft. Hexago n with a table and chairs inside. Under the table is my trolling motor so I can take it out to my favorite fishing hole. The trolling motor is remote controlled wireless so I can be fishing outside and operate the motor. On the top of the table I have a LOWRANCE Fish-Finder with depth sounding sonars and temp gauge. I have 2 electric winches with 40# anchors. I have also built in a water pump so I can clean the fish right on the spot. Now I can relax and fish while my wife can sit and relax. "
191498,bpsbassman,2008-04-23 20:08:00,941,I've seen that before.  My Brother-in-law says he's going to build one Would be cool.
191502,cranks bait,2008-04-23 20:12:00,721,There is a guy near here that has done something like this with his pontoon boat.  It's got a nice wood railing.  Loaded with a kitchen table and a sofa.  I had to do a double take when I saw it.  Wish I got a picture.  I'll try and find him again this year.
191503,DanTheMan,2008-04-23 20:14:00,257,Thats pretty neat. I want one
191513,Reef Runner,2008-04-23 20:48:00,981,Wow.  That is wicked.  What an amazing craft to spend time with the family on.
191533,Maverick,2008-04-23 21:21:00,371,"Looks awesome, what do you do with it in the winter?"
191536,Gerritt,2008-04-23 21:29:00,6129,Well I have the tools and knowledge... lets get building!!!  G
191537,irishfield,2008-04-23 21:29:00,26272,Just remember.. if it has it's own motor it becomes a boat and has to meet all regs. But if you tie your tinny to the side and pull it around with that... it's just a barge.
191777,Headhunter,2008-04-24 13:56:00,5703,"""Just a couple of hours on a Saturday Bernie!"" Let's get 'er done! HH"
191916,wuchikubo,2008-04-24 21:00:00,1114,"That's cool, but I looks like it would be a bit of a pain to take out of the water at the end of the season."

192083,Bernie,2008-04-25 01:48:00,3190,Too many other projects to build something like this right now. But maybe in the future....... This summer I am overhauling an old dry boathouse into a sleep cabin....Need it to put Gerritt in. It will be far enough away Joe won't need to listen to  him snore.
192088,Gerritt,2008-04-25 01:52:00,6129,I blame the black russian fellow!  G
