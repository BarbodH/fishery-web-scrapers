192201,johnnyb,2008-04-25 12:56:00,3413,"Hey, I've been to Cat Island!  Did you stay on the island, or just take a charter down there to fish?  Awesome fishing down there....I only brought a lightweight rod and fished the tidal creeks...had some incredible action....even hooked one of those nice reef sharks!  Nice pics and thanks for sharing"
192237,Mike01,2008-04-25 13:53:00,378,"I was so pumped when the shark hit, we thought it was a marlin at first by the way it ran.  But soon enough we found out what it really was.  Towards the end I was getting really tired.  I have a friend who has a place down near Hawks Nest.  He has a deal worked out with them that he can use the facilities when he comes down.  Oh I almost forgot....GO BRONCOS!!!"
