191430,BFSC Kevin,2008-04-23 17:31:00,1351,"at this place is $25, plus you get two cards.. looks like a good time to get you card! http://www.theoperatorcard.ca/index.php?worldpay  i paid $40 and only got 1 card a year or two ago..   kevin"
191443,Stoty,2008-04-23 17:47:00,2910,"when is this ACTUALLY coming into effect? I got my card way back in like 1998 or 1999. They said ""ohh you better get it, its going to be mandatory"".  Yup...its been really useful the past 10 years!!!!!!  Yet another money grabbing scheme from our lovely gov't.  I am surprised they havent started the ""graduated boat licensing system"" yet."
191445,Stoty,2008-04-23 17:51:00,2910,(from operatorscard.ca)  Glad to know that they aren't making me re-do the test!!!
191446,tinbanger,2008-04-23 17:51:00,1028,anyone know how to get a replacement card  Have had mine about 8 years and its in 3 pieces!  tb
191456,Maverick,2008-04-23 18:09:00,371," If you contact the place where you got it with your card number, they should be able to issue you a new one. The site I got mine doesn't exist anymore so I'm not sure what you would do. I do believe that there was one site that bought a bunch of the others so you might have to call around if you can't find your site."
191474,POLLIWOGG,2008-04-23 18:59:00,835,"Our lovely gov. doesn't get any $ from operators cards.  Its against the rules to write the test at home, it looks like they're trying for one last kick at the can before they  shut down.  Some of these outfits kept records and some don't so make lots of copies of your card."
191485,carll2,2008-04-23 19:28:00,443,is this card good for quebec also?
191510,wallyboss,2008-04-23 20:40:00,1095,Yep it's Federal.
191525,Golfisher,2008-04-23 21:02:00,586,"That's a great deal!  I got mine from the same site about a month ago, but back then had to pay $35 plus."
191549,Gerritt,2008-04-23 22:09:00,6129,  Pisses me off... I just paid them 35.00 each (for two separate people) not long ago LOL  G
191554,Hookset,2008-04-23 22:34:00,367,"At this rate if I wait until Sept. 14, 2009 to get mine, they'll probably pay me to get the license.   Hookset."
191556,addict,2008-04-23 22:43:00,475,"what size boats need these.has anyone ever been stopped,is thier a fine.ive been driving boats for 17yrs now because a few stupid drunk seadoos im no longer qualified."
191608,Zubris21,2008-04-24 00:59:00,563,"Thanks for sharing,  don't have a boat yet, but hopefully in a couple years/ plus I rent and borrow friends regularly enough.  I'm going to try to jump on this offer if I can find the time in the next 2 weeks."
191612,danc,2008-04-24 01:09:00,4677,"I think that I'll just take a chance and not get one. I haven't been stopped by any authority in my boat ever. I'm still trying to figure out when my gun registration and POL is due, or if it in fact does come due, and if I have to pay for it or not. Screw them I say. If they want to fine me, so be it."
191627,kentooley,2008-04-24 01:32:00,208,I took some courses run by Canadian Power & Sail Squadrons back in the early 80's and fortunately I did some checking and only had to pay the cost of the card.
191656,Sinker,2008-04-24 02:52:00,8692,"  Atta boy Dan!!  I agree.  I broke down and did everything by the book though, but I can't afford to pay any fines, and I can't afford to lose my guns or hunting license.........and I don't need the hassles if it ever came down to it.  I've never been asked to see my boaters card, or my PAL. Just hunting fishing licenses. The only time the PAL is needed is to purchase ammo, or a new gun. Other than that, nobody wants to see it.  Just more rules to help the stupid people from hurting themselves.  Sinker"
