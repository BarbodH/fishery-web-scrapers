Eww and Yuk just don't describe it. But if P3TA wants to consider it good for them, it would help with the recycling of cardboard boxes and uses.  So some of them would consider road kill to be okay it seems. The first steps of bringing back some sensibility to some."
190383,Sinker,2008-04-21 17:19:00,8692, Whats wrong with roadkill?

190391,Canuck2fan,2008-04-21 17:35:00,1444,"Yep we are almost getting to the point now that some poor sod is going to have actually go clean the bio scrubbers..... Gene Roddenbarry was right.  That these clowns can even take this stuff seriously is alarming to say the least. Oh well, when one of them snaps their neighbours won't saying but they were so quiet and nice on the six o'clock news.... yadda yadda yadda.  Being the red neck hippie that I am I gave my vegan niece a t-shirt for Christmas this year that I had professionally printed. ""Eating meat is murder..... mmm... mmm tasty tasty murder"" which I admit I stole from a post I read on here a while back to the author I thank you!!!! The best part was she freaked out while I and everyone else in the family laughed ""with"" her not at her (which would have been cruel) because she used to eat meat just the same as the rest of the us neanderthals, until the other workers at the vet where she worked talked her into being a vegan. As a gag gift that only cost me 7.95 shipped right to my door I have to say it is the little inexpensive things in life that give us the most pleasure."

They had an entire website geared towards kids and teaching them how hooking a baby fish is no different then hooking your baby brother.  Like come on, are they serious?  This is a very very evil organization which can be very persuasive to those that are uninformed"
