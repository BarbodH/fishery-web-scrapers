191949,Victor,2008-04-24 22:10:00,1609,"hey everyone  I fired up my 1.5hp Johnson motor today to test it out and warm it up. During the process I noticed that fuel is leaking into the bucket of water where i was testing the motor. I brought the motor out once last year and it did the same thing before i got it to start so i didn't end up using it for the whole last year. It seems that whenever the prop turns (when i pull on it the motor to start it) some fuel comes out ... it wasn't substantial but i didn't think that is normal either  The motor is a 1956 1.5 horse johnson. It ran smoothly though other than the leaking problem, in fact i'm not sure if it is a problem or not   .    One more thing... there's two knobs on the motor which says ""high speed and low speed"" ... and it has labels saying ""lean/rich"" depending which way i turn it... does anyone know what those knobs do? When i get my photobucket up and running again i'll try to post a pic.  Thanks in advance!  Victor  p.s. good luck to all this coming panfish/trout opener!"
191989,addict,2008-04-24 23:25:00,475,fuel leaking sounds like a seal is gone as for the controls set it to rich for a slower idle and lean will let er rev higher and go a little faster.
