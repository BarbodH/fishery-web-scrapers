192049,Pigeontroller,2008-04-25 00:59:00,2793,You need to get a copy of the regs! There are different opening dates for different zones!
192079,Zubris21,2008-04-25 01:45:00,563,"Its astonishing how many people ask when openers are...  You can pick up a regs book at any tackle shop, Most Canadian Tires and wal-marts.  Just find your zone and check the opening dates.  Don't forget to look for your particular water body on the exceptions list because even within one particular zone regulations can be different.  Heck many lakes and rivers have sanctuaries which are closed all year.  In addition to the opening and closing dates make sure you are aware of the possession (number of fish you can keep) and slot limits (size of fish you can keep) because these can get you in just as much trouble as fishing out of season.  Heres a link to the regs.  its a good think to get familiar with  http://www.mnr.gov.on.ca/en/Business/LetsF...L02_163615.html"
