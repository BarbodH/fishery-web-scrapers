192011,issamhay,2008-04-25 00:02:00,77,so you can't fish lake trout on Simcoe during the spring and summer?
192013,MCTFisher9120,2008-04-25 00:05:00,3761,I'll tell u what is open and closed one min.
192014,MCTFisher9120,2008-04-25 00:06:00,3761,Lake Trout in zone 16 is open January 1st to September 30th
192016,irishfield,2008-04-25 00:08:00,26272,You can fish Lakers from the 2nd Sat in May until Sept 30th... on Simcoe. As well as Jan 1st to Mar 15th.  EDIT... Be carefull Mike... be absolutely sure to read the EXCEPTIONS for the lake you are going to fish.
192018,MCTFisher9120,2008-04-25 00:10:00,3761,R u sure cause the regulation that i said up there says jan1 to sept 30
192019,Beans,2008-04-25 00:11:00,3339, Rookie mistake...Always read the exceptions...
192020,irishfield,2008-04-25 00:11:00,26272,Read the exceptions.. Find Lake Simcoe and read what it says. NO Muskie fishing... reduced Laker and whitefish seasons etc.

192115,Sinker,2008-04-25 02:41:00,8692,I pretty much only look at the exceptions anymore. They are a MUST READ for every body of water.......doesn't matter what the general open seasons are........read the exceptions for the body of water your fishing!!!!!  Sinker
