191692,bassmastermike,2008-04-24 05:20:00,295,Well folks the time is getting closer and i dont see much talk about Lakair as i did last year. Not sure what the plans are for this year if any. Last year was great and hope to repeat the memories  great times and hopefully meet a few new friends. This is just a feel for what people are planning if anything. Cheers BMM.
