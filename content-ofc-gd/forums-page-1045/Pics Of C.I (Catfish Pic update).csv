191280,dsn,2008-04-23 10:09:00,1018,"     Look at the water level in this pic above. Those who fish the island know that those steps of concret are usually above water level.  Because of the water level, it's taking a bit longer to warm up.   I warned her not to lay her eggs there but ""NO......."" They don't listen. And we are do for rain or a thunderstorm today.  dsn  Heres the catfish pic I found it. "

191349,capt bruce,2008-04-23 13:33:00,820,"I will be giveing away my age but my first job was working on the island putting those steps in . We had huge piles of old sidewalk from the digging of the subway etc. and we  cut them up and made those lagoons. was a great job paid 2.30 an hour. lol long time ago  ,shows you how strong those old sidewalks were  that there still there 40 odd years latter, try that with the crap they use for sidewalks now ."
191407,dsn,2008-04-23 16:24:00,1018, Yeah I saw one about a foot long... it was in really bad shape. Must had very rough s_x. It had some damage on the head and a damage on the tail end. They both appeared white looking down through the water.  dsn
191409,dsn,2008-04-23 16:27:00,1018, Yeah they don't build stuff the way they used anymore. All cheap stuff they use. No matter what they build these days.  $2.30 an hr huh? 50-60 yrs young.  I was making $4.25 in a grocery store so you must be slightly ahead of me.    dsn

191516,007,2008-04-23 20:50:00,537,"Hey DSN,  Nice photos - like SNAG er SNAP says wishing I could be down there.  Good to hear the water levels are up this year.  Last year the water levels were so low it caused us shore anglers some trouble, so glad you guys won't have the same problem this year.  Good news is I'm looking into the possibility of taking a holiday in late August/early September to go back across the pond and do some fishing at the islands and other favourite places in Ontario. Maybe I'll see you out there.  007"
191520,Golfisher,2008-04-23 20:56:00,586, That's the price you pay when you get into S&M.  LOL.
