191789,evster,2008-04-24 14:36:00,367,"I am right in the middle of finishing up an old boat trailer to make use of it this year.  I am in need of a couple square u-bolts but i'm having trouble finding them.  I tried the big name stores (Canadian Tire, Rona, Home Depot, Home Hardware) but they all have like 3 different sizes, none of which will work for me.  Anyone know of a specific store in my area (Waterloo) or the types of stores that tend to carry these things?  I'd have to check the measurements again but I think i'm looking for one that is 3 inches wide and 5 inches long, and is 1/4 diameter.  Any help is much appreciated.  Thanks! Evan"
