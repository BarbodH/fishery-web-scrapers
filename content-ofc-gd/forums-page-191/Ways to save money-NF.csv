What they don't tell you is 80% of that 90 is unpaid internships, contracts, seasonal and filling leave of absence positions.

The road that some take by going to college was not a path I wanted at the age of 18. I went into the Seabees a branch of the Navy and came out a plumber. Between working hard and a few classes to further my education I escaped the debt that college places on our youth. A driving ambition got me to the point of starting my own company 20 years ago and it has become a secure world for me.

897887,Mister G,2015-02-13 16:47:00,1429,"As Terry says, don't use credit cards, pay cash for everything and if you don't really need something, don't buy it. I do quite the opposite.........I pay almost EVERYTHING with a credit card and of course I pay it off in full when the bill arrives. However, I get either points or money back using those credit cards which you do NOT get using cash. Also if there is a problem with a product, especially a large ticket item the credit card company will help you when the retailer or manufacture is stonewalling you.  I also buy things I don't need right now ""IF"" it's on sale and I can store it for the near future. I almost never purchase anything that is not on sale, including gasoline."

It chews people up and spits them out. The work legislation is different out there. Legally they can work you 24 days straight, 12 hours a day. Then they have to give you 4 days off before they send you right back out again. Most oil companies do 10 days on 10 off which isn't bad, but those 10 days you live at the oil camps. Eat, sleep and live away from friends and family. For small stints this isn't bad but if you have kids or loved ones it can be taxing over the years. Sadly I knew a few people who's relationship ended because of the strain.  I guess I'm spouting off nonsense about wanting my cake and eating it too, but in life, the one thing I can't buy is time. I want to spend as much of it with my family as possible before I no longer have that opertunity."

If I really want to get cheap, I just go downstairs and fill from the sandpoint.  I realize there are the ones who have horrible ground water, but you can save a lot there. You can get  rid of that nasty chlorine taste for FREE (my favorite four letter word) by just pouring a glass of water and let it sit out for a few hours. The chlorine will just dissipate on it's own."

897216,rob v,2015-02-10 20:29:00,535,simple solution for most people - live within your means.  but sometimes hard to do  given today's society norms.  trick is to find a balance that suits you -  life is meant to be lived - but wasting your money and spending more than you should can make life very difficult.

I just had to remove some of the dead stuff from his back lot that he wants to expand.. turns out that it was all red oak. I just renewed my mortgage at the lowest rate the bank will give me and all my credit cards are paid off. Of course my long suffering wife would like a real vacation for once so I better start saving....
897218,lew,2015-02-10 20:39:00,12766, Wife and I go out for dinner EVERY Friday night without fail.  There's around 12-15 restaurants we have on our list and we kinda rotate them on a regular basis. Sometimes it's an in-expensive Chinese buffet and other nights it'll be prime rib with all the fixins & wine.  It's a great night out and the Mrs. calls it date night LOL.  Sometimes it's just the 2 of us and other nights there may be 10 of us but it's always good and well worth whatever the heck the cost is.

Plus this way of life teaches our kids alot. And gives them far greater odds at not only succeeding in life but also to take care of themselves and others if need be, IMO it breeds a better person.

Living in the GTA, parking is always a big waste of money to me. I typically park almost a KM from my office and walk in rather than spending the $7 a day for parking near the office. Exercise is good too!  I always look for deals on groceries. There are several sites out there that will tell you all the best deals on groceries, not to mention special credit cards that give you rewards such as the PC Mastercard - although as mentioned above, staying away from credit cards is probably a better idea!) I always wait for sales on stuff I need/want from places like Canadian tire you can often save over 50%  I also save a few bucks making my own spinner baits - and occasionally selling them.  One of my favourite fishing related tips is making sure you use the right gear for the job - this is particularly important with pike and muskie fishing. With the wrong gear you will be replacing those $20-30 lures way to often! I rarely ever lose lures since I beefed up my line/reels/rods several years ago."

Saves us a LOT on the monthly grocery bill, not buying unnecessary items. We would easily spend 200-300 a week on groceries, with a lot of the frozen goods being tossed in the garbage after freezer burn etc. or running out last minute for items and not buying on sale...  We look at the flyers and what's on sale and base our weekly meal plan off those item on sale.  We have cut our monthly grocery bill almost in half buy shopping  for only what is needed to make our meals for the week.  It also stopped the ""what should we have for supper tonight?"" And running to the grocery store to buy all the items needed.  It has saved us a ton!  We also only do laundry, run the dishwasher etc during off peak hours.  Mostly hand wash but sometimes we use it when company is over.  We have lowered the temp on our hot water tank. I don't need scalding hot water to have a shower.  We have cut cable and our home phone. Who needs a landline when we both have cells.  Pay in cash. We both have credit cards... They are barely used, if I don't have the $$$ now we can't afford it.

Why in hell would I pay $14/ lb for steaks when I know they're gonna be on sale for 6.99 soon.  If I'm wanting a steak BBQ & nothing on sale I buy a cheaper cut of beef.  Nothing wrong with top sirloin.  2 years ago I received info about a credit card which pays me 1% back on all my purchases.  Jan 4 they credited me with $265.00 for my last years purchases!!  Also entitles me to many other bonuses Free safety deposit box free roadside assistance - applies to both myself & my wife & covers ANY vehicle we may be driving - even other peoples vehicles! No annual fee No monthly bank fees - I used to pay $14.95/ month Free collision coverage when renting a vehicle Make sure my card is paid in full or 19.9% interest such as most other cards. If you need a tool wait for CTC flyer - guaranteed that particular tool will be 1/2 price shortly! I agree with Ironmaker - if paying interest on a loan for a toy -sell it. Irish says we're old dinosaurs - speak for yourself! LOL!  Bet I'm older than you & better looking LMAO! If you require a large item - get a line of credit on your house - interest is usually around 2.9%.  Regular bank loan interest on recreational vehicles is usually around 7%.

Rent your cottage out to winter tenants. Once we paid the mortgage the cottage is now free...there rent cheques cover all our costs and then some.  Go garage saling. Pretty much everything in the cottage was a garage sale find....and lots of tools and other things at home too. Couldn't begin to add up all the money we have saved over the years doing this. Plus you meet some interesting folks while  sipping your morning coffee and looking for treasures.  Get a PC Financial MasterCard and only use it to purchase groceries....the points add up...about $250-$300 a year...which we then spend in May when we move into the cottage and have to buy everything for the fridge bathroom and laundry supplies etc etc... just the same as all you folks that move back into your trailers every spring.  Check the grocery flyers every week for deals. Also do your regular shopping at No Frills or similar. Used to go to a Loblaws because it was closest. Big mistake. Far more $$$ for everyday items...it all adds up. I however can not endorse price matching. I think it's the most inconsiderate thing a person can too to the poor souls stuck behind you in line. I may be cheap....but I refuse to be THAT person.  Make your own booze. We do wine both white and red. $4 a bottle compared to the $10-$15 or more a bottle that we used to spend. Our white is really good. We have got used to the red.  Make your own coffee at home and pack a lunch for work...You just saved a minimum of $30 a week right there.  The next big one is go back to being a one car household when we retire. I want to give it a shot...Debbe not so much. We will see how that one plays out.

I used to be a pop fiend so we save alot on that just by drinking tea instead  a few years back we all stopped drinking milk. I occassionally use almond milk for cooking but no milk saves alot especially for us.  freeze, pickle, canning saves tonnes, just requires some time.  we bought shares in a farm. Best purchase ever!$750 got us easily 2-3000 in meat and fresh herbs and produce. Plus they taught us how to can and are just a great family to deal with.  my wife makes homemade toothpaste and its awesome, same with balms etc.  we cook from scratch 95% of the time. With that comes buying in bulk.  i try to drive and mukti task. If I need to go to hockey with my son, thats when I drop off garbage and shop or whatever.  no cleaning supplies in our house at all. Just vinegar and water.  we fill our water jugs for free at a relatives house.  use leftover fish or animals for dog food. I cant hunt(no PAL yet) but my wifes cousin always drops off a couple deer per year. All the scrap feeds the dogs. We process the deer ourselves.  Buy bulk flour. You would be amazed how many things you can make with flour.  learn to bake bread. Its amazing anyhow and very cheap. I can make 2 loafs of bread for probably 30 cents.  i keep my heat off during the day. Doesnt bother me one bit.  Make your own sauces, they taste better anyhow  live within your means. With cash. ""My dad once told me to keep your bills within one weeks pay, thats what you can afford""  Another good one that may take time to pay off but will one day, never hesitate to help people in your community. One day itll come back and save you. Make friends with skilled tradesman lol, if your an idiot like me. Got a plumbing issue call your bud lol, invite him over for a beer and supper.
