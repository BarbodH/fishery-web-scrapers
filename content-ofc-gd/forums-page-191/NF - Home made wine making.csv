898961,anders,2015-02-19 01:55:00,1168,"I am about to make wine for the first time, and my wife's uncle told her to be careful of a few things.  First off, she is pregnant with number 2 and i know there will be a smell associated with the process, but how bad will the smell be and will it actually have an effect?  The comments kind of worried her, this with her hesitations of me doing this, isn't boding well for me.  She doesn't want the house smelling like a winery for 2 months.  I remember my dad making wine when i was young, but never remember a strong smell, only when he was transferring to the carboy's or bottling.  Thanks  "

899247,manjo39,2015-02-20 15:31:00,354,"The aroma that TheLeetAngler mentioned that occurs early in the fermentation is predominantly from fermentation with grapes/skins.  If fermenting from juice, it isn't detectable unless your close.  As long as your wife is not in the same room she shouldn't smell it at all if using juice.  If you want to use grapes/skins, we do the first fermentation in the garage using heaters in the warmer fall season."
