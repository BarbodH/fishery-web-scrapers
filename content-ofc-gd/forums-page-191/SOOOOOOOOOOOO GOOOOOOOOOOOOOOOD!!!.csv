898561,Steve,2015-02-17 02:01:00,2075,looks like whole wheat buns and a nice healthy piece of fish....  nothing remotely unhealthy about that!

898620,misfish,2015-02-17 14:27:00,29133,"You must be sick,theres only two.  Nicely lightly battered. PERFECT."
898635,John,2015-02-17 15:35:00,2956,Looks awsome but I would get rid of the cheese and add a tiny bit of mayo and a splash of lemon....
898636,Joey,2015-02-17 15:42:00,9122,Now that just looks so tasty!!!   I may have to make some of my own

898700,DRIFTER_016,2015-02-17 21:59:00,10439,"melt the cheese next time, looks yummy for the tummy  It was well melted by the time I bit into it. Thought about toasting the bun but it was too much work."
898706,206,2015-02-17 22:42:00,563,No Tartar ?
898715,DRIFTER_016,2015-02-17 23:19:00,10439,"Nope, don't like that goo. Did put some malt vinegar on though. I think they would taste good topped with my slaw too."
898766,Sinker,2015-02-18 01:49:00,8692,"Fresh halibut is on my bucket list. When I do catch one, I might not be able to resist the urge to take a bite of it while its still moving lol   S."
898770,Steve,2015-02-18 01:59:00,2075,"hahahaha love it Sinker. i can totally imagine you doing that as well.  this thread made me drool.  Today for lunch I had some ""fresh"" halibut from a ""nice"" restaurant.  Not so good.  But hey, I tried, lol."
898964,Moosebunk,2015-02-19 01:58:00,3970,"Fresh halibut is on my bucket list. When I do catch one, I might not be able to resist the urge to take a bite of it while its still moving lol  Probably the best fish EVER!!!  Dave, my tuna melts for supper tonight didn't even come close to that scrumptiousness."
898973,solopaddler,2015-02-19 02:55:00,8605,"Nope, don't like that goo.  This little clip popped to mind  "
