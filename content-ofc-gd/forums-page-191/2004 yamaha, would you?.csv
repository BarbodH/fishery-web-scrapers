898399,Can_38,2015-02-16 14:26:00,152,"Looking to replace my current outboard and came across this, http://www.mobilemarine.com/products/994 .  Any one care to share thoughts or concerns?  I'm in search of a 4 stroke 40 or 30 hp to replace my 1994 2 stroke."
898404,wormdunker,2015-02-16 14:36:00,1711,"Yammy is a solid motor.  I'm not well versed on pricing for a 40 hp.  I can tell you I put a brand new 20 hp, 4 stroke, elec start on my 14' Lund last summer - $3600.00. Motor is awesome!"
898409,lookinforwalleye,2015-02-16 15:22:00,4399,Pricing I can`t comment on but I ran a Yamaha before my current Optimax and the Yamaha is a fine motor no issues!
898414,lew,2015-02-16 15:44:00,12766,I've got a 2009 150 Yamaha & it's great.  Nothing to offer on an '04 though.
898417,Pigeontroller,2015-02-16 16:05:00,2793,Yamaha 4 strokes are solid motors. Be interesting if they could tell you the hours on it...Not sure on price but I bet they would come down a bit..Go for it!
898418,Can_38,2015-02-16 16:15:00,152,I asked the same question on the hours.  Was told its a carburated model and therefore hours are unknown.
898419,grizzlybri,2015-02-16 16:17:00,565,I'm in search of a 4 stroke 40 or 30 hp to replace my 1994 2 stroke.  I'm no expert when it come to motors but i have a bit of knowledge and i know people that know there stuff. Just wondiner what is the make of your current one is it also a Yamaha
898420,Can_38,2015-02-16 16:24:00,152,"Current is a 1994 Force by Mercury.  Runs good and pushes my 16' legend to 30mph but I'm looking for a quieter, less exhaust and fuel efficient 4 stroke.  Not brand loyal simply looking for any motor that meets my needs within my price budget."
898423,grizzlybri,2015-02-16 16:28:00,565,"ok ill ask the the person i know, and see what they have to say. unfortunately they aren't on the forum"
898433,Steve,2015-02-16 16:57:00,2075,"the seller is correct.  the carb outboard doesn't show hours.  my first yamaha was a 1998 carb (50hp four stroke). I had it for 10 years of pure abuse before she waved the white flag.  I immediately replaced her with a 2008 efi yamaha (60hp four stroke), and it has been smooth sailing ever since.  In 2018 I'll likely replace the one I have now, for another.  All the while the 1998 Lund Pro Guide keeps kicking."
898440,FishAbout,2015-02-16 17:26:00,106,"Mobile marine are good people to deal with.  Most motors from around Huntsville, Muskoka area are used at the cottage and not used much. Ask what kind of boat it came off of also. They may be able to work on price a bit. Price seems fair though."
898445,porkpie,2015-02-16 17:56:00,2521,"As long as the motor checks out, i'd say it's a good upgrade to a 1994 force.   Price doesn't seem too out there, I'm sure they'd negotiate a bit."
898464,woodenboater,2015-02-16 18:56:00,2277,hope the motor is still for sale if you pull the trigger. I've seen enough people burned when they posted links asking for advice
898479,Steve,2015-02-16 20:40:00,2075,woodenboater is correct.  that price is MORE THAN FAIR at the asking price.  don't be surprised if your advertising on here garnered some interest.  many merc and omc users on this board looking to upgrade to a yammy.
898515,mike rousseau,2015-02-16 23:00:00,4661,"I sold a 2001 honda 40hp 4stroke tiller 3 years ago (so it was the same age as the one your looking at)  I got $3,000 for it...  The link isn't working for me so I can't comment on this particular motor or the price..."
898523,Steve,2015-02-16 23:23:00,2075,"$3K is the selling price.  again, more than fair price."
898528,Can_38,2015-02-16 23:55:00,152,"If it goes before I pull the trigger then it wasn't meant to be, I'll still sleep at night."
898529,mike rousseau,2015-02-16 23:57:00,4661,Fair for both parties then...  If you talk him down any you'll be getting a good deal...
898767,Sinker,2015-02-18 01:53:00,8692,"Yep thats a fair price, but you should really try and find a fuel injected model. Soooo smooth. If my engine ever decides to quit (93 yamaha built 40hp mariner) thats what I will be bolting on the back of my starcraft.  S."
898815,doubleheader,2015-02-18 12:55:00,497,I came across this site yesterday and they have a number of leftover small Yammies on sale. Thought maybe someone would be interested as I think they are in or around Buffalo.  http://www.ballantynerv.com/inventory.php?vehicletype=RV&condition=New
898875,Can_38,2015-02-18 19:24:00,152,"Yep thats a fair price, but you should really try and find a fuel injected model. Soooo smooth. If my engine ever decides to quit (93 yamaha built 40hp mariner) thats what I will be bolting on the back of my starcraft.  S. You are correct.  After all of the 'other' fees (controls, cables, prop, etc) and install the price tag jumps beyond my budget.  I have decided to save for another year and start my search again for a fuel injected 4 stroke next year."
