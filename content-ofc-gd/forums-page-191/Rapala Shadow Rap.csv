898655,Garry2Rs,2015-02-17 18:01:00,1425,Here's a link to Rapala's new suspending Jerk-bait...  http://enews.rapala.com/q/_8n4pjRfAPVT2XnjKxObVmrTHe48OxIUIZk8OF9MJ2P9SMDQUBTkkAh-8
898659,manitoubass2,2015-02-17 18:16:00,11391,"Great, another lure to try lol.  Ghost shiner and clown will be mine to try  Anyone try the scatter rap concept yet?"
898661,porkpie,2015-02-17 18:19:00,2521,"I love suspending jerkbaits, but if it costs much more than an $8 husky jerk I think I'll pass."
898662,manitoubass2,2015-02-17 18:22:00,11391,"I noticed their prices creeping up.  Used to be 9 or 10 bucks for any rapala. Now i find many at 15 and i forget the name, another jerk bait at 20 bucks"
898663,Acountdeleted,2015-02-17 18:24:00,2562,"I'd like to see a video of what it does. Gotta agree though, may be an overpriced jerk bait. Has anyone used the scatter raps?"
898672,porkpie,2015-02-17 19:40:00,2521,"No scatter rap, but I did find a bunch of clackin raps in a clearance bin at canadian tire last winter (wonder if it was a mistake?). I got em for $6 each, and absolutely pounded pike, smallmouth and even quite a few pickerel on them.  Quality bait , but I think full price is close to $14.  To rich for my blood!  Hopefully l'll be able to make the half doz I bought last.  I'm even using them through the ice.  I see they came out with a clacking rap stick bait now.  Maybe I'll get lucky and find some of them in a clearance bin$"
898678,manitoubass2,2015-02-17 20:30:00,11391,They retail at 10.  Cool story though.  I bumped into al linder years back when he was prefishing the fort frances bass championships.  We were both fueling up and my son was hyped to meet al. I think he was around 6 at the time. Clackin raps were brand new. In fact im not even sure they were in stores yet.  My son talks to al about his strategy which was hilarious in its own right. Al gives me a pat on the back and grabs a box outta his boat and hands it to my son.  There was aboit 100 clackin raps in there.  My son was sooooo happy(as was i)  Al is a class act
898686,porkpie,2015-02-17 21:18:00,2521,"They list for $15 at canadian tire which is the one of the few places that sell tackle near me.  Husky jerks are 10-11$  When I hit lebarons the odd time, I go hog wild on $7 husky jerks!"
898688,BassMan11,2015-02-17 21:26:00,583,Scatter Raps are great....  They have a really neat darting out to the side action at the right retrieval speed. Great for trolling and casting. I had a ton of success with the minnow types in Nakina last year for both Pike and Eyes. SAIL has them for $10.99 a pop in Ottawa.   Rapala Scatter Rap® - YouTube  fast forward to 1:30.
898704,Garry2Rs,2015-02-17 22:35:00,1425,"Three things: 1: As Bassman said, the Scatter Rap works quite well. On a straight retrieve, it suddenly and randomly darts off line, then returns to a normal course. The one problem I saw was they didn't come in a Pike size model.  2: Scatter Rap's are Balsa, this new bait looks like Plastic to me.  They list at $8.99 at Tackle Warehouse (plus 20% and shipping for Canadians.) and comes in a shallow and a deep version.  This new bait is 4.25 inches long and weighs 7/16th. oz.  3: This name says it suspends but is in fact it appears to sink very slowly and is supposed to shimmy as it does... Here's the hype... Living in the shadow world between life and death, the Rapala Shadow Rap combines both the vertical and horizontal struggles that a minnow exhibits when its life hangs in the balance. Sculpted with flat-sides, the Rapala Shadow Rap delivers an erratic darting action with minimal forward movement, so it can maintain the dance of death within a fish’s strike zone.Internally, the Rapala Shadow Rap is equipped with a fixed weighting system, which works like a minnow’s swim bladder, allowing it to sink with a slow-falling quiver – just like a dying baitfish. As it fades into the depths, the Rapala Shadow Rap snaps back to life with a flickering lunge that causes fish to come absolutely unglued."
898721,grizzlybri,2015-02-17 23:33:00,565,I like it but have other lures ahead of this to purchase
898726,EC1,2015-02-17 23:47:00,930,"From watching the videos, my understanding is that this finally caught on to the Japanese jerkbaits in terms of that side to side roll or ""shiver"" at the end of a twitch. I'm not too sure I buy the entire it'll slowly shimmy down as it sinks deal because it'll need to shrink pretty fast and that defeats the purpose of a suspending jerkbait. At $10, I guess it's cheaper than a pointer."
898733,Steve,2015-02-18 00:05:00,2075,"i'm sure it'll have garbage split rings and hooks like typical rapala baits.  at least when you buy a Yozuri, which costs 4 bucks more, it'll have top of the line split rings and hooks."
898768,MCTFisher9120,2015-02-18 01:54:00,3761,"Husky jerks shouldn't be more than $7.99 otherwise your paying way to much. We ordered some Shadow Rap's they should be in by the end of the month. It was neat seeing the action of that bait in the test pool. When twitching it on slack line it almost turns completely around and will start down the bass, sits tail up head down. I was impressed, I would guess it will be 9.99-11.99 it's $9 on TackleWarehouse.  It will be a good collator jerk bait, it was super slow but it didn't seem to rise more than a inch or 1 after 20+ seconds in the pool. Regardless it does have a wide 1-1.5ft dart and when worked aggressively it did full turn arounds."
898803,fishindevil,2015-02-18 10:22:00,6254,I hope it's as good as or better than the xrap they are my go to rapala jerkbait !!!! They work awesome and catch smallies & Wally's very well !!!so I will be aquiring my usual assortment if different colors to try out !!!!! Fish-on !!!!! :-))
898874,BillM,2015-02-18 19:21:00,17367,I love X-Raps.. We'll see how good these things look in the water..
898879,BassMan11,2015-02-18 19:30:00,583,"Three things: 1: As Bassman said, the Scatter Rap works quite well. On a straight retrieve, it suddenly and randomly darts off line, then returns to a normal course. The one problem I saw was they didn't come in a Pike size model.   I agree on the larger size for Pike but believe me they do work for them. This was caught on a chartreuse minnow version.  "
898882,manitoubass2,2015-02-18 19:47:00,11391,"More proof pike will bite anything you can throw at them lol.  My biggest pike came in 2fow on a jig and berkley ripple shad 4"" firetiger color. Was the best bite ive ever experienced!"
898891,BassMan11,2015-02-18 20:34:00,583,"More proof pike will bite anything you can throw at them lol.  My biggest pike came in 2fow on a jig and berkley ripple shad 4"" firetiger color. Was the best bite ive ever experienced! I actually did have trouble catching pike on a larger baits up there. They wanted a bite size snack because of the cold water temps I assume.  But I agree they usually will hit anything."
898892,manitoubass2,2015-02-18 20:38:00,11391,"Yip.  What was the measurement on that beauty slimeball? 41-42""?"
898968,BassMan11,2015-02-19 02:31:00,583,"Naw.  A good hold on my part lol. 39""  Never did get my 40. Hopefully next year when I head back up that way."
898977,manitoubass2,2015-02-19 03:25:00,11391,Geez that is a good hold!  I actually thought I was short changing ya.  Beautiful fat fish regardless!!!
898979,AdamS,2015-02-19 03:40:00,161,That shadow rap does look like an interesting bait... I'll probably give one a try this year. I agree with the other posters on the scatter rap. I like the erratic action and it works good on bass.
898995,singingdog,2015-02-19 11:40:00,1047,"A jerkbait that shimmys on the pause, and can turn 180 on a good snap?....congrats to Rapala for producing a LC Pointer copy 10 years after the fact"
899021,Mister G,2015-02-19 14:12:00,1429,They retail at 10.  Cool story though.  I bumped into al linder years back when he was prefishing the fort frances bass championships.

There was aboit 100 clackin raps in there.  My son was sooooo happy(as was i)  Al is a class act I must agree. Years ago I met both Al Linder and Dave Csanda and they are both gentlemen in every respect. Complete opposite of Babe Winkelman.
