898134,Fisherpete,2015-02-14 21:37:00,1814,"I'm a newbie to the HDS world... If I have two units on the boat, front and back, what is required (or is it possible) to do the following:  1) Share GPS/waypoint info 2) Share one transducer (will likely go with 2, transom and trolling motor but just curious) 3) Share one Navionics map chip 4) Transfer my waypoints and trails from my Elite-5 unit to the HDS units  Thanks guys  Pete"
898139,dracokaos,2015-02-14 22:11:00,116,"I was just at Radioworld and was speaking to sales regarding these very questions. First, you can't network Elite and HDS units. You can network HDS units together and they will share waypoints. If I remember correctly the gen 2 HDS units can transfer and share one transducer.  cheers"
898213,ecmilley,2015-02-15 13:15:00,2163,Ethernet cable is all thats required are u running gens 2 or touch screens?
898228,Fisherpete,2015-02-15 15:47:00,1814,Both are gen 1 units... Ethernet is the yellow cable?  Thanks Pete
898267,Wolf 3,2015-02-15 18:24:00,134,Both are gen 1 units... Ethernet is the yellow cable?  http://radioworld.ca/ethext-15yl-p-6416.html  You will need a map chip for each unit if you want to have the detail of the nav chip on both units.
898269,Fisherpete,2015-02-15 18:40:00,1814,"Been doing a bunch of reading today.  From what I understand, linking the two GEN 1 units with the ethernet cable will allow the two units to do the following: I may go the single transducer route. My trolling motor (Motorguide Wireless 45) is a PITA to hook up a transducer cable because of the way the shaft slides thru a collar when you stow/deploy it - you can't attach the transducer cable very well to it. If anyone has managed to come up with a solution for this I'm all ears - or if anyone knows if I could upgrade my trolling motor head to have a transducer built in, even better! I am going to call Rocky's in Orillia on Tuesday to see if he can do this and what it would cost.  Thanks for all the help, keep it coming!  Pete"
898302,Lunkerhunter,2015-02-15 21:24:00,455,Get a terrova and sell the motor guide. Hahahaha. Then you are all set
898325,Fisherpete,2015-02-15 22:24:00,1814,I'll start shopping a kidney around Andy... Would love to hop up to 24V 70lb Terrova with all the bells and whistles. Probably not gonna happen anytime soon.  If I can just swap in a Motorguide powerhead with built in transducer for a few hundred bucks that's the route I will probably take... wonder if they could make it into a 55 instead if a 45 at the same time? HMMMMMM LOL
898370,porkpie,2015-02-16 03:42:00,2521,"Pete,  I might be selling a 55lb thrust motorguide with universal sonar and wireless pedal and key fob in the spring, depending on if the wife will let me get a PD V2 ipilot.  You want me to let you know if I do?"
898408,Fisherpete,2015-02-16 15:20:00,1814,"Sure! PM me details please. 55lb is still a 12V system, correct?"
898446,porkpie,2015-02-16 17:59:00,2521,"You got it, it will be awaiting approval from the iron bank of bravos though (wife).  I'll PM you before the ice melts if i can convince her!  Still 12 volt.  I just bought the boat it's sitting on, so I'm not really sure how well this is going to go lol."
898475,AdamS,2015-02-16 19:49:00,161,"Hey Pete, I'm not sure about the gen1 units but I have a gen2 and was told that you can link an hds unit to an elite unit via the nmea 2000 network. It will allow you to share waypoints but that's it. I'm hoping thats true because I haven't installed the elite unit that I have yet but thats what my plan is.  In terms of the other things: I believe you are correct. the gen2's allow you to share a map chip, I don't know if the gen1's do. check here too for info http://www.bbcboards.net/lowrance-garmin-sonar-gps/ "
898489,Fisherpete,2015-02-16 21:01:00,1814,Thanks Adam!  porkpie - hope you were nice to her for Valentines day LOL.
