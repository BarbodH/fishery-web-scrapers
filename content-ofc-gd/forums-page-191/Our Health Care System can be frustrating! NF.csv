My wife had her surgery there in November  plus alot of the testing and even if I tried I wouldn't be able to say a single negative thing about them.  Absolutely top notch organization, especially the  nursing staff who treated my wife like she was the absolute most important person in the world.  As far as I'm concerned a nurse can't be overpaid....and that goes for surgeons too."

898349,bigugli,2015-02-16 01:19:00,6138,"There are good facilities and staff. There are also some less than stellar facilities and staff. An institution is only as good as thee people running it. Last I saw, we had not yet perfected humanity. That aside, I spent 10 years  in health care admin, and am ever so glad I was downsized out. The patient was, all too often, treated as an object rather than a person. And yes, some hospitals have horrible standards of care. It is also true that there are far too many bureaucrats and not enough care givers. A fact of life in any government funded or managed industry. On the plus side, I have seen some outstanding levels of care. Juravinski cancer facility in Hamilton has been fantastic in every aspect of my wife's treatment and care. My two spinal surgeries have been done with absolute professionalism and great care for the patient.  I know of few facilities down here that meet that level of care."

I know our system isn't perfect and there are times I do get frustrated with it but no matter how poor you are you can and do get really good quality of care in Canada. I can tell you right now that if it wasn't for our current system Sue probably wouldn't be with me today and if we had to pay for the medications she has to take everyday we would have trouble putting food on the table never mind a roof over our head.  We just tried to get health insurance so that we could head South for a few weeks, the underwriters didn't even want to give us a quote for Sue and when I pushed them for a price I was told it would be at least $1000.00/day because of her current issues and even then there would be restrictions and limits to the coverage!  Guess there are good and bad things on either side of the coin."

Art  We're not forced to stick to one doctor and we're allowed to switch family doctors any time or get a second opinion from a specialist in a hospital. I had two family doctors before finally being happy at a place where there's a family of doctors that see me so I never have the same person and if you disagree you can get another doctors opinion. Multiple family members have switched hospitals due to doctors not trying hard enough to figure out what's wrong or misdiagnosing people.  One such incident resulted in a cousin having a stroke. Our local hospital would do nothing and the parents had enough and went to another city where that hospital found the issue right away. They say the stroke that paralyzed half her body would have been 100% prevented if our hospital had done their job.   I honestly don't understand how so many of you folks have so much trouble getting treatment for so many things.

I dunno, maybe my family has been extremely fortunate, or some of you boys are just having plain lousy luck.  It totally depends on your doctor and hospital where testing and treatment occurs. Just like anything else there are places that do good work and others that should be out of business. Quite unfortunate, but that's the way she goes. For instance, the hospital here in Brantford is a joke while 35 minutes away in Hamilton you can get top notch service."
897906,Big Cliff,2015-02-13 18:53:00,6899,"Since last summer Sue has been having some heart issues, mind you this is nothing new, she had a quad bypass 20 years ago and has had stints put in since then but this was another issue. Her cardioligist wanted her to see a specialist in Ajax so even with a referal it took us a month to get in.  Fast forward: After several tests and a proceedure to try to correct the current issue they decided that in order to proceed further she needed another ""specialized test"" which could only be done in Toronto General.  So we go on the waiting list for this ""special""  MRI. weeks go by and we finally get the call, they have an opening so we head off to the big smoke. The test gets done Jan. 24 and a follow up appointment with the specialist gets booked for today Feb. 13 (ya, I know, it's a Friday the 13 th).  So, this morning Sue decides to phone the Dr's office just to make sure that they do have the test results before we drive all the way down to Ajax (this has happened to us twice before already) and sure enough they don't have them yet. A quick call to the hospital to see if they can be faxed over....... The diagnostic imaging Dept. is closed today, no explanation as to why, it's just closed.  So here we sit and wait some more because in three weeks no one has forwarded the results of a test to Sue's Dr.. I have booked a day off work so there goes a days wages and now we have another appointment set for March 4 (so I loose another day of work) and poor Sue sits on pins and needles for another three weeks. Her last comment to me was ""if I don't make it raise heck with someone!""  Pretty sad, I can take my dog in for an MRI and have the results back in under an hour but my wife has to wait 7-8 weeks. I might understand if this was a problem with her knee or something but this is her heart (she may be my pussycat she has already used up 8 of her 9 lives!)  Oh, and to top it all off her kidney specialist just told her that he will no longer be able to see her here in Lindsay because of cutbacks to the system; she now has to go to Peterborough to see him. Thank you Premier Winnie the POOP!  Sorry to rant but I am really frustrated."

897915,lew,2015-02-13 19:41:00,12766,"Sorry to hear about the hospital issues Cliff and hopefully Sue gets fixed up soon.  Just to show the other side of the Health Care coin though.  My wife has also gone through some serious health issues in the last year and we've both said how fantastic the entire system has been for her. Between Peterboro hospital, Sunnybrook and Lakeridge in Oshawa, every test called for by her doctors has been done very fast and on schedule and the treatments and surgery have been amazing. Not a single test or appointment has been delayed or cancelled and every single aspect of the entire process has been more than we could have ever hoped for.  Hopefully things turn around soon for you guys and Sue gets whatever treatments are required."

Took the day off work, I had time coming went to the office at 2:00 for my 2:15 .. Check in, we have nothing for you booked; a wasted day  can I book another since I'm here, sure what have you got -- how is October 24 for you.   !?!?!&$)("
897928,manitoubass2,2015-02-13 20:23:00,11391,"Sometimes I wonder if there isnt some sick people working in the medical profession?  I mean they come in all other walks of life, something to think about.  As a young adult, around 20, I had very bad back pains on my right side. I toughed it out for a day or two but it got sooo much worse, also started on my left side.  I drove to emerge and was admitted pretty quickly. I was in ALOT of pain. No position was comfortable at all. I was literally in tears.  A quick blood sample and urine sample after a shot of demerol showed I had a kidney infection and it was spreading to the left as well.  First shot did nadda, gave me a second and a third, finally some relief.  6 hours later and some iv antibiotics they were ready to release me. Of course id need more anti biotics later.  Then they gave me one more shot of demerol, 2 trylenol 3's and enough of those to last a few days.  I was looped. They asked if I had a ride home and i said yes, i have my vehicle outside.  Out i went, only two blocks from the hospital but stoned outta my tree. I wasnt fit to make that decision. I didnt even really recall the ride home until my girlfriend told me about it, like after 28 hours of sleep.  To be honest, I wouldnt even believe my story until it was later verified by my girlfriend and dr on a foĺlow up.  Crazy. Im glad im alive and i didnt harm anyone else.  Those drugs are crazy. I felt like i was in total control but there is no way i was."

Being as my wife is over 65...(don't tell her I told you that)...the $2100 was COMPLETELY covered by the government health plan.Yes, there are issues sometimes with our system just like anywhere else in the world, but I still think we have an excellent system.

As frustrated as I do get with it, we are still far better off than if we lived in so many other countries in the world.  And I agree with you Lew; if we had to pay for the medications that Sue and I have to take every day out of pocket there is no way we would be able to afford it so I guess in the long run we wouldn't be here to complain anyway LOL.

Some concerns yada yada send it out for testing. Wait to hear back from them...nothing. Finally I call to see what the delay is. They had no results. Why not....wait for it...THEY LOST MY TESTICAL.
