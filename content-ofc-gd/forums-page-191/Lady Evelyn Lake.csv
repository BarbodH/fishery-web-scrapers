899117,Can_38,2015-02-19 20:53:00,152,I have fished the Montreal river many times but have never venture up to Evelyn.  Until this year   Our lodge is 5min from the fine gentlemen who I hear shuttles your boat up to the top for a minimal fee.  Has anyone had much success fishing the strip of water leading into the main lake?  I will be there first week of June targeting wally's and giant pike.
