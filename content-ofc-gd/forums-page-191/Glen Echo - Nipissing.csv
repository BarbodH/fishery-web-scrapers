How is it as a family resort? Is it quite? How is the fishing? Never been to that part of Nipissing, are there sheltered areas to fish if it's too rough? Is there enough fish to keep the kids happy ( can be any fish species) Any other thoughts on the area, or resort? Thanks."

898624,G.mech,2015-02-17 14:58:00,830,Glen Echo is in the channel between Callander Bay and the Main lake which is a great location.  If the lake it too rough you can almost always find somewhere in the bay that's out of the wind to fish.  I have never stayed there but have visited and it's quite nice with decent cottages.  Bayview Camp and Cottages is just a stone's throw away and it is also a very nice spot for a family vacation.

898760,Andy,2015-02-18 01:25:00,330,I have a friend who goes up several times a year with his son. He loves it. He does really well for pickerel drifting the weed edges and for pike in the weed beds. And rarely blown off the water.
