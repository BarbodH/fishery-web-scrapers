Not much guts, but would get you there and back and easy to lift if your stuck.  Recover your seat with black duct tape.  I did one like that on the citation, it wasn't pretty but did the job."

I've actually cut my new plywood, drilled the holes and what not and just finished doing the first coat of varnish today. Then I'm giving it all to my GF and she's having it recovered for me, it's my xmas present. Will be a more comfortable ride than a toolbox lol."

Moral of the story, dont be an idiot when lifting sleds cause they are bloody heavy and will eff you up. ugh, that sucks man! Moving a sled by hand is never done in a comfortable position.

897848,wormdunker,2015-02-13 12:40:00,1711,"I've been reading this post with great interest.  I even made notes about repairs from you guys - the experts!  Nothing beats experience.  I've never owned a sled, but given our recent snow conditions I'm looking to buy a sled primarily for ice fishing.  First if any of you guys know of a decent sled in the $2,000. - $3,000.00 range, please PM me.  I would prefer something with reverse, hand warmers (I'm old), long track, fan cooled, a rear rack for gear would be nice, but, I am able to readily fabricate a rack.  Must have ownership.  I am presently looking at a 1995 Polaris 600 XT triple.  2,000 km asking only $1,500.00.  The seller states - Brand new seat $360. New studded track $1300.00 New tank $140. New windshield $120.       That's $1920.00 in new parts!  Is there something wrong with this picture??  He also says it needs clutch adjusted because it won't load up till you rev at 4,000 RPMs.  I phoned the Polaris dealer - new primary & secondary clutch is $1,000.00, plus labor.  At this point I think I would have a pretty reliable machine.  Any comments are greatly appreciated as I have no experience with sleds.  Thanx"
897850,Rod Caster,2015-02-13 12:45:00,5784,"1500 is a good price.  Gotta watch a bit for the Polaris triples, but overall they are great sleds. I'd buy that"
897853,wormdunker,2015-02-13 12:52:00,1711,Chad could you expand a little on what to look for in the triples - finicky carbs perhaps?  There's a few triples on kijiji here in Niagara.  I did wonder why so many are being sold or cuz it's near the end of the season.  I appreciate your input.

I could write a book on the crazy situations I've been in after throwing my back out.  It really never occured to me that this could have happened just as easily out on the trails 4 hours from the cottage in the middle of the bush...Or even worse, while i was alone out on the lake with a stuck sled...could make for an interesting wait.  Sometimes it takes learning the hard way to realize that when lifting a snowmobile its no different than lifting a box or gas cans etc etc."

I did wonder why so many are being sold or cuz it's near the end of the season.  I appreciate your input. The center pistons tended to have oil-supply issues on some of them. It's one of those 'common problems' associated with triples, and from what I understand, moreso on Polaris'. I wouldn't be all too worried about it, just get the dealership to confirm that the oil is sending and you should be ok. Oh, and test the compression on all cylinders before you buy, if the center piston has/had recent issues, you'll find out with a compression test. Google how to do it before you purchase.  I had a one-up XLT (1996) and loved it!"
897869,Sinker,2015-02-13 14:50:00,8692,"I'd stay away from a triple for ice fishing. Keep it simple.  The middle cylinder gets too hot on the triples and burns up. Been there, done that.  S."
897870,Rod Caster,2015-02-13 14:55:00,5784,"Ya, I wouldn't want to use a triple in slush, or deep snow. Now if you are mostly traveling packed trails, or lakes, then it would be less risky"
897872,chris.brock,2015-02-13 15:05:00,4053,"Fine sled, but like Sinker, not necessary for ice fishing and heavy.  a quick kijiji search, I think something like this would be the way to go  http://www.kijiji.ca/v-snowmobile/belleville/1994-arctic-cat-jag-440-low-milage/1051014813?enableSearchNavigationFlag=true"

897985,wormdunker,2015-02-13 23:25:00,1711,"Thanx guys I really appreciate your input as I'm a newbie searching for a sled.  Chad & Sinker - thanx I have heard triples are a problem from others. So I deleted that one. Chris Brock - thanx for the info for the 440 Jag - I'll take a closer look.  Hey guys I found this 1 in Trout Creek  Pls give me your opinions. 1995 Bombardier Grand Touring 670 Rave asking $1,800.00 9000 km, 1 year old studded, long track E start, reverse, heated grips front & rear Seller assures me the track, chain oil, compression & gauges are all good Starts very good, has ownership Is there anything I'm missing?  Is this the right sled for me used mainly for ice fishing? Seat needs to be recovered  no biggie for me. Thanx for your input."
897994,Rod Caster,2015-02-14 00:34:00,5784,"Decent price, reliable machines, but heavy....mind you, most 2-up's over 500cc are quite heavy. Maybe look for a 440 to 500cc fan-cooled 2-up around the same year? With fan-cooled, you just have to be mindfull of driving in warm (spring) conditions.  If you are not fishing back lakes, or breaking trails, I suppose weight isn't a major concern. I always liked the 1995Polaris  indy trail 500 (488) deluxe, which is the two-up version."
897998,porkpie,2015-02-14 01:18:00,2521,"Get a fan for sure if its your only mode of transport.  I have a polaris 500cc 2 up LT liquid, but I also have an ATV so i have no need to run on glare ice.  I'd really be looking for a lighter sled for ice fishing.  The big sleds are great, but heavy as hell when they bury in a slush bed or otherwise get stuck.  Only reason I have the sled that I do is that I bought it off my father-in-law for a really good deal.  If you wait a little longer you can get some really sweet deals in march.  Won't help you for this year, but good savings can be had!"

898008,Sinker,2015-02-14 01:47:00,8692,"9000km is getting up there for a sled. The big fancy machines are for riding trails. For icefishing, you just need aa basic machine that is reliable to get from A to B. The lighter the better, and fan cooled if you can. That Jag is a great sled.  S."

894227,Freshtrax,2015-01-26 04:02:00,2215,Chris.   Spray some ether around the primary clutch while it's idling see if the revs come up.  then do the same on the mag side.    If the revs come up the seal is no good.   Also check the choke make sure it's seating properly.

If the plugs look too lean, I doubt you're losing spark (ie TORS/TSS or coil issues) If it was a spark issue, your plugs would be wet and black. Ice is a possibility, but lean can also be caused by leaking crankseals or a cracked carb flange or even just a gummed up carb. I'd be looking at fuel system first."

Mine with stock gears will Burry the needle on 120 mph in 2000 ft.  Had it in radar a few times.  Was always 112 mph.    Now it's set up for shorter pulls  but it sure gets to 90mph a hell of allot quicker.    Sure surprises the hell out of allot of newer sleds.

It's a 1999 Ski Doo, Mxz600  Plenty fast enough for me and handles quite well.  Mechanically it has been a great sled.  Sure miss the old 1986 Indy Trail 488 fanner for fishing though.

Maintenance... mine seems to be pretty much bulletproof. Grease in the few zerks on the machine, a few sprays of lube here and there in / on the suspension metal and carry a spare belt. I've yet to even blow that! Starts every time.. even at -42 (but make sure you hand pull it first carefully at those temps)"
883949,DanD,2014-11-29 15:51:00,2223,No I found the sled up in Clinton; that's about an hour North of me.  Thanks for the advice; this is the first sled I've owned in 30 plus years. My last one was an early 70's Chaparral 440 SS; back then it was ride for an hour and then fix for two. LOL Went tail riding the second last time I rode it; forgot I had a hot set of plugs in it on the last ride I took. Melted a hole through the one piston and that was the end for me and sleds; until now. LOL  Dan.

884458,Freshtrax,2014-12-03 05:31:00,2215,"Did he just look at the carbs, or did he disassemble them and look at them on the inside?  #1 way to burn down a 2 stroke is a lean condition.    Like I said I do mine every November it takes me an hour or so but mine is jetted  on the ragged edge.   Not trying to harp.   Just trying to save your motor.

883463,Rod Caster,2014-11-27 02:23:00,5784,"Burn through or discard your old gas. Get some ethanol free and mixed gas (50-1 unless your machine needs a unique mix) and filler up. Not sure if your machine has an oil injector but for old machines I just pre-mix the gas and forget the oil injector. If the injector fails, you won't lose your engine. Like someone else said. A carb clean or rebuild (around $150 I'm guessing , including labor if you don't want to do yourself) will probably make it run nicer.  If you are worries about it sitting', covering it properly and lifting the track during the summer will avoid a lot of general aging."

883183,Bernie,2014-11-26 01:55:00,3190,Adding fuel to a cold engine points to lean fuel mostly. Could be a bad crankshaft seal. A bad seall allows air into the crankcase to lean the mixture.Once engine runs the seal warms and doesn't allow as much air to leak in.  But poor compression and weak ignition can also fool you.
883185,Bernie,2014-11-26 01:57:00,3190,After sitting for a month? Ok lolDry lines and primer system.

883192,Old Man,2014-11-26 02:03:00,822,"If it's  a crank seal, it's usually on the clutch side that is shot. A little ether sprayed around the seal area while the engine is idling will let you know if it's sucking air in. The idle will pick up considerably.  If the seals good, check compression. Remove both plugs and connect the tester to one cylinder. Hold the throttle wide open and pull over at least 5 times. Compression should be at least 110 PSI or better. Repeat on the other cylinder.  A good carb cleaning/rebuild can also improve or cure starting issues."
