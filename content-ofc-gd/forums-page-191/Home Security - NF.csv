When I designed the cabin I put a storage area underneath. This will raise my deck about 6' off the ground.The only access into the cabin will be via 2 stair cases to the deck. The deck will wrap around one side and the front.  My solution is an electric fence charger running around the deck railings with wire gate fences for the top of the stairs and metal stairs for the top 3 stairs as well as hot grounding alternating fence wires as the ground is solid granite.  The main purpose is to keep out bears and wolverines but it should keep people out as well.

They can also walk up the stairs but won't be able to get on the deck without  getting past the electrified gate wires.

I'm not sure what the best way to go is and am debating between a camera system and an alarm system (dogs and booby traps are off the table).  I would want to secure both the house and the shop which is a separate building but I do have a conduit buried between the building for cabling if necessary.  My concern with the alarm system is all the exposed wiring and cost of monitoring/false alarm fees etc but I'm not sure how effective CCTV cameras really are.  Any thoughts would be appreciated.

898101,Big Cliff,2015-02-14 17:21:00,6899,"I did a lot of research a couple of years ago on different systems because we had a few things go missing. I got some really good information from members of this site on the different systems and then on top of that I contacted a professional company to come and give me a quote. The long and short of it was:  A professional system with monotoring was going to cost me way more than it was worth to me.  Wireless systems are easier to install than wired systems but not as reliable.  Wired systems can be expensive (and difficult if you are not experienced) to install.  For what I had to protect a wireless system with a recorder was the best value for $s and the best place I found to buy it was Costco. The quality was excellent and the support was excellent. Price is going to vary all over the place depending on what you want to do with it and how many areas you want to cover.  Lastly, don't bother trying to ""catch"" someone ripping you off, try to prevent it from happening in the first place so lots of signage ""Monotored by Video"" signs will do a lot to prevent someone from taking the chance even if (no, espicially if) they can't see the cameras."

Make yourself more difficult then those around you. As FnA suggested a beware of dog sign, a few stickers on the windows letting otherS know your alarmed....

If it is answered they will say they are looking for someone fictional and pretend they got the wrong house.  If the door is not answered they will kick the door in and clean you out.  If they are unable to pull a vehicle up close to the house it makes it much more difficult.  Cheers  Craig
898257,ch312,2015-02-15 17:47:00,1590,"I'm not sure if I would waste money on an alarm system after seeing a few different people using different companies intentionally set off their alarms during the night just to see how long it would take for police to arrive. Long story short, you're on your own and alarm systems serve two purposes, deter rookie intruders and provide a false sense of security to the homeowner. I will say all 4 people had entry level systems and have no clue if response time decreases if a premium is paid?  I really believe the key to preventing people from entering my home is to not give them a reason in the first place. So many people have no clue that they're unintentionally advertising their home is full of goodies by not closing window coverings at night, leaving garage doors open all day, leaving their toys in plain sight for extended periods of time, tossing the packaging from high value items beside the curb or posting pics of everything purchased on their social media pages(big one!).  A few security system stickers on the windows and some dummy camera's will likely suffice. If the crooks ignore these two deterrents odds are they're experienced and the only thing that will stop them is force or an unusually quick police response time. That said, a PAL and cheap 12 or 20 gauge with a 12"" barrel will run you less than $500 and will provide a last resort solution should a simple robbery turn into a life threatening situation."
