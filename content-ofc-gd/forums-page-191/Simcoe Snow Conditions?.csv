But we may have to walk out there.  I would appreciate it if someone can give me an idea of the conditions.  Would we be walking on top of some hard packed snow?  Or, through three feet of deep snow?"
899089,vance,2015-02-19 18:54:00,719,we were out last Friday with Tim Hales out of beaverton and the snow was deep enough to make walking around difficult.There are some packed down trails that you might be able to use.  vance
