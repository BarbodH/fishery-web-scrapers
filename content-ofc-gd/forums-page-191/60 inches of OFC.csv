897836,John Bacon,2015-02-13 05:53:00,3277,No that's cool.   Just imaging how big those musky pictures will look now  They can be life size... until he catches the next world record at least.
897840,fishindevil,2015-02-13 08:07:00,6254,Lost another one said it Lew !!! You have to disable the voice regongnition on your smart TV !! It is listening to you and records you !!!! This is no lie !!!!! It's been on the news a few times this week you don't want all that top secret Muskie conversations getting to samsung do you !!!! Lol
897846,Handlebarz,2015-02-13 12:20:00,3790,"Lew that was the second thing I did when we up graded our 42""-70 first was watch some of my videos on it then I started to surf the net. You should be able to do it wireless Lew if your computer can connect through wifi.  It's crazy to think how far TV has come I actually don't have to hook up through the computer it has Internet browser built in and when I get around to it I will get a wireless keyboard and run direct from it.  Netflix is awesome"
897847,lew,2015-02-13 12:25:00,12766,I planned on doing it wireless Mike but couldn't get it to work. I called Samsung and was told the only way to use my computer normally and see it on the TV screen was to run a cable from HDMI2 on the TV to the back of my computer.  Works good for me anyways.
897858,FloatnFly,2015-02-13 13:09:00,1640,"Basically, you're using your TV as a huge monitor right now which is great, to see the other toys it has,just hook an ethernet cable from your modem to the back of the TV. and there should be a button on your remote to open it all up"
897859,lew,2015-02-13 13:21:00,12766,"The TV is connected to the internet and I have access to the other features, I just haven't spent too much time getting familiar with them."
897864,SirCranksalot,2015-02-13 14:08:00,3291,"I told my wife if she would bring me my coffee all day I'll never have to get out of my chair now.....she didn't  laugh  Remember back in the old days when we had to walk all the way across the living room and back again just to change the channel?? Aaah, life was tough back then, eh??"
897881,lew,2015-02-13 15:49:00,12766,And often have to adjust the horizontal & vertical holds just so we could watch the 3 channels we had available LOL
897916,Big Cliff,2015-02-13 19:41:00,6899,"Must be something I am missing here; our TV isn't ""wired"" to our router or anything (other than our satalite TV input and out sound system) but I can access anything on my computer directly through the TV (as long as I have it shared). I also can access a whole range of things, Youtube, Netflix, news, weather, movies....... even custome stuff Popcorn TV (which has lots of free movies on it)."

I have a Panasonic Vierra Smart TV, I have to hardwire it to the modem to access those features.  However, when I had bell fibe, I could access those features without a hardwire connection, since the TV receivers talk to the modem"
898039,wormdunker,2015-02-14 08:08:00,1711,"Yup - we had to get off the chair to change channels also.  Then 1 day my father installed a wired channel changer called ""Butler"".  You guys remember those boxes.  Awesome!"

898072,lew,2015-02-14 15:03:00,12766,I remember the 1st TV remote we got and it was called Space Command.  I thought I'd joined the Jetsons
898114,manitoubass2,2015-02-14 18:37:00,11391,"Anyone else grow up with the most luxurious tv of all time???  The monster 90"" tv record player combo? (The screen was actually like 24"" or 27"")"
898138,Whopper,2015-02-14 22:10:00,2174,"Yep, and I can remember helping my dad install a state of the art VHF/UHF antena on the roof that was about twelve feet tall, what a nightmare, all that yelling and screaming to communicate while ""TUNNING"" it in I also remember the neighbor getting the very first color TV in the neighborhood, all the kids lined up for their turn at peek, crazy times for sure"

897721,lew,2015-02-12 20:13:00,12766,"I bought a 60"" Samsung TV for the den a few weeks back and it's the same room where the computer is. I ran an HDMI cable from the TV to the computer and am now able to use the big screen for viewing the computer.  When I'm done viewing the internet I only have a button to push on the remote and I'm back to regular TV.  Picked up the cable and adapter this morning for $25 and it only took a few minutes to set it up which is pretty good considering I'm a total dolt when it comes to electronics.  I can now sit back comfortably in the Lazy Boy with the wireless mouse & key board on my lap and surf the 60 inch wide net .  Life just keeps on getting better  "
897722,manitoubass2,2015-02-12 20:16:00,11391,Hahah thats wicked Lew???
897724,aplumma,2015-02-12 20:29:00,6896,I knew I was a big man to you lew but I am not sure I can live up to a screen that size.   Art
897725,Acountdeleted,2015-02-12 20:30:00,2562,With the title I thought this was going to be a monster pike or Muskie. Still nice though.

897760,lew,2015-02-12 22:01:00,12766,"This is the 1st thing I've actually done with the Smart TV Cliff, infact I haven't even really played with it yet but will soon probably. Funny thing was I wasn't even looking for a TV as we had a nice one in the den already, but I was in a store with my daughter and they had this one at $400 off regular price so I grabbed it.  As I said previously, I don't really watch much TV other than a bit in the evenings, but I may find this thing to be alot of fun once I figure it all out."
897763,Big Cliff,2015-02-12 22:15:00,6899,"Lew, I am not very smart with all this new technology but we use ours now to play music from our computer through the TV (even figured out how to create our own play lists) and our sound system, NetFlicks, looking at any of our photos..... the list is endless it seems. What ever I could do on the computer before I can now do on the TV and a lot more, it is so easy!  Enjoy my friend because I know you will LOL."
897766,lew,2015-02-12 22:29:00,12766,"Thanks Cliff, I've talked to a few folks lately about the Smart TV's and they all say the same thing as you.  Perhaps it's time for me to catch up to the 21'st century LOL"
