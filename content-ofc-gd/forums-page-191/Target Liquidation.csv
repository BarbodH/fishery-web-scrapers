Oh, and when I was just out of the army and got offered a job in Sudbury but didn't have a place to stay or money to eat until I got my first pay cheque. It was the Salvation Army that gave me a room and fed me everyday for free until I could get my first cheque. After that, they charged me a whole $10.00 a week for a room and meals until I could save up enough to get my own place.  When my house burnt to the ground and my wife, son, and I escaped with nothing but our lives it was the Salvation Army that gave us food, clothing and enough basics to get us going again.

In one door with an empty cart and out the other with the same, spent maybe 10-15 minutes MAX strolling through without running into ANY ""traffic"" jams. Big banner sign hanging up saying 30% off with ""some"" exclusions- here's what I saw Food, electronics & paper was 10% off Clothes, housewares & dvd's 20% off Cosmetics 30% off (saw that from the food section - no wisecracks thanks!). In short, most (vast majority) items were a mere 10-20% off and to me that wasn't that big of a deal, if anything that just brought prices down to where I expect them to be. I just didn't see anything that made me want to buy.  Parking lot was full for the first time I'd ever seen, store was about as busy as a Walmart on Tuesdays.  Most people were, like me, pushing empty or near empty carts.  Almost every cash register was open with maybe 1 or 2 customers in line at most. All the staff were very friendly from what I observed, even the tiny little (teen?) lady wearing a safety vest saying she was ""Security) at the exit door.  Hope she didn't get blown away in the draft caused by all those leaving empty handed like myself. I'd have to say that was the busiest I'd ever seen that store, and yet there really wasn't that much merchandise actually being moved compared to the number of people shopping.  I wonder how long it'll be before they increase the discounts, hope it doesn't take them 2 years to figure that one out as well!  Michael"

Mike, as far as kicking them when they are down I would never give any large corp. sympathy, they sure don't care much for their own employees so why should I care about some faceless corporation?

Also they took over leases from a bunch bankrupt Zellers store that were going unpaid so you can't hold that against them. With the 17000 jobs do you realize that 10000 of them were people that have been working there for less than 6 months and all of them less than 3 years.

If you run a business and one of your customers doesn't pay you for what ever reason not only are you out of pocket for that money but you still have to cover your cost of doing business.  Your suppliers still have to be paid, you still have to cover your employees wages and benifits, you still have your overhead.......Oh, and you'll still have to remit your taxes or pay a penality.  On a sale of $100,000.00 your gross margine might be $30,000.00 (if you are lucky) which means you are now out of pocket $70,000.00 plus whatever your cost of operation is (the difference between your gross and net).  On top of all of that your cash flow is now affected, you suddenly don't have that $100,000.00 in your cash flow stream but your suppliers and employees don't care, YOU owe them money not Target and they still want to be paid.  Trust me, those suppliers are hurting really badly too, in fact they don't get to walk away from their debts like Target is (well some may be forced to declare bankruptsy too).  To top it all off I hear that a lot of the Target employees are doing some pretty nasty things, sabotageing products, not showing up for work, showing up but not working. I understand their frustration but IMHO the best way to handle this is to do your job to the best of your ability, do it with pride and your head held high.

Lost his job in 2008. He was the HR person for his facility. They moved the whole business back to the states....just like target is doing now. Lots of the employees developed an BADattitude at the end...some of the stories he has told me...unbelievable. He showed up and did his job everyday....right to the very end. 14 months later he gets a phone call at home. It's the old plant manager from his last job. Wants to know how my brother is making out. Long story short he wanted him to come and start an HR department at his new employers. Over 5 years there now and he loves it. Even got his wife in there as well and drive in together in the morning. He is pretty confident he got that job because of how he carried himself during the closing of the other place.
