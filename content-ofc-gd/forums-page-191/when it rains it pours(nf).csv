898707,Big Cliff,2015-02-17 22:43:00,6899,"My heart goes out to you! I too have been there many time, perhaps too many. My only advice is that you don't worry about forgetting, that won't help but time will.  Always keep a place in your heart for those special memories!"
898711,Moosebunk,2015-02-17 23:12:00,3970,Sorry to hear bud.  Sympathies.
898716,motv8tr,2015-02-17 23:21:00,2587,"Very sorry for the loss of your friend, companion and family member, I too have loved and lost them over the years, and it is never easy.  You will have their memories for a lifetime, cherish those and bring them out when your are down and they will bring a smile and warm your heart when you need it most  Maureen"
898719,leaf4,2015-02-17 23:25:00,2466,"Condolences, never easy, especially when you see how sad the kids get its almost worse"
898740,NAW,2015-02-18 00:12:00,4022,"Sorry to here about your dog.  Specially having the two pass to close together.  I have only owned one dog, who ended going with the other half in our separation this summer.  I thought that was hard, I couldn't imagine having her gone for good."
898749,bigugli,2015-02-18 00:33:00,6138,"I know it hurts. Life just got more miserable as we lost first Peanut, then Lucky.  I did not feel too terrible when Lucky's time had come. We were sad, yes, . However, we had many years of friendship and, yes, love. I was actually glad she wasn't going to suffer. You and the children enjoyed Tala's company for 12 good years. They aren't just dogs. They are our children, and for children they are often something more. Remember and cherish that as you move forward and find a new friend"
898754,BowSlayer101,2015-02-18 01:01:00,296,"So sorry for your loss man, my husky just recently passed away, very hard to deal with for sure, both mentally and physically."
898758,Steve,2015-02-18 01:19:00,2075,"The loss of a pet.  One of the hardest things we go through as humans. We lost our dog, Ziggy, in 2007.  I still have not been able to get another dog.....  I have a cat we rescued almost a year ago.....Lannister is now our family pet.  One day I will get a dog again....one day."
898761,Handlebarz,2015-02-18 01:26:00,3790,Sorry to hear this news we have the first dog I have ever owned and can't imagine how it will be to not have one in our life.
898769,Sinker,2015-02-18 01:57:00,8692,"I know the feeling bud. My lab passed away on canada day. Ive always had a dog, and ive found it easiest to get a new one asap. I have a new black lab now, and find myself calling him the wrong name once in a while. They are all so different, you never forget the quirks of any dog you've had. The memories live on forever.  Keep your chin up. Things will get better.  S."
898582,manitoubass2,2015-02-17 04:28:00,11391,"Husky number two just passed away?  Just went to grab her for a feed and she was gone, laying in her house.  Telling the kids is never easy.  Tobacco was laid and tommorrow we'll take her to be layed to rest with her sister.  Such a bummer  Rip Tala"
898583,Tomcat,2015-02-17 04:34:00,395,Sorry for your loss! It's always hard to lose a dog.
898584,Freshtrax,2015-02-17 04:48:00,2215,"Ah man ,  always a tough day."

898589,tb4me,2015-02-17 05:33:00,3295,Sorry for your loss..Man I hate that part of loving dogs....
898590,manitoubass2,2015-02-17 05:41:00,11391,"Thanks alot for the condolences, it helps.  as outdoorsman, IMO loosing a pet can be just brutal.  all those outings, memories etc, ughhh.   I cant explain it.  our partners in life, amazing trips, great family times. Our dogs play such a big role in all of that.  today I lost a friend, my outdoors partner, my protection...  she was the best. Great with the kids, everyone really. She loved fishing, always by our sides. She even had a place at the table, she lived a great life.  the kids lost a great friend, she was like that blanket of comfort. As my kids ventured I always felt they were safe cause Tala protected them.  this dog took wolf and coyotes like a secret service agent for my kids and me.  12 great years..."
898591,Freshtrax,2015-02-17 05:46:00,2215,"Sometimes I wished they lived for 40 years,   But then you wouldn't have as many of them.  I know it sounds crazy now but you will get a new one and love it just as much."
898592,manitoubass2,2015-02-17 05:52:00,11391,"I know what your saying man, thanks"
898594,chris.brock,2015-02-17 06:04:00,4053,"Sucks to hear this Rick, I'm a pet guy too, I can relate. She sounds like she was a great friend."
898595,FrankTheRabbit,2015-02-17 06:23:00,479,"Aw man, never easy to lose a pet, that's meant so much to you and the family. I'm sure she was the happiest and luckiest dog to be part of a loving family.  We've had our family dog since October of 2000 and everyday, I keep wondering when that particular day will come. Dog's are most certainly a man's (or woman's) best friend."
898596,davey buoy,2015-02-17 08:16:00,5505,"Never gets easy Rick as you well know.Been through that too many times.My last is still in my mind every day.Just remember the good days,that's all that's left!!.It sure sucks though."
898597,lew,2015-02-17 08:18:00,12766,It's always lousy when we lose a pet  but I know you gave your friend a wonderful life and that's the way dogs should be treated.  Been through it a few time myself bud and know exactly how your feeling right now.  Condolences from one dog lover to another.
898598,Reel Man,2015-02-17 09:59:00,80,"So sorry for your loss Manitoubass2.  I know my pups are definitely family members, not pets.  So hard to share all that love and so many great memories only to have to say goodbye too soon!  I hope that losing your two friends will not harden your heart to the thought of finding another companion.  Lots of homeless animals out there in need of a forever home.  Just think that Tala had her years of love and comfort and has now given up her spot knowing that another soul out there needs your love and companionship even more."
898599,spincast,2015-02-17 10:28:00,3279,"they make a special bond, really leaves a whole in the life when they pass.  sorry for your loss MB2"

898617,aplumma,2015-02-17 13:49:00,6896,Sorry Rick for the loss. I have had the pleasure of many four legged companions and as each one passed on the memories they leave reassure me that it was the path that we both were meant to travel. Future adventures and companionship await you when your head and your heart are ready till then celebrate the memories you have.   Art
