897797,Sharkbait22,2015-02-13 02:07:00,297,"An Ion will cut through 36"" but you won't get 40 holes. Also you want to keep the batteries warm when south of 28C. If the battery is really cold the auger may start and stop for a few minutes until the battery warms up by discharging. The ion does come with a extension for thick ice and huts raised off the ice."

This year I am using this, with the 4.0 Ah battery        It,s got the balls to allow me to use my 8"" this year.  I have managed to drill up to 30+ holes through 16"" of ice so far with one battery and still have 2 bars left.  Keeping the batterys warm is a huge help."

Im sure the Clam adapter would be just like using the Ion IMO.  The advantage of using the cordless,you can use it all summer long as well."

Is it that thing?  http://www.canadiantire.ca/en/pdp/electric-ice-drill-adapter-0788167p.html  Have you ever tried a 8"" Jiffy auger with ripper blades instead of the finbor?"

897983,misfish,2015-02-13 23:20:00,29133, No I have not. Im thinking this would be hard on the drill.

898425,ch312,2015-02-16 16:36:00,1590,With the Clam mount it's exactly like using a gas auger with the thumb throttle and it's very easy to use and hold. Definitely worth the $80.

After replacing the drill he plans on getting the Clam Ice Auger Conversion Kit. It is designed to take the stress through an industrial bearing and save the drill.  The adapter makes no difference to the drill. It just makes it easier to hold thats all. I still free hold my drill with the 8"". Just tuck it in to my side and let it drill the hole.  You can,t force these like you can a gas jobber. Let the blades cut on their own."
898436,farsider,2015-02-16 17:07:00,456,"Clam says it reduces the torque on the drill itself through the use of bearings in the adapter plate.  FYI - Sail has it on sale for 15% off $80 right now.  http://clamoutdoors.com/store/clam/augers/conversion-kit/ice-auger-conversion-kit-drill-plate.html  Cheers,  mark"

No need for smelly gas oil and pulling and pulling when it wont start. I like the fact,if my batteries die,I still have the handle to crank some holes if need be. The the ION have that option?   And welcome to the board."
