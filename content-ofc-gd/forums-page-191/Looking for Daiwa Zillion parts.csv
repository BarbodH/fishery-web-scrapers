Mechanically, it's solid, but cosmetically, I'd give it a 7/10. There aren't too much scuffs and scratches, but noticieable enough to me in wanting to change that.  I've gone through eBay, Kijiji, TackleTour and couldn't come up with a vendor that sells the required parts.  If any of you could point me in the right direction, that'd be great!  Thanks."

898538,FrankTheRabbit,2015-02-17 00:20:00,479,"Fisherpete: Thanks for that info. I'll give'em a ring tomorrow and see what they have.  Steve: Thanks for the inputâ€¦perhaps it's that time of year when bass gear is kinda slow. I'll definitely keep an eye out for anything over there. Shipping over from the US shouldn't be too bad, since they're small items.  I've also sent Ah_long a message, since he services quite a lot of reels, to see if he has anything for sale.  Much appreciated fellas!"

898580,mattaw,2015-02-17 04:17:00,162,Aikman is the authorized Daiwa dealer in Ontario (http://www.daiwa.com/Service/Warranty-Service-And-Parts.aspx). They should be able to order you parts and help you out. If not posting a WTB thread here or on TackleTour may dig up what you need!
