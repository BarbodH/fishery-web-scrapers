898117,Joey,2015-02-14 19:35:00,9122,"Oh Emil, that sucks, the walking part I mean, nice that you actually caught fish.   pm me as Paul likes to go out more than I do and we have a snowmobile so you two could go out together"
898119,Burtess,2015-02-14 19:38:00,901,A good pair of snowshoes + Smitty sled does wonders......  Burt
898120,Acountdeleted,2015-02-14 19:46:00,2562,"For limiting out in 15 minutes I feel like the trek is worth it. That being said, I felt your pain reading that haul. Congrats on the beauty whitefish."
898126,misfish,2015-02-14 20:47:00,29133,"The price you pay for taking the unbeaten path Emil. Looks like a nasty day Sunday. Monday I might get out.  Nice fish.  BTW, your no spring chicken anymore. I feal your pain.LOL"

898140,Cosmos,2015-02-14 22:13:00,588,Nicely done.
898147,Beavertail,2015-02-14 23:14:00,331,"Nice report and nice fish! I know that feeling all too well (the walking part and sheer exhaustion) You have to admit though, at the end of the day when you finally make it back to your vehicle it's a pretty damn good feeling! I'm sure you wouldn't miss it too much once you get a sled though."
898183,Meegs,2015-02-15 01:44:00,249,I would a been out there with you today for sure but was another busy day at the fishing show.   Maybe next weekend if I can get the sled running
