I have been using a HD Camcorder for fishing trips and the quality is pretty nice but kinda getting the GoPro itch for easier control/water protection etc. Being able to remote monitor the video on a tablet would be pretty nice also.  Anyways, seen a few guys on the web able to wire up a cable for WiFi communication with video monitoring.    Seen guys make submersible little subs with the GoPro attached also.  Wouldn't mind looking underwater at a few spot in Balsam as there is a rumour about some moron losing his favorite rod overboard in the lake last year. The same moron lost an anchor also... 8)  Might be a fun project building something with underwater lights also.  "

899027,John Bacon,2015-02-19 14:34:00,3277,Some of the Lake Ontario salmon fisherman have mounted GoPros to their down riggers.  They are rated for some pretty deep water.  They don't have any remote controls; they just turn it on before sending it down and see what they get later.

899059,MrSimon,2015-02-19 16:32:00,217,"I've done this!  First, I tested the wifi in a bathtub and even a few inches of water wrecks the signal.  So I took a piece of shielded COAX cable (about 15'), peeled about three inches of the outside cover and shielding back on both ends (exposing the shielded inner wire), taped one end to the GoPro, and taped the other end to my iPhone.  It worked!!!  It was a bit finicky about the placement of where you tapped the wire on both the camera and the phone, but after a bit of tweaking, it worked great."
899092,Raycaster,2015-02-19 19:10:00,528,"Mr.Simon, awesome about the success, gives me hope! Just have to build a useable small vessel with lights and I may find my old fishing rod. (Probably cost more to clean than buy a new one!)"
