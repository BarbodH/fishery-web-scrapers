It is for their lure building contest I have entered they have the top 4 blade baits to be voted on if you can look at them then pic your favourite.  My bait is the white tiger if you feel it looks the best I would love the votes. You can only vote once. If you like one of the others better vote for it but I would love your votes if you feel my bait should win.   http://muskie.outdoorsfirst.com/board/forums/thread-view.asp?tid=101303&posts=2&start=1  Thanks Mike
