This is a terrible thing. You move to Gods country and have to worry about your kids and pets getting hurt by a trap on your own property, that is just sad. The first thing I learned when moving to the country after living in the big city for 45 years, crime is everywhere, not as often perhaps but it's out here big time, probably more per capita.  Someone mentioned a law suit for the dogs pain and suffering. You can recover for vet bills but there is no recovery for pain and suffering for an animal."

My guess after he reported to the proper authorities they set up a sting operation with undercover swat teams hiding in the woods 24/7 and drone aircraft constantly flying overhead but still no results yet and that's why he's not reported back yet........LOL...  My more educated guess is he reported it and they took down the report and that's it so far until he has more info for them because they have more important issues to deal with.......like where to stop for coffee way up there.  Now back to our regular programming................."

897145,outllaw,2015-02-10 14:52:00,1232,great link gerrit... I see trapping as a heritage that's truly canadien. doing fur trapping in a responsible manner is the only way to keep it.

897172,manitoubass2,2015-02-10 17:10:00,11391,"I have no thrilling story to tell here.  A clean sweep of the property revealed very old traps and snares.  Very rusted and not in use. The trap my dog was caught in was so rusted at could barely close(thats why she was uninjured.  The property owner has no agreements to trap on this property, and its been passed down from his father. These seem to have been here a VERY long time.  They are now removed, at least I hope all of them are.  Thanks for all your concerns?  Im just happy its safe out there.  And yes I added some good signage lol."
897176,Fisherman,2015-02-10 17:21:00,7201,Good ending to the problem.  I'm almost wondering if they are the old traps from a trapper that passed away and nobody picked them up.
897180,manitoubass2,2015-02-10 17:30:00,11391,"Actually the landlord thinks he might have set them as a young boy, or even his dad. The property has been in there family for well over 100 years.  I found an old roll of fencing under some brush and it looks like some of it was nipped to make the snares.  This was either sustanance for a family or kids learning to trap???  The township and a few local trappers sure were a big help!"

897897,lew,2015-02-13 17:14:00,12766,Here's an article from a local paper in my area pertaining to traps.  Thought some may find it interesting.  http://lakefieldherald.com/2015/02_13_2015/traps.html
897911,Big Cliff,2015-02-13 19:15:00,6899,"My heart goes out to this family. I had a GSP for 14 years and hunted with him all over the place, It broke my heart when the time came that I had to let him go but if he had been killed in a trap like this I'm not sure what I'd have done.  at the same time I have to see the other side of the coin, if trapping was no longer allowed in these areas (and then the problem becomes which areas because there will always be someone that doesn't want it in ""their"" area).  So, what is the answer? I really wish I knew! We could insist that dogs not be allowed to run free, we already do that in many areas but if it is crown land then it belongs to all of us so why shouldn't my dog be allowed to run free on it.  We could stop trapping on crown land but that wouldn't be fair to the trapper not to mention what it might do to the animal populations that are controled by trapping and the problems that might create. Perhaps all traps should have a sign posted in bright red or something but dogs can't read so I guess that wouldn't help.  How do we please everyone?"
897937,Sinker,2015-02-13 20:35:00,8692,There is no pleasing everyone!!!
897946,Big Cliff,2015-02-13 21:28:00,6899,"Then the question becomes ""Who do we please""?"
898346,Sinker,2015-02-16 00:37:00,8692,"Yourself. Dont worry about what others think. Just be you, and do what you believe in. You're already doing that my friend."
896632,manitoubass2,2015-02-07 21:46:00,11391,"Well isnt that nice, my kids take the dog for a walk on the backside of our property?.  Im outside feeding my other husky while all the sudden my son comes running full tilt in tears.  So turns out my dog get her foot clamped in a trap. Not to sound insensitive but thankfully it wasnt one of my kids.  I follow his lead and get my poor dog out. Luckily shes not hurt to bad. Pretty pissed off but ok.  Sure enough the kids show me multiple traps and snares, all on our property.  Now im really upset about all this, but just to add to it, its on our friggen property so if anyone else found these it would appear to be me that had set them!  What in the heck is with some people?  Seriously, setting traps on a families property that has kids???  I mean illegal is illegal either way but wow!  Cant wait to see what the MNR has to say about this"
896634,irishfield,2015-02-07 21:50:00,26272,Been there with our 108lb lab.. and unfortunately for Leah she couldn't release the beaver trap and carried him over 3500 feet back to the house for me to release him.
896636,manitoubass2,2015-02-07 21:52:00,11391, Thats insane
896638,manitoubass2,2015-02-07 21:55:00,11391,"What would one be trying to trap like this?  I mean my dogs ok, so it has to be for small game. Or is the goal to trap and leave till they die?"
896640,irishfield,2015-02-07 22:02:00,26272,"Hopefully it's just someone that doesn't know the boundary and put them on your place by mistake. Many guys run trap lines for mink, marten, etc this time of year.  In our case it was Ducks Unlimited trapping beaver by putting the leg trap just into the water off shore in the controlled swamp. Now if they had of told use they'd done so.. on our property... then Leah wouldn't have taken him down to the dam for a swim."
896645,manitoubass2,2015-02-07 22:14:00,11391,"Yeah i hear ya, but there is no way to mistake our property. Its defined by a road on two sides, river on the other two sides.  And yeah were out aways but we are still in a township"
896646,Blue Lk,2015-02-07 22:17:00,337,That really sucks. I would be putting out a trail cam & catch them in the act.
896649,manitoubass2,2015-02-07 22:21:00,11391,Now there is an idea!  Hard to think about a solution when your so mad  Thanks man!
896661,outllaw,2015-02-07 22:56:00,1232,that sucks. I have had the same issue with the now charged musky thumper. he has snared cottontails here for years in city limits. got my labs 2x. after that I walked his snare lines with cutters.. to me legal trappings fine but theres always the poacher isn't there
896720,wormdunker,2015-02-08 08:08:00,1711,"Sorry to hear a story like that.  As you pointed out - it could have been much worse.  I hate to think of ""what if""."
896721,Big Cliff,2015-02-08 09:56:00,6899,"Well, first of all I am glad to hear that your dog is ok and that no one got hurt. Since there doesn't seem to be any damage to your dog's leg/paw it sounds like it might have been a Modified leg hold trap. Unlike the old style they are now available with offset jaws, or lamination, or both, which decrease pressure on the animals' legs.  Traps are also available with a padded jaw, which has rubber inserts inside the jaws to reduce animal injuries It sounds like the one your dog found was set for coyote or fox, was there any bait hanging above it?  Do not try to confront the person that set those traps or try to remove them yourself, you have no idea who or what you could be dealing with, simply call MNR or the police and let them deal with it! If nothing else any existing traps will be removed safely and the trapper informed that he/she is tresspassing."
896723,Mister G,2015-02-08 10:53:00,1429,"That really sucks. I would be putting out a trail cam & catch them in the act. I also was going to suggest a trail cam to see who they are but I would also collect all the traps and secure them. When the those who set them can't find them they will be milling all around that area and your trail cam will definitely have many pics of them or better yet a video with sound as MANY cameras now do.  A return of the traps is your option, but if it was me I would have them pay a fine to me for trespassing and for the pain your family dog went through. If they don't like those conditions, then call the police and turn the traps over to them so they can handle the matter."

If they don't like those conditions, then call the police and turn the traps over to them so they can handle the matter. Might also be a good way to loose a trail cam or get yourself hurt! What happens if who ever set those traps comes along while you are removing them? What happens if you miss one or two and your dog or one of the kids does get hurt? IMHO let the MNR and/or the police handle it, they will insure that the traps get removed safely and that the person who set them is dealt with accordingly. It's a much safer solution!"
896728,Mister G,2015-02-08 11:58:00,1429,"A proper set up of a trail cam several feet up a tree should not be noticed and should always be locked down as all mine are. Never lost one YET.  And when it comes to protecting MY land, MY family and MY dog I don't coward down and ""hope"" someone else will take care of it.  But everyone is different."
896729,Rod Caster,2015-02-08 12:28:00,5784,"Yep, I'd gather my own evidence, re-asses the situation, then decide how to fix the situation (mnr, police, large signage on property)"

And when it comes to protecting MY land, MY family and MY dog I don't coward down and ""hope"" someone else will take care of it.  But everyone is different. Well, I am anything but a coward but old age and experience has taught me that confrontation isn't always the best solution especially if this individual is already aware that he/she is trespassing and involved in what could be illegal activity.  As for the trail cam; well someone that is experienced enough to be trapping has probably spent plenty of time in the bush and it would take one VERY  well placed trail cam for them not to spot it. High up in a tree and well secured won't stop a .22 from destroying anything that might be on it.  But you are right, each to their own."
896737,FloatnFly,2015-02-08 13:43:00,1640,"An experienced trapper always carries a gun and a knife with them, especially for coyotes.  if you want to confront someone with weapons, go for it. traps will sometimes have identification markings on them that the mnr will be able to track the trapper down, its happened to a friend of mine.  call the mnr and local police, have them come out that day! put up large signs that say private property, no trespassing. not sure how much land you have, but it could be as simple as someone not realizing that they are trapping on your property."
896738,Meegs,2015-02-08 13:58:00,249,For sure let the police/ministry know.  Get a trail cam and a bunch of signs and start posting.  I'd be infuriated if that happened to my dog oN  my own property.   Couldn't imagine what I'd do if a kid accidentally set one off.
896739,Canuck2fan,2015-02-08 14:14:00,1444,"I tend agree with Big Cliff. If someone is illegally trapping, they aren't probably too worried about a good tongue lashing from a home owner. If you really think you are bullet and knife proof then by all means be sure and feed your ego by confronting them.... Of course you might just wind up doing your family more long term harm than good, it things get ugly. Criminals have a lot less to lose than an honest home owner.  Also didn't you just move there Manitou? Maybe the trapper had an agreement with the previous owner? I know when my grandfather trapped he went EVERY YEAR to all the landowners and made sure in writing it was still OK to keep trapping.... Maybe this trapper didn't know the property was sold and it is an honest mistake. BTW if the rivers on your property are navigable he might think he has a right to trap the river bed.  The other thing is, I wouldn't expect the police or the MNR for that matter to have the expertise to find each and every trap without the trappers co-operation... Just because they have a badge it won't necessarily make them an expert on removing a trap line. So at some point it would be best if the trapper does help them with the removal."
896753,Acountdeleted,2015-02-08 16:01:00,2562,"I'd throw the book at em. I'd be so angry that they didn't post signs or talk to nearby property owners.  There is a certian responsibility with hunting, fishing, trapping etc and they clearly avoided it.  It may be an 'honest mistake'. But you have a level of responsibility when you are doing anything that could cause harm to people or property.  I'm so glad no one or your dog were seriously hurt."
896758,richyb,2015-02-08 16:15:00,774,Where are you located ?  Its illegal to set snares south of the french river . Are there tracks of the guy coming to check the sets ? He should be checking leg holds every day.
896772,manitoubass2,2015-02-08 17:25:00,11391,This is now a possible legal matter so ill chime in when I can.  Miigwich
896842,fishing n autograph,2015-02-08 22:27:00,2540,I would also call the police because it's mischief endangering life and setting traps
896845,glen,2015-02-08 22:56:00,2641,You would call yourself?    Lol.  Get a trail cam anyway.
896848,cram,2015-02-08 23:16:00,1733,"If you're new to the area, ask your neighbors if they know who it is.  Could be a misunderstanding. Otherwise, just call the police.  Why deal with it yourself?  Not worth it, IMO."
