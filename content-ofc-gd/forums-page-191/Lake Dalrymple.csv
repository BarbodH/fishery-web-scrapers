A buddy and I are thinking of doing an all day and over night fishing trip next weekend there. I have fished the lake many times catching crappie, pike, walleye and bass but never in the winter. Any info on how the ice fishing is on the lake especially for crappie I would greatly appreciate it!  Thanks Jeff"

898113,Locnar,2015-02-14 18:26:00,645,Do you know where to access the ice?
898121,Acountdeleted,2015-02-14 19:49:00,2562,Pretty sure the only access is at the bridge dissecting the north and south parts of the lake. I spent about 45 minutes once looking for a different access with zero success.
