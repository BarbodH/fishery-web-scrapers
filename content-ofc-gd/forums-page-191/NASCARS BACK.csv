898271,misfish,2015-02-15 18:45:00,29133,And it didnt take long for heads to get hot.  HAPPY HAPPY HAPPY.  
898275,lookinforwalleye,2015-02-15 18:59:00,4399,What in the world is Nascar thinking with this type of qualifying....go on out there boys and tear up your cars....LOL they are bumping in the pits nobody wants to leave...craziest thing I have every seen!!!
898276,misfish,2015-02-15 19:02:00,29133,"Yup. I was wondering what the hell they were doing at the start. Clint me thinks is going to get a fine for bad mouthing.  I see his point though.  Guess nascar is trying to make if more interesting for the fans,not the drivers.  Dales coming up next."
898280,lookinforwalleye,2015-02-15 19:07:00,4399,I am sure he will be getting a fine....buddy who caused the accident said he was blocking...blocking in qualifying ridiculous!!!  :wallbash:  :wallbash:  This is just crazy
898282,misfish,2015-02-15 19:11:00,29133,8th  On to the next round.  That was funny to see them all sit there.
898283,misfish,2015-02-15 19:12:00,29133,M Waltrip 6th    He can still drive.LOL
898285,lookinforwalleye,2015-02-15 19:19:00,4399,8th  On to the next round.  That was funny to see them all sit there. What would happen if they all just sat there???
898288,misfish,2015-02-15 19:29:00,29133,The next round will be a  feast. I can see a wreck coming.
898292,misfish,2015-02-15 19:42:00,29133,I guess jr is not friends with his team mates. WTH is going on there?
898293,Muskieman,2015-02-15 19:46:00,2472,It's different that's for sure ...
898306,Old Ironmaker,2015-02-15 21:43:00,8243,"No wonder I can't find a football game on. I like Nascar, especially back in the old days when a bunch of overweight guys drove in circles in the family car. We all thought, hey I can do that."
898350,richyb,2015-02-16 01:32:00,774,"Damn !!! Jr got caught with his car 1/8"" too low in the front left and now will have to start at the back of the pack."
898359,manitoubass2,2015-02-16 02:43:00,11391,Oh no! 1/8th gate!!!???
898413,Mike Pike,2015-02-16 15:41:00,1332,"Ok, after that show, I needed to take a couple of aspirins for my head.  That's was the most confusing sporting event I've ever watched!!!  Sorry, but when the drivers can't figure out what's going on, how can the fans?  I just think the Nascar executives over-thought this one.  I love the way the TV crew kept trying to spin it as a positive but honestly, I thought all the confusion by the drivers and the race out of the pits only to stop was all rather embarassing."
898424,grizzlybri,2015-02-16 16:34:00,565,"And it didnt take long for heads to get hot.  HAPPY HAPPY HAPPY.     wait wasn't it only a week ago, you were complaining about the lack of Fishing related threads, and now you start a thread about people that turn left for a living. Now I have no problem with the thread because I'm active in the hockey one.  I see what you did, you wanted a bunch of fishing threads to come in before you made your NASCAR thread and hope that nobody would pick up on it lol, I'm on to you Brian"
898426,misfish,2015-02-16 16:36:00,29133,"Yes it was a bit of a cluster. Not sure if they were trying to make nascar look bad or what.  I can understand their dislike,but they are drivers. Just drive.LOL  As for JR, it wont matter. 1/8 you say? OH MY. They dont call him the pied piper for nothing.  I just dont get why all four drivers didnt work together, like the ford boys did.  I think Jimmie and Jeff will get eat,n up at the duels. If I was JR,I would leave them behind as well. JMO.   LMAO Brian  I dont think there was a complaint made,just a request for more fishing threads. LOL"
898430,grizzlybri,2015-02-16 16:47:00,565," LMAO Brian  I dont think there was a complaint made,just a request for more fishing threads. LOL  I stand corrected, I'll go back to the hockey thread now"
898447,Garnet,2015-02-16 18:01:00,2056,I seen those moves from 2nd to lead gives me faint hope. Looks like another stinker coming our way. Don't know how it will be worst than last year.
898449,manitoubass2,2015-02-16 18:15:00,11391,"I cant watch Nascar, Ive tried but I find it too boring?."
898459,Garnet,2015-02-16 18:34:00,2056,Only team sport I watch.
898570,tb4me,2015-02-17 03:05:00,3295,I also thought the qualifying process was horrible..Waltrip was going on and on about how exciting it is for the fans..Come on really? I thought it sucked..Plain and simple.. Bring on the 500 next Sunday!
898604,misfish,2015-02-17 12:16:00,29133,"LOL BUT HE HAS A SEAT ON THE SHOW,SO HAS TO BE NICE. LOL"
898628,outllaw,2015-02-17 15:17:00,1232,wallip aka jaws needs to go.. nascar seems to cripple itself more every year
