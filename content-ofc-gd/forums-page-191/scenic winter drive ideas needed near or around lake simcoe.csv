898211,huzzsaba,2015-02-15 12:54:00,884,A friend of mine wants to take a winter drive from mississauga to simcoe or further north. Just a day trip. Any ideas for a scenic drive? We dont plan to get out and do anything.  Just simply drive and explore the area.  thanks!

Wife and I do it all the time, sometimes driving 300 miles round trip through the boonies in a day just for lunch. Sometimes were gone so long we have to stop for supper too.  The best trips are the ones without a destination.  Pick some quiet roads, take a camera & enjoy."
