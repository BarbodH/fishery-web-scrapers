896963,porkpie,2015-02-09 17:14:00,2521,"I have been using a life proof for iphone for the last 2 years.  They replaced if twice under warranty.  The seals failed, only because the audio was so bad on the originals that I had to take the case off all the time unless I was out fishing.  This causes premature wear.  The second replacement they sent me had all the bigs worked out.  You can here well, and the case hasn't been off in over a year.  They finally got it right.  I would now buy again if I changed phones."
896964,manitoubass2,2015-02-09 17:22:00,11391,"Good luck  Im still searching for an s5 case and there isnt alot of options.  I do believe i just seen a lifeproof case for s4 at walmart last week, $79"
896967,bare foot wader,2015-02-09 17:28:00,1354,"another vote for lifeproof...I have an iphone 5 with the waterproof case and the floating lifejacket...definitely paid for itself a few times  I would get the nuud model without the screen protector, easier to use the touch screen I found"
896971,JerryW,2015-02-09 18:01:00,1,I too am looking for a place that has cases for my Samsung S5 - hopefully something with a fish theme. Any ideas?
896972,Jon,2015-02-09 18:09:00,209,"I have been using a Lifeproof Fre for my Iphone 5 since I got the phone about 2.5 years ago. The first case failed at the audio mute button about 3 months ago but Lifeproof sent a replacement case at no charge and no hassle. I had to get the phone battery replaced earlier this year and the Apple techy said he has not seen a 2 year old phone in better condition. I would definitely buy another one but there are a few limitations that may also be present with the Samsung version. First of all, the headphone jack requires the use of an adapter which is included with the case, but does necessitate you bringing the adapter wherever you go. There is a workaround by using Bluetooth headphones or getting a bluetooth receiver. Secondly, the thickness of the case does not allow me to use many (perhaps any) of the docking stations out there. The Apple charging cables (and some other manufacturers) work fine but the docking stations don't fit. Probably less of an issue with a Samsung phone since there are fewer Samsung docks on the market. Sound quality when on the phone is better with this newer case. Keep in mind that the touchscreen doesn't work when wet so taking pictures/videos requires a workaround. When shooting underwater with an Iphone, the volume buttons work to start/stop photo/video recording.  Obvious pros - drop the phone and it should survive. Waterproof in case your phone takes a dip. If you have kids, also makes cleaning greasy fingerprints off the screen really easy. I will try and post an underwater video I took last month in the next day or so.  I also have the Nuud model for my Ipad. Works great. Worry free especially with a 4 year old.  Jon"

896978,manitoubass2,2015-02-09 18:33:00,11391,Found this for the s5's out there. Good reviews and great price.  Im gonna try this one out  
896979,manitoubass2,2015-02-09 18:36:00,11391,My daughter still uses my old lifeproof for iphone 4 and if done properly it is indeed waterproof.  Not that id recommend it but she uses hers is the shower to belt out one direction tunes lol
896984,Bill Shearer,2015-02-09 19:04:00,456,"If the previous recommendations have not made up your mind, I too have the Lifeproof case, and will buy no other. Their warranty assistance is excellent. Jon summed it up perfectly with the pros and cons. Spend the money, get the Lifeproof. No regrets."

898248,grizzlybri,2015-02-15 17:07:00,565,"very cool video thanks for sharing as for the case I have a Heavy Duty Otter box for mine, however it is NOT waterproof, but it has saved my phone more times then i can count and has he battle scars to prove it, but my phone is fine"
