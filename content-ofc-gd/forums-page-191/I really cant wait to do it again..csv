No matter if my buddy joined me,or I went solo.  It,s very calming and made me feel, FREE? I wasnt tied to looking for a launch or buying gas. I just drove to my spot,blew up the toon,loaded it up and off I flipped or rowed my way to fishing spots.  It,s amazing how much area you can cover when your into it. One time I fished like 2 hours and when I turned around I said holly,I went that far already.  Being fairly close to water level,the veiw is totally different then being up say 2-3 ft above and feet firmly planted. No snapping turtles right at your side saying hello,are those your toes? More friendlier wild life like ducks and geese and beavers were nice to see.   Just some videos I have posted before but I like to go back and watch them. Keeps me looking forward to this coming soft water.  Some are cool,some are kooky. Ya like thats a surprise.LOL As I have said before,if you aint laughing and out enjoying,why bother being here on earth. Enjoy your life to the fullest you can.  ONE DAY AT A TIME,BUT TREAT IT AS YOUR LAST DAY OF YOUR TIME.                    As I said,cant wait to get out again. Again cant come soon enough."

898170,grizzlybri,2015-02-15 01:19:00,565,"wells looks like I commented before you were finished. I'm going to have to go watch the other ones now.  No problem B, keep up the great work on the videos"
898178,spincast,2015-02-15 01:34:00,3279,"'ONE DAY AT A TIME,BUT TREAT IT AS YOUR LAST DAY OF YOUR TIME.' exactly!!!!!! great stuff B. Warm sun, soft water and the only ice around in my cooler or drink. Can get here soon enough."
898185,misfish,2015-02-15 01:54:00,29133,"Beware of treble hooks. Yes thankfully,they didnt hook in the toon. Smallie that took a top water on Couch. Got it close enough to say I gone.LOL     "

898194,wkrp,2015-02-15 03:13:00,656,"Too cool, fantastic"
898197,ckewley,2015-02-15 04:31:00,699,"Ya man I got myself a ""toon"" last year as well, although a bit different than yours. Normally I chase trout (small creek) through the summer. but last year I expanded that quite a bit. I put a 2.5 Merc on this thing & while nowhere near as portable as yours had allot of fun. Can't wait till soft water season, truth told I'm thinking of going to a Kayak (Hobie) though for next year"
