897803,Rod Caster,2015-02-13 02:37:00,5784,"Joey, my Wife and I slogged it out on a slushy, stocked back lake. We all got wet and cold. Luckily I brought the 2-man eskimo and propane heater, so she stayed warm and happy.  After a couple dozen 3"" perch, the tiny jigging rap I was using to cause a perch-rucus ended up calling in a nice Rainbow!  I was a happy customer, especially given my poor record for inland rainbows.   "
