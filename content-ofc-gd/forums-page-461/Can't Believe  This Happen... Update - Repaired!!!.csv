647335,Sinker,2011-12-11 15:13:00,8692,You gotta start making them out of hardwood if your going to be throwing them around like that!!  I make all mine out of hardwood. Usually cherry...only because I have it around. They don't break!!  S.
647363,Leecher,2011-12-11 16:49:00,7832," I used Lepage carpenters glue to bind both pieces together   DOH   Make up your mind eh??  It's black & white   Shane, I'm usually careful handling them and never had any broke on me but this time it slip my grip.... ah well it's all good now, I've just finished repairing it... as good as new   ***** UPDATE Repaired and as good as new   *****  I got to it this morning and decided to glue both pieces together with carpenters glue.... gave it a couple of hours to dry.  Then I tried the cheese cloth wrap around approach but didn't work as expected so decided to use braid like Art had suggested  But before I could tie the braid on, created 4 little notches so that the braid would fit in and not slip.  Then I tied on using a Uni knot, cut the tag ends and applied 2 coats of glue to secure it.  Then applied a coat of paint to hide as much as possible the braid and then a coat of varnish for protection  Results.... AS GOOD AS NEW   Here's a couple of pics    Closer look.... you can actually see the braid here in white    Thanks again to everyone for all the suggestions... I'm ready to go fishing and happy"
647379,Tybo,2011-12-11 18:04:00,1373,"I stop using all other glues, and now just use gorilla glue for every thing. I have use this to glue head liners foam to steel. I have used it to repair a broken transducer. I have used it to repair broken joy sticks on heavy equipment. I have used it to repair the plastic tanks on rads. I used it to repair my favored coffee bucket.Which goes in the dish washer."
647396,Leecher,2011-12-11 19:11:00,7832," So what you're telling me, Gorilla glue is the way to go.... OK, I'm good with that   Thanks Tybo"
647510,Nipfisher,2011-12-12 01:41:00,2449,"Jacques, if that one catches more fish than the others I'd break a few more of them. Repair job looks great."
647633,Leecher,2011-12-12 15:58:00,7832, Thanks Blair!!! I'll be keeping a close eye on that
647870,skeeter,2011-12-13 03:33:00,1907,"Would it not have been easier to just throw the broken tip ups in the corner and make new ones? Better still, keep the one's your making for GBW and send him the broken one. Tell him to keep track of all the fish he catches with it so you can see how long the repair last's. With the amount of fish he catches ( or lack there of) you can say the repair lasts a life time.  :tease:"
647872,GBW,2011-12-13 03:35:00,8460,"oh skeeter, I'll get you for that..."
647877,Leecher,2011-12-13 03:44:00,7832, It sure is skeet... but these are unique and not found in any store     why I made the repair  lol
647878,Skipper D,2011-12-13 03:54:00,1970,"I have a habit Jacque when i make a  repair to some thing that broke ,when its fixed and to test the repair i go back and try to break it again the same way it did the first time , did you do dat jack ? ........ lol"

648140,Leecher,2011-12-14 00:42:00,7832," No I haven't Skipper... even if I try, don't think I can make a clean cut like that LOL  and now it's got 15Lbs powerpro around it   Right on dude"
648152,vinnimon,2011-12-14 01:00:00,2593,  And a better warranty than shimano:thumbsup_anim:  The best god darn tippups ive ever used:thumbsup_anim:

647123,Leecher,2011-12-10 22:45:00,7832,"Today was going through my ice fishing gear and all was good until one of my tipup slip my grip and landed on the concret floor and broke in half  Gosh darn.... got to hate that when it happens      As you can see, no way to repair this one Ah well guess I'll be busy in the workshop again Leechman"
647124,irishfield,2011-12-10 22:47:00,26272,Reach for the glue Jacque !!
647127,ckrb2007,2011-12-10 22:49:00,449,Yep....Gorilla glue and a few brads will fix 'er right up.
647128,woodenboater,2011-12-10 22:50:00,2277,and some screws and yer laffing
647129,Rod Caster,2011-12-10 22:50:00,5784,"If mine break that way, are they warrantied??  That sucks Jacques. At least you can reuse the reel assembly.  "
647130,Spiel,2011-12-10 22:52:00,9065,2 part 24 hour cure epoxy will mend that just fine Jacques.
647133,davey buoy,2011-12-10 22:58:00,5505,How about a bit of PL Premium?
647136,irishfield,2011-12-10 23:14:00,26272,  Jacque's speech pattern or the rod??
647137,Leecher,2011-12-10 23:26:00,7832," That was my first thought Wayne... but will glue hold up in freezing temps??   Again... will glue hold in freezing temps??   Can't put screws in cause there's a hole for the line to go thru   No worries Chad... If yours brake, it's warrantied for life   That good advice Chris!!!  Will epoxy hold in freezing temps?   Don't know what PL premium is   Now that was funny Wayne"
647139,mercman,2011-12-10 23:34:00,7054,"Once the glu is dry, no worries.Go with the epoxy that Chris mentioned.Put 2 thin brad nails through on each side of the line chanel and clamp it to get out the air pockets."
647164,Whitespinnerbait,2011-12-11 00:38:00,2038,"Jacques!.....throw that thing in the Garbage,i'll sneak over later, and haul it away for ya"

647170,farsider,2011-12-11 00:51:00,456,"The epoxy will repair the bond stronger than the original wood(as will most woodworker's glues).  If you want to reinforce the area so it won't break again just a few fibres north or south of the repair, a couple of brads or pins as mentioned would probably do the trick(although splitting might be an issue), or you could whip around the outside of the area like rodbuilders do. Spiel would know more.  Cheers, Mark"

647172,limeyangler,2011-12-11 00:55:00,5204,thats why i never buy that dodgy French crap........
647189,aplumma,2011-12-11 01:23:00,6896,Take the joint with a chip brush (disposable glue brush) that has been dipped in water brush both sides with Gorilla outdoor glue. Apply pressure with clamps and allow to dry. The next time it breaks it will be anywhere other than the glue line. If you want to add something to it you can apply glue to the outside of the repair and wrap it with braid fishing line after it dries apply clear nail polish or thread sealer. I would use caution with brads or screws both damage the wood fibers and instead clamp it till the glue dries.   Art
647190,dhickey,2011-12-11 01:23:00,1038,Before you through it out you might want to try this. 1. glue it back together useing exterior wood glue(not to much) if you dont have clamps just wrap masking tape around it a few times then let it harden for a couple hours.  2. this is the fun part. Get in your car and drive to your favorate fishing store to buy epoxy resin(the type used on reparing eyelets on fishing rods) try not to get distracted.  3. when you get home take the tape off sand it lightly(220 grit)find some braided line and wrap it tightly around the glue joint then aply the epoxy this will make it 10 times stronger.  You might want to use the shank of a drill bit to put in the hole where your line goes through when you glue it back together so the excess glue doesnt inhibit your line latter.   Good luck hope this helps.
647205,Leecher,2011-12-11 02:00:00,7832," Epoxy is what I'm going to use but nails are out of the question because the wood is dry and don't want to cause more damage... Appreciate your input Paul      Temporary fix but should work while the epoxy dries   Thanks Mark for your input!!!      Hey now that's not nice   Thanks Art, that's some solid advice   Thanks saltydawg for the sound advice"
647213,DRIFTER_016,2011-12-11 02:16:00,10439,Glue and a hose clamp.
647224,Leecher,2011-12-11 02:32:00,7832," Thanks Dave   What I don't want to do is add weight to affect the balance of the top... Glue, epoxy and a clamp sounds good to me"
647235,Daplumma,2011-12-11 02:55:00,1961,Couple of drywall screws and Bobs yer uncle...Art had a good idea also..Gorilla glue! Joe
647238,mercman,2011-12-11 03:02:00,7054,"Nails can be a bad idea if you dont do it right Jacques. That looks like a good hard wood, so for lateral strength, drill pilot holes, put a drop of epoxy on the Brad nail tips, and slide them into the pilot holes."
647241,Leecher,2011-12-11 03:17:00,7832," Thanks Joe   Paul, the wood is pine and very dry since I build those tipups a couple of years ago, so nails are not an option... just afraid it would split if I insert nails even pre drilling holes... but here's what I'm going to do and think it's going to work just fine:  Glue both pieces together and clamp it down, let it dry.... then dip a strip of cheese cloth (about 1/4"" wide) in glue and wrap it around and let it dry... then apply a thin coat of apoxy, sand and re paint  I think that might just work fine.  Thanks again everyone for your input, much appreciated"
647302,mercman,2011-12-11 13:15:00,7054, I think you are right Sounds like it will be good as new when you finish with it.
