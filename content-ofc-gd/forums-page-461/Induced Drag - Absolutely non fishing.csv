647435,irishfield,2011-12-11 20:58:00,26272,"I've been asked a few hundred times or more why I fly with the boat ""backwards"" on my airplane. Came across this today.. and it pretty much tells the tale, as the boat is semi streamline going backwards.. it's not going pointy end first! 2.6 times more draggy going what many would think is the correct way. Your dynamics knowledge for today....  <iframe width=""420"" height=""315"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/ftq8jTQ8ANE"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>"
647437,Roy,2011-12-11 21:17:00,13728,I wonder if he knew that one day he'd be on the interweebs?
647442,kickingfrog,2011-12-11 21:36:00,8333,I remember seeing a clip years ago were a model T was more aerodynamic going backwards than it was going forward.

647485,Tom McCutcheon,2011-12-12 00:06:00,627,"I understand the idea of the aerodynamics Wayne but I am having a hard time picturing where or how you place the boat on the plane. Have you a photo to help me out?  Certainly not the way I would have done it and that is why I leave the flying to the pro's,"
647492,irishfield,2011-12-12 00:26:00,26272,>> 
647650,Tom McCutcheon,2011-12-12 17:12:00,627,Thank you sir.  I suppose that a person unacustomed to flying into remote lakes might think that you were a very wise pilot to carry his own life boat
647651,ch312,2011-12-12 17:15:00,1590, it must be different for different styles of vehicles. i remember watching a mythbusters episode where they tested this myth and discovered that the car was in fact more aerodynamic going forwards.
647658,mercman,2011-12-12 17:31:00,7054,Physics They also proved that a Pickup with the taligate closed is more efficient than having it open.
647675,fishnsled,2011-12-12 18:37:00,3520, You might (but not likely) have had convinced if it was an airplane forum but a fishing forum.... Cool video Wayne.
647729,kickingfrog,2011-12-12 20:49:00,8333," I saw the mythbusters episode as well, can't remember the turd of a car they used for that one. And it was specific to that vehicle that some speculated that is was more areodynamic backwards.   The original one with the pre 1950's car showed how much smoothly the air traveled off the ""back"" of the car while it was going backward."
647742,kickingfrog,2011-12-12 21:20:00,8333,     B Giesler & Sons Limited. Anybody hear of 'em? 
647747,irishfield,2011-12-12 21:25:00,26272," If I had the equivalent of 675 HP I wouldn't care which way I put it on either Rob. Probably the only way it fit his ""canoe"" rack!"
647752,Tybo,2011-12-12 21:43:00,1373,The best way to show drag is a submarine.The bow is much bigger the stern.
647755,irishfield,2011-12-12 21:52:00,26272,At least Ignace Air and Lakeland Airways know which way they go !! 
647775,GbayGiant,2011-12-12 23:22:00,1780,  They call that Pilot error and planes crash all the time. You just don't hear about it.
