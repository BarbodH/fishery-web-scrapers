647794,ccmtcanada,2011-12-13 00:16:00,7971,"I wanted to share a song my daughter and I recorded last week.  The vocals are done by my 9 year old and I recorded the guitar, bass guitar, drums (from a keyboard) and the other sounds.  She doesn't think her voice sounds very good, but I beg to differ!  I'm very proud of her...she's worked hard on her singing.  She allowed me to post the song, but refused to let me shoot a video of her singing! LOL  I didn't arrange this song...it's actually Miley Cyrus' version of the song...  Hope you enjoy!  <object width=""420"" height=""315""><param name=""movie"" value=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDADR16U4I0?version=3&hl=en_US""></param><param'>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDADR16U4I0?version=3&hl=en_US""></param><param name=""allowFullScreen"" value=""true""></param><param name=""allowscriptaccess"" value=""always""></param><embed src=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDADR16U4I0?version=3&hl=en_US"" type=""application/x-shockwave-flash"" width=""420"" height=""315"" allowscriptaccess=""always"" allowfullscreen=""true""></embed></object>"
