647748,Billy Bob,2011-12-12 21:26:00,5865, No we didn't....the friggin Indians did...
647749,Billy Bob,2011-12-12 21:28:00,5865,  Each department will have it's own qualifications depending on many circumstances....when you have a lot of man power to choose from you can operate different then from a small community.
647753,adolson,2011-12-12 21:44:00,783," Once every year or two is probably accurate here.  If three houses went up in flames every week, this entire town would be ashes in 2-3 years."
647770,lew,2011-12-12 22:55:00,12766," Wearing a mask is a basic thing for a firemen and is one of the 1st things their taught when they come on the job....at least in Canada anyways, and  I couldn't imagine a truck sitting and waiting in the firehall for qualified men to get there before they respond to a fire.  If it works for you guys, then OK I spose, just seems really odd to me. Not arguing with you Bob, just stating an opinion from someone who did it for alot of years."
647771,Billy Bob,2011-12-12 23:05:00,5865," I never thought we were arguing...just exchanging ideas and ways things are done here and there....again, professionals have a different way because they have full time men at the hall but are very limited to men because they are paid fire fighters.  Our department alone has the capacity of 240 fire fighters....we are the LARGEST in the state as far as I know when it comes to volunteers....it's the reason when a neighbouring district needs mutual aid we are the first to be called because they can depend on us.  BTW we NEVER lost a basement....LOL  Bob"
647777,lew,2011-12-12 23:28:00,12766," When I retired 11 years ago we had about 3000 men on the job in Toronto and if I remember correctly we were the 4th largest department in North America, behind New York, Los Angeles & Chicago.  And we saved most of the basements too   :lol:"
647778,Billy Bob,2011-12-12 23:34:00,5865, But how many were on duty per truck per day....I know in Buffalo (poor example) they only have 3 men on their trucks.  In some areas within NYS there are paid fire fighters who drive and operate the truck with volunteers manning the truck....so it all depends on where you live and how much money you have to throw around.  BTW our truck seats eight and many times it's full to capacity with more fire fighters arriving at the scene via their own vehicles....you can never have too much muscle at a working fire as I'm sure you know.  Bob
647783,smally21,2011-12-12 23:46:00,993,"are you in lancaster BB? 240 men is a big VFD - maybe not by american standards - dont know. our area has about 270 volunteers over about 10 stations, and 500 career in about 15 stations. similarly, volunteers wait for 3 men to respond. no distinction between interior/exterior.  it would be great to have a million beers and discuss the american volunteer system, i think its different in that larger communities, even cities will have volunteer protection vs canada where they switch to career the instant they can afford it! often when they can't  career fire only resonds 15 men to a residential structure fire here...to start anyway.  as for 3 times a week - well at 30,000 calls per year you are not far off , its more like 2% in our area, and some vehicles hitting 2500-4000 calls/year. sure not every guy is gonna have 3 a week, often go months without. but somebody is going to them, maybe 600 structure fires/year( just residential), average of 2/day  regrettably, lost a basement recently. we are still recovering"
647792,Billy Bob,2011-12-13 00:13:00,5865,"I belong to the Depew Fire Department....it's the largest village in NYS...  We have 6 companies with each company having a max of 40 men per company as per our department By-Laws...  Now those beer are going to be Cold Canadian Beer, right ? ? ?LOL...no I'm not kidding...LOL...I am well qualified to drink beer as it was a requirement to join...LOL  We average between 325-375 calls per year...we must make 10% to qualify for our Service Awards program.  I would love to discuss this further....but I have a fire police meeting at 7:30pm....yes, I no longer drag hose but instead direct traffic and secure the fire scene for my fellow fire fighters....momma didn't raise no fool...I knew when it was time to let the young bucks take over...but I'm still considered a 100% fire fighter in my department and I'm still qualified to drive and run the truck if need be...but gave up my green tag a couple years back for obvious reasons.  Keep it Safe, Bob"
647805,lew,2011-12-13 00:33:00,12766," When I went on the job in '68 Bob, I was working with a bunch of old men, but when I retired more than 3  decades later I was working with a bunch of kids.  Funny how that works out, eh ??"
647814,gaspumper,2011-12-13 00:52:00,393,"I thought this was a report about some unlucky family loosing there house,not a pissing match about which fireman can and can't enter a burning house."
647820,adolson,2011-12-13 01:15:00,783,"Hey, fire guys. This is may be a stupid question, but what good is ""saving a basement"" anyhow? Presumably it makes rebuilding easier, but there must be something more to it?  If that's the only thing, and my house burns but my basement is ""saved,"" it's of little use to me, as the town here probably wouldn't let me rebuild due to changes in the building code or bylaws or whatever. I own a lot that used to have a house on it, and I was told I would probably not be permitted to put a small garage on it now because of such issues.  Anyhow, I was just curious.  Why can't it be both? We feel bad for the people who lost their home, and see whose firehose is longer. Or something.. It's not the length of the hose, it's how much water it sprays!"
647847,dhickey,2011-12-13 02:15:00,1038,"Check your local codes and talk to the township. OLD foundations might not be allowd to biuld on but the ""foot print"" may be used if your willing to put a new foundation in thats up to code.  From my understanding at this piont in my carier whenever structural ellements are involved in renos or rebuilds. Any alteration to existing fundimental ellements must be brought up to existing code requirements and inspected. Involving enginieres/architechts and munnicaple code inspectors. $$  Having said that some townships dont realy have strict rules so do your home work regarding municaple building code requirements.  Caution should always be taken when altering foundation/framing/plumbing/water source!!! and septic for those that like rual comunities.  This is why they try to save foundations as it is the most expensive and important ellement of any structure."
647851,Rustic-Fisher,2011-12-13 02:20:00,826,"  BETTER check your facts bud, Toronto had 276,729 unit responses,  144,407 emergency calls and 40,767 ""FIRE CALLS"". Thats 28% actual fires. Far from 1% . R"
647853,danbouck,2011-12-13 02:24:00,4380, I don't see any pissing matches
647857,Grimace,2011-12-13 02:43:00,2020,"  Pretty sure they were just joking.  If your house burns to the ground the concrete basement is unscathed and useless.  Hence the joke, we saved the basement."
647896,adolson,2011-12-13 08:43:00,783,"  I thought that, but... The above reply seems to make some sense to me."
647899,lew,2011-12-13 10:04:00,12766," Dana ""Saving a basement"" is just more of an expression  used by firemen when a house is a total loss after a fire and nothing is salvagable other than the property."
647911,Billy Bob,2011-12-13 11:25:00,5865,"  When I hire out as a kid on the RR I looked around and saw all these old guys sitting at the lunch table before I started my first day on the job. I thought to myself, my God they look so old and worn out and the day hasn't even started yet. Then 30 years later I noticed all the green horns sitting at that same table thinking they are so young, they will never make it on the railroad....LOL"
647920,Billy Bob,2011-12-13 12:24:00,5865," My father had a old saying ""Figures lie and liars figure""...  The point is your 28% (if your math is correct) categorizes ""fire calls""... this does not mean there were actually 40,767 working fires in Toronto....if so, then Toronto would be the second most dangerous city to live in, only behind Buffalo....LOL"
648221,adolson,2011-12-14 04:44:00,783,"Well, the police and fire marshal finished up today, took down the police line tape, and I guess that's a wrap. They didn't ask me for a statement, despite telling me they would be around on Monday evening. I saw one of them today with some kind of device, touching the ground in many spots with it. I assume it was a hydrocarbon sniffer or something, but I don't have much knowledge of these things.  The news reported on this last night, and they said that the wife was injured in the initial explosion, but we saw her outside and she wasn't hurt in any major way, thankfully. I heard from someone who heard from someone who heard from someone that the initial blast was a hot water tank that exploded.  The wife is still mad that nobody cleaned all the of tons of broken glass out of our driveway. I am glad our house didn't burn down."
648246,bubbles,2011-12-14 12:20:00,591,"I am glad nobody was hurt  I rarely read 3 page posts from beginning to end but I enjoyed this one, thanks for the education fireguys!"

648323,adolson,2011-12-14 16:14:00,783, In their hot water tank?
647602,adolson,2011-12-12 14:37:00,783,"Pics of my neighbor's house, taken from my kitchen window (except the last one, taken from my upstairs window):                    Took the fire department a whole 4, maybe 5 minutes to arrive from the first sign of smoke. I was impressed. Yet, that was not enough to save the house whatsoever. They fought it for about 5 hours or so. Police tape sectioned off the portion of the street beside my house and a cop was posted all night.  It sure sucks for that family. I am not aware of an official cause as of yet, but I'm really curious considering how things went down... There's glass all the way across the street to the side of my house. The fire marshal is coming to investigate today, and will probably talk to me."
647603,bassman87,2011-12-12 14:40:00,586,Hope everyones okay and had good insurance. sucks that it happened so close to the holiday season also.
647606,lew,2011-12-12 14:46:00,12766,"Check your smoke detectors folks, you don't have alot of time to get out once the fire gets going, specially when it happens in the middle of the night.  Hope everyone made it out safely."
647607,Roy,2011-12-12 14:47:00,13728,So I presume that no one was injured?
647613,Billy Bob,2011-12-12 14:56:00,5865,"If no one was injured, then that's all that counts....insurance will replace ""things"" but no one can replace a life.  As most but not all fires....STUPID acts are usually involved....  ESPECIALLY during the Christmas Season....THINK and don't take chances with wiring, candles (the #1 fire cause) and fires in the fireplace or wood burning stove...over the 30 years as a volunteer fire fighter I have seen so MANY fires that should of been prevented.  PLACE IT SAFE and have a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year.  Bob"
647615,ecmilley,2011-12-12 14:57:00,2163,sounds like everyone is ok? houses can be rebuilt people no so much terrible to be happening this time of year
647617,johnnyb,2011-12-12 15:03:00,3413,So sad to see someone's home destroyed...glad that everyone is ok from the sounds of it
647628,Joey,2011-12-12 15:47:00,9122,"Wow, that is brutal Dana.  Thanks for sharing the pictures and this is a reminder, plese be careful people and as Lew said, check smoke detectors every few months.  Hope everyone is okay.  Keep us updated please!"
647630,Leecher,2011-12-12 15:54:00,7832,That really sucks big time    especially being so close to the holiday season. Leechman
647644,adolson,2011-12-12 16:48:00,783,"Yes, all three people got out fine (edit: news says minor injuries for the wife, from the blast), and I think they got their pet(s) out too.  Cruiser is still parked in the middle of the street, and the cops will be around later to get our account of the explosion and following events."
647645,lew,2011-12-12 16:55:00,12766," Dana, was there an actual explosion before the fire or could you have heard the noise of the windows blowing out ??  Alot of pressure builds up inside a house while a fire is burning, specially this time of year when the building is closed up tight against the cold weather. Once the pressure is high enough, it'll blow out the windows and sometimes that can be pretty loud.  Coppers will probably ask the same question."
647659,adolson,2011-12-12 17:38:00,783," I tried typing up a reply three or four times.. I can't get the wording to how I want it, as I don't want to go into much more detail in public.  As for your specific question, I don't know - and that's not for me to figure out, thankfully. I know what I heard and what I saw, and how it fits together is up to someone else to piece together."
647674,mercman,2011-12-12 18:27:00,7054,Always a shame to see and hear of this kind of thing so close to Christmas.Thank god all are safe.

647691,fishing n autograph,2011-12-12 19:26:00,2540,Glad everyone got out okay....let's hope for a Christmas miracle...
647693,Billy Bob,2011-12-12 19:33:00,5865,We learned the hard way (once) that during a suspicious  fire we now leave a hose in the house and wrapped it around  the fire hydrant to secure the fire scene to the FIRE DEPARTMENT in case we need to go back in there for investigation. This is enough to legally say we are not turning the property over to the owner.
647695,smally21,2011-12-12 19:38:00,993,quite a burner. an older home becomes free burining in minutes - especially with a few windows out. and officers dont need SCBAs i guess.
647698,Billy Bob,2011-12-12 19:47:00,5865, Exterior Fire Fighters are not required to wear SCBA's and they are needed for interior fire fighters...you have to remember there are only so many SCBA's to go around at a fire scene. Also exterior fire fighters are just important even though they are not qualified to wear SCBA's and fight from the inside of the fire.
647702,smally21,2011-12-12 20:01:00,993,"not gonna get into this with you Billy Bob. you can't even see the guy through the smoke  -show that pic to WSIB. might be alright if you get a fire once a year but how long you going to live doing that 3 times a week?  and is it hard to imagine an exterior firefighter being required to enter the building - what do you do go back to the truck and finish getting your gear on while your buddy or a victim dies inside? condtions change you switch to interior attack from exterior attack and you are standing there at the door with half your gear on?  i beleive NFPA standard is one scba/firefighter to qualify the apparatus as a fire engine/pump  sorry just reread - you have firefighters at the scene of a fire not qualified to wear an scba - i had no idea. different rules i suppose. kind of changes the deal for what i said above, wasn't aware there was such a thing as exterior and interior firefighters. not in ontario. or at least not to OFM standards for front line firefighting. interesting.   i guess i am getting into it with you. no, no, i won't. not gonna do it no matter what you say."
647721,lew,2011-12-12 20:30:00,12766, Never heard of such a thing  What happens if the guys inside need help in a hurry and you've got un-qualified guys outside who cant wear a mask and can't enter the building ??
647725,adolson,2011-12-12 20:41:00,783,"Whoa, guys. This is a pretty small house, and there were 6 hoses going at one point, that I could see from my window. It was hard to count all the firefighters, but there were at least a dozen at one point, many outside, some inside. They were here very quick to get here too, and I believe (not 100% sure on this) they're volunteers. This is a small town, and I recognized the names on at least three of them (probably went to school with a son or brother of theirs). They were here all day, one or two of them (one who knocked on my door to ask if he could use my power... No, you may not! Who do you think I am, Ontario Hydro!?? ) are out there again today with the marshal and OPP.  I have much respect for them, and I was in awe of watching them work tirelessly for probably 6 hours. They controlled and contained the fire, and despite a report I read online, to my knowledge the fire did not spread to trees and telephone poles (something my mom read and panicked about). In fact, the house right next door looks untouched (the roof practically overhangs the other house. Separated by just a sidewalk). My house heated up pretty good, and our power (therefore heat) was out for hours, so it had to be pretty hot outside too."
647726,Headhunter,2011-12-12 20:43:00,5703,They name it Tonawanda Lew! HH
647734,Sebastian,2011-12-12 21:06:00,208, 3 times a week? Less than 1% of a fire departments call volume is an actual fire. Once a year is more of an accurate number.
647741,misfish,2011-12-12 21:17:00,29133,"Sad at anytime of year,but at christmas is the worst.     I found that kinda wierd aswell Lew. As a vollunteer,all members were trained and qualified to use SCBA's."
647743,Billy Bob,2011-12-12 21:24:00,5865," Are you a professional Fire Fighter ? ? ? ...if so then that explains why your post is so different then mine.  I am a volunteer fire fighter and our rules differ from pro's not because we are less qualified but maybe because we have a LOT more man power to select from.  Our trucks per department rule doe NOT roll unless there are three green tags (interior fire fighters) on board....and we have 6 trucks plus a heavy rescue truck in our department alone....if it's a working house fire we immediately request mutual aid from neighbouring fire departments. Some are asked to respond to the fire scene while others are asked to man our vacant fire halls just in case another call comes from our territory.  So with a minimum of 3 green tags times 6 trucks we have 18 qualified and highly trained interior fire fighters at the scene and if it's a working house fire more help is on the way. Exterior fire fighters are used to help man outside hose...drag hose, connect hose, etc....this frees up our green tags and keeps them fresh for a inside attack if need be.  So what do you think....do we have our bases covered.....our company has been doing this for over 100 years and never lost a fire fighter, Thank God...  Keep Safe, Bob"
