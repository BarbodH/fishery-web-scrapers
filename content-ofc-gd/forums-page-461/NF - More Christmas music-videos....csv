The two I have are O Holy Night and Silent Night.  O Holy Night starts out acoustic and then slowly builds to an all out ""Pink Floyd/Trans Siberian Orchestra"" kind of sound.  The video shows how I used the keyboard for piano, strings and drums.  I use a real bass guitar instead of the keyboards.  My acoustic guitar is a Fender semi acoustic and my electric is an old Ibanez Roadstar.  Both guitars are well over 20 years old and have been used quite extensively!  <object width=""420"" height=""315""><param name=""movie"" value=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqvfFa8znEA?version=3&hl=en_US""></param><param'>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqvfFa8znEA?version=3&hl=en_US""></param><param name=""allowFullScreen"" value=""true""></param><param name=""allowscriptaccess"" value=""always""></param><embed src=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqvfFa8znEA?version=3&hl=en_US"" type=""application/x-shockwave-flash"" width=""420"" height=""315"" allowscriptaccess=""always"" allowfullscreen=""true""></embed></object>  Silent Night is an all acoustic version...with some bass guitar added at the end for a richer...more full sound.  There are 3 acoustic guitar parts...I add one layer each time a new verse starts.  <object width=""420"" height=""315""><param name=""movie"" value=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N347vJNWx3M?version=3&hl=en_US""></param><param'>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N347vJNWx3M?version=3&hl=en_US""></param><param name=""allowFullScreen"" value=""true""></param><param name=""allowscriptaccess"" value=""always""></param><embed src=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N347vJNWx3M?version=3&hl=en_US"" type=""application/x-shockwave-flash"" width=""420"" height=""315"" allowscriptaccess=""always"" allowfullscreen=""true""></embed></object>   Both songs were recorded with an audio editing program called Audacity.  Each track is recorded separately in the process and then mixed afterwards.  I am thinking of doing another instrumental this year...any suggestions???  Hope you enjoy! Thanks for watching!  Edited to add:  If anyone would like mp3 versions, PM me with your email address and I'll be happy to send them to you.  Let me know which ones you'd like...including Rockin Around the Christmas Tree."
