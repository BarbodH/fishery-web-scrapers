Things got started this morning by Snow white wanting to take a trip down to Hamilton to see the Red deer that was holding up a good fishing cottage rental business that was pointing a bag of roe at the police , but first she had to stop off at the wader repair shop when the truck started making a strange sound which turned out to be the radiator making a little boilie . It was a bit cold out but she was ok because she was wearing sled hand warmers which are a  pair of thin gloves and decided to walk with  Her friend Crosby who was suffering from a headache but said he would be ok if people would just quit asking him legal questions about skunks chasing pike thingeys . Both of them could not help noticing the new bill board which had just been put up in town which read Welcome to the OFC car show , happening this weekend featuring  the latest rods built with a super v8's and musky stik four speeds and Door prizes to be given away at the event such as , fishing knifes , senko worms from canadian tire , under water camera tripods , ice augers from costco , and a one late night commercial recording session for 2 minutes about bein a kid that would air at UFC TONIGHT . With three grand prize to be draws , one for a  Ice fishing trip , a tent garage and a free ST Croix repair . After reading this they were both having mixed reviews on weather or not  they could make it because it conflicted with the Notty water show where some guy was going to be making his debut with a flying suite and wondered if it might give misconceptions to nonfisher people by using the suite to ice watch from way up . They were both hoping to get some tips from those who did it themselves and then try it over Ontario to see if any thing was fishable . Then both looked at one another at the same time laughing at knowing that this was out of the question because some one had just drained the great lakes and where they going to put the 100,000 fish that was raised by the radio program ...what song are you listening to right now ? and the Last Fall Outing Report from the Bay of Quinte. Skunked they both were and decided to hell with all the shows  that were going on and  the red deer and go for another outing and a new pb by helping a neibour who had just lost their house and figure out the up coming repair bill and how this would induce drag on Christmas for every one in town . At the same time running into another neibour on the side walk who had just been attacked by another neibours dog and when asked if he was ok replyed , do you think i have a problem , remarking that he was only trying to do a little shore fishing because he had just winterized the boat  then he was planning to go watch Sinclairs new ice hut build that he was making to fit his fluorcarbon line junk in . The good news for this small town is that its still growing and next year they are hoping to host the EXPO PT Reels event from Quantum , any one have working links for this , or any Cameras for still movies that would help to get this event off the ground would be greatly appreiciated . You know what they say .. One step at a time , we are all proud and Can't believe this happens right here between the Midland  and the  Bayfeild rivers and soon to air on the Discovery Channel ..  NEXT !"
