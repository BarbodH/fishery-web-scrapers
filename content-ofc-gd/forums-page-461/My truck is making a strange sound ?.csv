646323,tomO,2011-12-08 00:17:00,363,"I've got a 2000 chevy silverado4x4, the last couple of weeks theres a sound like gurgling water in the passenger side dash. At first it it would just make the sound when i first got in and drove it would go away after a short time but now it keeps getting longer and longer before it disipates. Any ideas? thx."
646325,Bernie,2011-12-08 00:20:00,3190,"Hi Tom. Check your coolant level. There is air going through the heater hose lines. Before, as your coolant expanded it would improve. You have a coolant leak somewhere."
646327,HTHM,2011-12-08 00:29:00,4082,What Bernie says or just turn up your radio and you won't hear it any more.   :lol:
646328,misfish,2011-12-08 00:31:00,29133,  
646329,tomO,2011-12-08 00:32:00,363,Ok thx a lot bernie. I never thought of that but then again I'm not a mechanic.
646335,BillM,2011-12-08 00:42:00,17367,"I've got a slight leak at my t-stat on my S10, I get the exact same noise..   It's been a while, lol."
646371,ccmtcanada,2011-12-08 03:15:00,7971,"I have the same issue in my car, but every time I check the coolant, it's topped up....."
646409,cuzza,2011-12-08 12:50:00,467,"If there's air trapped in the system, the level wouldn't necessarily drop. You can go round the bleed screws with the system hot and get all the air out (carefully!) then top the level up when it cools. If it starts doing it again, you have a leak. Next job is to find it - that's where the fun starts! "
646410,Guest chase4chrome,2011-12-08 12:56:00,0,Have you checked your basement for pods???
646742,ecmilley,2011-12-09 13:20:00,2163,"my seirra did that as well, turned out it was the smallest of leaks in the waterpump, check lower rad hose and see if there is a stain there or on block under pump"
646962,tomO,2011-12-10 01:30:00,363,"I haven't had time to check it out good but the fluid level was low and I added some anti freeze it seemed to help it. I'll check it closer when I get a day off ,thx again every one."
646986,vance,2011-12-10 03:19:00,719,"I chased a similar problem with mine and it turned out to be a crack in the rad side tank that leaked, but as a vapor so there was no evidence of coolant leaking anywhere.  vance"
647019,Tybo,2011-12-10 07:13:00,1373,Tom Check your Oil Right away for coolant.Very bad if it is.
647055,Bernie,2011-12-10 16:03:00,3190, Great point Paul!
647141,tomO,2011-12-10 23:36:00,363,"Ok Tybo I'll check it, I suppose your thinking cracked block? Hope not the trucks only got 80 thousand on it ."
647153,BillM,2011-12-11 00:08:00,17367, Head gasket.
647232,tomO,2011-12-11 02:49:00,363,"There would be a lot of white smoke coming out of the tail pipe if that were the case ,or am I wrong?  "
647234,BillM,2011-12-11 02:52:00,17367, Depends on where the leak is...  I've seen headgaskets go and the only sign was oil in the coolant... No coolant or anything making it into the combustion chamber.
647237,Bernie,2011-12-11 02:57:00,3190,Water pumps are real common. These engines seem to be holding up well internally. Just get it checked to make sure.
647316,Billy Bob,2011-12-11 14:08:00,5865,"A simple leakage test of the cooling system can tell you if you have a leak...take it to a mechanic that can pressurize the system....that will tell you right away if the cooling system has a leak...finding it is another matter...might even have to have a cylinder leakage test done...but that's a rare thing for a coolant leak but can sometimes find it.  To get the air out of the system drive around with the radiator cap loose to vent the system once it becomes hot...take some extra coolant with you just in case.  BTW I believe this truck has ""deathcool"" (Dexcool) for a anti-freeze....bad stuff as it shortens the life of head gaskets and intake manifold gaskets.   Bob"
647380,Tybo,2011-12-11 18:12:00,1373,Get it fixed as soon as possible.Coolent leaks can create vapor lock. No better way to cause major damage to your engine.(MOTOR  )
647449,tomO,2011-12-11 22:01:00,363,Well boys I dont see any thing unusual in the oil not foamy or anything and the coolant hasnt went down at all from when I topped it off a couple days ago but I'll have it checked anyway. thx again. .
