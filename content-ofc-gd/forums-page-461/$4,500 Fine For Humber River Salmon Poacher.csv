648122,Ron,2011-12-13 23:54:00,1683,"$4,500 Fine For Humber River Salmon Poacher  NEWS December 12, 2011  A Toronto man has been fined $4,500 for illegal salmon fishing at the Old Mill Dam on the Humber River.  Stephan Tymchyshyn, of Etobicoke, pleaded guilty to charges under the Fish and Wildlife Conservation Act and the Ontario Fishery Regulations. In addition to the fine, his fishing licence has been suspended for two years and his fishing equipment has been permanently forfeited. Previous fishing convictions were considered in handing down this sentence.  The court heard that on the evening of October 8, 2011, Ministry of Natural Resources conservation officers found Tymchyshyn fishing in the Humber River immediately below the Old Mill Dam, in an area that is closed to fishing. Tymchyshyn was found to be in possession of illegal fish snagging equipment and two pails of fish roe.  Justice of the Peace David R. Keilty heard the case in the Ontario Court of Justice in Toronto, on December 1, 2011.  Migratory fish, such as rainbow trout and salmon, are vulnerable to poaching when they congregate in the pools at the base of dams while moving upstream to spawn. Signs posted at the Old Mill Dam remind anglers that no fishing is permitted within 60 metres downstream of the dam.  To report a natural resources violation, call 1-877-TIPS-MNR (847-7667) toll-free any time or contact your local ministry office during regular business hours. You can also call Crime Stoppers anonymously at 1-800-222-TIPS (8477)."
