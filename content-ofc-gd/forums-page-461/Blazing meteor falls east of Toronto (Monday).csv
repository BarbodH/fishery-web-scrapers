648335,GBW,2011-12-14 17:28:00,8460,"Ontario researchers want to hear from anyone who saw a basketball-sized fireball in the sky east of Toronto Monday night or has found fragments of the fallen meteorites.  The meteor, described as a ""slow-moving fireball, estimated to be no bigger than a basketball,"" was recorded at 6:04 p.m. ET Monday by six cameras that are part of the University of Western Ontario's Southern Ontario Meteor Network, the university said in a news release.  Researchers think it likely dropped meteorites ranging in size from one gram to hundreds of grams east of Selwyn, Ont., north of Peterborough, near the end of Upper Stony Lake, about 115 kilometres northeast of Toronto. They may have a total mass of up to a few kilograms.  While the meteor fell during the Geminid meteor shower, researchers said it wasn't related to that event.  Because researchers tracked the meteor's trajectory with their cameras, they can figure out where in our solar system it comes from. They say it is rare and valuable to be able to combine that information with an actual meteorite sample.  ""Finding a meteorite from a fireball captured by video is equivalent to a planetary sample return mission,"" said Peter Brown, director of the University of Western Ontario's Centre for Planetary and Space Exploration, in a statement Wednesday.  ""Only about a dozen previous meteorite falls have had their orbits measured by cameras â€¦ so each new recovered meteorite is adding to our understanding of the formation and evolution of our own solar system.""  The video footage showed that the meteor first entered the atmosphere at an angle of 25 degrees from the horizontal, moving at 14 kilometres per second. It first became visible over Lake Erie, then moved toward the north-northeast and was visible until it reached an altitude of 31 kilometres, when it was just south of Selwyn.    Hey Lew (and others in the area)  If you go out today have a look around for it...  "

648354,dave524,2011-12-14 18:37:00,4508," Think it is ""finders keepers"" we had one hit here a couple of years ago, the fields were abuzz with searchers. Biggest chunk took out the windshield of a car so it was and easy find, but wasn't identified till later. They found 13 pieces in total but up there where this one fell don't think they will get as lucky.  http://www.lpi.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2010/pdf/2716.pdf"
