645799,spincast,2011-12-06 10:37:00,3279,"The semi final round of votes for this very worthwhile project is now underway. If you enjoy fishing for  Coho, Chrome or Browns in Lake O and its tribs, here's your chance to help contribute to the fishery in a meaningful way. And it will take nothing more than a couple mouse clicks a day to do so.  A couple comments from the MEA on the effort : The proposalâ€™s main focus would be the Continuation of the Entire Coho Salmon Stocking Program for Lake Ontario. This represents about 60,000 to 80,000 yearling fish stocked directly into our local Greater Toronto Area watershed and into Lake Ontario.  We will also be raising 25 000 Brown Trout and 17 000 Rainbow Trout. All species are destined for stocking into local area streams and rivers.  Please take a second to help out this worthwhile cause and show the MNR how important stocking programs are to the Angling communities. You can support once per day per email address. registered There is some pretty stiff competition as we get to the final rounds. Thanks MEA Stocking  Some samples of the end product attached     "
