647381,Ron,2011-12-11 18:16:00,1683,"Hey all,  Does anyone have or has tried the remote underwater camera tripods?  I am thinking of picking one up for ice fishing as I have noticed in the past, you can have the camera set up and either a fish swims by or when you hook into a fish the camera swings and then have to spend a fair amount of time setting it back up to get your field of view again.  So, if anyone has any experience or preferences on which brand to get, where to get them, that would be greatly appreciated.   Cheers, Ron..."

647388,kickingfrog,2011-12-11 18:34:00,8333,How does the tri pod get down the hole?
647389,Terry,2011-12-11 18:36:00,14456,"kidding right..LOL  the tripod straddles the hole and turns the cable which turns the camera, which faces the fish, which bites the hook that jack built"
