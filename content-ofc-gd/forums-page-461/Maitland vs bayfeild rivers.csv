647544,Drock6687,2011-12-12 04:12:00,90,Just found out that i have tomorrow off and why not fish!  was considering caldonia but the grand is still a little high and dirty so Ill drive the 2 hours to either bayfeild or maitland...any suggestions on what one to go do?
647548,Canuck2fan,2011-12-12 04:25:00,1444, Either are fishable.... Hit Bayfield on Saturday didn't see anything caught muchless have a hit. Heard really good things about the maity though but then fishermen like to tell tales.
