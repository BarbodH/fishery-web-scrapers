647532,g_clot,2011-12-12 03:17:00,104,"So I moved to Blenheim back in September and noticed that the town store didn't carry Senko's, yet they're available online.  I spoke to the owner about them and a few weeks later I see them on the shelves.  IMO, that's progressive action.  Now I don't need to drive for 45 minutes to load back up.  I'm not sure if anyone here has a similar issue, but now I can one-stop-shop, so speak to the store owner or manager and maybe you'll save yourself some gas  "
647537,dave1965,2011-12-12 03:53:00,41, I love my Senkos but they're so darned expensive. So I wait until the Spring Special at Bass Pro to load up. Anyone know a cheaper way to get them?
647543,ld17,2011-12-12 04:08:00,319,ya buy knock offs
647555,Dabluz,2011-12-12 07:35:00,701,"I don't have that kind of cooperation here in my city with it's 3 Canadian Tire outlets.  First of all, nobody who works there goes fishing.  They sell the same stuff that I can find in any Walmart store or any little hardware store that sells fishing equipment.  They are real strong on Toronto Wobblers and cheap snelled hooks."
647565,scugpg,2011-12-12 11:11:00,1373,Some folks sell them here for great prices. I like the yamamoto ones best but they are not cheap
647590,johnnyb,2011-12-12 13:59:00,3413,"I like trying a few different brands each year....a good way to find better value, IMO."
647595,Harrison,2011-12-12 14:22:00,2202," Absolutely.  I tried a handfull of the knock offs, but when it comes down to it I go back to the original.  Probably all in my head but it is where the confidence is.  Die hard senko and grub fisherfolks love their Yamamotos."
647696,10point,2011-12-12 19:39:00,165,I have good success with Bass Pro Stick-O's They hold up better also.
647697,jedimaster,2011-12-12 19:41:00,3472,Sail has them for 7.99 and no tax
647705,motion,2011-12-12 20:05:00,403, I was going to mention Sail as well as Jose (OFC member) has them every year for $5.00/bag. He has a good selection but they sell quickly. Keep an eye out for them in the classified section.
647786,Harrison,2011-12-12 23:52:00,2202,I have the 5 inch for $6.99 and can accommodate large special orders.  Some other senko styles baits to have a looksee at are the Yum Dingers and Ouzo Ouzees.
647916,bottombouncer,2011-12-13 12:00:00,21,i used to have issues with finding specific colour patterns in actual senkos that i wanted in my local stores.i was forced to try different brand names and found that the only down side was the action in each varies but they still produce fish..and some even out produce senkos on waters i fish..
647993,jedimaster,2011-12-13 16:07:00,3472," Can you get different colors on the 5"" ones other than whats listed at the same price?"
648004,Harrison,2011-12-13 16:37:00,2202," I sure can, do special orders all the time."
648009,snowdown,2011-12-13 16:54:00,24, i use wacky so Senko can be used longer.
648075,nailgun,2011-12-13 21:39:00,1, The best ones I have used for years are from bassmagnet. They ship to your place and you can order them online at http://www.bassmagnetlures.com/. Mike and Mary can also make custom colours also.
648256,steverowbotham,2011-12-14 13:09:00,1800,"Get your colours made in bulk, it's an efficient way of doing it.  Bass Magnet makes a good product and I believe X-Zone may be working on one..."
