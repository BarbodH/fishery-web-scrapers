646743,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-12-09 13:24:00,0,"So, long before my OFC time I used to play in a lot of bands, a few of which we pretty serious.  As I finished college and entered ""the adult world"" most of my music chums moved on and I started playing a lot less rock, and playing a lot of acoustic.  This past week my wife and kids were on vacation so I did what anybody would do... I turned my basement into a home recording studio!  After a few nights of screwing around we got down to business last night and my chum and I laid down a track.  I know it's probably not the style of music most of you listen to, but humour me and let me cling to my youth.  Thanks for checking it out.  We wrote and recorded this over 2 evenings and recorded it with a laptop. Hear Dr. Sal Rockin'"
646745,highdrifter,2011-12-09 13:30:00,2534,I'm rocking at the office...  And I love it!!  That's pretty tight for a basement jam.  Cheers HD
646785,blaque,2011-12-09 15:13:00,2419,i dig it! For some reason it just provoked me into blaring Rise Against into my headphones for the last half hour LOL.
646790,manitoubass2,2011-12-09 15:20:00,11391,"DAMN! Nothing wrong with that at all. It's actually a very catchy tune. Hard to believe it was done over two days, very good work  Kinda reminds me of NOFX, but with better singing, lol"
646808,Gerritt,2011-12-09 15:57:00,6129,"reminds me of Finch/Thursday combined, I would never of thought you to be Screamo  Good job bro. Keep em coming this is MY type of music.  G"
646838,ccmtcanada,2011-12-09 18:05:00,7971,Loved it!!!  I'll be dabbling in some recordings as well shortly!
646887,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-12-09 20:52:00,0, huge rise against fan
646888,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-12-09 20:53:00,0," my youth was spent rocking to nofx, bad religion etc."
646889,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-12-09 20:53:00,0," more of an old punker than screamo, but close enough."
646890,manitoubass2,2011-12-09 20:59:00,11391, Nice! I never would have guessed.
646892,blaque,2011-12-09 21:09:00,2419,"And ill be dabbling in trying to figure out my recording software again shortly LOL. I moved everything to my new laptop and having issues, should have just left everything on my desktop"
646894,ccmtcanada,2011-12-09 21:15:00,7971,Blaque. The only thing I still do on my desktop is music recording and video editing!
646895,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-12-09 21:16:00,0," i had similar issues. i couldn't get cakewalk to run on my new pc so i've gone back to using cool edit pro, a program i used to use in the early 2000's."
646896,ccmtcanada,2011-12-09 21:18:00,7971,"Was wondering what you used. I use Audacity. Any real software and my pc can't handle it. Too many audio lag and synch issues, but I can't justify a new desktop. Lol"
646900,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-12-09 21:28:00,0,"i had 2 instances of lag during this session but not as bad as i used tto get.   i think cool edit pro is a pretty simple stripped down program. what i'm most impressed with is the line 6 device we used for bass, guitar, and vocals.  what a tight little machine with presets that suit all my guitar, bass, and vocal needs...  easy to use, no excess sound... boy if i would have had one of those 10 years ago!"
646910,Joey,2011-12-09 21:48:00,9122,"Hey, that's pretty good"
646926,Jigger,2011-12-09 22:35:00,1237,"Reminded me of a time long ago. Pretty cool man! Gave me the itch to record... Maybe instead of ""what song are you listening to?"" there may be a thread in the future called ""What are you playing?"""
646957,Musky or Specks,2011-12-10 01:01:00,2710,"Two words  ""MORE COWBELL""  Hey, never give up man. Arts are what keeps us burning inside."
646967,Rod Caster,2011-12-10 01:45:00,5784,The leading riff reminds me of Alkaline Trio-Private Eye  I like the harmonies...overall it sounds good!
647082,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-12-10 18:38:00,0, that's because the first chord is the same! good ear buddy! me and my chum came up with no less than 5 songs this one sounds like!   haha!
