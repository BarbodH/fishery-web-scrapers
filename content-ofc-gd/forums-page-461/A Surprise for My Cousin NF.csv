648327,bushart,2011-12-14 16:52:00,2628,So here's the story  My young cousin recently (within a year ) got a job with the phone Co.  Now he's a great young man and helps the old guy out lots with heavy lifting things that are harder for me to do now.  Anyway--he really likes his job at the company and feels he's very lucky  So I painted this for him as a surprise  It's 20 x 24---not titled yet
