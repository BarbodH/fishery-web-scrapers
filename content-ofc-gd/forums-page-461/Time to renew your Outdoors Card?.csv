648257,mike rousseau,2011-12-14 13:18:00,4661,Thank you...  Forgot as usual...
648270,cuzza,2011-12-14 13:58:00,467,Thanks - done!
648271,motion,2011-12-14 14:01:00,403, Thats why I pay for a 3-year card. I cant see myself giving up fishing in the next few years unless I'm six feet under.
648273,mike rousseau,2011-12-14 14:03:00,4661,  Gunna go 3 years this time around...
648285,Billy Bob,2011-12-14 14:23:00,5865,I thought you had to get a 3 year card....at least that's what was offered for non-residents.
648297,mike rousseau,2011-12-14 14:49:00,4661,  All cards are 3 years... Tags are different...  My card expires this year so now I can get a 3 year tag...  I wish we had lifetime licenses like you billy bob...
648299,mercman,2011-12-14 14:56:00,7054,"Good to know, as i am getting my full year card and license for next season.I figure, since i fish in Ontario so often, i may as well help pay the bills over there"
648301,NAW,2011-12-14 15:12:00,4022,Got my three year on line last week.  Hunting and fishing.  I found the new website a little tricky.  The links that you have to click are not organized very well.  It makes you think you're not clicking in the right area.

648303,Grimace,2011-12-14 15:18:00,2020,I renewed mine for another 3 years 2 or 3 weeks ago.  I hope the card comes in before January 1st.  My printer took a crap on me so I couldn't print the temperary.
648305,Big Cliff,2011-12-14 15:21:00,6899,"Well, I don't need a fishing license anymore but I guess I still need the outdoor card if I want to continue hunting! I just checked and my card is good until 2013 so I guess I don't have to worry about it for a while."
648308,Nipfisher,2011-12-14 15:27:00,2449,"  Yep, that is the way I went too. My 3 year card (hunting and fishing) is still good until Dec. 31, 2012."
648310,cuzza,2011-12-14 15:28:00,467," Agreed - not exactly intuitive!  For those who (like me) don't share the same thought process as the MNR site designer, once you put in all your details, you click on the outdors card link ($9 something) and on the next page add it and continue, then do the same with the license you want on it. Then go to Checkout."
648313,Grimace,2011-12-14 15:33:00,2020,"Yeah the checkout is a little wonky.  Once you go forward a bit it starts to make sense, but initially it makes you scratch your head for a second or two."
648324,COUNTRYBOY,2011-12-14 16:15:00,130,PROCESS WAS A BIT STUPID BUT GOOD FOR ANOTHER 3 YR...USED MY GIRLFRIEND'S VISA SO IT WAS PRICED REALLY GOOD
648326,vance,2011-12-14 16:32:00,719,PLEASE REMIND ME NEXT YEAR     VANCE
648329,super dave,2011-12-14 16:56:00,323,"I also bought mine online.  Card and 3 year tag.  You can save the temporary copy of your license as a PDF.  If you have a smart phone, email it to yourself so you always have a copy on your phone until the permanent one comes in the mail.  Better than carrying around a big piece of paper or in case you lose the temp copy."
