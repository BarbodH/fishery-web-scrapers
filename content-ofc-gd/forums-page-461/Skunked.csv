647194,Joey,2011-12-11 01:31:00,9122,"Cool Simon, great video and deer shots.  I imagine they eventually get off the ice (I hope)!"
647199,Leecher,2011-12-11 01:45:00,7832,"Skunk or not, you got out again   which is better than me over here     Ah well soon I'll be able to walk on ice  Too bad you don't have a hunting permit.... that's free venison right there Thanks for sharing Simon!!! Jacques"
647225,CRAPPIE,2011-12-11 02:33:00,213,Is the deer get out from the ice?hope she  went home ok.
647252,coreyhkh,2011-12-11 03:34:00,163,Did the deers leg go through the ice?
647279,dhickey,2011-12-11 05:26:00,1038,OH man . You make me freeking crazy  So not fair!!!
647356,Rizzo,2011-12-11 16:36:00,4754,guess it would be pretty slippery out there for a deer. They are probably happy when the snow falls!
647359,bushart,2011-12-11 16:44:00,2628,Hopefully that deer got off the lake or that pack of wolves that lives around the corner will prove that Darwin was right
647372,limeyangler,2011-12-11 17:28:00,5204,"Thanks for the replies folks. I dont know if the deer made it off...they were just sat there at sunset when i walked off the ice.....it was dark when i left for work this morning so could not see.   LOL....my buddy Carmon still has a Doe tag...he knows they are there after i spoke to him last night.....and there is enough ice out there too drive right up to thaem in his F150    No...there is 10"" to 12"" of ice right there, it is just folded beneath her in that pic.    Not long dood...hang in there!    I will be happy too, snowmobiling with a liquid cooled is not suited to glare ice at all!   I dont think they will have lasted the night either Bushy...way too many cayotes and wolves around."
647374,tb4me,2011-12-11 17:42:00,3295,Quick call a buddy with a tag and a crossbow! Its dinner time!
