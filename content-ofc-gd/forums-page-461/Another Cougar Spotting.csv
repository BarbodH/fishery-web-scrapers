646656,Freshtrax,2011-12-09 02:48:00,2215,Hahahahahahahahahah. Yes you will
646667,Sharkbait22,2011-12-09 03:09:00,297,Pink collars sounds like a pet.  The only reason MNR would introduce cougars is because someone is making them.  I can't see that happening. Imagine the public up-roar?
646673,irishfield,2011-12-09 03:21:00,26272,Rumour has it that the MNR introduced Fisher release program (to control porqupines) is now out of control... and they reintroduced the cougar to cull the Fishers back... as it has few if any other predators.
646675,aplumma,2011-12-09 03:27:00,6896,Back to the topic please. The cougar life ad is automatic we can control google only so far. Lol  Art
646700,danc,2011-12-09 04:10:00,4677,I came almost face to face with one a few decades ago. Something I'll never forget.

646715,manitoubass2,2011-12-09 05:45:00,11391,"  2 years ago me, my girlfriend and our children almost walked into one. It crossed the road (just down from our house) about 50 yards in front of us! Stopped, looked over, kept walking back into the bush.  We turned around, walked quietly for a few yards, then ran like hell! Seriously got the heart going.  Beautiful animal though, that was the third one I've seen personally in NW ontario in the past 5 years. One was from my vehicle though, and the other one was on the road dead, hit by a pulp truck"
646903,ch312,2011-12-09 21:33:00,1590," please don't tell me you're one of those ""there's not a single cougar in ontario"" people.  last year a buddy and i watched one jump in front of us about 20-30ft away while we were on the atv's. he saw the entire body while i just caught the back half and tail as it jumped across the trail. we're both 100% sure of what we saw.  this was in mount pleasant, 10 minutes southwest of brantford.   proof? we searched for over an hour trying to locate some tracks, but even with my tracking skills we couldn't locate a single one."
647012,dhickey,2011-12-10 05:12:00,1038,About 4-5 years ago I read an artical about cougars becoming a problem in Ontario concerning horse farmers and small animals such as goats/sheep and pigs.  The fact that they are here is verry real and they are further south than many people want to admit.  In this artical the MNR estimated there to be about 250 courgars in central and southern ontario. 4-5 years ago.  I know for a fact that they do thrive in Mono Township which is only 1/2 an hour north from Brampton and they do also exist in Mulmer within the rual comunitys.  To put this in perspective theese are large cats with amasing stealth/strength and cunning. Able to easily take down a small deer and known to go after horses.  Are they a threat to our everyday lives? NO (farmers?? maby)  I am far more concerned with the local yote-(rat faced varmet not worthy of recognition)poppulation.  I believe the only reason they are making a come back is because of a healthy deer /turky and yote poppulation.

The MNR has spent several days investigating the authenticity of a photograph Jim Turncliffe said he took of a cougar on his property Nov. 26.  Jolanta Kowalski, a senior ministry spokeswoman in Toronto, said the photograph is of a cougar, but it wasn't taken where Turncliffe said it was taken.  The photo shows a side profile of a cougar inside a chain-link pen.  ""The cougar was not in that individual kennel,"" Kowalski said Tuesday afternoon.  Turncliffe stated in a previous interview he has seen large cat tracks on his property for the past two or three years. After a little more investigating, Turncliffe said he believed the tracks belonged to a cougar.  Turncliffe said he noticed a large animal in his dog pen on Nov. 26. After realizing it wasn't his dog, he grabbed a camera and headed outside.  Turncliffe said he was standing less than 20 feet from the pen.  Kowalski said a team of MNR investigators, along with experts from Ontario, the United States and the Ontario Puma Foundation examined the image.  She said ministry investigators also went to the Widdifield Station Road property and took photos.  ""There were many inconsistencies between the two photos,"" Kowalski said. ""The type of fence posts were different, the size of enclosure, landmarks and snow conditions were inconsistent for Nov. 26.""  Kowalski said cameras put up around Turncliffe's property have since been taken down.  Calls to Turncliffe for comment Tuesday afternoon were unsuccessful.  Kowalski said the ministry knows there are cougars in Ontario, but sightings are very rare.  ""If someone has a photograph or other evidence contact us. The public doesn't have to be afraid of a cougar on the loose.""  There have been several reports of cougar sightings in the area including MacPherson Drive toward Centennial Crescent and Bonfield. In the fall of 2008, numerous reports were made by residents near Birchs Road and Marshall Avenue in West Ferris. There were also reports made in 2007.  [emailÂ protected]"
648178,Djeep,2011-12-14 01:47:00,199,"I'm really on the fence on this issue and have spoken to many past mnr employees as well as people who claim to have encountered cougars, does anyone have a real picture or any definitive evidence?"
648242,Whitespinnerbait,2011-12-14 12:06:00,2038,  NO!  That would be like having the winning 6/49 ticket in your back pocket
648466,bucktail,2011-12-15 01:01:00,1857,"There must have been a cougar crapping on the ice of the ACC during a Leafs game on saturday evening  for the MNR to finally admit they are around.  Have a friend that saw one in the crown land near Minden abut 6 years ago, watched it watching him for 10 minutes."
646503,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-12-08 19:14:00,0,"http://www.nugget.ca/ArticleDisplay.aspx?e=3396969  (see link for photo)  Rumours of cougar sightings have run rampant in North Bay area for years.  And the handy camera work of Jim Turncliffe has put the large cat in the spotlight again.  Turncliffe, who has lived on Widdifield Station Road for almost 40 years, said he has been seeing large cat tracks on his property for two or three years. The longtime trapper dug up a field book and confirmed the tracks belonged to a cougar.  On Nov. 26, Turncliffe woke at dawn and saw a large animal in is dog pen. Realizing, he hadn't put his shepherd-husky mix in the pen the previous evening, he grabbed a camera and headed outside in his sock feet.  ""I came around from beside my shed and took a photo,"" he said, adding he was standing less than 20 feet from the pen. ""It saw me and shot out like a cannon and was in the bush in seconds.""  He thinks the cat may have been after deer scraps he left in the pen for his dog.  Turncliffe and his friend, Alain Denis, a resident of Lennox Road about three miles as the crow flies from the Widdifield Station property, are both avid hunters.  ""This is a cougar, no two ways about it,"" Denis said looking at the picture.  The Ministry of Natural Resources has yet to confirm the sighting.  ""We can't say for sure that is a cougar,"" said Jolanta Kowalski, a senior spokeswoman with the MNR in Toronto. ""We do get a fair number of photos of cougars sent to us, but 99% of the time they turn out to be hoaxes.""  The ministry sent two officers to Turncliffe's property Wednesday and one confirmed the cat in the photograph was indeed a cougar.  ""We have someone on the ground doing an investigation,"" Kowalski said.  The officers set up a trail camera that is activated by movement.  ""We will try and catch photos of the cougar again,"" Kowalski said.  Reports of cougar sightings have not been uncommon in the area.  A couple reported seeing a cougar on MacPherson Drive toward Centennial Crescent last winter. And a Bonfield woman said she saw a cougar behind her home around the same time.  There were several reports of cougar sightings in the North Bay area in the fall of 2008, including numerous near Birchs Road and Marshall Avenue in West Ferris. Police upped patrols in the area.  Some schools kept students indoors during recess and West Ferris Secondary School asked its students to avoid door-to-door canvassing for the food bank.  There were also sightings reported in 2007.  The ministry has never verified the animal because it has not received evidence of photographs, scat or tracks in the area.  Kowalski said there are free ranging cougars in Ontario but they are rare and it's not clear where they come from.  ""The most likely origins are releases, escapes, migrants from other jurisdictions or possibly remnants of the original Ontario population,"" she said.  The cougar is listed as an endangered species under Ontario's Endangered Species Act, 2007. The act prohibits the killing, capture, possession, buying, selling or trading of a cougar.  ""However you can kill a cougar, or any other species at risk if, and only if, you are acting to protect yourself, another human or an animal if you think there is an imminent threat to the health and safety of the human or animal,"" Kowalski said.  She suggests residents of the area be aware of their surroundings when out and about, stay out of wooded areas between dusk and dawn, travel with others, make noise and carry a whistle.  ""All animals are unpredictable, and the public should always exercise caution and never approach one,"" she said.  Turncliffe said his dog, Shiloh, usually roams the property but hasn't left the perimeter of the house since the sighting.  For now the deer scraps will be put in front of the motion camera, and Turncliffe will keep a close eye on his property.  ""If it goes near one of my dogs, I will shoot it.""  âââ  About cougars  âââ  Since 2002, 1,000 cougar sightings in the province have been reported to the ministry and the Ontario Puma Foundation.  A handful of sightings have been confirmed by photos, track marks or DNA taken from scat (droppings).  Ontario cougars maybe brownish-grey, reddish-brown or light beige.  Male cougars can weigh up to 200 pounds and measure up to six-and-a-half feet from nose to the tip of the tail.  Cougar tracks have four toes. The tracks measure about three inches long by 3.5 inches wide.  Source: Ministry of Natural Resources"

646525,mercman,2011-12-08 21:25:00,7054, So much can be said about a thread title like that x2 on the read.Interesting article.
646526,GreenCanada,2011-12-08 21:25:00,375," I agree to some extent with your comment. I wouldn't necessarily trade, but I definitely believe that these cougars should not be shot. They have a right to live and just because someone may not follow the suggestions to increase their safety does not mean that they should be able to kill it. Ie. if someone lets their dog out to go to the bathroom at 1am and does not keep an eye on them and a cougar attacks the dog, then unfortunately the owner is to blame. The cougar should not be killed.  We as responsible individuals should heed the warnings and take the necessary action to ensure the safety of our family.  Great article, thanks for sharing!"
646528,tb4me,2011-12-08 21:29:00,3295,"The fact that they are in the woods is wonderfull to me. I like the idea that they are there. If they get heavily populated then we will have to change the meaning of the term ""cougar hunting"""
