647385,Dabluz,2011-12-11 18:20:00,701,"  I had exactly the same results using 15 lb and then 25 lb test Seaguar leader material.  I normally use very light lines so my knots are always very carefully tied.  No matter what I did, the 15 lb test Seaguar was weaker than my 10 lb test ""el cheapo"" which cost 7 dollars for 1500 yards.  So then I decided to use 25 lb test Seaguar.  It was not much stronger than the 15 lb test.  If I used the fluorocarbon just for making a harness, the harness would break before the 10 lb test el cheapo line.  I got the best results just using the ""el cheapo"" mono for everything.  I even hauled up some of my lost lures and hooks that had hooked into the sunken wood on the bottom with my ""el cheapo"" mono.  My first experience with fluorocarbon was with Berkley Vanish in 6 lb test.  I couldn't find any 4 lb test Vanish.  I spooled a brook trout reel with the stuff.  I took me about 10 minutes to really hate the stuff.  I was fishing from shore.  I fish with just a size 8 Gamakatsu Octopus hook and the head of a nightcrawler.  I need to use light line if I want decent distance when casting.  Anyway, the stuff was way weaker than my 4 lb mono, It also had very weak shock strength.  It sank (something I didn't know at the time) so I couldn't let my bait rest on the bottom at all.  The sinking also increased hanging up on bottom by a tenfold.  The only thing that I will admit is an advantage with fluorocarbon is the fact that it could be more abrasion resistant.  However, in my 60 years of fishing, abrasion has been the least of my problems.  I have never had abrasion problems when fly fishing.  Actually, using mono when nymph fishing with sinking line or sinking tip line is an advantage because the fly line can drag along the bottom while the nymph is moving along above the bottom.  I've been fishing with jigs since the late 50's and early 60's....before they became popular in Canada.  I've almost never had my line suffer from abrasion.  I am a cheap guy and I hate to lose lures or hooks.  Yet, I am a proud person and I like to catch my share of the fish or better.  I am one of the 10 percenters.  I still say the fluorocarbon is junk.....lol.  I cannot fathom how anyone can find something good about it after all the independant tests that have been done."
647594,Garnet,2011-12-12 14:05:00,2056,"By using heavy flouro and short less then 2 ft leader you can keep the nose of your popper digging into the surface.  You can get a little more depth with jerkbaits using long flouro leaders.  With flouro stiffness you get less hook rap.  If you use heavy braid with it's floating characteristics and a flouro leader you create a half moon like line trail with your swimbait well below your braid. That day I was using 80lb braid and 20 flouro leader, it worked for largemouth ""once""."

645143,Garnet,2011-12-03 19:01:00,2056,"Guess I was the only guy awake in chemistry class!  Mono is a 2 molecule product that means it floats and very porest. Will adsorb water and sink in time, also very stretchy.  Co polymer is a 3 molecule product so less porest less stretch and sinks easy.  Fluorocarbon is a 4 molecule product,harder, shiner finish, therefore less stretch, less likely to nick and stiff, more pron to coil, harder to mange in cold weather.  All the specter braids float.  If you try to use any these products and don't consider there built in characteristics you will have poor results."

As far as shiney flurocarbon that is true but the shiney aspect is most pronounced with nicks and kinks and it is for this reason there are coloured flurocarbon lines. The thinking is that with some colouration the nicks and kinks that show up in clear fluro as bright anomalies will be disguised by the colouration. I am not a scientist so I can't say if this is in fact the truth or more marketing hype. That said it has some logic to it...if you buy the whole Flurocarbon advantage to begin with."
645339,Garnet,2011-12-04 17:34:00,2056,"For all lines mono,co polymer, and flouro color just adds to the dia.  The flouro theory is it's clarity is just a couple hundreds off water color. If that theory was correct 4lb and 30lb should be just as effective down at the river.  Also with all the water colors available in nature it's probably  junk science.  Flouro still has a big place in my fishing season."

645401,Dabluz,2011-12-04 22:54:00,701," In those conditions, I use 4 lb clear mono, maybe 6 lb clear mono if the lake trout average over 6 lbs.  A good reel and good rod handling techniques prevent line breakage."

645421,Familyfisherman,2011-12-05 00:35:00,188,"I saw that testing some time ago and was glad to read it.  The way I'm interpreting those results, it seems that some of the flouros do a better job of keeping up with the claims -- BPS in my opinion seems to be amongst the leaders, and is often cheaper to buy, so that's the one I favour...even though I don't like BPS products, pricing, etc in general.  One thing that really effects performance is age -- flouro doesn't last nearly as long as braid.  I'd suggest 2 things to increase your success with it:  1. Test knots before use, and wet the line when tying knots, and 2. Buy smaller spools of flouro and only use them for one season.  Performance will be optimal, and you'll spend a bit less on smaller spools, and have less to throw out at the end of the season.  That said, as a leader material I've had no real issues to speak of, although always test knots to save frustration when landing fish."

So invent something new and mark-up the price.  Claim that it's invisible and watch the hens come to roost.Don't be duped.

644482,Dabluz,2011-12-01 06:00:00,701,  Read the stretch test in the second link I sent.  Fluorocarbon stretches just as much as Berkley XL.  Berkley XL is about the most elastic line you can find.  The 10 or 12 lb fluorocarbon was subjected to a stess of 3 lbs during the stretch test (1/3 it's strength).  This is very little stress in my book.  All the fluorocarbon lines were difformed and therefore weakened after such a light test and meanwhile the mono did not show any signs of stress after the tests.
644483,Dabluz,2011-12-01 06:06:00,701,  Yeah....good idea....check out the sight that sells the stuff.  They will be the first to tell us that the stuff is not good....lol.
644485,Dabluz,2011-12-01 06:17:00,701,"I only wanted to give a slight warning to fishermen about fluorocarbon line.  I saw long ago that the stuff is crap.  I've since then tried out other fluorocarbon lines and was very disappointed.  Ok....All of my fishing is done with line from 2 to 6 lb test (most of the time with 4 lb mono) except for when I use braided line for long lining or for pike or deep saltwater fish.  I have been fishing with very light lines for over 40 years.  I make my own fly fishing leaders up to 18 feet long and 3/4 lb test.  Yes.....350 grams.  No....I don't want my line to fall to the bottom.  I only want my bait to fall to the bottom and I want that when I pull on my line, the bait hops off the bottom and not drag on the bottom. If you want more abrasion resistance, use some good old fashioned Stren Original.  It won the contest in the abrasion resistance test about 10 years ago.  Or buy Berkley XT or other ""tough line"" that is harder and less elastic than Berkley XL or all the fluorocarbon lines.  I don't care if someone wants to use fluorocarbon line.  I just wanted to warn against all the lies that the companies who sell the stuff say about it."
644490,Billy Bob,2011-12-01 11:00:00,5865,I only use fluorocarbon as a leader on my Dispy Divers and my home made worm harness I use on Lake Erie.  I use to use 12# mono for my worm harnesses but they kept getting chewed up while dragging on the bottom of Erie filled with Zebra Mussels...so I started to tie the harnesses with 20# fluorocarbon and the results have been very good.....it takes the harsh environment of the rough lake floor without giving up bites.

That says somthing, tests from years ago notwithstanding. Charlie Wray from Fishfull Thinking TV is a spokesperson for Seagar and his claim is that when attaching fluro to ""O"" rings (which attaches most cranks to the line) you should  tie with a single uni knot vs palomar,clinch, Triline etc knots. It's an extremely easy knot to tie and it works very well resulting in a small slippage free knot. I use it to tie on cranks with ""O"" ring but also on snaps, snap swivels etc. I use a double uni to attach fluro leader to mainline braid which is also a small easy knot.

644760,Roy,2011-12-02 02:14:00,13728,"OK, for all the folks reading this and who are relatively new to fishing, please do not use fluorocarbon as a mainline on your reels. Regardless of what you may have read, seen or heard of, fluorocarbon is one of those marketing jokes gone awry. You can and may however use a short length of the stuff ..say 12"" to 48"" as a leader between your mainline (monofilament or braid) and your live or artificial bait. The small calibers of fluorocarbon such as 4lbs or so are mainly used by people who think that a fish has the intelligence to become alarmed at having a piece of dental floss attached to their dinner of plastic with treble hooks. The large calibers such as 100lbs or so are mainly used by muskie fishermen who are concerned about the damage that a steel leader can cause to a fish rolling on a leader during combat.  There are literally hundreds of brands of monofilament lines and braided lines. For monos, go with a standard brand such as Stren or Trilene. For the braids again, go with the standards although most are almost the same. Don't be fooled by all the colourful boxes on the shelves...some manufacturers will go to great lengths to make you buy their inferior product. If you see packaging with beautiful holographic images that looks like it's worth more than the line, it probably is. Use common sense."

644445,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-12-01 01:56:00,0,i like fluoro leaders.  never real got the advantage of using a full fluoro mainline when a 2 foot leader would likely do the same in 99% of situations.
644446,SGP,2011-12-01 01:57:00,23,"One big advantage that fluoro has over mono & braid is that it sinks.  This can be very important for certain presentations.  Suggestion: Take a look at some of the fluorocarbon coated lines.  They offer some of the benefits (of fluoro) without the knot and handling issues.  Having said all that, I still use Trilene XT and Big Game mono on a regular basis.  I change my line often and Fluoro can become very costly.  "
644447,Live2fish85,2011-12-01 01:58:00,1633,I have had no problem with flouro and I use it alot. I won't use anything but flouro for leaders from bass to muskie  I haven't had any trouble.
644448,ChrisK,2011-12-01 02:10:00,2772,I only use fluorocarbon when pinning. I've also been trying different brands over the years. I like the Frog hair and the Drennan. It seem to be more abrasion resistant and stronger knot strength than most of the others.
644449,Dan668,2011-12-01 02:14:00,1120,Always fluoro  Leader for me. Never had a problem. Cranks full fluoro no problem
644450,BillM,2011-12-01 02:21:00,17367,"Flouro for mainline is garbage if you ask me, for leader no issues."
644451,kickingfrog,2011-12-01 02:26:00,8333,"Fluoro is just a tool.  Doesn't matter how good a wrench you have, if you use it as a hammer."
644454,Fishnwire,2011-12-01 02:35:00,983,"I only use it for leaders, so the price is not a big deal.  A spool or two lasts a season...relative to the rest of the money I spend on tackle and equipment, it's not that big a hit.  I use Fireline on all my spinning reels as main line, but used mono for years and find fluoro is a little tougher.  I just have a little more confidence with it so the extra $20 or so a year is fine with me.  I did buy fluoro once that was junk...I forget the name but I recognize it when I see it and haven't bought it since.  That said, I've bought terrible mono too."
644458,mercman,2011-12-01 02:54:00,7054,"  When you talk about knot strength, are you refering to slippage or the actual knot breaking. I have been using saliva when tightening knots in flouro, and so far(touch wood) no slippage or breaking. I started,late this season, to but a drop of anglers glue on the knot.I read somewhere it helps."
644460,Dave Jones,2011-12-01 02:58:00,50,"No need for it most of the time, unless the water is gin clear. If there is any stain to the water I go to my old stand by maxima ultra green 6lb."
644462,msp,2011-12-01 03:00:00,1336,"Thats a great quote ! Can I use it sometime ? I use flouro lots of time but not all the time. Mostly just leaders for bass (12#), trout(4-6#) and pike (50#) Thousands of pro fisherman that fish for millions of dollars all use flourocarbon line. I doubt that its just because they are sponsored"
