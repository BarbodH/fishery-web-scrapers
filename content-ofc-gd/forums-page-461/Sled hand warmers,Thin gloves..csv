647398,Tybo,2011-12-11 19:15:00,1373,It's got to be very cold or raining for me to wear a heavy glove. Eg; 100g of thinsulate or higher.  So what I need is a glove on low setting that will not make my hands sweat. I have tried alot of different types.But all $50's or less. I would like too find a pair to solve this problem at no expense.
647405,misfish,2011-12-11 19:41:00,29133,"Paul  Are you looking for a winter thin glove,or just something to protect your hands from the elements while sleding?  How about those machanic gloves?"
647406,Leecher,2011-12-11 19:45:00,7832,"I find that the thickest gloves I wear, the colder my hands becomes because I sweat... The only gloves that I feel comfortable and warm (and as sealy as it may sound) is a pair of cross country gloves like the ones shown below:  Cross Country Gloves  Affordable, not bulky and warm for the cold winter days out there Leechman"
647408,misfish,2011-12-11 19:48:00,29133,"I should of added,I use those doctor thin latex gloves(no powder) under my main gloves.They seem to keep the heat in the hands,until you rip one,but I just throw another on and good to go."
647411,Sinker,2011-12-11 19:58:00,8692,"Wool.....works every time.  I have thin wool gloves, and even on the coldest days, that's all I wear. If anything.......  S."
647416,Tybo,2011-12-11 20:08:00,1373," Just a glove for sleding. Have try three different types of mech gloves.Leather,synthetic and impact type. They all get to hot on the warmer,making my hands sweat."
647418,Sinker,2011-12-11 20:10:00,8692,Have you tried not using the handwarmers lol  Just sayin........  S.
647425,Tybo,2011-12-11 20:28:00,1373,"Hand warmers paks are to hot also.  My hands can sweat in the nitrile gloves at -20.Wear them at work.  It's like I have too have more insulation in the palm to stop the heat from the warmer. With the back side being able to breath. I have try gore-tex  in this mater,But the palms of my hand still get to hot."
647430,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-12-11 20:38:00,0,"underarmour sells something they call a mitt liner.  they fit tight like spandex and wick moisture from your hands.  i don't know what's going to stop your hand from sweating though.  if your hand warmer is anything like mine, it pretty much burns the fingers once it's fully warmed."
647489,simonl,2011-12-12 00:20:00,28,Last yr I picked up a pair of Ice Armour shooting gloves. I wear them on the sled with the warmers on and find it perfect. Lots of dexterity and they seem to have a little more wind resistance than the mecanix gloves so the backs of my hands don't get as cold when travelling on the sled. The bad....not at all waterproof or water repellant. If breaking trail or moving snow loaded branches out of the way hands are wet through in no time and then I am back to square one. They are good otherwise.
647495,DRIFTER_016,2011-12-12 00:38:00,10439,"  Mine too, but I just turn it down. Luckily my hand warmers are digitally controlled and have 10 settings."
647567,Billy Bob,2011-12-12 11:17:00,5865," Well at ""no expense"" the only thing I can think of is a old pair of wool socks that you might have laying around..."
647568,cranks bait,2011-12-12 11:27:00,721,Check out Saucony's run glove or flip mitt?  Very thin and the mitt goes over the top of your hand but the palm is still the thin glove?
647589,Ron,2011-12-12 13:54:00,1683,You don't need gloves at all with these unless it is really really cold. Your hands won't sweat in them either.  
647618,Billy Bob,2011-12-12 15:07:00,5865," OK Ron, you got me....what the hell is that ???"
647647,ch312,2011-12-12 17:08:00,1590," LOL...you put them on your handlebars and then slide your hands into these. excellent for keeping the wind off your hands while keeping them dry at the same time.   you guys are concerned about keeping your hands from sweating while im concerned about trying to keep my hands warm. i have a bad problem with circulation in my hands, so the rest of my body can literally be sweating while my hands are ice cold with a few white fingers. i have to do the ""windmill"" to force blood back into my hands and fingers. having to wear gloves when it's 5 degrees out sucks big time..."
647648,NAW,2011-12-12 17:09:00,4022,"Looks like it mounts to the handle bars on a sled..  I wonder how well they would work on a sled that doesn't have hand warmers.  Say,,Like a 250 bravo."
647649,ch312,2011-12-12 17:10:00,1590, most people that have these mounted on their sleds and atv's don't use their hand warmers very often as these covers stop your biggest enemy....wind.
647678,ecmilley,2011-12-12 18:56:00,2163,"gauntlets are great for keeping your hands warm, you cam almost turn the heaters off completly, most guys running these can run mechanic gloves or something thats equally thin, maybe you can find a wicking liner out of some combi or ckx branded gloves"
647689,mercman,2011-12-12 19:21:00,7054,I found the perfect hat to accompany those gauntlets. http://www.kaboodle.com/reviews/beardhead-mens-grandpa-cold-weather-hat  Ideal for keeping icicles of the stash  
647880,carll2,2011-12-13 03:57:00,443," i ride offtrail snowmobiles and we tend to get sweat alot especially up in the mountains(rockys) so i use klim gloves, been using them for 5 years and they are awesome..all goretex and leather, keeps your hands nice and dry and non sweaty. now i have a few different pairs but the best thinnest ones that keep me warm so far are the powercross glove! heres a link   http://klimcanada.com/store/index.html#id=snow-bootsgloves&num=10   P:S all i ride with is klim goretex gear and im always dry and happy even though it costs an arm and leg lolll"

648082,Tybo,2011-12-13 21:50:00,1373,"Bought a klim parka last year.It's a great piece of equipment. Did try their glove,but couldn't talk myself into the price. I need to solve this problem.So I'll try the klim.  Thank you every one for the help.   Paul."
648105,Gerritt,2011-12-13 22:45:00,6129,Let Joey do the driving...   and keep your hands in your pockets... or around a bottle of Molson  G
648149,carll2,2011-12-14 00:57:00,443,"   im sure it will do the job, i too have overly sweaty  hands and the klim powercross glove solved my problem and the fusion glove for them colder days or trail rides"
