The MNR has spent several days investigating the authenticity of a photograph Jim Turncliffe said he took of a cougar on his property Nov. 26.  Jolanta Kowalski, a senior ministry spokeswoman in Toronto, said the photograph is of a cougar, but it wasn't taken where Turncliffe said it was taken.  The photo shows a side profile of a cougar inside a chain-link pen.  ""The cougar was not in that individual kennel,"" Kowalski said Tuesday afternoon.  Turncliffe stated in a previous interview he has seen large cat tracks on his property for the past two or three years. After a little more investigating, Turncliffe said he believed the tracks belonged to a cougar.  Turncliffe said he noticed a large animal in his dog pen on Nov. 26. After realizing it wasn't his dog, he grabbed a camera and headed outside.  Turncliffe said he was standing less than 20 feet from the pen.  Kowalski said a team of MNR investigators, along with experts from Ontario, the United States and the Ontario Puma Foundation examined the image.  She said ministry investigators also went to the Widdifield Station Road property and took photos.  ""There were many inconsistencies between the two photos,"" Kowalski said. ""The type of fence posts were different, the size of enclosure, landmarks and snow conditions were inconsistent for Nov. 26.""  Kowalski said cameras put up around Turncliffe's property have since been taken down.  Calls to Turncliffe for comment Tuesday afternoon were unsuccessful.  Kowalski said the ministry knows there are cougars in Ontario, but sightings are very rare.  ""If someone has a photograph or other evidence contact us. The public doesn't have to be afraid of a cougar on the loose.""  There have been several reports of cougar sightings in the area including MacPherson Drive toward Centennial Crescent and Bonfield. In the fall of 2008, numerous reports were made by residents near Birchs Road and Marshall Avenue in West Ferris. There were also reports made in 2007.  [emailÂ protected]"

648304,adolson,2011-12-14 15:18:00,783," Benefit of the doubt: maybe he really is concerned and has been seeing them, but could never get a pic so he figured if he faked one, he'd be taken seriously.  My dad and uncles and now-late grandmother have seen cougars on their farm property up this way, but that was about 15 or so years ago."
