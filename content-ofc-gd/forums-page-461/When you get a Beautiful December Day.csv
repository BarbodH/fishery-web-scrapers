So on with the day. Knowing that the only accessible softwater for me was in the rivers, it was time to make my first trek all year to try for the fish that I never catch. He even sets my float up and lets me make a few drifts at one of his holes and nothing...But once he sets up and makes his first drift, FISH ON. Excuse the picture, there's more to hide than just the location.    The day went on, and buddy lands another 1, and I finish my day with 2 chub..The best in terms of numbers I've ever had at a river! No complaints from me, as I enjoyed a beautiful day out being in only a sweater!  And I probably need some practice at steelheading."
