648080,Twocoda,2011-12-13 21:46:00,4130, because the drain is plugged with stelco slag  now that it was on tv and the internet it is true....one always has to confirm the other

647581,I'mHooked,2011-12-12 13:27:00,525,I saw my lure!
647582,Garnet,2011-12-12 13:34:00,2056,I watched last night and this morning (pvr). Will there be more in a series or just this show.
647585,Fish Farmer,2011-12-12 13:39:00,2234,"Anyone want to buy a boat,   no fish left. The sky is falling. I won't be here to see it. Interesting show though."
647652,Headhunter,2011-12-12 17:17:00,5703,"I watched it and enjoyed the show... but I did not see the Avro Arrow, sitting on the bottom of Lake O!  Saw a ton of Gobbies though! HH"

647936,Joey,2011-12-13 13:33:00,9122,"I found it interesting, but don't think they could fit all they wanted into the 1 hour show.  Lots of shipwrecks they could have shown and they should have spent more time on each lake IMO."
647950,JTorra,2011-12-13 14:03:00,50,I'm sending my Humminbird 798si back to see if they can upgrade it to the imaging quality on the Hydrographic Survey boats!
647951,Roy,2011-12-13 14:06:00,13728, They're using Lowrance units.
