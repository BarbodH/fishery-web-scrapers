647068,DRIFTER_016,2011-12-10 17:38:00,10439," There are 2 styles of blades in wide use in power augers 1/ Cutting blades like the ones on hand augers and 2/ Ripper blades.  Strikemaster and Jiffy use both types depending on auger model. Mine uses the ripper blades which stay sharp longer than the cutting type blades. Until you hit a rock that is. Only done that once.  The cutting blades cut through the ice faster but need sharpening more often.  Ripper blades are much better when you are drilling dirty ice or redrilling old holes. Out West (Alberta, BC, Yukon, Alaska) there is a lot of dirty ice (due to glacial sediment) and this dulls cutting type blades very quickly.  Ripper blades reopen old holes with ease while cutting type blades tend to bind when breaking through."
647107,misfish,2011-12-10 21:55:00,29133,"I have the ripper on mine.I have been told they can be sharpen with a chainsaw file.   And like I have said way too many times.you guys that drill a half hole to sit yer augar in,thats a big NO NO"
647112,irishfield,2011-12-10 22:02:00,26272," Yep.. flat file across the face and a small needle file on the ""teeth""."
647118,DRIFTER_016,2011-12-10 22:35:00,10439,I use the same procedure on my auger blades as I do on my chisels.
647212,rdambros,2011-12-11 02:12:00,71,"I was in Costco yesterday in Richmond Hill and they had a dozen of them in stock. I bought an Eskimo last year and used it only one day, it worked like butter."
647342,skeeter,2011-12-11 15:41:00,1907,Costco was selling them for $339.99 They have dropped the price to $ 289.97 now. I'm on my way back to costco to get my $56.50 price difference back.
647346,GBW,2011-12-11 16:05:00,8460,"wayne, you are correct, correct and correct.  the user has either A. stood on the auger to ""help it cut"". B. let a friend use it who has no clue and might have hit something.  or A + B = C.  C. is just a tool  But I have a 2nd set of blades as backup just in case.  I too notice the blades make a huge diff. either ripper or cut like a manual."
647464,skeeter,2011-12-11 23:08:00,1907,"Correction on price. Online it says $289.97 When I went there today to get the difference back, they are on for $249.99..  That was $101 cash back, then we spent another $385.oo there."
636426,Cosmos,2011-11-01 02:01:00,588,"Hi Guys,  Just got news email from Costco.

I bought equinox ice hut from Costco and i am pretty happy with it. Just wondering how good is this product?"
636429,Cosmos,2011-11-01 02:05:00,588,Also i can see that they start selling ice huts again:  http://www.costco.ca/Browse/ProductSet.aspx?Prodid=10352729&whse=BCCA&Ne=4000000&eCat=BCCA|111|22211|22229&N=4011457&Mo=10&No=10&Nr=P_CatalogName:BCCA&cat=22229&Ns=P_Price|1||P_SignDesc1&lang=en-CA&Sp=C&hierPath=111*22211*22229*&topnav=  I used 2-3 person all last season and wuld like to say that this is a really good product for this money.
636443,Stef,2011-11-01 03:02:00,63,"Viper was the engine name for eskimo augers, engine size is same as the mid-line Mako unit so thats probably what it is, maybe a different drill head.  Costco ued to sell the eskimo line...."
636494,alexmedic,2011-11-01 11:48:00,186,"I am not familiar with the quality of the unit, but Costco is great for returns if you are not happy..."
636501,Jer,2011-11-01 12:06:00,1426,"Looks to be the same as the Eskimo unit they carried the last couple of years, except green paint must cost more than red...  They did the same with the pop-up huts the stores have carried (on-line is sometimes different). Two years ago they sold the red Eskimo QuickFish 3, last year they had a blue version under a different name but it was identical in every other way.  The suppliers prefer to sell Costco a slightly differentiated product (if only in colour) in order to protect the price integrity of other dealers of the same product."
636518,motion,2011-11-01 12:54:00,403,"If only they had a 10"" version   I'm crossing my fingers that either Costco or another store will offer a good price on a 10"" auger. As for the 8"" auger, $329.00 to your door is a great price. I also agree that Costco is great for returns if your not happy."
636532,Jds63,2011-11-01 13:21:00,1365,"I just saw that on their site as well, it says it has a Viper engine, but if its the same as their Eskimo then thats good as some folks here said the Eskimo has worked well, + Costco's return policy is very good. Now to see how many twoonies I have saved in my change jar, that just may cover it half of it ...."
636535,Harrison,2011-11-01 13:28:00,2202,Looks the exact same as the Eskimo that I will stock except the colour.  Tough to lose that sucker on the ice!
636538,GBW,2011-11-01 13:36:00,8460,after playing with google search for Tempest Ice Auger all I cam up with was the Cost-Co site.  It looks just like the Eskimo I got last year but in bright green.  When I got mine it was $299.99 online shipping incl. or $284.99 in store.  so call your local store to see if tey are going to stock it based on the web item number.  they can tell you what stores are going to or are selling it too.  I'm very happy with mine.
646941,adempsey,2011-12-09 23:56:00,1498,"Just an update.  Costco currently has the Tempest ice auger on sale for $289.97, including shipping.  More than what CTC had it on for, but the shipping is free at least."
646942,aplumma,2011-12-10 00:04:00,6896,A question I am not sure of the answer of is  can you return the used ice auger to a local store or is shipping used gas motors allowed up North?  Art
646972,Dutch,2011-12-10 02:18:00,831,"Just a heads up - Peterborough Costco is clearing these out at $249.97.  Had 7-8 units in stock.  I'm assuming this is a great price.  Brand may be unproven, but with Costco's return policy is probably a no-brainer for those looking for an auger."
646976,DRIFTER_016,2011-12-10 02:34:00,10439," Brand is not unproven, they are rebranded Eskimo Makos the same as the Rapala power augers CTC had on sale last week for $249."
646987,GBW,2011-12-10 03:31:00,8460,correct!  just make sure you can get the right replacement blades (or know how to sharpen them on your own) if you do so...
646989,misfish,2011-12-10 03:37:00,29133, Dont waste yer time on the sharpening.get replacement blades.   Should of bought a strike master. PROVEN.
646993,GBW,2011-12-10 03:40:00,8460,didn't that get deleted anyway?!?!?!  all I'm saying is make sure you have a 2nd set of blades.
646995,misfish,2011-12-10 03:57:00,29133,"  Oh thats what ya meant,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,   Me bad"
647002,DRIFTER_016,2011-12-10 04:16:00,10439, Got one of them too.    
647003,misfish,2011-12-10 04:18:00,29133,OMG DROOL Thats so sweet Dave. ERA?
647007,BillM,2011-12-10 04:38:00,17367,"Brian, I've got a StrikeMaster downstairs (10in) but I need a set of new blades!"
647008,DRIFTER_016,2011-12-10 04:56:00,10439,"   Not sure of the ERA but I bought it off ebay 5 years ago. I think it was a refurb. $300 and change incl. shipping. It's a 10 1/4"" 3HP job.   The new Mo is an 8"" 3hp that will be used on them lakes wit de small fish in dem. Hoping it's a little lighter as that Strikemaster gets pretty heavy by the end of the day.  PS I always have spare blades handy. I've got 3 sets for the strikemaster one stays home and one set is in the storage pouch in my auger bag. Along with allen key, wrenches, spare plug and new rope for the pull starter. Don't want to be in the middle of nowhere with 5' of ice and a broken auger."
647010,misfish,2011-12-10 05:10:00,29133,"The one I bought last year,new 2010, is very light.It,s a 8 inch. I was very pleased with it. I,ll find out how good it really is this season.I only had 4 trips out with it last year.This year it will get a full work out.That is of course,I dont need the spud to make holes.  Southern Ontario winters are so unpreditable."
647045,Rob,2011-12-10 15:04:00,467,Why do you need to sharpen the blades or replace them so often? I've had mine for 4 years punched tons of holes and never sharpened them once. Still like new.
647058,Jds63,2011-12-10 16:37:00,1365, They have a couple left at Ajax location .....
647063,irishfield,2011-12-10 17:04:00,26272, I have the same question Rob. My little 2Hp x 9 inch lightning has THOUSANDS of holes under it's belt thanks to 6 guys all liking to use it when we're on Temagami for a week at a time. Still cuts like it was new and this will be it's 5th year.  I think part of the issue is ones like mine use the ripper blades on them and these strikemasters and the likes use the same blades the hand augers use... and they just don't hold up to the abuse of being powered.  MIND YOU.. this Tempest is showing it has a serrated tempered blade ! The strikemaster that I bought of Misfish's brother Rob had two normal blades on it just like a hand auger.
