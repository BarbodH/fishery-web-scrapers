Its a Rogers Majestic Radio but I am not sure from what year it might be or what model it is. The back of the cabinet has a small ""B510"" stamp on it. Working from what pictures are posted on-line, I was able to find a model that came close but have not been able to find this one.      Anyone have any clue as to what model and year this might be? Anyone have a link  I might check out as well?  Thanks for your help.  Meely"
