I'm curious as to how much i'm losing with my box liner.   my sled wont fit in with the new ski skins and widener kit anymore.  Thanks in advance, Matt."
647554,dhickey,2011-12-12 06:48:00,1038,Get a hitch and trailer for Xmass.. Or a full size truck. Sounds like you have a nice sled? Be a shame to not heve towing ?
647571,skeeter,2011-12-12 11:41:00,1907,"A- buy a trailer. B- put the sled in backwards. C-build a sub floor over the top of the wheel wells, then use the space under the sub floor for          storage."
647586,Nipfisher,2011-12-12 13:44:00,2449,"  Dann, option B will tear off his wind screen if he goes highway speed with out his cover on.   Matt, my guess is 2-3"" per side loss max. My little truck (2004 Ford Explorer Sportrac) has a box too small for anything except groceries so I trailer my sled. I have a nice ramp/gate on my trailer so it makes it alot nicer for loading and unloading. Additionaly my sled is 9' long so  it would hang out 4' !"
647672,BassAsin,2011-12-12 18:24:00,806,"It's not a super nice sled by any means, trailering is out of the question for me i'd much rather have the weight in my box, plus it rarely comes out over the winter months, as i'm always out on it.  its an 86 citation 250, but has always been tippy, i have to hold my smoke in the middle of my mouth or it tips. this year i have put a 3"" widening kit on it plus 8"" skins for a little more stability. currently with a box liner i have 38"" inside and need 41 to fit the sled between.  and yes blair you;re right. option B has been the cause of many lost windshields. and even worse some entire cab and windshields  together"
