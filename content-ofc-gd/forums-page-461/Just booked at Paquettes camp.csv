648212,Tom McCutcheon,2011-12-14 03:53:00,627,Is this the same Paquettes Camp that is just a little North West of Chapleau? Maybe 15 miles down the fire road from town. We passed it every year on our way into Happy Days on Windermere. This was back in the late 70's early 80's. It had a pretty good reputation at that time and looked like most of the buildings were in good shape. However I can not tell you what the fishing was like or what shape the camp is in now.  Good luck.
