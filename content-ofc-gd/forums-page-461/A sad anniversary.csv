647969,crappieperchhunter,2011-12-13 14:59:00,2582,My kids are 22 and 25 and still fumbling around with who they are and what they will become. Hell I could say the same for myself on a lot of days. But your son  recognized his passion early and made it a reality. I have a ton of respect and admiration for such individuals.  I can feel your pride come through in every word and picture.  Thank you so much for taking the time to share this with us in your beautiful tribute.
647975,ckrb2007,2011-12-13 15:18:00,449,"A very sad anniversary post by a very proud father. You had to do what every parent dreads and that makes you just as tough as your son. Thanks for posting that awesome tribute, Lew!"
647982,ccmtcanada,2011-12-13 15:37:00,7971,"I knew you had lost your son Lew, but didn't know how.  I can hear the love and pride you have for him in your words.  Thank you for sharing..."
647997,Tdel,2011-12-13 16:21:00,393,"I too remember when Lew and Gerritt both lost their son's.  Although the anniversary of what happened brings sad memories, I am sure the happiness of remembering the good times with them gives you great joy.  Tom AKA: Spider2blue."
648001,mercman,2011-12-13 16:36:00,7054,  I cant even begin to comprehend the pain of losing a child.i hope i never find out.   Paul
648002,bigbuck,2011-12-13 16:36:00,2449,"Lew, keep Jim in your heart and his memory goes on. His legacy is there for all to see in all the buildings he helped erect. Take care of your wife, daughter and yourself my friend."
648072,Rizzo,2011-12-13 21:29:00,4754,"Sadly I remember that day well also. I'm glad you posted some of the work he did, some fascinating jobs Jim was involved in. My question is, where in the world did he get the smile! That picture of Jim and Kirk in China is a great one, but we never see a smile like that from dad, must've inherited that one from mom."
648074,Twocoda,2011-12-13 21:37:00,4130,Lew your pride of your son shines through from your font and pictures....my deepest condolences on this tragic anniversary...there isnt a day that goes by that i wish my son would choose a different profession but the discription you portrayed of Jim is identical to mine (now 25)...so i can relate on what were probably your biggest fears at the time...im truely sorry that they came to fruition...but like my son...they do what they love and lived to do.... and that is not a sad thing....sadness would have come from caging these free spirit men from being who they are in life... Much respect to you and your wife on this day from a father who fears to a family that knows the only feeling a human isnt designed to feel  Gerrit - my condolences to you and yours aswell  Dave
648077,motion,2011-12-13 21:40:00,403,Thank-you for sharing this with us Lew. It is quite the tribute for your son. I will be looking at those buildings here in Toronto with a much different perspective now.  God bless.
648091,Dontcryformejanhrdina,2011-12-13 22:10:00,535,"Wow, sorry to hear about your loss. You have a lot to be proud of. The things he helped build will still be standing long after we're gone and will be enjoyed by countless people. I can't imagine the courage it takes to do that kind of work every day, either. You certainly would never catch me up that high."
648110,lew,2011-12-13 23:20:00,12766,"Thanks once again folks, your thoughts mean alot to us."
648112,Rich Clemens,2011-12-13 23:31:00,3131,I just can't imagine going through something like that Lew.  Greate tribute to a fine man.
648113,Roy,2011-12-13 23:32:00,13728,"Lew, I hope you know that I don't need to post to this thread. It broke my heart for you Diane and Sherri when I read your post seven years ago. Still does."
648114,irishfield,2011-12-13 23:33:00,26272,I'm in the same boat Roy.... I'd joined the board about 4 months before that dreadful day. Live on Lew through the memories!
648120,misfish,2011-12-13 23:49:00,29133,"Lew ,if, when, you can get past the time of hurt and can talk about yer lost ones, that make it so much easier.Not for some,but it can. I well still am at peace right now.  I too remember the day you posted, along with G.   It,s comments like this that make you say,,,,,,,,LMAO. Im sure it made you laugh aswell.  God bless."

648215,camillj,2011-12-14 04:02:00,1988,"Lew, I'll never forget that day. I was brand new to the board at the time ... man I can't believe its been seven years already - and so much more water under the bridge.  Great job on the tribute, I'm sure you think of him every single day. Gone but never forgotten.  Be well my friend."
648223,Sinker,2011-12-14 04:58:00,8692,"He will live on in your thoughts forever, Lew.   Great tribute.   S."
647897,lew,2011-12-13 09:44:00,12766,"My son Jim was always an adventurous kid growing up and loved doing crazy stuff. He was seldom afraid of dangerous situations so we weren't surprised when he told us he was gonna become an iron worker.  Their the guys that walk the narrow steel beams hundreds of feet in the air and bolt them together to form the skeletons of buildings.  He became very good at his job and ended up being one of the foremen for his company. He wasn't intimidated by heights but had a great respect for them. Strange as it seems, he always said the higher the job, the more he enjoyed it.  Safety belts are obviously mandatory for anyone doing that type of work,  but sometimes they have to unhook them to get into certain places and sadly that was when something went terribly wrong and my son fell to his death from a building they were erecting.  That was 7 years ago today.  Jim was 37 years old and had been walking the steel for 20 years.  Anyways, the last couple days I've been wandering around on the internet looking at some of the places he helped build and found some pictures of a few of the more familiar places you may know.    He did alot of the steel work in parts of Scotia Plaza and was working there the day 3 other construction workers were killed.    This is St. Mary's Cement on the 401 at Bowmanville. If you look above and behind the large building to the left of center you can see the steel cap on top of the chimney that Jim and his partner installed. Compare the size of that cap to the size of the vehicles on the ground and you can imagine how tough of a job it was to install.    When your watching the evening news and they show you  the traffic jams on the Gardner Expressway, some of the cameras are mounted on brackets that Jim installed on top of the pod on the CN Tower about 1200 feet above the city.    When you go to the Sportsman Show at the Exhibition Grounds you'll see alot of Jims work there as he installed many of the curved steel beams that form the front of the building. I always have a real feeling of pride everytime I go there and see his work.    One of his biggest jobs and one that he was really proud of was the massive Hybernia oil rig in Newfoundland. He worked on that job for a long time and put up a lot of the steel structure.  He said the most beautiful place he ever worked was near Fort St. John, in northern British Columbia  where he erected a bunch of communication towers. That was a place he even talked about retiring to when the time came  He worked all over Canada and other parts of the world but one of his favorite jobs was erecting a couple buildings in China. He spent a year in Bejing and then another year in Shanghai and was talking about going back to supervise more jobs when they were ready to go.    That's Jim on your right in the brown coat with his best bud Kirk when they were in China.  He was a big tough guy at 6' 4"" and strong as an ox but could also be as gentle as a lamb and was loved by all who knew him.  His funeral was huge and alot of the members of this board attended and for that I'll always be thankful. The number of flower bouquets we received at our home from OFNers was unbelievable and meant so much to my family. Even a month after the funeral flowers were still arriving.  Anyways, sorry for the long ramble so early in the morning, but I think of Jim always, specially on the anniversaries of his death and today I just thought I'd share some of his life with you.  "
647900,Skipper D,2011-12-13 10:12:00,1970,"Thank you Lew for sharing , it was my trade also when i was bit younger then your son was . Your story brought back things i had long forgotten . My old helment is gladly off today for you and your boy .  "

647903,spincast,2011-12-13 10:21:00,3279,Sad day indeed Lew - this was before my time on the board so the first I have heard of it.  You raised a fine young man from what I can see. He did very well with what he chose as a way of life right until the tragic events that took his life. He left some amazing contributions behind that you can be rightfully proud of.  My sympathies to you on this day that doubtless weighs heavy on your family's heart.
647904,lew,2011-12-13 10:22:00,12766,"Thanks folks, it's a tough & dangerous  job but a proud profession for those with the guts to do it."
