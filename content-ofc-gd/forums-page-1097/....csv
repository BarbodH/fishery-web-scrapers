Sometimes it falls on the bass opener, sometimes not. We've never had a whole lot of bass success that weekend anyway. The pike tourney will be a bit different. You'll have to be in conformity with the law (but if you have a livewell you can cull now). Pray for some 23.5"" pike! It will actually make it interesting to see how it affects people, especially if we get into some bruisers. There are only a few occasions where someone has brought in any big fish. The reason for the GTG has nothing to do with bass."

150302,Marty,2008-01-13 04:06:00,873,The reason for the G2G is bass . . . now that's funny.
