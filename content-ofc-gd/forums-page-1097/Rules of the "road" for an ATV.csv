150028,Terry,2008-01-12 01:40:00,14456,"you are right Wayne, but I can show you the law that states you can not ride on a trailer behind a car or truck but I can't find anything about atvs, we know you can ride in a sled/trailer behind a snowmobile..they sell them, we used to own one..but atv  it's not a car it's not a snowmobile..so who knows????"
150031,irishfield,2008-01-12 01:44:00,26272,So Big Cliff should have dragged Beans behind the ATV with a rope around his leg.... the day they forgot the helmut !
150080,BLACKFISH88,2008-01-12 05:30:00,191,"Under what legislation are ORV operators given permission to ride on provincial roads? The Red Tape Reduction Act (Bill 11) received Royal Assent on December 22, 1999, and provided enabling legislation to:  classify off-road vehicles and drivers; regulate operation on highways and prescribe conditions; and allow municipalities to pass by-laws to define access, lower speed limits and times/seasons of operation for highways under their jurisdiction (not provincial highways)."
150086,Sinker,2008-01-12 06:51:00,8692,"I've often wondered about how operators get away with having passengers in a sleigh behind a quad or skidoo.......you see it all the time......nobody has helmets on......sometimes even the driver!!  I've been driven out on the back of a 4 wheeler with no helmet before, and on the back of a sled with no helmet......the driver didn't have one on either.....what gives?  What happens if someone gets hurt and hits thier head......would the operator cover that?  Sinker"
150236,Pinch,2008-01-12 22:09:00,231," The operators are required to have a helmet as are all the passengers in whatever is being towed.  It falls under the Off Road Vehicles act.  As for liability, the owner/operator is liable if they have been paid.  If its just you pulling  some friends, then they assume the risk willingly and they are responsible for anything that happens to them."
150271,Fisherman,2008-01-13 00:56:00,7201,"19a. No person shall drive an off-road vehicle or ride on an off-road vehicle or on a conveyance towed by an off-road vehicle unless he or she is wearing a helmet that complies with the regulations, securely fastened under his or her chin with a chin strap. R.S.O. 1990, c. O.4, s. 19 (1)."
150296,Terry,2008-01-13 03:17:00,14456,well that answers that
150303,nofish4me,2008-01-13 04:21:00,404,"Wayne, I'd check out the Lake thing with insurance company. It used to be that insurance was void on the lake, with a vehicle. It's been years since I've checked, or had a need. So, what I've said may not apply."
150013,Terry,2008-01-12 01:08:00,14456,"yeah, I asked or stated just about the same thing up a few posts  and I can not find anywhere in the law where it states that if I have people on my trailer  being towed by my atv, that they need helmets  or if I can have them in my trailer going down the road...seems to be a gray area"
150016,irishfield,2008-01-12 01:11:00,26272,The other side of the coin is it's illegal to tow anyone behind your vehicle in a trailer. Does this not apply to an ATV? OR is it alright on a lake...on a rope and you say they are water skiing behind you?  Thanks Andy for the insurance estimate. What's with the huge range?
150019,Landlocked,2008-01-12 01:20:00,171,No problem...comes down to value and c.c's.
150027,irishfield,2008-01-12 01:37:00,26272,Well mine was based on a 350CC (small in this day and age) and it's a '97. It's age has no effect on liability insurance that I was quoted at $313 for 2 million. Theft/Comp was another $97 a year.
