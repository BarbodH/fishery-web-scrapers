131070,pikehunter,2007-11-07 17:41:00,1659,"My vote just made it an even 50% !!  Since my van is a '97 and the boat, motor and trailer combo is a 2005 it's value far exceeds the tow vehicle, even though it's only a tinny. Even when I bought the boat package it was worth more!  The good part of this: the van is paid for, my wife's car is paid for and the boat motor and traier are paid for too!  Edit....dunno what happened, by the time I submitted the post the count dropped down to 47 something %."

When repairs start to look like payments it will be replaced but so far I haven't spent much on it since I got it 2 years ago.  So I'd say in todays market about even, I probably couldn't sell either of them."

131129,SlowPoke,2007-11-07 21:01:00,2984,At this point I would say my boat is worth about the same as each of my vehicles. The tie breaker would be whichever one has a full tank of gas. The sad part of all of this is that my rods and tackle are worth more than my boat and either of my vehicles. -Brian
131130,JohnF,2007-11-07 21:03:00,3494, The truck was a really really really good deal huh?  JF
131137,motv8tr,2007-11-07 21:08:00,2587,"Money wise, the Truck is worth more as it's brand new...sort of, got it end of August and now have over 20,000 km on it   Personal enjoyment wise, heck NO!!!  The boat is worth way more to me   Although the truck gets me to work and back so I can someday afford to play in the boat...hmmm...guess it makes it even  Maureen"
131148,Fishmaster,2007-11-07 21:30:00,920,Boat is worth just as much as my truck till i load all my fishing gear in the boat ...then the truck is no where as close to the same amount .. i still like my O7 Dodge Hemi 4x4 but it don't catch me fish unless im towing the boat fishing ..lol...

The 2005 f-250 is worth 49.000$....when you're an engineer  for Lougheed Martin you can afford anything! Deemed to be "" The Fastest Boat on Nipissing""...and probably the hardest on gas!! The cost of it to run for a Weekend is the monthly mortgage payment on a 150.000 $ house. Useless to fish from.. or even water ski..."
131215,Mike the Pike,2007-11-08 00:47:00,3421,There about even now but the van keeps depreciating and the boat hasn't lost any cause I keep adding things to her.I could probably get the same as I paid for her.
131329,Rizzo,2007-11-08 03:46:00,4754,"the car which is 7 years old now is still worth more than the boat (8 years old).  I like the depreciation on the boat better though...the car is worth $30,000 less than when I bought it, the boat has lost only about $3000"
131340,sharper,2007-11-08 04:23:00,279,I wish I had a boat! If I had it would have to be one heck of a boat to out price my luxury sport car.
