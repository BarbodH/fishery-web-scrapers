They look like they just hatched a couple weeks ago ?  do you think the walleye are spawning twice or what ? or do some spawn this prematurely ? I've never seen this before or caught any this small period. They ate minnows the same size as them.   "
135366,camillj,2007-11-21 03:37:00,1988,Those are probably yearlings (almost)
135371,irishfield,2007-11-21 03:42:00,26272,Awfully small yearlings... The hwy 64 hatcheries releases last year were bigger than those after a few months from hatch.
135373,GbayGiant,2007-11-21 03:47:00,1780,"Yeah, I don't really know how big the average yearlings are but this picture makes it look bigger too and the other one I caught was half this size, pretty much the size of the chubs I was using."
135375,ccmtcanada,2007-11-21 03:50:00,7971,Congrats on your PB.  Look at it this way...the way you're catching them you're sure to get new pb's every time you catch them!
135376,danc,2007-11-21 03:52:00,4677," If they just hatched a couple of weeks ago, they'd be smaller than your baby finger nail and  probably not identifiable as a Walleye. They're at least a year old. Maybe two in the case of the larger one."
135378,GbayGiant,2007-11-21 03:59:00,1780," Thanks, I never seen any hatcheries or read about it before. I guess my bait is usually to big for these guys so I usually don't catch them this small, but it's good to see them in the river then."
135380,danc,2007-11-21 04:02:00,4677, It's alway good to see juveniles in the waters John. Thanks for posting the fact that you're doing just that.
150076,BLACKFISH88,2008-01-12 04:49:00,191,"I believe this is a BOQ yearling maybe two, awesome pic by the way sorry I was so late just found the post. LOL. Cheers.  P.S. ...It was released to grow many more of it's delicious kind. "
150187,mcallister.grant,2008-01-12 19:36:00,327,"That first fish is a yearling for sure. The only grow about 3-4 inches in their first year and than they grow quite rapidly. Actually, they never stop growing their entire life!"
