The lake that I am going to is pretty small, and it is about 1/2 hour north of North Bay.  Does anyone have any info on ice conditions on some of the smaller lakes around there?  The lake is mostly pike, so that is what I will be targetting.  Is it ok to use minnows that I buy somewhere around there, or do they have to be collected from the lake on which you are fishing?  I would hate to introduce a new species to a small lake.  Any advice on fishing for pike in this area would be greatly appreciated.  Usually I stick with minnows, but I am trying to diversify a bit!  Cheers!  Happy fishing."
