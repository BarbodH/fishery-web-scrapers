150065,jjcanoe,2008-01-12 03:29:00,744,Regulation Changes  Well here's the first of probably many updates to the new regs.  I hope they have the new new regs out in time for the Sportsmans Show!  jjcanoe
150088,Woodsman,2008-01-12 09:32:00,1286,"Don't expect a new new regs out. That costs money. Their solution: this line ""Anglers may wish to insert this page of changes into their copy of the summary."""
150146,jjcanoe,2008-01-12 15:44:00,744,"Yeah I know, It's just gonna create some loop holes for poachers and abusers.  jjcanoe"
150220,douG,2008-01-12 21:20:00,2693,"I picked up a hard copy yesterday of fishing regs for 2008 - 2009.  The districts are completely redrawn, with Anstruther in the same region as Algonquin, for example.  I find em much easier to read, a good change in format."
150922,Casey123,2008-01-15 01:08:00,461,"""...Anglers may wish to insert this page of changes into their copy of the summary.""  Anyone besides me feel like telling Dalton McGinty and the honorable Minister of Natuarl Resourses where they can insert my foot... into their summary"
150927,fishindevil,2008-01-15 01:30:00,6254,"Well at least they finally got finished,i think they are easier to read,and yes they did re-designate all the areas,and made some positive changes,so well see how much problems it will cause in the spring when fishing starts again...."
150930,John Bacon,2008-01-15 01:46:00,3277," I would argue that they are not actually finished.  If they were finished, they wouldn't require revisions.  I expect that there will be further changes to the regs this year.  I know that the limit for Rainbow on lake Ontario is under review.  Appearently the MNR has stated that changing the regs after they are printed in not a problem"
