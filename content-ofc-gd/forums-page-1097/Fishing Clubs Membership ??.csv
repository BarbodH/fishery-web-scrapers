150394,JerseyDog,2008-01-13 17:08:00,190,"It has been said above, but I look at OFC as a club and the only one I really need and/or have time for.  There is a decent, engaged and friendly executive committee, the dues are reasonable and there is an open discussion that runs 24/7 on multiple topics at a time.  There is a mix of age levels, experience levels, geographic locations and a wide variety of interests from angling specific interests to other outdoor interests to a myriad of other related and unrelated topics.  There is a virtual tourney for bragging rights, there are regular social events and even a polling system so the membership can vote on different things.  Like a lot of others, I do not have the time to actually go somewhere, sit in a meeting, deal with the politics, stick to a one topic agenda someone else set, etc. When I do have time, I would prefer to spending it fishing, golfing or just hanging around. And since the OFC meeting is 24/7 I can engage on my terms and when I have time.  I think lots of old school clubs are being replaced by more virtual social clubs because they offer a lot of the same benefits and maybe even more information, flexibility and social opportunities."

150366,Fish Farmer,2008-01-13 15:12:00,2234,"I thank you guys very much for your input. I see a few things that have been mentioned that may help. I'll be sending this thread to our clubs executive. I probably should have mentioned The Stelco, and Dofasco clubs run on a 75%, 25%. employee & outside associate membership, which makes things a little difficult to bring outsiders in. On the other hand, the Golden Horseshoe club is open for everyone. Anglers helping anglers,that's what it's all about,""OFC"" I thank you all again very much for your help. PS Terry, whats wrong with flipping the Mods a few chicken Wings once in awhile. lol Gerritt, see you at the next meeting bud. Bring that Spiel Guy!lol"
150376,Guest lundboy,2008-01-13 15:45:00,0,"I stuck it out at a club for a couple of seasons but things were WAY TOO political.  The membership was not growing, but shrinking.  As Lew mentioned cliques.  There were (maybe still) a lot of pro anglers in the club.  Most of which pretty well stuck to themselves and ignored everyone else.  The meeting consisted of basically walking into the restaurant's private area, buy a drink or a dinner, and everyone would sit around watching the ""pros"" chat amongst themselves.  The president (one of the ""pros"") and executive, did very little to structure the meetings or to even keep up with the club promised membership benefits except when elections happened or dues were payable.  The only events that were kept were the mini 5pm-9pm weekday tournaments which were tough for me to attend due to work schedule and travel  The new (current) president basically picked the match ups with pro (boater) to am (non-boater) depending on who he and his clique liked, not by the club mandated random draws.  The reason these tourneys were kept up is because the ""pros"" cleaned up in 90% of them, and got the prize money.  They also got club sponsored paid entries into the major tourneys like CFT by winning all the club tourneys.  There was even a very embarrassing situation where the executive got in an argument with the mini tourney marina launch site owner over having to pay $2 more for a launch than the site across the river which was not as good, while the club (not me) drank beer and threw garbage on his property after each tourney!  This was terribly embarrassing to me because I  was renting summer boat storage from this marina at the time and didn't want to be painted with the same brush. Can you imagine...  ""pros"" with $60,000+ boats whining about $2 more for a better launch??  (The price was $7, a discount from the marina's usual $10, and the other launch was $5)  Not once (when I was there) did the members get their promised benefits such as:  -MEMBERSHIP IN THE OFAH -MAGAZINE SUBSCRIPTION TO Ontario OUT OF DOORS -MONTHLY SEMINARS FROM SOME OF CANADA'S BEST BASS ANGLERS AND PRODUCT REPS -PROOF OF INSURANCE -WINTER 1 DAY PRO SEMINAR -DEALS AND DISCOUNTS ON TACKLE AND ACCESSORIES -TACKLE SWAPS -LAKE CLEAN-UP DAYS  I had recommended at least two of my friends to join up while I was there, they each came to a meeting but found it to not be worth joining because of the alienation.  I made my point of view many times during the meetings, and especially well known at the end of my membership to the president, and also the CFT liason.  But was quickly dismissed as sour grapes.  I might add that a ""new"" bylaw has been added in which no member can:  ""Publicly attack, malign, slander, or beset any member, affiliate or stakeholder"" or they will loose their membership.  I agreee that this is a good thing to follow,  but due to the inability of certian members of the executive being able to take criticism, the discussions quickly turn into slander and beseting.  Note also that these rules for some reason don't apply to the clique.  So....  does anyone wonder why the clubs are failing?  Maybe BassPro's club is better since it's kind of associated with BP and would have to be careful how they function.  But it was affiliated with this one above, and some of it's members were/are part of the clique and executive of the one above, and are active members of this board also."
150383,camillj,2008-01-13 16:21:00,1988,"I think the whole 'club' (not just fishing) thing is challenged by a changing environment were fewer and fewer people have the luxury of time and everyone has to make tougher choices on how to spend that time. Having said that, I think its a conversation that happens every few years in every club.  Clubs will always have to compete with all the other demands on its members attention in a world where the membership has many choices about how to get the value out of its investment of time and in a world where the perception of value is always changing.  The internet is definitely one competitor - not just because of instant  information - but also because it is an easily accessible way to get a quick 'fix'  of comradery (with little demand, commitment or obligation) through forums like this one and without the personal penalties associated with a whole night (or day) out.  For those who have earned the luxury of time there will always be clubs ... the key will be finding ways to offer good (like minded) people a worthwhile return on their investment and accepting that not all members have the same interest or ability to participate but keeping them engaged regardless so that there are others to share that time with.  In the case of the club I am a member of, this means accepting that once or twice a year is it ... and keeping those few get togethers worth it for everyone. (For me its quality not  quantity that keeps the club going)"
