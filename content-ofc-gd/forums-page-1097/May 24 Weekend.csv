The past 5 years we have fished either the French River or Lake Nip., and this year we want to try a new location  closer to Toronto.  Typically we rent a cottage and boat for the weekend and fish all day and all night.  Can someone please suggest a new location.  We enjoy fishing for perch, pickerel and pike. Thanks for you help."

150032,silveradosheriff,2008-01-12 01:45:00,1025,You'll enjoy the moon and Bill at Moon River Cottages is a great guy! Careful though - it has taken a prop or two.  :-)

150126,Mike the Pike,2008-01-12 15:01:00,3421, Yup Bay of Quinte is not far from Toronto the Walleye usually bite very well with the odd pike in the 3 to 12 pound range.Nice size perch too.  Lots of places to stay.Navigation is a breeze and many very friendly people.  I will be staying at Mohawk Bay Campround May 24 weekend.you can rent trailers and boats there.  Bayside Cottages is another great location.I stay there during the Quinte tournament.
