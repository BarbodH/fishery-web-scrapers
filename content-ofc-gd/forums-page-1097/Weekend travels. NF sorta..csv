It would shake the cottage on some of the largest shakes. Was talking to Marc at Anglers Haven on my way home today and he figures it was because of the rising water level. Took some shots while I was out there.  A shot of my place in the sunset.   On my way home today took a shot of where the truck went through during the mild spell. They are trying to get it out. They were flooding the area around it for the last few days to make it strong enough to lift. Apparently the towing operators slid a snowmachine into the hole so now they have to get it out too. You can just see the roof of the truck sticking out. "
