150165,kemper,2008-01-12 17:21:00,2232,"Had a great day on the river this morning. Went 3/4 in 2 hours, and managed my New PB! Started out with a small guy, 3-4 pounds then they got bigger ending the morning with a 32 Inch monster bow.  Heres the first one, nice little girl. VERY fresh and gave a great fight, lots of acrobatics. Fun on the pin!     And here is the brute of the day, coming in at 32 inches. Fought for so long I thought the arms were gonna come off...or the 4 lb test was gonna break...    "
150166,camillj,2008-01-12 17:29:00,1988,You can probably re-size if you just right-click on the file from explorer ...  What were the water conditions ? Was thinking of heading east this morning but figured I would give it a few more days ...
150169,Lostchild,2008-01-12 17:38:00,153,"Sounds like you had a good day!  You can resize them if you have ""paint"" program.  Open picture in ""paint"". Click on ""image"" on the top tool bar. Click stretch/skew. Change the numbers from 100% to something like 50%. (depending on the size of the image, you can play with the numbers to get the right size) Once done, click ""save as"".  Good luck!"

150190,Roy,2008-01-12 20:02:00,13728,You did good. Congrats to you and thank you for posting the pics.
150191,douG,2008-01-12 20:04:00,2693,"Attaboy, Kemper.  You did better than I did today.  Bill Parker showed me a spot on the Credit this morning, and gave me my first lesson in float fishing rivers.  There were no fish for either of us, but I appreciated his patience and the advice he provided.  After a couple of hours, I thought it was time to return the favour, so I introduced him to pho at a nearby Vietnamese restaurant.  He took to it like a native, and handled the chopsticks, chili paste and hoisin like a pro.  Thanks again, Parker.  We will find a fish next time, and if not, we can find some pho for sure."
