Picked up a friend from work who has never fished for steelhead in his life.  Hooked him up w/ a rod ,reel and smokes and he was on his way. We got there at the break of dawn, super high dirty water greeted us when we arrived (expected) but it was still nice to get a line wet. Unfortunatly we had a time limit. 12pm..... In the 5 Hour span we brought in 2 fish... enjoy!  B with his first ever steelhead 6lbs 3 oz.. (the pictures were not taken on my camera, they were on B's camera -- so these are pics are pics of the pics he took..sheesh!)   me with my steelie 9 lbs 8oz   Was a good day for 5 hours of fishing considering the conditions...  Joe"

There's something about catching these guys in the rivers on a cold winters day.  Hooking them, and the adrenaline that follows keeps you warm even on the coldest days.  Great job out there guys."
