Snuck out for 2 hours this morning and is was bonkers from the minute we arrived to the minute we left.  All fish on green roe sacs under float.    Then it was time to wash up and get to moms for pig out and watch some football. The cake was great but getting on in years isn't.    My mom has a keen interest in my fishing addiction and really likes me to stay dry and also catch big ones. Thanks Mom for the new Gore-tex and Husky Jerk!! All in all a great birthday!!

150619,charlied,2008-01-14 03:40:00,584,Happy B-Day...mine is also today the 13th of January.  Haven't known anyone with the same day all my life and just this year I have found 3 people with the same B-day....weird.  Hope you had a good day!

150669,ccmtcanada,2008-01-14 13:19:00,7971,Great report!  There's nothing like the anticipation...watching your float drift by a spot you think holds a fish....then seeing it drop!  You set the hook....and then you feel the resistance at the end.  Then the fight ensues.  At that point it doesn't really matter if you land the fish or not...the adrenaline is already pumping!  Man...I gotta get out and fish more often....LOL.  Great pics and Happy Birthday!
150708,wuchikubo,2008-01-14 15:40:00,1114,Happy belated birthday Mark!
