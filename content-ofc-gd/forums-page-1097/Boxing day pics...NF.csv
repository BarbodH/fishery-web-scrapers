150143,Photoz,2008-01-12 15:41:00,792,"Beauty shots . . . .    but . . . . .     pictures #1 & #4 . .   .   .     the way the snow has formed, only on one side of the branches  . . . .     much like you'd get if you were close to big water, and fog blew in, and formed . . . . .    looks kinda surreal?"

150346,fish_finder,2008-01-13 14:11:00,370,"  odd as it seems, I don't think it snowed that day 9or overnight), but instead I think it was from the fog that settled over much of southern Ontario that resulted in that beautiful display of nature!!  I managed to see the same thing from Guelph up to Southampton that day, but there was no fresh snow on the ground anywhere!!  dave"
150348,mcallister.grant,2008-01-13 14:14:00,327,Very nice pics. That last one is very cool!

150371,Beans,2008-01-13 15:34:00,3339, Yep F_F you got it right...frozen fog...here's a pic of it on our way down to T.O. from Innisfil...  
150379,lew,2008-01-13 16:06:00,12767,"Some really beautiful pictures there Dan, thanks.  I'm not a fan of winter at all, but must admit, it sure can be purdy sometimes."
150594,Dano,2008-01-14 02:33:00,719,"Thanks all, it was a beautiful morning, the frost was formed by the heavy fog and dropping temps we had that night. The snow was crunchy cold. In that last pic, you can see smoke that looks like it is coming from my dog Lucys', head. That is from a barn that caught fire two lines east of us that morning, there was some livestock lost as well as the barn. Very sad."
150611,Rattletrap2,2008-01-14 03:27:00,1652,Very cool shots there Neighbour! Thanks for posting them!
