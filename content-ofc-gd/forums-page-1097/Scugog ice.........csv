150057,CRAPPIE,2008-01-12 02:53:00,213,"I just want to know which area can i go out tommorrow with safe ice, not asking your spot but just want to know which area, Caerera or somewhere? I will fishining alone and want to play safe.  Thanks in advance"
150170,Sinker,2008-01-12 17:42:00,8692, Saying that is your first mistake! Don't go alone!!
150182,Cookslav,2008-01-12 19:01:00,1457,"Man that first one is a pig of a Crappie!  Glad you guys a had a good outting. I gotta say though, I'm surprised there were that manny people out? I was by Scugog on Thursday, and it looked pretty soft round Port Perry. Scarey soft....and not a soul in sight on the ice.  I'm guessing its a bit thicker else were?"
150216,jhm,2008-01-12 21:04:00,15,"There was at least 8"" of ice.............Talked to Causeway Bait and Tackle today he said ice is good still...........lots of people out today..............I'm going again tomorrow..........JHM"
150230,CRAPPIE,2008-01-12 21:51:00,213,Did the bait shop specify what area? It is kind of risky to guess where should we head out. Port Perry in town? Goreski or William point. Whoever went out today if they are kind to give us some advise is much appreciated!  Thanks!
150246,jhm,2008-01-12 22:48:00,15,We went out of Gorski's.............JHM
