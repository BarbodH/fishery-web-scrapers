I was told it used V8 for the base. Can any one help me out, not even sure what issue it was in and so far cannot get logged in to their site to ask them."

150421,bbog,2008-01-13 20:00:00,665,The venison stew was a fantastic recipe - enjoyed it so much I made the Fish Cake recipe that followed in the next issue (and now can't wait to see the recipe in the next issue). OOD  Of course I'd rather be out fishing.
