150052,wallyboss,2008-01-12 02:47:00,1095,DIY what? Clean it ? Make one? shorten one? lenghten one?
150055,JustinHoffman,2008-01-12 02:50:00,482,"If you're talking cleaning, lightly sand with a fine-grit sandpaper, then wipe down with a wet cloth. Will look like it just came off the tackle store shelf!  Good Fishing, Justin"

150087,drwxr,2008-01-12 08:47:00,453,"yes i need info how to make one: cut pieces, glue them and put on the rod, what glue to use and so on. any info would be nice thanks guys."

150204,GbayGiant,2008-01-12 20:37:00,1780,"I've seen that site before Roy, very nice work, I'm always tempted to get one."
150206,drwxr,2008-01-12 20:40:00,453,"wow Roy, that site is good, and the work is amazing, but its too much of a mission for me. i found a fast way here http://www.flyanglersonline.com/begin/graphite/part5.html if anyone else interested thanks for all help."
