149989,Jer,2008-01-11 23:36:00,1426,"I did a lot of driving yesterday in the Haliburton area and must have passed at least fifty lakes between Carnarvon, Haliburton, Wilberforce, Bancroft and back down to Buckhorn...I wouldn't step foot on any of them, really nasty looking ice, lotsa open water, lotsa running water and the shorelines are all broken up. Hardly an ice-hut to be seen anywhere.  Boshkung, Maple, Grass, Kashagawigamog, Baptiste, Paudash...you name it...they all looked terrible. Water levels are up to spring run-off levels, higher than I saw all last summer. The main ice may be OK...getting off the shore would be a challenge.  Maybe a few days of colder temps will firm things up, but this weekend could be tricky.  Play Safe!"
150694,oldphart,2008-01-14 15:04:00,665,"~~~I finally got hold of Terry at Eagle Lake Adventures, and he gave me almost the same report, on the lakes, they should be okay this coming weekend, with Temps down around -18 on Saturday night, and Sunday. Slug and Shovel were up there on Sat. and also report weak ice near shore."
