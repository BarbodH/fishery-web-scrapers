Checked out some of the normal eastern tribs to find about 30 cars at each parking lot so we decided to do some investigating.  We knew of a small creek to fish but took us a while to find the parking lot.  We finally found it and met 2 guys there who were about as surprised to see us as we were to see them.  Anyways they took the first corner hole and my 2 buddies took the next and i continued upstream and fished the last hole on the stretch before you were beyond the boundary.  My first drift i hooked a 12+ pound fish which broke me off cuz my drag was not set.  Few drifts later hooked and landed a nice fresh male about 8-9 pounds.  To wrap things up I ended up going 5 for 7, my friend Brad ended up going 3 for 6, and my friend Aaron goin 2 for 5.  I am having some internet troubles so i am using a friends computer so i will post pictures as soon as my internet is back up and running.  Hawk"
