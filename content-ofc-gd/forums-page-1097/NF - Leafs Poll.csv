150038,tapout,2008-01-12 02:05:00,166,Not everyone has to go.  For god sakes leave the Zamboni Driver out of this.  Hes been doing a great job!
150074,John Bacon,2008-01-12 04:28:00,3277,"Richard Peddie and Larry Tannenbaum need to go first.  No decent general manager will work for them.  Turfing JFJ while they are still around is going to help the team.  The general manager should be allowed to decide who coaches the team; so it would make sense to keep Maurice around for now.  The new GM can decide his fate later.  It would be nice to trade some of the players fro draft choices; unfortunately, the veterans all seem to have no trade clauses, bloated contracts that no other team will accept, or both.  I think it will take a long time to rebuilding the team wants the team actually starts rebuilding.  Who knows if and when they will even start."
150084,SlowPoke,2008-01-12 06:17:00,2984,"I'm not buying into the money arguement - maybe in the old (pre-cap) days but not now. I've also heard enough about the Teachers Pension Fund. They're entitled to make money and don't you think they wouldn't mind a few extra playoff game revenues? Of course! This isn't about complacent ownership, it is about inept ownership. Unfortunately we can't fire the owners.  This team is happy to spend up to the cap and obviously have no qualms in over-paying management and coaching staffs.  I have no doubt in my mind that the team would benefit from a hockey minded person given carte blanche. They have the means to attract the right individual but who in thier right mind would want to work for such a meddling group of power-hungry owners. Well, Colangelo took the plunge with the Raptors. Time will tell whether that was the correct decision.  In the meantime, I'd be surprised if JFJ gets to see more than another week with the Leafs.  -Brian"

150437,irishfield,2008-01-13 21:28:00,26272,BTW.. did they let Ferguson on the plane last night or leave him in CA to find a new job?
150438,gozwob,2008-01-13 21:32:00,34,they sucked then......they suck now.........and they'll suck in the future.   that is all.

150515,Squid,2008-01-13 23:50:00,1656,"As scotty Bowman said, he wanted the same as Cogliano(sp) has with the Raps, complete control as VP. MLSE said no way, so there is your problem MLSE."

150554,Roy,2008-01-14 01:05:00,13728,Here we are in January and this is the first Leafs post of the season. What's wrong? Are folks backing away from hockey?
150560,danc,2008-01-14 01:14:00,4677," We're trying to get an NHL franchise here in Thunder Bay Roy, but since Toronto is so much bigger, they'll probably get one before we do."
150626,kennyman,2008-01-14 04:10:00,737,"WOW,very well said Grant.I'm a lifer as well and just as frustrated. I'm afraid that poor Paul Maurice is going to take the fall. I think he's a good coach and I don't believe for a second that this mess is his fault. Now for the poll I'm answering Sundin. I am a big Sundin fan, but the Leafs should trade some of their older big $$$  players while they can get good value in return (draft picks and young talent).Let's face it, what playoff contending team couldn't use Sundin? He'd be an asset anywhere.  They need to bring in a ""Bowman"" and start from the scouting and work his way up. What the Leafs really need is a multi billlionaire who is a die hard hockey fan (who wants nothing more than to win) to buy the team, hire Scotty Bowman and give him the control he wants and needs to turn this franchise around. Then the fans need to give him the time to make it happen. It can't happen overnight. They'll suck for a while ...... yes even more than they do. The people who really ""bleed blue and white"" will understand and accept it if they can see light at the end of the tunnel. No one else matters. The team will make money anyway. They're the second richest team in hockey (next to the Rangers) and now that there's a cap in place monkeys could make a fortune there (we have proof). AND we also have proof that when done correctly a team can be turned around quite dramatically in a timely fashion (eg:Collangelo). Anyone who watched the Raps game today will attest to that!! Any billionaires on this site?? I hear there's a hockey team for sale."
149891,tonyb,2008-01-11 19:37:00,1637,"I agree it is frustrating being a Leafs fan and watching them lose game after game and trying to blame someone for all of it, players, management, coaches, etc...  The reality is that it is above all else, a business.  With that being said...look at what everyone is saying...  ""The ""body"" that is the Toronto Maple Leafs is diseased. It has only one focus, huge profits and returns on investment.""  ""The teacher's pension fund doesn't care if they win or lose, they're making huge profits and they're selling lots of condos around the ACC.""  ""75% of the ACC is corporate tickets!!! And if you are lucky enough to get a ticket, you are out a weeks pay (for most people). They were the ONLY team in the league not to lower ticket prices after the lockout!! Hell, they raised the prices!!! This is the end result of a company that is being dictated by a MONSTER PENSION PLAN that only sees number and not results!!!""  If it were me at the top, I wouldn't change a single thing with this successful business model, so don't expect them to just to make the die-hard fans happy...sad, unfortunate, but an absolute reality.

149906,uglyfish,2008-01-11 20:08:00,981,"Ferguson has to go, the only reason he got the job is his name. because of who his father was. it was the only credibility he had coming in, and goin out... he don;t even have that anymore. Sundin is next, only because he will demand more in a return then any other player has in the past 10 years at the deadline. they can easily get a couple prospects and a few high draft picks for him. then, hes an unrestricted free agent at years end, he can sign back after a 3 or 4 month leave. next would be toskala, again should be able to get a few decent draft  picks for him. raycroft should have started from the beginning of the season and left in net. he is a far better goalie then toskala. and for those of u who will argue with me, and say look at the numbers... just watch the games, raycroft hasn;t got ANY support from his team in any game this year. there is only so much a goalie can do, but u need ur team to score goals upfront, and play solid defense in their own end, and they have done neither when raycroft plays. maurice should be kept in place, because he is a good coach and is good with young players. ferguson and peddie need to piss off and allow him to run his team on the ice the way he sees fit without having to listen to those 2 hockey no nothings. they have a solid blueline when they decide to play, and that should be a place for them to focus on. strong defense, work that into a quick transition game using the speed u have upfront and get shots on net. they have good guys on D who can move the puck very well, they just need to be sound positionally  much better and then work on moving it up ice to generate offense. guys like blake need to seriously step it up, hes being paid a lot of money to put the puck in the net, and isn;t doin so. steen, stajen, ponikrovsky and wellwood also need to play a lot better. wellwood prolly won;t get into a full game shape till next season though, its hard to come in halfway through and keep up with everyone else, and usually don;t happy often. but he is moving better lately and moving the puck better, so hopefully he starts clicking more. they have to use their speed and forecheck to create momentum in their favor. when they hit, they play better and win games. all thats left, lose every game the rest of the way,and get the number 1 overall pick... and for the love of god don;t trade it away!! and make sure ferguson is gone by draft time or he'll screw that up too!"
149907,misfish,2008-01-11 20:12:00,29133," LOL Without even reading the responses I voted other. I had the same as Wayne.  The fans stop going,how do they pay thier wages???????????????"
149908,KyleM,2008-01-11 20:12:00,218,"Stoty, Sundin is playing some of his best hockey this year.  I gave up on these clowns a few years ago and started cheering for my B team.  Cant blame the players.......the teams at its cap and it looks like an AHL team. They have a couple of the worst contracts in history.  Cant blame Raycroft for everything.......would be nice to have some D infront of the nets.   The Leafs need to borrow some of the Raptors management for a season."
149912,misfish,2008-01-11 20:17:00,29133, I hear there are rumors that this may just happen.
149918,bbog,2008-01-11 20:32:00,665,Firing Ferguson won't change a thing with the clowns above him still in place. MLSE has the most dysfunctional organizational structure if you believe winning is the goal. Clearly making money is the only priority and has been for the last 40 years.  Adopt another team if you want to support a winner.
149946,troutologist,2008-01-11 21:44:00,951,No one shoots into shin pads as accurately as mccabe! management is at the root as are the players greed. If you wanna win the cup you take less cash to bring in a supporting cast....making top dollar and losing rules!
149970,lunkerbasshunter,2008-01-11 22:49:00,2585,"i disagree with what anyone says negative about richard peddie.  Here is why.  MLSE is a business and he makes them money year after year.  If i owned mlse he would be my number one guy and I would love the guy!  As for the hockey operations?  It starts with jfj and goes down.   this year and next year you need to sell off for draft picks and prospects and rebuild like pittsburgh has, chigaco is doing.  Then when you have a good group of young players then go get a couple key veterens in the free agent market to complete the team and compete for the cup.  It really is that simple, however dont expect a winning product for another 4 seasons.  It happens all the time around that league.  Leaf fans are always wanting ""this year"" and in realitly its better to sacrifice sometimes to get something better in return at a later date.  Cheers!"
149987,gone_fishin,2008-01-11 23:29:00,481,"JFJ has to be the first to go, for obvious reasons... the horrific deals and signings he has made in the past few years, he can't be allowed to stay past the trade deadline because he is bound to make more stupid deals.  Second and Third is Sundin and Raycroft. Sundin, even though is is playing great this year, we need to trade him to get some prospects and high draft picks, and there is a good chance that he wont be playing next year anyway... this is the last year of his contract. Of course he will have to waive his no trade clause. what they should do is make a deal with Sundin and tell him that if he chooses to play again next year, the leafs will pick him up as a free agent in the summer. It's a win/win for both parties, Sundin will have a chance at the cup with a playoff bound team, and the leafs will get Sundin back for next year, and they will still have the players that they get from that trade.  Raycroft has got to go, so that Pogge and Clemensen aren't sharing ice time for the Marlies. once Raycroft is gone, Clemensen can be the back-up for the Leafs and Pogge can have the #1 position and get enough ice time playing with the Marlies.  Lets just hope the leaf's scouts do a better job this year with the good draft positions that we will have this summer."
