Than got out in the bahamas for some deep sea fishing.   Had one hook up all morning heres the little fella he was snagged in the tail and dead by the time he was boatside.  Fished for a bit at our resort but no luck,  shoulda've brought my rod to the atlantis.   Heres a cool shot our last day from the beach "

Good to see you didn't involuntarily donate a kidney whilst changing your name to corona.  Tu gusta pescar eh? Mi gusta nadar & pescar.  Did you see the Dorado?  Ah, Holidays in the sun  Cheers,"

Unfortunately, I didn't get into any fishing.   I'd love to go back some day.  I liked their exchange rate:   1 US Dollar = 2 Belize Dollars"
