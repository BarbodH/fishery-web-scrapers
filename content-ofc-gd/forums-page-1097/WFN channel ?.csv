Out of all the channels on Bell satellite it's the only one that sounds scratchy and distorted, this is with a surround sound set-up or without, no matter what it sounds bad and all other channels sound good.  I love the channel I watch it all the time but the sound needs to improve, Its not just certain shows either it's every show all day so it must be a station related problem."

150208,GbayGiant,2008-01-12 20:41:00,1780,Thanks Lew.  Anyone on Bell notice it ?
150210,cranks bait,2008-01-12 20:46:00,721,We are on Bell.  The sound is clear.  Although the shows I have to turn the sound right up.  Then jump as the comercials come on really LOUD!!!
150213,GbayGiant,2008-01-12 20:55:00,1780,"Hmmmm, I guess it's just me for some reason. I actually produce sound (just a hobby) and have very nice speakers and a good ear for quality, maybe my speakers are just so clear it's picking up the scratchiness, weird.   I know what you mean a lot of channels are like that, those damn commercial guys are too loud."
150237,lunkerbasshunter,2008-01-12 22:10:00,2585,star choice here and have had no problem at all.  cheers!
150239,bassboy,2008-01-12 22:19:00,161, I am on Bell Distressview too......and the loud commercials really make my toes curl backwards. Especially the blonde ditz advertising bored games.  Sound is ok though.  Bill
