150240,ccmtcanada,2008-01-12 22:24:00,7971,"Ricoboxing and I have been trying to hook up for a few weeks now, but unfortunately, he had some errands to run, so at the last minute, I decided to head out on my own.  Well, with all the warm temps and lots of rain I was hoping that my local trib was higher than my ankles.  I got down there at around 2pm and looked at the water.  WOW!!! The levels were near normal!  It was a bit dirty, but there was about a foot to 18"" of visibility.  I was glad I tied up larger roe bags in chartreuse and pink last night.  I also wanted to field test a new pack I bought on ebay just before Christmas.  Here's a pic.  The front pouch has lots of storage in it.  It's very lightweight and comfortable.  My camera, and all my tackle fit in there.    I got this pack for $5.00 plus $14 in shipping, so I'm quite happy with it.  Anyhow, onto the fish.  I went to one of my favourite spots and on the second drift, my float went down!  Here's a pic of the fight on it's way in.   A few minutes later, this little guy came in.   There was nothing else coming in from that hole, so I moved along to another fav spot of mine and chatted with a guy fishing the opposite bank.  I asked him how he's been doing and he said very slow.  On my first drift, my float goes down and I landed a bigger one than my first.   About 10 minutes later, in that same spot, I land another smaller fish.  I didn't care how big they were...I haven't caught a fish since November...LOL.   Anyhow...that was it...2 hours of fishing and 4 fish.  I lost a few along the way for good measure as well, but it's sure felt good to hook into a few.  Hopefully, this weather will hold up and I can get out a few times before the spring run."
