517979,laszlo,2010-11-06 11:35:00,487, Thanks Fidel. You know how much I love that dog. My heart is in pain but I feel like she's going to an amazing place which helps a lot!
517982,Jewelbee,2010-11-06 12:26:00,422,Oh how sad   .....I could NEVER part with my boys! But I understand your decision was probably a very tough one. Good luck with placing her!
517996,highdrifter,2010-11-06 13:46:00,2534," I can only imagine..  I'd take her if it meant having you visit more often, but I can't even feed myself most of the time.."
519618,laszlo,2010-11-13 12:44:00,487,"Thanks to all of you that offered a new home for Ida and had reassuring words of wisdom.  Today is her last day with us at home. Tomorrow morning, I leave for Temagami to drop her off to her new owners Carrie and Doug (aka - John the Fisherman). After talking with them I feel like I couldn't have found a better situation for her. She will continue to be a very happy, loving dog.  So many adventures we shared. She will be missed beyond words.         Laz"
519712,irishfield,2010-11-13 22:39:00,26272,"She'll enjoy the freedom of running around Bear Island Lasz and be in good hands, while breathing clean air."
519715,GBW,2010-11-13 22:42:00,8460,Sad but good to hear at the same time.

517272,laszlo,2010-11-04 00:09:00,487,"Hello Everyone.  My wife is starting an in-home daycare and it seems most clients are put off by the fact that we have a dog.  She (Ida) is a Pure Bred Weimaraner in perfect health, fixed and is 6 years old. If your not familiar with the breed, they are very athletic/energetic and require 30-45 minutes of OFF LEASH exercize daily. I can't stress that enough. She has all her shots, is great with kids, and is full of love.  This breed needs to be in the home with the family and would not do well as a yard dog. She would be a great partner for any hunters that target field birds.  Pics...         This is an unbelievably difficult thing to do so finding the right home for her is very important to us. Please personal message me for any inquiries and even if she's not for you please spread the word.  We will take the best offer.  Thanks Laszlo"
517276,Nipfisher,2010-11-04 00:15:00,2449,"She is a beautiful dog. What is her name? Also for people considering helping out, is she for sale? It would be great for you if she could find a good home in your area so you could se her time-to-time. I wish you success in finding another home that will care for her as much as your family does. It is very difficult thing to do. Best wishes."
517287,laszlo,2010-11-04 00:46:00,487, Thanks. I made changes the the original post.
517346,Harrison,2010-11-04 11:18:00,2202,Been there bud. One of the toughest things I had to do. But my boy found an amazing home with an OFNer.  I wish you the same luck. Phil
517370,Chance,2010-11-04 13:26:00,420,"Hi Lazlo,  I also have a weimaraner and agree they are wonderful caring dogs.I cannot stress enough to those considering a weim that they do need that exercise.Once the exercise session is complete they go right back to being couch potatoes lol.  Have you contacted your breeder as most will take dogs back regardless of age.I purchased my pup years ago from a gentleman by the name of Tom Lyons from weatherrun weimaraners.He has been breeding weims for over 40 years and could possibly provide you with a new home for your girl or might know someone who would. Worth a call.  Cheers"
517376,NAW,2010-11-04 13:44:00,4022,"I could never give my girl up.  I can't imagine what your going through right now.  I can't offer your dog a home, but I can wish you luck!  Hopefully it all works out for you man."
517380,frozen-fire,2010-11-04 13:52:00,542,Tough decision. I hope it all works out...best of luck.
517440,Dozer,2010-11-04 17:24:00,896,"Damn, good luck finding her a good home, I feel for you buddy, I'd really hate having to make up a decision between giving up my dog for an idea my wife made.  The force is strong in you, you will catch lots of fish in the future."
517446,Harrison,2010-11-04 18:20:00,2202,"Just to add....  My Misses tried the home daycare route as well.  She had the best intentions and is fantastic with kids......but..... it is a very fickle biz!  It would be a shame if she is just trying it out, and after a few months things didn't work out and you've given your pooch away...  Just something else to think about."
517455,GBW,2010-11-04 19:04:00,8460,"Oh so very true as my wife is doing the home daycare thing.  The best ""clients"" to get are the ones on your street that see you and your dog all the time.  My dog get's happy when all the kids' show up.  She's even happier when they all go home, so she can get some rest..."
517548,laszlo,2010-11-04 23:29:00,487,bump.
517592,GBW,2010-11-05 01:29:00,8460,still waiting to hear back on 2 for ya bud!
517672,blaque,2010-11-05 13:12:00,2419,"Hate to be the one to say it.......and i dont mean it in a harsh way, but i dont think it would be very hard to come up with alternatives to keep your furry family member and try your business venture at the same time. I dont know your entire situation, so i could be wrong, im just trying to help you out as im sure its tearing at you. You look like two peas in a pod in your avatar.  Can you board the dog during daycare hours Can you bring her to work with you during daycare hours Can you find someone that would dogsit during the day and pick her up after work Do you have a large property that you could put a small kennel away from the house She looks good with kids, could you introduce clients to the pup and show them how docile she is and maybe use it as a cuteness tool to draw cleints Could you explain to your wife that you took on a responsibility to care for this animal and daycare can wait a few years?  I dunno, just trying to help ya think. Gotta be a way to keep him in your family"
517694,chuckymcd,2010-11-05 14:28:00,144,"i could never do this, no matter what the wife wanted to do.  good luck bud "
517734,bbog,2010-11-05 16:14:00,665,"As an avid dog lover and rescue volunteer I was quite saddened to read of your plight until I got to the part that said ""will take the best offer"". This is a self proclaimed ""family member"" not a used car. Sure you have an investment in her as she has an investment in you (and the rest of the family). But she has no options and depends entirely on you to look out for her best interests. That's the deal when you take on the responsibility to share your life with a dog.  Blaque has provided many good ideas to keep her in the family. If none of these are feasible then your first priority is to find the best possible solution for her - not you. Cash is not a part of this equation."
517742,uglyfish,2010-11-05 16:45:00,981,"Maybe the ""best offer"" he is looking for, does not involve cash, but is the offer from someone else to give his dog a good home, room to play and be loved just as much as he loved her..."
517743,stubbex1,2010-11-05 16:47:00,164, my guess as well..........
517746,laszlo,2010-11-05 16:52:00,487," If the best offer is 0 dollars, that's fine. I want her to go to a happy family environment where she can run daily and be completely content. She won't just be going to anyone who offers me money. Like a breeder we will be interviewing possible owners. So far two OFNer's have offered to take her for free and that may end up being the case if the situation is right.  Thanks for the advice and assuming I'm a complete idiot though."
517747,bbog,2010-11-05 16:52:00,665,I certainly hope I got it wrong.
517844,ADB,2010-11-05 21:13:00,444, My thoughts exactly.  But I guess Laz has already considered all of his options and this is what it came down to.
517854,Chance,2010-11-05 21:57:00,420,"you have a PM Laz,might have a home for your girl."
517902,laszlo,2010-11-06 00:48:00,487,Ida has 95% found a new home up in Temagami with great people in an ideal situation. Thanks for the help guys!  If anything changes I'll post here.  Oh and Barnie...the deal was for a huge sum of 0 bucks.
517919,GBW,2010-11-06 01:27:00,8460,"like i said, read the pm i sent if this doesn't work out.  foster care (here) while you find the best place and so that you can visit her may be an option.  depending on the doggy play-date, if needed."
517947,pikehunter,2010-11-06 03:07:00,1659,"Was thinking the same thing as Blaque: Worth a try. You have to remember one thing about business, You can't make everyone happy you find a nitch unfulfilled and work on that. This may be yours.  Good luck with the new business."
517963,highdrifter,2010-11-06 05:02:00,2534,"Say it ain't so brother...  Ida's a good pup, just like her best friend.  I wish you all the best."
