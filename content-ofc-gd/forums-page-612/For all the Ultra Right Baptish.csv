With high degree of emphasis he said,   'If I had all the beer in the world, I'd take it and pour it into the river!'   Then with even more emphasis he said,  And if I had all the wine in the world, I'd take it and pour it into the river!'  Then, pounding his fist on the pulpit with even greater emphasis he said,   'And if I had all the whiskey in the world, I'd take it and pour it into the river!'   And then finally, with a look of deep earnest and his eyes flashing,  in a hoarse whisper he said,   'And believe me brethen, if I had all the jaded women in the world, I'd take them to the river and throw them in too!'   With his sermon completed, he sat down..  Then song leader stood up and very cautiously announced with a coy smile, nearly laughingly,   'For our closing song, Let us sing Hymn #365,  'Shall We Gather at the River.'  Smile, life is too short not to!  See you at the river!"
