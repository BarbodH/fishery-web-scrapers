515010,Handlebarz,2010-10-26 19:20:00,3790,Great report for sure what a amazing bunch of fish congratz.
515019,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-10-26 19:40:00,0,"Man! What I wouldn't do to catch a big sheephead like that! Too bad you didn't film that sheephead battle! You must of thought you had the mother of all pickerel on!!!LOL Still, one for the record books! Umm I think your fishfinder is broken. There are all kinds of scratches on the screen."
515094,vinnimon,2010-10-27 00:58:00,2593,Congrats aaron on the record breaker!
515099,Gerritt,2010-10-27 01:13:00,6129,I can sum this up in one word.. Baaaaaaaaaaah!
515152,Moosebunk,2010-10-27 06:12:00,3970,"The fight went...  Aaron takes a port side rod which goes screaming.... the fish ends up back at 660 last we know of it before Tony takes another rod that fires starboard.  I'm eating some delish Fondue and passing gas, but am forced to clear three lines.  Tony lands his sheepie...    ... then we clear the last line, enjoy some more delish Fondue and a Black Forest cake from Timmies, and pop the boat in neutral to wait for ole Aaron to quit showboating.  Aaron's fish is staying down but finally it surfaces like a whale, spits out a 36-inch muskie and is in the net.  The rest becomes his official (between us all and those who matter) Ontario record.  The End.         Ahhhhhh it was a blast sharing the boat with these two yahoos.  Great BOQ weekend, the way they should always happen.  Thanks again doods, was a fun time full of fish."
515153,solopaddler,2010-10-27 08:40:00,8605,That sheephead is just ridiculous! Crazy big
515166,superdad,2010-10-27 11:48:00,353,Aaron  Great report - Thanks for sharing your info with all.  That was a Monster sheepie - Holy Cow - bet you thought you have the 20lb eye
515175,mepps,2010-10-27 12:55:00,1301,Awesome stuff!
515222,fishnsled,2010-10-27 16:34:00,3520,Great report but could have used a couple more pics.
515345,msp,2010-10-27 23:33:00,1336,"Good work on the eyes. The dynamic trio eh. Thanks for the report and congratulations on that ""other "" fish"
516420,bassnass,2010-10-31 20:38:00,174,Pure awesome.  Cannot get over that sheephead!  Unreal!
516425,muskymatt,2010-10-31 21:01:00,2608,Beauty report and holy crap that shead is freaking huge!!  Sweet pics as well..good read!
517014,bassnass,2010-11-03 00:23:00,174,Question:  In with the other fish - is that a pic of a cisco? Or what...
517143,tonyb,2010-11-03 15:38:00,1637,"Thanks for putting up the pics and write-up Aaron and Bunk, also thanks for all the comments guys.  It was a great time and I can't add much more than what has already been said, good fishing, good laughs and great company.  The Bay never seems to dissapoint and this year was no exception as we seemed to be able to figure them out a bit more each day after our slower start on Thursday, and by Saturday we for sure had them dialed in and the winds were co-operative.  LincolnG, you're correct that is in fact a Cisco aka Lake Herring.  It struck a Mooselook wobbler on a 5-colour leadcore setup...of all things! hehe  That particular setup accounted for 4 different species of fish for us, Walleye, Drum, White Bass and the Cisco.    The colour of the spoon is called Candy Apple Green...but I affectionately renamed it 'the green monster'  Tight lines, Tony"
517284,bassnass,2010-11-04 00:32:00,174,Thanks dude - MONSTER Perch btw - noice!  Interesting how the spoon pulled such a mixed bag.  You think that running snap wts instead of leadcore would rock that presentation as well?
517377,tonyb,2010-11-04 13:45:00,1637,"  I don't see why it wouldn't.  However, I don't run snap weights at all for trolling, I probably should pick up a set to see how they fish alongside leadcore or copper in certain scenarios.  It could mean the difference between catching a few or a dozen  That being said, Leadcore does add a certain property to the presentation of lures, especially spoons, with the minor rise and fall undulations through the water column.  I have tried the dive bomb diving weights but it's just another component to remove from the line, as snap-weights are, when brining a fish in.  Since I use in-line planer boards exclusively on my boat, that is already one thing to remove from the line, and the dive bomb or snap weight would be a second thing to handle.  We all know what can happen when there are split second pauses in a battle with a fish, so trying to minimize that is key to getting more fish in the boat  Oh and thanks for the comment on the Perch, that was from Lake Simcoe last fall, my best day Perch fishing ever (and it was captured on film for Aaron's show last season!).  The day before that, I had my best day Steelheading ever (a fish every few drifts day!)...a fishy weekend that won't be soon forgotten"
519503,Rod Caster,2010-11-12 22:42:00,5784,I'm bringing this one out of the wood works. I must have viewed these photos twenty times. That's an incredible fish Aaron!!!!      
514840,Aaron Shirley,2010-10-26 02:14:00,655,"I fished for 3 days on the Bay of Quinte in the reach trolling for walleye with TonyB and the Bunkster (Bunk joined us for 2 days). It was a great time with our group of Buddies, lots of fish, food, fish fry, wings, cold beer, laughs and great company, on and off the water.  Tony and I had a tough day Thursday, and eliminated a bunch of unproductive water in pretty rough seas, not to mention cold! We ended up with a handful of fish and a place to start for Friday. We didn`t get a start until 11:30am.  Bunk joined us Friday and we had a better day, but still a bit slow while we were in search mode. We slowly got into our Quinte groove and by the end of the day we figured out a productive pattern. It was really rough and cold on Friday as well. We got a bit of an earlier start at about 9:30am.  Saturday was THE day for us. No messing around, as the weather was awesome! We got a start at daybreak and executed our program on productive water right away.  It was non-stop action throughout the day, and we all worked well as a team. The tally for the day was 36 bites. I believe 14 walleye in the boat, 5 lost, a white bass and the rest drum... including a tank of a drum that I caught at 27.5 pounds! It was a memorable day on the water with great company.  Bunk got a PB walleye at 11.25 pounds, and I got a PB sheepie at 27.5 pounds  A bunch of double headers and a triple header throughout the day made things interesting as well.  Riggers and Dipsys were cold for us, it was all boards with braid and 3 & 5 leadcore with a variety of diving stickbaits and a green Mooselook spoon. Typical sppeds between 1.7 to 2.1mph worked well.  Thanks for the awesome weekend boys!  No shortage of photos from different angles of the adventure weekend, enjoy.                                                                          Good fishing!  Aaron"

514854,mercman,2010-10-26 02:32:00,7054, the drum is a once in a lifetime fish. Musta fought like crazy. The walleye are some beautiful  fish. Fantastic colors. congrats all around.
514855,Nipfisher,2010-10-26 02:32:00,2449,Huge Sheepie. Some nice eyes too.  Not trying to hyjack the thread but can someone explain to me why 3 fisherman can have 6 lines in the water? I see it with the charters as well. Thanks.
514857,irishfield,2010-10-26 02:35:00,26272,2 lines per angler on Lake Ontario... you just have to be past the Adolphous Reach ferry to do so..
514859,Joey,2010-10-26 02:37:00,9122,"Sweet report, can't wait to get out there myself in November  Joey"

514891,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-10-26 10:35:00,0,i love the fall BOQ posts.
514894,solopaddler,2010-10-26 10:51:00,8605,"MEH, personally I don't see the attraction of reeling in what amounts to a drift sock.  (at least this time of year).  But I have to admit that looked like a lot of fun and the company was even better.  Nice shootin' boys, well done."
514907,cityfisher,2010-10-26 12:37:00,959,great post as always Aaron !
514909,oldphart,2010-10-26 12:52:00,665,"~~~~~Okay Okay enough is enough. Honey I'm headed to BOQ, what shut up and get to work, but honey the Eyes are running. What you'll do what well okay. Sorry guys I won't be rushing down there Today but come Sat. what's the weather going to be. ~~dam those were nice phish"
514914,johnnyb,2010-10-26 13:16:00,3413,Oh mannnnnn why didn't we head out to deeper water on Saturday?>!?!?  Nicely done boys....very very nicely done!  We busted out the planers....lead core...even spoons.....but we never headed to the deep stuff.  Sigh.  Next time....but for now....I'll live vicariously through your post   :D  
514919,jimmer,2010-10-26 13:28:00,2730,"Great report and success.  Like johnnyb, a buddy and I spent Wednesday and Thursday last week fishing between Deseronto and Hay bay with nothing to show. There were fish in that area, but wouldn't hit anything we threw at them.  We were thinking of heading down to the Picton area, which now I see we should have done."
514926,Rod Caster,2010-10-26 13:49:00,5784,Top notch guys! You could have made several nice purses from that leathery guy.
514998,mike rousseau,2010-10-26 18:23:00,4661,i guess i made a rookie mistake following most of the pack on saturday...  with 20 boats following the same line i didnt even think to break to deeper water...nice catch...thanks for the report ... its nice to know i got my butt kicked ... that way i know it was me and not the fishing... i'll have to try harder next time i guesss... we finished with one landed one lost and one strike in a small area in the reach...
515004,corvette1,2010-10-26 19:10:00,1765,nice eyes congrats
