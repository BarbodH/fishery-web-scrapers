We were shore fishing and the fishing was extremely slow, and I decided to try out another spot, and after nailing 'em it was overrun and shoulder to shoulder fishing ensued. As you can imagine, the amount of crossing over was the suck. Still came out with the biggest one and the most though. Couple of amazingly super high quality phone pictures:    ~30, let a huge amount go    goliath of the day"
