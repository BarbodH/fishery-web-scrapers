519806,splashhopper,2010-11-14 04:26:00,2931,"Dutchy and I got out for the day for some perching with another friend.  They BOTH kicked my butt in quantity and quality of fish.  But on the bright side, I FOUND my Fuji waterproof camera. Yep, in the inner pocket of my WINTER COAT !  The battery was dead. I am itching to know where the last pics I took are from.  Here is the fish that I got to bring home. ( i only caught half of them   )     When they hit the frying pan tomorrow, they will taste just like the ones I usually catch ALL BY MYSELF"
