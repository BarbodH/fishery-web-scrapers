However, I can't be the ONLY ONE who suspects others in the house may be watching OFC for some Christmas ideas for their significant other ( ME ! ) or some gift ideas to give to our other fishing family members.  So, in no particular order, here are my top three:  1) Depth finder with temperature and side view capabilities  2) Mr Buddy Heater  3) Ice fishing jigs    Now, how about all you OFC'ers?  What are the top three items you hope for for Christmas this year ?"
