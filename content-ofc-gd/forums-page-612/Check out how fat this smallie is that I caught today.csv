519973,aniceguy,2010-11-14 23:27:00,1094,where else can you fish and in no time get wings beer and suicide wings from a hooters gal
520026,Cudz,2010-11-15 01:27:00,2652,There are smallies in the bay for sure.  There is neither the numbers or the size as there is in the fall. I fish the bay in the summer and I do catch smallies but they are not the same.
520076,limeyangler,2010-11-15 04:02:00,5204,  Your a little bit good at this bass fishin' thing eh Chris?
520082,misfish,2010-11-15 11:17:00,29133," What do call numbers?  Yes they are putting the feed bag on now,but like I said,they are in the bay during the summer.I cant count the hours I put in going up and down bothsides of the bay weaving in and out to different depths,finding structures that you would never know were there if it wasnt for the weaving.  Hopfully I,ll have a boat I can fish out of next year. I miss the smallie action.  5.7 Nice fish."
520161,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-11-15 16:28:00,0,Very nice! It looks like a good 5 and a 1/2 pounder.

519735,Jigger,2010-11-13 23:55:00,1237,Yeah that was a big fish man. Even bigger in person! Hopefully a few more like that before the water hardens up!
519737,misfish,2010-11-13 23:58:00,29133,7.9 lbs.  
519738,MCTFisher9120,2010-11-14 00:03:00,3761,"great catch, did you weigh it?"
519739,Guest Manitoubass,2010-11-14 00:06:00,0,NICE!!!  Where and what weight/length?
519740,Cudz,2010-11-14 00:16:00,2652,yes I did. have a guess.  My scale might be messed up though.  Not sure.
519742,misfish,2010-11-14 00:22:00,29133, So 7.9 wasnt close?
519743,Cudz,2010-11-14 00:28:00,2652,I wish.  Let me put it this way.  I have caught bigger.
519745,Bondar,2010-11-14 00:29:00,817,"6,8"
519746,Guest Manitoubass,2010-11-14 00:30:00,0,"Id say 6, an even 6, still a great smallie though"
519753,misfish,2010-11-14 00:57:00,29133, Thats a pig dude. Yer scale is off.
519783,splashhopper,2010-11-14 02:48:00,2931,
519801,Leecher,2010-11-14 04:14:00,7832,Awesome Chris Couple of chunky ones..... Congrats Leechman
519871,Rod Caster,2010-11-14 15:48:00,5784,She's gorgious! I'll say 6.1  
519892,misfish,2010-11-14 17:11:00,29133,OK OK what was it?  Did I see you out there this morning again?
519895,Familyfisherman,2010-11-14 17:19:00,188,How deep were you finding them?  We've done well in 35-45fow...do you have any idea why they seem to come into that area?  We haven't seen a tonne of baitfish...is it the crayfish?  Just wondering what the biology is as to why they come into those areas this time of year...obviously they winter there...but why there?  Any advice is appreciated. Thanks.  PS -- great fish!
519910,misfish,2010-11-14 18:25:00,29133,"  Im prety sure it due to the old Merc/gm tourneys that were held in Barrie. Also the CFT. Fish were released after weighins in the bay. The later tourneys, the release boat was used to transfer them into different areas of the lake. There were years that 1.5 -2 pound smallies were schooled as thick as the perch are now. I did see some boats this morning, out in the depth you mentioned."
519947,Cudz,2010-11-14 21:18:00,2652,No way.  These fish have always come in here ( i think).  They follow the shiners in.  Lots of other fish too. These fish are not here in the summer.  Only the fall.
519948,Cudz,2010-11-14 21:19:00,2652,"By the way, it weighed 5.75 pounds.  I thought it was going to be 6 for sure but it came up short.  Still a good fish just not long enough I guess.  The one in my avatar is much longer."
519952,misfish,2010-11-14 21:48:00,29133," What do you mean, no way?????????  Not in the summer eh??????????   You need to look at the bay better."
