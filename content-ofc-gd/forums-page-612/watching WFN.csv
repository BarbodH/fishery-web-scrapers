It might be a stupid question and something I should recognize and or know about , I have no clue?  My inquiring mind wants to know.  Thanks gang!   Randy "
519663,danbouck,2010-11-13 18:57:00,4380,Forget what it's called but they go down into the bottom and act as an anchor

519670,Muskieman,2010-11-13 19:33:00,2472,"Thanks Guys!!  I guess that it would stop the boat from drifting around, opposite to being tied off the end of an anchor cord.... So you would be ""stapled"" to the bottom....  I could see myself using that for Pike.. but I'll make 'em out of Hardwood dowel.   Randy "
519673,kickingfrog,2010-11-13 19:49:00,8333,A lot of bass anglers are using them as well.
519677,spinnerbaitking,2010-11-13 20:11:00,1622,"Down south when the Bass are on the Beds & they're sight fishing, they would put the Power Pole down but they found in wind & waves they would pivot on the one pole so a some of the Tournament guys put 2 on & it holds them still, I think they have 6' & maybe 8' poles Richard http://www.foreandaf....com/pp-003.htm"
519691,Harrison,2010-11-13 21:13:00,2202,"Very popular now.  Great for fishing docks or other shoreline structure, especailly when fishing wind blown shorelines."

519707,Roy,2010-11-13 22:23:00,13728,A malfunction at 70mph would be interesting.
