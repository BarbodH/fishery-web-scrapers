The guys were successful last night as well, beautiful fat 17-19 inchers to boot, and I scored my season high 4 lb to live to see another day     apparently i know where the 10-12 pound monstrosities can be had (Where it stays open 'till Dec 31), but its a farish drive and its really really cold out"
519804,Leecher,2010-11-14 04:19:00,7832,Sounds like you've struck gold Congrats on your season high Kwan   Beauty for sure!!! Thanks for sharing Leechman
519870,Rod Caster,2010-11-14 15:47:00,5784,Nice Kwan..you're kicking butt out there. My suggestion...take the long drive and fish for the monsters.
519943,bigredfisher,2010-11-14 20:49:00,300,do they close tonight or last night????
