519598,Jewelbee,2010-11-13 04:44:00,422,Wow! Watch this slide show. http://www.edmontonsun.com/news/world/2010/11/07/16024401.html
519600,Stern Rules,2010-11-13 04:55:00,342,Well that was something to see. Thanks for sharing.
519683,misfish,2010-11-13 21:03:00,29133,"I have looked at this 4 times now. Yes the bear is chasing the bison,did the bear put the hurt attack on the bison? Did the Bison maybe encounter a pack of wolves which he/she escaped from, and the bear caught the scent of blood. The  bison is ripped   . To me it had to be wolves. The bear would of, IMO,taken him down before he hit the street. Watched many bear vs moose vids,and the bear has always won.     Cool pics. TFS"
519686,FisherMike,2010-11-13 21:07:00,108,"from what ive read, the bison was burned in a recent forest fire.  apparently the bison got away from the bear but was found and killed by conservation officers few days later."
519693,misfish,2010-11-13 21:18:00,29133,  I tend to disagree.The wounds are to fresh.   Dont always believe what you read.
519697,FisherMike,2010-11-13 21:47:00,108,from what the officers said in their report the animal was covered in burns and that is why they put it down.  google it.
519700,misfish,2010-11-13 22:07:00,29133,"Park rangers later found the bison and put it down due to injuries it received in earlier forest fires.  It,s May,forest is full of snow,,,,,,,,,,No fires.  It recieved in earlier fires?  I googled,,,,,,,,,,no fires,that I could find. Last one I found was 2008."
519702,FisherMike,2010-11-13 22:13:00,108,"there are fires in yellowstone every year.  anyway, i wasnt there, and i dont know the exact facts.  i thought the pictures were amazing so i looked em up on google.  im just stating what ive read online."
519706,misfish,2010-11-13 22:20:00,29133, Myself aswell.
519721,Joey,2010-11-13 23:03:00,9122,"If you read the comments, one guy says the bison was burned in a hot spring, not a fire.  Who knows what the real story is.  Amazing photos tho.  Joey"
519771,bare foot wader,2010-11-14 01:50:00,1354,"there's plenty of fires that never get attention and therefore no google info....doesn't look like damage from wolves so hot springs would make sense.....either way, don't agree with rangers euthanizing it, think they should've let nature take it's course...grizzly would've followed it for days and taken it down eventually"
519777,misfish,2010-11-14 02:24:00,29133, Mother nature takes care of her own.
519812,Dozer,2010-11-14 04:41:00,896,Like the bison allready had enough on his plate being burned and all... once you're weak its game over... tough life.
520146,torco,2010-11-15 16:00:00,656,I wonder what they did with it after they euthanized the animal?  I just saw a show on wolverines last night and it would have made a great meal for them.
520159,NBR,2010-11-15 16:27:00,163, If they put the bison down to end it's  misery and left it there some critters would have dined well.
