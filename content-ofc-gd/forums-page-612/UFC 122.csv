519758,DRIFTER_016,2010-11-14 01:23:00,10439," Yes, in 38 minutes."
519761,Nipfisher,2010-11-14 01:23:00,2449,ya it's on tonight. The Marquardt fight should be entertaining but the rest of the card is ho-hum.
519762,Twocoda,2010-11-14 01:24:00,4130,thanks guys ...means a change of plans...
519765,misfish,2010-11-14 01:28:00,29133," Oh it,s on"
519774,Terry,2010-11-14 02:01:00,14456,oh yeah
519782,Beats,2010-11-14 02:46:00,543,I watched this earlier today on digital cable from 3-6pm on Sportsnet HD. Its available in the afternoon here on the free ones because of the time difference.  Wasn't a bad one.  Can't ever really prejudge by the card.  A good fight is a good fight.  Lots of times its the relatively unknown guys.  Anything can happen in there.
519784,misfish,2010-11-14 02:52:00,29133,
519788,GBW,2010-11-14 03:21:00,8460,anyone know how Sean P. did?
519893,misfish,2010-11-14 17:13:00,29133,"He,s in 123.  I fell asleep,UFC needs to get better or like I said before,have 2 or 3 main shows a year."
519894,Terry,2010-11-14 17:18:00,14456,well it was a free one  I thought a couple of the fights were action packed   but I agree I think it's getting watered down..too many fights  hey it's just like the NHL......
519941,misfish,2010-11-14 20:38:00,29133,"  Pretty much,wonder why it,s boring aswell?"
519999,steverowbotham,2010-11-15 00:45:00,1800, He;s not fighting until December
520055,GBW,2010-11-15 02:25:00,8460,Thanks Brian and Steve.  I know he's in Mtl already so I wasn't sure.
520061,Twocoda,2010-11-15 02:46:00,4130,Dennis Silver fight was a great match ...very fast paced fight ...
520092,steverowbotham,2010-11-15 12:56:00,1800," It wasnt a super card by any means, but look at it like this...  Its a German event which is a country they are still trying to break into.... They lost the co-main event of the evening due to illness... and most of all, they were competing with Pacquiao-Margarito which would have beat them in PPV buys if GSP was on the card, so why waste the money.  It was free so we cant really complain, I thought there were some good fights.  And when you say the UFC needs to get better... they're merging with the WEC in January, 135 / 145 lbs fights added to the cards will ensure better fights guaranteed.  I've never been more excited for the sport... Look at the cards lined up for the new year so far... impressive... even the free Fight for the Troops event in January looks awesome!
