519417,Keenan,2010-11-12 16:48:00,59,Has anyone ever tried these? Wonder if they work good or are they a waste of money? Thanks in advance.  http://www.canadiantire.ca/AST/browse/5/SportsRec/Fishing/IceFishing/PRDOVR~0788167P/Electric%252BIce%252BDrill%252BAdapter.jsp?locale=en
519419,Guest gbfisher,2010-11-12 17:00:00,0,  If they were any good they'd stop building gas powered machines. Just my opinion. A hand auger works better and longer than any electric and when the ice gets thick...there's nothing like a gas powered auger to burn as many holes as you need. I average 30 holes each time out. That's only two people fishing. Bring 4 or 6 with you and you'll be happy you brought extra gas for the auger.
519420,GBW,2010-11-12 17:00:00,8460,"I have one, never used it.  My cousin made it..."
519434,Keenan,2010-11-12 18:07:00,59,"I don't drill enough holes in a day for the gas auger to pay for it self, thanks for your opinion and quick reply."
519435,Guest gbfisher,2010-11-12 18:19:00,0,  Buy a hand auger. You'll just burn your electric drill out or destroy the gears inside. Not made for toque like you'll need for the ice. Fin bore III makes a good drill.
519451,misfish,2010-11-12 19:16:00,29133,"HMMMMMMMMM I got an order to make an attachment yesturday.Sure hope it works for this guy,cause it cost him big,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,my time is expensive.  And Andy,those fin3 are sweet blades.Dought they would put much strain on a heavey duty cordless.You dont even have to put any pressure on those augers.They cut just by turning."
519454,bigugli,2010-11-12 19:32:00,6138,Had one.  Was good for the first few holes then I burnt my good drill out.   I know a few others that made the same mistake.
519466,Terry,2010-11-12 20:36:00,14456,"I have a old 18v drill I am going to try this year with a 6"" auger it's a 3 speed hammer drill    I think on slow speed it should get me good torque and do alright.....we will see"
519474,misfish,2010-11-12 21:10:00,29133,Ya gotz mail.
519483,misfish,2010-11-12 21:32:00,29133,"Customer is happy, so here it is. Im thinking I should of used a hex bar for the drill,this I may still do, as I have it still. 3/16 wall galvinized pipe.    Drill insert    Auger insert.     This customer payed in paso,s."
519485,Terry,2010-11-12 21:38:00,14456,looks good   now I will be able to drill more then 2 holes without taking a break   ok more then one hole without taking a break
519487,Guest gbfisher,2010-11-12 21:47:00,0,yer gonna wreck that three speed battery operated hammer drill Terry. Just maybe not on the first hole. Maybe the second..
519488,misfish,2010-11-12 21:51:00,29133,  I havent checked the mail yet.
519568,perchslayer666,2010-11-13 01:44:00,280,"The drill auger is a good concept, but a bad idea if you want to drill more than 20 holes a season. When your out on the ice, the last thing you want is one of your essential tools (Auger, heater, rod/reel slush scooper, portable hut, ect....) To fail.  Do your self a favor, don't waste your time with this idea, and buy either a new or used gas auger which will be dependale, and get the job done when needed the most.  Although not a problem with me, some guys don't like it if you come ice fishing, ill prepared and have to resort to asking for a couple holes to be drilled."
519569,Terry,2010-11-13 01:51:00,14456,"I have 2 gas augers and a hand auger that I can switch back and forth from hand to drill in about 20 seconds and the adapter was made for me and I am going to give it a try, then I can say whether or not it works..... it's for perch fishing early season  an I have an real good battery drill to try with not a CTC piece of crap"
519570,irishfield,2010-11-13 01:53:00,26272,"..and if that fails,,, he grabs my 2HP Jiffy Lightning! lmao"
519571,Terry,2010-11-13 01:54:00,14456,"well ....we all grab it  light ,,,fast,,,,,and runs great"
519588,HTHM,2010-11-13 03:25:00,4082,JOSE can you see???
519615,canadadude,2010-11-13 12:12:00,769,"I've only seen these work good once,the guy had a high end Dewalt industrial drill that costs $350+....even then it was good for about 10 holes before a battery change was needed.That was in a about 12"" of ice, my old model 30 was poping holes twice as fast."
519621,gaspumper,2010-11-13 13:32:00,393,I have used one for 3 years on a 18volt mastercraft drill.Have two batteries You have to keep them warm when not in use or the cold weather will kill them
519624,Jer,2010-11-13 13:40:00,1426,"I had an adapter made up at a machine shop last year.  It worked alright until the ice got over 12"". Once the ice was 20""+, we were lucky to get two holes drilled per battery on an 18V Craftsman drill.  I just picked up a gas auger at Costco yesterday...no more worries."
519630,Keenan,2010-11-13 14:50:00,59,"Thanks for the reply's guys, I think im just going to stick with my hand auger as I don't want to wreck my drill, thanks for the imput. Tight lines. Keenan."
519633,skeeter,2010-11-13 15:29:00,1907,"Every auger has its good points and bad. hand augers are great, when the blades are sharp. gas augers are great when the blades are sharp and the auger runs...lol Like Tracker say's- here dann, start this thing cause i cant find where the key goes in.LOL"
519658,Tybo,2010-11-13 18:39:00,1373,I have a dewalt drill I been using at work for 15 years.I only drill steel with it. IT has drill holds in 8 inches of steel and up too 4 inch hole. The first thing I did was replace the key-less chuck for a keyed one. This highly reduces chuck slippage.Slippage is what kills drills.
