On the up-side, Averie and I managed to sneak out for an hour while Mom and Luke were having an afternoon nap... here's a photo report of our day....  Went outside with the dogs for their morning run.... talk about vicious   and took a few minutes to enjoy a frosty morning...   The farmer behind us still hasn't picked his corn...       found these... mole hills?   Dogs wore themselves out so in we went...   Ran to town and got all kinds of fun stuff like diapers and food.. lol then did house and yard chores until Averie and I snuck out for some shore action...  tried the pier in Rowan first.. nadda      so we peaced out...   then we hit up long point and caught all kinds of dink fish but had some fun...  double hold.. lol   my giant..   caught a bunch of these...   even got a few double headers..   Eventually the kid got cold hands so we called it a day, had supper and lit our Christmas lights.... albeit a little early! "

And thanks for the heads up on my inbox - I wondered what was up with the sudden shortage of messages! lol      Thanks Harrison!  Have a great week folks!  Ryan"
520115,Harrison,2010-11-15 14:05:00,2202," I tried to send this via PM but said I couldn't. Not trying to spam just thought this T-shirt from us would be a cute fit for this thread.  My 4 yr old perch princess schools me all the time, she gave me the idea for the shirt.  "
520119,asdve23rveavwa,2010-11-15 14:28:00,2690,"Some really nice shots, Ryan!!  Another couple of years and Averie will be ready for a show of her own!!  Look out, Dave!!!!!!!!!"
