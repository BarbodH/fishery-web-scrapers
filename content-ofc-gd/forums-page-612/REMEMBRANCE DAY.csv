519142,skeeter,2010-11-11 13:48:00,1907,"Remembrance day here in our house will not be forgotten! My son Daniel joined the sea cadets 3 years ago. He is now a Master Seaman. His commanding officers realize his devotion and determination to further his carrier in the armed forces. He has been to the base in Kingston for training and next march he will be flown out to BC for further training. In 2012 he will be able to enlist in the armed forces full time. It is hard for a parent to accept a decision like this from their child, but we have accepted it and stand behind him 100%. We are very proud of him, and we will be there for him every step of the way.      "
519147,lew,2010-11-11 13:55:00,12766,I was also in RCSCC Scarborough many many years ago and then went into the Navy.  Your son is making an excellent choice and it's a decision he'll be happy he made for the rest of his life.

A a teen, cadets opened the door to several exciting opportunities. If your son is doing the leadership course out of Quadra he will have a great and rewarding experience."
