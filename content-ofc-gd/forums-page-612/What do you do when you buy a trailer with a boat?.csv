519577,Pigeontroller,2010-11-13 02:11:00,2793,You'll have to go to the local MTo office and get a plate for it...
519582,HTHM,2010-11-13 02:52:00,4082,Hope that FishnAutographs pulls you over....
519583,Joey,2010-11-13 03:03:00,9122,"You can go and get a temporary plate at the MTO, or borrow the owners plate and then take it back to him after you get your boat home (or mail it to him).  Joey"
519585,fishing n autograph,2010-11-13 03:10:00,2540, i don't think that he would want that
519586,fishing n autograph,2010-11-13 03:11:00,2540,"same as buying a used car. keep the owners plates on it, drive to the mto and do the paperwork"
519587,HTHM,2010-11-13 03:19:00,4082,Do you work for YRPS? If so you have a nice facility coming in Aurora. I am involved in a small way in the project.
519589,fishing n autograph,2010-11-13 03:39:00,2540,yup and we're patiently waiting.....only problem is that the building is now being rushed and the move in date is pushed back yet again
519632,BFSC Kevin,2010-11-13 15:23:00,1351,"  Ahh... That works! Previous times when I bought a boat, the owners gave me the plate too. lol.  thanks all"
