396114,Razovy,2009-10-25 01:43:00,2,"4 rods? It’s nothing!  Last week I was fishing Pasific and cought grey whale. Not too big – just about 40 tonnes. This animal broke 24 rods, 16 masts, 7 teeth, and downed 3 ships but finally got tired so I was able to bring him inside my Zodiac.  Unfortunately I can’t show the picture because picture itself weighs 12 pounds."
396169,Guest Johnny Bass,2009-10-25 13:41:00,0, LMAO!!!Honestly? This was really funny. But he did post pics on page 2. Anyways thanks for the laugh.
396246,steverowbotham,2009-10-25 19:29:00,1800,"I was fishing a tourney on Sparrow when this fish was caught and had the opportunity to see and hold the beast! It was weighed on an old spring scale that bottomed out at 50lbs.  My digital scale read 42lbs 7oz and our clubs weigh scale weighed it at 42.30lbs.  The fish was caught by a musky fisherman, yes he was targetting them.  It didnt die accidentally, he kept it on purpose.  Yes, he is 100% within his legal rights to keep this fish.  Unfortunate, yes.  but good for him, its being mounted, fish of a lifetime.  A fish like that has donated to the gene pool MANY times I would think.  My concern came when this angler told us he caught and kept another 53 incher out of there a few weeks prior.  That's when I became upset with the situation.  To keep a 53 inch trophy is fine by me.  I'd prefer a replica but to each his own.  But keeping 2 fish in the 50 inch class in 2 weeks time is not cool by me.  just my opinion.  Here's a pic I got with the giant!  "
396265,Guest gbfisher,2009-10-25 20:55:00,0,"from a 54"" 50 plus pounder to a 53"" 42lb and people wonder about the story behind the fish....  Nice fish. Im guessing Sparrow has been added to a few lists..."
396266,PAZE,2009-10-25 21:06:00,132,"Well its just an other lake that will get pounded to no end, I love the internet.  Paul"
396278,steverowbotham,2009-10-25 23:03:00,1800, There's a reason I didnt start a topic on it as soon as I got home that day haha
396280,glen,2009-10-25 23:15:00,2641,Thanks for adding the update to this story Steve.  Sad story though and i dont know why he would mount them.
400700,F_ast,2009-11-09 19:09:00,154,"I know, once upon a time Sparrow was a great muskie fishing lake, but at least a few years ago it had gone way down hill with all the fishing pressure and over abundance of pike.  It is good to still see fish coming out of there like this, but why keep them all the time?  Typically, these muskie are a Simcoe strain (yes i know there arnt muskie left in Simcoe) not really G bay strain and definetly not kawartha strain, but these fish tend to cruise the upper Trent from Sparrow, Glouster and out to Gbay.  But both are fantastic fish.  Definetly have not seen a muskie that big out of Sparrow in a while though."
400753,siwash,2009-11-09 22:26:00,683,That looks like a good eater...
400811,ozaibak1,2009-11-10 01:19:00,401,"Luckily we have over 250,000 lakes in Ontario, I doubt this post will have a significant impact on Sparrow Lake, at least what wasn't coming to it anyways."
519593,flash67,2010-11-13 03:59:00,28,That fish is insane!!!  Just to the right of the 2nd pic is where my cottage is located!!!  The white gas tank is Lauderdale Point Marina.  I've NEVER seen a SKI that big my lake before...  Sparrow lake is awesome but there is a lot of boat traffic now which sucks.   Its nice to see our lake pumpin out beauties like that though.
519602,brifishrgy,2010-11-13 05:01:00,559," It is a monster for sure, if he did keep one a few weeks earlier I would hope his freezer doesnt contain the other fish, would be a shame for him to get charged with being over the limit"
519603,irishfield,2010-11-13 05:03:00,26272,"LOL.. it's always made me wonder.. you put one on the wall, are you ever allowed to possess another one??"
519604,brifishrgy,2010-11-13 05:12:00,559," yup, once its on the wall its a trophy not a fish but to possess 2 that havent been ""finished"" is a whole different story"
519606,OhioFisherman,2010-11-13 06:11:00,6623,"Big fish, sad it couldn`t be released, but oh well.  ""What a massive musky!!!!!I wonder what it was feeding on."" LOL Johnny, anything that got too close? One time we went to the Georgian Bay, a bunch of guys were leaving that had been fishing for bass and had kept some. One was torn up, cuts down both sides from teeth, a decent fish 19-20 inches. I asked him what had happened to that one, a ski grabbed it as he was bringing it in, a huge fish that let go when it saw the boat."
519608,perchslayer666,2010-11-13 07:33:00,280,My god.... What a beast!!!!!! A wall hanger for sure!!!!!  That fish must have spawned many times over - no need to worry about keeping it... Lots of little skis swimming around there with its genes....  That's freaking huge! I would have kept it too - a life time worth of stories there.  A once in a life time catch for sure.
519610,Whitemikeca,2010-11-13 10:19:00,138,"Wow! Fish of a lifetime for sure!  It's a shame the angler keep two 50"" class fish.  Regardless if they were legal size or not that's selfish if you ask me."
394742,Jet,2009-10-20 14:06:00,364,That's gonna look great on the wall!
394750,anders,2009-10-20 14:24:00,1168,"Nice fish...congrats to the anglers...to bad about it dieing though, that stuff happens...still a great catch, definitly one to remember!  Maybe those guys will be able to tell us what Muskie actually tastes likes now"
394751,johnnyb,2009-10-20 14:26:00,3413,"very nice fish...gotta be one of the biggest to come from Sparrow in a long time, methinks"
394757,Dusky,2009-10-20 14:48:00,310,Thats one monster fish!! I dont mind losing four rods for a catch like this:)
394758,Carp,2009-10-20 14:48:00,1488,"Dangled my feet off the dock at Sparrow Lake for many summers as a kid. I've caught small muskie in Sparrow, but nothing even close to this beast. AWESOME !!!"
394781,kickingfrog,2009-10-20 16:57:00,8333,"The silence from some of the early post bashers is deafening, isn't it?  Nice fish."
394786,Mattitude,2009-10-20 17:06:00,155, LOL!  I do believe that someone basically called me a liar!  All I had to do was get permission to post the pics.  You all knew I wouldn't let you down.
394788,GBW,2009-10-20 17:12:00,8460,"I just thought I had my sound off as I sure didn't hear anything...  Nope, I didn't doubt it as you stated right away that you were asking for permission to post the pic's so I knew it was the real deal.  I can just see it now, how many posts are going to be edited, gusses?  LOL!"
394791,Toronto_Angler,2009-10-20 17:20:00,698,Lol I was just waiting for the pics and to see if anyone was going to post a retraction who called you a liar.  Nice fish!
394794,Matt15,2009-10-20 17:25:00,107,Now thats one heck of a trophy fish
394801,tightline,2009-10-20 17:46:00,322,WOW what a monster!!!!!! I fish Sparrow all the time been going there for walleye opener for some 7 years now and have caught a few Musky there none of this magnitude...Too bad it never made it back in but I'm sure it was not intentional...nevermind these guys bashing your story most of them have nothing better to do...they've probablly never caught anything worth posting and therefore feel the need to up-play the fact it didn't survive...great story too bad about the rods but them you can get everyday not everyday you get a fish of that quality...
394802,ChrisK,2009-10-20 17:53:00,2772,"Matt, Thanx for going ahead and posting those pics. Great fish and many stories to tell the grand children while admiring it on the wall  Cheers !!"

394827,Leecher,2009-10-20 19:06:00,7832,Congratulations to the angler who caught it That is a massive brute Thanks for posting the pics Matt!!! Leechman
394828,ehg,2009-10-20 19:08:00,2666, Exactly what i was thinking. There must be a few like that somewhere in L. Simcoe.  That is a huge muskie!
394844,mrdylan,2009-10-20 20:36:00,111,Wow what a nice fish.
394867,Rizzo,2009-10-20 21:25:00,4754, something called the marine railway might have something to say about that
394881,johnnyb,2009-10-20 22:11:00,3413,well...they DO like to swim in the prop wash....maybe one followed REAL close
394892,Whitespinnerbait,2009-10-20 22:44:00,2038,Yep ....   Serious Muskie right there....
394901,ctdd2006,2009-10-20 23:13:00,531,  .....hmm!  Congrats to the angler!  Anyone seen Ultyman???
394906,jaydub,2009-10-20 23:23:00,145,"Wow, very nice Musky!  Congrates to the guy who reeled that baby in  I'm sure he didn't care about the rods after that."
395214,fishingisliving,2009-10-21 22:39:00,170,Well if the rods were loomis i would cry..  :-)
395216,richyb,2009-10-21 22:57:00,774,HUGE FISH !   A few years ago I had my hut on sparrow and kept seeing a massive muskie. ( maybe not quite that big ) It had a big white scar on its back so we named him SCAR BACK. Seen it swim through my hole a dozen times or so with his back right against the ice. Doesnt surprise me a fish that big in there.
394536,Kerry,2009-10-19 23:18:00,383,Sparrow may well be a small cottage type lake but it is part of the severn river system and that level alone has miles of water that can easily grow bad boys to that size.Next time you are in Port Stanton take a look at the mount in the general store by the big dock.It came from straight out front.It was a small one according to the original store owner who got it from the fella who caught it years ago. Kerry
394545,NAW,2009-10-19 23:38:00,4022,I cought my first and only Ski on Sparrow this spring.  When does that lake turn over?
394550,fishindude,2009-10-19 23:48:00,220,In for pics
394556,misfish,2009-10-20 00:07:00,29133,Easy there fellas. Matt doesnt Bull.  Looking forward to seeing the pics Matt.
394604,Dozer,2009-10-20 02:04:00,896,"42 pound 'ski... real story, friend fished the tourney."
394614,Guest Johnny Bass,2009-10-20 02:31:00,0,I automatically figured that the fish broke the four rods thrashing in the boat. I've seen big Musky there.Its more than believeable. No wonder Sparrow lake is a tough lake. With big musky like that swimming around. I'd like to see the pic.
394631,Mattitude,2009-10-20 03:15:00,155,And here we go.  Looks big to me.     
394632,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-10-20 03:17:00,0,what a monster!  that's just an unreal fish.  too bad they couldn't have released it...
394634,wuchikubo,2009-10-20 03:20:00,1114,"Very nice Matt, congrats on the very nice 'ski."
394636,backbay,2009-10-20 03:22:00,773,"Big friggin' fish: too bad it didn't live, absolutely, but wow! Keeping it for a skin mount, I hope!"
394638,bassman87,2009-10-20 03:36:00,586,only worth 3 rods imo
394639,GBW,2009-10-20 03:36:00,8460,"Wow, huge fish for sure."
394641,mojobass,2009-10-20 03:41:00,34,"That is a monster fish, don't whoever bashed him feel just a little bad now? Haha. Even if it didn't break 4 four rods, he sure wasn't lying about it being heavy."
394647,discophish,2009-10-20 04:05:00,392,"That thing would have hauled me into the water and had me for breakfast!  Dang thing would have put my cigarette out too!  Hmmm, wait a sec, that's a toss up."
394648,jnic,2009-10-20 04:12:00,158,"that is one huge musky, it is worth ten rods in my books."
394682,Guest Johnny Bass,2009-10-20 11:33:00,0,"What a massive musky!!!!!I wonder what it was feeding on. I know the world record Musky caught was full of catfish. Since he kept it, I'd be curious to see what is in its stomach."

394690,bucktail,2009-10-20 11:59:00,1857,"Awesome fish!! One thing I noticed is that this isnt a kawaratha muskie, it has that georgian bay shape and colour to it. I wonder if it came up the lock system. Love the picture with the kid.....its the same size as him!!!!!!!  LOL"

394692,TC1OZ,2009-10-20 12:04:00,987,Thats HUGE! I hate the teaser posts!!! I waited for pictures to post hahaha!

394711,I'mHooked,2009-10-20 12:52:00,525,Were they using Shihtzu's or Chihuahua's for bait?  I wouldn't let any pets smaller than a German Sheppard swim in that lake!
394717,holdfast,2009-10-20 13:00:00,1813," LOL ,Yuk, I think if I had the money it would be a mounter for sure, hanging up somewhere in the Man Cave."

394404,Mattitude,2009-10-19 18:14:00,155,"Hey everyone.  I just recieved an e-mail from a friend of mine whos son helped a guy in Sparrow Lake this past saturday net a 54 inch 50 plus pound muskie.  The email is real, my friends son is in one of the pictures so I know its a real pic from around here.  Apparently it broke 4 rods and was kept only because it was to worn out after the battle (don't shoot the messenger)  I'm not sure if I can post the pics only because they aren't mine."
394406,[email protected],2009-10-19 18:18:00,290,How does 1 fish break 4 rods.... lololol...
394407,BillM,2009-10-19 18:18:00,17367,What a waste of a fish if it wasn't put back in the lake.
394408,fishingisliving,2009-10-19 18:23:00,170,cant wait to see the pictures.
394409,[email protected],2009-10-19 18:25:00,290,"  There won't be cause its a lie.  Read the story. 4 rods?  Did it break one,  cast out the line and hook it again,  Break one... repeat.. lol"
394410,Raf,2009-10-19 18:26:00,3495,maybe it had four marshmellows attached to it.  
394411,Mattitude,2009-10-19 18:26:00,155," From thrashing around in the boat is what it said.  Also it was tangled up in the net and took a while to get it free, which is why it was kept."
394412,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-10-19 18:27:00,0,4 rods! priceless!
394413,pike slayer,2009-10-19 18:33:00,1177, useless without pics! not to great of anglers to be breaking all those rods!! probably all walmart specials!
394414,Mattitude,2009-10-19 18:37:00,155,Read one post above you.  I'm gonna ask if I can post them.
394415,Roy,2009-10-19 18:38:00,13728,"It would need a girth of 28"" to weigh 50+ lbs. A pretty nice fish. Looking forward to seeing it."
394418,Guest gbfisher,2009-10-19 18:43:00,0,maybe the weight was actually the pile it left......
394423,leighfns,2009-10-19 18:53:00,103, Pics or Fail
394428,ChrisK,2009-10-19 19:00:00,2772,Wife and I broke one rod hauling a salmon into our 14ft Lund. She flopped it from the net right on top of my pole so breaking four on a big muskie I can understand. Looking forward to seeing it as Roy stated.....
394429,cram,2009-10-19 19:02:00,1733,I wouldn't post the pics.  You're only opening yourself (and your friend) up to scrutiny....which is really unfair if the person is just a recreational angler who lucked into a giant fish (whether 50 lbs or not).
394434,Terry,2009-10-19 19:13:00,14456,"MY GOD  read the post he said died, so they kept it, fish die, and that's a fact of fishing people need to start excepting  as soon as I read it I thought maybe the four broken rods were form the fish thrashing around in the boat many people who don't catch a lot of muskie are not equipped to handle them  and like most people they miss judge the size of the fish they have caught, they are fishermen and just caught a monster the excitement and lack of anything to compare it to, leads to over estimating   ......  I see no problem with questioning a post on things you don't understand or don't seem to make sense, but to just jump on it and accuse is a little much guys"
394435,fishermccann,2009-10-19 19:20:00,655,
394442,fishingisliving,2009-10-19 19:27:00,170,I consider myself vey lucky that none of my musky posts have never been bashed.... but maybe one of the future ones once the season is over will make people bash... :-)
394448,mbac31,2009-10-19 19:41:00,904,"The Fish was caught and for some reason died. Very well respected guys as well caught it. Did everything they could to revive it so the guy is going to mount it now. This stuff happens. Nothing wrong with that as far as I'm concerned.  42lbs 7oz, 53"" long. No need for fish tales on this one. I'm sure the guy will post if need be. Congrats to the guy who caught it."
394459,Mattitude,2009-10-19 20:02:00,155,Ok I'm having trouble posting a pic.  I have to take off for a bit but I will post one later if I can figure it out again
394460,BucktownAngler,2009-10-19 20:03:00,582,post some pics already.
394462,jediangler,2009-10-19 20:07:00,1923,You can use a hosting site like photobucket or myfishingpictures.com or resize it so it's under 250K and upload direct.
394463,ColdH20guy,2009-10-19 20:09:00,312,true story..smalliefisher is right...42lbs 7oz. We had our club classic tournament wrap-up that same day and we weighed it on our digital scales. I did see a couple of broken rods in the guys boat; girth I think was 24 inches. I took some pics with my cell phone...the only reason someone thought it was over 50 is they had an old hook style scale and it was pulling it close to 50..not very accurate with that thing so the digital was used.. thanks guys
394464,glen,2009-10-19 20:14:00,2641,Can you post some pics of this fish?
394532,holdfast,2009-10-19 23:05:00,1813,"Wow, is Sparrow Lake north of Barrie, a small cottage type lake?  Seems I might of passed it a few times along the Highway thinking it was fished out. Nice Musky though."
