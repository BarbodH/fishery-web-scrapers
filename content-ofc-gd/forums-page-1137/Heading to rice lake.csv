121350,Anatz,2007-10-07 08:31:00,74,My brother and I planned to go to Rice lake today and I was wondering if the weather conditions would affect the fishing. .I believe it's raining in Baliboro during the night until morning. Would this cause the water to become murky and muddy? I read about how bass move into deeper water since they don't like the muddy/murky water. Can someone explain how chocolate milk water happens?
121361,Clampet,2007-10-07 11:13:00,1947,Shallow (3-10 feet) water over a muddy bottom combined with a day or two of high winds = chocolate milk type water clarity.
