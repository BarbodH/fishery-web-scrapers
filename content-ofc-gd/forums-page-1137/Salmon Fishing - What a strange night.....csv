121138,ccmtcanada,2007-10-06 04:49:00,7971,"With the long weekend upon us, Bly and I decided to take the canoe out to hunt down some Salmon!  We launched at about 7pm...the waters were calm, no wind, comfortable temperatures.  We first started trolling some deep running cranks...then switched up to glow in the dark cleos.  My back doesn't agree a whole lot with casting from a canoe, so after a while, with no action whatsoever, we decide to take a break from casting, and I throw on a jig with a big juicy worm on it.  The idea was we'd drift around and see if we could catch anything...even a bullhead.  Problem was, after about 5 minutes, we realized we hadn't moved an inch....LOL...where the heck was the wind...or even a small current to take us along?  Oh well.  Suddenly, I get a huge hit....drag starts screaming from my spool.  I'm trying to control this beast, but it's putting up a good fight!!  Then I realize that althought the fight is good, this salmon hasn't come to surface to jump....I haven't really felt any head shakes.  Then I said...catching a salmon on worms?  Ok....could it be a walleye?  My heart starts thumping harder with the anticipation....  Then Bly nets this fish.....   As you can tell from the picture, I was completely ecstatic!!  This was better than a salmon....better than a walleye....I was just beside myself with happiness.  Ok...I like to catch carp...but not when I'm salmon fishing....LOL."

121152,wuchikubo,2007-10-06 08:05:00,1114,"Cliff, thanks for the funny faced post.  I was almost thinking you had caught that on a cleo until I finished reading the post."

121339,ccmtcanada,2007-10-07 04:11:00,7971,"Thanks all...Bly had no idea I made that face when she took that pic.  When she took a look to make sure the shot was ok, she just burst out laughing.  It was the first carp I've caught since June I think...looks like they are coming back shallow again in my area."
