120995,FISHINGNUT,2007-10-05 19:34:00,253,"Was in the water by 7:00am casted around the dam for a while saw alot of rainbows jumping .Hooked in to a pike on a jig ,cut the line no leader :roll:  trolled down to the ESSO sign one small lrg mouth ,and a  small EYE trolled some more with worm harness got a few more hits but they were just taking the worms couldn't get the hooks into anything.By now the sun was fully up and no cloud cover so we decided to fish the marina and shoreline docks for bass.Threw every colour senko at them with out a sniff tried tubes too without any luck.Decided to head home early and beat the traffic.It was a slow morning but the weather was great,saw alot of big bows and  watched 8 deer drinking from the river all in all it was a great day out just the fishing was a little slow."
121011,Guest Johnny Bass,2007-10-05 20:13:00,0,Thanks for the report. Always wanted to fish the grand for rainbows but just got too many other options.
121014,FISHINGNUT,2007-10-05 20:21:00,253,The average size bow we saw was  easily in the 10-12lbs range .We saw alot of guys down at the dam in Caledonia I assume they were fishing rainbows there as well
121054,fishindevil,2007-10-05 22:39:00,6254,Well hey you gave it a try right!!!!!!!   like i always say a bad day of fishing is still better than a good day at work...LOL..LOL. man that would be nice to hook a big rainbow ......better luck next time   cheers
121117,kennyman,2007-10-06 03:43:00,737,With that kind of luck it sounds like you had me with you LOL. Could've been worse. At least you hooked into a few.
121132,fatherof3,2007-10-06 04:09:00,1769,"at least you got out fishing,always a good day"
121193,Fishmaster,2007-10-06 14:11:00,920,Trolling for Eye's this time of the year in the river can be very tough ..most guys jig twisters around the dam area tipped with worms or shinners ...and most of the local guys that get fish pretty much everyday fish from 1pm to 5pm ...maybe try later in the day next trip and if your not getting snags your not getting walleye ...Fishmaster
