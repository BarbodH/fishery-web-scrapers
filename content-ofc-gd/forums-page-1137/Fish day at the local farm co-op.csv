Largemouth bass- 3 inch fish 1.75 each 6 inch fish 3.50 each 10-12 inch fish 10.00 each  Hybrid Bluegill- 3-5 inch fish 1.25 each  Adult Bluegill- 4-6 inch fish 1.50 each  Channel catfish- 4 inch fish 1.20 each 8 inch fish 1.50 each  Fathead minnows- 2 inch 8.50/lb  Hybrid white amur (grass carp) 11.00 each  Goldfish 6-8 inch 4.00 each  It cost some cash to stock a pond, a reason why some land owners don`t want people fishing their ponds. Numbers I have seen are a healthy pond will support 90 bass per surface acre, initial stocking done with a mix of sizes."
121234,sharper,2007-10-06 17:54:00,279,Is there a bass farm in ontario? I only know of a trout pond where you pay for the trouts you catch.
121249,Golfisher,2007-10-06 19:52:00,586, This is a lot more costly than I had ever thought.

121337,OhioFisherman,2007-10-07 04:00:00,6623,"Sharper, we have some private hatcheries here, they raise fish for stocking private ponds. They usually have a sale in the spring or in the fall at the farm co-op, if you have a farm co-op in your area they might know. At least one here advertises in our rural electric power magazine also.  I think the ones here truck the fish in to the store for the sale in trucks like the bait suppliers use. Usually just a one day sale, and ordering in advance guarantees you get what you want. The ad was in our local newspaper. Lots of farm ponds here."
