121628,douG,2007-10-08 18:48:00,2693,I'd prefer a Jumlaa in Egyptian Princess over that piece o crap.  That EP pattern rocks on BoQ.  And the interchangeable titanium lips are amazing.
121632,irishfield,2007-10-08 18:57:00,26272,I'm with Doug on the brand...but I always had a thing for Tammy Fay.........  Now if I'd lost that one Rick is showing in Grey Owl lake...I'd still be swimmin around up there lookin for it!

121722,Clampet,2007-10-08 23:30:00,1947," If you were to sell it, how much would you want?"
121725,Muskieman,2007-10-08 23:42:00,2472,I'll need two ... with my luck i'd lose it first cast..  ..ZZZZING
