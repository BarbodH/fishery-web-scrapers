It is for my hunting suit and got ripped while I was away on my moose hunt, need a patch to be at least 2-3"" square. Thanks Jay"
120915,bpsbassman,2007-10-05 17:18:00,941,"I got a patch kit when I was out West (outfitter at Lake Louise).  I know they don't have them at BPS, but I've been told that some of the local outdoor stores have them.  I was told to try that canoe/kayak place just off the QEW in the Mississauga area (sorry the name escapes me)."
120920,lew,2007-10-05 17:26:00,12767,"You may be able to get a kit from Mountain Equipment Co-Op in Toronto, and if not, they could probably tell you who'd have them.  Their at King & Spadina......416-340-2667  www.mec.ca"
120930,jedimaster,2007-10-05 17:43:00,3472,If you can actually access the gortex material from the inside you can just use a piece of tarp and marine goop. I did that on my Browning Scent lock pants. I ripped them deer hunting last year on a nail on the tree stand.
120933,Toronto_Angler,2007-10-05 17:46:00,698," Try giving a call to lebaron's, gagnon or mountain equipment co-op. They might have them."
120937,Jay T,2007-10-05 17:51:00,282,"Thanks guys, I will try all that have been suggested."
120939,Andy,2007-10-05 17:54:00,330,I found a patch for my rain jacket at a Fabricland store. I would look at fabric shops in your area. Andy

120959,Joey,2007-10-05 18:28:00,9122,WHAT!!! Gore-Tex isn't indestructible????   I thought for sure it was made of pike skin
121250,bassfighter,2007-10-06 20:06:00,366,"Try Shoe goo or Goop, the best glue you can use even on tennis shoe sole, after sticking it to a tennis shoe sole. I can play with it and it won't come off but still provide traction.so strong that I used it on filling a hole on my inflatable boat as well. My back pack strap broke, and instead of re-stitching it, I  just glued them on, it has been 5 years and after numerous times getting wet, it still holds. My boat cover also got torn , and I glued it with shoe Goo as well.   I recently punctured my waders and just Goop it and it is done."
