120709,Tarzan's Jane,2007-10-04 22:07:00,1183,"Just like the movies!  Seriously though, it could have been a disaster.  Excellent thinking on your part, the fact that you were aware of your fellow man is a testament of the man you are.  My son who is a police officer says ""well done""."
120736,HTHM,2007-10-05 00:08:00,4082,"So........did you grab your rod and fish the canal while you were waiting??? Glad to hear you're alright. NRP is pretty good, eh?"
120747,mcallister.grant,2007-10-05 01:04:00,327,That's nuts man!!! WOW. Glad you are with us to share it!
120797,POLLIWOGG,2007-10-05 05:24:00,835,"Happened to three of us 27 years ago, a cop chased a car onto the main street where it went sideways and hit us. We almost cut a chevy nova in half with an international scout. Didn't look like it did much to the scout till we noticed it set the body back 3"" off the frame. As both guys in the car came out the drivers door when they hit us and they were after them for a driving offense nobody was convicted because they couldn't tell who was driving.  It was funny, they had just got my bud's head to stop bleeding in the ER when the cop came in looking for statements. The cop said he wasn't chasing them and my friend called Bull on him and started spurting blood all over so the cop wasn't interested in anything we had to say after that and he left."
120802,Big Cliff,2007-10-05 09:22:00,6899,"What I am trying to understand is if there was a spike belt just up ahead, how did the on coming car get past it? Even if the on coming car had somehow missed the spikes, wouldn't there have been cops there?  Most important thing is you came out of it without a scratch!"
120825,dsn,2007-10-05 12:27:00,1018,   Glad no one got hurt except the runner!! And no Pic's?
120845,bigfish1965,2007-10-05 13:42:00,3382," He must have come off of Centre St. Thats the road that runs parallel to the canal in Allanburg. The spike belt was set up on the other side of the bridge where there is no way to escape it. The paper reported the police were 'following' the driver. The car was stolen and the guy had other outstanding warrants for theft. After he stole the car, he proceeded to drive down the main streets of Niagara Falls tossing the contents of the car out the window. Cause when you're in a stolen car, that's the best thing to do to not draw attention to yourself. The paper also reported the suspect was taken to hospital for his 'odd behaviour'. Sounds more like 'high on crack' behaviour...  I took two pics with my cell phone camera, but they have yet to release the data cables for this new phone and the phone end of the cable is a proprietary design. I'll see if I can email them to myself or not."
120847,lew,2007-10-05 13:47:00,12767,"That's some scary stuff Rick, and it's good to hear you were able to do the right thing and get away from that guy.  Kudo's to the coppers too for doing such a great job, as they always do !!  Now let's just hope the courts do their job"
121360,dsn,2007-10-07 10:55:00,1018,  yeah I have no faith in our court system what so ever.
121366,Heybud_e,2007-10-07 12:20:00,208,"holy crap! glad you are safe Rick, some people are just idiots, trying to escape a police car, wonder what he was escaping in? i know that bend extremely well too, speed limit is only 50, sometimes i  become evil and do about 55 lol... did the fix them potholes on the bridge yet?"
120506,bigfish1965,2007-10-04 01:50:00,3382,"I was on my way home from work tonight. I was driving on Hwy 20 coming up to the Welland Canal. As I approached the big 'S' bend that forms the lead-up to the bridge, I noticed some headlights erratically moving in my side view mirror. I saw a car approaching me from behind at a ridiculous speed and he was moving out to pass me. I look up to see a car coming toward us and I think the guy behind me won't be able to see him because of the bend. I moved a bit to the left to block the guys attempt to pass me so as to try and avoid the impending head-on collision. Then I notice about 100 meters back about 12 police cars going like a bat out of hell. I decided that my only course of action was to get off the road as quick as I could to give more room to the guy being chased. I was hoping that he would see me brake hard and right and be able to avoid the collision with the oncoming car. So my brakes are locked up, the  car coming the other way now sees whats going on, he brakes hard right and the guy the police are after follows me hard and right but without braking. He entered the S bend with his rear tires hooked  off the asphalt and on the shoulder gravel. He over corrected, got sideways, slid across the street and sideways into the cable-style guard rail. By now there are cops all braking and one car followed the chasee's car as it slid into the ditch and pinned the drivers side door close. I had no idea we even had this many police cars around. They were everywhere. I was still trying to calm down ( I was convinced the head-on was going to happen...still don't know how it didn't) and then realized I was trapped into the scene. So I watched as about 10 officers surrounded the car all the time yelling 'Police! Hands on the Wheel!"" The lights from the cruisers were too bright for me to see much, but I could here everything perfectly as it was only about 20 feet away from me. I heard a dog, I heard guns being unholstered....I heard the driver screaming...guess he got hurt when he wrecked. Too bad. Almost killed whoever was in that other car. The police were amazingly professional about it all. They got the guy out of the car, he was obviously hurt bad, and they put him into a cruiser and sped off to the hospital. While talking to the police they told me there was a spike belt awaiting him on the other side of the bridge and that they had chased the guy for quite a distance. Still don't know why he was running from the cops. The Sergeant told me to expect a call from the SIU because the driver was injured so then it becomes a whole big thing. The weird thing was that the guy that almost got hit head on saw all the police cars and buggered off. All this happened in just  a few seconds but in the midst of it all it seemed like a lot longer than that. Its amazing how fast your brain can go when you need it to. Just glad no innocent bystanders or officers were hurt...as for the driver...just desserts. Did you really think you were going to outrun the entire police force??"
120509,Crazyhook,2007-10-04 01:53:00,1154,that is a crazy story! glad you are are alright Rick..
120512,fatherof3,2007-10-04 01:57:00,1769,"that is crazy,glad it had a good end result for ya"
120513,Greencoachdog,2007-10-04 01:58:00,8163,"Glad you weren't hurt Rick!!! As for Numbnutz, what??? you're going to outrun a Motorola????... I don't think so!"
120514,frozen-fire,2007-10-04 01:58:00,542,crazy! glad you're okay... good reaction on your part.
120518,Gerritt,2007-10-04 02:02:00,6129,comeon man!! where is your HD Dash mounted camera??!!?... I expect a full video report hosted by Youtube tomorrow! LOL..  glad to see your home safe and sound Rick.  Gerritt.

120527,TJQ,2007-10-04 02:11:00,7806,That is nuts... glad your ok bud...

120537,rapala14,2007-10-04 02:36:00,44,"glad to hear no one was hurt.  must've been quite an adrenaline rush to have front row tickets to that ""event"".  but on a side note, i've always kinda wondered about that, why is there 12 cruisers following one car... why not just 6?  whats the real difference in the end?  6 cops swarming the idiots car or 24 cops swarming the idiots car?  i'm not gonna lie, if i was a cop there's no way i'd wanna miss out on that action.."
120541,bigfish1965,2007-10-04 02:44:00,3382,Probably lots of cars following in case he gets into a residential area..then they can call off the chase and block all exits from the grid.
120543,Hooked,2007-10-04 02:49:00,891,"WOW Rick!  Now that was some story, glad everyone innocent here came out unscaved."
120544,ChrisK,2007-10-04 02:51:00,2772,Sounds like you had yourself a close call Rick.... Glad your Ok .....
120576,John,2007-10-04 11:36:00,2956,Sounds like a scary one Rick. Glad all is OK with you.

120581,pigeonfisher,2007-10-04 12:06:00,696,"Certainly one of the stranger stories I have heard.  Glad all worked out for you, Rick.  Good thing you didn't get the spike belt on the other side of the bridge."

120609,wuchikubo,2007-10-04 13:13:00,1114,"Just glad to hear you are okay and that the only one hurt was that maniac driver.  I've had first row seats to accidents too, I hope it didn't bother your rest last night."
