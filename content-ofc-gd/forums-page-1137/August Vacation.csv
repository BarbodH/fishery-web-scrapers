121444,jjcanoe,2007-10-07 22:01:00,744,Here's some pics of our summer vacation out north of Kingston this past August. Had some issues with my camera so I ended up bringing most of the fish back to the beach in the livewell for a quick photo after which they were all released (alive!)  Here's a nice Largemouth I got out of the slop on a Berkley frog    parked on an island for some fishing and Jr. got this little largie with a worm   He got this Smallmouth on the first day   And a big Largemouth back in the weeds while I was retreiving a snag. He used a mini tube hooked on a red devil spoon   A nice Smallmouth I got on a sluggo   Another smallie at sunset for Jr. on a tube jig   Mr. pike smashed a white moss boss at the edge of the lily pads   jjcanoe

121480,jjcanoe,2007-10-08 01:52:00,744," D'oh! He just turned 6 2 weeks ago and has been doing it since he was 3!  Hmmm, 24-6= 18 more years, then again the daughter is still only 4 months old so I bet I can still outfish her for a few more years.  jjcanoe"
