I didnt get a long window of time before the rain decided to come back so i was out maybe an hour, but a successful hour it was. I started off with a hook, worm and sinker and gave that a shot for about 20 minutes, few small perch nothing worth photographing, soon after i switched my worm to a 3"" plastic smelt and began fishing some weeds, tossing into different pockets for about 10 minutes when i felt a ""SLAM"" so i set the hook and began retreiving and to my surprise i landed and photographed this beast, with my cellular phone, Hope it turns out... till the next time... Bud.. "
