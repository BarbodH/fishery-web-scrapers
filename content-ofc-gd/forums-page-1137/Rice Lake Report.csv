I read something about how its hard catching bass in these type of conditions but I saw someone catching a bass, probably around 2lbs.  Right away, using our plastic Berkly honey worm, we managed to catch tons of perches by just reeling it slowly. I managed to catch around 25 perches, 10 of them were jumbos. Heres a picture of my biggest catch of the day. I know it's just a perch but at least I didn't get skunked.  Oh yeah there were a lot of Asian guys who made my day LOL. They celebrated very loudly when they caught a small fish while I was ride beside them just pulling in perch nonstop. I just love the feeling of out fishing people, it makes me look like a pro. I did not keep any of the fish since I'm a catch and release fishermen. "
