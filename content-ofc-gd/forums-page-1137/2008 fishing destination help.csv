120244,chet,2007-10-03 10:33:00,9,"I have been a long time viewer of this site and finally have registered.  THis site has provided valuable information for me and fishing buddies over the last several years.  I am hoping that more help will come with this inquiry.  I am looking for a place to fish hopefully in late June 2008.  I am from Ohio and have been enjoying atleast one fishing trip a year to Canada.  THis year I would like to go somewhere different.  The following is a list of where we have went over the years: Rice lake for about 20 straight years.  For several reasons we changed it up about 5 years ago Lower Buckhorn for 3 straight years This last year we did a fly-in out of chapleau About 6 years ago we did a fly-in out of Nakina Things we are looking for:  We will be taking our own boats.  After last years fly-in a trolling motor and comfortable seats are a necessity this year.  Electric in the cabins.  Possibly 6 of us to accomodate.  We will cook for ourselves no ""american plan"" is needed.  Target species:  Smallmouth bass, largemouth bass, pike, walleye, and panfish are all fun to catch.  As I said earlier Rice is no longer our cup of tea.  We enjoy solitude and tranquility.  I don't want to have to compete with hundreds of other people.  The more ""rustic"" type of area and cottage suits us just fine.  Smaller lakes are also good.  I have looked at Lake Nippisig and Lake Simcoe, but would prefer something smaller.  Researching on the internet by punching in lakes and hope'ing to find cottages isn't working so well for me.  Any help or advice would be greatly appreciated.  If there is any information I can provide on any of the lakes mentioned above please let me know.  Thanks in advance"
120248,graftongal,2007-10-03 10:55:00,145,"We have stayed here on Lake Chandos in early spring a few times. I'm not sure what the boat traffic is like on the lake in the summer though, it might be quite busy.  http://www.harbourhill.com/"

120254,Blake,2007-10-03 11:49:00,418,Go to the Bay of Quinte.  You may have to put up with some boat traffic but the fishing will be worth it.  Remember the bass fishing opens on the 4rth Sat in June so book around that and good luck.  Mississippi Lake would be another great choice in Eastern Ontario.
120263,chet,2007-10-03 12:28:00,9,"Thanks guys for the information.  Blake, is there a website for cottages on Lake Mississippi?  I believe the Bay of Quinte is too large for us this year.  I plan on taking my 11 year old son for the first time to Canada, the last thing I want to do is be stuck in the cabin due to wind.  He gets bored rather quickly."
120275,Gerritt,2007-10-03 13:12:00,6129,"Chet,  I know you said Lake Nipissing.... but have you considered the West Arm of Lake Nipissing? it is alot smaller then the main lake and definitely more sheltered. It is like an entirely different lake from the main lake.. tons to explore too. Let me know if this is an option and I will provide some info on a few nice camps  Gerritt."
120279,chet,2007-10-03 13:24:00,9,"I would be willing to give Lake Nippissig a try if it isn't one of those lakes that get real windblown.  I fished Rice for 20 years and there were many years where the fishing was limited almost all week because of rain.  Nippissig would also offer lots of panfish to keep the boy busy, also.  I am willing to check almost anything out at this point in the game.   I figured if I start looking this early it may be easier to book a place the first week or two of bass season as well.   Again, thanks for any information.  I have been up since 4AM looking at websites and they all are starting to look the same.  A first hand opinion/suggestion is what I need at this point."
120280,chet,2007-10-03 13:25:00,9,I meant to say the fishing was limited on Rice because of wind not rain.
120285,Gerritt,2007-10-03 13:54:00,6129,www.lakair.com www.welcomelodge.com http://www.samosetlodge.com/  These are all great camps!  As I said if it is a little windblown (which can happen anywhere) you can hit one of the thousands of bays and islands to get out of the wind and calmer conditions..  Being that the west arm is pretty well sheltered though it rarely kicks up like the main lake will.  Here is a map of the West Arm http://www.welcomelodge.com/maps.html  If you need anything else let us know  Gerritt.
120378,Moosebunk,2007-10-03 18:53:00,3970,"http://www.temagami.net/temagami-lodges.html  Here's a number of lodges for the Temagami area an hour north of North Bay.  Tonnes of places to explore in this region, with all the fish species you're looking for.  Unlike Simcoe and Nippissing, this lake is so oddly shaped with numerous backbays that wind would never be a problem ""everywhere"" on the lake."
120380,Musky or Specks,2007-10-03 19:00:00,2710,IM also going to have to recommend the West Arm. Great Fishing and very under utilized.
120390,Tomcat,2007-10-03 19:35:00,395,Sent you a PM.
120442,Fang,2007-10-03 22:50:00,1330,I second the Temagami vote. One of my fav places and can never get there to often enough. Been spending 2-3 weeks a year for last 20 or so. Tons of bass and a number of back lake options for day trips through the lodges on the lake. Call around now though as many camps are booked year after year by repeat guests.  If you were OK with the drive to Nippising I'd also suggest Trout Lake (eastern town limit of North Bay)  For the most part I believe it's underfished. You'll see a fair bit of boat traffic on the west end but mostly tourists not a lot of fishermen  All amenities very close by in North Bay  Others to check out Kashe Lake (lots of panfish) Glouster Pool area of Georgian Bay a little further away is Little and Big Rideau lake - great fishery and just north of Temagami is Lady Evelyn lake with several very nice resorts
120577,chet,2007-10-04 11:40:00,9,Thanks again for the information.  I will begin looking at these selections.  There are so many beautiful lakes to fish in ontario it is difficult to narrow down selections.
120787,scuro,2007-10-05 03:57:00,386,"I'd vote for this resort on Lake Nipigon. http://www.mccollumsresort.com/resort.htm The place is clean and well run. Nothing fancy but great value. The scenery in the area is stunning with very little boat traffic. You see maybe a boat or two if any, on any given day. Bring a small boat and there are plenty of backwoods fishing lakes that will amaze you including some bass lakes. At the ""resort"" you are right on Lake Nipigon so if you have a large boat you can fish for some world class lake trout out on the main lake. Near the resort there is perch, pike, and walleye. The top of Superior is just stunning. Oh and check out the website for their lake Nipigon fishing tour. Met two American older couples there last year. One set came from Texas and stayed the whole summer. The other from Ohio and stayed a few weeks."
120791,Big Tex,2007-10-05 04:28:00,18,"You really want a good trip,I'm from SSM Ont and have fished northern Ont for the last 45 yrs.The last few yrs I've been going to Como Lake Resort (Chapleau area.)Good Lake Trout,Walleye,Northerns and very good whitefish.Lee & Sue Burke the owners, make you feel right at home.Lake is 8 miles long with crystal clear water.I'm going back May 17/08.Appro 170 miles from Sault.

120822,corvette1,2007-10-05 12:16:00,1765,been to leuenbergers in nakina six times go to the keg main lodge 300+walleyes and pike two guys
120951,bpsbassman,2007-10-05 18:11:00,941,"If you're looking at the West Arm (which I don't think you would regret) make sure you check out Memquisit Lodge before committing.  We have been there the last two years and the cottages are exceptionally clean and well maintained and the hosts are second to none. www.memquisit.com Make sure you download their ""Visitor's Guide"", excellent information!"
121154,chet,2007-10-06 08:21:00,9,"Our experience with the chapleau area last year wasn't a very positive one as far as fishing goes.  The area was beautiful, the accomodations were what we expected, everything was good except the fishing.  It may have just been a bad week for fishing, but due to that we would like to experience another area. Corvette1 the nakina area is awesome, but due to this being my 11 year old's first canada trip I don't want to force him in a vehicle for 20 hours, this may be a little much for him to take. The west arm of Nippising sounds promising.  As well as the temagami area.  I will continue to search for the best place suited for our party so keep the information coming.  This is great"
