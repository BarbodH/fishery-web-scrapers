121260,Mike the Pike,2007-10-06 21:58:00,3421,Drove down to my boat dealer to pick up a new plastic fender for my trailer that I cracked earlier this summer $89.00 next I picked up one of those Happy Trollers for my main motor $100.00 .had enough of that .The wife is away with her friends(Stitch and B i t c h) and she was gone with our only tow vehicle(that means no boat) so I decided to take my son shore fishing on the Richelieu River in Sabrevois Quebec about 20kms from the Vermont US border.  Considering the little time frame that we did have I would say we did Ok.I had some pike follows which I missed  Then I hooked into a liitle 3lb snot rocket which I repeated again but Ryan could not get the 2nd pike in the net so   it got away thats fishin.Next Ryan caught a Bass and I told Ryan one more cast for me and managed a little Bass myself.In all not bad for 60 minutes of relaxing fun one on one time with my boy.Here are some pics.  Oh I could here GCD' s redneck voice in my head(ok his comments about fish holds) commenting about the last pike hold over and underhand.Decided to perform the 2 hand underhand hold   GCD                MTP
