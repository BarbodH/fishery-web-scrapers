121080,fatherof3,2007-10-06 00:44:00,1769,"Went down to my spot after school with Ethan for a few hours.He loved having a picinic supper by the water.Anway,the fishing was really slow for the first hour and a half with not even a single bite.Ethan was hoping I would catch something as I had told him he would be taking the pics.Here are a few pics of how my cameraman kept himself busy.     He insisted on playing instead of fishing tonight which is fine with me,wouldn't want to force him to do it.Eventually he got his turn with the camera as the later it got the more the bite seemed to pick up.Here are the results of 3 hours fishing.    The last fish decided to do one huge run at the start and actually came as close to spooling me as possible.He took off,went into the rapids and around the island in the middle of the river.By the time he stopped I only had a few wraps of line left on my reel but thankfully he then decided to sit in the faster water and force me to drag him in.On a side note I could not get over how much the river has dropped in the last couple of days.It is by far the lowest I have seen it."
121085,Greencoachdog,2007-10-06 00:51:00,8163,Great report and pics!!! Seems like Ethan is a natural with the camera!

121111,Mike the Pike,2007-10-06 03:11:00,3421,Nice pics and Happy fisherman  MTP
121116,kennyman,2007-10-06 03:38:00,737,Paris great for fishing. Now the area from the dam to the high level bridge is a sanctuary until November 1st. Your pic is just past there isn't it?
121120,fatherof3,2007-10-06 03:49:00,1769,"Kennyman,yes I am just past the high level and the santuary is actually from the dam to the William street bridge which is the bridge closer to the dam."
121123,kennyman,2007-10-06 03:55:00,737,AHHHH. Very good to know. I caught a bunch of bass right there on what I thought was the last day (Sept 30th) before the change. So for that little stretch and I believe up to 500 feet past the bridge you can still fish AND use live bait???
121126,Mike Pike,2007-10-06 03:58:00,1332,"Looks like we enjoy fishing the same watershed.  Always enjoy you reports, fatherof3, and it's great to see you taking your 'cameraman' with you!  Cheers!"
121128,fatherof3,2007-10-06 04:00:00,1769,"100m downstream of highway 2 bridge(highlevel) you can use live bait,after that is single barbless artificial only.If I remember there is a sign up at an access point where this section starts"
121130,kennyman,2007-10-06 04:03:00,737,"AHHH, 100 meteres to the ""exceptional waters""."
121131,fatherof3,2007-10-06 04:03:00,1769,"thanks Mike,I really like fishing the Grand since you never know what you will get.My ""cameraman"" loves coming with me but only wants to catch the little ones,lol"
