121439,Blake,2007-10-07 21:54:00,418,Just wishing all the members a great Thanksgiving.  It truly is a time to reflect and be thankful for all the special people in our lives who have been such great help and support over the years.  Also try to remember those who are not with us anymore but were special people when they were in our lives.
