After casting spoon after spoon looking for some salmon after the rains last night, I set up a bottom rig with a good ole worm on it.  A serious tug on the line and this is what I brought in....a BIG BULLHEAD.  Now, the Ontario record is 16.38 inches and 2.37 pounds...caught in 1989.  This one measured in at 15 inches and 2.10 pounds!!!  We used our Berkley digital scale for the ""unofficial"" weigh in.  Here are two pics of the same fish...one to show perspective on how thick the fish was (and no I didn't land it in the net...LOL).  The second is the beauty shot...haha.      Too bad this isn't an OFAH species for the angler awards....LOL."
121505,frozen-fire,2007-10-08 06:57:00,542,that's an enormous bullhead! wow!
121506,dsn,2007-10-08 11:21:00,1018,I know these are LED lights. But they also do look like diamonds or jewlery   I guess that what all night time fishermen wear.  I need to get a set. I guess CT has some. But how bright are they? And how much?
121510,fatherof3,2007-10-08 12:03:00,1769,"wow,ugly but big wtg"

121514,mattyk,2007-10-08 12:26:00,2110,thats a big bullhead. You are the master of different species!
121515,Roy,2007-10-08 12:31:00,13728,WTG Cliff. Do a search on cat recipes :-)  I think bullheads are way purdier than carp. Smarter too!
121519,Whopper,2007-10-08 12:43:00,2174, Matt maybe we should have went fishing with Cliff
121520,TJQ,2007-10-08 12:43:00,7806,Nice cliff...  Fishing with a tiara brings you luck!!

121523,Mike the Pike,2007-10-08 12:52:00,3421,Cliff do you feed the fish before you catch em.Nice cat fish must of had some of your left over turkey  MTP
121535,Guest Johnny Bass,2007-10-08 13:55:00,0,"Nice! But I caught a bigger bullhead than that at old mill. And once my dad caught a huge bullhead  5+ lbs at Canal road(holland river). It was actually starting to turn blue!! Although there are only bullheads in that river, someone may have threw in another catfish species...."
121562,Toronto_Angler,2007-10-08 15:10:00,698,Damn nice Bullhead! Reminds me of when I was young and we use to catch bullheads with worms down at the rouge river mouth. Good times.
121633,iceguy,2007-10-08 19:00:00,341,That was a channel cat you caught Johnny bass. They can get much bigger than that. 100 lbs down in the bayou.
121664,Dano,2007-10-08 20:20:00,719,"Good stuff Cliff! A buddy of mine caught what I believe would be a record mooneye a few years back and I caught a monster rock bass that was so big it didnt look normal at all and I thought (after) it would be cool to have a record, any record but difficult to find official scales when you are in the middle of nowhere."
