121318,issamhay,2007-10-07 03:14:00,77,"well ive recently been trying tubes and they seem to be working quite well for bass however i rarely get hook ups, 80% of the times i feel a bite but alas it seems like te fish didnt bite the hook, ive just been putting a weight inside the tube and then hooking it with a pretty llarge hook at the head. Can anyone explain to me how to properly rig a tube or show me a good site for it, thnx alot."
121321,Zib,2007-10-07 03:18:00,369,I use a tube jig with my tubes. I rig them like this:    I will either use a jig that has a 90 degree hook (like pictured above) or one that has a 60 degree hook for thos weedy spots.
121329,OhioFisherman,2007-10-07 03:48:00,6623,"The picture that Zib posted is probably the most common way, a tube and a tube jig insert, just slide it in and where the hook eye makes a bump you just poke it thru to tie your line. It works fine for areas that aren`t real weedy.  Another method of rigging is to texas rig them, use a 3/0 to 5/0 wide gap hook, choice of weights. A standard slip sinker (worm weight) and I usually peg them with a toothpick or rubber sinker stop.  The also make weights that go inside the tube and are threaded on the hook as it is inserted. You can also fish them on a Carolina rig or rigged texas style with out a weight for surface action.  The was a good picture of rigging them tex-posed posted by one of the Harrison`s, don`t know how to find it though. Tex-posed is a texas rig with the hook point slightly buried to prevent fouling by weeds, or wood.  Tubes are sort of small, if your missing hits it is probably panfish. gobies, hitting it.  They make the jig inserts with a variety of hooks, some have a longer shank that others which is good for longer tubes, different hook eye angles.  http://queticofishing.com/tubejigrigging.htm  http://www.mizmo.com/texasriggingforbass.html"
