121403,Roy,2007-10-07 15:31:00,13728,"Well you have two choices. You can either go cook it at your girlfriend's place or bake it. Just stuff the cavity with whatever you like, hold the cavity closed with picks or twine. Drop the fish in a buttered shallow dish of the Corning ware variety. It'll be done when it becomes a challenge to pick the fish up in one piece."
121405,Daplumma,2007-10-07 15:46:00,1961,I usually use a deep fat fryer and do it outside on the deck.Baked catfish just doesn't taste so good to me. Joe

121425,oxcowboy,2007-10-07 18:21:00,544,"i too usually deep fry it as well, but sometimes i will bake it.  put a few spoon fulls of butter and a light shake of lemon pepper seasoning.  cook at 350 for about 20 minutes, depending on size of course. its simple and pretty good.  jason"
121431,HTHM,2007-10-07 20:24:00,4082,Thank you for your advice they all sound good. I will have to try them.
121436,Mike Pike,2007-10-07 21:13:00,1332,"I love almost any kind of panfried fish.  Unfotunately, some in the household don't like the smell it leaves in the house.  I have found, though, that fish panfried in in butter leaves WAY less of a smell in the house than fish fried in oil.  Maybe try that first before you have to suffer the indignaty of baking."
121445,Sandbag,2007-10-07 22:04:00,533,"I usually use a coleman stove on the seck or in the garage during the cold weather.  Have been doing it for years.  i find when deep frying, it's not so much the fish that smells, but the oil.  Craig"
