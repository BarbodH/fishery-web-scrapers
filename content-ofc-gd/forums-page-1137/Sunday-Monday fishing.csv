This stick was a good foot out of the water before all the rain.did get to meet a fellow board member down there though.  that pic is Ethan and Kennyman trying their luck.Was nice meeting you.Here are a couple more pics of the conditions.   Was awaken Monday morning by Ethan asking if we could try again so after breakfast we headed down.Here is what greeted us.   Meet up with a guy I have seen down there a few times and in short order Scott had this.   Well,here I am with a skunk and running out of time as the in-laws are coming over for dinner.Just before we were going to head out I feel that familiar tug on my line and after a good fight I managed to land this guy.  Here is Ethan's attempt at a release shot.  Ethan was again my camera man for my carp pics and think he did a good job for a 6 year old.After that we had to leave but might sneak back out again tonight."
