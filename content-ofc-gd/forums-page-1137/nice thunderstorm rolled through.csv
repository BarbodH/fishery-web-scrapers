We had to take cover under the bridge while it stormed for almost an hour.Got some much needed rain but messed my morning fishing up as the river is chocolate and full of crap,lol.So,just a heads up that it is coming.Here are a few pics while we waited it out.      Might go down later and see if it is better.Need my fishing fix."

121363,Jer,2007-10-07 11:30:00,1426,"We were fishing a small lake near Apsley yesterday, on the water at about 7:30 and got caught out in abit of a storm around 9:00 am. When we saw the first lightning strike, we high-tailed it back to the launch and waited it out in the truck. After an hour or so, the worst had passed and we headed back out. Nothing but scattered showers the rest of the day and it remained warm and calm.  Unfortunately, the bite was off all day. All we could manage was lots of rockbass, a few dink SM and one semi-decent LM."
