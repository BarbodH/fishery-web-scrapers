The   doctor comes in and informs the dad that his son was born without  a torso,  arms or legs.  The son is just a head!  But the  dad loves his son and raises him as well as he can, with love and compassion.   After 21 years, the son is now old enough for his first drink.  Dad takes him to the bar, tearfully tells the son he is proud of him and orders up the biggest, strongest drink for his boy.  With all the bar patrons looking on curiously and the bartender shaking his head in disbelief, the boy takes his first sip of alcohol.    Swoooosh!  Plop!  A torso pops out!  The bar is dead silent; then bursts into whoops of joy.  The father, shocked, begs his  son to drink again.  The patrons chant  ""Take another drink!""  The bartender continues to shake his head in dismay .  Swoooosh! Plip! Plop!  Two arms pop out. The bar goes wild.  The father crying and wailing, begs his son to drink again.  The  patrons chant, ""Take another drink!  Take another drink!""  The bartender ignores the whole affair and goes back to polishing glasses, shaking his head, clearly unimpressed by the amazing scenes.  By now the boy is getting tipsy, but with his new hands he reaches down, grabs his drink and guzzles the last of it.  Plop! Plip! Two legs pop out. The bar is in chaos.  The father falls to his knees and tearfully thanks God.  The boy stands up on his new legs and stumbles to the left then staggers to the right through the front door, into the street where a truck runs over him and  kills him instantly.  The bar falls silent. The father moans in grief.  The bartender sighs and says,      (Wait for it.)    *   *    *  (It's coming.)    *   * (Ya ready)        (Don't hate me!)     *   (Yer gonna hate me!)    *    *   *      *   * "" He should've quit while he  was a head!"""
