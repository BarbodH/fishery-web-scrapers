424940,Big Cliff,2010-01-22 22:22:00,6899, When did the bounty come into effect? I was under the impression there wasn't one.
425043,AzuluSpookd,2010-01-23 04:14:00,348,"There isn't one.  Some local townships are thinking of offering one, but still have yet to get approval from the MNR. I don't think you'll see the full support of the government, after how you saw how they caved to the outcry (a few people) in toronto this past summer. "
