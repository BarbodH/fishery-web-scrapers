424499,cityfisher,2010-01-21 16:06:00,959,As some of you have noticed this mild winter is getting even more mild. +6 and TONES of rain in the forecase for Sunday monday and no Solid snow for a while !  Be careful if you decide to venture out on the ice!!
424513,anders,2010-01-21 16:25:00,1168,"that cant be good for conditions down there at all....we have a foot of good ice up here, and would imagine that those conditions would kill up here"
424522,solopaddler,2010-01-21 16:59:00,8605,Great if you're looking to get out steelheading.
424524,highdrifter,2010-01-21 17:06:00,2534, Ya beat me to it.  Hot Diggity!
424528,Meegs,2010-01-21 17:20:00,249,"lol   was thinking the same thing and here i put the float rods away for the season.!   That much rain with those temps shouldnt affect the ice that bad, its only 2 days worth, and still cool at nights, and with the lows of -10 for tuesday that'll make it a total skating rink out there!"
424535,DRIFTER_016,2010-01-21 17:31:00,10439,Rain? The closest I have come to rain since October is -9C. I expect to see some in May.
424554,Sinker,2010-01-21 18:55:00,8692,"It will only make the ice better, no worries. I bet by next weekend, we have more ice than we do now.  S."
424588,HTHM,2010-01-21 21:49:00,4082,Hey I got a TDI I want to try out next week......in Ontario
424598,Handlebarz,2010-01-21 22:49:00,3790,It sure can mess our season here on LSC and the Thames river if London opens the dam and they start to run the pumps from the creeks that will mess things up here for a good long time if the river opens it maybe be over with just three trips in this year Oh well that is ice fishing in SW Ontario
424601,mossyoak_ontario,2010-01-21 23:07:00,12,"Might make for some bad ice fishin, but sure will make shed hunting a crap load easier"
424726,waterwolf,2010-01-22 05:05:00,556,"bit early for sheds ,no?   i still see some bucks with full head gear."
424750,outllaw,2010-01-22 12:31:00,1232,"contrary to a website  in southern ont. the ice is rotten boys. wait for a hard freeze . l.s.c. is bad.with many 4 wheelers getting wet you would think, common sense would prevail. i bet the coast guard chopper logs hours this weekend."
424766,Raf,2010-01-22 13:23:00,3495,ice is/will be fine for all but southwestern ontario
424804,johnnyb,2010-01-22 16:03:00,3413,Yup..nice and cold at night....little bit of rain...more and more ice!  I think a pair of skates will make those long walks on Simcoe a heck of a lot easier
424880,Paully,2010-01-22 20:11:00,712,  I've heard of some going shed hunting Jan. 1st..  If you watch an area you can get a better idea when they lose em.
