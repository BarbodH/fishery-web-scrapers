Buddy picked up about 30 keeper Perch to take home. I tried with the jig and only talked up a half dozen. Minnows did the trick. Left there around noon, headed to Innisfil for Whities. Right off the bat buddy had one on, lost it about 20 feet up. Marked lots for a while but no takers. We moved to a few other holes and started to mark fish, I dropped my jig down and WHAM what a hog, I think it's my biggest Whitie ever. 27"" got to go 7 to 8 LBS. We gaffed it up pretty bad, trying to get it up the small hole, we kept missing. Man did that fish fight, but we won out. "
