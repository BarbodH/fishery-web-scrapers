425217,tomO,2010-01-24 01:32:00,363,I posted this question yesterday but can't find it so I'll try again. I'm redoing my trailer and I have 480-12 tires on it and was thinking of puttin 530-12 ties on instead my question is can I put the heavier tires on the old rims as they are still in good shape or will I need new rims also? If I missed my other post sorry for asking again but either I'm blind or it didnt appear on the board .
425267,vance,2010-01-24 04:22:00,719,Most times it is cheaper to buy tires and rims as a package.check out princess auto.The main question is what is the bolt pattern!!  vance
425317,tomO,2010-01-24 14:00:00,363,four bolt pattern Vance.

I would be more concerned about having enough clearance to run the 530, remember to take into consideration the tire travel when you hit bumps and are loaded."
425373,tomO,2010-01-24 18:42:00,363,Ok George thx. I'm redoing the trailer and had to cut off the coupler as it was welded on going to replace it with a 2 inch also the guide ons were welded to the frame and I cut them too and will replace with bolt ons. I just pushed it  in the basement to rewire and such. I may not be posting again cause when the wife see's it and craps her pants I may be killed. Lol the basements finished and I put a tarp down to protect the carpet but she might get annoyed.
