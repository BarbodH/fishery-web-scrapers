424014,pike slayer,2010-01-19 23:37:00,1177,"a few buddies and i always have a tradition to have a victory gar after the first fish! and to think of it, i dont recall smokin one, reeling and catching a fish other then ice fishing. so im gonna say it does"
424015,12footspringbok,2010-01-19 23:37:00,459,"Fish love the smoking. Not that i smoke cigarettes.... However twice once while cleaning walleye out west when i was a kid we found two cigarette butts in a walleye, and i think it was two years ago i found one cigarette but in a perches stomach. Kinda strange finding that one but twice. Maybe i should start using cigarettes as bait?"
424016,canuckjack,2010-01-19 23:37:00,121,"Nothing better than a having cigar while out on the water   I laughed when I read your post Muskybugged, I've had to pull in a fair bit of line by hand after melting it...."
424039,bigugli,2010-01-20 00:34:00,6138,What's so strange about that. I've been known to need long naps   under the shade of a big willow with line tied to my finger. Great way to mellow out.
424051,Greencoachdog,2010-01-20 01:12:00,8163," Take a trip and never leave the farm!   Tie that sting to your toe Bubba, they're more sensitive yanno!  Things got fuzzy and things got blurry... then everything was gone!  .. just wandering around behind the little animals!"
424071,bigfish1965,2010-01-20 02:14:00,3382,"Well we me and douG had the winning weight for the great Crayola Invitational, I was smoking up a storm and the music was cranked REALLY loud so we kinda shattered two myths at once...we were in a tin boat too. doug does not smoke and I caught more than him  trolling outta the same boat, so I would call the myth busted for sure."
424090,NANUK,2010-01-20 02:56:00,797," Ditto here Lew. I smoked for well over 20 years and now am smoke free for 8 years, I used to have cravings for about 2 years after I quit but Now the smell makes me want to puke, so no smoking in my house or vehicle. That has Nothing to do with sense of pride or being a reformed smoker. I didn't have the heart to tell my buddies about not smoking in my boat BUT I think that is going to change in 2010."
424110,Greencoachdog,2010-01-20 03:31:00,8163," ... as I remember the story being told back then, douG claimed he was just getting ""sloppy seconds""!"
424113,hammercarp,2010-01-20 03:40:00,964, That's a mirror carp. Smoke 'n' mirrors
424181,bigbuck,2010-01-20 14:56:00,2449,"Thankfully I was never a professional smoker, I would have the odd smoke here and there socially but I never had a craving for a cigarette. Cigars are another matter, those I buy and enjoy occasionally. Like Lew, nobody smokes in my house and I mean nobody. As for the boat, I haven't had any smokers aboard yet but if something gets burned, it gets bought."
424197,daryl0815,2010-01-20 15:59:00,225,"I have noticed that smoking definitely increases my catch rate, I light a smoke, and get a bite, it is really strange, maybe the fish can sense the calmed nerves through the line...."
424202,Headhunter,2010-01-20 16:23:00,5703,^^^^^ That's why they are called fish whistles! HH
424206,elusive,2010-01-20 17:11:00,77,caught more fish blitzed than sober LOL

424727,basskicker09,2010-01-22 05:06:00,144,if cigs are fish whistles then a Bong must be much better to smoke it would be a fish horn  i smoke and i dont think it affects anything other then my pocket book
424734,GoneFishin,2010-01-22 05:45:00,349, Agreed. I've thrown away a few smokes on slow days. Every time you light that smoke BAM
424754,fisherman7,2010-01-22 12:49:00,325,I tried smoking a fish once but couldn't get it lit!
424833,Bob,2010-01-22 18:14:00,370,"I realise there are reformed smokers out there who are not rude or nasty to folks who smoke.  I had an uncle who used to ask me to blow a little smoke his way when we had coffee together.  That was 10 to 15 years after he quit.  My mother quit for many years but she still put ashtrays out for visitors who smoked.  I'll guarantee, though, that anytime a smoker runs into snide nasty comments or pushy proselytising, it WILL be coming from a reformed smoker. There's absolutely no doubt in my mind about that."
424952,Musky or Specks,2010-01-22 23:09:00,2710,I only smoke a pipe and only in the spring of the year flyfishing brooky rivers when the black flies are horrendous. It does a great job of keeping them out of your eyes and face
424968,superchaser,2010-01-22 23:42:00,10,"  Been there done that but didnt realize until my float, line, leader, and roe bag were out of sight!"
423899,MSBruno,2010-01-19 19:12:00,369,Who smokes?  Who doesn't?  Smoking affect fishing?  Thoughts welcome.  Mark
423901,Kinger,2010-01-19 19:18:00,351,How do you even hold the bong and your rod at the same time?
423902,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-01-19 19:23:00,0,"For all the emphasis some anglers put on using scented presentations etc., it's funny to see an angler smoking a dart.  We know that some smells will attract or repel a fish.  Then again,  when I'm out fishing I like to have a cigar here and there to celebrate being fishing.  If my wife is any indication, the fish probably don't like that smell much."
423905,Dara,2010-01-19 19:36:00,3052,I'm pretty sure it affects your ability to hump it 10k back into a spec lake in the park.
423909,Bob,2010-01-19 19:55:00,370,"I've been smoking for fifty years or so and fishing longer than that.  I've never found it to make a difference, I frequently catch more fish than my non-smoking buddies.  I haven't seriously hunted in some years but the last two times I went to the deer camp, I won the pot for dragging the first deer in so it doesn't seem to bother them either.  This is not an endorsement for smoking, if you haven't started, don't.  I still enjoy my smokes but the alienation and discrimination is a pain.  Funny part of that is that most of it doesn't come from real non-smokers but from reformed smokers, they want to lay their crap all over everyone.  Don't know if they're still ugly from withdrawal or just have an overblown sense of pride or something.  It's ok to crap all over me now."
423912,Dozer,2010-01-19 19:58:00,896,"I'm sure over the years it wouldn't make your rod limp.  ...as for catching fish, I heard and read about how it nicotine can affect fish ( especially rainbow trout ) but then again we find white fish with butts in their stomachs..."
423914,Paully,2010-01-19 20:02:00,712,  I've never seen a butt that sinks   ..  Do they come up for top water lures?
423916,asdve23rveavwa,2010-01-19 20:08:00,2690,"I quit a year and a half ago...and haven't noticed any difference in numbers of fish overall...in fact alot of times I would hook fish while smoking.  Yet, I have read that the smell is a fish deterent.  Blah, blah, blah..."
423917,jediangler,2010-01-19 20:08:00,1923,A few alterations Kinger and this could be converted to a bong holder. 
423918,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-01-19 20:12:00,0,a bongholder?  i envision some hippy laying on a river bank napping with his fishing line tied to his pinky toe and worm on a red/white bobber in the river!
423922,Dozer,2010-01-19 20:24:00,896," Eh, maybe it wasn't whitefish, it was in a thread last week... ya, wouldn't be whitefish now could it... Its 3:30 in the afternoon... its still early"
423925,Flappn,2010-01-19 20:26:00,245,It's funny I have often wondered if Smoking does effect fishing and I'm not braging by any means but I have been off the butts for almost 2 years and I have not noticed a difference at all in my catch success rate.  I still miss the sexy little nic stix every day........................
423928,Headhunter,2010-01-19 20:34:00,5703,"Come on people, get it right... they are called ""fish whistles""! The only thing that works faster at attracting a fish, is to start eating some food... the fish know, they really do! And Bob, I agree with you 100%! No bashin from me! HH"
423931,lew,2010-01-19 20:43:00,12766," Not necessarily so with everybody Bob, I smoked for 30 years and have now been off them for close to 20 years, and I won't allow anybody to smoke in my boat, truck or especially my home. It's got nothing to do with laying crap all over anyone and my sense of pride for kicking those filthy things is for me alone and as for withdrawal, quitting never bothered me so I'm certainly not ugly about it.  The plain and simple truth is that now, the stench from 2nd had smoke makes me want to puke so I'd just as soon not be around anyone who does smoke. I've certainly got nothing against smokers and have NEVER suggested anybody should quit, I'd just prefer you don't do it in or on anything I own.  So to answer the original question as to whether smoking affects your fishing success, I guess the answer would be that yes, in MY boat your success would be VERY poor"
423934,Terry,2010-01-19 20:44:00,14456,hippies don't fish do they  I mean dopers just sit on the couch and smoke and eat  don't they

423973,muskeybugged,2010-01-19 22:09:00,282,Smoking is fun while fishing until you bring your smoke within close range of your line ..... Re tie  I quit smoking oct 16 ain't caught nothing since
423976,purekgw,2010-01-19 22:16:00,585,never have smoked and never will waste of money and i cant stand the smell
423985,Syn,2010-01-19 22:29:00,519,    As long as the smoker is not throwing the cig butts in the water then I don't mind smokers. It's hard to smoke while trying to reel in and land a fish. Bad habit and waste of money imo.
423987,Sinker,2010-01-19 22:31:00,8692,"I smoke more when I fish, than I normally do. I catch fish, so I don't think it makes any difference. Presentation will out fish scent every day of the week.  S."
424012,Greencoachdog,2010-01-19 23:35:00,8163,"Cigarette smoking is good for fishing! It calms me down and relaxes me.  ... if I run out of cigarettes while fishing, I slit the throat of everything I catch and throw it back in for the Gulls and Turtles... then laugh like a fiend about it!  ... as opposed to releasing 95% of my catch when I don't run out of smokes."
