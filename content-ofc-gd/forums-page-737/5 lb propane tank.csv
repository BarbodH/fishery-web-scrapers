424527,Meegs,2010-01-21 17:11:00,249,Great thread and info guys!   really appreciated!   I curse every time i have to go buy new 1 lbs tanks with the price that they want for them!    i'll be sure to drop by princess auto when i get home!
424530,DRIFTER_016,2010-01-21 17:23:00,10439, Best bet is to get a filter for the line too. Ig goes between the heater and hose to prevent any debris from entering the heater as some of the hoses can break down over time. The debris will pooch your heater in a hurry.  Fuel Filter Link
424659,Rob,2010-01-22 01:31:00,467,"Make sure you check the date on the tank as well, as some stores may have them on the shelf for 5 years and then your tank is only good for 5 more years and you just got burned by the store for 5 years. Do you all follow me?!  Rob C"
424720,waterwolf,2010-01-22 04:30:00,556,great info thrown out about the 5lb tanks .i still like the idea of milkin' the 20lb tank to the 1lb'er.where do you find the valve to do connect the two? i've been savin' empty 1lb'ers with hopes to fill a few for reserves. those little tanks are gettin' pretty rich at CTC.

420919,walleyejack,2010-01-11 01:04:00,358,Anyone know where one can locate a 5 lb propane tank ? I tried syphoning off my 20lb into the 1 lbers but doesn t seem to work for me. CTC doesn t even have any
420920,irishfield,2010-01-11 01:05:00,26272,Last year the Richmond Hill CTC had 5 lb tanks on the shelf. Pull up the CTC website and go store to store looking for stock..
420930,walleyejack,2010-01-11 01:14:00,358,thank you
420931,Terry,2010-01-11 01:15:00,14456,I find it works better if the 1lb tank is lower then /below the 20lb tank
420937,walleyejack,2010-01-11 01:27:00,358,"I must not be too sharp, CTC  does not list 5 lb tanks, 20lb and stuff that goes with them, i will have to go to a store and have them do a search for me."
420942,Terry,2010-01-11 01:39:00,14456,
420943,irishfield,2010-01-11 01:41:00,26272,Good show Terry... I seached Propane tank.. and it didnt' come up! BBQ Tank ! lol  Shows in stock in Midland.. but I wouldn't hold my breath.. have never seen one in there.. as of Friday even.  Also says in stock in BOTH Whitby CTC stores..
420950,Jigs_up,2010-01-11 01:53:00,11,Check out TSC and Home Hardware. They both carry them locally but it could be a local thing.   Cheers
420957,walleyejack,2010-01-11 01:59:00,358,"OK . Thanks very much. i searched propane tank, thats why it didn t show. Thanks Terry and Irish"
420958,DRIFTER_016,2010-01-11 02:00:00,10439,I got mine at Home Hardware.  5# Propane Tank
420960,Fisherpete,2010-01-11 02:04:00,1814,"All 5 of my local Scarborough CT stores show ""in stock"" for both the 5lb and 8.8lb tanks... darn, now I have to go and buy one LOL and the hose adapter too... there goes $80+!!!! I looked last year and nobody had any...  Oh well, it will pay for itself in one season pretty much... those 1lb tanks are nearly $5 each these days!"
420976,Fang,2010-01-11 02:21:00,1330,saw 5lb tanks a coburg walmart and CTC today
420999,jerdog,2010-01-11 03:13:00,39,I got one ordered in (maybe 3 day wait) at the Brooklin Home Hardware.  I've seen 8lb'ers at the CT on Taunton but really expensive.  Even the regular 5lb'ers are quite a bit more expensive than a regular 20.  Good luck.
421037,Jonny,2010-01-11 04:59:00,1380,What kind of prices are being asked for these five-pounders?  I went to the local Superior Propane dealer and they were asking $79 each!

421040,irishfield,2010-01-11 04:59:00,26272,$45 at CTC.. plus of course a one time purge fee and filling at your local propane dealer.. if you can find one anymore that fills and isn't just a 20lb trade a tank.
421063,dave524,2010-01-11 12:22:00,4508,"Costco in St Catharines fills 20 pounders for about $5 less than the truck stop or garage here in town. I looked into a small tank, 5 pounder,  some time ago ago to run a propane cooking burner on for day trips, more expensive than a 20 pounder   They seem to be priced like AAA batteries vs AA,  pay more for less."
421068,bigugli,2010-01-11 14:05:00,6138, It all evens out. Think of how many trips to the chiro you won't make because you are lugging a 5# instead of a 20# tank.
424355,PERCHER,2010-01-21 02:37:00,787,If you are still looking for 5lber I have one brand new with an 6ft hose for 40.00 Dan
424363,duckdog,2010-01-21 03:02:00,162,I got mine here at nippising propane for 34.99 purge and fill was $3 more
424378,leighfns,2010-01-21 03:47:00,103,What do you need to get to allow a mr heater to use a 5lb tank?  A hose for sure is there anything else?
424380,walleyejack,2010-01-21 03:54:00,358,"just a hose thats it, nothing else"
424399,PERCHER,2010-01-21 04:49:00,787,sold
424450,Uncle Buck,2010-01-21 13:37:00,1000,Picked up my 8.8lb tank at princess auto for $30...  $5 to purge it (one time only) pioneer gas stations are cheapest $7 to fill it - pioneer gas stations are cheapest  You need a hose also $15 for 4 ft - lowes sells it the cheapest
424459,Fisherman,2010-01-21 14:42:00,7201,"Ha, picked up my 4 ft hose at Wmart, $15 and had the new 5lb tank purged and filled for $3.49 at Costco."
