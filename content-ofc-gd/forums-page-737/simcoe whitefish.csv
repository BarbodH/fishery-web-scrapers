425182,Terry,2010-01-23 23:44:00,14456,"got back out for whitefish I started off where I got all of them last weekend it was dead, they were swimming around but no one was getting a bite we moved to 70 ft and I put down the camera saw  I had a good picture so I put the recorder on it was hard to keep the lure in front of the camera, the williams whitefish darts around at times most fish just swam by and didn't even look at the lure but I did get 3 of them and lost a couple more here is a bit of underwater video back out tomorrow   "

425219,Sinker,2010-01-24 01:49:00,8692,"Cool video Terry! Its crazy how many are down there!  Thanks for posting that, and keep them coming. I'd love to see you hook one on the camera!  S."
425225,crappieperchhunter,2010-01-24 02:32:00,2582,That is fun too watch...nice toy you got there.  I spent my first full day today with my new toy... a Vex a friend sold me. Watching those red lines come up off the bottom to meet your spoon...PRICELESS.  Wish I had taken the plunge years ago.  Your camera is the next step past that. Thx for posting the vid.
425240,Joey,2010-01-24 03:07:00,9122,Great video Terry.  See you tomorrow.  Joey
425253,Leecher,2010-01-24 03:49:00,7832,"Love the video footage Terry But tell me, how far are you from the camera..... looks like you're some distance away judging from seeing your jigging lure?  Leechman"
425286,Terry,2010-01-24 10:03:00,14456,"was only about 5 ft away  but with current and the way the williams whitefish angles away from the hole, who know how far it ends up away  I also have footage from the same hole where it looks like the lure is going to hit the camera it's so close"
425335,jaydub,2010-01-24 15:11:00,145,"Awesome video Terry,  I was out yesterday morning with a few buddies for about 5 hrs without even a bite...your video gives me hope that they were probably there, just not hungry!  I was curious to see what other people around us caught but sounds like it was maybe a slow day for everyone.  Keep posting those videos!"
425443,maksuttt,2010-01-24 22:36:00,21,Nice video! Fun to watch:) Thanks! Max
425492,Terry,2010-01-25 01:20:00,14456,"I like making the underwater videos but it is very distracting, I keep forgetting to fish while watching live fish TV and recording takes even more attention but I will do more of them"
425506,Fish Farmer,2010-01-25 01:47:00,2234,"Thanks for sharing Terry, I always wanted to see those Whities down there. Be nice seeing them feeding. My camera only has 50' of cable, only good for Perch. Love those Whities. Can't wait for your next video"
