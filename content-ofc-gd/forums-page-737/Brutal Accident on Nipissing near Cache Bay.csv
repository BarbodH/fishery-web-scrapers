425152,Muskieman,2010-01-23 21:30:00,2472,A young man apparently hit a rock at high speeds with his snowmobile ejecting both him and his girlfriend  ...I just got back from Cache Bay  ...@ around 13:00 this afternoon ... the West Nipissing Search & Rescue sleds & sleighs drove by with flashers on at 75mph...followed closely by Volunteer vehicles carrying EMT's  With an Ambulance and plenty of OPP's on shore ...  20 Minutes later a F 150 drove by carrying 2 EMT's in the bed performing CPR on the young 17 yr old victim..  I know the family and the Individual.....  his prognosis is bleak and might not live.  Prayers go out to the family.  RFS

425161,musky66,2010-01-23 21:56:00,273,What else can you say? It happens far too often- especially with the young. So sad.

425167,Slop,2010-01-23 22:38:00,151,What a horrible tragedy and loss of young life. Very sad.
425169,capt_hooked,2010-01-23 22:54:00,212,I hate hearing that... but thank you for the news... (I think?) too close to home...  those damn snow machines go too fast.. way too fast...   my sympathies go out to the families involved.. a real tragedy...
425273,Jonny,2010-01-24 05:10:00,1380,"Oh man, so sad to hear that. There but for the grace of God... (when I was younger). My heart goes out to the young lad and his family.  I agree that sleds are set up to be way too fast. There's no need for a speed above 80-85 kph in almost any situation. The conditions in which you can safely run a sled at above that speed are few and far between, IMO."
