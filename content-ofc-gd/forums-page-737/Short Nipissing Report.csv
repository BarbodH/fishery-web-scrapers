Headed up to Sandy Bay for a couple of days with a group of guys from work.  Fished Tuesday afternoon and all day Wednesday, then returned home on Thursday.  Fished about two miles out in @34 FOW.  As soon as the lines went in, the perch were there to greet us and they stuck around with a steady bite pretty much the whole time we were there.  One Pickeral caught about ten minutes after we got to the huts of the first day.  White jighead tipped with a minnow was producing, as were Buckshots, jigging raps and plain old hook and minnow.  Did have to downsize everything a bit to catch the perch or they would rob you blind all day long.  The highlight of the trip was one of the guys hooking and landing a pike @ 7lbs on his trusty Ron Popeil pocket fisherman.  Talk about laugh.  All in all was a great trip.  Enough fish for a fry and a great time with some good friends.  As always, Jeff and Kim at Sandy Bay were great hosts and took good care of us.  Tried to get some pictures in here, but I'm having Photobucket issues.  Cheers  Craig"
