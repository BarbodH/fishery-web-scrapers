I've always loved Waylon Jennings, as I remember my Dad when I was a kid always having BX93 - the country station out of London on all the time.  Then I kind of got away from country, but a couple years ago my wife and I were in the Yukon, and after spending 3 days hiking high ridges in Kluane, we went into Whitehorse for a night.  We got a hotel (and a shower) and asked the girl at the front desk where we should eat and she said Klondike Rib & Salmon BBQ, just around the corner.  The place looked really cool, made up like a trappers cabin inside, with canvas ceiling and walls, looks of ""Yukon-y"" decor.  We ordered the halibut chowder and caribou stew.  Both were out of this world.  While we were eating, I became aware of the music playing in the background and I knew I'd heard it before. I asked our waitress what it was, and she brought over the CD case - Waylon!  Ever since, this CD has been on my playlist, and I listen to it almost every week.  Great road music."

Ok....it's not always smooth blues, there's lots of southern rock and blues mingled with jazz or swing but then when I want it to be a bit smoother, I choose Ronnie Earl and the Broadcasters.  I guess I have about 50 of their tunes.  I have about 1000 tunes on my computer and every now and then, I change the tunes in my MP3.  I play the MP3 through the stereo system of my vehicule.  I have classed most of my tunes into different catégories (slow, fast, etc), old rock, early metal, and there are a bunch of tunes classed by what key they are in because I often play harmonica along with the tunes and I don't have to change harmonicas or search for the right harmonica for certain tunes."

422952,dave524,2010-01-16 13:26:00,4508,My three fav driving songs  Steppenwolf  - Born to be Wild  Golden Earring - Radar Love  Commander Cody and the Lost Planet Airmen - Hotrod Lincoln  All three guaranteed to get the pedal a little closer to the metal
422953,Rizzo,2010-01-16 13:45:00,4754,RAMONES or Offspring or 60's music
