We weren't sure if she'd been spayed and waited to see if she'd go into heat.  Sure enough she did, and even though we kept a close eye on her and kept her in the house %90 of the time one of the neighborhood dogs got to her while Ginny and I were away.  So anyways, yesterday I helped her deliver 4 healthy, cute little puppies!  2 black girls, 1 yellow boy and 1 yellow girl.  It looks like we already have a home for 3 of them, with 1 left looking to be adopted.  Let me know if you're interested.  We're not looking to make any money off of them, we just want to find them a good home and cover our costs for having their shots and de-worming etc. taken care of.  Have a great weekend!                      Cheers, Ryan"

425018,DanD,2010-01-23 02:31:00,2223,This picture of your little nurse should be framed and hung up with pride.  It brought back a lot of memories of when my little girl was that size; sheâ€™s 24 now and away at law school. Thanks for bringing back some memories.  Dan.
425019,bigugli,2010-01-23 02:35:00,6138,Too cute. Reminds me of my daughter. At 2 she took a litter of kittens and placed them in the compartment of her Sesame st. bus to take them for a ride. Patches was just frantic.
425047,Joey,2010-01-23 04:29:00,9122,"Awwww, they're adorable, and so is your daughter.  I bet you can't tear her away from them at this point.  Joey"
425055,Handlebarz,2010-01-23 08:51:00,3790,Dang Ryan them are some great memory shots there we just picked up a new family member in November a male black lab he sure is great with the kids and smart as heck hope ya find a good home for the last one.  BTW When we went to get out pup I found it funny that the parent dogs were both choclate labs kinda funny that they can have different color pups before getting our dog I would not have believed it but sure enough.
425364,The Urban Fisherman,2010-01-24 17:23:00,2050,"Thanks for the nice reply's gang!  We had a home lined up for the boy (yellow male) but that has fallen through, so we now have 2 puppies looking to be adopted.  Please shoot me a PM if you're interested!  Dawg - it's just a short drive, you can be here and back in no time! He'll be ready to go between march 10th and 17th! haha  Cheers, Ryan"
425365,TJQ,2010-01-24 17:27:00,7806,Oh my!!!  bark bark!!!
425368,Sinker,2010-01-24 18:03:00,8692,"Fun times!!  Do you know what breed of dog the father is?  If I didn't just adopt Wyatt, I'd take one of them for sure. I'm trying to convince the wife we need a puppy too, so who knows!!  S."
425369,The Urban Fisherman,2010-01-24 18:10:00,2050,"lol good luck Sinker!  That seems to be the problem with most people who've asked about them.. ""I want to adopt one, but I have to talk to the wife, or the husband first"" hah  Dad is a Black Lab Cross - looks like a lab but has white paws, and Mom is a purebred Lab.  Cheers, Ryan"
