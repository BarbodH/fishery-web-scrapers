425179,Beans,2010-01-23 23:41:00,3339,  Yesterday and today...    Need I say anymore ???
425187,Greencoachdog,2010-01-23 23:51:00,8163,"Don't feel bad Beansy, I've been skunked the last 3 weeks in a row!!! My Shad are wimpy little farts and are still dying (as of yesterday), even though the water has warmed up to 45*F!  This is the last bite I got!   17 days ago.. seems like a lifetime!!!"
425188,Terry,2010-01-24 00:07:00,14456,what do you mean skunked  looks like you have enough greens on the ice for a heck of a salad
425212,bigugli,2010-01-24 01:02:00,6138,"That is a scary thought Beans. I've managed to avoid the white stripe, so far."
425251,phiphntek,2010-01-24 03:45:00,115,"Hey Beans, I grew up with summers (and winters) at the family cottage at Nogies Creek.How's the new fishing season on Pigeon ?"
425254,Beans,2010-01-24 03:49:00,3339, That's not weeds Terry...It is the spruce tree branch I used to mark the hole when I left yesterday...It got a bit chewed up when I reopened the hole with my spud this afternoon...
425255,irishfield,2010-01-24 03:50:00,26272,Don't know what you're doing wrong Norm ! Maybe you need to wear that instead of sitting on it !!  
425259,Greencoachdog,2010-01-24 03:58:00,8163,  That's a trophy bait if I ever saw one!
425260,Beans,2010-01-24 03:59:00,3339, Look up above...That should answer your question...So far I'm 0 for 3 trips since Jan 1st...Fortunately I don't have far to go...  I did hear that people were catching crappie over at Little Bald but I've spudded through my last 14 inches of ice for this season...
425262,phiphntek,2010-01-24 04:03:00,115,Thanks for the report.I thought the skunk might have been just for the dayWhereabouts you having not so good luck?
425266,Beans,2010-01-24 04:22:00,3339, North shore of Taite's Bay...There are no fish in Taite's Bay...the mucksies ate them all...
425268,phiphntek,2010-01-24 04:24:00,115,"yep, I do remeber those muskies"
425282,Big Cliff,2010-01-24 08:43:00,6899,"Not doing much better over here either Beans, got two small perch yesterday and one walleye."

425313,Jer,2010-01-24 13:55:00,1426,   I'm sure you know...3 x 0 is still 0...
425318,capt_hooked,2010-01-24 14:00:00,212,don't feel so bad Cliff...  at the E.!. office the line goes around the block...  sad looking fellows in gum boots and plaid jackets.......  many still holding on to their bent up fishing rods...  some carrying old bait buckets..   (the dream never dies) occasionally one spots an old tattered OFC hat among the crowd...  its a horrific scene...
425370,Beans,2010-01-24 18:17:00,3339,   Nice to see you on board Capt...How's miss Leslie?
425403,Sinker,2010-01-24 20:30:00,8692,"Hey Beansie, if you want, you can go to work for me, and I'll spend my days getting skunked.  Really..........I don't mind"
425428,Beans,2010-01-24 21:57:00,3339, I'm sure you wouldn't mind Shane...  Depends on what you do...  All my life I was too light for heavy work... Now I'm too heavy for light work !!!  Dang it all !!!
