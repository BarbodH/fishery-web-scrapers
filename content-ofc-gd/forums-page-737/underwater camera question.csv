424837,FisherMike,2010-01-22 18:39:00,108,im just wondering what if anything you guys use to hold the camera in place underwater.  i just got a camera off a buddy of mine and ive only played with it a few times.  for me it just seemed like a bit of a hassle trying to get the camera to stay aimed at one spot.  i saw a product somewhere online the other day but cant find it anywhere now.  it is a black disk with slots in it that you can feed the cord through to hold the cam in place.  has any one heard of these or used one??  any info would be great.  id like to use the cam a bit more but it gets annoying and im more than happy just staring at my humminbird.  thanks
424839,wallyboss,2010-01-22 18:45:00,1095,"I made one myself .  Just take the cover off of a plastic bucket, cut a slit in it, then use a pistol grip clamp to hold the able going to the camera and all you have to do is hold on to teh plastic cover and turn the clamp around. I try to figure out where the camera is pointing then I just clamp it accordingly so I know where the camera is pointing all the time."
424855,rpsmith,2010-01-22 19:24:00,28,Its called the compass and cabela's sells it.  It works great for me!  Cheap and they deliver quick.
424859,Dara,2010-01-22 19:33:00,3052,You gotta go down with it and aim it
424874,Terry,2010-01-22 19:55:00,14456,I use the compass and it works great    it would be simple to make one oh and it keeps the hole from freezing over   somewhat

424932,Terry,2010-01-22 22:07:00,14456,"yeah, without a doubt the remote controlled the Mo-Pod is great"
424938,Big Cliff,2010-01-22 22:18:00,6899,I just put a tie wrap arounf the cable and the hole near the tail. Camera points straight down so you can see what direction fish are coming in from etc. Works perfect for me and I like to have the camera suspended above my bait.
424978,camillj,2010-01-23 00:06:00,1988,I agree with Cliff ... nothing like watching your minnow wiggle just before a hit ....
