989619,captpierre,2016-12-29 13:26:00,2521,Noticed on FB that Rapala sells to the public on line. Sale on now. I bet the retailers like that.

989626,Steve,2016-12-29 14:50:00,2075,"prices for the high end rapala trolling rods are higher than what Bills Bait sells them for.....and I doubt the pricing on the site includes shipping....  but I guess if you can catch one on sale, that would be worth it."
989638,OhioFisherman,2016-12-29 17:56:00,6623,I think a lot of manufacturers will sell direct to the public.  Berkley has a site  http://www.ffo-tackle.com/ffo-reels/  Lurenet also  http://www.lurenet.com/lures/crankbaits
989645,misfish,2016-12-29 21:08:00,29133,"Just checked a few items I want. There are cheaper prices at the stores. Rapala ice rods are more. The rapala ice reel is more. Add shipping and tax and it,s way more."
989829,Shloim,2017-01-02 12:15:00,515,I get email from them and they had the pants I just bought on sale for black friday. They were on sale for more than I paid at Angling Outfitters. If I wasn't so lazy I'd unsubscribe... Happy NY y'all!!!
989837,buick14,2017-01-02 13:58:00,741,Yup those prices are terrible I'm sure the retailers feel happy when Rapala sells directly to the public with those prices
989838,EC1,2017-01-02 14:13:00,930,"I just bought a set of auger blades from them even though my blades are still fine. But yes, the rest of the prices aren't realistic"
989934,Rustic-Fisher,2017-01-03 17:25:00,826,"A little off topic ..... Just went to the Oshawa head office to see about having my manual  Finnbore auger handle replaced as it had sheared off last year after the 8th time out . Paid full pop for a new one and was told to be a little more ""gentle""  next time by the secretary  . Customer service was amoung the worst I've seen in the industry .  Not surprised one bit the prices are inflated directly from them ."
