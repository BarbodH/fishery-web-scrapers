990130,pike slayer,2017-01-05 02:16:00,1177,I have a 2016 polaris sportsman 450. I was thinking of getting a set of tracks for it. Track companies are claiming you can get tracks for atvs down to 300cc and they are suppose to run fine when geared properly. I only get out ice fishing 4-5times a year and insurance for my old beater sled being around $400 for the year doesn't seem worth it $100 a trip. I read online that they are super slow but unstoppable and I don't care to win any races. And that the tracks clog up with slush and ice. Can't you just chip it out like a sled? So continue paying insurance on my beater or get a set of tracks? I plan on picking up a used set. Ppl are asking around $2500 used.
990138,Joeytier,2017-01-05 04:37:00,3990,"If all you wanna do is run across lakes, then I see their use.  They seem to work well in deep snow, but they absolute destroy every trail they touch, fuel economy will be awful and it will be pretty gutless on that 450 motor.  Sure that's the best price you can get for insuring an old sled?"
990140,Sinker,2017-01-05 04:38:00,8692,400 for a year on a beater is at least twice what you should be paying for your sled.  S.
990151,myot,2017-01-05 13:18:00,131,They work awesome on large cc machines 500+ we tried to get a 700 Grizzly stuck for hours once in 7'+ of snow and couldn't but they do chew up a lot of power and make your machine hard on fuel  Dan
990152,Terry,2017-01-05 13:26:00,14456,The older tracks are too hard on smaller atvs But newer tracks gives you smaller sprockets for smaller machines. The only problem with that is. Most tracks limit you to 65% of topend   But with a smaller sprocket. It can be 40%. So if your machine did 100k your topend would be 40k. At full throttle and no one would run at full throttle so your cruising speed would be about 25 k.   If that is good enough. Then tracks are the way to go
990153,John Bacon,2017-01-05 13:29:00,3277,Are you able to get a good deal on second hand ones?  I don't think you will saving any money if buy new ones.
990253,pike slayer,2017-01-06 00:38:00,1177,The new 450 is actually a 570 tuned for lower end torque. Not sure what's more important torque or hp. And ya I can do about 50-55mph with tires and I figured I'd go probably half that speed. There's newer style set for sale locally for $2500
990255,ecmilley,2017-01-06 02:49:00,2163,2500 buys lots of insurance. My yamaha apex is 400 a year be shopping that around. Everything a tradeoff not.gonna.beat the sled for deep snow and.speed atvs great in low.snow.
990274,porkpie,2017-01-06 13:55:00,2521,You should be able to find insurance for half that for a beater.  I get a discount thorough my employment but I only pay $312 a year for a 2005 ATV and a 1998 snowmobile.
990275,BillM,2017-01-06 14:05:00,17367,$2500 buys a snowmobile that will do way better in those conditions.
990276,moose,2017-01-06 14:25:00,266,"I had a 2003 arctic 500 cc 4x4 atv I had tjd tracks for it cost Close to 4000$ I found every yr I was putting rear wheel bearing every yr I was told by dealer it's like putting your emergency brake on car and driving ,makes a lot of torque on rear end and bearing I just sold and bought new atv but wouldn't put tracks on"
990277,LeXXington,2017-01-06 14:26:00,1928,"I went for the tracks for my 450. They are geared specifically for the bike.  I went back and forth on what to get. My main reasons for going for the tracks.  Never getting stuck these things are like a tank.  Don't want to test it in slush but from what I have watched it should be able to get out. They raise your bike extra so you get lots of extra clearance Your footprint is very wide,  The docs say reduce your weight distribution  One toy to maintain One toy to pay for insurance One toy to find storage  I wont be winning any races but that ok for me. I have not found my top speed yet .. Deep snow slows you down and no snow is bumpy  If I lived close to the lake and had the room for storage I would have both an ATV and Sled.  If I lived up north maybe just a sled.  Storage was a issue for me and I had to choose."
990283,myot,2017-01-06 16:24:00,131,There is no $2500 sled around that will come even close to a good ATV with tracks in deep snow. Mind you if your after speed tracks on an ATV is definitely not the ticket  Dan
990299,Dara,2017-01-06 20:52:00,3052,Don't even think about taking it on a groomed trail. If thats the only way to your lake snowmobilers will burn it
990305,manitoubass2,2017-01-06 21:19:00,11391,"I looked at an atv with tracks in the spring. Almost bought it but I sat and pondered the idea for a few days and decided against it.  I want use out of a machine and multi function if possible. I didnt really see that with tracks  I like my older sleds, but if I get anything else its going to be a ""gator"" style atv with multiple functions. Yeah the price goes up 10 fold, but I use these machines alot and they are def. Worth it IMO.  The cool thing about a gator is you could really do some killer back lake fishing. Almost nothing will get one stuck if your reasonable  They are surprisingly good on gas too. A tank lasts over 30 hours of use.  In your case id stick to a snowmobile"
990325,pike slayer,2017-01-06 23:41:00,1177,I unfortunately don't have a garage yet just a large shed and a lean to for now. I bought a 2003 polaris rmk 700 8 years ago for $2000. I drove it for 3 years and sold it for $2500 thinking I'd buy something newer and well life got in the way and didn't buy another sled until last winter. I bought a beater that I don't trust one bit. Now years later I can't find a 03 rmk for under $2500 the prices of sleds have sky rocketed. My atv is a brand new reliable machine and which is why I was thinking tracks for it. I plan on keeping the wheeler for many years so tracks seems like a good investment. Although I was searching the depths of the Internet and ppl are saying a plow won't fit with tracks on so I'm feeling stumped right now.
990326,manitoubass2,2017-01-06 23:47:00,11391,"That makes sense.  If thats the route you choose.  Almost anyone could weld an extension for a plow.  Ask any buds that weld, even if not professionally  I did it on a skid steer, made an extension 10ft long to get under tail pullies, and in all honesty I have no clue how to weld professionally"
990329,LeXXington,2017-01-07 00:37:00,1928,ppl are saying a plow won't fit with tracks on so I'm feeling stumped right now.  Guess I better take my plow kit that has the extension to work with tracks back
990330,pike slayer,2017-01-07 01:22:00,1177,Ya I just found an extension on the polaris website for the polaris tracks and plow. Lexington is your 4wheeler the sportsman 450?
990414,LeXXington,2017-01-08 02:42:00,1928,Ya I just found an extension on the polaris website for the polaris tracks and plow. Lexington is your 4wheeler the sportsman 450? Yamaha 450.  No problem plowing the driveway with the tracks.. Turning radius is crap but beats doing a 50 foot driveway by hand
990429,singingdog,2017-01-08 13:12:00,1047,"Get the right tracks for your ATV, or it's a nightmare. We groom trail with a tracked Grizzly and it's a beast: pulls great, steers great. It eats gas compared to a snowmobile, and is waaaay colder to ride."
