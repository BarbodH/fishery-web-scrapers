989948,TheTallPolak,2017-01-03 19:28:00,26,"Good Morning Gentlemen (and women) of OFC!  I was out Icefishing at Frenchmans Bay on Saturday Night (New Years Eve)  I am glad to report that the Ice was decent up until 5 FOW (5"" or more), but suddenly drops to 1"" beyond that.  After our scouting and concluding our fishing, one of my friends left behind my Auger and Spud (FinBore III in 8"" and a black Rapala Spud).  If anyone is in the area and has seen it please dont hesitate to contact me!  Cheers."

990161,TheTallPolak,2017-01-05 15:18:00,26,"Aha, My Finbore was brand spanking new! Only had it for one season, and of that one season only took it out a few times!  I've never had any issues with it so I don't see why someone else would! ... I wouldn't mind if someone complained about finding my shiny new blue auger... Maybe the colour is not to their liking or the manual auger is too much work for them to handle!  If that's the case I will gladly accept it back!"

990202,huzzsaba,2017-01-05 21:08:00,884,So.........did you catch anything??
990211,TheTallPolak,2017-01-05 21:34:00,26,"We had no luck in Frenchmans Bay, the ice we were one was about 6 inches (at the time) but dropped off significantly (to 1 inch) around the 5 feet of water mark.  We had some tip ups setup but no luck!  The day after on a northern lake we managed to catch over 50 perch (total) of which 12 made it to the table!"

990234,Weeds,2017-01-05 22:57:00,782,I believe Frenchmens bay was once kind of a hot spot for big pike through the ice. Still the case?

990239,GBW,2017-01-05 23:17:00,8460,"I believe Frenchmens bay was once kind of a hot spot for big pike through the ice. Still the case? More of a lazy spot.  By that I mean you drive up to it and walk 6' and try your luck. All the salt, sand and other garbage off the 401 and near by drains into there so the ice there is never ever safe also"
990244,Rustic-Fisher,2017-01-05 23:35:00,826,"LMAO, Good luck to them . Hope it turns up for you."
990250,John Bacon,2017-01-06 00:03:00,3277,"More of a lazy spot.  By that I mean you drive up to it and walk 6' and try your luck. All the salt, sand and other garbage off the 401 and near by drains into there so the ice there is never ever safe also  Plenty of safe ice on the west side of the bay during a cold winter.  The east side never used to freeze at all, but since they built those peers out into Lake Ontario that side has been freezing too.  But, I am not sure how safe the ice on the east side is.  I have caught a few pike and perch; but I have not had great luck there."
990263,fishermccann,2017-01-06 04:46:00,655,"Last year I was on Frenchmans Bay to see personally, some fishermen caught.. a 40 inch pike, a 4 lb rainbow , a 12 inch crappie, a 5 lb bowfin  and the usual perch and white bass. These were not all on the same day, but they were all in 2016, on the ice."
990269,TheTallPolak,2017-01-06 11:55:00,26,"I know there are some ""wandering gators"" in there, being so close to Duffins I cant see why you wouldn't get any Trout there either.  I am not sure what the current Ice report there is but we were in about 6 inches of ice, since then the ice was completely destroyed! The last few couple days might have built up some ice though."
990295,fishermccann,2017-01-06 20:21:00,655,"I am down on the bay 3-4 times a week from now till ice out. I only fish once a week or so though. I just go down with the dog, to reconnoitre. Say hi if you see me and the dog, a very friendly Golden Retriever, named Oakley."
990301,porkpie,2017-01-06 21:06:00,2521,"Simcoe, January 2014.  Still waiting as well lol.  You've been waiting much longer!"
990307,TheTallPolak,2017-01-06 21:28:00,26,"Aha, good thing this forum isn't a returning items as first come first serve! Or else I may be waiting quite some time!!"
