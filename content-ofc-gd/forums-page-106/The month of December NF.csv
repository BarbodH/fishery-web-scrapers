989512,Rodbender,2016-12-26 15:29:00,1027,On December 2nd my wife texted me she was at her Dr's and he sent her to a heart specialist who in turn told her to go to Centenary Hospital in Scarbrough. When I got home she came in just after me and looked fine and told me it was too much for her so she stayed home. Next morning were up having coffee she looks fine I'm off with the camera 20 mins later I get a text from her she wants to go to emerg no time to tell the guysI have to go. I'm gone home pick her up and in 45 mins have her at ajax emerg. they put the heart monitors on and tell her she there till monday when they will transport her to Centenary. 11pm saturday night get a text from the SIL saying she (My wife) is going to sign herself out back to the hospital to talk her outta that Monday she's off to Centenary for a catheter after the pics she needs 4 Stents 2 that day to open and artery that was 99% blocked. All went well and she was back home tuesday by noon but need to back for 2 more December 19th. Yes she had a Heart Attack they don't know when or how she worked through it!! well she has them in place and doing great it was a wake up call for both of us. We are both eating better and quitting smoking we are already down aprox 6 cartons of smokes in the last 3 weeks yes we smoked alot we should be smoke free in about 3 weeks anyway she is doing great

989518,misfish,2016-12-26 17:15:00,29133,"We ALL, never expect things to happen like this. When they do, thats when we change our ways. It,s human nature.  Glad to hear she is fine and still with you.  Keep on the straight and narrow bud."
989519,crappieperchhunter,2016-12-26 17:17:00,2582,"Scary stuff. You both have been given the gift of a second chance at living a longer life by making healthier choices. Don't squander it.  It sounds like your not, and I'm happy to hear that. Carry on and make 2017 and beyond great years."
989563,Ralph Field,2016-12-27 14:13:00,1018,"I was able to quit smoking with the help of Chantrix . I had an Angiogram in August to deal with suspected blockages, but they didn't find any. I hope your wife does well and that the two of you are able to quit smoking which isn't easy without some type of help."
989564,npt1,2016-12-27 14:33:00,220,"Good going for you both, kicking the habit is the best thing in the world. I smoked for  35 years,  stopped it when my first grand child was born, I figured she should have a chance to have a Grampa in her life,  best thing I ever did. Being smoke free is wonderful, You just wait and see. Congrats."

989583,Big Cliff,2016-12-28 09:49:00,6899,"Well I sure am glad it worked out the way it did for you and your wife, Merry Christmas no matter what else happens eh. Sue had her first heart attack and a quad bypass 23 tears ago, she's 70 now but doesn't look it or act it. She works hard at taking care of herself, she eats healthy and gets plenty of exercise when she can.  Quitting smoking is a big first step,! Don't try to do it on your own, go see your Dr. they can help you with Champix (SP)  (or one of the other alternatives) and they are covered by OHIP. They make it so easy to quit you won't even know you are.  Good luck and if you or your wife (yes it's hard on both parties) ever want to talk to someone that's been there, just say the word!  All the best in 2017"

Aug 1 I weighed 216 lbs, then I stopped eating fried foods, deep fried dinners, eliminated junk food such as chips, pop, chocolate bars & cut out ALL desserts.  Today I'm 193 lbs & feel much better.  Good luck!"
