990204,lew,2017-01-05 21:14:00,12766,In the last hour I've had 7 deer and 3 turkeys show up for something to eat and I always get a kick out of watching them share the trough and even make room for each other.  You'd almost think they were buds        
990205,misfish,2017-01-05 21:15:00,29133,Awesome Lew. I got to get up to pops and take some pics of his heard.
990207,crappieperchhunter,2017-01-05 21:16:00,2582,Love it Lew.  I'd never get tired of seeing that in my yard.
990209,Tomcat,2017-01-05 21:25:00,395,That's pretty special Lew. Thanks for sharing.
990210,lew,2017-01-05 21:30:00,12766,"Thanks boys, glad to hear you enjoy seeing these guys as much as I do.  Last night just before sunset I had a deer in the yard with the biggest set of antlers I've ever seen on a deer but there wasn't enough light for a picture.  Sure hope I can get a good picture of him before he drops the antlers.  That lad was a true trophy...at least to me anyways."
990268,DanD,2017-01-06 10:46:00,2223,Great pictures Lew!  If you want to attract more deer and give them something beneficial to their health; put out a mineral salt lick.  http://www.tscstores.com/2KG-TRACE-MINERAL-SALT-LICK-P8755.aspx#.WG9zzlUrKM8  It supposedly helps with mussel and bone growth and it satisfies their want for salt.  Dan.
990272,Fish Farmer,2017-01-06 13:31:00,2234,"Thanks for sharing Lew, you're a lucky man to have such a live nature show in the back yard. But I still can't believe you gave up fishin"
990273,manitoubass2,2017-01-06 13:52:00,11391,Thats an awesome view!  If you follow dans advice with a salt lick your gonna have ALOT more deer visiting and over a few years theyll be noticeably larger
990278,farsider,2017-01-06 14:27:00,456,Thanks Lew!  Beautiful setup you got there.  All the best for the new year!  Mark
990284,outllaw,2017-01-06 16:43:00,1232,thanks lew for the look. I enjoy all of it.. .
990286,OhioFisherman,2017-01-06 17:27:00,6623,Great pics! looks like a quieter group than my former in laws!
990287,manitoubass2,2017-01-06 17:42:00,11391,Lol
990289,lew,2017-01-06 17:47:00,12766,"Yeah, these guys are pretty laid back Paul LOL  As for the salt, I put a block out 2 years ago and they didn't seen the least bit interested and by the end of the winter it still looked almost new.  Maybe I'll grab another one and see if they like it."
990294,Rodbender,2017-01-06 20:05:00,1027,nice Lew throw out a brown block instead of the blue one
990336,Big Cliff,2017-01-07 08:42:00,6899,"Beautiful Pictures Lew, how many bags of corn do you go through in a winter?"
990338,lew,2017-01-07 10:23:00,12766,A bag of feed is 50 pounds and lasts about 2 days Cliff but if the weather is nasty I put out extra.
990341,Big Cliff,2017-01-07 12:32:00,6899,I would almost think that qualifies you as a farmer LOL. Good on you Lew!
990342,lew,2017-01-07 12:59:00,12766,"Thanks Cliff, it's just something I enjoy doing, guess you could call it a hobby.....a very expensive hobby LOL"
990348,SirCranksalot,2017-01-07 13:58:00,3291,"Great pics! looks like a quieter group than my former in laws!  Wouldn't they be up in the trees??  I never get tired of seeing deer no matter how many I've seen. Beautiful animal. The 1 great pic I missed was of several deer happily munching just on the right side of a 'No Hunting"" sign."

The 1 great pic I missed was of several deer happily munching just on the right side of a 'No Hunting"" sign.   LOL! The farmer behind me used to lease land to farm all around my area, one spot was right across the road. I could get up in the morning and see 20 - 30 deer grazing in the field after the harvest, sometimes they appeared again towards evening, homes there now and the deer scattered."
990430,Rizzo,2017-01-08 13:30:00,4754,awesome pics would love to live in a place like that some day!

Its been almost 40 years since I've lived in the country and the older I get the more I miss it. Both my kids have both moved out to the country; I'm so envious when they tell me how many deer and other wildlife that they get to come visit. Oh well someday I may talk my wife into selling and moving?????? Please keep posting your encounters; I very much enjoy the pics.  Dan.
