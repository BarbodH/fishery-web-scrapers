Dutch, hes from Michigan now residing in Canada(due to legal reasons)  Billm, that is absolutely correct. You are only allowed to use your status card for fishing or hunting in tour treaty area, otherwise a liscense is required and MNR laws are applicable to said individual.  Off topic abit but some of the treaty areas are friggen huge! Treaty 3 is where we fall, look it up, its quite large"

990221,Terry,2017-01-05 22:22:00,14456,"now you're just making stuff up with out a doubt the guy is a moron and most likely a racist i believe I clearly stated i have a problem and think i said i was glad to see the cops involved, but sure make up you own story  and the last while  i was talking about other operators not this goof  any any operator has the right to set any rules he wants   as to limits  drinking and as in fly in many will not let you take any fish home they tell you before you go and if you don't like it you don't book with them and that is the way it is you must follow their rules. and of course they can't be racist"
990235,manitoubass2,2017-01-05 23:02:00,11391,"Ok. Not sure what hit a nerve there.  Im well aware you stated hes an idiot and possibly racist, which I obviously agree with.  It rubbed me the wrong way that you stated it was just poorly worded. Makes it sound your ok with that, whether you are or are not.  Sort if like how it was brought up that I only seen to care when it involves indiginous people.  Thats just how I viewed your comment, and obviously how brian views my content in certain matters.  I also agreed with you that iperators could indeed set rules. My only point was in many cases they cannot enforce them legally. Sure they can bar you the individual from using their services but thats about it.  What I mean is this.  Im native(which I am not, just for case and point) I pay an outfitter to fly me to a fishing location. Their rules state no alcohol and no fish over a sporting license.  So I sneak a bottle on board and get hammed fishing. Oufitter finds out and does what? Leaves me on a secluded island to die? Or I keep 6 fish instead of 4, he wont allow two of 6 on his plane. Again, what else can he do? Leave me on a secluded island to die? He can disallow thise fish from coming on his plane and no longer allow me to use their services. Thats about it. Maybe spread the word to other outfitters too I suppose.  I ran into a similar issue with my fishing derby. Although rules didnt allow you to keep fish, many did, legally. All I could do was disqualigy them from the derby. It was also a no alcohol event, I barred 3 or 4 more from drinking during the event. Thats all I could do.  I am NOT calling you a racist and I most certainly not making anything up."

Had he said all persons asked to never or not return due to what ever reason *as Terry said drunk and personally banned from said company* a whole different topic. ""White bucket"" YES it has a stigma to Asian people BUT when I go ice fishing I use one to keep my stuff safe.  True 100% that most hear that and or read it and think Asain.  Sad but true. Some places in the world do have a catch and keep mentality no matter the size due to culture and this is why the Reg's are not printed in more than just English.  Education!

990126,Dutch01,2017-01-05 01:32:00,1431,"I've seen a number of references to this guy having a right to choose who he permits to frequent his business. I just want to clarify that this is not entirely accurate.  If he were to say:  ""All patrons are expected to follow the Ontario regulations while using our huts.""  Or  ""No alcohol, profanity or disturbing other guests""  He would be in the clear.  However, he specifically stated in advance he will not serve holders of a status card. It can be assumed that holding a status card identifies one as belonging to a visible minority. It is illegal to refuse to provide services on the basis of race. Therefore, he is in contravention of the law.  If a status card holder is refused service on that basis, he or she need only call the Ontario Human Rights Tribunal and he is in big trouble. That's no joke, they have as much or more power as the court. (imo they have too much power, but that is another post altogether!)."

I also was understanding that it was totally illegal to ban individuals of a certain race from your business regardless of your reasoning.  Now i have my confirmation, thanks."
990159,Terry,2017-01-05 14:30:00,14456,with out a doubt the guy is a moron and most likely a racist  but when other operators state that everyone using their huts or flyin services must follow the sport licence  or con  licence limits the only people who can do otherwise are people with a status card so without them sounding racist they have done the exact same thing
990172,manitoubass2,2017-01-05 16:54:00,11391,"Think of it however you want Terry, illegal is illegal. Blatant racism is blatant racism. And apperently Canada has two Ministers of Natural Resources. One just happens to be an ex convinct from michigan running an ice hut rental business on the side with no licensing, the ither probably does most of her work from an office in Peterborough?"
990173,Terry,2017-01-05 17:11:00,14456,Think of it however you want no i was just telling it like it is at many business*  not sure where you were going with your post  so i will not visit this thread any  more
990175,manitoubass2,2017-01-05 17:23:00,11391," Happens up here too. Probably the one that gets abused moreso than anything is no alcohol. But almost everyone I know violates that rule. Worst they can do is call the authorities and or ban you from their services  If someone possesses a status card and keeps 6 fish instead of 4, there is nothing you can do legally to enforce your rule. Thats just how it is.  And I find it disturbing you have little issue with this guys actions other than he should have worded it better.  Come on man"
990176,BillM,2017-01-05 17:25:00,17367,"Facebook is serious business.  If the guy had half a brain he could have gotten his point across without ruffling any feathers.  But he didn't, lol.  Too funny.  Rick: Question for ya.  If you fish outside your treaty territory, aren't you required to have a valid Ontario fishing license and follow the regs (be it sport or con)?"
990177,Dutch01,2017-01-05 17:39:00,1431," My personal recommendation is to keep in mind the wisdom of Buddha:  ""Holding on to anger at someone is like drinking poison and expecting them to die""  This guy will get what's coming to him one day, in the meantime stop drinking the poison.

Nothing was said about the ""white bucket "" and IMO, the education on limits and fish kept has come along way since this whole "" white bucket"" thing came about.  If I may, I would think, what this operator was trying to make accross ( although he might of had bad experinces that we dont know of ) and feel free to correct me if Im wrong Rick, is that status card holders have no set limits ( yes/ no ) So, he as the operator wants to keep the lake, his area, to a regulated fish keep limit slot size what ever. Where as a card holder has no limit and can catch and keep everything.  In no way am I against what the laws allow for both sides. Only trying to figure out what happen to makes this become personal to him.  The way it got advertised is wrong, but IMO, we need to look at both sides. YES/NO ?"
990089,manitoubass2,2017-01-04 22:17:00,11391,He cannot impose his own set of laws on a specific race.  He is operating without proper licensing.

There is no law, that says he has to allow anyone he dosent want fishing in his hut. I have seen it here many times.  Once a group showed up to fish at a local hut operator. No word of a lie, he told them straight up, I told you I would not rent to you any longer. Why? Because they trashed one of his huts, drunk and well, the rest that follows like, disrupting all the hut renters out there. Thats his right, as the owner and operator."
990093,AKRISONER,2017-01-04 22:31:00,5558,"He cannot impose his own set of laws on a specific race.  He is operating without proper licensing.  this pretty much sums it up.  You have to remember that indigenous folks have been handed the right to fish as they do by our very own lawmakers. To impose your own rule where folks are unable to access your business because they maintain certain rights is wrong on every level.  Here it is put very very plainly...women have the right to freedom of speech. You as a business owner can disagree with this law and believe that women should be treated as sub human and therefore you ban all women from your business in the chance that they may express their opinion.  sounds a bit friggin ridiculous doesn't it? well there you go  he has every right to ban them...but that also makes him a racist, just as a person who believes women shouldnt talk is a sexist."

You know many of the ""white bucket brigade"" posts are started or followed with ""well in their own country"" type posts. Thats insinuating a race or culture. Im not saying you said that but many have, thus what Ive said. But yeah, to myself and group of friends that generally refers to ""poaching"" or keeping OS fish or above legal limits.  Also, this individual from Michigan claims outright he is the ""honourable Minister of Natural Resources"". Does that help?  He also posts openly about sexually violating individuals of a certain race, and cutting nets or burning boats etc."

989990,manitoubass2,2017-01-04 02:01:00,11391,"I appreciate the warning Terry!  And in my experience everyone is treated equal.  So my bum kissing isnt gonna get me far lol.  Im posting pics ""as is"" for members to read.  So if I get banned for that its of my own doing"
989993,GBW,2017-01-04 02:15:00,8460,This is how I read it...

989999,GBW,2017-01-04 02:49:00,8460,I shoulda put a ring on it... BAAAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHA
990015,Sterling,2017-01-04 12:41:00,477,"@manitoubass  Those posts about shoving things seem fake. Maybe I'm wrong, but they just strike me as fake.  Plus I ran a search on those youtube addresses and the dates don't jive."
990018,manitoubass2,2017-01-04 13:14:00,11391, Not even sure what his motives are? But its apperent hes an idiot.  Im not gonna post what was sent to me as this guy is up to his neck legally speaking.  Doesnt effect me one way or another but id stay away from this company if your in the area.
990019,AKRISONER,2017-01-04 13:25:00,5558,"just throwing this out there...my experience with fishing guides, and others in the fishing industry has been ridiculously hit or miss. Disturbingly the large majority of the time it has been a miss though.  Its one thing to know how to fish, but if you are a weirdo, I do not want to spend money to spend the day hanging out with you or giving you my business. My buddy just had an experience on erie 2 months ago where the guide has his wife drive the boat and the whole time the dude was calling his wife fat amognst other things...how are these folks in business still?"
990020,manitoubass2,2017-01-04 13:26:00,11391,Hes getting called out hard on facebook and has zero issues posting his rascist rants.  He isnt leaving much to the imagination
990023,Sterling,2017-01-04 13:30:00,477,Those posts maybe. But hes been in direct contact with my friend that works for the ministry of natural resources and hes sending the gnarliest crap. And its two people not just one.  Not even sure what his motives are? But its apperent hes an idiot.  Im not gonna post what was sent to me as this guy is up to his neck legally speaking.  Doesnt effect me one way or another but id stay away from this company if your in the area.  Definitely an idiot and I'd never do business with him. Just think if we're going to crucify the guy it should be over true crimes
990024,manitoubass2,2017-01-04 13:30:00,11391," Unfortunately its relitively easy to be a fishing guide. But alot of them are doing it just for easy money.  Others are hardcore passionate anglers that take extreme pride in not only putting you on fish, but making it fun doing so.  Ive guided in a pinch and I can tell you my main goals.  Put you on fish, hopefully big fish.  Teach as much as I can  Make your day memorable and enjoyable  Make sure you eat well  Return to shore safely"
990026,wormdunker,2017-01-04 14:36:00,1711,"Wow!  I can't believe what this guy wrote to ""advertise"" his business??  My guess would be he wants a very quiet winter!  To advertise a no status card policy is inviting the locals to burn down his  house, business & his fish huts.  Why is he not operating on Nosbonsing this year?  ""Political reasons""??  He probably has brand new huts this year cuz the natives burnt his down last year.  LOL!"
990028,manitoubass2,2017-01-04 14:56:00,11391,I wouldnt doubt it^^^
990029,Sterling,2017-01-04 15:06:00,477,"@manitoubass  Looks like the post was real, based on my latest investigations  Signed covert agent Sterling, over."
990030,manitoubass2,2017-01-04 15:23:00,11391,Lol.  Looks like hes already been visited by authorities after some local news/radio stations have picked up the story.  Im genuinly curious what police will say about some guy claiming on facebook and his kijijii adds that he not only owns icehutrentals.ca but hes the minster of natural resources.  I dont think thats a wise thing to do lol
