989802,Meegs,2017-01-02 01:01:00,249,Well it was a great start to 2017. I haven't touched a rod since August. Way too long. Anyways turned out to be a great start to the year. We managed to land double digit numbers of Whitefish and even managed a Laker to end the day. Forgot my jacket in the truck so was a bit chilly. Got fish on 5 different colors of jigs today. Found them in 87 to 92 fow.  Was tough jigging in the white caps at times but was a fun few hours out.   
989804,Terry,2017-01-02 01:12:00,14456,you're killing me  nice catch
989807,Moosebunk,2017-01-02 01:17:00,3970,you're killing me  nice catch  What he said!  James... you got us jonzing!  Some great fishing and feel required from a rocking boat for whiteys at those depths. Well done again!
989809,wormdunker,2017-01-02 01:57:00,1711,"Thanx for reporting.  Strange - I had to look twice when I saw the pic of your truck & boat in the driveway, with all that snow!"
989813,msp,2017-01-02 02:59:00,1336,Awesome
989816,GBW,2017-01-02 03:20:00,8460,very nice!
989817,Joeytier,2017-01-02 03:56:00,3990,"Awesome, great job.  Figured Simcoe would have had a skim by now at least."
989819,Acountdeleted,2017-01-02 04:00:00,2562,Woah! Great haul!
989825,wkrp,2017-01-02 10:18:00,656,Why wernt we all invited to the party.?
989835,davey buoy,2017-01-02 12:43:00,5505,"Whooda thought January?,nice haul !!!!!!!"
989846,Carp,2017-01-02 17:15:00,1488,Sweet !
989851,misfish,2017-01-02 18:01:00,29133,"Sweet dude.  Thanks for the call. Rethinking now, I should of went out today.  How did ya make out?  Lots of guys out this morning."
989856,Old Ironmaker,2017-01-02 18:15:00,8243,"I hate writing ""nice fish"" over and over so I am going to say Fantasmic. Is it legal to use the ""ice fishing"" grip on the rod even if there isn't any ice?  Do you have snow tires on the trailer? I towed the boat in the snow once and will never do that again, ever. A nightmare when a storm hit on the 400."
989858,misfish,2017-01-02 18:34:00,29133,"We are all 5-10 minutes, from Simcoe launches.  Alot of toon launches, are even closer."
989864,Freshtrax,2017-01-02 19:19:00,2215,Great way to ring in the new year !
989871,Old Ironmaker,2017-01-02 19:38:00,8243,"Hey Brian, Happy New year bud. I have done much damage in 5 miles driving. I totalled a car 4 doors from where I lived once."
989877,Meegs,2017-01-02 21:58:00,249,I'm 6 min from the launch and I got good new rubber on the trailer. Not much snow if any on the roads.. just the ramp.
989885,akaShag,2017-01-03 00:31:00,2073,"Absolutely, positively, freakin' INCREDIBLE.  I did three double takes when I saw the boat and open water.  Unbelievable.  and AWESOME.  Well done!!!!  Doug  (wishing I still lived down that way reading this report...............)"
989895,manitoubass2,2017-01-03 05:28:00,11391,Wow!
989905,SirCranksalot,2017-01-03 14:34:00,3291,"Alot of toon launches, are even closer.  So what's your excuse for not being out in your toon?? You don't plan on having any more kids anyway, do you??"
