Fortunately I managed to get out on Monday after a shift was cancelled,  headed up the road,  set up my shack,  and was treated to some clear ice lake trout fun,  only small, but got rid of the stench of the dreaded skunk!         Happy New Year to you ALL!   Simon."

990053,Acountdeleted,2017-01-04 18:56:00,2562,Awesome haul. This makes me want to go after lakers so bad. But the lakes I target em either aren't safe or aren't open yet.
990121,Jds63,2017-01-05 00:16:00,1365,Incredible ice ... like fishing in an aquarium looks like a sweet setup ... the sled and the hut !!!
