990561,misfish,2017-01-09 16:53:00,29133,"I have the handle with me, JUST encase. Just undo the butterfly bolt, remove and put the handle on. I leave the second battery at home. Have yet to have a need for it. Like I said, I left the auger outside on Saturday. when I got home, put the battery on the charger. would not charge as it was still at full cap. I think Terry was using his dewalt with the 8"". Not sure what he thought of it. I know the 6"" was a piece of cake when I started with the dewalt 18. With the xrp battery packs though."

Better try it again. When my lithium ion batteries are left in the cold they won't charge either until they warm up. Same happens if they are too warm after use."

I was thinking maybe using one of those hot packs that you put in your mitts."

I always have the heater on, so ya, that works."

990612,misfish,2017-01-10 01:41:00,29133,You chucked Terry's seat out?   That will teach him for chucking his other one. I had to sit on a milk crate.

990622,farsider,2017-01-10 04:02:00,456,"I use my 18V Makita with my 8"" Fin-Bor.  I baby it to extend the batteries life.  I bring a hot water bottle in a cooler bag just for my batteries.  I take the battery off and put it back in the cooler bag after the holes are drilled.  When drilling, I clear the shavings from the hole frequently as I drill.  I had the drill and batteries already but, it will definitely be a consideration when I upgrade.  Milwaukee has a 9.0Ah battery out now.  Mine are still the 3.0 Ah ones.  I bring my 3 batteries with me and I always bring the handle just-in-case.  Cheers, Mark"
990653,RandyLinden,2017-01-10 16:55:00,40,"Hi I just got a K-Drill not the least expensive option but is very light weight and is specifically designed to be used with a cordless 1/2"" drill. Been using it with an 18v Ryobi and 4amp lithium battery pack. So far not even thinking about ever using a gas powered auger again... Highly Recommended Bought mine at Radioworld Cheers"
990658,misfish,2017-01-10 17:38:00,29133,Was looking at the K. How much $$$ if you don't mind me asking?
990672,Jds63,2017-01-10 19:16:00,1365,"That K Drill looks pretty cool , but they don't mention the price on the website ."

990401,Jds63,2017-01-08 00:35:00,1365,Is that drill adaptor from Sail ? I saw one similar to that today .
990402,misfish,2017-01-08 00:39:00,29133,"Yes. It,s the clam adaptor."
990403,mike rousseau,2017-01-08 00:42:00,4661,Nice  That works really well
990407,Jds63,2017-01-08 00:52:00,1365,Nice !! I was looking at it ...  where did you get the adaptor for the auger to the drill ? 1/2 inch ?
990408,misfish,2017-01-08 01:00:00,29133,"It,s all included.  Just put the auger on"
990409,Jds63,2017-01-08 01:03:00,1365,"Thanks Brian ... That's sweet !!! I bought a gas auger about 6 yrs ago , tired of slugging it around , will try the adaptor out with my 20 volt drill ."
990410,misfish,2017-01-08 01:07:00,29133,Your welcome and welcome to the dark side.  
990411,misfish,2017-01-08 01:11:00,29133,"Nice  That works really well  Thanks Mike.  That drill sat outside 6 hours in -16 to -14 by the time we left. Got home, put the battery on the charger and it was still green. Meaning it was still full. I really like this set up. I also like all the nay sayers."
990415,GBW,2017-01-08 02:48:00,8460,"But B, you didn't tell them about your drill upgrade vs a standard unit.  Trust me if I had that drill I'd be using one and selling my gas unit!"
990423,Tjames09,2017-01-08 06:16:00,664,how much to buy the adapter plus the auger?
990435,Moosebunk,2017-01-08 14:14:00,3970,Good hand auger is faster. lol  Not...
990440,manitoubass2,2017-01-08 16:12:00,11391,"Lol, I dont miss hand auging one bit.  I like gas augers if its easy access, but this drill idea is pretty wicked if your walking out."
990444,misfish,2017-01-08 17:29:00,29133,"how much to buy the adapter plus the auger?  You can get the adaptor for about $60-$75 now.  The auger is a finbor3. I got a good deal on a new one. They go anywhere from $100 to $160. Depends where you buy. I think Terry got his off amazon for cheap.  As for the drill, you dont want to know."
990446,shanty gord,2017-01-08 17:45:00,16,"I just converted my 8"" gas augar over to the drill set up I removed the motor and the gears and made a straight shaft to attach the augar and drill too I don't know how to post a picture but it turned out pretty good I did use the Milwaukee drill Brian"

990450,crappieperchhunter,2017-01-08 18:50:00,2582,Looks sweet Brian.  If I chased bigger fish that's the route I would go. For perch my 4 inch FB3 or my 5 inch Lazer do the job with minimal effort as long as you have sharp blades.

Battery gauge didn't even register any drain.  I used the Canadian tire adapter for what limited fishing there was last winter and part of the winter before that, but the clam plate is the cats pajamas!"
990459,misfish,2017-01-08 20:34:00,29133,Well done Gord. Bit of a angle on the drill. Maybe mill some slots for the drill holder to straighten up..

990462,shanty gord,2017-01-08 20:59:00,16,Thank you Brian I thought it was a good project. I will have a look at it but I think it just appears to be on a angle in the picture. Because when I drive the augar it doesn't wobble even with the clamp removed
990468,DRIFTER_016,2017-01-08 21:53:00,10439,How many holes can you get through 5' of ice per battery?
