Fished for about 5 hours, found fish in 27 feet of water and had them under us all day.  Landed about 60 fish between us.  Caught on a mix of baits but the most productive were live minnows, a small PK spoon and a 2.5 inch Fin-S Fish."

990436,fundseeker,2017-01-08 14:33:00,27,"Hi Steve, Great Video, I'm hoping to find some crappie lakes here in the Parry Sound area . I've seen em on the finder in summer on a lake 5 min from town. This deep snow will likley cause a lot of slush . hopefully the last few days deep cold will help  but that snow sure insulates and pushes the ice down. You should really consider creating a smittly sled for under your plastic sled. We made some up out of aircraft aluminum and downhill skis and the difference in friction reduction in deep snow is amazing. ( I' m lucky my fishing buddy works on aircraft)  Granted your sled is heavier and wider so the smitty sled would need to be strong and larger but if you can get most of that plastic tub sled up out of the snow the effort to pull it is far less. The difference is night and day."
