990692,DanD,2017-01-10 21:33:00,2223,"I called Tim's today and asked (for a fee) if I could park my truck on his property and use his trails to haul my hut out. Don't trust blazing my own trail, this soon after ice up. The lady on the phone wants me to call back after 7 tonight and talk to Tim. She did say that the weekends would be no go for sure; because they're short on parking as it is. She doesn't see a problem weekdays; but I need to confirm this with Tim.  If it works out Cliff; there's a ride and a spot in my hut; that you'd be more then welcome to join us? It won't be this week, need to squirt some paint on the drop down frame; but possibly next, if the ice holds over the weekend? It'll likely just be my brother in-law and myself going; so there's lots of room. I'd like to meet and wet a line with one of the most respected guys on the board.  Dan."
990699,Big Cliff,2017-01-10 21:56:00,6899,Wow Dan I would like nothing better! And I would love to see your new toy first hand. I am  booked for Tuesday out of  Tim's with a friend I haven't seen in way too long but apart from that just let me know!
990703,DanD,2017-01-10 22:06:00,2223,If I get permission; it'll be a done deal!  Dan.
990738,Old Ironmaker,2017-01-11 03:17:00,8243,^ what I love best about OFC.
990751,DanD,2017-01-11 12:35:00,2223,Got home last night and the wife tells me that she found a last minute deal on a holiday trip to the Dominican Rep. So don't think I have forgotten Cliff; but it'll be Feb. by the time I get back and I'll get something arranged then. Now I need to find my telescopic pole and my travel gear; man I wish I put stuff away when I'm done with them. LOL  Dan.
990766,Sinker,2017-01-11 15:04:00,8692,"There is tons of free parking in Beaverton. I would think tim is probably running guys out from there still, as he usually runs down the river from his house, and I wouldn't think its frozen enough for him yet. There is always a good, well marked trail out from town as well. I'm not sure if people are parking on the ice yet or not, but I wouldn't be surprised.  IF you need some info on parking etc in beaverton, pm me. I am heading out there on tues or wed next week too.....maybe both days.  Cliff, I will text you on tuesday when I'm out there to see how your making out.  S."
990310,Big Cliff,2017-01-06 21:53:00,6899,"Well this winter is getting old already, I think we've had more ""snow days"" so far than in all of last winter. The one thing I have been really looking forward to though is getting out and doing some ice fishing with my son!  While I really don't like cold weather, it's a necessity naturally so these last few days have been sort of welcomed. I keep hoping to hear ""ice reports"" especially from reliable hut operators but so far these seem to be lacking.   Tonight I heard on the radio that after this brief cold spell temperatures are going to return to normal or slightly above for the rest of Jan. and probably hold there through Feb..  for the heating bills  for getting time ice fishing!  "
990313,DRIFTER_016,2017-01-06 22:21:00,10439,I know a place with good ice fishing.
990315,Jds63,2017-01-06 22:34:00,1365,I had plans to go ice fishing all this week but got sick on New Years Day ... the strain of these colds is nasty almost like the flu ... I gotta shake it soon and so I can get out there ...
990316,misfish,2017-01-06 22:45:00,29133,"Finally going to hit a small lake in the morning Cliff. I cant wait for this bay to freeze no more.  You are right,  it's a necessity naturally so these last few days have been sort of welcomed. Except for all the snow."
990318,John Bacon,2017-01-06 23:06:00,3277,I know a place with good ice fishing.  If you get the above normal temperatures as well then your ice may be gone by May two four too.
990321,manitoubass2,2017-01-06 23:20:00,11391, Says the guy that needs an 62ft extenstion  Hows fishing been up at the topo the earth?

Trying to figure out how I'm going to get my materials up to the cabin this year. Got all of 4"" of snow in the bush. My sled doesn't like riding on rocks!!! we probably have close to 2 feet of ice by now though, Been pretty warm so far this year. Looking like I'm going to have to move snow off the lake onto my trail to get a good base. You know where I can get one of those snow making machines they use @ the ski resorts cheap?"

990324,manitoubass2,2017-01-06 23:41:00,11391," Wow thats a bummer! Nature I spose eh? We have had about 3ft of white stuff in NW ontario so far, and shes been purdy cold lately.  Hopefully ya get some snow so ya can haul up materials and build.  In the meantime go for a fish! Or a rum, or both!"
990350,Beans,2017-01-07 14:46:00,3339,Cliff:...I read on the Lake Simcoe forum that Tim Hales was hoping to have some huts out by the 14th Jan...

990356,Old Ironmaker,2017-01-07 17:12:00,8243,"Can't wait to getto Nip for our 35 year reunion. I don't know if everyone is going on the ice though. I'm sitting here watching Erie freeze. So far the Farmers Almanac is wrong. We have had a total of 2"" of snow here, maybe. Cold a few days, mostly freezing rain up till this week. New Years Eve in Hamilton you didn't need a coat."
990363,SirCranksalot,2017-01-07 18:32:00,3291,"I know a place with good ice fishing. Yeah, right!! Shoulda hitched a ride back with Santa!  That's right in your neighborhood!"
990371,ecmilley,2017-01-07 20:00:00,2163,well cliffy you want to get out for some whitefish/lakers know a few lakes with safe ice if your game
990425,Big Cliff,2017-01-08 10:22:00,6899,Will pm you this Week!
990441,Sinker,2017-01-08 16:31:00,8692,Hales is going out tomorrow to check ice and maybe start putting huts out. Hoping to be in full swing for next weekend.  S.

990538,Acountdeleted,2017-01-09 13:24:00,2562,"Sadly the weather had been horrendous for ice fishing this year.  Went to Haliburton to fish a back lake. Walked about a kilometre in 2-2.5 feet of snow. Took almost 2 hours, almost killed me and I said forget it.  Met a trapper who owns the line in that area and he mentioned ice is slushy, not very safe. All the snow is insulating it.  Oh well. Maybe simcoe will freeze over soon. Fingers crossed."
990546,Sinker,2017-01-09 14:16:00,8692,"Floyd Hales is putting huts out today, so I would think its safe to assume Tim Hales is as well. Port bolster isn't as lucky, the ice is still a bit sketchy there.  S."
