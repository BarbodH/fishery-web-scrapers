989808,John Bacon,2017-01-02 01:19:00,3277,"Thanks for all of the feed back.  My wife passed away before Christmas.  The Jimmy was mine and Rav4 was hers.  I have a 17 year old son who currently has is G1.  When he gets is his G2, he will have to be added to my insurance.  If I have two vehicles, then he will need to be added as a principle drivers of one.  I am not sure what it would cost to have a 17 year old boy with a G2 insured as a principle driver; but I know it will be a lot.I am hoping to get rid of one vehicle so that I can insure him as an occasional driver.  I would prefer to keep the Jimmy, but the Rav4 comes with an outstanding loan for considerably more than what Toyota mentioned as a trade in value.  So it will take a lot of cash up front for me to walk away from the Rav4.  Plus the Jimmy is eleven and a half years old and may need to be replaced in a few years.  The thought of having to buy another vehicle a few years after paying to walk a way from 13 month old one is not a pleasant one.That is why I am considering keeping the Rav4.  Of course, that means it have to serve as a two vehicle.There has been a lot of input from a lot of people: Thanks for all of the input so far.  I would still be interested in hearing more from people who have towed a similar sized boat with the same or similar vehicle.I am also considering other options, such having someone take over the vehicle and the loan, which would probably cost me, but may cost less than returning to the dealer.  But I am still contemplating towing with the Rav4.  "

Front brakes provide most of your stopping power, putting more than the recommended weight on the rear by towing could detract from that.  http://knowhow.napaonline.com/front-brakes-vs-rear-brakes-whats-the-difference/"

989850,Old Ironmaker,2017-01-02 17:55:00,8243,"Oh John, I m so sorry to hear of your loss. Maybe this isn't the time to make a big decision. You probably won't be towing it until spring anyway. Take a time out. Check with your loan provider, you may have life insurance on that loan, check.  A pals son saved his entire life to buy a new CJ Jeep when he turned 16, every penny ever given to him as gifts for 16 years. The Jeep was going for 24K and the annual insurance for him as principle driver was over $10,000.00 a year, that was years ago insurance rates hasn't gone down. Call your broker for a quote for your 17 year old.  Get the right tow vehicle for the boat. This isn't Australia.  edit: I just had a thought, scary. What if you only insure the Rav during the winter months and the Jimmy during those months when you will need it to tow. Then you only have 1 available vehicle for 2 drivers. You won't get hammered on the loan for the Rav, the Lads insurance rates are extremely less and the wear on the older Jimmy is far less too."

I currently have a 2015 Rav4 and 2005 GMC Jimmy; but I need to reduce that to just one vehicle in the near future.  I would rather keep the Jimmy; but, it may not make financial sense.I have a 16' Princecraft with a 50hp Merc 2 stroke on it.  It's not too heavy but it will exceed the 1,500 pound towing capacity what all of the gear is included.I would appreciate hearing from anyone who has had experience towing with this vehicle."

My concern would be stopping. that's where I suggest that you have brakes installed on the trailer. I would also suggest surge brakes over electric; due to the design of the electric needing clean, smooth drum surface for the electro magnet to adhere too during braking. Electricity, magnets, bare steel and water adds up to corrosion. Surge brake is a bit more costly on installation; but less maintenance and servicing required.

It was a turbo so i had plenty of power, but it was really hard on the car. Brakes took a major beating. The rav will do it but it going to wear it out quick and stopping isnt going to be great. Even on windy days you will get blown all over the road. Its not an ideal set up but it will do it, barely."

However, don't expect to go screaming past others while passing them and it'll never be as stable as towing with a truck. You'll definitely want trailer brakes.  As for brakes, 25 years ago you'd want to shy away from electric brakes, but these days there are multiple options specifically designed for boat trailers. No matter how you slice it, surge brakes suck in comparison.  -no vehicle traction means no trailer brakes either (snow, ice, mud, up or down hill) with surge while electric can be controlled 100% independently from the vehicle brakes  -electric brakes are activated quicker which results in shorter stopping distances  -surge can activate when unwanted on steep grades  -much easier to repair the electric system  -a few taps on the electric controller can stop an improperly loaded trailer from swaying  "

I depends on whether the axle on your trail can accommodate the brake backing plates, whether you go surge or electric and disc or drum set up? If you go electric, which is going to be drum brake; even if you have to change the axle (Likely will) the cost would likely be under a grand or close too; if you have someone do it for you. If you can do the install; Princess Auto has a 3500lb axle (72"") complete with a drum brake set up, on sale for $330.00. A controller for around a $100.00, a bit of wiring and you're set.  Dan."
989634,mikeh,2016-12-29 16:52:00,824,"as soon as you say you are over your towing capacity, I'd say get a bigger vehicle(or one that has a higher rating) ,"
989643,spincast,2016-12-29 19:11:00,3279,"I would likely want to know the implications for insurance and  highway traffic act violations of towing in excess of the vehicle capacity.  As a commercial operator, I know it has some pretty significant fines and points associated with it. With or without brakes, I suspect there might be some issues here if you were ever involved in an accident, regardless of fault, (ones a lawyer would find very attractive for the other-side, and one your insurance company likely would not respond to). Wouldn't be a good outcome in a  long weekend blitz such as the OPP run either."
989644,hutch4113,2016-12-29 21:03:00,374,"I have not towed with a RAV4, but did tow for a while with a CUV (Hyundai Veracruz).  While I had thought I calculated the weight of my boat correctly, and was under the 3500 pound towing limit on the vehicle, I did not take into account things likes supplies and/or people in the Car.  Also did not take into account tongue weight.  I now tow with a Truck, and the difference is night and day - and I would not want to go back.  As mentioned, one key area is braking, and as DanD mentioned, there are things you can do to provide that.  But another key factor is stability, and the Vehicles ability to handle the weight behind it.  I often felt like the Boat was pushing my tow vehicle around - and I did not realize how true that was, until I got a properly sized tow vehicle.  Now it feels like the Truck is in control - and if I had to do something evasive, I would be more comfortable about maintaining control.  Something to think about anyway."

No idea how much it weighs but I've never had an issue on the road or highway. Launching sometimes  I get wet if the ramp is very shallow. It's a 5 speed standard and i'm still passing everyone in sight! Just make sure your tongue weight is below what that car calls for.

989649,aplumma,2016-12-29 23:33:00,6896,It is not the times that things are going right you need to worry about it is if you can keep yourself from wrecking when someone else messes you up. Exceeding your abilities of your tow vehicle is a legal nightmare not to mention the fact that you might injure someone and have to live with the fact it could possibly have been avoided. I say don't do it if you can afford the luxury of a boat you need to be responsible and tow with the correct vehicle.  Sorry this is a pet peeve of mine I saw someone get killed when an overloaded RV was being towed with a compact pick up.  Art

My boat went across the scales fully loaded with gear, 16 foot with a 50hp and it weighed right on 1480LBS.  My towing capacity is 1500.  My exact vehicle they use in Australia to tow 3500LB glass boats regularily. The only difference being trailer brakes.  I believe a lot of North American vehicles get under rated.  It depends how much heavier your boat is!  If it where my vehicle, and it was within a couple hundred pounds, I'd probably do it."

Example; you're foot is into the brake peddle hard enough to cause wheel lock up and you're sliding; the brake system has done its job; but there not enough vehicle to overcome the push of the trailer. Plus this Rav likely has ABS, which will not allow locking of the wheels; so you're going through that intersection whether you like to or not. Trailer brakes will handle the trailer and allow the tow vehicle's brake to do their own job.  Believe me I know this from experience. 1/2 ton pick up truck on the trailer; my 1500 Avalanche towing the trailer, no trailer brake controller on the Avalanche. A traffic light turned unexpectedly on me and all I could hear was the ABS going nuts trying to stop the wheels from locking. I gave up trying to stop halfway through the intersection and got back on the throttle. I pulled over and had to clean out my shorts; no idea how I made it through without hitting anyone.  Dan."
