989848,Sterling,2017-01-02 17:20:00,477,Anyone been out?  I'll be out there tonight for a couple hours. Supposedly it was PACKED yesterday.
989883,Sterling,2017-01-03 00:15:00,477,"Managed to get out and drop lines for about 45 minutes, the fish were on fire! Pulled in 5 fish, lost 4, including a dandy that was peeling line (probably a pike).  Going back out tomorrow for sure."
989884,GBW,2017-01-03 00:29:00,8460,"Nice, at least you got to get out!  Me, not sure when I'll even have a chance to hit the ice anytime soon around here...  *sigh*"
989890,Joeytier,2017-01-03 02:25:00,3990,I'll be out on 'flats' chasing jumbos tomorrow.  Heard nothing but good things from opening day.

989901,Cosmos,2017-01-03 12:46:00,588,"Went yesterday. We  did well catching pretty much everything. Small spoons, jigs with shiners did a trick."
989927,Sterling,2017-01-03 16:49:00,477,"What we're you using? Minnows? I am heading there this Saturday. Hope to have a fun outing!  Yes we were using a mix of chubs and shiners. Still torn as to which is best. A healthy shiner will always outfish a chub, but chubs refuse to die so you're more guaranteed to have a live bait swimming around..."
989969,Sterling,2017-01-03 23:56:00,477,"Tonight wasn't so good. Pulled up 4 fish within the first 30 minutes, then nothing at all until sundown. Had 4 extra lines this time too.  Once again the average size seemed better than last year. The population is growing up!  Joey how did you do with perch???"
