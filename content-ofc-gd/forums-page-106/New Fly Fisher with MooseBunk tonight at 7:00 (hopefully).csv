There is another run of it at 7:00 tonight so, hopefully it will be the same episode and will be able to record it and watch the whole thing.  Cheers, Mark "

990433,Moosebunk,2017-01-08 14:04:00,3970,"  No WFN here... gonna miss the T.V. show.  But it'll likely be on YouTube later... Great piking and like the drone work.  Busy working, site seeing and doing some on the ground arctic char research for maybe some future date.  "
990477,Steelheadphycho,2017-01-08 23:00:00,470," Same here. I did some snooping and PBS also caries the show here in the US.  But not here I NE Ohio......  fudge  So I'll await the YouTube posting as well. When anyone sees it, could they let us know?  Great pics as always Bunk! Bet it's colder than a well diggers posterior up there!"
