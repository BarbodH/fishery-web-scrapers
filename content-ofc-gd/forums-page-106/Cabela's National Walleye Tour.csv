990014,Yellow Fever,2017-01-04 12:05:00,139,I have fished it as a co out of Port Clinton. As long as you get a decent pro you should be ok. Last year the 1st pro i had clearly wasn't up to snuff but the second pro was top notch. I fish there quite often and have a Ranger 620 so know the area pretty well. I advised them both that i was a fisherman and had been there pre-fishing all week but that they were the captain and i was there to fish with them and fish their program unless they asked me. Had no issues with either. Remember there are a ton of good anglers that don't want to pay the pro entry for whatever reason and fish as a co and there are guys that can pay the pro entry but shouldn't. Also dont be shy on the gas money....i gave them both $100.
990124,67ZL1,2017-01-05 01:05:00,51,Hey Yellow Fever thx for the reply. What were you expected to bring for the day? My buddy said that the Pro's supply everything?
990149,Yellow Fever,2017-01-05 12:03:00,139,Pros supply everything...i bring a small lunch with something to drink and gas money. In most cases $50 is enough. I plan on being there

990230,Yellow Fever,2017-01-05 22:46:00,139,"Yes   you could bring a rainsuit....I have extras on my boat and wore mine anyway, Never thought to ask if they had them. Bring all your outdoor gear and you can ask the pros what they want you to bring during the meet and greet"
