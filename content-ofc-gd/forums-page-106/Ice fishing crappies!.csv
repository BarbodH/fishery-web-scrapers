I recently started doing some video blogs that I'm going to try and keep up with, I hope people enjoy them.  I've been trying to pump them out every couple days, but anyways here's one from a week ago on a little back lake for some crappies.  A couple NSFW words here and there, I apologize, but the point of the blogs are to be candid and open to sharing the experiences and tips.  This one is VLOG #2 of 6 that I've done so far. Enjoy, check them out and let me know what you think or what you want to see coming up.  I'm open to sharing tips and tricks."
