990478,Acountdeleted,2017-01-08 23:14:00,2562,Great vid B. Glad to see you got out.  The snow stopped me right in my tracks. 24 inches plus in Haliburton made it almost impossible to get to my back lakes.

990503,Rizzo,2017-01-09 02:17:00,4754,aaaah herring. Is there an easier fish on earth to catch? I guess that's why they had to be protected. Aggressive little buggers.Nice video Brian

I found one but man what a shister site. making money off a free upload. So go searching some more and found my up grade.   This is the live reel of the morning.     Im looking forward to more now.  This high teq stuff hurts me brain."
