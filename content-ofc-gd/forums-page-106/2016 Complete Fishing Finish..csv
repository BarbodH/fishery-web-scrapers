989805,Moosebunk,2017-01-02 01:12:00,3970,"       2016 was a bit of a strange year for time management.  Normally most plans with work and play are sorted out long before any days arrive. Last winter was in a funk though, wondering what was to come and by spring, nothing much had really changed. The seasons were passing by and I had to roll with it.  In the end the year all came together better than I ever did expect. Seemingly found a work and play balance with the scales leaning heavily to the fun side.  Along the way, caught a tonne of new species, personal bests and had some amazing fishing experiences from north to south. Sturgeon, arctic char, gar, pike, sharks and some other usual fish make up the bulk of the fish porn in this one.

And there is almost a solid quarter inch of ice now on the shore of Loughborough!!!  Felt haphazard yes... but maybe some method to the madness.  Will likely be walking on 5+ feet of ice by this weekend and only wondering what swims beneath.  A great read with some beauty pics. Thanks Bunk for making the time to put this report together. You're living the life man and I'm envious.  Thanks again Jay. Let's try and meet up around Ottawa for a day out this year.  Thanx Bunk that was an awesome report!  Those char have to be the prettiest fish I've ever seen.  That walleye on your website is huge!  Think that eye was near 14lbs... I think. 13lb, 14oz.  A good one anyways but yeah, still not quite as sexy as the glowing orange char.   Thanks for flipping over a page to take a look.  Best fishes for the New Year!"
