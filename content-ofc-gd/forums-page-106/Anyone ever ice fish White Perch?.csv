Lots of carp and bullheads, pike, white perch and black crappies are the main fish species in there. I don't think it gets very deep, probably 5 or 6 ft max. Anyone ever ice fish for White Perch? Is there any techniques to it? Once I know the ice is solid, I'll probably try for pike and white perch. Or crappie if I can find em."
989888,bigugli,2017-01-03 01:40:00,6138,We get them down our way on occasion. Usually in the later part of the ice season on flats just off a point.
989992,Locnar,2017-01-04 02:14:00,645,"Right on, I think the entire ""bay""... which used to be connected to Lake O... is entirely made up of flats, some areas shallower than others... and no real points. I have caught a few of them in the spring, one about 2lbs on a pike minnow. But I don't know much about them at all. Just that I was not expecting to see a flash of silver when I was bringing it in."
