990160,Tom S,2017-01-05 15:17:00,362,"I love how whoever put together the promotional pictures couldn't even bother to research basic fishing facts. Last time I checked we don't ice fish for saltwater tropical species. Makes me think that someone created a nice underwater drone and is now trying to create a market for it.  A neat toy for scouting out structure and spooking fish, but I don't think that you'll see many fish being caught with it. Here, eat this chunk of bait dangling 6"" from the strange sounding large moving object. Wait, now it has a light on it! Done deal. Besides, the line is slack when that fish strikes, good look getting the hook set in time. Maybe it can be used as shark bait? Put some flippers on it so it looks like a seal... topwater Great Whites?  I'd be more worried about drones being used for hunting than for fishing. Unethical hunters could use drones to push target animals towards a stand. I wouldn't be surprised if we see that showing up in the regulations in the near future."

990169,Acountdeleted,2017-01-05 16:27:00,2562,"VR Goggles! Because why go for a swim when you can go for a virtual reality swim?  Its probably too expensive, but it'd be pretty cool when scouting new lakes to find underwater reefs and shoals before drilling a bunch of holes."
990170,steverowbotham,2017-01-05 16:40:00,1800,could get some great footage. Not much of a practical fishing purpose IMO
990183,grimsbylander,2017-01-05 18:16:00,3016,I just ordered one...now in a tournament I can see what baits my competitors are using! LOL
990185,EC1,2017-01-05 18:21:00,930,"Another piece of equipment to cut out the learning curve in fishing. There's a lot of things I'd love to do with it, but the price tag probably isn't going to be pretty. The next thing to worry about would be battery life in our climate especially during the ice season."
990187,RangerGuy,2017-01-05 19:15:00,564,"Fish may get spooked by it, but that's not to say you can't pilot it up shallow way past some structure, release your bait and work it back. Won't even have to learn to cast eventually .."
990190,manitoubass2,2017-01-05 19:25:00,11391,"This would be a great idea for law enforcement/rescue teams etc.  Looks pretty silly for fishing.  Not gonna lie though, id enjoy playing around with it just exploring things"

990217,tb4me,2017-01-05 22:13:00,3295,Very cool toy..Should be against the law to use for any sort of hunting or fishing advantage..
990218,misfish,2017-01-05 22:15:00,29133,"Very cool toy..Should be against the law to use for any sort of hunting or fishing advantage..   Ya, but I can see a pro angler using it for prefishing."
990223,Acountdeleted,2017-01-05 22:24:00,2562,Or scaring the fish away from the competition.
990225,misfish,2017-01-05 22:28:00,29133,"Or scaring the fish away from the competition.   they are already using under water cameras, so this one is an upgrade."
