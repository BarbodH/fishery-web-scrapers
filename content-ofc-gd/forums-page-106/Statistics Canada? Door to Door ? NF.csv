990076,misfish,2017-01-04 21:22:00,29133,"census program?  yes, i've had them come by  Yes Raf. Seems to be about health care and such. They want me to call to set up an appointment.  To busy ferdat."
990077,GBW,2017-01-04 21:30:00,8460,In the past I had them stop in too
990084,manitoubass2,2017-01-04 21:52:00,11391,"They came here 3 seperate times about 3 months ago lol.  Our family was too large and they needed a different or additional document, cant remember?  It was funny he gave me a deadline though. Sure buddy"
990085,davey buoy,2017-01-04 21:56:00,5505,"Here quite often Brian,well it seems that way,lol."
990106,dave524,2017-01-04 23:06:00,4508,"I had something come in the mail about health care, seemed to be a third party research thing saying they were Goverment affiliated , I shredded it and haven't heard any more unless it was one of those survey phone calls I hang up on. Wife got one too, she's a US Citizen but they put her on the voting list every election, mess is modus operandi for the government."

990128,Sterling,2017-01-05 01:43:00,477,Since when does the goverment send people to YOUR door to interview for stats canada?  Anyone else have them come to your door?  They've been doing that for at least a decade.
990129,Raf,2017-01-05 02:13:00,3495,"I told them my hourly rate when I opened the door and they left.  Appraently, they came back later and my nicer half opened the door.  I need to explain that her time is money too."
990150,Sterling,2017-01-05 12:53:00,477,"Guys keep in mind the people going door to door are just ordinary people like you and I. Doing their job & putting bread on the table.  My sweet mother was a census worker for a couple years and did some door to door. I don't see the need to give them trouble/attitude. It's not like these people are trying to sell you something. The information gathered is purposeful, or at least that's the intent.  Also keep in mind that it's our legal duty to fill out any census requirements. Just like some speed limits, I may not be in agreement, but it's the law anyway."
990300,Dara,2017-01-06 20:56:00,3052,Can't do it here...we made a bylaw against door to door soliciting. Why on earth would the govt waste money sending people door to door when they have a law that forces you to fill out a census
990303,manitoubass2,2017-01-06 21:12:00,11391,"Yeah.  Its the census thats a pain, not those delivering it.  The two guys that delivered our were super nice, but scared of our dog lol.  They advertised census deliverers for hire at the post office. Seems like a decent gig for those that need work, extra work etc."
990304,AKRISONER,2017-01-06 21:19:00,5558,"They came here 3 seperate times about 3 months ago lol.  Our family was too large and they needed a different or additional document, cant remember?  It was funny he gave me a deadline though. Sure buddy  pretty sure i cant count high enough to count all your kids. Id definitely be estimating   they came by for the cencus multiple times and it was all screwed up because i was in the process of moving so my gf at the time had moved the day before and was technically not in canada during the day I as well as her destination completed the census."
990306,manitoubass2,2017-01-06 21:23:00,11391,"Lol. Yeah, 7 kids. My mom and brother in law also live with us.  Funny, the guy that gave me a deadline never came back???  The paperwork took almost a full day. Ill admit it was annoying."
990314,DRIFTER_016,2017-01-06 22:29:00,10439,"census program?  yes, i've had them come by  Yup, me too."
990317,DaveRoach,2017-01-06 22:59:00,202,"Came to my door three times claiming I didn't fill out census, threatened me as I laughed finally showing my copy. Asked me to resend in which I replied cant trust the mail system any more then door to door man.  No more visits, imagine that"
