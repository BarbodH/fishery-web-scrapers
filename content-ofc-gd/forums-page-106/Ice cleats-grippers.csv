989897,turtle,2017-01-03 11:46:00,274,"I'm looking for half (or more) decent ice cleats that strap over full sized winter boots. I sometimes walk several km in a day on the ice.  What do you recommend and where did you get them?  Thanks.  Also drove from north Haliburton down on hwy 35 yesterday,  main part of Kennisis still open, Grass/Green iced over with some open water & one hut out, 12 Mile & Mountain ice over but saw no one out, Gull Lake at Miners Bay est. 10 huts out."
989898,Garnet,2017-01-03 11:55:00,2056,By far the best I've seen are Neos Voyager Stabilizers VNS1.  Go to Mister Safety Shoe and look under Accessories.
989902,Ralph Field,2017-01-03 14:06:00,1018,I use ones from Lee Valley ! Forget their cost and what they are called.
989903,mike rousseau,2017-01-03 14:27:00,4661,"I use these https://www.marks.com/en/categories/workwear/mens-workwear/dakota/product/grip-on-20176.html#20176%5Bcolor%5D=ASSORT  They are a good ""lightweight"" option and do ok on the ice  I get them onto my size 13 boots  They are definitely not the best on the market but if you want a lightweight compact set of cleats these are great  If you want the best grip and don't care about weight I'd get something else"
989908,Sinker,2017-01-03 15:08:00,8692,"I use these and they happen to be on sale. They are a bit heavy, but they work awesome.   http://www.canadiantire.ca/en/pdp/ht-enterprises-super-stud-sandal-cleats-black-0780863p.html  You can also just screw some hex screws into the lugs of your boots. It makes a huge difference as well.  S."

989916,DRIFTER_016,2017-01-03 15:27:00,10439,I have these ones: https://www.amazon.ca/IMPACTO-MAXX-100-02-Stabilicers-Traction-8-5-10-5/dp/B0002M9DO0/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1483457201&sr=8-3&keywords=stabilicer
989929,farsider,2017-01-03 17:11:00,456,"I use the ones from Lee Valley as well.  No problems after several seasons of use.  I have seen them available elsewhere too.  http://www.leevalley.com/en/garden/page.aspx?p=40911&cat=2,51676,40911  Cheers, Mark"
989945,Sinker,2017-01-03 19:04:00,8692,Almost identical to the HT cleats I posted. They work good.
989965,misfish,2017-01-03 23:34:00,29133,"I dont like the velcro on these. I find once the snow get into them, they are terrible. Going to screw into my boot soles this year."
989975,GBW,2017-01-04 00:46:00,8460,My ex got me these years ago and I have never had an issue with these. She got them at a walmart I'm sure... https://www.amazon.com/Celsius-Sure-Grip-Cleats-Easy-Spikes/dp/B000ZKSW78

990005,Sinker,2017-01-04 05:35:00,8692,Mine have been great. I dont wear them if there is much snow though. Only glare ice or slippery ice with a bit 9f snow.  S.
