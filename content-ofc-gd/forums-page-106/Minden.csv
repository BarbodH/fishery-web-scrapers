989551,GBW,2016-12-27 04:38:00,8460,"Hi GBW, We spent Christmas  and today in Burnt River and at the cottage on 4 Mile Lk.. I didn't even get a chance to go down to the lake. Would have been disappointing.I'm thinking of coming back over from Parry Sound to try the walleye fshing through the ice.Have you had any luck other winters?  I did OK  last summer. My folks place is close to the boat ramp for the lake and it was GARBAGE ICE since it froze up.  Now going to be worse.  I hope this rain melts all the surface crap and then get's a deep freeze.  I know I'm staying away from it for another month with plans and current conditions.  However, walleye is CLOSED there in the winter so we just hit the perch and gills on the ice.  There are a few spots for those fish through the ice but if you don't find them in the softwater times it's even harder to find them in the ice season.  That lake is a rather steady depth mid lake and to the North so for the pan-fish you can find them one day in 12' by a weed edge and then in 20' the same time the next day.  Please remember walleye is closed in the winter and it's just perch (jumbo's are rare!) and blue gills.  Fun for the kids when safe... *edit to add the bold*"
989677,slightlyhuman,2016-12-30 17:24:00,29,Any updates on the area? planning to go up to koshlong lake on sunday-monday
989684,Big Cliff,2016-12-30 21:58:00,6899,"Just be really careful, spud step, spud step...... Temperatures have been all over the place and some areas where I would think are safe actually have open water. There is some good ice to be found (4-5"") on some of the smaller lakes but it's still hit and miss."
989758,brkygetr,2017-01-01 17:25:00,425,"Found a few earlier in the week. Ice was tempermental to say the least and wickedly variable. Smaller lakes. nothing more than 4-5"" and very layered. The snowfall they had on Thursday/Friday will  not help much.     "
989762,Jds63,2017-01-01 18:03:00,1365,Very nice ? !
989892,slightlyhuman,2017-01-03 03:52:00,29,"got out on a smaller bay of koshlong today, this was the crappiest ice ive ever been on for being 6-7"" thick... safe, but badly layered and soft. ended up only bringing in one. happy nonetheless   "
989893,GBW,2017-01-03 05:03:00,8460, That's a heck of a nice fish man!

Am I right in thinking the rain and the upcoming cold spell will help make the ice a lot nicer?"

990060,Joeytier,2017-01-04 20:20:00,3990,"Damn Chris, one trip and you're already into bigger specks than me"
990063,AKRISONER,2017-01-04 20:33:00,5558,"we got a reset up in PAB leading up to new years, our 5 inches of slush on top of 1 inch of black ice froze up solid...however a pile of snow and wind has made the whole lake a swamp again. Hopefully its gotten wet enough that this cold snap is gonna lock the slush up again. Typical on GB though for us to be variable as all hell with the ice, the majority of our ice is just frozen slush most years from the continuing daily rise and fall of water levels due to the wind.  Yes...this ice is as bad as it looks   "

988314,Jds63,2016-12-10 19:05:00,1365,"I'm up north of Minden this weekend. It's beautiful , lots of snow ... smaller  bays and lakes are skimmed over , bigger lakes nothing yet ."
988316,GBW,2016-12-10 20:12:00,8460,I'm visiting my parents on 4 mile lake (burnt river) and the only ice there was has been broken up from the wind and waves
988320,Locnar,2016-12-10 21:22:00,645,"Right on guys, thanks for the heads up! With the weather forecast, give it a couple weeks?"
988321,Joeytier,2016-12-10 22:44:00,3990,"Sounds like minden is gonna get peppered with snowfall, which will wreak havoc on that early ice."
988364,singingdog,2016-12-11 12:14:00,1047,"I think you are looking at a couple of weeks for decent ice. Most lakes, even smaller ones, were open 3 days ago. Now we are looking at 20-30 cms of snow over the next 7 days."
988386,Locnar,2016-12-11 17:27:00,645,"oh shizzah, a good foot o' snow comin' eh?"

988478,Sinker,2016-12-12 18:42:00,8692,Maybe we will get lucky and the snow will flood the ice and it will all freeze later this week?  S.

I'm not going back till Christmas but my father will keep me posted on the ice there. It's now frozen over and I will check the ice on boxing day. My buddy lives on Washburn Island on Scugog and he went out to test the area today and it was slush and MAX 2"" of ice where he tested at the tip of the island.  He didn't go far out..."
989143,Locnar,2016-12-20 05:15:00,645,"Right on man, thanks for the update. Do you think a small lake just north of Norland would be any better?"
989144,GBW,2016-12-20 06:16:00,8460,"Right on man, thanks for the update. Do you think a small lake just north of Norland would be any better? Well dude they all are different due to depth and the way the wind hit's the water (direction wise hence 4ML to freeze up when it did just the other day).  So I'd never tell anyone ""sure go out and check it, it should be safe"" cause my ""safe area"" on said lake could be 4x thicker then your actual spot.  Is it logical that the lake in Norland has more ice as its close to my folks place, sure.  BUT I'D NEVER TELL YOU AND OTHERS it's ""SAFE"".  Spud bar and safety gear and a buddy is all I can offer there on the 'legit' reply.  I honestly don't feel any lake in the area is even close to safe yet to just roam free in search of fish..."
989162,Locnar,2016-12-20 15:10:00,645,I respect that and appreciate your response. And I understand that it is still early... and I definitely wouldn't be going alone. My buddy and I were thinking of checking out the lake on New Years weekend.

My buddy and I were thinking of checking out the lake on New Years weekend. No worries. One would hope by then it should be better but it's only -2 right now in Lindsay as I post this.  Also It's hard to tell how snow covered things are and we all know snow doesn't help...
989205,Chuck Enwinde,2016-12-21 05:07:00,247,"Right on man, thanks for the update. Do you think a small lake just north of Norland would be any better? I was on a small lake North of Norland on Saturday and it had about 3 inches of refrozen slush with about a half inch of black ice.  Another small lake near Bancroft had even less.  The snow up there has really buggered up the ice making on the lakes that were already skimmed when they got dumped on."

Another small lake near Bancroft had even less.  The snow up there has really buggered up the ice making on the lakes that were already skimmed when they got dumped on.  Thanks for the update! How much snow was on top of the ice? Wondering about that rain on Boxing Day... how much damage it will do to the ice... or if it might help by melting to snow?
989263,GBW,2016-12-22 01:05:00,8460,well today was +1* for most of the day here in Lindsay.  I'm not expecting to find safe ice this weekend when I go visit my folks...
989310,Joeytier,2016-12-22 23:36:00,3990,"90% of the back lakes here have less than 5"" of ice so I wouldn't expect to see much fishable ice in Central Ontario this weekend"
989313,GBW,2016-12-23 00:03:00,8460,today was warm temps here (in the + range) so I'd expect that zero in my area is good to so be safe!
989321,J Roelofsen,2016-12-23 02:16:00,84,"Believe it or not there was people on both Wildwood and Pittock lakes in my area last Thurs/Fri. Lots of good ice on the usual areas of St Clair and a few guys fishing the Thames already. Most smaller, shallow water bodies are GTG for this weekend around here (London area).  I'll be on a favorite Crappie/Gill pond tomorrow night that should have around 6"". The coming thaw will put any hopes of ""safe"" ice to an end by Monday and hopefully flush some ice from the local creeks to allow for holiday steelheading:)  Josh"
989324,chris.brock,2016-12-23 02:39:00,4053,"I believe it.  It's the big dumps of snow that came after the lakes skimmed over that buggered up the Haliburton ice. I'll be up all week next week if you want to know how the ice is Locnar. No internet, it would have to be texting."
989541,GBW,2016-12-26 22:39:00,8460,"Well Loncar and others considering 4 mile lake, NOPE!  Yesterday it was a skim of snow in spots, 2"" of slush then a few (and I do mean just a few) hits with the spud bar and it was through.  The crazy amount of rain that fell there last night and all day just turned everything to slush.  Going to be a while there...  Oh and the road in to the lake most days takes 3 - 4 min.  Took 30 to get out!  Spun out right at the boat ramp going 5 KPH and almost ditched it two more times in 4x4LOW and 1st gear..."
