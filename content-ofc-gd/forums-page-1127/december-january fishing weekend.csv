120657,blizzcat,2007-10-04 17:17:00,92,"Hi everyone! I'm new to the forums, and I've really enjoyed my fishing experiences so far. I've been dating a guy who lives and breaths to fish! our 2 year aniversary is coming up early december and i'm looking to get him a fishing treat. I was thinking of finding a cottage for ice fishing or something to rent for a weekend. i am still a university student so i can't go over 300 (max.). as well, I'm worried that ice fishing won't be ready by mid-late december/early january. another catch in my plan is that he's in training for a work thing untill the end of novemeber so we wont know what shifts he's working until almost right before our anniversary.  I'm just looking for any advice on where to go, what to take him fishing for, and whats open/available at this time?  he favours fly fishing, but he loves going out on a boat and going for bass, walleye, or pike too. he knows everything about fishing a lot better then i do and i just want to find somewhere they he will really enjoy. we live in the GTA if that helps, but we can drive to a place no problem.  Thanks!"

Very nice romantic getaway plus gives the boyfriend time to fish. If its after Dec 15 same thing only lower Niagara for Steelhead and Lakers. Ice fishing if the weather is like last year will be a no go."
120661,dustink,2007-10-04 17:43:00,526,"No help on suggestions...but welcome!!  And after you do this for him, he better marry you!!  (if he's smart....)  well done! dk"
120662,Raf,2007-10-04 17:50:00,3495,it's doubtful you'll see any safe ice or ice at all at that time unless you travel north.  end of dec to beginning of jan is a bit of a black hole in the fishn season.
120666,tonyb,2007-10-04 18:06:00,1637,"I second hiring a guide for the Lower Niagara river for Trout (Rainbow, Brown, Lake)  The Musky thing is cool too, but you'll get WAY more numbers of fish if you are targeting trout (up to 30 in a day)  I highly recommend this guide as I know that Aaron Shirley had his choice of guides to refer clients to when he quit his guiding business, and Frank at Niagara Sportifishing got the nod.  If anyone knows about anglers on the Niagara you have likely heard of Frank or Aaron.  Niagara Sportfishing  Your guy is definately lucky to have someone so understanding about his addiction  Tony"
120672,Fishmaster,2007-10-04 18:58:00,920,Steealhead fishing is awesome in the Lower Niagara in the winter ...  PS: you have mail Lyra
120673,Toronto_Angler,2007-10-04 19:12:00,698,Good thread. My fiancee loves Niagara (something about a casino  )An early december trip for Casino and then some steelhead might be in order.
120674,Squid,2007-10-04 19:14:00,1656,Niagara river is a great choice.

120694,wallyboss,2007-10-04 20:35:00,1095,Plus isn't Niagara Falls the Honeymoon capital of the world.   REALLY SURPRISE HIM!!!!!!!  :clapping:
120745,Jen,2007-10-05 00:56:00,833,"Welcome to the Board Lyra!!  That would be an awesome gift, just the fact that you are here is impressive... sounds like you guys are going to have an awesome future together... I look forward to your fishing posts!  Cheers Jen"
120746,mcallister.grant,2007-10-05 01:02:00,327,Hope my wife see's this!!  That is a very nice gesture
120757,Muskieman,2007-10-05 01:35:00,2472,"I suggest Callander area,,   Fish in Callander Bay on Lake Nipissing ..If we have a normal winter you should be able to drive out onto the lake  opening day . January 1st or anytime there after. Many of the lodges offer an ICE BUNGALOW for a reasonable rate.. That's right you sleep   out on the ice in a little hut.   . actually very comphy....and pretty spacious.  I got this as a gift a few years ago ,,, I'm glad my wife loves me  ..she sent me to sleep out on a lake in a hut in the middle of winter with a case of beer and some minnows....."
120809,fishdawg,2007-10-05 10:50:00,912,"i'll also say Niagara trout  if Frank is booked up, look up Grant Koppers,   another solid guide down that way"
120956,blizzcat,2007-10-05 18:20:00,92,"wow! i did not expect all these responses. Thanks for all the advice so far everyone! the Niagara river sounds very interesting and i'll be sure to look up Lake Nipissing too! you guys have really jump started my plans  ! I'm gonna start researching perfect places and i just need to wait until i found out my boyfriends work schedule and then i'll book somewhere. the charters look cool, though most seem out of my price range. but i will keep browsing!  and thanks to those who PM'd me, I am taking your advice and when it gets closer to the time of booking maybe expect me to contact you."
128886,blizzcat,2007-11-01 17:23:00,92,"I don't know if anyone is checking this thread anymore. But if you are, I have booked a charter with Fishmaster for December on the Niagara river. Thank you all for your suggestions and help!! I'm really excited, and think this is going to be a great anniversary present!"
128887,ccmtcanada,2007-11-01 17:28:00,7971,You wont be disappointed with your decision!!!  Good luck and I look forward to your report....remember to take lots of pictures....oh...and video too!!!  It's a GREAT anniversary present!!  My wife booked us a heated ice hut on Scugog last winter for Valentines day....a great way to spend time with your significant other that's for sure!
128889,Seaweed,2007-11-01 17:32:00,135,Think Tamagami  Combine Fishing for Lake Trout and whitefish with some of the nicest and Romantic settings available at that time of the year.  There are a few great spots up that that can offer you some great get-away packages.  Enjoy
128934,irishfield,2007-11-01 19:14:00,26272," Remember...you can only fish Lake Temagami itself, for Lakers, from Feb 15th to Mar 15th. All the others in the area are Jan1  to Sept 30...or at least they were..scuttlebutt was the new regs were going to make the whole area one month only."
128971,tdotfisherman,2007-11-01 20:56:00,317,"Fantastic decision Lyra. Niagara winter fishing is where it's at, and your boyfriend won't be disappointed at all.. I think I'll ""accidentally"" let my girlfriend read this thread, and maybe I'll get the Christmas present I've been hoping for.."
