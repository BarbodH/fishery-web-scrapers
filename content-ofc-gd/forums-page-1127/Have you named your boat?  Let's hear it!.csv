Went home to pick up bly and then high tailed it to Hamilton to pick up our boat.  We met Gerritt there and he was awesome...helping to lift the boat from the old trailer to new one and setting up the bunks on the new one so that we'd have a nice safe drive home.  I'd also like to thank all those who sent PM's on leads for used ones.  Anyhow, now that we have it, we figure we should name our boat.  We have not picked a name as of yet, so if anyone has suggestions we'd like to hear them!  Also, I know naming boats is quite common, so if you've named your boat, let's hear it....as well as an explanation as to why you picked that name!!!"

After he and Big Cliff tore the boat and trailer all apart and refurbished her we had to come up with a name and seeing as how she was still a dented old piece of tin can the name seemed to fit...  "
