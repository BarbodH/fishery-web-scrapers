She spies a ship that she figures contains riches beyond her dreams and she boards it with weapons in hand...a battle ensues!   She emerges victorious and gives the classic ""Har...you cant beat me"" pose....   After pushing all aboard into the vast ocean, she takes off with her new found bounty.   Sorry for the NF post, but fishing reports have slowed down a bit....LOL."

128671,Deano,2007-11-01 01:56:00,767,"That comes with being captain of your ship, you now have to watch out for pirates. LOL I've heard some pirates take a liking to ice cream, so you may be able to make a deal to get your ship back.  Priceless."
