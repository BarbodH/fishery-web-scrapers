128639,Deano,2007-11-01 01:19:00,767,"""Did you see the size of those meatballs? Those alone would account for the high caloric intake.""  Yeah the meatballs were quarter pounders. LOL  If I listened to health Canada ""drink 8 cups of water every day"" I'd never be hungry cause i'd be so bloated with water, and I'd get so much exercise running back and fourth to the washroom. LOL  I think I rather have a heart attack anyways, better than spending the last 10 years of your life in diapers, in a home, depending on everyone else to take care of you."
