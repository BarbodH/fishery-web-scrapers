Each of us was selected from their respective units to participate All units are usually looking for volunteers and more then willing to have a look It is a rewarding passtime and something I would imagine I will stay with until I cant stand up anyway It does have a large adrenalin factor I wont lie But when it all comes down we are out there for you   Thanks Peter  P.S. Wayne im going to unlock the tourney board so you can drop your pictures on it.........by the way nice haul of ski's"
