I noticed the Eramosa River runs right through town and was curious if any members have fished it and could offer up some insight.  Should I be targeting trout or is this a bass/pike laden river.  Any thoughts would be great.  Thanks,  Corn Nug"
128624,wallacio,2007-11-01 00:24:00,475,The Eramosa primarily contains bass and small pike though there are trout in the upper sections.   You should be aware that trout season closed on Sept 30th in S. Ontario (with extended seasons open on some Great Lakes tributaries).
