127840,Joey,2007-10-29 16:57:00,9122,"Met up with a few fellow OFNr's who were lucky enough to win seats to the private airing of the new Dave Mercer Facts of Fishing ""The Show"" and all I have to say is it's going to be a big HIT!!!  It was done very well and it was absolutely hilarious, and Dave actually caught fish too  Popcorn and drinks were served to us for the show and then after the show we were treated to Subway subs.  Here's the pics I took.  TJ and Cliff also took some so I'm sure they'll be up later.               TJ was so excited he could barely contain himself.  Thanks for ruining the picture *$%^&    Can't wait for the first show, which airs December 5 at 7 p.m.  Don't miss it that's for sure.  Cheers,  Joey"

127870,mikeymikey,2007-10-29 18:50:00,376,Main camera operator for his show is lucky guy too. I believe he is actually one of OFC member. I am sure you've seen his home made fishing video (carp) long time ago here.  I hope he still is the camera operator.
127893,The Urban Fisherman,2007-10-29 20:33:00,2050,"Thanks for the kind words Joey - I'm glad you enjoyed the show! I know Dave appreciates everybody's support. As most of you know I'm part of the crew and the editor for the show, and we all worked hard for a long time putting it together.  I haven't been able to get onto the board as much lately because of all the work but I was TOTALLY stoked to finally meet some of you guys today at the premiere!  Hopefully next time we meet up it'll be on the water!  cheers, Ryan"

Great pics Joey...I dont really have any to add here....after seeing TJ like that I think they would pale in comparison...LOL.  Great seeing you again!
