128527,HIMTI,2007-10-31 18:46:00,33,Can i have two lines in the water at the same time? What i mean to do is to put a rod on stand and throw jigs from the other one.
128528,rickster,2007-10-31 18:47:00,495,NOPE
128529,Gerritt,2007-10-31 18:52:00,6129,depends on where you are fishing.
128535,HIMTI,2007-10-31 19:23:00,33,Downtown Toronto from shore..
128536,bigfish1965,2007-10-31 19:24:00,3382,"The answer then is no. From a boat you can but not from shore. I know, it makes no sense."
128537,misfish,2007-10-31 19:27:00,29133,Rick I cant find where it says you cant. Lake Ontario is lake ontario. I dont see why not.  We need an ask the CO
128538,bigfish1965,2007-10-31 19:32:00,3382,Under the general exceptions it says you can fish with two rods from a boat.
128539,Photoz,2007-10-31 19:35:00,792,"I've been present SEVERAL TIMES when guys fishing Lake Ontario for carp, with 2 rods were picked off . . .     definitely a no-no, unless in a boat or on the ice!"
128541,misfish,2007-10-31 19:40:00,29133,Thank you. Found it. NO
128542,bigfish1965,2007-10-31 19:41:00,3382,Page 8 in section b of the regs found here http://www.mnr.gov.on.ca/MNR/pubs/fishing/...ap_B_fr2005.pdf states..
128543,TJQ,2007-10-31 19:43:00,7806,Ya know....  that makes no sense at all to me...
128546,HIMTI,2007-10-31 19:46:00,33,Thanks soo much for the responses. I guess its a no..no for two rods.
128561,ccmtcanada,2007-10-31 20:24:00,7971,"I asked this last year, and it seems that if you're say standing on a pier, you can have one line.  Drop your canoe in the water 1 foot from where you were standing and two is ok...LOL"
