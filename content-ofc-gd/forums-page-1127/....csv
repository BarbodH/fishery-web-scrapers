128814,cranks bait,2007-11-01 13:29:00,721,Yes it is a cruel world.  For me I find Saturdays get added to that list as well.  Unfortunately I cannot call in sick.  I do however get to stare out the window of our store and druel over the sunny light rippled water at one of my fishing spots all freakin' day long.  Only to have the weather go to crap as soon as I get out.
