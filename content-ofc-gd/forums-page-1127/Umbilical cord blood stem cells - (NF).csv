Wondering if any of you have gone down this path and could share experience/opinion on it? It is quite pricey but maybe good insurance policy for the future?  Here is a short list of places in Canada that do this kind of stuff: http://parentsguidecordblood.org/content/u...istcanada.shtml  Cheers, Ice Fisherman"

128507,bigfish1965,2007-10-31 17:51:00,3382,The blood from the umbilical cord contains stem cells. These cells can be used to treat many potentially lethal illnesses and can be used in place of a bone marrow transplant. Parents sometimes save these just in case something befalls their child and they need this type of remedy.
128508,douG,2007-10-31 17:52:00,2693,"When your baby is born, the blood contained in the umbilical cord (maybe placenta too, I don't know) is full of stem cells.  These are the most basic and versatile of human cells, and can be used to treat a whole bunch of ills since they can change to be anything from bone marrow to liver cells.  They are genetically suited to help your new baby or even other family members recover from things like radiation treatment for cancer."
