We talk about fishing in general, we talk about RAVEN and we promote guiding.   Well one day I was fishing and I meet this guy who was a member of a Chinese fishing club, one thing led to another and they ask Raven and myself to to set up a talk on float fishing and everything that goes on with it.  Well Last night Bowshep and I did the seminar, and we had them from the start to the finish.  We talked about the sport itself, we talked about safety, and we talked about Ethics and conservation.. Our talk was to last 1 1/2 hrs but went over to 3-4 hrs.  It was great.  Here is a pic that was taken last night at 11:20 pm,  now all the member that was there are not in the pic, but a good number are...     I would like to that the Canadian Chinese Anglers Club for having us out and I look forward to another talk in the future  Dave  P.s  Thank You Ken for your help,  you always make things interesting and fun.."

128813,DMASSE,2007-11-01 13:25:00,420,"CCMT  Didnt see Kens post,   He was trying to say Hi in Chinese, but it was the wrong version LOL  Kinda funny,  All in all it was fun and I hope they learned something that will help them on the river  Dave"
128817,bigfish1965,2007-11-01 13:38:00,3382,"Cantonese- Hello is 'Nay Ho' with a slight up-note inflection on the 'ho'. Mandarin- Hello is 'Nee How' said pretty much straight. Most Chinese in Canada are from Hong Kong and speak Cantonese. Mainlanders speak primarily Mandarin, but there are all kinds of dialects and regional languages as you can imagine with a culture that is thousands of years old.  Can you tell I work in a casino??"
128847,linweir,2007-11-01 15:00:00,202,"Dave  Thank you and Ken so much. You guys gave us a good seminar. I told Raven you did great work. I appreciate your work to promote ""Catch & Release"", whcih is critcal to all anglers and our kids."
