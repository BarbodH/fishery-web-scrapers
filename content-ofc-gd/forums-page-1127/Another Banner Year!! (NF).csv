126465,oxcowboy,2007-10-24 22:22:00,544,awesome job tj.  im not sure which would get my heart pounding more the fresh moose droppings or face to face with the timberwolf !  im sure you had a blast.  jason
126477,Whopper,2007-10-24 22:37:00,2174,"Glad you had a good time TJ Been to the Husky lol, first time I ever had gravy on my fries.  Cheers"
126543,danc,2007-10-25 00:25:00,4677," LOL Phil. I can't remember the last time I didn't have gravy of my fries. It's a Canadian thing.  Beauty report TJ. Obviously you had a riot, and that's what it's all about. And, you should have just grabbed the chicken to go at the Nipigon Husky. You must have seen some of my discarded bones on the side of the highway as a testimonial. Great report TJ."
128413,bobq,2007-10-31 12:08:00,15,"Take a walk on the wild side,  or maybe just visit the room. "
128763,dsn,2007-11-01 11:13:00,1018,If I went hunting on my own I'd say hey look fresh chestnuts!! LOL 
128803,TJQ,2007-11-01 13:05:00,7806,LOL...  Ive never tried them....  I wonder what they would taste like.. probably crap... lol
128848,jedimaster,2007-11-01 15:01:00,3472,  Man you guys surely should have brought up food...  Sounds like a great hunt can't wait for mine next week.
126343,TJQ,2007-10-24 16:36:00,7806,"Well...  this was my tenth anniversary going on this particular trip.. It was a bit cut short this year due to some of the partys scheduling conflicts but we ""got 'er dun"" anyway.  The weather certainly didn't cooperate though, it was very warm and rainy for much of the trip (Although.. I cleaned up on the fishing side bets, the crib side bets and finally the Texas Hold 'em..  lol.. by the end of that day nobody was talking to me....  ) and game wasn't moving around as much as it could have been.  However, that being said it was the first year we filled our moose tag.  We generally don't hunt for moose till all the deer tags are filled but this year one of the guys was in the right place at the right time and we got a nice bull moose.  The deer hunting was very slow, no lack of deer, tons and tons of sign, but the chances for shooting were few and far between at the beginning of the hunt.  It should be a banner year for any one hunting a bit later.  We wound up with three deer, not a banner year, but still meat on the table.  Combined with the moose, thats around 200 lbs of meat for the freezer per man this year, which makes up for the lack of deer (LOL... um.. I think were gonna pay a bit more attention to the moose hunting from now on.)  For those of you traveling out west  DO NOT stop to eat at the Husky in Nipigon if your looking to make time...  we stopped for a quick lunch on the way back that took 1.5 hours in a restaurant that wasn't busy... and we all ordered the same thing.  Anyway heres some pictures of the adventure.. all told we saw/jumped 8 moose and 23 deer.  I personally had my first walking encounter with a VERY LARGE timber wolf...  i looked over my shoulder the rest of that day ill tell ya.  We also watched a black bear sit on the railway tracks and watch my buddy on his stand for 15 min.. before I ran down the tracks and scared him away.  Heres the moose from where it was shot... back to camp.. and then to the butchers in Fort Frances.                My favourite watch.     Big Buck Bob AKA Moz... in his new tree stand.    Nice fresh moose droppings!!    I was bored and took this picture of Betty Lou.    Moz getting the finer points of skinning...      Ahhh... deer tenderloin at the camp in salt pepper and onions...  melts in your mouth!!    At this point I was outta breath.....    Bestest camp mouse trap ever!!    Bye Bye till next year....  booooo hoooooo.....    Some scenery shots on the way home...      And the fun begins....      Even the meat mans gotta take a break!!    Well thats it till next year.. I can't wait to go back..."

126390,bigbuck,2007-10-24 18:56:00,2449,"After eating at the Husky in Cochrane last summer, I'd say stay away!!! Marino's on the side of 17 in Marathon is pretty good, we stayed at his hotel/motel/no-tell a couple of years ago on the way to Kenora. Further up there's a Robin's Donuts/KFC if I'm not mistaken but the name of the town escapes me. Nice shot of Betty Lou. Was it her that took down the Moose??"
126392,huntervasili,2007-10-24 19:04:00,1604,Looks like ya enjoyed yourself TJ... Nothing better than a good time with friends and some meat in the freezer
126409,TJQ,2007-10-24 19:54:00,7806," A moose is a moose by any other name is a mooses moose.    When your walking and they are wet and glistening, ie that fresh, it gets the heart a pounding...    Rickster, nope not outta your spot.. accross in back of the camp.   Thanks Jen, its hard to tell ya how much I enjoy that place...   Ha ha....  but ya.....    Peanut butter and Jam!!    Nope... poor Betty Lou didn't get to bark an anything this year... first time in five or six years she doesn't"
