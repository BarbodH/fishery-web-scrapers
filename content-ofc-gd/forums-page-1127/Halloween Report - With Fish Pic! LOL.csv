Sugarpacket dressed up as a fisherman, which really turned my crank  LOL    SLAP that should be a Busch can!  After a while of fishing in Simcoe duck park I managed this fish. Typical colors for a sewage outflow fish. LOL    Sugarpacket couldn't wait to get it home and eat it. Looks tasty!    lol, happy halloween everyone!"
