Lonnie used to live not too far from me and we had talked several years ago about pier walleye...he often fishes the same spot as I (a stones throw from where your fish in your avatar was caught). It was a very informative article and well written as is all of his stuff. If you have big water and a big pier, you will catch walleye. Finding a pattern takes time and patience, but Lonnie outlined the basics quite well."
