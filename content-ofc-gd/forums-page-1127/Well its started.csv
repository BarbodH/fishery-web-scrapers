Went to thank him by getting him a Islander Cp and thats were l met Dmasse... Have not looked back since. With their help and a lot of research on and off the water... lots of practice... l wanted to be a Pro Fisher Person.  Well last night it started Dave and l gave a Float Fishing presentation to the Chinese Sportsmen club and it was a great sucsess... l am so pleased that it went very well. With a combination of group and one on one instruction the two hour slot time went to 3.5 hr's... everyone stayed, no one fell asleep...  l will now be going after my Guiding lic. . l'm still working on my Flyfishing Masters, l was over ambitious about have it by now but hey l had to start somewhere. l will be doing this with a conservation mind and l will be active in the protection of our rivers  l'm not a Pro yet put the garden gate is open and the path is before me.  l would like to thank Mike and Dave for this dream of mine. But most of all l would like to Thank Nancy for believing in me and suporting me in my dream. Damn l love my life  .      Peace Ken"

Even I, thanks to both of you, am able to use a centrepin, am learning the skills of fly and float fishing and am amazing myself.  This says much for you both as I am just not a coordinated person...in fact I walked into my screen patio door last night and have the marks on my nose to prove it. Great stuff you guys."
