128284,Terry,2007-10-31 00:04:00,14456,LOL I only had 5 minutes if you want the whole body  I need 10 minutes
128287,PatrickGG,2007-10-31 00:07:00,562,Never mind the fish i like the avatar better.
128289,danc,2007-10-31 00:08:00,4677,  I know you can do better Terry. I just couldn't resist Bud...
128291,irishfield,2007-10-31 00:09:00,26272, Yah..and to think Charlotte had to go....
128299,John Bacon,2007-10-31 00:20:00,3277,  I think after you catch the exact same fish that way eight times in six different lakes in two different provinces it becomes legal.  Last I saw of that fish my niece's boy friend showed me an email with pictures of the new Ontario record pike from Rainy Lake.  Too bad he is not hear to see this thread.
128303,danc,2007-10-31 00:26:00,4677, Geez John. Get with the program. We're up to 4 provinces now. Rainy was 4 lakes and 2 provinces ago.
128307,douG,2007-10-31 00:38:00,2693,"Nasty, Terry.  Nice work, but nasty nonetheless."
128314,Crazyhook,2007-10-31 00:46:00,1154,Congrats on getting Connected to the Internet man!  welcome!
128320,Rizzo,2007-10-31 00:53:00,4754,I knew it.  I avoided opening this post for a long time (knowing it would be that dang EURO-PIKE again) but curiosity got the better of me.  Kind of like that scab you shouldn't pick but can't resist.  You know its gonna bleed but do it anyways.
128323,tdotfisherman,2007-10-31 00:58:00,317,No matter how many times I come across those pictures online I never get tired of them.. what an unbelievable fish...
128340,joonmoon,2007-10-31 01:45:00,528,
128376,tizfun,2007-10-31 04:58:00,292,Oh my God !!!!!!!!!!!    My cousin who live is Arizona just emailed me the exact pics and said that his nieces husbands brother caught it while fishing on Rainy Lake..  He said it was the new Canadian record..  I replied back with some of the other peoples records with the same pics...  He seemed ticked that he had been lied too...  Go figure !!!!!!!!!  Tiz
128437,kennyman,2007-10-31 13:01:00,737,NOT AGAIN!! Had this sent to me last night as well.
128438,ccmtcanada,2007-10-31 13:02:00,7971,"As much as it's old news to us, I have relatives who know I fish (but dont fish themselves) send me the same pictures all the time.  It's easy to get tricked...and perfectly understandable."
128603,TangerineDream,2007-10-31 22:54:00,47,Too bad the Manitoba record is 59 inches....
128120,JorgeCarlos,2007-10-30 16:11:00,109,"This is the new record in Canada. He caught it on the Winnipeg River,by Seven Sisters, in Manitoba. (Just North East of Winnipeg). Check this thing out.. The last picture is unbelievable! This guy (in the photos below), was fishing and caught a 36"" Pike - as he was reeling it in, a 56"" Pike tried to eat it!!!!!  He brought them both in at the same time in the same net. Awesome catch on a river in Canada - 55lbs-56 inches.     "
128121,Sherriff,2007-10-30 16:12:00,252,"Hoax...............Real fish, but not from Canada and not anytime recent....  Sherriff"
128122,ccmtcanada,2007-10-30 16:12:00,7971,
128123,Muskieman,2007-10-30 16:15:00,2472,"Sorry dude!!  that's a european pike , they catch those there regularly.. you can see some of them on youtube  nice big fish nonetheless.."
128125,wallyboss,2007-10-30 16:16:00,1095,"Who says that Catch and release doesn't work.   that guy has caught that fish weekly for the past couple of years, and all in different waters.  Maybe there is  underground   tunnels between all the lakes.  If everything we read on the internet would be true!~!@!!!!"
128126,BFSC Kevin,2007-10-30 16:17:00,1351,been on this board atleast 4 times since this board was moved to this sever(?) last november gigantic fish still though
128127,ccmtcanada,2007-10-30 16:17:00,7971,Boy that guy fishes everywhere in the world and catches the same damn fish....what are the chances?
128129,Zib,2007-10-30 16:21:00,369,That fish wasn't caught in the Winnipeg River. I caught it in my swimming pool just last week.  
128138,snag,2007-10-30 16:55:00,1932,"Can't we lock these threads!  Dude, you have no idea how many times this guy has been immortilized here!  and where-oh-where did you get the story from?  Thanks anyways!"
128143,Terry,2007-10-30 17:05:00,14456,man that thing just will not go away.. and you can't blame the people posting it....they get the info from a friend and believe it to be true
128144,Meely,2007-10-30 17:10:00,282,"Nice fish.....  Would it be considered a ""legally caught"" fish if it in fact was not hooked in the mouth and just ""swooped"" up into a landing net??  Curious......  Meely"
128146,Roy,2007-10-30 17:22:00,13728,Wow! What a fish. I've never seen one that big from the Winnipeg River. They usually come from every other country except Nigeria.
128154,sharper,2007-10-30 18:24:00,279, 
128158,keram,2007-10-30 18:33:00,585, You got that right  . The only thing that will got my attention is that somebody claim it was caught in Scugog ( just north of Goreski's)
128165,Landlocked,2007-10-30 18:57:00,171,Reminds me of that black dog that everyone swerves to avoid and ends up making an insurance claim....a very well travelled dog that shows up across the country
128193,JorgeCarlos,2007-10-30 19:50:00,109,"like Terry said it i got it from some friend and i thought was interesting enough to post here,i did not know that thing its been around world and back,if someone got mad too bad"
128198,TJQ,2007-10-30 20:01:00,7806,LOL...  Lockit lock lock.
128239,mepps,2007-10-30 21:55:00,1301,Does anyone have the Esox magazine with this guy??
128240,Roy,2007-10-30 21:57:00,13728,I have it Clive. It's the winter 06/07 edition.  I might also add that in that same issue of The Next Bite Esox Angler magazine is our very own JP Bushey and Raf and Sandy Turk (Graftongal). It's a super issue.
128242,irishfield,2007-10-30 22:05:00,26272,Yep...like Roy said and I believe it was also in the In Fisherman as well.
128243,Deano,2007-10-30 22:06:00,767,That explains why I already had these pics. LOL
128249,Terry,2007-10-30 22:25:00,14456,I did some searching on the internet and I think this is the real fish....he he   
128263,steverowbotham,2007-10-30 22:54:00,1800,why wont this just disappear !?!?!?!
128267,John Glynn,2007-10-30 23:06:00,25,This is the real story about this fish.  http://www.pacgb.co.uk/articles/blomedit.htm
128274,danc,2007-10-30 23:24:00,4677, You're right Terry. The real fish was caught by a guy that had lost his right hip in a childhood accident. On the farm.
