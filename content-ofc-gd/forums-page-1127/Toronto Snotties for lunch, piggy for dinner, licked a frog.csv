128132,snag,2007-10-30 16:35:00,1932,"I was on the islands when I heard:  ""Lick my back""  What? who said that? I looked down to see an enormous frog perched atop a large boulder   ""I'm from the amazon, lick my back""  I said O.K. (I didn't want to offend our Brazillian guest)  Then I saw these strange sights.        Then the snotties attacked!     Then a piggy fer dinner (I'm laughing because a boat load of tourists were FREAKING out behind me)  Next day (Dollarama slama)     Hunchback or the rare ""camel pike""Sorry for the vertical, I just removed the hook      My master beckons  Good bye."

128196,Greencoachdog,2007-10-30 19:56:00,8163,"Great report and pics (how many times have I told you about tryin' to take a pic with the sun at your back???)!!!   That wasn't a stag party you described, that was my ex-wifes family from Gasden Alabama!      I always knew you were an' ol' ""Toad Licker""!"
128201,solopaddler,2007-10-30 20:09:00,8605,Nice report bud. Did you drag that frog out there with you? LOL!
128202,snag,2007-10-30 20:12:00,1932," Sorry about the mix up.  I lick frogs, not toads. That's disgusting."
128208,Roy,2007-10-30 20:34:00,13728, Yeah...and that's something else I've been meaning to talk to you about....
128213,dsn,2007-10-30 20:47:00,1018,"wow thats amazing SNAG look at those bellies!!! They are ""FAT!!!!""   dsn"
128234,Photoz,2007-10-30 21:40:00,792,"Great report . . .   even better shots! One of these days I'ma gonna try my luck at the pike . . . .   but I DO like my perch & trout! Just for curiousity, I have a medium 7' Fenwick, medium 9' Berkley & a heavy 10.5' Shimano . . . .     all with Stradics on 'em . . . .   which would you use for the pike?"
128237,mepps,2007-10-30 21:52:00,1301,nicely done bro!
128282,Joey,2007-10-30 23:45:00,9122,"Great report Snag, I've missed your humorous posts.  Keep them up will ya  Joey"
128285,PatrickGG,2007-10-31 00:04:00,562,"The Hunchback of pikerdame, Nice fall time urban snot rockets and a awesome report snag."
128310,mattyk,2007-10-31 00:43:00,2110,"nice report, thanks for sharing."
128359,snag,2007-10-31 03:20:00,1932," Hey Photoz,  Here's the funny thing.  I recently became seperated from my 2500 stradic and 7' browning medium heavy. I fish HEAVY weeds so I have a 6'2"" bps tourney special that use to be a 6'6"" before a car door bit it. The reel is an Abu cardinal $23 from Cantire. (I will be up-grading again soon)  I find shorter rods rip the weeds easier. However, if all you have are mediums then go with the shimano. This time of year the pike are deeper and that rod will be awesome for those further casts.  I've been using some musky baits too."
128361,snag,2007-10-31 03:31:00,1932," How's the sleep?!!!  Babies crying, just kidding!  Can you believe that you can go to work like a Total Zombie and they still employ you??? Boggles the mind man.  I smell a poopy diaper amigo and it's your turn to change it!  "
128390,Dano,2007-10-31 09:47:00,719,"Hmmmm, must be mass halucination as we are all seeing what you did.....  Nice pike man!"
128433,007,2007-10-31 12:53:00,537,That's gotta be the one of the weirdest starts to one of your reports yet?!  Looks like you're still getting some good GTA pike action.  I've not had any luck with the pike recently.  Is there still a good chance of catching one in November along the lakefront before I leave these shores? If you want a fishing companion in the next few weeks let me know!  007
128819,snag,2007-11-01 13:40:00,1932," November and December are excellent months. Just go deep and a little slower. Use a suspending deep diver, large spoon and a large spinner. I use most of my musky baits now.  Terrible weather is your friend."
