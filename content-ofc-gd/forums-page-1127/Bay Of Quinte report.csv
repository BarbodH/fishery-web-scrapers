128321,pikeie,2007-10-31 00:54:00,380,"well during the auction for Tyler last winter, tinbanger bid on a full day charter on either lake ontario for salmon or the Bay Of Quinte in the fall for walleye with U and Me charters U and ME fishing charters. well tinbanger won the bidding and now we had to decide on when to go? summer salmon and trout, or cold fall and GIANT walleye  lol. so after having to cancel one saturday due to the horrible weather we got fishing the next sunday! tinbanger and i were so stoked about this trip we could hardly wait.  although our day started with cell phone time being adjusted back one hour resulting in us waking at 5:30 am in Kingston ...the time we were to be on the road to picton Out of the house in 5 minutes with one stop for coffee ( UGH ! McDonalds coffee)  we met up with Lloyd at the picton marina at 6:30 and were on the water instantly. the morning was nice, not to windy but it was sure cold out, glad we brought the floater suits lol. this would be our  first time really fishing for BOQ walleye, we were hoping to learn a few things out there. But we were'nt expecting to learn so much! shortly after all the lines are set the one rigger gets a hit but no hookup, i told tinbanger he could have first fish but he kept disagreeing with me lol, shortly after that first hit we get another on one of the planer boards, i tell tinbanger its his fish and he takes the rod! http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v302/pik...pg?t=1193788323  after a nice strong fight the first fish in the boat is a..... http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v302/pik...pg?t=1193788580 sheepshead lol  so now i get next fish, after trolling around for a bit another line gets hit and I'm up.  http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v302/pik...pg?t=1193788996 after a few nice headshakes and bulldogging to bottom we get our first glimpse of the fish and its gold!!! into the net he goes and a measurment shows him at 27 inches my new PB.(he had a hook in the gills, so he was kept) http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v302/pik...pg?t=1193788946  so we turn around and start to go back down and tinbanger is now in the hot seat. tinbanger is staring at the one rigger rod and the tip starts a' bouncin, he goes up sets the hook and he says ""it feels the same as the last one"" lol http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v302/pik...pg?t=1193789188 and another bah bah bah lol http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v302/pik...pg?t=1193789286 lol does'nt he look happy lol  so I'm up in the hot seat waitin for a fish, we are marking lots and lots of fish down too deep but some are coming up on the sonar to take a look at the baits, but nada. o well. finally the one planer goes off and i'm up, after just as long a fight as the first one (man there is a lot of line behind that boat lol) i get my second walleye in the boat measuring in at 24 inches, this ones goes in the live well with the first one. http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v302/pik...pg?t=1193789579  sorry for the one dead fish pic, but like said above he wasnt going to survive and he did'nt. http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v302/pik...pg?t=1193789604  tinbanger is up agian and the lake is getting alot rougher with the waves rising constanly, but we stuck it out. now tinbangers getting a good case of ribbin from me and Lloyd lol callin him the sheepie master and such lol, when the next rigger went off we were joking around that he probably got another sheppie lol well guess what.... he did lol http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v302/pik...pg?t=1193789879 the sheepie master strikes agian lol  so now with the waves getting even bigger i was up, time was running out and we hoped my streak would continue lol. so get this, i am sitting there watchng the one rigger rod bounce around in the waves wondering how the heck i am susposed to tell that a fish hit lol, so im sitting there watching the rod and Lloyd says""fish on"" i was like ""huh where"", he gets up and checks the rigger rod and sure enough there is some resistance lol he sure knows what he is looking for! so this fish did not want to come up and kept diving deeper and deeper with lots of head shakes thrown in lol were are betting on another walleye lol so i finally start to bring the fish up and there is that gold flash lol how crazy is that lol tinbanger gets all the sheepies and i get all the walleyes lol, so i get the fish close to the boat and the net is under her! i couldnt belive the size of this fish! i know lots of bigger ones are caught in the bay every yer but i have never seen such a big walleye in person http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v302/pik...pg?t=1193790337 this PIG measured in at just over 30"" and we never weighed her as we wanted he back as quick as posible, she took off really strong back down to the depths as i watched he swim away. Lloyd estimated the fish to be 10 lbs and that would make my new Personal Best!! i still cant belive that i got a double diget walleye lol  .  after that fish we started to bring in the lines and get ready to go as it was getting rougher and our charter was over. this will be a fishing trip that tinbanger and i will not soon forget. Lloyd was a great host and a VERY nice guy, he is a good conservationist avoiding fishing the deep water  and making sure the fish we release swim off strong and lively to be caught again. we would recommend hooking up with a charter like Lloyd U and ME fishing charters to anyone any time looking to experience some fishing of a lifetime and learn a lot as well ( like I don't have enough lures)  .  Maybe a summer Salmon charter next summer"

128339,Joey,2007-10-31 01:44:00,9122,Great report and pics Pikie.  I can't wait to get there myself soon.  Joey
128347,iceguy,2007-10-31 02:18:00,341,"Nice Eye's Pikie, those fish are freaks that come out of that bay, walleyes are scrappy but you won't be sorry with salmon charter,Nicer weather and fish that test your drag system. That's next summer and Quinte is now. Good report."
128379,motv8tr,2007-10-31 06:27:00,2587,"Excellent report Pikie, I'm glad you guys had a great time, and congrats on the new PB's!!  Maureen"
128389,Dano,2007-10-31 09:44:00,719,"Nice fish, gotta love those big eyes huh? Congrats on the PB! Lloyd is a great guy to go out with."
128391,misfish,2007-10-31 09:49:00,29133,"AWESOME REPORT BUD.   Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh,never mind."
128409,superdad,2007-10-31 11:50:00,353,Nice report about the Quinte Eyes and sheepies...
128420,mattyk,2007-10-31 12:23:00,2110,"real nice report, thanks for sharing it with us."
128421,ccmtcanada,2007-10-31 12:23:00,7971,Way to go Pikie!! Some great looking eyes there.  Hopefully I can catch a few for the G2G coming up soon!
128429,007,2007-10-31 12:43:00,537,Great Report and congrats on the PB.  Looks like a great day with lots of big fish.  Why is it people don't like catching Drum (sheepshead)?  From all accounts they are a sizeable fish and put up a good fight - surely everything a catch and release fisherman could ask for?
128448,tinbanger,2007-10-31 14:09:00,1028,Who doesn't like catching Drum They put up a decent fight and it's better than nothing tb
128450,Headhunter,2007-10-31 14:14:00,5703,"Well, I for one certainly don't like catchin Drum, aka Sheepie, aka Water Goat!  I guess the same logic as why trout guys don't like catchin Suckers, bass guys don't want gobies etc... Yah, they fight, but they are not a game fish and the time it takes to bring them in, get up-hooked and outta the net, my bait may well have been in front of a nice double digit Eye! HH"
128504,fishindevil,2007-10-31 17:44:00,6254,WOW....Great catch !!!!! thats some real nice bay of quinte walleyes for sure   nice pics too....cheers
128533,Bly,2007-10-31 19:02:00,1556,"Congrats on the new PB!   Very nice looking walleyes   Tinbanger, nice that you let him have all the walleye  007...  Drum are fun to catch but not so much when you are targeting something else."
128560,huntervasili,2007-10-31 20:23:00,1604,Thanks for sharing... looks like you had some fun out there and glad to see the eyes being pulled in more and more
128623,Clampet,2007-11-01 00:20:00,1947,"Well, you were doing something right, that's fer sure. You did better than most who've been out lately."
128630,tinbanger,2007-11-01 00:46:00,1028,"did something right for sure ...went out with someone who knew what to do right!.  As far as the drum went , they are ok to catch . Pleased thatthe young fella got somenice nice eyes couldn't have planned it better.  TB"
128824,Meely,2007-11-01 13:47:00,282,McDonalds???  Wait til I tell the boss.......
