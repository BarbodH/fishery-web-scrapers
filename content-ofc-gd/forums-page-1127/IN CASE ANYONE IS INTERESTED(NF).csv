These Tactical Flashlights feature 5 Light Modes making the flash light an all-in-one flashlight that will get any job done. The Hard Case Tactical LED Infrared Flashlight by Energizer emits light in White, Red, Blue, Infrared, and Infrared Strobe. The Flashlight's White Light outputs a bright high- intensity LED for maximum brightness. This light is bright enough to temporarily blind an assailant for a couple of seconds. The Red and Blue Lights on these Flashlights are great for close work, tracking, and also navigating through outdoor terrain as some animals cannot see red light. The Infrared, and Infrared Strobe Lights are designed primarily for Night Vision equipment. The Infrared Light, when used with Night Vision Goggles, will help light up an entire area that is in total darkness. This is ideal for tactical missions, hunting, or any other activity where Nightvision use will come in handy. These lights of Hard Case Tactical Flashlights run on 2 AA Batteries.
