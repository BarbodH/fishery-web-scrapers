326186,kickingfrog,2009-04-04 15:02:00,8333,"That's exactly what I was thinking this morning... and Monday, when I woke-up to snow.    Glad I didn't put my snowbrush/scrapper away yet."
326187,misfish,2009-04-04 15:09:00,29133,"Ya, those musky guys eh."
326192,OhioFisherman,2009-04-04 15:13:00,6623,LOL April Fool ! Weather here for Tuesday is a low of 31f and a high of 32f? why bother noting the difference? Snow too. But 10 degrees warmer for Wednesday. Still way to early to count on anything as far as weather. Thought you guys didn`t put the snow blowers away until June?  Doesn`t bass and muskie season not open till late June so you don`t get snowed on?
326194,danbouck,2009-04-04 15:21:00,4380,No snow here!
326196,Skud,2009-04-04 15:22:00,739,Well at least all that rain yesterday and the wind last night and today will clear up Simcoe of ice. Time to unpack the boat for some perching.
326198,misfish,2009-04-04 15:25:00,29133,"Havent been to see the bay yet,but yer right Doug."

326490,lew,2009-04-05 11:16:00,12766,"Sorry for bringing the curse down on ya Brian, it wasn't my intention, but I've got a couple snow shovels sittin in the basement all clean & shiny if you need to borrow them"
