326421,Cudz,2009-04-05 02:17:00,2652,Leafs let the Habs win so the season series would be tied at 3 a piece.  Yeah that's the ticket.
326535,jediangler,2009-04-05 14:21:00,1923,"The Leafs are going to be hard pressed to get this many points next year. Still at least two more years till they'll be in playoff contention, doesn't matter how many college players they sign."

326538,Handlebarz,2009-04-05 14:27:00,3790,they are just trying to get the best draft pick they can for this year so that they can trade him off for some one else on there last leg and a 2nd round pick for lets say 2046 that sounds about right.
326540,kemper,2009-04-05 14:31:00,2232,  beat me to it
326555,irishfield,2009-04-05 15:15:00,26272,"Ref calls.. lack there of, or calling the wrong team for the penalty cost the leafs at least 2 goals... and what Roy said !"
326563,nancur373,2009-04-05 15:40:00,1211,Habs finally decided to play.
326574,Cookslav,2009-04-05 16:03:00,1457,"Lets see what happens first round ""if"" they make the playoffs. They beat the Leaf 3 out of 6 match ups...And the leafs are not a premier team by any stretch of the imagination this year.  The Habs have won 3 in a row since loosing to...yup the Leafs And look who they beat for those 3 Games I'll give Em credit for beating Chicago, but The Islanders, and the leafs were the last 2 games.  They have to face Ottawa, The Rangers, Boston, and Pittsburg yet so they actually have a fairly difficult end to the season. Minus Ottawa of course...  Montreal is a one line team...Not enough depth and that dog just ain't hunt come play off time(if they make it) If they could just clone Tanquay about 6 times over they might stand a chance LOL!"
