There's a small bridge over the road and therefore a current pinch.  Open water within 150 yards of where we were fishing.... on 2.5' of solid ice     Caught some walleye, including this nice fat female.  Full of eggs, released of course so she can spawn in another month.  Check out the blue tinge on her tail.  "

326482,trapshooter,2009-04-05 07:45:00,1234,"  Hey Jacques, I didn't measure her but I'm guessing she was an easy 5lbs.  I just wanted to get her and her eggs back in the lake"

326955,trapshooter,2009-04-06 13:22:00,1234," That's when it went out last year.  It can be gone by Mid april though, just depends on the winter.  This one, and last, were both long and cold."
