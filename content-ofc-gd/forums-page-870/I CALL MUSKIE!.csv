326610,Roy,2009-04-05 17:54:00,13728,"Just looked for the first time at your signature link, Raf. Some really good info there that everyone should read. Thanks."
326999,Raf,2009-04-06 15:27:00,3495,"Thanks Roy.  It's still a little ""ugly"" but the info's there nevertheless.  Hope some can make use of it."
327045,spyder3g,2009-04-06 16:44:00,50,"The main difference between musky & pike is not a colour or stripes. It's a number of filtration holes in the snout. Muskie  has 9,  pike has 6"
327058,Roy,2009-04-06 17:11:00,13728," Just as a matter of interest, the holes in the lower jaw of both the pike and the muskie are not filtration holes but rather a part of their sensory system."
326249,Skud,2009-04-04 17:09:00,739,"I didn't want to hijack a great report/thread so I start this one to debate on the small fish Limeyangler caught. I believe it be a muskie so I post pics to back up my thoughts. #1 - Pike are dark green in colour with white, irregular spots from the size of 6 inches to 50 inches. Here are some pictures of mine from the past years. #2 - Muskie are light in colour with dark strips, bars and spots. The patterns vary and change as the fish grows and many times most markings disappear.    Here is a pic of my own plus some from the internet. Notice in the one picture there is a pike and a young muskie together and how they contrast in colour.  Please back up your rebuttal with examples and pictures of these wonderful creatures. Please note that I am only making this fuss because I am bored due to the weather is too crappy to dewinterize my boat for the coming softwater season.     "
326257,BillM,2009-04-04 17:36:00,17367,Small immature pike have vertical banding like a muskie does.   I know a wackload of the ones we pull out of the French River do anyhow.
326265,Ron,2009-04-04 17:59:00,1683,"I first thought Pike as well but once you look at the other markings, I went back to agree with Limeyangler(sp). After all, he is the one that caught the fish in question. Not knowing the actual length of the fish other than judging by the size of the jig head, I would say a small pike. Look at the tail, soft, rounded. There are horizontal white patches on it similar to a Pike as well. Below is a Pike I caught in the Timmins area. Definately a Pike because there are no Muskie in the lake I caught this one in. It also has the vertical bars similar to a muskie. I would be more apt to believe juvenilles have this similar striation to help camouflage in the weeds.   "
326268,Ron,2009-04-04 18:12:00,1683,"Further looking at the Pike, you can count the sub mandibular pores and if I'm not mistaken there are 5 on it's left side. Take a very close look at the scaling on it's cheek and you will be able to see that the lower portion of the cheek is also covered with scales making me believe this is indeed a nice fish!"
326297,trapshooter,2009-04-04 20:04:00,1234,"I'm not sure how you can see scales or sub mandibular pores in that picture  Like you said skud, Muskie are light in colour with dark strips, bars and spots.  Limey's small essox has a dark body with light markings.  IMO, it's a pike."
326302,Guest gbfisher,2009-04-04 20:22:00,0,Pike......
326304,Joey,2009-04-04 20:25:00,9122,"Well, I honestly think its an Esox"
326306,Roy,2009-04-04 20:27:00,13728,"Here we go, esox guys trying to get into the salmonoid dudes' schtick. It's a pike guys, get over it."
326311,4thgen,2009-04-04 20:39:00,157,I've caught enough small pike to recognize that as one. It just looks pale due to the water clarity. I suspect that limeyangler has caught enough pike to be a pretty good judge as well.
326339,outllaw,2009-04-04 22:17:00,1232,"i see batter, and fries and salad mmm."
326401,cram,2009-04-05 01:26:00,1733,juvenile pike.   They look different when young......just google juvenile pike in google images.
326402,irishfield,2009-04-05 01:27:00,26272,   PIKE...
326409,Leecher,2009-04-05 01:50:00,7832,Essox.... when he saw Limey he just got scared and turned pale LOL  Pike not doubt about it
326412,waterwolf,2009-04-05 02:01:00,556,PIKER!!
326416,dave524,2009-04-05 02:10:00,4508,this thread reminded me of a video i saw on Utube but it wasn't just a limey angler it was in England . Same Muskie / Pike controversy  
326426,Cudz,2009-04-05 02:20:00,2652,Pretty sure it is an Atlantic.
326429,Leecher,2009-04-05 02:25:00,7832, No no no no..... it's a brown
326430,Cudz,2009-04-05 02:27:00,2652,"Oh, here we go."
326443,Skud,2009-04-05 02:56:00,739,"OK, I will bend to the masses and go with pike. Thanks for the replies and kudos to Ron for posting pics with his rebuttal."
326447,Ron,2009-04-05 03:10:00,1683,"  Ben..... You didn't see the smile face at the end of my post????  :D  Cheers man   Thanks Skud, bout time you admitted you were wrong once in your life. ha ha ha  Cheers, Ron...."
326480,limeyangler,2009-04-05 05:51:00,5204,its a pike.  water clarity of wabigoon makes 'em light as ben said  juveniles are stripy  and i have caught plenty of Wabigoon pike......and this is one of them!
326483,trapshooter,2009-04-05 07:48:00,1234,"  No harm, no fowl.  I respect your opinion Ron.  Cheers,  Ben"
326505,Spiel,2009-04-05 12:26:00,9065,Is it to late to offer an opinion on this?
326573,Skud,2009-04-05 16:00:00,739,"Yes, too late........I already converted."
326595,Raf,2009-04-05 17:12:00,3495,Em
