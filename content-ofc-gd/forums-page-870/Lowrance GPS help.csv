Pins are clean and clear on the back of fishfinder and haven't changed any electrical, any ideas?"
326825,irishfield,2009-04-06 01:35:00,26272,Mine plays the odd game with me. Darn certain there is a tee or end resistor with pin contact issues. Is yours built in antenna or external puck? Spray can of contact cleaner to every cable connection might fix you up if external puck.
326831,darsky,2009-04-06 01:38:00,586,I turned on my handheld for icefishing in March and it took almost an hour to catch .
326832,irishfield,2009-04-06 01:40:00,26272,Yep.. as Darsky states may just be an initialization issue. My airplane GPS takes from here at home to about the french river (50 minutes)... the first flight in the spring if I haven't flown all winter.  Turn the power on in the laneway and let it sit with a clear view of the sky.
