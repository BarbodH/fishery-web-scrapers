326936,crappieperchhunter,2009-04-06 12:22:00,2582,"Years ago I taste tested Rock bass, perch and crappie at the same time. Of those 3...Perch was my fav then rockies, then crappie. From cold spring water or through the ice they are great. Warmer water fish seem to have a stronger taste, so in the summer and fall I release them, or use them in fish chowder. They are no more boney then any other panfish, but there skin/scales are a lot harder to get through...so make sure you have a good knife or it can be frustrating."
326993,Hooked,2009-04-06 15:04:00,891,"I would have to say they are probably my favourite freshwater fish to eat, nice sweet taste to them.  If you have trouble cleaning them, then you're keeping the small ones, the bigger ones are no problem to clean at all."
327001,Zebco,2009-04-06 15:36:00,123,"I used to like em till I ate one up on Nip last summer.  I cleaned it with the eyes and pike and it was mushy and muddy tasting, so I don't think I'll keep anymore in the summer."
327007,Jet,2009-04-06 15:44:00,364,"I keep them and find them no different from other panfish in taste and ease of fillet, as others have already mentioned.  The other reason I keep them is to help the bass and other popular game fish. Anyone who has caught Rock Bass will know they are extremely aggressive, often hitting baits hanging right off the side of the boat or dock while fixing your line.  Rock Bass feed heavily on small fry, such as baby pass, walleye ect.. My friend has a cottage in a back lake with very little fishing pressure and it is filled with Rock Bass. So we do our part by eating a few!"
327012,smokin joe,2009-04-06 15:50:00,226,I'm willing to bet that Bigugli has a sure fire recepie to for rockbass.  I've been to a few of his fishfries and I can honestly say that he can make just about any fish taste good.  And when you put him and JWL in the kitchen watch out!!!!!
327148,douG,2009-04-06 20:50:00,2693,Thank you Garry 2Rs.

326618,Joeytier,2009-04-05 18:11:00,3990,"I regularly fish lakes with abundant supply of rock bass (to say the least), and instead of keeping walleye or bass for fish fries, I was considering having a rock bass fry.  Has anyone here tried them, and do they taste like bluegills, pumpkinseed etc? thanks"
326620,BillM,2009-04-05 18:15:00,17367,Good luck with the bones
326622,EC1,2009-04-05 18:16:00,930,I think they're as good as bluegills and sunfish for sure! Usually you'll have to take the bigger ones so that it's not too much of a hassle to clean..
326624,Fishnwire,2009-04-05 18:23:00,983,"If you don't mind cleaning a lot of fish for a little bit of meat...they taste fine.  Try keeping and cleaning a few before you commit to a bucket-full.  You may find they're more hassle then they're worth.  Like I say, if your patient, and good with a fillet knife (and sharpener) then go for it."
326625,Photoz,2009-04-05 18:26:00,792,"Perch are VERY tasty . . .   crappie are better . . .   bluegills & pumpkin seeds are good too . . .    even carp, cooked properly are somewhat similar to bass . . .   IF I caught big enough rock bass, I'd sure like to try it. They live in the same water as the aforementioned fish . . .     eat the same food . . ..   ??"
326636,Joeytier,2009-04-05 18:40:00,3990,"Thanks for the tips.  Typically, they aren't as big as crappie or bluegills, so I'd have to selective about which fish to keep.  I think I might invest in an electric fillet knife."
326637,misfish,2009-04-05 18:40:00,29133,"Back when,we ate rock bass, sunfish and what ever else we caught during our camping trips.Pop could fillet a minna with no bones. What I am saying is,it,s all good. If yer good with a knife,you got no worries about bones.     WHAT???????????????   Hi ya Steve, hope alls well bud."
326651,Greencoachdog,2009-04-05 19:14:00,8163,It's good white meat and they'll fry up nicely!!!
326653,Ramble,2009-04-05 19:18:00,713,No more difficult then any other pan fish to fillet. Depends on your skill level with a knife. I Keep a couple every winter ice fishing if then show up and are a descent size. No complaints about the meat taste. Just a bluegill or a 'seed.  -Dave
