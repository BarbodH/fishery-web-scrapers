326354,pigeonfisher,2009-04-04 23:32:00,696,"Hey fella,  So I am at the gym this morning with a conundrum.  I had no socks.  So I says to myself. Self, you need to be able to swim a 1/2 mile by september.  Why not start working on it today.  Ok I says to me.  I spent half my time in the pool pulling my shorts up...hahhaha. Went out and purchased a bathing suit...Size Large!  I qualified for my health premium on Friday by weighing in at 221 lbs.  Next week I start weight training as I have six weeks consecutive at home.  I am in an ""Adventure Race"" at one of the local state parks in September.  1/2 mile swim, 3 mile run, 10 mile bike.  I believe that my goal times are 30-33 minutes on the run, 30-34 minutes on the bike and I have no idea on the swim yet.   How are you doing?  Still staying strong?  Anyone else having a succesful year getting healthy?"
326358,Joey,2009-04-04 23:48:00,9122,"That's Great Steve, I'm proud of you.  I started my own weight loss/get fit regime about two weeks ago.  I started walking, then jogging (well half jogging half walking) and watching what I eat.  I'm down 5 lbs so far and went and bought myself a ""good"" pair of jogging shoes yesterday.  I'm hoping to lose about 15 more lbs, but want to tone also so have incorporated a bit of Yoga and some small weights to start.  Joey"
326364,pigeonfisher,2009-04-04 23:58:00,696,"Hey Joey,  I was doing the Jogging program and my knee gave me some problems so I have shelved it for a while.  If I am still at this in June then I get a good pair of running shoes.  We have a couple of great running shops around.  I have been doing a lot of walking cycles on the treadmill.  I do a lot of incline walking.  Recently started my bike work and becoming a lot stronger there as well.  My go to has been the Eliptical.  We have a couple different ones at my YMCA and they each seem to give me a different work out.  My biggest surprise during all of this is how quickly my fitness level improved and continues to improve.  I really like it.  Good for you, Joey.  Are you still done with the darts (smokes)?"
326395,Joey,2009-04-05 01:07:00,9122,"I was never done with the darts Steve, only the drink.  I'd like to quit.  Maybe I'll lose an extra 10 and then quit.  You know how quitting makes you gain  I've also noticed the fitness level progress quickly, alot quicker than I thought.  I hate gyms tho so I'm going to try the outdoor thing all summer.  I also have an exercise bike for rainy days, and I bought some aerobic dvd's today just in case.  Joey"
