326642,scuro2,2009-04-05 18:57:00,904,"Thinking of taking the Chi-Cheemaun. Anyone take this ferry regularly, and if so how close to departure can you arrive and usually get on?"
326645,irishfield,2009-04-05 19:01:00,26272,At some times of year I believe you even need a reservation.  Call them or check their FAQ..  http://www.ontarioferries.com/chi/english/index.html
326648,scuro2,2009-04-05 19:08:00,904,"Sure, long weekends make a reservation...but midweek or non-summer or holiday weekends...how late can you typically arrive."
326650,fishforfun,2009-04-05 19:12:00,105,"Be there 45mins to an hr in advance, park your car in the line up and go for a walk. Tobermory is a nice little town."
326661,danbouck,2009-04-05 19:46:00,4380,"Like fishforfun says, be there 45min to 1 hr early. Got there 45 minutes early once and had to wait about 4 hours for the next trip. I was the cut off point."
326664,jediangler,2009-04-05 19:53:00,1923,"One of the best parts of touring on a motorcycle is you can arrive last, and be the first one on a ferry. Also when you arrive, you're the first one to drive off, ahead of all the camper traffic. Nothing worse than following someone towing a tent trailer on twisty northern roads."
326665,misfish,2009-04-05 19:56:00,29133,"Go east.  Sorry cant help ya on yer post,but this is ,the best price.  http://www.tw.gov.nl.ca/FerryServices/schedules/A-bipc.stm"
326678,fishforfun,2009-04-05 20:34:00,105,Misfish did the Bell Island ferry several years ago. Pulled into the line around 8am the guys in the car in front of us got out walked back to the trunk and started into the beers LOL Apparently returning home for a wedding great guys and a down right friendly community!
326686,misfish,2009-04-05 21:00:00,29133, There ya go.
326706,JohnF,2009-04-05 21:54:00,3494,"When in doubt, reserve. It can be very busy. If you don't book ahead get there at least (!!!!!) an hour before departure and keep yer fingers crossed. Walk-ons are usually no problem (as long as you have a ride on the other side).  JF"
326789,BUSTER,2009-04-06 00:51:00,1336,"it was 70 bucks for 2 guys in a car...we just showed up , took a chance and it was full but they have an overload area to park and see if they can sqeeze you in, and we got shoved in the back, well it was a honda crv not very big, but we just fit and a couple other cars too, usually they have room for 4-5 more cars', and sometimes reservations dont show, but DONT rely on it.  sooo true for the bikers, thats a ride i want to take on the bike.   first on first off the boat,nice tour that would be."
