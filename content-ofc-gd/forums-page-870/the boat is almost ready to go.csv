326777,brifishrgy,2009-04-06 00:28:00,559,I picked up a new minkota bowmount a little while back .. finely had some decent weather to get moving on installing it .. the old fiberglass deck had to come off due to the fact that the motor needs a flat surface to mount to ... after peeling off the fiberglass I found aluminum plate under it which I tore out too      made up a new deck for the front and extended the existing deck    installed the  motor to the front      just have to install the carpet on the casting deck and reinstall the doors and it should be good to go .. with any luck the weather this week will cooperate and I get out to Dunnville for some cats next weekend
