326201,bushart,2009-04-04 15:33:00,2628,A while ago I watched a program on the earliest artwork known to mankind--which was the ones found in the caves in France.  Anyway they were done suprisingly well and after much research & debate they appear to depict:  The animals they hunted & Dying  Anyway not wishing to be outdone by our mastadonian cloaked ancestory--I came up this...  People I sent this to I mentioned---If I'm goin--I'm takin my fishin rod..so...I put in my 1st rod (circa 40 plus years ago accompanied with that old Johnson Skipper reel-also same era) __This is why I threw this on this side and not the foto.

327029,ehg,2009-04-06 16:18:00,2666,Great painting! You really have a definite painting style. Agree with the 'Stairway to Heaven' theme. Would be nice to see that brook trout painting in your avatar in large size.
