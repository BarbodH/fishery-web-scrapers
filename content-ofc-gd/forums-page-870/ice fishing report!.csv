326794,xeon,2009-04-06 01:04:00,350,"They usually go shallow to feed on eggs of walleye, pike, and suckers in the spring. Really the only time they are guarenteed to be deep (for the most part) is during the summer.  Their ways are really still a mystery for me, I don't understand them at all, and they can be quite a challange to catch sometimes."
326841,Beans,2009-04-06 01:47:00,3339,"Back in my younger days (forty years ago) we used to jig for whitefish with a williams wabler tipped with a minnow on a drop line in about 5 feet of water below the ice...  We would lie face down with a jacket or tarp over our heads and peer down at the bottom...the trick was, when the fish appeared, you watched your minnow not the fish...when your minnow disappeared, you lifted up...Fun Times !!!"

326869,pike slayer,2009-04-06 02:36:00,1177,"ya thats what we were doing! we were on the ice watching them, we didnt bait the hooks though! and we caught a few pike this way to. and dara you dont have to go alllll the way to basswood to lay into some 5lbers! theres places in your backyard where you can get them!"
326896,trapshooter,2009-04-06 03:30:00,1234,We got one out of 10' yesterday.  Same thing happens in the spring up here while jigging walleye in late May / early June.  Has to do with water temperature too.
326901,xeon,2009-04-06 04:11:00,350," Marks or Leighs bay... well, ice is a bit sketchy on that part of superior right now, the picture is from 2 weekends ago, and that orange thing is a tip up. The pressure crack ran all the way from the steel plant to Marks Bay (across from airport). "
