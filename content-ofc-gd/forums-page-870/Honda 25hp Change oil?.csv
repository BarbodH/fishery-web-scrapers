325785,Mr Twister,2009-04-03 14:51:00,71,I picked up a 25hp tiller style Honda and would like to know if oil of choice would be synthetic or mineral 10W30 ? Is the oil drain plug the one in the rear of the shaft?  Any help would be great and thank's!

325987,Fisherman,2009-04-03 23:24:00,7201,"I don't think it covers the 25HP + sizes of Honda, only goes up to the 20's."
326014,tschirk,2009-04-04 00:33:00,261,go syn Honda's deserve it!
326016,irishfield,2009-04-04 00:42:00,26272,"Maybe.. but not what's recommended in the manual. Plain old 10W30 for my, 2002 25 HP, Honda and an oil filter.  I won't use full synthetic in anything."
326077,Maverick,2009-04-04 04:02:00,371, Covers 2-130HP years 1976-2005 and goes over how to do an oil change and what to put in it in the Maintenance section.

326726,tschirk,2009-04-05 22:57:00,261, Wayne:  Can you elaborate? I thought Syn was better for the engine? Ted
326736,irishfield,2009-04-05 23:19:00,26272,"Personally I think full synthetics are just hype Ted... and lighten your wallet accordingly. My, hot running (222F oil) supercharged, Verada specifically states you are NOT to use full synthetic but a blend of petro base and synthetic. The 4 stroke Honda or most others need nothing but the engine oil you put in your old car. From the manual  The viscosity index (weight) indicates the flow rate of the oil. For most models Honda recommends a 10W-30 or 10W-40 viscosity oil that meets API service classification SG, SH or SJ. This weight and grade of oil is suitable under most operating conditions."
326742,Mike the Pike,2009-04-05 23:28:00,3421,I looked into last fall for my 50 Honda my dealer said that was a no no.Did not say why.  So I just stuck to the regular oil.
