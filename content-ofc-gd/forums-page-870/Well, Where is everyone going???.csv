326946,TJQ,2009-04-06 12:48:00,7806,"Ahhh!!!  Camp Jiggy Jiggy for me for as much of the summer as the family will allow.. (I knew I shouldn't have put that darn pool in...  Gonna put a screened in section on the big tent this spring, so I don't fall asleep in the bugs again... LOL      "
326947,TJQ,2009-04-06 12:50:00,7806, LOL.. You'll have to make reservations.. but theres always beer in the fridge!!  Mayhaps we shall coordinate the next visit a bit better!!  Ive got some frinds coming up from NY in august... Ill get ya to come in.. that'll freak 'em out!
326979,Zubris21,2009-04-06 14:06:00,563,"Well, I wouldn't consider it summer, but I'm heading up to the Liard Hotsprings this weekend, and will hopefully get some hardwater action in.  Still want to get up to another little lake about 4 hours North, just past the Yukon border before the ice melts it was stocked with Arctic Char in the past.  I don't think there is much size (top out around 6lbs from what I've heard), but would like to add to the species list.  May long weekend I'm planning on heading down to Terrace to fish the legendary Skeena, Kalum and Copper rivers for Steelhead, and maybe Chinooks if they're running.  Also once the snow melts, I'll be doing numerous overnight trips along the Dease River, chasing giant Northerns, and some Grayling for the pan.  End of June I will be heading back to Ontario for a solid 2 months of nothing but time to waste.  The plan is to get as much fishing in as possible, and with anyluck hook up with some other members from the Belleville, Kingston, Brockville, Ottawa area for some outings."
327009,tinbanger,2009-04-06 15:48:00,1028,Ok I'll play along now  Our big trip will be LOW this summer to see how Pikeie is handleing all that fishing  Not sure when but most likely August .  TB
327160,misfish,2009-04-06 21:06:00,29133," August sounds good Dave.Bags are packed.  One of the big wigs at the plant, bought a cottage and is offering up weeks and weekend trips for the employees for a low cost. Need to do some research on the lake ."

305997,tdotfisherman,2009-02-13 17:02:00,317,"Probably head up to Georgian Bay about 4 or 5 times this summer.. Nippising area probably 2 or 3 times.. Maybe hit Simcoe or Scugog.. definately Lake Ontario, both from shore, and from a boat.. I'm going to B.C. but we'll see if we can get some fishing in or not.. Charter fishing packages for Salmon/Halibut are extremely expensive.. I'd rather save the $600-800 bucks and buy myself a nice Lowrance GPS/Sonar unit instead.."
306013,Ramble,2009-02-13 18:37:00,713,Week into Algonquin in May. 2 months at the lodge and another week in Algonquin in August. In between i'm going to have to arrange some other adventures.  -Dave

Then it's back to gullrock and red lake.  Hopefully my fishing partner in the Red Lake Fall Classic will enter us into a tournament at Lake of the Prairies this year for a change of scenery and maybe a change of luck.  Now I just have to wait for the 3 feet of ice to melt."

And every year including this year Iâ€™ll probably be walking the shore of Lake Scugog more than a few times in search for more bass! Last year i think the count was about 85 days i was out and fishing, I'm not sure if i'll be able to get out that many times this year but i hope to get out at least 50 times . Good luck this year everybody!"

Lots of other fish'n trips will also take place, but they'll be spur of the moments decisions.  Life is good !!"
