326696,FisherMike,2009-04-05 21:26:00,108,"the only other place in or around london is archies.  im pretty sure its called archies anyway, it around hamilton rd and adelaide.  however, the place is extremely unreliable.  the guy opens and closes at completely random times.  i stopped going there years ago, but last  time i was there he did sell minnows.  definitely call ahead."
326766,bow slayer,2009-04-06 00:04:00,1074,I don't think Archie is there anymore. It was called stop and Go bait. I think he has started to run it out of house again over off Thompson Road area. I can't remember the street name but I know where it is.
326770,scugpg,2009-04-06 00:13:00,1373," Archie's (519) 432-0880 - 152 Emerson Avenue, London  He's still there."
