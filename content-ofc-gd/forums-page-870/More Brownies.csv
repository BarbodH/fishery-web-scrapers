324108,CLofchik,2009-03-30 20:09:00,854," Only the province has been withholding budget funds at a higher exchange rate than what the Special Purpose Fund adds.  For every fishing license dollar that adds to the MNR fish & wildlife budget, the province has withdrawn around $1.38 of provincial funding.  So from a high (adjusted for inflation) of around $100Mil in 1992, funded without license fees, the fish & wildlife budget is now around $72mil.  $60Mil from the Special Purpose Fund, $12Mil from the province.  Saying ""every dollar from fishing & hunting licenses goes back into the MNR"" is paper pushing semantics when you simply take more money away from other areas.   How many hundreds of thousands of smolts have been stocked every year for the last two decades with NOTHING to show for it?  So now we've gone to yearlings, and again we have to wait & see.  When can we as anglers finally say the entire Atlantic program is nothing but smoke & mirrors that only exists because of various agendas driving it?"
326476,john from craa,2009-04-05 05:04:00,39,"Wow!  If half this energy was put forth to rehab streams, plant trees, lift fish and protect our rivers we might have more fish to catch and be too busy fishing and not spend our time typing away on chat boards.  8 pages!  Like Louis, I have to jump in.  Craig - good to see you keeping busy.  You should drop by and see some chromers on the Credit - they are sweet.  Every night at 5 pm if Mother Nature keeps it warm.  Beer in the fridge (don't tell Louis).  I am also one of those back in the day steelheaders, and have caught steel all over the Great Lakes, West Coast and salar on various Great Lakes and East Coast.  However I support Atlantic salmon.  For the record, there were 49 grilse lifted and confirmed at Streetsvile (pretty close to 50).  34 were transported to the headwaters.  There were reports of a few larger fish, plus other grilse from the lower river not included in the 49.  Not a lot, but a good start.  Atlantic stocking numbers rhetoric:  The vast majority of the one million Atlantic's stocked thus far were stocked as fry (about 750,000).  About 200,000 fingerlings and only 60,000 yearlings.  Why is this important?  1 smolt equals about 20 fingerlings and 100 fry.  So in reality at a yearling (smolt) equivelent only 77,500 +/- have been stocked, divided by 3 years equals 25,000 per year.  The partnerships production for more fish is just kicking into high gear in 2009.  Some comparables:  MNR stocked roughly 60,000 to 120,000 coho yearlings annualy to produce a run of 1000-1500 adults in the Credit in recent years. MNR stocks an average 25,000 yearling steelhead to the Credit each year - return is roughly 600-1,000 fish per year (this has five year classes making up the total or 120 to 200 fish from each years stocking). MNR stocks an annual average of 150,000 brown trout yearlings each year (6 times Atlantic stocking rate) - Only 12 fin clipped brown trout returned to the Streetsville fishway last year.  How many clipped browns did you catch from the 150 k. Credit was stocked with roughly 25,000 Atlantic yearling equivelents (2005 year class) to produce a return of 50 grilse.  You cannot compare stocking one million Atlantics (750,000 as fry) to 200,000 yearling steelhead or 150,000 yearling browns.  It is an apples to oranges comparison.  Pennsylvania stocks between 600,000 and 1.2 million steelhead smolts every year to create their cookie cutter steelhead fishery.  NY stocks 50-100 K into one Erie trib alone to make a run - but much of the run is made up from Penn strays.  Atlantic stocking is funded outside the MNR, not with tax dollars, but with third party money - so no loss to MNR's budget.  Yet some of those dollars and support are helping all the other salmonids.  As Louis stated, the Norval fishway is within our grasp and salar is key to helping speed the process up.  That ladder will be a shot in the arm for wild steelhead and browns too!  Quanlity vs. quantity - is stocking the answer?  The last time I fished Pennsylvania was November 1994.  I had 50 hot chromers in the first pool of the creek, all between 6-8 pounds.  3 pound tippet (pre dates florocarbon), longest fight - 60 seconds, longest run - 20 feet.  I left the river and swore never to return to fish for lazy, weak cookie cutters.  I have not been back since.  I did enjoy the late run on the NY trib Craig and I shared several times in the late 90's as they had some muscle, but I would gladly take 5 Credit or Notty chromers over 50 of those fish.  The other day I had a 5 pound buck in the Credit jump 8 times and take me down the river 300 feet - and I had 8.8 pound tippet on.  Or the 15 pound buck the day before that kicked my ass for 10 minutes.  Or the hot chromer a buddy had last week that walked him 400 yards down and kissed him goodbye.  Some of our big rivers are blessed with strong fish, but over harvest and lack of access to spawning grounds are the hurdles to good fishing.  Steelhead Genetic divergence?  Most wild Great Lakes Steelhead have divereged.  Wild Credit steelhead are genetically different than the stockers and they have only had 20-30 years to change.  Notty and Bighead steelies are also divergent down to the tributary according to genetic studies done.  North shore Superior steelhead - divergent.  I do totally agree with Craig that even MNR's stocking should be done from wild returns, not 4th generation brood stock, but I feel managing our wild fish to prevent over harvest is more important.  The Coaster  Since I am the guy who took the pic posted here - my 2 cents.  I did ask the brookie where it came from, but it just looked at me like I was an alien - not sure why?  The brookie was in the top end of the Streetsville fishway with a pack of big chinooks. It had to jump over 5 - 12-18"" jumps going upstream to get where it was caught.  It did not pass down, unless it squeezed through the 1"" square steel screen.  So, could it be a resident that dropped down and went back up - highly unlikely - it was the middle of September.  Temperatures two weeks prior in the river had been above the lethal level for brookies far above the ladder.  It is also not the first one ever reported in the Credit and many have been reported lake wide.  In 20 years of MNR and CVC shocking no brookie even close to that size has been caught in the upper Credit.  My bet - lake run - only way to get that big and be where he was.  And finally - the first pic - The picture quality is not clear enough to say 100%.  My bet - it was a brown, but 10% of me says Atlantic too.  The tail is slightly forked, the caudle peduncle is thin, the dorsal is sloped more and the head is more pointed, but the maxillary passes the eye and the base of the tail starts like a brown.  Nonetheless, it is a tough call.  We had a brown at the Streetsville fishway that was also a very difficult call.  When asked if he was a brown or Atlantic the fish replied ""certainly not sir, I'm a tarpon""  Have fun and give a little back to your favourite fishery.  With only 12 million dollars for MNR funding through tax dollars the MNR staff need our help!  John President of CRAA"
326481,Zubris21,2009-04-05 06:00:00,563," Interesting you should note this....  Out here in BC the licensing is completely different.  Standard non-tidal fishing license cost $36, however this does not give you the privileged of fishing steelhead, for that you must also purchase a species tag for I believe an additional $25.  Even with this additional species tag, you are still not permitted to fish all waters, the most productive waters are considered ""classified waters"" and are most important to the survival of the species and fisheries.  In order to fish these waters you must purchase a classified waters license for an additional cost (again in the $20-25 range).  Even with these licenses you are only allowed to retain 10 hatchery steelhead/year, all wild fish must be released.  Sturgeon also works the same way, but I am less familiar with them as they are only found much farther south than I am.  As for salmon your standard non-tidal license gives you permission to fish for them, however if you intend to keep any of your catch you must purchase a salmon tag for an additional $15,  and even with this the regs dictate quota's for the rivers.  Of the runs in our local river which include sockeye, pink, coho, chum, and chinook, I only have the priviledge to keep a couple adult chinnys.  All total my license this year cost me $80, $36 for the standard, $25 for the steelies, and $15 for the salmon.  Likely I will need to purchase classified waters as well, as I think I will head down to the Skeena/Kalum rivers to try for some world class steelies in may.  TO be honest, I didn't have any problem paying this as I know the money is spent well.  I have been working fairly closely with our local fisheries person, as I have set up a Sockeye raising project for one of my classes.  I will post pictures at some point for everyone to see."
326501,siwash,2009-04-05 12:03:00,683,"  ""cleaning up the lake"" is gonna require a lot more money tha they throw at this atlantic program...   i'm also on the fence... lots of people have bashed the re-introduction attempt but I've heard that atlantics are amazing fighters... let me re-phrase that... i know they are from a some limited experience. A few yrs ago I was fishing in my favourite creek targeting specks and  browns. It's a river that has received alot of the atlantics over the years. Well, on this day I ended up hooking and mostly landing at least 15 to 20 atlantics... small but incredibly fiesty.. fought like 3 lb fish but they were only 9-11 inchs long. They were silver bullets, jumping clear out of the water... just a blast to catch and a lot mre fun than catching the brookies nd browns, quite frankly.. it was a memorable day and regrettably i haven no pics to prove this! But anyone who's familiar with the stocking program proably has an idea as to where I was fishing.. I did catch a few more the following year, ut I haven't returned to the spot the past two yrs..will be back this year for sure, with a camera  all were released.. i wonder how many survived and made it to the lake...?"
326521,River Rat,2009-04-05 13:43:00,161,"you can dump all the smolts in the breakwalls you want....Johns numbers are proof that it doesn't work. Penn raising is the best way to imprint and have a higher rate of return. The charter boys out east lake O are taking matters into thier own hands. The MNR stocks 25,000 chinnies off the bowmanville harbour boat launch every year. This year they have approval to take 5,000 of these smolts and leave em in a penn that they guys got together to fund and build. If the motality rate stays low, next year they are penning 10,000.  It has been proven up and down the north shore of lake O that penn raising works. The penns for Port Darlington cost $800 each to build. The return numbers of the 5,000 fish will be monitored of course but the return rate is stagering as compared to breakwall dumping. The fish survival rate, size on return and over all quality is also un matched by any ""dump smolt"" efforts we have seen so far.  The problem: we need more dedicated volenteers. These penns have to be monitored daily for water temp and disolved oxygen levels. Automatic feeders need to be filled and serviced daily and morts removed and logged daily.  I'm not a huge fan of the chinnies. In my perfect world we would be hooking wild bows, Altlantics and browns all day long like we did back in the 80""s (bows n browns anyway) but it ain't gonna happen without tons of volenteers with strategic plans regarding stream re-had, and penn rearing. The charter boys need the chinn dogs to make a living. That is why they have gotten of thier ass'es and done something to protect thier fishery. That's why I have volenteered to help out....I know that this project will work because the people running it have something to lose.  I get my Atlantics fix a couple times a year and I travel very far to get it. It would be great to see them in my local water but without the volenteer groups and penn raising, I just can't see it happening.  I'll leave you with a fact that may help us all see the bigger problem: three years ago, stout fellow.NET group got together with the CLOCA people and organized and Oshawa creek clean up......we dragged out 32 shopping carts and litterally TONS of debris from hypdermic needles to fire extinguishers, bikes...bags, timmies cupps, water bottles...you name it..........the next year we cleaned out 27 new shopping carts from the same stretch of river and whatever else we could find.....we skipped a season so I can'timagine what she will look like this year.  We have more problems than just stocking isues and return rates.  RR"
326557,siwash,2009-04-05 15:19:00,683,"   Interesting.. so ha this been proven scientifically or is it anecdotal? BTW, why don't you think the chinny is worth stocking? What makes browns that much more appealing? they certainly don't fight as well as a king... And if my memory serves me correctly, the Chinny was king in the 80s! size and numbers were outstanding and 40+ were caught annually. It was a true trophy fishery back then.., just my humble opinion!"
326569,wallacio,2009-04-05 15:49:00,475,"  RR it should be noted that parr/smolt survival from Atlantic plants in the Credit has been quite encouraging over the years.    Fish are planted high in the nursery headwater area ie Forks of the Credit and based on counts, they are doing just fine.    As someone who fishes up there all summer, I can personally attest to this fact as we catch little Atlantics all of the time while targetting Browns.  I'm glad to see some factual information posted by experts who have direct working knowledge with the program (ie John from CRAA) rather than just the typical bashing from the nay-sayers whose opinions are usually lacking in factual information.    I'm cautiously optimistic about this program and hope that it is successful...if not, at the very least our local watersheds and naturalized salmonid populations will be better for it from all of the rehab work associated with the project."
326592,ehg,2009-04-05 17:06:00,2666,"Way back in the mid - 1980's i remember hitting into smolt Atlantics, not intentionally,while fishing bows in Wilmot. Others were catching them as well. Was thinking that would lead to higher mortality from stresses of angling. Still hitting Atlantics on tribs when brookie fishing headwaters. This has to be not good for them.    Maybe pen raising would help avoid some of this and bring more success to Atlantic re-introduction.  "
326596,BillM,2009-04-05 17:15:00,17367,"Erik, that looks like a rainbow smolt to me...  Very similar to the ones I've caught while brookie fishing in the Notty headwaters.  "

326605,BillM,2009-04-05 17:38:00,17367,"No offense at all man, now I know what to look out for"
326673,aniceguy,2009-04-05 20:22:00,1094,"Well,  Penn raising should only be an option with the chinooks in streams where access to rearing habitat is not an option such as an existing barrier, Port Dalhousie is an example, but with a viable fish ladder at Bowmanville IMO pen rearing shouldnt be done there and where stocked the practice of stocking and the specific location as laid out by LOMU should be re examined.  Any fish if pen reared is going to have a marked increase in its survivability.  Remember thy Life History of a chinook differs from all other cold water fish, by spring of the following year they are gone back to the lake.  There are a few off the radar creeks on the N shore of Lake Ontario that do in fact recieve a run of a migratory brook trout.  All of these fish are plactic in thier nature some more then others and as such will migrate out of a river environmentto a lake."
326729,BassAsin,2009-04-05 23:11:00,806,"here in north  bay we have a lake with you name it in there (large and smallmouth, pike,perch,walleye,suckers,smelt,specks,rainbows,lakers, musky,sturgeon sunfish rock bass and atlantics.)  i'm sure i missed a few in there too but none the less the atlantics are now doing very well. what was once considered a ""waste"" of money is now a great fishery once their spawning grounds were cleaned/corrected for them, they reproduce naturally now and are caught by many anglers downrigging while the season is open for a week in the summer. once considered a waste of time is now a great success which is putting back to the lake. as for spending the money on rainbows or coho's instead i dont think theres a need for that, judging by the posts on this site there are ample bows in the great lakes anyway,    Nice report, them are some good lookin fish browns atlantics whatever they may be good work. looks like you have no motor on the boat from them pictures!  Matt!"
326915,CLofchik,2009-04-06 07:39:00,854,   The easiest way to tell a parr Atlantic from everything else is their head. See how large the eye is compared to the size of fish and small mouth with a jaw that doesn't close past the eye.  Atlantic.
322746,craigdritchie,2009-03-27 13:40:00,1586,"TDunn  MNR began stocking Atlantic salmon in the Credit River and Wilmot Creek in the mid-1980s, and the results were absolutely dismal. A handful of adults did show up in the Credit river, far fewer in Wilmot. By the early 1990s MNR knew they had a problem, so they shifted focus and tried to understand why the results were so poor. That research phase started in about 1992 or 1993. They tried stocking Atlantics in a number of locations and from a variety of sources, including both sea-run and landlocked strains.  After 10 years of this, they still had no results, and concluded that neither Lake Ontario nor its tributaries are suitable for Atlantic salmon reintroduction. In the lake, the fish suffer from thiamine deficiencies (as MJL noted in an earlier post) which lead to very low survival rates. In the streams, MNR concluded that Atlantics are unlikely to reproduce, as the juveniles simply cannot compete against juvenile rainbow trout, coho salmon or chinook salmon for either food or living space. They can spawn alright, but fry survival is the pits. MNR found that Atlantic salmon cannot adapt to the physical structure of most Lake Ontario tributaries, specifically the sandy/silty bottoms and sunken wood providing the primary form of cover. MNR said Atlantics need open streams with no silt and rocks or boulders as the primary form of cover - which was the way Lake Ontario tributaries might have been 300 years ago, but not today.  New York also had an Atlantic salmon program in the late 80s and early 90s. They poured hundreds of thousands of the things into the Salmon River and a few other streams, but the results were so disappointing they discontinued the program altogether after a few years.  The current Lake Ontario Atlantic salmon stocking program is a complete sham - it's partially funded by an Australian winery that uses it as a marketing ploy. No joke. And, sadly, still no results.  On a more positive note, MNR has stocked lake trout into Lake Ontario since the 1970s, and there are all kinds of them out there. Not sure if they're reproducing on their own or not ... if so, it's not in big numbers."
322747,tonyb,2009-03-27 13:45:00,1637,"Great info Craig, I would also add that I don't think the Lakers contribute as much to the overall fishing generated economy as much as Chinooks, Steelhead and Coho.  They do grow very large and are numerous, but they just aren't as popular a target."
322772,fish_finder,2009-03-27 15:10:00,370," I don't want to start anything here....but some of this information just doesn't add up.  I can say myself that I have alot of respect for that Australian winery.  I mean really, a donation of 1.25 million dollars to help restore a species half a world away is quite admirable...regardles of them using it as a marketing ploy.  The LCBO also tossed $200000 into the pot as well and continues to assist.....that I find a little upsetting as the LCBO can probably afford quite a bit more than that.  Tremendous work has been done to restore those streams that have seen stocking as well, and last year there were atlantics captured at fish ladders.  On top of that, one stream also saw a massive coaster brooktrout captured in the process as well.  Again, I'm not trying to stir the pot here, but the restoration of a native species here is something we should all be approaching with open minds and giving our assistance wherever we can."
322774,kemper,2009-03-27 15:17:00,2232," Marketing ploy or not, its great that they are sending money but we have to be realistic. We stocked a million Atlantics and what...37 came back? When do we cut our losses and start stocking species that we KNOW are going to thrive. I really wish that we could get the Atlantics back, but it just doesnt seem possible and its sucking up a whole lot of money that could be used elsewhere.  Im no pro on the subject, but it just doesnt seem to make sense to pour millions into a program that has a success rate that is so low?"
322860,fish_finder,2009-03-27 17:53:00,370," Thats a very good point Kemper, but how many millions of steelies, coho and chinook were and still are stocked in order to keep up with the fishing pressure here.  The fact that atlantics are now being found during their migration shows that something positive is occuring in our waterways!"

323850,Jon,2009-03-30 00:39:00,209,"Craig:  It's been a while since we've chatted.  The last time we spoke was when we walked the Humber to check out the fishways.  I hope things are well.  I will start by saying that I am a supporter of the Atlantic salmon program and have been involved over the last couple of years.  I am also a steelhead, chinook, bass, muskie, crappie and perch fisherman.  I am not expecting this post to convince people that don't support the Atlantic salmon program to buy in.  I just want to put some perspective on the numbers of fish stocked in Lake Ontario.  I did a quick search on the Great Lakes Fishery Commission website, which has a fish stocking database for the Great Lakes (GLFC stocking database).  The other information came from the Lake Ontario Management Unit Annual Report (Lake Ontario Management Unit).  I don't think their numbers are completely accurate or up to date, but they are the best numbers that I know of.  As of the writing of this post, the MNR page doesn't seem to be working.  The numbers show that in 2006, there were 644,650 rainbow trout stocked on the US side of Lake Ontario (GLFC database).  The 2006 LOMU Annual Report indicates that 251,545 rainbows were stocked in the Ontario waters of Lake Ontario.  The total is 896,195 or just 100,000 shy of 1 million.  The GLFC database also states that 1,826,900 Chinooks were stocked in 2006 on the US side, with an additional 406,806 stocked on the Ontario side.  A search of both web pages indicates that a total of 374,255 Atlantics were stocked in 2006 on both sides of the lake (345,455 in Ontario).  Last year's confirmed returns of Atlantics were just under 50 fish in the Credit, with a few others in Duffins and Cobourg.  All of these are believed to be the same year class (grilse).  It will be interesting to see how many return this year with a second year class to add to last year's returns.  How many 2 year old Chinooks would have returned from a 2006 stocking?  Probably pretty low numbers as well.  Chinook salmon typically return to spawn in their 4th year.  Therefore, fish returning in 2008 were largely a result of stocking in 2004.  In that year, a total of 2,384,761 Chinooks were stocked in Lake Ontario (GLFC database).  In the same year, 948,807 rainbows were stocked on both sides of the lake (GLFC database).  305,569 Altantics were stocked in Lake Ontaro in 2004, of which 35,865 were on the Canadian side.  While certainly low, there were reports of a few larger Atlantics in the Credit last fall.  According to the GLFC database, Atlantics were stocked starting in 1986, rainbows in 1975 and Chinooks in 1969.  Totals stocked over the years are 5,152,378 Atlantics, 26,453,636 rainbow trout, and 71,620,356 Chinooks.  By the way, the GLFC database reports that lake trout were first stocked in 1963, on top of an admittedly low population, and continues to this day, with more than 400,000 stocked in 2007.  I have no idea what the cost to raise these fish is but it is easily into the millions.  The runs of trout and salmon we see every year are made up of a number of year classes established over numerous years of stocking and wild production.  The numbers haven't been there for the Atlantics and time, not me, will obviously tell if the Atlantic salmon reintroduction program is a success.  While this assessment is by no means the be all and end all to this debate, I hope that it makes some people rethink this program.   Jon"
323855,aniceguy,2009-03-30 00:48:00,1094,trying to figure out who you are Jon Pm so we can chat Craig I ll buy you a few beers and explain exactly how the program is of benefit.  Come by the ladder and we can chat
323887,Sinker,2009-03-30 01:45:00,8692," I'm happy to see this thread has turned into an informative discussion.  Thanks, Sinker"
324024,craigdritchie,2009-03-30 15:19:00,1586,"Hi Jon,  Yes, it’s been a very long time indeed – several years and at least one wife ago! Things are awesome, thank you, and I hope they are for you too.  As your figures note, the State of New York stocks one heck of a lot of fish – which explains precisely why fishing on that side of the lake is so much more productive than it is here. I don’t know if you have ever had the pleasure of fishing in New York, but the numbers of fish are absolutely astounding. Compared to Ontario, it’s day and night, and that's why you see so many Ontario guys fishing in New York (and none of our American friends wasting their time up here). My only real beef is that a large proportion of the rainbows they stock come from hatchery brood stock – I would be happier if they were stripped from returning adults, but I appreciate the economics behind that decision.  As you note Jon, we stock approximately 250,000 steelhead on our side of Lake Ontario, and this (with help from natural reproduction) supports a sizable sport fishery. Yet in spite of the fact we stock even larger numbers of Atlantic salmon, we see very, very few of them survive. It is clear to anyone that steelhead survival is significantly greater – we all see steelhead and we all catch steelhead, as evidenced by repeated reports of someone going “8 for 12” on a given morning. When was the last time any of us went out and went 8 for 12 on Atlantic salmon? Apart from the CRAA guys working their fish ladder, have any of us even seen 12 Lake Ontario Atlantic salmon in our entire lifetime?  Not many people have, I assure you of that.  One has to question the value of any stocking program that produces such low returns that not even 50 individuals can be counted at a fishway. Why not put all this effort and money and hatchery capacity into managing steelhead, and provide tax-paying anglers with a fishery instead of a science experiment?"
324025,craigdritchie,2009-03-30 15:22:00,1586," Hiya Louis  I'm definitely up for the suds, but that will have to be after the school year finishes (went back to university to complete a marketing degree). I'm sure we can find a nice sunny patio."
324027,kemper,2009-03-30 15:24:00,2232,Just another point...  I personally would GLADLY pay an extra 40 or 50 bucks a year for a fishing license if it meant greater stocking in the great lakes of salmon and trout...and I wonder how many others would do that same?
324030,BillM,2009-03-30 15:35:00,17367," And you wonder why people travel to the US to catch steelhead..  Sure there is the whole quantity vs quality argument, but man.... It's fun to hook into 30 fish a day..  That would NEVER happen here with any type of frequency...  Some of the stories I've heard even make 30 fish days look like peanuts.."
324032,Guest gbfisher,2009-03-30 15:36:00,0,donations work .............  and not the same fight there Bill......so a 30 fish day would kill anything more from the states!!.....
324033,Zebco,2009-03-30 15:40:00,123,"What does our license money go to in the first place?  They complain there aren't enough Mnr, they can't stock enough fish where is all this money going from our fishing license each year?  Non- resident is like double our price so they should be raking in the money.  NY non resident License cost about the same as our residents one do and they stock more fish, don't make since to me I see all the tourist heading to go fishing on the hwy in the summer, where does it go?"
324038,CLofchik,2009-03-30 16:01:00,854," The only information that's relevant is that Ontario has stocked the better part of a million Atlantics into Lake O, with captured returns measured only in the hundreds. There's enough evidence now to safely say it's a dead end that should be abandoned.  If an Australian wine company wasn't footing the bill we wouldn't even be having this discussion.    It's become pretty obvious the only way to keep Lake O salmonid fishing going is to get out and get involved with volunteer groups that are keeping the fishery going.  Ringwood, CRAA & St. Kitts fishing club are the volunteer grass roots people that will keep the fish around, not dumping more money into a ministry that gave up on Lake O a long time ago.  CRAA is doing their steelhead lift, are you going to be there?   General revenue.  The MNR's priorities are logging & mining (i.e. where the $ is), recreational fishing fell off the radar a long time ago."
324040,bigfish1965,2009-03-30 16:09:00,3382, That is incorrect. All license fees and fines and fees attributed to angling and/or violations of angling go to the MNR Special Purpose Fund. The MNR is the only Ministry with such a fund.
324043,douG,2009-03-30 16:16:00,2693,Special Purpose Accout  About $57 M annually.
324054,Paulus,2009-03-30 17:11:00,522," I agree with every point except the atlantics. I share some of your skepticism, but the ""hundreds"" you're talking about are just a preliminary figure and comprised mostly of jacks, or ""grilse."" You won't see much more than that for at least a couple years, and wouldn't even if they stocked 4 million: most of the fish just haven't reached maturity yet.  If we planted 1,000,000 steelhead in the Don right now, just because there would be no fish next year or the year after doesn't mean the experiment failed. You'd be waiting til about 2012/2013 before there was a significant run.  So, to be fair, it's way too early to really be able to say that the Atlantic Salmon project failed. My own opinion is that it will work, BUT (  ) with a population that is not self-sustaining (such as steelhead) & will require stocking to be kept up. I hope I'm wrong!  p.-"
324095,Grimace,2009-03-30 19:43:00,2020,  Ontario is a big province.   I do not think all of Ontario fisherman should have to pay 50 more dollars a year so Southern Ontario steelheaders can have a field day every time out.  I would pay more for my fishing license if it was evenly spread through the province.
324102,aniceguy,2009-03-30 19:58:00,1094,"good to see you went back to school Craig hope all is well you should come by the ladder at least once to re visit, Jon we can firm it up next monday night when we see each other but I ll gladly take you on a uS trip when you want.  I tried to stay out of this for a long long time but ohh well I guess I couldnt lol  We need to be careful on the stocking thing, before we stock or even over stock the lake there needs to be a series of questions answered, do we want a wild self sustaining fishery that will genetically diverge, or do we want a put delay and take fishery with no regard for the carrrying capacity of the N shore streams...thats the question. While many OMNR models show the streams at carrying capacity, and lake wide recruitment being  the real issue, and that harvest is at a 30% range I tend to thing the streams have more capacity but the reason they seem to have this recruitment issue still puzzles me and harvest is way more I have seen the modelling and IMO it was written without enough data to properly model it out, I have an opinion but its just that I do believe recruitment though is due to the phyto factor, god I love zebra mussels    .  Rianbows, browns chinooks, coho's   are all naturalized and hopefully are here to stay, slowly OMNR is turning a bright eye to them and thier importance, the Atlantics regardless of an opinion and Im not going to voice one here, have some major merit to them and the program, as some work is getting done on rivers much quicker then they would have for any other species.  Yes they have moved hatchery capacity, yes they have had an inpact at the species at risk act ( SARA) the money is private money and let me make this point crystal clear.  Never ever ever in the distant past or even near future would any of the salmonids get that sort of money status or eyeballs on them, and as such its allowing other river projects to leap forward at an exponential rate. Without the Atlantics the Credit wouldnt have wild steelhead transfers in the fall, a fishway at Norval wouldnt be in the final stages of design and slated for construction this summer, SARA funding or many many other funding streams would'nt be open, cold water species benefit from this program.  Lets face another fact Zebra Mussels, and many more invasives have transformed how the lake is today, and short of dumping metric tonnes of phosphates in the lake its pretty much where it is a healthy and more importantly in balance eco system there certainly is more capacity for fish but why risk collapse  or stunted fish  If one needs more proof on what can happen when predator is begining to come out of check and a bait fish collapse happens georgian bay is pretty close to home and shows that example.  More fish and bigger fish should be the goal of any sport fishery imo and to achieve that maximization of the ability to re catch a fish is what is needed, Imagine catching a 27lb chinook in the spring on flat lines releasing it to come in at PC or Bronte with another 10lb on its girth  Harvest needs to be in line with sustainable fisheries ontario while healthythe current fishery is not sustainable if managed for self sistaining fish populations  ohh to the fish ...... . . . who cares its silver it tugged the line and brought a smile beyond that who cares"

322219,majorlifts,2009-03-26 13:46:00,171,"That place is Brown haven, fished there for years, and my fishin buddy ehg only ever caught one Atlantic there. But I tell ya the browns pile up. A blast indeed."
322257,craigdritchie,2009-03-26 15:23:00,1586," I shouldn't take the bait, but as one of those steelhead guys who isn't terribly impressed with the Atlantic salmon program, I'm compelled to respond to this.  First up, I've caught Atlantic salmon. In fact, I've been lucky enough to catch Atlantic salmon in Ontario, Michigan, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia and Quebec. I've caught Great Lakes fish, sea-run fish, and even ouananiche. See, that's the thing. I do know what I'm missing.  I don't have any beef with the fighting qualities of Atlantic salmon. They're fun. They pull drag. They jump all over the place. Just like steelhead do.  The problem I have with Atlantic salmon comes down to what marketing types call 'return on investment.' We stock one million Atlantics, yet see only a handful of fish return. Last fall the CRAA fished in the Credit River sanctuaries for three months (via special permit) and manned their fish ladder continuously, but didn't even see 50 fish in total. Less than 50 fish, from a stocking of over one million. That's pathetic.  Truth is, the Ontario government has been stocking Atlantic salmon in Lake Ontario tributaries continuously since the 1980s, with basically zero results. Even the MNR's own research concludes that this ecosystem is no longer suitable for Atlantic salmon. So why do we continue to beat a dead horse?  Imagine what would happen if we refocused our resources and stocked one million steelhead instead? History says we would see enormous results overnight. Those huge runs of steelhead into the Ganaraska River back in the early 80s, when they passed 15,000 to 18,000 fish through the Corbett Dam fish ladder each spring, resulted from stocking 100,000 steelhead every year. Fishing was pretty good back in those days. I wonder why?  Back in the heyday of the coho program, Ontario never stocked more than 400,000 fish in a given year. Most years, they stocked approximately 200,000 coho in total. Yet those 200,000 fish spawned an enormous sport fishery that created derbies, sold thousands of boats, and who knows how many millions of dollars worth of downriggers, fish finders, rods, reels, and lures.  Most of the time you could go out and catch coho, even if you didn't really know what you were doing.  Now, we stock five times as many Atlantics - one million fish, each and every year. And where's the impact?  I go fishing for a lot of reasons, but at the end of the day, I want to catch fish. It's very tough to catch a fish that simply isn't there.  So that's my beef with the Atlantic salmon program. Rather than continue to pour money, resources, and hatchery space into an Atlantic salmon program that produces zero results, I would be much happier if our government devoted even half of that effort into managing steelhead. If they did, we would once again have a fishery that would be second to none."

322267,rhare,2009-03-26 15:41:00,387,Thank you Mr. Ritchie   I felt compelled to write the same thing.
322277,CLofchik,2009-03-26 16:05:00,854,"Mr. Ritchie   You did forget two things.  1)  Raising one atlantic costs 3x more than one steelhead, because the only success has come from releasing yearlings, opposed to the fingerlings of all other  species stocked.  So the question isn't do you want steelhead, chinook or atlantics, it's do you want 2000 chinook, 1000 rainbows, or 1 atlantic.  And that one atlantic will cost more than 3000 returning rainbows to raise in hatcheries.  2)  There never were any atlantics outside of Lake Ontario.  So the only place where they are even moderately successful they are an invasive species!"
322346,kemper,2009-03-26 17:32:00,2232,  Post of the year!  Stock me some steelies
322350,TDunn,2009-03-26 17:35:00,680,"   Im not saying I agree with the stocking program that is in effect for Lake O with atlantics...Honeslty I dont know much about it and never said i did. Im not a biologist nor do i work for the mnr...I just know in my home waters we have a spring run  of steelhead, summer run of atlantics and fall run of pinks, chinooks cohos and steelhead again...It is quiet the diverse fishery and i do enjoy it. |didnt mean to piss anyway off by making them think atlantics are the way to go..... I just posted the url to lake state to give you guys a little reading info on a program that has become very successful and it states the difference in browns/alantics... Sorry Craig didnt mean to hit a nerve with you......  TDunn"
322389,TDunn,2009-03-26 18:30:00,680,  steelhead and pacific salmon are native to lake O?
322393,highdrifter,2009-03-26 18:40:00,2534," Oh heck no.  That's a whole other matter.   Our native salmonids include atlantic salmon and lake trout..  And that opens up a new topic all together..  Fisherman and conservationist like to use the term wild, because some of the salmonids that were introduced reproduce naturaly.  To me, that doesn't mean wild..  The fish maybe a wild animal per say, but if they're a genetic strain that hasn't evolved in the lake through millenia, they're not wild!!"
322399,TDunn,2009-03-26 18:53:00,680,  my point exactly....on the invasive part   TDunn
322443,craigdritchie,2009-03-26 20:16:00,1586,"Hiya TDunn  No worries about stomping on any nerves .... just wish we could have something to show for all the time and money that has went into trying to introduce Atlantic salmon to Lake Ontario. It would be interesting to see what would happen if the MNR put that kind of effort into your area, where the habitat allows greater rates of survival.  In Lake Ontario, it just makes sense to go with what works. We wouldn't have to strip too many wild steelhead to come up with 400,000 or 500,000 stockers, and it would make all the difference in the world."

I should have put one on the wall.  I knew you were fishing up there, I just didn't want to write it.  I still think that fish is an atlantic, but we'll never know.  Sinker"
321125,rhare,2009-03-24 09:29:00,387,"   No we know, its a brown. If you  caught some atlantics like you said you did before then you wouldnt be arguing up and down that it could be an atlantic.  So say your right, it has some spots on the gills, a few spots above the LL.  But the tail section looks nothing like an atlantic and easily id's it as a brown."
321128,solopaddler,2009-03-24 09:36:00,8605,"Nice fishies fishinfool!  But c'mon now fess up......  Those fish were all flossed with cigarette butts, bonked then later smothered in a marshmallow sauce and washed down with a nice Banrock Station sauvignon blanc.  Right?  "
321153,River Rat,2009-03-24 11:50:00,161,"yep. although I never did hook the humpies in the 80's....I did see them in the rivers out east a few times. Back when the lakers used to come way up the east rivers too.  as for the atlantic river, anyone that figues out where those fish were caught has been there already.  RR"
321161,ehg,2009-03-24 12:11:00,2666,"Good to see you get out there for some of that good fishing Stan. Can't get enough of fishing that place, it really rocks in January or February when no other boats are there.   Here is a link to an Atlantic caught there in past. http://www.ofncommunity.com/forums/index.p...t=0&start=0"
321163,Guest gbfisher,2009-03-24 12:22:00,0,good stuff Ryan...but I don't see any spots on its tail....and fish never look different than they do in pictures......  You know Squat!!! Id say Sinker has caught more trout and salmon in 2 years than you have in your whole life. I feel pretty confident that goes for more than half of you here knocking him.
321182,highdrifter,2009-03-24 12:54:00,2534, LMAO..  a little comic relief is gonna go a long way this morning!!  GROUP HUG??!!
321187,tonyb,2009-03-24 13:04:00,1637,"Just saw this thread and thought I would add a picture of a Lake O. Atlantic next to a Lake O. Brown.  As you can see, it's easy to tell the difference once you know what to look for.  A KEY identifying characteristic that doesn't fluctuate like spot patters can, is the base of the tail and shape of the tail...  It's skinny and slightly forked on Atlantics and stout and square on Browns.  With that in mind, you'll never mis-identify these species.  100 % Atlantic   100% Brown Trout   Tony"
321198,kemper,2009-03-24 13:24:00,2232, thank you sir
321210,rhare,2009-03-24 13:42:00,387,      Well look whos stiring the pot again Im not knocking anyone.  Maybe you guys catch 1000's and 1000's more fish then me..... but at least I know what Im catching    Thank you tonyb
321216,highdrifter,2009-03-24 13:59:00,2534, Did you send in scale samples to a fisheries biologist?!!

321260,SHAD,2009-03-24 16:37:00,134," BEST reply ever on this board! So true, so true  TONY 2 DA B has MAD photoshop skills boyeeeeeeeeee!"
321271,rhare,2009-03-24 17:01:00,387,"     I never said you have never caught an atlantic either, I was simply making a point.  theres no need to get bent out of shape over a debate about a fish neither one of us caught. rigger season is just starting there's a whole summer of atlantic debates to be had"

321278,highdrifter,2009-03-24 17:30:00,2534,"Tony, I'm still waiting...  unless you post the results of that scale sampling..  you couldn't possibly be a 100% sure..  That fish could very likely be a juvenile chinook or coho..  If that's your only photo of a supposed salar, you're not exactly an authority on the matter are you?!  Not trying to discredit you, just trying to prove a point."

320920,camillj,2009-03-23 23:04:00,1988,heh .. I miss the splake .. they were great eating and the returns were there .. if not self sustaining...Id much rather see splake stocked than atlantics ... and that pink meat .... mmmmm mmmmmm goood !
320953,CLofchik,2009-03-24 00:06:00,854,"Ah jeez not this crap again...........   Okay, just assume there are NO Atlantics, because their survival in the lake is ABYSMAL. I know I know, you have a friends uncle who once caught an Atlantic.....good for you.  Really.    Can we just go a month of trout & salmonid fishing without somebody piping up ""gee looks like an Atlantic""?  Please? Because it's not.  P.S.  EVERY trout & salmon flake their scales off easy in the lake.  Because they're growing.  Fast.  So they shed."
320957,Sinker,2009-03-24 00:10:00,8692,  How about you take a pill??

320973,MJL,2009-03-24 00:31:00,2427,"Great catches FishinFool!  Those fish certainly look like browns to me...As for the debate on whether to stock Atlantics VS steelhead/pacific salmon, I thought they were trying to reintroduce them since the 80's (at least in Wilmot creek) with little to show for it.  I've also read that Atlantic salmon suffered from thiamine deficiencies when they feed mostly on a diet of smelt and alewife.  Both smelt and alewife contain an enzyme which breaks down thiamine (vitamin B-1) which results in low reproductive success.  Not sure what other baitfish there would be in Lake Ontario that Atlantics could eat."
320974,kemper,2009-03-24 00:32:00,2232,brownie   nice fish guys
320976,irishfield,2009-03-24 00:37:00,26272,It only matters if you ate it Stan !!!  Nice fishies no matter the breed.
320980,fishinfool,2009-03-24 00:41:00,366," I personally would not eat anything, any size out of Lake Ontario. All the fishies in question are still out there swimming and glowing.  Stan"
320991,Guest gbfisher,2009-03-24 00:58:00,0,Atlanticish type looking fishy...  Huh...3 spots on its gill plate....hmmm....white gums....hmmm....  
320992,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-03-24 00:59:00,0,restoring a native species is hardly a waste of resources. thankfully these decisions aren't just made based on returns in terms of numbers or angling success
320996,Sinker,2009-03-24 01:07:00,8692," Geeze.....I""m glad someone agrees  I'd like to know the Key ID features that tell you that fish IS NOT an atlantic??? How can you be so sure?? Just curious..... ......please enlighten me.  Sinker"
321009,Guest gbfisher,2009-03-24 01:33:00,0, Im not sure that's a good thing Sinker....
321014,rhare,2009-03-24 01:38:00,387,"    So what is the purpose then? If returns and angling success are no factor what so ever then why are OUR tax dollars going towards a program thats whole purpose is to bring back a fish that was unable and has been unable to sustain its self for decadeds.???  Sounds like a feelgood news story if you ask me, money could be much better spent cleaning up the lake or stocking more successful sport fish. Our stocking progam is dismal when compared to the US program. Thank god they spend money on more then just unsuccessful programs"
321017,Sinker,2009-03-24 01:43:00,8692," But of course it is  If the atlantics are going to fly, we gotta work on our streams first. They won't reproduce without the proper habitat. I think that's where most of the money is going.......before we can improve habitat, we gotta make sure we know exactly whats causing problems, and fix them from the roots. This takes time and money. Give it time......it MIGHT work.  Sinker"
321023,jdmls,2009-03-24 01:53:00,575,"I gotta get down there and give that a wirl.... They must crush your lure, those BROWNIES  Beauty fish fo sho .... I wish they stayed that pretty when they come in the rivers"
321030,Guest gbfisher,2009-03-24 01:56:00,0,ah common..  .everyone knows that Atlantics smash lures/fight harder than browns..........
321035,Sinker,2009-03-24 02:09:00,8692,  Have you ever caught an atlantic? Ever had one in your hands? Ever released one into a trib around here? ............I thought so  Never fished the nuke either huh.........hmmmmm........you know everything eh
321051,GBW,2009-03-24 02:46:00,8460,shut this down before it goes crazy...
321057,GBW,2009-03-24 02:51:00,8460,"again, the reason I think this should be shut down.  The pissing contest can go on and on and on so what's the piont when the poster stated that all the fish were let go to swim another day?"
321059,River Rat,2009-03-24 02:54:00,161,"Sinker , did you even look at the pics I posted ? I agree that the head has an atlantic kinda shape but the tell tale sign that that fish is a brown is the section of the tale ahead of the fin....fat brownie tail. Look at my pics, ALL Atlantics are long and slender in the wrist with a slight fork in the tail.....some other guy was able to count to three....(spots on the gill plate) and that makes it an atlantic?......  My fish were all stocked, clipped fresh water Atlantics......look again. I have many more pics if you actually need more proof.  RR"
321065,Cudz,2009-03-24 03:02:00,2652,Nice fish. I am pretty sure the first one is a freshwater drum.
321067,Sinker,2009-03-24 03:04:00,8692," Yep, I looked at your pics a couple times. I would agree that those are atlantics. Those are some large rivers your fishing there though, where abouts did you catch them?   Lake O or tributaries?"
321069,Guest gbfisher,2009-03-24 03:05:00,0,The experts have spoken Sinker....guess ya gotta give..  ... and stay on yer meds will ya!!!...........
321071,GBW,2009-03-24 03:12:00,8460,"I am no expert BUT the angler did say that all the fish went back so why let this go on?  I swear it could have been a ____ but wasn't sure so I didn't post.  It's ok, let it go the fish went on to fight another day..."

320435,Newfieman,2009-03-22 23:24:00,19,Yep another good day.  Big or small it was a great day.  there is nothing like reeling in an jumping brown.  Just being able to get out at the end of march in good weather is awsome.
320529,Sinker,2009-03-23 02:23:00,8692,"Does nobody else think that first fish is an atlantic???? Look at the spots on the gill plate, and how the scales are coming off. I think it is one for sure.......anyone??  Sinker"
320542,craigdritchie,2009-03-23 02:46:00,1586,Fish in the first pic is definitely a brownie - look at the tail.
320545,Sinker,2009-03-23 02:55:00,8692,"  I'm looking, but not seeing anything? What should I be looking for?"
320560,GBW,2009-03-23 03:28:00,8460,"sinker, after looking at the MNR site and pic 1 it looks like a Brown mainly because of the tail shape, flat.  not a >"
320570,jace,2009-03-23 03:59:00,472,"it's hard to tell from the picture.   The mouth is longer than most atlantics but that's not always the giveaway to identify them.  The same goes for tail forking, a lot of atlantics have fairly flat tails so it's not a reliable way to identify.  The  sure way is inside the mouth which we can't see here"
320579,Sinker,2009-03-23 04:14:00,8692,"Since when does an atlantic have a forked tail?? Maybe as a parr, or smolt, but by the time they reach the lake, it might be slightly concaved, but not forked.......pretty much the same as a brown.  I dunno about that fish. For some reason, I still think its an atlantic . Maybe its the slenderness, and lack of spots on the gill plate that is throwing me off.......or maybe Im just looking too hard. It sure looks different from the other ones.......??  You didnt' happen to keep it did ya Newf? Then we would all know for sure........but I guess if you did, you wouldn't want to tell anyone huh?  Sinker"
320583,silvio,2009-03-23 04:32:00,433,"Atlantics got 3 spots on their gill plate usually, also got forked tails, and spots usually wont exceed below the lateral line, silver coloured scales that will flake off when handled, 8-12 anal rays, unspotted tail.  Personally I think its a brown due to its colour, the spots below the lateral line, and its fairly squared tail but wont rule Atlantic out. I seen a small 12 inch fish today that also looked like an Atlantic but hope it wasn't. Most people are unaware/ prepared to handle a delicate fish like atlantics ( not this situation looks to be handled fairly well). Stocking seems to have some success now and allot more rivers are receiving stocking of atlantics now. I believe this time around they stocked a different strain that seems to be a bit more successful then the others stocked. were still a far distance from the finish line. If it continues to progress hopefully within a few years well have fishable runs.  Nice fish bud"
320586,Sinker,2009-03-23 05:07:00,8692,"Well, the flaking scales is what got my attention, then I noticed the 3 spots on the gill plate. I'm usually pretty good at IDing fish, but this is a tough one. The mouth could be a little far back, and the spots do go below the lateral line......so who knows......could go either way I guess. I know if I caught it, I'd be checking it out a little closer.  Sinker"
320591,rhare,2009-03-23 09:52:00,387,"100% a brown. The spots are spread well below the lateral line, more spots on that fish then on an atlantic. Different face then an atlantic.    The atlantic stocking pogram is a waste of money. They intend on spending another 5million dollars over the next 5 years!! since may 2006 almost 1 million atlantics have been stocked on the canadian side. Last year was the best returns with not more then a handful returning. So whats the point?  They are not stocked for eating and chinny's and coho's are a better sport fish anyways. just my 2cents"
320601,River Rat,2009-03-23 11:19:00,161,"That fish is a brown....I have attached some Atlantic pics for comparison. No tail pics but look at the ""wrist"" area leading to the tail. Atlantics have a very slender, longer wrist than the pudgy browns.....and the tail isn't really forked, but not square...kinda in between.  RR     "
320603,danbouck,2009-03-23 11:26:00,4380,I see the Atlantic debate is back!
320605,River Rat,2009-03-23 11:33:00,161,it's only a debate if you've never caught an Atlantic....that fish is a brown.  RR
320606,rhare,2009-03-23 11:35:00,387,    That sums it up right there!!!
320625,craigdritchie,2009-03-23 12:21:00,1586, I couldn't agree more. Can you imagine the sport fishery we would have on our hands if they stocked 1 million steelhead? Or 1 million coho? I can guarantee the returns would amount to a lot more than 35 skinny fish.  The Atlantic salmon program is a complete and utter waste of resources on every level. They're the new splake.
320640,Guest gbfisher,2009-03-23 13:04:00,0,looks kinda Atlanticish to me....
320846,fishinfool,2009-03-23 19:51:00,366,"I can tell you one thing for sure! They sure are fun to catch, end of story.  Stan"
320866,Sinker,2009-03-23 21:05:00,8692,"Well....whatever  I've caught my fair share of atlantics too. Just never lake run fish. I just thought maybe that could have been an atlantic the way the scales were flaking off and lack of spots on the gill plate. I know fresh water atlantics look a lot different than saltwater run fish, so I was just hoping maybe it was an atlantic. They weren't fishing far from duffins creek, and its been stocked with them......so who knows.  You guys seem so sure its a brown,  I still think it might be an atlantic myself.  I'm still on the fence  with regards to stocking atlantics. I'm all for a self sustaining fishery, but the watersheds still need a lot of work in order for them to successfully reproduce. Its gonna take a few years to see results, so don't count it out yet.  S."
