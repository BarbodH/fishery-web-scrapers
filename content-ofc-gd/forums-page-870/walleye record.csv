326378,outllaw,2009-04-05 00:24:00,1232,looking at the ofah rewads for big fish i noticed. a award for a 37.20 walleye. is this the new record. caught on erie last year
326379,BUSTER,2009-04-05 00:27:00,1336,"thats fat,  i cant recall but how much bigger is it ,cmpared to the old record?"
326384,ozaibak1,2009-04-05 00:31:00,401,"Holy moly, wow! Definately would not have imagined those still exist in eerie considering the fishing pressure, but that's why its a 'Great' Lake. Wonder how many that size have broken off due to equipment failures?"
326388,Terry,2009-04-05 00:42:00,14456,"that would be inches not lbs or is it lbs...not I would have to see it  37.20  ""  baby, not a breeder yet...LOL      now if you say it's that many lbs I would really like to see it"
326396,e-z-out,2009-04-05 01:11:00,1052,Terry you look young in that pic how old is it?
326397,bigfish1965,2009-04-05 01:12:00,3382,Any claim without a picture is just a story....
326399,kickingfrog,2009-04-05 01:13:00,8333,You and photo shop Terry!
326413,Greencoachdog,2009-04-05 02:01:00,8163," I can see why that ""thing"" bit your hook, it was starving to death!!!   Yup!     Terry is right though, OFAH awards are for inches... not lbs."
326494,Terry,2009-04-05 11:30:00,14456,"I was a member of this forum when I caught it, but I can't remember when there is no photoshop there...for sure  and you are right it was one skinny fish but long and I mean long"
326497,Roy,2009-04-05 11:57:00,13728,Hey Terry?  Nice shirt!!!!
326500,danc,2009-04-05 12:01:00,4677, That's my favorite too Roy. I'm guessing that Terry went fishing right after church that day.
326503,Terry,2009-04-05 12:17:00,14456,"one must dress for success....LOL  but really, I got warned that I was getting way too much sun, so I started wearing long sleeve shirts"
326504,Roy,2009-04-05 12:23:00,13728,"Vitamin D will never hurt you Bud. Lack of it will.  edit:  Sorry, didn't mean to highjack the thread."
326548,fishboy,2009-04-05 14:57:00,550, I'm disappointed in the lack of a tie...nice fish though
326556,irishfield,2009-04-05 15:16:00,26272,Like to see a picture of that one George..  ..and Terry.. just how old IS that blue jacket??
326564,kickingfrog,2009-04-05 15:40:00,8333, Quality never goes out of style.
326576,outllaw,2009-04-05 16:05:00,1232,the pictures on another website. . i dont know how to import it.
326578,irishfield,2009-04-05 16:09:00,26272," Right click on the picture George. click ""properties"".. copy that and then come here and type [ img ] [ /img ]  and put the properties between them with no spacing between the [ and img or the brackets and the properties."
326627,irishfield,2009-04-05 18:27:00,26272,"outlaw sent me the picture of this 37.2 inch 'eye. Guess the guy has a LONG torso because mine is only about 27"" from below the belt line to above my eyeballs.."
326632,kickingfrog,2009-04-05 18:36:00,8333, That is a very nice walleye.  But I don't see how it could be 37.2 inches.  Let the games begin.
326720,BassAsin,2009-04-05 22:41:00,806,i agree! 
326905,Cookslav,2009-04-06 04:53:00,1457,"Its a nice Pickeral fer sure but 37.5"" might be what I would refer to as ""an excited guestimate"" Probobly no measuring tape at hand so it was eyeballed....but that being said I'm no expert and am well aware that Photos can be a bit tricky to judge some times especialy with out the tape handy.  But.... It gives me a chance to post my PB 32"" Pickeral as a comparison    32"" and nothing more"
326906,gone_fishin,2009-04-06 05:06:00,481," good enough for me... LOL. Nice Fish!!!  here's another 32""er... for... ummm... comparison also...    "
