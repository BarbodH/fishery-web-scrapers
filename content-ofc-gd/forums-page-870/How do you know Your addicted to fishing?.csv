325551,bassassin,2009-04-03 00:49:00,152,"You own a boat and you can count on one hand, how many times you've taken your boat out and not fished!!  I am one of those people.... "
325555,richyb,2009-04-03 00:53:00,774,"I have never been on a boat an not fished , accept for that one time on the midland 1000 island tour boat  haha."
325563,jediangler,2009-04-03 01:11:00,1923,I rode the ferry from Manitoulin island  to Tobermory one time without fishing.
325564,irishfield,2009-04-03 01:12:00,26272,I got my boat out on Saturday... but the water's still a tad hard to go fish from it...
325568,bassassin,2009-04-03 01:17:00,152,"In six years of haviing a boat im up to two times being on the water without a rod on hand, one of those times the waves were to high so we never got started....."
325603,bigugli,2009-04-03 02:22:00,6138,Problem?  What problem?  It's the rest of the world that's a few screws loose.    Yeah.    That's it. Fishing's good for you.
325701,GeorgeJ,2009-04-03 10:54:00,207,"Well I have two fishen tackle boxes in the bedroom right now, plus magazines and books related to fishing in at least a couple rooms of the house.That could be a sign of an addiction, maybe."
325713,bigugli,2009-04-03 11:44:00,6138,"Not enough tackle yet. There are only 2 rooms in  the house lacking fishing gear. The TV room (all Disney), and the bathroom (a Wife thing  )"
325717,cranks bait,2009-04-03 11:59:00,721,"I've always fished out of my boat.  I'll take a break and take my nephew tubing, but then it's back to business.  Even when I am a safety boat for the triathlon, I get some fishing in before hand.  I don't fish when I take the Glenora ferry though.  They troll too fast."
325736,Fishnwire,2009-04-03 12:53:00,983,"You know you're addicted when evertime you're packing up your gear at the end of a day's fishing, you're already thinking about when and where you'll go next.  That's what I do."
325744,suds,2009-04-03 13:27:00,70,I talk about fishing while making love  suds
325868,GeorgeJ,2009-04-03 17:53:00,207,  oh man you are brave  ! definitely addicted...
325873,nautifish,2009-04-03 18:06:00,1416,Addicted.  This is just one room in my home if i could i would have every room in my home look very similair to this...          And when this grl says her room yes i mean this is my room . Done with my own hands and my hangout where i can sit and ejoy reading my fishing mags which may i add i have boxes and boxes of.
326021,ohhenrygsr,2009-04-04 00:55:00,947,  Whatever cranks i almost got hooked swimming by you during the triathlon LOL.  I think it's impossible for me to go on a boat without a rod. But i should try trolling behind our local ferry it's perfect musky speed
326026,irishfield,2009-04-04 01:19:00,26272, She's just hoping that he switches from that little ice fishing rod to a stream rod really soon.....
326029,tdotfisherman,2009-04-04 01:23:00,317,"I know I'm addicted to fishing when up at the cottage I pass on a nice piece of trim in order to get a good night's rest, and wake up the next morning at the crack of dawn to hit the water."
326036,GeorgeJ,2009-04-04 01:42:00,207, or switch from a light action to medium action!
326056,Angler16,2009-04-04 02:52:00,188,Had my tackle box in my room since late February lol
326062,Pavel,2009-04-04 03:11:00,9,When I am not on the river fishing I am spending all my time looking up info online about fishing and I know I am addicted when everytime I drive over or by a river I can't help to look over at it and it has almost caused me to get into an accident before.
327014,MikeFisher,2009-04-06 15:52:00,6,"addicted?? don't know how to call that, but the facts: you enter my house and to reach the front door on the Veranda you have to pass a dozen of rods'n'reels which did not fit on the boat actually. when she tell's me about the different vacation destins to choose my answer is: giving her the credit card to book where SHE wanna spend that vacation, sure i stay myself home and use that time as a free man to just fish. Mike"
327020,Guest gbfisher,2009-04-06 16:01:00,0,Addiction....PHHHHHHT!  I can quit any time I want. It's not me that makes me fish. It's the others!......
