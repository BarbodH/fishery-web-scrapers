326911,ohhenrygsr,2009-04-06 06:01:00,947,Well it was a beautiful day to get out for a drive with the girlfriend.  First stop was the local walleye spawning grounds.  I didn't see any walleye in the actual current it was really strong.  So i started to scan the slack water and notice the flooded backyard of the house on the right and found them.  I dunno how the owner of the house on the right of the river puts up with the flooding waters that happen every year.                 Can you see them?     How about now?     Umm would you?     The house.     I guess it's pretty cool to be able to say that you had walleye and suckers swim on your lawn lol

327098,gdelongchamp,2009-04-06 18:34:00,199,"Just out of curiosity, how do you know they are not suckers spawning? Otr have they already spawned in your area?"
327101,ohhenrygsr,2009-04-06 18:38:00,947,the majority of the population will be walleye but the suckers will be there too.
327124,misfish,2009-04-06 19:58:00,29133,Great shots Henry. TFS
327139,Cudz,2009-04-06 20:27:00,2652,Great shots.  Those eyes look huge.  Why can't I catch Simcoe walleye??? East side of lake always gets pwned by ice.  My friends cottage is about 100ft away from the water and up a hill and the ice still manages to wreck something every year.
