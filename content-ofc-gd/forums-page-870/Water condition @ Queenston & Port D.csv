326471,RuNnYoOzE,2009-04-05 04:38:00,270,no real fishing guy would try it after all this wind and rain! The fish would have retreated to deeper water!

326693,Zebco,2009-04-05 21:13:00,123,Won't be that way for long lotta ice comming down the upper and a whole lot of mud!
326924,huey graphite,2009-04-06 11:39:00,362,"  Great looking fish. This pic, however had to have been taken before this weekend as the lower river was full of ice."
326939,rhare,2009-04-06 12:33:00,387,   Full on saturday after the big wind storm pushed a bunch of ice over the boom  Sunday was fishable hardly any ice.
327174,Bondar,2009-04-06 21:29:00,817,"water has less than a foot of vis today , ice pushed out but the river is very un predictable this time of year, yesterday whirlpool was jammed with ice today it was pretty much empty i suggest coming back in july  lol  "
327180,Bondar,2009-04-06 21:32:00,817,give your head a shake
327190,Streamerguy,2009-04-06 21:41:00,121," huey, take a look at the bottom right hand corner of the pic and you will see the date and time Sat morning was a freak of nature cause that rarely happens there and if alot of ice shoots down in the morning it should be gone by afternoon.  Shoot me a pm next time and I might be able to save you a trip...  cheers Streamerguy   Nice catch wiser..Don't you work lol"
