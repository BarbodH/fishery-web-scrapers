We got up, headed out of the city and arrived at our destination around 9:30am. Started fishing @ our 1st location - nothing hitting, not even snags!  So, after fishing that area for about 30min - we decide to hit another location a lil more north of where we were. MAN!! Was it crowded!! Must've been at least 100 people there, MINIMUM!! ... But man were the crowds worth every minute of it.  I gotta tell you, today was the 1st time I've got to use my Centerpin for more than 2hrs fishing. What an awesome experience!! Now I can fully understand why most anglers prefer this type of fishing over anything else - Every little bit of weight of a fish, felt like a tonne, especially since we're  all running pretty light line (most was 8lbs). Most of us got our PB's ever...Catching 1lb sunfish, bluegill, and the very odd perch! Managed to catch 1 bass oddly enough - that was pretty cool!  The pictures of all the crappies - he kept the smaller ones, because my lil cousin wanted to keep some to fry 'em up - whatever, his choice. Anyway, here are the pics! ENJOY!!       ***************************************************************** ***This perch was obviously attacked by a Pike recently... and it SURVIVED!** *****************************************************************        ***************************************************************** ***************This catch was unexpected and a surprise!**************** *****************************************************************     "

326907,EC1,2009-04-06 05:17:00,930,"Nice catch!! Today is the last day before the cold front kicks in, and I dont know how the fish are going to react to this."

326910,ozaibak1,2009-04-06 05:40:00,401,"Nice perch and crappie, nothing wrong with frying a few up just had a nice feed myself  Good on releasing the larger ones, wouldn't mind seeing a pic of them, looks like a fun day with many more to come with the slowly improving weather."
