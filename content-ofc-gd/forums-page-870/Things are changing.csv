Cant say Im too impressed. We moved from the big city to get, what you would say a, natural living. Woods and wild life.Barrie sucks now.It,s just like the big city. Money grabb,n   .   Pay no mind to the women behind the camera.LOL"

Killed a lot of the local colour, and the economy.  I'm still amazed they haven't torn out ""Gasoline Alley"" . There are a lot of dead businesses and derelict properties already on the stretch to Orillia"
