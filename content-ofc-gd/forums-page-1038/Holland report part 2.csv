195150,jjcanoe,2008-05-01 21:35:00,744,"Part 2, Das Boot  Das Boot!   Our ride for wreck fishing   Heading out of the harbour only 40 more miles to go!   This guy disturbed our fishing for a few minutes. It was about 350 meters long and kicked up about 3 meter waves   Vertical jigging is the way to get these guys with live bait rigs (super sized ones again) or with jig and plastic minnows . (don't get snagged on the shipwrecks)   really fun when you have 2 on at once.   I ended up with 10 altogether best about 5lbs but there were some big ones caught and between the 12 guys on the boat we kept about 40kgs once they were all fileted. Made for one giant fish fry on Tuesday!  Getting ready for the trip home   What's a trip to Holland without a picture of a windmill! Here's where they keep them now.   Anyone headed to Goderich to the Maitland R. heres what it looks like from 12kms up.   Triton Charters jjcanoe"

195260,HTHM,2008-05-02 00:58:00,4082,"Had I know you were going I would have asked you to bring back Jonge Jenever, and Borrel Nottes, verdorie!"

195377,ricoboxing,2008-05-02 11:12:00,398,"nice report. i went to holland 9 years ago to visit my grandma, wish i went fishing while i was there."
195421,snag,2008-05-02 13:00:00,1932,That windmill pic was cool.  Great report
195442,tbayboy,2008-05-02 13:46:00,1497,"I spent $30 just in shipping fees to get 2Kg of droops (licorice) to my dad for his birthday, if only I'd known you were going .   Its great to see some fishing from over there.  My grandfather always said he's real reason for coming to Canada had nothing to do with post war economics or bitter feelings (took him a long time to get over the war) but instead was because he could fish every single day anywhere he wanted, my earliest fishing memories are with him and my bad getting smelt and my grandmother preparing the bucket loads we brought back.  mmmmm."
195492,John,2008-05-02 15:39:00,2956, Can get you droops here in Burlington. PM me if you are interested.  J...
195508,tbayboy,2008-05-02 16:23:00,1497,"Thanks John, I'll remember that though I think he was just as happy to get the import label to show off his 'from the old country' droops to his friends as he was to get the damned things (I love most dutch stuff - got a box of hagelslag in the fridge right now - but I can't stand droops)."
197212,jjcanoe,2008-05-06 01:39:00,744,"There's gotta be a dutch store or 10 around Toronto area, we have 2 in London there's one In Chatham, one in Burlington, one in St. Catharines that I know about, but it's just not the same as the ""fresh"" stuff from over there!  jjcanoe"
