I was asked to display a rigged yak.  I believe that the fishing yaks, there will be Heritage, Hobie, Native, Ocean and Wilderness Systems.... at least that's what they carry in-store.  Stop by and say ""Hi"", I'll be the one with the Jack Russell(Gordie) in his PFD pulling the yak all around.  Sorry for the short notice, but I myself was just invited today.  Hope a few of you can make it out!"
195348,jediangler,2008-05-02 03:44:00,1923,"Thanks for the info. I'll try to drag my little girl along so we can try out some tandems.  Is it ""rain or shine""?"
195373,NAC,2008-05-02 11:05:00,369,yes rain or shine.
195527,jediangler,2008-05-02 17:57:00,1923,"Thanks, hope to be there."
195529,jediangler,2008-05-02 17:57:00,1923,I'll bring a rainsuit.
195561,CLofchik,2008-05-02 19:31:00,854,"Anybody going to be selling ""previously enjoyed"" boats?"
195713,NAC,2008-05-03 00:50:00,369,  I can't say for sure because I do know that they sell their rentals off each year but when that is I do not know....  sorry. you could always call them
195965,charlied,2008-05-03 20:36:00,584,"i am to far to go and check them out.  i got a kayak for xmas, just a small 12-14 footer....any recommendation for fish finders that i can possible put on it, preferably portable.  any info would be great, gonna try and use it alot this summer as i am 2 minutes from lake erie and Niagara river."
196073,NAC,2008-05-03 23:50:00,369,I have the H-bird 535 portable that I use on one of my kayaks.  I bought portable to use on the ice as well and got a base for the kayak then attached it to a RAM mount - works real nice. silicon the transducer to the flatest part of the hull and hook up a gel cell battery  what type of kayak are you putting the sonar on?  there's lots of kayak rigging tips/diplays/help on the Ontario kayak fishing site - Yakfisher.net   BTW - the subject event is running on Sunday as well.
196078,johnnyb,2008-05-04 00:15:00,3413,Hey all you yakkers...CTC has a fishing kayak on sale right now...in the weekly flyer which is viewable online...FYI
196096,Mike Pike,2008-05-04 01:09:00,1332,"Hope you had yourself a good day out there Nomad!  And just a reminder if folks couldn't make it out today, it's also on tomorrow( Sunday )!  Sounds pretty neat if you're interested in buying a kayak because you get to test paddle a bunch of models and 'try before you buy.'"
196189,charlied,2008-05-04 05:01:00,584,"I have a Pamlico 100 by Wilderness systems.... Not top of the line but good for what I wanna do with it, plus a longer one would be a problem when putting it in my truck cab...LOL.  I looked at that fish finder also, but it looked kinda bulky for me, I would have to see it in the store to see how big it really is."
196810,NAC,2008-05-05 16:41:00,369,  Thanks Mike!  It was a bit of monsoon on Saturday but things appeared to have went well. Several people purchased fishing kayaks and whole lot more got intested in it.  Good to meet a few of you!!  see pics;              
196906,charlied,2008-05-05 19:10:00,584,"NICE KAYAK THERE....I can't do all that with mine.  Mine is similar to the blue kayak in the 3rd pic, there are 3 kayaks in front of yours, mine is like the blue one.  Guess I will have to improvise when added stuff to my YAK...LOL"
