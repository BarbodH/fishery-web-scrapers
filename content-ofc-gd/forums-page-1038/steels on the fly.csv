I was fortunate enough to head out last weekend to a buddy's fishing camp.  Here is a pics of one we took on glo bugs.  All in all, it was a great morning, hooked 6 and brought in 3. The water was clear enough for me to see the fish take on 2 incidences.  That's gotta be the most exciting part of fishing.  Can't wait to head out again... "
