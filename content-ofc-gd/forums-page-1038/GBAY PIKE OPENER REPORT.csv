197126,snagmaster,2008-05-06 00:22:00,250,Thanks for the kind words guys....Hopefully will get into some walleye next weekend...either hitting the Kawarthas or Quinte.....this weekend warrior thing is killing me and its only my first day at work....lol
196312,snagmaster,2008-05-04 15:45:00,250,"Hey guys, Spent thursday and friday this week up on Gbay with my girlfriend chasing some pike. We arrived on the lake at 11am on thursday and the weather was great but the winds were out of the east. Started hooking into them right away tho. We fished till 30clock and then headed over to check in at the lodge. I managed 6 or 7 pike and and a few OOS smallies and largies. Heres a few pics from the first day    A nice chunky 32''     The next morning was pretty rough. Cold ,windy and raining...Fishing was tough . Talked to two or three other boats and everyone was getting skunked. I still managed to land 6 pike that day but had to work for them. The key was going slow with long pauses. No pics of fish that day because the wather was way to rough for my GF ( camerawomen/netgirl) on the boat.   After we checked out from the lodge the next morning we thought we would go out on the boat as it wasnt raining. The first 45 min was nice and calm with no rain and then it got ugly but the fish were on ....In an hour and a half I managed to land 8 pike and loose 2 more and even got one nice aproximate 12lber. heres a few fish.    the biggin of the weekend....was only 34'' but was atleast 12lbs....never seen such a fat pike....big shoulders too   It was  great Pike opener . Lots of fish lots of laughs and even my GF hooked a nice bass...lol....yes I was proud. Have seen the action a bit betteron opener but thats only with sunny skies and winds from the west. With the cold rainy front I was shocked we did so well. All fish were caught on stickbaits. The tally for two days for me was was 20 pike all between 28'' and 34'' and 5 or 6 OOS bass. Can only Imagine how good it would be if the conditions were optimal...   Thanks for reading and goodluck on the water"

196340,Want,2008-05-04 16:42:00,39,It just feels plain good seeing somebody out on the water at last and landing some decent fish. Just a few days more and hopefully I'll be out there too. Nice pics.
196342,bassfighter,2008-05-04 16:48:00,366,"You are making us drool!  Give us your secret on how you found or tamed your women into this fishing sport.  Before I married my wife, she was fishing with me all the time, and caught lots of bass(bass was abundant years ago without even knowing how to catch them), and the last time she grabbed a rod was 15 years ago. Can't complain though, for my wife is supportive of me going fishing with my buddies.  How's your school exam?  When are we going to hook up? I am still waiting for the water to warms up a bit before taking the boat out, but it is ready to go anytime.  josh"
196345,snagmaster,2008-05-04 16:56:00,250,"thanks guys ..... hey joshua , I know Im a lucky guy that my gf puts up with my fishing addiction....she likes it batter when she can tan on the boat tho...lol.....Im looking to head out to wabashine for some walleye today but have no one to go with ...you free...let me know soon as its getting late"
