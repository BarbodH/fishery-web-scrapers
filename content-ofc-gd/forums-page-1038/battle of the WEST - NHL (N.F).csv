(well, in a long, long time) Time right now...just between the 3rd and 4th OT 1:59am. The kidz best watch out....Be it 'burg or the Wings.... These 'MEN',  play big time hockey...and its for real.... ...anyone else catching this game?  If sanJose takes this game..... I dunno...they were down 3-0 in the series Either way...both these teams are leagues apart from the East."

Coincidentally, this game is on the anniversary of the 5OT game a few years back. Go figure!  Did you see the look on ref's face after the no-goal? He was ticked that the game won't end! lol"
