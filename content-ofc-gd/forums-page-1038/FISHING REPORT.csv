196510,DMASSE,2008-05-05 00:42:00,420,"Hello  We decided to try and hit a eastern trib...  With the water blown  and looking like chocolate milk, we decided to go fishing in Keswick for some crappies and blue gills...  After about 100 fish all small and  the crowds starting to close in on us we decided to head to Jackons point for perch.  The dock filled with people we caught tons of little guys and some nice jumbos, I mentioned that we go fishing for some carp in a locla river that I know..  It was a fun day and I caught my personal best carp,  a wopping 30+ pounder on float gear and 4lb tippet,  man what a fight..  Here are a couple pics of the carp and the monster. LOL      Dave"
