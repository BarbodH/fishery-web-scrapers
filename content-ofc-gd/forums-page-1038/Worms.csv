It wasnt all of the fish that had it . So are those white round things worms ? If so are they still ok to eat if you pull them out? Thanks Jason"
196460,Mike Pike,2008-05-04 22:41:00,1332,"Yup, those are worms.  I usually don't see them in perch.  But about 3 years ago, icefishing on Simcoe, I caught a lot of wormy perch.  After filleting the fish, I use the pointy tip of the fillet knife to just flick 'em out.  Personally, they don't gross me out.  And even if you miss a few, they won't harm you."
196463,Rich,2008-05-04 22:51:00,3927,The worms will cook out. It's still safe to eat. Just make sure you cook the fish well.  Kinda gross knowing you ate wormy perch though .. lol
196465,irishfield,2008-05-04 22:53:00,26272,You'll almost always find them in bass as well. Just pop them out like a pimple !
196471,pikehunter,2008-05-04 23:16:00,1659,"Simcoe and Couchiching perch are infested with them. Fish from Valens Conservation Lake used to be that way too, but maybe not anymore?  Funny thing, Lake Erie Perch are usually OK, go figure."
196474,steverowbotham,2008-05-04 23:20:00,1800,"I have more problems with the perch in Couch than in Simcoe.  They are safe to eat if they are cooked.  I just flick em out first, but its not necessary"
196476,Ryan Landry,2008-05-04 23:24:00,128,Almost all the cod we catch in Nova Scotia have worms. We just pick them out before we cook them.  Ryan
196492,Beats,2008-05-05 00:06:00,543,"  I went out on a fishing boat for mackerel from Halifax a few years ago and the captain told me that a good percentage of the cod that they catch out there have worms because the cod eat seal crap, and the seals have worms.  I don't know, but that's what I was told.  They also said, like everyone above, that you can either pick them out or just cooke them as they won't do you any harm cooked."
196495,danbouck,2008-05-05 00:12:00,4380,I never find them in Erie perch or bass. Maybe it's just luck
196506,livinisfishin,2008-05-05 00:33:00,661,"thanks a lot guys, feel a lot better bout eating the fish now."
196523,Greencoachdog,2008-05-05 01:02:00,8163,Some worms have an exoskeleton and will cause the meat to be gritty (not a nice touch to the meal) if not removed from the fish.  The larger Red Grouper down in the Gulf of Mexico are full of these things.
196574,chickenhawk,2008-05-05 02:10:00,612,Lake Erie fish are clean thats why Dan!
196607,Ben_Daniels,2008-05-05 03:54:00,435," When I was about 10 or 11 my mom bought cod at the grocery store and when she got it home there were still live worms crawling around inside lol she brought it back and they told her that a lot of cod are like that.  To this day my mom won't buy or eat cod, she loves perch though  -Ben"
196641,Ryan Landry,2008-05-05 06:47:00,128,A least you know the fish was fresh!
196643,jonnybass,2008-05-05 06:58:00,346, That is absolutely disgusting. I would think that the grocery store would know better than to sell food with live worms crawling around inside. I would never shop at that particular grocery store ever again.
