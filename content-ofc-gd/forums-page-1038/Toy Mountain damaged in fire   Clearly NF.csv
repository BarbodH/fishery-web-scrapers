The fire broke out around 11:30am. Sprinklers helped save the building at 150 Railside Rd. in North York, but the food, clothes and toys stored in the facility were heavily damaged by both smoke and water.  ""All of the food products donated to the Salvation Army actually moves through this warehouse,"" said Salvation Army's Ken Rawlins. ""So all of our community and family services units that provide food daily to our clientele get their supplies from this unit.""  Water damage was extensive and the smell of smoke lingered well into Monday morning promising a cleanup effort that will take days. Still, even after the cleanup is complete nobody can say how long it will take to replenish what has been lost.  ""It's very heartbreaking for us, and it's going to be a while before we're able to get back on our feet,"" said Maj. Doug Binner, Area Commander.  No estimate has been given regarding how much was lost, but it could well be in the millions.  If you'd like to help replenish the supplies lost in the blaze, call 1-800-SAL-ARMY to set up a cash or credit card donation.   Maureen"
