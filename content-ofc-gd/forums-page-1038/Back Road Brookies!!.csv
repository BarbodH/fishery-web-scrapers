197173,Rustic-Fisher,2008-05-06 01:02:00,826,"Well the game plan was supposed to be canoeing the back lakes for Brookies. But having just gotten of night shift I opted for a slower pace. Decided to cover ground and drive to some back road/4x4 trail spots that  I have fished in the past.   I was a little nervous about going to deep down some of the trails without a buddy incase we needed to pull one and other out of mud or up inclines ect..(my truck is the one pulling most times LOL..) I managed to find this years beaver dam on one of the creeks or trickles I fish and the brookies were also there. Caught loads of the 7""-9"" fish and even lost some that had to be close to 16"" in the wood (I know!!!  another fish story LOL....) but losing a few big boys is what keeps ya coming back I guess?    Great day to be out, even keep a few for a feed and they tasted great!!!   And as stated before, yes the black flies are hatching. Break out the spray.  Rf"
