196717,snag,2008-05-05 13:11:00,1932," 8-10 solid. Just kidding.  Beauties Ben!   Wha? My spots are clouded in a psychedelic haze, the mists of disillusionment!    What a perfect day for opener!  Congrats Ben!"
196718,ccmtcanada,2008-05-05 13:12:00,7971,He said SNAG...not SNAP....it's not all about you ya know.
196722,snag,2008-05-05 13:15:00,1932,It should be. That's the natural order of things.
196783,tbayboy,2008-05-05 15:09:00,1497,"Congrats Ben, some nice fish there and perfect fishing weather, who wants sun anyhow?"
196137,Ben_Daniels,2008-05-04 02:38:00,435,"Well I got out to the Toronto Islands for the Pike opener today and it was Dynamite! I got there at about 2:00 pm and fished until 7:30. Didn't catch anything until about 4:30, but from then on it was non-stop action. I caught 9 Pike, an OOS 2-3lb Largemouth, lost 2 other Pike, and had a ton of missed follows. No huge fish, the biggest was about 35 inches and I didn't get a weight on it, but I'm guessing about 6-7 lbs. All fish were caught on size 14 Husky Jerks fished pretty fast.  It rained the whole time I was there but it didn't seem to bother the Pike. In fact  I caught most of the fish when the downpours came! 3 fish in 3 casts at one point! I was standing in the rain and screaming because I was soo happy. My first fish of ""08!  .  I was dressed in good rain gear and I was comfortable so the rain didn't bother me. Didn't take pics of all of the fish because of the heavy rain...sorry Team 13!  It was packed out there! I probably saw 15-20 other people fishing, which is a lot for the Islands. Met some fellow OFNers which is always nice. Well heres the pics...  Shot from the ferry ride.   Cool fog shot, looks like it could have been up at the cottage.   First fish of '08   23 inch Pike   25 inch Pike   27 inch Pike   30 inch pike   Yea the Tourney sign started to get trashed from all the rain...  -Ben"
196143,Tinman,2008-05-04 02:52:00,376,does it count if you sign melts? lol
196147,irishfield,2008-05-04 03:02:00,26272,Looks like he ran out of sign before he got to the 35 !  Some nice fish there Ben!
196149,fatherof3,2008-05-04 03:15:00,1769,"well worth standing in the rain,congrats on a good day"
196153,mbac31,2008-05-04 03:20:00,904,Awesome report man. Good to see that someone got out.
196160,Mattones,2008-05-04 03:31:00,587,Awesome man! Sounds like you had one hell of a day.
196164,Ben_Daniels,2008-05-04 03:37:00,435,"Yea Tinman, good question... in the last pic or two you can't CLEARLY see OFNcommunity...could we have a ruling from a mod?  -Ben"
196166,irishfield,2008-05-04 03:41:00,26272,I can read them just fine Ben and anyone that can't has lost the spirit of what the tourney is about in the first place. When you print the next one.. and put it in a ziplock bag... add 2008 would ya! lol
196168,Tinman,2008-05-04 03:43:00,376,"i can read it fine too, just playing with ya!"
196170,PatrickGG,2008-05-04 03:53:00,562,Just curious! I thought Pike doesn't open till the second Saturday in May Toronto harbor is considered Zone 16?  http://www.mnr.gov.on.ca/MNR_E001335.pdf
196175,Ben_Daniels,2008-05-04 04:18:00,435,http://www.ofncommunity.com/forums/index.php?showtopic=17789  I bought my license and looked at OFC...I'm not a rocket scientist so I can't understand the Regs  -Ben
196176,Live2Fish83,2008-05-04 04:19:00,26,Good job man.... some nice looking fish....
196178,PatrickGG,2008-05-04 04:26:00,562,"Well if thats the case THAT JUST REALLY SUCKS! I would have been out there today fishing also, now i gotta wait till next weekend"
196187,mikeymikey,2008-05-04 04:56:00,376,Awesome!! Was that the only lure colour you've played with ?  PS Thanks for not blurring out the background LOL
196202,lew,2008-05-04 09:14:00,12767," Congrats on a great pike opener !!  Good to see your not afraid of some nasty weather either, it always amazes me how many folks around here cancel a fish'n trip because it's not gonna be sunny & warm.  WTG Ben, you deserve every fish you caught yesterday"
196224,mattyk,2008-05-04 11:22:00,2110,some nice fish!
196231,Chris,2008-05-04 11:49:00,405," Dude, my buddy caught a 39"" pike that went 15lbs. 2 oz. I think your pike may have been closer to 10lbs.....unless it had a toothpick girth."
196282,Greencoachdog,2008-05-04 14:00:00,8163,"Great report and pics Ben!!!  The logo is s'posed to have '08 or 2008 to be legal... but after all, it is just a for fun tourney...  I plan to laminate my logo when we all the bugs worked out, until then I print out 3 or 4 to take because of wet fish and the likes."
196288,Guest Johnny Bass,2008-05-04 14:33:00,0,Great Report! The first official Pike report of the spring and its a good one! Looks like you really cleaned house!Well Done!
196317,snagmaster,2008-05-04 15:59:00,250,"nice fish man ....way to get them in the rain....a 35"" being 7lbs ? must be skinny in the T.O harbour.....got a 35"" in gbay last spring and it didnt survive so I weighed it and was just shy of 11lbs....guess really depends on the fishes shoulders and belly"
196391,Billy - Curtiss,2008-05-04 18:08:00,241," Toronto Harbor is actually considered Zone 20. By the way, nice fish dude!"
196394,mepps,2008-05-04 18:24:00,1301,"Well done bro, wish I was there!"
196589,ehg,2008-05-05 02:41:00,2666,That's a good bunch of fish for a day from shore there. It's good for another few weeks before it gets to weedy.  Nice report and pics.  ehg
196597,Ben_Daniels,2008-05-05 03:32:00,435," I used a couple of other colors... when the sun briefly came out I had to change the color up to get bit. I was fishing solo in heavy rain for the most part though...no possible way to get any better pics. If you were really perceptive you could tell the location of one of the pics lol I've used less to recognize some of SNAG's spots.     It was a fairly skinny fish...probably better than 7 lbs but without a pic and no girth measurement...well lets just say I don't wanna be the stereotypical exaggerating fisherman lol. I caught a 38 that was 13 pounds at the Islands last year. This 35 fish had nothing on the one from last year as far as shoulders and belly.  2008 on the sign you say Irish? DOH...failure on my part to properly read the rules lol  I'll be out there again tomorrow, but with a waterproof sign  Thanks for the nice words everyone!  -Ben"
196679,bpsbassman,2008-05-05 11:37:00,941,Nice fish and report Ben.
