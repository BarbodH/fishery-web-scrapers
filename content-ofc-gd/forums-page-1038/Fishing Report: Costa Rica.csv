196828,hairywater,2008-05-05 17:17:00,15,"Just got back from a family holiday in costa Rica. Quite a surprise to me (wink wink) that the area we stayed is close to some prime tarpon waters near the Rio Sixola. Couldn't afford a charter so I consulted many boards like this (thanks) and brought a rig with me. Hired a local with a canoe and went looking for fish.  It was still and hot, nice, since the canoe is only a 12 footer, but the fishing was slow. Started looking for bait, caught a small jack &  lip hooked it and let him swim away, 1/2 hour later a poon rolled near us, I waited, he grabbed it, the hook bit  and we were of on a 1 hour sleigh ride.  Unbelievable action, runs, jumps, arm wrenching power of these fish is unbelievable.  Here are some picks.  Waiting  Got a nibble  First look  Come to papa  Thats a high as I could lift him   Saying goodbye   I reckon him in the 100lbs region.  Caught on a Ugly Stik BWS 1100 , Okuma Baitrunner, spooled with 20lbs powerpro, to a 65lbs floro leader with a #7 Gamatsu Octopus hook on the business end.  Thanks to the guys at Tightlines  Fishermans Warehouse for stocking and selling me the stuff I needed. Buy local!  I think this rig will work great on my kayak, hunting pike in Toronto Harbour  Cheers  Hairywater"

196845,mepps,2008-05-05 17:51:00,1301,awesome job!
196860,solopaddler,2008-05-05 18:17:00,8605,"Unreal, totally epic!   BTW, what's a ""poon""?"
196872,hairywater,2008-05-05 18:27:00,15,"tar""poon"""
197134,Crazyhook,2008-05-06 00:27:00,1154,"awesome fish man!!! did you get a length on him?  awesome fight eh! just came back from tarpon fishing down south, nothing like it"
197209,bassman,2008-05-06 01:36:00,384,"Nice report, and good job from the canoe. By far, tarpon has got to be the single most exciting fish to catch."
197213,Mike the Pike,2008-05-06 01:39:00,3421, Thats what I was going to say lol.  Very detailed pics thanks for that excellent report
197293,hairywater,2008-05-06 02:52:00,15,"I didn't bring a tape with me but  I think i could scale it off the length of  the zipper on my pants. I could do that in photoshop I think, any other ideas?"
197299,Paulus,2008-05-06 02:58:00,522,"Oh the irony. I really love the pic of the tarpon in the water, with the baitfish still hanging on the line. Like fishing for jewelry.  Goethe is right. Seize the day. Well done!  p.-"
197302,bpsbassman,2008-05-06 03:02:00,941,dang' Amazing
197303,Crazyhook,2008-05-06 03:06:00,1154,"fish looks about 60 pounds to me, what a beauty, some great shots!  Any sharks down there? have to watch out for releasing them, like a tic tac to a bull or hammer!"
197317,hairywater,2008-05-06 03:37:00,15,"Did not  see any sharks down there, spent a fair bit of time on the water in a kayak  trolling. Jumped a few smaller ones on Rapala's, but without the circle hook, its pretty tough to hit the sweet spot in their mouths with big trebles. Wish I had brought a fly rod, there is this lagoon........"
197327,scuro,2008-05-06 04:08:00,386,Ya hit the jackpot! Can't win if you don't play. Wonderful fish.
197343,lew,2008-05-06 08:17:00,12767,"Monstrous fish & a great tale to go with it, thanks for taking us along !!"
197370,Crazyhook,2008-05-06 11:30:00,1154,"I wish it was less windy, I had my 10 weight but do not think it would of been big enough...  you got it right about the circle hooks, I have used them before but am a real fan now.  You did it the right way with the locals man... way better feeling then forking over the big cash"
197377,TroutnMuskieHunter,2008-05-06 11:45:00,1362,WOW...what a nice fish!!.....congrats and thanks for sharing that!!
