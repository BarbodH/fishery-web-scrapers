This week I got all my steelhead equipment with the help of you guys for my b-day but it isn't till the 7th.  Anyways Iâ€™m just wondering if you guys pre-rig your shots and if so how.  Also if I should put the shots on the main line or the fluorocarbon leader.  Thanks,  Tibbs"
196946,splashhopper,2008-05-05 20:26:00,2931,on the MAIN line and use the smallest ones u can... a few extra small ones spread evenly down the main line works the best for me.

I almost always put shots on my leader - Sometimes as close as 8-9 inches from the hook.  Never had a problem with it weakening.  It's just what I have confidence in doing and it works.  When I pre rig my rods+reels, I normally just put the shots that I need to noodle up the float (The ones directly below the float).  I leave the rest to put on when I get to the river.  Happy b-day when it comes around"
