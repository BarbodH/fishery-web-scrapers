196750,superdad,2008-05-05 14:00:00,353,"The opening weekend is always a great time for meeting and greeting fellow fishers after a long winter.  Bayview Resort was alive with campers and cottagers and boats and trailers - everyone eager to fish and start the season.  Our 'Three Amigos Fishing Team' was ready and anxious to go. Who are the Three Amigos??? - Laker John, Superdad and Superdad's Dad - Superbert.  We were ready to go with the game plan set. Headed out Saturday at 0615 and headed to some bigger water. Began fishing at 0645 and set out the planer boards and flatlines. Water temp was 48.7 degs F.  That would set the tempo for the day.  Made our first pass and the flatline with the Husky Jerk Clown went off and Superdad's Dad landed the first fish of the day - a nice 5.75 lber.  Good Start.  We trolled for another hour and the flat line went off again and Superdad landed a nice 6.75 lber on a Husky Jerk (blue/silver&orange).    We trolled for another hour and half and the planer board went off and Laker John took his turn and said, ""This is a big one"".  He fought and SuperBert swished with the net and the fish was ours. Boy - what a size...  This one goes to Picton Bay......  Travelled to Picton Bay and had the fish weighed.  We were told that this fish put Laker John in 5th place, as of 1130 Saturday.    It was 11.2 lbs and was 29.5 inches. The lure was a CC Shad!!!!!  We headed back out full on confidence and hoping for a 12 lber. The afternoon kinda slowed down and SuperBert was into another fish off the planer board. As the fish came to the boat I could see it was anothe big fish, but as the net was swiped, the fish flipped and the hook flew out - DARN.................  A lost fish doesn't lose your spot in the fish rotation and shortly thereafter, the flat line bent again and Superbert was into another fish. This one didn't throw the hook and it was ours.  A quick Picture and a rapid plunge back into the water of Quinte. The Husky Jerk worked again.    We fished til 1700 and called it a day, we had spent a long time out there and Superbert is 87 years old........  Sunday Morning the rain began at 0400 and it was gloomy around our place. Dressed in rain suits and headed to the boat - hey the sky to west is clearing - Maybe it will be an OK day?????  Left at 0700 and headed back to our fishing water and started trolling, marked a lot of fish and baitfish and the water was up to 52.0 degs F.  Made a pass and headed back into a slight breeze, nothing to worry about. Turned theboat to head back down wind and the white caps were appearing - Uh OH!!!!  As we trolled down wind the wind speed increased and the white caps grew, it was futile to try and troll up wind and we trolled easterly for 40 miinutes, bouncing and bouncing. This is crazy. Pulled the lines and headed west at an angle to the waves and wind and motored slowly back towards the campground.  We spent an hour trolling in front of Bayview Resort as the Saturday fishing there had been outstanding..... We marked a lot of fish but the cold front had put the fish down.  Landed at 1200 hours and called it a weekend.  We went to Trenton for the award ceremony scheduled for 1700 hours, we got there at 1650 and half the prizes had been awarded. we just made the Senior Walleye category and they called Laker John's name.    John rec'd a nice pair of prizes and we headed back to Kingston, well satisfied after our weekend.  All in all, everyone had a good weekend and from what we could see and hear everyone landed fish, some bigger than others but they are all walleyes.........  Congrats to the winners and to all who competed in the Walleye Weekend.  Cheer"
