Also on couple of websites  it says that i can park all along York blvd and just go down one of the trails and fish. any info is appriciated, ty"

197330,CLofchik,2008-05-06 04:21:00,854,"I think he might be talking about the carp barrier Solo, wrong end!  There's a small area on York Blvd. next to the bridge on the S side where you can park and walk down to the water, but there's two problems. 1)  It's posted ""No Parking"", but everybody ignores it and parks there anyway.  I've never seen anybody ticketed, but you never know. 2)  If you are carrying alot of gear (dang high-tech carp fishermen!) it's a VERY steep, long walk.  A better way is to park at Princess Point, there's a paved walkway out to the carp barrier.  Bring a buggy or cart if you want to bring in alot of gear, it's around 600m walk.  Kind of funny to get to:  http://maps.google.ca/maps?f=d&hl=en&a...040169&z=15  Carp fishing is just starting to warm up, still needs a few weeks before a few thousand carp pile in there."

I`ll give it a go today after work and see how it goes. Thank you very much for the info Clofchik, its appriciated!!"
197366,pikehunter,2008-05-06 11:18:00,1659,"Bayfront Park, Pier 4 is a good place to park and follow the trail along the edge of the water to the canal. The bridge here is known to the locals as the ""High Level Bridge."" At least to the older folks."
