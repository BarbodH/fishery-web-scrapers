In one of the city’s stores, he picked up a mirror and looked in it. Not knowing what it was, he remarked, “How about that! Here’s a picture of my daddy.”  He bought the “picture,” but on the way home remembered that his wife, Lizzy, didn’t much like his father. So he hung it in the barn, and every morning before leaving for the fields, he would go there and look at it.  The man’s many trips to the barn began to draw Lizzy’s suspicion. One day after her husband left, she searched the barn and found the mirror. As she looked into the glass, she fumed, “So that’s the ugly W i t ch he’s runnin’ around with.”"
196614,danbo,2008-05-05 04:23:00,2646,"An attractive woman from Toronto was driving through a remote part of Abitibi when her car broke down. An Ojibway Indian on horseback came along and offered her a ride to a nearby town. She climbed up behind him on the horse and they rode off. The ride was uneventful, except that every few minutes the Indian would let out a “Ye-e-e-e ha-a-a-a” so loud that it echoed from the surrounding hills. When they arrived in town, he let her off at the local service station, yelled one final “Ye-e-e-e ha-a-a-a!” and rode off.  “What did you do to get that Indian so excited?” asked the service-station attendant.  “Nothing. I merely sat behind him on the horse, put my arms around his waist, and held onto the saddle horn so I wouldn’t fall off,” the woman answered.  “Lady,” the attendant said, “Indians ride bareback.”"

""Well,"" says the man, ""I was having a nice round of golf with my wife. She sliced her ball into a pasture of cows. We went to look for it, and while I was rooting around, I noticed that one of the cows had something protruding from its rear end. Sure enough, when it lifted its tail, there was my wife's golf ball.""  ""And?"" asked the doctor.  ""Well,"" the man said, ""that's when I lifted the cow's tail, pointed, and yelled to the missus, 'Hey, honey—this one here looks like yours!'"""

He tried unsuccessfully to get the gorilla to leave, so he called a gorilla-removal service, and soon a serviceman arrived with: a stick, a Chihuahua, a pair of handcuffs, and a shotgun.  “Now listen carefully,” the serviceman told the homeowner. “I’m going to climb the tree and poke the gorilla with this stick until he falls to the ground. The trained Chihuahua will then go right for the privates of the animal, and when the gorilla instinctively crosses his hands in front to protect himself, you slap on the handcuffs!”  “Got it.” the homeowner replied. “But what's the shotgun for?”  “If I fall out of the tree before the gorilla,” said the serviceman, “shoot the Chihuahua.”"

One day the dog died, so Muldoon went to the parish priest and asked, “Father, my dog is dead. Could ye be sayin’ a mass for the poor creature?”  Father Patrick replied, “I’m afraid not. We cannot have services for an animal in the church. But there is a new denomination down the lane, and there’s no tellin’ what they believe. Maybe they’ll do something for the creature.”  Muldoon replied, “I’ll go right away Father. Do ye think $5,000 is enough to donate for the service?”  Father Patrick exclaimed, “Sweet Mary, Mother of Jesus! Why din’t ye tell me the dog was Catholic?!?”"
