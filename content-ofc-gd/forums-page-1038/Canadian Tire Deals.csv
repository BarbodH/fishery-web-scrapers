Anyways stopped by the clearance section in the store and they had a bunch of fish finders on sale for as much as 50% off.  I know there were Hummingbird Piranha's regular $199.99 going for $99.99 and there were a couple other varieties as well.  They had about 4 humming birds and about the same in other brands nothing too high end but decent little mid-level products.  if anyone is in the area looking for a fish finder go check it out.  They had a few other things as well, a couple lures and I picked up a folding Ice Auger, reg 129.99 for 49.99, but I think that was the last one.  -cheers  fwf"
