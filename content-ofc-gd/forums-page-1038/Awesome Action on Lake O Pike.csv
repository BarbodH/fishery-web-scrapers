196367,chickenhawk,2008-05-04 17:30:00,612,thanx misfish!
196401,mepps,2008-05-04 18:35:00,1301,Nice!  Did you eat any of those pike?
196412,ranger520vx,2008-05-04 19:14:00,164,No I dont eat them Mepps-these ones were transported and released later in a new area.
196539,spoonman,2008-05-05 01:21:00,103,Ranger great day for sure. I was out all day today Sunday will post report tomorrow. Nice to cast some lures again. Cheers AL
196587,ehg,2008-05-05 02:33:00,2666,"Nice going on the pike results. It is much better to fish from boat there, especially when it gets weedy later.  Is it legal to remove those fish and put them somewhere else, i don't know?"
196725,snag,2008-05-05 13:22:00,1932,  I definitely want to hear an answer to this.  Where (approx.) were they moved to?
196734,ranger520vx,2008-05-05 13:32:00,164, Caught were they were trapped in a backwater area that has lost most of its water and released just outside of it.
196743,ehg,2008-05-05 13:47:00,2666, There is something fishy about this story. I guess there was enough water to get your big Ranger in there. That belly up pike should fare well.
196745,ranger520vx,2008-05-05 13:51:00,164,"  Ranger was beached and we fished from shore, put the fish in well when caught. The Belly up one was throat hooked and consumed."
196784,blaque,2008-05-05 15:10:00,2419,"the ""assumptions"" continue..... lol. Sounds like a guy posting an honest report and doing something with the fishes best interest in mind......yet is still being accused of wrong doing?  I think Ranger has answered all questions in a very cordial manner, which he didnt have to do considering the way they were posed."
195995,ranger520vx,2008-05-03 21:20:00,164,"What may have lacked in size made up in quantity. We saw some big girls behind our lures but they kept missing. Once the committed, they were ""spent"".  That make sense as the warmest temps we found were a hair under 48 degrees. Saw dozen fish over 15 lbs,  largest landed for was was 8 pounds. Landed 25 between 4-6 lbs.  Focus on 4-7 feet of water, slow retrieves the key with chartreuse lures.  I'm testing a new soft plastic system out and first results were impressive in areas fished with spinnerbaits and jerekbaits previously caught fish we didn't know were there.  Sorry Team, but none I wanted to put a tape measure to as I usually get a couple of 40 inches in late May.  Nice to have met some OFNers out there.     "
195996,Zubris21,2008-05-03 21:23:00,563,The fish in the first picture looks really yellow!  Nice catches!
195997,irishfield,2008-05-03 21:25:00,26272, From eating all them little Carp!!  Good start to the season there Ranger!
196000,ranger520vx,2008-05-03 21:33:00,164,The yellow was weird for sure>  Irish- i'll pm you some other details.
196005,Mattones,2008-05-03 21:39:00,587,Good color on that fish.  Where abouts on lake Ontario did you go?
196006,young_one,2008-05-03 21:42:00,620,"Excellent report, I wish I had the chance to go out today. Glad to hear the catching was good!"
196010,jediangler,2008-05-03 21:47:00,1923,"I think that it is a pickerel not a pike. The pattern towards the belly really looks like a chain pickerel to me. Rather than bean shaped spots like a pike it's spots are so big that the area around them resembles a chain. If you have another pic of it, put it up. On another topic. Why is there a wine cork in your live well? Here is a pic from In-Fisherman of a chain pickerel, looks similar. "
196019,ranger520vx,2008-05-03 22:02:00,164,Must have been the French girl left that in there last nite-Chateau De Esox-1998.  Its my livewell overflow plug dude-that my story and stickin 2 it. My wife lurks here for Gods Sake.
196024,ranger520vx,2008-05-03 22:06:00,164,Its the infamous Canary Pike.  
196031,steverowbotham,2008-05-03 22:17:00,1800,"Man, I wish I got ot today"
196093,Ben_Daniels,2008-05-04 01:05:00,435,Nice fish Mark! I think I saw you motoring around...My report is coming in about 20 min....  -Ben
196109,Jigger,2008-05-04 01:36:00,1237,Sounds like a grewat day man. looks like you're trying to do an on-board live release lol. Congrats on a good day!
196117,Ryan Landry,2008-05-04 01:59:00,128,"Looks like you guys had a nice day on the water. We also got a few today, I'll put up a report later.  Cheers,  Ryan"

196220,jonnybass,2008-05-04 10:54:00,346, Good luck on getting a reply to that question on this board!
196268,perodimi,2008-05-04 13:31:00,124,"Hi all,  Nice pix of the pike!  A couple of questions:  1) Do you need to have a Toronto Harbour License if you want to fish there?  2) Where's the best place to launch? I'm in the north end of town so prefer to know if there's one on the Leslie Street Spit or on the east side.  Thanks"
196289,Guest Johnny Bass,2008-05-04 14:40:00,0,Great Report! And right downtown Toronto! Some day I will have to get my Harbor License.
