Going down will be semi OK but going back up..... It can be done but this boy wouldn't do it and I use to run it all the time! Now if you are talking about from the falls down but not going through the shoot..... That's a different story. I fished that area for many years with everything from a 9.9 to a 25. The Flat Rapids with a 9.9 can be a little dicey in a 9.9, a 15 no problem.  let me know what area you are talking about."
