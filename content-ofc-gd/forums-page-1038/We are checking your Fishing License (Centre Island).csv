They were starting to feed. Some not all.   But the cold winds came back and then themps dropped, drove all the carp back into deeper water not even the smell of a carp was around. If you're heading to the island make sure you have your license. They were checking today. make stops everywhere they see someone fishing.   They were on the move. I lead them to this guy  We'll they asked me. ""If I seen any other person fishing?"" I can't lie so.    Cool boat I might say. Wonder how fast this baby can go?  dsn  Pike is next !!!"

196945,Whopper,2008-05-05 20:11:00,2174,Border Patrol on Lake Erie runs a couple of those and I can attest to how fast and quiet those boats are. First time we saw one of them was right at dusk and we were running about thirty knots when out of nowhere one of them pull right along side of us.
