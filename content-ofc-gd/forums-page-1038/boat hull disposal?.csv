196746,HookNrelease,2008-05-05 13:54:00,85,"Hey guys looking for any reasonable suggestions, I found a stripped out hull of a boat similar to my own, and was trying to get some parts off it as they are not available anymore from the manufacturer due to age and model, such as the quarter window that the kids lost for me ;D etc,, long and short was the marina said i can take anything i want as long as i dispose / remove the hull from their yard, jerks, said i could even borrow the trailer its on to move it,,, so does anyone know of an econimical way to dispose of a 22ft fiberglass hull approx 2500 lbs,,,???? im figuring  its not practical nor cheap.  thanks  Ian"
196768,BITEME,2008-05-05 14:30:00,1969,Just take it to a landfill and pay the price   OR  saw it up over a few weeks and take it bit by bit and not pay as much  one way or another your gonna pay
196772,HTHM,2008-05-05 14:36:00,4082,Put it on KIJIJI as a project boat. There is one born every minute........

Use the website to find the group(s) near you, and send an email ""offer"" saying it's up for grabs, free for the removal.  After it's gone, you send another email saying ""taken"" and you're done.  I'd be shocked if it wasn't spoken for within 24 hours.  You wouldn't believe the junk I see people happily adopting on our local group."
196950,Uncle Buck,2008-05-05 20:34:00,1000," I tried that...  couple people said they'd ""take"" the boat if i gave them the trailer...  i then asked them if they wanted the 150HP O/B to go along with it, they said if i didn't mind...  1 guy only showed up, with a 16ft trailer (tongue to the back) and 1 keel roller, no bow stop, bunks or anything...  I kind of laughed cause i told him the boat was 18ft long on the phone..."
