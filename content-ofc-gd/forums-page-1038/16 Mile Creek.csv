196034,Mattones,2008-05-03 22:21:00,587,I havent gone fishing in almost 9 years so I bought myself a new rod today. Since moving to Burlington from Barrie  When I come home from work I drive along Dundas(HWY 5)coming back to Burlington and always see cars parked along Dundas where the 16 Mile Creek passes. I was wondering if that area of the creek is decent to catch some fish? is not where about along the 16 Mile Creek is a good spot:)  Also what fish have you or hear that people have caught along the creek?
196102,workwear,2008-05-04 01:26:00,592,great trib for steelhead.......spring and fall........most tribs along lake ontario are good.....just have to find the honey holes...good luck
196136,Mattones,2008-05-04 02:36:00,587,I think I may go along the Dundas part tomorrow morning by myself with a little bit of my gear and see whats its like.
196250,lunkerbasshunter,2008-05-04 12:30:00,2585,there is bridge construction at dundas and 16 mile so you may have to head up stream or down?  the lions vally park entrance is closed for what looks like another year.  cheers!
196265,Mattones,2008-05-04 13:17:00,587, Oh really construction eh? I see cars parked along Applbey heading to Milton. i may try there then:)  Thanks.
196311,huntervasili,2008-05-04 15:44:00,1604,that would be Bronte rather than 16 mile then
196403,Smed,2008-05-04 18:38:00,20,"I live on the river at the area in question, fishing has been OK, stressing OK, on the lowest part of the river at hwy 5 fishing has been very below average this year.  Smed"
196487,Baldy,2008-05-04 23:50:00,44,"The 16 Mile does not get anything close to the runs of salmon & steelhead that Bronte & Credit get.  The run that it does get is spotty at best.  I think that the 16 Mile is slightly colder than Bronte and the Steelhead could last a little longer there. Are you certain that it is the 16 Mile where you are seeing vehicles?  More likely it is the Bronte, usually Bronte gets a lot of activity this time of year whether the steelhead are long gone or not."
196573,Mattones,2008-05-05 02:10:00,587,EDIT- Removed Info.
196583,huntervasili,2008-05-05 02:28:00,1604,"Bronte... try and keep EXACT locations off the board though... ie street name, if you can make the edit that'd do a heck of alot of good"
196709,BITEME,2008-05-05 12:44:00,1969,THERE ARE NO FISH IN OAKVILLE CREEKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!
196780,mikebuns,2008-05-05 15:01:00,12,best bet is to go to bronte for steelhead although ive caught some steelhead in the 16.  the 16 mile creek is better in the summer for those beauty smallies on the fly
196904,CLofchik,2008-05-05 19:08:00,854,"All the Oakville creeks are pretty much done, was a pretty crappy run this year for all the rivers in the west and most got blown out early with the warm snap before season opened.  16 Mile does get a good early fall run at the end of July every year, makes for fun pier fishing for a week."
197115,Mattones,2008-05-06 00:12:00,587,I think tomorrow if i get off work around 5 and home by 5:30 that I'll go and check some places out.
