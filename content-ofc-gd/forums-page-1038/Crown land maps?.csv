197245,Zubris21,2008-05-06 02:03:00,563,"just wondering if anyone knows of any online resources to free crown land maps?  I like to do a lot of camping during the summer but I find park fee's tend to add up.  I know there is lots of great crown land out there, but my searches for maps online have offered little direction."
197251,muskymike,2008-05-06 02:05:00,772,I have often wondered this myself and am interested in the responses. I have never researched it at all....I just get lazy and go to a cottage
197252,irishfield,2008-05-06 02:05:00,26272,Here.. go anywhere you want in Ontario.  Zooming in and once you get small enough it will switch to more detail. Shows crown/patent land/etc.  http://crownlanduseatlas.mnr.gov.on.ca/clupa.html
