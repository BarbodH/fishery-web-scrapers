Saturday morning I got up early, put on my long-johns, dressed quietly, made my lunch, grabbed the dog, slipped quietly into the garage to hook the boat up to the truck, and proceeded to back out into a torrential downpour.   There was snow mixed with the rain, and the wind was blowing 50 mph.  I pulled back into the garage, turned on the radio, and discovered that the weather would be bad throughout the day.    I went back into the house, quietly undressed, and slipped back into bed. There I cuddled up to my wife's back (now with a different anticipation) and whispered, ""The weather out there is terrible.""    My loving wife of twenty years replied, ""Can you believe my stupid husband is out fishing in that crap?""    I still don't know if she was joking."
