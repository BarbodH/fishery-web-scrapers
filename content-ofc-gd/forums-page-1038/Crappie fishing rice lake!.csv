196791,MuddyWater,2008-05-05 15:32:00,218,hello im heading up to rice lake for walleye opener this year and after i limit out with this new small limit i wanted to start loading up on crappie if anyone wants to point me in a direction on rice that would be sweet. ive caught some huge crappie jigging for wallys in their but just random ones. i know what to use tubes and little fin S fish but some spots to try would be sweet!! peace
196809,addict,2008-05-05 16:41:00,475,"if u get your limit of eyes,instead of ""loading up""on crappie why not try some catch and release.the new walleye limit is more than enough for a feed."
196812,MuddyWater,2008-05-05 16:43:00,218,because they are crappie and i like to eat them. and i will catch and release lots of wallys but if their is crappie in their why not try for them to
196959,linweir,2008-05-05 20:45:00,202,Depends on where you launch your boat. Rice lake is large. Look for small bays near deep water. Serpent mount Park is a good spot to start.
197019,Smokey,2008-05-05 22:18:00,1278,"The crappies are still quite shallow with the cooler water temps this year. Find the bays as linweir mentioned and fish the holes in the weeds and the edges. Down by Bewdley there are a few good spots, just look for all the boats and in and around Cow and Long Islands should still be holding a few.  Best of luck with the eyes and get out and catch and enjoy as many of the crappies as you want.  I'll be watching for a report, especailly on the eyes as I'm working this weekend and can't get out till monday.  Mike"
