Decided to go down to Dunnville to try my luck for some cats and some carp but the wind was blowing really hard, it looked something like this     The highlight of the day was bbq we started and grilled some meat.   Did manage to catch one bullhead but didnt take a picture of it, too emberassed lol After Dunnville, decided to check out elora gorge, i was determined to catch a fish that day. After all rain river was really high but wasnt muddy at all. Usually river in these spots is half as wide and has some really nice  pools where trout like to hide, but wasnt meant to be this weekend.      These last 3 pics are above the mill, first time being there really kool place, saw couple of fish jump but no takers.    Second last pic is in St jacobs, last year there were couple of nice  browns caught there and there is some bass there but thats gonna have  to wait for couple of more weeks.  The very last picture is me in a bumper cart. There was a fare close to home and its funny what guys will do for girls, here is a proof.   Hope you guys enjoy the pics"
