114631,BREAK,2007-09-17 13:59:00,2,Anyone have any idea how the fishing is on Honey harbour....i was wondering if muskie are swimming in these parts...and what time of year is it easiest to catch them?
114636,ccmtcanada,2007-09-17 14:05:00,7971,No idea about that....head down there and throw some lures...that's the best way to know for sure.  Welcome to the board!
114639,TennesseeGuy,2007-09-17 14:25:00,957,My friend and his wife honeymooned there in 1959.  Don't think he caught anything.  New wife's health card was current.

115392,BREAK,2007-09-19 17:04:00,2,thanks for the help!!!!!!!!!  Went last sunday and caught some decent PIKE!!!!! my second favourite thing to catch.
115393,ccmtcanada,2007-09-19 17:07:00,7971," Hey...great job!  I find the only way to know for sure is to head down there and take a look.  I fish almost exclusively from shore (cant afford a boat), so doing the legwork and trying is the best way to find the fish.  What was swimming around and biting one day can be completely different on another day.  Glad to hear you got out and caught some fish!"
