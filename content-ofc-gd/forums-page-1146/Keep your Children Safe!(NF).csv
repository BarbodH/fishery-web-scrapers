115383,smokinall4s,2007-09-19 16:40:00,89,"I would like to put my two cents worth in. I feel bad for these parents of the children that died but not all fast food places are the same. My wife works for a fast food restraunt and she has a play area also, but without a ball pit. She has also been at one that has a ball bit. Now, she ran both of these places and I know for a fact that she had her ball pit cleaned out every week, meaning totally emptied out and cleaned. She also has her play area at current place thourghly cleaned every week but also regular cleaning daily.  But, like I said, not all fast food playgrounds are managed the same. My wife takes care of hers mainly because we too have kids and she wants them and other kids to be safe when playing in the playgrounds.  That's my 2 cents worth, thanks"
115389,Roy,2007-09-19 16:55:00,13728,"Smokinall4s, I'd like to nominate your post as as post of the year. I still have tears in my eyes."
115395,MJL,2007-09-19 17:10:00,2427,"While those cases may purely be myth and legend, the truth is there are indeed sick and twisted people who live amongst us.  On more than several occasions, I've heard of reported cases (on the news) where razor blades, needles and glass were strategically buried in sand at local playgrounds and beaches and/or glued on playground equipment like slides.  Who's to really say what limits these people put on themselves to do other things.  Kind of makes you think what can happen to your own kid or someone that you may know and love."
115397,John,2007-09-19 17:13:00,2956,I clean my ball pit daily......

115516,Rizzo,2007-09-19 20:20:00,4754,"you guys are truly sick (funny, but sick).  I know stuff LIKE this has happened though.  Where I played beach volleyball in Toronto we found boards buried in the courts with exposed nails pointing upwards.  It was fortunate they were discovered before somebody got seriously hurt."
