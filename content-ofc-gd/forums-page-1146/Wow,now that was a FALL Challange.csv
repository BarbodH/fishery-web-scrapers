114701,misfish,2007-09-17 17:11:00,29133,"WOW what a weekend.  First off let me congradulate one of our members on a super job,Greg Klatt, who he and his partner won with 2 very impresive bags of fish.    Also to another Mark Kulik and his partner Patrick Chow on a top 6 finish.Great seeing you again Mark and Patrick.  Where to start. Well we woke up to a cloudy/windy/rainy morning and we knew it was going to be a miserable day,but after all,why else would it be called the Fall Challange.  With the cold nights and wind we expected a tough bite. Both myself and Ryan knew where we were going to fish and we were going to stick with our plan and not go away from it. Blast off time and we make the trek down the lake blasting off 30th. It went smoothly,heck we even past a couple of boats,but also got past by a few ourselves.LOL  We arrive at our spot and there are two other boats there as I expected to see more we were happy to see only the two.We start with tubes and wizzle worms. I decided to short,n the lenght of the worm as I figured the bite would be finiky.  We werent more then 30 minutes into it and we had three fish in the well,about 5 and a half pounds.Our saying this weekend was,get five to be alive.   We worked very slow,allowing the biats to sit for a few seconds,twitch and pause and twitch some more.It was very boring but working. We were not getting the bigger fish,but as long as we were catching,we hoped it was only a matter of time before we would be rewarded with some bigger fish.  With the wind picking up the bite was getting tougher.Harder to see our targets to hit,and with the over cast sky,it was even harder. Being set in our mind to stay on the spot,we continued and was rewarded with 2 more fish that put us up to the 8 pound mark. The boy was pretty excited we had our five to be alive and before noon.  We worked the area til around 1 pm then it was time to hit the second spot.So tie everything down for the wild ride up the lake and off were heading. As we approuch our next spot ,we see a boat on it,so now it,s time to think without losing time boating around looking for used waters.I remembered a spot with a drop off and head there.No one insight. We continue with the same pattern and right off the bat,the boys got one on. It was close to a cull ,but back it went.Ok he,s happy hes catching. Hit a floating dock,I make a long cast.Just ticks the platform,down/ line goes slack,set, reel ,reel ,reel as the fish is chasing me to the boat,try to set twice but it managed to spit.   As 3 pm draws nearer we hit a few docks and a couple of tied up boats. We were able to land one fish that replaced one of the smaller ones. Time to head in for the wiegh in. We knew we didnt have big wieght,but it is a two day tourney so there is always the next day.  Our wieght for a tough day on the water was 9.28. Turning out to place us in 30th out of 53.  A few pics from day one.            Again,this was the young lads weekend to experience the excitement of the tourney.        Sunday comes early and the winds have died down and clouds are starting to disappear. Knowing  that we had to find 20 + pounds of the green fish to even have a chance,we knew it would take some luck. We headed right to where we started the day before. I have alot of confidence in the spot and it holds good fish,we just had to find them and put them in the boat. Water is calm,sun rise looks great and were thinking big fish. This day we arrive to find only one boat this time .Great ,more area for us to cover. Again,we go with the same set ups. With the sun starting to climb and the water near glass,it was easy to pick our targets to hit. There must of been a eating frinzy going on because we were catching. By 8 am we had 5 fish in the well, but again no big wieght.7 pounds maybe. We just kept plugging away. Dragging the tube and worm put a real hurt on the line as we broke off 3 good fish. Even with checking regular,at times you get caught up and forget and that cost us probly 5-6 pounds of replacement fish. We could see the fish this day aswell,but like at the last tourney,I said we could see them,so they can see you.  Around 11am,were thinking we got to try something different, these fish just are not going to cut it. So we decide to go looking for deep weed buckets.This is when the day took a turn. Go to pull up the trolling motor and SNAP F%^&%$^&%$#^. Try everything to release the latch with a small screw driver (the only thing I really had on the boat that would work) no luck. The only thing I could do was remove the motor from the bracket when travelling and put it back on when we got to our spots. Time consuming to say the least. We worked 3 areas that had some real nice weeds but only managed a few small fish. So with an hour left,we decide to see if that fish from yesturday,had returned to the cover of the floating dock. This time waiting to be a little closer,I throw,wait,nothing,chuck again to the otherside,wait,nothing.Ohwell,move on. We had not thrown to this one floating dock as  the day before it was behind where we started. As we approuch the platform,I noticed it,s just on the edge of a weed drop. Throw the worm and wham,fish on. Nice 2+ bucket. Well that replaced a smaller one in the well giving us just over ten. Ryan changed up to a white spinner bait from the tube and worked the weed bed as I continued to throw the worm. Nice cabbage all around the platform, but that fish seemed to be the only taker. That time had come again to head in and to see what would happen.While lined up,we could hear the wieghts being announced and there were some low wieghts,even lower then what we thought we had,so we looked forward to see if we climbed up a bit. As we approuch I tell my son to look over at the docks. I had a suprise for him. I asked the parents to come down to see him at the wiegh in. He was pretty over welhmed they came down from Burks falls just to see the wiegh in.  We are greeted at the at the docks and Ryans proud as a peacock to reach in and grab the fish and show his grandparents as he puts them in the fish bag. Off he goes to the line up,I think his chest was sticking out abit more then normal.LOL With his turn to go on the stage he gets a bit of a cheer,you could tell that effected him. Fish get wieghed.Turned out to be just shy of 11 pounds.Giving us a two day total of 19.90.Good enough to move us up to 22nd. So we climbed 8 spots. Not bad for acouple of amatures eh.  Pics from day two        Like I said,chest looked alittle bigger.      Again it was great to get out with my oldest and to see him with smiles from ear to ear.  Thanks for reading.
