Needless to say the boys got really bored and went off playing as you can see in the pic.  Ethan really enjoys watching the bats fly around at dusk and it was a pretty calm night so it was at least nice to get out for a bit.All in all a pretty slow evening for the boys

At least they are asking you to get out and I will bet they will remember this evening and all the rest of the boring ones to come far differently than you.  Way to go, getting them out of the house is what it is all about.  Cheers, Jen"
