Now, my question is: Will it be worth our time to check out the creek for migratory fish?  I've never fished in this situation before, but would definitely want to try it out. Right now, I'm currently chucking spoons at piers, so not entirely sure how different this will be. Should I fish with a float? I'm spooled with 10lb mono at the moment...perhaps I should go lower, like 8 or 6? Lure/bait of choice would be roe right? Do I have to get into the river with waders, or will walking the shoreline be good enough?  Any advice, tips or suggestions via replies or PM's would be greatly appreciated  Thanks."
115470,Marko,2007-09-19 19:27:00,854,"Its going to be really shallow. If you plan on throwing your float in there you probably should go with a lighter fishing line, 6-8lb range. You are going to have to find some deeper holes and you can try floating some roe in there. Good luck Thats all i really know"
115474,frozen-fire,2007-09-19 19:32:00,542,"thanks for the reply. if i don't go with a float, could i throw hard baits and spoons? i'm assuming it's not going to be as good as roe."
115482,tonyb,2007-09-19 19:44:00,1637,"Unless we get a ton of rain between now and then, leave the rod at home and enjoy your hike.  The fish haven't run in any major quantity yet.  Tony"
115493,xrap,2007-09-19 19:56:00,683,"Better off at the pier. The creek is very low, and even if you were to float fish the deeper pools the water is gin clear."
115519,huntervasili,2007-09-19 20:35:00,1604,"There arent gonna be migratory fish up that far yet... we still need alot of rain. You may though encounter some Smallies, I have seen a couple in there..."
115545,Milty,2007-09-19 21:51:00,121,"90% of the time ,..once up river,...(not too mention near the mouth of the river),..throwing hard baits and spoons results in snagging,..the salmon are out of their feeding mode and concentrating on making it home for some Nookie,...you need the more subtle approach when up river,...roe (small bags and singles) ,..wet flies and jigs in reddish type colors will aggrevate them into a strike sometimes,...as for actual feeding it is rare once upstream.  Make sure you appraoch very subtly as though you were targeting browns or steelhead,..these salmon once in spawn mode spook even easier. ,..Oh yeah,..almost forgot,..wait for more rain ...lol.. Hope that helps!!!"
