One place we always get salmon now has new owners and won't let anyone on  property.... Found another spot and thrashed through bush....NOTHING! So we then went to a farm paid the farmer to let us roam the river....NOTHING...not even a chubby lil minnow...... So last but least checked out the Notty by Alliston......Absolutely-positively ........NOTHING! So have came to the conclusion, there must be like 2 terrified Salmon with 100 fisherman trying to catch em!!!! Maybe in a week or so will try again....  Lorissa"
113843,glen,2007-09-14 16:28:00,2641,The salmon should be up by now.  Someone said there are a few in Angus.  Maybe the run is real small again this year.  Who does stocking in the notty?  Why cant Georgian bay be like Lake O?  Stupid fish.
113856,jdmls,2007-09-14 17:18:00,575,Ya have to agree that last season was a poor run...THnaks for keeping us posted.....Been thinking of heading up to alliston ..PM me regarding your next trip
113860,Fisherman,2007-09-14 17:29:00,7201,"Nobody stocks the Notty, all natural runs. Lack of water levels sure doesn't help.  As for the Pine,  remember it closes on 30 Sept for everything."
113987,Milty,2007-09-14 22:28:00,121,"I was up that way a week ago and saw a dozen or so,...and have had plenty of rain since,..so there must be fish,..maybe just not holding where you were,...Im goin again soon and am confident in a nice set of pics..."
113991,boatman,2007-09-14 22:36:00,350,"I just came back from Grey-Bruce. No fish spotted in any of the streams or rivers I travelled including the Beaver, Bighead, Sauble, Saugeen, or Sydenham. Waterlevels are still near historic lows in all Southern Ontario streams. Water temps mostly around 16 C."

114201,fishindevil,2007-09-15 22:47:00,6254,"Well even though the water is at an all time low the tribs east of the GTA have salmon in them ganaraska,the wilmot & bommanville,as well as oshawa creek..  .i dont know why they are not up where you guys were i saw a few people fishing this morning and they were draging about a 20lb chinny up the sidewalk,a block from the creek.....so check them out there is fish here.  ...cheers"
115240,daisy_girl58,2007-09-19 06:00:00,116,"Latest update! The area we like to go to for salmon is east of Everett, the farmer said today that he has only seen one this past weekend...So I told him we live a ways from there and he said he would call as soon as they came in....Can't get much better than that! Go fishy's go!!!  Lorissa"
115351,lickmyarmpit,2007-09-19 15:41:00,359,"Iwent to check out some western tribs on the weekend no water=no fish.  Saw a few in the saugeen but not many, some of the other creeks are totally dried up we need rain badly.  What happens if we dont get it does anyone know? Do they stay in the lake or do they attempt to run a dried up river? "
