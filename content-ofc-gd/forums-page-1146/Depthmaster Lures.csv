115268,lew,2007-09-19 12:16:00,12767,Maybe give Brian a call at JB's Raf ?? ......He should have the info
115305,Raf,2007-09-19 14:11:00,3495,"Thanks Lew, no luck there, I just tried Brian."
115308,John,2007-09-19 14:16:00,2956,Seems like Depthmaster is used quite extensively as a brand name Raf. Cabela's and Scotty both use it.
115309,Raf,2007-09-19 14:17:00,3495," John, different Depthmaster.  Cabela's housebrand rods are called Depthmasters but not what I am looking for.  The folks I am interested in are local to southern ontario and build large muskie trolling lures."
115318,ccmtcanada,2007-09-19 14:44:00,7971,"Hey Raf...
