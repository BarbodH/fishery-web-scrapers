I just wish that I could catch something bigger than a Sunfish  So, to break in my new license I went out fishing last night after work 11pm-12:30am. The fish were there, I could see them with my flashlight and they were splashing and jumping like crazy. The only thing that I caught was a log under the water which resulted in a lost lure. A new one at that, just used it last night and after the third cast it snagged a log which I saw once I put the light on it.  The kids think my license is cool and we will be fishing all weekend. Mostly for panfish for them, as long as they are catching then I'm happy. But I need to catch something or else I'll go insane  Well I just thought that I would let you all know, Thanks Smokin"
