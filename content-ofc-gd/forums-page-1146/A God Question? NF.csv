115459,aplumma,2007-09-19 19:06:00,6896,Looks like it is time to enroll someone into Sunday school. For a child to ask that question you might want to ask him what has happened to make him ask that question. It could be just something he heard as a passing reference or he might be struggling with a concept that he is not old enough to comprehend that he heard from an adult conversation. Most 5 year olds do not know what the concept of infinity is or care for that matter.   Art

115490,Rizzo,2007-09-19 19:54:00,4754,"...always has been and always will be.  Unfortunately (for those who get troubled by such concepts as eternity), God did not feel it was necessary for humans to be given the understanding of how He can be eternal. At this point in time those who believe God is eternal have to chalk it up to faith.  The bible tells us God is without beginning or end, so we believe it.  In time (after death) it will all be made clear...so your child will have to wait for the real answer!  Concepts that are outside of human understanding can not only trouble children, but also their parents. As we age  and actually take the time to study the bible, some people will realize why we are on earth, and as ""created beings"" its not our ""right"" to know why everything happens. Basically, we are told what we need to know.  Those whose eyes aren't opened will remain very confused and will try to develop theories of how/why we are here."

These are all stories made up by bronze age sheep herders to explain away things they could not explain, and/or get control of people they wished to dominate or use.  Powerful people throughout history used these religious cults to their advantage ie. Romans, to control their populations.  It is still happening today, ie. Bush and the evangelicals, the Muslim fanatics etc...  Tell them the truth! Or at least tell them you don't know and let them decide when they are old enough and have ALL the information.  Indoctrinating children is a very BAD thing!"

He is pretty bright and usually understands that my 54 year old brain is fried at that time of the day. However, he came up with a blockbuster that I am sad to say I had no answer for. His question was......""If God created us, who created God""..... well, not panicking, I thought for a few seconds and once realizing that I was screwed, told him that I had some ""friends"" some of whom were more in touch with God than I was and I would ask them.  OK, here's a chance to save me from being embarrased by a 6 year old. All contributions will be taken under advisement......"

I did a quick search on google...type in ""who created God"" (with the quotation marks).  You'll get lots of returns....  Here's an excerpt from one....  IN SUMMARY The universe (including time itself) can be shown to have had a beginning.  It is unreasonable to believe something could begin to exist without a cause.  The universe therefore requires a cause, just as Genesis 1:1 and Romans 1:20 teach.  God, as creator of time, is outside of time. Since therefore He has no beginning in time, He has always existed, so doesn't need a cause.  Good luck explaining that....LOL."

115297,misfish,2007-09-19 13:52:00,29133,"Where did God come from?  We can only partially comprehend the notion of God's existence.  To do so, we must use human concepts to speak of God:  ""without beginning or end""; ""eternal""; ""infinite"", etc.   The Bible says that He has always existed:  "" . . . even from everlasting to everlasting, thou art God"" (Psalm 90:2).  And, ""Your throne is established from of old; Thou art from everlasting"" (Psalm 93:2).  Quite simply, God has no beginning and no end.  So, where did God come from?  He didn't.  He always was. To us, the notion of time is linear.  One second follows the next, one minute is after another.  We get older, not younger and we cannot repeat the minutes that have passed us by.  We have all seen the time lines on charts:   early time is on the left and later time is on the right.  We see nations, people's lives, and plans mapped out on straight lines from left to right.  We see a beginning and an end.  But God is ""beyond the chart.""  He has no beginning or end.  He simply has always been. Also, physics has shown that time is a property that is the result of the existence of matter.  Time exists when matter exists.  Time has even been called the fourth dimension.  But God is not matter.  In fact, God created matter.  He created the universe.  So, time began when God created the universe.  Before that, God was simply existing and time had no meaning (except conceptually), no relation to Him.  Therefore, to ask where God came from is to ask a question that cannot really be applied to God in the first place.  Because time has no meaning with God in relation to who He is, eternity is also not something that can be absolutely related to God.  God is even beyond eternity. Eternity is a term that we finite creatures use to express the concept of something that has no end -- and/or no beginning.  Since God has no beginning or end, He has no beginning.  This is because He is outside of time."

115396,yellowboat,2007-09-19 17:13:00,211," How a 747 flies  Bernoulli's Principle states that for an ideal fluid (low speed air is a good approximation), with no work being performed on the fluid, an increase in velocity occurs simultaneously with decrease in pressure or a change in the fluid's gravitational potential energy.  This principle is a simplification of Bernoulli's equation, which states that the sum of all forms of energy in a fluid flowing along an enclosed path (a streamline) is the same at any two points in that path. It is named after the Dutch/Swiss mathematician/scientist Daniel Bernoulli, though it was previously understood by Leonhard Euler and others. In fluid flow with no viscosity, and therefore, one in which a pressure difference is the only accelerating force, the principle is equivalent to Newton's laws of motion.  Bernoulli's Principle was often cited as the primary cause of lift in aircraft wings. While it has some effect, the simple description (eg. ""equal transit time or ""longer path"" theories) provided in many elementary textbooks is incorrect. [1]"
