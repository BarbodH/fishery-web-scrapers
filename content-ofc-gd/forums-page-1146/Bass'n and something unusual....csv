114913,Sherriff,2007-09-18 03:52:00,252,"Dropped off the kids and wanted to get the wife out for some of these night action largies.  Managed to get to a spot for 8:00pm and found if very tough to stay in a good position due to the winds.... It figures that the night I finally get her out the fishing sucks...  Anyways, only one fish caught tonight and it is my new PB largie.  Thought I had a big sheepie on until it did some spectacular tail walking and then took me under the boat again and again.  Great scrappy fish...    Any guess on weight?  We decided to come into the channel to get away from the wind but it was not much better.  Fished for a few minutes until I heard my wife freaking out because there were bats flying around and hitting our lines every cast.  Very cool I thought.  Then one hits the boat and gets stuck on the bumper line.  Wife is now losing her mind while this bats screams away.  Here is the pic    So I get this thing unhooked and it keeps shaking away and making noise.  After taking a closer look seems there are two bats and they are making SWEET LOVE!    The male was just chomping and chewing on the females scruff of her neck and pounding away like nobody's business.  That bat is the KING in my books now!  Was going for about 20 minutes straight full out!    Here is a video clip too.  http://s111.photobucket.com/albums/n160/Sh...nt=CIMG0765.flv  Decided to call it a night and as I am putting the boat on the trailer the male finished up and comes after me.  Almost hit me in the face about 5 times until I ran off the dock and the dangg thing takes after me into the parking lot.  Finally after the female took off the male left me alone so I could get the boat tied down and head home.  Was a fun night for sure..  Sherriff"

114921,ilario,2007-09-18 04:25:00,166,"weird!  they seem lighter in colour than the bats i've seen..or that the lighting? they also seem bigger   on a side note, anyone here bout the rabid bat that was brought in to an animal shelter? the woman who brought it in did not know it had rabies! the authorities asked her to come forward after the fact due to the possibility that she could've contracted the disease   creepy little buggers"
