115636,sunfish,2007-09-20 01:58:00,57,"I would just like to thank this this tread and everyones imput.  I was considering a Legend boat for bugetary reasons.  However, I have now reconsidered.  You are not only purchase a boat, you are also purchasing the service that comes along with it.  I would think, that the greatest margins are made in the servicing and not the sale. Similar to a car.  Great job with with the post.  If this post had not come about, there would be more unhappy customers.  "
115651,Badger Shark,2007-09-20 02:45:00,291,"I will never buy another Legend, I bought one two years ago and had nothing but problems, I am sure it was a ""Friday afternoon special "" .  When I contacted the dealer they in turn tried to get a hold of legend and they never did reply to them.  I sent an e-mail to the head of Legend and he only got back to me about a month after I had taken the boat back and bought an Alumacraft which is the best boat I have purchased and will only purchase in the future.  I only had the legend for 2 months and it cost me 2 grand but at least I have a better quality boat.  It is too bad because I wanted to support a Canadioan company.  You get what you pay for I guess, but thats no excuse for poor service or rude service."
115652,Another Canadian,2007-09-20 02:49:00,41,"  Smokercraft does supply the Riveted hulls, the all welded hulls are supplied by Monark marine.  I have a 1999 Smokercraft 178 Fazer (Legend considered it at the time a V188).  The centerline length is 17' 8"".   The gunwale length is 18' 8"".  Marketing"
114673,LeXXington,2007-09-17 15:51:00,1928,"Everyboat Manufactor has issues, Legend is no different.  I have had my Legend boat since 2004, there were a few minor design flaws and a few small issues that I chose to fix myself rather than leave it at the dealer for a month.  The one thing that Legend does offer is value,  Under powered is all in the eye of the driver.  For me and the dog, 25Hp is fine a 40(HP) would have been great but that would have been an over kill and gas hog for me (But NICE).  I am by no means a fan of bad service.. Bad service is bad service and you should always RANT and point it out. Here is a great area due to the many visitors and I hope the staff in Barrie reads this. I would not take my Legend back there for engin repairs due to this.  I just wanted to put out there that I like my Legend, and everything so far from Legend has been great. I would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a nice rig for a fair value.  If anything its made in CANADA well at last check anyway"
114710,davew3,2007-09-17 17:26:00,430,"Matt, you should send this post to the Legend head office in Sudbury.  I would think it would get the attention of someone up there,."
114902,JerseyDog,2007-09-18 03:05:00,190,"Here's one for the President and Marketing Manager at Legend.  As of right now, there has been 1,987 page views.  Imagine people on this site are prime boat buyers and sportsmen. The one's that read the post are probably actively interested in fishing boats. Imagine each has 8 sporting friends.  That's eight people each reader can directly influence who will then influence their family's, friends, coworkers, etc.  Imagine in the next five years, two of them buy a boat.  Almost every one of the 1,987 readers of this thread would say - buy a Lund / buy anything else / forget the Legend  Thats 3,974 lost sales. At $15k average, that's $59.6 million in lost sales.  And thats 3,974 owners of other boats that willl go on to tell everyone how much they like thier new non-Legend purchase - for even more lost sales.  All the ads in Ontario Outdoors can't sell $60million in boats as fast as one post on OFC can make those sales go up in smoke.  Bad service is stupid on Legend's part and someone should be fired."
114910,John Bacon,2007-09-18 03:39:00,3277,  My understanding is that the hulls are made in the USA by SmokerCraft and only the trim is added in Canada.  If buying Canadian is a priority then I would suggest MistyRiver.  PrinceCraft is also made in Canada but they are American owned.
113793,mattyk,2007-09-14 14:19:00,2110,i have added an update by editing my first post about a discussion that i had with the manager of legend boats.
113795,ccmtcanada,2007-09-14 14:31:00,7971," Oh man....sounded like he off-handedly threatened you ""better think twice before badmouthing""."
113797,Guest mistyriver1,2007-09-14 14:37:00,0,Read your update Matt.  That's too bad.  Sounds like the manager may be thinking he won a battle but in the long run if this is how they treat their customers he'll lose the war.
