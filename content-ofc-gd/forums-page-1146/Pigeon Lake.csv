113529,Beans,2007-09-13 22:14:00,3339,I will probably be one bay (Tait's Bay) over (east) from Nogies on Friday and Saturday...going to be a bit windy according to the forecast so I am a bit limited from venturing too far with a 14 ft tinnie with only a 4 HP Mercury...  Look for this old fart if you get over this way...   Saturday night Maribeth and I  have a bit of a social affair to attend over at the Buckhorn Community Hall so won't be able to join you guys as far as I know...
114503,Loonietoon,2007-09-17 01:07:00,1450,"Well I finally arrived at Pigeon Lake Resort with boat trailer on the back of a flat bed tow truck at 10.00 pm.  Came up County Rd 10 to meet 17 and the right rear wheel fell off thus coming to a halt real fast  . Up on examination I discovered that the weld had broke from the axle to the wheel hub  , lucky I was not going to fast when this happened ( axle was new just over a year ago) Thursday morning went over to check thing out and made a few calls, found a guy in Lindsay that would have a look at the axle but no guarantees that he could fix it.. Up on examination he found out that he could reweld the axle with no problem for a tune of $20.00. Gave the guy $30.00 with a battle as he said thats all he wanted and I told him it was worth more. Back to the Resort I go and install the axle then put the boat in the water. Fished Friday before the storm NADA... Fished Saturday a few perch.. Went in to meet the guys @ Pub 32 NADA..Arrived at 8.55 pm left @ 9.30 pm. Went back to Pigeon Lake Resort had a few beers went to bed... On the way home today the right wheel hub was a lot warmer than it should be so I put in more grease  ( I don't  think we packed enough in) Made it back to Hamilton axle still to warm for me.. Might have the bearings a little to tight, will check this week...Great seeing you again Beans  Might come up again soon and fish with you in my boat... Thats all for this trip"
114548,Nanook,2007-09-17 03:32:00,565," Shee-it ! I gotta get on this ""puter more. Sorry to miss you Kelvin, did'nt see this thread earlier."
114739,bigbuck,2007-09-17 18:44:00,2449,"Jeez!!! If I only knew, I was at Pigeon Hollow on Saturday at a buddies trailer for some fishing and a pig roast. Needless to say there wasn't too much fishing done but the little porker was fantastic."
114872,Loonietoon,2007-09-18 01:29:00,1450,Nanook.. Beans dropped over for a while and he thought you might have been around... just PMed him and said I think I might be back up after Thanksgiving.. will let you know.   bigbuck.. I know what you were saying about the weather.. it was a might tad cold for this time of year.. we ended up with a fish fry on Saturday and like I said I was suppose to meet up with a few others at pub 32 but they never showed so I went back to camp and had a few brown pops
114888,Pigeontroller,2007-09-18 02:12:00,2793,"Kelvin, i didn't get any responses about meeting at Pub32 so I assumed knowone was going...Sorry. I keep my eye open for your boat but didn't see it..."
115201,Loonietoon,2007-09-19 01:16:00,1450,"Dax I sent you a PM with my cell # to call me when you arrived at Pigeon,, maybe you didn't get it... Boat was sitting at the dock Friday afternoon as the winds were getting up before the storm that rolled thru. Saturday was out by Noogies Creek.. Drifted down from the 2 Islands down past the Marine and over towards the creek entrance  then back and forth before the black clouds came in across Hurricane Point area.. Went back to camp for the fish fry. Went in to town at 8.55pm then left around 9.30pm.."
115208,007,2007-09-19 01:26:00,537,Hey Loonietoon.  Sorry I missed you at Pigeon Lake resort.  We arrived later on Saturday than expected.  When I took the rental boat out on Sunday morning I noticed your Chevy van pulling out.  Sorry to hear about your troubles.  Weather was pretty cool on Sunday too out on the water but had an enjoyable time.  I will post a fishing report in the next few days - a couple of firsts for me but nothing huge and didn't bother targetting muskies in the end.  007
115212,Loonietoon,2007-09-19 01:37:00,1450,007.. I talked to Wayne the owner he said you were there then I lost track of what I was doing with the problems I had ... May be next time
