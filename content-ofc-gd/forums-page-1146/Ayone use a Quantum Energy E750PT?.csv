115155,evster,2007-09-18 23:10:00,367,Has anyone used these?  I found someone selling one that they haven't used for a pretty good price.  Opinions?
115211,Guest Johnny Bass,2007-09-19 01:36:00,0, Is it the purple one? I bought a Quantum Energy E5 or something like that was not used much for $50. Its an older model but has been good to me. I would Imagine the newer models being better.  If its in mint condition and cheap? I would say go for it.
115213,Guest Johnny Bass,2007-09-19 01:43:00,0,Checked it out. It looks like a decent reel but has a low gear ratio. 5.1:1. Depends on what you are using it for. Probably good for crank baits and spinner baits
115227,evster,2007-09-19 03:17:00,367,"Ya, its mint condition for 100 bucks.  Does the slower gear ration mean its going to retrieve slower?  The one I have now is 6.3:1.  I was hoping to use it for jigs and anything else I see fit.  I'm still new with baitcasters so I have no idea what is good for what.  So far I have been happy with my 6.3:1 reel for jigs and spinnerbaits and buzzbaits.  I think it might be hard to burn a spinnerbait with the slower reel, but should it not work ok for jigs?"

115259,evster,2007-09-19 11:25:00,367,If you can find me one for $60 US i'll take it!  Everywhere I looks has them for $190 US.
115263,Guest Johnny Bass,2007-09-19 11:33:00,0,"  Yes it means it retrieves very slow. My Quantum Energy is also 6.3:1. Slow retrieve is good in cold water, like cold fronts, spring and fall. I'm not sure if I would use it for jigs though. I personally cant cast a jig far with my baitcaster, but then again, its old and beat up now. I also wouldn't use it for tube jigging, worming or flipnjigging. I prefer a faster gear ratio for that, so I can reel in that excess line in a hurry when I get a pick up."
115266,misfish,2007-09-19 11:58:00,29133,"  DOH,Looking at wrong reel.LOL Told ya it was a tough morning."
