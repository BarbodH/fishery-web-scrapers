114620,Mike the Pike,2007-09-17 13:42:00,3421,Roy was that you  MTP
114624,Roy,2007-09-17 13:46:00,13728,Certainly wasn't me  but I think that one of our board members caught a huge one.
114629,Guest gbfisher,2007-09-17 13:55:00,0,"That would be a great thing!!!!.........if it is true...  From what I have seen in the past of ""big fish stories"" I wouldn't  hold my breath...  Length, Girth and pictures don't tell the truth. Credible witnesses and good scales do.  Witnesses can over look things in the right situation and scales can be wrong....lol  Better to just know you caught it and keep it to yourself....."
114634,Terry,2007-09-17 14:02:00,14456,"if you want a big fish to make it into the record books these days you need to kill the fish send it to 40 different groups to weight measure, do DNA testing plus 3 lie detector tests ( on the fish not you), Your lie detector test will come later you also need to be fishing with at lest one policeman, a judge and the pope or they will question whether or not it qualifies as a record  but that would be a nice fish to catch"
114635,ccmtcanada,2007-09-17 14:04:00,7971, Cool!  I'm fishing with all of them in a few weeks...I'll probably get skunked.
114646,Roy,2007-09-17 14:43:00,13728,"Good stuff, Cliff. You'll be able to be charged, convicted and pardoned all in the same outing."
114648,ccmtcanada,2007-09-17 14:47:00,7971, LOL....that was great Roy....
114785,Guest Johnny Bass,2007-09-17 21:24:00,0,That was funny Roy!
114850,Crazyhook,2007-09-18 00:42:00,1154,"OK that was funny!!  :)  hope its true... and I would believe it, some really long fish in the Larry"
114946,saumon,2007-09-18 10:17:00,5,...c'mon! give us a clue Roy. Wich portion of the Larry? 1000 islands or Quebec? Maybe a giant but 63 is a lot of fish. It was between O'Brien (65) and Williamson (61)...  Hope we'll see some pics!
114948,Marc Thorpe,2007-09-18 10:39:00,621,"My only question is that 63 lbs,does that count as 1 or 2 muskies what would 3 make 111 pounds mmmmm I smell fish fry Served with Frapatino Latte of course"
114990,graftongal,2007-09-18 13:53:00,145,And a mochachino cafe half frap for Adam!
