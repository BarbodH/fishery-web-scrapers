115234,Ron,2007-09-19 04:08:00,1683,"I agree to the wash/inspection stations as well, but this shouldn't fall on the Provincial Ministry of Natural Resources. This should fall on the Federal Government. After all, they are the ones who are allowing the invasive species to enter in the first place.  If the Federal Government would control the ballast water on the vessels entering the St. Lawrence, we wouldn't have invasive species to begin with."
115256,lunkerbasshunter,2007-09-19 11:01:00,2585,"any lake that is contaimanted should be washed down, not just the lakes in the south.  are people really going to take the time to do it?  i doubt it.  There have been invasive species in lakes from the begining of time. (birds, small animals can bring eggs from lake to lake) Lakes change and adapt.  Unfortunetly i think we may just have to learn to live with it.  Cheers!"
115265,OhioFisherman,2007-09-19 11:56:00,6623,"LOL, slam the fishermen and boaters? What about the shipping companies that brought in things like gobies and zebra mussels? Shouldn`t they be required to pay the costs of clearing our waters of them? Yes it is important to stop or prevent the spread of invasive species, but business gets a pass at taxpayer expense?  Just my opinion that a little more care in what is allowed to enter our countries in the first place would be cheaper than trying to clean up the mess afterwards. Take a look at the damage caused by the emerald ash borer, lose a species of tree to cheap imports? and who gets stuck with the bill? Do you take firewood to your cabin or campsite? Is it safe? Is it your fault?  No easy answer, but money talks and we pay."
115303,bigbuck,2007-09-19 14:07:00,2449,"Spend the money on the elimination/control of the invasive species. At this rate, pretty much every northern fishing lodge will go out of business because it's too expensive for our American friends to come up now with the loonie approaching parity with the greenback."
115044,TJQ,2007-09-18 15:59:00,7806,I received this today..   I think its worth a discussion here.... what do you think?? 
115048,tonyb,2007-09-18 16:11:00,1637,"Makes sense, but completely unrealistic.  Imagine the wait times on any given weekend in the summer, the goal is to attract visitors, not deter them.  I think disinfection should be handled when exiting the ramps from infected lakes.  The Government should be responsible for the costs of these disinfection stations, after all it is their blatant disregard for the health of the Great Lakes watershed that has got us to this point.  Gold Bar$ vs. The Whole planet..... (If you've seen 'An Inconvenient Truth' you'll understand what I mean)  Tony"
115054,Roy,2007-09-18 16:33:00,13728,Tony is right. Completely unrealistic. We have those wash stations here for a few lakes. Ten bucks for a light rinse in cold water for the hull only. Just brilliant.
115059,wallyboss,2007-09-18 16:52:00,1095,Roy $10.00 those are the cheap ones.  I've read on QP that at some lakes the launch are 40 to 50 and so is the wash  so it cost about 100 to be able to put your boat in the water but locals can take there boats out of the lakes go somewhere for the day and then come back and because they are locals they are exempt from this.
115060,ccmtcanada,2007-09-18 16:55:00,7971,"I dont own a boat, but I see one in my future.  I'd probably be hesitant to take it up there if I knew I'd have to wait to have it inspected.  I have enough lines I have to get in living in the GTA....that's another one I dont need...especially since it takes me 4 hours just get that far north."
115078,graftongal,2007-09-18 17:57:00,145,"One inspection station is going to solve the invasive species problems in the north?   Brilliant.  The letter first states how the Ministry doesn't have enough money to put gas in C/O's trucks, but they want to spend more money to create and man an inspection station. I wish them luck with that."
115080,TennesseeGuy,2007-09-18 18:01:00,957,At this rate you'll soon be requiring fishermen from Alabama and Tennessee to take a bath before entering Ontario.
115082,douG,2007-09-18 18:03:00,2693,"Not such a bad idea, really, when you think about it for a minute."
115083,Roy,2007-09-18 18:05:00,13728,No Connie. Just the Alabananians
115084,Guest mistyriver1,2007-09-18 18:06:00,0,They better make sure they use....  
115087,Greencoachdog,2007-09-18 18:16:00,8163,  May the nocturnal discharge of a million Fire Ants fester upon your bed pillow for a fortnight.
115093,Tacklebuster,2007-09-18 18:37:00,303,"Totally unrealistic.   If business operators that rely on tourism are crying the blues now,  I can't imagine what they will be saying if something like this gets implemented.  After driving 4 hours hauling my boat, the last thing I want to do is stand in line for another hour to get my boat inspected.  With the vast number of places to go fishing, I am sure people will avoid going to places where they will have to pull off the highway to get their boat inspected, I know I would.  In the end, its only going to prolong the inevitable spread of some of these invasive species.  The spread of some of these species don't even rely on human movement, they can easily be spread by birds.  I don't have a better idea, but I sure don't think that one will work."
115096,vance,2007-09-18 18:47:00,719,Even if the wash station was implemented and most LAW ABIDING boaters used it there would still be the 10-20% that would use the back roads to go around it to save themselves from having to get it done thus negating any benefit .I travel to the Pickeral river many times thru the year and I have yet to find anywhere something that will kill all the things that I could be bringing with me. If I am using my boat down south all the drains and intakes are plugged when in the water and I NEVER take it out the week before I head north.I don't see how you can completely wash your boat when it's on the trailer even though I try.   vance
115105,LeXXington,2007-09-18 19:24:00,1928,"Never going to happen, This would also incure, other types of transport not just fishing boats, kayaks, jet skies, speed boats etc.  Now lakes with no public access..  I can see some ramp fee's going up with the idea of saving the water  Do this and the northern communities will lose more business. I would just stick too the great lakes or waterways already with Gobies ets.."
115107,John,2007-09-18 19:45:00,2956,"Seems to me that the spirit may be sound but the execution impractical.  What about water ski's, tubes, boat anchors, trolling motors, footwear, drift socks,  down riggers, planer boards, fishing line (particularly braid), bilges, water still in outboard cooling systems, landing nets...............and on, and on....  Wouldn't most of the above stand a pretty good chance of being contaminated, even more so than the hull of a boat?"
115109,bbog,2007-09-18 19:49:00,665,The OFAH does some great work but this idea is ludicrous! Are we to believe a) the only lakes worth saving is N of North Bay and b ) all the problems originate in lakes S of North Bay? The answer to both these questions is OF COURSE NOT.  Not exactly a fully baked solution to a very comprehensive issue.
115132,misfish,2007-09-18 21:11:00,29133, What he said.
115136,Mike the Pike,2007-09-18 21:29:00,3421," Roy I know of the Lakes here in Quebec that do so.The price is $20 ,10 for the wash and 10 for parking.After 40 to 50 dollars in gas  towing the boat some 300kms there and back  $15 for boat fuel  for the day the 20 dollars is a rip off yes they use soap but the water is cold .Oh and yes the line ups are a pain in the a s s  .Not to mention they open at 6am only.I have waited as long as 45 minutes.why not leave the equipment on shore and just let us fisherman wash the boat.Cash grab if you ask me.  MTP"
115159,John Bacon,2007-09-18 23:39:00,3277, Making people from southern Ontario wash their boats; or making people from Alabama and Tennessee take a bath?
115187,HTHM,2007-09-19 00:36:00,4082,"I would say that this issue is the same as animal husbandry, chicken farmers do not allow you into their barn if you have been in another chicken barn that day. As well, when I was working in horticulture, any diseased samples were brought into the nursery sealed in plastic bags, to PREVENT the spread of disease. Should we not execute the same husbandry with this resourse? Just my two cents"
115188,Roy,2007-09-19 00:38:00,13728, Washing our boats would ENSURE that our resource remains uncontaminated?
115195,Whopper,2007-09-19 00:54:00,2174," I concur Roy, what's next washing the birds too!"
115214,Marc Thorpe,2007-09-19 01:45:00,621,  woooooooooooooooooooooo Now thast nasty
115224,Greencoachdog,2007-09-19 02:48:00,8163,I believe it should be the fishermans moral responsibility to wash all of his own equipment after fishing contaminated waters if he is going to fish an uncontaminated water.  Get a big sponge and a bucket of soapy water ya lazy S.O.B!
115233,carll2,2007-09-19 03:41:00,443," my fishing partner has seen 35 bucks in the mont tremblant region, its rediculous its all ready enough.. permits,, lures,gas,insurance practically cost an arm and leg"
