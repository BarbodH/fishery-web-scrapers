He was trying to reel this big fish in way too fast.I kept telling him to slow down and let the fish tire out.He didn't listen and sure enough,SNAP! He got all upset and said sorry for losing the fish.I told him I didn't care if he lost the fish but in the future to listen to advice.We will put that under lesson learned.Next up was Ethan who kept saying he didn't want a big fish,lol.I had a hit and handed him the rod.He reeled in this bass on his own.  If it looks like he is backing away from the fish it is because he was.Every time I tried to get it near him for a pic he would freak out saying it would smack him like my sucker did a little while back.Oh, well. As for dad.I caught a couple,nothing big.    The carp fishing was pretty slow tonight but these little bass would not stop stealing our bait.It got dark so we packed up and went home.There is always next time."

114915,Mike the Pike,2007-09-18 04:09:00,3421,The addiction is growing nice to have a fishing hole 5 minutes from home.Hey man we need to see more hand held pics of the fish the hanging shots don't give a us a fish eye view.   MTP
114979,pikehunter,2007-09-18 13:16:00,1659,So typical! Go carp fishing and catch bass! Go bass fishing and get carp! Go figure?  Looks like another perfect outing with the family
