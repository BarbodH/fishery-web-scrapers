115203,Guest Johnny Bass,2007-09-19 01:22:00,0,LOL. I read that and found that very amusing. They sue in America for anything. They say there are more Lawyers in the USA than all lawyers in the world put together. Many of them are ambulance chasers though.

115512,fishermccann,2007-09-19 20:17:00,655,how can you sue something that does not exist
115528,ecxstriper,2007-09-19 21:18:00,343,Well the guy who filed the suit is a Nebraska State Senator. He filed the suit to prove a point about frivilous law suits.  And Shawn I don't know if a billion dollars would cover it.
