Bertha is 3.25 lbs and Bob is 2.5 lbs... they have since been released to a farmers pond with other LM's. Did you know that LM's cannot digest shiners, and regurgutate most of the fur when they eat a mouse or mole...they were in my tank for about 3 years.... it took alot of cleaning."
114415,Muskieman,2007-09-16 17:43:00,2472,Where the hell is my video!!!   sorry guys  I'l try to convert them into pictures.. I guess we can't post a video.. 
114428,Tinman,2007-09-16 19:16:00,376,look forward to it!
114477,Rizzo,2007-09-17 00:02:00,4754,I'd love to have a pet bass in a tank! Closest I've come is creating a bass habitat under my dock (chucked in some big rocks). Love to watch the bass swim around on my aquaview...hate to watch someone cast at my dock to catch one of my boys!
114490,mcallister.grant,2007-09-17 00:38:00,327,Where's the pics? I'd love to see them..
114492,frozen-fire,2007-09-17 00:41:00,542,how big of a tank did you have them in?
114502,Muskieman,2007-09-17 01:07:00,2472,"60 gallon tank, with a gravel bottom and a few big rocks for cover. They'd eat 3 dozen red dace a week and on the weekend they'd each get a mouse.  I don't have a program that can pause and isolate a frame to make a picture of it... kinda tough,,"
114522,BFSC Kevin,2007-09-17 02:10:00,1351,can you just do print screen?
114523,Golfisher,2007-09-17 02:11:00,586,"You could post your video on youtube and link it from here.  And next time I'm out bassin', I'm hitting rizzo's dock."
114577,Burtess,2007-09-17 11:26:00,901,"   Glad you got them out of there and into a pond.  I have a 10"" midas cichlid alone in a 75gal and I do 50% water changes per week to keep the nitrates under 20ppm.  Were you dumping half the water per day?  Thats alot of bio-load for that size tank...  Burt"
114835,Muskieman,2007-09-18 00:09:00,2472,50% of the water per day !!?//   I changed the water{straight from the tap}  about 6 times in three years.. I had a cheap little filter and  changed the filters in it 2x a month washed the windows 2x a week and that's it!! tough as nails ..
114838,Burtess,2007-09-18 00:18:00,901, OMG... you just put all the hard core aquarium keepers into the fetal position lol......  Burt
114855,Rizzo,2007-09-18 00:48:00,4754," hahaha golfisher, I'll be keeping my eyes open for you.  If you want double headers of 5 pounders (one smallie, one bucketmouth) they are there for the taking.  Couple of 2-3 pounders come around regularly too.  I have too much fun watching them on the camera to even try and catch them (who am I kidding...I catch them a couple times a summer)"
114867,Muskieman,2007-09-18 01:14:00,2472,I hpoe this worked and is'nt too grainy..
