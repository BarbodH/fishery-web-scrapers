114724,Vanselena,2007-09-17 17:56:00,269,"I've been using Big Jon downriggers for 20 years now and I think I am finally tired of repairing them. I've had the following repairs; on the electrics primarily the motors go and am tired of the $132 bill. On manuals have changed clutches, bearings, and most recently had a downrigger arm snap. When looking at other rigger companies I see some offer lifetime warranties while others like Big Jon don't offer much except headaches. Didn't mind the headaches when I was younger but think age is starting to catch up.  Any Suggestions are appreciated, will be selling my 5 Big Jon's this  winter and buying a new setup."
114726,PERCHER,2007-09-17 18:03:00,787,Look at the Scotty line.I have them in manuals on my boat and my brother has them in electric on his.We both have not had a single problem.I would recomend them highly.
114727,ecmilley,2007-09-17 18:05:00,2163,i have used walkers and scotty and still prefer big johns once you change for awhile you'll probly be comingback to the big johns
114731,Tacklebuster,2007-09-17 18:17:00,303,"I still have my electric Big Jons, which are now about 25 yrs old.  Never had a motor problem, the only thing I had to do was replace the plastic housing for the switch.  I even still have the spring coil rod holders.  I never had an opportunity to try any others, and if I ever decide to replace them for no apparent reason, I will probably buy Big Jons again."
114740,Fishmaster,2007-09-17 18:46:00,920,Scotty Down Riggers all the way ..i have had them all Scotty Kicks Butt
114744,POLLIWOGG,2007-09-17 19:04:00,835,I like my scotties.
114746,tonyb,2007-09-17 19:08:00,1637,"Any of the new electrics, Walker, Cannon, Scotty, Vector, etc are going to work well."
114757,HookNrelease,2007-09-17 19:36:00,85,"I too have run big jon electrics for the past 10 years without any problems,,,, I do have a motor that is starting to slow and creep a bit however that was due to running a 15# ball last year, if you stick to 10# balls they should be fine, Its like everything else some people have some bad luck even with scotties, walkers, cannons etc, to each there own i guess, good luck either way you go. cheers  ian"
114758,Uncle Buck,2007-09-17 19:39:00,1000,"I have Walker Electrics...  problem is you can't get the best out of each...  Pros: Walker is nice cause they are small and look good Big Jons have awesome rod holders, you can also use the rodholder for a dipsy, tip up Scottys I like the layout, lever for lowering down the ball, tip up Cons: Walker don't like the toggle switch for the down, rod holders, no tip up Big Jons, look like crap, a piece of plastic would have went  along way esthetically Scottys, i don't like the rod holdersmind you i've never had any problems with my walkers,  This year, i spent time on a lot of boats, each boat had different riggers... i'd probably go with Scottys if i had to do it again..."
114764,Fang,2007-09-17 20:04:00,1330,I've had my Cannon M-10's for over 20 years and given them more than a work out. Only things I've done to the 2 I own  each has had a new end roller and new drag washers on clutch. One 1 unit I replaced a breaker switch  Total over 15 years probably less than $50.  I bought mine on recommendations I got directly from the charter captains in dock J-L at Port Credit YC back in the hey day of the derby. At that time it was Big Jon and Walker mostly.

114843,addict,2007-09-18 00:24:00,475,try bass fishing and wait for salmon to come to u in the fall.
114852,live2fish,2007-09-18 00:44:00,70,Scottys all the way. Mine have never had a problem and there the fastest ive seen. And they have a lifetime warranty. What ever you break they replace. They also have awesome customer service.  try bass fishing and wait for salmon to come to u in the fall.  some guys like fish peeling off 500 feet at a time  Bowen
114865,DT10Sam,2007-09-18 01:08:00,480,"If anyone is interested in Scotty's I will be clearing some out.  I have 3 electrics left and I would have to check on the models tomorrow morning when I get in to work and I will be at least reducing them to cost.  If anyone interested send me a PM.  Regards, Sam"
114926,ilario,2007-09-18 04:35:00,166,"for the scotty manual owners out there, what is the retrieval rate like? faster than the competitors?  thanks!"
114950,Randy,2007-09-18 11:12:00,115,Scottys  
114987,PERCHER,2007-09-18 13:47:00,787,Scotty retrieval is 2ft per crank with handles out or 1ft per crank handles in.
114996,LeXXington,2007-09-18 14:06:00,1928,"I have had both types of manuels, Scotty and Walker  Given a choice I would pick Scotty."
115031,fishindevil,2007-09-18 15:23:00,6254,"I have had big-jons for 20 yrs ...and not a single problem,i have only had to replace springs ,which go to the line counter,and thats just normal wear & tear,i would own them again in a second,on the big jon speed riggers you can control the speed in which they go up & down and they can go faster that any other brand out there...i guess its just personal preferance"
115158,ilario,2007-09-18 23:34:00,166,  what?? handles in/out?
115181,PERCHER,2007-09-19 00:26:00,787,On Scotty manual riggers the crank handle on the rigger pulls out to increase the speed of retrieval by 2x.The handle pushes back in when lowering the ball.Look close at the picture on this link. http://www.scotty.com/marine/products/prod...anual/1080.html
115185,fishdawg,2007-09-19 00:33:00,912," no comment  I have owned & used a variety of different riggers   manuals & electrics, both my own & friends  when the day comes that I upgrade to electrics, I am pretty certain they will be Big Jon Capatains packs"
115215,walleyejigger,2007-09-19 01:46:00,876,"have had 2 electric cannons for over 10 years, only use a few times a year but never had a problem"
