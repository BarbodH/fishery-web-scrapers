305222,GeorgeJ,2009-02-12 01:35:00,207,"Yeah good episode, my Grandfather use to catch gar with a huge square net at the end of a big long tree branch pivoting on another branch with a Y at the end of it to allow the pivoting action. I'm pretty sure he ate them, he wasn't into catch and release type fishing, more into putting food on the table kind of guy."
305227,BUSTER,2009-02-12 01:41:00,1336,lol funny i just seen it also.
305242,Greencoachdog,2009-02-12 02:04:00,8163," Ok, those are kinda wimpy compared to the ones we have in Alabama.  http://www.ag.auburn.edu/aaes/communicatio...er00/elise.html"
305244,fishing n autograph,2009-02-12 02:06:00,2540,Great episode. I read about it in Canadian Fly Fisher. I guess he lost a bet and that's why he did it....it was great though
305245,Spiel,2009-02-12 02:06:00,9065,"  I hear ya Glen, loud and clear."
305251,purekgw,2009-02-12 02:16:00,585,GCD i would be afraid of that eating me
305290,rbaquial,2009-02-12 04:25:00,968," LOL!!!! Yeah, that was a freakin' hilarious episode!!  I love watchin' that guy fish.... he's hilarious!!"
305310,Stern Rules,2009-02-12 06:36:00,342,That alligator gar was huge.
305375,The Urban Fisherman,2009-02-12 14:37:00,2050," Hey Dawg -  Episode 1 was a Gator Gar show!  Those things are NUTS.  I can't remember the numbers off hand, but Dave slammed them that day... They're unreal fish, I'm definitely going back for them someday.  As for last nights show - I was wondering if anybody would chime in about it.  What a fun shoot to!  To bad the weather chased the crew off the lake.  I was trying to film lighting and Dave goes ""Put the dang camera away, we're gettin' off the water""! lol  Nick know's his stuff, and Dave had an absolute blast hammering those gar on a fly rod!  I can't believe more people don't fish them.  Cheers, UF"
306031,Markystang,2009-02-13 19:10:00,131,"I thought it was pretty cool. I don't know of many anglers that specifically target Gar, let alone with a flyrod. Atta boy, Dave! Awesome to watch!"
306046,Ramble,2009-02-13 19:34:00,713,I know someone who guides for them on the fly! Quite the experiance from what i Understand.  -Dave
306756,nancur373,2009-02-15 19:35:00,1211,What lakw was that?
306817,Joeytier,2009-02-15 23:25:00,3990,I'm guessing it was in the trent system somewhere.  Perhaps Quinte.
