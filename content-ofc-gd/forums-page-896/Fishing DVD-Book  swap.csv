Just borrow , watch and then return. We could even do the book swap thing as well. I have a ton of books on every type of fishing known. Just need to find them. I would say that a 1-2 week time period would be good. Let me know what you guys think."

306165,GBW,2009-02-14 00:30:00,8460,I would be into this BUT I don't have any DVD's or book to loan out...
