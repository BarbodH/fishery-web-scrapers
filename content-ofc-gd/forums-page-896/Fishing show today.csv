Early rise and an 8am start for the spectacular bass seminar with Gord Pyzer, Big Jim and gang...wow talk about information  After the seminar we wandered through everything but only made a few small purchases.  Like everyone else has said no real deals.  Seems the price of rods has gone up.  1pm came along very quickly and we showed up at Mercers booth.  Looked around and didn't recognize anyone other than Dave Mercer himself who was very busy with a long line up of people looking for autographs.  Then I spotted Cliff CCMT and Bly along with TJ and Monique.  Shortly after everyone else wandered over:  FishinDevil, Buster, Nautifish and JohnF.  Wonderful to meet everyone else in person  TJ, I thought that was real nifty standing on your tip toes while having your picture taken next to Nautifish  So after some good conversation it was time to finish wandering off through the show and call it day."
