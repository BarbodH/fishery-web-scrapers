306154,mbac31,2009-02-14 00:19:00,904,Before I order this rod I was wondering if someone here had a gently used one or a new one they are not using. I have a few GLX loomis rods for trade (Bass) I have a couple of newer GLX rods that have never been used including the Crankbait one. . Or will buy outright.  http://products.gloomis.com/gl/products/fl...D=1234570192580
