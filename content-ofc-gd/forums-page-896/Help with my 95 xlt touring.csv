The problem I'm having is she won't fire up using the electric start.  It turns over...battery is full but won't fire!  Crazy thing is every time I try cranking it with the key and it doesn't start, It'll fire within two pulls of the chord!???  Any ideas?  I already had someone suggest I change the ignition switch (which I did) but it didn't work!  Help!  It's not that big a deal, but I'd like the wife to be able to start it.    I appreciate your comments.   Thanks."
305909,ctdd2006,2009-02-13 13:24:00,531,bump.   Anyone?
305912,2 tone z71,2009-02-13 13:32:00,1311,"hmmm is it turning over slow sluggish like ,or is it whirling it over pretty quick ,if its cranking it to slow it wont start,either your batterys getting weak or your starters gonna need some attention"
305925,ecmilley,2009-02-13 13:54:00,2163,"put a spark tester on it while it's cranking on the starter, almost sounds like the ignition is grounding out when cranking over"
305967,OhioFisherman,2009-02-13 15:58:00,6623,"That is a sled? No experience with them, but if it will pull start easily but won`t key start I might look at the electric connections, wiring to the distributor from the key or starter? Key has to be in on position to start it? No safety mechanism in the seat to shut it down if the rider is thrown? Guess not if you have to get off to pull start?"
306008,ctdd2006,2009-02-13 17:44:00,531,my charger reads that the battery is full.  I'll try with a new battery.  Mine is a couple of years old.  Thanks for all the advice so far.
306012,JohnF,2009-02-13 18:20:00,3494," Go back to ECMilley's comment. Is there spark when it's spinning over on the starter? It can be going round and round to beat the band, but if there's no spark due to some malfunction in the wiring, specifically the ignition switch, it ain't gonna start no how.  JF"
306019,douG,2009-02-13 18:49:00,2693,"If it is spinning over, there is nothing wrong with your battery.  You need spark and fuel to start the engine, and if it starts with the pull cord, you got fuel.  Back to ecmilley's comment.  Look for something wrong with the spark during the cranking."
306020,Dondorfish,2009-02-13 18:54:00,1000,Same thing happened to Skeeters skidoo - it turned out to be a gap in the stator coil - got that fixed and good to go ( till he blew the motor )  Don  
306022,Big Cliff,2009-02-13 18:55:00,6899,"My money is with  ecmilley on this one, there is a wireing problem. Did this just start out of the blue or have you added anything into the circuit? Could be a broken wire or short but I'll bet you have no spark when trying to start it with the starter!"
306059,ctdd2006,2009-02-13 20:02:00,531,Makes sense.  I'll try that tonight.  Thanks everyone!
306168,limeyangler,2009-02-14 00:34:00,5204,Ive got exactly the same machine...my electric start works...but i'm mechanically challenged so i will be watching this post with interest....thanks for posting cctd
306223,ctdd2006,2009-02-14 03:06:00,531,I hope it isn't the stator.  Unfortunate thing is I changed that last year too!  I may leave it alone as the sled is running as good as ever and I hate messing with it now.  Problably going to be a summer project to avoid down time!
306247,2 tone z71,2009-02-14 04:25:00,1311,"battery reading 11-12 V dont mean crap ,if ya got a load tester thats a different story"
