305923,HTHM,2009-02-13 13:54:00,4082,"My sympathies to anyone affected by this tragedy. Seeing how it was a local flight, I hope no-one from the board was affected."
305957,irishfield,2009-02-13 15:27:00,26272,Another terrible day in aviation history Albert.
305959,smokin joe,2009-02-13 15:35:00,226,"We were instructed this morning to be ready to drop everything and get to the site at a moments notice.  I agree, another tragedy and my condolences go out to everyone affected by it."
305965,OhioFisherman,2009-02-13 15:49:00,6623,"Hearts go out to the people affected, a tragedy for sure!"
305968,snoil,2009-02-13 15:59:00,139,A widow of one of the 911 crashes was killed in the buffalo crash.Very sad indeed.
305977,Marko,2009-02-13 16:30:00,854,Not a day goes by that you don't see on TV something awful happening. My hearts go out to family members and friends  of those who have died in this crash
305998,blaque,2009-02-13 17:02:00,2419,"It was a somber ride into work this morning, as i drive right by clarence center road (just west of the crash site) I live just 5 miles from where the plane went down and its really just a shame........the only blessing is that more people on the ground werent hurt. I watch these planes go over my backyard in a constant fashion and have always worried about something like this........it is now a reality. A very saddening reality. Im very anxious to hear what it was that caused this plane to go down, they were descending and just minutes away from the runway......if not less. So sad.......this one really hits home."
306009,John,2009-02-13 17:51:00,2956,"I fly in and out BUF three or 4 times a month, sometimes on a Dash 8, considering the amount in service they appear to be a pretty safe aircraft. From any reports that I have heard could ice build up?  Definitely a tragedy. Heart felt condolences to all involved."
306024,blaque,2009-02-13 18:57:00,2419,"they said that pilots coming into buffalo last night were mentioning ice build up. I dunno,"
306050,tipupesox,2009-02-13 19:45:00,167,"Have to agree with you Blaque, it is a very humbling experience when a tragedy like this happens in your community.  I had a friend that was scheduled to be on that flight but due to delays he decieded to spend the night in NYC.  I guess it was his lucky day.  Thoughts and prayers to the families invovled."
306063,blaque,2009-02-13 20:21:00,2419," now thats the mother of all humbling experiences......i had one similiar to that once, one of those.......""that would have been me moments"". It'll make ya wake up different the next day"
306135,jediangler,2009-02-13 23:32:00,1923,"A real tragedy for sure. The story of the 22yr old woman crawling out, after the attic of the house was crushed through to the second floor bedroom was unbelievable. I also heard two people missed the flight out of NJ. I'm sure weather was a factor."
306191,fishing n autograph,2009-02-14 01:37:00,2540,It's scary because i'll be flying out of Buffalo in a month!
306369,Billy Bob,2009-02-14 17:57:00,5865,I am only about 10 miles from crash site. Kept listening to the call box thinking we would get dispatched for mutual aid as we are the one of the biggest fire departments around but we never got called out.  My thoughts and prayers to all the family members involved.  Bob
306381,Gerritt,2009-02-14 19:09:00,6129,Billy Bob... you are a firefighter? if so my hat goes off to you and all those that put their life on the line for someone elses..  Said to hear the news about the plane and all those people.... I hope they believed in a higher power...  G
306627,Sandbag,2009-02-15 04:28:00,533,Tragic indeed  My prayers are with the families.  Amazing more people on the ground were not killed.  Small miracle  Craig
306643,CLofchik,2009-02-15 05:37:00,854,"Dash 8's are known for their effective de-icing equipment, so it could be a maintenance issue seeing as how it was a smaller commuter airline.  It will take awhile to hunt down exactly what it was, but odds are it was probably a small widget that was due to be replaced ""later""."
306695,Billy Bob,2009-02-15 14:37:00,5865,It was reported that this plane was built new in May '08 so it wasn't even a year old.  Most reports here in the Buffalo area are saying it probably was icing because other planes reported icing that day.
