306309,Cudz,2009-02-14 14:19:00,2652,"Went  out to my hut on BBP and it is gone!  Must have blown away.  Maybe it is in Beaverton?? Iti s an old semi-portable, yellow, canvas sided 2 man hut.  It was anchored down but with the melt and the strong wind combined with its light weight has obviously caused it to blow away. If anyone sees a random hut blowing around can you contact me please my hut number is HU2755 i think  the hut has the words ""Hardwater Tony"" written on it.  any help would be greatful.  I don't want to get fined by the MNR. thanks"
306311,Cudz,2009-02-14 14:23:00,2652,Ok I found it. It wasn't far but it was blown apart into a hundred pieces. Now I just have to pick up the debris.
306313,richyb,2009-02-14 14:35:00,774,"This is a copy and paste from another site about a yellow hut a guy seen bening blown past him ,,,,,  Title -  YELLOW HUT AT BP ""was out with a friend today and this hut all most hit us! as it zoomed by at about 30km/hr and toppeled about 100 yards away all in all I think it traveled about 600 yards south east from where it started out .....you might want to get your gear!! I tried to up right it myself, but in the pouring rain I could not get enough grip to get it done! I did how ever pick up all the stuff off the ice (two rods spool of power pro line propane tank and other small stuff..cans... and put them in your hut! """
306349,johnnyb,2009-02-14 16:11:00,3413,"LOL -- that is hilarious!  Good thing you found it, Cudz....was your tackle still in there?"
306353,Beats,2009-02-14 16:26:00,543,"IS that describing your hut?  If so that's too funny.  I mean, it sucks about the hut but I guess it wasn't quite as secured and strong as previously thought.  Guess you need to check up on the hut a bit more often.  Lucky it didn't slam into someone or their hut."
306398,Cudz,2009-02-14 20:43:00,2652,"I don't think it is my hut.  My hut is in tatters.  A bunch of pieces. I need to go clean up the area tonight. Mine was yellow but I never leave anything inside of it.  I always take out all my gear and my propane tank. Must have been another yellow hut. Maybe yellow huts are not good, will have to paint mine a different colour when I rebuild it."

306587,lunkerbasshunter,2009-02-15 03:04:00,2585,dude that sucks!  glad you found it though  cheers!
306703,motv8tr,2009-02-15 15:09:00,2587,"Sorry to hear about your hut, that really sucks, but I'm glad you didn't lose any of your gear...good move on your part....  Maureen"
306708,TroutnMuskieHunter,2009-02-15 15:24:00,1362,  Too bad to hear about your hut...good on you though for going out and cleaning up the debris   ....a lot of people would have just left it out there on the ice to eventually float away or sink
306710,jwl,2009-02-15 15:28:00,1056," I agree man,,,good job, sucks about your hut, but way to go for being someone who took the responsibility for it and got out there to clean it up"
306721,Greencoachdog,2009-02-15 16:28:00,8163, LMAO!!!... or PINK even!!!
306886,Radnine,2009-02-16 02:55:00,1538," Good thing you've got all summer to build a new one. Oops! Sorry, I mistook this for the teacher bashing thread."
