306363,bassjnkie,2009-02-14 17:31:00,1101,"They are designed incorrectly, IMO. Back in the day they worked great, then they came out with the twist type that never turned off. They discontinued the twist type and brought back the push and pull. I always have problems with them, I called the company and they replaced them, out of the 10 that were replaced 2 worked. I would have to say buyer beware."
