His huts are always clean and he always provides you with tonnes of bait.  The fishing was really tough.  I caught the first Whitefish at 10:30am, a chunky 3 pounder on a jigging spoon.  Then my friend Greg caught this 5 pounder outside of the huts on the same spoon.  Greg bringing the fish to the surface.    Greg with his prize catch of the day    The balance of the day was pretty tough.  We only caught one more fish on a spreader at about 4pm.  Ken said the all his 13 huts were pretty slow today.  There was only one hut out approximately 2 miles that had their limit of fish.  We were still fishing the far huts off of Fox island.  I guess the extreme change in weather and the high pressure system really turned the fish off."
