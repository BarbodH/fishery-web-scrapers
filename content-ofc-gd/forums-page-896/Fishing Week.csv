So far the plans are as follows:  Saturday - Travel Day Sunday - Lake Clear with my grandpa, some of his friends and a buddy of mine. Monday - Ottawa River at my buddies shack. Tuesday - Travel Day Wednesday - Thursday - Callander Bay, Lake Nipissing. Friday - Sunday - Gull Islands, Lake Nipissing (we'll stay in Callander Bay if they are biting though).  And back to school Monday   . I'll have the camera taped to my hand so hopefully we can get some fish. I figured that since I wouldn't be able to get to the outdoors show down in TO I had to make it up somehow  Oh and if anybody knows where they are biting on Lake Nipissing feel free to share"
