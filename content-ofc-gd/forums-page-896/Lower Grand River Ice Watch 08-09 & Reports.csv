I would be VERY wary.... On CHCH News as I speak.. the pictures and video look brutal!! I also know what I saw flowing over the Caledonia dam... not a pretty site... Be safe out there folks!!!  Many homes,trailers and cottages flooded.... Some with bad damage from the ice flowing down the river..... Hope they had insurance!  G"

306190,Marko,2009-02-14 01:35:00,854,"Grand river in Kitchener is good  5-6 foot higher then normal levels, at least its clear of ice. Be careful out there guys, maybe its better to stay home for few days until river settles down a little bit. Better safe then sorry"
306227,brifishrgy,2009-02-14 03:20:00,559,  might want to wait till March 1st for that .. season for netting doesnt open till then (page 11 of the regs)
