306368,knotaclue,2009-02-14 17:56:00,136,Anybody now whatâ€™s going on in Muskoka? I just got a call from a friend telling me that all the snowmobile trails are closed due to a land dispute. Anybody know anything? I was planning to go out on the holiday Monday
306447,irishfield,2009-02-14 22:37:00,26272,Don't know about a land dispute...but I've heard on the radio that almost all the OFS trails are closed = no snow - flooded trails.
306637,Sinker,2009-02-15 05:08:00,8692,"Our trails here are glare ice. If they're not ice, they're bare ground. Im not surprised they're closed, but not sure about a land dispute.......  Sinker"
