I don't know when it stopped or what happeded because I went to university and had no money to spend on fishing and then after that I lived outside of Canada for about 11 years.  When I moved back in 2005 i didn't see any fishing show advertised in Pickering. What happened to the show?  I can remember it being well attended.

I went back a few years later and they were sharing the building with the flea market.  They only occupied a small section of the building and it was a waste of time.  The building where they were held is no longer there.  I think that Andy Pallotta was the organizers of one of the shows there.  He is now running the show at the International Centre.  It was nice having a show in the east end, but I think three shows a year in Toronto is a bit much.  I think that we might be better off with one than two."
