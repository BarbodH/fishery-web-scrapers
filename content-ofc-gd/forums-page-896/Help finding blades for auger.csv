305351,motv8tr,2009-02-12 13:25:00,2587,"I have a Finbore III auger that needs new blades.  I have looked at CTC in Midland and Wal-Mart in Barrie, no luck at either, anyone have other ideas?  Will any auger blade do?  I've left it late, but need them for Saturday for those who don't have augers...  Thanks  Maureen"
305378,Bitsmith2k,2009-02-12 14:53:00,396,  what size?
305379,Jet,2009-02-12 14:54:00,364,"I have the exact same auger. Call Normark directly. They can either send you new blades or you can go into their office and they'll inspect them and/or buy them on the spot.  Normark Inc 1350 Phillip Murray Ave Oshawa, ON L1J 1A1 (905) 571-3001"
305388,irishfield,2009-02-12 15:34:00,26272, I couldn't find the curved blades in stock anywhere local Maureen and ended up ordering them from Wholesale Sports in Alberta. I also bought a hand sharpener and worse case I can give the blades a couple of licks with it when I get there Sat am for you. Just can't guarantee how early I'll be there is all..
305395,johnnyb,2009-02-12 15:59:00,3413,"Well, if anyone is coming all the way down from Sundridge, the outfitters at Bernard Lake have them...I know because I just replaced mine up there.  So all you folks coming from a little further away, start checking your local bait shops!"
305402,ecmilley,2009-02-12 16:06:00,2163,"I never had a problem finding blades for my fin-bore, havn't replaced them in 3 years anyway but usually gagnon's in oshawa always had them in stock"
305403,Guest gbfisher,2009-02-12 16:18:00,0,"I think Fishing depot might have them. 416 614 7222. I know they have blades for the 6"". I recall Brian saying he had a few sizes left."
305458,cram,2009-02-12 18:57:00,1733,"Normark, in oshawa.  They may even be able to courier them to you."
305459,tinbanger,2009-02-12 19:01:00,1028,I'll have my auger on Saturday . Will be glad to drill any holes for those who need. Just as long as it's perch they are interested in .  TB
305466,motv8tr,2009-02-12 19:11:00,2587,Thanks for the info guys....I'll check a couple more places in the area or see if I can find someone who can sharpen the ones I have....maybe Backwater tackle?  Dave I appreciate that....  Maureen
305842,Sinker,2009-02-13 04:54:00,8692,"Gagnons had some last week. Assuming its an 8""??? They were $45.99.  Sinker"
305874,motv8tr,2009-02-13 10:46:00,2587,"  That price seems a bit steep to me...if it's true, then it will be a long while before I buy new blades....as for the size, not sure...maybe 6""?  Maureen"

306116,Sinker,2009-02-13 23:00:00,8692,"That was the price. NO kidding!!! I didn't buy them there for that reason, but I also couldn't find them anywhere else either. I bought blades for my swedebore instead. $25........  Sinker"
306265,Photoz,2009-02-14 09:06:00,792,"It has been politely pointed out to me I have one o' them thar CHEAP augers that take CHEAP blades, so perhaps Gagnon's price wasn't so far outta line as I fingered it t'was? Hope I didn't send anybody over to Lebarons DEMANDING the same deal as I THOUGHT I got?"
306272,Beans,2009-02-14 11:19:00,3339,YOU...bought sumpin' cheap !!!  I find that hard to believe knowing how much you spend on fishing  and camera equipment not to mention trucks and vans...
