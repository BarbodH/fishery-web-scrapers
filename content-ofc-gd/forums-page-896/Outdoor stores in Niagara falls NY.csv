306692,TerryC,2009-02-15 14:21:00,196,"I am heading down to the falls with my wife and kids for a couple off days of shopping and am looking for some input on stores in the niagara falls (American side) area with fishing gear. Please help me cause if I gotta spend two days shopping for kids clothes I will probably launch myself over the falls, minus the barrel!  Any pointers would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks,   Clarence"

306713,smokin joe,2009-02-15 15:35:00,226,"There's also Gander Mountain, but it's not in the Falls either.  It's in Tonawonda.  Take the 190 to the 290 and then the Colvin Ave exit North.  It's right there at the Hwy on the left."
306714,Billy Bob,2009-02-15 15:38:00,5865,"Of course we have Dicks Sporting Goods in the Galleria Mall that is right at the Thruway exit in Cheektowaga and  we also have Gander Mountain in Tonawanda but you probably don't want to miss Rainbow Sports in NORTH Tonawanda. Don't let the small store front fool you. This place is HUGE. It goes all the way back to the next street. They have stuff that no other bait and tackle shop has in stock. Here's some info on Rainbow Sports.  Rainbow Sports 267 Oliver St North Tonawanda, NY 14120 (716) 692-7510  Dicks Sporting Goods Walden Galleria Mall 2 Walden Galleria Buffalo, NY 14225 716- 651-0600  Gander Mountain 880 Young Street, Tonawanda, NY, 14150, (716) 743-2300  The closest would be Rainbow Sports to Niagara Falls with the next being Gander Mountain. Both only 10-15 minutes away.  If I were you I wouldn't miss Rainbow Sports in NT.  Bob"
306726,BillM,2009-02-15 16:50:00,17367,Rainbow sports is kinda small though.  I'd hit Gander...  It's huge and has all kinds of fun stuff
