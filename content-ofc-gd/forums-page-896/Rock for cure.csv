Just watching the maddness of people just having to own a starbucks coffee maker in the silent auction was well worth the price of admission.. lol. No wonder some families are broke with this cocaine modified coffee out there!  Thanks to everyone that supported this fund raiser... I think the final tally was approaching $5000 raised for research into this terrible, (currently) uncureable, disease."

306434,irishfield,2009-02-14 22:05:00,26272,He stole the night! Cory Heuvel is what he goes by... but his last name is really Van Den Heuvel ( just like Leah's maiden name!) Looks just like one of her cousins. Did you not buy one of his CD's before you left...

306440,irishfield,2009-02-14 22:11:00,26272,"I should have grabbed two or there... but we only got one. He's a local Barrie boy and you can probably track him down.. or I can get his info, probably, to do so. He was selling at the absolutely ridiculous price of $5"
