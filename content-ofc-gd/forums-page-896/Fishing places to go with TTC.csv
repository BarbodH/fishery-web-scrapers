306648,badboi,2009-02-15 06:01:00,12,"hey all,  so I finally have a week off... is there any place worth dropping a line that is accessible with TTC or GO Train?  thanks for any suggestions"
306705,majorlifts,2009-02-15 15:17:00,171,"Well theres Leslie spit, (frozen), theres Toronto Harbor, mmmmm, not sure what else, and I have lived here quite a while. Most of the areas reached by TTC are either frozen or a long walk to get to. But hey dont give up. I used to drive my bicycle from finch and birchmount to the scarborough bluffs with a rod and williams spoon just to catch browns, I caught one off the rocks, but its dangerous this time of year cause the rocks are slippery. So if you go down there, good luck and be careful."
306733,bigugli,2009-02-15 17:07:00,6138,Do folks still ice fish Grenadier pond?  You could start backpacking the waterfront from the Humber to Commisioners st. and find casting spots along the way.  Would take you a couple of days.
306735,badboi,2009-02-15 17:46:00,12,"Thanks for the suggestions  I would like to make it a one day trip kinda thing no overnighters....  what about Toronto Islands...are they open for fishing now, pike possibly?"
306741,tdotfisherman,2009-02-15 18:09:00,317, Yeah.. Pike in Toronto are open right now.. up until the end of March..  As for the Toronto Islands.. I'd imagine that all the good canals are frozen solid.. has anyone been there in the last little while?
