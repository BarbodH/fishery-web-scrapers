That saved me almost a hour walking. I don't think my hut has ever moved that fast.  This was Maxwell's first time on the ice and for a 2 year old he was very curious where the holes went and after he put my ice scoop down, why I could not get it back for him to play with  Bill it was great too see you again and borrow your scoop for a bit  It would have been better if it was none stop whittie action but hey thats fishing  the weather and company could not have been any better. Cheers all        "
