Can anyone provide some info as to the ice conditions?  also I am thinking of stopping at the Beaver and Bighead rivers to fish for trout at the mouths. Anyone have any info on this?  Is it worth the trip up there from TO or is it all muddy? Any and all info is, of course, appreciated!"
306315,kayak fisher,2009-02-14 14:41:00,66,"Anyone tried ice fishing for bows on GB? I know there are sometimes people around Meaford, anyone have any luck with this?"
306339,Spiel,2009-02-14 15:42:00,9065,I would say for certain that those rivers will be MUD.
306345,kayak fisher,2009-02-14 16:04:00,66,"Thanks for the response... I kind of figured that they might be murky!  I guess that I will go in the other direction.  We are heading up to Silent Lake by Bancroft to do some ice fishing instead.  I have fished a few lakes in the area and caught splake and decent size rock bass.  Never actually fished silent lake though, but I hear there are some okay size lakers.  Winter Camping for the Weekend!  I finally get to break in some new Sorels!"

306357,steelhead hunter,2009-02-14 16:55:00,152,both the beaver and bighead are unfishable and yes they do ice fish bows in the harbour of meaford and do pretty good
