306390,jat,2009-02-14 20:15:00,138,I was heading out toward innisfil beach area and was wondering how it is to walk out a few km's.thanks
306397,Cudz,2009-02-14 20:40:00,2652,"Walk is fine. No snow only ice.  Everyone is driving theirs cars everywhere.  18"" of good ice. I didn't have cleats today and the walk was fine."
306404,irishfield,2009-02-14 21:00:00,26272," Well we saw 13 to 14"" and full of air bubbles.... but still plenty safe for vehicles. Lots of pressure cracks.. don't slow down!  We drove from Innisfil Beach to Kempenfelt Bay and back today."
306421,Cudz,2009-02-14 21:50:00,2652,"I had 18"" in one place and about 16"".  There were pressure cracks though and some good sized ones."
306424,irishfield,2009-02-14 21:52:00,26272,"We crossed a few that were probably 8 to 10 inches wide.. and the ""trough"" refrozen. On the way back in there was a few spots that were starting to shear over top of each other."
306485,Fisherman,2009-02-14 23:40:00,7201,News said there was one that went through around Hawkstone and another up around Strawberry Is.

306618,siwash,2009-02-15 04:20:00,683,"Wow, people are still driving their cars out on the ice? Why would you do that? The car isn't insured if it goes through and your life isn't either..."
