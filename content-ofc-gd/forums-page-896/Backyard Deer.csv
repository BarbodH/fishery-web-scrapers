Weather was mild so after looking out my bedroom window I noticed the deer moving in to feed on some of the vegetation just behind our fence in the conservation area. Grabbed my coffee and my camera and headed out for some shots.   By diggyj, shot with DSC-W5 at 2009-02-14  Here they come, one after the other.   By diggyj, shot with DSC-W5 at 2009-02-14  Can hunting really be this easy?   By diggyj, shot with DSC-W5 at 2009-02-14  After such a great siteing, headed down to the Fishing Show, spent a bomb which angered the wife, end of story. I did make it up to her though.  Dirk...."
