306416,Spiel,2009-02-14 21:44:00,9065,"That is pretty nasty. There was no doubt it'd blow out and flood, just a matter of the flood surge reaching the lower river then......ice gone!"
306422,Joeytier,2009-02-14 21:51:00,3990,Ouch!
306609,Garry2Rs,2009-02-15 04:09:00,1425,"Don't worry, everyone with a home on the flood plane will rebuild and be ready for the next time."
306633,smbhunter,2009-02-15 04:37:00,186,I wonder if Fishmaster's place ok.

306639,CLofchik,2009-02-15 05:23:00,854,"I was by Caledonia today, and the water there is starting to go down now that it's flowing in the lower. Still really high, but not out of the ordinary for the season.    Those aren't rocks, that's the ice everybody is talking about.  Every tree on the island has the bark cleaned off on the upstream side.  And yup, it's about 6' higher than it usually is.    No kidding.  "
306657,lew,2009-02-15 10:35:00,12766,I caught something on the news this morning where in a CCG ice breaker is gonna bust out the ice jams and get the water flowing outta there. Always a shame to see peoples homes getting damaged like that.
306688,Spiel,2009-02-15 14:01:00,9065," I found some news on that this morning, posted here."
306696,Big Cliff,2009-02-15 14:42:00,6899,"Glad to hear your place is OK Steve, I feel sorry for the others that weren't so lucky. I think maybe I'll hold off heading down there for some smelts for another week."
