We are intending to go up to Simcoe for the day.  Can someone out there please advise us on a reputable ice-hut operator in an area of the lake where lakers and whities are being caught...  I haven't been up there in years and last I went I didn't even rent.  I've tried the Lake Simcoe message board, but I cannot for the life of me figure out how to register there... in fact, there is no way to do this now... their system must be fdown...  Thanks so very much in advance... looking forward to sharing my fishing adventure here.  swordfish"

306389,siwash,2009-02-14 20:11:00,683,Thanks guys! Was hoping to stick to the west side...
306464,Mike Pike,2009-02-14 23:04:00,1332,"If you want to stick to the West side, there are several operators who primarily fish perch.  Terry Goy out of Gilford is a good guy with a good operaton.  He is set up for perch( and occassionally pike ).  Then there is Lucky Sons out of Lefroy.  He has huts in perch water and further out in trout/whitefish water.  Google for contact info, etc.  Goodluck and I hope you guys have a good time wherever you decide to go!"
306629,siwash,2009-02-15 04:30:00,683,Thanks... I think we're gonna try Hanks Huts out of JP  Let u know how it goes!!
306727,luv2drift,2009-02-15 16:51:00,147,Love 2 fish simcoe....i think is the best he moves his huts around and stays ontop of the perch.   If you want whities and lakers dont use a hut.  You have to move.
306736,siwash,2009-02-15 17:57:00,683,"Well, we're using a hut cause my dad is 73 and prefers to stay put! Actually, it's more of an excuse to spend time together than to catch... if we catch, great!  I am hoping Hank chums his holes or perhaps even moves the huts around around?  Don't lakers hold in certain areas? Like along ridges, drop offs?  Thanks again!"
306749,purekgw,2009-02-15 19:04:00,585,just use your dead bait to chum holes pop there air blaters and let em go down
