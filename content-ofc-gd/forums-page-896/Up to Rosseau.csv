I tell you he's got a great set up, about 3 mins from the docks and and less than 100 yard walk to great fishing. It was great day to fish (maybe a little too much sun) as there was just a skiff of snow on the ice. Ice was about 8 inches or so. Fished in 60' and had a number of hits but mostly on the lines we weren't jiggin. lol Around noon, I see a rod going off and my older son was the closeset so I yell at him to grab it and sure enough he pulls up a 1 or 2 lb laker. Haven't been able to take my guys out fishing too much with all of their sports so this was their first time on the ice and they were quite happy. Rushing around in the moring I forgot to bring snacks so they being that age, 12 & 16, were starving. But even so we had a great day and there was no hesitation when I asked if they wanted to do it again.  Good Fishing, Doug"
