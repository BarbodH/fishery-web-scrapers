319070,Fang,2009-03-19 02:04:00,1330,"Was up 2 weeks ago. there was a little over 12-14 inches on main lake, no snow and by the end of the Saturday top 2-3 inches were really soft and wet. The normal open water around some of the dock bubblers had grown quite a bit since Feb trips  would imagine there's been a steady erosion since then. sorry haven't heard any more recent reports"
