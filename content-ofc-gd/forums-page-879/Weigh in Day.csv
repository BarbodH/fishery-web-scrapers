319682,pigeonfisher,2009-03-20 19:46:00,696,"Well,  We have to weigh in every two weeks here in the office for a little contest that is going on.  Down to 226 from about 256 on January 1.  Five more lbs and I qualify for $100 per month savings off the health insurance.  Exercise seems to be the key, along with moderation.  Eventually I will plateau...But not yet!  Feeling good.  My legs are burning from the mornings activities, I think I like it.  How are the rest of you doing?"
319698,misfish,2009-03-20 20:33:00,29133,SUPER STEVE JUST SUPER.  Yer are at a great pace and good on ya for doing what yer doing.  Keep up the great work.
319701,GBW,2009-03-20 20:38:00,8460,"congrats! if you drink coffee switch to milk instead of cream and try and cut the sugar out to, it will help."
319726,John,2009-03-20 21:39:00,2956,"Dang Steve you are making me look really bad! If I could get down to 225 I could get into a single extra fat rather than the current double extra fat!  Congratulations Bud, you should be proud!"
319727,misfish,2009-03-20 21:41:00,29133, Yep.
319730,irishfield,2009-03-20 21:50:00,26272,220 down to 211... all them holes in the ice did me good ! That and working steady each day in the shop and skipping the fruit loops for a few weeks ! lol Now if I could just dump that 6 liters of Pepsi a day.....

319782,pigeonfisher,2009-03-20 23:45:00,696,I actually dropped all the white stuff in my coffee.  Really liking it.  I only end up having a couple of cups a day now.  I have a lot of energy from my morning workout and the coffee pushes me over the edge.  One day I had to leave the office and go for a quick walk to burn some energy.  John...You could get it done.  The exercise is fun.  I like Jim Rome and now I get to listen to about 45-60 minutes a day of Rome.
319821,misfish,2009-03-21 00:55:00,29133," That mix will kill ya Wayne,go with the water.   Funny you mention that Steve. Im looking at going to the local boxing club now.Not for the boxing,but as they have the bag to hit and that Im sure, will fix my frustration, and hitting the bag is better then hitting something/someone else."
319840,camillj,2009-03-21 01:25:00,1988, Could be worse ... could be 6 liters of ABSOLUT  Although I think the calorie count would still be about the same .... at least the sugar count would be down
319882,Governator,2009-03-21 02:25:00,879,I'm failing miserably...
