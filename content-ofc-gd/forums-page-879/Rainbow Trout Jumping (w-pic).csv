319613,highdrifter,2009-03-20 16:36:00,2534,I remember the day we notched that first weir..  I was volunteering with Ontario Streams as a wee lad.  Always gives me a good feeling when I see the fish make it over..  Thanks for that!  HD
319622,silvio,2009-03-20 17:06:00,433,Good on you highdrifter for making a difference. Beauty pic bud.

319724,Joeytier,2009-03-20 21:35:00,3990,Amazing shot.  That would make a nice desktop background.
319774,Jon,2009-03-20 23:29:00,209,Highdrifter:  I was one of the guys that helped out.  Can't say I remember you but it is nice to see the benefits.  Hope you are still in the business.  Jon
319780,highdrifter,2009-03-20 23:40:00,2534," Wish I had a scanner, I still have the pictures.  Was a warm day in November no?  Mark Heaton and Doug Forder were there that morning.  I had on that red white and blue tommy shirt.  We also did a little electro fishing afterwards..  If that's the first weir I'm thinking about, we were both there!!"
