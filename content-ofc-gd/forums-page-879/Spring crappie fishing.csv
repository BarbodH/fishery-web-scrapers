314813,bigugli,2009-03-08 15:29:00,6138,  Binbrook was closed for the season as of March 5th and will not be open until May.
314815,ColdH20guy,2009-03-08 15:36:00,312,"hi guys...just curious of some of the preferred methods for crappie in the spring..I'm assuming small hook, jig /minnow combination? similar to ice fishing..any other baits/lured for the little critters? thx"
314819,Guest skeeter99,2009-03-08 15:45:00,0,just go to scugog  you will get 20 to 30 eaters easy  and less than a hour from toronto
314917,Beans,2009-03-08 21:06:00,3339," 1/16th ounce or 1/32nd ounce jig inside a micro tube...(try various colors/combinations)...under a light slip float...  Keep in mind to not fish on bottom...crappie are always looking upwards for food...not hard to catch if they are ""on""..."
314987,Ron,2009-03-09 00:26:00,1683,Beans has pretty much got it. The only thing I would add is to have another rod set up with a beetle spin type lure on another rod. You can use this to search for active fish and then hone in on the school by finesse fishing the area.
319625,ozaibak1,2009-03-20 17:25:00,401,"Hi I found a very good site for crappie fishing, well a post on crappie fishing. It has links to techniques as well as WHERE to fish for them in Ontario, this is a very good resource to answer your question and others raised in the replies: http://www.smartanglers.com/main/node/6937"
319630,hookerdown,2009-03-20 17:52:00,110,"As someone stated earlier, check your regs to make sure the lake you choose is actually open to fishing (of any type).  The lake I fish for Pike/Walleye openner is closed to ice fishing and does not open for any type of fishing until openner in May.  But then again, you can help the economy and get a nice fat fine, I hear they are tough to chew but are not bad once you clean em."
319650,buckster,2009-03-20 18:40:00,530,  Maybe i gotta try my luck on these crappie..... so just a small float and a small jig.....who knew!
319699,Big Cliff,2009-03-20 20:35:00,6899,"Ahhh but there is one that out preforms them all, I could tell you what it is but then I'd have to kill you!"
319711,GBW,2009-03-20 20:55:00,8460,hum... I have never fished for and or caught a crappie before (bass only person but that's changing ) so now I guess I have to try for them with all these posts about how good it is...  Are they good eats?  what taste is it most like?
319712,GBW,2009-03-20 20:56:00,8460,and don't say FISH!
319713,buckster,2009-03-20 20:56:00,530,  Hmmmm i might know what your talking about
319793,ozaibak1,2009-03-20 23:56:00,401," They are DELICIOUS. Similar to other fish with white flesh, sorta a cross between bass/perch/pike/walleye. I caught these buggers while fishing for bass/perch at night in the summer time and they were fun to catch! The big ones come to shore at night in the summer, they become more solitary after spring. This is the first time I've learned about their spawning / spring habits so I will be targeting them every weekend on ice-out.  Seems like there's a fair amount of ppl who haven't fished for these guys that are getting interested on the board, should be good to head out to these areas together when the time comes."
307664,ERB,2009-02-18 02:14:00,35,"Looking for some places to go Crappie fishing in the spring after the ice goes out. Would like something some what close to Toronto like 1- 1:30 hours away, that I would not need a boat to fish? Thanks"
307672,Joeytier,2009-02-18 02:42:00,3990,Anywhere on the trent river in the Kawarthas.
307676,jediangler,2009-02-18 02:56:00,1923,"Island lake conservation area in Orangeville. I don't know what your chances would be from shore but they do rent aluminum boats with electric motors as well as row boats, canoes and kayaks. Good population of crappies in there."
307707,foolinfish,2009-02-18 04:23:00,5,"The GULL RIVER where it  enters SHADOW LAKE in NORLAND .You can fish from either side and the top of the lake itself where it is near the hiway (45). Around the corner is HEAD LAKE which also can be accessed from the hiway but the best bet from shore is GULL RIVER. Be sure not to hook those muskie  northern pike and lm bass that hang around there looking for a crappie /sunfish dinner LOL. If you do get a boat ask one of the locals for the location of ""hidden cove"" foolinfish"

307784,Beans,2009-02-18 13:41:00,3339,Rice Lake...not sure of any shore access since they tore down Sandercock's Camp.
307821,diggyj,2009-02-18 15:18:00,548,"I would say Rice Lake. You can fish the Government dock in Harwood, Gore's Landing dock.  Scugog would be a good bet.  Dirk....."

Problem is, like many, many, many other spots, most of the really good spots to shore fish is now Private Property etc......Thanks to all the slobs who ruin for the rest of us. I can recall fishing out of Kewsick years ago and hammering Crappie all day long. Well, those days are loooong gonzo !! Gotta find myself a nice private spot where I can eat my fill."

307956,ERB,2009-02-18 22:23:00,35," Thing is I am only looking for the spring time so I wouldn't get to much use out of that, but it would be pretty handy. Thanks"

308974,Fang,2009-02-21 03:15:00,1330,"just be sure if you are in the kawarthas section 17, which includes scugog, all fishing is closed including crappie unitl last Sat in April.  MNR watches Scugog very close the few weekends prior to opener looking for those that go for the first run in the boat and then pull out a rod."

314213,diggyj,2009-03-07 00:50:00,548,Try Adeline Park up in Newmarket. Lots of shore spots and great springtime Crappie action.  Dirk.
