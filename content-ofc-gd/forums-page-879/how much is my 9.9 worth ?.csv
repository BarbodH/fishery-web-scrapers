318712,glen,2009-03-18 01:15:00,2641,$800
318713,Whitespinnerbait,2009-03-18 01:16:00,2038,Oh Yeah ....  That model is only worth $ 20.00 bucks ..  What's your address i'll come and pick it up right now....
318721,fish-miester,2009-03-18 01:35:00,864,haha if they were only that cheap.. but about $800 give or take?
318725,pike slayer,2009-03-18 01:50:00,1177,this past summer i bought my 1999 evinrude 9.9hp 2stroke in perfect condition just a few scratches and spotless under the hood for $600. and in the fall my buddy bought a 94 evinrude 15hp for $500 but the outside was pretty beat but it was clean and it runs great. i say thats an average price not a crazy deal.
318728,bigredfisher,2009-03-18 01:57:00,300,ill give you 200 for it if you think that might be fair
318732,Terry,2009-03-18 02:02:00,14456,between 300 and 800
318745,fish-miester,2009-03-18 02:21:00,864,k thanks guys !
318748,Cast-Away,2009-03-18 02:24:00,790,"You really need to pin down the year before you can put up an asking price. In the mean time, why don't you put masking tape over the decals and other non-paint areas and give her a couple of coats of paint to make her look better? Of course, you should sand down the paint chip areas first."
318758,2 tone z71,2009-03-18 03:03:00,1311,"put up the mod @ serial #s ill tell ya what yr it is ,by the decals it looks to be 87/88 but my mind is slipping ive been out of that rackett for a few yrs now"
318786,fish-miester,2009-03-18 05:20:00,864,"Cast-away , i was defenetly going to do that within the next week or so, it would defenetly make it look alot better"
318914,bigredfisher,2009-03-18 18:09:00,300,i can go 300
318919,blaque,2009-03-18 18:47:00,2419,"Heres the bigger question, why dont they just make a straight up 10 horse. They'd save ink on all there manuals getting rid of that stupid period between the 9 and the 9......not to mention keystrokes when doing google searches for it for the mechanics, that adds time to the labor costs, and paint when painting 9.9 on the motor hood. It'd save the kicker motor industry a boatload!"
318923,GeorgeJ,2009-03-18 18:53:00,207,"having just gone through looking for a used outboard I gave up and bought new. I found that the used outboard market is way over priced. to truly evaluate that motor you have you should supply a compression test to potential buyers and let them hear it run, if all is well, it looks to be a 80's motor making it 20 years old you should ask about $400 for it and sell it close to that."
318924,blaque,2009-03-18 19:01:00,2419,"You go George.......i did this a few years back and, well........my sentiments EXACTLY.......then i went and priced new ones and still almost fainted lol. I never did make a purchase on a gas kicker. I actually bought a high thrust electric bowmount and troll with that and it works peachy"
318968,Kerry,2009-03-18 21:29:00,383,Because at one time you didn't need #s on your boat if it was under 10hp.Hence 9.9.Not so sure if that applies nowadays.  I'd say 700 OBO.It's early in the season you'll get bites.  Kerry
318987,Guest skeeter99,2009-03-18 22:06:00,0,  that is so you dont need coast guard numbers on your boat (vessel permit) just under the legal limit horsepower of 10hp  there is a method to the madness
319154,blaque,2009-03-19 11:59:00,2419,"no kidding? hmmmm, fun fact."
319199,boatman,2009-03-19 13:53:00,350,"Spring must be apon us. There are a lot more outboard questions this week.  You need the model number for sure. Its definately 1980's. Price depends on condition. In its current cosmetic shape I wouldn't expect more than $600. Make it pretty and that increases to $800 - potentially. But don't expect a quick sale at that price. All things considered, a good running 1980's 9.9 hp should get you $400-800. Can't narrow it down more than that. Condition and demand rules all."
319207,ehg,2009-03-19 14:13:00,2666,"300 to 400 would be a reasonable price for that motor, since its older and used."
319218,boatman,2009-03-19 14:47:00,350, Too low. I buy and sell quite a few motors every year. I would buy it right now for $300.
319283,wallyboss,2009-03-19 18:50:00,1095,  And if it is under 10hp you don't need to add the h.p. of your kicker motor  to the h.p of your main motor for calculations of the Max H.P. for your vessel.
