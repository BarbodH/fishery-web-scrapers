318967,Ron,2009-03-18 21:18:00,1683,"Ah looked like a great time Wayne. Just think there wasn't too much noise in the cottage to wake up from, (snoring).....   If I'm still invited, I can see it happening next year."
318977,irishfield,2009-03-18 21:46:00,26272, Always Ron... and snoring... Lloyd does !
318989,Moosebunk,2009-03-18 22:08:00,3970,"See what happens when ya leave ""TERRY"" at home.  You guys slay 'em and don't get stuck in the snow.  Great stuff Wayne and Co.  Lots of good fish in the mix."
318990,Terry,2009-03-18 22:11:00,14456,ohhhhhh the abuse'''''''''''''''''LOL   you know what they say about pay backs  oh Lloyd....
318996,irishfield,2009-03-18 22:27:00,26272,LOL Terry... yes it was ALL Daume's idea !!
318998,TJQ,2009-03-18 22:35:00,7806,Awesome Report Wayne!!
319000,Terry,2009-03-18 22:36:00,14456,I was warning Lloyd for his part in it  it was going to be a surprise payback for you...LOL........
319021,fishhunter,2009-03-18 23:20:00,604,"Well Terry, see when I saw Wayne was not catching fish I figured I would help him out with the bait and the trick to make it work. When you seen the fish on the sonar you would yell down the hole ""Im not Terry"" and they hit lol As for the bait it was crayfish on a jig head that was the trick for the fish this trip plus my stand by white grub. Terry I thought of you everytime i hooked a fish and said i wish he was here lol It was a great trip and i so needed it!! Wayne is one hell of a host!!!!!"
319031,moose,2009-03-19 00:02:00,266,"hey wayne nice pics wish i could have been there love temagami and everything there. surprised you didnt catch anything at secret lake, havent seen that cabin in yrs, we might be going up for easter weekend , if not maybe may24 then flyin to diamond end of june , maybe well run into each other up there. you cant ever beat a temagami sunrise or sunset the most amazing sights you have ever seen . you should go up to high rock and take some pics of the sunrise and sunsets , did yrs ago but cant find the pics great report"
319054,irishfield,2009-03-19 01:08:00,26272, Hut was off the North West end of Bear... half way to Garden Island John    You haven't forgot the way have you Paul.. saw no signs of life around Rick's. No packed path even.. but I think he blew his airboat motor as he had me quote one 2 weeks ago....  We drilled 45 holes in Secret.... 25 of them on the feeding flats at the South end.. the rest along the East shoreline. Tried the same baits we had excellent luck with on Browns but to no avail. Wasn't 'till we got back to the camp that I realized Secret has lakers in it... we should have fished deep instead of shallow!   Nothing but work from here on out Brian... 'till May 10th that is...    We'll be back to the lake May 10th(God Willing).... 'till late September...maybe well into October. Drop in if you head to town for beer... I mean groceries...
319071,johnnyb,2009-03-19 02:06:00,3413,"Gotta love that Temagami scenery...great report, Wayne"
319091,Squid,2009-03-19 02:37:00,1656,"excellent report Wayne, tons of fun!!"
319101,walleyemaster,2009-03-19 02:51:00,325,Wayne....all i have to say is you guys are a bunch of rotten ....dirty....son of a.... oh yah excelent report as usual  ...i see you found the old cabin on the way into secret....kinda scary looking...well it looks like you guys had a great time...and im not Terry either
319103,irishfield,2009-03-19 02:56:00,26272, Yah.. well.. you had your chance! lol. Would never have found that trail if it wasn't for a frozen sled track in the ice!
319106,walleyemaster,2009-03-19 03:01:00,325,hey wayne did you manage to catch any of the walleye at rabbit nose...looks like you were fishing the west side.. great walleye action around them parts and east side as well....late night fishing though...
319111,tibbs,2009-03-19 03:06:00,650,Great Report!
319115,irishfield,2009-03-19 03:16:00,26272, West and East ??... do you need your compass swung? lol  Bluff is on the East shoreline of the North Arm.... we were fishing the Northern end of the rock face. Nadda.. nothing and the wind was bruttel    .. we moved on.
319187,fishhunter,2009-03-19 13:19:00,604,Wind????   We did not have any wind that day lol I dont call it wind when it tries and blow you off your sled i call that a hurricane!!!! That is one beautiful spot on the lake and one big cliff.
319201,fishnsled,2009-03-19 13:57:00,3520,Great report Wayne.  It almost felt like Terry was there with you.  Even Joe made a guest appearence.     Love the pics.
319228,highdrifter,2009-03-19 15:05:00,2534,Doozie report Wayne!!  You sure know how to put people on to fish..  wicked!  cheers HD
319269,irishfield,2009-03-19 17:37:00,26272,"The great thing Fidel is every day we fished an area in the morning and again on the way back in the evening. I bet we drilled 200 holes alone in this one area trying to determine the structure. At one point I'd gone so far off the tip of an island, drilling holes 20 feet apart, that Lloyd was going to drive me back for my sled! We did this partly to find the drop off and fish thru the ice... but secondary finding how it's all laid out in relation to easily visible landmarks so that I can downrig the area without hanging the balls on the 20 foot shelf that stretches over 600 feet out from an island that we thought would get deep quickly (and according to the charts it's supposed to).  And Will.. speaking of Joe.. he's AWOL.. but then again it's Spring Break so maybe the wife swept him off to somewhere."
319276,Jds63,2009-03-19 18:08:00,1365,great report
319311,fishhunter,2009-03-19 20:20:00,604,its always nice when you leave the ice looking like swiss cheese lol
319458,walleyemaster,2009-03-20 02:31:00,325,"mmmmuuummble...rotten....dirtyyyy..mummmmble...fricken.....of all the stinken...mummmble....i cant take it.. i missed the rough ice, crazy winds and all those fish...this work crap stuff really sucks...mummmble...damn it.."
318738,irishfield,2009-03-18 02:11:00,26272,"Lloyd buried his best friend a week ago last Monday and needed a holiday... me, well I'm game most anytime. The usual suspects and then some were invited... but it ended up being just the two of us. This worked out very well anyhow... as it allowed us to run and gun with ease to learn more of the lake, it's structure and fish movement. Lloyd had just bought a sled from Mistyriver on the way thru Toronto heading for Temagami.... had his insurance slip in hand already and changed the ownership when he hit Barrie. This made travel great for our selves and gear..... but it did take it's toll though thanks to lake conditions.  I headed for the lake about 11am on Tuesday. Arrived to find my neighbour had my laneway all prepared for me. Good thing our recently deceased neighbour, Walter Bowen, had the old dozer in the back yard on their island or this slush/snow wouldn't have been moved.    I fished off our dock in 25 FOW for a couple hours while waiting for Lloyd to arrive. He made pretty good time... left work at noon in Port Hope.. to Markham to grab his, spankin new to him, 1996 Grand Touring Skidoo. Licence bureau, grocery store for our provisions and still made Temagami by 8pm just as the sun was disappearing.  Now anyone that has fished with Lloyd knows sleep is apparently over rated! lol.. up at 5am and out. Thank God the clocks went forward... he let me sleep 'till 5:50  each morning and we fished 'till 7 or 8 PM most days.  Wednesday was about 5 degrees and a tad slushy to start out. WIND.. 90 K and gusts. Made hut set up extremely dangerous.. and we both have bruised foreheads and noses to prove it... from when the huts went ""auto set up mode"" a few times!    We moved and moved trying to get out of the wind. Here we are up by Bear Island off the entrance to Kokoko Bay. Found a wind break and fished for about 30 minutes. I snagged something with both lines and lost two hooks.. moved 35 feet and snagged something again. Tree/phone line/hydro line I don't know... just know I'm short three baits. Lloyd on the other hand... well he can pull a rabbit out of a hat it appears.    We then headed further up the lake and found someone's hut, hopefully not John the Fishermans, had tumbled for about a 1000 feet. We picked up the wreckage... fishing rods.. axe... heater.. propane bottles and put it all inside the wreckage and moved on.    Lloyd wanted me to try out his sled... so here he is driving my train headed for home. We couldn't take the wind anymore and couldn't get out of it no matter how we tried. In at 2:30 on day one. Temps dropped so quick the snow flash froze in less than an hour and man what a ROUGH ride home that was.    Next morning up and out early (6:30) and it was -21C but thankfully sunny. Didn't take Lloyd long to get the first.....      and second    Amazing how fast 7:30 PM comes when you're havin fun !    Friday brought -25/26C.. but again sunshine... and again high winds.  Shameless spam.. lol    Shortly after... our first whitie of the trip and the only fish of the day if I remember correctly.    Just so you know what I caught... You're a funny guy Lloyd !      Next day out, not far from home, we came across this mess. I have no problems with the fish etc on the ice ( the birds had it gone next day)...but why kill the ling for nothing... and ummmm the illegal chub bait is not good.      Setting up in the early section of the North Arm    We caught nothing there.. marked lots like many places... just not interested. They'll follow but not hit and it started to get frustrating. We talked to many on the lake and the same was the norm most everywhere. Decided we'd go hit a back lake, Secret, and despite drilling 45 holes.. we couldn't buy a fish there either. Beauty spot though !    Smacked my auger on the way out.. bending the throttle lever.. cross bar etc. Just one of many things buggered in 6 days.    Abandoned cabin on the way out of the trail    Decided to hit the renowned Rabbit Nose Bluffs on the way back out. Doesn't look that big 'till you spot that hut at the bottom of it !    Didn't mark or catch anything there.. Gave it a bit..and note Lloyd is sitting in 70 FOW that close to shore.    and then headed in just before dark stopping in Portage bay so Lloyd could pull a Whitie from someone's old hole.    Saturday it didn't take us long to get into some fish. Changed our tactics a bit and it worked.                    Released..    Sunday was so gorgeous... after 4 days of high wind Sunday was dead calm and hit about 10C. Didn't take us long to decide we didn't wanna pack up at noon.. so we didn't and stayed the full day and overnight. Heck we'll fish Monday tooooo.      Can't beat hot soup on the ice...    And hot sandwich wraps...    The end to an absolutely beautiful day on the ice... well almost the end.        I talked Lloyd into staying out after the sun had gone down completely... and I don't think he was too upset with my request !      Monday Lloyd got up at 6 and headed out... I just couldn't do it... stayed in bed 'till 7 with 5 hours sleep! Soon after me arriving at our meeting spot.. Lloyd with another.    and another    We headed in at noon and I had Lloyd on his way by 1pm... well until he stuck his van and sled trailer thru the upper crust of the ice road. Pulled him out with my trusty ford and he was on his way. I packed up.. winterized the plumbing again and headed over to my neighbours to check out their building progress. Just after arriving their kitchen cupboards showed up. YES driving on the ice is a way of life...    And as for the busted stuff. Anyone pulling a hut take note. We lost most of the bolts/nuts out of both our huts. NYTROL don't mean ....... ! They loosened and fell off ! Llloyd had carriage bolts break the heads right off on his. Lost UHMW wear strips. Lost hitch pins. Lloyd's 22 year old auger that has been everywhere... power head bolts backed off and we had to dismantle the gear box to tighten them up. My hut is full of holes... from the hoop tubes bouncing and rubbing thru the material. The handle even fell off my coffee pot that I boil the soup water in. Lloyd left his hut way behind one day and I had a good laugh... then 2 hours later... he got the laugh. Lost my snow shoes and found them later.. Lloyd had his rod bag fly out of his COVERED hut and also his seat cushion. All found. Other stuff broke as well... it seemed to be endless... but our sleds ran perfect... all 380KM we put on them !!  Minimum ice thickness we found anywhere on the lake was 24 inches. Many places the auger handles were just above the ice at break through. Should do this every week... lost 8 lbs drilling over 200 holes....  Now bring on the soft water... the boats ready to go....."

We picked up the wreckage... fishing rods.. axe... heater.. propane bottles and put it all inside the wreckage and moved on.  I must say that it was very windy on Friday, and my hut did move a bit.  About 20 ft, but thank Christ that was not my hut you came upon.  I am sure whoever owned (not much good now) that one appreciated your help in gathering up their stuff.  Good post and pics.  And yes I agree with you about leaving the mess, and using those Chub.  They don't come from here, so they don't belong here (unless their used as dead baits).  JTF"
