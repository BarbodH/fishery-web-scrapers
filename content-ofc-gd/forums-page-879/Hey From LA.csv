While y'all are experiencing some interesting weather, I haven't seen a cloud in the week i've been here and it's been over 22C every day1  Anyway, i've probably snapped well over 1200 pics since Saturday and I can't wait to get them home and being working on them. We went to the Pacific Coast Highway and it has to be the most beautiful thing that I have ever seen! The combination of the beautiful views    and the whales and dolphins roaming up and down the coast is enough to make a person want to move out here!  Take care  Dave"
