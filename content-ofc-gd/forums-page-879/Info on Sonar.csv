319152,hogman3006,2009-03-19 11:44:00,41,"I am going to buy a new unit this year. I have been looking at the side imaging stuff from Humminbird. My questions are, can these units be used as regular sonar as well? I can't find any information anywhere. How well do they perform at locating fish? Would anybody recommend them? Just to start an discussion, what is the best bang for your buck out there?"
319170,Uncle Buck,2009-03-19 12:43:00,1000,the side imaging units can be use as a regular sonar also...  they perform well  here are some pics...  http://imageevent.com/okoboji_images/hummingbirdsideimaging  best bang for your buck is humminbird...
319178,motion,2009-03-19 12:54:00,403,Lowrance would be my choice. Just picked up a new LMS-522C from Radio World. I think its a good unit for under $600.00 if you are looking for a Sonar/GPS combo.  http://radioworld.ca/product_info.php?cPat...roducts_id=3051
319227,Pigeontroller,2009-03-19 15:01:00,2793,"I would head to Woodstock and talk to Jocelyn Leung at Angling Outfitters, he carries Lowrance and Humminbird, he knows his stuff! And I think he deals in used stuff/trade ins."
319231,Handlebarz,2009-03-19 15:15:00,3790,I second a  road trip to Woodstock or atleast call him his is always willing to help you out I picked up a 522c this winter and loved it for the ice. I als ofound a few new spots on LSC to try this year that I did not know about.
319244,Billy Bob,2009-03-19 16:16:00,5865,"If your really want Side Imaging Lowrance's new HDS units that are now on sale will be getting a upgrade sometime in 2009 so side imaging can be added. This is suppose to blow away HB units.  http://www.cabelas.com/cabelas/en/template...602012&rid=  and info on Lowrance's Side Imagining.  http://www.lowrance.com/en/HDS-Revolution/...ing-Sonar-Video  SO, you can spend some money on the BEST sonar unit with that being a Lowrance HDS unit and by fall side imaging can be added."
319265,dim.,2009-03-19 17:11:00,16,"But clever conception - please buy HDS now for 1K$ and later on we will give SI module + SI transducer for extra money. Thanks. But no, thanks."
319267,dim.,2009-03-19 17:26:00,16,Take a look at SI images here http://imageevent.com/okoboji_images/hummi...mp;x=0&p=14
319293,DRIFTER_016,2009-03-19 19:36:00,10439,IMO unless you are searching for sunken ships or fishing under docks SI is a waste of money. I would rather have the ability to shoot forward so I can see that reef I'm about to hit before I hit it.
319472,walleyemaster,2009-03-20 03:08:00,325,i heard that the updates have started for the units already..i just got one cant wait to hook it up
319511,sonny,2009-03-20 11:16:00,511,"I have the humminbird 797si ,,,Its been a great unit,,,i would highly recommend them!!The new model is the 798si,,,if you want specific questions answered just pm me!"
319563,outdoorguy61,2009-03-20 14:33:00,220,"Lowrance is supposed to be having some major software problems, with both the side imaging and any HD model that carrys a Navionics chip. It makes me way too nervous to try them.  outdoorguy61"
319575,DRIFTER_016,2009-03-20 15:02:00,10439,"  That's why you never purchase a new product in it's first year. Hummingbird is having issues with their new flashers, only they are QC issues not software issues. The Navionics issue is that only the Platinum chips work right now. After the software update all should work."
319600,tonyb,2009-03-20 15:58:00,1637," What is with the brainwashing and Lowrance?  From what little I have seen of the Lowrance side viewing, it appears that they have licensed Humminbirds Side Imaging technology (If you can\\\'t beat \\\'em, join \\\'em right?)  You can be the judge, see screens below  Lowrance Side Viewing screenshot (reportedly...)   Humminbird Side Imaging screenshot (actual)   Also, what a lot of people are not thinking about, is that hardware as well as software upgrades will be in order.  The transducer is quite different for Side Imaging technology compared to a standard transducer.  Standard -  Side Imaging -  So, expect to spend at least another $200 on a Side scanning transducer, time to uninstall/install the old/new transducer and also the software update download/transfer/install process.  I am surprised by Lowrances\\\' strategy for launching a new product, HDS, and at the same time failing their loyal customers by not offering a product with current technology already built-in.

319739,ScugogBoy,2009-03-20 22:09:00,36,I have a really hard time trying to decifer what the side imaging is showing you........what is the line down the centre of the screen.....and do you have to turn your head sideways to see what the screen really means? Is one side if the screen to the right and the other side to the left (or front and back)....why not rotate the picture so it's easier to see? Any help in understanding this new technollogy would be helpfull....because it makes sense....how far to the side do these units show? Thanks all for your answers/if any.
