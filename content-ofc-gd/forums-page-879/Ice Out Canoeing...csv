318807,Guest Michel (Mike) Soucy,2009-03-18 10:45:00,0,"Hi Everyone,  Just joined the OFC this morning and am wondering, how many canoeing enthusiasts are out there and how early would you take to the water being mindful that it would still be fairly cold water? (capsize dangers)  I enjoy fishing from my canoe (a 16' Kevlar) and can't wait to get her out...  Thanks!"
318810,diggyj,2009-03-18 11:04:00,548,"I have noticed a couple of guys going out into Lake Ontario in my area on a daily basis, starting this week. Only one of them fishes. Yesterday he claimed to have caught about 25 fish which included: pike, white bass, carp and brown trout.  So I'd say right now is the right time to get out. Be careful and good luck.  Dirk"
318837,Ramble,2009-03-18 12:55:00,713,If the canoe will float it's time to go. This is some of the most fun you will have all year in a canoe. You can go way back into flooded forests in some places in the spring. Last year the Moira was awesome.  Ice out trout are another good option. Just try and avoid the ice coming down river.  -Dave
318846,JohnF,2009-03-18 14:03:00,3494,Saw them running the Thames up near St.Marys on Sunday.  JF
318857,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-03-18 14:39:00,0,catching brookies from the canoe casting shortly after ice out is my favourite time of year.
318861,danc,2009-03-18 14:45:00,4677,  I prefer a motorized vessel myself.  
318863,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-03-18 14:51:00,0,hahaha!  is that lake nip?
318865,Pigeontroller,2009-03-18 14:59:00,2793,If your concerned about water temps a nice paddling drysuit is the way to go! It'll cost you abit but keep you warm even if you end up in the water.
318869,danc,2009-03-18 15:06:00,4677,  It is. 4 or 5 years ago on the May long. We did good that weekend.
318881,tinbanger,2009-03-18 16:18:00,1028,Welcome Mike  Don't know much about canoing but i do know you are in great canoe country there in Kingston.  Look forward to your reports  TB
318927,ciceri,2009-03-18 19:08:00,535,"I can't wait to get out on Georgian Bay in the boat, there's something big out there waiting for me to bring her home, and it's not a fish"
318928,SNAGKING,2009-03-18 19:12:00,43,I already see some kayakers out and about.
318979,Ramble,2009-03-18 21:48:00,713, Let me know when you wanna go lol  -Dave
319075,Guest Michel (Mike) Soucy,2009-03-19 02:18:00,0,  Thanks to all the responses. I have a feeling that with these temps I'll be putting in real soon for some Pike before the season closes.
319246,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-03-19 16:23:00,0,  Unreal.  I've never made it to the lake.  Fished the river near P.P. Dam.  My partner and I caught the finest brookies either of us had ever seen.  That's God's country for sure.
319247,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-03-19 16:24:00,0, When's the ice out around these parts broseph?
319252,Ramble,2009-03-19 16:50:00,713,"very, very soon lol. River and streams should be clear....then another week or 3 depending on temps. April 1st for the trout lakes in Bancroft at the latest.  -Dave"
319258,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-03-19 16:59:00,0,wow that's early. i was ice fishing up in tbay easter weekend last year and buried my auger to get through the ice.
319314,legacey,2009-03-19 20:24:00,127,"Hey Mike,  I saw someone out in a red canoe today near the Woolen Mill in Kingston...was that you?  Cheers,  Paul"
319315,tryz2fish,2009-03-19 20:29:00,3,  wow really i was on a lake up that way on monday still had 18inches on it. i think it might be a lil later then april first although i hope its soon cause im getting sick of drillin ice its much easier to hop in a boat and go.
