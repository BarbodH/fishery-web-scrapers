319253,highdrifter,2009-03-19 16:51:00,2534,Thought that pile of drift wood in the first pick was just cleared from the ice breakers..  The city outta do a better job of keeping those ice breakers clear..  Can someone explain to me what they're there for?  Seems to me that they're doing more harm than good.
