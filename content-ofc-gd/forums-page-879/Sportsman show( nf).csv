319798,NAC,2009-03-21 00:04:00,369,"Can't help you on Ontario Place parking, except that their lots were all empty close to the show. 12 skins for parking. I just got back a half hour ago.  I'd say it's slightly better than a lot of recent ones with regards to decent sale items.  Some good deals on quality baits and lures.  Everything else seemed per norm.  Hot buy - Gulp $18ea. I won't say who, but they're in Hamilton."
