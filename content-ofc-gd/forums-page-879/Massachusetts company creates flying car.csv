Massachusetts company creates flying car 680News staff Massachusetts  | Friday, March 20th, 2009 2:27 pm   Massachusetts - It sounds like something out of the Jetsons. A Massachusetts company has created a flying car, and Thursday's test flight went well.  It's called the ""transition"" and it can reach speeds of 185 kilometres an hour.  It takes just 30 seconds after touchdown for the ""transition"" to fold its wings up and transform into a front-wheel drive two-seater car.  The transition will cost about $200 and will hit the roads and the skies in 2011.  The one downside to this flying car is that by law, it can only take off and land at an airport.

319693,pigeonfisher,2009-03-20 20:28:00,696,How many DUI's would the Pro Athletes save on if they were in the air?  It isn't that much different in price from a bentley and they only hit each other.  In fact perhaps they should market them in team colours!

I'd have to have a real close look at those wing lock pins though... but no differnet than a corsar with folding/rotating wings.  ""By law it can only land and take off at an airport""... ya right ! lol Nice straight stretch with three lanes.. right about Marion Lake on hwy 11 ! lol"
