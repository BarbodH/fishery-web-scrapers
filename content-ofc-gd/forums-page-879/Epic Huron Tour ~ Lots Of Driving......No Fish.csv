319517,Billy - Curtiss,2009-03-20 11:51:00,241, I felt rather boondoggled myself! Sounds like y'all had a blast anyhow. Good on ya!
319518,highdrifter,2009-03-20 11:53:00,2534, Lemme know when bud.  I'll give ya a buzz this weekend.  Toi aussi t'es un charmeur!!  Faut soit virer une bonne brosse ou une bonne pêche ensemble..
319541,Joey,2009-03-20 13:31:00,9122,Great pics!  I remember taking the Chi Cheemaun when we lived in Elliot Lake.  Thanks for that pic.  Joey
319549,BillM,2009-03-20 13:50:00,17367,"Mike, I have a couple of good shots of you in the middle of the river   I cropped this one a bit...  "
319210,solopaddler,2009-03-19 14:15:00,8605,"Not too much to report unfortunately. On the plus side perhaps I can help a few guys decide whether or not to head north...  Overall the day was an absolute blast. I finally managed to hook up with Fidel (highdrifter) for a day of fishing. Joining us was BillM, driving over from Barrie and meeting us at the river.  I figured the Saugeen would be rounding into form so that's where we headed first.  Here's Fidel rigging in the parking lot:    The river was super high, very cold and just barely fishable. This time of year it's all about water temperature and it's still just a bit too cold. A few more warm days, a bit more vis in the water and I'm sure it'll be game on.  Both Bill and myself briefly had fish on, a couple headshakes and gone. And that was it for action...  Nice scenery and water though:      After hopping around a few different spots at the 'geen we packed it up and headed north to the Sauble. What a contrast!! It was low and glass water clear (and seemingly devoid of fish as well  ).  Gave 'er a good shot though and thoroughly enjoyed the fishing even though there was no catching involved:          Not willing to give up the ghost we headed east to Owen Sound and finished up the day fishing the harbour on the lower Sydenham. With the water being gin clear and somewhat low the harbour is usually the better bet...  Not on this day though...dead as a doornail.    That's the way it goes sometimes. Sometimes you drive for 3 hours and fish hard for nada. It's a game of timing and it's called paying your dues.  On the plus side I made a new friend today. (I'd fish with you anytime Fidel) Next time we get out I guarantee the catching will be better!   Cheers,  Mike"
319214,silvio,2009-03-19 14:38:00,433,Fish don’t matter when your with good company. Wtg boys on getting out and having fun even though the fish didn't want to.
319219,highdrifter,2009-03-19 14:48:00,2534,Shweet!!  I've still got that stupid grin on my face..  I've got a lot to smile about though.  What a riot hahaah!  Here's to many more epic trips!  cheers HD
319222,DRIFTER_016,2009-03-19 14:52:00,10439,I knew you were mortal.
319225,NAC,2009-03-19 14:58:00,369,"I think they call those ""man-dates"" now.  Good effort guys."
319230,The Urban Fisherman,2009-03-19 15:15:00,2050,"I love the look of excitement and anticipation on HD's face while rigging up!    Been there many times gents!  As recently as last weekend! Thanks for the report!  Cheers, UF"
319234,ccmtcanada,2009-03-19 15:35:00,7971,"Great report Mike!  When I have an opportunity to fish waters where I cant spit from one bank to the other, it's a real treat!  Great photos as usual!  Meeting up with another OFNer is never a waste of time...looks like you still had a great day!"
319236,Cookslav,2009-03-19 15:49:00,1457,"Thats the Bruce boys, Hard swings, and big misses but still fun, and some beautiifull countryside to to take in. Could have been worse...could have been working"
319250,dobee,2009-03-19 16:34:00,301,Great looking scenery mike. always nice to share a day with some OFC'ers!
319257,irishfield,2009-03-19 16:59:00,26272,NO FISH!!! I'm bewildered!
319302,Paully,2009-03-19 19:49:00,712,Now i understand... when you dont catch anything .. you let us in on where you're fising but when you kill it .. you leave us guessing!  :rolleyes:
319303,The Urban Fisherman,2009-03-19 20:06:00,2050,"Notice they're never in the same photo together!?!? I think the entire report is a fraud!  It's made up from old pictures.  I swear I've seen that big white boat somewhere before...     Fess up solo, you're just working on your ""street credit""."
319312,BillM,2009-03-19 20:21:00,17367," I think Mike has killed it on more then a few popular rivers  Mike and Fidel it was an absolute blast!!  Even without the fish, it was non stop laughter..  Fidel, watching you make monster casts in Owen Sound with flyline clear over the entire road inbetween cars was hilarious!!!  Next time will be reary epic!!!"
319320,solopaddler,2009-03-19 20:51:00,8605, Actually yes.
319321,BUSTER,2009-03-19 20:58:00,1336,"Since i keep getting skunked, how long before i've paid my dues???"
319322,highdrifter,2009-03-19 21:06:00,2534," I was desperate to hook into something LOL..  Something with a straight V-6 woulda been a hoot!  Great link up guys.   Maybe next week we'll get our fill..  Ya'll can have your chuckles, you'll be slobbering on your keyboards next time!"
319329,SNAGKING,2009-03-19 21:26:00,43,Looks like a great day out regardless you guys caught or not
319405,Joeytier,2009-03-20 00:59:00,3990,"Those large, huron tribs are absolutely beautiful.  I've yet to fish any of those rivers, but I'd really like to."
319425,MJL,2009-03-20 01:38:00,2427,Solopaddler takes people he doesn't like to rivers that aren't fishing well.LOL j/k  Great report and the scenery is absolutely beautiful.  Definitely would love to take a few drifts in those rivers in the near future.
319456,tinbanger,2009-03-20 02:25:00,1028,Nice report even without fish !  TB
319477,Paulus,2009-03-20 03:22:00,522,"I could've told you that HD is a cool guy. We've already had a ""man date"" and he was a perfect gentleman.   ...speaking of which, we should have a repeat, soon... with a river to go with the beer this time .  p.-"
319478,snag,2009-03-20 03:28:00,1932,"Same results locally   Sun, moon, wind direction, barometer and locusts have bamboozeled our efforts this week.  DouG Anton Billy-Curtissss  And myself, have failed.    (at least Fidel didn't hook you with crazy casts!!!)"
319495,Zebco,2009-03-20 05:03:00,123,"Great report love the pics, sorry u didn't catch alot of fish."
319499,Sinker,2009-03-20 05:23:00,8692,"This is the first report with no ""pose"".........  And here I was all excited to see the new one  Thanks for the report, looks like you fellas had some fun!  Sinker"
319516,Spiel,2009-03-20 11:45:00,9065,"Ah the all in a day fishless tour. Saugeen, Sauble, Wiarton, Oxendon, Balmy Beach, Owen Sound, Leith, Meaford, Thornbury, Craigleith and home.....been there done that.  LMAO"
