I have a few spots I will be trying, one of them being the spit. Hopefully I can run in to some pike. I would sure like to post some pictures for you guys. I read that its been pretty slow fishing for these spawning females. Anyways If you decide head down look for the only Asian angler crazy enough to fish for these toothy critters.    - Tight   L I N E S -   ! ! !"
