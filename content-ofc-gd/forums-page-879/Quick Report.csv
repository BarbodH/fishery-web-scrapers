Using small & large jerkbaits, different colour spoons(tipped with and without minnows), large minnows under a float, soft plastic jerkbaits and spinners i could not get a single pike to bite. So finally accepting what the locals told me I believed that the pike were further out at this time, but i did manage to get some rather nice size perch on the spinners while i was fishing in some of the streams. To pass the time i played around with my little Kodak digital camera and took some decent pictures.  River I Fished:   Lure:         Well we had a great time and most importantly i was glad to see my grandmother to be in good health as she is 100 years old going on 101 later this summer. Next on the list is sucker fishing"

319810,richyb,2009-03-21 00:33:00,774,I think i know why you didnt get any pike.. You reel with the wrong hand !!!! haha just kidding buddy. I bet you  had fun just chucking some lures and finaly being able to fish.
319814,danbouck,2009-03-21 00:37:00,4380,Nice pics! Glad to hear your Grandmother is doing well at 100.
319841,Greencoachdog,2009-03-21 01:25:00,8163,"If you didn't catch any fish... it was because you don't deserve any!!!  I didn't deserve any for about 6 weeks!, but I kept making sacrifices to the fishing gods of time, minnows, and tackle!  I have just now begun to be rewarded with fish again... you must appease the fishing gods!!!"
319845,Sinker,2009-03-21 01:29:00,8692," I dunno about that.......maybe you reel with the wrong hand?? Beat this, I cast AND reel with the same hand.......I bet ya can't do that   Hey, at least you were trying. Better than sitting here wishing you were fishing!! Thanks for the report, and great pics!  Sinker"
319847,Bernie,2009-03-21 01:29:00,3190,Very good pictures Mike. Enjoyed them very much. Well thought out and interesting. Congratulations to your Grandmother too.
319871,ozaibak1,2009-03-21 02:14:00,401,"It's funny, I shoot left and cast left even though I'm right-handed. Congrats to your grandma on makin it that age you should have some good genes which is a part, but more importantly the healthy lifestyle learned! I'm no pike fishing pro but I think there's a few factors to consider that could help you: size of bait (I think it may be too large considering the time of year its cold), I don't think the pike are very active now sloooooooow presentation is what I've gathered from various articles and posts, but GREAT PICTURES, nice camera angles you got the touch  you'd be surprised how few ppl know how to take a basic picture!"
319876,ozaibak1,2009-03-21 02:15:00,401,"Hmmm considering how shallow you're fishing, if possible I'd recommend a floater and run a minnow just a foot underneath, could be the ticket what do you think fellow board members, are pike still sluggish to chase a faster presentation?"
319878,ozaibak1,2009-03-21 02:17:00,401,"I like your enthusiasm for fishing btw Mike, it reminds me of mine but I had little means to get out on the water, that has luckily continued to improve since I caught the hook!"
319927,Tarzan's Jane,2009-03-21 11:52:00,1183,Nice of you to spend some time with your grandma - 100!!  wow that's special.  And nice pics btw..... I too like the one of your rod and its reflection.
