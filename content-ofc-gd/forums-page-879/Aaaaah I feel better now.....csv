318625,JeffBornFishin,2009-03-17 23:07:00,260,Well done Bly  nice first '09 fish
318660,Paulus,2009-03-17 23:53:00,522,"All is also right with the universe, with Bly and Cliff in their rightful domains ...  Glad you got into one, Bly. First of many!  p.-"
318661,Paulus,2009-03-17 23:53:00,522," Yeah, I think Guelph is Grand!  p.-"
318662,Paulus,2009-03-17 23:55:00,522," Awesome teamwork! Let us know how you did, ok?  p.-"
318679,Bly,2009-03-18 00:28:00,1556,"Thank you everyone for your kind words and not just about the fish    Thanks!   After this long winter, I just might have to revisit ice fishing   Tell you what Glen, next time I catch one I will email you the pic first and then you can tell me how long it is before I post    Ummm, How shall I say this.......There will not be a report....."
318687,ccmtcanada,2009-03-18 00:38:00,7971, Hey now!!! I caught more fish than Bly did tonite!!!  Here's a picture of the smaller of the two.  The BIIIG one was about 3 inches longer!!!  
318688,TJQ,2009-03-18 00:40:00,7806,You go girl!!  Nice!
318689,TJQ,2009-03-18 00:40:00,7806, I didnt realize your hands were the size if a giants!
318823,canadian_copper,2009-03-18 12:07:00,925,ATTA GIRL!! WELL DONE!!!
318833,Spiel,2009-03-18 12:46:00,9065,Good job Carole. I am however having a difficult time believing Cliff caught the one in the picture he posted.
318868,Bly,2009-03-18 15:05:00,1556,   
319251,ccmtcanada,2009-03-19 16:48:00,7971,I KNOW that's a photoshopped picture....  I'd never paint my nails red.........  
319479,snag,2009-03-20 03:32:00,1932,"Hmmmmmm,    (nails match the lipstick Cliffolita?)"
319513,Spiel,2009-03-20 11:29:00,9065,   What color do you paint them Cliff?
319556,Bly,2009-03-20 14:12:00,1556,"  Ok, since he is on the road and cannot stop me......    He prefers the darker pinks for the walleye, purples for steelhead..."
319588,fishnsled,2009-03-20 15:30:00,3520, 
319938,Spiel,2009-03-21 13:04:00,9065," I gotta ask, what color does he prefer for road trips...."
318279,Bly,2009-03-17 01:44:00,1556,"The last fish I caught was back in mid November of LAST year!  This long winter has been brutal...and it today I got an opportunity to head out.  Cliff suggested that when he got home from work to take off...he'd feed the family and take care of things on the home front!  So, with that in mind, I got all my steelhead gear together and waited for him to arrive at home.  He got home just after 5pm, and 2 minutes later I was out the door...LOL.  I headed down to the local trib and found a nice spot to drift.  The waters looked pretty good...not ideal, but not too bad.  Started out using jigs but nothing was taking the bait and I switched up and began to use roe.  Sure enough, that did the trick.  I was trying to get into my groove, when my float went down!! I set the hook, felt the tug on the other end.  Few flips at the surface and the fish got off!  I knew there were fish in the area, so I was determined to systematically work this hole.  A few hits and a missed hookset...I was rusty to say the least!  Finally, my float went down again...I was determined not to mess this one up!  Quick hook set and that was it!  Fish on!  This fish tried going every direction out of the hole, but I managed to turn it around each time, and finally I was able to land my first fish of 2009....and my first in 4 months!!  Here it is...a nice 28"" steelhead...  Ahhh....all is right in the world again....   Sorry team, it doesn't beat our current trout...maybe next time!  Waters were rising and the sun was setting, decided it was best to be safe and head home, wasn't easy knowing there were probably a few more fish there."
318281,kemper,2009-03-17 01:46:00,2232,These reports are killing me!  why I moved to Guelph I will never know....  ah well back from school on the weekend  sweet fish
318282,douG,2009-03-17 01:48:00,2693,"Atta Grrl, Carole.  Showing how to be fierce."
318313,irishfield,2009-03-17 02:24:00,26272,Good to see you out my dear...
318314,jwl,2009-03-17 02:24:00,1056,"aha, you almost got me..I see you are gonna be like TroutnMuskyHunter this year too eh..I will catch one, get us on the board, then you guys will beat it  way to go, nice fish..we're tied"
318316,BillM,2009-03-17 02:27:00,17367,Nice fish Bly!!!
318317,MJL,2009-03-17 02:27:00,2427,Awesome job on that fish Carole!  4 months without getting a fish is roughâ€¦I know the feeling.  I guess the nightly ritual of out-fishing Cliff begins.LOL
318321,solopaddler,2009-03-17 02:35:00,8605,"Nice clean looking fish Carole!  I've said it before Cliff but you're a lucky guy.  The thought of Joanne waiting for me at home so she could shoot out the door steelheading is pretty cool. So is winning the lottery, getting struck by lightning and getting that pony I've always wanted for Christmas.  None of them are ever going to happen."
318322,Leecher,2009-03-17 02:36:00,7832,"Great report and pic Bly  Got to feel good after the long drought and being able to land this beaut.... WTG girl You got to get out more on the hard surface and not wait for so long to get into some action.... by the looks of it, you'd make a killing!!  Good on Cliif for holding the fort!!  Congratulations again and thanks for sharing! Leechman"
318334,douG,2009-03-17 02:55:00,2693,"You've always wanted a pony?  I'm more along the lines of a Red Rider BB Gun.  Cliff and Carole have the whole dang thing going on, nice folks too."
318339,Joey,2009-03-17 03:15:00,9122,"Nice fish Carole, that Cliff is a keeper for sure  Joey"
318341,silverstreak,2009-03-17 03:20:00,146,Nice Fish Bly
318343,jwl,2009-03-17 03:24:00,1056,alright put away the BB gun.......  you'll shoot your eye out....eye out...eye out...........
318359,motv8tr,2009-03-17 06:13:00,2587,"Good to see you were able to get out Carol, and the fish is a nice bonus .... here's to many more  Maureen"
318366,Roy,2009-03-17 10:09:00,13728,And you SHOULD feel better Carole. That's a great catch. I can see a lot more of those beauties coming in now. Congrats to you!
318375,Greencoachdog,2009-03-17 12:14:00,8163,Excellent fish to break the dry spell with Miss Bly!!!  ... I swear that fish looks like a 30 incher to me!
318381,John,2009-03-17 12:32:00,2956,Nice one Carole!
318389,Victor,2009-03-17 12:51:00,1609,it's been a while since we've seen one of bly's reports!  congrats on the 1st of 09!

318408,limeyangler,2009-03-17 13:34:00,5204,"WTG Bly, nice looking fish, worth the wait....say hi to Cliff from me....good man sorting out the home front!"
318526,snag,2009-03-17 18:23:00,1932,"Well done Carole,  Good to see you out again.  Cliff needs to stay at home a little more and end his Patriarchal control.  "
318527,ccmtcanada,2009-03-17 18:26:00,7971,"Grant...I have no control at home.  Any control I 'think' I have is merely a mirage.  Thanks all for saying I'm a good hubby/dad for staying at home with the little one....but before you make any judgements, I'm heading out there late afternoon today, with Bly staying at home....LOL."
318529,Bernie,2009-03-17 18:31:00,3190,"Well done Carole! Nice fish.  My wife likes to fish too. But only if.......it's calm, no storms coming, it's sunny, the fish are biting, no bugs, ........shall I go on?"
