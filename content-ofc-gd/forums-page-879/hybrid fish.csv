319326,GBW,2009-03-19 21:22:00,8460,not sure but something tells me that this one will never spawn...  
319356,Burtess,2009-03-19 23:14:00,901, This is not necessarily true.  Some hybrids are able to reproduce.  For example closely related cichlids (same family) can be spawned to produce fertile young.  IE:  convict cichlid X sajica cichlid produce fertile young which can reproduce with themselves or with others in the same family.  An example of sport fish hybrids that are viable are splake.  The splake backcross is the result of an F1 splake male being crossed with a female lake trout (75% lake trout and 25% brook trout).  Burt
319427,MJL,2009-03-20 01:43:00,2427,Last year I caught a carp/goldfish hybrid.  Later in the season I saw large goldfish spawning within the mass orgy of carp where I caught it.    Not sure if carp/goldfish hybrids can spawn successfully...I wouldn't be surprised if they did considering all the ornamental types of goldfish available on the market.
