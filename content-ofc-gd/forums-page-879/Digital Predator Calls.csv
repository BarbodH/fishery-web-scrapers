320013,fishinfool,2009-03-21 19:01:00,366,Correct me if I am wrong but aren't electronic calls illegal for hunting? I took the turkey course last year and I seem to recall them saying that.
320021,bassjnkie,2009-03-21 20:01:00,1101,"It's legal for predators. From what I learned, you can't use it for turkey, deer or moose and others. Unless they changed the law."
320050,AzuluSpookd,2009-03-21 22:08:00,348,"They are illegal for turkey.  You are allowed to use them for Deer and Moose.  The Johnny Stewart ones are great, as ch312 stated.  I just recently started using them for predators, anything from an injured jack or cottontail...however...I bought some new hand calls for the rabbits and they are absolutely amazing.  If I had the extra money laying around, I'd buy the Johnny Stewart."

I think I am going to try to get her into BPS as they seem to have a good selection.  Thanks for the input and replies!"
