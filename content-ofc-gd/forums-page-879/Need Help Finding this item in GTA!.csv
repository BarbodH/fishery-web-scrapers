318915,Roy,2009-03-18 18:36:00,13728,"I don't think that hook keepers are all they're cracked up to be. For a large bait they're next to useless. For small(er) baits just thread a small tie-wrap through a split ring of appropriate size then tighten the tie-wrap anywhere you like. Lots use their rod guides for hook keepers but I won't. Guides are made to have line running freely through them, not as an anchor....even the good quality ones are too easy to scratch, bend, etc... The tie-wrap system works even better if you can put it on your reel without messing anything up. Some folks with baitcasting rods drill a hole in the fingergrip."
318918,mbac31,2009-03-18 18:46:00,904,I dont think that you will find anyone that carries them here. I bought mine from states side.
319007,FUSION,2009-03-18 22:45:00,81,You can get the Fugi folding hook keeper at angleing specialties for a buck I think but you will need them to wrap it on for a couple bucks extra.
319017,NANUK,2009-03-18 23:14:00,797,"Basspro in Vaughn Mills has them, I have bought them there."
319042,JohnF,2009-03-19 00:26:00,3494,A few outfits package rubber rings that roll over the butt. 2 or 3 for a few bucks. I use them on a few rods and they work fine. I bought some at Bass Pro last year I think. Dick's Sports has 'em down in the States.  I'm heading down to the States in a few weeks. Let me know and I'll pick some up for you if you can't find 'em.  JF

319792,JeffBornFishin,2009-03-20 23:55:00,260,Go to the hardware store and get a small pack of surface mount ( uv resistant) black cable ties.  Works wonders and its cheap
