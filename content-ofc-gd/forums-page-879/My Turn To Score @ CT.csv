319245,darsky,2009-03-19 16:17:00,586,With the dollar behind 25+ points I ruled out Cabelas or Bass Pro for a new bow mount. Looked locally and could not find what I wanted-12v/55lb/50+ inch shaft. Went to CT webite and searched Minn Kota and they list one with the same criteria. Got the part# and called a local store to check stock.They said they have one but it is regular selling stock and would not offer me a deal-659.00.But he goes on to tell me that another store 20 mins away has one that does NOT sell and are liquidating it for 439.00. ALL RIGHT. I get there manage to get it to the cash and it scans 399.00. Bonus. Does anyone have a V2 PD with any input?

The foot pedal has a bit of getting used to.  I gotta admit, I pick it up sometimes and use my hands, lol"
