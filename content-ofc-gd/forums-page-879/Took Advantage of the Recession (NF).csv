319955,Tybo,2009-03-21 15:12:00,1373,"STOP WITH THE HORROR STORIES!!!! Telling me about ,how you have this van and you aren't have any problems with it. What am I suppose too do?"
319959,ohhenrygsr,2009-03-21 15:38:00,947, Yea well i use to love GM my dad has always loved GM our last GM car lasted 380 000.

GM made them outta plastic the replacement that i got is Metal here is the link to the class action lawsuit http://www.merchantlaw.com/gmmanifoldgasket.html
319144,Ron,2009-03-19 10:50:00,1683,Nice ride Joey. I can see putting a trailer hitch on that puppy and having a place to snooze in on the weekend trips this summer.
319146,Bly,2009-03-19 10:52:00,1556,"Congratulations Joey and Paul!  Nice looking ride with lots of space, like the decal"
319164,corvette1,2009-03-19 12:25:00,1765,congrats nice ride
319171,Beans,2009-03-19 12:43:00,3339,That Paul guy spoils you...Gonna have to have a talk to him...Just kidding...  Sweet lookin' ride...Enjoy !!!
319181,holdfast,2009-03-19 13:00:00,1813,"Lets see, choice, VAN OR SUV  Think Ill go for the van as it is at least $15,000 cheaper than an SUV Why -Price -Room -It'll tow -ground clearance, Most SUVs are the same, off roading- dont do much so the price is more important - keeping up with the Jones next door- who cares they can have their SUV as the money I saved will pay for mortgage and gas - Hey I can even sleep in it without pitching a tent the next time I roll into a lake at 0  Dark  thirty"
319182,BillM,2009-03-19 13:00:00,17367," I thought that looked like an 8, lol...  I haven't had any issues with the 3-4 vehicles in my family that have the 3800 Series II engines.   One of the best GM's made."
319188,Spiel,2009-03-19 13:19:00,9065,Good golly Miss Joey we're going to look good driving around in that!
319195,fishnsled,2009-03-19 13:44:00,3520,You're reading my mind Carole.  LOL!  Congrats on the new van!!
319196,LeXXington,2009-03-19 13:45:00,1928,"Excellent new ride, they say the GM products built in the last 3 years are the best they ever produced.  (pittly about the years before)  Enjoy"
319198,Joey,2009-03-19 13:51:00,9122,"Thank again all.  I'm pretty happy with it!!  BTW, for those interested, I got that decal at BPS.  They had lots more.  We usually put one on our vehicle so when we go to the parking lot at a mall and there are 50 million mini vans, we can figure out which one is ours  Joey"
319202,lew,2009-03-19 13:59:00,12766,Very very nice Joey.  Springtime and new cars just sorta seem to go together
319261,Tybo,2009-03-19 17:02:00,1373,"Myself, wanted to get the G8. But the sales man told me the 2010s are come out with more ponys."
319263,ccmtcanada,2009-03-19 17:05:00,7971,WOO HOO!! Great looking new ride!  Congrats guys.
319266,tinbanger,2009-03-19 17:23:00,1028,"Good bang for the Buck ! Enjoy  We have an 99 Venture van ( chev) with almost 300,000 km on it , still goin although I don't know for how long ! Plan on driving it to the wreckers!  TB"
319580,Lunker777,2009-03-20 15:07:00,866," You must have been the one in a million that has a problem with the 3800 engine. The average warranty cost on a 3800 series engine is about .27 cent s a year. The engine is ABSOLUTLEY bullet proof, its so good that GM has decided to stop makin them in the next year or so, they arent making them money with repairs, because they last so long.  Every person Ive ever talked to with a 3800 series loved them. I know a guy with about 400,000 KMS on his from 1989 and he hasnt done ANYTHING to the engine.   Congrats on the new Van, nothing like drivin off the lot in a new ride !!!"
319662,JohnF,2009-03-20 19:11:00,3494,I've had two of the GM vans something like that (Venture and an Olds) and in 8 years had absolutely no problems.  JF
319720,outllaw,2009-03-20 21:26:00,1232,thank you for buying north american. hope to see you folks down here on st clair
319729,vance,2009-03-20 21:50:00,719,We have 5 of these vans at my work that are used to shuttle people around so we can move the fleet (car rental company) to different branches.They are 07-08s which is the same as what you have.The one with the least mileage has 189000 and the most has 275000.Other than brakes -tires-oil changes there have been NO problems. You can believe me when I say these poor things have been ABUSED their whole lives.EXCEPT when I am driving  vance
319760,Mattones,2009-03-20 22:55:00,587,Congrads on the new van  looks great!

318969,Joey,2009-03-18 21:32:00,9122,My mom pointed out an ad in the paper last week for a brand new 2009 Pontiac SV6 for under 15K.  Our 1999 Plymouth Voyager was on a downward spiral so Paul and I headed over and took a look and enquired about a trade in on the van.  Monday I drove away in this beauty.            Have you ever seen a prettier engine ???      I'm very happy with the drive of this vehicle.  I don't like cars because I'm used to the van and truck and like sitting up high. The 240 HP motor is a bonus.  She flies  I'm so spoiled    It smells like brand new car  Thanks hon!  Joey
318971,Terry,2009-03-18 21:35:00,14456,nice looking vehicle
318973,e-z-out,2009-03-18 21:35:00,1052,nice looking van Joey now when you taking it on the ice for some ice fishing lol

318986,Joey,2009-03-18 22:04:00,9122,"Thanks guys!  Ya Wayne, we ended up getting the 7 year extended transferrable warranty also.  I travel about 6kms to work each day so no way I'll ever go over in kms.  They even have a ""parking lot ding"" warranty, free for 3 months.  Plus one year of Onstar and an onboard hands free phone with 130 minutes free."
318992,misfish,2009-03-18 22:17:00,29133,"Hands free,not my kinda thing.LOL  Great buy J.  Betty got here Focus just under the extended warrenty too and took advantage of it.120km or 7 yrs.  Enjoy.    I see it didnt take long to get the decal on the new ride ."
319001,TJQ,2009-03-18 22:36:00,7806,Good deal!!
319002,GeorgeJ,2009-03-18 22:38:00,207,"Wow great deal, now is the time to buy before prices start heading up. My Dad has a 2004 Montana I think that is the predecessor of your new van and it still looks and drives like new."
319006,FUSION,2009-03-18 22:42:00,81,"Nice van. For anybody else in the market Applewood Chevy/Cadillac has the Chevy version of that van on for $13,500 cash purchase brand new. They have about 7 of them lined up out front with the $13,500 price plastered accross the front."
319010,jediangler,2009-03-18 22:55:00,1923,Congrats on the new ride. Now all you need are his and hers kayaks on the roof.
319020,Joey,2009-03-18 23:18:00,9122," Yes, I believe they are called the Upland.  I opted for the SV6 because of the tinted windows and floor mats and a few other extra's for $500 more."
319039,tschirk,2009-03-19 00:15:00,261,"Nice Ride. They tow pretty well too...It was the 1st vehicle (2 vehicles ago now...wow) I ever used, to haul my 3,000lbs boat&trailer (& yes I did have the tow pkg) Congrats! Ted"
319041,Tarzan's Jane,2009-03-19 00:24:00,1183,"Does Tybo have a brother?      kidding, just kidding.  I buy the New Car smelly things...  Nice Joey...congrats."
319044,BillM,2009-03-19 00:40:00,17367,3800 Series engines are bullet proof...  Good choice!
319064,Greencoachdog,2009-03-19 01:41:00,8163,"Beautiful vehicle Hosette!!!  The only thing that I see it needs is a ""Fish Nekkid"" bumper sticker!!!"
319079,ohhenrygsr,2009-03-19 02:23:00,947,Well it's a 3900 series the 3800 series are complete garbage biggest problem with them from 1997-2002 are Intake Manifold Gaskets trust me i've done mine on my Pontiac Montana the 3900 series engine have a problem with the Head gaskets.  Awesome GM products lol hope your's hold up
319080,Squid,2009-03-19 02:26:00,1656,Sweet!!!!!
319089,bow slayer,2009-03-19 02:35:00,1074,"good thing you got the extended warranty you will need it. I have had one for 2 years now and if not for the warranty I would have spent about 3 grand on it.It has a lot of issues and once the warranty is gone so is it. I hope you have better luck with yours ,hopefully they have improved since the 07 model."
319098,Bernie,2009-03-19 02:48:00,3190,Nice looking van Joey. They do have a nice ride and they handle OK too. I know what you mean about seating position too. Don't care for driving a car anymore either. Well unless it was a late 60's Chevelle SS.
319125,Mike the Pike,2009-03-19 03:54:00,3421,Very nice van Joey .So when are the triplets due
