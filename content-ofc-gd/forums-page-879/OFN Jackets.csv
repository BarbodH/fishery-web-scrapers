319771,TJQ,2009-03-20 23:27:00,7806, Ill see if I can come up with a style that has yellow....
319827,misfish,2009-03-21 01:01:00,29133,I wont buy a yella one.Stands out to much.L M A O
319833,Greencoachdog,2009-03-21 01:14:00,8163, What's yer point???... yer already a sore thumb!!!
319836,ChrisK,2009-03-21 01:22:00,2772,"Hey TJ, It would be nice to see a full sized Ontariofishing.net  logo on the back of the jackets whatever color or style they may be...I would even pay more for it !!!!"
319855,nautifish,2009-03-21 01:37:00,1416,Leather & bright pink to match my Hat and booties....
319931,Tarzan's Jane,2009-03-21 12:05:00,1183,"Maybe this is a given that the jackets would have side pockets and so I prefer to have closures on them....not too crazy about Velcro but a zipper or snaps would be nice.   And the collar on the jacket, if made out of nylon, would be more comfy for me if it had a softer material sewn onto it.  Or...I could just wear a scarf too...no biggy.  A matching OFC scarf would finish it off quite nicely."
320000,misfish,2009-03-21 17:21:00,29133," Hey,WAS I TALKING TO YOU REDNECK.LOL"
319378,TJQ,2009-03-20 00:18:00,7806,"This will help me narrow down the choices.  Based on Material, Colour, and Quality.  The jacket would have the logo on the front."
319396,ccmtcanada,2009-03-20 00:43:00,7971,"I like the nylon idea...I'd likely wear it for more of the year (layer up underneath in cooler weather), while the fleece is good for early spring or fall.  I also prefer the darker colours...mainly because when dirt gets on it, it hides it better and I don't have to have it washed all the time.  Glad you're getting them back...been wanting to buy an OFC jacket!"
319399,Joeytier,2009-03-20 00:48:00,3990,I'd definitely grab one.  Ever thought about patches for sewing on vests or tackle bag etc..?
319403,Whitespinnerbait,2009-03-20 00:56:00,2038,Nylon  Black

319413,crappiesteve,2009-03-20 01:16:00,220,"....What doe's that mean TJ,my old one is out dated  Depends what you want to change,what you thinking about changeing ,with the old style?Make it into a3in1 style orwhat?    Steve"
319430,TJQ,2009-03-20 01:49:00,7806,"This is all good input, Ill likely have a fleece and a nylon version, looks like navy blue.   Thanks for the offer Malcolm, I have a good bud up here that's been doing my stuff for years...  he does one offs for  me, and drops the stuff of so it saves me running around.  Keep the pole going I want all the input there is to get!"
319433,TJQ,2009-03-20 01:52:00,7806, I have patches..
319436,GeorgeJ,2009-03-20 01:56:00,207,I'd really like one in fleece and in camouflage! Yeahh Baby!
319437,kickingfrog,2009-03-20 01:57:00,8333,Dark colours = more mosquitos
319438,xeon,2009-03-20 02:01:00,350," I change my mind, I want camo. Preferable Real Tree HD, or even snowcamo for ice fishing. Or fleece in black."
319440,tinbanger,2009-03-20 02:01:00,1028,"Nylon , navy blue  got more fleece than I need already .  PrOper fit ( loNg enough sleeves) is usually the probLEm I see with the cheaper jackets. would pay the higher amount to get a jacket that fits  TB"
319441,Joey,2009-03-20 02:03:00,9122,"I agree, dark colours are no good, you need light, especially if it is sunny, you'll cook in dark.  Joey"
319455,irishfield,2009-03-20 02:24:00,26272,If it's that warm and sunny I'd be wearing my Colombia UV30 shirt !
319471,walleyemaster,2009-03-20 02:59:00,325,XXL please
319485,bigugli,2009-03-20 03:39:00,6138,  Definately biggie sized
319487,snag,2009-03-20 03:42:00,1932,"Can I pay extra for:  ""Jack of all fish, master of none""  on mine?    BTW, where's ""shocking pink""???"
319514,Spiel,2009-03-20 11:34:00,9065,Navy blue for a coat I'll wear fishing.....ah no! Camo....
319527,Greencoachdog,2009-03-20 12:37:00,8163,Canadian camo would be white eh?
319535,Handlebarz,2009-03-20 13:09:00,3790,I still like the old ones they sure do turn heads when there are a bunch of ya around and it makes it easier to find the M&G group any place.  On a side note I will not be able to get a new one for some time but do like the idea of nylon I still like the yellow.  And yes Boys they do make these Jackets to fit us all with lots of extra room.  
319586,LeXXington,2009-03-20 15:25:00,1928,What ever you pick (except for hot pink) I am in for one
319669,misfish,2009-03-20 19:22:00,29133,"Camo,in the grey / white"
319717,Rich Clemens,2009-03-20 21:11:00,3131,"If we choose nylon ... can you throw in a matching set of stockings ?   pink maybe ?  Personally, I liked the yellow ones that I've seen folks wearing.   They do kinda stand out."
