319022,misfish,2009-03-18 23:27:00,29133,  Oh Im drooling.
319062,hammercarp,2009-03-19 01:32:00,964,Well into the 70's you spear pike here. Lots of people along the Lake Erie shore did it.
319112,ozaibak1,2009-03-19 03:06:00,401,"Great video thanks a lot for posting, and interesting way to 'fish' for sure!"
319984,Squid,2009-03-21 16:40:00,1656,"I find nothing wrong with this. Folks needed to eat so they speared the fish or shot them. Its tradition and leagal so all is good. There were a few segments where you actually see a DNR officer measuring the fish. When I was a kid, I would use a bow and arrow to pluck the carp that managed to stay land locked in Laval sur le lac golf course. The river-rapids would overflow st.rose blvd every year and if we did not take out the fish, they would die as the water dried out. My mother had a knack of making any species ogenerously proportionedish taste awesome. Our father would also take us to an island in pte. Calumet to take out the pike that came in and spawned and ended up land locked as the water receded. It was crazy and insane, there would be hundreds of pike stuck in the swamp. We would actually get bumped by the fish as they swam past us. I believe that we used spears to fish them out. We harvested what we needed and left the rest to mother nature. This activity took place in the 60's. It was always a fun time waiting for ice out so we could go and harvest these fish. Gees my father used to use a oar to smoke the carpe that went by!! Crazy Russian read neck he was!!  When I get back to MontrealI will go through the pictures and find the ones of these outings and post  them for all to enjoy!"
320015,Northhunter,2009-03-21 19:13:00,214,"Don't harp on it because it's different or you've never done it. Wait a few weeks and all the smelt threads will start.  Up here we net suckers in the spring. When I was a kid we used to go by boat up to the ""sucker chute"" - there were always people there. Now there's a house beside it - right in the middle of nowhere They net whitefish the same way up north in the fall.  The first trip to the camp every spring my grandfather used to spear pickeral (not walleye ). He grew up in Sturgeon. They would go out to an island in the middle of the channel and take a couple every year. If they had to, they'd use a strip of birch bark to draw them in near the rocks by shore. He mentioned they used to take a female, tie it to a line and bring it in towards shore. The smaller males or ""bucks"" would group up and follow her in and those were the ones they would spear. When they did it at the camp it was 2 or 3 fish a year (if they made it out), for lunch the next day. It wasn't poaching - it was just something they did that was accepted at the time.  When I was young he told my dad he should take me out - my dad basically told him ""It's different now. You can't do that anymore"". There's still a couple spearheads in the shed.  During the summer it was common practice to take the canoe and the .22 out to the weedbeds for frog legs. If we did that now...  It's easy to knock on something that you've never experienced."
320016,Northhunter,2009-03-21 19:15:00,214,Forgot to add - thanks for the vid!!!  I liked how the one guy compared fish mounts to a rock 'n' roll song.

318648,Leecher,2009-03-17 23:39:00,7832,"I think that's the most dangerous sport there is Just the thought of aiming and shooting at the water to get a fish with a high caliber riffles is enough to give me a heart attack  If it's a tradition in their part of the country, so be it but I'd rather leave the magnum home and take out the good old rod for this task.

318650,JeffBornFishin,2009-03-17 23:41:00,260,OK repeat after me...I love Canada.

318658,Roy,2009-03-17 23:49:00,13728,"Thanks for sharing the video. I thought it was entertaining. It's only 45 miles from me and I've seen it up close. Hell, half those folks have the same last name as me. I know that it wouldn't sit right in very many other places but you still do have to try to understand them."
318663,Terry,2009-03-17 23:55:00,14456,"I have known about it for years, it's tlegal there so why not  in ontario we use crossbows for carp  I don't see any difference .. It's not for me, but it's legal so have fun"
318673,bigredfisher,2009-03-18 00:06:00,300,that's not fishing!!!!
318676,Roy,2009-03-18 00:08:00,13728, I don't think the word fishing was spoken anywhere.
318685,irishfield,2009-03-18 00:37:00,26272,Nope.. and why they need a hunting licence !  Don't imagine it hurts the population too much... suspect many miss thanks to the optics issue.
318694,Daplumma,2009-03-18 00:49:00,1961,"In West(by God) Virginia it is legal to shoot carp but only with a shotgun.Here in Virginia you have to use a bow to get them suckers and have either a fishing OR hunting license.I have a bud that runs owns a Japanese restaurant that will take every Carp he can get.  Say what you will,its legal,the fish was not wasted and it was much harder than throwing out corn and boilies. Joe"
318695,Roy,2009-03-18 00:57:00,13728,* makes mental note to not eat sushi in Virginia NOR West (by God) Virginia.*

It's not my cup of tea but each to his own, not my position to say good or bad as it's happening in another country and not my business. Betcha the P3ta crowd stays along way away from those guys for fear of getting their asses speared.   Hey great idea! a P3ta season!"
318822,OhioFisherman,2009-03-18 11:59:00,6623,How could they keep that and do away with the traditional public executions?
318824,holdfast,2009-03-18 12:07:00,1813,"Wow, Brings back good memories, (My Best) when we were all a family together as kids in Vermont.  Peanuts (a prince of an old man) maybe with the same last name as Yours Roy, is it French? decided to shoot some Carp that entered the flooded back field from lake Champlain.  I never seen fish so Big in my life, that swam around and around with its dorsal fins just above the surface like a shark.  Ole Peanuts about four foot nothing decided he was going to shoot these Carp with his Double Barrel shot gun.  I was an awestruck 8 year old watching this guy blasting a Carp to Obliteration with me standing beside him.  Wow, a Huge explosion of water no more than ten feet from me and ole Peanuts just about landed on his aasss.  Funny though, I always wondered where the Carp went as they completely disappeared from the Back field.  One of these Days Ill tell you a story when Ole Peanuts scared the crap out of me on the Drive to help him cut grass at his Hunting Camp.  I thought I was going to die"
318949,misfish,2009-03-18 20:05:00,29133,"Did you all know, that they drag ,LIVE ,dogs, through boiling tanks in China? This make for easy skinning, as theres none left when they come out.  There are many ways for many things at many places in this world. Wrong??????? Maybe to some,but not to others.  That was an educating post."
