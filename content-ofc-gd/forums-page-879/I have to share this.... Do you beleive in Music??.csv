319352,Muskieman,2009-03-19 23:08:00,2472,I found this video to be very moving for some reason ...  http://vimeo.com/moogaloop.swf?clip_id=2539741   What does it do for you?    RFS

319360,Tarzan's Jane,2009-03-19 23:23:00,1183,I've always loved that song. When I hear it...I think of my very best friend of 25 years...she truly has stood by me and I by her. Great video...thanks for sharing.
319364,holdfast,2009-03-19 23:36:00,1813,"Still not working maybe because of my antivirus protection.   Whats the name of the song or video, maybe its on U-tube"
319367,walleyejigger,2009-03-19 23:48:00,876,bunch of different ppl/groups from different countries singing/playing stand by me   very cool
319368,Muskieman,2009-03-19 23:48:00,2472,  here ya go I hope this works...      RFS
319369,moose,2009-03-19 23:51:00,266,great video and song
319379,holdfast,2009-03-20 00:22:00,1813," Yea neat video, liking the Grandpa"
319382,douG,2009-03-20 00:27:00,2693,"For some who can't see the video, it is a bunch of bands, from everywhere on this earth, playing the same song in synch, maybe on a multi location live link.  Very cool.  The idea might have been served better by a multinational rendition of 'One Love, One Heart', but that is so cheezy,  and it would look like a Pepsi commercial. 'Stand by Me' is the better tune.   Hopeful is the message.  I like hopeful.  Lead or follow, or get out of the way."
319389,jediangler,2009-03-20 00:34:00,1923,Great tune. This is my favourite version of that song.  
319397,gdelongchamp,2009-03-20 00:46:00,199,Excellent song and a great idea. World music on the internet. Whoever thought this up is on to something.
319660,JohnF,2009-03-20 19:03:00,3494,Nice.  I like it.
319663,misfish,2009-03-20 19:12:00,29133,"Randy, That is my all time fav of all. Brings tears for many reasons. Thanks from teary eyed grown man."
