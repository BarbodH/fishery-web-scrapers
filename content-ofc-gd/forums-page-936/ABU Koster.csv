272295,johnnyb,2008-11-26 22:09:00,3413,"Anybody know of a tackle shop that carries ABU Koster spoons?  I like the looks of them, but so far, can only find them in the UK.  They seem like a pretty good addition to the ice-fishing tackle box, but I'm trying to avoid paying more than the lure itself in shipping costs alone.  Any help is appreciated"
