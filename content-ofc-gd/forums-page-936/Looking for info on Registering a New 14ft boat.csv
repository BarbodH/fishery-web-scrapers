271997,Fisherman,2008-11-26 02:32:00,7201,"If you are purchasing it new, never registered before, yes, it's over 10HP, it requires the numbers on both sides close to the front of the hull in specified size lettering.  You would be real wise of obtain a bill of sale from the seller.  Then go to a Service Ontario location to complete the paperwork."
272015,forrest,2008-11-26 02:51:00,1032,"Fines are steep for not having the proper paper work on board.  Do a search on the forum.  -Bill of Sale is the proof of ownership.  Always keep it with the boat (and a backup copy). -Go to Services Canada and register it in your name, pay the taxes.  forrest"
272017,irishfield,2008-11-26 02:54:00,26272,Slap a 9.9 on it and live happily ever after. Heck.. even a 15 with a 9.9 cowl !  Other than that... as the boys have pointed out services canada for a Vessel Registration. If asked for it on the water and you can't produce it... $300 fine.

272147,kemper,2008-11-26 15:14:00,2232,not that I approve or anything...but my uncles buddy had a 45 with a 25 cowl...or at least the decaling from a 25 because he often fished a certain HP restricted lake.  worked for him for years
