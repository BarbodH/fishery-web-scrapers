NOT  I read today that the Ford biggies have sold off thier jets aswell to save cash. Whoop de do. Hell they even held a buffet for the ones that were losing thier jobs. JOKE   Ok I digress."

Try putting 6 or 7 companies on the plant floor in Oakville... it will never happen North of the Mexican border thanks to the UAW.  http://info.detnews.com/video/index.cfm?id=1189

The big 3 and the unions screwed us as consumers and when we take our business else where they screw us as taxpayers. A bailout regardless of concessions can never succeed when they are broken beyond repair. This has got to stop.
