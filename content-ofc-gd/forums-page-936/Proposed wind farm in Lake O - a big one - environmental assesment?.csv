272166,kemper,2008-11-26 15:39:00,2232,"Speaking of alternative power, I saw an interesting creation on a house that was hard on the shore of Lake O. Solopaddler, maybe you can chime in here as I am sure you have seen in walking to a certain trout fishing spot that you gave me. ( I have been sworn to secrecy)  It was like a watermill on a long pole that moved up and down with the waver and spun forwards and backwards as the waves moved in and out.   okay that was the worst description ever."
272189,Headhunter,2008-11-26 16:45:00,5703,"Unfortunately for Toronto, our glorious Mayor has decided that there will be no burning/incineration of Toronto waste! I think our mayor is a waste! HH"
272195,joonmoon,2008-11-26 17:06:00,528,"Any time you burn anything it will emit gases, CO2 usually is the biggest emission. Isn't CO2 the greatest factor in global warming...? Correct me if I'm wrong but a windmill doesn't have any emissions or nasty bi-products. Just pure energy, free and ready for human usage. Who cares how they look...eye-sore shmeye-sore. If the production of hydro electricity out weighs the consequenses of costs...even if it takes a decade or two to pay for it, doesn't it seem just right and ethically, morally and environmentally the thing to do. In my opinion build the windmills everywhere theres a fairly consistent breeze. They are huge and look a lot nicer than breathing in lousy polluted air from burning fossel fuels or garbage or anything for that matter. I say do just do it."
272203,Ramble,2008-11-26 17:40:00,713,"The bio digestors don't burn anything its microbial direstion that produces heat as a by product.The bacteria doing the digesting create heat. Using organic sources utalizes carbon already in the environment, not pumped from a contained source like fossil fuels. The creation of the carbon dioxide comes from burning the methane, if thats what you mean by CO2 creation. Its ""better"" for global warning then methane. Methane is 4-5 times worse in its ""green house gas"" properties then carbon dioxide propeties.CO2 is a major factor in global warming because of the burning of fossil fuels. Were adding more Carbon dioxide into the global system that wasnt already there, that's why its a problem. Incineration of garbage is the source for a whole kalidoscope of nasties, the americans are trying to deal with the emissions becuase they do it a lot more then we do here.  -R-"
272212,joonmoon,2008-11-26 18:10:00,528,I see what you're saying but wouldn't it make more enviromental sense to produce energy without producing any more greenhouse gases. Using windmills doesn't produce any...its how we choose to use the energy that can produce a bi-product. Burning methane gas for heat for example.
272217,bigugli,2008-11-26 18:22:00,6138,"Organic materials, as they decompose, will produce methane, whether we use it or not. By choosing to harness methane, as a biofuel, we are choosing the lesser of two evils. CO2 has a lesser ecological impact. Only other way to significantly diminish our output of methane, globally, would be to reduce the human population by 20%."
272230,Ramble,2008-11-26 19:01:00,713,"Depending on how you energy production depends on how you measure about the envirmental impact. Windmills can be hard on birds, there is health effects associted with low frequency emissions, and if you examin production costs. The is an environmental cost associated with the materials wind mills are made from, same with digestors. Smelting of metals, trasportation costs mantainance. There is no such thing as no-emission technology if you factor in the materials used to make them.  -R-"
272519,pikehunter,2008-11-27 13:26:00,1659,"First time I ever saw a windfarm was in southern California 1989. Pretty neat sight, come along the highway and round a hill and there were hundreds of windmills on the hill sides. I didn't look at it as an eyesore but something really neat and unexpected to see. No more of an eyesore than the CN Tower is or any other man made structure that blights the earth. If we can capture the wind and harness it why not? Hell of a lot better than nuclear or coal generated electricity."
272525,JohnF,2008-11-27 13:46:00,3494,  Haven't they been doing that in the North Sea for quite a few years now (flappers on the ocean floor that react to the ebb and flow of tides)? There should be some data available by now on it's practical functionality.  JF
272110,Ramble,2008-11-26 14:06:00,713,"I'm not on board with this wind generation story. Cost too much for too little. Biomass decomposures are looking to be one of the best bets. Decomposing organics...expired vegtables from grocery chains, specifically harvested crops, compostables and manure to generate methan to burn to create energy. They are having great success with it in Germany and it benifts argiculte as well as the environment. The stuff that doesn't reduce to methane gas at the end of the reaction is a good fertalizer. CO2 and water are emmitted. This is benificial cause methane is a worse green house gas then CO2 and majority of the methane would be produced anyway naturally. It's not a fossile fuel so the were utalizing the avaible portion of the carbon cycle....assuming then didnt use fertalizer derived from fossil fuels. ANYWAY...it's lookin really really good. Communities and farm co-ops can set up their own generation stations and this means wide spread small generation stations. Possibility for jobs here for sure. You could even do a compost collection in teh cities and reduce landfill waste by generating energy with peoples left over food. Problem is hydroone can't monopolize on this kinda technology, and therefore are playing dumb about it. hopefully someone in teh gov't gets on board and make them do it.  They are less ugly, have lesse ecological effects, and utalize a natural process that would happen anyway. Hopefully we can get more of these going in canada. They have some big ones in german up to 3GW of energy production.  Check these out for a bit of into to the technlogy. http://www.ontario-sea.org/Page.asp?PageID...p;ContentID=903  http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/7530794.stm  They are even looking at ways to use human waste to generate elecricity in these things. Imagine if we can use our millions of tonnes of sewage to power our homes! You'd solve a multitude of environmental problems at once, and we'd have a pratically never ending suppy of FUEL!!  -R-"
272118,bigugli,2008-11-26 14:22:00,6138,"Dung has been used for centuries as a primitive cooking fuel in parts of Asia. Simply apply new age tech to a primitive resource. Compost can generate more than methane. When the process is accelerated, the heat produced is phenomenal. It is not unusual for compost mounds to spontaneously combust. It's happened in my pile a couple of times. Nothing more embarassing than standing knee deep in hot garbage with a pitchfork and a hose in the middle of winter trying to put out the hot spots, while a crowd of curious neighbours look on   I had too much rabbit waste in the pile."
272126,Ramble,2008-11-26 14:33:00,713,Exactly! Some places in Eurpoe are using the heat generated as a by product to heat homes. If they get the purity of the methane high enough they pump it right into the natural gas lines.  They same process that sets ur pile on fire is the same one that makes wet hay bails combust in barns and generates the enery in these things. I forgot about the heat generation. Good Point!  -R-
