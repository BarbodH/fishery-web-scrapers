Infamous for Dagenais the Cop Killer, and not far from the Hamlet of Leoville where there was a Canadian Idol contestant and unfortunately one of our Fallen soldiers.  This Town would be Busy as it is the Biggest town between Prince Albert and North Battleford.  Also the Hub of the North, Loggers, Rednecks, First-Nations, and Ranchers.               Next Ill travel West then North through Frontier and Reservation Territorry.  Big Ranches Coyotes and beef.  Check out the Old Homesteads.  Wonder why one has a steel roof.            http://s79.photobucket.com/albums/j126/hol...Â¤t=PB210112.jpg  Through the Hamlet of Victoire and the Town of Debden then Back on the Highway to Big River.  The Pulp Mill has closed as well as Prince Albert and now Meadow Lake.  No jobs in Big River unless you work at a camp like Fort McMurray.  Lake is froze but not enough for ice Fishing          Finally my Trailer.  $9,000 for Trailer and lot.  My Boats are stored here and its my man-cave.  Ill have a few beers, tell Rodger the neighbor, hes history.  He jumped me last time, before I through him over the Balcony.  He shows up, 5 minutes after I arrive and pretends he doesn't remember nothing.  Hes a parasite anyways.  NO LOSS.  Early Sunday Back to the battlefords but first a few pics of the Poor third World First Nations peoples that I seen on the CBC     Next a detour to the Edge of the oil Patch.  Each Lease has one or two tanks plus the well. From the well oil, water, sand will go to the first drum.  Oil on the top, water, then sand on the bottom.  Oil flows to the next tank called the sales tank.  Oil and water is trucked out.  Sand is vacuumed out.  There is an environ wall around the tanks.  The well runs on either propane or the gas from the well.  Dirty , hard, long hours of work.         Next the town of Battleford on the south of the North Saskatchewan River.  Easy going town with low crime compared to North battleford across the river.      North Battleford across the river.  Complete opposite of Battleford. Baby's with babies,Drugs, alcohol, Gang wannabes, graffiti, old dumps and nice homes.  Half Indians, Half whites.          Finally Home  "
