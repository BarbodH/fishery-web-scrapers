272290,irishfield,2008-11-26 21:29:00,26272,"Seriously 24/7.. sounds a little steep. I know most marinas charge more than car dealerships.. but $80/hr is the shop rate at the marina I deal with. About par with the GM dealer that just got me for $89.95/hr to fix my '98 GMC truck. Like I said..wish I could get this to work on airplanes... not like you can pull over to the side of the road when your prop falls off....  In that price they quoted you though... there's gonna be ""shop supplies"", taxes etc on top of the $40 for seals and the bottle of lower unit oil."

272331,lew,2008-11-26 23:26:00,12767,"I needed a bit of work done on my boat this past summer and the marina quoted me $300 for a ""couple"" hours work plus parts.  Another marina quoted me $100 plus parts for the same job.  Turns out I can probably do it myself in about 90 minutes.  I'd suggest you get a couple quotes before signing on the dotted line."
272344,Fisherman,2008-11-26 23:57:00,7201,"I would tend to believe that 1 hour would be the ""worst case senario"", last I looked, remove cotter pin, nut, slide off prop, undo 2 bolts that hold in the rear seal and O ring. If they were intending to do the upper seal on the driveshaft, okay, add a bit more time for pulling the whole lower unit off."
272358,Kerry,2008-11-27 00:08:00,383,If they're doing the seals properly the bottom end has to come off and the shifter seal should be done as well as the 'O' ring on the top of the drive shaft.While it's apart might as well do the water pump too then everything is done at once.
272434,Whitespinnerbait,2008-11-27 02:17:00,2038,"Make you a deal '' Bud '' ..........pick up the parts and I'll go over and replace the seal, inspect the gears etc etc   No Charge...."
272459,Leecher,2008-11-27 03:12:00,7832,"Hey Kev,  I think you should stick with whitespinnerbait's offer..... can't go wrong on that one"
