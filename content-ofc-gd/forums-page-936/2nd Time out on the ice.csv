I'm glad i was as i hit one spot barely 3 inches...good black ice....but not a thickness i'm comfortable staying on for any length of time. it needs to get colder!!!....lol  I'm out a good 150 yards from shore....but still 50 feet short of where i caught consistently at first ice last year. But i did manage to avoid the skunk...barely....with two tiny...tiny pike.      1ST FISH OF 08-09 SEASON....LOL....TO LOOK ON THE BRIGHT SIDE , THEY CAN ONLY GET BIGGER  <embed width=""448"" height=""361"" type=""application/x-shockwave-flash"" wmode=""transparent"" src=""http://i263.photobucket.com/player.swf?file=http://vid263.photobucket.com/albums/ii158/vishuscirquel/MVI_2330.flv"">      ANOTHER TINY PIKE         STAYED TILL SUNDOWN.....NO MORE FISH...JUST A COUPLE MISSED BITES...FELT LIKE SMALL STUFF THOUGH  "

272005,Mike the Pike,2008-11-26 02:38:00,3421,Thanks for that Simon man it looks cold up there .  You should consider feeding those fish for one there too small too white if that doesn't work get some dinamite and launch the boat after you get rid of the ice
