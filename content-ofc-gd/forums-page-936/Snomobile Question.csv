272179,troutologist,2008-11-26 16:11:00,951,"Hey folks,  Im going to look at a 2000 Tundra longtrack at lunch time today and was hoping someone could throw out a few pointers on what to check out when buying a used sled. I've had a few older ones before but they were free and the condition didnt matter...  The reason Im rushing on this, is this type of icefishing sled lasts only a few hours here.  Any help is much appreciated.  Thanks"
272282,jeffw,2008-11-26 21:11:00,267,"Hey Jay, check the track for cracks and if its studded check for torn pieces where the studs were. Check the shocks to makes sure they rebound and there not cracked or dented. Last major thing is that the tunnel and heat exchangers are in good shape (they look like mini rads at the back of the tunnel) unless its fan cooled then there won't be any. Cheers jeff"
272292,trapshooter,2008-11-26 21:32:00,1234,"good advice from jeffw.  you can also run a compression test and check that all the bells/whistles like handle bar heaters, reverse etc. all work.  Ask for proof of service history as well.  you don't want to get burned due to your sense of urgency to buy.  It is true that good deals don't last long though.  Just make sure it is the right sled for you."
272361,Fisherman,2008-11-27 00:11:00,7201,"A couple of pointers I learned from my son who worked in the shop, check the radial and axial play on both clutches, in and out play and up and down play, expecially on the motor."
272446,pike slayer,2008-11-27 02:50:00,1177,"all great stuff so far, make sure theres no cracks in the clutches to, look at the motor and make sure there isnt any oil leaking out anywhere. run it and make sure there isnt any weird noises. bacisally just give it a good look over, if something doesnt appaer to look correct then its probably not. good luck! if you run into problems go to www.dootalk.com its a skidoo forum site, theres some great ppl over there."
272453,troutologist,2008-11-27 03:03:00,951,thanks for the replys guys...ended up picking it up. machine looks mint and the price was right.  should open up some new lakes beyond snowshoe distance

Gavin
272540,troutologist,2008-11-27 14:26:00,951,"Gavin, Im always interested in a good icefishing trip. Ive been limited to snowshoes for the past few years, can't wait to hit up some of the lakes I used to get into. If the tundra gets stuck I can just pick it up and carry it though...hope the lakes freeze soon  Keep in touch Jay"
