271601,msp,2008-11-25 02:41:00,1336,"Hey everybody, I have been reading everyones posts that reveiw their whole season. Very impresive.Lots of great fishermen on the site.I would also like to welcome all the new members that have recently posted some of their fish porn........Keep it coming guys!! Anyway,I dont have the time to post all the time,nor have the time to post my whole season,but I do have time to reveiw my favorite fishing month of the year.......yep you guessed.......November. Nov. 1st- decided to fish for late season largies. All bass caught on jig & pigs in 8 feet of water with sparse weeds.Water temps were hovering at 47 degrees. Heres the two bigguns of the day. Nov.8-The bass and pike bite seemed to be pretty good cosidering the cold front temperatures so we thought that we would give it another try the following weekend.Before we even loaded the boat up with our gear my buddy helped himself to a few casts of the dock. 2nd cast.........  After that we thought that it was going to be a good day. Slowrolling spinnerbaits,long paused jerkbaits and swimming jig and pigs was the ticket for a good day on the water.    I spot this fish swimming toward the boat and my buddy decided to run a figure 8 in front of him and he lunged for the bait.After we got him in the boat we realized that he was blind in both eyes, his jaw was hanging on by a thread, and he has had an ice fishing spreader rig hooked to his gills.Poor guy!!!!! I cant beleive that he has lived that long,and still feeding.   Nov.14-Decided to take the day off work cause I was starting to jones for some trout.Had a great day on the river.Landed a hand full of steelhed and a couple of bonus browns.      Nov.23-Decided to give it one last kick at the can before the boat went away for the season.Boy it was hard to get the boat started in the morning. Persistance paid off and I was rewarded with this beauty.  See ya soon guys..........Mike"
