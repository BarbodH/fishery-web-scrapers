271996,silverstreak,2008-11-26 02:31:00,146,Seems Pink isn't the only colour that works. Hit a few on some Light Pink Riverworms last week also. 
272000,kemper,2008-11-26 02:36:00,2232,"Havent had a ton of luck on the pinkies, although  I Dont give them the time they might deserve."
272002,BillM,2008-11-26 02:36:00,17367,"3"" Pink Berkley Gulp."
272052,steverowbotham,2008-11-26 04:18:00,1800,"Not a wise choice to have a favourite colour.  Use what works, I've caught em on baby pink, bright pink, natural brown and white. Depends on water clarity"
272053,steverowbotham,2008-11-26 04:19:00,1800,nice fish btw
272084,chickenhawk,2008-11-26 12:27:00,612,yeah i like white but its jus not as good as the pink....wonder what they think it is...cuz i dont know too many worms that are pink? any ideas?   Hawk
272092,bicephalic,2008-11-26 13:06:00,112, Maybe It's history all over again:  What is that? No idea!? It's disgusting! and DIFFERENT! get rid of it. what..? GET RID OF IT. Gulp...   Then again who knows what colour it shows up to under the water to a speeding trout? Maybe they think it's a string of roe stuck together and dislodged from upstream? (not quite the right colour)
272094,blaque,2008-11-26 13:21:00,2419, Ditto! I do better on them panfishing in the spring and summer than anything lol. Ive yet to hook a steelhead on one.......but its not often i give them an honest effort.
272095,ccmtcanada,2008-11-26 13:29:00,7971,"I learned the magic of pink worms from CanadianCopper.  On a day when roe wasn't working particularly well, he thew me one and wouldn't you know it, it worked.  I haven't really given other colours the time they probably deserve...but pink has to be my favourite."
272128,troutologist,2008-11-26 14:36:00,951,"This time of year pink is rudely effective for me. That said, it seems that pink is really catching on though and it not  as effective in some of the more heavily hit spots any more....time to find the new steelhead kryptonite"
272134,Paully,2008-11-26 14:49:00,712,"Just wondering... do you guys use the floating pinkies, i bought a pack a few weeks ago and just noticed it says Floating on the package! do they all float?  BTW... I've only used pink with some sucess but im sure other colours work also.."
272156,kemper,2008-11-26 15:30:00,2232, The floating ones are a real pain in the ars. The will float up to be about level with your first shot...meaning that your first shot will smack the fish in the face before the worm does.  I suppose you could bottom bouce them
272182,The Urban Fisherman,2008-11-26 16:14:00,2050,"Thanks for the report - I'm going to try rigging them on a small trout jig now as well!  Can I still use my 11' float rod when jig fishing or do I have to use a shorter rod?  I'm just a beginner when it comes to steelhead, but (as previously mentioned by blaque) they're deadly for panfish.  In the spring and early summer I fish pannies almost exclusively with pink trout worms.  They smash the pink ones and most often won't even give any other color the time of day.  You'd think panfish wouldn't be so picky.  I'll either wacky rig them under a float, or put them on a micro jig-head rigged similar to the one in your original post.  The good thing about using them rather than live worms is you can catch a dozen fish or more one one worm instead of re-baiting every time.    And if you're lucky you'll hook into a few of these little guys while you're at it....   cheers, UF"
272190,blaque,2008-11-26 16:48:00,2419," Exactumundo, and with the young ones with ya, thats critical to keeping your sanity  lol"
272193,Court R,2008-11-26 16:57:00,213,All colours will work but pick is one of my favorites.
272221,tipupesox,2008-11-26 18:35:00,167,"I second the 3"" berkley trout worm.  My friend has been slaying this Fall on pink.  I myself have no confidence in the lure, have tried pink, white and cheese color, no luck ...............  have had luck on the 2.5"" gulp split tail minnow in shad color."
272307,fishnpro,2008-11-26 22:41:00,93,"Pinkies are my go to bait when nothing else is working. Rig em wacky style and let em drift. Also I find that the berkley 3"" floating worms work better than the exude ones."
272315,silvio,2008-11-26 22:57:00,433,Pink is the only colour Iâ€™ve used and works very well for me and they guys I fish with.
