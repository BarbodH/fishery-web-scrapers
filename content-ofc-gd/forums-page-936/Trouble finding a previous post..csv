A few months or so ago, I remember reading a post by a guy ( forgot his handle ) who had built a casting deck floor into his 14' Lund. (G-Bay guy if I recall correctly). I too am looking to do the same as a winter project and I'm trying to gather as much info on doing so before I start hacking away at my 14'. I've spent the last couple of hours trying to find this post and can't seem to find it anywhere.  Any help towards what I'm speaking of would be great.  Love the site, find myself spending a lot of time here, too much time? - never! The whole auction thing blew me away with the response, and the few people I've asked for info were more then happy to help and quick. Sorry & Thanks Y'all PD"

272291,irishfield,2008-11-26 21:30:00,26272,Yep Jigger and then Gerritt did his as well.
272294,Jigger,2008-11-26 22:07:00,1237,"Appreciate the kind words guys. Don't remember what Gerrits thread was called, but mine was called Pimp my Lund. Keep a log and show us how you make out. Its definately a good way to pass the cold winter months."
