271910,steelheader42,2008-11-26 00:11:00,44,Hi thinking about heading up to Pine falls Lodge in June an again in Aug. Has anyone where stayed there before or ever fished Washagami Lake or Murray Lake l have tired to find a map of the lakes on Anglers Atlas with no luck.
271928,sturgman,2008-11-26 00:39:00,249,"I have never fished those lakes or have I ever stayed at Pine Falls Lodge but have fished surrounding areas quite a bit, heck its my backyard. I'm only a 30 minute drive from both lakes. If you are not looking to be pampered and wanna ruff it next summer, there are rustic cabins available for rent on Lake Maskinonge. There not pretty but there cheap therefor you can spend all your money on tackle for the trip."
