271874,BillM,2008-11-25 23:17:00,17367,"Well, I played hooky from work and decided to hit the Saugeen with a buddy of mine.   Morning started off well with both of us hooking into fish within the first 10 mins or so.  After that things went dead.   The flow was insane, the river is so high we are fishing holes and runs that have never been there before.  My buddy Dave got into two fish, I hooked up with one but horsed it near the end and the hook popped.  If you have ever fished the Saugeen when it's at a normal level, these pics will make you smile   I've be making notes on river conditions and the corresponding hydrometric data, I now have an idea when the go to time is for this specific place...         "
271876,solopaddler,2008-11-25 23:20:00,8605,Well done Bill. If you can fish the Saugeen successfully under those conditions you can catch 'em anywhere.
271877,BillM,2008-11-25 23:22:00,17367,"Mike, you know what?  That's exactly what my buddy said"
271879,ccmtcanada,2008-11-25 23:27:00,7971,Nice work out there!  Congrats on hooking into a few.  That river makes my steelhead creeks look like tiny little dribbles of water...wait...they are...LOL.  Great pics!
271890,BillM,2008-11-25 23:40:00,17367,"Cliff, the ditches out east don't seem to difficult compared to this monster.  Hopefully I can take a few things I've learned and see if I can turn around my streak on the Notty."
271896,tibbs,2008-11-25 23:48:00,650,Nice Job!  Great Pics too.
271900,silvio,2008-11-25 23:51:00,433,WTG Bill told you it aint as hard as people make it seem!!
271946,highdrifter,2008-11-26 01:09:00,2534,Noicely done Bill!!  You're a trooper for shticking it out.  WTG.  cheers HD
271965,jdmls,2008-11-26 01:48:00,575,"Nice fish Bill.... FYI I still get the pics from the halloween brown in your avatar, LOL.... Have to make the trek up to the saugeen again one day"
271973,Leecher,2008-11-26 01:58:00,7832,Great report and pics Bill  Kudos to both of you and thanks for sharing Leechman
272103,NAC,2008-11-26 13:35:00,369,"Nice looking fish!  Those real-time charts will serve you well and you'll just get better at figuring it out the more times you look at them.  I tend to store a copy that includes two days before and two days after each outing, to give me a better picture what was going on."
272113,splashhopper,2008-11-26 14:16:00,2931,nice fish. I fish the Maitland alot and can identify with the size of the Saugeen vs the little toilet trinkles from Eastern Lake Ontario !  lol
272219,ehg,2008-11-26 18:32:00,2666,"Nice report and pictures there Bill! Those fish are insane scrappers, sure beats those little speckled trout. (specks have their time) Good to see you doing so well with those. ehg"
272248,BillM,2008-11-26 19:40:00,17367,"Eric, I am really looking forward to the spring,  I have a soft spot for brookies  Maybe this time we'll find some creeks with water in them? lol"
272256,ketchenany,2008-11-26 19:52:00,3229,"Yes Bill the Geen is one hell of a cold place at this time of year. When we were young and stupid, we'd make that trek during the week after doing an 8 hour midnight shift (just like in the article I sent you, and we were those loogans) One time I built a huge fire on shore got my self warmed up, when it was noticed it cleared the river and I went fishing  all by myself and managed to get one before they came back.  NIce looking fish.  A"
272258,BillM,2008-11-26 19:53:00,17367,Thanks Al... I still plan on making my way up to the places mentioned in the article  I wish I could convince you to tag along!
