271958,purekgw,2008-11-26 01:31:00,585,"ok well im heading down to P.E.I for the summer for work and want to do some fishing the last time i was  down there i was  catching ghaspero (weird little things look like bass but teeth like piranhas) , mackerel and brook trout. But i was talking to some one that said there where striped bass out there but he never really said where to catch them. Im only going to have a kayak to fish out of and dont want to be paddling into the middle of the ocean for mackerel.  So has any one fished for them if so can u lend some advise do they stay close to shore, what do the eat?"
271976,bigugli,2008-11-26 02:02:00,6138,"They run into certain tribs in the maritimes, and the St. Lawrence,  fall to spring for the spawn. Beyond that they are an offshore fish."
271990,superdad,2008-11-26 02:22:00,353,"Take a spinning rod / some line / and a bunch of Daredevils and find some piers and the right tide and start casting, the 'tinker'mackeralwill give you a thrill."
271995,purekgw,2008-11-26 02:31:00,585,ok so im outa luck for stipers. i have been mackerel fishing but when we went it was a ways out  how close do they come to shore? And does any one know how big gaspereau  get i have got little ones but nothing huge.
272019,douG,2008-11-26 02:56:00,2693,"I schooled my NS bro in law with a 3/8 oz silver blue cleo for mackerel last August at a pier near Halifax.  One on the hook, and three more trying to take the spoon too.  Every species spends some time near shore, you gotta do that research.  I think the gaspereau are just like the alewives in Lake O, some sorta herring."
272020,bigugli,2008-11-26 02:58:00,6138,I've gotten mackerel right off the govt. pier in Lunenberg. Sometimes you can jig squids off the docks in the evening.
272022,purekgw,2008-11-26 03:03:00,585,i do have the use of a kayak so aslong ans i meet them half way i should be ok and we ushally just using jigging spoons or u can set up like 3 on one rig thats run lol
272068,ecxstriper,2008-11-26 05:05:00,343,Ah those damn stripers. The bane of my existence   I fish almost exlcusivley for stripers down here in the States. Not that I'm any good at it . Fire me off a pm and I'll try and get you started .
272080,HTHM,2008-11-26 11:30:00,4082,"MAckeral can be caught off the dock, Buzz Bombs work well, as does a hook with raw cut up bait fish chunks. However if you can get the chance try to go out on a tuna charter. That would be a challenge! Enjoy your time there it is a great province."
272088,BITEME,2008-11-26 12:47:00,1969,The stripers are usually chasing the mackeral on the east coast tide coming in and at the turn best times
272165,Rich,2008-11-26 15:38:00,3927,Stripers were starting to come in the end of May last year. Pick a big river and toss big baits. I was told to use cut up smelt and mackerel on bottom. Make sure you have equipment large enough to handle stripers. Heavy musky gear will probably do.  I don't know this from first-hand experience but the tackle shop owner I talked to when I was in NS last year filled me in on the details.
272287,ranger520vx,2008-11-26 21:25:00,164,I have caught Stripers in St.Marys Bay between Digby & Yarmouth Nova Scotia by fishing several fish plant effulent discharges that had piers and breakwalls assosciated near them. Landed several between 25-30 pounds in August and I'm told they migrate around the Bay.
272439,bucktail,2008-11-27 02:25:00,1857,"A new canadian record 57 was caught there last May but the name of the river escapes me. The fishin canada show did a Nova Scotia striper show not long ago, maybe check out there website."
272452,purekgw,2008-11-27 02:57:00,585,o yah i remember watching that at work one day dont they use big eel things?
272487,bigugli,2008-11-27 05:39:00,6138,I thought FNC did their show in New Brunswick on either the St Johns or Miramichi rivers.
272552,Golfisher,2008-11-27 15:07:00,586,"Striped bass are closed all along the Northumberland Strait and the Gulf. This sucks big time because when I moved to Antigonish, NS a few months ago, I was really looking forward to getting my hands on those strippers.  Apparently cod isn't the only species to collapse.  The Bay of Fundy and rivers runnning into it are open though. A bit out of your way from PEI, but that's your best bet. I heard lots of good things about the Shubenacadie in NS, though I haven't had a chance to give it a try myself.  To tell you the truth, I found saltwater fishing here rather disappointing. But the mackerels are plentiful when they come in, and they taste pretty darn good."
272571,bigugli,2008-11-27 15:55:00,6138,"That's because most of the inshore fishery had collapsed a long time back. For every 30 or so mackerel you'll hook, you might haul up 1 pollock, haddock or cod."
