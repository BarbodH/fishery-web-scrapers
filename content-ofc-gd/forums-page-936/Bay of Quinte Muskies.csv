272293,DANIMAL,2008-11-26 21:39:00,215,"  There are huge musky in Lake O. Theres just not a lot of them. Probably because there is not a lot of good spawning habitat, and enough pike (witch spawn earlyer) to take the habitat that is there."
272296,F7Firecat,2008-11-26 22:10:00,347,"They are there, its like fishing a needle in a haystack.  Probably spend all their time chasing baitfish around the lake, the odd one being caught in BOQ, no doubt they are there.  "
272436,bucktail,2008-11-27 02:19:00,1857,"I think they are on the increase because I have fished ther for 35 years and have only seen a few up until 7-8 years ago and now I have seen 4-5. My brother got a 48 incher in the trent at the mouth, I raised a nice 45 incher at the mouth of the Moira a few years ago. Up river in the moira and trent there are good places with nice sized fish as well. I really am surprised no one has popped a 50lber trolling toward the bath power plant in the fall while fishing eyes, St Larry isnt very far away from that. For the brave at heart I have heard of large fish being hooked out near the Duck Islands...but thats a real needle in the haystack!"
271878,Guest steel'n'esox,2008-11-25 23:26:00,0,"Just wondering if anyone fishes for or has caught muskies in the Bay or Quinte, as most of the fishing pressure is on walleyes and bass"
271881,kemper,2008-11-25 23:29:00,2232,"I have also wondered this, as well as is there any decent musky fishing out on the big lake...  I once came across a recently dead MONSTER 'ski in the whitby harbour, so I would assume if they can be found there, there is probably a fishable population at Quinte?  Also im thinking if there was a fishable population they would probably be giants?"
271893,Guest steel'n'esox,2008-11-25 23:44:00,0,"Thanx for the reply kemper,many years ago probably close to 25 I caught a small ski 20 inches or so at the old A&P hole aka Bi-Way hole at the Ganny on a roe bag, Im sure there out there in Lake O but the needle in the haystack scenerio might apply there. With the Bay though everything there seems to come in large and xtra large so im hoping the muskies are the same"
271934,Pigeontroller,2008-11-26 00:50:00,2793,"There are Muskie in all parts of the Great Lakes...Whether or not they are there in enough quantity to make fishing for them worthwhile, thats another story."
271935,Rich,2008-11-26 00:53:00,3927,"Lower Niagara, Dalhousie have some targettable populations. I don't see why the north side of the lake wouldn't have them too. For the love of god somebody troll a Jake through Pickering and let me know for sure!"
271992,superdad,2008-11-26 02:24:00,353,"There were at least tow muskies caught this fall in the BOQ, both showcased on quintefishing.com"
271994,Mike the Pike,2008-11-26 02:31:00,3421, A nice 42 incher was caught at night recently.
272056,ehg,2008-11-26 04:23:00,2666,"Saw one caught at Pickering, on a shad rap, many years ago.  Sounds like they are in Quinte but are caught by accident. I've heard of huge ones in that bay."
272063,smbhunter,2008-11-26 04:41:00,186,I actually saw a good size one surface last august while fishing for gar. Must have been about a 40 incher. Also saw 4 or 5 big pike as well.
272100,ccmtcanada,2008-11-26 13:32:00,7971,"I was fishing a local marina last summer where I was looking for pike and what did I see?  A huge muskie sunning itself about 3 feet from shore.  Took one look at it, thought pike, until I saw the markings...."
272106,Ramble,2008-11-26 13:42:00,713,im from Belleville and only once i've heard of them being caught. I'd dont think they are in their with any descent numbers. Pike out compete them....and there is some big pike in their.....BIG.  -R-
272109,lew,2008-11-26 14:03:00,12767,"There's some very big muskies that live in the rivers that flow into Quinte, infact only a few miles away, so it would stand to reason that they'd be more plentiful in the Bay, yet there are surprisingly few reports of them.  I've been fishing Quinte since 1955 and have spent alot of time over the years fishing for pike there, yet I have never hooked a musky, never had a follow or even seen one, infact I've never even talked to anyone personally who's caught one there.  But then again, howcum in the 100 years since the locks were built, the pike from Quinte have never found their way up into the eastern Kawarthas ??  Stange stuff indeed"
272111,Ramble,2008-11-26 14:14:00,713,I thought Pike were starting to invade the Kawarthas?
272115,lew,2008-11-26 14:19:00,12767," There's always the odd report of pike being caught in the western Kawarthas and I spose they are gradually working their way eastward, but certainly not enuff to classify it as an invasion........yet.  There's also scattered reports every year of tigers in there too so there's definetely some inter breeding going on too."
272127,Ramble,2008-11-26 14:35:00,713,Yeah a friend of mine fishes balsam hard for musky in the summer. I think he caught about 6 tigers and 3 pike this year. He keeps all the pike the brings in.
272139,johnnyb,2008-11-26 15:04:00,3413,I'd sure love to catch the muskie that feeds on BOQ walleyes....but if Lew says they're not in there...that's good enough for me
272146,DANIMAL,2008-11-26 15:13:00,215,Maybe theres better habitat for them in the close by St. Lawrence so most of the muskies in the area are there instead of Quinte. Just my guesse.
272150,PAZE,2008-11-26 15:20:00,132," Who says there not in there, one off the greatest musky fishing is in the st. lawrence river, if there in the river and at the mouth, there in the bay BOQ"
272157,lew,2008-11-26 15:30:00,12767," Nobody said they weren't any muskies  in there, and johnnyb was just making a joke when he used my name, but I think the jist of this thread is  that there doesn't seem to be as many muskies in the bay as many folks would expect, considering the large populations of them at either end of Quinte.......both coming & going."
272160,kemper,2008-11-26 15:34:00,2232,Someone troll a big jake through there PLEASE.  at least if you dont catch a ski you will probably be able to report a mutant gigantisaurus rex walleye that feeds on 12 pounders and has 9 inch fangs.
272163,cram,2008-11-26 15:37:00,1733,i was just about to put my musky gear away and you guys got me all excited.  :-)
272206,Ramble,2008-11-26 17:45:00,713,I'm gonna argue that low musky numbers in teh BOQ is due to competition for resources more then a habitat issue.  As Lew said there is rivers that run into the bay that have some impressive musky.  -R-
272209,Squid,2008-11-26 17:59:00,1656,don't put your gear away until the 13th of December!!
272211,cram,2008-11-26 18:05:00,1733," My lake is likely icing up right now.  My fishing is done for the season.  In all truth, i have never been much of a fall fisherman anyway.  Have tried, but once it gets cool and they move off the weeds i am usually pretty lost.  Besides -- isn't the season closer december 15th?"
272277,cram,2008-11-26 20:54:00,1733,"Curious -- why wouldn't there be HUGE musky in a lake ontario like lake system.  Aside from the walleye, there's lots of cisco/herring (i think) and salmonoids to eat."
