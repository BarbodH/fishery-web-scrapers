269863,qaz,2008-11-20 20:42:00,26,"Hey at least she fishies too.  Also to top that off she says that jumping a red eye flight to Calgary and bumming around the bow and area for a week sound like a great trip.  As long as I carry the heavy backpack(tent and camping gear) we can just crash on the river bank at night.  We have even talked about drifting the bow starting in Banff, and camping along the way.  Anyone want to tag along..."

270599,Tybo,2008-11-22 17:08:00,1373,"2 things you have too do before you get married.  1, Buy a plot, If you are going to bury yourself, you might as well be burried where you want.  2. You buy the ball and chain, If you leave it up to the wife,She will get you a girly man one(pink and fuzzie)."
270621,Jen,2008-11-22 17:52:00,833,"How can I resist... I like that song, but do remember there are those of US (the female gender) out there that just don't fit the bill...
