270887,Leecher,2008-11-23 04:57:00,7832," COOL Simon.... if you are allowed live minnows, give it a try.... Bass or any species can't resist them.... remember simple setup or try a spoon ""william wobbler"" of some sort with a jiggin rod.... just never know"
270920,lew,2008-11-23 09:59:00,12767,"Thanks for that Jacque, looks like you had an excellent season on the Mighty O.  The Ottawa River is a favorite location of mine and we try to do a musky trip up there every year in the Wendover area, but unfortunately didn't make it up this year, but will be back fer sure in 09.  Best of luck on the ice this winter."

270514,Roy,2008-11-22 11:52:00,13728,Lotsa fish for you this past season Jacques! Thanks for taking the time to post that for us. I've fished the big O on many occasions and it really IS one heck of a river. Gotta try Lac Ste-Marie a time or two. Looks like a pretty nice piece of water.  Thanks again and let's see the monster you're going to get this afternoon.  Be well.
270515,Handlebarz,2008-11-22 12:04:00,3790,lotsa nice pics there getting me excited for ice up now

270520,Spiel,2008-11-22 12:19:00,9065,....Good Lord there's a lot of fine eating in dem pictures.
270521,Radnine,2008-11-22 12:22:00,1538,Congrats on what looked to be a fun and productive year. Thanks for the post. Jim
270530,b2kptbo,2008-11-22 12:52:00,1505,"Looks like you did OK, good stuff, thanks for the report..."
270533,TroutnMuskieHunter,2008-11-22 12:57:00,1362,Great report Jacques  ...some of those places look familiar  ....I was hoping to get out for some Muskie action this morning but was greeting with a surprise of ICE in front of the house!!  ....my season may be finished   ...
270539,Greencoachdog,2008-11-22 13:22:00,8163,Yup! A very productive season for you Jacques!!!  Do you eat the Catfish or let them go?  Congratulations on some great catches!!!
270545,Moosebunk,2008-11-22 13:49:00,3970,Fine year Jacques.  I especially like seeing those O-river cats and nice crappie too.  Good luck on the ice in 09.... it's almost time now.
270594,Leecher,2008-11-22 16:56:00,7832,"Thanks everyone for the kind words It sure  was a fun year and looking forward to hard water Good luck to all of you and play it safe on hard water   The big O has lots to offer and is the only zone that we can fish with live minnows as bait If you ever want to try Lac St-Marie, I'd be more then happy to show you some of my hot spots Now if I can only catch a musky.... it be a great way to end the softwater season   I let them go simply because I tried one once and find them too oily.... lots of fat on them.  I prefer the lake cats.... a lot smaller and very tasty"
270653,limeyangler,2008-11-22 18:43:00,5204,"Hey Leechman....great stuff, like someone else said...thanks for taking the time to post that.  Just wondering....you got any tips for catching those smallmouths throughthe ice.?    There is a small lake next to the highway here that nobody really fishes...and it is full of BIG smallmouth....wanted to try last year but got into the whitefish to much...any advice welcome.   TY   simon"
270655,misfish,2008-11-22 18:53:00,29133,WOW what a collection of pics of your successful year.   magnifique Jacques
270657,Leecher,2008-11-22 18:55:00,7832," Thanks Simon,  All those bass were caught on a tip-up rigged with hook and minnow...... On the Ottawa river, we are allowed live minnows but anywhere else, only allowed dead frozen minnows.  Some of my buddies use jiggin rods rigged with a spoon and were catching bass. Not sure when bass season closes in Ontario, if I were you, I'd check the Ont. MNR regs for your region.  Out here in Quebec, it closes March 31st, 2009.  Jacques"
270658,Leecher,2008-11-22 18:56:00,7832, Merci Brian

270730,fishindevil,2008-11-22 22:09:00,6254,"Well it sure looks like you had a stellar harwater/softwater year of fishing !!!.  ..some very nice eyes & cats,and man do those cats ever fight hard in the ottawa river,i think because of fighting the current all the time,they are just sooooo,strong !!!!   ive been fishing the river for almost 20yrs and its awesome cause you truely never know what you are going to catch as there is just about everything that swims in the mighty ottawa !!!!....thanks for sharing   cheers"
270745,mepps,2008-11-22 22:30:00,1301,"nicely done, thats gonna be hard to top in 09!"
270856,Leecher,2008-11-23 03:41:00,7832, Thanks fishindevil    What you said is so true.... never know what you can catch on the Ottawa and that's what makes it real exciting    Them cats sure put up a good tussle.... the bigger ones keep bottom and use the current to it's advantage Thanks again and will be keeping an eye out for your hard water report    Thanks mepps... sure is going to be hard but will give it me best.... just can't wait for some safe ice to build and then is rock on
270882,limeyangler,2008-11-23 04:28:00,5204,"   Thanks Jacques.   Its ok....bass season in area 5 is open all year...some size limits from November to July...but thats about it. I got some  folks upset , thinking i was breaking the regs,  responding to posts early in the season.....lol...i think they were even more upset when they realised i COULD fish for them...just kidding folks."
