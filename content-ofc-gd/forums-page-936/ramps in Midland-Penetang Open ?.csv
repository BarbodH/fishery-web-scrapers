271375,tinbanger,2008-11-24 17:04:00,1028,hoping someone ( Motv8r or Irishfield?) know if the Pentanguishene ramp is still accessible . Looked ok last week but cold weather must have put some pretty thick ice in there . Creek behind our place has a good sheet of ice on it !  back up is Niagara ( tomorrow) but wouldn't mind a shorter drive.  appreciate any info  TB

271389,tinbanger,2008-11-24 17:28:00,1028,Thanks Krawler  Where is Central Marine ? The ramp I saw last week ( bone dry ) was right behind 'dock Lunch' restaurant .  TB
271391,tinbanger,2008-11-24 17:31:00,1028,"Krawler  Sorry , just got my lazy A$% in gear and looked it up myself ,will call this afternoon and check thanks again  TB"
271478,motv8tr,2008-11-24 21:45:00,2587,"Sorry Dave, I don't know for sure, my turn is before the ramp....it's snowing pretty good up here right now though, so if you come, bring salt/sand or something for traction....let me know if you head up this way, my days off are Tue/Wed for the next 3 weeks.  Maureen"
271561,irishfield,2008-11-25 00:56:00,26272,We're in a wet blizzard here right now Dave.. a couple inches in the last hour or two. Last I'd heard Penetang Harbour was iced over around the town dock.. but haven't seen it myself.  Central Marine is right beside Scullies Crab Shack at the Midland Town dock.
271671,tinbanger,2008-11-25 13:21:00,1028,thanks for the replies  me thinks Gbay might be done for the year.  we got a couple of inches of wet heavy snow last night as well . didn't really want to pull the boat around on the messy roads anyways. hoping maybe friday things will dry up a bit.  TB
271714,F7Firecat,2008-11-25 15:27:00,347,we got a 43 incher on the bay sunday  season is not over yet!
271725,tinbanger,2008-11-25 16:03:00,1028,its just  gettin the boat out from the launch that may be my problem.  Glad to hear you had some luck on the weekend  TB
271817,irishfield,2008-11-25 20:33:00,26272,"Dave... Penetang Harbour is ""stiff"" ... Pete Peterson Midland channel is still blocked off by silt boom !"
