271554,GBW,2008-11-25 00:44:00,8460,Hi all.  Question for you.  My father had his Garmin iQue M5 hooked up to his notebook to do an update when it (GPS) lost power part way through.  Now the unit is giving him an error and will not boot fully.  Is the unit pooched or is there something that I can do for him?  Thanks.  Geoff

The instruction manual will state that if this happens you will have to send it to the manufacturer (did not read the IQ M5 manual)  Call Garmin, send it to Garmin.  Your firmware (or OS?) chip needs to be reflashed.  Usually, this is done by the internal software (that your dad was in the middle of updating). If Garmin is charging for the repair you can also try Durham Radio to see what they can do.  forrest"
