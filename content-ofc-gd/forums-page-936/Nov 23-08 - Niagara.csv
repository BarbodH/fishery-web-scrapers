271518,jwl,2008-11-24 23:33:00,1056,"thanks Dude, I am glad that was a big turnout..17 boats...42 people, lots of fun and prizes,..was a great day all around, I showed 2 total newbs what that kind of fishin is all about, they had some action, we couldn't have asked for a nicer wintery day for sure.  Dobee was in that derby too but not sure how he made out.....so how did ya make out Dobee???  We will probably get a couple boats out there and fill em up just for something to do soon again,will keep ya posted, we may even throw a derby like the last one together for next month  Once again Dobee, nice fish man...see ya on and around the river soon for sure"
271520,dobee,2008-11-24 23:40:00,301,"I will second canadadude's comments, i had a blast and got skunked!! lol it was fun though, met a few nice people... i will def be in the next one!!"

271523,canadadude,2008-11-24 23:47:00,769,"I'm in for another derby next month guys, gotta get my boater dudes to go along but I'm sure they'll be game the fish'in just will get better on the niagara! Great fun with a great a bunch of anglers and a chance to get some $$$$$ what else can you ask for"
271607,charlied,2008-11-25 02:52:00,584,hopefully next derby a boat doesn't come off the trailer when launching again.   LOL
271609,jwl,2008-11-25 03:05:00,1056," well thankfully nothing happened to that boat much more than a few scratches on the bottom and scrape on the skeg of the motor.....I am sure everyone really felt bad for the guy at the time for sure and everyone chipped in to resolve the trouble as quick as they could..I didn't see it happen just heard when we pulled into the road to wait to launch..I was 2nd last boat in the water as I was one of the guys running the derby so...only seemed right, I didn't have to race anyways, I took home the money for biggest brown  As for any incidents...a boat slippin off sucks really bad for sure, but all was okay in the end,I never take my strap and safety chain off until the boat is pretty much in the water...1 boat plug in wrong spot so they had to pull out really quick...  , besides a couple usual cold start problems for cold wetaher fishing, all went in and out pretty good  now we should all get back to Dobee's regularly scheduled post here"
271661,dobee,2008-11-25 12:11:00,301,"thread jacker! lol  i was there when the boat fell off, then wouldnt start... ouch!! and i was there when bowen's boat started to get a little heavy and wet  now back to jack's derby thread!"
271666,solopaddler,2008-11-25 13:03:00,8605,"Way to go Joe, that river can be a tough nut to crack at times."
