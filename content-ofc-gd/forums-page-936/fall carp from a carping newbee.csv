265700,spinnerdoc,2008-11-09 01:23:00,556,"i am new to this type of fishing.started mid summer for a few days but been doing it for the last six weeks and these are  what i came up with....i am hooked didn't want to buy all the gear but looks like i am going to. met a couple of people who are nice enough to lend me some tips and did some experementing myself . in the end after putting in my time it all paid off.learned my own mix for the chum and making hair rigs and all...and best thing is my new fishing buddy copied my set up and he has been having good luck with it, that's like the best compliment from the old timer.considering hes been at it for a long time, and i did learn a lot from the fellow...tight lines everybody and the fishing ain't over yet will add more as the weeks go by.....        "
265701,purekgw,2008-11-09 01:25:00,585,carp are still out there this time of year?!?!?!?!
265703,spinnerdoc,2008-11-09 01:29:00,556,ohh yes its not like spring but they are there. the oldtimer i met and fish with says he's been catching them till late november. our goal is to get one in decemder....he he we'll see.
265715,Victor,2008-11-09 03:16:00,1609,Great job spinnerdoc! It's hard to see because the pics are so small but it seems that quite a few of them have some big bellies! And i really like the golden color of the one in the 2nd pic.  They still eat in the colder weather ... just not as active when it's hot out. Thanks for sharing.
265769,Beans,2008-11-09 14:35:00,3339,I got back into fishing for carp about four years ago...congrats on your catches...  One thing I would like to suggest before some of the other carp fishermen on here get upset...try not to land your fish on cement or rocks as thrashing around like they do can harm them internnaly...try to lie them on some grass if handy or better yet buy a carp fishing mat...  Crappieperchhunter and I like to release them with hemostats at the shoreline without taking them completely out of the water...  
265828,ccmtcanada,2008-11-09 17:35:00,7971,"Way to go!!!  You took the time, learned what you could, tested them out, and had success....that's what it's all about!  Congrats on a nice haul there...some real brutes by the looks of it.  It's always more rewarding when you put the work in like that."
265842,bassjnkie,2008-11-09 18:20:00,1101,"Nice carp, congrats! Now your hooked, time for the Euro tackle!! Great job!!  Daniel"
266057,spinnerdoc,2008-11-10 02:10:00,556,"thanks guys and beans you are right about the carp on cement that fish was caught when i didn't have my rubberized net yet and thanks for telling me, what are hemostats by the way? that won't happen again.i love the rubberized net that i got. it's a frabill. the biggest fish was a 26 lbs and took the longest bec the dorsal fin got tangled in the net.i didn't realize the bone it it was jagged like a saw, wont want to be hit by that.it got tangled on my fishing buddy's net.  i figure i still have a couple of weeks before the water freezes over hehe. i'll try for more and post them, any one interested in posting can show off their pics here.....my fishing buddy's nephew caught a mirror carp i think it was over 20lbs. beautiful looking fish.  victor , i love the color on these fish, but i like the last four pics, they are very silverish and some green hue to them, and they are also the smaller fishes"
266066,Victor,2008-11-10 02:34:00,1609, it's good to hear that we have another carp lover here   ... most people hate carp around here  I find that the smaller (up to maybe 5-6lbs or so) carp you'll usually get a silvery color and rarely see any gold/yellow in them. On the other hand I've never see a bigger fish that has the silverish look. (i'm only talking about common/mirror carp in ontario)  Here's my personal fav. pic   and here's a baby carp 
266083,Leecher,2008-11-10 03:27:00,7832,Great report and pics spinnerdoc  I don't target / fish for carp but appreciate your efforts and congratulate you on a job well done  Thanks for sharing Leechman
266096,MJL,2008-11-10 04:25:00,2427,"Great reportage + pics there Spinnerdoc.  Carp can be caught throughout the year and even through ice (if you're lucky ) .  I'm sure there will be more fish to come before the end of the year.  As for colour, smaller carp (Usually 3lbs and under) and ones that come out of muddy/murky water tend to be more silvery or pale in colour.  I find in some places (Especially gin clear rivers) they even change colour and become darker in autumn and winter.  You may also catch fish with fiery red/orange tails VS the normal dark brown colour - perhaps it has something to do with their diet or the environment they live in.  As you fish more and more different waters across Ontario, you'll start to notice the differences from fish to fish.  Don't worry about not owning high-end Euro-tackle.  IMO, first learning about carp behaviour is key before taking the plunge into buying new carp tackle."
266162,Beans,2008-11-10 14:38:00,3339,"Hemostats/forceps are a much easier tool to use to extract a hook from a fish especially when fishing from shore as when carp fishing...unlike long nosed pliers you can clamp the hemostats/forceps to your clothing in any handy spot and they are always with you when needed...Rapala makes a good one as pictured below, but most surgical instrument suppliers have them at a cheaper price...  "
266173,crappieperchhunter,2008-11-10 15:17:00,2582,Nicely done spinnerdoc !!! Carp are pretty much all I chase from the end of May until the end of September. I just plain enjoy it. Then it's fall  perch and crappie mixed in with some steel and eyes until we get ice. Glad to see someone is keeping the carp honest while most of the rest of us are occupied with something else. Only those with the same addiction can appreciate your enthusiasm. Keep up the good work and thx for sharin.
266184,wolfville,2008-11-10 16:10:00,396,"Way to go, carp fishing is addictive. In UK some call Salmon the poor man's carp ;-)  Mind share where about you do your fishing (not the exact spot)? Read BBR's post, he catches them year round, winter carping is about the location and if you find them, you can get them any time of the year.  Keep the carp porn coming...."
271288,spinnerdoc,2008-11-24 04:22:00,556,"thanks for the all the congrats...i think i put it much more time chasing salmon than with the carp, and as yu can see i got way more, i suck at salmon fishing i got 0 this year and last year as well. i managed two hook ups but thats as far it got. i tried 2 more times after i posted and got no more carp....i think thats it for carp this year. looing forward for next spring. where i fish i thik is a bit shallow this time of year. i fish the credit mainly."
271434,muskeybugged,2008-11-24 19:13:00,282,"and here's a baby carp    If I was a musky........ mmm mmm mm!  Great report   , I'm an out of the closet carp lover too, being a urban dweller.  Quite a rush when they pick it up and run, a screaming reel is a screaming reel."
271450,hammercarp,2008-11-24 20:15:00,964,WTG! Spinnerdoc. Congradulations on the fish you caught and welcome to the fraternity of carp nuts. If you are looking for a good entry level carp rod Bass Pro has the Shimano Alivio's on sale for $59.99.( reg. around $100) I would get one in 2&1/2 or 2&3/4 pound test curve.
271533,trapshooter,2008-11-25 00:06:00,1234,"good fishn' there bud.  Some real fat carp, keep it going."
271543,kemper,2008-11-25 00:28:00,2232,"yuck, carp.  is it any coincidence that when you switch two letters of the word carp you get...oh nevermind.  Im just teasing, its the elitist steelhead pinner in me  good fishin"
271567,hammercarp,2008-11-25 01:09:00,964,"I know some centrepin guys that love fishing carp. They say there is nothing like it. Now that we are learning to catch carp all year long it just expands their opportunities to catch big powerful fish. The biggest carp that I have seen caught was by a center pin  fisherman. I was 42 lbs. I guess if you get enough practice on rainbow you can move up to the ""red octobers"" of our waters."
271582,kemper,2008-11-25 01:35:00,2232,"funny thing about carp fishing is that I NEVER target them, and yet often find them on my line!  I will admit, its a great fight....but DANG those things are ugly and slimey."
271636,spinnerdoc,2008-11-25 04:26:00,556,"they are fatties, even the 5-6 lb'ers  look fat...it's as if somebody blew air into them like a baloon. i used to be like.... carp, not worth my time..that all changed when i started catching them and i became convert. i mainly go for pike and bass and this is quite a change for me. i like it."
271788,wolfville,2008-11-25 19:23:00,396,"The carp might be ugly in some eyes (not mine), but think about what the fish thinks when it sees you"
271793,bassjnkie,2008-11-25 19:29:00,1101,"I see it this way, bows are fun in the rivers, but a 20+lb carp in 30' of water, digging strait down, now that's a thrill. Eating your lunch and the drag start screaming, that fun.  To all his/her own.  Daniel"
271860,spinnerdoc,2008-11-25 22:43:00,556,"i agree with daniel,  and on spring time...i hear they are stronger. i like their color....my goal to is to hit over 30lbs and catch me one of those mirror carp.  when i caught the big one above ...me and two old timers were talking how this spring  was amazing for them one guys said he caught a 32 pounder and they other guy a 29 lbs...i'm like wow, i'm just starting out...i'd be more than happy to get one over 2lbs and 5 mins later.....my strike indicator goes crazy. this one took longer than the ones i caught before and i am like right on, the fish ended up tangling with my buddy's line and we both landed it, that was fun....i am definitely hooked"
