I have seen the eve/gutter deicer cables on houses and think it may help , although the nearest downspout is 30-40 ft away ( around the corner) I presume in order for this device to work I would need to run cables in a zig zag pattern above the door area as well as along the gutter to teh nearest corner where I plan to add a down spout (about 15 feet away).  Any one have experince ,suggestions  appreciated as always  dave"
271463,misfish,2008-11-24 20:54:00,29133,"Dave Just run the deicer cable in the eves and down the spout.  Thats all I did at work,works fine. Adding a down spout is a piece of cake.   And make sure they are cleaned out of rubish and leaves."
271466,bigugli,2008-11-24 21:01:00,6138,"Your ice build up could be from an insufficient grade on your trough, or a slight sag along the one section. It is amazing how much trouble can be caused by a handful of leaves at the top of the gutter."
271479,Fisherman,2008-11-24 21:48:00,7201,"The formation of icicles at the edge can often be a result of insuffcient insulation at the edge of the wall plate where the trusses meet and, lack of air circulation by way of soffit vents. Snow will melt in the overhang area, run down a bit and refreeze as it goes over the edge. Might be worth having a pro give you advice, it can cause further damage by making ice dams which leak into the roof area."
271547,Wild,2008-11-25 00:31:00,704,Inspect the attic area for problems as well for water or ice damage.
271580,Sinker,2008-11-25 01:29:00,8692,"Yup, sounds to me like you have insulation/ventilation issues in your attic. A properly vented/insulated attic shouldn't melt snow.  Sinker"
271670,tinbanger,2008-11-25 13:17:00,1028,"thanks for the reponses.  definatly need to add a downspout ( should have done it this fall  ) the area in question is at the base of a valley facing south east and get lots of sun whuch is adding to the melt .steep pitch on one roof as well  roof is leaking ( or was , added new material to valley and patched some obvious spots this fall) new roof planned for the spring.  Gutters are clean  .  hoping for a bit more of a melt to get the deicer in .  thanks again  TB"
271674,Dartee,2008-11-25 13:30:00,47,"TinBanger  The heater cable in the Trough and down into the down spout should do the trick.  I have a similar issue where during the day snow melts at the top of the valley (when in the sun) (south east exposure) but when it gets to the ice-cold aluminum trough it freezes and slowly builds up eventually becoming a solid block of ice. (no ice on the roof)  The wire solves this.  I only have it plugged in when the temp will be between -2C and -10C, when its colder then that no issue."
