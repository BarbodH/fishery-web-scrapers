271560,silvio,2008-11-25 00:54:00,433,He wasn't going through. I think it was tons of slush on top of the ice with a little frozen slush covering it all. He would have gone through if there wasnâ€™t ice under him.

271605,charlied,2008-11-25 02:49:00,584,"still a stupid move....are people that lazy that they would risk a $15 -20,000 vehicle.  I would rather walk 3 miles than put my truck out on any ice.  Still looks like just slush like someone else said but it would still get the heart pumping for sure"
271629,Dutch,2008-11-25 03:47:00,831,"There's no ""almost"" when breaking through ice.  It either breaks and something goes through, or it doesn't.  Very stupid decision IMO."
271850,Bernie,2008-11-25 21:56:00,3190,Or like this? This one cost the guy 40 Grand to get it out. Also wrote off the truck. You can just see the roof sticking out.

272071,Dozer,2008-11-26 05:41:00,896,"Weird, why wouldn't the snowmobilers help the dude out?"
272089,Fisherman,2008-11-26 12:50:00,7201,"Wierd, why wierd, then the twit would ""come to expect"" everyone to help him out of his stupidity every time he did something STOOPID.  You drive on the ice, you takes your chances, expecially under those ice conditions."
272101,cityfisher,2008-11-26 13:33:00,959,crap happens trust me I know... Lots of ignornant people out there
