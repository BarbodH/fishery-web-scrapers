271715,blaque,2008-11-25 15:27:00,2419,"Was stuck on tying marabou for the longest time and made the switch to rabbit hair, it may not be easier, but its a heck of a lot less messy.........and the action of the rabbit strips in the water is better in my opinion.       Tied a few more marabous just to do a direct comparison on tying time and mess lol   Tied these all up on a saturday and caught a bunch of these on them on sunday     My 9 year old nephews creation LOL   Hes got a good jelly wrap going on this one and LOVES making new and funky creations.   And he is indeed HARDCORE LOL......he will get fully dressed in waders even if its just to practice casting in the front yard   I caught this candid shot with a full look of concentration. Its just hilarious and heartwarming at the same time. "

271721,tipupesox,2008-11-25 15:49:00,167,"Nice looking jigs Blaque ..........  The picture of your nephew is priceless, you have to love the ambition ........ Hit the upper stretch of Cayuga for a few hours Saturday morning, went 3 for 4 on a white jig tipped with a pink Berkley power wiggler (grub)."
271724,fishnpro,2008-11-25 15:57:00,93,That last pic so reminds me of myself when I was a young lad.
271728,blaque,2008-11-25 16:07:00,2419, We did REAL well the weekend before this past one in the same areas. The water was on the rise and the fish were active as expected!
271734,danbo,2008-11-25 16:42:00,2646,Nice..check out some Spey Hackle as well..super long-flowing strands!
271795,blaque,2008-11-25 19:41:00,2419,"yeah ive seen some pretty wicked looking spey flies, a scrumptous looking fly for sure"
271811,kemper,2008-11-25 20:28:00,2232,"rabbit strip all the way!  I used to tie marabou as well, but its just too messy! (especially in a tiny dorm room)  Those are some fine looking jigs"
271814,Joey,2008-11-25 20:29:00,9122,Where did you buy the rabbit fur? Or should I say the hare hair?  Nice looking lures btw!  Joey
271826,blaque,2008-11-25 20:58:00,2419,"Any fly shop will have them, gander mountains and Bass Pros im sure as well. Bunny Strips, the fur comes on strips about 1/4"" wide. Any fly tying supplier online also will have them.  Kemper, you ever sneeze while tying up marabou jigs, and forget about what it is youve just been doing for an hour..........POOF!!!!!!"
271942,Leecher,2008-11-26 01:03:00,7832,Real nice looking jigs Blaque     I'm not a fly fisherman but appreciate your fine work  Quick question.... how long does it take to tie one of those?  I can see the passion your nephew has for that type of fishing..... he's got it down to a T Leechman
272097,blaque,2008-11-26 13:29:00,2419,"i timed a tie on the rabbits for ya lol, and it was exactly two minutes at a liesurely pace. THats just me, could be quicker, could be slower obviously. But at a pretty relaxed pace, thats what i come up with"
272123,kemper,2008-11-26 14:28:00,2232,How are you tying those ones? I think I probably tie mine right around two minutes too but are those done the same way?  Tie in the strip at the back/ wrap it to the front and tie it in again?
272135,blaque,2008-11-26 14:54:00,2419,"Just like that Kemp.  Wrap the needle and bead on the hook, bring your thread to the back, tie in the strip, bring your thread to the eye of the hook, ""palmer"" the strip up to the eye, tie off, clip excess and done."
272137,blaque,2008-11-26 15:04:00,2419," Oh and just an FYI leech, i floatfish these jigs, im not much of a flyrodder either....and these are weighted jigs, not exactly in the ""fly"" family...so ya dont have to be a fly guy to float one of these in the stream leech, you got a spinning rod and reel? a couple floats? Go to it my man, youll be hooked up in no time! I only flyfish for stream trout in the summer months (dries) and thats not that often. I tie up all kinds of other ""flies"" or patterns i should call them,  but always fish them under a float."
272141,danbo,2008-11-26 15:05:00,2646,"Try ""Matuka""-style with a chenille/tinsel belly too."
272143,kemper,2008-11-26 15:10:00,2232,  I tied some of those up this spring..found it took much longer to tie them and they didnt perform as well.  that said I know guys that swear by them
272144,blaque,2008-11-26 15:11:00,2419," See, thats what i was after when i picked up the bunny strips, i was looking at tying something more along those lines, ive always wanted to take a shot at them, but then my ambition kind of deflated, or i should say, got side tracked when thinking i could simplify my jigs, so i did that first. Ive got a pattern for the Matuka style just waiting to get back to the table lol"
272159,danbo,2008-11-26 15:33:00,2646,http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAgg9ttuYZo  I add Bead-chain Eyes too.
272178,Leecher,2008-11-26 16:08:00,7832, Ahhhh now I understand..... thanks Blaque for the info
272218,super dave,2008-11-26 18:27:00,323,Ever tried tinsel jigs?  Or mylar tubing?
