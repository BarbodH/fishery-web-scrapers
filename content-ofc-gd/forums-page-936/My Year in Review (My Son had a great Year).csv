271008,Mike the Pike,2008-11-23 16:16:00,3421,"Well with some of you posting your year in review I thought I would give it a whirl.  This was a tough year for me If I fished out of others boats I seemed to find the fish but if I was in my boat I had a tough time my son however found a way to slime the boat time after time.  2 species I have never caught will have to wait until next year.  I am yet to catch my first Lake trout (My son knows how to do that).  Muskie was not to be this year but I did get my first follow.  New species I caught a shad pretty big one too.  Overall it was a good year except for the numerous times getting chased off the water by multiple thunderstorms.  Although my year was slow my last trip to Quinte made up for the lack of fish Looking forward to next season and the Hard water.  Here are some pics from this year.         If the fish are not biting build a snowman.   My boy's first Pike     Finally skated on the Rideau Canal in Ottawa.   # generations ice fishing my Dad Myself and my son.   Spring came and I bid my farewell to this boat which served me well for 4 yrs An 18ft Lund SSV with Honda 50hp barebones Aluminium.   I traded her in and bought a new Lund 1660 Classic but I did keep my Honda from the SSV.   Spring arrived and I finally got my new boat I started sleeping better lol.        The Kiwanis fishing Tournament Bay of Quinte first weekend of May.       A shot of good friend GlennK in a tournament we placed 4th with a Grand Slam Pike ,walleye &Perch.   Dink walleye May 24 weekend in Quinte.   Now you all won't ever forget this pic I may actually attempt to hold one with my hand next year.     My Dad in Quinte one long skinny pike.   A shad    July came and Percher(34.72)invited us to Quinte with Fishindevil.  Junior had a great weekend and he told his mom we ate fish because of him.      Fishindevil and Percher in the old boat.     I caught some bait.    Little boy caught 8 walleyes to my one bait fish.   Off to Percher's in July I had my chance for a salmon and well it got away.My son with his first ever salmon 6lbs.                                    Looking forward to next year.Mike The Pike"

271203,Leecher,2008-11-24 01:01:00,7832,Great report and pics Mike  Thanks for taking the time to put together this report Loved the ice pics.... the second one where you see the huts lined up..... was that from an Outfitter? The area looks real beautiful  The new ride sure looks real nice Congratulation to both of you for a great year of fishing  Looking forward to the hard water reports
271210,trapshooter,2008-11-24 01:25:00,1234,Looks like a great season with lots of fish.  Nice new boat and good to see you and your son got to do a lot of fishing together.  Congrats on a fine year.
271215,PERCHER,2008-11-24 01:33:00,787,Good report there Mike.And next year will bring more and better times with my little buddy Ryan outfishing you.You know it's allright for a father to ask his son for some tips every now and then.  We will see you two next year for sure.Maybe we can do a Quinte or Simcoe ice fish this year.But if we do I am going to have to hide a banana in Ryans pocket. Dan
271246,ehg,2008-11-24 02:35:00,2666,"Looks like your son had a great year! Each year will get better and better for him, wait until you get into the muskies at Lake of Two Mountains. Lots of great fishing around Montreal.  At least Quinte salvaged your year at the end.  Nice post, ehg"
271254,snag,2008-11-24 02:46:00,1932,Sweet!  Great review. A good review has mostly family in it!  Thanks
271306,wgk36,2008-11-24 12:10:00,69,Great report Mike.  You guys (especially Ryan) had a great year in the new boat.  Looking forward to many outsting with you next year.  Ice fishing is only a couple of months away
271312,chickenhawk,2008-11-24 12:40:00,612,The boy has the touch! nice report!   Hawk
271313,lew,2008-11-24 12:47:00,12767,"Looks like a good season to me Mike !!  Lotsa fish'n with your dad & sons, 4th place in a tourney, some big Quinte eyes to close the year, and a new boat......... it's just too bad you had to settle for a LUND though, but perhaps next year you can upgrade  Nothing wrong with that year Mike, congrats !!"
271316,Greencoachdog,2008-11-24 13:02:00,8163,"Real nice year in review for you and the young'un Mike!!!  ... but I gotta tell ya, if I lived that close to the Larry I believe I could have a Musky pic or 2 in there... at least 1 little one eh?"
271317,Marko,2008-11-24 13:07:00,854,Looks like a lot of quality time spent with your kids and lots of good fishing as well. Great going Mike!
271885,ccmtcanada,2008-11-25 23:35:00,7971,"Mike...may have been a slow year for you, but to have your son with you on all those trips had to have been a bonus!!!!  He's turning into quite the angler!  That pic of you with the tiny little cat is my favourite pic of the year...LOL.  Getting the new boat was a big bonus...don't worry, I predict some muskie and lake trout slime next year for you.  Until then, I look forward to your ice reports...heck, I may even try that out this winter....  Great recap Mike!  Hope to have the opportunity to fish with you in 2009."
