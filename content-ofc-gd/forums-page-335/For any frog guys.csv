761675,Cudz,2013-01-23 00:45:00,2652,Je ne parle pas de mes amis francophone.  Canadian Tire in Barrie has Matzuo two pack of weedless frogs for $3.19.  One is pretty small but the other is good size. Now I am not usually a fan of Matzuo products but a soft cheap weedless frog is not a bad investment. I would probably throw these in PIkey water as I have in past lost $10 frogs to the toothy critters.  Hooks look ok and we will see how they do.  I couldn't pass up the deal.  These are popper style frogs and I don't have many of them so I will give them a try. At about $1.60 per frog it is not a bad deal. Here is a pic of the two packs I bought

761754,Freshtrax,2013-01-23 04:50:00,2215,"""It's moving and that makes me angry, I'm gonna eat it""..... The mind of a bass most days. Nice frogs for the price."
761803,msp,2013-01-23 13:37:00,1336,"Now, Now Bill. be nice to the bass"
761820,manitoubass2,2013-01-23 14:41:00,11391,"Two of my boys like using those frogs, and they do really well with them towards the end of July. I'm not sure why but they have an easier time hooking up on the small versions???  Great price, I woulda grabbed a few as well"
761848,misfish,2013-01-23 16:56:00,29133,Need to pick some up. Throwing them with the fly rod should be fun.
761853,Roy,2013-01-23 17:13:00,13728, Wouldn't you be breaking off a lot of tippets using those on a fly rod? Defeats the purpose of having a flyline?
761858,moxie,2013-01-23 17:58:00,1566,"Dream Killer!!!!  hehehe. Never you  mind Brian, have at er."
761864,BillM,2013-01-23 18:24:00,17367, LOL!!!   I wanna see a vid of this.
761866,jedimaster,2013-01-23 18:32:00,3472,Better wear a motorcycle helmet.
761867,Rattletrap2,2013-01-23 18:35:00,1652,Here I sit....surrounded by ice and snow. Temperatures have been -15 degees for two days......and now you are talking FROGS.....and BASS.......and JULY........What are you trying to do to me? LOL
761870,BillM,2013-01-23 18:48:00,17367,"Brian, you'd have an easier time firing a frog out with this!!    Or maybe even a miniature Trebuchet!  "
761891,misfish,2013-01-23 20:26:00,29133,"Hey,I think the small one will work.  I will atleast try.Cant be any worse they throwing a marshmello."
761914,jedimaster,2013-01-23 21:37:00,3472,Isn't fly fishing all about subtle finessing. Not powering through the slop? How are you gonna pull the fish out of the weeds? I am sur eyou will get hits but setting the hook and getting the fish out will be a challenge. I have lost fish frog fish in pads with 50 pound braid and 8 foot heavy action rods with high ratio baitcaster. picking up the slack and getting it nose up is gonna be tough. I say get some go pro action of this.
761937,misfish,2013-01-23 22:46:00,29133," No,where I fish,it will be a good hook set and land. Video? LOL"
762059,Cudz,2013-01-24 04:42:00,2652,The little one is light.  Go for it Brian.  Might b hard to hook set but who knows.
762082,Rich,2013-01-24 11:15:00,3927,"I wouldnt pay a dollar for them. Bass opener I bought three. Every single one busted and was junk after one 12"" bass."
762090,DoubleDigits,2013-01-24 12:35:00,140,Alabama rig
762092,Rich,2013-01-24 12:36:00,3927,"Three 12"" bass. You see on Long Point Bay, every bass is 12"" long.  ^^^  This is me poking fun at myself, not a serious statement. Lol"
762370,fishdawg,2013-01-25 03:36:00,912,I prefer the Live Target frogs...
762372,dhickey,2013-01-25 04:12:00,1038,A hook with a cork on it would catch bass in shallow weedy places. Give me a big crazy crawler or houla popper or a waterdawg and look out.. Not to say frog lures dont work but I have yet to find one that out produces live frogs or the lures above.
762377,Cudz,2013-01-25 04:29:00,2652,Exactly. The only thing that works almost as well on/over the pads is maybe a texas rige senko or plastic frog (non hollow)
762378,Cudz,2013-01-25 04:31:00,2652,So do I but that is a $10+ frog.  I get 2 for fir just over $3.  I have some Live target frogs but there is always a chance of losing said lure in waters full of toothy critters. I don't mind losing $1.60 I don't like losing $10
762418,Christopheraaron,2013-01-25 13:51:00,3525,If anyone wants to see me cast one of those frogs on a fly rod buy me a couple packs and ill shoot a vid of it
