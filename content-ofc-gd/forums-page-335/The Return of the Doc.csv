761758,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2013-01-23 05:46:00,0,"Hey all.  It's been a while.  Fishing has taken the back seat for me in the last few months but I thought I'd share my trout closer trip from the fall.  It was one of the longer portage trips I've ever taken although I was able to use a dolly.  Hell, I even managed to carry in a Heinekeg.  All things said and done, we had a very successful trip.  Nothing huge, but a very chunky strain of specks was more than willing to bite much of the weekend.  When it wasn't freezing cold we snapped some pics. Enjoy!                   "
