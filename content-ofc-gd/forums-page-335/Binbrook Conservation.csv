762230,bigugli,2013-01-24 21:27:00,6138,Best to go to their website.  http://www.npca.ca/conservation-areas/binbrook/
762248,solopaddler,2013-01-24 22:46:00,8605,"I was walking all over it today with the dog. Not sure how much ice exactly, but it's frozen hard as a rock with almost no snow cover."
762266,Broker,2013-01-24 23:22:00,482,Suppose they'll open up for the weekend?
762273,registerfly,2013-01-24 23:43:00,198,still listed as unsafe...
762299,Christopheraaron,2013-01-25 00:29:00,3525,"Maybe it hasn't been updated, might be worth a call to see if its changed"
762302,Broker,2013-01-25 00:38:00,482,"Ill wait till tommorow night to give them a call, hopefully shes ready for the weekend!"
762311,hotsky,2013-01-25 00:55:00,400,I hope so because it's going to warm up again on Monday and Tuesday :/
762407,Rich,2013-01-25 12:54:00,3927,All the other small lakes are safe in the area. Long Point Bay is safe. Dunnville is safe. I'm willing to bet there's six inches of ice.
762682,pics,2013-01-26 03:25:00,1268,Binbrook is still not safe due to high winds that kept it open even when the deep freeze.It is now frozen over but some spots are less than the 6 inches of black ice needed to open. With a staffed park there are issues with health and safety regulations so they have to have a strict policy in place...
