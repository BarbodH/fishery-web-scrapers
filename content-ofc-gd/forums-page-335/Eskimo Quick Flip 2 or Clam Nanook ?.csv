762161,troutologist,2013-01-24 17:23:00,951,I have the Nanook Thernal and have nothing but glowing recommendations for it. The new quick clips make setup/take down very easy. Its been on the ice almost 30days this winter and no signs of wear.  If I can tow it 10km across Lake Winnipeg in -30c it is decently tough.

762203,moxie,2013-01-24 19:31:00,1566,Congrats on the buy. Older Fish Traps and Eskis are made much better as opposed to the inferior shacks they make now. Frabill has maintained product integrity so far and although on the heavier side there is good reason for that. Just my opinion.I bought a used Shapell Rover 1.5DLX last season. Average in quality but at the $120 price point how could I pass it up? Next shack will be a Frabill.
