761166,ah_long,2013-01-21 08:08:00,354,"for low HP motors, why not go for the pirhana props instead?"
761171,bigbuck,2013-01-21 12:13:00,2449,"A stainless prop could help you. Usually you go up a pitch when going to stainless. That helps top speed. You will probably need to try out a couple of different props to see which works best for you. A good prop shop should be able to help. Stainless is great for lakes with sandy bottoms. I boated and fished Georgian Bay, Ive seen what happens to an aluminum prop when it hits a shoal, it gets shredded and the skeg gets mangled, thats usually it. A stainless prop doesnt break and transfers the impact right on up, wrecking the prop shaft causing thousands in damage. Terry, the hubs may help but ultimately the blades dont shear off easily and damage will occur. Lew, you got Real lucky. Ranger, i would try out a prop that is lower in pitch to get some bow lift, you will probably lose a bit of speed but it may work. it sounds like you have more than just prop issues. Has Lund been any help? What about Yamaha?"
761173,lew,2013-01-21 12:37:00,12766," I'm well aware of that Bruce, I've been driving boats for a very long time."
761174,aplumma,2013-01-21 12:40:00,6896,"Mike because the SS does not flex under take off load it gets a better holeshot , I went up 2 pitches from my aluminum prop and found no loss in my bottom end. this is on a 150 hp motor with a ranger ( heavy) boat.   Art"
761176,ecmilley,2013-01-21 13:05:00,2163,"http://www.mercurymarine.com/propellers/prop-selector/# i prefer stainless steel, better performance on my 150 motor, it all comes down to you can get a stainless prop tailered to your excact needs. i currently use a 4 bladed piranna prop that helps with hole shot and cornering duty it's a 24 pitch with some cupping on the blades and it allows me to run 60 mph @ 5100rpm i ould pick up some top end just swirching to a 3 bladed fury and maybe dropping to a 23 pitch as i can run the engine at 5800 with out issues"
761869,Sinker,2013-01-23 18:41:00,8692,"The way I grind up props, I couldn't afford to be replacing/repairing stainless, and I'm sure my prop shaft would be warped among other things.  Right now I'm trying out the 2 piece units, so I just. Replace the blades, and the hub stays. Also a nice way to change pitch for conditions/load.  I don't think I would see much gain on a 40hp with stainless anyways. 30mph is fast enough for me.  S."
761900,RangerGuy,2013-01-23 21:14:00,564,"hey bigbuck, I don't think I have any serious issues just set up issues.  I hit great rpms and speed at wot. 75hp yamaha tiller 6000rpm hits 38.5mph with full tank. With 2 dogs and 2 passengers I can get 36-38 depending on water conditions.  Just want to get the boat out of the water a little more for efficiency and handling.  "
761903,Terry,2013-01-23 21:17:00,14456,a merc high five will give you lots of stable lift
761916,SlowPoke,2013-01-23 21:41:00,2984,"Without looking up the specs, I'd say 6000 RPM is spinning a little quicker than necessary. I'd recommend going up a little in pitch (ex. 17 to 19) in an aluminium prop for starters and give some consideration to a 4 blade. A Vortex 4 blade can be had for about $120. Once you have your pitch & diameter dialed in you can then consider a stainless for better performance and keep the aluminium for a spare."
761950,glen,2013-01-23 23:29:00,2641,Mike check this out on your props. On my props the SS is about half as thick as the aluminium.  The leading edge is sharper too.  Get the right SS prop on there and it will do everything better.
762176,Tybo,2013-01-24 18:13:00,1373,"What slowpoke said. A 4 blade aluminium will almost give the same as a three blade SS in hole shot and top end,but not in cornering.There will be too much flex."
720553,mike rousseau,2012-08-06 13:51:00,4661,I have a stainless prop from a 50hp Honda....  Will it fit a 50hp Yamaha...?
720607,bigbuck,2012-08-06 18:41:00,2449,"Probably not. Check aftermarket props, if the x-ref #'s are the same you are in luck."
720614,davey buoy,2012-08-06 18:53:00,5505,"Worse comes to worse, take it to your local prop repair shop and trade it for what you need. The one I deal with is more than reasonable."
720680,Fish Farmer,2012-08-07 00:52:00,2234,"My spare prop for my 50 Honda is a Merc prop. Bought it from J&J Marine. That's all I can tell you Mike. The down side to a Stainless, is if you hit something, can cause more internal damage than a aluminum. You could call J&J and ask him 905 768 9188 Just a thought."
760864,welderman44,2013-01-20 11:18:00,3,"Mike  That prop should go on no problem, around here I sell aluminum props to Honda owners all the time, lots of rock here. The 40 50 and 60 hp will use the same prop, just in different pitches. We replace aluminum Honda props with Yamaha because Yamaha is easier to repair, SS props on the other hand repair very good. When in doubt look for an NMPA shop.  DB."
760867,Terry,2013-01-20 11:58:00,14456,"people don't understand modern ss props it's like the guys who tell you not to store your battery on cement old info and not valid anymore  well same with ss props  as far as I know all   newer ss props have the rubber hub in them that breaks easier then the aluminum on your aluminum props so there is no damage to the rest of your engine ss props are the way to go, unless you are hitting rocks daily"
760872,lew,2013-01-20 12:26:00,12766,I bounced my SS off rocks twice on the West Arm of Nippissing last summer and it survived both hits with nothing more than a bit of road rash.  I blame the 1st hit on Tybo and the 2nd on Art....that's my story and I'm sticking to it
760888,aplumma,2013-01-20 14:07:00,6896,Well if you hadn't been drinking and trying to show me how fast the boat could go we would have never run OVER that island. It was not the little rash on the prop that was bad it was removing the pine trees from the rub rails that made it a pain in the butt.   Art
760891,lew,2013-01-20 14:18:00,12766," Yer right Art, I should lay off those COKES when we're going warp 7"
760892,RangerGuy,2013-01-20 14:19:00,564,"I'm look'n to put a stainless on my 75 hp Yamaha this year.  I've heard some shops will let you try a few to find the right one.  Anybody know of such a place?  Also, what's the average price for 16 & 17"" ss prop.  I'm think'n on a merc 3 blade SS with the flo torq lll hub kit. I'm just not sure what model to get."
760895,lew,2013-01-20 14:47:00,12766,"Greg, I've heard it said that an SS prop won't make much difference on motors under 100 HP, but I'm no expert and perhaps someone will chime in that knows for sure."
760899,davey buoy,2013-01-20 15:00:00,5505,"In my experiance,there not good with I/O drives either."
760914,RangerGuy,2013-01-20 15:35:00,564,"Hi Lew,  I've heard that as well. I not looking for performance improvements just more bow lift and less prop cavitation.  I had to lift the motor another hole (now its on the 3 hole down) to get the cav plate 1/2"" above the bottom of the hull which should get my cav plate just above the water when running.  Currently I have to trim almost all the way just to get some bow lift.  Talking to some guys in walleye central they say Yamaha props are stern lifting props and merc are bow lifting. Not sure if there is any truth to it, that's why II want to try one before dropping 500+ on a prop haha!"
760950,mike rousseau,2013-01-20 17:30:00,4661,Thanks everyone  The dealer ended up throwing in an aluminium prop for free so there was no need to use the stainless I already had....  And he explained that there are no performance gains with a stainless prop on a 50hp...
760952,BillM,2013-01-20 17:34:00,17367,I'd like to know if a SS prop on our Yami 115 would be worth it or not...
760956,mike rousseau,2013-01-20 17:40:00,4661,From what I understand the more HP the more gain you get with a stainless.... Apparently the prop flexes on high HP motors witch means  loss of energy at the prop....
760960,BillM,2013-01-20 17:44:00,17367,"Our Lund definitely isn't a speed boat, I don't know if I need anymore mph out of it really (I can hit 49mph in it now by myself)"
760962,Terry,2013-01-20 17:45:00,14456,on my 90 hp merc  a  ss prop gave me 5 mph more and totally stopped the bow from bouncing up and down at speeds over 30 mph with the aluminum prop I was riding a bucking bronc ...
760973,RangerGuy,2013-01-20 18:04:00,564,"I've heard the same about the SS props.. They have much more bow lift. I was talking to a guy who lives in high altitude, and was loosing a lot of power on his Merc 75 hp 4S. Same boat as mine 18' Alaskan but his is a single console where mine is a tiller. With my extra weight in the back I thought bow lift would not be an issue but it is.. I can only get the front 1/2 of the boat out of the water even when alone and my cav plate was still just slightly under the water when running unless I fully trimmed out.  He said once he lifted to the 3rd hole down and put a SS Merc prop on he barely has to touch the trim to get all but the last 1/4 of the hull out of the water. So I can imagine with the right prop I probably will have to barely trim at all to lift my tiller out of the water  I'm pretty much at the max performance, I can hit 6000rpm and run 38mph gps by myself with a full tank of gas and between 35 & 38 with 2 people and my dogs (65lbs each), which is confirmed on my phone and Garmin 278c. This is plenty fast for me  LOL!  I would really like to try a SS before investing the cash tho.."
761021,wormdunker,2013-01-20 20:48:00,1711,Kawartha prop repair will test your boat with different pitch props so you will get the optimum performance.  I believe they charged me $150.00 for this service.  They are located in Buckhorn.  Give them a call.  Hope this helps.

761164,mike rousseau,2013-01-21 07:49:00,4661, Care to explain then?  We are a trying to learn about props... If your gunna say someone is wrong... You should say WHY he's wrong... So we can learn...     Also  Anyone that experienced performance gain with a SS prop... Was it the exact same pitch and diameter of your aluminum? Or different specs?   ...
