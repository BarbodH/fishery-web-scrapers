761882,Tree worker,2013-01-23 19:55:00,9,Hi my name Brian Burns. I'm from Titusville Pa. I haven't been to Canada fishing for 8 years. I'm taking my boy up and a couple of other guys to Lake sasseginaga June 15th to 22nd. Me and my brother went to other lakes for about 8 years straight but had to start all our kids weddings and that set us back but we are ready to start again. Just wondering how much fishing permits for US guys and is there any other permits for that area we have to pay for. Been to that lake once in mid July has anybody fish that lake in mid June we are staying at the outpost. Thanks for any help.
