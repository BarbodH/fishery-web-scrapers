762155,Fisherpete,2013-01-24 17:06:00,1814,"I am clearing out a bunch of tackle for my friend Al in the classifieds, and there are 4 reels that he gave me to sell that I have no clue of the value. I will do some online searching, but am looking for some help from the appraisers on this site! Two of the reels are pretty old and thought that they might have some appeal to a collector... anyways, here they are:  1) Penn Master 151 baitcaster, RH    2) Abu Garcia Ambassadeur 5600 Plus     3) Pflueger Skilkast (trademark no. 1953) also says Pflueger Summit no 1995 on the sideplate     4) Pflueger Trump (trademark no 1943)   "

762314,OhioFisherman,2013-01-25 01:03:00,6623,"Just a suggestion, don`t ever use the "" buy it now "" price to determine value. I have seen a lot of people on Ebay that try to turn trash into a treasure by slapping a ridculously high "" Buy it now "" price on an old reel they have for sale.  Not to say some aren`t a fair deal, but more people phish than people from here."
762438,Lunker Larry,2013-01-25 14:41:00,122,"I'd suggest posting them on a site where the ""reel heads"" go. Their are quite a few collectors out there. Try Alan Tani's site. You will get a response from guys all over the world. http://alantani.com/"
