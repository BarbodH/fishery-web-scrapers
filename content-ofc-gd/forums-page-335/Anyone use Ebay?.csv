597754,DundasSteelheader,2011-06-28 22:25:00,166,"Hello all, I am trying to purchase a rod blank on Ebay. Shipping to the states is about $13 which is pretty reasonable, but shipping to Canada is $31  So I have an address in the states that I could ship it to, and then pick it up in a few weeks. I go to checkout and put in my different shipping and billing addresses, but paypal won't let me  It will not allow me to use a canadian credit card and send the item to the states. Can anyone help? Is there some secret way to put in seperate billing and shipping addresses? How do you ebay-ers do this...  Thanks  Sean"
597764,Joey,2011-06-28 22:39:00,9122,"Contact the seller and tell him what you are doing, have him adjust the shipping.  Tell him what address to ship to after payment.  So have him change the shipping to $13, then pay, then he ships to the US address."
597765,danc,2011-06-28 22:46:00,4677,"I do this all the time Sean. I ship to a Minnesota address which is about a 35 minute drive from home for me. When I come back into Canada I pay the taxes. Simple as that. Be sure to bring a copy of your Ebay purchase with you, or you can be there for a long time.  On the other hand, many USA sellers won't sell to Canadians no matter what the shipping address is. Don't know why, but that's up to the seller."
597770,Dutch,2011-06-28 23:07:00,831,"This is another way PayBay screws Canadian users.  I wanted to add a US address to my PayPal account so I could ship to a freight forwarder in the States only to find out it wasn't allowed.  THere are litterally hundreds of threads on the \PayPal forums regarding this issue and PayPal still hasn't wised up and allowed Canadians to add a US Address.  I assume they think it will lead to more bogus claims, but they really need to get with the times.  Best thing to do is contact the seller outside e-bay (if it is a store) then just pay by credit card.  Really, there is no difference in going through the store itself and going through e-bay.  The seller only avoids paying E-Bay's insane fees."
597860,Bondar,2011-06-29 04:40:00,817,"Before you do the paypal thing ,  go into "" MYEBAY "" ( really your ebay )  and click on the Request a total  , it will take you into an ebay screen with the total ,  it will have your shipping address listed in the top left  under that you will see a icon in blue letters that says Change address ! click on that  type in the address you wish to have it sent to  and submit the address , then  back in the main screen request a total from the seller with your new USA shipping address and he should reinvoice you with the proper shipping amount  if you need more help PM me i ship to the states from ebay almost all the time  "
597917,Harrison,2011-06-29 12:42:00,2202,"Gents, can you have 2 confrimed addresses?  Or would the US one be ""unconfirmed' if you changed it from your Canuck address when requesting total?  I know some sellers will not ship to an unconfirmed address."
597922,craigdritchie,2011-06-29 12:59:00,1586,"So far as I understand it (and I may be wrong) the only ""confirmed"" address is the one that your credit card is associated with. The only way to have a confirmed address in the US is to have a credit card drawn on an American bank, with the home address recorded as being in the US. It can be done if you have relatives in the US or own property there ... it's just awkward."
597956,DundasSteelheader,2011-06-29 14:57:00,166,"Thanks for the replies everyone.. The only problem with that is once paypal sees the $13 US shipping it will no longer accept a canadian credit card   Yea, I figured. Unfortunately a lot of small businesses and ebay sellers are only set up to accept paypal, they can't take straight credit card   "
597965,Joey,2011-06-29 15:15:00,9122,"  Are you sure about that, have you tried it?  I am the ebay ""shipping bargain queen.""  I rarely pay the Canadian shipping.  I always ask if I can get a lower shipping price and 9 times out of 10 they will oblige.  I just wait until I win the item, then I send a ""request for total from seller"" and they can put in whatever shipping price they want."
597979,John,2011-06-29 15:43:00,2956,"I have 3 addresses on my PayPal account, the confirmed address which is the same as my credit card/bank account, a US address in Buffalo NY and an office address. I have shipped to all 3 using PayPal with no problems with over 300 transactions. It's a matter of setting things up correctly."
762436,doser,2013-01-25 14:38:00,7,"I use paypal all the time to purchase site-to-store at Walmart USA, use paypal for all my eBay purchases and have them shipped to American-Mailbox.net in Niagara Falls.  Directly across from Seneca Casino at 256 3rd Street.  Good location, good hours and low rates.  To purchase online at Sams I buy gift cards in person and use them for online shopping.  If you buy a lot of American goods you could also open up a bank account at M&T bank on Military Rd in Niagara Falls.  You get a Visa Debit card and free checking.  No monthly charge and they even pay you a little interest.  I tied this account in with my 3rd street shipping address as some US retailers that don't take Paypal insist the billing and shipping address match.  My daughter did all her Xmas shopping online."
762451,BillM,2013-01-25 15:28:00,17367,"Is your Paypal account verified?  If not, this is most likely the reason why it won't go through..  I never have issues paying for anything via Paypal.  Even shipping to a US address and my Canadian billing address.."
762566,solopaddler,2013-01-25 21:39:00,8605, This is exactly right.
