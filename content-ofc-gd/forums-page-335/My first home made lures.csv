761996,Freshtrax,2013-01-24 02:06:00,2215,I call them .... Simcoe slammers..  The one on the right I bought for 50cents at a garage sale a few years back and it's brought it's fair share of lakers to the topside of the ice.   Well I decided I would try my hand at making a few extras.  No laughing.  The one on the left I added a stinger .  Planning on attaching a lively minnow on there to see if I can catch a few more whitefish with it.  Next thing I would like to try is floats on a lathe. Anyways thanks for looking.

762001,kemper,2013-01-24 02:28:00,2232,"I learned quickly after going artificial-only for a season of steelheading that ""pretty"" jigs don't catch any more fish than ""ugly"" ones. More than anything, I think size and profile are the most important.  If the old one worked - so will your new ones!"
762017,NAW,2013-01-24 02:46:00,4022,Those should work great.  Good job man!
