Only one area that I would have to stay clear of is half way across you can clearly see this area as it just frooze up ...and not a good Walleye fishing area anyways  in a couple more days it will be just as safe. Tons of good ice now time for me to find some Eyes chow for now. Hope to see u all on the ice this weekend maybe we can even have a little derby for the die Hards. And as always use Caution ;D "
