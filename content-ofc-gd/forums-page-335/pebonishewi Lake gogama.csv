762545,walleyebob,2013-01-25 20:11:00,27,"I was wondering if anyone has been to this lake in the past. What is the fishing like? The ontario fish eating guide only lists northern pike, are there any other species? There is very little info on this lake online. Is there an outfitter on this lake? Any other help would be appreciated feel free to PM if you like.  Thanks walleyebob  "
762555,kickingfrog,2013-01-25 20:39:00,8333,I can't speak to that particular lake but most in that area are typical pike/walleye/perch/whitefish lakes. Hopefully someone has more details for you.
