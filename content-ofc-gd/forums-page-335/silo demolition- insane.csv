761973,IndySKS,2013-01-24 00:52:00,134,"Well i guess not many people can say this but...Been there done that !  We used to demo a lot of barns when i was in the Excavating business, silo's were the funnest. Back when dynamite was easy to get we used that but as it became harder to get we moved on to pushing them over with an excavator, sometimes hired the local redneck that for some reason had a suppply of TNT ( i didnt ask why). One of the last ones we did was one of those slab type silo's and we(my brother) had the brainwave to poke a few holes in it and do some fancy weaving with some heavy cable and then pull the cable down with the excavator. Well the landowner thought we were nuts and filmed the whole thing. Lets just say basket weaving wasn't my brother best trait. We pulled the cable and about 1/2 the slabs that were supposed to come out actually did. Guess who had to finish it with a sledge hammer. Thank fully it landed right on target, i was less than 20 feet away from the base when it landed, the whole time hearing the landowner repeadedly yelling RUN.  Someday im going to drop by and see if he still has that tape."

762308,IndySKS,2013-01-25 00:49:00,134,"No I cant say i remember that one, I never cared much for being in a machine while taking one down, especially a payloader"
