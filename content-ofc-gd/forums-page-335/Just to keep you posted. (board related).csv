761706,Roy,2013-01-23 01:41:00,13728,Some of you might have noticed a slowdown in board speed earlier this evening. Our server people received a greater than anticipated influx of traffic over the last 24 hours and this slowed us down temporarily. To correct the situation they have moved some people off the grid and will be moving a few more overnight. We should be good to go now.  Thanks for understanding.
