762126,Oggie,2013-01-24 15:02:00,588,Just a heads up that Belwood Lake near Fergus opens for ice fishing on Friday.  No hut rentals anymore but bait and tackle are available.  $5.50 per adult to fish $2.75 for kids.  Easy walk from the parking lot down onto the ice.  Call Park office for details. 1-519-843-2979 Dan O.
762134,Burtess,2013-01-24 15:20:00,901,My 11yo daughter has been bugging me to get her out but I was hoping Valens or Pinehurst.  Neither of those will be open this weekend.  How is Belwood for fish volumes?  I really need a spot that can give consistent action (like Pinehurst for bluegill).  One pike for the day will not do it for her lol....  Burt
762166,iFish4real,2013-01-24 17:41:00,386,if u want action don't go to Belwood
762174,registerfly,2013-01-24 18:05:00,198,I second that...

762321,Burtess,2013-01-25 01:14:00,901,How is the parking situation at Gilford?  Or parking at any other recommended area right now on Simcoe?  Never fished it.... and we would have to walk out...  Burt
