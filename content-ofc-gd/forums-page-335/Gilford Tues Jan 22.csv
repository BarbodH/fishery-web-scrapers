761825,RickOnt,2013-01-23 14:44:00,669,"Out yesterday AM at Gilford  -18'C when I left Home and -16'C when I got back  It was cold all day.  The ice was moaning and growing  My camera did not like the cold either so I have a Pic of the first hole I cut and thats it!   About 7"" of good clear Ice        There were not many Pic worthy Fiish anyway  I fished 4 spots and all holes I drilled were about the same ice.  LOTS of Fish, Would of been a great day for my Grandson, You could hardly get the Jig to the bottom without having a fish on!! but I had a hard time finding any over 10"" and most in the 7-8"" area.  I did get enough decent size ones for a meal  The travel was very good a little broke up at the shore but once you get on smooth running a bit of drifted snow but not much, With the past warm temps and now the cold all the broken ice from the air boats is pretty well smoothed out  The Slab Grabber and the Forage minnow did most of the catching But it was one of those days that just about anything worked.  Terry Goy, and Ice Cabins have huts out  See Ya on the 'Hard Stuff' Rick"

761827,Oggie,2013-01-23 15:10:00,588,"My sons and I were out Monday. You're right about lots of smaller fish.  We did land two jumbos in the 13-14"" range (measured) but released them to spawn. I like the 10-11"" fish for eating.  Geez we caught alot of herring.  At least 6 in a five minute time period.  Released of course. You can see them come in through that 6"" of clear black ice.  Trecherous walking guys so bring your cleats or your hockey helmet!  Dan O."

761840,RickOnt,2013-01-23 16:19:00,669,"Oggie  The kids musta had ""Fun""   The 9""-11"" are good eating size.   Mike  I had the Hut and some Heat   Too old for the Bucket thing in -18'C   LOL  Rick"
