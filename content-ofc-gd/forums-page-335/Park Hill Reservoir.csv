This weekend I plan on hitting up some ice fishing, yet I wanna kill two birds with one stone and have to maintain my wood duck nesting boxes in the Park Hill area, which just so happens to have a large reservoir nearby.  does anyone know the conditions on the ice at the Parkhill reservoir?  does anyone have any tips for catching fishes through the ice at this reservoir?  I hear there is pike and crappie (and some other fish I dont care about), but havent found any online reports or anything to reference.  Thanks in advance and I wish you good luck and safe fishing this weekeend!!  "
