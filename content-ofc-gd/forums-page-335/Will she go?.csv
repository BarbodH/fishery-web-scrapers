760495,BillM,2013-01-18 23:08:00,17367, Check those water levels before you go
760499,misfish,2013-01-18 23:18:00,29133,"  I did drive to check (10 minute drive from my front door) ,and check THE site. It,s all good,IMO"
760506,misfish,2013-01-18 23:58:00,29133," LOL It,s here now Wayne. It,s warming up already here. LOL"
760552,lookinforwalleye,2013-01-19 02:51:00,4399,Where is the who gives a flying fedoooooo box?
760567,Cudz,2013-01-19 03:48:00,2652,Bill's Jetta is a Diesel.  Probably the best looking jetta wagon i have seen
760569,Cudz,2013-01-19 03:49:00,2652,What does this mean?
760570,Freshtrax,2013-01-19 03:54:00,2215, Right next to the Habs suck box.  Q.  Why do I like to ride In The car with a Canadians fan? A. Because I can park in the handicap spaces.
760580,Joey,2013-01-19 04:52:00,9122,"January 17, 2013    January 18, 2013  "
760783,Rizzo,2013-01-20 01:22:00,4754,great pictures Joey...must have been real cold that night! Big change
760896,misfish,2013-01-20 14:48:00,29133,"Well what was in the bay is longggggggggggggg gone. 3+waves and white caps,heading right over to the east side.  Hi ya Rog."
760900,kickingfrog,2013-01-20 15:03:00,8333,The one bit of solace is that at least now the surface water temp is about as cold as it can be with-out being frozen. Translation: When the winds calm and the temps drop it should freeze quick.
760901,davey buoy,2013-01-20 15:06:00,5505,"Especially with this weeks daytime highs!(below -10),night time obviously colder!"
760926,BillM,2013-01-20 16:23:00,17367,"Yup, shouldn't take more then a few nights to skim back up...  As long as we can get a few inches before the winds pick back up and rip it apart again."
761912,Freshtrax,2013-01-23 21:37:00,2215,Well I think we're in the clear.  Pretty sure there will be 4-5 inches most popular spots this weekend.  Stay safe everyone if your not familiar with the big lake tag along with someone for the next two weeks.  I voted kemp only.   Now fess up who were the 10 negative Nancy's who voted for boat only.
761922,BillM,2013-01-23 21:53:00,17367,Will be a interesting weekend.  Everyone be safe out there.
761934,fishnsled,2013-01-23 22:32:00,3520," Well I was one of the 3 that voted for ""All the way"".  Hoping she will hold but I wouldn't trust it just yet.  One windy day like last weekend and she'll open up again.  Thankfully the winds are not looking too bad over the next 7 days.  Fingers crossed.  Everyone be safe out there!!"
761935,misfish,2013-01-23 22:42:00,29133,"Seen the forcast for today. The temps were right,-30,but they said there was a north wind at 0 kmp.LOL  Got 2 more days for more thickness. It,I hope,will be good to go. Im not saying out in the big waters,but sheltered bays."
761939,dhickey,2013-01-23 22:52:00,1038,Its here finaly I can feel my fishdar booting up...   Yippeeeee
761941,RickOnt,2013-01-23 23:00:00,669,Yes Things are looking good for 'Oro to Georgina'  In most areas there is enough Ice to withstand some wind!!  Not the 70 Km stuff from last Sun but some.  Rick
759805,Freshtrax,2013-01-16 23:22:00,2215,Just for fun 
759813,misfish,2013-01-16 23:41:00,29133,"Kemp,if the winds are still,and that warm air stays away."
759822,BillM,2013-01-17 00:08:00,17367, Agreed.
759826,ketchenany,2013-01-17 00:22:00,3229,"What ever it does, BE careful. A bad at home  is better than getting rescued or looked for.  And yes, I have taken some chances which I now regret when I look back."
759831,misfish,2013-01-17 00:28:00,29133," Until then Bill,Im buck hunting on Saturday."
759845,irishfield,2013-01-17 01:34:00,26272,"Don't give it much hope.. looking at the 14 day temps and the winds that go with them, but Temagami will be crackin and poppin with a entire week below -25C !"
759847,misfish,2013-01-17 01:37:00,29133,Lucky you guys.
759849,irishfield,2013-01-17 01:44:00,26272, Probably won't matter to me at this rate.. we can't plan anything as we have no surgery date. By the time we get one... it will be too late for anyone to book the time slot off.
759850,Cudz,2013-01-17 01:44:00,2652,I hope she freezes.  Hey Brian I saw guys on the 'other spot' today.  I might be able to get out for a few hours Saturday morning. Interested? Edit:  Oops!  Just read that you would be buck hunting Saturday.  lol
759855,BillM,2013-01-17 02:00:00,17367,"Chris, bucks as in giant chromers!  I also saw you driving twice today"
759859,misfish,2013-01-17 02:13:00,29133," Wayne.I know,I meant if you get up there,you be a lucky to be on some good ice."
759861,misfish,2013-01-17 02:15:00,29133, Next weekend buddy. Give mother nature time to redo her job.
759881,BillM,2013-01-17 03:26:00,17367,"I might join you fellas if I don't get out before then.  I'll grease you out if I'm not officially invited, lol!"
759889,irishfield,2013-01-17 03:50:00,26272,Already some pretty good ice Brian. Probably enough to drive my truck to the dock now..... too much work in the shop to play for a bit and we'll wait and see what happens for February.
759916,Cudz,2013-01-17 05:46:00,2652,"Yeah I thought hunting season was done. Bill, 23rd makes sense to me.  Gives me some extra time to get a pass from my wife too. Make that the 26th.  I need to get some sleep."
760436,Freshtrax,2013-01-18 20:31:00,2215,Well from what I've heard it went.  Now lets see if it can make it through sat.
760456,misfish,2013-01-18 21:46:00,29133,K BAY IS ICED OVER FOR AS FAR AS THE EYE CAN SEE.
760466,irishfield,2013-01-18 22:07:00,26272,Snowing heavy right now.... and +2 then rain overnight and tomorrow... if the ice stays it should soak the snow and lock it all together.
760468,BillM,2013-01-18 22:09:00,17367,All my fingers and toes are crossed!
760469,misfish,2013-01-18 22:09:00,29133,"Im in no hurry Wayne. I,ll  give mother nature all next week to really give the lady a good lock up. It,s good new for the Tyler event."
760470,misfish,2013-01-18 22:11:00,29133," Bill heres something I noticed different. You know where that hole was always open out in front of the fountian,well thats even froze. I guess moving that pipe out further,means theres going to be a soft spot some where out there. I know that pipe goes out past Minets now,but where it ends,I have no idea."
760471,kickingfrog,2013-01-18 22:17:00,8333,You could flush your phone and then use gps to track it.
760474,misfish,2013-01-18 22:20:00,29133, 
760482,BillM,2013-01-18 22:48:00,17367,"Brian, I can't believe the bay has skimmed over..  That's insane!  The only ice I saw yesterday was in the harbour and right by the fountain.. the rest was wide open."
760489,misfish,2013-01-18 23:00:00,29133,"Well my friend,jump in the jetta and have a look. It,s happening.  For now,I,ll be fishing the running waters til next weekend."
