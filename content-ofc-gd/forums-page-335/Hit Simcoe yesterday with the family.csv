Picked up a homemade hut from a guy and wanted to give her a try. Was going to go to Port Bolster but had a change of heart last minute and hit Guilford instead. Glad we did we were on fish right away and had action all day. Got there around 11 and left at 5:30.  Heading out   Jake wanted to pull   Not working so well   Got the hut set up in about 30 seconds   Drilled a couple holes   Plenty of room inside as the wife is taking the pictures   Boys having fun   Got a lot of dinks and a few jumbos. Mostly on live minnow   Heading home....notice the feet on the hut lol

761735,moxie,2013-01-23 02:59:00,1566,Good for you. Thanks for sharing. 
761756,Jet,2013-01-23 05:05:00,364,"That's what it's all about!  I find ice fishing is a great way to introduce new people to fishing. I bring new anglers out and if we don't catch fish, the food, drinks and scenery almost always ensures a good social time."
761777,solopaddler,2013-01-23 11:43:00,8605,Awesome. Looks like a whole lot of fun!
761793,mr blizzard,2013-01-23 13:16:00,1589,"Nice pics, great way to spend the day with family, nice to see some of the cold air is finally making its way down to you to make some decent ice."

761969,Guest,2013-01-24 00:39:00,0,"Glad you got some action.  Was out there today got a 100 perch with 15 keepers.  Largest one was 12"".  No herring though, but caught a few last week.  The sounds of the ice scared the crap out of me all day.  I ran out of the tent haha.  Ice was almost 9 inches though, but it was still a good scare.  everything was caught on a frozen dead minnow."
761989,FisherJuli,2013-01-24 01:36:00,125,"Nice post- looks like fun for the kids, and you got a yummy catch, too!! Now, I'm really itching to ice fish his weekend!!"
761997,FisherJuli,2013-01-24 02:09:00,125,"Hehehe... Well, I can't promise anything, but as always I work hard to give him a run for his money! ( and he loves every minute of it!!) :-)"
