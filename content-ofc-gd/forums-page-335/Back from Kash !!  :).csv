762054,chris f.,2013-01-24 04:05:00,95,"Hey guys,...So we got up to the lake by noon wednesday the 16th, on the ice and set up by 3pm. smokey warming up the old wood stove lol   realized that i forgot the waterproof camera i bought for the trip, so another friend was coming on friday and would bring it.. pictures were late coming and we missed alot of good pice due to being spread out on the ice with only 1 camera  old walter that was on the wall when our family bought the cottage in '83... 29.5"". unknown weight  the bay... -9c when we got there and you can see the open water from the rapids to the right, so it was slow going spudding and drilling holes across the bay  thinnest ice we saw on the path to the walleye gounds.. this being 6-8"" in the middle of the channel leading from the rapids, flowing out the narrows.  around 5pm and set up over10-25 feet of water between 2 weed beds with a nice drop off. lots of drilling by hand, as the jiffy felt like taking a nap on us for the first 3 days lol. headed back into the camp by 6pm for a night of drinking and an attempt at an early bite...  thursday moning... -21 overnight and could hear the lake poppin' and gowing all night   -19 at 6:30am. if you notice the open water is not so open lol ready to go  tip up #1... one of dads old home made bad boys  first we jigged up the perch, hit about 15 or 20 between 7 and 8 am. kept 4 or 5 that were a pound or that were messed up by hook set then the eyes moved in.. 1st one was small thru it back, next was a pound and a half, then 2 and a half, then my tip up #1 went off like in jaws.. bzzzzzz  he took my reel almost all the way down to the end, then after pulling him up 3 times to the hole, pulled me right back to the bottom twice befoe poking its head outta the hole  29.5"" on the wall...  and my P.B out of my collage lake Kashwakamak.. 27.2"" and 5.89lbs.. gonna link the video of the fish on the scale once its on you-tube ate dinner and went back out for the evening bite...  this is my friend scott.. walking outta the darkness after being saved by the man in the float suit moments before  .. we heard the famous last words "" hey i'll show you how safe it is ""  then splash.. into 30 feet of water. lol at least he has a smile on his face, and not too far to shore on the quad...  this is where i went to take a leak.. and found that the sun had beat down on this log all day.. nuff said.. picks in the sleeves guys  and this is a man size hole...  where i'm standing in the pic below it is 6"" thick, but we all know what the log did to the ice around it.. i guess scott forgot lol..  so after 20 minutes in the cottage infront of the fire and a few pops, we head back out...     then the next nite afte chumming the water with scott's stupid ass.. he gets one..    and the final tally for the 3 days scott and his brother jay were there, they left friday.   from the top.. 5.89lb, 2x 3.4lb, 3.2lb, 2.1lb walters, and those size perch were hitting all week long with reckless abandon lol.. got and thru back a few smallmouth and a little white fish too.  cold weather hitfor a few days and winds up to 70mph caused the bite to slow for a few days, and i think thats why the trout wouldn't bite ..? oh well, good week all in all  and i'm gonna get up there once more before ice out!! can't wait to do it all again   Cheers boys.. be safe lb   "
762069,Nipfisher,2013-01-24 05:56:00,2449,Good fishing. Can you drive right to your cottage?
762070,chris f.,2013-01-24 06:10:00,95,"thank you  yes most times you can drive right in if you have 4x4, but there is a clear cut just off the highway we plow and 2x4 cars and trucks can park and we go in on the quad or sled. There are a few year round cottages too, so the roads are usually pretty decent. I had to drag my fiends mini van up a hill with the chains so he could get out on monday lol"

762085,Rod Caster,2013-01-24 11:54:00,5784,Fantastic trip! Those walleye have shoulders. That log thing would have ne a little nervous about walking around in the dark trying to take a leak haha.

762292,chris f.,2013-01-25 00:12:00,95,"lol, ya he lost his humility fairly quick.. its ususally not that bad near the log, but the warm weather and sun all day, thinned out the ice good lol  i am hoping to make it up a few more times before ice out and have more than enough room, if anyone here is close enough to me to make the trip. dates to come soon and details to come upon request... thanks guys for the comments"
