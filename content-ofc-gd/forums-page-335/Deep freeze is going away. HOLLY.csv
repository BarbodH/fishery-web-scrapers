762616,mr blizzard,2013-01-26 00:15:00,1589,"I used to like u misfish lol,    as we were from Barrie and all .  Winter is  awesome at least up here. Still -40 windchills at night. Went up to a balmy -24 today, enough to melt off the frost from the windows, can see outside again  . Colder air coming here again next week thankfully, We'll try to send some more down you way for those hard water fishermen and women. Nature walks are those romantic gushy things you do in the summer  .lol"
