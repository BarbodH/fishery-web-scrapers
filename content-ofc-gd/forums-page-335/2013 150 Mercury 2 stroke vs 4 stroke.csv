762383,Hooked,2013-01-25 05:13:00,891,My brother is getting a new boat and is conflicted by which motor he should get.  He is looking at getting a 20' Legend Xcalibur.  Which motor would you all recommend to go with it?  Has to be Mercury.  Thanks.
762386,Pigeontroller,2013-01-25 05:40:00,2793,"Get the 4 stroke, and put in on something other than a Legend. Tell him to check Alumacraft pricing..."
762391,Terry,2013-01-25 10:10:00,14456,"I looked at an 18 foot Legend  they  wanted 16,000.00 with a 50 on it..a 50 to upgrade to a 150 they wanted 18,000.00 more which meant they wanted more the 22,000.00 for that engine  oh to  answer the question, go with the 4 stroke"
762392,spincast,2013-01-25 10:16:00,3279,4 stroke.
762396,Rich Clemens,2013-01-25 11:03:00,3131,Get the 4 now.  My last boat had a 2 stroke and I regretted that decision and should have spent the extra $$$$.  When I got a new boat - upgrading to the 4 stroke was a no-brainer.
762405,ecmilley,2013-01-25 12:35:00,2163,4 stroke for durability
762433,ratherboutdoors,2013-01-25 14:26:00,132,"4 stroke, should he ever have to sell it..."
762442,lew,2013-01-25 14:54:00,12766,"I drove a 90 HP Merc 4 stroke for 9 years, then sold it to a bud who's had it for 4 years now.  To this day it's never had a single issue and runs as good as the  day it was originally purchased.  Regular maintanance and a bit of TLC and they'll go forever.  Great motors."
762460,Cast-Away,2013-01-25 15:53:00,790,"6 year ago half of the replies here would have been 2 stroke, now 4 stroke is unanimous. Have a 1999 Merc 4 stroke on a 17' Legend and love it. I can easily pull 2 water skiers. Funny enough the chassis is Merc and the engine block is a Yammy."
762479,captpierre,2013-01-25 17:30:00,2521,"It used to piss me off to pay a marina $250 in the fall the do the routine end of season service required for my 2007  4 stroke 115 Yammy/Lund.  That pretty much ate up the fuel savings for the year.  But now I do it myself for about $80 and using Yamalube oil (expensive)  The quietness of the motor, lack of smoke and no need to use 2 stroke oil are the benefits.  Extra cost initially and extra weight are downsides.  Also lack of hole shot, especially when loaded, also not as good."
762481,Hooked,2013-01-25 17:36:00,891,"Thanks for your replies boy's, I have relayed the obvious answer to him.  I think he just ordered it too.  Can't wait to check it out!  That thing is going to boogy."
762507,lookinforwalleye,2013-01-25 18:24:00,4399,"Nothing wrong with a 2 stroke if it`s a Opti, love mine.  Second the Alumacraft statement!"
762573,John Bacon,2013-01-25 22:14:00,3277,"Is the two stroke an Optimax or a traditional two stroke?  There is a big difference.  I would still take a two stroke if there is a big price difference.  I saved ~$3,000 by going with a two stroke when I bought my boat.  I don't that that a four stroke would save me $3,000 in gas."
762584,mike rousseau,2013-01-25 23:17:00,4661,On a 150 I think the four stroke would easily pay you back in gas savings depending on how you fish... and As long as you plan on keeping the boat for a while... And if you don't the 4 stroke will pay you back on resale.....  But I'm looking at this as a troller......if I go out for 10 hours my motor runs for 10 hours....  I had a 25 merc 2 stroke and my 50 Yamaha 4 stroke burns around the same as the 25 did in a day....
762612,John Bacon,2013-01-26 00:09:00,3277,"The   The $3,000 savings was for a 50hp.  I do a lot of trolling with with but I still only but about 10-15 liters per outing, max.  That will be a lot of days of fishing before I save three grand with a four stroke.  The savings on a 150hp would be higher, but I think the price difference would be too.  You could probably buy a kicker for less than the price difference.  I am not convince that I would get it back in resale value either.  As a matter of fact when I had my boat at the marina for a new prop; the person I was dealing with mentioned that people would be willing to pay big bucks for my motor because they don't make them anymore."
762620,Muskieman,2013-01-26 00:21:00,2472,"For a smaller outboard on my boat 14 ft no brainer, 2 stroke , 4 stroke 70lbs more .  Larger boat ( 17.5 hopefully in April) will for sure have a 4 stroke ."
762713,Hooked,2013-01-26 05:49:00,891,For some reason the 2-stroke is $300 more?  
762715,Gerry,2013-01-26 07:36:00,257,"I'll go against the grain here and state that 2 stroke, DFI engines are better in the higher HP ranges, i.e. 150HP and up. The newer DFI 2 strokes are as good or better in fuel economy and emissions, while the power to weight ratio puts the 2 strokes at a definate advantage. To say that a 4 stroke is better overall is simply not correct. I've attached a couple of indepedent articles on this issue and I would advise anyone to read them carefully. I have owned DFIs', Mercury Optimax (225HP), and I must state that in my experience they have been very reliable and best for me. I insist on good acceleration throughout the power band and in my opinion 2 strokes deliver this much better than 4 strokes. in the lower HP range, i.e. under 70HP, 4 stroke is the better option except for weight. In the 70HP to 150HP range, it's a tossup. I also own a 4 stroke kicker motor and these are better for trolling applications.  http://www.idofishing.com/forum/showflat.php/Number/20670/fpart/1/dfi-2-stroke-vs-4-stroke-outboards  http://www.allatsea.net/southeast/outboard-engine-roundup-examining-todays-two-stroke-engines/,"
762777,fishnsled,2013-01-26 17:45:00,3520," That is a XS Optimax they are showing, it's a performance motor and probably why it is more expensive.  A regular Opti will be cheaper."
762780,Steve,2013-01-26 17:55:00,2075,gotta love the legend.  comes with a 75 but can put a 150hp on it....  nothing a stock motor at 50% capacity.  sigh.
