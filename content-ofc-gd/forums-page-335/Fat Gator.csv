761844,grimsbylander,2013-01-23 16:32:00,3016,Congrats on an awesome pike! That fish must have been a sight coming through the hole teeth first.
759309,dheitzner,2013-01-15 01:07:00,314,"Been a while since I posted a report, but I'm still getting out on the water as often as I can. Was happy to drive a couple of hours north in the fog on Saturday morning to spend a day fishing on one of my favorite bodies of water.  I had heard that there were some decent pike in there, and we got into a few smaller specimens along with some really nice (although unfortunately OOS) smallies throughout the day.  As we killed the last few minutes of our outing, I was rewarded with this fatty that hit a drop-shotted minnow in 21fow.  After a 15 minute battle with some really blistering runs I iced her and after a few quick pics and measurements, back down the hole she went.  I revived her with my hand in the water for 3 or 4 minutes, and with a quick flick of the tale...gone!  Taped out at 42.5"" with a 20.5""girth, and was fat all the way down her body. Thanks for looking, see you on the water... Darcy "
759310,Rich Clemens,2013-01-15 01:08:00,3131,Truly awesome.

759331,kickingfrog,2013-01-15 01:39:00,8333,And when I looked down the hole all I could see was one eye.
759346,jedimaster,2013-01-15 02:10:00,3472,Holy lizard. Nice one!!!!
759348,BillM,2013-01-15 02:17:00,17367,That's a nice fish!
759350,trevy727,2013-01-15 02:20:00,351,"Nice fish Darce, I'm still getting out in the boat. We need to go together some time. Maybe bring Tom."
759352,nancur373,2013-01-15 02:36:00,1211,whatta tank. I'd like to get one like that in the boat let alone on the ice. Good job landing her
759368,jim,2013-01-15 03:06:00,124,She looks like a pig!!!
759377,funfishing,2013-01-15 03:32:00,147,...
759382,kickingfrog,2013-01-15 03:45:00,8333,A 20.5 fish would be just over 6 inches in diameter if it was round.
759385,Slop,2013-01-15 03:59:00,151,Very...very nice slobby ice Pike!
759387,NAW,2013-01-15 04:01:00,4022,Very nice fish!!!
759392,Pigeontroller,2013-01-15 04:27:00,2793,VERY nice Pike!
759401,Garfisher,2013-01-15 07:09:00,229,What a pig! Approx. 24lbs according to In-Fisherman
759403,davey buoy,2013-01-15 09:03:00,5505,"A 8"" augered hole would be large enough!"
759404,lew,2013-01-15 09:24:00,12766,"Yeah, that's a very impressive pike for sure, well done !!"
759410,skeeter,2013-01-15 11:47:00,1907,"That's not a tank, that's a freight train!!!  What LB test line?"
759428,dheitzner,2013-01-15 13:48:00,314,"Thanks for all the kind words folks. The fish was caught north of Parry Sound, but south of Sudbury on a small body of water, on 8lb test line. Although I likely could have squeezed her through an 8"" hole, I was really glad that I bit the bullet & dragged around the 10"" Jiffy all day (especially when she was at the hole and I was trying to turn her head! lol)"
759432,mike rousseau,2013-01-15 14:02:00,4661,Super tanker pike...  Nice catch
759434,Jds63,2013-01-15 14:03:00,1365,Good job Darcy !! Thats a beauty for sure ....
