600745,tomO,2011-07-08 21:59:00,363,I bought a bottle of 2 cycle oil and didnt realize it was synthetic till I was getting ready to mix it with the gas. I went ahead and filled the can. I got to thinking later I've still got half a tank full in the boat and would it be ok to mix that gas with the  regular 2 cycle oil and gas mix in the boat tank. thx.
600751,Tootsie II,2011-07-08 22:32:00,162,"I use the synthetic all the time. My understanding is that a modest amount of mixing with regular 2 cycle oils is Ok, occasionally but not recommended to be done as a matter of practice. I guess you didn't notice the price when you bought it cause synthetic is about twice the price of regular oil. I will never go back to regular 2 cycle oil. My weedeater, chainsaw and outboards run smoother and cleaner with the synthetic. Just wish I had friends who regularly travel to USA. Apparently, it's a lot cheaper there. The info on the co-mixing came from  the Amsoil website under the Interceptor brand name of oil."
600757,tomO,2011-07-08 22:53:00,363,Yea it was a little pricey I thought but I got it at a little outa the way store I was in a hurry and about half asleep. I.ll run the boat tank about dry then I'll use the other. thx.

600783,BillM,2011-07-09 00:12:00,17367,It's not going to hurt a thing.  Most synthetic premixes are compatible with conventional premix oils..  What does the bottle say?
600969,hirk,2011-07-09 17:07:00,571,yes no problem
600982,RyanT,2011-07-09 18:26:00,72,I've done it a few times in different motors.  Didn't seem to matter.
601096,Billy Bob,2011-07-10 12:37:00,5865,No problem....there are even synthetic BLENDS available.
