600918,danjang,2011-07-09 13:07:00,148,I was wondering if anyone had fished  the Mattawishkwia River  in Hearst. I am going on an away job there for a few days and would love to know what I should bring as space is limited. Knowing what I can catch there would be awesome as well. Any help would be greatly appreciated   .
