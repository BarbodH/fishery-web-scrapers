600964,vinnimon,2011-07-09 16:20:00,2593,Sweet deal B
600981,Terry,2011-07-09 18:23:00,14456,"I am glad you made the most of the day   I spent the day reading a book called ""Golf made easy""  a day golfing is better then a day trying to get the trailer, the motor the trolling motor the.everything else going  the only thing I can't figure out and I really don't want to do and I don't see why you would want to do is... use the things called Tees  I mean driving is hard enough why would I want to put my balls on a tee when I am driving..I just don't get it..you think cell phones distract divers..that would drive me nuts........."
600985,trevy727,2011-07-09 18:40:00,351,Truck Tonneau Cover. Not tunnel
600986,Spiel,2011-07-09 18:43:00,9065, That's a fact!  None the less it looks great Brian.  Just need a nice shiny Lund behind it now.
600987,misfish,2011-07-09 19:26:00,29133,"    Potato ,patato,you call it wnat you want.   Thanks Chris. What a great deal.  I would say,a savings of over 3/4 the price,I can call it what I want.  Terry,I grabbed a bag of tee,s.I agree. Texting while driving is much easier, or is that more comfortable.  ."
600988,Joey,2011-07-09 19:37:00,9122,"Great price for that B  Yup, sometimes things happen for a reason.  Maybe Terry is destined to be the next Tiger Woods, minus the scandal of course (unless you want a scandal Terry )"
600992,irishfield,2011-07-09 20:00:00,26272,Terry's always involved in some scandal.....

601003,mercman,2011-07-09 22:03:00,7054,I am fully bummed out for you Terry.Golf isn`t all that bad. Some courses have ponds with fish in them so bring along your rod. Just stay away from the golf carts and anything else mechanical
601026,NAW,2011-07-10 01:17:00,4022,Lookin sharp Brian!

601105,Grimace,2011-07-10 12:52:00,2020," So Tiger Woods is driving through Newfoundland with his shiny new BMW and he stops for gas.  The gas attendant is admiring the nice spiffy ride.  As Tiger gets out of the car two tees fall out of his top pocket, as he bends down to pick them up the Newfy says What are those for?  Tiger says to put my balls on while I drive.  The Newfy says Oh My Jesus those Germans think of everything."
601108,Handlebarz,2011-07-10 13:11:00,3790,"  Terry unless I haave been not getting much sleep I would think that might just be a offer you better send Paul  email with  the GPS cords to the limits of lakers you and Brian got and thn see if Joey stays home, if so your in and better get there fast as you know Pual will be back soo since his guide stayed behind aand he could not find the fish."
