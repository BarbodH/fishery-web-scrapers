600586,craigdritchie,2011-07-08 14:47:00,1586,"The whole flap over E15 fuel gets better by the day. The latest news - Jeff Wasil, emissions certification engineer for Evinrude, just testified at a US congressional hearing and absolutely slammed the EPA’s proposal to increase the amount of ethanol in pump gasoline from 10 percent to 15 percent.  Speaking to the Energy and Environment Subcommittee of the House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology, he presented all sorts of technical reasons why ethanol is “completely incompatible” with boat engines.  If you’re really into this stuff (and you would enjoy picking through 54 pages of techno-babble), you can click here to download a transcript of his full presentation.  At the end of the day, it's important to remember that the push to increase the amount of ethanol in pump gas from 10 percent to 15 percent comes from ethanol producers who want to sell more ethanol. It has absolutely nothing to do with decreasing emissions or lowering the price of fuel. The soft parts in an engine (gaskets, seals, fuel lines, etc) are built to handle 10 percent ethanol in the fuel. Increasing that amount to 15 percent is a big enough deal that it will cause damage that will not be covered under warranty. A dozen car companies said as much earlier this week, and boat engine manufacturers have been saying it since day one. This is scary stuff, folks. Gotta keep on top of it."
600600,hirk,2011-07-08 15:20:00,571,"Something missed here is that stabilizer is intended to delay phase seperation brought on by ethanol if gas sits.The biggest threat from ethanol if you use your engine regularly is fuel system degredation (lines/gaskets)if they are not ethanol resistant which applies too any engine more than approx. 10yrs old give or take.The lines rot on the inside and your engine ingests the crap,not good.Change old lines and use stabil but realize the ethanol is still there eating your lines even if you use stabil so just change the lines too the new enthanol resistant type.On the octane thing I ran a high compression Merc with fixed timing and new dfi engines may be able to compensate for and prevent pre-detonation due to low octane but carbed and efi can't,end result with them would be a big BOOM if ya run octane too low for your compression.So your wasting your money running prem with a 87-89 rated engine."

Kerry"
600873,danc,2011-07-09 03:54:00,4677,"You guys fret too much about this stuff. My boat is now 10 years old. It's a 2001 Lund Pro Sport with a 60 hp 4 stroke Merc. Sometimes I put stabilazer in for the winter. Sometimes I forget. And my off season is 8 months long. I never put it in during the open water season. It has always started with a second or two of cranking in the spring. And it runs like a dream each and every summer with last years gas. Yes, 8 month old gas. Sometimes treated, more often not. It's carburated if you're wondering. Same goes for my battery. I charge it in the spring and it's good for the summer. In fact I'd bet that it would start the boat without a charge in the spring and keep me going all summer. It's the original Merc battery that came with the boat. 10 years old. I have given the boat a good drink of Seafoam each spring for the past couple of years. I'm pretty sure that I've noticed a performance increase.  Anyways, that's how I look after my investment. It works for me. Maybe I should read more about this stuff? Or maybe I should just keep puttting gas in the boat, turn the key, and go fishing. I'd hate to have a fuel issue when my boat is 15 or 20 years old.."
600882,SRT8 smoker craft,2011-07-09 04:56:00,1107, I would use sta-bil marine ethanol treatment (the blue/blackish stuff) not the red for storing it .Adds pennies to the tank and I can't see it hurting anything even if it's not really doing much it's better than having a dead engine while on the water.

They also said that there were no advantages with using todays Premium (commercially available). My neighbour runs at least 100 hours a season and has used Regular gas in a 90hp 4st Merc for over 10 years with no hiccups.

600048,Raf,2011-07-06 20:24:00,3495," Make sure you know what you're saying.  In today's motors, running 87 in an engine designed for 91 or higher will not blow it up, melt pistons etc.  The ECUs will idiot timing in order for the engine to run safely without pre-ignition/detonation. This comes at the cost of performance when running crap gas.  It is a safeguard from poor gas or your wife pouring 87 in your hot rod.  Hot rodders advance timing to take advantage of higher test on motors designed to run 87."
600054,Garnet,2011-07-06 20:43:00,2056,Raf you right. Was just trying to keep it simpler for non gear heads.  Unless you want a basket of broken parts just run what the manufacture suggests.
600057,BFSC Kevin,2011-07-06 20:53:00,1351,So high octane is no good..... So ethanol is no good........ So best choice is....... 87(my engine's recommendation) octane with sta-bil!

600070,Fisherman,2011-07-06 21:29:00,7201,"The best choice of gas for any particular motor is probably what is written in the manual that comes with the motor when new, or quite often on line for second handers.  A quality stabilizer or product that prevents additive(ethanol) separation is also advised.  I think as long as you keep your tank(container) sealed from outside air unless underway, will keep out a lot of the moisture.  If you use the motor on a regular basis, I don't think there are any worries either.  Gas that sits around for any period of time, vent open, etc is more likely to cause you grief.  Solution... go fish often.  BTW, I wonder how many have really, really have read their motor manual before they flung it in the corner."
600079,Fish Farmer,2011-07-06 22:00:00,2234,"I use what is the cheapest, I just filled for a $1.09 Lt. on the Rezz.. If my gas sits longer than 3 weeks I use Stabilizer. Why would anyone buy a motor that burns the most expensive gas?"

600106,craigdritchie,2011-07-06 23:55:00,1586,"Thanks - been following it very closely for some time now (among other jobs, I sit on NMMA Canada's board of directors, so it's very much on my personal radar). And, I do write about it. Situation changes on a daily basis though, so it's always a challenge to stay on top of it.  Long story short - this won't go away any time soon. And, there's a whole raft of all-new fuel tank legislation coming down the pipe that's indirectly connected. If and when it happens, it will raise the cost of a new boat by $500 to $1,000 right from the get-go. Boat manufacturers are going nuts, and rightly so.  Politicians are delighted to hop on the environmental bandwagon right now because they think it's what everyone wants. But there's so much misinformation and just plain bull being spread right now (sorry, mods no problem I fixed it for you  ) that some of these politicos are making decisions based on sketchy science and half-truths.

600110,Garnet,2011-07-07 00:05:00,2056,That's great the angle I was thinking was using higher octane than manufacture suggested and how you are wasting money and polluting or water ways more than necessary.  Many believe it's a cheap ticket to better performance and better for long term engine life.  Find your local speed shop and they will tell lot's.
600115,misfish,2011-07-07 00:14:00,29133,"I run regular in the bayliner. It,s a regular motor after all. I add stabil for piece of mind. Now I have to ask this question,and feel free to call me stupid,it wouldnt be the first time here,but,,,,,,,,,,,,,   How is cleaner fuel polluting? Cleaner, is pretty much green to me."
600116,Big Cliff,2011-07-07 00:19:00,6899,"Use the grade that your manufacturer reccomends for your motor. Save yourself a lot of money and time trying to out guess the guys that desigined your motor, they might not be the brightest bulbs in the string but they do know what they are talking about when it comes to that motor. (or at least they should)  Use a good quality fuel stabilizer. You will stop a lot of problems from ever happening to your entire fuel system. You have a lot of good mechanics on this board, listen to them once in a while!"
600123,aplumma,2011-07-07 00:38:00,6896," Brian if you have a motor that is out of tune (timing) then it will pollute more due to the fact it is burning the gas at the wrong time and the exhaust port opens and lets raw fuel exit from the exhaust. Now if we increase the octane and make the gas more stable than the manufacturer wants it to be it in effect changes the timing. Now this applies to mainly to the older motors that are not computer regulated which will vary the timing to combat changing conditions and quality of fuel. Now with that said the higher the octane the more you can compress the fuel before it explodes that is why as you modify a engine (raise compression) you need to increase the octane to keep it from knocking. Knocking is were the the explosion happens before the top of the stroke and is actually the motor exploding the piston backwards counter productive to the inertia of the rotational energy of the motor. Stick with the correct octane, add additives that prevent the fuel from breaking down due to contact with air and moisture (marine Sta-bil) and tune the motor when it is not running correctly.  Your motor will happy and healthy for many years.  Art"

599915,Garnet,2011-07-06 14:17:00,2056,Some miss the point with premium gas. It really has a lower flash point and takes more compression to get any value from premium gas. If your motor is rate for 87 octane it only has the compression to run 87 octane. Most outboards are rated for 89 octane because they have the compression to run 89 octane.  You run 94 octane in a 87 octane motor you are pissing raw fuel and dollars into the lake. Sea Foam and the sta bil help protects.  And I do run the Shell 89 octane if available.
599924,Raf,2011-07-06 14:40:00,3495,Ethanol is actually an octane booster.  It allows gas cos. to use a lower grade of gas and bump the octane value up using ethanol to meet vehicle requirements.  Sunoco I believe was the 1st to start using ethanol and are (along with PetroCan now) the only ones to have 94 octane -- with 10% ethanol.

The other side is people that put 87 octane in high compression motors (require 94). They say it's all bull I'm saving money.  What happens is your piston are getting close to TDC (top dead center) and the compression ignites the gas. So your piston is going up when the explosion happens. This breaks valves, burns holes in piston spins bearings and ultimately blows holes in your cylinder walls. Very expensive lessons.  Back to running 94 octane in 89 octane motors. Hot Rodders do this stuff by retarding time changing fuel flow and messing with other stuff.  Make sure you know what you are doing."
