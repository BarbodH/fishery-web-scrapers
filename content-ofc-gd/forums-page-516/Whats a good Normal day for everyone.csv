600571,mike rousseau,2011-07-08 14:24:00,4661,I think your andwers she be based on home waters or mist frequently fished waters... For me that's 98% st.lawrence river
600572,BillM,2011-07-08 14:27:00,17367," Yup.  If I can go out in the evening for 2-3 hours, boat a couple, miss a couple I'm a happy camper."
600588,jimmer,2011-07-08 14:54:00,2730,"What's normal???? Example: Check out some of the weigh-ins at a bass tournament. Top team has 21 lbs and the last place team is skunked. Maybe the bottom ten have weighed in one or two bass. The next tournament might be completely different and those guys on the bottom are now the top ones. Are you fishing a kawartha lake or a northern little lake that no one fishes? I've had a 25 fish 4 hour excursion, then lucky to catch one the next day. I have fished Paudash lake and caught 10"" fish all day long, I don't consider that a highly successful day, but it's sure fun if you have something grabbing at the end of your line. I agree that if I'm catching 2-3 fish every hour, I'm having a good day."
600590,4x4bassin,2011-07-08 14:59:00,1025,To me like some guys have said it's not about the numbers it is the quality of fish being caught and just getting out in the boat with friends and having a good time !
600597,Terry,2011-07-08 15:18:00,14456, you're killing me  I live too far away to spy on where you go...........LOL
600612,BillM,2011-07-08 16:29:00,17367,"I think a lot of people here better get on the tournament trail with the amount of fish they are catching, lol.  This sounds a lot like steelhead fishing"
600640,Joeytier,2011-07-08 16:52:00,3990,"LOL.  Oh man, the amount of 20 lb. steelhead I've heard of getting caught just the day before...they never seem to have pictures though even though half of them are spouting away on their crackberries the whole time."
600649,Harrison,2011-07-08 17:00:00,2202,"I measure the day as a winner if I am able to put something together and dail a pattern down.  If I don't, it challeges me to come back again and try.  That's what I love.  The hunt.  As for bass, sure I can get 40 fish a day, maybe only a couple over 2lbs though.  OR 6 or 7 bigguns for 8 hours.  I lik'em big.  Hero or Zero even while fun fishing for me.  Do not use fishnig shows as a gauge to your fishing ability.  Just don't."
600657,mike rousseau,2011-07-08 17:24:00,4661,  do i smell a trip trade????
600423,coreyhkh,2011-07-08 00:49:00,163,Hey guys I am just wondering what everyone normal catches are. For me it depends on what Iam fishing for but if its bass then 10 in a hour is good.
600429,beginner,2011-07-08 01:10:00,542,my normal day would be.. if every cast I did catch fish... that would be normal.. but then again I never had a normal one..  10 bass 1hr would be really good.. lolz
600433,Rizzo,2011-07-08 01:16:00,4754,"If I was catching 10 bass an hour I would quit! For me a big part of fishing is the challenge, that's why I'm 90% of the time fishing for musky. Regularly get skunked, regularly catch 2 or even 3 in a day. I figured it out a couple of years ago, I average a fish every 6 hours or so...in the meantime you've caught 60 bass!"
600437,lunkerbasshunter,2011-07-08 01:23:00,2585,It depends on the lake and the fish.  I would say 5 to 10 smallmouth bass and hour would be average on a decent lake.  on a great lake it could be as high as 20 an hour.  Cheers!
600438,mike rousseau,2011-07-08 01:27:00,4661,10 walleye in 2-10 hours between 2-5lbs  1-3 musky in 3-10 hours 35-42 inch average  50-60 perch per person... 20-30 are 8-12 inches in about three hours  1 carp every 30-45 min averaging 20lbs
600441,gaspumper,2011-07-08 01:30:00,393,"Some of you guys better join the bass circuit somewhere,catching that many bass an hour."
600443,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-07-08 01:35:00,0,"i've had great days with walleye,bass, and trout where i've caught dozens of fish.  i've also had days where i've caught nothing.  part of the allure i guess."
600444,mercman,2011-07-08 01:36:00,7054,  You`re gonna be my new best friend Mike
600448,misfish,2011-07-08 01:50:00,29133,"  Size matters,quanity dosent.LOL"
600451,splashhopper,2011-07-08 02:03:00,2931,a normal day of fishing has me searchng for a place to park my vehicle to sleep in for the night. Then go back at it the next day and then drive home.... completely exhausted and looking at my gas guage thinking.... Loblaws fish counter looks cheaper every week.
600459,Pikeslayer,2011-07-08 02:37:00,1443,I'm not normal .
600460,mercman,2011-07-08 02:43:00,7054,"  You and me both Simon As a matter of fact, I`m downright ABNORMAL"
600492,steverowbotham,2011-07-08 07:43:00,1800,Lets be real. 2-3 quality bass an hour is an excellent day.
600502,fish_fishburn,2011-07-08 10:27:00,1311,10 an hour?  I fish the Ottawa River mostly and 10 Quality Bass in 8 hrs would be a great day. I guess thats what keeps me going back. For me its all about the hunt.
600504,Terry,2011-07-08 10:32:00,14456, same here I really want to go fishing with a few of these guys  
600512,HTHM,2011-07-08 11:10:00,4082,"I thought it was called fishing not catching.... A normal day for me, 0.  A day when I am out fishing 'bout the same....*sigh*"
600527,lookinforwalleye,2011-07-08 12:11:00,4399,"10 bass/hour I`d like to see that, do you guys edit your days like the TV guys???"
600534,ChrisK,2011-07-08 12:27:00,2772,"I don't know about you fella's but to me a good normal day on the water means no stress,no pressure and a lot of good quality time spent away from work."
600536,craigdritchie,2011-07-08 12:28:00,1586,"A ""good day"" has nothing to do with numbers.  Having said that, I would agree with Steve ... in the real world, 2 or 3 good bass per hour is definitely good fishing."
600537,mike rousseau,2011-07-08 12:30:00,4661,  Serious... Last night I got 11 walleye in 2.5 hours...  Ok... Maybe saying 8 would be a better average... But I did boat 17-13-16 walleye this year in a day...  One of my best days this year was 10 carp- 16 pike- 6 oos smallmouth- 5 walleye...  And altho it's been a slow start to musky this year... Iv got a fish everyday but one... 40-41-43 inches
600541,mike rousseau,2011-07-08 12:42:00,4661,"  Keep in mind I'm third generation fisherman on the greatest river in north America... The ""Larry""  My dad and grandfather were both guides and me and my brother get to fish 3-4 times a week... Each... And share all info... That's like being on the water every day... So we know what's going on with the fish..."
600549,Dontcryformejanhrdina,2011-07-08 13:17:00,535,"I've had days (not often) where I literally caught 20 bass in 1 hour, but only 3-4 of them were bigger than 14"" and nothing larger than 3lbs. Then earlier this year I went fishing and only caught 1 fish which was my biggest bass ever, a 7.5lb+ largemouth. 3 Pickerel in the morning/evening is good for me, too.  I only fished for bass growing up since I never had a boat and I lived close to lakes that only had bass. This year I finally bought a boat and I'm getting into musky and pike fishing in the last few weeks. I still haven't landed a musky but I hooked into one a couple weeks back and jumped out of the water right in front of me and got off. I was pretty heartbroken lol but I later caught my first 3 pike that day, biggest was 30"" so that helped out a bit and turned out to be a pretty good morning. Unfortunately I had to leave the cottage we rented that afternoon.   A normal day bass fishing would be about 3-6, if it's literally all day than 10 or more, but anything over 4lbs is a treat since it usually doesn't happen. I better get used to being skunked though, since I'm planning on casting for just musky until I get one (maybe I'll still try for some pickerel) and I'm still learning.  This year has been my best year of fishing by far, and it's not even over."
600557,limeyangler,2011-07-08 13:28:00,5204,"Fun post  I think for me it depends where i'm fishing.....but wherever it is i dont like ""the dreaded skunk"", a good day on the water is better than a bad day......yada yada yada!"
600563,eman,2011-07-08 13:53:00,101,you guys have must beaty spots!  If I catch one bass an hour (15-16 inch keeper) I'm happy. Or one big bucket over 3.5lb a day I'll be pleased. I normally fish heavily pressured conservation areas.
600567,Brettiop,2011-07-08 14:17:00,279,"This is such a ridiculously hard question to answer lol....  Way to many variables to consider...  It depends on where your fishing/what your fishing for/what the conditions are/boat or from shore/how much beer Ive consumed/Going for numbers or size/who your fishing with.  On some northern lakes you can catch fish until your arms fall off, some places you have to work hard for every bite....i cant even construct an answer that would be remotely accurate."
