Jennifer McCart of Redbridge pleaded guilty to discharging a firearm in the traveled portion of a roadway and for possessing moose unlawfully hunted. She received a $3,000 fine and was given a one year hunting suspension.  The moose meat was forfeited to the Crown and a firearm seized during a search warrant. The firearm will be returned once the fine has been paid.  Patrick McCart of Edmonton pleaded guilty to transporting a moose that was unlawfully hunted and received a $1,500 fine.  According to a news release issued Friday morning by the Ministry of Natural Resources, details of the October 18 incident were revealed in court last week.  ""The McCart's were returning home after moose hunting for the day. While driving on Songis Road in Phelps Township, just north of North Bay, they rounded a corner and saw two moose standing near the centre of the road, near the crest of a hill.""  The release further states Jennifer got out of the vehicle, stood on the road and fired a single shot that killed the moose. They gutted and transported the moose to Jennifer's residence.  MNR conservation officers acted on information from the public and executed a search warrant where a firearm and moose meat were seized at Jennifer's residence.  Fish and Wildlife officers from Alberta and the Ontario Provincial Police also assisted in the investigation.  To report a natural resources violation call 1-877-TIPS-MNR toll-free anytime or call Crime Stoppers anonymously at 1-800-222-8477."
