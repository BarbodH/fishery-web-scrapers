600424,LefroyFisherman,2011-07-08 00:52:00,602,"Just got back from a couple hours on cooks bay for pike, managed a solid 30 incher and a very nice 35 incher that fought harder then the 41 I caught a couple weeks back.  I've been reading all these posts about people being 's on the water, I had one this evening as well, had the whole lake and he chose too speed past me at about 25 feet. Damn good thing I wasn't in a 12 foot tinny.  "
