601012,ThatGuy,2011-07-10 00:42:00,3,"Greetins everyone ... new to the forums (well back after a few years of minimal fishing and I cant recall the initial user name) ...  I have the option of fishing either Rice Lake or the Ganaraska (Port Hope) on Sunday ... Any recommendations? The Ganaraska would be from shore, saw a few smallies pulled in tonight but the action was slowwwwwww. I found a place that will rent a boat on Rice for me (about $20 per hour if that sounds fair).  The questions I have are ...  1. $20/hour a fair cost for a boat rental. 2. The boat rental will give me some sort of 1 day boaters card ... is this legit? 3. Of the two options which would be better for a morning of fishing? I can get some worms/minnows from around the corner where I'm at.  Thank you for any information provided and I look forward to posting a report. "
601014,Roy,2011-07-10 00:50:00,13728,Welcome aboard. I imagine the price is about right.  It's legit. You don't need a boater's card when renting a boat. Only people who have driven boats all their lives need the boating education.

601019,kickingfrog,2011-07-10 00:55:00,8333," Given the number of complaints about various types of boaters on here in the last few weeks/months/years we need more, not less, boater edumencation."
601054,ehg,2011-07-10 03:06:00,2666,Without a doubt hitting Rice Lake in a boat is way better. Even if the bite for bass or walleye is slow there is always tons of sunfish or perch to keep you busy fishing. The possibility for a musky even exists on Rice.
