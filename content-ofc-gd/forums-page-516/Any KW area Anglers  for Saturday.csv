600327,torco,2011-07-07 18:07:00,656,I'd be in probably for next weekend if I don't get away to friends cottage on Rice. I am babysitting this weekend as Mom has to work. Wet wading for smallie's is right up my alley though.
600413,crappieperchhunter,2011-07-08 00:07:00,2582,My old stomping grounds. I'd be all over it if I still lived over that way. Good luck getting someone to hook up with.
600428,Musky or Specks,2011-07-08 01:09:00,2710,Well the plan is to not actually fish in KW but some of my lesser known honeyholes but leave from KW Not lookinhg like anyone is too interested though. If you have a flyrod we could make it bass and brookies or if u just want to learn to fly fish I'll be your guide for brookies and learning the hows of flyfishing. After we slay bass all morning.
600468,Victor,2011-07-08 03:22:00,1609,frozen-fire and I actually do plan on hitting the Grand sometime in the summer for some river smallies.  We probably won't get to it till maybe August though. Will for sure send you a PM when we do figure out when we're going.
600507,Musky or Specks,2011-07-08 10:44:00,2710,I'm going to withdraw the offer other plans have reared their head.
