600932,Broker,2011-07-09 13:54:00,482,"So every year i go to killbear provincial park for 3 weeks and i was wondering. Ive never had any luck up there and i only have a kayak , any suggestions on what to do?"
600935,barrystrs,2011-07-09 14:05:00,75,"I love that area up there, but I don't catch much either.  The channel to long lake from blind bay has coloured water and I used to catch more, but it doesn't have the same appeal as the sparkling water."
600943,Broker,2011-07-09 14:28:00,482,"Last year i fished the little lake on the bumpy road into the park , im looking forward to fishing it now that i have a kayak , i only fished it for an hour from shore and hooked into a pike , little but promising .. And a few bass and perch . But ive neve had any luck with fishing in the park"
600946,danjang,2011-07-09 14:46:00,148,Go out into the bay clearing the shallow water off the cliff jumping rocks. Just jig large spoons around 50-75 ft? You'll catch Lakers.
600949,Broker,2011-07-09 14:52:00,482,  would i be able to do that in a kayak.. ahha?
600954,danjang,2011-07-09 15:02:00,148,I did it with a canoe! All I did was cast as far as I could with the wind to get an idea of how much line I had and just let the wind drift me towards where it landed. That should be enough time for the spoon to get to depth then start jigging! I caught 5 doing this in about 3 hours.
600958,Broker,2011-07-09 15:20:00,482,"  haha alright thanks! I'll try it out , never caught a laker before !"
600965,d_paluch,2011-07-09 16:33:00,343,"killcoursie bay is closed for trout allyear. that little lake (raby lake) has pike as stated.  killbear is an amazing campground, just wish there were more easily available fishing spots"
600967,danjang,2011-07-09 16:58:00,148,Just went over the regs for Lakers at killbear and d_paluch is correct. Were the boundaries changed in anyway over the last few years? I recall checking and double checking and asking locals. It was a 0 Limit not an all year fish sanc.
600968,Broker,2011-07-09 17:03:00,482,"have you gotten much pike in raby lake? ive only fished it for an hour when we were leaving and caught a small pike, didnt know if it was a fluke or not..  "
600971,Broker,2011-07-09 17:23:00,482,also for the pike were you fishing in the weeds on the sides of the lake with weedless lures or were you out in the middle.. leaving tommorow for 3 weeks and wanna make the most of my time there lol
600974,d_paluch,2011-07-09 17:41:00,343,"just tossed a spinner like bait, let it sink for a few seconds then a steady retrieve straight into the middle of the lake.  had no luck along the weeds unless I was cheating and using worms, but then it was just sunfish  good luck n have fun. been going there for the past 4 years, even witthout fishing the time spent there was amazing"
600979,Broker,2011-07-09 18:17:00,482,"i agree this is my third year , an i think the pike i caught was just along the weeds .. Cant remember aha. also seen a guy pull in a 6 pound smallie !"
