600293,Dave Bailey,2011-07-07 15:23:00,1641,"Slow day so I decided to head down the road to the bay and see if that might provoke the boss into beeping me. Decided to go very simple and rigged a Slammer weedless and threw it toward the cattails. As soon as I started reeling I felt resistance, the guy must have hit it the second it dropped in the water! He managed to get wrapped up in some weeds but fortunately they weren't rooted so I just hauled the whole bunch in. Not a big one but better than sitting at home waiting for a call! Spent about another half hour, got a couple of soft strikes but that was it.    "
600296,Joeytier,2011-07-07 15:42:00,3990,Good goin.  Lots of largies in there if you cover some water.
600307,spinnerbaitking,2011-07-07 16:16:00,1622,Great way to kill an hour or 2 SBK
600329,maybo,2011-07-07 18:09:00,86,"I fish there for carp for a long time, never know you can catch bass there. You must have a boat I suppose"
600401,Dave Bailey,2011-07-07 23:34:00,1641," Nope, didn't even put the canoe in. I went to the Progress Frenchman's Bay East Park, on Front Street."
600485,maybo,2011-07-08 04:45:00,86,alone the shore line? good catch dude
600487,irishfield,2011-07-08 04:47:00,26272,"Nice to see you out wetting a line Dave! I should have brought a rod... we have our other 2 ""kids"" in the Westin Harbour Castle right now..."
600535,Dave Bailey,2011-07-08 12:28:00,1641," You certainly should have brought your gear, you're not far from some excellent bass and pike fishing. The water at the base of Spadina is actually being managed for pike spawning, and the islands are well known for being a great fishery."
600538,Harrison,2011-07-08 12:31:00,2202,Vous Menteur! There's no bass in there.
600577,Rattletrap2,2011-07-08 14:31:00,1652,Can't beat that! Nice fish!
