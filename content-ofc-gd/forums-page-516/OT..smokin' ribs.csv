600742,Rodwrap,2011-07-08 21:44:00,130,"  The old adage ""They're done,when they're done"" applies here. Different cookers cook differently. ( my old horizontal cooks with gentle smoke & takes a little longer than say a drum smoker).  The outside temp. makes a difference, too, as does wind.  But these went 5 hours at 250-275`  .........  My drum smokers do it all in 4 hrs. with a smokier flavor.. "
