600951,Rod Caster,2011-07-09 14:55:00,5784," It's tough to get a consistent walleye bite unless you have a honey hole.  I like to search for them by casting 1/4oz jigs/grubs and hoping them off bottom or using a worm harness and spinning it near bottom. If they are there and feeding, chances are with those baits you'll get a few taps... from there you can hone in on them either using faster or slower tactics. Good luck, I'm sure others will have great suggestions."
