She loved the idea, but I wouldn't be able to offer her a suggestion as to where to go. Do you know a place that would be good that offer something like this?"

It was a float plane and he insisted that She come with us! We actually went a lot further and flew over several lakes. He asked if I wanted to to land on any because he was an Instructor and was certified on a large number of lakes to land. I told him I could go for a ""boat ride"" any day and said I wanted to stay up for as long as possible! It was a good time!"
