600573,Nipfisher,2011-07-08 14:27:00,2449,"Since the last update on my Lowrance, I am having problems with the Navionics chip...or the unit. I have been out twice in the last little while on big lakes that don't evemn show on my screen? It shows my trail and coordinates, but no lake image. These lakes are not ones that are featured on my Canada chip but they used to still show as bodies of water. I reset to default settings but it made no difference. The chart function is useless right now unless I am on Nipissing.   Any ideas?"
600575,mike rousseau,2011-07-08 14:30:00,4661,Call lowrance...?
600587,Terry,2011-07-08 14:52:00,14456,did you change the map setting from lowrance to Navionics in menu and put it on the right map region
600594,Raf,2011-07-08 15:08:00,3495,what terry said
600642,Nipfisher,2011-07-08 16:53:00,2449, Thanks. I have it on the navionics chip. Not sure about the map region. Any idea where it is in the menu? Like I said in the O.P. It shows Lake Nipissing just fine but Trout Lake which is 10 minutes away doesn't even show up on the charts.
600645,Dan668,2011-07-08 16:57:00,1120,"I got my new hds 7 last week, forgot to switch it to navionics, so i didnt have the maps. First time having a gps finder but i figured it out rather quickly setting the whole unit up.  Just noticed that the lake isnt on navionics, i havent been on a lake to see that problem arise so cant help ya there. I would call lowrance."
600648,Nipfisher,2011-07-08 16:59:00,2449, Mine was working 100% before this last update?
600650,Dan668,2011-07-08 17:01:00,1120,"I updated to the newest, used the settings i found on BBC forum in the states. The sonar sucked, so i downgraded back to 3.5, you could always do the same? Or are you happy with the new update?"
600706,Terry,2011-07-08 18:52:00,14456,oh yeah  hds 7 should see the chip when you put it in and ask you if you want to use the info on it  you can put it in when the unit is on and it should see it
