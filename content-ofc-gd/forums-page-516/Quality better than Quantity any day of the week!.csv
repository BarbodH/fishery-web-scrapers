601087,Terry,2011-07-10 11:30:00,14456,ah the great trips we have been on
601102,kickingfrog,2011-07-10 12:48:00,8333,"I may have missed this the first time around, although I know I've seen that trout of Wayne's.  Tough to beat a trip with friends.  Interesting when old threads come up to see who posted and who is still active on the board... At least I find it interesting."
601121,irishfield,2011-07-10 13:52:00,26272,Terry must be gettin close to taking up golf.... bringing back up 3.5 year old posts!!!
601122,Terry,2011-07-10 13:55:00,14456,yup  at this point it's golf or paintball.... paintball is year round
162050,Spiel,2008-02-19 19:19:00,9065,....So that's all I missed out on due to having a lousy job that keeps my bills paid! Screw the job I gotta be there next year.  In fact I'll book vacation to ensure it.
162055,TennesseeGuy,2008-02-19 19:23:00,957,Great trip.  Great report.  Nice of you to teach that bunch how to catch fish.
162060,irishfield,2008-02-19 19:29:00,26272, You know what they say Bud ! Three strikes you're out... you've had TWO !
162065,Spiel,2008-02-19 19:38:00,9065," ....No worries Wayne, I get an extra weeks vacation next year and I know where I'll be slotting it."
162066,TroutnMuskieHunter,2008-02-19 19:38:00,1362,I'm already working on a trip up there for the 2009 ice fishing season opener for Lakers  .....
162067,irishfield,2008-02-19 19:43:00,26272,"I was going to do another trip up to the lake before closing Steve and put some lads together for it... but I can't make any plans until we get this week over with at least. Will know more tomorrow night I hope. Still waiting to hear back, based on pre-op today, what time surgery is tomorrow... so I can get my butt to TO later tonight or early tomorrow.  Hopefully they're not getting snowed on up there...like we are down here right now... as it shows -20's for the next week or so and that should lock some of the mess back up out on the lake."
162071,gekhunter,2008-02-19 19:52:00,61,great report and beauty laker!   Greg
162074,TroutnMuskieHunter,2008-02-19 19:54:00,1362,My arm could get twisted for 1 more trip up there this winter Wayne.....hope all goes well with your daughter's surgery!!!

162157,trapshooter,2008-02-19 23:19:00,1234,Way to go boys.  That's an awesome laker Wayne.  Must have been a thrill to catch through the ice.  Congrats!

162184,Mike the Pike,2008-02-20 00:28:00,3421,As usual always enjoy the annual trip at your cottage and this year you caught a real beauty of a Laker  Did Ron have 4 wheel drive or did he manage to ride through your tracks?  MTP
162186,irishfield,2008-02-20 00:30:00,26272,We both have 4 wheel Mike... but I think I would have made it in 2 wheel with Terry's ATV in the box. Wouldn't have got off with 2 wheel drive though on Monday!
162189,johnnyb,2008-02-20 00:34:00,3413," We've got a few pics to upload from Jessy's camera....just for posterity    I think I've figured it out...here goes!  This should be one of Jessy's lakers   An OOS smallie I pulled out of nearby Cassels lake on Monday   The release shot of said smallie   And it appears we have another shot of ""Scoutmaster"" Terry's controversial yet effective firestarting techniques....

162263,Mike the Pike,2008-02-20 03:41:00,3421, OK Terry I don't get it coming from the guy who showed me how to put my camera on lanyard kept inside my survival suit it has never frozen up since.Could it be the windchill from the sleds and quad?
162284,Crazyhook,2008-02-20 05:04:00,1154,great report! awesome pics!
162311,Terry,2008-02-20 10:59:00,14456,"it was about -45 with the wind chill I took  the camera out snapped a picture and it frozen or locked up and the batteries died, they were rechargeable batteries and they will not recharge, they are dead...now that's cold"

161876,irishfield,2008-02-19 04:54:00,26272,"I left all that mizery out of the post Kyle. I got stood up not only from the guy that was supposed to lend me a double trailer...but my back up stood me up as well. I then did a lot of calling to get a trailer at 8Pm the night before we left. Dano dropped his sled at a shop that promised it would be done in time for leaving...and at the last hour he had to bum a sled as well and was fortunate enough to get someone that not only stickered a machine, but put insurance on it for him as well the day before we left."
161877,walleyemaster,2008-02-19 05:02:00,325,WOW nice pictures ..im heading up to temagami on feb 29the 4 nights 5 days cant wait we usually fish temagami and kokoko ..dont know where you were exactly but looks very nice..this is my third ice fishing trip to temagami and let me tell you its like gods country..ive fished the spring and summer in temagami for many years but only recently have i enjoyed the ice fishing there and i have to say ice fishing is my favorite on lake temagami...
161878,fatherof3,2008-02-19 05:12:00,1769,great report and congrats on the fish
161879,cisco,2008-02-19 05:27:00,597,Really enjoyable read Wayne! Congrats on such a great laker too! Beautiful patterns on that fish. Prime breeder there!

161888,lew,2008-02-19 09:00:00,12766,"Thanks Wayne, reading tales like that is a great way to start a day !!"
161889,Tarzan's Jane,2008-02-19 09:01:00,1183,"That was a great read, loved the pics...but -30  bbbrrrrr  bet you got a tongue lashing regarding that ear... Wishing your daughter the very best."
161890,Dano,2008-02-19 11:01:00,719,"Yea, I had a great time. It was nice stopping in and chatting with Bernie for a while and seeing his operation. I was hoping to bring a couple of eaters home, and thought we'd do real well since Wayne and I were on to fish the first hour but I guess with the unstable weather patterns (nothing to do with our fishing skills...lol) it was a tough bite.  I'm definitely going to take a page from Ron and Llloyds' book next year and bring some smaller stuff for the whitefish. On another note, I bought one of those Pack Shacks last year and this was the first trip I have actually used it on (C'mon, it was minus 31!) and it fell apart the second day, so be careful if you are thinking of getting one. Mind you, it was pretty comfortable untill then.  As always, there were lots of laughs and friendly teasing regarding each others fishing prowess. Great bunch of guys to wet a line with and I look forward to future trips."
161891,Rich Clemens,2008-02-19 11:11:00,3131,"Great report Wayne.   Never been ice fishing in my life and other than looking freekin' cold, it looks like a lot of fun.     Of course ... hope your daughter comes through with shining colors."
161893,Terry,2008-02-19 11:17:00,14456,wow 5 days sure go by fast..never a dull moment I had a blast...next time I will be taking monster tubes and some dynamite

161945,tinbanger,2008-02-19 14:57:00,1028,Quite the fish there Wayne ...bigger than any of my Muskies  Wait I havn't caught any !  Great time had by all it appears .   Best wishes to your daughter for a quick recovery ..need anything give me a shout  TB
161954,mistyriver1,2008-02-19 15:31:00,600,Excellent report Wayne.    Good crew with you.  Was that laker a PB ?
161960,Landlocked,2008-02-19 15:40:00,171,"SWEET!!! Nice fish but the expression on your face is definitely ""priceless"" Good times, good times!"
161962,irishfield,2008-02-19 15:40:00,26272,Thanks everyone for your comments and well wishes too. Yes you can have a great time... even without fish.... with a gang like this that's been brought together by a fishing forum or two.  Thanks Dave... should be good but I've got your number in my phone just in case.  Jim..yes PB for me open water or ice.  Was hoping the others would add some pics or do a thread of their own. Realized I was the only one with a camera most of the time. Terry got a few videos I think. Ron and Dan never had their cameras on the ice I don't think and Lloyd was too busy slaying whities to leave the tent!
161965,LeXXington,2008-02-19 15:45:00,1928,"Great report and pics, Always  fun reading about the 3 amigoes"
161967,Cookslav,2008-02-19 15:51:00,1457,That Laker is a beauty!  And I imagine shes got room to grow yet base on the size of her yap! Nice haul for sure.
161975,Reef Runner,2008-02-19 16:08:00,980,"Congrats on the PB laker. That thing is huge  Sounds like you guys had a real good time out there. But -31, shhesh, bring on the spring.  Thanks for the report.  reefrunner"
161977,Basskicker,2008-02-19 16:11:00,421,Congrats on that huge Laker Wayne...must of been an awesome feeling.....and I thought there were no fish in that lake lol.  Jason
161979,Bernie,2008-02-19 16:12:00,3190,Looks like you guys had a great weekend too. Congrats on the PB Wayne! Nothing much better than good friends and a weekend get together.
161987,Hawg Hunter,2008-02-19 16:29:00,204,"FANSTASIC report i enjoyed reading it,what a great time you lads had,nothing better then good friends out for a few days fishing,the grins say it all besides the fish really are just a bouns to add to the outing. WTG  Hawg Hunter"

162042,Tomcat,2008-02-19 19:05:00,395,Thanks for sharing your report and pics Wayne. Congrats on your beauty laker!! Sure brightened up my day - seems like all I do is blow snow this winter.
161810,irishfield,2008-02-19 02:22:00,26272,"Waited a year to get our group ice fishing trip to Lake Temagami off to a start and here I wait for Terry and Dano to show up with their stuff, 9am Thursday Morning.    Right on schedule....arriving within minutes of each other, we loaded Terry's Quad and then Dano's sled and the TON of stuff they brought. Thank goodness for a large supply of ratchet straps!    Ready to roll and Leah out to see us off, despite the fact she shouldn't be out in the cold. Gotta love a women that stands behind what you do 150% and came out to say hi to the lads.    She also of course came out to take a picture so she could post an amber alert for us if we didn't return. Terry, myself and Dano.    Shortly after leaving my laneway we had the opportunity to pick up some free meals.    A non-eventful 4.5 hr drive to Temagami and instead of finding an iceroad to greet us, that my neighbour usually has plowed, we found 12"" ++ of snow on the lake. Choice was unload and sled everything out..... Or go for it! We picked go for it and had no problems getting the  ¾ mile out to my island, did about a dozen circles to pack a parking area and unloaded.    Dano, got to shoveling his favourite trail! And I went in and turned the power on, and got the wood stove going.    Then we got all the machinery unloaded and our stuff into the cottage.    Had some supper and went out and drilled some holes just off the island to see if we could get a few pickeral.....while waiting for Ron and Lloyd to arrive. They got delayed due to an accident on #11.....but arrived around 9:30 PM. Ron.... via cell phone with me..... attempted to  negotiate the path I left in the snow, with a bit of wandering one side or the other, making it out no problem either. We helped them unload their gear and we settled in for the night of laughter, fish tales and other lies.  Got up bright and early.. thanks to Lloyd and his 6am alarm. Had a quick breakfast and got ready for the run up the lake.... About 8 miles!    Tried out my new ice finder. Had some battery issues, but Ron had a spare that he was nice enough to lend me.    Dan, Terry and I set up on a 20 to 30 foot hump..     and Ron and Lloyd set up in 50 FOW a short distance away.    Well it took about 38 minutes before Dano yelled fish on!! I was getting ready to reel up and run to take pictures of his fish when I saw a BIG arch below my triangle jig pattern showing on the finder. I gave my bait a couple good 5 foot pulls and FISH ON!! and what a fight. Stripping 100 feet of line at times. Dan landed, released his fish, walked over, watched the fight for awhile, asked me for my camera, got action shots, etc.    I thought my rod was going to break. When I finally got it up by the hole it started swimming in circles and I thought for sure it was going to cut my line. But I got it up the hole and got a hold on it. Sure glad Terry cut me a 10 inch hole!    I look like I'm wasted on crack....but we were laughing pretty hard on this one. Massive head. Fish was 37"" long x 19"" girth and weighed 18.5lbs..then released very well back down the hole for someone else to enjoy. Wish I had of got a better hold on it..but what can you do after it's down the hole!?      Friday was a beautiful day. About -12C or so, sunny..but the wind came up. Sure glad I made the Clamp-it shelter on the side of my cutter. Worked GREAT to block all the wind while sitting on the sled set.    I heard Ron mumbling something from his shelter... fish on! Nice eater Whitefish that Lloyd and Ron seemed to have dialed in....taking home 6 or 7.      Friday over and we all settled in to a good supper and some TV. What else... Pete Maina muskie Videos ! Ron, Dano, Lloyd Daume (Fishhunter)    Next morning it was a balmy -31C !! Up the lake we went again and about ½ way there my ears started stinging. Guess a bit of a draft thru my old helmet. Lloyd was right on the Whities. We couldn't move him off his spot. Three days on the same spot.    Ron running the take out window from his hut. Mr. Noodles and wraps heated on his hut heater. Calls you over for you meal and hands it out the window of his Eskimo.    Dano had a BIG laker on and was in a big fight. I had time to walk over from about 400 feet away  and get a shot of him in action and a shot when the lakers head hit the ice and the hook ended up embedded in same! GONE!    I prefer Quality over quantity any day. Big bait! big fish !! Red October Muskie tube!    Lloyd still at it !      Ron with another.....this one he released.    Slow day for the rest of us and the cold took it's toll a bit early so we headed in as we were going for Chinese Food at 6pm. Our gear wrapped up ready for the next day.    Was VERY glad to see my stone work still on the wall!    That night my left ear lobe was really sore and swollen. It then started oozing clear liquid. Next thing I know many THICK layers of skin started peeling off. Frostbite had taken it's toll on it and I learned a very important lesson. Buy a new helmet! Use a hoodie or bellaclava at all times when running at 30 MPH in -31C temps! It's a real mess today.. my ear that is.  I'd arranged for Johnnyb and his ""buddy"" to join us Sunday am early (7am) and we took them up the lake to our ""spot"". His gal Jesse put on a clinic for us !        Started to snow VERY hard about noon on Sunday. Only way I knew which way was home was based on the way I was sitting on the sled seat.    It went from a blizzard to freezing rain..to rain in very short time. Jesse showed us how it was done a couple more times and we stuck it out to 3pm or so and then headed back.    Can see Terry was a boy scout leader in another life! LOL    We knew Monday was going to be a right off. That foot of snow was now about 8 inches of heavy wet slush. We had a hard time even loading the sleds on the trailer.       Loaded up, cleaned up the cottage, re-antifreezed the plumbing drains and turned the power off until we make it up again.  Want to thank everyone for making it a GREAT weekend away. Thanks to OFC we've put together some great fishing trips with the same lads over the last couple of years and it's always a GREAT time!"

Tried to figure out where were those pictures taken but I guess I need few more trips to Temagami to be able to guess it. Seems like you've got the smaller brother of the 20 Lbs. laker I got last summer ;-) I am sure it was even more fun through the ice.  Cheers, Ice Fisherman"

161868,johnnyb,2008-02-19 04:12:00,3413,"I think you covered all the bases on that report Wayne -- thanks again(!) for the hospitality -- Jessy and I can't wait to explore more of Temagami.  We actually dropped in on Jim Monday morning and he pointed us down the road to Cassels lake.  Public parking, walked out 100 meters or so, and, well, since Jessy still wanted to fish, you know the rest   She pulled up a decent trout, and all I could do was keep pace with a smallmouth bass, of all things! Anyway...glad that everyone got home safe....good luck to your daughter at the hospital.  JB"
