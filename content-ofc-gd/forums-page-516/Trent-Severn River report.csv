600644,Arcax,2011-07-08 16:56:00,5,Hello everyone - I wanted to give everyone a quick report as I found the OFC reports to be a great help for a newbie like myself.  We were fishing the Trent-Severn waterway upstream by Georgian Bay and it was a great day for me. We hauled 9 smallmouth bass over 3 hour period on July 4 (lots of action in the morning!). We had quite a bit of luck in the various little coves along the waterway (starting from Big Chute Marina and onwards).  I'm looking forward to going back and hopefully finding some pike  Good luck to all!

600696,NAW,2011-07-08 18:24:00,4022,"I was thinking about heading up that way again this summer.  But once the locks start operating, the boat trafic get is a little to much for me to handle.  Maybe I'll wait till the fall.  Thanks for the report, and welcome to OFC!"
