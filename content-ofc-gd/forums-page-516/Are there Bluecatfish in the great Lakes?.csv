600817,BillM,2011-07-09 01:10:00,17367,You sure those aren't channel cats?
600818,OutdoorDan,2011-07-09 01:12:00,325,None in the Great Lakes.
600823,coreyhkh,2011-07-09 01:21:00,163,"no the board says Blue cats, its the really big one."
600825,BillM,2011-07-09 01:22:00,17367," Cool, I thought they would have stuck to stocking local fish in that thing.  I'll have to look for that beast the next time I'm at BPS!"
600826,craigdritchie,2011-07-09 01:26:00,1586,No blue cats anywhere in Canada
