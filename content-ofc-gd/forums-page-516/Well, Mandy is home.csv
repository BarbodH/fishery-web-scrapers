She is being an absolute doll, Explored the house then curled up under the coffee table (I think she has decided that will be her safe place)beside Sue and hasn't made a peep.  Sue just told me I can fish as much as I want to, go ATVing with my son up in French River next weekend, Oh life is good!"

600762,Big Cliff,2011-07-08 23:10:00,6899, Want to co-adopt?????? I don't do much rabbit hunting any more but I'm sure she would love a good run in the bush once in a while!
600765,motv8tr,2011-07-08 23:15:00,2587,"Great to hear she is settling in so nicely....looking forward to the many pictures....heck I'm looking forward to meeting her in a couple of weeks....ahhh, who doesn't love a puppy  Maureen"
600778,aplumma,2011-07-08 23:54:00,6896,I tell yaa their is a reason they are so cute and have that puppy smell. It's so you don't throw them out for eating your shoes before you have bonded. Don't worry Cliff he will be sleeping on your side of the bed in no time.   Art
