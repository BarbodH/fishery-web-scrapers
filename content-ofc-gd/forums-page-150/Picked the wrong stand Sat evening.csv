Took it about 10 mins after sunset, he knew it was coming (Heard it come through the swamp and into the hardwoods) but it was a race between the deer showing up first or darkness....   It's funny though, he told me if it was still light out that he probably wouldn't have taken the shot as he's seen deer quite a bit bigger then this on the property. Personally, if it's got spikes I'm taking it down   What a gorgeous animal, fattest deer I've ever seen as well.  This thing was an absolute piggy!  I'll be back at it next weekend, let's hope my luck turns!  "

944063,BillM,2015-11-10 02:16:00,17367,Nice Buck. Is hunting after dark legal?  Half hour before sunrise and a half hour after sunset is legal.  We took the pic well after it was shot.
944065,Rod Caster,2015-11-10 02:32:00,5784,"oh christ that's big! Not sure I could keep my aim straight seeing that thing come towards me.  Good luck next weekend, I can't imagine a bigger one."
944079,manitoubass2,2015-11-10 04:49:00,11391,Wow! Now thats a stud!  My kiddos tried this weekend but no luck. They tracked a buck but lost it at dark. They were bummed but they got lotsa partridge and rabbits?  If you get a bigger buck then that I cant wait to see it!
