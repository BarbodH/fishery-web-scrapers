944287,fishnsled,2015-11-11 22:01:00,3520,"For those wanting some recent history, this runs tonight as selected Cineplex theatres for free.      The last two airworthy WWII Lancaster Bombers reunited over England to make history in 2014. A war relic from Canada crossed the Atlantic to meet her counterpart in the UK and for the first time in 50 years two Lancasters shared the sky for a reunion tour. The Canadian Warplane Heritage Museum Lancaster, VeRA, flew from Hamilton, Ontario to meet her British counterpart, Thumper—the only other airworthy Lancaster in the world—operated by the Royal Air Force in England. It was a mission unlike any other this Lancaster and her flight crew had ever undertaken. Two legendary bombers, separated by time and distance, met in Bomber County to fly together, this time in peace. The reunion was also a farewell tour to veterans of Bomber Command, who are so entwined in their proud history. These marvels of mechanical engineering are part of a proud lineage credited with bringing an end to WWII. First-hand accounts from those who were connected to the bomber during the war transport us back in time as they share what it was like during the Lancaster’s glory days. REUNION OF GIANTS documents this historic mission as it unfolds, through the eyes of the flight crews and veterans—all part of the bombers’ history, including this new chapter as VeRA crosses the Atlantic. Participating theatres will be announced this September with free tickets becoming available beginning October 2, 2015. For information on tickets, theatre locations and future DVD availability, please visit warplane.com."

I've never heard such silence out here. No wind, no road traffic or industrial noise, that is usually pretty prevalent out here on the peninsula. Spent a few minutes reflecting on the sacrifices of many and then the silence was broken by the sound of drums from either Midland or Penetang's cenotaph.  Shortly after that surprised by all things to hear guys sighting their guns up the road at the gun club. Of all days I find that pretty disrespectful and I'm a gun owner."

943968,DanD,2015-11-09 14:27:00,2223,"Our family is from Belgium, both my grandfathers were in the army and fought during WW1 . My Dad's father was hospitalized after a mustard gas attack; he pulled through; but the last 10 years of his life he had to ware an oxygen mask, because of the damage the gas had done to his lungs. My dad was 12 when WW2  broke out and Germany occupied Belgium. Dad told a lot of stories of what they did to survive. There were no bomb shelters in the countryside for them to go too during a bombing raid; these raids were mostly from the British/Canadians trying to push the Germans back. My Grandfather taught them  to not run when they saw the planes coming; but wait an listen; if you could here the whistle of the bomb, run to the closest ditch in the opposite direction of the noise. With my grandfather's experience with the mustard gas, he was terrified that the Germans would use it again. No such thing for a civilian to have gas-masks; so he placed pails filled with water and rags soaking in, all over the property. If they saw planes coming from the East (Germany) they would go to the closest pail and take it with them to where they would hide. Once the bombs started dropping they would breath through the water soaked rags. Dad said that yes these things were bad; but the lack of food was the worst; the Germans would confiscate anything eatable as they marched trough. So yes there are 10's of thousands of solders that died for the cause; but there were also 10's of thousands that suffered under the occupation of the German army. By 1942 my Dad (yes he was only 14 but hated the Germans) joined the underground and work with others to sabotage as may things as they could. So yes remembrance day means a lot to our family; they weren't all in the military but they fought to survive. At 11 o'clock on remembrance day; I ask my guys to stop whatever they're doing and honor the meaning of remembrance day  Dan. "
943982,manitoubass2,2015-11-09 16:25:00,11391,"Thats a horrible story but a good read.  Between my grandpa and my exs grandpa, the stories were just wicked. But grandma was from holland and her stories were unreal horrible. She prostituted to the germans for bread/potatoes. Her and others lived in an underground crapper. She was found by my grandpas best friend and recruited as sort of a spy for the west and they fed her. She didnt know how many times she was raped. My grandpas friend brought her to canada when he was disharged and married her.  He had horrible ptsd and developed a drinking problem. His wife and children moved in my grandpas basement because of his violence. He later sobered up and got help and they remained very close.  My gramps hated the war(although he lied about his age to go fight)  He told me stories of being able to see clear through germans charging as the canadians fired at them with the .303. Said the would run a clear ten feet before they realized they were dead. He couldnt remember how many he had killed? But after my grandma died he would tell me stories almost every night and it seemed like therapy to him. He was so disturbed by killing he even quit hunting. He couldnt handle to the sound of guns anymore.  My great grampa was on the other side. Full out nazi. He never talked to me about war but he defected to the US and his apt was full of nazi garb and medals etc. Pics of hitler in every room. Was a very creepy place. Im not sure of his original last name but when he came to the states he took on the name reich(pronounced reach)"
944089,pics,2015-11-10 13:23:00,1268,The history channel has some amazing programming this week leading up to November 11.. last night focused on the tunnels under Vimy Ridge.. I was reading up on the POW camps here in Canada and the 35000 German prisoners.. 6000 of them wanted to stay after the war but according to the Geneva convention had to be repatriated back to Germany.. thousands were sponsored to come back by Canadians..
944092,AKRISONER,2015-11-10 13:40:00,5558,"its pretty pathetic at work, i hear a lot of folks talk about how the younger generation is not in touch with the true meaning of remembrance day, but to be honest its always the people in their 40's at my work that continue typing away and talking when the lights go off for 2 minutes at 11.  Im not sure if its a generational thing, because when i was in school nearly the entire day was devoted to an assembly with a vet present.  Unfortunately I have to work (also agree it should be a national day of devotion) but im lucky that I get to watch the jets fly by over city hall in toronto from my desk on the 8th floor.   As some others have mentioned, there is even more to the war than the soldiers, many people were stuck doing whatever they could do to survive. my great gradnmother's sister was murdered in cold blood during the german occupation of poland in world war 1.  She was 13 years old and watched her little 8 year old sister get shot in the head...just horrific."

944215,wormdunker,2015-11-11 06:41:00,1711,Thanx for the stories folks.  Definitely an eye opener hearing of personal experiences from your family members.  My father was in WW2 as a teen.  He was an electrician stationed in Shilo Manitoba maintaining spotlights for the incoming planes.  Thank goodness he didn't have to endure the suffering you folks have written about.
944216,Woodsman,2015-11-11 07:28:00,1286,Just remember when you are at the ceremonies and enjoying a beer after that some of our service people are deployed overseas and do not have the time for much of a ceremony or a chance to have a beer.

He was wounded by shrapnel but made it through.  Moms brother was a bomber pilot and was killed along with his entire crew when their plane went down.  As  mentioned earlier in this post another uncle serving with the British Army was captured in Burma and was tortured relentlessly by the Japanese. They were beaten every day with chains and rifle butts for no reason and received one cup of rice a day for the entire time he was a prisoner.

Here is a person in a new culture, seeing things they have never seen, and when they ask a question, they are greeted with what you describe as a not nice response?  Is that what our forefather's fought for?  I think not  A few years ago I had the pleasure of working with one of the smartest people I have ever met. She was kind, caring and such an open honest person that if you took 5 minutes to speak with her you couldn't help but like her - and everyone at my company did. She was also an absolute wiz with computers and math, She was able to create solutions to problems that I knew could be done for years, but I had never mt anyone who had the ability to turn it into a solution She could do it in 3 days . I can tell you, that in 30 + years in the business world, I have NEVER seen anyone with her skills.  She was born in China. In one discussion we had, she relayed her shock at reading the events of Tienanmen Square, when the students rebelled in 1989 - because the Chinese press completely suppressed these events. IT DIDN'T happen. If you hear about it at all, it was western propaganda. Her friends who still lived in China could not be persuaded otherwise.  We think that the World Wars and their effects were universal. They weren't. The combatants were European, and to a lesser extent, much later in the game, North American. Those countries that had ties to the British Empire joined to support Britain But for many countries, this has no historical relevance.  A lot of folks here are gonna disagree with me, saying that if you come here you oughta know.  A wiseman once said something about walking a mile in someone else's shoes before judging."

943868,Spanky80,2015-11-08 18:19:00,152,"my opinion, these brave people deserve much more than 2 minutes a year to be remembered, should be a national holiday, no businesses open whatsoever.  my boss was at a gas station recently, a guy walked in carrying poppies to sell, the attendant, who was clearly of certain background, had no clue what the poppy stood for.  my boss lost it on him, saying this 'you come to this country, and you have no clue what that stands for? I will never shop here again'    As far as our store goes, we refuse service for those 2 minutes, we drop our knives, turn up the radio to hear the service playing, step back and reflect  the most powerful image you will see    Very well said FloatnFly."

943908,lew,2015-11-08 22:44:00,12766,"Paul, I've seen several of those episodes on TV and your right, it's really amazing...and terrifying...what those guys went through."
943910,OhioFisherman,2015-11-08 22:55:00,6623,"Lew, my dad was 101st airborne, it was hard to even get him to talk about it, and watching some of those programs certainly explains why.  Not just ww2 though, war is hell."
943911,lew,2015-11-08 23:00:00,12766,"Paul, my dad was Navy for 5 years during the war and most of the men in my family fought but probably the worst stories came from an uncle who was in a Japanese prison camp in Burma for a couple years.  The horror stories he told us made it hard to believe what some humans could do to others to inflict as much pain as possible."
