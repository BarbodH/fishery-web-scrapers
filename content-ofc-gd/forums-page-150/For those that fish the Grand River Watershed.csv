I know there are a lot of anglers on this site who live and fish in the waters around here and down to the Lake. This includes Whiteman's creek and its delicate trout fishery, already threatened by drought and farmer irrigation. If you live or fish in the watershed, this should be of interest to you. http://www.cela.ca/newsevents/media-release/brant-citizens-group-seeks-environmental-appeals  If you are interested and want to learn some more, just google CCOB, stop the pit.  Here's the 2 opening paragraph's Paris, Ontario - Citizens in Brant County are seeking to appeal an industrial sewage works approval and a water taking permit issued by the Ontario government that would allow a company to operate an aggregate washing operation at a gravel pit, which it received a licence for over 40 years ago but had never used until late 2014, on, or immediately adjacent to, the wellhead protection area for the Town of Paris water supply. The group, Concerned Citizens of Brant (CCOB), filed leave to appeal applications on November 13th with the Ontario Environmental Review Tribunal arguing that a provincial government decision to issue a permit to take over 10 million litres of water per day for 6 months of the year for 10 years from the groundwater system in an area that increasingly experiences drought conditions, appears unreasonable. When the decision to permit the water taking is combined with the establishment of sewage works that could concentrate herbicides from past area agricultural use in soils and sediments that will be spread one meter above the water table as part of the rehabilitation of the gravel pit, the decision of the government appears not only unreasonable but becomes a source of potentially significant environmental harm.
