944485,FLEX ROD,2015-11-13 11:31:00,394,"Hello Folks, need to replace my main line on my pin and just wanted to hear who is using what and what test pound?  I only have the one float reel so I am not in a position to change back and forth, so I am looking for what people use in the fall and winter and right into the spring.  Also really curious as to what weight main line are you running, 8 - 10 or what.  Thank you in advance,  FLEX"
944487,misfish,2015-11-13 11:47:00,29133,I run 8 pound Raven for my main line. I have been very happy with it. I like the high vis line as my peeps are not like they use to be (a lot of guys don't like it ). I run Sufix floro for my lead. 4-6 pound.
944491,porkpie,2015-11-13 12:06:00,2521,10lb trilene XL clear.  Spring fall and winter.
944494,FLEX ROD,2015-11-13 12:22:00,394,"Thanks guys, this is exactly the info I am looking for.  Thanks for including the high vis info Brian, will have to look into that but right now I am not leaning that way.  FLEX"
944497,BillM,2015-11-13 13:19:00,17367,6lb Fireline Crystal would be my choice for an all year line.
944501,blaque,2015-11-13 13:38:00,2419,"I left nanofil on right thru the winter months last season.......and it stood up ok. If it freyed up too bad it was typically the immediate line above the float and i would just eliminate that section back to good line. Call me lazy, calll me cheap.......lol, but it fishes too nicely and costs too much to peel it off"
944516,dave524,2015-11-13 14:17:00,4508,"Side casting limper works better Trilene XL or Blue Stren is good for a bit of visibility, Wallis casting I tend to like a bit stiffer line, Trilene XT , 10 lb test is good."
944518,FLEX ROD,2015-11-13 14:21:00,394,What test are you using Blaque?
944529,blaque,2015-11-13 15:44:00,2419,8 lb.......ive not tried the fireline crystal BillM referred to. But that sounds like a better option if it resists freying from iced up guides. If it floats like nanofil and stands up to the ice then im even interested in trying it next
944530,dave524,2015-11-13 16:03:00,4508,"I used 8 lb mainline back in the 80's when we fished light leader material, but since I upped my leader breaking strength I use 10 lb now as I don't like losing floats and my whole terminal set up.  Theoretically a 6/7lb leader should break before a 8 lb mainline but not always the case."
944531,FLEX ROD,2015-11-13 16:05:00,394,"Great info guys, thanks FLEX"
944533,misfish,2015-11-13 16:43:00,29133,"And to add to the high vis line Flex, I use three different colours on my reel. It makes it look sexy. Right Bill?"
944534,misfish,2015-11-13 16:48:00,29133,"Dave, I have now come use to the wallis cast and I am going to take your advise and bump up the line a bit. I find the 8 is ok,but I can see where it would work better. Thanks"
944535,DRIFTER_016,2015-11-13 17:00:00,10439,I run 12# Raven in moss green. Haven't lost a float since I changed from 8#. The line handles very well too.
944550,FLEX ROD,2015-11-13 19:16:00,394,Thanks for the feed back.  I really appriciate it.  FLEX
944587,MJL,2015-11-13 23:38:00,2427,12lb Raven for me in either green or grey/blue. Lets me bump up to 8-10lb leaders when I need to without breaking off above the float. Fishes well and it's relatively cheap.  I bought a used float reel a few weeks ago and it had a lime green mono line spooled on it (feels like 10lb). Wish I knew what it was but I like the way it fishes.
944591,misfish,2015-11-13 23:45:00,29133,You heading up mike?
