943818,Freshtrax,2015-11-08 05:46:00,2215,Fantastic.   I need to catch one someday.
943834,grizzlybri,2015-11-08 14:37:00,565,:worthy:  :clapping:  Wow great report and great pictures. This is a bucket list trip for me.
943916,Toronto_Angler,2015-11-08 23:49:00,698,Wow fantastic report! Can only dream of a trip like that. Thanks for sharing!
943941,Dusky,2015-11-09 02:44:00,310,That's amazing!!
943945,chris.brock,2015-11-09 03:14:00,4053,  Poured a drink and I read it through.  This pic says to me-  -I'm gonna be on a high for 2 weeks when I get home thinking about the Fraser River trip. -I don't care if I catch another fish. -God bless the west coast and I might just stay here and not go home at all.
943956,Moosebunk,2015-11-09 12:42:00,3970,"Two weeks is all I can afford to be at home and high off this trip Chris. Got big news soon as walking in the door here.  Next ""adventure"" begins in a couple hours.  Work!  You're right, by the time this photo was taken we didn't much care anymore.  I was rather exhausted. We'd caught our fill of fish and were steady doing so all week, only hoping for two more for the girls that day, but weren't stressing it.  West coast is cool in many ways, but so to is home here in Ontario.   Thanks again gang.  Another very BIG report to come next, before calling it a year."
943959,Steelheadphycho,2015-11-09 13:21:00,470,So flipping INCREDIBLE!!!!  The numbers on those fish were mind numbing!!  Yet another stellar report Bunk!  Can't wait for the next!
943964,blaque,2015-11-09 13:53:00,2419,"The stark realization after reading the ""lodge record"" chalkboard,  that my great lakes rods are just toys lmao........  76lb Chinook and 27lb steelhead LOLOL!!"
943965,Gallie,2015-11-09 14:25:00,1215,"That looks like a riot!, well written as always bunk! You sure know how to make a guys bucket list longer lol."
943974,bigugli,2015-11-09 14:59:00,6138,Sure looks like fun.  Guess I can dream.  Great report.
943980,manitoubass2,2015-11-09 16:10:00,11391,"How sore was everyone bunk?  I know when I get lake sturgeon(on lighter gear) its sure wears a guy out!  But the sturgeon here do get to 6 or 7 feet, but they arent half the girth of those dinosaurs thats for sure!  Sturgeon are just wicked eh? If they dont wanna move there is just nothing you can do. They dictate the battle lol  Gotta 4 footer through the ice 2 years ago and it was a total gong show to land it and a 27"" rod hahahaha  Im heading up next year for a family reunion and I cant wait!"
943986,Headhunter,2015-11-09 17:30:00,5703,"Awesome report Drew! Many thanks for taking the time to share with us! OT for a second... I have niece who has taken up residence in Prince Rupert and i have a standing invite to go there. She has many first nations friends who are outdoors man and has shown me pics of 80lb Halibut, chinnys etc... Any idea if they catch Sturgeon in the Prince Rupert area? HH"
943998,BillM,2015-11-09 19:31:00,17367,Unreal Drew!!
944009,LefroyFisherman,2015-11-09 20:32:00,602,"What an incredible trip! would love to do that some day, can't believe the number of sturgeon caught! great size also!"
944012,fishnsled,2015-11-09 20:38:00,3520,"Meh.....  Ok, what I really want to say the censorship will not allow me to post.  lol.  Just incredible Drew!!  That is a trip on my bucket list, maybe I should cross that one off sooner than later.  Thanks for taking the time to put that together, JUST EPIC!!"
944038,MJL,2015-11-10 00:19:00,2427,Amazing Drew. Last year I had the chance to fish for the sturgeon on the Fraser and I'm definitely itching to get back there again to get a bigger one. The power that those fish have is just incredible!
944071,Whopper,2015-11-10 03:09:00,2174,"Outstanding adventure Bunk. Your story telling and pictures are second to none I loved the video of the doubleheader, simply amazing.  Thanks for sharing"

They dictate the battle lol  Rick...  agree with every bit of that.  Probably the most sore and worn out of the bunch of us was myself.  Whipped going into this trip and beaten good by the fish and food ti'll the end.  Girls were commenting on their biceps the morning after their first day.  That kinda sore is the best sore ya know?  I have niece who has taken up residence in Prince Rupert and i have a standing invite to go there. She has many first nations friends who are outdoors man and has shown me pics of 80lb Halibut, chinnys etc... Any idea if they catch Sturgeon in the Prince Rupert area?  Hey Joe!  Far as I know (and I did ask the guide this as well) sturgeon in BC are really only found in the Fraser and some of it's tributaries like the Stave and Harrison.  There may be some elsewhere, but there's no known fisheries let alone sport fishing for them.  The Natives there may know different.  The Columbia would be the next closest thing but it's rather ruined because of damming and over fishing.  What Rupert will give you, you already know.  Some wicked salmon and halibut opportunities.  Last year I had the chance to fish for the sturgeon on the Fraser and I'm definitely itching to get back there again to get a bigger one.  See, you know!  You want more now. lol.  And you're not actually bitten by the sturgeon bug either, you're just very much gummed and sucked on by those giant pucker lips.  I loved the video of the doubleheader, simply amazing.  That video is funny.  Really shows how much wear and tear they put on ya.  can't believe the number of sturgeon caught! great size also!  Still in awe here too.  Was expecting a good trip but, this one really was a sturgeon slam of serious numbers and great sized fish.   And Will... I wanna hear what the censorship wouldn't allow."
944110,fishnsled,2015-11-10 16:37:00,3520, And Will... I wanna hear what the censorship wouldn't allow.  Holy darn crap Bunk!! That is just a darn awesome report!  I can't believe the size of those my mom hates me!
944112,mepps,2015-11-10 16:55:00,1301,Nicely done! I've been dreaming of doing a trip like that for years!
944113,Moosebunk,2015-11-10 17:07:00,3970,"Ha! Now that's the way we should post from here on out. Funny that is. Lol  Hope you find your way there Clive, you love your big fish for sure, and these sturg are just that. A must do of you can."
943647,Moosebunk,2015-11-06 19:41:00,3970,"B.C. BEHEMOTHS!!!  Fishing the Great White Sturgeon.    It was a misty, cool and miserably grey Sunday, June 6th, 2004.  A passenger in my friend John's 24-foot freighter canoe we were anchored where the Kwetabohagan meets the Mighty Moose. Chartreuse jig and twister tail, six pound mono spooled up on a 1000 series Sedona and fished on a shortened, tip repaired, five foot light Lightening Stick, it was there that early afternoon casting an eddy for walleyes that this first happened..."

I'm guessing those monster dinosaurs remain weirdly docile after landed, some thrashing could easily result in a swim or a broken nose???"

I'm guessing those monster dinosaurs remain weirdly docile after landed, some thrashing could easily result in a swim or a broken nose???  Forecast just a couple days going into this was rain, rain, rain, rain... and cloudy for our five days.  What we got, spit the first day in the afternoon and then wicked warm weather right through.  Perfect for enjoying the leaves that were changing, but never seemed to full change.  Fall holds on a long time there I guess.  Your guess is right too Chris.  One or two fish were a little ornery in the shallows but otherwise they are gentle giants in arms.  We hold onto their lips and tails and try to avoid the scutes on the sharper fish.  Some sturgeon are totally dulled down, others have armored razors.  Amelie's big fish on the second last day was missing a quarter of it's circular lip.  That fish was tricky to keep a hold of in the bit of current we set down into for photos.  Only sturgeon I have ever seen have difficulty releasing and, thrash too much after being caught, were lake sturgeon."

Wish'd I'd got some better jump shots... could have used Simon (Salmon) there cause he's quick on the draw.  Some halibut would be a real treat to catch, partly for the fight and fun, partly because it's the best tasting fish out there.

Please do not let me drive you nuts anymore.  Come join me.  ANYTIME!  Anywhere.  In fact, there is interest in returning to FRFL in 3 years or so.  You and Leah come along.  There's no excuse not to.  And even better yet, get Joe, Brian, Terry, Roy, T.J., Monique, Jo and whoever else is in need of some sturgeon to come along too.
