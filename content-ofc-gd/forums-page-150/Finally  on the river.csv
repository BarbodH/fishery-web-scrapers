I figured the waters would still be a little murky and opted for darker blades. Robert opted for bright and white. He guessed wrong. My half of the morning was great. In 4 hours I would land walleye, pike, smallies and sheephead. The highlight of the morning was another PB. Got myself a 30"" pickerel. Not my heaviest, but certainly my longest. She will be coming soon to a place of honor on the wall."
