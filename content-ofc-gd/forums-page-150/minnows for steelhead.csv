944338,livinisfishin,2015-11-12 02:29:00,661,I don't fish the rivers to much but I have started to fish them a  little more since I caught my first trout last year. I went on the weekend with some live minnows and I gave it a pretty good effort but couldn't get anything to bite. Nobody else was having luck around me not using minnows. Most likely will try them again soon.
944673,misfish,2015-11-14 16:53:00,29133,Way to mudded up . No report.
944676,huzzsaba,2015-11-14 17:07:00,884,Way to mudded up . No report. welcome to my world lol!  On a positive note I did catch my first largie last week from the most unexpected lake.  it was a good 3 lbs and all it took was 10 mins of fishing to land that one and a small dinky bass.  Caught on jig head and half senko.
944725,MJL,2015-11-14 19:22:00,2427,Way to mudded up . No report.  Nonsense! You just need bigger minnows
944727,misfish,2015-11-14 19:30:00,29133," Nonsense! You just need bigger minnows  Where I was Mike,it was mud. The other spot I stopped by  . High and pea. No fish. Maybe Sunday."
943704,huzzsaba,2015-11-07 03:53:00,884,"Wondering if live bait like minnows are useful for catching steelhead or do they stop feeding when they come to the river mouth and into rivers?  if live bait is worth trying, is there a certain type and size ?  Thanks"
943705,DRIFTER_016,2015-11-07 04:06:00,10439,The guys in PA use minnows all the time. Pretty weird seeing them with their little minnow bottles walking the river.
943707,Freshtrax,2015-11-07 04:14:00,2215,We use em on the niagara  over the winter and catch everything under the sun.
943718,landry,2015-11-07 05:07:00,1005,I once got schooled on the Catt by an American using minnows. He slayed them. I cAn honestly say that that is the only time a Yankee steelheader outfished me in NY.
943719,huzzsaba,2015-11-07 05:15:00,884,Thanks! I will give it a try!

943733,OhioFisherman,2015-11-07 14:59:00,6623,"In the fall here on Lake Erie vast schools of Emerald Shiners congregate along the rip rap and break walls at some of the river mouths. Those same areas seem to be where steelhead also congregate before entering the rivers.  I used to keep a steelhead a year in the fall for a dinner, when I cleaned them they were full of emerald shiners, small shad, and small perch. The lures I used to catch the steelhead, white tubes, small chrome and black crankbaits, and jigs with a white twister tail imitated  baitfish.  It stands to reason minnows should work?"
943735,solopaddler,2015-11-07 15:04:00,8605,"Yes! As Dave alluded to the use of minnows is much more common Stateside, although it's hard to understand why. Up here I've been using them for many years, mostly in pier or estuary situations. (I never walk a river with a minnow bucket).  No one does it up here.  There have been times on certain busy piers where everyone is either drifting roe or flies and I've had to be ultra secretive about what I'm using so as not to educate 100 other diehard steelheaders.  I guess the secret is out now."
943736,Dutch01,2015-11-07 15:06:00,1431,"Hey, I wanna give this a try. How do you guys fish them, on a jig?"
943737,solopaddler,2015-11-07 15:10:00,8605,"Hey, I wanna give this a try. How do you guys fish them, on a jig?  Can't speak for anyone else but always under a float lightly hooked through the back on a light wire hook. Clear water is best as a steelhead will home in on a wildly dancing minnow from a long ways away. The hits are usually pretty savage.  I've found it's often more effective to run a pretty shallow lead as well. Much more effective than drifting the minnow close to the bottom. In general about halfway to the bottom seems about right, sometimes even shallower."

Don't know why but on some rivers I fish, usually late November early December, salties sometimes outfish everything. Easy to carry around too."
943768,misfish,2015-11-07 20:26:00,29133,"I know I seen a stretch of river where minnows were jumping about  and right after,there were some big swirls and splashes. No dought they were chomping on them minnows. I have also heard of some guys    using gulp finness minnows, under their floats."

943784,huzzsaba,2015-11-07 22:54:00,884,Wow fish eat minnows?  Lol of course they will work   lol I knew that.  Wasn't sure if steelhead stop feeding like salmon since I read somewhere that they stop eating   when they are migrating up river.

Saw many fish surfacing, light brown color so I'm guessing they were brown although a few seemed to look like bass by the way they were swimming along the wall but it was hard to tell at night."

Current is strong there, 90% of the time it's a reaction bite. Many of the regulars bottom bounce there very successfully with large streamers."
