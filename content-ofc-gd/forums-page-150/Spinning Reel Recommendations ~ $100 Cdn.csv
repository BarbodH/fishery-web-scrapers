943989,dave524,2015-11-09 18:16:00,4508,"Probably a bit over a hundred now that the dollar is at 75 cents, but the Daiwa Tournament  SS1300 is one you won't wear out in a season."
943990,BillM,2015-11-09 18:18:00,17367,For $100 I'd be buying used.  Way better bang for your buck.
944010,NANUK,2015-11-09 20:35:00,797,"Gotta agree with above, The Daiwa Whisker is still my favorite spinning reel when it comes to casting, And I have reels costing more than 3 times"
944077,jtracc,2015-11-10 04:38:00,97,"One of the most solid reels I have ever owned. I have 5 stradics and a Stella (amazing reel) and the diawa ss is one my best reels. I have 2, had them since I was 14 and they the ones made in Japan. The newer ones made in Mexico or whatever are not the same but still decent."
944078,Moosebunk,2015-11-10 04:42:00,3970,"Own 5 Symetres.  1000, 2500, two 3000 and a 4000.  No probs ever with any of 'em and I'm rather hard on rods and reels.  Just asked for another 3000 for Christmas.  With that said, there's little difference in weight and size between the 2500 and the 3000.  Deeper spool is all really.  Just to get ya thinking."
943807,Dimsumi,2015-11-08 01:43:00,2,"Hi all,  Long time lurker, first time poster.  Looking to improve my gear for next year and I am hoping to purchase a spinning reel for around $100 (pre-tax)...  I mainly shore fish, targeting LMB - although I did hook into and land a muskie a few weeks back (on a wacky rigged senko of all things).  If it helps, I tend to fish a mixture of soft plastics, top water frogs, and crankbaits.  All baits/lures typically range between 0.25 to 0.75 oz.  I expect that I will mainly be using braided line on this reel.  My research to date has been focused around these three: - Pflueger President Special Edition (2016) 30X - $99.99 - Pflueger Supreme 30X - $109.99 - Shimano Symetre 2500FL - $119.99  I believe each as a gear ratio of 6.2:1 and the weights are slightly different (7.7, 7.5 and 9 oz respectively)...  Beyond that I'm not certain how to compare/evaluate the features of the different models.  Hoping that some of you can provide some additional insights or your own personal preferences.  Thanks in advance."
943809,captpierre,2015-11-08 01:50:00,2521,Symmetre gets my vote. Wait for a sale. Tough to beat the better Shimano reels
943814,Gallie,2015-11-08 04:02:00,1215,"I love pflueger, cant beat one for the price. Never had one fail on me and have brought some brute fish to the boat including giant pike and a 46"" muskie."
943817,206,2015-11-08 04:27:00,563,bought my wife a Shimano Symetre FL......I think it works smoother then most of my own reels.
943822,wormdunker,2015-11-08 10:14:00,1711,Welcome to our community.  I'm not familiar with the Pflueger nor the Symetre.n  My personal preference is the Shimano Stradic 2500 series although a bit more than your budget.
943825,sauce,2015-11-08 11:35:00,219,I have had good experiences with all shimano reels I've used. My feelings towards braid on a spinning reel is go higher end. They take the abuse braid dishes out. If I were spooling up mono or flouro a symmetre or saros would be my choice
943828,porkpie,2015-11-08 13:15:00,2521,"I did have a shimano symetre fail on me right out of the box, but I still believe them to be a good reel.  I think it was an anomaly, because I have lots of shimano reels and have kicked the crap out of them with no failures and only maintenance or replacement of maintenance parts.  Given your list, I would still pick the symetre."
943831,Sinker,2015-11-08 14:22:00,8692,"Another vote for symetre....or any other shimano. I've had issues with pfleugers. I really liked them, but they just don't hold up like my shimanos.  S."
943832,captpierre,2015-11-08 14:27:00,2521,"My only issue with both my Symmetres is the bale will flip prematurely when I cast a ripping jig vigorously. Other than that, they are as smooth as my wife's inner thigh.  ?"
943838,huzzsaba,2015-11-08 14:48:00,884,Shimano for sure.
943841,creditmaster,2015-11-08 15:01:00,190,In alll my time fishing a Shimano has never let me down
943842,crappieperchhunter,2015-11-08 15:02:00,2582,If you can find Lew's spinning reels give them a go. I have 2 now and love them both and they are inexpensive. However the only place I have seen them is Canadian Tire in Lindsay. My first one was purchased because I was up in Bobcaygeon for the week and forgot my reel at home. So I did a quick trip into Lindsay to grab something to get me through the week. $29.99 and it is a great reel for crappie/perch fishing. I use it every weekend all summer.  There $59 and $89 reels would cover a lot more fishing applications and still be at your price point.
943845,manitoubass2,2015-11-08 15:10:00,11391,Id get two okuma avengers cause you know darn well youll be using more then one rod???
943846,GBW,2015-11-08 15:10:00,8460, 
943847,GBW,2015-11-08 15:13:00,8460,The shimano sahara is a great reel sub $100 pre tax too
943852,adam lancia,2015-11-08 15:36:00,234,"I have a Sahara and a few Symetres, the only difference I've noticed is that the Symetres feel just a touch smoother when retrieving heavier lures and lures with more water resistance. Other than that. I find them to be pretty similar."
943858,Tomcat,2015-11-08 16:22:00,395,"I'm wondering why you appear to have a preference for big reels for fishing LMB. I would think that a Shimano Symetre 1000 (2 ounces lighter than a 2500) with a max drag of 7 pounds and line capacity of 110 yards with 6 pound mono or 95 yards with 10 pound Power Pro would satisfy your needs. I have experienced no difficulties landing walleye as big as 8 pounds with my Shimano Stradic 1000s. Lastly, while it may just be my own preference, I always take the rod with me that I'm buying a reel for - trying for a balanced feeling. I've never owned a Pflueger reel so I can't compare with the Shimano Symetre (I own one as well as 5 other Shimano spinning reels)."
943865,Dutch01,2015-11-08 17:52:00,1431,I just picked Daiwa Revros for $50 at Le Baron. It feels like a reel that cost twice as much. I haven't used my Abu's that DID cost twice as much since I got it. It's below your budget but worth a look.
943869,Fisherpete,2015-11-08 18:28:00,1814,He mentioned that he mainly shore fishes - the bigger reel would give him far better casting distance than a 1000 size reel.  Pete
943873,Acountdeleted,2015-11-08 18:55:00,2562,I've never had a problem with Pfluger products. The president is such a good reel. You can't go wrong with the Shimano line either. Both are good selections
943877,Sinker,2015-11-08 19:18:00,8692,"I have two that didnt make it thru a season. One the bail blew apart, the other the bearings went in. I liked them while they worked, but have a bit of a bad taste in my mouth now.  S."
943881,Gallie,2015-11-08 19:49:00,1215,"I feel your pain, i have owned many shimanos and all have failed over time and after much use. Like i mentioned ive never had a pflueger fail yet. Hopefully the price will stay low if people keep buying shimano lol. Just like buying a car theres a lemon in every bunch, ford chev dodge toyota whatever. I dont think you can go wrong with either reel personally"
943887,Dimsumi,2015-11-08 20:36:00,2,Thanks everyone for your replies to date.  Fantastic community here!!!
943967,AKRISONER,2015-11-09 14:25:00,5558,"pops has a symmetre, thing is as smooth as butter. Big fan for sure."
943975,colin519,2015-11-09 15:12:00,101,"got a Pfleuger President 6930 and Stradic FJ 1000. Pfleuger is paired with a 6'6"" medium Abu specialist from an old combo where the original reel was stolen from a bag. I landed a 10 lb walleye on it this summer on 6 lb test. certainly a capable reel for 50 bucks.  the Stradic is clearly a level above, and it was a price above. It's running on a St Croix Avid spinning UL. It's a thing of beauty. It's the most fun you can have landing bass in the 2.5lb-5lb range.  If you can afford the Shimano get it. I'd also recommend Pfleuger as a great backup reel or heavier reel that you wanna beat up a bit.  I'd have no trouble spending the money on either, but you get what you pay for. kinda of nice"
