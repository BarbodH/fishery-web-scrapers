944339,sneak_e_pete,2015-11-12 02:31:00,540,Will be redoing the boat in the spring and am wondering about flotation foam.  A lot of different opinions out there....pink board style foam from Home Depot or 2 part expanding foam.  Looking for some opinions.  I have a 14 ft Princecraft Fisherman.  Thanks in advance!!

944345,irishfield,2015-11-12 03:14:00,26272,Noodles are made with hydrogen peroxide and LDPoly. They break down in short time and absorb water. Last thing you want in the boat.
944362,Freshtrax,2015-11-12 17:27:00,2215,If anyone should know it would be you.   What would you use in a small tin boat?
944380,irishfield,2015-11-12 18:03:00,26272,"Pending cavity shapes I'd probably buy the two part pourable closed cell foam. If you have some easy shapes you could probably use blue Dow SM or pink Celfort.  You just have to be cautious as to what is closed cell, what is open and what is somewhat in between. Pool noodles work great one day and then suddenly deteriorate and become an instant sponge. Even the Dow Corning billets for floating docks start to absorb water over time and once they become waterlogged they will not dry out. I've found a few blocks floating down the lake and they weigh 4x what they should. Left in the sun they still won't dry out.  Same deal with my hot tub cover, once side is totally water logged.  If you're going to go to all the work to pull out the old, no point putting crap back in."
944381,John Bacon,2015-11-12 18:05:00,3277,Some people have mentioned using empty pop bottles.  I am not sure how long it takes for them to break down; but it may solve the issue of foam absorbing water.  Placing the bottles in there and then adding foam to fill in the spaces between may be a good idea.  You could even fill the bottles with foam before capping them.
944387,dave524,2015-11-12 18:20:00,4508,"Personally , I don't like pour in expanding foam in an aluminum boat. Nasty if you ever have to remove it for a repair, bonds to the hull so that if any water gets in the boat under the floor it won't drain to the back properly, seems to be a source of corrosion if wet and bonded to the hull, make mine cut to measure foam boards."
944398,grimsbylander,2015-11-12 18:55:00,3016,"The point of having foam is to provide an added element of safety in case that boat ever gets swamped. There's no way I'd be stuffing pool noodles or pop bottles into my boat. How about pool noodle lifejackets?Nope. Get a quality closed cell foam and install it as original factory. The placement and volume of foam is important to create level floation during times of being completely swamped. Too much in the bow for instance can push the heavy transom(motor,batteries,etc) down. Take your time and do it right."

Id love to know more about this..I have a good friend that owns Insta Insulation just outside of Brantford here.. Has any one else done this? Will it eat at the aluminum?

Will it eat at the aluminum?  Seeing how they spray it on all types of metal areas when insulating I would believe it to be fine. It's not really any different than the original foam except it is denser and closed cell. The two agents may be a little different but there is no reason to think it would harm the hull any more than the factory stuff will. In fact I would believe that the factory foam would be worse as it holds water that would over time cause corrosion at the points where it is saturated.

944443,sneak_e_pete,2015-11-13 00:43:00,540,"Nice job!!!  I assume it wasnt expanding foam...or if it was, how did you contain it from flowing over?  Also...what did you use?  Mind sharing cost and where you got it?"
944450,2 tone z71,2015-11-13 01:28:00,1311,Look up US Composites website they have it all you need the 2 lb density..they ship
