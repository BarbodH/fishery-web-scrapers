943953,Rod Caster,2015-11-09 12:16:00,5784,"Oh ya, I did a few stewing pieces as well. I'm really looking forward to some 1"" thick deer steaks!  Chris, I have a nice plot at the corner of the road that I'm looking to sever  up to 20 acres."

944164,chris.brock,2015-11-11 01:02:00,4053," Chris, I have a nice plot at the corner of the road that I'm looking to sever  up to 20 acres.    I'm worried you would be a noisy neighbor with your gunshots, chainsaws and snowmobiles"
944166,Rod Caster,2015-11-11 01:05:00,5784,"They would be only slightly louder than your gunshots, chainsaws and snowmobiles"
944167,manitoubass2,2015-11-11 01:06:00,11391,Epic???
944181,Carp,2015-11-11 01:50:00,1488,Congrats !!!
944195,chris.brock,2015-11-11 03:01:00,4053,"Epic  yeah, simple, but hilarious response, classic!"
944284,kickingfrog,2015-11-11 21:54:00,8333,Forget the chainsaws and whatnot a sleepless baby and parents would be a bigger concern.
944453,Ksword,2015-11-13 01:40:00,40,Congrats!
943467,Rod Caster,2015-11-05 14:22:00,5784,Big doe. Tagged and almost done butchering myself. Hell yea!!!

943522,davey buoy,2015-11-05 20:15:00,5505,"I'm not a hunter,but that is a big gal!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,congrats!"
943524,jimmer,2015-11-05 20:31:00,2730,Congratulation. You should get quite a few meals out of that girl.
943525,Sinker,2015-11-05 20:48:00,8692,"Nice, lets year the story of how it all went down.....shotgun? Rifle? How did it happen? Did you have her on your camera?  S."
943526,Rod Caster,2015-11-05 21:04:00,5784,"I played the wind and switched stands to the other side of my property on the second evening. I had never set up a camera here, but the stand faces a tree-heavy steep ridge with apples on top, and tracks were common in the area. Sunset was at 5pm and I used my Grandpas 303 which he had just gifted me. At 520 pm she's within earshot coming up behind me. At 525 I saw her on my far right, light was disappearing fast. I inched the riffle towards her until I could finally get a shot and took it, awkwardly, at 529. 5 seconds later she was down and dead... Perfect heart shot with no meat damage!! Another minute and I was past the legal shooting time.  We removed every square inch of meat off her... Even the meat between the ribs and up the neck. 20lbs of meat is for grinding and the remainder was steaked or made into roasts. We are a happy family!"
943527,chris.brock,2015-11-05 21:05:00,4053,"Nice Chad!  Yeah, some of the details would be interesting."
943528,Rod Caster,2015-11-05 21:06:00,5784,"Oh, and she was different from the ones caught on camera, the 'twins' are still alive as of yesterday. We are now on the hunt for bucks.  ***look up Chris ^"
943529,misfish,2015-11-05 21:15:00,29133,That'll fill the freezer.   Yup.  Nice going  And great story.  CONGRATS
943531,Beavertail,2015-11-05 22:02:00,331,"Gramp's old 303...love it. With so much emphasis these days on powerful Short Magnums, I like to see old guns/calibers still in service and taking game. Wonder what kind of stories that gun could tell?"
943540,manitoubass2,2015-11-05 23:06:00,11391,Love the 303!  Great shot!!! Whats the est. Distance?
943541,solopaddler,2015-11-05 23:20:00,8605,Way to go man!
943561,mikdor,2015-11-06 01:07:00,109,"That is beautiful big Doe for Your first deer, I assume it was on Your own property which is even  nicer. Congrats Mike"
943569,Rod Caster,2015-11-06 02:22:00,5784,It was a 20-30 yard shot. Not many long range shots available on my property.
943570,manitoubass2,2015-11-06 02:42:00,11391, Mah boy is firing the 303 tomorrow hopefully. Hes out for his first deer?
943575,Rod Caster,2015-11-06 03:26:00,5784,Good luck to your boy! Those 303 bullets are getting expensive eh?
943576,manitoubass2,2015-11-06 03:30:00,11391," And hes only 12, but hes a good shot.  Mine was grandfathered to me as well, you still have the bayonet?  Man I love that gun!  When I was around that age it felt like firing a rocket launcher lol. But mah boy handles it well.  I hope he gets his first deer, thats all hes been talking about!  If he gets skunked oh well. But i think he will get one."
