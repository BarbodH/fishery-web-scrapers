932621,kickingfrog,2015-09-04 01:12:00,8333,Not the first time I've been a day late and a dollar short.
932622,manitoubass2,2015-09-04 01:20:00,11391,You been killin it lately with the humour???
932640,fishindevil,2015-09-04 08:31:00,6254,"I think the threat from these Asian carp that they have known about for years and that shipping canal in Chicago and the slow response from both sides of the border is ""a day late & a dollar short "".     It's just a matter of time and our fisheries as we know them now won't exist .... Not good that's for sure"
932648,BillM,2015-09-04 11:35:00,17367,Nuke that entire canal.
932664,manitoubass2,2015-09-04 13:38:00,11391,Do grass carp explode in numbers like those asian carp?
932665,manitoubass2,2015-09-04 13:39:00,11391,Do grass carp explode in numbers like those asian carp?
932668,dave524,2015-09-04 14:02:00,4508,"Do grass carp explode in numbers like those asian carp?  No , that is the Silver Carp. Grass Carp eat vegetation , the ones that really screw things up are the filter feeders like the Silver and Bighead Carp that eat plankton, the same thing the fry of our gamefish eat. There have been a few grass carp caught over the last few years, think there was actually sterile ones for sale at one time for vegetation control.  edit:  http://ackenberrytroutfarms.com/grass-carp-prices-alberta.html"
932669,manitoubass2,2015-09-04 14:06:00,11391,So these grass carp arent much an issue?
932670,dave524,2015-09-04 14:11:00,4508,"So these grass carp arent much an issue?  Correct, especially if they are triploids escaped from some one's pond."
932677,John Bacon,2015-09-04 14:40:00,3277,"So these grass carp arent much an issue?  That remains to be seen.  If they are not sterile and their population grows, they may eat large amounts of vegetation and negatively affect the fisheries."
932742,leaf4,2015-09-04 21:36:00,2466,"Aside from them being invasive, they're pretty neat to look at"
935165,John Bacon,2015-09-19 04:11:00,3277,Two more grass carp have been found.  Here are some tweets from the MNR.  2 more #grasscarp caught this week in Ont. 1 in L. Erie and 1 in the Bay of Quinte. DFO and @MNRFcentral responded.Bay of Quinte #grasscarp weighed 12kg and was over a metre long. Fish was unable to reproduce. #asiancarpAnalyses not yet completed on L. Erie #grasscarp
936195,John Bacon,2015-09-24 03:11:00,3277,The Erie grass carp was sterile.  I don't recall reading whether or not the five caught in Toronto were sterile or not.  http://blogs.windsorstar.com/news/asian-carp-caught-in-lake-erie-was-sterile?hootPostID=1b6771495812989372ca3872b05e65aa

The various gov'ts need to get their crap together."

937132,jimmer,2015-09-29 14:40:00,2730,None of this should be a surprise to any of us. Mismanagement runs wild.
937148,creditmaster,2015-09-29 15:58:00,190,Nuke that entire canal. lol do it
937592,hunteronwheels,2015-10-01 16:40:00,112,i saw people zapping fish in Frenchman's bay yesterday but they wouldnt say what they were catching there was no emblem on the side of the boat so not sure if it was mnr ( no uniforms ) or someone else they were at iit for a few hours
