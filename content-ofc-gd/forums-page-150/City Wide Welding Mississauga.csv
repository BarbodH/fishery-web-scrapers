944100,JeffV,2015-11-10 14:55:00,5,I have had these fine folks do prop repair work for me on a couple of occasions.  The work has always been top notch.  I recently tried to contact them and the number is coming up as unassigned.  Anyone know what happened to them?

944121,Dan668,2015-11-10 19:04:00,1120,"Ok, well previously the one i found online didnt work. This was like 6 months ago. I did mention that to him as i had a difficult time getting a hold of him. If im not mistaken,  at that time their was just one number that came up with a quick google search"
944125,JeffV,2015-11-10 19:47:00,5,"Thanks everyone.  The 905-612-8040 number worked.  All the online listings I found pointed to the 0316 number, that one no longer works.  Good to see that they are still in business."
944127,DRIFTER_016,2015-11-10 20:10:00,10439,Good to know. I have a couple of props that need some work.

944132,DRIFTER_016,2015-11-10 20:34:00,10439,Yep. I have been dealing with them since the early 90's. Going to get them to fix a couple of dinged props and re-pitch the High5 stainless prop I got for a song this summer.
