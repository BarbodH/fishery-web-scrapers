943638,ROOK,2015-11-06 18:03:00,55,OK - so who was it in the Lund with the Honda outboard Wednesday at exactly 3pm ??? 2 guys ..one wearing white in the stern and the lucky one wearing brown in the bow who managed to cast for a musky in the shallows on the west side of Balsam south of the park ???? watched you guys from my dock ( one of the few left in the lake ) just about 200m south of your location... nice looking fish !!!My poor tinny does not have a trolling motor so I was relegated to trolling the lake Wed and Thurs since there was NO breeze what so ever but I managed nothing. Prayed for wind but alas I was just blessed with September temperatures !!!! Still better than working !!!!!!!!!!!!! My season is done but nice to see someone catch one in the shallows still ....thought they were all deep by now ???? ROOK
943639,captpierre,2015-11-06 18:08:00,2521,Beginning to think the deep theory is crap. Maybe when the water cools down.
943641,Sinker,2015-11-06 18:27:00,8692,The lakes have to turn over before they go deep.  S.
943642,landry,2015-11-06 18:48:00,1005,That warm spell pushed em shallow IMO. Was on St Clair and caught our Muskie out in the lake in 6'.
943646,jimmer,2015-11-06 19:22:00,2730,The 5 I caught on Saturday and Monday were all shallower than 8'
