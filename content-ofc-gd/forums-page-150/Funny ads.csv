791743,Christopheraaron,2013-06-10 20:00:00,3525,was just window shopping ebay and came across this guy  http://www.ebay.ca/itm/South-Bend-Micro-Lite-S-Class-4-Ultralight-Spinning-Reel-Oversized-Line-Roller-/181075068435?pt=LH_DefaultDomain_0&hash=item2a28ea4613  http://www.ebay.ca/itm/Rebel-Minnow-Lure-Silver-Black-2-1-2-Inch-F50-Minnow-Silver-Black-/160970126203?pt=LH_DefaultDomain_0&hash=item257a91337b&_uhb=1
791753,FloatnFly,2013-06-10 20:22:00,1640,"just slightly over priced on the reel.   the lure on the other hand, depending on age and packaging could be in the right ball park"
791755,Christopheraaron,2013-06-10 20:25:00,3525,"I doubt it's very old, I got a few of those for $3 each at sail the other day..."
791853,SirCranksalot,2013-06-11 01:30:00,3291,maybe the lure is pure silver??
791868,Christopheraaron,2013-06-11 02:09:00,3525,And the $14 reel too?
791884,Rod Caster,2013-06-11 02:59:00,5784,I'm headin to walmart tomorrow to stock up on SB reels!! Wal-mart is stupid to sell them below $500
791952,SirCranksalot,2013-06-11 13:38:00,3291,Sounds like a good retirement plan---snap 'em up at Walmart and sell them on E-bay at $500 a pop!
