944657,RickOnt,2015-11-14 13:56:00,669,Send the Shimanos to Peterborough.  Go to the Shimano website and print out a work order.  They will be back better than new in about 2 weeks
944683,Fisherpete,2015-11-14 17:29:00,1814,Rob I take all my Shimano reels that need service up to them in Peterborough at the end of the open water season (in a few weeks) - I'd be more than happy to bring yours up at the same time and get them back to you when we meet up again. I'm dropping one off for another board member already. Just let me know!  Pete
