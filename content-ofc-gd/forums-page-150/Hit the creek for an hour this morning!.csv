It said high winds later in the day and the showers that were happening would end around 10.  So I headed out for 10, and was pleasantly surprised to see the waters up a bit, with about two feet of visibility.  I was rewarded today!!  First I set the hook and felt a small fish on.  It fought like a little champ and I was surprised to see this gorgeous brown!!  Love the colours and markings on this one!   Let that little guy go and began drifting a nice seam along a drop off.  Float goes down again and I hook into this nice steelie!   Back to the creek it went to get bigger!  The winds began to pick up so I packed it in and headed home for lunch."
