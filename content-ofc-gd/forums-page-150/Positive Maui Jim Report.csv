Attended the office in Mississauga and they replaced both the frame and the lenses, so I have a brand new pair of glasses, no sceptical questions asked or receipt shown. I was very impressed by the service that I received from them."

944471,LostAnotherOne,2015-11-13 03:43:00,956,They are pretty sweet sunglasses aren't they.  Got mine earlier this year.  Was able to use both mine and my wives work coverage to cover most of the cost.
