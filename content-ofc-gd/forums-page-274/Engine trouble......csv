Could this be a shift linkage issue, or you think I've wrecked some gearing inside the lower unit??  Really bad time of year for me to have no engine!! My favourite time of year to be on the water!  Its a 96, 40hp mariner, longshaft, tiller. If anyone has, or knows of a lower unit for this, please let me know!!  S."
815909,Roe Bag,2013-10-31 15:36:00,246,Not sure about your particular engine but I had a similar problem with a 25 hp Johnson. Shifter linkage had slipped and reverse gear wasn't fully engaging. Hopefully the grinding you are hearing is simply because the gears aren't meshing fully. You'll often hear the same sound if you try to egage forward or reverse if the r.p.m. is a little too high. In my case it was just a matter of a minor adjustment and all was good. Good luck. kwikfish.

May be less to repair than to replace the unit asembly. It's possible as was mentioned that the shift linkage may need to be repaired too."
