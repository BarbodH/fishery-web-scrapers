815332,kickingfrog,2013-10-27 17:54:00,8333,"Last year brother whacked one (with a 20 gauge) while we were at the launch on Lac Seul, another one flushed as he walked up to get his bird and he shot the third one who just stood there. I don't care where they come from, or how you get 'em, they taste good."
815352,Rod Caster,2013-10-27 22:35:00,5784,"Glad to see you keep the thighs..some good meat on there. Have you ever tried plucking the whole bird, keeping the next, wings and all that? I'll do that sometimes...but only once did I manage to keep the skin on when plucking, it was barely worth the effort but added a nice component to the flavour."
815359,danc,2013-10-27 23:02:00,4677,Yep. Dinner on Wednesday and brunch on Saturday.       Where's the gizzard? Don't tell me that you threw it out??  I'd toss the breast before the gizzard.

I find them more thin skinned then some sports fans but if I'm going to roast them I try.    Where's the gizzard? Don't tell me that you threw it out??  I'd toss the breast before the gizzard.  Never tried them. Got a recipe? I cut the crop open to see what they've been eating but that's about it."
815387,danc,2013-10-28 02:44:00,4677,"Just throw it in the pot with the rest of bird however you are cooking it Rob. To clean the gizzard, simply slice it open on any side. It will be full of pebbles, berries, clover etc. There is a liner on the inside that simply peels away along with all of the contents. Give it a try."
815390,Sinker,2013-10-28 03:16:00,8692,"Looks great! I usually chop up the hearts and gizzards and put them in the stuffing, then roast them low and slow. Great eating birds!  S."
815810,kickingfrog,2013-10-30 22:54:00,8333,No birds for the stove today.  Did find a couple of interesting tracks.  That's a 28 gauge shell (2.75 inches).    What I believe to be a wolf track right along with the moose.    Tamaracks are more yellow now. 
815136,kickingfrog,2013-10-26 13:41:00,8333,I got out a few times this year and after a few bird less days I hit one on each of my last two outings.       A patch of tamaracks starting to turn. The photo doesn't do it justice of course.  
815140,gino,2013-10-26 14:02:00,400,great shots!
815141,lookinforwalleye,2013-10-26 14:28:00,4399,Nice little snack there for sure!!!
815146,dave524,2013-10-26 15:00:00,4508,"Nice birds, even nicer gun, an Ithaca 28, aren't they special order only? Had a 28 gauge 870 skeet grade back in the 70's 80's when I shot a lot of skeet, it was my go to gun for woodcock."
815151,kickingfrog,2013-10-26 15:13:00,8333,"It is a Ithica. I bought it used (barely) from Epps this past summer. My dad's 20 gauge featherlight was the first gun I ever shot. That 28 is the only 28 I have ever shot but I am in love with it. I liked the idea of the bottom ejector so that it can be pretty much an ambidextrous gun (my brother is opposite eyed from me). Now that I've shot it though, I'm not sure I could bare with someone else shooting it."
815166,krixxer,2013-10-26 16:40:00,274,"Nice shots, love partridge on the pan with a little Montreal spice"
815172,Rustic-Fisher,2013-10-26 17:11:00,826,"Nice shooting, I actually contemplated snagging that 28 from EPPS, Glad it found a good home. Not many of those around. R"
815184,misfish,2013-10-26 17:52:00,29133,"Dinner for one.LOL  Nice shooting Rob,and my very first shot gun was an Ithica."
815192,kickingfrog,2013-10-26 18:24:00,8333,"Nice shooting, I actually contemplated snagging that 28 from EPPS, Glad it found a good home. Not many of those around. R  I think zeroed in on the 28 when I missed out on a 20 you were selling this summerâ€¦ But I could have my guys and guns mixed up."
815203,Rod Caster,2013-10-26 19:40:00,5784,..and the season is still early!  I've been snacking on grouse quite a bit lately... those buggers are hard to hit with a .22 though.
815209,krixxer,2013-10-26 21:13:00,274,.22 is the way to go I don't like to spit shot.
815223,kickingfrog,2013-10-26 23:02:00,8333,"Only 1 pellet each in the breasts so far. I just ""candle"" the meat to double check for pellets."
815231,FloatnFly,2013-10-26 23:20:00,1640,is it weird that i see flies????
815232,dave524,2013-10-26 23:24:00,4508,".22 is the way to go I don't like to spit shot.  The Ruffed Grouse in the south are like a different species compared to the road chickens up north, flushed birds on the wing are about the toughest target there is."
815235,Rod Caster,2013-10-26 23:30:00,5784,Got one more tonight and 2 hares! Good eats.
815248,kickingfrog,2013-10-27 00:38:00,8333," The Ruffed Grouse in the south are like a different species compared to the road chickens up north, flushed birds on the wing are about the toughest target there is.  This is my first season hunting for southern birds. Before this week's birds I had flushed 6-7 without seeing them at all before they flew and only had a shot at one (I missed). It didn't help that on the days that I had to hunt I had to drop the kids at school/daycare so I wasn't on foot until 10:30-11 and it was hight teens and low twenties for temps. I remember having to shoo birds off the road up north so we could whack em. Colder temps now and things are opening up."
815249,kickingfrog,2013-10-27 00:39:00,8333,Got one more tonight and 2 hares! Good eats.  Haven't seen a bunny yet.
815255,Nipfisher,2013-10-27 01:17:00,2449,"RC, I like the .22 for birds as much as the .410. Text me and arrange a pick up date and I lend you one of my .410s and some shells for a ""test drive"". If you are seeing a lot of single birds then the .410 is the way to go. If you are finding birds flocking together, then picking them off with the .22 while not spooking the others is awesome."
815293,Rod Caster,2013-10-27 11:49:00,5784,"Sweet thanks Blair. I've done fairly well with the .22, but I've had a few birds get missed 3-4 shots in a row before they fly off. A bit frustrating, but it's very rewarding when you land a perfect head shot!"
815320,NAW,2013-10-27 16:09:00,4022,Good stuff Rob!  You cook em up yet?
815323,kickingfrog,2013-10-27 16:20:00,8333,Yep. Dinner on Wednesday and brunch on Saturday.    
815325,misfish,2013-10-27 16:32:00,29133,".22 is the way to go I don't like to spit shot.  When up north where the birds are stupid and you can shoot them in the head. Down here,they flush out faster,so the need to use a shotgun is more preferable.   Nice eats Rob."
815328,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2013-10-27 17:17:00,0,nice bush chickens... and a fine upland birding shotty!
815329,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2013-10-27 17:21:00,0,"this dude is in the north, and would prefer a shotgun over a .22 any day!"
815331,misfish,2013-10-27 17:40:00,29133,"this dude is in the north, and would prefer a shotgun over a .22 any day!  When yer driving the roads out from a moose hunt,them bush chickens can be taken with a head shot. Hell if ya miss. They dont even fly away. Stupid bird.LOL"
