Looks like this one http://lloydminster.kijiji.ca/c-cars-vehicles-boats-watercraft-other-4-hp-Mercury-2-stroke-outboard-motor-W0QQAdIdZ508924175 Somebody here might have one like it.  I'm guessing mid 80s maybe early 90s but who knows.  Alternatively, where on the motor is the stamp or sticker? Looked everywhere. Many thanks."

815886,Tim Mills,2013-10-31 13:27:00,476,Could be as new as 97. I have a 6hp with a similar cowling that has a 97 serial number.
815985,Sharkbait22,2013-10-31 22:56:00,297,Thanks for the replies.  I'll type in any number I fined.

On my '91 90hp Merc the plate is on the right bracket leg as you look @ the engine from behind the boat.  My guess is you'll find the #'s somewhere on the mounting bracket.
