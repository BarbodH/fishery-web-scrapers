816120,ch312,2013-11-01 15:38:00,1590,"the pop up tents are fine if you don't move around -- just setup and fish from the same spot all day but if you need mobility the flip up style are much better imo.  Using a popup or hub style hut doesn't really take that much longer to setup once you get the hang of it.  For 3 winters I used a Clam 2000 suitcase style hut and was fairly happy with it and it was easy tp pull by hand, but I really didn't like how I needed to load and unloaded everything from on top of the hut as the hut acts as your sled when it's collapsed.  I then sold that and used a Clam Yukon TC for a few winters and was very happy with it. But, I don't have a garage and that hut is large and heavy which was a slight pain as carrying it into the basement to dry out after each trip wasn't fun. Due to it's size it also meant I had no option but to tow the trailer every time I went fishing as a hut that size definitely needed the ATV to get around.  I'm now using a Clam tamarack hub style and am very happy with it as it's light and quick to setup while providing more space than the Yukon and is much more portable as all of my gear fits in a 5' sled that I pull by hand. I keep all of my gear in the sled and simply setup the hut over my sled so all of my gear doesn't need to be loaded/unloaded for every move and it stays in the hut with me staying warm and dry. It's also much nicer using this hut with the ATV as everything fits on the machine meaning I'm not forced to tow a trailer every outing which saves a nice chunk of change every winter.  It takes maybe 30 seconds longer to setup the hub style over the flip style. With the flip you need to extend the poles inside and flip it over you while for the hub you pop out the sides and you're good to go.   Clam has very good customer service and it is that couple with quality products which makes me stick with them. A few years back a sharp piece of plastic on the Clam 2000 caused a 2-3"" tear in the tarp. I emailed them with the expectation of getting a free patch kit or maybe a discounted tarp. A couple weeks later the delivery man showed up with a brand new replacement hut free of charge!"
815663,redpearl99,2013-10-30 02:56:00,259,"Im looking to get an ice shelter for this year.  I dont have a snowmobile or tow vehicle so it has to be a shelter i can pull.  Im looking to get a one man flip up shelter but dont really know which one is the most practical to pull with a rope.  I would ideally like a pull-able flip up shelter that has a sled with enough storage room to fit my auger, rods and tip ups"
815666,porkpie,2013-10-30 03:02:00,2521,"Having owned  all varieties over the years, I would have to say the most useful to me is the hub style.  I still have a 2 man fish trap, but I never use it.  I just toss a 2 man hub style shelter on the rack of my ATV, or in the toboggan if I'm on foot, and i am good to go.  Only takes me a few minutes to set and secure if i find a hot bite, and I can break it down really quickly.  Often times I don't want to fish from a shelter if the weather is decent, so this works for me.  If your set on the tub style with a flip over shelter, i have always had pretty good value from the fish trap line!  Your mileage may vary!"
815667,DRIFTER_016,2013-10-30 03:03:00,10439,I like my Frabil. Either the Recon or Commando will fit your needs.  If you are on foot you would do well to build a Smitty Sled to haul you sled on as they glide through deep snow much better than theplastic sleds that come with these flip overs come with.  Lots of info on Smitty sleds on the web. https://www.google.ca/#q=smitty+sled

I have a pop up as well but it only see's uses during early ice when I'm walking out to my fishing spot. My 2 man flip over gets put into service as soon as the ice is safe for snowmobile travel. I find it much faster and easier to switch spots than having to take my hub down and load it into the toboggan and reverse the process at the next spot.  My flip over stays connected to my snowmobile and if it's nice I don't have to do anything but sit and fish as my seats are built in and I don't need to put the top up."
815676,redpearl99,2013-10-30 03:41:00,259,"I don't have a snowmobile, so any recommended shelter would have to be light enough to be pulled via human strength"
815678,2 tone z71,2013-10-30 03:42:00,1311,Ive  got a Dave Genz Fish trap for sale on here..very light portable and easy to set up..10 inch gas auger too
815708,jeffw,2013-10-30 11:33:00,267,I love my frabill recon dlx. It weighs under 50 lbs and is pretty easy to pull even in deep snow. Usually retails for around $250 brand new. Cheers jeff
815712,buick14,2013-10-30 12:23:00,741,"i enjoyed my 2man (pop up not flipover) clam 2000, it was very light and the price was good....it was pretty darn light to pull bby hand.  Im pulling a clam nanook now, little heavier, but I enjoy it.......wish I had info on a 1 man for yuh, but as jeff stated I heard great things about the frabil recon and the genz units"
815740,mike rousseau,2013-10-30 15:06:00,4661,"I have a Clam fish trap pro... Love it...  It's more of a 1.5 man hut...  I can fit everything I need in it...  Minnow Pail... Buddy heater... Sonar... 5 gallon pail... Tackle box... Rod caddy... Auger...  And has a built in swivel seat...  And has a zipper door so you don't have to ""break the seal""  of snow around the hut on a cold windy day....  I'm 6'4"" and I have plenty of room...  I've even squeezed a second person in on nasty days... It's tight... And your snuggling pretty close... But I've done it..."
815744,BillM,2013-10-30 15:19:00,17367,Those single man Clams are pretty awesome.  Although do yourself a favour and spend the extra $$$ on the thermal unit.  I've got a Nanook thermal and it gets balmy in there even without a heater.
815752,bare foot wader,2013-10-30 17:53:00,1354,"how big are the lakes you fish regularly? how far are you hand pulling?  I have a 2 man otter flip over, insulated, 90 lbs plus auger and gear, you can hand pull it but hit some deep or slushy spots and you feel it  use a long rope to hand pull, makes it easier on you, I use one of my 20' tow straps  If I was strictly hand pulling, I'd get a light weight sled (not the heavy otter magnums lol) and a pop up tent.....I was looking at the new eskimo and clam insulated pop ups, they look pretty nice"

The sled part is actually the same sled as the fish trap...the top is just mounted sideways onto the sled part compared to the Fish Trap. This layout is 100 times better then any one man flip IMHO because you have room beside you for stuff rather then always having to reach behind you for gear/food etc."

815852,redpearl99,2013-10-31 02:13:00,259,"thank you for the advise so far.  I dont plan on hand pulling to far, I normally just ice fish smaller kettle lakes"
815854,wallyboss,2013-10-31 02:31:00,1095,If you get a Clam Fishtrap and you are going to pull it by hand do not make the error of putting  runners under it because on wet snow the snow just packs them up and the sleds feels like it weighs 300lbs.
815937,misfish,2013-10-31 19:36:00,29133,"I will be buying an Eskimo pop tent this year. Light and easy to carry. Like a back pack. Drag a small kids sled with the days supplies. Walking out this year with a 2pc Ice Armore suit should be real nice,compared to the one pc."
815964,Burtess,2013-10-31 21:06:00,901,"I had read that the Clam's weren't that easy to put due to the design of the sled, many say that they plow the snow (someone already suggested a ""Smitty Sled"").  Do you have a truck or van to put it in?  I needed one to fit in the trunk/back seat of my Chevy Cruze so I picked up a Eskimo Quick Flip 1 at LeBaron last week (no tax sale!).  Looks to be built pretty well..... I like the method of securing the poles - they are not screwed to plate on only one side like the Clam's - they fit between two plates of steel and are bolted through.  At about 45lbs its fairly light and the sled has a nice ramp to it so it should pull ok I think.  Most important, it fits in the car (Clam Kenai would not).  I did a bit of research on the one man flips, I travel to the US frequently thus the US stores:     Burt"
