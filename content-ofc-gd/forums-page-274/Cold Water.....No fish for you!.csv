Not a single Fish caught which was disappointing, but had fun up Nord for the day. Sucked about 1:00am when my alty but the bullet. Thank god it wasn't on the fire road. Just some pics if the last 48. Btw never seen the lock fully drained before. Pretty neat. Talked to a guy working there and he said it was something like 120 sms (square meters per second) lots of water anyways.   Drained lock.   Becky at the lock adjusting her gear  Bottom of the lock  Just a few random pics fishin. Sorry no fish to report  Night ended this way. Alternator shot. Ok. Had a spare in the garage. Thankfully not on the FR.  "
815369,Joeytier,2013-10-27 23:50:00,3990,Ohhhh that bites.  A CAA membership is worth its weight in gold.  At least you got out!
815370,Musky or Specks,2013-10-28 00:01:00,2710,Ohhhh that bites. A CAA membership is worth its weight in gold. At least you got out! Yup even came on got me In Labrador when I tore my starter wire off my truck
815386,NAW,2013-10-28 02:22:00,4022,That's a fun ride in to swift rapids.  Kind of makes you feel like your in the north.   Saw two moose last time I was up there.
815395,pidge,2013-10-28 05:30:00,438,"Yeah Joey thought about that today. I was keeping my eyes open Nick for moose, but all we seen was a fox on the way out."
815405,SirCranksalot,2013-10-28 12:19:00,3291,Are you guys referring to the 'road' from the South? Can you do that with anything less than a 4 x 4?
815412,pidge,2013-10-28 13:56:00,438,Don't need a 4x4 but I wouldn't take a civic through there although I've seen it . There's some soft spots from new gravel and a little civic type car could run into a bit of trouble. Something with some decent ground clearance is preferred. There's also a few spots where a car would likely bottom out.
815415,NAW,2013-10-28 14:14:00,4022,"I've only been in once.  And it was the road in from the south.  It was in the spring, and there was still a foot of snow/ice on the road.  Just two tire tracks to follow. Ford Ranger.  Bottomed out a few times.  But nothing to scary.  I'd avoid in with most cars.  I think they used to run a rally on that road a long time ago."
815418,pidge,2013-10-28 14:52:00,438,I think your right about the rally NAW. My father has told me the same thing. As far as roads go I was speaking to a Orilla Power Worker up there on Saturday and he told me that's the only way in really. There is some road from the north but it ends apparently.
