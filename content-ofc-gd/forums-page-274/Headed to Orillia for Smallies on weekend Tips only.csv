Baitfish will probably make up a good portion of their diet now, use lures that mimic baitfish.  White tubes worked fairly well down here this time of year, there were millions of emerald shiners balled up and the smallies and other gamefish would follow them. Dropshotting  also will work, and down here a slow trolled crankbait works into November, usually needed to troll them to get the down deep and locate fish."
