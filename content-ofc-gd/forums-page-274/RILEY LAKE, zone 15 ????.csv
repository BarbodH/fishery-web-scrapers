As well, checked MNR 'fish on-line' but based on erroneous data of our current & previous home lakes, I don't have a lot of faith in their data accuracy. Would like to confirm primary species (particularly pike LOL) & abundance (poor, fair, good etc). PM's are more than welcome & any input greatly appreciated.  Cheers, Slayer"

815433,Loadman,2013-10-28 18:50:00,63,the pike in there are not a lot to say the least... the sizes are on the smaller side.... it is a small lake and it does get fished a lot but give er  a try... you may hit a giant! there are better options tho in the area for larger #s and size pike.
815443,Pikeslayer,2013-10-28 19:41:00,1443," Thx for the feedback & PM's gents. I did some quick Internet research on water quality & found the following. At the end of the day, not great water quality/fish habitat.   http://www.muskokawaterweb.ca/images/lds/LakeDataSheetInfo.pdf  http://www.muskokawaterweb.ca/images/lds/Riley.pdf  http://muskokarealestateservices.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Riley_Lake.pdf  http://agrienvarchive.ca/download/Riley_lake_biolsurv68.pdf"
