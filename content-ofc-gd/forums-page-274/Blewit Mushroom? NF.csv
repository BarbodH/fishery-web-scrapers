812660,spinnerdoc,2013-10-13 19:58:00,556,I have been always curious about shrooming but been chicken to try it out. My sister and her kids  when I was little picked a poisonous one had to be rushed to the hospital.  I have only gone for fiddle heads and  water crest...both tasty might I say. Thanks for posting bud. Very informative.
812752,Rod Caster,2013-10-14 11:08:00,5784,"Hey EHG and Bluegill, I've been reading up on both the Honey and Blueing Bolete, and it seems that some of the credible reference guides i.e. Pedersen's, classify them as ""Not Recommended"" for eating. They further mention that the Honey has been historically known as making people ill, but more recently people have been eating them, with only a small percentage of people having ill-reactions. The other thing they mention about the honey, is that there are other Similar species, making it hard to identify, thereby ""Not Recommending"" them.  Essentially the same story applies to the Blueing Bolete, including the beginners Bolete Rule ""you can safely eat any bolete EXCEPT ones that turn blue when bruised and/or have a red or orange pore surface."".... although it's mostly recognized that gyroporus Cyanescens is excluded from this rule.  I'm thinking that these field guide books are quite conservative, worried about litigation and aimed at beginners, so if there area any concerns of mis-identification or illness, that they label it as ""Not Recommended"". I've seen other species otherwise edible, that are labelled ""not recommended"". What do you think?"

812785,Rod Caster,2013-10-14 14:59:00,5784,"Excellent. As always, appreciate your input. I'm very interested in George Barron's field guide...it seems more local-specific.  Here are some other Honey's I found today.  "
812800,ehg,2013-10-14 16:06:00,2666,"Really got into mushroom identification 15=20 yrs. ago.  Found the best eating mushrooms were in order- !. By far Black Morels- they are around when fiddleheads are best. Best dinner ever was Morels, fiddleheads, with fresh caught crappie in spring. 2 Lobster mushroom- easily identified  and surprisingly great-read up on them. 3 Chantrelles and Black trumpets. 4.King Boletes- have to find buttons or they get lots of bug/larvae 5. Blewits- Latest in season usually bug free.    Despite there being hundreds of different types of mushrooms (enjoyed just identifying them) my list of edibles i would keep was short. Honey mushrooms i would skip over for different reasons.  I would highly recommend next summer chantrelles (especially black trumpets). Need to find deciduous hardwoods., Once you gain knowledge and experience finding buttons of fairly new king boletes or even meadow, horse mushrooms is good before the bugs get them. You seem to be cautious which you need.  There are others even, found 'sweet tooth' a few times they were great."
812863,Rod Caster,2013-10-14 23:15:00,5784,I cut my teeth foraging for chantrelles this year... I have about 10lbs dried. So far they are my favorites along with Oysters.... and they are all over my property! I even used the chantrells in my turkey stuffing yesterday
813534,ch312,2013-10-18 17:55:00,1590,Puff balls are still going strong around here as this one was very bright white and very firm. Best get out there before the frost hits and ruins them

814018,Bernie,2013-10-20 20:00:00,3190,Just took a quick trip with the camera around the cottage. Found these. Some don't look too good. One looked like it may be OK. But I'd never try it without knowing for sure.  These were the first ones that don't look right. Especially underneath.    This one looked like it may be possible.    Not sure if this one is an earlier version of the previous one.   Any thoughts?

The only ones I'm seeing are the Golden Corals and a few Honey's. The Chantrelles are past their prime as well.  Bernie, Those top ones look like a 'Bolete' type mushrooms, I'd say Goldstalk based on those two photos ....  Boletes have an underside that looks like foam."

Apparently Blewits vary in color; these ones are light pink and have all the other visual/anatomical cues. There doesn't seem to be any ""false blewits"" that very-closely resemble a true Blewit.  Any thoughts?       These are Golden Coral mushrooms, not recommended for eating (but not poisonous). These guys look really cool!

811900,Dozer,2013-10-09 20:17:00,896,"Big time shroomer here.  The first unidentified ones are honey mushrooms, fantastic eating, look around that area because they can grow by the hundreds.  This is the time for them.  A little field tip for checking whether or not a mushroom is edible is to compress the underside of the cap on your tongue, if it stings its not edible.  NEVER rely on this method though and always reference a book or website, especially when you're just starting out.  There is a shroom here in Canada that closely resembles a bolete and can really mess you up.  Morels and Lobsters are my favorite but I love them all, boletes make a great sauce and dried they are a great additive to any meal.  Happy shrooming"

Google 'blewit burrito' and watch the video, I did this tonight so I can grow them from leaf litter and mulch."
