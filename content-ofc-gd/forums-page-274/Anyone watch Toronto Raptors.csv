815521,dave524,2013-10-29 12:48:00,4508,"My wife would like to start watching some basketball, really only interested in the Raptors. Can't seem to find any low cost options. Anyone ??"
815525,cram,2013-10-29 13:08:00,1733,"Scalpers.  Should be tickets below cost for many (perhaps most) games.  There's a scalper in town who specializes in raptors tickets -- forget his name, but a google search could help."
815527,dave524,2013-10-29 13:10:00,4508,Oops failed to say we were interested in watching on TV or maybe online.
815528,cram,2013-10-29 13:15:00,1733,Most games will be on regular cable.
815529,dave524,2013-10-29 13:24:00,4508,we have satellite........ Bell
815531,dave524,2013-10-29 13:35:00,4508,"She is finding a few now on TSN and SNet, guess no one carried any of the preseason games, but it looks like she'll be able to catch the regular season without an expensive NBA package. She is American, I told her no one watches basketball in Canada"
815532,ratherboutdoors,2013-10-29 13:36:00,132,"The reqular season starts wednesday Oct 30 on TSN2. Bell carries most games on either TSN or Sportsnet.  Simmilar to the Leafs, some are aired on NBA TV.  See link... http://www.nba.com/schedules/national_tv_schedule/canada/"
815533,dave524,2013-10-29 13:40:00,4508,"The reqular season starts wednesday Oct 30 on TSN2. Bell carries most games on either TSN or Sportsnet.  Simmilar to the Leafs, some are aired on NBA TV.  See link... http://www.nba.com/schedules/national_tv_schedule/canada/ Thanks for the link I think she should be good now. The preseason not being broadcast had her worried the regular games would not be shown."
815547,Beans,2013-10-29 16:03:00,3339,"As soon as Boston finishes off the Cardinals in the World Seriousness, I'll be watching the Raptors...  Some of the shots are awesome !!!"
815550,Musky or Specks,2013-10-29 16:09:00,2710,NBA LEAGUE PASS IS CURRENTLY FREE
815551,cram,2013-10-29 16:12:00,1733,Bell owns the raptors so you'll get most games.
815552,cram,2013-10-29 16:12:00,1733,btw - college ball is better. Especially this year.
815581,scugpg,2013-10-29 19:47:00,1373,can you order nba tv canada as a separate channel?. tons of raptors shows and games on there.
815600,Rizzo,2013-10-29 21:56:00,4754,I caught almost all the games last year with Bell satellite. I dont have Raptors tv so basically only missed the games they aired
815602,Steve,2013-10-29 22:06:00,2075,bring her down to the games ... tickets are virtually free.  our company has a box that barely is even opened for the raptors...can't get employee's to go - even for free.
815668,dave524,2013-10-30 03:08:00,4508,"Thanks all, seems they are mostly aired, we searched for the preseason games and couldn't find any, regular season seems to be OK."
