815628,skinny,2013-10-30 00:10:00,442,my new boat has a top and side curtians but some of this stuff has lived folded in boxes and or up in same position for years what works good for softening this stuff up to make usable again 
815846,Canuck,2013-10-31 01:10:00,491,I have used the Starbrite brand waterproofing and I find it does soften up sunbrella fabric type of tops.  If your tops have vinyl backing and have dried out I dont think there is much you can do to soften them.
815847,DRIFTER_016,2013-10-31 01:24:00,10439,You can try filling your bath tub with hot water and giving them a soak for an hour or so so help remove the creases. Lay them out flat when you remove them from soaking. May even put a piece of plywood on top to help press them.  I have an 8 year old bath mat that I have not been able to get rid of the kink where it hung over the hanger at the store so who knows if it will work or not.
815848,Bernie,2013-10-31 01:30:00,3190,I have found that installing the top on the boat and letting it sit in a hot sun for a couple hours does the trick. But it's going to be a while before you can try that
