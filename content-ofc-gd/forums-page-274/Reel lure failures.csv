815515,steelhedrmatt,2013-10-29 10:57:00,278," Salmon gear isn't very complicated.  Probably why the Daiwa Sealines haven't changed much since the early 80's.    I run a pair of Okuma Convectors on my dipsy setups as well, no complaints..   However, I don't beat on them I do my other fishing gear. True on the Diawa's..I have a pair of diawa charter specials i've had for over 15 years. They've since been retired as laker rods for trolling Simcoe, but still going strong with very little maintenance. I don't tend to beat on my gear like most do....I let the fish do that!!LOL  Nothing like a wire dipsey hit with a 30 lb'er on the end....Thats punishment!"
815516,fishindevil,2013-10-29 11:31:00,6254,"Almost all of my salmon trolling gear including wire dipsey rods and reels are Okuma.  Going close to 10 years strong without a failure. That being said, I have no experience with their spinning gear. If they can make their trolling gear stand up to the punishment of Lake Ontario salmon fishing, I'm surprized they dont put that same quality into their other gear.  I guess I'll stick to shimano for spinning stuff. same here dead on the money !!!!"

I've got a set of Sealines that I remember using as a young kid with the oldman (Pair of 27H's and 47Hs) they still are attached to my primary rigger rods (Which are old Fenwick custom fibreglass rods!)   I wouldn't trade them for anything."
815614,danc,2013-10-29 22:47:00,4677, (Which are old Fenwick custom fibreglass rods!)  I just rediscovered an old 9' Fenwick fibreglass fly rod in the basement Bill. It was my pride and joy back in the day. I'm sure that I have a 7' Fenwick spinning rod down there somewhere as well. Probably with a Mitchell 300 attached to it. Thanks for the memories.
815618,buick14,2013-10-29 23:15:00,741,"Every company has their strengths, and quite possible their strengths are in their (okuma) heavier duty stuff.   You like their heavier duty stuff so much, you buy their bass gear.  one model fails, you move on to the next, which (hopefully) holds up.  Then you're content or happy, or you move on. Daiwa lowest end I HATE.  if i started with low end daiwa and had the failures i had, id verbally blast the company.  As i stand now, midrange daiwa....I'd choose shimano.....high end? Very large toss up with daiwa shimano.  Abu? I'm model specific.  Pfluegar, never tried long enough....just like lews....never had enough time.  Quantum?.......guys, I'm sorry, they (most) are built VERY well, overbuilt in many cases, yet the ones I've used have only been as strong as their weakest link....which SUCKS!.....again no offence here, but there are reasons anglers become ""brand specific"".   I started okuma ""high end bass"" and they fell wayyyyy short.....but that's JUST my experience.  But they were all new to the market gear....  I guess also that a sour taste can be put into ppls mouth by purchasing new to the market products and/or the lemon model of the bunch.  Just like buying the first model year of a vehicle........  Oh and btw, rod companies annoy me the most....I cant pick a specific brand .  They are all great and suck at the same time."
815630,moemoe,2013-10-30 00:21:00,352,"I agree that the lower price daiwas are just as bad as the okuma brands in comparing trolling reels such as the accudepths to the magdas....I think the sealines are the nicest reels for the money, just never liked there handle which they have now upgraded.......that being said I bought a okuma trio 30, 3 years ago after some positive reviews and it has been an excellent spinning reel.....My buddy purchased the isis 400 for skis and has been happy with that as well.......I have had magdas, convectors and clarions and wouldnt buy another...cant wait to see the sealines in the 500 and 600 size for copper lines"

I'm sure that I have a 7' Fenwick spinning rod down there somewhere as well. Probably with a Mitchell 300 attached to it. Thanks for the memories.  I gotta get two of my oldmans re-wrapped, but I tell ya there isn't anything else I'd rather reel a big king or laker in with.  They are a lot of fun.  Also have a old Mitchel 782 Mooching reel that gets used quite a bit as well."
815129,ubfishin,2013-10-26 13:28:00,15,Hey fellow anglers I'm new on here i'm a non-boater who loves to fish for the bass. I build cars all day so hunting for a lunker from shore is my therapy. Just wanted to share with you a couple of heads ups on some product failures that I have experienced this past season.  1. BPS Carbonlite blew out the transmission on probably what was my heaviest bucketmouth to date in the pads. Set the hook reeled like a mad man and then POW!!!! handle is turning but the spool's not. Tried to catch up with it by hand bombing......too late she was gone So off to BPS I go to return both cuz of coarse I bought 2 of them.....should have never strayed away from my shimano  2.Strike King crankbaits series 4 and 4s leakers and non tunable right out of the pkg. I have 7 so far and still half dozen or so still in the pkg. Don't get me wrong these baits produce but seem the quality is suffering. Tried to take them back to the store no replacements offered. I was told to contact Strike King wich I have with no replies. Maybe I should drop KVD a line since his name is all over that product.  well enough for now 
815133,ubfishin,2013-10-26 13:31:00,15,Oh and I need help on adding pics to this
815138,ubfishin,2013-10-26 13:47:00,15,
815139,ubfishin,2013-10-26 13:48:00,15,I think I sorta figured this out
815145,lookinforwalleye,2013-10-26 14:49:00,4399,I have a couple BPS branded reels... a johnny morris which is a fabulous reel for the money and a cheaper one and no complaints but can`t argue the Shimano comment.
815153,Steve,2013-10-26 15:30:00,2075,"I ""believe"" bps reels are made by okuma.  okuma reels are ""generally"" junk (90% - maybe 95% of them).  live and learn.  oh, nice bass!"
815161,Raf,2013-10-26 16:25:00,3495,"nice bass  warrantys are great and all but they are of little consolation if and when you lose your personal best or are 3 hours from home on a fishing trip when the equipment failure occurs.  that's why i'd rather go with one of the bigger names and higher priced models, abu, shimano, daiwa.. not that they don't fail but it seems people have far less issue with them."
815183,aplumma,2013-10-26 17:50:00,6896,Welcome to the board you should have a great time here.   Art
815185,misfish,2013-10-26 17:57:00,29133,"  I was told they were made by Shimano.  I have had no issues with my BPS reels. Just the crap Browning ones.  Yes.nice bass,and welcome."
815189,Steve,2013-10-26 18:14:00,2075,"Here's the answer ""who makes bps reels"" right from the horses mouth (horrible grammar): .:  Bass Pro reels are made by a Company named OEM Manufacturing that outsources its production to many different companies . In the cases of contracted fishing reels for other companies they are now being made in either China or Korea . OEM manufactures anywhere from 30-75% of the worlds reels in a given year . The similarities to other reel companies are the reason for the incorrect answers to this question . When OEM is in manufacturing mode of particular reels the many different companies using OEM will have their reels run afterwards with similarities to save money by not making OEM to retool all of their machinery to produce them . Bass Pro uses this money saving tactic better than all the other reel companies out their . They then pass some of the savings off to us. Thats why Bass Pro can sell very similar looking reels to others with as good or better insides to others for lower prices . OEM manufactures reels for Shakespear ( who owns Pflueger and gets some royalties for Bass Pro exclusive Pflueger reels ) , Bass Pro , some of Cabelas , Browning ( who is being sold thru Bass Pro for royalties) , Pinnacle , Southbend , and who knows how many others and how many parts they make for other manufactures who do most of their own production . The thing about these similar reels they are all done by the specs of the different reel companies . Those specs are better in some than in others . Bass Pro gets high end bearings and manufacturing tolerances for even less than others do for a lesser model because of their volume is so much higher than others . Again they do pass some these savings on to us . And for my money I can't help myself from grabbing up some that savings from time to time . Hope that helps you out in some way .

815246,ubfishin,2013-10-27 00:15:00,15,maybe that 10 lber is lurking out there somewhere....ahahah
815247,ubfishin,2013-10-27 00:24:00,15,Came home with the Abu Revo STX 7.1:1........Had the Chronarch in hand but just didn't feel right. I guess only time will tell if swaying away from Shimano will bite me again Thanxs for the info on the BPS reels origins
815259,manitoubass2,2013-10-27 01:40:00,11391,"Flicker shads in current suck b**** imo. Whoever said okuma reels suck i strongly disagree. At least for spinning, my avenger 25a's are friggen awesome! And very inexpensive. Never tried any of there baitcasters though"
815268,lookinforwalleye,2013-10-27 02:03:00,4399,I have a Revo not a bad reel at all you should be happy with it.
815278,kemper,2013-10-27 03:16:00,2232,Everything I have ever purchased from Okuma has self-destructed almost immediately.  Never again.
815287,fishindevil,2013-10-27 07:33:00,6254,I have had a Johnny Morris baitcast reel and I got it the first year bass pro in Toronto opened and I have put hundreds of hours on it and has been in my bass arsenal since and had been awesome till about 3 weeks ago when the reel basically started to release on its own and had trouble engaging the spool !!!!! So I guess I got a good one as its been flawless till now !!! Yes it's a lot heavier than my curados. And my chronarchs but it's done the job for years and all I have ever done is oil it and clean it and that's all !!!! Would I buy another one  no I would not as it's not as light as my other ones but it sure doesn't owe me any money and I really think it's a simple fix and will attempt to get it fixed over the winter and if so I will use it as a secondary reel from now on and replace it with another shimano of course !!!!! Tight-lines
815299,buick14,2013-10-27 12:35:00,741,"Agreed.  The rods gave me a sour taste as well starting with the carbon c3......inferior rods and reels IMO, not to say quality can't change, maybe things are diff now, but I'm not going there anytime soon.  That's also too bad about the carbon lite, some ppl really like its performance, glad I didn't pop out to buy a few. Did u take it apart?"
815304,ChasinTails,2013-10-27 13:28:00,90,"nice fish. my bps bionic has caught me everything, bass, eyes, trout, salmon, pike etc etc and it was all of 40 bucks"

815402,Live2fish85,2013-10-28 12:05:00,1633,I see this all the time at work. Most likely it wasn't anything wrong with the reel. Just that there wasn't any mono put on the reel before the braid.
815419,manitoubass2,2013-10-28 15:25:00,11391,Everyone has experiences im sure. But my avenger spinning reels are absolutely my favorite. And you cant go wrong wit the price
815461,Steve,2013-10-28 22:04:00,2075,"and with Okuma you get what you pay for.  you pay sub average price, you get sub average quality.  when i worked at the tackle shop and saw folks looking closely at an okuma, i simply pointed to the closest daiwa.  that reins true whether talking an open face trolling reel or spinning reel.  low end or mid end, daiwa > okuma in every instance."
