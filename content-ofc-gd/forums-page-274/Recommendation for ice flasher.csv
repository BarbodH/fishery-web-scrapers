814835,BillM,2013-10-24 21:10:00,17367,"While on the topic, anybody know if i can set up my HB 898Hd si/di to work with an ice ducer? Its a new unit for me and im not very familiar with the new technology compatibilities. I wouldnt mind having a second unit to try as i've never used a graph to ice fish.  That's not a very portable unit (I've got the same one) I don't think it would be very good out on the ice.   That 747c you see in my pic does double duty for me.   In the boat it's attached to the US2 on my Terrova on the bow, in the winter it goes into the portable pack for me to use on the ice.   You can pick up that unit pretty cheap."
814842,Angler management,2013-10-24 21:26:00,280,"Ya its not very portable thats for sure, i have been looking for a similar unit you have and havent come across anything yet. I was just looking for a cheap way to get a second unit to use on ice, but wouldnt be very cheap if the 898 was to get damaged... Im just going to keep my eyes peeled for a cheap unit for spare!"
814855,BillM,2013-10-24 22:09:00,17367,"Yeah, they aren't exactly cheap to replace!"
814890,Moosebunk,2013-10-25 00:04:00,3970,"Buddy of mine bought me an X67 in 2009 as a gift.  Haven't had any reason to change from that.  I'll flip back and forth between graph and flasher depending on mood.  It's lightweight... smaller.  Half the price of a Vex or Marcum.  Has never frozen up.  Runs sometimes 2-3 days on a full charge.  Only thing I sometimes find is at the end of a long days fishing, that that little screen makes me bug-eyed.  I do like the flasher units and would consider them, but if price is an issue and they're still making the X67 for under $300, they're good units."
815422,AmblinRamblin3,2013-10-28 16:31:00,11,I also had the Lowrance X67c and loved it. Unfortunately it was not in the truck after an icefishing trip last winter. Someone at IBP lucked out at my expense. I am now looking for a replacement unit with same capability. Not interested in used 67c. They just don't make things they was they used too!

815428,ckrb2007,2013-10-28 17:08:00,449,"I had an x67c for years and loved it. Did everything I needed in a fish finder. I decided to upgrade so I picked up a Marcum LX7. WOW! Sick piece of machinery! Now it's staring at me until the ice hits! IMO, you definitely need a graph in order to see the ""history"" of the fish....especially in deep water. (ie Lake Simcoe lakers) The LX7 and x67 both have flasher modes which are as close to real time as the human eye can tell. Better to have several choices/options in a fish finder then just one."
815430,crappieperchhunter,2013-10-28 17:54:00,2582,I have an old FL8 Vex that I got second hand from a board member. It does what I need it to do.  Combined with a lower end hand held GPS. That's pretty much as high tech as I will ever need to help me catch fish.
815432,Fang,2013-10-28 18:27:00,1330,"This will be one those items debated for a long time  I've used them all right back to my first experience lake trout fishing in temagami with the lowrance little green box  they both have benefits but the old stereo types about flashers are the only ""real time"" fish finder is a load of bull now.  For me it's a fish finder all the way. I use a HB 798 color and with the higher powered colored units you can switch between sonar screen and an exact flasher output screen but still have GPS, multi zoom. And yes have used my HB and then switched over to a HB 45 a few yards away. Pretty much the same response.  Not to mention loading high res navionic maps and using them to get onto new spots  Heck I can even record my sonar screen for fancy OFC reports but as yet I haven't figured that out."
815435,Christopheraaron,2013-10-28 19:01:00,3525,Murcums are awesome machines! I don't own one but I've used friends' and they generally don't see much of it for the rest of the day
815446,bdox,2013-10-28 20:22:00,329,My ice fishing partner and I went from a finder to a Humminbird ICE 55 flasher last year. It was almost immediately noticable we were hooking up with more fish. Anyone who says movable zoom is overrated obviously hasn't saved a day of fishing by using it on light biting suspending walleye on Quinte.

814700,Stoty,2013-10-24 02:35:00,2910,Vexilar... hands down! Worth their weight in gold! (literally for Quinte)

814705,TDunn,2013-10-24 02:46:00,680,A flasher with zoom....I use a fl18 but I'm pretty sure all Hbirds have zoom. I believe the Hbirds 35's are reasonably priced.  TDunn
814708,DRIFTER_016,2013-10-24 03:09:00,10439,"Can't really go wrong with Vex, HB or Marcum. I have a Marcum and it's a great tool. Tried a regular FF but it's just too cold for them up here. The screen just slows down way too much. Not an issue with a proper ice fishing flasher or LCD sonar with a heated screen like Marcum's LX-7. The Vex's have a fixed zoom (bottom) while the HB's and Marcum's zoom can be placed anywhere in the water column. This can be important if you fish suspended fish like crappies."
814714,mike rousseau,2013-10-24 06:44:00,4661, X 2  I sold my vex to help pay for my humminbird 597 ci hd di and portable pack..  No regrets...  More options and built in GPS... And all my waypoints from soft water because I use this unit in my boat....  Vex has a good product... But it's a single purpose tool...
814715,Handlebarz,2013-10-24 08:57:00,3790,I was going to buy a black Vex But a friend told me to try my Lawerence 522c  it worked great. Like Mike said you have your GPS marks from summer And sonar as the right sidebar which is the live screen of what is under you. It's also nice to see what past underneath you if you have been looking away talking or checking tip ups. The only downfall is if you're fishing with guys using the vex and they have the sensitivity all the way up it will interfere you will have to adjust your screen.  All the years I was icefishing before using sonar I never realized the Pickrell would swim 6 foot off the bottom the year I startd to use my fishfinder I spotted them and started to catch them it helped the number on the ice go way up.  But you need to have a good sonar not a cheaper one.
814716,Joeytier,2013-10-24 09:24:00,3990,"I have an Fl-18, and i love it.  In my opinion the vex and Marcum's are far superior to the humminbirds.  The only feature my fl-18 doesnt have is zoom, which can be handy for certain situations but is mostly an overrated feature imo.  The tri beam transducer is the most important feature for me.  A good quality graph works great, but the battery life isnt nearly what you get from a vex from what ive seen.  I can usually get 6-7 full trips on a single charge no matter the weather, and are typically a little tougher than a big lcd graph, especially if youre taking it out 5 months a year like me.  Just my 0.02"
814718,Fisherpete,2013-10-24 10:13:00,1814,It would help if we knew your budget - most flashers are $350+  Pete
814726,wallyboss,2013-10-24 11:48:00,1095,The moveable Zoom is kind of overrated.  The only place that you really need a zoom is for the bottom.
814739,BillM,2013-10-24 13:21:00,17367,"Yeah, don't buy a flasher, get a regular fisfinder and iceducer.  Bingo."
814740,limeyangler,2013-10-24 13:23:00,5204,"     Yeah, i have one of those too (X-4), not the best on the market but you get what you pay for, i only bought it for the transducer as my other one was kaput and when it was on sale was cheaper than ordering a new seperate transducer.  All the arguments for and against flasher/fishfinders are going to come up here probably....does every year without fail.  The flasher crew have relaxed a bit since the LX-7 came out and broke their own taboo about using graphs on the ice and all the old myths about freeze up/ lags/power etc..etc...etc...and are actually even a bit smug and delusional on some websites acting as if they invented the concept and now we all need to know about it.  To be honest i would say that both are excellent tools....preference plays a role here too. I hate looking at the whirly circle display and value the 'screen memory' you get using a graph, it gives me a much better feel for how the fish is moving/reacting than when i use a flasher....yes i have used both, my graph fishfinder has a digital flasher and i have used an fl-18 (vexilar).   Drifter made the point about the screen slowing down/freezing and that some flashers have heated screens. This will happen i guess at the temperatures he regularly 'boasts' about (crazy sod) but i have had my graph out all day at -20C and below  with none of the issues he mentions(you will want a colour TFT LCD)....even the battery will last for 2 or 3 trips at those temps. So, i dont need a heated screen, so as a feature it is redundant to my needs, cuz any colder than -25C will see in my portable shack for most of the day anyway, no need for a heated screen.  I think Mike hits the nail on the head.....Flashers are a single use tool....although obviously they can and are used on a boats.  If you choose the flasher over a graph Marcum and Hummingbird appear to be the most innovative when it comes to flashers, Vexilar appear to be the Yamaha Bravo of the bunch...it will never let you down. Split zoom is your friend."

814750,limeyangler,2013-10-24 14:01:00,5204,I would probably be considered 'Old Skool' now. I have an old  Lowrance X-67c. They are discontinued by Lowrance....but it is still an awesome unit....if you decide on a graph wont hurt looking on Ebay to pick one up.
814751,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2013-10-24 14:15:00,0,"i use a humminbird... great flasher... just make sure you buy a 45 or 55, or one of the more powerful vexilars if you plan on fishing the depths for lakers...  people will debate the merits of each, and they both have their pros and cons...  i however enjoy using a vexilar... i find it easier to see on sunny days or inside the darkness of my portable hut."

814772,adempsey,2013-10-24 16:30:00,1498,"I've used a Marcum LX-5 for the past few years and love it.   My buddy really likes his Lowrance Ice X67 [forget the actual unit, but it's the ice model].    I think the Lowrance is a great unit as well.  So, I think a better question is what technology do you prefer - a flasher or a graph?    They both work just fine for ice fishing.  As it stands now, I don't really think the flashers have any advantage over the portable graph models these days.   I believe features like sensitivity, power consumption, response time, weight and environmental resilience are very similar.  However, the graph models are easier to use initially [since that's what you likely use already] and the history is nice.   Also, if you plan on using this unit during the summer as well it's probably ideal to have a graph model."

814788,Dan668,2013-10-24 18:09:00,1120,Had a Marcum lx-7 for a bit. Sold it and just used my HDS-7 off the boat. Prefered the fish finder over the flasher. Plus saved myself some cash. But i sold my HDS-7 just after winter. Going to have to think of a setup with my HDS-8 now lol

Hummingbird does one model of iceducer for their flasher units and one for the graph units. From the looks of it the iceducer for HB graph units does not support your 898 model.   http://ca.humminbird.com/products/314001/XI_9_20"
