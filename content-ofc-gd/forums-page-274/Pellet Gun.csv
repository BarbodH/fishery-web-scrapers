816132,ch312,2013-11-01 16:02:00,1590," If I remember correctly, anyone found in the woods with a firearm was deemed to be hunting.  Would this apply to an air pistol?   From the MNR website:  Question Re: Non-hunter Vs Hunter and Licence Requirements I am 20 years old and from a family of non-hunters, but I enjoy hunting of all kinds. I don't have many other people to go out deer hunting with, and since it is dangerous to go alone my dad often comes with me for company. He doesn't have a hunting licence, but he enjoys being with me, and dresses in orange just to be safe. We were told that is illegal for him to do this and he can be charged with illegal hunting even if he isn't carrying a gun? How can this be? Aren't crown lands open for everyone to use, not just hunters during hunting season? How can he be charged for simply walking around in the bush with me?  Answer: This practice is absolutely legal if the non-hunter does not actively participate in the hunt. Let me give you a couple of scenarios to explain this:  Clearly, anyone can simply walk around on crown (or private, with permission) land but once there is any indication that they are actively involved in 'chasing, pursuing, in search of,.' then they are liable to the requirement for a hunting licence and may be charged if they do not have one - whether or not they have a firearm! Firearms include rifles, shotguns, air or pellet guns, bows and crossbows. You may use semi-automatic or repeating firearms for hunting in Ontario, but not handguns or fully automatic firearms. Air and pellet pistols with a muzzle velocity less than 500 feet per second may be used for hunting in Ontario.  This is from the CFC web site Facts Sheet;  Air Guns  http://www.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/cfp-pcaf/f...me_air-eng.htm  If you own or want to acquire an air gun, here is some information you should know about how the Firearms Act and the Criminal Code apply to them.     Air guns (also known as BB guns, pellet guns, spring guns or air soft guns) fall into three categories:  1. Air guns that are firearms for purposes of both the Firearms Act and the Criminal Code.  These are air guns with both a high muzzle velocity (greater than 152.4 meters or 500 feet per second) and a high muzzle energy (greater than 5.7 joules or 4.2 foot-pounds). The “muzzle velocity” is the speed of a projectile at the instant it leaves the muzzle of a gun, normally expressed in metres per second or feet per second. The “muzzle energy” is the energy of a projectile at the instant it leaves the muzzle of a gun, expressed in joules or foot-pounds. Air guns need to meet both standards to be classified as firearms for purposes of the Firearms Act. These high-powered air guns are subject to the same licence and registration requirements as a conventional firearm. You are also required to store, transport, display and handle them safely in accordance with the regulations supporting the Firearms Act. Usually, the manufacturer’s specifications are used to determine what muzzle velocity and muzzle energy an air gun was designed to have. This information may be available in the user’s manual or on the manufacturer’s web site. If the information is not available, individuals can call 1 800 731-4000 and ask to speak to a firearms technician to find out if the air gun is classified as a firearm for purposes of the Firearms Act. High-powered air rifles are classified as non-restricted firearms. High-powered air pistols are classified as restricted if their barrel is longer than 105 mm or prohibited if their barrel length is 105 mm or less."

My question is would you need to have a hunting lisence to hunt small game with this pellet gun or how does that work with a pellet gun?  Thanks,  Tight Lines! "
815781,NAW,2013-10-30 21:02:00,4022,"To the best of my knowledge, you need a hunting licence to hunt.  It makes no difference weather you are using a gun, bow or pellet gun.  You still need a valid hunting licence."

I believe some provinces still allow .177 rimfire .  Hope this helped"

You soon found out that you can jam the barrel in the mud and shoot people with them.  or  The spring loaded BB gun that would barely break the skin if you shot your brother with it from 5 feet away. I remember many a BB gun fight in the neighborhood with ""bugbites"" as we told our moms.

Correct, a handgun cannot be used for hunting in Ontario. But, an air pistol that is slower than 500 fps is not defined as a handgun so it is legal to use for hunting. No PAL is required to own an under 500 fps air pistol, but a RPAL (restricted firearms license) is required to buy and own an air pistol that shoots faster than 500 fps and can only be used at approved ranges.  An air rifle under 500 fps does not require a PAL either, but it is required once you break 500 fps. "
