815505,Joey,2013-10-29 04:30:00,9122,"This is all I could find Shawn  PARK HEAD - A police helicopter joined the search Sunday for a missing boater who went out in a dinghy and was last seen Thursday night. A police update Sunday morning said family members of the missing person would be assisting members of the OPP emergency response team and Bruce Peninsula OPP officers in the ground search. OPP search and recovery team members scanned the river Saturday by boat using sonar in the fast-moving, turbid and swollen river near Park Head, southwest of Hepworth. The missing person's name has so far not been released at the request of family members, Const. Peter Zehr said in a news release. “The OPP continue to ask for the help of the public should they see anything that may assist in this investigation of a missing person,” Zehr said. Saturday a woman and two young men stood on the bridge overlooking the river and old mill dam one sideroad west of Park Head. They confirmed they were family members but the woman said the family wished not to comment. They were seen later one concession farther south, standing beside the river at the end of Salem Rd. A police SUV was parked there and two police vehicles were nearby. Police vehicles were also parked at the Park Head United Church and memorial hall, where they maintained an outpost.A police helicopter is to join the search today for a missing boater who went out in a dinghy and was last seen Thursday night."
