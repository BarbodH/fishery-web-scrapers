I am considering 'upgrading' my rear graph (Elite-5) to an Elite-7 HDI this offseason which has the Insight Genesis stuff.. ability to map uncharted waters and I understand Lowrance has now given us the ability to keep our logs private.. so that's good.  I understand you need the $99 yearly sub to be able to download the info back to your graph and without the sub you can log/view just can't download.  Just wondering i) your thoughts, how well it works? ii) walk me through the process of being on the water logging the data to uploading to their site, to getting it back onto your graph.  no comments about hbird able to do this for free, it'll be a cold day in hell before i switch to hummingbird."

815952,BillM,2013-10-31 20:32:00,17367,$99 a year sounds like a ripoff.   Check out Reefmaster...  http://reefmaster.com.au/
816000,Raf,2013-10-31 23:53:00,3495,It's interesting Bill but it sounds like there's waaaay more fiddling required.  Time is money.. and it's also at a premium these days.  the navico solution looks to be way more painless.  I'll have a closer look though.  Thanks for the link Steve.
