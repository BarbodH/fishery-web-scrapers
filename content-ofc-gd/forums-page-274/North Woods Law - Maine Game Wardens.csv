815058,farsider,2013-10-25 23:17:00,456,"I stumbled on a show during one of the free cable preview dealies on the Animal Planet channel called ""North Woods Law"".It follows the Game Wardens of Maine as they go about their business. Its interesting and they do a decent job with the show.It airs on Thursday night at 10:00 and is rebroadcast a few other times throughout the week.Here is a short clipIts also interesting because you learn some of the little differences with the law and regulations compared to Ontario.Some examples:It is illegal to do a Deer Drive there. A fairly common practice for the older generation here.All Bear bait sites have to be a certain distance away from the public and labelled with the hunters info.All tree stands also have to be labelled with the hunters info. This could prove useful here.It is illegal to bait for Deer there.At any rate, it is worth a look.Cheers,Mark"
