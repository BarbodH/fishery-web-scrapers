815466,glen,2013-10-28 23:19:00,2641,"Forest worker's close encounter with aggressive wolf pack prompts safety warning A+ BY THE CANADIAN PRESS, OCTOBER 28, 2013 MERRITT, B.C. - British Columbia's forest safety council has issued an unusual safety alert after a forestry worker narrowly escaped a pack of wolves while working in the province's southern Interior.  The bulletin says a woman working for a forest management firm was approached by at least five aggressive wolves while she was working near Merritt two weeks ago.  The warning says the wolves came within three metres of her, and as the woman reached for a can of bear spray, one of her two dogs tried to take on the wolves.  The B.C. Forest Safety Council says the woman managed to make it back to her truck uninjured and called for help.  The dog that fought with the wolves was badly injured and had to be put down.  The bulletin says anyone who encounters wolves should raise their arms to make themselves appear larger, make loud noises, and use bear mace if the animals get close enough."

815625,aplumma,2013-10-29 23:46:00,6896,We tried metric once but them we found out we were to stupid to learn math again. I personally find metric much easier to work with especially when dealing with mechanical repairs.   Art
