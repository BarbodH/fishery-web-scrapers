813748,ch312,2013-10-19 16:20:00,1590, Or pick them yourself at night after a rain on the street or sidewalk. Alternatively you can look on your lawn for the ones right on top of the grass - especially the ones that are 'getting kinky' with one another. You'll get twice as many in half the time with only 1/8th the effort.LOL  After put them in a small container with shredded wet newspapers. A lot less messy than worms packed in dirt  Or start an indoor compost bin (zero smell) with red wigglers aka trout worms and you'll have an unlimited supply in no time. To harvest the worms you simply keep a melon rind or newspaper dampened with juice just below the surface so when you lift it there's hundreds of worms ready to be fish bait.  No more smelly kitchen garbage as funky smells are usually caused by fruit and veggies and you get the best garden fertilizer out there.

We keep a small tote, that doesn't attract bugs or smell either, in the kitchen and place all of our scraps in it and dump it in the composting bin every couple days. You'd be surprised by how much organic waste each household sends to landfills and even more surprised by how fast the little army can turn some fruit and veggies into rich compost.  Google ""vermicomposting"" or ""perpetual vermicomposting bin"" if you're interested in getting started."

813332,canadadude,2013-10-17 16:04:00,769,"To understand why the hook is dropped 1""-2"" below the bead you first have to understand how trout feed on single eggs. When a trout is feeding on eggs it sucks the egg in instantly into it's throat much like a vacum, this is how it takes a bead. By dropping the hook below the bead the hook will be in fact in the mouth part of the fish and not in it's throat, thus making it easier to hook a fish in the mouth.A trout can also almost instantly spit the bead out and with the hook dropped it is still in it's mouth and increases the chances of hook-ups. This is the reason hooks are fish dropped below the bead when fished."

812701,Garnet,2013-10-13 23:56:00,2056,Single eggs are terrible for hooking trout deep. So bad I stopped using them 30 years ago. Fish with a guy that single eggs often about 80% deep hooked.  They real pt. is you are almost never hooking fish with a bead outside the mouth. If the hook is outside the mouth 1-2 inches you just miss the fish.

812967,Djeep,2013-10-15 20:13:00,199,"as someone who fishes the tribs occasionally without much guidance from experienced anglers, i wonder what the proper leader length is to avoid flossing? originally i heard 1.5x the depth of water but have also heard that if drifting properly only 1x the water depth is needed.  basically i fly fish with single eggs and this accounts for the majority of my hookups. id hate to think these are all lined fish  on a side note, i have witnessed small chromers aggressively pursue and take drifting single egg but only once"
812973,Garnet,2013-10-15 20:50:00,2056,My goal is to have the bead in the trouts throat and the hook still in there mouth. So I set the hook and catch the fish on the inside of the mouth. Most of the eastern tribs we are dealing with 8-10lb trout and likely 3.5-4 inch would be max.  And the sweet spot to hook a fish outside mouth is very narrow. The hook would need to just in the perfect spot. And if you go to long you just miss the miss.  If you are consistently hooking fish on the outside of the mouth you need to adjust.
812980,davey buoy,2013-10-15 21:22:00,5505,"That's exactly what I'm working with.Hooked one early afternoon,caught him on the outside of the corner of the mouth.Not what I'm looking for,but more experimenting is needed on my part.The hook was only 2"" below the bead.Still learning.Will close that up a tad.Released for another day."

812998,FloatnFly,2013-10-15 23:17:00,1640,"generally speaking, trout have a narrow mouth, like 3-4 inches across, so running your bead 2 inches or more above the hook will put your hook outside the mouth"

I contacted Wil Wegman on this issue. He said MNR had a 6 page document on legal not legal.  And it was legal with some interpretation.

I ended up fishing with him for the next two hours and was schooled 7-2 (beads vs roe).  All of his fish were hooked in the top of the mouth.  I would not have believed this if i did not see it with my own eyes. He also mentioned a CO approached him a few years ago, asking why he was snagging fish?

812590,Garnet,2013-10-13 13:08:00,2056,Most beads setups I've seen the hook is 3 inch from bead. So my ? to Wil Wegman if this was un baited hook.
812604,crappieperchhunter,2013-10-13 14:17:00,2582,"If the hook is not in the fishes mouth when the hook is set then in my eyes it is a snagged fish.  Just because a technique has been developed that makes that hook ""snag"" legally in the fishes mouth..doesn't mean it's not snagging.  That's my opinion and I'm entitled to it."
812640,Twocoda,2013-10-13 17:51:00,4130,whats the distance from the hook to the jig and spinner on a erie deerie or off the back of a spoon or J plug trolled out in the lake ....have you ever trolled with cut bait before?....i dont consider any of these distances from bait to hook as flossing ....
812658,Garnet,2013-10-13 19:50:00,2056,You can fish single eggs and leave a hook in 90% of your c&r fish.  Or you can let the fish suck the bead into there throat and the hook still in there mouth. So when you set the hook the fish is hooked in the mouth.  If you run your bead to far above the hook it's outside of the mouth and you just miss the fish.  Hooking a fish around the mouth like flossing is a very very small %.
812678,BillM,2013-10-13 22:20:00,17367,"Why are you leaving hooks in 90% of your released fish?  I think steelhead are the one fish where I never hook them deep in the mouth, regardless of what I'm fishing with (singles, normal bags, big bombers, jigs, whatever)."
812166,Jarfish,2013-10-11 02:35:00,20,"So I was out in the boat with a buddy of mine and he was mentioning a way his friend fishes. He was saying his friend float fishes with a trout bead about 2 inches above the hook and that it keeps the fish from getting gut hooked so he can release them if he wants. I guess the fish hits the bead and the hook catches him just in the corner of the mouth. I'm kind of on the fence with this as it's not a super long leader so the fish is actually trying to bite the bait but its also hooking outside of the mouth I would assume, which is snagging to me..I guess either way the regs say if its not in the mouth it's snagging and must be released. Whats you guys take on it? Here's a 14 min video that makes it seem a legitimate tactic http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_8uBBNTI4c"
812167,Christopheraaron,2013-10-11 02:43:00,3525,No.
812170,dave524,2013-10-11 02:51:00,4508,"The regs say in the mouth, not inside the mouth. Most fish I get on a stickbait like a Rapala, with 2 or 3 trebles will have a hook somewhere outside of the actual mouth, guess they are all snagged too"
812174,Jarfish,2013-10-11 03:00:00,20,"Most of the time when I get a fish on a Rapala or any 2-3 hook lures at least 1 of the hooks is ""inside"" the mouth, and if there wasn't yes i would consider that a snagged fish and throw it back."
812189,Rich,2013-10-11 10:27:00,3927,The cheater hook above your main hook with the bead above is certainly setup for flossing under the float. I've been explained the dynamics a few times. Steelheaders make it sound better... But that is definitely what they're doing.
812197,miller,2013-10-11 12:24:00,223,Really? Hahahaha wow...
812202,crappieperchhunter,2013-10-11 13:02:00,2582,"I have never done it or seen the set up....but the lack of feedback from the hard core trout guys on here pretty much confirms what I already thought of the rig.  It appears to be the river version of those nasty  side hooks on the williams for ice fishing....nudge, nudge,wink,wink."
812209,Ralph Field,2013-10-11 13:46:00,1018,"Not flossing at all, the intent is to catch fish without hooking them deeply so they may be released without harm. I have yet to catch a fish on a bead with the hook outside of the mouth, but I can see it happening. Now that I've said this I'll likely start catching them with the hook outside the mouth and have to continue to release them for a different reason."
812217,laszlo,2013-10-11 14:18:00,487,No it is not flossing.  All my fish on beads are hooked inside the mouth and all are released successfully because the hook isn't deep in its throat.
812224,crappieperchhunter,2013-10-11 14:34:00,2582,No it is not flossing.  All my fish on beads are hooked inside the mouth and all are released successfully because the hook isn't deep in its throat. When is the hook ever deep in the throat when you fish under a float? I have never seen that happen...ever...for trout or any other species I've fished under a float.  Edit to add. Except for Northerns using minnows under a float.
812226,DRIFTER_016,2013-10-11 14:48:00,10439,No it is not flossing at all. The reason for the gap between the hook and bead is to make the bead look more like a natural egg. This is key when fishing pressured fish. I fish the Kenai River in Alaska every fall and bead fishing was invented here. They estimate that each trout and dolly in the river (90 miles long) gets caught 20 times per year!!! The fish have seen a lot of baits over the years and can be very selective. You can tell when your bead has slipped down to the hook as you will stop getting hits.
812229,bare foot wader,2013-10-11 15:03:00,1354,"no, beads aren't flossing, the fish hit them becasue they are a natural, finesse single egg presentation....they can be used to floss, just like any other bait, just depends on the angler holding the rod  if you fish steelhead/salmon you WILL occasionally floss a fish, it's part of the game, get used to the idea or give up fishing....no different than snagging a walleye or bass in the back with a rapala, which I think most guys have done a few times over the years"
812243,blaque,2013-10-11 15:54:00,2419,"Ive only bead fished a time or two, but dont see how it can be considered ""flossing"" based on the rig itself"
812249,Dozer,2013-10-11 16:05:00,896,"Why would you waste a bead if you wanted to floss? lol  The hook is a short distance away from the bead so the hook is well exposed ( increase the chances of a good hook up )  The fish attack the beads for food or to increase chances the survival of their own progeny by destroying other eggs.  Beads are great and at times, outperform anything else presented."
812251,mike rousseau,2013-10-11 16:10:00,4661,"If I understand the OPs thinking here....  It would appear that the trout eats the bead and when the angler sets into the fish.... The hook then makes contact with the fish....  I would think when any decent size trout takes a bead the hook would get sucked in its mouth with the bead... There's only a 2"" gap from what I've read...."
812285,crappieperchhunter,2013-10-11 17:54:00,2582,"If I understand the OPs thinking here....  It would appear that the trout eats the bead and when the angler sets into the fish....

There's only a 2"" gap from what I've read.... So it is essentially the same concept as a hair rig for carp fishing? The fish sucks in the hook on the take, or is the hook raked into the fishes mouth when the fisherman sets the hook?  Anyone wanna chime in and educate me/us some more?"
812289,blaque,2013-10-11 18:12:00,2419,"The fish takes the bead, the fisherman sets the hook, the fish gets caught...........i think thats about it"
812292,mike rousseau,2013-10-11 18:32:00,4661, That's what it seams like to me...  No different then a carp rig....  Or a spoon with a bait less dropper hook..
812293,JoshS,2013-10-11 18:44:00,729,"What's the big deal?? The fish went for the bait, hit the bead. That is fishing... fooling a fish into eating your lure. It is not anything like snagging."
812296,misfish,2013-10-11 18:51:00,29133,"My set up now a days, is to have a bead on my line at all times. Weather it be 2 inches above the hook,or slide it way up 12 inches to the lowest shot. It,s not that I am flossing,but just saves from retieing.  When I put the bead up that high,it,s only because I,m drifting a roe sac or a worm.  Then again,,,,,,,,,,  I will run a bright pink bead in dirty waters about 6 inches up,BUT,theres a sac or worm on the hook. To me,it adds a better visual for the fish.  Second year for me trying the bead method. Caught 2 fish so far,and both were IN the yap..  To answer your ?   NO"
812310,porkpie,2013-10-11 20:25:00,2521,"Beads can be a flossing tool, that doesn't mean they are one.  I have caught fish on beads, and have watched people catch on bead, even in some pretty deep holes and wAter where lining woulld be difficult if not impossible.  I have also watched guys fish mega long leads in clear water on spooked fish in shallow runs and ""I believe"" they where flossing, and frankly I am pretty sure they knew what they where doing.  Beads catch fish, if you don't believe they do, then you've never fished a single egg bite!  But, when the float drops you'd better hit em fast, as they don't seem to hold it like a bag."
812311,Garnet,2013-10-11 20:26:00,2056,I contacted Wil Wegman on this issue. He said MNR had a 6 page document on legal not legal.  And it was legal with some interpretation.  Just from experience if MNR wrote 6 pages their will be 15 loopholes. Still would like to read it myself.
812313,misfish,2013-10-11 20:33:00,29133,"  THANK YOU.  Single egg bite .  Now theres some memories.  Slow moving current,single boiled egg(salmon egg) KILLER."
812319,JoshS,2013-10-11 20:57:00,729,"I don't see any issue. There's a big difference between lining a fish vs getting a fish to bite a bead. One is snagging, the other is fishing."
812320,davey buoy,2013-10-11 21:07:00,5505,"I don't see any issue. There's a big difference between lining a fish vs getting a fish to bite a bead. One is snagging, the other is fishing. I think you pretty well summed that up!!!"
