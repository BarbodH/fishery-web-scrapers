As I said in my last post, my wife has been my number 1 fishing partner for the last 10 years. It's always a competition and now that I look through some pictures, she's caught some impressive fish. These are some of our biggest fish. Keep in mind while looking at the following pictures, I'm 240lbs and she's about 130 so my fish may not look as big as hers but 90% of them are bigger. You can be the judges, Salmon   We don't hold them up like this any more. I tail them and support under their heads now. Browns   50"" musky  46""  Walleye   Lakers   Brookies   Bass   Northerns   Rainbows  "
