739847,dhickey,2012-10-27 04:20:00,1038,Just wondering if centrepins work on the ice? Seems to me they would have a tendancy to freeze up? Never tryed one on ice but thinking about trying one.  Are they worth 50-90 $ for an ice fishing combo?  They look like it would be a blast with pike or lakers if the reel doesnt freeze up?  Any advice or commets would be welcome.

740030,Joeytier,2012-10-27 22:24:00,3990,I use a small fly reel for panfish and through the ice.  Centerpin would be super fun for bigger fish

740421,dhickey,2012-10-29 04:13:00,1038,Ok so it sounds like a centerpin would be fun . But not worth it on ice.?  Having been a die hard hands on ice fisherman I can say that a spinning reel just doesnt hold up to winter conditions?  Whats the differance between centerpins for river fishing or fly reels?  What do you guys think?  Dont forget that I have no problem useing my hands for pulling in lakers or pike but age is starting to take its toll on my hands.  Spinning reels dont realy turn me on its to mutch like shooting fish in a bucket.  Just looking for a new rush..  Bring on the ice Santa....

740453,BillM,2012-10-29 12:46:00,17367,I can't imagine palming a centerpin in -30 degree weather would be any fun.  Give me a baitcast/spinning reel over that any day.
