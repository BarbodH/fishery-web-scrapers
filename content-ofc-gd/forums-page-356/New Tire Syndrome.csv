740771,NAW,2012-10-30 14:33:00,4022,  I ask for that every Christmas!!
740782,Harrison,2012-10-30 15:32:00,2202,I cringed as I looked at the pics.  Been there.  A block and tackle saved my arse a couple times.  Actually twice on the way into Lingham alone
740784,ckrb2007,2012-10-30 15:41:00,449,"It looked so ""do-able"" though, didn't it!! lol"
740789,Rod Caster,2012-10-30 15:59:00,5784,"  yup. Who knew muskeg offered little to no traction, eh??   I bought some wheel grips the other day...still considering a winch, farm jack and/or block and tackle. For now, it's dry land only until my muscles fully recover."
740791,fishnsled,2012-10-30 16:03:00,3520,  I can imagine it was quite the workout. All's well that ends well and a story to tell for years to come.
740810,bdox,2012-10-30 17:26:00,329,"It can happen to anyone. I got my old ZR2 Blazer stuck. It had 4x4, locking diff, 33"" tires, 16"" ground clearance. I was on a trail I had just been on a week before. It was spring, and someone with much bigger tires had gone through the trail and just ripped it up, leaving 2' deep ruts. Well, I saw them and tried to ride outside of them but on a turn I got sucked into the ruts, and was sitting on front and rear differentials. I had absolutely nothing with me, it was late on a Sunday, and who woulda thought that there aren't any off-road towing companies in the golden horseshoe? Luckily this trail is just on the outskirts of the city and I was only 500m off a main road. I eventually called my mechanic, who came out the next day while I was at work and got it unstuck and back to the garage and cleaned up. Luckily the only thing that needed replacing was a mud covered serpentine belt!  With that said, these are the things that I will never go off-road without.  1. 60"" Hi-Lift jack and base (can be used for lifting or pulling) 2. 10,000lb tow strap 3. Receiver/Shackle combo + extra shackles 4. 100' / 8000lb Synthetic Winch cable 5. 20,000lb snatch block 6. shovel"
740853,jimmer,2012-10-30 19:37:00,2730,That must have been a sinking feeling!
740052,Rod Caster,2012-10-27 23:21:00,5784,"Well today's plans were completely altered. What was supposed to be a rainbow trout-fest quickly turned into a mud slinging, shovel breaking, rock hauling, boot pulling, tire spinning, off-road recovery calling mishap....with a happy ending.  A friend and I drove my truck into what is normally a 4-wheeler trail leading to a small rainbow lake. I bought new meaty tires a couple weeks ago, so my off-road confidence was running high...too high. As we approached the final 50 feet, in an area which would have been a perfect place to unload gear, I decide (foolishly) to continue towards to lake; I mean who the hell wants to walk 50 feet, right? I drove right into muskeg and was screwed the moment I chose to turn around instead of backing out.  4 hours of trying every single option we could think of and I broke down and called the local off-road recovery, Bartlett's Towing. The driver executed the recovery with ease and did not damage my truck.  Now I know how far off road my truck can go  We decided to follow a couple trails and my friend took out 5 partridge, so the day ended on a high note  I'm going to sleep well tonight.                    "
740054,Joeytier,2012-10-27 23:25:00,3990,Oiii vey...4 hours??  Should have just called them and started casting
740055,irishfield,2012-10-27 23:27:00,26272,Someone's asking Honey for a winch and a snatch block for Christmas !!
740057,kickingfrog,2012-10-27 23:31:00,8333,The air would have been a very dark blue. Most of us have likley had similar incidents. Glad it all worked out.   btw: To keep your back lake trout spot a secret did you tell the tow guy that you and your buddy were looking for some alone time?
740062,Raf,2012-10-27 23:34:00,3495,"<looks at rescue vehicle>  Shoulda bought a Jeep.  JK, that sure looks stuck.  Been there, not fun, even in a Jeep.  Does the mazda have locking diff(s)?"
740064,GBW,2012-10-27 23:38:00,8460,I see the problem here...  It's M if an F body and if it was T you would have made it...
740065,spincast,2012-10-27 23:38:00,3279,"ouch, lb for lb them is some expensive birds huh Chad? Life is a great teacher - somehow I see winch on the xmas list......... did you at least launch? or was the mood gone by then?"
740075,Leecher,2012-10-27 23:54:00,7832,"With the camping gear in the back of the truck and the canoe on top, nothing to worry about Chad   Man.... WHAT WERE YOU THINKING    Looks like you sank pretty deep the minute you got greedy  At least you guys got birds for your troubles"
740076,Rod Caster,2012-10-27 23:54:00,5784,"A winch is exactly what I need. I'll probably get one that installs in my hitch recepticle. Also, some ""grip tracks"" would have helped tremendously. Also, need two new shovels and they both broke on us.  The mazda does not have a locking diff. I might look into adding that as a mod. The biggest pisser is the traction control in 4x4. Why the heck would anyone want to lose power to a wheel in 4x4??  Rick, we did not launch the canoe, as it was nearly 2pm by the time we were freed up, and I was completely bushed. It was much easier to just drive trails and look for birds."
740078,Rod Caster,2012-10-27 23:57:00,5784," hahaha. I was thinking ""There's no way it's THAT bad in there. "", or the alternative is "" I was not thinking at all""  I only ate half my sandwich at lunch, JUST INCASE."
740085,cheaptackle,2012-10-28 00:10:00,849,"Well, at least you didn't lock yer keys inna trunk - AGAIN! Might be time for you to buy a helicopter - and hire a PILOT!  Michael"
740089,Rod Caster,2012-10-28 00:17:00,5784," Funny you say that. During our lunch break we looked at the lake and said ""we need a plane"". At least when I lock my keys in the truck I can just use part of a fish stringer and break in."
740092,livinisfishin,2012-10-28 00:25:00,661,I wish i could try to attempt that.  My fusion would get hung up so fast...
740093,cheaptackle,2012-10-28 00:27:00,849,I was remembering how teh auto club were gonna send the tow truck from about 2 hrs away when that happened to you here - comparativley they would have sent a unit from toronto to yank you outta there! (no jeep either!)  Michael
740098,Rod Caster,2012-10-28 00:38:00,5784, oh yah! I forgot about that time.  I swear it's no more than once per year
740100,cheaptackle,2012-10-28 00:42:00,849, Once a year what?  That you remember?  Certainly not the frequency with which you .....  (fill in the blank!) (bet you and the missus have a riot filling in the ......)  Michael
740166,Photoz,2012-10-28 13:18:00,792,The difference between a 4-wheel drive & a 2-wheel drive . . . . .    the 4-wheeler will get you a half mile further into the bush before you get stuck!
740168,whiskywizard,2012-10-28 13:24:00,305, I really need to know what the scraper was for?
740172,Rod Caster,2012-10-28 13:49:00,5784, We broke a shovel and it was somewhat better than digging by hand.
740173,woodenboater,2012-10-28 13:54:00,2277," yup. been there, done that. got the t-shirt"
740175,SlowPoke,2012-10-28 13:55:00,2984,"There are very few situations that a Hi-Lift jack, some blood, sweat and tears can't get you out of. http://www.hi-lift.com/  One of the easiest ways to un-stick yourself is jacking the truck up by your receiver hitch as high as you can and pushing it sideways off the jack.  Plan B: A quality winch rated AT LEAST twice the weight of your truck"
740185,lew,2012-10-28 14:29:00,12766,"And if you are gonna use a jack in the mud, carry some wide boards to put under it to keep it from sinking too deep in the soft stuff."
740188,Rod Caster,2012-10-28 14:38:00,5784," I used to have a few pieces of plywood in the back of the truck, but junk piles up back there and I have to clean it out once in a while ... wish I had them yesterday. Those jacks they give you with the truck dislike everything except perfectly level/solid ground.  For the most part, I'm just gonna stay away from mud. I'll stick to small, dry trails as I initially planned."
740237,mike rousseau,2012-10-28 17:27:00,4661,Lol  That's not too bad... I buried my truck in snow... On the ice... And it took 3 days and a big tractor to get me out....lol  Just another story for the campfire....
740770,LucG,2012-10-30 14:27:00,779,Oh Chad!    haha  I don't know how I missed this post lol  Glad you (and your truck) made out in one piece.
