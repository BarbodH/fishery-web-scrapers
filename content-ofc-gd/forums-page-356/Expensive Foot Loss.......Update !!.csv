740286,kickingfrog,2012-10-28 20:09:00,8333,Well if you're a glass half full type at least the one was left to get them home.
740293,irishfield,2012-10-28 20:25:00,26272,Barrie police trailering accident again???
740294,kickingfrog,2012-10-28 20:42:00,8333,What is the broken part in the very top right of the first photo and then isolated in the second?
740295,BillM,2012-10-28 20:43:00,17367,I think that might be expensive.
740296,kickingfrog,2012-10-28 20:45:00,8333,Could have been twice as pricey.
740299,BillM,2012-10-28 21:13:00,17367,"That's probably the CG boat from Brit, lol."
740302,SlowPoke,2012-10-28 21:52:00,2984, That's the transom mount bracket but I can't for the life of me imagine how it could have been damaged. I wonder if this boat fell while loading it into a storage rack? Perhaps it was hit by another vehicle?
740303,Whitespinnerbait,2012-10-28 22:03:00,2038,I'm going to find out how it happened tomorrow
740305,Grimace,2012-10-28 23:05:00,2020,But other than that the trip went well?    :-)
740340,NAW,2012-10-29 00:46:00,4022,"Look around inside the boat for a box full of busted parts.  If he hit something in the water to cause that damage, he likely would not be able to find the bottom end.  If it was a trailering incident, I would think he would have grabbed the rest of the bottom end to scavenge parts."
740390,BillM,2012-10-29 02:46:00,17367,"If he hit something in the water, the odds are the other motor wouldn't be untouched (Or the bottom of the boat for that matter)"
740513,NBR,2012-10-29 15:30:00,163,I hit a rock with the bottom of the skeg while on plane. I snapped the lower off at about a 45 degree angle. We were at a boat in lodge and managed to get to the lodge on the TM. We got a tow back. Found a rebuilt lower in Ft. Francis and was back in the water in 2 days. If I remember correctly the repair was about $2500. The positive was that just before the rock jumped in front a wolf swam across the lake in front of us and we watched it climb out on to the bamk.

740900,irishfield,2012-10-30 21:32:00,26272,Does look like most dealers on our side of the border are looking for about 26 grand MSRP. Guess the Kbec police shop state side...
740904,Whitespinnerbait,2012-10-30 22:01:00,2038,  Take another peak at the trailer.....Ontario Plates !!!

740957,captpierre,2012-10-31 00:18:00,2521,What would the motor be worth as is?
740970,kickingfrog,2012-10-31 01:00:00,8333,Ten cents a pound.
741057,Harrison,2012-10-31 12:16:00,2202,Looks like someone took a sharp turn or a corner too wide and brought the back end out of the channel into a stump judging by the damage.  Must of been on a boaters card blitz.
741058,Harrison,2012-10-31 12:19:00,2202, I think we are the lucky ones as taxpayers.
