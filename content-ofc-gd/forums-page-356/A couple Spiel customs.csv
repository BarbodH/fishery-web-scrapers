740599,rhare,2012-10-29 21:37:00,387,"Just wanted to share with everyone a couple of the custom builds that Spiel has done for me this fall. I was fortunate to have Chris do a build for me last year and it turned out awesome. His attention to detail if amazing and if anyone is thinking of having a rod built I would suggest contacting him. Great guy to work with.  The first rod is a Rainshadow XST1382F 11'6""  I had this rod built for my wife for xmas. The handle is turned a bit smaller for her hands. It turned out awesome and pairs nicely with her pink steelheader.          The second rod is a Sage GllSH-1136-3LLB. A 13'6"" 3 piece. I picked up the blank last fall but didnt have a chance to have Chris build it until this fall. It turned out to be a beauty. The wood reel seat and inserts are made of big leaf burl maple and the pics really don't do it justice.             tightlines  Ryan"

740663,mercman,2012-10-30 02:14:00,7054,"I can't believe the attention to detail on these rods. From the thread and Laquer to the cork and inlays, true works of art."
740720,rhare,2012-10-30 10:50:00,387," Thanks again Mike, more then happy with the blank    Yeah I've kinda grown partial to them, really like them in the cold weather freeze up isn't much of a problem. They do make for nice light sticks"
740751,Fish Farmer,2012-10-30 13:02:00,2234,"Troutguy, if you look closely you may find my finger print on you rod.   I had the pleaser of holding that masterpiece. Beautiful piece of work. Now if I could only get the thought out of my head of him building me a Sheephead rod. But, I know what his thought would be"
740797,Spiel,2012-10-30 16:46:00,9065,"As always thanks guys!  I'm pleased your happy with them Ryan, hopefully you'll get to use them soon."
