740668,mistaredone,2012-10-30 02:25:00,913,"Got out on Friday afternoon to chase some LCS muskys with my best net man.  We had low expectations for the weekend with the weather forcast looking so poor but Friday turned out perfect.  We were on the water early afternoon with the plan of vertical jigging Bondy Baits and it didnt take long to get into the first fish.  A little guy but happy to get the skunk off the boat early.  It took a black Bondy Bait with orange flake in 18 fow      <a href=""http://s305.beta.photobucket.com/user/mistaredone/library/""'>http://s305.beta.photobucket.com/user/mistaredone/library/""'>http://s305.beta.photobucket.com/user/mistaredone/library/""'>http://s305.beta.photobucket.com/user/mistaredone/library/""'>http://s305.beta.photobucket.com/user/mistaredone/library/""'>http://s305.beta.photobucket.com/user/mistaredone/library/""'>http://s305.beta.photobucket.com/user/mistaredone/library/""'>http://s305.beta.photobucket.com/user/mistaredone/library/"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://i305.photobucket.com/albums/nn211/mistaredone/7BF254BF-75E1-4F72-8DDC-D6457D6B3748-582-0000006EF4ED4481-1.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""7BF254BF-75E1-4F72-8DDC-D6457D6B3748-582-0000006EF4ED4481""/></a>      Next fish came a hour or two later on the same Bondy Bait but this time in 26 fow.  I knew right away it was a good fish and after a short but great knee knocking fight he was in the net.  A PB for the fatest fish to grace my boat!!  Stoked!!!!!!!!!!!      <a href=""http://s305.beta.photobucket.com/user/mistaredone/library/"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://i305.photobucket.com/albums/nn211/mistaredone/E2144EB3-FA9D-41AC-AA23-77939F083ACA-582-0000006F357A70D5-1.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""E2144EB3-FA9D-41AC-AA23-77939F083ACA-582-0000006F357A70D5""/></a>      The release went well but I did notice the fish had blood shot eyes.  After 2 mins he powered out of my hand and straight down to fight another day.      <a href=""http://s305.beta.photobucket.com/user/mistaredone/library/"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://i305.photobucket.com/albums/nn211/mistaredone/3D7FE5E0-7862-4B3E-9977-9809C4D1F198-582-0000007015B9D4FB.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Uploaded from the Photobucket iPhone App""/></a>      My Bondy Bait was crushed and even one of the hooks snapped off      <a href=""http://s305.beta.photobucket.com/user/mistaredone/library/"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://i305.photobucket.com/albums/nn211/mistaredone/19725675-4EF5-4014-9CEF-8D226046F859-582-00000070869329CC.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Uploaded from the Photobucket iPhone App""/></a>      Sat down for the next 10 mins to change hooks and a high 5 marathon.  Not 10 mins later my 8' heavy doubles over again in 22 fow I start yelling BIG FISH!! and my buddy wont turn around thinking im joking.  A powerful run, tail dancing jump and a lap around the boat and staight in the net.       <a href=""http://s305.beta.photobucket.com/user/mistaredone/library/"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://i305.photobucket.com/albums/nn211/mistaredone/D42603A6-7F9B-4A11-9747-FD23687E2EED-582-0000007112DB9064-1.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""D42603A6-7F9B-4A11-9747-FD23687E2EED-582-0000007112DB9064""/></a>       I would have thought it was the same fish but this poor guy had a sea lamprey on him and a scared up back        <a href=""http://s305.beta.photobucket.com/user/mistaredone/library/"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://i305.photobucket.com/albums/nn211/mistaredone/07F7BB22-C123-44A8-9F74-B476E43D924A-582-000000711955736D.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Uploaded from the Photobucket iPhone App""/></a>       Another good release but blood shot eye lids again         <a href=""http://s305.beta.photobucket.com/user/mistaredone/library/"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://i305.photobucket.com/albums/nn211/mistaredone/5C6EA810-F886-469D-BAD2-7D7D40864CB2-582-000000713DAB4617.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Uploaded from the Photobucket iPhone App""/></a>       The fish finder looked better than demo mode the entire time         <a href=""http://s305.beta.photobucket.com/user/mistaredone/library/"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://i305.photobucket.com/albums/nn211/mistaredone/97D9A798-744E-4D5F-B97A-33568897F113-582-0000007350A27A3F.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Uploaded from the Photobucket iPhone App""/></a>        Saturday the wind was up and we were unable to control the vertical jigg so we sought shelter and threw bulldawgs for an hour with no luck.  Back to the bars.  Sunday was so miserable we didnt even launch but a great trip still"

740749,LucG,2012-10-30 12:59:00,779,Great report! and monster fish. Congrats!  I picked up a few bondy baits and havent tried them yet. Heard they are a great bait for deep water skis.
740767,Whitemikeca,2012-10-30 14:17:00,138,Nice haul Steve!  Great report.
740781,Moosebunk,2012-10-30 15:32:00,3970,"Wicked fishing dood!  Stared at that exact same Bondy on the shelf but bought the Pearl!  Figured, if only have one, it should be shad-like.  Looks as though you jigged the right one.  Great PB!"
740801,solopaddler,2012-10-30 17:05:00,8605,That is so unbelievably cool! The idea of jigging for those giant fish is definitely something I want to experience.  Well done!
