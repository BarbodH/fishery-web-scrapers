740475,LucG,2012-10-29 14:18:00,779,"Well, its that time of year again. My internal clock has changed from chasing fish to hunting fauna. I decided to take the boat out one last time on saturday to run a little fuel stabalizer through the system, and brough along a few rods as well. Was only out for a few hours but the fishing was great. Landed a few small pike, and dozens of agressive smallies. Very surprising considering the water temp was hovering around 50. Ended the day early as my hands started to stiffen up. I could barely grip onto these two brutes for the last pic of the year.    With the boat put away, my attention can now be 100% focused on deer hunting, and a little trapping as well. Sunday I headed into the bush to retreive my trail camera cards. I was pleased with what has been visiting my stands. I have three cameras throughout 100 acres, and managed over 1700 pics combined in less than a week.  This guy has been visiting both of my favorite stands, usually very close behind a group of does/fawns. A little young, but I think I'd still take him if the opportunity came.       I'm seeing lots of these...     and these...       I think this one is sticking her tongue out at me...     Also, I allways get other wildlife. I'll get these fox and marten once the hunt is over!           Hope you enjoyed the pics! Stay safe."
