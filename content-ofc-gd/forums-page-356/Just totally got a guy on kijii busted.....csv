739547,Steve,2012-10-25 16:19:00,2075,"Rangerguy, you are 100% correct.  whats even worse are those who step on the fish to ""assist"" in guiding out eggs, then chucking the fish back in the water, proudly exclaiming they are a ""sportsman"" who releases their fish."
739630,Rich,2012-10-25 23:37:00,3927,"Catch, fillet, release"
739644,BillM,2012-10-26 00:37:00,17367, I've never seen anyone step on a fish before to milk it... That would be something to see.
739656,funfishing,2012-10-26 01:24:00,147,"For those of you who don't know this:  All that is required to legally sell roe, is that you purchase it from an aquaculture source, and have proof in case of getting checked. No permit required to sell aquaculture roe. The receipt is a de facto permit. I know because I am a vendor."
739791,Steve,2012-10-26 23:05:00,2075,"BillM, go the the dalhousie ditch.  i've seen guys stepping on males wondering why the eggs aren't coming out.  i've seen guys stepping on females to the point the eyes of the fish were bulging out.  I can't for the life of me understand why anyone would want to fish that ditch, but its one of the most popular area's for raping browns around....so i guess if that's whats considered fun - all the power to ya!"
739826,BillM,2012-10-27 00:53:00,17367, No thanks... Only time I wander down that was is in the spring with the Lund to chase fish off Port Weller
739967,Steve,2012-10-27 19:57:00,2075,"I'd rather catch one legit brown in the lake than 10 browns in the ditch.  but I guess for those who don't have access to a boat, or aren't willing to work at a fish in a river, the dalhousie ditch is the way to go.  our crew call the ones who fish legally ""ditchfishers"" and those who go to get brown eggs ""ditchpigs""."
740153,bigredfisher,2012-10-28 08:50:00,300,Wow so I'm a weasel. Holy crap. Wow wonder why I don't post anymore
738895,bigredfisher,2012-10-23 01:37:00,300,Well saw one of them roe selling guys. I told him it was illegal and still continued to try to sell it to me. Called crimestoppers and they want me to forward the emails .... Totally busted lol
738905,cheaptackle,2012-10-23 01:47:00,849,The one for 3.00/dozen or 5.00/dozen?    Good job!  Michael
738909,mikeseb,2012-10-23 01:52:00,201,"Ata boy!  I think I remember a threat last winter about the same thing, what a shame man.  Next time arrange to meet the guy somewhere to buy the roe, and show up with a c.o and watch how fast he craps his pants LOL  Nothing like the feeling of busting a poacher"
738979,bigredfisher,2012-10-23 12:21:00,300,"Yea 3.00 a doz got all the proof lol his name, age, where he caught the fish, admitting he knows its illegal and phone number . Lol"
738980,BillM,2012-10-23 12:30:00,17367, Since when is the guy selling roe a poacher?   He seems more stupid then anything.
738983,Christopheraaron,2012-10-23 12:39:00,3525,"I just found one too, just sent him an email."
738985,kemper,2012-10-23 12:41:00,2232,"Bill, there are a bunch of guys out East way that zip anything they can snag at Ganny and then tie bags and sell them.  I believe it is illegal to sell roe as well, but I think the poaching angle is more from acquiring the roe..."
738986,RangerGuy,2012-10-23 12:50:00,564,"If you kill a fish just for roe, that's poaching in my eye's.."
738987,woodenboater,2012-10-23 12:54:00,2277,"from the MNR page...  ""Question Re: Using Fish Roe for Bait Fishing with single fish eggs or roe bags is very effective at times during the fall salmon run. Can I use the eggs from fish that I catch as bait?  Answer: Fish roe (eggs) is common bait especially for salmon and trout fishing. The using of roe is not restricted by any laws provided that there is no prohibition against using organic bait the area you are fishing (areas where artificial lure or artificial fly may only be sued).  Fish roe may be legally stripped (taken) from fish that are legally caught provided that the fish itself is not discarded and wasted. You may also give fish roe to other anglers for their use but an angler may not sell, trade or barter fish or fish parts including the eggs. Only the holder of a commercial fish licence or an aquaculture licence may sell fish roe.""  If Kijiji seller has these papers, it's basically moot. I'm sure the CO will determine these facts and if illegal, they should put out a news release to let others know their days are numbered."
738990,Christopheraaron,2012-10-23 13:08:00,3525,"It turns out my guy is from the states, I was looking at the toronto listings but I guess we're just too close to them."
738993,bigredfisher,2012-10-23 13:18:00,300,Lol
738995,Skipper D,2012-10-23 13:36:00,1970,"I would hope the MNR takes its time which it may and do a thurow investagtion to collect the names of the buyers as well and charge them also , you can see with out buyers as this is where the problem starts , there then would be no pochers and this way we might rid our selves of that problem all together , then good luck at doing that ."
739050,BillM,2012-10-23 17:54:00,17367," You're still assuming this guy harvested the fish illegally.    The MNR has bigger fish to fry then some guy selling roe on Kijiji, lol."
739052,bassman87,2012-10-23 18:00:00,586,is this an episode of criminal minds?
739156,Rich,2012-10-24 10:20:00,3927,"The problem starts with the buyers? Investigations? Its some salmon eggs, not a heroin smuggling ring. Lol i wonder if they'll bust the guys door down, toss flash grenades and point m16s in his face. And while a ridiculous amount of resources are being used to stop a guy selling his eggs, we can cry about a lack of CO's on the rivers."
739160,bushart,2012-10-24 10:57:00,2628,I am The Eggman.....They are the Eggmen....I am the Walrus....Coo Coo Ca Choo
739416,irishfield,2012-10-25 03:27:00,26272,Sorry... but I'm sure Crimestoppers has bigger fish to fry!
739433,bare foot wader,2012-10-25 04:24:00,1354,"hmm, CO's can't catch a break...there's never enough of them and when they do their job it's still not good enough  everybody complains about the roe slaughter-fests and the MNR is following up on a tip on illegal selling of roe...how is that a waste of time? or bigger fish to fry? it's a perfect example of the tips line working  hats off to bigredfisher for reporting it and hats off to the MNR for looking into it  most people harvest fish and roe for personal use or friends, but when you're advertising it online that's different...somebody selling roe online and giving the guy the leeway of assuming the fish was harvested legally...come on..."
739472,Rich,2012-10-25 12:17:00,3927,"Would be better if someone just caught him poaching the fish though. How many other fish did he give away before he got the genius plan to sell roe online? He must have a lot, to keep up with online demand. The point is, we need the co's on the water to stop this ridiculousness before it starts."
739487,SlowPoke,2012-10-25 12:42:00,2984,"There's a fine line between do-gooder and weasel. The cause may be better served by informing kijiji that it's illegal to sell roe. This would not only stop this egg wielding villain but others like him. Or, you could continue to dissect this unruly cartel limb by limb and boast about it online."
739496,cheaptackle,2012-10-25 13:05:00,849,There's a new ad on Kijiji saying they have roe from Ministry approved source.  Wonder how that's gonna turn out - could go either way!  Michael
739499,BillM,2012-10-25 13:13:00,17367,LOL!!!!   That's hilarious...  Ask to see their permit.
739501,Christopheraaron,2012-10-25 13:15:00,3525,"If it works out he's legal, $40 isn't bad for a pound."
739503,BillM,2012-10-25 13:17:00,17367, It is when you can go down to the cleaning stations in August and get pounds and pounds of it for absolutely nothing.
739506,woodenboater,2012-10-25 13:23:00,2277,"maybe from a farm ? but yeah, ask for his permit # and see if he antes up or clams up."
