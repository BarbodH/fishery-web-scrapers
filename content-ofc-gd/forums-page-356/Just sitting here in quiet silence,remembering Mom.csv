The wake and funeral are over, and Mom and Dad have been reunited. I reconnected with familly i haven't seen in years, and we all celibrated her life, the way she would have wanted us too, with love and fond memories. As i sat there and listened at the church, as her pastor talked about her love of life, and her love for friends and familly, a gentle breeze touched my face, and for an instant, i smelled her perfume.No one else noticed, but i did, and thats all that counts.  Thanks from my familly to you and yours.   Paul"

Sometimes in this fast pace of life we forget what we should cherish the most, and unfortunately, that realization often comes when its too late.

739397,mercman,2012-10-25 02:28:00,7054,"I lost my Mom about an hour ago. Well actually, i lost her in June when Dimentia began creeping between us. It crept into her mind quietly, but very very quickly.Robbing her of her of her memory, and ability to do what most of us take for granted.Think. Last Christmas she was weak, but still sharp as a tack, February we notice that she got confused easily,April she began forgeting things she did and said hours before, June she couldnt take care of herself.The Docs began to play with her Meds,trying to find the right combination to slow down her rapid deterioration, but were unable to do anything.She became chair bound and spent the next 4 months waiting for a long term care facility.Finally, last week she was transfered to her new home. She passed tonite quietly from an aparent heart attack.  So now i find myself parentless, and feeling kinda lost. When Dad passed, there was always Mom. Now they will both live forever in my memories.  In Loving memory  Emma Elsie Brule Douglas Robert White  I love you both dearly.Rest easy.  Your kids  Paul Douglas White Brian Robert White Janice Marlene White"
