739986,Joeytier,2012-10-27 20:55:00,3990,"Had a mini-splake bonanza last week in the canoe.  With low pressure and a stiff breeze I was hoping for an active spinner bite, and I definitely got it.  Fishing a long narrow finger bay off a good sized trout lake, we were able to intercept 10 nice splake.  Fish were easily patternable, with all but one fish coming off of large boudlers close to 10+ feet of water.  A couple points held multiple fish.  The 6 we took home were all between 10 and 16 inches, and had one fly out of my undersized brookie net that I would've pegged at 20+ inches.  I know this lake holds much bigger splake, as most of these fish were more than likely spring stockers from this year, so I was wondering if anyone had any tips for pattering for some bigger fish?  Multiple fish came off of that one boulder...   Tasty little buggers on my makeshift stringer...   Ready for action...fish were full of small panfish... "
