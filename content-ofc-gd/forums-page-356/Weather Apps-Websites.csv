One app will say 12 degrees and 8km winds, when another says 14 degrees and 15-20km winds. Gets kinda frustrating!  Just wanted to see what website/app others use that seems to be the most accurate for them.  Ones I use the most:  Websites - www.accuweather.com, theweathernetwork.com Apps - Accuweather and WindFinder"

740815,mistaredone,2012-10-30 17:45:00,913,I use the same three and its crazy how far apart each are?
740817,mike rousseau,2012-10-30 17:47:00,4661,This time of year I just prepare for the worst.... Then it can only be better then you planned for...lol
740819,ecmilley,2012-10-30 17:48:00,2163,wind guru is pretty decent on forecasting winds around the great lakes
740850,Nemo,2012-10-30 19:27:00,727,weatherspark.com on Chrome is pretty good.
740857,FishTracker,2012-10-30 19:46:00,47,I like the weather network.  Models change and so will what each source is saying.  I know it's just a probability.  I've accepted that
740938,ketchenany,2012-10-30 23:39:00,3229,"Weather network/weather eye. In use pincast, you can program any city and it will give you hourly forecast within a few km.  I tried at home and it worked great, it said rain and sure enough it wa raining! Short and  long term forecast."
740987,Sharkbait22,2012-10-31 01:38:00,297,Weatherspark is my latest preference but still using other sites and seeing how the weather actually turns out. Weatherspark is also limited in some Canadian locations. The Weather Network is reasonable. Government data used by commercial businesses offers a lot. Someone out there must have compared different providers to see who does it best.
