739821,tb4me,2012-10-27 00:42:00,3295,Cool and congrats..I didnt read this post untill after I heard it thru the grape vine...Thanks for posting!
739823,misfish,2012-10-27 00:45:00,29133,"  Are there like ,4-5 guys holding it?  if so,I have that some where here."
739840,Canuck2fan,2012-10-27 02:42:00,1444,Awesome catch!!! Amazing how strong they are. I got one about 3ft long this summer fishing overnight for perch on lake Erie. Definitely a blast on the 6lb line I was using.
739866,skeeter,2012-10-27 13:14:00,1907,Awesome awesome awesome !!!!!!  Thanks for sharing that with us.  Koodos to you for treating that fish the way  you did.  :thumbsup_anim:
739901,workwear,2012-10-27 15:31:00,592,nice truck!!!
739910,Jen,2012-10-27 16:11:00,833,"Amazing  catch for sure... and to have landed it so quickly.  I have a question, and do not laugh... no one, and that means you ... whoever you are with the grin on your face!  Never having caught a sturgeon I am wondering what it's skin feels like?  Is it soft and smooth like that of a channel cat or is it rough like the skin you would find on a shark or a sailfish?  They are a truly unique fish , so I just wondered if their skin was scales or if it was not?  No laughing!"
739913,workwear,2012-10-27 16:17:00,592,smooth and silky.....no scales
740210,ch312,2012-10-28 15:42:00,1590," YES! please post it if you can find it.    the headline was something along the lines of ""ok, where's the chips""  someone else caught a sturgeon in the same water and same area last week and got his picture in the paper. i'm assuming it's the same fish, but we'll never know. it would have been cool to get my pic in the paper with a sturgeon just like the old man did 20 years ago.   yep, but i did receive a couple cuts on my hand after tailing the fish and didn't realize until after that it was probably from those little nubs on the fish."
740216,Leecher,2012-10-28 16:04:00,7832,"Nice surprise for sure   Now just imagine hooking that same fish on ice, thru an 8"" hole    I experience this a few years ago in my hard water fishing debut and sturgeon was 49"" long and ice was 30"" thick    I have a pic somewhere, when I find it will post it TJunkie"
740221,misfish,2012-10-28 16:33:00,29133," I have been looking for it Scott,but my collection has been through both hands of my sons.   I remember it so clearly. Sorry I couldnt find it."
740235,mike rousseau,2012-10-28 17:21:00,4661,Must have been an awesome battle in skinny water like that... Nice catch...
740395,mercman,2012-10-29 02:54:00,7054,Awesome fish !! I would maybe not take a pic next time though.Endangered species and all. Still a very interesting catch on lite gear.
740397,Freshtrax,2012-10-29 03:01:00,2215,Nice fish.  I'd take a picture  you'd probably need to beach him anyways to get him to settle down to get the hook out.   I saw a school swim by the park in oakvilllle when a was about six that's the closest I have bin to one.
740428,Moosebunk,2012-10-29 08:36:00,3970," Smoother than fish scales, maybe not as smooth as a catfish though.  Rub the hand backwards on the fish it's a little leathery but overall smooth.  The scutes along the back can be razor sharp though.  Generally, the smaller the fish the sharper the scutes... they must get worn down in time or just dullen as they grow in size.  Best to tail them as far back on the tail as you can, and if it's a big fish grab right inside of the mouth too.  You can ""log roll"" from the water into your arms this way. lol.  You won't get under a gill plate easy or at all.  I've never eaten sturgeon... kinda wished I tried it up north as a good few people there do.  Had one girl in the ER have an allergic reaction specific to eating sturgeon, her father thought she may have got some ""belly meat"" off the fish.  Was there to see one filetted by a Native fella... because the fishes body has no bones, but instead just cartilage like a shark, the knife sliced through the meat and cartilage with ease."
740460,ch312,2012-10-29 13:13:00,1590," trust me, the fish was out of the water for less time than it took to type this sentence and was treated with the respect it deserved.  unfortunately the same can't be said for the other guy that caught what appears to be the same fish as the pic shows him holding the fish by  the gill plates for his pic   :wallbash:  :wallbash:"
740461,ch312,2012-10-29 13:15:00,1590," brian, thanks for looking. i'll go see the old man this week sometime to see if he can dig it up so i can post it for you guys."
735565,ch312,2012-10-10 13:20:00,1590,"i hit a lake erie trib yesterday for a few hours drifting roe and hooked into something decent. it didn't take long to see what was on the other end of the line and when i realized what it was i put the pressure on to get it beached and released.  the fish was out of the water for literally 5 seconds as i got lucky and it decided to stay calm for that part. i used my rod to measure the fish (when it was in the water) then measured the rod when i got home and it worked out to 45-48"". i still can't believe how strong a 4 ft fish could be.      "
735567,krixxer,2012-10-10 13:23:00,274,nice catch! according to the internet a 4 footer is around 12 years old.
735570,lew,2012-10-10 13:35:00,12766,Outstanding catch !!!!
735574,mistaredone,2012-10-10 13:52:00,913,Very cool'
735575,crappieperchhunter,2012-10-10 13:54:00,2582, X2   And thx for sharing with us.
735579,I'mHooked,2012-10-10 14:01:00,525,"Wow, awesome catch! Drifting roe I imagine you had a fairly light leader. How long did it take to land that guy?  As the wise old Yoda once said ""Impressive, most impressive"""
735581,NAW,2012-10-10 14:05:00,4022,Nice suprise for sure eh!  Thanks for posting the pics.  I wonder how big they get in Erie?
735585,ch312,2012-10-10 14:16:00,1590," i was using 12 lb power pro with a 8 lb mono leader, but i think i need to grab some flouro for a leader as i still haven't connected with a bow. at first i thought i snagged a stick that i could barely move with the light line, but the fish woke up as soon as it surfaced. i'd say it took 7-8 minutes to get it into the shallows where i ran over and tailed it as soon as i could. like i said, i just wanted to get it beached as soon as possible."
735587,Sinker,2012-10-10 14:20:00,8692,Thats awesome! Nice catch for sure! Must have been a nice surprise!!  S.
735588,fishnsled,2012-10-10 14:22:00,3520,Incredible surprise and nice catch!! Coo pics too.
735593,Rich,2012-10-10 14:36:00,3927,"Nice! Im surprised you dont hear about this a little more. I got one much smaller on an erie trib, bottom bouncing a roe bag when i was younger. And a few friends have had similar experiences, even in some very small creeks. Very cool."
735602,Christopheraaron,2012-10-10 15:05:00,3525,Very Cool! I guess the population is doing well!
735605,Moosebunk,2012-10-10 15:13:00,3970, Attaboy!!!  That's a big and tough fish to get in that quick actually.  It was surely no worse for wear.  The odd sturgeon is bound to happen into a hook now and again and nice to see ya showed this great and threatened fish from these parts some decency with a quick landing and release.  If that tug on the line didn't get your juices flowing for another eh!?!?  More 11+ footers caught out in the Fraser this year than in recent years.  Can you imagine?  Great fish!
735613,Musky or Specks,2012-10-10 15:52:00,2710,Very awesome
735627,Bondar,2012-10-10 17:10:00,817,"I've hooked about half a dozen on the lower Niagara , but I'm still yet to land one . They can really pull in the current down there . Nice surprise for sure"
735631,Rod Caster,2012-10-10 17:14:00,5784,very cool catch!!!
735639,GreenCanada,2012-10-10 17:41:00,375,what a brute for a Lake Erie trib! Great catch!
735640,i2cool2fool,2012-10-10 17:41:00,349,Walloping websnappers!
735749,Rizzo,2012-10-11 00:00:00,4754,"right on! I saw one on the upper niagara before, about the same size"
735750,dheitzner,2012-10-11 00:01:00,314,"Great fish man.  I actually caught one between 3 & 4' long in the Lower Niagara a few years ago.  Pretty exciting at the time, that's for sure."
735767,spinnerbaitking,2012-10-11 01:21:00,1622,"Very Cool, I've seen one jump in the Notty 15 or 20 years ago but that's as close as I've been to one Tight Lines SBK"
735781,northernpike56,2012-10-11 02:42:00,717,thats awesome!!!!!!!! congrats
735782,ehg,2012-10-11 02:46:00,2666,What an awesome fish.  Sounds like folks are seeing them all around the Great Lakes.  It is a Lake Sturgeon one caught in Georgian Bay weighed about 165 lbs. The max size might be over 7 feet and 200 lbs.  Great catch and photo!
735783,ch312,2012-10-11 02:59:00,1590, my dad landed a 120 pounder up there about 20 years ago and made the paper
735838,manitoubass2,2012-10-11 14:02:00,11391,"Thats a wicked catch!!!! Congrats, and good on you for treating that fish with respect!  I'm lucky enough to have crazy amounts of sturgeon in my homewaters. We can sit on te deck with coffee or beers and watch them jump all evening long. I even get to bring the kids down to the rapids so we can watch them spawn, which is incredible! 7ft fish so thick there piled on each other literally at your feet. Almost looks like a shallow, shark feeding frenzie!"
