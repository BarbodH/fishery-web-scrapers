739889,bh87ss,2012-10-27 14:19:00,33,"hey folks, I have a new to me 1800 fisherman with a EZ Load Bunk trailer, I want to put some load guides on the trailer and looking for some advice on the length of these.  Any current owners out there that have experience with these, should I be looking at the 2, 3 or 4 footers?  Thanks everyone"
739895,Fishing4Tails,2012-10-27 14:58:00,38,They should come just above your Gunnel of your boat ( boats edge above water line ) .. Plus easier for you to reverse into ramp  looking at your new load guides .  Maybe measure where you attach them to your trailers frame to the gunnel of your boat . .  Hope it helps
740122,captpierre,2012-10-28 01:47:00,2521,My Lund Tyee 17.5 trailer has them from the factory.  They are 2 ft long and come about half way up the side of the boat on the trailer
740125,DRIFTER_016,2012-10-28 02:06:00,10439,Same as captpierre here. About 2 1/2 feet long and 1/3 way up the side.
