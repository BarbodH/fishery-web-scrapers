739956,Joeytier,2012-10-27 19:11:00,3990,"Fished the lake a few weeks ago.  The Lodge is all of about 200 feet off the highway.  There tons of nice structure on the lake, but I'd take the time to explore other lakes in the area, personally.  I haven't stayed at the lodge btw.  They like to claim it's a private lake..."

I'll be back, as it's a very nice lake with great scenery, low traffic and good fishing structure. I'm sure someone with more experience could easily catch some nice walleye, pike and bass.  It is close to the hwy, so you'll be reminded that your not far off the path."

Great lake, not very big , very quiet, get to learn it you will catch fish  A good friend of mine has been up there a few times since the new owner renovated and says it is really nice, if thats the case it would be great place to spend some time.  Actually maybe I should make the trek once again..........but it needs muskie LOL"
