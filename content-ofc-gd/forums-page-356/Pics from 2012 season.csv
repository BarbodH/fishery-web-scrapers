740426,Moosebunk,2012-10-29 08:17:00,3970,Things I learned from Trev's picture report...  We have similar tastes in boats and fishing trips.  The guy fishes alot but generally his wife outfishes him.  He takes some wicked pics and probably likes beer.
740431,lew,2012-10-29 09:00:00,12766,Great season and even better pictures !!  Best one is the moose standing on the road.  Worst one was that damned snake in the water coming right at me
740435,fishindevil,2012-10-29 10:04:00,6254,"awesome season in review man !!! some great pics,and really nice fish too !!!"
740436,bobowski,2012-10-29 10:31:00,360,Awesome. Looks like you had a great 2012 fishing season. Its nice when you can spend time with the wife and be fishing at the same time.
740438,Skipper D,2012-10-29 10:54:00,1970,"29 replies 505 veiws you have to be pleased , and it was all about posting what you wanted to talk about after all . Thank you for sharing your awsome pictures and fishing times with us and we trust you'll be back to share more of your lifes events with us in the ner future"
740544,trevy727,2012-10-29 17:28:00,351," Another reason I married my wife. Not only does she love fishing, she was also a rangers fan before we met. Below are a couple pics of our spare bed room.   "
740545,trevy727,2012-10-29 17:34:00,351," All true except the wife out fishing me comment. We've been together for 10 years now. It's true that over that period of time she has caught more fish than me but for 9 out of 10 years I've caught the bigger fish. Last year she did catch more and bigger but this year I caught a couple 30lbers and her biggest was 22. Sometimes I think she's only with me for my spots! If I was to do it all over again, I would have put my spots in a prenuptial agreement."
740546,fishnsled,2012-10-29 17:39:00,3520, We certainly do appreciate them!       Love how you had a nice blend of fishing and truck pictures..... A great report and thank you for taking to the time to put it together.  Incredible adventures and fishing - awesome pics!
740308,trevy727,2012-10-28 23:26:00,351,"Thought I'd throw some pics together of my 2012 fishing season upto now. Got out in the boat over 45 times from April till now and as soon as my broken leg is healed, I'll be out again. My wife is my fishing partner. She has only missed a couple of those 45+ times. Below are some pics in no particular order. Actually, the first pics are from last winter, snorkeling in Mexico.                                                         This is only a few of the hundreds maybe thousands of pictures taken this year while fishing, camping or vacationing. After put these few together, I'm realizing that I'm a very lucky guy."
740311,Joeytier,2012-10-28 23:30:00,3990,Very nice.  Are those superior or Nipigon brookies?
740312,Rod Caster,2012-10-28 23:33:00,5784,"She's not afraid to catch bigger fish than you, is she? Haha. Lucky indeed, that is some sweet scenery you've witnessed this year."
740313,kickingfrog,2012-10-28 23:33:00,8333,That's a lot of fishin'.
