738642,Rattletrap2,2012-10-22 02:22:00,1652,"Thanks for sharing such a great report Wayne. Since I don't get out fishing much anymore, it is nice to relive the moments through your adventures. Best wishes for Jen as she conquers this next hurdle. Sure brought a smile to my face when I watched the video of her taking those steps! That tower was way more than I could handle. My hats off to her! Be well."
738644,irishfield,2012-10-22 02:42:00,26272,Thanks Brian.. John and Bert. Jen clearing hurdles is what keeps us going these days!

738718,mepps,2012-10-22 14:47:00,1301,Great stuff Irish!
740040,irishfield,2012-10-27 22:51:00,26272,Great to see you back in Ontario Clive! Thanks for checking in and reading our exploits.
740205,mistyriver1,2012-10-28 15:31:00,600,"Finally had some time to read your whole report Wayne.  Thanks for putting it together.  Love the shots of Maple Leaf gardens, you wouldn't even recognize it.  Beautiful pictures, looks like a great summer.  All the best to your family.  Jim"
736206,davey buoy,2012-10-13 12:16:00,5505,"Great looking trip!!!!!,Really enjoyed the read,and the pictures of course."
736263,irishfield,2012-10-13 19:35:00,26272," Probably a coincidence Drew.. same joiner I changed last year.. right where you loaded your sled!   I needed to fix it better anyhow!    Thanks MoS !    No need to be Jealous TH.. when it comes right down to it we're not there by choice each summer, but it's become a great retreat. The bass.. yes smallies... run in packs on this lake and you can see them coming for over 100 feet when it's calm. You can see down over 40 feet when anchored in the canoe. Hard part is getting your jig or spoon thru the 45 foot mark without getting one of these green carp.. before getting to the Lakers at 80 feet!    Glad things worked out somewhat for us Rick. Was rushed with my Niece showing up short notice, but we got each of your kids a Laker and you learned enough of the lake to enjoy your holiday. Your families Anniversary gift to us and the T shirt for Jen where above and beyond!    Just the way it is at the lake Brian.. just the way it is!    Well RC.. you can see in the group pic at the top it did the same to me! THANKS!    Steps where no fun.. but I think I did them right. They're not going anywhere. Would have been nice to be able to start at the bottom vs the top.. but I had to make sure the last step was level with the bottom of the steps to the deck. As for airplanes falling out of the sky.. Engine failure and if he had of missed the big tree he might have made the lake. Luckily for him he only caught it with the right wing... it turned the airplane around and they went backwards into the bush. So they were all forced back INTO their seats. Not a scratch on all three.."
736264,irishfield,2012-10-13 19:35:00,26272," No need to wait... come launch for free before our current ""great"" council gets the idea to start charging for launch/parking or access to the lake in general. I'm only 4 islands out from the highway.. always keen to be a guide or point you in the right direction.    Thanks Shaun!    Thanks JDS    Thanks Will... the pike living would have saved me a 1000 bucks tooooo !    Amazing what family death and illness can do to an otherwise separated family Phil. Like I keep saying.. life has an expiry date, don't lose site of that. We, as a family, spent too many years doing our own thing. A shame that at this point of life we've realized that was a huge mistake.    Thanks Hun!! Glad you enjoyed the pics since you have a greater idea of what we changed more than most here... since you've faught them steps yourself! lol    LOL Rich.. I'll shoot for 200 pics next summer. I actually had about 900 pictures from this summmer... but 300 were of the stairs!!    Yah.. they do look great Lex... don't you be chipping away at them with the shovel this winter!"
736286,mercman,2012-10-13 22:10:00,7054,"Wow !!!  I just now, had the time to finish looking at all the pics, and try to take in everything from this epic summer of yours. Thanks for allowing me into your world for spell.All the best to you and your familly Wayne. Especially Jen."

736316,irishfield,2012-10-14 01:16:00,26272, We're good bud.. it didn't cost me anything but a day of screwing around... and may very well have been caused by pulling the line out of the lake in the fall.
736321,TennesseeGuy,2012-10-14 01:45:00,957,Your family is making it happen.  Thanks for including us in your experiences.

736499,Skud,2012-10-15 02:18:00,739,Monster report. Good to see someone enjoying their summer. Great pics
736538,Harrison,2012-10-15 13:03:00,2202," Well said Wayne.  When the cards are down and money, assets, or status have absolutely no value anymore, what matters most are the folks holding your hand."

737189,Handlebarz,2012-10-17 01:31:00,3790,Dang now that was a summer of great memories. Not sure how I missed it the first round but glad it did not slip by this time.
737195,irishfield,2012-10-17 01:47:00,26272,Thanks Mike!! Did Danna tell you our cancer auction winner was a no show... not even a text to say she wasn't coming and she picked the date!
737197,camillj,2012-10-17 01:58:00,1988,Wow .. not sure how I missed this one .. lotta firsts this year Wayne and some KEEPER snaps ... love the 'buff-right-out' story !  I feel for ya on the stairs ... I did ours last summer so my 86 Yr Old Mother-in-Law could enjoy the docks/decks with us too ... but I got off easy ... mine was only 8 steps and the 63 wheel barrows of screening got dumped at the TOP of the hill for us  Congrats to Jenn for the milestone (and some fancy Moet-Mulroney) ... I have a strong sense that she'll be up there again next summer ... maybe even sippin on a 2000 Dom (which I just happen to have in the cellar   )
737720,irishfield,2012-10-18 19:40:00,26272,"Thanks Jon...we have to do what we do... when we need to do it! lol .. it's about as simple as that. Hopefully we get Jen's current battle behind us by spring, so we can do it all again next summer."
737926,mirogak,2012-10-19 13:23:00,387,Very nice - glad to see you and the family enjoying as best as possible.

738608,bicephalic,2012-10-22 00:30:00,112, Didn't hear you complaining while they were serving you fresh laker breakfast  Great report that's certainly become a mainstay of my early fall reading....and this time I got to be in it    Glad to see you guys managed another great summer!
738621,johnnyb,2012-10-22 01:27:00,3413,"Fantastic Wayne, as usual.  Rarely a dull moment, and certainly none that go unappreciated by you.  You guys really do it up right, and really have the right outlook. Was great to have breakfast with you...maybe a redo is in order this winter as part of an engine recovery mission"
736015,irishfield,2012-10-12 01:38:00,26272,"You take the low road.. and I'll take the high road.. and I'll (hopefully) get to camp long before you!! May 17th heading for the lake. Me in the air.. Leah pulling the boat.    Taxiing in behind the camp. Wind was too strong to turn towards the dock, so I had to go all the way around the island. I got tied up.. opened camp.. got the power on, started on the water, got the steel boat drained / cleaned / battery in / in the water and running. Played with the water for many more hours and finally had Leah there SEVEN hours after leaving home. She ran into every idiot she could doing 1/2 the speed limit. Water line.. someone appears to have cracked a fitting in the winter..    Visitors from Timmins the next morning. Two brothers, with one coming to pick up a windshield for his airplane. I brought it up in the back of my airplane to save him some travel / freight.    Saturday morning of the May 24 weekend. Flew into Kokoko Lake to meet up with Johnnyb, Bert and Brian. Arrived just in time for deep fried Laker breakfast and maple syrup! Left in a hurry after seeing the pink tongs! LMAO        Leah sent them a piece of tail to share! (Chocolate bunny rabbit). Just doesn't look right!    My older brother in an airplane with me for the first time since 1992! Amazing how two brothers, both pilots could manage that...      Sister in law's first flight with me.      Riggin shallow for Lakers in late May.      My stone work hasn't fallen off the wall yet!    My new fishing boat!      Jen was afraid she wouldn't be able to get into a boat. Our only fear was she wouldn't be safe going up the old ""rustic"" stairs. SO off to town with the barge for 12 x 12'long x 8"" x 8"" timbers to make 23 - 6' steps out of.                          Nothing keeps this one from fishing!    Kristal and I off to try out a new back lake on the topo map.        Spoiled.. and she knows it. $750 for a day trip on this lake with the local outfitter! Cost us about $36 in Avgas. True cost based on my flight hours this year for insurance/wear and tear/fuel... about $150.    Tranquility...    The beast from the depths. 44.5"" x 17 girth. Caught on a Fuji Film green spoon from Dave Mercer!    I caught it again about 25 minutes later on a bright orange Swim Wizz.    Then spent an hour and 45 minutes laying out the back of the Sportspal trying to revive it, but with no success.    We hit it over the head with a large rock and had lunch!      ""Earl"" .. ready for the taxidermist!    Next day we did some downrigging and picked up a few small Lakers.    The day after that... she wanted to hit another back lake. Another 5 gallons of fuel in a wing tank and we were hunting Lakers and catching bass... but I did get a couple of Lakers before heading home.    Nope, that's not bass! Nice tasty Laker!      Yah.. I know.. enough pictures of the stairs already. Almost every day I worked on these it went beyond 30C. It took a day a step when it came right down to it. Start to completion.. 23 days.    Stopped in to see a customer, now good friend, down the South end of the Lake. Made use of his new boat lift...    .. he has a great view of Wingfoot Island, what use to be Goodyear Canada's executive retreat.      Three weeks of steady work finally finish the stairs. I think we're owed a back lake outing after lugging over 80 x 5 gallon buckets of stone from a local quarry. Fill and load into the truck.. then out of the truck and into the boat.. out of the boat and up the hill !      My favourite lake. It's like an aquarium.            Canada Day.  "
736016,irishfield,2012-10-12 01:40:00,26272,"107 miles West of Temagami... NW of Sudbury at Leah's cousins camp.                Leah's cousin's kid. His first ever time leaving the ground !    This is going to be my new business card background ""Gone fishing... try calling again tomorrow!""    Cousin's husband.. same deal, never in an airplane.    We fished for two days over Sudbury way. Gorgeous spot and gave thoughts to moving West ourselves. Only 12 camps on a 12 mile long lake! We caught some dink pike and a few little lakers. Leah lost a beast of a pike in a back bay, but she was afraid it was going to snap her new Spiel special so broke the line with her finger against it and the reel seat.  Back on Temagami... Carol with a nice little Laker. Her first ever!    A day trip to Temagami's version of Wasaga Beach (without the T shirt shops and bars).      Some more rare Temagami Mermaids. These one's learned you sink when you reach up to the dock edge for your drink!    If you're bringing food... you'd better bring your own fridge! (stocked in anticipation of Jen, Steph, my brother and his wifes arrival for the fire tower challenge climb)    Jen, and her physiotherapist, officially opening her staircase!    As far as we know, and according to her surgeon, Jen is the first person in the world to walk, without a mechanical aid, after ""limb salvage surgery"".  <iframe width=""560"" height=""315"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/qhktf25ukqY?list=UUX20ioQYlHVcFj7Y40AGLIQ&hl=en_US"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>          You'll have a hard time believing that she has absolutely no mechanical connection to her right leg.

The last of 7 that my brother was presented for picking up brand new Airbus A320's and A330's in France during his time as crew captain for Skyservice. That last bottle was supposed to be for his son's wedding.. but oh well some things are more important! OH.. and YES.. we know we broke the law before someone points that out. We don't care...          Jen and my brother Murray. He had challenged her to climb the tower POST surgery and she did so a year and a week later!              Back in her element. Jen was on the varsity rowing team at Ryerson. She'd be hard to beat in a skull now.. with a LOT more upper body strength after a full year on crutches and 9 months of strength building at physio.      After Jen's July 17th oncologist check up... we were lucky enough to get a sneak peek at the new Maple Leaf Gardens... before that Stephen Harper dude even! (Jen's the rec administrator at Ryerson) Seems really odd to be standing on cement at the same level that we use to sit in Dupont Plastics private booth.. that was way up in the rafters!    This is the 4th floor of the Gardens now. The last 12 seats from a row of reds is still mounted to the wall across from Jen's office on the SECOND floor!    Brother and wife, with brothers best friends Sarah and John from England. John was my brothers Hercules navigator during the Gulf War.    John and I for a flight. His first in a small airplane as well. A lot of firsts this year.    G-man !    Spincast and his daughter.    B with a nice little Laker.    G-man with a nice eater !    G-man modelling his new hat! (hoping it will grow into a boat!)    My niece and newest great niece arrive for 4 days.    An imaginary airplane ride for the girls. We were in Florida one minute and Sault St Marie the next!    Great niece learning to drive the boat. NEVER too young!      275 about describes these little ones. Hard for an old guy to keep up with I'll tell ya!      Spincast and his family were going by, so I waved them in for a drink before they headed home the next day. I had found Rick a nice place to rent about 3 islands up the lake from us.    Our 30th Anniversary! How many here would get away with a simple fishing trip to fill the day?? !!          It's not the size of the fish... it's the company you keep on the trip!    I think she's smiling because I made supper... either that or the Champagne!      Would you hurry up and cook me a hamburger!! I'm getting hungry here....        The one and only Joey!! Leah and I slipped down to Lakair on, I believe, the 6th of August.  "
736017,irishfield,2012-10-12 01:40:00,26272,"Leah and Tybo    Roy, Leah and Roy's wife J.    Daplumma.. aka Joe!    Aplumma.. aka Art, just after molesting hugging Leah.    Leah and Roy's son Phil.    Joe with supper!    Roy's keeping my sister's Jimmy in MINT condition. So nice to see that it found a great home!    The one and only Roy!    Joey and Leah hamming it up..    Joe and Leah as we slip into ""nighttime"". If you like the movie Air America.. you'd understand that!    Thank God we only went to Lakair for ONE night! LOL    Beaver every morning never gets old!      Off to try another lake this time. Kristal and the canoe first.    Dropped her and the boat and headed back to get her boyfriend.    BF's first ever flight in an airplane.    Paddling out to meet us.    Both out.. and I'm gone. Double round robin for pick up scheduled for 6 hours later.    That'll buff right out....    This guy was lucky... I did a 10 minute detour coming back with Kristal on the pick up and about 7 minutes shy of my dock and shut down I picked up a weak radio call ""we've crashed in the bush.. East side of Kokoko Lake"". They would have spent the night at minimum in the bush if I hadn't picked up that call, but thanks to Kristal and I texting/flying and a lot of horseshoes aligning, we had Lakelands Beaver in the air and myself refueled and back in the air within 15 minutes. Total time in the bush for 3 soles was 34 minutes!! Trenton SnR thanked us for the quickest recovery in their history, and they didn't even need to fire up a bird!          A new species in the boat... leave it to the chief fisherperson in the family!      And what we were really after... well Pickeral really, but this thing tugged!    1000 Gallons US thru the Verado. A milestone that I'm on one hand glad about.. but the wallet not so much!    Old man winter keeps trying to wreck my dock cribs.    Amazing what you can get done for a few gummy bears!    Finally got him to lip a bass! Another one on the way...    Leah and her sister.    Tell me these guys (our nephews) aren't having fun!        Jen diagnosed with a Ewing's Sarcoma tumour on her skull and we get this out of the fridge the same day. Hoping it was the $40,000 trip for four. No such luck.. a lousy T shirt. Oh well, better than nothing.     Home from the lake at least a month early to get Jen into specialists and get her next battle going. Was a GREAT summer while it lasted with only 6 days that didn't make it to 20C. Most were 27 or above... with the fireban making it all the way to the August long weekend."

You did every you could by the sounds of it and who would have guessed it would have hit twice.

736132,irishfield,2012-10-12 21:50:00,26272,  I'll have to fly up and show you how to split the stones. I'll do one and then leave you to it while I go fish your lake!
