739556,ckrb2007,2012-10-25 16:31:00,449,"Any portable hut is a pain in the rear to pull by hand through the snow/slush. Sure, the ""clam"" type huts are a bit heavy to pull by hand..... but if you are going to get a pop-up style hut you need to factor in the hut, sled, chair and gear. Yes, it a pop-up may be a little lighter but for the ease of set up in windy conditions you'd be better off getting the ""clam"" style. The trick with pulling a hut by hand is a super long rope....... I'm talkin' 20ft long. Makes a HUGE dfference. If you're looking for a one man hut. Take a look at the Frabill Commando. Tons of space in it and super dark inside."
739563,BucktownAngler,2012-10-25 17:00:00,582," not too difficult to setup a popup in the wind.  - line it up with 1 side facing the wind - anchor all corners down - pop out the side facing the wind, and tie it down to the anchor - then pop out the other sides, tie them down and youre good to go  Its easier with 2 guys, but can be done solo"

739834,Stoty,2012-10-27 01:43:00,2910," No problem at all. I haul mine alone all the time on foot. Just make sure you put runners on it.... I have mine rigged up to be able to remove the extra seat if I'm fishing alone, that takes out some weight and creates a TON of room inside the hut for storage as well."
739841,moxie,2012-10-27 02:52:00,1566,"I picked up a used Shappell Rover 1.5 DLX locally for $120 last season. Not the sturdiest of shelters but it weighs in at 53lbs(Dry), set up is reasonably easy, stores all my gear, bench seat offers enough room for an adult w/child, and I could stuff it into the trunk of a hatchback. I usually get out on the ice maybe a dozen times a season, if I'm lucky and drag it around by hand when I do. There are many factors in determining what type best suits your needs. Make a list of your wants and needs and keep your eyes peeled for a used deal. Huts that sport a Fishy smell are good bets....... or not. Good luck."
740274,jerdog,2012-10-28 19:25:00,39,"I love my Otter for certain purposes such as when fishing with a friend or when I'm going to be set up with the heat on with very little moving around.  It's a bit big for pulling unless the ice is snow-free or hard packed.  They are really meant to be towed.  Good heavy frame, deep tub, lots of space, rugged cover... I'd consider getting the bench seat over the swivel chairs if weight isn't an issue.  When I'm fishing alone I usually only take one seat to keep the weight down to a minimum.  I bought it with an eye to having lots of space on spots within a short walk.  I want to get a smaller one-man for some run and gun fishing when I know I'm not going to take the time to set up a heater - just flip and fish."
740277,Sinker,2012-10-28 19:42:00,8692," Ya, sure. No problem at all. Those runners really make a difference in a foot of snow, eh?  Maybe on glare ice, and no snow, with nothing in it.  If your planning on hauling that thing a couple miles, full of gear, with any amount of snow on the ice, have fun!! Been there, done that.  A one man flip over is the way to go IMO. I've had both. Started with a one man flip, found it small, moved up to a two man flip, found it too much work to haul around by hand, now have a fish trap guide. Best set up for me. I can haul it around in snow, on long hauls, and I even take it in to back lakes where I have to break trail with snowshoes.   The other way is to go with a pop up. They are great once they are set up, but if you have to move, they suck. I like the portability of the one man flip. All my gear stays right in the sled, I just flip it and go. Takes literally 3 seconds and your gone.  I put runners on mine(they do nothing in deep snow, but protect the sled when there is no snow), and I recommend the travel cover too.  There are lots of new portables on the market now, a lot that I don't even know about. I'm just giving you my view, from my experience. I spend a lot of days on the hardwater, on foot, hauling gear around, and this set up works the best for ME.  S."

740562,Acountdeleted,2012-10-29 19:09:00,2562,I think the one I was looking at last year on sale at bass pro was the Frabill excursion. It looked real nice and the 2 captains chairs looked super comfy. Has anyone had any experiance?  That being said limeyangler's 3 man looks amazing. How many pennies do I need to save for one of those?
739177,LucG,2012-10-24 13:54:00,779,"Hey guys, I'm searching for a portable ice shelter and was looking for some advice from others.  I am after a two man shelter that folds into a sleigh, preferably with two built in seats. I’ve looked at Clams, Frabills, Otters and multiple other brands, but am unsure which to go with. I was looking at spending approx. $400-500.  I had almost decided on the Clam Fish Trap - Nanook at $339 but then read multiple negative reviews regarding the fabric tearing, poor hardware, weak poles etc..  The next model up is the Clam Fish Trap - Yukon at $449  I'm basically looking for something durable, built to last, and fairly light. It needs to be easily put up as well as taken down. I figured I'd come ask the folk who know best. So if any of you have purchased something similar, please give me your thoughts and/or suggestions.  Thanks in advance."
739184,Rod Caster,2012-10-24 14:09:00,5784,"If we buy two at the same time maybe we'll get a discount? I'm looking for the exact same thing. I found wholesalesports had some good deals but shipping and returning faulty products was a concern. Hopefuly you get some good advice here, as I'll be watching closely."
739186,LucG,2012-10-24 14:14:00,779,"That might be something I would seriously consider. But I too am leery about purchasing something online that I am not 100% confiend in. Thus my post here. Its hard enough to decide on a specific brand, let alone the many different models within. We'll keep in touch, let me know if you come accross anything, and I'll do the same."
739194,ckrb2007,2012-10-24 14:45:00,449,See if you can find an older Fish Trap Guide in good condition. Kijiji is a great place to look for these and you can usually find one cheap.
739199,trapshooter,2012-10-24 15:14:00,1234,After completely destroying a fish trap guide in 2 seasons (towing behind snowmobile) I swore off Clam forever.  After 1 season with an Otter Ice Cabin I'm more than happy with it.  Everything is more durable.  Just my 2 cents.
739201,LucG,2012-10-24 15:16:00,779, Thanks I'll look into it.  Is there something specific about this older model that you liked?
739202,12footspringbok,2012-10-24 15:17:00,459, X2  Put my otter through hell and back the past few winters. Everything is more durable on them. Worth the extra cash for sure.

739206,cityfisher,2012-10-24 15:30:00,959,had an old guide that got killed by the snow and ice..  I now got Clams popup hut and a heavey duty sled... Love the setup:)
739208,BucktownAngler,2012-10-24 15:36:00,582, did you have runners installed on your fish trap guide?
739212,ckrb2007,2012-10-24 15:45:00,449,"I've had my Guide for 5 seasons now....bought it used and towed it behind my sled and quad, full of gear, on Lake Simcoe 4-5 times a week during the season. Still going strong. Just the odd ""mouse hole"". The tub has no holes. I've always used downhill skis on the bottom as runners. I do go thru a few sets of skis per season though."
739214,ckrb2007,2012-10-24 15:52:00,449,I really like the seats and the fabric of the older models. Way more durable then the newer models.
739216,trapshooter,2012-10-24 15:58:00,1234," Oh yeah, I blew through a set of runners per season.  As the second set of runners was wearing down that's when the hole/tear/crack in the sleigh started to open up.  Cheap plastic.  That was the worst part of the design... the shallow sleigh with thin/weak plastic.  IMO, Compared to the Otter products the Clams are like kids toys."
739218,Fisherman,2012-10-24 16:04:00,7201," I'll vouch for 12foot's treatment of the double Otter he adopted from me, he beats it..mercilessly.  I have the smaller version, you get what you pay for.  I had a Frabill once, it lasted one outing... garbage."
739235,Live2fish85,2012-10-24 17:01:00,1633,My cousin had clam pop up that broke the first outing. When we put it up the one knuckle thing that the poles sit in just broke in half.
739246,LucG,2012-10-24 17:28:00,779,"Thanks for all the advice guys. Before I began my research, I had though for sure Clam built quality products, but with many negative reviews, I'm starting to think not.  Does any one have any good pics of their portables? Inside and out?"
739265,Jds63,2012-10-24 18:50:00,1365,"The Otter stuff does look Heavy Duty, I have the Clam base camp , it works fine and have had no problems in 2 winters of use. If i get a portable hut for pulling, the Otter may be the way to go. They are pricey though."
739326,phatpelkey,2012-10-24 22:40:00,78,"5-6 years ago i got a guide, i freaking loved it , but found it to small for 2 adults so i sold it and bought a new clam yukon 2 years ago, and i hate it (compared to the older guide), quality isnt there no more, wish i woulda keep my smaller 2 man or got a frabill or otter, oh well i guess you live and you learn!!"

Sure enough a buddy of mine bought one and the bar of the seat post in 2 weeks wore right through the sled from all of the bouncing around that the seat did. He is now looking for a new portable.

739360,Stoty,2012-10-24 23:55:00,2910,"I have used almost every model of Clam shelter out there, and I have to admit that the Nanook is my fav and the only hut I still use to this day.

Good seats. Lots of room for 2 and all my ""Stuff""  I started with the Clam runners but they did not last 1 year, I then went to downhill skis and they made it thru 2 years  I now have some HUMV plastic and I have 2 years and will likely get 3 on this set up      Rick"
739429,limeyangler,2012-10-25 04:07:00,5204,  Yup.....try this link to a post i did when i got my Otter 3 years ago.  MY OTTER OUTDOORS 3 MAN FLIP UP SHELTER   Although the material seemed flimsier than the Top of the line Frabil at the time it had more leg room out front. I went for the bench seat because my wife was expecting and i thought the bench would be better set up for small kid.  I chose the Otter because the sled part of it was just way sturdier and deeper.
739474,LucG,2012-10-25 12:19:00,779," Are most of the two man shelters light enough to haul by hand? The reason I am buying one is to bring with me to all my small back lakes, most often walking through a narrow winding trail through the bush. But I'm starting to get the feeling they might be too big/heavy. Am I better off getting a popup shelter without the sleigh/seats?"
739475,LucG,2012-10-25 12:20:00,779," Thanks, Looks very roomy, but definitly not one I'd like to haul by hand."
739507,Rod Caster,2012-10-25 13:26:00,5784,"Luc, take a look a this thread I started last year  http://ontariofishin...=1entry669811   Most of the pop-up/sleigh type shelters online either come in 1 or 3 man design. The 3 man's are typically near or over 100lbs, while any available 2 man's are around 90-95. 100lbs is way too much for me to haul around, plus additional gear on back lakes. These type of shelters are mostly for guys with sleds or four-wheelers I'd say....unless someone here can vouch otherwise.  I'll probably just look into a tent-style unit and purchase a separate hand-sleigh to pull all my gear. They are much cheaper too (around 150-300) and some of the online distributers have really good sale pricing.  Here are some other links. http://www.lebaron.c...am_shelters.pdf  At 18lbs the eskimo looks like a nice unit http://www.lebaron.c...ll12/eskimo.pdf  Here are a couple Pelican sleds. I have a similar one from CT. http://www.lebaron.ca/pdf_files_fall12/bluefox_pelican.pdf"
