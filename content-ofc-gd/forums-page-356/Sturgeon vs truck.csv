740082,Twocoda,2012-10-28 00:01:00,4130,This thread is kinda like an episode of Seinfeld...much to do about nothing....but yet i read the whole thing and very seldom ever watched Jerry's show ...i was always more of a get out and get some air kinda guy..so TV really wasnt on the priority list of things to do ...but maybe i would have been better off if i did watch TV back then..who knows ...might have saved a few relationships if i was home more...worst case scenario would have been an early grave or locked up in a loonie bin...oh well...life goes on ....try to enjoy it...
740138,mike rousseau,2012-10-28 02:56:00,4661,At least this guy didn't get reamed for taking a picture of a closed year round fish... Love double standards on this board.....
740139,Spiel,2012-10-28 03:00:00,9065, No one is forcing you to stay.
740140,Cudz,2012-10-28 03:03:00,2652,"Broken legs suck!! I hope you heal up soon bro!! I love fishing, cars (and trucks), football, and eating.  I am willing to read threads about all of the above. I love a few other things too."

740149,Jen,2012-10-28 05:49:00,833,"Oh Trevy' my dear man,  It is very hard to post anything that would come even close to as beautiful or articulate as one of Moosebunks posts.  I still always say, well done, and read each and everyone of his stories with the utmost respect.  In regards to many fishing outings, I am often left without words because I am in awe of the great fisher men and women that come to this site to share.  However in saying that , on occation, I am inspired to say more.  The words find me and I can type more than ""well done"" or ""great pictures"" or 'thanks for sharing""... This place doesn't judge me for the length of my posts or the content of them, this place only accepts me for who I am.  Once you realize that everyone here is equal and feel, truly feel, you FIT, you will , or shall I say won't think there is any difference between you or another guy... by the way ...What do you drive, where do you fish and when?  Been great today having this to look forward to come back to...  Thanks for the smiles!"
740155,trevy727,2012-10-28 12:42:00,351,"  Hey, I actually know a guy named 'Ed Zachery'! No lie!"
740204,BucktownAngler,2012-10-28 15:29:00,582,"sub forums would be nice.  general NF discussion gereral fishing discussion fishing reports etc.  those who want to read certain post can chose to do, and not have to sift throught the others first.  i however enjoy all types of posts. (except the what are you listening to post) lol"
740214,kickingfrog,2012-10-28 15:52:00,8333,"Personally I don't like sub forums and as such I almost always access the OFC under ""view new content"", I get everything and then just pick and chose what I want to read/respond."
740304,SirCranksalot,2012-10-28 22:31:00,3291,Nice topic for a rainy afternoon when the fish aren't biting.   mmmmmmmmmmmmmmm-------ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ.
740332,aplumma,2012-10-29 00:24:00,6896, We have found that if we leave the choice of what to read to the members under one header they miss fewer posts that they want to read.  Art
740336,Fisherman,2012-10-29 00:40:00,7201,I just bet Lews boat is jealous he spent so much money on a new truck.
740422,EC1,2012-10-29 05:23:00,930,"I am gonna apologize that I didn't read 2 pages of this... But I'll explain why I, personally Read OFC. I'll admit that I barely read any newspapers, and am not super updated with current events. I find that you will learn a lot of insights into life and street smarts just from reading here(Some Fishing and some NF, of course).... Well if you keep up and read most of the posts."
740424,Moosebunk,2012-10-29 08:06:00,3970,"Will tell this...  After a good few years here, there and just about everwhere online... EACH person's involvement, contributions, participation and reasons for being at, or belonging to, are a very ""personal"" thing.  The people are oftentimes as different as night and day, things don't always make sense, the flow cannot be controlled or even bent by will (unless by the hands of Mods) and, ""most times"" you've just gotta be the one to remember to try and keep it light and be polite.  Pretty simple but not... lol.   I'm here too because I love to fish.  Seems there are others here in that same boat!"
739920,woodenboater,2012-10-27 16:34:00,2277,spot on post Jen !
739927,d_paluch,2012-10-27 16:49:00,343," but what if that car, or in my case 05 Mazda3, is what get's me to and from fishing spots? got a problem with cars?         "
739941,jedimaster,2012-10-27 17:24:00,3472,I thought this was a guy using a truck to catch a sturgeon

739947,Twocoda,2012-10-27 18:10:00,4130,i only come here because they havent banned me  Well written Jen! I couldnt have said it better myself...if if i was as articulate as you
739951,fishnsled,2012-10-27 18:44:00,3520,"30 Replies and 649 Views in 6 hours.....good topic!     Jen nailed, plain and simple. It's not all about the fishing, it's about the community. Weather someone has a banner day on the water, buys a new truck, need help with a problem of some kind, or has lost a loved one, you will find it here and with that the support of community. It is what makes this place what it is.   "
739952,misfish,2012-10-27 18:47:00,29133," And don,t forget about all the new friends that have been made here.  That in it,s self,is a big bonus."
739954,fishnsled,2012-10-27 18:52:00,3520, Absolutely!! Many fishing trips would not have happened if it wasn't for the great people I've met here over the years.
739969,trevy727,2012-10-27 20:07:00,351,Okay I understand now. Post a topic with pictures of a few fish of a lifetime and you get a handful of replies from the true fishermen who can appreciate what it is. Post some nonsense jibber jabber and everyone throws in their 2 cents. Should be called OCN
739970,misfish,2012-10-27 20:12:00,29133,"  LOL  You can always start your own site and make it fishing related only.Ban members that post anything but.   Then again,you are here,so,whats the prob?  Don,t like it,well then,,,,,,,,,,,,,,LEAVE. Pretty simple.   Thank you Jen."
739972,lew,2012-10-27 20:19:00,12766,"Maybe I shouldn't have bought a new truck,  woulda saved alot of squabbling."
739973,Terry,2012-10-27 20:23:00,14456,"the beauty is  there are lots of other websites out there, so everyone can find a match or 2 that suits them  and no one is forced to stay here or forced to read the non-fishing posts sounds like you will be on the move, cause this site will not be changing any time soon  but feel free to drop in when you want info on a new pick up"

739993,trevy727,2012-10-27 21:03:00,351,My first topic to ever get over 15 replies. And by far the worst. Thanks everyone
739994,irishfield,2012-10-27 21:04:00,26272,  I've got a million things to do and ticking them off one at a time as the schedule allows... Lew bought himself a mightly fine new truck and CH pulled a fish out of the drink that many NEVER will! Both good to see !
740000,Skipper D,2012-10-27 21:14:00,1970,Come on in Trevy727 and take your hat off and become one of the family and you'll never have to be bored again ...... trust us .

740005,davey buoy,2012-10-27 21:18:00,5505,"If this place wasn't so much darn fun,I might get bored too:P."
740010,trevy727,2012-10-27 21:36:00,351,"  I agree about this forum bringing together an amazing group of people and I do only post to threads that I feel like posting to. I enjoy reading most posts every few days or so.  I just think its a shame that on a 'fishing forum' a guy like Moosebunk puts a report together that could have taken a couple hours, and another guy catches a sturgeon! And myself post pictures of some Brook trout that many people will never see in their lives and only receive 15 replies?  Then one of the posse posts about having fish for dinner and he gets 150 replies. It's not a big deal, just seems clique.  I for one don't put the effort into posts simply because it seems like no one really cares unless you've been around here for ever.  I'm definitely not implying anything negative towards everyone on this forum. I have met a few people and purchased some things from people who are top shelf guys. I just think, if you have time to post 4-6 posts/ day, you should probably say 'hey, nice catch' to those special reports that have something out of the ordinary."
740011,kuhaman,2012-10-27 21:36:00,503,You spelled Toyota wrong LOL

740016,Billy Bob,2012-10-27 21:45:00,5865,I have caught THOUSANDS of fish...And MANY were very large...  I have only owned a handful of trucks..........
739856,trevy727,2012-10-27 12:24:00,351,Is this really a fishing forum? A guy catches a 4' sturgeon and gets 27 replies in 3 weeks. Another guy buys a new truck and gets 70 replies in 2 days? Huh?
739857,Phil 65,2012-10-27 12:37:00,37,
739858,wkrp,2012-10-27 12:41:00,656,You are walking clockwise my friend. Be careful.
739861,gaspumper,2012-10-27 12:51:00,393,It's what you call an old boys site.
739863,Terry,2012-10-27 12:56:00,14456,"well my mommy always said, if you have nothing nice to say keep your mouth shut  so, I thought that sturgeon was closed year round and on the endangered species list and the new governing body said..no catch and release fishing for them , no taking them out of the water for a photo so I decided not to comment on it, to be polite ..I didnt post on the thread about the guy culling the truck after he reach his possession limit of trucks either..lol"
739864,glen,2012-10-27 12:59:00,2641,Nice truck eh?
739867,trevy727,2012-10-27 13:14:00,351,"  Ok, so maybe the sturgeon is a bad example. What about the awesome bass post by Moose who only has 16 replies? And was posted 3 days before?"
739869,trevy727,2012-10-27 13:15:00,351,  It's definitately a very nice truck
739871,lew,2012-10-27 13:26:00,12766,Maybe more guys like looking at nice new trucks than ugly old sturgeons
739873,trevy727,2012-10-27 13:31:00,351,"I guess what I'm really trying to say is that I think there are a bunch of stuck up people around here that sit around and look at this site all day, every day and get their 4-6 posts on per day and can't even say 'hey, great FISHING report' to the guys that spend who knows how long to put their stories and pics up. I understand that lots of you people are friends but it is a fishing forum/ community and personally, I don't post many pics or reports because frankly, I don't think people care about them as much as their friends getting a new truck or what their friend is eating for dinner or so on and so on."
739879,d_paluch,2012-10-27 13:45:00,343,"I am impartial. I  understand that it is a fishing forum, but the people who have been on here longer have become good friends, whether it be in person or online, and I get that. To be honest  I am more upset about this thread title  I wanted to see a sturgeon vs a truck..."
739880,Christopheraaron,2012-10-27 13:49:00,3525, Sturgeon would win.
739882,Spiel,2012-10-27 13:59:00,9065,"If your new truck is taking you and your boat fishing, I'd think it fishing related."
739884,Skipper D,2012-10-27 13:59:00,1970,"I can't see where any one could sit and talk fishing 24/7 with any one person , hec wouldn't that become boring pretty fast , if for example you could do that wouldn't that make you one of the old boys in the old boys club .............."
739893,woodenboater,2012-10-27 14:37:00,2277,or people are more likely to be getting a new ride vs hitting a sturgeon   Both of which would be cool in my books (truck more so ha ha).
739898,kickingfrog,2012-10-27 15:14:00,8333,"Nice truck.  Nice fish.  Quality responses? Nope.   Many of us are likely to be in the market for a vehicle but considering there are very few areas that we can legally target sturgeon…   It's ok if someone doesn't get the ""community"" part of OFC."

739908,Jen,2012-10-27 16:02:00,833,"I can't resist...  This is  mostly a male oriented forum... and from what I have been able to gather in information about the general man... he doesn't say a whole lot.  He will say, nice truck, nice fish, great post... and so forth.   However we all know there are exceptions to this rule and some very articulate writers here.  This forum brings together a lot of amazing people from all walks of life, who put their vast knowledge and information in one place. It also gives people a place to go, to gather, and share when they are not out on their boats or  on the shore beside someone fishing or meeting for coffee.  All of these things are very important to all of us and the foundation of what has made this site as popular as it is.  Rather than judge and comment on the quality, content or quantity of posts how about you just post to the ones that you personally enjoy and  slide past the rest when they irk you?  I do not think anyone's intention is to make this place feel like an old boys club.  The name of the site is Ontario Fishing Community .  If you define that I am sure you will have an answer to your Question!  There are hundreds, thousands even of posts that give examples of what this place is... for me it is more than just a fishing site... but then maybe I am bias, or just a girl or just a fisherman or a friend or one of the strangers that wanders here from time to time.  Either way, your post made me remember why it is I come here and I think that was a great thing ... so thank you!"
739911,i2cool2fool,2012-10-27 16:14:00,349,Thank you Jen. Your words also reminds me why I end up here occasionally and sometimes contribute.
739912,kickingfrog,2012-10-27 16:16:00,8333, Nice post.
739914,davey buoy,2012-10-27 16:20:00,5505,"The variety of topics is what,IMO,makes this site better than others. I also agree without a truck or car,pretty hard to get to your fishing spot.(fishing related for sure). lol."
739915,TroutnMuskieHunter,2012-10-27 16:20:00,1362, Me as well....Thanks Jen!
739916,mikeseb,2012-10-27 16:20:00,201,"trucks are a part of most peoples (including me) fishing gear, they tow boats, haul gear, get you to more remote spots and for me it is also my mobile tackle box (tool box in the bed is FULL of steelhead gear lol),  so a truck post is IMO a fishing related topic, if someone were to post about their 91 hatch back civic now that would be a different story haha  edit: nice truck though, to bad she aint a gm"
