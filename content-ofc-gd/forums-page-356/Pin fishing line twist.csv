740597,misfish,2012-10-29 21:22:00,29133, Just need to get out with some vets of the pin. Pretty much self taught right now.  Be nice to hook up with you sometime.
740600,rhare,2012-10-29 21:39:00,387,  Sounds like a plan we will have to set something up once this chocolate milk clears
740602,misfish,2012-10-29 21:44:00,29133," Maybe by the time I come back from the deer hunt,It will be fishable.  I,ll be in touch."
740634,BillM,2012-10-29 23:47:00,17367, Challenge accepted.  
740719,rhare,2012-10-30 10:45:00,387,"   LOL Bill     sounds good, I'm in ..  Dan might be better competition his wallis casting is pretty sick. At the very least it will give us a reason for another get together LOL."
740738,BillM,2012-10-30 11:56:00,17367," Absolutely man, we can lose a bunch of floats on the Notty trying to one up each other, lol!!!  You've got my number, gimme a ring when you and Dan want to get out."
740047,BillM,2012-10-27 23:16:00,17367," I run 2 swivels in my rig.  Nanofil to swivel to shot line to swivel to leader.  I haven't lost a float in a loooong time with this setup..  Unless there is a nick in my mainline, the leader/shot line always pops first."
740072,misfish,2012-10-27 23:45:00,29133, So where is the float?
740081,DundasSteelheader,2012-10-28 00:01:00,166," Just curious, how do you attach your leader to your mainline then? Something like a double uni?"
740088,Twocoda,2012-10-28 00:17:00,4130, In between the two swivels..and that section carries 90 % of your shot for getting you down..that way when you break off your leader you dont have to reshot
740091,Twocoda,2012-10-28 00:20:00,4130, Old School method was to use straight 8 or straight 6...but then someone invented colourful line
740121,spinnerdoc,2012-10-28 01:46:00,556,"I run one swivel on my rigs, and it's a tiny one above the float, I usually predetermine the length from the swivel to the top shot so it gives me room to move the float if i wanna adjust my target depth"
740162,Sharkbait22,2012-10-28 13:11:00,297,One decent micro swivel above the hook and below the shot. Mod-Wallis cast 99% of the time.  Only three knots required. Lot of flexibility in float adjustment. Years ago I was taught the side cast but it was terrible for line twist. Within a year I switched to a Wallis style cast and I'd never go back.
740165,davey buoy,2012-10-28 13:16:00,5505, With one swivel above the float I would think you loose a float/shot/hook a few times. Unless your tying a smaller lb leader below.
740170,Christopheraaron,2012-10-28 13:45:00,3525,"Sharkbait reminded me, I use mod wallis cast, no need to hold your line."
740174,Christopheraaron,2012-10-28 13:54:00,3525," I use uni-uni but the fastest I would think would be perfection loops, but I could be wrong."
740176,BillM,2012-10-28 14:00:00,17367, Float is on the shot line.
740269,spinnerdoc,2012-10-28 19:18:00,556,"Your right, all the more reason to learn to tie knots properly and pay attention to the water for snags, learn to fight fish properly with your rod and line wt in mind. I have had to loose a few that's for sure, all part of the learning curve for me. The main reason for me doing it this way was to minimize the twist as I use floats that run on the outside of the float. Floats that run thru i have the swivel below."
740483,azebra,2012-10-29 14:37:00,168,"Billm and the swivel above the float tecnique is hand down amazing for elimination line twist. Ive tried it and  and see how it works. But if everyone knows the side cast etc gives line twist why not do what I and several Others do, learn the wallis cast. That is the first cast I ever taught myself and I never have any line twist issues, also I like to stear away from more then one connection, witch is my tippet attached to the main line via a xxxs swivel."
740485,BillM,2012-10-29 14:41:00,17367,"I'm too lazy to learn the Wallis, so I'll just stick with the swivel/braid combo lol!"
740486,azebra,2012-10-29 14:43:00,168,BillM do you carry a variety of shot lines? I might like to try this because if I need a lighter flows taking shot off the line is most times impossible if it doesn't idiot the line it's attached to. THen I get confused about how Long a shot line should be if I were To carry 3 or 4 sometimes I run my float up my main line shorter then my tipper in shallow riffles. And sometimes 9 feet up for those 5 foot deep Holes.  So I'm confused and therefore apprehensive to change my thchnique
740489,BillM,2012-10-29 14:48:00,17367," Nope, I don't use pre-made shot line.  I make the shot line long enough so that I can move the shot/float around to fish the riffle water or the deep stuff. I use 8lb Drennan Super Specialist for shot line, it takes a beating and has no fraying issues when I'm constantly moving shot around on it..   I rarely if ever have shot on my leader, flouro doesn't stand up to well when you start moving shot up and down on it..   If I'm going to a big flow like the Geen, I'll obviously re-rig the night before, but it's the same principle..  I don't run light tippet either, 4-6lb Drennan Flouro or 5.6-6.6 Phantom..  It will consistently bust off before the shot or main line."
740494,azebra,2012-10-29 14:55:00,168,"Sounds interesting. Maybe I'll try it one day, but I'm lazy, if I'm not wallis casting I'll pull Line from the 2nd 3rd guide and swing it out there. My main line is 10 lb stuff I picked up in Guelph( the stores own) then 8.2 down to 4.75lb tipper. I only loose the tippet"
740505,BillM,2012-10-29 15:10:00,17367," If it works for ya, then stick with it..  That's why I'll most likely never learn the Wallis in order to avoid line twist.  I don't get it with my setup."
740512,azebra,2012-10-29 15:27:00,168,Yeah thanks. Although I haven't landed any steel yet this fall.  hope to see you on the river! All the best
740567,manjo39,2012-10-29 19:24:00,354,"On a side note/question:  I'm going to convert to Mod.Wallis cast from side cast to eliminate line twist (as opposed to adding another swivel above the float).  For those with experience with both, which one casts farther?"
740570,BillM,2012-10-29 19:32:00,17367, Side cast.
740578,rhare,2012-10-29 20:02:00,387,   That depends on the person... A good wallis caster can cast as far as someone side casting. A modified wallis or spinning side cast can pretty easily be tossed as far or further then a side cast. It all comes down to timing and technique. Most guys really stink at casting because they really dont have to cast very far in most of the flows we have.
740581,misfish,2012-10-29 20:07:00,29133, Theres my problem.
740583,rhare,2012-10-29 20:15:00,387,"  LOL, It's like riding a bike spend enough time trying and all of a sudden it just happens.  looks like your having lots of fun regardless Brain"
740595,Christopheraaron,2012-10-29 21:19:00,3525, I could probably cast 45 feet if I had to. Don't know if that's good?
739950,misfish,2012-10-27 18:39:00,29133,"A while back,Terry and I went shopping for some terminal tackle. We came across these 3 barrel swivels. He tells me,they are to help with line twists. So we both grab some. I can tell you,that after several outings so far,I have yet to encounter any line twist.Last season was a whine. Im still side casting,with the odd try at the wallis cast,(getting there)  They are pretty much a micro swivel.(amazing what they make these days)I also black maker them to get rid of the bling bling.     Hope this helps others with the twist problem."
739955,fishnsled,2012-10-27 18:56:00,3520,"I had those in my hands yesterday but put them back on the rack as I didn't think I'd did them for what I was doing. Certainly good to hear they work well, may have to try them when jiggin spoons."
739958,davey buoy,2012-10-27 19:14:00,5505, There's another good idea .
739961,kickingfrog,2012-10-27 19:18:00,8333,I've never seen those before. Now I need some.
739962,Leecher,2012-10-27 19:21:00,7832," The single barrel swivel is what I use for trout fishing on my slip bobber rigs and never had any issues with line twist  The triple looks like over kill to me but mind you, never seen any of these on the shelves at any of the sports store in my area"
739964,davey buoy,2012-10-27 19:26:00,5505,Last year I bought the Mustad micro swivels. Very small as it says. Line never twists. I use it as a joiner from the main line to the fluro leader on a float set up. Jb's put me on to them.
739965,misfish,2012-10-27 19:51:00,29133,"Davey,the small one, is a MICRO. I got line twists.Are you sure your getting out enough."
739978,davey buoy,2012-10-27 20:42:00,5505," Mine are the 3 barrel. Almost a micro.lol..I'm getting out again tomorrow,still not enough."
739980,Spiel,2012-10-27 20:44:00,9065,In 30 plus years of float fishing for steelhead I've never tied on a swivel.
739981,Christopheraaron,2012-10-27 20:45:00,3525," I don't use them either, and I can wallis cast."
739982,davey buoy,2012-10-27 20:47:00,5505, Not side casting are you?.
739984,Spiel,2012-10-27 20:51:00,9065," Never have, not sure I'd even know how.  Also never use a float with the line running on the outside, line through floats only."
739985,davey buoy,2012-10-27 20:53:00,5505, See how much I still have to learn! lol.
739987,misfish,2012-10-27 20:56:00,29133,"  So no line twist?  What floats are you using Chris?  Be nice to try something new.    Nice,must be a gift."
739991,Christopheraaron,2012-10-27 21:02:00,3525," I'll teach you, but then we'd need to meet up."
739999,Spiel,2012-10-27 21:10:00,9065," For many years Brian I made my own but these days mostly store bought. The type is simple, a removable stem through the center to pass the line through, no (potential) rotation as you haul it back in. Simply there's no right or wrong, just go with what works for you."
740001,misfish,2012-10-27 21:16:00,29133,"I know what yer talking about.Old school. I have some of them. I,ll give it a try. Thanks"
740004,Spiel,2012-10-27 21:17:00,9065," Yep, that'd be me."
740006,irishfield,2012-10-27 21:18:00,26272," One room that went from SK to grade 12... oh sorry, that be my Mother!"
740007,Spiel,2012-10-27 21:20:00,9065,"  LOL  Grade 12, school goes that high.......  "
740009,Christopheraaron,2012-10-27 21:30:00,3525, Yup. but really 14 if you include 2 years of kindergarden
740019,BillM,2012-10-27 22:05:00,17367,"Swivel above the float, slip floats, Wallis cast or using braid are all ways to avoid line twist.  I run a swivel above my float with braid, no line twist issues ever...."
740022,Snidley,2012-10-27 22:07:00,620,Or float with a baitcaster.
740032,misfish,2012-10-27 22:25:00,29133,"  I run the swivel below the float Bill. Main to my lead I find if I have a break off,I get the float  and swivel back."
740036,kemper,2012-10-27 22:34:00,2232,"Main line (Nanofil) to swivel, to shot line and float (Ultragreen Mono), to swivel, to lead.  Alot of rigging, but the heavy Nano and Ultragreen rarely break off. I find with the fast, heavy rod I use I was pulling too many hooks without a shock/shot leader of mono."
