740025,dsukh,2012-10-27 22:13:00,24,"Hey, I have a question regarding some old skein.  I have a friend who went salmon fishing for the first time back in early September. He took home a hen since it was his first and was really excited to cure the roe and fish the runs.  Long story short, he's never been out since. I asked him if he even cured the roe and he said no. If the skeins were frozen since that day do you think it'll still be good to use? If it is I might take it out of his freezer and cure it to use. Don't want to waste it.  Any ideas? Thanks."
740048,BillM,2012-10-27 23:17:00,17367,"As long as it was frozen, it will be good for years.  I've used 2-3 year old roe without issue after defrosting."
740049,esoxansteel,2012-10-27 23:18:00,1307,"  Should be OK, but will be a b..tch to tie, as in sticky gooey fingers, likely wont treat after been frozen and thawed, but should work very well, for a week or two, you will know when its gone off. LOL"
740070,dsukh,2012-10-27 23:43:00,24,Thanks for the input. I guess I'll take it off him and defrost them. If it smells funky I'll toss them. If they seem okay I'll try to cure them..
740079,Christopheraaron,2012-10-27 23:58:00,3525,If you don't want it I'll take it.     Seriously.
740090,dsukh,2012-10-28 00:19:00,24,I want to rinse the skeins... but don't have access to any distilled water right now. What are the effects of using filtered tap water or bottled water?
740104,Rich,2012-10-28 00:56:00,3927,"Mix a cup of water , half cup salt, cup of brown sugar in a bowl. Mix well . Leave eggs in solution for 4-7 hours in fridge. Drain, dry well, ziploc, re freeze. Good for 2 years , works like a charm."
740150,dsukh,2012-10-28 05:51:00,24, Thanks! Decided to give you recipe a shot.   Now in the fridge
740189,misfish,2012-10-28 14:42:00,29133,  Me too.
740193,BillM,2012-10-28 14:58:00,17367, I've got living proof right here folks!  LOL!
740196,dsukh,2012-10-28 15:04:00,24,"Well I took out the eggs from my fridge just now and noticed the eggs now have a white center (most, not all) can anybody explain this to me? Thanks!"
740197,BillM,2012-10-28 15:06:00,17367," How long did you soak them for?   If overnight, you've got your answer, lol."
740198,dsukh,2012-10-28 15:12:00,24,8 hours? Too much soaking eh? Lol is there a way to fix this?
740199,misfish,2012-10-28 15:19:00,29133,Their cooked.
740200,dsukh,2012-10-28 15:20:00,24,Dam!!!  Okay on to the second half of the skein......
740201,misfish,2012-10-28 15:25:00,29133,"Dont soak them.  Just rub the salt and brown suger into the eggs. Lay out on a pan sheet and air dry. When tacky,seal them."
740203,dsukh,2012-10-28 15:28:00,24,Thanks misfish!
