740506,rippinlipsfishingteam,2012-10-29 15:11:00,76,Bass fishing ... 8 LB floro ... musky crushed my jerkbait..  Thanks to my netman for the 'scoop' !  Definately gives me some confidence with fluorocarbon ... it was wrapped in its teeth like dental floss and held up well !  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aUuv7P3yNDc
740508,mike rousseau,2012-10-29 15:13:00,4661,"Nice looking musky...,,  Any bigger and it woulda been tough with that bet...lol"
740509,rippinlipsfishingteam,2012-10-29 15:16:00,76, Hahahaa.... yup... we woulda had some problems...  All I cared about was landing it so it didn't break me off and have a jerkbait as jewelery for life
740529,captpierre,2012-10-29 16:32:00,2521,"Well done.  Great stuff, that fluorocarbon.  Too stiff to use as the main line on a spinning real.  Are you using a baitcaster?"
740532,ProFishermanJones,2012-10-29 16:35:00,77,Cool video man & a beauty ski
740535,LucG,2012-10-29 16:52:00,779,Nice clip! Is that a tiger?
740537,jimmer,2012-10-29 17:06:00,2730,Looks like a great lakes strain.
740538,LucG,2012-10-29 17:10:00,779, I love the pattern and colour!
740539,kemper,2012-10-29 17:10:00,2232,I've had several saw right through 50lb PowerPro while bass fishing. Toothy buggers.  Nice fish
740552,Christopheraaron,2012-10-29 18:26:00,3525,Nice fish! Size?
740555,Joeytier,2012-10-29 18:43:00,3990,Low to mid 40's I would say.  That was indeed an excellent net job!
740572,Andrew Grant,2012-10-29 19:36:00,201,.
740573,rippinlipsfishingteam,2012-10-29 19:36:00,76,"Yes... 8 LB fluro on a spinning reel !  It is not a tiger, a true tiger has rounded fins... This ski is from the Niagara river, it is a 'barred' muskie.  I didnt weigh or measure it, I wanted to get it back as quick as possible.  We only measure the giants  haha"
740586,Handlebarz,2012-10-29 20:18:00,3790,Love the marks on it great net job for sure
740611,Alumacraft,2012-10-29 22:40:00,139,James nice fish. I've lost lots of jerkbaits on the upper Niagara too those toothy beasts . Rob
740643,rippinlipsfishingteam,2012-10-30 00:10:00,76,"  Hahahaha, yeah buddy.. if anyone knows this you would for sure... lots of these beasts around... especially when you are not looking for them !"
