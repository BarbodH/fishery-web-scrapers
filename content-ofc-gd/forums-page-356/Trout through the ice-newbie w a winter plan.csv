740329,gordy28,2012-10-29 00:17:00,638,So... Some early planning for a winter outing-a first for me-walking into a lake in the Bancroft area to try for splake and perhaps rainbows. I have scouted a few lakes using the 2008-2011 stocking lists and chatting with a bug who summer fisheds in the area Looking for tips and tricks on best spots/structure  and tactics Plan is to go in late Jan/early Feb So far I get the sense that both speices will cruise relatively shallow flats during low light conditions and that dead sticking minnows is a good splake tactic and slow jigging w a small hair jig can be effective for bows Any other generally startegies I should think about employing?  We will be hoofing it-so run and gun will be more like shuffle and spit Anyway-all tips appreciated as always Gordy

740342,gordy28,2012-10-29 00:52:00,638, Thanks although I must admit-I have equally no clue on how to fish for specks.  Winter or any season for that matter So what would be likely structures?  Noticeable points?  Steep breaks etc? I'm barely a bass and walleye guy lol trout are foreign to me
740344,Joeytier,2012-10-29 00:58:00,3990,There's plenty of good articles available online written by people more qualified on the topic than me.
