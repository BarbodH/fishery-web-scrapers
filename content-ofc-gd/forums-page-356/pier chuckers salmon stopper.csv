I figure for less than $50 a guy could have a Fenwick casting rod that would stop a staging Chinook from running away. Don't fish off piers anymore but if I did I would probably consider this rod. Maybe even for straightline/board trolling off the Niagara Bar as well. Lots of lakers/browns to be caught all winter. Here's the info http://ffo-tackle.com/detail.cfm?PassProdId=6014"
