740107,hotsky,2012-10-28 00:59:00,400,"I had a season pass and spent a lot of time there in the summer both fishing off shore and from my inflatable. Never had a bad day with the boat, but got nothing off shore quite a few times. Now that the conservation area is closed I haven't been there in a month. Pretty sure I can't access the conservation side anymore but I can still fish from the other side of the lake. I tried there in the summer a couple of times but didn't catch anything. Remember reading that there aren't as many game fish in that section of the lake (it's separated by a wier) and I know it's pretty shallow in most parts but wanted to head from people who fished there in the fall/winter? Any point trying? Is it mostly panfish and bullheards?  btw if anyone wants any info on fishing the main part of the lake PM me."
740111,Rich,2012-10-28 01:11:00,3927,I fished it in march once. Brought my aluminum in.. was quite a trek. We got a lotta small carp in one random area. Bullheads in some spots. Nothing else of interest.
740112,uglyfish,2012-10-28 01:12:00,981,"winter ice fishing can be great. lots of crappie and smaller perch. game fish are making a comeback, more and more caught each year. usually see a decent pike, and some really good walleye and bass caught each winter."
740113,hotsky,2012-10-28 01:15:00,400,"I've caught bass, pike, carp, bullhead and quite a few crappies in the conservation area side. I assume I cant go there anymore now that it's closed till may, no? That's why I was asking about the other side of the lake?"
740114,gogu392,2012-10-28 01:17:00,142,Thanks to the smart guys from Hamilton airport that lake is higly contaminated (fire retardand substances).  Check this as well. http://www.downloads.ene.gov.on.ca/files/fishguide/en/advisories/LAKE43077948.html  Fishing is fine as long you release all the fish you catch. Now should be the hunting seasone there. I don't think is a good idea to go fishinh there now.
740126,hotsky,2012-10-28 02:06:00,400,Thanks for the link. I know about the toxins in the water and never kept a fish from there (I always release the fish I catch). Pretty sure hunting is only allowed in the conservation (hunting 'stalls' stay there all year) but didn't see any in the north/west side.
740434,Rich,2012-10-29 09:29:00,3927,You can walk in any conservation area during off season.. i thought that was the rule?
740613,hotsky,2012-10-29 22:49:00,400,Maybe i just never tried lol. I'll check it out sometime.
740898,HyperActive,2012-10-30 21:28:00,56,"I was there two weekends ago,  I threw cranks until I lost my favorite one. Then I went down to worms and waited for a bit.  I was happy just being out fishing but it was kinda a buzz kill being skunked there and on the Grand on the same day."
