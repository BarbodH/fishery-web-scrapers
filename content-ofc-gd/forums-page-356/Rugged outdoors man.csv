The man said he spent 3 days a week, every week in the outdoors:  ""Well, yesterday afternoon was typical;  I took a five hour walk about 7km through some pretty rough terrain.  I waded along the edge of a lake. I pushed my way through 2km of brambles.  I got sand in my shoes and my eyes. I avoided standing on a snake.  I climbed several rocky hills.  I took a few 'leaks' behind some big trees.  I ran away from a pissed off mother bear and then ran away from one angry bull Elk  The mental stress of it all left me shattered.  At the end of it all I drank eight beers and a tall glass of scotch""  Amazed by the story, the doctor said, ""You must be one hell of an outdoors man!""  ""No,"" the guy replied, ""I'm just a really lousy golfer"". "
