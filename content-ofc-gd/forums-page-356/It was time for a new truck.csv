740033,Grimace,2012-10-27 22:28:00,2020,Great looking truck!  I think all of the makes are pushing out some quality trucks.  I like them all.
740035,woodenboater,2012-10-27 22:33:00,2277,My wife and I are due for a new truck in the next few years but this thread makes me wanna get one now !
740037,lew,2012-10-27 22:36:00,12766,"Very nice Shaun, awesome looking truck and congrats on your purchase !!  From what I've heard, that fuel management  system is pretty slick."
740195,BillM,2012-10-28 15:00:00,17367,"Lew, it's time to update that sig!"
740207,ch312,2012-10-28 15:34:00,1590," 17 US mpg = 21 IMP mpg = 13.5 l/100km  that's exactly what my 07 ram with 1.5"" higher and 1"" wider than stock tires gets with 75% city and 25% highway driving. i'd expect more after all the hype about the eco boost.    time to go out and take off the fan clutch to squeeze a little more mpg out of her during the cold months..."
740223,aplumma,2012-10-28 16:38:00,6896,"  It doesn't have a fan belt all electric. With the 3.31 gear set  you can get 21 MPG but I don't know why people think we buy a 4X4 full crew cab with 2.72 gears, e locking differentials and a tow package rated at 11,300 LBS for gas mile ratings.   If I want to go far on a little gas I can chose the Cooper, 3 motorcycles or the volkswagen. when you got to tow weight the better the truck is set up the less strain you put on the vehicle and the SAFER you can tow.

740234,mike rousseau,2012-10-28 17:19:00,4661,How much for the old one Lew...???  Free trips on the Larry for life...???  LMAO...
740240,lew,2012-10-28 17:32:00,12766,Maybe free trips for a FEW lifetimes Mike...in YOUR boat
740371,ch312,2012-10-29 02:13:00,1590," i was talking about my truck. i take the fan clutch (big fan attached to the front of the engine) off every winter to help with getting to operating temp quicker just like i did with the dakota. it still runs at the exact same temperature as with the fan on, but long idling isn't a good idea. i sat in a drive thru for 10 mins today and the needle didn't move.  i believe she has the 3.55 gears."
740787,doubleheader,2012-10-30 15:57:00,497,"Lew, very nice looking. That is my favorite color scheme, almost traded my Tundra in on a new one just to get it. Hope she brings years of good service."

739550,DRIFTER_016,2012-10-25 16:23:00,10439,  Expect the prices to rise on Wednesday November 7th.
739557,Billy Bob,2012-10-25 16:34:00,5865," I know what your getting at.......both either of what happens on Nov 6th...gas prices will still continue to FALL...I will bet you not one but 2 DOZEN nightcrawlers our gas prices continue to fall until maybe the week of our Thanksgiving, as those days are the busiest travel days in the U.S.A. of all year long....then again continue to drop....UNLESS there is some Bull crappola insistent in the middle east..."
739558,SlowPoke,2012-10-25 16:34:00,2984,LOL!!! I figured I could double the resale value of my Suburban if I sold it with a full tank! I decided to keep it for winter/ice fishing while the new one hibernates.
739562,Fish Farmer,2012-10-25 16:52:00,2234,"Nice new ride Lew, that's a Bute! I see you bought another truck. Anything other than a FORD is not a truck.   Just ask Brian. OK guys I'll stick my head up my ass"
739566,Peps,2012-10-25 17:11:00,191,Heck of a truck Lew congrats!!!!
739585,rob v,2012-10-25 18:19:00,535,"That's a fancy looking rig there Lew.   I'm sure you'll be happy in that one.  Somebody's going to pick up a nice, used red 2010 in great shape too !!"
739587,Hooked,2012-10-25 18:26:00,891,"That Lew is the way to live a retired life.  Treating yourself with man toys!  Very nice truck you got there btw, I mean really nice."
739595,aplumma,2012-10-25 19:11:00,6896,Good move Lew I have the 2012 Eco Boost as you saw at Lak Air. Mine went to Canada and back loaded 12 hours straight and pulling the Ranger boat averaged 14.5 MPG. That may seem low to some but I have the 4X4 with the 3.72 gear set and E locker combo. The tow package in the trucks are set up right and it is a bull of a truck. I average 17 MPG without the boat around town and highway otherwise. I would check on the rock guard on the intercooler Ford does not want the air flow obstructed and can void the warrentee if it is a heat related failure from what I was told.   Art
739628,Bernie,2012-10-25 23:00:00,3190,Great looking ride Lew. Love the interior and the colour!  Congratulations on a great new truck.
739635,bigbuck,2012-10-26 00:12:00,2449,"Nice ride Lew! Use it in good health. It sure is a nice truck. If you stick to the speed limit on the highway, it will be decent on fuel."
739641,Donnie,2012-10-26 00:24:00,11,The new SYNC in Ford's is crazy cool. Every vehicle I drive without it seems like its out of the Flintstones. Maybe I'm just a techie at heart but to me it's the cats meow.
739647,Billy Bob,2012-10-26 00:58:00,5865," OH....I would of thought that the Ford Eco-Boost would give you even better mileage then that...I would of bet it would of beat my Tundra in mileage....in comparison my Tundra that came with the tow package has a rear end axle ratio of 4:11.....it's a figgin brute for towing anything...  On a recent trip to Ontario I filled up here and towed my boat to a small lake near Parry Sound, Ontario.....I filled up just before Parry Sound at a gas station right off Rt69 just before Rt 518...so that was if I remember correctly 235 miles up to that point....I filled up and I squeezed in 50 litres...now correct if I'm wrong with this math....so I divided the 50 litres to get gallons...50/3.78 = 13.22 USA gallons (right...  )....then divided the 235 miles by the 13.22 gallons and I got 17.77 miles per USA gallons...My Tundra is a Double Cab 4X4 with the 4.7 litre engine and a 5 speed automatic tranny with 4:11 rear end axle....this truck has a towing capacity of 8000 lbs."
739759,aplumma,2012-10-26 19:02:00,6896,Nope you got me Bob I'm not sure how the world will continue if we all don't buy a Tundra.  The fact that I had 6000 lbs between the boat and the equipment I was bringing up North might have something to do with my gas milage. The 75 Mph speed we averaged didn't help either. I'm glad you are happy with the Tundra my experiences with them paints a much blacker picture hence the Ford in my life.   Art
739760,Billy Bob,2012-10-26 19:10:00,5865, The 6000 pounds is a huge difference that what my boat weights...I'm closer to the 2000 pounds at MOST....plus I was restricted to the Canadian MPH limit of 100K or I believe about 62 MPH....the more you push it the more drag on the vehicles and then the mileage drops like a rock....and since I am only about 15 miles from the boarder pretty much all my driving was done (in the middle lane...  ) at 62 miles per hour....so YES then the big difference does make some sense.
739761,lew,2012-10-26 19:22:00,12766,"When I purchased this truck, I went with the Eco Boost just because I've heard alot of good things about it, not because it's gonna save me a whack of money on gas. I wanted to stay with Ford and wanted plenty of towing power and the Eco seems like it'll do what I want.  Sounds like it may be somewhat more economical than my current 5.4 and if that's the case, that'll be good, but I'm certainly not expecting a huge savings.  I have a glass boat with a 150 HP Yammie and that also goes thru alot of gas but I also knew that when I purchased it a couple years ago.  If I was really concerned about the cost of gas, I'd be towing a 12' tinnie with a Honda Civic.  We'd all like to pay less for gas, but it ain't gonna happen so we just have to suck it up and if we want to play, we're gonna pay."
739763,Headhunter,2012-10-26 20:00:00,5703,"Geez Lew, by the time this thread starts to die off and people just drive away in their respective trucks, that ash tray may be full again! HH"

739881,lew,2012-10-27 13:53:00,12766," Nope, I just have a very understanding wife Steve"
739887,Skipper D,2012-10-27 14:13:00,1970,How many liters cod liver oil dose it take Lew in the crank case ?  
739903,nancur373,2012-10-27 15:45:00,1211," Exactly Lew. We don`t buy a truck for the fuel economy. We buy what fits our needs in a truck. We have our make and models we associate with and we get what we need within that brand. The reason i have a GMC 2500 Diesel is because the 1500 doesn`t come with a 6.6`box when you have 4 door. I got a diesel just because the price suited my budget. I am a GM guy but i drive a Ford at work and quite enjoy it. That being said, I`d never buy one...lol  Nice Truck Lew...hope she treats you well."

739396,SlowPoke,2012-10-25 02:23:00,2984,"Must be something going on with his Ford, my Ram does 18/100 towing. I can get 12/100 if I'm really eco-concious when I'm not towing.... about the same as my old Suburban"
739425,Joey,2012-10-25 03:43:00,9122,"Well that sure is purdy, for a Ford  Very nice Lew, congrats.  That looks like a really nice vehicle.  I'm sure you'll get lots of comfort and enjoyment out of her"
739426,northernpike56,2012-10-25 03:45:00,717,"wow 365 horsepower is a lot of power!! I go in a 385 hp porsche, 100 km/h in about 4 1/2 seconds. 300 horsepower bmw, goes to 100 in 5.4s. That truck must fly then (for a truck)! nice purchase!  EDIT: here's a cool video of a ford raptor (another fast one) "
739428,nofish4me,2012-10-25 04:00:00,404,"Nice ride!  Just out of curiosity, what colour would you call, ""Fire Engine Red""? Hahaha"
739435,Ron,2012-10-25 04:43:00,1683,"You won't be disappointed Lew. I will tell you however, it takes a good number of miles before you get the fuel consumption ratings. As for towing capacity, the eco boost has one of the higher ratings. My brother bought one and put 1000kms on it before going to Lake Nipigon with it towing a 37 ft. fifth wheel and behind that, his 21ft Skeeter. Fuel consumption was better on his than my Tundra hauling my 17.5ft Lund.  He is now getting in the neighborhood of 30 mpg hauling empty."
739443,lew,2012-10-25 06:45:00,12766,"Thanks folks, I'm lookin forward to a few good years with this truck.  For those of you who asked about the colour, it's called Kodiak Brown. It's very dark and does almost appear black in the picture, but looks really sharp, specially when the light hits it.  The suggestion for the screen cover for the inter-cooler is a good idea and something I'll look into.  As for the Eco Boost, I can only hope it's as good as what I've heard. I've talked to a few guys who have it and for the most part, their very happy. I read alot of the different websites and there's always talk about trucks and again, the vast majority of folks with the Eco Boost have positive things to say. I'm getting around 13-14/100k with the 5.4, so we'll see how the Eco stacks up to those numbers.  Thanks for the comparison with your brothers truck Ron, that's the kinda stuff I've been hearing.  Anyone who thinks they'll get good mileage with a truck, specially towing a heavier boat is only kidding themselves, but we should all realize that going in. I figure gas prices are what they are and there's nothing we can do about it.  This truck was a huge amount of $$$$, so the few dollars I'll save on gas with the Eco boost have long since vanished anyways   :lol:  Gerry, that's a good looking rig you've got there. I looked for you  this past summer when we we're heading north, it woulda been good to hook up for awhile...maybe next year.  Jim, looking forward to seeing you and the rest of the folks next weekend, it's gonna be a great trip.  nofish4me, the fire engine red is actually called Red Pearl and is pretty nice  And just so you know Brian, Diane and I had lunch at the A&W last week and after all these years, I still go for the Poppa Burger & a HUGE mug of root beer every time"
739445,Gerry,2012-10-25 07:40:00,257,"Wayne,  I have the 5.0L. I looked very closely at the Ecoboost and did plenty of 'real world' research on it. The results showed that the fuel consumption was the same for both. I test drove both before and I was really impressed with the power of the Ecoboost, practically the same power as the 5.0L. The Ecoboost's rated HP is 365, while the 5.0 is 360. What swayed me to stick with the 5.0L was that Ford wanted $2k more for the Ecoboost with no advantage in fuel savings or pulling power. Some say they'll reap the rewards on resale, that the 5.0L will depreciate more but I'm not convinced that this will be the case......but I have been wrong before so who knows.  In any case they are both really nice trucks, the power difference from my 2006 5.4L is amazing.  Lew, I left a little early that day so I was actually ahead of you."
739447,lew,2012-10-25 08:26:00,12766,"Gerry, there's some interesting reading if you rummage thru these pages and some good comparisons between the 5.0 and the Eco Boost.  http://www.caranddriver.com/photo-gallery/ford-f-series-review-2011-ford-f-150-ecoboost-drive"
739452,Billy Bob,2012-10-25 09:40:00,5865,"What a PURDY NEW TRUCK...  ..just check your owners manual to see if/how many miles they want on that engine BEFORE towing anything.

Actually our gas prices are FINALLY coming down....down her 10 cents to now $3.99 per gallon....but my son just moved to Virginia and gas there is only $3.23 per gallon and their expecting it to drop below $3...maybe even close to $2.50 per gallon as the weeks go on."
739300,lew,2012-10-24 21:23:00,12766,"I decided a couple years back to get myself a  pick-up and bought a new 2010 F-150 Super Crew with the 5.4 engine and 310 HP.    It's been a fantastic truck but I decided yesterday it was time to up-grade again and wanted to move up to an F-150 Lariat with a bunch of toys.  I drove down to the dealer in Peterboro yesterday afternoon and darned if he didn't have exactly what I wanted sitting right there on his lot. We did a bit of haggling back & forth until we came to a price we were both happy with, signed some papers,  and the deal was done.  I've heard alot of good stuff about the new Eco Boost engine with 365 horsepower so that's what I got in it.  I went with a dark brown truck with light brown leather bucket seats.    20"" chrome wheels     The seats are 10 way power and have both heat and cooling function.    I also got the center consol shifter.    It's got an 8"" screen in the dash for GPS and also a back-up camera that shows in the same screen when the truck is in reverse. Very nice for hooking up the boat trailer.    Power moon roof plus power sliding rear window, power adjustable pedals and telescoping steering wheel.    And more bells & whistles than I can even remember right now, but the truck basically does everything but drive itself  They still have to spray in the Line-x bed liner and install the tonneau  cover plus a couple other things, but I'll be getting it Monday morning.  I'm hauling the boat down to Lake St. Clair in about 8 or 9 days so that should be a good test for the new rig.  Anyways, just thought some may be interested."

739366,Gerry,2012-10-25 00:36:00,257,"Lew,  Congrats on the new truck. It looks very much like mine:         "
739377,BillM,2012-10-25 01:05:00,17367, EcoBoost gets about the same mileage as the V8 unfortunately.  I'm sure Ford is pulling their hair out over that.
739378,irishfield,2012-10-25 01:09:00,26272,"Nice new Ride Lew! You sure that ain't black?  As Bill notes.... let us know your thoughts after you put some miles on it. I had a cop at a ride check call me a c... s..... after looking at my (5.0 litre coyotes) fuel consumption read out showing 11.8 or so litres/100km. Told me his ""ecobust"" was burning 18litres/100km. Hope he was just an odd duck and hope that 6 has the guts to pull your heavy boat.  Gerry.. you have the Ecoboost or the 5.0 in yours???"
