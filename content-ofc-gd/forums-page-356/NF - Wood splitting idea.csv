740182,SlowPoke,2012-10-28 14:25:00,2984,"At 2:40 into the video, this gentleman shows a great way to contain wood while splitting it by using a tire. I can see another benefit to this, if you miss the wood with the axe, the tire would probably prevent it from going into the ground... or your shin!  "
740217,Sinker,2012-10-28 16:13:00,8692,I prefer my 22 ton splitter myself  Much easier!  S.
740218,misfish,2012-10-28 16:19:00,29133, Yep. Spilt and let it fall in the wagon.  Good idea for doing up your kindleing though.
740224,TroutnMuskieHunter,2012-10-28 16:43:00,1362,  Me too
740225,kickingfrog,2012-10-28 16:43:00,8333,Imagine if he knew how to sharpen that maul.
740243,captpierre,2012-10-28 17:42:00,2521,awesome.  I'm gonna try that
740254,misfish,2012-10-28 18:23:00,29133,"  We did a major clean up, when my parents bought their house up north. I guess the previous owners , thought it would just disappear.   :wallbash:  It,s a sweet piece of property now."
740255,Roy,2012-10-28 18:27:00,13728," There's no neighbour pressure, also no pressure from the municipalities because they need your tax dollars."
740260,Twocoda,2012-10-28 18:52:00,4130,resourceful dude..air dried clothes (check) re invent the wheel (check) recycled old tire (check)  It is a good idea
740261,OhioFisherman,2012-10-28 18:53:00,6623," Even here stateside in farm country it seems as though some people with large tracts of land are to cheap to pay for trash collection. It is not provided here with tax dollars in a lot of rural areas, an out of the pocket expense, so they take their trash into their wood and hide it from sight."
740262,irishfield,2012-10-28 18:53:00,26272, Because we can !
740263,misfish,2012-10-28 18:56:00,29133," I have walked your property,it,s spotless.  Unless your hiding it good.LOL"
740279,irishfield,2012-10-28 19:43:00,26272," Guess the trees have grown in good enough.. around the 6 aircraft, 2 trucks, 3 trailers, backhoe etc back there.. LOL"
740282,irishfield,2012-10-28 19:52:00,26272,"  ahhh no... 6 airplane wrecks.. 2 rusting dodge ramchargers.. my old tent trailer that I converted to put the 12' tinney in back in ,83.. another trailer... a JD410 backhoe.. an '83 Southwind... and all sorts of assorted crap. It's what you do with your back ""20"" when you own acreage. Store crap ""that you might use someday"".  The log split idea... gonna use that at the lake.. looks slick for slapping them poplar trees. As for the oak and maple in the yard, I'll stick to the hydraulic on the tractor!"
740283,Sinker,2012-10-28 19:58:00,8692,"The guy is resourceful enough that he probably uses all that "" junk"" you see around his place. Guys like Sinclair, throw all that ""junk"" away, and go buy new ""junk"" instead of using a bit of ingenuity to make it!  citiots have no clue!  S."
740292,irishfield,2012-10-28 20:24:00,26272,  Glad you didn't ask that of me... mine is made from the front axle out of an old 40's truck (c/w spindles and wheels).. a 6' I beam and a hydraulic cylinder that I picked up somewhere along the way!
740478,Billy Bob,2012-10-29 14:26:00,5865,I would of swore we were going to witness him have a heart attack...
740484,Sinker,2012-10-29 14:38:00,8692,"  Hey, I never said I was resourceful........and didn't say I had all that junk on MY property.  Also didn't call YOU a citiot.....just sayin  Calling me a citiot is laughable at best  Anyways, have a great day  S."
740499,cityfisher,2012-10-29 15:01:00,959,good idea...id use it for some softwoods but no chance on super hard maples.. Splitter please!
740517,Sinker,2012-10-29 15:52:00,8692,"I just found it odd that you assumed all back woods properties were covered in ""junk"". For all you know, they could be making a living off that junk.  The comment was one I thought would come from a citiot. You know, the ones who move in to a home next to that guy, and then complain about his ""junk""......meanwhile, the guy is being resourceful, and making useful things out of it. Some people just like to do that sort of thing when they have the room on their country lots to store the ""junk"".  S."
740540,Billy Bob,2012-10-29 17:11:00,5865,"Have either of you boys watched ""American Pickers""......many of the places they stop at have so much ""STUFF"" you can't even walk in some of those buildings...  http://www.history.com/shows/american-pickers/videos/american-pickers-mikes-breakdown"
