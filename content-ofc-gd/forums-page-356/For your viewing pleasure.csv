I don't take many pictures, usually just unhook and go but every once in a while when someone is nearby with a camera...  A summer-run fish - big water, incredible fight.    Yesterday, after losing six in a row in only 15 minutes (best losing streak ever!) this beauty came to hand.     These funky little guys are showing up all over the place this year.     Recycled this one from last year, found it on my photobucket account. Not sure if it was posted before or not.     My type of skyline.       Sorry for chopping the backgrounds, a couple of these are spectacular but they're going to remain that way on my computer only.  Cheers,  Kemper"

740061,kickingfrog,2012-10-27 23:33:00,8333,Not one picture of a pick-up??? Come on man!
740068,d_paluch,2012-10-27 23:42:00,343,"lovin the pics man. I really should start fishing rivers, looks like a beautiful way to spend a day in the water. Problem is I don't even know where to start (tackle wise).      time to research      "

740077,Christopheraaron,2012-10-27 23:56:00,3525,Lovin' those pinks! nice shootin!
740080,Rod Caster,2012-10-27 23:59:00,5784,"Those pinks look so odd, yet very interesting."
740084,kemper,2012-10-28 00:06:00,2232," They're fun...for the first three. Small, and don't put up much of a fight on steelhead gear.  Give me a 4wt fly rod and it might be a different story.   They're certainly different. Seem to have more of a skin then scales..."
