739872,Jewelbee,2012-10-27 13:29:00,422,"Hoping our southern friends ""dodge the bullet"" on this one!"
739875,Terry,2012-10-27 13:33:00,14456,I saw the movie      no one survives     woman stops in the middle of the road as her drowning husband dieing words are of his love for her ..end of movie
739877,Live2fish85,2012-10-27 13:38:00,1633,  Haha. I thought the same thing when I read the headline on the weather network.
739891,Sinker,2012-10-27 14:31:00,8692,Bah....a bit of rain and wind.....and its the end of the world. Gimme a break!! Media hype at its finest!!  S.
739892,woodenboater,2012-10-27 14:34:00,2277,"Speaking of that, I hope our friends up Wawa way get some relief from the heavy weather they're experiencing.  http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/wawa-under-state-of-emergency-after-heavy-rain-causes-flooding/article4709781/"
739909,NBR,2012-10-27 16:03:00,163,Maybe a bit of rain and wind to those who didn't experience Irene but to the Vermonters who are still recovering from Irene it is sure to cause them to hunker down. Look at Hurrican Irene in Vermont for pictures!
739923,Twocoda,2012-10-27 16:40:00,4130,looks like winter is going to come in like a lion ...I think we might pay this year for last years mildness...we seen a fire tornado (you tube) last summer ...it would only be fitting to see a snow tornado now...  All in all it means the masses will stay away from the rivers for the comforts of their homes
739926,spincast,2012-10-27 16:47:00,3279,"and here was me thinking we had someone claiming to have new muskie record, and predicting what the discussion would turn into ....    but seriously, hope the weatherman is wrong..... again."
739935,big guy,2012-10-27 17:09:00,414,"It will only be considered the perfect storm if it takes Gary Bettman out. Until then, it's just a big wrong word storm."

739940,jedimaster,2012-10-27 17:22:00,3472,Anyone want to start a Bettman on a boat fund. Haha
739974,Rich Clemens,2012-10-27 20:25:00,3131,"If the forecasts are true, I'm in for a few interesting days.  Hope our good OFC friends a couple hours south of us make it thru ok"
740012,Billy Bob,2012-10-27 21:37:00,5865,I will be watching this one......I have one son who just moved to Virginia and other stationed in Maryland.......
740160,outllaw,2012-10-28 13:01:00,1232,"hope they fare well billybob,,,and have good rain gear"
740209,craigdritchie,2012-10-28 15:40:00,1586,So much for my Monday-Tuesday business trip to the States. Flights all along the east coast are being cancelled.
740211,ch312,2012-10-28 15:47:00,1590," exactly. every winter a storm rolls in and the weathermen make it sound like the ""storm of the century"" is coming and it often results in a whopping 2-3"" of snow.    more media hype to boost ratings and people fall for it every time..."
740219,aplumma,2012-10-28 16:29:00,6896,The forecast is Heavy rain tonight with flooding extending to Tuesday morning. 8-10 inches likely with winds at 30- 40 MPH and gusts to 50 MPH in areas. The big boat is double lined and set with 4 ft leashes for coastal flooding. The danger here is the rain saturating the ground and the trees blowing down on the power lines. They have other crews coming in from other states but the trees on the roads and the winds will make a power outage more than likely 3-5 days depending on what day it goes out. This is the forecast we have planned for we hope it is less but they have been pretty close on the storm forecasts around here being our governments power base being so close to us.  Thanks for the well wishes we will keep you posted if we have power and internet.     Art
740242,Twocoda,2012-10-28 17:40:00,4130,Ive always wondered...after all the preparation filling sand bags for the storm surges...what do they do with all the bags of sand? Free labour for packaging sand box sand  profits should be healthy
740244,lew,2012-10-28 17:42:00,12766, I had a 10 KW standby generator installed here at the house last spring for just such a scenario Art. Haven't had to use it yet but it's nice to know it's ready if and when the time ever arrives.  Hope you guys do OK down there till the storm blows over.
740259,kickingfrog,2012-10-28 18:52:00,8333,Now calling for chance of snow now in central Ontario. Hope the wind and rain take the leaves off first.
740288,Sinker,2012-10-28 20:14:00,8692,"Most of the leaves are gone here now, so I would think central is pretty clear of leaves.  I'm still skeptical of what we're going to get up here. They can't get the 24hr forcast right, so why should I think they can get several days in advance right? Mother nature is going to do what she wants. Weather systems are constantly changing. Our models can't keep up with the rate they are changng, and a lot of times, are dead wrong.  Good luck to you guys in the south!  S."
740291,Rich Clemens,2012-10-28 20:20:00,3131,  Just be safe guys ...  all of ya !!!
740310,northernpike56,2012-10-28 23:28:00,717,"hopefully, all this water brings my steelhead into the tribs!!!"
740324,Twocoda,2012-10-28 23:59:00,4130,I wonder at what wind speed ...do they shut the CN Tower down?....might be kinda fun to be up there for a storm...
740429,Moosebunk,2012-10-29 08:39:00,3970,Gonna be hard to notice a walleye on and the boards fall back on Quinte when trolling into 100K winds on Tuesday. lol.  Play safe this week.
