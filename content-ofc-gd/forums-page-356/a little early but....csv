Peter."
740577,Joeytier,2012-10-29 20:00:00,3990,"I've never been, but I'd imagine Rosseau or lake Muskoka would fit your needs pretty well?"
740587,jimmer,2012-10-29 20:21:00,2730,"It's finding the location that will offer you what Nipissing does in regards to accommodations and huts. There are some resorts in the Minden area that have rooms/cottages and a short walk to your hut. There are slots on Lakers and you can only use one rod through the ice on those lakes though. Lake Bernard south of Nipissing is said to be okay, don't know if there are packages offered on that lake though."
740615,Rod Caster,2012-10-29 22:55:00,5784,Try something on temagami? I don't know any outfitters but I'm sure you could google search then ask for feedback on here
740620,FishAbout,2012-10-29 23:07:00,106,Lake muskoka and rosseau does not really have any outfitters to rent from and not many good spots that are in walking distance. Temagami has some nice places for a decent price.
740625,kuhaman,2012-10-29 23:19:00,503,Lake Simcoe? Check out Ontario out of doors ice hut rundown. Lots of good info on places there.
740633,gordy28,2012-10-29 23:31:00,638,"Check Minden and Haliburton There are operators on Boshkung, Mountain and Kashawigamog who offer hut and accomodation packages.  I believe there is on Koshlong as well. I used one of the huts on Boshkung before for an afternoon - they were old, but heated and serviceable. Was a few years back but in 4 hours we caught a small laker and missed 2 ""fish"" either whities or lakers.  We went with Buttermilk Falls (we actually were just going to fish-but lack of parking and time we got a good deal to go out for 4 hours via snowmobile) Cheers Gordy"
740659,bobowski,2012-10-30 01:53:00,360,I would say Temagami. Lots of options up there. http://www.temagamiicefishing.com/lake-temagami-icehut-operators.html Simcoe also has what your looking for and its closer.
740689,Nipfisher,2012-10-30 03:16:00,2449,"Tallon Lake just outside of North Bay has rental huts and nice cabins to stay in. Good #s of Lakers to be caught but not many real big ones. Pike, and walleye are pretty good all winter."
740828,whiskywizard,2012-10-30 18:18:00,305,"  Have you thought about the Bay of Quinte? Great walleye, some really good sized ones, plus perch, crappie and pike. Much less than 3 hours from Bolton. I have a friend who has stayed at Baycrest Lodge and really liked it.   ."
740912,peter23,2012-10-30 22:20:00,95,thanks!
740920,Stoty,2012-10-30 22:41:00,2910,"Def make the drive to Quinte if your schedule allows it.... But do yourself a favour and focus on Walleye. It's a world class Walleye fishery and by far the best chance at landing a true trophy (well over 10lbs) plus tons of 2-5lb ""eaters"" as well.  Mind you, while Walleye fishing, you're likely to hit some Jumbo perch, and the odd other species as well, but 95% of people go to Quinte for the chance at a MONSTER walleye. Def worth it if you land that fish of a lifetime!"
740922,bobowski,2012-10-30 22:52:00,360,I would also suggest Bay of Quinte if Lakers and Whitefish aren't your focus. Tons of Walleye with 7lb + fish common.
