739827,justwannafish,2012-10-27 00:59:00,82,Hey everyone I'm taking the tinny out for one last haul before I cover it up for the winter. I'm probably just gonna hit up Hamilton harbour but I'm not so sure what's there this time of year if anything. Just thought I'd ask you guys if its worth it to head out there for my last trip or not  Any advice is good advice! Thanks guys
739838,registerfly,2012-10-27 02:17:00,198,was out there a couple weekends ago and was kinda quiet. Mind you I was lazy and only paddled around for about 3-4hrs around the beach and pier area. In that time only saw a couple rises.
739843,justwannafish,2012-10-27 03:26:00,82,Yeah I'll giver a go You just throwin spinners and spoons? I'm a big soft plastic guy but ain't so sure they'll bite on that there this time of year
739925,northernpike56,2012-10-27 16:45:00,717,"there will probably be bass and pike, and some salmon in bayfront this time of year, as well as perch. In november then there are rainbow and brown trout in the harbour."
