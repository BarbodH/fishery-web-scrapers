739669,Bassassins,2012-10-26 02:07:00,111,"Rob and I got out tonight for a little evening bite hunting some smallmouth in one of our little bass locations. After some successful bass drop shoting things seemed to slow down a little..... Rob says ""we should throw a crank on and see what happens."" FIRST CAST... that's right FIRST CAST! I tossed out my crank... a little slow wobble and BOOM ROD BENT!!! HEART WAS POUNDING right up until it was in our hands... still is a little now I will admit.  Here it is.....     SPEECHLESS!!! My PB EYE and PB fish... WHAT A BEAAASSTTT! Enjoy....  Smooth!"
739672,Rod Caster,2012-10-26 02:15:00,5784,What a beast. Did you know there were walleye that size in there?

739686,Bassassins,2012-10-26 03:37:00,111, We had seen a few smaller ones over the summer and I caught a couple of my fly rod around 16inches earlier in the year amongst the bass.... NEVER would have expected to find that.  Thought it was a pike at first... SHOCKED! when I got it in to me.  Smooth!

740474,Bassassins,2012-10-29 14:17:00,111," I am fishing in downtown Ottawa - in a river that is known for Bass.  We had bumped into pike, muskie and small walleye in that area BUT nothing like that. So yes its big for where I caught it, yes its the biggest reported in that area and yes it is my personal best by far. lol  Thanks everyone.....  Smooth!"
740476,Terry,2012-10-29 14:20:00,14456,"Cool, its always great to  hear someone getting a personal best"
