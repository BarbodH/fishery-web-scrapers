(Grey County)."" and that is under the extended fall season in zone 16.  I think that means its open near Georgian Bay in Meaford.  Normally it gives you 2 streets where its open between or closed between those 2 streets.  here's the link  http://www.mnr.gov.on.ca/stdprodconsume/groups/lr/@mnr/@letsfish/documents/document/mnr_e001335.pdf  Thanks guys!
