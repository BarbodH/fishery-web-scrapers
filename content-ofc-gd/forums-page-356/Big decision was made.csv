740353,Loonietoon,2012-10-29 01:35:00,1450,"We I made a decision Friday after weeks of debate and Quite my job after 6 yrs with the same company. I have not had a raise in 6 yrs even though I had asked on numerous occasions and nothing can, I was approached by the owner of a company that I do some consulting for to come work directly for him. We came to a wage we could both live with and Friday was my last day for the company that I did 6 yrs work for. Monday (on my Birthday) I start my new job. Time to move on. 20 min from home 40 min each day compared to 2.5 plus hrs per day.. Win Win situation... Just thought I would share with my friends (Family)"

740382,kickingfrog,2012-10-29 02:34:00,8333,"Good to hear. It's hard to even put a proper value on that much less time commuting every day, week, month and year."
740427,Ice Fishing Ham,2012-10-29 08:32:00,83,Good for you LT. Hope all works works out for you. I made a change 7 years ago and it was the best thing I ever did.
740440,lew,2012-10-29 11:21:00,12766,Good to hear things are looking up for you Kelvin !!
740477,shane,2012-10-29 14:20:00,652,  That's for sure. I would say it's worth it just for the reduced commute time.
740480,moxie,2012-10-29 14:31:00,1566,"Its a scary proposition to jump ship and start fresh somewhere else at any time let alone in these challenging times we are currently facing. Is seems like its a win win for you, your family and your new employer. ""The grass is always greener on the other side"" cliche has been beat to death but if we never hop the fence and take a closer look there are many opportunities missed IMHO. Good luck. Oh ya, almost forgot. Happy Birthday."
740607,Whopper,2012-10-29 22:04:00,2174,Sounds like you treated yourself to an early birthday present. Congrats Kelvin and Happy Birthday!
