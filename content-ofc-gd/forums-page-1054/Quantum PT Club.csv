Came across something they are doing called the ""Quantum PT Club.""  http://www.quantumfishing.com/extras/ptclub.html  It is a free club to join, and you accumulate ""points"" based on the PT reels or rods you have purchased. For instance, my two Accurist PT's would garner me 12 points each.  You can then order hats, beanies, shirts, jackets, and even a bar stool with the points you accumulate. For my 24 points, I could get a long sleeve shirt (20 points) or a hat, visor and beanie (7 points each).  Just for joining, you get a free patch and boat decal.  You do have to include $4.95 (shipping) for each order.  Also, you can either get a rebate OR this merchandise - you can not receive both.  The Quantum PT Club is available to anglers purchasing Quantum PT rods and reels purchased between December 1, 2005 and December 31, 2008.  Thought some folk's on here might be interested. I've opted for the rebate with these latest reels I've purchased, but once the rebate period ends, I'll definitely be getting some of this swag...  Good Fishing,  Justin"

184194,JustinHoffman,2008-04-09 01:56:00,482,"Well, three hats for $5 is a pretty good deal in my eyes...        Check out the catalog of gear - you might be surprised that it is not junky like you may think.  Yes, the rebate program is your best deal - but it runs out in 6 weeks. After that, it might be worth getting a couple of new ball caps or shirts up until December 31. Or, hang on to your UPC code and receipt and do nothing - your choice.  And everything you buy nowadays is some sort of promotional gimmick - from your Nike shoes to your Columbia jacket....and of course, your Shimano rod wraps.....something to keep in mind.  Anyways....thought some might be interested.  Justin"
184218,GbayGiant,2008-04-09 02:20:00,1780," Yes, I agree fully, consumers pay for marketing on everything. I wish everyone would just lower prices instead of giving out so called deals that you really payed for anyway. Bottom line the hats may be good but it's still free advertising in their eyes that's all I was getting at, not picking on you, just tired of the typical corporate America blueprints that Canada and the rest of the world eventually copy and the consumers loose every time."
184222,JohnF,2008-04-09 02:25:00,3494,"  I took the $50 on the Energy baitcaster, but I've got some other points banked from the Energy spinning reel I got last summer and with the points for the new Tour Edition rod I've got some to spend. I might as well get them to send me some of that advertising.  JF"
