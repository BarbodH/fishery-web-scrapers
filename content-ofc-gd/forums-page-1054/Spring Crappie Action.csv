This is not my favourite place to fish but sure beats sitting at home. Got there at around 12 pm and launched the boat there was a crowd of boats by a fallen tree but I decided to stay away from the crowd and find my own school of fish! Started fishing any kinds of underwater structure or cover I could find and in about 5 min we had our first crappie! The action stayed hot during the whole day, we caught 27 crappie and about 10000 small dinky perch and bluegill! Still fun to catch on a very light set up and was great way to start the soft water season! The place was suprisingly packed with people for a weekday don't even want to imagine what its like there on the weekend! Finished fishing at about 4 and headed home, overall not a bad day and I can't wait for annual G-bay pike opener trip May 1st (which will hopefully be in my new RANGER!!!)  Here is one of the many crappies we caught no real slabs but at least we got our target species!    "
184555,tbayboy,2008-04-09 21:56:00,1497,A weekday in a boat - who cares how big the fish are its a great way to spend the afternoon.  Scary to think of the crowds on the weekends if its still packed on a weekday
184559,Terry,2008-04-09 21:58:00,14456,it's great to get out on open water I was fishing there on the weekend

Good luck , and I might see some of you out there if the steelhead conditions get blown !!"
