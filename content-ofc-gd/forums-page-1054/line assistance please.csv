184115,goteeboy,2008-04-09 00:46:00,175,gotta go power pro. didn't mean to rhyme.
184120,muskymike,2008-04-09 00:48:00,772,"2Tone, I have the 300 series Curado with PP and its fantastic. It casts a mile."
184202,setomonkey,2008-04-09 02:01:00,872,I've got 20 lb PowerPro on my medium baitcasting setup for bass and walleye. Include a fluoro leader of similar diameter and you should have no problems.  Mike
184203,silveradosheriff,2008-04-09 02:05:00,1025,20-30 lb PP should do the trick!
184205,PickerelHunter,2008-04-09 02:06:00,100, Exact setup I use and it's been flawless for the species your looking for
184253,Rustic-Fisher,2008-04-09 02:58:00,826,Don't be afraid to go up to 40 lb braid on that Curado. RF
184259,Greencoachdog,2008-04-09 03:02:00,8163,I don't trust any braid with less than a 30 lb. test! It'll pay for itself with the lures you DON'T lose!

184462,LeXXington,2008-04-09 18:01:00,1928,  Got to second that!!!.  With no strech casting bigger baits one bad cast you watch you bait cast a mile without your line attached..
184469,Raf,2008-04-09 18:17:00,3495,"don't be afraid of going to 50# power pro on the curado.   that is what I use, it's my bass/pike setup. it's the same diameter as 12# mono.  for the muskie rods, 80 or 100#."
