184213,douG,2008-04-09 02:12:00,2693,"From the three of us, I had the only steelhead on the shore, mainly due to the superior shotting patterns I invented on the spot, and madd skilz with the float gear.      Does anyone still remember Percy?  This indeed was my first steelhead (a smolt or yearling?) and qualifies as my pb.  Lower case.  Someone also tagged a beauty whistle trout.  Those suckers always surprise me.  Thanks again to Cliff and Carole, always the best hosts, most generous and kind people.  "
184220,pigeonfisher,2008-04-09 02:21:00,696,"The mud on that fish, you should be disgusted with yourself.  If every fish were handled in such a way neither you, nor your peers will have the opportunity to catch them in the future...  I hope you are proud.  Next go for goldfish at the Mandarin."
184221,pigeonfisher,2008-04-09 02:23:00,696,I sure was laughing when I typed it.  Looks like a great day.  Never met Cliff and Carole but have enjoyed my time with Doogle!!!
184227,ccmtcanada,2008-04-09 02:33:00,7971,"I thought you called douG a fish Pigeonfisher, since he's the one with all the mud on him....LOL.  Had another great day douG...too bad the conditions sucked!  Hopefully we'll have some more time out there...gotta get you a new PB....I suppose there is only one way to go from there....up.....  Suckers in the tribs is a bad sign...action tends to slow down once they get in there.  Thanks again for the awesome sandwiches too...we should have you come on all our outings...at least we'll be fed well."

Is it your axe cologne, rugged good looks, suave verbage or just a large Timmies as seen in the background?  Do tell."
