184403,REBE,2008-04-09 15:40:00,5,"looks like i have the same unit - no screw head to look for, the entire ""hot"" or ""cold"" water handle screws on and off the base. Just unscrew the the smaller angled part of the handle as you did in your pic and then unscrew the entire unit off the base - sorry for the lack of proper terminolgy but a plumber I'm not!  Cheers!"
184468,Daplumma,2008-04-09 18:16:00,1961,"Moen Monticello.Unscrew the bulbous part from the handle,the spout prolly has a set screw.the whole thing will drop out of the bottom. http://www.moen.com/shared/pdf/T4560pt.pdf Joe"
184475,Roy,2008-04-09 18:42:00,13728,Joe!  Remind me to buy you a beer or two at Lakair! You're always there to help out!
184482,Headhunter,2008-04-09 18:58:00,5703,Allow me to buy the next one and the next one after that! Thanks so much for that! Much appreciated and will take a kick at it tonight! Thanks Joe! HH
184487,Jigger,2008-04-09 19:17:00,1237,Just saw this. Looks like Daplumma has you covered...
184856,Headhunter,2008-04-10 13:52:00,5703,"Thanks again to all who contributed to this thread and to all who PM'd me... new taps are installed, thanks again Will and the Warden is happy which means soon, I'll be happy! Thanks all! HH"
184880,fishnsled,2008-04-10 14:54:00,3520,"You're welcome Joe, anytime my friend.  Besides, who can say no to wings for dinner anyways.  lol  Thanks for the grub!   A special thanks to Daplumma is needed though.  With him coming up with the make and model I was able to come up with the installation instructions which made taking them apart a much easy task.  Thanks Joe!"
184883,goteeboy,2008-04-10 15:00:00,175,How does that joke go again???  I forgot the punch line.  How many OFNers does it take to pull off a bathroom faucet?????  OFNers are amazing in coming to one another's aid.
184886,Headhunter,2008-04-10 15:05:00,5703,"Actually Goteeboy, the question should be ""how many chicken wings does it take to change a faucet?""! HH"
184388,Headhunter,2008-04-09 14:44:00,5703,"Thanks to FnS for posting these, I really appreciate it Will! Cliff, I really like them too! But The Warden has changed the ""motif"" of the room and has decided that a brushed chrome look goes better with the new light fixture I installed as well as the other bathroom stuff like paper holder, towel holder etc... Cliff, even if I cut the cylinders, the plate pictured above them in the underneath shot will continue to hold the taps in place! I just may start to look around the house for my 5lb sledge! LOL HH"
184390,Gerritt,2008-04-09 14:45:00,6129,looks as though it has been soldered into place... Need to either apply heat and remove that Bar or cut them off.   G
184398,Nemo,2008-04-09 15:16:00,727,Hmm I have similar taps and I think you can undo them from the top. Try to unscrew/loosen the the part of the tap that sits on top of the basin. Mine have come loose and I have needed to tighten them down once in awhile. I think they have a counter thread.  Also they look like Moen call there service desk. I have used them before and they have been good.  Nemo
