We had the extra snowfall, so I imagine water levels wil be higher.  Just curious on thoughts of how this will affect the fishing...different tactics etc.  Much as I enjoy bass and pike fishing, hoping this is the year I finally snag some walleyes..."
184548,OhioFisherman,2008-04-09 21:48:00,6623,"High waters levels give more feeding and spawning places.Muddy fast running rivers can be bad for the spawn, silt can cover the eggs."
184602,MuddyWater,2008-04-09 23:25:00,218,from what ive been watching around here in bowmanville the silt is actually getting washed out nicley and their is new fresh gravel beds that the bows are getting it on in. as for walleye i havnt seen any around or heard of them running so im thinking they might be later this year gona be a interesting walleye opener!!

The ice melts faster than it comes in though, shouldn't be to far off schedule if it rains like it has been.  I'm hoping the waters higher than ever because it was lower than ever in November, I seen rocks out of the water that I didn't even know about.  It's going to be a late bite this year but they will bite.  As far as high water, nothing changes for catching fish, get your lure in the strike zone like usuall and keep it wet."
184624,MoriaRiverMan,2008-04-09 23:45:00,314,yes........they will  i may be able to sell my boat and just fish off deck ........or worse ............fish in basement !!!!!
