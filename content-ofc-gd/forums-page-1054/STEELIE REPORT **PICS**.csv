181715,Headhunter,2008-04-04 18:04:00,5703,"I'm starting to get that feeling again!  A guy posts some pics of some fish he caught and once again folks take it in a completely WRONG direction. Thanks for the report and please, don't let the little people stop you from posting in the future. HH"
181717,Roy,2008-04-04 18:06:00,13728,"Yeah, 4 posts and every one of them a complaint. I guess you don't  play well with others. It's quiet time now."
181728,Stoty,2008-04-04 18:16:00,2910," Funny, cause under your picture it says ""Newbie""......  LOL  I just dont get why people cant just be happy for other fisherman. You're not in a tournament, nor are you losing any money. Step off the high horses that you think you're on, grow up, be a man and say ""Wow, nice fish. Congrats""  If you know the spot, then I suggest you get out there, catch some fish and post your reports. Until then, zip it!"
181731,chickenhawk,2008-04-04 18:23:00,612,I apologize Roy! I let my thoughts get the better of me....
181738,Sebastian,2008-04-04 18:36:00,208,"The ""Newbie"" ranking simply means he doesnt post every fish he catches. Dont let message board ranking fool you. Its completely different on the rivers..."
181750,Stoty,2008-04-04 19:01:00,2910,"LOL, it was a joke...... hence the ""LOL"" after it."
181850,steverowbotham,2008-04-04 21:34:00,1800,"Sorry, not all dropbacks.  We each got nice fresh hens.  But the male was a dropback, and all the fish we lost were male droppies."
181875,Hookset,2008-04-04 22:01:00,367,"Nice fish Steve, very nice.  Looked like a beautiful day,Congrats. Keep posting.   Hookset"
181987,jdmls,2008-04-05 00:36:00,575," FROM YOUR DIRTY FISH PICS POST   HMMMMM...I take it you know it all about river fishing , as you state above......steelheading has been prime for about a month know and all I have seen is a post about ""your secret spots"" and ""losing count after 20""....yet not one pic of Steelhead or even one contributing some what helpfull tip to our members....Im not cutting you up, but more times than not , you seem to have something negative or sneaky to say like ""I know that spot don't tell anyone  HE HE HE, its all ours ""  in a # of steelhead reports this year.....you have already left somewhat of a bad taste in my mouth about your ethics , and it seems others are feeling the same way Do your self a favour , and make some quality report/posts ( even some nice pics would help)  to gain yourself some recognition atleast with the avid steelhead members around here.....  I give most respect to the guys who contribute as oppose to bash and make negative comments....I will admit ,that I  sort of got off the handle last week with Uncle Milty in BLY and CLIFF's post but he sorta had it coming. I do regret saying some of the things I said , as that's not what this board is all about. My apologies Uncle Milty , if you are reading.  Here's some members on this board who are the kind of people that get deserved respect  and that I can say have helped me out in the past......do as you please but learn some better ethics from reading their posts  CC , CLIFF&BLY , SOLOPADDLER, DMASSE , STEVE B, KEMPER, SILVIO... just to name a few   P.S..... If you take this as a hit, then sorry you took it that way, but this was not meant to start a back and forth cat fight with you.....just giving you some insite !! TAKE IT AS YOU PLEASE"
181995,muskymike,2008-04-05 00:43:00,772,"Great Job guys. Keep them coming.  I have not one clue about the Steelhead world. I wouldnt even know where to start. Dont know where to go, or what to use. Never had the chance to experience it. I am thinking about trying it though. These pictures make me want to get out.  Again great job, keep them coming. I need some more motivation to try for a new species.  This board has a few members I have seen all they do is bash. Not cool. Keep the pics coming and laugh at the rest. Pictures speak for themselves.  Looking forward to more in the future. As soon as the seasons start opening, I will get mine on here."
182026,ccmtcanada,2008-04-05 01:33:00,7971,Steve...keep posting the reports!  There are lots of us that enjoy them!
182148,kemper,2008-04-05 04:01:00,2232,Keep posting the reports!  Im working on some reports myself...trying to come up with a way to report without causing a stink and getting the thread locked...
182152,Cookslav,2008-04-05 04:12:00,1457,"Nice report and ""THANK YOU"" for shareing. I can't beleive all this static lately...  C'mon spring...melt, melt, melt, melt!!!"
182153,steverowbotham,2008-04-05 04:12:00,1800,"best way to not cause a stink = dont post reports.  i've been flamed all day by ""real steelheaders"" who are clearly way better and way cooler than me, because they dont post pictures.  And apparently floatfishing.net is so much better, yet they still feel the need to lurk and bash.  floatfisher, stealheader are way too cool for school.  MODS, close this thread please, I'm done with this"
182155,Cookslav,2008-04-05 04:23:00,1457,"Don't dispear Steve.  Moma always said, ""stick and stones""....errrr.....or was it ""their just jealous?"" Oh man its just like highschool all over again only my hair is shorter, and my eye are not red...the horror...the horror  Don't let 'em bug ya... They'll leave soon enough."
182156,kennyman,2008-04-05 04:27:00,737,"Just keep posting. If you stop posting they win. That's what they want by the sounds of it. By the way, posts like yours make me want to learn to flyfish (rod on the way). Posts like theirs make me not want to admit it. Steelheading need not be an elitist sport. We're all just catching fish here, aren't we?? What's with all the politics? Just ignore the crap Steve and post for those who appreciate your efforts and talent. Glad you're on my team bud."
184300,Guest FISHON!,2008-04-09 05:02:00,0,I went to that creek the following day. It was really good. I'll put up a late post tomorrow after fishing.
184308,solopaddler,2008-04-09 08:46:00,8605,Nice going Steve! Congrat's to the gf as well  .
184336,edmichit,2008-04-09 11:43:00,145,"Nice report, keep them coming"
180975,steverowbotham,2008-04-03 17:49:00,1800,"With high water, there's always gonna be a creek or two in their prime, went searching for a while this morning and stumbled upon a gem.  About 8 iches of vis, but the water was fast!!  Had a rough time landing fish, but still managed to go 3 for 6 but didnt get a pic of the smallest one, and Kelli went 1 for 3, all dropbacks.  Good day out!  Be safe though guys, the water is still high!        "

181342,Guest Floatfisher,2008-04-04 03:08:00,0,Ummm. Actually TONS of people know about that creek. Its no secret.
181398,jonnybass,2008-04-04 06:21:00,346," lol, OK since it's no secret, anyone mind letting me in on it?  If you don't want to post it here you can PM me if you feel more comfortable.  Much appreciated."
181665,steverowbotham,2008-04-04 17:12:00,1800,"Lets play a game then, this could be fun, PM me if you think you know the creek."
