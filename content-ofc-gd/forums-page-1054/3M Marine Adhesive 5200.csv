182644,icefisherman,2008-04-06 13:43:00,952,"Can someone tell me where can I buy a tube of the 3M Marine Adhesive 5200 (non fast cure) in tan color?  Having hard time finding it locally... West GTA/Mississauga/Oakville/Brampton/Milton would be ideal.  Thanks.  Cheers, Ice Fisherman"
182646,irishfield,2008-04-06 13:45:00,26272,Highly doubtful you're gonna find Tan colour Emil... CTC $16 a tube I believe.
182648,icefisherman,2008-04-06 13:50:00,952,"Waooo that was fast reply. Thanks Wayne! I was thinking of CT and didn't remember seeing it there....but then my CT store is very small and often lucks much choice...will check the Brampton one. The brochure says they make it in tan color....is it the hot one that sells fast and this is why you think it'll be hard to find the color?  Cheers, Ice Fisherman"
182652,irishfield,2008-04-06 13:54:00,26272,"No I just figure CTC only stocks white or black.. lol. Usually in the boating section.. and our store at least has the entire boating stock back out again. I""ve never used 5200... as I build floats with Sikaflex 1A. Not an easy item to find.. so don't try."
182654,tschirk,2008-04-06 13:56:00,261,"Try Westmarine in Oakville or downtown TO, Also try any marine store like Liesure Marine, Noah's, etc..."
182655,2 tone z71,2008-04-06 13:56:00,1311,"ive never seen tan lots of white or black around thou,CTC for sure and theres a West Marine in Oakville right they may have tan,what are ya 5200 ing down thats awefull stuff"
182656,icefisherman,2008-04-06 13:57:00,952,"Hmmmm Wayne you must have very good CT store as I've just called two large ones and both didn't know what I am talking about....can't find it on their web site either....seems like bit of driving today ;-)  Cheers, Ice Fisherman"
182659,irishfield,2008-04-06 13:58:00,26272,It's ALWAYS been on the shelf at CTC Emil..as long as I remember... but then again we are on Lake Huron here.....
182662,icefisherman,2008-04-06 14:02:00,952,"  Thanks Bud. I know that West Marine store and am regular customer there  Previous owner has drilled few holes here and there probably trying to mount different stuff and then took them off so I'd like to plug all those holes and since my Lund is Tan color I'd like to use the same color.  Well West Marine has it:  http://www.westmarine.com/webapp/wcs/store...mp;classNum=318  and they have the Tan color too but only in the large size 10 Oz for $19.99 hmmmm.....those guys always make lots of money from me  Cheers, Ice Fisherman"
182666,2 tone z71,2008-04-06 14:13:00,1311,HAHA dont worry they take my $$ as well
184549,irishfield,2008-04-09 21:48:00,26272,Emil.. if you didn't find it yet and want to call stores.. CTC stocks White. The 4200 fast cure product number is 79-0215-4 and the 5200 is 79-0216-2. Neither come up on the website.. but them's the numbers off the packages in the Midland Store.
184571,icefisherman,2008-04-09 22:21:00,952,"Thanks Wayne. Appreciate the follow up. I did find it in CT - the white small tube of the 5200. In the meantime I've tested few holes by using the Premium Construction adhesive I've been using around the house for years with great success. The best thing about it is it is the right tan color. I've used this same adhesive to glue my back yard gates posts 5 years ago and in -40 to +40 degrees summer and winter those posts have never moved a mm. So, anyhow...I've tested it on few holes on the boat and just checked on it today seems to be all dried and hard now and holes are filled up/ So I'll stick to it for now and finish all the rest of the holes I want to fill in.  Cheers, Ice Fisherman"
184583,MoriaRiverMan,2008-04-09 22:52:00,314,Try your local fastenal or maybe mcmastercarr online.  Fastenal sells alot more then nuts and bolts   and if local rep wont help you..........call belleville branch and talk to jeff  Derrick  (i have bought 3m products through them)
184589,douG,2008-04-09 22:58:00,2693,"Wow.  Youse guys are amazing, encyclopedic knowledge of glue, and everything!"
184594,MoriaRiverMan,2008-04-09 23:10:00,314,We have had glue reps in my company showing glue that is stronger than welds!!!!! ya.....blew my mind to.......  They actually glue buses together these days     (glue was called something like plexas or plexis)   amazing stuff!!!!!  rep glued a piece of flat bar to plate and i couldnt beat it off with large hammer!!!!  couldnt pry off either !!!  Also loctite has some really amazing glues aswell
184657,Zamboni,2008-04-10 00:41:00,235,Was reading on a US boating board Home Depot had tubes of 5200 on sale for $6 down there....$13-16 at marine stores. Check if your HD carries it.
184687,icefisherman,2008-04-10 01:29:00,952,"The small tubes I found in CT (white color) were 14.99 From what I see on the sites the riverman gave me:  http://www.fastenal.com/web/products.ex?N=...matchallpartial  http://www.mcmaster.com/  The 5200 is about half price in the US. Not sure what the shiping will be but those are good sites to know for future references. Thanks guys.   Cheers, Ice Fisherman"
