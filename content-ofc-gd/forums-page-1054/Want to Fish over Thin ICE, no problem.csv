140605,Dave Frasso,2007-12-08 02:40:00,20,Buy an Wilcraft  Don't look like much would stop this machine.  http://www.thewilcraft.com/photos.php?pic=25   Enjoy   .
140620,tapout,2007-12-08 03:53:00,166,"Thats quite a handy machine to have.  Wonder if I can store it on my balcony. lol  also your sign off message I think should read ;  ** Give a man a fish and he eats for a day, Teach a man to fish and he will sit in a boat and drink beer all day***"
140634,Guest lundboy,2007-12-08 04:09:00,0,Only thing missing is a an auger setup like a drill press...  I've been keeping my eye out for such a thing.
140662,joonmoon,2007-12-08 06:15:00,528,Wonder if that thing was tested on Simcoe last year when it was slushy with a crust on top. Yaaa sure it will pull itself out. I'd rather have an Argo for that price. GEEEEZ.
140688,Terry,2007-12-08 12:33:00,14456,I don't think it would handle much snow and no slush...so simcoe is out
140690,Fisherman,2007-12-08 12:52:00,7201,"Same one as last week, now unless we get a major case of global warming and the icemaking stops about ...Dec 26 each year, and, doesn't snow for the rest of the year, it's pretty much as waste of material. Put a rotary brush on the front and make it a street sweeper."
181269,Slyatv,2008-04-04 01:45:00,45,Well I seen that add And I bought one .. I live on Simcoe .. and I have used it everyday since I recieved it .. I've taken it up to Wiarton and Fished for Salmon on thin ice in the rain ... stayed dry.. four inches in places on Colpoy Bay . Simcoe is Wet and Slushy right now ...NO issues .. There's tracks For it as well a Pair and the axle has Posi-lok !
181271,Roy,2008-04-04 01:51:00,13728,"yeah, well...next December you can start posting again then. Thanks for all your advice this season."
181272,Fisherman,2008-04-04 01:51:00,7201,"You must have quite a few miles on it by now, so far so good, maybe it will have more followers."
181304,irishfield,2008-04-04 02:19:00,26272," Next December Roy... .there's still 20"" of ice on Simcoe from what I'm told."
181610,Slyatv,2008-04-04 16:03:00,45,Just Got in off the ice ... There's still 16 inches of good ice most places .. be careful around USED launch areas .. But walking out should still be safe for tonight ..   no pics cause there's guys that don't want to hear the commercial...    HA HA HA HA HA HA    I went fishing today and Stayed Dry .. ..Caught a few but wasn't there for dinner .. Didn't keep any 17-21 ft of water was best ..
181690,Cory,2008-04-04 17:42:00,170, I guess the guy who told you might have put a report up here too if he wasn't on the mod queue....probably not worth waiting for approval for his posts...  they were some nice fish though.
181693,Raf,2008-04-04 17:44:00,3495,first rule of fight club......
181743,Rustic-Fisher,2008-04-04 18:43:00,826,Tell me this is not going to turn into the SLYATV Wilcraft plug that happens  on every other board  :blahblah1:   LMAOL..... Does look like a neat machine though.  RF
181758,16 Footer,2008-04-04 19:15:00,191,If it breaks through on thin ice how do you get it out? Will it pull it's self out or do you stand on the thin ice and pull it out? You are stuck out there and in big trouble!
181906,cantermore,2008-04-04 22:42:00,49,"Do you have the ""track option"" on yours Sly, that looks really cool; much better than an Argo"
181999,JerseyDog,2008-04-05 00:51:00,190,"Yah, while it looks like a cool machine, what happens if you break through the ice and cannot drive it out.  You are kinda stuck."
182018,Dave Frasso,2008-04-05 01:22:00,20,"Here you go guys, I don't own one of these. I saw the link one day and watched the Video's of it...  http://www.thewilcraft.com/index.php  After the page comes up scroll down, all the sample video's are on the bottom right hand side of the page. There is 6 Video's in all.......................  Thought everyone would enjoy looking at them.  Time to get the boat out now.. Like in the morning, I have some upgrades to do.. it never ends.. :-)   Enjoy...   Dave  ."
184372,Slyatv,2008-04-09 13:55:00,45,"Well   If it drops thru the ice ... Then with proper manipulation the operator lifts the wheels ( which are studded) by moving to the front of the craft the 'balance'  then shifts and the Rear wheels can easily be Pressed by use of yer paddles onto the edge ...  if the edge breaks away again then the studs will ..or at least have ..dug in and pulled the craft towards the thicker ice..  Unlike any other machine ... the wheels can be 'lifted' so they can easily climb on the edge.. The studs will then dig in and pull itself out ... Keep in mind the controls for the machine are one handed and can be reached by the operator from much more than just the drivers seat... I have had mine 'stuck' in honeycombed ice..   I simply lifted the wheels and Pushed the machine with the paddles.... once the wheels Caught good ice it dragged the rest of the machine thru it ... The whole thing weighs less than 500 lbs and has a SMOOTH flat bottom to get unstuck. At one point I was thinking ... great now I'm gonna have to get wet feet ...   That would have been operator error.. The Paddles or push/pull pole is a nessessity But paddles are required on a boat anyway... I didn't order the tracks . But I will over the SUMMER ... Winter is a short 8 months away ...  So far I've taken it ""OFF ROAD"" some as well .. those 25 inch tires and studs Take you evrywhere .. Even when the front wheels are off the ground it keeps pushing , with the variating seating position of the operator this craft will GO ... nearly everywhere. CAN'T wait for a swamp run ... gonna get muddy I'll bet .... I'll take pics.. . Gonna float at least . Man I love this machine ...  Without this becoming a commercial ...
