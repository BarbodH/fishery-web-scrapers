Some ice might leave tonight with the water flow going down but with the warm temps the ice bridge is gonna start melting now and it will be unfishable for about a week or so!

183959,jonnybass,2008-04-08 21:50:00,346,"Just out of curiosity, into what month will there generally be good steelhead fishing in the whirlpool? Is it the same as the tribs?"
184056,charlied,2008-04-09 00:11:00,584,"I will keep you posted oldPhart, right up till friday night.  Just keep looking on here.  Johnny bass.....I have caught steelies in the whilrpool right up till mid June before, depends on how cold the water can stay.  Alot different than the little creeks as it takes longer for Lake Erie and the river to warm.  Late April right thru to mid May is the best thou.  Once all the ice from Lake erie and the niagara ice bridge are gone and Lake erie starts to warm up.   I usually get about 2.5-3.5 weeks of rest from Steelies to bass.  Hope this helps!"
