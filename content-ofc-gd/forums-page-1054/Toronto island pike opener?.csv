183197,ehg,2008-04-07 14:42:00,2666,"Hi, i was under the impression that Toronto Islands was in Zone 20 and pike opened on May 3rd. After reading the regs i noticed that 2 lines were allowed on Lake O including Lower Niagara, but it was noted that all other waters, Frenchmans Bay, Toronto Harbour, Jordan Harbour etc... were excluded.  So i became confused, is Toronto islands Zone 20 or Zone 16(which opens May 10th)? Thinking some wise person here could set this straight.  Thanks,  ehg"
183212,bucktail,2008-04-07 15:00:00,1857,It is the first saturday (3rd) the exclusion is for the 2 rods. only 1 rod allowed in those areas.   D
183229,ehg,2008-04-07 16:00:00,2666,"Thats what i figured, momentary lapse of confusion however. Can't wait for that time.  Thanks,  ehg"
183263,napjohn8,2008-04-07 17:14:00,46,i talked to the 2 MNR officails at the sportsman show zone 20 dude.
183293,snag,2008-04-07 18:04:00,1932,"Glad you asked EHG,  I was gettin' foncused too!  See you out there."
183297,snag,2008-04-07 18:08:00,1932,"Here's another question,  If I am in a canoe (or CCMT/Bly's boat - HINT HINT) in zone 20, are you saying that a single person can have 2 lines in the water?  I don't have my regs at work.  thx"
183322,ehg,2008-04-07 18:57:00,2666," Hi SNAG, the two lines allowed in Zone 20 only pertains to L Ontario(main body) and lower Niagara R.  It excludes Toronto Harbour, Hamilton Harbour, Frenchmans Bay, Jordan Harbour and the like. I'll just fish these areas with one line to play it safe.  Waiting for May 3rd....  ehg"
183486,snag,2008-04-07 22:53:00,1932,"Thanks,  I'm such a Wharf rat.  There are some spots close to shore that I did want to hit with the 'yak between Etobicoke and Oakville.  So I guess the size/type of the watercraft doesn't really matter.  Hmmmmm"
183499,highdrifter,2008-04-07 23:12:00,2534,"Oh that's all honky dory, does this mean the inner harbour is open on the 3rd?  Does this mean we can troll 2 rods at the spit Erik?  shes coming soon!  YEEHAW  HD"
184278,snag,2008-04-09 03:27:00,1932,"Bump,  Just curious about what the loogan above said.  I would love to rig the 'yak with 2 rods"
184383,ehg,2008-04-09 14:26:00,2666," Not sure about the harbour boundries as far as two rod usage. But being in a watercraft really increases pike hook ups down there many fold come May 3rd.  BTW, SNAG have you SNAPPED?  ehg"
184409,snag,2008-04-09 16:07:00,1932, I am at the end of my ladder
