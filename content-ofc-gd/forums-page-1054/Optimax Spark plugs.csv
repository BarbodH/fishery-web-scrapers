183863,rob v,2008-04-08 18:09:00,535,"I just bought a used opimtax 115 - the local mercury dealer (Hully Gully) quoted me a price of about $30 each - yes I doubled checked - $30 each.   They're an NGK plug (I don't have the exact plug number on me right now) and I've called everywhere else (napa, part source, batter supply etc) and no one has them nor can they get them in.  As much as I'd like to patronize my local business person I don't want to pay for his entire business !  Anyone have any ideas on where I might find these at a bit more reasonable cost ??  Thanks for the info."

183941,Fisherman,2008-04-08 21:20:00,7201,"Without going into gory details, there have been some horror stories about ""that"" dealer, friend of mine was one to suffer. I wouldn't send my worst enemy to that place."
184371,Fishn Technishn,2008-04-09 13:54:00,198,"Rob V, I know your pain!! I have been loking for plugs for my 2006 75 Merc Classic. The plugs that came in it new, are NGK BUZHW-2  and Hully Gully quoted me a price of $16.99 EACH These are Surface Gap plugs...kinda neat looking!  Well after a little research, these are hi-tech resistor plugs that suppress interference for your radio etc. I don't have a radio, so I did some MORE research and a NON-Resistor version( just drop the Z) is available for .....$5.99 each. I may buy some of these for winterizing & spring startup & then put the others back in.  If you need the resistor ones some CTC stores do carry them but the price is not pretty, approx. $27 for TWO, which means if you have a 3 cylinder as I do, you have to buy 4!!  Good luck and please let me know if you find a better source.  FT"

184429,Bernie,2008-04-09 16:58:00,3190, Did you find them Randy?
184465,rob v,2008-04-09 18:02:00,535,"My engine is a 2005.  I found them at a couple of spots on line (west marine) in the states $15-$16 each -  while I'm still saving money after adding $20+ for shipping I think I may wait until my next trip to Port Huron and just go into their store and pick them up there.  I checked at one more Mercury dealer and the price was similar.  So I guess I,ll have to pick some up the next time I'm in the states.   If anyone has any other ideas I'm all ears.  thx."
184557,Muskieman,2008-04-09 21:57:00,2472,Found 'em...18.69 each readily available....sent you P.M   Rob.
