184476,Casey123,2008-04-09 18:44:00,461,"I think this is just more fear mongering from Al Gore, David Shitzuki and his left leaning loonie tunes!"
184478,Greencoachdog,2008-04-09 18:48:00,8163,I'll start worring when climate change endangers sugar cane and Rum production!!!
184483,LeXXington,2008-04-09 19:06:00,1928,"Supply and demand..  ""hops"" gets worth more than corn. farmers will change..  Now if the price of Beer comes down when the price of the grain comes down???"
184506,kemper,2008-04-09 20:07:00,2232,"If there is one thing is this world that is certain its this...   WE WILL NEVER RUN OUT OF BEER.  People will do whatever it takes to continue producing beer, it is one of those products that many will go to great lengths to ensure the future of.  Priorities in order? you be the judge.  Just dont worry about running out of beer."

184533,wolfville,2008-04-09 21:04:00,396,"Reverse thinking (or whatever it's called). Global warming may make Canada warmer, then we'll grow whatever makes beer here in Canada, then we'll have cheaper beers here in Canada. Get ready to drink more (but don't drink and drive)."
184537,Gerritt,2008-04-09 21:22:00,6129,   I would have to be desperate to drink a Coors...... but it will do in a pinch!  Thanks Wayne!  G
184546,OhioFisherman,2008-04-09 21:43:00,6623,"Saw a piece on the news yesterday I think, corn, wheat, and one other grain`s prices were up a minimum of 250% since 2000, use of grain for ethanol is raising the price, and a lot more production planned.  Cold beer is nice once in a while, might have one this year,"
