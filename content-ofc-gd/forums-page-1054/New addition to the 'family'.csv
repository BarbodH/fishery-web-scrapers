183986,silveradosheriff,2008-04-08 22:47:00,1025,Acquired a new 12' as an upgrade to the 10' that I picked up off the board last spring (which will go up for sale in a few weeks). Kids were pretty excited with the new vessel which will receive its' maiden voyage for the pike opener in a local electric only lake - see you there young Jedi!  :-)   
183992,GbayGiant,2008-04-08 22:59:00,1780,Nice. Put a 70lber thrust on there you'll get it going 10mph.
183997,Gerritt,2008-04-08 23:04:00,6129,Rod....    We need to talk!  G
183998,fishindevil,2008-04-08 23:06:00,6254,"Nice new fishing machine !!!! those things are tougher than nails,and will handle some really serious water,and will go anywhere,and i think you should put a nice 55lb on that baby,and you will be all set...good-luck"
184005,silveradosheriff,2008-04-08 23:17:00,1025,She is powered by the first motor I ever purchased....a 1996 55lb Minn Kota.  Stronger....Longer!
184020,salmon,2008-04-08 23:32:00,334,"Hey SS Is that an aquamarine boat? Nice, looks like is has the alumnium floor. I just picked one up also 11 ft, now to get a trolling motor for it.  Jose"
184049,charlied,2008-04-09 00:05:00,584,someone was a good boy over the winter months...LOL
184144,silveradosheriff,2008-04-09 01:07:00,1025,Come on Charlie.....I'm ALWAYS a good boy!
184152,Gerritt,2008-04-09 01:15:00,6129,Did you buy the 880???  G
184158,silveradosheriff,2008-04-09 01:22:00,1025,Going to go with the 250 as I don't think the 880 is compatible with our chartplotters. I will confirm with Jos.
184162,Gerritt,2008-04-09 01:23:00,6129,  It is... but you need the 30.00 cable.....according to Jos... I am pretty sure.  G
184177,silveradosheriff,2008-04-09 01:35:00,1025,OK - but then I need to find three friends....
184299,jediangler,2008-04-09 04:50:00,1923,"That thing looks pretty cool man, it will be perfect for conservation areas. We'll have to make the rounds: Guelph, Shade's, Valen's, Wildwood, and Mountsberg. Are you trailering or just inflating on site?"
184338,silveradosheriff,2008-04-09 11:48:00,1025,"Initial plan was to inflate on site, but the damn thing is pretty heavy - combined with the fact that I'm a fat old man will most likely result in it being trailered.  :-)"
184452,jediangler,2008-04-09 17:45:00,1923,Do you have seats or do you just sit on the floor?
184456,Gerritt,2008-04-09 17:54:00,6129,Roof racks on the Audi!
184542,silveradosheriff,2008-04-09 21:31:00,1025," Comes with bench seats, but not sure if they can hold KR....      Gerritt, you behave!  :-)"
