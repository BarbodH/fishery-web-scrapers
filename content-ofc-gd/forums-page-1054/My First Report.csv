And i Mean it was a CRAPPY CRAPPIE DAY...lots of people..the first dock i went to was flooded..We fished it for a short amount of time, and we weren't catching fish, but neither were those on boats We then decided to switch over to another spot where there was quite a large number of cars parked and people. lots of folks had their boats out and ready to launch while we were on shore just casting along..still no bite for about 2 hours..called it quits after that, no fish to go home At least I got to go out though. Feels good to be back near the water to wet a line again"

Daughter and her boyfriend just got back from the farm pond out back, a couple bluegill and a couple crappie, crappie in the pond seem to be stunted from lack of a good bait fish supply, rare to see one over about 6 inches long.  Cold front predicted here for the weekend and into next week, it will probably slow things down even more. Snow?"
