184591,xrap,2008-04-09 22:59:00,683,Yes thier are channels in Lake O but if you really wana catch some big ones head to Dunnville. Pm Fimastr is you best bet.

Rotten meat works well, chicken livers get picked apart by gobies these days, so do worms. If you use chicken livers, leave them in the sun for a couple days then tie them in roe netting or pantyhose to keep the gobies from picking them apart.  Lasalle and Pier 4 park are good starting points.  But Xrap is right, Dunnville is a great place to get into a lot of bigger fish."
