183936,Rustic-Fisher,2008-04-08 21:16:00,826,"With the stellar day I had to head out for some more steel!!! Tribs are still on the high side and cold from the melt. Slow start in the morning but it soon picked up in the afternoon, caught good numbers but have to retrain my partner in the finer points of landing fish and not breaking lines with paws, grabbing at floats , chasing floats, eating roe, stepping on rods and at the very least not trying to help others land their fish.  LOL... But its always a blast for him when he gets out (thank god I did not bring the Cane Corso also) RF   "
183938,Bly,2008-04-08 21:18:00,1556,Your fishing partner is very good looking!   Glad to hear that you had another good day out there

183944,Rich Clemens,2008-04-08 21:29:00,3131,"I got the same problem with my two little helpers in the boat.   When we get one on ... everyone is hanging over the side of the boat to see what it is.   Once in a while my last Airdale got a little carried away and we not only had to get the fish out of the water, we also had to fish the dog out of the water.    They're great companions and good to see you taking yours out as well."
183947,Casey123,2008-04-08 21:32:00,461,"Great report, nothing better then a day on the water with your buddy.  Now if your friend out fishes you, then you need to get some help."
183977,steverowbotham,2008-04-08 22:24:00,1800,"oh man, i cant wait to get back out"
184060,Rustic-Fisher,2008-04-09 00:13:00,826,"Yep tough to keep them locked up, 160 lb OMG, my Corso's only about 125lb. He is getting older now so when fishing he just enjoys  sitting and watching everything, a welcome change from the Boxers antics. RF  "
184080,MoriaRiverMan,2008-04-09 00:28:00,314,I should actually weight him again soon.........  Might be more around the 170 mark........  and he's lean to  Hes only about a 20 months old to
184108,bpsbassman,2008-04-09 00:40:00,941,"Ryan, Nice to see your partner is better looking than you! "
184148,Beans,2008-04-09 01:13:00,3339,Hmmm...Reminds me of a friend's dog named Andy...      Nothing gets caught without his approval...
184160,Dozer,2008-04-09 01:23:00,896,"Dogs as fishing partners rule!  Spend days fishing with you, don't complain either!  I've got my moms little Dachshunds ( weiner dogs ) on top of that they're mini's too!  The male rocks to go fishing with, the female sun bathes most of the time.  Cane Corso's rule!  But the way, nice fish and Boxer"
184226,pigeonfisher,2008-04-09 02:32:00,696, Better than yours!!!    :thumbsup_anim:
