184733,FinS,2008-04-10 02:32:00,463,hey guys just wondering if there is a way to test an outbouard without it  being in the water thanks and happy fishing  Ren
184736,Maverick,2008-04-10 02:46:00,371,"You can get a thing that looks like ear muffs that you hook a hose up to and run it, just have to have it on a bracket or boat or something but the muffs work well, let's the water flow through the motor. They are at CT in the boat section, pretty cheap."
184739,Dondorfish,2008-04-10 02:48:00,1000,I presume that when you say test - you mean run? P ick up a set of mufflers from CTC or Walmart and put them over the water intake on the bottom end - hook a garden hose up to them and turn the water on. You should have water coming out the discharge tube - if all is ok - start motor.   Don     *Note - Maverick types faster then Tracker - LOL

184749,LundGuy,2008-04-10 03:02:00,169,"With proper earmuffs you can run some small motors. You must also make sure you only turn the water on half full, never full. But the best way is in a barrel of water."
184751,2 tone z71,2008-04-10 03:15:00,1311,ya got a set or pic of these proper muffs for the smaller hp id love to find a set that would work for the rear port intakes on the smaller engine short of taking of the brass end of the hose and jamming it in there
184767,LundGuy,2008-04-10 03:45:00,169,"I don't have a pic, but I do have a set that I use on my 9.9 with no problems. My buddy at the marina got them for me. My bother-in-law has em right now. Its how I run em first thing every spring. They are small rectangle in shape.Just run the water slow, no problem. I use the round ones for the bigger motors."
184770,2 tone z71,2008-04-10 03:54:00,1311,"yep 9.9s have the small side intakes no prob there ,Im refering to small Hp engines 2-8 hp"
184774,LundGuy,2008-04-10 04:08:00,169," ahha when you originally said smaller motors , I assumed 9.9 was smaller. Now you make sense and so do I.   Most those little guys just need a motor stand and away you go.I had a 5 HP Honda and had to barrel it."
184790,Dondorfish,2008-04-10 09:48:00,1000,I use the full size muffs on my 8 HP Evinrude with no problems - works great.   Don  
184794,lew,2008-04-10 10:58:00,12767,"I had a 6 HP Merc kicker and couldn't get muffs for it either, but it was small enough I could just hang it off the homebuilt motor stand and place the lower end in a 5 gallon pail and that worked fine."
184797,ccmtcanada,2008-04-10 11:15:00,7971,I use one of our rubbermaid garbage containers...just filled it with enough water to cover the intakes.
184817,Billy Bob,2008-04-10 12:48:00,5865,"I don't know if this is a concern with all outboards but I have a 1985 50hp VRO Johnson outboard that I always run in the driveway in the spring before my first time out. I use the ear muffs but the motor always runs rough because it needs back pressure that the ear muffs cannot provide. The first time I did this I called the dealer up and told him how bad it was running in my driveway (brand new at the time) and he explained to me about the needed back pressure.  BTW 23 years later and the only thing I have done to this motor is a new impeller as a preventive maintenance repair. Oh, and add gas and once a year oil to the 2 gallon reservoir. This is been one hell of a outboard for me"
