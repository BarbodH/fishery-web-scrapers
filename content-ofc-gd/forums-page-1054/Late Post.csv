184298,Guest FISHON!,2008-04-09 04:49:00,0,I guess better late then never. About a week ago I read a report made by Muddy Water and realized he had a SLAMMIN day at Bowmanville so I called my buddies up and arranged an outing the following day. The next day we got to the river and one of my buddies realized he forget to pull the battery out of the charger for the camera  I can't believe out of 6 of us non of us had a digtial camera. It was a slammin day for us but no real good photos to show for.  Anyways here are a few photos taken with our crappy cell phones.  Looking forward to more Muddy Water's post !!!
