I have had the pleasure of helping some folks here with their job interview questions, their resume, job searches and what not... but I still feel to this day that I get way more back from the good folks here, then I can possibly ever pay back. I just wanted to say thanks to all who made the effort to help me out on my plumbing problem, but also to everyone whether we've connect in person, through PM's or what ever, for making this such a great place to spend time. I hope I can give back more than I get, but I somehow doubt it! Guaranteed, I'll try! Thanks! HH Ps... I know I'm gonna hear about this thread, but go ahead and take yer shots... WAYNE!LOL"

Gerritt... well I've been fortunate enough to have met Roy twice and TJ and Monique once, a couple of years ago at the fishing show. I'd hug Roy but I think I'd miss!
