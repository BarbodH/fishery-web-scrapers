Jeez...just thinking about it....oh wait...sorry Glen.....  Blurry pics suck, but at least now I can sympathize with you!!  Good to see you getting out there on shore!"
183782,Jen,2008-04-08 13:33:00,833,"Nice catch, and ouch on the rod and blurry picture...  It seems whenever you catch something you really want to show off that happens...  Your smile says it all though...  Thanks for sharing  Cheers,  Jen  Those birds are amazing..."
183783,Joey,2008-04-08 13:34:00,9122,"Great report G.  Sorry about the rod, but they'll replace it and then you'll have a shiny brand new one  Cool bird nest pics.  Joey"

183792,Roy,2008-04-08 14:08:00,13728,Thanks for the report and super pics Bud. What's that structure next to your right elbow in the first two spot pics? Water looks pretty clean too. Too bad about the Crucial but it'll surely be replaced.

183952,jonnybass,2008-04-08 21:38:00,346,It must be nice to be able to fish for bass at this time of year!
183953,oldphart,2008-04-08 21:40:00,665,"~~~What you broke a rod, heck be like us just get a roll of the Handie-Man Friend and tape it up, it'll be as new, and I hope that sun burn hurts"
183958,tbayboy,2008-04-08 21:49:00,1497,At least it broke on a fish and wasn't run over or caught in a door or anything like that.  At least she gave it up for a good cause I say and now we get to learn how well the Shimano warranty works I guess.
183979,Tarzan's Jane,2008-04-08 22:29:00,1183,"What's a nu-nu?  Looks so pretty where you are....sigh*  Nice fish, nice pics...bet ya Ole Yeller wasn't too happy about your rod...hope she yelled really loud at ya.  lol  Thanks for sharing."
183984,Bernie,2008-04-08 22:38:00,3190,Them there Crucials just don't stand up!. Mine wouldn't even take a slow moving ceiling fan.    Fortunately it was only a couple inches off the end. It still works great. I really like the rod.
