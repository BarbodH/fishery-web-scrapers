184611,Live2Fish83,2008-04-09 23:33:00,26,I am planning to buy an suv for the summer and the 2005 mazda tribute looks like a good option...i wanted to ask if anyone owns one or whose driven one to give me some info on it cuz everyone i ask doesn't really know anything bout this car!   ( some info i really need is if the car brakes are  parts cheap)?      Thx!

184700,goteeboy,2008-04-10 01:57:00,175,i believe it's basically the same car as the ford escape suv. i'm not sure if that helps or not.
