183844,jdmls,2008-04-08 17:18:00,575,"  FIGURES....he deserved it , being the only one of use that hadn't given up to shoot the C H I T......i walked around the corner. made 2 drifts snagged bottom , broke everything off , reeled in and called a day !!!"
183846,jdmls,2008-04-08 17:21:00,575,  nice post pal....PS think about changing your name as people are confusing you with a well known / well liked member with the same name...
183872,snag,2008-04-08 18:23:00,1932,"The crome really highlights the lush, candy-red nail polish,  and your eyes    Happy b-day again!"
183937,Bly,2008-04-08 21:17:00,1556," LOL , thanks for the upgrade!   I think there has been a misunderstanding, Cliff caught a sucker   Thanks SNAP"
183946,jonnybass,2008-04-08 21:31:00,346," Was I talking to you ""pal""? ???  Do you even know what spam is?  I'm letting the OP know about the action at that spot the day before, not sure what you're PMSing about.  Nice hat."
184022,jdmls,2008-04-08 23:39:00,575," Well I could of made a smiley with a little man waving a sign that said useless post but I didn't have the time..figured you would get my point.....next time just fill in the whole name of the creek....your *I**** was pretty obvious... Not that I mind you doing it,  but some people don't like it when you reveal locations in posts....especially when you say  ""I've never seen so many fish caught in one spot. It was a steel massacre ""    I luv that hat...What were you wearing on your head in that last pic you posted ? Ohhh wait that's right you haven't made a post with any pics yet.. right right, sorry my bad.....Maybe one day you will make a positive contribution as opposed to  useless one's.  change your name please and thank you  Sorry Carol for hacking up your B-day post....hopefully he doesn't carry on and gets my point...."
184196,jonnybass,2008-04-09 01:58:00,346," You could have just said that politely or even PM'd me, instead of flaming on someone else's report thread.   I'm also sorry Carol that he hacked up your B-day post. I didn't mean to bring the angry flamers out of the woodwork with my post. Just trying to be helpful. I thought you'd appreciate the info, that's all."
183375,Bly,2008-04-07 21:12:00,1556,"I got a PM from Canadiancopper saying that for my birthday, he'd like take me fishing for some chrome!  I scrambled to make arrangements for watching the children and I was all set.  It's always a learning experience fishing with him...my only instructions were to tie up some roe bags.  We met at 7am and headed to trib number 1.  Conditions were high and muddy, but we decided to try a few drifts anyways.  We tried a few different spots, but decided that we wouldn't waste a whole lot of time here.  Back to the car and off to trib number 2.  Conditions here were better...waters stained and windy!  We start drifting when I spy some structure.  On my second drift, the float goes down and I start a tussle with a fair sized male steelie.  Once it was landed, it was pretty feisty and I barely got a chance to take a pic before it squirmed a little to much and made it's way to the water.  My camera took a strange pic, but I know....no pic, no proof....well, here it is....and I swear, I didn't use photoshop.   A while later, I was aiming to drift by some structure again and after a few attempts at getting it where I wanted, my float goes down.  CC at this point was pretty far from me when I landed it, but someone who was close by was nice enough to take this pic for me.   CC did pretty well too.....landing a few himself....     All in all, had a great day out there as usual with CC.  It's always a learning experience when I spend time with him out on the tribs.  Thanks CC...it was a great birthday present....maybe next time you'll catch some bigger fish....LOL.  (I know you let me catch the bigger ones because it was birthday....right?)"
183400,Roy,2008-04-07 21:46:00,13728,"Great report, Carole. Congrats to you and Scott for the super day out there.  ps. That first fish could use a little colour. Was it caught on the Grand?"
