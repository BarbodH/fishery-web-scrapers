93941,glen,2007-07-14 16:05:00,2641,What radios should i get?  Crappy tire has ones on sale for $90.  What about marine radios?  Thanks for any help.
93959,taper,2007-07-14 19:06:00,611,If you are talking about VHF radios I would stick with quality names. I have a Uniden Solara and it seems pretty good.

93986,aplumma,2007-07-14 21:56:00,6896,Name brand...high wattage and a GREAT antenna. The hand held units are more for near shore fishing trips but even the best unit is less effective than a no name short antenna boat mounted unit. I have over a 9 ft antenna base unit  on the big boat just in case I need help on the water.   Art
