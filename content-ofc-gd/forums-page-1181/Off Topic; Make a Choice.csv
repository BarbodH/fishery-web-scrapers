93626,Bcee,2007-07-13 12:46:00,25,Neil Young or Rush??  I choose good ole Neil
93629,tonyb,2007-07-13 12:52:00,1637,Neil all the way...
93637,Raf,2007-07-13 13:21:00,3495,neil
93641,Whopper,2007-07-13 13:34:00,2174,Shania  Actually Neil is one of my all time favorites but the Twain is a lot easier on the eyes
93644,Bcee,2007-07-13 13:55:00,25,  When did Shania sing for Rush???
93647,BITEME,2007-07-13 14:12:00,1969,GODDO!!!!!!!!
93652,Headhunter,2007-07-13 14:37:00,5703,"Teenage Head!LOL As I have a real personal problem with ""speech impediment rock"" I simply can't get past Neil's tone deafness! He's a great song writer, but his voice and pitch leave just too much to be desired! Turning into a Finger Eleven fan as I was just given their new album and it is really quite good! HH"
93654,Joey,2007-07-13 14:41:00,9122,"Has to be Neil for me.  Old Man look at my life, I'm alot like you were...  Cinammon Girl  Ohio  The list goes on and on, love his songs.  Joey"
93655,John,2007-07-13 14:54:00,2956," Agree HH, although I must admit to listening to a lot of Neil's stuff...  Actually I know Finger Eleven quite well. My daughter is really good friends with the band. For an old guy I quite like their music..  John"
93660,oxcowboy,2007-07-13 15:03:00,544,"""I hope neil young will remember, a southern man don't need him around any how!"" i like a few of his songs but im gonna have to go with rush on this one, since shania isnt a choice.  jason"
93665,spanky,2007-07-13 15:15:00,195,"don't know alot of either, but much prefer Rush... tho i'm not even close to being of their ""generation"" of music... like the others, i like the rainbow butt monkeys, i mean finger eleven aswell..."
93669,carp-starter,2007-07-13 15:25:00,253,Oh my gawd ----------- NEIHER.  What brought this out? Is the full moon out today?  carp-starter
93670,Hookset,2007-07-13 15:25:00,367,Neil Young for me.....Geddy Lee's (sp) voice drives me nuts. Sounds to me like he got something stuck in his zipper.  Corb Lund is my current favorite though. I know it don't count.   Hookset.
93745,blaque,2007-07-13 19:52:00,2419,"Rush.........geddies voice is the lesser of the two evils LOL. they both have many similarities though.......there voices are both terrible, yet somehow they have countless hits........there arrangements and sounds are both unique, they both have a face only a mother could love, and their both the cheapest dressed millionaires Ive ever seen hehe.  Seriously though, there are some Rush songs that I just LOVE ,  small percentage, but the ones i do like i REALLY like!! I cant say that about Neil. Crank the guitar solo from La Villa Strangiato (Rush) on a quality stereo system and if you dont get goosebumps.......check your pulse."
93746,Raf,2007-07-13 19:56:00,3495,dayglo abortions all the way.
93778,Rizzo,2007-07-13 20:51:00,4754,"teenage head, no means no, spirit of the west had that timeless drinking song (Home for a rest)so have to give them some credit, in my opinion, maybe the best song ever by a canadian artist"
93780,lookinforwalleye,2007-07-13 20:59:00,4399,"Young and Rush are great talents, but I like Kim Mitchell imho he is a under rated talent."
93785,snackpack5150,2007-07-13 21:28:00,79,Rush and I guess it all depends on your age!!!!!   
93793,motv8tr,2007-07-13 21:55:00,2587,Rush!  so now what does that say about my age???  Maureen
93795,ecxstriper,2007-07-13 21:57:00,343,Neil and Nickleback
93871,Motorhead,2007-07-14 02:03:00,163,"Between Rush and Neil, I`d have to go with Neil.... I really like the Hip and Big Sugar as well..."
