93005,Joey,2007-07-11 18:27:00,9122,"  Well I'll take it off your hands then Verno  I thought of the regulator, but it worked fine before I changed the burner so I don't think its that.  I'm going to start with the burner to see if I bought the right one first and go from there with everyone's suggestions and Gerritts kind offer to help.  I'll keep yous updated.  Thanks  Joey"

93137,danc,2007-07-11 22:44:00,4677,"Joey, I've changed many BBQ burners in my time. The last one was about a month ago. As other have suggested, I'm sure that you have an air mixture problem. You're not getting air into the burners, hence the orange sooty flame. It's very important to make sure that the propane outlets, attached to the BBQ, fit nicely into the receptacles on the new burner. If they are pushed too far in, you've cut off your air supply to the fuel mixture. Mind you, if you purchased the right replacement burner and installed it properly, that shouldn't happen. The propane outlet attached to your BBQ should sit freely into the inlets on the new burner. They really should not be touching anything. You should have a set screw for adjusting the fuel/air mixture. Find this and open it up wide open (so you can see the most of the inlet) and try lighting the BBQ. This will supply you with the maximum air to the fuel mixture, which may not be ideal, but should give you a roaring blue flame. From there you can dial it in to give you a nice flame as described in your new burner installation manual. If this doesn't work, just drop it by my house and I'll have it running tip top in no time."
93157,Joey,2007-07-11 23:42:00,9122,"Okay, I went to the store and that is the standard BBQ burner they sell for all BBQ's.  It says for most gas BBQ's, so I'm assuming that means propane.  Bucktail, the BBQ is a Broil-Mate, with a back warming burner and a side cooking burner as well.  Dan, I did what you said, save for the screw adjustment as there wasn't one.  Still big orange flame, and when I turned it down to a smaller flame, it just went out and I don't think that's right either.  I'm stumped and almost ready to heave it.  Thanks  Joey"
93160,danc,2007-07-11 23:52:00,4677, Get the right one for your model and I'll bet that you'll be cooking up a storm in no time. Make sure that your make and model # is on the box. I don't see how there can be a generic burner for all BBQ's. That should be illegal in fact because it's dangerous.
93170,Corey,2007-07-12 00:15:00,355,"I bought the cast iron generic at CT and it is just that, the piping going down to the valves is flexible and it works great. Weighs a ton, but was only 30 bucks and works wonderfully.  cd."
93231,rapala14,2007-07-12 02:50:00,44,"ahhh the ol' BBQ  is acting up...  my advice, do exactly what DanC said.  take your make and model number into whichever hardware store you go to, they'll bring out a little book (i think its pink this year if i'm not mistaken) and they'll order you the exact burner that was meant for your BBQ.  its soooo much easier installing something that is meant to be there.  generic burners can work, but like DanC said not the easiest or safest things to deal with.  when all else fails, bring'er to ol' Gilmer's Homehardware in good ol' port hope... and i'll install it for ya!"
93725,Joey,2007-07-13 19:01:00,9122,Expensive lesson learned - see original post.  I've updated it.  Thanks all and have a great weekend.  Joey
93731,tonyb,2007-07-13 19:15:00,1637," I am really starting to get ticked off with companies' refund policies.  I recently bought (shopping with the wife earns mega brownie points  ) a curtain rod from BouClair and they wouldn't take it back without the receipt.  The item was their own, meaning it is branded with BouClair on the box and I was returning it less than 24hours from when I purchased it and it hadn't been opened.  It was even the same dang cashier that sold it to me telling me it wasn't possible.  I was really ticked.  We are just settling into the new house and trying to keep things organized and tidy while doing so, so little pieces of paper tend to go missing easily.  I finally found the receipt and was I ever glad to take it back and get my money, letting them know I will no longer shop there EVER again.  Add to that an EXPIRED $100 Canadian Tire gift card, Expired TryThat.ca gift certificate ($500) and a Home Depot card that I can't get change from (bought something for $43 on a $50 card, now there is $7 remaining) why can't they just give you the cash change?!  Since when does money EXPIRE!?  Sorry for the rant, I had to stop typing when I realized how long this was getting  Tony"
93738,Joey,2007-07-13 19:39:00,9122,"No problem Tony, I hear ya.  I think they outlawed that ""gift card expiry"" thing.  You should look into that.  Joey"
92598,Joey,2007-07-10 19:57:00,9122,"Our BBQ was not working up to par and was dirty, so I cleaned it all up, took the old element out and bought a new one ($45) and replaced it. Now everything I cook gets all black and sooty and doesn't taste all that good.  I wrote to an internet BBQ expert site and they said that if my flame was orange instead of blue the propane was not getting enough oxygen and to adjust the hoses.  We adjusted and readusted and nothing is making a difference.  My next step is to trash the BBQ and buy a new one.  So this is my last kick at the can before tossing the BBQ out.  Anyone have ANY ideas I can try before I do that.  Thanks in advance.  Joey   ** I talked to the manufacturer of the ""universal"" replacement burner I bought, who have just been bought out by another company as they're going down.  I was told by he new company that if the flame is orange/yellow at the get go, there is no way to fix it on my make and model of BBQ.  They said take it back (need the bill tho, which I don't have) to the place of purchase and get a refund.  He says these universal burners work with some BBQ's and not others.  Guess mine is one of the others   .  The manufacturer replacement burner for my bbq model is only $37 so I think I'll just go get that (the universal was $45   ).  Anyhoo, thanks everyone, I really appreciate the comments and suggestions and it was definately an oxygen problem, it just can't be adjusted with my model of BBQ.  Happy Grilling  Joey"
92599,Squid,2007-07-10 20:01:00,1656, What color are the flames Joey?
92603,muskymatt,2007-07-10 20:05:00,2608,"Make sure the tubes are not inserted too far into the ports at the connection at the controls , if they are you will not get the flow of gas cause you will choke the flow.....this sound like what you are having"
92610,Headhunter,2007-07-10 20:11:00,5703,"Yup... what musky Matt said... if the burner is pushed up too far into the valves, the bbq is being starved of air flow and your just burning propane as opposed to oxygen and propane. Try moving the burner away from the valves and the try adjusting the oxygen breathers to get a blue flame! HH"
92613,Greencoachdog,2007-07-10 20:16:00,8163,"Been there done that Joey!  You've prolly got spiderwebs in your vents. Look between the on off knob and the burner (follow the fuel line) you should see a small port on the route, clean/blow this out with compressed air and your grill should start working like new again."
92633,Joey,2007-07-10 21:16:00,9122,"The flame is orange Pete.  And G, we already blew out the lines for spider webs.  Muskymatt and Joe, we tried the lines further down from the ports and the flames started coming out of the bottom of the BBQ?  That doesn't seem right.  I guess I could try again, but we've pretty much put them in every position from all the way up to just near the end, to no avail.  Just don't know what to do now.  Joey"
92636,Greencoachdog,2007-07-10 21:24:00,8163, ... take a 20 oz. steel shank claw hammer and......
92638,lew,2007-07-10 21:27:00,12767,"Joey, your definetely not getting enough oxygen to the flame and that's why it's burning orange rather than blue.  You probably just don't have the new burner positioned correctly, take it out and re-position it again and you should be cookin in no time.  Some times they can be a bit tricky to get in properly."
92639,gussser,2007-07-10 21:27:00,85,Remove gas bottle & toss in nearest lake. These make great structure for future fishing trips.
92642,Daplumma,2007-07-10 21:34:00,1961,Sometimes they have a safety built into the regulator so that if too much gas gets thru it shuts it down to a low setting.Make sure you shut off the burners and then turn on the tank.Then open the burners up.Hope this helps. Joe
92684,Carp,2007-07-10 23:52:00,1488,What Joe said.
92717,Joey,2007-07-11 01:19:00,9122,"Okay, these suggestions are good.  Joe, I noticed that compared to the old burner, this one makes the flames absolutely huge.  They go far higher and burn way hotter than the last one.  There is no way I could leave it on high now to burn off the old stuff left on the grill.  When I turn on the gas from the tank, then turn on the burners after that onto high to light it, the flame really comes out of there and is way louder than before.  You have to turn it down right away or its really, really hot.  Does that give any more help with what might be wrong.  Maybe you're right Lew and I'll have to take it all apart and reposition the burner?  Thanks All.  Joey"
92718,Roy,2007-07-11 01:23:00,13728,"Joanne, I think that either Lew or Joe (or both) have the answer.  There's another thing you might want to look at. Have you got a second tank? Try IT. Sometimes, if there's air in the tank, it won't feed properly...need to get in purged when you get it filled up."
92720,Gerritt,2007-07-11 01:34:00,6129,"Joey, I work close o Richmond Hill.... within 15 minutes on the 407... I also happen to be a BBQ master (no degree mind you) I would be more then happy to stop by and help out.  Gerritt."
92732,Joey,2007-07-11 01:47:00,9122," Awesome Gerritt, whenever is easiest for you I live near Yonge and 16th Ave.  I come home for lunch every day so if that's convenient let me know.  Roy, you may have something there.  I bought the new tank when I got the new burner, so I didn't use this tank when the BBQ was working with the old burner when it worked properly.  Hmmmmmmm.  And Clamp-it, a $98 BBQ with be just that, a $98 BBQ  Joey"
92746,Corey,2007-07-11 02:16:00,355,"Any chance you bought a natural gas burner? The orifaces (burner holes) on the NG are bigger than the propane ones, would not get the nice tight burn you need for the blue flames.  cd."
92754,Gerritt,2007-07-11 02:23:00,6129,a NG connection would not connect to a Propane Tank brother   Gerritt.
92755,Gerritt,2007-07-11 02:25:00,6129,OK Joey I'll give yah a shout this week  Gerritt.
92758,Joey,2007-07-11 02:32:00,9122,Thanks hon  Joey
92780,bucktail,2007-07-11 03:01:00,1857,Make and model of the BBQ?  My wife's specialty is BBQ's and fireplaces. I am sure she can fix it for you.  D
92907,Guest lundboy,2007-07-11 14:57:00,0,"  It is possible you picked up a replacement burner for a natural gas BBQ.  The hookup to the fuel source is irrelevant in this case because you have only replaced the burner with maybe a NG type.  Have a good look at the package for it if you still have it, it might say natural gas.  If this is the case it won't work with propane.  Trying to pass propane through a NG burner will fly through because of bigger holes in the NG burner."
92919,Bcee,2007-07-11 15:17:00,25,"If all else fails, buy a Weber.  I've had mine 18 years (propane) and my Smokey Joe (Weber charcoal) for 20.  Never had a issues with either.  Hope you do not need to go down that route."
92925,Joey,2007-07-11 15:36:00,9122,"Lundboy, that may be the case.  I'll have to go look to see if I have the package.  The holes do appear larger.  I know where I bought it so I can go look at the package at the store if I didn't keep it.  I'll report further.......  Thanks  Joey"
92928,Gerritt,2007-07-11 15:43:00,6129,Sorry I thought Corey meant the actual gas hookup. Not the burner.... it is entirely possible....   Gerritt.
92937,verno,2007-07-11 16:15:00,178,Last year I had probs with my Q.  I thought it was the burner that was plugged up.  Cleaned everything really well.  Bought a brush and brushed out the lines.  But always had the same problem.  It would burn really hot for about 15 mins and then slowly the flame would die off to nothing.  I ended up buying a new regulator hose for $20 and havent had any problems since.  Of course the doc put me on a vegetarian diet for 3 months so I haven't had any need for the Q lately
