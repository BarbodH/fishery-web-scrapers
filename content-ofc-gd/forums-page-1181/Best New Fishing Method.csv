93937,English,2007-07-14 15:49:00,90,Steady on Neil not everyones on the same sarcasm level as you and I matey. Some American states you can shoot carp with guns out side the city limit or summat like that or you could try Afganistan style fishing  http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=kg4bcaIXKHU  Regards Clive
93938,Anatz,2007-07-14 15:59:00,74,Isn't bow fishing illegal in Canada? I kinda find it cruel..especially if you release it back into the waters..but I guess it's OK down south since carps are invasive species.
93947,lunkerbasshunter,2007-07-14 17:22:00,2585,interesting for sure.  i rather fish the oldfashion way myself.  cheers!
93994,fishindevil,2007-07-14 22:30:00,6254,"WOW!!!!!!!!! that looks like alot of fun,where can i sign up for that,they should make killing them mandatory...lol..lol... great video,thanks for sharing that    cheers"
94047,Rizzo,2007-07-15 02:05:00,4754,"thats a neat video.  The number of those carp flying through the air in some scenes is pretty scary.  I'd say shotgun would do a better job, although the whole bow and arrow thing is a better challenge"
