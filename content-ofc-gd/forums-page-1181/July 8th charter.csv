I did manage however to get out on a charter, I took my parents my wifes parents and my wife and son out of Erieau with Trophy Taker Charters. Once again I was completely impressed with the quality service we received from Jeremy. We were a bit late and my mom had a little trouble with the waves so I decided not to tourture her any more and call it a day early so we only fished about 4 hours total. In that 4 hours we did manage 17 walleye and 5 rainbows and a whole lot of fun. It was a great day on the water and i can't wait till next weekend to get back out with the guys from work on another charter with Jeremy.I only got this one picture back at the dock the waves were a little to big to have the camera out on the water.
