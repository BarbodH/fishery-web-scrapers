94002,engle,2007-07-14 23:02:00,1,Hi Folks  I used to come on a few years back but can't remember my name at the time...oh well.  Can anyone tell me if there has been any logging around the confluence of the East and West Aubinadong out Ranger Lake way?  Been about 4 years since I was up that way.  Thanks
