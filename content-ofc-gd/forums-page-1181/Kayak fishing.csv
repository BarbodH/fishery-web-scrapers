I'm going to try shock- cording a box in front of me ( if the yak is stable enough). You guys have done a lot more of this type of fishing, any thoughts on the subject?  "

I removed a rod holder that I had mounted on the front of my sit-in-kayak because it was always catching my line. The problem with mounting anything behind you is it's hard to reach. If you get it worked out, post some pics so we can see your solution."
