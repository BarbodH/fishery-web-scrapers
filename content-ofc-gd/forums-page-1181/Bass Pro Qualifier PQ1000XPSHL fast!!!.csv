93548,silvio,2007-07-13 02:39:00,433,Well on ebay today i was out bidded on this reel. I got a second chance at it has anyone used it before? If so what do you think about it. This would be my first bait casting reel.  
93550,lookinforwalleye,2007-07-13 02:58:00,4399,I have never used one before but I am curious what the bid price is and why for your first baitcaster you would pick that reel?  It would not be my first choice.
93551,silvio,2007-07-13 03:01:00,433,I can pick it up for 42 cdn  including shiping. what do you think get it or not i am not comited this it is a second chance. Forgot to add 6 bearings.
93560,Dutch,2007-07-13 03:38:00,831,Sometimes second chance offers on e-bay are not legit.  I would contact the seller (through e-bay) to ensure they are really offering you a second chance.  Seems like a good deal if it is legit.
93584,misfish,2007-07-13 09:55:00,29133,I would lean more towards a low profile bait caster then that one. I have used both and I find that model uncomfortable. IMO
93617,Fang,2007-07-13 12:14:00,1330,"Silvio  Definitely double check the second offer. Usually this is a scam, Ebay rules normally force the seller to repost if an item transaction does not go through. Be wary if the seller is now asking for payment outside of ebay or pay pal.  I have 2 of these in left hand and they cast like a dream. Use them for spinnerbaits, buzz baits, jerk baits and stuff like that. They stink for pitchin or flippin just so you know.  I have 1 rigged with 50 lb braid for scum frogs and it held up a bit better than the Abu4600 and Zebco Quantum I used to use for this."
