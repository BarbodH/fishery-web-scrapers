I finally picked up two horse for my canoe so it's been a great season thus far!  Maybe this year, if we get together, you can show me how the master catches a champion musky.  Have a good one.  Best,  Sawyer"

Luckily for me another manager has had the brunt of this outbreak -- I've just had to pick up a little extra work to make up for it ...got out of work a 7:45PM yesterday .... 13 hour day in long enough though.  Again - thanks and best to both of you."
