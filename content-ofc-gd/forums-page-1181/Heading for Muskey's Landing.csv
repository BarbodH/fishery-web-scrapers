We are going up this weekend rent a boat at Muskeys Landing and spend the day with my in-laws. This may be selfish, but I am hoping for 2 of everything! The last time we went I caught the only fish and my lure was bigger than the fish!  So please what is the outlook and possibilities for Sunday? And yes I promise I will take my camera!  Lorissa"

Fished alot of cover such as lily pads, weed flats, arrowheads and they all produced fish.  Along with the bass and pike, I had also seen a musky that had to be pushing 50lbs just cruising some shallow weed flats in Gloucester Pool.  Very nice area to fish.  Good Luck!!!"

Tell you how much I love fishing and living in Ontario, my hubby as a wedding gift bought me 10 lures of all kinds.  Cya Lorissa"
