93879,lazybum,2007-07-14 02:55:00,142,"Would a charger like the one advertised work for a deep cycle battery?  I'm considering buying a small trolling motor for my canoe, a deep cycle battery and a charger."
93891,Dutch,2007-07-14 04:47:00,831,"I have (errr...had) one like the $44.99 special.  Past tense as it didn't last a full season.  I think those are made for lawn mowers and tractors on cold mornings, not for repeated abuse topping up deep cycles and cranking batteries."
