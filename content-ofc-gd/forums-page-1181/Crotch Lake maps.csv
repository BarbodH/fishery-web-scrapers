93890,Cadensdad,2007-07-14 04:31:00,1,Hello New here to the boards. I am going to Crotch Lake Ontario at the end of the month. Was wondering if anyone could point me in the right direction to purchase a descent map of the lake. Thanks in advance.
93908,Zamboni,2007-07-14 09:57:00,235,I don't think there is a good chart with depth marked-all I've sen is a fishing map with general outline of shoreline/islands and suposedly    where the fish are. PM me an email addy if you want that sent over-its not much help for navigation.
