This is what I have in my tackle box.  Senkos, Tubes, rapala top water minnow, spinner bait, inline-spinner baits, shads, top water frog, popper, crank bait...  im guessing these would work well...I just want to hear from experience of those who actually caught bass there."
93576,mikeymikey,2007-07-13 06:30:00,376,there you go...  start casting spinner baits and senkos. and try frogs where it is suitable.
93578,motv8tr,2007-07-13 06:59:00,2587,"Tubes have always been my go to for Bass, but have caught Pike with them as well...who knew?  As for holding Pike, just don't grab'em like ya would a Bass  Maureen"
93628,ranger520vx,2007-07-13 12:52:00,164,"Look for trees and fish/skip senkos.  Tubes have their place too. Pike-get a grip from top of fish behind cheeks/gill plate.   If your from shore, cover some water and you'll find them."
93926,dsn,2007-07-14 12:49:00,1018,I might be there next week also
93940,urbanangler1990,2007-07-14 16:01:00,933,me too
93953,Anatz,2007-07-14 18:23:00,74,"Yeah,I'm going to be there on Monday with my friend, we're both 19 and my friend never fished before.. if anyone is planning to go on Monday, private message me and maybe we could probably meet up somewhere on the island. Most likely I'll get there around like 12..and fish before rush hour. Oh yeah, my friend doesn't have a license..I heard you could buy a one day license at the boat house or something.. can someone confirm this? Anyways I hope the weather is nice and sunny =]"
