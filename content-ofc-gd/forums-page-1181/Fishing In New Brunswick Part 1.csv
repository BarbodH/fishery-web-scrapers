Only used to gettin' small ones but this year doin' a lot better.   I did get a chain pickeral when tryin' for brookies in Mud Lake. Thought it was a nice brookie then saw it was a small pickeral. I tried postin' some pics but they were too large. I got a digital and saved them at the smallest resolution but still only able to post one pic so I haven't yet. Might have to post 'em all after I get back next week. Saw a lot of lakes but most are private. It finally stopped raining today around 5 so I headed out. Got four more decent ones and threw back 3 small ones. Tried the creek down below my brothers around 830pm and got a 10 1/2 incher. Nice.  Boy it's hard to leave the creek, even when it's pretty dark. I loves fishin'. Pretty good trip this year but too darn short. Here's one nice 13 incher from Monday. "
