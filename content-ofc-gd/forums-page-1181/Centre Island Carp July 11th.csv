93302,dsn,2007-07-12 13:05:00,1018,July 11th. I haven fished the island for sometime now and was desparate to get into some bigger fish. Cause this summer so far I have been playing with smaller fish cause the location is closer to me since I moved. And checking the weather report they said there is a slight chance of strong thunder storms later in the morning. Well I decided to test my faith in almighty once more. Plus I haven't fished the locations at the island for some time now. So I'm not even sure if the carp are where they are supposed to be at this time of year. So I decided to give it a try. Urbanangler was supposed to meet me there but couldn't make it the last minute. It was really windy in the morning. And if a storm did blow through it would have been a real nasty one cause of the winds. I walked along the shore looking for anything that moved.  Saw some bass still busy doing their thing. Nice to see!! Then I saw some carp crusing around. I tossed in a micro plastic jig. As it fell and landed on top of a milfoil the fish headed towards it. And my blood started pumping. I knew that a micro jig wont be able to hold a carp but I wantted to have some fun and knew that whenever I wantted to release him I just had to horse him in and the hook would starighten out easily. He slowly moving in and looks down.. gulps the plastic and....  He makes a run!! Around and and up and down the bank wrapping as much weeds as he can to put pressure on the hook. Sure enough with all the weeds around my line between me and him. The jig straightens out. Just as I though it would happen.  Time to move on... to the famous carp pond. Saw some fish in there too. Boy was it easy pickens there. Take a look. They were in about 1 foot of water right up close to shore. Mind the land mines. Alot of it too I might add. (duck droppings)  I drop some corn in there. Right infront of thier noses. They spooked abit but couldn't resist the smell of sweetness. And came in. Just as it got closer to my hair rig I was getting ready to set the hook. It moves in picks up the hair rig. I see it disapear and go for the hook set!! Out comes the hair rig in mid air and there goes the fish.  Talk about getting all excited. I guess I was just too pumped. Ok over to my next location. The winds started to pick up at this point and everything gets darker and the clouds move in thick!! The clouds to my left were getting darker but on my right side it was still sunny.  I tossed my hair in and waited and watched the clouds come across my path. No rain yet. I knew if it started to come down I'd have to pull out my rain suit in a hurry. It got really dark. You can see in the next pic. And yes the fish were turned on!! The darker it got and with no rain made for a interesting day. Surely with conditions like this I knew smething big will surface from the deep. They always do come up when its dark. So beware!! A slight tug and slack on the line. Hmm must be a gobie. Then and other tug and out goes the line like frieght train snagged it !! Short fight and this guy shows up from the deep.  I said to myself ok they are here. But not much. I landed it and took a quick pic with what little light there was. The clouds were moving pretty fast by now. And I didn't see any dark clouds in the sky heading my way and no rain coming down. Infact it started to get brighter and only few rain drops. Not enough to run for cover.Then it finally happened the monster showed up. The line took off again like I snagged a missle. It took a very long run to seek out every weed patch there was in sight. But I had 14lb fireline which cuts through weeds very nicely. Which it didn't this time. So I had to take my time. And sure enough I landed the monster. During this battle I didn't even know that the clouds had moved off and the sun was coming out again.        I'd say he was the biggest I landed this year. It might even topped the biggest I landed last year also. It had a huge gut on it. Hopefully I'll be heading out again with urbanangler this time. I need a camera man.        dsn

93309,007,2007-07-12 13:25:00,537,"Nice one dsn.  How big was it (weight, length etc)? Sure looks like a 20-25pounder.  Hope to get out there with you one day - I could do the whole cameraman thing in between catching a few of my own!  007"
93314,mepps,2007-07-12 13:44:00,1301,nicely done!  Good to see some reports from the islands again!
93315,danw,2007-07-12 13:47:00,72,"Nice pictures, it is cool how you can see in the water with some of them."
93325,Victor,2007-07-12 14:27:00,1609,great job dsn! that fish looks like a high 20?  it's amazing enough how you did ur action shots while fighting your fish ... how the heck did u take a shot when u were setting the hook?? we gotta get together sometime so u can teach me that lol!!
93342,ADC,2007-07-12 14:56:00,82,I really enjoyed that review. It was like a little story with pictures!  You cant go wrong with Centre Island.  
93344,English,2007-07-12 14:57:00,90,"Great stuff DSN quality work, so you use the hair rig then, I know it is not a secret any more like for about 20 years but I just wondered do you think you get more takes using it as your fish see so little pressure I wondered is all. Any one use boilies as bait. Just wondering how you guys do it we all have different styles.  regards Clive"
93351,dsn,2007-07-12 15:08:00,1018, The Hair rig method I used to use all year round last year. But this year in the earlier season didn't work as well. Cause the fish weren't that aggressive on the takes. Plus when you have alot of smaller fish around (smaller carp 2-3lb range) and gobies around the hair can be a useless. So I started off using the old placing kernels on a hook method which worked great. I tried using bollies that day but nothing. So I switched back to corn. The corn was brighter under the cloudy sky and was very visible in the dark waters. I got more hits on that than with bollies for that day.    dsn

93361,dsn,2007-07-12 15:34:00,1018, Ahhh no thanks!! I might take them and think they were jaw breakers and start eating them myself.  dsn
93369,1leggedangler,2007-07-12 15:48:00,364,"Awesome pics! That one of the bass looks like it was taken from an aqaurium. Thanks.  Cheers, 1leg"

93381,wolfville,2007-07-12 16:10:00,396,"Novel like report, two thumbs up !"
93402,tbayboy,2007-07-12 17:29:00,1497,"Great report DSN, I'm not sure a camera man would have done any better."
93413,dsn,2007-07-12 18:07:00,1018," you can tell by how the pics I took, how they change from bright then got dark and then brighter again. Because of the clouds."
93428,English,2007-07-12 18:57:00,90,"You guys ever try peanuts popped up off the bottom say between 2"" and 6"" the popup is a piece of cork shaped to look like a peanut. In France i used to catch virtually every night on this method I used to always have 1 rod ( we could use up to 4 rods in France) with this setup and nearly every morning 5AM I would have a run it was spooky how regular they were. Nothing touches peanuts except carp, try soaking them in different flavoured dips I used to use quite large peanuts, 3 or 4 plus the cork, I used to think they will never take that but they did, we could buy a 10kg bag fresh from a birdfood wholesaler for a few quid and they would last for ever. They are virtually indestructible and you can cast them way out without worrying if they have flown off.  I presume gobies are crayfish of sorts??  Just wondering.  Regards Clive"
93445,MJL,2007-07-12 19:48:00,2427," Gobies are small invasive fish about 1-5 inches in length.  They have no problems stripping corn, bread and worms off your hooks.  Here's a link http://www.great-lakes.net/envt/flora-faun...asive/goby.html"
93461,English,2007-07-12 21:34:00,90,Cheers MJL getting the hang of things slowly  they seem like nasty little beggars. We have the American Signal Crayfish which has all but wiped out our native crayfish apart from up Scotland way last I heard anyway they are here to stay so we just got to get used to them shame though.  Thanks for taking the time
