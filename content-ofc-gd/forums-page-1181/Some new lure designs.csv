93504,mepps,2007-07-13 00:25:00,1301,"For Christmas I got a powder coat set from luremaking.com and I've been experimenting with painting whenever I have free time (which isnt very often!) My first 4-5 lures didnt turn out too well, but recently I have been able to get a nice even, smo0th coat of paint applied.  I'd love to hear some opinions and suggests for designs or techniques.  I mainly use #8 french blades.  here goes...     This is my favorite - named Blood Tiger   Here is one assembled...   And now my biggest lure so far - 19 inches of furry fury!  I put a #5 Mepps beside it to show the size difference!  "
93506,lunkerbasshunter,2007-07-13 00:29:00,2585,i love them all but i think the red and white and the black and yellow the best.  Good work!  Cheers!
93553,mikeymikey,2007-07-13 03:04:00,376,Wow... that is one huge lures. Do you actually plan on using that or is it for showcasing only?  I think you should sell some here for those who are interested.  Just so you can get some extra money to experiment with new luremaking.  By the way... I am still waiting for more video from your Vermillion trip. (high quality please)
93555,silvio,2007-07-13 03:09:00,433,I wonder how many birds died to make that lure lol. You should just put a duck on your line while your at it. Joking aside very nice lures keep at it.
93567,Dutch,2007-07-13 03:47:00,831,"19""?  I am jealous......lol."
93591,misfish,2007-07-13 10:25:00,29133,What is it??????????Are they not to be in the shape of a V  Nice job Mepps.
93616,Whopper,2007-07-13 12:13:00,2174,Well done Clive! Some nice looking blades!  Whopper
93619,mepps,2007-07-13 12:18:00,1301,"Thanks guys!  I have actually used the big one, its great for trolling.  I used it at LV - I had one hit, but didnt land the pike  The video is being worked on by Jon, and once my move is complete (moving to Nova Scotia, in a couple weeks) then I wil be working on editing aswell."
93624,Raf,2007-07-13 12:37:00,3495,the big-boo looks great.  I'd cast it.  The blades look good too.  Mine always end up looking clumpy.. how are you applying the powder paint?
93627,tonyb,2007-07-13 12:51:00,1637,"PINK!  Looks like you're having some fun wth making those baits.  You know what they say ""bigger bait for bigger fish""  Keep us updated on the 19"" bait, Love to see it hanging outta the yap of a large toothy critter."
93630,pigeonfisher,2007-07-13 12:56:00,696,"Now you are moving to Nova Scotia?  Mepps, The Rolling Stone!  Rolling stones collect no moss!"
93687,mikeymikey,2007-07-13 16:45:00,376,Moving all the way to Nova Scotia? Do you plan to live in every Canadian cities? or is fishing in Ontario too crowded for you ?  Well enjoy and hope to see that exciting video soon!
93791,Handlebarz,2007-07-13 21:52:00,3790,  Dang and we did not get out for some LSC musky action I guess you will be back in ON some day and we can hook up then I hope you live near a better bodie of water then the Thames
93818,mepps,2007-07-13 23:39:00,1301,"Raf:  I have teh spray kit from Luremaking.com, and I have a Coleman air compressor rigged to it.  I heat the blades in the oven at 400 for about 5 minutes, hang them, and spray! Then back in teh oven for at least another 5 minutes at a lower temperature, this melts the excess powder and gives it a smoth finish!  For deisgns, I use teflon tape wrapped around the blade, heat and spray the next layer - sometimes adding a third layer.  They dont look as perfect as I would like, but the fish dont seem to mind.  PF, MM: My girl is from Nova Scotia, and we want the baby born out near the ocean, plus her family lives there! I have gone from Ontario to Mexico, to Ontario, to the BVI, to Ontario - NS was the next logical steap   MrEh: I'm sure I'll be back in Ontario for soem fishing next year!  I havent been able to do any musky fishing yet, but I will be headign to Jack lake in a couple weeks, so im sure a few musky will surface."
