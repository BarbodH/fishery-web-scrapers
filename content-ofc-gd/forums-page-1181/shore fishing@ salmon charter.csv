92258,medmart,2007-07-10 01:03:00,587,can any one tell me where i can go shore fishing around the whitby area or a good salmon charter in the whitby area so i could take my son out thks
92301,Zamboni,2007-07-10 02:53:00,235,"You can fish Lake O tribs in fall when the salmon run starts, ccmt has few threads on shore fishing recently. Best local shore fishing I'm aware of is Scugog-maybe hwy 7A (7?) causeway just out of Port Perry on way to Cesarea but its often looks crowded.  There's few charters for Salmon operating out of Port Darlington-if nobody has a recomendation here try Spoonpullers site. Little early on North side but some large kings being caught."

92344,misfish,2007-07-10 10:01:00,29133,Im thinking it best to stay away from the bog for now till they find out what the heck is going on with the killing spree of fish. Im been hearing that musky and bass are being washed up on shore as well and there are no ducks even staying on the water.  The tribes which you got lots of in your area are awesome. Just make sure you read the regs on the boundries bro. Im sure theres got to be spots on Rice I just dont know any. Get yerself a boat.LOL
92388,lew,2007-07-10 12:44:00,12767," Brian, now it's REALLY starting to sound serious !!!!!  Have you heard the stories of musky & bass dying 1st hand or is it just rumours, and is it being linked with the carp die-off at all ??"
92424,misfish,2007-07-10 13:47:00,29133,Heard from a friend whom heard from a sorce close to the action.Thats all I know Lew.
92428,lew,2007-07-10 13:52:00,12767,"Thanks Brian, let's keep our fingers crossed that this isn't going to get too out of control before they get a handle on it."
92433,ccmtcanada,2007-07-10 13:56:00,7971,memart...check your PM!
92438,Zamboni,2007-07-10 14:05:00,235,"My wife heard same about Scugog from co-worker that lives in Port Perry-I dismissed it as nothing on here and in news. Sorry about that recomendation Memart, maybe renting a boat at Rice would be best local fishing in Lake O isn't apealling-not sure if there's shore fishing spots on Rice.  Thats really bad news on the Bog, we used to fish there often and kids often swam at Goerski's or sand bar across from Cesarea launch. When will MNR tell us what's going on-with carp die-off in Sturgeon also and now other species affected in Scugog its troublesome."
92443,ricoboxing,2007-07-10 14:09:00,398,i see people fishing for carp and catfish by the whitby harbour and the lynde shores conservation area.
92448,ccmtcanada,2007-07-10 14:14:00,7971, Maybe you've seen bly and I there!! LOL
92471,Zamboni,2007-07-10 14:44:00,235,"Waterfront Trail map gives you a good idea on parking and access points Memart if you want try Lake O shoreline:  http://www.waterfronttrail.org/maps/wt-3_08.pdf  That's Wilmot Creek, Whitby-Oshawa are on other pages....I've seen guys fishing the pier at Oshawa harbour, especially in the fall."
92474,ccmtcanada,2007-07-10 14:46:00,7971, It can get quite busy there in the fall...everyone casting out huge spoons...but the payoff can be golden!!!
92481,ricoboxing,2007-07-10 14:55:00,398,"nah cant be u guys, i never see anyone catching anything!"
92484,medmart,2007-07-10 15:02:00,587,thanks for the info guys i will check in to those spots   thks again rob
93514,Beans,2007-07-13 00:44:00,3339,Hey Memart...Welcome to the board...your brudder will prob tell you to just ignore all my good advice...   but since you asked...  Bowmanville and Port Hope can get good for salmon soon...keep your eye on the board for when they start running...we hooked some as early as mid July (or was it August...) three years ago using roe bags on bottom from shore...
93583,misfish,2007-07-13 09:52:00,29133,"LOL Beans. Rob listen close to this man of wisdom,he hasnt lived this long for no reason.Heck he fished Frenchmens Bay before it was even named Frenchmens Bay."
93600,medmart,2007-07-13 10:48:00,587,ok beans i will be watching thanks for the info  rob
