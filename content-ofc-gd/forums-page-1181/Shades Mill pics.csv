My wife and I drove down the road to Shades Mill Conservation Area for a quick hour or two of fishing. It started off very slow with only one perch that got on while trolling (it was the size of my lure). We then found a spot that had literally hundreds of perch so I switched from going for bass to perch. We caught them one after another and in that same spot managed a few bass, sunfish and crappie.       Had a good time, wish I had found a nice pike or bass but I'm use to not finding them:)  On the way back in I was trolling and thought that I had a weed but this little Largie was on "

There are some good bass in there, smallies as well as largies. I've heard stories of bigger pike but have only landed hammer handles out of there."
