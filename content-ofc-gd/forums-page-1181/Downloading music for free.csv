93456,Terry,2007-07-12 21:10:00,14456,oh you mean the guy that did goofy newfie song  try  downloading limewire and run it to download music...
93457,Tacklebuster,2007-07-12 21:11:00,303,"dont really know about whats out there, but over the years I have used limewire and it generally will get you  what your looking for on the music side.  As for s/w, don't bother, all riddled with viruses."
93459,Raf,2007-07-12 21:14:00,3495,limewire is good for music be careful with other stuff as it may contain virii.  if you are familiar with bit-torrent network you can just about get anything.
93462,misfish,2007-07-12 21:35:00,29133,"Thanks guys. Ok Im having a problem.First of all I have McAfee as my virus protector.I HATE IT.Going to go back to Norton. Anyhoo,when I put in the artist I get a search but nothing comes up.I know It worked for me before when I had dial up.Do I need to get rid of a firewall?  Here we go again. Computer dummy 101. Remember way back when I tried to post pic,s.LOL"
93471,spanky,2007-07-12 22:08:00,195,"try typing in Britney Spears.... wait, no... you'll get other ""goodies"" for the results... just type in a mainstream band to make sure it's working... heck, search for Aerosmith, if you get results you know it's working properly, might just be what yuo're after doesn't exist on the internet lol"
93473,Terry,2007-07-12 22:13:00,14456,don't know why it's not working I tried Harry Hibbs and got about 15 songs
93474,misfish,2007-07-12 22:22:00,29133,"I got it working and got over 1000 harry hibbs,but now it,s back to the way it was, nothing happening,plus my pc has slowed down.Very frustrating. Going to remove and redownload. Why do I do this to myself."
93486,medmart,2007-07-12 23:04:00,587,hey bro the last two times the kids where here they used lime wire and both times i got a virus and i had to take it in to get fixed so good luck  rob
93493,misfish,2007-07-12 23:38:00,29133,Yep Im thinking the same thing.It sure has slowed.
93507,danbo,2007-07-13 00:30:00,2646,"Limewire rocks. Try doing a ""disk defragmenting"" first..then spybot removal..then re-install Limewire from downloads.com"
93521,Fishnfiend,2007-07-13 01:01:00,357,"Okay, here's a tip from an ex internet narc: Make sure that you set your uploads to '0'.  Basically, it is not illegal to take something that someone wants to give you for free, just don't get caught giving away something that you don't have the rights to. Limewire should work for ya.  See if you can get an older version.  Quite often they work better."
93522,Fishnfiend,2007-07-13 01:02:00,357,FTR - Private messages are better for this type of discussion.
93525,danbo,2007-07-13 01:05:00,2646,AVG is a good & free anti-virus too.
93529,danc,2007-07-13 01:14:00,4677," The real answer is... forget about McAfee, forget about Norton and forget about Limewire. For virus protection, use AVG free. For any type of download that you heart desires, discover what torrents are and how to use them. Mind you I don't do any of this. It's just what I've heard."
93532,Lostchild,2007-07-13 01:27:00,153,"Try ""Frostwire"", I was having problems with Limewire and switched, so far so good."
93535,danc,2007-07-13 01:35:00,4677,"I just did a torrent search for Harry Hibbs. I got ""Harry Hibbs 47 songs"" and ""Harry Hibbs 52 songs"", amongst a few hundred other results. From what I've heard, this torrent thing works quite well."
93582,misfish,2007-07-13 09:48:00,29133,"Thanks I be have the company GEEK show me this Torrent,and how to use it.LOL"
93623,superdad,2007-07-13 12:35:00,353,Bit Torrent and Mininova.org work well.  I wish I had High Speed - ADSL is ok but High Speed would be llike lightening.  David  aka Superdad
93631,tonyb,2007-07-13 12:59:00,1637,"It never hurts to remove spyware, tracking software (cookies), etc...  a good program for cleaning that stuff up is Ad-Aware SE.  You can download it for free from:  http://www.download.com/Ad-Aware-2007-Free...dl&tag=top5  Install, and then do a full system scan.  When it completes select all entries and remove them, and it will probably ask you to reboot.  Sometimes it can take 2 scans to clean up everything but your PC performance will likely improve after running the scan.  Tony"
