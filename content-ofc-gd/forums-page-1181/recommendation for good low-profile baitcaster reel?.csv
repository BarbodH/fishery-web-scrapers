93770,setomonkey,2007-07-13 20:39:00,872,"I've got two baitcasting setups right now, one that I tend to use for trolling or casting heavy lures (Abu C3 on a medium-heavy rod) and an older Shimano reel on a medium Compre rod.  I'd like to get another low-profile baitcaster this year, which I would use mostly for casting spinnerbaits, crankbaits, and spoons.  I've narrowed my comparison list down to:  Shimano Citica Quantum Accurist Abu Revo BPS Johnny Morris Signature series  Does anybody have experiences with these reels? Positive or negative comments? Any recommendations not on this list?  Thanks guys, Mike"
93777,muskymatt,2007-07-13 20:49:00,2608,"I have the Accurist, excellent reel. I also have a diawa advantage, also a very good reel , nothing bad to say about either."
93781,setomonkey,2007-07-13 20:59:00,872,"Thanks for the quick reply Matt, do you prefer one over the other?  Mike"
93782,thecraftyprince,2007-07-13 21:09:00,37,"Mike check out Lebarons and find out if they have any Abu Garcia Torno 3004HSI's left, at a clearance price of $150, reg $225+, they are the schnizzle ola. They also make a 3003, another good reel and a 3006 which I haven't used. Light, small and tough as nails, press the thumb bar and spin the spool and you'll be amazed at how long it keeps spinning. I toss jigs/lures down to 1/4oz with it."
93783,muskymatt,2007-07-13 21:18:00,2608,"The advantage feels better in my hands, both cast awesome but the accurist seems to have a minimal advantage in drag, for me. I can't really pick one over the other. I switch frequently between the 2 while fishing  with  equal preformance in the 2."
93784,misfish,2007-07-13 21:28:00,29133,"I have to agree with Matt on this one. Comfort and feeling right, is what it,s all about for me."
93802,danbo,2007-07-13 22:39:00,2646,Daiwa Advantage Super-tuned is a sweet basser!
93803,hydro,2007-07-13 22:48:00,24, In this order:  1)  Daiwa or 2)  Quantum 3)  Shimano  Don't get the bps jm series.  Hope this helps.
93806,kemper,2007-07-13 22:56:00,2232,"Ive had bad luck with anything labelled BPS series. I picked up a baitcaster myself today actually, an Okuma for 170, 10 bearings and was FAR smoother than the shimano for the same price. Well see how it goes, but I have heard good things about okuma reels.  Personally I stay away from diawa because I had an expensive reel of theirs die on me twice, but it was probably just crap luck."
93835,Raf,2007-07-14 00:37:00,3495,"Chances are, if you're spending 150 you will end up with a quality reel no matter the brand  If it were my money, I'd be looking for a used Shimano Curado 200 or 201 if you are a lefty and putting the rest, if any, towards lures.  The Curados had the reputation for being the best reels in their price bracket for a long time.  The new versions will be a few more dollars."
93843,Daplumma,2007-07-14 01:11:00,1961,I'm with Raf on this one.The Curado is a tough reel that will do anything you want it to.. Joe
93858,fishdawg,2007-07-14 01:37:00,912,Curado - no doubt  and I have actually herd good things about BPS's line of rods/reel  (maybe Justin will see this thread) I  have 3 of their rods & love 'em
