93679,joonmoon,2007-07-13 15:56:00,528,If you use a fridge cart you will have the extra protection of a strap going down the stairs. A heavy duty piece of plywood mounted to the top as a transom is a really good idea too. Good luck.

Also check with West Marine and see what they have..  I have some PICS as plans that I received from someone on a fishing forums site.  If you want the PICS, PM me with your e-mail address and I will e-mail to you the PICS that I have.  carp-starter"

I have a dolly like that, but it just barely holds my 20-30 hp Johnsons (approx 120 lbs). This is what it looks like. You would need a more robust dolly for your motor.  http://www.myfishingpictures.com/showphoto.php?photo=129169 http://www.myfishingpictures.com/showphoto.php?photo=129170  Here is one I made out of an old BBQ. It holds up to 100lbs. I've had my big motors on it, but it really doesn't like it much. I really like the size of this one. Plus it can be rolled right up to a barrel for testing.  http://www.myfishingpictures.com/showphoto.php?photo=129168"
