92989,Fishmaster,2007-07-11 17:56:00,920,"Fishmaster Charters did her first test Charter.   It wasn't long before we were catching fish, even though the boat wasn't fully equiped yet with a fishfinder, running my own equipment came naturally.            All fish came off 20 jets & size 0 Dipsys with worm harnesses ..jets back 150 on a church inline board and 0 dipsys back 150 on a 2 setting in 72 fow off Port Maitland Dunnville  The boat is rigged and ready to go yahoo ;D  Not bad for a trial night    http://www.mountaincable.net/~fishmaster"
