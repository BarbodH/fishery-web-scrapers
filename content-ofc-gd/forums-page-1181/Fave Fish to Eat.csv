93147,addict,2007-07-11 23:15:00,475,walleye cheeks.then pike or walleye fillets taste almost the same to me also like perch and crappie.im a cajun fish crisp fan just coat and fry nice and easy.also try 2 parts italian bread crumbs and 1 part flour works well.damn this post is making me drool.
93150,danbouck,2007-07-11 23:18:00,4380,Beer Battered Fish Crisp is amazing!
93169,fishdawg,2007-07-12 00:14:00,912,Ive tried many different fish dishes in my time and Ive come to the conclussion that different species taste better when prepared best to compliment their flesh qualities.  BBQ'd salmon mmmm....  fresh fried perch/eyes/pike  mmmmmm cajun catfish mmm.....  cold smoked whitefish  mmmm.....   its Alllllll GOOD  side note  I once ate a legal (season & size) muskie due to profuse bleeding - i fried some  of the fillets & BBQ'd some steaks   they both tasted quite good as well.... but I would never specifically target a muskie for the table

Caught, clean and cooked within a hour or two doesn't get any better. Second would be yellow perch kinda of like eating chicken wings, can you say beer food  Whopper"
93440,aplumma,2007-07-12 19:32:00,6896,Muskie steaked and grilled with butter and onions over an open flame. O wait I havent caught a muskie yet so I guess it is Catfish fried with hush puppies and sweet potato fries......   Art
93447,ozaibak1,2007-07-12 19:54:00,401,"Bass or perch (never caught pike or walleye). Cut the head off, cut their guts out. BBQ all the way baby w/ skin on, some butter some oil some seasoning u know! best is big perch or 1-1.5 pnd bass, too big and they dont taste as fresh or good i find. I havent tried fillets cuz this method is easier for me and I dont know anyone who can show me how to do it firsthand"

93702,LipDip,2007-07-13 17:37:00,39,"Au natural for me, some of these recipes sound like you're better off eating a bag of Doritos lol. I like the taste of fresh fish, not so much marinades, crackers, chips, batters, sauces etc. 24"" lake trout, block of Crisco, couple lemons, white flour and cold beer on a flat rock is my favorite. Catch 'em and eat 'em, no idea why someone would fill a freezer, old fish for me is anything that's been out of the water more than a couple hours. If I feel like eating fish, I'll go out and catch a couple. Always like a feed of fresh pike on muskie trips. The lard concept is a little iffy for some but it's the best I've used on boat trips, small, no ice and it fries up fish or potatoes fast and light."
93710,Raf,2007-07-13 18:12:00,3495,"Mmmmm Lard.  I'm not picky when it comes to eating fish.. all of the above, plus I love them out of the smoker (cisco, trout, eel, etc.)."
93718,Headhunter,2007-07-13 18:35:00,5703,"Absolutely, without a doubt... Lard is king! The doctor can go pound salt! HH"
92923,Bcee,2007-07-11 15:26:00,25,"Fellow Anglers and Fish Connoseurs (Kind of a sewers),  Tell me what is your favorite fish to eat and how do you prepare it?  I have always been a perch and walleye fan, but thats because they are predominate down here in Norther Ohio.  The last few trips to Nipissing I have been making pike bites.  I cut out the bones during the filet process, and having kids, I cut the fish up into lil nuggets.  I use Panko style breading and mix in some parmagiano reggiano cheese.  Its very light.  I then saute them until golden brown.  Kids love em and so do I."
92941,Jay T,2007-07-11 16:29:00,282,"Myself I like walleye, perch, trout, whities and the odd pike. First walleye only with fish crisp in oil plane and simple they just taste to good. Perch also with fish crisp but sometime I will make a batter and deep fry them with pancake mix(add only water one), garlic, pepper, onion powder and instead of water use beer mmmmmmmmm I am getting hungry just talking about these lol. Trout always do mine on the BBQ in foil with lemon, garlic, pepper, butter, oinions and some mesquite (maybe spelt wrong). Whities I do the same as the trout. Pike first 5 way fillet and then fish crisp (butter and garlic one) once again in oil. Oh and also for the perch I crush up ritz crackers and add pepper, garlic, and is also very nice also.  Yours sounds pretty good bcee I will have to try that one."

92953,Rizzo,2007-07-11 17:01:00,4754,highliner fishcakes.  No idea what kind of fish or even mammals end up ground up in there but they sure are yummy
92961,Wes Bender,2007-07-11 17:16:00,105,"I love walleye, perch, and Crappie. Usually done in a breadcrumb mix with corn meal, garlic powder, lemon pepper, and oregano. The corn meal makes the fish very crunchy. Fry in very hot oil. Sometimes I swap breadcrumbs for crush goldfish crackers. Very Nice!  A very close second is trout/salmon on the BBQ. Give this recipe a go I am sure you will agree it is top notch.  In a deep dish baking pan, combine 1/3 cup oil, 1/3 cup soy sauce, 1/3 cup brown sugar, 1/2 cup water. Mix well and then season you trout or salmon fillets with lemon pepper and garlic powder. Marinade skin side up in the fridge for about 2 hours then straight on to a hot grill. Very important to go from the fridge to the grill without warming the fillets to room temp. I usually go flesh side down for 2 mins to get some nice grill marks and seal in the juices. Then flip skin side down for another 2 or 3 minutes depending on the size of fish.  BAM! and you have yourself one tasty meal."
92973,bbog,2007-07-11 17:36:00,665,"Crappie, walleye, perch and pike in that order. Depending on mood, Fish Crisp original flavour or Cajun."
92999,Yellow14,2007-07-11 18:19:00,29,I find it odd that with all the bass fishing in Ontario that so far nobody has listed bass as a favourite fish to eat.

93119,Rich Clemens,2007-07-11 22:04:00,3131,"Up to this point, it has primarily been bass.  After Muskystudd introduced me to Walleye ... I'll have to add that to the menu on occasion.  The one way like like the bass fillets and grilled.   Take the fillets, add some lemon and a couple other spices, wrap in foil, then on the grill.    Mmmmmmmm"
93128,Hookset,2007-07-11 22:20:00,367,"My favorite by far is Crappies. Sweet meat, easy to clean, and for small fish you get a good slab of meat off  'em. Deep fried with Fish Crisp....drool.  I can't eat a Bass because the Bass God would smite me down, dull all my hooks, and seize the motor on my boat. I think his name is ""El Fat Boy the Piggy Fish God"" or something like that. I saw him in a dream once the night before Bass Opener. I was drinking at the time. He said something about drinking too but I was too worried about the ""eating bass"" deal to worry about that. Gotta have your priorities straight.   Hookset."
