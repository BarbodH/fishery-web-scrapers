We plan on renting from Algonquin Bound Outdoor Store, or the Portge Store or Algonquin Outfitters, we wanna catch some brookies, maybe SM bass, and Lake trout, i was just wondering if anyone can shed some light on to which direction we should head out, we plan on crossing 2 or 3 lakes and rivers. As for lures i am familiarly with what to use just am totally location lost, never been there before, any help greatly appreciated( this weekend coming up)"
