93666,fisher,2007-07-13 15:17:00,451,Does anyone know of a free launch anywhere near Lagoon City?  I know Crate's Marina charges $10 each way (in and then out).  I am planning to fish in nearby Lakes while stationed at a Cottage at Lagoon City for one week and the thought of having to pay $20 each time I want to go to another lake is killing me.  If there is no other alternative I guess I have no choice but I thought I would ask.  Thanks.

I don't remember their being an attendant or a fee but we went during the week and were the only boat on the lake that day.  I think I recall a free launch in Beaverton too, but I remember it being quite steep, but usable and free.  When I'm in that area I usually launch at Quinns on the Peff river, $10 flat fee just off 48.  The run from Lagoon City to Crates in Keswick is quite a haul by boat, especially if it is rough.  Or is there another Crates Marine in Lagoon City?  Charles"

93733,fisher,2007-07-13 19:20:00,451,"Thanks, but would rather not launch too far - guess I will have to pay to play.  I know, I want my cake and I want to eat it too .  Thanks again."

I have a seasons pass for Lagoon City only because the in laws have a cottage nearby and the 'free' launch won't do anymore . tb"
