487733,Jer,2010-07-23 14:25:00,1426,"After less than a month of being dogless, Sandra and I made the plunge on Saturday and picked up our new pup.  Mom was a Golden Retriever, Dad was a Chocolate Labrador. She's 10 weeks old and just the sweetest puppy I've ever seen. Training has been going well, she's more than eager to please.  It won't be long til she's a faithful fishing partner.  Here are a few pics:               ...here we go again..."
487742,doubleheader,2010-07-23 14:48:00,497,She's a nice looking pup and she looks quite at home. Wish you all the best with her. My lab pup is now almost 2 years old and we love him to death.
487744,alexcba,2010-07-23 14:51:00,634,she's adorable. im sure she'll be netting fish for you in no time jer

487967,Gerritt,2010-07-24 02:46:00,6129,"awwww man... now you are making me want to get another!!!.... please post about about all the chewed shoes, poop and pee in the house, running crazy threw the house for no reason to remind me why I dont want another pup! Please for the love of god do it!!!!...   G"
487973,Dutch,2010-07-24 03:05:00,831,Good lookin dog right there.  Congrats!
488010,Jer,2010-07-24 12:22:00,1426,"  Sorry Gerritt, so far Moosy only chews her toys, has already learned that pooping and peeing is an outside activity (with only a couple ""accidents""), is fairly mellow in the house and is an all round great pup. She's laying at my feet chewing her monkey as I type. She even sleeps happily in her crate until at least 7 or 8 am. We've both been off work this week so that has helped. We'll see when we go back to work and she has to spend more time alone in the crate.  The cats are a little put out, but they'll get over it.  I'm loving having the pup. Our last dog, Bear, came to us at 9 months of age, well beyond his ""cute puppy"" phase, so this is all new to us."
488036,aplumma,2010-07-24 15:21:00,6896,ahh the look and smell of a puppy one of the best ways to get a human to adopt you. Good deal keep him health and happy and you will have the best friend of your life again.   Art
488164,Jer,2010-07-25 12:15:00,1426,"She's just too darn cute...it should be illegal.   Teasing our two cats has become great fun:       A relaxing kayak ride:     Swimming has been coming along:    ""OK, I'm done, let me out"":     She came out fishing with me last night for a bit as well. Perfectly happy to just curl up and got to sleep."
488174,Bill Shearer,2010-07-25 13:00:00,456,"There are no ugly puppies, but Black Labs are the cutest of the lot!  Life long friends."
488176,Roy,2010-07-25 13:09:00,13728,"Great looking buddy you have there, Jer. Many years of memories and good times."
488179,ChrisK,2010-07-25 13:28:00,2772,"Yup,she's a cute one. Looks like she's fitting in just fine. Won't be long before the cats are cuddling up with her for afternoon naps."
488196,Toddyc20,2010-07-25 14:35:00,141,Great looking dog you have there.  Let the fun begin.
