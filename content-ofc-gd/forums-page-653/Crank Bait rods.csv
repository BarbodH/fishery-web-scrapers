487310,bassjnkie,2010-07-21 23:44:00,1101,"I looking for 2 crank bait rods. A Spinning rod for small crank baits on light line. Also a baitcasting rod for medium, large and lipless crank bait. Any help would be great. Thanks"
487333,Alumacraft,2010-07-22 00:39:00,139,Dan I picked up a Shimano Compre TC4 series crank bait rod specifically for lipless cranks and I love it. The TC4 are the crankbait series made of a blend of graphite/glass.I picked up the 7' 8-17lb 1/4-3/4 oz medium power medium/fast action baitcaster. For around $125 bucks you get a great rod and your not breaking the bank.Check them out you won't be disappointed. Hope this helped Rob
487349,Fang,2010-07-22 01:13:00,1330,"on the less expensive side I bought a BPS cranking stick 7' telescopic baitcasting rod when they were clearing them out a while back. Think I paid $40US + shipping. I figured it was for a one time application. I still use that as my crankbait rod. Has great balance and fast action for 8-17 lb test. Have boated a lot of bass and walleye on it and it stood up fine to big gators in northern manitoba.  I had picked up various 6'6"" and didn't care for the feel of the shorter rods. With the 7' I was very pleasantly surprised!"
487372,ra95,2010-07-22 02:22:00,49,"If money is a concern, go Avid (Which I have 1 for sale If money is not a concern, cant go wrong with GLX or Steeze.  But no matter what, Compre $125 is way too expensive. Adding ten dollars could be Avid or at least Crucial level.  Anyway, never buy a rod that refuses to claim a life-time warranty."
487376,uglyfish,2010-07-22 02:39:00,981,"check out the quantum Tour KVD cranking rods. there are 6 different models i believe. awesome rods, great action, designed by KVD. they have a life time warrenty and quantum is the easiest and best place i have ever dealt with for warrenty issues."
487399,Ben_Daniels,2010-07-22 06:10:00,435,"I recently picked up a Shimano crankin rod for pretty cheap, it's a 7'0 ML-Fast Bob Izumi series. Its around $70 new but I found one for $25 still in the wrap so I had to get it!Gonna spool up my new Citica with some 10 lb mono and try it out on Sunday, I'll tell ya how it goes!  -Ben"
487426,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-07-22 11:26:00,0,I second the Shimano Compre series TC4. I have a medium heavy action rod with a medium fast tip and it is a really good crankbait rod.  How much you looking to spend?
487453,MCTFisher9120,2010-07-22 13:33:00,3761,"I'll be trying a St Croix Avid out next year I know, seem to be build well. Although not a crankbait rod my Avid spinning rod(ML) has done me very well."
487472,bassjnkie,2010-07-22 14:45:00,1101,"Cool, I'm going to definitely check out the Avid. Quantum KVD looks promising. I'm not into Shimano, but I have to take a look at the TC4 rod. Nice I have some shopping to do!!"
487489,bucktail,2010-07-22 16:28:00,1857,"I have a 7' Loomis Crankbait rod that I love , expensive but it is my favorite rod of all. Alot of the times when I am missing fish on hooksets Ill pull it out to slow myself down a hair and my hooking percentage goes way up."
487628,fishinguypat,2010-07-23 02:06:00,547,in general you need a rod with a soft tip but has enough backbone to fight the fish in...
488081,bassjnkie,2010-07-24 20:46:00,1101,Thank you for the great suggestions. I'm sure the Avid will work great for me. Thanks again.
