Can't fish alone because of chronic disability (MS), so have to wait for my helpful buddy to have free time. Finally was able to go yesterday and tried new lake to us. It was okay and we caught some fish, it was nice to get out of city, relax and throw spinnerbaits and topwaters. Caught some smallies this way all between 1-2 lbs.  Most were about this size.   First fish of the day was this walleye caught on similar spinnerbait in 2 ft. of water. A real unexpected catch.   Nice to get out fishing and try new lake, didn't even wreck prop on this hyped lake."

488326,Leecher,2010-07-26 00:10:00,7832,Cool surprise to catch an eye on a spinnerbait Sounds like you had a great time out on the new lake Yes it's nice to get out of the city.... got out for a few hours late afternoon yesterday also and got a couple of pan size specks.... went 2 for 25.... had steady action from the very start  Thanks for sharing Eric!!! Leechman
488338,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-07-26 00:38:00,0,Well? Did you slay them?lol That pickerel looks like it is exactly where I said they would be. Pickerel on spinnerbaits is quite common for the Kawartha's.
488342,Pigeontroller,2010-07-26 00:54:00,2793,Good to see you got out finally Eric!
488366,ehg,2010-07-26 01:53:00,2666,"Thanks Jacques, we were expecting better results but just happy to be fishing.  Ya, have caught walleye before on spinnerbaits but this one was under dock right by the shoreline. I think you know this lake, lol. Fishing shut down after lunch hour and picked up a little later. Certainly didn't slay them but first time there. Weird little lake! In afternoon tried microtube/float setup for panfish and caught none. Is their panfish here?   That is one of spinnerbaits i got from you, and rod/reel combo. Cheers, Dax  Thanks for replies!"
488386,fishinguypat,2010-07-26 02:25:00,547,last time i went fishing i caught two eyes trolling a spinnerbait and i was shocked... nice walter!

488403,OhioFisherman,2010-07-26 04:30:00,6623,"Glad to see you got out Eric! MS sucks! Walleye? my biggest one came on a spinner bait, Georgian Bay. Nice fish."
488405,Sinker,2010-07-26 05:44:00,8692,"Nice to see you out Eric. If you ever want to get out around here, get in touch. I'd be happy to get you on the water.   S."
488425,WeedLine,2010-07-26 11:41:00,322,Something is better than nothing. Try going back in the fall or spring.
488427,Bly,2010-07-26 11:45:00,1556,"Good to see you getting out, always enjoy seeing the multi species you manage."
488452,bucktail,2010-07-26 13:20:00,1857,One of my favourite techniques on Quinte in the summer is slow rolling a spinnerbait thru 6-12 feet of water for eyes. They still seem to school in the weeds but the constant pick of largemouths keeps you busy.
488472,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-07-26 14:02:00,0," You know what? I wondered the same thing for a while. The only place I have seen baitfish(a perch), is next to the river in the north east corner or in the river itself. Strange hey?"
488587,ehg,2010-07-26 18:23:00,2666,"The lake looks good, i was thinking of going back in the fall. Had a CO stop by us to check licenses etc...he said muskies really are on in fall and are pretty big. CO pulled 3 other boats off of lake for whatever reason.  Used your tips on area, thanks will do even better next time."
488628,solopaddler,2010-07-26 20:02:00,8605,"Glad to see you got out, and wow is that ever a dark walleye!  Not all that surprising though.  "
