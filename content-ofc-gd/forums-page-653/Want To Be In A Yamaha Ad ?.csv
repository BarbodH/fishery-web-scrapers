488470,craigdritchie,2010-07-26 13:57:00,1586,Received this press release from Yamaha in this morning's email:             So ... who wants to be a star?
488507,blaque,2010-07-26 15:31:00,2419,I think thats a good approach. I dont listen to a thing i hear or see in advertising these days anyway.......of course its going to be the best of whatever it is being advertised when the company selling it has all the say lol.  Using real testimonials makes much more sense these days. If they keep them real that is. For sake of authenticity they should throw a few people who have constructive criticism and maybe an issue or two into the advertising frey.
488511,Roy,2010-07-26 15:40:00,13728,"A decent marketing plan for them but in order for me to be a ""star"", I'd need to paint my 4 stroke Mercury which I'm very happy with. But then... my Merc. is probably a Yamaha in Merc. clothing. Thanks for the heads up, Craig."
488530,lew,2010-07-26 16:14:00,12766,I don't want to be in a commercial but I DO luv my Yamaha  
488539,smally21,2010-07-26 16:28:00,993,i replied but they wont let me show my johnson on tv.
488540,Headhunter,2010-07-26 16:28:00,5703,"Well jeez Lew, I don't think I can think of a more appropriate endorser of Yammy products! If Yammy motors can put a smile on your face, well that in itself would be an accomplishment that many a musky, has been unable to achieve! HH"
488571,SlowPoke,2010-07-26 17:35:00,2984,"Looks like Dave priced himself out of the running for the 2011 campaign I like the average Joe approach but I'm even skeptical about most of those. The best advertising is to be the best and have everybody talking about you. If you can't be the best, sponser a Formula 1 car!"
488592,lew,2010-07-26 18:36:00,12766," Not many things can put a smile on this ole kisser HH, but the purrrrrrrrrrrrr of a Yammy is one thing that can fer sure !!!!"
488603,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-07-26 19:13:00,0,The number one thing I look for when I buy a boat is a Yamaha! It would have to be a really sweet deal for me to buy a merc.
488609,Headhunter,2010-07-26 19:26:00,5703,Lew... HH
