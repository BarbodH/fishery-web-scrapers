We boated a nice 5 lb about 7:30AM then nothing for 2 hours.  Caught a small 3 lb around 12 noon.  A friend in another boat decided the fishing was slow so he left.  We trolled into another area   WOW - 4 nice wallys in less than an hour.  Over all for the day 8 wallys, 1 9lb, 4@ 5 - 6lb, 2@ 3lb.  Beauty day!!  Oh yah 1 smallie @2.5 lb. 2 weeks ago we caught 5 wallys - boated my biggest at 29"", 9.5lb.  I would like to post some pix but lack the knowledge how to do this.  If someone could email me with step by step instructions I'd appreciate your help.  Thanx [emailÂ protected]"
