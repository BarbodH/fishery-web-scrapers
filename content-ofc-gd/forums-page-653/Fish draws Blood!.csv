Now Im wondering, Im thinking this is a Pike but could it be a Muskie? I never caught a muskie and this just seemed alittle different, maybe Im tripping but yawl experinced Muskie Masters can tell me what sliced my thumb open........OUCH!   "

488135,alexcba,2010-07-25 03:03:00,634,that would be a northern pike

488137,alphaalpha,2010-07-25 03:14:00,475,you didn't try to lip him did ya?
488143,SRT8 smoker craft,2010-07-25 03:45:00,1107,Is that a livewell on your yak ? if so thats cool!
488144,Guest LivingLegend,2010-07-25 03:45:00,0,"  I sure did my friend, wanted to get a shot with its mouth open. I know better then to be stickin my fingers in a Pikes mouth but thought i was quicker..........i thought wrong . I just bought some Berkley gloves too but of course i forgot them"
488146,Guest LivingLegend,2010-07-25 03:50:00,0,"  That it is SRT8, it has a pumpinside and intake on the underside of the yak. i flip a switch and it pumps it in to the livewell. It also has a sliding console with rod holders and fish finder. I run a 30lb thrust trolling motor that I had custom made (Bassyaks) and assembled it just a few weeks ago, havebt used my paddle much since........ Bring it on fish......."

488384,fishinguypat,2010-07-26 02:23:00,547,you should have checked  underneath the fish's head to see how many pores it had
488393,Guest LivingLegend,2010-07-26 03:26:00,0,"  Exactly! I just found that out, Pike have 8 and muskie have like 10 to 12 pores. Most say its a Pike, my buddy thought it was a muskie for sure, guess I'll call it a Musike......."
488484,Roy,2010-07-26 14:18:00,13728,"So you ask everyone whether it's a pike or a muskie. The folks tell you it's a pike (and it is) but you ignore the answers and call it a muskie all the same? If you had your opinion formed beforehand, why even ask?"
488543,Guest LivingLegend,2010-07-26 16:32:00,0,"  Good point, will do next round."
488573,bigbuck,2010-07-26 17:45:00,2449,"Split the difference, call it a musky/pike cross, a tiger musky!!"
488679,muskymatt,2010-07-26 23:06:00,2608, He didn't call it a muskie Roy....he called it a Musike.... a little play on words....you might want to wear your glasses when reading..
