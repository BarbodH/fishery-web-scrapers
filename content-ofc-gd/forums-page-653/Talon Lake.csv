We were only in a small aluminum, I have a larger boat this year and am hoping for a lot bigger musky. Was just wondering if anyone has any tips for this lake or first hand experience? I know it's a really deep lake 80 feet +.  Thanks"

The lakers will be deep right now but there around, I got most of my trout ice fishing or early spring trolling."

Your best bet for large musky is on the North side of the lake heading towards Camp Connawongo (Redbridge). The North shore has lots of jutting points, small islands and submerged islands ""humps"" that are good for musky.  The walleye fishing is pretty good as is pike fishing.  If you get bored with the musky trolling/casting try the deep basins in the middle where depths can reach 150'. A deep diving crank bait might even land you a nice laker."
