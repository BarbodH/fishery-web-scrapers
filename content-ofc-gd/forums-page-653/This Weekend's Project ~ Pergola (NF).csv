Someone local to me was selling a 10X10 pergola with a custom made canvas awning for $200   . I had no plans for anything strenuous this weekend, other than prepping for my trip to White River on Wednesday. I couldn't pass it up though.  The only glitch was it had to be dismantled. I called the person up, told them I'd take it and headed over with my tools. It took me 31/2 hours to get the darn thing apart, some of the lag bolts were impossible to remove. Of course it poured rain the entire time I was there and the backyard was an unfinished mud pit. I was covered head to toe with muck and sweat LOL! I got 'er done though.  Got it home then spent the balance of Sat and most of Sun building it. Had to replace the lattice on top but that wasn't a big deal. Gave the wood a quick sanding and a coat of stain and got it together.  My wife loves it (minus the awning...she hates the awning   ).  I like it though. The back of the house was kind of bare, we needed something there.  I've been working like a dog recently, this week it's time to fish again. Headed north of White River on Wednesday for trophy walleye, can't wait.      "

488442,Sandbag,2010-07-26 12:51:00,533,"Mike....I sure hope my wife never reads your posts.  With moving only a short time ago, finishing the shed and now moving the pergola in; you make me look like a lazy ass.  Enjoy your fishing trip to White River.  Cheers  Craig"
488476,HTHM,2010-07-26 14:07:00,4082,"I would suggest putting some ""K"" bracing at the top of the posts and fastening the base of the posts to the concrete. PM me your digits and I'll give you a call with a more detailed explanation."
488569,Tarzan's Jane,2010-07-26 17:13:00,1183,"Nice....I agree with your wife - the awning needs to go - it just takes away from it, kinda like trailer park deco.  Much rather see the wood."
488577,brw,2010-07-26 18:00:00,101,Solo: Nice pergola. we enjoy ours a lot. Where are you heading to out of White River? Am heading there next week to Esnagi and am wondering if you are headed there too. Regards.
488589,solopaddler,2010-07-26 18:26:00,8605, PM sent.    Women        I'll be portaging into a back lake (hopefully filled with huge walleyes) with my squareback and 2hp motor.  You should have a great time at Esnagi. Great lodge and good lake.  Cheers
