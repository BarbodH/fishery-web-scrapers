487613,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-07-23 01:44:00,0,Them Americans have some mighty good catfishin waters!!!
487858,craigdritchie,2010-07-23 19:48:00,1586,The Fox news reporter sounds like the biggest redneck on the planet. Where the heck did they get this guy?
487860,NAW,2010-07-23 19:57:00,4022,  He sounds hammered!
488177,dave524,2010-07-25 13:09:00,4508, you want rednecks and Asian Carp? check this out  http://channel.nationalgeographic.com/series/monster-fish#tab-Videos/08361_00
488229,craigdritchie,2010-07-25 16:35:00,1586,"Redneck or not, that looks like a riot!"
488231,TC1OZ,2010-07-25 16:47:00,987,"The bow hunting looks cooler, but the Giant Catfish is sweet. And the redneck fishing is pretty awesome as well!"
488238,MJL,2010-07-25 17:06:00,2427," I wonder if there are any tournament restrictions like mounting a set of electro-shockers on your boat and going to town with a few nets like these  http://www.leslies-luton.co.uk/store/product/2194208/CATFISH-PRO-CATFISH-LANDING-NET-60in/  I might not be a redneck, but I definitely have a few tactics to use out thereâ€¦Any benefactors willing to sponsor me with a boat and some $?  Properly working live wells not necessary  Rotenone suppliers are very welcome as sponsors"
488298,Dave Bailey,2010-07-25 21:51:00,1641,I'm thinking that the best use for asian carp is fertilizer.
488304,Fang,2010-07-25 22:22:00,1330,Reports are they are excellent table fare and I read somewhere they will start being farmed from the wild. I think there is a name contest to get away from the carp and you'll start seeing them in restaurants as silverfin. From latest infishermen I think
488311,Dave Bailey,2010-07-25 23:05:00,1641," Actually, that sucks. If there's money to be made then we'll never get rid of them and there will be lobby groups opposing any attempts to eradicate them."
