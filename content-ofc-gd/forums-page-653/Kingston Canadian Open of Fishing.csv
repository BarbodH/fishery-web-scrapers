488207,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-07-25 15:17:00,0,WOW! Bob Izumi from 65 to 5th! Must have caught one monster bass!
488209,splashhopper,2010-07-25 15:21:00,2931,  What is BFB ?
488220,Grimace,2010-07-25 15:58:00,2020,  It is nice to see Izumi still up there.  Izumi once had a stare down with Chuck Norris and emasculated him so badly that he turned from Major Scott McCoy into Walker Texas Ranger.
488232,craigdritchie,2010-07-25 16:52:00,1586,"Bob Izumi is not afraid to gamble, so sometimes he wins big ... and other times he's roadkill. I remember fishing the Kenora Bass International tournament with him about 10 years ago. We absolutely bombed the first day when the big, suspended smallmouth we were targeting never showed up. But they did show up on the second day, and we went from 134th place to 29th place in just a few hours - it still stands as a KBI record for a one-day improvement. We wound up finishing in 8th or 9th, I think, out of more than 200 boats, and within about three pounds of the winner. We would have won the thing easily if those dang smallmouth had cooperated on the first day.  The guy is an amazing angler, plain and simple. It was a real treat to watch him keep his cool and stick to his game plan, even when it wasn't looking very good at all. Talk about confidence.  Mark Kulik is very similar. He's another guy who is not afraid to gamble, so he's always a threat to win regardless of where he is in the standings."

488500,legacey,2010-07-26 14:58:00,127," I fished this event as a NB....I had an amazing pick with;  John White day 1 Dave Mercer day 2 Mark Kulik day 3  Mark was in 29th and I 19th in day 3. He said to me....""were both sitting on the bubble....did you want to run to a spot I know that has good fish, go for it and hope they bite or stay close and see what happens?""  First; I can't tell you how much that meant to me, to be asked and considered by someone I watch on TV and is one of my fishing idols. Knowing Mark is an amazing fisherman and trust his judgement, I said ""lets go for it!""  Although the fish didn't cooperate where we went, with the blow ups we had (big fish rolling on our baits but not committing), I could understand why we made the run. It had the potential! But that's fishing!!  He was very apologetic and felt bad that it didn't pan out. Now that's the showing of a true gentlemen but in my opinion and having been asked what I thought we should do, it was my decision too to have done so and have no regret.  At the end of the day, I could say I got to fish and become freinds with a fishing icon, hard-core amazing angler and even more importantly to me, as mentioned, a true and honest gentlemen that made me feel like we've known eachother for years.  I can't tell ya how much fun I had and was so impressed with his consideration of me.....so if you read this, thanks Mark!  By the way....man can he drive that Interstate rig of his. That in itself was amazing to see in real life and well worth the run!  Cheers,  Paul"
