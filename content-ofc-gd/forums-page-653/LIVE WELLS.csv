488430,BITEME,2010-07-26 12:13:00,1968,doing some deck rework on the beast  Does anyone know where to get live wells in the GTA not from fishing stores necessairly but tank manufactures will work as well needs to have a hinged lid with a gasket. I can do all the plumbing.  Peter
488432,Roy,2010-07-26 12:17:00,13728,My first question would be why do you need a livewell Peter?
488434,aniceguy,2010-07-26 12:24:00,1094,"the specific livewell for that boat came from a rotational molder in california, but there is a tank supplier in Mississauga just google rotatioal molders and you ll find it  ** saved you the trouble Peter**  I went back into an old hard drive and found it, I couldnt get the right size to fit but if your going smaller no probs finding one here http://www.plastictanks.ca/category.php?cat_id=029"
488448,BITEME,2010-07-26 13:16:00,1968,too big I want to down size it and have the extra space as a rod locker and storage

488451,Roy,2010-07-26 13:18:00,13728," But unless you're doing tournaments, why do you need a livewell?"
488460,I'mHooked,2010-07-26 13:38:00,525, A place to keep the ice & pop!...Maybe a cold steak sandwhich
488482,charlesn,2010-07-26 14:16:00,551, My kids love it when I put the fish they catch in there for a bit and let em go at the end of the day.  It's sorta like a portable aquarium for the day.  I've seen them used as a porta pottie too.  But that's just wrong.  lol
488483,BITEME,2010-07-26 14:18:00,1968, Lakair and Simcoe come to mind  You know what your right I dont need one I can make a portable live well and gain the space ....now why didnt I think of that thanks Roy
