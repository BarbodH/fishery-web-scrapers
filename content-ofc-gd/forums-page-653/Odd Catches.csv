488242,TC1OZ,2010-07-25 17:17:00,987,"In the 12 Mile Creek I caught a fold-able lawn chair. I have a feeling peoples epic fish stories are some large odd item but they don't use braid so they never get to see what it is! hahaha. At first I thought it was a snag, then when I got it out of the mud it put up an interesting fight in the current."

Next day caught a bunch of lakers ( a couple 30""+ ) and decided to go try to fish the downrigger out.  Ended up with two fishing rods from the bottom of the water, haha.  I've caught a turtle, a dog, myself, rescued a seagull once and my buddy caught a bat, unfortunately it drowned in the water after it hit the lure in mid air."

You ruined their plan.  Good on ya."
488296,BillsTheBassMan,2010-07-25 21:48:00,932,"This week I caught a 4' metal pipe and some mennonite ladies leggings - nasty.  I had a snapping turtle on my line a few months ago, but I managed to shake it.  I've also caught a car battery.  My buddy caught a snake, but the snake turned out not to be hooked, he just really wanted the minnow and FINALLY let go after he was suspended from a bridge and was shaken around a bit."

488124,hunterjoe84,2010-07-25 02:20:00,52,Just recently I caught a shovel in fast moving water at a lock.  It put up one heck of a fight!!!  had no idea what it was.  It was moving back and fourth in the current and stripping some line.  Finally was able to land it.  I have also caught a rock while perch fishing.  The rock had a small hole in it and the hook went right in it and pulled it to the surface.
