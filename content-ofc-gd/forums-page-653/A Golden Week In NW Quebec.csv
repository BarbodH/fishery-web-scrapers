487780,MJL,2010-07-23 15:40:00,2427,Fantastic report Mike   Does this mean they'll be getting a Riverkeeper or an AngSpec when they start hitting up the rivers?
487784,solopaddler,2010-07-23 15:44:00,8605, Absolutely. Did you even have to ask?   
487792,strakey,2010-07-23 16:15:00,78,Looks like you had a good time Mike.  Nice fish for such a hot week. As far as the shed goes buy her a fashionable set of polars and the shed won't look so orange anymore  regards  andy

487943,Leecher,2010-07-24 01:30:00,7832,"Just doesn't get any better than that Mike Looks like the water level is down up there.... looking at the rocks in front of your cottage     I'm sure in a normal season, that level is little higher at this time of year.  Ya sure got a beautiful place, a real gem and some good fishing!!!  Loved the last pic of the sun down over the fire  Thanks for taking the time to post and share with us!!! Leechman  PS Forgot to ask... any whities caught while catching them beauty eyes??"
487999,solopaddler,2010-07-24 11:03:00,8605," Thanks Jacques.  The only time I can catch whities on my lake is in the evenings, late June/early July when the mayfly hatch is on and they're rising.  I've marked massive schools on my electronics down deep in 60 plus feet of water and can't for the life of me catch them.  I've tried vertical jigging with a bunch of different lures (Bad Boyz, small Williams with a pearl trailer, Swedish Pimples, Jigging Raps) and havn't caught a damn thing.  Cracking that summer fishery is my personal white elephant."
488016,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-07-24 12:59:00,0,Awesome report and time well spent with the family. Nice slice of heaven you have. Thanks for sharing.
488234,ehg,2010-07-25 16:56:00,2666,Another great post by you  Reminds me of your post of the trip to the top of the mountain for blueberrries a couple of years ago. Thanks
487312,solopaddler,2010-07-21 23:44:00,8605,"With a busy spring and early summer behind us and finally settled into our new home, my little clan was long overdue for a trip north to the camp.  Normally I would have been up 4-5 times already but this was the first trip of the year. Definitely a sight for sore eyes.    In late May I rented a trailer and my dad drove a load of futon furniture up to the camp for me. It's been in our basement for a few years and we knew we weren't going to use it in the new house. Looks pretty good in the cabin I think.    Never before have I spent such a hot week up there, wow! Even at 10pm the thermometer in the cabin was consistently over 30 degrees.  Not so great for sleeping...but it made for fantastic swimming. My two little ones, 3 and 6 took swimming lessons all winter and spring. Twas money well spent, both of them took to the water like fish.  My boat dock is pretty deep and never before have they had the nerve to jump off into the unknown scary depths. By the end of our first evening they were both at it non stop (although my little guy was a bit more hesitant than his big sister   )             With the blistering hot weather we spent a lot of time at the beach. Had it all to ourselves for the whole week as well.        Most evenings the kids flaked out on the boat ride back to camp. Fresh air seems to knock 'em out.      Surprisingly (at least to me) the blueberries were already ripe. Pretty much every day Brendan helped his mom pick a cup on our point.    The kids spent a lot of time as usual fishing down on the pump dock. They never caught anything but I don't think they cared.      'Course we did try our hand at some more serious fishing. With the super hot weather the fish were deep and fishing was tough during the day. We had our moments though. My lake is primarily a walleye lake and when the bite is tough a simple live bait rig with an air injected nightcrawler is money in the bank. That's generally how I'll rig the kids rods especially when there's a favourable wind to help with the drift.  On one occasion we fished a small rockpile directly in front of the camp and hit over a dozen good fish, with both kids getting a few. While the frenzy was happening the wind whipped up and we endured a brief downpour.  My girl didn't mind getting wet though.    We had at least 3 doubles if memory serves.    We kept 3 for dinner and cleaned them on the rockpile. (You can see the camp in the background)      Fortunately my entire family loves fish. Of course I had to include the ""money shot"" LOL!      My girl had a hot hand for much of the week fishing wise. No huge fish were caught, but good numbers of these guys kept her smiling:      As mentioned it was blistering hot and more than once while trolling some deep offshore clay flats we jumped in to cool off. Freaked the kids out the first time but they soon got over it.       With the crazy heat there were very few bugs even at sunset.  We had more than one campfire while we were there, but our very last night was special.  I never get tired of the view.      It was a perfect way to recharge the batteries and spend time with the ones I love.  Can't wait to get back up there next month.  Cheers,  Mike"
487315,kickingfrog,2010-07-21 23:54:00,8333,So nice it had to be done twice.
487318,alexcba,2010-07-22 00:08:00,634,great report. awesome pics  looks like you had a truly relaxing and peaceful week.
487319,Fish Farmer,2010-07-22 00:08:00,2234,"Man, you got a nice place. Couldn't be better than with the family. I see you burning the Sat Dish. With a place like that who would want to watch TV Thanks for sharing"
487321,trevy727,2010-07-22 00:16:00,351,ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL. HOW LONG IS THE DRIVE?
487322,NAW,2010-07-22 00:18:00,4022,That's a beuty camp you got there Solo.  How many other camps on the lake?  Sure does look peaceful up there!
487323,bigugli,2010-07-22 00:20:00,6138,Nice little corner of paradise you have there. Great place to share time with the young ones.
487325,solopaddler,2010-07-22 00:24:00,8605," 7 hours door to door.    There's a good number of camps on the lake mainly because of it's proximity to Rouyn Noranda (it's popular with the locals). Most of them, mine included are water access so it's still pretty quiet. The fishing is decent on the main lake if you know the tricks. The back lakes near the camp are just spectacular though."
487326,Terry,2010-07-22 00:24:00,14456,nice spot you got there
487327,solopaddler,2010-07-22 00:26:00,8605, I know it's weird. I have no idea what happened there!  Mod's please remove the 2nd post!
487358,msp,2010-07-22 01:42:00,1336,A St.Croix Avid & Stradic for the young lady...... you aint messing around! Feel good thread of the year.
487359,Nipfisher,2010-07-22 01:42:00,2449,"Solo, I'm from Kirkland Lake which is only 40 minutes from Rouyn. All of the lakes East of Larder Lake are absolutely beautiful.  I'm guessing because it is Quebec live bait (minnows) are not allowed?"
487363,danbouck,2010-07-22 01:54:00,4380,Just awesome!
487365,Joey,2010-07-22 01:55:00,9122,"Mike, another steller report.  You have a beautiful cottage and a beautiful family.  You are one lucky man  Joey"
487366,solopaddler,2010-07-22 01:58:00,8605," You got that right. No kid of mine fishes with anything less.    I'm sure we fish a lot of the same lakes then. Many of the smaller back lakes I fish are actually in ON. Definitely no minnows in QC, although the only time I miss using them is late fall. The rest of the year worms and leaches work fine.   Thanks for the kind words everyone."
487369,asdve23rveavwa,2010-07-22 02:17:00,2690,"Fantastic family report, Mike!!!  The photos tell a great story, as they should.  Really nice spot, the fishing is just a bonus, from the looks of it!"
