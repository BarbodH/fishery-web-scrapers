I was by myself so I tried to hold the fish out as far as I could and snap the picture but it really didn't work too well  anyways here are a couple of them        I hope to get out a few more times before sunday when I go on my fly-in with cochrane air , I am really pumped for that"

488336,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-07-26 00:34:00,0,"That second one looks like it has some weight!Fat free shad you say? I bought that lure, thanks to the constant infomercials by Bill Dance. It sits in my tackle box and have yet to use it!Looks great for murky water."
488341,Terry,2010-07-26 00:49:00,14456,"I lost my last one today, citrus colour ....the large size..sure would like to find more"
488356,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-07-26 01:26:00,0,Mine is citrus colored too. How much you willing to pay?  We should have an OFC Lure swap or sale. I have so many lures and stuff I dont need or use.
