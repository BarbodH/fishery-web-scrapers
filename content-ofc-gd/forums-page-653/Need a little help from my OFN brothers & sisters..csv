488669,DRIFTER_016,2010-07-26 22:13:00,10439,I made another video after the success I had with my Ice Road Fishers video and this one is currently looking good to win in the summer video contest. The video was shot of the course of several hours on the Whitefish River in the NWT and features hungry pike attacking home made topwater lures constructed from aluminum cigar tubes. So if you could take some time to have a look and maybe vote and post a comment if you have a minute I would be most grateful. You need to register to vote or comment though but it's no different than registering on youtube or photobucket.  Exciting Topwater Pike Video Thanks for your support it is muchly appreciated!!!
