488519,DRIFTER_016,2010-07-26 16:02:00,10439,I don't know about you guys but I hate having to deal with ads in the middle of a post. What say you?
488525,danbouck,2010-07-26 16:07:00,4380,I believe they are only in the classifieds
488527,JohnF,2010-07-26 16:11:00,3494, Or if you don't log in.  JF
488528,BillsTheBassMan,2010-07-26 16:11:00,932,"Yeah, I haven't seen them in GD for quite some time now."
488547,Roy,2010-07-26 16:38:00,13728,"Yup, log in and you won't have that problem. There is one ad per thread in the classifieds sub forum. The very few ads that are here help to pay the bills."
488551,alexcba,2010-07-26 16:41:00,634,"i dont really mind them at all. i used to run a forum and advertising is money. be it a banner, or a single posting in a thread. plus its not like the ads aren't relevant to fishing or the outdoors.. i could understand if it was a snickers bar ad but lol haven't seen one of those yet."

488558,alexcba,2010-07-26 16:57:00,634,lmao! ahh thanks roy! theres espresso all over my lap top now.
488559,TC1OZ,2010-07-26 16:57:00,987,I am currently logged in and about 2 pages ago there was a double banner ad (which is over kill in my opinion). One of the ads was relevant to fishing. The other was about hooking up with males in my town. My wife might enjoy that but I think its just plain disgusting.....
488564,Roy,2010-07-26 17:04:00,13728,"TC10Z, we don't have that stuff on here. That has to do with your computer. "
488567,Tarzan's Jane,2010-07-26 17:08:00,1183,Uh Oh...wifey just got busted.  lmao
488568,alexcba,2010-07-26 17:12:00,634,yeah the ads are search engine based lol. so what ever you searched on the comp is whats gonna pop up if theres a big market for it.
488570,DRIFTER_016,2010-07-26 17:28:00,10439,Yeah for some reason I was logged out. That's why I was seeing them thar ads.
488572,Guest LivingLegend,2010-07-26 17:35:00,0,"Mmmmmmmm, snickers bar. Im gonna go out and get one. DARN THOSE AD's!  "
488639,TC1OZ,2010-07-26 20:32:00,987," For your information, it was from your google ad banner. And the way it said ""hook up"" I assume it thought it was a fishing ad. I look at porn, that's what the internet is for. But it sure as hell isn't dude on dude.....  And the wife has her own computer... Just fixed a virus on it last week. I'll clear my cookies and see if that helps."
488640,alexcba,2010-07-26 20:40:00,634," if you type in something into your search engine on google it will track the things you search for most and show them to you in an ad on this and other forums that use google ads. not saying you search ""dude on dude"" but maybe if you've searched porn then it will hit any kind of porn, including the same sex variety.. atleast some dude on sheep ad didnt show up LOL!"
488643,TC1OZ,2010-07-26 20:55:00,987," I know the address by heart, its in recent history hahahaha. I just start typing myfree....and it pops up! I can only assume one of the links it takes me to must of left a dirty cookie of some sort...."
488645,alexcba,2010-07-26 20:57:00,634,bahahhahahaha!  thats good enough to be in my signature as a qoute!
488646,TC1OZ,2010-07-26 20:58:00,987, What can you say... I'm not ashamed of much.
488680,aplumma,2010-07-26 23:12:00,6896,Since it brings in a little money to pay for the bandwidth and software it is a small price to pay for a free members forum. I would actually vote for a few more ads if it would fund something for all of the time the mods put into this place. Since that will not happen I guess they will have to make do with a Thanks for a good job and a hearty handshake.   Art
