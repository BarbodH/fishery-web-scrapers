488243,beertech,2010-07-25 17:25:00,118,which direction does the wind blow on erie to make port maitland area the roughest
488256,HTHM,2010-07-25 18:08:00,4082,The west
488267,Spiel,2010-07-25 19:05:00,9065,The direction is not as important as the wind speed. Even a brisk northerly wind can make it rough if you're far enough off shore.
488314,canadadude,2010-07-25 23:19:00,769,"West or Southwest can be brutal, you don't need to travel nearly as far out as other Ports to get into deeper water."
488447,pikehunter,2010-07-26 13:07:00,1659,"Like CanadaDave said you want N. N/W, and don't turn your back to the lake. Keep your senses alert for wind changes and time of day after 11 AM things seem to change. Also don't trust the wind forecast on the weather channel or their website. I have read wind predictions for there more than once only to be foiled after getting to the port.  Have a good day on the lake."
488450,bucktail,2010-07-26 13:17:00,1857,"SW and West are the worst, doesnt take much a breeze to get the rollers going. It does have a habit of sitting down from 9-11 am until the heat builds on shore and it gets going again. Looking to get out there later this week , would appreciate any recent reports.   Thanks  darren"
