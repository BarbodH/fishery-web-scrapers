488263,Beans,2010-07-25 18:38:00,3339,"I didn't know shoal carp (muskies) liked corn...  Carp fishing with Crappieperchhunter this morning held a big surprise to both of us...a little after 10:00 AM I decided it was time to renew the ground bait on my spring feeder...as I picked up my rod from its holders I thought I was snagged but all of a sudden my snag started to head downstream...""Hey Steve, I think I got a fish but it doesn't feel like a carp""  Then all of a sudden I get a drag screaming run...""maybe it is a carp""...I no sooner get the words out of my mouth when a musky makes a gigantic leap out of the water...""Nope it's not a carp"" I sez...  After a nice battle, with several big runs, (all the while laughing our heads off) we manage to get it into shore and Steve unhooked it without taking it out of the water...about an 8 to 10 pounder we guessed...  What a great way to christain my new telescopic 13' carp rod I got last Thursday...  We had no sign of any carp until Steve got an eleventh hour one about 20 lbs...  Shortly after he left (I stayed on as my wife was going to a quilt show in Haliburton) the carp gods must have taken pity on this old carper as I hooked my personal best...had to go well over 25 lbs and took forever to bring to shore to  unhook and release...  Too bad we don't carry our cameras with us anymore...but I must have over a hundred pics of him or I with a carp...  To celebrate, I bought myself a couple of those chicken ceasar wraps from Timothy Horton's...tasty morsels them..."
488265,Terry,2010-07-25 18:51:00,14456,always a surprise when you get one of them on the line  and cool that you landed it ..of course I have fished for muskie 4 days and have not caught one yet..just not fair...LOL
488271,MJL,2010-07-25 19:29:00,2427,"Congrats on the new PB carp...As for muskies, I've had a few run-ins with them up in the Kawarthas while fishing for carp...They ended up grabbing and stealing my method feeders while I was reeling them in"
488283,Sandbag,2010-07-25 20:52:00,533,"Awesome Beans...gotta love little surprizes like that.  To me that is half the fun of fishing, the unknown that has you and a friend laughing.  Bet you'll never forget that!  Nice job Beans  Cheers  Craig"
488286,Dozer,2010-07-25 20:58:00,896,
488299,bigugli,2010-07-25 21:57:00,6138,Congrats on the surprise catch. Good to hear you and Steve had a great day.
488303,motv8tr,2010-07-25 22:21:00,2587,"Huh, pretty cool there Norm, glad you were able to land both and even more important get down and unhook your new PB Carp!!!  Congrats!  Maureen"
488308,crappieperchhunter,2010-07-25 22:39:00,2582,"Yep... one of those "" You had to see it to believe it things"".   Truly sorry I didn't have the camera today   Would have loved a money shot of a musky with  pineapple monster maise stuck in  his face and the wire feeder hanging down  The bite was dreadful until then, but that sure made up for it. It was a beautiful clean fish as well. Too bad it was under 44 or we could have had Muskie steaks on the BBQ  Sorry I missed your PB carp my friend. But as you know I left Debbe at the cottage  doing the laundry and to finish painting the Muskoka chair so I figured the LEAST I could do was be home for lunch on time.  Again an event I was happy to be present for. Might be awhile before either of us see that again."

488321,Leecher,2010-07-25 23:55:00,7832,Good going Beans Congrats on the ski and PB Memories of a life time Thanks for sharing Leechman
488461,Beans,2010-07-26 13:42:00,3339, Hey Mike...I can see a ski mistaking a method feeder for a spinner or a buzz bait but what would a spring feeder represent?...Maybe it omits a vibration of sorts...LOL
488464,alexcba,2010-07-26 13:51:00,634,the shape a spring feeder could have been mistaken for a fish.. its not to far fetched to think so. the sudden movement made by you lifting the rod could have triggered a reaction strike.  good going by the way
488521,BillsTheBassMan,2010-07-26 16:02:00,932,That's a pretty epic story beans - thanks for sharing.  I started carp fishing about a week ago and I've got into lots of catfish and a LMB.  I don't suspect I'll ever catch a Musky on corn . . . but I guess ya never know.
488532,Victor,2010-07-26 16:16:00,1609, I guess we won't know until one of us puts 2 treble hooks onto a spring feeder and work it with some musky gear !!  Congrats on the PB!
