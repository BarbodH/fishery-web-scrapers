I haven't been out there in 5 years or so. just a plain old 16 foot tinner with a 9hp or better would do the job.  any suggestions would be greatly appreciated,  Reeelsmokin"

486251,JoshS,2010-07-18 16:35:00,729,I remember Wedgewood Marina used to rent them but then I just googled this place: http://www.rubyscottages.com/amenities.html  With boat rentals its all about how late they late you stay out.
