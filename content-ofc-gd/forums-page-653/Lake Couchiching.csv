486658,Drock6687,2010-07-20 01:01:00,90,"hey everyone...myself and my buddy are planning on goung to lake couchinching for the frist time in 2 weeks for 2 days.  I was just wondering if anyone can help out with any info the have about the lake?  we where can launch our smaller boat (12 ft), what fish can we expect to find and where to go?  thanks for any info or advice you may have!"
486762,misfish,2010-07-20 14:16:00,29133,You both becareful out there with a 12ft tinny.
486767,Headhunter,2010-07-20 14:30:00,5703,"There's a launch on ""Airport Road"" just past casino Rama... I believe is free. Good luck and as Brian says, be sure to pick your days in a 12 ft tinny. HH"
486809,steverowbotham,2010-07-20 16:13:00,1800,I will 3rd that.  a small tin boat on Cooch can be dangerous.  Be careful out there!
486811,motion,2010-07-20 16:21:00,403, Where are you staying?
486817,markiemark70,2010-07-20 16:33:00,158,Just curious why is everyone saying be careful? There are larger bodies of water in Ontario than Couch. Is there something unique that makes this body of water more dangerous?  Thanks
486835,Tybo,2010-07-20 17:53:00,1373,"It's a shallow lake,Deepest spot is 27 feet.A mind wind can make it very rough. Also a part of the Trent Severn waterway.Lots of big boats going up/down the lake."
486863,DanD,2010-07-20 19:45:00,2223,"Yea my brother crossed couch a couple of times, while doing the Trent. He's usually not too afraid of a bit of rough water; but he said he wouldnâ€™t cross it again on a windy day. I guess he had water breaking over the bow of his 28 foot cabin cruiser. The same wind on Erie wouldn't have put a two foot chop on the water and Erie's known for being rough, during a bit of wind.  Dan."
486869,misfish,2010-07-20 20:03:00,29133,"Im sure Steve can attest to this one. Were out there in 18-20 foot boats.Big bad ass crussiers come through not just one,but 2 or three.You slow down,you dont jump them wakes.It,s amazing how much water those things push.  And yes,it doesnt take much to get that lake rolling from light winds due to the shallowness."
486882,BillsTheBassMan,2010-07-20 21:01:00,932,Lake Couchaching actually means The Lake of Many Winds in a native dialect.
486889,misfish,2010-07-20 21:16:00,29133, TY BTBM.
487003,Drock6687,2010-07-21 01:28:00,90,OK well it sounds like we may have picked a bad lake to try... we live in cambridge so we dont want to drive any farther then 3 hours or so...any other recomendations for different lakes in our small boat?
487014,Cudz,2010-07-21 01:52:00,2652,"Couch is great for fishing, it just get real real choppy really fast.  Big boats as well going through the trent.  What about six mile lake.  Lots of small bays and protected areas.  Just get a map first."
487039,Drock6687,2010-07-21 02:59:00,90, where is six mile lake?
487059,Cudz,2010-07-21 04:01:00,2652,"up 400 extention about not too much further than couch.  I would say an extra half hour (different hwy).  There is a decent national park there as well for camping.  large and smallmouth, pike and some walleye if you can find them."
487089,steverowbotham,2010-07-21 11:48:00,1800,"Six Mile is a good lake.  There are also some really good lakes close by Cooch if you do happen to get windy days.  Lake St. John is right there, Sparrow Lake, Bass Lake, Kashe Lake are all within a 10-25 minute drive of Cooch."
487143,Toddyc20,2010-07-21 14:24:00,141,Lake Dalrymple is full of weeds but it is also close to there and has tons of fish in it.  Lots of bass and pike from my experience.
487214,BillsTheBassMan,2010-07-21 17:06:00,932,"Sounds like you've got a full menu of lakes Drock, now you just have to pick one and fish it.  Good luck."
487621,Drock6687,2010-07-23 01:54:00,90,ya it sounds like i have some research to do...really i just wanna go somewhere and catch some fish...i dont really even care what kind!
487625,livinisfishin,2010-07-23 02:01:00,661,Would u guys eat fish from bass lake?
487794,BillsTheBassMan,2010-07-23 16:17:00,932, Nope . . . but I don't eat Bass . . . seems kind of sacreligious.
487987,Cudz,2010-07-24 04:37:00,2652,Me either.  Don't eat bass.  If i want to eat fish I go out on Simcoe for a half hour and catch perch.
488080,livinisfishin,2010-07-24 20:35:00,661,Do you often get those 1lbers?
