I just returned form a week at a Kawartha Lake that starts with a ""C"" and is between Sturgeon and Balsam lakes. But in the new era of conservation and confidentiality, I don't want to say more than that. The fishing was really quite good and next week we are off to ""Big (the name of a female deer, but I can't say more than that)"". Have a good day all! Jim"
