I have a small boat and i fish alone sometimes so i think this is the one i want.  Is this net good for fish that roll in the net?  Thanks for any replies.  http://www.beckmannet.com/acatalog/Pen_Fin_Saver_Nets.html"

488216,Sinker,2010-07-25 15:43:00,8692,"There is really only one way to find out  That net is plenty big enough. I find I can release them at the side of the boat quicker than putting them in the net anyways. Maybe not a 50""er, but anything up to say 42"" just gets the hooks popped/cut at boatside.  S."

488224,glen,2010-07-25 16:16:00,2641,Thanks for the replies.  I will be ordering one in.  Buying it site unseen i wanted to make sure it will work.  Dax my boat is small and if the 30x39 will do the job i will go with it.
