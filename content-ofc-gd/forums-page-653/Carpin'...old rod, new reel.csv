488340,alexcba,2010-07-26 00:49:00,634,very nice!
488343,LefroyFisherman,2010-07-26 00:54:00,602,Some weird scales on that carp
488346,Paully,2010-07-26 01:00:00,712, cause its a mirror carp..
488347,MJL,2010-07-26 01:01:00,2427,Sweet!  Beautiful carp.  That fully scaled mirror is pretty wild.  Very cool rod…Is it made of bamboo? Fiberglass?  Really appreciate this post.  Makes me want to grab my pin and head to the local river for some carp – something I haven’t done for about 3yrs or so.
488348,alexcba,2010-07-26 01:02:00,634,i've caught quite a few of those.. mirror carp i think.
488350,Bill Shearer,2010-07-26 01:10:00,456,"The rod is bamboo. The mirror carpis not all that rare, but certainly interesting."
488352,MJL,2010-07-26 01:14:00,2427, Awesome...Carping legends like Chris Yates and the late Richard Walker would be proud
488355,Leecher,2010-07-26 01:25:00,7832,Carp on a pin    Sounds like fun.... Great job floatman55
488417,Bill Shearer,2010-07-26 11:11:00,456,"Sorry, but the fish were caught by a friend. I just posted the photos for interests sake."
488505,BillsTheBassMan,2010-07-26 15:27:00,932,"That's a sweet rod and a nice report . . . thanks for sharing!  I just started carping, I've only caught 5 carp now, but two of them were mirror carp, so they must not be THAT rare.  Ryan"
488535,MJL,2010-07-26 16:22:00,2427," Depends where you go and at what size.  Some places have a better mirror/common ratio than others.  For most places I fish, I get 1 mirror (over 10lbs) for every 200 or so commons.  There are a couple ponds I know of where you can get 1 mirror for roughly every 10-20 commons but they are only 1/2lb-3lbs or so.  In the UK, the reverse is true where mirrors are more common than common carp"
488537,BillsTheBassMan,2010-07-26 16:26:00,932, I've been estimating the mirrors I've been catching in the 4 to 5 pound range.
488549,Victor,2010-07-26 16:39:00,1609,Great pics and that mirror is amazing. Definitely one of the better looking ones I've seen.
488638,dsn,2010-07-26 20:22:00,1018,I prefer the common. I find mirrors interesting to look at but alittle to slimmy to handle.   dsn
