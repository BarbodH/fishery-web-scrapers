I've got a swivel on each of the 2 front benches and one on the battery box lid, 14 years, still holding.  I used the aluminum track system, one track bolted through the front curled edge on one side and used #10 self tapping screws for the other side of the track that sits about 2 inches back from the front edge.  The drivers seat is mounted on a removeable swivel bolted through the battery box lid with a piece of 3/4 ply as a stiffener and to move it a bit closer to the tiller."
