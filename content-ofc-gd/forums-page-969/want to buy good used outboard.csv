247436,SlowPoke,2008-09-07 18:13:00,2984,Tough call Rob... I think if I were dealing in that kind of money/warrenty ($3000-$5000) I would want to deal with a dealer. You might get lucky with kijiji.com with someone upgrading or they could be dumping a problematic motor.  I'll keep an eye out for you.  -Brian
247483,aplumma,2008-09-07 21:54:00,6896,I vote dealer just for the warrentee I would suspect that the market for good to great  used motors are pretty small.  Art
247487,Pigeontroller,2008-09-07 22:02:00,2793,"Problem is, most motors in that year of 4 stroke are either kept or traded in to a dealer...I bet its tough to find one private."
