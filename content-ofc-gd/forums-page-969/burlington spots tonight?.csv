247243,Mattones,2008-09-06 22:41:00,587, That is indeed a good spot fpr carp fishing. All around the Skyway. You may even run into a Salmon if your lucky.

247249,Rich,2008-09-06 23:00:00,3927,Bronte's where I'd be if I lived there!
247252,hammercarp,2008-09-06 23:18:00,964,"There's Lasalle Park ( take Waterdown Rd. south off the 403). Good carp, largemouth and panfish. The pier below the Skyway ( take Eastport off the QEW) lakeside for salmon, bayside for sheephead, channels and panfish. Hope this helps."
