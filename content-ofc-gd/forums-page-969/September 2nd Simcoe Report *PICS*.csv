Cal and I had to work today, but we got on the water by about 4:30 and fished til 7:15  In those 3 ""ish"" hours of fishing, I had the most fun I've ever had while fishing!  Cal and I caught almost 30 fish, all between 3 and 5 pounds, literally nothing smaller than 3.  Absolutely incredible day on the water.  Finesse was key with the glass flat water, but they were eating if you slowed down enough.      Awesome Day!  I will never forget it"
246078,steverowbotham,2008-09-03 01:40:00,1800,"P.S. The top fish was released before our ""final photos"" because she was hooked kind of deep and didnt want to risk holding her in a livewell if we didnt have to"
