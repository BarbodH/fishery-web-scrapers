245955,rhare,2008-09-02 21:42:00,387,I was down in Port D fishing the king of the lake. Needless to say I am no king. Infact I had a real tough time finding any kings at all. The fishing for the Scotty was slow. Some real nice boxes of fish did get weighed in. I managed a 10# king saturday and only rainbows sunday. Great tourny though.  On Monday I fished the blue zone for some rainbows. Managed 3 kings ( no doubt) and 12+ bows. I guess it kind of made up for the crappy weekend. One of the bows was just over 15# a new PB for me. It had a lamprey stuck on it that I beat to death in the boat. Its tail was so thick I could hardly get a grip on it. fished 400fow down 35-70 all fish on spinnies and flies. carmel dolphin/hawg wild and green dolphin/mirage worked best.  here's a few pics enjoy.  Ryan      My new PB just over 15lbs

246241,rhare,2008-09-03 16:56:00,387,"The over all went to a U.S team from olcott team double play, Tom Letcher.   I think team Striker won the overall series."
246681,Ramble,2008-09-04 19:13:00,713,"Beutiful fish. I got a few weird looks from around the computer lab when I read ""It had a lamprey stuck on it that I beat to death in the boat. "" and started laughing.  Keep up the good work.  -R-"
