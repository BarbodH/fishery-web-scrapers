246934,Reef Runner,2008-09-05 15:07:00,980,"Oh man, that's one of the most beautiful places on earth    Hope there is an expedious clean up."
246951,steve_paul,2008-09-05 15:48:00,658,  Leaving for a week up there in about 5 hours.  Looks like minimal bathing for the week - should be fun cuddling with momma if the weather turns cold.
246953,Wendel,2008-09-05 16:03:00,213, A truck overturned by accident and you hope there is a hefty fine? How about you hope the driver is okay and makes it home to his family?
246955,BillM,2008-09-05 16:15:00,17367,  I am sure if there was a death or even a severe injury it would have been mentioned in the article.  And yeah I think there should be a fine if the driver was in anyway careless..
246966,Tie Twist,2008-09-05 17:05:00,10,Where abouts is that bridge?
246977,Raf,2008-09-05 17:33:00,3495,it crosses the little french.  the little french and everything below five fingers rapids (where the little french dumps into the main river) would be affected
246984,Dano,2008-09-05 18:04:00,719,"Probably a drop in the bucket compared to what is leaching out of undersized, non maintained and yes, even non existant cottage septic beds, septic tanks and holding tanks in the area, never mind outhouses."
246986,bucktail,2008-09-05 18:16:00,1857,Dano is exactly right! Still a brown trout run in the fall shouldnt look like that!
246996,highdrifter,2008-09-05 18:41:00,2534,Holly shnikes I fish that area in Dokis!  That's right close to Monetville and Lakair...  Hope this doesn't smell trouble...  I'm gonna phone my uncle Terry and find out what the rhubarb is..  Thanks for the news.  HD
247011,Wild,2008-09-05 19:34:00,704,Looking forward to your fishing reports guys        yeah yeah yeah feel free to leave out the crappy details
247013,Almontefisher,2008-09-05 19:54:00,18, Just think though you would have your trout and corn dinner to boot  This is not as bad as what has happened to the river here in Ottawa over the last few years...try at least 10 times that much has spilled in the river from our city sewage plants.  The carp are happy though
247043,Grimace,2008-09-05 22:56:00,2020,That sucks.     Peanut backed brown trout everywhere
247046,F7Firecat,2008-09-05 23:23:00,347,Just think how big the muskies will be next year from eating all the corn stuffed baitfish!  yumm yumm flavo flavo
247047,Billy Bob,2008-09-05 23:27:00,5865,This fall the Crappie fishing should be the best ever  :<)
247130,CLofchik,2008-09-06 13:51:00,854,"Wasn't there another derailment lower down last month?  Jeebus, how bad are the tracks around there?"
247141,Billy Bob,2008-09-06 14:32:00,5865," Actually the report says it was a ""TRUCK"" that was involved not a rail car. As far as the railroad (30 year retired railroader) crap  happens."
