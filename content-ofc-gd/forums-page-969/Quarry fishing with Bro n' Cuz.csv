Joonmoon was the master of baby bass today catching this smallie.  And this largie on jig & grub and jig & powerleech.  Walleyeguy had a 2ft pike landed but by the time I got the camera out, it had wiggled away.  I lost a decent smallie on a jump and had to make due with half a dozen WGSF and the beautiful weather and warm water. Nice to get out again with walleyeguy and joonmoon. If I didn't have to go in to work at 3pm we'd probably still be out there."

246622,MARK69,2008-09-04 15:51:00,24,Nice pics...  I know exactly the quarry you were at...No security chase you out??? Did you see any of the 40 lbs. carp that cruise around in there like submarines???
246649,jediangler,2008-09-04 17:12:00,1923,"No FnF, we didn't see the giant carp or any security. I think they only patrol on weekends once the kids get back to school."
