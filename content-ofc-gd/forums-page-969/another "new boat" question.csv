246466,Rizzo,2008-09-04 02:33:00,4754,"First off, thanks to all those who eased my mind a few weeks ago when I thought I had trashed my new boat within 20 minutes of getting it on the water. Turns out it was just a spun hub and all is now well. Never had a motor heavy enough to warrant a transom saver, but this one (50hp 4 stroke) came with one.  Should I be keeping the motor tilted on the transom saver when the boat is in storage, or should I return the motor to a vertical position once the drive home is over?"
246473,danbo,2008-09-04 02:43:00,2646,Quit fiddling with it..lol.  Store your engine vertical at the end of the year when you winterize it.
246485,Greencoachdog,2008-09-04 03:05:00,8163,"Keep the transom saver in the prone position Rizz!  I tilt my motor all the way up and all the way down 2 or 3 times every time I go out during freezing weather to drain all of the water out of it, but always put it back on the transom saver."
246665,mattmacewan,2008-09-04 18:22:00,18,"Rizzo,  We have the same kicker '03 motor on an 16"" 02 Lund.  I dont have a transom saver and that's a different debate but I trailer it with a 2x8 tilted in the mount bracket.  During the winter I store the motor vertical.  During the season either in water or dry I keep it tilted, there is a tilt lock on my transom mount that I use to ease the load on the hydraulics.  It's a relatively light motor so I don't think there is a load of strain on the transom either way compared to the forces applied during a hole shot...  Our manual says to store the motor with the left side facing up between starts.  So stop, trim down, turn wheel all the way right or tiller left and trim up so the left motor casing is up, then store.  I definitely notice it's easier to start vs tilted up or tilted & left - keeps the carb dry from gas dripping in if it's tilted (I'm not 100% sure if that's correct but it's something along those lines.)  Either way I think you're fine...but I prefer to keep it tilted all the time to avoid...ummm...launch ""incidents."""
246705,PERCHER,2008-09-04 20:38:00,787,I always keep my motor in the vertical posistion when sitting in the driveway.It keeps the water drained and the oil where it should be(it's a 4 stroke).I only use the transom saver when in transit. Dan
246711,Rizzo,2008-09-04 21:03:00,4754, thats what I was thinking and why I asked the question...but most of the responses have said keep it tilted. I guess either way can be right depending on what your priorioties are (save transom/hydraulics or keep fluids where they belong0
246724,misfish,2008-09-04 21:34:00,29133,"During the fishing season,leaving it on the transom saver, it,s not a big deal. When you winterize (properly),leaving it on the saver is not bad either,but it,s to each it,s own. It wont make a dif Riz."
246780,Bernie,2008-09-05 00:39:00,3190,Leave it down. Water can collect in the lower unit and freeze if outdoors. It also keeps the gears covered in oil.
246863,Dartee,2008-09-05 11:51:00,47,"For me, I take the saver off when in the garage over the season, if the boat is outside, I leave it on.  It comes down to available space. When on, I can't close the garage door.  For storing over the winter, I take it off"
246962,forrest,2008-09-05 16:39:00,1032,"As stated before, keeping it in the running position lets the water drain.  Water in motor + freezing temp = bad.  Make a good habit of putting it vertical in the driveway.  That way you will never get caught by freezing weather and 100% water.  Oh...and leave it in neutral.  Forrest"
246963,Billy Bob,2008-09-05 16:39:00,5865,When even NOT is use my motor is vertical for the last 23 years on my boat. It's a 50 hp Johnson.  It is tilted about 45 degrees with a piece of wood to block it up while towing.  A 50 hp is not that heavy of a motor on the transom unless you have a bad transom to begin with.  Bob
246983,Wild,2008-09-05 18:04:00,704,When in doubt follow manufacturers recommendations
