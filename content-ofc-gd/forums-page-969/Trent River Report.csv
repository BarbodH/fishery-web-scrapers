246576,PatrickGG,2008-09-04 13:44:00,562,"Hit the Trent River in search of some fish yesterday with Johnnybass we got on the water around 6:30 and started hitting weed edges in search of some Largemouth and Smallies we also hoped we can bag some Walleyes but that did not happen, the weather was really cool in the Morning but as the sun started to rise it got really hot, Johnny hits off the first fish of the morning working Drop offs outside the weed lines  Shortly after i hook into a largemouth sitting in standing weeds  we continued on the same line and Johnny hits another smallie on a top water Bait  Than it happens to me AGAIN, I worked a area that had Over Hanging standing weeds with a wacky rig and i nailed a decent largemouth i get her to the boat and i felt confident enough to lift her into the boat since i have 16 pound Stren magnathin line on my reel what happens?? My line snaps    ""never buying stren line again   "" so we carry on and at this point i sat and smoked to calm my nerves, we enter a small bay with lots of weeds and johnny nails a Largie and a Smallie   we worked for our fish the rest of the day the heat was a major factor we boated so many 1 and 2 pounder i lost count and we moved and tried areas and slop basically just pulled little guys out here and there, we moved back down to the area where we started in the morning working a outside drop off with docks up on shore and i got a hit, Here i go working this fish to the boat and low and behold i can't even count the smallies pursuing this one hooked fish and they were all decent size fish, i wasnt sure at this point if i needed help to net this fish and johnny helps out in doing so, a decent smallie  she goes back in the water, i cast and i get another hit this time it's a bigger one i struggled and Johnny's telling me my drag is to loose he's telling me this and at that point it's like planes Flying over my head i should have tightened the drag the fish bulldoged into the weeds i get her out but she spits the hook   and the school is gone   oh well now its 2 big fish lost in one outing, through out the day we hit fish after fish smallies, rock bass largies, overall the day was great and the weather was hot and it began to feel like summer was finally here  cant wait to get out again."

246581,tbayboy,2008-09-04 13:58:00,1497,"Too funny.  Anyhow, nice report, looks like you got into enough fish to make loosing one or two not so bad.  Congrats on a nice day."

246639,Leecher,2008-09-04 16:40:00,7832,Great report and pics PatrickG  You guys sure got into a lot of quality bass.....loads of fun when the bite is on  Great job and thanks for sharing Leechman
246661,cpguy29,2008-09-04 18:16:00,148,"Great report guys. We did pretty good on the Bog too. Early bite was awesome, walleye and bass, report coming. I figured you would have went to Simcoe for the smallies with the low wind."
246673,Guest Johnny Bass,2008-09-04 18:39:00,0,"Great report! The reason I have my shirt on in those pics is we just stopped taking pictures once the sun came up. I got cooked! The hairs on my arms started to rise!  Anyways, it was another great fishing day. I've always wanted to fish lake Seymour, and since the last time, we broke down.... Opted to try again.  Got there and it was COLD in the morning with no wind. Patrick brings me to a mouth watering weed line.On goes the pop R with only 2 hooks left on the back treble. I get 2 smallies in the boat. Patrick is nailing the largies wacky rigging. So I go to a 1/4 ounce jig and pig. Nailed a few small ones and that decent largie you see. I finally went today and picked up some 3/8 ouncers, so hopefully now I will get more fish on them.  Picked up a lot of fish on tubes,worms,flukes,grubs,ect...  Then we decided to abandon the weedline pattern and go to Patrick's smallie spot and then drift down. Got there and there was nothing going on. We decided to drift a deep channel. I was dragging a grub and picking up smallies but nothing big.  Then the sun came up and was really cooking us and the bite slowed down. Only puny fish were being caught here and there.  We also tried working the slop for an hour. Only produced small fish so we abandoned the pattern.  Patrick suggests we try a certain shoreline. We start casting and wack! Patrick gets a hit! Its a decent smallie and there are all kinds of smallies going crazy around it. I thought about throwing out my lure to catch one but opted to land Patrick's fish first.  After that Patrick hits another one but lost it in the weeds and the hook popped out. Then the school disappeared. There was this certain wake boarder that only seemed to come out and wake board when we were fishing near his property. When we left he would go back in.  We were headed back for the weedline we worked in the morning but I decide to forget the weedline and head for Lake Seymour. Looked around only to discover most of the lake did not look fishable.....I guess if you wanted to throw spinner baits all day you could. So we opted to go back near the launch.  Over all it was a pretty good day. It was more of a numbers day than a size day, but I finally fished a lake that I have been wanting to fish for awhile.  For all you carp fisherman?Get yourself over to the TRENT! There were schools and schools of carp that jumped all day long!!!!"
