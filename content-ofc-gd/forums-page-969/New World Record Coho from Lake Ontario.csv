246814,John Bacon,2008-09-05 02:21:00,3277,Looks like the coho world record has once again been set with another Lake Ontario fish.  http://www.great-lakes.org/8-23-98.html   Thanks to ccmt for finding a more up to date link ;-)  http://www.salmoncrazy.com/2008/09/04/deta...hotos-and-more/

246822,ccmtcanada,2008-09-05 03:13:00,7971,Hmmm...the date on the article is Aug 1998...10 years ago.  I did see an article from this summer saying someone caught a 34.1 lbs http://www.salmoncrazy.com/2008/09/04/deta...hotos-and-more/  At any rate.....they are both HUGE fish!
246857,rhare,2008-09-05 11:26:00,387,Im pretty sure it was broke twice in the last couple weeks. Both fish came from the American side. They are now testing to make sure they are not chinny/coho hybred.
246878,bucktail,2008-09-05 13:02:00,1857,Awesome fish! Wonder why Lake O spits them out like that?
246888,Leecher,2008-09-05 13:19:00,7832,Great looking fish Thanks for sharing Leechman
246978,canadadude,2008-09-05 17:35:00,769,Simple it's the greatest fishery in the world
246990,CLofchik,2008-09-05 18:22:00,854, Lot's of bait this year=lot's of big fish.  Salmon are definitely running bigger this year.  FYI the Lake O record king came out from infront of the same river.  They get lot's of big fish up the Salmon R.
247162,canadadude,2008-09-06 16:18:00,769,"They also have the premier Lake Ontario hatchery, it truely is an awsome fishery not only for Salmon but Browns and Steelies"
247190,fishindevil,2008-09-06 17:54:00,6254,"A fish of a lifetime for sure !!!!   congrats to the guy who caught him !!!! my biggest coho to date is just over 18lbs,and even that is a very big coho !!!!"
