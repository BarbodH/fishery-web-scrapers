246671,glen,2008-09-04 18:34:00,2641,Do it need to reserve a camping spot and a place to dock my boat for the G2G.  Thanks.
246674,Whopper,2008-09-04 18:41:00,2174,I would if you want to make sure you get a spot. It's no big deal to reserve one just email Kevin and tell him what you want and dates.  Maybe since I nothing to do with this I shouldn't have answered the question   but then again I try to help where I can.  Cheers
