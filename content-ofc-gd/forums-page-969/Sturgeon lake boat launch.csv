247041,Jonaton,2008-09-05 22:52:00,72,I am heading up to sturgeon lake this Sunday and have only ever used launches in the northern part of the lake. Does anyone have any suggestions for a launch in the southern part of the lake? Any help would be greatly appreciated.  Cheers Jonaton

247082,ccmtcanada,2008-09-06 01:38:00,7971,"Moorings at Snug Harbour has a good launch.  I believe the launch fee is 8 or 10 bucks, but the ramp is pretty good.  From Toronto area....  401 to 35/115 north Take the hwy 35 exit and go north towards Lindsay. Turn right on Hwy 7...go about a kilometer Turn left (north) on hwy 36 (towards Bobcaygeon) Turn left on Snug Harbour Rd (it'll veer off to the right as you approach the lake) Moorings at Snug Harbour boat launch is on the left side...about a kilometer from that right.  There is also a boat launch at Lunge Haven which is basically at that veer....never launched there but I know there is one there.  They are both marked on this map.  Snug Harbour is ""C"" Lunge Haven is ""F""    Good luck"
247109,Jonaton,2008-09-06 04:52:00,72,If we launch at Lindsay do we need to go through the lock or is it on the sturgeon side? Thank you both for your suggestions.
