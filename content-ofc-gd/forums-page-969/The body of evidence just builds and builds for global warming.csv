Did anyone watch the olympics?  How can you even think that bad air quality doesnt affect anything that breathes in an adverse way?  and dont ask me to produce the stats, I already read them, if you dont beleive it, look it up yourself.  Check out Aesthma for one and look at the icrease in incidence over the past few decades and what it is attributed to.  And whoever said poor air quality doesnt kill, air pollution episodes certainly can, its just that they effect the imuno compromised aesthmatics and the weak alot more than average healthy person, similiar to ummmm, Listeriosis, (except aesthma)...has anyone read that in the news lately?"

Whatever is your opinion you will get proof ( then it is proven) of your point of view.  I did it and it worked pretty well, but one day I have the visitor telling me that this recipe is copyrighted and because I’ve missed one ingredient  ( 3 lb of Bull) I have to pay penalty.

Apparently your Hero Al Gore's movie seems to have infiltrated our schools and our gullible young including you without even an examination to the facts.  As far as teachers go, most might be book smart but a lot don't have any common sense or knowledge outside their Environment or their personal views.  I find the most stubborn people are Environmentalists as well as Teachers.  Its too bad that everything that we older people have done has been wrong all these years.  Everything from the environment, your health, your society, your country, even your upbringing.  Its all been wrong hasn't it... Poor little Scuro.  Ill say it again, if your so concerned,  YOU can stop driving, pay for an expensive hybrid if you have to YOU can pay a carbon Tax, YOU can go Neked because production of clothing causes Carbon YOU can pay extra for food, YOU can pay an environmental tax for purchases of TVs, Computers, Fridges etc. YOU can pay extra for home heating, YOU can pay extra at the pumps, YOU can pay the increase in Transported goods, YOU can pay for the Idiots that want to save the Polar bears, YOU can vote for a weak Idiot that cant talk and looks like a 90 lb weakling that wants to punish the Wests economy of which is Natural Resources are now keeping this country above water because he is a loser out here.  In the mean time I'm not buying your crap and I'm hoping all this blows over because, since YOU have been sucked into this Crap, Ive been paying for it.  Tell me this though since you have all the answers, since Ive been paying for all this crap, how come I still got to get rid of my TVs, Freezers and pay for it? How come Oil has gone down 30% but not a cent at the pumps, How do you explain adding another tax to Oil Companies, Home Heating, Mining, Diesel is not going to effect me, BUT CUT DOWN on the WORLDS CARBON EMISSIONS  Explain all that to me Sherlock!!!!!

The above is not ""malarkey"" so stop with the ridicule. Scientists can demonstrate these facts. When we look at these particular facts it creates one piece of evidence in the global warming case. Now if ever greater melting on north pole stops or reverses itself, then one could say the polar cap melting does not go beyond the extremes in variation. If on the other hand we see more melting we are getting beyond the extreme ranges of natural occurances. If it all melts, well then whoooaaa...something that hasn't happened in 50 million years has occured and that can't be explained by natural variation or causes.  So lets drop the subject. Lets wait until next summer and see is this strong trend continues, stops, or reverses itself."
246645,cram,2008-09-04 17:00:00,1733, You're arguing against yourself.

He's pointing out why lifespans are increasing (or one of the reasons) and you're giving a few others.

Folks, forget the photos of ice melting in summer being bandied about by Al Gore and his $300 million dollar advertising budget.  The hard data is in. The Arctic ice sheet has GROWN by an area twice the size of Germany since this time last year.  No doubt Al and his investors, who already built the exchange where carbon-tax credits will be bought and sold once they can snooker you into agreeing to that tax, will now claim that your carbon dioxide is causing global warming cooling and that you are STILL on the hook!

246054,StoneFly,2008-09-03 00:51:00,574,"I think the more alarming concept is 'Climate change'  and associted poor air quality vs. Global warming.  Around 15 years ago when I was studying topics like this in University, it was generally only accepted on a 'Fringe' Scientific basis. Now, worldwide it is accepted as fact.  Even the Auto manufacturers and big oil have condeded and they are the main reasons it wasnt politically accepted in the past.  Nearly similar to how big tobbaco finally admitted that smoking causes cancer etc.  Much more evidence exists for climate change occuring at a rate up to 1000 times faster than nature dictates. We do have long term global warming and cooling and change due to natural cycles, this is well documented.  The rate and unpredictability of current change is what is cause for alarm and anyone who has lived 20, 30 or 40 years or longer shold be able to attest to this even in Ontario.  It is well documented and proven a direct link to what humans have done in the past 100 years or so, to dramatically affect these changes.  Just my opinion, although it is also widely accepted fact.  Perhaps one good thing to come out of artificially rising oil prices has spawned renewed big interest in alternative energy, options that have been around awhile.  Sadly the biggest barriers to implementation was change in infrastrcutre, big oil and politics in bed, as well as consumer intollerance to change and higher everday costs atleast in the shortterm.  The price of oil is now 3x what it was 5-6 years ago so now alternatives especially to oil are much more cost feasible.  Alternative, sustainable energy such as wind, solar, geothermal, bio fuel and biogas from waste products etc. etc.  will over the next 10-20 years become a major source of energy on our planet, it has already started and is accelerating rapidly.  Whatever you want to call it, climate channge or global warming, the human induced factors through emissions alone of which there is no denying also are a very major contributor to negative health effects on all animals including humans.  What everone can do is keep issues like this in mind when it comes to voting and your choice in purchases.  Just my $0.02"
246119,hammercarp,2008-09-03 03:48:00,964," A couple of questions if you don't mind. You have stated that climate change if induced by ""natural causes"" takes place over long periods. How do you explain the brief warm period that allowed the Vikings to settle and farm the coast of Greenland for the breif period of a hundred years or so?  Also the brief mini ice age that occurred a few hundred years ago? These are documented facts as they occured during our period of written history. Secondly if we are suffering negative health effects, how is it that our lifespans have increased over the last hundred years? Don't get me wrong I know the climate is changing. It's that blanket statements like yours do beg for some questions."
246131,John Bacon,2008-09-03 04:49:00,3277," Yes, but the earth had been cooling between 1944 to 1977.  I remember seeing movies in school about how polution was reflecting the sun light back into space and causing a new ice age.  I understand that the earth's temperature has been stable since 1999 and are expected to remain so for the next 15 years.  This could be a blip in a long term increase; or, maybe the end of a short term increase."
246132,cram,2008-09-03 06:27:00,1733," I can't explain his comments for him, but i think the warm period you're referring to lasted hundreds of years (400?).  It was also considered an anomaly, as was the ice age.  I'm not sure if anyone knows why they happened....lots of theories about differences in solar energy (sun spots?), volcanoes (ash in the atmosphere blocking the sun), ocean currents, etc.  Natural cycles do happen.  And, if you're an alien biologist studying earth (or a future non-human historian) I guess you could call this (as in right now) natural as well.  Something i found interesting (and is kind of good news for us) -- national geographic did a neat program (think its on their website as well) called 6 degrees or something like that.  Described  theories on what happens to the world with every 1 degree of increased temperature.  The good part....according to them Canada is basically the best place to be as temperatures warm a little (longer growing season, etc, and the last safe place on hte planet if/when temperatures get really extreme."

The first occurred about 9,000 years ago and again about 7,600 years ago, when there was increased solar radiation.  and The Laurentide sheet, which was almost twice the size of its Greenland cousin, was at its largest about 22,000 years ago when it began its slow decline due to warming temperatures.

245918,cram,2008-09-02 19:34:00,1733," Interesting.  Looks like their theory was the exact opposite -- that the pollution would block the sunlight (versus keep the heat in).  The ice age stuff is pretty speculative but our (warmer) northern temperatures  do depend heavily on that gulf stream, and lots of scientists think it'll get altered when the ice caps melt.  I don't really get why."
245925,bucktail,2008-09-02 19:50:00,1857,Supposedly when the ice melts and releasses fresh water is has a different density then salt water. It is supposed to alter the northern transfer of heat by the gulf stream and divert it to the european coast. Thus making north america colder and starting the cycle all over again. I wouldnt be surprised mother nature has a way of rectifying things. The planet has healed from much worse environmental disasters.....did take many millions of years tho! The earth will be lush and green long after we are all extinct.
