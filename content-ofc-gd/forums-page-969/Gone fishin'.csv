So I took a vacation day to do a little fishing on the Grand in the Caledonia area.  Made it for sun up, jumped into the waders and way I went.   Pretty much had the river all to myself this morning, too, other than this guy.   Although I think I liked his company more than he liked mine.   Got to debut my new rod today too.  Picked up a StCroix 7-foot Premium Series rod they rate medium-lite power and fast action.  It's gotta be able to do a lot of things well on the river from casting spinners to dragging tubes to float fishing, etc.  Pretty much whatever the bass are in the mood for.  I'm pretty happy with its versatility cuz I did have to try a little bit of everything today.  Missed a few with the spinners and tubes so I stared floating worms past their noses and got into a few.   They didn't get much over a foot today but they were plentyful and I managed about 8 or so.   They were a scrappy lot this morning and when they weren't jumping, they'd just dig into that current and give you a good little scrap.   As the sun went higher, the bass bite died off but the Mooneye began to hit and I was able to catch a couple of them too.   Another highlight of the day was watching an Osprey working the water just down stream from me.  Man, those things are huge and watching 'em dive into the water after their meal is really a thrill.  A good day today and maybe I'll have to take tomorrow off too! "

246488,bigugli,2008-09-04 03:08:00,6138,Beautiful spot to fish. Glad you enjoyed the day.
246493,timmeh,2008-09-04 03:50:00,609,"Sounds like a good day. I think you'll really like the St. Croix. I bought the exact same rod at the start of year, mostly with the idea of using it for bass fishing the Grand, plus other similar rivers, and it's been great. It's also worked well for me casting for browns in the upper grand too."
246494,jediangler,2008-09-04 03:57:00,1923,You gotta love Grand river smallies. Thanks for posting.
246509,sharper,2008-09-04 05:09:00,279,Great report sounds like you had a great day on the grand. I was fishing the grand near Paris the other day and managed one baby bass to show.
246559,The Urban Fisherman,2008-09-04 13:07:00,2050,"awesome day on the water dude - I didn't know mooneye were readily available!  cheers, UF"
246587,Mike Pike,2008-09-04 14:14:00,1332,"Ya, some flyfishers like heading to Caledonia to fish for 'em apparently 'cuz they're fun on the fly.  They kinda remind me of saltwater fish( jacks or snapper )with that real silvery sheen and flat body.  And thanks for all the comments guys."
246590,KelfuN,2008-09-04 14:21:00,246,"the picture looks like you were at the York area. thats a great place to fish, but the current is strong as hell.  great smallie pic!"
246595,Mike Pike,2008-09-04 14:43:00,1332,"Nice to know I made a good choice.  Unlike the boat guys, us river rats have to go with one rod in hand and we ask it to do a lot of different things.  Kinda like making a golfer play with one club!  lol"
246598,tybrad,2008-09-04 14:50:00,45,"I'm gonna have to invest in some waders, the grand is right near me in k-w area, and shore hopping sucks... lol. good report!"
246617,Reef Runner,2008-09-04 15:48:00,980,A nice day off of work indeed Mike.  Thanks for sharing
