247092,SlowPoke,2008-09-06 02:20:00,2984,It's merely a guidline to help you with spool capacity. You could go 100yrds of 30lb braid (8lb mono dia.) if you wanted to. -Brian
247094,uglyfish,2008-09-06 02:23:00,981,"the higher the lb rating on the line the less the reel with hold. also the spools are sized according to the reel size and lb test they are spooled with, so casting distance is hindered when using a larger lb test line."
