245436,Mattones,2008-09-01 16:49:00,587,Yesterday I chipped in with some people to get a Charter boat here on lake O. This was my first time out of Lake O the water was pretty smooth as well.  Anyway I was the 3rd person to catch a fish so here is my 8.5 pounder. and the one at the very bottom was 13 or 14 pounds I can't really remember the size as someone decided to jump off the boat and cause us to head back 2.5 hours early. he was suspose to buy us all drinks but took off as soon as we hit shore. other then that I really enjoyed Salmon fishing they put up a sweet fight.      I thought this would make a nice photo and it did  
245462,Terry,2008-09-01 17:38:00,14456,way to go on your first  why did someone jump in the water
245472,bigugli,2008-09-01 17:52:00,6138,Must've been the strange liquid in the glasses on deck
245520,Leecher,2008-09-01 18:53:00,7832,Congratulation on your first salmon Mattones Thanks for sharing Leechman
245552,Guest Johnny Bass,2008-09-01 19:58:00,0,Congrats on your first Salmon! That sucks about that guy ruining it for everyone else! Thanks for sharing.
245565,Joey,2008-09-01 20:35:00,9122,"Congrats, looked like money well spent.  Nice boat and nice fish.  Too bad about the jumper!  Scratch him off your friend list.  Joey"
245723,Mattones,2008-09-02 02:26:00,587,The caption said its a law for Charter boats not to allow swimming. Plus mind you all the lures in the water. When he got on deck there was almost a fight because he wsted a good 2 hours of fishing left and one guy didnt have a turn.  For the 5 hours we were out there we caught i believe 8+ salmon.
245727,ccmtcanada,2008-09-02 02:28:00,7971,Great catch!!  Those salmon in open waters are pretty powerful fish!  Sucks about the swimmer though....not sure what he was thinking
245738,Jen,2008-09-02 02:44:00,833,Was the Beer cold in Andrews Keg ...maybe buddy had to many beer and got a little HOT ..
245762,Canuck,2008-09-02 04:14:00,491,Those look a lot like Rainbows to me.
245763,NAC,2008-09-02 04:35:00,369,Yup.....
245881,kemper,2008-09-02 17:20:00,2232,"They are, and fine ones too!"
245896,splashhopper,2008-09-02 18:03:00,2931," If that IDIOT were on any charter that i have been out on, he would have been spat on ! Too bad he ruined your first trip out.  Nice fish ya caught too."
245897,bukee,2008-09-02 18:11:00,58,"Those are great looking steelhead.  Been out a few times on Lake O in the last week, the steelhead action has been great in 300+ FOW.  The majority of those fish give a great acrobatic show.  Good job."
247099,Mattones,2008-09-06 03:38:00,587,I really want to head out again. ASAP before the season is over.
247102,Rich,2008-09-06 03:45:00,3927,"I'm glad someone else said it first.. definitely a rainbow, and a good one! Nice work!"
247104,Mattones,2008-09-06 04:00:00,587, Oh yah?hmm
247105,jwl,2008-09-06 04:02:00,1056, wow if your charter captain didn't know and tell you guys that those where rainbows
247106,Mattones,2008-09-06 04:09:00,587," I think he just let us all say they were Salmon so everyone was happy. haha. Though I do have a photo of what actually looks to be a Salmon that a friend caught as it does look like some ofthe  pictures i just googled.  But hey. Salmon, Chinhook or Rainbows.. I had a great time catching big fish as i have only been catching small carp all year. hehe  But my goal is go catch a pike or musky before the season ends."
247136,steverowbotham,2008-09-06 14:21:00,1800,Rainbows were my thought also
247142,johnnyb,2008-09-06 14:34:00,3413,And nice rainbows at that -- way to go!   I have to re-read the post though...missed the part about the swimmer...
247315,Canuck,2008-09-07 03:00:00,491,Those open water steelhead can be a lot of fun when they decide to play airplane.  The charter captains like to move to rainbows when they can't find the salmon or they get lock jaw.  I think they find the rainbows more predictable to find and catch ( I don't).  Its kind of funny that the captain told you guys they were salmon.  Maybe a bit distracted by the idiot Phelps wanna-be.
