246693,StrealHeader,2008-09-04 20:04:00,56,"I don't have a problem with the idea, my problem is the bills being made by Terry look like a cut and paste from a kindergarten class.  I would be insulted if I had my picture put on one.  Luckily I don't fish musky."
246696,pokerdemon4,2008-09-04 20:13:00,135,Luckily you can't catch one!!!!
246704,Terry,2008-09-04 20:35:00,14456,StrealHeader  drop dead
246707,Nemo,2008-09-04 20:45:00,727,StrealHeader the doors wide open you laid down the criticism. Let's see your work. Post it up for all to admire and critique. We are waiting....  And it better be good.
246715,bigugli,2008-09-04 21:11:00,6138,"I think the ""Bill"" looks great. It's not about the artwork anyway. It's about recognizing an achievement. Don't change a thing."
246733,Guest gbfisher,2008-09-04 22:13:00,0, Lucky for the board don't you mean?.....  Good luck with your HOOKUP!.....  hows that saying go? Put up or .........
246810,Ron,2008-09-05 02:07:00,1683,"Play nice boys!  I am also one of the proud ones to have attained my mug shot on the 50. Keep at it Terry, all but one is grateful for what you do for us."
246855,Smokey,2008-09-05 11:04:00,1278,Congrats on an awesome fish. She sure is a beauty. Thanks for posting it.  Terry keep the bills coming and ignore the jealous one  Mike
246856,Greencoachdog,2008-09-05 11:10:00,8163,"I'd be proud to have my Musky on one of those $50's!!!  ... if I ever catch one.   Hey Terry, maybe you could put Strealheader on a Loonie..."
246859,JFR,2008-09-05 11:37:00,498,"Very nice fish.  Close to 50"" no doubt."
246912,Cookslav,2008-09-05 14:14:00,1457,
246999,northamfishing,2008-09-05 18:50:00,10,"Just to clear up a few things, it's only water on my shirt and pants no blood. It was hooked on the side of the mouth, no injuries. I spent a good 10-15 mins reviving it and it gave a good splash on the release. I am about 5 foot 7"" 210lbs, maybe that will help."
247007,TroutnMuskieHunter,2008-09-05 19:18:00,1362,"Great lookin fish...congrats!!  Terry, keep printin' those 50's....  Hope to get one of those before the end of the 2008 season!!"
247089,cisco,2008-09-06 02:05:00,597,"Great fish! Congratulations.  Seriously though, I'd go 52 inches at 42lbs . I've only handled 35lbers and down, but that's my best opinion based on your height given.  And special congrats for getting it on one of your own creations!"
247156,lunkerbasshunter,2008-09-06 15:49:00,2585,"wow that is a big girl.  my guess is it would be about 40 pounds, super fish of a lifetie no matter the size!  Cheers!"
247172,limeyangler,2008-09-06 17:00:00,5204,ABSOLUTELY AWESOME
247253,cisco,2008-09-06 23:28:00,597,By the way.... replica taxidermists of notoriety should have molds of many musky which they use to produce one the size the angler claims. I suggest go to such a big taxidermist asap to view the molds. YOU are the best witness to the size of your trophy. Pick the mold that is closest or else you'll be unhappy over the years as you look at the wall mount and wish it was bigger... or smaller than the size you let we others order for you. My opinion anyhoo bud.  Take care and good fishin'!
246104,Pigeontroller,2008-09-03 02:40:00,2793,"Nice fish for sure! I'd say in the 50"" neighborhood, and a solid 35 pounds, maybe 40."
246108,bigfish1965,2008-09-03 02:52:00,3382,If I know your height I can figure out the fish fairly close. Also give me height to top of your shoulder
246113,scuro,2008-09-03 03:35:00,386,  That is a NICE fish and I don't see any blood on the fish. But NH's shirt and pants indicate a definite wound. Fish wound or NH wound?
246114,sharper,2008-09-03 03:37:00,279,Catch of a lifetime! Good Job!
246127,tonka-toy,2008-09-03 04:04:00,139,I lika dat juice!!!!You may just be able to sell some of those spinners after that post.Me first.
246141,Marc Thorpe,2008-09-03 10:33:00,621,"Nice monster Dude Congrats on the beast  One thing you might consider in future is taking a measurement of the length,this way you will know better the length instead of guess-estimate and possibly having a replica made that does not reflect upon the fish you caught Dont piddled around with the girth in the summer months because few fish have any girth worthy of measurement  But by all means thats a Gorilla,my best estimate is what Darsky said,then again I was not there so its a speculation  congrats man on the monster"
246201,blaque,2008-09-03 15:04:00,2419," Im thinkin thats just water on an orange shirt, making the orange look darker and more rederer"
246203,Raf,2008-09-03 15:06:00,3495,nice fish.
246207,kemper,2008-09-03 15:15:00,2232,"I think that fish HAS to be in the 50"" club. Ive seen fish much smaller looking go fifty and that fish is a BEAST."
246219,Guest gbfisher,2008-09-03 15:57:00,0,Gee more nice fish with back ground in them..  ..............................................................lol.....Its a nice one ...   Congratts!
246259,splashhopper,2008-09-03 18:00:00,2931," NICE FISH!  WhEN i don't have my tape measure I take a pic of the fish with my pole beside it or I hold the fish along side one of my own legs for the picture to get a measurment. I try to put the butt end of the pole at the tail end of the fish,,, then i can measure it later. I will also use my hands to get the girth. Not exact science, but better than nothing.  Hope this helps for next time."
246273,johnnyb,2008-09-03 19:06:00,3413,"yeah...that is a beast and a half...WOW!  I think the other estimates are looking pretty close, ie. 48-50"", 35-ish lbs.  For heaven's sake, send Rick your height...the man will give you a pretty darned accurate number on that fish! Again...way!  to!  go!!!!"
246276,jwl,2008-09-03 19:20:00,1056,wicked nice fish..gotta love it when you get muskies into the 50 incher ranges   spinner baits are awesome for muskies this time of year
246278,Terry,2008-09-03 19:28:00,14456,"looks like a good one to me           <a href=""http://s25.photobucket.com/albums/c52/Mrbeee1954/?action=view&current=50333.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://i25.photobucket.com/albums/c52/Mrbeee1954/50333.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photobucket""></a>"

246351,Dozer,2008-09-03 22:29:00,896,"Awesome pink bill there!  Wowzers, what a catch!"
246381,StrealHeader,2008-09-03 23:46:00,56,"Terry, please stop posting those 50"" bills. Your god awful photo editing is an insult to our currency."
246384,Terry,2008-09-04 00:05:00,14456,tough..live with it or leave
246386,steve_paul,2008-09-04 00:10:00,658, I am waiting for the day I get one of Terry's special 50's.
246567,Guest Johnny Bass,2008-09-04 13:29:00,0,WOW! Another GB Monster Musky!!!! And caught on a home made spinner bait! Gotta love it!! Great catch and thanks for sharing!
246632,Reef Runner,2008-09-04 16:12:00,980,"GBay is really producing some bigguns this year.  Congrats on a nice fish.  Love the $50's Terry, you da man.  Maybe its just the handle, but I thought Northamfishing did make lures?  I have some of their spinnerbaits bought at the Sportmen show"
246633,Handlebarz,2008-09-04 16:20:00,3790,"that sure looks nice and no matter what is said you have a bute there congratz on her she looks solid.  As for trying to have a fishing pole or some other measuring thing beside her that is a tuff one with a big fish I know I did not have the third hand for my 50 or any of the fish over 47"" that I have boated and would rather just get them back with out the measure heck it makes for better threads with letting the experts of the net guess"
246634,jwl,2008-09-04 16:23:00,1056," having too much of a hard time printing them off and cashing them in at the beerstore or something...or did the crack dealer come back on you for it??   I think it's pretty cool that Terry went through the trouble to do that up, and it's a pretty great achievement for anyone to boast catching a musky into the 50 incher plus range, I only ever caught 3 in those numbers, and that's alot of years trying..there are some pretty die-hard musky guys on here, and they will probably attest that for anyone who gets one that big it's a great accomplishment, and those 50's that Terry made up are well deserved as a show of respect opn the board to the person who caught the fish"
246641,bigugli,2008-09-04 16:42:00,6138,Yup. HE does make the lures. The lure he caught it on is part of the product line. I've got some of the red and whites for bigger pikies.
246655,gozwob,2008-09-04 17:41:00,34,Nice work Frank.......thats an awesome musky!!!  :clapping:
245993,northamfishing,2008-09-02 23:36:00,10,"This pig hammered my 1oz. hand made spinnerbait at around 7pm. I was burning the spinnerbait, when it hit. I set the hook and it cleared the water by about 3 feet. What a memory! After a few quick pictures back in she went to fight another day! This fish was caught on Georgian Bay. Unfortunately, I didn't have all the equipment to measure and weigh it. It's up to the imagination to how long and how much it weighed, girth etc... My buddy is a hardcore musky fishermen and he guessed about 50-55"" in length, maybe 55-60lbs.    "
245994,Rich Clemens,2008-09-02 23:38:00,3131,"Measured/Weighed or not, that's one huge musky in anyone's book.   Congrats on such a fine catch."
245995,tibbs,2008-09-02 23:39:00,650,Wow!  Nice fish!  Congrats on the PB!
246005,Roy,2008-09-02 23:49:00,13728,Nice fish for sure! Congrats!
246007,muskymatt,2008-09-02 23:50:00,2608,"Hmmm....47"" x 23"" ....27-28 lbs max   JMO  Nice fish though!!"
246010,Sebastian,2008-09-02 23:53:00,208,"Your friends weight & length estimates clearly show your friend fishes for the ""22lbs"" rainbows out east aka 14lbers. lol Its a good fish but nowhere near 50lbs lol High 40""s"
246011,Sandbag,2008-09-02 23:58:00,533,Awesome fish   congrats   Cheers  Craig
246015,richyb,2008-09-03 00:01:00,774,WOW  great muskie .. its easily double the size of my best !!!!!      I can only dream of getting one that size congrats on the fish .

246023,mikeh,2008-09-03 00:05:00,824,"awesome fish,must have put up a heck of a fight"
246026,northamfishing,2008-09-03 00:08:00,10,"Any more guesses on what weight, length and girth might be? I  would appreciate it,  as I am getting a replica made for my office. Thanks"

246090,Jigger,2008-09-03 01:49:00,1237,"just offhand I'd say its around 48-49in. My pb is less than that so I can only guess. Beauty catch, though. Congrats on the PB!"
