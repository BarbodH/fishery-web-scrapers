244505,Guest Johnny Bass,2008-08-29 13:55:00,0,Great Report! Congrats on your devirginization.
244533,BeRad3000,2008-08-29 15:12:00,65,"Congrats, nice ski!   Those look like some cool baits, i'll have to check em out."
245920,fishermccann,2008-09-02 19:39:00,655,"I would suggest that unless it it 36"" you have still not casught a REAL Muskie. You are still a virgin with a hand job!"
245921,fishermccann,2008-09-02 19:43:00,655,"I would like to suggest that until you have caught a  muskie of 36"" you are still a virgin with a hand job"
246519,Tarzan's Jane,2008-09-04 08:12:00,1183,It's never too late to say 'congrats'.  WTG
246540,b2kptbo,2008-09-04 11:42:00,1505,"WTG, thanks for the report..."
246547,jwl,2008-09-04 12:19:00,1056," I would say great fishin, some people fish a lifetime and never catch one..if it was to be a technicality like the 36 inches stated here, perhaps it should be the ""legal"" size from what ever body of water you are fishing, but then again there always has to be someone that says something crappy about almost every post on here  wait until you get into a 48-50 incher fish, you are up for a heck of a battle"
246640,maybe,2008-09-04 16:41:00,307,"Thanks for the shot in the arm.  Much appreciated, especially after the wet blanket.  Haven't made it back to the lake since this fish.  Itchy.  REALLY itchy!!!"
244215,maybe,2008-08-28 15:45:00,307,"We hit the lake around 5pm yesterday, and headed for a little cove we don't usually fish.  Jeff seemed excited about this ""new"" spot, but I wasn't feeling too optimistic.  A friend of mine passed away earlier this week, and I was having trouble getting excited about fish.  At any rate, since I figured nothing was happening anyway, I decided to throw out a bait I'd bought on a whim, but hadn't tried before.  Enter a PowerBait Realistix 5"" Power Jerkshad in pearl white.  They've got a subtle pinkish sheen to them, which caught my eye.    Threw one on a weighted 4/0 hook, and over the side it went.  Lots of little fish molested it, but nothing big enough to get at the hook.  What the heck - if it's a panfish day, it's a panfish day.  Grabbed a stinger hook, skinned it through the bait's tail, and threw it out again.  This little bugger immediately stepped up to the plate.  We couldn't believe it took a swipe at such a big dinner.    Umpteen little guys later, a bass showed up to remind us that the big hook actually worked.    Eventually, we moved off to drift a more familiar spot.  Jeff, as usual, was running up and down the boat to switch lures every 3 minutes.  Still in a lousy mood, and not really paying attention to the fishing, I kept absentmindedly throwing the jerkshad.  Every few minutes, I'd say hello to a little perch or bluegill.  Life as usual, until 7 o'clock rolled around.  I figured I'd hooked onto some really strong weeds, and sat still, waiting for them to give way.  Ha.  Next thing I know, my rod's bent in half, the drag is squawking, and I caught a brief glimpse of something big and greenish hitting the surface.  Sitting crosslegged on the motor as usual, I didn't have a great view, and couldn't see what it was.  Jeff must've had a better vantage point standing up on the bow seats, because the next thing I know he's yelling ""it's a muskie!""  Ohmigawd.  Nothing like pressure, now is there?  Fight lasted maybe 30 seconds, but it sure felt like longer.  I was sure I'd do something stupid, and the fish would get off before we could get a good look at it.  Sometimes, I really love it when I'm wrong.    30"", 5.5lbs...teeny by Lew standards, but huge in my little panfish world.    We did our best to keep handling & photo time to an absolute minimum.  Once it was safely in the net, Jeff looked after unhooking and handling the fish, while I snapped pics with one hand and laid out tools, ruler, and tourney team sign with the other.  Back in the water, the fish didn't hang around for much revival coddling.  Now that I've finally seen one of these critters, all I can say is:  I want to see more of them."

244277,JeffBornFishin,2008-08-28 19:08:00,260, She wont even handle a small fish you think she is gonna wrestle a ski?!  Girl is camera shy  Was a good short fight.  Lots of rolling and slashing.  Congrats again and FYI you have now caught every species in our five lakes.  Ya got me beat by one...catfish  Your Ski has put us into fourth place in the tourney!
244279,Joey,2008-08-28 19:11:00,9122,"Congratulations, a nice looking ski for sure.  Joey"
244294,ravinerat,2008-08-28 19:53:00,64,Congrats on the first Ski. Your hooked now . Can't wait for your second ski now.   RR
244299,fishnsled,2008-08-28 20:18:00,3520,Sorry for your loss Adrianne.  Sometimes it's best to get out and do something to get your mind off of things.  I think that muskie did that for you.    Congrats on the first of many I'm sure.
244317,Rich Clemens,2008-08-28 21:34:00,3131,Well now you've gone and done it ... you're hooked baby.    Many Congrats to ya.
244328,medmart,2008-08-28 22:28:00,587,WTG on your first ski  Rob
244387,maybe,2008-08-29 01:32:00,307,"Thanks for the encouragement, gang!  Roy - if I actually got in front of the camera, GCD would have nothing to rib me about.  Just can't have that, now can we?  J R - I expect I will find out before long.  Jeff caught his first a week and a half ago, with just his grandmother in the boat.  She's not digicam-friendly, so it escaped before he could get a pic of it.  I have this feeling he's got something to prove now.  The debit card's going to take a beating...  Carole - This is where I'm supposed to be a good girl and say that size doesn't matter, right?"
244388,Nanook,2008-08-29 01:43:00,565," Way to go Adrianne! That first Musky sure gets the heart pumping dont it. And the 2nd and the 3rd, and on and on.............................."

244467,ccmtcanada,2008-08-29 12:19:00,7971,Congrats!!!  It's always a bonus when you get into fish like that.  Sorry to hear about the loss of your friend....maybe that was his/her way of letting you know they are ok....by sending you this awesome fish.  Congrats again....hopefully the first of many for you!
