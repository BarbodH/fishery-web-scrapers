As i don't have the cash to get a salmon rod how could i try to fish for salmon using spinning tackle. What setup's could i use and what baits are suggested.  Thanks,  Mike"
247025,silvio,2008-09-05 20:39:00,433,I havenâ€™t fished with a spinning rod for salmon in years. The longer the rod the better. A medium action with 10 pound main line 5-8 pound fluorocarbon leader. Leaders can vary in length 12-24 + inches depending on water clarity. so this is the se up get some fixed float such as the clear redwing tackle one I use 4 gram float then put your split shot below the float from largest to smallest usually all u need is bb size and n1 size. Small micro swivel with your leader and then use salmon eggs or flies.

You ask question what gear to use, then people will tell you to use this or that, then you have to spent $$.  If you are consider to get proper gears, you are looking at some where between $100 to infinitly.  As for bait, you can use fly, spawn, yarn......  there are all kinds of bait to use, but then you need the proper gear to fish for.....  Let's say you have a 6' - 7' spinning rod and a mid size spinning reel , then you need to use around 10 to 12 lb test line, size 6 - 10 octopus hook or egg hook, bottom rig or float rig and do some drifting and see what happen, there is alway a chance you can hook one.  light line do work better but then you need to use loner rod."
247140,Rich,2008-09-06 14:28:00,3927,For salmon I just use a 7 foot medium action spinning rod and 8lb test. I don't bust out the float gear until the steel moves up.
