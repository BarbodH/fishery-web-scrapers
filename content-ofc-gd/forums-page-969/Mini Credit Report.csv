246605,Reef Runner,2008-09-04 15:16:00,980,"Hit the Credit River after work yesterday in search of some Salmon.  Tried spoons and then drifted bags for a while.  No hits, but witnessed some aerial acrobatics right over my line which had me stickin around for another hour.  The Salmon are runnin', but I suspect the water is a little warm for them to entering the river en masse.  I left my card and told em' I'll be back.  Anybody else having luck on the tribs thus far?  reefrunner"
246616,timmeh,2008-09-04 15:44:00,609,"I spent a few hours yesterday throwing spoons in some huron tribs, saugeen and sauble, as I was in that area. I didn't get any action fishing at the mouth of either river and also didn't see any signs of fish. I was told by locals a fish was caught over the weekend but the run hadn't started yet, and it's still a week or 2 early."
246629,lucabrasi,2008-09-04 16:08:00,114,"I was on the credit on tues aft. saw one, drifted a pink worm then a fly, but no bite. I gave up after about 20 mins. I didn't see any other, drifted a few pools and got nothing other than a couple of creek chub. nobody else got anything either."
246664,johnnyb,2008-09-04 18:20:00,3413,My cousin who lives in Port Credit says the river is starting to smell pretty fishy...they gotta be in there...where's all this rain we've been complaining about NOW?
246703,chickenhawk,2008-09-04 20:34:00,612,fish are definately in the rivers.....just gotta know which ones.....im planning on going tomorrow...
246775,Mattones,2008-09-05 00:20:00,587,On Sunday night at likw 3am I was walking my buddy back to the jeep from the bar SPICE just down the road and saw someone from work gutting a fish saying he caught close to a 30 pounder just along the river.
246819,Guest Fishing For Life,2008-09-05 02:59:00,0,I have been catching them in eastern tribs centerpining usual baits  What I have noticed is that you have to keep trying until you find a pool with fish It seems they all gather at one pool only .. not scatter around  Guys downstream and upstream from where I was didnt catch a thing until they decided to join me .. didnt take too long for them to get some hooksup  Maybe I was just lucky
246874,Reef Runner,2008-09-05 13:00:00,980,"You make a compelling case Fish for Life.  With the rain they're calling for, it should be a better experience out there this weekend.  Goodluck all."
246886,BillM,2008-09-05 13:17:00,17367,"Hey Reef, if you need someone to net the monsters you'll sure to be pulling in, let me know   I'd love to wet some lines after work next week!"
246889,Reef Runner,2008-09-05 13:21:00,980,"Cool, will keep that in mind Bill.  You ever end up trying your luck yet?  Talking with other anglers, things are kinda slow right now.  It should heat up in the next week or two."
246897,BillM,2008-09-05 13:47:00,17367,"Not with this hot weather, I've been chasing brookies and small bows the past few weekends..."
