205521,icefisherman,2008-05-24 00:51:00,952,"Started at 5:30 with my son and Brian. He finally managed to get the skunk off his back today with a nice 21+ Lbs-er. And he helped on almost as big (20Lbs-er on one of my rods)... I got 2 more (17 Lbs and 6 Lbs) and a nice laker. There were two double headers so overall great day. We've had to work hard to find the fish...once found the bite was on while above them... Tech data: 130 - 175 fow, spoons and flies with something green on them....5 for 6 for the day....not bad! Few pictures of very happy fishermen   :  Brian's record for the day:   My laker as a double header with his from above:   My 6 Lbs-er:   The one Brian helped me with on my rod during the second double header:   Now here is the double header ....it was so hard to keep both fish long enough for the picture....about 38 Lbs combined weight:   Cheers, Ice Fisherman"

205955,Reel Nauti Pirate,2008-05-25 12:51:00,52,What speeds were you trolling and was there a thermocline visible on your sonar??
205975,SlowPoke,2008-05-25 14:12:00,2984,2-3mph depending on direction... seemed to me like a heavy downcurrent. No t-cline on the graph and I've read other reports stating temps were uniform top to bottom. No downspeed or temp unit on board. -Brian
