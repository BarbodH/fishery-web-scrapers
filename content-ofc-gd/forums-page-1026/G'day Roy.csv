205913,Roy,2008-05-25 09:11:00,13728,"Morning Lew! Was great, thanks for asking. I can't believe how quiet those things are. I must say, I was a little leary about the size of the monster on my boat but, it IS within the plate specs. Will take that J woman out today."
205915,lew,2008-05-25 09:16:00,12767,"Good to hear Roy, and your really gonna appreciate it after a full day of trolling.  Best of luck with it."
205916,Spiel,2008-05-25 09:26:00,9065," I know you're not going to regret it Roy, it's a ting o beauty!"
205974,TJQ,2008-05-25 14:09:00,7806, I don't think J is going to like it at all... she'll be able to hear you all day long now!!!  
205979,tjsa,2008-05-25 14:18:00,1578,"Ohhhhh...........Buuurrrnnnn................................  On another note, I finally saw one of those motors up close yesterday on a Tracker, it was a 225 or 230 I think, its absolutely nuts how physically big they are.  But, I don't own a boat that could handle them anyways, and likely never will."
205981,jwl,2008-05-25 14:27:00,1056," key is you gotta do that once in a while...then if you bug the women enough they ""make"" you get out of thier hair and go fishin  or they don't bug you so much about going out in the boat  .  I was curious about the 4 stroke thing too for my smaller boat....currently I run an old 2 stroke 9.9 on it..the boat is rated for a 15 but evenm some of the new 9.9 models look like they would be too big and heavy for the boat, let alone putting a 15 on it, I asked at the dealership where my 2 boats came from and they said it would be ok as specs are rated for a 4 stroke and the weight capacity..however I am still a bit sceptical about that because the boat itself is only about 240lbs or so"
205983,TJQ,2008-05-25 14:34:00,7806,Just put the old lady in the front of the boat... it will even it out....
