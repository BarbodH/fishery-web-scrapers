197357,dsn,2008-05-06 10:49:00,1018, Yeah if it's Sunday...I won't be able to make it too. Church.  If it was the Island...  I would be willing to prep the entire streach of the main area of the island  (from the Grandstand towards Halans Point ) which would help to keep the fish there til the actual GTG.  But I would need a massive load of maize to do it with. Cause I will need to do it a few days at least before the GTG. But I have no maize. Might need some help too. I have a new sling now.    DSN
197408,Toronto_Angler,2008-05-06 13:01:00,698,The island sounds like a pretty good idea as it isn't that crowded and even has lots of room for BBQ's and such.
197528,Victor,2008-05-06 18:30:00,1609,just a bump after the update...  btw dsn if transportation is the problem as wolfville said it can most likely be arranged ...
197543,Golfisher,2008-05-06 19:10:00,586,"I might be able to make it, depending on the date and the time."
197544,capt bruce,2008-05-06 19:11:00,820,"Ashbridges is good too , lots of room if we fish the bay NOT the board walk , on the west side by the bridge to the sewage plant ,we can set up maybe 10-20 guys and have a day of it . with dsn baiting the week before should have lots of fish , have had many 10-20 fish days with lots of +20 pound fish and no one fishes there, no one  (except one old asian guy,I see most nights ,probably the best carp guy I have ever met , very low tech but he knows his prey ) we can do a west at the credit and than a east a few weeks later ????"
197586,glirw,2008-05-06 20:01:00,200,Depending on time and date I am very in.
198000,wolfville,2008-05-07 16:16:00,396,"  Never fished that side, do you park the car in the park and WALK all the way over?  I like the idea of having another one a few weeks later... summer is only that long, can't waste any of it."
198017,Victor,2008-05-07 16:29:00,1609, Agreed.  Sounds good capt bruce ... looks like a great swim from google map. In fact I work a few minutes away so i might have to try it one of these evenings. Thanks for sharing it with us.
198221,bassjnkie,2008-05-07 22:56:00,1101,"Victor, hope this work out for you, may be we can come out next time. Have plans to go to Hammie. Let me know how it goes.  Daniel"
198380,sharper,2008-05-08 02:31:00,279,Count me in if time permits.
204809,jdmls,2008-05-22 15:32:00,575,Hey Victor . is this still a go for Saturday ???
204815,wolfville,2008-05-22 15:36:00,396,"Too bad I can't make it this Saturday either, have plans for family already. Might swing by on my way to Niagara Falls if time is right.  Hope everyone having a good time, by the looks of the weather, you guys will have a blast !"
204822,Victor,2008-05-22 15:54:00,1609,Yup it sure is! I'll be there at around 6ish. For those who showed interest you will receive a PM from me sometime today.  Bring on the warmer temps!
204824,CLofchik,2008-05-22 16:01:00,854,"Looks to be a decent day, I might come out and play for the hook & corn team  Do you guys fish upstream of the bridge or downstream?"
204837,Toronto_Angler,2008-05-22 16:14:00,698,crap saturday is a no go for me. If anyone wants to go on Sunday I would probably be able to make it.
205008,MJL,2008-05-22 22:25:00,2427,I should be good for Saturday.
205015,Andrew,2008-05-22 22:35:00,54,Saturday sounds good for me.  Weather looks great!
205311,glirw,2008-05-23 14:11:00,200,Good luck to all.
205556,nautifish,2008-05-24 01:52:00,1416,You had to pick a day when i have to work.  But have fun all.
196759,Victor,2008-05-05 14:18:00,1609,"U P D A T E D     M A Y 22  Date: Saturday May 24 Location: Port Credit Time: AM till whenever  Please post or send me a PM if you're interested. For those who already replied, you will receive a PM from me sometime today."
196763,Toronto_Angler,2008-05-05 14:23:00,698,I'd be interested in this. As long as it's not the weekend of the walleye opener. Whate would be the times for this? Port Credit seems like a good location.
196766,Anton Kanagasuntheri,2008-05-05 14:28:00,160,"Yea I am in, the long weekend won't work out for me"
196838,wolfville,2008-05-05 17:30:00,396,"Saturday would work for me, will probably show up with two boys.  Thanks for organizing this.  BBQ may be a problem ... who's going to man the BBQ when we're all hauling ;-)  BTW, Port Credit swim gets pretty crowed by carpers during the weekends in May, if more than 10 show up we might have to practice accurate casting for a few days before going there LOL"
196859,Victor,2008-05-05 18:16:00,1609," BBQ? i have already taken that into account, i know that your two boys will be coming ... and when they say ""daddy we're hungry"" ... i don't think you have much of a choice.  I noticed it gets crowded at P.C. last time we were there ... maybe some of us will have to set up our Pods at the rockpiles lol. Skyway at Hamilton is good but we'll have to see if everyone's willing to travel that way ... let me know guys and girls!"
196868,Marko,2008-05-05 18:23:00,854,"This comming saturday pike opens here so i am going to spend the day pike fishing. Sunday i could come. Next weekend i am free i think, and the long weekend after that i am off to Ottawa so no good then. I have a little portable charcoal bbq that can be used if you guys want to bbq."
196875,Toronto_Angler,2008-05-05 18:30:00,698,Hamilton is a little far for me as I live in Scarborough.
196885,Anton Kanagasuntheri,2008-05-05 18:42:00,160,  same here
196897,Marko,2008-05-05 18:59:00,854,"You guys say it might be packed, since a lot of people fish carp there. Do carp move in large numbers or you`ll see couple caught every day. Never fished there so i have no idea what to expect."
196913,Victor,2008-05-05 19:19:00,1609,"Although we say it might be ""crowded"" ... that swim does have quite a bit of room, it's just that with the long rods anglers might need alittle more room to place their bait/rig.  There should be numbers in that area ... whether they choose to bite or not i won't know lol. The fish in my avatar is caught there. It seems that May 17th will be a good day for everyone ..."
196935,dsn,2008-05-05 19:57:00,1018,Sorry I don't think I'll be able to make it. Out or my league. Also out of my area of reach.    DSN
196940,wolfville,2008-05-05 20:07:00,396,"DSN, if your problem is transportation, I am sure it can be arranged.  But for picking a Sunday.... I might have to pass on this. Church in the morning and kid's skating class in the afternoon..... Will pray for you guys at least."
196947,sharper,2008-05-05 20:26:00,279,"Was at Hamilton today and we caught a bunch, including a monster! Long weekend not good for me since I'll be Algonquin. Port Credit sounds like a good idea."
196958,Anton Kanagasuntheri,2008-05-05 20:45:00,160,can't do it on the long weekend!! going to Ottawa
196992,Photoz,2008-05-05 21:42:00,792,
196996,MJL,2008-05-05 21:47:00,2427," No need for a BBQ, the smell of my bait will put everyone's appetite off"
197001,ccmtcanada,2008-05-05 21:55:00,7971,You mean fish for carp during the day?  Never tried that before...are you sure you can catch them then??? LOL.  Weekends are tough for us....especially that far away....good luck out there guys!
197003,Marko,2008-05-05 22:02:00,854,whatever happened to hook and sinker and some corn haha. Its funny how times have changed.
197004,MJL,2008-05-05 22:03:00,2427, Rumor has it you're a vampire cliff...Sucking the life forces from fish before setting them free to catch again at a later date.  I imagine the mouth of the rouge has enough space.  Haven't hauled a carp out of there in years though.
197017,Andrew,2008-05-05 22:13:00,54,"I'd be willing to make the trek for it.  Carping is something I definitely want to learn more about.  So long as I get some directions, I should be able to make it!  Andrew."
197024,FishKing,2008-05-05 22:23:00,5,I'd be definitely interested for sure as I am a newbie at carp fishing aside from the basic knowledge of the hair rig and boilies!
197101,Mattones,2008-05-06 00:02:00,587,I'll be down for this. I'm from Burlington and can drive and can help with a car pool if need be.  Never tried carp fishing. Always good trying something new.
197129,Crazyhook,2008-05-06 00:24:00,1154,"I will be in TO at the end of the month for a wedding, could swing by early for a fish before"
197138,lazybum,2008-05-06 00:28:00,142,Rouge has been redone (beautified) quite a bit but the number of parking spaces have been reduced a lot.  Also not much space along the river/bay to cast.  Not sure how much carp are still in there as well. The water level now may not be as high as the picture shows from a month ago.  
197262,sharper,2008-05-06 02:09:00,279,WOW the rouge is very nice now. I was just there a few weeks ago at night didn't see that. Maybe it was dark and fenced off.
