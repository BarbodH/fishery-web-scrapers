205221,scuro,2008-05-23 04:13:00,386,"Thanks for those who posted your funny pics. Here are some in return   This fish was lassoed through the gills...the hook is with the seaweed.   This little guy really wanted this fish.   This is what occasionally happens when you try to take your own fish picture.   Slippery when wet.   His filleting skills need honing.   It sure is bugy out there.   Man, this dude really wants a fish dinner...NOW!   Never bring your rods that still have lures on them into the cabin. Your wife won't like that at all!   After being teased, this dude does a mock demonstration on why bringing pads out to the bush is a good idea. ""The ability of those things to simply absorb blood is AMAZING""!"
