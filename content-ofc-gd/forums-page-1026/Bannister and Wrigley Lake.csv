205431,fatherof3,2008-05-23 20:01:00,1769,Bannister used to be really good for Pike.Still some smaller ones in there.Lots of panfish/catfish
205435,Musky or Specks,2008-05-23 20:05:00,2710,"Bannister and Wrigley both have crappie, pike and largemouth. Bannister has a law stated absolutely no watercraft. Use to do a lot of catfish fishing on Wrigely as a kid. Both lakes are extemely shallow and full of weeds which leads to heavy winter kill every year. What do you like to fish for dude PM me and Ill give you some area hotspots to try. I live in the Rockway gardens section of town and have lived most of my here. And most of that Ive spent fishing."
