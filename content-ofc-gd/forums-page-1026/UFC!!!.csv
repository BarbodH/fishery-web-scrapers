205847,Gerritt,2008-05-25 01:02:00,6129,Here is my take..  BJ Penn Vs. Sean Sherk                   Penn Wanderlei Silva Vs. Keith Jardine      Jardine Wilson Gouveia Vs. Goran Reljic       Gouveia Tito Ortiz Vs. Lyoto Machida             Machida Thiago Silva Vs. Antonio Mendes      Silva   and yours?  G
205857,glirw,2008-05-25 01:25:00,200,"BJ Penn Vs. Sean Sherk  - Can go either way. If Sherk is dominant than he will just control the fight and win a decision. Otherwise, Penn by Submission.  Wanderlei Silva Vs. Keith Jardine - Silva is desperate and needs a win. He is going to catch Jardine with a good right hook and will send him home.  Wilson Gouveia Vs. Goran Reljic - Gouveia Tito Ortiz Vs. Lyoto Machida - If Machida can avoid the takedowns he will win.  Thiago Silva Vs. Antonio Mendes - Silva"
205862,Gerritt,2008-05-25 01:33:00,6129,But Sherk has been off for 10 months.. due to 'Roids?  Jardine is a machine!!  Tito is a chump  LOL
