205801,buckster,2008-05-24 22:29:00,530,"Well thanks to Sinker and Big Chev, me and Meely decided to hit Simcoe this morning to try our luck at some Whiteys. We arrived at the launch at 7 am. Our directions were to ""look for the boats"".....So we looked for them, found them and anchored in 65 FOW. Wind was out of the NW at 15 km/h.....water temp 49 degrees. Dropped our lures in at 7:45 am.........8:30....we had our limits.  The action was non-stop. Wow.....what a day !! Again, we have never really targeted whities during soft water season and it is thanks to Sinker and Big Chev who offered some great advice which paid off LARGE. A BIG Thanks !!  Buckster The guests of honour "
