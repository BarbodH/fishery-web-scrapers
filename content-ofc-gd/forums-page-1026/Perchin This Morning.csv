204952,fishing n autograph,2008-05-22 20:11:00,2540,Well...I got sick of being skunked so I went out for some perch this morning....  Headed out to Port Dover....and it was cold and wet.....  After about an hour of not catching anything the nicest lady i've ever met came over and asked me how i was fishin for perch. I showed her my set up and she told me that what I was doing will never catch fish. So she gave me a pickeral rig and BANG.....15 jumbo perch for the dinner table.  This was the first time i'd ever got perch fishing and every fish was a keeper!  Yum...i'll share pics later!  Dave

205572,Rich,2008-05-24 02:30:00,3927,"After you mentioned the pickerel rig, I was sure who that nice lady was.  There are more ways to get them down there than a pickerel rig though."
