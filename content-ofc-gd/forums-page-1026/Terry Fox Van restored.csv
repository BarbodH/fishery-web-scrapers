205434,danbo,2008-05-23 20:03:00,2646,"My brother-in-law Robert, did the work!"
205436,misfish,2008-05-23 20:10:00,29133, Kudos to him.
205453,lew,2008-05-23 21:14:00,12767,"The term hero gets thrown around pretty loosely these days and it's given to everybody from hockey players to movie actors for some strange reason, but to me there's nobody who deserves the classifcation more than Terry Fox......he stands for what the word REALLY means.  When he came thru Toronto so many years ago we all went to see him as he ran by only a couple blocks from my home and when he died I remember it like it was this morning. A group of us were standing on the front lawn of my trailer shooting the breeze and it came over the radio and you could practically hear a pin drop as everybody just kinda stood in silence.  Canada and all Canadians lost someone VERY special when Terry Fox died."
205456,danbo,2008-05-23 21:19:00,2646,"AMEN , Lew"
205457,ccmtcanada,2008-05-23 21:21:00,7971,We went to see him as he came through Ajax...  What a great event for us school kids!!
205462,misfish,2008-05-23 21:42:00,29133,"Lew you just said what I was thinking,but didnt take the time to post it. Thank you.  A true HERO."
205465,Sandbag,2008-05-23 21:45:00,533,"Well said Lew...  A true Canadian and a true hero.  Always think of him when I hear that song ""He ain't heavy, he's my brother""  Cheers  Craig"
205472,Spiel,2008-05-23 21:58:00,9065, ....Those are two sentiments I could not possibly agree more with!
205498,tbayboy,2008-05-23 23:21:00,1497,Very vivid memory - being from Thunder Bay we were planning to go wait for him to come by when we got the news that he'd stoppped just before the city.  We all hoped it was just a temporary pause but we all know now it wasn't
205564,danc,2008-05-24 02:14:00,4677, Terribly sad that he stopped his journey near our home town. But luckily for us that we have this incredible monument to honor his legacy here now.  
205569,danbo,2008-05-24 02:21:00,2646,"Great shot, Dan"
205585,Tinman,2008-05-24 03:10:00,376,"i remember seeing him run through ottawa, with an opp car not far from him"
205593,kickingfrog,2008-05-24 03:25:00,8333,Terry Fox runs in countries across the world every September. Millions of Dollars raised each year. All the other awareness/fund-raising treks inspired (Rick Hanson's Man in Motion) All before he was 23 years old.   Legacy.
205639,Baptiste,2008-05-24 11:50:00,37,"My 8 year old son has a HUGE Terry Fox poster on his wall; books and memorabilia. No rock stars, no athletes. He's a normal well adjusted kid...and Terry Fox is his hero."
