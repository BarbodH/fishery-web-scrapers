I took a couple of the students for a sneeky 1/2 fish on the rocks and we did pretty well, fish for supper tonight. We were just throwing out twisty tail grubs and live minnows on jigs, there's a big current here so you can just let the bait drift down and the current lifts and makes the bait swim just by lifting the rod tip, dont have to really even reel in...and bam! good fun.   ALL IN A DAY'S WORK     ITS NOT FOR MY BENEFIT>>>I DO IT FOR MY STUDENTS!!      SUPPER!  "
