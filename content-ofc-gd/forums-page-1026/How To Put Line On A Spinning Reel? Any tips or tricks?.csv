205466,Garry2Rs,2008-05-23 21:50:00,1425,"It doesn't matter what type of line you are using, monofilament, Fluorocarbon, braid etc.  To put line on a spinning reel, you hold the spool facing the spinning reel, so the line comes off the bulk spool in the direction opposite the way the bail turns.  What I am saying is, as the bail turns, it should take the line off of the bulk spool and wind it onto the reel spool.  This will minimize line twist."

205485,Sinker,2008-05-23 23:02:00,8692,"Most spools of line are made so you put the spool of line on the floor with the label facing up, then just reel it on with some tension on the line. Don't over fill it. Leave about 1/8 "" from the edge of your reel spool.  Sinker"

205560,Dave Frasso,2008-05-24 02:01:00,20,"After loading on new fishing line.... on any reel...  Hold it under the hot water tap for a few minutes... It will help to take the memory out of line that came off the big spool, now it's on a smaller spool.  Works for me..   Dave"
205563,danc,2008-05-24 02:09:00,4677,"Every spool that I've bought in the past several years has a notch in it so that if it's not facing the right way, it will flip itself over so that it is. It makes thing really simple. Just tie it on your spool and reel away until full."
205677,douG,2008-05-24 15:21:00,2693,"Attach your new line to the empty spool with an arbor knot, wind a few turns, then apply a turn or two of electrician's tape or duct tape over this line against the spool.  This will stop your line, even braid, from slipping on the retrieve."
205678,wallyboss,2008-05-24 15:24:00,1095,Mono will not slip. No need to put tape.  Braid the tape will help.
