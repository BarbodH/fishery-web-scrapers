205683,misfish,2008-05-24 15:43:00,29133,"Boy I was starting to think the boys were all done with getting thier thang on with the ladies,since I had not heard or seen a single bird for two weeks. Being my last chance this weekend to get my second bird (which would go to the land owner) I was up at 4am and on my way. Man can you believe light starts s=just before 5am. I get to my spot and get my blind all set up and get snuggled in and finish my java. As you can see I still had a bit of time before the fly downs started.   Just before the sun started to make it,s rise I was approuched by the night bandit. Pic didnt turn out,but I said good morning little fella and said be on yer way.A quick clap and off he scurried.LOL It,s time now to start the fly down cackle and the fluffing of the piece of fabric I have. The fabric when snapped open and closed,make the sound of a bird flying down from his/her rest. I do this for the first half hour with the odd yelp and cackle with a few clucks in between. I have no response at all to this. An hour or so goes by,I start yelpping loud and clucking,and still nothing.Wow,not a call back from anything.  A couple of shots from the blind and what it looks like from a turkey hunter view.     Then in a far distance I hear the gobble . It sounds like it,s coming from the back of the property. I decide to make the direct move to where I might beable to call the bird out.  Just as I get around the edge of the ceders ,I see this bird making his way back  to the bush from the plowed corn field. It was hard to see if it was a male or hen,but the way it was struting,I had a feeling it was a tom. I quickly stop and give A friendly yelp and cluck.The bird stops. Turns and gobbles. I have his attention.The bad part was I was standing right in his view. I keep completely still and just yelp and cluck,as he makes his way towards me. Just as his view is ubstucked, I drop and lay on the wet dew grass.  . Good move,but bad for the slate call.It gets wet and now I am without a call. The bird still makes his way gobbling. I am drying and wiping off the slate and trying to get it dry. Finally I was able to get the darn thing to work,barely. By this time the bird is wondering what happen to the lonely hen. It makes it way back towards the bush. All of a sudden I become a slithering hunter trying to work my way to some cover so I can get a clear,clean shot of the bird. The bird catch,s my movement,and forsome reason make the dission to turn and come around me.Mistake,it was to my advantage. I wait for him to walk out from behind a brush pile and he offers up a clean shot.It was another jake,which was just fine by me. My second bird this season and thats the end of another spring turkey season for me.    On my walk back to the truck I came accross this pile of fur and a scull that was in 2 pieces.I believe it was a night bandit that met his match.      Thanks for reading."

205947,Fish Farmer,2008-05-25 12:24:00,2234,"Congrats Brian, I may give the fall hunt a try. No time in the spring because of fishing.  OFAH FILE: 842 May 22, 2008 For Immediate Release  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- --------- Provincial fall wild turkey regulations now in force O.F.A.H. welcomes hunt, advises hunters to review regulations before fall season ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ---------  As promised by the Ministry of Natural Resources (M.N.R.), there will be a fall wild turkey season in designated parts of Ontario this year. Changes to regulations pertaining to wild turkey in the Open Seasons-Wildlife section under the Fish and Wildlife Conservation Act, 1997, were finalized on May 15 and are now in force. The move had been expected, as the fall hunt was proposed in the Wild Turkey Management Plan, which was posted on the Environmental Bill of Rights (E.B.R.) for public comment in February .  ""The Ontario Federation of Anglers and Hunters (O.F.A.H.) is pleased that the fall wild turkey season will proceed as promised in parts of Ontario,"" said O.F.A.H. Executive Director Mike Reader. ""The wild turkey is thriving, and expanded hunting opportunities provide for sound wildlife management, time in the outdoors for hunters, and economic benefits for many communities that derive their livelihood from the outdoor industry.""  A fall wild turkey hunting season has been approved in Wildlife Management Units 64, 67, 68, 73, 76, 77, 78, 81, 82, 84, 89, 90, 92, and 93. The season will run each year from the Tuesday following Thanksgiving until the second Sunday following Thanksgiving.  Regulations for the fall season vary slightly from the spring, so the O.F.A.H. is strongly encouraging hunters to thoroughly review the regulations before the season opens. Whereas in the spring hunters may purchase two licences and harvest a season total of two birds over two or more days, the fall limit is one bird per hunter, per season. Unlike the spring season, fall harvested wild turkeys may be of either gender, with or without a beard.  Wild Turkey Facts:  * The O.F.A.H. initiated the highly successful program to bring back the extirpated eastern wild turkey to Ontario more than twenty years ago.  * There has been a hunting season since 1987, and during that time, wild turkey populations have continually increased. Moderate estimates place Ontario's turkey population at well over 70,000 birds.  * The wild turkey is a popular game bird, even though hunters require special training and certification to obtain the turkey designation on their hunting licence.  * Since 1987, the O.F.A.H. has trained 78,300 turkey hunters in seminars held across Ontario.  * Last year, wild turkey licence sales contributed $936,789 to the M.N.R. Special Purpose Account.   With 83,000 members and 655 member clubs, the Ontario Federation of Anglers and Hunters is the leading fish and wildlife conservation organization in Ontario."
