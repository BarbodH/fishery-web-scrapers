203577,jace,2008-05-20 04:59:00,472,might be able to do screenshots of Garmin bluechart if you know what area you want.
203582,bassboyzzz,2008-05-20 06:03:00,7,I need the area between Gilchrist Bay and Crowes Landing.Thanks j ace.
203584,bassboyzzz,2008-05-20 06:04:00,7,info is in my personal
203592,jace,2008-05-20 07:57:00,472,  checked it out.  At full detail it's going to have to be 3 screenshots because the bay is too far south to get it all in 1.  ..unless you just want an overview from chart with general info and some details missing like rock dangers and some contour lines
203924,bassboyzzz,2008-05-20 20:36:00,7,Overview is fine.Thanks
204197,jace,2008-05-21 07:43:00,472,"  will try to do it tomorrow afternoon before work if i get up ""early""."
205611,jace,2008-05-24 04:31:00,472,...sent to that taurus email.  let me know if you need the view moved around or whatever.
205651,Zamboni,2008-05-24 12:47:00,235,Sent you links to all charts I have scanned bassboyzz. Stony was first chart scanned so not quite as good-learned later to leave overlap so pages making up larger lakes are easier to peice together.
