This is when my wife and I sold our permanent position. Day two was always the determining day... Last year I replaced my buddy in a team and fished the one day... I'm thinking of applying for next years . The reason for the change is that there are barley any new volunteers and the ones that are there are getting up in age... cooking 2 breakfasts and throwing 2 huge parties for 450 anglers + guests gets to be hard so we were told.. It was also hard for the out of town Anglers..Friday night meeting must attend.. Saturday 8-3 ..then the party and dance..Sunday 7:30 - 2:30... then the banquet and a long drive home for some.  There are 225 teams fishing it this year... I will get news from my buddies this evening and will keep you posted.  In 1999 my wife and I were #1 on day 1 by 20"" on day two we finished in 95th place.  In 2001 we were 35th on day 1 behind by 18"" and ended up 6th place in the end.  Randy."
