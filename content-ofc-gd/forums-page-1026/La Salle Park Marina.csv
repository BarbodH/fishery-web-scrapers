If anyone could give me any help on where to go and what to look for that would be greatly appreciated, even the type of lures i should use.  thanks in advance"
205361,uglyfish,2008-05-23 16:50:00,981,"just cast off the wall there, or i can walk around and go up the break wall and fish along there too. u can get bass, pike, perch, rock bass, white perch, catfish, carp, sheepshead. live bait rigs are good, or the usually bass and pike lures. keeping in mind bass is out of season till june 28th."
