205518,camillj,2008-05-24 00:33:00,1988,Another great opener at the ZEC ... here's a few pics to share with you all ...   We have a new (private) road in to the lake which runs right along side this creek which runs almost 400 feet down the mountain from our lake ...      The weather was beautiful and we even managed a few fish ...   And a little team 4 logo (Joeys Man Ho's) ... inches    The new waterproof camera case came in handy ... and I have a few cool underwater shots from opening day I'll post later ...   Here's my navigator doing the four colour troll ... with a magog smelt  
205530,glen,2008-05-24 01:07:00,2641,I like the look of that area.  Catching a fish is a bonus.  What are you trolling for in the last pic?  The rod and reel look a little heavy for specs.
205565,Lostchild,2008-05-24 02:14:00,153,"Nice report and pictures!  I don't think that entry will be allowed in the tournament though, isn't ZEC in the province of Quebec?"
205605,camillj,2008-05-24 04:08:00,1988,"Thanks,  yes the ZEC is near St Gabriel in Quebec, which as far as I know is very much within the rules of our tourney.  Glen ... you'd be surprised how much fun it is to catch a Spec down 9 coulours on 12lb lead line with a 6lb leader ... its actually the only way way to catch fish after the water warms up.  Most of our fish this weekend were caught on the fly (you'll notice the fly rod on the bench beside him) ... but mostly early morning and at dusk ... the risers were everywhere ..."
205607,limeyangler,2008-05-24 04:18:00,5204,"nice pics, scenery is good too. I was also thinking that downrigger looks big for specs....but what the heck do i know....lol....i've never caught one before!"
205609,Joey,2008-05-24 04:21:00,9122,"Way to go  Awesome pics, I can't wait to see the underwater ones.  I've added your tourney entry to our team  Joey"
205613,camillj,2008-05-24 04:36:00,1988,Here are a couple of the underwater pic's (taken in April at a nearby Lake O trib) so they dont count for the tourney ... and besides ... its hard to get the team logo to show up under water    
205687,Moosebunk,2008-05-24 15:56:00,3970,Great shot CamJ.  Friends of mine were up in Zec Dumoine last week at an old stomping ground of ours.  Love the specks and the area in general.
