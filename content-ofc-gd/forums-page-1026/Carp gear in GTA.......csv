I've checked BPS and they only seem to have pre-made Berekley carp bait and I recalling someone mentioning that Angling Specialists on Hwy. 7 / Jane carries a wide range of gear..  Help me out guys!"

205622,Photoz,2008-05-24 08:40:00,792,"There's a small place on Sheppard Avenue West, on the north side, about a half kilometer EAST of the Allan Expressway that appears to have a lot of odds & ends for fishing carp. I made a brief visit in there looking for some Nash hooks last month . . . .    I got a package that LOOKED exactly like Nash . . .    the first one I used bent, the next 2 broke . . . .    but . . . . . .     for $2.00 . . . .    what can ya expect? Other than this, Fishing World in Hamilton, and I think a second place in Hamilton is now in business (Alberts?) that I've heard mentioned . . . . .   likely some of the Hamilton lads can help you out there. I've also hear that Angling Specialties handles a bit of carp stuff, they're up On Kennedy Road, south of Steeles. (Near Passmore.) And if you buy from the 'net at all, Wackerbaits likely has the best array of stuff for carp you'll find anywhere. Here's another link to lotsa sites you might wish to browse . . .   http://www.carpanglersgroup.com/carplinks.html   Good Luck . . ."
205731,Fang,2008-05-24 17:50:00,1330,Longer drive but usually good selection is Fishing World in Hamilton  I was just in at Bronte Outdoors and they have some basic stuff. If you know what you want They will try and get it for you. Bronte's looking for some rod pods for me.
205747,bassjnkie,2008-05-24 18:38:00,1101,"Fishing Sports has a geat selection, and they just go a huge order in. Tell Gleb that Daniel sent you, he might help you out.

205787,MJL,2008-05-24 21:33:00,2427,Anglers International is bringing in a few bits and bobs of carp tackle  You can see here  http://www.topmixbaits.com/Carp%20Web%20Catalogue%202008.pdf  Here for dealers http://www.topmixbaits.com/dealer_list.htm  I get most of my gear from friends who smuggle in over from the UK  You can get almost anything online or through mail order  I highly recommend ordering from Jeff Vaughan at the Long Sault Motel.  He managed to ship my new baitrunner + other tackle from his place to mine in about 3 days.  You also don't have to pay customs or additional provincial taxes which you'd otherwise pay ordering from the US.

205799,Bojangles,2008-05-24 22:08:00,46,Kris @ Fishonline Canada has a good selectiion of carp gear.. he knows his stuff and I'm sure he'll tell you where the fish are...
