205086,Guest gbfisher,2008-05-23 00:45:00,0,   OK.........Im IN!
205105,fishindevil,2008-05-23 01:03:00,6254,"WOW...Awesome fishing trip jamie !!!!.  ...well done,great pics too...cheers"
205348,Guest Johnny Bass,2008-05-23 16:05:00,0,"Excellent report!!! Salt water fishing is a whole other ball game. 45 minutes to catch a fish??? I think that 20 minutes is the most I would want to fight a fish. After that, its not fun anymore. Its work!lol  Must be great for the heart though! It must have been beating like a jack hammer. And the mouth is pretty thin for that size of fish. I would imagine you would have to hook it on the upper or lower lip.  Anyhoo,congrats on your first Tarpon!"
205528,Crazyhook,2008-05-24 01:02:00,1154,the big one both Nick and I fought it it seemed like forvever... we were both done! and it swam away no worse for ware...
204556,Crazyhook,2008-05-22 00:50:00,1154,"Well got the second batch of pics in today so here they are  Nick meets Leather man ( ironically people asked Nick for a picture because of his tan on the way home)   Tarpon I had on for a good half an hour on the bridge, beat me up good. Tail end of a good jump    lads in Key west  getting primed for our charter in Key west.. hanging out in Margatitaville  5 minutes in... tarpon on! ( ate a pinfish)  Now I am nervous as hell, I have previously hooked 6 tarpon in the last 10 years and had yet to land one  45 minutes in the fish jumps again, panick is setting in  finally in she comes  Landed! 80 pounds of pure muscle  I was so tired I could not lift the anchor. ( found enough strength to hold up a budlite though  Fish busting bait on the surface.... worst time in the world for a birds nest!  Steve catches a mack ( later shark bait)  Nick catches a nice cuda ( also shark bait)   Little blacktip  boatside blacktip  Shaynes 150 pound nurse shark "
204559,Rich Clemens,2008-05-22 00:53:00,3131,Ahhhhhh.  The Florida Keys and Key West.  Been quite a few years since I was down there.  Would love to go back some day.    I'm assuming you all did the Duval Crawl whilst you was there ?  Great report and pics CH.  Can't imagine spending 45 mins to land a single fish.

204627,nautifish,2008-05-22 02:49:00,1416,"12, Blimey.....Do you all fly down or drive down?"
204636,Crazyhook,2008-05-22 03:02:00,1154,"off season... we all flew down, flights were 450 including tax round trip. 3 of the 4 guys caught the biggest fish of thier life ( I would of but I fell asleep!)"
204640,nautifish,2008-05-22 03:04:00,1416,  Jamie drop me a pm.......I'd like to know what roughly the total cost of the trip is.   I think i would probably drive though i love to drive and its  a good excuse to put in some sight seeing also.
