205553,Cookslav,2008-05-24 01:47:00,1457,WOW!  That wasn't game that was a slaughter!!!! Feel a bit bad for the Bulls though...crappy end to a great season.  Geroge and his crew are a class act...so hats of to them as well. But l am looking forward to Sunday big time! As its bound to be a great Game!!! Anyone else lucky enough to score Tickets?
205600,JEREMY,2008-05-24 03:45:00,300,It was not the game i thought it was going to be.I was kind of disappointed.

205669,Cookslav,2008-05-24 14:40:00,1457,"Ya the Hockey house is a fun venue to watch from fer sure. I got stuck working late, so getting to the actual game was out of the cards, but I was lucky enough to score tickets to the Final on Sunday and I am on cloud nine!  I wouldn't trade my Mem. cup tickets for a Stanely cup pair to be honest....not to watch pittsburg and Detroit anyway I'd rather watch my junior home team compete any day.  What a great year for the boys.... They had a free ticket into the round robin, but decided to EARN their way in anyway! They are already winners in my books, a win on Sunday would just be iceing on the cake  But I reeeeely felt bad for bellville....honestly I've been feeding the boys for over 2 weeks now(they are staying at my hotel) And I've been talking with George on and off and can say they are truely a great bunch of guys, they were really hyped up to be here, and they played so well up until last night...just a bad way to end a great season.  I think Suban, and Wilson are gonna feel pretty crappy....They did not play well at all against K-towns big line. When one line scores 15 points combined to enter the all time Memorial cup record books, and you happen to be the deffensive pair that was ""Supposed"" to have stopped them....ya I'd feel like crap too  I have to wonder... heres a small funny, yet not funny peice of Information. Appearently A girls University Soccer team checked in the night before the game....right next door to the Bulls George was not happy. Think it has anything to do with their game play? "

205703,misfish,2008-05-24 16:46:00,29133,"Meant to ask,is Newhamburg still thier farm team?"
206207,Cookslav,2008-05-26 00:13:00,1457,"I think the Junior C are still there?  Tonights game..... What a shame.  Spokane wins by 3....2 short handed goals, on stupid...stupid penalties, and an empty netter. Call it sour grapes but after peppering the Cheifs with 54 shots vs 26  The 2 factors deciding that games were the goal tender(bravo BTW, and the referee's)"
