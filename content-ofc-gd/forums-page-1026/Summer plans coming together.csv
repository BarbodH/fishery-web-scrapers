We've booked into a B&B called Woodgrange Bed and Breakfast.  We have always enjoyed going to B&B's as the food has been awesome at any we've been to in the past and you always meet some great people.    This will be my first open water trip to Nipissing/French and the first time to that end of the lake.  It looks like I won't have to travel too far for some great fishing but any tips are greatly appreciated.    My main question is about charts for that area, where can I get one?  Also was wondering about chips for gps units, do they have anything for this area?  Might be the reason I need to up grade my present unit if you know what I mean.  Bernie, Joe said if I was ever up in the area to be sure to contact you.  So I'm giving you the warning now.  We will be up there the July 29th to August 1st.  Not sure it it will work out or not but it would be nice to hook up for a coffee or maybe some time on the water.  On August 1st we are heading over to Whispering Pines On The Bay on Rock Lake near Killarney.  I can taste the fish and chips from the bus now!  It's looking like a great week."

205363,BillM,2008-05-23 16:58:00,17367,I'll let you know if my Gold+ Navionics chip covers the main channel of the French..  I doubt it though..  Hydro graphs of the French itself are hard to come by.
205378,Bernie,2008-05-23 17:20:00,3190,"Fishinsled, you will be at the opposite end of the lake from me. 50 to 60 miles away. Did the trip in a boat last year to Lakair. Took an hour and a half in good conditions in a boat. My brother has a Garmin Rino with maps of both ends of the lake. I used it to navigate to Lakair. Worked great. Can't seem to get the west end of the map on to my Rino."
205401,fishnsled,2008-05-23 18:39:00,3520,"Hey Bernie, nothing like a little adventure if the conditions will allow.  I'll look into a mortgage for the gas and will let you know.  Thanks Gerritt and BillM.  Looking forward to your report BillM and and you're bang on about the fish and chips Gerritt.  Big portions too!"
205407,ccmtcanada,2008-05-23 18:45:00,7971,Wait a minute Will....  I don't remember the invite to this weekend?  Hmmmm.....  Must be lost in the mail.....LOL    
205412,Headhunter,2008-05-23 18:55:00,5703,"Bernie... Will's not at all like me... he's actually a really nice guy! LOL Worth the drive Will, just probably not by boat! HH"
205437,fishnsled,2008-05-23 20:11:00,3520, Don't you remember Bly saying something about leaving you and the kids at home the next time that I was going fishing....
205458,ccmtcanada,2008-05-23 21:23:00,7971, LOL....I guess I was just owned....
