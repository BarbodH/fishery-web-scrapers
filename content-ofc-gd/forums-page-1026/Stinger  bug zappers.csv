205531,bow slayer,2008-05-24 01:10:00,1074,Has anyone tried one of the Stinger bug zappers? Walmart sells them starting at about 45 bucks up to 75 bucks.  I bought one that is 3000 volts and covers up to a .5 acre. I bought at Walmart in the US for about half the price. I have not tried it out yet just wondering if anyone has tried one and what they thought about them. I am hoping they keep the bugs away while camping this summer to reduce the use of deet. thanks

205591,Crazyhook,2008-05-24 03:17:00,1154,don't lick it no matetr how much your friends bug you too... trust me
205592,gone_fishin,2008-05-24 03:24:00,481," there are ""good"" insects? they all bug the hell outta me, even if they're not biting or stinging me!"
205596,ccmtcanada,2008-05-24 03:33:00,7971,"Be sure to install it in the proper location.  For instance, I see a lot of them on the corner of a deck...that's the wrong place.  The idea is to place it away from where you will be sitting....so if you are worried about a deck, then place it away from it or else you are just attracting them where you will be hanging around.   Others will place them so that the direct path to the zapper takes them across the deck as well.  Anyhow, you probably get the picture."
205867,bow slayer,2008-05-25 01:40:00,1074,I bought it to help reduce the bugs around our campsite at Restoule PP. The mossies are thick and I hate covering the kids in deet all the time. I will be placing it away from us to draw them away. It comes with a lure.

206012,Sinker,2008-05-25 16:49:00,8692,"Try a Thermacell. Bugs just seem to dissappear when you turn it on. They don't cover a large area, but a couple around a camp fire makes a BIG difference.  Sinker"
