456359,mepps,2010-04-15 15:50:00,1301,"I've been exploring some new waters here in Nova Scotia recently. Found a jem of a spot thanks to a recommendation from a co-worker and checked it out last night. I caught 3 different species (I think!) and figured I'd ask you guys for some help!  I've searched several sites to find images of small Atlantic salmon in parr and smolt stage and I'm almost certain some of the fish I caught were salmon - what do you think?  I used this site as a reference - http://www.atlanticsalmontrust.org/salmon_facts/recognition.html  Sea trout or Atlantic salmon - by the markings I believe it to be salmon!   Sea trout or Atlantic - This one I believe to be a sea trout!   I landed about 10 this size and had two bigger brook trout in 1.5 hours of fishing. All fish caught on a # 2 silver Mepps Aglia.  I ended the trip with my biggest trout in Nova Scotia!    And finally, check out the pseudo scorpion I found in my bathroom!  "
456361,Harrison,2010-04-15 15:57:00,2202,"I think your right about the species!  Ps. since you've been on this board, how many places have you lived? I remember a few tarpon posts from you in the BVI if I remember right!  Love those ones!"
456364,Spiel,2010-04-15 15:57:00,9065,"The little guys appear to be small Atlantics Clive but that's only my best guess. Love the Brookie, not so much the spider."
456367,mepps,2010-04-15 16:01:00,1301,"Dont worry spiel, that guy was tiny (fruit fly size) and they do more good then harm apparently - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudoscorpion  Harrison - since I've been on the board Ive lived in Port credit (mississauga), London (ON), La Paz (Mexico) and Tortola (BVI) - Moved to Halifax 2.5 years ago!  I wish I was still in the BVI though, I really miss those tarpon!"
456371,TC1OZ,2010-04-15 16:06:00,987,Sweet post! The only time I catch 10 fish in 1.5 hours is when they are rockbass lol!
456373,MJL,2010-04-15 16:07:00,2427,The little ones appear to be baby Atlantics.  The mouth doesn’t seem to extend past the eye and the spots don’t seem to go very far below the lateral line.  Only 1 spot on the gill plate.  Rough guess though.  Here’s a link http://www.loughs-agency.org/conservation/content.asp?catid=360  The brookie is a beauty  Thanks for sharing Clive.
456375,craigdritchie,2010-04-15 16:10:00,1586,Atlantic salmon. Atlantic salmon. Very nice brook trout. Creepy crawly.
456376,MJL,2010-04-15 16:12:00,2427, You got the last one partially right Craig...It looks like PRIME trout bait
456394,mepps,2010-04-15 17:14:00,1301,"Awesome, thanks guys - my first Atlantic!"
456496,craigdritchie,2010-04-15 21:39:00,1586,"Sure does, but I don't think I'd want a bag of those guys loose in my vest. It's bad enough when you accidentally drop a roe bag down your waders. Imagine one of those little guys? Yikes!"
456498,laszlo,2010-04-15 21:45:00,487,Mepps Silver Aglia with hooks dressed (all sizes) have caught me tons of fish over the years.
456627,highdrifter,2010-04-16 04:00:00,2534,Nice!  It's about time!  Keep plugging that drift bud..  There's gotta be a lunker spring salmon still hanging around.  very kewl.  HD
456632,Sinker,2010-04-16 04:20:00,8692,cool stuff Clive. Try a red devil.........seriously.  S.
456653,solopaddler,2010-04-16 10:30:00,8605,First two are both salmon parr. Tail is too forked in the second one to be a trout.  Seriously nice brook trout man!
