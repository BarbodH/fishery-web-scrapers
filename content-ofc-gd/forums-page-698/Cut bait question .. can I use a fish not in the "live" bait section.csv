I would hope that any warden that caught a guy doing just that would let it slide and if it was technically illegal, just a warning to not do it again. To charge a guy in this instance the CO is just being an"

End of discussion. One CO may not fine you for perch eyes etc. but another very well could.  You keep saying ""sunfish"", which only refers to the family Centrarchidae. Guess what species are considered sunfish and fall within this family? Bass! If you are going to keep a bunch of pumpkinseeds for bait, why can't I head down to the local lake and bring home a limit of largemouth or smallmouth for bait?  I think this thread has served its purpose and you can give up the ""but it says you can't use them alive! "" argument, because it isn't gonna fly."

448422,brifishrgy,2010-03-26 15:41:00,559,"  thanks for your opinion but I am looking for the facts  here is the definition of organic bait  Organic bait – Natural bait comprised of live or dead organisms (animals or plants), derivatives, or parts thereof. This can include minnows, leeches, frogs, insects, worms, fish eggs, cut bait, corn, macaroni, pet food, cheese or similar substances.     Fly materials, such as deer hair, or rubber baits impregnated with artificial scents are not considered organic bait."
448426,cheaptackle,2010-03-26 15:56:00,849,"Fact is you can't use sunfish or any other game fish as bait unless specifically excepted. Hope that is what the confirmation you are waiting for from the MNR will reveal. I'd hate like hell to see you or anyone pinched for trying it, especially after asking for and receiving the number of ""don't do it's"" on this thread. If you do try it, and do get charged, let us know what the fine is and what your experiences with it were, please?  I'd rather not hear it happened, but IF it does it would be educational for the rest of us.  Good Luck!  Michael"
448439,Jer,2010-03-26 16:33:00,1426,"I would think that using any edible portion (ie. fillet) of a sunfish or perch for bait would be illegal. Technically, it could be construed as wasting the meat.  Any other parts (ie. eyes, skin, etc.) would probably fall under the category of ""fish parts"" and be OK for bait."
448442,brifishrgy,2010-03-26 16:36:00,559, I agree .. you probably are not allowed to use it Ontario but the definition of organic bait doesnt specify what fish can and cant be used.
448475,rigger,2010-03-26 18:21:00,8,"Herring is one exception that allows you to use it as specified for baitfish.  Any fish classified as ""Game Fish"" cannot be used as bait.  You can use other suckers as dead bait but they have the classification of ""Caution"" for various reasons.  Some other suckers are ""illegal"" used dead or alive.  The following link is the DFO's of Canada.  Check it out.  Remember to check your Zone in the 2010 fishing regulations for added restictions.  http://www.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/regions/central/pub/baitfish-appat-on/index-eng.htm  Hope this helps, Rob!"

You may not use the edible parts of game fish for bait in Ontario.  By using sunfish or bluegill for bait you would be wasting flesh suitable for human consumption.  You may use the inedible parts of game fish left over after you clean the meat (fillet) off them.  This would include the head, fins, entrails and eyes or the whole filleted carcass.  This is providing the lake you are fishing on does not have a restriction on organic bait.

I have sent the MNR the same question .. weather or not I get a reply I will have to see  you hear about people using perch eyes as bait .. but its not a perch .. its organic bait  salmon/trout eggs get used as bait because its organic bait  the filet of the fish should be the same .. just want to be sure before I try it

MNR C.O. buddy said that technically charges could be laid because perch are a game fish, the skins are part of said fish, and more complex charges could be laid if said bait was used where perch don't occur naturally. I argued the live vs. not alive, and I think I lost (he was a little better at legalese than me). The regs do say ""only the fish species listed  below..."" at the top of the list, and sunfish aren't on it.  Michael"

The answer I got (which we've all heard before) is that the regs we get copies of are summaries of volumes of legislation.  Bottom line, I was told it's still classed as live even if its dead unless specifically excepted (i.e. salties in certain circumstances). I only put the start of the sentence in to identify the section of the regs as opposed to making any point. What I'm merely suggesting is that I wouldn't do it just because of what I've read & heard.  I don't see the words ""dead"" in that section so I'm not going to make any determination about it.

Especially since (I'm told) the law was enacted to prevent introducing non-indigenous species (e.g. perch to a trout lake etc). I'm way out of touch with using roe, but isn't there an exception for it in the regs somewhere?  I don't currently use it personally and can't remember from years ago when I did. Never had that discussion with my friend and can't recall seeing anything about it, but I wasn't looking either. Might it have something to do with how they're preserved?

I have run tests with same flashers and same heads with one of them with meat and one with fake stuff. The action is so good with fake that 80% of fish came off of fake. Try it yourself. leather belt, thin rubber,old boat bumber, mouse pads, the list is endless. just cut up into strips same shape as cut bait. the best part of it it you can take hit after hit and never have to change your bait.
