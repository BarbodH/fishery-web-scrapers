456699,GBW,2010-04-16 14:15:00,8460,Hey folks.  Does anyone know where I can get a low cost 12-volt 7amp battery charger?  I need one for my FishTV so my kids can have some fun in the boat this season.  Thanks.  Geoff
456708,scugpg,2010-04-16 14:45:00,1373,Wouldn't say its low cost but its high performance with 5yr warranty.  Get the CTEK 3300 from Canadian tire. It'll to 2ah to 90ah or larger with ease.  http://www.canadiantire.ca/AST/browse/4/Auto/BatteryChargersAccessories/BatteryChargers/PRDOVR~0111522P/CTEK%252BMulti-use%252B3300%252B3.3A%252BBattery%252BCharger.jsp  Search around maybe Canadian tire will match someone else.  I have 2 and they are great.
