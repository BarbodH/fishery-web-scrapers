456643,spincast,2010-04-16 09:08:00,3279,"Kind of hard to tell from the pic, but the most common in this part of the world are sharp shinned and red tails. The red tail is very prominent in flight. If you can see it while gliding you shoudl be able see the red tail if its one - otherwise most liekly going to be a sharp shinned."
456644,tightline,2010-04-16 09:14:00,322," If you click on the pics they get a bit bigger...the bird is only about 13"" tall so I was thinking it wasn't a red tail.  Never heard of a sharp shinned though. thanks spincast"
456651,singingdog,2010-04-16 10:25:00,1047,"It looks like a sharp shinned hawk. A redtail has a ""waistcoat"" of dark streaking across it's lower breast and does not have the barred tail that this hawk has. It's probably checking out the other birds in your yard, looking for something to eat."

456689,4thgen,2010-04-16 13:44:00,157,"Sharp-shinned hawks and Cooper's hawks are almost identical except for their size, with Cooper's being slightly larger (although a big female Sharpie can be about the same size as a small male Cooper's). It is always hard to get a real perspective in pictures, but if you think it is only about 13"" chances are good that it is a Sharp-shinned.  Do you or your neighbours have a bird feeder? Most people don't realize that bird feeders can often supply more than just seed-eaters! The Accipiter family that includes both Cooper's and Sharpies is made up of specialized bird hunters. You'll notice long tails and short stubby wings that make them very maneuverable, especially when chasing smaller birds through the forest."
