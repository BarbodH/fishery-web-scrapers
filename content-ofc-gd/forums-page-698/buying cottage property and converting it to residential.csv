454641,JohnF,2010-04-11 14:10:00,3494," Don't worry about offending realtors. One thing we quickly acquire is thick skin. Lotsa rejection in our business, ya know.  Something you should know, a kind of industry maxim - ""Buyer are liars"". Pretty cynical sounding I know but if you had any idea how often prospective buyers come to us describing exactly what they want and then turn around and buy something totally different you'd understand. A while back I met a very nice couple looking to buy. They insisted it had to be an older red brick. I wasn't to waste their time or mine with anything else. Well, after going round and round with them they're buying a modern yellowy tan brick.    It happens so often that many in our industry just figure they might as well over inform rather than under inform. In fact there's a section in our legislative regulations (that's our provincial law) that says something like ""registrants (that's us realtors) must make every attempt to advise clients of all properties for sale that might suit their needs regardless of the commission offered etc"".  Lately our industry has been under a little bit of an attack over our advertising website and much of the nonsense published in the media is pretty distorted, the same kind of misrepresentation we'd be crucified over in our own advertising. Our industry is trying to take the high road on this though so we've been keeping media quotes to a minimum and have gone the route of letting our lawyers do our talking for us.  But as is often the case here on OFC we all (me included) get to feeling like we're just sitting around gabbing over a few beers with our buddies so we open up a bit more. I guess it's just human nature to want to speak up for yourself at some point, particularly when it's just amongst friends.  What you said has been uttered in the media in much more insulting fashion by folks with a personal axe to grind. It seems to be human nature to spread the word about bad experiences but to stay mum on the good ones. In fact much of what you said is true but only about a certain shrinking element of our industry. For what it's worth we really are working hard at educating (that's coincidentally one of my jobs) all our members to raise the bar to a standard where the consumer public can put their trust in us. Hopefully the days of ""caveat emptor"" (buyer beware) are behind us and though I no longer know the latin for it I'd like to be able to say to the public that the days of ""trust your agent"" are here. As I've already said there are more than enough truly good realtors out there that all any of you should have to do is ask around amongst your friends for recommendations. Odds are they've already told you about the bad experiences but you'll have to ask for the good ones. And don't ever think that our industry is the only one with it's black sheep. Over my many years in the business I've encountered mortgage brokers, lawyers, accountants and contractors that I wouldn't want to have handle my business and I find ways to advise my own clients about them. But each industry is working at raising their respective bars so it's getting better.  Buying and selling real estate is a huge commitment financially and emotionally. There are an awful bunch of landmines involved in a real estate transaction and consumers really should avoid the risk of flying blind, ignoring the trained competent service providers available to work for you - lawyers, appraisers, mortgage brokers, Ontario Land Surveyors, home inspectors, various contractors, professional planners, etc - oh, and of course real estate salespersons.  As long as I've been a member of OFC I've always tried to give the best advice I have to anyone needing help with a real estate related problem anywhere in the province. I prefer to do it privately because there is occasionally personal information has to be discussed. Also we have pretty strict legal regulations about interfering in other realtors' transactions so sometimes I have to stay mum or beg off on helping but I do what I can. It's just that I hate to hear stories of folks getting hurt in botched real estate transactions. Those deals always somehow seem to taint the industry whether it was our fault or not. I don't expect to be paid for my advice given here. If it really works out well then a day out fishing on your boat is nice though.  JF"
455171,pike slayer,2010-04-12 22:28:00,1177,SO i called my lawyer first thing this morning and he called me back at around 11. He told me that he was typing out a letter to send to the owners lawyer to see if his lawyer will second that its a year round home to help try and convince the bank. I also told him the website to the listing to show that they said its a year round home. i didnt here back from him today and i hope to hear from him tomorrow morning. just giving an update.
455192,fish_fishburn,2010-04-12 23:06:00,1311,"Wormdangler, I hope everything works out for you. I am sure your Realtor is busting his butt to get this issue resolved for you. I hear people slagging realtors all the time as crooks etc. But most of the time they are just repeating something they heard from someone else.  Most people in the general public have no idea what a Realtor has to do to get there license and retain it. It comes up for renewel every two years and if you haven't taken your update courses and other courses to achieve the amount of credits required you will not get renewed it doesn't matter how long you have been in the business.  I have one more exam to write before I embark on a new career in Real Estate and I can hardly wait. I just hope there are people like John in the brokerage where I decide to work. And I'm sure there will be."

My lawyer called me this afternoon, and he told me that he spoke to the owners lawyer and the lawyer spoke to the owner and he also talked to the real estate lady that i was dealing with. The owners lawyer says the owners says they have been living in it full time for the past 4 years but never rezoned it. The real estate lady is saying that she had no idea i was buying it as a year round home and thought i was buying it as a cottage. I told my lawyer that she damn well knew i was buying it as a year round home and shes lying to cover her ass and besides it says ""cottage or year round home"" right on the listing so shes already caught up in her own lie. Then my lawyer tolds me well then we have a situation on our hands and i think you better come down to my office as soon as we can to figure this out. So tomorrow im heading to his office on my lunch break to see what the heck is up! URRGGHH this is annoying!!"

We came up with keep going ahead to see if the bank will cooperate with us and give me the mortgage anyways and deal with all the headaches of rezoning and what not after. If that fails then all we got left to do is fight over who takes blame for all this. he said if it ever does go to court that i have a very good chance of winning because the court doesnt like to see ppl get screwed around. so on with another day of this! holy i hear from him tomorrow as to what the bank says so i know what to perpare for. ohhh joy what an experience this has been attempting to buy my first home.

My brother is looking at buying a house and i've been helping him out a bit. what ive noticed is you really have to jump on deals cause they go FAST. alot of the nicer houses are gone even before the sign goes up in the yard. find out what exactly you want and even get a real estate agent looking for you. good luck and let me know what you come up with!

453968,pike slayer,2010-04-09 22:03:00,1177,"hey guys, so im in the process of buying my first home. seeing is how im on this site im an outdoors kinda guy and i do not want to live in town. i found this cute house about 20min outside of town at prince lake in prince township. heres the listing.... http://www.hometownrealestate.ca/listings/details.php3?listingID=560 the lake is just to the right out of the picture at the tree line. theres decent smallie fishing with challenging speckie fishing and with a nice sand beach right there. the deal went through for $93,500. so everything was all approved and the house is suppose to close April 16th. NOW!! My lawyer calls me today and hes like ummmm the property down as ""recreational property"" and the township is trying to say they dont want anymore year round homes on the lake, they want just cottages but half the lake is year round homes. Its listed on the real estate listing as a ""year round home"" and thats what im suppose to be buying. I told my lawyer this and i said well i'll print out the listing to show that and he said he MIGHT be able to fight it but no promises. I mean i put my down payment on the place, all other paper work is through and its hung up on this. has anyone had to deal with this before? what can i do to get around it? if the deal does fall through would there be some sort of penalty for me? i was misinformed! its friday and the lawyer called me at 4:20 today while i was still at work to tell me the great news. i have to stress all weekend about it grrrrrrrrr"
453980,cheaptackle,2010-04-09 22:17:00,849,"It's all dependent on the local zoning.  I know of people who have to spend at least 30 consecutive days residing elsewheres in order to avoid the higher taxes of year round zoning.  They go to Florida for the winter anyhow so no big deal for them.  If the township isn't granting any further rezoning/reclassifications you might be in a pickle.  Not sure how much impact the original listing will have over the signed agreement of purchase & sale, it usually is the governing document but you MIGHT be able to argue the listing was your motivation to purchase.  It gets a little twisted but essentially you agreed to purchase based on beliefs as stated, but if the purchase/sale agreement you signed states otherwise you'd be in for a battle. Your lawyer is your best bet for accurate information.  His saying he MIGHT be able to fight it suggests he's thinking along the same lines- a key expectance from the agreement was not fact in reality, you expected a year round residence only to find at the eleventh hour that it was not the case. The best you can hope for is cancellation of the sale and return of the deposit (less your lawyers fees probably).  The worse is completing the purchase and fighting for rezoning.  Again, seek the counsel of your lawyer.  Michael"

Also in march they released a thing saying that starting march 27,2010 they will start working on adding towers/ cell range all the way from sault ste. marie north to thunder bay, so by the end of the summer all roger clients should have cell service the whole way where as right now telus/bell customers only have small areas where cells work with lots of dead spots. i have the document stating all this, if you want more info Pm me and i'll forward it to you."
454032,grt1,2010-04-09 23:17:00,638,"here's the way I see it.  you have to check the official plan for the township, this is the ""official"" zoning for your prospective property. It has to go through several layers of approval to get put into place and it costs thousands to the township to get approved . So it your property is listed as R1 (which is normally residential) or R4 (which is normally rural residential) you are probably ok for year round occupancy, but if the property is designated as seasonal then you SHOULD go and apply for a zoning change. However, in my own opinion, I would tell the township if others are allowed year round occupancy on the lake, you expect to be treated the same way and not descriminated against (this could really stir the pot as no politician likes to be called for descriminating).  good luck,"
454035,cheaptackle,2010-04-09 23:20:00,849,"I think that's the ""MIGHT"" part of the lawyer's statement, Wayne & worm dangler.  He's (lawyer) possibly going to use the listing as the basis for withdrawing the offer legally as the end ""product"" is not as originally advertised, ergo misleading.  The premises of ""offer and acceptance"" in law goes back almost to the first laws governing commerce ever written in that there must be a ""meeting of the minds"" or BOTH parties to a transaction having clear knowledge of what to expect and receive.  worm dangler expects a year round home  - and he ain't getting one it seems, ergo no meeting of the minds.  This is a grossly simplified view of the actual legalese which is why I kept referring worm dangler to the counsel of his lawyer.  What I've said in a few lines would run into pages upon pages of legal size paper in fine print.  Keep the faith, worm dangler.  I hope it will come to bear that what you wanted and what you got were two different things and that your lawyer will be able to close this in your favour, nobody can be reasonably expected to purchase something other than that which was advertised.  I hope you were also using a real estate agent to represent yourself and have leaned on him as well.  Michael"

I've been down the road before.. dreams are dreams but sometimes you've gotta say WHOA !.. and take your money back for false advertising if there appears to be issues on title search.
454044,JohnF,2010-04-09 23:28:00,3494," Does the zoning actually state no year round occupation? If the municipality realizes they may be dealing with litigation because of an arbitrary position they might relent unless it's a clear violation of the bylaw.  Did your mortgage lender approve the loan on the basis of it being for year round occupation? If so they might pull the mortgage on you which would make it tough to close.  Interesting situation. I'll be watching this thread with professional interest to see how it gets resolved. And no, I'm not a lawyer.  JF"
454048,Jer,2010-04-09 23:32:00,1426,"   This is what I would be concerned about. Generally, a bank won't offer a 5% down mortgage on what they might consider a ""recreational property""."
454054,JohnF,2010-04-09 23:37:00,3494," I disagree with your comment about putting up sold signs before the closing. In fact it gets really complicated to put up a sold sign after the close. I've been putting up sold signs as soon as the conditions are all met for 35 years and so have all the realtors I know, and trust me, I know a lot of 'em all over the province.

Then found out it was a property with stipulations and no commuter service. I made the right noises and the cheque was returned the next day. Sadly , one learns to trust no one as your benefit is not what they are out for."
454070,JohnF,2010-04-09 23:56:00,3494, Explain in very clear terms to your lawyer that you bought on the basis that it was for year round habitation and ask what the seller's recourse is against you. I'm sure he'll tell you the seller could sue for specific performance (close the deal as per agreement) and a court might support that. If you can't get the mortgage money in light of this new information then you could be held responsible for any losses incurred by the seller while the property is put back on the market and sold again.  Questions - Did you make it clear to everyone involved you were buying it for a year round place? Did anyone advise you about the restricted use? Did you have a realtor working as your agent for the deal?  Obviously the cleanest solution is for the municipality to allow year round occupation. The listing realtor might be helpful in getting that okayed at town hall. Surely his ad was based on solid info. Perhaps he can get some leverage.  JF

454215,Chris,2010-04-10 11:08:00,405,"Never believe anything you read in a real eastate listing. Check all info yourself before you put in your offer. My wife and I currently own a few (and have owned a few more) income properties and have used several different agents when buying/selling. For example, we recently purchased a property and the listing had several errors. It listed the roof as ashphalt shingles...it was tin sheeting, listed as gas water heater....it was electric....listed the taxes at one amount...they were several hundred dollars more....and the list went on. But we had checked all that before putting in the offer. No offense to your profession John, but agents want to sell houses and many times they tell you what you want to hear. Every single property we have sold has sold for a significantly higher amount than what the real estate agent suggested listing it for. In my experience if you're selling, the agent wants a quick sale to get his cut, so they lowball it to get a quick sale. If you're buying, they are really no different than a car saleaman.  My advice is check everything yourself, and know exactly what you are buying, before you make an offer.  You can apply to have your property rezoned and just because the township may not want any more residential year-round homes dosn't mean they won't allow it. The property we just purchased was a laundromat with a two bedroom apartment on the second floor and was zoned as res/com. At first the township stated that they have a shortage of commercial space and they did not want to lose any more commercial space, but once they knew I was spending money to change the usage of the building, they saw development fees, rezoning fees and building permit fees, and the dollar signs started rolling around in their heads, they allowed it to be rezoned as res/com with a G5 exception....which allows us to convert the laundromat into a main floor 2 bedroom apt. It was approx. $1000 to rezone it and $2000 for development fees (which is another bunch of Bull when it's an existing property...but that's a story for another day). Townships are all about collecting money and when they can get a few thou $$$ more of taxpayers cash they can quickly change their tune."

But My realtor, the owner(i spoke with him when signing papers at the real estate office when i first put in my offer. he is also the guy with the contract that plows the road and does road repair) and the lawyer all know i want to buy it as year round. The lawyer said the only thing going for me right now is if i can show on paper saying that is year around which was on the listing.Its all about proving it to the bank to give me the mortgage. It was taken off the MLS site well over a week ago but i looked on the real estate site and as you can see its still on there. i printed it out so i have it on paper and calling the lawyer and send him the link and if i had to drive to the office and give him the printed out paper showing it.

454341,JohnF,2010-04-10 17:52:00,3494," I can't disagree with everything you've said but in defence of our industry there really are a lot of safeguards built in for the public. The act that regulates our licensing includes language that essentially reiterates much of what the Competition Bureau expects of all business people dealing with Canadian consumers. One of the things that's directly addressed is misrepresentation in advertising. That makes it a double whammy for us when we do skate too close to the line. Many of us really try to honour the letter and spirit of the law. We know it reflects badly on all of us when a few try to skate. One way to get a good realtor is to talk to friends who had positive experiences. Trust me, if there was anything at all to criticise they probably will.  The consumer really should be able to trust information offered in listings and ads as reliable and accurate to the best of the ability of the seller and the realtor to provide it. Anything else is misrepresentation and as I said not tolerated by the law. We are expected to not only pass along any material facts about the property that are provided but in the case of a client (buyer who signs an agreement to work exclusively with our brokerage to find a property) we are expected to go some extra distance to verify the provided information and to ferret out other relevant information about possible hidden problems including some stigmas and latent defects. This doubles your chances of catching mistakes before they bite you in the ass. It's surprising how much information is available to us in the industry when we know where to look. We pay for access to places to find it out as well as relying on our personal training and experience in the market. It's always a nice feeling to be able to fill folks in who've entrusted their home buying to me. Once I know what they want and don't want I have a lot of knowledge, experience and resources to use for their benefit. That doesn't make me smarter or better than the average realtor, just typical of conscientious realtors who make the extra effort to provide the best possible service to our clients.  As long as I'm up on my soapbox here I might as well also say that what I've described is what should be expected by any consumers who entrust their home buying and selling to a good responsible realtor. Buying and selling for yourself may work out okay but are you ever sure the price was right (high enough as a seller, low enough as a buyer) and what about the latent defects or even the patent defects that should have been brought to your attention, or that you should have disclosed as a seller? A lawyer friend of mine called me the other day to share a laugh. He read me some language from a client's DIY offer on their property. Of course he didn't mention names or addresses. These sellers were pretty smug about all the money they thought they'd saved until he pointed out that they had agreed to include all their appliances, furniture, clothing and even cars in the agreement. Just one innocuous and legal sounding sentence used the wrong way did that. As it turned out the buyers weren't nasty types who could have insisted on all of it. They agreed that that was not the intent but I've seen a lot of buyers over the years who would have jumped all over an opportunity like that. Another common oversight is to agree to discharge your mortgage without checking to see what penalties are involved. Surprising how many folks aren't aware of that one. Penalties can be tens of thousands of dollars today. I just heard of a girl who was faced with a $20,000 penalty. Zoning issues are another big problem. That's why I keep a copy of the local zoning bylaw at my desk and it gets used regularly. To those of you who insist on dealing without the help of a good realtor at least refuse to sign anything until you've had your lawyer okay it. The lawyer probably won't be able to help you much with value etc but at least he can help you avoid some of the pitfalls. And do you know what constitutes a good survey and how to read a drawing if provided? Do you know if a survey will be required for mortgage purposes or if the one provided by the seller will be acceptable to the mortgagee? And so on and so on.  And don't rely on advice from your friends unless they have some credible basis for it. ""He said, she said"" just doesn't work well in court. Take this thread for instance. There's a lot of good advice has been offered, and some that is close to correct but not quite and then some that just doesn't fly at all. How do you know what to believe? Even relying on a friend's experience with a situation several hundred miles away may lead to trouble. Zoning bylaws and enforcement vary from municipality to municipality. Each community must have it's own Official Plan and must keep it current and in keeping with the Planning Act but no two Plans are the same, nor is the enforcement process. Some communities may use Site Plan Agreements to create exceptions to the written bylaw for specific areas. And the zoning designations aren't necessarily consistent from bylaw to bylaw. My own municipality a few years ago redesignated the whole city. The result was essentially similar to what had existed before so you really have to read the bylaw carefully to catch the changes. Some of them are pretty subtle but nonetheless painful if you transgress. You need to know how all these regulations might impact your property.  Since there aren't many members here from my market area I hope this won't be construed as spamming. It's just that it really bugs me when I hear people talk about ""slimy"" realtors not being worth their fees. Every industry has it's share of black sheep, including mine. Honestly, I'm the one cheering the loudest when those guys get bit by the law. And I'm not gonna touch the commission debate here. You might be really surprised at what I have to say in private though.  Respectfully JF"

You do have a responsibility to the seller as you have a contract and may be liable for his additional expenses ... if any. However the law is also very clear re the responsibilities of the agent(s). If you have legal problems as a result of agent misrepresentation you should be able to 'lay them at the door' of the offending agent. BTW the agent is actually the firm who employs the sales rep who sold you the property, that would be the broker of ABC Realty who employs the salesperson. If you no longer trust the 'rep' talk to his broker ...who is the actual 'agent'. Don't deal with the rep anymore. Keep copies of all your paperwork including the listing, make notes of what you were told, when and by who. If you encounter problems there shouldn't be penalties that won't be covered by the agents. If you incur significant costs resulting from agent misrepresentation talk to his/her broker and give them the opportunity to 'reimburse you in full before you file a complaint'. They'll probably bend over backwards. Try not to worry too much, it should resolve itself quickly.  Just to cover all the bases, make sure that the lawyer is right! lawyers (like agents) are not perfect! It would be a shame to lose the property because the lawyer erred. I suggest you take your copy of the offer into the planning department at the municipality. A clerk there can pull the file and explain the limitations of permanent occupancy on the property, or reassure you that there won't be a problem. Don't even remotely  consider suggestions that you close and try to bluff your way into full time occupancy if it's not 'legal use'.  'Broad brush' comments regarding the character, motivation and integrity of real estate agents demonstrate ignorance on the part of the contributor(s).  There are 45000 agents and brokers in Ontario who are required to fulfill ongoing training to remain lisenced. Almost all of them are competant. Any agent who does sloppy work for a cheque won't be in the business for long. If you hire an agent, ask friends or family for a referral ... and respect their time. Avoid phone calls before 8:00 a.m. or after 10:00 p.m. unless urgent. Remeber, they might like to get out fishing once in a while too.  I earn what I'm paid by working long hours evenings weekends and holidays (including Christmas and Easter). I'm just a guy with four kids who don't turn out the lights like the rest of you. I don't go around looking for a soapbox but sometimes enough is enough....and I don't fish muskie"
454607,Chris,2010-04-11 12:50:00,405,"Hi JohnF, didn't mean to imply that we have bought and sold properties without an agent. We have always used an agent and I would agree that most times a property is sold much quicker if sold thru an agent. I was only pointing out to others that YOU, the buyer (or seller) are the only one ultimately responsible for signing on the dotted line and if you assume that everything is being taken care of by others, you may be setting yourself up for frustration and potential losses. There are lots of good, honest agents and JohnF, according to the character you continue to demonstrate here on OFC I am sure you are one of them.  Here is another example of what I'm talking about. Back in 1991 when I was looking to purchase my first home, I went thru 3 real estate agents in a relatively short period of time. I had written a list of ""needs"" and ""wants"" and they kept bringing me listings that were no where near what I was looking for, most times even out of my price range. After investigating things on my own I found out that all the listings I was being shown had been on the market for extended periods of time. I took that to mean that they were trying to unload the undesireables on an unsuspecting newbie to the game.  In regards to fshrgy's comments  I agree wholeheartedly with your comment....that's why I'm glad that nowhere in my original post do I paint real estate agents with a broad brush. After over 15 years experience I am hardly ignorant on the subject. I really hope that you do not believe that everyone in your profession is infallable. Now THAT would be demonstrating ignorance.   Don't know exactly what you read into my post, but I will try to word things more carefully in the future so as not to offend anyone."
