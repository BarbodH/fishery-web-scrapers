456603,HTHM,2010-04-16 02:40:00,4082,"I bought a pair of Raybans 2.5 - 3 years ago,thinking that if I am going to pay over 250 dollars, I should get sonething good that will last me the rest of my life. Well,last Saturday the arm fell off. No warrantee, and replacement parts are $88.00 I went the web site, no contact information at all just selling. Not that impressed with the customer service. These were NOT abused at all, used for driving and fishing. So now I am going to have to get a new pair, they will not be Rayban. End Rant."
456605,TC1OZ,2010-04-16 02:42:00,987,"You get what you pay for.  Unfortunately, you paid for the brand and not the quality."
456610,Toronto_Angler,2010-04-16 02:58:00,698,Sirry you had such a bad experience. Had my ray bans for about 5 years now and abused the hell out of them but they sit on my face as good as new
456613,John Bacon,2010-04-16 03:03:00,3277,All of my Ray Bans have been great.  My friend used to get me a 67% discount when she worked at Bausch & Lomb; otherwise I wouldn't have quite so many pairs.  I think Bausch & Lomb has sold the brand... I am not sure if that has effected quality.
456618,DRIFTER_016,2010-04-16 03:33:00,10439,"Mine have been good also. I did break a temple hinge several years ago in Alaska but luckily it was covered under warranty. If you're looking for good shades at a great price The Maddison River Fishing company is clearing out some discontinued Smith Action Optic polarized glasses. Buy the photo chromic glass lens ones as the darken when it gets briter and are more scratch resistant than the polycarbonite lenses. For $79 you can't go wrong. I just bought a pair yesterday. I see they are now sold out of the ones I purchased, so if you're interested I wouldn't wait.  Oh, I almost forgot, shipping was $8.95.  Smith Action Optics Sunglasses on Sale"
456619,MJL,2010-04-16 03:41:00,2427,Been super happy with my pair of Raybans...Been wearing the same pair since 2003.  Definitely haven't been babying them one bit.
456621,fishing n autograph,2010-04-16 03:50:00,2540,If you wanna pay for the name and quality...buy yourself a pair of the 'Classic' style of Oakleys....i've used and abused mine since 2006 and they're still in great shape...best to jump the border though. I bought mine for $110 in ny state....they were regular price $185 at home
456688,GBW,2010-04-16 13:39:00,8460,"Do you wear perscription glasses?  Do you have coverage?  My RayBan's have been great for many years.  I got a new set a year ago only because I wanted lighter lenses.  Who said they sold it (B&L) off is correct, many years ago."
456711,steelhead197,2010-04-16 14:47:00,38,Checked out the sale Drifter had mentioned.....WOW what deals!!
456718,blaque,2010-04-16 15:13:00,2419,"I refuse to spend money on sunglasses lol.  At the rate i sit on them, drop them in water, scratch them when put in the center counsel, drop them off the ski left.....leave them on the volleyball court etc etc etc..........I opt for the cheapos"
456797,Uncle Buck,2010-04-16 18:52:00,1000,"i bought maui jims...  haven't used them much cause to chicken to drop/scratch/lose them...  glue started coming undone in the case... send an email in, and 2 weeks later i got a new case...  great customer service  also very surprising how many ""expensive"" glasses are not Polarized.... $200+ and all you're getting is a plastic lens, screw that... then i'll shop at the gypsy karts at the mall... 2 for $20"
456803,Raf,2010-04-16 19:05:00,3495,can't speak for the raybans but the costa del mar's i bought have been worth it.. glass polarized lense and really built well.

456885,Burtess,2010-04-16 22:06:00,901,"I have two pairs of Aviators, one made under Bausch & Lomb, one under Luxottica.  Both have been good. The B&L pair is at least 15 years old.  Nothing has broken.  Burt"
456886,MCTFisher9120,2010-04-16 22:16:00,3761,"I used my Ray Bans all summer, fall, and winter as well as the spring now and I have not had 1 problem with them. Hundreds of days fishing, cold, warm, rain or shine they have not been affected. Look at 95% of fishing pictures of mine and I'm wearing them. There great to have and a tool I have learned to use."
456912,HTHM,2010-04-16 23:36:00,4082,"Thanks for the commiseration guys, my bro-in-law is a pilot and he has has his for ~20 years with out a problem. That is why this is so frustrating for me. I do have a contact number for B & L now, so i will call them and see what can be done."
