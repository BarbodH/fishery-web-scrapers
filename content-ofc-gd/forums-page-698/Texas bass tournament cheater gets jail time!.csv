Turns out this bozo stuffed a one pound lead weight into his fish, which promptly sank to the bottom of the ""lunker tank"" where it lay on its side and was obviously having a hard time righting itself in the water. So the organizers scooped it out and found the weight.  You can read the newspaper story on it here.  Amazingly, he still swears he ""wasn't cheating"" when he stuffed the lead weight down his fish's gullet.  What a buffoon. They're going to love him in prison."
