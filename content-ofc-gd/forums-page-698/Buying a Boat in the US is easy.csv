456659,TroutnMuskieHunter,2010-04-16 11:04:00,1362, Thanks Paul...the seats have the guy's names on them but I don't think the boat will fit through the trails down to your Speckie Lake   .....maybe we can think of something else  Thanks for all the great replies!!
456693,Raf,2010-04-16 14:05:00,3495, thanks Gavin.
456698,cityfisher,2010-04-16 14:14:00,959,"Congrats ! I noticed the motor says SALTWATER, Does that mean its good in both salt and fresh water?  Sick boat !"
456760,Slop,2010-04-16 16:58:00,151,Very nice Steve!!....if ya see me out there in the Disco Lund c'mon out and lets see who's got the faster macheen!

456779,Spiel,2010-04-16 17:50:00,9065,"Zoom, Zoooooom."
456789,TroutnMuskieHunter,2010-04-16 18:26:00,1362," cityfisher, you can use the Saltwater for both salt and fresh water....there's a water hose connector just under the engine cowling so that you can connect a garden hose and flush the salt water out through the motor...not sure what the other differences are....possibly a few stainless internal parts..I haven't had a chance to start reading the owner's manual...    Thanks Grant!!....you're on Bud!!.....zoom zoom zoom    Thanks....no reports real soon as I still have to rig it up....I'll make another post later to pick everyone's brains as far as what's the best way to rig up rod holders..."
456876,Whitespinnerbait,2010-04-16 21:53:00,2038,   Nice comeback right there Steve.....
456435,TroutnMuskieHunter,2010-04-15 19:32:00,1362,"Just got back from my 1500km journey down to the States and brought my ""new"" ride home!!  I want to say thanks to all the guys that sent me replies to my earlier post regarding ""buying a boat in the US""....  http://www.ofncommunity.com/forums/index.php?showtopic=42536  I couldn't believe how easy it was was to get all the paperwork done at the border and get on my way....it took 14 minutes!!!  I'll definately will miss the pontoon boat and the 14' Smokercraft but only for a minute  ....I'm really looking forward now to start planning a few Lake O trips, Quinte trips and Muskie Hunts..."
456437,kickingfrog,2010-04-15 19:34:00,8333,Shotgun?
456439,BFSC Kevin,2010-04-15 19:36:00,1351,"Sweeet. Just wondering, what did you pay for the rig? How much was customs etc? I may want to go to the states to pick up a boat- much better selection and prices.  *also, was this a private deal or from a dealer? I assume from a dealer would be much easier and less agony(but more $$), since private listings may be a scam."
456441,Paully,2010-04-15 19:38:00,712,Sweet ride bud..  This might be a dumb question but i gotta ask.. Whats the difference with a saltwater engine??
456446,kickingfrog,2010-04-15 19:45:00,8333, NaCl  Seals maybe?
456450,corvette1,2010-04-15 19:54:00,1765,sweet ride congrats
456452,The Urban Fisherman,2010-04-15 19:55:00,2050,"awesome ride dude!  How shalow can you fish with one of those babies? Someday, when I upgrade I'd like to get something like this but I'm nervous about being able to fish some sloppy back bays that are only a foot deep..."
456455,lew,2010-04-15 20:11:00,12766,"WTG Steve & congrats, that's a great looking boat !!  Gonna be a big difference compared to fishing from the 'toon."
456464,TroutnMuskieHunter,2010-04-15 20:38:00,1362,  Definately private deal!!....customs charges are the GST/PST of the boat/motor and the trailer..
456465,Banger68,2010-04-15 20:39:00,157,Sharp rig. Enjoy!
456470,fishingisliving,2010-04-15 20:43:00,170,nice! you might notice a small increase in speed from your pontoon.....
456473,TroutnMuskieHunter,2010-04-15 20:46:00,1362," I'm not a ""sloppy back bay"" kinda guy so I won't be able to help ya out...    Thanks Lew!!!!....man I'm just itching to get out....I told the wife I may sleep in it tonight   ...she quickly told me otherwise after me being away for 2 days"
456474,Fang,2010-04-15 20:48:00,1330,any particular sites you used to find used fishing boats  good ones/bad ones?
456475,TC1OZ,2010-04-15 20:48:00,987,"Wow you could of told me that was brand spanking new, and I'd believe you!   I'm TOTALLY jealous! Beautiful boat.  If you want to head down to Erie to hit up the smallies this fall, please PM ME!  :D"
456480,Dondorfish,2010-04-15 21:03:00,1000,N-I-C-E!    But what can I say - its got my name written all over it!   Enjoy  Tracker ( Don )
456484,landry,2010-04-15 21:10:00,1005,"I just bought a practically new fish hawk in Iowa for a GREAT price. Second boat I have bought in the U.S. You will typically save about 3 grand on a boat that would cost you 10 - 17 grand here - if you take your time and hunt carefully. Always buy privately - pay cash - and have the boat compression and leak-down tested (lower unit check too). I typed in ""sitemash crestliner"" to find my fish hawk. It will direct you to a site called jaxed that will list all crestliner fish hawks (for example) for you in North America that are listed on Craigslist, ebay... the newest ones being listed on top. Check it daily and be ready to pounce. The border thing is a piece of cake. PM me if you need more info on the paperwork needed. You pay only PST, GST and 209$ trailer import/safety fee. I don't import the boat planning to flip them - I import boats I would be happy keeping forever, but when the dollar gets close to par it is a good time to shop down south. If you do flip it, it is possible to actually make money after you have used it for a couple of years (if all goes well). Landry"
456487,workwear,2010-04-15 21:20:00,592,congrads on your new ride........told ya it was easy at the border.....lol....now keep your tax bill reciept ...more than likely they will send you a follow up asking if you did in fact pay the taxes....cheeeeers to the new boat!!
456488,medmart,2010-04-15 21:21:00,587,Nice ride enjoy
456489,TroutnMuskieHunter,2010-04-15 21:26:00,1362," That was the main incentive Fil on top of getting around to ""hot"" spots quicker as well as venturing to new bodies of waters now ....    I think Landry is pretty acurate...just be patient and make sure you are GOOD AND READY to contact the seller and jump into you vehicle within hours to go get it!!!.....the old saying...""you snooze ya lose""  Here are few links:  http://newyork.craigslist.org/ http://www.iboats.com/used_boats/ http://www.boatsville.com/browse_used_boats.cfm"
456490,Raf,2010-04-15 21:26:00,3495, I'm curious as well.  Nice boat!!
456533,TroutnMuskieHunter,2010-04-15 22:50:00,1362, Thanks Peter...the border thing was a breeze!....
