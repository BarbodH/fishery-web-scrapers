456169,muskymatt,2010-04-15 01:56:00,2608,Sens win first playoff game ........whhhooohhhhooo  Anyone know the score of the leafs game? My guess is about 10 over par
456297,fish_fishburn,2010-04-15 13:34:00,1311,The Sens will be playing desperate hockey in this series for sure. They are still stinging what happened to them last time they met the Pens in the first round.
456321,JohnF,2010-04-15 14:13:00,3494,The Pens suffered thru about 50 mins of terminal stupid. Can you believe the dumb passes? Some of them weren't even passes. They just seemed to skate themselves off the puck. If they can set that aside and deliver a full game they should handle the Sens pretty easily.  JF
456342,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-04-15 15:17:00,0,"The sens are an under-rated team because they performed so poorly last season.  While Pittsburgh is still very top heavy with stars, Ottawa wins games based on depth.  Ottawa's 3 and 4th lines win games for them, and they just might win this series for them.  Go Sens Go!"
456349,Dutchy,2010-04-15 15:31:00,416,THe only chance the Sens have is if Pittsburgh continue to play the way they played last night. They were awful and still scored 4 times. Fleury was also crap.
