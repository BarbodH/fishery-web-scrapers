456318,fishermccann,2010-04-15 14:10:00,655,YES my mistake I have edited my post.
456445,Paully,2010-04-15 19:44:00,712, LOL..
456468,GBW,2010-04-15 20:40:00,8460,I sure am glad I didn't wear a speedo then skeeter now that I know you had a camera.  Can you see that?  Me with a float rod in a speedo with a fish on and you taking a pic?  DAUM!  I'm sure others would want that pic blured.  Even more so if you were in front of me!  HAHA
456469,GBW,2010-04-15 20:42:00,8460,"Oh and to the OP, it's just suckers in there now.  Either the fish (sucker) or you beinng the sucker trying to find a good fish and wasting that time and gas..."
453764,atvaholic,2010-04-09 04:15:00,271,Hi - Was thinking of hitting some of the lake O tribs this weekend..has there been enough rain to mess them up?
453765,young_one,2010-04-09 04:28:00,620,I would think all the creeks are blown at the moment. you can always check current level through internet. Real-Time Hydrometric Data
453869,sandmann,2010-04-09 16:17:00,51,Yesterday they were deffinately blown out.
453877,brifishrgy,2010-04-09 16:39:00,559,"  thanks for the link, I always wondered what that blue shed beside the creek was for"
453879,BITEME,2010-04-09 16:41:00,1968,Use your MARK180-Eyeball
453890,myot,2010-04-09 17:26:00,131,Will be fishable by this aft on some tribs
454041,vinnimon,2010-04-09 23:25:00,2593,"I passed by a few today and there still blown, but starting to draw back to norm."
454042,irishfield,2010-04-09 23:26:00,26272,Never know if you don't hit it and fish it..
454045,Sinker,2010-04-09 23:30:00,8692," Exactly!!  AND.......never take info from the net, as honest info. You'll never know if you don't go. Some of my best days fishing have been when nobody else is catching fish!!  S."
454086,vinnimon,2010-04-10 00:18:00,2593,"I keep this in mind always.When rivers are blown and muddy, the niagara is always good.Yesterday I was at the pool, it was at least 8 to 10 ft of visibility in most spots.And thats no bull.Chippewa crk 0 vis.The grand 0 vis."
454133,Spiel,2010-04-10 01:35:00,9065," Not always, if the rain that blows out the small rivers is driven by hard westerlies the Niagara will also get blown.   "
454168,MJL,2010-04-10 02:45:00,2427, But it's still fishable when you've got baseball sized roe bags and anaconda sized pinkies
454245,NoBoats_Onlyfloats,2010-04-10 13:15:00,13,Tribs were great on Friday aft....4 for 15ish got to the river at 530 pm had first by 6 then steady action till sundown...Fresh roe was the meal of choice yesterday!  ps for some reason I cannot upload their pictures...
454365,atvaholic,2010-04-10 18:46:00,271," I agree, but I live 2 hours away and hope someone could give some report on the water conditions. i think im going to try tommorow...was anyone out today?"
454409,irishfield,2010-04-10 21:35:00,26272,"That's the deal avt... there are some that will tell you it's blown, and if you went there you'd find them fishing it! I've never made a decission to fish a trib, or a lake, based on someone's ""catch"" report... EVER.."
454412,vinnimon,2010-04-10 21:46:00,2593,"I passed by red hill today.Unbeleivable.It was blown yesterday and today,perfect.As for bronte and all others"
454417,vinnimon,2010-04-10 21:56:00,2593,"True, but Ive seen it only once due to torential rain muddying upthe banks.Btw the current flow in the pool shifted.My fav spot to drift is backaswards."
454651,NoBoats_Onlyfloats,2010-04-11 14:30:00,13,
454859,eyeforelle,2010-04-12 01:30:00,38,"Hmmm, bet you there will be more hoards of people there tomorrow. next time, don't name tribs. this is why I dont fish the east ditches anymore  ."
454886,jon0gaona,2010-04-12 02:38:00,3, If you don't fish east tribs what do you care if whether or not he names the trib?
455009,fishermccann,2010-04-12 14:11:00,655,"There are not so many east tribs, that anyone who fishes out that way could not figure it out.Any true trib fisherperson has already been out for weeks, at the mouth, just waiting for the rest of the stream to open up. Good Luck Everyone."
456136,NoBoats_Onlyfloats,2010-04-15 01:06:00,13,Doesnt really matter if the tribs are named. Anyone with a 10th of a brain can find them...even less really. Should everyone be so secretive? Does this mean I need to blind fold freinds who've never been steelheading before on the way to the river. Reading all the posts about people askin if rivers are fishable/blown etc people lying and crap. If you need to be that secretive to catch these beauties then your doing something wrong. Just ask for tips .
456249,Paully,2010-04-15 11:04:00,712, I think you mean the following saturday..? no?..
456268,skeeter,2010-04-15 12:09:00,1907," Why is it that we have a hand full of 6 year old school girls posting on here? This is a fishing board. it is meant for people to post and show there fish. you refer to the hoards, that to me means you are referring to all the people here on OFC. do you really think that the hoards were there cause they read a post here on the OFC? if you people dont want to share the info, then why are you here? if you feel the need to photo shop out the back ground then why did you post in the first place?  if you dont want to share, THEN DONT POST...........  to those of you that do post, i thank you. as a result of them posting , i am going out fishing today with a fellow OFC member. and if i catch any thing I WILL POST IT. with pictures.  GROW UP or go find a secret board where there are no hoards!!!!"
456282,blaque,2010-04-15 12:57:00,2419,A true secret board would only have one member..............now thats deeeeeeeeeeep dude
