We headed to the south end of the lake which is called north Dalrymple. We found Northern pike, large mouth Bass and Perch no Crappie. Headed to the other end but fished the narrows on the way back suprized to find two other boats fishing.  We fished the south end until 1:00 pm with only 3 perch to show. We packed up and headed to Simcoe for perch, we took home 20 over 10 inches.  P.S. WATER TEMP ON DALRYMPLE 54 TO 56 F, we did find 49 dergees in the deep water of the south end. No Crappie found."
