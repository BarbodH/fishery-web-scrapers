456202,fishindude,2010-04-15 03:12:00,220," Funny you say that, I was told by the seller that I was second in line for it   lol. The people that sold it said that someone in town that lived close by to them ended up coming by to check it out to buy it. If only it were closer I would have picked it up asap...arghh"
456205,SRT8 smoker craft,2010-04-15 03:17:00,1107, Sorry dude add yourself to my friends list in my profile and I will try to remember to PM you if I decide to sell it

456386,bare foot wader,2010-04-15 16:52:00,1354,"if you're looking for a used boat/canoe there's plenty on kijiji and craigslist that go for cheap, just need to check regularly to get a steal of a deal...last fall I picked up a 13'6"" cadorette for 250, fished out of it all fall and then sold it in jan for 400....if you're willing to drive a bit there's lots in the kawartha/muskoka area"
456390,TC1OZ,2010-04-15 17:03:00,987,"DANG!!!!!! lol.  I'm always on Kijiji checking things out, haven't found anything promising..."

456499,fishindude,2010-04-15 21:46:00,220,"Trust me, I've been on kijiji and craigslist like a hawk. All the good deals that pop up are always at least an hours drive away, and I can't sacrifice missing school to go pick up a canoe. By the time I am able to pick it up, the boat is usually sold. Sucks donut..."
456505,Terry,2010-04-15 22:02:00,14456,man you need to set your priorities fishing first
455607,SRT8 smoker craft,2010-04-13 22:52:00,1107,Hey guys/gals I found a lightly used sports pal square back canoe for sale and was thinking about picking it up to resell if its worth while not looking to make much but I know people like these canoes and are lookin for them and I'm pretty sure I can give someone a good deal and still make a couple bucks in the end if your looking for one let me know
455619,solopaddler,2010-04-13 23:19:00,8605,Hard to say.  I know BillM has been searching for one since last fall with no luck.  He might be interested.
455622,irishfield,2010-04-13 23:24:00,26272,"I paid $500 for my, as new, 12 full transom last year.  "
455626,SRT8 smoker craft,2010-04-13 23:36:00,1107,pretty sure this ones bigger than that and has build in seats looks like it came that way but I'm not sure .
455628,irishfield,2010-04-13 23:42:00,26272,"Is it a full transom or a  square back? Square back come in 14 and i think 16'. Full transom in 12, 14 and 16.

455641,asdve23rveavwa,2010-04-14 00:20:00,2690,Now that was a steal!!!!!!!
455642,irishfield,2010-04-14 00:22:00,26272,Got it from an old friend.. it's probably 20 years old and never seen the water before I launched it!
455647,asdve23rveavwa,2010-04-14 00:25:00,2690,"Nice, let me know if you ever want to sell it!!  Used to have one without the square back...would still be nice to have for those places where you can't, or don't want to, put the boat in."
455649,irishfield,2010-04-14 00:27:00,26272,"My ""loader"" is built specific to it... don't see me parting with it while it's still in one piece!!"
455650,BillM,2010-04-14 00:28:00,17367,Definitely looking to pick one of these up..  Got some details?
455663,SRT8 smoker craft,2010-04-14 00:41:00,1107,Bill I will go get the details tomorrow and some pics.
455665,BillM,2010-04-14 00:47:00,17367,Thanks bud!
455670,fishindude,2010-04-14 01:03:00,220,In for details as well.  Cheers
455671,SRT8 smoker craft,2010-04-14 01:03:00,1107,  Thanks Irish
455714,rocket09,2010-04-14 02:35:00,18,"I know I am down the line a bit but I am also interested in this canoe if the others ahead of me don't want it, thanks chris."
455717,SRT8 smoker craft,2010-04-14 02:44:00,1107,Bill has first crack at it as he was first to show interest but if he doesn't end up buying it I will pm anyone who is next in line pretty sure it will be gone and Bill will be the proud owner.BTW I wish I could afford it but I can't so I will pass it on.
456038,SRT8 smoker craft,2010-04-14 21:54:00,1107,"so I went and looked at the canoe and it looks pretty good I think it might have a broken rib at the back and been a repair of some sort to the transom, its a square back not a full transom it's 14' with the foam seats from sports pal and comes with 4 paddles this thing hung in the garage and was barely used .      let me know if your still interested Bill and I will set it up."
456045,solopaddler,2010-04-14 22:02:00,8605,SRT8 you're a good man. Sounds as though you're being handed a gift Billy.
456049,irishfield,2010-04-14 22:13:00,26272,"And depending where this is going price wise.. and whom wants it.. put me in the buying line as well. I can wack 2 feet off it..put a new back in it and use it for the next customer that wants a canoe loader on their float plane.... or I may even use it myself, so I can fly one canoe in to a back lake and drop it and the passenger off... and then come home and get the other canoe and guest."
456069,solopaddler,2010-04-14 22:36:00,8605," Wayne, fyi, but if you just show up unannounced at the North Bay factory there's an excellent chance they'll sell you a factory blemished model at a huge discount. If you call them and ask they'll say they don't sell direct to the public. But both myself and my uncle bought one there at a very good price.  Just show up with a wad of cash in hand."
456091,pikehunter,2010-04-14 23:27:00,1659,"That'll do the trick, usually works How steady and seaworthy is it Wayne? Wouldn't mind something like that myself, 14 or a 16 though."
456100,irishfield,2010-04-14 23:46:00,26272,"Lloyd stands in the front and paddles..  That said.. when solo, they paddle like a brick! I have to row it. With two guys it's not so bad to paddle.. but definitely not like my wife's Scott."
456103,TC1OZ,2010-04-14 23:59:00,987,Any details on this yet? I have been looking for one since last summer as well!
456119,SRT8 smoker craft,2010-04-15 00:34:00,1107,here's some better pics I went and picked it up before it sold it's in better shape than I thought got it cleaned up and the transom looks like it was dropped and it dented it a bit I filled the back with water and it didn't leak still waiting to hear from bill .           Oh and sorry this is in general discussion admins.
456165,jediangler,2010-04-15 01:51:00,1923,"I sold my 14' transom model to OFC'er Frozen-Fire last year for $500 and it had quick release, swivelling, padded seats with backrests as well as drink holders."
