I think she was doing it on purpose because we were fishing out front of her cottage. Oh well she learned her lesson. We decided to switch over to practising for duck season, and pulled out a box of clays and the 12 guages.  JK of course, but the thought did cross minds."

456257,pikehunter,2010-04-15 11:23:00,1659, You did read it wrong Musky. There is no need to be calling people a moron or any other names either.  YES! WORK! The biggest enemy by far...followed by a lack of money.

456444,Jonny,2010-04-15 19:44:00,1380," It sounds like your frustration comes from fishing in a park. But that kind of a place is for everybody, so you need to get further afield.  Besides, if it's easy to get at it's probably fished too much anyway. Look for spots where you have to work to get at the water. Then you'll be fishing less-fished waters, and the dogs and kiddies will leave you alone."
456451,Mykester,2010-04-15 19:55:00,241," Yep, the problem is I don't have my G license, or a car. For now I generally fish at a local pond, it's nice but annoying when a random kids runs out of no where and throws a rock where you're fishing at. Luckily in the summer we spend a lot of time at Provincial Parks, and many of the areas don't have many people, plus we own a boat."
455687,Mykester,2010-04-14 01:49:00,241,"IMO it's either dogs or kids. Stupid dogs be swimming in the waters I be fishin'. Or stupid kids be throwin' rocks because ""hurr it splashes."" I mean if you're going to be taking your children out for a stroll by the local pond, atleast teach them some basic respect for the people around them (or keep a close eye on them). Kids + dogs = unfishable waters. This only applies to ignorant owners/parents, I've come across awesome dogs and calm children."
455701,DRIFTER_016,2010-04-14 02:10:00,10439,  I believe the fishermans worst enemy is:                                                                   WIND!!!!

455747,EC1,2010-04-14 04:33:00,930,"Nah Mykester, You can't blame anyone or anything, especially when they're all naive and not aware. I bet you've thrown rocks into the water plenty of times when you were young. Sure is a lot of fun when the fish were slowing down!  I say the worst enemy is a thunderstorm though..you can't even get on the water with that. All the other times, don't blame the fish, blame the yourself for not finding them"
455749,Syn,2010-04-14 04:40:00,519,"A negative attitude imo is a fisherman worst enemy. I cringe when I fish with someone who constantly whines,"" There's no fish here"" and halfheartedly casts expecting no bites and then gets a knot in his line and concludes that everything is working against him. oh boy what a downer.  Never seen a good fisherman with a negative attitude. I learned to always cast like you are expecting a bite and to be ready and alert for a bite. Positive attitude is key."
455750,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-04-14 04:56:00,0,"while it might be frustrating to have rock or dog activity close to where you are fishing, all things said, they have as much a right to use the water for their personal uses as you do.  by the same token, a person throwing sticks to their dog could state that your casting of lures makes it unsafe for their dog to swim.  we are all stakeholders and need to learn to live with each other (except for sea doo'ers, those guys are just plain arseholes)."
