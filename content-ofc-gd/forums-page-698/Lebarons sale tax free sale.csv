456525,darsky,2010-04-15 22:32:00,586,should this include Mtl store?

456531,bassman87,2010-04-15 22:48:00,586,"sweet, buy 2 packs of fishing line get a free nail clipper"
456535,Syn,2010-04-15 22:54:00,519," yeah lol. If they had the power pro for $13 no tax like the other fishing store, I'd be there for sure. Nail clipper/free hat no so much. Berkley giving away free bag with gulp purchase: probably to reduce leakage on the carpet  and consequential wife beating up husband."
456558,ADB,2010-04-16 00:16:00,444," Power Pro is on special already, I believe."

456637,young_one,2010-04-16 05:04:00,620,"must be our loonie setting at par with the US dollar, I was seriously considering visit my buddy in Buffalo and picking up some fishing gears, but now I feel like there is just one more reason for me to support Canadian companies now."
