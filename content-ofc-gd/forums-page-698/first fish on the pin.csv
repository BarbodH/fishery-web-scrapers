456624,spinnerdoc,2010-04-16 03:54:00,556,"second outing on the pin and managed these fingerlings...a sucker and a bow...the bow was acrobatic, multiple jumps and over all not a bad weekday outing. water was gin clear. casted to a spot and a steelhead jumped but missed my fly, saw a few more jumps but i could not get them to bite. switched up flies but to know avail.  stuck with the modified wallis cast  the whole time. few tangles here and there, but i was happy i didn't snap the line. i took mike's(MJL), about practicing a cast, if you feel that you are a bit tired casting, stop a while then get back to it. i still am not getting he distance and accuracy still needs work but i was able to get it more or less where i need the float to be....well there is always the next outing ....  here they are    and the mini bow "

456707,TC1OZ,2010-04-16 14:44:00,987,"I agree with everyone else, that's a sweet looking reel!  Beauty fish, even if they aren't the biggest!  I look forward to reading many more posts, keep em coming!"
456722,MJL,2010-04-16 15:24:00,2427,Dood that's awesome!   I was referring only to fly casting  You're not allowed to stop until you land a double digit steelhead on the pin   That reel was crafted by a hobbit artisans of middle earth and anodized in the fires of mount doom which is guarded by the dark and evil Lord Sauron.  It's called the And√∫ril centrepin...Able to demolish hoards of steelhead with the trot of its spool...In the wrong hands it's a weapon of mass destruction...That's what the Legends speak of
456811,spinnerdoc,2010-04-16 19:31:00,556,"thanks for the compliments on the reel.well that reel is the ""streamline""... at least that's what i call it, although MJL's sounds nice. it was my winter project. was a tank of a pin at first but with a few tips from paul at angling specialties,i was able to refine some of the rough edges.  Mike i am taking that double digit steelie seriusly..."
