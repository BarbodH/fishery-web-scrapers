455598,solopaddler,2010-04-13 22:23:00,8605," There's no heat on Stoty. Pretty sure everyone here likes the kid and wishes him the best!  As far the Sabres go, well I wouldn't bet against Ryan Miller in any series. He's the sole reason they're dangerous.  Roy and Fang, great pic's."
455620,lookinforwalleye,2010-04-13 23:20:00,4399," Hey Billy Boob sorry I mean Billy Bob, as long as Miller stands on his head the Sabres have a chance if Miller is average then the Sabre`s lose but hey your playing the Bruins and they suck too!  I think I might change my little picture thingy, not a lot of Habs fan`s here."

455640,Rizzo,2010-04-14 00:15:00,4754,"this was a real interesting read catching up on this post (hadn't checked in since yesterday). All the best to Stoty and I really don't think this should ""tarnish"" his memory of the day. We're not all going to have the same opinions of people, so go with your own gut and don't worry about what others say. Unfortunately (or maybe fortunately) not everyone gets an opportunity to meet the man face to face and see that ""he's a good guy"". The rest of us have to base our impressions on what we see and hear through the media.   I can tell you why I have no respect for him - it was the lying after being caught. To claim they didn't know what they were doing was wrong (snagging a fish and then throwing it back out to be reeled in again) is simply ludicrous when fishing is your living. I agree that we all make mistakes, but its how we deal with our errors that set us apart. You can continue down a dishonest path or you can step up, be a man, and tell the truth and accept the punishment. Its kind of like steroid users in baseball - we already forget about those who confessed, but the guys who tried to lie to cover it up are not easily forgiven."
455655,bigbuck,2010-04-14 00:34:00,2449,"Regardless of what Italo and Henry did in the past, they paid their price to society. That's it, done, over, move on!! Italo may sound condescending but you know what, the things he says actually sink in and register. He knows his stuff, I've talked to him a couple of times at the fishing shows and he is very insightful, helpful and takes the time to talk to you. Some of the other guys out there barely give you the time of day because of their inflated egos. I like Italo's show, unfortunately, I have to compete with the kids on Saturday mornings for the tv so I don't get to watch most of the shows on a regular basis."
455668,pikehunter,2010-04-14 00:56:00,1659, You did have a cool experience  and I appreciate your sharing of the great and memorable time that you had crappie fishing. Just block out the negativity and look forward to the next time you may have the good fortune to hook up with Italo.  Hopefully this thread will survive the bashing.
455673,Stoty,2010-04-14 01:11:00,2910,"Thanks to all of those who left positive feedback on this thread. Much appreciated!  Maybe all the negative people are leaf fans...if my team didnt make the playoffs for like the 500th time in a row, I'd be pretty ticked off too"

I had a horrible experience guiding a couple guys from another show on the Upper French a couple years back.   Absolutely horrible.  They were complete frauds and rip offs.    Italo had his problems but it sounds like he's legit.   Congrats.

455510,bigugli,2010-04-13 17:50:00,6138,"When my son was young, he idolized Italo. Probably because he was the only pro to actually take the lad seriously. He spent close to an hour talking fishing with the boy, despite the crowd at the fishing show. As for any wrongdoing. That was some 15 years back. The fines were paid, and so were the dues. He's human and as faulty as the rest of us mortals  Stoty, glad you had a couple of great days shooting episodes with the man."

455527,lookinforwalleye,2010-04-13 18:39:00,4399, Because we are miserable bastidges with nothing better to do and besides it makes us feel better about our own miserable lives. The above was for the rest of you guys I am perfectly happy and normal.LOL

455533,Fang,2010-04-13 18:52:00,1330,"Good on ya Stoty,  Amazing opportunity. These don't come along often so take advantage of them. No one has even picked up that you as one of the OFC community (one of our own) is doing a national TV show because of what they know not who they know.  Keep at it and keep your contacts up to date. I've met a few of these TV guys over the years, business and non business related. Some are great and some are a little rough  Italo and Henry did some in store seminar days back in the 80's at lebarons when I worked there. They seemed alright guys and were very friendly to me. They did what they were paid to do and that's push product. I don't have the same good experience with several of the top ontario bass pros of that time. When these guys came in the store for seminars of event days it was awful.  Here a shot from 2 years ago guiding on temagami. Neat couple of days and memories I'll not soon forget "

455330,ryansusanna,2010-04-13 03:01:00,27,"Hey Stoty, guess you met my friend Ryan today. i heard you weren't interested in the NYS smallmouth extravaganza tomorrow???? whats up with that.  to all the haters out there. the fishing show business caters mostly to those new to the sport. it is not a matter of talking down to everyone. it is a matter of explaining something so that someone with no base knowledge can follow along and learn!!!!"
455331,Cudz,2010-04-13 03:03:00,2652,"Nice work. From what I see, Italo appears to be a decent guy.  I don't think he means to talk down to people and I think people on this board might just be a bit sensitive.  Italo and Henry made a mistake and it seems some here can't forgive.  That is too bad.  I have been fishing for 30 years and I too have fished illegally before (obviously not anymore or even recently or even on purpose at times).  I guess those of you who have never ever, ever, done anything illegal while fishing before can sit on your pedestals and comment on others.  Some of us who might have fished with an illegal bait, or maybe thrown out one too many lines, or tried to catch an out of season fish, or maybe just netted a fish in a creek for fun should keep our mouthes shut.  Those living in glass houses should not throw stones. If it the case that Italo continues to use unlawful or unethical fishing methods and he has not learned from his mistakes, then I too would probably be casting stones.  Again, I don't know him I would just to give the guy the benefit of the doubt.  Hopefully he has cahnged. Keep up the good work Stoty.  I hope to see you on TV soon."
455333,Mykester,2010-04-13 03:04:00,241,"That's pretty awesome, I've only seen one episode and its with him kayak fishing and catching rainbows in central ontario. Always great to see shows filming areas not too far from home."
455358,Billy Bob,2010-04-13 11:01:00,5865,\ Sir: WELL SAID ! ! !
455362,cheaptackle,2010-04-13 11:18:00,849,"Looks like fun Stoty!  Is that US registration I see on one of the Jon Boats?  Just curious, not critizing.  And guys, maybe there's a side of the story not ever told like how (maybe) Italo & Hank might have been pressured by sponsors, producers etc. to get a show ""in the can"" so means not well thought out under pressure were resorted to.  Doesn't excuse the act, but one mistake provided it's not repeated shouldn't brand a man for life.  I too find that Italo may appear condescending but I dismiss that with the simple thought of his target audience (primarily newbies), especially when I see the clips of him working with kids (our planet's future!).  At any rate, for whatever reason the misdeed was committed, it was years ago, the price was paid, why keep beating on him?  If everyone one of us had to carry the burden of a mistake every minute of our lives, how would we feel?  I've made my mistakes and remember them, most importantly to LEARN from them in order to avoid ever doing it again.  I (amongst many I'm sure) would have given up on life a long time ago if I had to constantly relive in shame every error I ever made.  I hope y'all can forgive Italo as I and many others have forgiven myself.  Especially when the bashing is taking away from the obvious joy of a Fellow OFC'ers post about a day of fishing!  Michael"
455363,Lunatic,2010-04-13 11:19:00,536,"I remember when i was a kid maybe 12 - 14 i used to watch canadian sport fishing all the time,i couldnt get enough of that show and i remember always wanting a canadian sport fishing spring jacket. (i thought they looked cool) somewhere i got out of fishing and stopped watching the shows and have almost forgotten completely about that one altogether.  here we are years later and not even a week ago i came across Italo on youtube jigging for walleye in thunder bay i think. and after watching it i thought it was probably the most informative fishing video that i had seen in a long time. i dont watch these shows on tv because it seems to me more about hotdogging and screaming about all the huge fish they are catching one after another and less about technic etc. Italo explained exactly what he was doing and why he was doing it. I wish i had that info years ago when i first started fishing for walleye. I dont know him nor have i met him,but for people starting out i think he is a great place to start.  a funny note tho, my dad used to tell me i was wasting my time with fishing shows because they probably have some guy hooking fish under the boat for them, i guess he wasnt very wrong about it if what y'all say is true haha.  anyways to the OP, i hope you had fun,i know i would have loved to be in your shoes and probably would have learned alot."
455364,HTHM,2010-04-13 11:26:00,4082,"Or as Someone else said, ""let he who is without sin, cast the first stone"" Well said sir! I have yet to have a day where I have not made a mistkae."
455365,ehg,2010-04-13 11:42:00,2666,You will find your learning curve will go through the roof by fishing with Hodgey. Back in the late 90's i entered the CSF contests and Hodgey dominated in all species. Lots of good fishing still to be had

The point I wanted to get across is that this is an OFC'ers post about FISHING, not about ITALO BASHING.  Stoty was (as we ALL do) posting about fishing but yes with Italo.  I sure wouldn't want to have my memories of a great day fishing tarnished by all the bashing I'm reading.  If it's really necessary to dwell on what happened years ago, why not do it in another thread rather than dampen Stoty's experience?  I know I'd be feeling pretty low right now if this was happening to me!  Michael"

In Italos case it is unfortunately a case of him talking down to everyone.  He talks to everyone the same way including his wife who happens to be his usual co host.    Michael sorry but the first statement is preposterous.  The 2nd, well as mentioned he talks to everyone the same way including his wife."

YES if Italo has done something less than above board HE has to be accountable for his actions, as we all do. My son was happy to see the pics. We see enough bashing in politics on tv. That's why we spend more time on this site. To relax, learn and and share information with friends."
455168,Stoty,2010-04-12 22:25:00,2910,"We recently hit the water with Italo Labignon from Canadian Sportfishing to film the 2nd of a series of shows we’ll be filming in 2010.  The focus of the show was finessing Crappie on slip floats on Lake Scugog in Southern Ontario. We had been out pre-fishing for a few days, and the action had been amazing. We had followed a number of schools of great Crappie that moved into a few key staging areas….mostly due to the warm weather we had experienced so far this spring. Well, when it came time to do the show, the weather was -2 degrees and it was snowing. So, do we film the show or wait a few days for the weather to warm up? Nah, we filmed the show.well, with a lot of fine tuning and tweaking of our pattern we managed to get in a fun filled day with 50 to 100 Crappie and a few GREAT slabs.  The show was an amazing success and will air on TSN later this year; along with our 4 to 5 other shows.  Stay tuned for more updates as the year progresses… in the meantime, enjoy the pics.             "

455257,Ron,2010-04-13 00:44:00,1683," Ditto.   I will have to keep the rest my opinions to myself of Italo for the fear of permanently being banned from this site.  Good for you though Stoty, just be careful to not get too closely associated with him.  Cheers, Ron..."
455260,archie_james_c,2010-04-13 00:47:00,618,"Once again with Stoty's posts I see HIM out there, fishing, getting pics and producing, and a bunch of arm chair commando's with nothing positive to add...."
455265,lookinforwalleye,2010-04-13 00:51:00,4399,He does talk to people like they are infants probably why I don`t care for his show much and frankly I don`t know how he`s still on the air but good for you Jamie for getting some TV face time.  He sorta reminds me of Pee Wee Herman.
455267,solopaddler,2010-04-13 00:56:00,8605, I can't speak for anyone else but I've had first hand experience dealing with Italo.   That said maybe I shouldn't have made a negative remark.   I'm very happy for you Jaimie you seem like a good kid and it's a big feather in your cap.  I sincerely hope it all works out for you.
455270,Rizzo,2010-04-13 00:59:00,4754," ...you just made me snort coffee out my nose...and I'm not even drinking coffee! I'm not really sure in what way you meant this, but pretty sure pee wee did some activities of ill repute and he got a show again too! Amazing how some people get multiple kicks at the can and others can't catch a break. Might be one of those ""friends in high places"" scenarios?"
455272,Roy,2010-04-13 01:01:00,13728,I haven't any hard facts to back this up but I've always thought that threads head south either because of their content or because of the original poster. I guess I'll just have to keep learning.
455274,diggyj,2010-04-13 01:02:00,548,"That's awesome, Sweet!"
455281,T Fisher,2010-04-13 01:10:00,139,"They were White fish not Trout, sorry he deserves what he gets. Talks down to people is a understatement nuff said."
455282,brifishrgy,2010-04-13 01:13:00,559, sometimes its better to think stupid then to speak and erase all dought
