454613,Chris,2010-04-11 13:05:00,405,What a fight. Kudos to Edgar....might have been all about endurance and fatigue. It's one thing to upset with a lucky KO punch....but to win a decision over BJ....that says a lot.  Silva fight was a joke. I'll bet Dana is gonna be blogging on twitter.
454617,steverowbotham,2010-04-11 13:10:00,1800,Dana White is not happy with Anderson right now. Frankie Edgar fought an awesome fight.  I had said leading up to this that Edgar would be Penn's best challenger at 155 but I still thought Penn would take it.  Excellent job by Frankie!
454624,trevy727,2010-04-11 13:15:00,351,  Both those fights sucked. They were more boring than GSP's last fight. At least GSP threw Hardy down a bunch of times. Edgar and Silva did nothing. Niether of them deserved a win.

454642,Cudz,2010-04-11 14:16:00,2652,"Silva talked about Maia disrespecting him outside the ring and then anderson disrespect the whole sport inside the ring.  He is a counter striker and pretended it was Maia who would not engage.  It was easy to see who would not engage in the final 3 rounds. Edgar had a great gameplan and stuck to it. Be firts to the punch, hit and get out.  Lots of head movement and movement in general .  BJ showed no urgency until the last 10 seconds of the final round."

454679,Roy,2010-04-11 15:35:00,13728,I suppose that I can understand folks enjoying that stuff but I just have trouble seeing folks hit each other. Just me I guess.
454682,pike slayer,2010-04-11 15:46:00,1177,"i was impressed with frankie making it to the end and not to beat up at all. He had a good game plan to make it to the end and look good but he didnt finish the fight!! i say they need to find again and someone has to go down. after the edgar fight i left to go to the bar and missed the silva fight by the sounds of it i didnt miss to much! im gonna search around and see if i can find the fight online, by the sounds of things i expected better from anderson"
454749,SBCregal,2010-04-11 20:52:00,688,"The silva fight was ridiculous, so is having a champ that makes the sport look that way.  I left the place I was watching the fight in the middle of the third.  It was annoying to watch."
454758,Terry,2010-04-11 21:26:00,14456,silva sucked  first time I didn't enjoy the fights was these fights  and he wants to drop 15 more lbs and fight my boy George
454798,Gerritt,2010-04-11 23:30:00,6129,here is the fight in question..  Dana is one pissed of guy right now!  http://video.mmator.com/2010/04/anderson-silva-vs-demian-maia-ufc-112.html  Part 2 shows just what an ass he is..  G
454801,Jigger,2010-04-11 23:36:00,1237,Good for Frankie!!! I was out of my seat at the end. BJ looked to me like he was a little disinterested. The Silva fight pretty much went the way I thought it would. Boring.
