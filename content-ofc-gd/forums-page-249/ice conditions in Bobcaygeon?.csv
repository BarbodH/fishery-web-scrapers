If I lived closer to Bobcaygeon I'd swing by and take a look, but it is a little ways away. I saw that the lake ontario tribs are mostly thawed out and flowing now and that made me wonder about the channels. Thanks for any info fellas."
842891,Beans,2014-03-23 16:14:00,3339,The big river rarely freezes over for very long because of the strong current but the little Bob is still frozen...Nogies Creek is still frozen over also...Someone (Capt Pierre ?) reported the ice was 3 ft thick out from his place near the Little Bald Channel so it looks like a late ice-out this year...
842901,Locnar,2014-03-23 16:48:00,645,"Thanks alot Beans! A few buddies from work and I do an annual crappie/panfish day on little bob and I was trying to figure out when to go... and by the sounds, it won't be for a while haha."
842904,captpierre,2014-03-23 16:55:00,2521,"Ya, still severely iced up on the open lake.  Don't know about the channel  Gannon Narrows has been free of ice from just west of the bridge to a couple hundred metres east  Unless we get some serious heat soon, we'll  have ice still end of April, maybe May"

842941,captpierre,2014-03-23 19:42:00,2521,After a foul statement like that...go wash your mouth out with soap  Happy to do that if it would soften the water

843065,irishfield,2014-03-24 13:21:00,26272,Nope... but I did fly over it in both directions!
