Winter was pretty slow just about everywhere we went but the pure social atmosphere mixed with some surprise large catches now and then kept us coming back for more. Retired the ice gear last week and wet it again yesterday but NOW im determined , the short rods are stored and im ready for the open water showdown! Even if it means dipping floats in open patches for a few weeks. Lol"
843090,Old Ironmaker,2014-03-24 15:43:00,8243,Those are some very nice pics and pikes Rich. Crappie ain't bad either. Thankfully Haldimand Norfolk one if not the largest counties in Southern Ontario as lurkers try and guess where that ice is.
