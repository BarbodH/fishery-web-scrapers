842274,OhioFisherman,2014-03-20 15:21:00,6623,"Good article, as someone that fished regularly in tournaments here he is right about following the trail. Some lakes just regularly produce a better chance at a good sized bass than others. We have those lakes here too, plenty of bass, but ones over 3 - 3 1/2 pounds are a rarity, on other lakes a 5 pounder might not be a lock for big fish on tournament day."
