843222,bigcreekdad,2014-03-25 00:46:00,546,Any recommendations for an outpost for my son and I? Running water would be a must.  Thanks in advance.
843225,solopaddler,2014-03-25 00:53:00,8605,Plenty of recommendations!!  I'd be happy to help you if you contact me directly. (this is what I'm doing now  )  Need to know where you're coming from and how far you're willing to drive to the jump off point. Also budget and preferred species.  It's highly likely I can procure a better price for you as well as recommend a good lake. At the moment I'm working directly with over 80 outfitters all over the north.
843275,DanD,2014-03-25 11:21:00,2223,Oh yea. Let Mike help with this. He's pointed a number of us to a place that he's wrote a report on and I don't think there's one disappointed person that has gone there.  Dan.

Thanks Dan, but the reality is the vast majority of the outfitters I'm steering people towards have never been written about in a report."
843286,DanD,2014-03-25 12:07:00,2223,OK. Let me rephrase. If Mike says it's a good place; believe him!!!!!!  Dan.
