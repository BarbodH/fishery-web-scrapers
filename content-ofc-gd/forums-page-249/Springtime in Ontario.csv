Garry, my next door neighbor has a place in Yuma and has been there since last October and just got home last night. I was just talking to him a few minutes ago and think he's in shock right now after seeing all the snow we've still got."
842500,lookinforwalleye,2014-03-21 15:47:00,4399,"Ya I have a buddy that spends winter in Florida he came back a couple weeks ago, I phoned him the other day and he told me he`s back in Florida said call him when it warms up!!!"
842501,irishfield,2014-03-21 15:48:00,26272,"Well it ain't coming anytime too soon....  ... this mornings ""fun"". Figured I may as well enjoy the first windless day in 2 weeks before plowing it.  The ice shot is taken from the Cedar Point / Lighthouse Point Ferry towards Blue Mountain!.. Nottawasaga Bay locked TIGHT with 2+ feet of ice.  Think I'll head North next week... 3 feet of ice and travel to back lakes should be mint!"

842609,lew,2014-03-22 12:24:00,12766,"Around 5"" over my way and the blowers all gassed and ready to go.  Didn't start here till 4 AM and was over by 8 but it came down fast."
842618,Roe Bag,2014-03-22 14:32:00,246,No early Robins yet. That's my sign for spring A few Robins in my neck of the woods. Yesterday was a beautiful day here. (Port Dover/Simcoe area) Wife and I were out and about most of the day. Saw at least a half dozen in our travels.
842620,moxie,2014-03-22 14:47:00,1566,No early Robins yet. That's my sign for spring Saw a pair Friday evening gathering nesting material as the sun was setting. Regardless the weather spring is an eventuality. Has been every year since I can remember.
842621,bushart,2014-03-22 15:01:00,2628,local papers here are reporting sightings of waterfowl returning with little to no open water
842644,irishfield,2014-03-22 16:47:00,26272,"Fairly normal Terrance... Remember Lloyd and I ice fishing Lake Temagami in March of 2009 and being dive bombed by a nesting pair of gulls protecting their ""rock""... 38"" of ice !"
842645,lew,2014-03-22 17:01:00,12766,"I keep a couple bird feeders going all winter outside the front window and it's always nice to have a few dozen birds here all the time. Jays, chickadees, cardinals, finches, mourning doves, plus whoever else decides to drop in for dinner."

Jays, chickadees, cardinals, finches, mourning doves, plus whoever else decides to drop in for dinner. Like the deer, turkeys, rabbits. Tried feeding the rabbits here one winter, the owls and fox took care of that plan LOL."
842657,lew,2014-03-22 18:33:00,12766,"We have deer everywhere around here Cliff, infact there's 5 or 6 in the yard right now and usually a few turkeys too, but I NEVER see any rabbits so maybe your fox & owls came from this area LOL"

842440,lookinforwalleye,2014-03-21 01:53:00,4399,Seen a field full on turkeys today and a goose sitting on a nest!!!
842446,Whopper,2014-03-21 02:21:00,2174,"Snow here has finally melted including the parking lot piles. Ponds and small local lakes are open, things are looking better day by day but I have a feeling we will get hit with at least one more winter storm."
842460,wormdunker,2014-03-21 09:42:00,1711,"I'm in Niagara.  I was thinking of removing the winter tires - nope not yet!  I haven't seen a robin yet.  I'll be on Erie today fishing on 32""of ice chasing jumbo perch!!  Woo Hoo!"
842482,Big Cliff,2014-03-21 13:05:00,6899,"Had to drive up to Sudbury yesterday, wasn't so bad going up but coming back with white outs and all it sure didn't feel like spring! Looks like we are staying well below normal until at least the end of the month."

842495,Garry2Rs,2014-03-21 15:06:00,1425,"The temperature in Yuma has been in the mid-80's all month. That's 28-30 for you guys that aren't bi-lingual. Monday and Tuesday we will get a peek at Summer, when it goes over 90 for a couple of days.  I was in southern BC last week and they were having +10C during the day... I asked them to send some east to you folks. They indicated they'd take care of it, but you can't count on those west-coast hippies to follow through on anything.  If you can get rid of the snow, I will return the first week of May... If not, I will return anyway...HAHAHA. Garry2R's"
842496,Big Cliff,2014-03-21 15:11:00,6899,"Well, at this rate I wouldn't be surprised if we still have ice on the lakes when you do come back!"
