What I'm talking about specifically is the addition of lake whitefish and yellow perch, as well as largemouth bass. In all my years fishing this system, have i ever seen these fish in the system??? So why would they add limits? Also, we now have a closed bass season, which is okay by me, but i still find it odd because hardly anyone targets bass here from my experience. And the smallie population is INSANE! I wonder if the MNR has done studies and are actually seeing these fish in the system? I know for the first time ever we had an explosion of crappie last summer, which was pretty cool to see. Too small to keep so far but the kiddos like catching them. Anyhow, any thoughts or similar experience in different zones? Or different areas of zone 5?"
