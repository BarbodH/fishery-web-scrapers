842232,jedimaster,2014-03-20 13:31:00,3472,200 feet is a pretty good jump under ideal circumstances with a rally car and a launch ramp. To replicate that in a loaded up pickup truck and pressure crack is astounding.
842236,BillM,2014-03-20 13:45:00,17367,They must have been absolutely flying to go that far...   Unreal.
842244,grizzlybri,2014-03-20 14:03:00,565,"From what I read it was actually airborn for 200-300 feet before landing as per the quote below.  http://barrie.ctvnews.ca/investigators-learn-more-about-fatal-crash-on-lake-simcoe-1.1733536  “The vehicle was airborne for 200 to 300 feet and when it landed it rolled a couple of times,” says Brock Fire Chief Rick Harrison.

The reported said it Flew and Rolled 200-300 feet before coming to a rest.  Regardless how long it was in the air, as the saying go you can't fix stupid, anybody going that fast at this time of year on the ice, and with the way the weather has been lately. Well now its something the driver has to live with."
842245,jedimaster,2014-03-20 14:08:00,3472,"I could see 50 feet in the air at a good clip hitting a pressure crack then rolling for a couple hundred. I didn't watch the video, not unlike the media to mistype a story. You can fix stupid though. Unfortunately in this instance it wasn't stupid that got fixed."

The video shows the pressure crack the truck launched from and it's likely only 2 feet high at the most and maybe 10 feet long. If you compare that to the world record jump of 270 feet and the ramp required to clear that much air, you'll see that it's likely impossible for a pickup truck to hit a 2 foot ramp and be airborne for 2-300 feet.

I was at VB yesterday, and even some of the people going across to the island were just flying. Glare ice, with a bit of water on it. People just dont get it I guess.  S."

841702,Gallie,2014-03-17 11:45:00,1215,"Thats just terrible. It wouldnt be to hard to roll i was out there yesterday on my trike. The bare ice mixed with some small drifts means that if that the truck goes sideways and grips, its going over. My sympathy to the families."

841704,NAW,2014-03-17 12:15:00,4022,I am betting they where all un-buckled driving on the ice....  Horrible thing to hear about.  Condolences to the families and everyone involved.
841705,lew,2014-03-17 12:32:00,12766,Years ago my brother was snowmobiling across Scugog and when he hit a patch of clear ice he slid sideways then hit a pressure ridge and flipped his machine and was thrown off. Luckily he he wasn't going too fast and wasn't seriously injured.  I'd imagine it could happen just as easily with a truck if you were going fast enough.

With the right amount of speed you can flip a go cart on a flat surface. Believe me, I've had them up on two wheels a few times."

It really goes to show that ANYTHING can happen and it can happen in a heartbeat.  I've been one of the lucky ones, my number just wasn't up at that time but it can happen to any of us at any time no matter how invincible you might think you are!  I'll bet you anything the driver of that truck didn't go out there that day thinking that someone would die. My heart goes out to the families and all that were involved,"

Exact same thing happened to my buddy on a quad last year.  Smashed the helmet right off his head.  Serious concussion and whip lash... But he survived with no broken bones...

A few years ago we hit a drift, unmarked that was left by a hut that was moved, and were airborn on the sled for quite some time, and came down hard.  It cracked the front of the sled and I hurt my chin when my helmet hit.  Yup, it hurt, but definitely could have been worse (right Terry and Fidel)!!  I'm sure they were out fishing and having fun and tragedy struck.  Edit:  I would never wear a seatbelt while in a vehicle out on the ice either, for obvious reasons."

841779,Salmonidstalker,2014-03-17 22:43:00,265,"Never really understood the reasoning behind ripping it down frozen lakes, especially ones we'll travelled. With huts, pressure cracks,  drifts it's very dangerous.  The police indicated the vehicle rolled numerous times ejecting the occupants. They must have been doing at least 80 and probably more. Head shaker for sure."

841873,jedimaster,2014-03-18 18:21:00,3472,They are saying on the report 200-300 feet. I am amazed at 300 feet. I recall at the indy a hotwheel truck jumper 300 feet. it was doing 90mph as in 145 km/h and used a 16 foot tall take off ramp. If it in fact did fly 300 feet that is just astounding.

When they say 300 feet they're likely referring to the point where it became airborne to the point where it came to rest after rolling and sliding. Like the jumper, they'd need to be traveling very fast and have a purpose built ramp to be airborne for so long and there definitely wouldn't be any survivors.  It's unfortunate that 5 minds combined could not come to the conclusion that driving fast on unfamiliar ice might possibly be a bad idea."

Think about the speed and size of a ramp needed to propel a loaded vehicle the length of a football field. No need to sensationalize a tragedy like this."
