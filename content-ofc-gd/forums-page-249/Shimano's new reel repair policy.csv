However, recently I have been buying $40 and cheaper spinning reels because I can't justify the higher prices on a spinning reel. We will see how this works out for me. I figure if I get two tears out of a $30 reel then it makes sense. Today's $30 reels feel and run like yesterday's $100 reels. But how long will they last?"
841576,Steve,2014-03-16 17:22:00,2075,"generally, when turning a reel handle in the tackle shop, you cannot tell the quality of the reel....  the drag, the most important thing on a reel, cannot be tested....  nor can the reel be tested under load (which is one of the most important things with a reel)....  sub $100 dollar reels are made to feel good in the store....and they do."

I feel like he's a liar now for talking up shimano for so many years. He couldn't have liked the product that much if he left for the dollars.  About the reel policy - too bad but it doesn't change my opinion about the gear. Top notch. Not many people use the samegear for more than 3-5 years anyway.

I agree Dutch, I've been using Shimano gear for many years and if memory serves me correctly, the ONLY problem I've had was a Calcutta CT that stopped working and the boys in P'Boro fixed it up for me & cleaned it for a token fee of $5  As for the issue of no spare parts after 5 years, I can't comment because as stated above, my stuff never needs fixing."
841591,mike rousseau,2014-03-16 18:43:00,4661,I'm under the mindset you wanna buy products that don't need repairs....  In the last 10 years I've broke 1 rod... That's it... My fault... St croix replaced the $200 rod for $30...  I've only had 1 reel fail in 10 years... And that was user error....  I have lots of reels I've used hard for years with no issues...  I don't buy any high end stuff with the mindset that if it does fail I can just replace it...  Spinning reels I use are under $50 no problems...  And bait casters and line counters diawa have been great...
841631,MCTFisher9120,2014-03-16 21:18:00,3761,"Yes Shimano does there best to keep production going on reels that are discontinued but to me it makes sense. They keep stock on those parts and continue to make them for 5 full years after the reel is canned. I can only imagine the warehousing on screws, spools, bails, frames, etc if they still put the $$ into producing these parts in todays age. The nice thing is these older reels are tough and with regular maintenance they should last.  That $25 fee is 95% of the time all the customer pays plus the initial shipping depending if you shipped the reel to Peterborough or dropped it off. That $25 covers buddy's time to completely tear down your reel, re grease and oil all the bearings and parts as well as replacing basic parts in the reel. Like bearings, drag washers, etc…I had my Core 100MgFV send it. I paid $25 and they put in a entire new gear set into me reel both the Pinion an Drive gear for free as it was ""warranty"". I guess they were ""worn"" down. Something I was un-aware of but they took care of it. I can clean the reels myself but for $25 they do the work, spend the 20 minutes or half hour and replace all those bushings, springs and such for free.  Now. If you stepped on the reel and broke something that voids regular warranty than of course your going to have to pay to replace parts. If you consider the time and hassle $25 is squat. Let's not mention that that covers return shipping.  Don't hate too much. It kind of silly to expect a full stock on over 300 parts that can make up a reel. Especially when those shapes and sizes are not used in todays reels. I still send out old school reels. Some come back with a different handle, different bail but they do there best to fix up the old beast's and sometimes the reel comes back with no work done at all and a note saying no parts available to fix this reel.  What can you do. If you have a reel that is discontinued, call Shimano order the parts that are most likely to fail and hang onto your older reels as well as spare parts for them.  I love there service it's why I preach Shimano but the fact is they are the only brand with a proper warranty system and facility set up.  MTBF"

841637,John Bacon,2014-03-16 21:44:00,3277,"OK so someone has to play the devils advocate here....  How long would you expect a company to hold onto parts for an obsolete product? Should Ford still have shelves full of parts for a 1972 Pinto? We are always looking for improvements and new developments in our equipment and companies continue to do so, why would they hold onto an inferior product?  I see nothing wrong with their policy.  How about a 2002 or 2007 Ford F150.  The OP needed parts for a 12 year old reel; not 33 year old reel.  And parts could become unavailable in as little as five years if you bought in the final year of the model.  Something to think about before buying a Shimano Stella or Calcutta."

As far as I know they closed their Canadian customer service center. About 5 years ago I had a problem with an abu baitcaster. I managed to get a hold of someone and the problem was fixed. 2 years ago I broke the handle on a pflueger patriarch spinning reel. It was my fault and I tried to contact the manufacturer to get a new part. I could not get in touch with anyone. I like the fact that I can phone shimano in Canada and talk to them. The same thing with rapala. The ability to get in direct contact with the manufacturer and drive to a service center if need be is huge bonus to me."

My latest one is probably 10 years old by now.  The only problem I ever had with one was a roll pin that holds the spool sheared when hooking into a large slimey. Stopped in at a local shop (Sams Reel repair) and he fixed it right up. Nothing but good reviews from me.

Shimano should be careful though, they have a great following because of the service they have provided in the past. Businesses suffer when they lose sight of what got them to where they are."
842413,TrippyJai,2014-03-20 23:44:00,28,"When you pay more for a Stradic, you are not paying for longevity or repair-ability. You are paying because they use better material/bearings and the reels are more refined. If you need to send your reels to Shimano for repairs/cleaning. I think your better off buying cheaper reels which you can abuse for a few seasons and get the next model that comes out. A well maintained reel can last you literally forever.  I do minor maintenance on them during the season and they receive a complete break down at the end of the season. Shimano has always been good when I needed to order parts. Take the time to learn how to clean your own reels, plenty of information online and not hard to do at all.  I remember I paid $140 at Aikmans to clean 3 reels (1 spinning/2 bcs) and to install some bearings. Turn around time was 2-3 weeks. This was the first time I brought my reels for servicing.

607170,Garry2Rs,2011-07-28 14:17:00,1425,"This might have hit the board before, but it was news to me. Yesterday I dropped off a 12 year old Stradic to the reel repair depot at Shimano's head office in Peterborough.  The two young guys manning the shop were pleasant but told me they might not have parts for such an old reel.  It seems that Shimano's new policy, at least in Canada, is to only support reels for FIVE years after a model change.  After that, if the part you need is out of stock, you are out of luck!  In the past I have thought and said that it's very hard to choose between a $80.00 Sahara spinning reel and a $180.00 Stradic.  It's harder still between the $100.00 Symetre and the Stradic.  Because of the very fast technical trickle down, this years Symetre has all of the features that were introduced on the top-of-the-line reels only a couple of years ago.  The more expensive models have better bearings and more metal parts, but so what, if there are no replacement parts?!?!  Why not a new reel every few years?  By the time the carbon/plastic frame starts to stretch or the non-sealed bearings get gritty, you can toss it to the kid next door or straight into the trash and get a brand new one.  Since those better bearings, frames and metal parts might be smoother, but don't help your cast with spinning gear, in my opinion, the only excuses for paying a higher price was longevity and repair-ability.  In the past I though this worked for me.  However, since there is now a new model about every 3 years and the new five and out policy also comes with a second surprise, any repair will now cost $25.00 plus parts, Shimano has effectively removed the advantages that I saw in using their better spinning reels.  I don't say that I haven't had good service from my old Stradic.  It has only cost me about $15.00 a year to own so far and it might be another five or ten years before it needs parts again.  On the other hand , I might have bought my last Stradic and I now know that I will never consider buying a Stella or even a Sustain.  If you bought one of these high end beauties just before the new model hit, you might live through a $330.00 lose a few years down the road, but can you imagine the heart-shock of finding out you have a five year old $900.00 paper weight?!?!

607197,Rodwrap,2011-07-28 15:04:00,130,FWIW....  This place in Texas specializes in repairing & customizing Shimano reels. I've heard a LOT of praise for them....    http://www.lakeforktacklerepair.com/
607203,GBW,2011-07-28 15:14:00,8460,That sucks.  I know that the industry standard in the IT world was that 'you have to have parts for 7 years after that unit goes end of life and becomes another model'.  I'm a bit shocked that Shimano would only do 5 years.  And with the amount they sell they probably will have parts for many years but they are covering their    with that statement.
607204,jedimaster,2011-07-28 15:17:00,3472,Shimano has been losing money and with new leadership the accounting side is taking over much of the fishermen friendly side of the company.

These are the reasons why Warranties arent what they used to be because of false claims and people wanting hand outs for something that was general wear and tear or operator error"

If they could make a car that lasted 50 years we would want a new one after 5 anyways because of the heavy marketing campaigns they have for everything nowadays.  It is all about cyclical consumption in a throw away society.  In order for you to want to throw your stuff out and buy new stuff they have to make you believe that the new stuff is so much better. That is why they have these stupid ICast's every year so the same old talking heads and shills can convince you to buy all this 'cutting edge' equipment, while the whole time sneaking around the show trying to get a better sponsorship deal with a another tackle company so they can convince all their fans that they should in fact buy 'this' product line instead of the other one they have been shilling for years while preaching about 'credibility'.

607359,Garry2Rs,2011-07-28 22:27:00,1425,"  Your point is good, but let's face it we aren't talking Pinto's here.  We are talking Lincoln's!  I would never disagree that I have had my good and fair use out of my old Stradic 1000FG with the white finish and the wooden handles...grin.  The good news is that yesterday they still had two of the broken anti-reverse parts in stock, so mine will be repaired this time.  My point is that next time, there won't be a part available, so a very good reel will have to be retired.  The current non-plastic model Stradic is the FJ.  There have been 3 new model since 2000 when I bought my FG.  The improvements include a slower oscillation for better line lay, an improved drag, a tapered line roller that might be better, an oil port on the side cover that strikes me a odd because the worm gear, that it gives you access to, is a part that is normally greased...There is also a new profile on the spool lip, which is supposed to add casting distance, but that I think just causes braid to fall off the spool more easily.  There are new gears too, but the old ones are still pretty smooth to me.  The wooden handle is nice and I have never had dog hair cause the handle to bind on the old reel, but it does on my rubber handled MgFg.  The biggest change over the years is that they shrunk the frame so that the 1000 spool is now on a 750 size frame.  The smaller frame saves a little weight, but since it is in your hand, I don't really notice the difference in real life.  Shimano was one of the first manufactures to have a reel positioned at every ten or fifteen dollar price point.  Today they show 20 different spinning reels on their web site.  Then they say there are too many parts...Go figure!!!  Wake up Shimano...This is a self inflicted wound! Garry2R's"
607404,canadadude,2011-07-28 23:58:00,769,"I have 2 of those old Stradics, after getting new anti reverse fixed twice in each reel, I retired both of those old clunkers. It dosn't suprise me all the spare parts are used up, the best and only decent thing about that junk is the wood handle.I still have them and yes, the anti reverse is shot in both reels"
607610,monsterfish,2011-07-29 14:36:00,48,Shimano has always been good to me and whenever possible I will continue to choose Shimano over the competitor.  And yes I have had trouble finding parts for my 72 pinto!  Keep your hooks sharp!
607698,craigdritchie,2011-07-29 18:14:00,1586,"Garry - you might consider hunting around on eBay for parts, or just buy another cheap reel you can strip parts from. Just a thought."
607821,2jack2,2011-07-30 02:59:00,92,"With the average shelf life of the reel is 3 years, parts are available for 5 years after the reels discontinued, that means the parts is actually available for 8 years, and no matter you buy a $50 reel or $800 reel, they all only come with 1 year warranty, so they didn't make customer think the expensive reel will last any longer. The average life of the reel is 5 years, if someone only fish 5-6 times a year and he owns a Stradic, the reel will properly last 30 years, on the other hand, someone fish 200 days a year, the same Stradic may only last 3 years, think about this way, if I spent $200 on a Stradic and  I fish 30 days a year, after 5 years is 150 days of fishing, it equal to $1.33 per fishing day which cost less than a doz of worm.  Now look at the production side, When manufacture create the tooling to make a reel, they make a percentage of extra parts for repair service, once these parts run out, you are out of luck. The tooling do not last forever, after the production is finish, the tooling may be worn and will not cut the part properly, to make new tooling will cost hundreds of thousand dollars, not economically just to try to keep a $3.00 parts in-stock. The money will be use to make new tooling for new reel, which will fill the demands of consumer who always wants to have the newest, most advance design and cutting edge products.  There is no money to only manufacture parts for repair for non-current product, not in the reel business or any other business, manufacture or any aftermarket company. Here is how most reel repair shop work, someone bring in a old reel for repair, parts no longer available, the customer feels there is no need to keep the reel, they left it at the repair shop, now, suddenly, some of the parts from this reel become available to the next customer who happens looking for the parts, you never know, may be 2 months down the road and you go back to Shimano, they may have the parts just because someone drop off some old reels there.  Shimano service is very good, as long as they have the parts; they will fix the reel for you no matter how old the reel is, with a small charge which is understandable. There are lots of other reel companys out there selling high end reel with no parts available at all, they only give replacement reel within the 1 year warranty, you get a NEW REEL if it broke within the first year, after 1 year, no more service."

I went to buy a couple new reels a few years ago, and noticed they where still selling the same diAwa line of 1300/700's and I compared the features to the newest models, realized they weren't as up to date, then realized that the diawas may be old technology, but were bullet proof and had served me very well, so I walked out with a couple more 1300's..... lol, i expect my kids will be fishing with them!
