842710,moxie,2014-03-22 23:34:00,1566,Guess everyone missed my point. They advertise it like it's the end of days and it just isn't. Hype. All filler and hype.

There was a chance of freezing rain, they issued their warning, it didn't happen.  Seems like they did their job just fine, but maybe that's just me."

The only good news is no matter how much we get it seems to be able to melt off within a week. Vary rarely do we have long spells of white stuff on the ground.   Art.

We only got 5"" over here but it's about 4 degrees right now so it's really heavy, but the good thing is it's melting too. I've got a gravel driveway and cleared it a couple hours ago and most of it is bare now.  Big Cliff is over on Sturgeon and he said they got 6-8"" so you should be somewhere in between."
842653,Big Cliff,2014-03-22 18:14:00,6899,Got out and cleared mine before it got too warm so it was still nice and light. Then the wind came up and drifted a lot of it back in. It has warmed up enough now that it isn't drifting any more and things are starting to melt again. I sure hope this is the last of it though!
