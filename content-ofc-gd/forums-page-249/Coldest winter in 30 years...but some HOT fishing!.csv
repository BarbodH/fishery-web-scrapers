842329,RJackson,2014-03-20 18:01:00,113,"Yuuuuup, a fishing report!  The coldest winter to hit Eastern Ontario in over 30 years, ya it sucked.   We had ice early and it never left so that was the silver lining.  Was it a challenge at times?  Darn right but we made the best of it.The usual suspects came topside this past winter with a few new things thrown in the mix to keep it interesting.  The Crappie bite was great early on probably stayed steady but other species pulled us away from that bite.  Having Chevy at the house led to a few impromptu texts.  “We fishin tonight?”  Often it was yes even if we only snuck out for a few hours.  Paydirt was usually found.So close to 15…I swear that is the toughest fish to catch around here, a true 15 inch Crappie.Only did Quinte once this year.  After the day we had I didn’t really want or need to go back…..when ya whack nearly 30 walleye in a day it’s tough to compare to….Full report on this wild day is here: http://www.rjnbirdeesoutdooradventures.ca/?p=1357Probably my favourite fish I landed this winter was this sucka.  Most people scoff at Panfish but until you target them regularly you don’t get an appreciation for a fish like this.  It fell just shy of the Ontario record but is still headed for my wall.  Highlight day was one spent with our friends Darren and Sherry up in the Hills.  It’s a privately run area with their own stocking program so don’t be thinking this is a MNR stocked lake situation.  Though it does shed some light in my eyes as to what those lakes could potentially produce.  Incredible day of Rainbow fishing, just incredible.Loads more pics from this day are in this report: http://www.rjnbirdeesoutdooradventures.ca/?p=1365Spent two nights on the Ling…man they’re fun.Lakers are always on my mind, whether on ice or the Lund I just love those big headshakes.  A truly majestic old fish that should be treasured in our area.  Haven’t spent many days out on the chase but some quality fish have visited the topside for a few seconds…More Laker Pics can be seen here: http://www.rjnbirdeesoutdooradventures.ca/?p=1392File this one under the “It makes no sense” file…..while Crappie fishing I landed this….Then while Laker fishing I landed this on a swimbait….Bizarre but fun nonetheless.Spring is here they say, I see at least 3 more weeks of safe ice fishing.  Pick your spots, stay away from current and have a blast in the sunshine as the weather finally warms…..RJ"

842332,Steve,2014-03-20 18:19:00,2075,"Rob, there isn't an angler in this province who can go from the boat/open water to the ice as successfully as you.  Can't wait to see your early season open water adventures....  Browns with your glow frog cleo should be up next"
842340,chris.brock,2014-03-20 18:42:00,4053,"Looks like a successful winter despite the weather  For the private lake rainbows, I'm assuming it's a catch and release lake?  I wish there was some public catch and release lakes around"

842528,Joeytier,2014-03-21 18:17:00,3990,"Quite the season you had...great pics to boot.  As for the MNR-stocked rainbow lakes, there is great potential for fish up to and even much larger than those big guys!"
842544,RJackson,2014-03-21 20:12:00,113,"Thanks folks!  Glad you enjoyed it.  It was a weird winter but if ya put enough time in things can happen every now and then.   Looks like a successful winter despite the weather  For the private lake rainbows, I'm assuming it's a catch and release lake?  I wish there was some public catch and release lakes around  No hard and fast rules on C&R but as far as I know unless they're deep hooked they go back.   Quite the season you had...great pics to boot. As for the MNR-stocked rainbow lakes, there is great potential for fish up to and even much larger than those big guys!  Not around here for some reason.  The odd fluke but our stocked lakes in Eastern Ontario are lacking in many ways.  RJ"
