He might even invite me, who knows?  I was wondering if any of you have fished it and I'd appreciate any insight or knowledge you may know of Whitestone Lake that you would like to share. It's located near the town of Dunchurch, Ontario. Not looking for specifics just a general where to start and for what species at that time of year. Anyone willing to give some more specific info that would be greatly appreciated through PM message.  Thanks guys."

I have heard the fishing is not bad and there is a good population of crappies in there so I have been told . I do know that there is a small bait shop right in Dunchurch that will probably give you some good info.
