842918,Musky or Specks,2014-03-23 17:49:00,2710,Not to buggy on May 31st is a tall order. I'd try Martin Camp in Restoule. North Bay is close(Fannies) plus great fishing and hiking in the area

843041,Old Ironmaker,2014-03-24 09:43:00,8243,"Shloim,  Budget, that's probably the most important thing you didn't mention. You may have a beer budget and someone recommends a good Champagne. The other thing is what is your definition of amenity? I think luxury at a fishing camp is an indoor toilet, my wife's definition is it's a necessity. Shower, now that's a luxury, she begs to differ.  I always tell everyone asking me a question that I have problem getting, you have to remember the W5 formula. Who? What? When? Where? And why? Now ask the W5 and that's a good question. How included and you get the best answers.  Let us know the above and you will get some great recommendations here. Total of thousands of years experience at your disposal."
