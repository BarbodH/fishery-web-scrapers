841395,DRIFTER_016,2014-03-15 16:08:00,10439,Been down here for a couple of weeks and have caught a bunch of fish but haven't taken any pictures until today. Took one of the Pompano I brought home for tonight's dinner.  
841416,mr blizzard,2014-03-15 19:21:00,1589,"Beautiful fish, get the beer batter ready,  bring on some more pics"
841417,misfish,2014-03-15 19:27:00,29133,Whats the meat like Dave?  Nice looking fish.
841447,DRIFTER_016,2014-03-15 22:58:00,10439,Meat is light and white. Pretty tasty too. BBQ'd and served with beans and mac/cheese.    
841450,misfish,2014-03-15 23:04:00,29133,"I just ate a nice fresh white fish and fries, That just made me hungry again. You can go wrong with fish from the sea."
841457,Christopheraaron,2014-03-15 23:23:00,3525,"Pompano are cool fish, how do they fight?"
841459,NANUK,2014-03-15 23:25:00,797,"AKA Pomfret, one of the best tasting salt water fish IMO, no scales to clean, just remove guts, score the skin a few places, rub with your favorite spices, garlic & lime juice, shallow fry and serve hot with home made salsa & chips"
841470,DRIFTER_016,2014-03-16 00:01:00,10439,"Pompano are cool fish, how do they fight?  Like a really big sunfish!!!"
841744,esoxansteel,2014-03-17 18:58:00,1307,"Went a little lite on the spice there Dave LOL,    baked beans, mac and cheese, and lots of spice, spells gassy methane mushroom cloud"
841745,BillM,2014-03-17 19:03:00,17367,"My oldman loves eating those things.... and whitings and mackerel, and everything else."
841768,spinnerdoc,2014-03-17 21:20:00,556,"The meat on those fish are awesome. We eat em a lot at home. Steamed with onions, tomato,  salt and pepper is another way of cooking it. They are great on the BBQ."
841842,The Urban Fisherman,2014-03-18 13:30:00,2050,Sweet - I love freshwater fishing but you can't argue that saltwater fish out-fight freshwater fish 10-1!  They taste pretty awesome to!
842105,DRIFTER_016,2014-03-19 22:05:00,10439,"Got out in the Yak for  few hours with my buddy Brian this morning. The paddling was good, weather was awesome and a few reds were caught.        "

842243,DRIFTER_016,2014-03-20 14:03:00,10439,"awesome stuff .... that bbq picture really makes you hungry  once you get back up north will you be starting work on the cabin ?  Yeah, that's the plan. Move supplies to the site before ice out. Don't know what I'll get done this year. Starting with the dock and then hopefully the foundation. Depends how much $$$$ I go through."
