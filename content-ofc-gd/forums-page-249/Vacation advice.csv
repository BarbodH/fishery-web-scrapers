842152,HTHM,2014-03-20 00:37:00,4082,"I am looking for a place to stay for a weekend, (arrive friday- leave Sunday), for a small family gathering. Just seven siblings and spouses for a total of 14 people ranging in age from early 50's the early 60's. We need to have a communal dining area, on the water, and nice amenities. We are looking at a mid Sept to mid October time frame. Anywhere within a 4 hour radius of Hamilton would be welcome on either side of the border. Thanks in advance for any advice."

842199,adempsey,2014-03-20 04:14:00,1498,"What's your budget?   There are some really nice private cottages that can accommodate that sized group, but some of them are pricey!  http://www.kawartha-luxury-properties.com/properties/bigbear/  The largest I've seen at all the places I've been to sleeps 10.     Personally, I'd just rent a couple side by side and simply eat together in one of them.  Elmhirst Resort on Rice Lake has some nice cottages.   They also have two pools (1 outdoor and 1 indoor) and two restaurants.  Also a nice wine cellar.  The biggest cottages sleep only 10 though."
842267,HTHM,2014-03-20 15:08:00,4082,Our budget is ~$1600 for the weekend. BIg bear does not rent by the weekend. That place would have fit the bill very well.
