If you haven't seen one, it's a pole that descends vertically from the boat to hold it in position while you cast, sort of like a high-tech version of shoving the paddle down to bottom. They're mainly for keeping the boat from moving in the breeze while fishing shallow water, and they work really well.  Anyway, Minn Kota has launched a new website to show how tough this thing is, with movies of it being ""torture tested"" by being subjected to flamethrowers, shotgun blasts, being dragged behind a truck, beat on by a cage fighter and tossed around by a Scottish highlander. If nothing else, it's pretty entertaining stuff.  Click here to have a peek.  "
