842462,Old Ironmaker,2014-03-21 10:16:00,8243,"Good morning all. Looking at spending 3 or 4 days and nights in May on LSC after opening of Walleye. If the ice is out. I have been a few times at a freinds on the US side. Near the Air Force base, like an air show everyday. Didn't fish from his Pete Fountain go fast boat, couldn't troll at 100 mph. Wow what a rig. Met his neighbour (drop name here) some guy named Kid Rock, the Kid, who I actually heard of, loves Walleye fishing and that's the main reason he bought there. We talked big Walleye from Erie and Bay of Quinte. Nice neighborhood to say the least. Not the Muskokas but it sure is a nice area where they live.  There will be 3 or if we take the second boat 4 or 5 of us. Featherstone Ted has fished the lake but it's been a few years. And I have read here about spring success on the lake, thanks all.  I'm looking for a camp, cabin or cottage that we can rent mid week in May. I will check the regs for opening, limits and slot sizes etc. I've stopped at the park under the Blue Water bridge to the US at Sarnia as well as the area on the Port Huron side. Cold beer and sliders go good after that ride in the fog on the 402. Both sides the water was crystal clear and smallies and Walleye could be seen meandering around the rip rap on both sides. So somewhere on the south end of lake might be good. I really want to fish that river but only got 1 vote. Doesn't really look like anything other than motels along the river in Sarnia. There have been a few shows showing them pull them out below the bridge. Is there a Casino in Sarnia or am I getting Windsor and Sarnia mixed up? They  were hauling out them from in front of the casino. A very light colored pickerel. I don't see them encouraging frying fillets in the rooms in the casino. If you lose enough they'll let you cook anything in there, or win hoping to keep you for a few more days.  Can anyone give me some links to cottage's or cabins somewhere on our side of the lake. Doesn't have to be a fancy place. Clean is always good. Has a BBQ and we are good to go.  Thanks in advance all.  Johnny D Selkirk ON."

842472,Old Ironmaker,2014-03-21 11:40:00,8243,"hi do you want to fish u.s. or canadien waters. seasons open year round in ont. limits 6 fish.. in may I would be jigging Detroit river.  Thanks outlaw good to know, was just going to download the PDF regs for the river and the lake for 2014. I would fish both sides, will need a Michigan permit. If someone comes in my boat they will get a Michigan permit as well. Just stupidity to fish without one. I found the Wardens and CO'S on border waters really don't mess around. We have fished the lower Niagara and the upper back when you could fish both sides of you had an Ontario permit and left from Ontario. If you actually left the dock from NY then you needed a NY license if I remember right.  I have read here as well as elsewhere the Michigan guys can be very tough. Let's not take this thread in that direction, yet, yea after I've said my 2 cents worth."

842576,Gerritt,2014-03-22 00:25:00,6129,Not sure if I have my logistics correct.... But I remember a camp in sombre? I seem to remember it being south of sarnia.. I am going back a bunch of years to my youth when my dad was working out that way and we stayed at a camp.... It was the first time I had seen folks fishing for sheepshead and keeping them for the table....  G.
842577,Gerritt,2014-03-22 00:25:00,6129,Or maybe it was wallasburg.... ??
842815,Old Ironmaker,2014-03-23 04:00:00,8243,"Thanks all. Looks like it will be the 3 of us. So since I only get 1 vote and it's my truck pulling my boat my vote is the only vote  that counts. So the Detroit River it will be. A nice motel is cheap in Windsor, can get a 2 bedroom suite for 100 beans. Same room in TO or the Falls would be well over $300.00. Probably closer to $400.00. 2 queens for around 60 in a highly rated motel. Now I wonder who gets to spoon whom. Groundy is too short and Ted too fat. I see a cot in someone's future.  The trick is hitting the Walleye run with the cold water temps that will effect the spawn for sure."

842889,outllaw,2014-03-23 16:05:00,1232,"bring some 1/2 and 3/4 jigs. finnese minnows. you will do well on eyes,and outs season smallies/muskys and the occasional 6ft sturgeon.. from the boat ramp your fishing within 100yards. the marina is 3kliks from my shop and home. im spoiled lol."

843043,Handlebarz,2014-03-24 10:15:00,3790,Your best bet is Windsor that time of year as said above. Look at anglers choice for your jigging minnow baits Dave has many custom colours for the Detroit river or st.clair river. You will need some funky colours natural colours and a bunch of different colours heads in the weights outlaw said. You should also get his small worms for jigging as some days that is all them eyes want.

Man that is very helpful, thank you, thank you. Yes you are spoiled. We live right on Erie just east of Nanticoke. Watch the Smallies, Gar Pike and can walk across the carp having group sex from the deck. It's nice being spoiled outlaw. I Your best bet is Windsor that time of year as said above.

I didn't expect any tips but sure aren't going to ignore them. Would you please PM me with your charter rates for the Musky season. I have shown a few from my crew a few of your reports and pics of the new mount and are very interested."

843219,jackal68,2014-03-25 00:33:00,68,check Mitchell's  bay
843230,Whopper,2014-03-25 01:06:00,2174,That's funny right there Mr Parker I could spend an afternoon in George's shop drinking coffee and listening to him talk fishing and lure making.  Sorry to hijack this thread
843294,mistaredone,2014-03-25 12:28:00,913,"Mitchells  bay has a nice motel that's attached to a diner.  The room I had had like 6 single bunks in it, perfect for groups of hunters and fisherman.  Problem with Mitchells is getting out of the bay is a long and slow ride."
843307,outllaw,2014-03-25 13:41:00,1232,"im not that old. I did see turtles before,they had shells though.. I will say you will have action. under 59 degrees use finesseminners. over 59 Wyandotte worms are hot.... this years spawn will be a late re-coup. st clairs still ice covered. a first in 50 years.. but last weekend she ate a few sno-machines."
