842275,jimmer,2014-03-20 15:22:00,2730,"Sorry to hear you and the family are going through some sad days. She looks so much like one of the huskies I had. Ours made it to 16, same leg problems, but wandered off when it was her time. Sounds like you have some amazing memories though!"
842298,mattybculp,2014-03-20 16:30:00,388,"Man it brought me to tears reading this thread, I have had to put down a couple of my pups over the years, and its the hardest thing I've had to do. When we knew it was time for our 12year old lab to go down I was able to find a vet here in Peterborough who would come to the house to do it. I layed a blanket out in the back yard sun was shining  I got him to lay down on his favorite blanket and laid beside him and looked into his eyes until he was gone, I didn't want him to go in a strange environment but at home with us, and then as a last sign of respect I carried his body to the vets vehicle. It was tough on us but I thought it was only fair as he was my loyal friend, sure it cost a little more but was worth it to me. Resting your head on the pillow at night, know you loved her as much as possible and think about the great life you gave her. I feel for you !"
842399,bigbuck,2014-03-20 23:08:00,2449,There's a lot of good memories there with your pal. Sorry for your loss.
842405,manitoubass2,2014-03-20 23:25:00,11391,"Never followed through today. She had a real goodnight indoors. One more appointment for her tomorrow just to get a second opinion. Kids are devastated at the though, so we might keep her around a few more weeks if the vet says that wouldbe okay"
842431,NANUK,2014-03-21 01:28:00,797,"So sorry to hear, always very tough to say goodbye to your best friend."

I had her do a 19 x 24 pastel picture of my dog a couple years ago and couldn't believe how nice it turned out.  I haven't seen her post here in a long time and don't even know if she's still around or can be contacted, but just thought some of you dog lovers may be interested.  Just another nice way to remember your friend.  "

She was a wonderful friend, but her health was failing and she was suffering. I still think about her and our other dogs often. Better to think of the wonderful 14 years you had together. You have my heartfelt sympathies."
