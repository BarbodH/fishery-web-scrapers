842250,redpearl99,2014-03-20 14:38:00,259,"With the weather warming up in the up coming days, I'm just wondering if it's going to be too warm to ice fish safely but too cold to go steelheading.   It would suck if I can't go ice fishing but also can't head to the rivers because the ice hasn't melted yet."
842255,BillM,2014-03-20 14:51:00,17367,Ice on Simcoe is not melting anytime soon.  A few rivers will be fishable... like... 2?  lol
842268,porkpie,2014-03-20 15:09:00,2521,"I'm sick of winter, so I've been steelheading.  Conditions are less than ideal, but I can't stand the thought of more ice fishing right now.  I was out in my street tossing a practice plug on one of my casting rods this morning. The neighbours think I'm nuts, lol!"
842273,NAW,2014-03-20 15:21:00,4022,I'm getting my perch fish this weekend.  My first river fish will be opener with my son..  Hopefully with Brian guiding me...
842303,misfish,2014-03-20 17:03:00,29133,How did I get dragged into this? LOL
842308,Rustic-Fisher,2014-03-20 17:19:00,826,"Even with a long handle net ,most pools/runs we hit this week are just to tricky to land anything in right now .  Still been nice getting out and hooking a few .  Landing them was a different story."

842359,Rich,2014-03-20 20:30:00,3927,Ice is getting pretty soft down here I don't think I'm gonna push it any further so the steelhead gear has been dusted off! Pretty sick of drilling holes anyway!
842406,redpearl99,2014-03-20 23:27:00,259,Hmmmm I'm also thinking that most of the tribs will still be frozen over this weekend... tho the larger and faster flowing tribs will prob be open
842407,DRIFTER_016,2014-03-20 23:33:00,10439,"I'm sick of winter too, so I'm going fishing offshore in the Gulf of Mexico this weekend!!!"
842408,Garnet,2014-03-20 23:34:00,2056,It's easy!  Go ice fishing in the morning and Steelheading for the afternoon.
842450,Paulus,2014-03-21 03:03:00,522,fish'n for brownies this weekend... bait: chores around the house. The honey-do honey-done technique is really productive. Should have enough in the bank for the following weekend at which point I'm steelheading!    p.-
842455,Old Ironmaker,2014-03-21 07:28:00,8243,"I applaud you all willing to bounce a presentation from one ice berg to another in subzero temps, or even a balmy 1 or 2 degrees.  I've been there in younger days.  I was by the Grand today in Caledonia  where there is open water, it is high and it is flowing like 90.  Just be careful out there boys and girls.  I'm driving south Monday. As Popeye said "" that's all I can stands and can't stands no more !!!!!!!!!! ""  When it hits 20C that's where we're stopping. Big decision every morning, fishing of golfing? Maybe both."
842480,craigdritchie,2014-03-21 12:18:00,1586,"The handful of rivers that are fishable are still really, really cold from snow melt. And most of the fish are half-thawed holdovers from the fall. Still, anything beats standing on a frozen lake."
842488,12footspringbok,2014-03-21 14:10:00,459,Ice fish for steelhead....
