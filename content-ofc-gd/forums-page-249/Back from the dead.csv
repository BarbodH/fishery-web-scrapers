841661,Maverick,2014-03-17 00:08:00,371,"Well.....  I joined this forum a while back then went on a little hiatus. I was in school and was busy doing everything but fishing. Got married, had a kid and my wifes job moved north. We moved to Sturgeon Falls in October and I am finally settled in. I am looking forward to getting back to fishing more than once a year and posting more frequently. Hope all is well.  Brad"
841667,Rod Caster,2014-03-17 00:20:00,5784,Welcome to the north and congrats on the positive changes. Maybe we'll run into each other someday.
841722,Beans,2014-03-17 15:07:00,3339,Welcome back...I think we have a couple of members in Sturgeon Falls...

You know, some of us are highly offensive, others smoke crack..."
841819,Nipfisher,2014-03-18 05:03:00,2449,"Brad, do you have waterfront? We have a nice marina at our park and I usually have the boat in the water. I see the musky in your profile pic, just turns out I have no one in the park to throw baits with. They are all walleye anglers. The link I have in my posts is my buddy Danny Columby. He is one of the best musky guides on Nipissing. He boated 66 musky for his clients last year."

841904,Maverick,2014-03-18 20:16:00,371,"Ya I'm right on the lake just past the turn for Glenrock, almost at the end of the road. It's actually not a musky, it's a big northern. I have yet to catch the elusive musky but I have boated many 48"" plus northerns when I fished up in the NWT. If you could put me on a musky I would be in your debt."
842019,Nipfisher,2014-03-19 05:50:00,2449,"My bad, I tried to blow up the picture as the colour looked like pike but I thought the head looked like a musky. I got a 43"" Northern through the ice and it was a crazy fight. We can certainly try for some musky, there are a few good spots in our location and on the Sturgeon river. PM me closer to the May long weekend."

I'm gonna be at Lakair over on the West Arm the last week of June and then again the first 2 weeks of August.  Maybe we could get a few local OFCers together for a little musky G2G"

(I've only really fished for them a handful of times)"
842222,aplumma,2014-03-20 12:50:00,6896,Once you are on the boat ask Lew about the contest him and Art have on catching a muskie.lol   Art
842302,lew,2014-03-20 17:02:00,12766,"Your overdue Art, this could be your year and I hope it's in my boat"
842326,aplumma,2014-03-20 17:47:00,6896,I will keep you posted Lew but we are shooting for a trip up North in early August I think.   Art
