842900,OhioFisherman,2014-03-23 16:37:00,6623,"Thanks Joey, I have been to Huntsville, although many years ago. My buddy's uncle had a gas station - diner there an we took a break from fishing one day to visit."
842798,Joey,2014-03-23 03:07:00,9122,"We made some plans a week or so ago to head up to Lake of Bays with Fidel when our schedules jived, and today was the day.  Fidel arrived Friday night and as much as we tried to go to bed early, the gabfest lasted until midnight.  We knew 4 a.m. was going to be coming soon.  Ralphie had a new lap to sit on for the night    Up by 4:00 and pack and on the road, we got gas and were on the 400 by 5:55.  The road conditions were a disaster and had us all questioning if we were stupid or crazy, but forged ahead.  Had to laugh when some dingbat in a pick up passed us on the unplowed, unsalted highway doing mach 1.  Paul said ""bet we see him in the ditch up the road.""  Sure enough, 5 minutes later, he's into the guardrail.  Only a few more dingbats along the way, but we kept a steady, safe pace all the way with no problems.  Arrived at Lake of Bays by 8:30, which we all thought was fantastic time considering the weather, but there really weren't too many out there on the roads.  Got all set up and enjoyed the views.       Bet this place has a nice view, but a pain hauling all your gear down to the lake!     Lots of these open areas due to the bubbling springs       I thought this tree just stood out, making a statement, look at me      Fidel setting up          Every once in awhile, he'd go join Paul and fish in his ""lodge""       Our target was lakers, and Paul was first to ice one.  They are so dark in this lake.        We didn't get anything after that for quite some time so moved and after about an hour, it was go time.  I got into a nice little fatty, then Paul got into a whitefish, then pulled up another laker that was snagged, so let that one go.  Then Paul got another laker, then I got another Laker, and finally, Fidel got his laker.        I noticed the meat in these lakers is very orange, and Fidel says they taste fantastic.  He put on a filet clinic for me as I usually botch cutting out the Y bones.  He did a few and then I did the rest and had no problems after he showed me his tricks (and using my new filet knife that Art made me.  Thanks Art, it worked like a charm.  I only poked myself once and there was only a bit of blood.  Didn't even hurt the knife was so sharp).      ** not the filet knife in the picture - Fidel is using the knife Art made, the one in the pic was just for cutting off fins**            So it was a great day and we're glad we braved the weather and went.  It is so peaceful and quiet up there, especially after the big snowfall.  Of course, it snowed for the drive home too  Thanks for a fun time Fidel, let's do it all again soon."

842835,Fisherman,2014-03-23 12:26:00,7201,You always have the great photos for the story.
842837,Musky or Specks,2014-03-23 12:39:00,2710,Some very nice laker in that report. I wonder if thats a tree on its own or a cell phone tower. They are trying to disquise them up that way as pine trees.
842838,chris.brock,2014-03-23 12:42:00,4053," wow, dark lakers and nice orange flesh, it's still full blown winter up there eh,  looks like a great day"
842839,crappieperchhunter,2014-03-23 12:42:00,2582,Thx for sharing Joey. Loved the report and Pics.
842844,MJL,2014-03-23 13:15:00,2427,Fantastic report Joey  I'm really diggin' the look of those lakers. So dark. Is Lake O bays tea stained?
842848,can u fish,2014-03-23 13:34:00,326,Awesome report and love the photos thanks for sharing.
842853,NAW,2014-03-23 14:09:00,4022,Awesome Joey!!  We try to make it to LOB once a year.  No time this winter though...
842854,Joey,2014-03-23 14:11:00,9122,"Fantastic report Joey  I'm really diggin' the look of those lakers. So dark. Is Lake O bays tea stained?  Yes MJL, it is very tea stained.      I wonder if that is a cell tower Musky or Specks?  That would be kind of cool instead of the eyesore towers all over the place we have now.    Thanks All, I'm pretty bushed this morning but still having great thoughts about what a good time we had.  I'm just happy I could do a report.  I had been el skunko for lakers this entire season, so it was nice to get that off my back"
842855,muskymatt,2014-03-23 14:12:00,2608,Nice! 
842856,lew,2014-03-23 14:16:00,12766,"Thanks for that Joey, looks like a great day."
842857,wallacio,2014-03-23 14:18:00,475,"That ""tree"" is indeed a cell tower.   My in-laws live up there and there are a few of them that are constructed to look like trees."
842858,Musky or Specks,2014-03-23 14:19:00,2710," Yes MJL, it is very tea stained.      I wonder if that is a cell tower Musky or Specks?

842859,Jds63,2014-03-23 14:20:00,1365,"great report, thanks for sharing  that tree looks like the disguised cell tower on highway 60 in Algonquin Park â€¦ wonder if they did the same thing there ..."
842882,4x4bassin,2014-03-23 15:19:00,1025,"Nice report , those lake trout sure are dark"
842886,OhioFisherman,2014-03-23 15:45:00,6623,"LOL, I see zero water in those pictures, no wonder ice fishing never worked for me!  Pretty fish! Doesn't Lake of Bays pass under hwy 69?"
842888,Joey,2014-03-23 15:58:00,9122,Well I don't think we'll be seeing open water for quite some time up here OhioFisherman.  Not sure what you mean by under hwy 69?
842890,OhioFisherman,2014-03-23 16:10:00,6623,"Joey as I recall on our trips to Pointe Au Baril there was a bridge with a lake on either side of 69, with a sign nearby that said Lake of Bays? I could be mistaken, it has been a long time."
842892,Joey,2014-03-23 16:18:00,9122,"It's over near Huntsville, up hwy 11, but I'm sure there is probably a sign near Point Au Baril and you can go across that way."
842894,spincast,2014-03-23 16:25:00,3279,"great report, thanks."
842898,davey buoy,2014-03-23 16:37:00,5505,Very nice report!!!That tree thing is kinda cool.Who'da thought ???
