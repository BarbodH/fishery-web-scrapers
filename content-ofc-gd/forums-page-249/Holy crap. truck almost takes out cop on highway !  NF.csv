This brings me back back to flashing lights which we were all opinionated about, be they 4 way hazards or other emergency vehicles.   Studies have found that people drive towards things that attract their attention, like flashing lights.  They are annoying as ____, they can blind you and get you going in the wrong direction.   I'd much favour the ""sequential direction arrow""  or ""move left""  than the nuclear red and blue bubble gum machine.  And, for anymore that ever gets into the scenario, for christ sake, don't be standing between vehicles, get off the shoulder and on the other side of the guardrail if there is one."
