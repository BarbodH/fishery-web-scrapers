842051,Big Cliff,2014-03-19 17:24:00,6899,"Looking for a good home for a 3 year old begle!  Mandy is a fun loving, friendly and very affectionate pup. She loves to chase rabbits (or just about anything that moves) (haven't had a mouse in the house since we got her), loves kids and cats is house broken and very clean!  She has been fixed and has had all her shots and has no health issues!  As with any beagle, she needs room to run, and Sue and I just can't give her the exercise she needs. We have the invisable fence but our lot is only 3/4 of an acre. This is not a dog that would do well locked in a kennel all the time, she is too socialized.  If you are interested or know of someone that is, please let me know ASAP    Cell# 705-928-8899 Email [emailÂ protected] "

It breaks our hearts but it just isn't fair to her to be stuck with two old people! She loves to please, she loves to cuddle she is such a suck and very well behaved!"
