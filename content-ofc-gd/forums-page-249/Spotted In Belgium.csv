842387,craigdritchie,2014-03-20 22:08:00,1586,"Looking for a place to eat in Brugges, Belgium, and found this place, Den Gouden Karpel (""the good carp"").    I didn't order carp (at least not on purpose), but the rest of the menu was really good. Excellent fish and lobster chowder.  I skipped the calamari though ... it looked too much like deep fried carp lips.  MJL, you would love this place!"
842388,crappieperchhunter,2014-03-20 22:10:00,2582,What kinda wine do you  recommend with carp lips Craig

842436,MJL,2014-03-21 01:47:00,2427,Can I set up my rod pod and bite alarms in the kitchen to catch my dinner?
842478,craigdritchie,2014-03-21 12:10:00,1586,"Abasolutely! The restaurant is located near a canal, where there were a bunch of people set up with rod stands, catapaults, the whole works. They take carp fishing seriously there.  And nope, the restaurant doesn't likely get its fish that way. It's almost 100% C&R from what I gather."
