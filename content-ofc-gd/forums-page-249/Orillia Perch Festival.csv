At only 4 weeks away, someones going to have to do a lot of dancing to get the sunshine to melt off all that ice.  I can remember a number of years back, the second week still had ice on the main part of the bay out by Grape Is and just past the island on the Cooch side.  You could only launch at the Narrows by the campground at the bridge.  With the weather forecast for the next seven days, doesn't appear a whole lot of melting will take place."

842568,Fisherman,2014-03-21 23:34:00,7201,Bahahaha.  I suppose we could have raw egg races too if the bite is off..

842602,bigugli,2014-03-22 03:38:00,6138,"One of the first years we went to Perch fest, it opened on Easter weekend and there was still lots of ice.. We stayed at a motel, where the kids did their Easter egg hunt, and we ice fished all weekend. Rob also had his first encounter with thin ice. Tell the kid not to go there and...., you guessed it, SPLASH."
842608,LefroyFisherman,2014-03-22 12:17:00,602,Push the boat out and bring the auger! open water in serious jeopardy
842831,Fish Farmer,2014-03-23 11:58:00,2234,The Narrows is open out to the first green marker. The big problem is boat launching.
