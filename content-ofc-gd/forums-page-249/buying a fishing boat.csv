In canada in u.s. dont know who to trust whom to buy from.My buddy tells me ""watch out don't by a force engine"" don't buy a tracker I just want a good used fishing boat.Dont know of any marina's ugh. Ok i have vented i'll be ok Hey Caribou, It's a great time to start looking for a boat. But I would probably stick to buying in Ontario. The dollar is not at it's greatest moment right now and you'll sure be adding extra cost for nothing. Buying across the border is great and pictures do explain a thousand words but nothing like seeing the boat in person.  Check out marinas give them a call, most people who purchased a new boat will trade in there used. Marinas usually do a trade evaluation on the boat to see if it's even worth there time to resell to the next customer. If your looking at a private sale then make sure you still take it to a marina to have it inspected, sorta like a certification. Happy Boat Hunting.  Cheers"
843270,craigdritchie,2014-03-25 10:59:00,1586,"Gotta agree with Henry, buy the boat here. For a boat in that size/price range, whatever money you might save will be eaten up by the currency exchange, and your time/gas/hassle of going down there to see boats, arrange a mechanic to go with you, etc etc. Just not worth it, especially when you'll have zero post-sale service cross a border. At least here, if you buy it from a dealer, you have that."
843281,Cosmos,2014-03-25 12:01:00,588,I would recommend to buy it in US. I bought mine in US last month. It was easy process to bring it here - THANKS TO ALL GUYS HERE. I just followed a recommendations from one of old boat buying threads on forum. Different in price is huge even for small boat I got. Even with currency rate it's still worth it. I sold motor which came with my boat and bought another one here in Ontario. I saw a lot of good deals on kijiji - check Pennsylvania (Erie side) or New York State. I bought in Pennsylvania - was 4 hours drive from Newmarket one way. Border crossing is simple process if you have done your home work and have all paper work.
843285,HTHM,2014-03-25 12:05:00,4082,"I am looking at the US route right now as well, and am finding that the exchange is taking away the savings. Mind you I am looking at mid-range boats. What and when did you buy Costa?"

I agree if you're going to spend 15-20k, but not for a 14ft tiller...  You aren't going to save much if anything.. Hell you might actually spend more once you factor in exchange."
843295,woodenboater,2014-03-25 12:45:00,2277,"Unless you only plan to fish skinny water in very calm conditions, I would probably just sail past jon boats. If you have to hustle in bad weather, the jon boat is going to take a pounding as it slams every wave on the way back to the dock. V's will cut though chop better = more comfortable ride.  and agree with some others, if you're thinking of a 12 or 14 footer, I'd look in Ontario as any US savings will probably be eaten up by the drive to get the boat."

843314,fisher,2014-03-25 14:06:00,451,"I sold my boat a few months ago. In the dead of winter. No water test, no start up either (it was winter time and the buyer didn't want to have to re winterized it).  The deal was a such a good one that the buyer basically bought it without much look over and didn't want to pass it up as he had done with other deals he lost out on.  He asked lots of questions and basically trusted me. Also  for the price I sold it, he realized that I felt it wasn't worth trying to rip off somebody and then worrying if they'll seek some revenge in the future.  In my experience I think you can usually tell who might be trying to hide something and who is being honest.  Sometime we want to believe that someone is being honest for one reason or another when our gut says something just doesn't seem right. They guy was at my house and I was vey upfront with any issues it had.  Every boat has a quirk or two and I am sure he could tell I was being honest about all of mine.  If I were hiding something I would be elusive or vague with my responses.  I would meet elsewhere - not my house. I would not give my home number.  I would not call him from my workplace.  Etc.  Always go with your gut.  If something seems off, it probably is.  listen to your instincts  Having said all that, Not sure I would have bought a boat without at least a test run.  An important question to ask a private seller is why they are selling. Should be a story.  Try to gauge the truthfulness of the response to get an idea of if they are going to be truthful on everything else."

841371,Lape0019,2014-03-15 13:50:00,647,"First off, I own a tracker 190tx and would buy another one in a heartbeat. The only ones that have problems are the older tracker 175txw hulls but with a little research, you will figure this all out.  Force engines are not necessarily bad,  but they are a bare bones engine that if I had the choice, I would stay away from.  Honestly, I think of both Tracker and Force as entry level equipment. They serve a purpose to get you into you first boat at an affordable pricepoint.  My advice is if you are looking used, settle on a pricepoint and if it is aluminum you are looking for, look at Lund, Crestliner, or Princecraft. There are other great boats out there but these guys seem to be touted as the best. And try to get as close to max HP as possible. A lot of people under power their boat to try and save money. All this does is make you regret the purchase because the boat will not perform properly and you won't be happy with it...  Adam"
841379,lookinforwalleye,2014-03-15 14:23:00,4399,"There are a lot of good boats for sale out there and probably just as many that are not so good...I can tell you it is just as frustrating from the sellers point of view!!! I Tried to sell my Stratos a couple of years ago and for the most part I got a bunch of tire kickers and lowballers  trying to steal it from me, I had the boat at a price point where it should have sold you could not have gotten the same boat in the States for less but still everybody wanted it for 2-3 grand or more less than my asking price which was already under fair value."
841403,landry,2014-03-15 18:09:00,1005,I bought in the states twice. My advice is similar but I would pick a specific model and length that u like so that u can compare apples to apples. That's what I did. Then I looked daily for a few months and pounced when I saw a good value. Always water test it and have a mechanic go over it before u buy!!!!! No matter what Bull the tell you.

841411,BillM,2014-03-15 19:03:00,17367,Exchange rate isn't very good for buying over in the states now unfortunately.  You'll probably still save some $$$ but not all that much.

841437,landry,2014-03-15 22:10:00,1005,"Most sellers are good people for sure. However, when I sold my boats I made sure to have testing already done and printed from a marine mechanic and I insisted on a water test all three times. My reputation means more to me than money. Having said that I would not want my boat to be trailered for another test a couple hundred miles either. That would be silly. I would just encourage them to contact the mechanic/marina that already did the engine assessment. Selling boats is annoying as you do get a lot of annoying tire kickers and lowballers but the people that bought my boats were all good people in the end."
841438,aplumma,2014-03-15 22:17:00,6896,last boat I sold I spent 3 hours going over the boat with the new owners explaining all of the quirks that had showed up in the past. We went over the as is sold contract  and answered any questions he had as to what AS IS means. We squared up on the price and I returned $100.00 to him towards any items that I did not know about. This follows two basic rules of selling something  Get the terms in writing and the correct price is the one where both parties are happy.  BTW the boat is still running like a champ and we fish together regularly.  best of luck   Art

A boat that I can take comfortably on all of our back lakes might be NFG for Lake Ontario.  I will NEVER go back to a console/steering wheel, but there are folks who will NEVER buy a tiller boat.

841798,jackal68,2014-03-18 01:21:00,68,Thanks for the feed back guys. I am not familiar with the big waters. Erie or Ontario is just way to out of my wheel house or interest. the whole down rigger is not my bag. Im looking like an older Peterborough with an outboard right down to a 14 footer. im starting to lean towards a jon boat. I live right by the grand and the only passengers would be me my son and maybe daughter. Or who knows. any suggestions on 12 and fourteen footers with kickers.
841801,akaShag,2014-03-18 01:30:00,2073,"I have owned a lot of boats, all but one smaller rigs.  When I was finally going to buy a brand new boat because I had saved up enough money, I asked a professor of mechanical engineering if I should buy a boat with a fiberglass or aluminum hull.  Well, to distill his advice down to its basics, if you EVER pull your boat up on sand or a rock, or if you EVER leave it out in the sun, you might not want to have a fiberglass hull.  I thought that was very valuable advice and bought a Sylvan with an aluminum hull, and have never looked back.  That was fifteen years ago, many days on the water, and I am a VERY happy camper.  Sylvan boat, Honda outboard, for my fishing I have a perfect outfit.  For Caribou, you might find that a twelve footer is just not enough boat if you do want to fish three people.  It can be done, I did for years, but there is not much space and an excited passenger can give you some pretty spiritual experiences.  Doug"
841831,BillM,2014-03-18 12:18:00,17367,"No need to go to the US for a 14ft tiller, they are everywhere around here.  Before we purchased our Lund we had a 15ft Legend Widebody tiller with a 40hp Honda 4 stroke.   With a few improvements made (front casting deck, livewell, etc) it was probably one of my favourite boats..  Extremely stable, crazy fuel mileage, took the rough water without any issues, just an awesome boat.   I wouldn't hesitate to recommend one.   Sold it to a guy who cottages on Sparrow."
841835,bushart,2014-03-18 13:04:00,2628,If you check Kijiji regularly---I see little 14 footers with regularity  You may have to find several sellers for boat/motor and trailer  And like all said---test it out  Getting towed back to shore somewhat stinks
