Anyone with any experience on big gull? What can I expect? What presentations should I be using? And in general how's the fishing?  Thanks,  Gerrit"

Sad, 3 of them are not with us anymore, just in our thoughts. You have to work for your Walleye, We use jig and worm drifting, but you have to find them. Beautiful lake. 85% crown land. They seem to say jig and Leech works best. I can send you a bit of a hot spot map Gerritt if I had your email. If your up there Gerritt when we are I could show you where we fish and catch, SOMETIMES Some say, don't follow me"
