534995,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-01-05 20:12:00,0,"Hey OFNers...Trying to get out and enjoy what little snow we have on the lakes up here...  Seems somewhere in the my travels the last few days my headlight, tach, and console lights stopped working... electric start and RER are still functioning.  The fuses appear to all be fine.   What do you guys think is the problem?   Regulator?  Relay?  Something else?"
535017,aplumma,2011-01-05 20:59:00,6896,Check the connections and replace the good looking fuse. Their should not be a relay or regulator in that circuit.   Art
535026,skeeter,2011-01-05 21:12:00,1907,"also reach up under the back of the ignition and wiggle the wires there. and like aplumma said replace the fuses that even look good , i have been down that road-LOL"
535031,lakerguy,2011-01-05 21:21:00,224,"If its a rev,check the relay, black cube above secondary"
535033,Fisherman,2011-01-05 21:29:00,7201,"Dr. S, had a very similar problem on an 04 Skandic, rear light, fuel gauge and tach running spordically. Ended up being a bare chaffed wire that runs through the tube along side the running board, it was a real pain to diagnose, the bare part was facing down and if I hadn't seen a tiny spark while rattling things, I was ready to take the big hammer out."
535098,Sharkbait22,2011-01-05 23:56:00,297,"Good suggestions.  Check the socket connections.  Hit the socket with some grease. As said, replace the fuse. Get a volt meter on it.  Is there voltage to the light?  Is the circuit grounded out? Good luck."
535146,12footspringbok,2011-01-06 01:12:00,459,Voltage Regulator.
535169,Old Man,2011-01-06 01:45:00,822,"Did the lights get brighter then burn out. If so, you voltage regulator is shot. If the bulbs are still good, it could be a faulty lighting coil in the magneto."
535266,trapshooter,2011-01-06 03:36:00,1234,"If I remember right, you have a 02-03 Skidoo Grand Touring?  Nearly the same as mine.  I had the same issues last year and it was the voltage regulator.  Not a cheap part either.  Good luck."
535295,discophish,2011-01-06 04:14:00,392,"I would say for sure it's the regulator.  Actually, I just checked my Yamaha Venture .pdf service manual, and yup, it's the regulator.  I bet your tail lights are on the same circuit.  Hope it's only a scuffed wire though!  Regulators aren't cheap.  Good luck"
535441,lakerguy,2011-01-06 17:58:00,224,http://www.royaldistributing.com/main/index.php?option=com_flippingbook&view=book&id=14&Itemid=419&firstPageNumber=98    If it is a volt reg.there not too badly priced here.Not sure what a dealer would cost...   Volt regs are on pg 106
535448,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-01-06 18:22:00,0,  about 100 dollars just to walk in the door!
535681,Kerry,2011-01-07 01:54:00,383,Royal might be cheaper but after going thru two coils on my old arctic cat in one year because the wires couldn't take any vibration at all I gave up and bought a factory one.Never had a problem after that.Cheap chinese made junk. Kerry
535705,BrownTown,2011-01-07 02:50:00,103,Could be the voltage regulator or check the wiring harness..Not sure of it was those sleds but some were coming in contact with the exhaust and shorting out.
535729,Old Man,2011-01-07 03:40:00,822,"If you have an ohm meter, you can easily test the lighting coil(s) on the stator. Attached is a link to video on You Tube explaining how to test stators.  http://www.google.ca...hc8Rhyw&cad=rja  It could be the Voltage Regulator, but if it is, it's likely that you would have blown some or all of the lights on your sled."
535761,brickNblock,2011-01-07 06:49:00,598,"Hey Doc, like most the others have said...voltage regulator but first... wiggle some wires...it actualy works and when you find one that does the trick..take it apart and clean it up/connections too.. Most of the time I found it to just be spark tho.....They sit for so long oper the non-snow months and water=rust"
535930,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-01-07 17:52:00,0,"Just to clarify the symptoms, no lights are working.  the only thing electrical that works is the electric start and RER, but because the battery is draining, they don't work now either.  could this problem be affecting my sparkplugs as well?  went to load the sled on the trailer and it will idle fine, but when i apply throttle it pops and loses power like it's not getting a proper spark...  hopefully going to be serviced soon!  no sled makes me sad!"
535954,Old Man,2011-01-07 18:20:00,822," It's the lighting coil on the stator. It provides all the power to run lights, accessories, and charges the battery."
535962,DRIFTER_016,2011-01-07 18:35:00,10439," Yep, sure sounds like it, or the regulator. Check the light bulbs with an ohm meter and if the bulbs read as open it's the regulator. If the bulbs are good it's most likely the coil."
537412,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-01-10 14:17:00,0,"well, to the great minds guiding me towards the regulator and the stator, you were both right!  both are faulty and in need of replacement.  500 dollars in parts!"
537419,Old Man,2011-01-10 14:55:00,822, Ouch
537461,DRIFTER_016,2011-01-10 16:49:00,10439,"Yep, toy parts ain't cheap. I had to replace the stator assy. on my '89 CR125 Honda for the nifty sum of $600 once. Wasn't too impressed either. Never had another problem with the bike after I replaced it though."
537490,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-01-10 18:40:00,0,mine was 300 but i was told that some arctic cat stators go for 900 bucks so i guess i should feel fortunate?  be nice to have her back regardless...  winter's too short as it is!
