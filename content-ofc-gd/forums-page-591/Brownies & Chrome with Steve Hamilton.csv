537908,Aaron Shirley,2011-01-11 13:40:00,655,"No prob Steve, glad to have you and your dad out. It's been years since we've been out, but I'm sure the next trip we share a boat will not be that far off   It's always fun to fish with ya Steve. Oh, and it would have been an Ontario record drum if I kept it, not a world record. The world record is 54lbs"
537915,I'mHooked,2011-01-11 14:02:00,525,"Well Ontario is the centre of the universe, so an Ontario record is as good as a Universal Record Aaron!  Nice looking day there Aaron & Steve.  What's a little snow when you're hauling in the Chrome!"
537918,Grimace,2011-01-11 14:04:00,2020,Excellent.   I love the snowstorm shots and all the snow in the boat.
537964,Mike Pike,2011-01-11 15:25:00,1332,"An awesome trip and some great photos to remember it by, Aaron!  Nice job by all you guys.  I've met your buddy Steve a few times in the Hammer.  A good guy who always has time to chat fishing and share.  Nice to see you guys adjust to the hand nature delt you and have yourselves a successful day on the water."
537999,TDunn,2011-01-11 17:19:00,680,Hardcores! What I would do to catch some browns.... Awesome!  TDunn
538220,WeedLine,2011-01-12 01:06:00,322,I love fishing in adverse conditions and getting on 'em. You guys deserved those fish. Nice report.
538224,vinnimon,2011-01-12 01:10:00,2593,"Good job and great report aaron You guys deserved it, battling the weather and your efforts"
537521,Aaron Shirley,2011-01-10 19:55:00,655,"It's been a while since Steve and I have fished together, and this would be a memorable day for both of us and his father Glen who joined us.  I invited Steve and his father out to fish the Niagara River with me on Saturday, and we hatched a game plan. I heard the upper Niagara was clear, so we were all excited!  I stayed up late tying fresh goopy roe bags and watched the Leafs crush Atlanta! I don't get too see many games this year that are so lopsided (at least for the Leafs   ), so it was a treat. A good omen for Saturday  We arrived at Queenton eager on Saturday morning, but to a muddy river choked with heavy ice flows    This was confusing, as nothing warranted a muddy river in my mind. I believe it was coming from Buffalo, as above the dams was choked with ice and just as muddy. The upper river was clear on the ON side, muddy on the NY side.  We decided to try Port Dalhousie, and it was the right choice. We fished in the channel all the way out to the lake, and even drifted out in Lake Ontario itself hitting steelies and browns. This would be a different trip for Steve though, as we were not trolling  Steve and his dad were excited to try something new.  We got pounded by two seperate snow storms which we kept fishing through   It was a great day, and we got lots of strange looks from people walking the pier while we fished Lake O in a snow storm lol. We got lots of browns and steelies drifting fresh roe bags in pink, white and peach.  On to the photos. And yes, I did catch more than one fish lol, but my guests put most of the fish into the Lund when they caught on to the style of fishing   Enjoy the photos, mixed shots from my cam and Steve's.          Snow squalls coming in on the horizon!                               Glen almost got a shot of his nice steelhead lol, camera shy fish made a quick exit           Good fishing!  Aaron"
537523,bare foot wader,2011-01-10 19:59:00,1354,"diehards to brave the storm, paid off...beauty healthy clean fish!  BUT...rapala rep using NRX?!?!"
537526,msp,2011-01-10 20:04:00,1336,Your the man Aaron ! A true die hard.

537541,Dozer,2011-01-10 20:24:00,896,That right there is amazing   Pretty crazy!
537546,aplumma,2011-01-10 20:32:00,6896,nice fish but i think you crossed the line into loonyville. Of course you got to consider the source I am from a place were snow is a four letter word.(ssssh I know it has 4 letters but it would not be funny if I said anything else)   Art
537549,corvette1,2011-01-10 20:39:00,1765,awesome job on that mixed bag on sat i could see the snow coming in from the lake then up the cliff wear i live
537573,bdox,2011-01-10 21:14:00,329,"For a second I thought this was an NRX advertisement! Way to go Steve, Dad & Aaron."

537601,Aaron Shirley,2011-01-10 22:06:00,655,"Thanks guys, it was a fun day out  Oh, and I use Rapala rods, big bucks Steve was using the NRX lol.  Blair, that fish was caught in the lake. A fresh steelie that will more than likely spawn in the early spring. Steelies you get in the tribs colour up and may be winter spawners, or just starting to colour up while getting ready for the spawn early spring. They don't all run the rivers and spawn at the same time. They are all different shapes, sizes and colours in a heavily stocked fishery like Niagara, Port D., and I'm sure have many strains."
537604,asdve23rveavwa,2011-01-10 22:15:00,2690,Very nice!!  Some days it sure pays to brave the elements
537606,Rod Caster,2011-01-10 22:17:00,5784,simply awesome!!

537630,BillM,2011-01-10 22:58:00,17367,"Aaron, simply awesome man!!   I'd like to wearing my floater while bringing in steelhead instead of perch this time of year, lol."
537632,irishfield,2011-01-10 23:03:00,26272,Can't say I've ever seen a boring post that featured Stevie Hamilton...
537639,kevin booth,2011-01-10 23:13:00,57,"wow you guys are hardcore,just when i thought i was hardcore you guys pull off a day like that.congrats on the fish and beaties they are.i know it takes alot of extra work to get the boat out this time of year so way to go guys iam glad it paid off for your work and dedication.i love seeing extreme in the sport of fishing."
537658,Steve,2011-01-10 23:40:00,2075,"When Aaron announced he was discontinuing the show, I, like many, was saddened. However, I knew he spoke from his heart, and it was the right decision. I also knew it was going to open up some fantastic opportunities to fish with one of the best!  I was fortunate enough to be invited to fish with Aaron this past weekend. Even better my father was joining us.  One of the best ways to build our skill as anglers is to fish with others. A day on the water with Aaron is a goldmine. I can't remember when Dad and I had so much fun just simply fishing together. Usually we are ""working"" to fish....this time we just sat back and relaxed. When the east winds kicked up, Aaron basically put 100% of his time and effort keeping the boat in position, and for that, dad and I thank him greatly.  Throughout the day we hatched plans for hitting other bodies of water, discussing tactics for many different species of fish...  we talked cats, browns, salmon, bass, walleye, hell, just about anything that swam...oh, and when your with the world record drum holder, you just can't go without discussing the mighty sheephead!  Aaron, again, thank you."
537661,bdox,2011-01-10 23:43:00,329,"I know Steve, and am just bugging him. I know he's reading this!"
537673,spincast,2011-01-11 00:01:00,3279,"Awesome report - thats hard core boating, and the rewards beauty"
537701,Rizzo,2011-01-11 00:51:00,4754,"When I left your place that night Aaron we drove through some pretty heavy snow...until we hit Barrie, then it stopped (something does not seem right about that statement). Turn on the radio on the drive home to hear the announcer say ""And now the Leafs have an 8 goal lead"" (something REALLY doesn't seem right about that statement). Good on you guys for toughing it out, it clearly paid off."
537729,canadian_copper,2011-01-11 01:40:00,925,AWESOME WORK. NOT MANY OF US AROUND THAT ARE WILLING TO ENDURE THE ELEMENTS LIKE THAT . LOVE THE PIC OF THE BOAT WITH ABOUT A FT OF SNOW IN IT . LOL GREAT FISH GUYS. WELL EARNED.
