Good things are on the go and it has a lot to do with the good folks in this community.  Second, HAPPY NEW YEAR!!  It's been a fantastic 2010.  Lots of epic trips, new friends and lessons learned afield.  All these threads with pics and music have offered quite the inspiration, so here's a montage of my own with some of the years best, plus a few randoms for a little comic relief.  So sit back, pop a brew and turn the speakers up!!  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eOLQETaJe6E  cheers!! HD"
