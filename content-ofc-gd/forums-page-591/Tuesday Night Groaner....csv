But just before she could throw herself from the docks, a handsome young man stopped her ""You have so much to live for,"" said the man. ""Look, I'm a sailor, and we're off to  Europe  tomorrow, and I can stow you away on my ship. ""I'll take care of you, bring you food every day, and keep you happy.""   With nothing to lose, combined with the fact that she had always wanted to go to  Europe , the woman accepted.  That night the sailor brought her aboard and hid her in a lifeboat. From then on, every night he would bring her three sandwiches and make love to her until dawn.  Three weeks later she was discovered by the captain during a routine inspection.  ""What are you doing here?"" asked the captain.  ""I have an arrangement with one of the sailors,"" she replied. ""He brings food and I get a free trip to  Europe ..""  ""I see,"" the captain says.  ""Plus,"" she adds, ""He's screwing me.""  ""He certainly is,"" replied the captain. ""This is the  Newfoundland   Ferry."""
