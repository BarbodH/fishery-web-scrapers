537893,The Urban Fisherman,2011-01-11 12:43:00,2050,"Nice job Buddy!  Hopefully our day is more like that.....  And less like this day out there.... haha    Can't wait to get out!  Cheers, Ryan"
537896,The Urban Fisherman,2011-01-11 12:53:00,2050," Like Rich said the little largies are always active in there....I'm not sure if it's just because their active or that there's so many small fish in there but they can be a pain when you're ice fishing for sure.  As for the poachers, please drop the CO's a call if you see them out and poaching, or even take a picture of their activity.  It's a small body of water, and poaching can really hurt the lake.  There's a FALSE rumor going around my area that you're allowed to keep the trout because their stocked fish.  The resident brown population is especially sensitive during late fall and winter and I'd hate to see that fishery take a hit.  Cheers, Ryan"
537431,Rich,2011-01-10 15:17:00,3927,"Sleded, his buddy Josh and I headed out yesterday for some perch action. What beautiful weather. Perch were sitting on deep weeds in 26 feet of water, and seemed to only be hungry for jigging spoons. Only one keeper on minnows.  Kept 9.                "
537432,marth11,2011-01-10 15:22:00,60,"looks like a fun trip, and tasty BBQ, im quite envious of you guys, I'm still stuck in class till noonish or till I get bored of doing work  , what kind of jigging spoons where you guy's using, I usually use swedish pimple, or small buckshots?"
537434,Rich,2011-01-10 15:23:00,3927,"Acme Kastmaster is my personal fav but any worked.. Tinglers, Buckshots, Pimples."
537437,marth11,2011-01-10 15:25:00,60,"Thanks, and once again congrats on the great fishing trip."
537439,Grimace,2011-01-10 15:28:00,2020,Excellent.   Gotta love cooking out on the ice and catching fish
537441,daryl0815,2011-01-10 15:30:00,225,"sounds like a good day, nice brown by the way, I have never caught one through the ice!"
537442,Joey,2011-01-10 15:32:00,9122,"Excellent report Rich, complete with breakfast on ice!!!  Although I was afraid to open this thread with the almost pornographic title  Joey"
537450,Rich,2011-01-10 15:51:00,3927,"The brown, by the way was an incidental catch, Josh caught it on a minnow when he was experimenting a little deeper. It was out of season and therefore released. Thanks everyone for the comments it was certainly a day that seemed too good to be true."
537451,GBW,2011-01-10 16:03:00,8460,that's what I was thinking too!
537452,irishfield,2011-01-10 16:03:00,26272,Now I'm hungry.....
537465,I'mHooked,2011-01-10 16:54:00,525,Hey that's awsome! Love the grill.  I thought I was going to see a picture of a 'Chronzy' style not-on-the 'shore lunch' Perch fry!  Looks like was fun.
537468,asdve23rveavwa,2011-01-10 17:02:00,2690,"Nice going, have to give that spot a try soon as well  How thick is the ice, Rich?"
537481,highdrifter,2011-01-10 18:13:00,2534,Nice.  Well done slim!

537556,corvette1,2011-01-10 20:46:00,1765,you guys did awesome congrats
537557,pics,2011-01-10 20:47:00,1268,my buddy and I fished there last week..all the perch were wormy that we caught...We also caught and released about 15 largemouth bass...I'm not sure why they were so active?? Watch for the white chev truck with the cap on the back--poachers!!  3 rods each and they were keeping the trout!!
537569,misfish,2011-01-10 21:11:00,29133,No thats how you go ice fishing.Good report Rich.
537584,asdve23rveavwa,2011-01-10 21:29:00,2690,  I'd be giving the tips line a shout really quick!!
537592,Dozer,2011-01-10 21:43:00,896,...damn I was hoping to see what spooning perch looked like
537715,Rizzo,2011-01-11 01:17:00,4754,...you know what they say...spooning may lead to forking...but if its anything jumbo I don't want to hear about it
537718,asdve23rveavwa,2011-01-11 01:20:00,2690,
537845,ah_long,2011-01-11 05:47:00,354,damn.... this makes me hungry
537866,Rich,2011-01-11 10:45:00,3927," No worms in these ones.  And yes, I didn't bother taking pics, but incidental largies are pretty common there. Lots of 10 - 14 inch fish... they just seem to go crazy there in winter like no other place I've been.  As for the poachers, they will be very unhappy one of these days. Undercover CO's were out and on the ball. Badges flashed, stuff searched. They're looking for trout and bass keeper dudes, and people fishing with too many lines. Told me they'd be coming back regularly, too much of an issue with locals keeping trout.  I'm hoping it was you who tipped them off buddy, if so thank you! Great to finally see MNR out there."
