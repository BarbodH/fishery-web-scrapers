535765,chris.brock,2011-01-07 08:23:00,4053,"I kept 3 brown bullheads in my aquarium. They are very tough and tolerant, I just fed them table scraps, I ran a filter and no aerator and they did fine. I released them when they grew too large. Very cool pets. I've tried other species too. I had a tadpole madtom, he was a little more finicky then the bullheads. Pike and musky where difficult to feed unless you had the right sized live bait. One of the most unique guys I had was a green sunfish. Very aggressive and would harm the other fish in the tank. He died, I found him dead, out of the tank, he must have made a jump about 5 times his length to clear the tank."
535768,sauce,2011-01-07 10:07:00,219,"I had two bluegills last winter. Big one was mean and skittish. Drop in a minnow, he'd kill then hide. Little one was freindly and gently plucked maggots and waxies from my fingers. He'd sit just under the surface waiting."
535809,hammercarp,2011-01-07 13:51:00,964,I just remembered a funny story about the bullheads I kept. Like I said they grew like crazy and ate a lot. I had a large filter with 1 inch siphon tubes going into it. I had to take the baskets off the ends of the tubes because their turds were so big they would clog the basket and stop the siphons from working. One day I noticed a large round welt on the top of one of the catfishes flat broad head. I could not figure out what was causing this until one day I saw the cause. This one bullhead would rest on the side of the tank where the filter was. I watched as the fish was slowly lifted up. His body stayed level. Then his head would get stuck on the end of one of the siphon tubes. The catfish didn't even wake up. It would just stay there stuck on the end of the tube. This created the large round welt on the top of his head. When the fish woke he simply shake himself loose. I moved the filter and it solved the problem.
535974,MillerPhoto,2011-01-07 18:48:00,147,"In my personal view, yes you are transporting the fish, but you are not placing them in another body of water.. I look at it as you using your Aquarium as a ""holding tank/livewell"" but they would count against your limit since they are still living. I would go by the daily limit for which your house resides in the zone. So if you limit is say 50 crappie and you have 5 crappie in the aquarium.. If you go fishing down the road in the same zone, your daily limit would be 45, as you technically have 5 still alive in your possesion at home.  I have never came across any law about transporting live fish from one body of water to home, as I prefer to keep the fish alive as long as possible until I am home to clean and package them.  If it was against the law to keep fish alive in your livewell, with your boat on the trailer.. I think there would be issues with all Catch and Release fishing Tournaments.. As the fish are placed in boxes to be kept alive to take ashore to the weigh station before they are released back in the water.  As for the fish being kept in a aquarium and not having much color, its due to their surroundings. if you place bright objects and plants in the aquarium and there is lots of natural light in the room they will stay bright.. Its just like camo, most fish adapt to their surroundings."
535987,TJQ,2011-01-07 19:07:00,7806,"I had a chat with my local CO when I was keeping fish.. I was told that the unofficial version is nobody really cares... but that ANY fish in the tank are considered part of your possession limit... of all the fish I kept the small gar pike was BY FAR my favorite. Watching him/her eat minnows was absolutely fascinating.  Rock bass and Sunfish are very easy to keep, (You can get them to come right up and eat the worms out of your hands. Monique had them trained.. they new when they saw the white worm cup, it was feeding time.. they were pretty smart.). catfish too.. the rest are tough, pike keep bumping up against the glass , pickeral, perch and bass don't last at all. Mudpuppies.. are awesome!! (till they crawl up in the filter. I had two small ling that actually crawled outta the tank, we never did find the one.. lol maybe he made it back to the lake.  and if you have bass in the tank... make sure your pleko.. umm is bigger.. gulp.... or you'll be buying a bigger one.  the best thing i learned with those fish is that when they are not hungry... they are just not hungry. it was fun to watch a bass swim around with a 6 inch worm draped over his nose and not be in the slightest bit interested. I dont know much about fish, but i did learn alot while watching them feed... like 90% of the time they take the minnow head first!"
536035,Victor,2011-01-07 20:06:00,1609,"the main purpose of the ""no transporting live fish"" reg is to ensure that species won't get introduced to waterbodies where they didn't exist before and protect the ecosystems ... so IMO as long as you do not release whatever you're transporting to another water body then it's okay. Not saying it's really the right with respect to the regs but it doesn't do any harm.   where did you get the gar pike TJ? Was it store bought?"
536112,GBW,2011-01-07 22:06:00,8460,"you guys are making me want to fill up my old minnow tank again.  well, not that one cause I gave it and everything with it away, but another one I have.

536503,JohnF,2011-01-08 16:36:00,3494,"Do some research on water temps. My buddy has been keeping local fish for a few years and often uses frozen plastic water bottles to keep temps in line. He keeps an assortment of critters including crayfish, cats (which I actually first found for him in a squirming baby fishball being herded by a few adults) and panfish along with a few minnow species. It's pretty interesting sometimes. He spends hours observing them but then he's an artist and we all know they're a different breed, right?  I used to worry about him transporting them in my vehicle but I've gotten used to it. He's very careful about keeping the fish trapped in one location all together in one tank and so on. No mix and match of locations. Keeps down the risk of disease and dseems to work very well for him. He has a very high survival rate, better than I ever had with tropicals.  JF"

I've always been fascinated with the fish species in Ontario, and was wondering if it was legal to keep them in an aquarium? Bluegill have beautiful colouring, but I was thinking more of raising a bullhead (you can catch huge amounts of tiny ones at centennial, so many dead ones lying around from pissed off carp fishermen), but according to aquariumwiki it needs atleast a 90 gallon."

535328,hammercarp,2011-01-06 11:00:00,964,"I don't know what the current laws are but I kept some bullheads in a 35 gal. I caught them in a small creek and they were about 3-4 inches long. They eat like pigs and they grow like weeds. In about a year they were over 10"" long. There were 4 of them and I fed them beef heart. Commercial fish food was too costly to feed them. I would use the cheap frozen shrimp now a days. And yes even guys that are fishing for carp can be   s. We see stupid behavior in Hamilton at the Desjardin canal in front of the fish trap every spring."
535337,wallyboss,2011-01-06 12:10:00,1095,I think that it is illegal.  Not supposed to possess live fish except in your livewell while on the water. A live fish in your livewell and teh baot is on the trailer is illegal.
535341,Fishnwire,2011-01-06 12:39:00,983,"While I have to admit I don't know much about the actual legalities involved, I do have experience keeping wild fish in aquariums. - I had about a half dozen small sunfish and perch in a 55 gallon.  The first thing you need to know is that in an aquarium under fluorescent lights, both the sunfish and the perch were practically colourless.  They always appeared ""washed out"", never displaying bright colours or even well defined markings.  They just looked ""blah"".  Nothing like how they look top-side in the sun.  Understand that before you proceed. - The other thing is they are a little boring.  They don't move around in an interesting way or interact with each other at all.  My buddy had a handful of very small (3-5 inch) crappie he over-wintered one year.  They were the ""boringest"" fish I ever saw kept.  They just stayed in a loose school all day in one corner of the tank.  Zero personality.  He let them go in the spring. - Another problem you're going to experience is they are ""messy"" like you wouldn't believe.  I'm not sure what tropicals you have experience with, but most native fish you are going to keep are bigger and grow faster than the average tropical.  You need a lot of filtration and you'll be siphoning matter from the bottom of the tank every couple of days, if you don't want to look at piles of it. - That said, there are still native species I'd like to try keeping.  I read a blurb in In-Fisherman about a decade ago that was about certain states having the right to sell muskie fry intended for the home aquarium market.  That would be pretty cool.  I've also always wanted to put a dozen or so one inch small mouth bass fry into a heavily structured tank about 90 gallons or so.  I sold all my tanks and got rid of all my equipment a couple years ago.  There are times when I really miss the hobby and consider getting back into it.  My wife would prefer I didn't.  What do you think will happen?"
535344,Fishnwire,2011-01-06 12:49:00,983,"BTW...if you are in the market for a new aquarium...check out Kijiji.  There are always lots of guys getting out of the hobby and wanting rid of their space-sucking tanks.  I've seen 100 gallon tanks with Oak stands, good lights and top-notch filters for $500.  I wouldn't be surprised if a new 55 gallon kit with a plain metal stand from Big Al's is going to cost that much."

535353,wallyboss,2011-01-06 13:20:00,1095,"Thanks Buster  Transporting Sport Fish in Ontario   It is contrary to the Fish and Wildlife Conservation Act to stock or transport live sport fish without a permit.   The cage in the water where you are fishing is not ""transporting"" It is considered your livewell while you are fishing.  If you want to put the fish in an aquarium you would have to transport them."
535358,hammercarp,2011-01-06 13:45:00,964,There seems to be a distinction between sport fish and coarse fish in the regs. Are bullhead sport fish or coarse fish?
535362,jimmer,2011-01-06 14:09:00,2730,"After years of having an aquarium, I would go along with the post that those fish are very boring.  Go with African Chiclids, you will be much more pleased with the clours and personalities of the fish. If you decide to go with wild native fish, just don't tell anyone and there won't be a problem.  Yes, there are laws in place for transporting fish, so don't put them in another body of water when you tire of them. Just my thoughts."
535367,craigdritchie,2011-01-06 14:25:00,1586,"This seems to be a grey area, and my gut sense is that if you ask three different conservation officers, you will likely get three different answers.  The formal Ontario fishing regulations stipulate that you cannot transport live game fish. So the question is, what is and what is not a 'game' fish? By MNR's own definition, 'game fish' does not include most coarse species (like bullheads) or panfish (like bluegills). Those, it would seem, can be transported alive without any problem (just like various live minnows).  Having said that, I've kept different kinds of fish in a tank and was told by MNR that was not a problem providing I considered my captive fish as part of my daily bag limit. I got that in writing and kept the letter as insurance, since I was a full-time outdoor writer at the time and didn't need any kind of fishery violation on my hands. If you're worried about it, write a letter to the MNR district office and see what they mail you back.  Most entertaining wild fish I ever kept was a rock bass. They're completely psychotic."
535375,frozen-fire,2011-01-06 14:39:00,542,Never EVER release fish you have kept in an aquarium back into the wild. You can potentially introduce viruses/diseases into our natural systems.

535431,crossover,2011-01-06 17:29:00,172,"Thanks for the replies guys, a couple of things:  I've heard that transporting live sport fish is illegal. How about when someone takes one of those cages where they keep their limit, and put it in the back of the car without killing the fish? Technically these fish are still live, and a couple would be able to make it if you were to release them in another, nearby water body.  @fishnwire: I've seen videos on youtube of people hand feeding blue gill, those guys are crazy. Maybe keeping a species only tank would stress the fish out less, and they might be more active. I'm thinking of perhaps trying with local chub/sucker, seeing if they'll survive in the water parameters, and then moving up. And I've also checked out kjiji last night, tons of great deals.  I wonder if these fish would eat the shrimp from my shrimp tank."

We had a big fish tank with rockbass and pan fish from a local pond we caught. I believe if you want to keep them you need a permit and must be inspected by the MnR. Of course if noone finds out I guess you can do whatever you want.

535757,John Bacon,2011-01-07 05:51:00,3277, Technically they are breaking the law by transporting a live sport fish.  I think that it is unlikely that a CO would press charges if the fish wasn't being kept in water; but you never know.  Transporting any species that can legally be used for bait (ie suckers) may be okay.  Keep in mind that there are limits to how many bait fish that you can possess.
