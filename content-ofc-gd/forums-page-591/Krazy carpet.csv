538015,SylvanOwner,2011-01-11 17:53:00,266,"  Was going to try that this week.  Royal Distributing sells them, http://www.royaldistributing.com/main/index.php?option=com_flippingbook&view=book&id=14&Itemid=419&firstPageNumber=136, Profile #4 is Yamaha.  Turn the page and at the bottom right is the Yamaha section.  You can get a 47"" strip for about $12 but dealers you say.....for free you say......hmmmm....  Will let you know how it goes.  Dan"
537394,misfish,2011-01-10 13:37:00,29133,"Anyone  seen this stuff any where ? It,s cheap enough to add to the bottom of the portable and makes for easy pulling.  Thanks"
537397,Headhunter,2011-01-10 13:39:00,5703,Toys are Us! HH
537398,skeeter,2011-01-10 13:41:00,1907,LOL i remember those things. and yes they still sell them. but i would think they are a little to thin to last.
537400,GBW,2011-01-10 13:56:00,8460,"Hey Brian, I just found them on the CT site for $4.00 each."
537409,bushart,2011-01-10 14:12:00,2628,Many a moose and deer got drug out by sled by putting the old crazy carpet under---just sayin
537430,irishfield,2011-01-10 15:17:00,26272,"Crazy carpet is no slippier(sp) than the polyethylene hut to begin with. The only thing that may help you is to buy/make the UHMW / Hyfax runners to put on the hut, which will lift it off some of the hull on light snow to cut drag."
537440,misfish,2011-01-10 15:29:00,29133," It,s the rough surface thats making it hard to drag.I,ll see if I can get that stuff Wayne.  Thanks guys"
537446,Muskieman,2011-01-10 15:44:00,2472,Ahh! the Crazy Carpet!!  As a kid my Mom wouldn't let me cross the street on my bicycle because it was too dangerous...  but would let me slide down a tree laden hill @ 40MPH.  I just picked up some 6 footers @ CTC for 5.99/ea..  I've seen aluminium toboggans used a runners on shacks and worked very well .  Randy 
537448,GBW,2011-01-10 15:49:00,8460,"Brian, have you thought of making ski's like the one's on the hut in this post? http://www.ofncommunity.com/forums/index.php?showtopic=49443"
537479,Terry,2011-01-10 17:57:00,14456," my hut is nasty trying to pull it I think the runners that were made for it have worn out, don't know what they were made from ( probably brake material)  where can I buy a couple of strips of this UHMW / Hyfax stuff to see if it will help mine maybe I can put it on top of the ones I have on there now and give it more lift and slide"
537484,misfish,2011-01-10 18:26:00,29133,"Terry I found it at mcmaster carr.3/8"" thick,3"" inch wide,5' long,$53 a piece.  http://www.mcmaster.com/#uhmw-polyethylene/=aj5oux   Nylon 6/6, isnt much cheaper."
537488,Roy,2011-01-10 18:34:00,13728,"Someone is always throwing old skis out, wouldn't that work?"
537492,GBW,2011-01-10 18:44:00,8460,I have 2 set's if anyone want's them free.  One set cut down to fit on my clam 2000 but just to lazy to pull the added weight.
537514,irishfield,2011-01-10 19:48:00,26272,"Bass pro should have a set of hyfax runners in stock for a clam Terry $65 or so.... and if it's the same as Frabil you get 4 pieces long enough for most any hut.  You could also source it from P&A Plastics in Hamilton.. it's where I buy my sheet from for aircraft ski bottoms, but I only use 1/8"". Funny it holds up on airplanes landing at 70mph or so... but it didn't last on the bottom of my frabill... must be those portage trails!!"
537534,ch312,2011-01-10 20:09:00,1590,"visit your local snowmobile dealer to get some FREE used slides. each brand of sled uses a different style, i believe yamaha had the best design. heh...best machines too   anyways, i used aluminum rivets to attach 4 of these slides to my yukon tc last winter. makes for much easier pulling, saves the huts floor, and is very durable.  odds are its the same plastic clam is selling in their kits. did i mention they're free from most dealers?"
537539,Terry,2011-01-10 20:15:00,14456, so I guess I should just use the set I have or buying new ones..maybe I can just take the stones out and file the rough spots on the set I have I was hoping there was something better out there...
537665,walleyejigger,2011-01-10 23:51:00,876,"go to the local rink with a timmies, and ask for some old puck board, i have it on my 8'x10' heavy duty hut, works great,"
537668,irishfield,2011-01-10 23:53:00,26272,That remind me.. I have some puck board under the bench.. I'll see what I have Brian/Terry..
537676,misfish,2011-01-11 00:10:00,29133, That be perfect Wayne.Thanks.Im going to also add a sheet ot 1/4 inch plywood to the floor.Makes for a nice flat surface.
537677,GBW,2011-01-11 00:14:00,8460,anyone want the downhill ski's?  LOL
537690,misfish,2011-01-11 00:33:00,29133,  If you lived next door sure.
537699,GBW,2011-01-11 00:48:00,8460,"I may be in Barrie again soon.  If so, I can bring them as a back up (one set) for you Brian."
537702,IndySKS,2011-01-11 00:51:00,134,Another place you might want to look for scrapes of puck board sort of stuff is places that put it in the floor of the boxes or dump trucks and trailers. Im sure they all have some trimmings kicking around
537815,Twocoda,2011-01-11 03:39:00,4130,"krazy carpets, shroons and a micky of C.C.......ohhhhhhhhhhh to be 12 again ..."
537843,fish_fishburn,2011-01-11 05:44:00,1311,Those BELL cable markers work well as runners. I think there made of fiberglass. I have used them for runners with good success
