537172,Terry,2011-01-09 22:03:00,14456,the down look is great  I believe the HDS5 screen is too small for all the features I really believe you need an 8 or 10
537208,aplumma,2011-01-09 23:22:00,6896,I run the hds7 with the LSS=1 module and it is like an Xray below the water. I wish I could put it on all my boats but for now it is on the one I use in big water.  Art

If you want to know anything about them feel free to give me a shout. I have them figured out very nicely right now. I just ordered my Elite 5 "" dsi  for a portable. I also use a HDS-8 as my ice fishing unit. Once you go to these you will never go back. I'm finding structure on lakes I never knew were there. I have even found stuff like a Car on Scugog, Huts on Simcoe and other lakes. I would never find this stuff without LSS-1. Amazing the difference you see with 2d to Structure View."
