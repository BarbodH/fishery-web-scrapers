537524,bare foot wader,2011-01-10 20:02:00,1354,"solid fry up right there!  I read an interesting article a while back that suggest many fish become cannibals once they reach a certain size...something to do with proteins being the same, as compared to non cannibalized prey, and therefore more growth/nutrition..something like that anyways...I think it was a euro researched paper, mainly talking about pike and zander...if i can find it again i'll post it..very interesting read"
