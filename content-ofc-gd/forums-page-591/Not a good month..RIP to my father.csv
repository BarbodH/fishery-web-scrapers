This was weeks after his mother (my grandmother) was told to get her affairs in order since her liver cancer was beyond hope. I can only hope her remaining time is comfortable but this has really been trying on her will to survive. So it is a little quiet around my place and I am dealing with the powers that be in getting everything straightened out. As per my father's request there will be a short visitation with no service this week. Thanks to all who have been so supportive."
