536926,rob v,2011-01-09 04:21:00,535,Enjoyed the premier - it was good to see you with some noteworthy guests... and doing something out of your comfort zone !   Congrats to the Canadian Jr's on a great tourney - tough way to win silver - but well done all the same.
536970,asdve23rveavwa,2011-01-09 12:59:00,2690,"Finally watched the show, recorded it, last night.  Entertaining episode, gotta love musky fishing.  Couple of those ""jump shots"" were fantastic!! Loved the banter between Dave and Pete As for the hockey, enough has been said about that game.  Let's just say, next year's team will have alot of inspiration to win.  They will also have ALOT of pressure on them not to be the team that makes it three years without gold, and on home soil as well."

535298,PikeMolester,2011-01-06 04:16:00,428,Pete is my stinking hero. What I would give to be taken out with the Musky Ninja...
535299,GBW,2011-01-06 04:17:00,8460,"OH HELL NO!!!!  I can't even think of a way to stop you or offer a retaliation right now.  Too many tears in my beer from hockey...  Hell, I think it's just tears in my glass now..."
535302,HTHM,2011-01-06 04:20:00,4082,Enjoyed the musky show and the first two periods. The last one kinda blew....
535332,LucG,2011-01-06 11:45:00,779,Great Show! Can't wait for the next.
535335,superdad,2011-01-06 12:01:00,353,"Isn't a sun screen enough protection from the rays??? You have to go Ninja like too???  The show's format was a change and change is always a good thing, otherwise it becomes a routine.  Nice Boat and the camera is always good.  The cast count was really good- being that the fish of 10,000 casts came better than that.  Cheers  David  aka  Superdad"
535357,Pete Maina,2011-01-06 13:38:00,213,"Sorry to hear the hockey game went poorly at the end.  Glad folks enjoyed the show ... the cast count was a great touch!  Superdad ... yeah, sadly I do need the mask these days. The glare makes me very ill ... too much exposure over the years, apparently, and I've lost my tolerance."
535364,ColdH20guy,2011-01-06 14:12:00,312,awesome show guys..I kind of liked Dave's little fella'! and his figure 8 wasnt too bad either..I dont usually watch a ton of musky shows so it was a nice change..thanks for doing it!  shame about the juniors..I think the whole country will be talking around the water coolers this morning
535378,I'mHooked,2011-01-06 14:52:00,525,"Damn...who said 4-2 ? Best 2 periods of hockey I've seen recently! Shame they stopped playing when it counted.  Nice work out there Davie boy, gotta love chasing those predators with the masters!"
535385,brifishrgy,2011-01-06 15:02:00,559,"Great show Dave, LSC has one great fishery, looking forward to the rest of this seasons episodes  as far as the juniors go"
535399,bubbles,2011-01-06 15:44:00,591,I love Musky  I hate Hockey!
535421,stubbex1,2011-01-06 17:00:00,164,"Great show Dave!  I have always wanted to try casting for LSC musky, its just i live 2 hours away and trolling always seems to produce, I'll have to try it this summer!  I thought the mask was more of a ""stealth"" approach Pete    Too bad for our boys, congrats to the ruskies, was a great tourny!!"
535433,Dave Mercer,2011-01-06 17:38:00,148,Thank you all for your kind words and feedback. Shooting this show with Pete and Shram was and absolute blast and an honor. I can't wait to get out with them again and try whoop on some more of those beasts!
535434,GBW,2011-01-06 17:39:00,8460,but you all need to be wearing the pink hats...
535435,HTHM,2011-01-06 17:43:00,4082,"  Uh, Dave...This could cost you big. TJ is giving out four (4) prize packs. I know you are generous, but..."
535437,bucktail,2011-01-06 17:47:00,1857,Great show.... st Clair has been on my to do list for at least 5 years and watching this reminded me to get it into the rotation of spots for the coming year!  Having Peter Frampton on board is always bonus!!!!
535442,TJQ,2011-01-06 17:59:00,7806, LOL.. umm those 4 prize packs are from me personally and wont be as nice as Daves.... I love you guys... but not that much!! LOL
535444,Smarty Pantz,2011-01-06 18:02:00,203," Was a great show Dave!! When I first started watching I had no idea you guys were catching 'ski's, what a surprise!!!! Always amazing to see those majectic big fish"
535445,GBW,2011-01-06 18:02:00,8460,"awww, I almost shed a tear reading that...  I said ALMOST..."
535483,alphaalpha,2011-01-06 20:28:00,475,"Great way to start off the new season!  Very informative and entertaining show.  The question is did Pete eat your honeybun after he caught that 54""er  ?   -Alphaalpha."
535653,Pete Maina,2011-01-07 01:07:00,213,"I never eat honeybuns ... those things are disgusting, yet they may be better than porkchops for bait. TJ, forgot to comment ... love the pic. Relaxation"
535703,SRT8 smoker craft,2011-01-07 02:40:00,1107," I laughed hard on that one ""I'd be sitting at the back with a honey bun"" LOL great show !!!"
536440,Snowball,2011-01-08 15:01:00,167,"Great show Dave and Guests! I have never fished for muskies but after watching your show I am anxious to give it a try. Just have to find a flour sack.  Regards, Snowball"
536460,kickingfrog,2011-01-08 15:33:00,8333,"Lawrence of Arabia to pink fuzzy hats, Pete sure is on the cutting edge of fashion."
536850,Leecher,2011-01-09 02:11:00,7832,Certainly was a great show    Congrats Dave and Co Leechman

One question..whats with the mask? wind burn is my guess..Or is it just to make ppl like me ask questions?? HA HA HA.. Awesome first show guys! That will be hard to top for the rest of the season..Hey Dave any ice fishing shows in the future?
535119,moose,2011-01-06 00:31:00,266,great show  tonight really liked the intro to the show. great guy met him a couple of times. really interesting that dave didnt do all the talking pete and shram both gave tips on how to fish and what to fish for baits really like the fishing mask might have to pull one out for flyin trip this yr
535120,farsider,2011-01-06 00:31:00,456,"Dave, PM, and Musky.  Nice.  Now, only 12 more episodes of Musky to come.   (I hope)  Cheers,  Mark"
535121,skinny,2011-01-06 00:32:00,442,hey love the show on skis. nice Christmas decorations on the end of the line. Man I bet those skis fight hard. Can't wait for the rest of the season. Great show Dave and all the people behind getting it done.
535122,Cosmos,2011-01-06 00:33:00,588,The new show was pretty interested. I really like that fact that show was longer and commercial was much shorter. Really nice addition is gear reviews in the end of the show. Thank you Mr Dave.
535124,Rod Caster,2011-01-06 00:35:00,5784,Some people are spoiled enough to be able to fish places like Lake St-Clair....I'm spoiled enough to watch them from my couch!!! Good for some chuckles and jealousy after long days at work...thx.  Go Visentin Go!! make Canada proud.  
535125,bigmac1984,2011-01-06 00:36:00,193,"Great show, love that lake.  I fish lake st. clair quite a bit, mostly for Bass, and fish Muskie late fall, but may try in the summer now after seeing the size of some of those.  Having Pete Maina on board definately helps.  Now on to the main event, Canada vs. Russia..... I predict another beating like game 1  Good luck boys  "
535135,SRT8 smoker craft,2011-01-06 00:56:00,1107,Good job guys I have only seen a few mins so far and it was great can't wait to watch the whole episode I PVRed it.
535140,TJQ,2011-01-06 01:06:00,7806,Great show Dave and Pete!! I think another Maina fashion statement was made!!
535147,danbouck,2011-01-06 01:14:00,4380,"Great show Dave, one of the best episodes to date!"
535149,SBCregal,2011-01-06 01:15:00,688,great show guys! lots of good tips and info.  ryan
535156,Smarty Pantz,2011-01-06 01:22:00,203,"Wow WoW WOW.....that was a totally awesome show Dave!!!! Great job on bringin' in the ski's  Holy smokes that last one that Pete caught was a monster. My daughter heard me going ""OMG, OMG"" and when she got out of the bath, she came running down to see it LoL.  /me saunters over to her facebook page   Once again, love the show!!!!   █♥█ GO CANADA GO █♥█"
535163,Pete Maina,2011-01-06 01:36:00,213,"Hi,  Happy New Year! So how'd we do? The Ninja  Had a great time with Dave and Schram ... certainly never a dull moment with Dave. I have to say I was very sad though, that I'd forgotten to bring the pink hat. WOuld have been awesome with the Ninja Mask.  Thanks all!"
535168,mercman,2011-01-06 01:45:00,7054,hey Pete !! love the ninja look. Hope to get out for Muskie in the spring with Roy.It'll be my first.Couldnt help noticing Dave has the same gear i just got for christmas.Maybe thats a good omen  Happy new year Pete !!!   Paul
535174,Pete Maina,2011-01-06 01:54:00,213,"Very cool Paul!   Lucky bugger getting to fish with Roy. I expect those things are all good Omens. My wife Esther just got back from the exercise class she teaches (I know everyone is surprised I wasn't there   ) ... DVR'd the show, so I can brag to her about catching a fish"
535175,Gregoire,2011-01-06 01:59:00,1397,"Great to see two of the best and most knowledgeable fisherman on one show. Was funny to see Dave bugger so much at the beginning, but it was all in good fun. Love to musky show, just wish I had the opportunity to fish St. Clair. I also thought that there was a lot of good tips shared on the show. I always thought that musky being solitary creatures was a bit of  a myth, especially in the summer."
535178,Handlebarz,2011-01-06 02:08:00,3790,Great show guys it was a blast I sure do love the cast count it shows others that just because you have two great musky fishermen on the boat it still takes a lot of work. After Dave and Ryan get out for some more musky action they will learn that shakers dont count unless the kiddies are on the boat  So Pete when does your version of the show come out with dave taking you out bass fishing you could always add some vampire teeth to the bass before putting them on camera after all vampires are in according to my daughter.  All kidding aside great show cheers
535183,GBW,2011-01-06 02:16:00,8460,"DAMN SKIPPY!!! What a night!  Musky with Dave, Pete and Shram (no teeth marks and I set the hook too - Dave) and Visentin is kicking   in net for Canada.  Is this heaven?"
535187,Dutch,2011-01-06 02:22:00,831,"Sorry, didn't catch the show as I don't get WFN.  I really like the previous shows and from the comments here, can't wait to see the replay when we finally get WFN."
535250,GBW,2011-01-06 03:25:00,8460,"someone delete my last post, maybe it will change the outcome and Canada will win the gold..."
535260,TJQ,2011-01-06 03:34:00,7806, LOL.. nope were gonna leave it there for ever..... Im gonna see if i can hack in and change your status to that...
