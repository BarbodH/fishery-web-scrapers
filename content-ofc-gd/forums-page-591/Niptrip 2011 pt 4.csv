Being the rookie and relegated to the top bunk I found it somewhat stifling.  Also, for the first few hours in the bungaloo, we had no snow and our holes would slowly start to ice-over.  A small fan would have pushed that warm air enough to keep the holes open until the snow fell and they could be mounded.  There’s also the human production of methane gas and smoke from the breakfast fry-up to consider. A chorus of snoring, the heat of the top bunk, and my ever-increasingly harsh headache kept me up the first night,   so I fished.   I didn’t catch anything until first light, and by then the other boys were rousing.  John’s famous for his breakfast and he cooked us up a feast that helped us all feel better.      The second day was basically a replay of the first with enough action to keep us well into the fishin’.  Our party-hardy neighbours had left for home in Hamilton (after they lost the bet to us for most ‘eyes iced).  Good dudes.                             TBC..."
