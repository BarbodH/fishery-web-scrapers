537379,rfmcrx,2011-01-10 12:22:00,42,Just wondering if anyone has fished big east lake on the 118 between bracebridge and canarvan? Wondering how the bite is and what fish are in the lake ?
537399,SmokestackLightnin,2011-01-10 13:56:00,390,"Big East is a ""Put and Take"" 12 month less one day splake fishery.  There is also bass in the open water season.  You can walk to some of the fishing areas but typically we take the sleds and head off to the quieter part of the lake.  Fish the splake like specs and you will have success."
537591,rfmcrx,2011-01-10 21:43:00,42,Thanks for the info. Im taking my brother out there on sunday for his first time ice fishing. I have never fished the lake before and heard there was splake in it.
