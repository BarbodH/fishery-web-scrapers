538363,bobowski,2011-01-12 13:41:00,360,I am planning a ice fishing trip with the guys for some time in February. Does anyone have any recomendations on a good lake with accomodations close by. Im looking for anywhere within 3 hours north of Toronto. We are not particular on the species of fish but just want some consistent fishing. Any input would be much apprieciated. Thanks
