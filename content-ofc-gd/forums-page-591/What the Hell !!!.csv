537954,GBW,2011-01-11 15:12:00,8460,I never thought I would ever read a blog on WFN on how to SNAG a fish! WFN Blog
537965,Pikeslayer,2011-01-11 15:26:00,1443, Yeppir. That's redneck fishing for ya   . Right up there with 'noodlin' for catfish. I am somewhat shocked that that is allowed to posted on the WFN site. I clicked on 'report abuse' and the item was 'flagged'. Also saw your comment but I don't think laytoncc really gives a hoot.
537966,TJQ,2011-01-11 15:29:00,7806,hes from Il.. and its say in the regs.. 
537968,GBW,2011-01-11 15:31:00,8460,I can’t believe they allow snagging there…
537969,Roy,2011-01-11 15:59:00,13728,"We can't really call it snagging.....the title calls it ""snaging"".  I guess you don't need the big, extra deluxe diploma to be an ambassador eh?"
537970,SBCregal,2011-01-11 15:59:00,688,"seeing as how its legal there, maybe your comment on the site there should be removed?"
537974,danbouck,2011-01-11 16:08:00,4380, It went downhill fast on there.
537975,GBW,2011-01-11 16:08:00,8460,"It won't let me.  And, he said catfish not salmon."
537979,danjang,2011-01-11 16:14:00,148,"He mentioned Mississippi river. It's probably legal there too. As for the lake Michigan snagging, it would appear that you have to take the fish home. I don't see anything wrong with taking fish using that method if you are going to take it home if it's legal. Clearly that law was not designed for sport fishermen. Only for those who want to bring home some meat to their family."
537982,ADB,2011-01-11 16:17:00,444, Oh dear... Let the debate begin.
537983,GBW,2011-01-11 16:17:00,8460,"TJ, Roy or any others can kill this post cause it's legal there and I didn't think it would be legal anywhere..."
537989,mercman,2011-01-11 16:28:00,7054,"  Don't sweat it buddy. I find it a bit unsportsman like myself. For me personally, it would take all the fun outta fsihin."
537991,hammercarp,2011-01-11 16:30:00,964,"All sorts of ""alternative methods"" are allowed in the states. Snagging is just one. You can shoot spawning pike with a gun in Vermont.  Spear fishing and I mean with a spear gun with or without scuba gear."
538018,solopaddler,2011-01-11 17:58:00,8605,According to the regs TJ posted what he did was illegal.  The Mississipi river is not lake Michigan and catfish aren't salmon.

From the Illinois fishing regulations 2010. It would appear that indiscriminate snagging is legal there since it's really hard to selectively snag. I don't think what he did was illegal. As for it being ethical as a SPORT fisherman. No. But I am accustomed to different laws. Some might even find the laws here in Ontario as equally what the hell."
538026,TJQ,2011-01-11 18:29:00,7806, Somehwere theres a video of them shooting them with old 303's.... man... lol.. i dunno...  and   seems like they are encouraging getting rid of carp etc...
538027,GBW,2011-01-11 18:32:00,8460,"like I said, this can be deleted or locked as I don't see any good coming from it."

538035,aplumma,2011-01-11 18:48:00,6896,"Snagging is usually done on course fish like shad,carp,gar and bowfin. Since he was bragging about a catfish he snagged which is illegal it must be treated just as any fish caught OOS or illegally and returned to the water in a timely manner. The act of snagging is really no different than using gill nets as far as the control of what fish that you catch. Down here we also gig frogs, use impound nets for Stripers,noodling for catfish and gill net for gizzard shad. All of them are legal and in their place a tool to harvest the fish from the waters. Some of the methods are more regional like harvesting alligators and Nutra all are done using traps and guns in the South. If we looked at the way bears are hunted up North we could shock someone from the South and the Southern traditions of coon hunting would appall a lot of folks up North. These type of posts taken from the area were it is considered normal and brought to light in places were it is strange will sometimes offend the people where it is not common.   Art"
