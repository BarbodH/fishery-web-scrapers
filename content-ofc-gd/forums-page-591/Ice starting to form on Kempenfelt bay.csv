538203,Rizzo,2011-01-12 00:53:00,4754,The last couple of days I've seen a guy ice fishing out near Centennial Beach a few hundred feet out from shore. I think there's a wreck down there?

538226,Rizzo,2011-01-12 01:11:00,4754,"I would agree with the ""crazy"" assessment. There's only been ice there a few days, and in some areas not far from where he is it still looks wet!"
