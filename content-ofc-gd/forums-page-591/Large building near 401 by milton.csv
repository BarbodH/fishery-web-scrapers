537469,bucktail,2011-01-10 17:09:00,1857,Yep biosolids from poop plants. They store it there for when they cant apply it to the fields.

537515,mercman,2011-01-10 19:48:00,7054,"  SKEETS.....JUST DID A SEARCH ON GOOGLE AND FROM WHAT I SEE, ITS WHERE THE DISINFECT YOUR SHORTS !!!  BUT THE ONE ON THE FAR EAST SIDE IS A MISSLE SILO"
537743,kickingfrog,2011-01-11 02:03:00,8333,"Come on guys, if we're gonna' talk missile silos...  http://www.680news.com/news/local/article/166217--beer-vat-convoy-continues-its-hamilton-toronto-journey-next-stop-mississauga  http://images.ctv.ca/archives/CTVNews/img2/20110110/600_beer_vats_110110_430241.jpg?2"
537746,mercman,2011-01-11 02:11:00,7054,"  Ya i like the way they cleverly disguised them.If you look closely, you can see the tips of the ICBM's inside.I mean really, who do they think they are fooling"
537890,aplumma,2011-01-11 12:39:00,6896,two words    Area 51  Art
537129,mercman,2011-01-09 20:26:00,7054,  BIO degradable ICBM's But ya didnt hear that from me...ok
537141,HTHM,2011-01-09 20:49:00,4082,"I used to work at those buildings off the 407 G, They are sludge lagoon covers, as in human waste that is pumped into the ground as fertilizer."
537142,Billy Bob,2011-01-09 20:50:00,5865, ICBM are usually in silo's but I doubt that's what it is..they would NOT be in a major populated area.
537143,Gerritt,2011-01-09 20:51:00,6129,"Albert,  I liked armies of pigmen, ICBM's and grow ops better....  Bet is smells like crap there..."
537145,Billy Bob,2011-01-09 20:52:00,5865, I don't know the area in question...but by looking at these pics I would place a medium wager that it's a sewer treatment plant.
537146,Billy Bob,2011-01-09 20:54:00,5865, They would float if you take off the screen doors....  :rofl2:
537149,HTHM,2011-01-09 20:57:00,4082,"Actually it is not that bad. A very sharp odor, but better than chicken waste."
537150,irishfield,2011-01-09 20:58:00,26272,...should have been a dead give away G... being right beside a river and all !!
537154,mercman,2011-01-09 21:02:00,7054,"  Hey Bob ........where do you see any major populations. We tried putting them in our subs, but the SCREEN doors kept getting in the way"
537155,Gerritt,2011-01-09 21:03:00,6129,"You think Wayne? if Albert is correct and they are pumping it into the ground, I would assume there would be leeching... think I will avoid eating anything from Bronte Creek....  G"
537156,Gerritt,2011-01-09 21:04:00,6129,  and I know what Chicken poop smells like!! seeing as the house in Caledonia was right beside one!
537158,Big Cliff,2011-01-09 21:10:00,6899, You lived right beside the Chicken Ranch? Lucky you!!!!
537161,irishfield,2011-01-09 21:14:00,26272,I use to move chickens from the raising barn to the egg laying pens for a girlfriends sister back in the '70's. My mother would be waiting for me with a garden hose before I could get in the back door!!
537164,HTHM,2011-01-09 21:37:00,4082,"Whatta ya mean IF?!   Yes it is pumped into the ground, very carefully, and in agriculural applications only. No diff that spreading manure. Google biosolids and you will get a better understanding."
537173,Grimace,2011-01-09 22:11:00,2020,16 mile creek.
537180,Gerritt,2011-01-09 22:29:00,6129,"thank you Grimace, my mistake."
537301,Cast-Away,2011-01-10 02:57:00,790,Milton is a new incinerator and the 407 domes are oil storage away from the refinery in Oakville.
537308,Gerritt,2011-01-10 03:03:00,6129,"ok so far we have pigmen, ICBM's, grow op, greenhouse, sewage treatment and oil storage...  :stretcher:"
537313,Grimace,2011-01-10 03:11:00,2020,Hey Gerritt.   I just flew over the place in a helicopter.  The roof was ripped and I saw Cheech Marin pretending to swim on top of a ladder.   Pretty sure it is a grow op.  Lol.
537316,irishfield,2011-01-10 03:14:00,26272,
537320,Gerritt,2011-01-10 03:16:00,6129,

537325,HTHM,2011-01-10 03:26:00,4082,Gerrit it is a sewage facility.
537328,mercman,2011-01-10 03:33:00,7054,  thats what THEY want us to believe.  but its ICBM's.....
537329,Gerritt,2011-01-10 03:33:00,6129,  Priceless!!! and booooobies! LOL surprised youtube allowed it!
536934,kickingfrog,2011-01-09 04:55:00,8333,"Anybody know what it is? It has 5 or 6 ""silo like"" tubes facing the hwy."
536936,ADB,2011-01-09 04:57:00,444, Ha.  I've been wondering that too.
536937,Grimace,2011-01-09 05:02:00,2020,Gas powered generating station.  If you are talking about just east of Milton on the north side.  edit typo
536949,fishing n autograph,2011-01-09 10:52:00,2540,"Yup, new power plant for the west end of the GTA...."
536980,kickingfrog,2011-01-09 14:02:00,8333,A quick search on the net turned up zilch... except for two other people asking about it. The collective is good. Thanks guys.
537008,mercman,2011-01-09 14:56:00,7054,ICBM's  
537015,kickingfrog,2011-01-09 15:13:00,8333," Na, those are all in submarines."
537037,fishing n autograph,2011-01-09 15:57:00,2540,Canada has a submarine? Does it float and did we buy is second hand?
537038,mercman,2011-01-09 16:00:00,7054,"Good place to keep a sub. With a few trolling holes, you could launch it in the lakes and do some lake trout fishing"
537039,kickingfrog,2011-01-09 16:00:00,8333, You do get the general idea of a submarine don't you?
537041,mercman,2011-01-09 16:05:00,7054, Of course it doesnt float !!!! Its a canadian sub !!!!
537096,Gerritt,2011-01-09 19:42:00,6129,"Here is a question, perfect thread for it!  What are the weird dome shaped buildings near the 407?"
537099,ADB,2011-01-09 19:48:00,444, Where on the 407?  Near the 401?
537100,fishing n autograph,2011-01-09 19:49:00,2540,Probably the 407s salt stash
537103,Gerritt,2011-01-09 19:52:00,6129,"These are  very low profile, and look like the panels are  made from glass there are several of them I am thinking 8 they almost look like biodomes?... if I remember correctly they are near regional road 25  there is an area in between with pipes etc... like to refuel a tanker or something?  G"
537105,Grimace,2011-01-09 19:56:00,2020,"That would be near Neyagawa in Oakville area.  I do not know, but like Gerrit said they are super low profile. I have not seen buildings quite like them.  I thought maybe some new wave greenhouses or something."
537106,Gerritt,2011-01-09 19:58:00,6129,Here is a image from google earth...    closer shot...   G
537112,fishing n autograph,2011-01-09 20:08:00,2540,That's where they're doing experiments with the pigmen...a whole super race....an army of pigmen!
537113,Gerritt,2011-01-09 20:09:00,6129,yup between Bronte and Neyagawa.
537114,mercman,2011-01-09 20:11:00,7054,Nope.....ICBM's
537118,Gerritt,2011-01-09 20:12:00,6129,LOL
537119,Gerritt,2011-01-09 20:17:00,6129,FnA... I think it is grow op....
537121,Carp,2011-01-09 20:19:00,1488,"I actually had to drive into the facility once (work related) at 407 & regional road 25. I can't remember the exact terminology used to describe the buildings, but it sounded like ""biosphere"" or ""biodome"". One of those ""BIO"" things !!!"
537124,Carp,2011-01-09 20:21:00,1488,LOL !!!  Yup ! Looks like a giant grow op.
537126,fishing n autograph,2011-01-09 20:22:00,2540, Yeah you know you love the Seinfeld quotes!
