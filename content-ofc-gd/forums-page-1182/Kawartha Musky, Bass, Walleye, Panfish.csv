92709,Rich,2007-07-11 01:04:00,3927,"Sleded and I headed up early Friday morning to one of our favourite areas of the kawarthas for some multi-species action. We were not let down.  A look at the drive up.    I've been dying for musky since last September, so thats how we started. Within 6 casts, I had my first. For some reason we never got a still picture of it, just video. It was not a legal fish and I barely took it out of the water.  About 10 more casts and I was into a nicer one, probably legal, but he shook the hook. We were simply casting spinnerbaits along a distinct weedline, about 8-10ft of water.  After that, the muskies apparently shut down.  We tossed grubs looking for walleye, and as expected, got into a bunch of panfish (which were released).      We spent the rest of the day just relaxing, tossing grubs and casting spinnerbaits for bass. Nothing major that day but still lots of fun on the water.      Day 2 started with a bang.  My BBR sense was tingling at the thought of trolling for musky. We've never really done it before, but I gotta tell ya, I think I'm hooked. After not even an hour I hooked into the big fish of the trip. No, not that big, but a long, skinny kawartha musky. We didn't even take the time to measure it. Not long after the catch she swam off, full of life.    Soon after, I was into another one. A little smaller but I'm pretty sure it was a legal fish.    After that it was Sleded's turn to land a little snot rocket. Not exactly that trophy he was after but hey, he was spunky and full of life.    After that we chased the walleye. Once again, no big trophies, but jigging the weedlines with the trusty orange grub did pick up a few good eaters.    And of course, some panfish.      Who can forget the perch who annihilated my 5 inch senko, lol    A fine Kawartha sunset ended the day.      We didn't get much time to fish on day 3. Long story short, a couple decent bass, one tiny musky (for me), and a bunch o' panfish. Oh yeah, one little walleye too. Sleded scored with the big bass of the trip.          It was a great trip, full of lots of fun times and great laughs. Sure the fish weren't massive, or necessarily co-operative at times, but it happens.  Looking forward to the next trip up!"
