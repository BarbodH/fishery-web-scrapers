92436,tonyb,2007-07-10 14:02:00,1637,It's been a while and I don't know about you guys but I have a craving for some hot wings and cold beer.
92441,John,2007-07-10 14:07:00,2956,Absolutely..........I'm in. However Tuesdays are bad for me (before 8.30) until mid August.
92461,ccmtcanada,2007-07-10 14:30:00,7971,"Depends on where it is....but hey, why not?  As long as it doesn't interfere with fishing I'm good to go...LOL"
92466,John,2007-07-10 14:36:00,2956,  Usually the Firehall in Bronte Cliff. Not sure if there is anything doing off the shore there this time of year?
92470,nautifish,2007-07-10 14:42:00,1416,Well i'm having a fish fry at my place next month ur all welcome here if u like.....lol
92472,ccmtcanada,2007-07-10 14:44:00,7971, I'll stay tuned for details then!  That's only about a hour from me.  As far as off shore...not much action off Lake O...but the Kawarthas are only a half hour away....hehe.
92506,bigbuck,2007-07-10 16:09:00,2449,"If it's at the Firehall, I'll try to make it out this time. It seems that every time there was one, one of the kids decided not to feel well so dear old dad had to stay home. I'd love to put some more faces to all the handles."

92576,Carmen,2007-07-10 19:09:00,72,"Not quite sure what a swill is but have only been on the board for a couple of months and up to trying anything once, plus being a new daddy only 20 days ago I can use the excuse."
92587,John,2007-07-10 19:34:00,2956," Beer, chicken wings and good conversation Brookster................"
92589,motv8tr,2007-07-10 19:44:00,2587,"As much as I would love to, my bed time for the summer is around 8:00pm so you'll have to count me out again   One of these days...  Maureen"
92590,John,2007-07-10 19:45:00,2956, Come down for a sleep over Maureen.......
92592,tonyb,2007-07-10 19:46:00,1637,"Either you are getting out early fishing everyday, or are WAY older than I think you are  The streetlights aren't even on yet at 8pm!  Tony"
92596,motv8tr,2007-07-10 19:55:00,2587," You going to send someone up to house sit for me???     Sadly not fishing, work.   ..I get up at 2am...and somedays I feel way older than I am  Maureen"

92683,Rizzo,2007-07-10 23:51:00,4754,"Geez there's a lot of people who are ""in"" without even knowing when it is...wish I had that kind of a schedule!"
92704,Carp,2007-07-11 00:58:00,1488," Maybe a bit slow from shore, but just a few kilometres out, there's world class salmon and trout fishing Cliff.  I'm always willing to get together with my brothers and sisters from the OFC Community. Not always able though. If work or other commitments don't get in the way, I'm there. Just pick a date."
93327,John,2007-07-12 14:29:00,2956, Usually Tuesday nights (half price wing night)...........
93340,Fishnfiend,2007-07-12 14:55:00,357,"I'm in.  The last mini-swill I attended ended up with a fantastic evening of salmon fishing with Tony. Yes, they are generally on Tuesdays as the wings are half price.  Now, if only we could get beer at half price."
93362,Gerritt,2007-07-12 15:35:00,6129,Count me in for this one.  Set a date.   Gerritt.
93423,terry71,2007-07-12 18:34:00,21,"Hey Tony, remember me? If you are the same Tony, count me in. I bought the rods and reels off you in the winter. I have been salmon fishing out on the lake the past five weeks. Fishing has been really good. Could have used some extra bodies to help land and fight fish some of those days. The fishing was so crazy. All tahat was missing was beers and girls.(lol) Anyways, I'm going out again this weekend off of either Bowmanville, Whitby, Bluffer's or Port Credit. It all depends on reports from my friends.  Take care,  Terry  P.S., let me know where the ""swill"" will be."
93426,bowshep,2007-07-12 18:53:00,378,Ok thats about 25 People. Where when. Peace Ken
93430,tonyb,2007-07-12 19:01:00,1637,"Hey Terry71, yes I remember you.  How are the wire outfits working out for you?  I'm guessing that you have already broken them in  Here's a link to the Poll - http://www.ofncommunity.com/forums/index.php?showtopic=9232  Tony"
