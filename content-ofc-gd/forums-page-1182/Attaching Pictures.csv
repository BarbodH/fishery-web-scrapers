93257,Letpikego,2007-07-12 05:20:00,29,Thanks
93258,Letpikego,2007-07-12 05:40:00,29,Does not work.  All of these methods tell me the file is too large
93277,lunkerbasshunter,2007-07-12 10:30:00,2585,i think the pics need to be less then 250kb
93330,Mike Pike,2007-07-12 14:32:00,1332,Try e-mailing the pictures to yourself.  They will be re-sized to a smaller file size and you can use those.
