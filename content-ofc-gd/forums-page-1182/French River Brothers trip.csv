We will be there this coming weekend.  Will probably fish some at the mouth on Nippissing around Sandy Island also.  Any fishing tips or reports? Thanks, Don"

93289,Bcee,2007-07-12 11:56:00,25,"At the mouth of the French there are 2 islands, Fishermans and Blueberry, always some good eye fishing in between the islands.  Mark the channel buoy...you'll see some anchored there.  Some deep holes.  Also, behind Keystone Lodge, through Gibraltar pass but before Canoe Pass you'll see Marshy Bay, lots of rock and weed.  Great Bass and Pike fishing.  Good Luck!"
93323,addy79,2007-07-12 14:15:00,573,"I just came back from Casa Blanca Lodge, loved it, Brian is AWESOME. the boats they provide were great! the cabins were nice. unfortunately, the fishing was a little sub standard but i think that was mostly due to some  bad weather while we were up there.  to be honest, the most success we heard of was right near the lodge fishing the points and islands for walleye.  I had a follow from a 30lb muskie fishing the bay where are boats were docked, we also had luck in there for largemouth, come to think of it, we had most of our success right in front of our cabin!!  we trolled all the way to the mouth of Nippising with little successs (couple pike) however, after speaking to some locals in the area they swear by the area where casa blanca lodge is at.  Make sure to hit 5 mile bay, we marked TONES of fish. Its pretty much all crown land around there, so the scenery is great. Brian will tell you how to get there.  ***make sure to bring a compass with you - everything looks the same on the french from eye level, and its EASY to get lost - trust me!!***  let me know how it goes, adnd let me know if you need any more info."
93439,DonC,2007-07-12 19:27:00,36,"Thanks all for the good wishes and advice. Addy, we will check out the fishing there at the lodge. We are also targeting the other areas as well mentioned by Daplumma, and bcee. Appreciate Rich's sentiments. Thanks and good fishing to all, DonC"
