And lots of carp stuff, oh did l say it was cheep. Line and 3 spinners for 16 bucks, say what you want but the line is strong and the spinners are better looking the Mepps. You also might want to look at his floats some wierd stuff their like controled suspention stuff or another one for bottom bouncing loke l said wierd.

But I find they work as well and a lot cheaper.  I bought some 2kg breaking strength line last week too to go with the pole, it is 0.14 mm. Pretty good size for that breaking strength. Will be back for that 0.085mm line later and a few more pole floats. Fishing for minnow can be fun when carp are not biting."
