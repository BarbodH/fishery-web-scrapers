93508,lunkerbasshunter,2007-07-13 00:31:00,2585,this time of year and with all the humdity we have had the last few days its no surprise.  strong wind coming over the great lakes can produce small little cells like this in no time.  Glad you made it back to shore safely.  Cheers!

93572,POLLIWOGG,2007-07-13 05:35:00,835,"It came through here around 10, If my buddy is was on schedule he would have been in the middle of L.O. headed for one of the 1000 isl. about a half hour ahead of it with just enough time to get ashore pitch a tent and watch it blow away.  If he was ahead of schedule and I think he was he might still have a tent if he got enough beer in it to hold it down..  If he was behind schedule, hopefully he's home in bed and leaving in the  morning."
