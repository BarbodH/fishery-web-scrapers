92905,keepinitreel,2007-07-11 14:55:00,15,"This fish was caught opening day for muskie on lake st. clair, gave a great fight and was released. She was 48"" and very fat. The bite was off that day for just about everyone else from what I hear. Does anyone know how they are biting now i will be going up there this weekend. Oh yeah the blood is mine and not hers.     It was so nice to see her swim away, to hopefully be caught (by me ) again  Keepinitreel"

93219,Mike the Pike,2007-07-12 02:36:00,3421,Now thats a well fed Muskie.WTG
93251,Rich,2007-07-12 04:51:00,3927,Now that's a muskie! Nice!
93261,English,2007-07-12 06:22:00,90,"Hi great Muskie, I have seen them to 36lb, we don't really measure the length here we just weigh them. It wasn't mine my biggest is about 12lb guess didn't have any scales that day. I have caught a lot of pike over the years but the biguns seem to come mostly when fishing for other species so they end up biting you off."
93297,Zib,2007-07-12 12:30:00,369,That's a beauty! Did you catch her trolling or casting?  The musky have been hitting good the past week or so. You can check out the forums on the following link to get some more reports. http://www.lscn2.net/forums/index.php?showforum=5
93512,keepinitreel,2007-07-13 00:38:00,15,here are some other release shots thanks rizzo 
93516,Guest Johnny Bass,2007-07-13 00:48:00,0,Lake St. Clair sure has some amazing Musky fishing. I've only been there once when I was alot inexperienced and only caught 1 or 2 smallies. The MNR was doing a survey and came by to ask me how I was doing. Well he got an ear full!   Poor guy.lol
