93446,Popr,2007-07-12 19:50:00,7,Hi everyone:  Just wondering if anyone has fished and camped on Dollar Lake. Its located east of Grundy Lake Prov Park and just north on hwy 522. I'm planning to take my son there camping and was wondering if it worth the time and effort. Any information would be helpful.  Thanks for your time.  popr
