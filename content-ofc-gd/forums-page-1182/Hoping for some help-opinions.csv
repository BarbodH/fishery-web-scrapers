What I am looking for is some advice on different sites. here are some of the criteria.  It needs to be 2-3 hours tops from Toronto, have somethings to keep the kids (18, 13, 3)/non fisher people entertained nearby besides the usual camp site stuff, and if at all possible as we will probably not have a chance to rent a boat to hold the six of us, good shorefishing or a smaller lake where we could rent a canoe or two (bass, walleye, muskie, pike prefered but I'm not picky).  Any help or advice would be greatly appreciated and just up front Bass lake, Mara and sibbald point are out as we have already been and would like to try something new. Thanks in advance for any help."
