93216,aniceguy,2007-07-12 02:22:00,1094,Home depot or Rona will sell a carpet that will do the trick.

93227,addict,2007-07-12 02:46:00,475,homedepot stuff works well and its fairly cheap.last about 2-3 seasons uncovered.cover or store indoors and it should last.
93233,silvio,2007-07-12 02:57:00,433,whats this homedepot stuff just normal carpet?
93234,FishFinder,2007-07-12 02:58:00,481,"I think its just outdoor carpet, it does the job but as mentioned it only lasts a couple of seasons and catches hooks alot easier"
93424,terry71,2007-07-12 18:38:00,21,"It is called marine carpet. You can pick it up at most Home Depots. Make sure when you install it, you glue it and staple it. I re-did my princecraft five years ago, still looks brand new.  Terry"
