92808,little angler,2007-07-11 05:00:00,128,just wondering which lake you prefer to fish on personally.
92811,motv8tr,2007-07-11 06:51:00,2587,"No preferance for me...what ever lake I can get on in the favorite for the day  Honestly I don't have a favorite, haven't fished enough to have one.  Maureen"
92840,lunkerbasshunter,2007-07-11 11:41:00,2585,my favorite area to fish is the south bay of lake nipissing.  I do enjoy the muskoka lakes and ahmic lake(not cause of fishing but scenery) in parry sound.  i think the list can go on and on lol
92846,BITEME,2007-07-11 11:55:00,1969,LAKE ONTARIO and all connecting tributaries
92851,Tacklebuster,2007-07-11 12:07:00,303,"Simcoe and Couch., and pretty much any lake I can launch my boat."
92852,Mike the Pike,2007-07-11 12:12:00,3421,The Bay of Quinte good fishing and easy Navigation.MTP
92857,Stoty,2007-07-11 12:22:00,2910,"Pretty much whatever lake has bass!  Top 3  1) Clear/Stoney Lake 2) Rice Lake 3) Percy Boom (Campbellford, Lake Ontario)"
92859,Zib,2007-07-11 12:27:00,369,"Lake St. Clair with out a doubt. No other lake out there that you have the best chance at catching a trophy musky, pike, smallmouth, carp, or walleye all in the same day."
92861,Fly Me In Scotty,2007-07-11 12:28:00,34,Right now I am loving lake erie. But it changes depending on the bite
92864,Hookset,2007-07-11 12:35:00,367,Secluded Muskoka back lakes for Bassin' are my faves.  - no Seadoo's - no people - no line ups / arguments at the boat launch. - no noise - no litter  Pure Heaven...........   Hookset.
92956,Rizzo,2007-07-11 17:07:00,4754,"I'm with hookset...we're on a secluded lake near Parry Sound, but I'm always looking for other spots.  If only I could find a secluded musky lake up there (and the time to fish it) I'd be all set."
92975,bbog,2007-07-11 17:38:00,665,"What hookset said - but add with ""biting fish"""
92993,bassmaster4,2007-07-11 18:02:00,801,this isnt a lake but i spend 95% of my fishing time on the grand river
92994,bassmaster4,2007-07-11 18:02:00,801,this isnt a lake but i spend 95% of my fishing time on the grand river
93000,Canuck2fan,2007-07-11 18:20:00,1444,Seasonal dependant. Fall through Spring any trib on Huron. June till end of July Lake Erie..... Anytime during the summer and early fall rivers around here for bass.
93007,addy79,2007-07-11 18:35:00,573,"gotta go with the backcountry lakes around parry sound. Peace, quiet, tranquility, and unpressured oblivious bass!!!  Rizzo, still looking for a backcountry lake with other species as well, so far I've only found largies and the occasional smallie."
93090,jediangler,2007-07-11 21:17:00,1923,"My favourite is any lake I haven't yet fished. Followed by any lake that I haven't fished since last year. Because I like quiet (no gas motors) I frequent the conservation areas quite a bit. This year, for conservation areas, I've fished Kelso, Mountsberg, Orangeville, Guelph and Valens. Other than that I've fished Sturgeon, Pigeon and Eugenia. And lastly my home river, the Grand. I could never understand why golfers would get a club membership, rather than golf a new course every time. I guess that's how I look at fishing holes."
93096,addict,2007-07-11 21:24:00,475,ones with fish and plenty of them preferably gullable ones.
93100,Motorhead,2007-07-11 21:26:00,163,Whatever Lake or River is on the agenda for the day...  That would be my favourite... If I had to pick one lake over another I`d have to go with lake X...  Doug
93105,fishdawg,2007-07-11 21:30:00,912,"Ive got 2, well maybe 3 i guess  SW section of Lake Ontario - been fishing since ive been 5 & it holds many species & lots of trophy potential & there is lotsa water to share with everyone and ive got a handful of launches to choose from within 20 mintues or so  Kawartha Tri-Lakes - have a trailer up there & have been gaining much confidence up there for most species  Bay Of Quinte ( can count it as Lake O if you want) - never had a walleye skunk there in all my trips (spring or fall) and have broken and reset a few Pbs there - havent made any trips yet specifically for bass or pike, but plan to someday"
93205,Bear,2007-07-12 01:59:00,106,"really enjoy the Mississippi, here in Ontario,(not USA) lake and river sections Nipissing was great last winter"
