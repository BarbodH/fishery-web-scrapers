92734,bucktail,2007-07-11 01:54:00,1857,The Vothman and I hit our favorite 4 lake chain of portage lakes on saturday for some bass and musky action. The fishng started off slow in the first 2 lakes until we hit the 3rd. most of my fish came on a white tandem mag spinnerbait and a PopR. Chris was being brave and fishng a swamp rat over matted vegetation with the usual fun and lack of hooking percentage. He would have beat me if it wasnt for the crappy percentage of the frog. Overall we caught 53 largemouths and No muskies....strange. Biggest fish was a 4.5 pounder 20 incher I landed on a Komanchi Wizzle Worm on a fallen tree. Overall a great day but it reminded me I am not young anymore and my back was toast the next day.        Darren

92738,Joey,2007-07-11 02:00:00,9122,Great report Darren.  Nice Bass  I hear ya about the back thing.  I'm painting the stairs right now and all that hunching over has taken its toll.  Guess we're not as young as we'd like to think we are  Joey

93236,addict,2007-07-12 03:00:00,475,i fished a portage chain of lakes north of kaladar yrs ago with similar results nice job boys.
93249,bucktail,2007-07-12 04:46:00,1857,We decided to keep count this time. I beat Chrissy 34 to 19 but he should have beat me if it wasnt for the poor hooking percentage of the grass frog. I am back up there in a week and a half looking for my elusize 8 pounder. It's in there. A buddy video'ed an 8 many years ago. And I have release them up to 5.8. Thinking I might try a day of 5-9 inch swimbaits and see what happens!
