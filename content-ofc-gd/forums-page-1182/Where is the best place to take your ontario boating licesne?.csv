Couldn't find it on an Ontario govt site, so I wasnt sure...  who is the keeper of the answers on this one?  Thanks in advance!"

93171,drifter,2007-07-12 00:16:00,12,I just bought a boat and I just took the online exam a little while ago. www.BoaterExam.com.  I learnt a bit but not enough. I agree it's a money grabber. I passed the exam and the next weekend I went out I had to get towed in   . Hmm...Did I learn anything from the exam???? Lol. But I did manage to catch FISH.    Anyways...It only took 2 weeks and I got my card...( which I was pretty surprised). To the point...When they sent me my card they gave me  $10 off coupon. If you decide to do the test online then pm me and I will give you the discount code. Or if anyone else is interested just pm me and I will give you the code.
