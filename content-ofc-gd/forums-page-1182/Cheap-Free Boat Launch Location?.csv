92573,wmshaw,2007-07-10 19:03:00,42,"Try Sibbald point just 2km up the road.  $11.00 to park and lauch.  Also Harry's in Keswick, $7 to park and launch.  Virginia Beach is around $20.00 to park and launch.  The deal that Bonnie Boats cut with the town of Georgina is really bad for non-residents.  They get a piece of the parking revenues.   The $10.00 you paid is supposed to cover parking in their lot but when it is full, you get stuck with the non-resident parking fee of $30.00.  I will launch elsewhere and the Town of Georgina and Bonnie Boats will no longer get any of my cash.  Bill"
92583,young_one,2007-07-10 19:26:00,620,Sibbald Point. You mean the provincial park? Or is the launch seperates from the park? If it is in the park? Don't I have to pay the vehicle fee plus each person on board?

92692,Sinker,2007-07-11 00:18:00,8692,"Whatever you do, don't launch at Bonnie boats......  I launched there on saturday and it was indeed $40. I was under the assumption that it was only $10 to launch, as it always has been, as long as you park in their lot. I had a $30 parking ticket when I got back to the docks. I heard thru the grapevine that sibbalds is $16 to launch and park......I'll try there next time.  I'll never go there again......what a rip off!!! The town of Georgina can kiss my white hairy _____!!!! Sinker"
92700,ilario,2007-07-11 00:46:00,166,I only go to free launch sites... there are public ones around  they're few nd far in between...don't know of any at Simcoe..
92917,wmshaw,2007-07-11 15:13:00,42,"I actually launched in Sibbald Point Provincial Park.  I went there in May and they charged me a fee of $11.00 to park and launch my boat.  There were two of us in the car at the time.  The ramp is concrete and 3 boats can easily be lauched there at once.  Lots of parking right at the ramp.  You can call them to confirm the fees at  Sibbald Point Provincial Park 26465 York Road 18, R.R.#2 Sutton West, Ontario L0E 1R0 905-722-8061  I hope that this helps you out.  Bill  "
92922,wmshaw,2007-07-11 15:25:00,42,"At the end of Hadden Road, off of highway 48, there is a free launch on Lake Simcoe.  In my opinion it is not a great launch (dirt and gravel) but it is free if you are will to walk some distance to your car for parking.  The main problem is parking.  There are no parking signs all over.  You would have to walk a kilometer back from the launch to find a spot with free parking  Hope that helps!  Bill  "
92926,bassman,2007-07-11 15:38:00,384,Where is the launch in Beaverton?
