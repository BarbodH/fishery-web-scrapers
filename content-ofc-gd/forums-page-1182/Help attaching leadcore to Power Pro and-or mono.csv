93038,SlowPoke,2007-07-11 19:32:00,2984,Leadcore + Dipsy eh? 1. How on earth do you expect to determine your exact running depth? 2. What makes you think a dipsy would pull the rope-like leadcore down any further than braid? Either someone is playing a crual joke on you or you're confusing leadcore with wire. -Brian
93049,fisher,2007-07-11 19:58:00,451,"SlowPoke,  there is an entire discussion about just that - dispeys and lead core.  Posts are from the regualrs as well as the moderators...don't think they are joking..  http://spoonpullers.proboards42.com/index....5279&page=2"
93108,ilario,2007-07-11 21:36:00,166,"  slowpoke, never hurts to keep an open mind and try new techniques... anyhow, i wouldn't necessarily run dipsey's/core 100% of the time...mixing 'n matching...."
93269,SlowPoke,2007-07-12 08:01:00,2984,"Thanks for the link fisher.  Poacher, I have an open mind. Can you answer my questions?  If you're looking for stealth and you want to target depth with spoons, try running a Slide Diver on your backing ahead of 4 colours and 20 yrds fluoro. You can determine your depth to the SD from your line counter and add 20ft depth for four colours. This gets your bait out from the boat and the Slide Diver is way out of sight from the bait. When a fish hits, the SD releases and slides down the line.  -Brian"
92998,fisher,2007-07-11 18:19:00,451,Willis Knot....That is what I used to connect both the fluorocarbon leader - one knot and the power pro backing - 2 knots.  And it was tested this weekend with a 14 lb rainbow.
93003,fisher,2007-07-11 18:25:00,451,http://www.greatlakesfisherman.com/forums/...hread.php?t=451  Willis Knot step by step instructions.  Worked for me on the first try - mind you I was uising the 45lb lead core and threading 40lb power pro into it.
93013,ilario,2007-07-11 18:47:00,166,  that's a great idea... i did try to thread a needle through but it was too thick. I think I may be running 18lb test lead core and that might be the reason its not trheading...it's too thin.. i can't recall what size 'cause I've had this core now for 3 seasons...i used it to fish for lakers in haliburton in the past and i think i went with a thinner diameter at the time... the 27lb must be thicker  thanks
93014,ilario,2007-07-11 18:48:00,166,"  yes, that might be the problem...as i said in the other post, it may be that i'm using 18lb core   i did see that site - pretty good instructions and it looks so easy!"
93018,ilario,2007-07-11 18:55:00,166,"  That's an awesome site...so much clearer than the others i've seen.  thanks, i just saved it in favourites!  PP"
93030,Uncle Buck,2007-07-11 19:15:00,1000,"i spooled 2 reels with 27 lb core and 2 spools with 18lb core... you just need to find a smaller needle  Hey PP, i just noticed you signed up on OFC on my birthday!!  the fish gods will bless you"
