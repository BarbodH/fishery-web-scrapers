Our report is very similar to Joe K's and SetoMonkey's.  Nice to have met you Mike, and your friend.  The lodge was one of the nicest we have ever stayed at.  The cabin we stayed in was newly renovated, very clean and well equipped.  We did the meal plan for the first time and it was great.  Hearty portions and terrific food.  Having the option of having your meals delivered to your cabin was a nice touch and one we appreciated when we made the long haul into Hodge Lake.  Ed, Judy, Brian and Leslie were excellent hosts and really seemed to care that things were just right.  If only the weather was as friendly as our hosts!  As the other guys said, it was all over the map.  Sunny and warm for a couple of days and then a huge drop in temperature along with relentless winds.  We left early Sunday morning on July 1st and it was a balmy 7C lol.  The fishing was not the greatest for us but not unexpected with the weather conditions.  The back lake trips were terrific.  We fished Everett, Hodge and Dinny as well as the main lake.  Hodge was the definite highlight.  It took us about 2 hours each way with a couple of short portages.  Most of the way was through a shallow creek channel with just enough submerged rocks to keep Captain Crash(me) on edge.  Well worth it though.  I had my personal best pike break me off at the side of the boat and give me a face wash as he/she disappeared back into the depths.  Charlotte almost had two heart attacks as two monster pike followed her husky jerk within inches of the boat.  The biggest one even opened wide and displayed and impressive set of dental work before peeling off at the last moment.  I would love to fish all the lakes again with stable weather.  But for a couple of amateurs we did okay and the scenery was spectacular. Going to try posting some pictures for the first time.  Fingers crossed I don't mess it up.

92931,lew,2007-07-11 15:52:00,12767,Really good to hear your trip to Lost Lake went so well !!  It's been 10 years now since I was there but it sounds as if things just keep getting better every year. The folks that run that outfit sure know how to treat their guests.  Tough luck with the bad weather but it looks as if you guys made the most of it and still put a few decent fish in the boat.  Thanks for taking the time to give us a report on your trip.
