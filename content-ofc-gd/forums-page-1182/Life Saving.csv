STROKE: Remember The 1st Three Letters... S.T.R. If everyone can remember something this simple, we could save some folks. Seriously.. Please read: RECOGNIZING A STROKE Thank God for the sense to remember the ""3"" steps, STR .. Read and Learn! < BR>Sometimes symptoms of a stroke are difficult to identify. Unfortunately, the lack of awareness spells disaster. The stroke victim may suffer severe brain damage when people nearby fail to recognize the symptoms of a stroke   Now doctors say a bystander can recognize a stroke by asking three simple questions:   S *       Ask the individual to SMILE. T *       Ask the person to TALK to SPEAK A SIMPLE SENTENCE                    (Coherently) (i.e. It is sunny out today) R *       Ask him or her to RAISE BOTH ARMS.   NOTE: Another 'sign' of a stroke is this: Ask the person to 'stick' out their tongue. If the tongue is 'crooked', if it goes to one side or the other that is also an indication of a stroke.  If he or she has trouble with ANY ONE of these tasks, call 911 immediately !! and describe the symptoms to the dispatcher."

93145,motv8tr,2007-07-11 23:11:00,2587,Good tips to know....a good friend of mine had a stroke a few years ago...they rushed her to the hospital...she was treated and sent home....too soon it turned out...when released she was still in danger it seems.  Thankfully she has recovered about 90% and is now retired  Maureen
93155,danc,2007-07-11 23:29:00,4677,"Or better yet, take the St. John Ambulance level A CPR course. I took it last January and it involves recognizing and treating many common illnesses that can suddenly occur to anyone anywhere, including stroke. I learned a lot there and feel better for it."
93308,Woodsman,2007-07-12 13:22:00,1286," I can't agree more that training is the key. As a St. John Ambulance First Aid & CPR instructor and a Advanced Medical First Responder I would recommend a Standard First Aid/ CPR-C course. This aprox. 18 hr. course will cover most of your first aid needs including CPR for adults, children & infants.  Best Wishes: Rick"
