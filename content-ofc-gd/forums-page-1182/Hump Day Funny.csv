The 4 Year-old nods his head in approval. The 6 year-old continues, ""When we go downstairs for breakfast, I'm gonna say something with 'hell' and you say something with 'ass.' The 4 year-old agrees with enthusiasm.  When their mother walks into the kitchen and asks the 6 year-old what he wants for breakfast, he replies, ""Aw hell Mom, I guess I'll have some Cheerios."" WHACK! He flies out of his chair, tumbles across the kitchen floor, gets up, and runs upstairs crying his eyes out with his mother in hot pursuit, slapping his rear with every step. She locks him in his room and shouts, ""You can stay in there until I let you out."" She then comes back downstairs, looks at the 4 year-old and asks with a stern voice, ""And what do YOU want for breakfast, young man? ""I don't know,"" he blubbers, ""but you can bet your fat ass it won't be Cheerios!"""
