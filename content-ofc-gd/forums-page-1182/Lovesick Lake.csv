I used to fish Stoney a lot more but StoneyLakeResort closed down which was a very good place to rent boats from far above the rest. Any honeyspots, tips, etc? Experience is great to learn from."

Though that was almost 10 yrs. ago when I was there. If I remember right we also caught a few Largemouth and Smallmouth as well. Never tried for Walleye.  Just curious about your handle Bass Killer. Whats the scoop ??? Hope it's a good thing   Hookset."

I booked boat rental for Saturday, from what I heard Lovesick has the highest percentage of islands in the kawarthas, thats a key reason i like Stony so much, I hope I made the right decision to try this lake out, I've only hit Stony once so far this year but no other lake Ive been on I like so much... as for goin slow only 8hp on the rental so shouldnt have too much difficulty  but thx for the tip"
