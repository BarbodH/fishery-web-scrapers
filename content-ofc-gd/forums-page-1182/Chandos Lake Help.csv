Anyway, my first question is, anyone have any tips for walleye?  I don't really target them too often since I don't want to eat them, but I do like catching them and then dumping them back.  I guess it's just the challenge.  But this time it's just too challenging; I haven't even seen one yet.  I do fairly well for Walleye when I go to Lower Buckhorn, but nothing so far at Chandos.  My other question is, for smallmouth and pike where are the lunkers?  All my bass have been 1 lb and less and the pike have been like 3 lbs or less.  The lake is really deep, a lot deeper than Buckhorn so maybe that's why I haven't been doing too well.  Btw, I had an account on this board a few years ago, the fishing kind of died down when I graduated and got into the workforce.  Trying to start up again and not let work get in the way."

92201,Starcraft,2007-07-09 21:22:00,19,"  hmmm...  i swear the MNR site or one of my fishing books says that there are walleye at Chandos.  maybe i read wrong.  anyway, thanks for the tips.  heading up there next week"
