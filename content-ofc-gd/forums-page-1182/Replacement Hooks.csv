93184,FishFinder,2007-07-12 00:45:00,481,Just wondering if anyone can suggest any hooks to use for replacing on spoons such as the little cleo and large rapala J-13's. Not looking to use single hooks. Thanks!
93185,jeffw,2007-07-12 00:59:00,267,I replace and use only vmc hooks. I find them to be strong and well priced. Lebarons sell them at only a couple bucks a package and they come in coated or just bronze. Cheers Jeff

93244,silvio,2007-07-12 03:57:00,433,You laughed when I asked you the other day Aleks. But I was right hehehe. Told you it happens some times. If you don’t understand what I am saying all tell you on msn. Won’t it be hard to fish with a broken leg?
