It's that pretty spring fed lake with the turquoise water near Buckhorn.  I've never fished the lake, although we've driven past it a few times.  Does anyone know of what fish call the lake home, or have any experience fishing the lake.  Any general knowledge would be appreciated.  Thanks!"
93093,jediangler,2007-07-11 21:21:00,1923,An old-timer told me a giant musky story about Sandy lake that took place over 30yrs ago. The fish got away but made quite an impression on all those who witnessed it. They were walleye fishermen and could always feed themselves by trolling original rapalas in gold w/black back. Good luck.
