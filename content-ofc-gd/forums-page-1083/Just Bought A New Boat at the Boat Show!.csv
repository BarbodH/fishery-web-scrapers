153469,corvette1,2008-01-23 13:45:00,1765,what a ride you will love the boat
160621,aaav8or,2008-02-14 17:16:00,2,"Hey....do you know that Ranger will let you ""visit"" your boat while it's being built ?? I just learned my new 620 is being started at the factory on March 5th asnd will be done on March 13th. I can come any time in the last 3 days and take a private plant tour, and see my boat being fabricated !! Pretty cool I think."
160704,Rich Clemens,2008-02-14 22:08:00,3131,"Very, Very, Very (sigh)  nice."
151308,b2kptbo,2008-01-16 13:22:00,1505,"WOW, your gonna enjoy that baby..."
151318,Sinker,2008-01-16 13:56:00,8692, Ah.....a man that knows how to pick a boat
151321,Gerritt,2008-01-16 13:58:00,6129,That aint a boat it is a friggen rocket!  Nice ride man!   G
151325,JFR,2008-01-16 14:03:00,498,"Nice ride, congrats and enjoy"
151331,walleyemen,2008-01-16 14:17:00,316,"Nice Ride!!! Again be sure to follow that breakin to a tee, my opinion that makes or breaks a motor, again congrats."
151339,bigbuck,2008-01-16 15:09:00,2449,N I C E ! ! ! !  That's my dream boat!! Your family will enjoy that baby for many many years. She's the Cadillac of boats!  Use it in good health and may you catch many fish in her.
151354,bucktail,2008-01-16 16:43:00,1857,Awesome rig. I have heard the same thing that Irishfield has said. that you have to follow the breakin exactly on the Verados otherwise bad things happen. After that I heard they are super sweet! Congrats!
151381,Mark Kulik,2008-01-16 19:08:00,348,Nice Minnow! see you on the water!
151383,fishermccann,2008-01-16 19:11:00,655,I need to win any lottery!!!!!!!!!!!!!
151390,irishfield,2008-01-16 19:48:00,26272," Break in is REALLY easy... just follow it. First two hours are critical... next 8 so so. After 10 hours you're good to go. They don't even recommend an oil change until the year/100hr is out, but I HIGHLY recommend you dump the lower unit and engine oil after the first 20 hours + a new filter. Will cost you $200 (to have shop do it...$80 or so less if you do it yourself) but money well spent. I cut the filter open and go thru all the pleats looking for shinny stuff... but that just me. I'm used to working on stuff that falls out of the sky when things get quiet!  Break in is as follows:  First TWO hours, run engine at varied throttle settings up to 4500 RPM or at three quarters throttle and at FULL throttle for approximately ONE minute every ten minutes (IMHO these full load runs are what seat the rings).  For the next EIGHT hours of operation avoid continuous operation at full throttle for more than five minutes at a time. VERY easy to do... as you can't afford 32 Gallons Per Hour for toooooo long! LOL"
151400,Landlocked,2008-01-16 20:33:00,171,Sheesh..that would take me all season
151408,irishfield,2008-01-16 20:48:00,26272,I think it took me 3 days Andy !
151444,fishindevil,2008-01-16 21:59:00,6254,"WOW..Nice fishing machine !!!!!.  ...amazing,ride...so when are we all going fishing with you !!!....cheers"
151451,lovetofish,2008-01-16 22:07:00,500,Wow!!!  Must be nice... one day  lovetofish
151539,Smokey,2008-01-17 01:00:00,1278,"Very Nice, Congrats and Enjoy."
151570,LeXXington,2008-01-17 01:57:00,1928,"WOW, nice ride"
151602,David Chong,2008-01-17 04:08:00,836,"Congrats on the new ride! You'll love the Ranger! Greg & his staff at DT Power Sports are awesome! Cheers, Dave"
151609,young_one,2008-01-17 05:04:00,620,"Nice ride! That's some serious tournament fishing boat. I own a 997 SI aswell, don't know how good you are with electronics, but I'm pretty bad. Took me all season to figure out the basic functions, and I'm still learning. Due to my limited abilities, the unit didnt seem as effective as the ads shown. Here is a really good website that has a lot of useful information on the Sideimaging combos. Just like a computer, the $2k 997si has software updates and bugs. Be sure to sign-up for the Humminbird member on the company's site aswell. Side Imaging  May the new boat bring you many successful fishing trips, young_one"
151616,SlowPoke,2008-01-17 09:01:00,2984,"   LOL Sinker, I probably would have overlooked the gunwales if I had the $40G... just trying to make myself feel better! -Brian"
151817,Minnow,2008-01-17 23:04:00,177,Thanks everyone and thanks irishfield for the verado break in tips will be sure to follow those to a tee! See you guys on the water and maybe a few tournaments as well gotta win some money back to pay for all this
151953,RandyLinden,2008-01-18 17:24:00,40,"Excellent boat! You will love the way this boat works, this is arguably one of the best if not the best fishing boats available today. Congrats I bet you can't wait to get your hands on it!!"
153340,aaav8or,2008-01-23 01:00:00,2,Very Sweet....I just bought the same boat....but with a ProXS and slightly different colors (Eclipse package Special Edition) I ordered it 4 days ago so ours will probably be built side by side !!
153345,Raf,2008-01-23 01:13:00,3495,"congrats, that is a sweet machine..  but, where do the rod holders go?  i am sure you'll have a blast in that thing."
153350,irishfield,2008-01-23 01:26:00,26272, Depending on the strength of those hand rails... I'd be goin rail clamp Pursuits or Bert's and sure wouldn't be drilling into that glass.
153360,Guest gbfisher,2008-01-23 01:54:00,0,Drill................
151236,Minnow,2008-01-16 02:57:00,177,"Hey guys!  Thanks for all the advice from my two previous threads on tournaments boat and lund fiberglass! After some serious research and shopping around my dad and I decided to go with the Ranger 620 VS!  We ordered the boat from D.T Powersports at the boat show and Greg the owner was a really nice guy and helped us customize our ranger to meet all our needs. He even introduced us to Joe Noel who is a pro fisherman I saw him on the CFT super series, I also saw Dave Mercer with him. They showed us the great humminbird side imaging technology, which is amazing by the way! Thank you to everyone on this board as well after reading all the discussions it really helped me make the right decisions!  This is the exact rig we got!    Here are the specs  2008 Ranger 620 VS Dual Console (Custom Colours) 2008 250 HP Mercury Verado 2008 9.9 HP Pro Mercury Kicker MinnKota 101 Maxx Trolling Motor Humminbird 997 Side Imaging in the Console Humminbird 787 in the Bow (Navionics Gold Included) Custom Ranger Trailer  Plus countless other features that come standard  Also we got Ranger 40th Anniversary G Loomis Rod Rapala Ranger Tackle Pack Ranger Custom Boat Cover  Free for the 40th Anniversary  Will have to wait for 10-12 Weeks while our Ranger is Custom Built at the Ranger Factory in Arkansas, Can't wait to get it out on the water in April! We wanted a boat for hardcore fishing as well as family and the cottage. A boat that can handle rough water and looks nice as well, and of course the most important is quality and I think we found it all and more in the Ranger 620! Can't wait for Bass Season!"
151237,Sinker,2008-01-16 03:11:00,8692,Must B nice!!!!  Congrats!  Sinker
151238,ccmtcanada,2008-01-16 03:12:00,7971,Wow....that's a sweet ride!!! Congrats!!
151239,JustinHoffman,2008-01-16 03:13:00,482,"Gorgeous looking boat, Minnow! Can't go wrong with a Ranger..  Now, let's just hope the forecasted $1.50/litre doesn't come true this summer, or you might want to start putting the pennies aside now...  Enjoy the ride..  Justin"
151242,Grimace,2008-01-16 03:39:00,2020,What an absolutely beautiful machine.
151243,Hooked,2008-01-16 03:44:00,891,
151250,medmart,2008-01-16 03:57:00,587,Beautiful looking boat wgt that's the same place i got mine  rob
151254,HTHM,2008-01-16 04:13:00,4082,sigh
151255,irishfield,2008-01-16 04:14:00,26272," Not to worry with the Verado... overall it will burn less fuel than a 115 2 stroke......much less fuel.  As for $1.50/litre... marina dock price hit $1.52/litre the summer Katrina went thru....so nothing new.  You and your Dad have a ball in that thing Minnow and be sure to follow the first TWO hour break in instructions for the Verado to the tee! Will take awhile to get use to docking the thing...because it's so quiet you'll think the motor shut off, but don't worry about grinding the starter...they defaulted the start circuit so you can't start it twice !!!"
151256,Pigeontroller,2008-01-16 04:20:00,2793,That is a nice boat! Enjoy.
151257,steverowbotham,2008-01-16 04:20:00,1800,i am truly jealous
151258,Dondorfish,2008-01-16 04:21:00,1000,Nice Machine!!!!!       Don
151259,Bernie,2008-01-16 04:23:00,3190,Nice Package!  The Verado is a great engine. Very smoooooooooth.
151260,JustinHoffman,2008-01-16 04:25:00,482,"I'm just jealous, Irish... (plus I'm used to the gas consumption my 20 HP provides me...)  Never knew the gas reached that high at the marina's that year! I always fill the boat up at road-side gas stations, so I was left in the dark about that gouge...  She's definitley a beauty ride...if only I had the money..  Good Fishing,  Justin"
151262,charlesn,2008-01-16 04:27:00,551,You got the cream of the crop there.  Great choice.  Good luck this season and we'll see you out there!  Charles
151263,kennyman,2008-01-16 04:38:00,737,NICE.... 25oHP Verado eh?? Hang on baby. That should be awesome. I have an 8HP Yamaha LOL. Your kicker is bigger.
151264,2 tone z71,2008-01-16 04:41:00,1311,very nice congrats love it
151268,fatherof3,2008-01-16 05:12:00,1769,"congrats,it looks great"
151273,Gerry,2008-01-16 07:49:00,257,"Congratulations on the new boat, you'll love it. It's almost identical to mine."
151274,SlowPoke,2008-01-16 09:09:00,2984,"Very nice boat! I looked very seriously at that model but opted for a 1987 Starcraft instead for two key reasons;  1: Starcraft had wider gunwales 2: Starcraft was $40,000 cheaper  You will certainly be riding in style this summer and many to come. Congrats! -Brian"
151278,mattyk,2008-01-16 10:29:00,2110,very sweet ride!
151279,darsky,2008-01-16 10:31:00,586,you would be even happier with the full windshield option-not too late
151280,Terry,2008-01-16 10:41:00,14456,sweet
