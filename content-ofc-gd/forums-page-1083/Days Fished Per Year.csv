160152,Reef Runner,2008-02-13 15:25:00,981,"I would guess about 150 days or so, if you can count chuckin' spoons off the lakeshore in Mississauga with not a hope in hell but just getting my line wet.  Minus those excursions, I would estimate about 75 days of QUALITY time on the water.  Man, I can't wait to retire and I'm only 26! lol  I envy most of you.  reefrunner"
160160,bassjnkie,2008-02-13 15:49:00,1101," Ya, I have a flexable career. Sponsered by a few shops helps. Most of the time I am fishing, I am really woking. To add to that, no wife or kids (wouldn't have time for that), just married to fishing and the job. No don't have a place on the water but have a few places in Hamilton to fish and test carp gear.  If Im ever lucky to get married and have kids   , than the 203 days will be 50 or so.LOL  Daniel OCH"
160276,SlowPoke,2008-02-13 20:54:00,2984,I would estimate 30-40 times in 2007 and that was my best year. For 2008 I hope to top that with some more shore fishing/river walking. -Brian
160308,Rich,2008-02-13 22:28:00,3927,Last time I did a fish log (kept track of every fishing trip in a journal) I did like 268. That was a couple of years ago.. don't fish so much now.. maybe only 200
160635,fishermccann,2008-02-14 18:00:00,655,about 40
159170,fisherguy,2008-02-10 18:18:00,21,"Very close to 210 days / 07. Mmmmm, yes full time retirement is as wonderful as they say."
159691,gekhunter,2008-02-12 01:33:00,61," I hear ya, 20 to 30 days at best for me..."
160081,Hawg Hunter,2008-02-13 11:54:00,204,"seeing as your counting a few hours after work(3or4)and 2-3 hrs in the morn before work im fishing about 200 + days a year.our ice fishing season on the BOQ started dec 4th for us and sense then ive missed 9 days  ,due to white outs and a warm spell we had great post i enjoyed reading all your posts.  Hawg Hunter"
158734,Fishnwire,2008-02-09 00:34:00,983,"About how many days a year do you guys fish?  I have a little calendar in my lunchbox where I write down the overtime I work.  This year I started to also mark down each day I that I fish.  I'm at 14 as of today, it'll be 16 by Sunday.  I think it's possible I will exceed 100.  I remember reading in In-Fisherman that Al Lindner fished about 230 days a year, if any of you folks are anywhere near big Al, I take my hat off to you."
158737,Riparian,2008-02-09 00:39:00,269,I probably fish 50 to 100 times a year. It would be far greater if I owned a boat.
158738,bassjnkie,2008-02-09 00:42:00,1101,I did the same thing with my PDA and last year with no ice fishing. I fished 203 days open water. If I did ice fish it would be more. Haven't check yet for 2008.  Fish Hard!! Daniel OCH
158740,kuhaman,2008-02-09 00:57:00,503,"bonghitts,now thats a great handle!!!!"
158743,Riparian,2008-02-09 01:09:00,269,Its too bad you decided to slam him rather than answer a perfectly fine question about fishing.
158744,Fishnwire,2008-02-09 01:10:00,983,"OntCarp is the King!  Are you retired?  Do you own a house on the water?  How do you do it, man?  My wife lets me fish as much as I want...we have no kids yet, but having to show up at work 5 days a week really gets in the way of wetting a line.  As far as my handle goes...when I chose it I didn't realize this was a ""family"" oriented site.  Am I going to get in trouble?  I tried, but I can't figure out how to change it."
158746,Riparian,2008-02-09 01:18:00,269,Mods can change it for you  live and learn.
158747,GbayGiant,2008-02-09 01:19:00,1780,"I hardly ice fish, but basically every other day from Walleye opener to ice up, so from May 1st to Dec ? . Wow that would only be a little over 100 so to get 200 in open water season it would have to be every day almost from opener to ice on average in Ontario."
158748,irishfield,2008-02-09 01:23:00,26272,"I don't keep track.. maybe I should start. Last year.. somewhere around a 120 days.  As for your handle.. go to ""my controls"" and if you want you can change it there... not that there's any real need. There's worse around here..."
158749,Roy,2008-02-09 01:25:00,13728,"What do you want to be called, I'll change it for you."
158751,crappieperchhunter,2008-02-09 01:26:00,2582,I figure I average a little better then a day a week...so maybe 70 days a year. When I am retired I count on that doubling!!!
158752,Fishnwire,2008-02-09 01:31:00,983,"I'm happy with Bonghitts to be honest, but I don't want to be a bad role model to ""the kids"" or anything.  Do you think a name change is prudent, Roy?"
158753,Roy,2008-02-09 01:33:00,13728,"Do what you like Bud, was just trying to help."
158754,Riparian,2008-02-09 01:34:00,269, 
158756,iceguy,2008-02-09 01:38:00,341,Im going to guess around a hundred days(lots during salmon season) I'm going to try and keep track from now on. I'd lose count on the bong hits.
158761,Fishnwire,2008-02-09 01:41:00,983,"Thank you Roy.  I appreciate your help.  I'm new here and not sure what kind of sense of humor the community has.  Considering we're all fishermen, I guess I don't have to worry about anyone being too uptight.  Those of us that have tapped the source can't be bothered to fuss over the little things, am I right?"
158769,OhioFisherman,2008-02-09 02:05:00,6623,"When I was in between wives like 4 or 5 days a week late March thru November, a lot of it was after work in the dark! Learned to like night fishing! Now a lot less, like once, still fished a lot until illness hit."
158772,Terry,2008-02-09 02:10:00,14456,"doesn't anyone work  I don't keep track, as many days as I can I get out"
158784,Vanselena,2008-02-09 02:45:00,269,"In the summer I fish every day the winds allow, less after October until ice season. In the spring I am fishing every second day when the walleye are in the river. That being said it is likely an average on 52 days a year."
158793,huntervasili,2008-02-09 04:10:00,1604,Hmm I would say anywhere around 70 times for me...
158794,steverowbotham,2008-02-09 04:21:00,1800,"Over the past 3 years my range has been 72-117, 72 was in 05, and I was dissapointed lol, 117 was in 06 in it was the best"
158796,carll2,2008-02-09 04:34:00,443,"while im working up north guiding probably 130 days x 7-10hrs a day from may till october ,,then maybe 10 days ice fishing ..so about 140 days a year,,,the rest of my days are spent snowmobiling"
158801,Mike the Pike,2008-02-09 05:03:00,3421, I am jealous Carl.Wow little ...............
158802,Mike the Pike,2008-02-09 05:07:00,3421, But Wayne that just doesn't add up to the fishin reports and fish pics  I hope to see more reports this year and its OK if the family out fishes you
158804,irishfield,2008-02-09 05:09:00,26272,Been told today Mike ?
