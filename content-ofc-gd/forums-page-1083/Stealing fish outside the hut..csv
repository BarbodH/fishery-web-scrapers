How stupid is that?   dsn

161043,bushart,2008-02-16 14:07:00,2628,Cool--kinda the minks version of revenge on mankind.  One time a few years back myself and another guy were ice fishing a lake in Northern Ontario in the early spring. We had a couple eaters caught and laying beside the holes in the snow---we were standing by one hole and then suddenly a bald eagle flew ought of a tree and grabbed a fish from the hole furthest from us---pretty comical.
