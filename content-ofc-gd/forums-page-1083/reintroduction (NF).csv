158940,trapshooter,2008-02-09 22:37:00,1234,"Hi all.  I decided it was time to change my username.  I haven't been involved in competative trapshooting for years now so it's time for a change.  I have been a member of the OFCÂ© for a long time now... 4 or 5 years.  My new username, BenBeattie, is my real name.  I am originally from SW Ont, near London.  For 3 years I have been a fishing guide in NW Ont, on Lac Seul.  After this coming season my wife and I are moving to Sioux Lookout where I will continue to guide.  I am also getting into the writing aspect of things and hope you can all find my name in print soon  Here are some pics from last season.        Cheers,  ben"
158948,Smokey,2008-02-09 23:09:00,1278,Hey Ben. What lodge are you going to be working for this year or are you going to out on your own?  Mike
158949,irishfield,2008-02-09 23:12:00,26272,Welcome aboard Ben ! Anyone tell you we like pictures !
158955,lew,2008-02-09 23:38:00,12767,"Welcome to OFC BenBeattie, not that you ever left or anything, but figured we'd better make it official  Best of luck with your writing Ben, you gonna be writing about your guiding experiences ??"
158957,Joey,2008-02-09 23:44:00,9122,Best of luck to you with your writing and guiding Ben.  Those are some pretty impressive fish there.  I think the cooler has seen better days tho  Joey
158962,trapshooter,2008-02-09 23:59:00,1234,"Thanks guys.  Mike, I'm back at Silver Water Wheel this year.  After we move to Sioux Lookout I'm planning on going out on my own after a while.  Lew - Right now I'm focusing my writing on walleye fishing and things I've learned while guiding.  I've had some great advice from JP Bushey, Justin Hoffman and Gord Ellis.  Outdoor writing can be a tough nut to crack but I'm determined to get myself published."
158964,solopaddler,2008-02-10 00:06:00,8605,"Funny, I've been thinking about a name change as well, LOL!  Keep a day free when you're down this way in April Ben..  Cheers"
158965,Whopper,2008-02-10 00:08:00,2174,Good deal Ben!  Your living what most of us dream about.  Good Luck!
158966,lew,2008-02-10 00:19:00,12767,"JP's a good guy to learn from Ben, he's written some excellent articles, specially in EA"
158967,Clampet,2008-02-10 00:20:00,1947,"Eee doggies, welcome back!! Hafta agree with Joey about thet cooler. Tell us the story behind that cooler.  There's gotta be a tale to be told.  "
158976,trapshooter,2008-02-10 00:48:00,1234,"Actually, that cooler belongs to JP.  Having said that, I'm sure most of you can imagine where that thing has been and what it has seen & held.  Maybe he should upgrade to a Joey-sized model!?!?   Solo - you know it buddy!"
158983,Bernie,2008-02-10 01:05:00,3190,"Good stuff Ben. I believe you have the all the skill, determination and personality to do what you plan."

160450,tinbanger,2008-02-14 03:39:00,1028,"welcome BB or welcome back .  Never did get up to Lac Seul to try out your tips but there always this year.  My oldest son is headed to either Fleming or Sault college for the Fish game technology couses .Been hinting to him that maybe he should look at spending summer working a lodge up north . Do you recomend that ? He's worried about making enough money to cover his schooling. Right now he's planning to keep working at the local grocery store He is an excellent fisherman , gets along well with most folks and I think would make an excellent guide ... but hey he's my son !  and Keep those pictures coming  TB"
160771,trapshooter,2008-02-15 02:58:00,1234,"TB - I would definitely recommend that your son guides while going to school.  The lodge I work for doesn't charge any camp costs (i.e. free food and room) so you can save a lot of your money.  Plus it's an hour in the bush so it's hard to spend your money, except on beer and tackle!  Overall it's a great experience for a young man and has paid a lot of ppl's way through school.   Our lodge advertises at fleming for guides and a lot have been hired from the fish/game course.  If he's interested you can always PM me and I'd be happy to talk to him about my experiences.  Getting in at a good lodge makes all the diference for personal enjoyment and $$$."

160839,tinbanger,2008-02-15 14:51:00,1028,thanks Ben  I'll put him in touch with you .   tb
