Since Uncle Teddy owns about a dozen different magazines he throws the subscription onto your monthly Rogers bill.......   Here's the link  https://your.rogers.com/store/cable/cableco...DGB8P1KWKE35921"
160574,LeXXington,2008-02-14 15:49:00,1928,Or you can join http://www.ofah.org/ and get it plus other things included in the cost!!
160625,ketchenany,2008-02-14 17:31:00,3229,Uncle Ted just recently upped his rates for services so I'm sure it's all covered and he may be even making a profit on that $.
160629,fish_finder,2008-02-14 17:44:00,370,"No doubt he's profiting, why else would they offer something like that??"
160637,Lefty,2008-02-14 18:08:00,14,"Just wait. One month after you sign up Uncle Ted will send you a letter stating that cost have gone up blah blah blah, we are now charging you $1.50. I'm not kidding.  L."
160645,bbog,2008-02-14 18:24:00,665,I'd sign up for that deal if I wasn't already receiving my OOoD from OFAH.
160682,Oktravis,2008-02-14 20:49:00,62,"thanks for the heads up.I took them up on there offer. btw, on the first screen it says $1.00 then on the next screen it says $1.50 still better than cover price"
160750,JerseyDog,2008-02-15 01:14:00,190,"Join OFAH.  $50 - you get the mag, you get the insurance, and you get a real bitchy group that stays in the face of the province and feds fighting for what should be our rights.  I happily pay the fee."
160767,trapshooter,2008-02-15 02:25:00,1234,"Couldn't agree more, OFAH is a great organization."
