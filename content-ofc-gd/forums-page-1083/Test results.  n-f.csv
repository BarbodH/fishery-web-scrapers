160786,Nanook,2008-02-15 04:23:00,565,"Just got my test results in. The Colon is free and clear. The cancer got out of the Prostate and the Catscan shows lesions on my tail bone. It can be slowed down and/or stopped with Hormone shots  over a period of time. So all in all, its good news for me.  I want to thank everyone who sent good thoughts and wishes,and the PM's and e - mails to me. Believe me, they made a big difference to my attitude, and helped me in a BIG way to get thro' the last 6-7 weeks. THANKS AGAIN !!  Nanook  My only worry now is, if the hormones make me grow 'Boobs' will I be safe at Lakair!"
