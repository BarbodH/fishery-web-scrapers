160584,Fishmaster,2008-02-14 16:04:00,920,This is one of those personal bests that we all want to have!     The bite was hot this morning for JHM…This one is going on his wall.  Pretty sure these pictures are going to speak for themselves.     The ice at present is 5”-6” in most areas!  These beauties were caught in 13.5 feet of water where JHM was marking lots of fish when he called it a day!  Way to go! WOW
160594,jhm,2008-02-14 16:22:00,15,That was a crazy morning ...........My brother In-law stiffed me........... I wanted to go down river and try it there but my Yukon is to heavy to pull by myself so I set up right in front of Fishmasters shop..............And boy did that pay off.............I caught 3 walleyes lost another 3lber at the hole and another fish half way up............This must be a fresh run all dark beautiful yellow walleyes..............I marked all kinds of fish out there today.............Only left to be with my Valentine.............Steve set me up with a taxidermist I'm going to table mount this BEAST..............Steve said yesterday that the bite should pick up because of the solar moon cycle thing  (I thought it was a bunch of crap) but I'm believing now...............I actually only kept this fish because my trailer hook got caught in the gills that happened on 2 fish today............So if you plan on releasing your fish you might not want to use stinger hooks............JHM ;D............I usually don't smile in my picture's but I can't stop smiling now...............LOL
