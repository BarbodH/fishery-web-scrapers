160269,bucktail,2008-02-13 20:40:00,1857,"The day  after the leafs missed the playoffs  (again), they were at the ACC cleaning out their lockers.  Bryan McCabe invited the boys over on Canada day for a party, all  the players agreed to come. ""Can you all bring beer?"" he asked the  team...  Tucker suggested that  McCabe call Paul Maurice, invite him, and tell him to pick up the  beer.  Maurice agreed to this  and said that he would pick it up and bring it  over.  Canada day came, and  Maurice loaded up his car with case after case of beer for the team  and headed over to McCabe's place for some fun. On the road, he  got stopped at a light and heard the car next to him honking like  crazy, and some man yelling ""GO LEAFS GO, GO LEAFS GO!""  Maurice unrolled  his window, and looked at the man, Leafs flags still hanging all  over his car... Hey Coach the man yelled ""What's with all the  beer???""  Maurice replied ""I picked it up for McCabe!!  The man looked at  the beer in the back for a moment before yelling... ""Good Trade, Good  Trade!!!"""

The driver says, ""I got it for my wife"" hitchhiker replies, ""oooh, good trade""  even funnier involving McCabe though.  They'd be lucky to get a box of ""day olds"""
