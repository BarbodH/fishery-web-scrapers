160538,Headhunter,2008-02-14 14:19:00,5703,"Ok, here goes; (for four people) -use the largest bowl you have -salt (kosher) about a 1/4 teaspoon -4 cloves of fresh garlic, using a fork, crush the garlic into the salt -separate the yolks of three fresh eggs and add yolks to garlic -1/4 cup of good olive oil -1 teaspoon of vinegar -juice of half a fresh lemon -fresh ground pepper -1/4 teaspoon of dry mustard mix these ingredients thoroughly, they will form a loose paste  Now, add your cut Romain lettuce, add grated parmesan (sp) cheese, bacon bits and croutons and mix it thoroughly Should serve 4 people!

160540,Bernie,2008-02-14 14:21:00,3190," Joe, don't bring any of that with you tomorrow. Heartburn all weekend."
160542,pigeonfisher,2008-02-14 14:35:00,696,  Doesn't the lettuce look funny in a glass with ice?  How would you drink this?  I just don't understand.  Where would you put the chicken wings?
160546,Headhunter,2008-02-14 14:47:00,5703,"You can rim the bowl with chicken wings! Shrimp aren't bad with it either! Bernie, not to worry... it's a recipe I use to entertain the women... not nearly enough meat in it for my liking! I have pills for heart burn!LOL HH"
160562,John,2008-02-14 15:24:00,2956," You forgot the anchovies (just to make this a fishing post) and never, ever cut the lettuce, tear it........."
160651,Headhunter,2008-02-14 18:53:00,5703,"Yes John, I did forget the anchovies! I love'm, the wife hates them... so I usually forget 'em! I also tear the lettuce, but I figured cutting them would make them easier to fit into the glass! LOL! HH"
160829,blaque,2008-02-15 13:59:00,2419," The southern most point of Ontario......you know?.....Buffalo LOL  Its amazing how that imaginary line in the middle of the River ,15 minutes from my house, has the power to create such a difference in our terminology."

160854,blaque,2008-02-15 16:32:00,2419,"sounded close to a bloody mary. Either way......sounds like a delicious beverage when im having that salt craving.....which is pretty much all the time. It'd be a ""sipper"" for me  though, dont think Id want more than one of those in my gut."
160858,Vanselena,2008-02-15 17:20:00,269,"Ceasar  Large wooden bowl  Using a fork crush 2 garlic cloves and 2 strips of anchovies into the bowl until the garlic and anchovies become part of the bowl Add 2 egg yolks and mix with a fork Add 1/3 cup of first press olive oil Add salt to taste Add L&P about 3 shakes Add freshly ground pepper Mix into the bowl area where the garlic and anchovies are until smooth Add dried mustard until it thickens Squeeze lemon juice in until the consistancy and colour changes, make sure to taste. If it is too watery with the lemon added then add a bit more dry mustard. Add ripped romaine lettuce, bits of cooked bacon, croutons (made fresh in a pan (dried bread, butter, garlic, parsley)and freshly grated parm cheese.  should make enough for 4 people, or in my case enough for myself since I like to also top it with some chopped bbq'd chicken."
160872,Squid,2008-02-15 18:52:00,1656,"This thread is hilarious, Jerk sauce, proctologists pickles -Tuna juice.. And then to say that its not bad ???? Uhhhhh I got to go to the loo. Glen, you need to stick to the shine and leave the caesars to us canucks  I like to add a 1/2 teaspoon of seafood sauce to mine. Gives it a little extra kick."
160895,douG,2008-02-15 21:29:00,2693,"Once you've tried a properly seasoned Bloody Caesar, you will never have another Bloody Mary.  I find each spicy salty sweet sip tastes like another one.  Enjoy responsibly, btw."

160394,Crazyhook,2008-02-14 01:31:00,1154,Add jerk sauce instead of the regular stuff!
160400,Mattitude,2008-02-14 02:00:00,155,A little horseradish and dill pickle juice make them absolutley awesome!
160402,douG,2008-02-14 02:04:00,2693,"Oh dear, Glen.  That sounds just awful.  You need a lot more practice swillin' with the Northern contingent.  And a domestic supply of Motts' Spicy Clamato.  I like some lime juice in mine, salt and pepper on the top as well as the celery salt on the rim.  I also like a hot sauce with a little garlic in it, rather than the tabasco sauce, although the tb sauce will do.  Lee and Perrins Worcestershire is the only choice for that component.  Like any beautiful dish, it's all about the balance between hot and sweet, salt and sour.  It just takes practice.  I like Jerk (Walker's Wood outa Kingston JA) so maybe that might be a good substitute for the hot sauce.  There are many types of pickles, from bread and butter to dill to full-sour dill to sweet mix to hot mix to calabrese giardiniera.  Whatchoo talkin bout?  I wonder if pickled herring juice might work."
160406,crappieperchhunter,2008-02-14 02:12:00,2582,In my circle a Ceasar is not complete without the dill pickle. Slice it in half lengthwise but not all the way through...a cloths peg effect. Clip it over the edge of the glass. Goes perfect with a Ceasar. Dip...suck...chew...oh it's heaven.Forget about the celery...the pickle's the thing. Betcha  can't have just one.
160411,douG,2008-02-14 02:18:00,2693,Tell me about your pickles - Strubb's Full Sours?  Or just Bick's or Klassen's?  Inquiring Caesar fans need to know.

160423,crappieperchhunter,2008-02-14 02:38:00,2582,My pickle of choice...nothing fancy here... loblaws no name are actually my favourite with a Ceasar. They HAVE to be the garlic dills though. Nothing else will do.
