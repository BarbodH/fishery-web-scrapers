160892,snag,2008-02-15 21:10:00,1932,They are already noticeably up.  What do you think the outlook for the year will be?  
160898,gekhunter,2008-02-15 21:35:00,61,"Thought they were up primarily due to unusual thaw in Jan rather than extra precip?  That said, we are what  4x avg snowfall in feb.  Not sure what vegas is predicting but my bet us that levels recover from last year but not quite back to normal."
160923,GbayGiant,2008-02-15 23:43:00,1780,"It was the lowest I've ever seen it out fishing in late November, I hope all the snow helps a bit and hopefully we have a huge rainy spring."
160943,ccmtcanada,2008-02-16 00:51:00,7971,"The only good thing about all this snow is that water levels are coming back.  My local tribs are about half way back to normal and one of my fav shore spots has recovered about a foot.  Mind you, it's still down 2 feet from last year."

160965,bowshep,2008-02-16 02:18:00,378,Well Texas can send us more storms... Any time we can get water from somewhere else to fill our lakes and rivers its all good.  Peace Ken
161099,Canuck2fan,2008-02-16 21:30:00,1444,"Until the fix the ""hole"" in the Detroit River going into St.Clair and then Lake Erie Lake Huron and its rivers will never have decent water levels like in the old days.  http://www.usatoday.com/community/tags/top...e%20St.%20Clair  I wish the politicans in this countries would get some courage and spend the money to fix it....."
161135,Cookslav,2008-02-17 00:14:00,1457,"Any improvment would be nice...anything. We'll see, but I'm skeptical of any lasting raise.  The Detroit hole is an interesting piece of the puzzle....I guess if thats the culprit Then I suppose these low levels are permenant. Assuming they stop the dredging, and don't dredge further."
161140,Guest gbfisher,2008-02-17 00:28:00,0,A few more lost their docking at the end of last year with how low the water is now. Not as low as it was back in the 60's but close.  Don't think any amount of rain or snow fall is going to help. Who really knows if it will go back up. It has it's cycles. High levels a good 20 years ago put the water well over most permanent docks. It's just been down for a longer than normal period. On Georgian Bay that is...
