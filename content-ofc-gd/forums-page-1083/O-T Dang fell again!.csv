But this time I made it all the way to the front of the van before I fell! Once I figured out where all the blood was coming from and it was nothing serious I decided to try and get up. When the going gets tough? I did it! Dang felt like ice fishing?  Change of plans now, staying inside! Gotta thaw out I think."
160339,lew,2008-02-13 23:22:00,12767,Good to hear the injury wasn't too serious Paul
160340,Smokey,2008-02-13 23:23:00,1278,Sorry to hear about your fall Paul. You best hibernate inside till the ice and snow goes away. Rest up and get better.  Mike
160343,oldphart,2008-02-13 23:34:00,665,"~~~Have met up with my 2 buddies Jack, and Danails, they'll help you get better"
160354,Greencoachdog,2008-02-14 00:01:00,8163,"Glad to hear you weren't hurt bad Paul, at least with snow and ice you have a good excuse! I took a fall at the boat dock last Tues. that I'm still feeling. Feet flew out from under me on a wet wooden ramp and I landed full force on my tailbone/small of my back. Thought I'd ruined myself for sure. Doin ' better now though."
160481,OhioFisherman,2008-02-14 08:29:00,6623,"LOL I walk like jack and daniel are my bestests friends, just tough getting the brain to accept I am losing my mobility. It still thinks I can do stuff normally, creates a clash or crash when the legs don`t listen.  Belly flopped so I had a pretty good cushion, caught heck from the wife, she know`s I can be a little stubborn on trying to do things. Tough after an active life to be trapped indoors by a little snow. Another snow angel in the drive!  Thanks for the thoughts!  MS Sucks!"
160527,Whopper,2008-02-14 13:21:00,2174,"Damit man I hate when that happens and I don't even have a good excuse Paul!  Ohio in the upright and sitting position      That was a fun day and hopefully we can do it again this season, so no more falls Paul!"
160553,mistyriver1,2008-02-14 15:10:00,600,"Take it easy Paul, spring will be here before you know it.  Jim"
160572,OhioFisherman,2008-02-14 15:46:00,6623,"Great Phil scare the OFNer`s! any one want to rent me for Halloween?  Don`t wear red while fishing! It`s a warning to the fish! Stop! don`t bite! except sheepheads!  First and last time I wear that in a boat!  LOL Jim, I am starting to understand what the dogs are telling me, worse I am talking back!"
160579,lew,2008-02-14 15:57:00,12767," Fish don't mind red Paul, you just hafta know how to smile at them     "
160587,OhioFisherman,2008-02-14 16:08:00,6623,"LOL don`t recognize that species in the first picture Lew, you should quit picking on them poor bass though! I think I saw a picture of you with a trace of a grin! Probably photoshopped?"
160591,lew,2008-02-14 16:15:00,12767,"I always try to avoid those bass Paul, but they keep jumping in the way"
160593,OhioFisherman,2008-02-14 16:18:00,6623,"LOL Lew, ya like that would be frustrating?"
