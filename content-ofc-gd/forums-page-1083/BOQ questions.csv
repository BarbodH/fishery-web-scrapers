We are highly mobile and don't mind drilling holes by the dozen !  Any PMs appreciated , not looking for specific locations just a starting point .  thanks TB"

If you're not familiar with the area I'd recommend a guide for sure.  I was out there this past saturday with my 5 year old nephew and we used a guide.  The guide is actually on this board and goes by the name of hawg hunter.  Hes a great guide and I'd use him again the next time I go. Also the use of a guide will up your chances of hooking into some nice walleye.  Just a reminder the season closes on BOQ on feb. 28th.  Good luck."

C - 2; not more than 1 greater than 63 cm (24.8 in.)  We get an extra day to fish this year - Yipee"
160558,duber,2008-02-14 15:20:00,220,Contact either one of the bait shops in Belleville (Sam at Carra Outdoors or Ron at Skevys)and they can set you up with just the current ice conditions or a guide if you wish.A guide is certainly a good choice if you are only fishing one day and want to get on fish without searching all over for them.  Good luck
