160661,Vanselena,2008-02-14 19:29:00,269,Which is more important to you?
160662,capt bruce,2008-02-14 19:34:00,820,"Great designs blend both , but I will take ugly if it works , dont care how good it looks if it dont work , it has to go"
160663,Greencoachdog,2008-02-14 19:38:00,8163,I'll take function over form any day!
160665,John,2008-02-14 19:41:00,2956,damn ugly works for me........
160666,cranks bait,2008-02-14 19:46:00,721,"Practical for the most part.  Best example is my winter boots, Kamik rubber boot special.  I wear them everywhere.  If something turns out to be practical and fashionable it's a bonus.  Like our truck (Honda Ridgeline), can't wait to get it out of the shop"
160670,huntervasili,2008-02-14 20:17:00,1604,It has to be practical and of high quality. If ya have this I don't care how fashionable it is
160701,bbog,2008-02-14 21:57:00,665,"All things equal - Fashion wins, other than that practicality first!"
160709,gekhunter,2008-02-14 22:32:00,61,have to go practical.  the boat looks best when its full of fish so I choose whatever will get me that no matter how ugly.
160711,tapout,2008-02-14 22:40:00,166,must have a small boat to fill er up without going over the limit
160726,Rich Clemens,2008-02-14 23:38:00,3131,Practical ... that's why I had to buy a bigger one.
160742,Fisherman,2008-02-15 00:35:00,7201,"Practical, fashion is just eye candy that has no taste."
160753,Garry2Rs,2008-02-15 01:26:00,1425,"An ugly girl who owns a liqueur store and can cook might be practical, but I'm betting that's not who you married. Before I believe you guys always choose practical over fashion/beauty etc. I'd like to hear about some examples..."
160755,ccmtcanada,2008-02-15 01:41:00,7971," Well...here's my boat...not the prettiest....LOL.      Notice the lovely 20 year old seats, the 70's brown carpeting...LOL.  She floats, the motor works....that's all I need!"
160756,danc,2008-02-15 01:42:00,4677,"The Steelhead/centerpin guys seem to enjoy getting a shot of their reel in a bunch of photos. In fact it sometimes seems like the $500.00 reel is the focus of the photo. This always strikes me as a ""look at my awesome reel"" shot. My $75.00 Cabelas spinning reel catches a bunch of Steelhead too, but you'll never see it in a photo. And I've never thought that a more expensive reel would land more fish for me. So yes. I'm a believer in the fashion statement theory. It's a young person thing I think. When you get older, you also get wiser. And more thrifty."
160761,ccmtcanada,2008-02-15 01:52:00,7971, Here's my $39 reel....and $100 rod for steelhead....but this pic was for the fish...using the rod/reel as perspective only. 
160763,danc,2008-02-15 02:02:00,4677,Perfect example Cliff. How the heck did you ever manage to catch that fish without a $500.00 reel?  This one was also caught with a $39.00 Shimano reel from Walmart. By a novice fisherman using 6 lb. test to boot.  
160765,Sinker,2008-02-15 02:11:00,8692,I voted wrong.....sorry messed up. I'm all for practical. The simpler the better. No fancy gizmo's for this guy.  I'm also a cheap so and so.......  Sinker
160781,gekhunter,2008-02-15 03:34:00,61," ahhh, who am I foolin  even with my ugly practical gear I still get no fish  lol"
160796,SlowPoke,2008-02-15 09:05:00,2984,"Practical first, fashionable second. Example: Ugly Salty rod holders mounted on sexy Bert's tracks mounted on my ugly Starcraft!"
160813,OhioFisherman,2008-02-15 12:06:00,6623,LOL if I`m in the boat? Ugly has the edge!
160999,Mike the Pike,2008-02-16 04:24:00,3421,When the fishin gets tough I will do what I have to do Legally that is.  Forget the bling bling.Getting Skunked will sometimes happen but not without a battle
161005,GbayGiant,2008-02-16 04:38:00,1780,"There are so many options and different companies competing today,  you can usually find both in one product no matter what you need.  A lot of times something less expensive can look and function better."
161012,TJQ,2008-02-16 05:30:00,7806,You gotta be kidding me..   have you seen my boat>??
161060,Cookslav,2008-02-16 15:01:00,1457,"No doubt its practical for moi...  My Light & Medium action gear is always middle of the road, self tested stuff...meaning Brands like Shimano. Good brands that I trust, and Poles I personally like the feel of at the store. My Spinning reels I own are 2000 series Shimano, and a middle of the road Browing Fly rod and reel. I own a cheaper used center pin reel, and rod(handed down to me) And my heavy gear is a combo of BPS rods and a soon to be Pete mania reel....nothing Cheap, but definatly not high end and pretty  Then there's the boats... I own 3  A heavy but stable and durable Canoe That I pretty much use exusivly flor Algonquin Park.   My indestructable Punt/Drift boat I drift Shallow rocky rivers, and small hard to access lakes   Motor boat...new ""to me"" for bigger lakes(just slapped some manual riggers on it last fall)     They are not much to look at but they all float, and catch fish on occasion, so.... I rest my case"
161068,Garyv,2008-02-16 16:34:00,547,Two things I am not is politically correct and fashion conscious.  If somehing works catching fish I will buy it no matter what it looks like.  Heck I'm in the boat so it will never look stylish anyway.
