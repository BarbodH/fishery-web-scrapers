160408,Joeytier,2008-02-14 02:14:00,3990,"I'm looking to do some laker fishing this spring. Aside from trolling spoons, what are some good jigging techniques/baits that I should look out for?"
160461,bucktail,2008-02-14 04:06:00,1857,"Due to the fact that Lakers are generaly spread out in the spring time, slowing down to jig may be couunter productive. Grab a pair of inlines and cover some water until you contact fish, maybe then start thinking about concentrating on the spot."
160470,johnnyb,2008-02-14 04:43:00,3413,"A friend of mine who lives close enough to a decent laker fishery to be able to fish it daily right after ice out finds success every year with spinners -- he uses Panther Martens in 10-30 feet of water right after the ice is gone. If you were jigging, I'd be going with a nice 2.5-3"" tube jig, in white.  Tipped with a minnow.  Good luck!"
160533,singingdog,2008-02-14 13:51:00,1047,You can cover water just as fast with a jig as you can with an inline - or any other lure. I have very good luck while they are shallow on bucktails and rabbit jigs tied to imitate minnows. Another killer is the Yam swim jig body on a jig head. Fish it like a grub.
160565,Bob Devine,2008-02-14 15:28:00,251,"Don't be afraid to try drop shotting too. We were in Algonquin last spring  fishing 75' of H2O and the drop shot rig pulled a number of fish. We also jigged with spoons and round jigs and plastic minnows, all techniques were successful."
160688,Joeytier,2008-02-14 21:20:00,3990,Thanks for all the tips!
160719,Bob,2008-02-14 23:00:00,370,I've had my best spring laker fishing here towing body baits.  Anything that's shaped like a smelt will do.  Floating rapalas ainbow trout pattern are especially successful for me.  I've had good days with Bomber Long As as well and Ripplin' Redfins often work well too.
160721,Cast Adventures,2008-02-14 23:02:00,74,"Jigging for Lake Trout in open water can be very productive with good electronics and clam conditions. There are several different baits we use in the Niagara River and Lake Ontario. Bucktail jigs, jigging spoons, 3-to-5‚Äùplastic grubs/shads, Salted or live minnows fished on a jig head. Depending on depths were fishing, we use weights up to 2oz. Experiment with different colours and presentations in your area for best results."
160737,troutologist,2008-02-15 00:17:00,951,"Depending on how close to ice out you get casting with tube jigs, 1/2oz bucktails and 4"" storm swim baits is productive. 5-30 fow off points, shoals and river mouths has been good. I really like trolling upriver into mouth with spoons or cranks. (If the flow isnt too strong try a flat fish, lazy wobble is killer on spring lakers) then drifting back jigging. Narrows are anywhere theres current will work.  Dont overlook sandy bays, as was previously stated you have to cover water until you find the temp the fish are holding at.  Look for anything in the low to mid 40's early in the year.Last spring the deep diving xrap was the world beater in white, and sand flats from 10-25 fow where the place. Really temp dependent, the location didnt matter so much as the temp.  When the fish go deeper, late may/june here, use electronics to mark fish off points or on secondary drops into the main basin. then you can jig. white tube, bucktail, and experiment with heavy chunk spoons (hopkins) or flutter spoons (williams, cleos) depending on theyre mood. Also as weird as it sounds try jigging a #3 or 4 spinner....  im rambling now but im pumped now about spring trout...."
160775,Joeytier,2008-02-15 03:20:00,3990,"Wow, thanks!"
160861,Bob Devine,2008-02-15 17:30:00,251,"Joey, Extreme Angler TV has Dave Kennedy doing the drop shot for lakers this Sat on OLN at 9:30am and again at 12 noon. Dave shows you how he uses his electronics to find the fish and then he jigs them up."
160900,cityfisher,2008-02-15 21:46:00,959,Excellent info guys !
160916,Jigger,2008-02-15 23:04:00,1237,"I'm surprised no-one has mentioned lipless cranks yet. One of my favourite approaches for spring trout. Like troutologist said, look for current areas. Also sand flats are good too. I look for expansive flats that drop fairly quickly into deeper water. Fish can be anywhere depthwise, so I like to hang out over deep water and keep an eye on the finder to see if theres any action off the structure. The cranks really turn them on. Use ones with lots of sound. I like the 3/4oz Berkly Frenzy, casts like a bullet and makes TONS of racket!!!  Thanks for the heads up Bob D. I'll be watching that for sure. I've tried drop-shotting with limited success and think it would be a great technique in anyones bag of tricks."
