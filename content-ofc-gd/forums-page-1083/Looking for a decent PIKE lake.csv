160113,bassman,2008-02-13 13:48:00,384,Can't go wrong with Cooks Bay.
160166,Rizzo,2008-02-13 15:57:00,4754,"Kahshe has got lots of pike, although out of the 3 or 4 times I've been there they've all been in the 2-4 lb range."

160247,tdotfisherman,2008-02-13 19:57:00,317,"In the spring, late summer, and early fall time, the Northern Pike fishing in parts of Georgian Bay is fantastic. Big Pike come shallow into the numerous weedy bays and put on the feedbag something decent.. Try around Point Au Baril, I've had success around there in personal experiences.."

160360,mattyk,2008-02-14 00:19:00,2110,I would go with Cooks bay.
160375,JerseyDog,2008-02-14 00:42:00,190,"250k lakes in ontario. 245k of them have good to great pike fishing. the rest, its only fair."
160472,FishHeadRic,2008-02-14 05:04:00,226,Lake Ontario ain't to shabby.   Little Vermillion comes to mind as well.  FHR
160477,Garry2Rs,2008-02-14 06:15:00,1425,"If that was Jack's Lake at Apsley that you're talking about, I have lived there for five years and have never seen a Pike...caught some good Musky, but no Pike. Chandos is in the same area, but is connected to the Crowe River system and has good Pike fishing. Garry2rs"
