This will enable me to get everything for a weekend campout in one trip. Not sure what I was doing, and after some pointers from Wayne ( Irishfield ) ( thanks btw. ) I came up with this idea. It is still not 100% completed - I want to add some fish decals and also a rack for on top to carry my Guide portable, but it is atleast usable.  Here it is:       Thanks for all the ideas guys!  Don"

161026,Mike the Pike,2008-02-16 12:21:00,3421,Very nice Don have you told the wife yet.Are you going to put beside all the other toys.  I bet you could sell icecream and slush with that set up  .Nice paint job.  Now fill it up with stuff Don you are really due for a fish filled report with LOTS of fish pics.

161042,ccmtcanada,2008-02-16 14:06:00,7971,Wow...that's sweet Don!  Looks like lots of room for storage for everything you'll need out there.  You'll have to include it in your next report!
161058,Smokey,2008-02-16 14:52:00,1278,Great job. That should do you well and nice having it covered to prevent it from loading up with snow along the way and thru the day.  Good Luck with it
161104,iceguy,2008-02-16 22:07:00,341,Nice sled! Just some hole of the bottom fish out it. Real nice job.
