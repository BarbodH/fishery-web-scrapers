160730,Rich Clemens,2008-02-14 23:46:00,3131,  I had subscribed to Canadian Geographic for a couple years and really enjoyed the pics and the articles.  Unfortunately the cost for a US subscription was a little prohibitive for me at the time.  May have to check on getting another.
160754,Dave Frasso,2008-02-15 01:32:00,20,"Never run out of reading material Bassmasters, FLW Outdoors, Bass & Walleye Boats, Ontario Out of Doors, Musky Hunter, OFAH,  During the winter all the fishing shows on the 2 different TV Satellites Along with 8 Fishing Forums throughout Canada & U.S.A.  There is always something to learn, you really never stop learning"
160586,Beans,2008-02-14 16:06:00,3339,"Just one...The North American Fisherman (the club)...  I enjoy seeing all the new gadgets they get people to field test including the ones they sent me...They must have taken me off the field test list when I sent in a report on their knotless hooks and said what a piece of crap I thought they were...  They also keep wanting me to sign up as a lifetime member and receive the swell rod and reel and carrying case...I keep telling them ""No thanks"" at the age of 72 it would be just my luck to croak shortly after joining...  The wife gets several but I find Reader's Digest to be the best of the lot..."
160595,bbog,2008-02-14 16:22:00,665,"I get Ontario Out of Doors as part of my OFAH membership. Getting it this way provides me with monthly updates of the OFAH activities. Read In-Fisherman, Outdoor Canada and Real Fishing from time to time but don't subscribe."
160611,Moosebunk,2008-02-14 16:54:00,3970,"Canadian Fly Fisher - used to read it more, but not so much now.  I did like it for the fly patterns and articles on fishing destinations that are more ""fly fishing"" specific.  Still a good mag, great look, but I think I won't renew next time and maybe wait and see if down the road I get more into fly fishing.  Real Fishing - last two issues I read I thoroughly enjoyed.  I'd almost cancelled this subscription though, simply because I was finding it more product plugged than others.  It drives me nuts reading articles about everyday fishing but which the baits and gear mentioned in the articles is ALWAYS a known magazine sponsor.  It makes you wonder how ""REAL"" Real Fishing actually is.  That said, a number of good articles in the last couple issues kept me reading front to back without disappointment.  (Specifically, How I became a Fishing Resort Owner.  That was something interesting and different)  Ontario Out of Doors - Always liked this magazine... it's Ontario.  OutDoor Canada - Never dissappoints.  I really enjoy travel-destination articles on far off fishing destinations in this country.  Esox Angler - I gobble up everything they publish on pike fishing.  I also read anything walleye related that is not big water trolling based... it just doesn't apply to me right now.  The muskie info is great and so I often read much of it, even though I don't fish them.  DestinationFish - I just got one free in the mail and I'm so far impressed.  The title says it all.  It's a billionaires guide to fishing the world, loaded with adds for Rolex's, Ocean Front Real Estate, Yachts... it's nuts, but interesting.  I now want to fish Great Barrier Reef with this one yacht outfit... problem is, for a week it's like $20,000... but they'll put you on hundreds of fish, like marlin, wahoo, giant trevally and tuna.  All week long."
160617,lew,2008-02-14 17:06:00,12767," Hey Moose, you've also written some incredible articles for Esox Angler too and have added alot to that magazine.  Hope it continues for you."
160700,fishdawg,2008-02-14 21:52:00,912,"Ontario Fisherman was my favourite back in the day... currently subscribe to Ontario Out Of Doors - great allround mag for the Ontario hunter & angler  I also read Great Lakes Angler, Walleye Insider, Essox Angler, Outdoor Canada & IN-Fisherman on occassion  I easily have quite a collection of over 15 various mags, probably 300-400 total?  love reading old issues and looking back on things...  I agree tho, North American Fishing Club is a joke"
160727,kennyman,2008-02-14 23:38:00,737,"I only subscribe to Ontario Out Of Doors, but at the Fishing Show I might grab a couple of the year end or ""special"" Outdoors Canada"" mags. My best deal always come at the local orchestra's book drive where I believe mags are 5 or 10 cents. I got two boxes full last year for the price of one off the newsstand."
