160675,TennesseeGuy,2008-02-14 20:33:00,957,Team racing is better than struggling with Wicked Stepmother.
160681,Deano,2008-02-14 20:49:00,767,"Great start for the season, should be a great year for JR. looking forward to the Daytona race."
160712,Daplumma,2008-02-14 22:42:00,1961,"Two questions already answered before the season even gets underway. Will JR win this year? Yes Will Toyota win this year? Yes. Pressure is off for Toyota and JR. I was hoping Carpentier would make it into the show,he will be just fine this year I think. Tomorrow night is the truck race,the best racing in NASCAR.Go Johnny Benson. Joe"
