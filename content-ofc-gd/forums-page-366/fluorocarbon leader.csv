730392,backbay,2012-09-17 02:00:00,773,I've had good luck with the Albright knot when tying braid to flouro.....
730399,dylan21,2012-09-17 02:23:00,22,"the best line to line knot is the ALBRIGHT. Very simple yet very effective, all you have to do it wet it then tighten. I use this all the time and never fails. http://videofishingknots.com/albright-knot.html  hope this helps"
730434,singingdog,2012-09-17 10:46:00,1047,"I wonder why 10 lb flouro for a leader? It's stronger than your main line, but not strong enough to fend off toothy critters. If you believe that you need it for decreased visibility (don't get me started on flouro and invisibility), going with 10 lb over 6 or 8 lb seems to defeat that purpose, while making knot tying more difficult.  I don't understand the angst over a uni-uni connection. It's easy to tie - it can be done in about a minute - and I have never broken off a well-tied uni-uni. Next best is a triple surgeons knot, which is even easier to tie, and just slightly less reliable. Lots of big, hard fighting fish have been landed on triple surgeon knots on fly gear."
730522,singingdog,2012-09-17 16:05:00,1047," Thanks. I've never had that problem with jerkbaits, but have with WTD topwaters. I'll try it."
730524,Djeep,2012-09-17 16:15:00,199,"one knot i havent seen mentioned that is very handy when tying different diameter lines is the slim beauty. its a salwater knot and I find it is not too hard to tie and works great for tying on heavy flouro leaders. give it a try, better than uni to uni imo."
730525,Harrison,2012-09-17 16:16:00,2202,Palomar is all you need for everything.  You can get fancy and use a trilene knot on a body bait if you are not using a snap.  Triple surgeon here for braid to flouro. Never had an issue.
730533,EC1,2012-09-17 16:48:00,930,"Let me be the party pooper. I don't think your knot had any problem, you just skimped out the coin on FC line. I think Stren Fluorocast is TERRIBLE. I had 17# and it broke in all sorts of weird ways that I couldn't explain. You also can't go wrong with any of the knots that the others told you above.  With FC, I find the ratio for money : performance is key. IMO, if you're not paying close to 20 bucks (or more) for a spool of FC, you won't get good quality. Maybe someone can prove me wrong, but I'll stick with what I have now and not complain about mysterious breaks."
730535,gordy28,2012-09-17 16:54:00,638,"I have success using the San Diego Jam knot to tie flouro directly to your bait (believe it was in an article by Aaron Martins) To connect braid to flouro I use the Seaguar knot - one lesson for me, know more than 3 twists of the loops of you connection knot is to big  Gordy"
730583,siwash,2012-09-17 20:06:00,683, It is  a real hard knot.. stead hands and patience... hard to due if it's raw and bumpy while out on the water...  Power Pro has it on there site...

730594,Fish Farmer,2012-09-17 20:39:00,2234,"If your main line is braid and your leader is flouro 15LB. or bigger, tie a UNI around the flouro with the braid then melt your flouro end with a match, it will make a ball on the end, then cinch your braid."
730597,Christopheraaron,2012-09-17 20:47:00,3525," Not sure what problem you guys have with it? I've found it quick and easy to tie, also a very, very strong knot."
730647,MCTFisher9120,2012-09-18 00:07:00,3761,uni to uni knot all the way.
730657,RickOnt,2012-09-18 00:30:00,669,"""It all comes down to what you can tie confidently, repeatedly and reliably.""  Exactly!! Rick"
730686,Bernie66,2012-09-18 01:38:00,123,"You should take a look at a video series online called  ""Knot War"".  It pegs knot against knot in terms of break strength in various situations from terminal tackle connection to joining braid to leader.  In their comparison of the uni to uni against modified albright in 2010, the modified albright won by an amazing 2.5lbs in break strength on 15lbs fluoro. (the uni broke at 10.5lbs and the m-albright at 13lbs) They even have animations to teach you how to tie the knots.  There is also a sebile knot out there that is suppose to have 100% breakstrength on leader to braid connection. Take a look and decide which knot is for you.  Its a fine balance between what is easier to tie and the knot strength.  I've been using the mod albright for the last few years(with a drop of superglue) and have not had a single knot failure even on fresh pier chinnies up to 30lbs but I am always looking for better knots."
730693,Joeytier,2012-09-18 02:15:00,3990,"To the OP, it may have something to do with the fact that Stren Fluorocast is TERRIBLE.  I've never used such a brittle, terrible casting line in my life."
730783,jedimaster,2012-09-18 15:40:00,3472,uni to uni to joining two lines together palamar for drop shot Improved clinch for everything else  I can't even recall the last time I have had a line break from a fish on a knot.
730789,kickingfrog,2012-09-18 16:06:00,8333,I was on one line's web site and it mentioned the importance of wetting the line before finishing knots (not new to most) but also mentioned using chapstik as an option. Personally I don't think I'm likely to do that on the water but I'll definitely do that the next time I'm pre-tying leaders at home.
730926,Cloudy15,2012-09-18 22:56:00,141,"  Err havnt actually used that line yet, just grabbed it. Only planned on using it for leaders. Sounds like it was a poor choice. for the albirght does it matter if your collies are loose? in the demo's i saw they used rope and collied it very tight before cinching??"
730933,backbay,2012-09-18 23:13:00,773," Best to keep it ""tidy"" and draw it closed slowly and uniformly as you tighten it. Funny, sometimes I used the improved with overlapping coils, but when I tie the regular Albright, I'm careful that they don't...."
730230,Cloudy15,2012-09-16 18:42:00,141,After reading the thread on line choice. I bought stren soinic braid 8lb 300yrds 32 bucks didnt seem like a great price and also bought stren fluorocast 10lb for my leader. Curious how you attach your fluorocarbon leader. I used a barrel swivel in the past with the plamer knot and found i was breaking off alot. I was curious is this line combo would make a good drop shot rig?  thanks
730234,davey buoy,2012-09-16 18:52:00,5505,"Is this a float rod?,if so i personally use a micro swivel under the float and than use a clinch knot for the leader from that to the hook.I'm sure you'll get a lot of great ideas."
730236,Richard S.,2012-09-16 18:58:00,75,Sorry though it was under a float.   Rich.
730237,Cloudy15,2012-09-16 18:58:00,141,"  no not a float rod, dont have one never tried it. Sounds like i migh tbe missing out. Thanks for the responce"
730240,davey buoy,2012-09-16 19:09:00,5505, You can still use the same procedure. The idea is to make the line as invisible as possible. Two lines together is a different knot.
730244,BillM,2012-09-16 19:38:00,17367,Improved clinch or palomar.
730247,mercman,2012-09-16 19:47:00,7054,"Regular cinch or palomar.Remember to lubricate the Fluro before tightening the knot.That may be why you are getting breakoffs.I usually use saliva to lubricate just before tightening. One thing to consider.The flouro for leader material is a bit stiffer than flouro meant for mainline.Although some use mainline as leader material, i don't."
730269,Cloudy15,2012-09-16 21:42:00,141," Hmm never did wet my palomar knot, annoying if thats all it was. if using the palomar not your using some kind of swivel to joing the two lines... is it better to tie the lines direct? thanks for the tip!"
730273,Christopheraaron,2012-09-16 21:54:00,3525,"I'll join them directly, I can't remember the name but it's basically two overhand knots that slide together, I'm sure  someone will know the name."
730276,mercman,2012-09-16 21:59:00,7054,"  Honestly, i dont think it matters to the fish either way. I Tie my flouro to a tiny very good quality chain swivel,with a regular cinch knot. i tie the Braid to the other eye on the chain swivel with a palomar knot. I give myself about 18 inches of flouro, and tie a snap, not a snap swivel, to the end of my leader, useing a cinch knot again. I always use snaps, and no one can convince me that tieing direct to lures catches more fish.Fish dont give a dang how your lure is attached to your line, and i have produced as many if not more fish than the people i fish with, who tie direct.I use the smallest terminal tackle that i can get away with, for the fish i am targeting. Always lubricate flouro.It tends to heat up slightly as it pulls across itself during the tightening of the knot."
730277,mercman,2012-09-16 22:00:00,7054,  uni to uni a real pain in the   to tie
730278,Christopheraaron,2012-09-16 22:03:00,3525," I've found it quite simple, the one you don't want to have to tie is the nail knot."
730285,davey buoy,2012-09-16 22:16:00,5505, You need the nail knot for two different sized lines!
730287,BillM,2012-09-16 22:18:00,17367," I've tied some stupid stuff together with the Uni-Uni, lol!  And if it's that much of a difference, I'll use a XXXS barrel swivel."
730296,Moosebunk,2012-09-16 22:31:00,3970,Uni to Uni for pretty much every connection.  If the leader is a really thick diameter then an albright.
730299,kickingfrog,2012-09-16 22:34:00,8333," It's not the fish that it matters to, it's your line and line guides. On a baitcasting outfit where I'm not nearly as concerned about line twist it is almost always line to line (if I bother using a floruo leader). On a spinning set-up if there is a possibility of line twist I'll use a small float swivel and even then I hate to reel it through the tiptop, but invariably do."
730301,manitoubass2,2012-09-16 22:40:00,11391,"I would never reel a swivel through the guides, lol.  I use a pretty short leader (when I do use one), usually around 14"".  I tie my mainline to a good quality barrel swivel (I prefer Spro). I use a palomar  I use a palomar or double palomar when I attach the fluoro to the barrel swivel.  Anytime I attach two lines together, its uni to uni. Then I'll use a pretty long leader, really just prevnt retying a bunch of times throughout the day. IMO, uni to uni is pretty simple, but it becomes a pain in crappy weather while in the boat. I'll do it, but I'd just rather not.  Always moisten your knots good, and I find it helps to cinch the knot slowly, whereas some people really tighten it down hard and fast."
730312,Cloudy15,2012-09-16 23:01:00,141,Thanks everyone why isnt there ever just one correct answer:)
730316,davey buoy,2012-09-16 23:12:00,5505," I guess you find one you like and works well and away you go.Your right,nothings easy.lol."
730318,SlowPoke,2012-09-16 23:16:00,2984,I use the nail knot almost exclusively. It's easy with a Tie-Fast knot tying tool.
730320,kickingfrog,2012-09-16 23:18:00,8333, Different strokes and different conditions/situations.
730321,Dutch,2012-09-16 23:18:00,831,"Uni-to-uni is a pain in the arse to tie for using leaders.  I use a triple surgeon's knot and haven't had too many issues at all.  Very easy to tie.  Also - the conventional view is to NOT use a palomar knot for flouro.  I stopped using it after I was breaking off far too often.  I'd always break off at the terminal knot, not at the surgeons, which is what should really break first.  I started using a uni knot, but through the eye twice and my break off issue stopped soon after."
730324,BillM,2012-09-16 23:21:00,17367,"That's the reason I no longer use the clinch knot for flouro and use the improved clinch instead.  Had way too many hooks pulls loose with that knot.  Maybe it's operator error, who knows!"
730329,RickOnt,2012-09-16 23:30:00,669,"For Braid to leader I use an 'Albright'  To snaps or Jigs, Improved Clinch/Trilene. Whatever you like to call it!  Rick"
730333,Christopheraaron,2012-09-16 23:41:00,3525, Oh I know it's just a horrible knot to have to tie.
