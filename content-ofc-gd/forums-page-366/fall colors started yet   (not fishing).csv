730758,rob v,2012-09-18 14:52:00,535,My wife and I are planning to spend the weekend in huntsville this weekend and hope to take a drive/hike through parts of algonquin or arrowehead provincial park.   According to the ontario parks website the colors are just nicely getting started (40-45% color changed).  I know there's people on this board from that area - will this weekend (sept 22) be too early ?  or should I wait another week and go the weekend of the 29th ?    Any first hand knoweldge /current condition info would be much appreciated.  Thanks

730764,woodenboater,2012-09-18 15:03:00,2277,Just came back and I'm not sure I'd say 40-45%. Some areas (further east) were coming out and don't imagine much change in a day or two. We had near freezing temps on Sat which probably started the process. Also not sure how dynamic it will be since it's been a relatively dry summer.

730805,fishindevil,2012-09-18 16:35:00,6254,thanksgiving weekend is always primo in the awesome ottawa river valley !!! and the east end of the park...
730811,rob v,2012-09-18 16:53:00,535,thanks guys - looks like I'll wait another week.  weather isn't supposed to be so good this weekend anyways.  I was just a bit worried about things happening too fast/early (season for just about everything is early and short this year).
730960,singingdog,2012-09-19 00:31:00,1047,Just starting here in Haliburton. No real colour yet.
730980,Rod Caster,2012-09-19 01:34:00,5784,Up towards temiskaming the colors are getting quite dramitic... Add in tonights 0 degree temps and they'll be in full wilt mode.
