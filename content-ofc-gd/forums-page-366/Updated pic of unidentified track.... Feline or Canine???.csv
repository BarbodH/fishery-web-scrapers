731059,Harrison,2012-09-19 13:15:00,2202,"Was thinking Lynx too Roy.  Definitely feline I believe.  If it was a bit further north, I'd say cougar maybe."
731086,fishnsled,2012-09-19 14:52:00,3520,"The bottom print and the right toe seems to have a hole that would be make from a claw. On the upper print it looks like the right claw scraped down and a hole for the next one, tough to say for the next 2. Tough to say but seems to be more similar to a feline.  Wolf, Coyote, and Cougar tracks  Lynx  Cougar"
731097,siwash,2012-09-19 15:07:00,683,"  To clarify, the poop was taken several hundred yards away in a totally different location.  I did not intend to conclude that the poop came from the animal(s) that made the tracks. They were taken on the same day so I lumped them together...  The scat still looks like bear poop to me.. for the poster who said berries should be in the scat, what if berries are not part of the bear's diet in that location?  It appeared to be vegetation (grasses?) as I broke it apart with a stick to see what it had eaten.. It was fairly fresh (maybe several hours?)  The tracks were found along a sandy trail.  This was taken in a county forest neat the town of Baxter.. there's a Christmas tree farm about a mile away...   Are there lynx in Simcoe County?  I heard that there was a cougar(s) sighting recently nearby... by two hikers... they heard more than one animal claimed the animals were ""tracking"" them"

731103,bassman87,2012-09-19 15:26:00,586,do you have a fascination with crap? based on your dp and this thread lol
731108,siwash,2012-09-19 15:49:00,683,  LOL! Best way to ID animals outside of seeing them! I am always looking out for tracks and crap...
731132,bare foot wader,2012-09-19 17:57:00,1354,"the toe pads are fairly round but without seeing the tracks up close it's tough to call...overall they resemble a cat print, but it does look like there are nail marks above the toe pads and that's throwing me off, they also look fairly small so not likely a cougar but they could be right with a smaller cat...something to establish scale would help next time you find tracks  the tracks looks fairly old...was the area muddy previously or on a steep grade? I've seen cat tracks using their claws climbing an embankment or muddy areas"
731142,jimmer,2012-09-19 18:21:00,2730,I saw a pile of crap like that on a Hoarders show I watched the other night! Could it be?
731158,ehg,2012-09-19 19:22:00,2666," Judging by the pic in your avatar, i think it was deposited by the former cougar who lives in the van down by the river there."
731160,misfish,2012-09-19 19:25:00,29133," In this area and surounding area,there are bob cats (seen and have heard them) .Lots of black bears in the borden area,which will travel many miles.   The distance between the two prints,is to close to be a yote or wolf.Also a yote will be alot narrower.Smaller foot print."
730928,siwash,2012-09-18 23:01:00,683,Scroll down to see track!!  
730930,Joeytier,2012-09-18 23:06:00,3990,Looks like a young samsquench to me...yikes!
730932,GBW,2012-09-18 23:13:00,8460,the pic's are so small I say manbearpig!
730934,NAW,2012-09-18 23:14:00,4022,Roughly where did you find these tracks?  Looks like a wolf or coyote to me.  Not 100% sure about the scat though.
730935,siwash,2012-09-18 23:15:00,683,ok...  anyone else?
730936,siwash,2012-09-18 23:17:00,683,  12 km east of Barrie.. a little north of Aliston..   I am pretty sure it's bear... just wanted confirmation... 5 inches by 4 for the bear poop..  the tracks are puzzling... no toe claws (i.e. retracted like a cat)
730937,Cookslav,2012-09-18 23:18:00,1457,"Coyote... The Claw marks indicate canine tracks(cats claws are retractable) Size matters though...could be a wolf or just a wild dog.  Tough to judge the size from the pics, and the hind print is barely visible."
730938,Cookslav,2012-09-18 23:19:00,1457, like I said its hard to tell from the pics but they look pointed to me?
730945,bucktail,2012-09-19 00:01:00,1857,Poo is definalty bear!!!
730953,Cookslav,2012-09-19 00:16:00,1457,"Poo sure, but I don't think the tracks are though? Not enough toes, and any pad imprint visible is to small. The spread of the toes seem to long as opposed to wide and the toes are to pointed to be bear?  http://www.google.ca/imgres?q=black+bear+track&hl=en&client=firefox-a&hs=pqT&sa=X&rls=org.mozilla:en-GB:official&channel=s&biw=1107&bih=672&tbm=isch&prmd=imvns&tbnid=1e53Qm6uN1v6WM:&imgrefurl=http://www.gvta.on.ca/bears.html&docid=B2eVCT4R3_9ygM&imgurl=http://www.gvta.on.ca/images/blackbearpaws.gif&w=300&h=185&ei=IA5ZUP3eGoSJ0QHnuoGYBA&zoom=1&iact=hc&vpx=576&vpy=173&dur=5436&hovh=148&hovw=240&tx=150&ty=89&sig=104760614415804747058&page=1&tbnh=110&tbnw=178&start=0&ndsp=18&ved=1t:429,r:3,s:0,i:82  I still say Coyote or Wolf."
730955,fishinguypat,2012-09-19 00:21:00,547,Definitely Geese
730962,siwash,2012-09-19 00:33:00,683,"  The tracks are NOT bear. I didn't mean to say they are. Poop is bear, but unfortunately the pics of the tracks don't do justice... If you look carefully at the last picture, you might be able to make out what I am saying... more cat like... probably just my mind playing tricks on me!  Bears are apparently in that area... wolf not so sure... probably just yotes"
730964,tomO,2012-09-19 00:39:00,363,whats it taste like?
730968,STJ,2012-09-19 00:50:00,12,"Print is coyote or fox depending on size, most likely coyote. How large is the pile of scat,"
730989,siwash,2012-09-19 01:57:00,683," Coyote size prints!!  Scat is biggish... 5"" x 4""ish..."
731015,largemouthtrout,2012-09-19 04:21:00,53,"Haha .. when you open the pics they come out smaller ... I can,t really make them out with my bad eye .  I would say if the back of the heel has 2 buldges , its a dog type print ..  If it has 3 bulges at the back of the heel , its a cat type print .  Thats my guess ."
731023,Sinker,2012-09-19 08:57:00,8692,"Those tracks are kinda looking feline-ish, but its hard to tell from pics. I have no doubt in my mind there are cougars around though. I wouldn't be surprised at all.  S."
731030,siwash,2012-09-19 10:28:00,683, Is this better?  This to me looks more cat-like.... I cannot make out claws.. can you? 
731033,siwash,2012-09-19 10:49:00,683, I have more pics... it's just a bit odd if you ask me... does not look like a canine print. These tracks were about 3.75 x 3.75 (roughly)
731034,skeeter,2012-09-19 10:55:00,1907,Cougar ?
731036,siwash,2012-09-19 11:14:00,683,"  BINGO.. That is what I am wondering.... I know lots of you don't think they exist, but this doesn't look like a dog print and it ain't no kitty cat..."
731040,lew,2012-09-19 11:50:00,12766,"Just for comparison, here's some pictures of fresh bear tracks I just took a few minutes ago out in front of my house. You can see the toe prints but no sign of claws.        And here's some fresh poop mixed in with the tracks so I'm assuming it's also from the bear.  We had alot of rain here yesterday so these tracks were probably made early this morning before any cars obliterated them.   "
731041,bare foot wader,2012-09-19 11:58:00,1354,"cougar tracks for comparison  those pics are small, but it looks like there are nail marks in the upper print in the pic...I'd guess coyote "
731044,doubleheader,2012-09-19 12:05:00,497,"Tracks do not look look bear to me nor does the scat, which this time of year is nearly always filled with berries. Could be bobcat, I can't tell the size."
731055,Roy,2012-09-19 12:58:00,13728,I'll submit that it was a lynx. The scat did not necessarily come from that animal.
