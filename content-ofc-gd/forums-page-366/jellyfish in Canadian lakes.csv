731367,GBW,2012-09-20 14:56:00,8460,we had seen some a few years ago on lake Kashawigamog and we swore that's what they were.
731368,fishnsled,2012-09-20 14:56:00,3520,I saw a bunch (100's) on Kashawigamog several years ago. All were about the size of a dime and have never seen them there or anywhere else since.  Edit - Funny how you saw them there as well Geoff.
731373,GBW,2012-09-20 15:16:00,8460,Too funny that we both posted about the same sight on the same lake AT the same time.  when I had seen them they were between a dime to a quarter in size.

731388,Jigger,2012-09-20 16:33:00,1237,"A buddy of mine has a cottage out near Kingston. The lake he's on was infested with thousands of jellies this year. I have a pic at home of a couple that he brought home. Pretty cool looking. Heres a link from the US, but its the Jelly in question.  http://nas.er.usgs.gov/queries/factsheet.aspx?SpeciesID=1068"
731392,Sinker,2012-09-20 17:04:00,8692,I've also seen them on Kash.......I thought I was losing it LOL  S.

731462,jjcanoe,2012-09-20 23:50:00,744,"a few lakes north of Kingston seem to have them, I've seen a few up that way as well."
731469,Rich,2012-09-21 00:32:00,3927,Deer creek conservation area is on the list ! I'm really amazed by that. Haven't seen one in 10 years there but ill certainly be on the lookout now. That is awesome!
731484,big guy,2012-09-21 01:24:00,414,"I can't believe I came on here and saw an article about this. Just yesterday I was fishing in Long Schooner Lake north of Plevna, was casting off a rock/weed shoal, looked down in the water and saw something that looked like a jellyfish. Then I see the picture in the link of the jellyfish beside the American penny, that is exactly what I saw, though it looked to be about the size of a quarter in the water.  I guess what I wasn't seeing things after all."
731525,singingdog,2012-09-21 09:35:00,1047,"Banner year for them here in Haliburton. Over the years I would see them in a lake maybe once in 5 years. This year, I have seen them in at least 5 different lakes."
731541,mistaredone,2012-09-21 13:28:00,913,I saw a bloom of them on Baptiste Lake about 7 years ago
