Dave reaches into his tackle box and pulls out a lighter 11 inches long. Matt looks at it and asks, “Where did you get this?”  Dave: I got it from my genie. Matt: You have a genie? Dave: Yup! He’s in the tackle box. Matt: Let’s see. Dave opens the box and calls out the genie. Instantly he appears. Matt is amazed and instantly says to the genie. “Genie grant ME a wish. Genie: Sure! What shall it be? Matt: I want a million bucks! Genie: So it shall be!  The genie disappears into the tackle box. A couple of minutes later the sky grows dark and the loud thunder of quacking can be heard overhead. Disappointed Matt turns to Dave and says, “What gives? I asked for a million BUCKS not a million DUCKS!”  Dave: Oh I forgot to tell you that the genie has a hearing problem! Do you really think I asked for an 11 inch BIC???"
