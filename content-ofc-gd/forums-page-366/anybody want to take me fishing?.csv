730661,redpearl99,2012-09-18 00:37:00,259,I'm wondering if anyone is going salmon fishing this weekend and has an extra spot open.  I'm a student and don't have enough money for my own boat but I've always wanted to go out on lake ontario.
730697,snagged,2012-09-18 02:32:00,67,zero views when I clicked on this lol be patient and maybe a spot will pop up. good luck
730813,aplumma,2012-09-18 16:55:00,6896,You can add a description and a picture or two to show people who you are. An offer of lunch or a little gas money or what ever you have to sell yourself would help also. I think if you can make someone feel like they kind of know you then the invites will be forthcoming. There is nothing worse than getting trapped on a boat with someone who cant carry on a conversation or has very different views on the world than oneself.  Good luck   Art

730827,Christopheraaron,2012-09-18 17:52:00,3525," I've been going out with red quite often, really friendly guy, he's been telling me for a while now that he wants to learn from some of the guys on here. definitely not an antisocial."
730849,davey buoy,2012-09-18 19:34:00,5505," Maybe a nice guy but,a little about yourself goes a long way. It can be a long day without the right company. Just sayin!. A little gas money also helps a lot as mentioned. Good luck."

731268,redpearl99,2012-09-20 01:24:00,259,"So i've been fishing for all my life but I've been getting more into it lately.  I use to go salmon fishing with my dad at Port Credit when I was younger but have never been out on the lake before (which is weird because I have my boating license).  During the week I work at a corporate / litigation law firm in downtown T.O.  I would be happy to get lunch for the boat or pitch in gas money.  If there are two spots open then maybe Christopher could come along as well.  Let me know, and this pic is from my last outing with Christopher   "
731276,GBW,2012-09-20 01:37:00,8460,"No wonder everyone jumped on you right away, you work in litigation at a law firm... sorry, ex-Bay St. guy I just had to..."
731278,GBW,2012-09-20 01:41:00,8460,"PS, name and location for folks considering the offer would be good too...  just saying..."
731282,i2cool2fool,2012-09-20 01:46:00,349,"I guess I better not mention I work for a bank... Opps.  Redpearl: best of luck. If you want to meet up for bass/pike in Long Point Bay next year or perch in Erie, look me up. Maybe we can get out."
731290,Christopheraaron,2012-09-20 02:26:00,3525," Hope he does't mind, richmond hill area."
731316,blaque,2012-09-20 11:42:00,2419,I feel like we need an e-Harmony section on the forum after reading this.
731363,tb4me,2012-09-20 14:44:00,3295,"Lol I was thinking the same thing..Here is my sons E harmony spoof..Will this one do? lol  <iframe width=""560"" height=""315"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/UXdNZLMQEv4"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>"

731523,chris.brock,2012-09-21 09:04:00,4053,"that pike hold has become outdated, not long after the ""fingers in the eye sockets"" hold was not cool anymore"
731553,pics,2012-09-21 15:00:00,1268, Does the fish have a good case here???
731554,Christopheraaron,2012-09-21 15:03:00,3525," Not the greatest hold yes, but we kept the fish so no extra harm could've been done."
731555,BillM,2012-09-21 15:06:00,17367," Just squeeze the gill plates, no reason to put your fingers on the inside."
731558,adolson,2012-09-21 15:10:00,783, It's a pike... Just shake your rod until it falls off the hook and back into the water.
731561,BillM,2012-09-21 15:14:00,17367, You gotta stop catching snot rockets
731585,pics,2012-09-21 17:16:00,1268,Pike are great to eat provided you can get rid of the bones.....
