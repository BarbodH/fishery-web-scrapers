I just got into ice fishing three winters ago and fell in love with it.  My first year, I built an 8x4 hut out of scrap 3/8"" chip board I had lying around and put it in Scugog. Did the job but didn't last me more than one winter because it rotted out over the summer. Fishing was OK, caught lots of crappie and a few walleye. Bought a Mr. buddy portable heater to heat the hut and it did a fantastic job.  I bought a portable CLAM pop-up on sale for $180 that I used the past two seasons on a number of different lakes and although it did the job, it was a piece of junk. It ripped on me after the wind got a hold of it and snapped one of the poles. It's a 6x6x6. Can fish 3 guys in it, but I want something bigger thats going to last me more than two seasons.  This year I plan on putting a permanent on Rice and using my portable for when I travel to fish other lakes. The plan is to make it 8x6, insulated and durable!  I contacted a guy on Kijiji who does building demolitions that had some insulation for sale. He was selling 4x8 sheets of 2"" insulation, R-12 for $12/sheet. These go for $25/sheet at home depot and are only R-8.  When I got to his house I noticed he had a bunch of sheet metal that was torn down from an old barn. So I grabbed enough to side the walls and roof of my hut in this stuff. Its way lighter than the 3/8"" plywood I was originally planning to use. Just gonna have to rust paint it. Got enough insulation to do the floors, walls and roof plus siding for $200 total!  I am going to make my ski's out of two 2x6s bolted together and cover the bottom of them with some puck board I got from a friend who works at a hockey rink. Should make it real slick on the ice/ snow.  Going to frame it out of 2x4s and spray foam any cracks to make it air tight.  I grabbed an exterior door on my way home from picking up the insulation. Someone was throwing it away along highway 28.  Will keep the build process updated on here. Ive attached two pics of the insulation and siding.  My question is, who on this site has a hut and do you have any suggestions/ tips you can give me? I am still undecided on what I want my interior set up to be like. Would also love to see some pics of your hut.  If anyone is looking to grab some insulation, PM me and I can give you the number of this guy, he is located in Havelock."
