731166,jeffw,2012-09-19 19:34:00,267,was at sail today and say the rapala andros reels and was wondering if anyone could give me some feedback on them. Thanks Jeff
731168,BucktownAngler,2012-09-19 19:43:00,582,"not familiar with them.  a quick google search pulled up this Rapala Andros  i've purchased a Rapala reel before on sale at the sportsmen show. cheap quality, i returned it the next day."
731191,Rich,2012-09-19 20:59:00,3927,"My rapala baitcaster's sideplate never locked properly, and would click and unlock while fishing which completely turned off the brakes. Next cast, backlash. 7 outings, it lasted.  My gf's rapala spinning reel (xrap) seized up after being dropped at the riverbank in a centimetre of water.  I wouldn't recommend rapala reels. The rods have held up so far, but were terribly mismatched with the reels on their respective combos."
731198,BFSC Kevin,2012-09-19 21:35:00,1351,I have four rapala hydros reels. I'd highly recommend them. I am actyally considering to replace two of my shimano tekotas 600lc with them in fact...
731220,Joeytier,2012-09-19 22:12:00,3990,"The shop I used to work at had to send back far more Rapala Andros reels than any other popular line-counter, including cheaper models from Okuma and the like.  Never personally used them for that reason."
731377,bare foot wader,2012-09-20 15:47:00,1354,"I was initiall a fan of rapala rods, I thought they were pretty good value and decent rods, which they are..but they are incredibly cheaply built  I purchased 4 of them, the northcoast series and the f2 ultra light rod....one rod snapped brand new, another snapped after 2 months of light use (lost a monster coho), another snapped casting a 3oz weight and it's rated for 2-8oz i think, tip guide rotates around the blank and EVERY single rod has had issues with the reel seat, two completely spin around the blank...when i tighten the reel seat it actually pushed the foregrip cork forward  I cut my losses and stopped trying to return them, they all had issues  I wouldn't expect much for their reels  they should stick to making lures"
731391,ckrb2007,2012-09-20 16:48:00,449,i have a good friend who works for Rapala in Oshawa. He said the reels still have a ways to go but the rods are very good. He strictly uses r-type rods and loves them. I've used the TS2 rods and I really like them. The Shift and Concept rods look sick as well!
