730833,solopaddler,2012-09-18 18:32:00,8605,  The perfect rig!
730837,jimmer,2012-09-18 18:42:00,2730,"That boat would make it, but personally I would never attempt it and I have been operating boats for over 40 years. It's so tight in spots, with unseen rocks and boulders. Then you hear the stories of guys dying over the years. There is a way there without going through the rapids as Mike mentioned, but it's a little longer route from the south. Many guys have said that it's a worth while trip."
730908,SirCranksalot,2012-09-18 21:56:00,3291,"I've never been down the Bad River channel but I have canoed in that area quite a bit. With the small boat charts an a GPS navigation is no big problem. You could either go from Key River or from Byng/Britt. It's a bit longer from Byng but not by much.(and you get to see some spectacular scenery along the way, whereas going out the Key you're just travelling along a geological fault line with the possibility of strong West winds being funneled off the bay)"
731100,fishermccann,2012-09-19 15:13:00,655,I thought that the max. was 10 klh within 30yards or 100 feet from shore-everywhere?
731115,Roy,2012-09-19 16:25:00,13728, I've been in situations in very fast water where I've had to gun it (tiller) just to maintain control of the boat.
730555,jimmer,2012-09-17 19:03:00,2730,Can anyone tell me where this picture was taken?
730558,ecmilley,2012-09-17 19:07:00,2163,in a boat?
730559,davey buoy,2012-09-17 19:12:00,5505,Going a little fast in a smaller river/canal.
730561,jedimaster,2012-09-17 19:14:00,3472,No but I can tell you that the picture was taken about 6 years ago unless you don't know how to set the date on your Pentax Optio E10
730562,davey buoy,2012-09-17 19:17:00,5505,"Remember the days ,all you could get was a 25hp tiller?,god bless the 115hp tiller. That must be something to control by hand.WOW."
730566,jimmer,2012-09-17 19:21:00,2730,You guys sound like you're bored also.
730568,lew,2012-09-17 19:35:00,12766,The islands at the east end of Lovesick ??
730579,jedimaster,2012-09-17 20:02:00,3472,palmer rapids
730586,jimmer,2012-09-17 20:19:00,2730,No.
730588,Christopheraaron,2012-09-17 20:24:00,3525,Swimming pool?
730590,jimmer,2012-09-17 20:27:00,2730,Swimming pool of death maybe.
730592,solopaddler,2012-09-17 20:30:00,8605,Hey Jim is it the Bad River?  If not the Bad then somewhere further upstream on the French above hwy 69.
730593,misfish,2012-09-17 20:35:00,29133," I have only been there twice,but it does look like it."
730601,musky_hunter,2012-09-17 21:02:00,328,ottawa river?
730606,woodenboater,2012-09-17 21:52:00,2277,too much water for Palmers
730611,Rizzo,2012-09-17 22:27:00,4754,the ganges?
730622,ehg,2012-09-17 22:59:00,2666,Could be a zillion different places.  There was a channel between Bald Lakes and Pigeon that looked similar. Always peed me off when people buzzed through as it was decent fishing spot.
730736,jimmer,2012-09-18 13:19:00,2730,Close enough Mike. It is on the French River system heading down to the French River Delta. Is there anywhere you haven't been?
730740,solopaddler,2012-09-18 13:31:00,8605," No.  I've launched at Hartley Bay and occasionaly Danny's Marina on the Pickeral many times over the years.  Always make the run down the western channel of the French to Georgian Bay and what they call the Bad River.  Fantastic area, one of my favourites.  Your pic's looked mightily familiar.  So the question begs, if that's where you went how'd you make out?"
730752,jimmer,2012-09-18 14:34:00,2730,"I went two years in a row and stayed at Leon's place right at the mouth. The first year was good. We caught a few nice sized walleye, some nice pike and a few muskie. The next year wasn't so good. We struggled to get any walleye and most of the pike were small. An amazingly beautiful place, but we decided to try a new location for the next spring trip. Here are a few pics from those trips."
730774,solopaddler,2012-09-18 15:25:00,8605,"Very cool, I know that water quite well. I never found spring to be all that good. July has always been killer there, and again in October."
730775,Raf,2012-09-18 15:32:00,3495,on my to-do list.. need someone to get me down there safely.  i guess out the key and up is the safer bet.
730788,solopaddler,2012-09-18 16:01:00,8605,"  I'd be happy to tag along and show you around.  Seriously though it's difficult but not that difficult to navigate down there. Especially so if you had explicit directions and instructions along with a detailed map.  While I've seen it done, personally I would never navigate down through those rapids with a console. A tiller is an absolute must to make the sharp precise turns necessary in the current."
730810,jimmer,2012-09-18 16:51:00,2730,You could probably pay Leon to take you down there. The quality of the route can change throughout the year though.
730826,Raf,2012-09-18 17:40:00,3495, I've a 15' with a 40hp - tiller.
