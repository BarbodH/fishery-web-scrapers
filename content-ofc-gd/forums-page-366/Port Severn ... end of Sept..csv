731052,Lunker777,2012-09-19 12:52:00,866,Hey everyone  I have an opportunity to head up to Port Severn the last weekend of September. I'm debating weather to make the trip or not. Anyone willing to talk me into it ?? lol !!!! whats the fishing like in the area at that time ?  I can't help but notice that its about an hour from Simcoe. Would the big fall smallies and perch be hitting hard at that time on Simcoe ?  PLEASE..... talk me into this trip . haha
731056,BillM,2012-09-19 13:11:00,17367,"Seems a bit early for Simcoe for giant smallies, but it all depends on the weather I guess."
731066,steel&chrome,2012-09-19 13:47:00,46,"totally agree, weather is huge, especially the way its been this year! Great structure and such.  best of luck,  S&C"

731426,davey buoy,2012-09-20 20:39:00,5505,"You will have to do your homework on Simcoe, rock drop offs deeper water,if you don't know the lake,can be a bit of a challenge."
731435,Christopheraaron,2012-09-20 22:19:00,3525,"Just go!!! Forget simcoe, unless you want a gobie fry."
731436,davey buoy,2012-09-20 22:21:00,5505," I guess you've fished Kempenfelt?,not Simcoe.The Ontario record is yet to come!!"
731438,bobowski,2012-09-20 22:26:00,360,I fish Port Severn waters quite regularly. The Musky bite is starting to pick up right now if you can find them. There is also great pike fishing to be had. The Walleye are tough to find but there are plenty of Bass. If you do go just be very careful out there as the water level is the lowest that I have ever seen it. Lots of rocks that I have never seen before.
731442,davey buoy,2012-09-20 22:32:00,5505, This year again I damaged a prop going out between the markers from the river to Nottawasaga bay in Wasaga.The G bay waters are even lower than last year. Be really carefull!!I don't know how bigger boats than mine do it with the wave swells.
