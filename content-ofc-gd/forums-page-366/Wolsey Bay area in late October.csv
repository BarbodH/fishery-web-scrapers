730741,cisco,2012-09-18 13:32:00,597,The river is too warm so drive to the mouth and fish around Blueberry Island for walleye and pike. Been there done that years ago. Stealth mode. Drag/drift minnow/worm rigs off bottom  and troll spinners/body baits.
731295,F_ast,2012-09-20 02:43:00,154,Most of the lodges close their doors after the second week in october.  I fish the first week of Oct almost every year and it is not uncommon to see -5 over night temps.  Fishing can be good.  But can be terible too.
