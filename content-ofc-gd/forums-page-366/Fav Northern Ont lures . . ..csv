731177,bigbuck,2012-09-19 20:25:00,2449,"For northern lakes, you can't beat a chartreuse/orange jighead. Unfortunately, down in Southern Ontario, you can't find them. Most bait shops in the north sell them, they tend to be local made. A worm or a minnnow and you are good to go. A couple of Rapala's, Husky Jerks and Tail Dancers and a spoon or two and you are golden. Good luck and slay the buggers."
731326,Acountdeleted,2012-09-20 12:33:00,2562,All I ever use in Northern Ontario is a chartruse jig with a minnow. I've never had any 'Monsters' But my arm tends to get sore from all the pike and walleye I bring in. The locals up north always insist 'Use a minnow on everything!'
730436,siwash,2012-09-17 10:54:00,683,"Hey folks:  Heading up on Thursday to the Gowganda area (Lost Lake Wilderness Lodge). Seems like it's going to rain a fair bit.. Temps have cooled too... Fall is here!  What would be your go-to baits/lures given these temps/conditions up there? We will target SM bass, walleye and pike. I am thinking tube jigs, regular jigs, and Rapalas (diving or surface) in various colours..  Probably try some spinners too...  Thoughts? Any particular success in those lakes with a favourite lure?   Thanks!"
730440,gordy28,2012-09-17 11:28:00,638,Your list is solid Adds from our recent trip north: Worm harnesses (we liked the Northland ones) on bottom bouncers for walleye Wacky rigged senkos for bass Spinnerbaits for both sm and pike
730453,Rod Caster,2012-09-17 12:30:00,5784,"Rapala clackin rap for those structure-holding walleye. Regular jig n grub combo for general use Large shank, heavy jig head with 4-5"" paddle tail swammer for pike (and walleye n bass)"
730523,kickingfrog,2012-09-17 16:14:00,8333,I really like Glidin' Raps and saltwater x-raps for walleye and pike. The glidin' rap is nice because for a good sized bait it doesn't pull too hard.
730577,siwash,2012-09-17 19:56:00,683,"thanks for the input, fellas... might try minnows too  "
730581,siwash,2012-09-17 20:03:00,683,Forgot to ask - are wire leaders necessary due to the pike? I hate using them... and if we jig you cant anyway.. Anyway around pike teeth up there?
730585,Roy,2012-09-17 20:10:00,13728,It's too bad you're going up so early. A few weeks later and you would not need steel leaders. Pike lose their teeth in late fall.
730587,capt bruce,2012-09-17 20:21:00,820,"  Ya got that wrong Roy its not Northern Pike that lose their teeth in the fall , Its northern women from Kapuskasing , lots of people make the same mistake but take it from someone who knows ,not Pike its the Kapuskasing babes .If you see a Kapuskasing women with more than 4 teeth in the fall ,shes not a real northerer  shes an infiltrator from the south .."
730595,Stoty,2012-09-17 20:41:00,2910,Xzone Slammers & Swammers are a MUST have for bass!
730608,northernpike56,2012-09-17 22:02:00,717,"5 1/2"" husky jerk firetiger  whacky rigged senkos for bass"
730609,davey buoy,2012-09-17 22:09:00,5505,"I second the spinner bait, How about a 1/2oz white terminator. Great for bass and pike.The little extra weight can get you down lower if you need to."
730616,davey buoy,2012-09-17 22:38:00,5505, Your exactly right! Over two years live bait free!.
730621,Joeytier,2012-09-17 22:58:00,3990,  Just tie on a williams with a snelled cigarette butt.
730631,Grimace,2012-09-17 23:27:00,2020,A lindy rig with a minnow can be absolutely deadly when nothing else works.   You can cover a bit of water with it as well.
730650,TennesseeGuy,2012-09-18 00:13:00,957,  A few will be losing teeth attempting to eat my Suick.
730662,brkygetr,2012-09-18 00:40:00,425,"Jig and a minnow, drifting. Glow in the dark or white with 'red eye'. 1/2 ounce...keep the rod tip moving. Deadly if you have the patience."
730663,Joeytier,2012-09-18 00:41:00,3990,"hah!  No thanks.  Gulp minnows work fine with an active presentation on a jig head, but free rigging on bottom?  Wouldn't even think about it. Give me a big lively dace and hold on"
730675,siwash,2012-09-18 01:10:00,683,"Thanks for all the tips, guys... the only lure I rarely use on the list is spinnerbait.. Never caught much on them.. maybe needs more of a chance! I did once catch a walleye, of all things, on a spinner on Pigeon Lake.  I think the smallies like the smaller spinners, no?  Thanks again..  Hope to post good results!!"
730707,limeyangler,2012-09-18 03:35:00,5204, is all you need
730712,Grimace,2012-09-18 04:30:00,2020, Agreed!
730769,Brettiop,2012-09-18 15:10:00,279, Spinner baits for sure need some more time.....Great pike/bass bait all the time!  white/chartruese

730961,camillj,2012-09-19 00:33:00,1988,"There's a reason they still sell Williams Wobblers after like 70 years  I personally like the gold/silver dimpled wobbler (4 - 6"") depending on species ... caught lakers, bass, pike, musky (never pickeral though) ... definitely a go-to lure for trolling (either on downrigger or with a couple ounces of weight a few feet aead of the lure)"
731013,Joeytier,2012-09-19 04:14:00,3990,Wobblers definitely catch pickeral!
