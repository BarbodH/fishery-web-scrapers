All in all was a great time. By far my most productive outing in terms of size. The smallies are all mixed up tho. Some out of 28 FOW and some from 10-13. In total I caught only 4 fish, but they were from 17-19.5 inches in length. Fish was a great fight, couple of amazing jumps, and pulled the drag like no other fish this year.  Solo fish, so not the best pics. For size reference, my net is 19.5 inches at its widest point.  First fish of the night   Couple of friends, they followed me almost 1 KM down the shore line,   My new PB in the net   Another pic of my PB   Hope u enjoy  On a side note, I trolled around for the last hour or so, looking for a Salmon to hit my spoon. Kinda new at this, any tips would be awesome."
