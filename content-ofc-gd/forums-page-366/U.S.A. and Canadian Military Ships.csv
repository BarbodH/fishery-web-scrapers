729357,Billy Bob,2012-09-12 16:47:00,5865,For those interested in touring these military ships they are now docked in Buffalo.......  http://www.buffalonews.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20120912/CITYANDREGION/120919758/1010
729392,rhymobot,2012-09-12 19:15:00,174,I like the Erie Naval Park down there in Buffalo. Went last year on the 2 ships and submarine and it was a real eye opener as to how sailors lived in those close quarters.
729406,mercman,2012-09-12 20:48:00,7054,"VERY COOL:clapping:  Like the way the Canadian ship is called a Frigate, and the americain is a DESTROYER!!!"
729408,lew,2012-09-12 21:13:00,12766," Just different types of ships, that's all."
729430,kickingfrog,2012-09-12 22:57:00,8333,Meh. That's a lot of money for something that doesn't troll for snot.  The real treat would being onboard while they were on maneuversâ€¦.  provided I could keep my cookies down.
729435,ketchenany,2012-09-12 23:09:00,3229," Paul, what is yours? catch and release"
729472,mercman,2012-09-13 01:13:00,7054,  Ohhhh....Frigate then
729473,mercman,2012-09-13 01:21:00,7054,"I saw the Frigate shown in the pics, cruiseing up the seaway, while fishing in St Louis a couple of weeks ago. I saluted her, and the crew on deck waved and saluted back. About an hour later, an Americain Destroyer criused up into the shipping lanes. The guy i was with decided he wanted a closer look, and did a hard 90 at full speed towards the big ship. I told him he was an idiot  and i am sure every gun on board was aimed and ready to blast us out of the water.I was ready to throw him overboard i was so pissed."
729521,Billy Bob,2012-09-13 10:23:00,5865,You're right Paul.....they don't mess around any more when a boat approaches them at a high rate of speed. Those 50 caliber guns can make a quick exit for those doing what you just did.....
729542,oldphart,2012-09-13 12:53:00,665,"~~~~Was watching a TV show last night called Combat Cash, 1 segment was about the re-enactment of D Day landing at a park in Ohio on I believe Lake Erie, with landing craft and a Duck and guys running up the beach dressed as G.I.s being fired on by other dressed as Germen solders, would have been great I sure to have these warships off shore firing their guns also. Going to see if I can get some more info on this, wouldn't mind going down to see it."
729573,Mike Pike,2012-09-13 16:04:00,1332,"Wow, that looks like a pretty good time down on your waterfront there Billy Bob!"
729582,UglyBug,2012-09-13 16:41:00,148,"I was in that boat when the guy did the hard 90 towards it. I spent years in the security field and have dealt with the US Navy doing contract, work they really do shoot first then say  . The guy was a total DORK and should be grounded for doing stupid stuff like that.  Totally not smart at all:wallbash:"
729713,bucktail,2012-09-14 02:39:00,1857,"Great post Billy thaks.........btw, you guys down there know we won that war eh??? LOL"
729833,craigdritchie,2012-09-14 20:28:00,1586,"Been there, done that. A few years ago I spent some time on the Pacific Ocean aboard HMCS Regina as a guest of the Canadian Navy. Regina is a Halifax-class frigate, basically identical to the one visiting Buffalo. The ship's company were awesome - they even let me drive it!  Danger on the high seas - me at the controls of a 440-foot, 115,000 hp warship (and under the watchful eye of the entire bridge crew)   With one of the 50 caliber machine guns   Being buzzed by a couple of our own .... CF-18s from Comox. On the closest plane you can see one wingtip missle is gone, while the other remains. Something got blowed up real good.   It doesn't troll very well, but the fishfinder is unbelievable. Keeping one's cookies down is another matter."
729954,Billy Bob,2012-09-15 12:20:00,5865,For those still interested in maybe going this weekend here's a update of events.......  http://www.buffalonews.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20120914/CITYANDREGION/120919344/1010
729955,Billy Bob,2012-09-15 12:21:00,5865," Yes, but now we want to have a redo.........."
729967,TJQ,2012-09-15 13:23:00,7806, LOL... I was on one in Halifax.. quite the piece of equipment!
729978,lew,2012-09-15 14:05:00,12766,These were the  ships I sailed in back in the 60's.  1st one is HMCS Provider & 2nd is HMCS ANNAPOLIS  Alot has changed in the nearly 50 years since I signed up.    
729981,kickingfrog,2012-09-15 14:16:00,8333, With the passing on Neil Armstrong there was some renewed talk about the moon landings from the 60's. One of the astronauts made a comment along the lines of: today's cellphones having more computing power then the entire rocket and lunar lander used on his mission.
730039,Billy Bob,2012-09-15 22:51:00,5865, And you still haven't hit one....................
731332,craigdritchie,2012-09-20 12:58:00,1586,Quick update - both ships are in Hamilton today (Thurs. Sept 20) and Friday (Sept 21) .... open for tours.
