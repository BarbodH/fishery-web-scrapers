730857,mirogak,2012-09-18 19:52:00,387,"Was in the park this past weekend for a couple of days.  Rained 2 of the 3 days, fish weren't interested in bites (except for SMB) but didn't do much serious fishing in all honesty.  Had fun though and that's what Algonquin is all about.  Managed to grab a couple of snaps on the Oxtongue on the last day. Miro   "
730860,Christopheraaron,2012-09-18 19:57:00,3525,"Cool, have you ever caught anything in the river?"
730862,davey buoy,2012-09-18 19:58:00,5505,"Looks like nice water Miro!,to bad the weather didn't co-operate."
730866,mirogak,2012-09-18 20:05:00,387, Not really - unless you count chubs and small bass.
730877,solopaddler,2012-09-18 20:28:00,8605,Shades of A River Runs Through It.  Very nice Miro!
730899,Joey,2012-09-18 21:18:00,9122,Great pics!!!
730911,esoxansteel,2012-09-18 22:02:00,1307,"Action shots of Flyfishing make great photo's, especially with the tempting lookin river in front of you.  "
730914,misfish,2012-09-18 22:06:00,29133,"Great shots. I even tried to find what fly you were using,as the tippet was very clear in the pic,s,but could,nt see the choice of bait."
730965,SirCranksalot,2012-09-19 00:43:00,3291,"  Did you catch the bass downstream of the falls? I understood that there were specks above the falls, but if the bass have gotten in there----well, there goes the neighbourhood!"
731011,mirogak,2012-09-19 04:05:00,387," No the bass were near the Tea Lake Damn ... there is a big hole under the bridge there.  This stretch of the river was south of West Gate and I did see some fish activity in the water, just not on my hook"
731129,SirCranksalot,2012-09-19 17:36:00,3291,"The bridge is below the dam, right? So does that mean there are bass in the whole stretch from Dwight up to the dam?"
731145,mirogak,2012-09-19 18:25:00,387, Yes that is correct and also a safe assumption about the bass being present from Dwight to the Dam.
731210,Musky or Specks,2012-09-19 21:59:00,2710,Bass are present from Smoke Cr all the way down to LOB Its just not great bass habitat
731215,SirCranksalot,2012-09-19 22:05:00,3291, Do you know if there are any speks in the section between T lake and the falls?
731219,Musky or Specks,2012-09-19 22:11:00,2710,Its not good speck habitat either I hear the odd one gets caught.
731263,SirCranksalot,2012-09-20 01:15:00,3291,Thx. I guess I'll cross that 1 off my bucket list. It'll leave more room in my bucket for something else!
731267,ProFishermanJones,2012-09-20 01:22:00,77,great pictures! can't wait to get back up to that area
731299,ckrb2007,2012-09-20 03:04:00,449,"My sister has a ""cottage"" on Oxtongue lake. I went there early ice fishing season last year and needless to say, I've never walked so much, and drilled so many holes without seeing any fish at all in my life. lol I haven't been back since.  Great pics though!"
731300,mirogak,2012-09-20 03:25:00,387,"Agree - there ain't no brookies in the Oxtongue river.  You gotta put in the work for Brookies, deeper in the park. Beautiful river though for picnicking."
