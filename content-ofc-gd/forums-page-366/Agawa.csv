The main reason for the trip was to take the Agawa Canyon rail tour. In my opinion, money well spent.     I could have easily hopped off the train and just disappeared into the beautiful countryside. Water levels everywhere were critically low, sot the falls did not have much show. Even so,....   I did fish during the road trip, but I was so taken up with the beauty of my surroundings that i never thought to take pics of any of the fish caught."
