730785,MrSimon,2012-09-18 15:52:00,217,"Hi guys, me and my group of buddies take an annual fishing trip north .... just like most of you.  We like to bounce around from place to place fishing new water, but for next year we have a very specific set of criteria.  I was hoping some of you might have a recommendation for us.  1.  We want to stay at a private outpost cabin.  No fly-ins.  Boat or drive-in only.  Solitude is a must. 2.  We are looking for something that is a MAX of 5 hours from the Thousand Islands bridge. 3.  We love love love to fish shallow water for pike (or bass/walleye too).  We love to cast lures and are pretty bad at jig fishing.  So we are looking for a lake that has lots of weedy bays and other good pike habitat. 4.  We also really like the adventure of portaging/hiking into bush lakes.  Any ideas?  We would most likely go in late summer."

730816,MrSimon,2012-09-18 17:01:00,217,"Thanks!  Do you mean Crotch Lake that is just west of Clarendon Station?  If so, we fished it a few years ago.  It certainly is a gorgeous lake, but there are no outpost cabins and very limited pike habitat.  The smallmouth fishing was incredible though. "
730822,chris.brock,2012-09-18 17:21:00,4053,"do a search for outfitters in La VÃ©rendrye park in Quebec, it fits your criteria for driving distance, and remoteness"
730888,adempsey,2012-09-18 20:50:00,1498,"Best bet is somewhere in Quebec as mentioned.  Otherwise, you're going to have to give something up from your criteria."
730902,Christopheraaron,2012-09-18 21:29:00,3525,"If you don't mind trout and bass check out kenuk montebello, a little pricey but the fishing is great, cabins are nice and very secluded (as long as you get off of papineau, which is still nice, just a little more traffic)."
