730258,Joey,2012-09-16 21:00:00,9122,"Went out on the big lake for some salmon today.  What a beautiful day it was out there.  Water was like glass most of the morning.  I think it was a bit too early for darling Ralphie tho      Right off the get go, on the way out to deeper water, as we trolled out, we got a hit.  Believe it is a coho salmon.  Just a beauty right near the surface!!!      Then we waited patiently for more hits!           Lots of these guys flying south, monarch butterflies    Couldn't get a good pic tho with the boat moving and them fluttering by!     Ralphie got tired of waiting       Not sure if this is allowed as Ralphie doesn't have his boater operators card      We stuck it out until about 1 p.m. and didn't get another hit.  We did see the fish come up after the lure on the fishfinder, then go back down again, dang that's frustrating!  But it was such a nice day it didn't matter, was just nice to be out there!!!  Cheers,  Joey"
730264,Christopheraaron,2012-09-16 21:11:00,3525,"Still looks like a fun morning, Ralphie is adorable!"
730267,lew,2012-09-16 21:28:00,12766,I think Ralphies upset Paul didn't let him crank in that 1st fish Joey
730268,Joey,2012-09-16 21:35:00,9122," Actually, it was a comedy of errors Lew, it was supposed to be my fish, so Paul grabbed the rod for me, but it was already on the surface, and we actually thought he grabbed the wrong rod, so I grabbed the other, then we thought we were tangled.  It ended up being on the rod in his hands and we both reeled in, and it was pretty much at the boat already, so I netted it.  Ralphie gets the next one"
730279,BillM,2012-09-16 22:05:00,17367,That first fish is a steelhead!  Good job!
730332,Joey,2012-09-16 23:34:00,9122,A steelhead with a white mouth and hook jaw?  I guess it's been awhile since I caught a steelhead     I always thought they had a black mouth and smaller jaw.  It's the same fish in both pics BTW!
730335,Christopheraaron,2012-09-16 23:43:00,3525," Definitely a steely, yes they have light mouths."
730336,BillM,2012-09-16 23:45:00,17367," Yup, tail is a dead giveaway as well..  The males can have quite the hook come spawning time!"
730339,Joey,2012-09-16 23:51:00,9122,"Thanks guys, guess the hook jaw is what perplexed us.  I've only ever caught them mostly earlier in the season and they had much smaller mouths than this one with no hook.  Yes, looking at the tail would indicate Steelhead, expecially with the spots on the whole tail."
730346,Twocoda,2012-09-17 00:10:00,4130,small mouths will be hens..males mouths kype...salmon have fork tails...steelie Square..beauty fish though...nice shootin
730351,Terry,2012-09-17 00:18:00,14456,nice going guys
730410,SlowPoke,2012-09-17 03:17:00,2984,"Chinook - black gums, black mouth Coho - black gums, white mouth Rainbow - white gums, white mouth This will identify 95% of the Lake O fish. Sometimes the gums and mouth can be a little spotty or gray. Look at the tail. Fork is salmon, square is trout.   Looks like a nice day.... a lot nice than St. Clair today!!!!"
730433,Roy,2012-09-17 10:28:00,13728,Really great pics Joey and a super day out on the lake for you guys. So did you have trout for supper last night?  I guess you guys will be hitting LSC sometime soon? Or maybe the West Arm one more time this season? How about the Larry?
730456,Rod Caster,2012-09-17 12:34:00,5784,"That looks like a great little trip for the family. That 'bow looks like a healthy, good eating specimen."
730457,Spiel,2012-09-17 12:36:00,9065,"Nice, was a good day to be out there."
730471,Joey,2012-09-17 13:17:00,9122," Actually, we'd like to do all three my dear"
730531,fishnsled,2012-09-17 16:35:00,3520,"Looks like a nice day on the water for the 3 of you. Great pics! Too bad about the lack of fish but certainly better than sitting at home. I was out there as well with a buddy and had a great day, report to come."
730635,spincast,2012-09-17 23:37:00,3279,nice fish - love the colours.  Definitely a different looking wave patter than what we saw on St Clair Slowpoke
731018,motv8tr,2012-09-19 05:06:00,2587,Looks like it was a great day all around...that fish is real pretty too  Maureen
