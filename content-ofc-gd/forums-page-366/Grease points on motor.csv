My question...for the grease ports that require a grease gun...how do you know how much to put in?  Does it squirt out when full?  Thanks in advance."
730870,jedimaster,2012-09-18 20:15:00,3472,"It depends on the type, if it is a sealed type then just enough to make the boot firm. if its not sealed, then I put enough in to push out the old dirty greese then wipe off the excess with a rag."
731095,bigbuck,2012-09-19 15:03:00,2449,"If in doubt, just do 2-3 pumps to get some new grease in."
731178,jedimaster,2012-09-19 20:25:00,3472,"yah, if you don't know for sure, you don't want to wreck the seal by putting too much in. those grease guns have a surprising amount of psi."
