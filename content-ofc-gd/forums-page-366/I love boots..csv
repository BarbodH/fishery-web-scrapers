730797,Jigger,2012-09-18 16:22:00,1237,Mmm did someone say Boot Boil?
730799,Christopheraaron,2012-09-18 16:29:00,3525," Ya, and a few bows and browns wouldn't be bad either!"
730812,Aaron Shirley,2012-09-18 16:55:00,655,That Is a great fish to catch on light gear. Well done.
730839,strakey,2012-09-18 18:44:00,78,Totally understand why boots are so well loved. Caught one myself sat morn running 30 lbs and uglier than Bill's. Fresh fish. If it was open water I would of been spooled for sure. Completely under gunned even with salmon gear. Sent him back to tire himself out the preferred way.
730843,BillM,2012-09-18 18:53:00,17367,They definitely wouldn't win any beauty contests!
730844,Twocoda,2012-09-18 19:03:00,4130,But they do win the hearts of MANY...I took a buddy down there last year and although he has caught 100s of fish all year long he hasnt stopped talking about that adventure...its going to probably be an annual pilgrimage going forward....
730863,misfish,2012-09-18 19:59:00,29133,That looks like a skein machine Bill.
730864,funfishing,2012-09-18 20:00:00,147, There's no way you're not being sarcastic. Cohos are like steelhead with mad cow disease.  Here's a pic of a coho in case you need to be reminded of which fish they are. Perhaps you had them mistaken for another species:  
730882,Snidley,2012-09-18 20:43:00,620,"I've caught hundreds of Coho's and they don't look like that. I can tell from the tongue. I am serious about Coho's, all they do is roll and give up until near the boat then they thrash. It is NOT a fight. They do fight well once they change colour about November but by that time they are stream fish for the long rod crowd."
730885,kemper,2012-09-18 20:49:00,2232," I've been having an absolute BLAST with cohos the past couple weeks. This time of year, nothing beats them!  For the most part our rivers aren't wide/deep enough to give chinooks the space they need to show their power, but the smaller cohos sure put on a show. They are also more than willing to take a swung fly...which is awesome."
730927,Jigger,2012-09-18 22:58:00,1237,"For what its worth, big Brown>any Salmon IMO"
730941,ccmtcanada,2012-09-18 23:32:00,7971,Ohhhhhhh....booTs...for some reason I saw a different word.  Nevermind.
730978,BillM,2012-09-19 01:22:00,17367," The exact opposite, lol!"
730994,Dave Jones,2012-09-19 02:27:00,50,Nice! You gotta get down this way some time in Nov.
731058,BillM,2012-09-19 13:14:00,17367, Let me know man!  We'll make some plans.
731061,torco,2012-09-19 13:28:00,656,"  Nice fish Bill, one of my favorite ways to fish right there.  Kemper like the idea of getting a coho on a swung fly. I just finally learned spey casting on the weekend that would be an excellent use of my new skills"
731089,Snidley,2012-09-19 14:54:00,620,Actually have to eat a little crow this morning as I got a big Coho this AM and it fought really well with several jumps of 6 feet in the air. I thought it must be one of those elusive Atlantics that CRAA claims are out there because it fought so well. She still ended the fight wrapped up like a mummy and needed to be cut out of my line but it was probably the best fish I have caught this year. So now 1 Coho in hundreds that fought well. Not sure that's really any sort of positive endorsement but there you have it.
730636,BillM,2012-09-17 23:41:00,17367,"Especially when they are like this!    Had almost spooled me twice, had to chase it with the boat."
730638,solopaddler,2012-09-17 23:43:00,8605,Good God what a hideous fish. You've been slumming I see.
730640,Joey,2012-09-17 23:49:00,9122,"Yup, ugly as sin, the fish I mean"
730641,BillM,2012-09-17 23:50:00,17367," I would have loved to tussle with this thing about 3 months ago in the lake!  That being said, he definitely didn't lay over and die, put up a great fight."
730642,mercman,2012-09-17 23:53:00,7054,Definately not what i expected to find in here
730645,mercman,2012-09-17 23:59:00,7054,  Thats cause i wear pumps !!!!
730648,mike rousseau,2012-09-18 00:09:00,4661,Too busy for boots this year...  Some nice slummin there...lol
730649,kemper,2012-09-18 00:11:00,2232,"Got a bad case of booteritis eh Bill?  I caught a few cases myself this weekend, worth it to sort through to the cohos though!"
730651,mercman,2012-09-18 00:22:00,7054,    Why do they call it a BOOT?...looks like a salmon
730665,Joeytier,2012-09-18 00:44:00,3990,"It's a term that elitist steelheaders created to separate themselves from the hordes of snag-happy idiots that come out when the salmon run starts, even though a big staging chinook will likely fight better pound-for-pound than most other fish on the face earth."
730676,Twocoda,2012-09-18 01:11:00,4130,We call them Scabbys...as in scabby ole salmon....Boots is reserved for lakers....Im making the trip down this weekend for some of those boys and hen....They are a great fight!!!!Nice shootin Bill Definatly worth sorting through for the hoes
730677,siwash,2012-09-18 01:13:00,683,"   Agreed... In B.C. staging and river-run chinooks have all the respect in the world..  We are lucky to have them here in Ontario  Nice catch, by the way.. upper 20s?"
730679,BillM,2012-09-18 01:17:00,17367," Wait, who's complaining about boots again?   I love fishing for them in the estuary water when they are staging, puts a steelhead to shame with the way they fight.  Now if you're ganking them in the back while they are in 3ft of water, that's a different story.   Great way to spend a fall evening if you ask me."
730684,Joeytier,2012-09-18 01:31:00,3990,Agreed!  I was speaking more about the breed of steelheaders that will gawk at you for simply targetting a salmon or wearing less than $1500 worth of gear.  I wish I was being hyperbolic.
730690,Pigeontroller,2012-09-18 01:51:00,2793,Casting from the boat in the dark eh? Been meaning to do that...
730702,fishnsled,2012-09-18 02:50:00,3520, Have only done that once and it was a great way to spend a fall evening. Nice to have the elbow room in the boat and catching some big fish. Nice fish Bill.
730713,Cudz,2012-09-18 04:44:00,2652,"Although bootish, it is a big fish.  I wouldn't mind the battle.  Ugly but big (the fish)  Bill you look great."
730728,Harrison,2012-09-18 12:10:00,2202,"Nothing like open water ""boots"" on lighter gear.  NOTHING smashes a spoon or jerk bait on the cast harder IMO.  Nice fish Bill."
730730,wallacio,2012-09-18 12:16:00,475,That was good fun bud.   I was happy to be chase boat pilot/net man/photographer for that one!
730750,Snidley,2012-09-18 14:29:00,620,The comparison of casting for and catching staging salmon (particularly early staging salmon) on bass gear vs trolling up silvery Chinnooks on trolling gear out in the lake is night and day. One is so boring that anglers have to be enticed with cash to do it and the other offers such an exciting fishing outing that guys stay up all night to do it. No comparison IMO.
730755,craigdritchie,2012-09-18 14:42:00,1586,"Nice mudshark!  Today's rain will obviously push the dark chinnies upstream to spawn / get snagged. But it will also bring more, fresher fish into the river mouth. Like broonies and cohos and rainbows - oh my!  :-)"
730756,BillM,2012-09-18 14:44:00,17367, I wouldn't mind a run-in with a few fresh coho's!
730762,Harrison,2012-09-18 14:58:00,2202," Very true Craig, too bad everything stops running in November, remember."
730771,Snidley,2012-09-18 15:12:00,620,I would take a staging Chinnook over a Coho any time. Coho's are among the worst fighting fish out there and their only true asset is their appearance. Steelhead on the other hand are much anticipated by this angler.
730778,craigdritchie,2012-09-18 15:36:00,1586,"I think we'll have to agree to disagree on the cohos, Snidley. They obviously don't have the body mass of a chinook going for them, but I love the way cohos jump. The way they just massacre crankbaits (Shad Raps in particular) is also a big plus in my books. I've always felt they were a ton of fun out in the lake on a bass rod - right up till November, when everything stops running  :-)"
