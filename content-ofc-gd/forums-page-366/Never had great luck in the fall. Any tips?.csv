The last couple of Falls I've hit Buckhorn, Skugog and Stoney but have had 2 boat skunked each time.  Obviously no fishing is guaranteed but really hoping to keep my buddy happy.  For Oct 1st should we spend 2 hours driving to Buckhorn or stay closer with Rice etc?   I remember last year that Buckhorn looked awesome but I think we had one follower the whole day.  Thx ahead."
731081,BillM,2012-09-19 14:35:00,17367,Might wanna tell us what you're fishing for.
731082,Rich,2012-09-19 14:38:00,3927,That time of the year the fishing should be great. Throw big baits with blades and cover lots of water. Nothing is too shallow at that time.
731083,Raycaster,2012-09-19 14:44:00,528," Sorry guy, looking for the standards - bass/pike etc."
731088,lew,2012-09-19 14:53:00,12766, You won't be getting any pike from Buckhorn.
731090,Christopheraaron,2012-09-19 14:57:00,3525," Or rice, as a general rule in the fall fish are fattening up for winter so covering weed and sand flats with big slow baits should produce."
731186,Rich,2012-09-19 20:52:00,3927,Spinnerbaits id say are like in the top 3 standard bass or pike baits.
