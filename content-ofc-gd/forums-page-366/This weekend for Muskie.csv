Gonna be in the 16 foot Lund, so big water is like out since its supposed to be stormy. A friend wants to go out for a romp on the water with the big fish. I would typically take a new guy to pigeon as I usually have good luck there fishing with new guys.  Just wondering if anyone might have some other ideas of where i could try. I don't mind driving a fair distance, say 2-3 hours of Gta, but it'll likely be a day trip. Looks like some storms on the way for Sat so I'll have to keep that in mind as well for the water conditions.  If you feel the need to keep any destinations secret I will of course return the favour and blackout any pics in the slime report."
