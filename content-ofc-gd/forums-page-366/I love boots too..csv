730859,capt bruce,2012-09-18 19:54:00,820,"  Mike say its not so , you flossed those boots with a marshmallow ... Lol nice boots , alot prettier than Bills ,"
730861,misfish,2012-09-18 19:58:00,29133,I like them Mike. Nothing like a hand made pair of mukluks.

730878,kemper,2012-09-18 20:29:00,2232,"Mike stop fleecing chinooks.  On second thought, at least you used the body after you squeezed the roe..."
