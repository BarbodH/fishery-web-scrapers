730993,rufus,2012-09-19 02:22:00,267,"On Friday morning I cast my large double 10 bucktail and it landed five feet from shore. As soon as I began my retrieve I saw the large back of a muskie break the water's surface a couple of feet from where my lure had landed. I was pretty sure she was chasing my large spinner and as the lure approached the boat I saw the muskie right behind it. She bit the lure as I started the first turn of my figure eight and the water exploded!  This beautiful muskie was found in a ""textbook"" summer location in some rocks and weeds adjacent to a nice weed bed feeding area with deep water nearby.  "

731014,rufus,2012-09-19 04:19:00,267,"Thanks! Yeah, it was like I was watching a TV show with the way he breached the surface at shore, followed, and bit at the boat. It was classic"

731067,rufus,2012-09-19 13:50:00,267,"Thanks everyone! Yes, her tail is quite distinctive - not the prettiest muskie I've caught but it was a rush and always nice when a plan comes together. She ended the life of my old reel though so hard to tell who really won the battle"
731072,bigbuck,2012-09-19 14:11:00,2449,Nice 'ski!!!!!

731102,rufus,2012-09-19 15:19:00,267,Thanks all! It was my 13 year old Abu 6500 C3. I have bought a Revo Winch and at some point will see if I can resurrect the C3 for pike.
731110,Roy,2012-09-19 16:01:00,13728, Good luck. There certainly is no shortage of parts for those reels.
