(At this point, I will settle for anything...been a bad year for catching decent size fish...at least for me).  I have a map chip, and will be hunting around for spots (all part of the fun).  Anyone willing to share their experiences with this area (tips - not honey holes....  ).  One thing I have heard is that the area can be treacherous for navigation.  Also not sure on Moon River itself - if I can navigate it safely, etc.  Anyway, hope to have a report that I can share on what I find."
