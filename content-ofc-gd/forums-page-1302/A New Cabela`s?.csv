12916,OhioFisherman,2006-12-16 14:27:00,6623,"The front page of the paper the other day, possibly a new Cabela`s in Wadsworth Ohio, junction of I-76 and State route 57. Possibly within 2 years, devils in the details! LOL Yes closer to home, Deg?"
12925,Ron,2006-12-16 15:09:00,1683,Rumor has it there will be one coming to the Toronto = Oshawa area too!
12927,SlowPoke,2006-12-16 15:20:00,2984,I don't know about the Toronto area but they're opening one in Montreal http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?...&highlight=
12928,Dondorfish,2006-12-16 15:23:00,1000,Oh man  - am I gonna be in trouble if that happens ( Toronto ) - My wifes complains now about how much I spend at Cabelas and Ebay. I hope your right!   Don
12935,Garyv,2006-12-16 15:56:00,547,"Here's their planned new store locations.  Opening Soon Adairsville, GA East Hartford, CT East Rutherford, NJ Gonzales, LA Hammond, IN Hazelwood, MO Hoffman Estates, IL Lacey, WA Montreal, QC Post Falls, ID Reno, NV Wheat Ridge, CO"
12940,Fisherman,2006-12-16 16:27:00,7201,I'm sure there would be enough interest to support a Cabelas around the Toronto area.
12948,fishindevil,2006-12-16 18:14:00,6254,"i wish,  i would love a cabelas to come to the GTA,that would be amazing and im sure there is enough of us fisherman & hunters to support a store that big around here..."
12961,Fisherman,2006-12-16 19:51:00,7201,Time to start lobbying Cabelas... we want a store rah rah rah.
13029,IanD,2006-12-17 00:22:00,16,If and when they open in Montreal (Mirabel to be exact) they will be 10 minutes from home.
13061,Fisherman,2006-12-17 01:58:00,7201,Sure...rub it in real hard
13081,Lungelarry,2006-12-17 03:13:00,294,If we get  the Mirabel store it will be 5 minutes from where I work.....I'll have to ask for a raise
13385,Bob Devine,2006-12-18 00:28:00,251,Living in Windsor I am fortunate enough that Bass Pro is 35 minutes and Cabela's is 55 minutes. The only problem is they are in 2 different directions.  The tough choices I have to make !!
13397,Handlebarz,2006-12-18 00:53:00,3790,Hey BOB your choice will be easier in 2008 they are opening a Bass Pro in Toledo just before the 475 this way you can hit it first then head north to Cabalas then back on 94 to home it will be a nice turnaround I cant wait this way I will pass it everyday twice Im sure I will have a hard time keeping my truck from heading in to the shop there. I do like Cabalas better but if BPS is right there how can I not stop in
