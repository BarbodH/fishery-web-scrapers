11410,motv8tr,2006-12-12 21:52:00,2587,"Hey all, I'm putting together a fishing kit for my friends 3 and 5 year olds for Christmas.  I picked them up rods and reels from BPS this morning along with some micro tubes.  I was hoping to stock their new tackle boxes with barbless hooks just to be safe but forgot to look for them while I was there.  I stopped into the local Wal-Mart and CTC and couldn't find them.  Can they be bought? Where?  Thanks Maureen"
11416,irishfield,2006-12-12 22:03:00,26272,Alberta is your best bet. Around here you pretty much have to make them barbless yourself from what I've seen. I'm sure someone here knows where they can be had locally though.
11419,FishFinder,2006-12-12 22:09:00,481,"I posted a sort of similar question a while ago, seems they are pretty rare, most people advised me to pinch down the barb with plyers, you could also file it down  You could also try your local fly shop, they might have them..."
11420,Fisherman,2006-12-12 22:11:00,7201,"Pair of pliers and squeeeze, Manitoba has them too."
11424,JFR,2006-12-12 22:19:00,498,"Moe, The flyfishing shop inside BPS should carry barbless hooks.  You will mostly find them in shops catering to flyfishers.  You could take a pair of pliers and squeeze the barb down.  John"
11445,Beans,2006-12-12 23:04:00,3339,Hey Rene...check with Photoz...I'm sure he uses some for carp...makes for easier release as they are mainly hooked in the lip when you use a hair rig...  Would be a pain if you were using real worms with the youngsters but a drop of crazy glue with plastics will help keep stuff on the hook...
11453,motv8tr,2006-12-12 23:14:00,2587," Ya it might be a pain, but I thought it might be safer for them to start with...  Maureen"
11703,brickNblock,2006-12-13 15:57:00,598,"Mo, I fished a little in Alberta this past summer, and not one tackle shop sold barbless hooks that I frequented. I even fished with locals and actual tackle shop owners at times, Same thing????????/ I was real curious about it... All anyone did was pinch the barb ever so lightly until you heard a click. That usually was all it takes..then run your finger towards the point to make sure it was sufficient.  There was a post not to long back just about this and someone brought up a good point(LOL) ""Push the hook through a piece of paper and if it tugs or makes the hole bigger on the way out it is not sufficiently barbless"".... If that is what a CO might put you through...Id make double sure it worked. As this is for just a childs safety, the method I mentioned above should suffice. Pete"
11833,huntervasili,2006-12-13 22:30:00,1604,As mentioned before fly shops usually carry barbless hooks but if you use pliers to punch em down it works too... you can also test by poking it into a cotton ball... if any cotton gets stuck by the barb file it down more or crush some more...
12028,motv8tr,2006-12-14 12:38:00,2587,"Thanks for all the replys folks, guess I'll just let the boys parents take care squeezing the barbs for them.  Maureen"
12287,setomonkey,2006-12-14 23:55:00,872,"Mo,  It's really easy to do, and doesn't take long. I was in Alberta too and fishing with spinners, pinching down the barbs on a treble took no time at all.  Mike"
12290,dsn,2006-12-15 00:03:00,1018,"Try this... ebay loaded with barbless hooks, take your pick. http://search.ebay.ca/barbless-hooks_W0QQfcdZ2QQfclZ4QQfnuZ1    Will this help?  dsn"
12446,motv8tr,2006-12-15 07:57:00,2587,"Mike the problem isn't that I find it difficult to do, it's that I don't want to open a package that's a Christmas present.  DSN, the link no longer works, or at least not for me, but thanks anyway.  It does give me the idea to look there in the future, although I've never bought anything off e-bay.  maureen"
