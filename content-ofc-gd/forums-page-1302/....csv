So if you loose sight of your lure at 2 feet, you might get to view a max of 4 feet in those conditions.  I will get to see first hand in a month at Nippissing...if it freezes."

13179,Rizzo,2006-12-17 14:01:00,4754,"wow, prices just keep falling on those things.  I paid about 270 only a year and a half ago.  I'm very pleased with the unit.  In stained water I wouldn't expect a miracle from any camera no matter how expensive.  For $150 its a great toy, love it for ice fishing"
13180,MuskyBill,2006-12-17 14:02:00,311,"I've also heard Glen, that the 100' cord will come in handy, eventually."
13181,Rizzo,2006-12-17 14:09:00,4754,"I heard that too about getting the extra 50 feet of cable...I didn't bother.  Guess it depends what you're fishing for, but the deepest water I've fished is 35 feet so I've never had a problem.  If you're in search of lakers etc then yes, get the extra cable"
13337,dheitzner,2006-12-17 22:25:00,314,"i have the scout w 100' of cable, and i find it kind of a neat toy.  they are very cheaply made and despite the fact that i am super careful with it, one of the knobs on the monitor broke.  i have had the unit for about 10months and haven't had any problems withe the actual camera yet."
