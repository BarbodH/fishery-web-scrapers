12083,tonyb,2006-12-14 15:05:00,1637,"Hey guys,  I am curious to know if the Mr Heater Portable Buddy is sufficient for heating an ice hut, or if the Mr Heater Big Buddy is the better way to go?  The difference in weight of the unit is 8lbs for the Portable Buddy and 16lbs for the Big Buddy, so I am curious if the Portable Buddy is too small to get the job done.       Thanks, Tony"
12095,LeXXington,2006-12-14 15:48:00,1928,"Mr Heater Portable Buddy is sufficient for heating an ice hut.. Absolutly...  At low its warm, but when you crank it too high you will be in a t-shirt and shorts..  Besides, although its nice to be warm in an ice hut you don't want it too warm or when you walk out the door - buuuuurrrrrr"
12096,Joey,2006-12-14 15:52:00,9122,"We just bought the Mr. Heater for our ice fishing this coming season, so I don't know yet.  I'm assuming its good enough.  Joey"
12103,Mandy,2006-12-14 16:12:00,9,Does this mean we are buying a portable ice hut to go with the portable heater?
12105,tonyb,2006-12-14 16:18:00,1637,I don't know what you are talking about Mandy
12108,cityfisher,2006-12-14 16:25:00,959,I checked those ones out but didnt feel the need to spend the extra cash ... i bought the coleman blackcat at BPS for 59.99.... 3000 BTU is more than enough to heat my portable
12111,Mandy,2006-12-14 16:31:00,9,Sure you don't...
12115,ccmtcanada,2006-12-14 16:59:00,7971,"Mandy...ummm...he forgot to mention in his original post that he asking for a ""friend""  Ok...I'll admit it, I'm the one buying the portable ice hut....yeah...that's it!!!!"
12171,Aaron Shirley,2006-12-14 18:53:00,655,"Hey Mandy, I think I heard Tony mention that he wanted a 2 man portable ice hut for Christmas... you may want to pass this along to the big guy in red  Aaron"
12176,john vail,2006-12-14 19:01:00,67,"Hey people , regardless of what you buy or use, remember CO kills people yearly because of lack of proper ventilation. Be safe please"
12182,knotaclue,2006-12-14 19:42:00,136,"i emailed them back in the fall, they told me that the big buddy was not available in canada, have you found a place that sells them?Princess auto had a bunch of heaters on sale before hunting season started, i thougth the one with the fan would have been great as they bill them for indoor use also????not to sure about that????thought it might work ok in the garage???"
12185,tonyb,2006-12-14 19:48:00,1637,"Fishing world in Hamilton has them, and a bigger model than the buddy too.  It looks like it could heat a small warehouse  I think the portable buddy looks to be the right combination of portability and to provide enough heat.  On a side note, they have those Natrue Vision Pak-Shacks 1 person huts for $124.99 they are chincy but more affordable than the Fish Trap X2 I was dreaming about ($779.00 )  Tony"
12190,LeXXington,2006-12-14 19:58:00,1928,Basspro sells little Buddy and there on sale  now and again for normally $99
12194,knotaclue,2006-12-14 20:11:00,136,"I'll drop by fishing world on the way home from work to check that out,if it's the one i was thinking about this may be good,doe's it use eight d cell's to run the fan???"
12197,tonyb,2006-12-14 20:17:00,1637,I think 4 D cells knotaclue.  The bigger one may use 8.  Tony
12419,Mike the Pike,2006-12-15 04:37:00,3421,I have the 3000 BTU coleman Blackcat it heats my 2 man Frabill well enough but I would be curious coleman has a larger unit with a fan that runs off Batteries.it sells for about $112.00 though .It would be nice to have during my annual ice fishing tournament where no shelters are permitted.Just hot air blowing my way.Yup thats my next purchase. Ok Lets pray for ice
12533,Garyv,2006-12-15 15:01:00,547,"I have every heater mentioned above and although they all work fine the standard Mr. Buddy is by far the best buy for the dollars and will more than keep and ice hut not only warm but HOT should you like it that way.  Best part is even though there is normally air leaking into most huts the Buddy has a low oxygen shut off that is worth the slightly extra cost to purchase it.  Oh, and as far as the fan it's not necessary and the Big Buddy is the only unit in their buddy line up that has it."
12618,PERCHER,2006-12-15 19:39:00,787,I have tried many heaters in my portable hut.And the best one by far is the mr buddy.No need for a fan and the extra expense of batteries.The mr buddy heater is one of the safest units on the market.It is rated to heat up to 800 sq feet.
12974,aplumma,2006-12-16 20:50:00,6896,The key here is the heater must have a O2 cut off built into the heater  like the Mr Buddy has without it you can get sleepy from an CO2 build up and DIE.   Art
12979,camillj,2006-12-16 21:12:00,1988,Youd be shocked to know how little heat it takes to keep a hut comfortable ... even a small coleman cat heater will do the trick.  Definitely no need for the fan .... and yes do leave a ventilation hole open ... CO is a silent undetectable killer.
