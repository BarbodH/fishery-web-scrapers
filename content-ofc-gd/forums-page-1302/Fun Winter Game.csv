13211,Kawartha Kev,2006-12-17 15:39:00,281,How do you do a screen capture of your scores  Ron or Corey?  Kawartha Kev
13239,Corey,2006-12-17 17:03:00,355," Hit the PrtSc (Print Screen) button on your keyboard and it will capture the screen to the clipboard. From there you can plug the image into Word, Wordpad, MSPaint, Photoshop, etc.  Holding down Alt and then hitting the PrtSc key will capture just the current window, whereas just the PrtSc will capture your whole screen. What I do is usually Alt-PrtSc then I will paste the image into MSPaint. From there I can capture just the specific part of the screen I need and paste it into a new instance of MSPaint and then save the file as a jpg.  BTW, for those who don't know... there are several version fo this game out there. I just know of one that gives higher scores, simular to the previously mentions bloody pinguin link.  cd."
