She hasn't been feeling well for a couple weeks.  She found out after I left for work that we are expecting our second child. I have been trying to convince her for the longest time that for our second kid we should wait to find out if its a boy or girl untill the baby is born, she finally relented a couple months ago.  Just in time. Hmm I wonder if they frown on a guy taking parental leave and fishing all summer???"

12861,Joey,2006-12-16 05:19:00,9122,"What fantastic news.  Congratulations.  Well I waited for my son to be born before I knew if he was a boy or girl and I don't think I would have wanted it any other way, but back then, nobody ever checked to see what they were having.  It kind of makes it all the more fun!!  Joey"
