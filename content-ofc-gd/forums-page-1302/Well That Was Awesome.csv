12484,Mike the Pike,2006-12-15 13:23:00,3421,"Congrats Joey,I think your T-shirt collection has increased rather quickly."
12580,brickNblock,2006-12-15 18:01:00,598,"that was really awesome you, you, you lucky gal!!!!!!!!!!! Couldnt have happened to nicer folk. Ive had the priv of meeting Dave a few times and he seems to be the real McCoy. Sara, our daughter, (LilBrick), has recieved all kinds of neat stuff from him as well. Good on ya for donning the OFC gear Joey. Our free WFN ran out, but in the new home Ive already arranged for its connection the day we move in...guess thats why we've got the truck for 4 days..it can sit in the driveway while we watch our very own Joey on the tube. WTG gal.you rock!!!!!!!!!!!"
12658,brickNblock,2006-12-15 21:03:00,598,"Hello Joey, Charmaine here, brickNblockESS Your looking really good gal---way to go.I was impressed with your appearence on the show--- ""WAY TO GO, GAL"" Can't wait to have you over for a visit at the our new place,I'm sooooo excited about the move. It should be a really crazy xmas, but well worth all the chaos, once it's all said and done. ""MERRY CHRISTMAS TO YOU AND YOURS"" And to all the other members of the OFC Charmaine"
12661,Joey,2006-12-15 21:12:00,9122,"Bricknblockess, I love the name - that's priceless.  I can't wait to come up and see the new place also.  Enjoy it and call if you need any help.  I'm so glad things are coming around for you finally.  Thanks Joey"
12662,Greencoachdog,2006-12-15 21:13:00,8163,"That is Awesome Joey!... I'll give ya $5 for the shirt right now! You done good, and I hope somebody can post the clip 'cause I doubt we'll get anything like that down here in Redneckville!"
12664,Joey,2006-12-15 21:15:00,9122, You'll have to pry it off my cold dead body G  It's kind of priceless if you know what I mean.  I think TJ is going to get a copy of it for us.  Thanks  Joey
12697,fishindevil,2006-12-15 22:20:00,6254,"congrats,joey....WAY TO GO..   thats so cool...."
12700,Dave Mercer,2006-12-15 22:27:00,148,"Hi Joey, Just wanted to say Hi and thanks for the great job you did it was great meeting you. I love talking with hard core fishing freaks like my self. Also wanted to wish all of you a Very Merry Christmas.  Regards, Dave Mercer  P.S you would not believe how many people what a shirt now !!!!! Maybe we should make a few available as a Casting for a Cure fund raiser ?"
12088,Joey,2006-12-14 15:30:00,9122,"All I can say was that that was so cool and Dave is a great guy.  His camera crew and Tony the WFN manager were all really nice guys and great to deal with.  I felt alot calmer after meeting them and shooting the bull with Dave before filming.  We had to move a few things around in the house and go over the ""script"" and do tons of takes, but I think it turned out pretty good.  Dave pulled up and was wearing his Christmas Santa Suit    Here's the truck in my driveway.  People were honking as they passed.    Dave, in his hip santa suit talking with the crew and going over details.    Here's Dave and I after shooting.  He gave me this cool shirt    And I wore my OFC shirt the whole time TJ    They had the mic on me and we hid it well under the shirt, so it will be in the show  Its a bad picture of both of us, but oh well.    Both Dave and the WFN crew gave me lots of shirts, hats and baits.  They were truely awesome guys.  What an experience I won't soon forget.  Thanks guys, I enjoyed that and look forward to meeting you again.  They said it will air Christmas day and Boxing day starting at noon both days and will rerun periodically all day.  Woohoo, Sweet.  Cheers  Joey"

12132,charlesn,2006-12-14 17:48:00,551,"I can't say I'm surprised, the WFN team is top notch and Dave is a phenomenally funny and personable guy.  I've never heard an amateur ever have anything but extreme positives about fishing with Mr. Mercer and the Cast for a Cure thing was a really great thing to do.  Congrats Joey, look forward to seeing the segment on the tube!  Charles"
