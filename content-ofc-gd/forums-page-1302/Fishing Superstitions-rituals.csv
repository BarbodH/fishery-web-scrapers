12688,fishindevil,2006-12-15 22:10:00,6254,"fishergirl72 gave me a liilte crystal glass fish with 10kt. gold fins with a saying on the box that says the following.    you fisherman may tell your tales,of those that got away so heres a fish,not very large,but it for sure will stay.....so everytime i go fishing i pic it up and give it a rub and then i go,so everytime since the early fall ive done this i always have done well.so i guess thats my new lucky charm........the one time i didnt rub it and went i didnt catch a thing so she says its the lucky fish.......cheers"
12715,Beans,2006-12-15 22:46:00,3339,"If I see the cows in the field lying down I may as well pack up and head home...  I don't but, usually have a skunkeroo day...  Maybe I'm conditioning myself to have a bad day...  Like Norman Vincent Peal sez in the Power of Positive Thinking...hmmmmm"
12721,bpsbassman,2006-12-15 22:56:00,941,"Hey Beans, a couple of old guys from Pennsylvania told me and my boys about that over 25 yeas ago.  The rest of it was if they are feeding then everything else is feeding.  Coming home from a trip once (we'd had a slow fish), everything was feeding, Cows, horses, sheep, chickens.  I was going to turn around and go back!!"
12753,Carp,2006-12-15 23:44:00,1488,"Ya, I have to agree making sure the plug is in the boat is a ritual when I go fishing.  Can't really think of anything that stands out, but I'm sure there's a few things I do the same every time I go out."
12818,Greencoachdog,2006-12-16 02:48:00,8163,"  1.That isn't a superstition Beans... it's a fact!!!  2.I always catch more fish if I don't wear a shirt!  3.Lungelarry Posted Today, 03:39 PM Never brag to your fishing partner if your having a good day,cause the tide WILL turn......  This is also a fact!  4.If you see Wildlife moving (Deer, Turkeys, Rabbits, etc.) while traveling to your fishing destination, you'll have a good day.  5.I've also found if you don't put the plug in the back of the boat... the bilge will be cleaner when you return home than when you left, so if you want your bilge cleaned out..........  6.You will always catch a lot more and bigger fish the day before a tournament, than the day of the tournament.  7.No mattter how large or small, always take a picture of the first fish of the day.  8.It always helps to hold some small fish captive or ""hostage"" in the livewell.  9.Never eat seafood the night before a fishing trip... steak is the best ""luck"" food for fish.  10.Bananas and the people that bring them onboard should be disposed of as soon as found!!!... do you understand this Maureen?     I hope these help."
12820,ChrisK,2006-12-16 02:53:00,2772,I always make shure my OFC cap is on my head before venturing out
12833,Bly,2006-12-16 03:24:00,1556,"    Ok, I just have to ask....what is with the bananas?????  blyght"
12919,Greencoachdog,2006-12-16 14:42:00,8163,Taking bananas on a fishing trip would be the same as playing AC/DC on the biggest boom box you could find in your tree stand while deer hunting.
12921,setomonkey,2006-12-16 14:58:00,872,"I've got a favorite hat & t-shirt that I try to remember to wear when I go out for a day, but I don't always remember to.  Mike"
13016,jediangler,2006-12-16 23:20:00,1923,"I have a good luck charm. This guy!  He's a happymeal toy that came along in the boat on a family outing to a local conservation area. When my daughter got bored, she'd play with Mikey. He's stayed in the boat box (along with a jar of bubbles) for years until I set him up in the front of the boat. Kinda like a hood ornament.  Mikey is also good for holding fish that are so small, you're too embarassed to appear in the pics yourself.  And for holding musky lures, making them look more impressive.  Give em a thumbs up Mikey."
13037,Clampet,2006-12-17 00:48:00,1947,"At first I couldn't think of anything, then I realised, years ago I used to save up some eggshells to sprinkle down the hole cause it was supposed to attract the fish or something, other than that I don't have any particular  ritual or anything."
13043,huntervasili,2006-12-17 01:01:00,1604,I always bring my fishing rod otherwise I never catch anything... Just me though wont go fishing without it...
13095,jjcanoe,2006-12-17 03:44:00,744,"Always have the lucky walmart fishing hat on. It has since been passed on to my 5yr old and man what a fisherman he is.  Incudentally my luck has seemed to increase since I did this (Karma?)  Also when tying the ""trilene"" knot, 8 line wraps when fishing for trout and 6 wraps when fishing for salmon.  jjcanoe"
13134,Mike the Pike,2006-12-17 06:19:00,3421,After today I am no longer superstitious.I have this bass t-shirt that I wear in Quinte.So far the last 2 yrs when I wear it I always catch fish.  Well today fishing from shore in Montreal on the Mighty St.Lawrence......... Skunked .The shirt was on but the fish were off.Thats it no more.  Just goin fishin.Mike
13186,ccmtcanada,2006-12-17 14:27:00,7971, We have a belief that the youngest on the trip catches the most fish.  Our 4 year old always outfishes us!!!!
13193,Whopper,2006-12-17 14:56:00,2174,"LOL Wayne, we still had a great time. We'll have to try it again at a different location!    Whopper"
13230,nelly,2006-12-17 16:45:00,256,What is it with the no tuna sandwich and when the cows are laying down? I have never heard about the tuna sandwich but heard about the cow thing. What is the story behind this?
13264,irishfield,2006-12-17 17:56:00,26272, Maybe the boat was bad luck....got that licked for next season!
12491,Bly,2006-12-15 13:37:00,1556,"I was just wondering if anyone on the board has any superstitions or rituals that you go through either before or while you are fishing?  Or anything about your gear?    The reason I ask is that I have a inexpensive Canadian Tire rod/reel combo (it’s my only fishing rod)…paid around 35 bucks for the thing.  I’ve caught lots of Walleye on it this fall….including my PB 15 pounder!  To make a long story short, the reel is pretty much shot and it’s still under warranty, so I was going to take it back to the store and get a new combo.  When some of my friends found out they said “NOOO...KEEP THE ROD….JUST SWITCH OUT THE REEL!!!!”  I never really thought about the “lucky” rod until they mentioned it.   Also, if I ever pull in someone else’s tackle (and that has happened a few times this year), I don't use it.  I believe there is some kind of left over karma, because when I’ve put it on my own line, it’s gone again after a few casts!!!   Post your superstitions and rituals….could make for an interesting thread!"
12495,Terry,2006-12-15 13:42:00,14456,I don't have any superstitions/rituals well I do have one..I have to put a plug in the back of the boat  everytime I don't bad things happen and bad things have happened more times then I care to say
12500,ccmtcanada,2006-12-15 13:47:00,7971, You have a hole in your boat?  A plug seems like a necessity then.....haha.  I can see why bad things would happen....hehe
12504,FishHog,2006-12-15 13:55:00,7, LMAO.  I'm with Terry
12525,bpsbassman,2006-12-15 14:35:00,941,"Too funny Terry,  I actually follow the same ritual and have been cursed many times as well when you don't do it.  Blyght, why would you return the reel when a 15 pounder stripped the gears.  That reel should be kept and mounted as a souvenir!! I believe if you get rid of the reel your karma will go south!"
12527,snag,2006-12-15 14:38:00,1932,"Dang!  I was going to start the exact thread!!  Yeah, I told Highdrifter a while ago that I have to put down my backpack while shore fishing.  Having it on tells the fish God Neptune that you are arrogant and impatient.  Neptune rewards the Zen angler."
12532,Nemo,2006-12-15 15:00:00,727,Leave the camera at home if you want to catch something big....
12534,snag,2006-12-15 15:02:00,1932,  HAHAHAAHAHAHA  So true
12554,Bly,2006-12-15 15:59:00,1556,"Ccmt and I used to have ""net trouble"", only caught anything when we left the thing in the car or at home  bpsbassman...  Never really thought about keeping the reel as a souvenir, I will have to give that some thought and I certianly don't want my karma going south!  blyght"
12556,spanky,2006-12-15 16:07:00,195,"Okay, so there's this Metro tow truck, used for towing big rigs, if we see it at any point during the day we don't go fishing... if we're fishng already, we pack up and head home, if we're on the way to our fishing spot we turn around and go home... seen it numerous times while planning on fishing that day and have NEVER caught a single fish when we did"
12558,Rich,2006-12-15 16:19:00,3927, Haha yeah and dont try and trick karma by keeping your camera phone on you instead!
12560,Fishandchips,2006-12-15 16:30:00,72,"I never let anyone on a boat with bananas or Tunafish sandwiches,thats just a jinx waiting to happen , Brian"
12561,Whopper,2006-12-15 16:31:00,2174,"Never been into superstitions, but after a deep sea charter in Hawaii a few years back I don't like to see bananas in the boat I do have a favorite rod though  Whopper"
12564,lunkerbasshunter,2006-12-15 16:54:00,2585,I almost always spark up a cigar if im alone.  Cheers!
12566,MuskyBill,2006-12-15 17:08:00,311,"My lucky #3 Earnhardt camo hat had better be on my head, or my confidence goes south...."
12572,troutologist,2006-12-15 17:26:00,951,Yup if the camo hat isnt along for the ride i throw bare hooks cuz i have no faith
12575,brickNblock,2006-12-15 17:40:00,598,"Great thread Blyght.... and a long overdue CONGRATS on your PB this year Superstitions.....  ....not really But I have found Ive become increasingly nervous about going fishing with Mark, (fishdawg). The guy always out fishes me...and even more.. any place Ive brought him to...neither one of us catch a thing. Maybe I'll wear a backpack or bring my childhood reel with me this year on the ice for whities"
12576,irishfield,2006-12-15 17:47:00,26272,I find I have a GREAT day no matter what when I bring a certain Brunette along with me...    On the other hand when I bring this ugly bugger my catching goes for a crap.. 
12578,brickNblock,2006-12-15 17:51:00,598,geeeze Wayne.... that looks alot like burger king....... sorry Phil.... Go 'buckeyes
12640,kemper,2006-12-15 20:23:00,2232,I always sacrifice a lure to the fish gods at the start of my annual week long trip
12642,Garyv,2006-12-15 20:32:00,547,"I've worn this hat in Spring, Summer and early Fall for years, and yes it stays in the boat so I don't loose it. "
12672,Lungelarry,2006-12-15 21:39:00,294,"Never catch a fish on the first cast.....it will also be your last Never take out the net or pliers until a fish is hooked... Always honk your car horn at the exact same spot on the trip to the fishing spot If you have a great day of fishing and you go the next day ,you Better wear the same underwear.... Never brag to your fishing partner if your having a good day,cause the tide WILL turn......"
12679,bassmaster4,2006-12-15 21:49:00,801,i never bring the landing net cuz then i never catch anything all the times i have a big fish on the net isnt there with us
12684,fishdawg,2006-12-15 22:06:00,912,"  ok fine Pete, next time we're trolling  & we're changing baits, you reel 'em in & pick up the ""drowning presents"" ok?"
12687,Crazyhook,2006-12-15 22:09:00,1154,Do not get out the camera until the fish is landed!!!  I have some clothing that is luck and unlucky...
