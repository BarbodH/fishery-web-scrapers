12592,Entropy,2006-12-15 18:41:00,747,we're going to have problems
12605,cityfisher,2006-12-15 19:11:00,959,almost booked rob hyatt bungalow for the first week...glad i didnt... doubt there will be safe ice for then
12609,John,2006-12-15 19:17:00,2956,Do we have a contingency plan Terry?
12611,Rich Clemens,2006-12-15 19:20:00,3131,"No offense friends but,  I really don't mind if you keep the cold air up there and we'll keep the warm down here.   Just trying to help out you hard water lovers."
12616,Terry,2006-12-15 19:28:00,14456,I don't know John that's why I put the post up  I have never spent a weekend in a hut that's parked on shore
12621,charlesn,2006-12-15 19:42:00,551,"Just out of curiosity, it there any regulations against using a boat during typical ice fishing season?  That is, if it was open enough for boating of course.  The guys on the lower niagara use their boats all winter long.  Charles"
12626,Terry,2006-12-15 19:57:00,14456,"it's ok to use a boat... but for some reason scogug seems to state ""open season for ice fishing' in one of their blurbs so that could be iffy"
12653,FinS,2006-12-15 20:56:00,463,you might half to consider somewhere more north if these warm temps keep up DantheMan probably has some good fishing ice up in his area  Ill be up that way in the new year cant wait
12718,DanTheMan,2006-12-15 22:50:00,257," Hmmm, Not sure about that bud.We have 0 ice here also now.And thats insane for Timmins.Last year I took out my hut on Dec 21 on Nighthawk wich is 6 days from now.Well, all I see now  is open water.We can probly take out our boats now!!!!  Its a bit scary"
12722,dwc67,2006-12-15 22:57:00,140,i have the weekend booked so if the huts a no go i will get a hotel and walk on with the trap.     damn americans get their own cold weather leave ours alone
