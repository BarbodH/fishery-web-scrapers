12453,brickNblock,2006-12-15 10:52:00,598,"....a recent annual Conference held in Winnipeg by P.E.T.A, where one speaker representing the O.F.A.H put up a brave debate over P3TA's recent slew of slanderish advertising methods only to be met with a big thumbs down climbed aboard a small plane to return home to Toronto afterward.  ...the tiny plane encountered severe wind turbulance from off of Lake Superior and crashed just west of Espanola.  ...the 11 survivors were clinging whiteknuckled to a vine, perched high up on a rock face of the Great Canadian Shield.  Of these survivors, were 10 members of P3TA and the lone rep from OFAH.  ...as a group, no longer reps for a cause, they decided that one person must let go so the vine wouldnt break and all would perish.  ...the silence was deafening.....No volunteers!  ...finally the rep from OFAH gave a truly touching speech and said he would sacrifice himself to save the others.  ...The 10 members from P3TA Applauded."
