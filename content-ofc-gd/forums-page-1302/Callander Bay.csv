12712,Guest gbfisher,2006-12-15 22:44:00,0,well where Rob is usually its OK....last year was the same and he made it out.  JUST!  Sucks not knowing but Im sure it will freeze...Heres hoping anyway!
12714,Clampet,2006-12-15 22:45:00,1947,A couple of cold (-30 C) nights will fix everything.
12757,dheitzner,2006-12-15 23:53:00,314,thanks for the replies/hope fellas
12786,fishdawg,2006-12-16 01:04:00,912,in the same boat as you but with a different operator  - fingers & toes crossed it gets cold FAST!
