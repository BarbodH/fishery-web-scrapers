11706,bpsbassman,2006-12-13 16:01:00,941,"Actually, East Coast music is our favourite music to play and so many fishing/water related songs. We also love doing Buddy Wasisname & the other fellers and Stan Roger's songs."
11713,brickNblock,2006-12-13 16:13:00,598,"Rog.... What are the chances of hearing you fellas at an OFC g2g one of these days? We should have a talent night one time I think.....Rick, w/douG,Roy etc...as well. Peter"
11831,huntervasili,2006-12-13 22:21:00,1604,Thanks for sharing that... Awesome tune ... Glad there is some sort of song I can relate to... Thanks again
11875,mistyjr1,2006-12-13 23:37:00,97,Roger that is a great song!! Way to go!
12739,Ron,2006-12-15 23:21:00,1683,"Well, I got off to a slow start. I saved the song on the computer and next thing you know, it is lost in the files of nowhere land.  I was digging up some info for another project, Low and behold, I find it!  A great song Roger! I could enjoy listening to you guys playing anywhere! Especially around a camp fire.  Thanks for making it availible for us.  Man, that smile is addictive!"
10830,bpsbassman,2006-12-11 05:00:00,941,"As some of you know I am a proud member of Fishguts, a band made up of fishing buddies. We are a ""Beer Band"" (one step below a Garage Band)  . The band is ""Dedicated to the pursuit of good fun, good fishing and a little music along the way."" We were asked to come up with a song for Christmas, so we put this one together.  The basic theme is that the excitement on the night before a fishing trip is just like Christmas eve when you were a kid and every Fishing trip is like Christmas all over again. Some of the pictures may be familiar and thanks to Musky Bill for the Loon shot. Sending this out to all my fellow OFNers.   Merry Christmas, hope you enjoy it.

10842,Roy,2006-12-11 06:25:00,13728,"Just wonderful, Roger and friends! That's a keeper for sure....sounds like something we should all learn for around the campfire at Lakair (or wherever).  Great stuff. Thank you for posting it Roger."
10850,lew,2006-12-11 09:14:00,12767,"WTG Roger, that was awesome and thanks, I can't think of a better way to start my day"

10858,ChrisK,2006-12-11 11:02:00,2772,"You guys sound great !!Love the video footage as well... Nice way to start the day,thanx for sharing....  Cheers !!!"
10878,Guest mistyriver1,2006-12-11 13:05:00,0,"Roger, that was awesome.  Thanks for posting.  It was great to see you at BPS yesterday. Even though I only went up to get ""a few things"", I still walked out $70 poorer."
10914,dustink,2006-12-11 16:07:00,526,Great Stuff Roger!!  dk
10919,fishdawg,2006-12-11 16:17:00,912,wow!  well done Fish Guts great use of the slideshow photos
10922,MuskyBill,2006-12-11 16:30:00,311,"That was excellent, Roger!!  Very impressive, the great tune & video just made my day..."
10931,bpsbassman,2006-12-11 16:47:00,941,"Thanks for all the great feedback.  We had a lot of fun (and a barrel of laughs) doing it.  That's what its all about. I must have done 10 takes trying to get my lyrics straight.  The problem was that after I screwed it up the first time, the other guys had to leave the room they were laughing so hard.  Then every time after that that I screwed up the guffaws would start coming from the next room.  By the time I finished, the guys had tears in their eyes. I can't help but laugh again while I write this. We have no illusions of who we are, just a bunch of guys trying to play music and having a good time.  The purpose of recording is to have something to pass on to those that follow, to give our children, grandchildren and possibly further, a sense of why they're so screwed up. I have to say that one of the biggest rushes I've ever had in my life is driving down the road with the grandkids in the back seat singing ""Wide Gaps and Dingers, Spinners and Spoons.  Come off the water in the light of the moon"".  That's the best.  Nice seeing you guys too Jim, but with the two boys with you, that only works out to just a little over $20 each!"
10970,Blake,2006-12-11 19:41:00,418,a great song thanks for sharing

11667,sologill,2006-12-13 14:38:00,9,"Wow! Hi Folks...  I'm a ""newbie"" on the board (from Cambridge), and a memeber of FishGuts. Actually I've been a ""lurker"" for a while with a couple of posts on the old board, trying to figure out why BPSBassman spends so much time here. I'm starting to get it. Great feedback on the song from all you folks, especially given it was our first attempt at anything original. Thanks to all, but I think the FishGuts gang should count on keeping our day jobs."
11671,cityfisher,2006-12-13 14:45:00,959,Very nice !! its a catchy tune !!
