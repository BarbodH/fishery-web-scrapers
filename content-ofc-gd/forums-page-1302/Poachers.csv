12483,Terry,2006-12-15 13:22:00,14456,I hope it isn't another one that magically disappears...  or maybe they just unpinned it and worked it's way to the back pages
12493,Bly,2006-12-15 13:42:00,1556,here are two of the threads  MNR Cuts = This??  and  Poachers Beware
12496,Marc Thorpe,2006-12-15 13:43:00,621,has anything been done? Who are they ?
12590,wolfville,2006-12-15 18:38:00,396,"Poachers, poachers, when do they learn.... I was at my local swim about two weeks ago and this other guy was fishing with not one, not two, but THREE rods from shore. I told him it's illegal and he looked around and said to me like a good old friend ""It's okay, no CO will come this time of the year...."" I was like?  I called tips-mnr and as usual nothing happened. I am willing to PAY for the co to be at the scene to catch these guys if it has to be that sad.  When I was leaving I saw his net with about 5 fish in it... felt raped. This was not the only guy doing that, almost every one fishing there was using multiple rods except me, and they acted like I was stupid not doing the same.  Sorry if this post is a bit off the original topic ... If there is a 1-900 number to the CO please let me know."
12595,misfish,2006-12-15 18:50:00,29133,Hey Randy how goes. Ignorance is everywhere it seems.Sad that your call was not answered by them showing up.  I believe I read there was an investigation going on.Might be right might be wrong.LOL
12649,huntervasili,2006-12-15 20:48:00,1604,This is why we need capital punishment...  j/k ... or am I ?
12724,fishindevil,2006-12-15 23:03:00,6254,"cant the regular police do something,like hold them or at least get there info so that later they can be charged,when a co is available....its very disturbing..."
12775,ecmilley,2006-12-16 00:36:00,2163,just call the regular police they can lay a charge under the fish&game act
12846,Ron,2006-12-16 04:35:00,1683,An investigation is under way. I hope they convict the guys.
