If there is anything else you would like to add as to what you either like about your fishfinder or what your wish list would be please post it. In one week I will be compiling the survey information and having a meeting with my software engineer.  Thanks again everyone for your generous posts!  Matthew"
12565,yzer93,2006-12-15 16:56:00,7,I find trolling speed and the accuracy of the depth even in shallow water crucial on any unit.  I have a fisheasy and it's decent for the money i got it for....
12675,fishindevil,2006-12-15 21:45:00,6254,"rick you had it right,my lowrance 339IGPS...has it all,but it also costs $1,000 bucks,you only get what you pay for....and it has the most power of any unit under almost 5,000 .i learned that along time ago and you need lots of power if you are deep fishing or going at high speeds,with 4000watts of power and a dual frequency,its amazing detail, with a 200kh/50kh what i can see on my unit is amazing i can track cannon balls or see a double thermocline,its awsome....if you dont mind spending a grand than there is no equal, my advice is do your homework....cheers"
11233,Vanselena,2006-12-12 13:34:00,269,"Hi folks,  I'm designing a new fishfinder and really would like it to be designed by fisherman. So if you could have any feature on a sonar unit, what would it be? Also what features do you find to be useless?  For me personally I prefer a big screen and big buttons for my fat fingers...lol. Things that annoy me are having to be a computer expert just to run my sonar unit, most of the features I never use because I can't find them,,,grrr.  How about you? Now's your chance to get it all out and if enough people agree then you will influence how your future fishfinder will look and feel.  Thanks,  Matthew"
11244,Terry,2006-12-12 14:08:00,14456,are you talking flasher or LCD
11245,Roy,2006-12-12 14:11:00,13728,"Are these going to have the 6"" transducers?"
11263,Entropy,2006-12-12 15:09:00,747,"for LCD, detail and temps."
11280,FishHog,2006-12-12 15:47:00,7,"automatic fish ID is an absolute waste if you ask me.  I don't need to see little fish symbols, just show me the sonar return.  Plus, why to these auto fish always swim in the same direction.  Automatic depth changes are OK, but they also need to reverse themselves.  I hate when the unit switches to 60' depth, then I get back into 20 and am still looking at a 60' screen."
11282,setomonkey,2006-12-12 15:52:00,872,Decent sized screen and fast pickup of signal so you can motor to a new spot and be able to tell depth.  Mike
11285,Guest gbfisher,2006-12-12 15:55:00,0,Usless feature?...........fish ID!.....  With how fast they come out with new FF's and the fact that you have been talking about this FF of yours for years now. I can't see why I would ever buy another to replace the one I have now...unless it breaks or I do.....  in that case I would buy another Lowrance. If I didnt break that is.  Good luck with yer ventures Vans. When are you putting it on the market?  
11290,Photoz,2006-12-12 16:08:00,792,"Hey GB . . . .    you want I should hold a spot in line for you, to pick up Vans new flasher / fishfinder when he markets it? I was gonna go to the FL20 . . . .     but I think I'll wait just a bit more!"
11295,Guest gbfisher,2006-12-12 16:18:00,0,  OH MAN....that would be great!  Thanks Steve!
11360,Fang,2006-12-12 20:04:00,1330,"power what a 1500 watt finder pick up is totally different than a 4000 watt  pixel definition - gotta be 480 minimum  dual transducer function narrow/wide cone  make the screen highly visible from all angles  5"" minimum screen size  If you want to do something different, make the front all screen. put the adjustment buttons on the top or side of the unit. Buttons now take up way to much real estate that could be used for screen. Look at a computer screen and see how much the adjustment buttons take up.  1 button temp/speed control. Have it toggle through options as you push the button."
11363,misfish,2006-12-12 20:09:00,29133," Ok I understood some of that,but lost metoggle through.  I do like the idea of a nice big flat screen.Maybe hook up a SPS for those slow days.LOL"
11364,Vanselena,2006-12-12 20:12:00,269,The first unit will likely be an LCD.
11376,Fang,2006-12-12 20:34:00,1330,press button once and speed shows up press it a second time and speed and temp shows press it a third and only temp press it once more and temp disappears  I run mine on auto about 95% of the time so having to adjust at set up is not a big deal but one thing I wish my lowrance models would have is a fav settings switch where I could run on auto and then pop it into manual with last settings still there  Also I hate having to turn off fish ID and teunr on speed and temp every time i turn on my Eagle.
11387,bigfish1965,2006-12-12 20:46:00,3382,A few things I would like to see... 
11391,Headhunter,2006-12-12 20:50:00,5703,"I'll keep this simple... how about a screen you can read from any angle! Also, how about a screen that you can see/read in bright sunlight. Or, a machine that can be updated on line with a simple usb connection to a computer for up loading any new s/w releases/upgrades/mapping. HH"
11396,Terry,2006-12-12 21:02:00,14456,"well ,lots of  vertical pixels... horizontal is  just history but it's nice to have some history  i say get rid of all the stupid bells and whistles..except people seem to buy  the ones that sound like a slot machine paying off every time a weed floats by"
11397,ccmtcanada,2006-12-12 21:04:00,7971,I'd like one that has a boat attached to it...then I'd be looking to buy...retail should be under $200
11402,Fisherman,2006-12-12 21:21:00,7201,"How about a scratchproof screen, even when carefull you end up with a hazy screen after a while.  Make the case out of a lighter colour, black in the sunlight can't be good for the electronics.  Connectors should be non corroding.  How about a transducer cable thats 5 feet, I always have a ball of spaggetti wrapped up in one corner.  Good luck, hope to see a prototype."
11432,Chris Cross,2006-12-12 22:37:00,46,"My new unit has a depth alarm, saved hitting bottom more than once. Maybe a depth window. Where you get an alarm if you go to deep or too shallow. CX"
11578,Vanselena,2006-12-13 04:11:00,269,"Great comments, please keep them coming!"
11589,Ron,2006-12-13 04:59:00,1683,"  Now that is one feature I would really like.  I also like the idea of one button, my old... crap... I can't even remember the name of it. Someting tournament Pro something or other, made by Bottom Line.  Anyways it had one button, push to turn on unit, push again to go through options, turn dial to option, push to highlight option, so on....  Real easy to operate.  Another option I like is the ""real time"" display. Sure a flasher might be quicker but do you really need to have mili seconds? A 1/2 or 1 second delay is not bad.  Develop a transducer that will work as a through hull design for Aluminum boats."
11592,tschirk,2006-12-13 05:16:00,261,A speed / distance scale along horizontal access so I cann see how far back the target has passed behind the boat.
11631,Fish Farmer,2006-12-13 12:40:00,2234,"Go with the CRT instead of LCD it's a better definition. Have trolling speed speed in time GPS, so you don't have the little wheel getting fouled up. Swivel base. Just some info. There is going to be new things happening in the fish finder industry with in a year or two  ."
11950,Vanselena,2006-12-14 02:14:00,269,"Farmer I agree with CRT having better definition and also updates faster. That being said we will likely be looking at having a CRT and LCD model.  Great posts, keep them coming!  Matthew"
