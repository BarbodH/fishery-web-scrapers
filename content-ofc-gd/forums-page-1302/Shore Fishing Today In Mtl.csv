12953,Mike the Pike,2006-12-16 18:53:00,3421,Well some of you pike fisherman from Ontarion inspired me to take my son fishing this morning on the St.Lawrence river from shore.We tried for a few hours but unfortuanately caught nothing.I decided to drop all that I had to do this morning and just spend some time with my son.Although he did not catch anything my little guy enjoyed the outing skipping rocks picking up some driftwood and he even found some worms.We got close to a canadian coast guard hover craft.We also saw what those huge buoys look kike out of water.Not too cold this morning.I can not believe we were shore fishing this morning December 16th.There were about a dozen boats out I wish I would have not put mine away.                       Makes me wonder why did so many do this with the boat?    Has anyone thought that maybe the boat is coming back and the ice shelter is going to stay packed away.  Global warming sucks.Mike
12959,Eddyk,2006-12-16 19:47:00,195,I agree with you Mike. Every day this week I get up and wish I hadnt put my boat away so early but what can you do. LOL
