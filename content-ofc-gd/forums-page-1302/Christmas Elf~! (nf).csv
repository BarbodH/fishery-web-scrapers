12370,danc,2006-12-15 03:24:00,4677,That's weird. He wore the same costume and did the exact same dance the entire 3 days that I spent with him last September.
12420,Ron,2006-12-15 04:39:00,1683,"Oh Iv'e seen him dance like that before, not a pretty site. I am very afraid to share a boat with him."
