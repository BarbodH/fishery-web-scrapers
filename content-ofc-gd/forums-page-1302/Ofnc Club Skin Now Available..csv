13092,bigfish1965,2006-12-17 03:34:00,3382,Here it is. This is our 'Club House' skin. Spell Check won't be available till Tuesday. This will be the last skin version available untill we go to the 2.2 software version. That is scheduled to be done by Mid January. Our beta testors have already seen the 2.2 version and seemed to like it.

13112,bpsbassman,2006-12-17 04:25:00,941,"Great job Rick & Team!! Obviously, from my perspective the loon is a very nice touch. Ron, the loon is okay when you load the skin. I'm wearing it right now!!"
13113,bigfish1965,2006-12-17 04:25:00,3382,What screen resolution are you using Ron?
13118,Ron,2006-12-17 04:59:00,1683,1024  768
13122,tjsa,2006-12-17 05:18:00,1578,"I, like Ron, see what Ron has pictured. When I hit reload, I see the entire header until the page completes loading, then it is back to what Ron has pictured. If I switch to 1280 x 1024, I can see the entire header, but the text is too small for my old eyes, even on a 19"" monitor."
13125,bigfish1965,2006-12-17 05:28:00,3382,I cropped the left image a bit more..should be okay now.
13126,Ron,2006-12-17 05:41:00,1683,"Yup, better, much, thanks, I like!  The colors are much easier on the eyes too!"
13127,tjsa,2006-12-17 05:42:00,1578,"Yup, can see it all now."
13145,lew,2006-12-17 08:36:00,12767,"Well done Rick, nice to have a few choices"
13147,Fisherman,2006-12-17 11:07:00,7201,"Ah sweet, nice contrast, much easier on the eyes, thanks."
13160,Rich Clemens,2006-12-17 12:52:00,3131,Cool beans.   I'm gonna stick with the Christmas spirit a while yet.
