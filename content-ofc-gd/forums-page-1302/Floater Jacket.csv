They were on for around a $100 usually $199.They are the Nautilus NC700 model, does any one have any input into this model good or bad."

Only complaint I'd have with it was the hood, or should I say the lack there of, until I ordered one in. Still, it's just a nylon shell of a hood, but it does brake the wind. HH"
