12946,Chris Cross,2006-12-16 17:19:00,46,"Lew, by the numbers you have the right prop. You are getting right on the max rpm, thats what you are looking for. Find out what size of prop you got and get a stainless the same. Your prop size will be something like 13 x 19. The first # is the diameter of the outside of blades. The second # is the pitch. Pitch being the angle of the blades. Pitch is measured in inches. So the above #'s are 13 inches diameter by 19 inch pitch. The pitch is 19 inches travel forward in 1 full turn of the prop. When you know your prop size, let me know. I might have one in stock. I keep a few good used stainless in stock. The price is usually 150 to 400. CX"

13007,Chris Cross,2006-12-16 23:02:00,46,That sounds like a darn good plan. Use the aluminum one when you could hit or ice. Save the stainless for deep and familiar waters. Aluminum is more forgiving when you hit {a rock). Stainless tends to do more damage to your lower unit when you hit. CX
12942,JPD,2006-12-16 16:51:00,296,"Hi Lew. if you look on ebay, which is where you will find the best deal, you should be able to get a nice Merc or Yamaha stainless for around $150 + shipping which is way better than the $600 deal suggested price  Find out the pitch and diameter of the prop before you go looking though. There are many models out there and only take ones that have not been re built or dinged.  You should see around 3 or more MPH with a stainless and don't worry about having a Yamaha prop on there, I ran them on my 90hp and they are good props and very fast as well.  Good Luck  JP  Here's a link to ebay http://motors.listings.ebay.com/Boat-Parts...ListingItemList"
