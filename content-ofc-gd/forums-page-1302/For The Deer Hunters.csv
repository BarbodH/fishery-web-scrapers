12669,dsn,2006-12-15 21:34:00,1018,They should have taken a pic of the deer.  Would be interesting to see things like this in stead of just a report. Just mu opinion as proof.   But then again maybe better not see it Or I'll get sick to my stomach. LOL   dsn
12854,verno,2006-12-16 04:55:00,178,"Not a bad deal. 1 deer, 7 lamps."
13014,tjsa,2006-12-16 23:14:00,1578,"dsn, there was a link to more pictures of that deer at the bottom of the article. Not what we pictured in our minds though. Small appendages at best, not full grown legs."
13033,huntervasili,2006-12-17 00:33:00,1604,wouldnt really wanna eat that guy... lol
