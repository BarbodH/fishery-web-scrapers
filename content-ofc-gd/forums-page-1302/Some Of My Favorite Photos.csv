6979,SlowPoke,2006-11-30 20:39:00,2984, My photos were taken on a Sony F717 5MP... nice camara in its day but no comparison to the DSLR's of today (at the same price!) -Brian

Sauble Beach   Very cooperative subject. I took several shots of this guy including a super tight macro that I had to clean the lens afterwards.   Daybreak on Simcoe   Springbank Park poser   I like this shot for some reason   Hungry Kitty sizing up lunch taken through a dirty window   Stress relief   A little cold for swimming... love the candid shots!   Same day, twelve hours later   Hope you enjoyed some of my favourites! -Brian"

6799,bpsbassman,2006-11-30 12:57:00,941,"Just awesome shots guys.  Too many to comment on.  Hopefully, DanC and MooseBunk will contribute as well.  One of the wonderful things about being here.  I need to bookmark this thread for those mid winter blues.  These shots take you to another place in time. Like Whopper, I can't wait to get out and start putting my new Canon S3 to work."

6824,Cast-Away,2006-11-30 13:30:00,790,Great shots guys! Here are few of mine.   My dog swam by when I was crouched down in the water to take this scenery shot.    Here is my fishing buddy at the end of her rope in our backyard watching her favourite pals. You should see her reaction in the boat when she sees a fish on the line!  
6842,Smokey,2006-11-30 14:25:00,1278,Great shots everyone. Thanks

6871,setomonkey,2006-11-30 15:54:00,872,"Amazing pics guys, what kind of resolution cameras do you have? We have a 4 megapixel camera that's several years old, good enough for casual photos, fishing & cottaging but I don't think good enough for the kinds of shots you are posting here...  Mike"
6875,Rizzo,2006-11-30 16:01:00,4754,"wow, those are some great photos being posted.  Some real talent here, makes my photos look like a pile of puke"
6883,bpsbassman,2006-11-30 16:17:00,941,"Dustin, where is your ducks at dusk shot?? I love that one."
6886,danc,2006-11-30 16:20:00,4677,  Mike. I took this shot with a 3 mp camera that was several years old. And I printed an 8x10 of it that came out exceptionally sharp. mp's are only part of the puzzle. The camera that I used for this shot had a 10x optical zoom which really came in handy for this shot.  
6902,fishindevil,2006-11-30 17:11:00,6254,"WOW....  great pics guys ,we are a very talented bunch....."
6933,dustink,2006-11-30 18:21:00,526,"Roger....I think this is the one you are talking about.  It was taken in a couple of summers ago at Five Mile Lake (South of Chapleau, ON):    "
6948,bpsbassman,2006-11-30 19:07:00,941,"That's the one Dustin!! C'mon Dan, you've got more exceptional shots.  Let's see 'em!  Not in the same league, but a few of my favourites:  Bass Opening this year    My son and Grandson studying a worm rig  "

6965,irishfield,2006-11-30 20:00:00,26272,On dial up I haven't been able to view the whole first page..but some GREAT stuff there guys. These ones are probably no where as good as most but some of my favs.  Daughter's shots off her 23rd floor balcony on Wellesley..looking towards the DVP. Pink Floyd cover material.  ..and her wet and tattered looking resident Falcon on her rail...shot thru a filthy window.  My wildlife favs from last year on my cheap kodak 210P Owl that flew into my daughters truck and unfortunately passed due to the contusion/broken wing  Gerti...the reincarnation of my black lab Rikki..  My favourite from this year. November 10 on Lake Temagami 
6967,Ron,2006-11-30 20:02:00,1683, I have always like that phot Dustin. That whole picture says nothing but Peace and Quite.  Can I use it for my background on my computer?
6973,cisco,2006-11-30 20:21:00,597,"Great shots folks! Hey Wayne, that peregrine pic brings back memories of while with MNR on Wellesley Whitney Block when I was accompanying the peregrine specialists to the Sunlife Building where we all went through their boardroom to get to the hack box monitors to observe the boxes on the roof. The top executives at Sunlife acted like doting parents re the falcons. That bird your daughter shot is the result of  lots of caring and committed people I had the pleasure of working with back then.  By the way, how recent is the shot? Maybe we can find out that bird's name.  Sad to say that some died by hitting hydro lines and other cables, and a taxi cab collision accounted for another......"
6977,Spiel,2006-11-30 20:36:00,9065,"....Great pictures Ron, I'm sure you can appreciate this one. While I did snap the picture it was admitedly taken with Dan's camera.  "
