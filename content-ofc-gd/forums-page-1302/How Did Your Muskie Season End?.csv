12734,Guest Trophymuskie,2006-12-15 23:14:00,0,I went out yesterday with muskiematt and I managed to catch one on the smaller side of the scale. At least it's nice to end the Ontario fishing season without a skunk.

12741,Guest gbfisher,2006-12-15 23:25:00,0,Mine ended a couple weeks back....  This picture pretty much made my mind up for me.    A buddy of mine was out yesterday and caught one of them silly looking green toothy critters Lew...you know the ones...HA HA HA HA  Here's looking at next year!!!  
12743,Ron,2006-12-15 23:31:00,1683,"Same here Eh,  I was hoping to get out yesterday and with any luck today as well.  Well, I got back a ""little"" late from the Hamilton MCI meeting (2:30 AM). But, I had also a painter lined up for a job on Thurs AM. Wednesday, I got called away from the drywall job to snake a clogged line. So... after the MCI meeting, I go and finish the drywall (4 AM). By now, I am burnt out, Thursday is a bust for fishing. On my way home from Hamilton, I get a whining noise from the rear end of the truck.  Today was spent getting new pinion bearings in the rear axle of the truck! I would have much rather the bearings on the boat trailer go! LOL  Well, boat is going in storage Sat, muskie gear will be put away tonight.  On the up side, I had a great season, got to fish a lot of new water, some of it will see me again next year, some of it won't."
12744,Alumacraft,2006-12-15 23:31:00,139,Mine ended with 2 solid weeks of brown water on the Niagara.Damn high winds on Erie.I hope we get some colder temps and north winds so we can get back too some incredible steelhead fishing. Rob
