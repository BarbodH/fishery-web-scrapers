12984,brifishrgy,2006-12-16 21:29:00,559,Planning on heading out on the hardwater ( if we ever get any) for some pike fishing ... never cleaned one before so I though id search the web ... found this video .... makes it look easy   
12995,Corey,2006-12-16 22:21:00,355,The 5 fillet method is much easier if you ask me. There is a video out there but the site seems to be down at this point. If I can find another copy of it floating around somewhere.  cd.
12999,tjsa,2006-12-16 22:37:00,1578,"I know the video you mean Cory, but yes, the site is not there, been trying to access it for 20 minutes to provide the link.  And, I do prefer the 5 fillet version of filleting a pike.  A little bit of wastage of meat, but not much. The one brifshrgy posted may save a bit more flesh. Not much, but every bit helps."
13000,Guest gbfisher,2006-12-16 22:37:00,0,5 bone method is the best way. A lot easier. Look up 5 bone pike method on google. Its in french but you will see it is way easier to cut. Good luck. Pike are a fish I look forward to eating every season.  
13036,Clampet,2006-12-17 00:42:00,1947,Thanks for the weblink. The last time I cleaned Pike I could have used that chart.  http://books.google.ca/books?vid=ISBN08657...TJg93ZeiGXtScbI
13045,huntervasili,2006-12-17 01:17:00,1604,now all you have to do is catch the fish

13075,nelly,2006-12-17 02:41:00,256,"The only problem I have is the back. If I go too deep, I still have the y-bones and if I don't, lots of wasted meat."
13078,Corey,2006-12-17 02:48:00,355,"Snowball,  That is the video I was looking for. fishingbuddys site is down, glad you found it.  Nelly,  I haven't had that issue yet, you just have to take your time getting down to the right depth. You can stick you fingers into the initial cut to feel for the bones.  cd."
13090,brifishrgy,2006-12-17 03:28:00,559,fishing buddies method looks like it is a litle easier ... just gonna have to get some pike and try it both ways
