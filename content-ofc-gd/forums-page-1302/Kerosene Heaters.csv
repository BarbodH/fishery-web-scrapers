The only thing is if you get the kerosene on your hands, it may affect your catching for the day. Stinks like diesel."
13446,PERCHER,2006-12-18 02:31:00,787,Every time I was in a hut with a kerosene heater I ended up tired with a headache .I really dont care for the odor of a kerosene heater.I would spend the extra and buy a Mr Buddy.Just my 2 cents.
