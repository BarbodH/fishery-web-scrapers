12515,snag,2006-12-15 14:21:00,1932," Love to hang with you Blyght. I would love a few walleye sessions with you too!  Cliff explained your nocturnal routine to me.  Actually, the same way in which you systematically cracked the walleye code applies to Pike (and I guess all fish!)  One day we'll meet and I'll be revealed as the hack/has-been that I really am.  Cheers!"
12535,snag,2006-12-15 15:05:00,1932," Wow first post!  Thanks,  Now you'll have to give everyone an intro  Welcome aboard Billfish!"
12573,brickNblock,2006-12-15 17:34:00,598,"Nice fish there snag. Got out to the islands early this year just the one time with my youngest and just havent made the time to get back again. It's OK, I can live it through you guys who frequent the islands. Sorry to hear about your un-answered calls from DSN..... Your reports are freaking hilarious....keep it up! peter"
12668,mistyjr1,2006-12-15 21:31:00,97,Nice pike Snag!!!!
12717,The Urban Fisherman,2006-12-15 22:50:00,2050,duuuuuude you're the TO pike non-slayer!  wicked post  uf
12814,dsn,2006-12-16 02:33:00,1018, Huh? Unanswered calls? I didn't hear the phone ring. LOL
12849,snag,2006-12-16 04:42:00,1932," DSN is a stand up guy.  He has lent me lures and knowledge.  Again, he's a real diehard.  ""When the student is ready, the master will appear""   See you when we most and least expect in DSN!"
12917,OhioFisherman,2006-12-16 14:31:00,6623,Congrats! A nice fat fish!
12136,snag,2006-12-14 17:53:00,1932,"Went out to a spot that is a hit and miss kinda location. When they hit, they tend to be big.  It was beautiful. Warm, calm. (last night the forecast said 25-30km winds!?)  Not a soul in sight.   Noooobody  El' zippo humanoid count.  Except this OFC dude. That's DSN. I loathe him.  Gosh, look at all the fog that rolled in.  We were fishing on opposite sides of a bay when I felt a Bump and then a BANG  and then a KAZOWEE! A big ol' pike took in my deep diving Musky lure. And broke it!!!!   Here is the pic I always take in case I lose it!    And here is the pic that never does justice. (The pic could have been better if DSN wasn't such a wuss and swam over to help, but NOOOOOO. I'm holding a grudge against him now and I would ask that all of you spite him with me, together. Thanks.)  Nice and big and heavy. If you look close, there is a bubble/tumor on it's head. I'm hoping to catch it again with such a distinct mark. Again, no measurements (blame DSN) so I'll never know if it was a PB.  Note: I will keep posting the titles with PB in them because it really seems to work at sucking you in to have a look and gratifying my attention starved ego. I hope the view count hits 1000.  Thanks everyone! See ya Dennison. (watch your back)"

That may have been the fish we saw on your wrist......................................   Well DSN located it, I think?
