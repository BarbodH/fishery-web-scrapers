Was just wondering if anyone could recommend a place, does bay of quinte even have ice bungalows. Not looking for anything guided. Thanks in advance"
832121,Sinker,2014-01-23 00:23:00,8692,"No bungalows that I know of, but sunset cove has decent cabins and hut rentals for a fair price. Ive never stayed there, but they are in a good location, and the ice is good where they are right now too.  They come up on google.  S."
832122,bassmaster4,2014-01-23 00:29:00,801,"Thanks, looked on Google and the only thing that comes up is sunset farms I saw they had cabins so it might be the same thing. If not could you post me the link please. Thanks"

832151,Stoty,2014-01-23 05:23:00,2910,"Lots of hotels around the Bay with some being super cheap and close to the water. Try Twin Peaks in Napanee... I stay there all the time. Cheap and close to Deseronto/Napanee area to fish.  Also, if you're looking to go with a guide, def look up Joe from PB&J charters. http://www.pbandjcharters.com/"
