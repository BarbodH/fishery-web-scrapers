831685,Canuck2fan,2014-01-20 22:28:00,1444,"Heard of both cold calling and offering to buy a quality vehicle from a trusted customer, due to the high demand....  The only thing new in car sales is how people say I got the greatest deal because I did my research, bought a service from the net that told me exactly what the stealership pays for what I bought. Then I sat down in front of the computer and saw it was all true yadda yadda yadda. Really glad you are all happy.  Then to get the real story, go drinking with those salesmen/owners that Friday night and you will hear, about the special program the money guy has whipped up to show only our special ""favourite"" clients the cost of the vehicle they want you to see. Then how the factory had this incredible incentive on top of everything so they could have went lower, but that car cost service didn't have this weeks incentives on it yet. Lastly how they brag then I got the guy to buy the special windshield wiper blade warranty for only 100.00, that cash went straight in to the beer fund, cause it costs us nothing the factory pays for them for the warranty period as long as you say they were streaking the glass and so on. It is still a fun game though if you like to haggle.  My new telemarketer answer is simple.  I calmly ask them to just hold on a second while I get a pen I want to get your name right and your supervisors, so when I have you charged under the do not call law I want to be sure it is YOU, YOURSELF that gets to pay the fine!!! I already have your phone number and why you called recorded here so I just need your name, again, it wouldn't be fair if your colleague got charged instead of you....  It is amazing how fast they hang up."
831755,jjcanoe,2014-01-21 04:43:00,744,"This tactic has been working great for me lately, in fact, I have not received a telemarketers call since before Christmas. When you see ""unknown caller"" or any number you don't recognize come up on your display, pick up the phone and answer it in your most official voice with ""RCMP telephone fraud division, how can I help you?"" The next sound you will hear is a click or a beep as the person on the other end hangs up the phone as quick as they can to avoid the call being traced.  Then they take your number off their list, and it seems they might be passing the info around since  I went from almost a call or more a day to nothing!  Unfortunately it does not work for the ""congratulations you've won a free cruise"" or any other robo-calls....."

What a joke.  I'm on the list and I still get just as many telemarketing calls as I did before."
831873,lew,2014-01-21 20:31:00,12766,"When we 1st got married 47+ years ago we lived on the 4th floor of a Scarboro apartment building with NO elevators.  Not long after moving in an encyclopedia salesman somehow got my phone number and started calling me about buying some of his books. He called every night even though I told him I wasn't interested. After a week or so I was totally fed up with this guy and told him I'd changed my mind and now wanted to buy a set of his books and would he come over and bring everything he had including bookcases.  Never told him it was 4 floors with no elevator....  He arrived and started hauling six full sets of encyclopedias up the stairs plus a couple book stands and after he finished and was trying to catch his breath, I told him I had changed my mind again and no longer wanted them.  He hauled all his stuff back down the 4 flights of stairs, loaded everything in his car and left in a huff and never bothered me again.  Nasty on my part perhaps, but he wouldn't take NO for an answer."
831877,lookinforwalleye,2014-01-21 20:42:00,4399,The plight of the salesmen....no respect!!!
831887,Old Ironmaker,2014-01-21 21:37:00,8243,"The Ontario Gov do not call list is a law that has no teeth. Telemarketer managers think it's a joke. My brother manages one of these offices for a national company. There has never been a charge laid by the Crown for calling someone on the list I'm told, it's a joke.  I go into one of my many accents and confuse and frustrate the caller to no end until they hang up, then they put me on their do not waste your time with this guy list. Brother says they have one. No need to look at the incoming number, if I have to say hello more than once you know that their system identifies a connected call, routes it to a telemarketer that takes a few seconds before they say hello.  If you are in the phone book, use your initials for first name, when they ask for Mr. J.A. Doe you know it's right from the phone book.  Never enter a draw for a free new car, vacation or the like. They make the money selling entrants info to telemarketers. The telemarketers with the largest data base on the ones hired as subcontractors.  Just remember before you are very rude, these people are working crazy hours at minimum wage without benefits to earn a living. Off shore telemarketer are paid pennies. For those in Canada, and the trend is to bring these jobs back from Asia, they are not drawing social assistance, usually, and are paying taxes. As I said before not the greatest way to earn a living but at least they are working.  Not everyone has the means or ability to get a post secondary education, with manufacturing jobs going to those with University degrees this, and fast food is about all that's left."
830661,Headhunter,2014-01-15 14:49:00,5703,"So, like many here, I get those annoying telemarketing calls from folks who think I need my duct work cleaned, my water tested or an up-grade on my windows and doors. I usually just hang up and carry on with my day, but yesterday, I got a much different one... I got a call from a sales associate at a Chrysler dealership, letting me know about the newest offerings for Chrysler! Frankly, I was caught of guard. I have never been cold called by a car dealership before and I really didn't get how they had my name and phone number. I have never stepped foot on a Chrysler dealership! Truth be told, I wouldn't be caught dead in one of their vehicles. I told the guy basically that... he seemed somewhat put off by my comments!LOL Has this happened to anyone else? Is the car industry really that competitve that they are now cold calling people in an effort to sell their stuff? Just thought I's throw this out there! HH"
830663,ccmtcanada,2014-01-15 15:03:00,7971,"I've never been called by a car dealership before!!  But sometimes after hearing their sales pitch, I'll say ""Hey look...I have this great fridge....it's energy star rated, white, 18 cubic feet and fully adjustable shelves.  Freezer up top and can even make ice for you!  Are you interested?  It's a steal for $200"".....and then not even acknowledge any products or services they quoted to me....  Sometimes they hang up....sometimes they are stunned in silence....most of the times I say ""didn't think so....neither am I""."
830668,DanD,2014-01-15 15:28:00,2223,"That likely wouldn’t be Chrysler itself doing this; but either a dealer’s in-house program or a very aggressive sales person, fishing for business. As for telemarketers; I usually ask them to hold and then set the receiver down on the table. When I hear the hang up tone, I hang up the receiver. I’ve had some idiots sit there waiting for 15 or more minutes. LOL  Dan."
830670,bass_man,2014-01-15 15:32:00,43,"Not a cold call but something even stupider.  Back in the early 70s I took a sales job with a new car dealership. I thought everything was going well with the training program until the trainer told us about the ""paper bag"" trick. We were expected to tear paper bags into strips and wright on them Call me right away it's about your car we were then to go to all malls and put these on the windshield of all 5 year old models of our dealership's cars.  When the owner of the car franticly called to find out what had happened to his car we would have an opportunity to try to sell him a new car.  I was assured that this was a normal process and that we absolutely had to do it to be considered good salesman prospects.  I refused to take part in this stupidity so this was the end of my stint as a new car salesman."
830671,Headhunter,2014-01-15 15:37:00,5703,  That's what I found most curious! HH
830683,Freshtrax,2014-01-15 16:34:00,2215,I bet the dude gets an extra sale a month because  he picks up the phone when it's not busy.    Seems smart to me.
830688,bobogo,2014-01-15 16:45:00,76,"Cold calls from the dealership itself is a surprise! I wonder if they're going to go back to 90's sales tactics are bring their cars door to door asking you to test drive it on the spot. haha  i wouldn't pick on or hassle the employee making the calls. They're just doing their job to put food on their table. Pretty sure those are minimum wage jobs too. Sure, it's annoying as heck, and I want to annoy them back, but if you take a step in their shoes, they don't want to call you either, they're paid to by the higher ups.  I just say i'm not interested and if they keep pressuring I hang up."
830690,Headhunter,2014-01-15 16:47:00,5703,"Oh, I get cold calling, been doing target cold calling myself for the better part of 30 years! I was just suprised by this is all! HH"
830702,ketchenany,2014-01-15 17:48:00,3229,I just tell them to hang on while I get paper and a pen to jot down the information and just keep eating.

They wanted to know if they could buy my van as it is very popular and there are not very many on the market right now (so she said).  Didn't really try to sell me anything, just wanted to buy my van.  I thought that was weird."
830753,Old Ironmaker,2014-01-15 21:13:00,8243,They're just trying to make a living. Not the greatest job in the world granted. Better than some of the alternative ways to get money.

Reminds me of a response that I read about for the ones who claim to be from Microsoft or from the ""Computer Technical Department""  claiming that my computer is sending out a virus.  I usually just hang up on them.  I read about one guy who tells them that he set is computer up that way on purpose.  Unfortunately I haven't received a call lately so I haven't been able to use that line yet."

They can make a trade in offer sound pretty good even getting you better than blue book but in the end you either get a poor trade in and a good price on the new van or great trade in and a poor deal on the new. I thankfully have the system beat I am the plumber for the ford dealership and when I buy a car I sit in front of the computer of the owner and see what they have exactly in a vehicle including kick backs and we come to a fair price.

830847,irishfield,2014-01-16 01:30:00,26272,We do the same thing here Art... on my last truck the dealer made exactly $69 and I know that for fact. They make money servicing these days at $92.50/hr.. not selling. Want to get a salesman excited.. .tell him that their service department sucks and you won't be buying a new vehicle from him unless he changes dealerships.
830851,John,2014-01-16 01:46:00,2956,Not a new concept in the auto business Joe. Used to make about 50 cold calls a week in the 70's and even knocked on doors. Translated into about 1 sale a week for me. Those were the days when dealers made money on sales and service revenue was ancilliary.
