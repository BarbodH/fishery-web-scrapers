832385,ccmtcanada,2014-01-24 16:51:00,7971,They need that third eye to watch out for nets????  UGLY!!!
832386,Governator,2014-01-24 16:52:00,879,EEEEkk... glad I viewed that just BEFORE I opened my lunch.
832388,davey buoy,2014-01-24 16:55:00,5505,"Little disturbing,wonder what is causing it??"
832392,jedimaster,2014-01-24 17:13:00,3472,"Grosss. We caught an 8 pound Walleye on Bay of quinte last week covered in tumors, like at least 20 of them."

832395,fishnsled,2014-01-24 17:21:00,3520,Wonder how it tasted?  LOL!  Adapting to the surroundings and survival...nets don't stand a chance.
832398,captpierre,2014-01-24 17:34:00,2521,Birth defect.  Could be just accidental or caused by something in the environment  More than average defects would raise concerns
832402,wallyboss,2014-01-24 17:50:00,1095,"Looks like a periscope, to keep an eye on the fisherman."
832404,Nipfisher,2014-01-24 18:12:00,2449,Pickereyes!  That is the Pickerel / Walleye hybrid.
832405,agoertzen,2014-01-24 18:13:00,23,"this year its 3 eyes, next year maybe 4 to become the ultimate predator?"

832407,jedimaster,2014-01-24 18:41:00,3472,yup looked like it was covered in bloody popcorn
832418,SirCranksalot,2014-01-24 19:34:00,3291,"The saving grace is that it's probably too ugly to breed. It'll get rejected in favor of other good looking walleyes---yeah, good luck on finding those!!"
832420,Joey,2014-01-24 19:57:00,9122,"Wow, that's not what I was expecting to see!!!  He's beautiful in his own way, be nice"
832423,Joey,2014-01-24 20:03:00,9122,
832427,kickingfrog,2014-01-24 20:13:00,8333,Happens all the time in nature. These growths are different then tumours. Many of these are never witnessed by us because they are easier pickings for predators….
832428,kickingfrog,2014-01-24 20:14:00,8333,…Some grow up to be sens fans.
832430,irishfield,2014-01-24 20:41:00,26272,Just imagine the extra cheek fillet on that one...

832434,Roy,2014-01-24 20:56:00,13728,Just imagine the extra cheek fillet on that one...  Almost as good as horse meat.
832435,aplumma,2014-01-24 20:57:00,6896,Glad the walleyes arn't that ugly.   Art
832438,highdrifter,2014-01-24 21:06:00,2534,"Reminds me of Blinkey..  Mr. Burns:  Let's ask an actor portraying Charles Darwin.Charles:  Hello.Mr. Burns:  Hello, Charles.  Tell them about your theory of natural selection.Charles:  Glad to.  Every so often, Mother Nature changes her animals giving them bigger teeth, sharper claws, longer legs or in this case, a third eye.If these changes are an improvement the new animals thrive and multiply and spread across the earth.Mr. Burns:  So this fish might have an advantage over other fish.Charles:  It may be a kind of super-fish.Mr. Burns:  I wouldn't mind a third eye, would you? Charles:  No.Mr. Burns:  You see, friends if our antinuclear naysayers and choose-upsiders came upon an elephant next to our power plant they'd probably blame his ridiculous nose on the nuclear bogeyman.  Some food for thought right there!!"
832498,Sharkbait22,2014-01-25 00:53:00,297,The Simpsons Blinky does come to mind.  Instead of walleye he's a trieye.  Seriously. It could be a stocked hatchery fish: many live that shouldn't. The ones out of BOQ have always scared me - too many tumours.
