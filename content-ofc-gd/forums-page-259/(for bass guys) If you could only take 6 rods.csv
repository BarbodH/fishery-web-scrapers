831528,spinnerbaitking,2014-01-19 23:08:00,1622,"If I could be fishing for SM & LM I likely won't be in my boat with less than 10 or 12 rods, I could have 2 or 3 different Dropshot & Tube rods or 3 or 4 Flipp'n rods Jig &/or Texas Rigs, I like lots of techniques tied on for quick changes, a couple lake that have nice Smallies on I could have 2 Tubes, 2 Drop Shot, 3 Crankbait, a Spinnerbait or 2 & a Jerkbait maybe a Swimbait rod too.

(it's an evil disease, lol).  guys with real boats have 16 plus setups at any one time sitting on sexy rocket launchers.  tackle porn"

831251,Fang,2014-01-18 22:08:00,1330,"More rig set up as rod length and power does change for me depending on the actual lake My flipping system is totally different for say Scugog versus up north  This is for ugly/weedy water  Flipping rod with jig/craw combo Heavy worm rod for punching mats Pitching combo with worm/plastic baits Frog rod 2 multiple purpose MH/M that I can cast anything with ( spinnerbaits, buzz bait, cranks, jerks) Never go out without a MH spinning set up I use for slugo/big seniors  So I need 7 not six. Most tourneys I had 9 systems but that would include at least 1 back up flipping that only gets used if something breaks and most times that would be the frog rod.  If its smallies and clear water better plan for 6 completely different set ups. Biggest tourney weights over the last 5 years are almost 100% smallmouth. Light line and finesse style - tubes, swim baits, jigging spoons, jerk baits/spinnerbaits, top water"

831404,Garry2Rs,2014-01-19 06:20:00,1425,I know that my casting accuracy drops off as my rod length passes six feet.  I also believe that an accurate short cast catches more fish than any 100 foot Hail-Mary.  Therefore my rods will be shorter than most.

831413,Toddyc20,2014-01-19 13:04:00,141,I think it's fantastic seeing all these different bass anglers and how different everyone's answers are. I guess it's all about comfort/confidence.  Thanks to everyone that has posted so far. I look forward to reading more.
831417,MCTFisher9120,2014-01-19 13:42:00,3761,"6 rods is a good amount to deal with on any particular day bassin. I own around 10 or 11 but 4 or 5 is usually what I bring after figuring out the patterns on the fishing trips.  Casting 1)7'5 Ex-Heavy Ex-Fast NRX/Core 100Mg7 (60lb Braid) Frogging (Faster Tip helps launch frogs a mile casting accuracy is always super)  2)7'5 Heavy Fast GLX/Core 100MgFV (60lb Braid) Punching/Flipping plastics through the cover 3/4oz-1.5oz  3)7'3 Med-Heavy Fast NRX/Core 50Mg7 (22lb Fluoro) Pitching texas rigged plastics 3/8oz-3/4oz  4)7'6 Med-Heavy Mod-Fast CBR906 Loomis/Calcutta TE100DC (12lb Fluoro) All around cranking (If there not smacking frogs or are not on the pitch/flip bite cranking under the hot sun or cold front days works for me)  Spinning 5)7'1 Medium X-Fast NRX/CI4+2500FA (12lb Braid) Soft Tube Jigs/5"" Wacky Sick Stick (covers some finesse techniques)  6)6'8 Medium X-Fast NRX/CI4+1000FA (10lb Braid) (Topwater Popper/Shaky Head/Drop Shot/Soft Jerkbait)  Being a heavy cover angler I need those top 3 with the aid of cranking and spinning gear. I quite often walk to that boat with 2 or 3 rods some days when you know the flip/frog bite is all you need but it never hurts to have other options at the ready. I remember many afternoons looking at a 14' Diving crank and picking it up turning my back to a slop mat and working deeper structure. When the tools are at the ready it will help you become a much more efficient angler.  Good thread guys!"

It should be noted that I fish smallies a couple times a year, the rest is largies.  those rods do double duty for light rigger rods (both 7'6"" 'lighter' rods)."
