831603,BillM,2014-01-20 15:21:00,17367,There's a weird feeling you get after humping a SportsPal through 750M of the thickest bush/deadfall only to be rewarded at the end with bee stings and 10lb walleye     There are parts of it you absolutely hate and parts of it you absolutely love.  In the end (at least for me) I've never regretted a single second of it
831607,Jds63,2014-01-20 15:36:00,1365," Lots of people don't.   I was never in a rush when I did my long extended wilderness trips. I had no shedule and could do whatever it was I felt like.  I've always said only the grossly rich or really poor can do a lengthy trip like that. (I was in the latter category LOL!) For the average person it's impossible to take 2-4 months off and I feel incredibly fortunate that I was able to live this type of lifestyle for a number of years.  On long expeditions every day is a new adventure, as unless you're windbound you're travelling and seeing amazing new sights. Yes there's physical labor involved but it's taken in stride. As you get stronger and stronger you revel in it.  On my solo trips I ate when I was hungry, slept when I was tired, fished whenever I felt like it and answered to no one. Trust me that's a great feeling.  Everything needed was carried on my back - food, clothing, shelter, transportation... It truly hit home at least to me how little one needs in life to be happy.  These trips also changed me as a person profoundly. They instilled such a deep sense of accomplishment in me I realized that I was capable of anything.  I could go on, but I'll stop. This is actually one of my favorite topics and I tend to ramble.   I am glad to have spent a couple of days paddling with ya , ... I need to get to Quetico before I am too old   .... LOL"
831611,mike rousseau,2014-01-20 15:47:00,4661,Talk about a character builder....
831618,Musky or Specks,2014-01-20 16:39:00,2710,"It's about the sense of accomplishment. I'll equate it with the extreme of climbing a mountain. It's physically demanding and involves hardship and its not about relaxation that most equate with vacations. When I'm doing an extended trip with crappy weather, bugs, long overgrown portages I always think why am I doing this??? Then its over and I'm done and all I can think is what an awesome adventure can't wait to do something like it again. I don't do the same trip twice I always want to see strange new places."
831741,Freshtrax,2014-01-21 02:49:00,2215,I would love to do something like that...minus the bugs   I've spent many a week on the lower French and the Wanipite  but nothing that crazy
831805,Joey,2014-01-21 15:33:00,9122,"I found the one part where the guys summed up the trip very enlightening.  This is what he said, and it rings true to life in general.  Quote:  ""You need to work hard every day and you're not going to come out to a big answer, or THE answer, you're just going to find yourself at a new spot a little further down the river.  You're going to be a little stronger, you're going to grow with the people around you and you're going to wake up the next day and you're going to do it again.""

831832,wallacio,2014-01-21 17:44:00,475,Looks like an amazing trip.   The one Hipster looked a bit out of his element though...you might want to leave the skinny jeans and Wayfarers at home for the next canoe trip.   Must have been tough in the bush without his no-fat Hazelnut Macchiatos LOL!
831840,BillM,2014-01-21 18:04:00,17367,I think those guys might have been stoned the entire time.
831924,Whopper,2014-01-21 23:35:00,2174,Pretty neat deal. I know this was condensed but these guys seemed to be behind the eight ball most of the time to make it to their destination. I would love to do something similar only not as long distance with a lot more rec time.
832073,pidge,2014-01-22 21:01:00,438,Just watched the whole vid. Pretty awesome trip I'd say. Thanks for sharing and thanks for the fellows that actually did it.

832093,chris.brock,2014-01-22 22:06:00,4053,"it's easier to carry the ""Peace Pipe"" over the portages than cases of beer, these guys are just trying to be practical I guess"

832199,NAW,2014-01-23 15:10:00,4022,"I only got to watch a snippet.  But I really liked what I saw.  Very cool video.  I used to live in Pickle Lake back in the day.  One day i would like to go back for a few weeks to explore, and get back to my roots.  Maybe paddle some of the same rivers.  I still have an old mesh back cap from the ""Pickle Lake Black Fly Festival"".   And a few mugs from the ""Pickle Lake Ice Worm Festival""... Crazy place to call home.  Those guys are a great inspiration.  Thanks for posting   .  I can't wait to watch the entire video."
831303,Musky or Specks,2014-01-19 00:58:00,2710,  They hit one of my dream rivers the Fawn. These guys are hardcore

831333,Tim Mills,2014-01-19 02:47:00,476,A different level of canoe trip.  These guys really took a beating.
831343,solopaddler,2014-01-19 02:59:00,8605,"Brad thank's so much for posting this!  I paddled the Fawn solo as part of lengthy expedition, although the difference in my case was I navigated the river upstream. One of my favorite all time trips.  On that same trip I also paddled the entire length of the Asheweig, another very similar river with the same quality of trout fishing.  This coming summer after a 20 year absence I'll be returning to the Asheweig. I cannot wait!"

831411,solopaddler,2014-01-19 12:58:00,8605," July should be fun  It will. I think I'm looking forward to this trip even more than the Sutton. Still, it's a far cry from a 30-60 day canoe trip.  Bill and I will be travelling and fishing on the Asheweig with the Oji-Cree of the Kasabonika Lake First Nations. I'll be documenting the trip and Bill will be taking photos."

Bought a new solo canoe.  http://www.oldtowncanoe.com/canoes/recreational/pack/  Mike did you ever use a kayak paddle for soloing or were you strictly a one blade guy?Trying to decide which way to go.

When I informed my doctor of my plans for all this soloing she asked me how I felt about if I had a heart attack and died in the bush. I told her that would be beautiful. That is a way I would chose to go.

That is a way I would chose to go.  Most of my solo trips involved both flatwater and some serious river running and I always had two standard straight shaft paddles with me. I'm waaay more comfortable using that style than anything else.  On one trip to Quetico which was all flatwater I used a bent shaft paddle and loved it.
