THANKS Buddy we did not  catch your name, but for sure was nice to meet you."
831419,leaf4,2014-01-19 13:54:00,2466,great to hear and glad to see you got into some fish!
831424,davey buoy,2014-01-19 14:05:00,5505,"Well there you go!,still lots of nice people around.I would of done the same as I'm sure you would.  ."
831426,Handlebarz,2014-01-19 14:16:00,3790,That is awesome to here glad it worked out for you. I was always that way and some times it hurts as I don't like to lend my lazer auger some people don't know who to use a auger so I would help but have to drill there holes myself. Now with the jiffy its a breeze.
831432,SirCranksalot,2014-01-19 14:30:00,3291,"Well there you go!,still lots of nice people around.I would of done the same as I'm sure you would.  .  I know we all hear stories about the inconsiderate---er, let's just say  'hosers'--- out there but my experience says that most fisher folk are helpful, generous and have all sorts of good qualities. As J Cash sung ---bad news travels like wildfire, good news travels slow."
831438,Roy,2014-01-19 14:53:00,13728,"Good news indeed, Rodelu. Super that the fellow helped you out and that you and the boys got into some fish. It's hard to imagine someone flatly refusing to help out though. Glad it all worked out."
831450,NAW,2014-01-19 16:04:00,4022,"Yep, most are willing to help if you ask politely.  I once saw a group who couldn't get their auger started.  Way out on the far side of long shoal. Then seen buddy a few hundred yards away fire up his sled and shoot over with his power auger and bust some holes for them."
831453,Rod Caster,2014-01-19 16:13:00,5784,Sure makes it feel like a community when people do nice deeds like that. Good stuff.
831454,manitoubass2,2014-01-19 16:17:00,11391,"Thats a great story! Glad it worked out for ya. Next month, ill be drilling 3-400 holes for others lol"

831510,Rich,2014-01-19 21:41:00,3927,"Great stuff! I'm always willing to drill a hole for somebody in a similar bind, because I have also been in a similar bind before!"

831725,chris.brock,2014-01-21 01:41:00,4053,"when I'm up north or in outdoor situations, people seem friendlier and conversations are better     funny, I was sledding to my hut this weekend, some walk on guys were packed up and ready to head off the lake, they were walking while towing a portable hut and sleigh with all their gear through a foot of snow, I stopped about 200 yds away, thinking ""should I go over and offer to tow their stuff in and give them a ride in?"" I really wanted to help, I'm not in a hurry. I just continued towards my hut. Why- because I thought they would think I was trying to steal stuff (I guess I've spent too much time in the city???)  good story Rodelu"
