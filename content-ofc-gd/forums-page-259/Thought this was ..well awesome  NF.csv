831625,Bill Shearer,2014-01-20 18:26:00,456,That guy was very lucky!
831626,solopaddler,2014-01-20 18:37:00,8605,Can't believe he sat there for so long . Animals are unpredictable....        
831627,TJQ,2014-01-20 18:43:00,7806,Those antlers look awful sharp id say... not sure what id rather have a donkey or a elk... lolol
831633,leaf4,2014-01-20 19:17:00,2466,"wow that video was hilarious, why were his pants down? hahahaha"
831634,solopaddler,2014-01-20 19:21:00,8605,"wow that video was hilarious, why were his pants down? hahahaha  The original video which I couldn't find he was taking a leak in the field when the burro attacked him."
831636,ketchenany,2014-01-20 19:31:00,3229,"If you 're hungry take the elk, if your travelling take the donkey!"
831639,ccmtcanada,2014-01-20 19:56:00,7971,When he got up and walked to the car the poor elk looked like he just lost a friend!!  Amazing footage!
831643,Joey,2014-01-20 20:12:00,9122,I believe that elk was later put down
831653,solopaddler,2014-01-20 20:45:00,8605,I believe that elk was later put down  And the burro relaxed with a smoke and a drink after his encounter.     
831661,bare foot wader,2014-01-20 20:55:00,1354,"I have a different viewpoint on this...I think that photographer should have received a stiff fine, no different than feeding bears in a park, he is habituating a wild animal with human interaction and when that happens the animal always loses  if he wants to photograph wild animals, go for it  if he wants to interact and get super up close to an animal, go to a zoo"
831683,aplumma,2014-01-20 22:22:00,6896,I know that the goats do this all of the time to their friends. They will spar like this when they are in a friendly mood. Ruddy was a over 7ft tall when he reared up and he would come down and bump your hand with his head as gently as he could. He would then huff and snort and capper around and line up for the next blow. He has passed on but he was one of my favorite buds who lived outside.   Art
831691,Canuck2fan,2014-01-20 22:45:00,1444,"I agree from the footage it looks like he should not have been in that situation but what we don't know is just how far the elk was from him when it decided to come over and check him out?  He definitely seemed like he knew he wouldn't get hurt if he just stayed calm and non threatening. Wonder what would have happened if he got up and bolted, might have ended badly with a prong in the back and a stomping as well after."
831701,Christopheraaron,2014-01-20 23:37:00,3525,I believe that elk was later put down Yes it was.
831753,captpierre,2014-01-21 04:12:00,2521,Smokey Mountains?  Wonder what he was smokin'.  Could easily have lost an eye or worse.
