831946,Sinker,2014-01-22 00:48:00,8692,Dropshot
831947,BillM,2014-01-22 00:53:00,17367,Dropshot  Bingo.
831980,chris.brock,2014-01-22 03:20:00,4053,"Wouldn't a tip-up with a single hook and minnow below a split shot be more natural and sensitive to bites rather than a dropshot set up?  I can see the advantages of dropshotting from a drifting boat, but ice fishing you're not moving at all and totally vertical  never tried it, just curious"
832066,Sinker,2014-01-22 19:47:00,8692,"Works best under a slip float IMO. There is nothing more sensitive. Best when in a hut, but if you maintain a slip float outside, its a very effective way to catch fish on minnows.  A willow gad with a spool of line, hook and sinker will catch just as many fish.  S."
832080,misfish,2014-01-22 21:12:00,29133,  Now yer just talking crazy Shane.  Thats my fav set up for late ice pike.
832104,Sinker,2014-01-22 22:56:00,8692,"I still use it for specks and splake. Best set up going, and fits in my pocket for the long snowshoe in"
831464,redpearl99,2014-01-19 17:31:00,259,just wondering what size minnows I should be using for whitefish and lake trout while ice fishing at simcoe.  I went for the first time this week but I thought my minnows might have been too big for whitefish... some where about 4-5 inch shinners
831469,misfish,2014-01-19 17:45:00,29133,"I dont use live bait. Jigs and body baits. Plastic and hard.  So on with your question.  Are you using a spreader for the whities? 4-5 inch shiners are good for lakers.  As for the spreader,use 2 inch shiners. Hook them in the tail. They will stay active. Trying to swim up."
831474,DRIFTER_016,2014-01-19 18:17:00,10439,"4-5 inch is not too big for lakers. I have used dead baits to 20"" for big lakers and have caught 20# fish on that sized bait. As for whities 2-2 1/2"" shiners as mentioned. I use 3"" frozen smelt (no live bait allowed here) and have even used them tipped on a jig and caught whities."
831475,wallacio,2014-01-19 18:21:00,475,"^ yup.   You can't go too big for Lakers!  I use 4-5"" shiners for Lakers routinely and Whitefish will hit them as well if they are aggressive.  If not, then downsize as stated.   Now cue up the next 20+ posts stating that you don't *need* minnows..."
831477,misfish,2014-01-19 18:31:00,29133,    I do miss the tip up days. Stick facing down and then the slow rise. Hand over hand retrieve.
831495,BillM,2014-01-19 20:07:00,17367,4-5inch emeralds are perfect for both lakers/whities.
831526,redpearl99,2014-01-19 23:06:00,259,what's a spreader
831537,Fisherman,2014-01-19 23:32:00,7201,Like one of these: https://www.google.ca/search?q=ice+fishing+spreader&client=firefox-a&hs=78N&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&channel=fflb&tbm=isch&tbo=u&source=univ&sa=X&ei=ZmDcUs7CA-y_sQTNjYG4Aw&ved=0CCsQsAQ&biw=955&bih=714
831581,camillj,2014-01-20 12:21:00,1988,Spreader ................................................. sorry couldnt resist ... better gets me another coffee
831641,davey buoy,2014-01-20 20:08:00,5505,"So stay with the 4-5"" emerald shiners,how would you hook them and would you weigh them down with a weight a foot or so above them?.were talking deep water.sorry to side track"
831642,Terry,2014-01-20 20:10:00,14456,"I would use a spreader, they are weighted  and tail hook them"
831645,davey buoy,2014-01-20 20:23:00,5505,"I would use a spreader, they are weighted  and tail hook them Thanks Terry,tail hooked sounds good.Would you say best on a tip up?,I was thinking jigging in the hut.They are pretty big shiners.I have both systems ready to go.Trying to keep the perch away for a couple outings .In the hut is that what you would use ?. Thanks."
831647,Terry,2014-01-20 20:27:00,14456,if/when I use minnows  a tip up with spreader is what I would use  then if there is room for a second line  I would jig  if it is a 2 hook spreader you cam put a hook 5 ft above on the line and another minnow
831648,davey buoy,2014-01-20 20:30:00,5505,"if/when I use minnows  a tip up with spreader is what I would use  then if there is room for a second line  I would jig  if it is a 2 hook spreader you cam put a hook 5 ft above on the line and another minnow Thanks ,will give it a try."
831666,misfish,2014-01-20 21:17:00,29133,"The ones in the first pic,of the link from FM,are the best IMO spreader you can buy. Hooks stable and facing up. Hook sets are deadly."

831681,misfish,2014-01-20 22:20:00,29133,Open at 6. Has coffee and sandwiches now. It was nice to come off the lake yesterday and stop in for a cup of brew and chat. His ole man is a hoot.

831689,misfish,2014-01-20 22:39:00,29133," Almost forgot about that bud.  A large 4-5 inch shiner,would lift the spreader making more action at times.  Traveling with minnows in a portable,is a pain though."

Traveling with minnows in a portable,is a pain though. That's where the tip ups come in.More of a lure /maybe tipped with a small minnow in the hut.Thanks guys"
831742,Sinker,2014-01-21 02:53:00,8692,I prefer a slip float to a tip up all day long.Just sayin...  s.
831750,Freshtrax,2014-01-21 03:52:00,2215, Just watch that top hook when a big fish takes a last min. Run while hand lining.
