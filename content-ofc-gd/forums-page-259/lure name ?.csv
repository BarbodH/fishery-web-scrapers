831711,NewHips,2014-01-21 00:46:00,111,"I've been racking my brain to figure out the name & manufacturer of this lure.I'm sure had a treble hook on the back end, hard plastic and a S curved body. I thought it was a Rapala injured minnow?Help !!!!!!!!!! "
831713,Christopheraaron,2014-01-21 00:50:00,3525,"Hmm, doesn't look like a rapala paint job to me."
831714,solopaddler,2014-01-21 00:50:00,8605,That's a Rapala Minnow Spoon. They came in both a single hook weedless version and yours which had a treble.  I've still got a bunch of the weedless ones and use them all the time. Great lures!
831715,Roy,2014-01-21 00:52:00,13728,Yup....they work well. I only have the treble models.
831716,NewHips,2014-01-21 00:54:00,111,"That's a Rapala Minnow Spoon. They came in both a single hook weedless version and yours which had a treble.  I've still got a bunch of the weedless ones and use them all the time. Great lures! Mike, this is what I was using on Beteau.........single hook with a 5in white double tail. It got most of my big fish all week. Thanks........I'm sure that is it."
831717,Steve,2014-01-21 00:54:00,2075,old school.  haven't seen one of those in quite some time...
831718,Christopheraaron,2014-01-21 01:04:00,3525,Guess I was wrong!
831720,solopaddler,2014-01-21 01:13:00,8605,"Mike, this is what I was using on Beteau.........single hook with a 5in white double tail. It got most of my big fish all week. Thanks........I'm sure that is it.  I'm really careful with the ones I have left, they work! I've got a couple of fire tiger weedless versions that are lethal.  As an aside I always tip my weedless spoons as well when fishing for pike. For future trips try these oversized salt water pork ripple tails. They're super tough and last forever and they add scent and texture that the fish seem to love. The white and red colors are deadly.      "
831724,Fang,2014-01-21 01:39:00,1330,"Still guys selling that body with trebles and weed less on eBay See them once in a while, not too often though. They don't call them rapalas so somebody must be copying the original out of china. I've got several big gold weed less ones still. Great pike lure"
831791,bare foot wader,2014-01-21 14:39:00,1354,"great lure, tipped with a pork lizard one of my favourite lures for pike....I have a personal stash, still new in the box, I've even repainted my old ones, they are harder to find these days"
831792,BillM,2014-01-21 14:51:00,17367,All you need for big snakes are Johnson Silver minnows with a big Kalins 5in grub on the back (Super glue it  )
831806,Acountdeleted,2014-01-21 15:49:00,2562,I remember the weedless ones of those when they came out. The pikes love em.
