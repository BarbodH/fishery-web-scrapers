832090,chris.brock,2014-01-22 21:45:00,4053,"Nice find! A person could make a fortune reselling them  nah, not much margin there  hot rapalas usually go for about $5, not that I would know or anything"

832182,gordy28,2014-01-23 14:36:00,638,At the CT at Meadowvale town centre rapalas werent on sale but they had a basket of assorted Storm baits for $3.5 They actually had a bunch of wiggle warts which has been an amazing smallie crank for me  - typically hard to find in Canada (I had ordered mine from Cabelas in the past)
832202,Tim Mills,2014-01-23 15:46:00,476,Chris- Thx for passing that on. I was in there last week and got some terminal tackle and spoons that were on clearance. The day to day pricing and selection of the CT's  in my area aren't great but they do have some good sales from time to time.
