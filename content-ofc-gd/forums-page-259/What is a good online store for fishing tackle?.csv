825332,Richie Razor,2013-12-20 00:33:00,536,My vote is for The fishin hole. Great prices and cheap shipping
825337,Christopheraaron,2013-12-20 00:42:00,3525,"Last I heard, Etackle scammed a bunch of people. Glad I didnt order from them. I know phil is alive and well, and has a new job, but not sure whats up with the tackle scamming....i mean business.  S. I heard it was just slow shipping"
825346,mosquito,2013-12-20 01:17:00,111,"It just depends on what you are looking for, so what do you need?  You can order directly from alot of the dealers, last time I ordered online I went through the approved lists on the Canadian Made and North American Made facebook pages.  Most of the companies will ship and if you buy directly they sometimes throw in a bonus.  Here is a link to the ""Canadian Made"" https://www.facebook.com/CanadianMadeOutdoorsGear  I thought their link to the Seal skin boots was interesting.... until I saw the price! http://www.furcanada.com/seal-skin.html"
825376,bigugli,2013-12-20 03:34:00,6138,"You have a number of independent makers of custom tackle right here on OFC. Custom makers of rods, flies, streamers, harnesses, spinners, musky baits,..... It all depends on what you are looking for."
