831906,BillM,2014-01-21 22:24:00,17367,I don't know if you and Terry are going to fit into that float tube
831911,bigugli,2014-01-21 22:44:00,6138,I have a couple of great nieces and nephews who want to go fishing with this old grey beard. Guess I'll have to drive them to Orillia and spend my money there.
831914,irishfield,2014-01-21 22:54:00,26272,"Everyone says that Bruce.. and no disrespect or issue your way.. but what do you spend at roads end? Personally if I go to say Innisfil ... I have full tank of gas before I leave. I take my lunch.. I MIGHT stop at Timmies on the way to the parking lot for a donut and OJ, but mostly to leave some liquid behind and use their facilities. I have no issues paying their $10 to park and have a great day on the ice with Terry, Joey and Paul. I take my garbage home and leave no other foot print other than the sled tracks. The township.. rightfully could care less about my $2.45 purchase at Tim's."
831915,Terry,2014-01-21 22:54:00,14456,I don't know if you and Terry are going to fit into that float tube he has been in my lund so many times he has taken ownership of it...well he does have some parts invested in it
831918,lookinforwalleye,2014-01-21 23:11:00,4399,I am guess these parks may have had funding of some kind from a federal or provincial gov.
831920,irishfield,2014-01-21 23:17:00,26272,"True enough LFW, but don't know if centennial park and such did ( I could find out, my buddy is a senior civil engineer for Barrie).. but after the facility is in place it's the daily upkeep that costs the tax payers. We are all witness to what slobs society has become and it takes money to keep it clean and operable. Terry and I launched his boat in Barrie last fall.. the day after some festival that almost had us locked out of the launch... and I counted no less than SIXTY people cleaning the place up. $15 for the day isn't going to change much, other than freeing up a few parking spots."
831921,moxie,2014-01-21 23:28:00,1566,"Incremental, arbitrary and continual increases on a scale I've never witnessed in my lifetime in every facet of our daily lives  . Get used to it folks. There is no money in any kitty and they're taking whats left from you and I. Debt loads are at or approaching  and in some cases have surpassed record levels. It isn't going to get better cause the only social class that used to be able to comfortably afford it is being squeezed out.  Look around at every economy across the globe. The confiscation of whatever wealth is left is picking up steam and barreling towards us all. Suck it up and pay or don't but try doing something more productive than whining about it here where it does absolutely nothing.  Still sending multiple angry e-mails every week in the hopes of hearing a knock at the door and maybe being made an example of with no luck thus far. Guess they figure there aren't enough of us to concern themselves with just yet. At least my hands aren't falling asleep from sitting on them.   Doom and gloom? Tic Toc, Tic Toc............"
831929,misfish,2014-01-21 23:53:00,29133," What,ya think I have been flapping my gums for nothing? It,s the same crap every year. Every weekend they seem to have some kind of fund raiser. get to the launch at 6 am,but dont return til after 2 pm.  I have spilled my beans to them enough. They dont give a rats ass    Im not complaining."
831936,bigugli,2014-01-22 00:18:00,6138,
831938,kickingfrog,2014-01-22 00:28:00,8333,We just moved. We're a literal stone's throw from the Barrie boarder. I can see both sides of this but I do wonder if it turns away some that would spend cash while in town?
831954,Rizzo,2014-01-22 01:16:00,4754,I would say its about time. When I used to live in Barrie I couldn't believe the amount of free parking down by the waterfront. I often thought it was a huge waste of revenue sitting there doing nothing. People will not cancel their trip to the beach over a few bucks to park...they would spend at least $15 more in gas to get to the next decent spot!
831958,Joeytier,2014-01-22 01:28:00,3990,God I'm glad my local lakes are a hundred miles from the nearest parking lot.  Just park on da ice eh!

Oh don't get me going on that bull granola, I don't know how many times I've gotten to the corner of Tiffin and Essa to see the fuzz at the corner doing TC,  sorry can't go to the boat launch.   Why don't they run up the middle of Bayfield St or down the 400 on Monday morning."
831962,BillM,2014-01-22 01:45:00,17367,God I'm glad my local lakes are a hundred miles from the nearest parking lot.  Just park on da ice eh!  There will be lots of parking on Simcoe this weekend I'm sure
831963,crappieperchhunter,2014-01-22 01:56:00,2582,"We usually drop a 100 every time I'm up to Orillia on one of my 16 hour day trips. Brekkie, dinner, and top up the tank. Heck of a lot more if the Mrs hits Rama. But I will not subsidize any town council. Just the same as NOTL with there resident only fishing permit. I won't spend a dime in that municipality. You and I are cut from the same cloth Bruce. Sibbald Point PP used to be my favorite winter perching spot. Have been twice in all the years since they started charging for parking. Same goes for IBP although I never went there as much because it is a farther trek.  Yes I can afford the pittance they charge. I'm just pig headed enough not to spend it. Lotsa other spots to go wet a line."
831811,kickingfrog,2014-01-21 16:23:00,8333,Barrie council decided to charge out of towners to park at the waterfront. $3/hr or $15 for the day. City of Barrie residents will recive some type of pass. Not sure when this starts but it likely will be up and running by summer if not sooner.
831813,misfish,2014-01-21 16:36:00,29133,3 bucks an hour is just rude. Atleast  IBP only charges $1 an hour. $10 max.
831814,Fisherman,2014-01-21 16:36:00,7201,Pretty soon you'll have to pay to park in your own driveway.
831815,misfish,2014-01-21 16:37:00,29133,Also add that they raised the land tax. 2.2%
831822,Ralph Field,2014-01-21 17:15:00,1018,I guess Barrie needs the extra funds !

831830,aplumma,2014-01-21 17:41:00,6896,Pretty soon you'll have to pay to park in your own driveway. Actually you do pay to park in your own driveway with the property taxes.   Art
831835,Pikeslayer,2014-01-21 17:58:00,1443,Welcome to Barrie. Visitors Not Welcome.
831836,bigugli,2014-01-21 17:59:00,6138,Sure makes me feel welcome
831837,BillM,2014-01-21 18:00:00,17367,"Bad idea if you ask me, especially down at the waterfront.   Wanna charge people parking on Dunlop?  Fine..."
831847,Mike Pike,2014-01-21 18:33:00,1332,"So little parking around Simcoe and what there is you have to pay for if you're an out-of-towner.  Nothing says 'Welcome' like that.  Parking has really become an issue on Simcoe come ice fishing time, unless you don't mind driving out onto the lake to park.  Rather than deal with the hassle, I discoveried the great winter fishing available on the Niagara year round.  So now, the Niagara region gets the most of my time( and money )over the winter."
831856,lookinforwalleye,2014-01-21 19:17:00,4399,They should just put a big sign on the 400....visitors are not welcome!!!
831857,Terry,2014-01-21 19:21:00,14456,"I am now  looking for a Barrie family to adopt me, or just one of those parking passes then I wouldn't need to move in....thanks in advance  lol"
831864,davey buoy,2014-01-21 19:42:00,5505,Barrie is only going to hurt themselves.People will seek other lakes.There goes your tourist $$$$$.Pretty sad if you ask me .
831868,ketchenany,2014-01-21 20:18:00,3229,Nothing like fees to kill the tourist/visitor industry.
831871,Pikeslayer,2014-01-21 20:26:00,1443,
831874,Terry,2014-01-21 20:34:00,14456,"that's Innisfil, got that one covered  but now Barrie is the prize"
831879,Handlebarz,2014-01-21 20:54:00,3790,I was thinking the same thing nothing like saying come visit by raising the prices. But then again I don't go there and think there could be good reason for it.  I know that down my way some parks are over run by very large families that will go first thing in the morning gather up almost all tables and just sit there all day then leave their junk around just to do it again the next day. To bad there is not much that can be done for that maybe our area should also make paid parking to keep them away.
831882,Old Ironmaker,2014-01-21 21:08:00,8243,"Pretty soon you'll have to pay to park in your own driveway.  Of course you pay to park in your own driveway. From property taxes to the tag on your vehicle and the comprehensive insurance in case a tree falls on it, don't worry we all pay, nothing free Fisherman.  The idea to charge for parking in a tourist area is contrary to what most all tourist areas do. Voted down putting meters in Dunnville and Port Dover. Actually even suggesting Dunnville is a tourist area is ludicrous, but with the Grand River there someone may stop and visit the new Giant Tiger not the Giant Mudcat. Sorry Fishmaster.  They remove meters to encourage tourism not install them. I wonder what in the hell council is thinking up there."
831884,BillM,2014-01-21 21:19:00,17367,"They are thinking they'd rather get someone else to foot the $814,000 they spend maintaining the lots around Barrie they are letting people park for free in"
831886,irishfield,2014-01-21 21:37:00,26272,"Seems to be the way of the times... either councillors just don't get it.. or too many people come into town(s) fully stocked and leave nothing behind but their trash on the way out. I'm working on council (#1 son is one of them) to get rid of the parking fees for the Penetang boat launch. Even I have to pay to use it.. and my tax dollars funded it! Up in Temagami council has been trying for years to get a majority on board to charge to use the lake access road to the hub (that starts 4 miles short of town), as a toll road, as 98% of those that use it NEVER come to town. They arrive fully stocked and wouldn't know where the local grocery store was if they stopped to ask directions twice. The only input they make to the township is emails of complaint on the roads condition. I say just get rid of the road, it was suppose to be removed when the copper mine came of Temagami Island in the 70's. Then everyone would have to use town..."
831891,misfish,2014-01-21 21:48:00,29133,"that's Innisfil, got that one covered  but now Barrie is the prize  Dont worry bud. We take my boat,and use the Barrie launch,no charge to you."
831901,Terry,2014-01-21 22:19:00,14456,kayak ??
831903,irishfield,2014-01-21 22:21:00,26272,He probably left an energy bar in our glove box Terry.. now making claim on your Lund!
831904,misfish,2014-01-21 22:21:00,29133,Is that what they call Lunds these days?
