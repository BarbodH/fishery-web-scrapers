I sold a used tennis racket on line, was not aware of the high fees ebay charge these days.  For those who intend to sell stuff, just ensure you are aware of these fees. I hardly sold anything on Ebay, I heard many sellers are leaving EBay and selling stuff on Amazon. or Ebid.or have joined two other growing China on line store."

831934,irishfield,2014-01-22 00:10:00,26272,Haven't sold much there in a long time.. but I'll have to go look to see the truth to this 10%. 3% to Paypal.. who cares.. it costs me 5.98% to accept a VISA or MC these days directly. I send everyone paypal invoices now...

831955,Handlebarz,2014-01-22 01:21:00,3790,I stopped selling on eBay shortly after they bought PayPal as there fees went up right away. At that time postal fees went up and out dollar went from $1.56-1usd to $1.10 so it was easy to stop selling. I loved it when our dollar was so low I was making a killing on everything.
