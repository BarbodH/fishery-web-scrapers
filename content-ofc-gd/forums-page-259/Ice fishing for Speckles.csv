831758,Trav_Haws,2014-01-21 05:12:00,2,"Hey folks. My buddy got me into ice fishing last year and I've been out a few times this year for lakers and perch but last summer I got hooked on speckle fishing rivers. The idea of catching some through the ice has been driving me crazy. I've been lurking the Fish ON-line site to locate stocked lakes up near bancroft and went up last week to one I had to snowshoe in to. Got skunked though. Just wondering if anyone had some tips out there, or if anyone has had any success this year for specks? Been doing a lot of reading but I like hearing what people have to say. Not expecting locations.  Cheers"
831767,Freshtrax,2014-01-21 06:16:00,2215,Minnows in shallow 2-8 fow this time of year
831800,jayess,2014-01-21 15:20:00,187,"We were out that way this past weekend as well, only we wish we had snowshoes... Trudging through three foot drifts was a workout!  Also skunked on the speck lake. They can be finnicky any season. Sometimes they're on fire, other times you'd think there's nothing in the lake.  I've heard much the same as what's suggested -- keep it shallow. Also, it's been advised to stay off the ice or at the bare minimum keep the noise down. Might be a good time to start a fire on shore and enjoy a warm drink."
831802,BillM,2014-01-21 15:28:00,17367,"I've found that the specs don't mind the noise at all, actually after you drill your hole the odds are really good you'll get bit right away."
831810,SirCranksalot,2014-01-21 16:18:00,3291,Look for trees that have fallen into the lake. The bait doesn't need to be alive. A chunk of beef has been known to work.
831826,wallacio,2014-01-21 17:26:00,475,"Yep, fish shallow near fallen trees (as mentioned), also rocky points as well as shallow, muddy bays which hold aquatic insects.   When I go, I always pack in some nightcrawlers (keep the container inside your coat if it's cold though!)."
831831,aplumma,2014-01-21 17:42:00,6896,You can keep the worms out just thaw them out when you need them by putting them in your mouth.   Art
831833,wallacio,2014-01-21 17:46:00,475,
831839,BillM,2014-01-21 18:03:00,17367,Make sure you read the regs (ie you're not allowed live minnows in certain lakes near Algonquin Park)  
831841,Trav_Haws,2014-01-21 18:06:00,2,"Haha thanks boys. I had worms last time, didn't put any in my mouth though lol. Do you guys think it's worth trying the same lake again ? It looked promising had lots of good speckle territory like your explaining. I feel they just weren't hitting that day"
831844,wallacio,2014-01-21 18:16:00,475,"Definitely, if it's a stocked lake chances are they are there (provided that it doesn't see heavy fishing pressure).  They can certainly be hot and cold depending on the day."
831845,irishfield,2014-01-21 18:22:00,26272,"Specks seem to be all about timing.. one time you'll get nothing.. and then the next time in 6 guys with 5 fish limits in 20 minutes. We swear they swim the perimeter of the lake looking for food, you just have to be ahead of the ""rotation"". We fish 6 feet of water MAX... tight to shore... seems to work."
832153,LesCulpJr,2014-01-23 05:48:00,75,Thats speck fishing:) Keep plugging away. I like a small buck shot rattle spoon for jigging. Jiggle it a bit in the dirt on bottom a bit then rip it aggressively at times hitting the ice with the lure. works good for shallow lakers as well. As mentioned make sure you check regs as most speck lakes do not allow live fish as bait. You can also try drowning a dry fly with a small chunk of worm on a light gad. tie a piece of flagging tap etc. on the gad so the wind gives it some movement
832154,Acountdeleted,2014-01-23 10:58:00,2562,Is it the same for spake? Last year I went to a lake that Buick14 gave me a hot tip about and I got massivly skunked.
832196,Sinker,2014-01-23 15:04:00,8692,"Yep, specks and splake are hit or miss. You either get them, or you don't.  S."
832394,LesCulpJr,2014-01-24 17:21:00,75,I actually catch most of my splake in deep water but yes they are normally very much the same as a speck.  It bare's mentioning that if you want to go try a new lake for specks you should prob first hit it in open water season to look for areas to try. Its a lot easier to than going at it blind in the winter...  You still wont catch them all the time though:)
