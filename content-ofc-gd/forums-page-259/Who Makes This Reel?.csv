Nearly a dozen and there is this one reel that he could not remember who made it. Lightly used it belonged to his old man back in the day. Here are a half dozen photo's I thought you guys could help me narrow the reel down. There is a small round patch in the frame on the side plate that might of held a sticker back in the day but is completely removed.  Any Ideas??              The kicker here is the only badge on the reel says JAPAN on the flip side of the reel. Any ideas?? Appreciate all the help!  MTBF

832287,Wolf 3,2014-01-24 01:25:00,134,Looks like  Fjord...  http://www.grandpastreasureschest.com/fishinghunting2.htm (scroll down a bit)    
832308,MCTFisher9120,2014-01-24 02:33:00,3761,"Yup you may be right wolf. Fjord S-106 I think.  He has this reel also, called a American Classic IV Spinning reel. Never felt anything this solid before, has a metal spool the works. It can't be worth 500 bucks anybody have good guesses on this reel, his is near mint.  http://www.ebay.com/itm/Zebco-Cardinal-4-Reproduction-American-Classic-IV-Spinning-Reel-/251432903760?pt=LH_DefaultDomain_0&hash=item3a8a91a450#shpCntId"
832336,Nipfisher,2014-01-24 05:46:00,2449,I have one almost identical. Mine is marked TAICO JAPAN It is marked with a model # that includes 281A but I can't find that model or there may be another number or letter that I can make out.
832414,LesCulpJr,2014-01-24 19:22:00,75,This looks to me like either an ocean city or true temper reel. Ocean city was bought out by true temper (same company that makes the hardware products) many moons ago. I don't think its too old with the Japan badge. Looks like a 922 or 923
