831849,Can_38,2014-01-21 18:50:00,152,With the plethora of wireless speakers available today I am considering shelving my off season project of installing a marine cd/mp3 player and simply semi-permanently keeping a wireless speaker in yee old boat.  Any board members considered or have done the same.  I like the following unit: http://www.braven.com/braven-brv-1-waterproof-bluetooth-speaker.html paired with a bluetooth IPod / BB etc..  Love to hear your feedback.
831853,BucktownAngler,2014-01-21 18:59:00,582,"i've never heard that one before, but i have listened to about 4 or 5 different models in the store, and the Bose was hands down winner.  http://www.futureshop.ca/en-CA/product/bose-bose-soundlink-mini-bluetooth-speaker-silver-soundlink-mini/10257469.aspx"
831855,lookinforwalleye,2014-01-21 19:14:00,4399,Sounds like a good idea to me but contrary to what the reviews say at 3 watts it`s not going to have much punch. I recently purchased a Marley bluetooth speaker for traveling and I don`t see why it would not be welcomed in my boat this summer.
831859,Can_38,2014-01-21 19:25:00,152,My boat is a classic 13' Boston whaler and therefore it sees its fair share of water splash in the boat so a waterproof unit is needed.
831861,Can_38,2014-01-21 19:27:00,152,"only downfall would be the lack of Radio I reckon, I do enjoy having the Jays game on while tossing a lure in the water."
831863,BucktownAngler,2014-01-21 19:40:00,582,i think you can get similar performance out of a $30-$50 speaker  you're paying a premium for the waterproofness

831875,lookinforwalleye,2014-01-21 20:39:00,4399,Another thing you may want to look into is one of those speakers that are designed for use in the shower...google sound dew.
831895,Old Ironmaker,2014-01-21 21:55:00,8243,There is a difference between Marine speakers and traditional other than being waterproof. The banging and bouncing off the water can effect the speaker and power components over the long run. Many have saved money just putting in a car audio system only to remove it when it was dead half way through the season. Boat TV had a feature on audio systems specific for marine application if I remember correctly. I'd hate to see a wireless speaker fly through the air when hitting a wave. Do they float?
831897,porkpie,2014-01-21 22:13:00,2521,"I have a lifeproof case on my iphone and a cheap plug in speaker from costco.  I only run the stereo when I'm sitting still, so spray isn't an issue.  I wouldn't bother with a stereo install these days."
831898,DRIFTER_016,2014-01-21 22:16:00,10439,"I'm still running my old Pioneer surface mount car speakers from the early 90's in my boat. They still work great even though they are about 20 years old and covered with rust. Heck, they weren't even new when I put them in. I was a car audio installer for many years and these were replaced for a customer through insurance because of an attempted theft which damaged the case on one."
831900,Muskieman,2014-01-21 22:17:00,2472,"Portable rechargeable unit , hands down , the memory of a stereo can kill your RV battery in a week , I bought a "" Sport Music "" for 20$ on-line , it sounds great ! Takes a mini SD card , is a FM radio with rather good reception , acts as a signal booster for your cell phone , can connect to your phone or MP3 player .. quite possibly the best 20$ I've ever spent , other than that time in Holland . "
831952,danc,2014-01-22 01:03:00,4677,I bring my sirius blaster in the boat and plug it in to an inverter. If it might get wet I throw it in a garbage bag and it sounds just as good.
831986,Can_38,2014-01-22 04:11:00,152,"Good input, thx."
831988,Can_38,2014-01-22 04:20:00,152,"Yup it's my pretend boat, but we love her."
832048,Dan668,2014-01-22 17:29:00,1120,I would just put A marine CD deck with speakers. I got my Sony set for 199. Sounds way better then a portable speaker. And I can plug my Sirius unit or iPod through aux. Makes a big difference when driving your boat where you might not hear you're portable.
