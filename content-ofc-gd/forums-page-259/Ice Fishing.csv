825716,ylind,2013-12-21 17:06:00,6,I recently moved into the KW area and would like to try Ice Fishing - perhaps a Day Rental type situation  Any advice  T.I.A.
825717,Locnar,2013-12-21 17:16:00,645,"Lake Simcoe. Lots of operators, lots of species to try. Cook's bay or Virginia beach if you want lots of perch action."
825730,bigugli,2013-12-21 18:17:00,6138,"Living in the Grand watershed. Best bets in your vicinity would be L. Belwood,  Guelph L., Conestogo L.. The area conservation authority does post ice info."
825735,GBW,2013-12-21 19:08:00,8460,"Welcome to the site. I have no KW info to offer, sorry."
825824,fishing,2013-12-22 00:23:00,167, Valens Lake and Shade's Mills Conservation Area should be open soon.  http://www.conservationhamilton.ca/valens-conservation-area  http://www.grandriver.ca/index/document.cfm?Sec=27&Sub1=131&sub2=0 
825833,limeyangler,2013-12-22 00:50:00,5204,Cant help with any info but just thought i'd say welcome to the site
825841,NAW,2013-12-22 01:09:00,4022,I also don't have any experience in the KW area.  But I second going out with one of the many operators on Simcoe.

825847,Woodsman,2013-12-22 01:18:00,1286,Carry on up to Lake Simcoe for daily rental places.. I drive through your area to head to lake Simcoe. If only looking for a spot locally without rental huts your options expand some.
825854,porkpie,2013-12-22 02:02:00,2521,"Guelph lake is closed to ice fishing these days by GRCA as far as I know, however belwoods is still offering ice fishing I believe (of course they are super careful about safe ice etc.) I believe shades mill, and pinewoods also have ice fishing.  Good luck!"
825912,ylind,2013-12-22 12:05:00,6,Thank you all for the info - as soon as the wife lets me out I will report back
825931,tater0025,2013-12-22 14:09:00,12,"Welcome to the site As mentioned above a few of the local GRCA lakes offer ice fishing, I know Belwood Lake (Fergus) and Island Lake (Orangeville) used to rent huts the main target being pike but being new to ice fishing I would suggest taking the 2hr drive to Lake Simcoe and targeting perch (more action to keep interest)"

832056,bowj,2014-01-22 18:30:00,8,"hey, has anyone had any luck out at Shades Mills or belwood yet this season?  what lures do you recommend and what depths do fish tend to be at? going out for my first time to one of these places and appreciate any tips. Thanks,"
