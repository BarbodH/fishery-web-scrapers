831524,atvaholic,2014-01-19 22:54:00,271,I've been invited there for a weekend by a friend. Does anyone have any suggestions / fishing tips?
831525,irishfield,2014-01-19 23:04:00,26272,Only thing I can suggest is not to drill a hole in Nevil Knupp's outdoor rink !

831662,atvaholic,2014-01-20 20:57:00,271,Wow it look like this is not a popular lake. I'll give it a go this weekend hopefully I can find a couple.
