832150,Stoty,2014-01-23 05:20:00,2910,"Hey all,  Just thought I'd share the latest tool that I've created for use while fishing. This not only helps with tournament prep, but also is very handy for ""fun"" fishing as well.  What I've done is built an online fishing log, where I input all the details of my catches (gps coords, waypoint#, weather, line, lure, depth, etc, etc) and it saves it to a database so I'll have access to all my waypoints on all my lakes, no matter where I go as long as I have internet/data connection on my iPhone/iPad.   Search Page - allows me to search my logs base on Lake/Species/Season. It will then display all the entries that match those criteria.     GPS Coords - my newest addition to the tool... this page pulls in my current location's GPS coords (lat & long)     Save GPS Coords - this page displays the coords, and allows me to transfer them to the next page where I'll input all the details of the catch.    Add Entry Page - This is the page where I input all the details of the catch. Notice my GPS coords that were pulled from the previous page    Edit Entry page - this allows me to go into any previous entry and edit/add/remove details of that catch or delete that record completely.     This tool has been extremely beneficial to me the past few seasons as I use it all the time on and off the water for prep for any tourny's or trips. Being a computer nerd pays off sometimes! "
832162,Cosmos,2014-01-23 13:39:00,588,It's awesome looking tool. Nice job.
832164,aplumma,2014-01-23 13:44:00,6896,Nice job now what is the password to get into it. lol   Art
832165,porkpie,2014-01-23 13:57:00,2521,"I do something that is nowhere near as high tech, and really I only do it for steelhead fishing, I record water levels, colour, fish caught etc by date.  Really helps me decide where I'm fishing on a given day based on my own historical data.  Works very well!  Nice job on the log!!"
832168,mattybculp,2014-01-23 14:10:00,388,I keep a book with similar details but would love to have a database like that to log my info into. Great Idea !
832169,BillM,2014-01-23 14:14:00,17367,that's pretty cool man... I do something similar but in a book.   Personally I'd much rather do it on the computer
832170,Stoty,2014-01-23 14:18:00,2910,"Thanks gents. Just glad to put my ""tron"" skills as my wife calls them to good use. Hahaha  If I'm at a lake with no cell signal, I have my backup binder that I write everything down in and just input it into the log when I'm back home. It's amazing the patterns you can uncover with a well organized log."
832173,Stoty,2014-01-23 14:21:00,2910,"I know there are a few apps out, but I honestly don't think I trust my ""classified"" data to anyone but myself. Plus this way allows for a lot more data and customization."
832205,manjo39,2014-01-23 16:21:00,354,"Time to make your own app, that will store private data.  I'll be first in line to buy."
832209,Stoty,2014-01-23 16:48:00,2910,Hmmmm.....not a bad idea.
832211,NAW,2014-01-23 17:14:00,4022,I wish I had something like that about 6 months ago.  My fishing partner's GPS got some sort of virus.  We lost over 300 waypoints....  This site you made will act as a great backup..
832212,Stoty,2014-01-23 17:34:00,2910,"Ouch, that's enough to make a man cry! Exactly another reason I made it...so I can have multiple backups of my data. Can never have too many of those."
832269,iFish4real,2014-01-24 00:30:00,386,Nice job now what is the password to get into it. lol   Art I know a Romanian hacker
832272,atvaholic,2014-01-24 00:36:00,271,Very Cool. But I notice yer not recording the moon phase lol.
832332,Sinker,2014-01-24 04:06:00,8692,I dont have time to input all that data.  S.
832333,jbailey,2014-01-24 04:16:00,866,nice work!
