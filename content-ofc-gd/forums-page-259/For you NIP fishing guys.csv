831687,Terry,2014-01-20 22:35:00,14456,whats is nip fishing  a backwards pin fisherman....lol
831688,Bernie,2014-01-20 22:37:00,3190,O jeez Joe.Another one to train....
831692,Joeytier,2014-01-20 22:55:00,3990,"Bring minnows...lol  Some guys swear by glow spoons, others by flashy flutter spoons.  Depends on the day like everywhere else.  I've had days where minnows weren't neccesary, but not many..."
831693,davey buoy,2014-01-20 22:58:00,5505,I like to have a scoop full anytime I go out.Cheap insurance!!
831699,Christopheraaron,2014-01-20 23:34:00,3525,"Minnows work well up there, when I was up they were using a 3 way rig with a muddler for whitefish and herring."
831705,kickingfrog,2014-01-20 23:55:00,8333,"Jiggin raps, or the like. Williams ice jigs and berkly gulp minnows if you have to."
831729,Rod Caster,2014-01-21 01:47:00,5784,"3-3.5"" flutter spoons, like Wabblers, mooselocks.  Swedish Pimples  Jigging raps  Jig heads  Tiny buckshots  Rattlin' flyers  Minnows or minnow heads on any of those mentioned above.  I've had great days without minnows, but it's really hard to not use minnows unless the bite is really good.  I suggest visiting North Bay Outfitters on Lakeshore Drive. They have a great selection of ice fishing baits for Nipissing, and I can guarantee that someone with offer help/advice..."
831765,Nipfisher,2014-01-21 06:02:00,2449,"Brian, when are you coming and how come I didn't know about it? If I remember correctly I owe you a couple pops. Tough not to use a shiner on your set (2nd) line. On your jigging rod you can do well with any of the imitation minnows or grubs. I have had lots of perch success using the Gulp maggots on small jigs. If I am not using shiners for walleye then I use jigging raps, airplane jigs, helicopter jigs, lipless cranks, or buckshot spoons."
831784,Headhunter,2014-01-21 13:58:00,5703,"Hey Brian, Last year when Wayne was up, he had some kind of plastic ""due dad"" that seemed to work for him. I know he got the first fish of the day (To which he took a great deal of joy, reminding us!) and more. I don't remember what it was called, hence the scientific ""due dad"" name above. I know you prefer to not use live bait, but let me tell you a brief story...  My first visit to Bernie's, I had two tackle bags, rods galore and an unwavering desire to catch the elusive Pickereye. I was fishing about 10 ft from Bernie, who was using a chunk of wood, with ancient 20lb mono tied to it. After Bernie had iced his third fish to my NONE, Being the smart guy I am, I decided to not fight it and go with the minnow. Now, I take one tackle tray and a couple of rods. Just thought you'd like to know. HH"
831789,Acountdeleted,2014-01-21 14:31:00,2562,"I don't know why anyone would want to ice fish without minnows. It's hard enough as it is already.  For me, the medium size Swedish pimple is all I've ever used.  Tip ups with a minnow on a red hook have often out fished my main line. Let me know if you're going up any time in March Brian. I'd still like to meet you."
831790,misfish,2014-01-21 14:32:00,29133,I got lots of due dads Joe. Many that don't catch nada.LOL  Sometimes the old ways are the best ways.LOL  I just wanted to see what the local yokals used.
831794,Rod Caster,2014-01-21 14:59:00,5784,"We also fish out of running vehicles. Don't bother with shelters or mitts or anything, just fill up and idle away"
831799,Steelheadphycho,2014-01-21 15:20:00,470,"Just courious gents, how thick is the ice on nipissing? South Bay especially?"
831818,Bernie,2014-01-21 16:48:00,3190,"After 20""  I doubt anyone noticed.It was tough going last weekend in the South Bay unless you were driving a skidoo.I took a skidoo out last weekend, best way to go right now.4x4 pickups were getting a workout, even on the well traveled routes. Seen a few spots where they got stuck.Anglers Haven was going back and forth on Skidoos the last few days.Hopefully this cold will take care of some of the slush. But even if it does, the ruts and ice clumps will make a slow trip in a truck."

831881,Bernie,2014-01-21 21:00:00,3190,Here is a pickup going by on Sunday.That is Dennis from Ice Bungalows.He usually keeps a good road to his setup. 
831999,Nipfisher,2014-01-22 05:23:00,2449,I got stuck in the ruts on Calander Bay on Sat.
832007,Rod Caster,2014-01-22 12:29:00,5784,It's gonna be hard on rocker panels out there.
832054,Jay T,2014-01-22 18:21:00,282,Sounds like it will be a little rough out there for my trip up this weekend!! We are using sleds and a ATV so it shouldn't be too bad. Need some snow to cover to smooth it out! Can't wait to hit the ice Friday morning...
832055,Joeytier,2014-01-22 18:26:00,3990,"You'll have lots of snow cover, ATV travel probably won't be too fun but likely doable."
832057,Jay T,2014-01-22 18:42:00,282,Thanks for the heads up Joeytier.
832152,LesCulpJr,2014-01-23 05:34:00,75,chubby darters were apparently hammering the eyes up there last year. Always done just fine with a jig and minnow though:)
832157,misfish,2014-01-23 12:04:00,29133,Hello there Les. Long time. Nice to hear from you.
