831676,Bernie,2014-01-20 22:05:00,3190,"I use powder paint on my jigs.It makes for a much tougher better gloss finish but whether it is faster or not I am not sure. I use them myself, plus give some away so it's more important to have the quality. The powder paint is hard as soon as it cools so no waiting for regular paint to dry.Easy to do once you do a few. The proper amount of heat is the key. Too cool and it goes on in clumps, too hot and it bubbles."

If you do ""puff"" it on make sure you have the correct respirator to prevent getting it in your lungs and it will really irritate the eyes too. Best is to heat them up with a heat gun and forceps then dip them then heat till it glosses and is smooth.   Art"

831710,gaspumper,2014-01-21 00:45:00,393,"I powder paint my jigs as soon as I pour them as they are already hot no need for reheating to paint.I pour 250 at a time and paint them,then put them in the oven to cure for 15 min. at 350 degrees.I do several thousand bucktail jigs a year.Best to use a fluid bed for your powder paint,you can make one for less then $10.00."
