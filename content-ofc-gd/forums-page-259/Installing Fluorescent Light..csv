832346,fisher,2014-01-24 11:44:00,451,"Just bought a 120 V 8 foot long fluorescent light fixture from kijiji and it has 4 wires coming out of it.  A red, black, green and white.  My plan is to connect a 3 prong plug to it so I can plug it into a times outlet.  Anyone know how I need to connect these wires to the plug (I am used to 3 wires, but am confused with the four) .  Does the fact that the fixture has 8 four foot lights have any significance to the number of wires/ wiring?"

832348,fisher,2014-01-24 11:54:00,451,The guy who sold it says its 120 v. I will check tonight.
832349,davey buoy,2014-01-24 11:58:00,5505,The guy who sold it says its 120 v. I will check tonight. Most of the 4' office fixtures I run into now are 220volt.
832350,iFish4real,2014-01-24 12:40:00,386,"green is ground for sure the others, I'd say white is the neutral red and black could go together  but I'd say u take a close pic of where wires connect to and message it to me"
832353,GbayGiant,2014-01-24 13:33:00,1780,Open it. Check the Voltage on the ballast. Could be 347. I have to ask why you bought a used light? They do not cost a lot and the hassle of picking it up at a certain time?  
832354,fisher,2014-01-24 13:46:00,451,I got what I thought was a good price on it and it pick up was only a few minutes detour on my way to work.   It's at home so I will have to check tonight. I'll send a pic of the wires once I confirm the voltage on the ballast.

832454,fisher,2014-01-24 22:07:00,451,Wow you guys are good. Came home and sure enough 347 volts.  They guy I bought them from says he got them from work and didn't realize it but is going to take them back.  Too bad because they are nice lights.  Anyone here know if they would still work in a 120 volt outlet or will that ruin the ballasts or my house?

Need a 120v ballast,and then rewired.Maybe time to buy new.You can buy a new fixture with ballast for just a bit more than buying a new ballast alone."
832456,fisher,2014-01-24 22:17:00,451,I am returning them to the guy on Monday on way to work but told him I would repost on kijiji in case I can sell them (and save me from transporting them). I listed them for the same price I paid. Anyone interested?  http://toronto.kijiji.ca/c-buy-and-sell-other-8-foot-fluorescent-lights-with-bulbs-347-volts-W0QQAdIdZ561713375
832457,fisher,2014-01-24 22:18:00,451,Thanks again DB.  Too bad it won't work.
832472,iFish4real,2014-01-24 23:46:00,386,try finding some 110V ones on kijiji for yourself
832473,ketchenany,2014-01-24 23:49:00,3229,If I needed them tou could probably throw them to my house
