After you drilled a hole the water froze and my boots stuck to the ice.  Happen to us this year Dave. 6 guys just standing by a crack. BOOM. We all jumped and watched a 2 ft crack close up 18 inches. Scary,but laughed afterwards.  Nice fish bud  When ya heading up this way? Been watching for some good reports on catchin some Whities Bro, haven't seen much. I may hit Big Bear Pt. and give it a shot. I've been hitting Erie a couple times a week, not catchin many Perch, it's been slow.  Some nice fish there.  I imagine that was pretty scary with the ice moving like that. I, for one, would not like that to happen near me!!  I bet you froze your butt off out there, it's so bitter out. You got that right Joey, haven't seen it stay that cold for that length of time for years, even next week it's going to be bitter. Mr Heater has been getting a work out."
