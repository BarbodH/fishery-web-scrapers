831527,Fisherman,2014-01-19 23:07:00,7201,"  Making a Tourtiere a la Saguenay. When it miserable out and the fish don't want to come for supper, you get out some deer, moose, bunny and pork, potatoes, onions and garlic.  Roll out the pastry into the big blue roaster, add the ingredients, cover with more pastry and slow bake for 5 hours."

831584,Fisherman,2014-01-20 12:33:00,7201,"I can email you some, but for some reason the taste just isn't the same.."
831596,Nipfisher,2014-01-20 15:02:00,2449,"Fisherman, that is very similar to Sea pie. Lots of communities up North have Sea Pie dinners where people contribute fish and wild game and it is cooked in the same fashion as in your picture.  From Wikipedia Sea-pie is essentially a layered meat pie made with meat or fish,[1] and is known to have been served to British sailors during the 18th century.[2] Its popularity was passed on to the New England colonies sufficiently to be listed in American Cookery. In Quebec this dish is called cipaille, cipâtes or six-pâtes (in French), and is a traditional Quebec dish. The French name originated as an adaptation of sea-pie.[3]"
831605,Fisherman,2014-01-20 15:26:00,7201,"The way my MIL explained it to me, Cipates is more of a Q City/Montreal thing, something like small meat pies. Tourtiere with the cubed meat is more of a Saguenay Lac St Jean thing. Besides that, they're both good."
