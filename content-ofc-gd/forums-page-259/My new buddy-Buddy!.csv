831171,Rod Caster,2014-01-18 13:29:00,5784,"Siberian Husky, 4yrs old, former sled dog, all shots/chips etc and I got him for $0.  He was aggressive to the other sled dogs so the owner considered him a financial liability (vet bills), but he's a melted fondu with people. I needed something around the property and so far he's doing great, unleased 24hrs too!!  He has a few traits that need to be worked on, like leaving my rabbits alone, better following the snowmachine and making sure he doesn't turn aggressive with food and strangers around, but other than that he's well behaved. He even followed me for 4kms off the lake yesterday and I was WAYYY ahead haha.  ..and also my new Jeep. It was pretty good on the lake yesterday.    "

831181,spinnerdoc,2014-01-18 14:52:00,556,Congrats. I haven't had a dog for a long time
831183,Sinker,2014-01-18 16:13:00,8692,"Good lookin dog. Sled dogs have a mind of their own, but very smart.  I adopted my dog from a member here and he's been a great addition to the household. Had him 5 years now, and I'm lost without him!  S."
831332,Rod Caster,2014-01-19 02:44:00,5784,"That's a good lookin' husky, leaf4! Ours is 100% outdoor, but everything is already covered in hair, including the back of my jeep haha.  Buddy certainly has a mind of his own, he's very loyal and responsive, but in some situations the disconnect is obvious (like him knowing there are rabbits 100m from his house)."
831365,Joey,2014-01-19 03:30:00,9122,"Awww, what a sweetie.  Congrats on the new dog and the jeep."
831396,wormdunker,2014-01-19 05:20:00,1711,Nice looking dog there Chad.  Dog hair in the new Jeep?  That's why we have vacuums!!
831481,Cosmos,2014-01-19 18:54:00,588,Congrats Chad. It's really nice dog. How do you like your new car? what trim is it?
831486,misfish,2014-01-19 19:21:00,29133,Friend for life there Chad.  Nice looking new buddy.
831497,NAW,2014-01-19 20:10:00,4022,"Right on chad!  Jeep looks great!  Get a pair of cross country skis and a dog harness..  Your dog will love you for it, you'll get a great work out and have a blast!  Get the dog to pull you on the lakes.  He'll go forever!"
831500,Rod Caster,2014-01-19 20:24:00,5784,"Thanks Costa, its the Trailhawk model. Pretty good offroad so far.  Nick, I think its called skijourning or something. I have the harness and the trails, I just need the skis!"
831504,NAW,2014-01-19 21:04:00,4022,"I got a great set for $40.  Skis, poles, boots and bindings. Good Ol' kijiji."
831617,fish_fishburn,2014-01-20 16:25:00,1311,Nice dogs. I have had four of them in my life time. Two Siberians and two Alaskans. They are very loyal dogs and make great pets. Beware though they are very stubborn as well. They are happiest when they are working. My last one was a Siberian and he was awesome. I trained him to haul my ice fishing sled to and from the truck and he just loved doing that. They love to chase rabbits and squirrels etc and I could never figure out how to break them from that habit. I used to save his hair in the spring time when their coat blows out and a lady used to collect it and spin it into wool and make winter mitts and toques with it. Its all about repetition when it comes to training. They are eager to learn but only for short periods of time then they get bored and stop listening. That's when you stop and call it a day. They need lots of exercise or they will become disobedient and dig your yard up like there is no tomorrow. Good luck with him.

Only thing we had to work on was getting them used to our kiddos friends, which just took some time, and if something is dead in the bush, their both gone.  Congrats on your dog, very nice looking! Nice jeep too!!!"
831731,Rod Caster,2014-01-21 01:53:00,5784,"Thanks Fish' and Manitou'  I haven't yet, but I really want to get him pulling...anything. So far I've been establishing the ground rules and the hiarchy. Hopefully in the next week or so I'll get his harness on, cut some trees and make him pull the cuts back on a sleigh.  That's really cool about the mitts!! I'll have to google that."

Thanks  No prob! Beauty dog.  Sorry to hijack this Chad, Twocoda did Paxton lose the use of his left eye? it's ok, those pics Twocoda posted are something else!! Sorry you and the dog had to go through that...yikes  Buddy will certainly be a prey-chaser and yep, I'm in a rural-wooded area. I really hope this doesn't happen to him, I appreciate the heads-up, something else to think about."
