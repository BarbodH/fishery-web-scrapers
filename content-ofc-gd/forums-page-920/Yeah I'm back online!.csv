285646,bigfish1965,2008-12-30 17:20:00,3382,"Finally got my ISP to believe me when I told them there was an issue with my new fancy modem. I could not stay on any website for more than two seconds without getting kicked and my phone shutting down. Extremely frustrating! I didnt even notice that the phone was dying at the same time cause I use my cell 90% of the time. So I got a new modem and two months free internet....man am I gonna download lots of stuff and make them pay:)  The conversations with customer service were laughable. Me: Oh, hi, my modem is wrecked I think, if I go online to any site that requires any bandwidth at all, I get disconnected and have to reboot the modem. Them; Is your computer on when you try to access the internet? Me: Uhhh..yeah. How else would I know it wasn't staying online? Them: Well you would be surprised at the number of people who call and their computer is not turned on. Me: Okay let me save you some time...I have tested this on two different computers, one on XP and one on Vista. It is the same result no matter what. I have checked and rechecked the router and even bypassed the router and the result is the same. Them: Oh, your using a router...it could be the router. Me: {bangs head off of the wall} No it is not the router. If I plug directly into my computer from the modem I get the same thing. Them: Is the modem turned on? Me: Are you serious? Can I talk to your supervisor please....  This went on and on and I get the standard ""we'll be there some time between 9 and 5 on the 30th"" The guy shows up at nine today and I tell him whats going on...He said 'Sounds like your modem is buggered'... He is my new best friend.   Now I have to go through all my PM's and stuff so bear with me till I get through them all."

285701,forrest,2008-12-30 18:50:00,1032,Bell and Rogers......they are not good at what they do when it comes to their ISP divisions.  They are either wasting a ton of money or making a ton of money with the ISP service.  How is it that others can offer a better ISP for 40% less?  forrest
