And the kids can spend a couple hours goofing off and singing along with joining the grown-ups in some board games and cards.  Tonnes of different munchy foods everyone is making and bringing along too add to the festivities as well.    We generally try and make these sort of things a good time for the little kids, the teenagers and for us big kids too  A couple people are non-drinkers who are going so they agreed to be the DD's for the night, so that way everyone else who wants to over do it on the booze and stuff has a safe ride  home"
