I was in Canadian Tire up in port perry on the weekend and saw the bait advertised on the commercial for 7 bucks, so I bought it. Has anyone used this specific buzzbait?"
253794,Raf,2008-09-30 00:23:00,3495,loooks exciting.  i am sure it will work.  the name has me chuckling.    on a few levels.  does it transform?  not sure the cost of other comparable bass sized buzz baits to say whether or not you been cavitronned.
253805,bassjnkie,2008-09-30 00:35:00,1101,"I guess it's ok, they even have a Cavitron bass boat. The secret is the holes in the blades. I was reading in a mag, years ago, about bending a regular buzzbait wire and drilling holes in the blades. I did just that and it worked quit well, made noise, came in stright and made bubbles.  Same concept as the one you boat, so I think it will work well"
