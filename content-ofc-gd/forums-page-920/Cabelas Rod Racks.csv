Assembled them the following day, no problems. They look great and function well. They do hold my lightest rods and even hold the musky blanks I have on hand. They swivel bases needed a little light oiling to get them spinning freely, no big deal. Over all I'm pleased.  Draw backs, well the $39.99 price tag elevated to $71.50 by the time they made it to my door, still less than Cabelas regular price. And like everything else these days they were made in China, isn't anything made locally anymore?  Now that I have them loaded up I probably should have asked for 3.       Have you received your's yet Solo?"

286554,Spiel,2009-01-01 14:39:00,9065," LOL....Dinky rods are for dinky fish, I excel at that. The two piece rods ""fixed"" would not even fit in my full size GM van, best leave them the way they are."
