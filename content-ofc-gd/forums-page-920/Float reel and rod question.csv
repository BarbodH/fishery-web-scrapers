286378,nancur373,2009-01-01 00:56:00,1211,Would like to try to float fishing this year for the first time. Don't want to spend much money in it right away. Need advice for rod and reel purchase. I have a budget 200.00 max.  Thanks  Curt

Dont skimp on the rod, you dont want to fish with a wet noodle that is heavy, but to be honest you can get away with a cheaper pin if you need to. I ran a Raven Matrix for two years and it still works like the day I bought it when I sold it yesterday. To be honest the thing spins better than my brand new (and much more costly) pin. Its only fault was a dead slow start up but that is easily fixed with a twitch of the finger.  Find a nice fast rod, and buy a used combo if you can. Something in the 12 foot range is best for overall fishing, and make sure the pin is in good condition there are lots of deals to be had for example if I saw this a week ago I could have set you up real nice for 200"
