278975,bobkayla,2008-12-13 07:09:00,148,"watched the show ,, i got a kick out of him but he""s fishin at some pond in florida catchin 4 inch bass ,,losin the good fish ,,throwin his rod ,in some wacked out track suit , am i gettin old or is this the future of fishing shows."
278984,Rich,2008-12-13 08:57:00,3927,Certainly not the future of fishing shows as the show has been cancelled from what I hear. They're running re-runs now but no more new episodes.
278987,OhioFisherman,2008-12-13 11:14:00,6623,"I have watched his show a few times, still trying to figure out why it was on. If your going to blow money putting on a fishing show put KVD on it! Marc Thorpe show?"
279010,bigugli,2008-12-13 14:11:00,6138,"Seems that every once in a while someone keeps trying to put WWF/WWE smack talk and noise into a fishing show.  Examples:  Dime store fisherman the FNC feud between Reno and Miller Scott Martin challenge Dave Mercer (a silly boy)  his redeeming grace is the volumes of info he provide ""The Boston Mouth""  I guess the idea is to keep us from falling asleep in our seats."
279012,Fang,2008-12-13 14:13:00,1330,1/2 of my life I won't get back  He must have married the daughter of a TV exec. Certainly the show I saw was zero entertainment. When he's on I switch over the Bell satellite to the Xmas burning log.
279024,bucktail,2008-12-13 15:04:00,1857,"He is so obnoxious I do find him entertaining, his old show was much better tho."
279144,Grimace,2008-12-13 22:25:00,2020,Not the best show.    Give him a break.    He gave it a couple of tries.   You can't fault a man for trying.
279199,lunkerbasshunter,2008-12-14 00:32:00,2585,"im not a fan of this guy at all, he just bugs me  cheers!"
279297,PatrickGG,2008-12-14 04:50:00,562,"The show was most definitely better last season when there was a challenge that involved money, as for this season it totally sucked   ."
279309,Cudz,2008-12-14 05:15:00,2652,His wife needs a bigger role on the show.
286126,BUSTER,2008-12-31 15:17:00,1336,Dear WFN ....Please stop playing re-runs of this fishing show.......gawd   last night 10:00pm and this morn same show 10am?  not to metion the show sucks and is he wearing eye liner?
286208,diggyj,2008-12-31 18:27:00,548,"Have seen the show a few times and I have yet to see him catch a monster bass. Enough of the poop chat by his camera man and producer. Calling bass Larries......The only good thing is his wife with her sexy""porn voice."
