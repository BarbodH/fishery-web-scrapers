286362,Twocoda,2009-01-01 00:12:00,4130,The rainbow recipe is now extracted from my wife....( you all owe me for what i had to go through )...actually every time is the best 5 minutes of my life...he he ( yes im refering to taking out the garbage) ha ha  6 litres of water enough course pickling  salt to float a raw egg ( aprox 2 cups) 6 cloves of finely chopped fresh garlic 1/2 tsp of dried thymne 1/2 tsp of dried rosemary 3 bay leaves (crushed) Juice of one fresh lemon ( squeeze the heck out of it ) 1/2 tsp Club house salmon seasoning Stir it all together and add  Rainbow trout Let sit in brine for at least 12 hours ( We always do 20 hours ) Pat excess moisture off when prior to smoking ( important !!!!)  Your smoker may vary from mine but i smoked for 13 hours in my cold smoker Put one thin coat of Hoisin Sauce on after 6 hours into the smoke  and the finished product looks like this ....     This is my favourite smoke of all time ....and ive tried hundreds...  hope you enjoy it too
