Here are a few pictures i took:         Not bad pic's for a 7 mega pixels. Can't wait to get some pictures of me and some big fish on this camera!"
285709,douG,2008-12-30 19:10:00,2693,"7 Mp is way plenty for almost anything.  I am still trying to get nice shots with my camera - it has lots of features, I am working at learning how they work."
285711,MCTFisher9120,2008-12-30 19:13:00,3761," Really? Great! My camera has a few settings, auto,close up,and motion...think it can take video to   I guess i will be having some short fishing clips for you all come the summer"
285715,danc,2008-12-30 19:21:00,4677,"Nice shots Mike. 7 mp is arguably too high for a point and shoot camera. Anything above 5 mp or so is when problems start occurring in photo quality. It's all because of the relatively small sensor size in point and shoots. The only reason that you might want a higher mp rating is if you plan to print large copies of your shots. I just had a 30"" x 20"" enlargement made of a shot that I took with a 5 mp camera. It turned out awesome."
285717,douG,2008-12-30 19:24:00,2693,Here's a few.

286217,profisher25,2008-12-31 18:46:00,185,"I have the classic, sony digital camera, and i plan on buying a new zoom-in lens for it... also i am using my school's DSLR for the time being (im in a photography class if anyones wondering ) but i plan on also buying a DSLR as soon as i get that kinda money"
286238,Radnine,2008-12-31 19:54:00,1538,These two could would make great paintings or puzzle pictures Doug. I am totally desperate for anything cottage like right now and these two hit the spot. Nice pictures all! Jim
