286006,DT10Sam,2008-12-31 04:51:00,480,"Hi Stoty,  It is not safe at all on the Bay of Quinte at the present time.  We are in for some cold weather for the next couple of nights and that should tighten up the ice out there. It might be okay this weekend and I would recommend going out form the Big Island where the current there is the least.  Play it safe nad use a spud every couple of steps to make sure that you are going to be okay.  I would expect that some locals will be out that way this weekend and you can follow them out.  Regards, Sam"

286017,DT10Sam,2008-12-31 06:44:00,480,"  It is south of Belleville..........take Hwy# 62 south over the Belleville bridge and then halfway between Belleville and Picton turn east on Demorestville Rd and that will lead you to Big Island.  Regards, Sam"
