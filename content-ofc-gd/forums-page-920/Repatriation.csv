I figured that If the Mods allow me, that you will find these photos very touching, especially for the Families that have to endear this horrible trip from Trenton to Toronto.  As a Soldier I found these Photos very compelling and sad, yet inspired.  I'm sure the PowerPoint has gone around many Army Units in Canada.  I Cant tell you who or when, but what is important, is that we salute our Heroes. Just take a few minutes and try not think that they didnt die for someones agenda, but actually believed what they were doing it for Canada. Unfortunately there will be more, God Bless them.  Rob The families and Hearst's are awaiting for the Plane that are bringing Home our Heroes   The arrival of the Plane   The first casket.  I imagine there will be a set of Pallbearers from Afghanistan including closets friends and a Senior NCO or officer, that will escort the caskets.   Its a sad Moment for sure even including the Aircrew that brought our Hero Home   The convoy is just outside the Gates of the Air Base.  In the Background are the CFB Trenton Buildings along the Runway.  I thought I would never ever see our Vets saluting our soldiers now.  I always thought that they would make the supreme sacrifice and our generation would not be ever worthy.  I was wrong.   The white car would be a Military Police vehicle   Along the stretch would be Firefighters  and Police saluting    There will be more than 50 such Bridges between Trenton and Toronto with Police, Firemen, Paramedics, as well as the ordinary person that will give their last respects for our fallen soldiers.       When I first seen these Photos, I was amazed that so many people would pay tribute.  We always hear the negative side of things.  Trust me, our Soldiers really appreciate this more than you can ever know.        I can guess how the cameraman, that took these photos must of felt, as well as the rest of the motorcade.  This is a great tribute also to the families that have to endure this trip       I would love to sit down and buy this guy a beer. Awesome Picture for sure.    Arriving in Toronto to the Coroners office.    Our Heroes"

286350,Big Cliff,2008-12-31 23:22:00,6899,"I know that many fly their flag at half mast in honor of the fallen. My flag flys tall and proud, the way they stood for our country and in support of all those still serving!  "
