Finally found the boat I wanted for a nice price so I pulled the trigger.  The guys at Outdoors Oriented in St. Catherines were a great hepl and made sure I had it strapped on really tight before I headed for the skyway.  Gotta admit I was a bit nervous driving on so so road conditions with this kite on my roof but nothing budged (obviously or this would be a different kind of post). Got a few funny looks from people going by me with a yak on the roof on new years eve  It's a Native Watercraft Ultimate 12'.  A canoe kayak hybrid if you will.  Actually the same boat jedi angler bought a few months ago though I didn't splurge for the super light material (I'll let you know how that decision works out at the end of next season).  Now I just have to sit here and stare at it for 4 months, sigh."
286283,purekgw,2008-12-31 21:07:00,585,another person to buy a yak WE TAKING OVER!   nice kayak by the way what you doing to it first?
286287,Leecher,2008-12-31 21:12:00,7832,Good looking ride Sean    Congratulations  I bet you can't wait to give that a try eh? Jacques
286290,TennesseeGuy,2008-12-31 21:15:00,957,Your basketball goal needs a new net and a warm barn to stay in.
286291,fishindevil,2008-12-31 21:16:00,6254,"Well you can sure be in a stealth mode now sean !!!!.  ..she will get you into some very secluded spots for sure bud,and even some rivers too,Nice ride,hey you guys are trying to take over !!!!LOL..LOL.."
286293,Canuck2fan,2008-12-31 21:17:00,1444,That is awesome and the fact that you defied aerodynamics getting it over the skyway without it lifing you and car off the bridge is even better LOL.
286296,jwl,2008-12-31 21:20:00,1056,"cool, wait until you catch your first really big one in that   , nothing like having to beach yourself somewhere to land your fish"
286298,tbayboy,2008-12-31 21:26:00,1497,"No plans just yet, going to wait until I've had it out a few times and see what tweaks I find myself wishing it had (skirt, holders, fishfinder bar, etc) and go from there."
286301,purekgw,2008-12-31 21:37:00,585,did it come with the front skirts on it or no?  and a milk crate would be something to look for to hold stuff
286327,forrest,2008-12-31 22:28:00,1032,"Nice, I bought a Hobie float cat myself at the end of the year.  I am thinking you will enjoy the convenience and silence of that fishing tool there."
286346,ccmtcanada,2008-12-31 23:10:00,7971,Awesome Sean!!!  I'm sure you'll get lots of good use out of it...see you on the Kawarthas next spring!!!
286400,highdrifter,2009-01-01 01:48:00,2534,That's a nifty little vessel brotha!  Pretty aerodynamic set up for the ride too.  Congrats!  HD
286613,LeXXington,2009-01-01 17:05:00,1928,"Thats cool Sean, read some reviews here if this is the same one http://www.georgiariverfishing.com/GAartic.../Ultimate12.htm  Fishfinder is a must,  The skirt not so much enless your doing more rapids etc. but it also does keeps the sun off."
286635,bbog,2009-01-01 17:56:00,665,"Yeah, looks like it would be less drag flipped over (canoe style).  Enjoy your new ride."
286650,Dano,2009-01-01 18:38:00,719,"Nice, should be a lot of fun. Cant wait to see you trolling the reach with it next November!"
