285864,ciceri,2008-12-31 00:19:00,535,"haha, cute."
285870,Whitespinnerbait,2008-12-31 00:24:00,2038,"She's a real cutie but , its best to break the bad news to her sooner than later..........The leafs will never win the cup again       "
285875,misfish,2008-12-31 00:29:00,29133,"Hey,be nice now.LOL"
285889,Leecher,2008-12-31 00:56:00,7832,Brian.... she's a real cuty but please tell her the truth..... you know.... red white and blue
285914,johnnyb,2008-12-31 01:29:00,3413,Wow -- what a sweetie!  Just another reason to be a Leaf's fan -- we're all good-lookin'
285916,irishfield,2008-12-31 01:31:00,26272,Even she can't believe what you said Brian... just look at the disbelief in her eyes !!!
285927,misfish,2008-12-31 01:47:00,29133, BELIEVE
285987,MarcusDiGiovanni,2008-12-31 03:50:00,182,They managed to win tonight
286005,jjcanoe,2008-12-31 04:50:00,744,"  BeLEAF!   Now tell that cute little granddaughter to get John Tavares in Blue & white (And not 10 yrs past his prime like so many other leaf pickups Lindros, Roberts, Mogilny, Joseph (again) etc.. Ok Mogilny was only 3 yrs too late)  jjcanoe"
286007,danc,2008-12-31 04:54:00,4677,Sweet shot Brian. I think that you should get a shot of you next to her with your Dale Jr. jacket on. Two teams that will never win their respective cups.
286079,lunkerbasshunter,2008-12-31 13:37:00,2585,great pic for sure!  Got to love it!  Cheers!
286083,Canuck2fan,2008-12-31 13:41:00,1444,She is a cutie for sure but slapping that losing sweater on her is just so wrong!!! Aren't you worried something like that will ruin her self confidence? LOL
286086,MCTFisher9120,2008-12-31 13:49:00,3761,Go Leafs Go!
286100,forrest,2008-12-31 14:28:00,1032, Disappointment happens in life.  May as well teach her early.  forrest
286101,forrest,2008-12-31 14:28:00,1032,---------------
286210,diggyj,2008-12-31 18:34:00,548,"Not going to happen. Until they shake things up at MLSE, they will never win. To many retards that know nothing about hockey in charge.  Same problem with the MNR, people in postions that know nothing about hunting and angling as well as don't do any hunting and angling."
286227,carp-starter,2008-12-31 19:36:00,253," Maybe you are correct and if you are, I will not see the Leafs win their next cup. We would have a better chance of winning if we had instead a team of women playing - just like that cute little angel - a team in PINK instead of BLUE.  1967   The second coming of Jesus is more probable than having the Leafs win the Stanley Cup.  carp-starter - Happy New Year"
286254,misfish,2008-12-31 20:18:00,29133,"  Now now Dan,there is always hope. Be nice.LOL    diggyj  This thread was not meant to be an argumentive topic."
286261,forrest,2008-12-31 20:30:00,1032,"  LOL I don't think there is much of an argument when it comes to talking about the leafs having a shot at the cup.  The topic can't be taken seriously  Nice baby BTW.  With Regards,  forrest"
286295,Fishing 24/7,2008-12-31 21:18:00,709,  RIGHT ON about THE MNR  nice picture btw!
