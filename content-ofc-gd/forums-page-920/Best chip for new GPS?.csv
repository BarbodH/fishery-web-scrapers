285742,Fishn Technishn,2008-12-30 20:48:00,198,"Wife got me a new GPS for Christmas.   It is the Lowrance XOG(crossover). Was wondering what the best chip would be. I fish mostly Kawarthas, Lake St. Clair and Long point Bay. Have heard that the Navionics chips were pretty good?? I DID use the search function but it is still vague. Any suggestions and/or experience would be most appreciated.  FT"
285763,Radnine,2008-12-30 21:47:00,1538,"Hi Ft, I have the Navionics Gold 14XG (Great Lakes & Maritime). It has all of the Great Lakes and the Trent System (which means the Kawarthas). I am not sure if it has Lake St. Clair as I am unsure of where it is, and so far the only way that I have found to check what is on each map is by opening them and then zooming out to find the myriad of over-lying squares, then zooming back in to see if the lake you are interested in has numbers in it. The search by name feature does not list Lake St. Clair (or most of the lakes that the card covers). If I sound slightly exasperated it is because I am. Now I should say that like every good guy, I have not yet cracked the owner's manual. But the way that it looks right now is that there is a list of maps (called names like 1G649Xl.nv2, not Lake Erie East) that you have to open then go find, in order to know what is covered. At first glance I would have to say that the software does not seem as user friendly as it could be. As far as the cards actual usefulness it is still a mystery to me. Jim"

285887,fishdawg,2008-12-31 00:54:00,912,get the Gold Chip as mentioned... yes it has St Clair  please post a review of that GPS after you put some hrs on it... im interested as to how well they will perform thanks
285935,rob v,2008-12-31 01:59:00,535,I'm probably going to need one of those chips also for the same area.  Sounds like the lavionics gold is preferred so far.   Anybody know anything about the fishing hots spots series and how they compare ?  I'm sure there are some older versions of these chips out there priced perhaps a bit more reasonably (i.e. used) - are the latest versions that much better if you're just looking for the basics - e.g. depths/contours?
285943,Twocoda,2008-12-31 02:14:00,4130,if its sunny out and your using the GPS ....sour cream and onion is the best ...but if its cloudy....BBQ chips all the way!!!!
285971,walleyemen,2008-12-31 03:14:00,316,"I recomend the gold navionics as well, takes alittle to figure it all out but once you do, it's great, lots of details and i like the idea of pre-fishing, searching a lake, shoals shallow areas,"
285979,Fishn Technishn,2008-12-31 03:39:00,198,Thank you to all for the replies. This is certainly going to help as I was leaning towards the 2008 Hot Maps chip(yes I know sour cream & bacon chips would be better for all you yucksters!!  )  Next question is  Anybody got any suggestions as to where is best place to buy in/around London??  Thanks again FT
286008,jjcanoe,2008-12-31 04:55:00,744, So far the XOG does super work in the big truck very user friendlyand bang on with distances and directions.  Looking forward to my birthday in April so I can pick up a lake card for mine as well.  jjcanoe
286016,Twocoda,2008-12-31 05:56:00,4130,You might want to check Lambeth Rod and Reel ...im sure he can put you onto a supplier if he doesnt have it
286215,Fishn Technishn,2008-12-31 18:44:00,198,"I had the same thought about asking Steve at Lambeth Rod & Tackle on Tues AM but he was closed,. Probably ""gone Fishin' So I stopped in at Hully Gully and their price was $299  OUCH!!!! I will check around as I don't have to have it until spring  Thanks FT"
