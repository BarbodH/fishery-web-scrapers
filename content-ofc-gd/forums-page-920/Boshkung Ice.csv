285936,bucktail,2008-12-31 02:00:00,1857,As of last week before the rain its was 7 inches of grey ice and lots of slush.....rain will actually help it out.
286200,Dan668,2008-12-31 17:51:00,1120,called a resort on the lake. they claim its not safe for this weekend
286219,fishboy,2008-12-31 19:02:00,550,that's a drag..and not the lake
286334,Dan668,2008-12-31 22:44:00,1120,called another place on the lake. only 2 inches. seems so little
