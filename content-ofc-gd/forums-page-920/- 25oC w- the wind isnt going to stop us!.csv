I was a little disapointed with the size of the minnow my local fishing store had but we still maneged to get some great action!  just as i finish drilling the holes ! PIKE ON!    You can see that they are feeding hard evry pike we got had the belly FULL hard as a rock! and they were still trying to fit some more minnows in there!  meanwhile my girl-friend stephanie is storming the perch in by the dozens!      a bit of action shots there!  this is where it gets interresting.  one of my lines slowly goes down.... im thinking bass..... the spool is going off... im thinking PIKE...  set the hook... nothing big.... BUT ! this POPS out!    A 1 lbs perch freak show! hit a 3 inch minnow!    this here is a big perch usualy!  one more litle rocket and we left .....    this bay always produces some fish .  as soon as you tip-ups are set you get into some action!  its a nice reliable bay from the ottawa!  Here is a little video id like too add to the report .  this was last year and the guy fishing is (WHITESPINNERBAIT) verry nice video!    hope you enjoi the freak show!  till next time!  24/7
