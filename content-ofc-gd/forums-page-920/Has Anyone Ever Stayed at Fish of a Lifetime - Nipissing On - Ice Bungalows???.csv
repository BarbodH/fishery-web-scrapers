282971,Doctrt,2008-12-22 22:54:00,141,"Any information - good, bad, or indifferent - on the on-ice bungalows at ""Fish of a Lifetime""?  All I can see from the website is a few slob-huge muskie pics, nothing about the bungalows or the ice fishing.  Early ice is predominantly good fishing on Nipissing but most of those reports come out of Callendar Bay and this place is, I believe, out of South Bay.  Thanks in advance. T"
282986,Guest lundboy,2008-12-22 23:13:00,0," Yes I have.  It's was pretty good. They put you on fish most of the time.   Tips: -Don't leave the screen door window open at night -Make sure you don't get the runs, because the ""outhouse"" attached to the cabin is basically a 5 gallon pail with a garbage bag and a toilet seat on it, heated by a mantel light.  Not something you want to have to use more than twice a day. -Bring good sleeping bags, and pillows."
283001,Beats,2008-12-22 23:42:00,543,  Sounds like there is one hell of a story behind these tips
283009,ccmtcanada,2008-12-23 00:04:00,7971,Hmmm...does anyone ever really need to be told NOT to get the runs???? LOL

283013,ccmtcanada,2008-12-23 00:09:00,7971, Ok...well TJ excepted....
283038,Greencoachdog,2008-12-23 01:35:00,8163," I have made it my life mission to not get the runs!  Most of the time it works, but sometimes... have you ever heard the term, ""thru a screen door at 50 paces?""..."
283043,Greencoachdog,2008-12-23 01:41:00,8163, Ya!!!... if yer standing behind me!
