286336,e-z-out,2008-12-31 22:47:00,1052,Hey Terry when do you plan on hitting the ice on simco?
286338,Terry,2008-12-31 22:52:00,14456,"I have been out a couple of times on south part cooks bay  but now I am waiting till I can get out for whitefish on the big part of the lake, hoping in a week or 2 but you never know"
286339,irishfield,2008-12-31 22:54:00,26272,We could take the boat bud....
286341,Leecher,2008-12-31 22:57:00,7832, Sure is a different view from the last time you posted a report
286344,Terry,2008-12-31 23:09:00,14456,yeah for sure I would think it is just a skim coat of ice and a feather would be too much weight for it but it's a good start
286347,Leecher,2008-12-31 23:16:00,7832," It sure looks promissing.... Out here with the mild temps and the rain it did help to thicken the ice....  we have a good 12"" of ice and are in the deep freeze again, -17C going down to -22C overnight"
286352,Leecher,2008-12-31 23:29:00,7832,Don't know if this is going to work but here is McLaurin Bay from the google satellite view  McLaurin Bay
286354,Terry,2008-12-31 23:32:00,14456,"that looks good, it worked"
286355,misfish,2008-12-31 23:36:00,29133," How was the ice were ya went looking today Wayne?  Nice yakk,n at ya today. I was a little worried that maybe a cop would come by, and think we were do,n a trade off.LOL   BTW That GM doesnt suit ya bud.  Safe drive out east."
286360,irishfield,2008-12-31 23:55:00,26272,"  Ice in Penetang/Midland Harbours..... I wouldn't be on it.. or lack there of thanks to ships and wind.  As for doin a trade off... that happens on the corner...in my laneway a few times a week. Cops don't seem to care...  The GMC is a step better than walkin to Ottawa Brian  ...and Terry and I have found a place to go on Friday, where the ice has been well tested."
286361,e-z-out,2008-12-31 23:57:00,1052,Lucky you Terry i'm still waiting to find a good lake to hit. But at the same time looking to go out on the ice with other just in case. Better safe then sorry i say.
286368,misfish,2009-01-01 00:19:00,29133,"Wayne, yer not saying yer going for the little fish are ya?LOL"
