285843,Joey,2008-12-30 23:52:00,9122,"Wonder who else they would be referring to if not made by humans?  Aliens, Monkeys???  My mom got a stapler for xmas and this was the label on the box.    Joey"
285844,irishfield,2008-12-30 23:54:00,26272,How long you been around here Hon.... you know there's other beings out there.. well here for that matter !!
285853,Joey,2008-12-31 00:09:00,9122,"Ya, but they don't make staplers Wayne"
285858,Clampet,2008-12-31 00:14:00,1947,"It was probably made in China. Many times they have difficulty coming up with the correct word/expression and that is the result. What they were trying to convey was that the item was made by adults and not by children, as may have been the case."
285860,bigugli,2008-12-31 00:15:00,6138,"As in assembled by people, not an automated assembly."
285863,Clampet,2008-12-31 00:18:00,1947, I say it is definite proof of child labor!
286127,camillj,2008-12-31 15:17:00,1988,"My best guess would be that this is the translation attempt for ""Hand Made""  Which somebody probably told them was a realllllly gooooooood thing over here ..."
286129,BUSTER,2008-12-31 15:19:00,1336,i agree
286148,Dano,2008-12-31 15:58:00,719,I must say those are some pretty interesting conclusions Clamp-it.
286178,jediangler,2008-12-31 16:59:00,1923,"Must be a translation thing. On the tank of my BMW motorcycle it says ""Keep head, wear helmet""."
286181,bassjnkie,2008-12-31 17:03:00,1101,That's funny. May be this would help. http://www.madebyhumans.com/

Product Details Title: Staple-Free Stapler - Matte Silvertone Sales Rank: 38417 in Office Products Manufacturer: Made By Humans, Model: STN-451 Item Dimensions: 2.38 x 2 x 2 inches, 1 pounds Package Dimensions: 2.5 x 2.5 x 2 inches, 0.1 pounds    and a reviewers comment  ""These ""stapleless staplers"" work well in the psychiatric hospital where any small metal object becomes a weapon or tool for someone intent on harming themselves. I don't know what brand is used at work but it sound from the reviews it works very similarly. I gave it 4 stars because it does punch a hole in the papers and it only works with a max of about 4 pages""   Would work really well where I work  we qualify for the psychiatric label"
286263,Joey,2008-12-31 20:33:00,9122,"Well there ya go, that explains it.  We had a good chuckle anyhow  It actually is a pretty cool stapler.  Thanks  Joey"
