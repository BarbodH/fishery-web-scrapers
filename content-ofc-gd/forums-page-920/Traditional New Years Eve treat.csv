286094,bigugli,2008-12-31 14:18:00,6138,I get a 1/2 dozen neighbours showing up News Years at my door. Each with a bucket of  olliebollens or appelflappens and the bowl of icing sugar to sprinkle on top. The custom is to share it with neighbours and friends.  So I gather you are a klomper.  New Years Day is usually a fishing day. Rest of the family can't seem to crawl out of bed.
286097,Radnine,2008-12-31 14:20:00,1538,"Olibollen! I haven't heard that name for a long time. My dad is Dutch (came over when he was 20) and he used to make olibollen (minus the fruit) at Christmas I think. It was yummy. My Canadian mom did her best to drive anything remotely Dutch out of Dad, but I remember the tasty bits of deep fried dough with icing sugar. As far as my own new year traditions go, we don't really have any. See what happens when you banish culture from the house. Thanks! Jim"
