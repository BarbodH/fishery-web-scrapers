Between 3 of us, we had 5 whities and 5 lakers......the lakers went back down the hole until Jan. 1st, but the whities got an invite back home for dinner ;D  This is the only pic I took, and I caught one more after this pic.    Next up is simcoe perch, and bog eyes ;D  Sinker"

285636,snoil,2008-12-30 16:56:00,139,Meant to ask how thick was it?
285639,Sinker,2008-12-30 16:58:00,8692,"  There was about 6"" of good hard clear ice, and another inch of frozen slush on top. Plenty safe for walking. There were guys out with bikes and huts too....  Sinker"
285647,Beats,2008-12-30 17:21:00,543,WTG.  Looks like a nice simple and effective setup.
