286026,Dnthmn,2008-12-31 09:44:00,128,"Hello,  I've been lurking on the board for a little while now and figured it was time I introduced myself and started participating. I've picked up some great info here and moving forward I hope to be able to share some as well.  I've been fishing ever since I was big enough for my Dad to take me to the river and ensure I didn't fall in by tying opposite ends of a rope around both of our waists. Now it's my turn to instill a love of this sport to my son and I'm looking forward to when he gets a little bigger and we can start letting mom sleep in and go out on the boat together. My wife is really looking forward to it.  Happy New Year Everyone.    Dan  Sorry about the double post. Connection was really slow. Guess I shouldn't have clicked the button twice!!"

286033,Dnthmn,2008-12-31 10:33:00,128,  Thanks for the welcome and the correction on the result of my itchy clicker finger  memart - the first report from me will be coming as soon as we get some cold weather that sticks around long enough for ice. If not I'll have to pile some boys in the jeep and head north for the day.

286307,Dnthmn,2008-12-31 21:45:00,128,"Thanks for the warm welcome everyone.    johnnyb - My boy is 22 months. He's still not too sure what's going on yet, but he'll get the idea within the next few years. Right now I make it a point to hold him in my lap and drown some shiners or wax worms at the campground we spend our summers at. It's awesome seeing what his reactions to the blue gill and other pan fish are going to be. Last summer when I showed him fish we caught he would either poke them then get scared when they flopped or kiss them"
