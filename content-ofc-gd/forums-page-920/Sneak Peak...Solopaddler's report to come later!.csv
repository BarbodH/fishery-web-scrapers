Well...I couldn't pull off both days, but with Bly's blessing, I drove there last night and fished day two with them....which was today.  Here's a sneak peak of today's action....Solopaddler and BillM will have tons more pics and the entire story later...  BillM with a nice one...   Solopaddler with a beaut!   And me...

The fishing got hot every 30 mins or so, pretty much what it was like the entire day.  I wish I got a pic of you talking on the phone and setting the hook.."
285966,ccmtcanada,2008-12-31 02:58:00,7971, I wasn't talking on the phone.  I thought a call was coming thru and I was trying to answer it when the fish hit...at the time I was looking at my phone...amazing I didn't drop it in the water!!! LOL
