The crumb is  chewey and soft, sweet and yeasty, with a crisp and crunchy crust.  Measuring and adjusting the oven temp, using more water, letting the dough rise more, and making smaller loaves helped."

286013,crappieperchhunter,2008-12-31 05:26:00,2582,YOUR KILLING ME!!!! I just HAVE to get off my arse and give it a go. Thx for sharing.
286018,buckster,2008-12-31 06:57:00,530,DouG!  That is prime bread for some Gweeches......... im gonna have to call Meely up and come on over lol
286322,douG,2008-12-31 22:25:00,2693,"Yup, truly an Italian style country bread.  When you see Emilio, tell him I say Hi, and that our outing on Simcoe with Ron and Rattletrap about 5 years ago got me sold on the Gweech religion, one I have shared with a few OFNrs.  Mebbe I should make some more, it doesn't seem to keep around here at all."
286342,Big Cliff,2008-12-31 22:57:00,6899,"The fun is just beginning! Now you can try multigrain, rye, (one of my many favorites) sour dough,  now you know why they call me Big Cliff LOL. I just found the perfict recipe for Southern Style biscuits I have been trying for years to get them PERFECT (guess they'll soon be calling me ""Really Big Cliff"" )!  Keep up the good work and if you run out of recipes to try, let me know, I've got books of them!"
286343,Twocoda,2008-12-31 23:03:00,4130,The first time i made bread ( before bread machines ) they came out like bricks ...litrally hard as rocks... could have bricked a house ...so ...on goes a coat of shellac and they were donated to a theatre group for staging props...  good on ya for getting it right ...
286357,misfish,2008-12-31 23:43:00,29133,"Some procuito (sp?) and some nice porvalone,with a piece of roasted red pepper,PERFECT.   That looks just awesome bud. You,ll be eating well come this ice season."
286389,Canuck2fan,2009-01-01 01:27:00,1444,Awesome looking bread did you use the old trick of putting a smoking hot cast iron pan in the bottom of the oven with a couple of ice cubes in it to make steam to give that real italian crust?
286599,douG,2009-01-01 16:24:00,2693,"I had a cast iron fry pan heating up along with the oven, and I poured a cup of boiling water into it when I put the bread in the oven (bread first!).  I sprayed the loaves with water a few times as they cooked."
