The pattern is supposed to break for the weekend and then go right back to very wet for the first 2 weeks of May.  As of April 18, 2011, the water level elevation of Lake Nipissing was 195.40 metres. The lake level is 22 centimetres above the long-term average. The lake level is expected to rise during the next few days. Further change in the lake level is dependent on the amount of inflows and precipitation.  Good thing is when lakes drop low and then go high the productivity usually explodes in a few years. Lets hope!  "
