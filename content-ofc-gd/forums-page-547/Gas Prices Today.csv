576679,Gregoire,2011-04-27 11:01:00,1397,Driving from Toronto to Montreal and back on the weekend I found that the prices in the GTA are much higher than outside the GTA. In Napanee the price was a few cents cheaper. I stopped in Port hope and found the price about 10 cents cheaper. The prices are so inflated in the GTA that they were only a few cents cheaper than the GTA.
