On Friday night I got all my gear ready and couldn't wait to head out the next day.  I left the house at 5 am and got to the creek an hour later.  On my first drift I hooked into a steelhead!    I caught a few yearling trout and then decided to move a little further upstream to the next pool.  The first drift at the new pool resulted in me hooking into my first ever brown trout.    A few more casts later I hooked into a decent steelie. While I was fighting it, the screw on my islander fell out and I subsequently lost the fish. I looked for the screw but couldn't find it. So I went back to the car to get my spare reel.  I ran back to my pool and started fishing again. For literally for two hours I caught a fish on every single drift! I didn't take pics of all the fish I landed.                                  At around 10 am the fishing slowed down and I thought I may as well leave on a good note.  My hands were numb and I was soaked down to the bone, but I didn't care. It was worth every minute."
