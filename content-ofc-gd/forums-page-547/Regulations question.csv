576357,Dave Bailey,2011-04-26 14:51:00,1641,"I'm no lawyer but I thought I was pretty good at figuring out the rulebook, but this one has me stumped. In the Exceptions to Zone 15 Regulations on page 76 it states:   Okay, so if I'm standing on the south side of the Pickerel River in Zone 15 I can't keep a muskie smaller than 122cm. But the river forms the boundary between Zones 15 and Zones 10, and 11 to the north, and it isn't mentioned at all in the exceptions under Zones 10 and 11. So if I'm fishing from the north shore it doesn't apply? As far as I know the regs don't say that the zone boundary includes the entire river from south shore to north shore. I suspect that the law applies to both sides of the river, but it isn't clear from what I can tell. If a person wanted to fish on the north side and had only checked the regs for those zones they might find themselves in trouble. In my opinion the exception should be copied into both Zone 10 and 11.  I'm only posting this as a curiosity really, it just struck me as weird."
576358,bushart,2011-04-26 14:59:00,2628,Is it also in the exceptions in zone 10 and 11?  I'm sure they mean the whole river
576359,Dave Bailey,2011-04-26 15:00:00,1641," No, as I said in the original post it isn't mentioned at all."
576360,bushart,2011-04-26 15:03:00,2628,Weird huh?  Still would'nt want to try and fight that one
576365,Terry,2011-04-26 16:05:00,14456,well I think it shows the river in 15 so even if you are on shore in 10 you are casting to 15 so only 15 regs would count...that's the way I saw it
576447,johnnyb,2011-04-26 19:47:00,3413,I'm wondering when they're going to change the river to it's proper name....the Walleye River....  
576450,bushart,2011-04-26 19:51:00,2628,I thought it was ZanZibar or sumptin like dat
576519,Dave Bailey,2011-04-26 22:21:00,1641," Shows it in the maps for Zones 10 and 11 too, it's the boundary."
576561,Woodsman,2011-04-26 23:53:00,1286,"This is totally correct without the ""I think"" part. The river is completely in Zone 15. This map shows the detailed boundary of Zone 15. http://www.mnr.gov.on.ca/stdprodconsume/groups/lr/@mnr/@letsfish/documents/document/198782.pdf Zoom in to the area for better detail. Note: WE stands for ""waters edge""."
576565,farsider,2011-04-27 00:05:00,456,"Not to worry, Zone 11 already has a 48""min and Zone 10 has the same exception with regards to the French River and downstream to the Delta, which the Pickerel flows into after David's Bay.  So even if the Pickerel River was not zone 15 (which it is), the same size limit applies.  Cheers,  Mark"
576650,Dave Bailey,2011-04-27 03:47:00,1641, GRRRRRRRRR...   :wallbash:    I should have checked that part. Can I plead insanity? I'll bring my ex-wife as a witness.
