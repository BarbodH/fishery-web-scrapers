It was a far cry from Good Friday last year, with 20 to 30 km winds battering us for the couple of hours we managed out on the lake. We ended up skunked for the day, bar a tiny OOS bass.   Unexpectedly, yesterday turned into a fine Easter Sunday...     I snuck out with the dog for an hour or so, and got a few decent crappie, biggest being about a 12 incher...     ...which quickly turned into this...     The bite was far from fast & furious, really had to work the tiniest nibble into a bite."

Just a quick pointer in your filets, there's an extra little piece of meat that is boneless on a crappie that is just behind the rib cage. You should be able to get a little extra bite out of your filets!"
