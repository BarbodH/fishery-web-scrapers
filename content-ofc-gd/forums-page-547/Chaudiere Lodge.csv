We decided to move from the middle french (last year, Wolseley Bay) to the upper french this year and are giving some thought to staying with steve at chaudiere lodge. Just looking for any feeback on the lodge or fishing quality on the upper french for august. thanks guys"

If there is any way you could move the trip into September, or back to July, you might have better luck.  How did you make out in the Wollsey Bay area?"

Sadly enough we have to go at the beginning of august due to the fact that most guys in our group can only get that time off so cest la vie! we will try and make the best of it. We were at wolsely bay in june and it was slow for sure lots of little pike and some acccidental ooo smallies, with one decent 45"" muskie caught in the north channel trolling a 6 inch white husky jerk.(8pm at night) It probably wasnt the best time of year for us to go but the price was right for sure ! if you have any info you could share thats great and if you have any questions regarding the middle french perhaps i could help. regardless im hoping the fishing is a little better but understand that nothing is for sure ."
