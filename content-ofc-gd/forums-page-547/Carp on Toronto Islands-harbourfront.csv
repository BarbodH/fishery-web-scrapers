576172,kayak fisher,2011-04-25 20:58:00,66, Really just about anywhere in the Toronto Islands canal is good for carp.  I usually take the Hanlans ferry and walk towards Centre Island fishing along the way. Have fun....there are some monsters in there.
576261,Afraz,2011-04-26 00:33:00,250,Swan rides center island.  You can see em sunning
576325,landry,2011-04-26 05:08:00,1005,Can you see them feeding and flyfish for them there?????
576389,ADB,2011-04-26 16:59:00,444,I've seen them jump and roll along Queen's Quay at Harbour Square
576427,rhymobot,2011-04-26 18:23:00,174,"  Yup, pretty much anywhere on the Toronto water front from leslie spit to the exhibition i've seen them surfacing and rolling. Up to 25lbs I've seen.  Last summer I was at queens quay a few times and always saw a few of them.  I always see them here:  http://maps.google.ca/maps?f=q&source=s_q&hl=en&geocode=&q=queens+quay&sll=49.891235,-97.15369&sspn=44.273191,135.087891&ie=UTF8&hq=&hnear=Queens+Quay&ll=43.639127,-79.377543&spn=0.001508,0.004123&t=h&z=19  In that rectangular area. Especially in that pocket in the corner."
576542,Afraz,2011-04-26 23:09:00,250," No they are just sunning, although i never fished for em.  What you can do is chum with some bread so while it floats and the carp come up to eat. Throw in a fly that imitates the bread.  Might work that way."
576600,crossover,2011-04-27 01:21:00,172," Thanks for the tip, we may as well try there before and after the Islands."
