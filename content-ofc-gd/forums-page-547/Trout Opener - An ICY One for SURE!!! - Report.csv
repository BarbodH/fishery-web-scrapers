576297,l2p,2011-04-26 02:36:00,346,nice speck!
576346,Leecher,2011-04-26 13:18:00,7832," Carl I don't blame you to call it quits.... not worth risking your life.  The ice over here was going fast last Friday.  According to whitespinnerbait, when he left late in the afternoon, the white ice had turn to slush.  With the last few days with temps around 15C think that's the end of it     I'm going there next Saturday for sure   This time I'll be able to chuck hardware in the mix  Edited to ask:  Did you get any on your last trip?   Thanks l2p!!!"
576348,Fish Farmer,2011-04-26 13:56:00,2234,Thanks for posting Leech. That speck looks tasty. Nothin better than Brook Trout fried in butter MMMMM
576351,Leecher,2011-04-26 14:05:00,7832," Thanks Fish Farmer!!!  Funny you mention ""trout fried in butter"" cause I gave that one to my mom on Sunday and that's exactly how she cooked it.  She phone back yesterday to say that it tasted real good"
576404,carll2,2011-04-26 17:33:00,443,"   yep 2 more lakers...20 inch and 23 inch, not huge but fun to catch jigging.. saturday its the good old wiliams wabler and 4 feet fluro and a worm trolled very slowly..."
576467,walleyejigger,2011-04-26 20:42:00,876,"dedication, good stuff"
576566,Leecher,2011-04-27 00:11:00,7832, Right on Carl   Don't forget the Black Fury with yellow dots dressed   Thanks walleyejigger!!!
576620,carll2,2011-04-27 02:22:00,443,  is the black fury with fur on the end or regular furless hook? got a bunch but never used them
576731,Leecher,2011-04-27 14:12:00,7832," #2 with fur, yellow dots on blade... cast it off to shore structure like fallen trees, stumps, drop off, points... give it a try, they are killer for specks"
575329,Leecher,2011-04-22 21:53:00,7832,"Well folks, today was the day, trout opener for us up here ""insert YESSSSS emotion here""   Been waiting very anxiously for this date, had a very detailed plan I wanted to execute and it all got thrown out the window the minute I arrived    Keep reading you'll understand!  But first, let's start with the details  Temps when I got up    Time I left home    Time I arrived at destination    The view of the office    As you can see I had very little shoreline to play with     Thanks to mother nature for blowing her north westerly overnight and dipping the temps to -6C  The only open water was in this bay on the other side.... could not go over because of private land so I had to think of another plan to execute.... the only thing I could think of, was to throw a rock to create a hole and then cast my line beyond that hole, retrieve the slack to get my sinker in it and then release the drag and hope for the best  Well that plan sounded real good at the time and I wasn't driving back just because everything was frozen..... NONONO  I got my line exactly where I wanted on the cast and positioned right,  retrieve the slack and BINGO, the sinker goes down WHOOOO HOOOO  At this point I'm not overly confident to catch something but I'm hopeful    I didn't get a sniff and I'm getting cold from the wind blowing but I kept being hopeful     Then Paul aka Whitespinnerbait comes along with Craig aka Cprince and try to get their tinny launched.... they did get it in the water and at the same time, created open water for me  The ice braker    Then not long after they had launched.... I get a very subtle hit    I set the hook and landed my very first & only speckle of my stay  13 3/4er""    This one was caught on the slip bobber rigs I had made last fall.... she swallowed it deep.... almost in her stomach    that is why the blood all over   sorry  And this one adds inches for Team 8   Not the biggest but it's a start    At around noon, I decided to leave since I wasn't getting any hits.... I think that another week and the ice will go  Also made a little video with additional raw footage... Enjoy!!!

575336,misfish,2011-04-22 22:30:00,29133,"Buddy almost went for a flop.That would of been a classic.  Do you all have different PFD laws then we do here?Looks like a barebone craft to me.  I would suggest a 1 oz slip sinker to reach that open water,"
575340,Twocoda,2011-04-22 22:48:00,4130,not sure if you would need one B....they were ice fishing ?  Another great production Jacques you did well under the circumstances....
575344,misfish,2011-04-22 22:51:00,29133," I just wasted a sip of screech with that.Just say,n.U owe me.LOL"
575348,Leecher,2011-04-22 22:58:00,7832, Yeah he did B    but don't shoot the messenger.... I was on shore safe and sound.... just an observer As for the 1oz sinker.... can you ship a reel spool that will hold 1000 meters of 10Lbs mono?   Ice fishing is an understatement Thanks mon chum!!!
575349,Live2fish85,2011-04-22 22:58:00,1633,Great report it's to bad that there was so much ice but at least you got one.
575351,Leecher,2011-04-22 23:00:00,7832, Thanks Live2fish85!!!  Another week me thinks
575362,Live2fish85,2011-04-23 00:07:00,1633,"Yea that ice doesn't look like it will be around to long seeing as the little boat was going through it but it's also still cold at night as you showed us. Looks like a beautiful spot you have there, nothing like being up north that's for sure. I don't know why I ever moved back to the big Nasty city of Hamilton lol."
575371,Whitespinnerbait,2011-04-23 00:29:00,2038,The original lake we had in mind..................There were doods ice fishing on it  Turned around and headed back south for an hour......to the back up lake .  BTW....   Whats a PFD
575373,MCTFisher9120,2011-04-23 00:34:00,3761,"Good Report bud, love the boat shot in the ice  Thanks for sharing,  MTBF"
575375,Joey,2011-04-23 00:48:00,9122,"Well you caught one, that's better than none right  Great report, pics and video  Now will Mother Nature please cooperate from here on out, please!!!!!!"
575413,asdve23rveavwa,2011-04-23 02:41:00,2690,"Nice Jacques!!!  Going to be a bit warmer down here for our opener, lol!  We're heading to an inland lake tomorrow as well, I'll see if I can up that 13 3/4""es for our team."
575419,Cudz,2011-04-23 02:49:00,2652,"Nice work with the fish given the circumstances  on another note, looks like you have a chevy cruze.  If it is yours, what do you think of it?"
575425,carll2,2011-04-23 03:25:00,443,"awesome stuff jacques!!! i too was a little disapointed to see my lake completely iced over this morning, had to put 2x4s down since the first 5 feet from shore was open but after that further out a solid 13 inches of ice...the ice wont be out here for the next 10 days or so..still caught 3 specks and a laker..going back at 6am tommorow"
575429,limeyangler,2011-04-23 03:52:00,5204,Brilliant!...love the rock throwing technique....i tried that once...realized i would need a freekin boulder to do the job though   The boat shot is priceless....was gonna ask why they did not invite you in the boat...lol....even if there was room...like you i'd have stayed on shore.  Great report...good job on the fish too....10/10
575450,Leecher,2011-04-23 12:29:00,7832, Thanks Mike!!!They eventually got to open water   Thanks Joey!!!  That one was a real nice surprise.... it kept me from packing it in early   Thanks FRANKIE!!! Good luck to you   Thanks Chris!!!  Yes the Cruze is mine and I love it... Very economic on gas (just about 1/4 tank for round trip 215km's)   Thanks Carl!!!  I had about 25-30 feet to play with and the ice was not thick enough for me to venture out onto it... Sounds like you had better results then me!!!  Good luck to you!   Thanks Simon!!!  Yeah the rock thing worked like a charm.... Got to love plan B sometimes
575452,TroutnMuskieHunter,2011-04-23 12:40:00,1362,Whitespinnerbait doing what he does best at the front of the boat  CLASSIC!!!  
575455,canuckjack,2011-04-23 13:04:00,121,"Wow, now that's persistence, nice catch.  Nice to see The Bear lost it's virginity again..."
575519,Leecher,2011-04-23 18:11:00,7832," Thanks canuckjack!!!  I don't know why they changed it in the first place    But I really prefer ""The Bear""  has a better punch to it"
575604,Rod Caster,2011-04-23 22:39:00,5784,Too funny guys! You never know what the weather will throw at you...and you threw a rock right back at it! haha  Go team 8!!!  
575643,Leecher,2011-04-24 00:19:00,7832, Thanks Chad!!!  It's 16C right now.... what a change in temps   hoping it melts what's left of the ice
576035,corvette1,2011-04-25 12:02:00,1765,awesome outing leech looks like the ss icebreaker
576044,The Urban Fisherman,2011-04-25 12:43:00,2050,Lol that's awesome!  No ice in sight down here buddy but I only landed 1 trout for my opener as well! Thanks for pics and funny story dude!
576217,Leecher,2011-04-25 22:50:00,7832, Thanks Corvy!!!  I sure was glad when they came by   Thanks Ryan!!!  I think the ice is a thing of the past now
576288,carll2,2011-04-26 01:46:00,443,"  not here lol...was out on the ice again this morning for specks n lakers...but it was my last time on the ice it was a little scary...the ice was turning black this afternoon, by saturday il be fishing out of a boat  i hope to see another report from you this weekend"
