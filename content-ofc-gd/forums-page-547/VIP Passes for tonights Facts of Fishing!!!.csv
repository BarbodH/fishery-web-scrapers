574920,danbouck,2011-04-21 17:23:00,4380,That would be easier than sneaking in the back door early. I'm there
574927,danklegrand,2011-04-21 17:45:00,55,"My girlfriend and I are both looking forward to the show tonight.  VIP passses to meet Dave would be awesome! However, being a new member to the board and limited passes, please give priority to the more ""senior"" (not meaning age...)  members and their families."
574930,Pikeslayer,2011-04-21 17:49:00,1443," Hey Southpaw, Note that TJ is drawing for names between 2:00 & 2:30 so you have a good shot based on the numbers who have expressed interest. BE SURE TO PM TJ YOUR PROPER NAME.  BTW, I would gladly forego a pass so a 'youngster' (definetly meaning age)   could attend.  TJ, a little far for me. Would you mind asking Mercer if he could stop by Streetsville on the way? Tons of room and refreshments in the garage.  Slayer"

576038,danklegrand,2011-04-25 12:21:00,55,"As a brief follow-up, I would like to say thank-you again to T.J for the VIP passes. We arrived plenty early and met The Urban Fisherman and some other members when we dropped off or food bank items and picked up our passes.  A short time later we were in a little room downstairs eating Subway subs and shaking hands with Dave Mercer, J.P DeRose and Paul Powis! The show was great!  All 3 guys put on an awesome seminar full of great tips and good laughs.  Took some pics from my phone, but none of them turned out nice enough to post.   It was entertaining and informative from start to finish, and a great way to kick off the long weekend!"
576080,TJQ,2011-04-25 14:31:00,7806,"Your very welcome! Dave supplied the passes, i told him next time i was gonna scalp them...."
576232,Gutpile,2011-04-25 23:23:00,27,Thanks again TJ.  My daughter and I had a great time.  It was nice to spend the night with the one best fishing partners a father could have.
