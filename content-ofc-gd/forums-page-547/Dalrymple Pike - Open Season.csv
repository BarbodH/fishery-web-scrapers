576423,Cosmos,2011-04-26 18:05:00,588," I think you can fish it all year around since last year, i was fishing Canal and Mitchel for pike this season already. I saw a lot of people fishing without any luck."
576522,Dave Bailey,2011-04-26 22:23:00,1641," You are correct, pike are open all year in Zone 17. I believe it's been going on for a few years now."
