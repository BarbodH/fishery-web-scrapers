576425,misfish,2011-04-26 18:12:00,29133,"Nice shooting fellas.Nice birds. I awoke to down pours like they said was going to happen. Decided to get some well deserved sleep. Decided also to spend the day with my mrs,s.Thunder and lightning and some good rain today in the Vaughan area."
576441,Beans,2011-04-26 19:33:00,3339,On my way back home from the hospital last week I decided to go north on Fife's Bay Road (north P'boro) just to see where it goes...had several turkeys fly across in front of me...  I guess you can't shoot them from the road...eh?
576460,misfish,2011-04-26 20:17:00,29133,"Chris.I always share with the owner of the property.This year, the first is his."
576461,misfish,2011-04-26 20:20:00,29133," Norm,sometimes the drivers door swings open and catch,s them just right.LOL  If anyone took me serious,give yer head a shake."
576471,walleyejigger,2011-04-26 20:51:00,876,"the past few years we've started to see quite a few turkeys around here just outside of sudbury, think most if not all are escappes though, wish we had enough of them for a season, would love to hunt in the spring"
576478,GBW,2011-04-26 21:01:00,8460,"two pages and not one 'gobbler' joke?  I got one...  sorry Brian, I HAD TO!!"
576867,basketclam,2011-04-27 21:23:00,115,"It's been five years in the making, but I finally got my first bird this morning.  Had a wonderful hunt over the past three days with one of my best buddies, and it was great to share the moment with him.  Had just enough time to snap a few photos before the skies opened up and absolutely drenched us.  Will try to add a photo, but not too savvy inserting photos into posts, so you'll have to bear (bare?) with me.  Files too big and I can't figure out Photobucket seems to be freezing up, so you'll just have to believe me.  19.5 lbs, beard just over 7 inches.  Pretty pleased with myself.  http://s1015.photobucket.com/albums/af274/basketclam/?action=view&current=IMG_0190.jpg  Picture added, if I figured it out?"
576870,NAW,2011-04-27 21:27:00,4022, Congrets man.  Sounds like a beuty bird!
576872,GBW,2011-04-27 21:46:00,8460,"on the photobucket site there is a spot that say's IMG Code, that is all you need to copy and paste to here.  "
576877,basketclam,2011-04-27 21:52:00,115,"Thanks for the tip.  What would you folks say is an ""average"" turkey in Ontario, in terms of size.  Haven't seen a lot shot, so I'd like to get an idea of a base line for me to compare to.  It'll help me decide how brag worthy my bird is!  Aside from the fact that the first one is always brag worthy, of course."
576879,PikeMolester,2011-04-27 22:01:00,428,"I ran one down on the highway! Just off the island of Montreal...I'm used to dodging deer,raccoon,skunk,fox,rabbit etc etc...but NEVER a freakin turkey!"
576885,misfish,2011-04-27 22:09:00,29133,"Thats one huge tom. Congrats. I dont know about average,as I harvest for meat. Be it a jake or a mature tom, even a hen in the fall.It all gets roasted.  Again ,congrats."
576242,misfish,2011-04-25 23:51:00,29133,"I know theres a few guys here that hunt ole Tom. Any success today? I got my stuff together and ready to head out in the early am. Thier calling for down pours. Lets hope it,s a bad call by the weatherman again."
576243,Rod Caster,2011-04-25 23:53:00,5784," None hunted, but I saw one on Hwy 69, 20kms out of Parry Sound. I didn't realize they were that far north. Will we see them in North Bay soon??  Good luck this year...I, as you, hope the rain is minimal... outdoor work sucks when you mix in 30mm of rain"
576246,misfish,2011-04-25 23:56:00,29133, Thier in the  Burks falls area.  Thanks
576247,Terry,2011-04-25 23:58:00,14456,I had to stop to let them cross the road yesterday just outside of beaverton
576252,irishfield,2011-04-26 00:10:00,26272,Nothing in the yard recently other than a lead filled porky...
576253,FisherMike,2011-04-26 00:11:00,108,"  Ive seen turkeys just ouside of Dryden.  I never thought they would be that far north, however I can't be sure that they werent escapees."
576254,ketchenany,2011-04-26 00:12:00,3229,"what were you doing in ""Beavertown""?"
576257,kickingfrog,2011-04-26 00:18:00,8333,Or the buggers are so full of tryptophan that they are sleeping it off.
576262,Terry,2011-04-26 00:34:00,14456, LOL
576279,richyb,2011-04-26 01:22:00,774,had a jake at 15 yards today but he was on the wrong side of the fence
576291,Michael_Brown,2011-04-26 02:10:00,411,Well there was at least one that made it to the table.  Saw 5 different toms by 8:30 am today.  Birds everywhere.   
576296,niagarasteelheader,2011-04-26 02:27:00,12,"Called in 3 hens a jake and a tom this morning, got busted by a hen and missed the tom... Was rather frustrating!! Alarm is set for 430 again, if its not raining I'll be out there to give'r another go, if its raining, sleep in then go catch some trout."
576321,EC1,2011-04-26 04:41:00,930,"Drove by some walking around just outside of Port Perry Sunday. Haven't hunted before, but definitely would like to know whether wild turkey is really all that much better."
576324,Sandbag,2011-04-26 04:57:00,533, Thats a fine looking bird there Michael  Cheers  Craig
576327,Jewelbee,2011-04-26 08:20:00,422,Congratulations Michael I see them all them almost every day in nice weather in farmers fields. Good Luck!
576333,turtle,2011-04-26 10:30:00,274,"Congrats on the bird. Heard 2 toms right at first light, didnt respond too much to my calls, one sounded close at one point but didnt see either.  1 hen came right in at 30 yards.  Coyote circled me at 75 yards.  Overall quiet where I hunted."
576341,NAW,2011-04-26 12:44:00,4022,Out all morning.  Didn't hear one goble.  Didn't even here another gun shot all day.  I alway here atleast 10 other gun shots in the morning.  Lots of hunters cars parked at the usual spots..  Something is up with the area I hunt
576342,KGuppy,2011-04-26 12:48:00,18,"I went out with my buddy yesterday and we got one tom, he hit the tom 60yards out."
576349,Fish Farmer,2011-04-26 14:01:00,2234,Go getem Brian. I wish I had more time from fishin. Perch Fest is on my plate.
576354,Twocoda,2011-04-26 14:14:00,4130,MisTom? MisHen? or maybe MisTurkey?...just a few suggestions Brian..  Good Luck and leave the red bandana at home
576380,Oggie,2011-04-26 16:44:00,588, Not according to the turkey's perspective!  Lots of gobbles but they left with their girlfriends and ignored my two foam ladies! Dan O.
576381,mpt,2011-04-26 16:46:00,158,Here's my hunt at http://drdownriveroutdoors.blogspot.com/
576391,skidoosafari,2011-04-26 17:02:00,46,"It is amazing how far north the turkeys have moved. We have them around our camp near Barrys Bay. No season there yet,maybe soon though"
576401,Spiel,2011-04-26 17:27:00,9065,"Well me buddy got one yesterday Brian, says if he gets another it's mine."
576414,Armz,2011-04-26 17:52:00,2,"Had a really short season, took only 45 minutes for this one and another tom to come running in. Heard quite a few shots in the morning and a lot of trucks parked around my area. Now I'm gonna try and call in another for my dad. "
