Right from the action, power, reel seat, fore grip, hook keeper, what guides you want and it goes on right to spiral wrapping and putting your name on the thing. There not cheap but it's fun to do.  Check it out,  http://www.kistlerrods.com/fishing-rod/   MTBF"
576438,Dan668,2011-04-26 19:26:00,1120,"Cool, too expensive though. You could get your own better custom built rod for cheaper. The warranty on the rod is a joke"
576462,MCTFisher9120,2011-04-26 20:23:00,3761," Really eh, too bad to hear about that. They must be awesome rods regardless if Gary Loomis has worked on them...Not for me but maybe somebody out there on OFC  Edit* I made a rod and at the end the price was 4 something...then a box popped up with a $140 discount...hmm lol"
576468,jedimaster,2011-04-26 20:43:00,3472,"Yikes, made a nice micro guide split handle frog rod 635 bucks. I think I would rather have two cumaras."
576487,asdve23rveavwa,2011-04-26 21:25:00,2690,"Built a musky rod for $395...definitely up there, fun to play around with anyways."
576500,Garry2Rs,2011-04-26 21:56:00,1425,"I started building rods this past winter down in Arizona...You know, something to do when it was too hot to go fishing. Anyway I was shocked to find that the COST of the rod parts could easily double when you started adding bits of ""eye-candy"" that only glamorized the basic rod.  Needless to say my rods feature basic black with a strand of pearls..."
576514,MCTFisher9120,2011-04-26 22:16:00,3761,I did a few bass rods in the 405-460 range...lot's of options but I don't get how having recoil guides adds $100 to the price vs the others. To the custom guys that build rods how expensive are the different guides on the market today?
