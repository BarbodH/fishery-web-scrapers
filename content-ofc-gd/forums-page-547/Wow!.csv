576734,jedimaster,2011-04-27 14:22:00,3472,"Really a great series, and the canucks deserved that win. Crawford stood on his head otherwise it would have been 5-1.To be honest it looked like Chicago missed Bickell, they didn't seem to have that gritty forecheck. Canucks played like they didn't have a bit of fear in them. Luoungo didn't win the game, but he didn't lose it, so i guess thats a start for him in the play offs."
576775,Dutchy,2011-04-27 17:32:00,416,"Canucks totally deserved it, but when they lost that late goal I did think here we go again. Great play by Burrows in OT, but really they should have closed the game out by the end of the second. No wonder Chicago let Niemi go when they knew Crawford was waiting in the wings.  All I need now is my Pens to do the same tonight"
576811,Abraxus,2011-04-27 19:05:00,104,"The Nucks are my team!  I live, eat and breath Canucks Hockey!  Last night was a total nail biter!  That game was perhaps one of the most amazing playoff games one could ever watch!  Whether you were a fan of either team or not.  Fast, furious, amazing hits, spectacular saves and all the drama one could ever handle.  In the end the better team prevailed.  Cory Crawford was absolutely astounding!  What a performance put forth by that young talent! We will certainly see and hear a lot more of him in years to come.  He was simply the only reason the Hawks had even the slightest chance last night!  As for all this nonsense about officiating, it goes both ways! Get over it and move on.  In previous games, the Nucks had plenty of reason to chirp aswell!  In the end, Vancouver gets to celebrate a much deserved victory and Chicago gets to work on their golf swing.  It could have just as easily have been Vancouver booking their tee off times today.  That's just the way the puck bounces in Playoff Hockey! Truly Amazing!!!!!  Ab"
575986,ctdd2006,2011-04-25 02:54:00,531,The gamble of benching Luongo didn't pay off!  Wow!  What now?  I picked the 'Nucks but am now second guessing that!
575987,dhickey,2011-04-25 03:02:00,1038,I thougt chicogo didnt stand a chance. after having to be dismanteld because of the sallery cap. i hope i was wrong. favorate teams. TORONTO CHICOGO BOSTON  GO CHICOGO GO BOSTON  LITE IT UP!!!
575994,BillM,2011-04-25 03:20:00,17367,Chicago can thank the post for being a game 7.
575995,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-04-25 03:27:00,0,A tight and lucky game like tonight is simply a reminder of why you can't throw 2 games away in the playoffs.  The 'nucks have made their bed....
576016,fish_fishburn,2011-04-25 10:58:00,1311,I always said Luongo is probably the most over rated goalie in the NHL. Vancouver is toast now that Chicago has got their number. Big changes coming to Van in the off season.
576029,lookinforwalleye,2011-04-25 11:50:00,4399,takes 4 to win a series!!!  Salty your killing me!
576037,Nipfisher,2011-04-25 12:10:00,2449,I'm not counting Vancouver out at home in Game 7. Luongo and the Sedins will play well enough to win. Chicago has grit but Van. will win the series.
576059,jedimaster,2011-04-25 13:48:00,3472,"Vancouver must be wanting to win especially bad at home in dramatic fashion, they have played terrible the last three games. Two tight losses in games 2 and 3, followed by two obliterations by chicago. Another tight  game last night. Chicago looked like they ran out of steam for a while in the third, but Vancouver just didn't have the horsepower to pull through. I am pulling for chicago, as I hate vancouver. Some great hockey being played by some players in Chicago. Some freaking pounding hits too.  I have a feeling like it Toews wasn't MIA this series would be long over with the 'nucks making tee times. Bickell, Bolland and Keith are the top player on the ice for chicago right now. Even Hossa is playing well."
576064,Dan668,2011-04-25 14:02:00,1120,"Vancouver has it, chicago didn't play good yesterday, got lucky with 2 misplays with the goalie. Well see.."
576072,jedimaster,2011-04-25 14:19:00,3472,"bickells goal was a solid goal, good forecheck and a thundering hit by bolland, and bickell roofed it. the other was a bad play by the goalie but the strong forecheck opened up bolland, the breakaway goal was nice, and luongo coughed up a bad rebound for the fourth. Vancouver has to put someone in net and whoever it is can't play crappy like either of those two... who do you all think will start game 7. I don't think they can really afford to shelter Loungo. but it sure seems like the backup is going to start."
576302,dhickey,2011-04-26 02:59:00,1038, go who ?  CHICAGO!!!  say it.!  they will do it.  say it.!   
576356,Flappn,2011-04-26 14:47:00,245,Hawks Hawks Hawks. Tonight will be a very interesting game!
576374,Dutchy,2011-04-26 16:28:00,416,"Don't count out Vancouver, well not until they are 4 goals down early in the second............"
576388,ADB,2011-04-26 16:57:00,444,"Hopefully this game tonight doesn't disappoint.  Either way, a great team will be advancing to the semis."
576394,jedimaster,2011-04-26 17:06:00,3472,"I would like Boston and Chicago to win so I am not forced to root for either canadian team that I don't give a rats ass about... Remember when the Sen's were ""Canada's team"" hahaha"
576395,DRIFTER_016,2011-04-26 17:07:00,10439,The Canucks are just lulling the Hawks into a false sense of security.
576405,jedimaster,2011-04-26 17:34:00,3472," I think you have mistaken that just a tad... ""they are lulling the Canucks fans into a deep coma"""
576470,walleyejigger,2011-04-26 20:49:00,876," nobody's forcing u to cheer for anyone, feel free to cheer for any ""american team"", if u can find one, you must of misspoke, im pretty sure if u check the rosters, boston's one of the most ""canadian"" teams around, not so much for vancouver or montreal.  so i think what you meant to say was ""I hope Vancouver or Montreal wins"" i'm sure the teams appreciate ur support and so do the rats ass'"
576492,jedimaster,2011-04-26 21:35:00,3472,"Well, I was rooting for Chicago, cause I know a guy that plays for them. but he just got put for surgery so he will miss the rest of the season. Oh well. I guess I have to keep rooting for them."
576494,snoil,2011-04-26 21:41:00,139,MIMICO.BOLLAND.HAWKS.ENOUGH SAID.
576503,Rod Caster,2011-04-26 21:59:00,5784,"  American teams are in the USA, Canadian teams are in Canada. I can't believe I had to type that."
576535,walleyejigger,2011-04-26 23:00:00,876," but you do feel FORCED to cheer for teams playing in a sport, you did type that"
576550,Rod Caster,2011-04-26 23:23:00,5784," It wasn't me that wrote ""I feel forced"" and I definitly DON'T feel forced, but I do prefer cheering for teams that are located in Canadian cities. It means more for the country and we can cheer for our canadian teams together in the playoffs. 6 canadian teams versus 24 american teams = underdogs. Trying to attract talent in cold canadian cities versus balmy climates = underdogs. Balance book and tv ratings pressure from an american commisioner versus Canadian heritage= underdogs. Canadian cities are at a disadvantage in the NHL so I feel that any support is self serving for our country.  ...off topic... so.... GO CANUCKS GO!!! As somebody already said, if they get knocked out, expect big changes for next year."
576663,DRIFTER_016,2011-04-27 05:12:00,10439, Told ya!!!!
576664,tb4me,2011-04-27 05:16:00,3295,Awesome game boys!! GO NUCKS GO!!!
