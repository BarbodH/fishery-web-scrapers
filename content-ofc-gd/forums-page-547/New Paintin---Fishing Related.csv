576222,mercman,2011-04-25 23:01:00,7054," My grandparents had a farm up in Shawville Que.About 1/2 mile from the farm was one of those old bridges you talk about.So narrow, that we would have to listen for cars coming down the gravel road,so we could get off the bridge before they got there. I would go and sit on that bridge with my Gramps, and he would whistle as we sat there and fished little brook trout. Ahh yes, those summer days were the best Dang, i got all misty there for a minute."
576234,bushart,2011-04-25 23:26:00,2628,Thanks again all  Mercman--not far from Shawville (bout an hour-Ontario side) I used to fish a creek where I would drop my line between the logs of the bridge topside---catch tiny specks---they could'nt see ya that way.  man life used to be so simple and fun then.
