576942,spinnerbaitking,2011-04-28 00:51:00,1622,"Started out this morning wondering about the weather, not looking good but I said lets go anyway, Randy meets me at 9am I load my stuff into his boat & off to the Baie, as we arrive it looking very dark so we decide to wait a few minutes or 30, after the thunder moves on & the rain lets up a bit, we launch the boat & off we go very little wind & nobody else around, started throwing Spinnerbaits, Swimbaits, Jerkbaits & Crankbaits with only one follow, we decide to head for the outflow at Bruce A, started throwing a small X-Rap Jerkbait & wham I'm into a 3.5lb Brown, my 1st in about 20 yrs after 1/2 an hour with nothing else I switch baits & land 3 more Browns a 1.5, 2.5 & a 6.2lber, by now the wind is blowing pretty good & we decide to head back into the Baie, as we get closer to the rock shoal we need to go around to get back to shore, we are looking at 3 footers with white caps coming off shore, man did we get wet, but it was well worth it, biggest Brown was 22 3/4"" not big enough to help Team #10 out but a real nice fighter SBK Back at it tomorrow I hope come on Pike "
