576568,Bob Devine,2011-04-27 00:25:00,251,"Well the Detroit River is starting to heat up and limits of walleyes are coming to the boats. Depsite the wind, rain and waves the walleye fishing is picking up after a slow start mainly because of the weather. N and E winds have kept the Ont side of the DR muddy and little to no fishing has taken place on our side this spring. Walleyes are being caught be jiggers using 1/2-3/4 oz jigs, most using chartruese with a variety of plastic minnows or worms (Gulp and FINS) seem to be favourites around here. Most of the action is happening in the mid river section across from Lasalle Ont. Anglers are fishing channel edges in 12-30 fow keeping their baits as vertical as possible. Here are a few from today. "
