576315,chilli,2011-04-26 04:01:00,199,They are trouble for our fishery. The shores used to get covered three feet thick when the die offs occured and they had to stock salmon just to control em. You can't use them as bait dead or alive in Lakes that don't have them because they spread like gobies and zebra muscles. Take as many as you can. Check the guide to eating sport fish though
574012,marrex_mike,2011-04-19 05:31:00,40,last night was a full moon and the temp is going up with the rain that we had so I think they will come soon I us dont know about simcoe because it wasn't to good to me last year only got 3/4 of a pail so if anyone can help out with a good spot other than simcoe please PM me>> thanxx  
574014,Joeytier,2011-04-19 06:31:00,3990,The full moon was helpful  Go get em while they're hot!
574219,marrex_mike,2011-04-19 20:12:00,40,where r they hot?
574324,Sinker,2011-04-20 00:23:00,8692,"My smelt spot is just as sacred as my best brookie lake. There is no chance I'm gonna spill the beans. Put your time in searching, and waiting for them, getting wet, windblown, and cold.......then come on here and tell me your spot.  Thats what I thought LOL  S."
574350,Nipfisher,2011-04-20 01:04:00,2449, In the stream that flows into the lake    Seriously we are in North Bay so our spots don't help you. Take the drive to Magnetewan and you'll do well when they run.
574386,Dara,2011-04-20 02:30:00,3052,"    Sorry guys. I figured my location would explain it. Harmony creek runs into lake Superior about 30 miles north of the Sault. There are plenty of places for smelts around here. We have lake Huron, St Joeseph island has a few creeks they run in earlier and lots up on Superior. You can follow them as they run. Huron first then Superior a week later"
574796,BucktownAngler,2011-04-21 09:17:00,582,"Just got in from a excellent night of smelting with Mr. Mike.  We hit up one of our favourite honey holes on Simcoe. We didnt get out there until after midnight...The first couple hours was very slow, we only managed to get about 15-20 smelts.  After 3am, the smelt run was ON!! It was amazing, we ran out of buckets, we had to use a milk crate with a net inside. We never expected this at all. Some big boys in there too  Get them while they're hot      "
574803,Big Cliff,2011-04-21 10:51:00,6899,"  So, I have to ask, WHAT THE HECK ARE YOU GOING TO DO WITH THAT MANY SMELTS? That is just plain nuts! By the time you get finished cleaning them they would be mush, you could never eat that many smelts, why would anyone take more than they can use? No wonder our fisheries end up in trouble!"
574807,Rod Caster,2011-04-21 11:23:00,5784,"  He could be sharing with family members and there may have been 10 of them out there. Smelt have no limits and are orginally an invasive species. Smelt caused havoc on the Eerie fishery in the early 1900's and contributed to the loss of the Blue Walleye.With all the smelt, whities, gobies and other baitfish in Simcoe...I think the fishery will survive.  Nice haul Boss, that one is a hog! hahaha good luck cleaning them all."
574822,BucktownAngler,2011-04-21 12:55:00,582," Thanks Rod Caster, and yes youre right. There were a few of us out there, we will be sharing these and eating them as well as using for bait."
574829,Thrasher,2011-04-21 13:14:00,39,"Beauty haul!!! we got lucky and did Ok last night, but the full run has yet to happen. Won't be long! Nice work waiting it out! Awesome when the hard work pays off!"
574831,lew,2011-04-21 13:18:00,12766,"Congrats Boss, looks like you guys had a fantastic night out there.  Brings back great memories from years ago when myself, dad, brother and friends used to head to Lake Ontario and come home with a couple pails of smelt. We'd all head back to Dad's place for a huge late night/early morning feed of those tasty little treats !!  Thanks for the fond memories"
574895,Nipfisher,2011-04-21 16:23:00,2449,"Big Cliff. Not sure when you last cleaned smelts but they're not that hard. If you just cut off the heads and slit the belly to scoop ot each one takes less then 10 seconds.  Cormorants don't care how many they eat?  Nice haul guys. Never considered staying out till 3am. Hmmmm?  Mr. Mike...are you gonna post the location of your ""honey hole"" for all to see?"
574900,crappieperchhunter,2011-04-21 16:34:00,2582,"No way no now I would EVER keep that many..gotta take Big Cliffs side on that issue...but I am very envious of your catch, particularly the size of the smelt. Looks like that would have been a blast."
575325,marrex_mike,2011-04-22 21:45:00,40,"mmmmmm!! gotta love smelt on good friday!! Today is the best day of the year, a day that all we eat is fish! I love it and the smelts add a nice touch. Also in response to the post about my honey hole it's on the south side of simcoe in a town called Sutton right at jacksons point! Ive been going there for years but this was the motherload!! There are a few spots to fish from just drive along the lake and you should find something. Smelts are really hit or miss so if you head out GOOD LUCK!! the run was early in the morning for us so put the work in and you should do fine. Also about the amount we took from the lake i'd like to say that that wasn't even a dent in the smelt population or the run... and not only do we share our catch with our families and friends but what we do keep must last us all year long so if we had another bucket with us I would have filled that to!"
575327,Live2fish85,2011-04-22 21:53:00,1633,Just wondering if you guy know any spots on Lake Erie between Port Dover and Dunnville that I may be able to catch some not asking for any hot spots I just have neve went out for smelts. Any help would be great.  Chris
575330,aniceguy,2011-04-22 21:56:00,1094,"Dara I just ate some the other day from that creek, I swear there is not much better then some smelt...Bill Are you mad Pike bait, some corn flour in hot oil, thier value is far greater as good eats"
575346,marrex_mike,2011-04-22 22:56:00,40,sorry Ive never tried catchin them out that way port dover is far from us.. I here the smelts have a good run out that way but I've never been.
575434,niagarasteelheader,2011-04-23 04:32:00,12,"I don't know about any spots up that way but Minor's fishmarket in Port C. had bags of smelts for a $1 each. Looked like a couple pounds per bag too, lotta smaller looking ones but hey if ya can't fish for em its always an option."
575646,walleyejack,2011-04-24 00:28:00,358," I got 6 qt baskefull of them,  yummmmy"
575680,BillM,2011-04-24 01:54:00,17367,"  Milo, I can't eat them, so bait it is!!!  lol!   Although I'm sure if I got a few, the oldman would fry some up."
575836,Sinker,2011-04-24 19:10:00,8692,Those are nice big smelts! Nice work! Told ya you had to stick it out  S.
575870,Rod Caster,2011-04-24 22:03:00,5784,"they've slowed down, or completely shut down in the North Bay area. It was a short season this year. I've have about 10 meals in the freezer, that'll do for me."
575906,aniceguy,2011-04-24 23:52:00,1094,"thats right Bill I always forget that, ok you catch em for bait I ll eat em"
576314,rdambros,2011-04-26 03:45:00,71,"I was thinking of trying smelt fishing for the first time this weekend. I was thinking of going to Jackson's Point with some family and friends. Do you think this weekend, April 29 or 30 would still have a run of smelt???? Thanks for any information/advice."
571476,marrex_mike,2011-04-12 15:57:00,40,Does anyone know where I could do some smelt fishing or if there even running??
571482,Joeytier,2011-04-12 16:06:00,3990,A general location might help...  I'm going to look tonight.  Haven't come across any yet.
571484,Nipfisher,2011-04-12 16:11:00,2449,They won't run around here (North Bay) until the end of April. Joey and Chad (Rod Caster) we should get together and go smelting one night. I know of a few places.
571488,marrex_mike,2011-04-12 16:17:00,40,I usually go to simcoe for smelts but i would like to try some new spots. I have a group of guys that i usually go with and they would be happy to hear of a place that will produce smelts for once..  
571493,BucktownAngler,2011-04-12 16:55:00,582,Im also interested....I also usually go to the Simcoe area
571498,Bondar,2011-04-12 16:58:00,817,"   you and 100,000 other people would like  to know this too ! please guys lets hear them spots"
571499,blaque,2011-04-12 16:59:00,2419,Lower niagara was very productive last year. We did well the week prior to easter sunday.
571503,Dara,2011-04-12 17:16:00,3052,Harmony creek is always good
571521,Rod Caster,2011-04-12 18:43:00,5784,"  I was thinking that as well.  I checked two nights ago...water way too high right now, wait for the drop and bingo. I give it two weeks at most.  PM me Blair.. I've got some good spots, so I wonder if they match yours.  Joey, wanna get together this year? I just bought me a new net!"
571645,BillM,2011-04-13 00:28:00,17367,"I would really appreciate anyone in the Simcoe area giving me a heads up..  I've never fished for smelt, but I could use a dozen or so for spring pike!"
571647,Joeytier,2011-04-13 00:31:00,3990,"Sounds good.  I was scooping them out this time last year, but it was a far earlier spring I suppose."
571930,marrex_mike,2011-04-13 20:37:00,40,"thanks for all the tips guys... also i'd like to know where is harmony creek Ive never heard of it??  I usually go to jacksons point but it's been crappy there for the last few years, and same goes for the oro side of the lake... thats why I want to try somewhere other than simcoe."
573162,fishboy,2011-04-17 03:26:00,550,Haliburton runs are starting so I hear
573166,Sinker,2011-04-17 03:58:00,8692,"Anyone getting any? I got a few tues/wed night, but friday night was the best run so far.  S."
573348,johnnyb,2011-04-17 18:32:00,3413,I've heard Haliburton is doing really well...11pm seems to be the ticket....and Huntsville area too  
573416,marrex_mike,2011-04-17 22:55:00,40,where in Haliburton are we talking about?? I have never been up that way for them.. I went to simcoe last night and drove all the way around NONE!
573476,fisher12,2011-04-18 01:21:00,81,"I googled Harmony Creek and this is what I came up with, that its in oshawa?"
573486,Sinker,2011-04-18 02:02:00,8692,"You won't get them driving around!!!  I fished for 5 hours friday night. In 3 hours I had nothing. From 1030 till 1130 I hauled them, after that nothing again.  You just gotta stick it out in one spot, they will come, its that time of year.  S."
573495,Oggie,2011-04-18 02:49:00,588,Does the Upper Ottawa River have smelt? Mattawa Area. Just curious.  Dan O.
573502,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-04-18 03:33:00,0,nothing worse than cleaning a 5 gallon pail when you're hungover!  i just try and steal a feed and a pack for the freezer these days...
573545,marrex_mike,2011-04-18 12:51:00,40,"where were you when u stuck it out?? when I drove around simcoe checking spots there was nobody to be found, I was out there solo..lol I did run into 2 guys packing up at jacksons point around 11pm that was it.  "
573553,Rod Caster,2011-04-18 13:11:00,5784," I'd like to know as well. I don't think the Ottawa has runs, but some of the nearby, larger lakes might have them."
573690,Thrasher,2011-04-18 18:36:00,39,"I don't believe the ottawa has a run. There's been nothing in my neck of the woods yet. I may go and check some temps tonight to see how far away the run is. Getting much warmer in the next few days, won't be long!"
573691,Thrasher,2011-04-18 18:38:00,39,"Blair, do you come down this way to your ""secret spots"" or do you stay up there?"
573952,Nipfisher,2011-04-19 02:01:00,2449, I PMd you.
