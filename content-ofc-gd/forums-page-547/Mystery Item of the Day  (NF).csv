576947,HTHM,2011-04-28 01:04:00,4082,I always wondered why they put so much engineering into a one use item?

576984,grt1,2011-04-28 02:00:00,638,you better give those guys on Canadian Pickers a call if you got more stuff to get rid of. might make a buck or two
576622,Sherriff,2011-04-27 02:24:00,252,"Anyone have any clue what this item is?  It's been in my garage for years now (12) and was in my grand parents garage since I can remember.  Made in England, has air connections and gas burner and a gas type connection.  Here is the complete item all together    Here is the base with a burner in it    Inside Base showing burner    Here is the inside portion, top removed and pulled out of the base    Close up of the gauge    Another gauge shot    Thanks for any info on it...  Sherriff"
576624,Pikeslayer,2011-04-27 02:31:00,1443,Steralizing device perhaps?
576625,pikeguy,2011-04-27 02:32:00,195,my guess would be and old style tiger torch !?
576628,Nipfisher,2011-04-27 02:36:00,2449,Like an industrial pressure cooker. The burner heats the liquid or material inside. The big valve on top locks down the lid and the pressure can be observed using the guage. My guess is the air hook-ups allow for safe release of the pressure? Any chance it was off of a train..or from a factory? Looks like a piece to a much bigger machine.
576631,mercman,2011-04-27 02:44:00,7054,something to produce and collect steam for a clothing manufacturer's press or a cleaning company?
576632,Sherriff,2011-04-27 02:45:00,252,"I think Pikeslayer has it.  Thanks.  Either an Autoclave or a Steam Digester for sterilizing.  Possibly dental equipment.  Now, trying to find a similar picture online to date it..    Sherriff"
576634,hammercarp,2011-04-27 02:48:00,964,Vul. Point- Vulcanising Point - some sort of pressure cooker for vulcanising rubber. That is my guess.

576651,DRIFTER_016,2011-04-27 03:49:00,10439,You guys are all wrong!!! It's obviously a Flux Capacitor!!!!
576652,Dave Bailey,2011-04-27 03:55:00,1641," Correct, used in emergencies to fire an inverse tachyon pulse through the main deflector array. It destabilises the surrounding subspace field and prevents a warp core breach."
576654,DRIFTER_016,2011-04-27 03:59:00,10439, Right!!!! Some people these days are just unedumacated pions.
576658,Dutchy,2011-04-27 04:13:00,416,Looks like an autoclave to me.  I didn't see sherriff's post before I posted. We have autoclaves at work.
576681,tjsa,2011-04-27 11:17:00,1578," Uhh.......dat's ""peon's"""
576709,Sherriff,2011-04-27 12:57:00,252,Thanks for all the input folks.  Sorry no prize.  Just my thanks.  LOL  Sherruff
576743,Dara,2011-04-27 16:18:00,3052,"In your granparents garage, now in yours for 12 years, and you don't know what it is.  Does the term ""hoarder"" mean anything to you?"
576755,Sherriff,2011-04-27 16:42:00,252,"Ha ha, far from it.  Just was hidden for many years and now must go.  Sherriff"
576766,Harrison,2011-04-27 17:13:00,2202,I am sure someone here will take it off your hands and turn it into a smoker.
576806,johnnyb,2011-04-27 18:53:00,3413,"   Not only has it been in there for years....but there's so much other stuff it hasn't been visible until now!  You need to learn the term ""hoarder"" as well as ""denial""  "

576860,mercman,2011-04-27 20:55:00,7054,"i wouldnt be playin around with that thing too much, or you wont have any trouble getting it OUT of your basement"
576924,greenfshrmn,2011-04-28 00:17:00,65,Not sure...but it looks like it could be converted to the world's fastest lead melting pot for jigs.
