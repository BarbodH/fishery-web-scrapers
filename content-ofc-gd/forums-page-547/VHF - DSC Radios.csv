575462,spincast,2011-04-23 13:39:00,3279,"So, as someone who just got into big lake fishing last year when I picked up my 16fter, I figured getting a VHF radio would be a good idea, and the DSC calling feature seemed to be a really good idea.  Spring fishing show - radioworld special. Ask for some details and advice, end up with a Standard Horizon Eclipse DSC GX 1000S. about $100.00 bucks then I buy an antenna (actually 2, cause after trying the 8 ft on my boat it was just not going to work -see classifieds section). Another $100+. Then I drop $80.00 on the license to operate the radio (ROM-C) that you can only get through your Power Squadron.  The radio course spends a fair bit of time discussing the DCS features and mentions the difference between SC 101 versus the D and makes it sound like a very viable option for us pleasure boaters and anglers who want to be safe and economical. At no point was there any discussion regarding some recent changes with regards to the SC 101 type of radio Well, I just came across this little piece of information from another website:(from the US Coast Guard) DSC-Equipped Marine Radios Must Meet More Rigorous Technical Standards Beginning March 25, 2011 ***                  "
575471,bigugli,2011-04-23 14:22:00,6138,"You bought a radio from a Canadian retailer, for user in Canada, took a course for certification in Canada.  American regs do not apply in Canadian waters. Same reason a camouflage pattern Mustang suit is not approved in Canada. Different regulations. Unless you are boating primarily in the U.S. I don't see the problem."
575493,spincast,2011-04-23 15:40:00,3279,"Well, a few reasons: 1 there is obviously a safety reason why the US Coast Guard banned the radios, and I bought the radio primarily for safety purposes, although finding out whats working on any gioven day maybe a bit of a bonus too. So, IMO, it would be nice to have those limitations explained to me up front , especially by the authority that licenses individuals to operate them; 2 - the DSC system is a global satelite safety system, and the satelites that support it are owned, partly, by the US. So if the largest US safety overseer, which is an arm of the US government bans theses specific radios, it does beg a question or two about their future viability, opening the possibility that other jurisdictions will follow suit, especially the one which shares the largest amount of border with it food for thought for those considering a purchase in the near future... 3 - this implies that in the not too distant future we can also expect difficulty in getting support for parts and warranty - if the radios aren't made or sold anymore, they become disposable, not repairable. 4 - In several locations the difference between the US and Canada is insignificant distance wise - so for instance, lets say you fish the Niagara River, have a NY fishing permit and you buy a radio which is legal in Canada and want to be able to fish off the bar or in the US side drifts. You may not be able to get a US licence for your SC 101 radio, especially if you are apllying for your first licence, after the March 2011 date. Ditto the Detroit river, and those who hop over the bridge(s) to fish. So now what do you do with the radio? Leave it in and fish anyway, opening yourself up to possible fines and legal ramifications? Take it out when you fish these areas?   Like the rivers we fish, the implications run deeper than the surface appearance. The point of my rant was the fact that at no point was I notified of this."
575815,superdad,2011-04-24 17:33:00,353,I don't believe the DSC feature is working on the Great Lakes as yet. It's supposed to come along some time. I've had my VHF with DSC for five years. You must register your boatname and get a MMSC(i think) number.  It's been five years sonce the radio course and things do change and things to work somethime. The DSC feature is agood emergency situation assist.  Hope the Great Lakes get hooked up soon.  Just a comment  David  aka  Superdad
576352,POLLIWOGG,2011-04-26 14:07:00,835,"I talked to our instructor last night and he tells me that dsc has been up for 3 years.  Lots of false alarms, so guys stop pushing that red button to see if it works."
