576403,bobowski,2011-04-26 17:32:00,360,"I was cleanning out my garage the other day and I stumbled apon my Banjo Fishing System that I purchased around 15 years ago. Most of the contents are still there. I think I only used it a few times. I still have the video that came with it too. They really did a good job selling these lures on the infommercial. I remember watching it and thinking ""man I have to have this"". Does anyone still use these lures? Has anyone had success with it? I'm thinking about bringing it out for bass season."
576446,Terry,2011-04-26 19:46:00,14456,I still might have them kicking around  my wife saw it on TV and figured I just had to have it........  I don't think I ever even to it fishing with me
576448,johnnyb,2011-04-26 19:49:00,3413,I never had the whole kit....but had a 5 or 6-pack....looking at the minnows themselves...they should work as a swimbait...action is decent...but can't say I've ever used the ones I have

576465,jedimaster,2011-04-26 20:35:00,3472,My brother bought me a big jumbo pack for xmas. The instructional dvd it came with is hillarious.I think I may even have to try them out.
576495,lookinforwalleye,2011-04-26 21:45:00,4399,Maybe we should have a fish off between the banjo minnow and the Hannon snake system!!!
576501,jedimaster,2011-04-26 21:56:00,3472,hmm...
576508,Garry2Rs,2011-04-26 22:08:00,1425,"One of my repeat clients is still only about 7years old. Last year he showed up with a Banjo Minnow outfit his Mom had given him.  We rigged up a fairly large one and before I could get his Dad set-up, with a Senko, the little guy had a nice Bass in the boat. "
576513,Big Cliff,2011-04-26 22:16:00,6899,"LOL, I bought one, all my buddies bought one, I don't think any of us ever did catch a fish with them. I think I still have a full kit that I bought for a friend but never did give it to him since it didn't seem to work.  I think it was kind of like the ""pet rock"" thing when it came out, good marketing!"
576538,Afraz,2011-04-26 23:04:00,250," Was it just me, or was there line coming off the spool from the guy working the minnow (the first image of the dude reeling it in) Lol prob got a birdsnest from chucking that dinky light weight banjo minnow..."
576564,muskymike,2011-04-27 00:02:00,772,"I too was  one that bought the kit. Had a few that we sold in my parents store back in the day.  They do actually work. Both for Pike, Smallmouth and Largemouth. The rattles dont do anything, but the standard med sized minnow was incredibly effective on Gbay."
576699,corvette1,2011-04-27 12:09:00,1765,my 16lb walleye was cought on a banjo minnow from quinte i use them all the time jiging
576785,jedimaster,2011-04-27 18:07:00,3472,The very first reel shot in the video does have a birds nest for sure. But don't worry he is using a wavespin. He can cast with the birdsnest no problem.
576793,Freshtrax,2011-04-27 18:33:00,2215,Hey guys keep quiet about my top secret simcoe laker bait.  Realy through the ice thre my go to bait of choice.  The blue silver large one riged on a light jig head and a stinger in the tail.
576823,mbosh1980,2011-04-27 19:28:00,349,The banjo weed guards looks suspiciously like the elastics my dentist used to put on my braces to torture me fix my teeth. Weird how soft swimbaits are all the rage now...everything comes back in style!
576829,Rattletrap2,2011-04-27 19:42:00,1652,"I have no problem with the Banjo Minnow or the Flying Lures (I actually have the Flying Lures) but the one that really gets me is when Ol' Roland Martin sold off every last bit of pride and self respect to flog the ""Helicopter Lures""!! I mean, can it get much lower? I mean even Bill Dances ""Dances Eel"" or Doug Hannon's ""Snake"" leave some pride intact!  What was the name of the guy that did the PBS show ""Streamside""? He promoted the Flying Lures quite a bit back in the late 70's and early 80's. I liked his show when he fished small streams and rivers in Upstate New York from his canoe. Oh, I remember now...Don Meissner!!  ""Rod and Real"" with Bill Saiff was another classic on PBS around the same time!"
576869,Kerry,2011-04-27 21:27:00,383,"I was going to chime in and say the Helicopter Lure from Roland Martin.Funny thing is my buddy and I caught some huge slop bass in bass lake that year with them but then they kinda fell by the wayside.Definately smelled like plastisol coming out of the package,that was probably why we stopped using them. Kerry"
576878,PikeMolester,2011-04-27 21:56:00,428,I have a full kit...Never used it last year.
576882,danbouck,2011-04-27 22:07:00,4380,My dad had the kit and I caught a 4lber on it a long time ago
576912,Afraz,2011-04-27 23:21:00,250, Doesn't look like any wave-spin i have XD
