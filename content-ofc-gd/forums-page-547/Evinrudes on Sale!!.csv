576457,bushart,2011-04-26 20:03:00,2628,I actually own something like that in pretty mint shape  My father in law bought one new in about 55--used it twice---now I have it wrapped in plastic.
576458,mercman,2011-04-26 20:03:00,7054, Thats great AND you can pay in installments. Oh how the times have changed.
576463,fishnsled,2011-04-26 20:27:00,3520,2 models with FULL REVERSE!! WHOO HOO!! 	Great find TJ.
576464,jedimaster,2011-04-26 20:34:00,3472,What is partial reverse? Is that where you have to take the motor off the bracket and point it backwards?
576466,walleyejigger,2011-04-26 20:40:00,876,"having one of those mint, is prolly worth more than a new current model."
576479,Billy Bob,2011-04-26 21:01:00,5865, Don't know how much they are worth now.....BUT for my money I'll take a newer models since I remember them B A S T A R D S....LOL......spent more time trying to get them started and keep them running then fishing....LOL....those were the days I want to forget....
