I had 2 in the boat last year and just hooked it up to one then the other once the other was dead. Is this how to do it? What kind of wire should I use to hook them up to the terminals and what battery does the trolling motor clips go to if it matters?  Thanks guys...getting everything prepared and ready for summer, can't wait!  MTBF  If it matter's it's a 12v 30lb. 2 seems like alot for a 12' boat but it works for me"
576735,HTHM,2011-04-27 14:22:00,4082,"That is not how you do it, that will give you 24 volts to the motor. To get 12 volts, simply jump positive to positive and negative to negative."
576736,bubbles,2011-04-27 14:25:00,591,"Nope, that will give you 24V as the picture says, you need to wire in parallel not series.  Read this http://www.nyc-arecs.org/Connecting_Batteries_and_Chargers_in_Series_and_Parallel.pdf"
576737,DanD,2011-04-27 14:33:00,2223,Like this for 12 volts.  Dan.

576739,Sinker,2011-04-27 15:44:00,8692,You can get the proper cable to attach them at CT in the car audio section. The bigger the better. The second pic is the way.  S.
576741,MCTFisher9120,2011-04-27 16:16:00,3761," Thanks Dan, that was my assumption, I'll have a look at cdn tire."
576782,jedimaster,2011-04-27 17:53:00,3472,"Just an FYI as far as I know it when you charge them you have to be careful.  If the batteries are both new, and equal capacity its usually safe to charge them in parralel circuits, if they are different, or one is older than the other you should charge them seperatley. Otherwise you can end up overcharging one of them possibly leading to damage or explosion etc...."
576786,fishnsled,2011-04-27 18:15:00,3520,This cable has worked well for me the past couple of years. Cable

576813,MCTFisher9120,2011-04-27 19:12:00,3761," I won't charge them together, not sure about gas motors and alternators in them but I'm finding a used one ranging from a 6hp-15hp 2 stroke. Maybe next year I'll get a little on board charger and will learn more on the in boat charging but for now I'll do them separately.  The 2008 Battery says 650 Marine Cranking Amps/130min reserve capacity The 2010 Battery(same make and model) says 625 Marine Cranking Amps/125min reserve capacity.  Not sure why they are different, both are the same size, the older one has a material strap while the new battery has a hard plastic handle.  And fishnsled I like the look of that wire, I'll investigate them soon!  MTBF"
576816,MCTFisher9120,2011-04-27 19:14:00,3761," LOL, glad somebody said something. The image belongs to google but it was the best example I could find....dam uncle said ""ya that will work"" i gave him a good yelling at when I found out it would of blew it to pieces haha"
576819,Terry,2011-04-27 19:22:00,14456,don't know if it has been said but batteries in parallel are only as strong as the weakest battery  which means if one battery has less power then the other hooked together they will only charge to the strength of the weakest one so in most cases you are better off disconnecting the battery you run down from trolling and just connect to the second battery the math says that will give the longest run time
576861,jedimaster,2011-04-27 20:57:00,3472,"x2 on terry's suggestion, Get a better selector switch with a voltage meter and hook up the onboard charger to it as well and you are off to the races."
576906,GoneFishin,2011-04-27 23:12:00,349,"If your tight on cash Mike you could always hit up princes auto and pick up some wire, terminals and fuse for pretty cheap. It's only 12volt, you shouldn't need anything heavy duty..."
576921,danbouck,2011-04-28 00:10:00,4380,"A 30# Minn Kota will draw 30Amps on the highest speed, you better have some good wire if you don't want to smell burning"
576922,BillM,2011-04-28 00:11:00,17367,Don't they teach you that in college?   :)
576961,vinnimon,2011-04-28 01:32:00,2593," Thats a 24 volt set up, for a 12 vlt 2 battery set up. pos to pos, neg to neg.  10 g wire and a 30 amp resetuble fuse should suffice."
577012,Sinker,2011-04-28 02:32:00,8692,A set of cheap booster cables will work for ya too Mike. Just hook the batts up and away you go.  S.
