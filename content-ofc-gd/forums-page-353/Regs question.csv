743090,hombres4,2012-11-10 20:08:00,10,"Hi  there I am fishing a Huron trib that is not mentioned in the regs. How far upriver can I fish, for how long, what is open? We caught a coho and a rainbow and released both today. Thanks very much, I find them somewhat confusing because we are new to this river fishing."
743091,wallacio,2012-11-10 20:17:00,475,Some Huron/GB tribs are listed on pages 2 and 3 here.  http://www.mnr.gov.on.ca/stdprodconsume/groups/lr/@mnr/@letsfish/documents/document/mnr_e001335.pdf  Others have specific maps that outline the extended/year-round seasons:  http://www.mnr.gov.on.ca/en/Business/LetsFish/2ColumnSubPage/198482.html
743093,kickingfrog,2012-11-10 20:26:00,8333,"Generally the Great Lakes regs stop at the river mouth. Some of the rivers will have a sign stating were the river ""starts"" and the lakes ""ends"". Sometimes a prominent landmark is used to define where the Lake/River boundary is. Check the exceptions for the river you are fishing and there might be a mention of the delineation point and/or extended seasons."
743094,Woodsman,2012-11-10 20:30:00,1286,Unless noted by the Ministry once you are further inland than the lake shore you are not on Lake Huron and in Zone 16 most likely. Zone 16 seasons are in affect. The Ministry site has detailed maps of zone boundaries. Zone Boundries

743136,Canuck2fan,2012-11-11 03:42:00,1444,If you would have posted the name of the trib it would be easy to help you.... Of course if you were fishing illegally then it wouldn't look too good either LOL.

743219,kemper,2012-11-11 20:55:00,2232,"Do yourself a favour - read the regs BEFORE you head out. If you can't figure it out, then don't fish.  If I remember correctly the Huron tribs don't have an ""all waters"" clause like zone 17 does.  Trout closes Sept. 30, and unless the creek you were fishing was listed in the exceptions you were out-of-season. That's bad, don't do that."
