744061,aplumma,2012-11-14 20:19:00,6896,We have the snakehead in one of the local rivers I fish and I have caught and eaten a few of them. They are a firm fleshed fish that is light and white in color. The truth is it does resemble chicken I am not ruling out he was being flippied but it is a fair description of the flesh. I also agree that we don't need the fish in any waters that it hasn't already contaminated because it is a dominating species.   Art
