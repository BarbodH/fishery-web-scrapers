Last time they tuned my carbs up just because, when they were doing another job. Then Saturday I was having trouble with my boats electrical I stopped in on my way home and was given the fix to do at home it was just a loose wire but could have cost a lot if it was not for there knowledge of boats and free advice.  Thanks again Howell marine above and beyond what most places would do."
