The minister that married us said we weren't compatible lol. If people could have 1/10 the happiness we had, they would be doing okay. Never complained when I went fishing and was my biggest supporter when I went to work part time at BPS. I haven't been on here in awhile, but lurk every so often.  Still the best people here bar none. Maybe I'll have time to get back here now.  Never had time once I retired 8O).          "
