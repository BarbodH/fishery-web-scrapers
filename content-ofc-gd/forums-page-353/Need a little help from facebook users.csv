742766,danc,2012-11-09 00:32:00,4677,"Last summer I attended one of the largest country music festivals in the USA. WeFest in Detroit Lakes Minnesota. What a great time!! Anyways, there's a photo contest from last summers concert and first place is VIP tickets to next years event. I entered a photo and was put in the running for the contest. If you can find the time, and if you think my photo is worthy, I'd appreciate a ""like"".  You can view all of the entries Here  And you can view and ""like"" my photo HERE  Thanks all for reading this. Your ""like"" would be appreciated.  Oh. And the photo is of CMA award winners Little Big Town."
