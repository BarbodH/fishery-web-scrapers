742811,backbay,2012-11-09 02:32:00,773,"Hi Folks: Recently I received a message from the gang after I posted a photo in Skipper's thread regarding the season we've all had. It was concerning a catfish I had caught recently, (a first for me in many decades), and the type of cat that it was. The fish in question was a cat, which I thought was a bullhead, except they don't grow that big. It had a square tail, was very dark in colour. Here are a couple of pics, and I wish I had better ones, but this is it. Any assistance would be appreciated! Thanks, Backbay http://"
742813,DRIFTER_016,2012-11-09 02:35:00,10439,Looks like a dark coloured channel cat to me. Where was it caught?
742814,kickingfrog,2012-11-09 02:36:00,8333,Looks like a channel cat. Where was it caught?
742817,kickingfrog,2012-11-09 02:38:00,8333," Beat me to it. And yes Bullheads are not that big and also have a less forked, almost rounded tail."

742820,backbay,2012-11-09 02:41:00,773,"Thanks, Guys. It was caught in the Moon Riverr basin on Georgian Bay, in the Massasauga Park. The thing that confuses me is that it didn't have a channel cat's forked tail. The tail was big and flat across the back, not forked like a Channel's."
742821,backbay,2012-11-09 02:42:00,773,"hmmmm, maybe a flathead...."
742823,kickingfrog,2012-11-09 02:45:00,8333,I think that the tail is folded over on its self in the top photo.
742826,backbay,2012-11-09 02:48:00,773,"That's right, KF, it was folded over. I looked at the tail as soon as I landed it, 'cause that's one of the ways you can narrow down the variety.  Sinclair, I realize! This thing was a snick over 11 lbs, which is, confusing, if nothing else."
742828,backbay,2012-11-09 02:50:00,773, Definitely down. Good observation!
742856,camillj,2012-11-09 04:56:00,1988,Some big Channel Cats up that way ... I have seen them over 30lb in that area ... my vote is for Channel Cat
742866,Rich,2012-11-09 10:21:00,3927,"Its a channel cat from clear, rocky water."
742889,outllaw,2012-11-09 14:54:00,1232,channel they hit musky baits. st clair has tons of them lol
742913,jimmer,2012-11-09 19:36:00,2730,This is a black bullhead I caught down south a few years back. I think yours is a channel cat. 
743005,fishinguypat,2012-11-10 04:14:00,547,Have the boys in the lab do an autopsy
743015,bare foot wader,2012-11-10 05:24:00,1354,"having the tail in hand, and knowing for sure it's a square tail...that would make me think not channel cat...but never know for certain, a classic ""tall fish tale"" ha  I believe counting the rays on the anal fin would help determine species, but again, not possible with those pics  the larger bullheads down south, 4-5lbs, do look like that  I'm sure it'll be good conversation at the cottage for years to come"
743065,Raf,2012-11-10 17:01:00,3495,"fairly certain its a channel cat, that's how they look like up there  seen a bit bigger sized one caught on a musky reef in the same area.  hit a suick"
743106,chris.brock,2012-11-10 22:37:00,4053,"I'd say definately a channel cat, the bullheads and madtoms (way too big to be a madtom) have a tail closer to a bowfin, that tail looks forked but folded, there's plenty of them on the eastern shore of G Bay, aggresive too  I remember my grandfather used to keep channel cats from 12 mile bay to eat, he'd throw them in the trunk of his car in a garbage bag, drive home (about 3.5 hours the speed he drove), put them in his laundry sink with water and they would all revive, pretty tough species"
