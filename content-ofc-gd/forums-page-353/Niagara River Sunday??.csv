742944,outdoor,2012-11-09 23:29:00,19,Trying to get out the the niagara on Sunday if the weather co-operates. Never been successful there. Any species or tactic advice would be appreciated.
742969,Freshtrax,2012-11-10 01:30:00,2215,"I thought about it, it's given me fits before too don't feel bad.  From a trusted friend ""there there but have lockjaw"" that was from earlier in the week said it fished real slow but the fish were tail dancing and boiling all over the place.  Only one way to find out for sure. Good luck.  I've had sucess on just about everythin there when it's hot from yarn to live minnows.  If your using a short rod a slip bobber will be your friend.  Spoons work good too."

742987,Steve Piggott,2012-11-10 02:21:00,196,"I was on the river today.Water is clear,Lakers and bows on the artpark drift.All we caught was bass.Three-way rig,minnow,roe,or yarn.    "
743043,outdoor,2012-11-10 14:40:00,19,"Thanks all, The weathers even looking good. Hopefully I'll have something to report back"
743078,Bondar,2012-11-10 18:31:00,817,"My advice would be to buy a new york license and follow the raft of boats , can buy a day license for $15 online"
743083,Luke V.,2012-11-10 18:59:00,286,I'm agreeing with wiser. Get the 1 day American license. If you want smallies. Drop shot or three way rig on the bar. Tubes work too. If you want bows lakers or browns. Art park drift. Caught three lakers yesterday there in an hour and a half. Best was 16lbs! Three way rig with Kwik fish. As others have said follow the mass of boats. Good luck out there.
743102,bobkayla,2012-11-10 22:03:00,148,"roe  should be the ticket this time of year,,,try doubling up with a yarn fly with your roe ,"
743115,Rich Nelson,2012-11-11 00:02:00,332," I know its hard to avoid the Lakers, but they are oos right now... You arent allowed to ""want"" them right now... Ha ha"
743137,Luke V.,2012-11-11 03:55:00,286,I know I know. But when they are jumping right beside the boat and there in there but the 100's u can't avoid them. If you know where the pump house drift is my buddy found some scattered browns there today. Goodluck!
743156,Billy Bob,2012-11-11 12:26:00,5865,"Well, you pick a FANTASTIC day to hit the river...   GOOD LUCK,  Bob"
