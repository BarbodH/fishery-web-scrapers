Feeling pretty good we'll see how it goes, they tell me just be aware of any symptoms & follow up if it happens. Tight Lines & Thanx for all the Support SBK"

743260,Slop,2012-11-12 00:56:00,151,Congratulations to you!!! Fantastic news and all the best on your return to work.  I can relate. Getting back to work for me was a significant victory as well. It took a year and a half to beat the snot out of cancer and once again I get a chance to make a difference no matter how small.  There will be follow- ups regardless of symptoms present. Everyone that you know and don't know in the medical community is still going to want to get their hands all over you. They are a relentless bunch but should be commended for a job well done.
