Appropriate timing for a review of my and G-man's year. Featuring a few friends I managed to hook up with over the year and some great photo contributions by Fisherjuli, amongst others.  Till next spring."
742906,glen,2012-11-09 17:42:00,2641,Cool thanks.
742907,spincast,2012-11-09 17:43:00,3279,"and unfortunately. now I watch the posted version, I notice photobucket cut the last minute off. but the feel is there even if my salmon vid didn't make it"

Copied the html code and pasted it in the the reply. Just make sure you have the HTML On - Auto Linebreak Mode  This information may cost you a day on the water though....  Great recap of your season."
742914,spincast,2012-11-09 19:43:00,3279,Thanks Will  and any time you want to get out let me know - I think I will be the student on that trip from what I have seen of your outings.
742915,irishfield,2012-11-09 19:45:00,26272,Great stuff Rick! Nice blue boat at the end....
742917,spincast,2012-11-09 19:49:00,3279,"  who is that mystery man:lol:  I was looking for a shot of us all together and full face of ya Wayne, but Steph has them on her camera and G wanted to use them in his movie - which, given his inability to sit for long stretches of a time at anything other than fishing, means it will likely be a spring 2013 release date.   ."
742920,fishnsled,2012-11-09 20:15:00,3520,  You're welcome. Let's plan something for next year for sure! But after looking at those pics I believe that I will be the student. Maybe there's something we both can learn that day.
742949,asdve23rveavwa,2012-11-09 23:53:00,2690,"Great stuff, bud!  We didn't get out enough this summer.  Maybe a trip for some chrome still before things freeze up! I never get sick of seeing G'S Big grin!!"
742952,FisherJuli,2012-11-10 00:02:00,125,"Nice work, Rick!!  G-man just gets bigger and better, huh?! I still think that we need to get you ice fishing... Your winters will pass quicker, and you won't cringe when someone says the word 'winterized'. Great video- we can revisit those warm days and big beauties when the snow flies!"
743031,spincast,2012-11-10 12:27:00,3279," You're on Will - look forward to the opportunity.     You got that right Frank - outings were sparse for us this year - between weather and other commitments we both had we really didn't spend enought time on the water - but when we did it was great - even that roller coaster day in spring:whistling:  At least we know the Starcraft can ride out 3 footers with not too much difficulty - even if we struggle. Hopefully 2013 present a few more opportunities.   Ice fishin', huh? Stranger things have happened, ya ever know."
743042,Rod Caster,2012-11-10 14:38:00,5784,at around 1:30 that looks like one heck of a workout  Cool recap you made. That'll be a nice memory piece for the future. As a kid I'd be pouring over stuff like this over and over.
743051,Grimace,2012-11-10 16:03:00,2020,Looks like a great year with great fish.  No video can go wrong with a Tom Waits tune either.
743052,spincast,2012-11-10 16:05:00,3279," Thanks Chad - that was about 12 minutes into an 18 minute fight G had with that one. He had 30 lb mono on what turned out to be a fish in the high teens or low twenties. Every time G would bring in 30 feet, the fish would peel 20 back.  I was tightenting up the drag ever so slightly when the camera went off scene for a bit there. Took another 5 minutes once we got him beside the boat before we could net him. G took control the whole way.  Hopefully we can get you onto one of those next year."
743053,SlowPoke,2012-11-10 16:13:00,2984,Great recap Rick! Let's get G out for muskie next year. Sorry you can't make it out tomorrow but I hear you have better things to do... watching G-Man kick some butt!
743058,fishinguypat,2012-11-10 16:38:00,547,2012 ain't over yet mang!!
743072,tb4me,2012-11-10 17:47:00,3295,Nice vid Rick..This year looked like it was amazing for you and your family! This spring we will leave the boat at home and pound the banks of the Grand River..I know we keep saying that but this spring it has to happen!
743075,spincast,2012-11-10 18:16:00,3279,"  Thanks Brian - and thanks for the invite. I would really have liked to make another trip, but tomorrow is the award ceremony, and hopefully the last fising trip I loose to this black belt quest of G's. Good luck out there.!"
743516,Moosebunk,2012-11-13 00:45:00,3970,"Good tunes, great pics, better memories!  ""It's coming, get it ready"" says the wee lad reelin' in the big fish... like a Pro!"
743653,Dinky,2012-11-13 14:47:00,2,Whys that kid smilen so much????????  Cause you showed something better than xbox and p3  FISHIN!  WELL DONE!
743675,Live2fish85,2012-11-13 16:31:00,1633,Awesome video Rick. I finally got to watch it.  Can't wait to get out fishing with you and G again.
