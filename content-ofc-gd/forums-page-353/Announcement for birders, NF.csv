This is quite a rarity for this area so I'll be heading out today with the family.  If you go please remember basic birding etiquette; don't pester it for photos, don't get in the way of others, and don't do anything to make us unwelcome by the plaza management. I shouldn't have to stress those things, but there's always someone..."
743108,singingdog,2012-11-10 23:11:00,1047,"Yep, lots of gyrfalcons being reported in Ontario, as well as Boreal Owls starting to move down already."
743110,Joey,2012-11-10 23:21:00,9122,"Cool, I'd love to see that, thanks for letting us know.  I was playing cat and mouse with a red tailed hawk today.  He won as you can see here   :  "
743125,Dave Bailey,2012-11-11 02:02:00,1641,"Missed it today. Apparently it has jesses on the legs, so it's a bird lost by a falconer. I hope it belonged to the guy I'm thinking of, because he's a Grade 'A' jerk!"
