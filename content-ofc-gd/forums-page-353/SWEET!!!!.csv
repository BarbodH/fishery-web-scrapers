742926,tb4me,2012-11-09 20:41:00,3295,Any Ideas of rosters? Lets hope they dont settle the lockout this week...Sounds like a great time to be had!
742931,DRIFTER_016,2012-11-09 21:02:00,10439, Paper said that the roster will be confirmed after Thursdays game in Thunder Bay. So hopefully they print it in next Fridays paper. Though it doesn't really matter.
742943,kickingfrog,2012-11-09 23:27:00,8333,The trip will be nothin' like the one Dawson City had to make for their Stanley Cup.
742990,Slop,2012-11-10 02:38:00,151,"In eastern Ontario, the same kind of charity event is happening. It's in Cornwall. Dan Alfredsson aka crusty the clown and a new SEN aquired from Montreal, Latrendesse will have played the game.  I also believe some hockey players will be featured in a reality show...ice pilots when they are in drifter territory.  Have fun at the game."
