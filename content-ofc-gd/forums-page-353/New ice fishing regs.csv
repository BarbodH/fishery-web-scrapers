743676,misfish,2012-11-13 16:31:00,29133,  Ya.Those are the guys you see way down the lake.LOL
743754,jimmer,2012-11-13 21:25:00,2730,Are you serious about Little Lake?
743755,davey buoy,2012-11-13 21:27:00,5505,"That can't be legal?,is it?No way!Ok,you got me lol.!!"
743756,kickingfrog,2012-11-13 21:32:00,8333,"Depends where it is. Here in Ontario, no, not legal. But other areas do allow more then 2 rods."
743771,fishnsled,2012-11-13 22:04:00,3520,"Labyrinth Lake, on the Ontario side, use to be a lake where you could have 4 or 5 lines per guy I believe. Only fished it the once quite a few years ago and having the extra lines didn't help. lol. Just looked in the regs and they don't seem to have that exception to the rules anymore."
743781,Skud,2012-11-13 22:42:00,739,"I don't know where that pic is from, but probably from the other side of the planet. My first thought when I seen it was the the guys that fish in Little lake on the south end with 5 plus lines each for pike."
743782,misfish,2012-11-13 22:45:00,29133," Doug,yer giving away their secret honey holes.LMAO"
743785,iFish4real,2012-11-13 22:58:00,386,I just applied for a MNR officer job...I'm gonna get'em
743788,Rich,2012-11-13 23:03:00,3927,"We have a local ""fisherman"" who frequents localities that we refer to as ""Six Lines"" .. you can imagine why. Every year, same spot. 3 lines tied to pop bottles, one on a MH baitcaster and 2 normal ice rods. He's had his fishing license revoked and been fined a large number of times. He takes off if you mention MNR... But always comes back."
