742960,moxie,2012-11-10 00:27:00,1566,To those who gave selflessly of themselves and carried out the most ultimate of sacrifices in the hope and belief we would never have to. Also to those that continue to serve. Thank you.

743063,lew,2012-11-10 16:54:00,12766," My dad spent the war  escorting the Merchant Navy convoys across the Atlantic Ocean  trying to keep the German U-Boats away from them.  Alot of times they were successful, but often there were just too many subs and they'd get through the escorts. Dad saw far too many ships torpedoed and men killed but said one terrible night that always stuck with him was when he watched three different ships explode around him within a few minutes killing all hands.  The merchant navy suffered terrible losses but sadly never really received the recognition they deserved.  Who knows, perhaps  Jock & my dad crossed paths a time or two out there in the darkness trying to survive the nights and  get through the wolf packs.  This was Dad's corvette, HMCS Kitchener.  "
743066,tb4me,2012-11-10 17:04:00,3295,"  Lew, Don Cherry did a nice piece on the fan 590 yeaterday on those corvettes. He said they were canadian made and one of the worst ships to be in the Atlantic with, they were rough and got tossed around horribly..Those were the days of real men, thats for sure..Im not to sure if anyone can find the audio track from the fan or not but it would be worth a listen..If you can handle Don for a couple minutes...lol  Here is the story from Don himself..Dudley Red Garret is who he is talking about..Good listen thats for sure  http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/grapeline/~3/PY76txkpZxM/gl_20121109_172813--Grapeline---November-9---Friday.mp3"

743068,Twocoda,2012-11-10 17:18:00,4130,And to their surviving families
743069,lew,2012-11-10 17:18:00,12766," Kitchener above was made in Lauzon Quebec.  They were only 200' long and bounced like a cork.  As for Cherry, thanks for the suggestion but he's a bit too much for me and  I'll have to pass"
743070,nofish4me,2012-11-10 17:22:00,404," I'm sure it'll be busier than normal, glad for it.  Having said that, I have put my job on the line for one day, guess what?  I know that everyone cannot get away with such stuff.  I've worked for 30yrs for the same company. They know where I'll be Nov. 11 (for the whole day)  Everyone's situation is different, I respect that, I always hope that they can respect mine."

743100,Woodsman,2012-11-10 21:20:00,1286,This statement I find offensive. Not for those who made the ultimate sacrifice or those who continue to serve but for all those left out being those who have served. Every time I hear the Timmies add stating the same I see red. To show respect for a new serving private but disregarding a great many long serving veterans who no longer are currently serving is completely wrong IMO. Anyone who has served or is serving have done their part. Sadly some have been called on to pay a far higher price.  Pro Patria.
743117,sneak_e_pete,2012-11-11 00:44:00,540,True heroes.  Those men and women were truly fearless and dedicated to our country.  I personally am not as brave as they were and I owe my current way of living to them.  God bless.
743126,moxie,2012-11-11 02:13:00,1566," Many people have served including the families, friends, countrymen and women all over the world during most notably the First and Second World Wars and subsequent conflicts on virtually every land mass on this little blue marble we call home. They suffered and continue to suffer past and present regardless which flag has flown or continues to fly above them.  I have tried, in thought to imagine having to kill others who believe in their own cause as they attempt to kill you for believing in yours. No nightmare or fear I've ever had even registers the most remote of comparisons. All aspects of war are a poignant  reminder of both the worst and the best of man and as long as people continue to serve they should all be remembered."
743182,Dave Bailey,2012-11-11 15:12:00,1641,"When it comes to selecting our leaders, remember this: Soldiers, sailors, and airmen, are only called upon to do their jobs when politicians, diplomats, and bureaucrats, fail at theirs.  I thank my parents, both RAF, and will remember all my comrades, some fallen, some still alive but bearing scars, and the lucky ones, like me, who were never in the line of fire.  "
743192,lew,2012-11-11 17:04:00,12766,"I just got home from the Remembrance Day Ceremonny in Peterboro and as always, it was exceptional. It was great to see so many folks, young, old and everywhere in between attending and it seems every year, there's less veterans, but more civilians there.  It's a day for all Canadians to extremely proud."
743211,Woodsman,2012-11-11 19:58:00,1286,I also just got back from the service in Seaforth. My first in my new community and there was a great turn out.  Pro Patria: Rick
743344,DanD,2012-11-12 13:24:00,2223,"Both my patents were in their early and mid teens, living in occupied Belgium during WWII. My dad at the time was too young to be in the army but him and his dad (grandpa fought in the trenches during WW1) did their part with the underground, working with the local resistance groups. Grandpa had a farm that the Germans picked clean of anything that was of value to them; but they never found the entrance to the basement that was under the barn. That’s where grandpa and dad hid Canadian and British service men that had escaped from POW camps or shot down airmen. They would hide these men there until they got forged identification papers for them; that’s so they could get to the coast, across the English Channel and back to England. So Remembrance Day for me isn’t just the enlisted people that served, it’s also the civilians that put their lives on the line too support and care for them. There was no prison for civilians caught working with the alies; they were shot on site.  Dan."
743345,lew,2012-11-12 13:30:00,12766, Absolutely outstanding Dan !!!!
