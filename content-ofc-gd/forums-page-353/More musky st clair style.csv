743132,moemoe,2012-11-11 03:15:00,352,"Got out to Lake St Clair for the last boat trip of the year yesterday. Worth the drive. Fished the mouth and river at the ""ditch"" and ended up 4 for 8, Biggest was 50.5 and a 46 as well. The river was definetly more productive for us. All rips came on big nils custom painted, in blue perch and helin frog. Thanks to George/Wood Wacker for the awesome squirt job, I love it so much it gives me a ""woodie""! lol heres some pics      the hot lure "

743237,moemoe,2012-11-11 22:48:00,352," Looking at the satellite maps, the whole lake looked muddy, the only difference i figure is that fish in thames are used to feeding in muddy water"
743242,hotsky,2012-11-11 23:34:00,400,Nice report! Do musky's stay at the Thames all year or just in the fall? For some reason never thought they would be there but it makes sense. How far down the river can they be found?
