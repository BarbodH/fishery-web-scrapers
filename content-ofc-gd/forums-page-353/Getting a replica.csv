743522,Handlebarz,2012-11-13 00:54:00,3790,I guess I should say I got dads walleye done there and it is amazing and will last a lifetime. Dad loved it and now it hangs in memory of him.
743529,Live2fish85,2012-11-13 01:10:00,1633,Awesome thanks guys.

743650,jimmer,2012-11-13 14:44:00,2730,"The trick is to check out the work before you agree to anything. Make sure you see some of the taxidermists finished product. Yes, Advanced is great, but there are others out there that are also good. Advanced probably has a huge stock of molds and can alter one to suit a fish if required. Others tend to order fish blanks from the states and just attach the fins and paint them. Painting a replica is far different than painting a skin mount, that's why you should always see a painted replica before agreeing to purchase. It takes a special talent to bring a white fish blank to life. Check out the Advanced website to start, then go from there."

743764,BucktownAngler,2012-11-13 21:45:00,582,"the mounts ive seen by advanced do look pretty good, and very detailed.  i just dont like how they look so glossy. Like they have a fresh coat of wax or something"
743765,BucktownAngler,2012-11-13 21:46:00,582,"from the website   if somebody knows someone better, maybe you can get a free mount out of it"
743773,Roy,2012-11-13 22:11:00,13728, It's how they find and hire all the most talented people.
743778,bare foot wader,2012-11-13 22:34:00,1354," I've had the pleasure to see a fittante and advanced taxi in the same room, perhaps not fair to compare different species...but the advanced was down right better, they both had great body details, accurate to the pictures of the real fish..but advanced had more intricate detail around the head features and gill plate, underside of the jaws...the fittante eye just didn't seem right  I don't think anybody can go wrong with an advanced reproduction"
743780,Live2fish85,2012-11-13 22:38:00,1633,Awesome thanks a ton guys.  He has talked with the guys from Advanced and I believe they will be doing the work.  Thanks again.
743850,captpierre,2012-11-14 01:16:00,2521, I agree.  Way too glossy.  Can you ask them to back off on that?  Other than that Advanced do an amazing job.  Still thinking of having my 52 in ski done in replica.
743858,DRIFTER_016,2012-11-14 01:24:00,10439, I'm sure they can do a matte or semi gloss finish if you ask for it.  I have a couple of replicas I want done just need the $$$$ to pay for them. Them biguns cost a pretty penny.
743866,Handlebarz,2012-11-14 01:51:00,3790,They will take a deposit and let you pay it off they will show it in there showroom until you pick it up which dads was it was awesome to see it among all the other mounts.
743873,captpierre,2012-11-14 02:17:00,2521,Got a quote of $1000 for a 52 inch ski.  Nothing fancy.  Just the fish
743936,Fish4Eyes,2012-11-14 13:25:00,1022,I have seen Advanced's work at fishing shows and they are phenominal.
