I got my G1 in Aug 2003 I got my G2 the day before my G1 expired, I paid $75 to renew my license, validating my G2 for another 5 years I got my G in 2012.    I did not have to ask for an extension nor get special permission for a renewal.     "

Were still going to call tomorrow morning to confirm. No second written or road test. That wouldn't be bad if that's the case. funfishing,that is pretty well what he found out last night  Thanks."

743269,BillM,2012-11-12 01:29:00,17367," Lew it's really not complicated, most people can't seem to read very well, lol!  As far as the tests are concerned, they are a joke!   We hand out driving licenses like candy..  They should make the tests a whole hell of a lot harder.  Do people realize cars are basically 3000lb bullets?  I put more work into my PAL then I did my drivers license."
743297,funfishing,2012-11-12 02:23:00,147,"I'm not sure stricter road tests would do a damned thing about road safety.  Some of the examiners are such buffoons. I was asked during my G to ""hurry it up"" in a 50 zone because I was doing 40. It was raining. Then I was reamed for slowing down on a lane change, even though a car was up ahead in the lane I was changing into, and there no were other cars on the road behind me in either lane. ""And what if there had been a car behind you?"" ""Well, doofus, there wasn't, but there was one up ahead!""  All the while you're giving yourself whiplash constantly looking in every direction.  I wonder what the qualifications are to get a job as an examiner, I'm sure they are very lax.   Radars and cameras on every corner, basically outlawing speeding once and for all, would go a long way in improving road safety. Why are cars made to go 150 km/h+? Not for safety reasons..."
743298,funfishing,2012-11-12 02:25:00,147,"I think it is fairly complicated, and expensive.  Even just the names are complicated. G1, G2, then G? G1, G2, G3 would make more sense, or even just 1, 2, 3"

This set up is new to me. After the replies and a little more digging,your right,it doesn't seem so difficult now. How about the license system be changed as follows G2,G1,G. Just sayin! lol. Thanks for the replies everyone,a phone call will be made today."
743022,davey buoy,2012-11-10 11:12:00,5505,"Good morning,my oldest son has dragged his rear with his G1. He now has a real good job and wants to get his license. Yesterday he started a refresh drivers course. 5 lessens,two hours per appointment, than use his car for the G2 driving test. Now here is where I believe the problem arises. By moths end,all goes well he'll have his G2. Fine,he now says his G1 ends in June at 5 years. Meaning he believes he has to have at least a year with the G2 before final G. May have to start all over again as now This coming June would not be 12 mths with a g2. My question,is if everything is in motion,will they extend the timeline? .Even a slight penalty for letting this go on for so long would be ok. It would be a shame to start over but if so what can you do. Thanks for any help. I hope this makes some sense."
743025,DaveMc,2012-11-10 12:01:00,89,"to the best of my knowledge you have 5 years to go from g1 - g2, once you get your g2 you have so long to get your g. call the MOT, they will give you the correct info."
743026,davey buoy,2012-11-10 12:07:00,5505," Thanks,he will call Monday, I don't know if the instructor told him that yesterday or not,but he was getting a bit upset or worried.

743028,HTHM,2012-11-10 12:16:00,4082,"Perhaps moving into an apartment is worth looking at as well, 12 hours shifts plus 4 hours of driving is 16 hours a day. That leaves only 8 hours for sleeping. Just something to consider. When you get the answer please share it, I have a son in the same position, he is taking is sweet time getting his G2 as well."
743030,davey buoy,2012-11-10 12:25:00,5505," From what I gather from the website Roy posted,is if the G2 runs out of time,you re-write the G1 test,if pass again,they grant you a G2 automatically up to another 5 years. Someone please correct me if I'm wrong.Thanks Roy.  Further reading says you have to redo your G1 road test again to get 5 more years as a G2"

743079,Joeytier,2012-11-10 18:39:00,3990,It is possible for your son to get an extension if he books his G test as soon as he can.

743081,davey buoy,2012-11-10 18:48:00,5505," From what I've found out now, He won't be able to do his G2 till after 5 more two hour driving sessions. At best G2 by Dec 1st. This allows him only 6 mths till his G1, 5 year runs out. Not the full year they require. Kids today:wallbash:"
743082,davey buoy,2012-11-10 18:51:00,5505," That will have to be the angle we use ,as it is because of 12 hour continental shifts,and lots of OT. Slow transit ,weekends as well etc. Thanks. Oh by the way he is 23 turning 24 Jan 29. Maybe his slightly older age may work in his favor?"
743084,bare foot wader,2012-11-10 19:04:00,1354,"it may work in his favour, and being employed where he needs a valid licence may help as well...it all depends on who you encounter at the office and approves the extension  if no luck, it's not the end of the world, i got my full G a week after the initial 5 years expired....I was as polite as I could be, said i would wait all day for a cancelled road test, just graduated, good job, needed a licence  just hope for the best and not much else he can do"

I got my G2 the day my G1 was going to expire (why get it earlier, how the hell can a young student afford a car, + insurance, + gas ??)  The reason the above posted did not get another 5 years, is because he failed his G2, and thus allowed his G1 to expire. Once your G1 expires, you're back to having to get your G1 so you're starting over again technically. Had he passed his G2, his G2 would have been valid for 5 years, thus giving him another 5 years to get his G.  Call on Monday, because regulations are constantly changing, but I highly doubt they would change this.  Hope that helps.  "
743092,bare foot wader,2012-11-10 20:24:00,1354,"what?...  this is straight from the website:  ""You have up to five years to finish the whole process.  After five years, if you do not get your full G licence, you will need to start over.""  http://www.ontario.ca/driving-and-roads/get-g-drivers-licence-new-drivers"
743097,funfishing,2012-11-10 20:48:00,147," It also says on the site that you must wait 12 months after passing your G2, to take your G road test, and yet you claim to have done both in one day?  In any case, I am 25, and I wrote out the years in which I did my tests. As I stated, rules change. Despite what the site says, I still think the rules I got still apply, so the OP should call and clarify by telephone. If his son passes his G2 right now, and the rules that I went by still apply, his G2 will be valid for 5 years. If new rules exist, he should figure out exactly what would happen to his son, because if he needs to wait 12 months to do his final road test, but that falls after the 5 years from the date he got his G1, I am not sure what would happen. Also keep in mind, if a new ""5 years to do it all"" rule was implemented recently, it probably will not apply to his son, who got his G1 5 years ago"
743098,bare foot wader,2012-11-10 20:55:00,1354,"after the inital 5 yr period...when you re-enter the graduated licencing program, there is no waiting period between tests  the 5yr rule has been around for a while...I don't doubt you achieved your licence on those dates...I just think you got your info wrong  and yes, his son should call and find out directly he needs to do"
743099,lew,2012-11-10 21:00:00,12766,"I can't believe how complicated this whole drivers license thing has become.  I got mine waaaay back in 1962 and it was so simple. You got your learners permit, which was for 60 days, then as soon as you felt you were ready to take the test, you went in, took it, and they gave you your full license.....done.  I haven't really payed much attention to the new graduated system so I honestly don't know if it makes for better drivers or not, but it just seems to me to be one more thing the government has messed up and made much more complicated than is necessary.  ...drivers license...boaters licence...gun registry...and whatever else  Or maybe I'm just getting old"

743104,davey buoy,2012-11-10 22:14:00,5505, That applies to my younger son that will take his G2 at least 2 months earlier than the year. He will try for it when college closes for Christmas break.  We /or he my older son will call Monday to make sure what direction to take. I also believe it is far more difficult than it should be IMO.
