741490,chris.brock,2012-11-01 22:27:00,4053,"It snowed 40+ cm's per day for 3 days, for a total of 122 cm, we came up at the tail end of the storm, the date in the pics isn't quite right  the dog had to be carried while breaking trail    getting wood from the shed    the truck's stuck    the phazer didn't like the deep powder, lots of digging to break the trail, I wish I had the BR250 longtrack back then    pretty scene, we can relax after everything is taken care of  "
741492,ecmilley,2012-11-01 22:33:00,2163,i remember that storm like 6 inches of snow at my place and 3 ft 20 minutes north in kinmount
741500,chris.brock,2012-11-01 22:42:00,4053,"yeah, it was really specific where it hit, driving up, it was like somebody had drawn a line in the sand"
741501,Christopheraaron,2012-11-01 22:43:00,3525,can't you just not wait for that again?!

741504,BillM,2012-11-01 22:45:00,17367,I fell in love the first time I ever laid eyes on a Phazer as a kid!
741508,Joeytier,2012-11-01 22:53:00,3990,The precipitation forecasts are changing from millimeters to centimeters round here...bring it on!!
741521,Freshtrax,2012-11-01 23:22:00,2215,"Just tuned up the old sled last weekend, plugs, carbs, belt, new helix seccondary spring and a little more weight in the primarys(  I'm pretty sure I have the fastest hut pulling sled on the lake   ) any takers? I can't wait.   Don't let the 600 on the hood fool ya I kinda like them there people are like what the hell after a long pull  113 mph on the gps.    Edited for typos"
741595,chris.brock,2012-11-02 03:11:00,4053,"yeah, I hear ya, the Darth Vader sled, pretty cool classic sled, it runs like a scared rabbit when it's -15, I picked up a br250 longtrack that I've fallen in love with for bushwacking in Haliburton, I'm a Yamaha fan (like you're a VW fan)"
741600,Freshtrax,2012-11-02 03:39:00,2215,"My first sled was a 86 bravo, was not a long track but that thing was indestructible .  Zero mantinance and beat up by me and my cousins for 20 years would start 3rd pull every morning.  the perfect ice fishing sled."
741608,turtle,2012-11-02 10:40:00,274,I have a place in the north end of Haliburton and remember that year well.  There were two years in a row with lots of snow and the last two with little. Started on the last weekend of the deer rifle hunt.  Went from bare ground to well over a foot on the Saturday night and was on the ground to well into April.  I think it contributed to the last two poor deer seasons up there. This year saw lots of deer. I don't yet have a snowmobile and walk 2.5 km to the cottage from the paved road so I am very familar with the snow up there.
741611,singingdog,2012-11-02 11:01:00,1047,"Quickest start to the ski season we ever had....although it was a bear to groom. We had 3 folks on snowshoes in front of the snowmobile, just trying to get down the trail."
741616,ecmilley,2012-11-02 11:33:00,2163," couple more weeks and just maybe go disturb the neigbourhood, think it was 09 that i was out riding ganaraska forest by dec"
741624,Rod Caster,2012-11-02 12:11:00,5784,Its about darn time. Bring on the white stuff in hogsheads and in meters and temperatures so low it'll be freezing off peters. The crazies will be crazy so let 'em turn early while I hike and jig and others become  lazy.
743073,F_ast,2012-11-10 17:52:00,154,I too remember that storm.  We have a place just NE of Haliburton on Moose Lake.  As a sledder I was in heaven... But a week later I was crying when we got 30mm of rain and +5 temps.
