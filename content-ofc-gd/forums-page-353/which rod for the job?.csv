I am thinking about a new rod that can double duty for occassional drop shotting and for 3way rigging/drifting.  probably a 7 footer? Thoughts or ideas? Budget is $100."
742855,Luke V.,2012-11-09 04:44:00,286,Mark! A 7' medium fast is what your after as stated above. Brand doesn't matter. Pick your favourite and there are lots to choose from. For me would be a St. Croix triumph or a shimano compre. Good luck with the rod hunt! If your there on Saturday I might see you

743023,singingdog,2012-11-10 11:35:00,1047,"I wouldn't go with a compre 7' M for dropshotting. I have one, and the action IMHO is not really fast enough for a dropshot rod: the tip is quite flexible. It is a great rod for light jigs and unweighted plastics, but not really a dropshot rod."
