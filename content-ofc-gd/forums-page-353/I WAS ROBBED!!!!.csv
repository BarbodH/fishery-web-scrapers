743678,capt_hooked,2012-11-13 16:35:00,212,"Wesakechak (also spelled Wisakedjak, Whiskey-Jack, and several other ways.) Wesakechak is the benevolent culture hero of the Cree tribe (sometimes referred to as a ""transformer"" by folklorists.) His name is spelled so many different ways partially because Cree was originally an unwritten language (so English speakers just spelled it however it sounded to them at the time), and partially because the Cree language is spoken across a huge geographical range in both Canada and the US, and the name sounds different in different dialects. The correct pronounciation in Plains Cree is similar to wee-sah-keh-chahk."
743681,capt_hooked,2012-11-13 16:47:00,212,"Female incubating her eggs Breeding Gray Jays build nests and lay eggs in March or even February, when snow is deep in the boreal forest, temperatures may plunge far below freezing, and there is no obvious food to support reproduction. In spite of such hostile conditions, Gray Jays have a high rate of nest success and the young typically leave the nest in late April, well before most boreal birds have even returned from the south, let alone begun nesting themselves. Just as strange, Gray Jays never bring off a second brood in the same season even though there would probably be time to do so and therefore to produce more young per year than they actually do. Stored food enables nesting jays to feed their young even during a blizzard but this only explains how Gray Jays can get away with nesting in late winter and contributes nothing to understanding why it is advantageous to do so. Among other possible benefits, early nesting Gray Jays have nesting over and done with at a correspondingly early date and can invest more food storage effort into their territories before the following winter. Assuming much of the stored food lasts until the onset of cold temperatures, storing more food on the territory should mean that early nesting jays have a better prospect of making it through the long, seemingly foodless boreal winter by staying at home and therefore avoiding the dangers of migration. This might mean that fewer young would be produced each breeding season (than if nesting occurred in June) but if it means that early nesting Gray Jays live longer and nest more often, they may still produce more surviving young in the long run than if they re-nested, or nested just once but later in the season)."
743127,TJQ,2012-11-11 02:33:00,7806,"I had an opportunity to go moose hunting to try to fill out some calf tags this weekend, with a very dear friend to me and his family... (we've been good friends since kindergarten) well the moose hunting was slow even though my more than capable guides dogged a couple of very large areas for us to no avail. On the second day.. this morning, however I was accosted in my watch by a band of PIRATES!! I filmed the burglary of my lunch, and chuckeled all day long at their persistence.. At one point I had to throw my crust away from the watch so i could eat my sandwiches as one of em, took a bite outta it while i was eating it!! LOL.. Its a great vid, there's a treat at the end.  <iframe width=""640"" height=""480"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/bC5DtEzLVmQ"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>  Oh,,, and yes,.,, that is duct tape on my rifle... if anyone can get me the pin to fix it.. lol. lemme know!"
743129,ccmtcanada,2012-11-11 03:05:00,7971,I think I heard 3 moose walking 10 feet by your spot there while you were playing with the birds....  Great video TJ!!!

743135,danc,2012-11-11 03:34:00,4677,"Had a lot of interesting issues with Whiskey Jacks over the years as well TJ. One that comes to mind is when I was cleaning some Grouse beside my truck on a bush trail. I knew that there was a couple of Jacks watching me at the time. I pretty much had the Grouse all cleaned and ready to go and went back to my truck for some zip lock bags. As soon as I turned my back, the Jacks pounced on my Grouse breasts and took off with them. I wasn't too happy at the time but over the years have grown to appreciate the social aspect of these birds. Great video. I've also hand fed them on the dash of my snowmobile while ice fishing a few years back."
743141,Garfisher,2012-11-11 05:11:00,229,"Funniest thing I've seen this fall involved a whiskeyjack. On a little trip to the Spruce Bog in Algonquin while at field camp, we found a couple along the trail (we had already fed some at the parking lot). One of the guys I was with decided to stick his hand out like he had food. One landed on his hand, looked down, looked at him, looked back down, and then bit him in the webbing at the base of his fingers and flew off  (that was the entire group reaction who seen it)"

I could have gotten an hour of video.. they were relentless.. even after I stopped feeding them they would scare the crap outta me on an hourly basis by coming in and landing next to me to see if there was a next course!!

743197,Tootsie II,2012-11-11 18:54:00,162,"Glad to see the term ""Wiskeyjacks"" is still around. Anytime I use that name around here, people look at me like I have two heads. Yet, when I was growing up in Timmins, that's the only name we gave them. We also considered anyone who ever shot one of these to be a real ""sc*mb!g"". It is amazing how they find people with food. In January and February of 1980 when we were surveying some mining claims in Langmuir Township, South-East of Timmins, we had to work through 4 weeks of -20 F to -30 F or colder weather. We were getting our bag lunches from the camp cooks at the Bradley Brothers diamond drilling camp and he/she always put cookies in the bags. Every day around noon when our two native line cutters would build a large bonfire to warm up and thaw out and toast our sandwiches and make tea, the Wiskeyjacks would just appear from nowhere to claim there share. They got the cookies and sometimes some pieces of sandwich. It actually help brighten those short, dreary and very cold days."
743201,misfish,2012-11-11 19:16:00,29133,"Very cool Boss.  While I was out this weekend,I had those pesky chickidees buzzing me. Heck,even the blue jays were still up north. That has to be a sign of a mild winter coming.   I seen 4 doe,s and no bucks.Doe,s were off limits. Lots of good sign where I was,but way to frigg,n warm. +3 at 6am and even warmer as the day went on. First time I didnt freeze my tukus off in many years.   Lots of empty trailers, heading south.   Snow came a week before the warm front.    Lots of sign.             A great 2 days well spent with my pop,none the less."
