743013,dhickey,2012-11-10 04:51:00,1038,Jut a thought. There is a intestonal virus that causes fish to bloat up its somewhat comone in salt water fish but has been reported in fresh water fish over the past few years. Its not deadly but does simply bloats the fish for a short time.  Kinda like having the flue. Has any one els herd of this virus?  ????? salty.
