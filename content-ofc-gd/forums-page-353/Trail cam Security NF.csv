742084,BillM,2012-11-04 21:49:00,17367,Make sure it's hidden properly...
742104,iFish4real,2012-11-05 00:01:00,386,I wouldn't put in a place hunting competitors could see it
742109,DRIFTER_016,2012-11-05 00:35:00,10439,Deadman's switch connected to 3#'s of C4. You may lose a camera but it won't get stolen.
742113,dhickey,2012-11-05 00:48:00,1038,Just put a sign under it that simply states that THIEVES AND VARMITS WILL BE SHOT ON SITE!!! NO EXCEPTIONS!!!!!!
742129,Nipfisher,2012-11-05 01:43:00,2449,"Put a sign below it that says. Smile, you're in my crosshairs."
742134,chris.brock,2012-11-05 01:54:00,4053,"I had one stolen, looked like a father and younger kid (his son?) from the tracks around the tree where it was strapped, the $100 for the camera is one thing, all the awesome pics I had on that memory card was the toughest pill to swallow  I actually put the word out, into a circle of friends who might know somebody who knows something, if someone can get my memory card back, I would be very gratefull with no questions asked, no luck though"

742149,HTHM,2012-11-05 03:26:00,4082,That is great! I think I will try to do something similar to my son-in-law. I just bought him one and think this might be a great prank to pull on him.
743659,moose,2012-11-13 15:14:00,266,      What I did was go to dollar store bought acrylic paint black brown green grey and painted camouflage  the camera
743663,DOS,2012-11-13 15:50:00,119,"The sad part is anything you do will only stop the honest theives.  Chain it to the tree- they will cut the tree if they want it.   Two options have been booted around and they will work.  There are new models that are cell phone transmitters( meaning pics go directly to your phone and e-mail addy) this way you will have a pic of the theives right away.  Second, simply put a sign below the camera saying 'your picture has been sent to me already, think before you steal this camera'  even if it isn't a cell trail camera they may think twice before swiping it...  The C4 is a good idea also....  RED"
