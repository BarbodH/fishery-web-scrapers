742980,bigugli,2012-11-10 02:10:00,6138,"A person's rights should be forfeit the moment they violate the rights of others.  The other way to see it is simple. Rights must be balanced with responsibilities. Failure to meet one's responsibility should be met with a suitable loss of rights. Sadly, his kind of vermin never receive the appropriate punishment."
