743119,Moosebunk,2012-11-11 01:43:00,3970, Didn't need to go any further than that.  Strong needlenose pliers and grip'er good!
742732,Christopheraaron,2012-11-08 23:12:00,3525,"Hey guys, recently I started making musky inlines. I got pretty far, I'm fine with the o rings, coils and blades but I've kind of hit a wall with the eye, I can bend it but can't wrap the 0.62 wire without it straying away from the main shaft, here's a picture of my problem...   "
742737,Handlebarz,2012-11-08 23:30:00,3790,Use more elbow grease that is the main trick.
742742,bare foot wader,2012-11-08 23:47:00,1354,elbow grease as mentioned  are you using pliers or a jig?
742745,cheaptackle,2012-11-08 23:59:00,849,"Take a look at the luremaking.com site Chris - I've got both styles of their benders.  The more expensive one does a great job.  If it's in your budget you won't be sorry at all.  The smaller one is just ok for lighter wire & occasional use, I actually don't use it at all now I have the bigger one. I think you need to use 2 pairs of pliers if you're going to attempt doing it without the benders - a whole lot of patience too!  Michael"

742764,Roy,2012-11-09 00:25:00,13728,"Christopher, the largest wire bender you can get for that application is the one that luremaking.com sells and it can only handle wire up to .041"". There is an attachment available for that machine that'll get you up to .051"" wire. Aside from industrial machines, I don't know of any that'll bend .062. For musky baits, you'll do fine with .051"". I have inlines and spinnerbaits using .062"" wire but they were all made by hand using pliers and 2 pairs of vice grips or a bench vice.  Also, if you're going to be making wire baits, do yourself a favour and wear safety glasses.  Good luck."
742777,Christopheraaron,2012-11-09 00:51:00,3525," Thanks guys, I've looked at the wire bender but I don't know if I really want to spend that chunk of change on it, we're getting the bench vise out tomorrow to see if that helps. I've been doing I guess the 0.041 wire and a comfortable with that. And Roy, I learned that this morning when the whole shaft sprung at my eye, eye protection from now on for sure lol!"
742779,Joey,2012-11-09 00:58:00,9122,"I agree with the elbow grease.  I'm a gal and I figured it out using only one pair of pliers and my thumb.  I cut myself a few times and it hurt a few times but you get it after awhile.  Keep trying and you'll get the hang of it! Never try it without the plyers in the loop, that's when it goes wrong!  Edit to note:  always leave yourself alot of wire to wrap, it makes it much easier!"
742791,outllaw,2012-11-09 01:16:00,1232,i bend wire  for my wire thru lures. be prepared for sore fingers swollen joints lol. now honey wheres the advil
742793,Christopheraaron,2012-11-09 01:22:00,3525,Lol! I take enough Advil as it is for my arthritis
742797,Christopheraaron,2012-11-09 01:32:00,3525, What do you mean? I'm using 2 pairs of pliers right now.
742858,nlpaintballer,2012-11-09 05:19:00,122,"I use vice-grips to clamp on the loop and a good pair of needlenose pliers to spin the tail end around the shaft. You don't need a large tail end either, just enough to wrap around the shaft a couple of times."
742860,Garry2Rs,2012-11-09 05:44:00,1425,"Hi Chris; I own a professional wire bender that will do the job. Tie your skirts and assemble your baits, then set them aside until April. When I get home, you can come up and I will help you finish the whole works in a couple of hours.  I can also show you how to tie the best skirt you have ever seen, at the same time. Garry2R's"
742877,Christopheraaron,2012-11-09 13:31:00,3525,"Thanks for the offer 2rs, if I can't get this thing to work I'll take it, even if I don't end up needing it I'll come up there for a day"
742885,Roy,2012-11-09 14:27:00,13728, Which one do you have Garry?
742888,Christopheraaron,2012-11-09 14:51:00,3525," Hey Garry, one other thing, do you by any chance know Matt billings?"
742890,woodenboater,2012-11-09 15:07:00,2277,"Never made my own inlines but I would second Joey's advice about leaving a long tag end. The longer tail would give you better leverage for those wraps. and Roy's advice is very important, get proper eye pro.  One thing I'd experiment with if you don't want to get a bender would be to get a length of hardwood dowel. Drill an appropriate sized hole down the length. The wire would slide in here and the dowel would be used as a wrench for making your wraps. Kinda like taping your hockey stick. just thinking..."
742891,Christopheraaron,2012-11-09 15:08:00,3525,"Great idea wb, ill definitely try that out"
742894,fishnsled,2012-11-09 16:08:00,3520,"Very nice offer Garry!  This video might be of some help. Saw it the other day and looks like it might do the trick for you.   <iframe width=""420"" height=""315"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/DDy54ZZQanE"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>"

742909,Garry2Rs,2012-11-09 18:14:00,1425,"I have the Hagen's ""Professional Wire Former"" with the heavy wire kit. It is rated for .58 wire, but will twist .61 (16 gauge stainless welding rod) if you lubricate the wire. Garry2rs        "
742910,Roy,2012-11-09 18:40:00,13728,"That's the one I use too Garry. Mine's rated to .041"".....051"" with the adapter."
742946,Rich Nelson,2012-11-09 23:37:00,332, X2. Dont go with thinner wire if you dont have to.
742992,Christopheraaron,2012-11-10 02:56:00,3525,"Thanks for the video Will, only thing I noticed is that the wraps wer pretty far apart, but I suppose I could move the grove in the wood"
743105,Christopheraaron,2012-11-10 22:28:00,3525,"Alright, I  figured it out (but i'll still stop by for a visit 2rs), i just put a screwdriver in a vice and wrap the wire around. then put the eye in the vice and wrap the wire by hand with gloves.   "
