464364,Leecher,2010-05-08 19:21:00,7832,"When the sun is shinning everything's fine.... but when it rains..... all hell brakes loose  Just can't believe how this day is unfolding so far  When I got up this morning, it was pouring rain out and the wind was gusting pretty hard.  Went down stairs to start a pot of coffee and went to the relief room.... started to hear dripping sound hitting metal coming from the outside, actually I thought it was from the inner wall..... thought to myself.... this is not normal.  Checked through the kitchen window and water was coming over the rain gutter    Thought to myself.... OK the drain from the gutter is clogged.... no problems, when the rain stops, I'll just try to unglogg it.  Then it hit me.... if the water is coming over the gutter's edge and it's dripping along the outside wall and onto the hydro meter.... better check the basement for some leaks.... Rush down to the basement to check it..... wrong wordwater made it's way inside  So I went upstairs to get paper towel and laid it along the wall where the water made it's way and proceed to think of a plan to unclog the gutter's drain....  Don't own a ladder long enough to reach it so I rigged an old fishing rod with a hook at the end and see if I could manage to remove some debris..... I managed to remove a piece of tree branch that was jammed between the gutter's end and the wall..... once removed.... water that was trapped started to gush out even more..... now here I'm thinking, well that's a smart move Einstein  This is where the water was coming out and where I removed the twig.  You can see that there some little debris stuck to the vinyl    It was still raining while I was doing that and got a little wet from it     My next attempt would be from the upstairs bathroom window but had to wait for the rain to stop..... so as soon as it stopped, went at it..... to my surprise, the gutter's drain was clogged with pigeon droppings     actually the whole gutter was littered with it  I remove the screen from the upstairs bathroom window and opened it.... with the rod, poked the drain hole and after a few tries was successful     Was i ever happy to see the water finally drain by itsef..... now when that was all said and done, I looked over to the other end of the roof and this is what I see    Not sure where this is coming from but how many times do you check the roof for this kind of stuff..... to tell you the truth I never check that but may be I should of  Here's another shot and you can see the pigeon droppings all over the roof    Here you can see the bottom of the gutter and it's real disgusting    So this is the way my day unfolded so far and I'm not one bit happy about it.... actually I'm peeved right off  Leechman"
464384,Twocoda,2010-05-08 20:06:00,4130,"Good thing your a handy guy Leechman....youve got a roofing project ahead of you very shortly ....  Look on he bright side....at least you didnt run out of crap tickets in the ""relief room"""
464652,Fishing 24/7,2010-05-09 18:22:00,709,srry to say this jaques but your roof is all rotten to nithing.  under those shingles all you pressed wood has nothing left to it.  1- do not step on it. or you will go thru.  2- removed FINISHED shingles.  3- change rotton pressed wood.  4- lay down new plywood .  5- lay down new shingles.  6- extend that gutter that is drainning on your roof straight in the other gutter. so that no rain water does not hit your small roof.  7- cry because this is a 500$ + job
464654,Gerritt,2010-05-09 18:32:00,6129,"be sure to add ice and water shield, as well as drip edge under you're shingles.I would also extend the upper downspout to the lower gutter, and add an elbow at the end, to prevent this from happening in the future. Seems as though the lower gutter does not have enough slope toward the drain, as it is holding quite a bit of water."
464675,Fishing 24/7,2010-05-09 20:20:00,709,   exelent advice!  add another 100$ jaques so thats 600$ not so bad!
464717,Whitespinnerbait,2010-05-10 00:19:00,2038,  WOW...  Them Pigeon Droppings sure seem acidic.....it appears they burned right into the shingles...
464731,Leecher,2010-05-10 00:52:00,7832," Now that would of been the icing on the cake wouldn't it   Yeah I was real bummed out when I saw this but hey, only one thing to do is to remove the shingles and have a look to assess the damage.  Thanks Kevin for your great advice   Thanks Gerrit for your great advice     Once I was able to unclog the drain, the water flushed out just like flushing a toilet.  I've never had anything in there in the last 7 years..... looks like I'll have to look out for the dam pigeons   That side of the house is exposed to sun all day.... facing south.  I think the damage resulted from sun exposer..... who knows"
464734,skeeter,2010-05-10 01:03:00,1907,"dont be too pissed off, look at the brighter side.... atleast you were not on a 2 week vacation when this started!!!!!!! and you caught it fast."

464972,walleyejigger,2010-05-10 21:46:00,876,"nice fish, and you turned a NF thread into a F thread, bonus points"
465014,Leecher,2010-05-10 23:02:00,7832," Thanks WJ     Yeah I know..... I only seemed to be hooking into those beauties one at a time this year     Go figure   but for what it's worth.... here's a shot of the obstacles I had to deal with after she inhaled my Mepps #2 black furry.... You can clearly see the underwater structure and tree on surface    Had a good hook set on the upper right of the next pic  just a little past the birch tree that's laying on bottom    and another shot    Here it is again with my head chopped off a little    Not a long one 14"" but very thick and chubby    One good thing is that there was no bugs out to drive us crazy 6 hours of fishing and was able to go around the lake 3 times to finally hook into this brute     Everything was white early morning and by the time I left.... all gone Thanks again WJ and GO HABS GO Leechman"
