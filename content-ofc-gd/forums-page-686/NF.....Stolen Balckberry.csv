465336,bigbuck,2010-05-11 20:09:00,2449,Call Bell's customer service line up and see if they can do anything for you. You might be eligible for a hardware upgrade.
465338,Ben_Daniels,2010-05-11 20:16:00,435,"Seeing as your in the GTA I would recommend NOT getting a new one through bell/rogers, they screw you when your under contract and need a new phone, tried to charge me $200 for a basic phone. There's tons of little electronics stores especially downtown that have phones that they unlock and set up for you for cheap I'm sure you can find the balckberry you want for a lot less than bell, I got my Palm Treo for $50 and they connected it for free at a little store on danforth.  -Ben"
465417,robertag,2010-05-11 23:55:00,42," I bought an unlocked GSM phone from this place once.  It was ""grey"" market at best.  When powered-up, it showed the Sprint logo.  It also died within a few months.  and only comes with a 90 guarantee. Just make sure you're OK with that."

465588,Dusky,2010-05-12 15:57:00,310,"Ebay is your best bet, get one from here or states with a clean ESN. Alternatively Kijiji is full of those."
