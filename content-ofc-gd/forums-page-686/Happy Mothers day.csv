464795,lew,2010-05-10 11:37:00,12766,Hilarious stuff Joe !!  In our entire lives my brother and I only ever had one argument but it was so long ago I can't even remember what it was about.  I was 10 and Ed was 9 and for whatever reason I took a swing at him but he ducked and I hit him on top of his head and broke 2 of MY fingers.  He joked about it for decades later that he beat me up without ever taking his hands outta his pockets
