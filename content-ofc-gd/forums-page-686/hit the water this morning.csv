Cold, windy, cloudy and the waves around Powell's were trying to hit the 2' level with the wind howling straight up the river at that point. Pretty calm though when we were out of the wind. Since not a bight was had I have to assume that even the sheephead were not too nuts about leaving the water for a visit above the surface to see what the weather was like. I am surprised at how low the water is this spring  Gravel and beach shoreline sections are exposed to look like it could be late season after a long drought.  Next time look out fish!"

Was down to the river yesterday and the water is a least 6 ft lower than normal. boat dealers and repair shops are probably rubbing there hands together in anticipation of a banner year. Be careful out there, especially on the Ottawa."
