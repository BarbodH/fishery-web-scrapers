465441,Mykester,2010-05-12 00:52:00,241,"I was slightly more north of there and it was the greatest fishing I've ever had. There are tons of smaller lakes in the area which seem to be only accessible by canoe, but there are big lakes too. The smallmouth were hitting a worm under the float like crazy."
