465237,ctranter,2010-05-11 14:50:00,543,"Great bows, great tunes...great times"
465246,steelhead197,2010-05-11 15:22:00,38,"Great vid!! I just hope you were on private property, as I would guess that that ""Forked"" run, will be packed next year!! Did you guys end up bettering your PB's? Also...I have heard that song in a lot of fishin video's....great tune!! Gotta love the rage! Good job!"
465248,Bondar,2010-05-11 15:31:00,817,"wow thanks , it even has the river name in it man you guys make this to easy for me and my 10, 000 friends to find good fishing spots thanks"
465280,Mykester,2010-05-11 17:12:00,241,Why does every video posted here have RATM?
465288,FlyGuy5,2010-05-11 17:55:00,101,The spot in which I was fishing is private property and only 2 people including myself get permission to fish this land so it no worries to me. Sad part it got to the point where someone was charged for tresspassing and there are signs all over saying no tresspassing keep out.
465291,Roy,2010-05-11 18:10:00,13728, So is the third dude in the clip a trespasser?
465293,FlyGuy5,2010-05-11 18:18:00,101,No I'm allowed to bring a few people when I go. Its a great spot I've been fishing it for over 8 year now.

465484,ctranter,2010-05-12 03:14:00,543,I guess people would rather hear cliche classic rock than cliche modern rock?  Things never change
