464478,Whitespinnerbait,2010-05-09 00:29:00,2038,An Absolutely Gorgeous Boat.........       Congratulations Dude..........
464579,packrat,2010-05-09 13:09:00,93,Just finished reading this whole thread-----what a fascinating story and a amazing looking ride at the end
464584,fish_fishburn,2010-05-09 13:39:00,1311,"Aniceguy, that boat in the driveway would be killing me right now. Just remember if those other two props don;t fair out to your liking, give the tempest a shot. You can just borrow one from your Merc dealer to try. There fast."
464585,kickingfrog,2010-05-09 13:44:00,8333,THAT'S IT!!! I'm blamin' this cold snap on aniceguy and his new boat sitting in the driveway and all.  It really make you shake your head sometimes doesn't it? Fishin' one weekend flat calm and 25 degrees... snow and wind the next.  ... and it still surprises you sometimes.
464587,FUSION,2010-05-09 13:51:00,81,The boat looks great Louis! Looking forward to getting out on the water with you.
464596,Handlebarz,2010-05-09 14:40:00,3790,Very nice looking ride Louie congrats I cant wait to see the next round of pics from her on the water.
465180,aniceguy,2010-05-11 11:40:00,1094,"Well the first quasi warranty issue came up  3 of the hatches wouldnt close properly.  2 were no secure and i wouldnt lock at all. It took a 2 minute call to the factory to tell me exactly what it is, how to fix it and an I ll wait in case you need me to send you a new latch."
465419,pooch,2010-05-11 23:57:00,139,Very nice Louis!  Where did you get that rubber grommet? I have had no luck locating such a thing.
465425,BillM,2010-05-12 00:10:00,17367,East shore Lake E smallmouth?  Bring it!!!!!!  Awesome boat dude!
465429,aniceguy,2010-05-12 00:16:00,1094,"redfishin I bought the grommet in of all places a Canadian Tire store, in the self serve bins I imagine HD or Rona have it too.  years back I saw it and said humm that would finish a hole one day, bcb is sending me the aluminum shell, dunno if I ll switch it  Bill can you be here Sunday morning say 5  call me"
461567,HTHM,2010-04-30 14:16:00,4082,"No, he who laughs last...thinks slowest"
461594,kickingfrog,2010-04-30 16:09:00,8333, I don't get it.
461621,fish_fishburn,2010-04-30 17:24:00,1311,"Thats it, my next boat will be a 21ft Basscat, 250XS."
461623,Roy,2010-04-30 17:32:00,13728,XS AKA as excess describes it quite accurately.
461626,Aaron Shirley,2010-04-30 17:36:00,655,Nice ride Louis! Pretty cool to see it built n stages.
463375,aniceguy,2010-05-06 00:04:00,1094,"this has been like waiting for your first date, a cold beer on a hot day and way more, somethings I swear its like sitting on pins and needles to see, hear or get news on the boat thats waiting for you to come become friends.  Well it arrived earlier this week in Canada and had to go through a PDI...the batteries are installed and charged the trailer is inspected the hull id numbers are on and the plates are coming in the morning, Friday we becomes formally introduced and of course she gets wet the first time ( wait that didnt sound right )  Boat arrived flawless other then the voltage meter not working, and again here is bass cat for ya, rather then have Mercury send a replacement and take 2 weeks the dealer communicated with Bass cat and over night she comes  Other then that this cat is waiting to purr a few pictures from her in Canada  I think the true colors of the boat are finally coming out as they should    I ll have a really good slr to take some decent pics hopefully Friday night and I finally see it with the windshields    I think this image shows the curves and profiles of the boat    a close up of the rescue ladder and a decent indication of the charcoal color  "
463381,irishfield,2010-05-06 00:19:00,26272,That Upper Canada... way out in the booonies on #7....
463384,aniceguy,2010-05-06 00:27:00,1094,yes it is Wayne
463389,irishfield,2010-05-06 00:36:00,26272,Just checkin before I load up the tools....    (I'll be going right by there with my 34' deck trailer in the next couple days...)
463392,HTHM,2010-05-06 00:39:00,4082,Boy!! you must be excited! I'll wait for your PM.... I am envious!
463406,aniceguy,2010-05-06 01:14:00,1094,well if its Friday between say 12 and 2 maybe a cold one is in order
463434,Dutch,2010-05-06 02:13:00,831,"Boat looks great, Friday can't come soon enough for you, I'm sure."
463484,Billy Bob,2010-05-06 11:14:00,5865,FRIDAY.....just in time for a fish fry....
463658,JohnF,2010-05-06 19:33:00,3494," I think if I was taking delivery of that puppy this weekend I'd just be looking for some flat water where I could make sure it's gonna burn gas okay at high speed and not chine walk me outa my undershorts. There's also the matter of determining that the GPS is functioning properly. That means getting into the best testing speed range - 75+ mph. This kind of testing needs to be done over a period of hours so it's probably best if the gas tank(s) is/are run dry just to make sure it's run long enuf. That might not leave any time for fishing. Besides, the rods and tackle may throw off the balance and/or make the boat too heavy for proper speed trials - but there's a whole lifetime left for that.  JF"
463679,aniceguy,2010-05-06 20:11:00,1094," I was looking for flat water initially I was going to run from PC to niagara and break it in that way, then belwood came into the plan much more stable weatehr wise, with the 35k winds I think the driveway is all its gonna see, although if Im back in time I might drop it in pc for a 40 minute check 4 blade trophy dont think even with it broke in I lll see 75 plus even with a 25 fury I bought and am sending to get blueprinted I doubt I ll see 75 then"
463681,irishfield,2010-05-06 20:14:00,26272,I'd be taking it up the road with one of Uppers lads for the first run. Why haul it away from there if any issues arise?
463696,JohnF,2010-05-06 20:37:00,3494, Sucks when the weather man rains on a perfectly good parade. Bet that'll drive you nuts having it just sit on the driveway. It would me.  JF
463762,HTHM,2010-05-06 23:41:00,4082,That's why we own rain gear...
463791,aniceguy,2010-05-07 00:37:00,1094,"Wayne not really worried, warranty is never far away lol......thats a consideration too, dunno  Igotta cut the grass in the am and see where it leads me"
463823,Guest gbfisher,2010-05-07 01:35:00,0,  Your niceboat is in the driveway and yer gonna moe the lawn in the am. Have you paid for that or is the cheque in the mail?
463988,fish-miester,2010-05-07 14:50:00,864,its friday!
464076,aniceguy,2010-05-07 19:19:00,1094,"its here covered sadly, I ll post pics of the unique feartures soon, but the trailer is beyond sweet no sway like a rock down the road"
464079,Dara,2010-05-07 19:46:00,3052,"For running in cold weather its nice to wear a full face snowmobile helmet.   Cutting the grass,,,thats funny"
464412,aniceguy,2010-05-08 21:38:00,1094,"well its home and I spent the day ( in this lousy weather ) buttoning a few things up and sitting and exploring the entire boat  I found more interesting things about the boat  in one of the compartments is this approx 7 inch compartment its purpose to securely, safely store your boat papers in a waterproof dry area    so a nice 12v adaptor comes with it and stuck right into it is this nice rechargable thumb light, perfect for a pinch and it also has a red night light attached    One thing that drove me nuts was the landing net, where to store it so it didnt bang around everywhere when your running around in the boat, solution a chamber right in the middle of the passanger compartment    I always hated docking it, cleats on the back and front but nothing ever in the middle, simple a set of pop up cleats in front of the consoles...    guages especially gas ones sometimes fail so is the tank half full or half empty BCB figured that out too there is a windo to the tank so you can visually look  to see where you are with gas    The only thing not completed at the factory was the physical install of a ram mount for the 997 on the dash, its molded into the console so it should fit like a jem.  Rather then run the cables under the console I opted to cut a plug out install a grommet and run everything like that, it was a pleasure as the wiring was easy as pudding pie to figure out    A cool feature also is how there is a 3 bank genesis charger for the trolling motor and also a pro mite single charger for the main cranking battery, in the event say you ran the electronics but didnt take a long enough run to recharge your main batery over night simple charge it and go !!!!!  Finally a nice picture of the install of the 997 on the dash easy view of all the guages and a good view of the front of the boat    Thats all, I need to get it out and run it"
464430,lew,2010-05-08 22:54:00,12766,You've got a sweet ride now Louie and you sound like a happy man !!   Goodonya
461173,fish_fishburn,2010-04-29 12:55:00,1311,Personally I was thinking around 40k. Thats a gorgeous boat Niceguy. Now run down to your dealer and buy a couple of cases of oil haha. And another thing. Arn't you glad you didn't buy a Triton? Cause there junk if you ask me.
461175,aniceguy,2010-04-29 12:58:00,1094,HTHM sure that would be cool  Mike you think Eddy can strap it onto the float plane.lol......I lost 10 pounds already so I can cram more gear for the trtip  FF I dunno I had a triton and was extremly happy with it
461204,JohnF,2010-04-29 14:27:00,3494,It sure is purdy.  JF
461208,bigbuck,2010-04-29 14:55:00,2449,"Ok, BassCat is not the Ferrari of bassboats, Allison is (but they are kinda narrow and not the roomiest). BUT, that said, BassCat is definitely the Corvette (fast and comfy) of bassboats out there. WOW, $45k for it, awesome boat, awesome price! You had better enjoy that baby out there."
461213,anders,2010-04-29 15:09:00,1168,very nice looking boat...congrats  interested in seeing how fast that boat will go...75 mph?
461369,aniceguy,2010-04-29 21:13:00,1094,"Maybe it was timing or maybe I jolted a process into action or maybe non of the above, but it appears that Bass Cat boats is wanting to take a more active approach to documenting the process of building to a specific client by tracking a boat by serial numbers  To that they set up a facebook site that will be a stratagic process in doing what they did for me in depth to other retail clients.  Goes to show you just how they think here is thier face book site enjoy, for the fiberglass guys there are a lot of different pictures of my boat in layup and such  http://www.facebook.com/pages/Bass-Cat-Boats-by-Serial-Number/106283106080215"

460684,lookinforwalleye,2010-04-28 02:04:00,4399,probably cost as much as my first house!!
460685,aniceguy,2010-04-28 02:06:00,1094, so whats everyones guess on cost
460687,HTHM,2010-04-28 02:08:00,4082,"Around $43,000"
460688,irishfield,2010-04-28 02:10:00,26272,$47.5 + taxes
460691,lookinforwalleye,2010-04-28 02:18:00,4399,I`ll say 57 thousand unless of course they are discounting the crap out of them because of the economy.  BTW 57K is what I paid for my first house!
460710,Banger68,2010-04-28 02:37:00,157,Around $50K
460721,Nipfisher,2010-04-28 02:50:00,2449,"I'll set the top of the envelope and guess $61,000 all incl. Boat and accessories alone has to be $40 - $45. Motor is worth a pretty penny and then add the trailer. I figure my boat is worth $61....($6100)!"
460728,kickingfrog,2010-04-28 03:04:00,8333,"I'll bid a dollar, Bob."

460846,bigbuck,2010-04-28 16:02:00,2449,"I'd guess pushing 60k. It's an expensive toy but hey, you only live once right??"
460864,Terry,2010-04-28 16:43:00,14456,40 something

460868,Roy,2010-04-28 17:05:00,13728,"$1,000. down Luis?  It makes no difference to anyone how much it costs. Or at least it shouldn't. What IS important is what it's WORTH to the person buying it."
460912,Harrison,2010-04-28 19:10:00,2202,"I figure the cost is one heck of a ""honey to do list"".  10 chores a month for 15 years.  Close???  Seriously, I am going with High 40's."

Lots of pictures today so I ll keep them simple and easy but suffice to say the boat needs gas oil and me and she is good to go.  Here is a decent pic of the dashes on the boat    a really neat side shot of the boat    a nice close up of the pro xs on the jack plate.. nice tiny engine..... it shouldnt be that fast    a nice full on side shot of the boat    the straps securing it to the trailer for fork lifting onto a flat bed for the ride up    and FINALLY THE FINISHED PRODUCT out for its first flirt with sunshine......my completed boat!!!!!!!!      I will have more when its delivered...  I hope that you all enjoyed sharing this process with me, like i said I bought my first bass boat off this site and sold a boat o this site, so I truely hope that it was an enjoyable process now eat my roster tail    So the question of cost...........................  A comparable  19 foot triton equipted like mine would have run 50k plus A comparable 19 foor ranger close to 60k plus   The ferrari of bass boats and without argument the best built one on the market........$44800  Cheaper and better built then any other ride out on the market...............

461049,solopaddler,2010-04-29 01:42:00,8605,Sweet! Now you just need a real truck to pull it.  (I wonder what it would cost to have it airlifted into the Attawapiskat in June?  )

460317,aniceguy,2010-04-27 11:39:00,1094," lew I have heard good and bad on it, mostly failures of the aluminum etc....11 days to water test I hope"
460319,lew,2010-04-27 11:49:00,12766," That's the 1st time I've heard of any problems with the aluminum Louis, do you have any other info on it ??  My Fortrex was new with the boat last summer and I was on the water nearly every day from the beginning of May right thru to the fall and never had any issues with anything."
460327,TJQ,2010-04-27 12:21:00,7806,Holy Moly... great updates!! Nice boat for sure!!
460330,aniceguy,2010-04-27 12:28:00,1094, I had a conversation with someone last yr on lower buckhorn during a tourney and he went on and on how he went through a few of them and had major issues with the structural integrity. Your using it with no issues paints the opposite picture that it is reliable  glad to hear that as that was a point of thought on it.thanks Lew  TJ glad your liking the updates as much as I am
460348,lew,2010-04-27 13:01:00,12766," Strikes me as odd Louie that one person would go thru ""a few of them"" and have major issues when everyone else is very satisfied. Almost makes me think he must be awful rough on his gear.  I put far more hours on my boat than most guys do and so far the Fortrex has been flawless.....touch wood  Anyways, I'd say you can have full confidence that it'll work flawlessly for you too."
460350,aniceguy,2010-04-27 13:02:00,1094, perfect Lew jsut what I needed to hear
460354,Harrison,2010-04-27 13:21:00,2202,"Ok, I can't do the whole thread... too much drool.  Awesome boat bud!  You'll love it!  And good call on the longer shaft troller!"
460406,charlesn,2010-04-27 15:51:00,551,"Lew, you may have the newer model.  From what I heard a lot of guys with the first generation ones were complaining.  Enough so that I decided to keep my maxxum for now.  Your experience is more what I expect from Minn Kota products as I am a die-hard convert from Motorguide, but every manufacturer can put out a dud and MK has had a couple in the recent past.  The genesis was a huge flop and the first generation Fortrex had a lot of issues.  Just google Minn Kota Fortrex problems to see...  I would also say the bounce buster they have on there now needs to be replaced with a RAM style one asap.  Lew, another thing is the bodies of water that you fish on.  Most of the problems I've heard of for ANY boat brand relates to great lakes fishing and the associated pounding of the boat involved.  Charles"
460459,aniceguy,2010-04-27 18:01:00,1094,Wow wait until I get home and post today's update unreal pics today  ram mount eh Charles. Good idea Ill have to get one since my last one is in buckhorn some one dropped it over board lol
460461,fish-miester,2010-04-27 18:12:00,864,jeeze hurry up with the new pics !
460477,charlesn,2010-04-27 19:07:00,551," Hahaha.  You know you have no one to blame but yourself once you let me touch something mechanical in nature - it's gonna break, explode or fall to the bottom of the lake.  That's just how I roll."
460515,aniceguy,2010-04-27 20:56:00,1094,  true I ll remember that one..ohh on that note Al if you notice a tiny scratch on the bottom of the hull of the hornet. the only scratch I might ad thats due to Charles not mentioning we were about to drift over a house sized boulder
460520,cityfisher,2010-04-27 21:08:00,959,"slick ride, keep the updates coming"
460521,aniceguy,2010-04-27 21:11:00,1094,"Well it appears Im getting really close to the end of the build and the beginning of the journey with the boat. I wanted to say something here to anyone reading.  From time to time it comes up about joining a bass club fishing in a tournament etc.  A few back while I loved bass fishing I never contemplated buying a rig and fishing touraments with any fevor.  I fished a few and got bit, on this great site I found my first bass boat and also sold my boat and got more into the bass bug thanks to guys like Charles N JP and lots more, its a culture a community and pretty much not a bad sort in the mix.  the evolution of it is now I researched the right rig and bought it.  Im not a pro just a joe who loves fishin and now I have a rig that is a 10 on the sweeeet factor.... thanks more to come  PICTURES!!!!!!!! here is a really nice picture of the trolling motor and the 788 on the bow of the boat, Im lovin the cArpet    here i can see the seat the hot foot and other items still no steering wheel but Im sure as I press send its done too   In this picture you really get to see just how body conforming the seats are, also the throttle a cable for the hot foot and the center seat which isint a seat but an area to hide a throw cushion.  I am having BCB send me a seat there thanks JP if I didnt speak to rick after you and I talked I might not have asked so a seperate seat is on the way for my kids    The sats look very comfortable and with my frame and some of the 100 mile plus runs in it im sure it will be a welcome creature comfort    What do you think of the seat colors?  Something is getting vaccumed here I assume some carpet trim, but look its not on a dolly any longer, god I love the styling on the hull    Sadly in this image it sits without an engine and is waiting for the pro xs to bolt on, its going to be a tough fisrt few hours on the break in to not pin the puppy    and finally a really nice shot of the trailer    Well when we spoke today BCB said that as these pics came the engine was rigged so by 5 tonight I would say the covers are on and she is buttoned up scheduled for the drive from Arkansas to Detroit some time tommorrow morning  More pics of the finished product to come  "

460536,Billy Bob,2010-04-27 21:48:00,5865,LOOKING VEEEERY GOOOOOD............  Now I have to ask the HARD question........how much...don't need to know exactly but a ball park figure on something like this would be interesting to me (and maybe others)...  Bob
460538,misfish,2010-04-27 21:53:00,29133,"  It would be the best darndest fancy row boat, out there then bud.LOL  It,s looking sweet."
460545,fish-miester,2010-04-27 22:17:00,864,   agreed
460655,aniceguy,2010-04-28 01:22:00,1094," I was wondering when this question was going to come up.....Well when the engine is on and the final factory pc is up I ll tell exactly....until then take a guess, and now knowing its pretty much the best built bass boat out there, the cost wil floor you"
460673,anders,2010-04-28 01:45:00,1168,very NICE!!
460678,Pigeontroller,2010-04-28 01:54:00,2793,"Wow, you must be really enjoying waiting for, and watching such a nice boat being built! I'm not a Bass-boat fan but that sure is one nice looking ride! Since you seem willing to say I'm curious a well on the final price tag."
458125,bigbuck,2010-04-20 14:41:00,2449,That is gonna be one heck of a nice ride when she is completed and hits the water!!! That is really cool of BassCat to send you updated pics of the construction of your boat.
458234,aniceguy,2010-04-20 20:26:00,1094,"day 2 of this god awful cold ro what ever it is....happy to come home and see some additional pictures  I see the front rod lockers are installed and good to go, looks like he is working on the controls or the gas tank? I see also that finally the bass cat logo's are on the hull in bright gold     In this picture I can see that the the storage compartments are done, they have wrapped the boat for protection, the vent is in and the PSI guage I asked for is installed    Finally I got to see another part of the missing componant the fenders, which are the same color remmington steel as the cap, I think they look sweet   With this weather I cant tell ya how antsy I am to get this new boat home, although Ill miss the daily updates I ll just go and watch it in the driveway"
458245,HTHM,2010-04-20 21:08:00,4082,Keep 'em coming! I am LOVING this!

458350,kickingfrog,2010-04-21 02:22:00,8333,"WOW! That looks really fast even without an engine.  Possible first conversation in new boat, yelled over the noise from the engine and roar of the air traveling past your ears:  I said ""Do I have a bug in my teeth?"""
458412,aniceguy,2010-04-21 12:34:00,1094,  I have on a few situations been known to have to floss upon getting home.... it is a unique thread I dont think I have seen one where a boat build was documented from start to finish ever in this detail  that I can recall
458424,msp,2010-04-21 13:24:00,1336,Thats amazing. A very interesting thread. I have heard nothing but great things about Bass Cat. If you need any new fishing partners......... dont hesitate to call me !!

458956,aniceguy,2010-04-23 12:25:00,1094,"Corporate culture is a funny thing, either you have it or you dont. In todays society there are far too many corporations who's only intent is to bilk you the consumer.  BASS CAT is a complete opposite never too busy to talk, or answer a question more then willing to send me daily updates and when I wanted something minor changed it was done immediately without cost.  I asked them is this thier norma policy and the answer was that this is how they do things they dont know any other way, a customer is always right and deserves to be happy with the purchase  So todays pictures look like a lot more finishing was done, the throttle was installed as was the trolling motor and the back vent stickers ect, looks like all the rigging hose is on and all we are waiting now is for the engine for those bored with this thread sorry but for those that are into this process as much as I am enjoy todays pictures      feel free to post your comments on specifics of the build"

459211,DRIFTER_016,2010-04-24 02:42:00,10439,Is that one of them ski boats they use to chase them little green fish?
459257,fish_fishburn,2010-04-24 11:28:00,1311,"She's really taking shape nice guy. I really like the colour combo you selected. Looks very classy. Say look at me aint I purty, but doesn't yell LOOK AT ME, if you know what I mean. Is this your first bassboat?"
459280,pooch,2010-04-24 14:38:00,139,"Great post!  When I was researching bass boats, bass cat seemed to always come to the top in terms of quality and innovation. You are going to be happy with that boat for many years to come. I love the colours and choices you've made so far. Sweet rig.  I'm thinking that boat fully loaded will be unlikely to get past 70 mph. Add full live wells and a hefty fishing partner and 65 would be more likely. Fast enough, but don't want you to be disappointed on the top speed when you finally get her in the water. Fingers crossed I'm way wrong. Empty her out lift and trim it up and 73 is possible. I've heard those hulls are fast fast fast and stable. Did you buy through Upper Canada?  Cheers and keep the updates coming."
459281,LucG,2010-04-24 14:39:00,779,"Yeah, sure is a nice boat!"
459387,aniceguy,2010-04-24 23:37:00,1094," thanks I appreciate the compliment, I was very uncertain on the colors but after the reasearch itreally made sense.    65 would be a dissappointment, 70 would be fine and anything above 73 would be sweet bonus....I heard and reasearched the same on the hulls, brand loyalty and as far as I have been told the best of the best in terms of a bass boat too"
460196,aniceguy,2010-04-27 00:49:00,1094,"well after a few days the anticipation was killing me knowing that Bass cat has some new pictures.  Todays pictures showcased the front deck ( first time I saw it so far) in full completion carpeted and with the 101 fortex installed  The trolling motor looks a bit daunting with a 52 shaft but in the angle it stands out for sure     And finally an updated view of the dash with all the gages including a psi guage Im sure soon I ll see the steering wheel  Looks like the trailer, the engine and some minor button ups and its good to get shipped this Thursday  The chrome bezels look really sweet "
456846,aniceguy,2010-04-16 21:13:00,1094," Honestly Mike you dont need great gear and its 60 to join a club and roughly 100 or so to fish a tourny, lots of great guys who will happily share gear and stuff, unless you draw Charles and your trolling senko's all day you ll learn a pile"
456847,aniceguy,2010-04-16 21:14:00,1094,"Billy when I sold my 111 and 102 I was thinking that was the way to go, I started to shop it and realized I was around a 2k difference and thought for 2 k I can buy a lot of other things."
456852,Billy Bob,2010-04-16 21:22:00,5865, Very Good Point...  2K buys a LOT of expensive gasoline...:<(
456855,aniceguy,2010-04-16 21:24:00,1094,Billy Bob Im hoping to see  the side scan on a lowrance this summer on someones boat and see how it really compared with the humminbird it will be interesting
456856,ecmilley,2010-04-16 21:24:00,2163,awesone boat bass cat is on my short list of new bass boats if and when i can purchase a new boat. whens the fishin trip?
456862,BITEME,2010-04-16 21:32:00,1968,Nice Boat Man!!!!!!!!!!! Very very nice
456920,fish_fishburn,2010-04-17 00:06:00,1311,Very nice.. What model is it you bought? If you need a good pilot just pm me.
456992,aniceguy,2010-04-17 02:54:00,1094,  its a pantera 2
457004,Kingsalmon,2010-04-17 03:54:00,107,"Very nice boat Louis.  I just have one peev about it.  If you are spending really good money for your custom made boat, why would you allow them to put those standard crappy gauges in the dash.  Surely, Mercury offers better quality gauges I mean seriously.  Everything in that boat is top notch equipment and those things are relics.  Just think about a year or two from now when everything is still looking like new and those gauges look like they are twenty years old.  Sorry I had to say it.  Otherwise, good luck with your baby."
457009,fishnsled,2010-04-17 05:02:00,3520,Very cool to follow along with the progress.   Sweet looking ride.
457012,Gerry,2010-04-17 07:17:00,257,A few years ago I had the pleasure of spending a day on a Pantera II while fishing in a BASS tournament and I can say it was a sweet ride....fast too. And this coming from a guy who had a Triton TR21 at the time. You'll like the Basscat.
457027,fish_fishburn,2010-04-17 11:40:00,1311,Was thinking the same about the guages.... Had the same ones on my 95 Nitro. Water pressure guage went out twice and the tach also a few times. They are by no-means the smart guages.
457037,Billy Bob,2010-04-17 12:19:00,5865, I believe with the Lowrance HDS units you can network in your Merc motor and get many of the reading right on the Lowrance HDS units...but you better check if it's capatable with Merc outboards.
457044,aniceguy,2010-04-17 12:40:00,1094,"I thought about the smart guages, and I can see the merits of it, but 1500 more didnt make sense besides the only guages that are important to me any how are the trim water pressure and tach  Lowrance could network into the guages since i don thave  lowrance units that was another reason for the standard package"
457046,JohnF,2010-04-17 12:45:00,3494, Get a better prop.  JF

457053,aniceguy,2010-04-17 13:02:00,1094," lol.......actually awsome comments, sorta makes me think that I wasnt the only one to think through all the issues........end of the day 14 to 16 days and its here....  JF thats the other thing the factory is sending a 26p 4 blade trophy plus, and I ll find a26 fury afterwards"
457081,solopaddler,2010-04-17 14:52:00,8605," Oh, well that's okay then."
457095,Dutch,2010-04-17 15:24:00,831,"Congrats on the new boat.  Bass Cat is a top notch company, builds and supports their boats with total class from what I have read and heard.  You will love it."
457096,JohnF,2010-04-17 15:33:00,3494, Waytago. Do I see a 75 or 76 in yer future? Keep that hull clean son and invite me for a ride one day. Gotta love goin' fast.  JF
457110,aniceguy,2010-04-17 17:02:00,1094,I think I would need to drop 50 eat some re fried beans for afterburner effects run down the niagara river in a 50mile sw wind  to do 75 or 76   my ever expanding girth just wont let me lol
457381,fish_fishburn,2010-04-18 11:55:00,1311,"I would definitely look at the TEMPEST ll prop by merc. It's a three blade, and you will get more top end then any four-blade. A 25 pitch will probably take care of you just fine. If not a 26."
457386,aniceguy,2010-04-18 11:58:00,1094,"the four blade I figured get out of the factory because I want it for rougher water, you think a tempest? I have been reading that those fury props are almost a perfet fit for the p2"
457939,aniceguy,2010-04-19 21:54:00,1094,"It was a tough weekend with me having kids baseball, while suffering through a mid Spring cold/ flu or anything in between. Here i am just a common Joe not a pro but a single paying customer.  the chap from Bass Cat that was sending me daily updates on my build was on holiday and I though there goes my updates so bummed I was a bit.  Today Im sitting and trying to wait until the buckleys kicks in ( ya it does suck) and I see on my phone an update on a bass fishing site of my build in progress, nope the pictures were not emialed to me rather they them selves posted them on an internet site.....  talk about taking the next step in customer support....  Anyhow I see soe good progress was made but what really impressed me is the true colors are showing now  The Charcoal color and the remington steel of the cap are much more accurate.  I think Im going to extend a blog on this build and build it to a multi year excercise on the cat and Milo.....  Sorry if this is boring but for those that like this sort of post...............enjoy  The back of the hull again the colors are much better and I see some awsome progress     a somewhat more slanted view of the hull...lookin sweet  "
457970,Leecher,2010-04-19 23:10:00,7832,Awesome aniceguy Very nice of them to send you pics to see the progress Looking real good!!! Leechman
456457,aniceguy,2010-04-15 20:27:00,1094,"A while back I started the process of trying to sell my boat and buy another, the entire time I thought a marginal jump in cost made sense, so off I went.  I scoured the US and Canada for the right fit and boat, maybe im picky dunno but I just couldntfind the right product, I thought i did recently but realized via an engine report it was a ticking time bomb.  So my wife sat me down annd said "" just buy a new one already"" So off I went searching for the right boat for me.  After researching talking to some very knowledgable Bass guys there was no doubt in my mind that Bass Cat was the maker of my new boat The talk family business, customer loyalty, the premier boat buidler JD and Power winner. Well as I go through the process I get it. Im not a pro angler simply a regular Joe yet everytime I talk to the company I feel as if Im the only client they ever had...talk about a great feeling!!!!  Im seriously am understanding  the loyalty cat owners have to the brand.  Im in a business that is brand loyal and by far and I ll say heads and leaps the people at BCB are ahead of the curve on other builders big.!!!!!  Every time I had a question it was recieved and answered fully, they are doing additional rigging without hesitation and are just a god send to deal with.  I had some emails sent today of my build I ll have more as time goes closer to the delivery date...  Im going to try and keep it going for those that have some interest and a longer term blog on the boat and what I do with it.  the hull ou tof the mold     the cap out of the molds     When it was said that its a family company I understand, as I felt like I was talking to a brother today down there!!! the initial  progress, this is awsome as I intend to document the entire process      I thought this was neat as it appears the cooler section is divided into two sections and seperates drinks from food    a really nice side view of the hull    and finally the completed unit!!!!!!!!    todays pictures sent hopefully Im not boring anyone, the wiring has begun, they recieved all my cables and are starting to attach them.  The cosole will be neat as you see there is a recess for a ram mount built into it so the 997 will be front and center.  I also added some back up lights my logic was that it will be real easy seeing a skinny ramp dark in the mornings  here is the wiring harness for the boat    Here is a neat shot of the process of drilling out the rod locker for the rod organizers to go in    the console as I said with the recessed part for the ram mount and the holes for the smart craft guages    the beginnings of the wiring process on the front deck by the foot pedal    finally a nice shot of the entire hull    Enjoy  I think I put every single option on it I could for the most part so it is a "" no need to buy anything"" boat and Im sitting on pins waiting until May to get it...I ll post more as I get them from the factory"
456460,Banger68,2010-04-15 20:33:00,157,That is awesome being able to see your boat come together peice by peice. I'm excited enough just getting one off the dealers floor. Getting the step by step must be really getting you anxious.

456759,aniceguy,2010-04-16 16:49:00,1094,"Well bass cat is coming to the completion of the boat itself and is waiting for the engine to rig it,  it should be carpetted today and then can rest a bit here is the front of my dash with the 788 on it, I have a new one here at home that I ll more then likely sell at some point as this one is direct from the factory the remington steel color is more pronounced today  I just love how the troling motor is intrigated into the entire hull here, its a far up on the bow so I ll need to get use to that  I can see how if I stuff the bow on a wave its of no consequence to anything, pretty sleek on the front end     I asked for 4 aluminum battery trays and it just makes the bilge look smart, lots of wires and room in there for sure    even without the steering wheel it looks super sharp with the duel trim for the plate and engine trim, the 997 should look nice into the built in ram mount on the groove    I think in this picture you can begin to see the charcoal of the hull, sweet colors I think, the jack plate is on and wires are run just waiting for the engien to get rigged  I can also see the passanger counsole is added    Finally a finished product sans carpet...every day its like a kid in a candy store on this  "
