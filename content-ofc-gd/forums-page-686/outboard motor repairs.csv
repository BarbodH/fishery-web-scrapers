463870,lovetofish,2010-05-07 03:03:00,500,"I have a 1988 mercury 60hp, a crank bearing siezed, scored the crankshaft, broke a connecting rod and there is a small crack in the intake manifold.  Does anyone know someone who does outboard motor repairs on the side or a good mechanic? or somewhere to get used parts for an older motor like this one?  any help would be greatly appreciated.  thanks,   lovetofish"
463897,skeeter,2010-05-07 04:29:00,1907,Big cliff does outboard work. give him a shout.
463909,Big Cliff,2010-05-07 09:54:00,6899," Sorry, that is a big job and I am so booked up right now I wouldn't even be able to start on it until the fall. As far as ""used parts"" don't bother going there, if you are going to spend the money to have it repaired do it properly. A patch job is just going to cost you more money in the long run."
463951,HTHM,2010-05-07 13:24:00,4082,You may be better off parting that one out and re-powering with a newer motor.
463961,hirk,2010-05-07 14:08:00,571," Scrap it bud,sorry but if the crank is gone your way too far into a repair to ever justify the $'s being a 88."
463969,jedimaster,2010-05-07 14:20:00,3472,"I agree, thats gonna be a tonne of cash just in parts. You could just re buy the motor for less than the parts to fix her up."
