Tried around Gull Island, nothing, tried Mohawk point, nothing. Tried out deep 45 To 60 FTW, nothing. All places we marked fish. Tried trolling the river, caught a couple Sheephead and one BIG Carp, Guess what, no net  . Got the Carp to the boat then reached down to grab the Carp, and snap 6 lb.test , goodbye lure   . Went home with tail between legs. My excuse, to early to antsea. That's all folks, someone else's turn."

465335,Roe Bag,2010-05-11 20:08:00,246,"Seems as though they start earliest in Long Point Bay. Then Ryerse and Dover. Then Nanticoke. Last but not least, Port Maitland. Good numbers on and off east of Dover in the past week or so. Probably show up in Port Maitland in the next week or so. Need on shore winds to bring in the warmer surface water and the baitfish."
