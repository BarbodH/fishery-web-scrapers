Look for north side (warmer) bays with weed growth---minnows are a good bet this time of year (not too big though)
465499,fish_fishburn,2010-05-12 10:37:00,1311,I'm hoping to be going there this friday or saturday. Just waiting for my buddy to get his boat ready. The plan is to fish walleye first thing in the morning and then troll for them beautiful lakers later on. I will let you know how things work out if its worth writing about. Bark can be tough to fish at times but it holds lots of big fish. My pb smallmouth came out of there. 6.5 lbs.
