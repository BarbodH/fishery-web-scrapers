464994,Paully,2010-05-10 22:35:00,712,I had black flies on the brim of my hat 2 weeks ago in toronto..
465004,Mattones,2010-05-10 22:51:00,587,About two weeks ago they were insane;y crazy up in Bracebridge!
465012,Mykester,2010-05-10 23:00:00,241,I remember 5 years ago I destroyed my dads head while they didn't bite me. Maybe they don't attack blonde people?

465186,fish_fishburn,2010-05-11 12:05:00,1311,"There starting here but not to bad yet. Just remember not to wear black at all, it attracts them. And bug dope with 99% deet keeps them at bay, just don't put it on your skin cause its nasty."
465200,otter649,2010-05-11 12:40:00,118,  I was up in Dorset this past weekend (May 07-09) - They were out for a bit but after the temp dropped 15 degrees F or so and with the rain-sleet & snow there was no problem with the bugs after that........

But with Algonquin just haveing a cold snap, and even 10 cm of snow in some areas....I think that will set them back a bit. My guess is we're back into a normal bug rythem"

465541,Bob,2010-05-12 13:27:00,370,"They haven't been bad here yet. Due to the almost zero runoff this spring and the fact that blackflies need running water to breed, I don't anticipate a bad season for them this year.  Again, due to little runoff, I can see a lot of the swamps drying early and an easier skeeter season unless, of course, we get a lot of rain."
