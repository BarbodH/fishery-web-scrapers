449109,squiggy,2010-03-28 14:37:00,14,went to pull the boat out yesterday and discovered that the windscreen on my side console had snapped over the winter under the tarp. does anyone know of a plastics place in the GTA that can form me a new piece for the boat. thanks
449123,squiggy,2010-03-28 15:32:00,14," or a plastics place that could put a couple 90 degree bends in a piece of plastic or lexan, i dont mind changing the shape from the original mounting location"
449130,HTHM,2010-03-28 16:19:00,4082,Try PA plastics in Hamilton. http://www.paplastics.com/
449134,Bass_boy7,2010-03-28 16:24:00,10,I would have to agree they did a good job on my custom windscreen i desgned for my bass boat loved it and price was good too.They will also ship it to you if your farther away and don't want to drive etc.
449146,irishfield,2010-03-28 17:20:00,26272,P & A is good to deal with. I buy all my UHMW from them for ski bottoms.  As for Lexan and a couple 90* bends... any shop with a bending brake can do it for you. Nice thing about lexan vs acrylic.. you can cold bend it.
449154,squiggy,2010-03-28 17:53:00,14,thank you for the link to PA. i'll give them a call next week. thanks for the help

465053,HTHM,2010-05-11 00:47:00,4082,Looks GREAT!
465063,irishfield,2010-05-11 01:00:00,26272,Now there's a guy that's seriously in to his fishing dreams...  
465082,squiggy,2010-05-11 01:34:00,14,"from reading the other thread, the only thing that was cracked on my Tracker was the windscreen"
465362,cpguy29,2010-05-11 21:30:00,148,How much did it cost to get the new one fabricated. I need one made up too.
