464995,muskymatt,2010-05-10 22:36:00,2608,We'll taking pictures is not my best skill  The baits look awesome and while you can make out the gold scale they def. look better close up.  Here's some pictures....let me know what you think!!                
464996,danbouck,2010-05-10 22:37:00,4380,Nice Job
464997,walleyejigger,2010-05-10 22:38:00,876,"very nice good job, look like a pro paint job"
464998,misfish,2010-05-10 22:41:00,29133,Very nice work. Did you ever think of using a white mesh for  scale effect?  Very nice work once again.
465001,muskymatt,2010-05-10 22:45:00,2608, No but good suggestion...I'll have to give it a try!
465002,Syn,2010-05-10 22:46:00,519,
465018,Terry,2010-05-10 23:14:00,14456,Dude   they are great  and at the cost of Muskie baits I think that's the way to go
465019,misfish,2010-05-10 23:22:00,29133, Ill try and find my pics of the ones I did that too.Ethier thier on my work comp or on a disk. The look is awesome.
465041,The JAY,2010-05-11 00:27:00,239,"As an old airbrush instructor, I gotta say you did a nice job. I haven't done much shooting myself lately, but you're making me want to break out the brushes and try making some lures.. Thanks!"
465044,Whitespinnerbait,2010-05-11 00:33:00,2038,"Some Fine,Fine Workmanship right there Matt..."
465095,muskymatt,2010-05-11 01:51:00,2608,Thanks guys...I'll be doing a different paint pattern for the second batch and have another model in the planning..can't wait to give them a toss.  
465100,Whopper,2010-05-11 01:58:00,2174,Well done Matt
465106,backbay,2010-05-11 02:01:00,773,Great looking work; those are sure to hook you up!  :clapping:o
465141,Handlebarz,2010-05-11 02:52:00,3790,nice job Matt they are looking great for sure.
465143,limeyangler,2010-05-11 03:01:00,5204,"Awesome job Matt.  I'm very new to musky fishing..lol..i dont even have my own rod yet.   Hell, Ive only got one musky bait myself...found it on shore a month back...looks quite good"
465204,corvette1,2010-05-11 12:56:00,1765,awesome paint job all you need now are some toothey buggers
465209,Fish Farmer,2010-05-11 13:21:00,2234,"Nice work, for sure."
465211,lew,2010-05-11 13:35:00,12766,"Good stuff Matt, they turned out excellent."
465212,Governator,2010-05-11 13:35:00,879,"Wow those are impressive, well done  Those are some big lips, how deep do they dive?"
465215,muskymatt,2010-05-11 13:45:00,2608," Depending on the retrieve up to 10', they are however best used allowing the bouyancy of the balsa and the weights to give a wounded, rising diving effect. They work well as a twitch bait but can also be used with a steady retrieve, the jointed one has some wicked wobble. Used slow or fast they have great action."
465216,muskymatt,2010-05-11 13:46:00,2608, Lew ....if I sent you one would you give it a good test??
465235,cram,2010-05-11 14:40:00,1733,"Amazing craftsmanship.  I'm a big fan of that colour, Matt.  Good choice.  Do you make 10-12 inch versions?"
465315,lew,2010-05-11 19:24:00,12766," Absolutely Matt, and thanks. Once I get it all slimed & chewed up I'll post the picture to show how well it works  I'll PM you my new address."
465416,mistyriver1,2010-05-11 23:53:00,600,Those look great Matt.  Nice job.
