464808,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-05-10 12:17:00,0,Those are some nice cats. As I was telling my buddy a few years back? Channel cat fishing will become more popular as the years go by. Not only do I think the cash pot will be larger next year? So will the fish.
465029,Greg14,2010-05-11 00:05:00,12,how come that Reg dude has no shirt on? haha
465035,Radnine,2010-05-11 00:16:00,1538,"$816.00 should buy a shirt (the Mayor of Dunville should know better). Steve: I saw your show on Charlie's Fishful thinking on the weekend (I think for the one hundred and twelfth time) and it really looks like you guys had a good time. I have made a new drinking game: You have to take a shot every time Charlie says ""circle hook"". Jim"
