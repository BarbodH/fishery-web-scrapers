I am interested in what experiences any members may like to share, positive or negative, with this boat.  I have pretty much decided on a 18ft Kodiak tiller model with a 60hp engine as my first boat purchase.  I am just snooping around with dealers and pricing trying to see who has the best deals.  Your input is appreciated.  I am a multispecies fisherman and expect to be fishing with my girlfriend a lot.  I want to be able to have us both fish in comfort with decent seating and a flat floor but also have plenty of room and power to get around the lake.  I believe the Kodiak recently replaced the Crestliner Canadian as their basic deep v fishing boat.  It just seems like a better value than comparable Lund or Alumacraft models which I find are more expensive.  Your input is appreciated.  Thanks!  Millhouse2020"
