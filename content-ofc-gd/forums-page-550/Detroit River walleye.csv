Most anglers have been jigging using 3/8 -3/4 oz jigs, chartruese always seems to work well with orange being another good one. With most winds coming out of the N and E this year fishing has been taking place on the Michigan side of the river. Look for things to get better for the next 3 wks as fish will be finished spawning and ready to chow down. This past wknd the Maters Walleye Circuit was in town and 56 of the 112 teams came to the scales with over 30lb bags for 5 walleyes. We finished 7th with 38.27lbs respectivley, the winners had 43.49lbs."

574200,mike rousseau,2011-04-19 19:16:00,4661,That's a normal average for a Lawrence tourney weights... With three fish weigh ins the winner usually has 20-25 lbs
