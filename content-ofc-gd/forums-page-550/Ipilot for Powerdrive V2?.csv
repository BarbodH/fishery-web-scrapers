558650,scugpg,2011-03-06 03:08:00,1373,I'm thinking of getting an ipilot for the relatives Powerdrive V2 but was wondering how the steering is with the Ipilot on that motor. personally I think that is one of the powerdrive's downfalls but was wondering if the Ipilot helps make it a bit more precise vs the pedal
558671,BFSC Kevin,2011-03-06 04:06:00,1351,"fyi, i believe you can't use the foot pedal when using the ipilot for the power drive. but you can for the terrova"
558672,Bob Devine,2011-03-06 04:06:00,251,"Rob, not sure how well it will work on the Power Drive model but no problems with it on a Terrova."
558711,scugpg,2011-03-06 11:15:00,1373,"Thanks for the replies folks. I know its smooth as silk on the Terrova, but not sure how it adapts on the Powerdrive.  That's a great point about not being able to use the pedal; I like having that option as a safety backup.  They're ""trying"" to get away without swapping in a Terrova/IP combo"
558726,mbac31,2011-03-06 12:58:00,904,"It works great but on the Terrova, however. Search this on youtube, a guy in the US has a module made up to work with all minnkota motors with a foot pedal attached."

573847,workwear,2011-04-18 22:43:00,592,i just hooked mine up to my riptide....same connectors as the terrova.........I CAN'T WAIT TO USE IT!!!
