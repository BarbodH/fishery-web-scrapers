573076,Nipfisher,2011-04-16 23:08:00,2449,I was at a local retailer today looking at baitcaster rods to pair up with my Shimano Castaic. I looked at the 6.6 St.Croix Premier series (2 piece) and one made by Jaxon. The seller said it was a Polish company and the rod I was looking at was an Italian design. It was called the Grand Virtuoso. It was 6.6 and was very stiff. Jaxon  I need a 2 piece rod because I will break a one piece rod.  Is Jaxon at all comparable to the St. Croix Premier?   I also looked at the Shimano Convergence rod and a few cheaper models.   Any imput on the rods listed would be great especially the Jaxon product.

I would give it a try, I don't think it's as good as St Croix, but it would be still really good product in my opinion."

573961,Nipfisher,2011-04-19 02:10:00,2449,"  Ya I checked Lefebvres, North Bay Outfitters, Can Tire, and Walmart. Lefebvre's actually had the best selection and best price. Their St. Croix Premiers were $40 cheaper then N.B. Outfitters! Pretty sure I'm going with the Shimano Convergence or the Premier. Compres are nice at Walmart but all 1 piece."
