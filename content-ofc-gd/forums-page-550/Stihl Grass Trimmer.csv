572605,skeeter,2011-04-15 17:42:00,1907,Anyone know where to get a gas tank for the 86 stihl grass trimmer? The one thats on it is the original plastic tank and all the seams have opened up on it. I called a stihl authorised dealer and they want $30.oo just for a tank.
572608,GBW,2011-04-15 17:47:00,8460,did you check Home Hardware Dann?
572611,mercman,2011-04-15 17:52:00,7054,Skeets....you live in an appartment why do you need a weed wacker.
572613,GBW,2011-04-15 17:57:00,8460,  maybe to clear a better path to the river?
572616,Kawartha Kev,2011-04-15 18:00:00,281,Have you tried Alpine they are in Scarborough .
572630,skeeter,2011-04-15 18:17:00,1907,They dont carry stihl products.    But i have property in peterborough that needs maintenance.    That who i called and its $ 27.95 + tx just for the plastic tank.
572649,Kawartha Kev,2011-04-15 18:49:00,281,There's Oneida power in North York another Stihl dealer probably the same price.
572650,Roy,2011-04-15 18:53:00,13728,Pay the darn $30 and be done with it. Then give Miss Kelly a hug.
572673,Big Cliff,2011-04-15 19:59:00,6899,"Let me check tomorrow I might have a used one in good shape, $39.95 less the OFC discount which would be $39.95. I'll get back to you tomorrow."
572678,Rattletrap2,2011-04-15 20:14:00,1652,"$27.95 seems like a good deal to me. I mean the thing is a ""one of a kind"" item that is specific to that make and model. Supply and demand dictates that this would be a more expensive. JMHO"
572686,Rizzo,2011-04-15 20:36:00,4754,"tape the old one back together, seal up the edges with some gum, should hold most of the gas in."
573342,Big Cliff,2011-04-17 18:15:00,6899,"Sorry, I thought I might have one from a scrapped trimmer but it won't fit yours. If you can wait a couple of days, I'll check with a local shop that I use to work for, they might have one. Probably $5.00 if he does."
573532,skeeter,2011-04-18 12:20:00,1907,Thanks Cliff!!!!!  If they do have it i can pick it up on friday.
573559,fishhunter,2011-04-18 13:40:00,604,I'm a Stihl dealer and the price is $27.35 part number 4126 350 0400 I would not put a used one on unless its in great shape or you will be in the same boat in a year or two.
573560,Pikeslayer,2011-04-18 13:52:00,1443,"Hey Skeeter, Check with someone on Team 7  Slayer"
573791,Big Cliff,2011-04-18 21:17:00,6899," I wouldn't give him a used one unless it was in really good condition. Occasionally we get trimmers and things where someone forgot to put oil in the gas. (or they've tuned it up themselves   )  The motors aren't worth fixing and they don't want the unit back so we just use them for parts.  Where is your shop, I'll drop by next time I'm in the area.  Cliff"
574098,bigbuck,2011-04-19 14:08:00,2449," Lloyd, do you work at Gilmer's Home Hardware?? We've spent a lot of time there over the years picking up lumber, paint, stain, etc... over the years for our place in Osaca."
574143,Sinker,2011-04-19 17:01:00,8692,I get all my stihl parts from Gilmers Home hardware too.  We're almost neighbours bigbuck!  S.
574195,bigbuck,2011-04-19 18:57:00,2449,Where bouts are ya Sinker??
574203,Headhunter,2011-04-19 19:20:00,5703,"You keep eatin all that chili and you won't need a new tank, you will have on attached to you, all the time! HH"
