574447,lookinforwalleye,2011-04-20 11:42:00,4399,"If it is still under warranty then I would use the Mercury branded oil, if not then use what ever you want as long as it meets spec!"
574453,lew,2011-04-20 12:02:00,12766," I agree, I always use the manufacturers recommended oil on all my new vehicles, outboards, lawn equipment or whatever while it's under warranty, infact I often continue with it after warranty too.  Just my opinion though."
574491,Fisherman,2011-04-20 14:22:00,7201,"something for someone else to research, I was of the understanding that if the Mfgr requires you to use their product to honour warranty, then they have to provide it at no cost.  That's why they can't force the issue."
