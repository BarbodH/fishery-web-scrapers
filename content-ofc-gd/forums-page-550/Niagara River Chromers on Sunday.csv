573949,Aaron Shirley,2011-04-19 01:58:00,655,"I fished the lower Niagara in gale-force-plus winds on Sunday with a bud Joe. I filmed a great salmon show with Joe and the Barnes brothers last July, and it will be available to watch or download by tomorrow at surelyfishing.ca  I knew the weather wasn't looking good for us Sunday, but I didn't care. I HAD to get out, I was getting the shakes from fishing withdrawls lol. I didn't have a chance to fish in weeks, and when we got to the river to find heavily stained water, I wasn't impressed. I was hoping that the dams were spitting out muddy water, and the water would be cleaner up river. It was, and we had a good few hours of steelhead fishing   Although I only had the morning to fish, we did well with a dozen steelies in the boat, including some good fish. We tried several baits, but fresh bow roe was the ticket in dime-sized peach spawn net, with some on pink or orange.  The wind was so intense, I had my 80lb thrust trolling motor between 80 to 100 percent and still got blown off course badly. The harsh wind definitely wreeked havoc on good boat control, limiting opportunities. It's a good thing the fishing was so good to compensate   The winds blew spray off waves over 50-feet at times! The wind was so severe I actually thought about packing it in... but the fish were biting lol   The good thing was, we were fortunate to have dodged the rain and snow, until our drive back home. It was actually sunny for a good part of our fishing  Some photos from our day. We had to put our fish in the livewell and head to calm areas to take pics, as the wind was too crazy where we were fishing to take photos!                          Good fishing!  Aaron"

574051,ctranter,2011-04-19 12:01:00,543,"Aaron, your Niagara reports are always a treat.  Fishing like this is on my fishing bucket list for sure.  I can never get over the nice turquoise colour of that water.  If I didn't know better I'd say you were smashing steelhead in Cuba!  Thanks!"
