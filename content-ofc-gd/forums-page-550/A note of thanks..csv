I was having some issues getting my GPS up and running. I had an idea what the problem was, but didn't know where to find the part needed. I phoned up Jos after reading several of the members here praising his abilities. Well, all you folks were right. He's a good guy that knows his stuff. He mailed me the part I needed. I don't know if he comes on here or not, but..... Thank You!"

573637,fishnsled,2011-04-18 17:17:00,3520,Great to hear you got that sorted out. I personally haven't dealt with Jos but keep hearing great things about him. Word of mouth is sometimes the best advertising.

Met him Years ago when I was doing tournaments against him and he was also a supporter of the Kids fishing Derby that I used to do at our trailer park. Have been friends with him ever since."
