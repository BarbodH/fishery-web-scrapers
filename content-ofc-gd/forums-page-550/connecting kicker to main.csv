573387,walleyejack,2011-04-17 21:27:00,358,"Anyone have an experience with connecting the kicker to the main motor,I looked at the EZ steer thing,not sure about it,read some reviews,more than half were not happy,just wondering what else is out there that is reliable and good value."
573392,Terry,2011-04-17 21:56:00,14456,I have used these on a few and have never had any real problem\for the price it's pretty good     http://www.cabelas.c...%3Bcat104602680
573395,dave524,2011-04-17 22:04:00,4508,"Done both, if the kicker is on the transom along side the main motor, the one Terry showed works great. If it is on one of those brackets you can raise and lower, then the EZ Steer is the better route. Just my experience  Edit: I've only used the kind Terry showed attached to the steering connection of the main and a straight shot across to the kicker, they talk about connecting at the cavitation plate too, guess that would work if you had a bracket mounted kicker but would be a real pain to connect and disconnect."
573403,workwear,2011-04-17 22:25:00,592,i use the same one as terry showed on my boat......very easy to hook up and also to take off.....easy take off when kicker isnt required.....i paid 50.00 bucks for mine......
573404,HTHM,2011-04-17 22:28:00,4082,I have seen that done with quick-connect air fittings and copper pipe.
573409,misfish,2011-04-17 22:38:00,29133,"  It,s amazing, when you work with these types of components,that you can come up with a working object."
573411,irishfield,2011-04-17 22:39:00,26272,Two (female thread) rod ends from Princess Auto for $6 each and a length of threaded rod and one jam nut... and of course an attach bracket for each motor.
573417,vinnimon,2011-04-17 22:57:00,2593,  Some funnier than others but they will do the job .
573447,walleyejack,2011-04-18 00:13:00,358,"I was thinking it could be easily made,I like Waynes idea,pretty simple,the one Terry had is pretty simple,same idea, don t care for the EZ steer thing,I have a thing about drilling holes in cavitation plate. Thanks for all the input. I was just gonna put a pulley on one end and string some clothes line cable across,tie it together and Bobs your uncle."
573464,irishfield,2011-04-18 00:37:00,26272,My idea is exactly what Lund does Al. Threaded rod hidden nicely inside a piece of black plastic tubing. I'll get a picture tomorrow if I remember.
573472,walleyejack,2011-04-18 00:56:00,358, Thank you sir. Now I just have to make a deal on the motor.
573474,Vanselena,2011-04-18 01:06:00,269," At Princess Auto there is a hydraulic section. I took a threaded rod and had them put the rod inside the hydraulic tubing, then they pressed on the threaded pivoting ends."

574196,irishfield,2011-04-19 19:07:00,26272,Sorry Al.. it didn't happen and I'm now in the city. Be Tuesday or Wednesday before I'm back home..
574302,workwear,2011-04-19 23:27:00,592, thats what i installed on my boat......works great
574382,PERCHER,2011-04-20 02:27:00,787,Dont hook it to the cavitation plate.Hook it up at the steering shaft and to the front bracket on the kicker. I have one on my 90 Opti  and it works great. Dan
