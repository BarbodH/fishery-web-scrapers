572210,torco,2011-04-14 17:57:00,656,"Hi,  I am looking at paddling and fishing the saugeen river to kick off the start of bass season. I have never been up to the saugeen and based on my readings its sounds like an excellent route and is known to have good smallmouth fishing.  Has anyone here ever done it? Looking for any info on your experiences."
572236,johnnyb,2011-04-14 19:10:00,3413,Darryl Chronzey did a show that covered exactly that -- went with an outfit called Grindstone Outfitters.....I believe they put in at Walkerton and drifted for a few miles...lots of good smallie action.  That is the extent of my knowledge on the topic    Hope it helps

There are Outfitters in the area like Thorncrest Outfitters that will move you and your canoes or rent you canoes.  Dan"
