573489,kickingfrog,2011-04-18 02:20:00,8333,The phrase: Tough as nails; doesn't even begin to describe Mister Proenneke.
573490,solopaddler,2011-04-18 02:27:00,8605,  Nice find. I'm not a huge fan of Kevin Callan's but watching him virtually retrace my route makes me yearn for who I once was.  Man do I miss it.  A few shots at the end shows a bit of Wendell's craftsmanship. There's so much more though...  Thanks for posting this.
573505,atvaholic,2011-04-18 03:44:00,271, Solo....is there any place you haven't been?
573527,pikehunter,2011-04-18 11:46:00,1659,"My first time to see this too. I was and am still amazed  What he did was what I had often dreamed about when I was young. He did it at 51, I believe and spent 35 years out there! What a legacy.  Thank you for posting."
573544,walleyejack,2011-04-18 12:50:00,358,"First time I have watched this,pretty amazing what one can do.  I am curious tho,if he was living by himself,how did ""they""get the shots and clips,maybe he had a hat cam,with solar powered batteries.  good little movie tho."
573580,Governator,2011-04-18 15:29:00,879,"First time I've watched this, what a great movie thanks.  I wonder if Les Stroud got some inspiration from this?  It's very inspiring"
573710,umKthxbye,2011-04-18 19:11:00,247,"Ive suddenly have the urge to build a log cabin and try that whole thing out. I would have a chainsaw though. And he lived there alone for 30+ years. I think i would need some company personally.  I love videos like this, it also doubles as a ""how to"", i learned allot on wood an what wood can make."
573746,Tdel,2011-04-18 20:12:00,393,Great video Gerritt. It held my interest right to the end. Thank you for posting it. I enjoyed it tremendously.  Tom.
573872,BUSTER,2011-04-18 23:27:00,1336,"I watched it last night for the first time, I must say I thought about it all day today..man if I only had work ethic like that.  "
573906,workwear,2011-04-19 00:44:00,592,thanks bro. G!!!!!!...............GREAT VIDEO
573908,tibbs,2011-04-19 00:46:00,650,I saw that on PBS last year.  It's quite a compelling story.
573359,Gerritt,2011-04-17 19:19:00,6129,"It has been awhile since anyone has posted about Dick... SO I thought I would post this video for all the new folks to OFC..  I have probably watched this video over a hundred times... Dreaming, for a simpler life...  Anyways I hope you enjoy it.

573362,archie_james_c,2011-04-17 19:34:00,618,Dick Proenekke lived a life most of us will only ever dream about. That guy had some serious cajones
573368,Fang,2011-04-17 19:52:00,1330,Thanks I needed that
573370,discophish,2011-04-17 20:02:00,392,"Wow, I haven't seen this in along time.  I love this feature.  I will admit, this guy has inspired me in such a positive way, for sure.  I have dreamed of setting up a permanent post in the Rockies, but it's more of a pipe dream than anything else.  What matters to me is that I would like to think that I can handle it.  Thinking back to the fundamentals, the simplicity of how life should be lived.  Our roots have been planted strong to the ground for that reason, but we have lost the value of how great life can be.  We end up cutting ourselves free from our roots and float aimlessly away in in a direction that has no meaning.  Some people can't even handle a day out in the wilderness, let alone survive a night with the amenities and conveniences that some parks will offer, like electricity and bathrooms.  We can all learn from Dick.  I know I have from him and others like him.  Thanks for sharing this."
573375,Terry,2011-04-17 20:21:00,14456,just watched it  very nice
573376,solopaddler,2011-04-17 20:21:00,8605,"Amazing Gerritt, I've never seen it before. Can't get over the ingenuity in making the hinges then the door latch and lock out of wood."
573379,HTHM,2011-04-17 20:29:00,4082,Awe inspiring!
573382,bushart,2011-04-17 20:54:00,2628,I love that show---watch every time when PBS runs it

Plenty of footage with Dick.  Loved his film, and only have The Frozen North left to watch tonight.  Amazing his skills and final choice in his life."
573427,Bernie,2011-04-17 23:27:00,3190,First time I ever seen it Gerritt. Watched the whole thing. Quite the way of life. Thanks for posting.

573455,Twocoda,2011-04-18 00:25:00,4130,first time seeing it ...first time enjoying it ...  Cheers
573460,solopaddler,2011-04-18 00:31:00,8605,"In a similar vein when I was on one of my lengthy solo canoe trips I stumbled onto Wendell Beckwith's cabins on an island on Whitewater lake north of Armstrong.  I believe Wendell lived a similar life although was much more eccentric.  He apparantly picked this island after performing complex calculations that proved to him that this island was the center of the universe.  However the level of construction and ingenuity in the series of cabins he built was breathtaking. Actually surpassing imo what was in this video.  Most ingenious I thought was his ""snail"" cabin. Built right into a hillside and more or less underground it was like a hobbit house from lord of the rings.  Octagonal shaped and lined with wood, it had an earthen roof where he supposedly planted vegetables for an early spring crop from the warmth.  The main cabin had a hand carved figurehead over the door like something out of Hansel and Gretel..just truly amazing in every detail.  I have tons of pictures in my scrapbook of these buildings. One day I'll get a scanner and post them properly."
573470,Fisherman,2011-04-18 00:50:00,7201,"Thanks, that's one of the best videos I've seen in a long time.  There's not too many that could accomplish just building his cabin, let alone living in nature.  Just shows what man is capable of."
573481,bigugli,2011-04-18 01:36:00,6138,I have always found his story to be a deep source of inspiration. Truly a testament to the resourcefulness and adaptability of man. Nice to be reminded that life is a work in progress.
573487,HTHM,2011-04-18 02:05:00,4082,CHeck this video out Mike.
