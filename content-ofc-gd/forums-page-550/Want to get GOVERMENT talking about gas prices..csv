Care to guess how much tax payers are paying for that solar electricity?  another good one Dalton.  I am not saying anything about price justification I am just voicing my opinion on why the gov. will not do anything to reduce the price, gotta pay for all those services!"

573660,Old Man,2011-04-18 17:46:00,822," Well Oggie, you definitely are a product of the 20th Century. As a former westerner, I could go back and dig up all sorts of issues and grievances that westerners could hold against eastern Canadians. The funny thing is that a lot of those jobs that were lost in the Alberta oil patch due to the National Energy Policy were held by easterners that had come west looking for work after the down turn in eastern Canadian manufacturing. I really thought that our country had move past this petty regionalism, but obviously there are hold outs."

All I know is Trudeau had the balls to stop gas price increases and to do what was good for most of Canada. Not Alberta and not the U.S. but all of Canada. If this continues we will be looking at a second recession in Canada.  Can't see Harper ever freezing energy prices. Oh yeah,he's from where???  Dan O."

There is nothing ANY politician or even the Prime Minister can even do.  They can give some tempory relief in a tax break if need be, but it would be financed by deficit spending, leading to cuts somewhere else down the line.  Its a commodity, traded as a future, and until crude is removed from the futures market it will be driven by PROFIT.  Personally to me its a corporate expense, just like the HST being an input credit.   What ever I have earned in investment returns from the energy sector far and wide over shadows any cost increases in fuel and its derrivities  Who I do feel sorry for is the families that were already on the edge financially, and are now being forced to make sacrificies on food items to afford gas and all its evil twins, there in fact lies the true shame of this  I read an economic report a few months back thats prediciting that 60% of the US population will be making critical choices in lifestyle to afford gas....."

573448,Kingsalmon,2011-04-18 00:17:00,107," Yes its a commodity, and demand fluctuates due to the economy and weather, but its the supply and ultimately the price that is manipulated by a handful of nations.  If they WANT the price to go up, they just shorten the supply by turning off a well.  Oil should be at $50 a barrel.  But until such time that  OPEC and Oil companies  greed ceases to exist we will continue to pay whatever price they want to charge us no matter what."
573484,Old Man,2011-04-18 01:56:00,822," The supply situation is a little more complicated than just ""turning on and off wells"". The price of crude at $50/barrel would basically slow up or stop production in areas such as the tar sands due to the fact that extraction of oil from that source would become uneconomical. So supply would shrink as well, thus again driving up prices. A large portion of the crude used by both Canada and the US comes from this source (35% of US crude has Canadian origins) While OPEC quotas have influenced oil price in the past and still do to some extent, the main reason for soaring prices is the worldwide increase in demand for oil driven mainly by emerging economies in India and China. Political instability in some major oil producing regions also tends to drive the future prices for crude up. The cost of locating and extracting new sources of crude have also increased and again at $50/barrel, activity in this area would be curtailed. What this all comes down to is the fact that crude oil is becoming a scarcer commodity while demand is still increasing. As a commodity, it also lacks any economical or practical substitute at this time that can take it's place. As prices go higher, it will have the effect of driving the search for alternatives. The fact of life is that $30 or $50 or even $75 / barrel crude is a thing of the past and not likely to be seen again anytime soon or ever."
573488,mrpike,2011-04-18 02:17:00,151,I now under stand why we are in this mess. Because so meany people out there thing that GOVERMENT and OIL companys and others have the right to GOUCH the average man. AND it is spreading look at the price of food  cloths housing cars trucks insurance gas hydro water . ITS JUST ALL OUT OF CONTROL . THE cost of living is hurting more and more people every day businesses are closing every day . IN fiftyseven years of my life I have never seen pricies rise so much and so fast the average man just can't keep up. Even if you get a raise of 2% per year it is far short of the cost of living now days . I guess we all just have to grin and bear it until it is to late and most are living in poverty. Just look at them  over sea's now. WE are really going to leave our kids a great life in this country. MY kids can't afford a car now or afford to move out of the house at age twenty five and both are working full time . it sure is a different life now then in my days and its getting worst evry day . SORRY FOR THE RANT.
573491,danc,2011-04-18 02:28:00,4677," I hear ya mrpike, but I think that Canada is in great shape. We have everything in abundance that the rest of the world wants. We have minerals (gold, diamonds, chromium ((big time)), palladium, etc., etc.), oil, wood, and water. Times are changing for sure but I think that we are sitting well here."
573493,Old Man,2011-04-18 02:39:00,822," I agree. Demand for commodities will increase at a accelerated pace in the years to come, and Canada's position in this area is strong. It's funny, being a nation of farmer, miners, and lumberjacks was considered to be a weakness in the 20th century but it will be our strength is this century."
573498,Oggie,2011-04-18 03:00:00,588,"Funny I'mm old enough to remember Mr. Trudeau. The last time the country faced this situation, he nationalized the energy sector and froze the price of gasoline.  Guess Free Trade wouldn't allow us to do that now. We sell our oil to the Americans and they have lower gasoline prices than us.  We are blessed with great natural resources but I think we screwed ourselves when we signed NAFTA. The Americans only sign deals when they win.  Our natural resources will be traded and sold as THEY see fit.  Any leader that wanted to get elected would just need to guarantee a moratorium on gas price increases for a year. Majority Governmnent!  Dan O."
573503,Old Man,2011-04-18 03:35:00,822, The difference in the US and Canadian gas prices is mainly due to tax. Mr. Trudeau's national energy policy was also responsible for massive lay offs in the Alberta oil fields and the ceasation of oil and gas exploration and development in Canada.
573509,Old Man,2011-04-18 04:16:00,822,Canadian average for gasoline tax is 31.9 cents/litre (equivalent to $1.21 per US gal).  US average for gasoline tax 48.1 cents/ US gal (equivalent to 12.7 cents per litre)

573536,cynmar,2011-04-18 12:36:00,169,"Gentlmen, there is another side to the supply and demand equation that no one has mentioned. We are the ones driving that demand, we drive our car, we use our boat motors, we drive our RV. Cut down the demand and the price goes down. However, this involves a societal change in thinking that isn't going to happen soon. I won't get into the alternative energy side of the argument as it appears that with the price of oil so high , alternatives like solar, wind, geothermal etc. are becoming more attractive. I believe that as the world's supply of oil goes down, the producers have seen the writing on the wall and are determined to some extent to drive the price higher. Libya's share of world production was what, 2% , and you are saying this justifies a price increase. No, there is a certain amount of price fixing there but the oil as a commodity argument is valid. As far as governments being able to do something, unlikely , as the price goes up so does the amount of tax they collect. Who here has seen a politician give back tax dollars. Hell, the GST was supposed to be a temporary measure.  Bill"
