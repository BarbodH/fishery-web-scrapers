572131,Grimace,2011-04-14 13:34:00,2020,It's a good place to work.  Just back after a couple of years roaming.
572155,craigdritchie,2011-04-14 15:16:00,1586,"My actual office isn't all that impressive - think stuffy closet with a desk and a phone and you pretty much have the idea. Good thing I don't spend very much time in it.    I work in magazine publishing, so the majority of the real work I do happens somewhere else. For example, I attend 15 to 20 different boat shows each year, all over the world. This one is in Germany. Sounds great, but for me, it's another day at work.    My job is a mix of business development, schmoozing, and I still do some writing. I enjoy writing about boats, and one part of my job is test-driving and writing about new models as they come out. This is a new Skeeter, still parked in the slip at Yamaha's secret testing facility in rural Alabama. Even outside on a rainy day, it has that new car smell. I would love it if this was my full time office. Maybe one day.    Speaking of new car smell, I also sometimes write about automotive stuff. Last year I got visit Hankook Tire Company's R&D centre in Korea. They let us spend an hour or so trying out high performance tires on their test track. That was a pretty fun day at the office. Unfortunately, they didn't let me keep the car.    My primary ""other"" office these days is an airplane seat. It's best to write things while the experience is still fresh in your mind, and before you head off someplace else and forget all the details. This picture was taken while flying through a typhoon on a trans-Pacific flight. Note the 702 mph ground speed, while flying into a 149 mph head wind! Almost supersonic in a 777!     Like any other job, it has its ups and downs. But I wouldn't trade it for anything. I'm a pretty lucky guy."

Then you can arrange that every dope dealer gets a picture of their smashed escalade when they are in the can.  Now that would be a great day at work."
