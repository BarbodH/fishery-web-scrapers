573972,ctranter,2011-04-19 02:25:00,543,"Decided to hit a river that I rarely fish anymore and it paid off big time.  I was almost certain that I would lose this fish twice under a nasty log jam but both times I managed to pull her out.  Likely a PB, with less than a week to go before a major trip on the opener.  Decided to really blur the shot since it's a pool that many people often overlook.  I know I promised a fly report, so hopefully it will come next week!       Cheers, Chris"
