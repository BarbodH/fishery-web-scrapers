573630,Meely,2011-04-18 17:07:00,282,"Hello Kids,  Does anyone have any leads or contacts in regards to cheap Bon Fire wood in the Peterborough area. I really dont wanna buy a bush chord of fireplace wood only to burn it in the fire pit. If I was burning it for heat, I wouldnt mind but I dont feel right literally burning money in a fire pit.  Any info is appreciated,  Meely"
573649,DRIFTER_016,2011-04-18 17:35:00,10439,Go around the industrial areas and ask for old skids. They make great bonfire wood.
573665,crappieperchhunter,2011-04-18 17:54:00,2582,  Good advice if you are up to a little work/or have access to skids Meely. Thats what I have been doing here at work. We actually save all our broken skids/scrap wood at work in bins to go out as waste. I just go around when the bins are full...about once every 3 months...and cart the wood home to cut up. Then I throw a weekends worth in boxes when we head for the cottage. It cost me about 4 hours of my time for all my campfire wood last summer.  Be real careful when cutting though...skids have lotsa nails in them
573666,kuhaman,2011-04-18 17:54:00,503,"Try to find someone who sells slab wood, its way cheaper than firewood and it burns great. We get a dump truck full every fall and it costs about 300 bucks."
573671,misfish,2011-04-18 17:58:00,29133,"  Yep,start with a 20 skid high stack,give it some fuel and let it burn."
573673,Terry,2011-04-18 18:04:00,14456,every time there is high winds just look at the side of the road..  most places there is lots of wood for the grabbing
573674,johnnyb,2011-04-18 18:09:00,3413,"In the industrial areas around here, I see some places actually put their scrap wood from packaging crates/damaged skids in containers beside the road with a sign saying it's free for the taking."
573714,NAW,2011-04-18 19:14:00,4022,"My nahbour is a horder.  He has a wood pile a mile high, and doesn't mind that I chip away at it.  I guess I lucked out in that department.  Before he offered though, I used to grab free skids all the time."
573716,Harrison,2011-04-18 19:20:00,2202,"Contact a tree cutting biz in your area, sometimes they don't mind alittle help cleaning up."
573729,Beans,2011-04-18 19:32:00,3339, I thought you and the Buckster guy were going to come over to my place and play Paul Bunyan...?  There is a whole Spruce tree out front that has to come down (minus the top one third that the lightning did a number on and killed the tree...  I also got a few 6 foot cedar logs out back that you can have...I need help getting them in my truck (or yours)...  Lemme know...   
573737,bigugli,2011-04-18 19:51:00,6138,"You cannot bring wood from the GTA outside the quarantine zone folks. A lot of that crate and skid wood from Asia is untreated, and could spread more problems around your favourite getaway. My neice spent 6 months in Toronto doing inspections for Asian longhorn beetle. Amazing how many live specimens she would find in a week."
573742,kuhaman,2011-04-18 19:57:00,503,"I guess the phrase buy local really applies to that. Never seen a longhorn beetle, and never want to. Kuha"
573745,Beans,2011-04-18 20:09:00,3339, 1 load eqals about 3 bush cords...a lot of work to cut to stove size...you get a lot of skinny pieces that can be cut-up for kindling...
573749,kuhaman,2011-04-18 20:17:00,503,"Yeah it takes some work to split up some of the bigger pieces and stacking takes alot of time too, but its still pretty cheap and I like cheap. Doing all that work makes the beers taste that much better too"
573760,bigugli,2011-04-18 20:35:00,6138, Ratkovsky's?
573776,Twocoda,2011-04-18 20:51:00,4130,roughly two cord of cedar already cut into stove length...lol...it really kills me to say that ...but thats what my son did with a few huge trees off his property...free if you want but ya have to take the stumps too...(they are already out of ground)
573782,Burtess,2011-04-18 21:09:00,901,Don't forget to pick up any wicker chairs if you see them on the side of the road too  Burt
573918,Meely,2011-04-19 01:10:00,282,"Thanks kids,  I was hoping to find someone local who would spare me some.....I dont  mind payin a few bucks!!  Bean-o .....I'll gladly take that wood from ya.
