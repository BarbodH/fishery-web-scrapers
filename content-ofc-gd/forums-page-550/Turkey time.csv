573835,Fang,2011-04-18 22:20:00,1330,Sitting down to dinner and look out across the road to see a wild turkey hen on the grass. I'm in dowtown Oakville though just a few blocks from the lake. They're everywhere!  UPDATE after dinner  Still walking around the neighbourhood like it hasn't a care in the world. I know my beagle is about ready to go through the front window.    
573845,misfish,2011-04-18 22:41:00,29133,"Saddly Paul,the turkeys took a big hit on the property I hunt from the yotes. I do have a large tom and 2 jakes and 7 hens,thats all I have seen and been reported. Far cry from the 3-5 herums I had 4-5 years ago. There has been more deer sightings then turkey. Go figure.  I have the 26th booked off.Will see what the opener brings."
573850,richyb,2011-04-18 22:51:00,774,  Doesnt it open on the 25th?
573861,misfish,2011-04-18 23:09:00,29133,"You would be correct Rich.I was looking at the wrong year.  Working so much,I dont even know what day it is half the time. Thanks for the correction.  http://ca.wrs.yahoo.com/_ylt=A0oG75wtxKxNJhEASavrFAx.;_ylu=X3oDMTBybnZlZnRlBHNlYwNzcgRwb3MDMQRjb2xvA2FjMgR2dGlkAw--/SIG=13ckeajh8/EXP=1303254445/**http%3a//www.mnr.gov.on.ca/stdprodconsume/groups/lr/@mnr/@fw/documents/document/239847.pdf"
573862,irishfield,2011-04-18 23:10:00,26272,"So with that.. the answer would be YES, the 25th !"
573871,misfish,2011-04-18 23:25:00,29133,"Look at the spurs on her.Would put a tom to shame.  No scence heading your way Wayne,as they only come out when Leah yells out""ok boys,thier gone,come on out now""."
573884,richyb,2011-04-18 23:50:00,774,they will only be stupid for another week. Good luck to who ever is going out.
