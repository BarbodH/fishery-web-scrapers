573997,dhickey,2011-04-19 03:18:00,1038,it works realy well on all deep root weeds /thistulle/burdock/  exct.  good luck.  key is dry and thirsty.
574090,bigugli,2011-04-19 13:48:00,6138,"For all you fellas using Roundup, please do not apply anywhere near streams, ponds, shoreline.  The chemical is notorious for its adverse effects on amphibians and aquatic life. Put simple, it can hurt the fishing."
574232,ehg,2011-04-19 20:33:00,2666,Just thought i would add a story...  Once when fishing a buddy had to crap bad so found a wooded spot and he did his biz... He said luckily he found these big soft leaves to wipe.  Turned out to be poison ivy leaves...
574269,Rod Caster,2011-04-19 22:27:00,5784,"Why not just dress properly, cut the stems, dig up the roots, dispose, backfill and then wash you clothes? Sounds like the weedkiller kills more than just weeds ..unless of course your talking about a large area."
574322,Sinker,2011-04-20 00:20:00,8692,"If its a large area, good luck!  Its easy to control, but getting rid of it is nearly impossible. Trust me, I've been dealing with it for years. In this neck of the woods, its EVERYWHERE!!  S."
574395,cram,2011-04-20 03:11:00,1733, My nightmare.  Poison ivy is my achilles heel.  Terribly allergic to the stuff.
573717,kuhaman,2011-04-18 19:21:00,503,Any good ways to get rid of this stuff(other than gasoline and a match) I get a rash just thinking about it and this year I want to get rid of it early before its in full attack mode. Any help would would be greatly appreciated Thanks Kuha
573723,kickingfrog,2011-04-18 19:29:00,8333,Burning it is a bad idea.
573724,irishfield,2011-04-18 19:30:00,26272,Don't EVER burn poison ivy. You think itchy arms suck... try breathing in some PIvy smoke !
573726,Fisherman,2011-04-18 19:31:00,7201,"The last thing you want to do is burn it, the oil becomes airborne and can cause severe respiratory problems to anyone breathing it in, even from a distance.  Round-up herbicide s one of the best.  It may take several treatments, but it works."
573727,kuhaman,2011-04-18 19:31:00,503,"Just kidding about the burning, I could only imagine how it would feel getting into your lungs. Scary"
573730,Garry2Rs,2011-04-18 19:32:00,1425,I suspect that Round-up is the way to go.
573732,kuhaman,2011-04-18 19:36:00,503,Can we still buy that stuff? I was hoping for a more eco friendly way.
573733,Gerritt,2011-04-18 19:38:00,6129,"gloves, fully clothed and pull em... then salt the earth."
573735,bigugli,2011-04-18 19:44:00,6138,"Roundup was supposed to have been banned for public and commercial use by now. An organic alternative. Pick a hot sunny day and spray the patches with vinegar. Burns the plants, and other unwanted weeds to a crisp ( does not work too well in the shade). Unfortunately it does not work on the root network. Most retail weed killers also fail in that regards."
573743,chessy,2011-04-18 20:03:00,610,"round up will kill all vegetation . if you can buy weed killer and spray at the point of runoff (the leaves) it will kill poision ivy. i dont know about the enviriomntal stuff.. what you need is   a combination of  2-4d ,dicamba, and mecoprop this is the true weed killer .. it is avalble if you know the right person and you dont want to kill every thing"
573748,dave524,2011-04-18 20:15:00,4508," Add 245-T , Gramoxone and Paraquat to he list, essentially Agent Orange  The right person may be in the military.   We used Gramoxone on the farm back in the 60's, it killed everything very dead, now they say we could have serious health issues because of it , no MSD sheets back then"
573754,kuhaman,2011-04-18 20:21:00,503,"Man, I gotta take a chemistry course LOL"
573755,dave524,2011-04-18 20:24:00,4508," No, just stay very far away from those names, please."
573767,bigugli,2011-04-18 20:41:00,6138,Gramoxone is still an approved commercial herbicide in agricultural use.  I never reccommend any product to the public that requires certification. It still is only a contact herbicide. For systematic eradication you need heavier herbicides. None of those are available to the general public.
573768,jedimaster,2011-04-18 20:42:00,3472,I thought this was going to be about the movie...
573798,kuhaman,2011-04-18 21:26:00,503,Alyssa Milano should of won an oscar  :worthy:  :worthy:  :worthy:Drew Barrymore was pretty good too.
573822,archer379,2011-04-18 22:03:00,277,weed control companys are still alowed to spray for poison ivy
573836,dave524,2011-04-18 22:20:00,4508," Sorry Bruce, I'm a little sensitive on the issue spent 5 years as a teen farm handing on a mixed fruit farm in Niagara. When they banned Killex and Roundup I did some searching as I knew I had used a lot of similar chemicals, namely Gramoxone and 245T , the Material Safety Data Sheets and reports of long term medical conditions due to exposure was a real eye opener when all we had for protection was cutoffs and a T shirt  Oh, we also grew a field of corn and a field of potatoes, you can add atrazine to  my list of my exposure for the corn and we always dusted the seed poatoes with captan too. The Railway and Hydro workers I believe has law suits going for compensation for their exposure , they used to spray along railway lines and hydro cuts. I do have respiratory problems but only my say so on exposure and a long gone farmer.  Hint : if you go the contact herbicide route, mix a little diesel fuel with it. It will stay on the shiny waxy poison ivy leaves longer and work better as they are contact herbicides."
573873,Sharkbait22,2011-04-18 23:27:00,297,"Concentrated Round-up is no longer available but the diluted form is. Home hardware has it.  The label has a big ivy on it.  I'm very allergic to poison ivy and the drugs to control it mainly prednisone is likely worse them what Round-up does.  It will take two years to likely fully get rid of it and then applications every so often thereafter. There is a lot of good advice on the net e.g., Ohio State Extension Office. Good luck."
573904,cram,2011-04-19 00:38:00,1733,"how big is the patch?  Organic - boiling water or vinegar.  Could also just dump some limestone on it.  Or, talk to a farmer about getting some agricultural herbicide."
573935,FishAbout,2011-04-19 01:38:00,106,"I worked for the weedman for 3 years and sprayed poison ivy all the time around Owen Sound.  If it is a big patch you may have to spray it a few times over the year to kill it all. They have a vine like root system and just shoot up.  Round up works the best, poison ivy will just laugh at you with the orgainc stuff.  Wear some rubber boots and long rubber gloves and wash everything after you are done.  Spray as early in the season as you can.  I have sprayed patches that were 2 feet high, had to spray it 2 years in a row to kill it all."
573964,bigugli,2011-04-19 02:14:00,6138,"They might be using Glyphos. A decent systemic herbicide with ""less"" harm to aquatic life."
573966,Sinker,2011-04-19 02:21:00,8692,"you can kill poison ivy, but you can never get rid of it!! We spray it with round up, then cover the area with mulch. Seems to keep it away from areas we have kids for a while.  S."
573968,dhickey,2011-04-19 02:23:00,1038,i had good luck with round up. the key is to watch the weather you want to spray it when there is no rain in the forcast for at least 3-4 days. also it realy helps if the soil is dry(thirsty) mix round up with water(2 cups round up to 10 litres water) dont spray just pour it out of a container.  (i use a 10 litre water jug that you can buy at any food store for mixing) saturate the soil first. let the leavas dry off then spray the leaves with the mixture that you bought(soak them)  the key is to hit it when its dry(late june/july ) this should kill the root system. in august dig out 3 inches of top soil. soak the root area with round up and cover with new top soil then soak it with water and seed it with grass. next spring you will see nothing but grass.  it sounds like alot of work but its worth it.  hope this helps.
573983,mercman,2011-04-19 02:50:00,7054,"Great idea Dawg ! I""m going to try it on a small patch i have starting in the far back of my property later this summer. Thanks  Paul"
