682187,PickerelHunter,2012-03-31 04:11:00,100,"A recent spur of the moment purchase saw me get an Endura C2 30lb thrust trolling motor on sale for $99.  The goal is to get it onto the Coleman canoe (similar to this http://northtreasure.com/canoe%20copy.jpg ) that we have and bring it into some back lakes.  I've built the mounting bracket and the next step is now the battery.  I have searched the web for info and the only conclusion I've come to is it needs to be a deep cycle battery.  Went to Costco today, and there's different grouping, amp hours, crank somethings etc.  Frustrated I left to research some more.  Hoping you guys can help me out in determining the right specs for a battery, I'm really uneducated on this topic."

They come in various ""sizes"" which are then based upon run min at a specified trolling motor thrust. They also have others which are for both starting and deep cycle. Then make sure you get a good charger."
682191,PickerelHunter,2012-03-31 04:58:00,100,"Thanks for you input  Any suggestions as to what size, and amp hours etc is best for a 30lb thrust?  I found this nice article here http://tufox.com/hobie/TrollingPerformance.html and helped me a bit, but the terminology is all new to me."
682194,Sinker,2012-03-31 06:03:00,8692,"Get the biggest one you can afford/carry. You won't regret it.  That TM will run all day on a 27 series battery.  Get a proper deep cycle battery charger, and your all set!  S."

Not sure if the sales still on but here's the info:  Minn Kota Endura C2-50 lbs Min Kota (5amp) logic Charger $50.00 mail in rebate  $189.00  Without a dout, the best deal I had come across and I had been looking since last fall."
683201,RickOnt,2012-04-03 12:07:00,669,PH  Get a Deep Cycle for sure.   For the canoe and packing it in to the back lakes the weight willbe a concern So the Group 24 would be the lightest but the Group 27 would last more hours.   Rick
