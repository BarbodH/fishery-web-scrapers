They were hitting the biggest minnows we had most aggressively.  Even managed to `drill`a couple of holes in a passing ice sheet with our paddle.  15-18`FOW was where they were at today....jig and minnow the weapon of choice.

682480,limeyangler,2012-04-01 12:16:00,5204," I did say something to him, he still wanted to wear them  At least he was wearing his life jacket all day. I was wearing mine all day too, dont usually but water temp was just below 4C (39F) and it would not take long to succumb to those temps if you went in."
