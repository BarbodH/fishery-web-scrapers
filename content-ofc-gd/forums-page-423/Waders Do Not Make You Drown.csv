682733,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2012-04-01 21:49:00,0, thanks for the added safety tips woodenboater.
682735,Rod Caster,2012-04-01 21:50:00,5784,"Good to know that they aren't an automatic death sentence... I somewhat thought this too and really scared myself a few times, not falling in, but feeling like I was losing control in a fast river. I thought for sure I'd be a gonner... And a lot of people told me its SUPER dangerous. Agreed with those that said first hand experience (contolled environment) would be the best way to avoid panic in a real life situation."
682744,ketchenany,2012-04-01 22:24:00,3229," I saw my good bud Dave Fernie 'step' into a deep hole on the Bighead in November! All I heard was ""save my rod"" as they filled up, he got out and after a good fire we dried him out. A nude dude in November is classic. John Kerr was not there, if he was he'd probably would have said, let the dummy go!"
682760,fishing,2012-04-01 23:06:00,167,"Also undertows are deadly. People die no matter what, and even life jackets are no help. Saw it happen just 20 feet in front of me for two cases."
682763,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2012-04-01 23:15:00,0," undertow, hydraulics, lowhead dams etc. are definite killers waders or not."
682769,limeyangler,2012-04-01 23:32:00,5204," Thanks for posting doc.....interesting thread.  To answer your question Jigger, Cliff was using them as rainwear."
682771,NAW,2012-04-01 23:34:00,4022," Waders keep you 100% dry.  I don't have a really good pair of rain gear.  So if it's raining hard, I've often thrown on my waders to keep dry.  Specially during may 24 camping, when it's cold..  I've gone under wearing my waders while duck hunting more than once.  No problem..  They didn't cause me to sink any faster."
682781,workwear,2012-04-02 00:02:00,592,when i used to fish rivers...i had a friend literally sink in this sand/mud combo up to his waist ..now that was a scary thing....what would one do if alone in that situation..  it was a helluva time getting him out.....
682786,woodenboater,2012-04-02 00:25:00,2277,"No experience with waders and air but I do with drysuits.  If one forgets to 'burp' their drysuit, then much of the air in the suit could end up trapped below your pfd. Not a good thing as it means the air will bring your feet and legs up, exactly what you don't want to happen.  Before I get in my canoe, I wade into waist deep water, crouch down and pull back my neck seal a bit to let the air escape. Kinda makes for a cling wrap but it expels most of the air. Pretty well all my paddling friends do likewise.  So I'm guessing air in waders and a very tight belt *could* do similar but that's just a guess.  and yeah Doc, most fisherman aren't going to go over a pourover/drop, I was kinda on a roll typing things up and couldn't stop"
682792,Dozer,2012-04-02 00:53:00,896," Wow, thats an eye opener for sure, scary scene."
682803,John Bacon,2012-04-02 01:43:00,3277,  I was told to lie as straight as possible and float feet first down stream.  That way if you hit a rock you will hit it with you feet instead of your head. Keeping your body straight reduces the chances of catching your tail bone on a rock.
682811,kemper,2012-04-02 02:14:00,2232," I took a swim in the Bighead this past December, stepped on a rock that looked ""wet"" but with the sub zero temps it was ice. My wading belt and waterproof jacket with cuffs and waste band zipped tight kept me almost perfectly dry except for a real wet hat."
682813,woodenboater,2012-04-02 02:18:00,2277,"Tbh, I've never really heard the knee chest thing applied to whitewater paddling except for going over drops. A lot depends on the speed of current and depth of water. If it's only a foot or two, I have no probs/issues standing up and have done so on trips. I also paddle with people whom I trust with my life and they trust me with theirs. Anything waist high and over, yes, you're getting into troublesome territory with foot entrapments.  Trees, trunks and limbs and such are another matter and are more of a worry to me than foot entrapments. Getting caught in a sieve/strainer can and has killed, so avoidance is the primary goal if one encounters a tree fallen across a fast moving river.  Of course, the above may not neccesarily apply to wading on a trout stream or river but understanding river morphology is important for safety and for understanding where your finned prey like to hang out.  Sorry I've strayed OT from waders and safety"
682815,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2012-04-02 02:30:00,0,i'd say anything to do with self rescue in the water is more than relevant wb.
682616,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2012-04-01 17:51:00,0,"I wanted to dispel a myth of waders, and that is if you fall in the water wearing them they will drown you since it came up in Simon's thread...  For years I too believed this myth until my employer at the time forced us to go through training on the subject.  As part of training for field staff we were forced to jump into a swimming pool with waders on.  You see, it's just basic physics.  The water INSIDE your waders weighs the same as the water OUTSIDE your waders and thus does not make you sink.  It's not good to believe things like this because it leads to unnecessary panic when you hit the water... I am a very poor swimmer and was able to jump in the water, swim around, then remove my waders while still in the water.  I have zero body fat and sink like a rock on a good day.  I just wanted to post this FYI because I think it's important that people not fear something that isn't true, especially in a situation where PANIC is so likely to kill you."
682618,davey buoy,2012-04-01 18:01:00,5505,Good to know!
682619,mercman,2012-04-01 18:01:00,7054,"Yup, they will not make you sink, maybe a little harder to get back in the boat with the extra weight of water though."
682620,richyb,2012-04-01 18:02:00,774,They can even serve as a flotation divice if there is some air caught up in them. In school they made us jump in the pool wearing chest waders. MYTH BUSTED lol
682621,Dave Bailey,2012-04-01 18:02:00,1641," Sadly, our schools aren't doing a great job of teaching subjects like that."
682625,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2012-04-01 18:08:00,0, it is harder to get back in the boat  and it would be advised to keep the buckles outside of your clothing so they can be easily removed in the water.
682631,mercman,2012-04-01 18:27:00,7054,  Excellent advice! We become so accustomed to things that sometimes we forget to put safety first. Always have an escape route or procedure in the back of your mind for those worst case scenarios.
682633,Terry,2012-04-01 18:30:00,14456,"Wonder if the pool you jumped in had a current to pull you down stream or an undertow to flow into your waders to drag you down...  You see, it's just basic physics.  your waders in clam water is not a problem  but in a fast flowing river  they became a driftsock, a parachute and same for taking them off while still in the water..try it in a current.....   of course if you have the openings completely closed it would not be an issue   just saying, life doesn't always work out as school teaches us"
682638,bushart,2012-04-01 18:42:00,2628,While we're talkin safety  My buddy is a whitewater canoer  Always told me--if you fall in fast water--tuck your knees under your chest---if your foot gets caught in a limb or a rock---you can't fight current to stay upright
682639,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2012-04-01 18:43:00,0," i appreciate the ""physics"" of what you are saying but we also busted this myth.  the only time the waders will fill with water and act as a ""drift sock"" is if the person panics and tries to swim against the current. again, panic is the common denominator that kills, not the waders themselves.  if you slip in heavy current you are supposed to lay back with your feet facing downstream with your toes up.  the flow WILL push you downstream but the waders will not cause you to go any faster downstream or sink."
682645,kickingfrog,2012-04-01 18:50:00,8333,"I had a chance to do these tests in school as well. It's one thing to be told something, much better to try it first hand.  Wet re-entries into canoes and small aluminum boats were also very useful.   As a kid I wasn't aloud to wear rubber boats in the boat ""because the boots would sink me to the bottom."""
682647,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2012-04-01 18:51:00,0,"i should add i took a scary plunge on a night shift one year during spring flows.  had i not known to not panic and to get into the ""defensive swimming position"" i'm not sure i would be here today as the water was cold and it was too dark to be able to tell the depth.  thankfully i rode the current for about one hundred meters until i hit an eddy and was able to swim to the shore.  my waders did not fill up despite the fact that they were a size 44 waist.  i was embarrassed to be soaking wet but nobody saw. hahaha"
682648,BillM,2012-04-01 18:52:00,17367,"Anytime I've been over the top the waders have stuck to my body like glue.  Other then a few cups of water inside, there was nothing.  Now if they fill up, you've got all that extra weight to lift out as well..   That would make it real hard to get into a boat/canoe/whatever."
682652,Terry,2012-04-01 18:57:00,14456,"so as long as you don't panic(I am sure most people wouldn't panic) as long as there is no undertow as long as there are no big rocks to beat you up or know you out, tree to get stuck under or a major waterfalls to fall over ( note to self, don't fish on the high side of Niagara falls) your good to go and enjoy the trip down the river  LO got it"
682662,solopaddler,2012-04-01 19:16:00,8605,"  Agreed, and I say this from experience. A deep fast flowing river is a far cry from a swimming pool.  Also it depends a lot on the type of waders. Neoprenes wouldn't hinder you at all. They're more form fitting and are in fact bouyant.   Loose, billowing nylon, breathable or even worse rubber waders, especially without a wading belt cinched up tight are a major hindrance if you fall into deep fast water.  Again this comes from personal experience."
682663,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2012-04-01 19:21:00,0,did it come from personal experience?  good advice to make use of those wader belts but make sure they are quick release like the shoulder straps.
682676,solopaddler,2012-04-01 20:01:00,8605,"  It did, thanks for asking."
682680,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2012-04-01 20:12:00,0,just making sure big guy! i wasn't sure!
682687,solopaddler,2012-04-01 20:32:00,8605,  It's always good to make sure of something before posting it as fact.
682710,paul_614,2012-04-01 21:14:00,168,"my old school rubber ones didn't help me float, the tight waist belt did help keep the water out"
682723,Jigger,2012-04-01 21:31:00,1237,"Just as a side note, why wear waders if youre in a boat?"
682724,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2012-04-01 21:34:00,0," not sure what you're insinuating other than your typical ""know it all"" crap. i've spent the last decade working in waders and won't contribute to the panic that leads to drowning.  i bet had i said that waders kill people you would have disagreed with that too."
682727,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2012-04-01 21:36:00,0, i wore them for work a lot to access remote survey sites by boat and i wear them to boat to different holes on rivers.
682731,woodenboater,2012-04-01 21:48:00,2277,"  and if one finds oneself about to go over a small drop, let's say anything over 7 feet, tuck when you go over for the same reason as above.  When I was learning oc boating, we called it the holy s^#t position feet up pointing downstream so you can use your feet to push off any rocks that decide to impede your progress.  And if you find yourself in swift water, angle feet AWAY from the shore you want to aim for and make haste. If the water is squirrely, barrel roll your way past tough eddy lines/fences.  And if one finds oneself heading downstream through wave troughs, time your breaths at the peak and breathe through clenched teeth so you minimize water intrusion.  lastly, I know it's not something waders will bring with them but I consider a waist worn throw bag as good safety equipment. Salamander makes a very slim one that I love for whitewater. Used properly, could make an event unpleasant vs scary."
682732,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2012-04-01 21:48:00,0,"as a footnote, the notion that your boots fill with air and flip you upside and drown you is also a myth."
