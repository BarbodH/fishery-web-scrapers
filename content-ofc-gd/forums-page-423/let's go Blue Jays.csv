682767,muskymatt,2012-04-01 23:32:00,2608,":clapping: Actually, it's a anti-leafs thread, disguised as a baseball thread. Therefor a hockey thread, but the lafs can't play hockey, so I don't know what the heck it is   :dunno:  But the Sens made the playoffs, so maybe it's a Sens thread, disguised as a lafs suck thread...I'm confused....

There comes a time when you have to realize---the glory days of the eppinger daredevle--are not comin back---and if you insist on continuing to stay with it  You can watch everyone else catch fish"

682843,solopaddler,2012-04-02 09:20:00,8605," So, you're a big fan of the Toronto Blue Jays? How does being a charter member of Jays Nation sit with you?  Would you still cheer for the Jays if Ottawa got their own team?   How ironic.   Regarding hockey your team is in dire straits without Alfie and that grinning huckleberry who plays center for them."
682863,Billy Bob,2012-04-02 12:05:00,5865, IF they all buy tickets they can go to the World Series.....

682878,bushart,2012-04-02 12:57:00,2628,Sinky---when reality calls--make sure ya pick up  You base the fan numbers on the leaf games in ottawa you watch??--where the only lot in life they have is to buy up tickets and make noise in a classless way--sure hab fans will verify  Be sure to watch the playoff games in Ottawa and you'll see a full arena ---with Sens fans---Now I realize playoff hockey is something you may not be used to---but believe me or google it  They do play nhl hockey after the middle of april
682938,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2012-04-02 16:08:00,0, they seemed to do alright yesterday.

682957,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2012-04-02 17:29:00,0,"speaking of buffalo ghetto, when i went to a sens/sabres game in buffalo our tour bus had to park under an overpass with hobos having a fire in an oil drum to keep warm!   That reminds me of a few of Buffalo's slogans to attract tourism...   ""BUFFALO!   Not quite the    of America but you can see it from there!""   and   ""Buffalo, where good times go to die!"""

682622,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2012-04-01 18:02:00,0,i think it would be great for hamilton's chances at an nhl squad. i can't imagine how bitter and jaded the leafs fans will be when both the sens and the habs have won a cup since 67.
682670,fishfarmer2,2012-04-01 19:41:00,76,Go Jays go for 2012 the World Series]
682672,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2012-04-01 19:55:00,0,"in other nhl news (i know leaf fans and the toronto media don't like to admit there's 29 other teams), how about the ending of the pittsburgh/philly game!  that was awesome and that could be an EPIC first round series.  can't wait for the playoffs."
682728,muskymatt,2012-04-01 21:43:00,2608,"Absolutely, Pens Philly will be epic. Now the Sens are in the playoffs with a solid win! GO SENS GO!!!!!! Playing awesome without their #1 center and Alfie(PRAISE ALFIE) it'll be a good first round series!"

682738,bushart,2012-04-01 22:02:00,2628,OK Matt Jinx is off we're in!!..1..2..3.. Go!!  I'll get ya started  I watched the Molson's commercial about playoff traditions like growin beards---if ya watch it at the end---the team symbol runs through all teams and stops at The Leafs  Moral is---Drink enough and you can believe your in the playoffs  Reading all the smears over time by Leaf fans---they can have some back--cause you can fairly say that the Sens had difficulty beating the Leafs and habs this Year---but it does'nt matter---cause according to the points (the things they count)---they were not good enough to make the playoffs.  So when the Sens win the cup this year---I'll be the guy standing on Bank St In Ottawa with the Leafs Suck jersey while the parade is on.  Ok Matty---she's all yours--take no prisoners and we'll see ya at the parade  if not------we'll just go fishin
682741,[email protected],2012-04-01 22:17:00,119," funniest thing I've read all day.  Can't beat Toronto or Montreal, but think they can hang with the big boys. Good luck, . . . . . . . . . .  you'll need it."
682745,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2012-04-01 22:28:00,0,don't you have a tee time to make?
682746,[email protected],2012-04-01 22:31:00,119,"original.  so when do you choose the next team you will be a ""fan"" of ??"
682747,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2012-04-01 22:32:00,0,FORE!
682748,muskymatt,2012-04-01 22:33:00,2608,"We don't waste our time with the lower teams, however, we did beat the Bruins, Penguins, Flyers and a few other top teams as of late! So keep watchin the SENS with your bitter feelings and remember, the laffs will miss the playoffs again next year, like the last 7."
682749,[email protected],2012-04-01 22:35:00,119,"um, no, will not be watching the senoritas, as they will be out before I blink, like every other year......."
682750,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2012-04-01 22:37:00,0,too bad you guys couldn't take a mulligan on burke eh?
682751,bushart,2012-04-01 22:41:00,2628,Much like the year they went to the finals  An accomplishment not seen in TO since 67--in a 6 team league  so French---safe to assume your a Leaf fan??---I believe if ones gonna talk--they should put up the team they normally cheer for---not just the after season add ons  I admitted up fron in Nov---when Jedi was tellin the world how great the leafs were doin--that I cheered for the Sens---even in the Yashin years
682752,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2012-04-01 22:43:00,0,french is a leafs fan. that's why he doesn't get the comedy/irony of beaking off about the sens getting knocked out of the playoffs when his team can't even make them.
682753,bushart,2012-04-01 22:53:00,2628,Reminds me of the Monty Python Movie---Search for the Holy Grail  The knight just a torso and a head--yellin--come back and fight---it's just a flesh wound
682754,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2012-04-01 22:56:00,0,you mean this?   hahahahahahahahahahah!  come to think of it you'e right!  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKhEw7nD9C4
682756,muskymatt,2012-04-01 22:58:00,2608," bahahahahahahahahahaha...now that's funny :rofl2:  :rofl2:  Sat Morning 10 am, Sens playoff tickets go on sale for those interested "
682758,bushart,2012-04-01 23:04:00,2628,That's the one Doc--perfect--well if he was the blue Knight maybe  Sound familiar with what gets told round here??
682759,muskymatt,2012-04-01 23:05:00,2608, A classic!  
682764,[email protected],2012-04-01 23:23:00,119,"I think it's pretty obvious that I am a Leaf fan. You see, I have obv. been through the lean years, but come sept. the optimism (blind, or otherwise) remains high. I ALWAYS feel this could be the year, and am excited to see how the season will unfold. I watch the games, cheer when they win, am disappointed when they lose. The last few years have been crushing, but come the new season, I will be there, with the same optimism for a great season, as I have before. Playoffs/No Playoffs, I bleed blue and white, and that will never waver, because I am a TRUE FAN !!!!  How many sens fans can say they NEVER cheered for another team?? Toronto/Montreal were likely replaced as soon as the sens came about, loyalty out the window. Some ""fans"".  I'll leave all three of you señorita fans to your love in now. btw- those tickets will be on sale for a while............."
681822,muskymatt,2012-03-30 01:29:00,2608,"Man I love baseball, the blue jays are my favorite team, seems 18000 + at the laff game agree with me!  Gauthier got fired, how long till burkie does?"
681829,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2012-03-30 01:42:00,0,ouch.  jays are looking killer so far though!
681832,Beans,2012-03-30 02:03:00,3339,I agree...Let's go Blue Jays...Let's go !!!
681833,Twocoda,2012-03-30 02:05:00,4130,i always thought baseball would be more entertaining if they removed second base....instead of a pitcher picking off a runner....the runner could pick off the pitcher....
681834,Gerritt,2012-03-30 02:07:00,6129,"OMG.... we have to deal with all the Bull posts in the winter about hockey.... and now all the Bull posts in the summer about baseball?  OFC admins and moderators... I know this not normal on OFC... but make section for the people that seem to find the need to talk hockey, football or baseball.... hell add golf and curling to it.. I do not care.. but how much do we have to endure....  Ugh.  G"

681893,fish_fishburn,2012-03-30 11:32:00,1311,"Dion is the saddest excuse for a capt I have seen in a long time. Running around slashing everone, then refusing to dance on numerous occasions last night. What a joke. Maybe someone should send him some old videos of former captain Wendle Clark. Im not a Leafs fan but always admired how Wendle led his teams."

681952,Lunatic,2012-03-30 14:51:00,536,Clark has always been my favorite player. Just watch 'all heart' video on YouTube. It should be played in the dressing room before all games.
681980,Mike Pike,2012-03-30 16:29:00,1332,"With one of the lower payrolls in the majors, Rogers keeps telling fans that when the Jays are 'close,' that's when they'll spend the money.  Well, when THAT happens, that's when I'll spend MY money."
682015,jedimaster,2012-03-30 18:17:00,3472,"Sal, I would be more worried about your precious Senioritas than the affairs of the Leafs. Only 2 points away from no playoffs.... Wash and Buffalo could put the Sens on the outside looking in... I think Wash plays the habs and Buffalo has a game against pits(on a 2 game losing streak) I'll be watching a few games this weekend. Unfortunatly it won't be the leafs game I have interest in."

Seriously many baseball writers in the States are are really high on the Jays this year!"
