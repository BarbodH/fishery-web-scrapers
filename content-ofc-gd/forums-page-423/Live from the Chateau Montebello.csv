683519,backbay,2012-04-04 04:15:00,773," Carl, I was telling Roy that my family is from up the Rouge River. Did you always live in this neck of the woods?"
682490,Skipper D,2012-04-01 12:58:00,1970,"Hi , i am here this morning at the Chateau Montebello coming to you live , the red carpet has just been rolled out in anticipation of the arrival of OFC's one and only Mod Roy and his wife as they come to enjoy their morning brunch  . We are now gathered out at the main entrance to the Chateau , awaiting to catch a glimpse of their arrival ."
682493,muskymatt,2012-04-01 13:05:00,2608,"I fish right in front of it on many occasions, it's truly a remarkable structure, and a beautiful area. Enjoy your brunch! "
682494,Skipper D,2012-04-01 13:08:00,1970,"Earlyer this morning my wife Beverley and i snuck in side to get a look at the preprations that were being made for todays event , we had a chance to look around and sit for a bit before going back out side ."
682498,Skipper D,2012-04-01 13:12:00,1970,"  You are so right , and for our readers this morning we do have a camera set up pointing towards the river to see if Roy will be out there trying his luck after brunch ."
682510,Skipper D,2012-04-01 13:52:00,1970,We just noticed they are starting to set this morning tables for brunch and we have seen no sign of Roy & J coming thry the front gates as of yet . Its possible that we may have missed them but more likely there were brought in thru the V.I.P entrance . I just checked with security up on the roof and they enform that a group of people were escorted in thru the side of the building . Stay tuned as we move inside .
682516,Rod Caster,2012-04-01 13:59:00,5784,Weird seasons out that way... it's fall already?
682519,Skipper D,2012-04-01 14:04:00,1970,"  Yes , thats just one of the attractions why so many come here for brunch this time of the year ."
682534,Skipper D,2012-04-01 14:19:00,1970,"We are now live from just one of the many dinning rooms here in the south wing at the Chateau Montebello and still no Roy or J , and still no sign of them down in the loby at the fire place"
682539,mercman,2012-04-01 14:36:00,7054, Does Stalker mean any more than a Musky Lure to you
682561,Skipper D,2012-04-01 15:01:00,1970,LOL ... Well folks we've checked up in the attic as well as the two upper floors and as nap time is about to start here we beleive Roy & J have left the building ................. O'  
682562,Skipper D,2012-04-01 15:05:00,1970,"But hold on , we think we may have spoted Roy hidding in the back ground here trying not to be noticed ........ APRIL FOOLS ...."
682564,Skipper D,2012-04-01 15:10:00,1970,Happy April first Roy & J and thank you's for sharing brunch with all of us back here at OFC .  
682805,skeeter,2012-04-02 01:50:00,1907,"Well Roy, how did the brunch go? "
682840,Roy,2012-04-02 09:07:00,13728,"It was very nice, Dann. Except for the few minutes lost being shielded from the one thoothed, 2mega pixel point and shoot toting autograph seekers, we had a fine day.  Matt, just east (maybe 500 yards) of CM there is a baseball diamond and on shore there are dozens of fairly new docks waiting to be dropped in the water. There are a good bunch of picnic tables as well. Would you happen to know if that is a public launch? It appears to be . We took a quick drive up the road to Papineauville as well and there are a couple of launches there."
682844,Skipper D,2012-04-02 10:06:00,1970,"  Glad yous enjoyed your selfs , Half way between there and Papineauville Roy i beleive there is a public launch where the ferry cross's to Cumberland , i watch folks launch their boats there from our motel room balcony in the mornings . A second one is not far from there as well ."
682845,Roy,2012-04-02 10:21:00,13728,"HMMMM I think the ferry you're referring to is between Fassett QC. and Lefaivre On. and that would be the other way....east. The Cumberland ferry would be at least 45kms West of Papineauville between Cumberland On. and Masson-Angers, Qc."
682848,Skipper D,2012-04-02 10:53:00,1970,"  I should have taken out the map .... lol, Last time thru there  it was at Fassett where we stayed , not an easy place to fine a motel at 1:00 in the morning when you don't want to pay the starting rate of 695.00 a night at CM .  How ever the 300.00 VIP suite at Fassett had us sleeping well in no time . Sorry bout the pic's from inside CM, very dim lighting in there and hard to take pictures if you don't bring extra lighting with you ."
682869,Billy Bob,2012-04-02 12:16:00,5865,Great Read..........
682934,craigdritchie,2012-04-02 15:53:00,1586,"Apart from the yacht club at Montebello , the closest launch I know of Roy is the one in Papineauville, right at the end of the main drag. Forget the name of the street but it was named after some Quebec politician. Henri Bourassa?  It would be nice to have a new ramp closer to CM."
682941,Roy,2012-04-02 16:21:00,13728,"Thanks Craig. Yes, I saw that one, It seems like a good ramp too...remains to be seen how busy it is in the warmer season and what kind of parking is available."
683282,Christopheraaron,2012-04-03 16:17:00,3525,"I've been there a few times and stayed in the private cabins, great fishing, I bet you Roy is hiding somewhere in a boat right now!"
683415,carll2,2012-04-03 23:38:00,443,roy!!! you mean you passed grenville on the 50 and didnt stop in to say hi???  :whistling:
683418,Roy,2012-04-03 23:44:00,13728, HA! I certainly did but had NO idea you were there!
683424,carll2,2012-04-03 23:51:00,443,"geeeze i live here now, half a click north when ya take the grenville exit"
683433,Roy,2012-04-04 00:04:00,13728,K...didn't get off there though...straight into Montebello at the end of the line.
