683198,BITEME,2012-04-03 11:42:00,1968,What you bought was a buck tag and to get your antlerless oppurtunity sticker go to SERVICE ONTARIO with the section you wish to hunt and they will date stamp it and send it to the ministry proper
683552,DaveMc,2012-04-04 12:15:00,89,"you can only apply for the antler-less tag by going online to ontario.ca/outdoorscard , phone it in to 1-800-288-1155 or go to service ontario and do it in person. the mnr eliminated the mail in application this year."
