683287,Dave Bailey,2012-04-03 16:29:00,1641,We're at the mercy of speculators (ain't the free market system great?) and unstable governments in countries that have a crapload of oil. Nothing we can do about it. If the government tried to regulate the market there would be screams from the billionaires who line their pockets. Until we start using less the price will keep going up.

Bunch of 's   Harper warns U.S. some Canadian oil will go to Asia   Prime Minister Stephen Harper has put the United States on notice that Canadian crude will start flowing to Asia as a result of American rejection of the Keystone XL pipeline project.  It wasn't a threat, but rather an explanation of the position in which Canada finds itself as a consequence of the rejection.  Harper told those gathered to hear him speak at the Woodrow Wilson Centre that the very fact that ""no"" was even uttered over the building of the Keystone XL underscores to Canada that it can't put the sale of its oil in the one American basket.  The PM continued with the strong language and said ""we cannot be, as a country, in a situation where really our one and, in many cases, almost only energy partner could say no to our energy products.""  Harper also pointed out that Canada has been selling oil to the U.S. at a discounted price, which will change when the Asian sales make the oilsands crude more competitive."
683291,Raf,2012-04-03 17:03:00,3495,Build refining capacity in Canada already.  Why sell our oil only to buy it back?  I understand this takes time (and money).
683295,Rod Caster,2012-04-03 17:12:00,5784," Atlantic Canada imports it's oil from the middle east ...maybe we should try to supply ourselves first, instead of making threats to canadians, which subsequently raises the gas prices until the Canadian people are in favor of anything that brings the gas prices back to earth."
683300,zamboniwaterboy,2012-04-03 17:25:00,126,We really do need to rally as a nation and get our resources back under the control of the population of Canada!  Stop giving it away and screwing ourselves!  The government needs to start worrying more about the little guy than the billionaires. Michael
