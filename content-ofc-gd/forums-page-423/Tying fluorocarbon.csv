683040,Curtisss,2012-04-02 23:22:00,25,What do you think would be the highest pound test fluorocarbon that you could still effectively tie onto braided line without using crimps?
683058,kickingfrog,2012-04-03 00:00:00,8333,It depends on what type of knot you use.  http://www.animatedknots.com/  The line brands site's will also have knot information.  There are apps as well.
683062,Curtisss,2012-04-03 00:04:00,25,"I'm planning 80lb flouro to a 50lb braid. Don't mind learning new knots, I'll check that site out."
683065,Roy,2012-04-03 00:19:00,13728,Are you planning on the knot going through the guides?
683066,Roy,2012-04-03 00:21:00,13728,Is this going to be a semi-permanent leader?
683067,Curtisss,2012-04-03 00:26:00,25,Basically just a tooth protector.  About a foot at the most.
683070,Roy,2012-04-03 00:34:00,13728,"A little more work but I think your best bet would be to do it in two steps...braid to a 12"" 40lb fluoro then the 40 to a 12"" 80lb fluoro."
683073,JoshS,2012-04-03 00:42:00,729,Why not just make leaders with a swivel to connect?  
683074,Curtisss,2012-04-03 00:42:00,25,"Hmm, I hadn't thought of that. What kind of knots would you suggest?"
683076,Roy,2012-04-03 00:49:00,13728,Double uni on both....maybe 7 wraps on the braid/fluoro knot then 5 wraps on the fluoro/fluoro should be good. Lube the knots before you cinch them down.
683079,Roy,2012-04-03 00:54:00,13728,You can also join the 50lb braid to the 80lb Fluoro using about a number 3 swivel.
683084,Roy,2012-04-03 00:58:00,13728,"But then the easiest way would be to make or buy 80lb fluoro leaders. They sell them in 12"" lengths ...swivel at one end and a snap at the other. About $6. each to buy."
683085,Curtisss,2012-04-03 00:58:00,25,"Awesome, thanks."
683131,mike rousseau,2012-04-03 02:46:00,4661, 130lb....
683132,Roy,2012-04-03 02:50:00,13728,I tie 130lb leaders all the time. The question was 50lb braid to 80 lb fluoro.
683161,Roy,2012-04-03 04:48:00,13728," No, he edited his post."
683172,Fish Farmer,2012-04-03 10:22:00,2234,"Tie a uni around the fluoro with the braid, then melt the fluoro with a match, it makes a ball on the end of the floro that won't pull though."
683225,Curtisss,2012-04-03 13:06:00,25,"I only edited to fix a spelling mistake. Wasn't trying to start a contest though. Thanks for all the replies, great info."
