682604,Fisherman,2012-04-01 17:08:00,7201,"Well, I can't see why not, you use it for other fish, I don't think it would take maybe 2-3 minutes in the deep fryer. Here's a few: http://www.google.ca/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=deep%20fry%20shrimp%20batter&source=web&cd=1&ved=0CCoQFjAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cooks.com%2Frec%2Fsearch%2F0%2C1-00%2Cshrimp_batter_for_deep_frying%2CFF.html&ei=oIt4T_fMLObV0QGPm6GQDQ&usg=AFQjCNG0pA839qOgNt4hvsvoJycruVV_Zg&cad=rja"

682671,krixxer,2012-04-01 19:53:00,274,You need some panko bread crumbs and tampura mix.  Slivers of coconut will ballance nice with some spicy mango dip.  If you have the time butterfly the shrimp; just make it look nice
682782,fishing,2012-04-02 00:09:00,167,Healthy and tasty ones all start with real yeast.

TAKE ALL SEASON SPICE...THE KNOW THE STUFF THAT HAS A RED LOOK TO IT. MIX EVERYTHING TOGETHER AND ADD SEASONING TO TOP OF BATTER UNTIL BATTER LOOKS A LITTLE REDISH IN COLOUR. MAKE SURE THE FAT IS NICE AND HOT AND YOU WILL HAVE A VERY EASY BATTER AND TASTE GREAT."
