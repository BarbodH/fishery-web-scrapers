682789,Rustic-Fisher,2012-04-02 00:33:00,826,Stole/borrowed my wife's good camera for an hour and snapped a few pics of my GSP Jasper being crazy and pointing a few birds along the way. Some how  that same camera will make its way to the steelhead stream this week for some pics   
682793,workwear,2012-04-02 00:56:00,592,what a beauty.....!!!!
682798,backbay,2012-04-02 01:18:00,773,Jasper's a handsome pup!
682827,Twocoda,2012-04-02 03:27:00,4130,its alotta fun isnt it ...i love the time i spend with the dogs and the camera....almost as good as fishing...  First pic.....AMAZING if only you could have caught his full reflection in the water while in the air but still an awesome shot!!!  Second pic.....Black and whites expose the soul of a subject  Third Pic.....Colour exposes the collar and his pedigree jewels which incidentally might cost you yours if you take the wifes camera to the river and wreck it ...  Nice shooting
682834,Sinker,2012-04-02 04:46:00,8692,Great photos! The jumping shot is awesome!  S.
682839,misfish,2012-04-02 08:37:00,29133,That first shot is awesome.
682841,solopaddler,2012-04-02 09:08:00,8605,Beautiful dog!
682842,Roy,2012-04-02 09:10:00,13728,"Yes, great shots, brings back my recollections of Big Cliffs best friend, Andy."
682876,Rustic-Fisher,2012-04-02 12:34:00,826," Lol, I know nothing about cameras, photos or photography in general. It is something I could see getting into though. I will carefully borrow it again today with a different lens and hopefully hit the river. Shhhh!"
682880,NAW,2012-04-02 13:14:00,4022,Greats shots man!
682910,4x4bassin,2012-04-02 14:43:00,1025,Great shots !
683088,Rustic-Fisher,2012-04-03 01:09:00,826,Told you I'd get a hold of that camera today Hit the water for an hour and got a few 2-3lb fish. R  
683108,solopaddler,2012-04-03 01:48:00,8605,"  Now you're talking, that's my kind of water!  Do you ever bring Jasper with you? Just wondering if it's possible to keep this breed out of the water LOL!"
683214,Rustic-Fisher,2012-04-03 12:38:00,826,"No, though Jasper is a great house pet he's more of a utility dog. As soon as that collar goes on he's searching for birds, he would have a 2 min attention span when fishing and would no doubt try to retrieve every float cast. When he got bored with that Im sure he would just look at me as if to say ""this sucks I got birds to find"" and he'd be on his way. My boxer will sit patiently so he's the fishing dog of the house.
