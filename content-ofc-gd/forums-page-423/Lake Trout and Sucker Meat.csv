A couple weeks ago I salted up about 75 shinners (they turned out good) but there seems to be alot of info. on the web about using sucker meat ! I do alot of jigging so I was thinking what would be best to put on the bucktail , salted shinner or some sucker . All I can think of is that the sucker is a bit more oily giving off a good scent trail but not sure . Is it worth taking up some sucker strips as well . We have good luck with the shinners but just looking for some more ideas from the board . Any one use sucker meat for lake trout ?  Thanks"

Usually jigging with bad boy type lures, Never really had the need to tip any spoons.  I have fished with some older gents on temagami who tip there spoons and jigs with the Uncle Josh ripple rinds, not sure if you can get those anymore but I saw lakers caught on that"
682004,bushart,2012-03-30 17:52:00,2628,Over the years I've had good success with sucker meat--incl jigging  I would freeze the suckers whole---take em out couple hours before use----find a rock before you launch  carve into chunks---scales skin--l'il guts and all---all makes a great scent trail
