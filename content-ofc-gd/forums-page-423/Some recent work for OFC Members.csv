682286,Spiel,2012-03-31 17:40:00,9065,"Keeping busy in the rod shop for some of our members so I thought I'd share a few pictures.  First a Sage fly rod for Ctranter....      The completed handle for Floatman55      A quick look at the reel seat for the rod I'll be guiding tomorrow, heading to Troutguy upon completion.    And another handle shot for Misfish's new steelie rod.  "
682288,mercman,2012-03-31 17:47:00,7054,"Truly fine work Chris! You are a skilled artist, there is no doubt.Love the detail in the the first pic.  Awesome Chris!"
682289,Spiel,2012-03-31 17:51:00,9065," Thanks Paul. But I can't take credit for the custom handle on that one, I merely fit and installed it. I believe the guy Ctranter commisioned for the handle is out in Alaska."

Anyone looking to have something made up should shoot Chris a msg or email. great guy to work with, amazing workmenship and a high standard of quality.  won't be the last rod he builds for me"
682343,solopaddler,2012-03-31 20:47:00,8605, Agreed Ryan. The choice of wood and metal hardware were a particularly good choice on your part!  It all looks oddly familiar.

683186,Spiel,2012-04-03 11:12:00,9065, Thanks Landry. I'm sure your rods are just fine and I can assure you that my first rods 37 years ago weren't all that pretty but they were functional and I was proud of them. Truth is after all these years I'm still improving and refining my work with every rod.   Thank you Josh.    You know where to find me Cliff.
