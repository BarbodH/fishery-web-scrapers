I thought i remember reading posts last year of people getting ice out whities and thought that was around april.  Did the regs change or am i just mis-remembering when ice out was?  I didn't think it was THAT late last year...just curious.  Thanks,  AA."

682885,alphaalpha,2012-04-02 13:32:00,475,  heh ya i know i saw that was just curious if it changed since last year or was ice out really not till that late last year?
682899,BillM,2012-04-02 14:12:00,17367, It's never changed..  Ice is always out way before the whitefish opener on Lake Simcoe.
