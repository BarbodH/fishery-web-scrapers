683549,Billy Bob,2012-04-04 12:08:00,5865,So OLD MAN....when you gonna hit the river.....might be able to meet you down there...
683551,Roy,2012-04-04 12:15:00,13728,I should be there Saturday and Sunday...no fixed itinerary that I know of.
683553,Billy Bob,2012-04-04 12:22:00,5865,"Oh, I'll be out of town......but you'll be back...maybe then...the Niagara will draw you back once you experienced it..."
683585,Harrison,2012-04-04 15:26:00,2202," Sorry Mike, you left out two drift socks, tungsten pencil weights, a pop r and a moss boss.  Your Fired, new ad up in busniess section looking for help.  "
683618,Ainsley,2012-04-04 16:41:00,142,If you plan on bottom Bouncing I would suggest pre-tying a bunch of three-way rigs. I tie 8-16 and store them on those lindy rig wraps. I've also seen guys use pipe insulation.
683093,Roy,2012-04-03 01:21:00,13728,"Well I can't get any GLtrout for the tourney from here so this weekend I'm hitting the lower Niagara. Anyone one got any hot tips for me? Keep it clean.  I imagine I'll be drifting but hey, I'm a complete noob at this so any help would be most welcome and certainly appreciated. Thanks folks."
683098,solopaddler,2012-04-03 01:29:00,8605,  Hey cool! Can I assume you'll be in a boat?  If you're at all interested in a little walk and wade fishing for even half a day I'd be happy to guide you on a different system not too far from the Niagara.  Lots of fish guaranteed. My little guy put over 20 on the bank himself recently.
683102,Roy,2012-04-03 01:34:00,13728,"Thanks Mike I really appreciate the offer. I'll be with some others there so I don't yet know what the itinerary is like but I'll let you know as soon as I have something. And your "" lil guy"" is starting to make me sick y'know that?  Thanks Mike, I'll let you know really quickly."
683110,fishdawg,2012-04-03 01:51:00,912,here a tip Roy  make sure you do a fine net job on my teamates fish
683114,Roy,2012-04-03 01:56:00,13728, Here's a better one Mark.....your teamates are also my teamates cause we're both on the same team.
683116,solopaddler,2012-04-03 01:57:00,8605," No problem Roy and take your time, no rush. Anytime you're down this way you've got an open invite."
683181,Steve Piggott,2012-04-03 10:58:00,196,"Bring a minnow net, there should be lots of minnows at the launch."
683184,Roy,2012-04-03 11:00:00,13728,"That's a good idea Steve, thanks."
683251,CoolB,2012-04-03 14:06:00,47,When I went with Aaron Shirley all we did was a single small egg on a tiny tiny hook with home made Lindy style sinkers. Can't remember the size of the hooks. BTW Hi Roy. Long time. Good luck.
683252,Harrison,2012-04-03 14:09:00,2202,"bring some shiver shads, finesse fish or other fluke style baits with ya."
683254,Roy,2012-04-03 14:15:00,13728,"Thanks Aaron! Nice to hear from you.  Ok Phil, now I have to go shopping again?"
683266,Harrison,2012-04-03 14:45:00,2202," Naw, I am sure you have some kicking around.  Or sassy shads."
683280,niagarangler89,2012-04-03 15:58:00,23,"From what I've been hearing, rainbow spawn has been the go-to bait down there recently. I haven't fished it for a couple of weeks, but when I was down there last, I had a couple good takes on streamers. I was float fishing (from shore), but I imagine they're gorging on the same stuff further out as well  Water should be crystal clear for the foreseeable future; no SW winds in the forecast. Another point to keep in mind is that the daytime water levels are now back to the summertime average. The bows should be stacking up pretty good in there right now, so best of luck Roy!"
683289,Snidley,2012-04-03 16:40:00,620,"U-B-Fishing eggs were always good from a boat but other plastic eggs work well too. They hold on the hook better than natural eggs. If the water is clear the trout usually hold on the second ledge and beyond out from the shoreline. One guy used to drift spinners instead of eggs and flies. Never tried it but from shore spinners, spoons, crankbaits and jigs, both bucktail and plastic, work well. A New York State license is pretty much a must as well since, from a boat,there are more drifts on the New York state side."
683296,Billy Bob,2012-04-03 17:13:00,5865,"Egg sacks and or Kwickfish lures drifted on a 3 way rig is the basic set up in the lower Niagara River....get out early, especially if your fishing on a weekend....many good drifts along the Canadian and NYS side of the river.....if things are slow head down river and drift or TROLL near the mouth for coho's and or brown trout that are in the shallows right now along the shore line. You shouldn't have any trouble catching lots of fish right now if the weather holds.  Good Luck, Bob"
683332,knightfisher,2012-04-03 19:30:00,237,"The smelt run has started in the lower. As well as millions of minnows. Also Queenston launch is a zoo starting about 4pm till well after midnight. Just in case you may be launching there, cars are backed up to the top parking lot.    Dan"
683337,Spiel,2012-04-03 19:53:00,9065,I'll tell you everything you need to know Roy (or not) when you stop in for a beer.
683347,misfish,2012-04-03 20:13:00,29133,  You must be special Roy. I didnt get offered a beer.  Yu believe they still drink coffee at 10:30 AM?  Have a great time brudder.
683353,Spiel,2012-04-03 20:37:00,9065," Come on Brian, you were offered you just declined cause Mama was with you."
683364,MJL,2012-04-03 20:48:00,2427," You'll need some soft plastic minnows (Gulp, Fin-S, etc), soft plastic eggs (exude, Trigger-X, Jensen egg, etc), box of coloured beads, various streamer flies that imitate smelt and emerald shiners, a variety of Kwikfish, spinners and spoons, pink worms in sizes 3"" to 6"", marabou & bunny jigs, tons of leader material and split shots (just in case you lose lots), hooks in sizes 2 through 14, a new centrepin reel and a new float rod (make that 2 combos)  Phil said I get a 25% commission on each sale made from you"
683376,Joey,2012-04-03 21:44:00,9122," Look forward to the advice too Chris, see you Friday"
683380,misfish,2012-04-03 21:58:00,29133,"  Im my own boss,,,,,,Did I say that out loud,,,,,,,,,   Get back to work pilgrum."
683381,misfish,2012-04-03 22:00:00,29133," J, you do know if you don,t keep Paul in the truck,fishing comes second.LOL  Have a great time guys,and gal."
683383,Spiel,2012-04-03 22:07:00,9065," Work is done for the day, you're second on the list and moving up fast."
683543,Roy,2012-04-04 11:46:00,13728,"Thanks everyone. It's still hard to believe how much help is available here. With Emails, personal messages and of course this thread, I've received tons of valuable information to help me out. Thanks again and I should be able to answer the rest of the messages some time this morning."
