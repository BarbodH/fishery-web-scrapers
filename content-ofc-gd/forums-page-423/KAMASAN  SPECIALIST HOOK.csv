682500,mbac31,2012-04-01 13:14:00,904,Im looking for this style of hook or similar but in a Stainless version. I cant seem to locate any around here or close by. Looking for sizes from 16-6  Thanks
682503,mike rousseau,2012-04-01 13:34:00,4661,I'd check some saltwater sites or something... I kind find much in stainless steel...especially that small...   What do you want them for?  I've never had a Kamasan rust...
682518,mbac31,2012-04-01 14:02:00,904,Im doing  trip for Sea Trout in two weeks. I have the other ones but they tend to rust quick. I have the fly tying hooks in stainless but the wrong bend. Might have to modify them maybe.
682886,Hairpy,2012-04-02 13:35:00,73,"Circle hooks is what you need man and not small ones, we were getting trout over 5 lbs down there a few weeks ago. I think mustad makes em.  Good Luck !  Joseph"
