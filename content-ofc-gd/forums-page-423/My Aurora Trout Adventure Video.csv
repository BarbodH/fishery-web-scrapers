680439,cl_fishin,2012-03-27 02:00:00,138,"We tried to document our quest for an Aurora Trout last fall including the getting to and from adventure part. Was disappointed with what was useable (not enough actual fishing) and the video quality, but it is what it is, and I did what I could with it. Not much video of these fish out there so I thought I would share it anyway. I will be upgrading my video cam this season. Hope you enjoy I have a few more adventures to share once the are edited  Aurora Trout Adventure"

680454,Nipfisher,2012-03-27 02:19:00,2449,Way to go. I'm going to try a lake near my home town. Lived there for 20 years and never fished it when it was open.
680484,Musky or Specks,2012-03-27 11:10:00,2710,Your video wasn't very specific as to what was successful. Float rod and float obviously. Slip float? How much lead how much water what kind of structure bait and how it was rigged. I ask because I've been twice now and have had the same results as Tyler.

680524,cl_fishin,2012-03-27 14:19:00,138,"I caught him on a fixed float rig with the bait suspended about 4 feet down casting it right up close (almost into) the biggest laydown tree, on the steepest bank in the lake. Focused our fishing during prime times, low light morning and evening when they were most active. I really thought they would be easier to catch like Brookies but the were actually pretty tough, probably got alot of fishing pressure, and the lake was thick with minnows."
680530,Moosebunk,2012-03-27 14:31:00,3970,"Very cool guys.  That's the essence of ""fish, friendship and adventure"" right there in 9 minutes.  Good catch."
680783,the spirit of fishing,2012-03-28 01:06:00,141,I really enjoyed that. Many videos drag on after a few minutes-yours left me wanting more! Excellent job.
680787,Joeytier,2012-03-28 01:08:00,3990,Excellent video.  You've got me motivated to sort out my camping gear
680987,Rod Caster,2012-03-28 13:23:00,5784,"  no kidding eh? ... actually, I'm already way ahead of you  I have to wait another two years until the closest Aurora lake is open again.  Nice catch and video, CL"
681551,fishin jesus,2012-03-29 15:58:00,53,"hey there, i was going to go fish for Aurora Trout this year but I thought it was in the Regs. that you could only catch 1 fish ( your choice to keep it or not ) then you had to leave. That kept me from going . You can't even catch and release the fish.....just catch 1 then leave the water.  i obviously miss understood the regs............and i'm in 100% this year.  Beauty fish!!!!!"
681678,Jer,2012-03-29 20:32:00,1426,"  That's exactly what they said, one fish per day (released or not) and you're done."
681693,Walleye'm Fishing,2012-03-29 21:00:00,310,"Nice fish dude, congrats."
681757,cl_fishin,2012-03-29 23:17:00,138,"Yes the rule is one fish, released or kept and you are done, per day. You can fish again the next day provided you ate or released the fish previously"
682871,fishin jesus,2012-04-02 12:23:00,53,"I think getting a picture of just 1 is worth effort !!!  That's quite the accomplishment...........pulling out a picture of you holding an Aurora Trout basically is like holding a "" Trump card"" , when it comes fish bragging sessions !!! . i've seen l;ots of Trophy Pike and Bass but NEVER could they compare to Aurora Trout !!!!!!!!11"
