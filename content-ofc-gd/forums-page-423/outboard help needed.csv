681003,Billy Bob,2012-03-28 14:21:00,5865,"Mike, sometimes all these parts can get to your memory when it comes to putting her back together........my tip is have your camera near by and take some photos as your tearing her down....then if your not quite sure you can go back and look at your photos.  Just consider that ""The Tip of the Day""....   Bob"
681010,ecmilley,2012-03-28 14:36:00,2163,"yup i use my camera when i do teardowns as well, like when i put a 150 evinrude back together after 7 months apart"
681014,mike rousseau,2012-03-28 14:39:00,4661,  thats a good idea... maybe even video everything... then if it goes well...i can put her on the net to show others...
681020,mike rousseau,2012-03-28 15:00:00,4661,so for me to do the carbs i will will need 3 gasket kits...one for each carb right?  i think i found em here... #2 in the parts list... i think its all the gaskets within the carbs... is that all i need? 3 of those kits?  and maybe 6 of part number 22? just in case...?   http://www.boats.net/parts/search/Honda/Outboard%20Engine/2000/BF40AY%20LHTA%20VIN%23%20BAYS-3200001%20TO%20BAYS-3209999/CARBURETOR/parts.html
681103,Sinker,2012-03-28 17:52:00,8692,Did you replace the gas line yet?
681112,mike rousseau,2012-03-28 18:16:00,4661,  i will... i just havent had time yet...  and my canadian tire only has the crappy gas line... so i have to find the good lines somewhere...  whether or not the gas line fixes the problem im still gunna clean the carbs because every so often my needle valve is getting blocked open... so i have debris floating around in there somewhere...
681118,Billy Bob,2012-03-28 18:22:00,5865,Any decent auto parts store should have flexible gas line for you....comes in bulk rolls down here.....I'm sure it should up there too.
681122,davey buoy,2012-03-28 18:24:00,5505," Change the needle and seat,quite a common problem"
683095,mike rousseau,2012-04-03 01:23:00,4661,well...  changed the fuel line and that did nothing.... but thanks for the suggestion...over and over and over...lol  turned out when i was having the top end issues and it was running rough... my spark plugs got really dirty... so i cleaned em up with sandpaper and brake cleaner...  took it for a spin tonight and all seems fine... running great.... full top end power for a long ride... and dropped to idle 5-6 time and smooth idle every time.... trolling great... nice and slow...    so i am still planning on cleaning the carbs because i have the parts ordered anyways... and i was having issues with the needle valve being blocked open... so a good cleaning and new gaskets should take care of that off and on problem... and the motor should be 100% again...  hopefully...   mike
683142,Sinker,2012-04-03 03:18:00,8692,"So you changed the gas line, cleaned the plugs, and its running great. Imagine that! Great news!  S."
683200,mike rousseau,2012-04-03 11:52:00,4661,  If that's how YOU wanna look at it.....Lol  IM looking at it as the primer ball and spark plugs were the only steps that produced results... And fixed the problems...  And the $100 for a new fuel pump....$6 for a fuel filter...and $20 for fuel lines and SS hose clamps... Did nothing but eliminate possible problems...  I also ran the boat on the water after each step so I knew wich ones worked...  Thanks to everyone for giving me a hand...  I'll be cleaning the carbs in a week or so and might have some new questions then...  Mike   ...
683331,lovetofish,2012-04-03 19:12:00,500,Change the plugs!  There cheap and have already caused you problems!  LTF
683378,tightline,2012-04-03 21:50:00,322,  check your oil...I had the same prob on a honda 5hp last year turns out it was low on oil and has a built in shut down valve when it gets too hot.
683492,Sinker,2012-04-04 02:35:00,8692,"Why do you think your plugs fouled?  It doesn't really matter to me, I could honestly care less, but If you had of just got the fuel line from the start, you would have been done with this long ago.  Anyways, enjoy your time on the water!!  Oh, and you should definitely replace those plugs!!"
679847,Sinker,2012-03-25 17:52:00,8692,"You should of listened the first time I said it and got the gas line, then you would be out fishing right now  I had the EXACT problem with my 40hp last spring. New fuel line, and a good dose of seafoam and she was good as new.....I did the same as you, replaced the filter, checked the pump, took a part the tank....it was the line, and that was it. When I took it off and cut it open, it was totally eaten up inside. I have a feeling you have the same issue.  I don't mind if you don't want to take my advice. I'm only trying to save you a few bucks and some of your time. A gas line is cheaper than your filter.....I got a new one at CT for less than $40.   S."
679850,mike rousseau,2012-03-25 17:58:00,4661, I'm taking all the advice given... And thanks a lot... You've all been helpful... But once I realized my gas was draining out of the line back to the tank... Made me think that it is the check valve in the primer... If not... New lines.... I haven't done the lines because I hate the cheap crap lines at CT stores... Stiff as hell... The stuff I use stays soft and suple for years and years... But can't get it on the weekend...
679852,mike rousseau,2012-03-25 17:59:00,4661,And the filter was $5 And tge primer was $6
679861,Sinker,2012-03-25 18:25:00,8692,"The line I got at CT is soft. I know the hard ones your talking about, and I wouldn't buy one of them either. Mine is grey in colour if that makes any difference.  Hope ya get her going! There is nothing worse than an engine that's not working right!  s."
679864,mike rousseau,2012-03-25 18:29:00,4661,oh ok... ill check it out then...  thanks again
679900,mike rousseau,2012-03-25 20:08:00,4661,changed the primer ball and the fuel filter...both the old ones seemed fine tho..  took it for a rip... my top end issues seem to be gone...             however...  :wallbash:  :wallbash:  :wallbash:     now im having issues at idle...running super rough... but not all the time... just sometimes...then sometimes it idles fine for a while... then gets rougher and rougher...   i think im gunna just have to bite the bullet and get my carbs cleaned by a pro...   thanks for all the help...
679905,Sinker,2012-03-25 20:15:00,8692,Give her a heavy dose of seafoam.  S.

679911,Sinker,2012-03-25 20:22:00,8692,"I still think its his fuel line. It needs to be replaced, not just the primer bulb.  I wish I had a picture of what mine looked like inside, it was crazy!!  S."
679916,GbayGiant,2012-03-25 20:45:00,1780,Replace the hose. What do you have to lose?
679919,mike rousseau,2012-03-25 20:52:00,4661,ill try the fuel line...because it should probably be changed either way...but when i cut the fuel line to install the new primer ball... the inside of the hose looked like new...  and ive been running seafoam in every tank since October...2-3 trips out a week till christmas... then at least once a month this winter... so its seen some seafoam to say the least... im also having an off and on problem with my needle valve getting blocked in my carbs... i really think they need a good cleaning...  but ill try new gas lines and see what happens...  and this tank has 4-5 gallons of fresh super and half a can of seafoam...
679941,mukluk,2012-03-25 22:02:00,196,As Sinker recommended.....you should change the fuel line Mike.    Had the same thing happen to me last summer.  Could not believe the problem was the fuel line;  looked fine however the the inside had collapsed and was starving the engine of fuel under load etc.
680010,Fisherman,2012-03-25 23:53:00,7201,"I'm betting one thing that almost everyone forgets to do in the fall(those that drain everything) is to drain the hose and all other fuel lines under the cowl.  Leave gas in there for 6 months and I'm thinking ugly things happening in there, and then first thing in the spring, you pump that into the carbs...yech."
680020,mike rousseau,2012-03-26 00:10:00,4661, The longest my boat went without hitting the water this winter was 3-4 weeks...

680914,Freshtrax,2012-03-28 04:42:00,2215,Pull the carbs and clean them.  If you can change a tire on a car you can clean your own carbs it takes 30 min on my 700 polaris
680951,mike rousseau,2012-03-28 12:33:00,4661,I'm pretty confident in myself that I could clean em... Problem is getting to em... There lots of other stuff if have to take apart to get to em...  I think I'll try to find a garage I can set up in for a day... Then I can set up a table to keep all the parts is order...  Can you just clean em up or do you need to replace gaskets and everything?
680955,Fisherman,2012-03-28 12:39:00,7201,"Unless they are fall apart clean, some of the paper gaskets may stick to one side of a part rendering them useless.

679491,irishfield,2012-03-24 22:46:00,26272,Built in tank or portable?

679512,Sinker,2012-03-24 23:06:00,8692,"Replace your gas line, with one good for ethanol, then run some seafoam thru it. I had the same problem with mine last spring. S."
679517,Fisherman,2012-03-24 23:11:00,7201,"The hoses have been approved since at least 1996 for up to 10% ethanol. Seafoam yes,  did you actually see how hard it is to get the gas to flow through the filter?"
679518,Sinker,2012-03-24 23:14:00,8692,"I still say a new gas line and some seafoam will clear it up. Something is gummed up in there, and starving the engine of fuel.  S."
679523,John Bacon,2012-03-24 23:21:00,3277,I think the fuel filter is the most likely culprit. But I have heard of a similar problem caused by a leaky float in the carburator.
679531,davey buoy,2012-03-24 23:45:00,5505, Or a sticking float?
679535,ecmilley,2012-03-24 23:54:00,2163,"sounds likw the filter is plugging up to me, but also a 12 year old fuel line is probably breaking down inside as well or possible small crack in pick up tube in tank or sock on pick up in tank is dirty, borrow a tank and line and try it if it still does it put in a fuel filter. seafoam is a good idea for maintenance as well"
679558,Freshtrax,2012-03-25 00:27:00,2215,"Fuel line, filter, and i would pull the carbs and check everything out before you too end up with melted pistons."
679560,mike rousseau,2012-03-25 00:29:00,4661,im leaning towards fuel filter...  ive been running seafoam in every tank all fall and winter... so i dont think something got gummed up.... and my boat was used all winter...so gas didnt sit...  i think ill try the filter tomorrow...  keep the suggestions coming guys...   thanks
679568,Fisherman,2012-03-25 00:40:00,7201,"As much as it doesn't sound right, I use the slightly larger see through filters from Princess Auto instead of the crazy priced OEM dinky little Honda gas filters.  If anything gets trapped, I can see it, and for the price they get changed on a yearly basis.  If the intank sock(filter) is plugged, undo the fule line at the tank and gently insert a Robertson tip screwdriver against the ball bearing on the tank fitting.  Any fuel left in the line will run down and backflush crud around the sock."
679574,mike rousseau,2012-03-25 00:45:00,4661,  same here....  also got my fuel filter in the states... shipped to the border for $90 total... to buy in cornwall... $190+tax!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  always trying to save a buck
679659,perodimi,2012-03-25 02:35:00,124,"I had a friend with that problem last year and we figured out it was the primer bulb itself. There's a one way check valve inside to prevent backflow to the tank and if that's failed, the engine may not be able to draw enough suction especially at higher RPM. The bulb itself may appear to be full but fuel back flow is difficult to detect.  Just a thought?  Peter"
679693,GYPSY400,2012-03-25 06:52:00,191,"Replace the fuel hose assembly, complete with primer bulb.. It is most likely collapsing inside, or an issue with the bulb check valve."
679709,bigbuck,2012-03-25 12:24:00,2449," Start from the tank to The engine. My bet is that the pickup has degraded in the tank. Feul lines are ethanol resistant, not ethanol proof. The pickup sits in the fuel constantly. My buddy had this issue last year.  If this isn't it then look closely at the venting for the tank. Good luck."
679712,mike rousseau,2012-03-25 12:31:00,4661,  From my understanding...wich is based only on Internet research... Is that if it was a problem at the tank (portable in my boat) the primer ball would go soft... And it's staying firm...  At least there are only so many things to slow down fuel...  Thanks
679739,Sinker,2012-03-25 14:05:00,8692,"I'm telling ya, try another fuel line. How old is the one on there now?  If you have to prime the ball for it to get enough fuel to run, your line is not working properly, or you have an air leak.  Obvioulsy the pump is working if its running at all, and clearly fuel is getting thru the filter.  I think the problem is getting fuel from the tank to the engine.    S."

679769,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2012-03-25 14:52:00,0,"dumb question, but i can only ask it because i've done it myself...  was the air open on the gas tank?  my first inclination was a fuel pump problem as well because priming the bulb in fact is replacing the action of a functioning pump.  i'm not sure with outboards, but when a friends snowmobile was starved for fuel, i fixed the problem for him by buying and installing a fuel pump rebuild kit.  it wasn't expensive and was easy to do as long as you pay close attention to the order and direction of the 3 membranes inside.  do they make these for outboards?  as sinker has suggested there are all kinds of invisible problems you can have with your line as well... the fittings at the tank, bulb, and motor can wear and allow air to enter when the motor is drawing the hardest.  as someone else mentioned, lines can actually collapse on the inside if they are well worn.  i'm assuming you checked for visible cracks etc.  best way to check is to borrow a buddies gas tank for a day (just changing the lines won't diagnose a problem on the tank fittings, inside the tank).  if your motor runs fine with someone elses tank then problem solved.  if it doesn't you know you can look at your filter/pump."
679773,mike rousseau,2012-03-25 15:00:00,4661,  Air was open... I've forgot it before and my Honda will colapse the tank before it effects performance...  I'm gunna try a new fuel filter today since I already have a spare...  If that doesn't work I'll borrow the tank and line off of my dads boat...   Hopefully one of those 2 works...  I'm really hoping the fuel filter works do I don't have to go to the cottage to get dads tank...  And they do make fuel pump kits for outboards... All makes except Honda...lol... That's why I changed the whole fuel pump...    ...
679811,mike rousseau,2012-03-25 16:24:00,4661,changed the filter and ran the motor at low rpms for a bit... and it seems my filter is emptying way to fast... like its draining back to the tank... so i think you guys are right about the primer bulb... so im gunna go get one and change that before i take it for a ride later...  and the old fuel filter seemed to be clean... i blew on the intake of the new and old filters with equal resistance...  also... some of my fuel line connections only have the spring type clamps... and i watched the fuel filter when i primed it and the connection leaked a bit... so im gunna get some small hose clamps to tighten up those connections properly...  hopefully ill have an update later today...and hopefully its good news...
679835,Sinker,2012-03-25 17:23:00,8692,Just go get yourself a new gas line and be done with it.  S.
679846,mike rousseau,2012-03-25 17:45:00,4661, Why not replace the whole fuel system...?  I'm doing one thing at a time trying to save money...
