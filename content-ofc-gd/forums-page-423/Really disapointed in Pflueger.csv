682590,young_one,2012-04-01 16:17:00,620,"Interesting topic! Don't mean to jump on the band wagon, but my Pfluger Patriarch's anti-reserves failed on me yesterday when I was fishing for crappies."
682700,coreyhkh,2012-04-01 20:58:00,163, that blows they are prob made in the same factory. I have 3 presidents and have put those though hell one I got in High school and didn't treat my stuff like I do now.
682818,blaque,2012-04-02 02:46:00,2419,I've had a couple pflueger presidents for a couple few years now and theyve served flawlessly. That's my experience anyway
682836,Sinker,2012-04-02 05:18:00,8692,"I have 3 presidents, that get used mostly by the kids, and they've worked perfect from day one. I use them on the ice as well, so they've caught a few fish and been banged around plenty!  For $50 ya can't go wrong!  S."
682348,coreyhkh,2012-03-31 21:00:00,163,"So last year I bought two supreme Xt spinning reels they work really good very smooth and light, anyway have about a month I was fishing for carp and I go to cast and boom the reel blows up and the bails falls into the water, I take it back to bass-pro and get an exchange and all is good. Until today I take my rod out and after a few casts bang it happens again but this time I got all the parts I get home and take it apart and find that the rivit they use in the bail where the line goes around is the cheapest thing I have ever seen, its hollow and there is hardly any reinforcement, a toothpick is stronger. I am going to go an get some JB weld and hope I can fix it.  for $150 I expect more.  "
682349,misfish,2012-03-31 21:03:00,29133,    WHY?
682354,wormdunker,2012-03-31 21:21:00,1711,"Wow sounds like junk, I'd be returning that reel in a hurry!"
682356,misfish,2012-03-31 21:24:00,29133, Exactly
682361,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2012-03-31 21:32:00,0,trade it in for a shimano.
682362,davey buoy,2012-03-31 21:33:00,5505,"You wouldn't expect that to happen on a $29.00 reel,take it back and fight for something else equivalent.Talk to a manager.That's the least you can do."
682363,coreyhkh,2012-03-31 21:34:00,163,"its over a year old though, will they still take it back."
682364,davey buoy,2012-03-31 21:37:00,5505, Raise a bit of a stink and see what happens?
682372,danbouck,2012-03-31 21:49:00,4380,Speak with pflueger again. They will make it right
682377,buckster,2012-03-31 21:55:00,530,I'm with the doc on this one!
682384,ecmilley,2012-03-31 22:17:00,2163,x3 on the shimano reel or a diawa
682398,bigugli,2012-03-31 23:14:00,6138,"Shimano does not have immunity from producing lemons. I've seen a lot of stradics fall apart in under a year as well.  I guess the problem is simply one of cutting costs as popularity and demand rise. As Pfleugers are now very popular, increased production usually results in less QC monitoring.  Same thing happened to Mitchell.  Great reel until they moved production to the Pacific. They've produced nothing but disposable crap ever since."
682408,salmon,2012-03-31 23:58:00,334,Ditto Have the Flooger Supreme XT the newest one. So i bought for this year two CI4 2500 and a Stradic FJ2500  jose
682410,MCTFisher9120,2012-04-01 00:07:00,3761," Shimano  Ahh, don't think I've seen a bail fly off a reel yet. Daiwa makes a fine product too."
682420,Jacob,2012-04-01 00:43:00,186,"Another for the Shimano, you can't go wrong with Shimano, they're some if the best reels out there."
682421,Sinker,2012-04-01 00:53:00,8692,"I have a pretty good fleet of pfleugers, and haven't had a single issue. They get use A LOT too. I've even used them in salt water with no problems. I think you got a lemon!  They aren't shimano or diawa quality, but they're pretty damn good for the price!  S."
682425,coreyhkh,2012-04-01 01:14:00,163,I will stop at basspro on my way home next weekend and see if they will replace it. Next time I buy a high end reel it will be Shimano.  I will let you guys no what happens.
682431,BillM,2012-04-01 01:36:00,17367, This.
682479,solopaddler,2012-04-01 12:13:00,8605,"Comments on a particular product are always appreciated, but only if you've used that particular product.  What's the point in slagging a company when you have zero first hand experience?  I've used mostly Shimano my entire life but have started to stray towards Pflueger recently.  What I find amazing about the issue the op described, one of the things Pflueger is known for even on its lower end reels, is a superior bail mechanism.  It's beefier and more substantial than any Shimano product.  I have to admit I'm dissapointed to read this thread as I'm currently fishing several Pflueger Supreme XT's.  So far so good for me. I still maintain that for under $100 they can't be touched.  Time will tell.  I'll have a way better idea one year from now regarding durability."
682484,Terry,2012-04-01 12:25:00,14456,I have a pflueger patriarch and I am very happy with it I like it better then my SHIMANO CI4 1000..which I have no complains ..but the pflueger is a little nicer...IMO every company can make a bad batch
682491,asdve23rveavwa,2012-04-01 13:01:00,2690,"Five Pflueger in our home, one Supreme, two Arbors, one President and,  one Asaro. Never had a problem with any of them. I, also, used to be almost strictly Shimano. Still Love their product, but, not exclusively anymore. Like others have stated every company can make a lemon."
682497,12footspringbok,2012-04-01 13:11:00,459,Just when I was thinking of staying from shimano as well. It is possible a bad batch got produced though...  Thatnks for the heads up Corey
682538,jeffw,2012-04-01 14:35:00,267,you should take a look at the quantum reels. I have afew quantum reels and have never had any problems. The smoke and energy reels are around that price point. Cheers Jeff
682544,Sebastian,2012-04-01 14:41:00,208, X2. Flueger President for 3 years of heavy use for salmon and bows with no problems. As smooth as my old JAPANESE stradic. No problem paying $60 for that. Dont see a point in paying $200 for a Malaysian stradic.
682563,kickingfrog,2012-04-01 15:07:00,8333,For those whom it matters to: Pfluger Supreme XTs are made in China.
