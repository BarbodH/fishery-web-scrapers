682888,Moosebunk,2012-04-02 13:41:00,3970,"Slopeous said, ""take this here blue pill and into the Laketrix we will go.""    THE LAKETRIX.   What was it like?  Well, it was record setting!  Was like 10 kajillion degrees outside, blazing solar flares blinding our eyeses and of the two cups left in my truck, ONE was a free coffee winner post-rollage!  What could be better than sunburns and extra caffeine on this tuesday?  Biting lakers, THAT'S what!  Ya see, this was the dillio just nine days earlier... remember winter???    ... And the ice after a week on Ultra-Slim fast...    Crazy other-worldy conditions this March.  First day of spring 2012 and fishing from a boat.  Joey says, ""Whoa!""  The Bomber was warming up at the spa after a short chilled winter in the garage so, the WarCanoe was called into action.  Grant had spoken with fishing God's the night before and deemed we take a tour for ice-out troutcicles.  On route to the lake though, nowhere was ""ice-out"" yet...  In fact, when we arrived at Destination Fish I swear we were looking at the final minutes of meltage out on the pond.  Canoe launched we jiggled here and we jiggled there before rippin' up onto some flats we remembered held lakers.  They were there.  Didn't take Grant long.    The softwater season was officially - A-GO.  Few lure change ups for myself, I found one in the ""Bin O' Mostly Junk"" that seemed to work.    Checking water temps later so to add some insightful info into a future online report, I found that the lake was both cold... and wet.  Grant was busy bending his rod up on the wicked custom deck.  Local greasy-cruising lackjockeys honed in our baits.  It was all just a bonus... no really!  We don't care about catching fish, we just like being outside and boating alot together.        For the day all trout were hooked on light gear.  Grant's a 6lb old-school mono guy on his whippy-light bamboo sticks and I prefer the newer 8-pound superbraid to an invisible floro lead on the ultra-light IM24 high modulus stuff... ya know.  Actually, it's all so retro 2013 and not even cool as of an hour ago.  Casting around in shallower waters and actually plucking lakers out from the stalks of old dead weeds like they're hiding summer bass, that right there is a riot!  On clear flats you could see 'em swiznizzling about like bonefish on beaches.  Sometimes schooled and ready to race one another for any lure.  ""Pluck!""      OK... so a dozen lakers in a day and a few pop-offs.  Could be sucky by some peoples standards... I guess.  But for us bloody boogers, a quick rust polish and a pretty good start to the spring.  As always, Grant keeps me laughing all day except when we get seriously into fish or our plans to fish some more in the future.    LAKETRIX REDUX.   Had the better part of a day to spare before needing to share a dinner with family for me dad's 163rd Birthday Feast Extravaganza.  Grant went MIA... so solo that morning the Wirestone tires on my 99 Chemmy Sillyrado squeeled outta the driveway on route to Destination Fish.  Quick fueling at the Extramar and nearby Jim Mortons coffee shop, all engines were high-test when I launched my Gund boat tripped out with my trusty Yamana into the frigid laker waters.  Cooler start to the morning, THANK GOD I had my ClassPro coat and hat on, as well as my UndieArmor to save me from certain hypothermia and keep me hot on my fishing game.  Watching my Cummingnerd Sonar equipped with Navigational ""chips and salsa,"" I raced safely to my first stop.  Upon arrival, gripping my 6 1/2 foot U-L Palarus Shizmano spinning rod, equipped with an old but still awesome and rainbow shiney Quangum PT reel spooled up with the ever strong and faithful 8-pound WowerPRO line which is secured with some Berkwerkely Trizlene XT backing, I laid out a cast pretty much the same way I would had all these products been under any different name.  But of course, first toss actually put a fish into my Fabbrill mesh net.  It's how I roll... It's just impossible to label pure awesome!    Fish SAMOKED a Moznuri crank then I gotta a timer pick on my Pumix... that took 10 seconds plus one second for the smile and another second for the release.  Fish back in the water in 12 seconds, for those who can't keep up.  I shilt you snot, the next hour, six more lake trout just like the first but some better, came in the boat.  Some old buggahs rolled right all up in my grill in their inferior WimpCrapt pushed by it's noisy chuggy-buggy Slurpury motor... ""Purdy slow fishin today.  You ketchun' any ober here dis moaning?""  They ask.  ""Slaying 'em doods, total slayfest."" I reply.  ""Hey I got an idea that'll help you guys catch some fish too... why don't you park your boat in my boat and fish with my gear RIGHT here!  It'll save some space to cast on the lake.""  They didn't get it... Instead they blew tight donuts all around me on the troll.    In retrospect... the action was so on before they showed up and spooked the zone, I wished I hadn't wasted ANY time taking Pumix pics of the fish.  Probably coulda used my inner Ninja to assassinate a few extra lakers within those precious moments.  Especially under the stealth of Grennan florocarbon leads and a casting arm that could chuck a feather forty miles.  Pimp my guns.  JIZBAH!!!    PIGNIGGLEFACTO!!!    Bite going soft for about 15 seconds I switched up to a Safety Pin with a piece of Brown Shoe Lace off my Salalamon Kicks, and the hits just kept coming...  BOONATANG!!!    It was an all ""grey"" slay day brought to me by the WeatherWetnorks, a posse of IBoners texting me accurate up to the second tips, tactics and micro-pin-pointable actual fish locations and feeding moods down to the decimeter AND, a legion of Facebookers, Blog-Hitters and fishing forum loving anglers that give the most important tool of all, their unwavering love and support to go on fishing in this world.  Cause dangit (dude, dude) ... the fish and fun alone could never be enough!  Mooser's Count on the day... Five hours on the water for seven casts and eighteen fish... plus two Jim Morton's cookies, a Chipotle turkey and a Ham and Suisse sangwich, a litre of Cull-again water, some BIG CHEW, and sixer of Golson Molden...  AND THEN I hit up Daddy's B'day Feast dinner for a table sized piece of wienershnitzel, some gin and half a cheese cake.  PHAT!  Not kidding.  18 fish day!  Nothing huge but WoOoOoOo HoooooOOO!!!      LAKETRIX RELOADED.   Was either a glitch in the Laketrix or some sort of programming error as this day would see Slop's nutty buddy Huddy who I call Sluddy, join he and I in what would be another day of obliterating local lake trout populations on Destination Fish.  Laterish start to a colderish morn, the mist hung low dampening the early air.  And blah, blah, blah, that's enough ""imagery.""  On the lake things got started immediately.  Sneaking in on a fish-haunt, a pod of about eight lakers were spotted sniffing the shallow topside of a deep ledge.  I saw first and so got the lure quick-shot out in front of the schools direction.  Big fish of the bunch was also the fastest to race out and grab it.    Solid fish... evidence they DO exist in Destination Fish.  Grant was up shortly after catching something special of his own.  Chucking a jig over some weed-clump, out from the shadows ripped a rather impressive toothy.  Pike took some great runs especially.  Grant was using about a 4-foot light action icefishing rod and the pole was bent 180 on itself the whole time.  A chunk of a gut (on the fish) Grantzilla posed a happy-angler.  Magnifique brutha!!!    Nutty Buddy Huddy Sluddy thank GOD had previously shaved off his autrocious beard.  And because he had done so, he received a cameo.  Truth be told, most of the morning Hud's was in the hot seat, he was a real laker nabber out there.    Before a temporary low-pressure and fog rolled in for a time, the fishing was ""on da hook.""  The temps started to drop awhile but finally by mid afternoon the sun popped out strong to stabalize and we were back to seeing the odd laker roam shallow again.  Grant managed a goody at some point before this crap weather came in.  He tried the laker gun... and to good effect too.    Grant will be happy to hear me say this... but ""he doesn't get enough credit for being the guy who actually takes many of our days fishing photos.""  He's got the fish eye and knows the poses we so whorishly post on regular occassion.  Kudos to you photo-freak!  And way-to-go Maggie on your upside-down cake!  Hud's shows up with his and Grant's food for the day, water and cake.  HaHa!  Moving along we were now struggling to reach the boat's goal of twenty lakers for the day.  With the water calm and sun out, we found ourselves searching out a new long stretch of shoreline.  We would see a couple dozen in an hour and it was at times like looking into an aquarium.  BUT... 95% of visible lone fish weren't taking baits... we had to fish deeper and did.  To the tune of a few more lac troots.  We ended our day at 19 in the boat.      And a couple made it home for the table...  FOOD SHOT!!!    (insert beautiful senitiment here)  As many fish as we caught we laughed more.  I had butterflies and my smile stretched a mile.    LAKETRIX O'FISH-IT-TALLY REMASTERED.   This little thing called employment which oftens gets in the way of fun stuff plagued my life for a stretch.  Once turning back over from nights and enjoying a movie date with the kiddies though, it was game on again.  I messaged with a bud who committed to meeting up later in the day if I was to go ahead Saturday to the lake.  That was a very last minute plan and I gotta admit to being excited for having Chris as company in the boat.  Late morning out on the lake was gross.  Cold, windy, damp and suprisingly busy.  For the first two hours I struggled EVERYWHERE to get fish.  More than a few boats were concentrated in one area, but I couldn't bring myself to fish in that pack.  What fishing I had done preceeding this day would seem to be rather useless, although I wanted to stick it out and be sure the pattern was done with before stopping for lunch and picking up Chris.  After awhile, other boats really started spreading out too and so it was a pretty good sign that it was search mode for all.  I picked up one little dinker for two hours effort and saw three other lakers only.  All the same water as before seemed pretty void of life.  The cold front had the fish resting down deeper.  When Chris was finally aboard that afternoon we took off to hit new waters.  Rejuvenated after warming up and having a bite to eat, with his energy in the boat it felt like a new day.  We started off fishing a little deeper and I slowed things down... sometimes just draggin' baits on soft bottom.  It worked, as it was just weight that was found to be on the end of the line for this first picture worthy fish that came second on the day.    Fish no sooner released and I picked up another quicky that hit the well for my supper.  Then caught another to be released.  Casting into the breeze again and slow jiggin' back to the boat I set the hook into some weight.  Turned out to be a good fish this one, I got it shallower and could see it below.  In perfect laker fashion it dogged as deep as it could and gave plenty peel and shake, again on the light gear it was awesome feeling it's every move.  Chris slid the net under it and howled, ""great fish, what a beauty!""  Indeed it was.  ""Laketrix"" FISH # 54.  A real gem lake trout for this lake and I guess one of those kicker-fish you're always after each time out.  It made my day and then some!    In the time it took to hook, play, unhook, wash the fish, take two photos and release the fish, two boats came roaring in and parked on my face while some doods in another raced over as well.  Guess we all shut'er down then.  Nobody moved rods so we took off elsewhere and watched from afar as even they dismantled themselves from the spot in short time too.  No more joking around this post, the afternoon was absolutely my pleasure having Chris aboard.  I picked up a couple more lakers in some new areas but the fishing remained slow.  We struggled but parted ways at the end of the day with hopes to fish again soon.   The four March Laketrix outings over the past couple weeks I could say have been an absolute blast with loads of fish.  56 to be exact.  CHICAPOW!  Unbelievable weather at times, cool light gear fishing on the softwater, and to be boating with buddies this early in the season is one rare treat.  Probably take in a little more of it, maybe onto something new... the season is still waaaaaay fresh but I'm officially high on tugs!"
