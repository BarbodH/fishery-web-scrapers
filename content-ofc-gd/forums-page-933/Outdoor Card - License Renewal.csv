275565,ctdd2006,2008-12-04 22:43:00,531,...and I renewed online last year on January 1st in the wee hours of the morning no less si I would be legit for the opener (nothing like waiting till the last minute)and have been fishing with a temporary card I printed off ever since.  I've also called twice for a new one!  Maybe one of those postal workers you're referring to are fishing with my card! lol Just kidding!
