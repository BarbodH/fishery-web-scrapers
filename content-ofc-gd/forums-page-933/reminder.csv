271028,walleyejigger,2008-11-23 16:59:00,876,"Just a heads up to those like me who's outdoors card expires at the the end of this year, time to get renewed,  just did it online and  actually managed to print out the ""e licence"" this time, site says it may take up to 20 days to get a new card, so i SHOULD have some wiggle room before the new year  $142.50 ouch"
271031,irishfield,2008-11-23 17:06:00,26272,Sure hope you have hunting tags as well... as a 3 years Sport + card is only $81.75.  Just did my youngest daughters last night.. manually.. as anyone with an apostrophy in their last name can't use the online without getting a syntax error.
271043,Beats,2008-11-23 17:24:00,543,Thanks for the reminder.  My 3 year card is done at the end of the year.  Just renewed for another 3.
271153,Greencoachdog,2008-11-23 23:29:00,8163,Yup! Thanks for the reminder... oh wait!... I have a lifetime license... nevermind.
271295,gone_fishin,2008-11-24 05:35:00,481,just did mine last night! it was only $81.75 though... not sure what you got...
271350,walleyejigger,2008-11-24 15:58:00,876,"yes i've got the 3 year fishing with the 3 year small game,  Irish, too bad  they won't tweak  the system for something so simple as an apostrophy, guess they're just lazy   GCD, as much as a lifetime  licence sounds good i'm not ready to get to the point where i'm eligible for that perk yet, LOL i guess paying isn't so bad"
271369,Greencoachdog,2008-11-24 16:41:00,8163,"I gave $100 in 1989 for a lifetime Alabama fishing license, I've been fishing on it for ""free"" for the past 8 yrs. and have 12 more years of free fishing left.  The state of Alabama started requiring a saltwater fishing license in 1993, since I bought my lifetime freshwater fishing license before that date I was ""grandfathered"" in on a lifetime saltwater fishing license at no extra charge."
271409,tonyb,2008-11-24 17:59:00,1637,"  I wish they had that here in ON!  Or at least the option to buy more than 3 years in advance.  Oh wait, but then they couldn't jack the prices at any moments notice"
271694,Jason B,2008-11-25 14:13:00,15,I recieved my renewal papers but i still don't have my card!  What the hell?

275556,Dano,2008-12-04 21:48:00,719,"Thanks for the reminder.    GCD, you know when you are going to die?"
275564,Beats,2008-12-04 22:39:00,543,"  Yeah, I just opened mine in the mail.. Same old card.  Not that I ever take it out of my wallet to enjoy the artwork anyway."
