274626,Clampet,2008-12-02 21:06:00,1947,There isn't a woman in the entire world that will ever make ole Jed visit any dog house. 
274630,solopaddler,2008-12-02 21:16:00,8605,So does this mean new snow tires for Christmas is a bad idea?
274633,misfish,2008-12-02 21:20:00,29133, 
274639,Dano,2008-12-02 21:30:00,719,"Yea, but you see, you gotta have the stones to know what to say when she tells you to go in like a good boy....just say no like a man."
274649,Big Cliff,2008-12-02 21:46:00,6899,"Sorry, I have to go now and take that nice little Shark Cordless that I bought at CTC last night back before it's too late!"
274651,Stoty,2008-12-02 21:46:00,2910,"Well...if it makes you feel any better, mine might be getting a divorce!"
274661,holdfast,2008-12-02 22:04:00,1813,"That is absolutely Hilarious, even funnier than the three Amigos in Ottawa"
274663,crappieperchhunter,2008-12-02 22:10:00,2582,Now that's just plain nasty. Never been in the dog house. But I could tell you all some real scary stuff about sleeping on the couch     Sniff....your thoughtfulness brought a tear to my eye Cliff. Don't you dare return it. Sue would be overjoyed.

274667,Greencoachdog,2008-12-02 22:16:00,8163,"I'm not sure what to do with the liposuction, botox, and hot wax gift certificates now... I guess I could use them on myself.   ... hey Snag!... wanna swap Brazilian pics?"
274671,crappieperchhunter,2008-12-02 22:21:00,2582,Now that's funny right there. Very disturbing...but funny
274672,DRIFTER_016,2008-12-02 22:26:00,10439,  New snow tires are a great idea. It shows how much you care for her and the kids safety. Now a new vaccume cleaner............................................probably not so good.
274677,Roy,2008-12-02 22:31:00,13728,"And if she ever tells you that she wants something parked in the driveway that'll do 0-200 in 2 seconds flat, don't, I repeat DON'T wrap her bathroom scale and leave it in the driveway for her to find. There is no probation, no appeal....you're a lifer, Dude."
274682,Big Cliff,2008-12-02 22:54:00,6899,"Lifer????? I'd be dead on the spot. Heck, last time I ticked Sue off I didn't see her for 4 days.   By the fifth day the swelling in my eyes had started to go down and I could make out some shapes and figures!"
274683,Bernie,2008-12-02 22:58:00,3190," As much as it is supposed to be ""the thought that counts"" . This will still put you in the doghouse Drifter. But there may be room for an appeal  ."
274685,Joey,2008-12-02 23:01:00,9122,Put a bright shiny piece of jewellery in the middle of the tires and you're good as gold  Joey
274691,douG,2008-12-02 23:16:00,2693,"Ooooooooooooohhhhhhhhh, Shiny!"
274715,solopaddler,2008-12-03 00:14:00,8605," Great idea!, I was actually thinking new chrome rims would be pretty sweet as well."
274725,bigugli,2008-12-03 00:21:00,6138,I've sent the wife to the doghouse. Went to Bingo and didn't come home til the next morning. Made her squirm for 4 days.  Payback's a _____!
275140,Bernie,2008-12-03 23:15:00,3190,A guy ended up in the doghouse over this project. 
275165,Clampet,2008-12-03 23:45:00,1947, 
275169,irishfield,2008-12-03 23:52:00,26272,I did not end up in the dog house Bernie.... but it sure hurt when she pulled that ladder out from under me!
