274110,Hawg Hunter,2008-12-01 19:52:00,204,hey all just wondering what heater you use in your ice hut i use Mr.Heaters  Hawg Hunter
274130,huntervasili,2008-12-01 20:31:00,1604,I have a portable mr buddy with a 5lb tank... works great for a weekend of fishing in my hut.
274145,wuchikubo,2008-12-01 20:48:00,1114,Mr. Heater portable Buddy. Awesome little heater.
274170,irishfield,2008-12-01 22:00:00,26272,"I have the little sport cat to take the chill off... but just bought the big 12,000 BTU infra-red burner CTC had on sale last week so I can do the lunch heating... since Ronnie won't join us this Feb in Temagami. (and he usually runs the take-out facility ! lol)"
274173,Terry,2008-12-01 22:04:00,14456,oh yeah that's a problem.....LOL I use a Mr. Heater portable Buddy
274177,misfish,2008-12-01 22:09:00,29133," Sure does make them peanut butter sandwiches toasty eh Terry.  Those that want to buy one of the buddies,keep yer eyes open at Princess auto. Im sure they will be there on sale soon."
274178,misfish,2008-12-01 22:12:00,29133,"Any older Ma Bell workers here? You guys remember them heaters you guys used? The ones with the four burners in them? Those made great heaters in the hut,but man the fumes that came from them."
274251,bigugli,2008-12-02 00:54:00,6138,Bio-thermal gas heat   The more beans the better
274282,sonny,2008-12-02 02:07:00,511,"I don't think you can beat the buddy heaters made by mr heater,,,i have a big buddy heater myself!!"
274290,Rich,2008-12-02 02:17:00,3927,The heat from my lighter.. sheesh I wish I had a hut let alone a heater to put in it. lol
274292,Fang,2008-12-02 02:18:00,1330,I have a Coleman Black Cat that works great but would rather take out a single burner stove with me now. I have a Coleman Powerpack single burner that uses the 1 lb bottles.  Burns with twice the BTU's and cost way less than a Black Cat. 1 bottle still last a full day  When the fish aren't biting at least i can cook up some soup of even fry up some moose sausage.  Go with a single burner you won't regret it
274296,sonny,2008-12-02 02:22:00,511,"Fang,,,it also has to do with the carbon monoxide that an open flame gives off,,,catalyst heaters are safe for close quaters!"
274305,brkygetr,2008-12-02 02:32:00,425,this one.... 
274323,Mike the Pike,2008-12-02 03:11:00,3421,"Coleman Black Cat ,compact and does a fine job.  "
274610,Ramble,2008-12-02 20:35:00,713,Hut? Heater? Are you guys getting soft or what here?? LMAO  INTERNAL COMBUSTION. i can go quite a while on bacon eggs and orange juice lol  -R-
274624,BUSTER,2008-12-02 21:04:00,1336,ahh that'll change with age.....
274731,PERCHER,2008-12-03 00:34:00,787,Mr Buddy .It's an awesome heater .For 89.99 you cant beat them.I use a 5lb tank on mine and can get about 4-5 days out of it.
274752,DRIFTER_016,2008-12-03 01:07:00,10439,"Yeah, we use Mr. Heaters up North too!!!! One of these and a 100 pound tank and you're good for the whole day!!!  "
274778,skeeter,2008-12-03 01:49:00,1907,  this is mine and it works great. it heats the hut and cooks food reheats coffee really nice
274801,Muskieman,2008-12-03 02:35:00,2472,Doesn't anybody burn wood anymore?......Where's all the Buckers??  Wood stove for me!!  Gets pretty WARM in there!  But I must admit that it's a pain to bring wood to the shack every time you drive across the lake....It's a little more of a pain in the     than propane..    RFS
274810,jwl,2008-12-03 02:57:00,1056,"at my trailer,me and a good buddy up there, when we get together for some ice fishin we take a couple approaches to it...we either just go drill a few holes, set up rods and sit out on the ice until we get too cold if it's brutal out, then we head up on my patio and put as big toasty fire in the pit..warm up, watch the lines and see who gets one.   Out on the ice we use a small metal garbage can type deal, my buddy put casters on the bottom, we wheel it out and start the fire with one of those ""firelogs"" you can buy then keep it going with small pieces of wood all day...on a really cold day we will put up some poles and tarps for a windbreak....sit by the garbage can fire, and sip some ""special coffee""    So there you go..someone else who uses wood to keep warm"
