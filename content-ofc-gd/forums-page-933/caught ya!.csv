274402,snag,2008-12-02 05:50:00,1932,Great shot!  Both look healthy.  O.k. one looks hurtin'
274450,Beats,2008-12-02 12:46:00,543,This is from a trail cam?  Or you took the shot yourself?
274518,BassAsin,2008-12-02 16:24:00,806,"took the shot myself, unfortunatley i dont have a trail cam yet. hopefully santa pulls through on that"
274526,TJQ,2008-12-02 16:54:00,7806,Thats an awesome picture!!!
274527,Dozer,2008-12-02 16:54:00,896,Look at the beautiful winter coat... did you see him catch it or was he just crossing paths with you?
274529,waterwolf,2008-12-02 17:11:00,556," do your homework regarding the trail cam. i have a moultrie with a flash. got back some night  photos of coyotes, deer even bunnies running from the camera. the daytime pic's are fine but low-light shots seem to alarm some animals with the flash."
274537,BassAsin,2008-12-02 17:45:00,806,"was actually out looking for a big 12 point buck i had seen a week before on the roadside near some property i have permission to be on so i took the camera because there is no bow season on that side of the highway, heard the partdridge clucking and putting so i was sneaking in for a photo when i realized why he was so noisy. the fox had it in its mouth shaking it like a dog with a ball."
274539,BassAsin,2008-12-02 17:48:00,806,father lives in pembroke he has 2 bushnell's and a moultrie have had little problems with the flash bothering game until this year. had a buck in the area we knew of and he wasnt too photogenic although his wife and kids were all over the camera a whopping 173 pics of them in 3 hours and one of a big buck
274542,irishfield,2008-12-02 17:51:00,26272,Great shot of a real healthy fox.
