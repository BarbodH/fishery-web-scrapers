274846,Kerry,2008-12-03 04:02:00,383,"Hey, I just noticed you don't have to double click to go back a page on IE.Musta just happened cause I jumped over to firefox yesterday when it did it to me.Good Job guys! Kerry"
274848,irishfield,2008-12-03 04:04:00,26272,Depends what background you're using... still double clicking on the blue/white default background..as well as the club background and it gets annoying.
274850,Beats,2008-12-03 04:15:00,543,I've had a Microsoft mouse for a few years now with back/forward buttons on the side where the thumb rests.  No going back to the old way for me.  THis is the way to do it.  So much faster then having to click on back/forward all the time.
274857,bigfish1965,2008-12-03 04:34:00,3382," this skin and the club skin are coded the same. IE has issues with iframes but unless MS fixes that, theres nothing I can do. The trouble  is the technology in this board is newer and ahead of IE, but like beats says, prgramming a back button on a mouse works wonders."
274869,GBW,2008-12-03 04:59:00,8460,"the browser ""safari"" works well too.  Oh and I like the new Christmas look as well"
275186,Kerry,2008-12-04 00:27:00,383,I've been using the driftwood theme when I'm logged on since the board was redone this way and I'm not sure what the skin is when you're not logged on but I had to double click  back on both themes up until yesterday.Somebody's done somethin' cause it's all good at my end now. Kerry
275319,Stern Rules,2008-12-04 06:19:00,342,I just noticed too. It was annoying the hell out of me.
275352,hawkeye,2008-12-04 13:03:00,162,"I just noticed that it was gone too, annoying little bugger. I didn’t change anything on my PC and I just tried it from my laptop and it’s gone from there too.  Good riddance if you ask me"
275606,walleyejigger,2008-12-05 00:05:00,876,"thank god, if it's a problem with IE and the other skin, i hope we keep this skin all year long"
