One more question, with Petro park being closed, where can you park to fish lower Bronte this time of year?  Thanks everyone!"
275501,babaganoush,2008-12-04 18:53:00,105,"not sure about credit but bronte was flowing and a little dirty. should be good by the weekend as for parking, you can park at the car pool lot at the qew and walk down to the river"
275544,rock34,2008-12-04 21:02:00,215,"Thanks man.  I was told that the fishing was really slow in these rivers this year.  I wonder why and I hope that is not a sign of things to come.  I almost dont believe that it has been as poor as I have been told, which is why I ask.  Huron Tribs have treated me well lately but I was thinking about heading to a Lake O trib at some point for a change of scenery.  If nobody has a report on these rivers though I think I will stick to where I have been as it is a bit of a long drive when there are no fish around.  Thanks again!"

275555,highdrifter,2008-12-04 21:38:00,2534,"Prolly a coupla fish kicking around...  I'm told water levels have been down this year.  We were doing well towards the end of October, when the salmon were still in..  Now that the salmon are gone..  I dunno!  Funny thing, they seem to have all but vanished!!  Anybody else experience this?  HD"
275574,babaganoush,2008-12-04 23:07:00,105,"the carpool lot is still there, its just to the upper left portion the fishing at bronte has been ok, its all timing with that river as there have been runs of fish coming in but are gone the second there is water which is good to see. good luck if you go ill be there in the morning"
