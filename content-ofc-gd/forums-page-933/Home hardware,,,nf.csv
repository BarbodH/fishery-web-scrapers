274281,Bernie,2008-12-02 02:04:00,3190,"Yep. I hear you Sonny. Went into Home Depot on Saturday to get some blades for my Makita hand planer. To my surprise a co-worker from years back was working the tools department. He chuckled a bit when I asked for the blades. ""They only sell the tool not the parts"" he says. I thought when the Home Depot first came to town it would be my favorite store. Needless to say it certainly hasn't met my expectations. Our small town hardware store recently switched from a Pro hardware to a Home Hardware. It depends a lot on the owner of the store and what/how they stock it to please the local community."

274287,brkygetr,2008-12-02 02:15:00,425,As i understand it Home Hardware is the biggest supplier of lumber Canada wide. I read an article on this years ago. If you think about it it makes sense...theres a lot more Home Hardwares in small towns then a Home Depot....by the way i think they originated out of St. Jacobs Ontario. They do have what you want.
274444,Jer,2008-12-02 12:41:00,1426,I love our Home Hardware store in Bridgenorth.  Very rarely can I not find what I'm looking for...
274449,OhioFisherman,2008-12-02 12:45:00,6623,"That is the problem with a lot of the big box stores, they only stock what they want to sell you, what generates the most profits for them. The mom and pop smaller stores may actually have what you want or need."
274463,joonmoon,2008-12-02 13:06:00,528,Home Hardware is a small town store gone Canada wide to all the smalltowns. And yes they originated in St. Jacobs'. I try to spend more money there than the big box stores because not only were they here first they are Canadian businesses. They always have what you need or they will get it for you. Their prices are very comparable and well I'm just glad they're here.
274464,bigugli,2008-12-02 13:06:00,6138,"Gotta love Kala's in St. Kitts. ""If we don't got it  we'll find it"", is an attitude that goes a long way with me as a customer."
274472,Beans,2008-12-02 13:50:00,3339,The owner of Home Hardware in Bobcaygeon is an avid fisherman...  Always nice to go there for stuff and shoot the breeze with Roger...
274503,shane,2008-12-02 15:31:00,652,"Home Hardware is my 'go-to' spot for all my hardware needs.  The guys at my local store (Summer's HH on Hamilton rd. here in London) actually fixed a 50 year old, discontinued plumbing part for me instead of selling me a new fixture.  Two guys on the counter with vice-grips and hacksaw, and then only charged me for a new washer. "
274511,LeXXington,2008-12-02 15:49:00,1928,"I say its all about the owner., HH has some great stuff and in a small town they are the life blood."
