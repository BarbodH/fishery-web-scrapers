Does anyone know of a Bootle your own or a freind that has a batch ready that there not going to use?  I know there use to be a bottle and cork at the Weston Lcbo but i cant find out any info on the net.  And if there is any left after my company leaves it will be used on the ice ...just to toast the first fish of the year or the biggest catch of the day or if the suns out.....  Thanks  Rp"

274506,fishing n autograph,2008-12-02 15:41:00,2540,"most DIY places have their own bottles pre bottled and ready to serve....or just go to the LCBO, you can get Pelee Island wine for around $7 it's good stuff"
274514,ketchenany,2008-12-02 15:57:00,3229,Magnotta winery has wine in a box in various price ranges and very good too.   www.magnotta.com
274516,raysfish2005,2008-12-02 16:19:00,163,Thanks guys but i need min 60 bottles....can you say lush!
274520,Fang,2008-12-02 16:27:00,1330,"I'll second the Magnotta trip RF. There not a better bottle of wine for under $6 than their French blend white or red. Many of their wines are also sold by case lots.  There's a Magnotta store right at Dixie and Dundas. South on Dixie, 1 block from Dundas on the East side.  The Trionfo red is very nice as well as the Incanto White. My favs right now  I started drinking the Magnotta wines after several very bad experiences with vintages at the LCBO that came highly recommended. I may not have the refined tastebuds for the expensive stuff so all I care about is whether I like it not the $."
274525,ketchenany,2008-12-02 16:52:00,3229,The Magnotta house wine blends in a box ($79.95 16 L) range from $3.14 to $3.84 per bottle.
