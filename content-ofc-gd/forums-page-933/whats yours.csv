274391,ctdd2006,2008-12-02 05:36:00,531,....you visit...do call.  Can guide.......free!  or for a beer maybe!
274521,BassAsin,2008-12-02 16:32:00,806,always say for beer.
274547,Leecher,2008-12-02 18:02:00,7832," Cudz, bass is open til the end of March on the QC side.... a lot of fun to catch  "
274643,Cudz,2008-12-02 21:37:00,2652,Very cool. Why is it that we never catch smallies by accident on Simcoe in the winter?  Maybe people do but I have never seen it.  Would be interesting to hear if people do.  They must.
274666,misfish,2008-12-02 22:15:00,29133," Never caught a smallie through Simcoe ice,but nailed some nice buckets on Little lake while trying for eyes and crappies."
274676,Ramble,2008-12-02 22:31:00,713,"Specks/Splake are both beautiful fish and usually come with some really nice scenery. Pulling a few through the hole always strickes a cord with me.  Perch/Crappie are next on the list. Getting into a few schools of these bad boys in a day always puts a smile on my face and leaves me satisfied.  Lakers are fun, when i can find some to cooperate. Another beautiful fish accompanied by great scenery.  Walleye are a good time as well, but i'd rather catch 10 perch then 1 'eye. I see enough in the summer anyway.  Pike i don't target in the winter, and I don't miss them.  Last year we ended up with some really nice bass fishing for walleye on a weedline. They were a riot through the ice. Too bad we can't target them...but you can't stop them from biting when they do!  I've never caught a whitie through the ice before, but this might be the year. I have plans with a friend to specifically go chasing them on Simcoe this winter at least once.....here's hoping!  -R-"
274678,misfish,2008-12-02 22:35:00,29133," I target them after everything else is closed on simcoe,whities and lakers.Well except perch and crappies. There was a time when we would get some real pigs,but the changing of the structure here in the bay, seems to have moved them along. You can still get them,but nothing like years before."
274690,Cudz,2008-12-02 23:14:00,2652,"Yeah I remember there being more pike in the bay and catching them not too far from what is now the South Shore Center.  Having said that we caught a 32"" 3 summers ago trolling 15ft down in 25 ft of water."
274692,misfish,2008-12-02 23:19:00,29133," I was talking about the otherside of the bay,,,,,,,,,what is now hooters Bay.LOL  You can find me there after the 15th of March til the end."
274895,Cudz,2008-12-03 07:04:00,2652,"Yeah I know what you mean.  That was a regular pike spot.  In front of the old Beatrice plant.  I have never caught a pike there.  Tons of perch.  Several smallies, rock bass etc.  Never a pike.  Go figure.  I fished there last winter for perch and did quite well."
275074,Pondo,2008-12-03 20:26:00,36,LING!
275088,PERCHER,2008-12-03 21:20:00,787,I would have to say Perch.Hence the name PERCHER.Come summer I might have to change it to salmon slammer if we make the top ten again. Dan
273843,Hawg Hunter,2008-12-01 02:33:00,204,seeing as the ice fishing season is almost upon us i thought id ask what is your favorite fish to catch during the hardwater season as you may have guessed im 100% walleye.  WHATS YOUR FAVORITE  Hawg Hunter
273844,BUSTER,2008-12-01 02:35:00,1336,nothing like a day of perch with the kids
273846,pike slayer,2008-12-01 02:37:00,1177,lakers are my favorite fish to catch in the winter and as you can see pike in the summer
273848,DRIFTER_016,2008-12-01 02:40:00,10439,Lakers.
273850,irishfield,2008-12-01 02:46:00,26272,Yep.. can't beat a 19 lb laker pulling out 10lb line! lol
273852,Leecher,2008-12-01 02:48:00,7832,"Walleye, pike and bass for me"
273855,tnt,2008-12-01 02:57:00,63,I'm not too picky....whatever I catch I like
273857,trapshooter,2008-12-01 02:58:00,1234,"walleyes, specs and lakers."

273897,bigugli,2008-12-01 03:32:00,6138,Whatever is biting and where.
273901,Grimace,2008-12-01 03:37:00,2020,Lakers and Walleye.
274317,waterwolf,2008-12-02 02:59:00,556,"watchin' a big hit on the ice from an aggressive pike is always a rush. they fight hard and make for some great photos once they're  winded. pretty beasts they are. if you're on a a lake with a decent population ,, winter pike make for some excellent table fare.     my fav. ,, no question."
274354,bigugli,2008-12-02 03:50:00,6138,"Got to admit, big pike through the ice are a blast.  Then again I feel like a kid let loose in a candy store when I go jigging for smelts."
274357,rickster,2008-12-02 03:51:00,495,wallys lakers crappie
274359,kemper,2008-12-02 03:52:00,2232,"  Agreed.  Most hardwater guys are hoping for thick ice. I hope its thin, it takes alot less work to bash through 1 inch ice over a 50 foot pool than it does to bash through 2 inches."
274365,waterwolf,2008-12-02 04:09:00,556,"kemper ,, you're bang on . thick ice is pain in the ,,,, auger . 2 to 3 in's of ice is perfect.   i travel light ,don't need that arctic ice thanks. early and late ice is the peak period anyway."
274367,waterwolf,2008-12-02 04:15:00,556,"brave or crazy?? ,, or maybe lazy?? still out there either way."
274378,Cudz,2008-12-02 05:09:00,2652,Bass????
274379,BassAsin,2008-12-02 05:16:00,806,"i have to say squaretails a good ole' speck, but then i again most of the specs i catch under the hardwater are in the 1 -5 lb range, gettin to these lakes is the fun part. and i must say i'm not happy with the 08-09 regs being in zone 11 specks dont open until feb 15th and only one over 12 inches."
274384,ctdd2006,2008-12-02 05:25:00,531,square tails too!  Only because most people around my parts prefer targetting the easier greasy lakers and the speck lakes/ponds are usually unmollested!
