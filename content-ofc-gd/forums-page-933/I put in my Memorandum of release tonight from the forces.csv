As you may know I had rejoined the forces in Order to help the next generation of Soldiers.  This involved Tuesday nights and so far 90% of my weekends on a minimum wage salary of which I still haven't been paid.  Tonight I gave notice to my Commanding Officer that I may terminate my service to this Country possibly in the new year.  He doesn't have to know this, but I am truly disgusted on the situation of our so called leaders that have made a mockery of me or anyone else that serves.  I cannot and will not serve politicians that are either Separatists, A citizen of France that the people have already voted against, and a Power seeking Union Socialist, who would make us soldiers look like Cowards in the face of the Enemy.  I apologize to all those pers that I criticized for not voting at the last election.  My Public Apology again to ChrisS.  I am disgusted at the thought of backroom deals with Separatists.  My meagre pay can go back to the Block Lovers or a Stimulation Package to the Auto Industry or Dead Forestry.  I am going to lower my Canadian Flag in Big River and raise the Saskatchewan Flag.  If and when I do get released, I will be forced to allie with the Western Separatist Party, which is now gaining momentum, because this is the Canada I never voted for or want.  Am disgusted to wear the Canadian Flag.  This my feeling as well as many of my peers that have been Loyal to you and this Country.  If any body sees Ralph Goodale, tell him the people of Saskatchewan want to talk to him!"

274884,forrest,2008-12-03 05:39:00,1032,Its just a little political storm....nothing much you or I can do about it.....tough it out.....it'll pass quicker if you don't get uptight about it.  As for payroll not getting you up and going...well my lips are sealed.  forrest
274886,danbo,2008-12-03 05:53:00,2646,CANADA..Love it or Leave it.  
274887,cram,2008-12-03 05:54:00,1733,i don't know if any part of canada wants this....assume everyone hates it as much as you do.  The politicians are just running a power play.  This is so undemocratic....it really pisses me off.

274916,Chris,2008-12-03 12:18:00,405," Thank you Rob. Too bad things have come to this in our country. They talk about Harper dividing the country.....but I think this is a very obvious example that shows who is really dividing this country (ie the three stooges). Unbelievable that there are still some diehard left-wing Canadians who actually feel it's a good idea to support this undemocratic mockery of Canadian governance (latest polls show 18% of Canadians support the coalition/82% do not). Legal or not, constitution or not....this is immoral, unecessary and an obvious power grab designed only for the benefit of the Liberals, NDP and Traitors. It's also an embarrassment on the world stage. Imagine a politician who had the lowest voter support for his party EVER and currently only 18% support is now going to run this country.  Only in Canada you say.....pity.  ps anyone out there still think their vote means anything??? I'd love to hear your answer now."
274920,Greencoachdog,2008-12-03 12:22:00,8163,... now may be the time your country needs you the most HF.
274922,Spiel,2008-12-03 12:28:00,9065,....Received this (petition) from a fellow OFC member this morning.
274924,lew,2008-12-03 12:29:00,12767," I never get involved in these political discussions Chris, but I've cast my last vote in this country, and that's all I'm gonna say about it.   And Holdfast, thanks for all your years of service to our country, but I can sure see where your coming from."
274936,Greencoachdog,2008-12-03 13:08:00,8163,... and now y'all know exactly how many of us felt down here after our election!  ... y'all practice up on your on-fron-say now... ya heah?
274940,pigeonfisher,2008-12-03 13:30:00,696,The difference here Glen is that the Obama got ELECTED.  The Canadian government is being overthrown from within.  The country did not vote for this to happen.
274942,Headhunter,2008-12-03 13:33:00,5703,"I gotta admit that I have watched your posts in the past, shook my head and carried on... but not this time. Your bang on Holdfast and anyone who agrees with Layton and his political pirates should move to Venezulea where they will be more at home. Thanks Holdfast! HH"
274945,Greencoachdog,2008-12-03 13:52:00,8163,"  My goodness, that's too bad.  ... well at least y'all will have someone to pick on now since anyone that picks on Obama will be considered a r........   Hey! Make y'all can petition the WOC to make politics bashing an Olympic sport?... like they're doing with pole dancing!"
274948,Pete Maina,2008-12-03 14:01:00,213,"Yikes. sounds like a bad deal going on.  Please excuse my ignorance of Canadian politics, but I am curious ... is there a short version of the story of what occurred?  Pete"
274951,TJQ,2008-12-03 14:09:00,7806,"Pete... yup....  we have a Conservative minority Government, Ie a government with out enough seats (members to control the house of Parliament (sorta like your congress)   so the other three political parties here, got together and between them all  they have more seats than the conservatives.... so they are banding together to try and outweigh the Conservatives.  Its all legal, BUT  one of the three parties is the Bloc Quebecquois, which is a party trying to seperate Quebec from the rest of the country, so in essence you would have a Political Party that wants to destroy the country shareing power with the governemnt and in effect swaying policy.  Anyway, I feel for ya Holdfast, you got your say out there... theres no where happy for this thread to go, so im gonna lock it.  We have alot of threads going awry this time of year, so were gonna try to ekkp it down to a dull roar in here, this is the time of year we loose members to the bickering..."
