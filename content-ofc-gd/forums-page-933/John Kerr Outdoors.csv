275443,snoil,2008-12-04 16:44:00,139,Due to economic reasons today is John Kerr's last column in the Sun. Sad i looked forward to reading it weekly.
275458,kingofthesteelhead,2008-12-04 17:26:00,140,John was an awesome steelheader in the 70's and eighties but I think the crowds drove him away. I see him usually in the spring at one of our perch hotspots as he is  quite a fanatic of panfish.
275465,crappieperchhunter,2008-12-04 17:32:00,2582, I think I know that perch spot   BTW shouldn't you be working  His column will be missed. Always enjoy reading his stuff.

275583,outdoorguy61,2008-12-04 23:26:00,220,Could this not be simply a reflection of his changing dutys with OOD and their recent sale to OFAH? It is sad to hear about the loss of another outdoor column. He did a solid job.  I think that there is likley the odd Diawa John Kerr signature series rod likley kicking around. Was there any other John Kerr series stuff?  outdoorguy61

If JK and his column were not generating enough advertising revenue, they replace him with someone else with an interest that might.  That rule of advertising should be transparently obvious to anyone reading the Sun, but it is true of all newspapers. Subscriptions do not pay the bills. Same rule for television, radio, and the internet."
