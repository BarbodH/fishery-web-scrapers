274338,waterwolf,2008-12-02 03:28:00,556,"hands down ,, no question!!  PIKE.   something that gets that big ,, fights that hard , and then when all the excitement's over , these fish are ruggedly beautiful. they make for great photos    also , if you're on a lake with a decent population , winter pike are damn tasty."
274341,danbo,2008-12-02 03:32:00,2646,Perch for the sheer #'s of hits!
274474,johnnyb,2008-12-02 13:57:00,3413," You got it, Cram...the drop off can be close to either deep or shallow...the important thing is a major depth change.  My ideal kind of spot is a point ,whether it's an island or from shore, that drops quickly...then you can pop a string of holes going out from shore, covering that drop. And yes, I'd love to come up if we can organize it   I'm only a pm away"

274589,johnnyb,2008-12-02 19:51:00,3413,"  When the herring season was open, what did you do with them?  Are they edible?  One of the smaller lakes I fish up north has a pretty good population, but I don't know what to do with 'em ,'cept let 'em go."
274598,misfish,2008-12-02 20:12:00,29133," Smoke them(in a smoker) kinda hard to light.LOL I would usually just scale them,split in half and add smoke flavor and salt and pepper and put under the broiler. They are oily,but very tastey.  I remember the days when we would head out and start jigg,n,  could just barely see the flash from the lure. Would get a bump,start to bring the lure up slowly and there would be 50 or so swimming around. The kids had a blast."
274599,Raf,2008-12-02 20:14:00,3495,yeah.. they are great in the smoker  good pike bait too.
274645,Dano,2008-12-02 21:44:00,719,"The herring or what I was told were herring, (some called them ciscoes) we caught in Nippissing were just chock full of worms."
274646,Rich,2008-12-02 21:45:00,3927,Pike!
274653,Governator,2008-12-02 21:47:00,879,"Well.. this will be my first winter ever ice fishing (Just started fishing this summer).  I've never cleaned a fish, but I'm definitely tempted to pull out some nice jumbos from simcoe and try cleaning them up for some tasty fish & chips.  Other than that, I'd probably target pike.  We'll see if I can take the cold lol."
274655,misfish,2008-12-02 21:51:00,29133," Not here. Very nice white clean meat. Yes they call them cisco, along as blue and black backs."
274662,misfish,2008-12-02 22:10:00,29133,
274689,Beats,2008-12-02 23:14:00,543,  Also called tullibees in some areas.  I've only seen them in Simcoe and only ever heard of them referred to as herring there.
274694,misfish,2008-12-02 23:27:00,29133,"Had to reread your post,Thought I read Tellatubbies.  Never knew that. But they taste nothing like cheese burgers.LOL   cheese burgers with fins"
274938,johnnyb,2008-12-03 13:22:00,3413,"I never knew they were also called Tullibies....interesting.  So, I either have to find a way to smoke 'em, or try a bit of gator pike action in the spring with 'em.  Thanks for the info    I don't think they'll become my favourite species through the ice...but...you never know..."
274010,Hawg Hunter,2008-12-01 15:53:00,204,hello all seeing how our hardwater season will soon be upon us id thought id ask this ?  whats your favorite fish to chase during the hardwater season.  you all know mines 100% walleye   Hawg Hunter

274029,bbog,2008-12-01 16:46:00,665,It would be walleye if I knew what I was doing :LOL
274032,johnnyb,2008-12-01 16:54:00,3413,I go for the lakers  but this year I am determined to pull my first walleye through the ice...and possibly some brookies too

274038,cram,2008-12-01 17:24:00,1733,"curious -- if you were goign to direct a beginner (at ice fishing, not fishing overall) what species would you send him/her after?  What is the easiest to catch (other than perch)?  I have lake trout and whitefish in my lake but zero experience going after them (deep in the summer).  Usually fish for pike/walleye/bass/musky......."
274050,buckster,2008-12-01 17:50:00,530,Simcoe whities and lakers all the way!
274053,Leecher,2008-12-01 17:56:00,7832,"Still walleye, pike and bass"
274054,irishfield,2008-12-01 17:56:00,26272,Dang... thought I was going nuts as I already posted to this thread Hawg.. then realized for some reason your started another one...  Lakers.... nothing like 19 lbs pulling out 10 lb line to warm you up when it's -25C !
274059,Leecher,2008-12-01 18:00:00,7832, Wayne had to same reaction as yours
274067,troutologist,2008-12-01 18:23:00,951,  Ditto. Maybe I'll run into you up there this winter.
274072,brkygetr,2008-12-01 18:27:00,425,Specks....go figure. Tastiest and most beautifull trout out there.
274080,LeXXington,2008-12-01 18:42:00,1928,Any fish that will make sitting on cold ICE exciting..  Only think I have managed to get on ICE is perch..  fish I want too catch on the ice ANYTHING ELSE but PERCH

274113,Hawg Hunter,2008-12-01 19:57:00,204,  ya me too sorry folks guess im too pumped up for the answers  Hawg Hunter
274135,Handlebarz,2008-12-01 20:37:00,3790,gotta be eyes or pike if we are in a good area for some big ones. I dont eat fis hso I like to chase the bigger ones. But anything is better then sitting at home watching the cold out there.
274156,anders,2008-12-01 21:16:00,1168," LOL  maybe!  i was going to ask you were you usually hit, but i know its an unwritten law(up here anyways) that you dont say where we are in the park.  LOL  Surprising enough, though i only bumped into 1 person from the Sault in all my time up there and that was on Gamitagama.  If we do see each other make sure the coffee pot is on!"
274158,johnnyb,2008-12-01 21:22:00,3413," I would have to say that Lakers would be your best bet...they're aggressive almost all winter long, and have no problem moving through all depths under the ice.  Find 60 feet of water, preferably close to a point/drop-off.  Drop a tip-up with 2 minnows on it -- one minnow within 2 feet of bottom, and the other no deeper than 15 feet.  At your other hole, drop a silver spoon -- Little Cleo, kastmaster, arrowhead, sidewinder, wabler, WHATEVER.  Jig it, with lots of pauses.  Work your way up, jigging at different depths.  If nothing hits it, drop a white tube jig, and do the same thing. If by now, you've caught nothing at either hole, move over a few hundred yards, and repeat  Heck, let's make this REAL easy...just tell me when to meet you at your place, and I'll show you what I mean"
274166,Ranger22,2008-12-01 21:39:00,18,Crappies hand down.
274175,Terry,2008-12-01 22:06:00,14456,I love doing walleyes but most times perch till we get good ice then whities and lakes
274183,misfish,2008-12-01 22:26:00,29133,"Whities first Crappies second Perch third( during the late ice).  Pickeral,when I can get them.  If they would open the herring season on Simcoe,that would be my number one."
274184,Dano,2008-12-01 22:28:00,719,"I love em all, but walleye and lakers are my favs."
274187,smbhunter,2008-12-01 22:36:00,186,Pike Walleye Lake trout Whitefish Not necessarily in that order.  I can never pass up an outing where specks are the main target. I really enjoy the whole speck fishing experience whether I catch any or not.
274201,cram,2008-12-01 23:08:00,1733, Thank you!! Very helpful.  60 feet iwth a drop-off to deeper water or shallower....or is the point just to get vertical structure for them to associate wtih?  If you're serious about coming up -- lets stay in touch over the winter
