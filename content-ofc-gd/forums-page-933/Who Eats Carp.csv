275307,Beats,2008-12-04 05:07:00,543,"  Again, I have no idea where you are trying to go with this.  I'm sorry it upsets you that people in general don't eat a lot of carp.  I have seen tons of carp caught in my life time and can completely honestly say that I have seen only 1 person ever keeping them.  I was just walking by and not fishing.  Not that that matters.  Your initial comment was very vague except that you showed your distaste for my post.. so you left my no choice but to assume you were implying I was being racist ... which I wasn't .  Don't play innocent.  I don't edit my posts, and stand by what was written.  THey are there for anyone to read and I won't change them.  I don't understand at all how you are reading that differently.  You seem to be basing your dislike of my post on assumptions that I am secretly seeing ppl eat carp all around me.. Well, I'm not.  Sorry.  Lastly, go eat a carp.  It was your suggestion.  Feel free to PM me further as I don't want to be the reason for a decent thread being shutdown based on your inability to read and re-read my posts without prejudice."
275308,The Urban Fisherman,2008-12-04 05:19:00,2050,"I fished carp pretty well exclusively for 2 years during college, and try to target them at least a few times a summer now, so I've got nothing against them...they put up a heck of a fight...but I'm here to tell ya,  I took my brother-in-law who was a chef out fishing for them last season and he took a smaller one home to try and cook up and it was absolutely repulsive....maybe he isn't a chef anymore for a reason    but man after smelling that thing being cleaned in my kitchen I couldn't even fish them for a good couple months! I've gotta be honest, after the smell of it being cleaned and cooked in my house, I couldn't bring myself to have a bite...he did and didn't have a second...that was enough for me!  I'll try to dig up the pictures we took - it looked tasty at least!  ps. it's a bummer that a fun thread like this had to go south on us...."
275309,Beats,2008-12-04 05:23:00,543,  No kidding.  I used to catch carp a whole lot as a small kid.  Lots of opportunities to find them since they are almost everywhere.  I used to catch them on just bread mostly.  Haven't targeted them myself in years but there are some monsters here in the Thames.

275316,Steelcat,2008-12-04 05:53:00,191,"My friend caught a carp last year and invited me to have a carp meal.  Here's the menu: Tofu Carp head soup  Deep fried Carp filet  Dry tofu something paste Carp  Steamed Carp in black bean sauce   To tell you the truth, as I recalled the soup taste fishy. I like the deep fried Carp filet mainly because I like deep fried filet. As for the Dry tofu something paste Carp and Steamed Carp in black bean sauce, the sauce actually were strong enough to ""cover"" the fishy smell.  Not bad."
275317,Stern Rules,2008-12-04 06:07:00,342,Some people eat suckers and they're supposed to be okay. I'd be more apt to eat a sucker than a carp but if done right I'd try it. Carp are supposed to have floating bones which turn off some people. Eels are kinda creepy but they are also supposed to be good and next summer I am gonna try one. So you shouldn't knock it until you try it. You just never know. You might be surprised.

The spring redhorse sucker run is amazing to, we got some monsters in there, pushing 24"" if I'm remembering correctly.  We tried cookin' them up to, they tasted fine, but the flesh was a little bit mushy and they were near impossible to ""de-bone"".  It wasn't until my third year of school that I got a bass on corn and soon discovered a fantastic smallie fishery, as well as pike and plenty of rockies..."

275344,Clampet,2008-12-04 12:49:00,1947," Here's another: http://www.elise.com/recipes/archives/0002...uillabaisse.php   Bouillabaisse Posted by Elise on Jan  2, 2004  Filed under Low Carb, Main Course, Seafood, Soup and Stew   Print Options  According to tradition, there should be at least five different kinds of fish in a proper bouillabaisse. In Marseille, considered the mecca of bouillabaisse, they use at least seven, not counting the shellfish. The fish should be extremely fresh - caught and cooked the same day. If you cannot get extremely fresh fish, then the next best alternative is quick frozen - fish frozen the same day it was caught. Use as many different types of fish as you can, such as fillets of flounder, haddock, cod, perch, white fish, whiting, porgies, bluefish, bass - almost any combination. Count on at least three kinds to serve six.   Bouillabaisse Recipe  Print Options   Ingredients Stew ingredients: 3 pounds of at least 3 different kinds of fish fillets, fresh or quick frozen (thaw first) 1/2 cup Olive oil 1-2 pounds of Oysters, clams, or mussels 1 cup cooked shrimp, crab, or lobster meat, or rock lobster tails 1 cup thinly sliced onions 4 Shallots, thinly sliced OR the white parts of 2 or 3 leeks, thinly sliced 2 cloves garlic, crushed 1 large tomato, chopped, or 1/2 cup canned tomatoes 1 sweet red pepper, chopped 4 stalks celery, thinly sliced 2-inch slice of fennel or 1 teaspoon of fennel seed 3 sprigs fresh thyme or 3/4 teaspoon dried thyme 1 bay leaf 2-3 whole cloves Zest of half an orange 1/2 teaspoon powdered saffron 2 teaspoons salt 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 1 cup clam juice or fish broth 2 Tbps lemon juice 2/3 cup white wine Sliced French bread   Method 1 Heat 1/4 cup of the olive oil in a large (6-qt) saucepan. When it is hot, add onions and shallots (or leeks). Sauté for a minute, then add crushed garlic (more or less to taste), and sweet red pepper. Add tomato, celery, and fennel. Stir the vegetables into the oil with a wooden sppon until well coated. Then add another 1/4 cup of olive oil, thyme, bay leaf, cloves and the orange zest. Cook until the onion is soft and golden but not brown.  2 Cut fish fillets into 2-inch pieces. Add the pieces of fish and 2 cups of water to the vegetable mixture. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer, uncovered, for about 10 minutes. Add oysters, clams or mussels (though these may be omitted if desired) and shrimp, crabmeat or lobster tails, cut into pieces or left whole.  3 Add saffron, salt, pepper. Add clam juice, lemon juice, and white wine. Bring to a simmer again and cook about 5 minutes longer.  4 At serving time taste and correct the seasoning of the broth, adding a little more salt or pepper if need be, and maybe a touch of lemon juice. Into each soup bowl place a thick slice of crusty French bread, plain or slighlty toasted. Sppon the bouillabaisse over the bread. If desired, serve with Sauce Rouille. Serves 6.  Directions for Sauce Rouille:  1 Tbsp hot fish stock or clam broth. 2 cloves peeled garlic 1 small red hot pepper 1/2 teaspoon salt 1/4 cup soft white bread, pulled into bits 1/2 cup olive oil  Put hot fish stock or clam broth into the bottom of a blender. Add garlic and red hot pepper, salt and bread. Blend until very smooth. With the blender still running, add olive oil slowly and stop the blending as soon as the oil disappears.  At serving time pass Rouille in a little bowl along with the bouillabaisse. Each serving is about 1/2 a teaspoon that you stir into your soup. Use gingerly like Tabasco."

The first time I saw carp in those livewells was at Kennsington Market in the '80s.  I was blown away that they were selling carp like they were trout or lobster!!!  In those days, my wife's parents used to call Kennsington the Jewish Market( because there were so many Jewish merchants there ).  Anhyhoo, I learned how carp was considered a delicacy by various ethnic groups and my impression of the fish for table-fare changed then and there.  On a side note.. as GCD and a few others said about corn... When my Parents immigrated from Yugoslavia and my Mom saw people in Canada eating corn, she was blow away because in her village the peasants feed the corn to the pigs.  LOL"

I must admit, I've had a few carp in my life, they are edible, however eating other fish have made me picky and carp are not on the top of my list of fish targeted to eat.  And as a side note I've even tried farm raised Japanese koi sashimi with miso paste in Japan. It's all about how you psychologically look at it. Some say ""yuck"" at sushi and sashimi while others love it. How about the next couple of other examples: caviar and truffles.  I think every culture will have some food we are not accustomed to seeing on our plates or bowls but keeping an open opinion will keep better communications between cultures and less embarrassment at times."
275101,holdfast,2008-12-03 22:02:00,1813,"My Old man used to catch them in the St Lawrence and sell them to Jewish restaurants in Mtl when he was a kid.  Told me it was considered a Jewish Delicacy   Found this on the Internet Gefilte fish (filled fish) was traditionally made by cutting fish into parts. The bones were taken out, the skin removed, and the flesh chopped fine and mixed with eggs, salt, pepper, and onions. This mass is then replaced in the skin, dropped into fish broth and simmered. Modern preparations omit the skin, making quenelles. While traditionally made with carp, gefilte fish is made in other countries according to what sort of fish is available, including cod, haddock, or hake in the United Kingdom, carp or pike in France, or whitefish in the United States. Polish gefilte fish is particularly noted for being sweetened, an unusual flavoring in other eastern European Jewish communities.[176]"

274913,Greencoachdog,2008-12-03 12:03:00,8163," I think Carp and the Carp family are more omnivorous, they will eat certain types of vegetation, vegetables, berries, and fruit... otherwise you wouldn't be able to catch them on corn, cereal, cottonseed cakes, and fruit flavored baits. Big Carp and Buffalo will eat just about anything to maintain their massive bulks.  There are folks down here in the deep South that eat Carp. The usual recipe is to either grind up the raw meat bones and all of pressure cook the meat bones and all, then mix the meat with a breading and for it into patties that are fried or baked to make a ""Sal-mon"" (the less educated pronounce the L in Salmon) patty or croquette."
