274319,ch312,2008-12-02 03:00:00,1590," people who dont have a clue what they are talking about shouldnt even open their mouths  many of the guys that go on safari to LEGALLY hunt lion, elephant, giraffe, zebra, crocs, hippo, etc donate the animal to local tribes. they have the hides shipped back to their homeland or have the trophies mounted and then shipped. im guessing some of them even have meat shipped back to their country?  these hunts are pricey apparently its worth it.  danbo, trophy hunting is somewhat of a status symbol but it does not make a hunter feel dominant over nature. trophy hunters have great control over themselves as they will pick 1 animal and try to take ONLY that animal passing up what normal hunters would shoot in a heartbeat."
274326,danbo,2008-12-02 03:16:00,2646,I used to hunt.. I know what I'm talking about..
274334,ch312,2008-12-02 03:26:00,1590, lol you know what you are talking about because you used to hunt? maybe you felt that hunting is a way for people to be dominant over animals when you were a hunter which is what made you stop? its a good thing you dont anymore if you think like that  animals are on this earth for 1 reason...to fill our bellies!
274337,rickster,2008-12-02 03:28:00,495,
274339,danbo,2008-12-02 03:29:00,2646,You sure talk big behind your keyboard..  I must admit I never arrowed an Elephant or a lion..so what do I know ? Eh Jr.??
274343,danbo,2008-12-02 03:39:00,2646,Heres why I quit hunting...   
274345,kemper,2008-12-02 03:42:00,2232,  People who arent paying attention should read before they post.  I never said anything about legal trophy hunts for the rich businessmen that need to shoot something rare. Personally I dont agree with that either BUT if its legal then I keep my mouth shut.  Im talking about the poaching of animals for no good reason.
274347,danbo,2008-12-02 03:45:00,2646,
274351,rickster,2008-12-02 03:48:00,495,thanks danbo  always wondered how they lured in lions and elephants
274405,cram,2008-12-02 05:53:00,1733,Love the samsquatch video....gave me a great big chuckle.
274509,fishing n autograph,2008-12-02 15:45:00,2540,wow...this goes from a discussion about samsquatches or us hairier folk to the ethics and morality of hunting for sport....only on OFC!
274540,BUSTER,2008-12-02 17:49:00,1336,"ahh com'on stick with us,  u meant to post i liked the sasquach vid!  right guys................or girls help us shange the subject!"
274077,fishing n autograph,2008-12-01 18:37:00,2540,"So I've been watching the free preview of the hunting station (rogers 397) and around 1:00 Easton Bowhunting Adventures comes on. Today I was watching them hunt brown bears in Colorado. The interesting thing was, was that the host kept commenting about how he feels like he's being watched. He was under the impression that he was being stalked by a large bear. Anyway, he ends up checking out the stealth cameras that he set up and finds this:  http://www.hunttv.com/video/latest/27  and no, it's not TJ walking around without a shirt!"
274094,rickster,2008-12-01 19:29:00,495,saw that episode a few weeks back  looks like another saskamawatch
274098,Raf,2008-12-01 19:33:00,3495,samsquanch!
274109,kemper,2008-12-01 19:51:00,2232,"Will someone just SHOOT one of the dang things already!  Jeez, I want to know if the buggers are out there (personally, it wouldnt surprise me if there is the odd ape/creature out there in the dense bush)   ""Bubs, are  you watching the documentary about the saskatchewans?"""
274111,bukee,2008-12-01 19:56:00,58,Samsquatches are hard to shoot because they have trained the 'Southern Ontario Cougar' to protect them and cover their tracks.  I have also heard that the MNR releases 1 SAMsquatch with each pair of cougars it releases.  This is all done to control the feral closet hippo problem.
274114,kemper,2008-12-01 19:58:00,2232," Ill shoot one, someone give me the gun.  If its a fat guy wandering around in a ape suit then I figure he deserves it anyways.   Blast away!"
274123,purekgw,2008-12-01 20:20:00,585,  haha thats so good

274155,MCTFisher9120,2008-12-01 21:15:00,3761, LOL...it's sad the trailer pary boys are putting a end to the show.  btw those things are not real.

274212,Clampet,2008-12-01 23:39:00,1947,
274223,glen,2008-12-02 00:05:00,2641,Nice one Clamp-it.  FishnNAutographs the one you posted looks like a man with the sun behind him so he looks dark.

274244,misfish,2008-12-02 00:48:00,29133,"Well with all the fun with the squasman,can I ask a question here? I just tuned in and see the Safari hunt. BTW,THANKS FOR THE HEADS UP.  Im not sure how to say this, as I am a hunter and can relate to trophy hunting, deer.bear,moose. CAN ANYONE TELL ME WHAT SHOOTING A LION DOES FOR THEM? Do they eat the meat? Just asking. I can see antilope and boar,gazills,or what ever thier called.  Again,just asking. Thanks"
274255,danbo,2008-12-02 01:20:00,2646,To feel dominant over nature. Purely a status symbol.
274271,kemper,2008-12-02 01:52:00,2232,"  People shoot crocs, gators, elephants etc as well. Trophy hunters, and imo they should  face the same fate as the animals they (illegally) took down"
274272,danbo,2008-12-02 01:56:00,2646,It can be legal too. It's sort of a rich man's thrill-seek.
274274,richyb,2008-12-02 01:59:00,774, do you really think they are going to shoot an animal illegally on tv ? different cultures eat diffferent foods so im sure when they harvest an elephant or a lion or a gator the meat does not go to waste.
274279,kemper,2008-12-02 02:03:00,2232,"  I should have been more specific, I was not directly relating to the show it was a general statement.  There is a whole lot of illegal trophy hunting that happens all over the world killing many protected species"
274280,danbo,2008-12-02 02:04:00,2646,They usually donate all the meat to the locals that assist on the hunt. Its a big Tourist industry that helps the countries manage the wildlife.
274295,Mattones,2008-12-02 02:22:00,587,Those are kind of people who have no respect for wildlife. I can only wish one day those people will see what their doing.
