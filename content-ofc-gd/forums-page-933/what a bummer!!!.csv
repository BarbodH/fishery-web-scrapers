My only problem was , the wife was with me and every time I picked up something she would tell me to put it down, Santa needed to be able to get presents for me.  All I could do was wander around and drool, I had the money to buy but not the blessings from the better half, I hope Santa comes through with all the things I couldn't get myself."
274404,snag,2008-12-02 05:52:00,1932,Should've sent her in a different direction!

274414,limeyangler,2008-12-02 08:19:00,5204,"lol...you might not think this is a problem...lol...but....i have almost the opposite occur whenever i'm in winnipeg...either of the three big stores there. my wife actively encourages me to buy stuff because  ""we wont be up for a while"" . Problem is we really dont have the money to throw around....and i feel to guilty and irresponsible to do it....usually"

Just be ready to pack her bags and send her on a HUGE GUILT trip if she doesn't come through!!!! It is one thing if they get you something wrong because they just don't know but if you show em there is NO excuse LOL."
274880,jediangler,2008-12-03 05:30:00,1923,I thought letting the wife loose in the Vaughn Mall while I shopped at Bass Pro was a good idea. She spent twice what I did in half the time. That'll teach me   .
274885,forrest,2008-12-03 05:41:00,1032,She is your better half  By chance do you have a large pile of unused purchases?  forrest
