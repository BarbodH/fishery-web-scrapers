271354,bigugli,2008-11-24 16:07:00,6138,"As I sit here, stranded at home for the day, I have a lot of time to reflect on my fishing year. Finally made the effort to join OFC. A smart decision. You guys are a hoot. It's not the numbers of fish caught. Like Dan C., I can go and catch fish anytime. It's the quality of my outings and the time I share.               I am only so glad to have had the opportunity to share my time, and my passion, with others. I get my biggest kick watching youngsters and newbies catching any fish. I am blessed with good friends and a loving family who make my days out a joy. Life is far too short to worry about how many or how big. The biggest catch are those in the net beside me."
271363,jwl,2008-11-24 16:33:00,1056,"I know you always have a good time out there Ug,a good mixed bag of fish always sees your boat or the banks, and from the pics, I see you even keep some pretty good company out there too"
271370,Leecher,2008-11-24 16:41:00,7832,"Great report and pics Bruce  Thanks for taking the time to put this report together You sure had good quality time out there, congratulation Leechman"

271473,bigugli,2008-11-24 21:25:00,6138,"Thanks for the kind words guys.  Since I was a little one, fishing was  a family thing. It is always  more fun when there is somebody around to share the day. That way I always have a scapegoat for when the day goes wrong"
271476,snag,2008-11-24 21:36:00,1932,"Nice one,  Happy family shots there.  Cheers,  S."

271989,ccmtcanada,2008-11-26 02:21:00,7971,"The smiles in these pictures tell the whole story.  Fishing, family, friends...doesn't get much better than that.  Some of my most memorable outings didn't have big fish in them.  Glad that you joined the board too...I've enjoyed reading your reports and look forward to many more!!"
271999,Mike the Pike,2008-11-26 02:35:00,3421,Mice recap of your year I love the shot of the little guys gathered around the bucket
273187,Streamerguy,2008-11-29 03:18:00,121," You sir are a Lucky man to have your daughter's fish with you...(I envy you)  Great report Bruce,you seem like the fella who truly deserves it   Streamerguy "
273267,bigugli,2008-11-29 14:02:00,6138,"Only the pike queen is my daughter. The other girls are my son's girlfriends. I get them to come out and put them on bigger fish than the son is catching. He hates that   But they get to enjoy something different and  keep coming out for more. Like I said, the real fun is in sharing my time with others.  I still like going out with my daughter for some ""silly fishing""  Like the person who caught the fewest rockies or gills, etc... buys .  Of course Dad will try hard but we both 'know' who is going to be the 'loser'"
273277,MCTFisher9120,2008-11-29 14:57:00,3761,Very nice report man. I really like all those pike!  Thanks for the report
273281,tbayboy,2008-11-29 15:28:00,1497,"Great recap Bruce, it's always a pleasure to see so many friend and families in reports like this - that's what fishing is all about.  Thanks."
274816,rockfish,2008-12-03 03:05:00,91,"Hey I recognize a few ppl in the pics, in fact I know almost all of them.   I haven't been reading the forums too much lately due to work but been getting some time now to do some catching up. I'll just add a few names to the pics of Bruce's fishin family (only 4 of them are actually related   ).      Bruce is a great guy to fish with and we had lots of fun times this year. Been out in his boat a few times and he's always generous in sharing his custom made ugliboy bucktail harnesses and whatever bait he has. Almost time to plan another ice fishing trip to Keswick."
274841,jwl,2008-12-03 03:50:00,1056,"thanks Dave, I been trying to figure out who all the people where since Ugli put that up  You are right..The Uglies are a great gang, lots of good family times amd values...and great friends to spend time on and around the water with, or have a great socail gathering, fishfry,whatever excuse to get together about, and a great help on the cheffing skills at my camp too"
274882,bigugli,2008-12-03 05:35:00,6138,Now yer gonna have everybody believing I'm a nice guy or sumthin. Just fer that I'm gonna have to have someones guts fer garters  Thanks for the kudos guys.
275113,lunkerbasshunter,2008-12-03 22:13:00,2585,sure looked like a great year!!!!  cheers!
275181,rockfish,2008-12-04 00:12:00,91, Well we knew u know who everyone is cuz most of us have fished together and didn't think everyone else did.   Bruce really hasn't posted some of his best fish and it's almost time to get out his propane deep fryer again to cook us up some more tasty critters.  Sorry Bruce putting u to work again but we'll supply the ketchup.
