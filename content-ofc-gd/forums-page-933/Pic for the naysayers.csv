274909,Rich,2008-12-03 11:52:00,3927,Yeaaaahhh.. it's because of those reasons I don't post photos or stories of my huge muskies!  Yep. Certainly not because I never catch any.
274935,BillM,2008-12-03 13:00:00,17367,"  Nice to see you man!!  I thought you disappeared into the woodwork  I have no doubts about your monster, personally I think anyone who questions any fish of this stature is simply jealous."
274167,Whopper,2008-12-01 21:40:00,2174,Terry I think the man deserves your handiwork
274172,Terry,2008-12-01 22:01:00,14456,and then some  
274190,Rich Clemens,2008-12-01 22:46:00,3131,Yeah ... Oh to catch one half that size.  (I'm still dreaming).   Congrats and my hat's off for letting her go.
274192,MuskyBill,2008-12-01 22:49:00,311,"Great fish, kudos for the release!!"
274197,Chris,2008-12-01 23:01:00,405,Congratulations to the angler on a very impressive catch.....and thanks for releasing that girl
274203,Weeds,2008-12-01 23:13:00,782,Whoah. One thing's for sure. That is one big bass.
274207,outllaw,2008-12-01 23:31:00,1232,"Truly an amazing catch. my hats off to the angler. just think,,,guys. this man lays no claim to fame. the most important thing. he released a true trophy.  . mr. mcnair has set a standard many would love to meet. that fish was put back, unselfish i must say. after 45 years chasin skies, myself , im very impressed to see musky hunting taken to a new level.  to all the guys like myself looking for the next big girl, its proven cpr works."
274211,dheitzner,2008-12-01 23:35:00,314,"What a pig!!! Probably been said  a million times in this thread, but good on the angler for letting that giant swim. Very selfless act, and he should be applauded for it."
274257,ctdd2006,2008-12-02 01:23:00,531,Wow!  Hats off!  One of a kind fish and perhaps angler!  Congrats to all involved!  Cheers!
274285,Crazyhook,2008-12-02 02:10:00,1154,"Beauty musky and nice to see it go back!  As for the world record you have to follow the rules for the IGFA and there are many. I broke a line class fly record 2 years ago and it did not count.  here is the list of rules http://www.igfa.org/BookRule2004.pdf  everyone is whining about no pics of the fish with a tape, well too many pics can stress and kill a fish. The angler did a great job in releasing that fish."
274286,Rich,2008-12-02 02:14:00,3927,I just crapped in my cornflakes.. that's insane
274312,Pigeontroller,2008-12-02 02:49:00,2793,  Run Forest run!  Sorry couldn't help it. Actually more than a few of the posters in this thread KNOW the angler in question.
274468,douG,2008-12-02 13:32:00,2693,"Thumper: He doesn't walk very good, does he? Mrs. Rabbit: Thumper! Thumper: Yes, mama? Mrs. Rabbit: What did your father tell you this morning? Thumper: [clears throat] If you can't say something nice... don't say nothing at all."
274469,Carp,2008-12-02 13:37:00,1488,"  O'Brien's fish was caught in October 1988 if I remember correctly. I was fishing that area for a couple of weekends before and a few weekends after that fish was caught. For a reason I can't remember right now, we skipped the weekend that pig decided to chomp on a bait. The week after it was caught, I was shown a muskie wrapped in plastic in a large chest freezer by a rental cottage owner and was told it was the big beast. It was the only thing in the freezer and lay on an angle from corner to corner because it was too long to lay straight. Supposedly, it was awaiting some scientific testing, etc., etc. I couldn't understand why it was still there a week after it was caught ??? Could it have been a different ski ???  I didn't question it. Off to fish I went.  The fish in this post is a monster. Congrats to the lucky angler."
274513,Pondo,2008-12-02 15:57:00,36,Wow!  It's bigger than mine   ....  
274528,Musky or Specks,2008-12-02 17:09:00,2710,Just to add my two cents. That is a huge fish!!!! Couldnt have released it myself. Personally I feel the scientific information that could have been gathered on a fish of that size is way more important than 1 or if lucky 2 more spawns. Thats assuming that it even makes it through the winter after having undergone the stress of being caught.
274532,OhioFisherman,2008-12-02 17:27:00,6623," Dang Ponto, I lip them!"
274543,Squid,2008-12-02 17:51:00,1656," Forrest, wah wah?? we do not need to take the ""strangers"" word for it as we can identify the size of the fish from the picture. So if you are unable to judge the size, then just say nice fish and be happy that someone shared a catch of a lifetime. No need to ask for proof or measurements as this will not change the size of the fish. Just enjoy the pictutre and dream the dream of catching one this big."
274586,Spiel,2008-12-02 19:45:00,9065,....Should of lopped it's damn head off! It's clearly been dining on steelhead.
274611,misfish,2008-12-02 20:41:00,29133," Yes, but he,s a fine looking NFLD fella aint he?  :clapping:LOL  Sorry,thats a real nice fish. Dont understand whats going on about this catch. Wish it was me who caught it.  Congrats to the angler.   Do you know how many stories that are out there about guys catching 9 pound smallies on Simcoe.If they say they did,hey,they did. Im sure they are out there."
274638,Guest steel'n'esox,2008-12-02 21:29:00,0,"wow congradulations on a truly remarkable muskie, very healthy and thick from head to tail, for all the doubters on this board that fish eats fish the size of the ones you continually post pictures of. No tape beside the fish required that fish speaks for herself, I even heard the shimano live release boat offered to take the fish to the Niagra so Lew could catch her on the 13th, but the angler said nope she goes back where she was caught. Had to throw that in there as they just dont grow that big where your trailer is and where we both have been known to pluck a few out once in a while."
274695,camillj,2008-12-02 23:27:00,1988,I've lost bigger
274800,shane,2008-12-03 02:33:00,652,  HaHaHaHa!  That's the best post out of this whole thread.
274849,muskymike,2008-12-03 04:04:00,772, they are in the shadows lew.....   remember august 16th bill....
274906,singingdog,2008-12-03 11:46:00,1047,A thread only goes south when people start responding to the disturbers. The guys that want to argue are laughing when you respond to them....you are giving them exactly what they want. Nothing shuts up a troll faster than not being responded to.
274164,Terry,2008-12-01 21:30:00,14456,it's a beautiful fish and it still swims   thank you and way to go
273995,pikehunter,2008-12-01 14:58:00,1659,"Doesn't matter if the measurements are accurate or not. It's a BIG FISH regardless of what any Tom Dick or Harry's opinion is on the size of this brute. Maybe the size and girth were guesstimates  Maybe they did indeed take measurements  Like has been said, if they had posted pictures of the process then there would have been criticism for the way it was done and surely there would have been even more negativity here. Maybe the measurements were only quoted to give a better understanding of this beauties size?  This guy must feel like a lottery winner. Happy at first but then have to listen to all the whining from the wannabes.  Congrates to him for his victory!  Kudos to Roy and Lew."
273997,Raf,2008-12-01 15:07:00,3495,"i see the peanut gallery is out in full force here.  from the comfort of their couch.  instead of experiencing what fishing in 3.5' waves, in late nov, at night, is like.  heck, maybe even experiencing what it feels like to catch a fish like this.  congrats to the angler.. it's a beauty!"
274006,cram,2008-12-01 15:29:00,1733,"Why was it still eating?  Amazing.  Lew -- do pike fatten up like that in late fall?  I assume they're chowing down on the condensed schools of baitfish as well, but i have never caught a fat one...even late in the season."
274007,Guest gbfisher,2008-12-01 15:37:00,0,HAHAHAHAHA YES LEW????.....what about pike?..................   Thats classic asking Lew about Pike. (only becuase he doesnt fish for pike) The last pike I saw Lew catch didnt even make it out of the water. and was released before I could turn around.... Im not making fun of you there bud. Just laughing hard at the expression on Lews face when he reads this ....   Very nice fish.
274008,TJQ,2008-12-01 15:44:00,7806,That is awesome!!!  What a fish!! A fish of a lifetime for sure!!
274009,cram,2008-12-01 15:49:00,1733, :-)  no worries.   Didn't know.  Maybe i shouldn't have asked about pike in this thread anyway.  Pretty off-topic.
274011,mikeh,2008-12-01 15:54:00,824,"awesome fish . must have been quite the experience 3.5"" waves, in the dark, probably 25 km winds, and the fish was released to be caught another day."
273888,Weekend Angler,2008-12-01 03:24:00,13,"Hi Guys;  I see the original thread is locked. Too bad it went that way.  Here is a pic of the fish from the Larry on Friday. 57""x33"" Released.  No record requested. No glory. Just a nice big Muskie released for someone else to catch...  BTW the angler is over 300lbs just to give some perspective on the size.  Enjoy  "
273893,pigeonfisher,2008-12-01 03:26:00,696,"That shoal carp would make a lot of stew!  Trolling or Casting?  DANG, BEER, WINGS, ELITISM"
273896,BeRad3000,2008-12-01 03:31:00,65,AWESOME!
273899,Weekend Angler,2008-12-01 03:32:00,13,Trolling was the ticket I believe in 3.5 ft waves...
273900,Grimace,2008-12-01 03:36:00,2020,Incredible fish.   Look at that gut.   Wicked
273903,ehg,2008-12-01 03:39:00,2666,"But that is a huge musky! Martin Williamson's fish from Nov 2000 was kept, 55.5""length by 31.5 girth and weighed 61.4 lbs.  That musky there from the St. Lawrence is easily bigger, maybe over 65 lbs. Amazing! Thanks for posting that!"
273904,glen,2008-12-01 03:40:00,2641,Weekend Angler thankyou for the picture.  That is one big fish.  Look at the size of the gut and the huge tail.
273905,Greencoachdog,2008-12-01 03:43:00,8163,"Very nice Hogski!!!  I've got to admit that I'm a little disappointed that there aren't any length and girth measurement pics, but that's ok I guess.  It's still a very big fish!"
273906,Wild,2008-12-01 03:48:00,704,No glory you say? I say highest respects go to the angler for catch and release.What a beautiful Muskie.
273907,Jigger,2008-12-01 03:50:00,1237,Thats a special fish right there. Congatulations to the lucky angler! Simply awesome. I hope that one day I can tangle with one even close to that. And at night! In 3.5 foot waves?! Sick.  Or do we need a stick to verify the height of the waves GCD?
273910,forrest,2008-12-01 03:56:00,1032,"umm.....yeah I would like to have seen the pics with the measurements/weight too (I am with GCD on this....he knows its a kick butt fish too)  Nothing to say that it is a world record, just an uncommonly huge honking once in a lifetime fish!  forrest"
273911,glen,2008-12-01 03:57:00,2641,
273915,cram,2008-12-01 04:08:00,1733,GCD and Forrest -- i don't believe the guy claimed (at least on the othe boards) that its a world record.  From what i can tell he's not exactly claiming anything other than caught a giant fish of a lifetime that he set free to swim another day.
273916,cram,2008-12-01 04:10:00,1733,I can't believe the belly.....why was it still eating?  I guess what they say about muskies putting on the feedbag in the fall is bang-on.  Anyone know if the Ken OBrien fish was caught in the late fall? It had a GIANT belly as well.  Also - anyone know if pike load up like this in the late fall as well?  Assuming the muskies are getting big while feasting on the baitfish schooling and spawning....i have to think the big pike are there as well?
273924,forrest,2008-12-01 04:45:00,1032,"so?: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_troll . . . . It is a fish of a lifetime. A fish of 57"" x 33"" would be almost a sure bet for the world record.  So, if anyone does catch a world record muskie then please submit it for the record ......forget about mercy for the Musky....think about mercy for all of those that waste time debating the current record.  type into google ""world muskie record controversy"" to see what I mean.  forrest"
273925,scuro2,2008-12-01 05:10:00,904,"I enjoyed seeing that healthy muskie, no blood, and a smiling face. That is the way it should be. I'd throw her back too."
273928,BassAsin,2008-12-01 05:50:00,806,what a beauty fish i've only ever caught one it was a 24 pounder in late summer/fall on some heavy bass tackle had a huge gut like that as well
273939,lew,2008-12-01 10:23:00,12767," That's what it's all about and congrats to the angler, it's a monster fish for sure.  Without asking for details about the location of that brute, it'd be intersting to know the depth she was caught and the lure that enticed her ??"
273940,Whopper,2008-12-01 11:21:00,2174,"Awesome fish, a true tanker.  Congrats to the angler"
273948,TroutnMuskieHunter,2008-12-01 12:35:00,1362,A great picture of a happy angler with his trophy Muskie!!  ....congrats to the angler and I'm sure he'll have memories bout that fish for the rest of his life!!
273953,lew,2008-12-01 12:55:00,12767,"   I'm just curious as to why anyone would want to see a photograph of the tape measurements after the angler has already said what the size of this fish was ??   This is one of the main reasons why so many musky fishermen never post pictures or stories of big fish, as it's just not worth the aggravation or doubtful accusations of so many others, and what's even worse, is so very often the remarks come from people who have never caught or even seen a big musky in their lives.  It'd be nice to have the angler who caught the monster in this story join this board and tell us some of his other fishing tales, but I kinda doubt that'll happen now that he's basically been called a liar on one of the most read fishing boards in Ontario.  We've lost several excellent musky fishermen from this board in the last couple years and comments like these are one of the main reasons they left."
273954,Roy,2008-12-01 12:59:00,13728,That is one spectacular fish no matter WHOSE ruler you're using. Congrats to the folks who braved the elements to bring us this monster and also for putting her back where she lives.  Just beautiful!
273957,holdfast,2008-12-01 13:06:00,1813,"Got to really respect a guy like that considering the health of the Fishery than anyone elses judgement.  Obviously professional and it give us or you the chance to catch him or his offspring one day.  Great pic, wonder when itll be on the cover of Ontario Outdoors, because its got to be, maybe thats his glory in the end."
273958,Greencoachdog,2008-12-01 13:07:00,8163," Sorry to have ruffled your feathers Lew, but if I caught a fish that big... you can bet your butt that there would be length and girth pics!!!  Evidently he had to have measured it to come up with those figures, whats wrong with snapping a pic of the measuring process???  We haven't heard from that angler directly, and things have a way of being exaggerated when they come second, third, and fourth hand.  I'm not trying to take anything away from the angler or the fish, congrats to the angler on a fish of a lifetime and much respect to him for releasing it back to keep it in the gene pool."
273960,lew,2008-12-01 13:13:00,12767," I spose if he was interested in proving anything to anybody, he'd have clubbed that big girl over the head and killed it, but obviously that's not his style and good on him for that.  Guess he never thought it was his responsibility to prove himself to a bunch of strangers.....and good on him for that too."
