275206,Guest buick14,2008-12-04 01:21:00,0,"Hi all,  I need some quick advice/help  I am buying (well almost 98%certain) a nice fiberglass 1999' ranger boat which is not mint, but well worth the price  its a nice boat, and think it would look good if it were buffed..???  The hull is fiberglass, and well it looks like it has lost its ""shine"" and looks a little dull.....  Does this mean the clearcoat is gone, and I will have to wax it every time I come back from being in the sun? or does it just mean it needs a wax job? Is there something which I can rub on the hull to protect it for a while and make it shine that while longer..or like a good hull restorer??  any/all info is appreciated..... including guestimates on how long certain waxes may last/clear coat products etc etc  thank you very much!!!!!!!!1 -MS"

275237,Wild,2008-12-04 02:09:00,704,The best thing to do is take a clear pic and contact Ranger for their advice especially if you have metalflake.
275239,purekgw,2008-12-04 02:11:00,585,yah like wild said contact  ranger they  do touch ups and restores the shine in there boat seen on real fishing
275251,moparhawk,2008-12-04 02:30:00,146, mek will clean just about anything but it also takes all the oil out of your skin for days. wear gloves
275255,irishfield,2008-12-04 02:36:00,26272,One drop in your eye will also blind you in ~15 seconds if you don't get it rinsed out immediately.....and why I don't have any in my shop... ;O)
275257,danbo,2008-12-04 02:44:00,2646,"I worked with MEK for 10 years in the printing industry. Goggle & gloves is standard safety. Why does everybody ""Pipe-in"" after I found the guys answer?"
275258,irishfield,2008-12-04 02:47:00,26272,Danbo... is there anything in your link that says to protect your eyes?  Line #2... there's more than one way to clean a boat!

275426,The Urban Fisherman,2008-12-04 15:39:00,2050,"maybe it's a transformer - ""custom faded""  ya have to be a movie geek to get it."
275434,bassjnkie,2008-12-04 16:05:00,1101,Just apply a gel coat every year or so. Probably give the best results. OR if your buying the boat for a steal get it clear coated again.
275445,jwl,2008-12-04 16:45:00,1056,"is there and crazing(small cracks) in the finish???? if you don't know the persons you might be buying it off, and how they ran the boat it may be a sign of stress on the hull...some guys run the crap out of thier bass boats  , if it's just faded a good hull cleaner or buffing agent should do it...not sure the brand I used before on our old bow rider, I will see if I can find the bottle around here...but it used to shine the boat up like it was new again"
275506,legacey,2008-12-04 19:22:00,127,"I know it's not the best to use environmentally but last year, I used WD40 for a while. My boat looked horrible so I sprayed a bit on a shammy and wiped the boat with it. She's an old girl and not the most desirable but she's my first.  It made a huge difference to the look but my buddy who's a car body man, told me I screwed the ability to get it re-done.  Thankfully, he was wrong and I had the boat completely refinshed with a supposed new product on the market at my marine place I deal with.  A guy just moved to Kingston from BC and with this new application, brought the boat back to it's original look for really cheap so he could use it as a promotion.  If you want to PM me, I can get his contact information if you wish.  Here's before and this was with WD40 on it so it looked better than it had.....I'll post the finished picture next; it's too large for this one.  Cheers,  Paul "

275528,Reelpro,2008-12-04 20:14:00,73,"I used the 3M kit on a pretty badly faded out hull and it came back like new.  Used a power buffer, you may be able to rent one. The kit had 3 bottles, one with a grit that pulled all the oxidation out with the buffer.  a bit of elbow grease, but inexpensive and great results."
